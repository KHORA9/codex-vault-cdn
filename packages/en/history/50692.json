The storm which had long been\r\nbrewing broke just as Cicero returned from Cilicia over the question\r\nof Caesar's resignation of office. By the agreement made in 56 B.C.\r\nCaesar's governorship of Gaul was renewed for five years and he was\r\nthen to be re-elected to the consulship in 48 B.C. As the renewal dated\r\nfrom March 1, 54 B.C., his term of office would naturally expire on\r\nMarch 1, 49 B.C.: but according to the rule in vogue at the time of the\r\nreappointment he would not be superseded until Jan. 1, 48 B.C., the\r\ndate on which he would enter on the consulship. He would therefore hold\r\noffice continually, and his enemies, the Senatorial party, would have\r\nno chance of bringing a prosecution against him, which might be fatal\r\nto his career. But in 52 B.C. they had induced Pompey to bring forward\r\na new law by which ex-magistrates did not proceed to a province as soon\r\nas their office ended but after an interval of five years. Consequently\r\nfor the next five years special appointments had to be made by the\r\nSenate--for example Cicero's appointment to Cilicia--and, as they could\r\nbe made at any time, it would be perfectly easy to supersede Caesar\r\non March 1, 49, and secure his prosecution, condemnation and downfall\r\nbefore he could enter on the consulship.\r\n\r\nAnother new law of Pompey's insisted on the personal attendance of\r\ncandidates for office, from which Caesar had previously obtained\r\nspecial exemption. On the remonstrance of Caesar's friends Pompey had\r\ninserted a clause allowing such special exemptions to stand: but this\r\nclause was never properly passed. This again was designed to ensure\r\nCaesar's presence in Rome, with a view to his prosecution.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two years the question of his resignation was\r\ncontinually coming up in the House, but no definite conclusion\r\nwas reached, owing largely to Curio's spirited attacks on all the\r\nSenatorial party's proposals. That party however was ready to catch at\r\nany trifle to pick a quarrel with Caesar: and they found an opportunity\r\nwhen in Sept. 50 B.C. Caesar decided to send the 13th legion into\r\nCisalpine Gaul to replace the 15th, which he had had to surrender,\r\nnominally for the war in Syria, though actually the legion was kept\r\nin Italy. A report was circulated that he was sending four legions to\r\nPlacentia with hostile intentions. The report was disproved by Curio:\r\nbut, though the majority of the Senate supported the opposition, and\r\nrefused to declare Caesar a public enemy, Marcellus, the consul, took\r\nupon himself to appoint Pompey to the command over two legions with\r\nauthority to raise more against Caesar. On his return to Cisalpine\r\nGaul in November, Caesar ignored this illegal commission and privately\r\noffered to give up Transalpine Gaul on March 1, if allowed to keep\r\nCisalpine Gaul and Illyricum with two legions or even Illyricum with\r\none. It was at this juncture that Cicero returned to Italy, and he\r\nseems to have spoken in favour of accepting this proposal, though\r\nshocked at Caesar's \"impudence\" in making it. But neither Pompey nor\r\nthe Senatorial party took it seriously, and Caesar was forced to send\r\nan ultimatum stating that he would resign only if Pompey did the same.\r\nThe Senate replied that, if he did not resign, he would be declared\r\na public enemy: and, when their motion to that effect was vetoed by\r\nAntony and Cassius, the latter met with the same treatment and had to\r\nflee to Caesar in company with Curio.\r\n\r\nOn hearing their report Caesar took the first step in the war by\r\ncrossing the Rubicon. His march southward was so quickly executed that\r\nPompey and the consuls evacuated Rome. Negotiations for peace failed.\r\nDomitius with eighteen cohorts at Corfinium was taken prisoner, and\r\nPompey retreated to Brundisium on his way to Greece. Hurrying after\r\nhim Caesar blockaded the town: but Pompey succeeded in effecting\r\nhis escape. Meantime Cicero was exhibiting the weakest side of his\r\ncharacter. At the first outbreak he offered to go with Pompey: but he\r\nwas given the command of Capua and the Campanian coast. This command he\r\nresigned in a few days: later he set out to join Pompey at Brundisium,\r\nbut retreated for fear of capture: and thereafter for months he\r\nremained at Formiae shilly-shallying and writing querulous letters to\r\nAtticus for advice. However, when he met Caesar on his return from\r\nBrundisium to Rome, he had sufficient courage to refuse to take a seat\r\nin the House and support his demands.\r\n\r\nCaesar's stay in Rome was short and marked only by his seizure of the\r\npublic treasury and the appointment of his friends Lepidus and Antony\r\nas prefect of the city and military commander respectively. Then he\r\nhastened to Spain, where, after nearly meeting with a disaster, he\r\ndefeated the five legions under Afranius and Petreius at Ilerda, and\r\ngained the whole peninsula. While the issue was still uncertain\r\nin Spain, and indeed things looked unfavourable to Caesar, Cicero\r\nscrewed up his courage and joined Pompey in Epirus. Meantime Sardinia\r\nwas occupied by Caesar's adjutant P. Valerius and Sicily gave way to\r\nCurio. The latter passed on to Africa, where after some success he met\r\nwith defeat and death at the hands of Juba. It was not till January\r\n48 B.C. that Caesar effected a landing in Epirus, where he proceeded\r\nto surround Pompey's camp near Dyrrachium: but his lines were broken\r\nthrough and he sustained a slight defeat. He retired towards Thessaly\r\nand there in August won a decisive victory over Pompey at Pharsalus.\r\nPompey fled to Cyprus and thence to Egypt, there to meet his death. The\r\nrest of the party split up, some going to Africa to carry on the war,\r\nothers to Greece and Asia to make terms for themselves with Caesar.\r\nCicero after a violent quarrel with his brother at Patrae returned to\r\nBrundisium, and there spent many miserable months wondering what his\r\nfate would be when Caesar returned. His misfortunes were increased by\r\na rupture with his wife Terentia, and the unfaithfulness and general\r\nmisconduct of his son-in-law Dolabella, which forced him to procure a\r\ndivorce for Tullia.

Saufeius a letter, one for you alone, because, though I\r\nhad no time to write, I was reluctant that so intimate an acquaintance\r\nof yours should come to you without a note from me. But, considering\r\nthe pace of philosophers, I imagine the present letter will reach you\r\nfirst. If, however, you have got that earlier letter now, you will know\r\nthat I arrived at Athens on Oct. 14; that on disembarking at the port\r\nI received your letter from our friend Acastus; that, perturbed though\r\nI was at your arrival in Rome with a fever, nevertheless I began to\r\ntake heart at Acastus' welcome announcement of your convalescence; but\r\nshivered myself at your news of Caesar's legions, and pleaded with you\r\nto beware lest friend Philotimus' time-serving injure us.[2] As for\r\nthe point I touched on long ago (misrepresented to you by Turranius at\r\nBrundisium, as I gathered from a letter received from that good fellow\r\nXeno), I set forth briefly the reason why I had not put my brother\r\nin charge of the province. Those practically were the topics of that\r\nletter. Now hear what remains.\r\n\r\n[2] Cf. vi, 4, 6, 9.\r\n\r\nIn heaven's name, I want all the affection which you have lavished on\r\nme, and all your worldly\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 Page 4\r\n\r\nin omni genere iudico singularem, confer ad eam curam, ut de omni statu\r\nmeo cogites. Videre enim mihi videor tantam dimicationem, nisi idem\r\ndeus, qui nos melius, quam optare auderemus, Parthico bello liberavit,\r\nrespexerit rem publicam,--sed tantam, quanta numquam fuit. Age, hoc\r\nmalum mihi commune est cum omnibus. Nihil tibi mando ut de eo cogites,\r\nillud meum proprium πρόβλεμα, quaeso, suscipe. Videsne, ut te auctore\r\nsim utrumque complexus? Ac vellem a principio te audisse amicissime\r\nmonentem.\r\n\r\n             Ἀλλ' ἐμὸν οὔποτε θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσιν ἔπειθες.\r\n\r\nSed aliquando tamen persuasisti, ut alterum complecterer, quia de me\r\nerat optume meritus, alterum, quia tantum valebat. Feci igitur itaque\r\neffeci omni obsequio, ut neutri illorum quisquam esset me carior.\r\nHaec enim cogitabamus, nec mihi coniuncto cum Pompeio fore necesse\r\npeccare in re publica aliquando nec cum Caesare sentienti pugnandum\r\nesse cum Pompeio. Tanta erat illorum coniunctio. Nunc impendet, ut et\r\ntu ostendis, et ego video, summa inter eos contentio. Me autem uterque\r\nnumerat suum, nisi forte simulat alter. Nam Pompeius non dubitat; vere\r\nenim iudicat ea, quae de re publica nunc sentiat, mihi valde probari.\r\nUtriusque autem accepi eius modi litteras eodem tempore quo tuas, ut\r\nneuter quemquam omnium pluris facere quam me videretur. Verum quid\r\nagam? Non quaero illa ultima (si enim\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 Page 5\r\n\r\nwisdom, which I swear to my mind is unrivalled in every subject, to\r\nbe devoted to a careful estimate of my whole position. For myself, I\r\nseem to foresee a terrific struggle, unless indeed the same god, who\r\nwrought above my boldest hopes in freeing us from a Parthian war, take\r\npity on the state--anyhow, such a terrific struggle as there never has\r\nbeen before. True, the calamity would fall not only on me, but on every\r\none. I don't ask you to consider the wider problem: solve my own little\r\ncase, I entreat. Don't you see that it is you who are responsible\r\nfor my friendship with both Pompey and Caesar? Ah, would that I had\r\nlistened to your friendly admonitions from the outset.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Odyssey ix, 33]\r\n\r\n\"Thou couldst not sway the spirit in my breast.\"\r\n\r\nBut at last, however, you persuaded me to be friendly with the one,\r\nbecause he had done so much for me; with the other, because he was\r\nso powerful. Well, I did so, and I have studiously contrived to be\r\nparticularly dear to both of them. For my idea was this. Allied with\r\nPompey, I should never have to be guilty of political impropriety; and,\r\nsiding with Caesar, I should not have to fight with Pompey. So close\r\nwas the alliance of those two. But now, on your showing and in my view,\r\nthere threatens a dire struggle between them. Each of them counts me\r\nhis friend--unless, perhaps, Caesar is dissembling; for Pompey has\r\nno doubt, rightly supposing that his present political views have my\r\nstrongest approval. But both have sent me letters (which came with\r\nyours) in terms that would appear to make more of me than of anyone at\r\nall. But what am I to do? I don't mean in the long run. If the matter\r\nis to be fought in the\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 Page 6\r\n\r\ncastris res geretur, video cum altero vinci satius esse quam cum\r\naltero vincere), sed illa, quae tum agentur, cum venero, ne ratio\r\nabsentis habeatur, ut exercitum dimittat. \"DIC, M. TVLLI.\" Quid\r\ndicam? \"Exspecta, amabo te, dum Atticum conveniam\"? Non est locus ad\r\ntergiversandum. Contra Caesarem? \"Ubi illae sunt densae dexterae?\" Nam,\r\nut illi hoc liceret, adiuvi rogatus ab ipso Ravennae de Caelio tribuno\r\npl. Ab ipso autem? Etiam a Gnaeo nostro in illo divino tertio consulatu.\r\n\r\nAliter sensero? Αἰδέομαι non Pompeium modo, sed Τρῶας καὶ Τρωάδας.\r\n\r\n               Πουλυδάμας μοι πρῶτος ἐλεγχείην καταθήσει.\r\n\r\nQuis? Tu ipse scilicet, laudator et factorum et scriptorum meorum. Hanc\r\nergo plagam effugi per duos superiores Marcellorum consulatus, cum est\r\nactum de provincia Caesaris, nunc incido in discrimen ipsum? Itaque ut\r\nstultus[3] primus suam sententiam dicat, mihi valde placet de triumpho\r\nnos moliri aliquid, extra urbem esse cum iustissuma causa. Tamen\r\ndabunt operam, ut eliciant sententiam meam. Ridebis hoc loco fortasse.\r\nQuam vellem etiam nunc in provincia morari! Plane opus fuit, si hoc\r\nimpendebat. Etsi nil miserius. Nam, ὁδῦυ πάρεργον, volo te hoc scire.\r\n\r\n[3] _The reading here is debatable._ Sulpicius, Hillus, _and_ alius\r\n_have been suggested in place of_ stultus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 Page 7\r\n\r\nfield, I see it would be better to be beaten with Pompey than\r\nto win with Caesar. But what about the points in debate on my\r\narrival--refusing the claims of a candidate who is away from Rome and\r\nordering the disbanding of his army. \"Your opinion, Marcus Tullius,\"\r\nwill be the question. What am I to say? \"Please wait till I meet\r\nAtticus?\" There is no chance of evasion. I speak against Caesar? \"Where\r\nthen the pledge of plighted hands?\"[4] For I assisted in getting Caesar\r\nprivilege on these two points, when I was asked by him personally at\r\nRavenna to approach Caelius the tribune to propose a bill. Asked by him\r\npersonally, do I say? Yes, and by our friend Pompey in that immortal\r\nthird consulship.\r\n\r\n[4] Probably a quotation from some early poet.\r\n\r\nShall I choose the other course? \"I fear\" not only Pompey, but \"the\r\nmen and long-robed dames of Troy\": \"Polydamas will be the first to\r\nrail.\"[5] Who's he? Why, you, who praise my work and writings. Have I\r\nthen avoided this trap during the last two consulships of the Marcelli,\r\nwhen the matter of Caesar's province was under debate, only to fall\r\nnow into the thick of the trouble? That some fool may have the first\r\nvote on the motion, I feel strongly inclined to devote my energies to\r\nmy triumph, a most reasonable excuse for staying outside the city.\r\nNevertheless they will try to extract my opinion. Perhaps this will\r\nexcite your mirth: I wish to goodness I were still staying in my\r\nprovince. I certainly ought to have stayed, if this was coming: though\r\nit would have been most wretched. For by the way\r\n\r\n[5] _Iliad_ vi, 442, and xxii, 100.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 Page 8\r\n\r\nOmnia illa prima, quae etiam tu tuis litteris in caelum ferebas,\r\nἐπίτηκτα fuerunt. Quam non est facilis virtus! Quam vero difficilis\r\neius diuturna simulatio! Cum enim hoc rectum et gloriosum putarem,\r\nex annuo sumptu, qui mihi decretus esset, me C. Caelio quaestori\r\nrelinquere annuum, referre in aerarium ad HS CIↃ, ingemuit nostra\r\ncohors omne illud putans distribui sibi oportere, ut ego amicior\r\ninvenirer Phrygum et Cilicum aerariis quam nostro. Sed me non moverunt;\r\nnam et mea laus apud me plurimum valuit, nec tamen quicquam honorifice\r\nin quemquam fieri potuit, quod praetermiserim. Sed haec fuerit, ut ait\r\nThucydides, ἐκβολὴ λόγου non inutilis.\r\n\r\nTu autem de nostro statu cogitabis, primum quo artificio tueamur\r\nbenevolentiam Caesaris, deinde de ipso triumpho; quem video, nisi\r\nrei publicae tempora impedient, εὐπόριστον.

Sed tamen gratulans mihi Caesar de supplicatione triumphat\r\nde sententia Catonis nec scribit, quid ille sententiae dixerit, sed\r\ntantum, supplicationem eum mihi non decrevisse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 Page 9\r\n\r\nthere is one thing I want to tell you. All that show of virtue at\r\nfirst, which even you praised sky high in your letters, was only\r\nsuperficial. Truly righteousness is hard: hard even to pretend to it\r\nfor long. For, when I thought it a fine show of rectitude to leave my\r\nquaestor C. Caelius a year's cash out of what was decreed me for my\r\nbudget and to pay back into the treasury £8,800,[6] my staff, thinking\r\nall the money should have been distributed among them, lamented that\r\nI should turn out to be more friendly to the treasuries of Phrygia\r\nand Cilicia than to our own. I was unmoved: for I set my good name\r\nbefore everything. Yet there is no possible honour that I have omitted\r\nto bestow on any of these knaves. This, in Thucydides' phrase, is a\r\ndigression--but not pointless.\r\n\r\n[6] 1,000,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Thuc. i, 97]\r\n\r\nBut as to my position. You will consider first by what trick I can\r\nretain Caesar's good will: and then the matter of my triumph, which,\r\nbarring political obstacles, seems to me easy to get: I infer as\r\nmuch from letters from friends and from that business of the public\r\nthanksgiving in my honour. For the man who voted against it,[7] voted\r\nfor more than if he had voted for all the triumphs in the world;\r\nmoreover his adherents were one a friend of mine, Favonius, and another\r\nan enemy, Hirrus. Cato both took part in drafting the decree, and sent\r\nme a most agreeable letter about his vote. But Caesar, in writing to\r\ncongratulate me over the thanksgiving, exults over Cato's vote, says\r\nnothing about the latter's speech on the occasion, and merely remarks\r\nthat he opposed the proclamation of a thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n[7] Cato.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 10\r\n\r\n\r\nRedeo ad Hirrum. Coeperas eum mihi placare; perfice. Habes Scrofam,\r\nhabes Silium. Ad eos ego et iam antea scripsi ad ipsum Hirrum. Locutus\r\nenim erat cum iis commode se potuisse impedire, sed noluisse; adsensum\r\ntamen esse Catoni, amicissimo meo, cum is honorificentissimam in me\r\nsententiam dixisset; nec me ad se ullas litteras misisse, cum ad omnes\r\nmitterem. Verum dicebat. Ad eum enim solum et ad Crassipedem non\r\nscripseram. Atque haec de rebus forensibus; redeamus domum.\r\n\r\nDiiungere me ab illo volo. Merus est φυρατής, germanus Lartidius.\r\n\r\n             Ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν προτετύχθαι ἐάσομεν ἀχνύμενοί περ.\r\n\r\nReliqua expediamus, hoc primum, quod accessit cura dolori meo. Sed\r\ntamen hoc, quicquid est, Precianum cum iis rationibus, quas ille\r\nmeas tractat, admisceri nolo. Scripsi ad Terentiam, scripsi etiam ad\r\nipsum, me, quicquid possem nummorum, ad apparatum sperati triumphi ad\r\nte redacturum. Ita puto ἄμεμπτα fore; verum ut lubebit. Hanc quoque\r\nsuscipe curam, quem ad modum experiamur.

You have begun to reconcile him to me;\r\naccomplish it. Scrofa and Silius are on your side. I have already\r\nwritten to them and to Hirrus himself. For Hirrus had told them in a\r\nfriendly way that he could easily have prevented the decree, but was\r\nreluctant; that, however, he had sided with Cato, my very good friend,\r\nwhen the latter recorded a vote complimenting me in the highest terms.\r\nHirrus added that I had omitted to write to him, though I had sent\r\nletters to every one else. He was right. It was only to him and to\r\nCrassipes that I did not write. So much for public life. Let us come\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nI wish to dissociate myself from that fellow Philotimus. He is a\r\nveritable muddler, a regular Lartidius[8].\r\n\r\n[8] Taken by the older commentators to be a Latin form of Λαερτιάδης\r\n(i.e. Ulysses); but the sense does not seem to warrant the comparison,\r\nwhich could only mean \"as wily as Ulysses.\"\r\n\r\n\"A truce to what is past for all our pain.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[9] _Iliad_ xviii, 112; xix, 65, \"Let bygones be bygones.\"\r\n\r\nLet us settle what remains; and first this point, which adds anxiety\r\nto my sorrow. This sum, I mean, whatever it is, which comes from\r\nPrecius, I do not want mixed up with the accounts of mine of which that\r\nfellow has the handling. I have written to Terentia and to Philotimus\r\nhimself that I shall deposit with you any moneys I may collect, for\r\nthe equipment of the triumph I anticipate. So I fancy there will be no\r\n_amour propre_ wounded: but as they like. Here is another matter for\r\nyour consideration--the steps I am to take to arrange this business.\r\nYou outlined them in a letter dated from Epirus or Athens, and I will\r\nsupport your plan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 12\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nCICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr.

Your health causes me great anxiety; for I see from your letter\r\nthat you really suffer. But, knowing your spirit, I strongly suspect\r\nthere is something serious which compels you to give in and nearly\r\ncauses a breakdown, although your Pamphilus tells me that one fit of\r\nquartan has passed, and that a second and lighter attack is coming\r\non. But Terentia (who reached Brundisium's gates as I reached the\r\nharbour, and met me in the forum) told me that L. Pontius had informed\r\nher at Trebula that the second attack also had abated. If that is so,\r\nmy utmost hopes are realized, and I expect that consummation has been\r\nattained by your caution and moderate habits.\r\n\r\n[10] Catullus, Cinna, and the other imitators of Alexandrine poetry.\r\n\r\nI come to your letters, which have reached me in shoals, each more\r\ndelightful than the last--I mean those in your own handwriting. I like\r\nAlexis' hand; it so closely resembles your own script; but there is one\r\nthing I do not like about it--it shows that you are ill. Talking of\r\nAlexis, I left Tiro sick at Patrae; he is, as you know, a young man,\r\nand you may add, if you like, an honest fellow. Nothing\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 14\r\n\r\nprobum. Nihil vidi melius. Itaque careo aegre et, quamquam videbatur\r\nse non graviter habere, tamen sum sollicitus, maximamque spem habeo in\r\nM'. Curi diligentia, de qua ad me scripsit Tiro et multi nuntiarunt.\r\nCurius autem ipse sensit, quam tu velles se a me diligi, et eo sum\r\nadmodum delectatus. Et mehercule est, quam facile diligas, ἀυτόχθων\r\nin homine urbanitas. Eius testamentum deporto trium[11] Ciceronum\r\nsignis obsignatum cohortisque praetoriae. Fecit palam te ex libella,\r\nme ex terruncio. In Actio Corcyrae Alexio me opipare muneratus est. Q.\r\nCiceroni obsisti non potuit, quo minus Thyamim videret. Filiola tua\r\nte delectari laetor et probari tibi φυσικὴι esse τὴν πρὸς τὰ τέκνα.\r\nEtenim, si haec non est, nulla potest homini esse ad hominem naturae\r\nadiunctio; qua sublata vitae societas tollitur, \"Bene eveniat!\" inquit\r\nCarneades spurce, sed tamen prudentius quam Lucius noster et Patron,\r\nqui, cum omnia ad se referant, numquam quicquam alterius causa fieri\r\nputent et, cum ea re bonum virum oportere esse dicant, ne malum habeat,\r\nnon quo id natura rectum sit, non intellegant se de callido homine\r\nloqui, non de bono viro. Sed haec, opinor, sunt in iis libris, quos tu\r\nlaudando animos mihi addidisti.\r\n\r\n[11] detortorio _M_; detortorium _CZ_; _corr. by Junius_.\r\n\r\nRedeo ad rem.

So I miss him terribly, and, though he did\r\nnot seem very bad, still I am anxious, and build great hopes on the\r\ncare of M'. Curius, about which Tiro has written and many people have\r\ntold me. Curius himself was aware of your desire that he should win my\r\nesteem: and I am greatly charmed with him. Indeed he is one of nature's\r\ngentlemen, whom it is easy to like. I carry home his will sealed with\r\nthe seals of three of my family and of the praetor's staff. In the\r\npresence of witnesses he made you heir to a tenth of his estate and\r\nme to a fortieth.[12] At Actium in Corcyra Alexio made me a splendid\r\npresent. Q. Cicero could not be stopped from seeing the river Thyamis.\r\nI am glad you take delight in your baby daughter, and have satisfied\r\nyourself that a desire for children is natural.[13] For, if it is not,\r\nthere can be no natural tie between man and man; remove that tie,\r\nand social life is destroyed. \"Heaven bless the consequence,\" says\r\nCarneades naughtily, but with more wisdom than our philosophers Lucius\r\nand Patron, who in sticking to selfish hedonism and denying altruism,\r\nand saying that man must be virtuous for fear of the consequences of\r\nvice and not because virtue is an end in itself, fail to see that they\r\nare describing a type not of goodness but of craftiness. But these\r\npoints, I think, are handled in the volumes[14] you have encouraged me\r\nby praising.\r\n\r\n[12] Monetary fractions are generally expressed by parts of the _as_;\r\nbut here the _denarius_ is used as the standard. The _libella_ was\r\none-tenth and the _teruncius_ one-fortieth of a _denarius_.\r\n\r\n[13] With φυσικήν the substantive ὁρμήν must be understood.\r\n\r\n[14] _De Republica._\r\n\r\nI return to business. How I looked for the letter\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 16\r\n\r\nquam Philoxeno dedisses! Scripseras enim in ea esse de sermone Pompei\r\nNeapolitano. Eam mihi Patron Brundisi reddidit. Corcyrae, ut opinor,\r\nacceperat. Nihil potuit esse iucundius. Erat enim de re publica, de\r\nopinione, quam is vir haberet integritatis meae, de benevolentia,\r\nquam ostendit eo sermone, quem habuit de triumpho. Sed tamen hoc\r\niucundissimum, quod intellexi te ad eum venisse, ut eius animum erga me\r\nperspiceres. Hoc mihi, inquam, accidit iucundissimum. De triumpho autem\r\nnulla me cupiditas umquam tenuit ante Bibuli impudentissimas litteras,\r\nquas amplissume supplicatio consecuta est. A quo si ea gesta essent,\r\nquae scripsit, gauderem et honori faverem; nunc illum, qui pedem porta,\r\nquoad hostis cis Euphratem fuit, non extulerit, honore augeri, me, in\r\ncuius exercitu spem illius exercitus habuit, idem non adsequi, dedecus\r\nest nostrum, nostrum inquam te coniungens. Itaque omnia experiar, et ut\r\nspero, adsequar. Quodsi tu valeres, iam mihi quaedam explorata essent.\r\nSed, ut spero, valebis.\r\n\r\nDe raudusculo Numeriano multum te amo. Hortensius quid egerit, aveo\r\nscire, Cato quid agat; qui quidem in me turpiter fuit malevolus. Dedit\r\nintegritatis, iustitiae, clementiae, fidei mihi testimonium, quod non\r\nquaerebam; quod postulabam, negavit id. Itaque Caesar eis litteris,\r\nquibus mihi gratulatur et omnia pollicetur, quo modo exsultat Catonis\r\nin me ingratissmi iniuria! At hic idem Bibulo dierum XX.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 17\r\n\r\nyou said was entrusted to Philoxenus! For it was to contain news of\r\nPompey's talk at Naples. Patron handed it to me at Brundisium. It was\r\nat Corcyra, I fancy, he had taken charge of it. Nothing could be more\r\ndelightful. It touched on politics, the great man's opinion of my\r\nhonour, the kindliness he displayed in his remarks about my triumph.\r\nBut the most delightful item of all was the intelligence that you had\r\ncalled on him to find out his feeling towards me. This, I repeat, was\r\nwhat I found most delightful. As for a triumph, I had no desire for\r\none up to the time Bibulus sent his shameless despatches and got a\r\nthanksgiving voted in the most complimentary way. Now, if he had done\r\nwhat he professed to have done, I should have been glad and supported\r\nthe honour; but, as it is, it is a disgrace to us--to both of us: for\r\nI include you in the business--that I, on whose army his army relied,\r\nshould not get the same rewards as a man who never set foot outside\r\nthe city gates so long as there was an enemy this side of Euphrates.\r\nTherefore I shall make every effort, and, as I hope, shall succeed. If\r\nyou were well, some points would have been settled already; but I hope\r\nyou will soon be well.\r\n\r\nFor that twopenny debt to Numerius I am much bounden to you. I long to\r\nknow what Hortensius has done about my triumph and what Cato is doing.\r\nCato's behaviour to me was shamefully spiteful. He gave me a character\r\nfor rectitude, equity, clemency, and good faith, for which I did not\r\nask; what I did want, that he denied me. Accordingly in his letter of\r\ncongratulation and lavish assurances, how Caesar exults over the wrong\r\nCato did me by his deep ingratitude! Yet Cato voted Bibulus a twenty\r\ndays'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 18\r\n\r\nIgnosce mihi; non possum haec ferre nec feram.\r\n\r\nCupio ad omnes tuas epistulas, sed nihil necesse est; iam enim te\r\nvidebo. Illud tamen de Chrysippo--nam de altero illo minus sum\r\nadmiratus, operario homine; sed tamen ne illo quidem quicquam\r\nimprobius. Chrysippum vero, quem ego propter litterularum nescio quid\r\nlibenter vidi, in honore habui, discedere a puero insciente me! Mitto\r\nalia, quae audio multa, mitto furta; fugam non fero, qua mihi nihil\r\nvisum est sceleratius. Itaque usurpavi vetus illud Drusi, ut ferunt,\r\npraetoris, in eo, qui eadem liber non iuraret, me istos liberos non\r\naddixisse, praesertim cum adesset nemo, a quo recte vindicarentur. Id\r\ntu, ut videbitur, ita accipies; ego tibi adsentiar.\r\n\r\nUni tuae disertissimae epistulae non rescripsi, in qua est de periculis\r\nrei publicae. Quid rescriberem? valde eram perturbatus. Sed ut nihil\r\nmagno opere metuam, Parthi faciunt, qui repente Bibulum semivivum\r\nreliquerunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nCICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr. in Trebulano V Id.

Forgive me, I cannot and I will not bear it.\r\n\r\nI long to answer all your letters; but there is no need, for soon I\r\nshall see you. Still I must tell you about Chrysippus--the conduct of\r\nthat other fellow, a mere mechanic, excites my surprise less, though\r\nit could not have been more scandalous. But Chrysippus, whom I was\r\nalways glad to see and held in honour, because he had a smattering of\r\nculture, fancy him deserting my son without my knowledge! I can put\r\nup with other things, though I hear of plenty, I can even put up with\r\nembezzlement; but I cannot put up with his flight. It is the most\r\nscandalous thing I ever heard of. So I have taken a leaf from Drusus'\r\nbook, when, in his praetorship, as the story goes, a man, who had been\r\nmanumitted, refused to take the oaths he had promised: and I have\r\ndenied that those fellows ever were freed by me, especially as there\r\nwere no legal witnesses to the transaction. Take it any way you will: I\r\nwill abide by your decision.\r\n\r\nThe only one of your letters, which I have not answered, is the most\r\neloquent of them all, dealing with the country's peril. I have no\r\nanswer to make: I am very much upset. But the Parthians, whose sudden\r\nretreat left Bibulus half dead with fright, have taught me not to be\r\nmuch alarmed at anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nCICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Trebula, Dec. 9_, B.C. _50_]\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of December I came to Aeculanum, and there I read your\r\nletter, which Philotimus handed to me. I was pleased at the first\r\nglance to see it was\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 20\r\n\r\nerant a te ipso scriptae, deinde earum accuratissuma diligentia sum\r\nmirum in modum delectatus. Ac primum illud, in quo te Dicaearcho\r\nadsentiri negas, etsi cupidissume expetitum a me est et te approbante,\r\nne diutius anno in provincia essem, tamen non est nostra contentione\r\nperfectum. Sic enim scito, verbum in senatu factum esse numquam de ullo\r\nnostrum, qui provincias obtinuimus, quo in iis diutius quam ex senatus\r\nconsulto maneremus, ut iam ne istius quidem rei culpam sustineam, quod\r\nminus diu fuerim in provincia, quam fortasse fuerit utile. Sed \"quid\r\nsi hoc melius?\" opportune dici videtur ut in hoc ipso. Sive enim ad\r\nconcordiam res adduci potest sive ad bonorum victoriam, utriusvis rei\r\nme aut adiutorem velim esse aut certe non expertem; sin vincuntur\r\nboni, ubicumque essem, una cum iis victus essem. Quare celeritas\r\nnostri reditus ἀμεταμέλητος debet esse. Quodsi ista nobis cogitatio de\r\ntriumpho iniecta non esset, quam tu quoque adprobas, ne tu haud multum\r\nrequireres illum virum, qui in sexto libro informatus est. Quid enim\r\ntibi faciam, qui illos libros devorasti? Quin nunc ipsum non dubitabo\r\nrem tantam abicere, si id erit rectius. Utrumque vero simul agi non\r\npotest, et de triumpho ambitiose et de re publica libere. Sed ne\r\ndubitaris, quin, quod honestius, id mihi futurum sit antiquius. Nam,\r\nquod putas utilius esse, vel mihi quod tutius sit, vel etiam ut rei\r\npublicae prodesse possim, me esse cum imperio, id coram considerabimus\r\nquale sit. Habet enim res deliberationem; etsi ex parte magna\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 21\r\n\r\nin your handwriting; and I was highly delighted at the care\r\nand attention it showed. First you say that you disagree with\r\nDicaearchus.[15] Now, though I was exceedingly anxious, and that with\r\nyour approval, not to stay in my province more than a year, it was\r\nnot my own efforts that gained the point. For you should know that no\r\nword was ever said in the House about any of us provincial governors\r\noutstaying the term of our appointment; so that now I am not to be\r\nblamed even for making a shorter stay in my province than was perhaps\r\nto my advantage. But \"all for the best\" is an apt saying, as it is in\r\nthis case. For, if peace can be patched up, or the loyalists can be\r\nmade to win the victory, I should be sorry not to assist or at any\r\nrate have a hand in the matter. But, if the loyalists are conquered, I\r\nshould share their defeat wherever I were. So my speedy return ought\r\nnot to cost me any regret. If this idea of a triumph that you approve\r\nhad not come into my head, you would find me not far short of the ideal\r\nstatesman I sketched in the sixth volume.[16] What would you have me\r\ndo, you devourer of those books of mine? Even now I will not hesitate\r\nto throw away my great ambition, if that course is better. One cannot\r\nof course play both parts at once, the selfish candidate for triumph\r\nand the independent politician. But doubt not that I shall take honesty\r\nto be my best policy. As for your point that it were better for me,\r\nwhether for my private safety, or for the public welfare, that I should\r\nretain my command, we will talk it over together. It is a matter for\r\ndeliberation,\r\n\r\n[15] Cf. II, 16, where Dicaearchus is mentioned as an advocate of an\r\nactive life. He was a pupil of Aristotle, and wrote philosophical and\r\ngeographical works.\r\n\r\n[16] Of the _De Republica_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 22\r\n\r\ntibi adsentior. De animo autem meo erga rem publicam bene facis quod\r\nnon dubitas, et illud probe indicas, nequaquam satis pro meis officiis,\r\npro ipsius in alios effusione illum in me liberalem fuisse, eiusque\r\nrei causam vere explicas, et eis, quae de Fabio Caninioque acta\r\nscribis, valde consentiunt. Quae si secus essent, totumque se ille in\r\nme profudisset, tamen illa, quam scribis, custos urbis me praeclarae\r\ninscriptionis memorem esse cogeret, nec mihi concederet, ut imitarer\r\nVolcacium aut Servium, quibus tu es contentus, sed aliquid nos vellet\r\nnobis dignum et sentire et defendere. Quod quidem agerem, si liceret,\r\nalio modo, ac nunc agendum est.\r\n\r\nDe sua potentia dimicant homines hoc tempore periculo civitatis. Nam,\r\nsi res publica defenditur, cur ea consule isto ipso defensa non est?\r\ncur ego, in cuius causa rei publicae salus consistebat, defensus\r\npostero anno non sum? cur imperium illi aut cur illo modo prorogatum\r\nest? cur tanto opere pugnatum est, ut de eius absentis ratione habenda\r\ndecem tribuni pl. ferrent?

You do well not to doubt my\r\nattitude towards politics: and you judge rightly that Caesar has\r\nnot been liberal to me considering my services, and considering his\r\nlavishness towards others. You explain his reasons rightly: I am in the\r\nsame boat with Fabius and Caninius,[17] as your letter shows. But if\r\nthings were otherwise and he had been profuse in his generosity towards\r\nme, nevertheless the goddess you mention, the guardian of the city,\r\nwould have compelled me to remember her fine inscription, and would\r\nnot allow me to imitate Volcacius or Servius,[18] with whom you are\r\ncontent, but would wish me to express and maintain a policy worthy of\r\nmy name. And I should have done it, if I could, in a different way from\r\nthe way I must adopt now.\r\n\r\n[17] _Legati_ of Caesar: but nothing is known of any slight on them.\r\n\r\n[18] Before his exile Cicero dedicated a statue of Minerva in the\r\nCapitol with the inscription _Custos Urbis_. Possibly, however, there\r\nwas a longer inscription. Volcacius and Servius maintained neutrality\r\nin the civil war.\r\n\r\nIt is for their own power men are fighting now to the danger of the\r\ncountry. For if the constitution is being defended, why was it not\r\ndefended when Caesar himself was consul? Why was I, on whose case the\r\nsafety of the constitution depended, not defended in the following\r\nyear? Why was Caesar's command prolonged, or why was it prolonged in\r\nsuch a fashion? Why was there such a struggle to get the ten tribunes\r\nto bring in a bill allowing him to stand in his absence? All this has\r\nmade him so strong that now hope of resistance depends on one citizen.\r\nI wish that citizen had not given him so much power rather than that he\r\nnow resisted him in the hour of\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 24\r\n\r\nSed, quoniam res eo deducta est, non quaeram, ut scribis:\r\n\r\n                      Ποῦ σκάφος τὸ τῶν Ἀτρειδῶν;\r\n\r\nmihi σκάφος unum erit, quod a Pompeio gubernabitur. Illud ipsum quod\r\nais: \"Quid fiet, cum erit dictum: DIC, M. TVLLI?\"--σύντομα: \"CN. POMPEIO\r\nADSENTIOR.\" Ipsum tamen Pompeium separatim ad concordiam hortabor.\r\nSic enim sentio, maxumo in periculo rem esse. Vos scilicet plura,\r\nqui in urbe estis. Verum tamen haec video, cum homine audacissimo\r\nparatissimoque negotium esse, omnes damnatos omnes ignominia adfectos,\r\nomnes damnatione ignominiaque dignos illac facere, omnem fere\r\niuventutem omnem illam urbanam ac perditam plebem, tribunos valentes\r\naddito C. Cassio, omnes, qui aere alieno premantur, quos pluris esse\r\nintellego, quam putaram (causam solum ilia causa non habet, ceteris\r\nrebus abundat), hic omnia facere omnes, ne armis decernatur; quorum\r\nexitus semper incerti, nunc vero etiam in alteram partem magis timendi.\r\n\r\nBibulus de provincia decessit, Veientonem praefecit; in decedendo erit,\r\nut audio, tardior. Quem cum ornavit Cato, declaravit iis se solis non\r\ninvidere, quibus nihil aut non multum ad dignitatem posset accedere.\r\n\r\nNunc venio ad privata; fere enim respondi tuis litteris de re publica,\r\net iis, quas in suburbano, et iis, quas postea scripsisti.

But since things have come to such a pass, I shall not\r\nask, to borrow your quotation,\r\n\r\n\"Where is the bark of Atreus' sons?\"[19]\r\n\r\n[19] Euripides _Troades_ 455 ποῦ σκάφος τὸ τοῦ στρατηγοῦ\r\n\r\nMy only bark will be that which has Pompey for a pilot. For your\r\nquery \"What will happen when the question is put 'Your vote, Marcus\r\nTullius'\"--briefly \"I vote with Pompey.\" Still I shall exhort Pompey\r\nprivately to pacific measures. I feel that there is the greatest\r\ndanger. You, who are in town, will know more. Yet I see that we have\r\nto do with a man of the greatest daring and readiness, who has on his\r\nside all the criminal and social outcasts, and all who deserve to be\r\ncounted criminals and outcasts; nearly all the younger generation; all\r\nthe lowest city rabble; the powerful tribunes including C. Cassius; all\r\nthe insolvent, who are more in number than I imagined. All his cause\r\nwants is a good cause: it has everything else in plenty. On our side we\r\nall do everything to avoid battle. You can never be sure of the issue\r\nof war, and it is to be feared it would go against us now.\r\n\r\nBibulus has quitted the province and left Veiento in charge: he will be\r\npretty slow, I hear, on his journey. This is the man in whose praise\r\nCato spoke, when he declared that the only people he did not envy were\r\nthose who could not be raised higher or not much higher.\r\n\r\nTo come to private matters: for I have fairly answered your letter on\r\nthe political situation, both the one you wrote in your town villa and\r\nthe one you wrote later. Now for private matters. But one word about\r\nCaelius. So far is he from affecting my\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 26\r\n\r\nmoveat, ut valde ego ipsi, quod de sua sententia decesserit;\r\npaenitendum putem. Sed quid est, quod et vici Luccei sint addicti? Hoc\r\nte praetermisisse miror. De Philotimo faciam equidem, ut mones. Sed\r\nego mihi ab illo non rationes exspectabam, quas tibi edidit, verum\r\nid reliquum, quod ipse in Tusculano me referre in commentarium mea\r\nmanu voluit, quodque idem in Asia mihi sua manu scriptum dedit. Id si\r\npraestaret, quantum mihi aeris alieni esse tibi edidit, tantum et plus\r\netiam mihi ipse deberet. Sed in hoc genere, si modo per rem publicam\r\nlicebit, non accusabimur posthac, neque hercule antea neglegentes\r\nfuimus, sed amicorum multitudine occupati. Ergo utemur, ut polliceris,\r\net opera et consilio tuo nec tibi erimus, ut spero, in eo molesti.\r\nDe serperastris cohortis meae nihil est quod doleas. Ipsi enim se\r\ncollegerunt admiratione integritatis meae. Sed me moverat nemo magis\r\nquam is, quem tu neminem putas. Idem et initio fuerat et nunc est\r\negregius. Sed in ipsa decessione significavit sperasse se aliquid et\r\nid, quod animum induxerat paulisper, non tenuit, sed cito ad se rediit,\r\nmeisque honorificentissimis erga se officiis victus pluris ea duxit\r\nquam omnem pecuniam.\r\n\r\nEgo a Curio tabulas accepi, quas mecum porto. Hortensi legata cognovi.\r\nNunc aveo scire, quid hominis sit et quarum rerum auctionem instituat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 27\r\n\r\nview, that I think he must be sorry he changed his own. But what is\r\nthis story of Lucceius' property being knocked down to him? I wonder\r\nyou passed that over. As for Philotimus I shall take your advice. But\r\nI was not expecting from him the accounts, which he gave you: I was\r\nexpecting the balance, which he wished me to enter in my note-book with\r\nmy own hand at Tusculum, and for which he gave me in Asia a certificate\r\nin his own hand. If he should pay up all the money he told you was\r\nowing to me, he would still owe me as much again and even more. But,\r\nif only politics will allow, I shall not incur blame hereafter in\r\nmatters of this kind. Indeed I have not been careless hitherto; but my\r\ntime has been taken up by a crowd of friends. I shall therefore have\r\nyour industry and advice, as you promise, and I hope I shall not be\r\ntroublesome in the matter. You have no reason to lament the treatment\r\nthat I meted to my crooked staff.[20] They pulled themselves together\r\nin amaze at my honesty. But nobody surprised me more than the man whom\r\nyou think a nobody. From first to last he was and is splendid. But just\r\nat my departure he showed me that he had hoped for some reward; and\r\nyet he did not long cling to the idea which had entered his mind, but\r\nquickly came to himself again, and overwhelmed by the honours I had\r\ndone him, regarded them as of more worth than any money.\r\n\r\n[20] Lit. \"about the knee-splints (I gave) my staff.\" He refers to\r\nrestraining their rapacity.\r\n\r\nI have received his will from Curius and bring it with me. I know the\r\nlegacies Hortensius has to pay. Now I want to know the metal of the\r\nman, and what properties he is putting up for sale.

After all Dionysius and Nicias of\r\nCos, who is with me, do not consider that the Piraeus is a town. I will\r\nlook into the question. If I have made a mistake, it is in speaking of\r\nit not as a town but as a place, and I have authority. I do not depend\r\non a quotation from Caecilius: \"_Máne ut ex portu in Piraeum_,\"[23] as\r\nhe is a poor authority in Latinity; but I will quote Terence, whose\r\nfine style caused his plays to be ascribed to C. Laelius \"_Heri áliquot\r\nadulescéntuli coíimus in Piraeum_,\" and again: \"_Mercátor hoc addébat,\r\ncaptam e Súnio_.\"[24] If we want to call parishes towns, Sunium is as\r\nmuch a town as the Piraeus. But, since you are a purist, you will save\r\nme a lot of trouble, if you can solve the problem for me.\r\n\r\n[23] In the morning as I disembarked in the Piraeus.\r\n\r\n[24] Terence, _Eun._ 539 (yesterday while some of us youths met in the\r\nPiraeus), and 115 (The merchant added one thing more, a female slave\r\nfrom Sunium).

Balbus does the same on his account.\r\nCertainly I shall not swerve a finger's breadth from the strictest\r\nhonour; but you know how much I still owe him. Don't you think there is\r\nfear that this may be cast in my teeth, if I am slack; and repayment\r\ndemanded from me, if I am energetic?

In short, promises could go no further. As to the political\r\nsituation, he hinted certain war, without hope of agreement. It\r\nappeared that, though he had long understood there was a split between\r\nhimself and Caesar, he had had very recent proof of it. Hirtius, a\r\nvery intimate friend of Caesar's, had come and had not called on\r\nPompey. Besides Hirtius had arrived on the evening of the 6th of\r\nDecember and Balbus had arranged a meeting with Pompey's father-in-law\r\nbefore daybreak on the 7th to discuss affairs, when, lo, late on the\r\nnight before, Hirtius set out to go to Caesar. This seemed to Pompey\r\nproof positive of a split. In a word I have no consolation except the\r\nthought, that, when even his enemies have renewed his term of office\r\nand fortune has bestowed on him supreme power, Caesar will not be so\r\nmad as to jeopardize these advantages. If he begins to run amuck, my\r\nfears are more than I can commit to paper. As things are, I meditate a\r\nvisit to town on the 3rd of January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nCICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Formiae Dec. 16_, B.C. _50_]\r\n\r\nA number of your letters have reached me at the same time: and,\r\nalthough visitors bring me later news, they are delightful, as they\r\nshow your affection and good will.

Quem quidem ego, etsi mirabilis utilitates\r\nmihi praebet, cum valet, in onmi genere vel negotiorum vel studiorum\r\nmeorum, tamen propter humanitatem et modestiam malo salvum quam propter\r\nusum meum. Philogenes mecum nihil umquam de Luscenio locatus est; de\r\nceteris rebus habes Dionysium. Sororem tuam non venisse in Arcanum\r\nmiror. De Chrysippo meum consilium probari tibi non moleste fero. Ego\r\nin Tusculanum nihil sane hoc tempore; devium est τοῖς ἀπαντῶσιν et\r\nhabet alia δύσχρεστα. Sed de Formiano Tarracinam pridie Kal. Ian. Inde\r\nPomptinam summam, inde in Albanum Pompei. Ita ad urbem III Nonas natali\r\nmeo.\r\n\r\nDe re publica cotidie magis timeo. Non enim boni, ut putant,\r\nconsentiunt. Quos ego equites Romanos, quos senatores vidi, qui\r\nacerrime cum cetera tum hoc iter Pompei vituperarent! Pace opus est.\r\nEx victoria cum multa mala tum certe tyrannus exsistet. Sed haec prope\r\ndiem coram.

Both of you do your best to get well. As for Tiro I see\r\nyou are attending to him. Though when in health, he is marvellously\r\nuseful to me in every department of business and literature, it is not\r\na selfish motive, but his own charming character and modest bearing\r\nthat prompts my hope for his recovery. Philogenes has never said\r\nanything to me about Luscenius. As for other matters Dionysius is with\r\nyou. I am astonished your sister has not come to Arcanum. I am glad you\r\napprove my plan about Chrysippus. I shall not go to Tusculum at such a\r\ntime as this, not I. It is out of the way for chance _rencontres_ and\r\nhas other drawbacks. But from Formiae I go to Tarracina on the last\r\nof December. Thence to the upper end of the Pomptine marsh: thence to\r\nPompey's Alban villa: and so to Rome on the 3rd, my birthday.\r\n\r\nThe political crisis is causing me greater fear every day. The\r\nloyalists are not, as is imagined, in agreement. I have met numbers\r\nof Roman knights, and numbers of Members, ready to inveigh bitterly\r\nagainst everything and especially this journey of Pompey's. Peace is\r\nour want. Victory will bring many evils, and without doubt a tyrant.\r\nBut this we shall soon discuss together.

You do not add \"and he expressed his\r\ngratitude to you.\" Yet certainly he ought to have done so, and, if he\r\nhad, you would have added it with your usual good nature. I cannot make\r\na _volte face_ about him, owing to the character I gave him in the\r\nformer letter. Let us call him then an honest fellow. He has done me\r\none kindness at any rate in giving me this further chance to know him\r\nthoroughly. Philogenes is correct in what he wrote: he duly settled\r\nhis debt. I wanted him to use the money as long as he could; so he has\r\nused it for 14 months. I hope Pomptinus is getting well. You mention\r\nhis entrance into town.

As the 2nd\r\nof January is a holiday, I don't wish to reach Pompey's Alban villa on\r\nthat date for fear I should be a nuisance to his household.

I forget on what\r\nday the fever will attack you again; but I would not have you stir to\r\nthe damage of your health.\r\n\r\nAs for my triumph, unless Caesar has been secretly intriguing through\r\nhis tribune partisans, all else seems smooth and easy. My mind is\r\nabsolutely at ease, and I regard the whole business with indifference,\r\nespecially as many people tell me that Pompey and his advisers\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 40\r\n\r\nme mittere, quod imperium habeam. Id est Ἀβδηριτικόν. Nec enim senatus\r\ndecrevit, nec populus iussit me imperium in Sicilia habere. Sin hoc\r\nres publica ad Pompeium refert, qui me magis quam privatum aliquem\r\nmittat? Itaque, si hoc imperium mihi molestum erit, utar ea porta, quam\r\nprimam videro. Nam, quod scribis mirificam exspectationem esse mei\r\nneque tamen quemquam bonorum aut satis bonorum dubitare, quid facturus\r\nsim, ego, quos tu bonos esse dicas, non intellego.

Quid ergo? exercitum retinentis, cum legis dies\r\ntransierit, rationem haberi placet? Mihi vero ne absentis quidem; sed,\r\ncum id datum est, illud una datum est.

That is a muddle-headed plan.[30] For neither has the House\r\ndecreed, nor the people authorized me to have military power in Sicily.\r\nIf the state delegates the appointment to Pompey, why should he send\r\nme rather than any unofficial person? So, if this military power is\r\ngoing to be a nuisance, I shall get rid of it by entering the first\r\ncity gate I see. As for your news that there is a wonderful interest\r\nin my arrival and that none of the \"right or right enough party\"\r\ndoubt as to my future action, I don't understand your phrase \"the\r\nright party.\" I don't know of such a party, that is if we look for a\r\nclass; of course there are individuals. But in political splits it is\r\nclasses and parties we want. Do you think the Senate is \"right,\" when\r\nit has left our provinces without military rule? For Curio could never\r\nhave held out, if there had been negotiations with him--a proposal\r\nrejected by the House, which left Caesar without a successor. Is\r\nit the tax-collectors, who have never been loyal and are now very\r\nfriendly with Caesar? Or is it the financiers or the farmers, whose\r\nchief desire is peace? Do you suppose they will fear a king, when they\r\nnever declined one so long as they were left in peace? Well then, do\r\nI approve of the candidature of a man who keeps his army beyond the\r\nlegal term? No, not even of his candidature in absence. But when the\r\none privilege was granted, the other went with it. Do I then approve of\r\nthe extension of his military power for ten years, and that carried as\r\nit was carried? Then I should have to approve of my own banishment, the\r\nthrowing away of the Campanian land on the people, the adoption\r\n\r\n[30] Abdera was the classical Gotham.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 42\r\n\r\nperisse et adoptatum patricium a plebeio, Gaditanum a Mytilenaeo, et\r\nLabieni divitiae et Mamurrae placent et Balbi horti et Tusculanum.

But the\r\nsource of all these evils is one. We ought to have resisted him when\r\nhe was weak: that would have been easy. Now there are eleven legions,\r\ncavalry as much as he wants, the northern tribes across the Po, the\r\ncity riff-raff, all the tribunes of the people, the young profligates,\r\na leader of such influence and daring. We must either fight him or\r\nallow his candidature according to the law. \"Fight,\" say you, \"rather\r\nthan be slaves.\" The result will be proscription if beaten and slavery\r\neven if one wins. \"What shall I do then?\" What the cattle do, who when\r\nscattered follow flocks of their own kind. As an ox follows the herd,\r\nso shall I follow the \"right party,\" or whoever are said to be the\r\n\"right party,\" even if they rush to destruction. The best course in our\r\nstraits is clear to me. No one can tell the issue of war: but every one\r\ncan tell that, if the right party are beaten, Caesar will not be more\r\nmerciful than Cinna in slaying the nobility, nor more moderate than\r\nSulla in robbing the rich. I have discussed _la haute politique_ long\r\nenough, and I would do so longer, had not my lamp gone out.

Pompey's comment\r\nwas \"What do you suppose Caesar will do, if he becomes master of the\r\nstate, when a wretched, insignificant subordinate dares to talk in\r\nthis strain?\" In a word, he appeared not only not to seek peace, but\r\neven to fear it. But I fancy the idea of leaving the city shakes his\r\nresolution. What annoys me most is that I have to pay up to Caesar, and\r\ndevote to the purpose what I should have used for my triumph.

Or\r\nwe may have to persuade him to take office on condition of giving up\r\nhis province and his troops. Or, if he will not yield to persuasion on\r\nthat point, we may refuse to admit him as a candidate at the election,\r\nand he may endure the treatment and keep his province. Or, if he\r\nemploys the tribunes to interfere, yet keeps the peace, a political\r\ndeadlock may be brought about. Or, if he uses force, because we reject\r\nhim as a candidate, we may have to fight and he may begin at once\r\nbefore we are ready, or when his friends fail to get his candidature\r\nallowed at the elections in accordance with his legal privilege. He may\r\nresort to arms solely on account of his rejection as a candidate, or\r\nfor a further reason, if a tribune through using obstructionist tactics\r\nor an appeal to popular feeling incur a censure or a limitation of\r\npower or suspension or expulsion from office, or if some tribune fly to\r\nhim with a tale of expulsion. War begun, we must either hold the city\r\nor abandon it and cut him off from food and supplies. Of these evils\r\nsome one must be borne: consider which in your opinion is the lightest.\r\nOf course you will say, \"Induce him to give up his army and so take\r\nthe consulship.\" True there can be no objection to that, if he will\r\ncondescend, and I wonder he does not, if he cannot get his candidature\r\nsupported\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 50\r\n\r\nfacere miror. Nobis autem, ut quidam putant, nihil est timendum magis\r\nquam ille consul. \"At sic malo,\" inquies, \"quam cum exercitu.\" Certe;\r\nsed istud ipsum \"sic\" magnum malum putat aliquis, neque ei remedium est\r\nullum. \"Cedendum est, si id volet.\" Vide consulem illum iterum, quem\r\nvidisti consulatu priore. \"At tum imbecillus plus,\" inquis, \"valuit\r\nquam tota res publica.\" Quid nunc putas? et eo consule Pompeio certum\r\nest esse in Hispania. O rem miseram! si quidem id ipsum deterrimum\r\nest, quod recusari non potest, et quod ille si faciat, iam iam a bonis\r\nomnibus summam ineat gratiam. Tollamus igitur hoc, quo illum posse\r\nadduci negant; de reliquis quid est deterrimum? Concedere illi, quod,\r\nut idem dicit, impudentissime postulat. Nam quid impudentius? Tenuisti\r\nprovinciam per annos decem, non tibi a senatu, sed a te ipso per vim et\r\nper factionem datos; praeteriit tempus non legis, sed libidinis tuae,\r\nfac tamen legis; ut succedatur, decernitur; impedis et ais: \"Habe meam\r\nrationem.\" Habe tu nostram. Exercitum tu habeas diutius, quam populus\r\niussit, invito senatu? \"Depugnes oportet, nisi concedis.\" Cum bona\r\nquidem spe, ut ait idem, vel vincendi vel in libertate moriendi. Iam,\r\nsi pugnandum est, quo tempore, in casu, quo consilio, in temporibus\r\nsitum est. Itaque te in ea quaestione non exerceo; ad ea, quae dixi,\r\nadfer, si quid habes. Equidem dies noctesque torqueor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 51\r\n\r\nwhile he keeps his army. But for us some think that nothing could be\r\nworse than Caesar in office. You may say, \"Better so, than with an\r\narmy.\" Certainly: but Pompey thinks that very \"so\" fatal, and there is\r\nno remedy for it. \"We must submit to Caesar's will.\" But imagine him\r\nin office again after your experience of his former tenure. You will\r\nreflect that, weak as he was, he was too strong for the constitution.\r\nWhat about him now? And now, if Caesar is consul, Pompey will remain in\r\nSpain. What a plight! since the worst of all is the very alternative\r\nwhich we cannot refuse him, and the one which, if he takes it, will of\r\nitself win him the favour of the right party. This course it is said\r\nhe will not accept; let us put it out of court. Which is the worst\r\nof the remaining alternatives? To concede his impertinent demand, as\r\nPompey terms it? Impertinent it is indeed. You have had a province for\r\nten years, not allotted by the Senate, but by yourself through force\r\nand insubordination. This term, not a legal term, but a term of your\r\nown will and pleasure--or say, this legal term--comes to an end. The\r\nHouse passes a decree for the appointment of a successor. You object\r\nand cry, \"Consider my candidature.\" Consider our case. Are you to dare\r\nthe House and keep your army longer than the nation sanctions? \"You\r\nmust fight or yield.\" Then as Pompey says, let us hope for victory,\r\nor death with freedom. If we must fight, the time depends on chance,\r\nthe plan of campaign on circumstances. So I do not trouble you on that\r\npoint. But make any suggestion you can on my remarks.

If he remains in Italy,\r\nI fear it is impossible for him to have a reliable army. If he leaves\r\nItaly, where he will go or stay, and what we are to do I don't know.\r\nFor I imagine that Caesar, whom you fear may be a Phalaris, will stick\r\nat no abominations. He will not be deterred by adjournment of public\r\nbusiness, the departure of members and magistrates and the closure of\r\nthe treasury. But, as you say, we shall know soon.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile forgive me for writing so much and so often; it soothes\r\nme, and I wish to extract letters from you, and especially advice as\r\nto where to go and what to do. Shall I give myself up heart and soul\r\nto the good cause? I am not terrified by the danger, but tortured\r\nby the anguish. To think that everything has been done with such a\r\nlack of plan, or so contrary to my plan! Or shall I hesitate and play\r\nthe turncoat, and join the party that holds the field? \"I fear the\r\nTrojans,\" and I am held back not only by my duty as a citizen, but by\r\nmy duty as a friend; though I am often shaken by pity for the boys. So\r\nwrite a line to me in my distress, although you have the same worries;\r\nand especially as to what you think I should do, if Pompey leaves\r\nItaly. I have met M'. Lepidus and he draws the line there; so does L.\r\nTorquatus. There are many obstacles before me, including my lictors.\r\nI have never seen such an intricate tangle. So I do not look to you\r\nfor positive advice: but only for your opinion. In fact I want to know\r\nhow the dilemma presents itself to you.

Sed velim consideres, quid\r\nfaciendum putes primum πρὸς τὸ ἀσφαλές (aliter enim mihi de illis ac\r\nde me ipso consulendum est), deinde ad opiniones, ne reprehendamur,\r\nquod eas Romae velimus esse in communi bonorum fuga.

What he will do, and how he will do\r\nit, in the absence of House and magistrates, I do not know. He will be\r\nunable even to pretend constitutional methods. But where can our party\r\nraise its head or when? You, too, remark how poor a soldier our leader\r\nis; why, he did not even know how things were in Picenum; and the\r\ncrisis shows his lack of policy. Pass over other faults of the last ten\r\nyears. What compromise were not better than this flight? I do not know\r\nwhat he is thinking of doing now, though I inquire by constant letters.\r\nIt is agreed that his alarm and confusion has reached the limit. He\r\nwas kept in Italy to garrison Rome, but no garrison or place to post a\r\ngarrison can I see. We depend entirely on two legions that were kept\r\nhere by a trick, and are practically disloyal. For so far the levy has\r\nfound unwilling recruits, afraid of war. But the time of compromise is\r\npassed. The future is obscure. We, or our leader, have brought things\r\nto such a pass, that having put to sea without a rudder, we must trust\r\nto the mercy of the storm.\r\n\r\nSo I hesitate what to do with the boys. Sometimes I think of sending\r\nthem to Greece. As for Tullia and Terentia, when I picture the approach\r\nof the barbarians on Rome, I am terrified. But the thought of Dolabella\r\nis some small relief to my mind. Please consider my best course, in\r\nthe first place with an eye to safety, for their safety stands on a\r\ndifferent footing to mine, and then with regard to possible criticism,\r\nif I leave them in Rome, when the loyal are all in flight. Even you and\r\nPeducaeus must be careful what you do, as he writes to me.

His conditions were accepted with the\r\nreservation that he should withdraw his garrison from the towns he\r\nhas occupied outside his own province. That done, they said, we would\r\nreturn to Rome and settle business in the House.

Ita, quod maxime opus\r\nest, in Siciliam ire non curat; quod metuo ne obsit, in senatu esse\r\nvult. Postumius autem, de quo nominatim senatus decrevit, ut statim\r\nin Siciliam iret Furfanioque succederet, negat se sine Catone iturum\r\net suam in senatu operam auctoritatemque quam magni aestimat. Ita\r\nres ad Fannium pervenit. Is cum imperio in Siciliam praemittitur. In\r\ndisputationibus nostris summa varietas est.

When we\r\ncannot talk face to face, there is nothing I like better.\r\n\r\nI reached Capua yesterday, the 25th, where I met the consuls and many\r\nfellow-members. All hope that Caesar will abide by his conditions,\r\naccepting the withdrawal of his garrisons: only Favonius objects to\r\nhis dictating to us. But no one listened to him. For even Cato now\r\nprefers slavery to war: but he wants to be in the House when the terms\r\nare debated, if Caesar can be induced to withdraw his garrisons. So he\r\ndoes not care to do what would be most useful, and go to Sicily: and\r\nhe wants to be in the House, where I fear he will cause trouble. The\r\nSenate definitely decreed that Postumius should set out for Sicily at\r\nonce and succeed Furfanius. Postumius replied he would not go without\r\nCato; he has a great idea of his own value and influence in the House.\r\nSo choice fell on Fannius; he is dispatched to Sicily with military\r\npower. In our debates there is great difference of opinion. Most\r\ndeclare that Caesar will not stick to his compact, and that his demands\r\nwere only introduced to hinder our preparations for war. I fancy,\r\nhowever, that he will withdraw his garrisons. For he will win his\r\npoint, if he is elected consul, and win it with less scandal than by\r\nhis first course. But the blow must be borne. We are sinfully unready\r\nin men and money: for we have left him not only our private purses\r\nin the city, but the state funds in the treasury. Pompey along with\r\nLabienus has set out for Appius' legions. I want your views on this.

About Caesar's\r\nultimatum, the arrival of Labienus, and the reply of Pompey and the\r\nconsuls, I informed you in my letter of the 26th of January from Capua,\r\nand I threw in a deal of other information besides. Now we have two\r\nthings to wait for, first what Caesar will do on receipt of the terms\r\ngiven to L. Caesar to convey to him, and secondly what Pompey is doing\r\nnow. Pompey indeed writes to me that in a few days he will have a\r\nstrong force, and he encourages me to hope, that, if he enters Picenum,\r\nwe shall return to Rome. Labienus accompanies him, confident in the\r\nweakness of Caesar's forces. His arrival has much encouraged Pompey.\r\nThe consuls have ordered me to go to Capua by the 5th of February.\r\n\r\nI set out from Capua for Formiae on the 28th of January. On receipt of\r\nyour letter at Cales on that day about three o'clock I write this by\r\nreturn. As for Terentia and Tullia I agree with you, and I have written\r\nto them to consult you.

Nos enim Hispaniam peteremus;\r\nillis hoc aeque commodum non erat. Tu ipse cum Sexto etiam nunc mihi\r\nvideris Romae recte esse posse; etenim minime amici Pompeio nostro esse\r\ndebetis. Nemo enim umquam tantum de urbanis praediis detraxit. Videsne\r\nme etiam iocari?\r\n\r\nScire iam te oportet, L. Caesar quae response referat a Pompeio, quas\r\nab eodem ad Caesarem ferat litteras. Scriptae enim et datae ita sunt,\r\nut proponerentur in publico. In quo accusavi mecum ipse Pompeium, qui,\r\ncum scriptor luculentus esset, tantas res atque eas, quae in omnium\r\nmanus venturae essent, Sestio nostro scribendas dederit. Itaque nihil\r\numquam legi scriptum σηστιωδέστερον. Perspici tamen ex litteris Pompei\r\npotest nihil Caesari negari omniaque ei cumulate, quae postulet,\r\ndari. Quae ille amentissimus fuerit nisi acceperit, praesertim cum\r\nimpudentissime postulaverit. Quis enim tu es, qui dicas: \"Si in\r\nHispaniam profectus erit, si praesidia dimiserit\"? Tamen conceditur\r\nminus honeste nunc quidem violata iam ab illo re publica illatoque\r\nbello, quam si olim de ratione habenda impetrasset. Et tamen vereor,\r\nut his ipsis contentus sit.

For I myself should have gone to\r\nSpain, but it would not have been so suitable for them. I fancy you and\r\nSextus may well stay in Rome even now; for you are not in the least\r\nbound to be Pompey's friends: no one has ever depreciated city property\r\nso much as Pompey. I must have my joke still, you see.\r\n\r\nYou should know already the reply that Pompey is sending by Lucius\r\nCaesar, and the nature of his letter to Caesar; for it was written and\r\nsent on purpose to be published. Mentally I blamed Pompey who, though a\r\nclear writer himself, gave Sestius the task of drawing up documents of\r\nsuch importance, which were to come into every one's hands. Accordingly\r\nI have never seen anything more Sestian in its style.[43] Still it is\r\nplain from the letter that nothing can be denied to Caesar, and that\r\nthe whole bulk of his demands are to be granted. He will be utterly mad\r\nto reject the terms, particularly when his demands are most impudent.\r\nPray, who are you, Caesar, to insist \"Provided Pompey go to Spain,\r\nprovided he dismiss his garrisons\"? Still the demand is being granted,\r\nbut it has cost us more loss of dignity now that he has outraged the\r\nsanctity of the state and waged war against it, than if he had obtained\r\nhis previous request to be admitted a candidate. And yet I fear he may\r\nwant more. For when he entrusted his ultimatum to L. Caesar, he should\r\nhave kept a little quiet until he received a reply. But he is said now\r\nto be more energetic than ever.\r\n\r\n[43] Cf. Catullus xliv for comments on Sestius' style. Sestius was\r\ndefended by Cicero in 56 B.C. with a speech which is extant.\r\n\r\nTrebatius indeed writes to me that Caesar requested\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 76\r\n\r\nrogatum esse, ut scriberet ad me, ut essem ad urbem, nihil ei me\r\ngratius facere posse. Haec verbis plurimis. Intellexi ex dierum\r\nratione, ut primum de discessu nostro Caesar audisset, laborare eum\r\ncoepisse, ne omnes abessemus. Itaque non dubito, quin ad Pisonem, quin\r\nad Servium scripserit; illud admiror, non ipsum ad me scripsisse, non\r\nper Dolabellam, non per Caelium egisse. Quamquam non aspernor Trebati\r\nlitteras; a quo me unice diligi scio. Rescripsi ad Trebatium (nam ad\r\nipsum Caesarem, qui mihi nihil scripsisset, nolui), quam illud hoc\r\ntempore esset difficile; me tamen in praediis meis esse neque dilectum\r\nullum neque negotium suscepisse. In quo quidem manebo, dum spes\r\npacis erit; sin bellum geretur, non deero officio nec dignitati meae\r\npueros ὑπεκθέμενος in Graeciam. Totam enim Italiam flagraturam bello\r\nintellego.

All this at great length. I\r\ncalculated from the date, that as soon as he heard of my departure\r\nCaesar began to be concerned lest we should all go from town. So I have\r\nno doubt he wrote to Piso and to Servius. One thing surprises me that\r\nhe did not write to me himself, or approach me through Dolabella or\r\nCaelius. However, I am not offended at a letter from Trebatius, who is\r\nmy particular wellwisher. I would not reply to Caesar himself, as he\r\nhad not written to me; but I wrote to Trebatius how difficult such a\r\ncourse would be at this juncture, but that I was staying on my country\r\nestates, and had not undertaken any part in the levy or any business.\r\nTo this I will stand so long as there is any prospect of peace; but, if\r\nit comes to war, I shall act as becomes my duty and rank, after stowing\r\naway my boys to Greece. For all Italy, I gather, will blaze with war.\r\nSuch a catastrophe is caused partly by disloyalty, partly by jealousy\r\namongst her citizens. The outcome will be known in a few days from\r\nCaesar's answer to our letter. Then, if it be war, I will write again:\r\nif it be peace or a respite, I shall hope to see you.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of February, the date of this letter, I await my women-folk\r\nin my place at Formiae, whence I have returned from Capua. I wrote to\r\nthem on your advice to stay in Rome. But I hear that panic has rather\r\nincreased there. I want to be at Capua on the 5th of February, as the\r\nconsuls have ordered.

I and my brother\r\nstart for Capua on the 3rd of February, the date of this letter, to\r\nmeet the consuls on the 5th according to their instructions.\r\n\r\nPompey's reply to Caesar is said to please the people, and to have won\r\nthe approval of a public meeting. I expected it. If Caesar rejects\r\nthis condition, he will fall in esteem: if he accept----. You will\r\nask my choice in the matter. I would answer, if I knew our state of\r\npreparation. It is reported here that Cassius has been driven from\r\nAncona, and that our party hold the town. That will be a useful thing\r\nin the event of war. As for Caesar, though he has sent L. Caesar\r\nwith negotiations for peace, nevertheless reports declare that he is\r\ncollecting levies with the greatest energy, seizing posts, and securing\r\nthe country with garrisons. What a villain robber! What a disgrace to\r\nthe country, too dear a price to pay for any peace! But let us restrain\r\nour anger, yield to circumstance and accompany Pompey to Spain. That\r\nis my choice in our straits, since we did not take the chance when we\r\nhad it of keeping him from his second consulship.[46] But enough of\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n[46] Or \"since we refused him his second consulship, when we had no\r\nchoice in the matter.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 80\r\n\r\n\r\nDe Dionysio fugit me ad te antea scribere; sed ita constitui,\r\nexspectare responsa Caesaris, ut, si ad urbem rediremus, ibi nos\r\nexspectaret, sin tardius id fieret, tum eum arcesseremus.

I am quite aware of what he ought to have done when I\r\ntook to flight, what was proper for a scholar and a friend, especially\r\nwhen he had been asked to do it: but I do not expect much from a Greek.\r\nBut please see, if I have to summon him, which I hope I shall not, that\r\nI may not be troubling a reluctant man.\r\n\r\nMy brother Quintus is anxious to give you a draft on Egnatius for the\r\nmoney he owes, and Egnatius is willing and has plenty of cash; but when\r\nthe times are such that Q.

He has neither spirit nor plan, nor forces, nor\r\nenergy. I say nothing of his most disgraceful flight from the city,\r\nhis timorous speeches in the towns, his ignorance not only of the\r\nstrength of his opponent but of his own forces: but what of this? On\r\nthe 7th of February C. Cassius the tribune came to Capua, and brought\r\nan order to the consuls to come to Rome, carry off the money from the\r\nreserve treasury[51] and leave at once. On quitting the city they are\r\nto return--but they have no escort: then there is the getting out\r\nof the city--who is going to give them leave? Lentulus replied that\r\nPompey must first come to Picenum. No one except myself knows it; but\r\nDolabella has written to me that that district is totally lost. I have\r\nno doubt but that Caesar is on the point of entering Apulia and that\r\nPompey is on board ship.\r\n\r\n[51] This reserve fund was said to have been founded originally to meet\r\na possible invasion of the Gauls. It was made up from spoils in war\r\nand from the 5 per cent tax on manumitted slaves. It was drawn upon in\r\nthe second Punic War (cf. Livy XXVII, 11). Caesar (_Bellum Civ._ 14)\r\nsays the consuls intended to open it before they left Rome; but fled in\r\nhaste at a report of his approach.\r\n\r\nWhat I am to do is a big problem. It would be no problem for me at\r\nall, if everything had not been disgracefully managed; and I had no\r\npart in the plan: still my proper course is a problem.

There is reason for you to fear butchery, not\r\nthat anything could be less advantageous to secure Caesar a lasting\r\nvictory and power; but I see on whose advice he will act. I hope it\r\nwill be all right; and I think we shall have to yield. As regards the\r\nOppii I have no suggestion to make. Do what you think best. You should\r\nspeak with Philotimus, and besides you will have Terentia on the 13th.\r\nWhat can I do? In what land or on what sea can I follow a man, when I\r\ndon't know where he is? After all how can I follow on land, and by sea\r\nwhither? Shall I then surrender to Caesar? Suppose I could surrender\r\nwith safety, as many advise, could I surrender with honour? By no\r\nmeans.

What, to\r\nslay him? Woe is me! And we do not all throw our bodies in the way! You\r\ntoo are sorry about it. But what can we do?

As for myself, I agree with you that I should\r\nnot commit myself to the danger and uncertainty of flight, seeing that\r\nit would avail nothing to State or Pompey, for whom I would dutifully\r\nand gladly die.

Cuius ego vicem doleo; qui urbem reliquit, id est\r\npatriam, pro qua et in qua mori praeclarum fuit. Ignorare mihi videris,\r\nhaec quanta sit clades. Es enim etiam nunc domi tuae, sed invitis\r\nperditissimis hominibus esse diutius non potes. Hoc miserius, hoc\r\nturpius quicquam? Vagamur egentes cum coniugibus et liberis; in unius\r\nhominis quotannis periculose aegrotantis anima positas omnes nostras\r\nspes habemus non expulsi, sed evocati ex patria; quam non servandam ad\r\nreditum nostrum, sed diripiendam et inflammandam reliquimus. Ita multi\r\nnobiscum sunt, non in suburbanis, non in hortis, non in ipsa urbe, et,\r\nsi nunc sunt, non erunt. Nos interea ne Capuae quidem, sed Luceriae,\r\net oram quidem maritimam iam relinquemus, Afranium exspectabimus et\r\nPetreium. Nam in Labieno parum est dignitatis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 103\r\n\r\npraised him highly. I had to do that, as I was an advocate of peace\r\nbetween them. If Caesar has passed on my letter, good: I should like\r\nhim to placard it in public. I have sent him another letter on the\r\ndate on which I dispatch this to you. I could not help doing so when\r\nhe and Balbus wrote to me. I send you a copy of the letter. I don't\r\nthink you can find any fault. If you can find any, tell me how I can\r\nescape criticism. You will say I should have sent no letter at all.\r\nWhat better plan to escape malicious tongues? However I will do so as\r\nlong as I can. Your exhortations to remember my deeds and words and\r\neven writings are friendly and very pleasant; but you seem to have a\r\ndifferent idea to mine as to honour and propriety in this business. To\r\nmy mind, no statesman or general has ever been guilty of conduct so\r\ndisgraceful as Pompey's. I am sorry for him. He left Rome, his country,\r\nfor which and in which it were glorious to die. You don't seem to me\r\nto realize what a disaster that is. You yourself are still in your own\r\nhouse; but you cannot stay there any longer without the consent of\r\nvillains and traitors. It is the depth of misery and shame. We wander\r\nin want with wives and children. Our sole hope lies in the life of\r\none man, who falls dangerously sick every year. We are not driven,\r\nbut summoned to leave our country. And our country which we have left\r\nwill not be kept in safety against our return, but abandoned to fire\r\nand plunder. So many Pompeians are with us, not in their suburban\r\nvillas, not in Rome, and, if some are still in Rome, they will soon go.\r\nMeantime I shall not stay at Capua, but at Luceria, and of course I\r\nshall abandon the coast at once. I shall wait for the move of Afranius\r\nand Petreius: for Labienus is a\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 104\r\n\r\nHic tu in me illud desideras.

Sic enim iam\r\nappellandum est.\r\n\r\n[59] _after_ me _and_ est _there is a space left in M, probably for\r\nsome Greek words, e.g._ ἀξίωμα _and_ ἀξίωσις _as Tyrrell and Orelli\r\nsuggest_.\r\n\r\nVibulli res gestae sunt adhuc maximae. Id ex Pompei litteris cognosces;\r\nin quibus animadvertito ilium locum, ubi erit διπλῆ. Videbis, de Gnaeo\r\nnostro ipse Vibullius quid existimet. Quo igitur haec spectat oratio?\r\nEgo pro Pompeio lubenter emori possum; facio pluris omnium hominum\r\nneminem; sed non ita, non in eo iudico spem de salute rei publicae.\r\nSignificas enim aliquanto secus, quam solebas, ut etiam Italia, si\r\nille cedat, putes cedendum. Quod ego nec rei publicae puto esse utile\r\nnec liberis meis, praeterea neque rectum neque honestum. Sed cur\r\n\"Poterisne igitur videre tyrannum?\" Quasi intersit, audiam an videam,\r\naut locupletior mihi sit quaerendus auctor quam Socrates; qui, cum XXX\r\ntyranni essent, pedem porta non extulit.

You may say that I am too. I say nothing\r\nof myself: I leave that to others. Who has standing here? All you\r\nloyalists stay at home, and will continue to stay there. Who failed me\r\nin the old days? Who supports me now in this war, as I must call it.\r\n\r\nSo far Vibullius' achievements have been fine. You will see that from\r\nPompey's letter. _Vide_ the passage marked.[60] You will see Vibullius'\r\nown opinion of Pompey. My point is that I can gladly die for Pompey's\r\nsake--there is no one I hold dearer; but not in that way. In him I\r\nsee no hope for the safety of the state. You express a view different\r\nfrom your usual view, that I must even leave Italy, if he does. That\r\ncourse seems to me of no advantage to the state or to my children, and,\r\nmoreover, neither right nor honourable. But why do you say, \"Will you\r\nbe able to see a tyrant\"? As if it mattered whether I hear of him or\r\nsee him, or as if I wanted a better example than Socrates, who never\r\nset foot out of gate during the reign of the Thirty tyrants. Besides I\r\nhave a special reason for staying. I wish I could talk it over with you.\r\n\r\n[60] The διπλῆ was a marginal mark of this shape =>= used in MSS. to\r\nmark a special passage or in dialogue to indicate the appearance of a\r\nnew speaker.\r\n\r\nAfter writing this letter on the 17th, by the same lamp as that in\r\nwhich I burned yours, I set out from Formiae to go to Pompey, and I may\r\nbe of use, if the talk is of peace: but, if of war, of what use shall I\r\nbe?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 106\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nCICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr. in Caleno XII K.

The whole question under debate is this. What do you think I\r\nshould do, if Pompey leaves Italy, as I expect he will? To help you to\r\na decision, I will briefly recount what occurs to me on both sides of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nNot only Pompey's great services in bringing about my restoration and\r\nhis intimacy with me, but the public welfare, leads me to think that\r\nmy policy and his or, if you will, my fortunes and his should be one.\r\nAnd another thing, if I remain in Italy and desert the company of\r\nloyal and distinguished citizens, I must fall into the power of one\r\nman, and, though he gives me many tokens of regard (and you know well\r\nI took good care that it should be so with this crisis in view), yet\r\nhe still leaves me a twofold problem; how much trust can be put in his\r\npromises, and, if I am positive of his good will, is it proper for a\r\nman of courage and loyalty to remain in Rome and lose his position for\r\nthe future where he has enjoyed the highest distinctions and commands,\r\nperformed deeds of importance, been invested with the highest seat in\r\nthe sacred college, and to suffer risks and perhaps some shame, if ever\r\nPompey restore the constitution? So much for the arguments on one side.\r\n\r\nNow look at those on the other. There is not an atom of prudence or\r\ncourage in Pompey's policy--and besides nothing that is not clean\r\ncontrary to my counsel and advice. I pass over the old grievance, how\r\nCaesar was Pompey's man: Pompey raised him to\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 108\r\n\r\naluit, auxit, armavit, ille legibus per vim et contra auspicia\r\nferendis auctor, ille Galliae ulterioris adiunctor, ille gener, ille\r\nin adoptando P. Clodio augur, ille restituendi mei quam retinendi\r\nstudiosior, ille provinciae propagator, ille absentis in omnibus\r\nadiutor, idem etiam tertio consulatu, postquam esse defensor rei\r\npublicae coepit, contendit, ut decem tribuni pl. ferrent, ut absentis\r\nratio haberetur, quod idem ipse sanxit lege quadam sua, Marcoque\r\nMarcello consuli finienti provincias Gallias Kalendarum Martiarum die\r\nrestitit--sed, ut haec omittam, quid foedius, quid perturbatius hoc ab\r\nurbe discessu sive potius turpissima fuga? Quae condicio non accipienda\r\nfuit potius quam relinquenda patria? Malae condiciones erant, fateor,\r\nsed num quid hoc peius? At recuperabit rem publicam. Quando? aut quid\r\nad eam spem est parati? Non ager Picenus amissus? non patefactum iter\r\nad urbem? non pecunia omnis et publica et privata adversario tradita?\r\nDenique nulla causa, nullae vires, nulla sedes, quo concurrent, qui rem\r\npublicam defensam velint. Apulia delecta est, inanissima pars Italiae\r\net ab impetu huius belli remotissima; fuga et maritima opportunitas\r\nvisa quaeri desperatione. Invite cepi Capuam, non quo munus illud\r\ndefugerem, sed in ea causa, in qua nullus\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 109\r\n\r\nplace and military power, assisted him in passing laws by force\r\nand despite bad omens, granted him Further Gaul in addition to his\r\nprovince; Pompey married his daughter, Pompey was augur at the adoption\r\nof Clodius; Pompey was more active in effecting my restoration than\r\nin preventing my banishment; Pompey prolonged the tenure of Caesar's\r\nprovincial government; Pompey championed his cause in absence; and\r\nagain in his third consulship, when he began to be the defender of\r\nthe constitution, struggled to get the ten tribunes to propose a bill\r\nadmitting Caesar's candidature in absence; ratified that privilege by\r\na law of his own; and opposed M. Marcellus the consul, when Marcellus\r\nwould have concluded Caesar's government of the provinces of Gaul on\r\nthe 1st of March. Putting all this on one side, is not this departure\r\nor rather this disgraceful and iniquitous flight from Rome a most\r\nshameful sign of panic? Any compromise ought to have been accepted\r\nin preference to abandoning our country. I admit the terms were bad,\r\nbut could anything be worse than this? If you say he will restore the\r\nconstitution, I ask you when and what preparation has been made to\r\nthat end? We have lost Picenum: the road lies open to Rome: the funds\r\nof the state and of individuals have been delivered to our enemy.\r\nFinally we have no policy, no forces, no rendezvous for patriots;\r\nApulia has been chosen, the least populous district in Italy and the\r\nmost removed from the brunt of this war, and clearly chosen in despair\r\nfor the opportunity of flight which the sea affords. With reluctance\r\nI took charge of Capua, not that I would shirk the duty, but with the\r\nreluctance which one would have in a\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 110\r\n\r\nesset ordinum, nullus apertus privatorum dolor, bonorum autem esset\r\naliquis, sed hebes, ut solet, et, ut ipse sensissem, multitudo et\r\ninfimus quisque propensus in alteram partem, multi mutationis rerum\r\ncupidi, dixi ipsi me nihil suscepturum sine praesidio et sine pecunia.\r\nItaque habui nihil omnino negotii, quod ab initio vidi nihil quaeri\r\npraeter fugam. Eam si nunc sequor, quonam? Cum illo non; ad quem cum\r\nessem profectus, cognovi in iis locis esse Caesarem, ut tuto Luceriam\r\nvenire non possem. Infero mari nobis incerto cursu hieme maxima\r\nnavigandum est. Age iam, cum fratre an sine eo cum filio? at quo modo?\r\nIn utraque enim re summa difficultas erit, summus animi dolor; qui\r\nautem impetus illius erit in nos absentis fortunasque nostras! Acrior\r\nquam in ceterorum, quod putabit fortasse in nobis violandis aliquid se\r\nhabere populare. Age iam, has compedes, fascis, inquam, hos laureatos\r\necferre ex Italia quam molestum est! qui autem locus erit nobis tutus,\r\nut iam placatis utamur fluctibus, antequam ad illum venerimus? Qua\r\nautem aut quo, nihil scimus. At, si restitero, et fuerit nobis in hac\r\nparte locus, idem fecero quod in Cinnae dominatione L. Philippus, quod\r\nL. Flaccus, quod Q. Mucius, quoquo modo ea res huic\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 111\r\n\r\ncause in which neither ranks nor individuals had expressed any feeling,\r\nthough there was some feeling amongst the loyalists, sluggish as\r\nusual. Besides, as I felt, the crowd and the dregs of the populace\r\nwere inclined to the other side, and many were merely desirous of\r\nrevolution. I told Pompey himself that I could undertake nothing\r\nwithout a garrison and without funds. So I have had nothing at all to\r\ndo, since I saw from the first, that his only object was flight. If I\r\nwould share his flight, whither am I to go? With him I cannot go; for,\r\nwhen I set out, I learned that Caesar was so posted that I could not\r\nreach Luceria with safety. I should have to go by the Lower Sea[61]\r\nin the depth of winter and with no certain destination. Moreover am\r\nI to take my brother, or leave him and take my son? But how? Either\r\ncourse would cause me the greatest trouble and the greatest grief: and\r\nhow he will wreak his rage on me and my property in my absence! More\r\nvindictively perhaps than in the case of others, because he will think\r\nthat vengeance on me will please the people. Consider too my fetters,\r\nI mean my laurelled fasces. How awkward it will be to take them out of\r\nItaly! Suppose I enjoy a calm passage, what place will be safe for me\r\ntill I join Pompey? I have no idea of how or where to go. But, if I\r\nstand my ground and find a place on Caesar's side, I shall follow the\r\nexample of L. Philippus under the tyranny of Cinna, of L. Flaccus and\r\nof Q. Mucius.[62] Though it ended unfortunately\r\n\r\n[61] I.e. the sea on the west coast of Italy as opposed to _mare\r\nsuperum_, the Adriatic.\r\n\r\n[62] All these persons stayed in Rome during the Cinnan revolution.\r\nMucius was put to death by the younger Marius in 82 B.C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 112\r\n\r\nquidem cecidit; qui tamen ita dicere solebat, se id fore videre, quod\r\nfactum est, sed malle quam armatum ad patriae moenia accedere. Aliter\r\nThrasybulus et fortasse melius. Sed est certa quaedam illa Muci ratio\r\natque sententia, est illa etiam Philippi, et, cum sit necesse, servire\r\ntempori et non amittere tempus, cum sit datum. Sed in hoc ipso habent\r\ntamen idem fasces molestiam. Sit enim nobis amicus, quod incertum\r\nest, sed sit; deferet triumphum. Non accipere vide ne periculosum\r\nsit, accipere invidiosum ad bonos. \"O rem,\" inquis, \"difficilem et\r\ninexplicabilem!\" Atqui explicanda est. Quid enim fieri potest? Ac, ne\r\nme existimaris ad manendum esse propensiorem, quod plura in eam partem\r\nverba fecerim, potest fieri, quod fit in multis quaestionibus, ut res\r\nverbosior haec fuerit, illa verior. Quam ob rem ut maxima de re aequo\r\nanimo deliberanti ita mihi des consilium velim. Navis et in Caieta est\r\nparata nobis et Brundisi.\r\n\r\nSed ecce nuntii scribente me haec ipsa noctu in Caleno, ecce litterae\r\nCaesarem ad Corfinium, Domitium Corfini cum firmo exercitu et pugnare\r\ncupiente. Non puto etiam hoc Gnaeum nostrum commissurum, ut Domitium\r\nrelinquat; etsi Brundisium Scipionem cum cohortibus duabus praemiserat,\r\nlegionem Fausto conscriptam in Siciliam sibi placere a consule duci\r\nscripserat ad consules. Sed turpe Domitium deserere erit implorantem\r\neius auxilium. Est quaedam spes mihi quidem non magna, sed in his locis\r\nfirma, Afranium in Pyrenaeo cum Trebonio pugnasse, pulsum Trebonium,\r\netiam Fabium tuum transisse cum\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 113\r\n\r\nin the case of Q. Mucius, yet he was wont to say he foresaw the issue,\r\nbut preferred it to taking arms against his country. Thrasybulus took\r\nthe other and perhaps happier course. But Mucius' decision and views\r\nwere quite definite, and so were those of Philippus; that one might do\r\nsome time-serving, when it was necessary, but when one's time came, one\r\nshould not miss it. But, in that event, still my fasces are a nuisance.\r\nI do not know if Caesar will be friendly; but suppose he is, he will\r\noffer me a triumph. To refuse would damage my chances with Caesar, to\r\naccept would annoy the loyalists. It is a hard and insoluble question;\r\nand yet solve it I must. What else can I do? I have said most in favour\r\nof staying in Italy: but do not infer that I have any particular\r\ninclination towards so doing: it may be, as often happens, that there\r\nare more words on one side and more worth on the other. Then please\r\ngive me your advice, counting me openminded on the important question.\r\nThere is a boat ready for me at Caieta and at Brundisium.\r\n\r\nBut, here are messengers arriving as I write this letter at night in\r\nCales; and here is a letter saying that Caesar has reached Corfinium\r\nand that Domitius is there with a strong force anxious to fight. I do\r\nnot think that Pompey will go so far as to abandon Domitius, though he\r\nsent Scipio ahead to Brundisium with two squadrons, and has informed\r\nthe consuls that he wants one of them to take the legion raised for\r\nFaustus into Sicily. But it were base to desert Domitius, when he\r\nentreats for help. There is some hope, small enough to my mind, but\r\nfavoured in this district, that Afranius has fought with Trebonius in\r\nthe Pyrenees and driven him back, and that your\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 114\r\n\r\ncohortibus, summa autem Afranium cum magnis copiis adventare. Id si\r\nest, in Italia fortasse manebitur. Ego autem, cum esset incertum iter\r\nCaesaris, quod vel ad Capuam vel ad Luceriam iturus putabatur, Leptam\r\nmisi ad Pompeium et litteras; ipse, ne quo inciderem, reverti Formias.\r\n\r\nHaec te scire volui scripsique sedatiore animo, quam proxime\r\nscripseram, nullum meum iudicium interponens, sed exquirens tuum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr. in Formiano VIII K.

If that is\r\ntrue, we may stay in Italy. But since no one knows Caesar's route, as\r\nhe was supposed to be going towards Capua or Luceria, I am sending\r\nLepta to Pompey with a letter. Myself I return to Formiae for fear I\r\nshould stumble on anyone.\r\n\r\nI wanted you to know the news, and I write with more composure than I\r\nstated above. I advance no views of my own, but ask for yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nCICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Formiae, Feb. 22_, B.C. _49_]\r\n\r\nI count Dionysius your man rather than mine: for, though I was well\r\nacquainted with his character, I held to your opinion of him rather\r\nthan to my own. The fellow has paid no respect even to your frequent\r\ncertificates of character, but has become arrogant in what he takes\r\nfor a fall in my fortune, though so far as human wit can avail, I will\r\nsteer my course onward with some skill. I never failed Dionysius in\r\nrespect or service, or in a good word for the despicable cad. Nay,\r\nI preferred to have my opinion criticized by Quintus and people in\r\ngeneral rather than omit to praise the fellow; and, sooner than seek\r\nanother master for my boys, I took pains to give them private lessons\r\nmyself.

Considering what has happened and is likely to\r\nhappen, I want my views on peace published. And when I exhorted Caesar\r\nof all men to seek peace, I had no readier argument than to say, that\r\npeace became a man of his wisdom. If I spoke of his \"admirable\" wisdom,\r\nseeing that I was urging him on to the salvation of our country, I was\r\nnot afraid of appearing to flatter him: in such a cause I would gladly\r\nhave cast myself at his feet. When I use the phrase \"spare time,\" that\r\ndoes not mean for the consideration of peace, but for the consideration\r\nof myself and my obligations. As to my statement that I have taken no\r\npart in the war, though the facts are evidence, I wrote it to give\r\ngreater weight to my advice and it was for the same reason that I\r\nexpressed approbation of his case.\r\n\r\nBut this is idle talk now: I only wish it had done some good. Why, I\r\nshould not object to the recital of my letter at a public meeting,\r\nwhen Pompey himself, writing to Caesar, exhibited for public perusal a\r\nletter containing the words \"On account of your splendid achievements,\"\r\n(are they more splendid\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 126\r\n\r\nquam Africani?

Sed, obsecro te, quid hoc miserius quam alterum\r\nplausus in foedissima causa quaerere, alterum offensiones in optima?\r\nalterum existimari conservatorem inimicorum, alterum desertorem\r\namicorum?

Surely his\r\nbelief in his rights will grow more vehement, when he sees you and\r\nmen like you not only in crowds, but with joy upon your faces. \"What\r\nharm in that,\" you ask? Not a bit, as far as you are concerned: but\r\nstill the outward signs of the distinction between genuine feeling and\r\npretence are all upset.

However their views influence\r\nme little: they have given fewer pledges to the state than I: but I am\r\nstrongly swayed by the weight of your opinion, which proposes a plan\r\nfor betterment in the future and security in the present. Is there a\r\nmore wretched spectacle than that of Caesar earning praise in the most\r\ndisgusting cause, and of Pompey earning blame in the most excellent:\r\nof Caesar being regarded as the saviour of his enemies, and Pompey\r\nas a traitor to his friends? Assuredly though I love Pompey, from\r\ninclination and duty, still I cannot praise his failure to succour such\r\nmen.

But let us\r\npass over this, for remembrance adds to my sorrow.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 24th, Balbus the younger came to me, hurrying on\r\na secret errand to the consul Lentulus from Caesar with a letter, a\r\ncommission, and the promise of a province on condition of his returning\r\nto Rome. I don't think that he can be talked over without a personal\r\ninterview. Balbus said that Caesar was most anxious to meet Pompey (I\r\nbelieve it), and to get on good terms with him. This I do not believe\r\nand I fear all his kindness is only a preparation for cruelty like\r\nCinna's. Balbus the elder writes to me that Caesar wants nothing better\r\nthan to live in safety under Pompey. I expect you will believe that.\r\nBut while I write this letter on the 25th of February, Pompey may have\r\nreached Brundisium. He set out without baggage, and before his legions,\r\non the 19th from Luceria. But that bogy-man has terrible wariness,\r\nspeed and energy. The future is a riddle to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nCICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Formiae, Feb. 26_, B.C. _49_]\r\n\r\nI spoke to Dionysius in the frankest way, when contrary to my\r\nexpectations he arrived. I told him how matters stood; asked him his\r\nintentions, and said that I would not press him against his will. He\r\nreplied that he did not know where such money as he owned was: that\r\nsome creditors did not pay, that other debts were not yet due. He said\r\nsomething about his wretched slaves that would prevent his\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 130\r\n\r\nesse non posset.

Mart. a. 705_]\r\n\r\nQuod me magno animi motu perturbatum putas, sum equidem, sed non tam\r\nmagno, quam tibi fortasse videor. Levatur enim omnis cura, cum aut\r\nconstitit consilium, aut cogitando nihil explicatur. Lamentari autem\r\nlicet illud quidem totos dies; sed vereor, ne, nihil cum proficiam,\r\netiam dedecori sim studiis ac litteris nostris. Consumo igitur omne\r\ntempus considerans, quanta vis sit illius viri, quem nostris libris\r\nsatis diligenter, ut tibi quidem videmur, expressimus. Tenesne igitur\r\nmoderatorem illum rei publicae quo referre velimus omnia? Nam sic\r\nquinto, ut opinor, in libro loquitur Scipio: \"Ut enim gubernatori\r\ncursus secundus, medico salus, imperatori victoria, sic huic moderatori\r\nrei publicae beata civium vita proposita est, ut opibus firma, copiis\r\nlocuples, gloria ampla, virtute honesta sit. Huius enim operis maximi\r\ninter homines atque optimi illum esse perfectorem volo.\" Hoc Gnaeus\r\nnoster cum antea numquam tum in hac causa minime cogitavit. Dominatio\r\nquaesita ab utroque est, non id actum, beata et honesta civitas ut\r\nesset. Nec vero ille urbem reliquit, quod eam tueri non posset, nec\r\nItaliam, quod ea pelleretur, sed hoc a primo cogitavit, omnes terras,\r\nomnia maria movere, reges barbaros incitare, gentes feras armatas in\r\nItaliam\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 131\r\n\r\nstaying with me. I acquiesced, sorry to lose a master for my boys;\r\nbut glad to be rid of an ungrateful fellow. I wanted you to know what\r\nhappened and my opinion of his conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nCICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Formiae, Feb. 27_, B.C. _49_]\r\n\r\nAs you suppose, I am in great anxiety of mind: but it is not so great\r\nas you may imagine. I am rid of care, as soon as resolve is fixed\r\nor thought proves futile. Still I may lament my lot as I do all day\r\nlong. But I fear, since lamentation is idle, I disgrace my philosophy\r\nand my works. So I spend my time considering the character of the\r\nideal statesman, who is sketched clearly enough, you seem to think,\r\nin my books on the Republic. You remember then the standard by which\r\nour ideal governor was to weigh his acts. Here are Scipio's words,\r\nin the 5th book, I think it is: \"As a safe voyage is the aim of the\r\npilot, health of the physician, victory of the general, so the ideal\r\nstatesman will aim at happiness for the citizens of the state to give\r\nthem material security, copious wealth, wide-reaching distinction\r\nand untarnished honour. This, the greatest and finest of human\r\nachievements, I want him to perform.\" Pompey never had this notion\r\nand least of all in the present cause. Absolute power is what he and\r\nCaesar have sought; their aim has not been to secure the happiness and\r\nhonour of the community. Pompey has not abandoned Rome, because it was\r\nimpossible to defend, nor Italy on forced compulsion; but it was his\r\nidea from the first to plunge the world into war, to stir up barbarous\r\nprinces, to bring savage tribes into\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 132\r\n\r\nadducere, exercitus conficere maximos. Genus illud Sullani regni iam\r\npridem appetitur multis, qui una sunt, cupientibus. An censes nihil\r\ninter eos convenire, nullam pactionem fieri potuisse? Hodie potest. Sed\r\nneutri σκοπὸς est ille, ut nos beati simus; uterque regnare vult.\r\n\r\nHaec a te invitatus breviter exposui. Voluisti enim me, quid, de his\r\nmails sentirem, ostendere. Προθεσπίζω igitur, noster Attice, non\r\nhariolans ut illa, cui nemo credidit, sed coniectura prospiciens:\r\n\r\n\"Iamque mari magno--\"\r\n\r\nnon multo, inquam, secus possum vaticinari. Tanta malorum impendet\r\nἸλιάς. Atque hoc nostra gravior est causa, qui domi sumus, quam\r\nillorum, qui una transierunt, quod illi quidem alterum metuunt, nos\r\nutrumque. \"Cur igitur,\" inquis, \"remansimus?\" Vel tibi paruimus vel non\r\noccurrimus, vel hoc fuit rectius. Conculcari, inquam, miseram Italiam\r\nvidebis proxima aestate aut utriusque in mancipiis ex omni genere\r\ncollectis, nec tam proscriptio pertimescenda, quae Luceriae multis\r\nsermonibus denuntiata esse dicitur, quam universae rei p. interitus.\r\nTantas in confligendo utriusque vires video futuras. Habes coniecturam\r\nmeam. Tu autem consolationis fortasse aliquid exspectasti. Nihil\r\ninvenio, nihil fieri potest miserius, nihil perditius, nihil foedius.\r\n\r\nQuod quaeris, quid Caesar ad me scripserit, quod saepe, gratissimum\r\nsibi esse, quod quierim, oratque, in eo ut perseverem. Balbus minor\r\nhaec eadem mandata. Iter autem eius erat ad Lentulum consulem cum\r\nlitteris Caesaris praemiorumque promissis, si\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 133\r\n\r\nItaly under arms, and to gather a huge army. A sort of Sulla's reign\r\nhas long been his object, and is the desire of many of his companions.\r\nOr do you think that no agreement, no compromise between him and Caesar\r\nwas possible? Why, it is possible to-day: but neither of them looks to\r\nour happiness. Both want to be kings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ennius, _Alexander_.]\r\n\r\nAt your request I have given an outline of my views; for you wanted an\r\nexpression of my opinion on these troubles. So I play the prophet, my\r\ndear Atticus, not at random like Cassandra whom no one believed, but\r\nwith imaginative insight. \"Now on the great sea\" my prophecy runs like\r\nthe old tag: such an Iliad of woe hangs over us. The case of us, who\r\nstay at home, is worse than that of those who have gone with Pompey,\r\nfor they have only one to fear, while we have both. You ask then, why\r\nI stay. Well, in compliance with your request, or because I could not\r\nmeet Pompey on his departure, or because it was the more honourable\r\ncourse. I say you will see poor Italy trodden down next summer or in\r\nthe hands of their slaves drawn from every quarter of the globe. It\r\nwill not be a proscription (in spite of the talk and threats we hear\r\nof at Luceria) which we shall have to dread, but general destruction.\r\nSo huge are the forces that will join in the struggle. That is my\r\nprophecy. Perhaps you looked for consolation. I see none: we have\r\nreached the limit of misery, ruin and disgrace.\r\n\r\nYou inquire what Caesar said in his letter. The usual thing, that my\r\ninaction pleases him, and he begs me to maintain it. Balbus the younger\r\nbrought the same message by word of mouth. Balbus was travelling to\r\nLentulus the consul with letters from Caesar, and\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 134\r\n\r\nRomam revertisset.

I gather that\r\nmatters in Picenum were much more satisfactory than I had heard, and am\r\nglad to learn of the bravery and energy of Vibullius.\r\n\r\nSo far I have stayed on this coast where I was given the command, but\r\nI have kept a boat ready. For the news and my fears were such that I\r\nfelt I must follow any plan you should make. But now your influence\r\nand your policy have encouraged me, I will stay in the coast districts\r\nand Tarracina, if you think that the district can be held. The towns,\r\nhowever, are without garrison, for there is no member of the Senate in\r\nthe district except M. Eppius, a man of foresight and energy, whom I\r\ndesired to stay at Menturnae. The gallant and influential L. Torquatus\r\nis not at Formiae, but I fancy has set out to join you.\r\n\r\nIn entire accord with your latest instructions, I went to Capua on the\r\nvery day you left Teanum Sidicinum. For you had desired me to take\r\npart with M. Considius the propraetor in looking after things there.\r\nOn arrival I found that T. Ampius was holding a levy with the greatest\r\nenergy, and that the troops raised were being taken over by Libo, a\r\nlocal man of energy and influence. I stayed at Capua as long as the\r\nconsuls. Once again in accordance with instructions from the consuls\r\nI went to Capua for the 5th of February. After a stay of three days I\r\nreturned to Formiae.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 138\r\n\r\n\r\nNunc quod tuum consilium aut quae ratio belli sit, ignoro.

Interim nondum meis litteris\r\nad te perlatis ex iis mandatis, quae D. Laelio ad consules dederas,\r\ncertior tui consilii factus non exspectavi, dum mihi a te litterae\r\nredderentur, confestimque cum Quinto fratre et cum liberis nostris\r\niter ad te in Apuliam facere coepi. Cum Teanum Sidicinum venissem,\r\nC. Messius, familiaris tuus, mihi dixit aliique complures Caesarem\r\niter habere Capuam et eo ipso die mansurum esse Aeserniae, Sane sum\r\ncommotus, quod, si ita esset, non modo iter meum interclusum, sed\r\nme ipsum plane exceptum putabam. Itaque tum Cales processi, ut ibi\r\npotissimum consisterem, dum certum nobis ab Aesernia de eo, quod\r\naudieram, referretur.\r\n\r\nAt mihi, cum Calibus essem, adfertur litterarum tuarum exemplum, quas\r\ntu ad Lentulum consulem misisses. Hae scriptae sic erant, litteras tibi\r\na L. Domitio a. d. XIII Kal. Martias allatas esse (earumque exemplum\r\nsubscripseras); magnique interesse rei publicae scripseras omnes copias\r\nprimo quoque tempore in unum locum convenire, et ut, praesidio quod\r\nsatis esset, Capuae relinqueret. His ego litteris lectis in eadem\r\nopinione fui qua reliqui omnes, te cum omnibus copiis ad Corfinium esse\r\nventurum; quo mihi, cum Caesar ad oppidum castra haberet, tutum iter\r\nesse non abritrabar.\r\n\r\nCum res in summa exspectatione esset, utrumque simul audivimus, et quae\r\nCorfini acta essent, et te iter Brundisium facere coepisse; cumque nec\r\nmihi nec fratri meo dubium esset, quin Brundisium contenderemus,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 141\r\n\r\nwelfare would drive you to flight across the seas, and I had great\r\nhopes that it might be in Italy we should either conclude peace\r\n(the wisest course to my mind) or fight for the state with honour\r\nuntarnished. My letter cannot have reached you yet, but from the\r\nmessage which you entrusted to D. Laelius for the consuls I learnt of\r\nyour plans. I did not wait for a reply to my letter, but forthwith\r\nset out along with my brother Quintus and the children to join you in\r\nApulia. On arrival at Teanum Sidicinum I was told by your friend C.\r\nMessius, and many other people, that Caesar was on his way to Capua,\r\nand would bivouac that very day at Aesernia. I was really startled,\r\nas it occurred to me, that, if that was so, my road was closed, and I\r\nmyself was quite captured. So I went to Cales, choosing that particular\r\nplace to stay at, till I should get certain news from Aesernia as to\r\nthe rumour I had heard.\r\n\r\nAt Cales I received a copy of your letter to Lentulus the consul.\r\nIts purport was that you had got a letter (of which you subjoined a\r\ncopy) from L. Domitius on the 17th of February, and you considered it\r\nof the greatest public importance to concentrate your forces on the\r\nearliest possible occasion, and that a sufficient garrison should be\r\nleft at Capua. On the perusal of this dispatch I agreed with others in\r\nsupposing that you would come in full force to Corfinium. As Caesar was\r\nencamped against the town, I considered the road thither was not safe\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nAnxiously awaiting news, I heard two reports at the same time: news\r\nof the affair of Corfinium, and that you were coming to Brundisium.\r\nNeither I nor my brother had any hesitation about starting for\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 142\r\n\r\na multis, qui e Samnio Apuliaque veniebant, admoniti sumus, ut\r\ncaveremus, ne exciperemur a Caesare, quod is in eadem loca, quae\r\nnos petebamus, profectus celerius etiam, quam nos possemus, eo, quo\r\nintenderet, venturus esset. Quod cum ita esset, nec mihi nec fratri meo\r\nnec cuiquam amicorum placuit committere, ut temeritas nostra non solum\r\nnobis, sed etiam rei publicae noceret, cum praesertim non dubitaremus,\r\nquin, si etiam tutum nobis iter fuisset, te tamen iam consequi non\r\npossemus.\r\n\r\nInterim accepimus tuas litteras Canusio a. d. X K. Martias datas,\r\nquibus nos hortaris, ut celerius Brundisium veniamus. Quas cum\r\naccepissemus a. d. III K. Martias, non dubitabamus, quin tu iam\r\nBrundisium pervenisses, nobisque iter illud omnino interclusum\r\nvidebamus neque minus nos esse captos, quam qui Corfini fuissent. Neque\r\nenim eos solos arbitrabamur capi, qui in armatorum manus incidissent,\r\nsed ecs nihilo minus, qui regionibus exclusi intra praesidia atque\r\nintra arma aliena venissent.\r\n\r\nQuod cum ita sit, maxime vellem primum semper tecum fuissem; quod\r\nquidem tibi ostenderam, cum a me Capuam reiciebam. Quod feci non\r\nvitandi oneris causa, sed quod videbam teneri illam urbem sine exercitu\r\nnon posse, accidere autem mihi nolebam, quod doleo viris fortissimis\r\naccidisse. Quoniam autem, tecum ut essem, non contigit, utinam tui\r\nconsilii certior factus essem! Nam suspicione adsequi non potui, quod\r\nomnia prius arbitratus sum fore, quam ut haec rei publicae causa in\r\nItalia non posset duce te consistere. Neque vero nunc consilium tuum\r\nreprehendo, sed fortunam rei publicae lugeo nec, si\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 143\r\n\r\nBrundisium, when many travellers from Samnium and Apulia warned us to\r\nbeware of capture, because Caesar had set out for the same destination,\r\nand was likely to reach there quicker than ourselves. Under those\r\ncircumstances, I, my brother and our friends were reluctant to allow\r\nany rashness of ours to damage the state as well as ourselves.\r\nMoreover, we were sure that, even if our path were clear, we could not\r\novertake you.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I got a letter from you dated at Canusium, of the 20th of\r\nFebruary, in which you urged me to hasten to Brundisium. Receiving this\r\non the 27th, I felt confident you must have arrived at Brundisium,\r\nand I saw that our road was quite cut off and we were as completely\r\ncaptured as the people at Corfinium, for I do not only consider\r\ncaptured those who fall into the hands of armed bands, but equally\r\nthose who, being shut off from a district, find themselves hedged\r\nbetween a garrison and an enemy in the field.\r\n\r\nThis being so, my first and chiefest wish is that I had stayed with you\r\nall the time. I showed you as much when I gave up command at Capua. I\r\ndid so, not to shirk my duty, but because I saw that the city could not\r\nbe held without troops, and I was reluctant to suffer the fate which I\r\nam sorry to hear has befallen some very brave men. Since, however, I\r\nhave not had the fortune to be with you, would that I were acquainted\r\nwith your plans, for I cannot imagine them, having hitherto thought\r\nthat the last thing to happen would be that the national cause would\r\nnot hold its own in Italy under your leadership. I do not criticize\r\nyour plan, but I bewail the misfortunes of the state. If I cannot guess\r\nyour\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 144\r\n\r\nego, quid tu sis secutus, non perspicio, idcirco minus existimo te\r\nnihil nisi summa ratione fecisse.\r\n\r\nMea quae semper fuerit sententia primum de pace vel iniqua condicione\r\nretinenda, deinde de urbe (nam de Italia quidem nihil mihi umquam\r\nostenderas), meminisse te arbitror. Sed mihi non sumo, ut meum\r\nconsilium valere debuerit; secutus sum tuum neque id rei publicae\r\ncausa, de qua desperavi, quae et nunc adflicta est nec excitari sine\r\ncivili perniciosissimo bello potest, sed te quaerebam, tecum esse\r\ncupiebam neque eius rei facultatem, si quae erit, praetermittam.\r\n\r\nEgo me in hac omni causa facile intellegebam pugnandi cupidis hominibus\r\nnon satis facere. Primum enim prae me tuli me nihil malle quam pacem,\r\nnon quin eadem timerem quae illi, sed ea bello civili leviora ducebam.\r\nDeinde suscepto bello, cum pacis condiciones ad te adferri a teque\r\nad eas honorifice et large responderi viderem, duxi meam rationem;\r\nquam tibi facile me probaturum pro tuo in me beneficio arbitrabar.\r\nMemineram me esse unum, qui pro meis maximis in rem publicam meritis\r\nsupplicia miserrima et crudelissima pertulissem, me esse unum, qui, si\r\noffendissem eius animum, cui tum, cum iam in armis essemus, consulatus\r\ntamen alter et triumphus amplissimus deferebatur, subicerer eisdem\r\nproeliis, ut mea persona semper ad improborum civium impetus aliquid\r\nvideretur habere populare. Atque haec non ego prius sum suspicatus,\r\nquam mihi palam denuntiata sunt, neque ea tam pertimui, si subeunda\r\nessent, quam declinanda putavi, si honeste vitare possem. Quam brevem\r\nillius temporis, dum in spe pax fuit,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 145\r\n\r\npolicy, I still suppose that you have done nothing without cogent\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nI think you remember that my vote has always been for peace, even on\r\npoor terms, and secondly for holding the city. As to Italy you gave\r\nme no inkling. I do not claim that my policy should have prevailed.\r\nI followed yours, not indeed for the sake of the state, of which I\r\ndespaired and which even now lies in ruin and cannot be restored\r\nwithout a most calamitous civil war, but I wanted you, I longed to be\r\nwith you, nor will I omit any opportunity that may occur of attaining\r\nmy wish.\r\n\r\nIn the whole of this crisis I was well aware that my policy of peace\r\ndid not please the advocates of war. In the first place I professed to\r\nprefer peace above all things, not because I had not the same fears\r\nas they had, but because I counted those fears of less moment than\r\nintestine war. Then indeed, after war had begun, when I saw terms of\r\npeace offered to you, and met by you in an honourable and generous way,\r\nI began to consider what my own interests were. That line of conduct I\r\nsuppose your kindness will easily excuse. I remembered that I was the\r\none man of all others who had suffered most cruel misery and punishment\r\nfor the greatest services to the state; that I was the one man who, if\r\nI had offended Caesar (Caesar to whom was offered even on the eve of\r\nbattle a second consulship and a princely triumph), would be subjected\r\nto the same struggle as before; for a personal attack on me seems to be\r\nalways popular with the disloyal. This idea only came to me after open\r\nthreats. It was not persecution I feared, if it were inevitable, but I\r\nthought I should seek any escape that honour could allow. There is an\r\noutline\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 146\r\n\r\nrationem nostram vides, reliqui facultatem res ademit. Iis autem,\r\nquibus non satis facio, facile respondeo. Neque enim ego amicior C.\r\nCaesari umquam fui quam illi neque illi amiciores rei publicae quam\r\nego. Hoc inter me et illos interest, quod, cum et illi cives optimi\r\nsint, et ego ab ista laude non absim, ego condicionibus, quod idem te\r\nintellexeram velle, illi armis disceptari maluerunt. Quae quoniam ratio\r\nvicit, perficiam profecto, ut neque res publica civis a me animum neque\r\ntu amici desideres.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nCICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr.

Dictare tamen\r\nhanc epistulam malui quam Gallo Fadio amantissimo utriusque nostrum\r\nnihil ad te litterarum dare. Nam pridie quidem, quoquo modo potueram,\r\nscripseram ipse eas litteras, quarum vaticinationem falsam esse cupio.\r\nHuius autem epistulae non solum ea causa est, ut ne quis a me dies\r\nintermittatur, quin dem ad te litteras, sed etiam haec iustior, ut a te\r\nimpetrarem, ut sumeres aliquid temporis, quo quia tibi perexiguo opus\r\nest, explicari mihi tuum consilium plane volo, ut penitus intellegam.\r\n\r\nOmnia sunt integra nobis; nihil praetermissum est, quod non habeat\r\nsapientem excusationem, non modo probabilem.

I have an easy reply to my critics. I have\r\nnever been more friendly to Caesar than they, and they are not more\r\nfriendly to the state than I. The difference between them and me is\r\nthis: they are loyal citizens, and I too deserve the title, but I\r\nwanted settlement on terms which I understood you also desired, and\r\nthey wanted settlement by arms. Since their policy has won, I will do\r\nmy best that the state may not find me fail in the duties of a citizen,\r\nnor you in the duties of a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nCICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Formiae, Febr. 28_, B.C. _49_]\r\n\r\nI am even more troubled by inflammation of the eyes than I was before.\r\nStill I prefer to dictate this letter, rather than let Gallus Fadius,\r\nwho has a sincere regard for us both, have no letter to give you.\r\nYesterday I wrote myself to the best of my ability a letter containing\r\nprognostications, which I hope may prove false. One excuse for the\r\npresent missive is my desire to let no day pass without communicating\r\nwith you, but there is a still more reasonable excuse, to beg you to\r\ndevote a little time to my case, and, as it will be a short business,\r\nI hope you will explain your view thoroughly and make it quite\r\nintelligible to me.\r\n\r\nI have not committed myself at all. There has been no omission on my\r\npart for which I cannot give not merely a plausible but a reasonable\r\nexcuse. Assuredly I was not guilty of any fault, when, to avoid\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 148\r\n\r\nimparatam Capuam non solum ignaviae dedecus, sed etiam perfidiae\r\nsuspicionem fugiens accipere nolui, neque cum post condiciones pacis\r\nper L. Caesarem et L. Fabatum allatas cavi, ne animum eius offenderem,\r\ncui Pompeius iam armatus armato consulatum triumphumque deferret. Nec\r\nvero haec extrema quisquam potest iure reprehendere, quod mare non\r\ntransierim. Id enim, etsi erat deliberationis, tamen obire non potui.\r\nNeque enim suspicari debui, praesertim cum ex ipsius Pompei litteris,\r\nidem quod video te existimasse, non dubitarim, quin is Domitio\r\nsubventurus esset, et plane, quid rectum et quid faciendum mihi esset,\r\ndiutius cogitare malui.\r\n\r\nPrimum igitur, haec qualia tibi esse videantur, etsi significata sunt\r\na te, tamen accuratius mihi perscribas velim, deinde aliquid etiam in\r\nposterum prospicias fingasque, quem me esse deceat, et ubi me plurimum\r\nprodesse rei publicae sentias, ecquae pacifica persona desideretur an\r\nin bellatore sint omnia.\r\n\r\nAtque ego, qui omnia officio metior, recordor tamen tua consilia;\r\nquibus si paruissem, tristitiam illorum temporum non subissem. Memini,\r\nquid mihi tum suaseris per Theophanem, per Culleonem, idque saepe\r\ningemiscens sum recordatus. Quare nunc saltem ad illos calculos\r\nrevertamur, quos tum abiecimus, ut non solum gloriosis consiliis\r\nutamur, sed etiam paulo salubrioribus. Sed nihil praescribo; accurate\r\nvelim perscribas tuam ad me sententiam. Volo etiam exquiras, quam\r\ndiligentissime poteris\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 149\r\n\r\nblame for cowardice and the charge of treachery to boot, I refused to\r\ntake over Capua in its unprepared state. Nor am I to blame, when, after\r\nL. Caesar and L. Fabatus had brought terms of peace, I took precautions\r\nnot to incur the enmity of a man to whom Pompey was offering the\r\nconsulship and a triumph, when both were under arms. Finally I cannot\r\nrightly be called to account for not crossing the sea: for, though that\r\nwas a course which was worthy of consideration, still I could not keep\r\nPompey's appointment. Nor could I guess his policy, especially as from\r\nhis own letter, as I see you inferred, I had no idea that he would fail\r\nto relieve Domitius. And certainly I wanted time to consider what was\r\nright and what I ought to do.\r\n\r\nFirstly, then, I wish you would write me a careful account of your\r\nviews, though you have already outlined them, and secondly that you\r\nwould glance at the future, and give me an idea of what course you\r\nthink would become me, where you suppose I can serve the state best,\r\nand whether the part of a man of peace is required at all, or whether\r\neverything depends on a fighter.\r\n\r\nAnd I, who test everything by the standard of duty, yet remember\r\nyour advice. Had I followed it, I should have been saved from the\r\nwretchedness of that crisis in my life. I call to mind the counsel\r\nyou sent me then by Theophanes and Culleo, and the memory of it often\r\nmakes me groan. So let me now at last go over the old reckoning which\r\nthen I cast aside, to the end that I may follow a plan, which has in\r\nview not only glory, but also some measure of safety. However, I make\r\nno conditions: please give me your candid opinion.

My fears\r\nhave been realized. Domitius has been trapped and is not strong enough\r\nhimself to pitch a camp, because he has my nineteen and his own twelve\r\ncohorts scattered in three towns (for some he has stationed at Alba and\r\nsome at Sulmo), and he is unable to free himself even if he wished.\r\n\r\nI must inform you that this has caused me the greatest anxiety. I am\r\nanxious to free men so numerous and of such importance from the danger\r\nof a siege, and I cannot go to their assistance, because I do not think\r\nthat I can trust these two\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 152\r\n\r\nnon puto esse committendum, ut illuc ducantur, ex quibus tamen non\r\namplius XIIII cohortes contrahere potui, quod duas Brundisium misi\r\nneque Canusium sine praesidio, dum abessem, putavi esse dimittendum.\r\n\r\nD.

Laelius, that with your\r\napproval one of you should come to me, and the other set out for Sicily\r\nwith the force you have collected at Capua and in the neighbourhood,\r\nand with Faustus' recruits; that Domitius with his twelve cohorts\r\nshould join up, and all the other troops should concentrate at\r\nBrundisium, and from thence be taken by sea to Dyrrachium. Now,\r\nsince at the present time I am no more able than yourselves to go to\r\nDomitius' assistance [and it remains for him][72] to extricate himself\r\nby the mountain route, I must take steps that the enemy may not meet my\r\nfourteen doubtful cohorts or overtake me on the march.\r\n\r\n[72] Some words appear to be missing here.\r\n\r\nAccordingly--and I see M.

Wherefore,\r\nas you had arranged, according to Vibullius' letter, to start with\r\nyour army from Corfinium on the 9th of February and to come to me, I\r\nwonder what reason there has been for your change of plan. The reason\r\nmentioned by Vibullius is trivial, namely that you were delayed on\r\nhearing that Caesar had left Firmum and arrived at Castrum Truentinum.\r\nFor the nearer our enemy begins to approach, the quicker you ought to\r\nhave joined forces with me, before Caesar could obstruct your march or\r\ncut me off from you.\r\n\r\nWherefore again and again I entreat and exhort you--as I did in my\r\nprevious letter--to come to Luceria on the first possible day, before\r\nthe forces which Caesar has begun to collect can concentrate and divide\r\nus. But, if people try to keep you back to protect their country seats,\r\nI must ask you to dispatch to me the cohorts, which have come from\r\nPicenum and Camerinum abandoning their own interests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 156\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIIc\r\n\r\nCN.

Calenius has brought me a letter from you dated the 16th of\r\nFebruary, in which you express the intention of watching Caesar and\r\nhurrying to join me in Samnium, if he shall begin to march against me\r\nalong the coast: but, if he linger in your neighbourhood, you say you\r\nwish to oppose his nearer advance.\r\n\r\nTo my mind your policy is ambitious and brave, but we must take great\r\ncare that, if divided, we may not be outmatched by the enemy, since\r\nCaesar has numerous troops and in a short time will have more. A man\r\nof your judgement ought to bear in mind not only the size of Caesar's\r\npresent array against you but the number of infantry and cavalry that\r\nhe will soon collect. Evidence of that contingency is in the letter\r\nwhich Bussenius dispatched to me, and it agrees with the missives from\r\nothers in stating that Curio is concentrating the garrisons which were\r\nin Umbria and Etruria and marching to join Caesar. With these forces\r\ncombined, though one division may be sent to Alba, and another advance\r\non you, and though Caesar may refrain from the offensive and be content\r\nto defend his position, still you will be in a fix, nor will you be\r\nable with your following to make sufficient head against such numbers\r\nto allow of your sending out foraging parties.\r\n\r\nTherefore I beg you earnestly to come here on the first opportunity\r\nwith all your forces. The consuls have decided to do the same. I have\r\ninstructed\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 158\r\n\r\nmandata dedi providendum esse, ne duae legiones sine Picentinis\r\ncohortibus in conspectum Caesaris committerentur. Quam ob rem nolito\r\ncommoveri, si audieris me regredi, si forte Caesar ad me veniet;\r\ncavendum enim puto esse, ne implicatus haeream. Nam neque castra\r\npropter anni tempus et militum animos facere possum, neque ex omnibus\r\noppidis contrahere copias expedit, ne receptum amittam. Itaque non\r\namplius xiiii cohortes Luceriam coegi. Consules praesidia omnia\r\ndeducturi sunt aut in Siciliam ituri. Nam aut exercitum firmum habere\r\noportet, quo confidamus perrumpere nos posse, aut regiones eius modi\r\nobtinere, e quibus repugnemus; id quod neutrum nobis hoc tempore\r\ncontigit, quod et magnam partem Italiae Caesar occupavit, et nos non\r\nhabemus exercitum tam amplum neque tam magnum quam ille. Itaque nobis\r\nprovidendum est, ut summam rei publicae rationem habeamus. Etiam\r\natque etiam te hortor, ut cum omni copia quam primum ad me venias.\r\nPossumus etiam nunc rem publicam erigere, si communi consilio negotium\r\nadministrabimus; si distrahemur, infirmi erimus.

Tuscilius to tell you that we must beware lest the two legions\r\nwithout the cohorts from Picenum come within sight of Caesar.\r\nAccordingly do not be disturbed if you hear of my retreat in the face\r\nof Caesar's possible advance, for I consider that I must take every\r\nstep to avoid being trapped. The season of the year and the spirit of\r\nmy troops prevents me from making a camp; nor is it wise to collect the\r\ngarrisons from all the towns, lest room for retreat be lost. So I have\r\nnot mustered more than fourteen cohorts at Luceria. The consuls will\r\nbring in all their garrisons to me or start for Sicily. We must either\r\nhave an army strong enough to allow of our breaking through the enemy's\r\nlines, or get and hold localities we can defend. At the present moment\r\nwe have neither of those advantages: a large part of Italy is held by\r\nCaesar, and our army is neither so well equipped nor so large as his.\r\nWe must therefore take care to look to the main issue. Again and again\r\nI beg you to come to me as soon as possible with all your forces. Even\r\nnow the constitution may be restored, if we take common counsel in our\r\naction. Division means weakness: of that I am positive.\r\n\r\nAfter I had written my letter Sicca brought me a dispatch and message\r\nfrom you. I fear I cannot comply with your request for assistance,\r\nbecause I do not put much trust in these legions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIId\r\n\r\nCN.

I am quite aware that there has been no time, since\r\nfear drove me to flight, when silence and no letters would have been\r\nmore appropriate, for the good reason that there is no fresh news at\r\nRome, nor here--two or three days' journey nearer Brundisium. The issue\r\nof this first campaign will turn entirely on the action at Brundisium:\r\nand I am on thorns to hear the result. However, all will be known by\r\nthe 7th. On the noon of the day (that is the 21st of February), on the\r\nmorning of which Pompey left Canusium, I see that Caesar set out from\r\nCorfinium. But Caesar marches in such a way, and so spurs his men with\r\nlargess, that I fear he may reach Brundisium sooner than we\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 164\r\n\r\nopus sit, accesserit.

Non mihi satis idonei\r\nsunt auctores ii, qui a te probantur. Quod enim umquam eorum in re\r\npublica forte factum exstitit? aut quis ab iis ullam rem laude dignam\r\ndesiderat?

You may wonder why I forestall disagreeable tidings which will be\r\nknown in three days' time. I have no reason, except, as I said before,\r\nthat I love to talk to you; and at the same time I want you to know\r\nthat what I had counted my fixed resolve is shaken. The precedents you\r\nquote with approval don't quite fit my case. They are those of men who\r\nhave never distinguished themselves by great political action, and\r\nare not looked up to for any act of merit. Nor, let me tell you, have\r\nI any praise for those who have crossed the sea to make preparations\r\nfor war--unbearable as things here were. For I foresee how great and\r\ncalamitous that war will be. I am influenced only by one man, whom\r\nI think I ought to accompany in flight, and help in the restoration\r\nof the constitution. I may seem variable; but I talk with you as I\r\ntalk with myself, and there is no one who, in such a crisis, does not\r\nview matters in many lights. Moreover, I want to get your opinion,\r\nto encourage me, if you have not changed it, or otherwise to win my\r\nassent. It is particularly necessary for me to know in my dilemma what\r\ncourse Domitius and my friend Lentulus will take.\r\n\r\nAs for Domitius I hear many reports: at one time that he is at Tibur\r\nout of sorts, at another that he has consorted with the Lepidi in\r\ntheir march to Rome. That I see is untrue. For Lepidus says that he\r\nis following a hidden path, but whether to hide or reach the sea even\r\nhe does not know. Lepidus has no news about his son either. He adds a\r\nprovoking detail, that Domitius has failed to get back a large sum of\r\nmoney which he had at Corfinium. Of Lentulus I have no news. Please\r\nmake inquiries on these points and inform me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 166\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nCICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr.

You also wanted to know how I\r\nshall receive Caesar on his return. I intend to shun him altogether.\r\nAnd you contemplate flight on the day he comes, and a change in your\r\nlife, which I agree is politic.

You seem to have no doubt as to what I ought\r\nto do, if the consuls go over-seas; well they will go, or rather have\r\nnow gone. But bear in mind that of their number it is practically only\r\nAppius who has not a right to cross. The rest are either invested\r\nwith military power, like Pompey, Scipio, Sufenas, Fannius, Voconius,\r\nSestius and the consuls themselves, who by old custom may visit all the\r\nprovinces; or else they are legates.

When he becomes settled and\r\nrecovers from fright, I shall have better hopes that your influence may\r\navail with him.\r\n\r\nIn desiring my friend the consul Lentulus to remain in Rome, you have\r\ngratified Caesar, and myself too, I may assure you, in the highest\r\ndegree. I value Lentulus as much as Caesar. If he had allowed me\r\nto renew my old intercourse, and had not again and again avoided\r\nconversation with me, I should be less unhappy than I am. For do not\r\nthink that this crisis causes anyone more torment than it causes me,\r\nwhen I see him, to whom I am more devoted than to myself, acting in\r\noffice in a way quite unfitted for a consul. If he only takes your\r\nadvice and believes our professions about Caesar, and serves the\r\nremainder of his office in Rome, then I shall begin to hope that by\r\nthe advice of the Senate, on your suggestion and at his formal motion,\r\nthere may be effected a reconciliation between Pompey and Caesar. In\r\nthat event I shall think my life's mission accomplished.\r\n\r\nI know that you will approve entirely of Caesar's action about\r\nCorfinium. Under the circumstances there could have been nothing\r\nbetter than a settlement without bloodshed. I am delighted that you\r\nare pleased with the arrival of my and your Balbus. Whatever Balbus\r\nhas told you about Caesar, and whatever Caesar has said to you in his\r\nletters, I am confident Caesar will convince you by his acts, be his\r\nfortune what it will, that his professions were quite sincere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 172\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nCICERO ATTICO,\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr.

The other route I cannot face at this time of the\r\nyear. How can I get to that place on which my mind is set, and whither\r\nfate calls? My departure must be in haste, for fear some obstacle and\r\nhindrance should arise. It is not, as one might think, Pompey who\r\ninduces me to go. I have long known him to be the poorest of statesmen,\r\nand I now see he is the poorest of generals. I am not induced by him,\r\nbut by the common talk of which Philotimus informs me. He says that the\r\nloyalists are tearing me to tatters. Loyalists, good God! And see how\r\nthey are running to meet Caesar, and selling themselves to him. The\r\ncountry towns are treating him as a god, and there is no pretence about\r\nit, as there was in the prayers for Pompey's recovery from illness.\r\nAny mischief this Pisistratus may leave undone will give as much\r\nsatisfaction as if he had prevented another from doing it. People hope\r\nto placate Caesar; they think that Pompey is angered. What ovations\r\nfrom the towns and what honour is paid him! In fright I dare say, but\r\nthey are more afraid of Pompey. They are delighted with the cunning\r\nkindness of Caesar, and afraid of the anger of his rival. Those who are\r\non the jury list of 360 judges, the especial partisans of Pompey, some\r\nof whom I see daily, shudder at vague Lucerias[79] which they conjure\r\nup. So I ask what sort of loyalists are\r\n\r\n[79] Cf. VIII, 11, where Pompey at Luceria is said to have talked of a\r\nproscription.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 174\r\n\r\nqui me exturbent, cum ipsi domi maneant.

Why do I say \"some news,\" when it is news of his\r\ndisgraceful flight, and the route by which the victor is returning and\r\nthe direction in which he is moving.

How much\r\nmore will this annoy him! Why, as much more as this honour is greater\r\nthan that, and he himself is stronger. As for your remark that you\r\nhave no doubt I am in bad odour with Pompey at this present time, I\r\nsee no reason why it should be so, especially at this time. Pompey did\r\nnot tell me his plans till after the loss of Corfinium, and he cannot\r\ncomplain of my not going to Brundisium, when Caesar was between me and\r\nBrundisium. Besides he knows that complaint on his part is stopped.\r\nHe is of opinion that I saw clearer than he did about the weakness of\r\nthe municipal towns, the levies, peace, the city, the public funds,\r\noccupying Pisenum. If however I do not go to him, when I can, he will\r\ncertainly be angry. From that I shrink--not for fear of harm he may do\r\nme (for what can he do? And who\r\n\r\n\"Would be a slave but he who fears to die?\"[83])\r\n\r\nbut because I shrink from being charged with ingratitude. So I trust\r\nmy arrival will be, as you say, welcome to him, whenever I go. As for\r\nyour remark \"If Caesar's conduct be more temperate, you will weigh your\r\nadvice more carefully,\" how can Caesar keep himself from a destructive\r\npolicy? It is forbidden by his character, his previous career, the\r\nnature of his present enterprise, his associates, the material strength\r\nor even the moral firmness of the loyalist party.\r\n\r\n[83] From an unknown play of Euripides.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely read your letter, when up comes Curtius Postumus\r\nhurrying off to Caesar, talking of nothing but fleets and armies;\r\n\"Caesar is wresting\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 184\r\n\r\ntenebat Asiam, Siciliam, Africam, Sardiniam, confestim in Graeciam\r\npersequebatur.

But I had heard that he had gone either to Pompey\r\nor to Spain. What the fact is, I should much like to know, for it has\r\na bearing on the point I am now considering: if it is certain that\r\nDomitius has found no means of departure, Pompey may understand that my\r\nown departure from Italy is difficult, seeing that it is now beset with\r\ntroops and garrisons, and especially in the winter season. For, were it\r\na more convenient time of year, one could even cross the southern sea.\r\nNow there is no choice but the Adriatic, to which passage is barred.

Whether one is doing one's duty to the State, if one\r\nretires to some other place and there remains inactive, when there is\r\na tyranny; or whether one ought to run every risk for liberty. Whether\r\none ought to invade the country and besiege one's native town, when it\r\nis under a tyranny. Whether one ought to enrol oneself in the ranks\r\nof the loyalists, even if one does not approve of war as a means of\r\nabolishing tyranny.

Philotimus delivered it to me\r\nthe day after he got it from you. The points you discuss are very\r\ndifficult--the route to the upper sea, a voyage by the lower sea,\r\ndeparture to Arpinum, lest I should seem to have avoided Caesar,\r\nremaining at Formiae, lest I should appear to have put myself forward\r\nto congratulate him; but the most miserable thing of all will be to see\r\nwhat I tell you must very shortly be seen.\r\n\r\nCurtius Postumus was with me. I wrote you how tiresome he was. Quintus\r\nFufius also came to see me--what an air! what assurance!--hastening\r\nto Brundisium denouncing Pompey's wrong-doings and the careless folly\r\nof the House. When I cannot stand this under my own roof, how shall\r\nI be able to endure Curtius in the Senate? But suppose I put up with\r\nall this in good humour, what of the question \"Your vote, M. Tullius?\"\r\nWhat will come of it? I pass over the cause of the Republic, which I\r\nconsider lost, both from the wounds dealt it and the cures prepared for\r\nthem; but what am I to do about Pompey? It is no use denying that I am\r\ndownright angry with him. For I am always more affected by the causes\r\nof events than by the events themselves. Therefore considering our\r\nincomparable woes, or rather concluding that they have happened by his\r\ndoing and his mistakes, I am more angry with Pompey than with Caesar\r\nhimself. Just as our ancestors\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 192\r\n\r\nmaiores nostri funestiorem diem esse voluerunt Aliensis pugnae\r\nquam urbis captae, quod hoc malum ex illo (itaque alter religiosus\r\netiam nunc dies, alter in vulgus ignotus), sic ego decem annorum\r\npeccata recordans, in quibus inerat ille etiam annus, qui nos hoc\r\nnon defendente, ne dicam gravius, adflixerat, praesentisque temporis\r\ncognoscens temeritatem, ignaviam, neglegentiam suscensebam. Sed ea iam\r\nmihi exciderunt; beneficia eiusdem cogito, cogito etiam dignitatem;\r\nintellego serius equidem, quam vellem, propter epistulas sermonesque\r\nBalbi, sed video plane nihil aliud agi, nihil actum ab initio, nisi ut\r\nhunc occideret.

But all this\r\nI have forgotten. It is his kindness I think of, and I think of my own\r\nhonour too. I understand, later indeed than I could have wished, from\r\nthe letters and conversation of Balbus, but I see plainly, that the\r\nsole object is, and has been from the beginning, the death of Pompey.\r\nSo I say the same as Achilles to his mother, when she said \"For after\r\nHector's death thy doom is fixed,\" and he replied, \"Then let me die,\r\nsince I have failed to save my friend.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iliad XVIII, 96-9]\r\n\r\nAnd in my case it is not only a friend but a benefactor, a man so great\r\nand championing so great a cause. Indeed I hold that life should be\r\npaid for the kindnesses that he has done me. But in your loyal party I\r\nhave no confidence: nor I do even acknowledge any allegiance to them\r\nnow. I see how they surrender and will surrender themselves to Caesar.\r\nDo you think that those decrees of the towns about Pompey's health were\r\nanything compared with their congratulatory addresses to Caesar? You\r\nwill say, \"They are terrorized.\" Yes, but they themselves declare that\r\nthey were terrorized on the former occasion. But let us see what has\r\nhappened at Brundisium. Perhaps from that may spring different plans\r\nand a different letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 194\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nCICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr.

Ergo utar tuo\r\nconsilio neque me Arpinum hoc tempore abdam, etsi, Ciceroni meo togam\r\npuram cum dare Arpini vellem, hanc eram ipsam excusationem relicturus\r\nad Caesarem.

Tum reliqua videbimus,\r\nid est et quo et qua et quando.\r\n\r\nDomitius, ut audio, in Cosano est, et quidem, ut aiunt, paratus ad\r\nnavigandum, si in Hispaniam, non probo, si ad Gnaeum, laudo; quovis\r\npotius certe, quam ut Curtium videat, quem ego patronus aspicere\r\nnon possum.

From Rome Balbus has written that he\r\nthinks the consul Lentulus has now gone over, and that the younger\r\nBalbus has not met him, because the latter has just heard the news at\r\nCanusium and from that town has written to him. He adds that the six\r\ncohorts which were at Alba have gone to Curius by the Minucian road,\r\nthat Caesar has written to tell him so and will shortly be in Rome. So\r\nI shall follow your advice. I shall not go and bury myself in Arpinum\r\nat the present time, though, since I had wished to celebrate my son's\r\ncoming of age there, I thought of leaving that as an excuse to Caesar.\r\nBut perhaps that itself will give offence and he might ask why I should\r\nnot do it at Rome. Still, if I must meet him, I would much rather meet\r\nhim here. Then I shall see the other things, where I am to go, by what\r\nroute and when.\r\n\r\nDomitius, I hear, is at Cosa, and ready it is said to sail. If it is to\r\nSpain, I do not approve, but, if to Pompey, he has my praise. Better\r\nto go anywhere than to have to see Curtius, of whom, though I have\r\ndefended him, I cannot bear the sight, not to speak of others. But I\r\nsuppose I had better keep quiet, for fear of convicting myself of folly\r\nin managing to be cut off wholly and made captive through my love of my\r\ncountry and an idea that the matter could be patched up.\r\n\r\nJust as I had finished writing, there came a letter from Capua, of\r\nwhich this is a copy: \"Pompey has crossed the sea with all the soldiery\r\nhe has. There\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 196\r\n\r\nhominum milia triginta et consules duo et tribuni pl. et senatores, qui\r\nfuerunt cum eo, omnes cum uxoribus et liberis. Conscendisse dicitur\r\na. d. IIII Nonas Martias. Ex ea die fuere septemtriones venti. Naves,\r\nquibus usus non est, omnes aut praecidisse aut incendisse dicunt.\"\r\n\r\nDe hac re litterae L. Metello tribuno pl. Capuam allatae sunt a Clodia\r\nsocru, quae ipsa transiit. Ante sollicitus eram et angebar, sicut res\r\nscilicet ipsa cogebat, cum consilio explicare nihil possem; nunc autem,\r\npostquam Pompeius et consules ex Italia exierunt, non angor, sed ardeo\r\ndolore,\r\n\r\n                                οὐδέ μοι ἦτορ\r\n    ἔμπεδον, ἀλλ' ἀλαλύκτημαι.\r\n\r\nNon sum, inquam, mihi crede, mentis compos; tantum mihi dedecoris\r\nadmisisse videor.

He is said to have embarked\r\non the 4th of March. From that day there have been northerly winds.\r\nThey say he disabled or burned all the ships he did not use.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidennote Iliad x, 91]\r\n\r\nOn this matter a letter has been received at Capua by Lucius Metellus,\r\nthe tribune of the plebs, from Clodia, his mother-in-law, who herself\r\ncrossed the sea. I was anxious and distracted before, naturally enough\r\nunder the circumstances, when I could find no solution of affairs.\r\nBut, now that Pompey and the consuls have left Italy, I am not only\r\ndistracted, but I blaze with indignation. \"Steady my heart no more,\r\nbut wild with grief.\" Believe me, I say I am no longer responsible,\r\nso great the shame I seem to have incurred. To think that in the\r\nfirst place I should not be with Pompey, whatever his plan, nor again\r\nwith the loyalists, however rashly they have mismanaged their cause!\r\nParticularly when those very people, whose interests kept me cautious,\r\nmy wife, my daughter and the boys, preferred that I should follow\r\nPompey's fortunes, and thought Caesar's cause disgraceful and unworthy\r\nof me. As for my brother Quintus, whatever I thought right, he agreed\r\nto, and he followed my course with perfect contentment.\r\n\r\nYour letters I am reading now from the beginning of the business. They\r\nafford me some little relief. The first warn and entreat me not to\r\ncommit myself. The later ones show you are glad I stayed. While I read\r\nthem, my conduct seems to me less discreditable; but only so long as\r\nI read: afterwards up rises sorrow again and a vision of shame. So I\r\nbeseech you, Titus,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 198\r\n\r\nmihi hunc dolorem, aut minue saltem aut consolatione aut consilio, aut\r\nquacumque re potes. Quid tu autem possis? aut quid homo quisquam? Vix\r\niam deus.\r\n\r\nEquidem illud molior, quod tu mones sperasque fieri posse, ut mihi\r\nCaesar concedat, ut absim, cum aliquid in senatu contra Gnaeum agatur.\r\nSed timeo, ne non impetrem. Venit ab eo Furnius. Ut quidem scias, quos\r\nsequamur, Q. Titini filium cum Caesare esse nuntiat, sed illum maiores\r\nmihi gratias agere, quam vellem. Quid autem me roget paucis ille quidem\r\nverbis, sed ἐν δυνάμει, cognosce ex ipsius epistula. Me miserum, quod\r\ntu non valuisti! una fuissemus; consilium certe non defuisset; σύν τε\r\nδύ' ἐρχομένω----.\r\n\r\nSed acta ne agamus, reliqua paremus. Me adhuc haec duo fefellerunt,\r\ninitio spes compositionis, qua facta volebam uti populari vita,\r\nsollicitudine senectutem nostram liberari; deinde bellum crudele et\r\nexitiosum suscipi a Pompeio intellegebam. Melioris medius fidius\r\ncivis et viri putabam quovis supplicio adfici, quam illi crudelitati\r\nnon solum praeesse, verum etiam interesse. Videtur vel mori satius\r\nfuisse quam esse cum his. Ad haec igitur cogita, mi Attice, vel potius\r\nexcogita. Quemvis eventum fortius feram quam hunc dolorem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 199\r\n\r\ntake this grief away from me, or at any rate lessen it by your sympathy\r\nor advice or by any other possible means. Yet what can you or any man\r\ndo? God Himself could hardly help now.\r\n\r\nBut my own aim now is to achieve what you advise and hope, that Caesar\r\nexcuse my absence, when any measure is brought forward against Pompey\r\nin the house. But I fear I may fail. Furnius has come from Caesar. To\r\nshow you the sort of men I am following, he tells me that the son of Q.\r\nTitinius is with Caesar, but Caesar expresses greater thanks to me than\r\nI could wish. His request put in a few words, but _ex cathedra_, you\r\nmay see from his letter. How grieved I am at your ill-health! We should\r\nhave been together; assuredly advice would not have been wanting: \"Two\r\nheads are better than one.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iliad X, 224]\r\n\r\nBut let us not fight battles over again, let us attend to the future.\r\nTill now two things have led me astray, at first the hope of a\r\nsettlement, and, if that were secured, I was ready for private life and\r\nan old age quit of public cares; and then I discovered that Pompey was\r\nbeginning a bloody and destructive war. On my honour I thought that\r\nit was the part of a better man and a better citizen to suffer any\r\npunishment rather than, I will not say to take a leading part, but even\r\nto take any part in such atrocities. It seems as though it would have\r\nbeen preferable to die than to be one of such men. So, my dear Atticus,\r\nthink on these problems, or rather think them out. I shall bear any\r\nresult more bravely than this affliction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 200\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIa\r\n\r\nCAESAR IMP.

However, on that very\r\nday there arrived that \"sprinter,\" as Salvius called him, bringing\r\nyour very full epistle which has put just a drop of life into me, for\r\nrecovered I cannot profess to be. Clearly you have done the one thing\r\nneedful. Believe me I am not acting now with a view to a lucky issue;\r\nfor I see that we can never enjoy a Republic while these two men live,\r\nor this one alone. So I\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 202\r\n\r\nIta neque de otio nostro spero iam nec ullam acerbitatem recuso. Unum\r\nillud extimescebam, ne quid turpiter facerem, vel dicam iam ne fecissem.\r\n\r\nSic ergo habeto, salutares te mihi litteras misisse neque solum has\r\nlongiores, quibus nihil potest esse explicatius, nihil perfectius, sed\r\netiam illas breviores, in quibus hoc mihi iucundissimum fuit, consilium\r\nfactumque nostrum a Sexto probari, pergratumque mihi tu ...[84]\r\nfecisti; a quo et diligi me et, quid rectum sit, intellegi scio.\r\nLongior vero tua epistula non me solum, sed meos omnes aegritudine\r\nlevavit. Itaque utar tuo consilio et ero in Formiano, ne aut ad urbem\r\nἀπάντησις mea animadvertatur, aut, si nec hic nec illic eum videro,\r\ndevitatum se a me putet. Quod autem suades, ut ab eo petam, ut mihi\r\nconcedat, ut idem tribuam Pompeio, quod ipsi tribuerim, id me iam\r\npridem agere intelleges ex litteris Balbi et Oppi, quarum exempla tibi\r\nmisi. Misi etiam Caesaris ad eos sana mente scriptas quo modo in tanta\r\ninsania. Sin mihi Caesar hoc non concedat, video tibi placere illud, me\r\nπολίτευμα de pace suscipere; in quo non extimesco periculum (cum enim\r\ntot impendeant, cur non honestissimo depecisci velim?), sed vereor, ne\r\nPompeio quid oneris imponam,\r\n\r\n                μή μοι γοργείην κεφαλὴν δεινοῖο πελώρου\r\n\r\nintorqueat.

Nihil ille umquam minus\r\nobscure tulit.\r\n\r\n[84] _After_ tu _there is probably a lacuna which should be filled by\r\nsome such words as those suggested by Lehmann_: fecisti, quod me de\r\niudicio eius certiorem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 203\r\n\r\nhave no hope of ease for myself and I do not refuse to contemplate as\r\npossible any bitterness. The one thing I dread is doing, or, perhaps I\r\nshould say, having done, anything disgraceful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Odyssey xi, 663]\r\n\r\nSo please consider that your letter was good for me, and not only the\r\nlonger, most explicit and perfect epistle, but also the shorter, in\r\nwhich the most delightful thing was to find that my policy and action\r\nis approved by Sextus. You have done me a great kindness....[85] Of\r\nhis affection and sense of honour I am sure. But that longer letter of\r\nyours has relieved not only me but all my friends from our sorry state:\r\nso I will follow your advice and remain in the villa at Formiae, that\r\nmy meeting with Caesar outside the city may not excite comment, or, if\r\nI do not meet him either here or there, I may not lead him to think\r\nI have shunned him. As for your advice to ask him to allow me to pay\r\nPompey the same homage as I did to him, you will understand I have been\r\ndoing that long since, when you see the copies I forward of letters\r\nof Balbus and Oppius. I send also a letter addressed by Caesar to\r\nthem, which is sane enough considering these mad times. But, if Caesar\r\nshould refuse my request, I see that you think I should undertake to\r\nbe a peace-maker. In that rôle I do not fear danger--for, with so many\r\ndangers overhanging, why should I not compound by taking the most\r\nrespectable--but I fear lest I may embarrass Pompey, and he fix on me\r\n\"the Gorgon gaze of his dread eye.\" It is wonderful to see how Pompey\r\ndesires to imitate Sulla's reign. I know what I am saying. He has made\r\nno secret of it. Then why\r\n\r\n[85] Adopting Lehmann's suggestion \"in telling me of his opinion.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 204\r\n\r\n\"Cum hocne igitur,\" inquies, \"esse vis?\" Beneficium sequor, mihi crede,\r\nnon causam, [ut in Milone, ut in.... Sed hactenus].[86] \"Causa igitur\r\nnon bona est?\" Immo optima, sed agetur, memento, foedissime. Primum\r\nconsilium est suffocare urbem et Italiam fame, deinde agros vastare,\r\nurere, pecuniis locupletum non abstinere. Sed, cum eadem metuam ab hac\r\nparte, si illim beneficium non sit, rectius putem quidvis domi perpeti.\r\nSed ita meruisse illum de me puto, ut ἀχαριστίας crimen subire non\r\naudeam, quamquam a te eius quoque rei iusta defensio est explicata.\r\n\r\n[86] _The words in brackets are probably a gloss which has crept into\r\nthe text._\r\n\r\nDe triumpho tibi adsentior, quem quidem totum facile et lubenter\r\nabiecero.

Noli\r\nenim putare tolerabiles horum insanias nec unius modi fore. Etsi quid\r\nte horum fugit, legibus, iudicibus, iudiciis senatu sublato libidines,\r\naudacias, sumptus, egestates tot egentissimorum hominum nec privatas\r\nposse res nec rem publicam sustinere?

Believe me I follow\r\ngratitude, not a cause [and I did in the case of Milo and in.... But\r\nenough of this.] \"Then the cause is not good?\" Yes, the best in the\r\nworld; but remember it will be handled in the most disgraceful way. The\r\nfirst plan is to throttle Rome and Italy and starve them, then to lay\r\nwaste and burn the country, and not to keep hands off the riches of\r\nthe wealthy. But, since I have the same fears on Caesar's side too, if\r\nit were not for favours on the other side, I should think it better to\r\nstay in Rome and suffer what comes. But so bounden do I consider myself\r\nto Pompey that I cannot endure to risk the charge of ingratitude. But\r\nyou have said all that can be said for that course too.\r\n\r\nAbout my triumph I agree with you. I can throw it away willingly and\r\nwith ease. I am delighted with your remark that it may be, while I am\r\nconsidering, \"the chance to sail\" may arise. \"Yes,\" you say, \"if only\r\nPompey is firm enough.\" He is more firm than I imagined. In him you\r\nmay be confident. I promise you, if he succeeds, he will not leave a\r\ntile in Italy. \"Will you help him, then?\" By heaven, against my own\r\njudgement and against all the lessons of the past I desire to depart,\r\nnot so much that I may help Pompey, as that I may not see what is being\r\ndone here. For please do not think that the madness of these parties\r\nwill be endurable or of one kind. However, it is obvious to you that\r\nwhen laws, juries, courts and Senate are abolished, neither private nor\r\npublic resources will be able to bear up against the lusts, daring,\r\nextravagance and necessity of so many needy men. So let me depart on\r\nany kind of voyage: be it whatever you will, only let me depart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 206\r\n\r\nsed certe abeamus.

Posteaquam litteras communes cum Oppio ad te dedi, ab Caesare\r\nepistulam accepi, cuius exemplum\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 209\r\n\r\nwas going to do, what in our opinion he ought to do, as soon as he\r\nreaches Rome, that is to say try to effect a reconciliation with\r\nPompey, we should feel it our duty to exhort you to take part in\r\nthe negotiations, as the whole thing could most easily and with the\r\ngreatest dignity be carried through by you, who have ties with both\r\nparties. If on the contrary we thought Caesar was not going to follow\r\nthat course, and knew that he even wished to wage war with Pompey,\r\nwe should never advise you to bear arms against a man who has done\r\nyou such good service, just as we have always begged you not to\r\nfight against Caesar. But, since Caesar's intentions are still mere\r\nguesswork, we can only say that it does not seem consonant with your\r\ndignity or your well-known sense of honour to bear arms against either\r\nof them, as you are intimate with both: and we have no doubt that\r\nCaesar will be generous enough to approve of this course. If you wish\r\nit, however, we will write to Caesar to ascertain his intentions in\r\nthis matter. If he sends us an answer, we will let you know our opinion\r\nat once, and convince you that we are giving the advice which seems\r\nto us to be best for your dignity, not for Caesar's policy, and, such\r\nis Caesar's consideration for his friends, that we feel sure he will\r\napprove of such a course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIIb\r\n\r\nBALBUS TO CICERO, THE IMPERATOR, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rome, March 11 or 12_, B.C. _49_]\r\n\r\nI hope you are well.[89] After sending you a letter in conjunction with\r\nOppius I had a note from Caesar, of which I am forwarding a copy. From\r\nit you can\r\n\r\n[89] The letters _S.V.B._ stand for _si vales bene (est)_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 210\r\n\r\ntibi misi. Ex quibus perspicere poteris, quam cupiat concordiam suam\r\net Pompei reconciliare, et quam remotus sit ab omni crudelitate; quod\r\neum sentire, ut debeo, valde gaudeo. De te et tua fide et pietate\r\nidem mehercule, mi Cicero, sentio quod tu, non posse tuam famam et\r\nofficium sustinere, ut contra eum arma feras, a quo tantum beneficium\r\nte accepisse praedices. Caesarem hoc idem probaturum exploratum pro\r\nsingulari eius humanitate habeo, eique cumulatissime satis facturum te\r\ncerto scio, cum nullam partem belli contra cum suscipias neque socius\r\neius adversariis fueris. Atque hoc non solum in te, tali et tanto viro,\r\nsatis habebit, sed etiam mihi ipse sua concessit voluntate, ne in iis\r\ncastris essem, quae contra Lentulum aut Pompeium futura essent, quorum\r\nbeneficia maxima haberem, sibique satis esse dixit, si togatus urbana\r\nofficia sibi praestitissem, quae etiam illis, si vellem, praestare\r\npossem. Itaque nunc Romae omnia negotia Lentuli procuro, sustineo,\r\nmeumque officium, fidem, pietatem iis praesto. Sed mehercule rursus\r\niam abiectam compositionis spem non desperatissimam esse puto, quoniam\r\nCaesar est ea mente, quam optare debemus.\r\n\r\nHac re mihi placet, si tibi videtur, te ad eum scribere et ab eo\r\npraesidium petere, ut petiisti a Pompeio me quidem adprobante\r\ntemporibus Milonianis. Praestabo, si Caesarem bene novi, eum prius tuae\r\ndignitatis quam suae utilitatis rationem habiturum.\r\n\r\nHaec quam prudenter tibi scribam, nescio, sed illud\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 211\r\n\r\nsee how eager he is for a reconciliation between himself and Pompey,\r\nand how far removed all cruelty is from his thoughts: and I am, as in\r\nduty bound, very glad that he takes that view. As for yourself and\r\nyour honour, and loyalty to your friends, I give you my word, my dear\r\nCicero, that I think as you do, that your reputation and your duty will\r\nnot admit of your bearing arms against a man, from whom you acknowledge\r\nthat you have received such favours. I have not the slightest doubt\r\nthat Caesar with his extraordinary kindness will agree, and that you\r\nwill satisfy him abundantly, by taking no part against him in the war\r\nand not siding with his opponents. And this he will count sufficient\r\nnot only in the case of so important a personage as yourself, but even\r\nto me of his own free will he has granted the same permission not to\r\nenter a camp which would be opposed to Lentulus and Pompey, to whom I\r\nam under great obligations: and he has said he is quite satisfied, if I\r\nshould perform peaceful civic functions for him, which I am at liberty\r\nto perform for them too, if I wish. So I am acting now as Lentulus'\r\ndeputy at Rome and carrying out his business, fulfilling my duty and\r\nmaintaining my honour and loyalty to them. But really, though I had\r\ngiven up hope of peace, I am no longer in despair of it, since Caesar\r\nis in the mood in which we would wish him to be.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances I see no objection, if you think fit, to\r\nyour writing and asking for his protection, as you did for Pompey's,\r\nwith my approval, at Milo's trial. If I know anything of Caesar, I\r\nwill guarantee that he will consider your dignity more than his own\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nHow far the advice I am sending may be right, I\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 212\r\n\r\ncerte scio, me ab singulari amore ac benevolentia, quaecumque scribo,\r\ntibi scribere, quod te (ita incolumi Caesare moriar!) tanti facio, ut\r\npaucos aeque ac te caros habeam. De hac re cum aliquid constitueris,\r\nvelim mihi scribas.

Though I am ready to die for Caesar's sake, there are few\r\nthat I esteem as highly as I esteem you. When you have made up your\r\nmind on the point, I should like you to let me know, for I am much\r\nconcerned that you should be able to show your goodwill to both\r\nparties, as you desire: and I have not the faintest doubt that you\r\nwill. Take care of your health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIIc\r\n\r\nCAESAR TO OPPIUS AND CORNELIUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _On the road, shortly before 7 B._]\r\n\r\nI am very glad to hear from your letters how strongly you approve\r\nof what happened at Corfinium. I shall follow your advice with\r\npleasure--with all the more pleasure, because I had myself made up my\r\nmind to act with the greatest moderation, and to do my best to effect\r\na reconciliation with Pompey. Let us see if by moderation we can win\r\nall hearts and secure a lasting victory, since by cruelty others have\r\nbeen unable to escape from hatred and to maintain their victory for\r\nany length of time except L. Sulla, whose example I do not intend to\r\nfollow. This is a new way of conquering, to strengthen one's position\r\nby kindness and generosity. As to how this can be done, some ideas have\r\noccurred to me and many more can be found. I should like you to turn\r\nsome attention to the matter.\r\n\r\nI have taken N. Magius, a praefect of Pompey. Of course I kept to my\r\npolicy and set him free at once.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 214\r\n\r\nfeci.

Si volent grati esse, debebunt Pompeium hortari, ut\r\nmalit mihi esse amicus quam iis, qui et illi et mihi semper fuerunt\r\ninimicissimi; quorum artificiis effectum est, ut res publica in hunc\r\nstatum perveniret.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nCICERO ATTICO SAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scr. in Formiano prid.

That many members of the House are at Rome, I also\r\nhave heard. Can you give any reason why they ever left it? Here there\r\nis an idea based on guesswork rather than message or dispatch that\r\nCaesar will be at Formiae on March the 22nd. I wish I could have here\r\nHomer's Minerva disguised as Mentor, that I might say to her, \"Mentor,\r\nhow shall I go, and how shall I welcome him, pray?\" I have never had a\r\nmore difficult step to think of. But I think of it nevertheless: nor\r\nshall I be unprepared, so far as the evil days permit.

Quod laudas, quia\r\noblivisci me scripsi ante facta et delicta nostri amici, ego vero ita\r\nfacio. Quin ea ipsa, quae a te commemorantur, secus ab eo in me ipsum\r\nfacta esse non memini. Tanto plus apud me valere beneficii gratiam\r\nquam iniuriae dolorem volo. Faciamus igitur, ut censes, colligamusque\r\nnos.

They were dated the 12th,\r\n13th and 14th. So I will take the earliest first. I agree with you that\r\nit is best for me to stay at Formiae. I also agree about the Adriatic.\r\nBut as I wrote you before, I will strive to discover how I may be able\r\nwith Caesar's goodwill to keep quite clear of politics. You praise me\r\nfor saying that I forget Pompey's former misdeeds and ill-doings, but\r\nit is a fact. Nay, those very actions you call to mind, in which he did\r\nharm to me myself, have no place in my memory. I am so determined to\r\nfeel gratitude for his kindness rather than resentment for injuries.\r\nLet me act then as you decree, and pull myself together. For I\r\nphilosophize as I walk about my estate, and in my perambulations I do\r\nnot cease to ponder my themes. But some of them are very difficult to\r\ndecide. As for the loyalists, let it be as you wish. You know the old\r\nsaying \"Dionysius in Corinth.\"[93]\r\n\r\n[93] Dionysius, when expelled from the throne of Syracuse, fled to\r\nCorinth and according to some authorities set up a school there. But\r\nwhether the saying here mentioned refers merely to his exile and means\r\n\"There are ups and downs in life,\" or to his schoolmastering, as Jeans\r\nsuggests, referring to a passage in _Tusc._ III, 27, where Cicero\r\nsays Dionysius took to schoolmastering because he wished to tyrannize\r\nover somebody, is uncertain. If the latter, it would mean that the\r\n_optimates_ would ill-use Cicero again as soon as they got the power.\r\n\r\nTitinius' son is with Caesar. You seem to fear that your advice irks\r\nme; but nothing indeed pleases me except your counsel and your letters.\r\nSo do as you promise. Do not omit to write to me anything that comes\r\ninto your mind; for nothing can delight me more.\r\n\r\nI turn now to your next letter. You are right not\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 218\r\n\r\nClodia. Falsum etiam de corruptis navibus. Quod consules laudas, ego\r\nquoque animum laudo, sed consilium reprehendo; dispersu enim illorum\r\nactio de pace sublata est, quam quidem ego meditabar. Itaque postea\r\nDemetri librum de concordia tibi remisi et Philotimo dedi. Nec vero\r\ndubito, quin exitiosum bellum impendeat; cuius initium ducetur a\r\nfame. Et me tamen doleo non interesse huic bello! In quo tanta vis\r\nsceleris futura est, ut, cum parentes non alere nefarium sit, nostri\r\nprincipes antiquissimam et sanctissimam parentem, patriam, fame\r\nnecandam putent. Atque hoc non opinione timeo, sed interfui sermonibus.\r\nOmnis haec classis Alexandria, Colchis, Tyro, Sidone, Arado, Cypro,\r\nPamphylia, Lycia, Rhodo, Chio, Byzantio, Lesbo, Zmyrna, Mileto, Coo\r\nad intercludendos commeatus Italiae et ad occupandas frumentarias\r\nprovincias comparatur. At quam veniet iratus! et iis quidem maxime,\r\nqui eum maxime salvum volebant, quasi relictus ab iis, quos reliquit.\r\nItaque mihi dubitanti, quid me facere par sit, permagnum pondus adfert\r\nbenevolentia erga illum; qua dempta perire melius esset in patria quam\r\npatriam servando evertere. De septemtrione plane ita est. Metuo,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 219\r\n\r\nto believe the reports about the number of Pompey's soldiers.\r\nClodia's letter made them just double. It was untrue also about the\r\ndestruction of the vessels. You praise the consuls; so do I praise\r\ntheir courage, but I blame their policy. Their departure has destroyed\r\nthe negotiations for peace, the very thing which I was contemplating.\r\nSo after that I returned you Demetrius' book on Concord and gave it to\r\nPhilotimus. And I have no doubt a disastrous war is imminent, which\r\nwill be ushered in by famine. And here I am lamenting that I have no\r\nhand in the war, a war which will be so criminal, that though it is\r\nwicked not to support one's parents, yet our chiefs will not hesitate\r\nto destroy by starvation their country, that most reverend and holiest\r\nof parents! And my fears are not based on mere surmise. I have heard\r\ntheir talk. All this fleet from Alexandria, Colchis, Tyre, Sidon,\r\nAradus, Cyprus, Pamphylia, Lycia, Rhodes, Chius, Byzantium, Lesbos,\r\nSmyrna, Miletus, Cos, is being got ready to cut off the supplies of\r\nItaly and to blockade the grain-producing provinces. And how angry\r\nPompey will be when he comes, particularly with those who particularly\r\ndesire his safety, as if he were abandoned by those whom he has\r\nabandoned! So in my doubt what I ought to do, I am greatly swayed by my\r\ngood feeling towards Pompey. Without that it were better to perish in\r\nmy country, than to destroy my country by saving it. As to the north\r\nwind, it is clearly as you write. I fear Epirus\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 220\r\n\r\nne vexetur Epirus; sed quem tu locum Graeciae non direptum iri\r\nputas? Praedicat enim palam et militibus ostendit se largitione ipsa\r\nsuperiorem quam hunc fore. Illud me praeclare admones, cum illum\r\nvidero, ne nimis indulgenter, et ut cum gravitate potius loquar. Plane\r\nsic faciendum. Arpinum, cum eum convenero, cogito, ne forte aut absim,\r\ncum veniet, aut cursem huc illuc via deterrima. Bibulum, ut scribis,\r\naudio venisse et redisse pridie Idus.\r\n\r\nPhilotimum, ut ais in epistula tertia, exspectabas. At ille Idibus a\r\nme profectus est. Eo serius ad tuam illam epistulam, cui ego statim\r\nrescripseram, redditae sunt meae litterae. De Domitio, ut scibis,\r\nita opinor esse, ut et in Cosano sit, et consilium eius ignoretur.\r\nIste omnium turpissimus et sordidissimus, qui consularia comitia a\r\npraetore ait haberi posse, est idem, qui semper in re publica fuit.\r\nItaque nimirum hoc illud est, quod Caesar scribit in ea epistula,\r\ncuius exemplum ad te misi, se velle uti \"consilio\" meo (age, esto;\r\nhoc commune est), \"gratia\" (ineptum id quidem, sed, puto, hoc simulat\r\nad quasdam senatorum sententias), \"dignitate\" (fortasse sententiae\r\nconsularis). Illud extremum est: \"ope omnium rerum.\" Id ego suspicari\r\ncoepi tum ex tuis litteris aut hoc ipsum esse aut non multo secus. Nam\r\npermagni eius interest rem ad interregnum non venire. Id adsequitur, si\r\nper praetorem consules creantur. Nos autem in libris\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 221\r\n\r\nmay be harassed, but do you suppose there is any part of Greece that\r\nwill not be robbed? Pompey openly declares and shows his men that he\r\nwill be more liberal even than Caesar in largesse. You do well to\r\nadvise me, when I see Caesar, not to be too complacent, and to speak\r\nrather with dignity. Clearly I must do so. I am thinking of going to\r\nArpinum after I have met him; for I do not want to be absent on his\r\narrival, or to have to travel to and fro in the wretched condition of\r\nthe roads. I hear, as you write, that Bibulus came and went back on the\r\n14th.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iliad iv, 182]\r\n\r\nYou say in your third letter that you were awaiting Philotimus. He set\r\nout from me on the 15th. That was why my reply to your letter, which\r\nI wrote immediately, was late in reaching you. I think you are right\r\nabout Domitius, that he is in his place at Cosa; but what his plan\r\nis, is not known. That disgraceful mean blackguard M. Lepidus, who\r\nsays that the consular elections may be held by a praetor, is playing\r\nhis old part in politics. So that was the meaning of the passage in\r\nCaesar's letter of which I sent you a copy, that he wanted to enjoy my\r\n\"advice\" (well, that is a general expression), my \"influence\" (that\r\nis flattery, but I suppose he affects to want it with a view to the\r\nvotes of certain senators), my \"position\" (perhaps he means my vote as\r\nan ex-consul). His last phrase is \"help in every way.\" I have begun\r\nto suspect from your letter that that is the point, or something very\r\nlike it. For it is highly important to him that there should not be\r\nan interregnum. That point is attained, if consuls are created by a\r\npraetor. But in our state books it is set down that it is illegal not\r\nonly for\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 222\r\n\r\nhabemus non modo consules a praetore, sed ne praetores quidem creari\r\nius esse, idque factum esse numquam; consules eo non esse ius, quod\r\nmaius imperium a minore rogari non sit ius, praetores autem, quod ita\r\nrogentur, ut collegae consulibus sint, quorum est maius imperium.\r\nAberit non longe, quin hoc a me decerni velit neque sit contentus\r\nGalba, Scaevola, Cassio, Antonio:\r\n\r\n                      Τότε μοι χάνοι εὐρεῖα χθών!\r\n\r\nSed, quanta tempestas impendeat, vides.

Which\r\nsenators have crossed over to Pompey I will tell you as soon as I\r\nknow. You are right about the corn supply: it cannot be done without\r\ntaxation: and you have cause to fear the exorbitant demands of Pompey's\r\nassociates and a wicked war. I should much like to see my friend\r\nTrebatius, although you tell me he is in despair. Do bid him hurry,\r\nfor it will be convenient, if he comes before Caesar's arrival. As for\r\nthat estate at Lanuvium, as soon as I heard of the death of Phamea, I\r\nlonged, if the constitution was going to last, that one of my friends\r\nshould buy it, and yet I did not think of you, my best friend of all.\r\nFor I know that it is your custom to inquire in how many years you\r\nmay recoup yourself of a purchase, and the value of fixtures, and I\r\nhad seen your inventory not only at Rome but at Delos. But, though it\r\nis a pretty property, I rate it at a lower value than it was rated in\r\nMarcellinus' consulship, when I thought that, owing to the house I then\r\nhad at Antium, those little gardens would please me better and cost\r\nless than the repair of my villa at Tusculum. I wanted the property for\r\n£4,500.[95] I made an offer to that amount through a third party, when\r\nhe was putting\r\n\r\n[95] Q. = quingentis millibus, i.e. 500,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 224\r\n\r\nNoluit.

There is no news that I have heard, and all\r\nyour letters I answered yesterday. But as a sick heart not only robs\r\nme of sleep, but will not allow me even to keep awake without the\r\ngreatest pain, I have begun to write to you something or other without\r\nany definite subject, that I may have a sort of talk with you, the only\r\nthing that gives me relief.\r\n\r\nI seem to myself to have been mad from the very beginning, and the one\r\nthing that tortures me is that I did not follow Pompey like a private\r\nsoldier, when he was slipping or rather rushing to ruin. I saw he was\r\nterrified on the 17th of January: on that day I felt what he would do.\r\nSince then I have never approved his course, and he has never ceased to\r\ncommit one blunder after another. Meantime not a letter to me, nothing\r\nbut thoughts of flight. Well! Just as in love affairs men are repelled\r\nby untidiness, stupidity and indelicacy, so the ugliness of\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 226\r\n\r\navertit ab amore. Nihil enim dignum faciebat, quare eius fugae comitem\r\nme adiungerem. Nunc emergit amor, nunc desiderium ferre non possum,\r\nnunc mihi nihil libri, nihil litterae, nihil doctrina prodest. Ita\r\ndies et noctes tamquam avis illa mare prospecto, evolare cupio. Do, do\r\npoenas temeritatis meae. Etsi quae fuit illa temeritas? quid feci non\r\nconsideratissime? Si enim nihil praeter fugam quaereretur, fugissem\r\nlibentissime, sed genus belli crudelissimi et maximi, quod nondum\r\nvident homines quale futurum sit, perhorrui. Quae minae municipiis,\r\nquae nominatim viris bonis, quae denique omnibus, qui remansissent!\r\nquam crebro illud \"Sulla potuit, ego non potero?\"! Mihi autem haeserunt\r\nilla. Male Tarquinius, qui Porsenam, qui Octavium Mamilium contra\r\npatriam, impie Coriolanus, qui auxilium petiit a Volscis, recte\r\nThemistocles, qui mori maluit, nefarius Hippias, Pisistrati filius,\r\nqui in Marathonia pugna cecidit arma contra patriam ferens. At Sulla,\r\nat Marius, at Cinna recte, immo iure fortasse; sed quid eorum victoria\r\ncrudelius, quid funestius? Huius belli genus fugi, et eo magis, quod\r\ncrudeliora etiam cogitari et parari videbam. Me, quem non nulli\r\nconservatorem istius urbis, quem parentem esse dixerunt, Getarum et\r\nArmeniorum et Colchorum copias ad eam adducere? me meis civibus famem,\r\nvastitatem inferre Italiae? Hunc primum mortalem esse, deinde etiam\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 227\r\n\r\nhis flight and his carelessness have estranged my love. For he has\r\ndone nothing of a kind to induce me to share his flight. But now my\r\nold love breaks forth: now I miss him intolerably: now books, letters,\r\nphilosophy, do not help me one whit. Day and night, like that bird,[96]\r\nI gaze at the sea, and long to take flight. Sorely am I punished for my\r\nrashness. Yet what rashness was there? I acted with all deliberation.\r\nFor, if flight were his only object, I would have fled gladly enough.\r\nBut I was aghast at warfare so cruel and desperate, the upshot of which\r\nis still unknown. What threats against the country towns, against\r\nthe loyalists by name, in fact against all who should stay behind!\r\nHow frequently has he remarked \"Sulla could do it, and shall not I?\"\r\nI could not get rid of thoughts like these. It was base in Tarquin\r\nto egg on Porsena and Octavius Mamilius against his country; it was\r\nwicked in Coriolanus, to seek help from the Volscians. Themistocles\r\nwas right who preferred to die. What a dastard was Hippias, the son of\r\nPisistratus, who fell at the battle of Marathon, bearing arms against\r\nhis country! Yes, but Sulla and Marius and Cinna acted rightly, perhaps\r\none should say within their rights; but then victory brought cruelty\r\nand death. I shrank from a war of that kind, and also because I saw\r\ncruelty even greater was being planned and prepared. Was it for me,\r\nwhom some called the saviour and father of Rome, to bring against her\r\nhordes of Getae, Armenians and Colchians? Was it for me to bring famine\r\non my fellow-townsmen and devastation on Italy? In the first place I\r\nreflected that Caesar was\r\n\r\n[96] Cf. Plato, _Ep._ vii, 348A, καθάπερ ὄρνις ποθῶν ποθὲν ἀναπτᾶσθαι\r\n\"Like a bird longing to fly somewhither.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 228\r\n\r\nmultis modis posse exstingui cogitabam, urbem autem et populum nostrum\r\nservandum ad immortalitatem, quantum in nobis esset, putabam, et tamen\r\nspes quaedam me oblectabat fore ut aliquid conveniret, potius quam aut\r\nhic tantum sceleris aut ille tantum flagitii admitteret.\r\n\r\nAlia res nunc tota est, alia mens mea. Sol, ut est in tua quadam\r\nepistula, excidisse mihi e mundo videtur. Ut aegroto, dum anima est,\r\nspes esse dicitur, sic ego, quoad Pompeius in Italia fuit, sperare non\r\ndestiti. Haec, haec me fefellerunt, et, ut verum loquar, aetas iam a\r\ndiuturnis laboribus devexa ad otium domesticarum me rerum delectatione\r\nmollivit. Nunc, si vel periculose experiundum erit, experiar certe,\r\nut hinc avolem. Ante oportuit fortasse; sed ea, quae scripsisti, me\r\ntardarunt, et auctoritas maxime tua. Nam, cum ad hunc locum venissem,\r\nevolvi volumen epistularum tuarum, quod ego sub signo habeo servoque\r\ndiligentissime. Erat igitur in ea, quam X K. Febr. dederas, hoc modo:\r\n\"Sed videamus, et Gnaeus quid agat, et illius rationes quorsum fluant.\r\nQuodsi iste Italiam relinquet, faciet omnino male, et, ut ego existimo,\r\nἀλογίστως, sed tum demum consilia nostra commutanda erunt.\" Hoc scribis\r\npost diem quartum, quam ab urbe discessimus. Deinde VIII K. Febr.:\r\n\"Tantum modo Gnaeus noster ne, ut urbem ἀλογίστως reliquit, sic Italiam\r\nrelinquat.\" Eodem die das alteras litteras, quibus mihi consulenti\r\nplanissime respondes. Est enim sic: \"Sed venio ad consultationem tuam.\r\nSi Gnaeus Italia cedit, in urbem redeundum puto; quae enim finis\r\nperegrinationis?\" Hoc mihi\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 229\r\n\r\nmortal, and besides might be got rid of in many ways. But I thought\r\nthat our city and our people should be preserved so far as in us lay\r\nfor immortality; and anyhow I cherished a hope that some arrangement\r\nmight be made before Caesar perpetrated such a crime or Pompey such\r\niniquity.\r\n\r\nNow the case is altered and my mind is altered too. The sun, as you\r\nsay in one of your letters, seems to me to have fallen out of the\r\nuniverse. As a sick man is said to have hope, so long as he has breath,\r\nso I did not cease to hope so long as Pompey was in Italy. This, this\r\nwas what deceived me, and to speak the truth after my long labours my\r\nlife's evening falling peacefully has made me lazy with the thought of\r\ndomestic pleasures. But now, even if risk must be run in fleeing hence,\r\nassuredly I will run it. Perhaps I ought to have done it before: but\r\nthe points you wrote about delayed me, and especially your influence.\r\nFor, when I got so far, I opened the packet of your letters, which\r\nI keep under seal and preserve with the greatest care. In a letter\r\ndated the 21st of January, you make the following remark: \"Let us see\r\nPompey's policy and the drift of his plans. Now if he leave Italy, it\r\nwill be wrong and to my mind irrational: but then and not till then\r\nwill be the time to change our plans.\" This you wrote on the fourth day\r\nafter I left Rome. Then on the 23rd of January: \"I only pray that our\r\nfriend Pompey will not leave Italy, as he has irrationally left Rome.\"\r\nOn the same day you wrote another letter, a frank reply to my request\r\nfor advice. It runs: \"But to answer the question on which you ask\r\nadvice, if Pompey leaves Italy, I think you ought to return to Rome:\r\nfor what can be the end to his\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 230\r\n\r\nplane haesit, et nunc ita video, infinitum bellum iunctum miserrima\r\nfuga, quam tu peregrinationem ὑποκορίζη. Sequitur χρησμὸς VI K.\r\nFebruarias: \"Ego, si Pompeius manet in Italia, nec res ad pactionem\r\nvenit, longius bellum puto fore; sin Italiam relinquit, ad posterum\r\nbellum ἄσπονδον strui existimo.\" Huius igitur belli ego particeps et\r\nsocius et adiutor esse cogor, quod et ἄσπονδον est et cum civibus?\r\nDeinde VII Idus Febr., cum iam plura audires de Pompei consilio,\r\nconcludis epistulam quandam hoc modo: \"Ego quidem tibi non sim\r\nauctor, si Pompeius Italiam relinquit, te quoque profugere. Summo\r\nenim periculo facies nec rei publicae proderis; cui quidem posterius\r\npoteris prodesse, si manseris.\" Quem φιλόπατριν ac πολιτικὸν hominis\r\nprudentis et amici tali admonitu non moveret auctoritas? Deinceps III\r\nIdus Febr. iterum mihi respondes consulenti sic: \"Quod quaeris a me,\r\nfugamne[97] defendam an moram utiliorem putem, ego vero in praesentia\r\nsubitum discessum et praecipitem profectionem cum tibi tum ipsi Gnaeo\r\ninutilem et periculosam puto, et satius esse existimo vos dispertitos\r\net in speculis esse; sed medius fidius turpe nobis puto esse de\r\nfuga cogitare.\" Hoc turpe Gnaeus noster biennio ante cogitavit. Ita\r\nsullaturit animus eius et proscripturit iam diu. Inde, ut opinor, cum\r\ntu ad me quaedam γενικώτερον scripsisses, et ego mihi a te significari\r\nputassem, ut Italia cederem, detestaris hoc diligenter XI K. Mart.:\r\n\"Ego vero nulla epistula significavi, si Gnaeus Italia cederet, ut tu\r\nuna cederes, aut, si significavi, non dico fui inconstans,\r\n\r\n[97] fugamne--putem, as _Otto Müller: M reads_ fugamne fidam (_corr.\r\nfrom_ fedam) an moram defendam utiliorem putem. _Other suggested\r\nemendations are_ fugamne suadeam an moram defendam utilioremque\r\nputem _(Klotz), and_ fugamne foedam an moram desidem utiliorem putem\r\n(_Manutius_).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 231\r\n\r\nwanderings?\" This gave me pause, and I see now endless war is attached\r\nto that wretched flight, which you playfully called \"wandering.\" There\r\nfollows your prophecy of the 25th of January: \"If Pompey stays in Italy\r\nand no arrangement is reached, I fancy there will be a very long war.\r\nIf he leaves Italy, I think that for the future there will be war _à\r\nl'outrance_.\" In this war then _à l'outrance_, this civil war, am I\r\nforced to take part and lot and share? Next on the 7th of February,\r\nwhen you had heard more of Pompey's plans, you end a letter as follows:\r\n\"I would not advise you to flee, if Pompey leaves Italy. You will run\r\na very great risk, and will not help the country, which you may be\r\nable to help hereafter, if you remain.\" What patriot and politician\r\nwould not be influenced by such advice from a wise man and a friend?\r\nNext on the 11th of February you answer my request for counsel again\r\nas follows: \"You ask me whether I hold that flight or delay is more\r\nuseful. Well, I think that at the present juncture a sudden departure\r\nand hasty journey would be useless and dangerous both to yourself and\r\nto Pompey, and that it were better for you to be apart, and each on\r\nhis own watch tower. But upon my honour I hold it disgraceful of us to\r\nthink of flight.\" This disgrace our Pompey meditated two years ago: so\r\nlong has he been eager to play at Sulla and proscriptions. Then, as\r\nI fancy, when you had written to me in more general terms and I had\r\nthought that some of your remarks hinted at my departure from Italy,\r\nyou protest emphatically against it on the 19th of February: \"In no\r\nletter have I hinted that you should accompany Pompey, if he leaves\r\nItaly, or, if I did hint it, I was worse than inconsistent, I was mad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 232\r\n\r\nsed demens.\" In eadem epistula alio loco: \"Nihil relinquitur nisi\r\nfuga; cui te socium neutiquam puto esse oportere nec umquam putavi.\"\r\nTotam autem hanc deliberationem evolvis accuratius in litteris VIII\r\nKal. Mart. datis: \"Si M'. Lepidus et L. Volcacius remanent, manendum\r\nputo, ita ut, si salvus sit Pompeius et constiterit alicubi, hanc\r\nνέκυιαν relinquas et te in certamine vinci cum illo facilius patiaris\r\nquam cum hoc in ea, quae perspicitur futura, colluvie regnare.\" Multa\r\ndisputas huic sententiae convenientia. Inde ad extremum: \"Quid, si,\r\ninquis\", \"Lepidus et Volcacius discedunt? Plane ἀπορῶ. Quod evenerit\r\nigitur, et quod egeris, id στερκτέον putabo.\" Si tum dubitaras, nunc\r\ncerte non dubitas istis manentibus. Deinde in ipsa fuga V Kal.

Postea, si opus fuerit, non erit difficile, et\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 233\r\n\r\nIn the same letter there is another passage: \"Nothing is left for\r\nPompey but flight, in which I do not think and never have thought that\r\nyou should share.\" This counsel you unroll in detail in your letter\r\ndated the 22nd of February: \"If M'. Lepidus and L. Volcacius stay, I\r\nthink you should stay, provided, if Pompey wins safety and makes a\r\nstand anywhere, you should leave these _âmes damnées_, and rather share\r\ndefeat with him than share Caesar's sovereignty in the mire that will\r\nbe.\" You argue at length in support of this view, then at the end you\r\nsay: \"What if Lepidus and Volcacius depart? I am quite at a loss. So I\r\nshall think you must face the event and abide by what you have done.\"\r\nIf you had any doubt then, you certainly have no doubt left now, as\r\nthose two persons remain in Italy. Next, when the flight was actually\r\nmade on Feb. 25: \"Meantime I have no doubt you should stay at Formiae.\r\nIt will be most convenient there to await the event.\" On the 1st of\r\nMarch, when Pompey had been four days at Brundisium: \"Then we shall\r\nbe able to debate, not indeed with a free hand but assuredly less\r\nhampered, than if you had shared his plunge.\" Next on the 4th of March,\r\nthough you scribbled a line on the eve of your fever bout, nevertheless\r\nyou say this: \"I will write more to-morrow, and answer all your\r\nquestions. But I maintain this, that I am not sorry for advising you\r\nto stay, and, though very anxious, still, because I fancy it is better\r\nthan flight, I stick to my opinion and am glad that you have stayed\r\nin Italy.\" When I was already tortured with fear that my conduct was\r\ndisgraceful on the 5th of March you write: \"However I am not sorry that\r\nyou are not with Pompey. Hereafter, if need arise, it will be easy,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 234\r\n\r\nilli, quoquo tempore fiet, erit ἀσμενιστόν.

Inventus est vix in hortis suis\r\nse occultans litterasque mihi remisit mirifice gratias agens Caesari;\r\nde suo autem consilio C. Caesio mandata ad me dedisse. Eum ego hodie\r\nexspectabam, id est XIII K.

When I say this, it is\r\nwith the reservation, that, if Caesar continues, as he has begun,\r\nacting with good faith, moderation and prudence, I must thoroughly\r\nreview the matter and consider more closely what our interests advise.\"\r\nOn the 9th of March you write that my friend Peducaeus too approves my\r\ninaction: and his authority has much weight with me. From these lines\r\nof yours I console myself with the reflection that so far I have done\r\nnothing wrong: but pray support your position. So far as I am concerned\r\nthere is no need: but I want others to be my accomplices. If I have not\r\ndone wrong so far, I will take care of the future. Do you maintain your\r\nexhortations and assist me with your reflections. Here nothing as yet\r\nhas been heard about Caesar's return. For myself I have won thus much\r\ngood by my letter, I have read all yours and found rest in the act.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nCICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Formiae, March 20_, B.C. _49_]\r\n\r\nDo you know that our friend Lentulus is at Puteoli? I heard this from\r\na passer-by, who declared he recognized him on the Appian road as he\r\ndrew aside the curtains of his litter, and, though it seemed hardly\r\nprobable, I sent servants to Puteoli to track him and hand him a\r\nletter. He was found with difficulty concealing himself on his estate,\r\nand returned me a letter in which he expressed amazing gratitude to\r\nCaesar. But about his own plans he said he had sent me a message by C.\r\nCaesius. I expect him to-day, the 20th of March.\r\n\r\nMatius also came to me on the 19th of March.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 236\r\n\r\nmehercule, ut mihi visus est, temperatus et prudens; existimatus\r\nquidem est semper auctor otii. Quam ille hoc non probare mihi quidem\r\nvisus est, quam illam νέκυιαν, ut tu appellas, timere! Huic ego in\r\nmulto sermone epistulam ad me Caesaris ostendi, eam cuius exemplum ad\r\nte antea misi, rogavique, ut interpretaretur, quid esset, quod ille\r\nscriberet, \"consilio meo se uti velle, gratia, dignitate, ope rerum\r\nomnium.\" Respondit se non dubitare, quin et opem et gratiam meam ille\r\nad pacificationem quaereret. Utinam aliquod in hac miseria rei publicae\r\nπολιτικὸν opus efficere et navare mihi liceat! Matius quidem et illum\r\nin ea sententia esse confidebat et se auctorem fore pollicebatur.\r\n\r\nPridie autem apud me Crassipes fuerat, qui se pridie Non. Martias\r\nBrundisio profectum atque ibi Pompeium reliquisse dicebat, quod etiam,\r\nqui viii Idus illinc profecti erant, nuntiabant; illa vero omnes,\r\nin quibus etiam Crassipes, qui pro sua prudentia potuit attendere,\r\nsermones minaces, inimicos optimatium, municipiorum hostes, meras\r\nproscriptiones, meros Sullas; quae Lucceium loqui, quae totam Graeciam,\r\nquae vero Theophanem! Et tamen omnis spes salutis in illis est, et ego\r\nexcubo animo nec partem ullam capio quietis et, ut has pestes effugiam,\r\ncum dissimillimis nostri esse cupio! Quid enim tu illic Scipionem, quid\r\nFaustum, quid Libonem praetermissurum sceleris putas, quorum creditores\r\nconvenire dicuntur? quid eos autem, cum vicerint, in cives effecturos?\r\nquam vero μικροψυχίαν Gnaei nostri esse? Nuntiant Aegyptum et Arabiam\r\nεὐδαίμονα et Μεσοποταμίαν\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 237\r\n\r\nHe seemed to me, I do declare, moderate and sensible: certainly he\r\nhas always been thought to be in favour of peace. How he disliked\r\nthis present pass! How he seemed to fear these _âmes damnées_, as you\r\ncall them! In the course of a long talk I showed him Caesar's letter\r\nto me, of which I sent you a copy before, and I asked him to explain\r\nwhat Caesar meant by writing that he wished \"to take advantage of my\r\nadvice, my influence, my position and my help of all sorts.\" Matius\r\nreplied that undoubtedly Caesar wanted my help and influence to make\r\npeace. Would that I could succeed in carrying through some political\r\ncompromise in this miserable state of affairs! Matius himself declared\r\nthat Caesar had that feeling, and promised that he would help such a\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nHowever the day before Crassipes had been with me, and he said that\r\nhe had quitted Brundisium on the 6th of March and left Pompey there;\r\nthe same tale was brought by those who quitted the place on the 8th.\r\nAll of them, and among the rest Crassipes, who was quite capable of\r\nobserving what was going on, had the same story, threatening words,\r\nbreach with the loyalists, hostility to the municipalities, nothing but\r\nproscriptions, nothing but Sullas. How Lucceius talked, all the Greeks\r\nand Theophanes too! Nevertheless the only hope of safety lies in them,\r\nand I am on the watch and take no rest and long to be with the most\r\nuncongenial associates to escape the plague here. For what crime do\r\nyou think that Scipio will stick at, or Faustus and Libo, when their\r\ncreditors are said to be selling them up, and what do you suppose they\r\nwill do to the citizens when they win? How pusillanimous Pompey is!\r\nThey say that he is thinking of Egypt and Arabia Felix and Mesopotamia\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 238\r\n\r\ncogitare, iam Hispaniam abiecisse.

If that is\r\nthe case, and if you are touched by the desire to protect our friend\r\nPompey and reconcile him to yourself and the State, I am sure you\r\nwill find no one more suited for the purpose than I am. I have always\r\nadvocated peace both with Pompey and the Senate ever since I have been\r\nable to do so, nor since the outbreak of hostilities have I taken any\r\npart in the war; I have considered that the war was attacking your\r\nrights in that envious and hostile persons were opposing a distinction\r\nconferred on you by the grace of the Roman people. But, as at that time\r\nI not only upheld your rights but urged others to assist you, so now I\r\nam greatly concerned with the rights of Pompey.

In\r\nEpirum vero invitatio quam suavis, quam liberalis, quam fraterna!\r\n\r\nDe Dionysio sum admiratus, qui apud me honoratior fuit quam apud\r\nScipionem Panaetius; a quo impurissime haec nostra fortuna despecta\r\nest. Odi hominem et odero; utinam ulcisci possem! Sed illum ulciscentur\r\nmores sui.\r\n\r\nTu, quaeso, nunc vel maxime, quid agendum nobis sit, cogita. Populi\r\nRomani exercitus Cn. Pompeium circumsedet, fossa et vallo saeptum\r\ntenet, fuga prohibet; nos vivimus, et stat urbs ista, praetores ius\r\ndicunt, aediles ludos parant; viri boni usuras perscribunt, ego ipse\r\nsedeo! Coner illuc ire ut insanus, implorare fidem municipiorum?\r\nBoni non sequentur, leves irridebunt, rerum novarum cupidi, victores\r\npraesertim et armati, vim et manus adferent. Quid censes igitur?\r\necquidnam est tui consilii ad finem huius miserrimae vitae? Nunc doleo,\r\nnunc torqueor, cum cuidam aut sapiens videor, quod una non ierim, aut\r\nfelix fuisse. Mihi contra. Numquam enim illius victoriae socius esse\r\nvolui, calamitatis mallem fuisse. Quid ego nunc tuas litteras, quid\r\ntuam prudentiam aut benevolentiam implorem?

It\r\nwas equally honourable and prudent. Your invitation, too, to Epirus,\r\nhow kind and generous and brotherly it is!\r\n\r\n[100] Q. Mucius Scaevola was murdered in 82 B.C. by the order of the\r\nyounger Marius. Cf. viii, 3.\r\n\r\nAs for Dionysius, I am surprised. I held him in greater honour than\r\nScipio held Panaetius, yet he has most foully mocked at my bad\r\nfortunes. I hate the fellow and I always shall. I wish I could pay him\r\nout. But his own character will do that.\r\n\r\nI beseech you now give the greatest consideration to my proper course.\r\nAn army of the Roman people invests Gnaeus Pompey. It holds him hedged\r\nby trench and mound and keeps him from flight. Yet we live and Rome is\r\nstanding, the praetors preside in court, the aediles make preparations\r\nfor the games, the conservatives are booking their profits, and I sit\r\nstill! Am I to try to cross the sea like a madman, to beg the country\r\ntowns to be loyal? The loyalists will not follow me, the irresponsible\r\nwill deride me, the revolutionaries, especially now they are armed and\r\nvictorious, will lay hands of violence upon me. What do you think then?\r\nHave you any plan to end this life of misery? Now I feel grief, now I\r\nam in agony, when somebody thinks me wise because I did not go with\r\nPompey, or lucky perhaps. I think the opposite. For never did I wish\r\nto share a victory of his; I should have wished rather to share his\r\ndefeat. Why should I entreat a letter from you now, your kindness, your\r\ngood sense? It is all over.

For why\r\nshould Dolabella in a letter dated from Brundisium on the 13th of\r\nMarch call it a kind of windfall for Caesar that Pompey is thinking of\r\nflight and preparing to sail by the first wind? That is very different\r\nfrom that letter of which I sent you a copy before. Here indeed every\r\none speaks of sheer disaster; but there is no later nor more reliable\r\nauthority on the event than Dolabella.\r\n\r\n[101] The first line of the palinode of Stesichorus in which he\r\nretracted his former views on Helen.\r\n\r\nI have your letter of the 22nd of March, in which you postpone all\r\nadvice till we know what has happened. Certainly that is wise; and in\r\nthe meantime we cannot think of anything, much less arrange anything.\r\nHowever, Dolabella's letter compels me to turn to my former thoughts.\r\nFor on the 18th of March the weather was excellent and I fancy Pompey\r\nwill not have failed to take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nThat précis of your advice was not made by me to quarrel with you, but\r\nto console myself, for I suffered less pain from these evil days than\r\nfrom the idea I had acted wrongly and rashly. But I fancy I have not\r\ndone so, since my deeds and policy agree with your advice. You say that\r\nI seem to owe Pompey so much more because I say so than because he\r\ndeserves it. You are right.

Quae si maxime\r\nmeminissem, tamen illius temporis similitudinem iam sequi deberem.\r\nNihil me adiuvit, cum posset; sed postea fuit amicus, etiam valde,\r\nnec, quam ob causam, plane scio. Ergo ego quoque illi. Quin etiam\r\nillud par in utroque nostrum, quod ab eisdem illecti sumus. Sed utinam\r\ntantum ego ei prodesse potuissem, quantum mihi ille potuit! Mihi tamen,\r\nquod fecit, gratissimum. Nec ego nunc, eum iuvare qua re possim,\r\nscio nec, si possem, cum tam pestiferum bellum pararet, adiuvandum\r\nputarem. Tantum offendere animum eius hic manens nolo, nec mehercule\r\nista videre, quae tu potes iam animo providere, nec interesse istis\r\nmalis possem. Sed eo tardior ad discedendum fui, quod difficile est de\r\ndiscessu voluntario sine ulla spe reditus cogitare.

However\r\nmuch I remembered it, I should feel bound to take the course he took\r\nas an example for my behaviour now. He failed to help me when he\r\nmight; but afterwards he was my friend, my very good friend. I don't\r\nquite know why; so I too will be his friend. There is this further\r\nlikeness between the two cases; both of us were inveigled by the same\r\npersons. But would that I were able to help him as much as he was\r\nable to help me! However, I am truly grateful for what he did. I do\r\nnot know in what way I may be able to help him now; nor, were I able,\r\nshould I think it proper to help him in his preparations for such a\r\ndisastrous war. Only I do not wish to hurt his feelings by staying\r\nhere. I declare I could not behold the days that you can foresee, nor\r\ntake part in such iniquity. But my departure was delayed, because\r\nit is hard to think of voluntary departure when there is no hope of\r\nreturn. For Caesar I see is so equipped with infantry, cavalry, fleet,\r\nauxiliaries from Gaul--Matius may have exaggerated, but certainly\r\nhe said that ... infantry and cavalry have promised their services\r\nfor ten years at their own expense. However, granted that this was\r\n_gasconnade_, great forces Caesar assuredly has, and he will have not\r\nthe inland revenue of Italy, but the property of her citizens. Add to\r\nthis the self-confidence of the man, the weakness of the loyalists,\r\nwho, thinking Pompey deservedly angry with them, as you say, detest the\r\ngame. I wish you had cited your authority. Domitius, who promised more\r\nthan he performed,[104] and Pompey's old lovers in general do\r\n\r\n[104] Or as Boot, reading _sedet_, \"Domitius, who etc., is doing\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 248\r\n\r\nmunicipia vero et rustici Romani illum metuunt, hunc adhuc diligunt.\r\nQuare ita paratus est, ut, etiamsi vincere non possit, quo modo tamen\r\nvinci ipse possit, non videam.

The towns and rural population are afraid of Pompey and\r\nso far worship Caesar. Caesar is so equipped that, even if he fail\r\nto beat, I do not see in what way he can be beaten. I do not fear\r\nhis _finesse_ so much as his _force majeure_, for as Plato says, \"a\r\ntyrant's requests partake of the nature of mandates.\"[105]\r\n\r\n[105] Plato, _Ep._ 7.\r\n\r\nPlaces without harbours, I see, do not meet with your approval. Nor do\r\nI like them, but the place has afforded me hiding and a trusty set of\r\nattendants. If I could have had the same at Brundisium, I should have\r\npreferred it. But there is no hiding place there. But, as you say, when\r\nwe know!\r\n\r\nI am not going to excuse myself much to the loyalists. What dinners\r\naccording to Sextus they are giving and receiving, how lavish and how\r\nearly! They may be loyal, but they are not more loyal than I. They\r\nwould influence me more if they had shown more courage.\r\n\r\nI was wrong about Phamea's estate at Lanuvium. I was dreaming about\r\nthe Trojan estate.[106] I wanted it for £4,500,[107] but the price is\r\nhigher. However, I should have liked you to buy that estate for me, if\r\nI saw any hope of enjoying it.\r\n\r\n[106] Apparently near Antium, cf. ix, 9.\r\n\r\n[107] 500,000 sesterces.\r\n\r\nWhat portentous news I read daily you may understand from the pamphlet\r\nenclosed in this packet. Lentulus is at Puteoli, and, Caesius says, in\r\na quandary what to do. He dreads a fiasco like that at Corfinium. He\r\nthinks he has done his duty by Pompey. He is influenced by Caesar's\r\nkindness; but he is influenced more by future prospects.\r\n\r\nTo think that you can bear this!

Then that very day from Capua I got a letter\r\nfrom Q. Pedius saying that Caesar had written to him on the 14th in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n\"Pompey confines himself to the town. My camp is at the gates. I am\r\nattempting a big job which will take many days on account of the depth\r\nof the sea: yet I have no better course.

Could anything be more bitter, more cruel? Moreover some one\r\ntold me with authority that Caesar said in conversation he was the\r\navenger of Cn. Carbo, M. Brutus,[109] and all those on whom Sulla with\r\nPompey to help him wreaked his cruelty: Curio under his leadership was\r\ndoing nothing but what Pompey had done under Sulla's leadership: what\r\nhe wanted was the restoration of those not punished with exile under\r\nthe earlier laws, while Pompey had restored those who had\r\n\r\n[109] Carbo was put to death by Pompey in 82 or 81 B.C.; he was consul\r\nfor the third time with C.

This tale was told me\r\nby one Baebius, who came from Curio on the 13th, a man who is no fool,\r\nbut not smart enough to invent such a tale. I am quite at a loss what\r\nto do. From Brundisium, I fancy Pompey must have set out. Whatever has\r\nhappened, we shall know in a few days. I haven't a letter from you not\r\neven by Anteros, and no wonder. What is there to write about? Still I\r\ndo not omit one day.\r\n\r\nWhen this was written a letter came to me before daylight from Lepta\r\ndated Capua the 15th of March. Pompey has embarked from Brundisium.\r\nCaesar is due at Capua on the 26th.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nCICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Formiae, March 25_, B.C. _49_]\r\n\r\nAfter I had sent you a letter informing you that Caesar would be at\r\nCapua on the 26th, a letter reached me from Capua saying that Caesar\r\nwould see me either here or in Curio's place at Alba on the 28th.\r\nWhen I have seen him, I shall go to Arpinum. If he should grant me\r\nthe privilege I ask, I shall put up with his terms. If not, then I\r\nshall consult myself as to what to do. As Caesar wrote to me, he has\r\nstationed one legion each at Brundisium, Tarentum and Sipontum. He\r\nseems to me to be cutting off retreat by sea and yet himself to have\r\nGreece in view rather than Spain. But these are remote considerations.\r\nNow I am stirred by the thought of meeting him; for the meeting is\r\nclose at hand, and I am alarmed at the first steps he\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 256\r\n\r\nhorreo. Volet enim, credo, S. C. facere, volet augurum decretum\r\n(rapiemur aut absentes vexabimur), vel ut consules roget praetor vel\r\nut dictatorem dicat; quorum neutrum ius est. Etsi, si Sulla potuit\r\nefficere, ab interrege ut dictator diceretur[112] cur hic non possit?\r\nNihil expedio, nisi ut aut ab hoc tamquam Q. Mucius aut ab illo tamquam\r\nL.

Though, if Sulla could\r\narrange to be named dictator by an interrex, why should not Caesar? I\r\ncan see no solution of the problem except by meeting the fate of Mucius\r\nat the hand of Caesar, or that of Scipio[113] at the hands of Pompey.\r\n\r\n[113] L. Scipio was proscribed by Sulla. For Mucius cf. VIII, 3.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Odyssey iii. 27]\r\n\r\nWhen you read this, perhaps I shall have met the man. \"Endure.\" My\r\nown exile was no \"unkinder cut\";[114] for I had prospects of speedy\r\nreturn and was consoled by the popular outcry. Now I long to go away\r\nand it never strikes me that there is any chance of return. Not only\r\nis there no outcry of any in town or country, but on the contrary all\r\nare afraid of Pompey as cruel in his anger. Nothing causes me more\r\nwretchedness than my having remained, and there is nothing that I want\r\nmore than to flee to him to share not his fighting but his flight. But\r\nnow what becomes of your counsel to put off decision till we knew how\r\nthings went at Brundisium? We do know, but are as badly stuck as ever.\r\nI can scarcely hope that Caesar will give me privilege, though many\r\nare the good reasons I can bring for granting it. But I will send you\r\nimmediately a report of our conversation word for word. Use all your\r\naffection to help me with your careful advise. He is coming so fast\r\nthat I cannot see even T.

The demands Caesar sent to Pompey and\r\nthe consuls, for which you ask, are not with me. The copies that were\r\nbrought I sent on to you at once.[116] From them I think you can gather\r\nwhat those demands were. Philippus is at Naples. Lentulus at Puteoli.\r\nAs to Domitius, go on inquiring where he is and what he intends to do.\r\n\r\n[116] This doubtful passage probably refers to the document mentioned\r\nin vii, 17.\r\n\r\nYou write that my remarks about Dionysius are more bitter than suits my\r\ncharacter. See how old-fashioned I am. Upon my honour I thought that\r\nyou would be more angered than I: for, apart from the fact that I think\r\nyou should be stirred by any injury done by anyone to me, this man in a\r\nway outraged you in treating me so badly. But it is for you to decide\r\nwhat weight you should give to the matter. I will not put anything upon\r\nyou. I always thought the fellow was not quite sane: now I think he is\r\nan abandoned blackguard. But he is as much his own enemy as mine. You\r\ndid well with Philargyrus. You certainly had a good and true case in\r\ncontending that I had not abandoned but rather had been abandoned.\r\n\r\nWhen I had dispatched my letter on the 25th, the servants I had sent to\r\nMatius and Trebatius brought me a letter in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"MATIUS AND TREBATIUS TO CICERO IMPERATOR,\r\n                               GREETING.\r\n\r\n\"After leaving Capua we heard on the way that Pompey with all the\r\nforces he had set out from\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 260\r\n\r\ncopiis, quas habuit, profectum esse; Caesarem postero die in oppidum\r\nintroisse, contionatum esse, inde Romam contendisse, velle ante K.\r\nesse ad urbem et pauculos dies ibi commorari, deinde in Hispanias\r\nproficisci.

I spoke so as to gain Caesar's\r\nrespect rather than his gratitude; and I persisted in my resolve not to\r\ngo to Rome. We were mistaken in thinking he would be easy to manage. I\r\nhave never seen anyone less easy. He kept on saying that my decision\r\nwas a slur on him, and that others would be less likely to come, if I\r\ndid not come. I pointed out that my case was very unlike theirs. After\r\nmuch talk he said, \"Well, come and discuss peace.\" \"On my own terms?\"\r\nI asked. \"Need I dictate to you?\" said he. \"Well,\" said I, \"I shall\r\ncontend that the Senate cannot sanction your invasion of Spain or your\r\ngoing with an army into Greece, and,\" I added, \"I shall lament Pompey's\r\nfate.\" He replied, \"That is not what I want.\" \"So I fancied,\" said I:\r\n\"but I do not want to be in Rome, because either I must say that and\r\nmuch else, on which I cannot keep silent, if I am present, or else I\r\ncannot come.\" The upshot was that I was to think over the matter, as\r\nCaesar suggested, with a view to closing our interview.

Levies\r\nare being made; troops are being drafted into winter quarters.

I knew every one of them, but I had never seen the\r\nwhole collection together.\r\n\r\nLet us go then whither we please, and leave our all behind. Let us set\r\nout to Pompey, who will be more gratified at our arrival than if we\r\nhad been with him all along. For then we had great hopes; but now I\r\nat least have none: nor has anyone except myself departed from Italy,\r\nunless he imagines Caesar to be his enemy. Heaven be my witness I do\r\nnot take this step for the sake of the Republic, which to my mind is\r\nutterly destroyed, but for fear I may be charged with ingratitude\r\nto one who relieved me from the inconveniences which he himself had\r\ninflicted: and, at the same time, because I cannot endure the sight\r\nof the horrors that are happening and are bound to happen. Moreover\r\nI fancy that now decrees of the Senate have been passed, and my only\r\nhope is that they will agree with Volcacius' proposal. But what does\r\nit matter? There is only one proposal for everybody. But the most\r\nimplacable enemy will be Servius, who has sent his son with Pontius\r\nTitinianus to destroy or at least to capture Gnaeus Pompey. Though\r\nTitinianus has the excuse of fear, what excuse has Servius?

I shall certainly neglect the law of Solon, your countryman,\r\nand I imagine mine too soon, who provided the death penalty for\r\nanyone who should not take one side in a revolution, and, unless you\r\nadvise otherwise, I shall keep apart both from Caesar and Pompey. The\r\nformer course is quite certain: but I shall not forestall events. I\r\nshall await your advice and the letter which I asked you to give to\r\nCephalio--unless you have now sent another.\r\n\r\nYou write, not on the authority of anyone, but as your own idea,\r\nthat I shall be drawn into any negotiations there may be for peace.\r\nI cannot imagine that there can be such negotiations, since it is\r\nCaesar's positive determination to rob Pompey, if possible, of army and\r\nprovince, unless perhaps that hireling can induce him to keep quiet,\r\npending the passage to and fro of intermediaries. I see nothing that\r\nI can hope for or even imagine is likely to happen. However this is\r\nthe very question for an honest man to decide and one of the great\r\nquestions of _la haute politique_, whether one may enter the council\r\nof a tyrant, if the subject of debate is good. Therefore, if anything\r\nshould happen to cause me to be summoned--I don't in the least expect\r\nanything will, for I have said all I can say about peace, and Caesar\r\nwas determined to repudiate it--still, if anything should happen, write\r\nand tell me what you think I should do in any case. For so far nothing\r\nhas happened that demands greater deliberation.\r\n\r\nI am glad you are pleased with the words of that loyal citizen\r\nTrebatius, and your frequent bravos have so far been my sole pleasure.\r\nYour letter I\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 276\r\n\r\nexspecto; quas quidem credo iam datas esse.

It is this distraction in which we now find\r\nourselves that is like death. For I have the alternative, either to\r\ntake part in politics with a free hand among the disloyal, or to side\r\nwith the loyal at all costs. I ought either to follow the loyalists in\r\ntheir rashness or attack the other party in its daring.

Your labour has not been in vain: you\r\nhave gratified me very much. And so I beseech you continue to write as\r\noften as you can, so long as it is possible, that is, so long as you\r\nknow where I am. And as for our daily lamentations let us make an end\r\nof them once for all, if we can, or at\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 282\r\n\r\nquod profecto potest. Non enim iam, quam dignitatem, quos honores,\r\nquem vitae statum amiserim, cogito, sed quid consecutus sim, quid\r\npraestiterim, qua in laude vixerim, his denique in malis quid intersit\r\ninter me et istos, quos propter omnia amisimus. Hi sunt, qui, nisi\r\nme civitate expulissent, obtinere se non putaverant posse licentiam\r\ncupiditatum suarum. Quorum societatis et sceleratae consensionis fides\r\nquo eruperit, vides.\r\n\r\nAlter ardet furore et scelere, nec remittit aliquid, sed in dies\r\ningravescit; modo Italia expulit, nunc alia ex parte persequi, ex\r\nalia provincia exspoliare conatur, nec iam recusat, sed quodam modo\r\npostulat, ut, quem ad modum est, sic etiam appelletur tyrannus. Alter,\r\nis qui nos sibi quondam ad pedes stratos ne sublevabat quidem, qui se\r\nnihil contra huius voluntatem facere posse, elapsus e soceri manibus\r\nac ferro bellum terra et mari comparat, non iniustum ille quidem, sed\r\ncum pium tum etiam necessarium, suis tamen civibus exitiabile, nisi\r\nvicerit, calamitosum, etiamsi vicerit. Horum ego summorum imperatoram\r\nnon modo res gestas non antepono meis, sed ne fortunam quidem ipsam;\r\nqua illi florentissima, nos duriore conflictati videmur. Quis enim\r\npotest aut deserta per se patria aut oppressa beatus esse? Et, si, ut\r\nnos a te admonemur, recte in illis libris diximus nihil esse bonum,\r\nnisi quod honestum, nihil malum, nisi\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 283\r\n\r\nany rate moderate them, which we certainly can. For I have given up\r\nthinking of the dignity, the honours and the position I have lost:\r\nI think of what I have attained, what I have done, the glory of my\r\ncareer, in short what a difference there is even in our present straits\r\nbetween me and those through whom I have lost all. They are the people\r\nwho thought they could not attain their extravagant desires without\r\nexpelling me from the State: and you see now what has come of their\r\ncoalition in a criminal conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe one burns with a madman's lust for crime, which does not cool one\r\nwhit, but rather increases day by day. He has just driven Pompey from\r\nItaly, now on one side of the world he is pursuing him, on the other he\r\nis trying to rob him of his province: and he no longer refuses, nay,\r\nhe practically demands, to be called a tyrant, as he is. The other,\r\nwho once would not even give me a helping hand, when I threw myself at\r\nhis feet, declaring he could do nothing against Caesar's will, now,\r\nhaving slipped from the grasp of his father-in-law's mailed hand, is\r\npreparing war by land and sea. The war is not unjust on his part, nay,\r\nit is even righteous and necessary; but, unless he conquers, it will\r\nbe fatal to his fellow-countrymen; and, even if he does conquer, it\r\nwill be disastrous. These are our great men; but I do not hold their\r\nachievements one whit superior to mine, nor even their fortune, though\r\nthey may seem to have basked in fortune's smiles while I have met her\r\nfrowns. For who can be happy, when he has caused his country to be\r\ndeserted or enslaved? And if, as you admonish me, I was right in saying\r\nin those books of mine that nothing is good, save\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 284\r\n\r\nquod turpe sit, certe uterque istorum est miserrimus, quorum utrique\r\nsemper patriae salus et dignitas posterior sua dominatione et\r\ndomesticis commodis fuit. Praeclara igitur conscientia sustentor, cum\r\ncogito me de re publica aut meruisse optime, cum potuerim, aut certe\r\nnumquam nisi pie cogitasse, eaque ipsa tempestate eversam esse rem\r\npublicam, quam ego XIIII annis ante prospexerim. Hac igitur conscientia\r\ncomite proficiscar magno equidem cum dolore nec tam id propter me\r\naut propter fratrem meum, quorum est iam acta aetas, quam propter\r\npueros, quibus interdum videmur praestare etiam rem publicam debuisse.\r\nQuorum quidem alter non tam quia filius quam,[125] quia maiore pietate\r\nest, me mirabiliter excruciat, alter (o rem miseram! nihil enim mihi\r\naccidit in omni vita acerbius) indulgentia videlicet nostra depravatus\r\neo progressus est, quo non audeo dicere. Et exspecto tuas litteras;\r\nscripsisti enim te scripturum esse plura, cum ipsum vidisses. Omne\r\nmeum obsequium in illum fuit cum multa severitate, neque unum eius\r\nnec parvum, sed multa magna delicta compressi. Patris autem lenitas\r\namanda potius ab illo quam tam crudeliter neglegenda. Nam litteras\r\neius ad Caesarem missas ita graviter tulimus, ut te quidem celaremus,\r\nsed ipsius videremur vitam insuavem reddidisse. Hoc vero eius iter\r\nsimulatioque pietatis qualis fuerit, non audeo dicere; tantum scio,\r\npost Hirtium conventum\r\n\r\n[125] quia filius quam _added by Malaspina_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 285\r\n\r\nwhat is honourable, and nothing bad, save what is dishonourable, then\r\ncertainly both of them are most miserable, since both of them have\r\nthought less of their country's safety and dignity than of their own\r\nhigh place and private interests. My conscience then is clear and helps\r\nto support me, when I think that I have always rendered my country\r\ngood service, when I could, and assuredly have never harboured any but\r\nloyal thoughts, and that the State has been wrecked by the very storm\r\nwhich I foresaw fourteen years ago. With a clear conscience then I\r\nshall depart, though the parting will cost me a bitter pang: nor shall\r\nI go so much for my own sake or for my brother's--our day is done--as\r\nfor our children, to whom I think at times we ought to have secured\r\nat least a free country. For one of them I feel the most poignant\r\ngrief--not so much because he is my son, as because he is exceedingly\r\ndutiful--while the other unfortunately has turned out the bitterest\r\ndisappointment of my life. He has been spoiled, I suppose, by our\r\nindulgence, and has gone to lengths that I dare not name. I am waiting\r\nfor your letter too; for you promised to write more fully when you\r\nhad seen him himself. All my humouring of him has been accompanied by\r\nconsiderable strictness: and I have had to put my foot down not over\r\none fault of his or a small one, but over many grave faults. But his\r\nfather's kindness should surely have been repaid by affection rather\r\nthan by such cruel disregard. For we were more annoyed at his sending\r\nletters to Caesar than we let you see, but I think we made his life a\r\nburden to him. I dare not describe this recent journey of his and his\r\nhypocritical pretence of filial duty: I only know that, after he met\r\nHirtius,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 286\r\n\r\narcessitum a Caesare, cum eo de meo animo a suis rationibus alienissimo\r\net consilio relinquendi Italiam; et haec ipsa timide. Sed nulla nostra\r\nculpa est, natura metuenda est. Haec Curionem, haec Hortensi filium,\r\nnon patrum culpa corrupit.\r\n\r\nIacet in maerore meus frater neque tam de sua vita quam de mea metuit.\r\nHuic tu huic tu malo adfer consolationes, si ullas potes; maxime quidem\r\nillam velim, ea, quae ad nos delata sint, aut falsa esse aut minora.\r\nQuae si vera sint, quid futurum sit in hac vita et fuga, nescio.\r\nNam, si haberemus rem publicam, consilium mihi non deesset nec ad\r\nseveritatem nec ad indulgentiam. Nunc haec sive iracundia sive dolore\r\nsive metu permotus gravius scripsi, quam aut tuus in illum amor aut\r\nmeus postulabat, si vera sunt, ignosces, si falsa, me libente eripies\r\nmihi hunc errorem. Quoquo modo vero se res habebit, nihil adsignabis\r\nnec patruo nec patri.\r\n\r\nCum haec scripsissem, a Curione mihi nuntiatum est eum ad me venire.\r\nVenerat enim is in Cumanum vesperi pridie, id est Idibus. Si quid\r\nigitur eius modi sermo eius attulerit, quod ad te scribendum sit, id\r\nhis litteris adiungam.\r\n\r\nPraeteriit villam meam Curio iussitque mihi nuntiari mox se venturum\r\ncucurritque Puteolos, ut ibi contionaretur. Contionatus est, rediit,\r\nfuit ad me sane diu. O rem foedam! Nosti hominem; nihil occultavit, in\r\nprimis nihil esse certius, quam ut\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 287\r\n\r\nhe was summoned to Caesar's presence, and discussed the difference\r\nbetween my views and his own and my plan of leaving Italy. Even\r\nthat I write with hesitation. But it is no fault of mine: it is his\r\ndisposition which must cause us anxiety. That is what corrupted Curio\r\nand Hortensius' son, not their fathers' fault.\r\n\r\nMy brother is prostrate with grief, though he does not fear for his own\r\nlife so much as for mine. It is to him, to him more than me, I want you\r\nto offer consolation, if you can. The best consolation would be that\r\nwhat we have heard was false or exaggerated. If it was true, I fail to\r\nsee what will come of this runaway existence. For if the constitution\r\nwere still intact, I should know what to do both in the way of severity\r\nand in the way of kindness. Now, under the sway of some passion, be it\r\nwrath or sorrow or fear, I have written more bitterly than either your\r\naffection for him or mine warrants. If what I have said is true, you\r\nwill pardon me: if it is false, I shall be only too glad to have the\r\nerror removed. However it may be, you must not blame his uncle or his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nWhen I had got so far, I received a message from Curio that he was\r\ncoming to see me. He came to his place here yesterday evening, that\r\nis on the 13th. If any point worth mentioning to you occurs in our\r\nconversation, I will add it to this letter.\r\n\r\nCurio passed by my house, and sent a message saying he was coming very\r\nsoon. Then he hurried off to make a speech at Puteoli. He made his\r\nspeech, returned and stayed a very long time. How disgusting! You know\r\nthe sort of man he is: he hid nothing.

He had no doubt about\r\nCaesar getting the two Spains and said he would start from them with\r\nan army to wherever Pompey might be. Pompey's death would be the end\r\nof the war. Caesar had been carried away by anger into wishing to have\r\nthe tribune Metellus killed and he had had a narrow shave. If it had\r\nhappened, there would have been an enormous massacre. Many had spoken\r\nin favour of a massacre: and Caesar himself was not by nature and\r\ninclination averse to cruelty, but he thought that mild measures would\r\nwin popularity. But, if he lost popular favour, he would be cruel. He\r\nhad been put out when he found that he had offended the populace itself\r\nby seizing the treasury: and so, though he had fully made up his mind\r\nto harangue the people before leaving, he had not ventured to do so,\r\nand he had gone off in a very disturbed state of mind. But when I asked\r\nCurio what he looked forward to, what end, and what constitution, he\r\nconfessed openly that there was no hope left. He was afraid of Pompey's\r\nfleet, and, if it put to sea, he should desert Sicily. I asked, what\r\nwas the meaning of his six lictors, why their staves were laurelled,\r\nif the Senate gave them to him, and why there were six, if Caesar gave\r\nthem. [128] He said, \"I wanted to snatch a vote from the House for them\r\n(for it could not be done openly): but Caesar hates the Senate like\r\npoison, and declares that all such authority will\r\n\r\n[128] Six lictors were the regular number for the propraetor of Sicily;\r\nbut their staves would not be laurelled as Curio had not won a victory\r\nover a public enemy. If appointed a _legatus_ to Caesar he might have\r\nhad proconsular powers and twelve lictors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 290\r\n\r\n\"Cur autem sex?\" \"Quia XII nolui; nam licebat.\" Tum ego \"Quam vellem,\"\r\ninquam, \"petisse ab eo, quod audio Philippum impetrasse! Sed veritus\r\nsum, quia ille a me nihil impetrabat.\" \"Libenter,\" inquit, \"tibi\r\nconcessisset. Verum puta te impetrasse; ego enim ad eum scribam, ut\r\ntu ipse voles, de ea re nos inter nos locutos. Quid autem illius\r\ninterest, quoniam in senatum non venis, ubi sis?

I will write to him just as you wish,\r\nand say we have spoken about the matter. What does it matter to him\r\nwhere you are, as you do not attend the House? If you were not in Italy\r\nat this very moment, it would not damage his cause in the least.\"\r\nI responded that I was looking for a retired and solitary retreat,\r\nespecially because I still had my lictors in attendance. He agreed\r\nwith me. \"How about this then,\" said I. \"My way through to Greece lies\r\nthrough your province, as the Adriatic is guarded.\" \"There is nothing I\r\nshould like better,\" he said, and added many very handsome remarks. So\r\nsomething has come of it: I could sail not only in safety, but openly.\r\n\r\nThe rest he put off for the next day: I will write and tell you if\r\nthere is anything worth mentioning. But there are some things I omitted\r\nto ask: whether Caesar was going to wait for an interregnum, or what\r\nhe meant by saying that he had been offered the consulship but had\r\nrefused it for the next year. And there are other points I must ask\r\nabout. Finally he swore--though to be sure he makes no bones about\r\nswearing--that Caesar was very friendly to me. I expressed my doubt. He\r\nsaid he had heard from Dolabella. I asked what he said, and he declared\r\nhe said Caesar had thanked him warmly for wanting me to go to Rome, and\r\nnot only approved but showed pleasure. Of course I felt relieved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 292\r\n\r\nest enim suspicio illa domestici mali et sermonis Hirtiani.

That is impossible. For\r\neither, as I should much prefer, Caesar must be driven from Spain, or\r\nthe war will drag on, or Caesar will seize Spain, as he seems to be\r\nconfident. If Caesar is driven from Spain, you can imagine how pleasing\r\nand honourable my arrival will seem to Pompey, when I suppose even\r\nCurio will go over to him. If the war drags on, for what am I to wait\r\nor how long? The remaining alternative is that I should keep neutral,\r\nif we are beaten in Spain. I take the opposite view: for I think I am\r\nmore bound to desert Caesar as victor than as vanquished, and while\r\nhe is still doubtful rather than confident about his fortunes: for I\r\nforesee a massacre, if he conquers, attack on the wealth of private\r\npersons, the recall of exiles, repudiation of debts, high office for\r\nthe vilest men, and a tyranny intolerable to a Persian much more to a\r\nRoman. Will my indignation be able to keep silence? Can my eyes endure\r\nto see myself giving my vote along with Gabinius, or indeed Gabinius\r\nbeing asked his opinion before me? Your client Clodius in waiting?\r\nPlaguleius, the client of C. Ateius, and all the others? But why do I\r\nmake a list of opponents, when I shall be unable to see in the House\r\nwithout pain friends whom I have defended or to mix with them without\r\nshame? And what if even that may not be allowed to me, for all I know?\r\nFor Caesar's friends write me that he is not at all\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 302\r\n\r\nfecisse, quod in senatum non venerim.

Am I still to hesitate\r\nwhether to sell myself to him at grave risk, when I refused to join\r\nhim even with a certainty of reward. Besides consider this that the\r\nverdict on the whole contest does not depend on Spain; unless perhaps\r\nyou think that, if Spain is lost, Pompey will throw down his arms, when\r\nhis policy has always been that of Themistocles. He considers that the\r\nmaster of the sea must be master of the empire: so he has never planned\r\nto hold Spain for its own sake. The equipment of the fleet has always\r\nbeen his first care. So he will take to the sea in due season with a\r\nhuge fleet and will come to Italy. What then will be the fate of us, if\r\nwe stay here idle? Neutrality will be impossible. Shall we then resist\r\nthe fleet? Could there be a crime deeper, greater or baser? Isolated I\r\nran risks: shall I hesitate with the help of Pompey and the rest of the\r\nnobles. If now I am to take no account of duty but only of danger, it\r\nis from Pompey's party I run risk, if I do wrong, from Caesar, if I do\r\nright: and such is our evil plight that no plan is so free from danger\r\nas to leave a doubt that I should avoid doing with disgrace as well\r\nas danger what I should have avoided, if it had been safe. You will\r\nsay I might safely have crossed the sea with Pompey. It was altogether\r\nimpossible. It is easy to reckon the days: but nevertheless (for let\r\nme confess the truth: I do not even sugar my confession) supposing I\r\ncould, I was mistaken over a point which perhaps ought not to have\r\nmisled me; but it did. I thought that peace might be made: and, if it\r\nshould be, I did not wish Caesar to be angry with me, when at the same\r\ntime he was\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 304\r\n\r\nesset Pompeio, nolui. Senseram enim, quam idem essent. Hoc verens in\r\nhanc tarditatem incidi. Sed assequor omnia, si propero, si cunctor,\r\namitto. Et tamen, mi Attice, auguria quoque me incitant quadam spe non\r\ndubia, nec haec collegii nostri ab Atto, sed illa Platonis de tyrannis.\r\nNullo enim modo posse video stare istum diutius, quin ipse per se etiam\r\nlanguentibus nobis concidat, quippe qui florentissimus ac novus VI, VII\r\ndiebus ipsi illi egenti ac perditae multitudini in odium acerbissimum\r\nvenerit, qui duarum rerum simulationem tam cito amiserit, mansuetudinis\r\nin Metello, divitiarum in aerario. Iam quibus utatur vel sociis vel\r\nministris? ii provincias, ii rem publicam regent, quorum nemo duo\r\nmenses potuit patrimonium suum gubernare?\r\n\r\nNon sunt omnia colligenda, quae tu acutissime perspicis, sed tamen ea\r\npone ante oculos; iam intelleges id regnum vix semenstre esse posse.\r\nQuod si me fefellerit, feram, sicut multi clarissimi homines in re\r\npublica excellentes tulerunt, nisi forti me Sardanapalli vicem [in\r\nsuo lectulo][138] mori malle censueris quam exsilio Themistocleo. Qui\r\ncom fuisset, ut ait Thucydides, τῶν μὲν παρόντων δι' ἐλαχίστης βουλῆς\r\nκράτιστος γνώμων, τῶν δὲ μελλόντων ἐς πλεῖστον τοῦ γενησομένου ἄριστος\r\nεἰκαστής, tamen incidit in eos\r\n\r\n[138] _The words in brackets are deleted by Nipperdey as a gloss._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 305\r\n\r\nfriendly with Pompey. For I had realized how exactly they were alike.\r\nThat fear of mine led me to delay. But I gain all now by haste, and, if\r\nI delay, I lose all. Nevertheless, my friend, there are auguries which\r\nurge me on, with hope not uncertain: I do not mean those of my own\r\ncollege which came down from Attus Navius: but Plato's words about the\r\ntyrant.[139] For I see that Caesar can in no way maintain his position\r\nmuch longer, without causing his own fall, even if we are backward.\r\nFor in his first and flourishing days it did not take him a week to\r\nincur the bitter hatred of the needy abandoned rabble, by letting slip\r\nthrough his fingers so quickly his fictitious claim to two things,\r\nclemency in the case of Metellus and ample wealth in the case of the\r\npublic money. Now what kind of associates and servants can he employ?\r\nAre men to rule provinces and direct affairs not one of whom could\r\nsteer his own fortunes for two months?\r\n\r\n[139] Probably _Republic_ VIII, 562.\r\n\r\nI need not put all the points together; you see them clearly enough:\r\nbut put them before your eyes and you will understand that his reign\r\ncan hardly last for half a year. If I am mistaken, I will bear the\r\nconsequences, as many illustrious men, eminent in public life, have\r\nborne them, unless perhaps you consider that I should prefer to die\r\nlike Sardanapalus [in his bed] rather than like Themistocles in exile.\r\nFor Thucydides tells us that though Themistocles was \"the best judge of\r\ncurrent affairs on the shortest reflection, and the shrewdest to guess\r\nat what would happen in the future,\" yet he fell into misfortunes,\r\nwhich he would have escaped, had there been no\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 306\r\n\r\ncasus, quos vitasset, si eum nihil fefellisset. Etsi is erat, ut ait\r\nidem, qui τὸ ἄμεινον καὶ τὸ χεῖρον ἐν τῷ ἀφανεῖ ἔτι ἑώρα μάλιστα,\r\ntamen non vidit, nec quo modo Lacedaemoniorum nec quo modo suorum\r\ncivium invidiam effugeret nec quid Artaxerxi polliceretur. Non fuisset\r\nilla nox tam acerba Africano, sapientissimo viro, non tam dirus ille\r\ndies Sullanus callidissimo viro, C. Mario, si nihil utrumque eorum\r\nfefellisset. Nos tamen hoc confirmamus illo augurio, quo diximus,\r\nnec nos fallit, nec aliter accidet. Corruat iste necesse est aut\r\nper adversarios aut ipse per se, qui quidem sibi est adversarius\r\nunus acerrimus. Id spero vivis nobis fore; quamquam tempus est nos\r\nde illa perpetua iam, non de hac exigua vita cogitare. Sin quid\r\naccident maturius, haud sane mea multum interfuerit, utrum factum\r\nvideam an futurum esse multo ante viderim. Quae cum ita sint, non\r\nest committendum, ut iis paream, quos contra me senatus, ne quid res\r\npublica detrimenti acciperet, armavit.\r\n\r\nTibi sunt omnia commendata, quae commendationis meae pro tuo in nos\r\namore non indigent. Nec hercule ego quidem reperio, quid scribam; sedeo\r\nenim πλουδοκῶν. Etsi nihil umquam tam fuit scribendum quam nihil mihi\r\numquam ex plurimis tuis iucunditatibus\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 307\r\n\r\nerror in his calculations. Though he was, as the same writer says, \"a\r\nclear-sighted judge of the better and the worse course in a doubtful\r\ncrisis,\"[140] yet he failed to see how to avoid the hate of the\r\nSpartans and his own fellow-citizens, nor what promise he ought to make\r\nto Artaxerxes. Africanus would have been spared that cruel night,[141]\r\nand that master of craft C. Marius the fateful day of Sulla's triumph,\r\nif nothing had ever escaped their calculations. So I strengthen myself\r\nby that prophetic remark of Plato: I am not deceived nor will it happen\r\notherwise. Caesar is bound to fall either through the agency of his\r\nenemies or of himself, and he is his own worst enemy. I hope it will\r\nbe in our lifetime, though it is an occasion for us to consider the\r\nlasting future and not our own narrow life. If anything happens to me\r\nbefore that day, it will not have mattered to me much whether I see it\r\ncome about or foresee that it will happen long before. Since this is\r\nso, I must not obey men against whom the Senate armed me with power to\r\nsee that the Republic took no harm.[142]\r\n\r\n[140] Thucydides i, 138.\r\n\r\n[141] P. Scipio Africanus the younger was found dead in his bed, and\r\nwas supposed to have been murdered at Carbo's instigation.\r\n\r\n[142] Cf. _Ad Fam._ XVI, 11, where he states that the Senate gave\r\na general commission to all magistrates and ex-consuls \"_ne quid\r\nrespublica detrimenti caperet_.\"\r\n\r\nTo you all my interests have been entrusted, though they need no\r\nentrusting considering your great affection for me.

So I think I must make for Malta, until there\r\nis news from Spain. This from Caesar's letter I almost think I may do\r\nwithout annoying him, for he says there is no more honourable or safe\r\ncourse open to me than to keep quite clear of the fight. You will say\r\n\"Where then is your courage which you showed in recent letters?\" It is\r\nthere and the same; but would that I had only to decide for myself. The\r\ntears of my family at times weaken me, when they beg me to wait for\r\nnews about Spain. The miserable tone of M. Caelius' letter making this\r\nsame request that I should wait, not to risk so rashly my fortunes, my\r\nonly son and all my family, moved our boys to weeping; although my own\r\nson is made of stronger stuff, and for that very reason he affects me\r\nmore deeply, thinking only of my reputation.\r\n\r\nSo I shall go to Malta, thence where it seems good. Still even now send\r\nme a line, especially if there is any news from Afranius. If I have an\r\ninterview with Antony, I will inform you of the result. However, as you\r\nadvise, I will take care how I trust him, for the policy of concealment\r\nis hard and dangerous too. Servius Sulpicius I await till the 7th. Both\r\nhis wife Postumia and his son urge me to this. I rejoice that your ague\r\nis better. I send you also a copy of Caelius' letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIXa\r\n\r\nCAELIUS TO CICERO, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Intimile, Apr. 16_, B.C. _49_]\r\n\r\nIn my dismay at your letter, in which you show that your thoughts are\r\nset on some unhappy act\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 316\r\n\r\nneque non tamen, quale esset, quod cogitates, aperuisti, has ad\r\nte ilico litteras scripsi. Per fortunas tuas, Cicero, per liberos\r\nte oro et obsecro, ne quid gravius de salute et incolumitate tua\r\nconsulas. Nam deos hominesque amicitiamque nostram testificor me tibi\r\npraedixisse neque temere monuisse, sed, postquam Caesarem convenerim\r\nsententiamque eius, qualis futura esset parta victoria, cognorim,\r\nte certiorem fecisse. Si existimas eandem rationem fore Caesaris in\r\ndimittendis adversariis et condicionibus ferendis, erras; nihil nisi\r\natrox et saevum cogitat atque etiam loquitur; iratus senatui exiit, his\r\nintercessionibus plane incitatus est; non mehercules erit deprecationi\r\nlocus. Quare, si tibi tu, si filius unicus, si domus, si spes tuae\r\nreliquae tibi carae sunt, si aliquid apud te nos, si vir optimus,\r\ngener tuus, valemus, quorum fortunam non debes velle conturbare, noli\r\ncommittere,[145] ut eam causam, in cuius victoria salus nostra est,\r\nodisse aut relinquere cogamur, aut impiam cupiditatem contra salutem\r\ntuam habeamus. Denique illud cogita, quod offensae fuerit in ista\r\ncunctatione, te subisse. Nunc te contra victorem Caesarem facere,\r\nquem dubiis rebus laedere noluisti, et ad eos fugatos accedere, quos\r\nresistentes sequi nolueris, summae stultitiae est. Vide, ne, dum\r\npudet te parum optimatem esse, parum diligenter, quid optimum sit,\r\neligas. Quod si totum tibi persuadere non possum, saltem, dum, quid de\r\nHispaniis agamus, scitur,\r\n\r\n[145] noli committere _added by Lehmann_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 317\r\n\r\nwithout saying exactly what it is, though you disclose sufficiently\r\nwhat kind of an act it is, I write this on the spot. In the name of\r\nyour fortunes and your children, I beg and beseech you, Cicero, not to\r\ntake any step that may endanger your life and safety. For I call gods\r\nand men and our friendship to witness that I told you before, and that\r\nit was no casual warning that I gave you, but certain information,\r\nafter I had met Caesar and found out what his view would be, if he won\r\nthe victory. If you imagine that he will maintain his present policy of\r\nletting his adversaries go and making peace, you are mistaken; he is\r\nmeditating and even proclaiming nothing but cruelty and severity. He\r\nleft Rome in anger with the Senate: these recent vetoes have clearly\r\nprovoked him: you may take my word for it there will be no chance\r\nof begging off. Then, if you have any care for yourself, your only\r\nson, your house and what hopes you have left, if I and your excellent\r\nson-in-law have any influence with you--and you ought not to wish to\r\nspoil our fortunes--then do not compel us to hate or relinquish a\r\ncause, in whose victory our safety lies, or to harbour unnatural wishes\r\nfor your destruction. Finally consider this: any offence there may\r\nhave been in your hesitation, you have already given. Now it is the\r\nheight of folly to side against Caesar in his hour of victory, when you\r\nrefused to attack him while his fortunes were doubtful; and to join in\r\nthe flight of those, whom you would not follow when they stood their\r\nground. Beware lest for fear of showing too little zeal for the \"better\r\nparty,\" you use too little care in choosing the better course. But, if\r\nI cannot persuade you entirely, at least wait till it is known how we\r\nget on in Spain,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 318\r\n\r\nexspecta; quas tibi nuntio adventu Caesaris fore nostras.

Negavi\r\nme scire, sed tamen ab eo petivi, ut ad te litteras mitteret, quibus\r\nmaxime ad remanendum commoveri posses. Me secum in Hispaniam ducit.\r\nNam, nisi ita faceret, ego, priusquam ad urbem accederem, ubicumque\r\nesses, ad te percucurrissem, et hoc a te praesens contendissem atque\r\nomni vi te retinuissem. Etiam atque etiam, Cicero, cogita, ne te\r\ntuosque omnis funditus evertas, ne te sciens prudensque eo demittas,\r\nunde exitum vides nullum esse. Quodsi te aut voces optimatium\r\ncommovent, aut non nullorum hominum insolentiam et iactationem\r\nferre non potes, eligas censeo aliquod oppidum vacuum a bello, dum\r\nhaec decernuntur; quae iam erunt confecta.

I said I knew nothing about it: but I asked him to send you\r\na letter as the best means of inducing you to stay. He is taking me\r\nwith him to Spain. If he were not, I should have hurried to you, before\r\ngoing to Rome, wherever you might have been, and should have pressed\r\nthis view on you personally and done all in my power to restrain you.\r\nOnce more and yet once more, Cicero, think before you utterly destroy\r\nyourself and all your family: do not wittingly and with your eyes open\r\nput yourself in a position from which you see there is no escape. But,\r\nif you are moved by the call of the conservative party, or if you\r\ncannot endure the insolence and arrogant behaviour of certain persons,\r\nI think you should choose some town remote from the war, until the\r\nmatter is settled: and settled it will be at once.

See\r\nin what an _ex cathedra_ tone he answers me:--\"Your policy is quite\r\nright. For a man who wishes to be neutral remains in his country; the\r\nman who leaves his country seems to express his conviction on one side\r\nor the other; but it is not for me to determine, whether anyone has\r\nthe right to leave or not.

He is to come on the evening of the 3rd, that is to-day. To-morrow\r\ntherefore he will perhaps come to me. I will sound him: I will hear\r\nhim: say I am in no hurry: that I will send to Caesar.

The conduct of my brother about which you write\r\nshows little firmness, but no chicanery, no treachery, nothing\r\ninflexibly opposed to goodness, nothing that cannot be turned where you\r\nwill by a single conversation. In short all his relations, even those\r\nwith whom he is so often angry, are nevertheless dear to him, and I\r\nto be sure am dearer than life. I do not blame him for writing in one\r\nstrain about his boy to you and in another to the boy's mother. I am\r\ndistressed by what you say about the journey and your sister, and the\r\nmore so because the times are such that I cannot remedy the matter. For\r\ncertainly I would have done so: but you see in what trouble I am, what\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 13,000 sesterces]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 20,000 sesterces]\r\n\r\nAs for his financial affairs, I often hear from him, and they are\r\nnot in such a state as to prevent him from being anxious to pay you\r\nand from making efforts to that end: but if Q. Axius does not pay me\r\nin this my flight the £100 I lent his son, and pleads in excuse the\r\nstate of the times, and if Lepta and others do the same, I confess I\r\nam always surprised to hear from Quintus that he is pressed for some\r\n£175. For of course you see his straits. However he has ordered the\r\nsum to be paid to your account. Perhaps you suppose that he is slow or\r\nclose-fisted in money matters. No one is less so: but enough about my\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nAs for his son, the father has certainly always indulged him; but\r\nindulgence does not make him a liar or a miser or disloyal to his\r\nfriends, though it does perhaps make him surly, haughty and aggressive.\r\nAccordingly he has these defects which are due to spoiling; but they\r\nare not intolerable, shall I say, as young men go nowadays.

My own policy has\r\nlacked vigour owing to my pity for him; and the more he wants me to be\r\nunflinching, the more I fear I may prove cruel to him.\r\n\r\nWell Antony came yesterday evening; soon perhaps he will visit me,\r\nperhaps not even that, as he has written what he wanted done; but you\r\nshall know forthwith what has happened. All I do now is done secretly.\r\n\r\nWhat shall I do about the boys? Shall I entrust them to a small boat?\r\nWhat courage do you suppose I shall have on the voyage? For I remember\r\nsailing in the summer in an open Rhodian boat with them and how anxious\r\nI was; and how do you suppose it will be in the bad season in a tiny\r\npinnace? Misery everywhere!\r\n\r\nTrebatius is with me, a real man and a loyal citizen. Ye gods, what\r\nawful news he brings! So even Balbus is thinking of attending the\r\nSenate! But I will give Trebatius himself a letter for you to-morrow. I\r\nagree with your letter that Vettienus is friendly to me.

Never have I seen a\r\nman more upset with fear; and upon my soul he feared nothing that did\r\nnot deserve to be feared. He pointed out that Pompey was angry with\r\nhim, that Caesar was not friendly, that the victory of either would\r\nbe terrible, both because Pompey was cruel and Caesar daring, and\r\nbecause of their money difficulties, which could only be got rid of by\r\nan attack on private property. He bewailed all this with such a flood\r\nof tears, that I was surprised they had not dried up in all that long\r\ntime of misery.

Search rather\r\nfor any news about Spain or Massilia. What Servius says about them is\r\nquite satisfactory, and he also tells me there is excellent authority\r\nfor the story of the two legions. News of this kind then send me, if\r\nyou get it, and such like topics. Anyhow in a few days something must\r\nbe heard.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Servius.

Servius' advice has not been\r\nhelpful. All sorts of bars meet us in every opinion he expresses. Only\r\none man, C. Marcellus, have I known to be more timid, and he is sorry\r\nhe was ever a consul. What a lowborn spirit! He is said even to have\r\nstrengthened Antony's resolution to prevent my departure: so that his\r\nown conduct I suppose may appear more honourable. Antony started for\r\nCapua on the 10th, sending word that shame prevented his visiting me,\r\nbecause he thought I was annoyed with him. So I shall go, and openly as\r\nyou advise, unless hope of playing a more important part shall offer.\r\nBut that can scarcely occur so soon. Allienus the praetor thought one\r\nof his colleagues would be chosen,[158] if I were not. Let it be anyone\r\nthey like so long as it is some one.\r\n\r\n[158] As peace delegate.\r\n\r\nAs to your sister, I approve. As for young Quintus, I am doing my best,\r\nand I hope things are better. As for my brother Quintus, you must know\r\nthat he is taking extraordinary pains to borrow money to settle his\r\ndebt; but so far has squeezed nothing out of L. Egnatius. Axius is\r\nmodest about the £100[159]: for he often requested in his letters that\r\nI should pay Gallius as much as he wanted. Even if he had not written,\r\ncould I have helped it? I have often promised indeed; but he wanted so\r\nmuch at once. They should have helped me rather in my difficulties,\r\nconfound them. But I will write of this another time. I am glad you\r\nare rid of your ague, and Pilia too. While bread and provisions are\r\nbeing put on board, I am going off to my estate at Pompeii. Please\r\nthank Vettienus for his trouble.

I should not only\r\nhave been civil to him, I should have pardoned him altogether, if he\r\nhad come in the spirit you described. For the letter I got at Arpinum\r\nsaid that he was coming and would do whatever I wanted; and I wanted or\r\nrather longed that he should be with me. It was because he had flatly\r\nrefused to do so, when he came to my villa at Formiae, I used to write\r\nto you about him rather bitterly. However, after the first greeting,\r\nhe said, to put it shortly, that I must excuse him and that business\r\nprevented his going with me. I said little in reply, but I was greatly\r\nhurt, for I understood that he looked down on my fortunes. You may be\r\nastonished, but you must know that this is one of the greatest sorrows\r\nI have suffered in this crisis. I hope that he may be a friend to you.\r\nWhen I wish that, I wish you prosperity, for just so long he will be\r\nyour friend.\r\n\r\nMy plan, I hope, will be free from risk, for I have kept the matter a\r\nsecret, and, as I think, I shall not be watched very keenly.

Cum ad villam venissem,\r\nrelatum[160] est ad me centuriones trium cohortium, quae Pompeiis sunt,\r\nme velle postridie convenire. Haec mecum Ninnius noster, velle eos mihi\r\nse et oppidum tradere. At ego abii postridie a villa ante lucem, ut me\r\nomnino illi ne viderent. Quid enim erat in tribus cohortibus? quid,\r\nsi plures? quo apparatu? Cogitavi eadem illa Caeliana, quae legi in\r\nepistula tua, quam accepi, simul et in Cumanum veni eodem die, et simul\r\nfieri poterat, ut temptaremur. Omnem igitur suspicionem sustuli. Sed,\r\ndum redeo, Hortensius venerat et ad Terentiam salutatum deverterat.\r\nSermone erat usus honorifico erga me. Iam eum, ut puto, videbo; misit\r\nenim puerum se ad me venire.

When I arrived, I was told the\r\ncenturions of the three cohorts here wished to visit me the next day.\r\nThat was what my friend Ninnius said--that they wished to hand over\r\nthemselves and the town to me. But I left the next morning before\r\ndaybreak, so that they should not see me at all: for what was the\r\nuse of three cohorts, or more indeed? And what was our equipment?\r\nI pondered too over the matter of Caelius when I read it in your\r\nletter, which I received on the same day as I arrived at Cumae. It was\r\npossible too that it was a mere ruse, so I did away with all grounds\r\nof suspicion. But, while I was on my way back, Hortensius came, and\r\nturned out of his way to greet Terentia, and he had spoken of me with\r\nmuch courtesy. I think I shall see him soon, for he has sent a servant\r\nto announce his coming. This is better behaviour than that of my fellow\r\naugur Antony, who carries an actress in a sedan among his lictors.\r\n\r\nAs you have lost your quartan fever and have not only thrown off your\r\nnew malady but also your cold, you must present yourself before me\r\nsound and fit in Greece.

I wish his conduct were always as it is now.[163] You would\r\nnever believe how gushing he was, and I intend to take advantage of it.\r\nThen Serapion came with a letter from you. Before I opened it, I told\r\nhim that you had written to me about him before, as you had done. Then\r\nwhen I had read the letter, I told him the rest in full detail, and\r\nupon my word I like the man; for I think him to be learned and upright.\r\nMoreover I think I will use his ship and make him my fellow-passenger.\r\n\r\n[163] Or \"I wish he would always confine himself to writing.\" But the\r\npassage may be corrupt.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the eyes often breaks out again, not indeed very\r\ntroublesome, but enough to prevent my writing.

Just now the equinox is delaying me. It has been very\r\nboisterous. When that is over, I only hope Hortensius may keep to the\r\nsame mind. So far he could not be more generous.\r\n\r\nYou wonder about the passport I mentioned, as if I hinted you were\r\nguilty of some crime. You say you can't discover how it came into my\r\nmind. For my part since you wrote that you meditated leaving, and I had\r\nheard that a passport was indispensable, I decided you must have one:\r\nand also because you had taken out a passport for the boys.

So far I have been detained by\r\nan astonishing calm, which has been a greater hindrance than the watch\r\nkept on me. For all that gush of Hortensius proved child's talk. So it\r\nwill be found.

For every eavesdropper[164] seems to be listening to\r\nwhat I say.\r\n\r\n[164] The people of Corycus in Pamphylia spied on merchant vessels and\r\nbetrayed them to pirates.

As for what you write about the dowry[167] I adjure you for\r\nheaven's sake to manage the whole business and protect the poor girl,\r\na victim of my culpable carelessness, with my funds, if there are any,\r\nand out of your own, so far as you can without inconvenience. Pray do\r\nnot let her remain in the utter want you depict. On what are the rents\r\nof my farms being wasted? That 500 guineas[168] of which you write, no\r\none ever told me that it had been kept back out of the dowry, for I\r\nwould never have allowed it. But that is the least of the blows I have\r\nsuffered. I cannot write to you about them for sorrow and tears. Of the\r\nmoney I had in Asia I have called in nearly half.

For despair of his success had so completely\r\ntaken possession of the minds of all the kings and peoples, that I\r\nthought this would happen to him, wherever he might go. I cannot help\r\nfeeling sorry for his fate, for I knew him to be a man of honour and\r\nhigh moral principle. Am I to condole with you about Fannius? He used\r\nto speak virulently of you for staying in Rome. L. Lentulus, you know,\r\nhad promised himself Hortensius' house, Caesar's gardens, and a place\r\nat Baiae. Precisely the same is taking place on this side too, except\r\nthat on the other there was no limit. For they counted every one who\r\nstayed in Italy as an enemy. But I would rather speak of this sometime\r\nwhen I am less worried.\r\n\r\nI hear my brother Quintus has set out for Asia to make his peace. About\r\nhis son I have heard nothing; but ask Diochares, Caesar's freedman, who\r\nbrought those letters from Alexandria. I have not seen him. He is said\r\nto have seen Quintus either on the way, or was it already in Asia? I am\r\nlooking forward to a letter from you, as the occasion demands. Please\r\ntry to get it conveyed to me as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nNovember 27.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nCICERO TO ATTICUS, GREETING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Brundisium, Dec. 17_, B.C. _48_]\r\n\r\nI am much obliged to you for your letter, in which you have recorded\r\ncarefully everything you think concerns me. So you say that they\r\napprove both of my actions, and of my keeping my lictors, as Sestius\r\nis allowed to keep his: though in his case I think it is not so much a\r\nquestion of being allowed to keep\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 370\r\n\r\nsit; cui non puto suos esse concessos, sed ad ipso datos. Audio enim\r\neum ea senatus consulta improbare, quae post discessum tribunorum\r\nfacta sunt. Quare poterit, si volet sibi constare, nostros lictores\r\ncomprobare,\r\n\r\nQuamquam quid ego de lictoribus, qui paene ex Italia decedere sim\r\niussus? Nam ad me misit Antonius exemplum Caesaris ad se litterarum,\r\nin quibus erat se audisse Catonem et L. Metellum in Italiam venisse,\r\nRomae ut essent palam. Id sibi non placere, ne qui motus ex eo fierent;\r\nprohiberique omnes Italia, nisi quorum ipse causam cognovisset;\r\ndeque eo vehementius erat scriptum. Itaque Antonius petebat a me per\r\nlitteras, ut sibi ignoscerem; facere se non posse, quin iis litteris\r\npareret. Tum ad eum misi L. Lamiam, qui demonstraret illum Dolabellae\r\ndixisse, ut ad me scriberet, ut in Italiam quam primum venirem; eius\r\nme litteris venisse. Tum ille edixit ita, ut me exciperet et Laelium\r\nnominatim. Quod sane nollem; poterat enim sine nomine res ipsa excipi.\r\n\r\nO multas et graves offensiones! quas quidem tu das operam ut lenias,\r\nnec tamen nihil proficis, quin hoc ipso minuis dolorem meum, quod,\r\nut minuas, tam valde laboras; idque velim ne gravere quam saepissime\r\nfacere. Maxime autem adsequere, quod vis, si me adduxeris, ut existimem\r\nme bonorum iudicium non funditus perdidisse. Quamquam quid tu in eo\r\npotes? Nihil scilicet. Sed, si quid res dabit tibi facultatis, id me\r\nmaxima consolari poterit; quod nunc quidem\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 371\r\n\r\nthem as of their being assigned to him by Caesar himself. For I am told\r\nhe repudiates all the decrees of the Senate which were passed after the\r\ndeparture of the tribunes. So, if he wants to be consistent, he will be\r\nable to approve my lictors.\r\n\r\nHowever, what is the use of talking about lictors, when I have almost\r\nbeen ordered to leave Italy. For Antony has sent me a copy of a letter\r\nfrom Caesar, in which he said he had heard that Cato and L. Metellus\r\nhad come to Italy and intended to live openly at Rome: that he did not\r\nlike, for fear it might cause some disturbance: and that none may enter\r\nItaly, until he has himself investigated their case. He put the point\r\nvery strongly. So Antony wrote asking my pardon, and saying he could\r\nnot help obeying the letter. Then I sent L. Lamia to him to point out\r\nthat Caesar had told Dolabella to write and tell me to come to Italy as\r\nsoon as possible: and that it was on the strength of that letter that\r\nI had come. Then Antony issued an edict excepting myself and Laelius\r\nby name. I wish he had not done that: he might have made an exception\r\nwithout mentioning names.\r\n\r\nWhat a heap of troubles and how serious too! And you are doing your\r\nbest to make them lighter, and with some success--indeed that you try\r\nso hard to relieve me is some relief in itself. I hope you won't find\r\nit a burden to do so as often as possible. But you will succeed in your\r\nobject best, if you can convince me that I have not entirely lost the\r\ngood opinion of the loyal party. Yet what can you do in that matter?\r\nNothing of course. But, if anything gives a chance, that is what will\r\nbest console me. I see that at present it is impossible:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 372\r\n\r\nvideo non esse, sed, si quid ex eventis, ut hoc nunc accidit. Dicebar\r\ndebuisse cum Pompeio proficisci. Exitus illius minuit eius officii\r\npraetermissi reprehensionem. Sed ex omnibus nihil magis tamem\r\ndesideratur, quam quod in Africam non ierim. Iudicio hoc sum usus, non\r\nesse barbaris auxiliis fallacissimae gentis rem publicam defendendam,\r\npraesertim contra exercitum saepe victorem, Non probant fortasse;\r\nmultos enim viros bonos in Africam venisse audio et scio fuisse antea.\r\nValde hoc loco urgeor. Hic quoque opus est casu, ut aliqui sint ex\r\neis, aut, si potest, omnes qui salutem anteponant. Nam, si perseverant\r\net obtinent, quid nobis futurum sit, vides. Dices: \"Quid illis, si\r\nvicti erunt?\" Honestior est plaga. Haec me excruciant. Sulpici autem\r\nconsilium non scripsisti cur meo non anteponeres. Quod etsi non tam\r\ngloriosum est quam Catonis, tamen et periculo vacuum est et dolore.\r\nExtremum est eorum, qui in Achaia sunt. Ei tamen ipsi se hoc melius\r\nhabent quam nos, quod et multi sunt uno in loco, et, cum in Italiam\r\nvenerint, domum statim venerint. Haec tu perge, ut facis, mitigare et\r\nprobare quam plurimis.\r\n\r\nQuod te excusas, ego vero et tuas causas nosco et mea interesse puto te\r\nistic esse, vel ut cum eis, quibus oportebit, agas, quae erunt agenda\r\nde nobis,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 373\r\n\r\nbut if anything does turns up, as in this present case. It used to be\r\nsaid that I ought to have gone with Pompey: but now his death tends to\r\nabsolve me from blame for neglecting my duty in that case. But where I\r\nam thought to have been most lacking is in not going to Africa. My view\r\nwas that barbarian auxiliaries drawn from a most deceitful race were\r\nnot the proper persons to defend the State, especially against an army\r\nwhich had won so many victories. That view may not meet with approval;\r\nfor I hear that many patriots have arrived in Africa, and I know there\r\nwere some there before. This is a point that really bothers me: and\r\nhere again I must trust to luck, that there may be some of them, or,\r\nif such a thing is possible, all of them, who put safety first. For,\r\nif they hold fast and succeed, you can see what a position I shall be\r\nin. You will say \"How about it, if they are defeated?\" That is a more\r\nhonourable blow. This is what tortures me. However, you have not told\r\nme why you do not prefer Sulpicius' policy to mine. It may not be so\r\nglorious as Cato's: but it is at any rate free from danger and regret.\r\nThe last case is that of those who stayed in Achaia. Even they are in\r\na better position than I am, because there are many of them together,\r\nand, when they do come to Italy, they will go straight home. Please\r\ncontinue your efforts to ameliorate my position and to win over as many\r\npeople as possible to approval.\r\n\r\nYou explain why you do not come. Yes, I know your reasons and think it\r\nis to my interest that you should stay where you are, for one thing\r\nthat you may be able to carry out any necessary negotiations about me\r\nwith the proper persons, as you have done.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 374\r\n\r\nut ea, quae egisti.

I think there are many who have reported or will report to\r\nCaesar either that I am repenting of my policy or that I do not approve\r\nof recent events. Though both are true, they say it out of spite\r\nagainst me, not because they have seen it to be so. Everything rests\r\non the support of Balbus and Oppius, and on their confirming Caesar's\r\ngood will to me by sending him frequent letters. Please do your best\r\nto bring this about. The other reason why I prefer you not to leave is\r\nthat you say Tullia begs for your assistance. What a misfortune? What\r\ncan I say? What can I even wish? I will cut the matter short, for tears\r\nspring to my eyes at once. I give you a free hand: do you look to it.\r\nOnly take care that nothing is done under the present circumstances to\r\noffend the great man. I crave your pardon. Tears and sorrow prevent me\r\nfrom dwelling any longer on this topic. I will only add that nothing\r\nmakes me feel more grateful to you than your love for her.\r\n\r\nYou are quite right to send letters for me to anyone to whom you think\r\nit necessary. I have met a man who saw young Quintus at Samos and his\r\nfather at Sicyon. They will easily obtain their pardon. I only hope,\r\nthat, as they will see Caesar first, they will think fit to further my\r\ncase with him, as much as I should have furthered theirs, if I had been\r\nable.\r\n\r\nYou ask me to take it in good part, if there is anything in your\r\nletters that wounds my feelings. I promise you to take it in the best\r\npossible part, and I beg you to write everything quite openly, as you\r\ndo, and to do so as often as possible.

I am paying very heavily\r\nfor my rashness, which you want to persuade me was prudence: and I\r\ndon't want to stop you arguing that it was and writing to me to that\r\neffect as often as possible. For your letters afford me a good deal\r\nof relief under the present circumstances. You must use your utmost\r\nendeavour with those who are my supporters and have influence with\r\nhim--Balbus and Oppius especially--to make them write about me as\r\nstrongly as possible. For I hear that I am being attacked by some who\r\nare with him, and also by letter. Their attack must be met, as the\r\nimportance of the matter demands. Fufius, a very bitter enemy of mine,\r\nis there. Quintus sent his son not only to make peace for himself, but\r\nto accuse me. He keeps saying that I am trying to set Caesar against\r\nhim, though Caesar and all his friends deny it. And he does not cease,\r\nwherever he is, from heaping all sorts of abuse on me. It is the most\r\nsurprising thing that ever happened to me and the bitterest of all\r\nmy present sorrows. Those who reported the matter to me professed to\r\nhave heard it from his own lips, when he was slandering me at Sicyon\r\nin the hearing of many. You know his way; indeed you may have had some\r\npersonal experience of it. Now it is all turned on me. But I increase\r\nmy own sorrow, and yours too, by speaking of it. So I return to my\r\nfirst point. Take care that Balbus sends some one expressly\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 378\r\n\r\naliquem Balbus.

If that had not been inserted by your own kind\r\nefforts, I might have gone to some lonely retreat. Now not even that is\r\nopen to me. How does it help me that I came before the tribunes entered\r\non office, when my coming at all does not help? And what have I now\r\nto hope from a man who never was friendly with me, when my ruin and\r\nhumiliation is secured even by law? Balbus' letters to me are becoming\r\ndaily cooler, and it may be he receives dozens against me. My own fault\r\nis my ruin. Fortune has brought no ills upon me: I have brought them\r\nall on my own head. For when I saw what kind of war it was going to be,\r\none side unprepared and weak and the other thoroughly well prepared, I\r\nhad made my plan--not a very courageous plan perhaps, but one for which\r\nthere were special excuses in my case. I gave way to my relations, or\r\nrather I obeyed them. What the real feelings of one of them were--the\r\none for whom you speak--you will know from the letters he has sent to\r\nyou and to others. I should never have opened them, had it not been\r\nfor the following circumstance. A packet was brought to me. I undid\r\nit to see if there was any letter for me. There was none; but one for\r\nVatinius and another for Ligurius. Those I had\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 380\r\n\r\nstatim ardentes dolore venerunt scelus hominis clamantes; epistulas\r\nmihi legerunt plenas omnium in me probrorum. Hic Ligurius furere. \"Se\r\nenim scire summo illum in odio fuisse Caesari. Illum tamen non modo\r\nfavisse, sed etiam tantam illi pecuniam dedisse honoris mei causa.\" Hoc\r\nego dolore accepto volui scire, quid scripsisset ad ceteros; ipsi enim\r\nilli putavi perniciosum fore, si eius hoc tantum scelus percrebruisset.\r\nCognovi eiusdem generis. Ad te misi. Quas si putabis illi ipsi utile\r\nesse reddi, reddes. Nil me laedet. Nam, quod resignatae sunt, habet,\r\nopinor, eius signum Pomponia. Hac ille acerbitate initio navigationis\r\ncum usus esset, tanto me dolore adfecit, ut postea iacuerim, neque nunc\r\ntam pro se quam contra me laborare dicitur.\r\n\r\nIta omnibus rebus urgeor; quas sustinere vix possum vel plane nullo\r\nmodo possum. Quibus in miseriis una est pro omnibus, quod istam miseram\r\npatrimonio, fortuna omni spoliatam relinquam. Quare te, ut polliceris,\r\nvidere plane velim. Alium enim, cui illam commendem, habeo neminem,\r\nquoniam matri quoque eadem intellexi esse parata quae mihi.

They came to me at once boiling with indignation and\r\ncrying shame on him, and they read me letters full of all kinds of\r\nabuse of myself. Then Ligurius burst out with fury, \"to his certain\r\nknowledge Caesar detested Quintus and had favoured him and given him\r\nall that money out of compliment to me.\" After this blow I wanted\r\nto know what he had said to the others: for I thought it would be\r\ndisastrous to his own reputation if such a scandal got abroad. I found\r\nthey were all of a piece, and have sent them to you. If you think it\r\nwill do him any good to have them delivered, have them delivered. It\r\nwon't do me any harm. Though the seals are broken, I think Pomponia\r\nhas his signet. When, at the beginning of our voyage, he adopted this\r\nbitter tone, I was so upset that I was prostrated afterwards; and now\r\nhe is said to be working against me rather than for himself.\r\n\r\nSo I am weighed down by such a heavy burden of griefs that I can hardly\r\nbear up under it; indeed, I cannot possibly bear up under it. And among\r\nall my miseries there is one that outweighs all the rest--that I shall\r\nleave that poor girl[175] deprived of her patrimony and penniless.\r\nSo I hope you will fulfil your promise and look after her.

Now on the morning of the same day I had sent messengers and\r\nhad given them a letter for you. But, when I read yours, I thought\r\nI ought to send some answer, particularly because you show you are\r\nin doubt as to what explanation I am going to offer Caesar of my\r\ndeparture when I did depart from Italy. I have no necessity for a new\r\nexplanation, for I have often told him myself and instructed others\r\nto tell him that I could not put up with people's talk, although I\r\nwished it, and much else to the same effect. For there is nothing that\r\nI should be more unwilling for him to imagine than that I did not make\r\nup my own mind on so important a question. Afterwards I received a\r\nletter from Cornelius Balbus the younger saying that Caesar thought my\r\nbrother Quintus had sounded the bugle for my departure (that was his\r\nexpression). I was not then aware of what Quintus had written about\r\nme to many people; but, though he had spoken and acted with great\r\nbitterness when face to face with me, none the less I wrote to Caesar\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am as much troubled about my brother Quintus as about myself; but\r\nunder the present circumstances I do not venture to recommend him to\r\nyou. One thing, however, I will venture to ask you--I\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 388\r\n\r\nabs te, quod te oro, ne quid existimes ab illo factum esse, quo minus\r\nmea in te officia constarent, minusve te diligerem, potiusque semper\r\nillum auctorem nostrae coniunctionis fuisse, meique itineris comitem,\r\nnon ducem. Quare ceteris in rebus tantum ei tribues, quantum humanitas\r\ntua amicitiaque vestra postulat.

Sed, ut video, multo magis est nobis laborandum de\r\nAfrica; quam quidem tu scribis confirmari cotidie magis ad condicionis\r\nspem quam victoriae. Quod utinam ita esset!

And therefore in all other matters you will give\r\nhim all the credit that your own kindness and your mutual friendship\r\ndemands. What I earnestly beg you again and again is, that you will not\r\nlet me stand in his light with you.\"\r\n\r\nSo, if I ever do meet Caesar, though I have no doubt that he will be\r\nlenient to Quintus and that he has already made that plain, I shall\r\nbehave as I always have behaved. But, as I see, what I ought to be\r\nmost anxious about is Africa, which you say is daily growing stronger,\r\nthough only to the extent of raising hopes of a compromise rather\r\nthan a victory. If it could only be true! But I read the signs quite\r\ndifferently, and I think you agree with me, and only say the contrary\r\nto hearten me, not to deceive me, especially as Spain too has now\r\njoined Africa.[177]\r\n\r\n[177] After his victory in Spain in 49 B.C., Caesar left Q.

For all those\r\nin Achaia and in Asia, who petitioned for pardon and did not obtain\r\nit, and even some of those who did, are said to be on the point of\r\nsailing for Africa. So I have no one to share my fault except Laelius,\r\nand even he is in a better position than I am in one respect, as he\r\nhas been taken back now.[180] But about me I have no doubt that Caesar\r\nhas written to Balbus and Oppius: if the news had been good, I should\r\nhave heard from them and they would have spoken to you too. I should\r\nlike you to speak to them about it and to let me know what they say,\r\nnot that any safeguard given by him can have any certainty, but still\r\nsomething can be foreseen and provided for. Though I am ashamed to look\r\nanyone in the face, especially with such a son-in-law, still in this\r\ndisastrous crisis I see nothing else to wish for. Quintus is still\r\nkeeping on, as both Pansa and Hirtius have written to tell me; and he\r\nis said too to be making for Africa with the rest. I will write to\r\nMinucius at Tarentum, and send your letter: I will let you know whether\r\nanything comes of it.

Omnia tamen sunt faciliora quam peccati\r\ndolor, qui et maximus est et aeternus. Cuius peccati si socios essem\r\nhabiturus ego, quos putavi, tamen esset ea consolatio tenuis. Sed\r\nhabet aliorum omnium ratio exitum, mea nullum. Alii capti, alii\r\ninterclusi non veniunt in dubium de voluntate, eo minus scilicet, cum\r\nse expedierint et una esse coeperint. Ei autem ipsi, qui sua voluntate\r\nad Fufium venerunt, nihil possunt nisi timidi existimari.

Solius\r\nenim meum peccatum corrigi non potest et fortasse Laeli. Sed quid me\r\nid levat? Nam C. quidem Cassium aiunt consilium Alexandream eundi\r\nmutavisse.\r\n\r\nHaec ad te scribo, non ut queas tu demere[185] sollicitudinem, sed ut\r\ncognoscam, ecquid tu ad ea adferas, quae me conficiunt; ad quae gener\r\naccedit et cetera, quae fletu reprimor ne scribam.

But all of them are lighter to bear than\r\nmy sense of guilt: that is overwhelming and enduring. If I were to have\r\nthose, whom I thought I had, to share that guilt, that would still be\r\nsome consolation, though a poor one. But every one else's case admits\r\nof some way out, mine of none. Some were captured, some cut off, so\r\nthere is no doubt about their intentions, especially since they have\r\nextricated themselves and joined forces again. Nay even those, who of\r\ntheir own free will came to Fufius,[186] can only be thought cowards.\r\nBut there are many who will be taken back, however they choose to take\r\nthemselves back to the fold. So you ought not to be surprised that I\r\ncannot bear up against all my sorrow. For I am the one and only person\r\nwhose slip cannot be mended, except perhaps Laelius--and what good is\r\nthat?--for they say even C. Cassius has changed his mind about going to\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\n[186] Q. Fufius Calenus was appointed governor of Greece after\r\nPharsalia by Caesar, and many Pompeians surrendered to him.\r\n\r\nThis I am writing to you not in the hope that you may remove my\r\ncare, but to know whether you have any suggestion to make about the\r\nthings that are wearing me out: to the rest you may add my son-in-law\r\nand other things which tears prevent me from writing. Why, even\r\nAesopus'[187] son grieves me sorely. There is absolutely nothing\r\nwanting to make me the most miserable of men. But I return to the first\r\npoint.

About going to meet him\r\nI will do as you advise. For no one thinks he is coming, and those who\r\ncome from Asia say there has been no word of peace: and it was hope of\r\na peace that led me into this error.\r\n\r\n[189] A letter purporting to come from Caesar, but later found to be a\r\nforgery.\r\n\r\nI see nothing to make me think of hope, especially now that that blow\r\nhas fallen in Asia, in Illyricum, in the Cassian affair, in Alexandria\r\nitself, in Rome and in Italy.[190] For my part, even if he is on his\r\nreturn--whereas\r\n\r\n[190] Cicero alludes to the defeat of Domitius Calvinus in Asia, the\r\nfailure of Aulus Gabinius in Illyricum, the insurrection of Baetica,\r\nwhich forced Cassius to leave the province, Caesar's difficulties at\r\nAlexandria, the riots in Rome, and the mutinous state of the army in\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 402\r\n\r\nbellum gerere dicitur, tamen ante reditum eius negotium confectum iri\r\nputo.\r\n\r\nQuod autem scribis quandam laetitiam bonorum esse commotam, ut sit\r\nauditum de litteris, tu quidem nihil praetermittis in quo putes\r\naliquid solacii esse, sed ego non adducor quemquam bonum ullam salutem\r\nputare mihi tanti fuisse, ut eam peterem ab illo, et eo minus, quod\r\nhuius consilii iam ne socium quidem habeo quemquam. Qui in Asia sunt,\r\nrerum exitum exspectant, Achaici etiam Fufio spem deprecationis\r\nafferunt. Horum et timor idem fuit primo qui meus et constitutum; mora\r\nAlexandrina causam illorum correxit, meam evertit. Quam ob rem idem a\r\nte nunc peto quod superioribus litteris, ut, si quid in perditis rebus\r\ndispiceres, quod mihi putares faciendum, me moneres. Si recipior ab\r\nhis, quod vides non fieri, tamen, quoad bellum erit, quid agam aut ubi\r\nsim, non reperio; sin iactor, eo minus. Itaque tuas litteras exspecto,\r\neasque ut ad me sine dubitatione scribas, rogo.\r\n\r\nQuod suades, ut ad Quintum scribam de his litteris, facerem, si me\r\nquicquam istae litterae delectarent. Etsi quidam scripsit ad me his\r\nverbis: \"Ego ut in his malis Patris sum non invitus; essem libentius,\r\nsi frater tuus ea de te loqueretur, quae ego audire vellem.\" Quod ais\r\nillum ad te scribere me\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 403\r\n\r\nhe is said to be still fighting--still I think the business will be\r\nsettled before he does return.\r\n\r\nYou say, however, that some feeling of pleasure was aroused among the\r\nloyalists when they heard of this letter. Of course you do not omit\r\nanything in which you think there is the least consolation, but I\r\ncannot bring myself to believe that any of the loyalists supposed that\r\nI prize any salvation highly enough to beg for it of him: especially as\r\nI have not even a single partner in this policy now. Those who are in\r\nAsia are waiting to see how things turn out: those in Achaia too keep\r\nholding out to Fufius the hope that they will petition for pardon. They\r\nat first had the same fear and the same plan as myself; but the hitch\r\nat Alexandria improved their case and ruined mine. So I still make the\r\nsame request of you as in former letters: if in these desperate straits\r\nyou see anything you think I ought to do, tell me of it. If I am taken\r\nback by the loyalists, which you see is not the case, still, so long as\r\nthe war lasts, I don't see what I am to do or where I am to stay; still\r\nless, if I am rejected by them. So I await a letter from you, and I beg\r\nyou to write to me without hesitation.\r\n\r\nYou advise me to write to Quintus about this letter. I would, if the\r\nletter gave me any pleasure, though some one has written to me saying:\r\n\"Considering the evil days, I am pretty comfortable at Patrae, and I\r\nshould be more so, if your brother would speak of you as I should like\r\nto hear him.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 404\r\n\r\nsibi nullas litteras remittere, semel ab ipso accepi.

Circumstances suggest that she ought to make\r\nprovision for satisfying her creditors. I hear from Philotimus that she\r\nis doing some underhand things. I can hardly believe it; but anyhow, if\r\nthere is anything of the kind (and there possibly may be), it ought to\r\nbe guarded against. Please write to me about everything, and especially\r\nwhat you think about her.

For I have\r\ngot a letter from you in which you seem to doubt whether I received\r\nthose letters. I wish they had never been delivered: for they increased\r\nmy sorrow, and, if they had fallen into anyone's hands, they would\r\nnot have told them anything new. For his hatred of me and the kind of\r\nletters he writes are common knowledge. Even Caesar, when he sent them\r\nto your friends, seems to have done it, not to show his annoyance at\r\nQuintus' disgraceful conduct, but, I suppose, to make my misfortunes\r\nbetter known. You say you are afraid they may do Quintus some harm, and\r\nyou are trying to remedy it. Why, Caesar did not even wait to be asked\r\nabout him. That does not annoy me: what is more annoying is that the\r\nfavours granted to me have no sterling value.\r\n\r\nSulla, I believe, will be here to-morrow with Messalla. They are\r\nhurrying to him, hounded away by the soldiers, who refuse to go\r\nanywhere, until they get their pay. So, though people thought he would\r\nnot, he will be coming here; but not in a hurry. For he is travelling\r\nslowly, and he is stopping many days in each town. Then, however he\r\nmanages things, Pharnaces must delay him. So what do you think about\r\nme? For already I am scarcely capable physically of bearing this bad\r\nclimate, which adds ill-health to my troubles.

The other thing too I wish I had attended\r\nto before; but I was afraid of everything. In this very bad business\r\nthere was nothing better than a divorce. I should have done something\r\nlike a man, either on the score of his cancelling of debts or his\r\nnight attacks on houses, or Metella or all his sins together: I should\r\nnot have lost the money, and I should have shown some manly spirit. I\r\nremember of course your letter, but I remember the circumstances too:\r\nstill anything would have been better than this. Now he seems to be\r\ngiving notice of divorce himself; for I have heard about the statue of\r\nClodius. To think that a son-in-law of mine above all people should do\r\nsuch a thing as that, or abolish debts! So I agree with you we must\r\nserve a notice of divorce on him. Perhaps he will ask for the third\r\ninstalment of the dowry. So consider whether we should wait for a move\r\nof his or act first.[196] If I can possibly manage it, even by night\r\njourneys, I will try to see you.

So I must put up with that. And when I have\r\nborne that blow, I shall still have to suffer what you warn me to guard\r\nagainst. For I have got myself into such trouble, that, whatever the\r\nstate of affairs or the feelings of the people may be, the result for\r\nme apparently will be the same.\r\n\r\nBut here I take the pen myself; for I shall have to deal with\r\nconfidential matters. Please see to the will even now, as it was made\r\nwhen she had begun to get into difficulties. She did not bother you, I\r\nthink; for she did not even ask me about it. But, supposing that is so,\r\nsince you have broached the subject already, you will be able to advise\r\nher to deposit it with some one whose position is not affected by this\r\nwar. Myself I would rather you were the person, if she agrees to that.\r\nThe fact is I am keeping the poor woman in the dark as to that fear of\r\nmine.[197]\r\n\r\n[197] That her property would be confiscated.\r\n\r\nFor that other matter, I know of course that nothing can be put up for\r\nsale now, but things could be put away and hidden, so that they escape\r\nthe crash which is threatening. For, when you\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 424\r\n\r\net tua Tulliae fore parata, tua credo, nostra quae poterunt esse?

Epheso qui veniunt, ibi se eum\r\nde suis controversiis in ius adeuntem vidisse nuntiant; quae quidem\r\n(ita enim veri simile est) in adventum Caesaris fortasse reiciuntur.\r\nIta aut nihil puto eum habere, quod putet ad me celerius perferendum,\r\naut adeo me in malis esse despectum, ut, etiamsi quid habet, id nisi\r\nomnibus suis negotiis confectis ad me referre non curet. Ex quo magnum\r\nequidem capio dolorem, sed non tantum, quantum videor debere. Nihil\r\nenim mea minus interesse puto, quam quid illinc adferatur.

Now as to Terentia, I omit\r\nlots of other things, for what can one add to this? You wrote to her\r\nto remit me by bill of exchange £100, saying that was the balance. She\r\nsent me 80 guineas,[198] adding that that was all the balance. If she\r\npurloins so trifling an amount from so small a total, you can see what\r\nshe has been doing in the case of larger sums.\r\n\r\n[198] 12,000 and 10,000 sesterces respectively.\r\n\r\nNot a trace of Philotimus as yet: nay, he has not even informed me by\r\nletter or messenger what he has done. Those who come from Ephesus say\r\nthey saw him there going into court about some lawsuits of his own,\r\nwhich possibly--indeed in all probability--are deferred till Caesar's\r\narrival. So I suppose he either has nothing which he thinks he need\r\nhurry to bring to me, or I have sunk so low in my misfortunes that,\r\neven if he has, he does not take the trouble to bring it until he\r\nhas finished all his own business. And that causes me considerable\r\nannoyance, but not so much as I think it ought. For I don't think\r\nanything matters much less to me than what answer he brings back from\r\nthat quarter. Why, I am quite sure you know.\r\n\r\nYou advise me to mould my looks and words according to circumstances.\r\nIt is difficult, but I would put a rein on myself, if I thought it\r\nmattered to me at all. You say you think the African business can be\r\narranged by an interchange of letters: I wish you would say, why you\r\nthink so: for I can't imagine any reason for thinking it possible.\r\nHowever please write to me, if there is anything that would give me\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 426\r\n\r\nhabeat, scribas ad me; sin, ut perspicio, nihil erit, scribas id ipsum.\r\nEgo ad te, si quid audiero citius, scribam.

For none of my misfortunes\r\nhas come upon me by fate--that would have been endurable--but I\r\nhave brought all on myself by my mistakes and my mental and bodily\r\nafflictions, which I only wish my nearest and dearest had thought\r\nfit to remedy. So, as there is no hope of any advice from you or any\r\nconsolation, I will not ask for them henceforth: only please do not\r\ncease from writing to me anything that may occur to you, when you have\r\nanyone to send it by, and so long as there is anyone to send it to;\r\nwhich will not be long.\r\n\r\nThere is a rumour, though not a very certain one, that Caesar has left\r\nAlexandria. It came first from a letter of Sulpicius, and has been\r\nconfirmed by all subsequent messengers. Whether to prefer it to be\r\nfalse or true, I don't know, as it does not matter to me.\r\n\r\nAs I told you already about the will I should like it to be preserved\r\nin a safe place.[200] I am worn out and harassed by the infatuation of\r\nmy unhappy daughter. I don't think there ever was such a child\r\n\r\n[200] This seems to be the sense, though the reading is doubtful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Page 428\r\n\r\numquam simile natum puto.

Te oro, ut in perditis\r\nrebus si quid cogi, confici potest, quod sit in tuto, ex argento atque\r\nsatis multa ex supellectile, des operam. Iam enim mihi videtur adesse\r\nextremum nec ulla fore condicio pacis eaque, quae sunt, etiam sine\r\nadversario peritura. Haec etiam, si videbitur, cum Terentia loquere\r\nopportune.

If I can do anything for her in any way, I wish you\r\nwould suggest it to me. I see there will be the same difficulty as\r\nthere was before in giving me advice: but this causes me more anxiety\r\nthan anything. It was blind of me to pay the second instalment. I wish\r\nI had not: but that is over and done with. I beg you to do your best,\r\nas it is in the last extremity, to collect and get together what you\r\ncan from the sale of plate and furniture, of which there is a good\r\ndeal, and put it in a safe place. For now I think the end is near,\r\nthere will be no peace negotiations, and the present government will\r\ncollapse even without an adversary. As to this speak to Terentia too at\r\nyour convenience, if you think fit. I cannot write everything.
