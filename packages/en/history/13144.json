In point of fact there is often as much\r\nmaterial for reconstructing the life of some quite ordinary person as\r\nthere is for writing a history of Robert of Normandy or of Philippa of\r\nHainault; and the lives of ordinary people so reconstructed are, if less\r\nspectacular, certainly not less interesting. I believe that social\r\nhistory lends itself particularly to what may be called a personal\r\ntreatment, and that the past may be made to live again for the general\r\nreader more effectively by personifying it than by presenting it in the\r\nform of learned treatises on the development of the manor or on medieval\r\ntrade, essential as these are to the specialist. For history, after all,\r\nis valuable only in so far as it lives, and Maeterlinck's cry, 'There\r\nare no dead', should always be the historian's motto. It is the idea\r\nthat history is about dead people, or, worse still, about movements and\r\nconditions which seem but vaguely related to the labours and passions of\r\nflesh and blood, which has driven history from bookshelves where the\r\nhistorical novel still finds a welcome place.\r\n\r\nIn the following series of sketches I have tried to illustrate at the\r\nsame time various aspects of social life in the Middle Ages and various\r\nclasses of historical material. Thus Bodo illustrates peasant life, and\r\nan early phase of a typical medieval estate; Marco Polo, Venetian trade\r\nwith the East; Madame Eglentyne, monastic life; the Ménagier's wife,\r\ndomestic life in a middle-class home, and medieval ideas about women;\r\nThomas Betson, the wool trade, and the activities of the great English\r\ntrading company of Merchants of the Staple; and Thomas Paycocke, the\r\ncloth industry in East Anglia. They are all quite ordinary people and\r\nunknown to fame, with the exception of Marco Polo. The types of\r\nhistorical evidence illustrated are the estate book of a manorial lord,\r\nthe chronicle and traveller's tale, the bishop's register, the didactic\r\ntreatise in household management, the collection of family letters, and\r\nhouses, brasses, and wills. At the end of the book I have added a\r\nbibliography of the sources which form the raw material for my\r\nreconstructions, and a few additional notes and references. I hope that\r\nthis modest attempt to bring to life again some of 'our fathers that\r\nbegat us', may perhaps interest for an hour or two the general reader,\r\nor the teacher, who wishes to make more concrete by personification some\r\nof the general facts of medieval social and economic history.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to my publishers, Messrs. Methuen and Co., for\r\nallowing me to incorporate in Chapter VI the greater part of a chapter\r\nin my book 'The Paycockes of Coggeshall', and to the Cambridge\r\nUniversity Press for similarly allowing me to repeat in Chapter III a\r\nfew sentences from my study of 'Medieval English Nunneries'. I have also\r\nto thank my friends Miss M.G. Jones and Miss H.M.R. Murray of Girton\r\nCollege, Cambridge, for various suggestions and criticisms, and my\r\nsister Miss Rhoda Power for making the index.\r\n\r\n  _May 1924_                           EILEEN POWER\r\n        _London School of Economics and Political Science\r\n                   University of London_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Preface to the Tenth Edition_\r\n\r\nFor years after the first edition of _Medieval People_ had come out,\r\nEileen Power collected notes and made plans for several essays to be\r\nincluded in an enlarged edition of the book. Of these essays only one,\r\n\"The Precursors\", had been written out in full before she died; and it\r\nhas now been added to the present edition. In its published form it is\r\nnot in every respect identical with the author's original text.\r\n\r\nThe essay was taking shape as Munich came and went and as the war itself\r\nwas drawing near. No historian writing at that time about Rome menaced\r\nby the barbarians--and least of all an historian as sensitive to the\r\nextra-mural world as Eileen Power was--could have helped noting the\r\nsimilarities between the Roman Empire in the fifth or sixth centuries\r\nand Europe in the nineteen-thirties. In the end, having finished the\r\nessay, she decided to withold it from publication for the time being and\r\nto present it instead to a friendly audience as a tract for the times.\r\nThis she did at a meeting of the Cambridge History Club in the winter of\r\n1938: and for that occasion she replaced the opening and concluding\r\npages of the original essay with passages, or rather notes for passages,\r\nmore suited to the purpose.\r\n\r\nI am sure that she never intended these passages to be perpetuated in\r\nher _Medieval People_ and I have therefore done what I could to replace\r\nthem with a reconstructed version of her first draft. The reconstruction\r\nhad to be done from somewhat disjointed notes and cannot therefore be\r\nword-faithful. The readers must therefore bear in mind that the first\r\ntwo and the last page of the essay are mere approximations to what\r\nEileen Power in fact wrote.\r\n\r\n_April_, 1963 M.M.

ROME IN DECLINE\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy knows that the Middle Ages arose on the ruins of the\r\nRoman Empire. The decline of Rome preceded and in some ways prepared the\r\nrise of the kingdoms and cultures which composed the medieval system.\r\nYet in spite of the self-evident truth of this historical preposition we\r\nknow little about life and thought in the watershed years when Europe\r\nwas ceasing to be Roman but was not yet medieval. We do not know how it\r\nfelt to watch the decline of Rome; we do not even know whether the men\r\nwho watched it knew what they saw, though we can be quite certain that\r\nnone of them foretold, indeed could have foreseen, the shape which the\r\nworld was to take in later centuries.\r\n\r\nYet the tragic story, its main themes and protagonists were for all to\r\nsee. No observer should have failed to notice that the Roman Empire of\r\nthe fourth and fifth centuries was no longer the Roman Empire of the\r\ngreat Antonine and Augustan age; that it had lost its hold over its\r\nterritories and its economic cohesion and was menaced by the barbarians\r\nwho were in the end to overwhelm it. The territory of the Roman Empire\r\nhad at its height stretched from the lands bordering the North Sea to\r\nthe lands on the northern fringes of the Sahara, and from the Atlantic\r\ncoast of Europe to the central Asiatic Steppes; it comprised most of the\r\nregions of the former Hellenic, Iranian, and Phoenician empires, and it\r\neither ruled or kept in check great clusters of peoples and\r\nprincipalities beyond its Gallic and north African frontiers. From these\r\nfarthest frontiers Rome of the fourth century had retreated and was\r\nstill retreating.\r\n\r\nWithin its frontiers great currents of inter-regional commerce had in\r\nearlier centuries flowed along the routes which bound all the provinces\r\nof the Empire to Rome and most of the provinces to each other. But from\r\nthe third century onwards the economic unity of the Empire was in\r\ndissolution, and by the fifth century most of the great currents of\r\ninter-regional trade had ceased to flow, and provinces and districts had\r\nbeen thrown upon themselves and their own resources. And with the wealth\r\nof the provinces reduced, their commerce restricted, the great\r\nprovincial cities also declined in population, wealth, political power.\r\n\r\nYet to its very last days the Empire endeavoured to defend its frontiers\r\nagainst the converging barbarians. Not only did the Barbarian Conquests,\r\nlike all conquests, threaten destruction and ruin, but the way of life\r\nthe barbarians stood for was the very denial of what Roman civilization\r\nhad been, though alas, was gradually ceasing to be.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not in material things, that the contemporaries found,\r\nor should have found the sharpest conflict between Rome and the\r\nbarbarian prospects before it. Above all Roman civilization was a\r\ncivilization of the mind. It had behind it a long tradition of thought\r\nand of intellectual achievement, the legacy of Greece, to which it had\r\nin turn made its own contribution. The Roman world was a world of\r\nschools and universities, writers, and builders. The barbarian world was\r\na world in which mind was in its infancy and its infancy was long. The\r\nbattle sagas of the race, which have all but disappeared or have\r\nsurvived only as legends worked up in a later age; the few rude laws\r\nwhich were needed to regulate personal relationships, this was hardly\r\ncivilization in the Roman sense. King Chilperic, trying to make verses\r\nin the style of Sedulius, though he could not distinguish between a long\r\nfoot and a short and they all hobbled; Charlemagne himself, going to bed\r\nwith his slate under his pillow in order to practice in the watches of\r\nthe night that art of writing which he never mastered; what have they in\r\ncommon with Julius Caesar and Marcus Aurelius and that great Julian\r\ncalled the Apostate? They sum up in their very persons the whole wide\r\ngulf that yawned between Germany and Rome.\r\n\r\nRome and the barbarians were thus not only protagonists but two\r\ndifferent attitudes to life, civilization and barbarism. We cannot here\r\ndiscuss in detail the question as to why, in the clash between the two,\r\nit was civilization which perished and barbarism which prevailed. But it\r\nis important to remember that while the Empire tried to defend its\r\nfrontiers against the barbarian hosts, it gradually opened them to\r\nbarbarian settlers.\r\n\r\nThis peaceful infiltration of barbarians which altered the whole\r\ncharacter of the society which it invaded would have been impossible, of\r\ncourse, if that society had not been stricken by disease. The disease is\r\nplain enough to see by the third century. It shows itself in those\r\ninternecine civil wars in which civilization rends itself, province\r\nagainst province and army against army. It shows itself in the great\r\ninflationary crisis from about 268 and in the taxation which gradually\r\ncrushed out the smaller bourgeoisie while the fortunes of the rich\r\nescaped its net. It shows itself in the gradual sinking back of an\r\neconomy based upon free exchange into more and more primitive conditions\r\nwhen every province seeks to be self-sufficient and barter takes the\r\nplace of trade. It shows itself in the decline of farming and in the\r\nworkless city population kept quiet by their dole of bread and their\r\ncircuses, whose life contrasted so dramatically, so terribly with that\r\nof the haughty senatorial families and the great landowners in their\r\npalatial villas and town houses. It shows itself in the rise of mystical\r\nfaiths on the ruins of philosophy, and of superstition (more especially\r\nastrology) on the ruins of reason. One religion in particular grew\r\nmighty, by clasping its sacred book and addressing itself with words of\r\nhope to the victims of social injustice, but although it was able to\r\nbring comfort to individuals it could do nothing, indeed it did not try,\r\nto give new strength or inspiration to the embattled civilization. True\r\nto its own ethos it was impartial as between Barbarian and Roman, or\r\nbetween the Romans who prospered and ruled and those outside the pale.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious manifestation of Roman society in decline was the\r\ndwindling numbers of Roman citizens. The Empire was being depopulated\r\nlong before the end of the period of peace and prosperity which\r\nstretched from Augustus to Marcus Aurelius. Does not Augustus himself\r\nsummon the poor man of Fiesole who has a family of eight children,\r\nthirty-six grandchildren and eighteen great grandchildren, and organize\r\nin his honour a fête in the Capitol, accompanied by a great deal of\r\npublicity? Does not Tacitus, half-anthropologist and half-Rousseau,\r\ndescribing the noble savage with his eye on fellow citizens, remark that\r\namong the Germans it is accounted a shameful thing to limit the number\r\nof your children? The long duration of Augustus's legislation to raise\r\nthe birthrate is significant; successful it was not, but the fact that\r\nit was maintained on the statute book and systematically revised and\r\ndeveloped for three centuries shows that it was at least accounted\r\nnecessary. It is true of course that the mortality rate was a far more\r\nimportant factor in those days than it is in our own, and the mortality\r\nfrom pestilence and civil war from Marcus Aurelius onwards was\r\nexceptional. And it is plain that the proportion of celibates was high\r\nin the Roman empire and that the fall in the fertility of marriages was\r\ngoing on. It is the childless marriage, the small family system that\r\ncontemporary writers deplore. In Seeley's striking phrase: 'The human\r\nharvest was bad,' It was bad in all classes, but the decline was most\r\nmarked in the upper ranks, the most educated, the most civilized, the\r\npotential leaders of the race. In the terrible words of Swift, facing\r\nhis own madness, the Roman Empire might have cried: 'I shall die like a\r\ntree--from the top downwards.'\r\n\r\nWhy (the insistent question forces itself) did this civilization lose\r\nthe power to reproduce itself? Was it, as Polybius said, because people\r\npreferred amusements to children or wished to bring their children up in\r\ncomfort? Hardly, for it is more marked among the rich than the poor and\r\nthe rich can have the best of both worlds. Was it because people had\r\ngrown discouraged and disheartened, no longer believing in their own\r\ncivilization and loath to bring children into the darkness and disaster\r\nof their war-shattered world? We do not know. But we can see the\r\nconnection of the falling population with the other evils of the\r\nempire--the heavy cost of administration relatively heavier when the\r\ndensity of the population is low; the empty fields, the dwindling\r\nlegions which did not suffice to guard the frontier.\r\n\r\nTo cure this sickness of population the Roman rulers knew no other way\r\nthan to dose it with barbarian vigour. Just a small injection to begin\r\nwith and then more and more till in the end the blood that flowed in its\r\nveins was not Roman but barbarian. In came the Germans to settle the\r\nfrontier, to till the fields, to enlist first in the auxiliaries and\r\nthen in the legions, to fill the great offices of state. The army is\r\nbarbarized, and a modern writer, Mr Moss, has quoted most effectively\r\nthe complaint of the Egyptian mother clamouring to get back her son who\r\n(as she says) has gone off with the barbarians--he means that he has\r\nenlisted in the Roman legions. The legions are barbarized and they\r\nbarbarize the Emperor. For them he is no longer the majestic embodiment\r\nof law, he is their leader, their Führer, and they raise him on their\r\nshields. And side by side with the barbarization of the army goes the\r\nbarbarization of civil manners too. In 397 Honorius has to pass an edict\r\nforbidding the wearing of German fashions within the precincts of Rome.\r\nAnd in the end, half barbarian themselves, they have only barbarians to\r\ndefend them against barbarism.\r\n\r\nSuch was the general picture of the great ruin of civilization amidst\r\nwhich the Romans of the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries lived. What\r\nthen did it feel like to live at a time when civilization was going down\r\nbefore the forces of barbarism? Did people realize what was happening?\r\nDid the gloom of the Dark Ages cast its shadow before? It so happens\r\nthat we can answer these questions very clearly if we fix our eyes on\r\none particular part of the Empire, the famous and highly civilized\r\nprovince of Gaul. We can catch the decline at three points because in\r\nthree consecutive centuries, Gallo-Roman writers have left us a picture\r\nof their life and times. In the fourth century we have Ausonius, in the\r\nfifth Sidonius Apollinarius, in the sixth Gregory of Tours and\r\nFortunatus, a stranger from Italy, who made his home in Poitiers. They\r\nshow us Auvergne and the Bordelais in the evening light. The fourth, the\r\nfifth, and the sixth centuries--going, going, gone!\r\n\r\n2. AUSONIUS\r\n\r\nGoing! This is the world of Ausonius, south-western France in the latter\r\nhalf of the fourth century, 'an Indian summer between ages of storm and\r\nwreckage'. Ausonius himself is a scholar and a gentleman, the friend\r\nalike of the pagan Symmachus and of St Paulinus of Nela. He is for\r\nthirty years professor of rhetoric in the university of Bordeaux, for\r\nsome time tutor to a prince, praetorian prefect of Gaul, consul, and in\r\nhis last years just an old man contentedly living on his estates. His\r\nmost famous poem is a description of the Moselle, which for all its\r\nliterary affectations evokes most magically the smiling countryside\r\nwhich was the background of his life. High above the river on either\r\nbank stand the villas and country houses, with their courts and lawns\r\nand pillared porticos, and the hot baths from which, if you will, you\r\ncan plunge into the stream. The sunny hillside is covered with vines,\r\nand from slope to hill-top the husbandmen call to each other and the\r\nwayfarer on the towpath or the bargemen floating by, shout their rude\r\njests to the loitering vinedressers. Far out in midstream the fisherman\r\ntrails his dripping net and on a rock by the shore the angler plies his\r\nrod. And, as twilight falls, the deepening shadow of the green hillside\r\nis reflected in the water and gazing downward the boatman can almost\r\ncount the trembling vines and almost see the swelling of the grapes.\r\n\r\nEqually peaceful, equally pleasant is life on Ausonius' own estate in\r\nthe Bordelais, his little patrimony (he calls it) although he had a\r\nthousand acres of vineyard and tillage and wood. Miss Waddell has\r\nreminded us, on the authority of Saintsbury (whom else?) that 'to this\r\nday it boasts itself as Château-Ausone, one of the two best of the St\r\nEmilion clarets.' Here he tends his roses and sends his boy round to the\r\nneighbours to bid them to luncheon, while he interviews the cook. Six,\r\nincluding the host, is the right number--if more it is not a meal but a\r\nmelée. Then there are all his relatives to be commemorated in verse, his\r\ngrandfather and his grandmother and his sisters and his cousins and his\r\naunts (especially his aunts).\r\n\r\nAnd when the family circle palls there is the senior common room to fall\r\nback upon and the professors of Bordeaux to be celebrated in their turn.\r\nProfessors were important people in the empire of the fourth century;\r\nSymmachus says that it is the mark of a flourishing state that good\r\nsalaries should be paid to professors; though what exactly we are to\r\ndeduce from that in the light of history I should hesitate to say. So\r\nAusonius writes a collection of poems about the professors of Bordeaux.\r\nThere are thirty-two of them and all are celebrated. There is Minervius\r\nthe orator, who had a prodigious memory and after a game of backgammon\r\nwas wont to conduct a post-mortem over every move. There is Anastasius\r\nthe grammarian, who was so foolish as to leave Bordeaux for a provincial\r\nuniversity and thenceforth languished in well-merited obscurity. There\r\nis Attius Tiro Delphidius, who retired from a legal career into the\r\nprofessorial chair, but could never be got to take any trouble with his\r\nmen, to the disappointment of their parents. There is Jocundus the\r\ngrammarian, who did not really deserve his title, but was such a kind\r\nman that we will commemorate him among men of worth, although he was,\r\nstrictly speaking, unequal to the job. There is Exuperius, who was very\r\ngood-looking and whose eloquence sounded superb until you examined it\r\nand found that it meant nothing. There is Dynamius, who slipped from the\r\npaths of virtue with a married lady in Bordeaux and left the place\r\nrather hastily, but fortunately fell on his feet in Spain. There is\r\nVictorius the usher, who liked only the most abstruse historical\r\nproblems, such as what the pedigree of the sacrificial priest at Cureo\r\nwas long before Numa's day, or what Castor had to say on all the shadowy\r\nkings, and who never got up as far as Tully or Virgil, though he might\r\nhave done so if he had gone on reading long enough, but death cut him\r\noff too soon. They seem oddly familiar figures (except of course,\r\nDynamius) and their chronicler contrives to make them live.\r\n\r\nSuch is the world depicted for us by Ausonius. But while this pleasant\r\ncountry house and senior common room life was going calmly on, what do\r\nwe find happening in the history books? Ausonius was a man of nearly\r\nfifty when the Germans swarmed across the Rhine in 357, pillaging\r\nforty-five flourishing cities, and pitching their camps on the banks of\r\nthe Moselle. He had seen the great Julian take up arms ('O Plato, Plato,\r\nwhat a task for a philosopher') and in a series of brilliant campaigns\r\ndrive them out again. Ten years later when he was tutor to Gratian he\r\nhad himself accompanied the emperor Valentinian on another campaign\r\nagainst the same foes. While he was preening himself on his consulship\r\nten years later still, he must have heard of the disastrous battle of\r\nAdrianople in the east, when the Goths defeated a Roman army and slew an\r\nemperor. He died in 395 and within twelve years of his death the host of\r\nGermans had burst across the Rhine, 'all Gaul was a smoking funeral\r\npyre', and the Goths were at the gates of Rome. And what have Ausonius\r\nand his correspondents to say about this? Not a word. Ausonius and\r\nSymmachus and their set ignore the barbarians as completely as the\r\nnovels of Jane Austen ignore the Napoleonic wars.\r\n\r\n3. SIDONIUS APOLLINARIS\r\n\r\nGoing, going.... Some thirty-five years after the death of Ausonius, in\r\nthe midst of the disastrous sixth century, was born Sidonius\r\nApollinaris, Gallo-Roman aristocrat, father-in-law of an emperor,\r\nsometime prefect of Rome and in the end Bishop of Clermont. Sidonius\r\nApollinaris, 431 (or thereabouts) to 479 or perhaps a few years later.\r\nMuch had happened between the death of Ausonius and his birth. The\r\nlights were going out all over Europe. Barbarian kingdoms had been\r\nplanted in Gaul and Spain, Rome herself had been sacked by the Goths;\r\nand in his lifetime the collapse went on, ever more swiftly. He was a\r\nyoung man of twenty when the ultimate horror broke upon the West, the\r\ninroad of Attila and the Huns. That passed away, but when he was\r\ntwenty-four the Vandals sacked Rome. He saw the terrible German\r\nking-maker Ricimer throne and unthrone a series of puppet emperors, he\r\nsaw the last remnant of Gallic independence thrown away and himself\r\nbecome a barbarian subject, and he saw a few years before he died the\r\nfall of the empire in the west.\r\n\r\nThey cannot, Sidonius and his friends, ignore as Ausonius and his\r\nfriends did, that something is happening to the empire. The men of the\r\nfifth century are concerned at these disasters and they console\r\nthemselves, each according to his kind. There are some who think it\r\ncannot last. After all, they say, the empire has been in a tight place\r\nbefore and has always got out of it in the end and risen supreme over\r\nits enemies. Thus Sidonius himself, the very year after they sacked the\r\ncity; Rome has endured as much before--there was Porsenna, there was\r\nBrennus, there was Hannibal.... Only that time Rome did not get over it.\r\nOthers tried to use the disasters to castigate the sins of society. Thus\r\nSalvian of Marseilles who would no doubt have been called the gloomy\r\ndean if he had not been a bishop. For him all that the decadent Roman\r\ncivilization needs is to copy some of the virtues of these fresh young\r\nbarbarian people. There is the familiar figure of Orosius, defending the\r\nbarbarians with the argument that when the Roman empire was founded it\r\nwas founded in blood and conquest and can ill afford to throw stones at\r\nthe barbarians; and after all the barbarians are not so bad. 'If the\r\nunhappy people they have despoiled will content themselves with the\r\nlittle that is left them, their conquerors will cherish them as friends\r\nand brothers.' Others, especially the more thoughtful churchmen are much\r\nconcerned to explain why an empire which had flourished under paganism\r\nshould be thus beset under Christianity. Others desert the Empire\r\naltogether and (like St Augustine) put their hope in a city not made\r\nwith hands--though Ambrose, it is true, let fall the pregnant\r\nobservation that it was not the will of God that his people should be\r\nsaved by logic-chopping. 'It has not pleased God to save his people by\r\ndialectic.'\r\n\r\nAnd how were they living? We have only to read the letters written by\r\nSidonius during the period between 460 and 470, when he was living on\r\nhis estate in Auvergne, to realize that on the surface all is going on\r\nexactly as before. Gaul is shrunk, it is true, to a mere remnant between\r\nthree barbarian kingdoms, but save for that we might be back in the days\r\nof Ausonius. There is the luxurious villa, with its hot baths and\r\nswimming pool, its suites of rooms, its views over the lake; and there\r\nis Sidonius inviting his friends to stay with him or sending\r\nround his compositions to the professors and the bishops and the\r\ncountry-gentlemen. Sport and games are very popular--Sidonius rides and\r\nswims and hunts and plays tennis. In one letter he tells his\r\ncorrespondent that he has been spending some days in the country with\r\nhis cousin and an old friend, whose estates adjoin each other. They had\r\nsent out scouts to catch him and bring him back for a week and took it\r\nin turns to entertain him. There are games of tennis on the lawn before\r\nbreakfast or backgammon for the older men. There is an hour or two in\r\nthe library before we sit down to an excellent luncheon followed by a\r\nsiesta. Then we go out riding and return for a hot bath and a plunge in\r\nthe river. I should like to describe our luscious dinner parties, he\r\nconcludes, but I have no more paper. However, come and stay with us and\r\nyou shall hear all about it. Clearly this is no Britain, where in the\r\nsixth century half-barbarian people camped in the abandoned villas and\r\ncooked their food on the floors of the principal rooms.\r\n\r\nAnd yet ... it had gone a long way downhill since the days of Ausonius,\r\nand Sidonius could not now ignore the very existence of the barbarians.\r\nHe has indeed left notable protraits of them, especially of the king of\r\nthe Visigoths and of the Burgundians who ruled Lyons, where he was born.\r\nWhenever he went to stay there, he complains, they flocked about him in\r\nembarrassing friendliness, breathing leeks and onions and dressing their\r\nhair with rancid butter (they were not, it appears, constrained to\r\nchoose between spears and butter). How can he compose six foot metres,\r\nhe asks, with so many seven foot patrons around him, all singing and all\r\nexpecting him to admire their uncouth stream of non-Latin words? The\r\nshrug of the shoulder, the genial contempt of one conscious of an\r\ninfinite superiority--how clear it is. One is reminded of a verse\r\nof Verlaine\r\n\r\nJe suis l'empire a la fin de la decadence\r\nqui regarde passer les grands barbares blancs\r\n\r\nBut Sidonius's good nature was to be rudely shaken. All barbarians were\r\nnot friendly giants, and the Visigoths next door, under their new king\r\nEuric, turned covetous eyes upon Auvergne. Sidonius had not been two\r\nyears bishop of Clermont before he had to organize the defence of the\r\ncity against their attack. The Avernians stood out gallantly; they would\r\nfight and they would starve, but they would defend this last stronghold\r\nof Rome in Gaul. But they were a small people; to resist successfully\r\nthey must have help from Rome itself. Lest anyone should suspect me of\r\ntwisting the story, I give it in the words of Sidonius's editor, writing\r\ntwenty years ago.\r\n\r\n     Julius Nepos was alive to the danger that Euric might cross\r\n     the Rhône; but weak as his resources were he could only hope\r\n     to secure peace by negotiation. The quaestor Licinianus had\r\n     been sent into Gaul to investigate the condition of affairs\r\n     on the spot.... He had now returned and it was soon only too\r\n     clear that hopes based on his intervention were not likely\r\n     to be fulfilled. We find Sidonius writing for information....\r\n     He began to fear that something was going on behind his back,\r\n     and that the real danger to Auvergne came no longer from\r\n     determined enemies but from pusillanimous friends. His\r\n     suspicions were only too well founded. On receipt of the\r\n     quaestor's report a Council was held to determine the policy\r\n     of the Empire towards the Visigothic king.... The empire did\r\n     not feel strong enough to support Auvergne and it was decided\r\n     to cede the whole territory to Euric, apparently without\r\n     condition.\r\n\r\nThe despair of Sidonius knew no bounds and he writes a nobly indignant\r\nletter to a bishop who had been concerned in the negotiations:\r\n\r\n     The state of our unhappy region is miserable indeed. Everyone\r\n     declares that things were better in wartime than they are now\r\n     after peace has been concluded. Our enslavement was made the\r\n     price of security for a third party; the enslavement, ah--the\r\n     shame of it!, of those Avernians ... who in our own time\r\n     stood forth alone to stay the advance of the common enemy....\r\n     These are the men whose common soldiers were as good as\r\n     captains, but who never reaped the benefit of their\r\n     victories: that was handed over for your consolation, while\r\n     all the crushing burden of defeat they had to bear\r\n     themselves.... This is to be our reward for braving\r\n     destitution, fire, sword and pestilence, for fleshing our\r\n     swords in the enemy's blood and going ourselves starved into\r\n     battle. This is the famous peace we dreamed of, when we tore\r\n     the grass from the crannies in the walls to eat.... For all\r\n     these proofs of our devotion, it would seem that we are to be\r\n     made a sacrifice. If it be so, may you live to blush for a\r\n     peace without either honour or advantage.\r\n\r\nAuvergne had been sacrificed to save Rome. But Rome was not to enjoy her\r\npeace with honour for long. These things took place in 475; and in 476\r\nthe last emperor was desposed by his barbarian bear-leader, and the\r\nempire in the west came to an end. As for Sidonius, the Goths imprisoned\r\nhim for a time and before he could recover his estate he had to write a\r\npanegyric for King Euric (he who had written panegyrics for three Roman\r\nemperors). It is clear that the old country house life went on as\r\nbefore, though the men who exchanged letters and epigrams were now under\r\nbarbarian rule. But in one letter shortly before his death there breaks\r\nfrom Sidonius a single line in which he unpacks his heart. _O\r\nneccessitas abjecta nascendi, vivendi misera dura moriendi._ 'O\r\nhumiliating necessity of birth, sad necessity of living, hard necessity\r\nof dying.' Shortly after 479 he died and within twenty years Clovis had\r\nembarked upon his career of conquest and Theodoric was ruler of Italy.\r\n\r\n4. FORTUNATUS AND GREGORY OF TOURS\r\n\r\nGoing, going, gone.... There is only the time and only the heart to look\r\nfor a moment at the Frankish kingdom which once was Gaul, and to survey\r\nthe world of Fortunatus and Gregory of Tours, born both of them just\r\nabout a century later than Sidonius, in the 530s. For a moment when you\r\nlook at Fortunatus you think the world of the sixth century is the same\r\nworld as that in which Sidonius entertained his friends with epigrams\r\nand tennis. Fortunatus, that versatile, gentle, genial, boot-licking\r\ngourmet, who somehow managed to write two of the most magnificent hymns\r\nof the Christian church, came from Italy on a visit to Gaul in 565 and\r\nnever left it again. He travelled all over the Frankish lands, in what\r\nhad been Germania as well as in what had been Gaul. From Trier to\r\nToulouse he made his way with ease by river and by road, and it might be\r\nAusonius again. Fortunatus too writes a poem on the Moselle; and there\r\nis the same smiling countryside with terraced vineyards sloping down to\r\nthe quiet stream and the smoke of villas rising from the woods.\r\nFortunatus too made the round of the country houses, especially of the\r\nsumptuous villas belonging to Leontius bishop of Bordeaux, a great\r\nGallo-Roman aristocrat, whose grandfather had been a friend of Sidonius.\r\nThe hot baths, the pillared porticos, the lawns sloping to the river,\r\nare all there; the feasts are even more magnificent (they upset\r\nFortunatus's digestion badly) and the talk is still of literature. The\r\nmore intelligent of the barbarian lords have imitated this refined and\r\nluxurious life as best they may. The Franks as well as the Gallo-Romans\r\nwelcome little eager Fortunatus; every count wants a set of Latin verses\r\ndedicated to himself. It is plain that some of the old country house\r\nlife at least has survived. The Apollinaris set still enjoys its hot\r\nbaths and its tennis; as Dill puts it, the barbarian might rule the\r\nland, but the laws of polite society would be administered as before.\r\n\r\nBut when you look again you realize that it is not the same. It is not\r\nmerely because we know that even these remnants of the social and\r\nmaterial civilization of Rome would soon themselves die away that the\r\ntragedy of the sixth century looms so dark. It is because when we look\r\nbelow the surface we see that the life has gone out of it all, the soul\r\nthat inflamed it is dead, nothing is now left but the empty shell. These\r\nmen welcome Fortunatus just because he comes from Italy, where the rot\r\nhas gone less far, where there still survives some reputation for\r\nlearning and for culture. They slake their nostalgia a little in the\r\npresence of that _enfant perdue_ of a lost civilization.\r\n\r\nFor this is the world of Gregory of Tours, of which you may read in his\r\n_History of the Franks_. The rule under which it lives is the rule of\r\nthe horrible Merovingian kings. Side by side with the villas barbarism\r\nspreads and flourishes like a jungle growth. Learning is dying--hardly\r\nthe ghost of a university is left--and Gregory himself who came of a\r\ngreat Gallo-Roman family and was a bishop bewails his ignorance of\r\ngrammar. The towns are shrinking, crouched behind their defences. The\r\nsynagogues are flaming, and the first step has been taken in that tragic\r\ntale of proscription and tallage, tallage and expulsion which (it seems)\r\nmust never end. As to politics, the will of the leader and his retinue\r\nis the rule of the Franks, and purge and bloodbath mark every stage in\r\nthe rivalry of the Merovingian princes. The worst of them are devils\r\nlike Chilperic and Fredegond, the best of them are still barbarians like\r\nthat King Guntram, who fills so many indulgent pages in Gregory of\r\nTours. He is a vaguely contemporary figure, a fat, voluble man, now\r\npurring with jovial good nature, now bursting into explosions of wrath\r\nand violence, a strange mixture of bonhomie and brutality. It is an\r\nironic commentary on what has happened to civilization that Gregory\r\nshould regard him with affection, that he should be known as 'Good King\r\nGuntram' and that the church should actually have canonized him after\r\nhis death. Good King Guntram; Michelet has summed him up in a phrase 'Ce\r\nbon roi à qui on ne reprochait que deux ou trois meurtres.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThese were the men who lived through the centuries of Roman fall and\r\nBarbarian triumph, and who by virtue of their elevated position, their\r\nlearning, and talents, should have seen, if not foretold, the course of\r\nevents. And yet as one contemplates the world of Ausonius and Sidonius\r\n(for by the time of Gregory of Tours it was already dead) one is, I\r\nthink, impelled to ask oneself the question why they were apparently so\r\nblind to what was happening. The big country houses go on having their\r\nluncheon and tennis parties, the little professors in the universities\r\ngo on giving their lectures and writing their books; games are\r\nincreasingly popular and the theatres are always full. Ausonius has seen\r\nthe Germans overrun Gaul once, but he never speaks of a danger that may\r\nrecur. Sidonius lives in a world already half barbarian, yet in the year\r\nbefore the Western Empire falls he is still dreaming of the consulship\r\nfor his son. Why did they not realize the magnitude of the disaster that\r\nwas befalling them? This is indeed a question almost as absorbing as the\r\nquestion why their civilization fell, for _au fond_ it is perhaps the\r\nsame question. Several answers may be suggested in explanation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the process of disintegration was a slow one, for the\r\nwhole tempo of life was slow and what might take decades in our own time\r\ntook centuries then. It is only because we can look back from the\r\nvantage point of a much later age that we can see the inexorable pattern\r\nwhich events are forming, so that we long to cry to these dead people\r\ndown the corridor of the ages, warning them to make a stand before it is\r\ntoo late, hearing no answering echo, 'Physician, heal thyself!' They\r\nsuffered from the fatal myopia of contemporaries. It was the affairs of\r\nthe moment that occupied them; for them it was the danger of the moment\r\nthat must be averted and they did not recognize that each compromise and\r\neach defeat was a link in the chain dragging them over the abyss.\r\n\r\nAt what point did barbarism within become a wasting disease? Yet from\r\nthe first skinclad German taken into a legion to the great barbarian\r\npatricians of Italy, making and unmaking emperors, the chain is\r\nunbroken. At what point in the assault from without did the attack\r\nbecome fatal? Was it the withdrawal from Dacia in 270--allow the\r\nbarbarians their sphere of influence in the east of Europe, fling them\r\nthe last-won recruit to Romania and they will be satiated and leave the\r\nwest alone? Was it the settlement of the Goths as _foederati_ within the\r\nEmpire in 382 and the beginning of that compromise between the Roman\r\nempire and the Germans which, as Bury says, masked the transition from\r\nthe rule of one to the rule of the other, from federate states within\r\nthe Empire to independent states replacing it? Was this policy of\r\nappeasement the fatal error? Was it the removal of the legions from\r\nBritain, a distant people (as a Roman senator might have said) of whom\r\nwe know nothing? Or was it that fatal combination of Spain and Africa,\r\nwhen the Vandals ensconced themselves in both provinces by 428 and the\r\nVandal fleet (with Majorca and the islands for its bases) cut off Rome\r\nfrom her corn supplies and broke the backbone of ancient civilization,\r\nwhich was the Mediterranean sea? Not once alone in the history of Europe\r\nhas the triumph of a hostile rule in Africa and Spain spelt disaster to\r\nour civilization.\r\n\r\nBut if the gradualness of this process misled the Romans there were\r\nother and equally potent reasons for their blindness. Most potent of all\r\nwas the fact that they mistook entirely the very nature of civilization\r\nitself. All of them were making the same mistake. People who thought\r\nthat Rome could swallow barbarism and absorb it into her life without\r\ndiluting her own civilization; the people who ran about busily saying\r\nthat the barbarians were not such bad fellows after all, finding good\r\npoints in their regime with which to castigate the Romans and crying\r\nthat except ye become as little barbarians ye shall not attain\r\nsalvation; the people who did not observe in 476 that one half of the\r\nRespublica Romanorum had ceased to exist and nourished themselves on the\r\nfiction that the barbarian kings were exercising a power delegated from\r\nthe Emperor. All these people were deluded by the same error, the belief\r\nthat Rome (the civilization of their age) was not a mere historical fact\r\nwith a beginning and an end, but a condition of nature like the air they\r\nbreathed and the earth they tread _Ave Roma immortalis_, most\r\nmagnificent most disastrous of creeds!\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Romans were blinded to what was happening to them\r\nby the very perfection of the material culture which they had created.\r\nAll around them was solidity and comfort, a material existence which was\r\nthe very antithesis of barbarism. How could they foresee the day when\r\nthe Norman chronicler would marvel over the broken hypocausts of\r\nCaerleon? How could they imagine that anything so solid might\r\nconceivably disappear? Their roads grew better as their statesmanship\r\ngrew worse and central heating triumphed as civilization fell.\r\n\r\nBut still more responsible for their unawareness was the educational\r\nsystem in which they were reared. Ausonius and Sidonius and their\r\nfriends were highly educated men and Gaul was famous for its schools and\r\nuniversities. The education which these gave consisted in the study of\r\ngrammar and rhetoric, which was necessary alike for the civil service\r\nand for polite society; and it would be difficult to imagine an\r\neducation more entirely out of touch with contemporary life, or less\r\nsuited to inculcate the qualities which might have enabled men to deal\r\nwith it. The fatal study of rhetoric, its links with reality long since\r\nsevered, concentrated the whole attention of men of intellect on form\r\nrather than on matter. The things they learned in their schools had no\r\nrelation to the things that were going on in the world outside and bred\r\nin them the fatal illusion that tomorrow would be as yesterday, that\r\neverything was the same, whereas everything was different.\r\n\r\nSo we take our leave of them. Going ... going ... gone! Gone altogether?\r\nPerhaps not. Hundreds of years of barbarism were to elapse before a new\r\nsociety arose capable of matching or even excelling Rome in material\r\nwealth, in arts, in sciences, and in gentler modes of existence--the\r\n_douceur de la vie_. We cannot say what date marked the moment of final\r\nrecovery, or who were the men who were to represent advancing\r\ncivilization as fully as Ausonius or Gregory of Tours represented\r\ncivilization in retreat: Dante, Shakespeare, Capernicus, Newton? But for\r\nmany centuries, perhaps a whole millennium, before western Europe scaled\r\nthe heights on which these men now stood, it had been gradually raising\r\nitself from the depths of post-Roman decline. The ascent was not only\r\nslow but also discontinuous, yet it was sufficient to establish within a\r\nfew centuries of Gregory of Tours a social order different from Rome and\r\nless glorious to behold across a thousand years of history, but\r\nnevertheless sufficiently exalted to draw the interest, and even to\r\ncommand the admiration of other still later ages. In that culture and in\r\nthat social order much of what Ausonius and Sidonius and even Fortunatus\r\nrepresented was brought to life again, albeit in a form they would not\r\nalways have recognized as their own. To this extent, at least, they were\r\nnot only the epigones of Rome but the true precursors of the\r\nMiddle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PEASANT BODO\r\n\r\nLIFE ON A COUNTRY ESTATE IN THE TIME OF CHARLEMAGNE\r\n\r\n\r\nThree slender things that best support the world: the slender stream of\r\nmilk from the cow's dug into the pail; the slender blade of green corn\r\nupon the ground; the slender thread over the hand of a skilled woman.\r\n\r\nThree sounds of increase: the lowing of a cow in milk; the din of a\r\nsmithy; the swish of a plough.\r\n\r\n                      --From _The Triads of Ireland_ (9th century)\r\n\r\n\r\nEconomic history, as we know it, is the newest of all the branches of\r\nhistory. Up to the middle of the last century the chief interest of the\r\nhistorian and of the public alike lay in political and constitutional\r\nhistory, in political events, wars, dynasties, and in political\r\ninstitutions and their development. Substantially, therefore, history\r\nconcerned itself with the ruling classes. 'Let us now praise famous\r\nmen,' was the historian's motto. He forgot to add 'and our fathers that\r\nbegat us'. He did not care to probe the obscure lives and activities of\r\nthe great mass of humanity, upon whose slow toil was built up the\r\nprosperity of the world and who were the hidden foundation of the\r\npolitical and constitutional edifice reared by the famous men he\r\npraised. To speak of ordinary people would have been beneath the dignity\r\nof history. Carlyle struck a significant note of revolt: 'The thing I\r\nwant to see,' he said, 'is not Red-book lists and Court Calendars and\r\nParliamentary Registers, but the Life of Man in England: what men did,\r\nthought, suffered, enjoyed.... Mournful, in truth, it is to behold what\r\nthe business called \"History\" in these so enlightened and illuminated\r\ntimes still continues to be. Can you gather from it, read till your eyes\r\ngo out, any dimmest shadow of an answer to that great question: How men\r\nlived and had their being; were it but economically, as, what wages they\r\ngot and what they bought with these? Unhappily you cannot.... History,\r\nas it stands all bound up in gilt volumes, is but a shade more\r\ninstructive than the wooden volumes of a backgammon-board.'\r\n\r\nCarlyle was a voice crying in the wilderness. Today the new history,\r\nwhose way he prepared, has come. The present age differs from the\r\ncenturies before it in its vivid realization of that much-neglected\r\nperson the man in the street; or (as it was more often in the earliest\r\nages) the man with the hoe. Today the historian is interested in the\r\nsocial life of the past and not only in the wars and intrigues of\r\nprinces. To the modern writer, the fourteenth century, for instance, is\r\nnot merely the century of the Hundred Years' War and of the Black Prince\r\nand Edward III; more significantly it is for him the era of the slow\r\ndecay of villeinage in England, a fact more epoch-making, in the long\r\nrun, than the struggle over our French provinces. We still praise famous\r\nmen, for he would be a poor historian who could spare one of the great\r\nfigures who have shed glory or romance upon the page of history; but we\r\npraise them with due recognition of the fact that not only great\r\nindividuals, but people as a whole, unnamed and undistinguished masses\r\nof people, now sleeping in unknown graves, have also been concerned in\r\nthe story. Our fathers that begat us have come to their own at last. As\r\nActon put it, 'The great historian now takes his meals in the kitchen.'\r\n\r\nThis book is chiefly concerned with the kitchens of History, and the\r\nfirst which we shall visit is a country estate at the beginning of the\r\nninth century. It so happens that we know a surprising amount about such\r\nan estate, partly because Charlemagne himself issued a set of orders\r\ninstructing the Royal stewards how to manage his own lands, telling them\r\neverything it was necessary for them to know, down to the vegetables\r\nwhich they were to plant in the garden. But our chief source of\r\nknowledge is a wonderful estate book which Irminon, the Abbot of St\r\nGermain des Prés near Paris, drew up so that the abbey might know\r\nexactly what lands belonged to it and who lived on those lands, very\r\nmuch as William I drew up an estate book of his whole kingdom and\r\ncalled it _Domesday Book_. In this estate book is set down the name of\r\nevery little estate (or _fisc_ as it was called) belonging to the abbey,\r\nwith a description of the land which was worked under its steward to its\r\nown profit, and the land which was held by tenants, and the names of\r\nthose tenants and of their wives and of their children, and the exact\r\nservices and rents, down to a plank and an egg, which they had to do for\r\ntheir land. We know today the name of almost every man, woman, and child\r\nwho was living on those little _fiscs_ in the time of Charlemagne, and a\r\ngreat deal about their daily lives.\r\n\r\nConsider for a moment how the estate upon which they lived was\r\norganized. The lands of the Abbey of St Germain were divided into a\r\nnumber of estates, called _fiscs_, each of a convenient size to be\r\nadministered by a steward. On each of these _fiscs_ the land was divided\r\ninto seigniorial and tributary lands; the first administered by the\r\nmonks through a steward or some other officer, and the second possessed\r\nby various tenants, who received and held them from the abbey. These\r\ntributary lands were divided into numbers of little farms, called\r\nmanses, each occupied by one or more families. If you had paid a visit\r\nto the chief or seigniorial manse, which the monks kept in their own\r\nhands, you would have found a little house, with three or four rooms,\r\nprobably built of stone, facing an inner court, and on one side of it\r\nyou would have seen a special group of houses hedged round, where the\r\nwomen serfs belonging to the house lived and did their work; all round\r\nyou would also have seen little wooden houses, where the household serfs\r\nlived, workrooms, a kitchen, a bakehouse, barns, stables, and other farm\r\nbuildings, and round the whole a hedge carefully planted with trees, so\r\nas to make a kind of enclosure or court. Attached to this central manse\r\nwas a considerable amount of land--ploughland, meadows, vineyards,\r\norchards, and almost all the woods or forests on the estate. Clearly a\r\ngreat deal of labour would be needed to cultivate all these lands. Some\r\nof that labour was provided by servile workers who were attached to the\r\nchief manse and lived in the court. But these household serfs were not\r\nnearly enough to do all the work upon the monks' land, and far the\r\ngreater part of it had to be done by services paid by the other\r\nlandowners on the estate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _January--Ploughing_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _March--Breaking Clods_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _August--Reaping_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _December--Threshing and Winnowing_]\r\n\r\n1. BODO AT HIS WORK\r\n\r\n[Illustration: II. EMBARKATION OF THE POLOS AT VENICE]\r\n\r\nBeside the seigniorial manse, there were a number of little dependent\r\nmanses. These belonged to men and women who were in various stages of\r\nfreedom, except for the fact that all had to do work on the land of the\r\nchief manse. There is no need to trouble with the different classes, for\r\nin practice there was very little difference between them, and in a\r\ncouple of centuries they were all merged into one common class of\r\nmedieval villeins. The most important people were those called _coloni_,\r\nwho were personally free (that is to say, counted as free men by the\r\nlaw), but bound to the soil, so that they could never leave their farms\r\nand were sold with the estate, if it were sold. Each of the dependent\r\nmanses was held either by one family or by two or three families which\r\nclubbed together to do the work; it consisted of a house or houses, and\r\nfarm buildings, like those of the chief manse, only poorer and made of\r\nwood, with ploughland and a meadow and perhaps a little piece of\r\nvineyard attached to it. In return for these holdings the owner or joint\r\nowners of every manse had to do work on the land of the chief manse for\r\nabout three days in the week. The steward's chief business was to see\r\nthat they did their work properly, and from every one he had the right\r\nto demand two kinds of labour. The first was _field work_: every year\r\neach man was bound to do a fixed amount of ploughing on the domain land\r\n(as it was called later on), and also to give what was called a\r\n_corvée_, that is to say, an unfixed amount of ploughing, which the\r\nsteward could demand every week when it was needed; the distinction\r\ncorresponds to the distinction between _week work_ and _boon work_ in\r\nthe later Middle Ages. The second kind of labour which every owner of a\r\nfarm had to do on the monks' land was called handwork, that is to say,\r\nhe had to help repair buildings, or cut down trees, or gather fruit, or\r\nmake ale, or carry loads--anything, in fact, which wanted doing and\r\nwhich the steward told him to do. It was by these services that the\r\nmonks got their own seigniorial farm cultivated. On all the other days\r\nof the week these hard-worked tenants were free to cultivate their own\r\nlittle farms, and we may be sure that they put twice as much elbow\r\ngrease into the business.\r\n\r\nBut their obligation did not end here, for not only had they to pay\r\nservices, they also had to pay certain rents to the big house. There\r\nwere no State taxes in those days, but every man had to pay an army due,\r\nwhich Charlemagne exacted from the abbey, and which the abbey exacted\r\nfrom its tenants; this took the form of an ox and a certain number of\r\nsheep, or the equivalent in money: 'He pays to the host two shillings of\r\nsilver' comes first on every freeman's list of obligations. The farmers\r\nalso had to pay in return for any special privileges granted to them by\r\nthe monks; they had to carry a load of wood to the big house, in return\r\nfor being allowed to gather firewood in the woods, which were jealously\r\npreserved for the use of the abbey; they had to pay some hogsheads of\r\nwine for the right to pasture their pigs in the same precious woods;\r\nevery third year they had to give up one of their sheep for the right to\r\ngraze upon the fields of the chief manse; they had to pay a sort of\r\npoll-tax of 4_d_. a head. In addition to these special rents every\r\nfarmer had also to pay other rents in produce; every year he owed the\r\nbig house three chickens and fifteen eggs and a large number of planks,\r\nto repair its buildings; often he had to give it a couple of pigs;\r\nsometimes corn, wine, honey, wax, soap, or oil. If the farmer were also\r\nan artisan and made things, he had to pay the produce of his craft; a\r\nsmith would have to make lances for the abbey's contingent to the army,\r\na carpenter had to make barrels and hoops and vine props, a wheelwright\r\nhad to make a cart. Even the wives of the farmers were kept busy, if\r\nthey happened to be serfs; for the servile women were obliged to spin\r\ncloth or to make a garment for the big house every year.\r\n\r\nAll these things were exacted and collected by the steward, whom they\r\ncalled _Villicus_, or _Major_ (Mayor). He was a very hard-worked man,\r\nand when one reads the seventy separate and particular injunctions which\r\nCharlemagne addressed to his stewards one cannot help feeling sorry for\r\nhim. He had to get all the right services out of the tenants, and tell\r\nthem what to do each week and see that they did it; he had to be careful\r\nthat they brought the right number of eggs and pigs up to the house, and\r\ndid not foist off warped or badly planed planks upon him. He had to look\r\nafter the household serfs too, and set them to work. He had to see about\r\nstoring, or selling, or sending off to the monastery the produce of the\r\nestate and of the tenants' rents; and every year he had to present a\r\nfull and detailed account of his stewardship to the abbot. He had a\r\nmanse of his own, with services and rents due from it, and Charlemagne\r\nexhorted his stewards to be prompt in their payments, so as to set a\r\ngood example. Probably his official duties left him very little time to\r\nwork on his own farm, and he would have to put in a man to work it for\r\nhim, as Charlemagne bade his stewards do. Often, however, he had\r\nsubordinate officials called _deans_ under him, and sometimes the work\r\nof receiving and looking after the stores in the big house was done by a\r\nspecial cellarer.\r\n\r\nThat, in a few words, is the way in which the monks of St Germain and\r\nthe other Frankish landowners of the time of Charlemagne managed their\r\nestates. Let us try, now, to look at those estates from a more human\r\npoint of view and see what life was like to a farmer who lived upon\r\nthem. The abbey possessed a little estate called Villaris, near Paris,\r\nin the place now occupied by the park of Saint Cloud. When we turn up\r\nthe pages in the estate book dealing with Villaris, we find that there\r\nwas a man called Bodo living there.[1] He had a wife called Ermentrude\r\nand three children called Wido and Gerbert and Hildegard; and he owned a\r\nlittle farm of arable and meadow land, with a few vines. And we know\r\nvery nearly as much about Bodo's work as we know about that of a\r\nsmallholder in France today. Let us try and imagine a day in his life.\r\nOn a fine spring morning towards the end of Charlemagne's reign Bodo\r\ngets up early, because it is his day to go and work on the monks' farm,\r\nand he does not dare to be late, for fear of the steward. To be sure, he\r\nhas probably given the steward a present of eggs and vegetables the week\r\nbefore, to keep him in a good temper; but the monks will not allow their\r\nstewards to take big bribes (as is sometimes done on other estates), and\r\nBodo knows that he will not be allowed to go late to work. It is his day\r\nto plough, so he takes his big ox with him and little Wido to run by its\r\nside with a goad, and he joins his friends from some of the farms near\r\nby, who are going to work at the big house too. They all assemble, some\r\nwith horses and oxen, some with mattocks and hoes and spades and axes\r\nand scythes, and go off in gangs to work upon the fields and meadows and\r\nwoods of the seigniorial manse, according as the steward orders them.\r\nThe manse next door to Bodo is held by a group of families: Frambert\r\nand Ermoin and Ragenold, with their wives and children. Bodo bids them\r\ngood morning as he passes. Frambert is going to make a fence round the\r\nwood, to prevent the rabbits from coming out and eating the young crops;\r\nErmoin has been told off to cart a great load of firewood up to the\r\nhouse; and Ragenold is mending a hole in the roof of a barn. Bodo goes\r\nwhistling off in the cold with his oxen and his little boy; and it is no\r\nuse to follow him farther, because he ploughs all day and eats his meal\r\nunder a tree with the other ploughmen, and it is very monotonous.\r\n\r\nLet us go back and see what Bodo's wife, Ermentrude, is doing. She is\r\nbusy too; it is the day on which the chicken-rent is due--a fat pullet\r\nand five eggs in all. She leaves her second son, aged nine, to look\r\nafter the baby Hildegard and calls on one of her neighbours, who has to\r\ngo up to the big house too. The neighbour is a serf and she has to take\r\nthe steward a piece of woollen cloth, which will be sent away to St\r\nGermain to make a habit for a monk. Her husband is working all day in\r\nthe lord's vineyards, for on this estate the serfs generally tend the\r\nvines, while the freemen do most of the ploughing. Ermentrude and the\r\nserf's wife go together up to the house. There all is busy. In the men's\r\nworkshop are several clever workmen--a shoemaker, a carpenter, a\r\nblacksmith, and two silversmiths; there are not more, because the best\r\nartisans on the estates of St Germain live by the walls of the abbey, so\r\nthat they can work for the monks on the spot and save the labour of\r\ncarriage. But there were always some craftsmen on every estate, either\r\nattached as serfs to the big house, or living on manses of their own,\r\nand good landowners tried to have as many clever craftsmen as possible.\r\nCharlemagne ordered his stewards each to have in his district 'good\r\nworkmen, namely, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, silversmiths, shoemakers,\r\nturners, carpenters, swordmakers, fishermen, foilers, soapmakers, men\r\nwho know how to make beer, cider, perry, and all other kinds of\r\nbeverages, bakers to make pasty for our table, netmakers who know how to\r\nmake nets for hunting, fishing, and fowling, and others too many to be\r\nnamed'.[2] And some of these workmen are to be found working for the\r\nmonks in the estate of Villaris.\r\n\r\nBut Ermentrude does not stop at the men's workshop. She finds the\r\nsteward, bobs her curtsy to him, and gives up her fowl and eggs, and\r\nthen she hurries off to the women's part of the house, to gossip with\r\nthe serfs there. The Franks used at this time to keep the women of their\r\nhousehold in a separate quarter, where they did the work which was\r\nconsidered suitable for women, very much as the Greeks of antiquity used\r\nto do. If a Frankish noble had lived at the big house, his wife would\r\nhave looked after their work, but as no one lived in the stone house at\r\nVillaris, the steward had to oversee the women. Their quarter consisted\r\nof a little group of houses, with a workroom, the whole surrounded by a\r\nthick hedge with a strong bolted gate, like a harem, so that no one\r\ncould come in without leave. Their workrooms were comfortable places,\r\nwarmed by stoves, and there Ermentrude (who, being a woman, was allowed\r\nto go in) found about a dozen servile women spinning and dyeing cloth\r\nand sewing garments. Every week the harassed steward brought them the\r\nraw materials for their work and took away what they made. Charlemagne\r\ngives his stewards several instructions about the women attached to his\r\nmanses, and we may be sure that the monks of St Germain did the same on\r\ntheir model estates. 'For our women's work,' says Charlemagne, 'they are\r\nto give at the proper time the materials, that is linen, wool, woad,\r\nvermilion, madder, wool combs, teasels, soap, grease, vessels, and other\r\nobjects which are necessary. And let our women's quarters be well looked\r\nafter, furnished with houses and rooms with stoves and cellars, and let\r\nthem be surrounded by a good hedge, and let the doors be strong, so that\r\nthe women can do our work properly.'[3] Ermentrude, however, has to\r\nhurry away after her gossip, and so must we. She goes back to her own\r\nfarm and sets to work in the little vineyard; then after an hour or two\r\ngoes back to get the children's meal and to spend the rest of the day in\r\nweaving warm woollen clothes for them. All her friends are either\r\nworking in the fields on their husbands' farms or else looking after the\r\npoultry, or the vegetables, or sewing at home; for the women have to\r\nwork just as hard as the men on a country farm. In Charlemagne's time\r\n(for instance) they did nearly all the sheep shearing. Then at last Bodo\r\ncomes back for his supper, and as soon as the sun goes down they go to\r\nbed; for their hand-made candle gives only a flicker of light, and they\r\nboth have to be up early in the morning. De Quincey once pointed out,\r\nin his inimitable manner, how the ancients everywhere went to bed, 'like\r\ngood boys, from seven to nine o'clock'. 'Man went to bed early in those\r\nages simply because his worthy mother earth could not afford him\r\ncandles. She, good old lady ... would certainly have shuddered to hear\r\nof any of her nations asking for candles. \"Candles indeed!\" she would\r\nhave said; \"who ever heard of such a thing? and with so much excellent\r\ndaylight running to waste, as I have provided _gratis_! What will the\r\nwretches want next?\"'[4] Something of the same situation prevailed even\r\nin Bodo's time.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is how Bodo and Ermentrude usually passed their working day.\r\nBut, it may be complained, this is all very well. We know about the\r\nestates on which these peasants lived and about the rents which they had\r\nto pay, and the services which they had to do. But how did they feel and\r\nthink and amuse themselves when they were not working? Rents and\r\nservices are only outside things; an estate book only describes routine.\r\nIt would be idle to try to picture the life of a university from a study\r\nof its lecture list, and it is equally idle to try and describe the life\r\nof Bodo from the estate book of his masters. It is no good taking your\r\nmeals in the kitchen if you never talk to the servants. This is true,\r\nand to arrive at Bodo's thoughts and feelings and holiday amusements we\r\nmust bid goodbye to Abbot Irminon's estate book, and peer into some very\r\ndark corners indeed; for though by the aid of Chaucer and Langland and a\r\nfew Court Rolls it is possible to know a great deal about the feelings\r\nof a peasant six centuries later, material is scarce in the ninth\r\ncentury, and it is all the more necessary to remember the secret of the\r\ninvisible ink.\r\n\r\nBodo certainly _had_ plenty of feelings, and very strong ones. When he\r\ngot up in the frost on a cold morning to drive the plough over the\r\nabbot's acres, when his own were calling out for work, he often shivered\r\nand shook the rime from his beard, and wished that the big house and all\r\nits land were at the bottom of the sea (which, as a matter of fact, he\r\nhad never seen and could not imagine). Or else he wished he were the\r\nabbot's huntsman, hunting in the forest; or a monk of St Germain,\r\nsinging sweetly in the abbey church; or a merchant, taking bales of\r\ncloaks and girdles along the high road to Paris; anything, in fact, but\r\na poor ploughman ploughing other people's land. An Anglo-Saxon writer\r\nhas imagined a dialogue with him:\r\n\r\n'Well, ploughman, how do you do your work?' 'Oh, sir, I work very hard.\r\nI go out in the dawning, driving the oxen to the field and I yoke them\r\nto the plough. Be the winter never so stark, I dare not stay at home for\r\nfear of my lord; but every day I must plough a full acre or more, after\r\nhaving yoked the oxen and fastened the share and coulter to the plough!'\r\n'Have you any mate?' 'I have a boy, who drives the oxen with a goad, who\r\nis now hoarse from cold and shouting,' (Poor little Wido!) 'Well, well,\r\nit is very hard work?' 'Yes, indeed it is very hard work.'[5]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, hard as the work was, Bodo sang lustily to cheer himself\r\nand Wido; for is it not related that once, when a clerk was singing the\r\n'Allelulia' in the emperor's presence, Charles turned to one of the\r\nbishops, saying, 'My clerk is singing very well,' whereat the rude\r\nbishop replied, 'Any clown in our countryside drones as well as that to\r\nhis oxen at their ploughing'?[6] It is certain too that Bodo agreed with\r\nthe names which the great Charles gave to the months of the year in his\r\nown Frankish tongue; for he called January 'Winter-month', February\r\n'Mud-month', March 'Spring-month', April 'Easter-month', May\r\n'Joy-month', June 'Plough-month', July 'Hay-month', August\r\n'Harvest-month', September 'Wind-month', October 'Vintage-month',\r\nNovember 'Autumn-month', and December 'Holy-month'.[7]\r\n\r\nAnd Bodo was a superstitious creature. The Franks had been Christian now\r\nfor many years, but Christian though they were, the peasants clung to\r\nold beliefs and superstitions. On the estates of the holy monks of St\r\nGermain you would have found the country people saying charms which were\r\nhoary with age, parts of the lay sung by the Frankish ploughman over his\r\nbewitched land long before he marched southwards into the Roman Empire,\r\nor parts of the spell which the bee-master performed when he swarmed his\r\nbees on the shores of the Baltic Sea. Christianity has coloured these\r\ncharms, but it has not effaced their heathen origin; and because the\r\ntilling of the soil is the oldest and most unchanging of human\r\noccupations, old beliefs and superstitions cling to it and the old gods\r\nstalk up and down the brown furrows, when they have long vanished from\r\nhouses and roads. So on Abbot Irminon's estates the peasant-farmers\r\nmuttered charms over their sick cattle (and over their sick children\r\ntoo) and said incantations over the fields to make them fertile. If you\r\nhad followed behind Bodo when he broke his first furrow you would have\r\nprobably seen him take out of his jerkin a little cake, baked for him by\r\nErmentrude out of different kinds of meal, and you would have seen him\r\nstoop and lay it under the furrow and sing:\r\n\r\nEarth, Earth, Earth! O Earth, our mother!\r\nMay the All-Wielder, Ever-Lord grant thee\r\nAcres a-waxing, upwards a-growing,\r\nPregnant with corn and plenteous in strength;\r\nHosts of grain shafts and of glittering plants!\r\nOf broad barley the blossoms,\r\nAnd of white wheat ears waxing,\r\nOf the whole land the harvest....\r\n\r\nAcre, full-fed, bring forth fodder for men!\r\nBlossoming brightly, blessed become!\r\nAnd the God who wrought with earth grant us gift of growing\r\nThat each of all the corns may come unto our need.[8]\r\n\r\nThen he would drive his plough through the acre.\r\n\r\nThe Church wisely did not interfere with these old rites. It taught Bodo\r\nto pray to the Ever-Lord instead of to Father Heaven, and to the Virgin\r\nMary instead of to Mother Earth, and with these changes let the old\r\nspell he had learned from his ancestors serve him still. It taught him,\r\nfor instance, to call on Christ and Mary in his charm for bees. When\r\nErmentrude heard her bees swarming, she stood outside her cottage and\r\nsaid this little charm over them:\r\n\r\nChrist, there is a swarm of bees outside,\r\nFly hither, my little cattle,\r\nIn blest peace, in God's protection,\r\nCome home safe and sound.\r\nSit down, sit down, bee,\r\nSt Mary commanded thee.\r\n\r\nThou shalt not have leave,\r\nThou shalt not fly to the wood.\r\nThou shalt not escape me,\r\nNor go away from me.\r\nSit very still,\r\nWait God's will![9]\r\n\r\nAnd if Bodo on his way home saw one of his bees caught in a brier bush,\r\nhe immediately stood still and wished--as some people wish today when\r\nthey go under a ladder. It was the Church, too, which taught Bodo to add\r\n'So be it, Lord', to the end of his charm against pain. Now, his\r\nancestors for generations behind him had believed that if you had a\r\nstitch in your side, or a bad pain anywhere, it came from a worm in the\r\nmarrow of your bones, which was eating you up, and that the only way to\r\nget rid of that worm was to put a knife, or an arrow-head, or some other\r\npiece of metal to the sore place, and then wheedle the worm out on to\r\nthe blade by saying a charm. And this was the charm which Bodo's heathen\r\nancestors had always said and which Bodo went on saying when little Wido\r\nhad a pain: 'Come out, worm, with nine little worms, out from the marrow\r\ninto the bone, from the bone into the flesh, from the flesh into the\r\nskin, from the skin into this arrow.' And then (in obedience to the\r\nChurch) he added 'So be it, Lord'.[10] But sometimes it was not possible\r\nto read a Christian meaning into Bodo's doings. Sometimes he paid visits\r\nto some man who was thought to have a wizard's powers, or\r\nsuperstitiously reverenced some twisted tree, about which there hung old\r\nstories never quite forgotten. Then the Church was stern. When he went\r\nto confession the priest would ask him: 'Have you consulted magicians\r\nand enchanters, have you made vows to trees and fountains, have you\r\ndrunk any magic philtre?'[11] And he would have to confess what he did\r\nlast time his cow was sick. But the Church was kind as well as stern.\r\n'When serfs come to you,' we find one bishop telling his priests, 'you\r\nmust not give them as many fasts to perform as rich men. Put upon them\r\nonly half the penance.'[12] The Church knew well enough that Bodo could\r\nnot drive his plough all day upon an empty stomach. The hunting,\r\ndrinking, feasting Frankish nobles could afford to lose a meal.\r\n\r\nIt was from this stern and yet kind Church that Bodo got his holidays.\r\nFor the Church made the pious emperor decree that on Sundays and saints'\r\ndays no servile or other works should be done. Charlemagne's son\r\nrepeated his decree in 827. It runs thus:\r\n\r\n     We ordain according to the law of God and to the command of\r\n     our father of blessed memory in his edicts, that no servile\r\n     works shall be done on Sundays, neither shall men perform\r\n     their rustic labours, tending vines, ploughing fields,\r\n     reaping corn and mowing hay, setting up hedges or fencing\r\n     woods, cutting trees, or working in quarries or building\r\n     houses; nor shall they work in the garden, nor come to the\r\n     law courts, nor follow the chase. But three carrying-services\r\n     it is lawful to do on Sunday, to wit carrying for the army,\r\n     carrying food, or carrying (if need be) the body of a lord to\r\n     its grave. Item, women shall not do their textile works, nor\r\n     cut out clothes, nor stitch them together with the needle,\r\n     nor card wool, nor beat hemp, nor wash clothes in public, nor\r\n     shear sheep: so that there may be rest on the Lord's day. But\r\n     let them come together from all sides to Mass in the Church\r\n     and praise God for all the good things He did for us on that\r\n     day![13]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, Bodo and Ermentrude and their friends were not\r\ncontent to go quietly to church on saints' days and quietly home again.\r\nThey used to spend their holidays in dancing and singing and buffoonery,\r\nas country folk have always done until our own gloomier, more\r\nself-conscious age. They were very merry and not at all refined, and the\r\nplace they always chose for their dances was the churchyard; and\r\nunluckily the songs they sang as they danced in a ring were old pagan\r\nsongs of their forefathers, left over from old Mayday festivities, which\r\nthey could not forget, or ribald love-songs which the Church disliked.\r\nOver and over again we find the Church councils complaining that the\r\npeasants (and sometimes the priests too) were singing 'wicked songs with\r\na chorus of dancing women,' or holding 'ballads and dancings and evil\r\nand wanton songs and such-like lures of the devil';[14] over and over\r\nagain the bishops forbade these songs and dances; but in vain. In every\r\ncountry in Europe, right through the Middle Ages to the time of the\r\nReformation, and after it, country folk continued to sing and dance in\r\nthe churchyard. Two hundred years after Charlemagne's death there grew\r\nup the legend of the dancers of Kölbigk, who danced on Christmas Eve in\r\nthe churchyard, in spite of the warning of the priest, and all got\r\nrooted to the spot for a year, till the Archbishop of Cologne released\r\nthem. Some men say that they were not rooted standing to the spot, but\r\nthat they had to go on dancing for the whole year; and that before they\r\nwere released they had danced themselves waist-deep into the ground.\r\nPeople used to repeat the little Latin verse which they were singing:\r\n\r\n  Equitabat Bovo per silvam frondosam\r\n  Ducebat sibi Merswindem formosam.\r\n  Quid stamus? Cur non imus?[15]\r\n\r\nThrough the leafy forest, Bovo went a-riding\r\nAnd his pretty Merswind trotted on beside him--\r\nWhy are we standing still? Why can't we go away?\r\n\r\nAnother later story still is told about a priest in Worcestershire who\r\nwas kept awake all night by the people dancing in his churchyard and\r\nsinging a song with the refrain 'Sweetheart have pity', so that he could\r\nnot get it out of his head, and the next morning at Mass, instead of\r\nsaying 'Dominus vobiscum', he said 'Sweetheart have pity', and there was\r\na dreadful scandal which got into a chronicle.[16]\r\n\r\nSometimes our Bodo did not dance himself, but listened to the songs of\r\nwandering minstrels. The priests did not at all approve of these\r\nminstrels, who (they said) would certainly go to hell for singing\r\nprofane secular songs, all about the great deeds of heathen heroes of\r\nthe Frankish race, instead of Christian hymns. But Bodo loved them, and\r\nso did Bodo's betters; the Church councils had sometimes even to rebuke\r\nabbots and abbesses for listening to their songs. And the worst of it\r\nwas that the great emperor himself, the good Charlemagne, loved them\r\ntoo. He would always listen to a minstrel, and his biographer, Einhard,\r\ntells us that 'He wrote out the barbarous and ancient songs, in which\r\nthe acts of the kings and their wars were sung, and committed them to\r\nmemory';[17] and one at least of those old sagas, which he liked men to\r\nwrite down, has been preserved on the cover of a Latin manuscript, where\r\na monk scribbled it in his spare time. His son, Louis the Pious, was\r\nvery different; he rejected the national poems, which he had learnt in\r\nhis youth, and would not have them read or recited or taught; he would\r\nnot allow minstrels to have justice in the law courts, and he forbade\r\nidle dances and songs and tales in public places on Sundays; but then he\r\nalso dragged down his father's kingdom into disgrace and ruin. The\r\nminstrels repaid Charlemagne for his kindness to them. They gave him\r\neverlasting fame; for all through the Middle Ages the legend of\r\nCharlemagne grew, and he shares with our King Arthur the honour of being\r\nthe hero of one of the greatest romance-cycles of the Middle Ages. Every\r\ndifferent century clad him anew in its own dress and sang new lays about\r\nhim. What the monkish chroniclers in their cells could never do for\r\nCharlemagne, these despised and accursed minstrels did for him: they\r\ngave him what is perhaps more desirable and more lasting than a place in\r\nhistory-they gave him a place in legend. It is not every emperor who\r\nrules in those realms of gold of which Keats spoke, as well as in the\r\nkingdoms of the world; and in the realms of gold Charlemagne reigns with\r\nKing Arthur, and his peers joust with the Knights of the Round Table.\r\nBodo, at any rate, benefited by Charles's love of minstrels, and it is\r\nprobable that he heard in the lifetime of the emperor himself the first\r\nbeginnings of those legends which afterwards clung to the name of\r\nCharlemagne. One can imagine him round-eyed in the churchyard, listening\r\nto fabulous stories of Charles's Iron March to Pavia, such as a\r\ngossiping old monk of St Gall afterwards wrote down in his\r\nchronicle.[18]\r\n\r\nIt is likely enough that such legends were the nearest Bodo ever came to\r\nseeing the emperor, of whom even the poor serfs who never followed him\r\nto court or camp were proud. But Charles was a great traveller: like all\r\nthe monarchs of the early Middle Ages he spent the time, when he was not\r\nwarring, in trekking round his kingdom, staying at one of his estates,\r\nuntil he and his household had literally eaten their way through it, and\r\nthen passing on to another. And sometimes he varied the procedure by\r\npaying a visit to the estates of his bishops or nobles, who entertained\r\nhim royally. It may be that one day he came on a visit to Bodo's masters\r\nand stopped at the big house on his way to Paris, and then Bodo saw him\r\nplain; for Charlemagne would come riding along the road in his jerkin of\r\notter skin, and his plain blue cloak (Einhard tells us that he hated\r\ngrand clothes and on ordinary days dressed like the common people);[19]\r\nand after him would come his three sons and his bodyguard, and then his\r\nfive daughters. Einhard has also told us that:\r\n\r\n     He had such care of the upbringing of his sons and daughters\r\n     that he never dined without them when he was at home and\r\n     never travelled without them. His sons rode along with him\r\n     and his daughters followed in the rear. Some of his guards,\r\n     chosen for this very purpose, watched the end of the line of\r\n     march where his daughters travelled. They were very beautiful\r\n     and much beloved by their father, and, therefore, it is\r\n     strange that he would give them in marriage to no one, either\r\n     among his own people or of a foreign state. But up to his\r\n     death he kept them all at home saying he could not forgo\r\n     their society.[20]\r\n\r\nThen, with luck, Bodo, quaking at the knees, might even behold a portent\r\nnew to his experience, the emperor's elephant. Haroun El Raschid, the\r\ngreat Sultan of the 'Arabian Nights' had sent it to Charles, and it\r\naccompanied him on all his progresses. Its name was 'Abu-Lubabah', which\r\nis an Arabic word and means 'the father of intelligence[A]', and it died\r\na hero's death on an expedition against the Danes in 810.[21] It is\r\ncertain that ever afterwards Ermentrude quelled little Gerbert, when he\r\nwas naughty, with the threat, 'Abu-Lubabah will come with his long nose\r\nand carry you off.' But Wido, being aged eight and a bread-winner,\r\nprofessed to have felt no fear on being confronted with the elephant;\r\nbut admitted when pressed, that he greatly preferred Haroun El Raschid's\r\nother present to the emperor, the friendly dog, who answered to the name\r\nof 'Becerillo'.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: _Abu-Lubabah_.--It is remarkable that the name should have\r\nsuffered no corruption in the chronicles.]\r\n\r\nIt would be a busy time for Bodo when all these great folk came, for\r\neverything would have to be cleaned before their arrival, the pastry\r\ncooks and sausage-makers summoned and a great feast prepared; and though\r\nthe household serfs did most of the work, it is probable that he had to\r\nhelp. The gossipy old monk of St Gall has given us some amusing pictures\r\nof the excitement when Charles suddenly paid a visit to his subjects:\r\n\r\n     There was a certain bishopric which lay full in Charles's\r\n     path when he journeyed, and which indeed he could hardly\r\n     avoid: and the bishop of this place, always anxious to give\r\n     satisfaction, put everything that he had at Charles's\r\n     disposal. But once the Emperor came quite unexpectedly and\r\n     the bishop in great anxiety had to fly hither and thither\r\n     like a swallow, and had not only the palaces and houses but\r\n     also the courts and squares swept and cleaned: and then,\r\n     tired and irritated, came to meet him. The most pious Charles\r\n     noticed this, and after examining all the various details, he\r\n     said to the bishop: 'My kind host, you always have everything\r\n     splendidly cleaned for my arrival.' Then the bishop, as if\r\n     divinely inspired, bowed his head and grasped the king's\r\n     never-conquered right hand, and hiding his irritation, kissed\r\n     it and said: 'It is but right, my lord, that, wherever you\r\n     come, all things should be thoroughly cleansed.' Then\r\n     Charles, of all kings the wisest, understanding the state of\r\n     affairs said to him: 'If I empty I can also fill.' And he\r\n     added: 'You may have that estate which lies close to your\r\n     bishopric, and all your successors may have it until the end\r\n     of time.' In the same journey, too, he came to a bishop who\r\n     lived in a place through which he must needs pass. Now on\r\n     that day, being the sixth day of the week, he was not willing\r\n     to eat the flesh of beast or bird; and the bishop, being by\r\n     reason of the nature of the place unable to procure fish upon\r\n     the sudden, ordered some excellent cheese, rich and creamy,\r\n     to be placed before him. And the most self-restrained\r\n     Charles, with the readiness which he showed everywhere and on\r\n     all occasions, spared the blushes of the bishop and required\r\n     no better fare; but taking up his knife cut off the skin,\r\n     which he thought unsavoury and fell to on the white of the\r\n     cheese. Thereupon the bishop, who was standing near like a\r\n     servant, drew closer and said: 'Why do you do that, lord\r\n     emperor? You are throwing away the very best part.' Then\r\n     Charles, who deceived no one, and did not believe that anyone\r\n     would deceive him, on the persuasion of the bishop put a\r\n     piece of the skin in his mouth, and slowly ate it and\r\n     swallowed it like butter. Then approving of the advice of the\r\n     bishop, he said: 'Very true, my good host,' and he added: 'Be\r\n     sure to send me every year to Aix two cartloads of just such\r\n     cheeses.' And the bishop was alarmed at the impossibility of\r\n     the task and, fearful of losing both his rank and his office,\r\n     he rejoined: 'My lord, I can procure the cheeses, but I\r\n     cannot tell which are of this quality and which of another.\r\n     Much I fear lest I fall under your censure.' Then Charles,\r\n     from whose penetration and skill nothing could escape,\r\n     however new or strange it might be, spoke thus to the bishop,\r\n     who from childhood had known such cheeses and yet could not\r\n     test them: 'Cut them in two,' he said, 'then fasten together\r\n     with a skewer those that you find to be of the right quality\r\n     and keep them in your cellar for a time and then send them to\r\n     me. The rest you may keep for yourself and your ¸clergy and\r\n     your family.' This was done for two years, and the king\r\n     ordered the present of cheeses to be taken in without remark:\r\n     then in the third year the bishop brought in person his\r\n     laboriously collected cheeses. But the most just Charles\r\n     pitied his labour and anxiety and added to the bishopric an\r\n     excellent estate whence he and his successors might provide\r\n     themselves with corn and wine.[22]\r\n\r\nWe may feel sorry for the poor flustered bishop collecting his two\r\ncartloads of cheeses; but it is possible that our real sympathy ought to\r\ngo to Bodo, who probably had to pay an extra rent in cheeses to satisfy\r\nthe emperor's taste, and got no excellent estate to recompense him.\r\n\r\nA visit from the emperor, however, would be a rare event in his life, to\r\nbe talked about for years and told to his grandchildren. But there was\r\none other event, which happened annually, and which was certainly looked\r\nfor with excitement by Bodo and his friends. For once a year the king's\r\nitinerant justices, the _Missi Dominici_, came round to hold their court\r\nand to see if the local counts had been doing justice. Two of them would\r\ncome, a bishop and a count, and they would perhaps stay a night at the\r\nbig house as guests of the abbot, and the next day they would go on to\r\nParis, and there they would sit and do justice in the open square before\r\nthe church and from all the district round great men and small, nobles\r\nand freemen and _coloni_, would bring their grievances and demand\r\nredress. Bodo would go too, if anyone had injured or robbed him, and\r\nwould make his complaint to the judges. But if he were canny he would\r\nnot go to them empty-handed, trusting to justice alone. Charlemagne was\r\nvery strict, but unless the _missi_ were exceptionally honest and pious\r\nthey would not be averse to taking bribes. Theodulf, Bishop of Orleans,\r\nwho was one of the Emperor's _missi_, has left us a most entertaining\r\nLatin poem, in which he describes the attempts of the clergy and laymen,\r\nwho flocked to his court, to buy justice.[23] Every one according to his\r\nmeans brought a present; the rich offered money, precious stones, fine\r\nmaterials, and Eastern carpets, arms, horses, antique vases of gold or\r\nsilver chiselled with representations of the labours of Hercules. The\r\npoor brought skins of Cordova leather, tanned and untanned, excellent\r\npieces of cloth and linen (poor Ermentrude must have worked hard for\r\nthe month before the justices came!), boxes, and wax. 'With this\r\nbattering-ram,' cries the shocked Bishop Theodulf, 'they hope to break\r\ndown the wall of my soul. But they would not have thought that they\r\ncould shake _me_, if they had not so shaken other judges before,' And\r\nindeed, if his picture be true, the royal justices must have been\r\nfollowed about by a regular caravan of carts and horses to carry their\r\npresents. Even Theodulf has to admit that, in order not to hurt people's\r\nfeelings, he was obliged to accept certain unconsidered trifles in the\r\nshape of eggs and bread and wine and chickens and little birds, 'whose\r\nbodies' (he says, smacking his lips) 'are small, but very good to eat.'\r\nOne seems to detect the anxious face of Bodo behind those eggs and\r\nlittle birds.\r\n\r\nAnother treat Bodo had which happened once a year; for regularly on the\r\nninth of October there began the great fair of St Denys, which went on\r\nfor a whole month, outside the gates of Paris.[24] Then for a week\r\nbefore the fair little booths and sheds sprang up, with open fronts in\r\nwhich the merchants could display their wares, and the Abbey of St\r\nDenys, which had the right to take a toll of all the merchants who came\r\nthere to sell, saw to it that the fair was well enclosed with fences,\r\nand that all came in by the gates and paid their money, for wily\r\nmerchants were sometimes known to burrow under fences or climb over them\r\nso as to avoid the toll. Then the streets of Paris were crowded with\r\nmerchants bringing their goods, packed in carts and upon horses and\r\noxen; and on the opening day all regular trade in Paris stopped for a\r\nmonth, and every Parisian shopkeeper was in a booth somewhere in the\r\nfair, exchanging the corn and wine and honey of the district for rarer\r\ngoods from foreign parts. Bodo's abbey probably had a stall in the fair\r\nand sold some of those pieces of cloth woven by the serfs in the women's\r\nquarter, or cheeses and salted meat prepared on the estates, or wine\r\npaid in rent by Bodo and his fellow-farmers. Bodo would certainly take a\r\nholiday and go to the fair. In fact, the steward would probably have\r\ngreat difficulty in keeping his men at work during the month;\r\nCharlemagne had to give a special order to his stewards that they should\r\n'be careful that our men do properly the work which it is lawful to\r\nexact from them, and that they do not waste their time in running about\r\nto markets and fairs'. Bodo and Ermentrude and the three children, all\r\nattired in their best, did not consider it waste of time to go to the\r\nfair even twice or three times. They pretended that they wanted to buy\r\nsalt to salt down their winter meat, or some vermilion dye to colour a\r\nfrock for the baby. What they really wanted was to wander along the\r\nlittle rows of booths and look at all the strange things assembled\r\nthere; for merchants came to St Denys to sell their rich goods from the\r\ndistant East to Bodo's betters, and wealthy Frankish nobles bargained\r\nthere for purple and silken robes with orange borders, stamped leather\r\njerkins, peacock's feathers, and the scarlet plumage of flamingos (which\r\nthey called 'phoenix skins'), scents and pearls and spices, almonds and\r\nraisins, and monkeys for their wives to play with.[25] Sometimes these\r\nmerchants were Venetians, but more often they were Syrians or crafty\r\nJews, and Bodo and his fellows laughed loudly over the story of how a\r\nJewish merchant had tricked a certain bishop, who craved for all the\r\nlatest novelties, by stuffing a mouse with spices and offering it for\r\nsale to him, saying that 'he had brought this most precious\r\nnever-before-seen animal from Judea,' and refusing to take less than a\r\nwhole measure of silver for it.[26] In exchange for their luxuries these\r\nmerchants took away with them Frisian cloth, which was greatly esteemed,\r\nand corn and hunting dogs, and sometimes a piece of fine goldsmith's\r\nwork, made in a monastic workshop. And Bodo would hear a hundred\r\ndialects and tongues, for men of Saxony and Frisia, Spain and Provence,\r\nRouen and Lombardy, and perhaps an Englishman or two, jostled each other\r\nin the little streets; and from time to time there came also an Irish\r\nscholar with a manuscript to sell, and the strange, sweet songs of\r\nIreland on his lips:\r\n\r\nA hedge of trees surrounds me,\r\nA blackbird's lay sings to me;\r\nAbove my lined booklet\r\nThe thrilling birds chant to me.\r\n\r\nIn a grey mantle from the top of bushes\r\nThe cuckoo sings:\r\nVerily--may the Lord shield me!--\r\nWell do I write under the greenwood.[27]\r\n\r\nThen there were always jugglers and tumblers, and men with performing\r\nbears, and minstrels to wheedle Bodo's few pence out of his pocket. And\r\nit would be a very tired and happy family that trundled home in the cart\r\nto bed. For it is not, after all, so dull in the kitchen, and when we\r\nhave quite finished with the emperor, 'Charlemagne and all his peerage',\r\nit is really worth while to spend a few moments with Bodo in his little\r\nmanse. History is largely made up of Bodos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_Marco Polo_\r\n\r\nA VENETIAN TRAVELLER OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nEt por ce, veul ie que un et autre sachent a tos iors mais les euvres\r\ndes Veneciens, et qui il furent, et dont il vindrent, et qui il sont, et\r\ncomment il firent la noble Cite que l'en apele Venise, qui est orendroit\r\nla plus bele dou siecle....

And if anyone should\r\ndesire to tell of all the vastness and great marvels of this city, a\r\ngood quire of paper would not hold the matter, I trow. For 'tis the\r\ngreatest and noblest city, and the finest for merchandise, that the\r\nwhole world containeth.\r\n\r\n          --ODORIC OF PORDENONE\r\n\r\nLet us go back in mind--as would that we could go back in body--to the\r\nyear 1268. It is a year which makes no great stir in the history books,\r\nbut it will serve us well. In those days, as in our own, Venice lay upon\r\nher lagoons, a city (as Cassiodurus long ago saw her[B]) like a\r\nsea-bird's nest afloat on the shallow waves, a city like a ship, moored\r\nto the land but only at home upon the seas, the proudest city in all the\r\nWestern world. For only consider her position. Lying at the head of the\r\nAdriatic, half-way between East and West, on the one great sea\r\nthoroughfare of medieval commerce, a Mediterranean seaport, yet set so\r\nfar north that she was almost in the heart of Europe, Venice gathered\r\ninto her harbour all the trade routes overland and overseas, on which\r\npack-horses could travel or ships sail. Merchants bringing silk and\r\nspices, camphor and ivory, pearls and scents and carpets from the Levant\r\nand from the hot lands beyond it, all came to port in Venice. For\r\nwhether they came by way of Egypt sailing between the low banks of the\r\nNile and jolting on camels to Alexandria, or whether they came through\r\nthe rich and pleasant land of Persia and the Syrian desert to Antioch\r\nand Tyre, or whether they slowly pushed their way in a long, thin\r\ncaravan across the highlands of Central Asia, and south of the Caspian\r\nSea to Trebizond, and so sailed through the Black Sea and the\r\nDardanelles, Venice was their natural focus. Only Constantinople might\r\nhave rivalled her, and Constantinople she conquered. To Venice,\r\ntherefore, as if drawn by a magnet, came the spoils of the East, and\r\nfrom Venice they went by horse across the Alps by the Brenner and St\r\nGothard passes to Germany and France, or in galleys by way of the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar to England and Flanders;[1] and the galleys and\r\npack-horses came back again to Venice, laden with the metals of Germany,\r\nthe furs of Scandinavia, the fine wools of England, the cloth of\r\nFlanders, and the wine of France.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: 'Hic vobis, aquatilium avium more, domus est.']\r\n\r\nBut if geography gave Venice an unrivalled site, the Venetians did the\r\nrest. Through all the early years of their history they defied\r\nConstantinople to the east of them, and Pope and Holy Roman Emperor to\r\nthe west; sometimes turning to one, sometimes to the other, but\r\nstubbornly bent all the while upon independence, replying, when invited\r\nto become subjects: 'God, Who is our help and protector has saved us to\r\ndwell upon these waters. This Venice, which we have raised in the\r\nlagoons, is our mighty habitation, no power of emperor or of prince can\r\ntouch us'; apt, if threatened, to retire to their islands and derisively\r\nto fire cannon balls of bread into the mainland force, which sought to\r\nstarve them out.[2] Always they were conscious that their future lay\r\nupon the waters, and in that East, whose colour had crept into their\r\ncivilization and warmed their blood. They were eastern and western both,\r\nthe Venetians, hot hearts for loving and conquering, icy heads for\r\nscheming and ruling. Bit by bit they secured the ring of mainland behind\r\nthem, all the while keeping at bay the Saracen and Slav sea rovers,\r\nwhose ships were the terror of the Mediterranean. Then they descended\r\nupon the pirates of Dalmatia, who thus harassed their trading vessels,\r\nand took all the Dalmatian coast. The Doge of Venice became Duke of\r\nDalmatia. 'True it is,' says their chronicles, 'that the Adriatic Sea is\r\nin the duchy of Venice,'[3] and they called it the 'Gulf of Venice'. Now\r\nit was that there was first instituted the magnificent symbolical\r\nceremony of wedding the sea, with the proud words 'Desponsamus te mare\r\nin signum veri perpetuique domini'![4]\r\n\r\nShe was a maiden city, bright and free,\r\nNo guile seduced, no force could violate,\r\nAnd when she took unto herself a mate\r\nShe must espouse the everlasting sea.\r\n\r\nAnd truly it seemed as though the very sea had sworn to honour and obey\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThen came the Crusades, when Europe forgot its differences and threw\r\nitself upon the paynim who held the holy places of its faith, when men\r\nfrom all lands marched behind the banner of the Cross and the towers of\r\nJerusalem were more real than the Tower of Babel. Now, at last, Venice\r\nsaw her dream within her hand. It was Venice who provided galleys and\r\nVenice who provided convoys and commissariat and soldiers, at a good\r\nround sum; and when time came for the division of the spoil, Venice\r\ndemanded in every captured town of Palestine and Syria a church, a\r\ncounting-house and the right to trade without tolls. Her great chance\r\ncame in the Fourth Crusade, when her old blind Doge Enrico Dandolo\r\n(whose blindness had the Nelson touch) upon the pretext that the\r\nCrusaders could not pay the transport fees agreed upon, turned the whole\r\nCrusade to the use of Venice, and conquered first Zara, which had dared\r\nto revolt from her, and then her ancient--her only--rival, the immortal\r\nByzantium itself. It is true that the Pope excommunicated the Venetians\r\nwhen they first turned the armies against Zara, but what matter? They\r\nlooted Constantinople and brought back the four great gilded horses to\r\nSt Mark's--St Mark's, which has been compared to a robbers' cave crowded\r\nwith the booty of the Levant, and which held the sacred body of the\r\nsaint, stolen from Alexandria by the Venetians, nearly four centuries\r\nbefore, concealed in a tub of pickled pork, in order to elude the\r\nMoslems. A Venetian patriarch now said Mass in St Sophia. Venice\r\nreceived the proud title of 'Ruler of a half and a quarter of the Roman\r\nEmpire,' ('quartæ partis et dimidiæ totius imperii Romaniæ'--the words\r\nhave a ring of trumpets), and the Doge, buskined in scarlet like the\r\nancient Roman emperors, now ruled supreme over four seas--the Adriatic,\r\nthe Aegean, the Sea of Marmora, and the Black Sea. Venetian factories\r\nstudded all the Levantine coasts, in Tripoli and Tyre, Salonica,\r\nAdrianople, and Constantinople, in Trebizond on the Black Sea, even at\r\nCaffa in the far Crimea, whence ran the mysterious road into Russia.\r\nCrete and Rhodes and Cyprus were hers; her galleys swept the pirates\r\nfrom the seas and brooked no rivals; all trade with the East must pass\r\nthrough Venice, and Venice only. The other trading cities of Italy\r\nstruggled against her, and Genoa came near to rivalling her, but in\r\n1258, and again in 1284, she utterly defeated the Genoese fleet. Not for\r\nthe city of 'sea without fish, mountains without woods, men without\r\nfaith, and women without shame' was it to bit the horses on St\r\nMark's.[5] In 1268 Venice seemed supreme. Byzantium was her washpot and\r\nover the Levant she had cast her shoe. Truly her chronicler might\r\nwrite of her:\r\n\r\nDalmatia, Albania, Rumania, Greece, Trebizond, Syria, Armenia, Egypt,\r\nCyprus, Candia, Apulia, Sicily, and other countries, kingdoms and\r\nislands were the fruitful gardens, the proud castles of our people,\r\nwhere they found again pleasure, profit, and security.... The Venetians\r\nwent about the sea, here and there and across the sea, and in all places\r\nwheresoever water runs, and bought merchandise and brought it to Venice\r\nfrom every side. Then there came to Venice Germans and Bavarians, French\r\nand Lombards, Tuscans and Hungarians, and every people that lives by\r\nmerchandise and they took it to their countries.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that (as a later traveller observed) the Venetians were\r\nproud of their great rule, and when a son was born to a Venetian were\r\nwont to say among themselves, 'A Signor is born into the world.'\r\n\r\nIs it not true to say that Venice was the proudest city on earth, _la\r\nnoble cite que l'en apele Venise, qui est orendroit la plus bele dou\r\nsiecle_?[6] Life was a fair and splendid thing for those merchant\r\nprinces, who held the gorgeous East in fee in the year of grace 1268. In\r\nthat year traders in great stone counting-houses, lapped by the waters\r\nof the canals, were checking, book in hand, their sacks of cloves, mace\r\nand nutmegs, cinnamon and ginger from the Indies, ebony chessmen from\r\nIndo China, ambergris from Madagascar, and musk from Tibet. In that year\r\nthe dealers in jewels were setting prices upon diamonds from Golconda,\r\nrubies and lapis lazuli from Badakhshan, and pearls from the fisheries\r\nof Ceylon; and the silk merchants were stacking up bales of silk and\r\nmuslin and brocade from Bagdad and Yezd and Malabar and China. In that\r\nyear young gallants on the Rialto (scented gallants, but each, like\r\nShakespeare's Antonio, with a ship venturing into port somewhere in the\r\nLevant) rubbed elbows with men of all nations, heard travellers' tales\r\nof all lands, and at dawn slipped along the canals in gondolas (not\r\nblack in those days, but painted and hung with silk), saluting the\r\nmorning with songs; and the red-haired ladies of Venice whom centuries\r\nlater Titian loved to paint, went trailing up and down the marble steps\r\nof their palaces, with all the brocades of Persia on their backs and all\r\nthe perfumes of Arabia to sweeten their little hands.\r\n\r\nIt was in that year, too, that one Martino da Canale, a clerk in the\r\ncustoms house, began to busy himself (like Chaucer after him) less with\r\nhis accounts than with writing in the delectable French language ('por\r\nce que lengue franceise cort parmi le monde, et est la plus delitable a\r\nlire et a oir que nule autre') a chronicle of Venice. It is of the\r\nwater, watery, Canale's chronicle, like Ariel's dirge; he has indeed,\r\n'that intenseness of feeling which seems to resolve itself into the\r\nelements which it contemplates.' Here is nothing indeed, of 'the surge\r\nand thunder of the Odyssey', but the lovely words sparkle like the sun\r\non the waters of the Mediterranean, and like a refrain, singing itself\r\nin and out of the narrative, the phrase recurs, 'Li tens estoit clers et\r\nbiaus ... et lors quant il furent en mer, li mariniers drecerent les\r\nvoiles au vent, et lesserent core a ploine voiles les mes parmi la mer a\r\nla force dou vent';[7] for so much of the history of Venice was enacted\r\nupon deck. It is a passing proud chronicle, too, for Canale was, and\r\nwell he knew it, a citizen of no mean city.\r\n\r\n     'Now would I,' he says, 'that every one and all know for ever\r\n     the works of the Venetians, who they were and whence they\r\n     came and what they are, and how they made the noble city\r\n     which is called Venice, which is this day the fairest in the\r\n     world. And I would that all those who are now living and\r\n     those who are to come know how the noble city is builded and\r\n     how all good things abound in her, and how the sire of the\r\n     Venetians, the noble Doge, is powerful, and what nobility is\r\n     found therein and the prowess of the Venetian people, and how\r\n     they are all perfect in the faith of Jesu Christ and obedient\r\n     to holy Church, and how they never disobey the commandment of\r\n     holy Church. Within this noble Venice there dares to dwell\r\n     neither heretic, nor usurer, murderer, thief nor robber. And\r\n     I will tell you the names of all the Doges that have been in\r\n     Venice, one after the other, and what they did to the honour\r\n     of holy Church and of their noble City. And I will tell you\r\n     the names of the noble captains whom the noble Doges sent in\r\n     their time to lay low their enemies, and concerning the\r\n     victories that they won I will have you know, for it is\r\n     fitting.... In the year of the incarnation of our Lord Jesu\r\n     Christ MCCLXVII years, in the time of Milord Renier Zeno, the\r\n     high Doge of Venice, I laboured and strove until I found the\r\n     ancient history of the Venetians, whence they came first and\r\n     how they builded the noble city called Venice, which is today\r\n     the fairest and the pleasantest in the world, full of beauty\r\n     and of all good things. Merchandise flows through this noble\r\n     city even as water flows from the fountains, and the salt\r\n     water runs through it and round it and in all places save in\r\n     the houses and the streets; and when the citizens go abroad\r\n     they can return to their houses by land or by water, as they\r\n     will. From all parts there come merchandise and merchants,\r\n     who buy merchandise as they will and take it back to their\r\n     own countries. Within this town is found food in great\r\n     plenty, bread and wine, land fowl and river fowl, fresh meat\r\n     and salt, and sea fish and river fish.... You may find within\r\n     this fair town many men of gentle birth, both old men and\r\n     young _damoisaus_ in plenty, and merchants with them, who buy\r\n     and sell, and money changers and citizens of all crafts, and\r\n     therewith mariners of all sorts, and ships to carry them to\r\n     all lands and galleys to lay low their enemies. And in this\r\n     fair town is also great plenty of ladies and damsels and\r\n     maidens, very richly apparelled.'[8]\r\n\r\n     It happened that there was a new Doge that year, our year\r\n     1268, Lorenzo Tiepolo by name, and a great procession of the\r\n     gilds took place before the palace on the Piazza of St Mark\r\n     to welcome his accession. Martino da Canale was watching it\r\n     and wrote it all down in his chronicle. First came the navy\r\n     sailing past in the harbour, fifty galleys and other ships,\r\n     with their crews cheering and shouting on deck. Then came the\r\n     gilds on foot: first the master smiths, with garlands on\r\n     their heads and banners and trumpets; then the furriers\r\n     apparelled in samite and scarlet silk, with mantles of ermine\r\n     and vair; then the weavers richly bedight, and the ten master\r\n     tailors in white with crimson stars. Then the master\r\n     clothworkers passed, carrying boughs of olive and wearing\r\n     crowns of olive on their heads; then the fustian makers in\r\n     furred robes of their own weaving, and the quilt makers with\r\n     garlands of gilt beads and white cloaks sewn with\r\n     fleurs-de-lis, marching two by two, with little children\r\n     singing _chansonettes_ and _cobles_ before them. Then came\r\n     the makers of cloth of gold, all in cloth of gold, and their\r\n     servants in cloth of gold or of purple, followed by the\r\n     mercers in silk and the butchers in scarlet, the fish sellers\r\n     robed and furred and garlanded, and the master barbers,\r\n     having with them two riders attired as knights-errant, and\r\n     four captive damsels, strangely garbed. Then came the\r\n     glass-workers in scarlet furred with vair, and gold-fringed\r\n     hoods, and rich garlands of pearls, carrying flasks and\r\n     goblets of the famous Venetian glass before them, and the\r\n     comb and lantern makers, with a lantern full of birds to let\r\n     loose in the Doge's presence, and the goldsmiths wearing\r\n     wreaths and necklaces of gold and silver beads and sapphires,\r\n     emeralds, diamonds, topazes, jacinths, amethysts, rubies,\r\n     jasper, and carbuncles. Master and servants alike were\r\n     sumptuously clad, and almost all wore gold fringes on their\r\n     hoods, and garlands of gilded beads. Each craft was\r\n     accompanied by its band of divers instruments, and bore with\r\n     it silver cups and flagons of wine, and all marched in fair\r\n     order, singing ballads and songs of greeting, and saluted the\r\n     Doge and Dogaressa in turn, crying 'Long live our lord, the\r\n     noble Doge Lorenzo Tiepolo!' Gild after gild they marched in\r\n     their splendour, lovely alike to ear and eye; and a week fled\r\n     before the rejoicings were ended and all had passed in\r\n     procession. Canale surpasses himself here, for he loved State\r\n     ceremonies; he gives a paragraph to the advance of each gild,\r\n     its salutation and withdrawal, and the cumulative effect of\r\n     all the paragraphs is enchanting, like a prose ballade, with\r\n     a repeated refrain at the end of every verse.[9]\r\n\r\nWhat, they lived once thus in Venice, where the merchants were the\r\n  kings,\r\nWhere St Mark's is, where the Doges used to wed the sea with rings?\r\n\r\n     Listening to the magnificent salutation of the Doge by the\r\n     priests of St Mark's, 'Criste, vince, Criste regne, Criste\r\n     inpere. Notre signor Laurens Teuples, Des gracie, inclit Dus\r\n     de Venise, Dalmace atque Groace, et dominator de la quarte\r\n     partie et demi de tot l'enmire de Romanie, sauvement, honor,\r\n     vie, et victoire. Saint Marc, tu le aie,'[10] who, hearing,\r\n     could have doubted that Venice, defier of Rome and conqueror\r\n     of Constantinople, was the finest, richest, most beautiful,\r\n     and most powerful city in the world?\r\n\r\n     But was she? Listen and judge. Thousands of miles away from\r\n     Venice, across the lands and seas of Asia, a little south of\r\n     the Yangtze River and close to the sea stood the city of\r\n     Kinsai or Hangchow, the capital of the Sung emperors, who\r\n     ruled Southern China, not yet (in 1268) conquered by the\r\n     Tartars.[11] Like Venice, Kinsai stood upon lagoons of water\r\n     and was intersected by innumerable canals. It was a hundred\r\n     miles in circuit, not counting the suburbs which stretched\r\n     round it, and there was not a span of ground which was not\r\n     well peopled. It had twelve great gates, and each of the\r\n     twelve quarters which lay within the gates was greater than\r\n     the whole of Venice. Its main street was two hundred feet\r\n     wide, and ran from end to end of the city, broken every four\r\n     miles by a great square, lined with houses, gardens, palaces,\r\n     and the shops of the artisans, who were ruled by its twelve\r\n     great craft gilds. Parallel with the main street was the\r\n     chief canal, beside which stood the stone warehouses of the\r\n     merchants who traded with India. Twelve thousand stone\r\n     bridges spanned its waterways, and those over the principal\r\n     canals were high enough to allow ships with their tapering\r\n     masts to pass below, while the carts and horses passed\r\n     overhead. In its market-places men chaffered for game and\r\n     peaches, sea-fish, and wine made of rice and spices; and in\r\n     the lower part of the surrounding houses were shops, where\r\n     spices and drugs and silk, pearls and every sort of\r\n     manufactured article were sold. Up and down the streets of\r\n     Kinsai moved lords and merchants clad in silk, and the most\r\n     beautiful ladies in the world swayed languidly past in\r\n     embroidered litters, with jade pins in their black hair and\r\n     jewelled earrings swinging against their smooth cheeks.[12]\r\n\r\n     On one side of this city lay a beautiful lake (famous in\r\n     Chinese history, and still one of the fairest prospects upon\r\n     earth), studded with wooded islands, on which stood pavilions\r\n     with charming names: 'Lake Prospect', 'Bamboo Chambers', 'The\r\n     House of the Eight Genii', and 'Pure Delight'. Here, like the\r\n     Venetians, the men of Kinsai came for pleasure parties in\r\n     barges, nobly hung and furnished, the cabins painted with\r\n     flowers and mountain landscapes, and looking out they saw on\r\n     one side the whole expanse of the city, its palaces, temples,\r\n     convents, and gardens, and on the other the stretch of clear\r\n     water, crowded with coloured pleasure boats, over which came\r\n     echoing the high, clear voices and the tinkling instruments\r\n     of the revellers. There is no space in which to tell of the\r\n     King's palace, with its gardens and orchards, its painted\r\n     pavilions, and the groves where the palace ladies coursed the\r\n     game with dogs, and, tired of the pastime, flung off their\r\n     robes and ran to the lake, where they disported themselves\r\n     like a shoal of silver fishes. But a word must be said of the\r\n     junks, which came sailing into the harbour four and twenty\r\n     miles away, and up the river to the city; and of the great\r\n     concourse of ships which came to Zaiton (perhaps the modern\r\n     Amoy), the port of the province. Here every year came a\r\n     hundred times more pepper than came to the whole of\r\n     Christendom through the Levantine ports. Here from Indo China\r\n     and the Indies came spices and aloes and sandalwood, nutmegs,\r\n     spikenard and ebony, and riches beyond mention. Big junks\r\n     laded these things, together with musk from Tibet, and bales\r\n     of silk from all the cities of Mansi[C], and sailed away in\r\n     and out of the East India Archipelago, with its spice-laden\r\n     breezes billowing their sails, to Ceylon. There merchants\r\n     from Malabar and the great trading cities of southern India\r\n     took aboard their cargoes and sold them in turn to Arab\r\n     merchants, who in their turn sold them to the Venetians in\r\n     one or other of the Levantine ports. Europeans who saw Zaiton\r\n     and the other Chinese seaports in after years were wont to\r\n     say that no one, not even a Venetian, could picture to\r\n     himself the multitude of trading vessels which sailed upon\r\n     those eastern seas and crowded into those Chinese harbours.\r\n     They said also with one accord that Kinsai was without doubt\r\n     the finest and richest and noblest city in the world. To the\r\n     men of Kinsai, Venice would have been a little suburb and the\r\n     Levant a backyard. The whole of the east was their trading\r\n     field, and their wealth and civilization were already old\r\n     when Venice was a handful of mud huts peopled by fishermen.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote C: Mansi or Manji was southern China and Cathay was\r\n     northern China, the boundary between them lying along the\r\n     River Hoang-Ho on the east and the southern boundary of\r\n     Shensi on the west.]\r\n\r\n     Nor was Kinsai alone and unmatched in all its wonder and\r\n     beauty, for a three days' journey from it stood Sugui, which\r\n     today we call Suchow, lying also on the great canal, with its\r\n     circumference of twenty miles, its prodigious multitudes\r\n     swarming the streets, its physicians, philosophers, and\r\n     magicians; Sugui, with the ginger which was so common that\r\n     forty pounds of it might be bought for the price of a\r\n     Venetian silver groat, the silk which was manufactured in\r\n     such vast quantities that all the citizens were dressed in it\r\n     and still ships laden with it sailed away; Sugui under whose\r\n     jurisdiction were sixteen wealthy cities, where trade and the\r\n     arts flourished. If you had not seen Hangchow, you would have\r\n     said that there was no city in the world, not Venice nor\r\n     Constantinople nor another worthy to be named in the same\r\n     breath with Sugui. The Chinese indeed, seeing the riches and\r\n     beauty of these two cities, doubted whether even the pleasant\r\n     courts of heaven could show their equal and proudly quoted\r\n     the proverb:\r\n\r\n_Shang yeu t'ien t'ang,\r\nHia yeu Su Hang_.\r\n\r\n(There's Paradise above, 'tis true,\r\nBut here below we've Hang and Su.)[13]\r\n\r\n     Kinsai seems far enough away in all conscience from Venice in\r\n     the year 1268, and Venice was all unwitting of its existence,\r\n     far beyond the sunrise. Yet there was in the city of the\r\n     lagoons that year, watching the same procession of the gilds\r\n     which Canale watched, a boy who was destined to link them for\r\n     ever in the minds of men--a lean lad of fourteen, Marco Polo\r\n     by name, who was always kicking his heels on the quay and\r\n     bothering foreign sailors for tales of distant lands. He\r\n     heard all they had to tell him very willingly, storing it up\r\n     in that active brain of his, for his curiosity was\r\n     insatiable; but always the tales that he heard most willingly\r\n     were about the Tartars.\r\n\r\n     At this time the Tartars were at the height of their power in\r\n     the West and the East. Tartars ruled at Peking all over\r\n     northern China, Corea, Mongolia, Manchuria, and Tibet, and\r\n     took tribute from Indo-China and Java. Tartars were spread\r\n     over central Asia, holding sway in Turkestan and Afghanistan.\r\n     The Golden Horde ruled the Caucasus, a large part of Russia,\r\n     and a piece of Siberia. Tartars held sway in Persia, Georgia,\r\n     Armenia, and a part of Asia Minor. When the great Mangu Khan\r\n     died in 1259, one empire lay spread across Asia and Europe,\r\n     from the Yellow River to the Danube. There had been nothing\r\n     like it in the world before, and there was nothing like it\r\n     again, until the Russian Empire of modern times. By 1268 it\r\n     was beginning to split up into the four kingdoms of China,\r\n     central Asia, Russia, and Persia, but still it was one\r\n     people. Now, the attitude of the West to the Tartars at this\r\n     time was very interesting. At first it feared them as a new\r\n     scourge of God, like Attila and his Huns; they overran\r\n     Poland, ravaged Hungary, and seemed about to break like a\r\n     great flood upon the West, and overwhelm it utterly. Then the\r\n     tide rolled back. Gradually the West lost its first\r\n     stupefaction and terror and began to look hopefully towards\r\n     the Tartars as a possible ally against its age-old foe, the\r\n     Moslem. The Christians of the West knew that the Tartars had\r\n     laid the Moslem power low through the length and breadth of\r\n     Asia, and they knew too, that the Tartars had no very sharply\r\n     defined faith and were curious of all beliefs that came their\r\n     way. Gradually the West became convinced that the Tartars\r\n     might be converted to Christianity, and fight side by side\r\n     beneath the Cross against the hated Crescent. There grew up\r\n     the strange legend of Prester John, a Christian priest-king,\r\n     ruling somewhere in the heart of Asia; and indeed little\r\n     groups of Nestorian Christians did still survive in eastern\r\n     Asia at this time.[14] Embassies began to pass between Tartar\r\n     khans and western monarchs, and there began also a great\r\n     series of missions of Franciscan friars to Tartary, men who\r\n     were ethnologists and geographers at heart as well as\r\n     missionaries, and have left us priceless accounts of the\r\n     lands which they visited. In the year of grace 1268, much\r\n     was known about central Asia, for in 1245 the Pope had sent\r\n     the Italian friar John of Plano Carpini thither, and in 1251\r\n     another friar, William of Rubruck, a French Fleming, had been\r\n     sent by the saintly Louis, King of France. Both got as far as\r\n     Karakorum, the Tartar camp on the borders of northern China,\r\n     though they did not enter China itself. They had brought back\r\n     innumerable stories about the nomad conquerors, who carried\r\n     their tents on carts, and drank fermented mares' milk, about\r\n     the greatness of the khan and his welcome to the strangers\r\n     from the West, and the interest with which he listened to\r\n     their preaching.[15] These tales were common property now,\r\n     and Marco Polo must have listened to them.\r\n\r\n     Marco Polo was always talking of the Tartars, always asking\r\n     about them. Indeed, he had reason to be interested in them.\r\n     This (as we have said) was the year of grace 1268, and eight\r\n     years before (some, indeed, say fifteen years) his father,\r\n     Nicolo Polo, and his uncle Maffeo had vanished into Tartary.\r\n     They were rich merchants, trading with their own ship to\r\n     Constantinople, and there they had decided to go on a\r\n     commercial venture into the lands of the Golden Horde, which\r\n     lay to the north of the Black Sea. So they had sailed over to\r\n     the Crimea, where they had a counting-house at Soldaia, and\r\n     taking with them a store of costly jewels, for they were\r\n     jewel merchants, they had set off on horseback to visit the\r\n     Khan of the West Tartars. So much the Venetians knew, for\r\n     word had come back from Soldaia of their venture; but they\r\n     had never returned. And so Marco, kicking his heels upon the\r\n     quay, caught sailor-men by the sleeve and asked them about\r\n     those wild horsemen with their mares' milk and their\r\n     magicians and their droves of cattle; and as he asked he\r\n     wondered about his father and his uncle, and whether they\r\n     were dead and lost for ever in the wilds of Tartary. But even\r\n     while he asked and wondered and kicked his heels on the quay,\r\n     while the Doge Tiepolo was watching the procession of the\r\n     gilds and the clerk Canale was adding up customs dues or\r\n     writing the ancient history of the Venetians, at that very\r\n     moment the two Polos were slowly and wearily making their way\r\n     across the heights of central Asia with a caravan of mules\r\n     and camels, drawing near to golden Samarcand with its teeming\r\n     bazaars, coming nearer and nearer to the West; and in the\r\n     following year, 1269, they reached Acre, and took ship there\r\n     for Venice, and so at last came home.\r\n\r\n     They had a strange story to tell, stranger and better than\r\n     anything the lean, inquisitive boy had heard upon the quays.\r\n     They had soon disposed of their jewels and they had spent a\r\n     year at the camp of the Khan of the Golden Horde of Kipchak\r\n     on the mighty River Volga. Then war broke out between that\r\n     ruler and the Khan who ruled the Persian Khanate, and it cut\r\n     off their way back. But Marco's curiosity was inherited; and\r\n     no Venetian was ever averse to seeing strange lands and\r\n     seeking out new opportunities for trade; so the Polos decided\r\n     to go on and visit the Khan of central Asia or Chagatai, and\r\n     perhaps make their way back to Constantinople by some\r\n     unfrequented route. They struggled over plains peopled only\r\n     by tent-dwelling Tartars and their herds, until at last they\r\n     reached the noble city of Bokhara. They must have followed\r\n     the line of the Oxus River, and if we reverse the marvellous\r\n     description which Matthew Arnold wrote of that river's course\r\n     in _Sohrab and Rustum_, we shall have a picture of the\r\n     Polos' journey:\r\n\r\nBut the majestic River floated on,\r\nOut of the mist and hum of that low land,\r\nInto the frosty starlight, and there moved,\r\nRejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian waste\r\nUnder the solitary moon; he flow'd\r\nRight for the Polar Star, past Orgunjè,\r\nBrimming and bright and large: then sands begin\r\nTo hem his watery march, and dam his streams,\r\nAnd split his currents; that for many a league\r\nThe shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along\r\nThrough beds of sand and matted rushy isles--\r\nOxus, forgetting the bright speed he had\r\nIn his high mountain cradle in Pamere,\r\nA foil'd circuitous wanderer:--till at last\r\nThe long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide\r\nHis luminous home of waters opens, bright\r\nAnd tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars\r\nEmerge and shine upon the Aral Sea.\r\n\r\n     For three years the Polos remained at Bokhara, until one day\r\n     it happened that an embassy came to the city, on its way back\r\n     from the khan in Persia to the great Khan Kublai, who ruled\r\n     in far-off China, and to whom all the Tartar rulers owed\r\n     allegiance. The chief ambassador was struck with the talents\r\n     and charm of the brothers, who had now become proficient in\r\n     the Tartar language, and persuaded them to accompany him on\r\n     his journey to the presence of the Great Khan, who had never\r\n     yet set eyes on a man of the West, and would, he assured\r\n     them, receive them honourably. They would not have been\r\n     Venetians had they refused such an opportunity, and, taking\r\n     their Venetian servants with them, they journeyed for a year\r\n     with the Tartar embassy across the heart of Asia, and so\r\n     reached the great Kublai Khan. Many years later Marco himself\r\n     described their reception, as they had told it to him:\r\n\r\n     Being introduced to the presence of the Grand Khan Kublai,\r\n     the travellers were received by him with the condescension\r\n     and affability that belonged to his character, and as they\r\n     were the first Latins who had made their appearance in that\r\n     country, they were entertained with feasts and honoured with\r\n     other marks of distinction. Entering graciously into\r\n     conversations with them, he made earnest inquiries on the\r\n     subject of the western parts of the world, of the Emperor of\r\n     the Romans, and of other Christian kings and princes ... and\r\n     above all he questioned them particularly respecting the\r\n     Pope, the affairs of the Church, and the religious worship\r\n     and doctrine of the Christians. Being well instructed and\r\n     discreet men, they gave appropriate answers upon all these\r\n     points, and as they were perfectly acquainted with the Tartar\r\n     language, they expressed themselves always in becoming terms;\r\n     insomuch that the Grand Khan, holding them in high\r\n     estimation, frequently commanded their attendance.[16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: III. PART OF A LANDSCAPE BY CHAO MÊNG-FU]\r\n\r\nThe Great Khan finally decided to send these two intelligent strangers\r\nback to their own land on a mission from himself to the Pope, asking for\r\na hundred men of learning to be sent to teach and preach to his Tartars,\r\nand for some holy oil from the lamp which burned over Christ's sepulchre\r\nin Jerusalem. He provided them with a golden tablet of honour, which\r\nacted as a passport and secured that they should be entertained and\r\ntheir journey facilitated from city to city in all his dominions, and so\r\nthey set forth once more upon their homeward journey, But they were\r\ndelayed by the dangers and difficulties of travel, 'the extreme cold,\r\nthe snow, the ice, and the flooding of the rivers', and it was three\r\nyears before they at last reached Acre in the April of 1269, and finding\r\nthat the Pope had died the year before, and that no election had yet\r\nbeen made, so that they could not immediately accomplish their mission,\r\nthey decided to visit their home again, and so went back to Venice.\r\nThere Nicolo found that his wife, who had been with child at his\r\ndeparture, was dead, leaving behind her a son Marco, our young\r\nhaunter of quays.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IV. MADAME EGLENTYNE AT HOME]\r\n\r\nThis was the marvellous tale which the same Marco drank in from the lips\r\nof his new-found father and uncle. But more marvels were to come. For\r\ntwo years the Venetians remained at home, awaiting the election of a\r\nPope in order to deliver the Great Khan's letters; but no election was\r\nmade, and at last, fearing that Kublai might suspect them of playing him\r\nfalse, they decided to return to the East, and this time they took with\r\nthem Marco, now a well-grown lad of sixteen or seventeen years with a\r\nbright eye that looked everywhere and took in everything, observant and\r\nsober beyond his age. But when they got as far as Ayas on the Gulf of\r\nScanderoon, news was brought them of the election of Tebaldo di Piacenza\r\nas Pope Gregory X, and as Tebaldo had already interested himself in\r\ntheir mission, they returned with all speed to Acre, and obtained from\r\nhim letters to the Khan (they had already visited Jerusalem and provided\r\nthemselves with some of the holy oil), and two Dominican friars, 'men of\r\nletters and science as well as profound theologians,' though not the\r\nhundred men of learning for whom the Khan had asked; and so they set out\r\nagain from Acre in November 1271. The Dominicans may have been profound\r\ntheologians, but they were somewhat chicken-hearted adventurers, and\r\nwhen rumours reached them of wars in the district of Armenia, through\r\nwhich they had to pass, they hastily handed over their letters to the\r\nVenetians, put themselves under the protection of the Knights Templars,\r\nand scuttled back to the coast and safety as fast as they could go,\r\nleaving the Polos, 'undismayed by perils and difficulties, to which they\r\nhad long been inured,' to proceed alone. Assuredly, St Francis crows\r\nover St Dominic somewhere in the courts of Heaven; his friars never\r\nfeared for their skins, as they travelled blithely into the heat of\r\nIndia and the cold of central Asia; and it is easy to imagine the\r\ncomments of fat William of Rubruck upon the flight of the profound\r\ntheologians.\r\n\r\nThe account of this second journey of the Polos may be read in the\r\nwonderful book which Marco afterwards wrote to describe the wonders of\r\nthe world. They went from Lajazzo through Turcomania, past Mount Ararat,\r\nwhere Marco heard tell that Noah's ark rested, and where he first heard\r\nalso of the oil wells of Baku and the great inland sea of Caspian. Past\r\nMosul and Bagdad they went, through Persia, where brocades are woven and\r\nmerchants bring caravan after caravan of treasures, to Hormuz, on the\r\nPersian Gulf, into which port put the ships from India, laden with\r\nspices, drugs, scented woods, and jewels, gold tissues and elephants'\r\nteeth. Here they meant to take ship, but they desisted, perhaps because\r\nthey feared to trust themselves to the flimsy nailless vessels in which\r\nthe Arabs braved the dangers of the Indian Ocean. So they turned north\r\nagain and prepared to make the journey by land. They traversed the salt\r\ndesert of Kerman, through Balk and Khorassan to Badakhshan, where there\r\nare horses bred from Alexander the Great's steed Bucephalus, and ruby\r\nmines and lapis lazuli. It is a land of beautiful mountains and wide\r\nplains, of trout streams and good hunting, and here the brothers\r\nsojourned for nearly a year, for young Marco had fallen ill in the hot\r\nplains: a breath of mountain air blows through the page in which he\r\ndescribes how amid the clean winds his health came back to him. When he\r\nwas well, they went on again, and ascended the upper Oxus to the\r\nhighlands of Pamir, 'the roof of the world' as it has been called in our\r\nown time, a land of icy cold, where Marco saw and described the great\r\nhorned sheep which hunters and naturalists still call after him the\r\n_Ovis Poli_,[17] a land which no traveller (save Benedict Goës, about\r\n1604) described again, until Lieutenant John Wood of the Indian Navy\r\nwent there in 1838. Thence they descended upon Kashgar, Yarkand, and\r\nKhotan, where jade is found, regions which no one visited again until\r\n1860. From Khotan they pushed on to the vicinity of Lake Lob, never to\r\nbe reached again until a Russian explorer got there in 1871. They halted\r\nthere to load asses and camels with provisions, and then, with sinking\r\nhearts, they began the terrible thirty days' journey across the Gobi\r\nDesert. Marco gives a vivid description of its terrors, voices which\r\nseem to call the traveller by name, the march of phantom cavalcades,\r\nwhich lures them off the road at night, spirits which fill the air with\r\nsounds of music, drums and gongs and the clash of arms--all those\r\nillusions which human beings have heard and seen and feared in every\r\ndesert and in every age.\r\n\r\nWhat might this be? A thousand fantasies\r\nBegin to throng into my memory,\r\nOf calling shapes, and beckoning shadows dire,\r\nAnd airy tongues that syllable men's names\r\nOn sands and shores and desert wildernesses.\r\n\r\nAt last they arrived safely at Tangut in the extreme north-west of\r\nChina, and, skirting the frontier across the great steppes of Mongolia,\r\nthey were greeted by the Khan's people, who had been sent forward to\r\nmeet them at the distance of forty days' journey, and so at last they\r\nreached his presence in the May of 1275, having journeyed for three\r\nyears and a half.\r\n\r\nThe Great Khan received the Polos kindly, listened attentively to the\r\naccount which they gave of their mission, commended them for their zeal\r\nand fidelity, and received the holy oil and the Pope's gifts with\r\nreverence. He then observed the boy Marco, now a 'young gallant' and\r\npersonable enough, no doubt, and inquired who he was, and Nicolo made\r\nanswer, 'Sire, this is your servant, and my son,' to which the Khan\r\nreplied, 'He is welcome, and much it pleases me,' and enrolled Marco\r\namong his own attendants. It was the beginning of a long and close\r\nassociation, for Kublai Khan soon found that Marco Polo was both\r\ndiscreet and intelligent, and began to employ him on various missions.\r\nMoreover, Marco, for his part, found that the Great Khan was always\r\ndesirous of learning the manners and customs of the many tribes over\r\nwhom he ruled. Kublai had to the full that noble curiosity which is the\r\nbeginning of wisdom, and it irked him exceedingly that his envoys, good\r\nconscientious men, followed their noses upon his business, looking\r\nneither to right nor to left, and as like as not never even noticed that\r\namong the aboriginal hill tribes of the interior called Miaotzu there\r\nprevailed the peculiar and entertaining custom of the _couvade_, wherein\r\n\r\nChinese go to bed\r\nAnd lie in, in their ladies' stead.[18]\r\n\r\n'The Prince, in consequence,' says Marco, 'held them for no better than\r\nfools and dolts and would say, \"I had far liever hearken about the\r\nstrange things and the manners of the different countries you have seen\r\nthan merely be told of the business you went upon,\"'\r\n\r\nVery different was the habit of the Venetian, who as a lad, had lent ear\r\nso readily to swarthy sailors on the Rialto. He quickly picked up\r\nseveral of the languages current in the Great Khan's empire, and here is\r\nhis account of his proceedings when on a mission to foreign parts:\r\n\r\n     Perceiving that the Great Khan took a pleasure in hearing\r\n     accounts of whatever was new to him respecting the customs\r\n     and manners of people, and the peculiar circumstances of\r\n     distant countries, he endeavoured, wherever he went, to\r\n     obtain correct information on these subjects and made notes\r\n     of all he saw and heard, in order to gratify the curiosity of\r\n     his master. In short, during seventeen years that he\r\n     continued in his service, he rendered himself so useful, that\r\n     he was employed on confidential missions to every part of the\r\n     empire and its dependencies; and sometimes also he travelled\r\n     on his own private account, but always with the consent and\r\n     sanctioned by the authority of the Grand Khan. In such\r\n     circumstances it was that Marco Polo had the opportunity of\r\n     acquiring a knowledge, either by his own observation or by\r\n     what he collected from others, of so many things until his\r\n     time unknown, respecting the Eastern parts of the world, and\r\n     these he diligently and regularly committed to writing....\r\n     And by this means he obtained so much honour that he provoked\r\n     the jealousy of other officers of the court.[19]\r\n\r\nIt is small wonder that when first the lad came back with his reports\r\nthe Great Khan and his courtiers marvelled and exclaimed, 'If this young\r\nman live he will assuredly be a person of great worth and ability.'\r\n\r\nIt was while on these various public missions that Marco Polo journeyed\r\nthrough the provinces of Shansi, Shensi, and Szechuen, and skirted the\r\nedge of Tibet to Yunnan, and entered Northern Burma, lands unknown again\r\nto the West until after 1860. For three years he was himself governor of\r\nthe great city of Yangchow, which had twenty-four towns under its\r\njurisdiction, and was full of traders and makers of arms and military\r\naccoutrements.[20] He visited Karakorum in Mongolia, the old Tartar\r\ncapital, and with his Uncle Maffeo spent three years in Tangut. On\r\nanother occasion he went on a mission to Cochin China, and by sea to the\r\nsouthern states of India, and he has left a vivid picture of the great\r\ntrading cities of Malabar. He might indeed have pondered with Ulysses,\r\n\r\n     I am become a name\r\nFor always roaming with a hungry heart,\r\nMuch have I seen and known, cities of men,\r\nAnd manners, climates, countries, governments,\r\nMyself not least, but honoured of them all.\r\n\r\nHe describes the great capital Cambaluc (Peking) in the north, and the\r\nbeautiful Kinsai (Hangchow) in the south. He describes the Khan's summer\r\npalace at Shandu, with its woods and gardens, its marble palace, its\r\nbamboo pavilion swung like a tent from two hundred silken cords, its\r\nstud of white mares, and its wonder-working magicians. Indeed his\r\ndescription of the summer palace is better known to Englishmen than any\r\nother part of his work, for Shandu is Xanadu, which Coleridge saw in a\r\ndream after he had been reading Marco's book and wove into\r\nwonderful verse:\r\n\r\nIn Xanadu did Kubla Khan\r\n  A stately pleasure dome decree,\r\nWhere Alph the sacred river ran,\r\nPast caverns measureless to man,\r\n  Down to a sunless sea.\r\n\r\nAnd there were gardens bright with sinuous rills\r\n  Where blossomed many an incense bearing tree,\r\nAnd here were forests, ancient as the hills\r\n  Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.\r\n\r\nNor is it only palaces which Marco Polo describes, for he tells of the\r\ngreat canal and inland river trade of China, the exports and imports at\r\nits harbours, the paper money, the system of posts and caravanserais,\r\nwhich linked it together. He gives an unsurpassed picture of that huge,\r\nrich, peaceful empire, full of wealth and commerce and learned men and\r\nbeautiful things, and of its ruler Kublai Khan, one of the noblest\r\nmonarchs who ever sat upon a throne, who, since 'China is a sea that\r\nsalts all the rivers that flow into it,'[21] was far more than a\r\nbarbarous Mongol khan, was in very truth a Chinese emperor, whose house,\r\ncalled by the Chinese the 'Yuan Dynasty', takes its place among the\r\ngreat dynasties of China.\r\n\r\nEven more than Marco Polo tells us he must, indeed, have seen. The\r\nimpersonality of the greater part of the book is its one blemish, for we\r\nwould fain know more of how he lived in China. There is some evidence\r\nthat he consorted with the Mongol conquerors rather than with the\r\nChinese, and that Chinese was not one of the languages which he learned.\r\nHe makes no mention of several characteristic Chinese customs, such as\r\nthe compressed feet of the women, and fishing with cormorants (both of\r\nwhich are described by Ordoric of Pordenone after him); he travelled\r\nthrough the tea districts of Fo-kien, but he never mentions\r\ntea-drinking, and he has no word to say even of the Great Wall.[22] And\r\nhow typical a European he is, in some ways, for all his keen interest in\r\nnew and strange things. 'They are,' he says of the peaceful merchants\r\nand scholars of Suchow, 'a pusillanimous race and solely occupied with\r\ntheir trade and manufactures. In these indeed they display considerable\r\nability, and if they were as enterprising, manly, and warlike as they\r\nare ingenious, so prodigious is their number that they might not only\r\nsubdue the whole of the province, but carry their rule further\r\nstill.'[23] Nearly five hundred years later we find the same judgement\r\nexpressed in different words: 'Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle\r\nof Cathay.' The answer is a question: Would you rather be the\r\npusillanimous Chinese, who painted the landscape roll of which a portion\r\nis reproduced opposite page 52, or the enterprising, manly, and warlike\r\nEuropean of the same period, whose highest achievement in pictorial art\r\nis the picture of Marco Polo's embarkation, reproduced opposite page 21?\r\nWhat is civilization and what progress? Yet Marco Polo shows himself\r\nthroughout his book far from unable to appreciate other standards than\r\nthose of his own land and religion, for of Sakya-muni Buddha he says\r\nthat, 'had he been a Christian he would have been a great saint of our\r\nLord Jesus Christ,' and he could honour Kublai as that great\r\nKhan deserved.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although Marco Polo shows less knowledge of the Chinese\r\nthan one might expect from the extraordinary detail and fidelity of his\r\nobservation in other directions, he must have known many of these\r\ncharming and cultivated people, at Kinsai or Cambaluc, or at the city\r\nwhich he governed. Among others, he must have known the great artist who\r\npainted the roll mentioned above, Chao Mêng-fu, whom the Chinese called\r\n'_Sung ksüeh Tao jen_' or the 'Apostle of Pine Trees and Snow'. He was a\r\nlineal descendant of the founder of the Sung dynasty and a hereditary\r\nofficial. When that dynasty at last fell before the Tartars, he and his\r\nfriend Ch'ien Hsüan, 'the Man of the Jade Pool and Roaring Torrent',\r\nretired into private life. But in 1286 Chao Mêng-fu was summoned to\r\ncourt by Kublai Khan, and, to the indignation of his friend, returned\r\nand became secretary in the Board of War, occupying his time in this\r\npost (what must Marco Polo have thought of him!) in painting his\r\nmarvellous pictures. He became a great favourite of the Khan and was\r\nalways about the court, and Marco Polo must have known him well and\r\nperhaps have watched him at work painting those matchless landscapes,\r\nand those pictures of horses and men for which he was famous. Marco\r\nloved horses, as, indeed, he loved all kinds of sport (of which he had\r\nplenty, for the Khan was a great hunter and hawker), and he has left a\r\nword picture of the white brood mares at Shansi, which may be set beside\r\nChao Mêng-fu's brush picture of the 'Eight Horses in the Park of Kublai\r\nKhan'.[24] He knew, too, perhaps Chao Mêng-fu's wife, the Lady Kuan, who\r\npainted most exquisitely the graceful bamboo and the peony, so loved by\r\nChinese artists, and of whom it is related that 'she would watch the\r\nmoving shadows of the sprays thrown by the moon on the paper windows,\r\nand transfer the fugitive outlines to paper with a few strokes of her\r\nsupple brush, so that every smallest scrap of her work was mounted in\r\nalbums as models for others to copy'.[25] Chao Mêng-fu and the Lady Kuan\r\nhad a son, Chao Yung, who is of special interest to us, for he painted a\r\npicture of a Tangut hunter, and Marco Polo has also given a description\r\nof the Tartar horsemen and of the province of Tangut, where he saw and\r\ndescribed the musk deer and the yak.\r\n\r\nBut we must return to the history of the Polos in China. From time to\r\ntime in Marco's book we hear also of his father and uncle, travelling\r\nabout the empire, growing rich by trade, and amassing a store of those\r\njewels, in the value of which they were so skilled, even helping the\r\nKhan to reduce a rebel town, by constructing siege engines for him on\r\nthe European model, handy Venetians that they were, who could lay their\r\nhands to anything.[27] Without doubt they were proud of their Marco, who\r\nfrom an inquisitive lad had grown to so wise and observant a man, and\r\nhad risen to so high a position. So for seventeen years the three Polos\r\nabode in the Khan's service in China. The long months slipped by; and at\r\nlast they began to feel upon them a longing to see Venice and the\r\nlagoons again, and to hear Mass once more beneath the majestic roof of\r\nSt Mark's before they died. Moreover, Kublai Khan was growing old\r\nhimself, and the favour which he had always shown to them had excited\r\nsome jealousy among his own people, and they feared what might happen\r\nwhen he died. But the old Khan was adamant to all their prayers; wealth\r\nand honours were theirs for the asking, but he would not let them go.\r\nThey might, indeed, have died in China, and we of the West might never\r\nhave heard of Marco Polo or of Kublai Khan, but for a mere accident, a\r\nstroke of fate, which gave them their chance. In 1286 Arghun, the Khan\r\nof Persia, lost by death his favourite wife Bolgana, and, according to\r\nher dying wish, he sent ambassadors to the Court of Peking to ask for\r\nanother bride from her own Mongol tribe. Their overland route home again\r\nwas endangered by a war, and they therefore proposed to return by sea.\r\nJust at that moment, Marco Polo happened to return from a voyage on\r\nwhich he had been sent, and spoke with such assurance of the ease with\r\nwhich it had been accomplished, that the three ambassadors conceived a\r\nstrong desire to take with them all three of these ingenious Venetians,\r\nwho seemed to know so much about ships. Thus it was that the great Khan\r\nwas prevailed upon, very reluctantly, to let them go.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1292 they set sail from the busy port of Zaiton in fourteen\r\nbig Chinese junks (of which Marco, writing of the shipping of the\r\nIndian and China seas, has left an excellent description),[28] with the\r\nthree envoys, the princess, a beautiful girl of seventeen, 'moult bèle\r\ndame at avenant,' says Marco, who had an eye for pretty ladies, and a\r\nlarge suite of attendants. One version of Marco's book says that they\r\ntook with them also the daughter of the king of Mansi, one of those Sung\r\nprincesses who in happier days had wandered beside the lake in Hangchow,\r\nand who had no doubt been brought up at Cambaluc by the care of Kublai\r\nKhan's favourite queen, the Lady Jamui. The voyage was a long and\r\ndifficult one; they suffered lengthy delays in Sumatra, Ceylon, and\r\nSouthern India, occupied by Marco in studying the sea charts of the\r\ncoast of India which the Arab pilots showed him, and adding to his\r\nknowledge of these parts, which he had already visited. Thus it was over\r\ntwo years before the junks reached Persia, and two of the three envoys\r\nand a large number of their suite had died by the way. When at last they\r\nlanded, it was found that Arghun, the prospective bridegroom, had\r\nmeanwhile died too, leaving his throne in the charge of a regent for his\r\nyoung son. But on the regent's advice a convenient solution of the\r\ndifficulty was found by handing the princess over to this prince, and\r\nMarco and his uncles duly conducted her to him in the province of\r\nTimochain, where Marco Polo noticed that the women were 'in my opinion\r\nthe most beautiful in the world', where stood the famed and solitary\r\n_arbor secco_, and where men still told tales of great Alexander and\r\nDarius. There they took leave of their princess, who had come on the\r\nlong voyage to love them like fathers, so Marco says, and wept sorely\r\nwhen they parted. It was while they were still in Persia, where they\r\nstayed for nine months after handing over the princess, that the Polos\r\nreceived news of the death of the Great Khan whom they had served so\r\nfaithfully for so many years. He died at the ripe age of eighty, and\r\nwith his death a shadow fell over central Asia, darkening the shining\r\nyellow roofs of Cambaluc,\r\n\r\n       the barren plains\r\nOf Sericana, where Chineses drive\r\nWith sails and wind their cany waggons light,\r\n\r\nthe minarets of Persia, and the tents of wild Kipchak Tartars, galloping\r\nover the Russian steppes. So wide had been the sway of Kublai Khan. A\r\nshadow fell also upon the heart of Marco Polo. It was as though a door\r\nhad clanged to behind him, never to open again. 'In the course of their\r\njourney,' he says, 'our travellers received intelligence of the Great\r\nKhan having departed this life, which entirely put an end to all\r\nprospects of their revisiting those regions.' So he and his elders went\r\non by way of Tabriz, Trebizond, and Constantinople to Venice, and sailed\r\nup to the city of the lagoons at long last at the end of 1295.\r\n\r\nA strange fairy-tale legend has come down to us about the return of the\r\nPolos. 'When they got thither,' says Ramusio, who edited Marco's book in\r\nthe fifteenth century, 'the same fate befell them as befell Ulysses, who\r\nwhen he returned after his twenty years' wanderings to his native Ithaca\r\nwas recognized by nobody.' When, clad in their uncouth Tartar garb, the\r\nthree Polos knocked at the doors of the Ca' Polo, no one recognized\r\nthem, and they had the greatest difficulty in persuading their relatives\r\nand fellow-Venetians that they were indeed those Polos who had been\r\nbelieved dead for so many years. The story goes that they satisfactorily\r\nestablished their identity by inviting all their kinsmen to a great\r\nbanquet, for each course of which they put on a garment more magnificent\r\nthan the last, and finally, bringing in their coarse Tartar coats, they\r\nripped open the seams and the lining thereof, 'upon which there poured\r\nforth a great quantity of precious stones, rubies, sapphires,\r\ncarbuncles, diamonds, and emeralds, which had been sewn into each coat\r\nwith great care, so that nobody could have suspected that anything was\r\nthere.... The exhibition of such an extraordinary and infinite treasure\r\nof jewels and precious stones, which covered the table, once more filled\r\nall present with such astonishment that they were dumb and almost beside\r\nthemselves with surprise: and they at once recognized these honoured and\r\nvenerated gentlemen in the Ca' Polo, whom at first they had doubted and\r\nreceived them with the greatest honour and reverence.[29] Human nature\r\nhas changed little since the thirteenth century. The precious stones are\r\na legend, but no doubt the Polos brought many with them, for they were\r\njewel merchants by trade; they had had ample opportunities for business\r\nin China, and the Great Khan had loaded them with 'rubies and other\r\nhandsome jewels of great value' to boot. Jewels were the most\r\nconvenient form in which they could have brought home their wealth. But\r\nthe inquiring Marco brought other things also to tickle the curiosity of\r\nthe Venetians, as he lets fall from time to time in his book. He\r\nbrought, for example, specimens of the silky hair of the Tangut yak,\r\nwhich his countrymen much admired, the dried head and feet of a musk\r\ndeer, and the seeds of a dye plant (probably indigo) from Sumatra, which\r\nhe sowed in Venice, but which never came up, because the climate was not\r\nsufficiently warm.[30] He brought presents also for the Doge; for an\r\ninventory made in 1351 of things found in the palace of Marino Faliero\r\nincludes among others a ring given by Kublai Khan, a Tartar collar, a\r\nthree-bladed sword, an Indian brocade, and a book 'written by the hand\r\nof the aforesaid Marco,' called _De locis mirabilibus Tartarorum_.[31]\r\n\r\nThe rest of Marco Polo's life is quickly told. The legend goes that all\r\nthe youth of Venice used to resort to the Ca' Polo in order to hear his\r\nstories, for not even among the foreign sailors on the quays, where once\r\nthe boy Marco had wandered and asked about the Tartars, were stories the\r\nlike of his to be heard. And because he was always talking of the\r\ngreatness of Kublai Khan's dominions, the millions of revenue, the\r\nmillions of junks, the millions of riders, the millions of towns and\r\ncities, they gave him a nickname and jestingly called him Marco\r\n_Milione_, or _Il Milione_, which is, being interpreted, 'Million\r\nMarco'; and the name even crept into the public documents of the\r\nRepublic, while the courtyard of his house became known as the _Corte\r\nMilione_. To return from legend to history, the ancient rivalry between\r\nVenice and Genoa had been growing during Marco Polo's absence, nor had\r\nVenice always prevailed. Often as her galleys sailed,\r\n\r\n        dipping deep\r\nFor Famagusta and the hidden sun\r\nThat rings black Cyprus with a lake of fire, ...\r\nQuesting brown slaves or Syrian oranges,\r\nThe pirate Genoese\r\nHell raked them till they rolled\r\nBlood, water, fruit, and corpses up the hold.\r\n\r\nAt last in 1298, three years after Marco's return, a Genoese fleet under\r\nLamba Doria sailed for the Adriatic, to bate the pride of Venice in her\r\nown sea. The Venetians fitted out a great fleet to meet it, and Marco\r\nPolo, the handy man who knew so much about navigation, albeit more\r\nskilled with Chinese junks than with western ships, went with it as\r\ngentleman commander of a galley. The result of the encounter was a\r\nshattering victory for the Genoese off Curzola. Sixty-eight Venetian\r\ngalleys were burnt, and seven thousand prisoners were haled off to\r\nGenoa, among them Marco Polo, who had now a taste of the results of that\r\nenterprise, manliness, and warfare, whose absence he so deprecated in\r\nthe men of Suchow.\r\n\r\nBut soon there began to run through the streets and courtyards of Genoa\r\na rumour that in prison there lay a certain Venetian captain, with tales\r\nso wonderful to beguile the passing hours that none could tire of\r\nhearing them; and anon the gallants and sages and the bold ladies of\r\nGenoa were flocking, just as the men of the Rialto had flocked before,\r\nto hear his stories of Kublai Khan.\r\n\r\nLord of the fruits of Tartary\r\n  Her rivers silver-pale,\r\nLord of the hills of Tartary,\r\n  Glen, thicket, wood, and dale,\r\nHer flashing stars, her scented breeze,\r\nHer trembling lakes, like foamless seas,\r\nHer bird-delighting citron-trees\r\n  In every purple vale.\r\n\r\n'Messer Marco,' so runs Ramusio's account of the tradition which\r\nlingered in Venice in his day, 'finding himself in this position, and\r\nwitnessing the general eagerness to hear all about Cathay and the Great\r\nKhan, which indeed compelled him daily to repeat his story till he was\r\nweary, was advised to put the matter in writing, so he found means to\r\nget a letter written to his father in Venice, in which he desired the\r\nlatter to send those notes and memoranda which he had brought home\r\nwith him.'\r\n\r\nIt happened that in prison with Marco Polo there lay a certain Pisan\r\nwriter of romances, Rusticiano by name,[32] who had probably been taken\r\nprisoner before at the battle of Melaria (1284), when so many Pisan\r\ncaptives had been carried to Genoa, that the saying arose 'He who would\r\nsee Pisa let him go to Genoa.' Rusticiano was skilled in the writing of\r\nFrench, the language _par excellence_ of romances, in which he had\r\nwritten versions of the Round Table Tales, and in him Marco Polo found a\r\nready scribe, who took down the stories as he told them, in the midst of\r\nthe crowd of Venetian prisoners and Genoese gentlemen, raptly drinking\r\nin all the wonders of Kublai Khan. It was by a just instinct that, when\r\nall was written, Rusticiano prefixed to the tale that same address to\r\nthe lords and gentlemen of the world, bidding them to take heed and\r\nlisten, which he had been wont to set at the beginning of his tales of\r\nTristan and Lancelot and King Arthur: 'Ye Lords, Emperors and Kings,\r\nDukes and Marquises, Counts, Knights and Burgesses and all ye men who\r\ndesire to know the divers races of men and the diversities of the\r\ndifferent regions of the world, take ye this book and cause it to be\r\nread, and here shall ye find the greatest marvels.' But he adds, 'Marco\r\nPolo, a wise and learned citizen of Venice, states distinctly what\r\nthings he saw and what things he heard from others, for this book will\r\nbe a truthful one.' Marco Polo's truthful marvels were more wonderful\r\neven than the exploits of Arthur's knights, and were possibly better\r\nsuited to the respectable Rusticiano's pen, for his only other claim to\r\ndistinction in the eyes of posterity seems to be that in his abridgment\r\nof the Romance of Lancelot he entirely omits the episode (if episode it\r\ncan be called) of the loves of Lancelot and Guinevere. 'Alas,' remarks\r\nhis French editor, 'that the copy of Lancelot which fell into the hands\r\nof poor Francesca of Rimini was not one of those expurgated by\r\nRusticiano!' [33]\r\n\r\nMarco Polo was released from prison (there must have been mourning in\r\nthe palaces of Genoa) and returned to Venice at the end of a year.\r\nSometimes hereafter his name occurs in the records of Venice, as he\r\nmoves about on his lawful occasions.[34] In 1305 we find 'Nobilis\r\nMarchus Polo Milioni' standing surety for a wine smuggler; in 1311 he is\r\nsuing a dishonest agent who owes him money on the sale of musk (he,\r\nMarco, had seen the musk deer in its lair); and in 1323 he is concerned\r\nin a dispute about a party wall. We know too, from his will, that he had\r\na wife named Donata, and three daughters, Fantina, Bellela, and Moreta.\r\nHad he loved before, under the alien skies where his youth was spent,\r\nsome languid, exquisite lady of China, or hardy Tartar maid? Had he\r\nprofited himself from the strange marriage customs of Tibet, of which he\r\nremarks (with one of his very rare gleams of humour), 'En cele contree\r\naurent bien aler les jeume de seize anz en vingt quatre'? Had Fantina,\r\nBellela, and Moreta half-brothers, flying their gerfalcons at the quails\r\nby the shores of the 'White Lake' where the Khan hunted, and telling\r\ntales of the half legendary father, who sailed away for ever when they\r\nwere boys in the days of Kublai Khan? These things we cannot know, nor\r\ncan we ever guess whether he regretted that only daughters sprang from\r\nhis loins in the city of the lagoons, and no Venetian son to go\r\nventuring again to the far-distant country where assuredly he had left a\r\ngood half of his heart. Perhaps he talked of it sometimes to Peter, his\r\nTartar servant, whom he freed at his death 'from all bondage as\r\ncompletely as I pray God to release mine own soul from all sin and\r\nguilt'. Some have thought that he brought Peter the Tartar with him from\r\nthe East, and the thought is a pleasant one; but it is more likely that\r\nhe bought him in Italy, for the Venetians were inveterate slave-owners,\r\nand captive Tartars were held of all the slaves the strongest and best.\r\nSo his life passed; and in 1324 Marco Polo died, honoured much by his\r\nfellow-citizens, after making a will which is still preserved in the\r\nlibrary of St Mark's.\r\n\r\nA characteristic story of his death-bed is related by a Dominican friar,\r\none Jacopo of Acqui, who wrote some time later. 'What he told in the\r\nbook,' says Jacopo, 'was not as much as he had really seen, because of\r\nthe tongues of detractors, who being ready to impose their own lies on\r\nothers, are over hasty to set down as lies what they in their perversity\r\ndisbelieve or do not understand. And because there are many great and\r\nstrange things in that book, which are reckoned past all credence, he\r\nwas asked by his friends on his death-bed to correct the book, by\r\nremoving everything that went beyond the facts. To which his reply was\r\nthat he had not told _one half_ of what he had really seen.'[35] How\r\nwell one can see that last indignant flash of the dying observer, who in\r\nthe long years of his youth had taken notes of strange tribes and\r\ncustoms for the wise and gracious Kublai Khan, and whom little men now\r\ndared to doubt. Indeed, modern discovery has entirely confirmed the\r\nexactitude of Marco Polo's observation. It is true that he sometimes\r\nrepeated some very tall stories which had been told to him, of dog-faced\r\nmen in the Andaman Islands and of the 'male and female islands' so\r\nbeloved of medieval geographers. These were sailors' yarns, and where\r\nMarco Polo reports what he has seen with his own eyes, he reports with\r\ncomplete accuracy, nor does he ever pretend to have seen a place which\r\nhe had not visited. The explorers of our own day, Aurel Stein, Ellsworth\r\nHuntington, and Sven Hedin, travelling in central Asia, have\r\ntriumphantly vindicated him. 'It is,' says an eminent French historian,\r\n'as though the originals of very old photographs had been suddenly\r\nrediscovered: the old descriptions of things which were unchanged could\r\nbe perfectly superimposed upon present reality,'[36] and Huntington and\r\nAurel Stein took with them to the inaccessible districts of central Asia\r\nas guide-books the book of the Chinese pilgrim Hiwen Thsang (seventh\r\ncentury) and the book of Marco Polo, and over and over again found how\r\naccurate were their descriptions.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed almost impossible to exaggerate the extent of Marco Polo's\r\naccomplishment. It is best estimated in the often-quoted words of Sir\r\nHenry Yule, whose edition of his book is one of the great works of\r\nEnglish scholarship:\r\n\r\n     He was the first traveller to trace a route across the whole\r\n     longitude of Asia, naming and describing kingdom after\r\n     kingdom, which he had seen with his own eyes, the desert of\r\n     Persia, the flowering plateaux and wild gorges of Badakhshan,\r\n     the jade-bearing rivers of Khotan, the Mongol steppes, cradle\r\n     of the power that had so lately threatened to swallow up\r\n     Christendom, the new and brilliant court that had been\r\n     established at Cambaluc: the first Travellers to reveal China\r\n     in all its wealth and vastness, its mighty rivers, its huge\r\n     cities, its rich manufactures, its swarming population, the\r\n     inconceivably vast fleets that quickened its seas and inland\r\n     waters; to tell us of the nations on its borders with all\r\n     their eccentricities of manners and worship; of Tibet with\r\n     its sordid devotees; of Burma with its golden pagodas and\r\n     their tinkling crowns; of Laos, of Siam, of Cochin China, of\r\n     Japan, the Eastern Thule, with its rosy pearls and\r\n     golden-roofed palaces; the first to speak of that Museum of\r\n     Beauty and Wonder, still so imperfectly ransacked, the Indian\r\n     Archipelago, source of those aromatics then so highly prized\r\n     and whose origin was so dark; of Java the Pearl of Islands;\r\n     of Sumatra with its many kings, its strange costly products,\r\n     and its cannibal races; of the naked savages of Nicobar\r\n     and Andaman; of Ceylon, the Isle of Gems, with its Sacred\r\n     Mountain and its Tomb of Adam; of India the Great, not as a\r\n     dreamland of Alexandrian fables, but as a country seen and\r\n     partially explored, with its virtuous Brahmans, its obscene\r\n     ascetics, its diamonds and the strange tales of their\r\n     acquisition, its sea-beds of pearl and its powerful sun; the\r\n     first in modern times to give any distinct account of the\r\n     secluded Christian Empire of Abyssinia, to speak, though\r\n     indeed dimly, of Zanzibar with its negroes and its ivory and\r\n     of the vast and distant Madagascar, bordering on the Dark\r\n     Ocean of the South, with its Ruc and other monstrosities; and\r\n     in a remotely opposite region, of Siberia and the Arctic\r\n     Ocean, of dog-sledges, white bears and reindeer-riding\r\n     Tunguses.[37]\r\n\r\nThe knowledge which Marco Polo had thus brought to Europe, the\r\nintercourse between East and West which his experience had shown to be\r\nso desirable, continued to grow after him. Merchants and missionaries\r\nalike travelled by land or sea eastward to Cathay.[38] Another of those\r\nindomitable Franciscan friars, John of Monte Corvino, went out at the\r\nage of fifty and became Archbishop of Peking. Churches and houses of\r\nfriars were founded in some of the Chinese cities. Odoric of Pordenone,\r\nanother friar, and a very good observer too, set forth in 1316 and\r\nsailed round India and through the Spice Islands by the same sea route\r\nby which the Polos had brought their Tartar princess back to Persia, and\r\nso reached Canton, 'a city as big as three Venices ... and all Italy\r\nhath not the amount of craft that this one city hath.' He left a\r\nwonderful account of his travels in China, including descriptions of\r\nPeking and Hangchow, and ends his stories with the words, 'As for me,\r\nfrom day to day I prepare myself to return to those countries, in which\r\nI am content to die, if it pleaseth Him from whom all good things do\r\ncome'--no doubt where he had left his heart, but he died at Udine in\r\nItaly. Later there went out another friar, John Marignolli, who was\r\nPapal Legate to Peking from 1342 to 1346.\r\n\r\nNor was it only missionaries who went to Cathay. Odoric, speaking of the\r\nwonders of Hangchow, refers for confirmation to Venetian traders who\r\nhave visited it: ''Tis the greatest city in the whole world, so great\r\nindeed that I should scarcely venture to tell of it, but that I have met\r\nat Venice people in plenty who have been there'; John of Monte Corvino\r\nwas accompanied by Master Peter of Lucolongo, 'a great merchant,' and\r\nJohn Marignolli mentions a _fondaco_ for the use of Christian merchants,\r\nwhich was attached to one of the Franciscan convents at Zaiton. Above\r\nall, there is Francis Balducci Pegolotti, that intrepid factor who\r\nserved the great commercial house of the Bardi of Florence, and who\r\nwrote a priceless handbook for the use of merchants about 1340. In this\r\nhe gives detailed instructions for the guidance of a merchant, who\r\nwishes to proceed from Tana on the Black Sea by the overland route\r\nacross Asia to Cathay and back again with £12,000 worth of silk in his\r\ncaravan, and remarks casually, in passing, 'The road you travel from\r\nTana to Cathay is perfectly safe, whether by day or night, according to\r\nwhat merchants say who have used it'--'il chanmino dandare dana Tana al\r\nGhattajo _è sichurissimo_![39] Think only of what it all means. Marco\r\nPolo travelling where no man set foot again till the twentieth century.\r\nThe bells of the Christian church ringing sweetly in the ears of the\r\nGreat Khan in Peking. The long road across central Asia perfectly safe\r\nfor merchants. The 'many persons at Venice' who have walked in the\r\nstreets of Hangchow. This is in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth\r\ncenturies, in the despised and hidebound Middle Ages. _È sichurissimo_!\r\nIt takes some of the gilt off Columbus and Vasco da Gama and the age\r\n(forsooth) of 'discovery'.\r\n\r\nBut a change came over everything in the middle of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. Darkness fell again and swallowed up Peking and Hangchow, the\r\ngreat ports, the crowding junks, the noble civilization. No longer was\r\nthe great trade route _sichurissimo_, and no longer did Christian friars\r\nchant their Masses in Zaiton. The Tartar dynasty fell and the new rulers\r\nof China reverted to the old anti-foreign policy; moreover, Islam spread\r\nits conquests all over central Asia and lay like a rampart between the\r\nfar east and west, a great wall of intolerance and hatred stronger by\r\nfar than the great wall of stone which the Chinese had once built to\r\nkeep out the Tartars. All Marco Polo's marvels became no more than a\r\nlegend, a traveller's tale.\r\n\r\nBut that great adventurer was not done for yet. Nearly a century and a\r\nhalf after Marco's death a Genoese sea captain sat poring over one of\r\nthe new printed books, which men were beginning to buy and to hand\r\nabout among themselves. The book which he was reading was the Latin\r\nversion of Marco Polo's travels. He was reading it with intentness and\r\nindeed with passion. As he read he made notes in the margin; on over\r\nseventy pages he made his notes.[40] From time to time he frowned and\r\nturned back and read again the tale of those great ports of Cathay and\r\nthe gold-roofed palaces of Cipangu; and always he wondered how those\r\nlands might be reached, now that the wall of darkness covered central\r\nAsia, and anarchy blocked the road to the Persian Gulf. One day (may we\r\nnot see him?) he lifted his head and smote his hand upon the table. 'I\r\nwill sail west', he said. 'Maybe I shall find the lost island of Antilha\r\nin the western ocean, but maybe on its far rim I shall indeed come to\r\nCipangu, for the world is round, and somewhere in those great seas\r\nbeyond the coast of Europe must lie Marco Polo's rich Cathay. I will\r\nbeseech the kings of England and of Spain for a ship and a ship's\r\ncompany, and the silk and the spices and the wealth shall be theirs. I\r\nwill sail west,' said the Genoese sea captain, and he smote his thigh.\r\n'I will sail west, west, west!' And this was the last of Messer Marco's\r\nmarvels; he discovered China in the thirteenth century, when he was\r\nalive, and in the fifteenth, when he was dead, he discovered America!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_Madame Eglentyne_\r\n\r\nCHAUCER'S PRIORESS IN REAL LIFE\r\n\r\n     Ther was also a Nonne, a Prioresse,\r\n     That of her smyling was ful simple and coy;\r\n     Hir grettest ooth was ne but by sëynt Loy;\r\n     And she was cleped madame Eglentyne.\r\n     Ful wel she song the service divyne,\r\n     Entuned in hir nose ful semely;\r\n     And Frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly,\r\n     After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,\r\n     For Frensh of Paris was to hir unknowe.\r\n     At mete wel y-taught was she with-alle;\r\n     She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle,\r\n     Ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe.\r\n     Wel coude she carie a morsel and wel kepe,\r\n     That no drope ne fille up-on hir brest.\r\n     In curteisye was set ful muche hir lest.\r\n     Hir over lippe wyped she so clene,\r\n     That in hir coppe was no ferthing sene\r\n     Of grece, whan she dronken haddie hir draughte\r\n     Ful semely after hir mete she raughte,\r\n     And sikerly she was of greet disport,\r\n     And ful plesaunt and amiable of port,\r\n     And peyned hir to countrefete chere\r\n     Of court, and been estatlich of manere,\r\n     And to be holden digne of reverence.\r\n     But, for to speken of hir conscience,\r\n     She was so charitable and so pitous,\r\n     She wolde wepe, if that she sawe a mous\r\n     Caught in a trap, if it were deed or bledde.\r\n     Of smale houndes had she, that she fedde\r\n     With rosted flesh, or milk and wastel-breed.\r\n     But sore weep she if oon of hem were deed,\r\n     Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte:\r\n     And al was conscience and tendre herte\r\n     Ful semely hir wimpel pinched was:\r\n     Hir nose tretys; her eyen greye as glas;\r\n     Hir mouth ful smal, and ther-to softe and reed;\r\n     But sikerly she hadde a fair foreheed;\r\n     It was almost a spanne brood, I trowe;\r\n     For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.\r\n     Ful fetis was hir cloke, as I was war.\r\n     Of smal coral aboute hir arm she bar\r\n     A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene;\r\n     And ther-on heng a broche of gold ful shene,\r\n     On which ther was first write a crowned A,\r\n     And after, _Amor vincit omnia!_\r\n\r\n          --GEOFFREY CHAUCER\r\n\r\n               _Prologue_ to the _Canterbury Tales_\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one knows Chaucer's description of the Prioress, Madame Eglentyne,\r\nwho rode with that very motley and talkative company on the way to\r\nCanterbury. There is no portrait in his gallery which has given rise to\r\nmore diverse comment among critics. One interprets it as a cutting\r\nattack on the worldliness of the Church; another thinks that Chaucer\r\nmeant to draw a charming and sympathetic picture of womanly gentleness;\r\none says that it is a caricature, another an ideal; and an American\r\nprofessor even finds in it a psychological study of thwarted maternal\r\ninstinct, apparently because Madame Eglentyne was fond of little dogs\r\nand told a story about a schoolboy. The mere historian may be excused\r\nfrom following these vagaries. To him Chaucer's Prioress, like Chaucer's\r\nmonk and Chaucer's friar, will simply be one more instance of the almost\r\nphotographic accuracy of the poet's observation. The rippling\r\nundercurrent of satire is always there; but it is Chaucer's own peculiar\r\nsatire--mellow, amused, uncondemning, the most subtle kind of satire,\r\nwhich does not depend upon exaggeration. The literary critic has only\r\nChaucer's words and his own heart, or sometimes (low be it spoken) his\r\nown desire to be original, by which to guide his judgement. But the\r\nhistorian knows; he has all sorts of historical sources in which to\r\nstudy nunneries, and there he meets Chaucer's Prioress at every turn.\r\nAbove all, he has the bishop's registers.\r\n\r\nFor a long time historians foolishly imagined that kings and wars and\r\nparliaments and the jury system alone were history; they liked\r\nchronicles and Acts of Parliament, and it did not strike them to go and\r\nlook in dusty episcopal archives for the big books in which medieval\r\nbishops entered up the letters which they wrote and all the complicated\r\nbusiness of running their dioceses. But when historians did think of\r\nlooking there, they found a mine of priceless information about almost\r\nevery side of social and ecclesiastical life. They had to dig for it of\r\ncourse, for almost all that is worth knowing has to be mined like\r\nprecious metals out of a rock; and for one nugget the miner often has to\r\ngrub for days underground in a mass of dullness; and when he has got it\r\nhe has to grub in his own heart, or else he will not understand it. The\r\nhistorians found fine gold in the bishops' registers, when once they\r\npersuaded themselves that it was not beneath their dignity to grub\r\nthere. They found descriptions of vicarages, with all their furniture\r\nand gardens; they found marriage disputes; they found wills full of\r\nentertaining legacies to people dead hundreds of years ago; they found\r\nexcommunications; they found indulgences to men for relieving the poor,\r\nrepairing roads, and building bridges, long before there was any poor\r\nlaw, or any county council; they found trials for heresy and witchcraft;\r\nthey found accounts of miracles worked at the tombs of saints and even\r\nof some quite unsaintly people, such as Thomas of Lancaster, and Edward\r\nII, and Simon de Montfort; they found lists of travelling expenses when\r\nthe bishops rode round their dioceses; in one they even found a minute\r\naccount of the personal appearance of Queen Philippa, then a little girl\r\nat her father's Court at Hainault, whom the Bishop of Exeter had been\r\nsent to inspect, in order to see if she were pretty and good enough to\r\nmarry Edward III: she was nine years old, and the bishop said that her\r\nsecond teeth were whiter than her first teeth and that her nose was\r\nbroad but not snub, which was reassuring for Edward.[1] Last, but not\r\nleast, the historians found a multitude of documents about monasteries,\r\nand among these documents they found visitation records, and among\r\nvisitation records they found Chaucer's Prioress, smiling full simple\r\nand coy, fair forehead, well-pinched wimple, necklace, little dogs, and\r\nall, as though she had stepped into a stuffy register by mistake for the\r\n_Canterbury Tales_ and was longing to get out again.\r\n\r\nThis was the reason that Madame Eglentyne got into the register. In the\r\nMiddle Ages all the nunneries of England, and a great many of the\r\nmonasteries, used to be visited at intervals by the bishop of their\r\ndiocese--or by somebody sent by him--in order to see whether they were\r\nbehaving properly. It was rather like the periodical visitation of a\r\nschool by one of Her Majesty's inspectors, only what happened was very\r\ndifferent. When Her Majesty's inspector comes he does not sit in state\r\nin the hall, and call all the inmates in front of him one after another,\r\nfrom the head mistress to the smallest child in the first form, and\r\ninvite them to say in what way they think the school is not being\r\nproperly run, and what complaints they have to make against their\r\nmistresses and which girl habitually breaks the rules--all breathed\r\nsoftly and privately into his ear, with no one to overhear them. But\r\nwhen the bishop came to visit a nunnery, that is precisely what\r\nhappened. First of all, he sent a letter to say he was coming, and to\r\nbid the nuns prepare for him. Then he came, with his clerks and a\r\nlearned official or two, and was met solemnly by the prioress and all\r\nthe nuns, and preached a sermon in their church, and was entertained,\r\nperhaps, to dinner. And then he prepared to examine them, and one by one\r\nthey came before him, in order of rank, beginning with the prioress, and\r\nwhat they had to do was to tell tales about each other. He wanted to\r\nfind out if the prioress were ruling well, and if the services were\r\nproperly performed, and if the finances were in good order, and if\r\ndiscipline were maintained; and if any nun had a complaint, then was the\r\ntime to make it.\r\n\r\nAnd the nuns were full of complaints. A modern schoolgirl would go pale\r\nwith horror over their capacity for tale-bearing. If one nun had boxed\r\nher sister's ears, if another had cut church, if another were too much\r\ngiven to entertaining friends, if another went out without a licence, if\r\nanother had run away with a wandering fluteplayer, the bishop was sure\r\nto hear about it; that is, unless the whole convent were in a disorderly\r\nstate, and the nuns had made a compact to wink at each other's\r\npeccadilloes; and not to betray them to the bishop, which occasionally\r\nhappened. And if the prioress were at all unpopular he was quite certain\r\nto hear all about her. 'She fares splendidly in her own room and never\r\ninvites us,' says one nun; 'She has favourites,' says another, 'and\r\nwhen she makes corrections she passes lightly over those whom she likes,\r\nand speedily punishes those whom she dislikes'; 'She is a fearful\r\nscold,' says a third; 'She dresses more like a secular person than a\r\nnun, and wears rings and necklaces,' says a fourth; 'She goes\r\nout riding to see her friends far too often,' says a fifth;\r\n'She-is-a-very-bad-business-woman-and-she-has-let-the-house-get-into-\r\ndebt-and-the-church-is-falling about-our-ears-and-we-don't-get-enough-\r\nfood-and-she-hasn't-given-us-any-clothes-for-two-years-and-she-has-sold-\r\nwoods-and farms-without-your-licence-and-she-has-pawned-our-best-set-of\r\nspoons; and no wonder, when she never consults us in any business as she\r\nought to do.' They go on like that for pages, and the bishop must often\r\nhave wanted to put his fingers in his ears and shout to them to stop;\r\nespecially as the prioress had probably spent half an hour, for her\r\npart, in telling him how disobedient and ill-tempered, and thoroughly\r\nbadly behaved the nuns were.\r\n\r\nAll these tales the bishop's clerk solemnly wrote down in a big book,\r\nand when the examination was over the bishop summoned all the nuns\r\ntogether again. And if they had answered 'All is well', as they\r\nsometimes did, or only mentioned trivial faults, he commended them and\r\nwent his way; and if they had shown that things really were in a bad\r\nway, he investigated particular charges and scolded the culprits and\r\nordered them to amend, and when he got back to his palace, or the manor\r\nwhere he was staying, he wrote out a set of injunctions, based on the\r\ncomplaints, and saying exactly how things were to be improved; and of\r\nthese injunctions one copy was entered in his register and another was\r\nsent by hand to the nuns, who were supposed to read it aloud at\r\nintervals and to obey everything in it. We have in many bishops'\r\nregisters these lists of injunctions, copied into them by the bishops'\r\nclerks, and in some, notably in a splendid fifteenth-century Lincoln\r\nregister, belonging to the good bishop Alnwick, we have also the\r\nevidence of the nuns, just as it was taken down from their chattering\r\nmouths, and these are the most human and amusing of all medieval\r\nrecords. It is easy to see what important historical documents\r\nvisitation reports are, especially in a diocese like Lincoln, which\r\npossesses an almost unbroken series of registers, ranging over the three\r\ncenturies before the Dissolution, so that one can trace the whole\r\nhistory of some of the nunneries by the successive visitations.\r\n\r\nLet us see what light the registers will throw upon Madame Eglentyne,\r\nbefore Chaucer observed her mounting her horse outside the Tabard Inn.\r\nDoubtless she first came to the nunnery when she was quite a little\r\ngirl, because girls counted as grown up when they were fifteen in the\r\nMiddle Ages; they could be married out of hand at twelve, and they could\r\nbecome nuns for ever at fourteen. Probably Eglentyne's father had three\r\nother daughters to marry, each with a dowry, and a gay young spark of a\r\nson, who spent a lot of money on fashionable suits.\r\n\r\nEmbroidered ... as it were a mede\r\nAll ful of fresshe flowers white and rede.\r\n\r\nSo he thought he had better settle the youngest at once; and he got\r\ntogether a dowry (it was rarely possible to get into a nunnery without\r\none, though Church law really forbade anything except voluntary\r\nofferings), and, taking Eglentyne by the hand one summer day, he popped\r\nher into a nunnery a few miles off, which had been founded by his\r\nancestors. We may even know what it cost him; it was rather a select,\r\naristocratic house, and he had to pay an entrance fee of £200 in modern\r\nmoney; and then he had to give Eglentyne her new habit and a bed, and\r\nsome other furniture; and he had to make a feast on the day she became a\r\nnun, and invite all the nuns and all his own friends; and he had to tip\r\nthe friar, who preached the sermon; and, altogether, it was a great\r\naffair.[2] But the feast would not come at once, because Eglentyne would\r\nhave to remain a novice for some years, until she was old enough to take\r\nthe vows. So she would stay in the convent and be taught how to sing and\r\nto read, and to talk French of the school of Stratford-atte-Bowe with\r\nthe other novices. Perhaps she was the youngest, for girls often did not\r\nenter the convent until they were old enough to decide for themselves\r\nwhether they wanted to be nuns; but there were certainly some other\r\nquite tiny novices learning their lessons; and occasionally there would\r\nbe a little girl like the one whose sad fate is recorded in a dull\r\nlaw-book, shut up in a nunnery by a wicked stepfather who wanted her\r\ninheritance (a nun could not inherit land, because she was supposed to\r\nbe dead to the world), and told by the nuns that the devil would fly\r\naway with her if she tried to set foot outside the door.[3] However,\r\nEglentyne had a sunny disposition and liked life in the nunnery, and had\r\na natural aptitude for the pretty table manners which she learnt there,\r\nas well as for talking French, and though she was not at all prim and\r\nliked the gay clothes and pet dogs which she used to see at home in her\r\nmother's bower, still she had no hesitation at all about taking the veil\r\nwhen she was fifteen, and indeed she rather liked the fuss that was made\r\nof her, and being called _Madame_ or _Dame_, which was the courtesy\r\ntitle always given to a nun.\r\n\r\nThe years passed and Eglentyne's life jogged along peacefully enough\r\nbehind the convent walls. The great purpose for which the nunneries\r\nexisted, and which most of them fulfilled not unworthily, was the praise\r\nof God. Eglentyne spent a great deal of her time singing and praying in\r\nthe convent church, and, as we know,\r\n\r\nFul wel she song the service divyne,\r\nEntuned in hir nose ful semely.\r\n\r\nThe nuns had seven monastic offices to say every day. About 2 a.m. the\r\nnight office was said; they all got out of bed when the bell rang, and\r\nwent down in the cold and the dark to the church choir and said Matins,\r\nfollowed immediately by Lauds. Then they went back to bed, just as the\r\ndawn was breaking in the sky, and slept again for three hours, and then\r\ngot up for good at six o'clock and said Prime. After that there followed\r\nTierce, Sext, None, Vespers, and Compline, spread at intervals through\r\nthe day. The last service, compline, was said at 7 p.m. in winter, and\r\nat 8 p.m. in summer, after which the nuns were supposed to go straight\r\nto bed in the dorter, in which connexion one Nun's Rule ordains that\r\n'None shall push up against another wilfully, nor spit upon the stairs\r\ngoing up and down, but if they tread it out forthwith'![4] They had in\r\nall about eight hours' sleep, broken in the middle by the night service.\r\nThey had three meals, a light repast of bread and beer after prime in\r\nthe morning, a solid dinner to the accompaniment of reading aloud in the\r\nmiddle of the day, and a short supper immediately after vespers at 5\r\nor 6 p.m.\r\n\r\nFrom 12 to 5 p.m. in winter and from 1 to 6 p.m. in summer Eglentyne\r\nand her sisters were supposed to devote themselves to manual or brain\r\nwork, interspersed with a certain amount of sober and godly recreation.\r\nShe would spin, or embroider vestments with the crowned monogram M of\r\nthe Blessed Virgin in blue and gold thread, or make little silken purses\r\nfor her friends and finely sewn bands for them to bind round their arms\r\nafter a bleeding. She would read too, in her psalter or in such saints'\r\nlives as the convent possessed, written in French or English; for her\r\nLatin was weak, though she could construe _Amor vincit omnia_. Perhaps\r\nher convent took in a few little schoolgirls to learn their letters and\r\ngood manners with the nuns, and when she grew older she helped to teach\r\nthem to read and sing; for though they were happy, they did not receive\r\na very extensive education from the good sisters. In the summer\r\nEglentyne was sometimes allowed to work in the convent garden, or even\r\nto go out haymaking with the other nuns; and came back round-eyed to\r\nconfide in her confessor that she had seen the cellaress returning\r\ntherefrom seated behind the chaplain on his nag,[5] and had thought what\r\nfun it must be to jog behind stout Dan John.\r\n\r\nExcept for certain periods of relaxation strict silence was supposed to\r\nbe observed in the convent for a large part of the day, and if Eglentyne\r\ndesired to communicate with her sisters, she was urged to do so by means\r\nof signs. The persons who drew up the lists of signs which were in use\r\nin medieval monastic houses, however, combined a preternatural ingenuity\r\nwith an extremely exiguous sense of humour, and the sort of dumb\r\npandemonium which went on at Eglentyne's dinner table must often have\r\nbeen more mirth-provoking than speech. The sister who desired fish would\r\n'wag her hands displayed sidelings in manner of a fish tail'; she who\r\nwanted milk would 'draw her left little finger in manner of milking';\r\nfor mustard one would 'hold her nose in the upper part of her right fist\r\nand rub it'; another for salt would 'fillip with her right thumb and\r\nforefinger over the left thumb'; another desirous of wine would 'move\r\nher forefinger up and down the end of her thumb afore her eye'; and the\r\nguilty sacristan, struck by the thought that she had not provided\r\nincense for the Mass, would 'put her two fingers into her nostrils'. In\r\none such table drawn up for nuns there are no less than 106 signs, and\r\non the whole it is not surprising that the rule of the same nuns enjoins\r\nthat 'it is never lawful to use them without some reason and profitable\r\nneed, for oft-times more hurt hath an evil word, and more offence it may\r\nbe to God'.[6]\r\n\r\nThe nuns, of course, would not have been human if they had not sometimes\r\ngrown a little weary of all these services and this silence; for the\r\nreligious life was not, nor was it intended to be, an easy one. It was\r\nnot a mere means of escape from work and responsibility. In the early\r\ngolden age of monasticism only men and women with a vocation, that is to\r\nsay a real genius for monastic life, entered convents. Moreover, when\r\nthere they worked very hard with hand and brain, as well as with soul,\r\nand so they got variety of occupation, which is as good as a holiday.\r\nThe basis of wise St Benedict's Rule was a nicely adjusted combination\r\nof variety with regularity; for he knew human nature. Thus monks and\r\nnuns did not find the services monotonous, and indeed regarded them as\r\nby far the best part of the day. But in the later Middle Ages, when\r\nChaucer lived, young people had begun to enter monastic houses rather as\r\na profession than as a vocation. Many truly spiritual men and women\r\nstill took the vows, but with them came others who were little suited to\r\nmonastic life, and who lowered its standard, because it was hard and\r\nuncongenial to them. Eglentyne became a nun because her father did not\r\nwant the trouble and expense of finding her a husband, and because being\r\na nun was about the only career for a well-born lady who did not marry.\r\nMoreover, by this time, monks and nuns had grown more lazy, and did\r\nlittle work with their hands and still less with their heads,\r\nparticularly in nunneries, where the early tradition of learning had\r\ndied out and where many nuns could hardly understand the Latin in which\r\ntheir services were written. The result was that monastic life began to\r\nlose that essential variety which St Benedict had designed for it, and\r\nas a result the regularity sometimes became irksome, and the series of\r\nservices degenerated into a mere routine of peculiar monotony, which\r\nmany of the singers could no longer keep alive with spiritual fervour.\r\nThus sometimes (it must not be imagined that this happened in all or\r\neven in the majority of houses) the services became empty forms, to be\r\nhurried through with scant devotion and occasionally with scandalous\r\nirreverence. It was the almost inevitable reaction from too\r\nmuch routine.\r\n\r\nCarelessness in the performance of the monastic hours was an exceedingly\r\ncommon fault during the later Middle Ages, though the monks were always\r\nworse about it than the nuns. Sometimes they 'cut' the services.\r\nSometimes they behaved with the utmost levity, as at Exeter in 1330,\r\nwhere the canons giggled and joked and quarrelled during the services\r\nand dropped hot candle wax from the upper stalls on to the shaven heads\r\nof the singers in the stalls below![7] Sometimes they came late to\r\nmatins, in the small hours after midnight. This fault was common in\r\nnunneries, for the nuns always would insist on having private drinkings\r\nand gossipings in the evening after compline, instead of going straight\r\nto bed, as the rule demanded--a habit which did not conduce to\r\nwakefulness at 1 a.m. Consequently they were somewhat sleepy at matins\r\nand found an almost Johnsonian difficulty in getting up early. Wise St\r\nBenedict foresaw the difficulty, when he wrote in his rule: 'When they\r\nrise for the Divine Office, let them gently encourage one another,\r\nbecause of the excuses made by those that are drowsy.'[8] At the nunnery\r\nof Stainfield in 1519 the bishop discovered that half an hour sometimes\r\nelapsed between the last stroke of the bell and the beginning of the\r\nservice, and that some of the nuns did not sing, but dozed, partly\r\nbecause they had not enough candles, but chiefly because they went late\r\nto bed;[9] and whoever is without sin among us, let him cast the first\r\nstone! There was a tendency also among both monks and nuns to slip out\r\nbefore the end of the service on any good or bad excuse: they had to see\r\nafter the dinner or the guest-house, their gardens needed weeding, or\r\nthey did not feel well. But the most common fault of all was to gabble\r\nthrough the services as quickly as they could in order to get them over.\r\nThey left out the syllables at the beginning and end of words, they\r\nomitted the dipsalma or pause between two verses, so that one side of\r\nthe choir was beginning the second half before the other side had\r\nfinished the first; they skipped sentences, they mumbled and slurred\r\nwhat should have been 'entuned in their nose ful semely', and altogether\r\nthey made a terrible mess of the stately plainsong. So prevalent was\r\nthe fault of gabbling that the Father of Evil was obliged to charter a\r\nspecial Devil called Tittivillus, whose sole business it was to collect\r\nall these dropped syllables and carry them back to his master in a big\r\nbag. In one way or another, we have a good deal of information about\r\nhim, for he was always letting himself be seen by holy men, who\r\ngenerally had a sharp eye for devils. One Latin rhyme distinguishes\r\ncarefully between the contents of his sack: 'These are they who wickedly\r\ncorrupt the holy psalms: the dangler, the gasper, the leaper, the\r\ngalloper, the dragger, the mumbler, the fore-skipper, the fore-runner\r\nand the over-leaper: Tittivillus collecteth the fragments of these men's\r\nwords.'[10] Indeed, a holy Cistercian abbot once interviewed the poor\r\nlittle devil himself and heard about his alarming industry; this is the\r\nstory as it is told in _The Myroure of Oure Ladye_, written for the\r\ndelectation of the nuns of Syon in the fifteenth century: 'We read of a\r\nholy Abbot of the order of Citeaux that while he stood in the choir at\r\nmatins he saw a fiend that had a long and great poke hanging about his\r\nneck and went about the choir from one to another and waited busily\r\nafter all letters and syllables and words and failings that any made;\r\nand them he gathered diligently and put them in his poke. And when he\r\ncame before the Abbot, waiting if aught had escaped him that he might\r\nhave gotten and put in his bag, the Abbot was astonied and afeard of the\r\nfoulness and misshape of him and said unto him: What art thou? And he\r\nanswered and said, I am a poor devil and my name is Tittivillus and I do\r\nmine office that is committed unto me. And what is thine office? said\r\nthe Abbot. He answered: I must each day, he said, bring my master a\r\nthousand pokes full of failings and of negligences and syllables and\r\nwords, that are done in your order in reading and singing and else I\r\nmust be sore beaten.'[11] But there is no reason to suppose that he\r\noften got his beating, though one may be sure that Madame Eglentyne,\r\nbusily chanting through her nose, never gave him the slightest help. In\r\nhis spare moments, when he was not engaged in picking up those\r\nunconsidered trifles which the monks let fall from the psalms,\r\nTittivillus used to fill up odd corners of his sack with the idle talk\r\nof people who gossiped in church; and he also sat up aloft and collected\r\nall the high notes of vain tenors, who sang to their own glory, instead\r\nof to the glory of God, and pitched the chants three notes higher than\r\nthe cracked voices of their elders could rise.\r\n\r\nBut the monotony of convent life sometimes did more than make the nuns\r\nunconscious contributors to Tittivillus's sack. It sometimes played\r\nhavoc with their tempers. The nuns were not chosen for convent life\r\nbecause they were saints. They were no more immune from tantrums than\r\nwas the Wife of Bath, who was out of all charity when other village\r\nwives went into church before her; and sometimes they got terribly on\r\neach others' nerves. Readers of _Piers Plowman_ will remember that when\r\nthe seven deadly sins come in, Wrath tells how he was cook to the\r\nprioress of a convent and, says he,\r\n\r\n     Of wycked wordes I, Wrath ... here wordes imade,\r\n     Til 'thow lixte' and 'thow lixte' ... lopen oute at ones,\r\n     And eyther hitte other ... vnder the cheke;\r\n     Hadde thei had knyves, by Cryst ... her eyther had killed other.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, it is not often that we hear of anything so bad as that\r\nfifteenth-century prioress, who used to drag her nuns round the choir by\r\ntheir veils in the middle of the service, screaming 'Liar!' and\r\n'Harlot!' at them;[12] or that other sixteenth-century lady who used to\r\nkick them and hit them on the head with her fists and put them in the\r\nstocks.[13] All prioresses were not 'ful plesaunt and amiable of port',\r\nor stately in their manner. The records of monastic visitations show\r\nthat bad temper and petty bickering sometimes broke the peace of\r\nconvent life.\r\n\r\nBut we must be back at Eglentyne. She went on living for ten or twelve\r\nyears as a simple nun, and she sang the services very nicely and had a\r\nsweet temper and pretty manners and was very popular. Moreover, she was\r\nof good birth; Chaucer tells us a great deal about her beautiful\r\nbehaviour at table and her courtesy, which shows that she was a lady\r\nborn and bred; indeed, his description of this might have been taken\r\nstraight out of one of the feudal books of deportment for girls; even\r\nher personal beauty--straight nose, grey eyes, and little red\r\nmouth--conforms to the courtly standard. The convents were apt to be\r\nrather snobbish; ladies and rich burgesses' daughters got into them, but\r\npoor and low-born girls never. So the nuns probably said to each other\r\nthat what with her pretty ways and her good temper and her aristocratic\r\nconnexions, wouldn't it be a good thing to choose her for prioress when\r\nthe old prioress died? And so they did, and she had been a prioress for\r\nsome years when Chaucer met her. At first it was very exciting, and\r\nEglentyne liked being called 'Mother' by nuns who were older than\r\nherself, and having a private room to sit in and all the visitors to\r\nentertain. But she soon found that it was not by any means all a bed of\r\nroses; for there was a great deal of business to be done by the head of\r\na house--not only looking after the internal discipline of the convent,\r\nbut also superintending money matters and giving orders to the bailiffs\r\non her estates, and seeing that the farms were paying well, and the\r\ntithes coming in to the churches which belonged to the nunnery, and that\r\nthe Italian merchants who came to buy the wool off her sheeps' backs\r\ngave a good price for it. In all this business she was supposed to take\r\nthe advice of the nuns, meeting in the chapter-house, where all business\r\nwas transacted. I am afraid that sometimes Eglentyne used to think that\r\nit was much better to do things by herself, and so she would seal\r\ndocuments with the convent seal without telling them. One should always\r\ndistrust the head of an office or school or society who says, with a\r\nself-satisfied air, that it is much more satisfactory to do the thing\r\nherself than to depute it to the proper subordinates; it either means\r\nthat she is an autocrat, or else that she cannot organize. Madame\r\nEglentyne was rather an autocrat, in a good-natured sort of way, and\r\nbesides she hated bother. So she did not always consult the nuns; and I\r\nfear too (after many researches into that past of hers which Chaucer\r\nforgot to mention) that she often tried to evade rendering an account of\r\nincome and expenditure to them every year, as she was supposed to do.\r\n\r\nThe nuns, of course, objected to this; and the first time the bishop\r\ncame on his rounds they complained about it to him. They said, too, that\r\nshe was a bad business woman and got into debt; and that when she was\r\nshort of money she used to sell woods belonging to the convent, and\r\npromise annual pensions to various people in return for lump sums down,\r\nand lease out farms for a long time at low rates, and do various other\r\nthings by which the convent would lose in the long run. And besides,\r\nshe had let the roof of the church get into such ill repair that rain\r\ncame through the holes on to their heads when they were singing; and\r\nwould my lord bishop please to look at the holes in their clothes and\r\ntell her to provide them with new ones? Other wicked prioresses used\r\nsometimes even to pawn the plate and jewels of the convent, to get money\r\nfor their own private purposes. But Eglentyne was not at all wicked or\r\ndishonest, though she was a bad manager; the fact was that she had no\r\nhead for figures. I am _sure_ that she had no head for figures; you have\r\nonly got to read Chaucer's description of her to know that she was not a\r\nmathematician. Besides the nuns were exaggerating: their clothes were\r\nnot in holes, only just a little threadbare. Madame Eglentyne was far\r\ntoo fastidious to allow ragged clothes about her; and as to the roof of\r\nthe church, she had meant to save enough money to have some tiles put on\r\nto it, but it really _was_ very hard to make two ends meet in a medieval\r\nnunnery, especially if (as I repeat) you had no head for figures.\r\nProbably the bishop saw how the land lay, so he ordered her never to do\r\nanything without consulting the convent, and he shut up the common seal\r\nin a box with three different sorts of locks, to which Madame Eglentyne\r\nand two of the senior nuns had the keys, so that she could not open it\r\nalone and so could not seal any business agreement without their\r\nconsent. And he ordered her to keep accounts and present them every year\r\n(there are bundles of her accounts still preserved in the Record\r\nOffice). Finally he deputed a neighbouring rector to act as custodian of\r\nthe business affairs of the house so that she should always have his\r\nhelp. Things went better after that.\r\n\r\nEglentyne, it seems, was never really interested in business, and was\r\nquite pleased to have her time taken up with looking after internal\r\naffairs and entertaining visitors, with an occasional jaunt outside to\r\nsee how the estates were getting on. And she began to find that she\r\ncould lead a much freer and gayer life now that she was a prioress; for\r\nthe prioress of a convent had rooms of her own, instead of sharing the\r\ncommon dormitory and refectory; sometimes she even had a sort of little\r\nhouse with a private kitchen. The abbess of one great nunnery at\r\nWinchester in the sixteenth century had her own staff to look after her,\r\na cook, and an under cook, and a housemaid and a gentlewoman to wait\r\nupon her, like any great lady in the world, and never dined with the\r\nnuns except on state occasions. But a superior generally had with her\r\none nun to act as her companion and assist her in the choir and be a\r\nwitness to her good behaviour; this nun was called her chaplain, and was\r\nsupposed to be changed every year, to prevent favouritism. It will be\r\nremembered that when Madame Eglentyne went on her pilgrimage she took\r\nher nun chaplain with her, as well as three priests; that was because no\r\nnun was ever allowed to go out alone. One of Madame Eglentyne's duties\r\nas prioress was to entertain visitors with her celebrated cheer of\r\ncourt, and we may be sure that she had a great many. Her sisters, who\r\nwere now grand ladies with husbands and manors of their own, and her old\r\nfather, and all the great people of the county came to congratulate her;\r\nand after that they used often to drop in for a dinner of chickens and\r\nwine and wastel bread if they passed the house on a journey, and\r\nsometimes they spent the night there. One or two ladies, whose husbands\r\nwere away at the wars or on a pilgrimage to Rome, even came as paying\r\nguests to the convent and lived there for a whole year, for nothing\r\npleased the country gentlemen or wealthy burgesses better than to use\r\nnunneries as boarding-houses for their women-kind.\r\n\r\nAll this was very disturbing to the peace and quiet of the nuns, and\r\nespecially disturbing were the boarders, for they wore gay clothes, and\r\nhad pet dogs and callers, and set a very frivolous example to the nuns.\r\nAt one nunnery we find a bishop ordering: 'Let Felmersham's wife, with\r\nher whole household and other women, be utterly removed from your\r\nmonastery within one year, seeing that they are a cause of disturbance\r\nto the nuns and an occasion to bad example, by reason of their attire\r\nand of those who come to visit them.'[14] It can be easily imagined\r\n_why_ the bishops objected so much to the reception of these worldly\r\nmarried women as boarders. Just substitute for 'Felmersham's wife' 'the\r\nWife of Bath' and all is explained. That lady was not a person whom a\r\nprioress would lightly refuse; the list of her pilgrimages alone would\r\ngive her the _entrée_ into any nunnery. Smiling her gap-toothed smile\r\nand riding easily upon her ambler, she would enter the gates, and what a\r\nmonth of excitement would pass before she rode away again. I am sure\r\nthat it was she who taught Madame Eglentyne the most fashionable way to\r\npinch a wimple; and she certainly introduced hats 'as broad as is a\r\nbuckler or a targe' and scarlet stockings into some nunneries. The\r\nbishops disliked it all very much, but they never succeeded in turning\r\nthe boarders out for all their efforts, because the nuns always needed\r\nthe money which they paid for their board and lodging.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that this constant intercourse with worldly\r\nvisitors would give rise to the spread of worldly habits in Madame\r\nEglentyne's nunnery. Nuns, after all, were but women, and they had the\r\namiable vanities of their sex. But Authority (with a large A) did not\r\nconsider their vanities amiable at all. It was the view of Authority\r\nthat the Devil had dispatched three lesser D's to be the damnation of\r\nnuns, and those three D's were Dances, Dresses, and Dogs. Medieval\r\nEngland was famous for dancing and mumming and minstrelsy; it was Merry\r\nEngland because, however plague and pestilence and famine and the\r\ncruelties of man to man might darken life, still it loved these things.\r\nBut there were no two views possible about what the Church thought of\r\ndancing; it was accurately summed up by one moralist in the aphorism,\r\n'The Devil is the inventor and governor and disposer of dances and\r\ndancing.' Yet when we look into those accounts which Madame Eglentyne\r\nrendered (or did not render) to her nuns at the end of every year, we\r\nshall find payments for wassail at New Year and Twelfth Night, for May\r\ngames, for bread and ale on bonfire nights, for harpers and players at\r\nChristmas, for a present to the Boy Bishop on his rounds, and perhaps\r\nfor an extra pittance when the youngest schoolgirl was allowed to dress\r\nup and act as abbess of the convent for the whole of Innocents' Day. And\r\nwhen we look in the bishops' registers we shall find Madame Eglentyne\r\nforbidden 'all manner of minstrelsy, interludes, dancing or revelling\r\nwithin your holy place'; and she would be fortunate indeed if her bishop\r\nwould make exception for Christmas, 'and other honest times of\r\nrecreation among yourselves used in absence of seculars in all wise'.\r\nSomehow one feels an insistent conviction that her cheer of court\r\nincluded dancing.[15]\r\n\r\nThen, again, there were the fashionable dresses which the visitors\r\nintroduced into nunneries. It is quite certain that Madame Eglentyne\r\nwas not unmoved by them; and it is a sad fact that she began to think\r\nthe monastic habit very black and ugly, and the monastic life very\r\nstrict; and to decide that if some little amenities were imported into\r\nit no one would be a penny the worse, and perhaps the bishop would not\r\nnotice. That is why, when Chaucer met her,\r\n\r\nFul fetis was hir cloke, as I was war,\r\nOf smal coral aboute hir arm she bar\r\nA peire of bedes, gauded al with grene,\r\nAnd ther-on heng a broche of gold ful shene.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, the bishop did notice; the registers are indeed\r\nfull of those clothes of Madame Eglentyne's, and of the even more\r\nfrivolous ones which she wore in the privacy of the house. For more than\r\nsix weary centuries the bishops waged a holy war against fashion in the\r\ncloister, and waged it in vain; for as long as nuns mingled freely with\r\nsecular women, it was impossible to prevent them from adopting secular\r\nmodes. Occasionally a wretched bishop would find himself floundering\r\nunhandily, in masculine bewilderment, through something like a complete\r\ncatalogue of contemporary fashions, in order to specify what the nuns\r\nwere _not_ to wear. Synods sat solemnly, bishops and archbishops shook\r\ntheir grey heads, over golden hairpins and silver belts, jewelled rings,\r\nlaced shoes, slashed tunics, low necks and long trains, gay colours,\r\ncostly cloth, and valuable furs. The nuns were supposed to wear their\r\nveils pinned tightly down to their eyebrows, so that their foreheads\r\nwere completely hidden; but high foreheads happened to be fashionable\r\namong worldly ladies, who even shaved theirs to make them higher, and\r\nthe result was that the nuns could not resist lifting up and spreading\r\nout their veils, for how otherwise did Chaucer _know_ that Madame\r\nEglentyne had such a fair forehead ('almost a spanne broad, I trowe')?\r\nIf she had been wearing her veil properly, it would have been invisible,\r\nand the father of English poetry may be observed discreetly but plainly\r\nwinking the other eye when he puts in that little touch; his\r\ncontemporaries would see the point very quickly. And that brooch and\r\nthat fetis cloak of hers.... Here is what some tale-bearing nuns told\r\nthe Bishop of Lincoln about their Prioress, fifty years after Chaucer\r\nwrote the _Canterbury Tales_. 'The Prioress,' they said with their most\r\nsanctimonious air, wears golden rings exceeding costly, with divers\r\nprecious stones and also girdles silvered and gilded over and silken\r\nveils and she carries her veil too high above her forehead, so that her\r\nforehead, being entirely uncovered, can be seen of all, and she wears\r\nfurs of vair. Also she wears shifts of cloth of Rennes, which costs\r\nsixteen pence the ell. Also she wears kirtles laced with silk and tiring\r\npins of silver and silver gilt and has made all the nuns wear the like.\r\nAlso she wears above her veil a cap of estate, furred with budge. Item,\r\nshe has on her neck a long silken band, in English a lace, which hangs\r\ndown below her breast and there on a golden ring with one diamond.[16]\r\nIs it not Madame Eglentyne to the life? Nothing escaped our good Dan\r\nChaucer's eye, for all that he rode always looking on the ground.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was not only in her dress that the Prioress and her sister\r\nnuns aped the fashions of the world. Great ladies of the day loved to\r\namuse themselves with pet animals; and nuns were quick to follow their\r\nexample. So,\r\n\r\nOf smale houndes had she, that she fedde\r\nWith rosted flesh, or milk and wastel-breed.\r\nBut sore weep she if oon of hem were deed,\r\nOr if men smoot it with a yerde smerte.\r\n\r\nThe visitation reports are full of those little dogs and other animals;\r\nand how many readers of the Prologue know that the smale houndes, like\r\nthe fair forehead and the brooch of gold full sheen, were strictly\r\nagainst the rules? For the bishops regarded pets as bad for discipline,\r\nand century after century they tried to turn the animals out of the\r\nconvents, without the slightest success. The nuns just waited till the\r\nbishop had gone and then whistled their dogs back again. Dogs were\r\neasily the favourite pets, though monkeys, squirrels, rabbits, birds and\r\n(very rarely) cats were also kept. One archbishop had to forbid an\r\nabbess whom he visited to keep _monkeys and a number of dogs_ in her own\r\nchamber and charged her at the same time with stinting her nuns in food;\r\none can guess what became of the roasted flesh or milk and wastel-breed!\r\nIt was a common medieval practice to bring animals into church, where\r\nladies often attended service with dog in lap and men with hawk on\r\nwrist; just as the highland farmer brings his collie with him today.\r\nThis happened in the nunneries too. Sometimes it was the lay-boarders in\r\nthe convents who brought their pets with them; there is a pathetic\r\ncomplaint by the nuns of one house 'that Lady Audley, who boards there,\r\nhas a great abundance of dogs, insomuch that whenever she comes to\r\nchurch there follow her twelve dogs, who make a great uproar in church,\r\nhindering the nuns in their psalmody and the nuns thereby are\r\nterrified!'[17] But often enough the nuns themselves transgressed.\r\nInjunctions against bringing pet dogs into choir occur in several\r\nvisitation reports, the most amusing instance being contained in those\r\nsent to Romsey Abbey by William of Wykeham in 1387, just about the same\r\nyear that Chaucer was writing the _Canterbury Tales_: 'Item,' runs the\r\ninjunction, 'whereas we have convinced ourselves by clear proofs that\r\nsome of the nuns of your house bring with them to church birds, rabbits,\r\nhounds and such like frivolous things, whereunto they give more heed\r\nthan to the offices of the church, with frequent hindrance to their own\r\npsalmody and to that of their fellow nuns and to the grievous peril of\r\ntheir souls--therefore we strictly forbid you all and several, in virtue\r\nof the obedience due to us that ye presume henceforward to bring to\r\nchurch no birds, hounds, rabbits or other frivolous things that promote\r\nindiscipline.... Item, whereas through hunting dogs and other hounds\r\nabiding within your monastic precincts, the alms that should be given\r\nto the poor are devoured and the church and cloister ... are foully\r\ndefiled ... and whereas, through their inordinate noise divine service\r\nis frequently troubled--therefore we strictly command and enjoin you,\r\nLady Abbess, that you remove the dogs altogether and that you suffer\r\nthem never henceforth, nor any other such hounds, to abide within the\r\nprecincts of your nunnery.'[18] But it was useless for any bishop to\r\norder Madame Eglentyne to give up her dogs, she could not even be parted\r\nfrom them on a pilgrimage, though they must have been a great nuisance\r\nin the inns, especially as she was so fussy about their food.\r\n\r\nFor Chaucer's prioress, we must admit, was rather a worldly lady, though\r\nher pretty clothes and little dogs were harmless enough on modern\r\nstandards and one's sympathies are all against the bishops. She\r\nprobably became more worldly as time went on, because she had so many\r\nopportunities for social intercourse. Not only had she to entertain\r\nvisitors in the convent, but often the business of the house took her\r\naway upon journeys and these offered many opportunities for hobnobbing\r\nwith her neighbours. Sometimes she had to go to London to see after a\r\nlaw-suit and that was a great excursion with another nun, or perhaps\r\ntwo, and a priest and several yeomen to look after her. Sometimes she\r\nhad to go and see the bishop, to get permission to take in some little\r\nschoolgirls. Sometimes she went to the funeral of a great man, whom her\r\nfather knew and who left her twenty shillings and a silver cup in his\r\nwill. Sometimes she went to the wedding of one of her sisters, or to be\r\ngodmother to their babies; though the bishops did not like these worldly\r\nties, or the dances and merry-makings which accompanied weddings and\r\nchristenings. Indeed her nuns occasionally complained about her journeys\r\nand said that though she pretended it was all on the business of the\r\nhouse, they had their doubts; and would the bishop please just look into\r\nit. At one nunnery we find the nuns complaining that their house is £20\r\nin debt 'and this principally owing to the costly expenses of the\r\nprioress, because she frequently rides abroad and pretends that she does\r\nso on the common business of the house although it is not so, with a\r\ntrain of attendants much too large and tarries too long abroad and she\r\nfeasts sumptuously, both when abroad and at home and she is very choice\r\nin her dress, so that the fur trimmings of her mantle are worth\r\n100s'![19]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact there was nothing of which the church disapproved\r\nmore than this habit, shared by monks and nuns, of wandering about\r\noutside their cloisters; moralists considered that intercourse with the\r\nworld was at the root of all the evil which crept into the monastic\r\nsystem. The orthodox saying was that a monk out of his cloister was like\r\na fish out of water; and it will be remembered that Chaucer's monk\r\nthought the text not worth an oyster. Indeed most of the monks managed\r\nto swim very well in the air, and the nuns too persisted in taking every\r\nsort of excuse for wandering in the world. Right through the Middle Ages\r\ncouncil after council, bishop after bishop, reformer after reformer,\r\ntried in vain to keep them shut up. The greatest attempt of all began\r\nin 1300, when the pope published a Bull ordering that nuns should\r\nnever, save in very exceptional circumstances, leave their convents and\r\nthat no secular person should be allowed to go in and visit them,\r\nwithout a special licence and a good reason. This will make the modern\r\nreader pity the poor nuns, but there is no need, for nobody ever\r\nsucceeded in putting it into force for more than five minutes, though\r\nthe bishops spent over two centuries in trying to do so and were still\r\ntrying in vain when King Henry VIII dissolved the nunneries and turned\r\nall the nuns out into the world for ever, whether they liked it or not.\r\nAt one nunnery in the Lincoln diocese, when the bishop came and\r\ndeposited a copy of the Bull in the house and ordered the nuns to obey\r\nit, they ran after him to the gate when he was riding away and threw the\r\nBull at his head, screaming that they would never observe it.[20] The\r\nmore practical bishops indeed, soon stopped trying to enforce the Bull\r\nas it stood and contented themselves with ordering that nuns were not to\r\ngo out or pay visits too often, or without a companion, or without\r\nlicence, or without a good reason. But even in this they were not very\r\nsuccessful, because the nuns were most prolific in excellent reasons why\r\nthey should go out. Sometimes they said that their parents were ill; and\r\nthen they would go away to smooth the pillow of the sick. Sometimes they\r\nsaid that they had to go to market to buy herrings. Sometimes they said\r\nthat they had to go to confession at a monastery. Sometimes it is really\r\ndifficult to imagine _what_ they said. What are we to think, for\r\ninstance, of that giddy nun 'who on Monday night did pass the night with\r\nthe Austin friars at Northampton and did dance and play the lute with\r\nthem in the same place until midnight, and on the night following she\r\npassed the night with the Friars' preachers at Northampton, luting and\r\ndancing in like manner'?[21] Chaucer told us how the friar loved harping\r\nand how his eyes twinkled like stars in his head when he sang, but\r\nfailed perhaps to observe that he had lured Madame Eglentyne into\r\na dance.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed difficult to see what 'legitimate' excuses the nuns can\r\nhave made for all their wandering about in the streets and the fields\r\nand in and out of people's houses, and it is sorely to be feared that\r\neither they were too much of a handful for Madame Eglentyne, or else she\r\nwinked at their doings. For somehow or other one suspects that she had\r\nno great opinion of bishops. After all Chaucer would never have met her,\r\nif she had not managed to circumvent her own, since if there was one\r\nexcuse for wandering of which the bishops thoroughly disapproved, it was\r\nprecisely the excuse of pilgrimages. Madame Eglentyne was not quite as\r\nsimple and coy as she looked. How many of the literary critics, who\r\nchuckle over her, know that she never ought to have got into the\r\nPrologue at all? The Church was quite clear in its mind that pilgrimages\r\nfor nuns were to be discouraged. As early as 791 a council had forbidden\r\nthe practice and in 1195 another at York decreed, 'In order that the\r\nopportunity of wandering may be taken from nuns we forbid them to take\r\nthe path of pilgrimage.' In 1318 an archbishop of York strictly forbade\r\nthe nuns of one convent to leave their house 'by reason of any vow of\r\npilgrimage which they might have taken. If any had taken such vows she\r\nwas to say as many psalters as it would have taken days to perform the\r\npilgrimage so rashly vowed.'[22] One has a melancholy vision of poor\r\nMadame Eglentyne saying psalters interminably through her tretys nose,\r\ninstead of jogging along so gaily with her motley companions and telling\r\nso prettily her tale of little St Hugh. Such prohibitions might be\r\nmultiplied from medieval records; and indeed it is unnecessary to go\r\nfurther than Chaucer to understand why it was that bishops offered such\r\nstrenuous opposition to pilgrimages for nuns; one has only to remember\r\nsome of the folk, in whose company the prioress travelled and some of\r\nthe tales they told. If one could only be certain, for instance, that\r\nshe rode all the time with her nun and her priests, or at least between\r\nthe Knight and the poor Parson of a town! But there were also the Miller\r\nand the Summoner and (worst of all) that cheerful and engaging sinner,\r\nthe Wife of Bath. It is really quite disturbing to think what additional\r\ndetails the Wife of Bath may have given the prioress about her\r\nfive husbands.\r\n\r\nThis then was Chaucer's prioress in real life, for the poet who drew her\r\nwas one of the most wonderful observers in the whole of English\r\nliterature. We may wade through hundreds of visitation reports and\r\ninjunctions and everywhere the grey eyes of his prioress will twinkle at\r\nus out of their pages, and in the end we must always go to Chaucer for\r\nher picture, to sum up everything that historical records have taught\r\nus. As the bishop found her, so he saw her, aristocratic,\r\ntender-hearted, worldly, taking pains to 'countrefete there of court';\r\nliking pretty clothes and little dogs; a lady of importance, attended by\r\na nun and three priests; spoken to with respect by the none too\r\nmealy-mouthed host--no 'by Corpus Dominus' or 'cokkes bones' or 'tel on\r\na devel wey' for her, but 'cometh neer, my lady prioress,' and\r\n\r\nMy lady Prioresse, by your leve\r\nIf that I wiste I sholde yow nat greve,\r\nI wolde demen that ye tellen sholde\r\nA tale next, if so were that ye wolde.\r\nNow wol ye vouche-sauf, my lady dere?\r\n\r\nHe talks to no one else like that, save perhaps to the knight. Was she\r\nreligious? Perhaps; but save for her singing the divine service and for\r\nher lovely address to the Virgin, at the beginning of her tale, Chaucer\r\ncan find but little to say on the point;\r\n\r\nBut for speken of hir conscience (he says)\r\nShe was so charitable and so pitous,\r\n\r\nand then, as we are waiting to hear of her almsgiving to the poor--that\r\nshe would weep over a mouse in a trap, or a beaten puppy, says Chaucer.\r\nA good ruler of her house? again, doubtless. But when Chaucer met her\r\nthe house was ruling itself somewhere at the 'shire's ende'. The world\r\nwas full of fish out of water in the fourteenth century, and, by sëynt\r\nLoy, said Madame Eglentyne, swearing her greatest oath, like Chaucer's\r\nmonk, she held that famous text not worth an oyster. So we take our\r\nleave of her, characteristically on the road to Canterbury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_The Ménagier's Wife_\r\n\r\nA PARIS HOUSEWIFE IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n     The sphere of woman is the home.\r\n         --_Homo Sapiens_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men of the middle, as indeed of all ages, including our own, were\r\nvery fond of writing books of deportment telling women how they ought to\r\nbehave in all the circumstances of their existence, but more\r\nparticularly in their relations with their husbands. Many of these books\r\nhave survived, and among them one which is of particular interest,\r\nbecause of the robust good sense of its writer and the intimate and\r\nlively picture which it gives of a bourgeois home. Most books of\r\ndeportment were written, so to speak, in the air, for women in general,\r\nbut this was written by a particular husband for a particular wife, and\r\nthus is drawn from life and full of detail, showing throughout an\r\nindividuality which its compeers too often lack. If a parallel be sought\r\nto it, it is perhaps to be found not in any other medieval treatise but\r\nin those passages of Xenophon's _Economist_, in which Isomachus\r\ndescribes to Socrates the training of a perfect Greek wife.\r\n\r\nThe Ménagier de Paris (the Householder or Goodman of Paris, as we might\r\nsay) wrote this book for the instruction of his young wife between 1392\r\nand 1394. He was a wealthy man, not without learning and of great\r\nexperience in affairs, obviously a member of that solid and enlightened\r\n_haute bourgeoisie_, upon which the French monarchy was coming to lean\r\nwith ever-increasing confidence. When he wrote he must have been\r\napproaching old age, and he was certainly over sixty, but he had\r\nrecently married a young wife of higher birth than himself, an orphan\r\nfrom a different province. He speaks several times of her 'very great\r\nyouth', and kept a sort of duenna-housekeeper with her to help and\r\ndirect her in the management of his house; and indeed, like the wife of\r\nIsomachus, she was only fifteen years old when he married her. Modern\r\nopinion is shocked by a discrepancy in age between husband and wife,\r\nwith which the Middle Ages, a time of _ménages de convenance_, was more\r\nfamiliar. 'Seldom,' the Ménagier says, 'will you see ever so old a man\r\nwho will not marry a young woman.' Yet his attitude towards his young\r\nwife shows us that there may have been compensations, even in a marriage\r\nbetween May and January. Time after time in his book there sounds the\r\nnote of a tenderness which is paternal rather than marital, a\r\nsympathetic understanding of the feelings of a wedded child, which a\r\nyounger man might not have compassed. Over all the matter-of-fact\r\ncounsels there seems to hang something of the mellow sadness of an\r\nautumn evening, when beauty and death go ever hand in hand. It was his\r\nwife's function to make comfortable his declining years; but it was his\r\nto make the task easy for her. He constantly repeats the assurance that\r\nhe does not ask of her an overweening respect, or a service too humble\r\nor too hard, for such is not due to him; he desires only such care as\r\nhis neighbours and kinswomen take of their husbands, 'for to me\r\nbelongeth none save the common service, or less'.\r\n\r\nIn his Prologue, addressed to her, he gives a charming picture of the\r\nscene which led him to write his book: 'You, being of the age of fifteen\r\nyears and in the week that you and I were wed, did pray me that I would\r\nplease to be indulgent to your youth and to your small and ignorant\r\nservice mewards, until that you should have seen and learned more, to\r\nthe hastening whereof you did promise me to set all care and\r\ndiligence, ... praying me humbly, in our bed as I remember, that for the\r\nlove of God I would not correct you harshly before strangers nor before\r\nour own folk, 'but that I would correct you each night or from day to\r\nday in our chamber and show you the unseemly or foolish things done in\r\nthe day or days past, and chastise you, if it pleased me, and then you\r\nwould not fail to amend yourself according to my teaching and correction,\r\nand would do all in your power according to my will, as you said. And I\r\nthought well of, and praise and thank you for, what you said to me and I\r\nhave often remembered it since. And know, dear sister[D], that all that\r\nI know you have done since we were wed up to this day, and all that you\r\nshall do hereafter with good intent has been and is good and well hath\r\npleased, pleases and shall please me. For your youth excuses you from\r\nbeing very wise, and will still excuse you in everything that you do\r\nwith good intent to please me. And know that it doth not displease, but\r\nrather pleases me that you should have roses to grow and violets to care\r\nfor and that you should make chaplets and dance and sing, and I would\r\nwell that you should so continue among our friends and those of our\r\nestate, and it is but right and seemly thus to pass the time of your\r\nfeminine youth, provided that you desire and offer not to go to the\r\nfeasts and dances of too great lords, for that is not seemly for you,\r\nnor suitable to your estate nor mine[1].'\r\n\r\n[Footnote D: He addresses her throughout as 'sister', a term of\r\naffectionate respect.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he has not forgotten her request that he would teach and\r\ncorrect her in private, and so he writes a little book (but it was a big\r\nbook before he had finished) to show her how to comport herself; for he\r\nis sorry for this child, who has for long had neither father nor mother,\r\nand who is far from kinswomen who might counsel her, having 'me only' he\r\nsays, 'for whom you have been taken from your kinsfolk and from the land\r\nof your birth.' He has often deliberated the matter and now here is 'an\r\neasy general introduction' to the whole art of being a wife, a\r\nhousewife, and a perfect lady. One characteristic reason, apart from his\r\ndesire to help her and to be comfortable himself (for he was set in his\r\nways), he gives for his trouble and recurs to from time to time, surely\r\nthe strangest ever given by a husband for instructing his wife. He is\r\nold, he says, and must die before her, and it is positively essential\r\nthat she should do him credit with her second husband. What a reflection\r\nupon him if she accompanied his successor to Mass with the collar of her\r\n_cotte_ crumpled, or if she knew not how to keep fleas from the\r\nblankets, or how to order a supper for twelve in Lent! It is\r\ncharacteristic of the Ménagier's reasonableness and solid sense that he\r\nregards his young wife's second marriage with equanimity. One of his\r\nsections is headed, 'That you should be loving to your husband (whether\r\nmyself or another), by the example of Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel.' How\r\ndifferent from those husbands (dog-in-the-manger, or anxious for the\r\nfuture of their children under a possibly harsh stepfather) whose wills\r\nso often reveal them trying to bind their wives to perpetual celibacy\r\nafter their deaths, such husbands as William, Earl of Pembroke, who died\r\nin 1469, admonishing his lady: 'And wyfe, ye remember your promise to me\r\nto take the ordere of wydowhood, as ye may be the better mastre of your\r\nowne to performe my wylle.'\r\n\r\nThe plan of the book 'in three sections, containing nineteen principal\r\narticles', is most exhaustive. The first section deals with religious\r\nand moral duties. In the words of the Ménagier, 'the first section is\r\nnecessary to gain for you the love of God and the salvation of your\r\nsoul, and also to win for you the love of your husband and to give you\r\nin this world that peace which ought to be had in marriage. And because\r\nthese two things, to wit the salvation of your soul and the comfort of\r\nyour husband, are the two things most chiefly necessary, therefore are\r\nthey here placed first.' Then follows a series of articles telling the\r\nlady how to say her morning prayer when she rises, how to bear herself\r\nat Mass, and in what form to make her confession to the priest, together\r\nwith a long and somewhat alarming discursus upon the seven deadly sins,\r\nwhich it assuredly never entered into her sleek little head to commit,\r\nand another, on the corresponding virtues.[2] But the greater part of\r\nthe section deals with the all-important subject of the wife's duty to\r\nher husband. She is to be loving, humble, obedient, careful and\r\nthoughtful for his person, silent regarding his secrets, and patient if\r\nhe be foolish and allow his heart to stray towards other women. The\r\nwhole section is illustrated by a series of stories (known as _exempla_\r\nin the Middle Ages), culled from the Bible, from the common stock of\r\nanecdotes possessed by jongleur and preacher alike, and (most\r\ninteresting of all) from the Ménagier's own experience. Among the\r\nMénagier's longer illustrations is the favourite but intolerably dull\r\nmoral tale of Melibeu and Prudence, by Albertano of Brescia, translated\r\ninto French by Renault de Louens, whose version the Ménagier copied, and\r\nadapted by Jean de Meung in the _Roman de la Rose_, from which in turn\r\nChaucer took it to tell to the Canterbury Pilgrims. Here also are to be\r\nfound Petrarch's famous tale of patient Griselda, which Chaucer also\r\ntook and gave a wider fame, and a long poem written in 1342 by Jean\r\nBruyant, a notary of the Châtelet at Paris, and called 'The Way of\r\nPoverty and Wealth', inculcating diligence and prudence.[3]\r\n\r\nThe second section of the book deals with household management and is\r\nfar the most interesting. The range of the Ménagier's knowledge leaves\r\nthe reader gasping. The man is a perfect Mrs Beeton! The section\r\ncomprises a detailed treatise on gardening and another on the principles\r\nwhich should govern the engagement of servants and the method by which\r\nthey should be managed when hired; the modern problem of servants who\r\nleave does not seem to have presented itself to him. There are\r\ninstructions how to mend, air, and clean dresses and furs, get out\r\ngrease spots, catch fleas and keep flies out of the bedroom, look after\r\nwine, and superintend the management of a farm.\r\n\r\nAt one point he breaks off, addressing his wife thus: 'Here will I leave\r\nyou to rest or to play and will speak no more to you; and while you\r\ndisport yourself elsewhere I will speak to Master John, the Steward, who\r\nlooks after our possessions, so that if there is anything wrong with any\r\nof our horses, whether for the plough or for riding, or if it is\r\nnecessary to buy or exchange a horse, he may know a little of that it\r\nbehoves him to know in this matter.' There follow several pages of wise\r\nadvice as to the good points of horses, how to examine them and to find\r\ntheir ages and defects under the eye of the horse dealer, the practical\r\n'tips' of a man who evidently knew and loved his horses, together with\r\nadvice upon the treatment of their various diseases. Among the various\r\nrecipes which the Ménagier gives to this intent are two charms; for\r\ninstance, 'when a horse has glanders, you must say to him these three\r\nwords, with three paternosters: _abgla_, _abgly_, _alphard_, _asy_,\r\n_pater noster_, etc.'[4]\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, there is a magnificent cookery book, arranged in\r\nthe form sacred to cookery books from that day to this, beginning with a\r\nlist of specimen menus for dinners and suppers, hot or cold, fast or\r\nfeast, summer or winter, giving hints on the choice of meat, poultry,\r\nand spices, and ending with a long series of recipes for all manner of\r\nsoups, stews, sauces, and other viands, with an excursus on\r\ninvalid's cookery!\r\n\r\nThe third section of the book was intended by the Ménagier to contain\r\nthree parts: first of all, a number of parlour games for indoor\r\namusement; secondly, a treatise on hawking, the favourite outdoor\r\namusement of ladies; and thirdly, a list of amusing riddles and games of\r\nan arithmetical kind ('concerning counting and numbering, subtle to find\r\nout or guess'), presumably of the nature of our old friend, 'If a\r\nherring and a half cost three ha'pence.' Unfortunately, the Ménagier\r\nseems never to have finished the book, and of this section only the\r\ntreatise on hawking has survived. It is a great pity, for we have\r\nseveral such treatises, and how interesting an account of indoor games\r\nand riddles might have been we may guess from a passage in the\r\nMénagier's version of the story of Lucrece, when he describes the Roman\r\nladies 'some gossiping, others playing at _bric_, others at _qui féry_,\r\nothers at _pince merille_, others at cards or other games of pleasure\r\nwith their neighbours; others, who had supped together, were singing\r\nsongs and telling fables and stories and wagers; others were in the\r\nstreet with their neighbours, playing at blind man's buff or at _bric_\r\nand at several other games of the kind.'[5] In those days, before the\r\ninvention of printing had made books plentiful, medieval ladies were\r\nlargely dependent for amusement upon telling and listening to stories,\r\nasking riddles, and playing games, which we have long ago banished to\r\nthe nursery; and a plentiful repertoire of such amusements was very\r\ndesirable in a hostess. The Ménagier was clearly anxious that his wife\r\nshould shine in the amenities as well as in the duties of social life.\r\n\r\nSuch was the monumental work which the Ménagier de Paris was able to\r\npresent to his awed but admiring wife; and though it has been sadly\r\nneglected by historians it deserves to be well known, for it gives us a\r\npicture of a medieval housewife which it would be hard indeed to\r\nsurpass. There is hardly a side of her daily life upon which it does not\r\ntouch, and we may now with advantage look more closely upon her, and see\r\nin turn the perfect lady, whose deportment and manners do credit to her\r\nbreeding; the perfect wife, whose submission to her husband is only\r\nequalled by her skill in ministering to his ease; the perfect mistress,\r\nwhose servants love her and run her house like clockwork; and the\r\nperfect housewife, the Mrs Beeton of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe Ménagier's views on deportment are incongruously sandwiched into his\r\nsection on spiritual duties, under the general headings of getting up in\r\nthe morning and going to church. His ideas on the subject of clothes are\r\nvery clearly defined: a sweet disorder in the dress was in no way to\r\nhis taste:\r\n\r\n     Know, dear sister, that if you wish to follow my advice you\r\n     will have great care and regard for what you and I can afford\r\n     to do, according to our estate. Have a care that you be\r\n     honestly clad, without new devices and without too much or\r\n     too little frippery. And before you leave your chamber and\r\n     house, take care first that the collar of your shift, and of\r\n     your _blanchet, cotte_ and _surcotte_, do not hang out one\r\n     over the other, as happens with certain drunken, foolish or\r\n     witless women, who have no care for their honour, nor for the\r\n     honesty of their estate or of their husbands, and who walk\r\n     with roving eyes and head horribly reared up like a lion (_la\r\n     teste espoventablement levée comme un lyon!_), their hair\r\n     straggling out of their wimples, and the collars of their\r\n     shifts and _cottes_ crumpled the one upon the other, and who\r\n     walk mannishly and bear themselves uncouthly before folk\r\n     without shame. And if one speaks to them about it, they\r\n     excuse themselves on the ground of their industry and\r\n     humility, saying that they are so diligent, hardworking, and\r\n     humble that they care not for themselves. But they lie; they\r\n     care so much for themselves that if they were in an\r\n     honourable company, never would they be willing that men\r\n     should wait less upon them than upon the wiser ladies of like\r\n     lineage with themselves, nor that they should have fewer\r\n     salutations, bows, reverences and speech than the rest, but\r\n     rather they desire more. And they are unworthy of it, for\r\n     they know not how to maintain their own honourable fame, nay,\r\n     nor the fame of their husbands and of their lineage, which\r\n     they bring to shame. Therefore, fair sister, have a care that\r\n     your hair, wimple, kerchief and hood and all the rest of your\r\n     attire be well arranged and decently ordered, that none who\r\n     see you can laugh or mock at you, but that all the others may\r\n     find in you an example of fair and simple and decent\r\n     array.... When you go to town or to church go suitably\r\n     accompanied by honourable women according to your estate, and\r\n     flee suspicious company, never allowing any ill famed woman\r\n     to be seen in your presence. And as you go bear your head\r\n     upright and your eyelids low and without fluttering, and look\r\n     straight in front of you about four rods ahead, without\r\n     looking round at any man or woman to the right or to the\r\n     left, nor looking up, nor glancing from place to place, nor\r\n     stopping to speak to anyone on the road.[6]\r\n\r\nSuch was the model of female deportment in the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nLet us pass from the lady to the wife. On the attitude of wife to\r\nhusband the Ménagier's ideas are much the same as those of the rest of\r\nhis age. They may be summed up as submission, obedience, and constant\r\nattention. She must be buxom at bed and at board, even in circumstances\r\nwhen buxomness hides a heavy heart. The good sense of the burgess does\r\nnot prevent him from likening the wife's love for her husband to the\r\nfidelity of domestic animals towards their masters: 'Of the domestic\r\nanimals you see how a greyhound, or a mastiff, or a little dog, whether\r\non the road, or at table, or in bed, always keeps near to the person\r\nfrom whom he takes his food, and leaves and is shy and fierce with all\r\nothers; and if the dog is afar off, he always has his heart and his eye\r\nupon his master; even if his master whip him and throw stones at him,\r\nthe dog follows, wagging his tail and lying down before his master,\r\nseeks to mollify him, and through rivers, through woods, through thieves\r\nand through battles follows him.... Wherefore for a better and stronger\r\nreason women, to whom God has given natural sense and who are\r\nreasonable, ought to have a perfect and solemn love for their husbands;\r\nand so I pray you to be very loving and privy with your husband who\r\nshall be.'[7] Patience is an essential quality in wives, and, however\r\nsorely tried they must never complain. The Ménagier tells three stories\r\nto illustrate how a wife should bear herself in order to win back the\r\nlove of an unfaithful husband. One of these is the famous tale of\r\nGriselda, but the two others are drawn (so he says) from his own\r\nexperience. In the first of these he tells of the wife of a famous\r\n_avocat_ in the _parlement_ of Paris, who saw to the nurture and\r\nmarriage of her husband's illegitimate daughter; 'nor did he ever\r\nperceive it by one reproach, or one angry or ugly word.' The second is\r\nthe charmingly told story of how John Quentin's wife won back her\r\nhusband's heart from the poor spinner of wool to whom it had strayed.[8]\r\nAll seem to show that the Ménagier's simile of the little dog was\r\nselected with care, for the medieval wife, like the dog, was expected to\r\nlick the hand that smote her. Nevertheless, while subscribing to all\r\nthe usual standards of his age, the Ménagier's robust sense, his hold\r\nupon the realities of life, kept him from pushing them too far. The\r\ncomment of another realist, Chaucer, on the tale of Patient Griselda\r\nwill be remembered.\r\n\r\n     Grisilde is deed and eek hire pacience,\r\n     And bothe at ones buryed in Ytaille;\r\n     For which I crie in open audience,\r\n     No wedded man so hardy be t'assaille\r\n     His wyves pacience in hope to fynde\r\n     Grisildes, for in certein he shal faille!\r\n\r\n     O noble wyves, ful of heigh prudence,\r\n     Lat noon humylitee youre tonge naill,\r\n     Ne lat no clerk have cause or diligence\r\n     To write of yow a stone of swich mervaille\r\n     As of Grisildis pacient and kynde,\r\n     Lest Chichivache[E] yow swelwe in hire entraille!...\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: Chichevache, the lean cow who fed on patient wives, while\r\nher mate Bicorne grew fat on humble husbands (A.W. Pollard).]\r\n\r\nHis creation of the Wife of Bath was an even more pointed commentary.\r\nHere is what the Ménagier has to say to his young wife on the\r\nsame subject:\r\n\r\nAnd I, who have put [the tale of Griselda] here only to teach you, have\r\nnot put it here to apply it to you, for I am not worthy thereof, and I am\r\nnot a marquis and I have not taken you as a beggar, nor am I so foolish,\r\nso conceited or so lacking in sense that I know not that 'tis not for me to\r\nassault nor to assay you thus, nor in like manner. God keep me from trying\r\nyou thus under colour of false simulations.... And forgive me that\r\nthe story speaks (in my opinion) of too great cruelty and beyond reason.\r\nAnd know that it never befel so, but thus the tale runs and I may nor\r\ncorrect nor alter it, for a wiser than I hath made it. And it is my desire\r\nthat since others have read it you also may know and be able to talk about\r\neverything even as other folk do.[9]\r\n\r\nMoreover, in spite of the ideal of submission which he sets before his\r\nwife, the Ménagier has some charming words to say about love--with a\r\nsigh, perhaps, for his own advanced though not crabbed age, and a\r\nglance at that younger husband of the future who shall one day enjoy his\r\nlittle bride.\r\n\r\nIn God's name (he says) I believe that when two good and honourable\r\npeople are wed, all other loves are put far off, destroyed and\r\nforgotten, save only the love of each for the other. And meseems that\r\nwhen they are in each other's presence, they look upon each other more\r\nthan upon the others, they clasp and hold each other and they do not\r\nwillingly speak or make sign save to each other. And when they are\r\nseparated, they think of each other and say in their hearts, 'When I see\r\nhim I shall do thus and thus to him, or say this to him, I shall beseech\r\nhim concerning this or that.' And all their special pleasure, their\r\nchief desire and their perfect joy is to do pleasure and obedience one\r\nto the other, if they love one another.[10]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the Ménagier's book is concerned, however, not with\r\nthe theoretical niceties of wifely submission, but with his creature\r\ncomforts. His instructions as to how to make a husband comfortable\r\npositively palpitate with life; and at the same time there is something\r\nindescribably homely and touching about them; they tell more about the\r\nreal life of a burgess's wife than a hundred tales of Patient Griselda\r\nor of Jehanne la Quentine. Consider this picture (how typical a product\r\nof the masculine imagination!) of the stout bread-winner, buffeted about\r\nin all weathers and amid all discomforts, nobly pursuing the task of\r\nearning his living, and fortified by the recollection of a domesticated\r\nlittle wife, darning his stockings at home by the fire, and prepared to\r\nlavish her attentions on the weary hero in the evening. The passage is\r\nan excellent example of the Ménagier's vivid and simple style, and of\r\nthe use of incidents drawn from everyday life to illustrate his thesis,\r\nwhich is one of the chief charms of the book.\r\n\r\n     Fair sister, if you have another husband after me, know that\r\n     you should think much of his comfort, for after a woman has\r\n     lost her first husband she commonly finds it difficult to\r\n     find another according to her estate, and she remains lonely\r\n     and disconsolate for a long time[F]; and more so still, if\r\n     she lose the second. Wherefore cherish the person of your\r\n     husband carefully, and, I pray you, keep him in clean linen,\r\n     for 'tis your business. And because the care of outside\r\n     affairs lieth with men, so must a husband take heed, and go\r\n     and come and journey hither and thither, in rain and wind,\r\n     in snow and hail, now drenched, now dry, now sweating, now\r\n     shivering, ill-fed, ill-lodged, ill-warmed and ill-bedded;\r\n     and nothing harms him, because he is upheld by the hope that\r\n     he has of his wife's care of him on his return, and of the\r\n     ease, the joys and the pleasures which she will do to him, or\r\n     cause to be done to him in her presence; to have his shoes\r\n     removed before a good fire, his feet washed and to have fresh\r\n     shoes and stockings, to be given good food and drink, to be\r\n     well served and well looked after, well bedded in white\r\n     sheets and night-caps, well covered with good furs, and\r\n     assuaged with other joys and amusements, privities, loves,\r\n     and secrets, concerning which I am silent; and on the next\r\n     day fresh shirts and garments. Certes, fair sister, such\r\n     service maketh a man love and desire to return to his home\r\n     and to see his goodwife and to be distant with other women.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote F: This seems to be contrary to experience.]\r\n\r\n     And therefore I counsel you to make such cheer to your\r\n     husband at all his comings and goings and to persevere\r\n     therein; and also to be peaceable with him and remember the\r\n     rustic proverb, which saith that there be three things which\r\n     drive the goodman from home, to wit, a dripping roof, a\r\n     smoking chimney and a scolding woman.[11] Wherefore, fair\r\n     sister, I pray you that in order to keep yourself in love and\r\n     good favour with your husband you be unto him gentle, amiable\r\n     and debonair. Do unto him what the good simple women of our\r\n     country say has been done unto their sons, when the lads have\r\n     set their love elsewhere and their mothers cannot wean them\r\n     from it. It is certain that when fathers and mothers be dead,\r\n     and stepfathers and stepmothers argue with their stepsons,\r\n     and scold them and repulse them, and take not thought for\r\n     their sleeping, nor for their food and drink, their hose and\r\n     their shirts and all their other needs and affairs, and the\r\n     same children find elsewhere a good home and good counsel\r\n     from some other woman, who receives them and takes thought to\r\n     warm them with some poor gruel with her and to give them a\r\n     bed and keep them tidy, mending their hosen, breeches,\r\n     shirts, and other garments, then those lads cleave to her and\r\n     desire to be with her, and to sleep warm between her breasts,\r\n     and are altogether estranged from their mothers and fathers,\r\n     who before took no heed of them, and now want to get them\r\n     back and have them again. But it may not be, for these\r\n     children hold more dear the company of strangers, who think\r\n     and care for them, than that of their kinsfolk, who have no\r\n     care of them. Then the parents lament and weep and say that\r\n     these same women have bewitched their children and that they\r\n     are spellbound and cannot leave, but are never easy save when\r\n     they are with their enchantresses. But whatever may be said\r\n     of it, it is no witchcraft, but it by reason of the love, the\r\n     care, the intimacies, joys and pleasures, which these women\r\n     do in all ways unto the lads, and on my soul there is no\r\n     other enchantment.... Wherefore, dear sister, I pray you thus\r\n     to bewitch and bewitch again your husband, and beware of\r\n     dripping roof and smoking fire, and scold him not, but be\r\n     unto him gentle and amiable and peaceable. Be careful that in\r\n     winter he has good fire without smoke, and let him rest well\r\n     and be well covered between your breasts and thus bewitch\r\n     him.... And thus you shall preserve and guard him from all\r\n     discomforts and give him all the ease that you can, and serve\r\n     him and cause him to be well served in your house; and you\r\n     shall look to him for outside things, for if he be a good man\r\n     he will take even more care and trouble over them than you\r\n     wish, and by doing as I have said, you will make him always\r\n     miss you and have his heart with you and with your loving\r\n     service, and he will shun all other houses, all other women,\r\n     all other services and households; all will be naught to him\r\n     save you alone, if you think of him as aforesaid.... And so\r\n     on the road, husbands will think of their wives, and no\r\n     trouble will be a burden to them for the hope and love they\r\n     will have of their wives, whom they will long to see, even as\r\n     poor hermits, penitents and fasting monks long to see the\r\n     face of Christ Jesus; and husbands served thus will never\r\n     desire to abide elsewhere or in other company but will\r\n     withhold, withdraw and abstain themselves there-from; all the\r\n     rest will seem to them but a bed of stones compared with\r\n     their home.[12]\r\n\r\nEnough has perhaps been quoted to show the Ménagier's idea of a perfect\r\nwife; his idea of the perfect housewife is contained in a mass of\r\ninstructions which make excellently entertaining reading. So modern in\r\ntone is his section on the management of servants, both in his account\r\nof their ways and in his advice upon dealing with them, that one often\r\nrubs one's eyes to be sure that what one is reading is really a book\r\nwritten over five centuries ago by an old burgess of Paris. The Ménagier\r\nevidently had a fairly large household, and he probably owned a country\r\nas well as a town house, for he speaks several times of overseeing the\r\nfarm-hands 'when you are in the village'. To assist his wife in\r\nsuperintending this large staff he has a _maître d'hôtel_, called Master\r\nJohn the Steward (_le despensier_) and a duenna, half housekeeper and\r\nhalf chaperon, for her young mistress, called Dame Agnes _la béguine_[G]\r\nand a bailiff or foreman to look after the farm. The Ménagier divides\r\nhis servants and workmen into three classes--first, those engaged by the\r\nday or by the season for special work, such as porters and carriers,\r\nreapers, winnowers, coopers, and so on; secondly, those engaged on\r\npiecework, such as tailors, furriers, bakers, and shoemakers, hired by\r\nmedieval households of some wealth to make what was needed from raw\r\nmaterial purchased at fairs or in the shops of the city; and thirdly,\r\nthe ordinary domestic servants, who were hired by the year and lived in\r\ntheir master's house; 'and of all these,' he says, 'there is none who\r\ndoes not gladly seek work and a master'.\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: The Béguines were a sort of religious order, or, more\r\ncorrectly, a lay sisterhood, standing half-way between the lay and the\r\nmonastic life, and somewhat analogous to the Franciscan Tertiaries, or\r\nThird Order.]\r\n\r\nHe gives an amusing account, evidently based upon bitter experience, of\r\nthe wiles of the hired workman. He says that they are commonly lazy,\r\nrough, quick at 'answering back', arrogant (except on payday) and ready\r\nto break into insults if unsatisfied with their pay. He warns his wife\r\nto bid Master John always to take the peaceable ones and always to\r\nbargain with them beforehand as to the pay for which they will do\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\n     For know that most often they do not want to bargain, but\r\n     they want to get to work without any bargain having been made\r\n     and they say gently, 'Milord, it is nothing--there is no\r\n     need--you will pay me well and I shall be content with what\r\n     you think fit.' And if Master John take them thus, when the\r\n     work is finished they will say, 'Sir, there was more to do\r\n     than I thought, there was this and that to do, and here and\r\n     there,' and they will not take what is given them and will\r\n     break out into shouting and angry words ... and will spread\r\n     abroad evil report concerning you, which is worst of all.[13]\r\n\r\nWe know from the various ordinances fixing wages from the time of the\r\nBlack Death onwards, that labour troubles were acute in France as well\r\nas in England at the end of the fourteenth century; and the Ménagier's\r\nadvice throws an interesting sidelight on the situation.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in his observations upon the engagement and management\r\nof maidservants that the wisdom of the serpent is most apparent.\r\nIncidentally he gives an account of how servants were hired in\r\nfourteenth-century Paris, which shows that the registry office\r\nand the character are by no means modern phenomena. There were\r\n_recommanderesses_--women holding what we should call registry\r\noffices--in Paris at this time, and an ordinance of 1351 (fixing wages\r\nafter the Black Death) allows them to take _1s. 6d_. for placing a\r\nchambermaid and _2s_. for a nurse. A servant maid's wage at this time\r\nwas 30s. a year and her shoes. The Ménagier counsels his wife thus on\r\nthe delicate subject of interviewing and engaging her domestic\r\nchambermaids and serving men:\r\n\r\n     Know, dear sister (he says), that in order that they may obey\r\n     you better and fear the more to anger you, I leave you the\r\n     rule and authority to have them chosen by Dame Agnes the\r\n     béguine, or by whichever other of your women you please, to\r\n     receive them into our service, to hire them at your pleasure,\r\n     to pay and keep them in our service as you please, and to\r\n     dismiss them when you will. Nathless you should privily speak\r\n     to me about it and act according to my advice, because you\r\n     are too young and might be deceived by your own people. And\r\n     know that of those chambermaids who are out of a place, many\r\n     there be who offer themselves and clamour and seek urgently\r\n     for masters and mistresses; and of these take none until you\r\n     first know where their last place was, and send some of your\r\n     people to get their character, to wit whether they talked or\r\n     drank too much, how long they were in the place, what work\r\n     they have been accustomed to doing and can do, whether they\r\n     have homes or friends in the town, from what sort of people\r\n     and what part of the country they come, how long they were\r\n     there and why they left; and by their work in the past you\r\n     shall find out what hope or expectation you may have of their\r\n     work in the future. And know that oft-times such women from\r\n     distant parts of the country have been blamed for some fault\r\n     in their own part of the world and that is what brings them\r\n     into service at a distance....\r\n\r\n     And if you find from the report of her master and mistress,\r\n     neighbours and others that a girl is what you need, find out\r\n     from her, and cause Master John to register in his account\r\n     book, the day on which you engage her, her name and those of\r\n     her father, mother and any of her kinsfolk, the place where\r\n     they live and her birthplace and her references. For servants\r\n     will be more afraid to do wrong if they know that you are\r\n     recording all these things and that if they leave you without\r\n     permission, or are guilty of any offence, you will write and\r\n     complain to the justice of their country or to their friends.\r\n     And not withstanding bear in mind the saying of the\r\n     philosopher called Bertrand the Old, who says that if you\r\n     engage a maid or man of high and proud answers, you shall\r\n     know that when she leaves she will miscall you if she can;\r\n     and if, on the contrary, she be flattering and ¸full of\r\n     blandishments, trust her not, for she is in league with\r\n     someone else to trick you; but if she blushes and is silent\r\n     and shamefast when you correct her, love her as your\r\n     daughter.[14]\r\n\r\nThe Ménagier's instructions as to how to look after servants when they\r\nhave been engaged are equally practical. Good order is to be maintained,\r\nquarrels and bad language[15] prevented, and morals guarded. Each is to\r\nhave his or her work assigned and to do it promptly. 'If you order them\r\nto do something now and these your servants answer \"There is plenty of\r\ntime, it shall be done,\" or \"It shall be done tomorrow,\" hold it as\r\nforgotten, it must all be begun again, it is as nought. And also when\r\nyou give a general order to every one, each will wait for the other to\r\ndo it, and it is the same.' Not only is the work of the servants to be\r\ncarefully superintended by the mistress and by Dame Agnes, 'who is with\r\nyou', the Ménagier tells his wife, 'in order to teach you wise and ripe\r\nbehaviour and to serve and instruct you and to whom in particular I give\r\nthe charge of this matter', but she is to show herself careful and\r\nbenevolent in looking after their health and happiness. At the proper\r\nhour she is to cause them to sit down before a hearty meal of one sort\r\nof meat, avoiding rich viands, and one kind of drink, which must be\r\nnourishing but not intoxicating--'the cup that cheers but not\r\ninebriates'; probably in this case the light ale which was the habitual\r\ndrink of the Middle Ages. She is to admonish them to eat and drink\r\ntheir fill, but\r\n\r\n     as soon as they begin to tell stories, or to argue, or to\r\n     lean on their elbows, order the béguine to make them rise and\r\n     take away their table, for the common folk have a saying\r\n     'when a varlet holds forth at table and a horse grazes in the\r\n     ditch, it is time to take them away, for they have had\r\n     their fill.'\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after their afternoon's work, they are to have another\r\nhearty meal, and then in winter time they may warm themselves at the\r\nfire and take their ease. Then she is to lock up the house and pack them\r\nall off to bed.\r\n\r\n     And arrange first that each have beside his bed a candlestick\r\n     in which to put his candle, and have them wisely taught to\r\n     extinguish it with the mouth or hand before getting into bed\r\n     and by no means with their shirts. And also have them\r\n     admonished and taught each and all, that they must begin\r\n     again the next day and that they must rise in the morning and\r\n     each set to upon his own work.\r\n\r\nThe Ménagier further advises his wife that chambermaids of fifteen to\r\ntwenty years of age are foolish girls who do not know the world, and\r\nthat she should always cause them to sleep near her in an antechamber,\r\nor a room without a skylight or a low window looking on to the street,\r\nand should make them get up and go to bed at the same time as herself.\r\n'And you yourself,' he adds, 'who, if God please, will be wise by this\r\ntime, must keep them near to you.' Moreover, if any of her servants fall\r\nill, 'do you yourself, laying aside all other cares, very lovingly and\r\ncharitably care for him or her, and visit him and study diligently how\r\nto bring about his cure'.[16]\r\n\r\nBut it is perhaps in his capacity as Mrs Beeton that the Ménagier is\r\nmost amusing. His infinite variety of household knowledge is shown in\r\nthe incidental recipes which he gives when he is describing the measures\r\nwhich a wife must take for her lord's comfort, and the work of the\r\nservants. There are elaborate instructions concerning the costly\r\nmedieval garments, worn year after year for a lifetime and often\r\nbequeathed in their owner's will, instructions for cleaning dresses and\r\nfurs and for preserving them from moths, and instructions for removing\r\nstains and grease spots. The Ménagier gives seven recipes for taking out\r\ngrease spots, but he is rather sceptical about one or two of them, which\r\nhe has evidently copied from a book without trying them for himself. 'To\r\nget rid of stains on a dress of silk, satin, camlet, damask cloth or\r\nanother,' runs one of these, 'dip and wash the stain in verjuice and the\r\nstain will go; even if the dress be faded, it will regain its colour.\r\n_This I do not believe'_. The chief impression left, however, is that\r\nthe medieval housewife was engaged in a constant warfare against fleas.\r\nOne of the Ménagier's infallible rules for keeping a husband happy at\r\nhome is to give him a good fire in the winter and keep his bed free from\r\nfleas in the summer. He gives six recipes for getting rid of such small\r\nlivestock, which must indeed have been a very common trial to our\r\nforefathers:\r\n\r\nIn summer take heed that there be no fleas in your chamber nor in your\r\nbed, which you may do in six ways, as I have heard tell. For I have\r\nheard from several persons that if the room be scattered with alder\r\nleaves the fleas will get caught therein. Item, I have heard tell that\r\nif you have at night one or two trenchers of bread covered with birdlime\r\nor turpentine and put about the room with a lighted candle set in the\r\nmidst of each trencher, they will come and get stuck thereto. Another\r\nway which I have found and which is true: take a rough cloth and spread\r\nit about your room and over your bed and all the fleas who may hop on to\r\nit will be caught, so that you can carry them out with the cloth\r\nwheresoever you will. Item, sheepskins. Item, I have seen blankets\r\nplaced on the straw and on the bed and when the black fleas jumped upon\r\nthem they were the sooner found and killed upon the white. But the best\r\nway is to guard oneself against those which are within the coverlets and\r\nfurs and the stuff of the dresses wherewith one is covered. For know\r\nthat I have tried this, and when the coverlets, furs or dresses in which\r\nthere be fleas are folded and shut tightly up, in a chest straitly bound\r\nwith straps or in a bag well tied up and pressed, or otherwise\r\ncompressed so that the said fleas are without light and air and kept\r\nimprisoned, then they will perish and die at once.[17]\r\n\r\nA similar war had also to be waged against flies and mosquitoes, which\r\nrendered summer miserable. \"I have sometimes,\" says the Ménagier, \"seen\r\nin several chambers that when one has gone to bed in them, they were\r\nfull of mosquitoes, which at the smoke of the breath came to sit on the\r\nfaces of those who slept and sting them so that they were fain to get up\r\nand light a fire of hay to smoke them off.\" Against such pests he has\r\nalso six infallible recipes--to wit, a mosquito net over the bed; sprigs\r\nof fern hung up for the flies to settle on; a bowl filled with a mixture\r\nof milk and hare's gall, or with the juice of raw onions, which will\r\nkill them; a bottle containing a rag dipped in honey, or else a string\r\ndipped in honey to hang up; fly whisks to drive them away; and closing\r\nup windows with oiled cloth or parchment.[18]\r\n\r\nThe section on cookery, which contains the Ménagier's injunctions for\r\n\"feeding the brute\", is the longest in the book, and gives an\r\nextraordinarily interesting picture of the domestic economy of our\r\nancestors.[19] The Ménagier must have been brother to Chaucer's\r\nFranklin, 'Epicurus owene sone':\r\n\r\nAn housholdere, and that a greet, was he:\r\nSeint Julian he was in his contree;\r\nHis breed, his ale, was alwey after oon;\r\nA bettre envyned man was nowher noon.\r\nWithoute bake mete was never his hous,\r\nOf fissh and flessh, and that so plenteuous\r\nIt snewed in his hous of mete and drynke.\r\nOf alle deyntees that men koude thynke.\r\nAfter the sondry sesons of the yeer,\r\nSo chaunged he his mete and his soper.\r\nFul many a fat partrich had he in muwe\r\nAnd many a breem and many a luce in stuwe.\r\nWo was his cook but if his sauce were\r\nPoynaunt and sharpe and redy al his geere.\r\nHis table dormant in his hal alway\r\nStood redy covered al the longe day.\r\n\r\nIn this, as in all other medieval cookery books, what strikes the modern\r\nreader is the length and elaboration of the huge feasts, with their many\r\ncourses and dishes, and the richness of the highly spiced viands. There\r\nare black puddings and sausages, venison and beef, eels and herrings,\r\nfresh water fish, round sea fish and flat sea fish, common pottages\r\nunspiced, spiced pottages, meat pottages and meatless pottages, roasts\r\nand pastries and entremets, divers sauces boiled and unboiled, pottages\r\nand 'slops' for invalids. Some of them sound delicious, others would be\r\nruin to our degenerate digestions today. Pungent sauces of vinegar,\r\nverjuice, and wine were very much favoured, and cloves, cinnamon,\r\ngalingale, pepper, and ginger appear unexpectedly in meat dishes.\r\nAlmonds were a favourite ingredient in all sorts of dishes, as they\r\nstill are in China and other parts of the East, and they might well be\r\nused more lavishly than they are in modern European cookery. True to his\r\nrace, the Ménagier includes recipes for cooking frogs and snails.[20] To\r\nthe modern cook some of his directions may appear somewhat vague, as\r\nwhen he bids his cook to boil something for as long as it takes to say a\r\npaternoster or a _miserere_; yet for clockless kitchens in a pious age\r\nwhat clearer indication could a man give? And, after all, it is no worse\r\nthan 'cook in a hot oven', which still finds a place in many modern\r\ncookery books which should know better. Other instructions are detailed\r\nenough. In one valuable passage he gives a list of all the meat markets\r\nof Paris, together with the number of butchers to be found in each and\r\nthe number of sheep, oxen, pigs, and calves sold there every week,\r\nadding also for interest the amount of meat and poultry consumed weekly\r\nin the households of the King, the Queen and the royal children, the\r\nDukes of Orleans, Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon. Elsewhere also he speaks\r\nof other markets--the Pierre-au-Lait, or milk market; the Place de\r\nGrève, where they sell coal and firewood; and the Porte-de-Paris which\r\nis not only a meat market, but the best place in which to buy fish and\r\nsalt and green herbs and branches to adorn your rooms.\r\n\r\nFor his wife's further guidance the Ménagier sets out a careful\r\nspecification of the catering arrangements for several great feasts--to\r\nwit, a dinner given by the Abbot of Lagny to the Bishop of Paris and the\r\nmembers of the King's Council, the feast, comprising dinner and supper,\r\nwhich one Master Elias (evidently a grave and reverend _maître d'hôtel,_\r\nlike Master John _le despensier_ himself) made for the wedding of Jean\r\ndu Chesne, upon a Tuesday in May, and the arrangements for another\r\nwedding, \"les nopces Hautecourt\", in the month of September, as to which\r\nthe Ménagier observes \"that because they were widower and widow they\r\nwere wed very early, in their black robes and then put on others\"; he\r\nwas anxious that his widow should do the correct thing at that second\r\nwedding of hers. The description of the wedding feast arranged by Master\r\nElias is particularly detailed and valuable.[21] The careful Ménagier,\r\nperhaps because he foresaw some big entertainment which he must give to\r\nthe burgesses and gentlemen of Paris, perhaps because of his delightful\r\ninterest in all the details of material life, has set down at length not\r\nonly the menu of the dinner and supper, but a long account of the\r\ningredients needed, their quantities and prices, and the shops or\r\nmarkets where they must be bought, so that the reader can see with his\r\neyes the _maître d'hôtel_ and the cooks going round from stall to stall,\r\nvisiting butcher and baker, poulterer, saucemaker, vintner, wafer maker,\r\nwho sold the wafers and pastries dear to medieval ladies, and spicer\r\nwhose shop was heavy with the scents of the East.\r\n\r\nThe Ménagier sets down also all the esquires and varlets and waiters\r\nwho will be needed to serve such a feast as this. There was the master\r\ncook, comfortably stout and walking 'high and disposedly', as Queen\r\nElizabeth danced, brain pan stuffed full of delectable recipes, hand of\r\nravishing lightness with pastries, eye and nose skilled to say when a\r\ncapon was done to a turn, warranted without a rival\r\n\r\nTo boille the chiknes with the marybones,\r\nAnd poudre-marchant tart and galyngale ...\r\nHe koude rooste and seethe and boille and frye,\r\nMaken martreux and wel bake a pye ...\r\nFor blankmanger, that made he with the beste.\r\n\r\nHe brought his varlets with him, and in Paris he took two francs for his\r\nhire 'and perquisites' (a pregnant addition). Then there were ushers,\r\n'stout and strong', to keep the doors, and a clerk to add up the\r\naccount; bread-cutters and water-carriers, two squires to serve at the\r\ndresser in the kitchen where the plates and dishes were handed out, two\r\nothers at the hall dresser to give out spoons and drinking cups and pour\r\nwine for the guests, and two others in the pantry to give out the wine\r\nwhich their varlet kept drawing for them. There were the two _maîtres\r\nd'hôtel_ to set out the silver salt-cellars for the high table, the four\r\ngreat gilded goblets, the four dozen hanaps, the four dozen silver\r\nspoons, the ewers and alms mugs and sweetmeat dishes, and to usher the\r\nguests to their places; a head waiter and two servitors for each table,\r\na flower girl to make chaplets of flowers for the guests, women to see\r\nto the linen and deck the bridal bed,[22] and a washerwoman. The floors\r\nwere strewn with violets and green herbs and the rooms decked with\r\nbranches of May (all bought in the market in early morning), and there\r\nwas a good stock of torches and candles, small candles to stand on the\r\nsupper tables, and great torches to be set in sconces on the walls, or\r\nto be carried in procession by the guests, for the supper ended with\r\n'dancing, singing, wine and spices and lighted torches'. On this\r\noccasion eight francs were given to the minstrels, over and above the\r\nspoons and other presents made to them during the meal, and there were\r\nalso acrobats and mimes to amuse the guests. If they had to prepare a\r\ngreat feast Master John and his little mistress could not go far wrong\r\nafter this, or fail to please the genial epicure who set it down for\r\nthem. The Ménagier copied many of his recipes from other cookery books,\r\nbut he must have got the details of this entertainment from Master Elias\r\nhimself, and one can see their grey heads wagging with enjoyment, as one\r\ntalked and the other wrote.\r\n\r\nThe cookery book ends with a section containing recipes for making what\r\nthe Ménagier calls 'small things which are not necessities'. There are\r\nvarious sorts of jams, mostly made with honey; in the Middle Ages\r\nvegetables were evidently much prepared in this way, for the Ménagier\r\nspeaks of turnip, carrot, and pumpkin jam. There is a delicious syrup of\r\nmixed spices (at least the palate of faith must believe it to have been\r\ndelicious) and a powder of ginger, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, and\r\nsugar, to be sifted over food, as sugar is sifted today; there is a\r\nrecipe for hippocras, and for 'gauffres' or wafers, and for candied\r\noranges. There are various sage pieces of advice as to the seasons for\r\ncertain foods and the best ways of cooking and serving them. Most\r\namusing of all these are a number of recipes not of a culinary\r\nnature--to wit, for making glue and marking ink, for bringing up small\r\nbirds in aviaries and cages, preparing sand for hour-glasses, making\r\nrose-water, drying roses to lay among dresses (as we lay lavender\r\ntoday), for curing tooth-ache, and for curing the bite of a mad dog. The\r\nlatter is a charm, of the same type as the Ménagier's horse charms:\r\n'Take a crust of bread and write what follows: _Bestera bestie nay\r\nbrigonay dictera sagragan es domina siat siat siat_.' Let us remember,\r\nhowever, that the nation which produced it, some four centuries later,\r\nproduced Pasteur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V. THE MÉNAGIER'S WIFE HAS A GARDEN PARTY]\r\n\r\nEnough has been said about this entrancing book to show how vividly it\r\nbrings not only the Ménagier, but the Ménagier's young wife before our\r\neyes after these many years. In the morning she rises, much earlier than\r\nladies rise nowadays, though not so early as nuns, who must say matins,\r\nfor that, her husband tells her, is not a fitting hour for married women\r\nto leave their beds. Then she washes, much less than ladies nowadays,\r\nhands and face only perchance, and says her orisons, and dresses very\r\nneatly, for she knows whose eye is upon her, and so goes with Dame Agnes\r\nthe béguine to Mass, with eyes on the ground and hands folded over\r\nher painted primer. After Mass, and perhaps confession, back again to\r\nsee if the servants are doing their work, and have swept and dusted the\r\nhall and the rooms, beaten the cushions and coverlets on the forms and\r\ntidied everything, and afterwards to interview Master John the steward\r\nand order dinner and supper. Then she sends Dame Agnes to see to the pet\r\ndogs and birds, \"for they cannot speak and so you must speak and think\r\nfor them if you have any\". Then, if she be in her country house, she\r\nmust take thought for the farm animals and Dame Agnes must superintend\r\nthose who have charge of them, Robin the shepherd, Josson the oxherd,\r\nArnoul the cowherd, Jehanneton the milkmaid, and Eudeline the farmer's\r\nwife who looks after the poultry yard. If she be in her town house she\r\nand her maids take out her dresses and furs from their great chests and\r\nspread them in the sun in the garden or courtyard to air, beating them\r\nwith little rods, shaking them in the breeze, taking out spots and\r\nstains with one or other of the master's tried recipes, pouncing with\r\nlynx eyes upon the moth or sprightly flea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VI. THE MÉNAGIER'S WIFE COOKS HIS SUPPER, WITH THE AID OF\r\nHIS BOOK]\r\n\r\nAfter this comes dinner, the serious meal of the day, eaten by our\r\nancestors about 10 a.m. What the Ménagier's wife gives to her lord and\r\nmaster will depend upon the time of year and upon whether it be a meat\r\nor a fast day; but we know that she has no lack of menus from which to\r\nchoose. After dinner she sees that the servants are set to dine, and\r\nthen the busy housewife may become the lady of leisure and amuse\r\nherself. If in the country she may ride out hawking with a gay party of\r\nneighbours; if in town, on a winter's day, she may romp and play with\r\nother married ladies of her tender years, exchange riddles or tell\r\nstories round the fire. But what she most loves is to wander in her\r\ngarden, weaving herself garlands of flowers, violets, gilly flowers,\r\nroses, thyme, or rosemary, gathering fruit in season (she likes\r\nraspberries and cherries), and passing on to the gardeners weighty\r\nadvice about the planting of pumpkins (\"in April water them courteously\r\nand transplant them\"), to which the gardeners give as much attention as\r\ngardeners always have given, give still, and ever shall give, world\r\nwithout end, to the wishes of their employers. When she tires of this,\r\nthe busy one gathers together Dame Agnes and her maids, and they sit\r\nunder the carved beams of the hall mending his mastership's doublet,\r\nembroidering a vestment for the priest at his family chantry, or a\r\ntapestry hanging for the bedchamber. Or perhaps they simply spin (since,\r\nin the words of the Wife of Bath, God has given women three\r\ntalents--deceit, weeping, and spinning!); and all the while she awes\r\nthem with that tale of Griselda, her voice rising and falling to the\r\nsteady hum of the wheels.\r\n\r\nAt last it is evening, and back comes the lord and master. What a bustle\r\nand a pother this home-coming meant we know well, since we know what he\r\nexpected. Such a running and fetching of bowls of warm water to wash his\r\nfeet, and comfortable shoes to ease him; such a hanging on his words and\r\nadmiring of his labours. Then comes supper, with a bevy of guests, or\r\nthemselves all alone in the westering sunlight, while he smacks\r\nconnoisseur's lips over the roast crane and the blankmanger, and she\r\nnibbles her sweet wafers. Afterwards an hour of twilight, when she tells\r\nhim how she has passed the day, and asks him what she shall do with the\r\nsilly young housemaid, whom she caught talking to the tailor's 'prentice\r\nthrough that low window which looks upon the road. There is warm\r\naffection in the look she turns up to him, her round little face\r\npuckered with anxiety over the housemaid, dimpling into a smile when he\r\ncommends her; and there is warm affection and pride too in the look the\r\nold man turns down upon her. So the night falls, and they go round the\r\nhouse together, locking all the doors and seeing that the servants are\r\nsafe abed, for our ancestors were more sparing of candlelight than we.\r\nAnd so to bed.\r\n\r\nWe may take our leave of the couple here. The Ménagier's wife evidently\r\nhad a full life.\r\n\r\nSome respit to husbands the weather may send,\r\nBut huswiues affaires haue neuer an end.\r\n\r\nThere was no room in it for the idleness of those lovely ladies, with\r\ntheir long fingers, whom Langland admonished to sew for the poor.\r\nMoreover, exaggerated as some of her husband's ideas upon wifely\r\nsubmission appear today, the book leaves a strong impression of good\r\nsense and of respect as well as love for her. The Ménagier does not want\r\nhis wife to be on a pedestal, like the troubadour's lady, nor licking\r\nhis shoes like Griselda; he wants a helpmeet, for, as Chaucer said, 'If\r\nthat wommen were nat goode and hir conseils goode and profitable, oure\r\nLord God of hevene wolde never han wroght hem, ne called hem \"help\" of\r\nman, but rather confusioun of man.'[23] Ecclesiastical Jeremiahs were\r\noften wont to use the characteristically medieval argument that if God\r\nhad meant woman for a position of superiority He would have taken her\r\nfrom Adam's head rather than his side; but the Ménagier would have\r\nagreed with the more logical Peter Lombard, who observed that she was\r\nnot taken from Adam's head, because she was not intended to be his\r\nruler, nor from his feet either, because she was not intended to be his\r\nslave, but from his side, precisely, because she was intended to be his\r\ncompanion. There is something of this spirit in the Ménagier's attitude\r\ntowards his little wife, and it is this which makes his book so charming\r\nand causes it to stand head and shoulders above most other medieval\r\nbooks of behaviour for women. But, above all, its social and historical\r\nvalue lies in the fact that it gives us, in hues undimmed by time, a\r\nfull length portrait of a medieval housewife, who has her place (and it\r\nis a large one) in history, but concerning whom historians have almost\r\ninvariably been silent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_Thomas Betson_\r\n\r\nA MERCHANT OF THE STAPLE IN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n     Some men of noble stock were made, some glory in the murder blade:\r\n     Some praise a Science or an Art, but I like honourable Trade!\r\n\r\n          --JAMES ELROY FLECKER\r\n\r\n               _The Golden Journey to Samarcand_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visitor to the House of Lords, looking respectfully upon that august\r\nassembly, cannot fail to be struck by a stout and ungainly object facing\r\nthe throne--an ungainly object upon which in full session of Parliament,\r\nhe will observe seated the Lord Chancellor of England. The object is a\r\nwoolsack, and it is stuffed as full of pure history as the office of\r\nLord Chancellor itself. For it reminds a cotton-spinning, iron-working\r\ngeneration that the greatness of England was built up, not upon the\r\nflimsy plant which comes to her to be manufactured from the Far East and\r\nWest of the world, nor upon the harsh metal delved from her bowels, but\r\nupon the wool which generation after generation has grown on the backs\r\nof her black-faced sheep. First in the form of a raw material sought\r\nafter eagerly by all the cloth-makers of Europe, then in the form of a\r\nmanufacture carried on in her own towns and villages, and sent out far\r\nand wide in ships, wool was the foundation of England's greatness right\r\nup to the time of the Industrial Revolution, when cotton and iron took\r\nits place. So if you look at old pictures of the House of Lords, in\r\nHenry VIII's reign, or in Elizabeth's, you will see the woolsack before\r\nthe throne,[1] as you will see it if you visit the House today. The Lord\r\nChancellor of England is seated upon a woolsack because it was upon a\r\nwoolsack that this fair land rose to prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable body of traders in England during the Middle Ages\r\nwere the Merchants of the Staple, who traded in wool. The wool trade had\r\nfor long been the largest and most lucrative body of trade in the\r\ncountry, and it was one in which the Kings of England were particularly\r\ninterested, for their customs revenue was drawn largely from wool and\r\nwool fells; and, moreover, when they desired to borrow money in\r\nanticipation of revenue it was to the wool merchants that they turned,\r\nbecause the wool merchants were the wealthiest traders in the country.\r\nFor these and other reasons the Government adopted the custom of fixing\r\nstaple towns, which acted as centres of distribution through which the\r\nexport trade was forced to go. The location of the Staple was altered\r\nfrom time to time; sometimes it was at Bruges, sometimes at Antwerp,\r\nsometimes in England; but usually it was at Calais, where it was first\r\nfixed in 1363 and finally established in 1423. Through the Staple all\r\nwool and wool fells, hides, leather, and tin had to pass, and the\r\norganization of the system was complete when the body of wool merchants,\r\nin whose hands lay the bulk of the Staple trade, were finally\r\nincorporated in 1354, under the governance of a mayor. The system was a\r\nconvenient one for Crown and merchants alike. The Crown could\r\nconcentrate its customs officers in one place and collect its customs\r\nthe more easily, particularly as a method was gradually developed by\r\nwhich the custom and subsidy on wool was paid to the Royal officials by\r\nthe Fellowship of the Staple, who then collected it from the individual\r\nmembers. The merchants, on the other hand, benefited by the\r\nconcentration in trade: they were able to travel in groups and to\r\norganize convoys to protect the wool fleets from pirates who swarmed in\r\nthe narrow seas between England and France; as members of a powerful\r\ncorporation they could secure both privileges and protection in\r\nFlanders. Moreover, the wool buyers also benefited by the arrangement,\r\nwhich rendered possible a careful surveillance by the Crown and the\r\nCompany of the Staple of the quality of the wool offered for sale, and a\r\nseries of regulations against fraud. It must be remembered that in days\r\nwhen trade stood in need of a protection which the Government was not\r\nyet able to give it, there was nothing unpopular in the idea of giving\r\nthe monopoly of the staple trade to the members of a single company.\r\n'Trade in companies is natural to Englishmen,' wrote Bacon; and for four\r\ncenturies it was the great trading companies which nurtured English\r\ntrade and made this country the commercial leader of the world.\r\n\r\nThe wool trade throve in England until the close of the Middle Ages, but\r\nthroughout the fifteenth century the staplers were beginning to feel the\r\ncompetition of another company--that of the famous Merchant Adventurers,\r\nwho, taking advantage of the growth in the native cloth manufacture\r\nduring the previous century, had begun to do a great trade in the export\r\nof cloth. This was obnoxious to the staplers, who desired the\r\ncontinuance of the old system, by which they exported English wool to\r\nthe Continent, where at Ypres and Ghent, Bruges and Mechlin, and the\r\nother famous cloth-working cities of the Netherlands, it was woven into\r\nfine cloth. This cloth manufacture gave to the Netherlands a sort of\r\nindustrial pre-eminence in Europe throughout the Middle Ages, and it was\r\ndependent entirely upon a good supply of English wool, for the next best\r\nwool in Europe--that of Spain--was not satisfactory unless mixed with\r\nwool of English growth. Hence the close political tie between England\r\nand Flanders, the one needing a customer, the other an essential raw\r\nmaterial; for, as a fifteenth century poet said,\r\n\r\n          the lytelle londe of Flaundres is\r\n     But a staple to other londes, iwys,\r\n     And alle that groweth in Flaundres, greyn and sede,\r\n     May not a moneth fynde hem mete and brede.\r\n     What hath thenne Flaundres, be Flemmyngis leffe or lothe\r\n     But a lytelle madere and Flemmyshe cloothe?\r\n     By drapynge of our wolle in substaunce\r\n     Lyvene here comons, this is here governaunce;\r\n     Wythought whyche they may not leve at ease,\r\n     Thus moste hem sterve, or wyth us most have peasse.[2]\r\n\r\nIn those days the coat on the Englishman's back was made out of English\r\nwool, indeed, but it had been manufactured in Flanders, and the staplers\r\nsaw no reason why it should ever be otherwise. As to the Flemings, the\r\npolitical alliances which commercial necessities constantly entailed\r\nbetween the two countries gave rise among them to a proverb that they\r\nbought the fox-skin from the English for a groat and sold them back the\r\ntail for a guelder;[3] but it was the sheepskin which they bought, and\r\nthey were not destined to go on buying it for ever. The great\r\ncloth-making cities of the Netherlands were finally ruined by the growth\r\nof the English cloth manufacture, which absorbed the English wool.\r\nHowever, in spite of the growing prosperity of this trade, which had by\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century ousted that of wool as the chief\r\nEnglish export trade, the Company of the Merchants of the Staple was\r\nstill great and famous throughout the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nMany were the wealthy and respected staplers who were in those days to\r\nbe found directing the destinies of English towns, mayors of London and\r\nprovincial ports, contractors and moneylenders to an impecunious king,\r\nso rich and so powerful that they became a constitutional menace,\r\nalmost, it has been said, a fourth estate of the realm, with which His\r\nMajesty was wont to treat for grants apart from Parliament. Many are the\r\nstaplers' wills preserved in registries up and down England and bearing\r\nwitness to their prosperity and public spirit. Many are the magnificent\r\nbrasses which preserve their memory in the parish churches of the\r\nCotswolds and other wool-growing districts of England. At Chipping\r\nCampden lies William Grevel with his wife, 'late citizen of London and\r\nflower of the wool merchants of all England', who died in 1401, and his\r\nbeautiful house still stands in the village street. At Northleach lies\r\nJohn Fortey, who rebuilt the nave before he died in 1458; his brass\r\nshows him with one foot on a sheep and the other on a woolpack, and the\r\nbrasses of Thomas Fortey, 'woolman', and of another unknown merchant,\r\nwith a woolpack, lie near by. At Linwood, at Cirencester, at Chipping\r\nNorton, at Lechlade, and at All Hallows, Barking, you may see others of\r\nthe great fraternity.[4] They rest in peace now, but when they lived\r\nthey were the shrewdest traders of their day. Of wool, cries the\r\npoet Gower,\r\n\r\nO leine, dame de noblesce\r\nTu est des marchantz la duesse,\r\nPour toy servir tout sont enclin--\r\n\r\n'O wool, noble dame, thou art the goddess of merchants, to serve thee\r\nthey are all ready; by thy good fortune and thy wealth thou makest some\r\nmount high, and others thou bringest to ruin. The staple where thou\r\ndwellest is never free of fraud and trickery, wherewith man wounds his\r\nconscience. O wool, Christians no less than pagans and Saracens seek to\r\nhave thee and confess thee. O wool, we should not be silent about thy\r\ndoings in strange lands; for the merchants of all countries, in time of\r\npeace, in time of war, come to seek thee by reason of their great love,\r\nfor whoever else hath enemies thou art never without good friends, who\r\nhave given themselves to thy profitable service. Thou art cherished\r\nthroughout the world, and the land where thou art born may do great\r\nthings by reason of thee. Thou art carried throughout the world by land\r\nand sea, but thou goest to the wealthiest men; in England art thou born,\r\nbut it is said that thou art but ill governed, for Trick, who hath much\r\nmoney, is made regent of thy staple; at his will he taketh it to foreign\r\nlands, where he purchaseth his own gain to our harm. O fair, O white, O\r\ndelightful one, the love of thee stings and binds, so that the hearts of\r\nthose who make merchandise of thee cannot escape. So they compass much\r\ntrickery and many schemes how they may gather thee, and then they make\r\nthee pass the sea, queen and lady of their navy, and in order to have\r\nthee envy and covetousness hie them to bargain for thee.'[5]\r\n\r\nThe daily life of a Merchant of the Staple is not a difficult one to\r\nreconstruct, partly because the Golden Fleece has left so many marks\r\nupon our national life, partly because the statute book is full of\r\nregulations concerning the wool trade, but chiefly because there have\r\ncome down to us many private letters from persons engaged in shipping\r\nwool from England to Calais. Of all the different sorts of raw material\r\nout of which the history of ordinary people in the Middle Ages has to be\r\nmade, their letters are perhaps the most enthralling, because in their\r\nletters people live and explain themselves in all their individuality.\r\nIn the fifteenth century most men and women of the upper and middle\r\nclasses could read and write, although their spelling was sometimes\r\nmarvellous to behold, and St Olave's Church is apt to become 'Sent\r\nTolowys scryssche' beneath their painfully labouring goose quills, and\r\npunctuation is almost entirely to seek. But what matter? their meaning\r\nis clear enough. Good fortune has preserved in various English archives\r\nseveral great collections of family letters written in the fifteenth\r\ncentury. Finest of all are the famous Paston Letters, written by and to\r\na family of Norfolk gentlefolk, and crammed with information about high\r\npolitics and daily life.[6] Less interesting, but valuable all the same,\r\nare the letters of the Plumptons, who were lords in Yorkshire.[7] But\r\nfor our purposes the most interesting are two other collections, to wit,\r\nthe correspondence of the Stonors, whose estates lay chiefly in\r\nOxfordshire and the neighbouring counties; and the Cely papers, kept by\r\na family of Merchants of the Staple.\r\n\r\nThese two collections give us a vivid picture of wool staplers in their\r\npublic and private lives. The Cely papers cover the years 1475 to 1488,\r\nand it so happens that during that period William Stonor (he became Sir\r\nWilliam in 1478) also became interested in the wool trade, for in 1475\r\nhe married Elizabeth Riche, the daughter and widow of wealthy city\r\nmerchants. The Stonors had great sheep runs on their estates in the\r\nChilterns and Cotswolds, and William readily perceived the advantage of\r\nhis alliance with Elizabeth's family, who were interested in the wool\r\ntrade. Consequently he entered into a partnership with a friend of his\r\nwife's, a Merchant of the Staple in Calais, named Thomas Betson, who is\r\nthe subject of this study, and until Elizabeth's death in 1479, he took\r\nan active part in the export trade. Thomas Betson died in 1486, and was\r\nthus an exact contemporary of those other Merchants of the Staple,\r\nGeorge and Richard Cely, whom he must have known; indeed, William Cely,\r\ntheir cousin and agent, writes from London to George in Calais in 1481,\r\nadvising him that he has dispatched 464 fells to him in the _Thomas_ of\r\nNewhithe, 'and the sayd felles lyeth nexte be afte the maste lowest\r\nunder the felles of Thomas Bettson'.[8] By the aid of the 'Stonor\r\nLetters and Papers', which contain many letters from and concerning him\r\nduring the years of his partnership with Sir William, and of the 'Cely\r\nPapers', which are full of information about the life of a Merchant of\r\nthe Staple at Calais, Thomas Betson may be summoned before us by a\r\nkindly magic until he almost lives again. So he deserves to do, for he\r\nis one of the most delightful people revealed to us in any of the\r\nfifteenth-century letters; for honest charm he has no rival save the\r\nattractive Margery Brews, who married John Paston the younger, and\r\nshows up so pleasantly beside the hard Paston women.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reason why our hearts warm immediately towards Thomas Betson\r\nis that our first meeting with him plunges us immediately into a love\r\naffair. His first letter to William Stonor is dated April 12, 1476, and\r\ninforms William that their wool has come in to Calais. 'Right\r\nworshipfful Syr,' it begins, 'I recomaund me unto your good\r\nmaystershipe, and to my right worshipffulle maystresse your wiffe, and\r\nyf it plese your maystershipe, to my maystresse Kateryn.'[9] Ten days\r\nlater he writes again from London, on the eve of sailing for Calais,\r\nthanking Stonor for his 'gentle cheer and faithful love, the which alway\r\nye bear and owe unto me, and of my behalf nothing deserved[H],'\r\nannouncing that he has sent a present of powdered[I] lampreys from\r\nhimself and a pipe of red wine from his brother, and adding this\r\npostscript: 'Sir, I beseech your mastership that this poor writing may\r\nhave me lowly recommended to my right worshipful mistress, your wife,\r\nand in like wise to my gentle cousin and kind mistress Katherine Riche,\r\nto whom I beseech your mastership ever to be favourable and loving.'[10]\r\nWho was this Katherine Riche to whom he so carefully commends himself?\r\nKatherine Riche was William Stonor's stepdaughter, one of his wife's\r\nchildren by her first husband; she was Thomas Betson's affianced bride,\r\nand at this time she was about thirteen years old.\r\n\r\n[Footnote H: Henceforth I shall modernize spelling, for the reader's\r\nconvenience.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: I.e. pickled.]\r\n\r\nModern opinion, which is happily in favour of falling in love, and of\r\nadult marriages, is often shocked by the air of business which pervades\r\nmatchmaking in the days of chivalry, and by the many cases of grown men\r\nmarried to little girls not yet out of their teens. In those days it was\r\nheld that a boy came of age at fourteen and a girl at twelve (a\r\ndiscrepancy which the great canon lawyer, Lyndwood, the son of a\r\nstapler,[11] attributed to the fact that ill weeds grow apace!). For\r\nreasons of property, or to settle family feuds, or simply to assure\r\ntheir own future, babies in cradles were sometimes betrothed and even\r\nmarried; all that the Church required was that children should be free\r\nwhen they came of age (at the ages of fourteen and twelve!) to repudiate\r\nthe contract if they so desired. Nothing seems to separate modern\r\nEngland from the good old days so plainly as the case of little Grace de\r\nSaleby, aged four, who for the sake of her broad acres was married to a\r\ngreat noble, and on his death two years later to another, and yet again,\r\nwhen she was eleven, to a third, who paid three hundred marks down for\r\nher.[12] There is an odd mixture of humour and pathos in the story of\r\nsome of these marriages. John Rigmarden, aged three, was carried to\r\nchurch in the arms of a priest, who coaxed him to repeat the words of\r\nmatrimony, but half-way through the service the child declared that he\r\nwould learn no more that day, and the priest answered, 'You must speak a\r\nlittle more, and then go play you.' James Ballard, aged ten, was married\r\nto Jane his wife 'at x of the clocke in the night without the consent of\r\nany of his frendes, bie one Sir Roger Blakey, then curate of Colne, and\r\nthe morowe after, the same James declarid vnto his Vnckle that the said\r\nJane [beyinge a bigge damsell and mariageable at the same tyme] had\r\nintised him with two Apples, to go with her to Colne and to marry her.'\r\nElizabeth Bridge _née_ Ramsbotham, says that after her marriage to John\r\nBridge, when he was eleven and she thirteen, he never used her\r\n'lovinglie, insomoche that the first night they were maried, the said\r\nJohn wold Eate no meate at supper, and whan hit was bed tyme, the said\r\nJohn did wepe to go home with his father, he beynge at that tyme at her\r\nbrother's house.'[13]\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, medieval records throw a pleasanter light on these\r\nchild marriages. Such was the light thrown by the Ménagier de Paris's\r\nbook for his young wife, so kindly, so affectionate, so full of\r\nindulgence for her youth; and such also is the light thrown by the\r\ncharming letter which Thomas Betson wrote to little Katherine Riche on\r\nthe first day of June in 1476. It is a veritable gem, and it is strange\r\nthat it has not attracted more notice, for certainly no anthology of\r\nEnglish letters should be without it. I set it down here at length, for\r\nit brings to warm life again both Thomas Betson and Katherine Riche:\r\n\r\nMine own heartily beloved Cousin Katherine, I recommend me unto you with\r\nall the inwardness of my heart. And now lately ye shall understand that\r\nI received a token from you, the which was and is to me right heartily\r\nwelcome, and with glad will I received it; and over that I had a letter\r\nfrom Holake, your gentle squire, by the which I understand right well\r\nthat ye be in good health of body, and merry at heart. And I pray God\r\nheartily in his pleasure to continue the same: for it is to me very\r\ngreat comfort that he so be, so help me Jesu. And if ye would be a good\r\neater of your meat alway, that ye might wax and grow fast to be a woman\r\nye should make me the gladdest man of the world, by my troth; for when I\r\nremember your favour and your sad loving dealing to me wards, for sooth\r\nye make me even very glad and joyous in my heart; and on the tother side\r\nagain, when I remember your young youth, and see well that ye be none\r\neater of your meat, the which should help you greatly in waxing, for\r\nsooth then ye make me very heavy again. And therefore I pray you, mine\r\nown sweet Cousin, even as you love me, to be merry and eat your meat\r\nlike a woman. And if ye will so do for my love, look what ye will desire\r\nof me, whatsoever it be, and by my troth, I promise you by the help of\r\nour Lord to perform it to my power. I can no more say now, but on my\r\ncoming home I will tell you much more between you and me and God before.\r\nAnd whereas ye, full womanly and like a lover, remember me with manifold\r\nrecommendation in divers manners, remitting the same to my discretion to\r\ndepart them there as I love best, for sooth, mine own sweet Cousin, ye\r\nshall understand that with good heart and good will I receive and take\r\nto myself the one half of them and them will I keep by me; and the\r\ntother half with hearty love and favour I send them to you, mine own\r\nsweet Cousin, again, for to keep by you; and over that I send you the\r\nblessing that our Lady gave her dear son, and ever well to fare. I pray\r\nyou greet well my horse and pray him to give you four of his years to\r\nhelp you withal; and I will at my coming home give him four of my years\r\nand four horse loaves till amends. Tell him that I prayed him so. And\r\nCousin Katherine, I thank you for him, and my wife shall thank you for\r\nhim hereafter; for ye do great cost upon him, as is told me. Mine own\r\nsweet Cousin, it was told me but late that ye were at Calais[J] to seek\r\nme, but could not see me nor find me; forsooth ye might have comen to my\r\ncounter, and there ye should both find me and see me, and not have\r\nfaulted of me; but ye sought me in a wrong Calais, and that ye should\r\nwell know if ye were here and saw this Calais, as would God ye were and\r\nsome of them with you that were with you at your gentle Calais. I pray\r\nyou, gentle Cousin, commend me to the clock, and pray him to amend his\r\nunthrifty manners; for he strikes ever in undue time, and he will be\r\never afore, and that is a shrewd condition. Tell him without he amend\r\nhis condition that he will cause strangers to avoid and come no more\r\nthere. I trust to you that he shall amend against mine coming, the which\r\nshall be shortly, with all hands and all feet, with God's grace. My very\r\nfaithful Cousin, I trust to you that though all I have not remembered my\r\nright worshipful mistress your mother afore in this letter, that ye will\r\nof your gentleness recommend me to her mistresship as many times as it\r\nshall please you: and ye may say, if it please you, that in Whitsun week\r\nnext I intend to the mart ward. And I trust you will pray for me; for I\r\nshall pray for you and, so it may be, none so well. And Almighty Jesu\r\nmake you a good woman and send you many good years and long to live in\r\nhealth and virtue to his pleasure. At great Calais, on this side on the\r\nsea, the first day of June, when every man was gone to his dinner, and\r\nthe clock smote nine, and all your household cried after me and bade me\r\n'Come down, come down to dinner at once!'--and what answer I gave them,\r\nye know it of old.\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: Possibly an inn with that name (?).]\r\n\r\nBy your faithful Cousin and lover Thomas Betson. I send you this ring\r\nfor a token.\r\n\r\nSo ending, Thomas Betson smiled, dropped a kiss on the seal and\r\ninscribed his letter, 'To my faithful and heartily beloved cousin\r\nKatherine Riche at Stonor, this letter be delivered in haste.'[14]\r\n\r\nHenceforth there begins a charming triangular correspondence between\r\nBetson and Stonor and Dame Elizabeth Stonor, in which family news and\r\nbusiness negotiations are pleasantly mingled. Dame Elizabeth and Betson\r\nwere on the best of terms, for they had been old friends before her\r\nsecond marriage. A special chamber was kept for him at Stonor, and by an\r\naffectionate anticipation she often refers to him as 'My son Stonor'.\r\nAlmost all her letters to her husband contain news of him--how he took\r\nhis barge at 8 a.m. in the morning and God speed him, how no writing has\r\ncome from him these eight days, how he has now written about the price\r\nto be paid for forty sacks of Cotswold wool, how he recommends him to\r\nSir William and came home last Monday. Sometimes he is entrusted with\r\nthe delicate business of interviewing Dame Elizabeth's mother, a\r\ndifficult old lady with a tongue; 'God send her,' says Thomas, mopping\r\nhis brow, after one of these interviews, 'once a merry countenance or\r\nshortly to the Minories[K]!' After another he writes to Dame Elizabeth:\r\n'Sith I came home to London I met with my lady your mother and God wot\r\nshe made me right sullen cheer with her countenance whiles I was with\r\nher; methought it long till I was departed. She break out to me of her\r\nold \"ffernyeres\" and specially she brake to me of the tale I told her\r\nbetween the vicar that was and her; she said the vicar never fared well\r\nsith, he took it so much to heart. I told her a light answer again and\r\nso I departed from her. I had no joy to tarry with her. She is a fine\r\nmerry woman, but ye shall not know it nor yet find it, nor none of yours\r\nby that I see in her[15].' It was the faithful Betson, too, who was\r\nchosen to look after his Katherine's little sister Anne when she was ill\r\nin London, and he writes home asking for her clothes--'She hath need\r\nunto them and that knoweth our Lord'--and complaining of the old\r\ngrandmother's behaviour: 'If my lady your mother meet my cousin Anne she\r\nwill say no more but \"God's blessing have ye and mine', and so go her\r\nway forth, as though she had no joy of her[16].\" It was Betson, too, who\r\nescorted Dame Elizabeth, when need was, from Windsor to London and wrote\r\nto her husband: 'By the way we were right merry, thanked be God, and so\r\nwith his mercy we mean here to be merry for the season that my lady is\r\nhere, and when your mastership is ready to come hitherwards, we here\r\nshall so welcome you that the season of your abiding shall not be\r\nnoisome, with God's grace[17].' Whereupon Sir William sends a present of\r\ncapons by the carrier to assist the merriment, and Betson reports, 'Sir,\r\nI took two capons, but they were not the best, as ye counselled me by\r\nyour letter to take, and indeed to say the truth I could not be\r\nsuffered. My lady your wife is reasonably strong waxed, the Lord be\r\nthanked, and she took her will in that matter like as she doth in all\r\nother.'[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: The convent of Minoresses, or Franciscan nuns, outside\r\nAldgate.]\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, a hundred evidences of the warmth of Betson's\r\naffection for the Stonors and of the simple piety of his character.\r\nSometimes he ventures to give them good advice. Dame Elizabeth was\r\nsomewhat uplifted by her elevation from the ranks of the mercantile\r\nbourgeoisie to a place among the country gentry, and was apt to be\r\nextravagant, nor was her husband entirely guiltless of running up bills.\r\nWe hear of the ale brewer and the bread baker calling daily upon his\r\nagent for money, and on one occasion the Stonors owed over £12 to\r\nBetson's own brother, a vintner, for various pipes of red and white\r\nwine and a butt of Rumney[L][19]. So Thomas writes to Dame Elizabeth, on\r\nhis way to the mart: 'Our blessed lord Jesus Christ preserve you both in\r\nhonour and worship virtuously to continue in God's pleasure and also to\r\nsend you good and profitable counsel and grace to do hereafter. This is\r\nand shall be my prayer forsooth every day; your honour and worship of\r\ncountenance hereafter sticketh as nigh mine heart as doth any friend,\r\nman or other about you, by my troth, our blessed Lord so help me. I will\r\navise you, Madame, to remember large expenses and beware of them, and in\r\nlikewise my master your husband; it is well done ye remember him of\r\nthem, for divers considerations, as ye know both right well. And our\r\nblessed Lord be your comforter and help in all your good work.\r\nAmen.'[20] A month later he hears that William Stonor has been ill and\r\nwrites to sympathize with Dame Elizabeth: 'And if I could do anything\r\nhere that might be to his pleasure and yours, I would I knew it and it\r\nshould be done withouten fail. Truly your discomfort is not my comfort,\r\nGod knoweth it. Nevertheless your ladyship must cause him to be merry\r\nand of glad cheer, and to put away all fantasies and unthrifty thoughts,\r\nthat comes no good of, but only hurtful. A man may hurt himself by\r\nriotous means; it is good to beware.'[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: Greek wine.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile what of little Katherine Riche? She recurs over and over in\r\nThomas Betson's letters. Occasionally she is in disgrace, for she was\r\nnot handy with her pen. 'I am wroth with Katherine,' writes he to her\r\nmother, 'because she sendeth me no writing. I have to her divers times\r\nand for lack of answer I wax weary; she might get a secretary if she\r\nwould and if she will not, it shall put me to less labour to answer her\r\nletters again.'[22] But the important thing is that she grows steadily\r\nolder, though not quickly enough to please our lover. On Trinity Sunday\r\nin 1478 he writes to Dame Elizabeth: 'I remember her full oft, God\r\nknow[eth] it. I dreamed once she was thirty winters of age and when I\r\nwoke I wished she had been but twenty and so by likelihood I am sooner\r\nlike to have my wish than my dream, the which I beseech Almighty Jesu\r\nheartily when it shall please Him'[23]; and to the lady's stepfather he\r\nwrites a month later: 'I beseech you to remember my cousin Katherine. I\r\nwould she did well, God knoweth it, and ye deme, as I trow, if I had\r\nfound her at home here my comfort should have been the more; but I thank\r\nGod of all. My pain is the more; I must needs suffer as I have done in\r\ntimes past, and so will I do for God's sake and hers.'[24] However,\r\nKatherine was now fifteen years of age and was sufficiently grown up to\r\nwed, and the next letter, written a week later to Dame Elizabeth, shows\r\nus Thomas Betson beginning to set his house in order and getting\r\nexceedingly bothered about laying in her trousseau, a business with\r\nwhich Dame Elizabeth had, it seems, entrusted the future bridegroom.\r\n\r\nMadam, and it like you, I understand by your writing that it will be the\r\nlatter end of August or your ladyship can come here to London; and if it\r\nshould be so I would be sorry, for I have much to do and I can little\r\nskill to do anything that longeth to the matter ye wot of [evidently the\r\npreparations for Katherine] ... I must beseech your ladyship to send me\r\n[your advice] how I shall be demeaned in such things as shall belong\r\nunto my cousin Katherine, and how I shall provide for them. She must\r\nhave girdles, three at the least, and how they shall be made I know not,\r\nand many other things she must have, ye know well what they be, in faith\r\nI know not; by my troth, I would it were done, liever than more than it\r\nshall cost.... And as for the sending hither of my Cousin Katherine,\r\nyour ladyship may do therein as it shall please you. I would she knew as\r\nmuch as you know, forsooth, and then she should do some good and help me\r\nin many things when she come.... Also, madam, as ye write me the\r\ncourteous dealing of my master with my Cousin Katherine, etc., truly I\r\nam very glad thereof and I pray God heartily thank him therefore, for he\r\nhath ever been lovingly disposed [unto] her, and so I beseech God ever\r\ncontinue him and also my Cousin Katherine to deserve it unto him by her\r\ngoodly demeanour and womanly disposition, as she can do right well if\r\nher list, and so saith every body that praiseth her.[25]\r\n\r\nThe note of pride in the last words is as engaging as the impatience of\r\nthe harassed male faced with the choosing of girdles. Even more charming\r\nis the letter which he wrote the same day to Sir William Stonor. He is a\r\nlittle incoherent with joy and gratitude, full of regrets that business\r\nkeeps him from Stonor and good wishes for the health of the family. 'I\r\nfare like a sorry piper,' he says. 'When I begin I cannot leave, but\r\nyet once again our blessed Lord be your speed and your help,' Of\r\nKatherine he writes thus:\r\n\r\nI understand by the worshipful report of your mastership the\r\n[be]haviours of my cousin Katherine unto you, to my lady your wife and\r\nto all other, etc.; and truly it is to me right joyful and comfortable\r\ngladness to hear of her and I beseech our blessed Lord ever to preserve\r\nher in all virtue and good living to his pleasure, and to reward your\r\nmastership with heaven at your ending, for your good disposition to\r\nherwards in good exhortations giving. And that I wot well of old, or\r\nelse truly she could not be of that disposition, virtuous and goodly,\r\nher youth remembered and excused.... Sir, remember your mastership well\r\nwhat ye have written of my Cousin Katherine; truly I shall when I speak\r\nwith her, tell her every word, and if I find the contrary. Our vicar\r\nhere, so God help me, shall cry out upon her[M] within this ten weeks\r\nand less, and by that time I shall be ready in every point, by God's\r\ngrace, and so I would she were, forsooth ye may believe me of it.[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: I.e. call the banns.]\r\n\r\nThis letter was written on June 24, 1478, and Thomas probably married\r\nhis little Katherine in August or September, for when Dame Elizabeth\r\nwrites to her husband on October 5, she says, 'My son Betson and his\r\nwife recommend them to you'[27] The poor child was to learn soon enough\r\nsome of the sorrows of a wife, for a year later Thomas Betson fell\r\ndangerously ill, and she was nursing him and looking after his business\r\nfor all the world as though she were a grave matron and not a bride of\r\nsixteen. Moreover, she must already have been expecting the birth of her\r\neldest son. William Stonor's attitude towards his partner's illness is\r\nnot without humour. He was torn between anxiety for the life of a friend\r\nand an even greater anxiety that Betson should not die without setting\r\nstraight the business obligations between them. We hear of the illness\r\nand of Katherine's labours in a letter from one of Stonor's agents to\r\nhis master:\r\n\r\nSir, according to the commandment of your mastership, we were at Stepney\r\nby nine of the clock; at such time as we came thither we saw the\r\ngentleman forthwith, and in good faith he made us good cheer as a sick\r\nman might by countenance notwithstanding, for in good faith we saw by\r\nhis demeanour that he might not prosper in this world, for Mistress\r\nBevice and other gentlewomen and his uncle were of the same opinion. And\r\nwe desired and prayed him to be of good comfort and so comforted him as\r\nheartily as we could in your name and in my lady's, and so we departed\r\nfrom the chamber down into the hall, and he fell into a great slumbering\r\nand was busily moved in his spirits. And at eleven of the clock I called\r\nhis uncle out of his bed into the gentleman's chamber, and I asked his\r\nadvice and my mistress his wife, of the stock and of the demeanour\r\nthereof for the year and the half that is last past. And touching the\r\nstock he confessed that it was £1,160, wherein at the sight of your\r\nacquittance in discharging of him and all his doers that shall be behind\r\nhim, the said stock shall be ready. And as for the occupation of it, as\r\nhe will answer between God and devil, the book that he bought it by ye\r\nshall be privy thereto; and the book that he sold by ye shall be also\r\nprivy to, which two books shall be his judges, which remain in the\r\nkeeping of my mistress his wife's hands under lock and key and other\r\nbills and obligations according, concerning the surety for divers\r\npayments to be made to divers merchants, as the said lord saith.... And\r\nas for the plate my mistress Jane [probably Jane Riche, the younger\r\nsister of Katherine] and I have caused it to be taken up and set in\r\nsurety, save that that must needs by occupied.\r\n\r\nHe sends to Sir William for information about two sums of £80 each owed\r\nby Betson to his master and mistress, and adds:\r\n\r\nI trust to Jesu he shall endure till the messenger come again; longer\r\nthe physicians have not determined. The executors be three persons, my\r\nmistress his wife, Humphrey Starkey, Recorder of London, Robert Tate,\r\nmerchant of Calais; notwithstanding I moved him, between him and me and\r\nmistress Jane, that he should break this testament and make my mistress\r\nhis wife sole executrix. What will be done therein as yet I cannot\r\nspeak, but I shall do as I can, with God's grace.[28]\r\n\r\nThere is something unexpected and a little vulture-like about this\r\ngathering of creditors and seizing of plate about the death-bed of a man\r\nwho had always, after all, shown himself exceedingly affectionate\r\ntowards the Stonors and devoted to their interests, and who was now my\r\nlady's son-in-law. The attempt to make the young wife of sixteen sole\r\nexecutrix, so that she might be completely in her family's hands and\r\nwithout the counsel of two experienced and disinterested merchants, has\r\na somewhat sinister air. The intrigues went on, and three days later\r\nthe agent writes again. It is pleasant to observe that bad-tempered old\r\nMistress Croke, Dame Elizabeth's mother, was not unmindful of Betson's\r\nforbearance during those visits when she had railed upon him with her\r\nsharp tongue:\r\n\r\nAs for the tidings that is here, I trust to God it shall be very good.\r\nOn Thursday my lady Croke came to Stepney and brought with her Master\r\nBrinkley to see Betson, and in faith he was a very sick man; and ere he\r\ndeparted he gave him plasters to his head, to his stomach and to his\r\nbelly, [so] that he all that night was in a quiet rest. And he came to\r\nhim again on Friday ... and he was well amended and so said all the\r\npeople that were about him. Notwithstanding he will not determine him\r\nwhether he shall live or die as yet, but he may keep him alive till\r\nTuesday noon, he will undertake him. The cause that I write to you now\r\nrather was because I had no certainty. Sir, there hath been many special\r\nlabours and secret i-made, sithen mistress Jane and I were come, to the\r\ncontrary disposition that we come for. I cannot write the plain[nes]s of\r\nthem as yet, for my mistress Betson attendeth, all things and counsels\r\nlaid apart, to abide and trust in your good fatherhood and in my lady,\r\nand furthermore if he depart the world, ye shall hear tidings of her in\r\nas goodly haste as we may purvey for her. And whether he die or live, it\r\nis necessary and behoveful that mistress Jane depart not from her into\r\n[i.e. until] such time as the certainty be knowen, for in truth divers\r\nfolks, which ye shall know hereafter and my lady, both thus hath and\r\nwould exhort her to a contrarier disposition, had not we been here by\r\ntime. And mistress Jane is worthy of much thank.[29]\r\n\r\nHowever, all the schemings were premature, for Betson happily recovered.\r\nOn October 10 the 'prentice' Henham writes: 'My master Betson is right\r\nwell amended, blessed be Jesus, and he is past all doubts of sickness\r\nand he takes the sustenance right well, and as for physicians, there\r\ncome none unto him, for he hath no need of them.'[30] But another death\r\nwas at hand to break the close association between Thomas Betson and the\r\nStonors, for at the end of the year the kind, extravagant, affectionate\r\nDame Elizabeth died. It is a surprising fact that her death seems to\r\nhave brought to a close the business partnership between her husband and\r\nher son-in-law. Henceforth the only references to Thomas Betson in the\r\nStonor papers are occasional notes of his debts to Stonor: doubtless he\r\nhad bought Sir William's share in their joint business. On March 10,\r\n1480, he acknowledged obligations of £2,835 9s. 0d. to Stonor, and in\r\n1482 he still owed £1,200.[31] It is impossible to guess why the\r\nrelationship, which was an affectionate personal friendship as well as a\r\nbusiness tie, should have come to such a sudden end. As the editor of\r\nthe _Stonor Letters_ remarks, 'The sincerity and honesty of Betson's\r\ncharacter as revealed in his letters, forbids one to suppose that he was\r\nto blame.'\r\n\r\nSuch was the more private and domestic side of Thomas Betson's life; but\r\nit tells us little (save in occasional references to the Fellowship of\r\nthe Staple or the price of Cotswold wool) about that great company with\r\nwhich this chapter began; and since he stands here as a type as well as\r\nan individual, we must needs turn now to his public and business life,\r\nand try to find out from more indirect evidence how a Merchant of the\r\nStaple went about his business. The stapler, who would make a good\r\nlivelihood, must do two things, and give his best attention to both of\r\nthem: first, he must buy his wool from the English grower, then he must\r\nsell it to the foreign buyer. Some of the best wool in England came from\r\nthe Cotswolds, and when you are a Merchant of the Staple you enjoy\r\nbargaining for it, whether you want the proceeds of the great summer\r\nclip or of the fells after the autumn sheep-killing. So Thomas Betson\r\nrides off to Gloucestershire in the soft spring weather, his good sorrel\r\nbetween his knees, and the scent of the hawthorn blowing round him as he\r\ngoes. Other wool merchants ride farther afield--into the long dales of\r\nYorkshire to bargain with Cistercian abbots for the wool from their huge\r\nflocks, but he and the Celys swear by Cotswold fells (he shipped 2,348\r\nof them to London one July 'in the names of Sir William Stonor knight\r\nand Thomas Betson, in the _Jesu_ of London, John Lolyngton master under\r\nGod'). May is the great month for purchases, and Northleach the great\r\nmeeting-place of staplers and wool dealers. It is no wonder that\r\nNorthleach Church is so full of woolmen's brasses, for often they knelt\r\nthere, and often the village hummed with the buyers and sellers,\r\nexchanging orders and examining samples. The Celys bought chiefly from\r\ntwo Northleach wool dealers, William Midwinter and John Busshe. The\r\nrelations between dealers and sellers were often enough close and\r\npleasant: Midwinter even occasionally tried to provide a customer with a\r\nbride as well as with a cargo, and marriageable young ladies were not\r\nunwilling to be examined over a gallon of wine and much good cheer at\r\nthe inn.[32] It is true that Midwinter was apt to be restive when his\r\nbills remained for too long unpaid, but he may be forgiven for that.\r\nThomas Betson favoured the wool fells of Robert Turbot of Lamberton,[33]\r\nand dealt also with one John Tate, with Whyte of Broadway (another\r\nfamous wool village),[34] and with John Elmes, a Henley merchant well\r\nknown to the Stonors. Midwinter, Busshe, and Elmes were all wool\r\ndealers, or 'broggers'--middlemen, that is to say, between the farmers\r\nwho grew and the staplers who bought wool, but often the staplers dealt\r\ndirectly with individual farmers, buying the small man's clip as well as\r\nthe great man's, and warm friendships sprang from the annual visits,\r\nlooked forward to in Yorkshire dale and Cotswold valley. It strikes a\r\npleasant note when Richard Russell, citizen and merchant of York, leaves\r\nin his will, 'for distribution among the farmers of Yorkes Walde, from\r\nwhom I bought wool 20 l., and in the same way among the farmers of\r\nLyndeshay 10 l.' (1435).[35]\r\n\r\nThe 'Cely Letters' give a mass of information about the wool buying at\r\nNorthleach. In the May of the same year in which Betson's partnership\r\nwith Stonor would seem to have ended, old Richard Cely was up there\r\ndoing business and reporting it to his son, 'Jorge Cely at Caleys'.\r\n\r\n     I greet you well and I have received a letter from you writ\r\n     at Calais the 13th day of May (1480), the which letter I have\r\n     well understood of your being at the marts and of the sale of\r\n     my middle wool, desired by John Destermer and John Underbay.\r\n     Wherefore by the grace of God I am abusied for to ship this\r\n     foresaid 29 sarplers, the which I bought of William Midwinter\r\n     of Northleach, 26 sarplers, the which is fair wool, as the\r\n     wool packer Will Breten saith to me, and also the 3 sarplers\r\n     of the rector's is fair wool, much finer wool nor was the\r\n     year before, the which I shipped afore Easter last past. The\r\n     shipping is begun at London, but I have none shipped as yet,\r\n     but I will after these holy days, for the which I will ye\r\n     order for the freight and other costs. This same day your\r\n     brother Richard Cely is rid to Northleach for to see and cast\r\n     a sort of fell for me and another sort of fell for you.[36]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he writes: 'By your letter you avise me for to buy\r\nwool in Cotswold, for which I shall have of John Cely his gathering 30\r\nsack, and of Will Midwinter of Northleach 40 sack. And I am avised to\r\nbuy no more; wool in Cotswold is at great price, 13s. 4d. a tod, and\r\ngreat riding for wool in Cotswold as was any year this seven year.'[37]\r\nWhat a picture it calls up of merchants trotting along the roads and\r\nlooking as Chaucer often saw them look:\r\n\r\nA Marchant was ther with a forked berd,\r\nIn motteleye and hye on horse he sat,\r\nUpon his heed a Flaundryssh bever hat,\r\nHis boots clasped faire and fetisly;\r\nHis resons he spak ful solempnely,\r\nSounynge alway thencrees of his wynnyng.\r\n\r\nOften at Northleach Betson must have encountered his brethren of the\r\nStaple, the staid old merchant Richard Cely among the rest, and son\r\nGeorge who rides with 'Meg', his hawk, on his wrist, and has a horse\r\ncalled 'Bayard' and another called 'Py'; and perhaps also John Barton of\r\nHolme beside Newark, the proud stapler who set as a 'posy' in the\r\nstained glass windows of his house this motto:\r\n\r\nI thank God and ever shall\r\nIt is the sheepe hath payed for all;[38]\r\n\r\nthough indeed it is unlikely that he came as far south as the Cotswolds\r\nfor his wool. Sometimes also Betson meets upon the road his rivals,\r\nstout, self-possessed Flemings and thin sleek Lombards with black eyes\r\nand gesticulating hands, who have no business in the Cotswolds at all,\r\nbut ought to be buying wool in the mart at Calais. But they come, and\r\nall good Englishmen are angry at their tricks and angrier still perhaps\r\nat their successful trade. 'I have not as yet packed my wool in London,'\r\nwrites old Richard Cely on October 29, 1480; 'nor have I not bought this\r\nyear a lock of wool, for the wool of Cotswold is bought by Lombards,\r\nwherefore I have the less haste for to pack my wool at London';[39] and\r\nhis son writes to him on November 16 from Calais: 'There is but little\r\nCotswold wool at Calais and I understand Lombards has bought it up in\r\nEngland.'[40] It is true that the Celys, other English merchants too,\r\nare not unwilling to conclude private bargains from time to time with\r\nforeign buyers in England. Two years later their agent, William Cely,\r\nwrites to advise them that two Flemish merchants are now trying to buy\r\nin England contrary to the ordinance, and that those in authority at\r\nCalais have got wind of it, and therefore his masters must take care and\r\nmake Wyllykyn and Peter Bale pay at Calais, 'but as for your dealings\r\nknoweth no man, without they search Peter Bale's books.'[41] The upright\r\nBetson no doubt eschewed such tricks and resented particularly the\r\nclever usurious Lombards, so full of financial dodges to trick the\r\nEnglish merchant, for did they not buy the wool in England on credit,\r\nriding about as they list in the Cotswolds?\r\n\r\nIn Cotteswolde also they ryde aboute\r\nAnd al Englonde, and bien wythouten doute,\r\nWhat them liste, wythe fredome and fraunchise\r\nMore then we Englisshe may getyn in any wyse.\r\n\r\nAnd then did they not carry the wool to Flanders and sell it for ready\r\nmoney at a loss of five per cent, thereafter lending out this money at\r\nheavy usury, mostly to the English merchants themselves, so that by the\r\ntime pay day came in England, they had realized a heavy profit?\r\n\r\nAnd thus they wold, if we will beleve\r\nWypen our nose with our owne sleve,\r\nThow this proverbe be homly and undew,\r\nYet be liklynesse it is forsoth fulle trew.[42]\r\n\r\nThe next serious piece of business Thomas Betson must take in hand is\r\nthe packing and shipping of his wool to Calais. Here he found himself\r\nenmeshed in the regulations of the company and the Crown, ever on the\r\nlook-out for fraud in the packing or description of the staple product.\r\nThe wool had to be packed in the county from which it came, and there\r\nwere strict regulations against mixing hair and earth or rubbish with\r\nit. The collectors appointed by the company for the different\r\nwool-growing districts, and sworn in before the Exchequer, rode round\r\nand sealed each package, so that it could not be opened without breaking\r\nthe seal. Then the great bales were carried on the backs of pack-horses\r\n'by the ancient trackways over the Wiltshire and Hampshire Downs, which\r\nhad been used before the Roman conquest, and thence through Surrey and\r\nKent to the Medway ports by the Pilgrims' Way.' At the different ports\r\nthe collectors of customs were ready to enter on their rolls the names\r\nof the merchants shipping wool, together with the quantity and\r\ndescription of wool shipped by each.[43] Some of the wool came to London\r\nitself, where many of the staplers had offices in Mark Lane (which is a\r\ncorruption of Mart Lane) and was weighed for the assessment of the\r\ncustoms and subsidy at the Leadenhall.[44] In this business Thomas\r\nBetson was helped by Stonor's three assistants or 'prentices', as they\r\ncall themselves, Thomas Henham, Goddard Oxbridge, and Thomas Howlake,\r\nfor the last of whom he had a warm corner in his heart, because the\r\nyoung man was gentle to little Katherine Riche. These men were sometimes\r\nat the Stonors' London warehouse and sometimes at their house in Calais,\r\nand they saved Betson a good deal of trouble, being experienced enough\r\nto oversee both the packing of wool in London and its sale in Calais.\r\n\r\nTo Calais the wool thus packed, and weighed and marked and assessed by\r\nthe customs officer, was carried in the ships of Calais itself, or of\r\nthe little ports on the east or south-eastern coast of England, many of\r\nwhich are mere villages today. For ships put out not only from Hull and\r\nColchester, but from Brightlingsea, Rotherhithe, Walberswick in Suffolk,\r\nRainham in Essex, Bradwell, Maidstone, Milton, Newhithe, and Milhall. In\r\nAugust 1478, the Celys were paying the masters of twenty-one different\r\nships for the freight of their sarplers of wool after the summer\r\nclip.[45] All through the summer the shipping went on, and right up to\r\nChristmas; but during the winter months the merchants were mostly\r\nsending over fells or sheepskins, after the great slaughter of sheep and\r\ncattle which took place at Martinmas, when housewives salted down their\r\nmeat for the winter and farmers made delivery of the fells and hides,\r\nfor which the staplers had long ago bargained. Very often merchants'\r\nletters and customs accounts give us the names of these doughty little\r\nships and their cargoes. In the October of 1481, for instance, the Celys\r\nwere shipping a consignment of fells:\r\n\r\nRight worshipful sir, after due recommendation I lowly recommend unto\r\nyou, letting you understand that my master hath shipped his fells at the\r\nport of London now at this shipping in October ..., which fells ye must\r\nreceive and pay the freight first by the grace of God, in the 'Mary' of\r\nLondon, William Sordyvale master, 7 packs, sum 2800, lying be aft the\r\nmast, one pack lieth up rest and some of that pack is summer fells\r\nmarked with an O, and then lieth 3 packs fells of William Daltons and\r\nunder them lieth the other 6 packs of my masters. Item in the\r\n'Christopher' of Rainham, Harry Wylkyns master, 7 packs and a half\r\nCots[wold] fell, sum 3000 pelt, lying be aft the mast, and under them\r\nlieth a 200 fells of Welther Fyldes, William Lyndys man of Northampton,\r\nand the partition is made with small cords. Item, in the 'Thomas' of\r\nMaidstone, Harry Lawson master, 6 pokes, sum 2400 pelt, whereof lieth 5\r\npacks next before the mast under hatches, no man above them, and one\r\npack lieth in the stern sheet; of the six packs fells be some summer\r\nfells marked with an O likewise. Item, in the 'Mary Grace' of London,\r\nJohn Lokyngton master 6 packs, sum 2400 pelt, lying be aft under the\r\nfells of Thomas Graunger, the partition between them is made with red;\r\nsum of the fells my master hath shipped at this time 26 packs and a half\r\nwhereof be winter fells of the country 561 fells and they be marked with\r\nan C, and of summer fells there should be 600 and more, but part of them\r\nbe left behind, for we have two packs we could have no appointment for\r\nthem, and all the summer fells be marked with an O. Item, sir, ye shall\r\nreceive of the 'Mary' of Rainham, John Danyell master, your _male_\r\n[trunk] with your gear and a Essex cheese marked with my master's mark.\r\n\r\nAnd so on, with details of the number of fells shipped in like manner by\r\nthe _Michael_ of Hull and the _Thomas_ of Newhithe, where they lay 'next\r\nthe mast aftward under the fells of Thomas Betson's', over 11,000 fells\r\nin all.[46]\r\n\r\nHow invigorating is such a list of ships. Cargoes are the most romantic\r\nof topics, whether they be apes and ivory and peacocks, or 'cheap tin\r\ntrays'; and since the day that Jason sailed to Colchis fleeces have ever\r\nbeen among the most romantic of cargoes. How they smack of the salt too,\r\nthose old master mariners, Henry Wilkins, master of the _Christopher_ of\r\nRainham, John Lollington, master of the _Jesu_ of London, Robert Ewen,\r\nmaster of the _Thomas_ of Newhithe, and all the rest of them, waving\r\ntheir hands to their wives and sweethearts as they sail out of the\r\nsparkling little bays, with the good woolsacks abaft or under\r\nhatches--shipmen, all of them, after Chaucer's heart:\r\n\r\nBut of his craft, to rekene wel his tydes\r\nHis stremes and his daungers hym besides,\r\nHis herberwe and his moone, his lodemenage,\r\nTher was noon swich from Hulle to Cartage.\r\nHardy he was, and wys to undertake:\r\nWith many a tempest hadde his berd been shake;\r\nHe knew wel alle the havenes, as they were,\r\nFrom Gootland to the Cape of Fynystere,\r\nAnd every cryke in Britaigne and in Spayne.\r\nHis barge y-cleped was the Maudelayne.\r\n\r\nTheir ships were doubtless like the _Margaret Cely_, which the two Cely\r\nbrothers bought and called after their mother, for the not excessive sum\r\nof £28, exclusive of rigging and fittings. She carried a master,\r\nboatswain, cook, and sixteen jolly sailor-men, and she kept a good look\r\nout for pirates and was armed with cannon and bows, bills, five dozen\r\ndarts, and twelve pounds of gunpowder! She was victualled with salt\r\nfish, bread, wheat and beer, and she plied with the Celys' trade to\r\nZealand, Flanders, and Bordeaux.[47] She must have been about two\r\nhundred tons, but some of the other little ships were much smaller, for,\r\nas the learned editor of the _Cely Papers_ tells us, 'The ships of the\r\nlittle Medway ports could scarcely have been of thirty tons to navigate\r\nthe river safely; the \"Thomas\" of Maidstone can have been only a barge,\r\nif she had to pass Aylesford Bridge.'[48] But they navigated the channel\r\nand dodged the pirates blithely enough, though often Thomas Betson at\r\nCalais was nervous about the safe arrival of the wool fleet. Like\r\nChaucer's merchant,\r\n\r\nHe wolde the see were kept for any thing\r\nBetwixe Middelburgh and Orewelle.\r\n\r\nSide by side with George or Richard Cely he must often have strained his\r\neyes from the quay, with the salt wind blowing out the feather in his\r\ncap, and breathed a thanksgiving to God when the ships hove in sight.\r\n'And, Sir,' he writes once to Stonor from London, 'thanked be the good\r\nLord, I understand for certain that our wool shipped be comen in ... to\r\nCalais. I would have kept the tidings till I had comen myself, because\r\nit is good, but I durst not be so bold, for your mastership now against\r\nthis good time may be glad and joyful of these tidings, for in truth I\r\nam glad and heartily thank God of it.'[49] The 'prentice' Thomas Henham\r\nwrites likewise three weeks later: 'I departed from Sandwich the 11th\r\nday of April and so came unto Calais upon Sher Thursday[N] last with the\r\nwool ships, and so blessed be Jesu I have received your wools in safety.\r\nFurthermore, Sir, if it please your mastership for to understand this, I\r\nhave received your wools as fair and as whole as any man's in the fleet.\r\nMoreover, Sir, if it please your mastership for to understand how your\r\nwool was housed ever deal by Easter even. Furthermore, Sir, if it please\r\nyour mastership for to understand that the shipman be content and paid\r\nof their freight.'[50] The Celys write in the same strain too: 'This day\r\nthe 16th of August the wool fleet came to Calais both of London and\r\nIpswich in safety, thanked be God, and this same day was part landed and\r\nit riseth fair yet, thanked be God.'[51] Their letters tell us too what\r\ndanger it was that they feared. 'I pray Jesu send you safe hither and\r\nsoon,' writes Richard to his 'right well beloved brother George', on\r\nJune 6, 1482. 'Robert Eryke was chased with Scots between Calais and\r\nDover. They scaped narrow.'[52] There are many such chases recorded, and\r\nwe hear too of wool burnt under hatches or cast overboard in a\r\nstorm.[53]\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: I.e. Shrove Thursday.]\r\n\r\nThomas Betson and the Celys travelled very often across the Channel in\r\nthese ships, which carried passengers and letters, and they were almost\r\nas much at home in Calais as in London. When in Calais English merchants\r\nwere not allowed to live anywhere they liked, all over the town. The\r\nCompany of the Staple had a list of regular licensed 'hosts', in whose\r\nhouses they might stay. Usually a number of merchants lived with each\r\nhost, the most potent, grave, and reverend seniors dining at a high\r\ntable, and smaller fry at side tables in the hall. Sometimes they\r\nquarrelled over terms, as when William Cely writes home one day to\r\nRichard and George in London:\r\n\r\nItem. Sir, please it you to understand that here is a variance betwixt\r\nour host Thomas Graunger and the fellowship, of our lodging, for Thomas\r\nGraunger promised us at his coming in to our lodging that we should pay\r\nno more for our board but 3s. 4d. a week at the high table, and 2s. 6d.\r\nat the side table, and now he saith he will have no less than 4s. a week\r\nat the high table and 40d. at the side table, wherefore the fellowship\r\nhere will depart into other lodgings, some to one place and some to\r\nanother, William Dalton will be at Robert Torneys and Ralph Temyngton\r\nand master Brown's man of Stamford shall be at Thomas Clarke's and so\r\nall the fellowship departs save I, wherefore I let your masterships have\r\nknowledge, that ye may do as it shall like you best.[54]\r\n\r\nBut Thomas Betson never fell out with his hosts, whose only complaint of\r\nhim must have been that he sat long over his love letters and came down\r\nlate to dinner.\r\n\r\nThere was business enough for him to do at Calais. First of all, when\r\nthe wool was landed, it had to be inspected by the Royal officers, to\r\nsee that it had been properly labelled, and their skilled packers\r\nexamined, repacked, and resealed the bales. This was an anxious moment\r\nfor merchants who were conscious of inferior wool among their bulging\r\nsarplers. The honest Betson, we may be certain, never cheated, but the\r\nCelys knew more than a little about the tricks of the trade, and one\r\nyear, when the Lieutenant of Calais took out sarpler No. 24, which their\r\nagent, William Cely, knew to be poor wool, in order to make a test, he\r\nprivily substitutes No. 8, which was 'fair wool' and changed the labels,\r\nso that he was soon able to write home, 'Your wool is awarded by the\r\nsarpler that I cast out last.'[55] No wonder Gower said that Trick was\r\nregent of the Staple,\r\n\r\nSiq'en le laines maintenir\r\nJe voi plusours descontenir\r\nDu loyalté la viele usance.[56]\r\n\r\nThen there was the custom and subsidy to be paid to the Mayor and\r\nFellowship of the Staple, who collected it for the King. And then came\r\nthe main business of every merchant, the selling of the wool. Thomas\r\nBetson preferred, of course, to sell it as quickly as possible, as the\r\nships came in, but sometimes the market was slow and wool remained for\r\nsome months on his hands. Such wool from the summer sheep shearing,\r\nshipped in or before the month of February following, and remaining\r\nunsold by April 6th, was classed as old wool, and the Fellowship of the\r\nStaple ordained that foreign buyers must take one sarpler of old wool\r\nwith every three of new; and although the Flemings grumbled and wanted\r\nto take one of old to five of new, they had to put up with the\r\nregulation.[57] A great deal of Betson's business would be done at the\r\nmart of Calais itself, where he met with the dignified Flemish\r\nmerchants, scions of old families with estates of their own, and the\r\nmore plebeian merchants of Delft and Leyden, and the wool dealers from\r\nsunny Florence and Genoa and Venice. Among the best customers both of\r\nthe Stonors and the Celys (for they are mentioned in the letters of\r\nboth) were Peter and Daniel van de Rade of Bruges. Thomas Howlake on one\r\noccasion reports a sale of four sarplers of fine Cotswold wool to them\r\nat 19 marks the sack, with a rebate of 4-1/2 cloves on the sack of 52,\r\nand adds: 'Sir, an it please you, as for the foresaid merchants that\r\nhave bought your wool, [they] be as good as any that came out of\r\nFlanders and for that I have showed them the more favour and given them\r\nthe more respite of that.'[58]\r\n\r\nThe staplers, however, did not do business at Calais alone, but rode\r\nalso to the great fairs at Antwerp, Bruges, and the country round.\r\n'Thomas Betson,' writes Henham to his master, 'came unto Calais the last\r\nday of April and so he departed in good health unto Bruges mart the\r\nfirst day of May.'[59]\r\n\r\nBut so bifel this marchant on a day\r\nShoop hym to make redy his array\r\nToward the toun of Brugges for to fare,\r\nTo byen there a porcioun of ware--[60]\r\n\r\nonly it was to 'sellen' a portion that Betson went. He himself writes\r\nSir William: 'Liketh it you to wit that on Trinity even I came to Calais\r\nand, thanked be the good Lord, I had a full fair passage, and, Sir, with\r\nGod's might I intend on Friday next to depart to the mart-wards. I\r\nbeseech the good Lord be my speed and help me in all my works. And, Sir,\r\nI trust to God's mercy, if the world be merry here, to do somewhat that\r\nshall be both to your profit and mine. As yet there cometh but few\r\nmerchants here; hereafter with God's grace there will come more. I shall\r\nlose no time when the season shall come, I promise you.... And, Sir,\r\nwhen I come from the mart I shall send you word of all matters by the\r\nmercy of our Lord.'[61] At the fairs Betson would meet with a great\r\ncrowd of merchants from all over Europe, though often enough political\r\ndisturbances made the roads dangerous and merchants ran some risk of\r\nbeing robbed. The English traders were commonly reputed to be the best\r\nsellers and customers at the fairs of Flanders and Brabant, though the\r\nFlemings sometimes complained of them, and said that the staplers made\r\nregulations forbidding their merchants to buy except on the last day,\r\nwhen the Flemish sellers, anxious to pack and be off, let their goods go\r\nat insufficient prices.[62] The author of the _Libelle of Englyshe\r\nPolycye_ boasts proudly of the custom brought by the English to\r\nthese marts:\r\n\r\nBut they of Holonde at Calyse byene oure felles,\r\nAnd oure wolles, that Englyshe men hem selles...\r\nAnd wee to martis of Braban charged bene\r\nWyth Englysshe clothe, fulle gode and feyre to seyne,\r\nWee bene ageyne charged wyth mercerye\r\nHaburdasshere ware and wyth grocerye,\r\nTo whyche martis, that Englisshe men call feyres\r\nIche nacion ofte makethe here repayeres,\r\nEnglysshe and Frensh, Lumbards, Januayes [Genoese],\r\nCathalones, theder take here wayes,\r\nScottes, Spaynardes, Iresshmen there abydes,\r\nWythe grete plente bringing of salt hydes,\r\nAnd I here saye that we in Braban lye,\r\nFlaunders and Seland, we bye more marchaundy\r\nIn common use, then done all other nacions;\r\nThis have I herde of marchaundes relacions,\r\nAnd yff the Englysshe be not in the martis,\r\nThey bene febelle and as nought bene here partes;\r\nFor they bye more and fro purse put owte\r\nMore marchaundy than alle other rowte.[63]\r\n\r\nFairs were held at different times in different places, but there were\r\nduring the year four great fair seasons corresponding to the four\r\nseasons in the year.[64] There was the Cold mart in the winter, to which\r\nThomas Betson rode muffled in fur, with his horse's hoofs ringing on the\r\nfrosty roads; there was the Pask (_Pasques,_ Easter) mart in the spring,\r\nwhen he whistled blithely and stuck a violet in his cap; there was the\r\nSynxon (St John) mart in the summer, round about St John the Baptist's\r\nDay, when he was hot and mopped his brow, and bought a roll of tawny\r\nsatin or Lucca silk for Katherine from a Genoese in a booth at Antwerp;\r\nand there was the Balms, or Bammys mart in the autumn, round about the\r\nday of St Rémy, whom the Flemings call St Bamis (October 28), when he\r\nwould buy her a fur of budge or mink, or a mantle of fine black shanks\r\nfrom the Hansards at their mart in Bruges. It was at these marts that\r\nthe Merchants of the Staple, jaunting about from place to place to meet\r\nbuyers for their wool, did a hundred little commissions for their\r\nfriends; for folk at home were apt to think that staplers existed to do\r\ntheir errands for them abroad and to send them presents. One wanted a\r\npair of Louvain gloves, the other a sugar loaf, the other a pipe of\r\nGascon wine ('You can get it cheaper over there, my dear'), the other a\r\nyard or two of Holland cloth; while ginger and saffron were always\r\nwelcome, and could be bought from the Venetians, whom the Celys spell\r\n'Whenysyans'. Then, of course, there were purchases to be made in the\r\nway of business, such as Calais packthread and canvas from Arras or\r\nBrittany or Normandy to pack the bales of wool.[65] As to the Celys,\r\nThomas Betson was wont to say that their talk was of nothing but sport\r\nand buying hawks, save on one gloomy occasion, when George Cely rode for\r\nten miles in silence and then confided to him that over in England his\r\ngrey bitch had whelped and had fourteen pups, and then died and the pups\r\nwith her.[66]\r\n\r\nBetween the counting-house in Calais and the fairs and marts of the\r\ncountry Thomas Betson would dispose of his wool and fells. But his\r\nlabour did not end here, for he would now have to embark upon the\r\ncomplicated business of collecting money from his customers, the Flemish\r\nmerchants, and with it paying his creditors in England, the Cotswold\r\nwool dealers. It was customary for the staplers to pay for their wool\r\nby bills due, as a rule, at six months, and Thomas Betson would be hard\r\nput to meet them if the foreign buyers delayed to pay him. Moreover, his\r\ndifficulties were inconceivably complicated by the exchanges. We think\r\nwe know something about the difficulty of divers and fluctuating\r\nexchanges today, but we can hardly imagine the elaborate calculations\r\nand the constant disputes which racked the brain of a Merchant of the\r\nStaple in the fifteenth century. Not only did the rates between England\r\nand the Continent constantly vary, but, as the editor of the _Cely\r\nPapers_ points out, 'the number of potentates of all kinds who claimed\r\nthe privilege of issuing their own coinage and the frequently suspicious\r\ncharacter of what they uttered as gold and silver, made the matter of\r\nadjustment of values difficult for the Celys, who were evidently obliged\r\nto take what they could get.'[67] Only imagine the difficulties of poor\r\nThomas Betson, when into his counting-house there wandered in turn the\r\nAndrew guilder of Scotland, the Arnoldus gulden of Gueldres (very much\r\ndebased), the Carolus groat of Charles of Burgundy, new crowns and old\r\ncrowns of France, the David and the Falewe of the Bishopric of Utrecht,\r\nthe Hettinus groat of the Counts of Westphalia, the Lewe or French Louis\r\nd'or, the Limburg groat, the Milan groat, the Nimueguen groat, the\r\nPhelippus or Philippe d'or of Brabant, the Plaques of Utrecht, the\r\nPostlates of various bishops, the English Ryall (worth ten shillings),\r\nthe Scots Rider or the Rider of Burgundy (so called because they bore\r\nthe figure of a man on horseback), the Florin Rhenau of the Bishopric of\r\nCologne and the Setillers.[68] He had to know the value in English money\r\nof them all, as it was fixed for the time being by the Fellowship, and\r\nmost of them were debased past all reason. Indeed, English money enjoyed\r\nan enviable good fame in this respect until Henry VIII began debasing\r\nthe coinage for his own nefarious ends. The letters of the Celys are\r\nfull of worried references to the exchange, and much we should pity\r\nThomas Betson. But doubtless he was like Chaucer's bearded merchant:\r\n'Wel koude he in exchaunge sheeldes [French crowns] selle.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VII. CALAIS ABOUT THE TIME OF THOMAS BETSON]\r\n\r\nTo effect their payments between England and the Netherlands the\r\nstaplers used to make use of the excellent banking facilities and\r\ninstruments of credit (bills of exchange and so forth), which were\r\nplaced at their disposal by Italian and Spanish merchants and by the\r\nEnglish mercers, all of whom combined trading with financial operations.\r\nThus we find William Cely writing to his masters:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIII. THOMAS PAYCOCKE'S HOUSE AT COGGESHALL]\r\n\r\nPlease your masterships to understand that I have received of John\r\nDelowppys upon payment of the bill, the which is sent me by Adlington\r\nbut £300 fleming, whereof I have paid to Gynott Strabant £84 _6s. 6d_.\r\nfleming. Item, I have made you over by exchange with Benynge Decasonn,\r\nLombard, 180 nobles sterling, payable at usance. I delivered it at _11s.\r\n2-1/2d_. fleming the noble, it amounteth £100 _17s. 6d_. fleming. Item,\r\nI have made you over by exchange in like wise with Jacob van de Base 89\r\nnobles and _6s_. sterling, payable at London at usuance in like wise; I\r\ndelivered it at _11s. 2d_. fleming for every noble sterling; it\r\namounteth fl.--£50 fleming and the rest of your £300 remains still by\r\nme, for I can make you over no more at this season, for here is no more\r\nthat will take any money as yet. And money goeth now upon the bourse at\r\n_11s. 3-1/2d_. the noble and none other money but Nimueguen groats,\r\ncrowns, Andrew guilders and Rhenish guilders, and the exchange goeth\r\never the longer worse and worse. Item, sir, I send you enclosed in this\r\nsaid letter, the two first letters of the payment of the exchange above\r\nwritten. Benynge Decasonn's letter is directed to Gabriel Defuye and\r\nPeter Sanly, Genoese, and Jacob van de Base's is directed to Anthony\r\nCarsy and Marcy Strossy, Spaniards; in Lombard Street ye shall hear\r\nof them.[69]\r\n\r\nA week later he writes:\r\n\r\nI understand your masterships hath taken up by exchange of John Raynold,\r\nmercer, £60 sterling, payable the 25th day of the month and of Deago\r\nDecastron [Diego da Castro, a Spaniard] other £60 sterling, payable the\r\n26th day of the same month, the which shall be both content at the day;\r\nand as for master Lewis More, Lombard, [he] is paid and I have the bill;\r\nhis attorney is a wrangling fellow--he would none other money but\r\nNimueguen groats.[70]\r\n\r\nMany a letter such as this must Thomas Betson have written at his\r\nlodgings, sitting so late over his work that he must needs write to his\r\nfriends when he ought to be sleeping and date his letters: 'At London,\r\non our Lady day in the night, when I deem ye were in your bed, for mine\r\neyne smarted, so God help me.'[71] And when he came to make up his\r\nannual accounts he had the hardest work of all to do. Here is a portrait\r\nof him at his labours:\r\n\r\nThe thridde day this marchant up ariseth,\r\nAnd on his nedes sadly hym avyseth,\r\nAnd up into his countour-hous gooth he,\r\nTo rekene with hymself, as wel may be,\r\nOf thilke yeer, how that it with hymn stood,\r\nAnd how that he despended hadde his good,\r\nAnd if that he encressed were or noon.\r\nHis bookes and his bagges, many oon,\r\nHe leith biform hymn on his countyng-bord.\r\nFul riche was his tresor and his hord,\r\nFor which ful faste his countour dore he shette;\r\nAnd eek he nolde that no man sholde hymn lette\r\nOf his accountes, for the meene tyme;\r\nAnd thus he sit til it was passed pry me.[72]\r\n\r\nThus was passed the life of a Merchant of the Staple: in riding to the\r\nCotswold farms for wool; in business at the counting-houses in Marks\r\nLane; in sailing from London to Calais and from Calais to London again;\r\nin dealing with merchant strangers at the mart in Calais, or riding to\r\nthe marts of Flanders in fair time. The great company sheltered him,\r\narranged his lodging, kept a sharp eye on the quality of his wool, made\r\nrules for his buying and selling, and saw that he had justice in its\r\ncourt. It was in this setting of hard and withal of interesting work\r\nthat Thomas Betson's love story flowered into a happy marriage. He was\r\nnot destined to live long after his recovery from the serious illness of\r\n1479; perhaps it left him permanently delicate, for he died some six\r\nyears later, in 1486. During her seven years of married life (beginning,\r\nbe it remembered, at the age of fifteen), the diligent Katherine had\r\nborne him five children, two sons, Thomas and John, and three daughters,\r\nElizabeth, Agnes, and Alice. Fortunately Thomas died very comfortably\r\noff, as his will (still preserved in Somerset House) informs us. He had\r\nbecome a member of the Fishmongers' Company as well as a Merchant of the\r\nStaple, for by his time the great city companies were no longer confined\r\nto persons actually engaged in the trade which each represented. In his\r\nwill[73] Thomas Betson leaves money for the repair of the roof loft in\r\nhis parish church of All Hallows, Barking, where he was buried, and\r\n'thirty pounds to the garnishing of the Staple Chapel in Our Lady Church\r\nat Calais, to buy some jewel', and twenty pounds to the\r\n'Stockfishmongers' to buy plate. He makes the latter company the\r\nguardian of his children, leaves his house to his wife, and a legacy of\r\n40_s_. to Thomas Henham, his colleague in Stonor's service, and\r\ncharacteristically gives directions 'for the costs of my burying to be\r\ndone not outrageously, but soberly and discreetly and in a mean\r\n[moderate, medium] manner, that it may be unto the worship and laud of\r\nAlmighty God.' Katherine, a widow with five children at the age of\r\ntwenty-two, married as her second husband William Welbech, haberdasher\r\n(the Haberdashers were a wealthy company), by whom she had another son.\r\nBut her heart stayed with the husband who wrote her her first playful\r\nlove-letter when she was a child, and on her death in 1510 she directed\r\nthat she should be laid by the side of Thomas Betson at All Hallows,\r\nBarking, where three staplers still lie beneath their brasses, although\r\nno trace of him remains.[74] There let them lie, long forgotten, and yet\r\nworthier of memory than many of the armoured knights who sleep under\r\ncarved sepulchres in our beautiful medieval churches.\r\n\r\n     The garlands wither on your brow;\r\n       Then boast no more your mighty deeds!\r\n     Upon Death's purple altar now\r\n       See where the victor-victim bleeds.\r\n         Your heads must come\r\n         To the cold tomb:\r\n     Only the actions of the just\r\n     Smell sweet and blossom in their dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_Thomas Paycocke of Coggeshall_\r\n\r\nAN ESSEX CLOTHIER IN THE DAYS OF HENRY VII\r\n\r\n     This was a gallant cloathier sure\r\n     Whose fame for ever shall endure.\r\n                 --THOMAS DELONEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great and noble trade of cloth-making has left many traces upon the\r\nlife of England, architectural, literary, and social. It has filled our\r\ncountryside with magnificent Perpendicular churches and gracious\r\noak-beamed houses. It has filled our popular literature with old wives'\r\ntales of the worthies of England, in which the clothiers Thomas of\r\nReading and Jack of Newbury rub elbows with Friar Bacon and Robin Hood.\r\nIt has filled our shires with gentlemen; for, as Defoe observed, in the\r\nearly eighteenth century 'many of the great families who now pass for\r\ngentry in the western counties have been originally raised from and\r\nbuilt up by this truly noble manufacture'. It has filled our census\r\nlists with surnames--Weaver, Webber, Webb, Sherman, Fuller, Walker,\r\nDyer--and given to every unmarried woman the designation of a spinster.\r\nAnd from the time when the cloth trade ousted that of wool as the chief\r\nexport trade of England down to the time when it was in its turn ousted\r\nby iron and cotton, it was the foundation of England's commercial\r\ngreatness. 'Among all Crafts,' says old Deloney, 'this was the only\r\nchief, for that it was the greatest merchandize, by the which our\r\nCountry became famous thorowout all Nations.'[1]\r\n\r\nAlready by the end of the fourteenth century the English clothiers were\r\nbeginning to rival those of the Netherlands in the making of fine cloth,\r\nas witness Chaucer's Wife of Bath:\r\n\r\nOf clooth-making she hadde swiche an haunt\r\nShe passed hem of Ypres and of Gaunt,\r\n\r\nand by the end of the sixteenth century all real rivalry was at an end,\r\nfor the English manufacture was so clearly victorious. With the\r\ndevelopment of the manufacture a change too took place in its\r\norganization. It had never been an easy industry to organize on a gild\r\nbasis, because the making of a piece of cloth entailed so many distinct\r\nprocesses. The preliminary processes of spinning and carding were always\r\nby-industries, performed by women and children in their cottages; but\r\nthe weavers, who bought the spun yarn, had their gild; and so had the\r\nfullers, who fulled it; and the shearmen, who finished it; and the dyers\r\nwho dyed it. All could not sell the finished piece of cloth, and in the\r\ngroup of inter-dependent crafts, each with its gild, we sometimes find\r\nthe weavers employing the fullers and sometimes the fullers the weavers.\r\nMoreover, since weaving is a much quicker process than spinning, the\r\nweaver often wasted much time and found it hard to collect enough yarn\r\nto keep his loom busy; and, as the market for cloth grew wider and was\r\nno longer confined to the town of the weaver, the need was felt for some\r\nmiddleman to specialize in the selling of the finished cloth. So by\r\ndegrees there grew up a class of men who bought wool in large quantities\r\nand sold it to the weavers, and then by a natural transition began, not\r\nto sell the wool outright, but to deliver it to the weavers to weave, to\r\nthe fullers to full, and to the shearmen to finish at a wage, receiving\r\nit back again when the work was done. These men grew rich; they amassed\r\ncapital; they could set many folk at work. Soon they began to set to\r\nwork all the different workers who combined to make a piece of cloth;\r\ntheir servants carried wool to the cottages for the women to card and\r\nspin; carried the spun yarn in turn to dyers, weavers, fullers,\r\nshearers; and carried the finished piece of cloth back to the industrial\r\nmiddleman--the clothier, as he was called--who in his turn disposed of\r\nit to the mercantile middleman, who was called a draper. The clothiers\r\ngrew rapidly in wealth and importance, and in certain parts of the\r\ncountry became the backbone of the middle class. They pursued their\r\nactivities in country villages, rather than in the old corporate towns,\r\nfor they wished to avoid the restrictions of the gilds, and gradually\r\nthe cloth industry migrated almost entirely to the country. In the west\r\nof England and in East Anglia (though not in Yorkshire) it was carried\r\nout by clothiers on this 'putting out' system, right up to the moment\r\nwhen the Industrial Revolution swept it out of the cottages into the\r\nfactories and out of the south into the north. Then the thriving\r\nvillages emptied themselves, so that today we must needs re-create again\r\nfrom scattered traces and old buildings, and still older names, the once\r\nfamiliar figures of the East Anglian clothier and his swarm of\r\nbusy workmen.\r\n\r\nSuch a familiar figure was once old Thomas Paycocke, clothier, of\r\nCoggeshall in Essex, who died full of years and honour in 1518. His\r\nfamily originally came from Clare, in Suffolk, but about the middle of\r\nthe fifteenth century a branch settled at Coggeshall, a village not far\r\ndistant. His grandfather and father would seem to have been grazing\r\nbutchers, but he and his brother and their descendants after them\r\nfollowed 'the truly noble manufacture' of cloth-making, and set an\r\nindelible mark upon the village where they dwelt. Coggeshall lies in the\r\ngreat cloth-making district of Essex, of which Fuller wrote: 'This\r\ncounty is charactered like Bethsheba, \"She layeth her hand to the\r\nspindle and her hands hold the distaffe.\"... It will not be amiss to\r\npray that the plough may go along and the wheel around, that so (being\r\nfed by the one and clothed by the other) there may be, by God's\r\nblessing, no danger of starving in our nation[2] All over Essex there\r\nlay villages famous for cloth-making, Coggeshall and Braintree, Bocking\r\nand Halstead, Shalford and Dedham, and above all Colchester, the great\r\ncentre and mart of the trade. The villages throve on the industry and\r\nthere was hardly a cottage which did not hum with the spinning wheel,\r\nand hardly a street where you might not have counted weavers' workshops,\r\nkitchens where the rough loom stood by the wall to occupy the goodman's\r\nworking hours. Hardly a week but the clatter of the pack-horse would be\r\nheard in the straggling streets, bringing in new stores of wool to be\r\nworked and taking away the pieces of cloth to the clothiers of\r\nColchester and the surrounding villages. Throughout the fifteenth\r\ncentury Coggeshall was an important centre, second only to the great\r\ntowns of Norwich, Colchester, and Sudbury, and to this day its two inns\r\nare called the 'Woolpack' and the 'Fleece.' We must, as I said, build up\r\nthe portrait of Thomas Paycocke and his compeers from scattered traces;\r\nbut happily such traces are common enough in many and many an English\r\nvillage, and in Coggeshall itself they lie ready to our hand. Out of\r\nthree things he can be brought to life again--to wit, his house in the\r\nvillage street, his family brasses in the aisle of the village church,\r\nand his will, which is preserved at Somerset House. A house, a brass, a\r\nwill--they seem little enough, but they hold all his history. It is the\r\ngreatest error to suppose that history must needs be something written\r\ndown; for it may just as well be something built up, and churches,\r\nhouses, bridges, or amphitheatres can tell their story as plainly as\r\nprint for those who have eyes to read. The Roman villa, excavated after\r\nlying lost for centuries beneath the heel of the unwitting\r\nploughboy--that villa with its spacious ground-plan, its floors rich\r\nwith mosaic patterns, its elaborate heating apparatus, and its shattered\r\nvases--brings home more clearly than any textbook the real meaning of\r\nthe Roman Empire, whose citizens lived like this in a foggy island at\r\nthe uttermost edge of its world. The Norman castle, with moat and\r\ndrawbridge, gatehouse and bailey and keep, arrow slits instead of\r\nwindows, is more eloquent than a hundred chronicles of the perils of\r\nlife in the twelfth century; not thus dwelt the private gentleman in the\r\ndays of Rome. The country manor-house of the fourteenth century, with\r\ncourtyard and chapel and hall and dovecote, speaks of an age of peace\r\nonce more, when life on a thousand little manors revolved round the\r\nlord, and the great mass of Englishmen went unscathed by the Hundred\r\nYears' War which seamed the fair face of France. Then begin the\r\nmerchants' elaborate Perpendicular houses in the towns and villages of\r\nthe fifteenth century, standing on the road, with gardens behind them,\r\nand carved beams, great fire-places, and a general air of comfort; they\r\nmark the advent of a new class in English history--the middle class,\r\nthrust between lord and peasant and coming to its own. How the spacious\r\ndays of great Elizabeth are mirrored in the beautiful Elizabethan\r\nhouses, with their wide wings and large rooms, their chimneys, their\r\nglass windows, looking outwards on to open parks and spreading trees,\r\ninstead of inwards on to the closed courtyard. Or go into a house built\r\nor redecorated in the eighteenth century, where you will see Chippendale\r\nchairs and lacquer tables and Chinese wall-papers covered with pagodas\r\nand mandarins; and surely there will come to your mind the age of the\r\nnabobs, the age which John Company had familiarized with the products of\r\nthe Far East, the age in which tea ousted coffee as the drink for a\r\ngentleman of fashion, in which Horace Walpole collected porcelain,\r\nOliver Goldsmith idealized China in 'The Citizen of the World', and Dr\r\nJohnson was called the Great Cham of Literature. Look here upon this\r\npicture and on this: look at that row of jerry-built houses, a hundred\r\nin a row and all exactly alike, of that new-art villa, all roof and\r\nhardly any window, with false bottle glass in its panes; here is the\r\ntwentieth century for you. Indeed all the social and very much of the\r\npolitical history of England may be reconstructed from her architecture\r\nalone; and so I make no apology for calling Thomas Paycocke's house\r\nfirst-rate historical evidence.\r\n\r\nOf much the same type, though less interesting, is the evidence of\r\nmonumental brasses, which are to be found in most parts of England and\r\nwhich abound in East Anglia, the Home Counties, and the Thames\r\nValley.[3] Their variety is magnificent; brasses of ecclesiastics in\r\nvestments, of doctors of law and divinity and masters of arts in\r\nacademic dress and of a few abbots and abbesses; brasses of knights in\r\nArmour; brasses of ladies, with their little dogs at their feet and\r\ndresses which show the changes in fashion from century to century and\r\nmake clear all the mysteries of kirtles and cotte-hardies, wimples and\r\npartlets and farthingales and the head-dresses appropriate to each\r\nsuccessive mode. The brasses also, like the houses, bear witness to the\r\nprosperity of the middle class, for in the fourteenth century when\r\nmerchants began to build themselves fine houses they began also to bury\r\nthemselves under splendid brasses. Finest of all, perhaps, are the\r\nbrasses of the wool staplers, with feet resting on woolpack or sheep;\r\nbut there are many other merchants too. Mayors and aldermen abound; they\r\nset their merchants' marks upon their tombs as proudly as gentlemen set\r\ntheir coats of arms, and indeed they had as great cause for pride. You\r\nmay see them at their proudest in the famous brass at Lynn, where Robert\r\nBraunch lies between his two wives, and at his feet is incised a scene\r\nrepresenting the feast at which he entertained Edward III royally and\r\nfeasted him on peacocks. There is a tailor with his shears, as glorious\r\nas the Crusader's sword, at Northleach, and a wine merchant with his\r\nfeet upon a wine cask at Cirencester. There are smaller folk, too, less\r\ndowered with wealth but proud enough of the implements of their craft;\r\ntwo or three public notaries with penhorn and pencase complete, a\r\nhuntsman with his horn, and in Newland Church one of the free miners of\r\nthe Forest of Dean, cap and leather breeches tied below the knee, wooden\r\nmine-hod over shoulder, a small mattock in his right hand, and a\r\ncandlestick between his teeth. This kind of historical evidence will\r\nhelp us with Thomas Paycocke. His family brasses were set in the north\r\naisle of the parish church of St Peter Ad Vincula. Several of them have\r\ndisappeared in the course of the last century and a half, and unluckily\r\nno brass of Thomas himself survives; but in the aisle there still lie\r\ntwo--the brass of his brother John, who died in 1533, and John's wife,\r\nand that of his nephew, another Thomas, who died in 1580; the merchant's\r\nmark may still be seen thereon.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is the evidence of the Paycocke wills, of which three are\r\npreserved at Somerset House--the will of John Paycocke _(d._ 1505),\r\nThomas's father and the builder of the house; the will of Thomas\r\nPaycocke himself _(d._ 1518); and the will of his nephew Thomas, the\r\nsame whose brass lies in the aisle and who left a long and splendidly\r\ndetailed testament, full of information upon local history and the\r\norganization of the cloth industry. For social historians have as yet\r\nhardly, perhaps, made as much use as they might of the evidence of\r\nwills. The enormous amount of miscellaneous information to be derived\r\ntherefrom about the life of our forefathers can hardly be believed, save\r\nby those who have turned the pages of such a collection as the great\r\n_Testamenta Eboracensia_.[4] In wills you may see how many daughters a\r\nman could dower and how many he put into a nunnery, and what education\r\nhe provided for his sons. You may note which were the most popular\r\nreligious houses, and which men had books and what the books were, how\r\nmuch of their money they thought fit to leave for charitable purposes,\r\nand what they thought of the business capacity of their wives. You may\r\nread long and dazzling lists of family plate, all the favourite cups and\r\ndishes having pet names of their own, and of rings and brooches and\r\nbelts and rosaries. There are detailed descriptions of dresses and\r\nfurs, sometimes splendid, sometimes ordinary, for people handed on\r\ntheir rich clothes as carefully as their jewels. There are even more\r\nwonderful descriptions of beds, with all their bedclothes and hangings,\r\nfor a bed was a very valuable article of furniture and must often,\r\njudging from the wills, have been a brilliant and beautiful object\r\nindeed; Shakespeare has earned a great deal of unmerited obloquy for\r\nleaving Ann Hathaway his second-best bed, though it is not to be denied\r\nthat he might have left her his first-best. Even more beautiful than\r\ndressings and bed or chamber hangings are the brocaded and embroidered\r\nvestments mentioned in wills, and the elaborate arrangements for funeral\r\nceremonies are extremely interesting. The wills are of all kinds; there\r\nare even villeins' wills, though in theory the villein's possessions\r\nwere his lord's, and there are wills of kings and queens, lords and\r\nladies, bishops and parsons and lawyers and shopkeepers. Here also is\r\nmore evidence for the social prosperity of the middle class, details of\r\ntheir trade, the contents of their shops, the inventories of their\r\nhouses, their estates (sometimes) in the country, their house rents\r\n(almost always) in the town, their dressers garnished with plate and\r\ntheir wives' ornaments, their apprentices and their gilds, their\r\nphilanthropy, their intermarriage with the gentry, their religious\r\nopinions. Such a living picture do men's wills give us of their\r\ndaily lives.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are the three sources from which the life and times of\r\nThomas Paycocke may be drawn. All three--houses, brasses, and\r\nwills--contain much evidence for the increasingly rapid growth during\r\nthe last two centuries of the Middle Ages of a large and prosperous\r\nmiddle class, whose wealth was based not upon landed property but upon\r\nindustry and trade. It is a class of whom we have already met typical\r\nexamples in Thomas Betson and the anonymous Ménagier de Paris, and we\r\nmust now see what his house, his will, and his family brasses tell us\r\nabout the clothier Thomas Paycocke. First and foremost, they tell us a\r\ngreat deal about the noble industry which supported him. Paycocke's\r\nhouse is full of relics of the cloth industry. The merchant mark of the\r\nPaycockes, an ermine tail, looking like a two-stemmed clover leaf, is to\r\nbe found on the carved beams of the chimney, on the breastsummers of the\r\nfire-places, and set in the midst of the strip of carving along the\r\nfront of the house. Thomas marked his bales of cloth thus, and what\r\nother armorial bearings did he need? The whole house is essentially\r\nmiddle class-the house of a man who was _nouveau riche_ in an age when\r\nto be _nouveau riche_ was not yet to be vulgar. His prosperity has\r\nblossomed out into exquisitely ornate decoration. A band of carving runs\r\nalong the front of the house, and from the curved stem of it branch out\r\na hundred charming devices--leaves, tendrils, strange flowers, human\r\nheads, Tudor roses, a crowned king and queen lying hand in hand, a baby\r\ndiving with a kick of fat legs into the bowl of an arum lily, and in the\r\nmidst the merchant's mark upon a shield and the initials of the master\r\nof the house. In the hall is a beautiful ceiling of carved oakwork,\r\nexceedingly elaborate and bearing at intervals the merchant's mark\r\nagain. Upstairs in the big bedchamber is a ceiling of beams worked in\r\nbold roll mouldings; and there is an exquisite little parlour, lined\r\nwith linen fold panels, with a breastsummer carved with strange animals.\r\nThis elaboration is characteristic. It is all of a piece with Coggeshall\r\nChurch, and with all those other spacious East Anglian churches,\r\nLavenham, Long Melford, Thaxted, Saffron Walden, Lynn, Snettisham, lofty\r\nand spacious, which the clothiers built out of their newly won wealth.\r\nThe very architecture is characteristic, _nouveau riche_ again, like\r\nthose who paid for it, the elaborate ornament and sumptuous detail of\r\nthe Perpendicular taking the place of the simple majesty of the Early\r\nEnglish style. It is just the sort of architecture that a merchant with\r\na fortune would pay for. The middle class liked some show for its money;\r\nbut again it was the ostentation without the vulgarity of wealth.\r\nLooking upon his beautiful house, or worshipping beside his family\r\ntombs, with the merchant's mark on the brasses, in St Katherine's aisle,\r\nThomas Paycocke must often have blessed the noble industry which\r\nsupported him.\r\n\r\nThe wills of the Paycockes tell the same story. To whom beside his\r\nfamily does Thomas leave legacies but the good folk of the\r\nneighbourhood, who worked for him. There is the Goodday family of\r\ncheerful name, two of whom were shearmen, or cloth finishers, and had\r\nsubstantial gifts. 'I bequeth to Thomas Goodday Sherman xx s. and ych of\r\nhis childryn iij s. iiij d. apece. Item, I bequeth to Edward Goodday\r\nSherman xvj s. viij d., and to his child iij s. iiij d. He also left\r\nmoney to Robert Goodday of Sampford and to Robert's brother John and to\r\neach of Robert's sisters, with something extra for Grace, who was his\r\ngoddaughter; and he did not forget Nicholas Goodday of Stisted and\r\nRobert Goodday of Coggeshall and their families, nor their relative\r\nJohn, who was a priest and had ten shillings for a trental. All these\r\nGooddays were doubtless bound to Thomas Paycocke by ties of work as well\r\nas of friendship. They belonged to a well-known Coggeshall family, for\r\ngenerations connected with the cloth industry. Thomas Paycocke's\r\nnamesake and grand-nephew, whose will is dated 1580, was still in close\r\nrelations with them, and left 'to Edwarde Goodaye my godson Fourtie\r\nshillinges and to every brother and sister the saide Edwarde hath\r\nlivinge at the tyme of my decease tenne shillinges a pece,' and 'unto\r\nWilliam Gooday thelder tenne shillinges.' The hurrying, scattering\r\ngeneration of today can hardly imagine the immovable stability of the\r\nvillage of past centuries, when generation after generation grew from\r\ncradle to grave in the same houses, on the same cobbled streets, and\r\nfolk of the same name were still friends, as their fathers and\r\ngrandfathers had been before them.\r\n\r\nOther friends and employees of Thomas Paycocke also had their legacies.\r\nHe leaves _6s. 8d_. to Humphrey Stonor, 'somtyme my prentis'. We may see\r\nHumphrey Stonor, with sleepy eyes, making his way downstairs on a frosty\r\nmorning, from those huge raftered attics, where perhaps the 'prentices\r\nused to sleep. He was on terms of impudent friendship, no doubt, with\r\nthe weavers and fullers whom his master set to work; withal a young man\r\nof good family, a relative perchance of those Stonors for whom Thomas\r\nBetson worked, for, as Deloney wrote, 'the yonger sons of knights and\r\ngentlemen, to whom their Fathers would leave no lands, were most\r\ncommonly preferred to learn this trade, to the end that thereby they\r\nmight live in good estate and drive forth their days in prosperity.' Two\r\nof his friends got substantial legacies; apparently Thomas Paycocke had\r\nlent them money and wished to wipe out the debt upon his death-bed, for,\r\nsays the will, 'I bequethe to John Beycham, my weyver, v li and [i.e.\r\nif] there be so moch bitwene vs and ells to make it vp v li, and a gowne\r\nand a doublett.... I bequeth and forgive Robert Taylor, fuller, all that\r\nis betwixt vs, and more I give him iij s. iiij d.' Other legacies show\r\neven more clearly that his operations were on a larger scale. 'I bequeth\r\nto all my wevers, ffullers and shermen that be not afore Rehersed by\r\nname xij d. apece, And will they that have wrought me verey moch wark\r\nhave iij s. iiij d. apece. Item, I bequethe to be distributed amonge my\r\nKembers, Carders and Spynners summa iiij li.'[5] Here are all the\r\nbranches of the cloth industry at a glance. It is Thomas Paycocke,\r\nclothier, round whom the whole manufacture revolves. He gives the wool\r\nto the women to comb it and card it and spin it; he receives it from\r\nthem again and gives it to the weaver to be woven into cloth; he gives\r\nthe cloth to the fuller to be fulled and the dyer to be dyed; and having\r\nreceived it when finished, he has it made up into dozens and sends it\r\noff to the wholesale dealer, the draper, who sells it; perhaps he has\r\nbeen wont to send it to that very 'Thomas Perpoint, draper' whom he\r\ncalls 'my cosyn' and makes his executor. The whole of Thomas Paycocke's\r\ndaily business is implicit in his will. In the year of his death he was\r\nstill employing a large number of workers and was on friendly and\r\nbenevolent terms with them. The building of his house had not signalized\r\nhis retirement from business, as happened when another great clothier,\r\nThomas Dolman, gave up cloth-making and the weavers of Newbury went\r\nabout lamenting:\r\n\r\nLord have mercy upon us, miserable sinners.\r\nThomas Dolman has built a new house and turned away all his\r\nspinners.[6]\r\n\r\nThe relations between Paycocke and his employees evinced in his will are\r\nhappy ones. Such was not always the case, for if the clothiers of this\r\nage had some of the virtues of capitalists, they also had many of their\r\nvices, and the age-old strife of capital and labour was already well\r\nadvanced in the fifteenth century. One detail Paycocke's will does not\r\ngive us, which we should be glad to know: did he employ only domestic\r\nweavers, working in their own houses, or did he also keep a certain\r\nnumber of looms working in his house? It was characteristic of the\r\nperiod in which he lived that something like a miniature factory system\r\nwas establishing itself in the midst of the new outwork system. The\r\nclothiers were beginning to set up looms in their own houses and to work\r\nthem by journeymen weavers; as a rule the independent weavers greatly\r\ndisliked the practice, for either they were forced from the position of\r\nfree masters into that of hired servants, obliged to go and work in the\r\nclothier's loom shop, or else they found their payment forced down by\r\nthe competition of the journeymen. Moreover, the clothiers sometimes\r\nowned and let out looms to their work-people, and then also part of the\r\nindustrial independence of the weaver was lost. All through the first\r\nhalf of the sixteenth century the weavers in the cloth districts kept on\r\npetitioning Parliament against this new evil of capitalism. It was as\r\nthough, long before it established itself in England they had a\r\nprevision of the factory system and of the worker no longer owning\r\neither his raw material, his tool, his workshop, or the produce of his\r\nindustry, but only his labour; the master-weaver dwindled to a hired\r\nhand. Certainly the practice was growing in Essex, where, some twenty\r\nyears after Thomas Paycocke's death, the weavers petitioned against the\r\nclothiers, who had their own looms and weavers and fullers in their own\r\nhouses, so that the petitioners were rendered destitute; 'for the rich\r\nmen, the clothiers, be concluded and agreed among themselves to hold and\r\npay one price for weaving the said cloths,' a price too small to support\r\ntheir households, even if they worked day and night, holiday and\r\nwork-day, so that many of them lost their independence and were reduced\r\nto become other men's servants.[7] Nevertheless, the outwork system\r\nremained the more common, and without doubt the majority of Paycocke's\r\nworkers lived in their own cottages, though it is probable also that he\r\nhad some looms in his house, perhaps in the long, low room at the back,\r\nwhich is traditionally supposed to have been used for weaving, perhaps\r\nin a shed or 'spinning house'.\r\n\r\nA highly idyllic picture of work in one of these miniature factories,\r\nwhich we may amuse ourselves by applying to Thomas Paycocke's, is\r\ncontained in Deloney's _Pleasant History of Jack of Newbery._ Jack of\r\nNewbury was an historical character, a very famous clothier named John\r\nWinchcomb who died at Newbury only a year later than Paycocke himself,\r\nand of whom Paycocke must certainly have heard, for his kersies were\r\nfamous on the Continent, and old Fuller, who celebrates him among his\r\n_Worthies of England_ calls him 'the most considerable clothier (without\r\nfancy or fiction) England ever beheld'.[8] The tales of how he had led\r\na hundred of his own 'prentices to Flodden Field, how he had feasted the\r\nKing and Queen in his house at Newbury, how he had built part of Newbury\r\nChurch, and how he had refused a knighthood, preferring 'to rest in his\r\nrusset coat a poor clothier to his dying day,' spread about England,\r\ngrowing as they spread. In 1597 Thomas Deloney, the forefather of the\r\nnovel, enshrined them in a rambling tale, half prose and half verse,\r\nwhich soon became extremely popular. It is from this tale that we may\r\ntake an imaginary picture of work in a clothier's house, being wary to\r\nremember, however, that it is an exaggeration, a legend, and that the\r\ngreat John Winchcomb certainly never had as many as two hundred looms in\r\nhis own house, while our Thomas Paycocke probably had not more than a\r\ndozen. But the poet must have his licence, for, after all, the spirit of\r\nthe ballad is the thing, and it is always a pleasant diversion to drop\r\ninto rhyme:\r\n\r\nWithin one roome, being large and long\r\nThere stood two hundred Loomes full strong.\r\nTwo hundred men, the truth is so,\r\nWrought in these Loomes all in a row.\r\nBy every one a pretty boy\r\nSate making quilts with mickle joy,\r\nAnd in another place hard by\r\nA hundred women merily\r\nWere carding hard with joy full cheere\r\nWho singing sate with voyces cleere,\r\nAnd in a chamber close beside\r\nTwo hundred maidens did abide,\r\nIn petticoats of Stammell red,\r\nAnd milk white kerchers on their head.\r\nTheir smocke-sleeves like to winter snow\r\nThat on the Westerne mountaines flow,\r\nAnd each sleeve with a silken band\r\nWas featly tied at the hand.\r\nThese pretty maids did never lin\r\nBut in that place all day did spin,\r\nAnd spinning so with voyces meet\r\nLike nightingales they sang full sweet.\r\nThen to another roome came they\r\nWhere children were in poore aray;\r\nAnd every one sate picking wool\r\nThe finest from the course to cull:\r\nThe number was sevenscore and ten\r\nThe children of poore silly men:\r\nAnd these their labours to requite\r\nHad every one a penny at night,\r\nBeside their meat and drinke all day,\r\nWhich was to them a wondrous stay.\r\nWithin another place likewise\r\nFull fifty proper men he spies\r\nAnd these were sheremen everyone,\r\nWhose skill and cunning there was showne:\r\nAnd hard by them there did remaine\r\nFull four-score rowers taking paine.\r\nA Dye-house likewise had he then,\r\nWherein he kept full forty men:\r\nAnd likewise in his Fulling Mill\r\nFull twenty persons kept he still.\r\nEach weeke ten good fat oxen he\r\nSpent in his house for certaintie,\r\nBeside good butter, cheese and fish\r\nAnd many another wholesome dish.\r\nHe kept a Butcher all the yeere,\r\nA Brewer eke for Ale and Beere;\r\nA Baker for to bake his Bread,\r\nWhich stood his hushold in good stead.\r\nFive Cookes within his kitchin great\r\nWere all the yeare to dress his meat.\r\nSix Scullion boyes vnto their hands,\r\nTo make clean dishes, pots and pans,\r\nBeside poore children that did stay\r\nTo turne the broaches every day.\r\nThe old man that did see this sight\r\nWas much amaz'd, as well he might:\r\nThis was a gallant Cloathier sure,\r\nWhose fame forever shall endure.[9]\r\n\r\nThe private life of Thomas Paycocke, no less than his business, can be\r\nmade to live again. Of his family the invaluable will tells us a\r\nlittle. His first wife was that Margaret whose initials, together with\r\nhis own, decorate the woodwork of the house, and indeed it is probable\r\nthat old John Paycocke built the house for the young couple on their\r\nwedding. Gay, indeed, must have been the sights which it witnessed on\r\nthat happy day, for our ancestors knew how to put their hearts into a\r\nwedding, and Merry England was never merrier then when the bridegroom\r\nled home the bride. We may borrow once again from Deloney's idyll, to\r\nrecreate the scene:\r\n\r\n     The Bride being attyred in a gowne of sheepes russet and a\r\n     kertle of fine woosted, her head attyred with a billiment of\r\n     gold and her haire as yeallow as gold hanging downe behinde\r\n     her, which was curiously combed and pleated, according to the\r\n     manner in those dayes; shee was led to Church betweene two\r\n     sweete boyes, with Bridelaces and Rosemary tied about their\r\n     silken sleeves. Then was there a fair Bride-cup of silver and\r\n     gilt carried before her, wherein was a goodly branch of\r\n     Rosemary gilded very faire, hung about with silken Ribands of\r\n     all colours; next was there a noyse of Musicians that played\r\n     all the way before her; after her came all the chiefest\r\n     maydens of the Country, some bearing great Bride Cakes and\r\n     some Garlands of wheate finely gilded and so she past unto\r\n     the Church. It is needlesse for mee to make any mention here\r\n     of the Bridegroome, who being a man so well beloued, wanted\r\n     no company and those of the best sort, beside diuers Marchant\r\n     strangers of the Stillyard that came from London to the\r\n     wedding. The marriage being solemnized, home they came in\r\n     order as before and to dinner they went where was no want of\r\n     good cheare, no lack of melody.... The wedding endured ten\r\n     dayes, to the great reliefe of the poore that dwelt all\r\n     about.[10]\r\n\r\nMuch dancing the house doubtless saw under the beautiful carved roof of\r\nthe hall, with much song, games, kissing, and general abandon. Even when\r\nthe bride and groom retired to the bridal chamber with its roll-moulded\r\nbeams the merry-making was not done; they must hold a levee to their\r\nnearest friends in the bedchamber itself, enthroned in the great\r\nfour-poster bed. There was no false delicacy about our ancestors.\r\nIndeed, as Henry Bullinger says (he was a very different person from\r\njovial Deloney, but he was a contemporary of Paycocke's, and Coverdale\r\ntranslated him, so let him speak): 'After supper must they begynne to\r\npype and daunce agayne of the new. And though the yonge parsones,\r\nbeynge weery of the bablyng noyse and inconuenience, come ones towarde\r\ntheyer rest, yet can they haue no quietnesse. For a man shall fynd\r\nunmanerly and restlesse people, that will first go to theyr chambre\r\ndore, and there syng vycious and naughtie balates that the deuell maye\r\nhaue his triumphe now to the vttermost.'[11] What would we not give for\r\none of those 'naughty ballads' today?\r\n\r\nThe bride Margaret, who was somewhat after this merry fashion brought\r\nhome to Coggeshall, came from Clare, the ancient home of the Coggeshall\r\nPaycockes. She was the daughter of one Thomas Horrold, for whose memory\r\nPaycocke retained a lively affection and respect, for in founding a\r\nchantry in Coggeshall Church he desired specially that it should be for\r\nthe souls of himself and his wife, his mother and father, and his\r\nfather-in-law, Thomas Horrold of Clare. He also left five pounds, with\r\nwhich his executors were 'to purvey an oder stone to be hade to Clare\r\nchirch and layd on my ffader in lawe Thomas Horrold w't his pycture and\r\nhis wife and childryn thereon' (i.e. a memorial brass), and also five\r\ncows or else three pounds in money to Clare Church 'to kepe and mayntene\r\nmy ffader in lawe Thomas Horrold his obitt'. He also left money to his\r\nwife's brother and sisters. Margaret Paycocke died before her husband\r\nand without children; and the only young folk of his name whom Thomas\r\never saw at play in his lofty hall, or climbing upon his dresser to find\r\nthe head, as small as a walnut, hidden in the carving of the ceiling,\r\nwere his nephews and nieces, Robert and Margaret Uppcher, his sister's\r\nchildren; John, the son of his brother John; and Thomas, Robert, and\r\nEmma, the children of his brother Robert; perhaps also his little\r\ngodchild Grace Goodday. It was perhaps in the hope of a son to whom he\r\nmight leave his house and name that Thomas Paycocke married again a girl\r\ncalled Ann Cotton. She was the wife of his old age, 'Anne my good wif',\r\nand her presence must have made bright the beautiful house, silent and\r\nlonely since Margaret died. Her father, George Cotton, is mentioned in\r\nthe will, and her brothers and sister, Richard, William, and Eleanor,\r\nhave substantial legacies. But Thomas and Ann enjoyed only a short term\r\nof married life; she brought him his only child, but death overtook him\r\nbefore it was born. In his will he provides carefully for Ann; she is\r\nto have five hundred marks sterling, and as long as she lives the\r\nbeautiful house is to be hers; for to his elaborate arrangements for its\r\ninheritance he adds, 'provided alwey that my wif Ann haue my house that\r\nI dwell in while she lyvyth at hir pleyser and my dof house [dove-house]\r\nwith the garden y't stoundeth in.' A gap in the Paycocke records makes\r\nit difficult to say whether Thomas Paycocke's child lived or died; but\r\nit seems probable that it either died or was a girl, for Paycocke had\r\nbequeathed the house, provided that he had no male heirs, to his nephew\r\nJohn (son of his eldest brother John), and in 1575 we find it in the\r\nhands of this John Paycocke, while the house next door was in the hands\r\nof another Thomas Paycocke, his brother Robert's son. This Thomas died\r\nabout 1580, leaving only daughters, and after him, in 1584, died John\r\nPaycocke, sadly commemorated in the parish register as 'the last of his\r\nname in Coxall'. So the beautiful house passed out of the hands of the\r\ngreat family of clothiers who had held it for nearly a hundred\r\nyears.[12]\r\n\r\nOf Thomas Paycocke's personal character it is also possible to divine\r\nsomething from his will. He was obviously a kind and benevolent\r\nemployer, as his thought for his work-people and their children shows.\r\nHe was often asked to stand godfather to the babies of Coggeshall, for\r\nin his will he directs that at his burial and the ceremonies which were\r\nrepeated on the seventh day and 'month mind' after it there were to be\r\n'xxiiij or xij smale childryn in Rochettes with tapers in theire hands\r\nand as many as may be of them lett them be my god childryn and they to\r\nhave vj s. viij d. apece and euery oder child iiij d. apece ... and also\r\neuery god chyld besyde vj s. viij d. apece.' All these children were\r\nprobably little bread-winners, employed at a very early age in sorting\r\nThomas Paycocke's wool. 'Poore people,' says Thomas Deloney, 'whom God\r\nlightly blessed with most children, did by meanes of this occupation so\r\norder them, that by the time they were come to be sixe or seven yeeres\r\nof age, they were able to get their owne bread';[13] and when Defoe rode\r\nfrom Blackstone Edge to Halifax, observing the cloth manufacture, which\r\noccupied all the villages of the West Riding, it was one of his chief\r\ngrounds for admiration that 'all [were] employed from the youngest to\r\nthe oldest; scarce any thing above four years old, but its hands were\r\nsufficient for its own support.'[14] The employment of children at what\r\nwe should regard as an excessively early age was by no means a new\r\nphenomenon introduced with the Industrial Revolution.\r\n\r\nThat Thomas Paycocke had many friends, not only in Coggeshall but in the\r\nvillages round, the number of his legacies bears witness. His will also\r\nshows that he was a man of deep religious feeling. He was a brother of\r\nthe Crutched Friars of Colchester and left them on his death five pounds\r\nto pray 'for me and for them that I am bound to pray fore'. It was\r\ncustomary in the Middle Ages for monastic houses to give the privilege\r\nof the fraternity of the house to benefactors and persons of\r\ndistinction; the reception took place at a long and elaborate ceremony,\r\nduring which the _consrater_ received the kiss of peace from all the\r\nbrethren. It is a mark of the respect in which Thomas Paycocke was held\r\nin the countryside that he should have been made a brother by the\r\nCrutched Friars. He seems to have had a special kindness for the Order\r\nof Friars; he left the Grey Friars of Colchester and the Friars of\r\nMaldon, Chelmsford, and Sudbury each ten shillings for a trental and 3s.\r\n4d. to repair their houses; and to the Friars of Clare he left twenty\r\nshillings for two trentals, 'and at Lent after my deceste a kade of Red\r\nheryng'. He had great interest in Coggeshall Abbey; it lay less than a\r\nmile from his house, and he must often have dined in state with the\r\nabbot at his guest table on feast days and attended Mass in the abbey\r\nchurch. He remembered the abbey as he lay dying, and the sound of its\r\nbells ringing for vespers came softly in at his window on the mellow\r\nSeptember air; and he left 'my Lord Abbot and Convent' one of his famous\r\nbroadcloths and four pounds in money 'for to have a dirige and Masse and\r\ntheir belles Ryngyng at my buriall when it is doon at Chirche, lykewyse\r\nthe vijth day and mounth day, with iij tryntalls upon the same day yf\r\nthey can serve them, orells when they can at more leasur, Summa x li.'\r\n\r\nHis piety is shown also in his bequests to the churches of Bradwell,\r\nPattiswick, and Markshall, parishes adjacent to Coggeshall, and to Stoke\r\nNayland, Clare, Poslingford, Ovington, and Beauchamp St Pauls, over the\r\nEssex order, in the district from which the Paycockes originally came.\r\nBut his greatest care was naturally for Coggeshall Church. One of the\r\nPaycockes had probably built the north aisle, where the altar was\r\ndedicated to St Katherine, and all the Paycocke tombs lay there. Thomas\r\nPaycocke left instructions in his will that he should be buried before\r\nSt Katherine's altar, and made the following gifts to the church: 'Item,\r\nI bequeth to the high aulter of Coxhall Chirche in recompence of tithes\r\nand all oder thyngs forgoten, Summa iiij li. Item, I bequethe to the\r\nTabernacle of the Trenyte at the high awlter and an other of Seint\r\nMargarete in seint Katryne Ile, there as the great Lady stands, for\r\ncarvyng and gildyng of them summa c. marcs sterlinge. Item, to the\r\nreparacons of the Chirch and bells and for my lying in the Chirche summa\r\nc. nobles.' He founded a chantry there also and left money to be given\r\nweekly to six poor men to attend Mass in his chantry thrice a week.\r\n\r\nOf piety and of family pride these legacies to religious houses and to\r\nchurches speak clearly. Another series of legacies, which takes a form\r\ncharacteristic of medieval charity, bears witness perhaps to Thomas\r\nPaycocke's habits. He must often have ridden abroad, to see the folk who\r\nworked for him or to visit his friends in the villages round Coggeshall;\r\nor farther afield to Clare, first to see the home of his ancestors, then\r\nto court Margaret Horrold, his bride, and then, with Margaret beside\r\nhim, to visit his well-loved father-in-law. Certainly, whether he walked\r\nto church in Coggeshall, or whether he rode along the country lanes, he\r\noften sighed over the state of the road as he went; often he must have\r\nstruggled through torrents of mud in winter or stumbled among holes in\r\nsummer; for in the Middle Ages the care of the roads was a matter for\r\nprivate or ecclesiastical charity, and all except the great highways\r\nwere likely to be but indifferently kept. Langland, in his _Piers\r\nPlowman_, mentions the amending of 'wikked wayes' (by which he means not\r\nbad habits but bad roads) as one of those works of charity which rich\r\nmerchants must do for the salvation of their souls. Thomas Paycocke's\r\nchoice of roads no doubt reflects many a wearisome journey, from which\r\nhe returned home splashed and testy, to the ministrations of 'John\r\nReyner my man' or 'Henry Briggs my servant', and of Margaret, looking\r\nanxiously from her oriel window for his return. In his own town he\r\nleaves no less than forty pounds, of which twenty pounds was to go to\r\namend a section of West Street (where his house stood), and the other\r\ntwenty was 'to be layde on the fowle wayes bitwene Coxhall and\r\nBlackwater where as moost nede ys'; he had doubtless experienced the\r\nevils of this road on his way to the abbey. Farther afield, he leaves\r\ntwenty pounds for the 'fowle way' between Clare and Ovington, and\r\nanother twenty for the road between Ovington and Beauchamp St Pauls.\r\n\r\nAs his life drew to its close he doubtless rode less often afield. The\r\ndays would pass peacefully for him; his business flourished and he was\r\neverywhere loved and respected. He took pride in his lovely house,\r\nadding bit by bit to its beauties. In the cool of the evening he must\r\noften have stood outside the garden room and seen the monks from the big\r\nabbey fishing in their stewpond across the field, or lifted his eyes to\r\nwhere the last rays of sun slanted on to the lichened roof of the great\r\ntithebarn, and on to the rows of tenants, carrying their sheaves of corn\r\nalong the road; and he reflected, perhaps, that John Mann and Thomas\r\nSpooner, his own tenants, were good, steady friends, and that it was\r\nwell to leave them a gown or a pound when he died. Often also, in his\r\nlast year or two, he must have sat with his wife in his garden with the\r\ndove-house and watched the white pigeons circling round the apple-trees,\r\nand smiled upon her bed of flowers. And in winter evenings sometimes he\r\nwould take his furred cloak and stroll to the Dragon Inn, and Edward\r\nAylward, mine host, would welcome him with bows; and so he would sit and\r\ndrink a tankard of sack with his neighbours, very slow and dignified, as\r\nbefitted the greatest clothier of the town, and looking benevolently\r\nupon the company. But at times he would frown, if he saw a truant monk\r\nfrom the abbey stolen out for a drink in spite of all the prohibitions\r\nof bishop and abbot, shaking his head, perhaps, and complaining that\r\nreligion was not what it had been in the good old days; but not meaning\r\nmuch of it, as his will shows, and never dreaming that twenty years\r\nafter his death abbot and monks would be scattered and the King's\r\nservants would be selling at auction the lead from off the roof of\r\nCoggeshall Abbey; never dreaming that after four hundred years his house\r\nwould still stand, mellow and lovely, with its carved ceiling and its\r\nproud merchant's mark, when the abbey church was only a shadow on the\r\nsurface of a field in hot weather and all the abbey buildings were\r\nshrunk to one ruined ambulatory, ignobly sheltering blue Essex hay\r\nwagons from the rain.\r\n\r\nSo Thomas Paycocke's days drew to a close amid the peace and beauty of\r\nthe most English of counties, 'fatt, frutefull and full of profitable\r\nthinges,'[15] whose little rolling hills, wych elms, and huge clouded\r\nskies Constable loved to paint. There came a day in September when gloom\r\nhung over the streets of Coggeshall, when the spinning-wheels were\r\nsilent in the cottages, and spinners and weavers stood in anxious groups\r\noutside the beautiful house in West Street; for upstairs in his bridal\r\nchamber, under its noble ceiling, the great clothier lay dying, and his\r\nwife wept by his bedside, knowing that he would never see his child. A\r\nfew days later the cottages were deserted again, and a concourse of\r\nweeping people followed Thomas Paycocke to his last rest. The ceremony\r\nof his burial befitted his dignity: it comprised services, not only on\r\nburial day itself, but on the seventh day after it, and then again after\r\na month had passed. It is given best in the words of his will, for\r\nThomas Paycocke followed the custom of his time, in giving his executors\r\nelaborate injunctions for his funeral rites: 'I will myne executors\r\nbestowe vpon my buryng daye, vij day and mounthe daye after this manner:\r\nAt my buriall to have a tryntall of prests and to be at dirige, lawdis,\r\nand comendacons as many of them as may be purveyed that day to serve the\r\ntryntall, and yf eny lack to make it vpp the vij'th daye. And at the\r\nMounthe daye an oder tryntall to be purveyed hoole of myne executors and\r\nto kepe dirige, lawdis and commendacons as is afore reherssed, with iij\r\nhigh massis be note [by note, i.e. with music], oon of the holy gost, an\r\nother of owre lady, and an other of Requiem, both buriall, seuenth day\r\nand Mounthe daye. And prests beyng at this obseruance iiij d. at euery\r\ntyme and childryn at euery tyme ij d., w't torches at the buriall xij,\r\nand vj at the vij'th day and xij at the mounthe daye, with xxiij'th or\r\nxij smale childryn in Rochettes with tapers in theire honds, and as many\r\nas may be of them lett them be my god Childryn, and they to haue vj s.\r\nviij d. apece; and euery oder child iiij d. apece; and euery man that\r\nholdith torches at euery day he to have ij apece; and euery man, woman\r\nand child that holdeth upp hound [hand] at eny of thes iij days to haue\r\nj d. apece; And also euery god chyld besyde vj s. viij d. apece; and to\r\nthe Ryngars for all iij dayes x s.; and for mete, drynke, and for twoo\r\nSemones of a doctor, and also to haue a dirige at home, or I be borne to\r\nthe Chirche summa j li.'\r\n\r\nHere is something very different from the modest Thomas Betson's\r\ninjunction: 'The costes of my burying to be don not outrageously, but\r\nsobrely and discretly and in a meane maner, that it may be unto the\r\nworship and laude of Almyghty God.' The worthy old clothier was not\r\nunmindful of the worship and laud of Thomas Paycocke also, and over £500\r\nin modern money was expended upon his burial ceremonies, over and above\r\nthe cost of founding his new chantry. Well indeed it was that his eyes\r\nwere closed in death, ere the coming of the Reformation abolished all\r\nthe chantries of England, and with them the Paycocke chantry in St\r\nKatherine's aisle, which had provided alms for six poor men weekly.\r\nThomas Paycocke belonged to the good old days; in a quarter of a century\r\nafter his death Essex was already changing. The monks were scattered\r\nfrom the abbey, which stood roofless; the sonorous Latin tongue no\r\nlonger echoed in the church, nor priests prayed there for the souls of\r\nThomas and his wife and his parents and his father-in-law. Even the\r\ncloth industry was changing, and the county was growing more prosperous\r\nstill with the advent of finer kinds of cloth, brought over there by\r\nfeat-fingered aliens, the 'new drapery', known as 'Bays and Says'. For\r\nas the adage says:\r\n\r\n     Hops, reformation, bays and beer\r\n     Came into England all in a year,\r\n\r\nand Coggeshall was destined to become more famous still for a new sort\r\nof cloth called 'Coxall's Whites', which Thomas Paycocke's nephews made\r\nwhen he was in his grave.[16] One thing, however, did not change; for\r\nhis beautiful house still stood in West Street, opposite the vicarage,\r\nand was the delight of all who saw it. It stands there still, and\r\nlooking upon it today, and thinking of Thomas Paycocke who once dwelt in\r\nit, do there not come to mind the famous words of Ecclesiasticus?\r\n\r\n     Let us now praise famous men and our fathers that begat us.\r\n     The Lord hath wrought great glory by them through His great\r\n     power from the beginning...\r\n\r\n     Rich men furnished with ability, living peaceably in their\r\n     habitations:\r\n     All these were honoured in their generations and were the\r\n     glory of their times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes and Sources_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PEASANT BODO\r\n\r\n_A.

The poem occurs in a version of English origin, in which one of\r\nthe dancers, Thierry, is cured of a perpetual trembling in all his limbs\r\nby a miracle of St Edith at the nunnery of Wilton in 1065.

See the Monk of St Gall's account of the finery of the Frankish\r\nnobles: 'It was a holiday and they had just come from Pavia, whither the\r\nVenetians had carried all the wealth of the East from their territories\r\nbeyond the sea,--others, I say, strutted in robes made of pheasant-skins\r\nand silk; or of the necks, backs and tails of peacocks in their first\r\nplumage. Some were decorated with purple and lemon-coloured ribbons;\r\nsome were wrapped round with blankets and some in ermine robes.' Op.\r\ncit., p. 149. The translation is a little loose: the 'phoenix robes' of\r\nthe original were more probably made out of the plumage, not of the\r\npheasant but of the scarlet flamingo, as Hodgson thinks _(Early Hist. of\r\nVenice_, p. 155), or possibly silks woven or embroidered with figures of\r\nbirds, as Heyd thinks _(Hist. du Commerce du Levant_, I, p. 111).\r\n\r\n26. The Monk of St. Gall's _Life_ in op. cit., pp. 81-2.\r\n\r\n27. This little poem was scribbled by an Irish scribe in the margin of a\r\ncopy of Priscian in the monastery of St Gall, in Switzerland, the same\r\nfrom which Charlemagne's highly imaginative biographer came. The\r\noriginal will be found in Stokes and Strachan, _Thesaurus\r\nPalæohibernicus_ (1903) II, p. 290. It has often been translated and I\r\nquote the translation by Kuno Meyer, _Ancient Irish Poetry_ (2nd ed.,\r\n1913), p. 99. The quotation from the _Triads of Ireland_ at the head of\r\nthis chapter is taken from Kuno Meyer also, ibid. pp. 102-3.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMARCO POLO\r\n\r\n_A. Raw Material_\r\n\r\n1. _The Book of Ser Marco Polo the Venetian concerning the Kingdoms and\r\nMarvels of the East_, trans. and ed. with notes by Sir Henry Yule (3rd\r\nedit., revised by Henri Cordier, 2 vols., Hakluyt Soc., 1903). See also\r\nH. Cordier, _Ser Marco Polo: Notes and Addenda_ (1920). The best edition\r\nof the original French text is _Le Livre de Marco Polo_, ed. G. Pauthier\r\n(Paris, 1865), The most convenient and cheap edition of the book for\r\nEnglish readers is a reprint of Marsden's translation (of the Latin\r\ntext) and notes (first published, 1818), with an introduction by John\r\nMasefield, _The Travels of Marco Polo the Venetian_ (Everyman's Library,\r\n1908; reprinted, 1911); but some of the notes (identifying places, etc.)\r\nare now out of date, and the great edition by Yule and Cordier should be\r\nconsulted where exact and detailed information is required. It is a mine\r\nof information, geographical and historical, about the East. I quote\r\nfrom the Everyman Edition as Marco Polo, op. cit., and from the Yule\r\nedition as Yule, op. cit.\r\n\r\n2. _La Cronique des Veneciens de Maistre Martin da Canal_. In _Archivo\r\nStorico Italiano_, 1st ser., vol. VIII (Florence, 1845). Written in\r\nFrench and accompanied by a translation into modern Italian. One of the\r\nmost charming of medieval chronicles.\r\n\r\n_B. Modern Works_\r\n\r\n1. For medieval Venice see--\r\n     F.C. Hodgson: _The Early History of Venice from the Foundation\r\n       to the Conquest of Constantinople_ (1901); and _Venice in the\r\n       Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries, A Sketch of Venetian History,\r\n       1204-1400_ (1910).\r\n     P.G. Molmenti: _Venice, its Growth to the Fall of the Republic_, vols.\r\n       I and II (_The Middle Ages_), trans. H.F. Brown (1906); and _La\r\n       Vie Privée à Venise_, vol. I (1895).\r\n     H.F. Brown: _Studies in the History of Venice_, vol. I (1907).\r\n     Mrs Oliphant: _The Makers of Venice_ (1905) is pleasant reading and\r\n       contains a chapter on Marco Polo.\r\n\r\n2. For medieval China, the Tartars, and European intercourse with the\r\nfar East see--\r\n     Sir Henry Yule's introduction to his great edition of Marco Polo (above).\r\n     _Cathay and the Way Thither: Medieval Notices of China_, trans. and\r\n       ed. by Sir Henry Yule, 4 vols. (Hakluyt Soc., 1915-16). Contains\r\n       an invaluable introduction and all the best accounts of China left\r\n       by medieval European travellers. Above all, Oderic of Pordenone\r\n       (d. 1331) should be read as a pendant to Marco Polo.\r\n     R. Beazley: _The Dawn of Modern Geography_, vols. II and III\r\n       (1897-1906).\r\n     R. Grousset: _Histoire de l'Asie_, t. III (3rd edit., 1922), Chap. I.\r\n       A short and charmingly written account of the Mongol Empires\r\n       from Genghis Khan to Timour.\r\n     H. Howarth: _History of the Mongols_ (1876).\r\n\r\n3. For medieval trade with the East the best book is--\r\n     W. Heyd: _Histoire du Commerce du Levant au Moyen-Âge_, trans.,\r\n       F. Raynaud; 2 vols. (Leipzig and Paris, 1885-6, reprinted 1923).\r\n\r\n_C. Notes to the Text_\r\n\r\n1. To be exact, the Flanders galleys which sailed via Gibraltar to\r\nSouthampton and Bruges were first sent out forty years after 1268--in\r\n1308. Throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries they sailed\r\nevery year, and Southampton owes its rise to prosperity to the fact that\r\nit was their port of call.\r\n\r\n2. The occasion of the speech quoted was when the imperial\r\nrepresentative Longinus was trying to get the help of the Venetians\r\nagainst the Lombards in 568 and invited them to acknowledge themselves\r\nsubjects of the Emperor. The speech is quoted in _Encyclop. Brit._, Art.\r\n_Venice_ (by H.F. Brown), p. 1002. The episode of the loaves of bread\r\nbelongs to the attempt of Pipin, son of Charlemagne, to starve out the\r\nRialto in the winter of 809-10. Compare the tale of Charlemagne casting\r\nhis sword into the sea, with the words, 'Truly, even as this brand which\r\nI have cast into the sea shall belong neither to me nor to you nor to\r\nany other man in all the world, even so shall no man in the world have\r\npower to hurt the realm of Venice; and he who would harm it shall feel\r\nthe wrath and displeasure of God, even as it has fallen upon me and my\r\npeople.'--See Canale, _Cron._, c. VIII. These are, of course,\r\nall legends.\r\n\r\n3. 'Voirs est que la mer Arians est de le ducat de Venise.'--Canale, op.\r\ncit., p. 600. Albertino Mussato calls Venice 'dominatrix Adriaci\r\nmaris.'--Molmenti, _Venice_, I, p. 120.\r\n\r\n4. See some good contemporary accounts of the ceremony quoted in\r\nMolmenti, _Venice_, I, pp. 212-15.\r\n\r\n5. During the fatal war of Chioggia between the two republics of Venice\r\nand Genoa, which ended in 1381, it was said that the Genoese admiral (or\r\nsome say Francesco Carrara), when asked by the Doge to receive peace\r\nambassadors, replied, 'Not before I have bitted the horses on St\r\nMark's.'--H.F. Brown, _Studies in the Hist. of Venice_, I, p. 130.\r\n\r\n6. Canale, op. cit., p. 270.\r\n\r\n7. 'The weather was clear and fine ... and when they were at sea, the\r\nmariners let out the sails to the wind, and let the ships run with\r\nspread sails before the wind over the sea'--See, for instance, Canale,\r\nop. cit., pp. 320, 326, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n8. Canale, op. cit., cc. I and II, pp. 268-72. Venice is particularly\r\nfortunate in the descriptions which contemporaries have left of her--not\r\nonly her own citizens (such as Canale, Sanudo and the Doge Mocenigo) but\r\nalso strangers. Petrarch's famous description of Venetian commerce, as\r\noccasioned by the view which he saw from his window in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, has often been quoted: 'See the innumerable vessels which set\r\nforth from the Italian shore in the desolate winter, in the most\r\nvariable and stormy spring, one turning its prow to the east, the other\r\nto the west; some carrying our wine to foam in British cups, our fruits\r\nto flatter the palates of the Scythians and, still more hard of\r\ncredence, the wood of our forests to the Egean and the Achaian isles;\r\nsome to Syria, to Armenia, to the Arabs and Persians, carrying oil and\r\nlinen and saffron, and bringing back all their diverse goods to us....\r\nLet me persuade you to pass another hour in my company. It was the depth\r\nof night and the heavens were full of storm, and I, already weary and\r\nhalf asleep, had come to an end of my writing, when suddenly a burst of\r\nshouts from the sailors penetrated my ear. Aware of what these shouts\r\nshould mean from former experience, I rose hastily and went up to the\r\nhigher windows of this house, which look out upon the port. Oh, what a\r\nspectacle, mingled with feelings of pity, of wonder, of fear and of\r\ndelight! Resting on their anchors close to the marble banks which serve\r\nas a mole to the vast palace which this free and liberal city has\r\nconceded to me for my dwelling, several vessels have passed the winter,\r\nexceeding with the height of their masts and spars the two towers which\r\nflank my house. The larger of the two was at this moment--though the\r\nstars were all hidden by the clouds, the winds shaking the walls, and\r\nthe roar of the sea filling the air--leaving the quay and setting out\r\nupon its voyage. Jason and Hercules would have been stupefied with\r\nwonder, and Tiphys, seated at the helm, would have been ashamed of the\r\nnothing which won him so much fame. If you had seen it, you would have\r\nsaid it was no ship but a mountain, swimming upon the sea, although\r\nunder the weight of its immense wings a great part of it was hidden in\r\nthe waves. The end of the voyage was to be the Don, beyond which nothing\r\ncan navigate from our seas; but many of those who were on board, when\r\nthey had reached that point, meant to prosecute their journey, never\r\npausing till they had reached the Ganges or the Caucasus, India and the\r\nEastern Ocean. So far does love of gain stimulate the human\r\nmind.'--Quoted from Petrarch's _Lettere Senili_ in Oliphant, _Makers of\r\nVenice_ (1905), p. 349; the whole of this charming chapter, 'The Guest\r\nof Venice', should be read. Another famous description of Venice occurs\r\nin a letter written by Pietro Aretino, a guest of Venice during the\r\nyears 1527 to 1533, to Titian, quoted in E. Hutton, _Pietro Aretino, the\r\nScourge of Princes_ (1922), pp. 136-7; compare also his description of\r\nthe view from his window on another occasion, quoted ibid., pp. 131-3.\r\nThe earliest of all is the famous letter written by Cassiodorus to the\r\nVenetians in the sixth century, which is partly translated in Molmenti,\r\nop. cit., I, pp. 14-15.\r\n\r\n9. The account of the march of the gilds occupies cc. CCLXIII-CCLXXXIII\r\nof Canale's Chronicle, op. cit., pp. 602-26. It has often been quoted.\r\n\r\n10. Canale, op. cit., c. CCLXI, p. 600.\r\n\r\n11. This account of Hangchow is taken partly from Marco Polo, op. cit.,\r\nbk. II, c. LXVIII: 'Of the noble and magnificent city of Kinsai'; and\r\npartly from Odoric of Pordenone, _Cathay and the Way Thither_, ed. Yule,\r\npp. 113-20.\r\n\r\n12. Oderic of Pordenone, who was a man before he was a friar, remarks:\r\n'The Chinese are comely enough, but colourless, having beards of long\r\nstraggling hair like mousers, cats I mean. And as for the women, they\r\nare the most beautiful in the world.' Marco Polo likewise never fails to\r\nnote when the women of a district are specially lovely, in the same way\r\nthat that other traveller Arthur Young always notes the looks of the\r\nchambermaids at the French inns among the other details of the\r\ncountryside, and is so much affronted if waited on by a plain girl.\r\nMarco Polo gives the palm for beauty to the women of the Province of\r\nTimochain (or Damaghan) on the north-east border of Persia, of which, he\r\nsays, 'The people are in general a handsome race, especially the women,\r\nwho, in my opinion, are the most beautiful in the world.'--Marco Polo,\r\nop. cit., p. 73. Of the women of Kinsai he reports thus: 'The courtesans\r\nare accomplished and are perfect in the arts of blandishment and\r\ndalliance, which they accompany with expressions adapted to every\r\ndescription of person, insomuch that strangers who have once tasted of\r\ntheir charms, remain in a state of fascination, and become so enchanted\r\nby their meretricious arts, that they can never divest themselves of the\r\nimpression. Thus intoxicated with sensual pleasures, when they return to\r\ntheir homes they report that they have been in Kinsai, or the celestial\r\ncity, and pant for the time when they may be enabled to revisit\r\nparadise.' Of the respectable ladies, wives of the master craftsmen he\r\nlikewise says: 'They have much beauty and are brought up with languid\r\nand delicate habits. The costliness of their dresses, in silks and\r\njewellery, can scarcely be imagined.'--op. cit., pp. 296, 297-8.\r\n\r\n13. Yule, op. cit., II, p. 184.\r\n\r\n14. For Prester John see Sir Henry Yule's article 'Prester John' in the\r\n_Encyclopædia Britannica_, and Lynn Thorndike, _A History of Magic and\r\nExperimental Science_ (1923), II, pp. 236-45. There is a pleasant\r\npopular account in S. Baring Gould, _Popular Myths of the Middle\r\nAges_ (1866-8).\r\n\r\n15. For their accounts see _The Journal of William of Rubruck to the\r\nEastern Parts, 1253-5, by himself, with two accounts of the Earlier\r\nJourney of John of Pian da Carpine_, trans. and ed. with notes by W.W.\r\nRockhill (Hakluyt Soc., 1900). Rubruck especially is a most\r\ndelightful person.\r\n\r\n16. This, together with the whole account of the first journey of the\r\nelder Polos, the circumstances of the second journey, and of their\r\nsubsequent return occurs in the first chapter of Marco Polo's book,\r\nwhich is a general introduction, after which he proceeds to describe in\r\norder the lands through which he passed. This autobiographical section\r\nis unfortunately all too short.\r\n\r\n17. As a matter of fact, William of Rubruck had seen and described it\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n18. For Marco Polo's account of this custom in the province which he\r\ncalls 'Kardandan', see op. cit., p. 250. An illustration of it from an\r\nalbum belonging to the close of the Ming dynasty is reproduced in S.W.\r\nBushell, _Chinese Art_ (1910), fig. 134.\r\n\r\n19. Marco Polo, _op. cit_., pp. 21-2.\r\n\r\n20. A certain _Poh-lo_ was, according to the Chinese annals of the\r\nMongol dynasty, appointed superintendent of salt mines at Yangchow\r\nshortly after 1282. Professor Parker thinks that he may be identified\r\nwith our Polo, but M. Cordier disagrees. See E.H. Parker _Some New Facts\r\nabout Marco Polos Book_ in _Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review_\r\n(1904), p. 128; and H. Cordier, _Ser Marco Polo_, p. 8.

Concerning the marginal notes by Columbus see Yule, _op. cit_., II,\r\nApp. H, p. 558. The book is preserved in the Colombina at Seville. I\r\nmust, however, frankly admit that modern research, iconoclastic as ever,\r\nnot content with white-washing Lucrezia Borgia and Catherine de Medicis,\r\nand with reducing Catherine of Siena to something near insignificance,\r\nis also making it appear more and more probable that Columbus originally\r\nset sail in 1492 to look for the islands of the Antilles, and that,\r\nalthough on his return after his great discovery in 1493 he maintained\r\nthat his design had always been to reach Cipangu, this was a _post hoc_\r\nstory, the idea of searching for Cipangu having probably come from his\r\npartner, Martin Pinzon. It is a pity that we do not know _when_ he made\r\nhis notes in the edition (the probable date of publication of which was\r\n1485) of Marco Polo's book, which might settle the matter. On the whole\r\nquestion see Henry Vignaud, _Études critiques sur la vie de Colomb avant\r\nses découvertes_ (Paris, 1905) and _Histoire de la Grande Enterprise de\r\n1492_, 2 vols. (Paris, 1910), and the summary and discussion of his\r\nconclusions by Professor A.P. Newton in _History_, VII (1922), pp. 38-42\r\n(_Historical Revisions_ XX.--'Christopher Columbus and his Great\r\nEnterprise.') The idea that a new road to the East was being sought at\r\nthis time, primarily because the Turks were blocking the old trade\r\nroutes, has also been exploded. See A.H. Lybyer, _The Ottoman Turks and\r\nthe Routes of Oriental Trade_ in _Eng. Hist. Review_, XXX (1915),\r\npp.577-88.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMADAME EGLENTYNE\r\n\r\n_A. Raw Material_\r\n\r\n1. Chaucer's description of the Prioress in the Prologue to the\r\n_Canterbury Tales_.\r\n\r\n2. Miscellaneous visitation reports in episcopal registers. On these\r\nregisters, and in particular the visitation documents therein, see R.C.\r\nFowler, _Episcopal Registers of England and Wales_ (S.P.C.K. Helps for\r\nStudents of History, No. 1), G.G. Coulton, _The Interpretation of\r\nVisitation Documents_ (Eng. Hist. Review, 1914), and c. XII of my book,\r\ncited below. A great many registers have been, or are being, published\r\nby learned societies, notably by the Canterbury and York Society, which\r\nexists for this purpose. The most important are the Lincoln visitations,\r\nnow in the course of publication, by Dr A. Hamilton Thompson,\r\n_Visitations of Religious Houses in the Diocese of Lincoln_, ed. A.\r\nHamilton Thompson (Lincoln Rec. Soc. and Canterbury and York Soc., 1915\r\nff.); two volumes have appeared so far, of which see especially vol. II,\r\nwhich contains part of Bishop Alnwick's visitations (1436-49); each\r\nvolume contains text, translation, and an admirable introduction. See\r\nalso the extracts from Winchester visitations trans. in H.G.D. Liveing,\r\n_Records of Romsey Abbey_ (1912). Full extracts from visitation reports\r\nand injunctions are given under the accounts of religious houses in the\r\ndifferent volumes of the Victoria County Histories (cited as V.C.H.).\r\n\r\n3.

Raw Material_\r\n\r\nI. _Le Ménagier de Paris, Traité de Morale et d'Economie Domestique,\r\ncompose vers_ 1393 _par un Bourgeois Parisien ... publié pour la\r\npremière fois par la Société des Bibliophiles Francois_. (Paris, 1846).\r\n2 vols., edited with an introduction by Jérôme Pichon. There is a notice\r\nof it by Dr F.J. Furnivall, at the end of his edition of _A Booke of\r\nPrecedence_ (Early English Text Soc., 1869 and 1898), pp. 149-54. It was\r\na book after his own heart, and he observes that it well deserves\r\ntranslation into English.\r\n\r\n2. On the subject of medieval books of deportment for women see A.A.\r\nHentsch, _De la littérature didactique du moyen âge s'addressant\r\nspécialement aux femmes_ (Cahors, 1903), an admirably complete\r\ncollection of analyses of all the chief works of this sort produced in\r\nwestern Europe from the time of St Jerome to the eve of the\r\nRenaissance. It is full of plums for adventurous Jack Horners.\r\n\r\n3. With the Ménagier's cookery book there may profitably be compared\r\n_Two Fifteenth Century Cookery Books_, ed. by Thomas Austin\r\n(E.E.T.S., 1888).\r\n\r\n_B. Notes to the Text_\r\n\r\n1. Pp. 1-2.\r\n\r\n2. These long moral treatises on the seven deadly sins and the even\r\ndeadlier virtues were very popular in the Middle Ages. The best known to\r\nEnglish readers occurs in the _Parson's Tale_ in Chaucer's _Canterbury\r\nTales,_ and is taken from the _Somme de Vices et de Vertus_ of Frère\r\nLorens, a thirteenth-century author. The sections on the deadly sins are\r\nusually, however, well worth reading, because of the vivid illustrative\r\ndetails which they often give about daily life. The Ménagier's sections\r\nare full of vigour and colour, as one would expect. Here, for instance,\r\nis his description of the female glutton: 'God commands fasting and the\r\nglutton says: \"I will eat\". God commands us to get up early and go to\r\nchurch and the glutton says: \"I must sleep. I was drunk yesterday. The\r\nchurch is not a hare; it will wait for me.\" When she has with some\r\ndifficulty risen, do you know what her hours are? Her matins are: \"Ha!\r\nwhat shall we have to drink? is there nothing left over from last\r\nnight?\" Afterwards she says her lauds thus: \"Ha! we drank good wine\r\nyesterday.\" Afterwards she says thus her orisons: \"My head aches, I\r\nshan't be comfortable until I have had a drink.\" Certes, such gluttony\r\nputteth a woman to shame, for from it she becomes a ribald, a\r\ndisreputable person and a thief. The tavern is the Devil's church, where\r\nhis disciples go to do him service and where he works his miracles. For\r\nwhen folk go there they go upright and well spoken, wise and sensible\r\nand well advised, and when they return they cannot hold themselves\r\nupright nor speak; they are all foolish and all mad, and they return\r\nswearing, beating and giving the lie to each other.'--_Op. cit_., I, pp.\r\n47-8. The section on Avarice is particularly valuable for its picture of\r\nthe sins of executors of wills, rack-renting lords, extortionate\r\nshopkeepers, false lawyers, usurers, and gamblers.--See _ibid_., I,\r\npp. 44-5.\r\n\r\n3. _Prudence and Melibeus_ is worth reading once, either in Chaucer's or\r\nin Renault de Louens' version, because of its great popularity in the\r\nMiddle Ages, and because of occasional vivid passages. Here, for\r\ninstance, is the episode in Chaucer's version, in which Melibeus, the\r\nsages, and the young men discuss going to war, and the sages advise\r\nagainst it: 'Up stirten thanne the yonge folk at ones, and the mooste\r\npartie of that compaignye scorned the wise olde men, and bigonnen to\r\nmake noyse, and seyden that \"Right so as, whil that iren is hoot, men\r\nsholden smyte, right so men sholde wreken hir wronges while that they\r\nbeen fresshe and newe\"; and with loud voys they criden, \"Werre! werre!\"\r\nUp roos tho oon of thise olde wise, and with his hand made contenaunce\r\nthat men sholde holden hem stille, and yeven hym audience. \"Lordynges,\"\r\nquod he, \"ther is ful many a man that crieth 'Werre! werre!' that woot\r\nful litel what werre amounteth. Werre at his bigynnyng hath so greet an\r\nentryng and so large, that every wight may entre whan hym liketh and\r\nlightly fynde werre; but certes, what ende that shal ther-of bifalle it\r\nis nat light to knowe; for soothly, whan that werre is ones bigonne ther\r\nis ful many a child unborn of his mooder that shal sterve yong by cause\r\nof that ilke werre, or elles lyve in sarwe, and dye in wrecchednesse;\r\nand therefore, er that any werre bigynne, men moste have greet conseil\r\nand greet deliberacioun.\"--Chaucer, _Tale of Melibeus_,§ 12; and see the\r\nFrench version, _op. cit_., I, p. 191.\r\n\r\n4. II, p. 72-9.\r\n\r\n5. I, pp. 71-2. These medieval games are very difficult to identify. The\r\nlearned editor remarks that _bric_, which is mentioned in the thirteenth\r\ncentury by Rutebeuf was played, seated, with a little stick; _qui féry_\r\nis probably the modern game called by the French _main chaude; pince\r\nmerille,_ which is mentioned among the games of Gargantua, was a game in\r\nwhich you pinched one of the players' arms, crying 'Mérille' or\r\n'Morille'. Though the details of these games are vague, there are many\r\nanalagous games played by children today, and it is easy to guess the\r\nkind of thing which is meant.\r\n\r\n6. I, pp. 13-15.\r\n\r\n7. I, 92, 96.\r\n\r\n8. The story of Jeanne la Quentine is reproduced in the _Heptameron_ of\r\nMargaret of Navarre (the 38th tale, or the 8th of the 4th day), where it\r\nis attributed to a _bourgeoise_ of Tours, but it is probable that the\r\nMénagier's is the original version, since he says that he had it from\r\nhis father; although, knowing the ways of the professional raconteur, I\r\nshould be the first to admit that this is not proof positive.\r\n\r\n9. I, pp. 125-6.\r\n\r\n10. I, p. 139.\r\n\r\n11. This was a favourite saying. It occurs in the story of Melibeus,\r\n'Trois choses sont qui gettent homme hors de sa maison, c'est assavoir\r\nla fumée, la goutière et la femme mauvaise.'--_Ibid_., I, p. 195.\r\nCompare Chaucer's use of it: 'Men seyn that thre thynges dryven a man\r\nout of his hous,--that is to seyn, smoke, droppyng of reyn and wikked\r\nwyves.'--_Tale of Melibeus_, §15; and\r\n\r\n'Thou seyst that droppying houses, and eek smoke,\r\nAnd chidyng wyves, maken men to flee\r\nOut of hir owene hous.'\r\n\r\n--_Wife of Bath's Prologue_, LL, 278-80.\r\n\r\n12. I, pp. 168-71, 174-6.\r\n\r\n13. II, p. 54. The Ménagier also warns against running up long bills on\r\ncredit. 'Tell your folk to deal with peaceable people and to bargain\r\nalways beforehand and to account and pay often, without running up long\r\nbills on credit by tally or on paper, although tally or paper are better\r\nthan doing everything by memory, for the creditors always think it more\r\nand the debtors less, and thus are born arguments, hatreds, and\r\nreproaches; and cause your good creditors to be paid willingly and\r\nfrequently what is owed to them, and keep them in friendship so that\r\nthey depart not from you, for one cannot always get peaceable\r\nfolk again.'\r\n\r\n14. II, pp. 56-9.\r\n\r\n15. It is curious here to note the antiquity of the term 'bloody' as an\r\nexpletive. The Ménagier says: 'Forbid them ... to use ugly oaths, or\r\nwords which are bad or indecent, as do certain evil or ill bred persons\r\nwho swear at bad bloody fevers, the bad bloody week, the bad bloody day\r\n('de males sanglantes fièvres,' 'de male sanglante sepmaine,' 'de male\r\nsanglante journée'), and they know not, nor should they know, what a\r\nbloody thing is, for honest women know it not, since it is abominable to\r\nthem to see the blood but of a lamb or a pigeon, when it is killed\r\nbefore them.'--_Ibid._, II, p. 59.\r\n\r\n16. The section on household management described above occupies sec.\r\nII, art. 2, of the Ménagier's book (II, pp. 53-72).\r\n\r\n17. I, pp. 171-2.\r\n\r\n18. I, pp. 172-3.\r\n\r\n19. The cookery book occupies sec. II, arts. 4 and 5 (II, pp. 80-272).\r\n\r\n20. II, pp. 222-3. Translated by Dr Furnivall in _A Booke of Precedence_\r\n(E.E.T.S.), pp. 152-3.\r\n\r\n21. II, pp. 108-18, 123. The feast was still a thing of the future when\r\nthe Ménagier thus gathered all the details. He calls it 'L'ordenance de\r\nnopces que fera maistre Helye en May, à un mardy ... l'ordonnance du\r\nsouper que fera ce jour.'\r\n\r\n22. 'The office of the woman is to make provision of tapestries, to\r\norder and spread them, and in especial to dight the room and the bed\r\nwhich shall be blessed.... And note that if the bed be covered with\r\ncloth, there is needed a fur coverlet of small vair, but if it be\r\ncovered with serge, or broidery, or pinwork of cendal, not.'--II, p.\r\n118. The editor quotes the following ceremony for blessing the wedding\r\nbed: '_Benedictio thalami ad nuptias et als_, Beredic, Domine, thalamum\r\nhunc et omnes habitantes in eo, ut in tua voluntate permaneant,\r\nrequiescant et multiplicentur in longitudinem dierum. Per Christum, etc.\r\n_Tunc thurificet thalamum in matrimonio, postea sponsum et sponsam\r\nsedentes vel jacentes in lecto suo. Benedicentur dicendo_: Benedic,\r\nDomine, adolescentulos istos; sicut benedixisti Thobiam et Sarram filiam\r\nRaguelis, ita benedicere eos digneris, Domine, ut in nomine tuo vivant\r\net senescant, et multiplicentur in longitudinem dierum. Per Christum,\r\netc. Benedictio Dei omnipotentis, Patris et Filii et Spiritus sancti\r\ndescendat super vos et maneat super vobiscum. In nomine Patris,\r\netc.'--_Ibid._, I, _Introd._, p. lxxxvi.\r\n\r\n23. Chaucer, _Tale of Melibeus_, § 15.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BETSON\r\n\r\n_A. Raw Material_\r\n\r\n1. _The Stonor Letters and Papers_, 1290-1483, ed. C.L. Kingsford (Royal\r\nHist. Soc., Camden, 3rd Series), 2 vols., 1919. The Betson\r\ncorrespondence is in vol. II.\r\n\r\n2. _The Cely Papers, selected from the Correspondence and Memoranda of\r\nthe Cely Family, Merchants of the Staple_, 1475-88, ed. H.E. Malden\r\n(Royal Hist. Soc., Camden 3rd series), 1900.\r\n\r\nI am much beholden to the excellent introductions to these two books,\r\nwhich are models of what editorial introductions should be.\r\n\r\n3. The best introduction to the history of the Company of the Staple is\r\nto be found in Mr Malden's aforesaid introduction to _The Cely Papers_,\r\nwhich also contains a masterly account of the political relations of\r\nEngland, France and Burgundy during the period. I have constantly relied\r\nupon Mr Malden's account of the working of the Staple system. Other\r\nuseful short accounts of the wool trade and the Stapler's Company may be\r\nfound in the following works: Sir C.P. Lucas, _The Beginnings of English\r\nOverseas Enterprise_ (1917), c. II; and A.L. Jenckes, _The Staple of\r\nEngland_ (1908).\r\n\r\n_B. Notes to the Text_\r\n\r\n1. Four interesting contemporary illustrations of Parliament in 1523,\r\n1585, some date during the seventeenth century, and 1742 respectively,\r\nare reproduced in Professor A.F. Pollard's stimulating study of _The\r\nEvolution of Parliament_ (1920).\r\n\r\n2. _The Lybelle of Englyshe Polycye_, in _Political Poems and Songs_,\r\ned. Thos. Wright (Rolls Ser., 1861), II, p. 162. This remarkable poem\r\nwas written in 1436 or 1437, in order to exhort the English 'to kepe the\r\nsee enviroun and namelye the narowe see' between Dover and Calais, since\r\nin the author's opinion the basis of England's greatness lay in her\r\ntrade, for the preservation of which she needed the dominion of the\r\nseas. Its chief value lies in the very complete picture which it gives\r\nof English import and export trade with the various European countries.\r\nThere is a convenient edition of it in _The Principal Navigations\r\nVoyages Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation by Richard\r\nHakluyt_ (Everyman's Lib. Edition, 1907), I, pp. 174-202.\r\n\r\n3. G.W. Morris and L.S. Wood, _The Golden Fleece_ (1922), p. 17.\r\n\r\n4. For accounts of these brasses see H.

With deference, I think that Mr Malden in his introduction to the\r\n_Cely Papers_, App. II, pp. lii-iii, is mistaken in seeking to identify\r\nSynchon Mart with a particular fair at Antwerp on St John's Day, Bammes\r\nmart with the fair at St Rémy (a Flemish name for whom is Bamis) on\r\nAugust 8, and Cold Mart with Cortemarck near Thourout. The names simply\r\nrefer to the seasons in which there were fairs in most of the important\r\ncentres, though doubtless in one place the winter and in another the\r\nspring, summer, or autumn fair was the more important. That the names\r\nrefer to seasons and not to places appears quite clearly in various\r\nletters and regulations relating to the Merchant Adventurers of York.\r\nSee _The York Mercers and Merchant Adventurers_, 1356-1917, ed. M.\r\nSellers (Surtees Soc., 1918), pp. 117, 121-5, 160, 170-1; see Miss\r\nSellers' note, _ibid_., p. 122, quoting W. Cunningham: 'The ancient\r\nCeltic fairs ... were a widespread primitive institution and appear to\r\nhave been fixed for dates marked by the change of seasons.'--_Scottish\r\nHist. Review_, xiii, p. 168. For instance, a document of 1509 ('For now\r\natt this cold marte last past, holdyn at Barow in Brabond,' _loc. cit_.\r\np. 121) disposes of the idea that the Cold mart was the mart at\r\nCortemarck, while another document refers to merchants intending to ship\r\n'to the cold martes' and 'to the synxon martes' in the plural. _Ibid_.,\r\np. 123. The identification of Balms mart with the fair at St Rémy on\r\nAugust 8 is, moreover, belied by the same document (1510-11), which\r\nruns, 'Whereas this present marte ... we have lycensed and set you at\r\nlibertie to shipp your commodities to the balmes marte next coming.\r\nNevertheless ... we thinke it good ... that upon the recepte of these\r\nour letters ye ... assemble and consult together, and if ye shall thinke\r\ngood amongest yourselffs ... discretly to withdraw and with holde your\r\nhands from shippyng to the said balmes marte.... Wryten at Andwarp the\r\nxvij day of August.' _Ibid_., p. 124. The Balms mart was obviously the\r\nautumn fairtide, and Mr Malden is no doubt right in identifying Balms\r\n(Bammys, Bammes) with Bamis, the local Flemish name of St Rémy; St\r\nRémy's Day was October 28, and the Balms mart was not the mart held on\r\nAugust 8 at St Rémy, but the mart held on and round about St Rémy's\r\nDay. Another document of 1552 gives interesting information about the\r\nshippings for three of the marts: 'The last daye of shippinge unto the\r\nfyrst shippinge beinge for the pasche marte is ordeyned to be the laste\r\nof Marche nexte ensuyinge; and the seconde shippinge which is appointed\r\nfor the sinxon marte the laste day to the same, is appoynted the laste\r\nof June then nexte followinge; and unto the colde marte the laste day of\r\nshippinge is appoynted to be the laste of November then nexte\r\ninsuyinge.'--_Ibid_., p. 147. The Merchant Adventurers tried sometimes\r\nto restrict merchants to the Cold and the Synxon marts, which were the\r\nmost important.\r\n\r\n65. _Cely Papers_, p. xl, and _passim_.\r\n\r\n66. _Ibid_., p. 74.

Thomas Betson was doubtless acquainted with\r\nGilbert and Rawson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PAYCOCKE OF COGGESHALL\r\n\r\n_A. Raw Material_\r\n\r\n1. The raw material for this chapter consists of Paycocke's House,\r\npresented to the Nation in 1924 by the Right Hon. Noel Buxton, M.P.,\r\nwhich stands in West Street, Coggeshall, Essex (station, Kelvedon); the\r\nPaycocke brasses, which lie in the North aisle of the parish church of\r\nSt Peter ad Vincula at Coggeshall; and the wills of John Paycocke (_d_.\r\n1505), Thomas Paycocke (_d_. 1518), and Thomas Paycocke (_d_. 1580),\r\nwhich are now preserved at Somerset House (P.C.C. Adeane 5, Ayloffe 14,\r\nand Arundell 50, respectively), and of which that of the first Thomas\r\nhas been printed in Mr Beaumont's paper, cited below, while I have\r\nanalysed fully the other two in my book, _The Paycockes of Coggeshall_\r\n(1920), which deals at length with the history of the Paycockes and\r\ntheir house. See also G.F. Beaumont, _Paycocke's House, Coggeshall, with\r\nsome Notes on the Families of Paycocke and Buxton_ (reprinted from\r\nTrans. Essex Archæol. Soc., IX, pt. V) and the same author's _History of\r\nCoggeshall_ (1890). There is a beautifully illustrated article on the\r\nhouse in _Country Life_ (June 30, 1923), vol. LIII, pp. 920-6.\r\n\r\n2. For an apotheosis of the clothiers, see _The Pleasant History of John\r\nWinchcomb, in his younger days called Jack of Newbery, the famous and\r\nworthy Clothier of England_ and _Thomas of Reading, or the Six Worthy\r\nYeomen of the West_, in _The Works of Thomas Deloney_, ed. F.O. Mann\r\n(1912), nos. II and V. The first of these was published in 1597 and the\r\nother soon afterwards and both went through several editions by 1600.\r\n\r\n3. On the cloth industry in general see G. Morris and L. Wood, _The\r\nGolden Fleece_ (1922); E. Lipson, _The Woollen Industry_ (1921); and\r\nW.J.

Dunkin.\r\n\r\n4. _Testamenta Eboracensia, a selection of wills from the Registry at\r\nYork_, ed. James Raine, 6 vols. (Surtees Soc., 1836-1902). The Surtees\r\nSociety has also published several other collections of wills from\r\nDurham and elsewhere, relating to the northern counties. A large number\r\nof wills have been printed or abstracted. See, for instance, _Wills and\r\nInventories from the Registers of Bury St Edmunds_, ed. S. Tymms (Camden\r\nSoc., 1850); _Calendar of Wills Proved and Enrolled in the Court of\r\nHastings_, _London_, ed. R.R. Sharpe, 2 vols.

Foster (Lincoln\r\nRecord Soc., 1914); and _Somerset Medieval Wills_, 1383-1558, ed. F.W.\r\nWeaver, 3 vols. (Somerset Record Soc., 1901-5).\r\n\r\n5. The will of the other Thomas Paycocke 'cloathemaker', who died in\r\n1580, also refers to the family business. He leaves twenty shillings 'to\r\nWilliam Gyon my weaver'; also 'Item, I doe give seaven poundes tenne\r\nshillinges of Lawful money of Englande to and amongest thirtie of the\r\npoorest Journeymen of the Fullers occupacion in Coggeshall aforesaide,\r\nthat is to every one of them fyve shillinges.' William Gyon or Guyon was\r\nrelated to a very rich clothier, Thomas Guyon, baptized in 1592 and\r\nburied in 1664, who is said to have amassed £100,000 by the trade.\r\nThomas Paycocke's son-in-law Thomas Tyll also came of a family of\r\nclothiers, for in a certificate under date 1577 of wool bought by\r\nclothiers of Coggeshall during the past year there occur the names of\r\nThomas Tyll, William Gyon, John Gooddaye (to whose family the first\r\nThomas Paycocke left legacies), Robert Lytherland (who receives a\r\nconsiderable legacy under the will of the second Thomas), and Robert\r\nJegon (who is mentioned incidentally in the will as having a house near\r\nthe church and was father of the Bishop of Norwich of that name). See\r\nPower, _The Paycockes of Coggeshall_, pp. 33-4.\r\n\r\n6. Quoted in Lipson, _Introd. to the Econ. Hist, of England_ (1905), I,\r\np. 421.\r\n\r\n7. Quoted _ibid_., p. 417.\r\n\r\n8.

The house subsequently passed, it is not quite clear at what date,\r\ninto the hands of another family of clothiers, the Buxtons, who had\r\nintermarried with the Paycockes some time before 1537. William Buxton\r\n(_d_. 1625) describes himself as 'clothyer of Coggeshall' and leaves\r\n'all my Baey Lombs [Looms]' to his son Thomas. Thomas was seventeen when\r\nhis father died and lived until 1647, also carrying on business as a\r\nclothier, and the house was certainly in his possession. He or his\r\nfather may have bought it from John Paycocke's executors. By him it was\r\nhanded down to his son Thomas, also a clothier (_d_. 1713), who passed\r\nit on to his son Isaac, clothier (_d_. 1732). Isaac's two eldest sons\r\nwere clothiers likewise, but soon after their father's death they\r\nretired from business. He apparently allowed his third son, John, to\r\noccupy the house as his tenant, and John was still living there in 1740.\r\nBut Isaac had left the house by will in 1732 to his youngest son,\r\nSamuel, and Samuel, dying in 1737, left it to his brother Charles, the\r\nfourth son of Isaac. Charles never lived in it, because he spent most of\r\nhis life in the pursuit of his business as an oil merchant in London,\r\nthough he is buried among his ancestors in Coggeshall Church. In 1746 he\r\nsold the house to Robert Ludgater and it passed completely out of the\r\nPaycocke-Buxton connexion, and in the course of time fell upon evil days\r\nand was turned into two cottages, the beautiful ceilings being plastered\r\nover. It was on the verge of being destroyed some years ago when it was\r\nbought and restored to its present fine condition by Mr Noel Buxton, a\r\ndirect lineal descendant of the Charles Buxton who sold it.

But this shire\r\nseemeth to me to deserve the title of the Englishe Goshen, the fattest\r\nof the lande, comparable to Palestina, that flowed with milk and\r\nhunnye.'--Norden, _Description of Essex_ (1594), (Camden Soc.), p. 7.\r\n\r\n16. According to Leake, writing about 1577, 'About 1528 began the first\r\nspinning on the distaffe and making of Coxall clothes.... These Coxall\r\nclothes weare first taught by one Bonvise, an Italian.'--Quoted _V.C.H.\r\nEssex_, II, p. 382.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notes on Illustrations_\r\n\r\nPLATE I. _Bodo at his work_\r\n\r\nFrom an eleventh-century Anglo-Saxon calendar in the British Museum (MS.\r\nTit., B.V., pt. I), showing the occupations of Bodo, or of his masters,\r\nfor each month of the year. The months illustrated are January\r\n(ploughing with oxen), March (breaking clods in a storm), August\r\n(reaping), and December (threshing and winnowing). The other pictures\r\nrepresent February (pruning), April (Bodo's masters feasting), May\r\n(keeping sheep), June (mowing), July (woodcutting), September (Bodo's\r\nmasters boar-hunting), October (Bodo's masters hawking), and November\r\n(making a bonfire).\r\n\r\nPLATE II. _Embarkation of the Polos at Venice_\r\n\r\nFrom the magnificent MS. of Marco Polo's book, written early in the\r\nfifteenth century and now preserved at the Bodleian Library, Oxford (MS.\r\nno. 264, f. 218). The artist gives an admirable view of medieval Venice,\r\nwith the Piazetta to the left, and the Polos embarking on a rowing boat\r\nto go on board their ship. In the foreground are depicted (after the\r\nmedieval fashion of showing several scenes of a story in the same\r\npicture) some of the strange lands through which they passed. Note the\r\nVenetian trading ships.\r\n\r\nPLATE III. _Part of a landscape roll by Chao Mêng-fu_\r\n\r\nThis very beautiful scene is taken from a roll painted by Chao Mêng-fu\r\nin 1309 in the style of Wang Wei, a poet and artist of the T'ang dynasty\r\n(A.D. 699-759). A fine description of it is given by Mr Laurence Binyon:\r\n'In the British Museum collection is a long roll, over seventeen feet\r\nlong, painted almost entirely in blues and greens on the usual warm\r\nbrown silk.... It is one continuous landscape, in which the scenes melt\r\ninto one another. Such rolls are not meant to be exhibited or looked at\r\nall at once, but enjoyed in small portions at a time, as the painting is\r\nslowly unrolled and the part already seen rolled up again. No small\r\nmastery is requisite, as may be imagined, to contrive that wherever the\r\nspectator pauses an harmonious composition is presented. One has the\r\nsensation, as the roll unfolds, of passing through a delectable country.\r\nIn the foreground water winds, narrowing and expanding, among verdant\r\nknolls and lawns, joined here and there by little wooden bridges; and\r\nthe water is fed by torrents that plunge down among pine-woods from\r\ncrags of fantastic form, glowing with hues of lapis-lazuli and jade;\r\nunder towering peaks are luxuriant valleys, groves with glimpses of\r\nscattered deer, walled parks, clumps of delicate bamboo, and the distant\r\nroofs of some nestling village. Here and there is a pavilion by the\r\nwater in which poet or sage sits contemplating the beauty round him.\r\nThese happy and romantic scenes yield at last to promontory and reed-bed\r\non the borders of a bay where a fisherman's boat is rocking on the\r\nswell. It is possible that a philosophic idea is intended to be\r\nsuggested--the passage of the soul through the pleasant delights of\r\nearth to the contemplation of the infinite.'--Laurence Binyon, _Painting\r\nin the Far East_ (1908), pp. 75-6. The section of the roll which has\r\nbeen chosen for reproduction here has already been reproduced in S.W.\r\nBushell, _Chinese Art_ (1910), II, Fig. 127, where it is thus described:\r\n'A lake with a terraced pavilion on an island towards which a visitor is\r\nbeing ferried in a boat, while fishermen are seen in another boat\r\npulling in their draw-net; the distant mountains, the pine-clad hills in\r\nthe foreground, the clump of willow opposite, and the line of reeds\r\nswaying in the wind along the bank of the water are delightfully\r\nrendered, and skilfully combined to make a characteristic\r\npicture.'--_Ibid_., II, p. 134. Other sections of the same roll are\r\nreproduced in H.A. Giles, _Introd. to the Hist, of Chinese Pictorial\r\nArt_ (2nd ed., 1918) facing p. 56; and in L. Binyon, _op. cit_., plate\r\nIII (facing p. 66). It is exceedingly interesting to compare this\r\nlandscape roll with the MS of Marco Polo, illuminated about a century\r\nlater, from which the scene of the embarkation at Venice has been taken;\r\nthe one is so obviously the work of a highly developed and the other of\r\nan almost naïve and childish civilization.\r\n\r\nPLATE IV. _Madame Eglentyne at home_\r\n\r\nThis is a page from a fine manuscript of _La Sainte Abbaye_, now in the\r\nBritish Museum (MS. Add. 39843, f. 6 vo). At the top of the picture a\r\npriest with two acolytes prepares the sacrament; behind them stands the\r\nabbess, holding her staff and a book, and accompanied by her chaplain\r\nand the sacristan, who rings the bell; behind them is a group of four\r\nnuns, including the cellaress with her keys, and nuns are seen at the\r\nwindows of the dorter above. At the bottom is a procession of priest,\r\nacolytes and nuns in the choir; notice the big candles carried by the\r\nyoung nuns (perhaps novices) in front, and the notation of the\r\nmusic books.\r\n\r\nPLATE V. _The Ménagier's wife has a garden party_\r\n\r\nThis beautiful scene is taken from a fifteenth-century manuscript of the\r\n_Roman de la Rose_ (Harl. MS. 4425), which is one of the greatest\r\ntreasures of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nPLATE VI. _The Ménagier's wife cooks his supper with the aid of his\r\nbook_\r\n\r\nFrom MS. Royal, 15 D. I, f. 18, in the British Museum which is part of a\r\n_petite bible historiale_, or biblical history, by Guyart des Moulins,\r\nexpanded by the addition of certain books of the Bible, in French. It\r\nwas made at Bruges by the order of Edward IV, King of England by one J.\r\ndu Ries and finished in 1470, so that it is about eighty years later\r\nthan the Ménagier's book. The illustration represents a scene from the\r\nstory of Tobias; Tobit, sick and blind, is lying in bed, and his wife\r\nAnna is cooking by the fire, with the help of a book and a serving maid.\r\nThe right-hand half of the picture, which is not reproduced here, shows\r\nthe outside of the house, with Tobias bringing in the angel Raphael. The\r\nilluminated border of the page from which this scene is taken contains\r\nthe arms of Edward IV, with the garter and crown.\r\n\r\nPLATE VII. _Calais about the time of Thomas Betson_\r\n\r\nThis plan of Calais in 1546 is reproduced from a 'Platt of the Lowe\r\nCountrye att Calleys, drawne in October, the 37th Hen. VIII, by Thomas\r\nPettyt,' now in the British Museum. (Cott. MS. Aug. I, vol.
