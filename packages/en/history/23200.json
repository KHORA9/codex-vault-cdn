V., NO. 1 JANUARY, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEGRO IN EDUCATION[1]\r\n\r\nIn the early history of America there were three types of\r\nsettlements--the French, Spanish, and English. In the French Provinces\r\nthe teachings of the \"Code Noir\" made it incumbent upon the masters to\r\nteach the slaves, at least to read, in order, of course, that they\r\nmight read the Bible; and in the Spanish districts the Latin custom of\r\nmiscegenation prevented the rise of objections to the teaching of\r\nslaves, in case there should be any who cared to instruct the Negroes.\r\nIn the English Provinces, on the other hand, since teaching the slaves\r\nwould probably result in their becoming Christians, the colonists\r\nnaturally were strenuous in their efforts to prevent any enlightenment\r\nof the blacks, due to the existence of an unwritten law to the effect\r\nthat no Christian might be held a slave. Many planters forbade the\r\nteaching of their slaves, until finally the Bishop of London settled\r\nthe difficulty by issuing a formal declaration in which he stated that\r\nconversion did not work manumission.[2]\r\n\r\nThe rudimentary education of Negroes was one of the first claims on\r\npioneer Christian teachers. Although the _Negro Year Book_ for 1914-15\r\nmakes note of a public school for Indians and Negroes established in\r\n1620, according to Brawley and Du Bois, the first schools to be\r\nestablished were private institutions.[3] In New York City in 1704 a\r\nschool was opened for Negroes and Indians by Elias Neau and in 1750\r\nAnthony Benezet established an evening school for the blacks in\r\nPhiladelphia. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel\r\nestablished in Charleston in 1744 a mission school, in which two\r\nNegroes were employed to instruct their fellowmen. The free Negroes in\r\nCharleston established a school in 1774 and those in Boston started a\r\nschool in 1798. In 1764 the editor of a paper in Williamsburg,\r\nVirginia, opened a school for Negroes and in 1800 a schoolhouse and\r\n350 acres of ground were left by the will of Robert Pleasants to be\r\nused for the benefit of Negro children.[4] About this same time in\r\nNewark, New Jersey, the Kosciusko School was established by means of a\r\nsum amounting to $13,000 left by Kosciusko for the education of the\r\nNegroes.[5] In the Middle West private schools had been organized by\r\nmanumitted Negroes.\r\n\r\nSt. Frances Academy, established in Baltimore in 1829, by The Colored\r\nWoman's Society, was the first school for colored girls. An institute\r\nfor Negro children was established in 1837 in Cheyney, Pennsylvania,\r\nwith the $10,000 left by Richard Humphries. By 1838 there were\r\nthirteen private schools in Philadelphia for the education of the\r\nNegro and in 1849 Avery College was established in Allegheny. Many of\r\nthe schools were organized by church societies. The African Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church purchased in 1844 120 acres of land in Ohio upon\r\nwhich was opened the Union Seminary in 1847. This church later in\r\nco-operation with the Methodist Episcopal Church, North, established\r\nWilberforce University in Ohio in 1856. Oberlin College in Ohio was\r\nopened in 1833 and Ashmun Institute, which later became Lincoln\r\nUniversity, was established in 1854 in Pennsylvania. Nevertheless,\r\nthere was in certain parts much opposition on the part of the\r\ncitizens, evidenced by the mobbing of a young Quaker woman, Prudence\r\nCrandall, in Canterbury, Connecticut, in 1832, for having opened a\r\nschool for Negro children; and in 1835 by the removal from the town of\r\nNoyes Academy in Canaan, New Hampshire, a school which had opened its\r\ndoors to Negroes.\r\n\r\nThe efforts toward education for the Negro were disconnected and\r\nunorganized, while the laws opposing such education were fast\r\nincreasing, so that the results seem very astonishing, despite the\r\nfact that so little was really accomplished. As early as 1740 South\r\nCarolina enacted a law forbidding the education of Negroes or the\r\nemployment of slaves as scribes. Ohio in 1848 forbade Negroes and\r\nmulatoes to attend schools. Indiana enacted no law against Negro\r\neducation but in 1850 omitted the Negroes from the school tax, which\r\nin turn resulted in their expulsion from education in that State. In\r\n1852 Delaware enacted a law declaring the schools free for all white\r\nchildren over five years of age. In spite of all the regulations and\r\nsevere laws opposing the education of the Negro many \"clandestine\r\nschools\" were held in Charleston, Savannah, and New Orleans before\r\n1860.[6] The private schools increased in number rapidly during the\r\nearly nineteenth century among the free Negroes in the District of\r\nColumbia and the border States. They were less numerous in the South\r\nexcept in certain particular districts. In Washington, D.C., and New\r\nOrleans it is reported that at the opening of the Civil War there were\r\nabout twenty schools for Negroes established.[7] It is also estimated\r\nthat in the slave States in 1860 there were 4,000 free Negro children\r\nin school.[8] These figures, however, are relatively small in\r\ncomparison with the numbers and economic standards of the free\r\nNegroes. In 1836 in New Orleans alone the freedmen numbered 855, owned\r\n620 slaves, and held property whose assessed value equaled\r\n$2,462,470.[9] By 1860 the total number of free Negroes was 487,970,\r\nor about one ninth of the entire black population;[10] but the\r\nmajority of these freedmen were in the rural districts, whereas the\r\neducational opportunities were in the cities, so that in 1863, with\r\nonly 5 per cent of the Negro population literate the problem was\r\nindeed difficult, as far as the education of the black race was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe next period in the education of the Negro was a decade of the\r\nestablishment of schools by the carpet-bag governments, mission\r\nsocieties, and the Freedmen's Bureau. Some of the schools established\r\nby the Negro carpet-baggers became very efficient. For example, in\r\nFlorida, Jonathan C. Gibbs, a Negro graduate of Dartmouth, succeeded\r\nin founding in that State a splendid system of schools, which remained\r\neven after the fall of the carpet-bag governments.[11] The American\r\nMissionary Association was the first benevolent organization to take\r\nup the work of education. The plan of this association was to\r\nestablish one school of higher learning in each of the larger States\r\nin the South; normal and graded schools in the principal cities; and\r\ncommon and parochial schools in the smaller country places. As a\r\nresult of this program, the principal institutions established were\r\nHampton Institute, Atlanta University, Fisk University, Straight\r\nUniversity, Talladega College, Tougaloo University, and Tillston\r\nCollege.[12] The American Baptist Home Mission Society started work in\r\n1862, which resulted in eight schools: Atlanta Baptist College and\r\nVirginia Union University for men; Spelman Seminary and Hartshorn\r\nMemorial College for women; and the coeducational institutions, Bishop\r\nCollege, Benedict College, Shaw University, and Jackson College.[13]\r\nIn 1866, just before the beginning of the work of the Freedmen's\r\nBureau in education, the schools so far established had in attendance\r\nnearly 100,000.[14] The Freedmen's Bureau had been established in 1865\r\nby an act of Congress and by 1867 it reported 1,056 Negro teachers and\r\nin 1870 the number was increased to 1,342. During the five years of\r\nits work, this bureau established 4,239 schools in the South, with a\r\ntotal number of teachers of 9,307 and of students, 247,333.[15]\r\nHoward University, established in 1867, was one of these institutions.\r\nThe Freedman's Aid Society was organized by the northern Methodists in\r\n1866 and to-day this society supports fifty institutions, ten of which\r\nare collegiate.[16]\r\n\r\nAt the end of this period many religious agencies were establishing\r\nschools. The Episcopalians established the St. Paul Normal and\r\nIndustrial School at Lawrence, Virginia, and St. Augustine's in\r\nRaleigh, North Carolina. The Roman Catholics opened St. Joseph's\r\nIndustrial School at Clayton, Delaware; St. Augustine's Academy and\r\nSt. Frances' Academy. Besides these they have in the United States 87\r\nschools for Negro children cared for by 24 sisterhoods.[17] The\r\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Zion Church has established twelve\r\ninstitutions, four colleges, one theological school, and seven\r\nsecondary schools.[18] The Presbyterian Board of Missions has\r\nestablished Biddle University in North Carolina, five seminaries for\r\ngirls, and 70 academies and parochial schools.[19] The work of this\r\nperiod was not only constructive as far as Negro education was\r\nconcerned, but it also affected the life of the white population as\r\nwell by instituting public school systems in \"regions where public\r\nschools had been unknown,\"[20] bringing about a new attitude in the\r\nSouth toward public schools in general, since the whites up to this\r\ntime had, in the words of Colonel Richard P. Hallowell, \"regarded the\r\npublic school system in the North with contempt.\"[20]\r\n\r\nToward the end of this period a new type of education was introduced\r\nby the founding of Hampton Institute in 1875. This marked the\r\nbeginning of the period of industrialism, the purpose of such\r\neducation being to give the Negro children \"combined mental, moral and\r\nindustrial training.\"[21] Following the founding of Hampton, Tuskegee\r\nInstitute was established; also being an industrial school. With\r\nthese two institutions as centers, the ideals of the industrial\r\npropagandist radiated in all directions, finally permeating the whole\r\neducational system, not only that of the Negro, but the educational\r\nsystem of the schools for white children as well.\r\n\r\nAlthough separation of the black and white children in the public\r\nschools is forbidden in fourteen of the States, the law requires the\r\nseparation of the children in the following States: Alabama, Arkansas,\r\nDelaware, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana,\r\nMaryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas,\r\nVirginia, and West Virginia. In Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, and Wyoming,\r\nthe boards of education are given the power to decide the question.\r\nEleven of the States of the Union make no provision in their laws one\r\nway or the other[22] Separation is demanded in the private schools in\r\nKentucky, Florida, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. The law in Kentucky was\r\ncreated at a time when it affected only one institution--that of Berea\r\nCollege, which was established in 1856 for the education of\r\nanti-slavery whites and was opened to Negro students after the Civil\r\nWar. In 1904, the date of the passage of the law, this college had 927\r\nstudents, 174 of whom were Negroes.[23] All of the Northern States\r\nhave compulsory education, but only two of the Southern States,\r\nKentucky and Missouri, have enacted such laws. This does not mean, of\r\ncourse, that these laws are enforced, nor is this a key to the amount\r\nof education obtained in proportion to the population, but it does\r\nindicate the difference in opportunities for education between the\r\nNorthern and Southern States.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the elementary education of the Negro children the whole\r\nsituation is rather discouraging, but great progress has been made and\r\none may hope for still greater progress in the future. The increase in\r\nfacilities for education between 1866 and 1870 was quite marked, with\r\na corresponding increase in the number of pupils, as shown by the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n      INCREASE IN EDUCATION FROM 1866 TO 1870[24]\r\n\r\n  +==========+===========+===============+==========+\r\n  |   Date   |  Schools  |No. Teachers   | Pupils   |\r\n  +----------+-----------+---------------+----------+\r\n  |   1866   |     975   |     1,405     |  90,778  |\r\n  |   1867   |   1,839   |     2,087     | 111,442  |\r\n  |   1868   |   1,831   |     2,295     | 104,327  |\r\n  |   1869   |   2,118   |     2,455     | 114,522  |\r\n  |   1870   |   2,677   |     3,300     | 149,581  |\r\n  +----------+-----------+---------------+----------+\r\n\r\nThe total expenditure for education during this period was $5,879,924.\r\nThere was in 1870, however, only about one tenth of the Negro children\r\nof school age in school. Later, from 1889 to 1909, the number of\r\nchildren enrolled greatly increased:\r\n\r\nPERCENTAGE OF PERSONS 5 TO 18 YEARS ENROLLED[25]\r\n\r\n    Date            White        Colored\r\n  1889-1890         66.28         51.65\r\n  1899-1900         72.32         57.67\r\n  1908-1909         74.76         58.34\r\n\r\nIn the first year more than half the children were in school, a decade\r\nlater the increase was practically the same in the case of the Negro\r\nchildren as it was in the case of the white children, but nine years\r\nlater the percentage had risen over 2 per cent in the case of the\r\nwhite children and had decreased in the case of the blacks. The census\r\nreport of 1910 shows the percentage of Negro children enrolled in\r\nschool to be but 47.3 per cent, a decrease of 9 per cent. The average\r\nattendance of the Negro children amounted to about one-third of the\r\nnumber enrolled.[26] For these children there were 28,000 teachers, or\r\nin other words, one teacher to every group of 57 children; whereas the\r\nteachers for the white children averaged one to 45. The report of the\r\nCommissioner of Education in 1909 gives a total number of school\r\nchildren in the slave States of 3,054,888, instructed by 9,000 school\r\nteachers--3,114 males and 5,886 female.[27] According to this report,\r\nthere would only be one teacher to every group of 184.35 children.\r\nThis seems an impossible number, so that one feels that surely\r\nsomething must be wrong with the report. The training of these school\r\nteachers is not of the highest, nor do they have a great deal of\r\ntraining. The State School Commissioner of Georgia gives the following\r\nreport of conditions there:[28]\r\n\r\n    326 teachers with normal certificates,\r\n    129 teachers with first grade certificates,\r\n    476 teachers with second grade certificates,\r\n  2,037 teachers held third grade certificates.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures for all the children equaled $46,000,000, but the\r\nNegro children who were one third of the total number received but one\r\nseventh of this sum. For 231,801 Negro children South Carolina spent\r\n$366,734.28, or $1.58 per capita, whereas Massachusetts spends $27 per\r\ncapita each year, and the District of Columbia spends $35.21. The\r\nSouth Carolina school tax is heavier than the tax in Massachusetts,\r\nbut this State spends only $3.82 per capita for white children.[29]\r\nLouisiana spends 93 per cent of the school funds for the white\r\nchildren, and 7 per cent for the colored, making a per capita\r\nexpenditure of $16.60 for the white children and for the Negro an\r\nexpenditure of $1.59. The District of Columbia spends more for the\r\ncolored children than for the white, per capita expenditure: white,\r\n$20.82; Negro, $21.87.[30]\r\n\r\nThe rural schools, as may be expected, are in a worse condition than\r\nthose of the city, in regard to equipment, teachers, and especially in\r\nsubject matter relating to the adjustments to a rural community.\r\nNevertheless, it seems that there is much more progress being made in\r\nthese schools than in those in the city. Baily in his _Race Orthodoxy\r\nin the South_ describes a visit to what he terms a typical rural\r\nschool.[31] \"There were no desks and only a small fragment of a\r\nblackboard in one corner. The teacher showed signs of having very\r\nlittle education himself and used no methods whatsoever in teaching.\r\nThere was only one whole book for the entire reading class. The pupils\r\ncame at all hours of the day and left whenever convenient for them.\r\nWhen the teacher was asked how many pupils were enrolled in the\r\nschool, he answered that there were sixty.\" Mr. Bailey remarks that,\r\nafter glancing over the room, he fancied there were sixty \"acomin' and\r\nagoin'.\"\r\n\r\nThe Negroes in the rural communities have practically no literature\r\nwith the possible exception of a few patent inside newspapers carried\r\non by the heads of one or the other Negro orders.[32] The amount of\r\nelevating reading matter may be judged by the type of advertisements\r\nwhich run along the line of \"hair-dressing that makes kinky hair soft,\r\npliant and glossy,\" and also of experiments of surgeons with the X-ray\r\nin making black skin white. Among the books furnished in the schools,\r\nnothing contained in them relates in any way to rural life.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 in North Carolina the average length of term for the rural\r\nNegro school was 82.1 days,--the average length for all Negro schools,\r\nincluding high schools, being 93 days. In this State there are 195 log\r\nschoolhouses and 2,216 of the Negro schoolhouses are furnished with\r\nhome-made desks and benches. The rural Negro teacher receives an\r\naverage salary of $22.48 per month and the city Negro teacher receives\r\nbut $30.20.[33] The conditions in the agricultural communities in the\r\nNorth seem to be better than those in the South. 20,700,000 ruralites\r\nin the South average 7,000,000 children of school age, 4,400,000 of\r\nwhom are enrolled in school with an average attendance of 2,700,000.\r\nIn the North, on the other hand, 20,700,000 ruralites average\r\n6,000,000 children, 4,500,000 of whom are enrolled, with an average\r\nattendance of 3,200,000. For the South there are 92,000 school\r\nteachers, whereas there are 158,000 in the North. School property in\r\nthe South is valued at $42,000,000 and in the North at $217,000,000.\r\nThe school revenue is $26,000,000 and $92,000,000 respectively. Per\r\ncapita expenditure in the South is under $10 and in the North it is\r\nalmost $30. The South spends only 16 cents on each $100 valuation, and\r\nthe North 20 cents.[34]\r\n\r\nMany signs of progress are visible in the South, due mainly to the\r\ninfluence of industrial institute graduates who attempt to reorganize\r\nthe rural districts with more or less success. One graduate of\r\nTuskegee seems to have met with unusual success in Hinds County,\r\nMississippi.[35] The Negroes in this community outnumber the white\r\npopulation seven to one, but out of 40,000 of the inhabitants 13,000\r\ncan neither read nor write. In five years this graduate has built up\r\nan industrial school with a farm of 1,500 acres, three large and\r\neleven small buildings, one large plantation house and thirty farm\r\nhouses. The school property is valued at $75,000, and he has started\r\nan endowment fund in order to make the work permanent. In Macon\r\nCounty, Alabama, improvements have been rapid. In five years' time\r\nthrough the influence of a changed school system the value of the land\r\nhas risen from $2 an acre to $15 and $20. It is reported that crime\r\nhas been reduced to a negligible quantity. At the last sitting of the\r\ngrand jury there were only 17 cases of all kinds.[36] The \"Rising\r\nStar\" School in West Virginia through a change in teacher and\r\ncurriculum has affected the community in as equally astonishing\r\nmanner. Not only are the homes of the farmers improved, but the number\r\nof land-owning citizens has also increased. Even the religion preached\r\nhas been greatly changed with the introduction of industrial\r\ntraining.[37] There is one school fund which is for the purpose of\r\nimproving rural conditions, that is the Jeanes Fund amounting to\r\n$1,000,000, the interest on which is to be used for the rural schools\r\nin supplying competent teachers as supervisors to introduce industrial\r\ntraining. The influence of this fund together with the influence of\r\nHampton and Tuskegee Institutes seems to be the hope of the future for\r\nthe rural districts.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of secondary education, high schools for the Negroes are\r\npractically lacking. In Atlanta with a Negro population of 51,902\r\nNegroes; in Savannah with 33,246; and in Augusta with 18,344, there\r\nare no Negro high schools whatsoever.[38] The following table shows\r\nthe distribution of the 156 high schools for Negroes[39] (1913):\r\n\r\n  Alabama                    6     Maryland                    1\r\n  Arkansas                   4     Mississippi                10\r\n  Delaware                   1     Missouri                   14\r\n  District of Columbia       2     North Carolina              3\r\n  Florida                    6     Ohio                        1\r\n  Georgia                   14     Oklahoma                    5\r\n  Illinois                   5     Pennsylvania                1\r\n  Indiana                    6     South Carolina             13\r\n  Kansas                     1     Tennessee                   9\r\n  Kentucky                   8     Texas                      37\r\n  Louisiana                  1     Virginia                    4\r\n                   West Virginia              5\r\n\r\nThe increase in the number of high schools in the Southern States from\r\nyear to year is shown by the following:[40]\r\n\r\n  ============+==============+============+==============\r\n    Year      | High Schools |  Year      | High Schools\r\n  ------------+--------------+------------+--------------\r\n   1899-1900  |     92       | 1905-1906  |    129\r\n   1900-1901  |    100       | 1906-1907  |    121\r\n   1901-1902  |     99       | 1907-1908  |    106\r\n   1902-1903  |    123       | 1908-1909  |    112\r\n   1903-1904  |    131       | 1909-1910  |    141\r\n   1904-1905  |    146       |            |\r\n  ------------+--------------+------------+--------------\r\n\r\nApparently there is no effort in the South to supply high schools for\r\nthe Negro. The General Assembly of Georgia passed a bill to establish\r\nhigh schools in all of the congressional districts of the State.\r\nEleven were established and supported by a fertilizer tax, most of\r\nwhich was paid by the Negroes who numbered 45.1 per cent of the\r\npopulation of the State, and 80 per cent of whom lived in the rural\r\ndistricts. None of these schools, however, were for members of the\r\nNegro race.[41]\r\n\r\nThe founding of the two most important industrial schools has been\r\nmentioned before. Hampton Institute which was founded by the American\r\nMissionary Society in 1868 now consists of 113 buildings, including\r\nthe instructors' cottages.[42] 76 of these buildings were erected by\r\nstudent labor. There are 120 acres to the Home Farm and 600 acres to\r\nShellbanks, six miles from the Institute. The enrollment in 1910 was\r\n875, or 1,399 including the Normal Practice School. Tuskegee Institute\r\nwhich began with one hoe and a blind mule now possesses 2,000 acres of\r\nland, 800 of which are cultivated each year by the young men of the\r\nschool. During 1903, 33 trades were taught to over 1,400 men and\r\nwomen. By means of this work, the students pay more than one half of\r\ntheir expenses. Of the sixty buildings, all but four were almost\r\nwholly erected by students, even to the making of the bricks.[43]\r\nAlthough the average Negro was greatly antagonistic regarding this\r\ntraining at the beginning of the work at these institutes and many\r\nprotests were heard from all sides, Mr. Washington stated in _The\r\nNegro Problem_ that it has been several years since they have received\r\na protest from parents against teaching industrial training.[44] The\r\ngraduates of Tuskegee have established more than fifteen similar\r\nschools in the South.[45] Among those established are Voorhees\r\nIndustrial School, Robert Hungerford School, Snow Hill Normal and\r\nIndustrial Institute, Topeka Normal and Industrial Institute, Port\r\nRoyal Agricultural School, and Mt. Meigs Institute.\r\n\r\nNo one of the Negro institutions for higher learning has as yet become\r\na fully equipped university. No one of the institutions maintains a\r\ngraduate school. Howard University is the only one that has even\r\nstarted graduate work.[46] The real influence of the college has been\r\nto prepare men to be leaders in education, as may be witnessed by the\r\nfact that out of the 5,000 Negro college graduates in the United\r\nStates 54 per cent are teaching, while 20 per cent are preaching.[47]\r\nThe following table shows the number of college graduates by\r\ndecades:[48]\r\n\r\n  ==========+===============+==========+===============\r\n   Year     | No. of Grads. | Year     | No. of Grads.\r\n  ----------+---------------+----------+---------------\r\n   1820-29  |     3         | 1870-79  |    313\r\n   1830-39  |    --         | 1880-89  |    738\r\n   1840-49  |     7         | 1892-99  |  1,126\r\n   1850-59  |    12         | 1900-09  |  1,610\r\n   1860-69  |    44         |          |\r\n            |               +----------+---------------\r\n            |               | Total    |  3,856\r\n  ----------+---------------+----------+---------------\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the college Negro is indicated in the\r\nfollowing:[49]\r\n\r\n  Districts                           No. of Graduates\r\n\r\n  New England States                          16\r\n  So-Northern Atlantic States                 42\r\n  No-Southern Atlantic States                 92\r\n  So-Southern Atlantic States                276\r\n  E-Northern Central States                   61\r\n  W-Northern Central States                   47\r\n  E-Southern Central States                  141\r\n  W-Southern Central States                   99\r\n  Rocky Mountain States                        2\r\n  Basin and Plateau States                     3\r\n  Pacific States                               3\r\n  Outside U.

Of 2,964 graduates of 34 Negro colleges, 82.7 per cent have\r\nbeen men and 17.3 have been women.[50] This difference may be due to a\r\ngreater economic standard of the Negro in the North, since the\r\ncolleges admitting Negroes which are not Negro institutions would be\r\nin the North, and to the fact that more Negroes would be located near\r\neducational institutions in the North than they would be in the South.\r\n\r\nFrom another report the average age for the women graduates was 21-1/3\r\nyears, and the average for the men was 22-3/16 years. There seems to\r\nbe a tendency of the age to increase, as shown by the following:[51]\r\n\r\n  1880-1890 the average age was 21 years for men and women.\r\n  1890-1900 the average age was 22 years for men and women.\r\n  1900-1910 the average age was 22-4/10 years for men and women.\r\n\r\nOf the 24 graduates reported 16 were under 35, and one was over 50.\r\n\r\nOf 799 graduates 67.3 per cent of the males were married, and 31.1 per\r\ncent of the females were married. Among these graduates there are only\r\ntwo cases of divorce, one man and one woman. The ages at which they\r\nmarried were for the men between 25 and 34 and for the women between\r\n20 and 29. The families averaged four children. The death rate among\r\nthe children has not equalled one child per family.[52]\r\n\r\nStatistics taken in 1913 of 258 schools show the college students to\r\nbe only 4.1 per cent of the entire number of Negroes in schools. If\r\nthe college graduate were in proportion to the population their number\r\nwould be about five times as great as it is at present.[53]\r\n\r\nThe Negroes have contributed in all lines to a large extent toward\r\ntheir own education. Since 1865 religious and philanthropic\r\nassociations have contributed $57,000,000 and the Negroes by direct\r\ncontributions have supplied $24,000,000.[54] In 1869 in one year the\r\nNegroes raised $200,000 for the construction of school houses. A\r\nreport from a State Superintendent of Schools of Florida stated that\r\nin the Black Belt Counties the Negro schools cost $19,457 and the\r\ndirect and indirect contributions on the part of the Negroes amounted\r\nto $23,984. There were $4,527 remaining which was used for the benefit\r\nof the white schools.[55] It is thought on the part of some that the\r\nNegro, although he may not pay in direct taxes a sum sufficient to\r\nprovide for his schools, may in reality be paying his full share\r\nindirectly. I believe, however, that it is quite safe to say that he\r\nprobably pays as much for his education as any other poor class of the\r\npopulation, especially so in comparison with some of the immigrant\r\nclasses. There have also been quite a number of Negro philanthropists,\r\nthe most prominent of whom have been Bishop Payne who gave several\r\nthousand dollars to Wilberforce, Wheeling Grant who gave $5,000 to\r\nWilberforce, Mary E. Shaw who left $38,000 to Tuskegee, Nancy Addison\r\nwho left $15,000 for education in Baltimore, Louis Bode who left\r\n$30,000 and George Washington of Jerseyville, Illinois, who left\r\n$15,000 for education. Thomy Lafon, of New Orleans, left $413,000 to\r\nbe used for educational purposes with no distinction regarding race or\r\ncolor. Colonel John McKee, of Philadelphia, left about $1,000,000 in\r\nreal estate to be used for education.[56] The Negro Baptist Churches\r\nalone raised in 1907 $149,332.75.[57] In nine years the Negro students\r\npaid in cash to 74 Negro institutions $3,358,667 and in work\r\n$1,828,602, making a total of $5,187,269. This amounted to 44.6 per\r\ncent of the entire running expenses of the institutions.[58]\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Negro immediately after the war was that of\r\nopposition to all kinds of labor. He had not as then learned the\r\ndistinction between working as a slave and working as a freedman. What\r\nhe wanted most was an education, a literary education, such as the\r\nwhite man had. He did not want his education for any definite purpose,\r\nexcept as an end in itself. The chief reason probably may have been\r\nthat of a desire to put himself on a par with the white man, and to\r\nprove his intellectual equality. The attitude to-day is radically\r\ndifferent, being represented by men like Washington and DuBois.\r\nWashington preached the gospel of industrial education, believing\r\nstrongly that that method would lead to an increase of the economic\r\nwealth of the race, whereby they could acquire the so-called higher\r\neducation. DuBois, however, although he believed in the efficiency of\r\nindustrial training, also felt that the race should not neglect to\r\neducate leaders even at the present time, so that his attitude differs\r\nfrom that of Washington in a slight degree. Two short quotations from\r\nWashington's writings may illustrate to a certain extent the attitude\r\nof the leaders of Negro education: \"What Negro education needed most,\"\r\nsaid he, \"was not so much more schools or different kinds of schools,\r\nas an educational policy and a school system,[59] and \"I want to see\r\neducation as common as grass, and as free for all as sunshine and\r\nrain.[60]\r\n\r\nPrejudice is an important factor in the attitude of the white race\r\ntoward Negro education. This prejudice seems to be in all sections of\r\nthe country, but it is the southerner who is heard from the most,\r\npossibly because he is more in contact with the real problem and then\r\nbecause it seems to be a policy of southern politicians to attempt to\r\noutdo each other in their speeches along the line of race prejudice.\r\nAccording to Weatherford prejudice has arisen out of the fear that\r\neducation will lead to the dominance of the Negro in politics and to\r\npromiscuous mingling in social life. \"The southern white man will\r\nnever be enthusiastic for Negro education, until he is convinced that\r\nsuch education will not lead to either of these.\"[61] This feeling of\r\na group is expressed in the following statement in a report to the\r\nBaltimore Council by a committee in 1913: \"No fault is found with the\r\nNegroes' ambitions,\" said the report, \"but the Committee feels that\r\nBaltimoreans will be criminally negligent as to their future\r\nhappiness, if they suffer the Negroes' ambitions to go unchecked.\"[62]\r\nMr. Thomas Dixon, Junior, deplores the fact that Washington was\r\ntraining the Negroes to be \"masters of men,\" stating that \"if there is\r\none thing the southern white man cannot endure it is an educated\r\nNegro.\"[63]\r\n\r\nSchool officials and educators on the other hand show an entirely\r\ndifferent attitude. Mr. Glenn, recently Superintendent of Education of\r\nGeorgia, made the declaration that \"The Negro is ... teachable and\r\nsusceptible to the same kind of mental improvement characteristic to\r\nany other race.\"[64] Thomas Nelson Page states that \"the Negro may\r\nindividually attain a fair and in uncommon instances a considerable\r\ndegree of mental development.\"[65] Another states that \"We must\r\neducate him because ignorant men are dangerous, especially to a\r\ndemocracy pledged to educate all men.\"[66] Some believe that we must\r\nalso educate him for self-protection from vice and disease. The\r\nSouthern Educational Association in 1907 passed the following\r\nresolution: \"We endorse the accepted policy of the States of the South\r\nin providing educational facilities for the youth of the Negro race,\r\nbelieving that whatever the ultimate solution of this grievous problem\r\nmay be, education must be an important factor in that solution.\"[67]\r\n\r\nIlliteracy which in 1863 equaled about 95 per cent of the Negro\r\npopulation has been decreasing rapidly since the Civil War. The\r\nilliteracy of the Negro during the last three decades has been as\r\nfollows: in 1890, 57.1 per cent; in 1900, 44.5 per cent; and in 1910,\r\n30.4 per cent. In the North in 1910 the illiteracy was 18.2 per cent\r\nin the South 48.0 per cent, and in the West 13.1 per cent.[68] The\r\nurban Negro in 1910 showed 17.6 per cent illiteracy and the rural 36.5\r\nper cent. Louisiana showed 48 per cent, whereas Minnesota and Oregon\r\nshowed only 3.4 per cent.[69] In 1900 when the Negro illiteracy was\r\n44.5 per cent, the children between ten and twenty-five years of age\r\nshowed only 30 per cent and those between 10 and 14 years in\r\nMississippi showed only 22 per cent.[70] The illiteracy for all Negro\r\nchildren was 25 per cent, whereas the illiteracy for all white\r\nchildren was only 10.5 per cent.[71] The illiteracy of our Negroes\r\ndoes not seem so great when a comparison is made with some foreign\r\ncountries:[72]\r\n\r\n  Race              Illiteracy\r\n\r\n  Negroes              30.4\r\n  Bulgaria             65.5\r\n  Greece               57.2\r\n  Hungary              40.9\r\n  Italy                48.2\r\n  Poland               59.3\r\n  Portugal             73.4\r\n  Russia               70.0\r\n  Servia               78.9\r\n  Spain                58.7\r\n  Chile                49.9\r\n  Cuba                 56.8\r\n  Mexico               75.3\r\n  Porto Rico           79.6\r\n  India                92.5\r\n  Philippines          55.5\r\n  Cape of Good Hope    65.8\r\n  Egypt                92.7\r\n\r\nThe percentage of Negro illiteracy in America is less than any one of\r\nthese foreign races.\r\n\r\nThe criminality of the Negro seemingly has decreased as the illiteracy\r\nhas decreased. Out of every 100 criminals only 39 could read and 61\r\ncould not, whereas in the general population 43 could read and 57\r\ncould not.[73] In the Mississippi penitentiary where they had 450\r\nconvicts of Negro blood one half of them could neither read nor write,\r\nand less than 10 per cent had anything like a fair education.[74]\r\nAtlanta University has graduated 800 Negro men and women, not one of\r\nwhom has ever been convicted of crime. Fisk University has only one\r\ngraduate who has ever been convicted. Greensboro Agricultural and\r\nTechnical College has had 2,000 students since its establishment, and\r\nonly five have ever been convicted of crime. Two of these had been\r\nexpelled students, and none were among the three hundred graduates of\r\nthe college. Negro students who have gone to high school show a\r\nremarkably low percentage of crime. Of the 200 graduates from the\r\nWinston-Salem High School (North Carolina) only one has a criminal\r\nrecord. Waters Normal Institute at Winton, North Carolina, has\r\ngraduated more than 130 students and not one of these has ever been\r\narrested or convicted of any crime.[75] The records of the southern\r\nprisons show that at least 90 per cent of those in prison are without\r\ntrades of any sort.[76] According to Booker T. Washington, \"Manual\r\ntraining is as good a prevention of criminality as vaccination is of\r\nsmallpox.\"[77] In 1903, in Gloucester County, Virginia, twenty-five\r\nyears after education had been introduced, there were 30 arrests for\r\nmisdemeanors, 16 white and 14 black; and in the next year there were\r\n15 arrests for misdemeanors, 14 white and one black.[78] The general\r\nopinion of the southerner may be judged by the answers to a\r\nquestionnaire sent out to prominent southern men in each of the\r\nSouthern States. To the question \"Does crime grow less as education\r\nincreases?\" there were 102, answered \"yes\" and 19 answered \"no.\"[79]\r\n\r\nOne of the charges against the Negro has been his shiftlessness, both\r\nas far as his personal industriousness is concerned, and as far as the\r\ncare of his home and things about him. Now, however, education has\r\nincreased his standards and his wants, so that since he desires to\r\nhave land, homes, churches, books, papers, and education for his\r\nchildren, he will labor regularly and efficiently to supply these. The\r\ngraduates of Tuskegee Institute are kept in touch with by one of the\r\nschool officials, who reported that not 10 per cent could be found in\r\nidleness and that only one was in a penitentiary.[80]\r\n\r\n                                             LORETTA FUNKE\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In the preparation of this manuscript the following books have\r\nbeen useful: Thomas P.

While the\r\nfree Negro population of the North increased by nearly 30,000 in the\r\ndecade after 1850, the gain was chiefly in three States, Ohio,\r\nMichigan and Illinois. Connecticut had fewer free people of color in\r\n1860 than in 1850 and there were half a dozen other States that barely\r\nheld their own during the period. The three States showing gains were\r\nthose bordering on Canada where the runaway slave or the free man of\r\ncolor in danger could flee when threatened. It is estimated that from\r\nfifteen to twenty thousand Negroes entered Canada between 1850 and\r\n1860, increasing the Negro population of the British provinces from\r\nabout 40,000 to nearly 60,000. The greater part of the refugee\r\npopulation settled in the southwestern part of the present province of\r\nOntario, chiefly in what now comprises the counties of Essex and Kent,\r\nbordering on the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair. This large\r\nmigration of an alien race into a country more sparsely settled than\r\nany of the Northern States might have been expected to cause trouble,\r\nbut records show that the Canadians received the refugees with\r\nkindness and gave them what help they could.[2] At the close of the\r\nCivil War many of the Negroes in exile returned, thus relieving the\r\nsituation in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Fugitive Slave Bill had been signed but a month when Garrison\r\npointed out in _The Liberator_ that a northward trek of free people of\r\ncolor was already under way. \"Alarmed at the operation of the new\r\nFugitive Slave Law, the fugitives from slavery are pressing northward.\r\nMany have been obliged to flee precipitately leaving behind them all\r\nthe little they have acquired since they escaped from slavery.\"[3] The\r\nAmerican Anti-Slavery Society's report also notes the consternation\r\ninto which the Negro population was thrown by the new legislation[4]\r\nand from many other contemporary sources there may be obtained\r\ninformation showing the distressing results that followed immediately\r\nupon the signing of the bill. Reports of the large number of new\r\narrivals were soon coming from Canada. Hiram Wilson, a missionary at\r\nSt. Catharines, writing in _The Liberator_ of December 13, 1850, says:\r\n\"Probably not less than 3,000 have taken refuge in this country since\r\nthe first of September. Only for the attitude of the north there would\r\nhave been thousands more.\" He says that his church is thronged with\r\nfugitives and that what is true of his own district is true also of\r\nother parts of southern Ontario. Henry Bibb, in his paper _The Voice\r\nof the Fugitive_[5] published frequent reports of the number of\r\nfugitives arriving at Sandwich on the Detroit River. In the issue of\r\nDecember 3,1851, he reports 17 arrivals in a week. On April 22, 1852,\r\nhe records 15 arrivals within the last few days and notes that \"the\r\nUnderground Railroad is doing good business this spring.\" On May 20,\r\n1852, he reports \"quite an accession of refugees to our numbers during\r\nthe last two weeks\" and on June 17 notes the visit of agents from\r\nChester, Pennsylvania, preparatory to the movement of a large number\r\nof people of color from that place to Canada. On the same date he\r\nsays: \"Numbers of free persons of color are arriving in Canada from\r\nPennsylvania and the District of Columbia, Ohio and Indiana. Sixteen\r\npassed by Windsor on the seventh and 20 on the eighth and the cry is\r\n'Still they come.'\" The immigration was increasing week by week, for\r\non July 1 it was reported in _The Voice of the Fugitive_ that \"in a\r\nsingle day last week there were not less than 65 colored emigrants\r\nlanded at this place from the south.... As far as we can learn not\r\nless than 200 have arrived within our vicinity since last issue.\"\r\nAlmost every number of the paper during 1852 gives figures as to the\r\narrivals of the refugees. On September 23 Bibb reported the arrival of\r\nthree of his own brothers while on November 4, 1852, there is recorded\r\nthe arrival of 23 men, women and children in 48 hours. Writing to _The\r\nLiberator_ of November 12, 1852, Mary E. Bibb said that during the\r\nlast ten days they had sheltered 23 arrivals in their own home. The\r\nAmerican Missionary Association, which had workers among the fugitives\r\nin Canada noted in its annual report for 1852 that there had been a\r\nlarge increase of the Negro population during the year[6] while\r\nfurther testimony to the great activity along the border is given by\r\nthe statement that the Vigilance Committee at Detroit assisted 1,200\r\nrefugees in one year and that the Cleveland Vigilance Committee had a\r\nrecord of assisting more than a hundred a month to freedom.[7]\r\n\r\nThe northern newspapers of the period supply abundant information\r\nregarding the consternation into which the Negroes were thrown and\r\ntheir movements to find places of safety. Two weeks after President\r\nFillmore had signed the Fugitive Slave Bill a Pittsburgh despatch to\r\n_The Liberator_ stated that \"nearly all the waiters in the hotels have\r\nfled to Canada. Sunday 30 fled; on Monday 40; on Tuesday 50; on\r\nWednesday 30 and up to this time the number that has left will not\r\nfall short of 300. They went in large bodies, armed with pistols and\r\nbowie knives, determined to die rather than be captured.\"[8] A\r\nHartford despatch of October 18, 1850, told of five Negroes leaving\r\nthat place for Canada;[9] Utica reported under date of October 2 that\r\n16 fugitive slaves passed through on a boat the day before, bound for\r\nCanada, all well armed and determined to fight to the last;[10] _The\r\nEastport Sentinel_ of March 12 noted that a dozen fugitives had\r\ntouched there on the steamer _Admiral_, en route to St. John's; _The\r\nNew Bedford Mercury_ said: \"We are pleased to announce that a very\r\nlarge number of fugitive slaves, aided by many of our most wealthy and\r\nrespected citizens have left for Canada and parts unknown and that\r\nmany more are on the point of departure.\"[11] The Concord, New\r\nHampshire, _Statesman_ reported: \"Last Tuesday seven fugitives from\r\nslavery passed through this place ... and they probably reached Canada\r\nin safety on Wednesday last. Scarcely a day passes but more or less\r\nfugitives escape from the land of slavery to the freedom of Canada ...\r\nvia this place over the track of the Northern Railroad.\"[12]\r\n\r\nMany other examples of the effect of the Fugitive Slave Act might be\r\nnoted. The Negro population of Columbia, Pennsylvania, dropped from\r\n943 to 487 after the passing of the bill.[13] The members of the Negro\r\ncommunity near Sandy Lake in northwestern Pennsylvania, many of whom\r\nhad farms partly paid for, sold out or gave away their property and\r\nwent in a body to Canada.[14] In Boston a fugitive slave congregation\r\nunder Leonard A. Grimes had a church built when the blow fell. More\r\nthan forty members fled to Canada.[15] Out of one Baptist church in\r\nBuffalo more than 130 members fled across the border, a similar\r\nmigration taking place among the Negro Methodists of the same city\r\nthough they were more disposed to make a stand. At Rochester all but\r\ntwo of the 114 members of the Negro Baptist church fled, headed by\r\ntheir pastor, while at Detroit the Negro Baptist church lost 84\r\nmembers, some of whom abandoned their property in haste to get\r\naway.[16] A letter from William Still, agent of the Philadelphia\r\nVigilance Committee, to Henry Bibb at Sandwich says there is much talk\r\nof emigration to Canada as the best course for the fugitives.[17] _The\r\nCorning Journal_ illustrates the aid that was given to the fugitives\r\nby northern friends. Fifteen fugitives, men, women and children, came\r\nin by train and stopped over night. In the morning a number of Corning\r\npeople assisted them to Dunkirk and sent a committee to arrange for\r\npassage to Canada. The captain of the lake steamer upon which they\r\nembarked, very obligingly stopped at Fort Maiden, on the Canadian\r\nside, for wood and water and the runaways walked ashore to freedom.\r\n\"The underground railroad is in fine working order,\" is the comment of\r\n_The Journal_. \"Rarely does a collision occur, and once on the track\r\npassengers are sent through between sunrise and sunset.\" That time did\r\nnot dull the terrors of the Fugitive Slave Act is shown by the fact\r\nthat every fresh arrest would cause a panic in its neighborhood. At\r\nChicago in 1861, almost on the eve of the Civil War, more than 100\r\nNegroes left on a single train following the arrest of a fugitive,\r\ntaking nothing with them but the clothes on their backs and most of\r\nthem leaving good situations behind.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe Underground Railroad system was never so successful in all its\r\nhistory as after 1850. Despite the law, and the infamous activities of\r\nmany of the slave-catchers, at least 3,000 fugitives got through to\r\nCanada within three months after the bill was signed. This was the\r\nestimate of both Henry Bibb and Hiram Wilson and there were probably\r\nno men in Canada who were better acquainted with the situation than\r\nthese two. In _The Voice of the Fugitive_ of November 5, 1851, Bibb\r\nreported that \"the road is doing better business this fall than usual.\r\nThe Fugitive Slave Law has given it more vitality, more activity, more\r\npassengers and more opposition which invariably accelerates\r\nbusiness.... We can run a lot of slaves through from almost any of the\r\nbordering slave states into Canada within 48 hours and we defy the\r\nslaveholders and their abettors to beat that if they can.... We have\r\njust received a fresh lot today and still there is room.\" _The Troy\r\nArgus_ learned from \"official sources\" in 1859 that the Underground\r\nRailroad had been doing an unusually large business that year.[19]\r\nBibb's newspaper reports, December 2, 1852, that the underground is\r\nworking well. \"Slaveholders are frequently seen and heard, howling on\r\ntheir track up to the Detroit River's edge but dare not venture over\r\nlest the British lion should lay his paw upon their guilty heads.\"\r\nBibb kept a watchful eye on slave-catchers coming to the Canadian\r\nborder and occasionally reported their presence in his paper.\r\nUnderground activity was also noted in _The Liberator_. \"The\r\nunderground railroad and especially the express train, is doing a good\r\nbusiness just now. We have good and competent conductors,\" was a\r\nstatement in the issue of October 29, 1852.[20]\r\n\r\nNot all those who fled to Canada left their property behind. _The\r\nVoice of the Fugitive_ makes frequent reference to Negroes arriving\r\nwith plenty of means to take care of themselves. \"Men of capital with\r\ngood property, some of whom are worth thousands, are settling among us\r\nfrom the northern states.\" says the issue of October 22, 1851, while\r\nin the issue of July 1, 1852, it is noted that \"22 from Indiana\r\npassed through to Amherstburg, with four fine covered waggons and\r\neight horses. A few weeks ago six or eight such teams came from the\r\nsame state into Canada. The Fugitive Slave Law is driving out brains\r\nand money.\" In a later issue it was stated \"we know of several\r\nfamilies of free people of color who have moved here from the northern\r\nstates this summer who have brought with them property to the amount\r\nof L30,000.\"[21] Some of these people with property joined the Elgin\r\nAssociation settlement at Buxton, purchasing farms and taking\r\nadvantage of the opportunities that were provided there for education.\r\nA letter to _The Voice of the Fugitive_ from Ezekiel C. Cooper,\r\nrecently arrived at Buxton, says: \"Canada is the place where we have\r\nour rights.\"[22] He speaks of having purchased 50 acres of land and\r\npraises the school and its teacher at Buxton. Cooper came from\r\nNorthampton, Massachusetts, driven out by the Fugitive Slave Law. A\r\nrather unusual case was that of 12 manumitted slaves who were brought\r\nto Canada from the South. They had been bequeathed $1,000 each by\r\ntheir former owner. They all bought homes in the Niagara district.[23]\r\n\r\nWhile fugitives and free Negroes were being harried in the Northern\r\nStates slaves continued to run away from their masters and seek\r\nliberty. \"Slaves are making this a great season for running off to\r\nPennsylvania,\" said the Cumberland, Virginia, _Unionist_ in 1851.[24]\r\n\"A large number have gone in the last week, most of whom were not\r\nrecaptured.\" At the beginning of 1851 _The Liberator_ had a Buffalo\r\ndespatch to the effect that 87 runaways from the South had passed\r\nthrough to Canada since the passing of the bill the previous\r\nSeptember.[25] Bibb mentions two runaways from North Carolina who were\r\n101 days reaching Canada.[26] The Detroit _Free Press_ reported that\r\n29 runaways crossed to Canada about the end of March, 1859, \"the first\r\ninstallment of northern emigration from North Carolina.\"[27] About the\r\nsame time _The Detroit Advertiser_ announced that \"seventy fugitive\r\nslaves arrived in Canada by one train from the interior of Tennessee.\r\nA week before a company of 12 arrived. At nearly the same time a party\r\nof seven and another of five were safely landed on the free soil of\r\nCanada, making 94 in all. The underground railroad was never before\r\ndoing so flourishing a business.\"[28] The New Orleans _Commercial\r\nBulletin_ of December 19, 1860, asserted that 1,500 slaves had escaped\r\nannually for the last fifty years, a loss to the South of at least\r\n$40,000,000. The American Anti-Slavery Society's twenty-seventh report\r\nsaid \"Northward migration from slave land during the last year has\r\nfully equalled the average of former years.\"[29]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that several of the most famous cases that\r\narose under the Fugitive Slave Act had their ending in Canada.\r\nShadrack, Anthony Burns, Jerry McHenry, the Parkers, the Lemmon slaves\r\nand others found refuge across the border after experiencing the\r\nterrors of the Fugitive Slave legislation. The Shadrack incident was\r\none of the earliest to arise under the new law. Shadrack, a Negro\r\nemploye in a Boston coffee house, was arrested on February 15, 1851,\r\non the charge of having escaped from slavery in the previous May. As\r\nthe commissioner before whom he was brought was not ready to proceed,\r\nthe case was adjourned for three days. As Massachusetts had forbidden\r\nthe use of her jails in fugitive cases Shadrack was detained in the\r\nUnited States court room at the court house. A mob of people of color\r\nbroke into the building, rescued the prisoner and he escaped to\r\nCanada. The rescue caused great excitement at Washington and five of\r\nthe rescuers were indicted and tried but the jury disagreed. The\r\nincident showed that the new law would be enforced with difficulty in\r\nMassachusetts in view of the fact that the mob had been supported by a\r\nVigilance Committee of most respectable citizens.[30]\r\n\r\nA few months later, at Syracuse, a respectable man of color named\r\nJerry McHenry was arrested as a fugitive on the complaint of a slaver\r\nfrom Missouri. He made an attempt to escape and failed. The town,\r\nhowever, was crowded with people who had come to a meeting of the\r\nCounty Agricultural Society and to attend the annual convention of the\r\nLiberty Party. On the evening of October 1, 1851, a descent was made\r\nupon the jail by a party led by Gerrit Smith and Rev. Samuel J. May,\r\nboth well-known abolitionists. The Negro was rescued, concealed for a\r\nfew days and then sent on to Canada where he died, at Kingston, in\r\n1853.[31]\r\n\r\nA more tragic incident was that known as the Gorsuch case. A slaver\r\nnamed Gorsuch, with his son and some others, all armed, came to\r\nLancaster, Pennsylvania, in search of two fugitives. In a house two\r\nmiles from Lancaster was a Negro family named Parker and they were\r\nbesieged by the Gorsuchs. The Negroes blew a horn and brought others\r\nto their help. Two Quakers who were present were called upon to render\r\nhelp in arresting the Negroes, as they were required to do under the\r\nAct, but they refused to aid. In the fighting that took place the\r\nelder Gorsuch was killed and his son wounded. The Negroes escaped to\r\nCanada where they spent the winter in Toronto and in the spring joined\r\nthe Elgin Association settlement at Buxton in Kent county.[32]\r\n\r\nThe Anthony Burns case attracted more attention than any other arising\r\nin the execution of the Fugitive Slave Law. Burns, who was a fugitive\r\nfrom Virginia living in Boston, betrayed his hiding place in a letter\r\nwhich fell into the hands of a southern slaver and was communicated to\r\na slave hunter. The slaver tried to coax Burns to go back to bondage\r\npeaceably but failing in this he had him arrested and brought before a\r\ncommissioner who, on June 2, 1854, decided that Burns was a fugitive\r\nand must be sent back to slavery. Boston showed its feelings on the\r\nday that the Negro was removed from jail to be sent South. Stores were\r\nclosed and draped in black, bells tolled, and across State Street a\r\ncoffin was suspended bearing the legend THE DEATH OF LIBERTY. The\r\nstreets were crowded and a large military force, with a field piece in\r\nfront, furnished escort for the lone black. Hisses and cries of \"\r\nshame\" came from the crowd as the procession passed. Burns was soon\r\nreleased from bondage, Boston people and others subscribing to\r\npurchase his liberty. He was brought North, educated and later entered\r\nthe ministry. For several years he was a missionary at St. Catharines,\r\nCanada, and died there in the sixties.[33]\r\n\r\nAlong the international boundary there were exciting incidents at\r\ntimes, fugitives being chased to the border and often having narrow\r\nescapes from recapture. The Monroe family, mother and several\r\ndaughters, escaped from slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and were carried\r\nby the Underground Railroad to Ann Arbor and on to Detroit, the master\r\nin hot pursuit. So close was the chase that as the runaways pulled out\r\nfrom the wharf on the ferry for Windsor, Canada, the master came\r\nrunning down the street crying out \"Stop them! stop them!\" He was\r\njeered at by the crowd which sympathized with the Negro woman.[34]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1852, three fugitives arrived in Detroit and in response to\r\nfrantic messages from Toledo were held for their pursuers. In\r\ndesperation the Negroes made a savage attack on their jailer, gained\r\ntheir freedom and got across the border with the assistance of friends\r\nin Detroit. Rewards that were offered for their recapture were\r\nuseless as the fugitives took care to remain on the Canadian side.[35]\r\n\r\nHiram Wilson tells of an incident that came under his notice at St.\r\nCatharines. A beautiful young girl, 14 years of age and almost white,\r\nwas brought to Buffalo as maid for a slaveholder's daughter travelling\r\nin the North. She was spirited off by some Buffalo abolitionists,\r\ntransferred to a steamer flying the British flag, and landed in\r\nCanada. She was taken to St. Catharines and sheltered in the home of\r\nHiram Wilson. The master came over from Buffalo bringing a couple of\r\nlawyers with him and tried to secure his property but his demands were\r\nrefused. The owner claimed that he valued the girl at $1,000. It was\r\nlater discovered that she had been sold no less than four times before\r\ncoming to Canada.[36]\r\n\r\nThe brutality of the Fugitive Slave Law was shown on more than one\r\noccasion along the border. A case that attracted much attention at the\r\ntime was that of Daniel Davis. He was cook on the steamer _Buckeye_.\r\nOne day while the vessel was in port at Buffalo he was called up from\r\nbelow. As his head appeared above the deck he was struck a heavy blow\r\nby a slave catcher named Benjamin Rust who had a warrant from a United\r\nStates commissioner for his arrest. The Negro fell back senseless into\r\nthe hold and on top of a stove, being badly burned. He was brought\r\ninto court at once and the newspaper accounts relate in detail how he\r\nsat during the proceedings \"dozing, with blood oozing out of his mouth\r\nand nostrils.\" After a trial that was rushed in a most unseemly way\r\nthe Negro was ordered delivered over to Rust, who was really agent for\r\none George H. Moore, of Louisville. The brutality of the whole\r\nproceeding stirred up deep interest in Buffalo and on a writ of habeas\r\ncorpus the fugitive was brought before Judge Conkling of the United\r\nStates Court at Auburn and released. Before there could be further\r\nsteps taken to hold the Negro he was hurried into Canada, where he\r\nremained. He was in attendance at the large Negro Convention held in\r\nToronto in September, 1851, and with his head still in bandages\r\nafforded striking evidence of the effects of the Slave Law. Rust,\r\nDavis's assailant, was afterwards indicted at Buffalo but allowed to\r\ngo after paying a paltry $50 fine.[37]\r\n\r\nAnother memorable border incident occurred at Sandusky, Ohio, in\r\nOctober, 1852. A party of fugitives, two men, two women and several\r\nchildren had been brought from Kentucky and were aboard the steamer\r\n_Arrow_ about to sail for Detroit when they were all arrested by the\r\nalleged owner and taken before the mayor of the town. Rush R. Sloane,\r\na local lawyer, offered to act in their defence. The proceedings were\r\nso hurried that no warrant or writ was ready to be produced in court\r\nand Sloane signified by a gesture that the Negroes were free. There\r\nwas an immediate rush for the door on the part of the fugitives and\r\ntheir friends, but even as they fled from the court room the claimant\r\nentered calling out: \"Here are the papers. I own the slaves. I'll hold\r\nyou personally responsible for their escape.\" The fugitives meanwhile\r\nhad gone to the harbor, entered a sailboat owned by friendly fishermen\r\nand were on their way to Canada. The slaver, frantic at seeing his\r\nproperty vanishing, tried in vain to get other fishermen to pursue\r\nthem. He then hurried to a neighboring town, trying to secure help,\r\nbut with no more success. Within a few hours the runaways were landed\r\nat Port Stanley, safe from all pursuers. The slaver made good his\r\nthreat to hold Sloane responsible for the loss of his property,\r\nentering action and securing a judgment for $3,000. It is related as\r\none of the pathetic incidents of this case that when the fugitives\r\nwere first taken off the steamer _Arrow_ one of the women dropped her\r\ninfant child on the ground and disowned it, hoping that it at least\r\nwould be free if she were condemned to return to slavery.[38]\r\n\r\nWith so great an influx of refugees into a country that was sparsely\r\nsettled, some suffering was inevitable, but contemporary evidence\r\nindicates that after all it was but slight. There was probably more\r\ndistress during the winter of 1850-1 than later on because of the\r\nlarge number who came in during the few months immediately after the\r\npassing of the Fugitive Slave Bill. In their haste to find safety many\r\nleft everything behind, entering Canada with little more than the\r\nclothes on their backs. A. L. Power, of Farmington, who visited\r\nWindsor at the beginning of 1851, found about a score of families\r\nliving in an old military barracks, most of them in need of both fuel\r\nand clothing. At Sandwich, near by, he also found distress and\r\nmentions seeing a family of eight children who were almost nude and\r\nwho were suffering from the cold.[39] Sickness was, in many cases, a\r\nresult of the exposure to which the Negroes had been subjected in\r\ntheir effort to reach Canada. Later on, the situation improved and by\r\n1855 the workers of the American Missionary Association reported that\r\n\"in general, those who have gone there from the United States, even\r\nthe fugitives, may provide for the wants of their families, after a\r\nshort residence there; especially if they meet a friendly hand and,\r\nmore than all, good counsel on their arrival.\"[40]\r\n\r\nVarious agencies in both the United States and Canada were active in\r\nthe work of relieving the distress among the newcomers. The American\r\nAnti-Slavery Society early addressed itself to this task. \"Several\r\nagents,\" said Bibb, \"have during the past year proceeded to Canada to\r\nexert the best influence in their power over the fugitives that have\r\nflocked to the province in years past and especially those who have\r\ngone the past year. They are supplied with the means of instructing\r\nthe colored population, clothing some of the most destitute fugitives\r\nand aiding them in various ways to obtain employment, procure and\r\ncultivate land and train up their children. Our friends in Canada are\r\nexerting a good influence in the same direction.\"[41]\r\n\r\nThe fugitives themselves were banded together to aid the newcomers.\r\nThe Windsor Anti-Slavery Society and the Fugitives' Union were both\r\norganized to relieve distress and assist their fellows in making a\r\nliving.[42] Supplies were sent in from points at considerable\r\ndistances in some cases, clothing, food, money, and in one case a\r\ndonation of 2,000 fruit trees from Henry Willis, of Battle Creek, for\r\nrefugees who were going on the land.[43] Michigan people were\r\nexceedingly generous in extending aid and there is record also of\r\nsupplies sent from Fall River, Whitestown, New Jersey, Boston and\r\nother places in New England. There was plenty of work for the Negroes,\r\nthe fifties being a period of railroad building in western Ontario, so\r\nthat writing in 1861, William Troy maintained, that nine tenths of the\r\nfugitives had got along without outside aid of any kind. \"The\r\nfugitives show a marked disposition to help each other and relieve\r\nwant,\" he says. \"I could show hundreds of instances of kindheartedness\r\nto all persons, irrespective of race.\"[44]\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada came largely as\r\na result of the sudden influx of Negroes after 1850 which, perhaps\r\nmore than anything else, impressed upon Canadians the great issue that\r\nwas rapidly dividing the neighboring republic. Beginning at Toronto\r\nthe anti-slavery forces in Canada were organized in the various cities\r\nand towns of the province and continued active until the Civil War.\r\nThere was developed in Canada a marked anti-slavery sentiment which\r\nmanifested itself in part in the very large number of Canadians who\r\nenlisted in the northern armies.[45] The Anti-Slavery Society was also\r\nactive in extending the helping hand to the fugitives, considerable\r\nsums being raised for relief purposes and support being given to\r\neducational and other movements designed to elevate the race.\r\n\r\nIn Canada the refugees were absolutely safe from the operations of the\r\nFugitive Slave Law. No loophole could be found in the Canadian law\r\nthat would permit the rendition of a slave. A famous case arose in the\r\nCanadian courts on the eve of the Civil War when a Negro, John\r\nAnderson, was arrested charged with the murder of a slaver named Diggs\r\nsome years before, the crime having been committed while Anderson was\r\ntrying to make his escape from slavery. Canadian opinion was much\r\naroused and though the first decision of the courts was that the Negro\r\nmust be extradited this finding was overruled from England and in the\r\nend the prisoner was released on a technicality. It was made quite\r\nclear that the British Government would view with marked disapproval\r\nany decision in Canada that would return a refugee to slavery.\r\n\r\nThere were doubtless numerous attempts to kidnap Negroes who had\r\nescaped to Canada, especially in the border towns, but such attempts\r\nmust have been rarely successful. An open attempt to induce a Canadian\r\nofficial to act as slave catcher was exposed in the _Montreal Gazette_\r\nof January 13, 1855, when there was published a letter written by one,\r\nJohn H. Pape, of Frederick, Maryland, to Sheriff Hays, of Montreal,\r\nproposing that the latter should use his power to arrest Negroes who\r\nwould then be turned over to Pape. The proceeds from the sale of the\r\ncaptured chattels would be divided evenly, according to the plan\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nCanadians took a measure of pride in the sense of security with which\r\ntheir Negro immigrants could look back at their pursuers. That the\r\nslavery issue in the United States was rapidly coming to a head was\r\nalso recognized in Canada during the fifties and this, too, may have\r\nbeen an influence with the Canadians in doing what they could to\r\nassist the great number of more or less helpless people who came among\r\nthem. Viewed in the light of more than half a century it can be seen\r\nthat the influence of Canada in determining the course of the slavery\r\nissue was by no means slight.\r\n\r\n                                             FRED LANDON\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] \"One of the most assailable laws ever passed by the Congress of\r\nthe United States ...

In 1779 his father, also named Richard,\r\ncame to Jamaica from Lincolnshire, where the family had lived for\r\nseveral centuries, and along with a brother settled at Montego Bay.\r\nThere he became a substantial merchant, and on his death in 1818 left\r\nhis property in Jamaica to his son and two daughters, Ann and Jane.\r\nHill's mother, who had East Indian as well as Negro blood in her\r\nveins, survived her husband many years, her son being constant in his\r\nattention to her up to the last.\r\n\r\nAt the early age of five Hill was sent to England to reside with his\r\nfather's relations then living at Cheshunt, there to remain till his\r\nfourteenth year when he was sent to the Elizabethan Grammar School at\r\nHorncastle to finish his education. Upon the death of his father in\r\n1818 Hill returned to Jamaica. Although his property came into the\r\npossession of his son and two daughters the father's death in some way\r\ninvolved Richard Hill in irksome money obligations which harassed him\r\nfor many years, and even after he had discharged them left a gloom\r\nover his life.\r\n\r\nHis father was a man in advance of his times, hating and deploring the\r\nintolerance and the tyranny that grew out of slavery as it then\r\nexisted in Jamaica. On his death-bed he made his son solemnly pledge\r\nhimself to devote his energies to the cause of freedom, and never to\r\nrest until those civil disabilities, under which the Negroes were\r\nlaboring, had been entirely removed; and, further, until slavery\r\nitself had received its death-blow.\r\n\r\nThe time and opportunity for fulfilling this pledge soon came, for in\r\nthe year 1823 the Negroes in Jamaica commenced their agitation for\r\nobtaining equal privileges with their white brethren. It does not\r\nappear that Hill attached himself openly to any of the societies that\r\nwere formed for the purpose of carrying on this agitation. But he\r\nfreely gave them the benefit of his abilities, helping the whole\r\nmovement with his advice and with his pen.[2]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1826 Hill visited Cuba, the United States and Canada, and\r\nthen went on to England, landing there in September. In 1827 he was\r\ndeputed by the organization in Jamaica to use his efforts in England\r\nto secure the assistance of the leading members of the Anti-Slavery\r\nparty. During his stay there he was on terms of close intimacy with\r\nWilberforce, Buxton, Clarkson, Babington, Lushington and Zachary\r\nMacaulay,[3] all members of the Anti-Slavery Society, as well as\r\nPringle and other men eminent for their philanthropy and talents and\r\nnoted for the deep interest they took in all that related to the\r\nelevation and welfare of the Negroes of the British West Indian\r\ncolonies. The petition from the people of color of this island to the\r\nHouse of Commons for the removal of their civil disabilities, was\r\nentrusted to Hill, who upon the occasion of presenting it was\r\npermitted \"within the bar\" of the House. On that occasion Canning\r\ndelivered his last speech a splendid effort in favor of the\r\npetitioners. Hill remained several years in England and contributed\r\nlargely by his pen and his speeches to enlighten the public mind of\r\nEngland as to the real character of West Indian slavery. But the\r\nremittances from the \"people of color\" in Jamaica, never very large,\r\nsoon became few and far between. So Hill, always independent in every\r\nway, even in his friendships and political alliances, maintained\r\nhimself and his sister, Jane, almost entirely by his contributions,\r\nliterary and scientific, to several popular newspapers and\r\nperiodicals.[4]\r\n\r\nAfter a residence of several years in England, Hill was sent by the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society on a visit to San Domingo, chiefly for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining by personal observation and inquiry what was\r\nthe actual social and political condition of the people of that\r\nisland.[5] But his commission had a more extensive object than that\r\nattached to it, which, however, directed him to obtain besides all the\r\ninformation he possibly could concerning the natural resources of\r\nevery part of the country through which he was to travel. San Domingo\r\nwas then under the wise and able rule of President Boyer, the whole\r\nisland forming one undivided republic, enjoying internal tranquillity,\r\nand being in a comparatively flourishing condition. On his way from\r\nEngland to Port-au-Prince, where he arrived on the sixteenth of June,\r\n1830, Hill visited France staying there a few months. He spent nearly\r\ntwo years in San Domingo travelling incessantly and making notes about\r\neverything. He has left more than one sketch-book full of sketches\r\nshowing a knowledge of perspective, a keen eye for the picturesque and\r\na true artist's feeling. He sailed from San Domingo for England on the\r\nthird of May, 1832, and then for Jamaica a few months after, never\r\nagain to quit his native country. In that year he was made justice of\r\nthe peace for Trelawny.\r\n\r\nHe was never greedy for money and seems to have been ill-paid for his\r\nlabors in San Domingo. Upon his return to Jamaica either on that\r\naccount or from motives of policy he ceased all communication with the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society, and only now and then did he write to one or two\r\nof its members, and even then more as personal friends than as old\r\npolitical allies.\r\n\r\nOn the third of February, 1834, Hill was appointed one of a number of\r\nforty stipendiary magistrates whose duty it was to adjudicate between\r\nthe former slaveholders and their \"apprentices.\"[6] This appointment\r\nhe held until the first of January, 1872. In this connection it may be\r\ninteresting to quote the opinion of Hill expressed by the Rev. James\r\nThome and J. H. Kimball, who in 1838 published for the American\r\nAnti-Slavery Society an account of _Emancipation in the West Indies: a\r\nsix months' tour in Antigua, Barbadoes and Jamaica in the year 1837_.\r\nThey say: \"We spent nearly a day with Richard Hill, Esq., the\r\nsecretary of the special magistrates' departments, of whom we have\r\nalready spoken. He is a colored gentleman, and in every respect the\r\nnoblest man, white or black, whom we met in the West Indies. He is\r\nhighly intelligent and of fine moral feelings. His manners are free\r\nand unassuming, and his language in conversation fluent and well\r\nchosen.... He is at the head of the special magistrates (of whom there\r\nare sixty (_sic_) in this island) and all the correspondence between\r\nthem and the governor is carried on through him. The station he holds\r\nis a very important one, and the business connected with it is of a\r\ncharacter and extent that, were he not a man of superior abilities, he\r\ncould not sustain. He is highly respected by the government in the\r\nisland and at home, and possesses the esteem of his fellow citizens of\r\nall colors. He associates with persons of the highest rank, dining and\r\nattending parties at the government house with all the aristocracy of\r\nJamaica. We had the pleasure of spending an evening with him at the\r\nsolicitor general's. Though an African sun has burnt a deep tinge on\r\nhim he is truly one of nature's nobleman. His demeanor is such, so\r\ndignified, yet so bland and amiable, that no one can help respecting\r\nhim.\"[7]\r\n\r\nHill represented St. James and afterwards Trelawny in the House of\r\nAssembly which sat from October 24, 1837, to November 3, 1838, and\r\nduring that time he served on several important committees, notably\r\none appointed to inquire into the state of the several courts of\r\njustice in the island. But the fact that he unsuccessfully contested\r\nthe representation of Port Royal in November, 1838, may have had\r\nsomething to do with his withdrawal from political strife. About 1840\r\nhe was offered the governorship of St. Lucia, but his love for his\r\nnative island caused him to decline the offer. He was in 1855\r\nnominated a member of the Privy Council which post he held only about\r\nten years.\r\n\r\nHis political career was ended early in life, and the remainder of his\r\ndays were passed in retirement at Spanish-Town where he had taken up\r\nhis abode upon being appointed stipendiary magistrate. He occupied his\r\ntime with his daily official duties and literary work and seldom left\r\nhome except for change of air at the sea side, to visit some intimate\r\nfriend in Kingston, or perhaps to take the chair at some missionary\r\ngathering, or to join in the deliberations of a committee meeting. In\r\n1847 Hill acted as Agent General of Immigration, and in December of\r\nthat year he submitted an interesting report to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nWhen the cholera swept over the island in 1851 Hill turned his\r\nbotanical studies to good account. The saline treatment was then in\r\nhigh esteem; but by means of the bitter-bush, _Eupatorium nervosum_, a\r\nshrub not unlike the wild sage in appearance, which grows freely on\r\nwaste lands, he is said to have alleviated much suffering and saved\r\nmany lives.\r\n\r\nHe was Vice-President from 1844 to 1849 of the Jamaica Society for the\r\nencouragement of Agriculture and other Arts and Sciences, instituted\r\nin 1825. In 1849 this Society ceased to exist and in its stead sprang\r\nup the Colonial Literary and Heading Society, of which Hill was one of\r\nthe managing committee. He was one of the nominated members of the\r\nthen Board of Education. He was a member of the original council of\r\nthe Royal Agricultural Society of Jamaica, founded in 1843,\r\nVice-President as late as 1857 of the Royal Society of Arts of\r\nJamaica, established in 1854 as the Jamaica Society of Arts, and\r\nVice-President of the Royal Society of Arts and Agriculture, which was\r\nthe result of the amalgamation of these two societies in 1864. In 1861\r\nhe had undertaken to edit jointly with the Rev. James Watson, the\r\nSecretary, the _Transactions of the Royal Society of Arts_, to which\r\nhe contributed various notes. But in the first number of the\r\n_Transactions of the Incorporated Royal Society of Arts and\r\nAgriculture_ (1867) is the record of a vote of sympathy and regret at\r\nhis inability to attend through ill-health; and although he\r\ncontributed articles to the journal he was not able to be present at\r\nthe meetings. His leisure was devoted to scientific study, especially\r\nthe ornithology, ichthyology, and anthropology of the West Indies. He\r\nnever let a single opportunity pass by, if he could possibly help it,\r\nwithout trying to benefit his country with his ready pen, and he\r\nalways gave all the encouragement he could to those who seemed at all\r\nanxious to study any subject with which he was in the least\r\nacquainted. He read some twenty-five lectures in all at various times\r\non various subjects.\r\n\r\nOn the title page of his _Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica_, as well as\r\nin his preface, Gosse bears testimony to the assistance which Hill\r\nrendered to him. The appearance of Hill's name on the title page\r\n(\"Assisted by Richard Hill, Esq., Cor. M. Z. S. Lond., Mem. Counc.\r\nBoy. Soc. Agriculture of Jamaica\") was, Mr. Edmund Gosse tells us in\r\nhis memoir of his father, greatly against that modest gentleman's\r\nwish. He tells us also that the friendship for Hill was one of the\r\nwarmest and most intimate friendships of his father's life. The\r\npublication of this book was delayed by the fact that every sheet was\r\nsent to Spanish Town to be read by Hill.\r\n\r\nHill contributed to several scientific publications both in England\r\nand America and by this means became connected with some of the\r\nleading learned societies of the world. He was corresponding member of\r\nthe Zoological Society of London, of the Leeds Institute and of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, and he numbered amongst his correspondents\r\nDarwin and Poey. Darwin had written in September, 1856, to Gosse for\r\nfurther information with respect to the habits of pigeons and rabbits\r\nreferred to in his _Sojourn_, and it was at Gosse's suggestion that\r\nDarwin wrote to Hill. In a later letter, of April, 1857, he says: \"I\r\nowe to using your name a most kind and valuable correspondent in Mr.\r\nHill, of Spanish Town.\"\r\n\r\nThe cony of Jamaica, _Capromys brachyurus_, found commonly in his day,\r\nbut now becoming extinct, was named by Hill in Gosse's _Naturalist's\r\nSojourn_; as well as four birds--three in the _Birds of Jamaica_ and\r\none in the _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_, and two fishes.\r\nOne bird (_Mimus hillii_), two fishes and four mollusca, three being\r\nJamaican, were named after Hill.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his collaboration with Gosse of the _Birds of Jamaica_\r\nand the _Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica_, Hill's best-known literary\r\nproductions are _A Week at Port Royal_, published at Montego Bay in\r\n1858; _Lights and Shadows of Jamaica History_, published in Kingston\r\nin 1859; _Eight Chapters in the History of Jamaica, 1508-1680_,\r\nillustrating the settlement of the Jews in the island which appeared\r\nin 1868; and _The Picaroons of One Hundred and Fifty Years Ago_, which\r\nwas published in Dublin in 1869.\r\n\r\nHe contributed, moreover, a large number of articles on natural\r\nhistory subjects to various Jamaica publications too numerous to\r\nmention. Some of these were: _The Jamaica Almanacs_; _Transactions of\r\nthe Jamaica Society of Arts_; _Transactions of the Royal Society of\r\nArts of Jamaica_; _The Jamaica Physical Journal_; _Jamaica Monthly\r\nMagazine_; _Jamaica Quarterly Magazine_. In England he contributed to\r\nthe _Proceedings of the Zoological Society_; and in America to the\r\n_Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Science_, Philadelphia, and the\r\n_Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History_, New York.\r\n\r\nIn stature he was tall and commanding, though perhaps the comparison\r\nof him to Antinous made by the writer of an obituary notice was a\r\nlittle exaggerated. All who knew bore testimony to his generosity,\r\nphilanthropy, modesty, even temper, and unfailing self-forgetfulness,\r\nhis kindness of heart, his piety, and his catholicism in matters of\r\nreligion. A portrait of him executed in oils, it is said, by James\r\nWyeth, an American artist who spent a short season in the island, is\r\nin the Jamaica History Gallery at the Institute of Jamaica, which also\r\npossesses a pencil sketch of him done by himself.\r\n\r\nFor two or three years before his death Hill suffered from failing\r\neyesight. He died, unmarried, at Spanish Town, on September 28, 1872,\r\nat the advanced age of seventy-eight. His remains were followed to the\r\ngrave by an immense concourse of all classes.\r\n\r\n                                             FRANK CUNDALL,\r\n                              _Secretary, The Institute of Jamaica_\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Taken in great measure from the biographical notice by the writer\r\nin the _Journal of the Institute of Jamaica_, July, 1896.\r\n\r\n[2] For a general sketch of this period see W. J. Gardner's _a History\r\nof Jamaica_, pp. 211-317.\r\n\r\n[3] This movement had for years been promoted by the heroic few. It\r\nwas then getting a hearing in Parliament. They first advocated the\r\nabolition of the slave trade and then directed attention to slavery.\r\n\r\n[4] These contributions closely connected Hill with the men whose new\r\nthought revolutionized science a few decades later.\r\n\r\n[5] San Domingo was then independent and the success of the free\r\nNegroes there would have a direct bearing on the anti-slavery\r\nmovement, as indifferent white men sometimes contended that the free\r\nNegro was a failure.\r\n\r\n[6] Slavery in the British West Indies was not actually abolished\r\ninstantly. Gradual emancipation was the method tried in most parts and\r\neven in cases of immediate emancipation the system of apprenticeship\r\nwhich followed was not much better than slavery.\r\n\r\n[7] The office of Secretary to the Stipendiary Magistrates was\r\nestablished in order to assist Governor Sligo to get through the\r\nenormous amount of correspondence entailed by the complaints sent to\r\nhim in connection with the administration of the laws with regard to\r\nthe apprenticeship system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELATIONS OF NEGROES AND INDIANS IN MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the longest unwritten chapters of the history of the United\r\nStates is that treating of the relations of the Negroes and Indians.\r\nThe Indians were already here when the white men came and the Negroes\r\nbrought in soon after to serve as a subject race found among the\r\nIndians one of their means of escape. That a larger number of the\r\nNegroes did not take refuge among the Indians was due to the ignorance\r\nof the blacks as to the geographic situation. Not knowing anything\r\nabout the country and unacquainted with the language of the white man\r\nor that of the Indians, most Negroes dared not venture very far from\r\nthe plantations on which they lived. Statistics show, however, that in\r\nspite of this impediment to the escape of Negroes to Indian\r\ncommunities, a considerable number of blacks availed themselves of\r\nthis opportunity. From the most northern colonies as far south as\r\nFlorida there was much contact resulting in the interbreeding of\r\nIndians and Negroes.\r\n\r\nIn no case was this better exemplified than in Massachusetts. Because\r\nof the cosmopolitan influences in that State where the fur trade,\r\nfisheries, and commerce brought the people into contact with a large\r\nnumber of foreigners, the Indian settlements by an infusion of blood\r\nfrom without served as a sort of melting pot in which the Negroes\r\nbecame an important factor. There was extensive miscegenation of the\r\ntwo races after the middle of the seventeenth century. In the course\r\nof ten or twelve generations there was an opportunity for \"foreign\r\nblood early introduced to permeate the whole mass and when it is\r\nconsidered that the intermixture was constantly kept up from the\r\noutside, it is a wonder that Indians of pure native race\r\nremained.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAccording to the first authentic census of Massachusetts, published in\r\n1765, all of the counties of the State except Hampshire, Hampden, and\r\nFranklin had both a Negro and Indian population. Barnstable had 231\r\nNegroes and 515 Indians; Berkshire had 88 Negroes and 221 Indians;\r\nBristol, 287 Negroes and 106 Indians; Dukes, 46 Negroes and 313\r\nIndians; Essex, 1070 Negroes and 8 Indians; Middlesex, 860 Negroes and\r\n45 Indians; Nantucket, 44 Negroes and 227 Indians; Suffolk, 844\r\nNegroes and 37 Indians; Worcester, 267 Negroes and 34 Indians, making\r\na total of 4900 Negroes and 1697 Indians.[2] After a careful survey of\r\nthe Indian situation in 1861, however, it was discovered that only a\r\npart of these Indians had retained their peculiar characteristics and\r\nthese had been finally reduced to a few reservations known as the\r\nfollowing: Chappequiddick, Christiantown, Gay Head, Marshpee, Herring\r\nPond, Natick, Punkapog, Fall River, Hassanamisco, and Dudley. There\r\nwere other Indians at Yarmouth, Dartmouth, Tumpum, Deep Bottom,\r\nMiddleborough, and a few scattered.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Indians were generally neglected for the reason that they were\r\nconsidered beyond the pale of Christianity, despite professions to the\r\ncontrary. As a matter of fact, being wards of the State they were\r\nscantily provided for and their fundamental needs were generally\r\nneglected. They were offered few opportunities for mental, moral, or\r\nreligious improvement for the reason that the missionary spirit which\r\ncharacterized Cotton Mather and John Eliot no longer existed. Only a\r\nsmall sum was raised or appropriated for their rudimentary education\r\nand with the exception of what could be done with the \"Williams Fund\"\r\nof Harvard College there was little effort made for their\r\nevangelization. Left thus to themselves, the Indians developed into a\r\nstate within a state.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the Negroes became conscious of the wrongs they\r\nsuffered in slavery, a few early learned to take refuge among the\r\nIndians and even after they were freed in Massachusetts their social\r\nproscription was such among the whites that some free people of color\r\npreferred the hard life among the Indians to the whiffs and scorns of\r\nrace prejudice in the seats of Christian civilization. Coming into\r\ncontact there with foreigners, who found it convenient to move among\r\nthese morally weak people, the Negroes served as important factors in\r\nthe melting pot in which the Indians were remade and introduced to\r\nAmerican life as whites and blacks. Referring to the moral condition\r\nof the Fall River Indians, as a case in evidence, an investigator\r\nreported in 1861 that in two families there were twelve cases of\r\nbastardy and in one of them it was said that, of eight children, the\r\npaternity was apparently about equally divided among the Indian,\r\nNegro, and white races.[4]\r\n\r\nThe reports on the state of the Indians always disclosed the presence\r\nand the influence of Negroes among them. \"Of the publishments of\r\ncolored persons interested and the early records of Dartmouth,\" said\r\nJ. M. Earle in 1861, \"by far the larger proportion of those of them\r\nwere Negro men to Indian women. In Yarmouth a large portion of those\r\nof Indian descent have intermarried with whites until their progeny\r\nhas become white, their social relations are with those of that color\r\nand they are mingled with the general community having lost their\r\nidentity as a distinct portion of the Hassanamiscoes and it would have\r\nbeen a fortunate thing for all if it had been so with them all. But\r\nthe mixture in most of the tribes has been more with the Negro race\r\nthan with the white until that blood probably predominates though\r\nthere are still a considerable number who have the prominent\r\ncharacteristics of the Indians--the lank, glossy, black hair, the\r\nhigh cheek bones--the bright dark eye and other features peculiar to\r\nthe race.\"[5]\r\n\r\nInvestigating the Indians of Gay Head in 1861, John M. Earle observed\r\nthat the people of Gay Head, like those of other plantations, were a\r\nmixture of the red, white and black races. They had also \"an infusion\r\nof the blood of the chivalry of the South as well as of the Portuguese\r\nand Dutch, as might be inferred from the names of Randolph, Madison,\r\nCorsa, Sylvia and Vanderhoop being found among them.\"[6] The admixture\r\nwas much like that on the other plantations with perhaps a less\r\ninfusion of the African than in some of them. A few were so strongly\r\nmarked with Indian characteristics as to lead one to conclude that\r\nthey are very nearly of pure blood, but there were none so nearly\r\nwhite as in some of the other tribes.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that these people had lived without the law, so to speak,\r\nin Massachusetts because of their refusal to accept certain\r\nregulations which the State desired to impose upon them. By the act of\r\nJune 25, 1811, the governor was authorized to appoint three persons to\r\nbe guardians of the Indian, Mulatto and Negro proprietors of Gay Head,\r\nwhich guardians, in addition to the usual powers given to\r\nfunctionaries in such cases, were empowered to take into their\r\npossession the lands of Indians, and allot to the several Indians such\r\npart of the lands as should be sufficient for their improvement from\r\ntime to time. The act further provided for the discontinuance or\r\nremoval of the guardians at the discretion of the governor and\r\ncouncil.[7] Under this act three guardians were appointed and in 1814\r\nthe Indians became dissatisfied with their guardians, who resigned,\r\nand the guardianship disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 there was enacted another measure providing that whenever the\r\nIndians and people of color at Gay Head should by a vote in town\r\nmeeting accept that act and should transmit to the governor an\r\nattested copy of the vote, the governor might then authorize the\r\nguardian to take up his duties at Gay Head, and might upon their\r\nrequest, appoint suitable persons to divide their lands. As the\r\nIndians had unpleasant recollections of the guardian-system, they\r\nnever accepted that proposal. For about thirty years they were without\r\nany guardians, and their affairs, except that of the public schools,\r\nwere left to themselves.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that the mere provision for the appointment of a\r\nguardian was not the only objectionable feature of the Act of 1828.\r\nThe guardian was given power to \"punish, by fine not exceeding twenty\r\ndollars, or by solitary imprisonment not exceeding twenty days, any\r\ntrespasses, batteries, larcenies under five dollars, gross lewdness\r\nand lascivious behavior, disorderly and riotous conduct, and for the\r\nsale of spirituous liquors within the territory, or on the lands of\r\nthese Indians and people of color.[8] The guardian or other justice of\r\nthe peace might issue his warrant directed to the constable of the\r\nIndians and people of color, or other proper officer, to arrest and\r\nbring before him, any offender against the provisions of this act; and\r\nafter judgment, he might order execution to be done by said constable\r\nor other proper officer; and if the guardian or other justice of the\r\npeace should adjudge any offender to solitary imprisonment, such\r\noffender should not, during the term of said imprisonment be visited\r\nby, or allowed to speak with any person other than the jailer, or the\r\nguardian or justice of the peace or such other person as the guardian\r\nor justice of the peace should specially authorize thereto; nor should\r\nsuch offender be allowed any food or drink other than coarse bread and\r\nwater, unless sickness should, in the opinion of a physician, render\r\nother sustenance necessary,\"[9] \"With such a provision in the Act,\"\r\nsaid J. M. Earle, \"making a discrimination so odious and unjust,\r\nbetween themselves and other prisoners, the Indians would have been\r\ngreatly wanting in self-respect had they accepted it. It is a\r\nprovision disgraceful to the statute book of the State, and\r\ndiscreditable to the civilization of the age. Yet two tribes, the\r\nChappequiddick and the Christiantown, were made subject to the\r\nprovisions of this law, without the power to accept or reject it, and\r\nare governed by it to this day\"[10] (1861).\r\n\r\nThe Marshpee tribe doubtless had a larger infusion of Negro blood than\r\nany. When the population of this tribe was 327 in 1771, 14 of them\r\nwere Negroes, married to Indians. In 1832 there were 315 inhabitants,\r\nof whom 16 were Negroes. According to the report of the Indian\r\ncommissioner in 1849 the population was 305 in 1848, of whom 26 were\r\nforeigners, all Negroes or mulattoes. The tribe numbered 403 in 1859,\r\n\"including 32 foreigners, married to natives of the tribe, all Negroes\r\nor mulattoes, or various mixtures of Negro, Indian, or white\r\nblood--none of them being pure whites.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe Punkapog Tribe of Indians formerly dwelt on a tract of land in\r\nCanton, Norfolk County, containing five thousand acres, granted them\r\nby the General Court of Massachusetts. Before 1861, however, they had\r\nlost all of this property, the last of it being sold by the guardian,\r\nabout 1841, in pursuance of a resolve of the legislature. \"The\r\nfull-blood Indians of the tribe,\" says the report of 1861, \"are all\r\nextinct. Their descendants, who, like those of all the other tribes in\r\nthe States, are of various grades of mixtures, of Indian, white, and\r\nNegro blood, number, so far as is ascertained one hundred and\r\nseventeen persons.\"[12]\r\n\r\nAccording to the survey made in 1861 the moral condition of the\r\nIndians was rather low and it was a regret that the people of color\r\nexhibiting generally more moral stamina should be degraded by living\r\namong them. Accounting for this condition of Affairs a contemporary\r\nsaid of the low moral condition of the Fall River Indians in 1861:\r\n\"The prejudice of color and caste, and the social proscription to\r\nwhich the colored people are subjected, has a twofold unfavorable\r\neffect upon them; first to detract from their self-respect and so to\r\nweaken the moral instincts, and then to throw them into the\r\nassociation of the more dissolute and degraded of other races, where\r\nthey fall an easy prey to immoral habits. There are, however, in this\r\ntribe as well as the others, instances of those who rise above all the\r\nevil influences with which they are encompassed and maintain a good\r\nstanding, as worthy and respectable members of the community. It would\r\nbe a cause for gratification, if it could be said truly that these are\r\nincreasing, or that there was any decided progress in the general\r\ncharacter of the tribe. But, from all the evidence that can be\r\ngathered, it does not appear that, for the last twelve or fourteen\r\nyears, there has been much, if any improvement in their moral and\r\nsocial condition,\"[13]\r\n\r\nThe situation in the Hassanamisco Tribe shows how the Indians in some\r\nof these reservations became extinct. Interbreeding with both races\r\nthey passed either to the blacks or to the whites. \"But little trace\r\nof Indian descent is apparent in the members of this tribe,\" said J.\r\nM. Earle in 1861. \"It is most marked in the few who have mixed chiefly\r\nwith the whites, yet some of these have no perceptible indications of\r\nit, and have become identified with the white race. The remainder of\r\nthe tribe have the distinguishing marks of African descent and mixed\r\nAfrican and white, of various grades, from the light quadroon and\r\nmulatto, to the apparently nearly pure negro, and, in every successive\r\ngeneration the slight remaining characteristics of the race become\r\nless apparent.\"[14]\r\n\r\nReferring to the Yarmouth Indians the investigator informs us that\r\nthese had tended to go almost altogether over to the white race. \"With\r\nthis exception,\" said he, \"nearly all of his descendants have\r\nintermarried with whites, down to the present day, so that they are\r\nsubstantially merged in the general community, having their social\r\nrelations with white people, with the exception of one or two\r\nfamilies.\"[15] It was observed that in all the families, in which both\r\nheads are living, there were only two in which one of them was not\r\npure white, and those having the Indian blood were usually so little\r\ncolored, that it would hardly be noticed by one not acquainted with\r\nthe fact. Some of them had but one sixteenth part of Indian blood. Of\r\nthe two widows found there in 1861 one was the wife of a white man.\r\nThe other was a Marshpee Indian whose husband belonged to the Yarmouth\r\ntribe and she associated with the people of color.\r\n\r\nDiscussing the Middleborough Indians, the same report said: \"They have\r\nbeen, for some time, commingled with them in the same community,\r\ngenerally under as favorable circumstances, in most respects, as the\r\nother colored population of the State, to which they assimilate and\r\nhave not been subjected to the peculiar present disadvantages under\r\nwhich those labor who are residents of the plantations,\"[16]\r\n\r\nBecause of numerous complaints to the effect that the unnecessary\r\nrestrictions placed on Indians no longer dependents worked a hardship,\r\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts enacted in 1861 a measure providing\r\nthat all Indians and descendants of Indians in that State should be\r\nplaced on the same legal footing as other inhabitants of that\r\nCommonwealth, excepting those who were supported or had been, in whole\r\nor in part, by the State and excepting also those residing on the\r\nIndian plantations of Chappequiddick, Christiantown, Gay Head,\r\nMarshpee, Herring Pond, Fall River and Dudley tribes or those whose\r\nhomes were thereon and were only temporarily absent. It further\r\nprovided that any Indian or person of color, thus denied the right of\r\ncitizenship but desirous of exercising that privilege might certify\r\nthe same in writing to the clerk of his town or city, who should make\r\na record of the same and upon the payment of a poll tax should become\r\nto all intents and purposes a citizen of the State, but such persons\r\nshould not return to the legal condition of an Indian. Indians unable\r\nto avail themselves of this opportunity remained under a guardian in\r\ntheir former state but by complying with this provision they finally\r\nemerged from their tribal state into the large body of citizens.\r\n\r\nGiving further consideration to the situation among the Indians, the\r\nlegislature of Massachusetts passed in 1869 what is known as _An Act\r\nto Enfranchise the Indians of the Commonwealth_. By this measure\r\npractically all Indians in that State were made citizens entitled to\r\nall the rights, privileges, and immunities and subject to all the\r\nduties and liabilities to which other citizens were entitled or\r\nsubject. The same provision was made in the acts of 1884, 1890, 1892\r\nand 1893.[17] With a proviso exempting from attachment or seizure on\r\nexecution for a debt or liability existing before the passage of the\r\nlaw this measure further declared all Indian lands \"rightfully held by\r\nany Indian in severalty and all such lands which had been or may be\r\nset off to any Indian should be and become the property of such person\r\nand his heirs in fee simple.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe Indians thereby became vested not only with the rights of any\r\nother citizen to sell or control his interest in property whether\r\nlegal or equitable but were given similar rights in the common lands\r\nwhich were transferable. Prior to this legislation the common lands\r\nhad been exploited by the State for the benefit of those Indians\r\nhaving the status of wards. Recognizing only equitable rights of\r\nownership in the Indians, the commonwealth kept their property under\r\npublic guardianship to protect them from the consequences of their\r\nown improvidence. Indians had the right immediately to have their\r\nshare of the common lands of the tribe transferred to them or sold for\r\ntheir special benefit. They were granted also the right to have their\r\nshare in any funds or other property held in trust for the tribe\r\nturned over to them.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Marshpee and Gay Head settlements, however, were\r\nmade exceptions in this case for the reason that the improvement in\r\ntheir condition was not adequate to justify the extension to them of\r\nthe same treatment given others; but they were given these same rights\r\nin 1870.[19] By the Act of 1870 the district of Marshpee was abolished\r\nas such and incorporated as a town by that name. To establish the\r\nclaim to the rights and privileges guaranteed other Indians in the Act\r\nof 1869, the Superior Court of the State was given jurisdiction and a\r\nboard of Selectmen was constituted as the authority for making such\r\napplications instead of any member of a tribe.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that this legislation of 1869 and 1870 solved the\r\nproblem of the wardship of Indians and free persons of color on the\r\nreservations. It developed thereafter, however, that all members of\r\nthese communities were not in a position to maintain themselves. In\r\n1902, therefore, it was enacted that the State Board of Charity upon\r\nthe application of the overseers of the poor of any town should make\r\nprovision in the State hospital or elsewhere for the support of\r\nIndians who may be unable to support themselves and have not acquired\r\na settlement in any town. Upon the application of an Indian who\r\nreceived aid from the commonwealth prior to the twenty-third day of\r\nJuly in the year 1869, the State Board was obligated to furnish him\r\nin the State hospital or elsewhere such aid as it might consider\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nThe provisions in the law of 1870 for the sale of certain lands in the\r\nproceeds of which these persons would share led to further action. In\r\n1870 the probate court appointed commissioners to make partition of\r\nthe common lands of the Marshpee Indians referred to in the Act of\r\n1869. These commissioners did not make their report until 1878. In\r\n1870 there was presented to the Superior Court by the Selectmen of\r\nMarshpee a petition for the division of common lands among the persons\r\nentitled thereto. In spite of argument to the contrary the Supreme\r\nCourt of Massachusetts held that the members of the Indian tribes\r\nmentioned in the Act of 1869 acquired both legal and equitable rights\r\nin tenants in common of the undivided lands of the tribe which were\r\ntransferable. It was provided in 1878 that the proceeds from the sale\r\nof such lands should be divided among the persons entitled to the land\r\nin proportion to their interests.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the Gay Head district also was abolished and incorporated as a\r\ntown. The Indians were guaranteed the same rights to lands in\r\nseveralty and the division of common lands as in the case of other\r\nIndian communities thus disestablished. The partition of these lands\r\nwas to be made in the Probate Court on application of the Selectmen or\r\nten resident owners of such land. An Indian feeling aggrieved because\r\nof an invasion of his rights could appeal his case, according to the\r\nprovision set forth in chapter 117 of the General Statutes of\r\nMassachusetts.[20]\r\n\r\nSome of these Negroes from the very beginning of their association\r\nwith the Indians took high rank.[21] The most prominent Negro of all,\r\nhowever, to come out of the Indian plantations was the celebrated Paul\r\nCuffe, well known in this country and Europe by his efforts in behalf\r\nof African colonization. He was a native of the tribe of Dartmouth\r\nIndians, of mixed African and white descent. His important achievement\r\nwas that of exploring the western coast of Africa with ships which he\r\nowned and fitted out and commanded and which he used in the\r\ntransportation of Negroes to Africa where he was the first to\r\nundertake the deportation of freedmen from the United States,\r\npreparing the way for the organization of the American Colonization\r\nSociety. On one of his voyages he visited England where he was\r\nreceived with marked attention by the nobility and the royalty itself.\r\nMen who knew Cuffe considered him a man of great character and\r\nrespected him because of his being able by dint of energy to\r\naccumulate sufficient property to place himself in circumstances of\r\npecuniary independence. Some of his descendants remained in the\r\nvicinity of the original Dartmouth Indians but others moved to\r\nCalifornia.[22]\r\n\r\nSeveral families of Negroes in Massachusetts trace their ancestry back\r\nto these Indians. According to the Attorney General of Massachusetts,\r\nthere are no special records kept at present of Negroes or persons of\r\ncolor who had interbreeded with Indians as regards the receipts by\r\nthem of pensions from the commonwealth given as the result of having\r\nbeen dispossessed of their lands. Some persons of color assert,\r\nhowever, that they are the direct descendants of King Philip and\r\nMassasoit. Because of this close connection with the Indians it was\r\nnecessary for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on dispossessing the\r\nIndians of their lands to give these persons of color the benefits of\r\nthe acts securing remuneration to the Indians. As these lands were\r\ndisposed of regardless of the rights of the Indians, the State has\r\nassumed the obligation of satisfying these claims by pensioning the\r\ncomplainants.\r\n\r\nMr. William George Butler, of West Medford, Massachusetts, a man now\r\nsixty years of age, receives such a pension. Mr. Butler's father came\r\nto Boston from Baltimore about 1815 and married a woman of color with\r\nan infusion of Indian blood. In looking up her estate this connection\r\nwas discovered and a petition was sent to the Massachusetts\r\nLegislature in her favor. Upon the investigation of her claim, which\r\nproved to be just, she was granted a pension of $250 a year, which\r\nButler inherited.[23] In the following list of persons and tribes from\r\nwhich are descended all Indians who are at present receiving pensions\r\nfrom the Commonwealth, of Massachusetts, however, appear several\r\nNegroes or persons of color.[24] These are:\r\n\r\n  Lemuel D. and Anna Burr      Ponkapoag\r\n  Fannie S.

All Indians and descendants of Indians in this State are\r\n     hereby placed on the same legal footing as the other inhabitants\r\n     of the Commonwealth, excepting those who are supported, or have\r\n     been, in whole or in part, by the State, and excepting also,\r\n     those residing on the Indian plantations of the Chappequiddick,\r\n     Christiantown, Gay Head, Marshpee, Herring Pond, Fall River, and\r\n     Dudley tribes, or those whose homes are thereon and are only\r\n     temporarily absent.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 2. Any Indian or person of color, belonging to either of\r\n     the tribes before mentioned, and residing within the limits of\r\n     any town or city of this Commonwealth, to whom the right of\r\n     citizenship is not extended by the first section of this act but\r\n     who wishes to exercise that privilege, may certify the same in\r\n     writing to the clerk of the town or city where he resides, who\r\n     shall make record of the same: and upon paying a poll tax, he\r\n     shall become, to all intents and purposes, a citizen of the\r\n     State, and shall not, thenceforward, return to the legal\r\n     condition of an Indian. And settlement shall be required, by\r\n     those who become citizens, under the provisions of this act, in\r\n     the same manner they are acquired by other persons, under the\r\n     General Statutes of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 3. It shall be the duty of the governor, by and with the\r\n     advice and consent of the council, to appoint an able, discreet,\r\n     and suitable person, to be Indian commissioner, who shall hold\r\n     his office for the term of three years, unless sooner removed by\r\n     the governor and council. And the governor and council shall fill\r\n     all vacancies which shall happen in said office, by death,\r\n     resignation, expiration of said term, or otherwise. It shall be\r\n     the duty of said commissioner to exercise a careful supervision\r\n     over the affairs of all the Indians of the Commonwealth, not\r\n     endowed by the provisions of this act, with the rights of\r\n     citizenship, and to aid them, by advice, counsel, and whatever\r\n     other suitable means may be within his control, to promote their\r\n     welfare, to improve their general condition, and to qualify\r\n     themselves, judiciously, and with safety to themselves and\r\n     others, to be placed, at as early a time as may be, on the same\r\n     legal footing as the other inhabitants of the Commonwealth. He\r\n     shall exercise all the powers, perform all the duties, and be\r\n     subject to all the restrictions, responsibilities and\r\n     liabilities, which now by law appertain to the treasurer of\r\n     Marshpee, and to the guardians of other tribes except so far as\r\n     they may be charged or varied by the provisions of this act; and\r\n     he shall give bonds, to the satisfaction of the governor and\r\n     council, for the faithful performance of such trust.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 4. The said commissioner shall, as soon as is convenient,\r\n     after his appointment, cause a registration to be made, on the\r\n     basis of the general registration of the State, of all the\r\n     members of the several tribes, specifying the parentage and date\r\n     of the birth of each, as near as can be ascertained, and the date\r\n     of all marriages of parties now living, with all the particulars,\r\n     that are now required of town clerks, by the laws of the State,\r\n     and having completed the same, up to the time required by law for\r\n     the last preceding return to be made, he shall, thenceforward\r\n     make and keep a true registration of all the births, marriages,\r\n     and deaths, in each of the said tribes, and shall annually make\r\n     due return thereof, the whole to be done in the same manner as is\r\n     required of town clerks, and under the same liabilities and\r\n     conditions that are, by law, imposed upon them.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 5. The said commissioner shall, in concurrence with the\r\n     proper officers of the Gay Head tribe, cause a survey of all the\r\n     land held in severalty, by the members of said tribe, setting out\r\n     the same to each, by betes and bounds, and, when the survey is\r\n     complete, shall cause a record of the portion of each proprietor\r\n     to be made in the registry of deeds, of the county of Dukes\r\n     County, and thereupon, the legal title shall vest in the several\r\n     proprietors thereof, their heirs, and assigns, forever:\r\n     _provided, however_, that no land on the plantation shall ever be\r\n     alienated from the tribe or be held or possessed by any person\r\n     who is not a member thereof; and when ever the family of any\r\n     proprietor becomes extinct, the real estate of said proprietor\r\n     shall revert to said tribe and become the property thereof, in\r\n     common. And whenever, hereafter, any common land shall be taken\r\n     up to be occupied and possessed in severalty, by any member of\r\n     the tribe, having the concurrence of the tribe therein, the same\r\n     shall be surveyed, set forth, and recorded, under the supervision\r\n     of said commissioner, as is above provided; and no title to any\r\n     common land, to be held in severalty, on said plantation shall be\r\n     acquired in any other manner.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 6. The said commission shall cause a survey to be made of\r\n     the Indian plantation at Fall River and the bounds thereof to be\r\n     renewed, agreeably to the surveys made by order of the State in\r\n     one thousand seven hundred and sixty-three. He shall ascertain to\r\n     whom the several lots belong by hereditary descent from the\r\n     proprietors to whom they belonged in one thousand seven hundred\r\n     and sixty-four, so far as descendants of said proprietors still\r\n     remain, and shall designate the same by the numbers of the lots\r\n     respectively; and in the same manner, he shall designate the\r\n     several lots, if such there be, of which the families of the\r\n     former proprietors have become extinct, and shall make return of\r\n     the same to the governor and council, for the use of the\r\n     legislature, and shall report such other facts connected\r\n     therewith as may be useful to them, and shall recommend such\r\n     disposition of the land remaining in common, as in his judgment,\r\n     shall be most conducive to the welfare of the Indians, and of the\r\n     State.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 7. The said commissioner shall, as soon as the performance\r\n     of the duties of his office shall have made him sufficiently\r\n     acquainted with the necessities and wants of the Indians, and\r\n     with the other facts necessary to qualify him for the service,\r\n     prepare a bill embodying a system for governing, managing, and\r\n     regulating the affairs of the several tribes, as nearly uniform\r\n     in its provision respecting them severally, as the circumstances\r\n     of the different tribes will permit, as a substitute for the\r\n     present laws on that subject, and report the same to the governor\r\n     and council for the consideration of the legislature, accompanied\r\n     by the reasons on which the several provisions therein\r\n     recommended are sustained.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 8. The Indians and people of color on Gay Head, and the\r\n     officers by them appointed for the purpose, shall have the same\r\n     powers in the management of their municipal affairs, and in\r\n     relation to the employment of teachers, and the making and\r\n     enforcing of all rules for the regulation and government of their\r\n     schools, that by law are exercised by the inhabitants and\r\n     corresponding officers of the several towns of the Commonwealth:\r\n     _provided, however_, that this shall not be construed to\r\n     authorize the alienation of any of the territory of the\r\n     plantation: and _provided, further_, that no person shall be\r\n     authorized to vote in municipal affairs, except natives of the\r\n     Gay Head tribe, natives of other Indian tribes of this State\r\n     married or having been married to a Gay Head woman and resident\r\n     on the plantation, or such other person resident on the\r\n     plantation and married or having been married to a Gay Head\r\n     woman, as shall have the right conferred on him by a vote of\r\n     two-thirds of the voters of the plantation.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 9. All acts and parts of acts heretofore passed, so far as\r\n     they conflict with the provisions of this act, are hereby\r\n     repealed.\r\n\r\n     Sect. 10. This act shall take effect from and after its passage.\r\n\r\n     If the legislature should decide not to authorize the appointment\r\n     of a single commissioner for the State, I would propose the\r\n     passage of the same Bill with the following amendments:--\r\n\r\n     Strike out the whole of section 3.\r\n\r\n     Strike out in section 4 the words \"said commissioner shall, as\r\n     soon as is convenient after his appointment,\" and insert the\r\n     words--clerks of Marshpee, the guardians of the several\r\n     plantation tribes, and the clerk of Gay Head shall.\r\n\r\n     In section 5, strike out the words \"said commissioner,\" and\r\n     insert the words--guardians of the Chappequiddick and\r\n     Christiantown tribes. Also, in the latter portion of the same\r\n     section, strike out the word \"commissioner\" and insert the\r\n     word--guardian.\r\n\r\n     In section 6, strike out the words \"said commissioner,\" and\r\n     insert the words--guardian of the Troy or Fall River tribe.\r\n\r\n     Strike out section 7, entire.\r\n\r\n     Alter the numbering of the sections after 2, to correspond to the\r\n     changes.\r\n\r\n     Insert the following section after section 8:--\r\n\r\n     Sect. --. No person shall be entitled to support by any tribe in\r\n     the State, of whose parents, one only was an Indian, and whose\r\n     residence was not on the plantation of the tribe at the time of\r\n     his birth, unless the rights of himself or parents as members of\r\n     the tribe, shall have been subsequently recognized by the tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME NEGRO MEMBERS OF RECONSTRUCTION CONVENTIONS AND LEGISLATURES AND\r\nOF CONGRESS[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo systematic effort has hitherto been made to save the records of the\r\nNegro during the Reconstruction period. American public opinion has\r\nbeen so prejudiced against the Negroes because of their elevation to\r\nprominence in southern politics that it has been considered sufficient\r\nto destroy their regime and forget it. As future historians will seek\r\nfor facts beyond those compiled by biased investigators now writing\r\nmonographs in this field, a few persons realizing the importance of\r\npreserving the records in which the actual facts are set forth, are\r\nnow directing the attention of the country to this neglected aspect of\r\nour history. These lists of suggestive names of the men who figured\r\nconspicuously in this recent drama will be decidedly useful in the\r\ncollection of facts adequate to the presentation of both sides of the\r\nquestion. These lists are far from being complete. This is but a step\r\nin the right direction and persons in possession of such facts are\r\nearnestly urged to cooeperate in collecting them.\r\n\r\nIt has been extremely difficult to determine the race of the members\r\nof the various Reconstruction bodies. The lists of members as\r\npublished in the Journals of the legislatures do not indicate the\r\nrace. This has to be determined by contemporary information. The\r\nmethods used by other persons and agencies in identifying the race\r\nhave been various. The Negro members of the North Carolina General\r\nAssembly, for example, were indicated by the figure 37 in the State\r\nManual listing all persons who had been in the Assembly. Where no such\r\ninformation could be obtained from printed matter, it has been\r\nnecessary to rely upon information obtained from individuals who\r\nparticipated in the Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGRO MEMBERS OF THE ALABAMA CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, 1867[2]\r\n\r\n  District           Name                       County\r\n  1st                John Carraway              Mobile\r\n                     Ovide Gregory              Mobile\r\n  6th                Thomas Diggs               Barbour\r\n  7th                B.

Alston was a member of the Alabama Legislature for Macon\r\nCounty, 1868 and 1869-79. He was a shoemaker by trade and had formerly\r\nbeen a slave. It was reported that before the war there was a Military\r\nCompany in the town of Tuskegee. The members of this company desired\r\nto have a drummer, and for this purpose they sent to South Carolina\r\nand bought James H. Alston. It was thought that he came from\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nHenry Young was a member of the Alabama Legislature about 1868 and\r\n1869-70. He was a slave who could read and write, having been taught\r\nby his master's children. He would, somewhat like Frederick Douglass,\r\nspell out the words on letters that he was called upon to deliver or\r\nto get from the post office, and in this way he also increased his\r\nability to read.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   CONWAY, ARK.,--October 14, 1916.\r\n\r\nNEGROES IN POLITICS IN ARKANSAS DURING RECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\nIn the constitutional convention of 1868, there were 8 Negro\r\ndelegates, that is, J. W. Mason, Richard Samuels, William Murphy,\r\nMonroe Hawkins, William Grey, James T. White, Henry Rector and Thomas\r\nP. Johnson. (_Proceedings of the Constitutional Convention of 1868_,\r\npages 2 to 5.)\r\n\r\nNegroes in the Arkansas Legislature: Session April 2 to July 23, 1869,\r\nand session November 17, 1868, to April 10, 1869, were seven Negro\r\nmembers of whom J. W. Mason, the leading Negro in the Senate; W. H.\r\nGrey, leading Negro in the House. (_Daily Republican_, Oct. 1, 1868).\r\n\r\nIn the Legislature of January 2 to March 25, 1871, there were eleven\r\nNegro members: J. W. Mason and J. T. White in the Senate: J. M.\r\nAlexander, Austin Barrow, Conway Barbour, John Webb, Adam Johnson,\r\nJeff Haskins, A. Mays, William Young, Carl Pope, A. J. Robinson, E. A.\r\nFulton in the House. (_Daily Republican_, March 25, 1871.)\r\n\r\nIn the 19th session, January 6 to April 25, 1873, the last session\r\nbefore Baxter called his special session, something less than one\r\nfifth of all the members were Negroes. I have been unable to ascertain\r\nthe exact number in this session, but from the standpoint of numbers,\r\nI would judge that there is no great difference between this session\r\nand the previous one. _The Arkansas Gazette_ of January 12, 1873, says\r\nof the Negro members: \"There are a few men among these colored members\r\nwho are bright and intelligent, and much superior to some white\r\nmembers, but as a rule, this is not the case.\"\r\n\r\n                              (Signed) THOMAS S.

He attended the\r\nInstitute For Colored Youth and then entered Lincoln University, where\r\nhe was graduated in 1873. He then taught school in South Carolina,\r\nMaryland and Florida. In addition to being a member of the Florida\r\nLegislature, 1881-83, he was clerk in the United States Land Office of\r\nFlorida. He was Inspector of Customs at Pensacola, and for fourteen\r\nyears held the position of Internal Revenue Collector at Tampa.\r\n\r\nH. W. Chandler was Senator, Marion County, 1880-1888. For sketch of\r\nearly life, see Simmons' _Men of Mark_. He was delegate to the\r\nNational Republican Convention 1884-1908. He was Inspector of Customs\r\nat Tampa from May 1908 to December 1913.\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Mays was marshal of Jacksonville. This was an elective\r\noffice. The position made him head of police force with appointive\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nJames Dean was County Judge, Monroe County in 1889, but served less\r\nthan one year. He was impeached for issuing license to a colored Cuban\r\nman to marry a white Cuban woman. This a custom in Cuba. Dean was\r\nimpeached on ground that he had issued license to Negro to marry a\r\nwhite woman. He was summarily removed without a hearing. This was said\r\nto have been a put-up job, as the man was secured to get a license.\r\nDean did not have a trial. The only way to get case reviewed was to\r\ninstitute quo warranto proceedings. To do this, it was necessary to\r\nget the permission of the State's Attorney General to use the State's\r\nname. He was not able to do this.\r\n\r\nMitchell Chappelle was Negro Mayor of LaVilla. Formerly these were two\r\nadjoining towns, Jacksonville and LaVilla. The two are now\r\nJacksonville.\r\n\r\nCharles Dupont was reported as being sheriff of Monroe County about 27\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Republicans went out of power in Florida.

MONROE N. WORK,\r\n  Editor--_The Negro Year Book_,\r\n    Tuskegee Institute, Ala.\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to your letter requesting my assistance in getting data\r\nrelative to the Reconstruction Period in South Carolina, I have the\r\nhonor to submit the following:\r\n\r\nIt will be utterly impossible to give dates after a lapse of nearly\r\nfifty years, especially with reference to the terms the legislators\r\nserved, unless I had access to the records. I was a boy when our\r\nfamily returned to South Carolina in 1870, two years after the\r\nadjournment of the Constitutional Convention. At that period I was not\r\nespecially interested in the trend of affairs. I was thinking more of\r\nthe splendid opportunities I had left behind in Canada.\r\n\r\nI think it very important that all of the data possible should be\r\ncollected pertaining to the Constitutional Convening as I regard it\r\nthe most important Convention ever held in which colored men\r\nparticipated. I was very fortunate in finding a copy of the\r\nProceedings of the Convention in the Public Library in this city. I\r\nhave given only such names as I could positively identify as colored.\r\nNo doubt some names have been omitted but not of any who took an\r\nactive or important part in political affairs.\r\n\r\nF. B. Perry, of Greenville, S.C., was appointed Provisional Governor\r\nof South Carolina by President Johnson in 1865.\r\n\r\nPursuant to a call for a convention of the people issued by Governor\r\nPerry in obedience to the proclamation of President Johnson for the\r\npurpose of organizing a State Government, the Convention assembled at\r\nColumbia, S.C., September 13, 1865.\r\n\r\nTo show the intense bitter feeling of Governor Perry the following is\r\nfrom his proclamation:\r\n\r\n\"It is a source of congratulation to know that the colored troops,\r\nwhose atrocious conduct has disgraced the service and filled the\r\npublic mind with the most horrible apprehensions, have been withdrawn\r\nfrom the interior of the State, and are to be placed in garrisons on\r\nthe coast where they can do no further mischief. In all of my personal\r\ninterviews with the President and in all of my dispatches to him I\r\nurged this course most earnestly.\"\r\n\r\nA Constitution was adopted by the Convention without being submitted\r\nto the people for ratification.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provided that only free white men were eligible for\r\nmembership in the Senate and House of Representatives; only free white\r\nmen were entitled to vote and that the appointment of members of the\r\nHouse of Representatives among the several election districts of the\r\nState should be in accordance with the number of white inhabitants in\r\neach.\r\n\r\nThe Convention adjourned September 27, 1865.\r\n\r\nCongress decided that it was no part of the prerogative of the\r\nExecutive to call conventions or to direct the adoption of\r\nConstitutions.\r\n\r\nJ. L. Orr, of Anderson, S. C., was elected Provisional Governor,\r\nOctober, 1865, to succeed Governor Perry.\r\n\r\nPersuant to an Act of Congress of the United States entitled \"An Act\r\nto provide for the More Efficient Government of the Rebel States\" an\r\nelection was held in South Carolina on November 19th and 20th, 1867,\r\nand the electors of that State voted in favor of a Constitutional\r\nConvention, and at the same time voted for delegates thereto.\r\n\r\nBrevet Major-General E. R. S. Canby, Commanding 2d Military District\r\nof South Carolina issued orders for the delegates to assemble in\r\nconvention at Charleston, S.C., January 14, 1868.\r\n\r\nThe Convention composed of 124 delegates, a large majority being\r\ncolored, met at Charleston, on the date named.\r\n\r\nT. J. Robertson, white, was elected temporary President and Dr. A. G.\r\nMackey, white, was elected permanent President.\r\n\r\nW. J. McKinlay and H. E. Hayne were elected temporary Secretary and\r\nAssistant Secretary, respectively.\r\n\r\nGeneral Carlos J. Stalbrand, white, was elected permanent Secretary.\r\nJosephus Woodruff, white, compiled the proceedings.\r\n\r\nJohn R. Pinckney and Peter Miller were elected Sergeants-at-Arms.\r\n\r\nF. L. Cardozo was Chairman of the Committee on Education.\r\n\r\nS. A. Swails, Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Regulations.\r\n\r\nRobert C. DeLarge, Chairman of the Committee on Franchise and\r\nElections.\r\n\r\nColored members were on all of the Committees, in most cases being in\r\nthe majority.\r\n\r\nIn looking over the proceedings I find that the following named\r\ndelegates took a very active part in all of the deliberations:\r\n\r\nR. B. Elliott, R. C. DeLarge, F. L. Cardozo, J. J. Wright, W. J.\r\nWhipper, W. J. McKinlay, S. A. Swails, A. J. Ransier, R. H. Cain, B.\r\nF. Randolph, and W. B. Nash.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provided for the election of Senators and\r\nRepresentatives on April 14, 15 and 16, 1868, to assemble at Columbia,\r\nMay 12, 1868.\r\n\r\nThe Convention adjourned sine die March 14, 1868.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution adopted in 1868 stood unchanged until 1895 when a\r\nConvention was called to meet at Columbia, on September 10, 1895, to\r\nrevise it.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the old Constitution stood for nineteen years after the\r\nDemocratic party came into power (1876) shows that there could not\r\nhave been anything objectionable in it to the Democrats or they would\r\nhave changed it immediately after regaining control. It speaks volumes\r\nfor the wisdom and foresight of the men of the Reconstruction Period.\r\n\r\nIn the Convention which met at Columbia in 1895, there were only five\r\ncolored delegates and they were all from Beaufort County, a county\r\nwhich has very few white persons in it. The delegates were W. J.\r\nWhipper, Robert Smalls, Thomas E. Miller, James Wigg, and L. R. Reed.\r\nOf these, W. J. Whipper and Robert Smalls were delegates to the\r\nConstitutional Convention which met at Charleston in 1868.\r\n\r\nAs General Smalls died only about two or three years ago what a wealth\r\nof information he could have furnished pertaining to the\r\nReconstruction Period had your request been sent out before his death.\r\n\r\nInclosure 2 contains the names of State Senators and the counties they\r\nrepresented. In several cases of Senators and also of Members of the\r\nHouse of Representatives I cannot recall their initials.\r\n\r\nThere were 32 senators, the majority being colored, of whom the\r\nfollowing were conspicuous for their activity on all important\r\nlegislation:\r\n\r\nS. A. Swails, J. H. Rainey, R. H. Cain, W. H. Jones, W. B. Nash and H.\r\nJ. Maxwell.\r\n\r\nInclosure 3 contains names of members of the House of Representatives\r\nat various times. Some served more than one term. The more prominent\r\nwere: R. B. Elliott, S.J. Lee, Dr. B.A. Bosemon, J. H. Rainey, R. C.\r\nDeLarge, J. A. Bowley, W. J. Whipper, D. A. Straker, C. M. Wilder,\r\nPrince Rivers, F. H. Frost, T. E. Miller, and W. H. Thomas.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives was composed of 124 members and colored\r\nmembers were always in the majority.\r\n\r\nInclosure 4--Names of State Officers.\r\n\r\nInclosure 5--Names of Federal Office holders.\r\n\r\nInclosure 6--Names of Congressmen who represented South Carolina.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the scene in 1876 when Col. A. C. Haskell,\r\nChairman of the Democratic State Committee at the head of the\r\nDemocratic members of the legislature forced his way into the Hall of\r\nthe Representatives then occupied by the Republican members.\r\nPandemonium reigned for a time. There were two Houses, each having its\r\nown officers trying to transact business at the same time. Finally the\r\nU. S. soldiers were called upon and those Democrats who had no\r\ncertificate of election were ejected.\r\n\r\nAll of the Democratic members then withdrew and formed an organization\r\nin another hall.\r\n\r\nThree colored Republicans whose names I do not care to mention went\r\nover to the Democrats, but the latter could do nothing without the\r\nSenate which was admittedly Republican.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was kept up until Mr. Hayes was inaugurated President,\r\nwhen he withdrew the U. S. troops, leaving the Republicans without any\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nGovernor Chamberlain and the State Officers elected with him seeing\r\nthat they were deserted by the National Administration withdrew from\r\nthe contest, leaving Gen. Hampton who was the Democratic nominee for\r\nGovernor in possession.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats then organized the Senate and House of Representatives,\r\nand in joint session elected Gen. M. C. Butler, U. S. Senator. D. T.\r\nCorbin, who received the Republican votes, contested, but the Senate\r\nwhich was Republican by a small majority seated Butler. Senators Don\r\nCameron from Pennsylvania and John J. Patterson from South Carolina,\r\nboth Republicans, voted for Butler.\r\n\r\nThat there was no one killed or injured while the contest was going on\r\nis remarkable when the great excitement during and after the \"Red\r\nShirt\" campaign is considered. It shows what absolute control the\r\ngubernational candidates had over their followers. No doubt the\r\nDemocrats, who were assured that the U. S. soldiers would be\r\nwithdrawn, did not care to make a slip as Chamberlin was still\r\ngovernor and the troops were practically under his orders.\r\n\r\nThus ended the Reconstruction Period in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt every step the Republican Party in South Carolina was betrayed by\r\nRepublicans.\r\n\r\nCol. T. W. Parmele, white. Superintendent of the Penitentiary,\r\nappointed as a Republican by Gov. Chamberlin, recognized an order from\r\nGen. Hampton for the pardon of a convict. Legal complications ensued\r\nand the case was carried before Associate Justice Willard, white, of\r\nthe Supreme Court, a Republican elected by the legislature, and he\r\ndecided in favor of Hampton.\r\n\r\nThree colored members of the legislature deserted to the Democrats,\r\nwhich practically made the House Democratic.\r\n\r\nCol. Parmele and Justice Willard were Northern white men.\r\n\r\nThis paper would not be complete without some reference to the\r\nprominent colored men who helped to make history during that eventful\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nRobert Brown Elliott--\r\n\r\n     Born at Boston, Mass., August 11, 1842.\r\n\r\n     Entered High Holborn Academy, London, England, 1853.\r\n\r\n     Entered Eton College, 1855 and graduated in 1859.

S. Senator in\r\n     1874, but the powerful influence of the Pennsylvania R. R. Co.,\r\n     was exerted in behalf of John J. Patterson, white, the successful\r\n     candidate. There was a colored majority in both branches of the\r\n     legislature at the time and had the colored members so desired\r\n     they could have elected Gen. Elliott.\r\n\r\n     In 1876 Gen. Elliott was the nominee on the Republican ticket for\r\n     Attorney General and was elected but was forced to withdraw with\r\n     the rest of the ticket.\r\n\r\n     He was Chairman of the State Republican Committee during the\r\n     campaign of 1876.\r\n\r\n     For scholarly attainments, legal acumen, political sagacity and\r\n     oratorical power, Robert Brown Elliott stands out as the most\r\n     brilliant figure of the Reconstruction Period.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph H. Rainey--\r\n\r\n     Born at Georgetown, S.C., June 21, 1832.\r\n\r\n     Although debarred by law from attending school he acquired a good\r\n     education and further improved his mind by observation and\r\n     travel.\r\n\r\n     He was a barber by trade and followed that occupation at\r\n     Charleston, S.C., until 1862, when having been forced to work\r\n     upon the fortifications of the Confederates he escaped to the\r\n     West Indies, where he remained until the close of the war, when\r\n     he returned to his native town.\r\n\r\n     Delegate to the State Constitutional Convention.\r\n\r\n     State Senator from Georgetown County.\r\n\r\n     Elected to the 41st Congress, being the first colored man having\r\n     that distinction, and was re-elected to the 42nd, 43rd, 44th and\r\n     45th Congresses, five successive terms, the only colored man with\r\n     such a record.\r\n\r\n     He received a caucus nomination as Clerk of the House, from the\r\n     Republican members of Congress, the only colored man who has ever\r\n     been honored by a Republican caucus.\r\n\r\n     The House was Democratic.\r\n\r\n     He was a delegate to several National Republican Conventions.\r\n\r\n     Served as Special Agent for the Treasury Department.\r\n\r\n     Polished in his manners--a fluent and convincing speaker, he was\r\n     prominent in the Councils of the Republican Party.\r\n\r\n\r\nGen.

C.\r\n\r\n     A man of ripe scholarship and of high legal attainments.\r\n\r\n     Until President Roosevelt appointed Judge R. H.

He also went to\r\n     other parts of the State equally as dangerous and filled his\r\n     engagements.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. J. Wright--\r\n\r\n     Delegate to the State Constitutional Convention.\r\n\r\n     On account of his great legal ability he was elected by the\r\n     legislature as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the\r\n     State. (There were two Associate Justices.) He had the respect of\r\n     the entire Bar of the State.\r\n\r\n     He was pre-eminently fitted for the position.\r\n\r\n     He is the only colored man who has ever occupied such an exalted\r\n     judicial position in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas E.

Appointed by\r\n     President Grant two terms and one term each by Presidents\r\n     Garfield and Hayes.\r\n\r\n     There were two white applicants for the position after President\r\n     Garfield was inaugurated and Postmaster General James, who was\r\n     supposed to be friendly with one of them, sent a Post Office\r\n     Inspector to Columbia to find out the sentiment of the business\r\n     men. They were almost unanimously for Mr. Wilder. They stated\r\n     that he had served them efficiently for eight years and did not\r\n     approve of a change.\r\n\r\n     Generals Hampton and Butler represented the State in the U. S.\r\n     Senate at the time, Columbia being Senator Hampton's home and had\r\n     he objected Senatorial courtesy would have sustained him.\r\n\r\n     It shows in what estimation Mr. Wilder was held by his home\r\n     people.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Wilder's appointment of four successive terms to a\r\n     first-class post office is a record.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Wilder was a delegate to all of the National Republican\r\n     Conventions up to and including that of 1888.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Wilder was a man of good sound judgment, of great political\r\n     force and one of the few who had anything to show after the\r\n     political upheaval of 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel J.

C. Jones--\r\n\r\n     Born in Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n     Clerk of the House of Representatives during the whole\r\n     Reconstruction Period.\r\n\r\n     A very capable officer and very popular.\r\n\r\n\r\nWalter R. Jones--\r\n\r\n     Born in South Carolina at Charleston.\r\n\r\n     Graduate of Oberlin College.\r\n\r\n     Secretary of the State Financial Board, consisting of the\r\n     Governor, Attorney General, State Treasurer and Comptroller, all\r\n     white at that time.\r\n\r\n     Elected Clerk of the City Council of Columbia, S. C., by the\r\n     unanimous vote of the members.\r\n\r\n     Resigned that position to accept the position of Private\r\n     Secretary to Governor Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n     The best equipped and most brilliant young colored man I ever\r\n     met.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. E. Green--\r\n\r\n     Sergeant at Arms of the Senate during the whole Reconstruction\r\n     Period.\r\n\r\n     A very efficient officer and a man of fine parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Williams--\r\n\r\n     Sergeant at Arms of the House of Representatives during the whole\r\n     period.\r\n\r\n     A very capable man and popular with the members.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were many colored men who occupied positions of importance in\r\nthe different countries--positions such as Sheriff, Treasurer,\r\nAuditor, Clerk of Court, Commissioner, Coroner and School\r\nCommissioner.\r\n\r\nI never heard of any of them being removed for incompetency,\r\ndereliction of duty or malfeasance.\r\n\r\n\r\nI regret very much that I cannot give you any information as to\r\nwhether the men mentioned were free or slaves, as the persons from\r\nwhom I could have gotten that information have all passed away. Had I\r\nreceived such inquiry eight or ten years ago I could have furnished it\r\nas there were several persons then living who, I know, were well\r\nposted on that subject.\r\n\r\nOf the names noted in this paper the following were from the North.\r\n\r\nSome of them may have been from the South originally and returned\r\nafter the war: R. B. Elliott, D. A. Straker, Maj. M. R. Delaney, W. H.\r\nJones, Dr. B. A. Bosemon, W. H. Thomas, H. W. Purvis, R. H. Gleaves,\r\nA. C. Jones, S. A. Swails, J. A. Bowley, J. E. Green.\r\n\r\nThe colored men of South Carolina played a more conspicuous part and\r\nheld more offices of a high grade during the Reconstruction Period\r\nthan the colored men of any other State.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has the distinction of electing the first colored\r\nCongressman, (Joseph H. Rainey) and the last (George W. Murray.)[27]\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina was represented in Congress by eight colored\r\nmen--Rainey, Elliott, Ransier, Cain, Delarge, Smalls, Miller and\r\nMurray.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller and Mr. Murray served after the Reconstruction Period and\r\nmost of Gen. Smalls' service was after that period.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I compare the present political leaders in South Carolina with\r\nthose of the Reconstruction Period I must confess that we have\r\nretrograted politically. They may be due to conditions. Not only in\r\nSouth Carolina, but where would you find in any State at the present\r\ntime, political leaders who can measure up to the caliber of Elliott,\r\nRainey, Straker, Cardozo, Swails, DeLarge, Bosemon, Wright, Ransier,\r\nLee, McKinlay, Cain, Whipper and Wilder?\r\n\r\nWhen the Negro race can again produce political leaders of the type\r\nnamed then we may look forward with some degree of hope for a solution\r\nof the Negro problem.\r\n\r\nYour idea in collecting data relative to the Reconstruction Period is\r\na laudable one, and the wonder is, and the pity of it is, that it had\r\nnot been thought of long ere this. There are very few now left to tell\r\nthe tale, and that in a very unsatisfactory way.\r\n\r\nSome of the data relative to the Congressmen I got from Congressional\r\nDirectories. To recall all names, dates and incidents pertaining to\r\nthe Reconstruction Period after a period of fifty years would require\r\nthe prodigious memory of a Macauley, even had I been an active\r\nparticipant in political affairs at that time. There may be a few\r\nerrors but they are of a minor character. I am glad that I am able to\r\nbe of some assistance to you in this matter, however, little, and I\r\ncan only say in the words of Macbeth,\r\n\r\n    \"The service and the loyalty I owe,\r\n    In doing it, pays itself.\"\r\n\r\n                                     Very  respectfully,\r\n                              (Signed) H.

As to Brokenton I probably was thinking\r\nof a Brockenboro in Washington and got the names mixed.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Washington in 1913 I let Whitfield McKinlay have my\r\nbook, \"Reconstruction in South Carolina\" by John S. Reynolds, to read.\r\nWhen I received your letters asking for assistance in getting the data\r\nrelative to reconstruction in South Carolina I wrote to Mr. McKinley\r\nfor the book. I wrote for it several times but not until about a month\r\nago did he send it. I did not care to delay sending you the data,\r\nconsequently I mailed it before the book came to hand. Had I received\r\nthe book in time I could have made my paper a little more readable and\r\navoided the errors referred to.\r\n\r\nAs you have, no doubt, taken data from the book by Reynolds I would\r\nlike to correct a few errors I found therein.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reconstruction Convention_\r\n\r\n  Colleton--W.

Hampton and Butler\r\nrepresented the State in the U. S. Senate, Mr Wilder was confirmed for\r\nthe fourth time, and as Columbia was the home post office of Senator\r\nHampton it is not likely that he or Butler would have voted to confirm\r\nan imcompetent colored man when senatorial courtesy would have\r\nsustained them had they objected.\r\n\r\nPage 229--W.

Hayne going to the communion table I\r\nhave to say that is all rot in so far as there were any objections.\r\nThe communicants with the exception of Mr Babbitt and family were\r\nnearly all colored. I know that the wardens and vestrymen were\r\ncolored.\r\n\r\nPage 234--I do not know about all of the colored men mentioned as\r\nhaving matriculated in the School of Law, but I am certain that Mr\r\nWilder did not.\r\n\r\nPage 236--William R.

Myers being the elector for the fifth\r\ndistrict I think it was his brother, Senator William F. Myers.\r\n\r\nAs N. B.

He moved to New Orleans where he practised law several\r\nyears before his death.\r\n\r\nAll the Republican politicians who remained in South Carolina _did\r\nnot_ sink into actual obscurity or harmless inactivity after 1876.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilder was postmaster at Columbia until June 30, 1885.\r\n\r\nGen. Smalls represented the State in Congress for several terms after\r\n1876, and was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in 1895. Was\r\nalso Collector of Port of Beaufort.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas E. Miller was also a delegate to the same convention and served\r\na term in Congress, and was a member of the S. C. House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\nW. J. Whipper was a member of the legislature.

Macon B. Allen was elected by the legislature as\r\njudge of the Inferior Court of Charlestown prior to Lee's election or\r\nappointment. Therefore Judge Allen should be given the honor.\r\n\r\nOf course J. J. Wright who was elected an associate Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of the State by the legislature was the first Negro in\r\nthis country who ever occupied a judicial position.\r\n\r\nPage 7--Henry W.

It was against the law for anyone to teach a Negro even to\r\nread or write.\r\n\r\nI am also told that I am in error as to giving him credit for the\r\nestablishment of the \" State College\" at Orangeburg.

I was informed that he was colored, but in reading\r\nthe eulogies delivered by the different members of the House and\r\nSenate, I find that he was not even an American. He was a native of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nW. A. Bishop, who represented the Greenville district in the first\r\nlegislature, was white, not colored. In the list of delegates to the\r\nRepublican meeting at Charlestown, May 9, 1867, he is given as white\r\nin Reynolds' book. I met a friend from Greenville about ten days ago\r\nand in speaking to him about Bishop he said that he was white and that\r\nhe knew of no colored Bishops in that district.\r\n\r\nOn page 9 of my data I state that Mr. Whipper was born in South\r\nCarolina. I met his son, who is living here, sometime ago and he\r\ninformed me that his father was born in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nWith reference to Judge Whipper I would add that one of the first acts\r\nof the first legislature was to elect a commission of three members to\r\nrevise and consolidate the Statute laws of the State and that he was\r\nthe first member elected. Quite a tribute to his legal ability.\r\n\r\nOn page 12 add the following names as from the North.\r\n\r\nRev. B. F. Randolph--Senator--Orangeburg district.\r\n\r\nW. J. Whipper--Member--Beaufort district.\r\n\r\nJudge J. J. Wright--Beaufort district--afterwards Associate Judge\r\nSupreme Court, and on page 8, under his name please state--born in\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nOn page 107 Reynolds' book--Abbeville Co.--W. J.

That both Mr. Sumner and Mr.\r\nStevens advised the committee to tender the leadership to native\r\nwhites of the former master class of conservative views: but this plan\r\nwas frustrated because they were not able to secure the consent of\r\ndesired representatives of the former master class to assume the\r\nproffered leadership.\r\n\r\n                                        (Signed) KELLY MILLER\r\n                                        (Signed) WHITEFIELD MCKINLAY\r\n\r\n                              WASHINGTON, D.

MONROE N. WORK, Tuskegee Inst. Ala.\r\n\r\n_Dear Mr. Work_:\r\n\r\nI was elected in Nov. 1894 as representative for Colorado county and\r\nwas re-elected in 1896.\r\n\r\nMy majority in 1894 was 168 and in 1896 at the next election it was\r\n450 as I recollect it.\r\n\r\nI was appointed on the committee on education and on privilege and\r\nelection and on agriculture.\r\n\r\nI introduced a bill restoring colored trustees which finally passed.\r\n\r\nI fought a bill establishing separate waiting rooms for the races at\r\nR. R. Station and killed it for four years.\r\n\r\nI introduced a resolution inviting manufacturing cotton plants to come\r\nto Texas. I introduced a resolution granting the use of the Hall of\r\nthe House of Representatives to the colored citizens of Austin to hold\r\ntheir memorial services for Fred Douglas. When one understands the\r\nrace feeling in the South this was indeed a triumph. I introduced a\r\nbill establishing a college course as a part of our curriculum at\r\nPrairie View Normal which passed carrying with it a grant of fifty\r\nthousand acres of land.\r\n\r\nI worked hard to help carry a bill through making any peace officer\r\nautomatically lose his office whenever a lynching took place in his\r\ncounty. This bill passed but was declared unconstitutional by the\r\nsupreme court. I was appointed by the speaker as a member of the\r\nvisiting board for Prairie View State Normal. As a member of the\r\ncommittee on privileges and Election I single handed fought for a\r\ncolored man elected from Brazoria county, N. H. Haller by name who had\r\nthe nerve to contest the seat of a white man to whom the certificate\r\nof election had been awarded. After a long and bitter fight in which\r\nthree times I carried in and presented a minority report we won and\r\nHaller was seated. This isn't the only case of its kind that I know of\r\nin this state.\r\n\r\nHaller of course had able legal talent to take care of his case.\r\n\r\nI voted for the purchase of the battle field of San Jacinto which is\r\nin Harris country about twenty miles below Houston. It was on this\r\nbattlefield that Texas won her independence from Mexico in 1836. It\r\nis now a beautiful state park. For this action I was publicly thanked\r\nby the Daughters of the Republic.\r\n\r\n                                   Respectfully\r\n                                           (Signed) R. L. SMITH.\r\n\r\nThe legislatures which I served in were the 23d and 24th.\r\n\r\nCharles A. Culberson, now U. S. senator was governor and our relations\r\nwere very cordial.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 I was tendered and accepted a position in the U. S. Marshal's\r\noffice for the Eastern Dist. of Texas by Pres. Roosevelt. Held same\r\nuntil 1909. This was the most honorable and best paid federal position\r\never held by a Negro in Texas except that held by Hon. N. W. Cuney who\r\nwas collector of the Post of Galveston. In 1915 I took charge of the\r\nExtension Service work for Negroes in Texas which I now hold.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME NEGRO MEMBERS OF THE TENNESSEE LEGISLATURE DURING RECONSTRUCTION\r\nPERIOD AND AFTER[29]\r\n\r\nBy Honorable J.

Sykes was a\r\nnative of North Carolina and had been a member of the North Carolina\r\nlegislature.[31]\r\n\r\nCaptain James H. Sumner, of Davidson County, was elected a door-keeper\r\nof the House of Representatives for 1867-69. He was afterwards\r\nappointed captain of a Militia Company which rendered the State\r\nvaluable service in putting down the Ku-Klux. Later by act of the\r\nLegislature a committee was authorized for Nashville consisting of\r\nthree persons to audit claims against the State for destruction of\r\nproperty by soldiers of the Confederates and Federal armies during the\r\nwar. Governor Brownlow appointed on this commission James H. Sumner, a\r\nwhite man named Lassiter, and J.C. Napier. They examined claims\r\namounting to millions of dollars, some of which were afterwards paid\r\nand others rejected. There were other colored men on such commissions\r\nin other parts of the state whose names I do not now recall.\r\n\r\nHaywood county first sent Samuel A. McElwee. He served from 79-83. The\r\nsame county afterwards sent Rev. D.F. Rivers who is now pastor of the\r\nBerean Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. Rev. Rivers defeated the\r\nfather of a very popular white girl and she met him in the street and\r\nspat in his face. McElwee made a very active member and was highly\r\nrespected by all. He was a graduate of Fisk University and the law\r\ndepartment of Walden University.\r\n\r\nWeakley County sent John W. Boyd who served two or three terms in the\r\nlegislature. He ran for the senate but was defeated.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was one from Hamilton county or Knox county.\r\n\r\nShelby county sent quite a delegation of colored men from time to\r\ntime. Among them were T.F. Cassells and I.F. Norris, who is still\r\nliving in North Dakota. Cassells was a lawyer, educated at Oberlin.\r\n\r\nMr. Norris was a successful business man of Memphis, Mr. Keeble was a\r\nbarber in Nashville.\r\n\r\nMr. Sykes was Internal Revenue Collector in Nashville and came there\r\nwith high revenue officials from North Carolina. He entered politics\r\nand was quite influential and finally died at Nashville.\r\n\r\nKeeble was of a family highly respected and of very high standing in\r\nNashville. The men from Memphis and Haywood counties were more highly\r\neducated than the others. They were free men of high class and up to\r\nthe standard of the whites who were sent to the legislature in those\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORED MEN IN OTHER POSITIONS\r\n\r\nAt one time the county government of Davidson County was run by three\r\nCommissioners; one of these commissioners was a colored man, named\r\nRandall Brown of limited education, but large experience and a large\r\namount of good common sense. He was very influential and highly\r\nthought of by white and colored people.\r\n\r\nNashville city government during the days of reconstruction had among\r\nits membership, perhaps, one-third colored members. These men were not\r\nof the same calibre as the colored members of the legislature. They\r\nwere picked up in the different wards by their friends. They were\r\nchosen for their popularity rather than for fitness for the work\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the reconstruction days, Josiah T. Settle was\r\nelected Assistant Attorney General for Shelby county under General\r\nPatterson who afterwards served as Governor of the State of Tennessee.\r\nMr. Settle had previously been a member of the Mississippi\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nIn Knoxville men have served in the legislature of the city\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen they changed the form of government in Nashville, there was a\r\ncolored man a member of the Board of Aldermen. Two colored men were\r\nelected to the council. As a result, two fire companies were given to\r\ncolored men. Mr. Charles Gowdey and Mr. J.C. Napier were the colored\r\nmembers of the council. The first two brick school houses were erected\r\nfor colored children during their term. They were the Pearl High\r\nSchool and the Meigs School. At that time the people of Nashville, the\r\nDemocrats especially, showed a very liberal spirit to the colored\r\npeople and divided the positions with them. Shorty after this with a\r\nmore liberal spirit, they erected the third brick school house in the\r\ncity of Nashville, The Napier School.\r\n\r\nAfter things went out of the hands of the Republicans in Tennessee,\r\nCapt. Sumner went down into Mississippi, entered politics and was\r\nelected Sheriff of Holmes county. He became quite wealthy. His family\r\nwas of high standing. Owned property in Nashville and the descendants\r\nstill own it.\r\n\r\nSettle and Cassells were free men. Keeble was owned by a very\r\ndistinguished Tennessee family named Keeble.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS FOR FREE NEGROS AND SLAVES\r\n\r\nIn Tennessee before the war there were schools for Negroes. There were\r\nno laws against schools for free colored people until the agitation\r\nthat brought on the war.\r\n\r\nAt Nashville, Franklin college graduated three colored men; that is\r\nthe school gave them graduation papers. They were prepared for the\r\nministry in the Christian church (Disciples). These men were Samuel\r\nLowery, Daniel Watkins and James T. Rapier. Lowery, Rapier and Watkins\r\nwere all free men. Rapier served a term or two from Florence, Ala., in\r\nCongress during the Reconstruction Period. He was a man of some\r\nwealth, was very active and traveled a good deal. Lowery's father was\r\nalso a minister, before him, in the Christian Church. He had a farm as\r\nwell as city property. Franklin College was a Campbellite Institution\r\nor what is now known as the Christian Church Institution.\r\n\r\nWhen the agitation came about preceding the Civil War they closed all\r\nof the colored schools.\r\n\r\nMr. Napier's father and mother with some other colored people had a\r\nman named Rufus Conrad come down from Cincinnati, Ohio, to teach their\r\nchildren. This was in 1859. Both free and slave children went to this\r\nschool. The school had been open two or three months when one day,\r\nwhile the class was spelling the word baker, an abrupt knock on the\r\ndoor interrupted the class and then a man entered without waiting to\r\nbe admitted. He said to the teacher, \"What is your name?\" The teacher\r\nanswered, \"Rufus Conrad.\" \"Where did you come from?\" was the next\r\nquestion. The teacher answered, \"From Cincinnati, Ohio.\" The man said,\r\n\"I have been authorized by the powers that be in Nashville to send\r\nthese children home, to close the doors of this school and give you\r\njust 24 hours to leave this town.\" This ended this school.\r\n\r\nThere were three or four schools in Nashville, before the war. One was\r\ntaught by Samuel Watkins. He taught school in an old church right over\r\na branch. It was built up on stilts, and was a place of worship built\r\nfor the slaves by their owners. Another one was taught by a Mrs. Tate,\r\nwho was of a very excellent family. Mrs. Sallie Player, a most\r\ndelightful teacher taught another one of these schools. Mrs. Player\r\nwas a free woman but her husband was a slave. He belonged to a very\r\nexcellent family of white people, whose slaves enjoyed every privilege\r\nthat free people enjoyed. They were protected by their owner. She was\r\na woman of some education. Her husband also had some education,\r\nalthough a slave. There was another school taught by a white man and\r\nhis wife whose name was Westbrooks. They came to Nashville from St.\r\nLouis, Missouri and organized a school. These two gathered\r\nconsiderable money from the free and slave people who wanted to send\r\ntheir children to school. They taught school about three weeks when\r\nthey suddenly disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVES IN BUSINESS AND NEGROES WHO OWNED SLAVES\r\n\r\nSlaves had more money than is generally thought. Henry Harding, a\r\nslave with some education, was a thorough business man from beginning\r\nto end. Everything he touched turned to money. His home in Nashville\r\nnow is as pretty a home as you want to see. He was allowed every\r\nliberty by his owners that a free person enjoyed. He was a carpenter\r\nand contractor. He did all the construction work on three plantations,\r\nthat of General Harding, his son's, John Harding and of David\r\nGavock's. One of the Hardings was his father. He was held as a slave\r\nuntil Emancipation in '63. He immediately came to Nashville and went\r\ninto business building houses. When he died he had considerable\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nHardy Perry, a slave in Nashville, had a line of hacks and transfer\r\nteams during slavery time. He hired his own time. Steven Boyd and Mr.\r\nNapier kept a livery stable.\r\n\r\nMy father's father was a pioneer iron man in middle Tennessee. His\r\nparents came from England and went to Dixon county and established\r\nwhat is still known as the Napier Iron Works. He was a man of\r\nconsiderable force of character and influence. He had four colored\r\nsons and daughters. He had these sons go to school along with the\r\nwhite children. When he died his will provided that they should leave\r\nTennessee and go to a free state or to Liberia. They went to Ohio and\r\nlived on Walnut Hill where they bought a farm. They concluded to sell\r\nthe farm on Walnut Hill, trading it for a farm at New Richmond, Ohio.\r\nTwo of the sons went to Richmond with my grandmother, another went to\r\nSt. Louis, Mo., and my father went back to Nashville. Two of the\r\nbrothers who went to Richmond with their mother became school teachers\r\nin Richmond. The one who went to Nashville went into the livery\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nMy father's father was a physician, having graduated from the medical\r\nschool of the University of Pennsylvania. He had great political\r\ninfluence and it was through his influence that one of the governors\r\nof Tennessee was elected.\r\n\r\nAlice Bosley, whose husband was white, and her family owned two large\r\nplantations south of Nashville and the other north-east of Nashville.\r\nThey owned about twenty-five or thirty slaves. She was a thoroughly\r\nreligious woman and every Sunday would have her slaves and children\r\nattend church.\r\n\r\nManse Bryant was another large land owner and slave owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  VIRGINIA STATE LIBRARY\r\n                       RICHMOND, VA.\r\n\r\n                                            September 28, 1916.\r\n\r\nMR. MONROE N. WORK, Editor,\r\n  Tuskegee, Alabama.\r\n\r\n_My Dear Sir_:--\r\n\r\nThe Journals of the Senate and House of Delegates for the years in\r\nwhich there have been Negro members do not indicate which of the\r\nmembers were white and which negro. The almanacs, however, do as a\r\ngeneral thing though the almanacs are not extremely reliable. I have\r\ngotten the following information from the almanacs. The first year in\r\nwhich negroes were allowed to hold office in Virginia was 1869.\r\n\r\nThe almanac for the year 1870 (which was printed the latter part of\r\n1869 and which gives, therefore, the members of the General Assembly\r\nfor the session of 1869-70) gives no negro members of the Senate of\r\nVirginia, but 18 negro members of the House. The total membership of\r\nthe House was 137. The membership of the Senate was 40. For the\r\nsession of 1870-71 there were, according to the almanac, no negro\r\nmembers of the Senate. For the session of 1870-71, I regret to say\r\nthat the almanac does not differentiate between white and negro\r\nmembers. For the session of 1871-72, I regret to say that the almanac\r\ndoes not give the members of the House of Delegates; nor in the list\r\nof the members of the Senate does it differentiate between the two\r\nraces. For the session of 1872-3 the almanac does not differentiate.\r\nFor the session of 1873-4 the almanac gives 3 negro members out of 40\r\nin the Senate, and 17 out of 132 members in the House. For the session\r\nof 1874-5 there were three negro members out of 40 in the Senate, and\r\nthere were 17 negro members in the House. In the session of 1875-6\r\nthere were 3 negro Senators, and 13 negro members of the House. In the\r\nsession of 1876-77 there were three negro members in the Senate, and\r\n12 negro members of the House. In 1877-78 there were 3 negro members\r\nof the Senate, and four negro members of the House. In 1878-9 there\r\nwere three negro members of the Senate and four negro members of the\r\nHouse. For the session of 1879-80 the almanac gives no marks of\r\ndifferentiation. For the session of 1880-81 the almanac makes no\r\ndistinction. For the 1881-2 session the almanac has no list of the\r\nmembers. For the session of 1882-3 the almanac does not differentiate.\r\nFor the session of 1883-4 there were 3 negro senators and 8 members of\r\nthe House. For the session of 1884-5 there was one negro senator, and\r\n7 members of the House, out of a total membership of one hundred. In\r\nthe session of 1885-6 there was only one senator out of a membership\r\nof 39, and only one member of the House of Delegates, out of one\r\nhundred. In the session of 1886-7 there was one senator and one member\r\nof the House. In the session of 1887-8 there was one negro senator,\r\nand there were seven members of the House. In the session of 1889-9\r\nthere was one senator, and seven members of the House. In the session\r\nof 1889-90 there was one negro senator, and three members of the\r\nHouse. In the session of 1890-91 there was one negro senator, and\r\nthree members of the House. In the session of 1891-2 there were no\r\nnegroes in either the Senate or the House, that is, none marked. For\r\nthe session of 1892-3 no negroes were marked. For the session of\r\n1893-4 there seem to have been none. I have not looked further, but I\r\ndo not believe there has been a negro member in either House since\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\n                              Very truly yours,\r\n                                     (Signed)  H.

THOMPSON, THE ORIGINAL CARPETBAGGER[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I might call myself the first Carpet Bagger.\" This\r\nexpression casually let fall by Mr. J.G. Thompson, of this city, in a\r\nconversation with the writer, was so striking and so suggestive that I\r\nasked him to explain. He complied, and in so doing, gave the following\r\nextraordinary narrative, which he subsequently consented to have\r\npublished:\r\n\r\nFrom the 7th of November, 1861, when Hilton Head was captured by the\r\nUnited States naval forces, the sea islands of South Carolina never\r\npassed out of the hands of the United States. Those islands and a\r\nconsiderable portion of the mainland were thereupon brought under the\r\noperation of the United States direct tax act, and were in time sold\r\nfor United States taxes to whoever would buy them. They were mainly\r\nbought in by the United States and were subsequently re-sold to\r\nsoldiers, army followers and Negroes. Towards the close of the war,\r\nhaving concluded my service under the government, I resolved to settle\r\nin the South, and purchased in 1864, a plantation on St. Helena, one\r\nof these islands, with the intention of becoming a Southern planter. I\r\nwas thus engaged when Andrew Johnson began his reconstruction efforts\r\nand appointed Benjamin F. Perry provisional governor. This was the\r\nfirst attempt at the reconstruction of the South, and South Carolina\r\nwas the first state called upon to resume its relations with the\r\nUnion, as she had been the first to go out. In October, 1865, the\r\nprovisional governor issued a proclamation setting a day for an\r\nelection of delegates to a\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION\r\n\r\nHis Proclamation called upon the people to repeal the ordinances of\r\nsecession form a constitution and make such preparations as were\r\nnecessary to obtain admission into the Union. St. Helena parish was\r\nentitled to one delegate to that constitutional convention.\r\n\r\nAll the original inhabitants of the parish, upon the approach of the\r\nFederal forces, had fled. There was but one man left in the whole\r\nparish when the United States took possession of the town of Beaufort,\r\nand he was found in a garret dead drunk. Consequently when the\r\nconvention was called the question arose who were citizens of the\r\nparish. There were few white natives of South Carolina in the parish.\r\nThe managers of election were not present. Governor Perry had named\r\nthe managers of the previous elections held under the confederate\r\ngovernment as the ones to conduct the election now to be held, but\r\nnone of these people were there. So a town meeting in the New England\r\nstyle was called to consider the situation, at which the colored\r\npeople were in a large majority. Probably one hundred white\r\nex-soldiers, army officers, settlers, clerks, quartermasters,\r\nemployes, etc., came to the meeting. An examination of the law of\r\nSouth Carolina as to\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT CONSTITUTED CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\nshowed that it required a three years' residence to be a citizen, and\r\nthat no person then a soldier of the United States could vote in the\r\nstate at any election. A long discussion followed, whether to nominate\r\na candidate or not, which ended in a decision to nominate. Then came\r\nthe query whether every one at the town meeting could take part in\r\nnaming a candidate to be voted for. The advocates of Negro suffrage\r\nclaimed that the colored native citizens of South Carolina had a\r\nbetter right to select the candidate to be voted for than any of the\r\nwhite men present. It should be remembered that at this time the\r\nFifteenth amendment had not been adopted. The point was made on the\r\nother side that only those who would have the right to vote for such a\r\ncandidate had the right to participate in the nomination. This\r\nproposition was voted down, however, by a large majority, and H.G.\r\nJudd, a philanthropist engaged in the work of educating the Negroes,\r\nwas nominated. Subsequently, however, another meeting was held by the\r\nwhite settlers who had acquired a residence, and who were entitled\r\nunder the laws of South Carolina to vote, having resided there three\r\nyears, at which meeting I was nominated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS ELECTION\r\n\r\noccurred the next day, and I received 36 votes and H.G. Judd 8 votes.\r\nThere being no authorized managers of the election, the voters\r\nassembled at the polls on the morning of the election and elected\r\nthree persons to act in that capacity. These persons made a\r\ncertificate that I had received the largest number of votes at the\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nWhen the convention assembled in Columbia, I presented by credentials\r\nand could have been sworn in without question if I had preferred to\r\nmake a statement to the convention that it might not act unadvisedly\r\nof the circumstances of my election. I asked that the credentials be\r\nreferred to the committee on credentials. It was so ordered and I then\r\nappeared before the committee and related the facts. After the hearing\r\na report was presented which stated that perhaps this was the only\r\ncase known to legislative history in which a man contested his own\r\nseat, and that all the evidence for and against my right to the seat\r\nwas presented by myself. The committee reported unanimously in favor\r\nof\r\n\r\n\r\nSEATING ME\r\n\r\nA long debate, however, ensued in the convention upon the question,\r\nand it was finally decided only by the close vote of 53 to 50 that I\r\nbe seated. George D. Tillman, now a member of Congress from South\r\nCarolina, made a very bitter speech against seating me. He thought the\r\ninsolence of this Yankee was beyond precedent in claiming to represent\r\nthe grand old parish of St. Helena, which had been represented in the\r\npast by Middleton, Rhett, Bull and other distinguished citizens of the\r\nState. In a speech that was really prophetic, he predicted that to\r\nadmit me would be to show dragons' teeth, and that ultimately I would\r\nbe followed by a horde which should devour the state.\r\n\r\nJames L. Orr made a speech in favor of my admission, and said that he\r\nhoped to see the state overrun with just such newcomers. I was,\r\nperhaps, the youngest man in the convention, and was surrounded by men\r\nof the first rank of the State. Scarcely a man in that convention but\r\nhad a title. There were ex-senators, ex-governors, ex-chancellors,\r\nex-judges and ex-members of Congress. It was the intellectual power of\r\nthe state to say nothing of ex-generals, colonels and ex-captains of\r\nthe confederate army. Probably two-thirds of those men had been\r\nmembers of the convention which carried the state out of the Union,\r\nand had looked upon that act at the time it was performed as\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROWNING END\r\n\r\nof a lifetime of agitation and anxiety. Now they were called upon to\r\nundo it all, but they seemed incapable of understanding the true\r\nposition of affairs, and were totally ignorant of what had been\r\naccomplished by the war and blind to the logic of events.\r\n\r\nFor instance, one of the questions early raised and referred to the\r\njudiciary committee was whether Negroes should be allowed to testify\r\nin the courts. Judge Frost of Charleston introduced a resolution that\r\nthe ordinance fixing the status of the Negro upon this question should\r\nbe passed by the convention. Chancelor Ingalls, who recently died in\r\nBaltimore, opposed the proposition, claiming that a sovereign\r\nconvention called as this was for a special purpose, ought not to\r\nlegislate. Upon the question of discharging the committee from further\r\nconsideration of the subject, there were but two votes in the\r\nnegative, Judge Frost, the mover, a man of 80 years, and myself.\r\n\r\nIsolated as I was from the start, I was treated by the convention with\r\nthe utmost courtesy, and when I occasionally rose to speak, I received\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDIVIDED ATTENTION\r\n\r\nof the members, and the rather obtrusive attention of the ladies who\r\nfilled the galleries. Such remarks could be heard as: \"There, that\r\nYankee is going to speak.\"\r\n\r\nAnother point that agitated the convention was, what laws should be\r\npassed to fix the status of the Negro, and, after a long discussion, a\r\ncommittee was appointed to frame a code of laws to be submitted to the\r\nlegislature, which should assemble under the constitution adopted by\r\nthis convention. The product of that commission was \"The Black Code.\"\r\nIts intentions and provisions were foreshadowed in the debates of the\r\nconvention. At the close of the debate I spoke for five minutes,\r\nclosing with the prediction that if the convention thought that its\r\nwork would be of any value to the state, they were mistaken. If the\r\nconvention thought it possible to provide a different code of laws for\r\nthe government of the loyal black citizens of the United States, from\r\nthat which governed the disloyal white citizens of South Carolina,\r\nthey did not understand what the war had accomplished. I said that I\r\nknew more of the\r\n\r\nOPINION OF THE WAR\r\n\r\nthan it was possible for any man in that convention or all of them to\r\nknow. While I spoke with modesty before men who had occupied high\r\npolitical positions in the past, I spoke with confidence as to the\r\nopinion of the people of the North who had waged a successful war\r\nagainst secession and slavery. Speaking for them I predicted that\r\ntheir laws would be made by major-generals and executed by\r\nprovost-marshals until the last man present would fall into his grave\r\nbefore the North would admit the state into the Union under a\r\nconstitution which did not recognize that all men were equal before\r\nthe law. When I sat down there was a dead silence and solemn faces.\r\n\r\nTo show the opposition I excited, let me give another anecdote.\r\n\r\nJames L. Orr came to my room one evening and asked me not to be\r\noffended if he requested that upon a certain question he proposed to\r\nbring before the convention the next day I would not speak in its\r\nfavor. He said: \"There are fools enough in this convention that do not\r\nwant anything that you do want, and every time you speak on a measure\r\nyou hinder its adoption.\" The proposition he had at hand was to\r\n\r\n\r\nREDUCE THE TIME\r\n\r\nrequisite to obtain citizenship in the state from three years to one,\r\nand after much difficulty he persuaded the convention to make the\r\nchange. He also wished to abolish the property qualification for state\r\nsenators. Tillman appealed to him in an eloquent speech to spare this\r\nlast relic of South Carolina conservatism. Orr, in reply, asked what\r\nin God's name had South Carolina conservatism done for South Carolina.\r\nHe pointed to what its condition was once and what it now was, and\r\ncharged South Carolina conservatism with the result. His speech was a\r\npowerful one, and brought the convention to his views, and no property\r\nqualification was thereafter imposed upon any officer.\r\n\r\nNear the close of the convention I asked leave to present a petition\r\nfrom 250 colored property owners of the city of Charleston, who asked\r\nthat the right of suffrage be extended to them. This, I suppose, was\r\nthe first petition of the kind ever offered in the slave states. A\r\nmember of the convention immediately moved that the petition be\r\nreturned to me and not received by the convention. Mr. Orr said that\r\nthe petition was respectful in form and ought to be received. He\r\nmoved that it be laid on the table. Another delegate moved that\r\n\r\n\r\nNO MENTION\r\n\r\nof the reception of the petition be made in the journal. I then rose\r\nto speak upon the last of these motions, but the president of the\r\nconvention entertained a motion to adjourn, and the convention did so.\r\n\r\nThe convention made a constitution which was not, however, submitted\r\nto the people for their approval. Under it a governor and legislature\r\nwere elected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK CODE\r\n\r\nwas ratified by the legislature, and many preposterous laws relating\r\nto the Negroes were passed. It was evident that the freedman was to be\r\nreduced to a condition worse than slavery--he was to be made a serf,\r\nattached to the land, and to be under all the disabilities of slavery\r\nwithout having the protection of the property interest of the owner.\r\nCONGRESS took charge of the reconstruction, and the new government of\r\nSouth Carolina fell to pieces, after a brief and inglorious existence.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was the first \"carpet bagger,\" I did not pursue the\r\noccupation. I never held office again in the state, although I\r\ncontinued to live there for sixteen years, and taking part in politics\r\nas the editor of the Beaufort _Republican_ and the Columbia\r\n_Union-Herald_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This account was taken from James G.

Charlottesville, Virginia, 1919. Pp. 199.\r\n     Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nThis is the fourth number of a series of studies in the race problem\r\npromoted by the Phelps Stokes Fund with a view to interesting a larger\r\nnumber of southern white scholars in this field. The seriousness of\r\nthe problem during recent years has driven home the thought that\r\nwithout scientific investigation it will be extremely difficult to\r\nfind a rational basis upon which the two races may cooperate for the\r\ngreatest good of the greatest number. These monographs are very much\r\nlike the addresses and studies of the University Commission making an\r\neffort to meet this need. Judged from the value of the monographs\r\nhitherto produced, however, one must express the regret that these\r\nworks do not measure up to the desired standard. The chief difficulty\r\nlies in the misconception that the whole matter of readjustment may be\r\neffected by using the white man only. He is to do the thinking,\r\noutline the method of attack, and direct the movement. The Negro, the\r\nother half of the equation, has not been invited to share this work\r\nand the writers making these investigations are unfortunately biased\r\nrather than scientific.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this monograph is to show the bad effects of Negro\r\nsuffrage which had no place in Lincoln's plan of Reconstruction or in\r\nthe early Congressional plan, but was forced upon the South by a group\r\nof aggressive radicals led by Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner as a\r\nmeans of their personal aggrandizement and of executing punishment and\r\nrevenge upon the Southern States. It is not true that these two\r\nstatesmen desired to force Negro rule upon the South. They tried to\r\ngive that section a democratic government. At first they advised the\r\nNegroes to choose for their leaders the intelligent southern whites\r\nand the Negroes entreated their former masters to serve them in this\r\ncapacity. When the whites refused to cooeperate, therefore, Congress\r\ncould do nothing else but make the Negroes the basis of the\r\nreconstructed governments. From this partisan point of view only then\r\nthe monograph is very much of a success. The writer suffered from a\r\npreoccupation of mind and in his researches was governed accordingly.\r\nHe knew what he wanted to write and found facts to assist him toward\r\nthis end.\r\n\r\nThe book covers in detail form the beginnings of Negro suffrage in\r\nVirginia, the campaign of 1867 in which radicals and Negroes drew the\r\ncolor line, the constitutional convention of 1867-68, the committee of\r\nnine, the campaign of 1869, the restoration of Virginia, the\r\nelimination of the Carpetbaggers from 1869 to 1879, the Readjuster\r\nmovement in Virginia from 1879 to 1883, politics and race friction\r\nfrom 1885 to 1900, the constitutional convention of 1901-1902, and the\r\nnew constitution. He, therefore, discusses certain topics already\r\ntreated in J.A.C. Chandler's _Representation in Virginia_, and _The\r\nHistory of Suffrage in Virginia_; J.P. McConnell's _Negroes and their\r\nTreatment in Virginia from 1865-1867_; H.J. Eckenrode's _The Political\r\nHistory of Virginia during Reconstruction_; and C.C. Pearson's _The\r\nReadjuster Movement in Virginia_.\r\n\r\nThe author makes a survey of the situation prior to the Civil War,\r\nexplaining why the aristocratic Virginians long since accustomed to\r\nrule even by excluding the poor whites from the electorate could not\r\ntolerate the enfranchisement of the Negroes. An effort is made also to\r\nshow that inasmuch as most of the Northern States prior to the Civil\r\nWar had not accepted Negro suffrage, it was natural for the southern\r\npeople to be opposed to such a policy. To strengthen this point he\r\nrefers to such authorities as Oliver P. Morton, Governor Andrew and\r\nAbraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe author considers the Negro a failure in politics and supports his\r\ncontention by a quotation from George W. Murray, who felt that it was\r\nthe mistake of the nineteenth century to attempt to make the ex-slave\r\na governor before he had learned to be governed and of Booker T.\r\nWashington who said, \"There is no doubt but that we made a mistake at\r\nthe beginning of our freedom of putting the emphasis on the wrong end.\r\nPolitics and the holding of office were too largely emphasized almost\r\nto the exclusion of every interest.\"\r\n\r\nSince the Negro has been eliminated, the author seems to rejoice that\r\nthe races in Virginia now work together in harmony and are friends. He\r\nbelieves that this relationship will continue only so long as no\r\nexterior factor disturbs the equilibrium and concludes with a\r\nquotation from John Sharp Williams who feels that \"It will be well\r\nthat wise men think more, that good men pray more and that all men\r\ntalk less and curse less.\" If the author really intends to set forth\r\nthe views of such radicals as John Sharp Williams as those upon which\r\nthe races may expect to cooeperate in the South, he might have added\r\nhis recent pronunciamento that \"when it comes to maintaining the honor\r\nof a white woman the South respects no law human or divine.\"\r\n\r\nThese observations are sufficient to establish the idea of the book.\r\nThe Negro during the Reconstruction period was a failure. The white\r\nman who has been restored to absolute power so as to establish social\r\nostracism, segregation and lynching is a success. In other words, the\r\nwhole study is from the white man's point of view. The Negro has no\r\npolitical rights which the white man should respect and unless things\r\nare in conformity with the white man's prejudice they are wrong.\r\n\r\nNo one would gainsay that the enfranchisement of all ex-slaves was a\r\nmistake. Oliver P. Morton, and Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, were\r\nto some extent right in their criticism of such a policy. It would\r\nhave been much better to have followed Abraham Lincoln's plan of\r\nenfranchising those Negroes who were owners of property or able to\r\nread and write and those white men who had not taken any part in the\r\nRebellion. While it should not have been expected that ex-slaves could\r\nadminister the affairs of the country it could not, on the other hand,\r\nhave been imagined that their masters who had begrudgingly abandoned\r\ntheir title to men as property would in a few years deal with them as\r\none should with human beings. As a matter of fact the black codes\r\nwhich the Southern States enacted immediately after the war show the\r\ninability of the aristocratic southerners to deal humanely with a\r\nsubject people. If, therefore, Abraham Lincoln's policy, of gradually\r\nrecruiting voters from such blacks as gave evidence of wealth and\r\neducation and from such whites as manifested a disposition to do the\r\nright thing by the country and by the freedmen had been followed, the\r\nmistakes of the Reconstruction would have been avoided.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _The Negro Trail Blazers of California._ By DELILAH L. BEASLEY,\r\n     Los Angeles, California, 1919. Pp. 317.\r\n\r\nThis is, according to the author, a compilation of records from the\r\nCalifornia Archives in the Bancroft Library at the University of\r\nCalifornia and from the diaries, papers and conversations of pioneers\r\nin the State of California. It includes also a record of present-day\r\nNegroes in that State. The book is illustrated with portraits\r\nexhibiting the life of the people past and present. The work is\r\ndivided into three parts, the first being historical, the second\r\nbiographical, and the third an account of the present-day Negro.\r\n\r\nTaking up the historical task, the author accounts for the discovery\r\nof California and mentions the important roles played by Estevanecito\r\nand the Negro priest accompanying the explorers. She then discusses\r\nthe rule of Spain in California, the Bear Flag Party, the landing of\r\nCommodore John D. Sloate, the admission of California to the Union,\r\nthe Pony Express, the right of testimony, the homestead law, the\r\nelective franchise, slavery in California, and freedom papers.\r\nAlthough intended as a continuous sketch, however, this portion of the\r\nwork, like most of it, is a mixture of narratives and documents.\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the book giving biographical sketches there is a\r\nchapter on the first Negro settlers on the Pacific coast, a pioneer\r\nlist and the Forty-Niners of color engaged in mining. Into this are\r\nworked all sorts of personal narratives without any organizing or\r\nunifying scheme as to place or achievement. Not much attention is paid\r\nto proportion. The author seemingly wrote all she had heard or\r\ncollected in each case regardless of the worth of these personal\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nThe same style holds in the treatment of the present-day Negro of\r\nCalifornia. There is something about almost everything. The Negro\r\nchurches and the Negro in education, law and music have considerable\r\nspace. The author next takes up distinguished women of color, doctors,\r\ndentists, literary persons, Negroes at the Panama Pacific\r\nInternational Exposition, and Negroes in the army. Then follow the\r\nnotes on the text which, instead of being given throughout the work as\r\nfootnotes are placed at the end of the work.\r\n\r\nJudged from the point of view of the scientific investigator, the work\r\nis neither a popular nor a documented account. When one considers the\r\nnumerous valuable facts in the book, however, he must regret that the\r\nauthor did not write the work under the direction of some one well\r\ngrounded in English composition. As it is, it is so much of a\r\nhodge-podge that one is inclined to weep like the minister who felt\r\nthat his congregation consisted of too many to be lost but not enough\r\nto be saved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _A History of South Africa._ By DOROTHEA FAIRBRIDGE, Oxford\r\n     University Press, London, 1918. Pp. 319.\r\n\r\nOne hears much nowadays about the history of South Africa and the\r\ndevelopment of that recently enlarged domain under the direction of\r\nGreat Britain adds further interest to the story. The present volume\r\ndiffers, however, from the type of most recent accounts of South\r\nAfrica in that it is a small illustrated work within the reach of\r\nthose too busy or not sufficiently well grounded in the social\r\nsciences to read an intensively scientific treatise. As such, it has a\r\nplace in the current historical volumes growing out of the\r\nreconstruction of the countries revolutionized by the world war.\r\n\r\nThe work begins with a picture of the country as nature made it. There\r\nis an account of early plant life, prehistoric animals, paleoliths,\r\nand prehistoric man. The early inhabitants are then given more\r\ndetailed treatment. Attention is directed to the Bushman, the\r\nHottentot, and the Bantu as each figured in South Africa. An effort to\r\ncontrast the country as the natives kept it with the country as the\r\nwhite man developed it, is a large part of this chapter.\r\n\r\nBeginning then with Prince Henry of Portugal the author presents an\r\narray of \"Great Adventurers.\" Following this sketch comes the account\r\nof the rounding of the Cape of Good Hope by Bartholomew Diaz and next\r\nVasco da Gama's voyage around the Cape to India. The climbing of the\r\nTable Mountain by Antonio de Saldanha, the landing of Don Francisco of\r\nAlmeida, the voyage of Sir Francis Drake, and the adventures of other\r\ntravellers appear in chronological order.\r\n\r\nThe rise of settlements in South Africa or on the neighboring islands\r\nas half-way stations, show the early importance of the country which,\r\nafter being conquered, soon experienced considerable expansion. Then\r\nfollowed in the seventeenth century an era of prosperity which paved\r\nthe way for better beginnings the next century under Governors\r\nHendrik, Swellengrebel and Tulbagh. The troubles of the eighteenth\r\ncentury when the settlements had to reckon with natives and foreigners\r\nconstitute a critical period of the colony ending with the capture of\r\nthe Cape by the English in 1795. Then follow the first British\r\noccupation, the restoration of the Cape to the Dutch by the Treaty of\r\nAmiens in 1802, the second rule of the Dutch and the second coming of\r\nthe British.\r\n\r\nWith the nineteenth century the British were to be free to start upon\r\nan all but uninterrupted rule of prosperity. The establishment of\r\ncourts, the rise of missions, the improvement in agriculture, and the\r\nextension of the frontier characterized the first efforts of the\r\npioneering British. Their relations with the natives and difficulties\r\nwith the Boers are treated in the chapters on the Story of Natal, the\r\nVootrekkers, the founding of the Boer Republic and the retrocession of\r\nthe Transvaal. The chapters covering the subsequent period consist of\r\na discussion of new influences, the Uitlanders, the Jameson Raid, the\r\nWar of 1899-1902, and the problems of peace and reconstruction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     RECONSTRUCTION IN LOUISIANA. By ELLA LONN, Assistant Professor in\r\n     Grinnell College. G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York and London, 1919.\r\n     Pp. 538. Price $3.00 net.\r\n\r\nMiss Lonn's book is an exhibition of the true scholarly spirit. Her\r\nanalysis of the situation in Louisiana politics during the period of\r\nReconstruction is most ably executed. She has neglected no source\r\nwhich would throw light upon this very anachronistic epoch. Public\r\ndocuments of all kinds, and especially those which embody the debates\r\nin the Senate and assembly of Louisiana have been made to yield\r\ninteresting testimonies of the passing shows of the years 1867-1876.\r\nNot content, however, with these testimonies, she has called to her\r\naid many other sources including the newspapers of the day wherein is\r\ndisplayed popular reaction towards the orgies being indulged in the\r\nState House. And thus the reader's mind, by means of most carefully\r\nchosen quotations from these records, as if by a lightning flash, is\r\nfrequently illumined; so that the whole comedy unfolds before the eyes\r\nin a most interesting fashion.\r\n\r\nThe book is not only filled with a wealth of detailed information\r\nconcerning the period, it not only tells the story of political\r\ndebauchery, ignorance and fraud; but notes also the few shreds of\r\nconstructive work done by the legislators under the coercion of public\r\nopinion. All of these facts are put together in a logical manner and\r\nshow that the author is not only gifted with keen analytic powers, but\r\nis also endowed with a peculiar faculty for organizing and marshalling\r\nfacts in such a manner as to weave a beautiful mosaic of otherwise\r\nwidely divergent elements.\r\n\r\nMiss Lonn has succeeded in writing a very interesting narrative and\r\nher book will hold the attention of a widely differing clientele. The\r\nstudent of American politics will find an illuminative study of this\r\nvery remarkable period, and therefore much food for thought. But this\r\nbook offers to the lover of fiction a new field. There is the hero,\r\nWarmoth, the villain, whose protraiture has been limned by a masterly\r\nhand. Little by little, sometimes directly and sometimes indirectly;\r\nsometimes by the words of his own mouth, oftener by the mouths of\r\nthose whom he attacked, and almost constantly by the unfriendly\r\nnewspapers, she deftly portrays the elements of his character. Warmoth\r\nhad almost unlimited power and he used it like Cataline to corrupt the\r\ncorruptible elements of the State. He was essentially a Nero, callous\r\nto the last degree and indifferent to the progressive anemia which was\r\ndestroying the State's finances. Like Julius Caesar he attained his\r\ngubernatorial power by making multiple false promises and kept it by a\r\nspecies of corrupt practices which were incredibly vile. There is the\r\ntragic setting, the broken, maimed, devastated State of Louisiana,\r\njust out of the War of Rebellion and struggling hard to regain her\r\n\"former glory.\" There are the carpetbaggers, irresponsible, predatory\r\nand indigent, of whom an army estimated to have been five hundred\r\nthousand strong invaded the State attracted as vultures by the rich\r\npickings of political conquest. There are scalawags, remnants of the\r\nConfederate army, also indigent, nevertheless troublesome and among\r\nwhom many brigands, murderers and cut-throats sprang up. There were\r\nrespectable Republicans and Democrats, whites and blacks who formed\r\nthe background for the tragedy of Reconstruction in Louisiana. There\r\nwere also the Manichean gods of sharply defined good and evil, sanity\r\nand insanity, righteousness and corruption, civic pride and utmost\r\nindifference; murder, theft, malfeasance, ignorance and crass\r\nstupidity. All these thrown in the pot of political regeneration made\r\na situation that was tragically immoral and horrific.\r\n\r\nDuring Warmoth's administration the legislature was a minstrel show.\r\nIt was worse than a minstrel show; it was profoundly corrupt.\r\nLobbyists openly paid legislators, black and white, for their votes.\r\nAnd what is more, the money was parceled out to each one on the very\r\nfloor of the Senate and House. This corruption was so rife that it was\r\nsickening; it is even nauseating now to read about it. He was finally\r\nimpeached by the Senate. When it became certain to him that the Senate\r\nwould vote for his impeachment he cowardly sought to nullify the vote\r\nby resigning and fleeing the State. But he regained his power and\r\ninfluence and held office two years longer. And during this time his\r\npower was so absolute that the fear of him is manifest in the Senate\r\nand House debates. Speakers in making charges of corruption, and even\r\nwhen speaking against bills aimed at increasing the power of the\r\ngovernor, always added, so great was their fear of him, \"no reflection\r\nis meant upon the present incumbent,\" or words to that effect. This\r\nalthough they knew well that it was his very abuse of power which\r\ncalled forth many of the bills under consideration.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely possible, however, that such abuses, such corruption\r\nand infamy, such vile and degraded practices as those which\r\ncharacterized Warmoth's administration as Governor of Louisiana could\r\nlong continue. So in 1871 came the crash. An open rupture in the ranks\r\nof the Republican party developed. The gatling gun convention,\r\nso-called, because federal troops with two gatling guns, guarded the\r\nconvention building, was held. Warmoth, scenting a conspiracy, bolted\r\nand held an independent convention in Turner Hall. With him as the\r\nleading spirit of the gathering was Pinchback, then majority leader in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nThe career of Pinchback sheds additional light upon this period. He\r\nheld a high place in the political life of that day, rising from\r\nmajority leader, by successive stages, to the lieutenant-governorship,\r\nand to the presidency of the Senate. He also became immensely wealthy\r\non account of his association with Warmoth, who is said to have\r\nacquired a fortune of more than a million dollars during three years\r\nof his administration. While Pinchback was Park Commissioner he was\r\naccused by Antoine of cheating him out of $40,000 at one clip. For a\r\ntime Pinchback was one of Warmoth's staunchest supporters, and when\r\nthe party in Louisiana was split by the two factions, the Custom House\r\nring and the Warmoth faction, Pinchback was elected permanent chairman\r\nof the Warmoth convention and made the keynote speech for the\r\ncampaign. Subsequently, Warmoth's utter degeneracy alienated him and\r\nso they parted company. Warmoth's star descended, and he went down to\r\nignominious defeat. Upon his name and memory were heaped derogations,\r\ncurses and anathemas. And unfortunately these will always be\r\nassociated with his memory. On the other hand, Pinchback's star rose\r\nto the ascendant and he was elected to the United States Senate.\r\n\r\nPinchback was a man of good breeding, education and culture; and if he\r\nyielded to the corrupt influences of his time, it was because he was\r\nunable to withstand the flood; it was because the corrupt hand of\r\neveryone in politics at that time, Ishmael-like, was turned against\r\nthe forces of righteousness in political affairs. For, at that time,\r\nas the author clearly shows, crime, corruption and fraud were so\r\nrife, so common, that they were taken for granted. And the moral sense\r\nwas so low, so negligible, that men did not think of their crimes as\r\ncrimes. They committed them simply because \"everybody was doing so,\"\r\nand unrighteousness filled the State as \"the waters the great deeps.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, by a species of corrupt and criminal practices which made\r\nthose of the Warmoth regime pale into the utmost insignificance, the\r\ntide was turned. Another party came into power and the lily-white\r\ngovernment was established. Out of such conditions as Miss Lonn has\r\ndepicted the government of all the Southern States sprang. This book\r\nhelps us to understand, in some slight degree, the curious political\r\nbias of these States. It is in part a heritage of unreasoning\r\nfear--not so much of Negro domination as of again being overwhelmed by\r\na flood of corruption let loose by their own kind. How this fear has\r\nexpressed itself in more recent times we all know too well.\r\n\r\nMiss Lonn closes her book with this fitting paragraph: \"And therewith\r\nthe curtain fell upon the last act in this long and weary drama. One\r\ncan hardly help feeling that surely if Louisiana had sinned, she had\r\npaid the penalty of her sins in full measure of atonement.\"\r\n\r\n                                             R. T.

Buxton, Bart., who belonged to that group of\r\nEnglish reformers instrumental in giving the death blow to the African\r\nslave trade. Early interested in the natives of Africa, the grandson\r\nsoon became associated with the Church missionary movement. He was\r\nlargely concerned in the establishment of two corporations, the Uganda\r\nCompany and the East African Industries, both intended to benefit the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with Africa, he often visited various parts with a\r\nview to studying the many problems arising in the commercial, social\r\nand political world. On these occasions many Africans were entertained\r\nby him and he maintained friendly relations with them so as to bring\r\ntogether the representatives of various interests to work for the good\r\nof all. His interest in the African natives is further shown by his\r\nservice as president of the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines Protection\r\nSociety and as a firm supporter of the Native Races and Liquor Traffic\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOwing to the printers' strike the publication of Dr. C.G.

V--APRIL, 1920--NO. 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEGRO PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM IN MISSOURI[1]\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD FROM 1865 TO 1875\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the eleventh day of January, 1865, the Negro of Missouri\r\nawoke a slave; that night he retired a free man.[2] His darkest hour\r\nhad passed but before him loomed a great task, that of living up to\r\nthe requirements of a man. His emancipators were confronted with the\r\nresponsibility of preparing him for his new duties and for the proper\r\nuse of suffrage which was to be granted him a few years later.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1865 the State had seen fit to prohibit the education[3] of\r\nthe slave because, although the educated slave was the more efficient,\r\nyet he was the more dangerous; as his training might aid him to make a\r\nbetter revolt against his position. But the qualities which were\r\nobjectionable in the slave were necessary to the freed man, if he was\r\nto prove other than a menace to the State. His emancipators faced the\r\neducation of the Negro fairly, and the same convention which had\r\npassed the Emancipation Act of 1865, drew up a new State constitution\r\nwhich was ratified the same year. This constitution[4] provided for\r\nthe establishment and the maintenance of free public schools for the\r\ninstruction of all persons in the State who were between the ages of\r\nfive and twenty-one. It further provided that all funds for the\r\nsupport of the public schools should be appropriated in proportion to\r\nthe number of children without regard to color.\r\n\r\nThe legislature, which met the same year, passed a law[5] which\r\nrequired that the township boards of education, and those in charge of\r\nthe educational affairs in the cities and the incorporated villages of\r\nthe State should establish and maintain one or more separate schools\r\nfor the colored children of school age within their respective\r\njurisdictions, provided the number of such children should exceed\r\ntwenty. Persons over twenty-one were to be admitted to these schools.\r\nThe same officers who were in charge of the educational interests of\r\nthe white schools were to control the Negro schools. The length of the\r\nterm and the other advantages to be enjoyed by these schools were to\r\nbe the same as those enjoyed by the white schools of the same grade.\r\nThis law further provided that if the average attendance for any month\r\nshould drop below twelve the school might be closed for a period not\r\nto exceed six months. In districts where there were less than twenty\r\nNegro children, the money raised for their education was to be\r\nreserved by the boards of education in those districts and to be\r\nappropriated as the boards saw fit for the education of the Negro\r\nchildren upon whom the money had been raised. The same legislature[6]\r\npassed an act authorizing towns, cities, and villages to organize for\r\nschool purposes with special privileges. This act, however, provided\r\nthat any town, city or village so incorporated should be required to\r\nestablish one or more Negro schools according to the law. At this\r\nsession of the legislature[7] there was enacted a law to compel the\r\nschool authorities in each sub-district to prepare a school census of\r\ntheir respective jurisdictions which should enumerate separately and\r\naccording to sex the white and the Negro children who were permanently\r\nresident within the sub-district. In case the directors failed to\r\nperform this duty the township clerk was to have the census taken and\r\nto recover from the directors by judicial proceedings the cost of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIf we were to judge from the constitutional and the statutory laws of\r\nthis period, we might conclude that the education of the Negro was\r\nvery popular and that his needs were well taken care of. But before we\r\ncan draw any conclusion we must study certain conditions. We must know\r\nsomething of the character of the men who were to enforce the law, of\r\nthe desire of the Negroes for an education, of popular opinion\r\nconcerning public education, and of the distribution of the Negro\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nThe State Superintendents of this period were well trained men,[8] and\r\ntheir reports show that they were faithful in the discharge of their\r\nduty. One of these superintendents, John Monteith,[9] showed great\r\nzeal in the establishment and development of the Negro school system.\r\nHe was born in the Western Reserve district of Ohio, a section noted\r\nfor its strong anti-slavery sentiment. He belonged to a family of\r\neducators. His father was one of the first presidents of the\r\nUniversity of Michigan. Monteith completed his education at Yale and\r\nserved for a number of years as a minister in St. Louis. Upon becoming\r\nState Superintendent, he wrote in favor of Negro education a pamphlet\r\nwhich he sent to each of the county superintendents. His annual\r\nreports,[10] to which we shall refer later, show the interest and the\r\neffort which this man put forth to develop the Negro schools of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes were not indifferent to the efforts which were put forth\r\nin their behalf. There is much evidence to show that they took an\r\nactive part in the establishment[11] and the maintenance of schools\r\nfor their children. In those districts in which Negro schools were\r\nmaintained and an honest effort was made to better the conditions of\r\nthe Negroes, they responded heartily to their opportunities. The\r\nfollowing quotations are typical of the reports which the\r\nsuperintendents in those counties were able to make in 1874: \"In most\r\nof the townships a commendable interest is manifested in the support\r\nof Negro schools, which I am happy to report, is appreciated by the\r\nNegroes[12] themselves. The schools have been well attended with\r\nconsiderable diligence manifested by the pupils.\" A.A. Neal,\r\nSuperintendent of Pettis County, reported:[13] \"The Negro schools are\r\ndoing better than could be expected under existing circumstances.\" The\r\nSuperintendent of Bay County said:[14] \"The Negro schools have been\r\nwell attended. The pupils have manifested great enthusiasm, and have\r\nmade surprising advancement in the rudiments.\" _The Journal of\r\nEducation_[15] which was printed in St. Louis, by J.B. Merwin in 1869,\r\nstates: \"It is a well known fact that our Negro population manifests\r\nthe greatest zeal in taking advantage of every opportunity for\r\nacquiring education.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this period, popular opinion concerning free\r\npublic schools in general and Negro schools in particular was not\r\nfavorable. The school laws of the State were in advance of the people.\r\nThese laws[16] were the product of a few statesmen who appeared at\r\nintervals, and who, in spite of well known social protests, pushed\r\nforward with great energy school laws modeled after those of the more\r\nprogressive eastern States.[17] The State Superintendent complained in\r\nhis report for 1867 that in those counties in which the southern\r\nsympathizers predominated, the people were either wholly negligent or\r\nbitterly opposed to their public school right. Three classes of\r\nopposers were enumerated;[18] those who believed that the public\r\nschools tended to foster infidelity, those who believed that the\r\nState, the county or a municipal body had no right to tax for\r\neducational purposes, and those who regarded as unnecessary any\r\neducation beyond reading, writing, and simple arithmetic. In March of\r\nthe year 1866, four months after the constitution of 1865 had gone\r\ninto effect, of the thirty-four Negro schools[19] in the State only\r\ntwo were situated in counties in which the southern element\r\npredominated. Thus we see that the attitude toward public schools in\r\ngeneral was reflected upon the Negro schools.\r\n\r\nThe school laws themselves, which seem to have been adequate to\r\nprovide equal school rights for all the children in the State, were\r\neasily evaded when the officials of a community were hostile to them.\r\nIn his first annual report,[20] State Superintendent Parker called\r\nattention to the following facts: No remedy was provided in case the\r\ntownship board refused to comply with the statutes. There was no\r\nremedy in case the local board of directors refused to hire teachers\r\nfor the school when the requisite number of pupils were in the\r\ndistrict. In this manner, he reported, the Negro children in many\r\ndistricts were deprived of an opportunity to attend school. Even where\r\nthere was no apparent hostility to the statutes and to the education\r\nof the Negroes there was a failure to make the requisite enumeration\r\nof the Negro children in many townships and consequently many children\r\nwere by the very law itself deprived of the benefits of the State\r\nschool fund. He pointed out that in the year 1867 many would thus be\r\ndeprived, since the law regulating the apportionment of the State\r\nschool fund, compelled the apportionment to be made on the basis of\r\nthe enumeration which had already been made, and which in many cases\r\ndid not include the Negro children. The law concerning the\r\nestablishment of Negro schools was abused here and there throughout\r\nthe entire period. As late as 1876 the State Superintendent\r\ncomplained[21] that in many cases through ignorance of the law and in\r\nother cases through willful disobedience of the law, schools for the\r\nNegroes had not been established. In the first case, he reported that\r\nmerely explaining the law had the desired effect and in the other case\r\nit was necessary to call the assistance of county clerks and of grand\r\njuries.\r\n\r\nDuring this period there was a growing sentiment in favor of public\r\nschools. This is shown by the reports which came from the various\r\ncounties to the State Superintendent's office, and also by the\r\nincrease in the number of children enumerated and by the increasing\r\nnumber of schools. In 1870,[22] the county superintendents reported a\r\ngreat deal of opposition and indifference to the schools especially on\r\nthe part of the tax-payers. In 1872 a majority of the county\r\nsuperintendents were able to report[23] a growing sentiment in favor\r\nof public education. They could then say that the enemies of this\r\ninstitution were becoming its friends. The State Superintendent[24]\r\nreported in 1874 that in the four years of his administration there\r\nhad been a steady growth in the popularity of the public school\r\nsystem. We can better appreciate the progress made in this period when\r\nwe remember that prior to the Civil War, the public school in Missouri\r\nhad been considered a pauper's school. The Constitution[25] of 1820\r\nhad provided: \"One or more schools shall be established in each county\r\ntownship as soon as practicable and necessary where the poor shall be\r\ntaught gratis.\" The attendance also showed a healthy growth. In\r\n1870[26] there were 280,473 pupils attending 7,547 public schools in\r\nthe State. There were 389,956 pupils attending these schools in 1872.\r\nIn 1874 the enumeration showed that there were 708,354 children of\r\nschool age in the State.\r\n\r\nAs sentiment in favor of the public school grew, the willingness to\r\nenumerate and to provide schools for the Negro children also\r\nincreased. In 1867 the number of Negro children enumerated was 33,619.\r\nThis was an increase of 13,709 over the previous year. Fifty-six\r\npublic schools were provided for these children. In 1869 forty\r\ncounties reported 12,871 Negro children and 80 schoolhouses which were\r\ndevoted to their use. The average school term was four and one-third\r\nmonths. In 1871 the enumeration had increased to 37,173, and the\r\nnumber of public schools to 212. These schools had an enrollment of\r\n4,358 pupils. In 1873[27] the enumeration had increased to 38,234 and\r\nthe number of schools to 252.\r\n\r\nThe work of the public school for the education of the Negro was\r\nsupplemented by two other classes of schools. In 1867[28] the State\r\nSuperintendent called attention to three classes of schools which were\r\neducating the Negroes in the State. In the first place there were\r\nthose supported by benevolent societies in other States. These schools\r\nwere generally supplied with white teachers and were doing good work.\r\nThere were then the private or subscription schools, which were\r\nsupported by the tuition of the pupils and in many cases these were\r\ntaught by colored teachers of inferior qualifications. Finally there\r\nwere the public schools as contemplated by the law. A few such schools\r\nhad been established in the large towns and cities.\r\n\r\nIn 1869[29] it was estimated that there were in the State 34,000 Negro\r\nchildren of educable age. For their accommodation there were 59 Negro\r\npublic schools with an average attendance of 2,000. This report also\r\nstates that the majority of these schools were taught in churches and\r\ncabins with walls admirably adapted for ventilation and for admission\r\nof copious shower baths of rain. The same year Colonel Seely, Agent\r\nfor the Freedman's Bureau in Missouri, reported 114 schools for the\r\nfreedmen. Most of these were public schools and the attendance was\r\n6,240. The ninth census for 1870, reported that 9,080 Negro children\r\nwere attending school in Missouri. Thus we see that the public schools\r\nof this period were greatly aided by mission and private schools.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 the legislature enacted a law[30] which gave the State\r\nSuperintendent the authority to assume the powers of the school board\r\nfor establishing and maintaining a school for Negro children when the\r\ntownship, city, or village, neglected to establish and to maintain\r\nsuch a school in accordance with the law. The same year the school\r\nlaw was amended[31] so as to require the township, the city or the\r\nincorporated village to establish one or more schools for Negro\r\nchildren when there was more than fifteen children in the\r\njurisdiction. A Negro school could be closed for six months when the\r\nattendance for any month dropped below ten.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to show that the State Superintendent used his power\r\nto establish Negro schools when the local authorities neglected this\r\ntask. In 1873, he reported:[32] \"I have established between 50 and 60\r\nNegro schools in the State without resorting to the expedient of a tax\r\nas indicated and authorized by law.\" In 1875 he reported: \"I have\r\nlevied taxes for Negro schools in three instances. The medicine is\r\ngood and effective and I trust it will be administered in every\r\nsimilar case in the State until the Negroes enjoy schools equally good\r\nin every way as the white schools.\" Thus we see that by the Law of\r\n1868 the State Superintendent had the power to remedy conditions as\r\nfar as the Negroes were concerned but there was no evidence to show\r\nthat he used this power prior to 1872, although there are reports of\r\nviolations of the law. In 1874 there was passed a law[33] which made a\r\nschool official subject to a fine of not less than fifty or more than\r\nfive hundred dollars, for the persistent neglect or refusal to perform\r\nany duty or duties pertaining to his office. In view of this and the\r\noffensiveness of the results threatened in the civil rights bill,[34]\r\nthe State Superintendent[35] was astonished at the number of\r\ndelinquencies and persistent evasions of the law.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner of Education was able to report in 1870: \"This State\r\nhas a larger proportion of schools[36] for Negro children than any\r\nformer slave State. Opposition to the education of the Negroes is\r\nrapidly disappearing. Their rapid improvement and good conduct help to\r\ndisarm prejudice.\" Among the methods of evading the law the following\r\nwere reported; the failure to enumerate the Negro children, the\r\ncomplaints of a lack of funds, and the plea of an inability to secure\r\nteachers. In 1875 the State Superintendent reported[37] that the\r\ncitizens of Calloway County, the most strongly southern county in the\r\nState during the Civil War, were evincing the greatest readiness to\r\nprovide good schools for their large Negro population. This, he\r\nbelieved, augured well for the future of the Negro schools of the\r\nState, since it indicated a growing kindly disposition of the southern\r\nelement of the State towards them. How great was the change in\r\nsentiment can be readily seen by contrasting this report with those of\r\nthe county superintendent for 1866 and 1867. In 1866 the\r\nSuperintendent of Calloway reported[38] much objection to public\r\nschools in that county on account of the impartial application to\r\nchildren of all races and colors. The only Negro school in the county\r\nhad been established under very discouraging circumstances at Fulton.\r\nIn many rural districts there were not enough children to permit the\r\nestablishment of a school and in other districts the existing\r\nopposition to Negro schools made their establishment impossible. The\r\nnext year it was reported[39] that the white schools were better\r\nfitted for pigs than for children and that there was no interest at\r\nall in the education of Negro children.\r\n\r\nAnother factor which effected the development of the Negro school\r\nsystem was the sparseness of the Negro population. In many districts\r\nand even in some counties there were not enough Negro children to form\r\na school. In 1871, reports[40] were received from 109 of the 115\r\ncounties of the State. Thirty-nine of the 109 counties did not report\r\na single school district with the required number of Negro children\r\nto establish a school. The other seventy counties reported 395 school\r\ndistricts having twenty or more Negro children of school age. The same\r\ncounties also reported 158 schools for these children. In their annual\r\nletters for 1872 twenty-one county superintendents called attention to\r\nthe fact that the Negro population was so distributed over the\r\ncounties that it was impossible to provide schools for them according\r\nto the law. Three of these superintendents asked that the law might be\r\nso amended as to provide for Negro children in the sparsely settled\r\ndistricts, and one superintendent advocated[41] that in districts in\r\nwhich there were too few Negro children to form separate schools, they\r\nshould be admitted to the white schools.\r\n\r\nThat same year the State Superintendent reported[42] that in several\r\ncases in which no schools were provided because of the small number of\r\npupils, that their parents had asked why their children could not\r\nenter the white schools since there was no direct law prohibiting it.\r\nThe next year[43] the Negro children in several districts did enter\r\nthe white schools with the tacit consent of the white population. When\r\nthe State Superintendent was asked whether or not they could be\r\nejected[44] he replied that there was no law to that effect. At this\r\ntime the enactment of a civil rights bill was being agitated in the\r\nState. This bill[45] provided that the public schools of the State\r\nshould be open to all children regardless of color. When the civil\r\nrights bill was defeated in 1874, there was passed another bill which\r\naimed to relieve the situation in the sparsely settled districts.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the legislature had passed a law[46] permitting two or more\r\ndistricts, each of which had less than fifteen Negro population but\r\nwhich when taken together had more than that number, to establish a\r\nunion school for those children. This law on account of its lack of\r\nforce did not accomplish much good. In 1874 the law[47] was amended in\r\nsuch a way as to make it obligatory for two or more districts, each of\r\nwhich had too few Negro children, to form a school to unite to form a\r\nunion school. It was also ordered that all taxable property in a\r\ntownship in which a Negro school was situated should be taxed for its\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 each district supported its own school[48] for white children,\r\nwhile the whole township in which a Negro school was situated was\r\ntaxed for its support. No district in the State could be compelled by\r\nthe law to maintain a school for its white children, but if there were\r\nmore than fifteen Negro children in the district, the law compelled\r\nthe local authorities to establish a school for them. If they failed\r\nto do so, the law directed the State Superintendent to establish and\r\nto levy taxes for the support of Negro schools in such communities. In\r\nthose districts in which there were too few Negro children to form a\r\nseparate school, union schools were to be established. The last\r\nmentioned law, however, was passed too late to have much effect upon\r\nthe period under discussion. School officials who refused to perform\r\nthe duties of their office could be fined[49] not less than fifty nor\r\nmore than five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the larger centers of the State where there was a large Negro\r\npopulation the necessity of establishing schools[50] for the Negroes\r\nseems to have been better realized. Thirty-nine out of seventy-three\r\ntowns and villages incorporated under the special Act for Towns and\r\nVillages, reported[51] a sufficient population for a Negro school.\r\nThere were 19,879 white and 3,609 Negro pupils enrolled in the public\r\nschools of these thirty-nine towns and villages. The length of the\r\nschool term was the same in the white and the Negro schools in a\r\nnumber of cases; but the average length was lower in the Negro schools\r\nthan in the white schools. The average length of the white school was\r\nthirty-four weeks and the average length of the Negro school term was\r\ntwenty-eight weeks. The average expense a pupil in these schools was\r\n8.1 cents a day for each white pupil and 7.8 cents a day for each\r\nNegro pupil. The average attendance in the Negro schools was below\r\nthat in the white schools. The average attendance of the white schools\r\nwas 61.89 per cent and that of the Negro schools was 51.86 per cent of\r\nthe enrollment.\r\n\r\nThe lower attendance of the Negro children may be accounted for as Asa\r\nMartin accounts for a similar condition in Kansas City.[52] In this\r\ncity from 1885 to 1913 a larger per cent of the Negro than of the\r\nwhite children of school age attended the public schools, but the\r\naverage attendance of the white children enrolled was above that of\r\nthe Negro children. This he accounted for by the poverty of the Negro\r\npopulation. Since the Negroes were poorer as a whole than the whites,\r\nthey were more poorly housed and clothed. Consequently the Negro\r\nchildren were more susceptible to sickness and to the disagreeable\r\neffects of inclement weather. On this account they were oftener absent\r\nfrom school than the white children.\r\n\r\nThe report of the State Superintendent of Schools for the year 1874\r\ncontains reports[53] from thirty-five of the urban communities which\r\nwere organized under the act for cities, towns and villages. Five of\r\nthese towns reported that they did not have any Negro children of\r\nschool age. The thirty towns reported 4,701 Negro children, 2,379 of\r\nwhom were enrolled in the public schools. Salisbury was the only town\r\nhaving more than sixteen Negro children for whom no school was\r\nmaintained, while Bolivar and Augusta, which had in the first case\r\neleven and in the second four Negro children of school age, reported\r\nrespectively five and three Negro children in the public schools.\r\n\r\nThe largest cities in the State were St. Joseph, Kansas City and St.\r\nLouis. These cities provided public schools for the freedmen soon\r\nafter the war. St. Joseph opened a school[54] with seventy seats for\r\nNegro children in 1866. In 1871 the city had for Negro children, two\r\nschools,[55] each of which was provided with one teacher. One of these\r\nschools had an enrollment of 96 pupils and the other 94. In 1874 this\r\ncity enumerated[56] 651 Negro children of school age, 386 of whom were\r\nenrolled in the two public schools. The number of teachers had\r\nincreased from two to four.\r\n\r\nThe first Negro public school[57] in Kansas City was reported in 1867.\r\nThe enumeration[58] for 1873 was 408 Negro children of school age. The\r\naverage attendance was 165. The length of the school term was forty\r\nweeks. The amount spent on each pupil was 7.5 cents a day in the Negro\r\nschool and 8.6 in the white school. The average salary paid to male\r\nteachers was $68.33 in the Negro school and $112.50 in the white\r\nschools. The average salary paid to female teachers was $45 in the\r\nNegro school and $65 in the white schools. In 1874 the number of Negro\r\nchildren enumerated was 885.[59] There was one Negro school in the\r\ncity for their use which had 356 pupils and five teachers.\r\n\r\nIn St. Louis, the largest city in the State, there was a steady growth\r\nof the Negro school system. The State Legislature granted this city\r\nthe power to establish separate schools[60] for Negro children in\r\n1865. The next year Ira Divoll, the City Superintendent, established\r\nthree schools for Negro children.[61] One was in the northern, one in\r\nthe central and another in the southern part of the city. In 1868\r\nthere were five Negro schools[62] in the city with a total enrollment\r\nof 924 pupils. Three of these schools held night sessions which ran\r\nfrom the first Monday in October of the year 1867 to the fifth of\r\nFebruary, 1868. Twelve teachers were employed in these schools. In\r\n1871 a sixth Negro school[63] was added and school No. 3 was improved\r\nto accommodate five hundred pupils. There were sixteen teachers and\r\nseventeen school rooms. The expenses for the year amounted to\r\n$11,787.80.[64]\r\n\r\nThe next year it was reported[65] that good buildings had been built\r\nfor the Negro schools. A gain of eight pupils over the number enrolled\r\nthe previous year was reported. This small gain was not charged to\r\nindifference, but to a decrease in the Negro population. In 1875 there\r\nwere twelve Negro schools in the city. The legislature of that year\r\npassed a bill[66] which permitted the city to establish a Negro high\r\nschool with a normal department in the old Washington School building\r\nand was known from this time on as the Sumner High School.\r\n\r\nThe first teachers of these schools were white, but they were\r\ngradually replaced by Negro teachers. The first teacher[67] of color\r\nwas appointed largely through the influence of Samuel Crupples, who\r\nwas a member of the Board of Education of St. Louis and also a regent\r\nof Lincoln Institute. He was so impressed with the work done by\r\nLincoln Institute in preparing Negro children that he favored the\r\ngiving of its graduates a trial in the public schools of that city.\r\nThe chance to try teachers of color came when the friends of a white\r\nteacher, who had been assigned to a Negro school, protested against\r\nthe assignment. From this time on the white teachers in the Negro\r\nschools were gradually replaced by those of color.\r\n\r\nVery early in the history of the Negro schools the question of\r\ntraining teachers came up. The white teachers did not care to teach in\r\nthe Negro schools and it was hard to find trained teachers of color at\r\nthis date. Ten county superintendents in their annual[68] letters for\r\n1872 mentioned the difficulties which they experienced in obtaining\r\ngood teachers for their Negro schools. There was a prejudice on the\r\npart[69] of both the white and the black people of the State against\r\nwhite teachers for Negro schools; and it is reported[70] that in many\r\ncases the white teachers in these schools did not take the interest in\r\nthe advancement of the people which was taken by the Negro teachers.\r\nThe positions in the Negro school, moreover, were less desirable than\r\nthose in the white schools because the financial returns were less in\r\nteaching in the Negro schools. In 1873 the cities, towns and villages\r\nwhich reported[71] Negro schools also reported an average salary of\r\n$46.70 per month for male teachers and $40.00 per month for female\r\nteachers. The white schools in the same towns paid an average monthly\r\nsalary of $87.72 to male teachers and $46.64 to female teachers.\r\n\r\nThe first school[72] in the State which was devoted to the work of\r\ntraining Negro teachers was Lincoln Institute. This school[73] had its\r\norigin in a fund of $6,379 which was contributed by the soldiers of\r\nthe sixty-second and sixty-fifth United States Negro infantry. These\r\nmen upon being mustered out of service at the close of the war gave\r\npart of their pay to found in Missouri a school where their children\r\nmight enjoy the blessings of a good education. The school was opened\r\nat Jefferson City,[74] the State Capital, September 17, 1866. Richard\r\nBaxter Foster, a New England white man who was educated at Dartmouth\r\nCollege and who had served as first lieutenant in the sixty-second\r\nUnited States Negro Infantry, became the first principal of this\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nIn his report[75] to the adjourned session of the Twenty-fifth General\r\nAssembly, T.A. Parker, the State Superintendent of Schools, offered as\r\nhis most important suggestion for the improvement of Negro schools in\r\nthe State, the establishment of a Normal School for the training of\r\nNegro teachers. He gave five reasons why such a school should be\r\nsupported by the State: first, the number of teachers were\r\ninsufficient to supply the rapidly increasing demand; second, the\r\ncharacter of the teaching in a large proportion of the Negro schools\r\nneeded elevating as white teachers of high qualifications could\r\nusually do better in white schools and Negro teachers of high\r\nqualifications could not be found in any great number; third, as\r\nNegroes had not, in many vocations, an equal opportunity with white\r\npeople, and as teaching is one of the most respectful and useful\r\nvocations open to them, they should be encouraged to engage in it;\r\nfourth, justice demanded it, for as a large part of the wealth of\r\nMissouri had been produced by the unrequited labor of slaves, it was\r\nbut a small return that the State should give to their children, now\r\nfree, the largest privileges of education; and fifth, the State gave\r\nno funds to institutions of learning above the grade of common\r\nschools, which were practically, if not by force of law, limited to\r\nwhite pupils. Equality of treatment demanded that something be\r\nappropriated for a school of higher learning to which the people of\r\ncolor could have access. If such a school could not be established at\r\nthe time, he advised that a sum of $5,000 per year should be given to\r\nthe normal department of Lincoln Institute to aid in the training of\r\nNegro teachers.\r\n\r\nActing on this advice, the legislature passed in 1870 a bill[76]\r\ngranting the normal department of Lincoln Institute an annual sum of\r\n$5,000 for the training of teachers. In his reports for 1872 and 1873\r\nthe State Superintendent commented on the excellent work which this\r\nschool was doing. But as this school was hampered by debt and could\r\nnot train the number of teachers needed, he advocated that the State\r\nshould take a greater interest in the school or better still, the\r\nState should take the school over entirely and make it into a normal\r\nschool for Negro teachers. The annual reports of the State\r\nSuperintendents from this time up to 1879, when the school was finally\r\ngiven over to the State, contained accounts of the excellent work\r\nwhich this school was doing in the training of teachers and he\r\nrecommended from year to year that the State should give it more\r\nfinancial aid.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1875 the Negro public school system of Missouri was well\r\nestablished. Elementary schools had been started in all parts of the\r\nState. A high school for Negroes had been established in St. Louis and\r\nthe first steps had been taken towards the establishment of a Negro\r\nState normal school. Popular opinion had crystallized in favor of\r\nseparate schools for Negro children taught by teachers of color. The\r\nprogress of the Negro schools had been somewhat retarded by a\r\nprejudice against public schools in general and to a greater extent by\r\na prejudice against the education of Negroes. Towards the end of the\r\nperiod there was evidence to show that this prejudice was dying out.\r\nMuch good legislation had been passed with the idea of giving the\r\nNegro children the same educational advantages as were held by the\r\nwhite children of the State. The Negro school system of this period\r\nwas in advance of the corresponding systems in the other States which\r\nhad recently held slaves.[77] The report of the Commissioner of\r\nEducation for 1872, shows that there were no public schools for the\r\neducation of the Negro in Georgia, Alabama, Delaware, Kentucky, and\r\nMaryland. Ninety per cent of the Negro school population of Tennessee\r\nwas without the benefit of public schools. Although the Negro public\r\nschools of Louisiana and West Virginia were established before those\r\nof Missouri, the greater illiteracy of their population in 1870 and\r\n1880 show that these schools were not as efficient as those in\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRITICAL PERIOD, 1875 TO 1885\r\n\r\nThe year 1875 marked an epoch in Negro education in Missouri. That\r\nyear a new State constitution was adopted. This meant the beginning of\r\na critical period in the school history of the State. In order to\r\nunderstand the educational trend of this period it is necessary to\r\nconsider the political history of this and the preceding period.\r\nDuring the Civil War the State had been almost equally divided between\r\nthe Union and the Confederate sympathizers; but the Union forces held\r\ncontrol of the government. At the close of the war and while the\r\nfeeling between the two factions was still very bitter, there were\r\nenacted very harsh laws[78] by which those who had sided with the\r\nSouth were not only disfranchised, but were also deprived of the right\r\nto practice law, to preach, or to teach. As the intense bitterness of\r\nthe war died out there was strong agitation to restore the right of\r\nsuffrage to the disfranchised citizens. In 1870[79] the Liberal\r\nRepublicans gained control of the State with the result that there was\r\npassed the next year a law removing the restriction placed upon the\r\nsouthern element. In 1872 the Liberal Republicans and the Democrats\r\nunited to defeat the Radical Republicans, and at the next election\r\nwhich took place in 1874 the Democratic Party came into full power.\r\n\r\nOne of the first acts of the new administration was to call a\r\nconstitutional convention which drew up a new State constitution which\r\nwas ratified by the people in 1875. With the return to power of a\r\nparty[80] which strongly favored local self-government, and which was\r\nsupported to a great extent by those who but a few years before had\r\nbeen reported to have been opposed to the extension of their public\r\nschool rights, it is not surprising that the progress of the public\r\nschool system was for a time checked. In many districts the people had\r\naccepted the public schools but they had not become thoroughly\r\nreconciled to the system.\r\n\r\nIn 1870 the local district school boards[81] were subordinate to the\r\ntownship boards of education. The clerk of the township board was both\r\ntreasurer and recording secretary of all the school districts within\r\nhis township. He was responsible to the county school superintendent\r\nand he made statistical reports to him as well as to the county\r\nclerks. The county school superintendents and the county clerks were\r\nin turn responsible to the State Superintendent of Schools. In 1874\r\nthe legislature[82] so changed the old statutes as to do away with\r\ncounty and township supervision. The office of county superintendent\r\nwas abolished and each district became independent. Even the district\r\nboard was deprived of some of its power and the right which it had to\r\nextend the school term and to levy money for new buildings was vested\r\nin the voters of the district. The new State constitution sanctioned\r\ntendency toward decentralization by providing[83] that the right of\r\nthe people to local self-government should not be impaired.\r\n\r\nAlthough the old constitution was very objectionable to a large number\r\nof the citizens of the State, nevertheless, it contained some good\r\nschool legislation and fortunately much of this was embodied in the\r\nnew constitution. The Constitution of 1865 had provided[84] that\r\n\"separate schools may be established for children of African descent.\"\r\nThe new constitution provided that \"separate free public schools shall\r\nbe established for the education of children of African descent.\" The\r\nlegal school age provided by the old constitution was from five to\r\ntwenty-one but the legal school age provided by the new constitution\r\nwas from six to twenty.\r\n\r\nThe decentralization of the public school system caused many abuses to\r\nspring up. Statistics became harder and harder to collect, and school\r\npractice less and less uniform in the different parts of the State.\r\nThe school law was disregarded to such an extent as to cause a\r\ndecrease in the school enumeration and enrollment in spite of the fact\r\nthat the population was steadily increasing. In 1875 the\r\nenumeration[85] showed 720,186 children of school age, 394,780 of whom\r\nwere enrolled in the public schools. In 1877 the enumeration had\r\nshrunk to 553,278 and the enrollment to 364,189. From this time on\r\nthere was a steady growth until 1880 when the enumeration surpassed\r\nthat of 1875.\r\n\r\nThe Negro public schools of the State also suffered a decline[86] in\r\nthis period. In 1875 there was a Negro school population of 41,916 and\r\nan enrollment of 14,832. In 1877 the reported enumeration was 32,411\r\nand the enrollment was 14,505. The enumeration did not equal that of\r\n1875 until 1885, but the enrollment of 1878 surpassed that of 1875 by\r\n6,376. The enrollment of 1877 was only 328 smaller than the enrollment\r\nof 1875. Thus, it would appear that while there was a failure in some\r\ndistricts to enumerate their children of color, that in those\r\ndistricts in which they were enumerated an increasing percentage of\r\nthe children of color attended the public schools.\r\n\r\nAs has been pointed out before, the emancipators[87] of the Negro, in\r\nattempting to provide equal school rights for the Negro child, made\r\nmore stringent laws for the enforcement of his school rights than were\r\nmade for the enforcement of the school rights of the white child. The\r\nState Superintendent was empowered to enter districts which did not\r\nprovide schools for Negro children according to the law, and to\r\nestablish schools for these children, and to levy taxes for the\r\nmaintenance of the schools. It is not surprising, therefore, to find\r\nthat the State Superintendent was called upon a number of times in\r\nthis period to exercise his power.\r\n\r\nThis official reported[88] in 1878 that the law in relation to the\r\npublic schools for Negro children had been repeatedly evaded and\r\nviolated during the two preceding years, and that a wicked and\r\nmalicious advantage was being taken of the ignorance and the weakness\r\nof the Negro to shield the law-breaker who was using the money\r\nappropriated by the law for the education of the Negro youth. The\r\nmethod of evasion was fully described. In the first place, there was a\r\nfailure to enumerate a sufficient number of Negroes of school age\r\nbefore the convening of the annual school meeting. After the meeting,\r\nwhen the directors were appealed to, they required the production of\r\nevidence that there was a sufficient number and then required time to\r\nlook into the evidence which took a month or more. They would then\r\ninform the Negroes that it was too late to do anything that year, that\r\nthey should have attended to the matter before the annual school\r\nmeeting and that they must attend to it in time the following year. In\r\nmany cases while the money due the Negroes was being used for other\r\npurposes, they were promised schools for the next year which the\r\ndirectors did not intend to give them. Sometimes the directors\r\npromised well and were then unable to find teachers or they disagreed\r\nwith the Negroes concerning the site of the school. The year would\r\nthus elapse and a new board knowing nothing of the promises of the old\r\nboard would be elected. The same course would then be followed\r\nsometimes with a little variation to suit the emergency. Finally the\r\ncase would be brought to the State Superintendent and after an\r\nannoying and repeated correspondence to collect the facts in the case\r\nand to explain the law, the officers were induced to comply with the\r\nlaw by threats of its execution. In counties at a distance from the\r\ncapital this threat was frequently of no avail because the Negroes\r\nwere either induced to drop the matter by promises of future\r\nfulfillment, were unwilling to proceed to law, or lacked intelligent\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nThe next year the State Superintendent complained that the demand upon\r\nthis functionary to establish Negro schools in districts which\r\nneglected to fulfill the law required an undue amount of his time. The\r\nlegislature which met that year, therefore, removed from the State\r\nSuperintendent the responsibility of enforcing this law. But it\r\nprovided[89] that any school district which neglected to establish a\r\nNegro school or schools according to the law should be deprived of any\r\nportion of the State school funds for that year. This was a severe\r\npunishment in a State having as large a school fund as Missouri\r\nhas.[90]\r\n\r\nBy the year 1885 the public school system of Missouri was on a firm\r\nbasis. The right of every child in the State to the benefits of a free\r\npublic school education had been established. The Negro public schools\r\nwere prosperous. The Negro school population[91] had increased to\r\n44,215 and the percentage of the enumerated actually enrolled in the\r\npublic schools had increased from forty-two per cent in 1877 to\r\nsixty-three per cent in 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF GROWTH, 1885 TO 1915\r\n\r\nA few minor changes have been made in the State statutory law since\r\n1885. Prior to 1889 not only the district but the whole township in\r\nwhich a Negro school was located, was taxed for the support of this\r\nschool. In 1889 the law[92] was so revised as to throw the entire\r\nburden of support upon the district in which the school is located. In\r\nthe same year, the statute which gave Negro adults the right to attend\r\nthe public schools was abrogated.\r\n\r\nThe last revision of the law relating to Negro public schools was made\r\nin 1909. By the present law[93] the boards of directors in districts\r\nhaving fifteen or more Negro children of school age are required to\r\nestablish and maintain schools for these children which shall have\r\nthe same length of term and shall enjoy the same privileges as are\r\nenjoyed by the white schools of the same grade in the district. The\r\nindebtedness incurred by the board of directors in providing suitable\r\nbuildings, hiring teachers, and maintaining the school shall be paid\r\nout of the appropriate funds of the district. If the average daily\r\nattendance for any month falls below eight, the school can be closed\r\nfor a period not to exceed six months. If there are adjoining\r\ndistricts in either or both of which there are less than twenty-five\r\nNegro children of school age, a joint Negro school may be established\r\nin either of the districts. The expense of maintaining the school is\r\nborne by the districts which established it in proportion to the\r\nnumber of Negro children enumerated in each. The control of the school\r\nis vested in the board of directors of the district in which the\r\nschool is located.\r\n\r\nWhen the number of Negro children residing in a district is less than\r\nfifteen as shown by the last enumeration, these children have the\r\nright of attending any school for Negro children in the county for the\r\nsame length of time as school is maintained in their own district.\r\nTheir tuition is paid by the district in which they reside. When the\r\ndirectors of a district neglect to establish a Negro school according\r\nto the law, the district is deprived of any part of the State school\r\nfunds for that year.\r\n\r\nFrom 1885 to 1890 the Negro schools of Missouri steadily grew. In\r\n1890, 70.8 per cent of the school population[94] was enrolled in the\r\nschools. This marked the high water mark in the per cent of\r\nenrollment. From this date to 1900 the per cent of the school\r\npopulation enrolled in the public school decreased. In 1899 only 55.05\r\nper cent of the school population was enrolled in the public schools.\r\nThe school population, however, increased from 44,214 in 1885 to\r\n54,600 in 1899. In 1900 there were 472 Negro schools with 769 school\r\nrooms with 804 Negro teachers employed. The Negroes[95] of the State\r\nreceived about $475,000 as their share of the State school fund,\r\nbetween a third and a half of the money appropriated for the support\r\nof their schools coming from the white tax payers. As the result of\r\nthis good school system, Missouri stood last among the sixteen\r\nex-slave States in illiteracy in 1890.\r\n\r\nSince 1900 the rural Negro population has been decreasing and city\r\npopulation has been steadily increasing. Lured by the prospect of\r\nbetter wages, shorter hours, and better educational advantages for his\r\nfamily, the rural Negro has migrated just as his white brother[96] has\r\nto the large cities. The Negro population of the small towns is also\r\ndecreasing. The populations of Kansas City and of St. Louis are being\r\nswelled by the Negro from the farm and from the small town. The\r\nproblem of Negro education, therefore, is largely a city problem. In\r\n1910 the Negro school population was 42,764. Of this population\r\n33,465[97] dwelt in cities and only 9,299 dwelt in the rural\r\ndistricts. The enrollment showed that of the 29,562 pupils who were\r\nattending school, 21,694 were enrolled in the city schools and only\r\n7,868 in the rural schools.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 St. Louis had a Negro school population of 7,233 and an\r\nenrollment of 5,811. Nine grade schools and a high school were\r\nmaintained by the city to accommodate these children.[98] In 1916 a\r\nNegro industrial[99] school was opened for delinquent youth, and\r\n$40,000 was appropriated to build two cottages on the city farms at\r\nBellefountaine for delinquent Negro children. The Negro schools are\r\nmodern and well equipped. Kindergarten classes are provided, manual\r\ntraining courses are open to the boys and domestic science classes are\r\nprovided for the girls. In the year of 1915-16 three elementary night\r\nschools were in session with an enrollment of 759.\r\n\r\nThe Negro school population of Kansas City is also well provided for.\r\nIn 1880 this city had a Negro school population of 2,035[100] and\r\nthere was an enrollment of 623 or of 30.5 per cent of the school\r\npopulation. In 1911 the Negro school population was 6,500 and the\r\nnumber of pupils enrolled reached 3,251. 54.1 per cent of the Negro\r\nschool population and 47 per cent of the white school population were\r\nenrolled in the public schools. The school property[101] devoted to\r\nthe use of the Negroes was valued at $465,565 and the value of the\r\nproperty devoted to the white people was $5,792,468. The Negro\r\npopulation which comprised 9.7 per cent of the total population had\r\npublic school property valued at 7.4 of the total. The average cost\r\nfor each white pupil enrolled was $42.20 a year and the average cost\r\nfor each Negro child was $35.02. In 1910-11, there were 86 Negro\r\nteachers in the system. There was one teacher for every 37 children\r\nenrolled in the white schools and one teacher for every 41 Negro\r\npupils. In the same year the Negro night schools had an enrollment of\r\n472. In 1915 there were ten elementary and one high school[102]\r\ndevoted to the use of the Negroes. The Negro school population had\r\nincreased to 7,637 and the enrollment was 3,654.\r\n\r\nIn 1915 there were fifteen colored schools in the State doing work of\r\na high school grade. Two of these, Sumner High School of St. Louis and\r\nLincoln High School of Kansas City are first class high schools.[103]\r\nThe Negro high schools of Hannibal and of Springfield are ranked\r\nsecond class and the high schools of Chillicothe and St. Joseph are\r\nrated third class. The other nine high schools are unclassified.\r\n\r\nUntil the opening of the new Dunbar High School in Washington,\r\nDistrict of Columbia, in 1916 the Sumner High School was considered\r\nthe finest Negro high school in the country. This school was\r\nestablished in 1875 and had only twenty pupils[104] in 1885. By the\r\nyear 1900 the enrollment had increased to 250. In 1907 the city\r\nappropriated $297,827[105] for the building of the new Sumner High\r\nSchool, a magnificent building. It is three stories high and is well\r\nequipped. It contains a large auditorium, and gymnasiums on the top\r\nfloor. On the second floor are laboratories, for the teaching of\r\nchemistry, physics, physiology, and biology. Courses for girls are\r\ngiven in domestic science and in domestic art. The school also\r\nmaintains a commercial department. In the basement there are shops in\r\nwhich the boys are taught carpentry, cabinet making, machinery, and\r\nblacksmithing. A swimming pool for the boys is also located in the\r\nbasement. There is provided a cafeteria at which the children can\r\npurchase at a small cost their noonday meal. It is possible for the\r\npupil to take any one of the several courses. He may prepare himself\r\nto enter a first-class college, to enter the business world, or to\r\nbecome an artisan.\r\n\r\nSumner High School also maintains[106] a normal training course for\r\nits girl graduates. The Cottage Avenue graded school is under the\r\nsupervision of the High School principal and it serves as an\r\nobservation school for those taking normal work. This high school also\r\nmaintains an evening school. In 1915-16 the enrollment was 457. The\r\nNegroes of St. Louis are very proud of their high school, and it is\r\nwell patronized. In 1915-16 the enrollment[107] was 811 and in 1916-17\r\nit passed the 1,000 mark. There were employed in this high school in\r\n1915 thirty-five teachers who received an average salary of $127 a\r\nmonth. The school has a library containing about 2,000 volumes and\r\nequipment[108] valued at $30,000.\r\n\r\nThe Lincoln High School of Kansas City, although it is not as large or\r\nas well equipped as Sumner High School, is nevertheless a good high\r\nschool. The first Negro high school[109] was opened in the Lincoln\r\nGrade School Building. A high school building was erected on Eleventh\r\nStreet in 1890. This building was used as such until the erection of\r\nthe present high school, the site of which was purchased in 1899 and\r\nthe new building was opened September 6, 1906. In 1915 this school had\r\nan enrollment[110] of 462 pupils. Seventeen instructors were employed\r\nat the average salary of $115 a month. Besides the regular high school\r\ncourses, this school has departments of domestic science and domestic\r\narts for the girls. Vocational courses are open to the boys and a\r\ncourse in military training has recently been opened for the boys. In\r\n1915 the equipment[111] of the school was valued at $10,000. The\r\nlibrary contained a number of valuable works.\r\n\r\nIn the development of Negro education in keeping with the policy of\r\nestablishing high schools the State in 1879 assumed complete\r\ncontrol[112] of Lincoln Institute. Prior to this date, the legislature\r\nhad merely given the normal department of this institution $5,000\r\nannually for the purpose of training teachers. The Thirty-fourth\r\nGeneral Assembly established an academic and a college department in\r\nthe school, and the Thirty-sixth General Assembly established\r\nan industrial department. The State has since then dealt very\r\nliberally with its Negro normal school. In 1915 the legislature\r\nappropriated[113] $116,600 for the bi-annual period of 1915-1916. This\r\nschool then had a campus of twenty acres, upon which was situated six\r\nmodern buildings and a model training school for the use of students\r\npreparing to teach. The school also had a farm of sixty acres. The\r\nproperty[114] of the school was valued at $222,202. There were\r\nthirty-one teachers employed and the school enrollment was 343. The\r\nacademic work is divided between a high school course and a two year\r\nnormal course. Graduates from the normal department obtain life\r\ncertificates to teach in Missouri. The following trades are taught:\r\ndomestic science and domestic art, carpentry, wood-turning, machinery\r\nand blacksmithing. The work which this school has done in preparing\r\nteachers for the Negro rural schools of the State cannot be over\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\nBecause of these many efforts in behalf of Negro education, therefore,\r\nMissouri stood in 1915 in the lead of the ex-slave States in the\r\nprovisions which it had made for the education of Negro children. Only\r\nthe District of Columbia stood ahead of it in the amount of money[115]\r\nwhich was invested in public school property for Negroes. The District\r\nof Columbia had $135.30 invested for every Negro child of school age\r\nand Missouri had $50 for each Negro child. Oklahoma and West Virginia\r\nranked next to Missouri, each having $26.00 invested for every Negro\r\nchild of school age. Missouri ranked first among the States in the\r\nproportion of the total school investment devoted to the education of\r\nthe Negro child. Missouri had 96 per cent as much invested for each\r\nNegro child as was invested for each white child while the District of\r\nColumbia had only 74 per cent as much invested in Negro school\r\nproperty[116] as it had invested in white school property for every\r\nchild of school age. If we leave out the District of Columbia, which\r\nis not comparable with a State, Missouri stood at the head of the\r\nStates, in which separate schools were maintained for Negro children,\r\nin the annual expenditure for every child of school age. Missouri\r\nspent $12.13 for every Negro child[117] of school age enumerated. This\r\nwas more than was spent by 12 of the southern States for every white\r\nchild enrolled. Missouri's nearest rivals, Oklahoma and West Virginia,\r\nspent $11.16 and $10.38 for every Negro child respectively. As the\r\nresult of her excellent school system, Missouri had, according to the\r\ncensus of 1910, a smaller proportion of her population illiterate[118]\r\nthan did any of the other ex-slave States.\r\n\r\n                                             HENRY SULLIVAN WILLIAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This dissertation was in 1917 submitted to the Faculty of the\r\nGraduate School of Arts and Literature of the University of Chicago,\r\nin candidacy for the degree of Master of Arts by Henry S.

The problem of religious education has become a\r\npart of our national consciousness. The term \"religious education\" has\r\ncome into general circulation respecting every grade of education. And\r\nin every instance it seems to be more or less a characterization of an\r\nideal type of education and a method of realizing that type. Evidence\r\nof this is presented in the numerous religious, semi-religious and\r\neducational periodicals, as well as in the reports and published\r\nstatements of educational institutions and organizations since 1903.\r\n\r\nThere is a new conscience for character and social usefulness in the\r\ncollege and university. It manifests itself in topics under discussion\r\nin conferences of educators, in their personal inquiries, and in the\r\nhearty cooperation given agencies for the higher life. In the whole\r\nrange of education there is a growing recognition of the religious and\r\nmoral elements inherent in all education. The former emphasis on the\r\ndifference between religious education and secular education is\r\npassing. The foundation of teaching is being lifted into the religious\r\nrealm. Education is aiming to develop men and women to their highest\r\npossibilities for their own sakes and for the sake of their\r\ncontribution to the welfare and progress of society. The National\r\nEducational Association is a potent factor in establishing a strong\r\nbelief in the worth of religion in education.\r\n\r\nThe Religious Education Association, organized in 1903, is one of the\r\nchief, if not the chiefest, agencies in hastening this new era. The\r\nsecretary has said: \"The leadership of this new crusade seemed\r\nsuccessful in directing a passion for religious education born of the\r\nfusion of the scientific spirit with the spirit of humanistic\r\nidealism.\" Between 1903 and 1913 over $120,000 was spent in religious\r\neducational endeavor. The period subsequent to 1913 shows a larger\r\nproportionate expenditure. The larger part of this sum stands for\r\ngifts.\r\n\r\nHow has the movement demanding efficiency in religious education\r\naffected Negro institutions? The status of religious education in\r\nNegro colleges and universities, considered quantitatively and\r\nqualitatively is the task of this investigation. What do the\r\nsupervisors of Negro institutions conceive religious education to be?\r\nHow does religion function in student life? These are questions\r\narising during the investigation of the problem before us.\r\n\r\nThere are 38 private and denominational institutions for Negroes,\r\nwhich do college grade of work with varying degrees of efficiency. Of\r\nthis number, thirty-four are co-educational colleges, two are colleges\r\nfor men and two are colleges for women. There are six State colleges\r\nwhich do some college work. These are all land-grant colleges with\r\ndonations from the respective States in which they are located. There\r\nare several so-called colleges having curricula for college grade of\r\nwork prescribed but no students matriculated to take the courses. They\r\nare not included in this study for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nThe terms \"colleges and universities\" are by no means safe criteria\r\nfor measuring the efficiency of, or even for classification of Negro\r\ncolleges and universities. This condition is not peculiar to Negro\r\ncolleges. Those for whites, in the South especially, present the same\r\ncondition of variety. It seems that there has been a special mania, in\r\nour South Land especially, for setting up a laudable ideal in the\r\nclassification of educational institutions, and then working up to it\r\nduring subsequent ages. They believe there is much in a name or title.\r\nThis keen sense of potentiality being in the classification, college\r\nor university, is too often misleading if taken on faith.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of this classification may throw some light on the\r\nnumerous Negro \"colleges\" with such wide divergences in standards of\r\ncurricula. In the South, $9,000,000 are spent for the elementary\r\neducation of the Negro, when $25,000,000 should be used for that\r\npurpose by the States. There are 1,000,000 without any school\r\nfacilities at all, and 2,000,000 who cannot read or write. Then the\r\nmoney spent does not begin to meet the needs of those who are\r\nreceiving the education given. For example, the South spends $10.23\r\nfor each white student of elementary age and $2.82 for each Negro\r\nstudent of the same age now given the opportunity to attend school.\r\nThus many institutions of a private nature are stimulated by this\r\nState of affairs and seek to meet it. But in so doing, they are\r\nactuated by various motives and perhaps they all could not justly be\r\nlabelled sinister. It is evident then that our study deals with 38\r\nprivate colleges, all denominational except four, and six State\r\ncolleges on land-grant bases.\r\n\r\nThe method of the thesis, therefore, has assumed a four-fold form. The\r\nwriter took nine months in making personal investigation of twelve\r\ntypical Negro colleges. One in the Northwest, one in the Northeast,\r\nand ten in the South. Of these ten, five are in Georgia, two in South\r\nCarolina, two in Tennessee and one in Alabama. The second method was\r\nthe questionnaire. Questionnaire No. 1 was sent to 60 educational\r\ninstitutions. 38 responded in full. Eight returned the questionnaires\r\nwith some answers. These were excluded from the study because they\r\nlacked desired data. A second questionnaire was used. It contained\r\ndata from students in the respective institutions considered typical.\r\nThe Y.M.C.A. leaders also contributed to this sort of data.\r\n\r\nQuestionnaire No. I follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n               RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN NEGRO COLLEGES\r\n\r\n     1. Name of the institution, president and dean.\r\n\r\n     2. Enrollment in the college department.\r\n\r\n     3. What religious services are held by the school? Is attendance\r\n     required and what number attend?\r\n\r\n     4. What curriculum courses in religious education have you, viz:\r\n     Bible courses, Sunday School Teacher Training, Psychology of\r\n     Religion, Philosophy of Religion, Religious Pedagogy, Social\r\n     Service, Social Ethics, Methods of Social Reform, etc.\r\n\r\n     5. Which of the courses are elective and which are required? How\r\n     much credit is given for each?\r\n\r\n     6. Have you any courses in the Seminary or Divinity School for\r\n     which you give college credit? What are they?\r\n\r\n     7. Are the teachers of curriculum courses of religious education\r\n     professionally trained for their task, for example; were they\r\n     trained in a school of religious education or in a divinity\r\n     school? What institution attended and what degrees received?\r\n\r\n     8. How many students are in your curriculum courses of religious\r\n     education?\r\n\r\n     9. What voluntary religious organizations have you, for example:\r\n     the Y.M.C.A., Students Volunteer Movement, B.Y.P.U., C.E. League,\r\n     College Church, Sunday School, etc.?\r\n\r\n     10. Are the teachers or conductors of your voluntary\r\n     organizations professionally trained (viz, as in question 7)?\r\n\r\n     11. How many students are enrolled in your voluntary\r\n     organizations?\r\n\r\n     12. What opportunity have the students for the expression of\r\n     ideals received through these organizations? What Christian work\r\n     is done, such as handling boys' or girls' clubs, ministering to\r\n     the poor and infirm, orphans, foreign missions, visiting prisons,\r\n     asylums, or orphanages, teaching vacation Bible schools, etc.?\r\n\r\n     13. What is your own estimate of the religious value of your\r\n     courses and organizations? Have you any definite data upon which\r\n     to base your estimate?\r\n\r\n     14. Does your school have a special appropriation for religious\r\n     work, viz: for the Y.M.C.A., for a chaplain, college pastor,\r\n     etc.?\r\n\r\n     15. In your opinion, are the Negro colleges meeting the needs of\r\n     definite religious training?\r\n\r\n     16. Any other information or suggestion concerning religious\r\n     education in Negro colleges will be gladly received.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       QUESTIONNAIRE NO. II\r\n\r\n     1. What is your estimate of the religious services at your\r\n     college, viz: Church preaching service, Sunday School, Young\r\n     People 's meetings, Week-day Prayer meetings, Week of Prayer for\r\n     colleges, Y.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A. or any other religious service?\r\n     (Mark each according to your estimate as Church 1, Prayer meeting\r\n     2, Y.W.C.A. 3, etc.)\r\n\r\n     2. What are the items of importance in these respective services,\r\n     the sermon, prayer, ritual, congregational singing, special\r\n     music, etc.?\r\n\r\n     3. Why did you make the preceding ranking as you did?\r\n\r\n     4. What suggestion have you to offer for the improvement of these\r\n     services? What other criticism have you to offer on these\r\n     services?\r\n\r\n     5. What is your church affiliation? For example, Baptist,\r\n     Methodist, Presbyterian, etc.?\r\n\r\nThe majority of Negro institutions--all included in this study--have\r\npublished statements concerning religious education in their\r\nrespective curricula and voluntary organizations. These statements\r\nappear in announcements, catalogues, and reports. These have been\r\nsecured and critically reviewed. From these the spirit of religious\r\neducation, the attitude towards the work, their aim, their own ideas\r\nas to value of results obtained from such instruction may in a large\r\nmeasure be determined.\r\n\r\nThe last means resorted to were the reports of denominations on\r\neducation. These reports appear in various forms, sometimes in year\r\nbooks, and at other times in the quadrennial reports, viz: the General\r\nConference reports of the Methodist Episcopal, the African Methodist\r\nEpiscopal, the A. M. E. Zion and Colored Methodist Episcopal Churches.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN PRIVATE AND DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGES AND\r\nUNIVERSITIES\r\n\r\nLet us first direct our attention to the work as it is being conducted\r\nin private and sectarian schools. The most important factor in this\r\nstudy is the teacher. What is the type of teachers in Negro\r\ninstitutions, for the progressive socialization of the individuals\r\nwhom they instruct? The student's religious life will be conditioned\r\nvery likely, by the teachers in the colleges. The preparation of the\r\nteacher then requires careful consideration.\r\n\r\nThere are 86 teachers of religious education in some form in these\r\ninstitutions. Of these 86 instructors, 64 have had some degree of\r\nprofessional training for their tasks. Thirty-one of those who have\r\nreceived professional training are graduates of first rank\r\ninstitutions. The institutions in which they were trained are among\r\nthe best in the country and of long standing. The distribution shows:\r\nYale College 1; Yale Divinity School 3; Drew Theological Seminary 3;\r\nOberlin College and Divinity School 2; Ohio Wesleyan University 1;\r\nColumbia University 1; Union Seminary 1; Boston University 2; Colgate\r\nUniversity 1; Rochester Theological Seminary 2; the University of\r\nChicago and Divinity School 3; Princeton University 2; Newton\r\nTheological Seminary 2; the Chicago Bible Training School 2; Grinnell\r\nCollege 1; Hillsdale College 1; New York School of Philanthropy 1;\r\nAndover Theological Seminary 1; Union Theological Seminary 1; and the\r\nChicago Theological Seminary 1. The remaining 33 teachers were trained\r\nin Negro seminaries and colleges, the most of them coming from the\r\nolder institutions for Negroes, such as Wilberforce, Howard, Lincoln,\r\nTalladega, and Fisk.\r\n\r\nThough these latter have had some type of professional training, it\r\nstill remains for us to see the types. The classical theological\r\ncourse claims most of this number as its representatives. We should be\r\nsurprised if it were otherwise, because it has been comparatively\r\nrecent that the seminaries of America have begun what they term a\r\nreconstruction of the seminary curriculum. The most of these men and\r\nwomen were middle-aged persons and had taken their courses before the\r\nevolution took place. Of the sixty-four who have had professional\r\ntraining, forty-five have had the traditional seminary courses which\r\ncontained no work in \"scientific religious education.\" I am not at\r\nthis point arguing whether they were the losers or gainers. I am\r\nsimply stating a fact in terms which all students of religious\r\neducation understand. The remaining nineteen had received courses in\r\nscientific religious education, either theoretical and laboratory\r\nexercises, or laboratory courses in practical social service and\r\nphilanthropy. 57 of these teachers are ministers.\r\n\r\nIn this study it was discovered that very few of the teachers of\r\nreligious education have chairs of Religious Education. Most of them\r\ngive only part of their time to that work and their programs are\r\ndivided up to meet the urgent needs of other departments in the\r\ncolleges and universities. Three are teachers of education and give\r\ncourses in the Psychology of Religion, the Psychology of the Bible,\r\nand the Educational Method applied to the Bible. Those three give the\r\nrest of their time to the college and normal school courses in\r\nEducation. Four have chairs established for teaching the Bible and\r\ngive almost all of their time to this work. All others are only\r\noccasional religious education teachers, so far as curriculum courses\r\nare concerned.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the attitude of these teachers toward their task? In the\r\nfirst place we note a large amount of optimism over results achieved\r\nor thought or hoped to be achieved. Sixty-four of them said directly,\r\nin answer to a question concerning their attitude and estimate, that\r\nthey were optimistic. Seven were uncertain, and withheld their\r\nopinions and three were very pessimistic indeed. The presidents and\r\ndeans answering the major questionnaire were quite certain that the\r\nteachers had the attitude of sustained interest in the work of\r\nreligious education.\r\n\r\nTeachers and conductors of voluntary religious courses and\r\norganizations were found helpful. Much of the work in religious\r\ntraining in Negro colleges is done by voluntary organization, some of\r\nthe most prominent of which are the Young Men's Christian Association,\r\nthe Young Women's Christian Association, the Student Volunteer\r\nMovement associations, the Young People's Societies of the various\r\ndenominations and Temperance Societies. Sometimes they are centralized\r\nand sometimes otherwise. But our task here is to see what preparation\r\nthe leaders and instructors of these organizations have received, the\r\ntime given and the attitude.\r\n\r\nThese volunteers are, for the most part, not professionally trained.\r\nOnly seven are so reported, and six of the seven are professors who\r\ngive Bible or social service courses upon the invitation of these\r\nvoluntary organizations. There is in all America, so far as has been\r\nascertained, only one Negro college that has a paid professionally\r\ntrained director of one of these organizations. Perhaps it would not\r\nbe unjust to name that institution, on account of its uniqueness, at\r\nleast. It is Howard University. The leader is the Y. M. C. A.\r\nsecretary who has been trained at the Y. M. C. A. Training School and\r\nis a salaried officer of the University.\r\n\r\nThe most accurate account given of the amount of time spent by these\r\ninstructors and conductors is found in the reports of the Young Men's\r\nChristian Association. There are 36 Young Men's Christian Associations\r\nand 36 Young Women's Christian Associations in the institutions\r\nrepresented in this study. The average time spent per week for the\r\nleaders of these two organizations is one hour and forty-seven\r\nminutes. Of this time one hour is spent in the weekly meetings and the\r\nother forty-six minutes in meeting committees, planning for activities\r\nof the associations, or in conducting Bible study, Mission study or\r\nsocial service classes. Extra time not counted in the estimate is\r\ngiven on extraordinary occasions.\r\n\r\nThe average time given to the young people's meetings is an hour and\r\ntwelve minutes. About the same would no doubt represent the other\r\nvoluntary organizations, the social service work excepted perhaps. The\r\npresent study has data only on the time spent in certain cases. The\r\nattitude of the volunteer is, as would be expected, usually that of\r\noptimism and sustained interest. He or she is selected by the\r\nstudents, and on the basis of some manifested interest in the\r\nparticular line of endeavor.\r\n\r\nThe courses of religious education will give further light in this\r\nstudy. The courses are not the only agencies, besides the teachers,\r\nfor assisting college men and women in acquiring a religious\r\npersonality which will function efficiently in society. Nevertheless,\r\nthey are one of the factors and are connected with the educative\r\nprocess in such a way that any endeavor similar to the present one\r\nmust consider them. What then are the courses included in the\r\ncurricula of these institutions? How much credit is given for them,\r\nand how many students are affected by them? These queries are\r\nnecessary to find the part which intellectual knowledge plays in the\r\neducative process, in behalf of religious education. Does intellectual\r\nknowledge of this particular type function religiously in the lives of\r\nthe students?\r\n\r\nLet us first investigate the required courses of the curriculum. The\r\nBible is the leader in the list of requirements. Thirty-six colleges\r\nand universities require it as a text book. Three give it as an\r\nelective and one does not offer it at all. These exceptions are Howard\r\nUniversity, Talladega College, Tillotson College and Straight College\r\nrespectively. Social Ethics is prescribed by ten colleges as follows:\r\nAllen University, Lane College, Clark University, Paine College, Roger\r\nWilliams College, Rust College, Samuel Houston College, Shorter\r\nCollege, Spellman Seminary, and Virginia Theological Seminary and\r\nCollege. Bishop College, Claflin University, Clark University,\r\nKnoxville College and Samuel Houston College have required their\r\nstudents at some stages in their college courses to study Christian\r\nEvidences. Morris Brown University, Paine College, and Swift Memorial\r\nCollege prescribe courses in social service or Practical Sociology.\r\n\r\nComparative Religion, a course in Sunday School Teacher Training, New\r\nTestament History, Philosophy of Religion and Church History are\r\ndesignated as requirements by State University, Knoxville College,\r\nLane College, Paine College and Knoxville College respectively.\r\nSpellman Seminary, Tougaloo, State University, Fisk University, and\r\nClaflin University require courses in Hebrew History. The requirements\r\nin Negro colleges are as follows: thirty-five require the Bible as a\r\ntext book; ten prescribe Social Ethics; six prescribe Christian\r\nEvidences; three make courses in Social Service or Practical Sociology\r\nrequirements; five prescribe Hebrew History; one college requires\r\nComparative Religion; one, Sunday School Teacher Training; one, New\r\nTestament History; one, Philosophy of Religion; and two, Church\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\nWe shall omit the consideration of the amount of credit given and the\r\nnumber of students enrolled in these courses until we have given\r\nattention to elective courses. Here the Sunday School Teacher Training\r\ncourses lead. They are composite courses in most instances. In other\r\nwords, they are elective courses, composed chiefly of sketches of\r\nchild psychology, the principles of teaching, school management, Old\r\nTestament History, New Testament History, geography of Bible lands and\r\nstory telling. These courses have become very popular in Negro\r\ncolleges during the last seven or eight years.\r\n\r\nDr. H.C. Lyman, Superintendent of the Negro work under the auspices of\r\nthe International Sunday School Association, has done incalculable\r\ngood in the way of encouraging this particular kind of work. The great\r\nmajority of these courses have been installed as a result of his\r\nendeavors. Only three of the 21 courses in these colleges have been\r\nestablished independently of his encouragement but in most instances\r\nby his formal installation. The following institutions offer as\r\nelectives courses in Sunday School management, organization and\r\nteaching: Atlanta University, Benedict College, Lane College, Claflin\r\nUniversity, Clark University, Fisk University, Howard University,\r\nLincoln University, Livingstone College, Morehouse College, Morgan\r\nCollege, New Orleans University, Roger Williams University, State\r\nUniversity, Swift Memorial College, Talladega College, Tillotson\r\nCollege, Wilberforce University, Spellman Seminary, and Morris Brown\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nSocial Ethics is elective in Virginia Union University, Morris Brown\r\nCollege, Fisk University, and Knoxville College. Social Service\r\ncourses are offered under the elective provision in several\r\ninstitutions. Seven of them offer these courses under their\r\ndepartments of sociology. They are: Atlanta University, Benedict\r\nCollege, Fisk University, Howard University, Morgan College, Talladega\r\nCollege, Virginia Union University and Wilberforce University.\r\n\r\nComparative Religion is offered at Talladega and Wilberforce. The\r\nPrinciples of Religious Education and the Organization of Religious\r\nEducation have been offered recently by Talladega and Fisk. Howard\r\nUniversity, Knoxville College and Morris Brown College offer in their\r\nelective systems New Testament Greek. The Bible is elective at Fisk,\r\nTillotson and Howard Universities. Mission Study is elective at\r\nTalladega College.\r\n\r\nHoward University has a wide range of electives covering a large scope\r\nof religious subjects which are offered in the School of Religion.\r\nThey are New Testament and Old Testament introduction courses,\r\nComparative Religion, Church History, Hebrew, Missions, the Teachings\r\nof Jesus, the Teachings of Paul, and New Testament biographical\r\ncourses. Wilberforce has a similar condition. They allow New Testament\r\nGreek, Hebrew, Social Service courses, the Life of Christ and the Life\r\nof Paul to count toward the Bachelor of Arts Degree. These courses,\r\nhowever, are all given in Payne Theological Seminary which is a part\r\nof the Wilberforce system.\r\n\r\nMorehouse College has a combination of the elective and prescribed\r\nsystem relative to the Bible. The English Bible is required in the\r\nFreshman year but elective in all of the other years. The following\r\nwill show the courses in religion which are offered in Negro colleges\r\nand will designate the number of institutions offering the several\r\ncourses as well as whether they are elective or prescribed.\r\n\r\n  Courses                                   Elective      Required\r\n\r\n   1.

In the 38\r\nprivate institutions for Negroes of college rank, which come under our\r\nobservation, there were enrolled for the scholastic year 1916-1917\r\ncollege students numbering 1,952. The numbers in the several colleges\r\nrun from 558 to 6. It is interesting to observe that over one-half of\r\nthat number was registered in four universities as follows: Howard\r\nUniversity, 558; Wilberforce University, 202; Fisk University, 208;\r\nand Lincoln University, 163. The total is 1,131. Of the remaining 821\r\nNegro college students over fifty per cent of them were distributed as\r\nfollows among these eight institutions: Talladega College, 66;\r\nVirginia Union University, 66; Morehouse College, 65; Benedict\r\nCollege, 60; Bishop College, 60; Atlanta University, 59; Shaw\r\nUniversity, 49; and Biddle University, 40. The total is 465. In these\r\ntwelve colleges and universities we have 1,596 students or over 75 per\r\ncent of the total for all of the 38 institutions.\r\n\r\nThe investigation shows that 1,104 of the 1,952 students are enrolled\r\nin these religious education courses. This is more than fifty per\r\ncent. In fact, it is 56 per cent of the total number enrolled. Making\r\na comparison of the same institutions which have the majority of\r\nstudents we note a difference in their proportion of students in\r\nreligious education to the total number enrolled. Howard University\r\nhas 98; Fisk 110; Lincoln 163; and Wilberforce 60. The total is 331,\r\nwhich is less than a third of the total number enrolled. Talladega has\r\n25; Virginia Union University 51; Shaw University 12; Benedict\r\nCollege 40; Bishop College 40. And the total is 262, which is\r\nconsiderably less than 50 per cent of the remaining 773. But when the\r\ntwelve schools are taken together they afford 53 per cent of the\r\nentire number enrolled in the courses of religious education in the 38\r\ncolleges and universities.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the amount of credit given for these religious\r\ncourses reveals facts as interesting as those relative to the number\r\ninfluenced by these courses. We have selected the unit to describe the\r\ncredit given. By unit we mean a course given 4 or 5 times a week for\r\n36 weeks. This is not intended to be technical. Most of these\r\ninstitutions have 45-minute periods. There are only four exceptions of\r\nwhich three have 60- and one 50-minute periods and a few 55-minute\r\nperiods. Their periods have been translated in terms of the 45-minute\r\nperiods for the sake of convenience. The units designate the amount of\r\ncredit given for both prescribed and elected courses. In the colleges\r\nwhere the elective system is extensive, the units represent the\r\nmaximum amount of credit which one may receive for courses in\r\nreligion. For an itemized description of the amount of credit given\r\nsee chart on last page.\r\n\r\nOnly one college of the 38 which we had under investigation offered no\r\ncredit for courses in Bible or correlated subjects. The other 37\r\noffered credit varying from one unit up to six units. Howard\r\nUniversity leads in the amount of units offered, and Knoxville\r\nCollege, Virginia Union and Lincoln contend for second place each\r\nhaving four and one-half units. Wilberforce takes third rank with four\r\nand one-fourth units. Texas College, one of the smallest in numbers,\r\nties Fisk University for the fourth place. The whole number of\r\ninstitutions investigated offer 85-1/2 units of credit for courses in\r\nreligious education.\r\n\r\nThe volunteer courses in colleges have been considered by many\r\nexceedingly efficacious for social and religious development. These\r\nvolunteer courses have various sources. In some few colleges they are\r\noffered by the faculty. But in the great majority of cases they come\r\nthrough the channels of the voluntary religious organizations of the\r\nrespective institutions. The Young Men's Christian Association and the\r\nYoung Women's Christian Association are the most active sources. The\r\nYoung People's Societies such as the Christian Endeavor and The\r\nEpworth League foster this project in a few of our Negro colleges but\r\nvery little data can be obtained therefrom, because they keep no\r\naccurate records from year to year.\r\n\r\nThere are thirty-six Young Men's Christian Associations in the\r\ncolleges comprising this study. All of the co-educational institutions\r\nand those for women especially have the Young Women's Christian\r\nAssociation. Therefore, we have thirty-six Young Men's Christian\r\nAssociations and thirty-six Young Women's Christian Associations in\r\nthese private colleges and universities. Fourteen institutions report\r\nBible study classes for men under the direction of students, more or\r\nless prepared. The membership in these classes is one hundred and\r\nseventy. Only five report Bible classes for women.\r\n\r\nMission study classes are also offered under the supervision of the\r\nAssociation in some of the colleges. The men in eleven colleges attend\r\nthe mission study classes and number three hundred nine. The women\r\nhave such provisions in two colleges with a membership of eighteen.\r\nThe numbers in these classes fluctuate from year to year depending\r\nlargely on two factors, the leaders of the respective association and\r\nthe leaders of the classes. The personnel of the student body is also\r\na factor. It is among the things natural that from time to time\r\nchanges in the personnel of the student body bring changes of interest\r\nand there is no guarantee of fixity so far as numbers are concerned.\r\nIt is the ideal of the Central Associations to have the classes\r\nsustained each year with an increased efficiency, but all of the\r\ninstitutions testify to the fluctuation caused by the human element in\r\nthe problem. These courses are mostly mapped out, even to the\r\nassigning of specific texts by accepted authors, by the International\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nTo what extent do religious services figure in this work? Worship has\r\nalways played an important part in the life of human beings. Whether\r\nman is in Babylonia worshipping the stars, or in Egypt at the\r\nIsis-Osiris shrine, or whether he ascends Mount Olympus with Homer, he\r\nis a worshipper. He may ascend to the indescribable, unthinkable\r\nrealms with Plotinus or he may with twentieth century enlightenment\r\nclaim allegiance to the God designated Father of all. Yet he worships.\r\nIt will prove interesting to note the stimulation of this instinct\r\nunder the supervision of the Negro colleges and universities.\r\n\r\nThe chapel services claim our attention first because it was\r\nunanimously denoted in the questionnaires as one of the services which\r\nthese institutions emphasize in the life of the students; many of them\r\npoint out its significance even for the teachers. Every one of these\r\ninstitutions require daily chapel attendance at a service, which lasts\r\non the average one-half hour among the thirty-eight institutions\r\ninvestigated. In nine-tenths of the announcements or bulletins sent\r\nfrom these institutions to prospective students, the chapel attendance\r\nis emphasized as one of the rigid requirements of the institutions. In\r\nfour-fifths of these same institutions, chapel attendance is recorded\r\nby some member of the faculty or some one deputized by the authority\r\nvested with that right.\r\n\r\nWhat value is the chapel service to the religious development? This\r\ncannot be answered indiscriminately. The answer depends upon the\r\nchapel activities. One should ask what happens at the chapel service.\r\nOne student answered that question thus: \"The chapel is the place\r\nwhere the president gets us all together to give us all a general\r\n'cussing out' instead of taking us one by one.\" This expresses the\r\nsentiment of several hundred students in those colleges included in\r\nour study. During this investigation I visited and had reports from 21\r\nchapel services. Out of the 21 investigated, 19 were exhibits of the\r\nopportune reprimand, with the president or his vice-president or the\r\ndean performing the task effectively. But it would be a gross\r\ninjustice even to the twenty-one institutions referred to, if we\r\nshould leave the impression that the sum total of chapel services is\r\ndescribed in the remarks relative to reprimands. A professor of one of\r\nthe leading Negro colleges, in defending the chapel service, said the\r\n\"calling down\" is merely the introduction and conclusion of the chapel\r\nexercises to give opportunity for ex-officio display.\r\n\r\nThere is obtaining in Negro institutions another condition which\r\nperhaps does not suffice as a legitimate excuse for the daily\r\nreprimand but at least explains it or is provocative of it. I have in\r\nmind the indiscriminate assembling of students from the high school or\r\npreparatory department and too often from the grammar school along\r\nwith the college students. Very often the official censor of morals\r\naims his remarks at some grammar school or high school character of\r\nnotoriety, but is democratic enough to include \"some of you students.\"\r\nThere are only two of these colleges of the entire 38 where the high\r\nschool students are separated from the college students for chapel\r\nservices. In all cases, except these two, they all assemble in the\r\nsame auditorium at the same time with the same privileges and under\r\nthe same circumstances. The most prominent index of distinction\r\nbetween a Junior college student and a Junior High School student in\r\nchapel is the locus of the seats.\r\n\r\nThe chapel exercises are led by the president, chaplain university\r\npastor, or some member of the faculty. Occasionally local and visiting\r\nministers are asked to serve in this capacity. Where the members of\r\nthe faculty lead they either come in their turn serving every morning,\r\nor whenever chapel services take place, until relieved by members of\r\nthe faculty who likewise serve for a designated period.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the service varies very slightly in these colleges and\r\nuniversities. One might readily get the impression that they all have\r\nthe same model. They all begin with religious music selected in most\r\ncases by the one who has the music of the institution under\r\nsupervision. Scripture reading or a brief moral, aesthetic, or ethical\r\naddress follows. Then prayer usually closing with the Lord's Prayer.\r\nIn seven of the institutions the scripture reading follows the prayer.\r\nA song usually closes the devotional period, but not the chapel\r\nexercises. It is subsequent to this song that the moral admonition\r\nundisguised usually follows. This is the time when visitors of\r\ndistinction and otherwise, entertain or detain the students.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the students has much to do with the religious value\r\nreceived from the chapel service. All of the authorities have\r\nestimated that their particular chapel services have excellent effects\r\nupon the students, judging from their attitude at chapel, which they\r\ndescribe as fair. They are confronted, however, with the problem not\r\nso easily solved in answering the question. It is extremely difficult\r\nfor them to distinguish just what part of that attitude comes from the\r\ninfluence of rules and regulations regarding chapel attendance and\r\nwhat part comes from choice.\r\n\r\nOne of the common religious agencies among Negro colleges is the\r\ncollege church. Twenty-nine of these colleges have church services\r\nevery Sunday, either morning, afternoon or evening. In twelve\r\ninstitutions they have preaching twice a day. All of them require\r\nattendance at church. The nine which have no preaching service at\r\ntheir places every Sunday have it occasionally and make up the deficit\r\nby requiring the students to attend a neighboring church, in most\r\ncases a church of the denomination under whose auspices the\r\ninstitution is operated. The students attending so far as the\r\nrequirements of the colleges are concerned are those who live in\r\ncollege dormitories. In no case has this requirement affected students\r\nliving in the community, beyond campus control. This means that the\r\nattendance at the college church aside from that given by those under\r\ndormitory supervision is voluntary. A large proportion of the\r\nstudents, therefore, attend other churches, the where and why of which\r\nis not known by the investigator. The proportion attending the college\r\nchurches, however, is ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe \"boarding\" students are the church goers so far as the college\r\nchurches are concerned. The number of college students living in the\r\ndormitories of these various institutions is 651 or just a fraction\r\nover one-third of the entire number enrolled in the thirty-eight\r\nprivate institutions. The other students, numbering 1,301, go whither\r\nthey please so far as the institutions are concerned, and no data as\r\nto the number attending the college church are available. In these\r\nchurches the pastors are usually the presidents or some other member\r\nof the faculty. In two instances the pastors are called chaplains and\r\nhave other religious functions during week days. In four cases, the\r\npastors and presidents are identical. This assures the college church\r\nwhich operates on the basis just stated, a good pastor. There are\r\neighteen which have these pastors. Eleven have no pastors or chaplains\r\nbut invite ministers of the city or neighboring cities to conduct\r\ntheir religious services on Sunday. This service is had at the time\r\nwhich is most convenient for pastors of local churches. The most\r\nfrequently used hour is from three or three-thirty to four-thirty or\r\nfive in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe established churches have prayer meeting during the week on one of\r\nthe following nights: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday. Just\r\nwhy Friday night is boycotted one is unable to say. The \"luck\"\r\npsychology may not have had any part in establishing the tradition\r\nalong that line. Here again we find the law of the \"Medes and\r\nPersians\" working effectively in securing corporeal attendance. The\r\nstudents are required to be there and are there in a body at least.\r\nThe times for convening these prayer meetings are chiefly two. Just\r\nafter supper in nine of the institutions and at the close of the\r\n\"study\" period in twenty-five. Four have the hours between seven and\r\neight o'clock in the evening or thereabouts.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday School is a prevalent religious agency among the Negro\r\ncolleges and universities. We find a Sunday School reported in\r\nthirty-seven of these. In these Sunday Schools the teachers who reside\r\nat the college dormitories constitute a part of the Sunday School\r\nfaculty. Some of the advanced students are used as teachers and\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of religious service prescribed by several colleges is\r\nthe Young People's Society. They are all of the same general nature.\r\nThey take different names such as the Epworth League, The Baptist\r\nYoung People's Union, the Allen Christian Endeavor and so forth,\r\ndepending in the main upon their denominational affiliation. Thirty\r\ncolleges expect their boarding students to be present at these\r\nmeetings. These thirty institutions have 388 students of college rank\r\nliving in the dormitories of these respective institutions. Thus three\r\nhundred eighty-eight students attend these Sunday afternoon or Sunday\r\nevening meetings.\r\n\r\nFive colleges which are co-educational have the \"quiet\" hour for girls\r\non Sunday afternoon. It was designed to be religious or semi-religious\r\nat least. Each girl goes to her room and remains there quiet for a\r\ndesignated period of time. During this time she is expected to read\r\nher Bible or some religious book, or engage in some meditation which\r\nis in keeping with the holy day. Where this idea originated, the\r\nwriter is unable to say. He, with those who have observed this\r\nmystical quiet hour, is puzzled concerning its religious efficacy. One\r\nnaturally asked those in authority why not a \"quiet\" hour for the boys\r\nas well. There seems to be either a very high compliment paid to the\r\nboys or quite an unpardonable insinuation on the inherited tendencies\r\nof the girls.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the Sunday services and the Sunday School is evident\r\nwithout further elaboration. Perhaps a more detailed description of\r\nthe prayer meeting and the Young People's meeting is in order. A\r\ncommon element is seen in the prayer meetings, \"sentence prayers\" and\r\nsinging. Several students think I should add a third, namely,\r\nsleeping. Another very frequent activity is the testimony of religious\r\nachievements, disappointments and hopes. Eleven colleges have topics\r\nwhich are posted each week prior to the meeting. These topics are\r\nreligious in the orthodox sense but three of the eleven have pushed\r\nfar away from the shore of orthodoxy and discuss current topics of\r\nvital interest. In these three institutions the meeting re-resembles a\r\nforum where every one expresses his opinion, and exhausts his energy\r\non favorite themes. The Young People's meetings without exception,\r\naccording to reports, have two common phases. The first is the study\r\nand discussion of the specified topics, accompanied of course with\r\nmusic and prayers. This might be called the devotional phase of the\r\nmeeting. Then there is a change in program, in which the literary side\r\nis given precedent. Music of a classical nature constitutes the\r\nfeature of the program.\r\n\r\nOne of the all important interrogations in this connection is the\r\nfeeling of the students concerning these religious organizations\r\nmentioned. Do they function in the lives of the students? Do they feel\r\nthat these organizations are vital to them or do they feel as one\r\nstudent in an eastern university? When interviewed he said: \"Oh, well,\r\nI guess they are pretty good. I suppose they are among the necessary\r\nevils of college life.\"\r\n\r\nAn extensive interview of the students at seven institutions revealed\r\nsome interesting facts. The presidents or deans from the thirty-eight\r\ncolleges gave some data and much opinion on the benefits which the\r\nstudents derived from these organizations, according to the students\r\ntestimonies and the observation of these presidents or deans. I am not\r\ninclined to place too much emphasis upon the students' testimony to\r\nthe presidents, because, the psychological situation of a student who\r\nis asked by a college president what he thinks of the church service,\r\nSunday School and Epworth League is not conducive to frankness. This\r\nis especially true of students who know what the president wants him\r\nto say. It is a sort of begging the question. The average college\r\nstudent is apt to have too much respect for the president's feelings\r\nto be frank in such a case. He likewise has a keen sense of\r\nself-preservation. He does not want to incur the displeasure of the\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nIn the case of five other institutions, therefore, I had students, Y.\r\nM. C. A. workers, interview the leaders of various activities in these\r\ncolleges with a view to getting their candid opinion and the\r\nreflection of the opinion of the other students. In these various ways\r\nwe secured data which represented a high degree of probability to say\r\nthe least. Ninety-five per cent of the students in Negro colleges\r\nreckon the church service on Sunday a beneficial agency for religious\r\nfunctioning. They vary greatly as to the degree of good derived. In\r\neleven institutions the singing and liturgy are placed first in the\r\nrank of importance and the prayer last. These same colleges think the\r\nsermon takes second place. By many of this same number congregational\r\nsinging is given a very high place. The general complaint against the\r\nsermon is that it is too dry. I think what is meant by this is that\r\nthe sermon lacks enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThere may be two reasons for the impression of the dryness of the\r\nsermon, if the complaint is justified. In the first place, a large\r\nnumber of the college pastors begin their sermons on the assumption\r\nthat a student's religious life is essentially different from that of\r\nthe average person in a congregation eight blocks away in another\r\nchurch, a matter which cannot always be taken for granted. That\r\nassumption conditions his sermons in character of composition and\r\nespecially in delivery. The minister works on the assumption that the\r\ncollege man will be interested and benefited by science, philosophy\r\nand so forth, regardless of how it is presented. In the reaction\r\nagainst excessive emotion he too often swings to the other extreme.\r\n\r\nAgain the college students in these universities have come from such a\r\nvariety of environments. It would be a safe estimate to say that in\r\nall Negro colleges 90 per cent of the students are Baptist and\r\nMethodists. The registrar's records from these 38 organizations show\r\nthe following: 983 Baptists; 790 Methodists; and 179 divided among the\r\nother denominations. This gives the Baptist and Methodists 90.8 per\r\ncent of the total enrollment in these 38 institutions. This means then\r\nthat 90.8 per cent of these students have had a Baptist-Methodist\r\nenvironment for eighteen or twenty years. Well, what does that matter\r\nso far as the estimate of the value of sermons delivered to them? It\r\nmeans that, at least, it is not likely that the impression through\r\nchildhood, youth, and young manhood or womanhood will be easily offset\r\nby the college religious environment in one, two, three or four years.\r\nIdeals theoretical, of course, change remarkably, but inevitably some\r\nelements of satisfaction afforded by the earlier environment will be\r\ndemanded in the college environment by the students. Then the\r\nBaptist-Methodist environment among the Negroes is, if anything at\r\nall, an enthusiastic environment. The sermon is one of the conspicuous\r\nfeatures. A student affected by such an environment does not\r\nnecessarily demand all of the crudities but he does not like the swing\r\nto the other extreme.\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of students and teachers that the Sunday School is\r\nbeneficial. From answers received it is calculated that 98 per cent of\r\nall the college students believe in the Sunday School's beneficent\r\ninfluence in student life. Several included in their remarks criticism\r\nof the literature used. The same beneficent functioning was attested\r\nto in behalf of the Young People's meetings, but the hammer falls\r\nheavily on the mid-week prayer meeting, out of which very few see any\r\ngood come. One dubs \"the prayer meeting, the driest, deadest event,\r\nwhich takes place just at the time when it is most difficult to be\r\ninterested in such.\" Many other similar expressions concerning the\r\nprayer meetings were made. It was noted, however, that the schools\r\nwhich had been diverged the fartherest from the traditional prayer\r\nmeeting had the most good to say in behalf of the prayer meeting. In\r\nthe great majority of instances the opinion is that the prayer meeting\r\nis a bore and should be abandoned. A student in one of the southern\r\ncolleges, expressing what he had reasons for believing was the\r\nstudent's attitude towards prayer meetings, said: \"It isn't\r\ninteresting and isn't even a good sleeping place because one cannot\r\nstretch out as he desires.\"\r\n\r\nThe general attitude towards the services on Sunday, however, is\r\nfavorable. These services are considered beneficial. The students\r\nfeel that they are moral and religious supports, and in all cases they\r\nbelieve with slight modifications that these services could be more\r\neffective. A great premium is placed upon congregational singing and\r\nthe liturgy in the services.\r\n\r\nThe week of prayer for colleges has become in these institutions as\r\nuniversal as the national holidays. This occasion affects the regular\r\nroutine of school work in 22 colleges and universities. It is\r\nconducted variously. In some colleges the effort consists of a series\r\nof prayer and song services offering opportunity to those who have not\r\nmade a decision for the better life to do so openly. Their names are\r\nrecorded, and they become members of the college church, where there\r\nis one. Otherwise they are provided for through other means. Those who\r\nfail to make decisions are made special objects of moral and religious\r\nendeavor during the following months. In the other cases of 18\r\ncolleges, a religious survey is made of the student body, usually\r\nthrough the Young Men's Christian Association and the Young Women's\r\nChristian Association. This survey is made sometimes prior to the week\r\nof prayer and personal workers are selected to do campaign work which\r\nis to culminate in decisions during the week of prayer. The week of\r\nprayer service is conducted by the president, college pastor, or\r\nchaplain usually assisted by the members of the divinity school where\r\nthere is one connected with the institution. Nine colleges have this\r\nconvocation led by some strong minister from the community. Four\r\nsurrender the entire task to a professional evangelist.\r\n\r\nThe students and officials of these colleges report some very\r\nsignificant results and all of them are agreed in this: the week of\r\nprayer is a very valuable harvester for gathering the fruits of\r\nprevious endeavor, as well as a decision promoter itself. There is no\r\nunanimity of opinion relative to the best way of conducting the week\r\nof prayer, except that the method will vary with conditions. Eight\r\ncollege pastors and chaplains declare it injurious in the long run to\r\nhave professional evangelists. The others except four did not know,\r\nas they had never given the evangelist a test. They were at least\r\ndubious about making the experiment.\r\n\r\nSome of the results reported from the week of prayer are as follows:\r\nFor the scholastic year 1916-1917 there resulted 322 confessions for\r\nthe better life. The most of these were followed by what the\r\npresidents of these colleges denominated religious growth. In these\r\ncolleges there were, prior to the week of prayer, 390 confessors. This\r\nmeans then that subsequent to the week of prayer 68 non-confessors\r\nremained among the college men and women. This shows also that prior\r\nto the week of prayer one-fifth of a student body of 1,952 were\r\nnon-confessors. The week of prayer was the occasion of transforming\r\n82.5 per cent of that one-fifth into confessors. The Negro colleges\r\nsubsequent to the week of prayer 1916-1917, therefore, were 96.5 per\r\ncent Christian as a result of the week of prayer, in part at least.\r\nJust how much the personal work, the Christian environment and other\r\nfactors during other times prior to the week of prayer played is\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will suffice to state that each of these colleges has\r\nmorning devotions every day at the breakfast hour. They are very\r\nterse, consisting chiefly of the Lord's Prayer or a blessing sung or\r\nrecited. Seventeen have night devotions closing the study hour except\r\non the night appointed for the weekly prayer meeting. The benefit of\r\nthe dining-room is not easily detected. The enthusiasm often\r\nmanifested may be due to anxiety to dine. The interest due to that\r\ndesire, and that due to the religious stimuli, then and thereafter are\r\nnot easily distinguished one from the other.\r\n\r\nVoluntary religious services are conducted under the auspices of the\r\nreligious organizations in the colleges and universities. These\r\norganizations present quite a variety in name. But most of them are\r\nvery similar in function. Some of the organizations which are included\r\nin the study of required religious services will be given space under\r\nthis topic because while they are required in some colleges, they are\r\nvoluntary in others. The organizations are the Young Men's Christian\r\nAssociation, the Young Women's Christian Association, Missionary\r\nSocieties, Temperance Societies, The Student Volunteer Movement, the\r\nCircle of King's Daughters, the White Cross League, and Young People's\r\nSocieties of Endeavor.\r\n\r\nThe Young Men's Christian Association is the most popular among the\r\nmen of the institutions, and the Young Women's Christian Association\r\nis the choice of the women. The reasons for this situation is fairly\r\nobvious. In the first place, the Young Men's and Young Women's\r\nChristian Associations have been stimulated more by the international\r\nAssociations than any other similar parent organization has stimulated\r\nits offspring. There is a continuous program, and alert men whose\r\nbusiness it is to see that these associations go. They are paid good\r\nsalaries for that purpose. Then the very fact that the Y. M. C. A. is\r\ninternational in scope and system has its bearing upon the local\r\nbranches in the various colleges. What has been asserted concerning\r\nthe Y. M. C. A. might likewise be said about the Y. W. C. A.\r\n\r\nThere is, no doubt, another reason explanatory of the popularity of\r\nthese associations. Those who are in authority in the international\r\nAssociation have studied student life with an eye single to meeting\r\nthe needs of men and women so environed. Perhaps then, these\r\norganizations appeal more to men and women than the others. In\r\n1916-1917 these colleges had enrolled in the Y. M. C. A. and the Y. W.\r\nC. A. 1,252 students. They estimated an average attendance at their\r\nSunday meetings of 940, including men and women. These meetings are\r\nabout an hour long. One feature which the men respond to very readily,\r\naccording to the reports, is the participation in the discussion of\r\nthe topic after a leader has opened it. There is, however, an evident\r\nlack of accurate records of the effect of these services upon the\r\nstudent life in these institutions. Howard University, Fisk and\r\nTalladega Colleges have made the most progress along this line.\r\n\r\nEleven colleges reported temperance societies which have occasional\r\nservices. These are Lane College, Fisk University, Howard University,\r\nConroe College, Edward Waters College, Livingstone College, New\r\nOrleans University, Texas College, Roger Williams University, Samuel\r\nHouston College, and Shaw University. Wilberforce and Benedict have\r\nstudent Volunteer services.\r\n\r\nThe following twelve institutions have missionary societies holding\r\nservices fortnightly: Howard University, Morgan College, Morris Brown\r\nCollege, New Orleans University, Rust College, Samuel Houston College,\r\nShaw University, Swift Memorial College, Virginia Union University,\r\nWilberforce University, Spellman Seminary and Virgina Theological\r\nSeminary and College.\r\n\r\nEight of the thirty-eight colleges under consideration encourage the\r\nYoung People's Sunday evening meetings but they have not made\r\nattendance compulsory believing, they say, that there should be some\r\nopportunity for choice in respect to attending some of these meetings.\r\nThey report a large attendance and think that compulsion would add\r\nvery little to the attendance and detract perhaps from the\r\neffectiveness of such meetings. Why this point of view does not hold\r\ntrue in respect to the Sunday school which is required by these same\r\ninstitutions one is at a loss to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPRESSIONAL ACTIVITIES OF THE NEGRO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\r\n\r\nWe have investigated the knowledge of religious education derived from\r\nreligious education courses in the curricula of thirty-eight colleges\r\nas well as those offered by voluntary associations. We have likewise\r\nreviewed the preparation of the teachers of these courses, the time\r\ngiven to the teaching of them, the attitude of the teachers towards\r\nthe work, and the character and amount of worship given by these\r\nstudents. It now remains for us to examine the expressional activities\r\nof these students. What opportunity have they for the expression of\r\ntheir religious thought and devotional attitude in actual service? The\r\nmeans to that end are not to be viewed lightly, if the education\r\nprinciple, no impression without expression, is worth anything in the\r\nprocess of religious growth. The religious laboratories must be as\r\nvital for the students, as the chemical or biological laboratory.\r\n\r\n35 of these schools report Sunday School work of some kind for 360\r\nstudents. This work is of the general kinds. There are many who teach\r\nin the College Sunday Schools. 187 teach in Mission Sunday Schools in\r\nthe vicinity of the college. 400 teach vacation Sunday Schools in the\r\nvarious localities to which they go during the summer vacation. These\r\n360 students doing Sunday School work during the scholastic year are\r\ndistributed among 23 institutions. There is a likelihood of more\r\ncolleges furnishing teachers for this work but they have not reported\r\nit because they keep no record of that work. The schools reporting\r\nare: Allen University, Atlanta University, Clark University, Spellman\r\nSeminary, Morehouse College, Morris Brown College, Howard University,\r\nFisk University, Lincoln University, Edward Water's College, Lane\r\nCollege, Claflin University, Conroe College, Benedict College,\r\nLivingstone College, Morgan College, Roger William University, Shaw\r\nUniversity, Virginia Union University, Tougaloo University, Talladega\r\nCollege, Wilberforce University, and Rust College. Fisk University and\r\nVirginia Union conduct mission Sunday Schools. They seem to have\r\nunique places relative to the Sunday School service.\r\n\r\nBoys Clubs are not numerous among the activities participated in by\r\nthe Negro college students. Only four report such an organization.\r\nWilberforce has a local Boy's Scout Club conducted under the auspices\r\nof the Young Men's Christian Association. Howard University, Fisk\r\nUniversity and Morehouse College conduct boys clubs and some of the\r\nmen find excellent opportunity for service. The following make visits\r\nto prisons and render the inmates service: Knoxville College, Benedict\r\nCollege, Virginia Union University, Atlanta University, and Morris\r\nBrown College.\r\n\r\nThere are several institutions that minister to the poor and\r\ndependents through the various voluntary organizations. Wilberforce\r\ndistributes a limited number of Bibles, and other necessities to the\r\ncommunity in which it is situated. It does this through the Young\r\nWomen's Christian Association. Morgan College, Fisk University, Morris\r\nBrown College, Benedict College, Morehouse College, Edward Waters\r\nCollege, Virginia Union, Talladega College, and Biddle University do\r\nsimilar work for the poor.\r\n\r\nThe colleges and universities rendering other social service such as\r\nwork among the boys at the reform schools, visiting and ministering to\r\norphans, assisting at Old Folk's homes and asylums, are Fisk\r\nUniversity, Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morgan College,\r\nHoward University, Talladega College, Virginia Union University, Shaw\r\nUniversity, Biddle University, Allen University, and Bishop\r\nCollege.[2] Fisk University has a university settlement house, the\r\nBethlehem House, which operates under the social science department.\r\nThis affords the Fisk students a splendid opportunity to serve society\r\nat first hand.\r\n\r\nAll of the thirty-eight colleges and universities give opportunity for\r\nservice in the college churches or in the churches where the college\r\nworship. All have some students serving in the choirs. In the\r\nchurches, which are college churches in the real sense of the work,\r\nthat is, regularly organized with pastor and officers the students are\r\nlargely the officers. Thirty college presidents think this is splendid\r\nexpressional activity.\r\n\r\nFive institutions use their missionary societies to help support some\r\none whom they know on the foreign mission field. The other seven\r\nreporting organized missionary societies all have what might be called\r\nforeign mission rallies and give the proceeds to that work. In the\r\nmost of these cases, the money goes to the foreign field through\r\ndenominational channels.\r\n\r\nService in the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A. as chairman and members of\r\ncommittees gives a small number opportunity for expressional activity\r\nof a kind. The same may be said for the other voluntary organizations.\r\n\r\nThe financing of religious education in these colleges is significant.\r\nQuestion number fourteen in the general questionnaire is: _Does your\r\ncollege have a special appropriation for religious work, viz, for the\r\nY. M. C. A., for Chaplain, College Pastor and so forth?_ All of these\r\ninstitutions except four answered this question in the negative.\r\nMorgan College has an appropriation for the chaplain and special\r\nappropriation for a teacher of Bible. Fisk University and Lincoln have\r\nBible chairs endowed. Howard University has special appropriations for\r\nthe Y. M. C. A. Tougaloo has a part of the college pastor's salary\r\nappropriated by the American Missionary Association. The others have\r\nno appropriation which pertains to the special religious work. This\r\nmeans that the religious work in these colleges has a decided\r\nfinancial handicap of which they are all very conscious. The special\r\nwork is financed by subscriptions, funds raised by entertainments, and\r\nthe donations of the students and teachers. This means a fluctuation\r\nfrom time to time depending upon the generosity of the donors. An\r\nendeavor to secure funds to carry out the programs of these voluntary\r\norganizations usurps much of the time and energy of those who lead\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN STATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\r\n\r\nThis study embraces the following State institutions offering complete\r\ncollege curricula or doing college grade of work: Florida Agricultural\r\nand Mechanical College, Georgia State College for Colored Youths,\r\nAlcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, Alabama Agricultural and\r\nMechanical College, Agricultural and Technical College of North\r\nCarolina, and the West Virginia Collegiate Institute.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of religion in none of these institutions are\r\nprofessionally trained. They are usually laymen who are teaching in\r\nthe other departments of the institution. The time given varies but\r\naverages fifty-five minutes per week each. Their attitude toward the\r\nsubject of religious education is optimistic. The very fact that all\r\nof them are volunteers save three shows that there is an interest in\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\nFour State colleges offer Teacher Training courses but they are all\r\nelective as might be expected since they are State colleges. In all\r\ncases these colleges would have to make the most of these courses\r\nelective in order to avoid a conflict with State constitutions. Note,\r\nhowever, that Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College offer\r\ncourses in social service, which are required. Of the 325 college\r\nstudents enrolled in these six State institutions 165 of these are\r\nenrolled in the religious education courses. This is more than\r\none-third of the entire number, a larger proportion than in the\r\nprivate institutions.\r\n\r\nThe State colleges have voluntary religious organizations, but none of\r\nthe conductors are professionally trained. These courses are of the\r\nsame type as those found in the private institutions, except for the\r\ndenominational features. The Young Men's Christian Association, the\r\nYoung Women's Christian Association and the Temperance Clubs are those\r\nfound in these institutions and there are enrolled for this work 213\r\nmen and women.\r\n\r\nAlcorn A. and M. College has five men in the mission study class and\r\nfive in the Bible study class. Florida A. and M. College has eight in\r\nthe Bible study class and three in the mission study. The Georgia\r\nState College has twenty in the Bible and the Alabama Agricultural and\r\nMechanical College sixteen. The Agricultural and Technical College of\r\nGreensboro, North Carolina, reports none in the Bible and mission\r\nstudy classes.\r\n\r\nReligious services are not foreign to the State institutions for\r\nNegroes. They are the daily chapel exercises, Sunday morning\r\npreaching, Sunday School, Sunday afternoon or evening services, and\r\nthe weekly prayer meeting. The chapel exercises are made compulsory\r\nfor the students. The nature of the service is very much like that in\r\nthe denominational and private institutions described above.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday services are as conspicuous in these State colleges for\r\nNegroes as they are in the private and denominational institutions.\r\nAttendance is required by every one of the State institutions being\r\nconsidered. Two of these have chaplains: the Agricultural and\r\nMechanical College of Alabama and Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical\r\nCollege of Mississippi. In two instances the students attend\r\nneighboring churches and have preachers from the outside to minister\r\nunto them. Sunday School is conducted at each of the State colleges\r\nand attendance is required. Each has on Sunday evening some kind of\r\nmeeting which the students are required to attend.\r\n\r\nThe prayer meeting in Negro colleges, State as well as private and\r\ndenominational, is a permanent organization. Each of these State\r\ncolleges report that the students are required to attend the prayer\r\nmeeting. As there are 187 boarding students in the State colleges of\r\ncollege rank, this means a fair attendance at Sunday services and\r\nprayer in these institutions. The other 188 attend service\r\npromiscuously.\r\n\r\nThe week of prayer for colleges is observed by all, and all regard it\r\na valuable asset to the religious life of their student bodies. In\r\n1916-1917 prior to the week of prayer 119 of the 325 students of\r\ncollege rank enrolled in these State colleges were not professed\r\nChristians. Subsequent to the week of prayer 24 of the one hundred\r\nnineteen were left. Thus before the week of prayer there was 63.3 per\r\ncent professed Christians. The week of prayer was instrumental in\r\nreducing the percentage of non-confessors. After the week of prayer\r\n92.6 per cent of all of the students were professors of Christianity.\r\n\r\nHere as in the other institutions the morning and evening devotions\r\nare daily for terse periods. They precede breakfast, in the dining\r\nhalls and at the close of the study periods. The services of the Y. M.\r\nC. A., the Y. W. C. A., and the temperance societies are very much\r\nlike the services of these organizations in the denominational and\r\nprivate colleges and universities. The students in State colleges have\r\nfeelings similar to those in private colleges about religious\r\nservices. Very few are defenders of the weekly prayer meetings.\r\n\r\nExpressional activities at State colleges are not wanting. The six\r\ncolleges report service rendered in the college church and voluntary\r\nreligious organizations. Seventy-seven teach Sunday School. Five of\r\nthese colleges are situated in the rural districts and there are\r\nstudents who serve the rural communities in church work. All of them\r\ndo some extension work of a religious nature. Periodically the\r\nstudents are sent out to investigate conditions among the poor and to\r\noffer services to relieve these conditions. Under this social service\r\nare lectures and demonstrations portraying ideals which are genuinely\r\nreligious. The great majority of the students of college grade are\r\nassistants to the professors in this work. Five do special social\r\nservice work during three holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New\r\nYear's Day. They take food, fuel, clothes and money to the needy of\r\ntheir communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONCEPTION OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN NEGRO COLLEGES\r\n\r\nAn exhaustive psychological analysis of the conception of religious\r\neducation is not the aim of this part of the study. But from certain\r\ndata which has come out of the study one is able to obtain ideas\r\nconcerning the view of the educators on the aim of religious education\r\nand the degree in which this aim is being attained. We note in the\r\nfirst place that all of those who answered the questionnaires were\r\ncognizant of the religious motives in education. Perhaps a few typical\r\nquotations will emphasize that. \"I think much personal good is done.\r\nThe student gets a clearer idea of the Bible and its value in the\r\nworld today.\" \"I regard the course in religion as vital and essential\r\nto any thorough education.\" \"The religious value of the course given\r\nis inestimable.\" \"The religious training through these courses gives\r\neducation the impetus which pushes it on to its goal.\" \"The religious\r\ncourses are regarded as valuable adjuncts to the educational\r\ninstitutions.\" \"I have abundant data from graduates of this\r\ninstitution and other individuals of our constituency confirming our\r\nopinion of the abiding gains for character and efficiency through the\r\ninfluence of these courses and their expression in service.\"\r\n\"Experience is the basis of the conclusion that the religious work in\r\nthe colleges gives sympathetic training for efficient service. More\r\nattention must be given to our curricula in this respect.\" \"The\r\nstudents who are most exemplary in worthwhile endeavor are prominent\r\nin these courses and organizations.\" \"I have a high estimate of the\r\nactual work done by these students and of the development of their own\r\ncharacter.\"\r\n\r\nAn examination of the statements concerning the religious aims and\r\nprivileges published in the catalogues of these schools show that,\r\ntheoretically at least, they have begun their task in directing the\r\neducative process with a consciousness of the choice place of moral\r\nand spiritual culture in the task. To illustrate, let us note the\r\nfollowing: \"The aim of all the religious work in our institution is to\r\nbuild up a strong Christian character, to develop the spirit of\r\nservice, and to train in the methods and the habit of religious work.\"\r\n\"This work aims at teaching colored young people how to want the best\r\nthings in life, and at training them in ability to get those things by\r\nskill of hand and power of mind. Character and efficiency are thus the\r\ntwin essentials of the ideal. It would enable its pupils to make a\r\nsufficient living, teach them to live efficient lives, and inspire\r\nthem to render society sufficient service. To hold such an aim\r\nthoroughgoingly is to be positively Christian.\" \"To all who are\r\ninclined to respect the Christian religion and its institutions, the\r\nwelcome hand will be heartily extended; but to those whose influence\r\nwill be prejudicial to religion and good morals, no protracted stay\r\ncan be allowed; since the success of an educational institution is\r\nstrictly proportional to its moral tone.\" \"Self-mastery, symmetrical\r\ncharacter, high ideals and purposes are regarded as the chief ends of\r\neducation. Special attention is given to the spiritual needs of the\r\nstudents. In the life and discipline of the school, constant effort is\r\nmade to inculcate Christian principles.\" These are some of the typical\r\nstatements published in catalogues, announcements and in other college\r\nadvertising media.\r\n\r\nOne will note that although the great majority of these colleges and\r\nuniversities are sectarian they have refrained, theoretically at\r\nleast, from obtruding sectarianism in the religious education. They\r\nhave made sectarianism take at least a secondary place. This is\r\nfurther strengthened by the fact that there are in these\r\ndenominational schools 36 Catholics who apparently have met no\r\noffensive media of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe results justify the following statement concerning the conception\r\nof religious education in Negro colleges and universities: They\r\nconceive religious education to be no quantum of doctrine but a life\r\nlived efficiently, being animated by the social service motive. Thus\r\nreligious education is social evolution, and ninety-nine per cent of\r\nthose in charge of these institutions have conceptions of religious\r\neducation becoming more efficient than it now is. As proof of this, I\r\nmay cite the results of their answers to question; fifteen in the\r\ngeneral questionnaire. This question is: \"_In your opinion are the\r\nNegro colleges meeting the needs of definite religious training?_\"\r\nEvery one's answer except one might be summarized thus: Some good has\r\nbeen accomplished but we are far from the real goal. We need\r\nreconstruction and a new impetus.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis which they are putting on expressional activity as an\r\nessential in the process of religious education does seem to indicate\r\nthat they regard self activity. Wherever the social service was very\r\nscant the one reporting felt it his duty to give an apology for the\r\nactual conditions and express a hope of better results in the future.\r\nThis showed that they felt it the vital factor in the progressive\r\nsocialization of the individuals. The place of prominence given to\r\nworship, to religious services on Sunday and in the week is either an\r\nindex to their conception concerning the value of worship or else an\r\nindex of their habit toward orthodoxy. Circumstances surrounding these\r\nschools would suggest the former for the larger number of these\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME CURRENT CONCEPTIONS OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN RELATION TO GENERAL\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nReligious education is considered a part of general education and is\r\nincluded under that genus. What is general education? For a long time\r\neducation was defined in terms of intellect, but that ground is no\r\nlonger tenable. Spencer said: \"Education is the preparation for\r\ncomplete living.\" Modern educators reject this as an inadequate\r\nstatement of education. Education does not merely prepare for\r\nsomething in the future. It endeavors to fill one full of life, and\r\nhuman experience during the educative process. Education must be\r\nexpressed in social terms. James describes education as the\r\norganization of acquired habits of conduct and tendencies to behavior.\r\nThis emphasizes the psychological side.\r\n\r\nIt was thought that the aim of education could be expressed in purely\r\nindividual terms. It was said to be the harmonious development of all\r\nthe powers of the individual. Dewey attacks this definition showing\r\nthat there is no criterion for telling what is meant by the terms\r\nused. We do not know what a power is; we do not know what is meant by\r\ndevelopment or harmony. A power is a power with reference to the use\r\nto which it is put, the function it has to serve. There is nothing in\r\nthe make-up of human beings, taken in any isolated way which furnishes\r\ncontrolling ends and serves to mark out powers. Unless we have the aim\r\nsupplied by social life we have only the old faculty psychology to\r\nfurnish us with ideas of powers in general or the specific powers.[3]\r\nDewey defines education as the regulation of the process of coining\r\nto share in the social consciousness. And the majority of educators\r\nuse social terms to define education. Soares has this conception in\r\nmind when he gives the following definition of education. \"Education\r\nis a scientifically directed process of developing progressive\r\nsocialized personality.\" But to achieve personality one must achieve\r\nsympathy and sympathy is one of the concerns of religion. Hence all\r\ntrue education involves religion.\r\n\r\nWhat is religion? Wright in the _American Journal of Theology_, Volume\r\nXVI, page 385, quotes Leuba as defining religion as a belief in a\r\npsychic superhuman power. Wright has objections to this definition on\r\nthe ground of its narrowness. He attempts to add breadth to the\r\ndefinition in: \"Religion is the endeavor to secure the conservation of\r\nsocially recognized values, through specific actions that are believed\r\nto evoke some agency different from the ordinary ego of the individual\r\nor from other merely human beings, and that imply a feeling of\r\ndependence upon this agency. Religion is the social attitude toward\r\nthe non-human environment.\" This is not synonymous with sectarianism,\r\ncreeds, dogmas or ceremonies. Creeds and ceremonies have to do with\r\necclesiasticism not with religion per se. Creeds are developments of\r\ntheology and dogma is an outgrowth of religion and not religion. Modes\r\nof worship developed into rites and ceremonies are ecclesiastical\r\nmeans of fostering the religious spirit but not religion. Religion is\r\nnot a feeling to be imposed from without. Religion is a life and a\r\nlife-long process. \"The religious life is the response the heart of\r\nman makes to God, as the heart of the universe. The religious person\r\nis one who is conscious of his divinity because of his kinship with\r\nthe universe through God, and who because of this consciousness seeks\r\nfellowship with God and the Godly.\"\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at the conclusion concerning education and religion\r\nwhich are given by some of the most representative students of the\r\nsubjects, let us ascertain some conceptions of religious education. As\r\nindicated in the beginning of this topic, religious education is not\r\nregarded as a separate entity. It is a part of the process of\r\nefficient education. The human organism is a unit. Life is a whole and\r\nconnects physical, mental and religious phases. The whole personality\r\nis the object for consideration for the educator. The emphasis in\r\neducation varies from physical to mental and from mental to religious,\r\nor social. When the emphasis is placed on the social or religious\r\nphase the procedure may be properly called religious education.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hartshorn carries the social idea to an adequate conclusion.\r\nHe says: \"Religious education is the process by which the individual\r\nin response to a controlled environment, achieves a progressive,\r\nconscious social[4] order based on regard for the worth and destiny of\r\nevery individual.\" Professor Peabody states the matter in the\r\nfollowing words:[5] \"Religious education is the drawing out of the\r\nreligious nature, the clarifying and strengthening of religious\r\nideals, the enriching and rationalizing of the sense of God.... The\r\nend of religious education is service....\" Dewey's idea of education\r\nis much akin to the current conceptions of religious education. \"The\r\nmoral trinity of the school is social intelligence, social power and\r\nsocial interests. Our resources are, (1) the life of the school as a\r\nsocial institution in itself, (2) methods of learning and doing work,\r\nand (3) the curriculum.\"[6]\r\n\r\nThe goal of general and religious education is the same; namely, the\r\ngetting of the individual into the highest and most desirable\r\nrelationship with both the human and non-human elements, in his\r\nenvironment. The standard of each is found in the functional\r\nrelationship of each to society. Modes of expression and emphasis may\r\nvary but the ideals for both are the same. Dr. Haslett[7] has given an\r\nunique representation of this conception. \"Religious education,\" says\r\nhe, \"is closely related to secular education and is largely dependent\r\nupon it. The fundamental laws and principles of psychology and of\r\neducation require to be recognized as central.\" Professor Coe[8]\r\nreminds us, however, that \"religious education is not and cannot be a\r\nmere application of any generalities in which the university\r\ndepartments of education deal. It is not a mere particular that gets\r\nits meaning or finds its test in the general.\" Religious education\r\ndeals with original data and with specific problems that rarely appear\r\nin the instruction that is called 'general' and that grow out of the\r\nspecific nature of our educational purpose. In the analysis of these\r\ndata and in the determination of the method, we can and must use\r\nmatter contained in general courses of education. But the field of\r\nstudy of religious education is not exhausted there, but is so\r\nspecific and yet so broad as properly to constitute a recognized\r\nbranch of educational practice. The religious purpose in religious\r\neducation yields the point of view and the principles of\r\nclassification that are important for religious educators.\r\n\r\nThe conceptions of religious education just passed in review warrant\r\ncertain deductions. Any institution which meets adequately the\r\nrequirements of religious education must have genuinely religious men\r\nand women in the entire teaching and official force. Such persons will\r\ndetermine the atmosphere and spirit of the institution. These teachers\r\nshould have clear conceptions of the ideals of religious education.\r\nThe blind cannot lead the blind. The students must be trained along\r\nthree fundamental lines, of the religious life. First, he must have\r\nsome of the intellectual value of religion. He must have social\r\nknowledge. He must have the opportunity of expressing the devotional\r\nattitude in worship. He must have the outlet of religious energy in\r\nsocial service. The duty of the college will be far from discharged\r\nunless it makes provision for laboratory religion where there is a\r\nworking place for each member. Religion is a life and the college\r\nshould be a society where this life may be lived in its fullest\r\nextent, encouraging practical altruism and giving the protection which\r\nan ideal society affords against demoralization.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN NEGRO COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES\r\n\r\nThe problem of religious education in Negro institutions is real. On\r\nthe basis of the investigation we are able to point out some prominent\r\nphases of the problem. The first element of this problem is the\r\nteacher. There are in Negro colleges, 22 teachers of religious\r\neducation who have had no professional training for the work. This\r\nmeans that one-fourth of the entire corp of teachers of religion in\r\nthese institutions are without the prestige, at least, of even the\r\nsemblance of professional training. Two main causes account for this.\r\nThese institutions have not those who are professionally trained on\r\ntheir faculties and they lack funds to procure the service of such\r\npersons. In the next place they think it is not necessary.\r\n\r\nOne observation here is important. These services seem to be\r\nsignificant in proportion to the participation in them by the students\r\nthemselves. The Sunday School and the Young People's meetings are the\r\nmost popular services for the students. They do the things in which\r\nthey have a volitional interest. We cannot thrust our religious\r\nexperiences upon the students from without. They must achieve their\r\nown religious experience in contact with the environment in which they\r\nlive. The prayer meetings in all except four institutions follow a\r\nprogram which was effective for those who lived in another\r\ncivilization. The traditional Negro prayer meeting does not function\r\nreligiously in the life of the Negro college student.\r\n\r\nOne of the big problems of religious education is compulsion in regard\r\nto religious services. Where should that stop? Many are beginning to\r\nthink that the religious value of the services is often nullified by\r\nthe compulsory attendance. There are many conscientious objectors\r\namong the students who think the removal of compulsion would be\r\nconducive to better religious development. But the likelihood of some\r\nswinging from one extreme to the other is very great. It is still a\r\nproblem left for the religious educators in the colleges to solve. The\r\nsolution must result in the conservation of the good found in the\r\ncompulsory system and the good to be found in freedom of choice.\r\n\r\nExpressional activities are increasing in Negro colleges but with few\r\nexceptions these are inadequate in scope and number. It is true that\r\nnot enough students are able to share in the social service projects.\r\nThis is really one of, if not the most important factors in religious\r\neducation. Men gain religious power by acting out their beliefs,\r\nallowing their convictions to flow out into service.\r\n\r\nThere is an unfortunate lack of coordination of religious agencies in\r\nNegro colleges. Frequently we find several organizations attempting to\r\ndo the same thing and each makes a miserable failure in the attempt.\r\nMore than that, this lack of coordination and correlation results in\r\nduplications which surely mean wasted energy and non-effectiveness. If\r\nall of the religious agencies were supervised in such a way that each\r\nwould know his specific task and would not overlap that of other\r\nagencies, much more effective work would be the result.\r\n\r\nThere are signs of hope in the religious education of these Negro\r\ncolleges. The almost unanimous recognition of the religious motive in\r\nefficient education by the educators and the manifest consciousness of\r\nneeds of better religious education have been mentioned. There are\r\nothers. An increasing number of trained teachers from Northern,\r\nEastern and Western colleges and universities is evident. These men\r\nand women are coming from the institutions where the points of view\r\nand training represented in the previous chapter are found. The summer\r\nschools of the various colleges and universities in the North, East\r\nand West are offering many of these modern religious education courses\r\nand larger numbers of the teachers of religious education are availing\r\nthemselves of the opportunities. Much literature of religious\r\neducation published recently is finding its way to these schools, the\r\nmost notable of which is the _Religious Education Magazine_.\r\n\r\nTABLE SHOWING STATISTICS ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION IN NEGRO COLLEGES\r\n\r\n                                                Units of Credit Given |\r\n       Students in Voluntary Courses of Religious Education |         |\r\n     Students in Curriculum Courses of Education |          |         |\r\n                      College Students |         |          |         |\r\n---------------------------------------+---------+----------+---------+\r\nAgricultural and M.

He was of unmixed African lineage, with the true Negro face,\r\nevery feature of which was strongly marked. He was not a preacher, as\r\nwas generally believed, though a man of deep religious and spiritual\r\nnature, and seemed inspired for the performance of some extraordinary\r\nwork. He was austere in life and manner, not given to society, but\r\ndevoted his spare moments to introspection and consecration. He\r\nthought often of what he had heard said of him as to the great work he\r\nwas to perform. He eventually became seized with this idea as a\r\nfrenzy. To use his own language he saw many visions. \"I saw white\r\nspirits and black spirits engaged in battle,\" said he, \"and the sun\r\ndarkened--the thunder rolled in the heavens, and blood flowed in\r\nstreams and I heard a voice saying, 'Such is your luck, such you are\r\ncalled to see and let it come rough or smooth you must surely bear\r\nit,'\"[2] This happened in 1825. He said he discovered drops of blood\r\non the corn as though it were dew from heaven, that he found on the\r\nleaves in the woods hieroglyphic characters and numbers, with the\r\nforms of men in different attitudes, portrayed in the blood and\r\nrepresenting the figures he had previously seen in the heavens.[3]\r\nThese were without doubt creatures of Nat Turner's own imagination\r\nmade by him with coloring matter to make the Negroes believe that he\r\nwas a prophet from God.\r\n\r\nReceiving, as he says, further directions from the Holy Spirit, he\r\ncommunicated his designs to four of his most confidential friends.\r\nJuly 4, 1831, the anniversary of American Independence, was the day on\r\nwhich the work of death was to have been begun. Nat Turner hesitated\r\nand allowed the time to pass by, when, the mysterious signs\r\nreappearing, he determined to begin at once the bloody work. Sunday,\r\nAugust 21, he met those who had pledged their cooperation and support.\r\nThey were Hark Travis, Henry Porter, Samuel Francis, Nelson Williams,\r\nWill Francis and Jack Reese, with Nat Turner making the seventh. They\r\nworked out their plans while they ate in the lonely woods of\r\nSouthampton their feast of consecration, remaining at the feast until\r\nlong after midnight. The massacre was begun at the house of Joseph\r\nTravis, the man to whom Nat Turner then belonged. Armed with a hatchet\r\nTurner entered his master's chamber, the door having been broken open\r\nwith the axe, and aimed the first blow of death. The hatchet glanced\r\nharmless from the head of the would-be victim and the first fatal blow\r\nwas given by Will Francis, the one of the party who had got into the\r\nplot without Nat Turner's suggestion. All of his master's household,\r\nfive in number, soon perished.[4]\r\n\r\nThe insurgents procured here four guns, several old muskets with a few\r\nrounds of ammunition. At the barn, under the command of Nat Turner the\r\nparty was drilled and maneuvered. Nat Turner himself assumed the title\r\nof General Cargill with a stipend of ten dollars a day. Henry Porter,\r\nthe paymaster, was to receive five dollars a day, and each private one\r\ndollar. Thence they marched from plantation to plantation until by\r\nMonday morning the party numbered fifteen with nine mounted. Before\r\nnine o'clock the force had increased to forty and the insurgents had\r\ncovered an extent of territory two or three miles distant from the\r\nfirst point of attack, sweeping everything before them. Nat Turner\r\ngenerally took his station in the rear, with fifteen or twenty of the\r\nbest armed and reliable men at the front, who generally approached the\r\nhouses as fast as their horses could run for the double purpose of\r\npreventing escapes and striking terror. His force continued to\r\nincrease until they numbered sixty, all armed with guns, axes, swords,\r\nand clubs, and mounted. This line of attack was kept up until late\r\nMonday afternoon, when they reached a point, about three miles distant\r\nfrom Jerusalem, the county seat, where Nat Turner reluctantly yielded\r\nto a halt while some of his forces went in search of reenforcements.\r\nHe was eager to push on to the county seat as speedily as possible and\r\ncapture it. This delay proved the turning point in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nImpatient at the delay of his men who had turned aside, Turner started\r\nto the mansion house whither they had gone and on their return to the\r\nwood found a party of white men who had pursued the bloody path of the\r\ninsurrectionists and disposed of the guard of eight men whom Turner\r\nhad left at the roadside. The white men numbered eighteen and were\r\nunder the command of Captain Alexander P. Peete. They had been\r\ndirected to reserve their fire until within thirty paces, but one of\r\ntheir number fired on the insurgents when within about one hundred\r\nyards. Half of the whites beat a precipitate retreat when Nat Turner\r\nordered his men to fire and rush on them. The few remaining white men\r\nstood their ground until Turner approached within fifty yards, when\r\nthey too followed the example of their comrades, fired and retreated\r\nwith several wounded. Turner pursued and overtook some of them and\r\ntheir complete slaughter was only prevented by the timely arrival of a\r\nparty of whites approaching in another direction from Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nBeing baffled, Nat Turner with a party of twenty men determined to\r\ncross the Nottaway river at the Cypress Bridge and attack Jerusalem\r\nwhere he expected to procure additional arms and ammunition from the\r\nrear. After trying in vain to collect a sufficient force to proceed to\r\nJerusalem, the insurgents turned back toward his rendezvous and\r\nreached Major Thomas Ridley's, where forty assembled. He placed out\r\nsentinels and lay down to sleep, but there was to be no sleep that\r\nnight. An attack on his forces was at hand, and the embarrassment\r\nwhich ensued left him with one half, but Turner, determined to recruit\r\nhis forces, was proceeding in his effort to rally new adherents when\r\nthe firing of a gun by Hark was the signal for a fire in ambush and a\r\nretreat followed. After this Turner never saw many of his men any\r\nmore. They had killed fifty-five whites but the tide had turned.\r\nTurner concealed himself in the woods but was not dismayed, for by\r\nmessenger he directed his forces to rally at the point from which on\r\nthe previous Sunday they had started out on their bloody work; but\r\nthe discovery of white men riding around the place as though they were\r\nlooking for some one in hiding convinced him that he had been\r\nbetrayed. The leader then gave up hope of an immediate renewal of the\r\nattack and on Thursday, after supplying himself with provisions from\r\nthe old plantation, he scratched a hole under a pile of fence rails in\r\na field and concealed himself for nearly six weeks, never leaving his\r\nhiding place except for a few minutes in the quiet of night to obtain\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA reign of terror followed in Virginia.[5] Labor was paralyzed,\r\nplantations abandoned, women and children were driven from home and\r\ncrowded into nooks and corners. The sufferings of many of these\r\nrefugees who spent night after night in the woods were intense.\r\nRetaliation began. In a little more than one day 120 Negroes were\r\nkilled. The newspapers of the times contained from day to day\r\nindignant protests against the cruelties perpetrated. One individual\r\nboasted that he himself had killed between ten and fifteen Negroes.\r\nVolunteer whites rode in all directions visiting plantations. Negroes\r\nwere tortured to death, burned, maimed and subjected to nameless\r\natrocities. Slaves who were distrusted were pointed out and if they\r\nendeavored to escape, they were ruthlessly shot down.[6]\r\n\r\nA few individual instances will show the nature and extent of this\r\nvengeance. \"A party of horsemen started from Richmond with the\r\nintention of killing every colored person they saw in Southampton\r\nCounty. They stopped opposite the cabin of a free colored man who was\r\nhoeing in his little field. They called out, 'Is this Southampton\r\nCounty?' He replied, 'Yes Sir, you have just crossed the line, by\r\nyonder tree.' They shot him dead and rode on.\"[7] A slaveholder went\r\nto the woods accompanied by a faithful slave, who had been the means\r\nof saving his master's life during the insurrection. When they reached\r\na retired place in the forest, the man handed his gun to his master,\r\ninforming him that he could not live a slave any longer, and requested\r\neither to free him or shoot him on the spot. The master took the gun,\r\nin some trepidation, levelled it at the faithful Negro and shot him\r\nthrough the heart.[8]\r\n\r\nBut these outrages were not limited to the Negro population. There\r\noccurred other instances which strikingly remind one of scenes before\r\nthe Civil War and during reconstruction. An Englishman, named\r\nRobinson, was engaged in selling books at Petersburg. An alarm being\r\ngiven one night that five hundred blacks were marching against the\r\ntown, he stood guard with others at the bridge. After the panic had a\r\nlittle subsided he happened to make the remark that the blacks as men\r\nwere entitled to their freedom and ought to be emancipated. This led\r\nto great excitement and the man was warned to leave the town. He took\r\npassage in the stage coach, but the vehicle was intercepted. He then\r\nfled to a friend's home but the house was broken open and he was\r\ndragged forth. The civil authorities informed of the affair refused to\r\ninterfere. The mob stripped him, gave him a considerable number of\r\nlashes and sent him on foot naked under a hot sun to Richmond, whence\r\nhe with difficulty found passage to New York.[9]\r\n\r\nBelieving that Nat Turner's insurrection was a general conspiracy, the\r\npeople throughout the State were highly excited. The Governor of the\r\ncommonwealth quickly called into service whatever forces were at his\r\ncommand. The lack of adequate munitions of war being apparent,\r\nCommodore Warrington, in command of the Navy Yard in Gosport, was\r\ninduced to distribute a portion of the public arms under his control.\r\nFor this purpose the government ordered detachments of the Light\r\nInfantry from the seventh and fifty-fourth Regiments and from the\r\nfourth Regiment of cavalry and also from the fourth Light Artillery to\r\ntake the field under Brigadier General Eppes. Two regiments in\r\nBrunswick and Greenville were also called into service under General\r\nWilliam H. Brodnax and continued in the field until the danger had\r\npassed. Further aid was afforded by Commodore Eliott of the United\r\nStates Navy by order of whom a detachment of sailors from the\r\n_Natchez_ was secured and assistance also from Colonel House, the\r\ncommanding officer at Fortress Monroe, who promptly detached a part of\r\nhis force to take the field under Lieutenant Colonel Worth.[10] The\r\nrevolt was subdued, however, before these troops could be placed in\r\naction and about all they accomplished thereafter was the terrifying\r\nof Negroes who had taken no part in the insurrection and the\r\nimmolation of others who were suspected.\r\n\r\nSixty-one white persons were killed. Not a Negro was slain in any of\r\nthe encounters led by Turner. Fifty-three Negroes were apprehended and\r\narraigned. Seventeen of the insurrectionists were convicted, and\r\nexecuted, twelve convicted and transported, ten acquitted, seven\r\ndischarged and four sent on to the Superior Court. Four of those\r\nconvicted and transported were boys. There were brought to trial only\r\nfour free Negroes, one of whom was discharged and three held for\r\nsubsequent trial were finally executed. It is said that they were\r\ngiven decent burial.[11]\r\n\r\nThe news of the Southampton insurrection thrilled the whole country,\r\nNorth as well as South. The newspapers teemed with the accounts of\r\nit.[12] Rumors of similar outbreaks prevailed all over the State of\r\nVirginia and throughout the South. There were rumors to the effect\r\nthat Nat Turner was everywhere at the same time. People returned home\r\nbefore twilight, barricaded themselves in their homes, kept watch\r\nduring the night, or abandoned their homes for centers where armed\r\nforce was adequate to their protection. There were many such false\r\nreports as the one that two maid servants in Dinwiddie County had\r\nmurdered an old lady and two children. Negroes throughout the State\r\nwere suspected, arrested and prosecuted on the least pretext and in\r\nsome cases murdered without any cause. Almost any Negro having some of\r\nthe much advertised characteristics of Nat Turner was in danger of\r\nbeing run down and torn to pieces for Nat Turner himself.\r\n\r\nThere came an unusual rumor from North Carolina. It was said that\r\nNegro insurgents there had burnt Wilmington, massacred its\r\ninhabitants, and that 2,000 were then marching on Raleigh. This was\r\nnot true but there was a plot worked out by twenty-four Negroes who\r\nhad extended their operations into Duplin, Sampson, Wayne, New\r\nHanover, and Lenoir Counties. The plot having been revealed by a free\r\nNegro, the militia was called out in time to prevent the carrying out\r\nof these well-laid plans. Raleigh and Fayetteville were put under\r\nmilitary defence. Many arrests were made, several whipped and released\r\nand three of the leaders executed. One of these, a very intelligent\r\nNegro preacher named David, was convicted on the testimony of another\r\nNegro.[13]\r\n\r\nThe excitement in other States was not much less than in Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina. In South Carolina Governor Hayne issued a proclamation\r\nto quiet rumors of similar uprisings. In Macon, Georgia, the entire\r\npopulation rose at midnight, roused from their beds by rumors of an\r\nimpending onslaught. Slaves were arrested and tied to trees in\r\ndifferent parts of the State, while captains of the militia delighted\r\nin hacking at them with swords. In Alabama, rumors of a joint\r\nconspiracy of Indians and Negroes found ready credence. At New Orleans\r\nthe excitement was at such a height that a report that 1,200 stands of\r\narms were found in a black man's house, was readily believed.[14]\r\n\r\nBut the people were not satisfied with this flow of blood and passions\r\nwere not subdued with these public wreakings. Nat Turner was still at\r\nlarge. He had eluded their constant vigilance ever since the day of\r\nthe raid in August. That he was finally captured was more the result\r\nof accident than of design. A dog belonging to some of Nat Turner's\r\nacquaintances scented some meat in the cave and stole it one night\r\nwhile Turner was out. Shortly after, two Negroes, one the owner of the\r\ndog, were hunting with the same animal. The dog barked at Turner who\r\nhad just gone out to walk. Thinking himself discovered, Turner begged\r\nthese men to conceal his whereabouts, but they, on finding out who it\r\nwas, precipitately fled. Concluding from this that they would betray\r\nhim, Turner left his hiding place, but he was pursued almost\r\nincessantly. At one time he was shot at by one Francis near a fodder\r\nstack in a field, but happening to fall at the moment of the\r\ndischarge, the contents of the pistol passed through the crown of his\r\nhat. The lines, however, were closing upon Turner. His escape from\r\nFrancis added new enthusiasm to the pursuit and Turner's resources as\r\nfertile as ever contrived a new hiding place in a sort of den in the\r\nlap of a fallen tree over which he placed fine brush. He protruded his\r\nhead as if to reconnoiter about noon, Sunday, October 30, when a\r\nBenjamin Phipps, who had that morning for the first time turned out in\r\npursuit, came suddenly upon him. Phipps not knowing him, demanded:\r\n\"Who are you?\" He was answered, \"I am Nat Turner.\" Phipps then ordered\r\nhim to extend his arms and Turner obeyed, delivering up a sword which\r\nwas the only weapon he then had.[15]\r\n\r\nThis was ten weeks after that Sunday in August when they had feasted\r\nin the woods and arranged their plan of attack. At the time of the\r\ncapture there were at least fifty men out in search of him, none of\r\nwhom could have been two miles from the hiding place. The _Richmond\r\nEnquirer_ in giving the first public announcement, said: \"Nat\r\ndisplayed no sort of enterprise in his attempt to escape nor any\r\ndegree of courage in resisting his captor;\" but this journal does not\r\ngive him credit for having eluded his pursuers for more than two\r\nmonths or for knowing that discretion is the better part of valor.\r\nSeveral companies of the State militia and a battalion of United\r\nStates marines had joined in the search and failed, yet Nat displayed\r\nno enterprise.[16]\r\n\r\nHis arrest caused much relief. He was taken the next day to Jerusalem,\r\nthe county seat, and tried on the fifth of November before a board of\r\nmagistrates. The indictment against him was for making insurrection\r\nand plotting to take away the lives of divers free white persons on\r\nthe twenty-second of August, 1831. On his arraignment Turner pleaded\r\n\"Not Guilty.\" The Commonwealth submitted its case, not on the\r\ntestimony of any eye witnesses but on the depositions of one Levi\r\nWaller who read Turner's _Confession_[17] and Colonel Trezevant the\r\ncommitting magistrate corroborated it by referring to the same\r\nconfession. Turner introduced no testimony in defense and his counsel\r\nmade no argument in his behalf. He was promptly found guilty and\r\nsentenced to be hanged Friday, November 11, 1831, twelve days after\r\nhis capture. During the examination Nat evinced great intelligence and\r\nmuch shrewdness of intellect, answering every question clearly and\r\ndistinctly and without confusion or prevarication.\r\n\r\nAn immense throng gathered on the day of execution though few were\r\npermitted to see the ceremony. He exhibited the utmost composure and\r\ncalm resignation. Although assured if he felt it proper he might\r\naddress the immense crowd, he declined to avail himself of the\r\nprivilege, but told the sheriff in a firm voice that he was ready. Not\r\na limb nor a muscle was observed to move. His body was given over to\r\nthe surgeons for dissection. He was skinned to supply such souvenirs\r\nas purses, his flesh made into grease, and his bones divided as\r\ntrophies to be handed down as heirlooms. It is said that there still\r\nlives a Virginian who has a piece of his skin which was tanned, that\r\nanother Virginian possesses one of his ears and that the skull graces\r\nthe collection of a physician in the city of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nConsidering the situation unusually serious, Governor John Floyd made\r\nthis the dominant thought of his message to the legislature that year.\r\nMore space was devoted to a discussion of this uprising than to any\r\nother single fact mentioned in the message. He was of the opinion that\r\nthe spirit of insurrection was not confined to Southampton. The\r\nGovernor believed that there were well-drawn plans of treason,\r\ninsurrection and murder, \"designed and matured by unrestrained\r\nfanatics in some of the neighboring States, who found facilities in\r\ndistributing their views and plans amongst our population either\r\nthrough the post office or by agents sent for that purpose throughout\r\nour territory.\" He, therefore, corresponded with the governors of\r\ncommonwealths to preserve as far as possible \"the good understanding\r\nwhich existed and which ought to be cherished between the different\r\nmembers of this Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor believed that the persons most active in stirring up the\r\nrevolt were Negro preachers. \"They had acquired,\" said he, \"great\r\nascendency over the minds of their fellows, and infused all their\r\nopinions which had prepared them for the development of the final\r\ndesign. There was also some reason to believe,\" thought he, \"those\r\npreachers have a perfect understanding in relation to these plans\r\nthroughout the eastern counties; and have been the channels through\r\nwhich the inflammatory papers and pamphlets, brought here by the\r\nagents and emissaries from other States, have been circulated amongst\r\nour slaves.\" He considered it a weakness in the laws of the State that\r\nfacilities for assembly, to plot, treason, and conspiracy, to revolt\r\nand make insurrection, had been afforded by the lack of legislation to\r\nthe contrary to prevent such freedom of movement among the Negroes. He\r\nbelieved, therefore, the public good required that the Negro preachers\r\nbe silenced, \"because, full of ignorance, they were incapable of\r\ninculcating anything but notions of the wildest superstition, thus\r\npreparing fit instruments in the hands of crafty agitators, to destroy\r\nthe public tranquility.\"[18]\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, recommended as a means against the possible repetition\r\nof such sanguinary scenes the revision of the laws to preserve in due\r\nsubordination the Negroes of the State. He believed, moreover, that\r\nalthough this insurrection had been due to the work of slaves, that\r\nthe free people of color furnished a much more promising field for the\r\noperations of the abolition element of the North, inasmuch as they had\r\nopened to them more enlarged views and urged the achievement of a\r\nhigher destiny by means, \"for the present less violent, but not\r\ndiffering in the end from those presented to the slaves.\" He referred\r\nto the free Negroes as \"that class of the community, which our laws\r\nhave hitherto treated with indulgent kindness,\" and for whom many\r\ninstances of solicitude for their welfare have marked the progress of\r\nlegislation. If, however, thought he, the slave who is confined by law\r\nto the estate of his master can work such destruction, how much more\r\neasy it would be for the free Negro to afflict the community with a\r\nstill greater calamity. The Governor, moreover, referred to the fact\r\nthat the free people of color had placed themselves in hostile array\r\nagainst every measure designed to remove them from the State and\r\nraised the question as to whether the last benefit which the State\r\nmight confer upon them might not be to appropriate annually a sum of\r\nmoney to aid their removal to other soil.[19]\r\n\r\nTo show how general the excitement was throughout the State one needs\r\nbut read in the journal of the legislature the number of petitions\r\npraying that some action be taken to provide for the safety of the\r\npeople in the commonwealth.[20] In the Valley and in the extreme\r\nwestern portion of the State where few slaves were found and where\r\nthere were still persons who did not welcome the institution, there\r\nwere held a number of meetings in which the abolition of slavery was\r\nopenly discussed and urged. Such memorials, however, did not\r\nconstitute the majority of the petitions requiring action with\r\nreference to slavery. More meetings were held in the eastern counties\r\nbut opinion there differed so widely that they availed little in\r\nworking out a constructive plan. The larger number of these took the\r\nform of such an improvement and change in the black code as to\r\npreserve the institution and at the same time secure the safety of the\r\ncitizens.[21]\r\n\r\nBelieving that the free people of color had been or would be the most\r\neffective means in the attack on the institution of slavery, there\r\nwere more memorials for the removal of this class of the population\r\nthan any other petitions bearing on slavery. Among the counties\r\npraying for the removal of the free Negroes, were Amelia, Isle of\r\nWight, York, Nansemond, Frederick, Powhatan, Fairfax, and\r\nNorthumberland. Others asked for the removal of the free Negroes[22]\r\nand furthermore the purchase of slaves to be deported. Among the\r\ncounties praying for such a measure were Fauquier, Hanover,\r\nWashington, Nelson, Loudoun, Prince William, and King William. From\r\nCharles City, Rockbridge, and Caroline Counties came the additional\r\nrequest for a legislation providing for gradual emancipation. Page,\r\nAugusta, Fauquier, and Botetourt, sent memorials praying that steps be\r\ntaken to procure an amendment to the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, investing Congress with the power to appropriate money for\r\nsending beyond the limits of the United States the free people of\r\ncolor and such of the slaves as might be purchased for the same\r\npurpose. This was almost in keeping with the request from the Henrico\r\nand Frederick Colonization Societies asking the Government to deport\r\nthe Negroes to Africa. Buckingham County requested that the colored\r\npopulation be removed from the county and colonized according to the\r\nplans set forth by Thomas Jefferson. The request of the Society of\r\nFriends in the county of Charles City for gradual emancipation,\r\nhowever, caused resentment.[23]\r\n\r\nThinking that it might not be possible to transport all the Negroes of\r\nthe country very easily, requests for dealing with the situation as it\r\nwas, were also in order. As a number of the farmers had suffered from\r\na loss of sheep by the numerous dogs maintained by slaves and free\r\npersons of color, there came requests praying that the keeping of dogs\r\nand hogs by Negroes be made illegal. Some of these petitions, too, had\r\nan economic phase. There came from Culpepper a petition praying for a\r\npassage of the law for the encouragement of white mechanics by\r\nprohibiting any slave, free Negro or mulatto from being bound as an\r\napprentice to learn any trade or art. Charles City and New Kent\r\ncomplained against the practice of employing slaves and Negroes as\r\nmillers and asked that a law penalizing such action be enacted.[24]\r\n\r\nThe question as to what should be done with the blacks turned out to\r\nbe the most important matter brought before the legislature.\r\nThree-fourths of the session was devoted to the discussion of such\r\nquestions as the removal of the free Negroes and the colonization of\r\nsuch slaves as masters could be induced to give up. The legislature\r\nmet on the 5th of December and after going through the preliminaries\r\nof organization listened to the message of the Governor which had the\r\ninsurrection as its most prominent feature. When the petitions from\r\nthe various counties began to come in, there soon prevailed a motion\r\nthat so much of the Governor's message as related to the insurrection\r\nof slaves and the removal of the free Negroes be referred to a select\r\ncommittee, which after prolonged deliberation found it difficult to\r\nagree upon a report.\r\n\r\nDesiring to protect the interests of slavery, William O. Goode, of\r\nMecklenburg County, moved on the eleventh of January that the select\r\ncommittee appointed to consider the memorials bearing on slaves free\r\nNegroes and the Southampton massacre be discharged from the\r\nconsideration of all petitions, memorials and resolutions, which had\r\nfor their object the manumission of slaves. The resolution further\r\ndeclared that it was not expedient to legislate on slavery.[25]\r\nWhereupon Thomas Jefferson Randolph, of Albemarle County, moved to\r\namend this resolution so as to instruct the committee to inquire into\r\nthe expediency and to report a bill to submit to the voters of the\r\nState the propriety of providing by law that the children of all\r\nfemale slaves who might be born in that State on or after the fourth\r\nday of July, 1840, should become the property of the commonwealth, the\r\nmales at the age of twenty-one years and females at the age of\r\neighteen, if detained by their owners within the limits of the\r\ncommonwealth, until they should respectively arrive at the ages\r\naforesaid. They would then be hired out until the net sum arising\r\ntherefrom should be sufficient to defray the expenses of their removal\r\nbeyond the limits of the United States.[26]\r\n\r\nAfter several days of heated but fruitless discussion marked by\r\nadjournment to calm the troubled waters, the question assumed a new\r\nphase when William H. Brodnax, the chairman of the select committee,\r\nreported the resolution: _That it is inexpedient for the present to\r\nmake any legislative enactments for the abolition of slavery._\r\nWhereupon Mr. William A. Patterson of Chesterfield County moved to\r\namend this resolution so as to read: _That it was expedient to adopt\r\nsome legislative enactments for the abolition of slavery._[27] Around\r\nGoode's motion, Randolph's substitute and Preston's amendments\r\ncentered an exciting debate showing such a wide difference of opinion\r\nthat the publicity caused about as much excitement as Nat Turner's\r\ninsurrection itself. Many citizens protested against such an open\r\ndiscussion, knowing that slaves able to read might thereby be induced\r\nto rise again.[28] This fear, however, did not serve very well as a\r\nrestraining factor.\r\n\r\nThe warning sounded by some of these people is significant. _The\r\nRichmond Enquirer_ the chief organ of thought in the State expressed\r\nin a strong editorial that the evils of slavery were alarming and\r\nurged that some definite action be taken immediately since the policy\r\nof deferring the solution of the problem for future generations had\r\nbrought the commonwealth to grief.[29] Certain ladies from Fluvanna\r\nCounty said in their memorial: \"We cannot conceal from ourselves that\r\nan evil is among us, which threatens to outgrow the growth and eclipse\r\nthe brightness of our national blessings.\"[30] Brodnax deplored the\r\nfact that the time had come in Virginia \"When men were found to lock\r\ntheir doors and open them in the morning to receive their servants to\r\nlight their fires, with pistols in their hands.\"[31]\r\n\r\nA summary of this debate shows that a few members of the legislature\r\ndesired instant abolition, a much larger number, probably a majority\r\nof the body, wanted to work out some scheme for gradual emancipation,\r\nand others feeling that the slaves could be controlled by severe laws,\r\nendeavored to restrict the effort to the removal of the free people of\r\ncolor. Certain citizens of Hanover desired to lay a tax on slaves and\r\nfree Negroes to raise funds to deport them all.[32] The unfortunate\r\ndevelopment, however, was that no one knew exactly what he wanted, no\r\none came to the legislature with a well-matured plan to remedy the\r\nevils, and every man seemed to be governed in his action by his local\r\ninterests rather than those of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe Preston amendment was, after an exciting discussion, finally\r\ndefeated on the 25th of January by a vote of 58 to 73. Thereupon on\r\nmotion of Mr. Archibald Bryce, of Goochland County, the legislature\r\namended the report of the select committee by inserting the following:\r\n\"Profoundly sensible of the great evils arising from the condition of\r\nthe colored population of this commonwealth induced by humanity, as\r\nwell as by policy to an immediate effort for the removal in the first\r\nplace, as well of those who are now free, as of such as may hereafter\r\nbecome free: believing that this effort, while it is in just\r\naccordance with the sentiment of the community on the subject, will\r\nabsorb all our present means, and that a further action for the\r\nremoval of the slaves should await a more definite development of\r\npublic opinion.[33]\r\n\r\nThis resolution aptly describes the situation resulting after the\r\nprolonged discussion. A majority of the members believed that slavery\r\nwas an evil, but no one was willing to pay the cost of exterminating\r\nit. It was easily shown that because of unprofitable slave labor the\r\ncommonwealth was lagging behind the free States and that the free\r\nlabor essential to the rebuilding of the waste places in the State\r\nwould never come to the commonwealth as long as there would be\r\ncompetition with slave labor. It was soon apparent, however, that a\r\nState with such a diversity of interests, one-half slave and one-half\r\nfree could not legislate on slavery. This compromising resolution of\r\nprocrastination, therefore, was adopted as the best Virginia could\r\nunder the circumstances be induced to do for the extermination[34] of\r\nits worst evil.\r\n\r\nThe debate proved to be valuable to the abolitionists. In the course\r\nof his remarks Mr. Brodnax declared that the confidence of the people\r\nseemed to be gone. \"Under such circumstances life becomes a burthen\r\nand it is better to seek a home in some distant realm and leave the\r\ngraves of our fathers than endure so precarious a condition.\" It was\r\nevident, he thought, that something must be done; and although\r\nmeasures for the removal of this evil might not, perhaps be arrived\r\nat immediately yet some plan for its gradual eradication would\r\nprobably be hit upon. A system might be concocted by degrees to\r\nembrace the whole subject and it was therefore necessary to consider\r\nit in all its bearings.[35]\r\n\r\nMr. Chandler said that he in common with his constituents looked\r\nforward to the passage of a law for the removal of the free blacks. He\r\nwas also in favor of the consideration of any plan which might remove\r\nentirely at some future time, the greatest curse that had ever been\r\ninflicted upon this State. He would look upon the day on which the\r\ndeliverance of the commonwealth from the burden of slavery should be\r\naccomplished as the most glorious in the annals of Virginia since the\r\nfourth of July, 1776.[36] Mr. Moore did not wish to entangle the\r\ncommittee on the subject of getting rid of the free black population\r\nof this State. That population, he knew, was a nuisance which the\r\ninterests of the people required to remove, but there was another and\r\na greater nuisance, slavery itself. He wished that it should be\r\nconsidered and if it were possible to devise any plan for the ultimate\r\nextinction of slavery, he would rejoice.[37]\r\n\r\nMr. Bolling rose in his remarks to a height of moral sublimity. \"We\r\ntalk of freedom,\" said he, \"while slavery exists in this land; and\r\nspeak with horror of the tyranny of the Turk. We foster an evil which\r\nthe highest interests of the community require should be removed,\r\nwhich was denounced as the bans of our happiness by the Father of the\r\nCommonwealth and to which we trace the cause of the lamentable\r\ndepression of Eastern Virginia. Every intelligent individual admits\r\nthat slavery is the most pernicious evil with which a body politic can\r\nbe afflicted.\"[38]\r\n\r\nMr. Randolph, the grandson of Thomas Jefferson, said that it was the\r\ndark, the appalling, the despairing future that had awakened the\r\npublic mind rather than the Southampton Insurrection. He asked whether\r\nsilence would restore the death-like apathy of the Negro's mind. It\r\nmight be wise to let it sleep in its torpor; \"but has not,\" he asked,\r\n\"its dark chaos been illumined? Does it not move, and feel and think?\r\nThe hour of the eradication of the evil is advancing, it must come.\r\nWhether it is affected by the energy of our minds or by the bloody\r\nscenes of Southampton and San Domingo is a tale for future\r\nhistory.\"[39] Mr. Faulkner addressed the House in favor of the gradual\r\nextinction of slavery, concluding with these words: \"Tax our lands,\r\nvilify our country, carry the sword of extermination through our\r\ndefenceless villages but spare us the curse of slavery, that bitterest\r\ndrop from the chalice of the destroying angel.\"[40]\r\n\r\nMr. MacDowell, referring to the insurrection, thus described its\r\nterror and its awful lesson: \"It drove families from their homes,\r\nassembled women and children in crowds in every condition of weakness\r\nand infirmity, and every suffering that want and terror could inflict,\r\nto escape the terrible dread of domestic assassination. It erected a\r\npeaceful and confiding State into a military camp which outlawed from\r\npity the unfortunate beings whose brothers had offended; which barred\r\nevery door, penetrated every bosom with fear or suspicion, which so\r\nbanished every sense of security from every man's dwelling; that, let\r\nbut a hoof or horn break upon the silence of the night, and an aching\r\nthrob would be driven to the heart. The husband would look to his\r\nweapon and the mother would shudder and weep upon her cradle. Was it\r\nthe fear of Nat Turner and his deluded drunken handful of followers,\r\nwhich produced such effects? Was it this that induced distant counties\r\nwhere the very name of Southampton was strange to arm and equip for a\r\nstruggle? No sir, it was the suspicion eternally attached to the slave\r\nhimself, a suspicion that a Nat Turner might be in every family, that\r\nthe same bloody deed might be acted over at any time and in any\r\nplace, that the materials for it were spread through the land and were\r\nalways ready for a like explosion.\"[41]\r\n\r\nAlthough no agreement on the extinction of slavery could be reached,\r\nthe question of removing the free people of color was decidedly\r\nanother matter. Many who were unwilling to legislate with reference to\r\nslavery did not object to the proposal to remove the free Negroes from\r\nthe State. Yet there were others who looked upon this as a political\r\nby-play. The Southampton Insurrection was not the work of free Negroes\r\nbut that of slaves. Only two of the many free Negroes in Southampton\r\ncounty took a part in the insurrection and these two had slave wives.\r\nThe North Carolina plot, moreover, was revealed by a free Negro. Many\r\ncitizens agreed too with a _Richmond Enquirer_ correspondent of\r\nHanover, who in speaking for the free people of color pointed out the\r\ngood they had been to the community,[42] and the Governor who in his\r\nannual message raised the question as to propriety of removing them,\r\nsaid that the laws of the State had theretofore treated the free\r\npeople of color with \"indulgent kindness\" and that \"many instances of\r\nsolicitude for their welfare\" had \"marked the progress of\r\nlegislation.\"[43]\r\n\r\nA bill for removal, however, was promptly offered on the\r\ntwenty-seventh of January.[44] On the first of February there was\r\npresented an additional report deeming it expedient to set apart for\r\nthe removal of the free colored population so much of the claims of\r\nVirginia on the General Government as may come into and belong to the\r\ntreasury of the State.[45] A few days later Mr. Moore submitted a\r\nresolution covering the same ground and calling upon the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives of Virginia in Congress to use their best efforts to\r\npromote this project.[46] The Matter was tabled but on the 6th of\r\nFebruary the House resolved itself into a committee of the whole to\r\ntake this bill into consideration. After prolonged discussion the\r\nmatter was again tabled with a view to future consideration. The\r\nfeeling of the majority seemed to be that, if the Negroes were\r\nremoved, no coercion should be employed except in the case of those\r\nwho remained in the State contrary to the law of 1806.[47] $35,000 for\r\n1832 and $90,000 for 1833 was to be appropriated for transportation. A\r\ncentral board consisting of the governor, treasurer, and members of\r\nthe Council of State was to decide the place to which these Negroes\r\nwere to be expatriated and the agents to carry out the law would also\r\nbe named by the same board.[48] The bill for the removal of free\r\nNegroes was indefinitely postponed in the Senate by a vote of 18 to 14\r\nand therefore was never taken up.\r\n\r\nThe next effort of the legislature in dealing with the Negroes was to\r\nstrengthen the black code as it then existed so as to provide for a\r\nmore adequate supervision and rigid control of the slaves and free\r\npeople of color. There was offered thereafter a bill to amend an act\r\nentitled \"an act to revise under one the several acts concerning\r\nslaves, free Negroes and mulattoes.\" The important provisions of the\r\nbill were that slaves and free Negroes should not conduct religious\r\nexercises nor attend meetings held at night by white preachers unless\r\ngranted written permission by their masters or overseers. Thereafter\r\nno free Negro should be capable of purchase or otherwise acquiring\r\npermanent ownership, except by descent, of any slave, other than his\r\nor her husband, wife or children. Further penalties, moreover, were\r\nprovided for persons writing or printing anything intended to incite\r\nthe Negroes to insurrection. The State had already enacted a law\r\nprohibiting the teaching of slaves, free Negroes and mulattoes.[49]\r\nThe other petitions requiring that Negroes be restricted in the higher\r\npursuits of labor and in the ownership of hogs and dogs were, because\r\nof the spirit which existed after the excitement had subsided,\r\nrejected as unnecessary. The law providing for burning in the hand was\r\nrepealed. The immigration of free Negroes into the State, however, was\r\nprohibited in 1834.[50]\r\n\r\nThe effect of this insurrection and this debate extended far beyond\r\nthe borders of Virginia and the South. Governor McArthur of Ohio in a\r\nmessage to his legislature called special attention to the outbreak\r\nand the necessity for prohibitive legislation against the influx\r\nwithin that commonwealth of the free people of color who naturally\r\nsought an asylum in the free States. The effect in Southern States was\r\nfar more significant. Many of them already had sufficient regulations\r\nto meet such emergencies as that of an insurrection but others found\r\nit necessary to revise their black codes.\r\n\r\nMaryland passed, at the session of its legislature in 1831-1832, a law\r\nproviding a board of managers to use a fund appropriated for the\r\npurpose of removing the free people of color to Liberia in connection\r\nwith the State colonization society.[51] Another act forbade the\r\nintroduction of slaves either for sale or resident and the immigration\r\nof free Negroes. It imposed many disabilities on the resident free\r\npeople of color so as to force them to emigrate.[52] Delaware, which\r\nhad by its constitution of 1831, restricted the right of franchise to\r\nwhites[53] enacted in 1832 an act preventing the use of firearms by\r\nfree Negroes and provided also for the enforcement of the law of 1811\r\nagainst the immigration of free Negroes and mulattoes, prohibited\r\nmeetings of blacks after ten o'clock and forbade non-resident blacks\r\nto preach.[54]\r\n\r\nIn 1831 Tennessee forbade free persons of color to immigrate into that\r\nState under the penalty of fine for remaining and imprisonment in\r\ndefault of payment. Persons emancipating slaves had to give bond for\r\ntheir removal to some point outside of the State[55] and additional\r\npenalties were provided for slaves found assembling or engaged in\r\nconspiracy. Georgia enacted a measure to the effect that none might\r\ngive credit to free persons of color without order from their guardian\r\nrequired by law and, if insolvent, they might be bound out. It further\r\nprovided that neither free Negroes nor slaves might preach or exhort\r\nan assembly of more than seven unless licensed by justices on\r\ncertificate of three ordained ministers. They were also forbidden to\r\ncarry firearms.[56] North Carolina, in which Negroes voted until 1834,\r\nenacted in 1831 a special law prohibiting free Negroes from preaching\r\nand slaves from keeping house or going at large as free men. To\r\ncollect fines of free Negroes the law authorized that they might be\r\nsold.[57] The new constitution of the State in 1835 restricted the\r\nright of suffrage to white men. South Carolina passed in 1836 a law\r\nprohibiting the teaching of slaves to read and write under penalties,\r\nforbidding too the employment of a person of color as salesman in any\r\nhouse, store or shop used for trading. Mississippi had already met\r\nmost of these requirements in the slave code in the year 1830.[58]\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana it was deemed necessary to strengthen the slave code. An\r\nact relative to the introduction of slaves provided that slaves should\r\nnot be introduced except by persons immigrating to reside and citizens\r\nwho might become owners.[59] Previous legislation had already provided\r\nsevere penalties for persons teaching Negroes to read and write and\r\nalso had made provision for compelling free colored persons to leave\r\nthe State.[60] In 1832 the State of Alabama enacted a law making it\r\nunlawful for any free person of color to settle within that\r\ncommonwealth. Slaves or free persons of color should not be taught to\r\nspell, read or write. It provided penalties for Negroes writing passes\r\nand for free blacks associating or trading with slaves. More than five\r\nmale slaves were declared an unlawful assembly but slaves could attend\r\nworship conducted by whites yet neither slaves nor free Negroes were\r\npermitted to preach unless before five respectable slaveholders and\r\nthe Negroes so preaching were to be licensed by some neighboring\r\nreligious society. It was provided, however, that these sections of\r\nthe article did not apply to or affect any free person of color who,\r\nby the treaty between the United States and Spain, became citizens of\r\nthe United States.[61]\r\n\r\nSo many ills of the Negro followed, therefore, that one is inclined to\r\nquestion the wisdom of the insurgent leader. Whether Nat Turner\r\nhastened or postponed the day of the abolition of slavery, however, is\r\na question that admits of little or much discussion in accordance with\r\nopinions concerning the law of necessity and free will in national\r\nlife. Considered in the light of its immediate effect upon its\r\nparticipants, it was a failure, an egregious failure, a wanton crime.\r\nConsidered in its necessary relation to slavery and as contributory to\r\nmaking it a national issue by the deepening and stirring of the then\r\nweak local forces, that finally led to the Emancipation Proclamation\r\nand the Thirteenth Amendment, the insurrection was a moral success and\r\nNat Turner deserves to be ranked with the greatest reformers of his\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis insurrection may be considered an effort of the Negro to help\r\nhimself rather than depend on other human agencies for the protection\r\nwhich could come through his own strong arm; for the spirit of Nat\r\nTurner never was completely quelled. He struck ruthlessly,\r\nmercilessly, it may be said, in cold blood, innocent women and\r\nchildren; but the system of which he was the victim had less mercy in\r\nsubjecting his race to the horrors of the \"middle passages\" and the\r\nendless crimes against justice, humanity and virtue, then perpetrated\r\nthroughout America. The brutality of his onslaught was a reflex of\r\nslavery, the object lesson which he gave brought the question home to\r\nevery fireside until public conscience, once callous, became quickened\r\nand slavery was doomed.\r\n\r\n                                             JOHN W. CROMWELL\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Nat Turner was a familiar name in the household in which the\r\nauthor was reared, as his home was within fifty miles of the place of\r\nTurner's exploits. In 1871, the last term of the author's service as a\r\nteacher in the public schools of Virginia, was spent in this same\r\ncounty, with a people, many of whom personally knew Nat Turner and his\r\ncomrades.\r\n\r\nNat Turner was born October 2, 1800, the slave of Benjamin Turner. His\r\nfather, a native of Africa, escaped from slavery and finally emigrated\r\nto Liberia, where, it is said, his grave is quite as well known as\r\nthat of Franklin's, Jefferson's or Adams's is to the patriotic\r\nAmerican. There is now living in the city of Baltimore a man who on\r\ngood authority claims to be the grandson of Nat Turner and a son of\r\nhis was said to be still living in Southampton County, Virginia, in\r\n1896.\r\n\r\nIn his early years Turner had a presentiment which largely influenced\r\nhis subsequent life and confirmed him in the belief that he was\r\ndestined to play an unusual role in history. That prenatal influence\r\ngave him a marked individuality is readily believed when the date of\r\nhis birth is recalled, the period when the excitement over the\r\ndiscovery of Gabriel Prosser's plot was at its height. Nat's mind was\r\nvery restless and active, inquisitive and observant. He learned to\r\nread and write with no apparent difficulty. This ability gave him\r\nopportunity to confirm impressions as to knowledge of subjects in\r\nwhich he had received no instruction. When not working for his master,\r\nhe was engaged in prayer or in making sundry experiments. By intuition\r\nhe, in a rude way, manufactured paper, gunpowder, pottery and other\r\narticles in common use. This knowledge which he claimed to possess was\r\ntested by actual demonstration during the trial for his life. His\r\nsuperior skill in planning was universally admitted by his fellow\r\nworkmen. He did not, however, attribute this superior influence to\r\nsorcery, conjuration or such like agencies, for he had the utmost\r\ncontempt for these delusions.\r\n\r\n\"To this day,\" says T. W. Higginson, \"There are the Virginia slave\r\ntraditions of the keen devices of Prophet Nat. If he were caught with\r\nlime and lampblack in hand conning over a half-finished county map on\r\nthe barn door, he was always planning what he would do if he were\r\nblind. When he had called a meeting of slaves and some poor whites\r\ncame eavesdropping, the poor whites at once became the topic of\r\ndiscussion; he incidentally mentioned that the master had been heard\r\nthreatening to drive them away; one slave had been ordered to shoot\r\nMr. Jones' pigs, another to tear down Mr. Johnson's fences. The poor\r\nwhites, Johnson and Jones, ran home at once to see to their homesteads\r\nand were better friends than ever to poor Nat.\"--T. W.

An accurate likeness\r\nby John Crawley, a former artist of Norfolk at that time, lithographed\r\nby Endicott and Sweet of Baltimore, accompanied the edition which was\r\nprinted for T. R. Gray, Turner's attorney. Fully 50,000 copies of this\r\npamphlet are said to have been sold within a few weeks of its\r\npublication, yet today they are exceedingly rare, not a copy being\r\nfound either in the State Library at Richmond, the Public Library at\r\nBoston nor the Congressional Library at Washington. These\r\n_Confessions_ purport to give from Turner's own lips circumstances of\r\nhis life. \"Portions of it,\" says _The Richmond Enquirer_, \"are\r\neloquent and even classically expressed; but,\" continues the critic,\r\nmore than sixty miles away, \"the language is far superior to what Nat\r\nTurner could have employed, thereby giving him a character for\r\nintelligence which he does not deserve and should not receive.\" On the\r\ncontrary, however, Mr. Gray, his attorney and confessor who did not\r\nwrite from long range, said: \"As to his ignorance, he certainly had\r\nnot the advantages of education, but he can read and write and for\r\nnatural intelligence and quickness of apprehension is surpassed by few\r\nmen I have ever seen. Further the calm, deliberate composure with\r\nwhich he spoke of his late deeds and intentions, the expression of his\r\nfiend-like face when excited by enthusiasm; still bearing the stains\r\nof the blood of helpless innocence about him; clothed with rags and\r\ncovered with chains, yet daring to raise his manacled hands to heaven;\r\nwith a spirit soaring above the attributes of man, I looked on him and\r\nmy blood curdled in my veins.\"--_The Confessions of Nat Turner._\r\n\r\n[18] _The Journal of the House of Delegates_, 1831, pp. 9 and 10.\r\n\r\n[19] _The Journal of the House of Delegates_, 1831, p. 10.\r\n\r\n[20] In Fluvanna this memorial of certain ladies was agreed upon and\r\nsent to the legislature: \"We cannot conceal from ourselves that an\r\nevil is among us, which threatens to outgrow the growth and eclipse\r\nthe brightness of our national blessings. Our daughters and their\r\ndaughters are destined to become, in their turn, the tender fosterers\r\nof helpless infancy, the directors of developing childhood, and the\r\ncompanions of those citizens, who will occupy the legislative and\r\nexecutive offices of their country. Can we calmly anticipate the\r\ncondition of the Southern States at that period, should no remedy be\r\ndevised to arrest the progressive miseries attendant on slavery? Will\r\nthe absent father's heart be at peace, when, amid the hurry of public\r\naffairs, his truant thoughts return to the home of his affection,\r\nsurrounded by doubtful, if not dangerous, subjects to precarious\r\nauthority? Perhaps when deeply engaged in his legislative duties his\r\nheart may quail and his tongue falter with irresistible apprehension\r\nfor the peace and safety of objects dearer than life.\r\n\r\n\"We can only aid the mighty task by ardent outpourings of the spirit\r\nof supplication at the Throne of Grace.

The mark set on them by\r\nnature precludes their enjoyment in this country, of the privileges of\r\nthe former; and the laws of the land do not allow them to be reduced\r\nto the condition of the latter. Hence they are of necessity degraded,\r\nprofligate, vicious, turbulent and discontented.\r\n\r\n\"More frequent than whites (probably in tenfold proportion) sustained\r\nby the charitable provisions of our laws, they are altogether a burden\r\non the community. Pursuing no course of regular business, and\r\nnegligent of everything like economy and husbandry, they are as a part\r\nof the community, supported by the productive industry of others.\r\n\r\n\"But their residence among us is yet more objectionable on other\r\naccounts. It is incompatible with the tranquility of society; their\r\napparent exemption from want and care and servitude to business,\r\nexcites impracticable hopes in the minds of those who are even more\r\nignorant and unreflecting--and their locomotive habits fit them for a\r\ndangerous agency in schemes, wild and visionary, but disgusting and\r\nannoying.\r\n\r\n\"We would not be cruel and unchristian--but we must take care of the\r\ninterests and morals of society, and of the peace of mind of the\r\nhelpless in our families. It is indispensable to the happiness of the\r\nlatter, that this cause of apprehension be removed. And efforts to\r\nthis end are, we firmly believe, sanctioned by enlightened humanity\r\ntoward the ill-fated class to whom we allude. They can never have the\r\nrespect and intercourse here which are essential to rational\r\nhappiness, and social enjoyment and improvement. But in other lands\r\nthey may become an orderly, sober, industrious, moral, enlightened and\r\nchristian community; and be the happy instruments of planting and\r\ndiffusing those blessings over a barbarous and benighted continent.\r\n\r\n\"Your petitioners will not designate a plan of legislative\r\noperation--they leave to the wisdom and provident forecast of the\r\nGeneral Assembly, the conception and the prosecution of the best\r\npracticable scheme--but they would respectfully and earnestly ask that\r\nthe action of the laws passed to this effect be decisive, and the\r\nmeans energetic--such as shall, with as much speed as may be, free our\r\ncountry from this bane of its prosperity, morality and peace.\"--_The\r\nRichmond Enquirer_, Oct. 21, 1831.\r\n\r\n[23] _The Journal of the House of Delegates_, 1831, pp. 1-123.\r\n\r\n[24] _The Journal of the House of Delegates_, 1831, pp. 41, 56, 119.\r\n\r\n[25] _Ibid._, 1831, p. 93.\r\n\r\n[26] _The Journal of the House of Delegates_, 1831, p. 93.\r\n\r\n[27] _Ibid._, p. 93.\r\n\r\n[28] _Ibid._, p. 125.\r\n\r\n[29] _The Richmond Enquirer_, Jan. 7, 1832.\r\n\r\n[30] Drewry, _The Southampton Insurrection_, p. 165.\r\n\r\n[31] _The Richmond Enquirer_, Dec. 17, 1831.\r\n\r\n[32] _Ibid._, Nov. 18, 1831.\r\n\r\n[33] _The Journal of the House of Delegates_, 1831, p. 110.\r\n\r\n[34] Before the insurrection free men of color voted in North Carolina\r\nand at least one well-authenticated case exists of a colored voter in\r\nVirginia prior to 1830. A native of Virginia long a resident of\r\nMassachusetts is an authority for the statement that the facilities\r\nfor higher education of the Negro were quite as good in Richmond as in\r\nBoston at that time. There was published in a paper of the time an\r\naccount of the celebration of the anniversary of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, July 4, 1827, by the free people of color of the city of\r\nFredericksburg, Virginia. The orator of the day was Isaac N. Carey.\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina John Chavis, a Negro, rose to such excellence as a\r\nteacher of white youth that he is pronounced in a biographical sketch,\r\ncontained in a history of education in that State, published by the\r\nUnited States Bureau of Education, as one of the most eminent men\r\nproduced by that State. Though an unmistakable Negro, as a preacher he\r\nacceptably filled many a white pulpit and was welcomed as a social\r\nguest at many a fireside. Such was the bitterness against the race\r\ngrowing out of Nat Turner's Insurrection, however, that even such a\r\nman fell under the ban of proscription.\r\n\r\nOne of the preachers to whom Governor Floyd had reference quietly\r\nignored the suggestion in the message of his Excellency and kept up\r\nhis work. He was a Baptist preacher, William Carney, the grandfather\r\nof the famous Sergeant William H. Carney, of the 54th Massachusetts\r\nRegiment. At the same time a daughter of his and a Methodist in a\r\nneighboring town \"bearded the lion in his den\" by actually collaring\r\nand driving out the leader of a party of white men who broke into a\r\nNegro religious meeting.\r\n\r\n[35] _The Richmond Enquirer_, Jan. 11, 1839.\r\n\r\n[36] _Ibid._, Jan. 11, 1839.\r\n\r\n[37] _Ibid._, Jan. 19, 1832.\r\n\r\n[38] _Ibid._, Jan. 24, 1832.\r\n\r\n[39] _The Richmond Enquirer_, Jan. 25, 1832.\r\n\r\n[40] _Ibid._, Jan. 26, 1832.\r\n\r\n[41] _The Richmond Enquirer_, Jan. 27, 1832.\r\n\r\n[42] _Ibid._, Nov. 18, 1831.\r\n\r\n[43] _The Journal of the House of Delegates_, 1831, p. 10.\r\n\r\n[44] _Ibid._, p. 112.\r\n\r\n[45] _Ibid._, 1831, p. 125.\r\n\r\n[46] _Ibid._, 1831, p. 131.\r\n\r\n[47] _The Richmond Enquirer_, Jan. and Feb., 1832.\r\n\r\n[48] _The Journal of the House of Delegates_, 1831, Appendix, Bill No.\r\n7.\r\n\r\n[49] _Ibid._, Bill No. 13.\r\n\r\n[50] Hurd, _Law of Freedom and Bondage_, II, 9.\r\n\r\n[51] _The Laws of Maryland_, 1831-32, c. 281.\r\n\r\n[52] _Ibid._, c. 328.\r\n\r\n[53] See Article IV, Sec. 1.\r\n\r\n[54] Revised Code of Maryland, Chap. 52 and 237.7\r\n\r\n[55] _The Laws of Tenn._, 1831, Chaps. 102 and 103.\r\n\r\n[56] Cobb's _Digest of the Laws of Georgia_, 1005.\r\n\r\n[57] _Revised Statutes of North Carolina_, c. 109 and 111.\r\n\r\n[58] Hurd, _Law of Freedom and Bondage_, II, 146.\r\n\r\n[59] _Ibid._, II, 162.\r\n\r\n[60] _Laws of Louisiana_, 1830, p. 90, Sec. 1.\r\n\r\n[61] _Annual Laws of Alabama_, 1832, p. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publication of the list of names of Negroes who served in some of\r\nthe Reconstruction conventions and legislatures elicited a number of\r\ncomments which furnish desirable information.

Permit me to say that the late Bishop\r\n     James W. Hood represented that county and played a most prominent\r\n     part and afterward became Ass't Superintendent of Public\r\n     Instruction of the State. I was a boy at the time but I remember\r\n     it. That you may know that I am not an adventurer, I enclose you\r\n     a sketch of myself which was prepared by request for other\r\n     purposes and show that I speak somewhat from authority. You will\r\n     kindly return the same. At the same time you are at liberty to\r\n     use any part of it that may suit your purpose should you so\r\n     desire.\r\n\r\n     With very great respect, I am\r\n\r\n                              Respectfully,\r\n                                     (Signed) GEO. C. SCURLOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sketch of this participant in the Reconstruction follows:\r\n\r\n     Mr. George C. Scurlock, from the year 1874 was a prominent figure\r\n     in the Republican party in North Carolina. In the year above\r\n     stated, when he had barely reached his majority, he was nominated\r\n     for member of the Board of Education, at a time when all the\r\n     schools, white and colored, were under the same board. His\r\n     opponent was one of the most prominent Democrats in the city and\r\n     a majority of the electorate was white. So popular was Mr.\r\n     Scurlock that he defeated his Democratic opponent at the polls by\r\n     a handsome majority and served out his term to the satisfaction\r\n     of his constituents.\r\n\r\n     In 1876 he was a delegate to the State Convention that nominated\r\n     the late Judge Settle for Governor and canvassed the State for\r\n     him. He was again a delegate to the State Convention in each\r\n     succeeding four years up to and including the year 1896. In the\r\n     latter year he headed the delegation. In the campaign of that\r\n     year, at the request of the State Executive Committee, he\r\n     canvassed 21 counties in the State for McKinley and Hobart, all\r\n     of which were carried for the Republican ticket. So pleased was\r\n     the Committee with the canvass he was making, he was highly\r\n     commended in letters from the Chairman while still canvassing.\r\n\r\n     In 1890 he was urged by leading Republicans of his district,\r\n     including such men as ex-Governor Brogden, to become the\r\n     Republican candidate for Congress. Long before the convention\r\n     convened it was evident that he was the strongest man in the\r\n     field. When the convention met and was organized, ex-Governor\r\n     Brogden took the platform and in a ringing speech paying a high\r\n     tribute to the subject of this sketch, placed him in nomination.\r\n     Before the end of the roll call of counties his nomination was\r\n     made unanimous. In his canvass for election he had the hearty\r\n     support of the State organization and many of the leading colored\r\n     and white Republicans in and without his district and State. In\r\n     1892 he was unanimously chosen as a delegate to the Republican\r\n     National Convention, which met in Minneapolis.\r\n\r\n     As far back as 1883 he was appointed a clerk in one of the\r\n     Departments at Washington by Secretary Teller. He held this\r\n     position until under a Democratic administration he was for\r\n     partisan reasons asked to resign. President Harrison, recognizing\r\n     his ability, appointed him Postmaster of his city, Fayetteville.\r\n\r\n     For more than 20 years he was a leader in the party and so\r\n     recognized by the late Judge Buxton and such men as the late\r\n     ex-Congressman O. H. Dockery, and Judges Boyd and Pritchard, now\r\n     on the bench. Outside his State his ability as an organizer and\r\n     canvasser was recognized by Hon. J.S. Clarkson and the late\r\n     William E. Chandler and M.S. Quay.\r\n\r\nIn a letter of April 8, 1919, Bishop N.H. Heard says:\r\n\r\n     I was born and raised in Elbert County, Georgia (born a slave),\r\n     June 25th, 1850. I taught school in '69, 70, '71, and '72. Was a\r\n     candidate for the Legislature of Georgia in 1872. Attorney\r\n     General Amos J. Ackerman, of Grant's Cabinet, was in the\r\n     convention that nominated me, and he canvassed and voted for me.\r\n     In 1873 I went to Abbeville County, S.C., and taught '73, '74,\r\n     and '75. Was Deputy U.S. Marshall in 1876 and elected to the\r\n     South Carolina Legislature.\r\n\r\nMr. M.N. Work has discovered the following:\r\n\r\n     In the ten years 1876-1886, Negroes were elected to the South\r\n     Carolina Legislature as Democrats. The Columbia (South Carolina)\r\n     State in its issue of December 24, 1918, advised that an effort\r\n     be made to have Negroes enroll in Democratic precinct clubs and\r\n     participate in the primaries of the State along with white men.\r\n     As a precedent for this, it was pointed out that: \"In 1876 when\r\n     the Democrats redeemed the State from misrule, they appealed to\r\n     the Negroes to join their party, and a minority of Negroes, more\r\n     numerous, perhaps than is generally supposed, wore the 'red\r\n     shirt.' Many of them did valuable service in behalf of\r\n     respectable government. During the ten years following that time,\r\n     until the primary election took the place of the convention\r\n     system in all but two or three of the counties, the Democratic\r\n     Negroes were given political recognition. From Barnwell,\r\n     Colleton, Orangeburg, and Charleston Negro Democrats were elected\r\n     to the legislature and in a number of counties other Negroes were\r\n     elected to such offices as coroner and county commissioner.\r\n\r\n     \"With the extension of the primary system a racial line came to\r\n     be drawn in the Democratic organization and it was made very\r\n     nearly impossible for a Negro to participate in it. An exception\r\n     in the party law provided that Negroes who voted for General\r\n     Hampton in 1876 and who continued to vote the Democratic ticket\r\n     in succeeding years be allowed to vote in the primaries, but the\r\n     rules applying to these cases were in a form so rigid that they\r\n     reduced the Negro Democratic vote.\"[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Columbia State, December 24, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUMMARY OF NEGRO MEMBERS OF SOME RECONSTRUCTION LEGISLATURES\r\n\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: The following two tables were published as\r\n     one large, wide table.

GRAY BEFORE THE ARKANSAS CONSTITUTIONAL\r\nCONVENTION, 1868[1]\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Gray, a Negro, and delegate to the convention from Phillips\r\nCounty, rose and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"It appears to me, the gentleman has read the history of his\r\n     country to little purpose. When the Constitution was framed, in\r\n     every State but South Carolina free Negroes were allowed to vote.\r\n     Under British rule this class was free, and he interpreted that\r\n     'we the people' in the preamble of the Constitution, meant all\r\n     the people of every color. The mistake of that period was that\r\n     these free Negroes were not represented _in propria persona_ in\r\n     that constitutional convention, but by the Anglo-Saxon. Congress\r\n     is now correcting that mistake. The right of franchise is due the\r\n     Negroes bought by the blood of forty thousand of their race shed\r\n     in three wars. The troubles now on the country are the result of\r\n     the bad exercise of the elective franchise by unintelligent\r\n     whites, the 'poor whites' of the South. I could duplicate every\r\n     Negro who cannot read and write, whose name is on the list of\r\n     registered voters, with a white man equally ignorant. The\r\n     gentleman can claim to be a friend of the Negro, but I do not\r\n     desire to be looked upon in the light of a client. The Government\r\n     has made a solemn covenant with the Negro to vest him with the\r\n     right of franchise if he would throw his weight in the balance in\r\n     favor of the Union and bare his breast to the storm of bullets;\r\n     and I am convinced that it would not go back on itself. There are\r\n     thirty-two million whites to four million blacks in the country,\r\n     and there need be no fear of Negro domination. The State laws do\r\n     not protect the Negro in his rights, as they forbade their\r\n     entrance into the State. (Action of loyal convention of '64). I\r\n     am not willing to trust the rights of my people with the white\r\n     men, as they have not preserved those of their own race, in\r\n     neglecting to provide them with the means of education. The\r\n     Declaration of Independence declared all men born free and equal,\r\n     and I demand the enforcement of that guarantee made to my\r\n     forefathers, to every one of each race, who had fought for it.\r\n     The constitution which this ordinance would reenact it not\r\n     satisfactory, as it is blurred all over with the word 'white.'\r\n     Under it one hundred and eleven thousand beings who live in the\r\n     State have no rights which white men are bound to respect. My\r\n     people might be ignorant, but I believe, with Jefferson, that\r\n     ignorance is no measure of a man's rights. Slavery has been\r\n     abolished, but it left my people in a condition of peonage or\r\n     caste worse than slavery, which had its humane masters. White\r\n     people should look to their own ancestry; they should recollect\r\n     that women were disposed of on the James River, in the early\r\n     settlement of the country, as wives, at the price of two hundred\r\n     pounds of tobacco. When we have had eight hundred years as the\r\n     whites to enlighten ourselves, it will be time enough to\r\n     pronounce them incapable of civilization and enlightenment. The\r\n     last election showed that they were intelligent enough to vote in\r\n     a solid mass with the party that would give them their rights,\r\n     and that too in face of the influence of the intelligence and\r\n     wealth of the State, and in face of threats to take the bread\r\n     from their very mouths. I have no antipathy toward the whites; I\r\n     would drop the curtain of oblivion on the sod which contains the\r\n     bones of my oppressed and wronged ancestors for two hundred and\r\n     fifty years. Give us the franchise, and if we do not exercise it\r\n     properly, you have the numbers to take it away from us. It would\r\n     be impossible for the Negro to get justice in a State whereof he\r\n     was not a full citizen. The prejudice of the entire court would\r\n     be against him. I do not expect the Negro to take possession of\r\n     the government; I want the franchise given him as an incentive to\r\n     work to educate his children. I do not desire to discuss the\r\n     question of the inferiority of races. Unpleasant truths must then\r\n     be told; history tells us of your white ancestors who lived on\r\n     the acorns which dropped from the oaks of Didona, and then\r\n     worshipped the tree as a God. I call upon all men who would see\r\n     justice done, to meet this question fairly, and fear not to\r\n     record their votes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the session of January 29th, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"Negroes vote in Ohio and Massachusetts, and in the latter State\r\n     are elected to high office by rich men. He had found more\r\n     prejudice against his race among the Yankees; and if they did him\r\n     a kind act, they did not seem to do it with the generous spirit\r\n     of Southern men. He could get nearer the latter; he had been\r\n     raised with them. He was the sorrier on this account that they\r\n     had refused him the rights which would make him a man, as the\r\n     former were willing to do. He wanted this a white man's\r\n     government, and wanted them to do the legislating as they had the\r\n     intelligence and wealth; but he wanted the power to protect\r\n     himself against unfriendly legislation. Justice should be like\r\n     the Egyptian statue, blind and recognizing no color.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning intermarriage between whites and Negroes, Mr. Bradley, a\r\ndelegate to the convention, having offered to insert in the\r\nconstitution, a clause \"forbidding matrimony between a white person\r\nand a person of African descent,\" on which point nearly all of the\r\nmembers spoke pro and con in that and the following days, Mr. Gray\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     \"It was seldom such outrages were committed at the North, where\r\n     there are no constitutional provisions of the kind proposed. He\r\n     saw no necessity of inserting any in the present constitution. As\r\n     for his people, their condition now would not permit any such\r\n     marriages. If it was proposed to insert a provision of the kind,\r\n     he would move to amend by making it an offence punishable with\r\n     death for a white man to cohabit with a Negro woman.\" At another\r\n     time he observed on the same subject, that \"there was no danger\r\n     of intermarriage, as the greatest minds had pronounced it\r\n     abhorrent to nature. The provision would not cover the case, as\r\n     the laws must subsequently define who is a Negro; and he referred\r\n     to the law of North Carolina, declaring persons Negroes who have\r\n     only one-sixteenth of Negro blood. White men had created the\r\n     difficulty, and it would not be impossible to draw the line which\r\n     the gentleman desired established.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Annual Cyclopedia, 1868, pp. 34-35.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Monroe N. Work, who compiled the records of the Negro in politics\r\nduring the Reconstruction period, has received the following\r\ninteresting letters containing some valuable facts:\r\n\r\n\r\n                 1425 MCCULLOH ST., BALTIMORE, MD., Feb. 9, 1920.\r\n\r\n     _My dear Mr. Work_:\r\n\r\n     Referring to the \"Journal of Negro History\" for Jan., 1920, in\r\n     the letter of the State Librarian of Virginia, page 119, occur\r\n     these words: \"_For the 1881-2 session the almanac has no list of\r\n     members._\"\r\n\r\n     It so happens that the writer was present, and was an employee of\r\n     that particular session of the Virginia Legislature, and\r\n     therefore takes pleasure in supplying the necessary information.\r\n\r\n     The speaker of the House of Representatives was the Hon. I.C.\r\n     Fowler, and the President protem (the Lieutenant Governor, John\r\n     F. Lewis, being President) of the Senate was the Hon. H.C. Wood.\r\n     The Governor of the State at that time was the Hon. William E.\r\n     Cameron, from my home town, Petersburg. It was quite a memorable\r\n     session, and I could almost write a book, with respect to matters\r\n     as they pertained to the Negro. The Hon. William Mahone was\r\n     United States Senator, and although a boy, I was much trusted by\r\n     Senator Mahone; and in many important conferences held in the old\r\n     \"Whig\" building, I was quite active in helping to prevent none\r\n     but \"the faithful\" from entering.\r\n\r\n     Upon the assembling of the Legislature, I was appointed one of\r\n     the six pages in the House. The other five were white boys. Very\r\n     soon afterwards, I was promoted to the postmastership of the\r\n     House. On the Senate side, there were two colored boys as pages,\r\n     a son of ex-Senator Moseley of Goochland Co., and a son of the\r\n     late R.G.L. Paige, representative from Norfolk county.\r\n\r\n     There were three colored men in the Senate Chamber, and two of\r\n     them were really able and scholarly men, and were among the\r\n     leading debaters in that chamber. One was Dr. Dan Norton, from\r\n     the Yorktown District, another was Senator William N. Stevens,\r\n     representing the senatorial district of Sussex and Greensville\r\n     counties. Senator Stevens was a speaker of much elegance and\r\n     grace, and was always listened to with respect and admiration.\r\n     Then there was Senator J. Richard Jones, representing Charlotte\r\n     and Mecklenburg counties.\r\n\r\n     In the Lower House, there were thirteen colored representatives;\r\n     the names of two I can not just recall, but the others I will\r\n     mention.\r\n\r\n          Norfolk county, R.G.L. Paige.\r\n          Princess Anne county, Littleton Owens.\r\n          York county, Robert Norton.\r\n          City of Petersburg, Armstead Green.\r\n          Dinwiddie county, Alfred W. Harris.\r\n          Powhatan county, Neverson Lewis.\r\n          Brunswick county, Guy Powell.\r\n          Cumberland county, Shed Dungee.\r\n          Prince Edward county, Batt Greggs.\r\n          Amelia and Nottoway, Archie Scott.\r\n          Mecklenburg county, Ross Hamilton.\r\n\r\n     Paige and Harris were thoroughly educated men, while Ross\r\n     Hamilton possessing only limited literary qualifications, was a\r\n     most remarkable man, and one of the parliamentary authorities of\r\n     that body. In the preceding session, of which Hamilton was a\r\n     member, he got to himself great fame by the introduction of the\r\n     measure known and referred to as the \"Ross Hamilton bill.\" It\r\n     had to do with the settlement of the Virginia debt, the great\r\n     issue on which Mahone rode into power.\r\n\r\n     Paige and Harris were among the principal leaders of the House,\r\n     and certainly, few were the men in that house whether democrats\r\n     or republicans, who could outrank them in oratory or public\r\n     debate.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Harris introduced the measure which provided for the present\r\n     state Normal school, at Petersburg, carrying with it an\r\n     appropriation of one hundred thousand dollars. I had the great\r\n     pleasure of bearing the bill to the Speaker's desk.\r\n\r\n     During the session of this Legislature two colored men were given\r\n     clerkships at the capitol: young Bob Norton, whose father\r\n     represented York, in that body, was given a place in the General\r\n     Land Office, while Richard De Baptist, of Mecklenburg county, was\r\n     given a desk in the 2nd Auditor's office. A white physician, Dr.\r\n     David F. May, of Petersburg, was made Superintendent of the\r\n     Central Lunatic Asylum, for colored people, his two assistants\r\n     being colored physicians, Dr. J.C. Ferguson, of Richmond, and Dr.\r\n     R.F. Tancil, of Alexandria. A number of colored men were put on\r\n     as guards at the State Penitentiary. Capt. R.A. Paul, of\r\n     Richmond, was made private messenger to the Governor. So numerous\r\n     were the places filled by colored men, that that particular\r\n     period, and the one that followed, have been indicated in the\r\n     phrase, having a political bearing: \"When they lived, they lived\r\n     in clover: but, when they died, they died all over.\"\r\n\r\n     Those were thrilling times. I remember, a year or two later, when\r\n     I had just become of age, I was elected a delegate to the State\r\n     Convention, which was held in the old Richmond Theater on Broad\r\n     St. There were over thirteen hundred delegates, only about a\r\n     fifth being colored. The writer was elected the first assistant\r\n     secretary of that gathering. That convention marked the passing\r\n     of the \"re-adjuster\" party into the Republican, and, under the\r\n     dominance of Senator Mahone, the slogan of the Convention was,\r\n     \"We are for Arthur, because Arthur is for us.\" I hope that what I\r\n     have thus very hurriedly written may prove of some value to you\r\n     in the preservation of the annals of Virginia as respects the\r\n     black man.\r\n\r\n                              Respectfully yours,\r\n                                  (Signed) GEORGE FREEMAN BRAGG, JR.\r\n\r\n     P.S. I want to correct a statement. There were two of us in the\r\n     Lower House. Clinton Paige, and myself, were in the lower\r\n     chamber, and Moseley on the Senate side. I began my first work of\r\n     the ministry in Norfolk in 1887, and about that time the Hon.\r\n     R.G.L. Paige was appointed Postmaster of Norfolk City. He really\r\n     ran the office. I have spent many a pleasant moment with him in\r\n     his office there. It will be interesting to state just here, that\r\n     \"Dick\" Paige made his escape from Norfolk by way of the Under\r\n     Ground Railroad, only a little fellow of nine or ten years of\r\n     age, secreting himself in a vessel leaving that port. He was\r\n     educated in Boston. After the civil war he returned to Norfolk.\r\n\r\n     Round about the same time that I took charge in Norfolk, John C.\r\n     Asbury, now of Philadelphia, was practising law in Norfolk Co.\r\n     and city. Norfolk county is one of the largest and richest\r\n     counties in the State. Asbury was elected by the voters of that\r\n     county Prosecuting Attorney, and to my own knowledge, he most\r\n     acceptably filled the office during the term of four years, I\r\n     think, for which he was elected. He was recognized as one of the\r\n     able political leaders of that section. Captain Fields was\r\n     elected and served as Commonwealth's Attorney of Newport News and\r\n     Warwick county. Rev. J. M. Dawson was the county treasurer where\r\n     the ancient capital Williamsburg is situated, while a Mr.\r\n     Mitchell, for a number of years was the Collector of Customs for\r\n     the historic port of Yorktown.\r\n\r\n                              (Signed) G.

WORK,\r\n       Tuskegee, Ala.\r\n\r\n     _My dear Mr. Work_:\r\n\r\n     I have perused with considerable interest your review of the\r\n     political history of the Reconstruction period. I have gotten\r\n     from the review quite a bit of useful information. In my opinion,\r\n     this particular part of your research work should be in the hands\r\n     of every Negro in America that every Negro child might know\r\n     something of the early exploits of colored men.\r\n\r\n     As a pointer for further work I want to state that succeeding\r\n     Phil. Joiner of Dougherty County, Georgia, Ishmael London\r\n     represented that county. J.H. Watson of Albany could furnish\r\n     detail information. Jack Horne of Pulaski County was Clerk of the\r\n     Court of Pulaski County and Richard White was Clerk of Chatham\r\n     County Court during the period under discussion. Mrs. Hannah\r\n     Benefield or Mr. Edward Cary of Hawkinsville will give authentic\r\n     information regarding the former and P.A. Denegall will furnish\r\n     information regarding \"Dick\" White.\r\n\r\n     We are pleased to follow you in your statistical ramblings\r\n     because we love to connect you with us here and to recall your\r\n     presence among us. We cherish very deeply your memory and applaud\r\n     your efforts for racial uplift.\r\n\r\n     The madam joins me in wishing for you a long and useful career--a\r\n     happy and prosperous one.\r\n\r\n                              Respectfully,\r\n                                   (Signed) E.

WATSON,\r\n         Albany, Georgia.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir_:\r\n\r\n     As you may already know, I have been for a considerable time\r\n     collecting information about the colored persons who were members\r\n     of State Legislatures during the reconstruction period. A list of\r\n     these members as far as I have been able to collect them was\r\n     published in the January number of the \"Journal of Negro\r\n     History.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. E.W. Sherman of Savannah, Georgia, after reading my article,\r\n     wrote to me that Phil Joiner, Dougherty County, was succeeded by\r\n     Ishmael London. He stated that you could give me further\r\n     information concerning this. Will you not, as Mr. Sherman\r\n     suggests, send to me the names of all of the colored men whom you\r\n     know to have represented Dougherty County in the Georgia\r\n     Legislature and as near as you can, the date that they were\r\n     members of the Legislature.\r\n\r\n     Thanking you in advance for your courtesy and appreciating an\r\n     early reply, I am\r\n\r\n                              Yours very truly,\r\n                                       M.

In Thomas County, Rev.

MONROE WORK,\r\n         Tuskegee, Alabama.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\n     I am in receipt of yours of 14th inst., seeking information\r\n     relative to the occupancy of the clerkship of Chatham Superior\r\n     Court, by the late Richard W. White, during reconstruction\r\n     period.\r\n\r\n     In reply I beg to say, that at the period, about which you desire\r\n     information, I was too young a boy to have any adequate or\r\n     understanding knowledge of the political affairs or status of\r\n     that period, so that I have no first hand knowledge of the matter\r\n     upon which you desire information. All I know about the late Mr.\r\n     White's clerkship is only what I gleaned in conversation with my\r\n     father, and as he paid no special attention to dates, simply\r\n     telling me of things taking place during reconstruction, I have\r\n     only by that means, knowledge of some things without the dates of\r\n     their occurance.\r\n\r\n     I am very sorry I cannot give you the information you desire, I\r\n     should be glad to do so if I could.\r\n\r\n     May I add that I have read your article in the January \"_Journal\r\n     of Negro History_\" on \"Some Negro members of reconstruction\r\n     conventions and legislatures.\" I note that the name of the late\r\n     Prof. John McIntosh, late principal of Mape St. School of this\r\n     city is omitted from the list of colored members of Georgia\r\n     legislature. He was a member of the Georgia House of\r\n     Representatives, representing Liberty County in the \"80's\" a few\r\n     years after his graduation from Atlanta University. As far as I\r\n     know he was the most thoroughly educated colored man to have had\r\n     the privilege of being a member of the Georgia Legislature. I\r\n     knew him intimately. We were pupils at Beach Institute, this city\r\n     at the same time, later fellow students at Atlanta University.\r\n     Again regretting that I am not able to give the desired\r\n     information, I am\r\n\r\n                              Very truly yours,\r\n                                         Signed--\r\n                                              P.

WORK,\r\n       Tuskegee Institute\r\n         Alabama.\r\n\r\n     _My dear Sir_:\r\n\r\n     I have read with keen interest the facts presented by you in the\r\n     Journal of Negro History for January 1920 on \"Some Negro Members\r\n     of Reconstruction Conventions etc.\"\r\n\r\n     I have known intimately Gen. Samuel Smalls and his family in\r\n     Beaufort, S.C. and Miss Olive Rainey and her mother, daughter and\r\n     wife of Joseph H. Rainey; Miss Mamie Hayne of S.C. daughter of\r\n     Henry E. Hayne.\r\n\r\n     One daughter of Gen. Smalls still lives in the paternal home in\r\n     Beaufort, where are the books and personal possessions of her\r\n     distinguished father. She was companion and house-keeper for him\r\n     in his late years; she is doubtless able to furnish much valuable\r\n     information.\r\n\r\n     Brothers of Henry E. Hayne still live, though they do not\r\n     identify themselves with the Negro race. The daughter does,\r\n     however, and has friends of her father's generation who could\r\n     help in building up a Hayne's history.\r\n\r\n     Among the relatives is the mother of my husband and a large\r\n     family of relatives, the older ones of whom lived thro'\r\n     Reconstruction Days in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n     Miss Rainey and her mother live in Springfield, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n     My own family on the maternal side is descended from George\r\n     Houston, member of the Alabama Legislature 1868-70.\r\n\r\n     I have long felt that the last opportunity to collect data\r\n     concerning this interesting period in our history, is while this\r\n     present generation lives; the next generation will have no\r\n     interest in it.\r\n\r\n     If I can assist you in collecting facts from these people who\r\n     knew intimately the men of whom you write, I should be glad to do\r\n     so.\r\n\r\n     I feel that the best way to do this would be for you to send me a\r\n     set of questionnaires which I might send to these friends with\r\n     letters.\r\n\r\n     I am trying thro' the Department of Archives and History of\r\n     Alabama and the Congressional Library to locate material which\r\n     will illuminate the life of George Houston.\r\n\r\n     If what I have written is of interest to you, then I am glad that\r\n     I have written. And can I be of assistance, I shall be glad to\r\n     make further contribution if possible.\r\n\r\n                                 Sincerely,\r\n                                      (Signed) HELEN JAMES CHISHOLM,\r\n     MRS.

I think that\r\n     the publication is gaining a position in its particular field\r\n     which promises to make it an accepted authority on historical\r\n     questions. This makes it the more essential for manifest errors\r\n     to be carefully guarded against and eliminated from contributed\r\n     articles.\r\n\r\n     I observe on page 5 the designation \"Tillston College\" of The\r\n     American Missionary Association; the correct name is Tillotson\r\n     College, for the institution at Austin, Texas. The footnote gives\r\n     _Brawley_ as authority. I do not have this book at hand but have\r\n     a suspicion that the erroneous spelling is found there also.\r\n\r\n     Another statement in the same article which seems to me erroneous\r\n     in a more serious matter is found at the bottom of page 4, where\r\n     it is assumed that in 1863 \"only 5 per cent of the Negro\r\n     population was literate.\" In your book on _The Education of the\r\n     Negro Prior to 1861_ you have stated very solid reasons for\r\n     believing 10 per cent to be about the right estimate. This\r\n     accords also with the U.S. Census figures of 1870, set forth in a\r\n     table of which I sent you a copy. Is it not a matter of vital\r\n     significance to our American history which of these statements is\r\n     to be accepted? Yesterday I saw posted on the wall of a New Haven\r\n     church the statement of _5 per cent_. It used to be considered\r\n     allowable to make wild statements on this subject when presenting\r\n     the claims of Southern education. Indeed I have known the\r\n     statement to be made in such a connection, that _none_ of the\r\n     Negroes could read or write before the war. I yield to no one in\r\n     my estimate of the importance of the work of Northern teachers\r\n     and Northern schools in the education of the colored people. But\r\n     their value is not magnified by such exaggerated and reckless\r\n     over-statement. Rather is it brought under serious question and\r\n     damaging suspicion.\r\n\r\n     You have done and are still doing most valuable work in the\r\n     interest of historical accuracy, and to clear away the fogs of\r\n     misconstruction and misapprehension concerning the Negro people\r\n     which have prevailed for at least a hundred years. I could wish\r\n     that you might see your way as an editor to insist on alteration\r\n     in a manuscript containing such a misstatement, or at least add\r\n     an editorial comment on the point.\r\n\r\n     Wishing for your _Journal_ continued and increasing circulation\r\n     and popular support, I remain,\r\n\r\n                              Faithfully, yours,\r\n                                    G. S. DICKERMAN.\r\n\r\nThe editor made the following reply:\r\n\r\n                                             February 28 1920.\r\n\r\n     DR. G. S.

You insist that, prior to the\r\n     emancipation of the race, more than five per cent of the Negro\r\n     population was literate, and refer to my _Education of the Negro\r\n     Prior to 1861_ to support you in that statement. You must\r\n     observe, however, that I maintain that ten per cent of the adult\r\n     Negroes had the rudiments of education. It might, therefore, be\r\n     possible for some one to prove that less than ten per cent of the\r\n     whole Negro population was at that time able to read and write.\r\n\r\n     Thanking you for your interest in this work, I am\r\n\r\n                              Yours very truly,\r\n                                      C.

CARTER G. WOODSON,\r\n       1216 You Street, N.W.\r\n         Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Dr. Woodson:_\r\n\r\n     In preparing a chapter on The History of Negro Education for Dr.\r\n     Jones, of the Phelps Stokes Foundation, I made a study of the\r\n     Ninth Census and prepared a table of figures which I suggested\r\n     for publication in a foot note. But my manuscript was so long\r\n     that it was thought best to eliminate about a third of it and\r\n     this table with much besides.\r\n\r\n     I have therefore thrown this Census study into form for\r\n     publication in an article by itself. If you like you may have it\r\n     for _Journal of Negro History_. Of course the Census is not\r\n     infallible and the Ninth Census has been especially charged with\r\n     inaccuracy. But it certainly has some meaning, and I think the\r\n     confirmation of your conclusions is worth noticing.\r\n\r\n     If you do not wish to use the article please return it to the\r\n     above address.\r\n\r\n                              Very truly yours,\r\n                                      G. S. DICKERMAN.\r\n\r\n               THE NINTH CENSUS ON NEGRO ILLITERACY\r\n\r\n    The treatise of Dr. Carter Godwin Woodson on _The Education of the\r\n    Negro Prior to 1861_ offers an impressive array of evidence to\r\n    show that there were many more Negroes than have usually been\r\n    supposed who had some literary knowledge while still under\r\n    slavery. Other evidence bearing on a subject of so great\r\n    importance cannot but have interest for historians of that period.\r\n\r\n    Some of the statistics in the United States Census of 1870 are in\r\n    point: Figures are there given for the colored men of voting age,\r\n    that is for those over 21, who were unable to read and write.\r\n    There are also given the total numbers of colored men of voting\r\n    age in the several States. Subtracting the former from the latter\r\n    will then give the number of those able to read and write. The\r\n    results appear in the table presented below:\r\n\r\n    COLORED MALES 21 YEARS OF AGE AND UPWARD IN 1870; WITH REFERENCE\r\n    TO THEIR ABILITY TO WRITE\r\n\r\n     =====================+===========+===========+=========+==========\r\n                          |           | Unable to | Able to | Per Cent\r\n                          |  Total    |   Write   |  Write  |   Able\r\n     ---------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+----------\r\n     United States        | 1,032,475 | 862,243   | 170,232 |  16.5\r\n     Southern States      |   932,612 | 820,670   | 111,942 |  12.0\r\n     All other states     |    99,863 |  41,573   |  58,290 |  58.4\r\n     ---------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+----------\r\n     Alabama              |    97,823 |   91,017  |   6,806 |   6.9\r\n     Arkansas             |    26,789 |   23,681  |   3,108 |  11.6\r\n     District of Columbia |    10,143 |    7,599  |   2,544 |  25.1\r\n     Florida              |    18,842 |   16,806  |   2,036 |  10.8\r\n     Georgia              |   107,962 |  100,551  |   7,411 |   6.9\r\n     Kentucky             |    44,322 |   37,889  |   6,432 |  14.5\r\n     Louisiana            |    86,911 |   76,612  |  10,301 |  11.7\r\n     Maryland             |    39,123 |   27,123  |  11,997 |  30.6\r\n     Mississippi          |    89,920 |   80,810  |   9,116 |  10.1\r\n     Missouri             |    23,886 |   18,002  |   5,880 |  24.6\r\n     North Carolina       |    78,012 |   68,669  |   9,350 |  12.0\r\n     South Carolina       |    85,475 |   70,830  |  14,645 |  17.1\r\n     Tennessee            |    64,131 |   55,938  |   8,193 |  12.8\r\n     Texas                |    51,575 |   47,235  |   4,340 |   8.4\r\n     Virginia             |   107,691 |   97,908  |   9,783 |   9.1\r\n     ---------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+----------\r\n\r\n    This Census gives the figures for women of color over 21 years of\r\n    age who were unable to write; but not the whole number of women of\r\n    color over 21. If however we assume the proportion of all Negro\r\n    males to all Negro females to hold the same for those over 21 we\r\n    arrive at the conclusion that the whole number of women of color\r\n    over 21 was 1,072,847 for the United States; of whom 946,332 were\r\n    unable to write and 126,515 were able. That is, in 1870, there\r\n    were approximately 126,515 women of color of 21 years of age and\r\n    upward who were able to read and write. This number added to the\r\n    170,232, found for the number of literate men, gives a total of\r\n    296,747 Negroes of 21 years of age and upward who were able to\r\n    read and write; which is 14 per cent of the whole number. There\r\n    must have been a considerable increase between 1863 and 1870, but\r\n    one can hardly suppose it to have been over 4 per cent, or 84,212,\r\n    which substantiates the estimate of about 10 per cent of the\r\n    Negroes as able to read and write at the date of emancipation. We\r\n    may suppose that the number of those who were able to read, but\r\n    did not add to this the accomplishment of writing, must have been\r\n    much larger.\r\n\r\n    The existence of so large a body of Negroes who already had the\r\n    rudiments of an education goes far to account for the rapid growth\r\n    of schools as soon as the Negroes were made free, and especially\r\n    for that eagerness that was shown for advanced learning which\r\n    made an almost immediate demand for secondary schools and colleges\r\n    at the more important centers of population throughout the South.\r\n    The people had received, in some way or other, a love of education\r\n    and a start in obtaining it under the old slave system, so that\r\n    when the new chance came they were ready to make a good use of it.\r\n\r\n                                             G. S. DICKERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK REVIEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The Centennial History of Illinois, Volume III. The Era of the\r\n     Civil War 1848-1870._ By ARTHUR CHARLES COLE. The Illinois\r\n     Centennial Commission, Springfield, Illinois, 1919.\r\n\r\nThis volume of this work deals with the period of the most dramatic\r\nhistory of the State. After discussing the frontier and the rise of\r\nrailroads, the author directs his attention to the agitation and\r\ncompromise of 1850, the origin of the Republican party, the\r\nLincoln-Douglass Debates, the election of 1860, the appeal to arms,\r\nthe war in Illinois, new abolitionists and copperheads, and the war in\r\nits relation to agriculture and the industrial revolution. The book is\r\nillustrated with such portraits as those of Abraham Lincoln, Stephen\r\nA. Douglass, Lyman Trumbull and Richard Yates. There are maps showing\r\nthe foreign-born population in 1860, the presidential election in\r\n1848, the vote for treasurer in 1854, the vote for congressmen in\r\n1858, the vote on the constitution in 1862, the vote for\r\ncongressmen-at-large in 1860, and the presidential election in 1868.\r\nThe volume closes with an adequate bibliography and a useful index.\r\n\r\nAs a book on the Civil War is not uncommon, one does not ordinarily\r\nexpect many things new from such a volume inasmuch as most of them\r\ncover familiar ground. In connecting the history of Illinois with the\r\nnational drama of Civil War, however, the author has brought forward\r\nfacts which, although belonging to local history, have a national\r\nsignificance and historians will make use of them, although they will\r\nnot agree with him in all of his views. The scientific use which he\r\nhas made of the newspaper material of that day is especially\r\ncommendable. He has, moreover, shown that this history was as economic\r\nas political. Good farms and roads figured as conspicuously as\r\nefficient generals and wise statesmen.\r\n\r\nThere is some mention of the Negro as a human element. Sympathy for\r\nthe race, \"whether the southern slave or the northern victim of the\r\nblack laws, was aroused by _Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1852_.\" Thereafter\r\ncame the effort to secure for the blacks equal rights before the law\r\nbut because of opposition to them in southern Illinois the black code\r\ncould not be easily repealed, for race hatred often broke out in\r\nsouthern towns as in the case of Mound City, which in 1857 undertook\r\nto drive out all Negroes. The author mentions also such strivings of\r\nthe Negroes as the efforts of the members of the race in Chicago to\r\ndefend their rights by protesting against the oppression through local\r\nindignation meetings and the Colored National Convention in Cleveland\r\nin 1848. Their Chicago Literary Society condemned the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw, they organized to resist colonizationists and kidnappers, and at\r\nthe outbreak of the war organized a military force to fight for their\r\nown freedom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _The National Encyclopedia of the Colored Race._ Volume I. By\r\n     CLEMENT RICHARDSON, Editor-in-Chief. The National Publishing\r\n     Company, Montgomery, Alabama, 1919.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair effort at local and national biography with no pretense\r\nto scientific treatment. Some attention is given also to religious and\r\neducational institutions. Apparently almost any one financially able\r\nto aid the enterprise or sufficiently influential to have his sketch\r\nincorporated into the work appears in this volume. One man's\r\nachievements seemed to count for about as much as those of another and\r\nthe law of proportion was disregarded. There are farmers, business\r\nmen, ministers, physicians, dentists, lawyers and the like, many of\r\nwhom are well known and others who have made no impression upon the\r\nworld except to complete a course in an institution of learning and to\r\nuse the knowledge thus acquired in making a living. The world has\r\nnever heard of some of them and they will, of course, thank the editor\r\nfor this publicity.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this work, according to the editor, is to inform and\r\ninspire. He complains that the ordinary work of this kind has merely\r\nhad information for its purpose. As the only sure hope the black\r\nAmerican can entertain for immediate notice comes through committing\r\ncrime, the editor here endeavors to treat the records of a large\r\nnumber of Negroes who, because of their color, would never have a\r\nhearing. The aim of the book too is not only to inform the white race\r\nbut it is to introduce Negroes to one another. To be properly inspired\r\nthey need to be better informed as to what the ambitious members of\r\nthe race are doing in their various fields of endeavor. An effort is\r\nmade to get away from former biographical works largely given to\r\neulogy of individuals unduly advertised. The aim seems rather to\r\nidealize the life of obscure men, who have achieved merit in applying\r\nthemselves to the ordinary duties of life. Referring to the failure\r\nto treat more extensively the biographical material of the whole race\r\nthe editor states that such accounts cannot be secured in many\r\ninstances for the reason that, some are indifferent to fame,\r\nexperience a shrinking from publicity, or are too busy to give\r\nattention to matters of this kind. The defects of this book, however,\r\ncannot be excused on this ground.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the book has a value. It is fairly well printed, is\r\nadequately illustrated, and is readable. Although much of the\r\ninformation given is not now uninteresting it will in the course of\r\ntime serve as a valuable source book.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _The Man Next Door._ By A. B. JACKSON, M.D. Neaula Publishing\r\n     Company, Philadelphia, Pa., 1919. Pp. 253.\r\n\r\nThis is another work on the much mooted question, the Negro problem.\r\nThere was in the mind of the author some doubt as to whether or not he\r\nshould make an apology for adding another such work to the many\r\nvolumes written in this field. Observing, however, that the\r\ndiscussions of the race problem have in the past done some good as\r\nwell as harm, he here endeavors to present an up-to-date discussion\r\nfrom a new point of view in order to conform with the exigencies of\r\nthe day. The aim is to direct special attention to the failure to\r\nrecognize the Negro as a human asset with untold economic\r\npossibilities. He believes that the matter of race values and\r\ninterdependency of all races must find \"a definite and assuredly\r\npositive place in the various policies of any nation which is made up\r\nof several race groups.\" In one sense the author believes that \"racial\r\nconflict, strife and differences inspiring as they do, struggle,\r\njealousy, and ambition, are essential to the progress of the whole\r\ngroup of mankind.\" He insists, however, that struggle should be a\r\nfriendly rivalry out of which shall be woven a strong and everlasting\r\nnational fabric consistent with impressing and assuring the\r\nperpetuation of the various policies which guarantee national honor\r\nand uplift.\r\n\r\nThe author believes that the one great hope for the Negro is to make\r\nhimself an economic asset to his country. When this is accomplished,\r\nthere will be little doubt as to the possibility of his securing full\r\nrecognition as a citizen. He does not deplore the presence of\r\nobstacles but rather thinks that the salvation of the race will be in\r\ndeveloping in the midst of this struggle the power to overcome these\r\nobstacles. It is suggested that the discussion of these matters\r\nshould be dispassionate and efforts for adjustment should be based\r\nupon reason rather than upon sentiment. To show exactly how this can\r\nbe done the author has directed his attention to such questions as\r\ncitizenship, and patriotism, the producer and the consumer, the Negro\r\nand his church, and educational assets. The question is further\r\ntreated under such captions as race consciousness, health and\r\neconomics, tuberculosis a great waste, rent and ownership, and\r\nbusiness development. The book closes with observations on racial\r\ngrouping, political status, and the follies of prejudice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Darkwater._ By W. E. B. DUBOIS. Harcourt, Brace and Howe, New\r\n     York, 1920. Pp. 276.\r\n\r\nThis work is a collection of essays by the well-known author of _Souls\r\nof Black Folk_, _The Philadelphia Negro_, _The Suppression of the\r\nAfrican Slave Trade_, and _The Negro_. The aim of the work is to show\r\nthat the Negro problem is essentially connected with the problem of\r\nwork or wages or education and government which, when solved, will\r\nmean also the solution of the race problem. To give his point of view,\r\nthe author, therefore, describes his childhood, training, and outlook\r\non the world as a Negro. To show the \"vast emotional content of the\r\nsocial problem, he has inserted between the chapters, bits of poetry\r\nand fancy which interpret the bewilderment, the disappointment, the\r\nlonging and the faith of millions of men. The work ends with a brief\r\nphilosophy of duty and death and a story and a hymn looking toward\r\nhuman unity.\r\n\r\nThis book, therefore, follows the trend of thought characteristic of\r\nDr. DuBois. As in the beautifully written essays entitled _Souls of\r\nBlack Folk_ he has here put himself forward as a person representative\r\nof millions of black men seriously suffering from social proscription.\r\nAlthough his contention that the race problem is interwoven with the\r\neconomic problems of the country is presented as the reason for\r\ndirecting more attention to this problem, the author does not treat\r\nthe race question from an economic point of view. This has been the\r\ndefect of the historical works which Dr. DuBois has written. He is at\r\nbest a popular essayist with a bit of poetic genius. In all of his\r\ndiscussions of the race problem his mind has not as yet been adequate\r\nto the task of scientific treatment of the question. _The Suppression\r\nof the African Slave Trade_ is a literary compilation or digest of\r\nState and national legislation to curb an evil, but it does not\r\nexhibit any relief or a unifying influence. _The Philadelphia Negro_\r\nis an ordinary report on social conditions which a local secretary of\r\nthe Urban League could now compile in almost any large city in about\r\nthree or six months and his _The Negro_ is merely a summary of a\r\nnumber of popular works setting forth such history of Africa as a few\r\ntravellers have been able to learn from the outside. It is hoped,\r\ntherefore, that Dr. DuBois will take his task more seriously that he\r\nmay finally write a scholarly economic treatise in this long neglected\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next annual meeting of the Association for the Study of Negro Life\r\nand History will convene in Washington, D. C., next November. All\r\ninstitutions interested in the teaching of Negro life and history will\r\nbe invited to send representatives to this meeting to confer as to the\r\nbest methods of prosecuting studies in this neglected field. The\r\nsession will cover two days to be devoted to addresses by the best\r\nthinkers of the country.

V--JULY, 1920--NO. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLAVE IN CANADA\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen engaged in a certain historical inquiry, I found occasion to\r\nexamine the magnificent collection of the Canadian Archives at Ottawa,\r\na collection which ought not to be left unexamined by anyone writing\r\non Canada. In that inquiry I discovered the proceedings in the case of\r\nChloe Cooley set out in Chapter V of the text. This induced me to make\r\nfurther researches on the subject of slavery in Upper Canada. The\r\nresult was incorporated in a paper, _The Slave in Upper Canada_, read\r\nbefore the Royal Society of Canada in May 1919, and subsequently\r\npublished in the JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY for October, 1919. Some of\r\nthe Fellows of the Royal Society of Canada and the editor of the\r\nJOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY have asked me to expand the paper. The\r\npresent work is the result.\r\n\r\nI have spent many happy hours in the Canadian Archives and have read\r\nall and copied most of the documents referred to in this book; but I\r\ncannot omit to thank the officers at Ottawa for their courtesy in\r\nforwarding my labor of love, in furnishing me with copies,\r\nphotographic and otherwise, and in unearthing interesting facts. It\r\nwill not be considered invidious if I mention William Smith, Esq.,\r\nI.S.O. and Miss Smillie, M.A., as specially helpful. My thanks are\r\nalso due to Messrs. Herrington, K.C., of Napanee, F. Landon, M.A., of\r\nLondon, Mrs. Hallam and Mrs. Seymour Corley of Toronto, General\r\nCruikshank of Ottawa, the Very Reverend Dean Raymond of Victoria, as\r\nwell as to many others of whose labors I have taken advantage. This\r\ngeneral acknowledgment will, I trust, be accepted in lieu of special\r\nand particular acknowledgment from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the Maritime Provinces is almost wholly taken from the\r\nReverend Dr. T. Watson Smith's paper on _Slavery in Canada_ in the\r\n_Nova Scotia Historical Society's Collections_, Vol. X, Halifax,\r\n1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE CONQUEST\r\n\r\n\r\nThat slavery existed in Canada before its conquest by Britain in\r\n1759-60, there can be no doubt, although curiously enough it has been\r\ndenied by some historians and essayists.[1] The first Negro slave of\r\nwhich any account is given was brought to Quebec by the English in\r\n1628. He was a young man from Madagascar and was sold in Quebec for 50\r\nhalf crowns.[2] Sixty years thereafter in 1688, Denonville, the\r\nGovernor and DeChampigny, the Intendant of New France, wrote to the\r\nFrench Secretary of State, complaining of the dearness and scarcity of\r\nlabor, agricultural and domestic, and suggesting that the best remedy\r\nwould be to have Negro slaves. If His Majesty would agree to that\r\ncourse, some of the principal inhabitants would have some bought in\r\nthe West Indies on the arrival of the Guinea ships. The minister\r\nreplied in 1689 in a note giving the King's consent but drawing\r\nattention to the danger of the slaves coming from so different a\r\nclimate dying in Canada and thereby rendering the experiment of no\r\navail.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Indians were accustomed to make use of slaves, generally if not\r\nuniversally of those belonging to other tribes: and the French\r\nCanadians frequently bought Indian slaves from the aborigines. These\r\nwere called \"Panis.\"[4] It would seem that a very few Indians were\r\ndirectly enslaved by the inhabitants: but the chief means of acquiring\r\nPanis was purchase from _les sauvages_.\r\n\r\nThe property in slaves was well recognized in International Law. We\r\nfind that in the Treaty of Peace and Neutrality in America signed at\r\nLondon, November 16, 1686,[5] between the Kings of France and England,\r\nwhich James II had arranged shortly after attaining the throne,\r\nArticle 10 provides that the subjects of neither nation should take\r\naway the savage inhabitants, or their slaves or the goods which the\r\nsavages had taken belonging to the subjects of either nation, and that\r\nthey should give no assistance or protection to such raids and\r\npillage. In 1705 it was decided that Negroes in America were\r\n\"moveables,\" meubles, corresponding in substance to what is called\r\n\"personal property\" in the English law.[6] This decision was on the\r\n_Coutume de Paris_, the law of New France.\r\n\r\nThe Panis and Negro slaves were not always obedient. Jacques Raudot,\r\nthe Intendant, April 13, 1709, made an ordinance on \"the Subject of\r\nNegroes and Savages called Panis.\" In this he recited the advantage\r\nthe colony would acquire by certainty of ownership of the savages\r\ncalled Panis \"whose nation is far removed from this country\" and that\r\ncertainty could only be brought about through the Indians who capture\r\nthem in their homes and deal for the most part with the English of\r\nCarolina, but who sometimes in fact sell them to the Canadians who are\r\noften defrauded of considerable sums through an idea of liberty\r\ninspired in the Panis by those who do not buy,[7] so that almost daily\r\nthey leave their masters under the pretext that there are no slaves in\r\nFrance--that is not wholly true since in the islands of this Continent\r\nall the Negroes bought as such are regarded as slaves.\"\r\n\r\nThe further recital says that all the colonies should be on the same\r\nfooting, and that the Panis were as necessary for the Canadians for\r\nthe cultivation of the land and other work as the Negroes were for the\r\nislands, that it was necessary to assure the property in their\r\npurchases those who have bought and those who should buy in the\r\nfuture. Then comes the enactment \"Nous sous le bon plaisir de Sa\r\nMajeste ordonnons, que tous les Panis et Negres qui ont ete achetes et\r\nqui le seront dans la suite, appartiendront en pleine propriete a ceux\r\nqui les ont achetes comme etant leurs esclaves.\" \"We with the consent\r\nof His Majesty enact that all the Panis and Negroes who heretofore\r\nhave been or who hereafter shall be bought shall be the absolute\r\nproperty as their slaves of those who bought them.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThis ordinance was not a dead letter. On February 8, 1734, Gilles\r\nHocquart, the Intendant at Quebec issued an ordinance in which he\r\nrecited that in 1732 Captain Joanne of the Navy brought a Carib slave\r\nof his to Canada and employed him as a sailor; that he had deserted\r\nwhen Captain Joanne was ready to embark for the West Indies; and that\r\nthe master had seen and recognized him a short time theretofore in the\r\nParish of St. Augustine but on reclaiming him certain evil-disposed\r\npersons had facilitated his escape. The ordinance directed all\r\ncaptains and officers of the militia to give their assistance to the\r\nmaster in recovering the Carib slave and forbade all persons to\r\nconceal him or facilitate his escape on pain of fine or worse.[9]\r\n\r\nSlavery thereafter tended to expand. The Edict of October 1727\r\nconcerning the American islands and colonies and therefore including\r\nCanada in the preamble spoke of the islands and colonies being in a\r\ncondition to support a considerable navigation and commerce by the\r\nconsumption and trade of Negroes, goods and merchandise, and the\r\nmeasures taken to furnish the necessary Negroes, goods and\r\nmerchandise. It was decreed that only such Negroes, goods, and\r\nmerchandise should be received by the islands and colonies as should\r\nbe brought in French bottoms. Very explicit and rigid regulations were\r\nmade to that end.\r\n\r\nSome of these slaves were too vindictive to be good servants. There is\r\ngiven by Abbe Gosselin in a paper in the _Transactions, Royal Society\r\nof Canada for 1900_, an account of a mutiny of part of the garrison at\r\nNiagara incited by a Panis probably in the service of an officer at\r\nthe post. Some of the mutineers were sentenced to death but made their\r\nescape while the Panis, Charles, was sent to Martinique with a request\r\nto the authorities to make him a slave and to take every precaution\r\nthat he should not escape to Canada or even to the English colonies. A\r\nfemale slave of color belonging to Mme. de Francheville who had been\r\nbought in the English Colonies set fire to her mistress' home the\r\nnight of the 10-11 April 1734, thus causing a conflagration which\r\ndestroyed a part of the city of Montreal. The unfortunate slave was\r\napprehended and tried for the crime then and for long after a capital\r\nfelony. Being found guilty, she was hanged June, 1734.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the number of slaves made necessary some regulation\r\nconcerning their liberation. September 1, 1736, Gilles Hocquart, the\r\nIntendant already mentioned, made an ordinance concerning the\r\nformalities requisite in the enfranchisement of slaves. Reciting that\r\nhe had been informed that certain persons in Canada had freed their\r\nslaves without any other formality than verbally giving them their\r\nliberty, and the necessity of fixing in an invariable manner the\r\nstatus of slaves who should be enfranchised, he ordered that for the\r\nfuture all enfranchisements should be by notarial act and that all\r\nother attempted enfranchisements should be null and void.\r\n\r\nSlaves unable to secure their freedom by legal means, however,\r\nundertook sometimes to effect the same by flight. A royal decree of\r\nJuly 23, 1745, recited the escape of three male and one female Negro\r\nslaves from the English West India Island of Antigua to the French\r\nIsland of Guadeloupe and there sold. There followed a decision of the\r\nSuperior Council of Guadeloupe that the proceeds of the sale belonged\r\nto the King of France and Negro slaves belonging to the enemy when\r\nthey came into a French colony became at once the property of His\r\nMajesty. To make clear the course to pursue for the future, the decree\r\ndeclared that Negro slaves who escape from enemy colonies into French\r\ncolonies and all they bring with them belong to His Majesty alone in\r\nthe same way as enemy ships and goods wrecked on his coasts.\r\n\r\nWith all of this security the ownership of slaves became common. In\r\nthe Registers of the Parish of La Longue Pointe is found the\r\ncertificate of the burial, March 13, 1755, of the body of Louise, a\r\nfemale Negro slave, aged 27 days, the property of M. Deschambault. In\r\nthe same Parish is found the certificate of baptism of Marie Judith, a\r\nPanis, about 12 years of age belonging to Sieur Preville of the same\r\nParish, November 4, 1756. On January 22, 1757, one Constant a Panis\r\nslave of Sieur de Saint Blain, officer of Infantry, is sentenced by de\r\nMonrepos, Lieutenant-Governor civil and criminal in the Jurisdiction\r\nof Montreal,[10] to the pillory in a public place on a market day and\r\nthen to perpetual banishment from the jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Canada begun at Quebec in 1759 and completed by the\r\nsurrender to Amherst of Montreal by de Vaudreuil in 1760 had some\r\nbearing on slavery. One of the Articles of Capitulation, the 47th,\r\nprovided that \"the Negroes and Panis of both Sexes shall remain in the\r\npossession of the French and Canadians to whom they belong; they shall\r\nbe at liberty to keep them in their service in the Colony or to sell\r\nthem: and they may also continue to bring them up in the Roman\r\nreligion.\"[11]\r\n\r\nHaving now reached the end of the French period, it will be well to\r\nsay a word as to the rights of the slaves. There is nowhere any\r\nintimation that there was any difference in that regard between the\r\nNegro and the Panis. The treatment of the latter by their fellow\r\nIndians depended upon the individual master. The Panis had no rights\r\nwhich his Indian master was bound to respect. Remembering the\r\npersistence of customs among uncivilized peoples, one may conclude\r\nthat the description given of slavery among the Chinook Indians about\r\na century later will probably not be far from the mark concerning the\r\nIndians of the earlier time and their slaves.\r\n\r\nPaul Kane, the celebrated explorer and artist,[12] in a paper read\r\nbefore the Canadian Institute[13] in 1857 said: \"Slavery is carried on\r\nto a great extent along the North-West Coast and in Vancouver Island\r\nand the Chinooks.... The inhabitants still retain a large number of\r\nslaves. These are usually procured from the Chastay Tribe who live\r\nnear the Umqua, a river south of the Columbia emptying into the\r\nPacific. They are sometimes seized by war-parties but are often bought\r\nfrom their own people.... Their slavery is of the most abject\r\ndescription: the Chinook men and women treat them with great severity\r\nand exercise the power of life and death at pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nKane gives shocking instances of this. He tells of a chief who\r\nsacrificed five slaves to a colossal wooden idol he had set up and\r\nsays that the unfortunate slaves were not considered entitled even to\r\nburial but their bodies were cast out to the crows and vultures.\r\n\r\nAmongst the French such an extreme of barbarity did not obtain. Their\r\nlaw was based upon the civil law, that is, the law of Rome, which in\r\nits developed form recognized the slave as a human being. The Roman\r\nworld was full of slaves. Not only were there slaves born but debtors\r\nsometimes sold themselves[14] or their children. The criminal might be\r\nenslaved. In early pagan times the slave had no rights. He was a\r\nchattel disposable according to the will of his master who had _jus\r\nvitae necisque_, who could slay, mutilate, scourge at pleasure.[15] In\r\nthe course of time this extreme power was restrained. Hadrian forbade\r\nthe killing of slaves, Marius allowed the slave to lay an information\r\nagainst his master. The prefect at Rome and the presidents of the\r\nprovinces took cognizance of crimes against the slave; and Constantine\r\nallowed a master to go free on killing his slave in chastisement only\r\nif he used rods or whips, but not if he used sticks, stones or\r\njavelins or tortured him to death.[16] Hard as was his lot, the\r\nunhappy slave had at least some rights in the later civil law, few\r\nand slight as they were, and these he had under the Coutume de Paris,\r\nthe law of French Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] For example in Garneau's _Histoire du Canada_ (1st Edit) Vol. 2,\r\np. 447 after speaking of correspondence of 1688-9 referred to in the\r\ntext he says of the answer of the authorities in Paris:\r\n\r\n\"C'etait assez pour faire echouer une enterprise, qui aurait greffe\r\nsur notre societe la grande et terrible plaie qui paralyse la force\r\nd'une portion si considerable de l'Union Americaine, l'_esclavage_,\r\ncette plaie inconnue sous notre ciel du Nord\"--\"That was effective to\r\nstrand a scheme which would have engrafted upon our society that great\r\nand terrible plague which paralyses the energies of so considerable a\r\npart of the American Union, Slavery, that plague unknown under our\r\nnorthern sky.\"\r\n\r\n[2] He was sold by David Kertk or Kirke the first English Conqueror of\r\nQuebec. England held her conquest only from 1629 to 1632, if it be\r\npermissible to call Kirke's possession that of England when he was\r\nrepudiated by his country.\r\n\r\n_Relations des Jesuites_, 1632, p. 12: do. do. 1633, p. 25. Much of\r\nthe information which follows concerning slavery in Quebec is taken\r\nfrom a paper in the _Memoirs of the Historical Society of Montreal_,\r\n1859, _De L'esclavage en Canada_, written by M. Jacques Viger and Sir\r\nL.H. Lafontaine. I have made an independent investigation and am\r\nsatisfied that the facts are truly stated. This general acknowledgment\r\nwill prevent the necessity of particular reference.\r\n\r\nIn a local history of Montreal _Memoirs de la Societe Historique de\r\nMontreal_ 1869, p. 200, there is a reference to Panis slaves in\r\nMontreal in 1670.\r\n\r\n[3] \"Mais il est bon de leur faire remarquer qu'il est a craindre que\r\nces negres, venant d'un climat si different, no perissent en Canada et\r\nle projet serait alors inutile.\" \"Il est a craindre\" that the prospect\r\nof \"le projet\" being \"inutile\" was more alarming than that of \"ces\r\nnegres\" perishing in frozen Canada.\r\n\r\n[4] The name Pani or Panis, Anglicized into Pawnee, was used generally\r\nin Canada as synonymous with \"Indian Slave\" because these slaves were\r\nusually taken from the Pawnee tribe. It is held by some that the Panis\r\nwere a tribe wholly distinct from the tribe known among the English as\r\nPawnees--_e.g._, Drake's _History of the Indians of North America_.\r\nThose who would further pursue this matter will find material in the\r\n_Wisconsin Historical Collections_, Vol. XVIII, p. 103 (note); Vigor\r\nand Lafontaine, _L'Esclavage en Canada_ cited above n. 2; _Michigan\r\nPioneer and Historical Collections_, Vol. XXVII, p. 613 (n); Vol. XXX,\r\npp. 402, 596; Vol. XXXV, p. 548; Vol. XXXVII, p. 541. From Vol XXX, p.\r\n546, we learn that Dr. Anthon, father of Prof. Anthon of Classical\r\nText-book fame, had a \"Panie Wench\" who, when the family had the\r\nsmallpox \"had them very severe\" along with Dr. Anthon's little girl\r\nand his \"aeltest boy\"--\"however they got all safe over it and are not\r\ndisfigured.\" Thwaites, an exceedingly careful writer, in his edition\r\nof _Long's Travels_, Cleveland, 1904, says in a note on page 117;\r\n\"Indian Slavery among the French was first practised in the Illinois\r\nCountry.\" He gives no authority and I know of none.\r\n\r\n[5] Referred to in Chalmers' _Collection of Treaties between Great\r\nBritain and Other Powers_, London, 1790, p. 328: Pap. Off. B. 25.\r\n\r\n[6] We shall see later in this work that by the English law, the\r\n\"villein\" was real property and in the same case as land: also that\r\nwhen Parliament came to legislate so as to make lands in the American\r\nColonies liable for debts, \"Negroes\" were included in \"hereditaments\"\r\nand therefore \"real estate.\"\r\n\r\n[7] Thus early do we find the Abolitionist getting in his fiendish\r\nwork--the enemy of society, of God and man!\r\n\r\n[8] This ordinance is quoted (_Mich. Hist. Coll._, XII, p. 511, 517)\r\nand its language ascribed to a (non-existent) \"wise and humane statute\r\nof Upper Canada of May 31, 1798\"--a curious mistake, perhaps in\r\ncopying or printing.\r\n\r\nIn Kingsford's _History of Canada_, Vol. 2, p. 507, we are told: \"In\r\n1718, several young men were prosecuted on account of their relations\r\nwith Albany carried on through Lake Champlain. One of them, M. de la\r\nDecouverte, had made himself remarkable by bringing back a Negro slave\r\nand some silver ware. One of the New York Livingstones resided in\r\nMontreal and was generally the intermediary in these transactions. The\r\nauthor adds in a note: \"This negro must have been among the first\r\nbrought to Canada.\"\r\n\r\n[9] \"A peine d'amende arbitraire et de plus grande peine si le cas y\r\nescheoit.\"\r\n\r\n[10] Canada was at this time divided into three Jurisdictions or\r\nDistricts--those of Quebec, Trois Rivieres and Montreal.\r\n\r\n[11] There are trifling variations in the English text in the several\r\nversions in the _Capitulations and Extracts of Treaties relating to\r\nCanada_, 1797; _Knox's Journal_, Vol. 2, p. 423: _Documents relative\r\nto the Colonial History of the State of New York_, Vol. 10, p. 1107.\r\nThat in the text is from Shortt & Doughty's _Constitutional Documents\r\n1759-1791, Canadian Archives Publication_, Ottawa, 1907. There is no\r\nsubstantial difference in terminology and none at all in meaning. I\r\ngive the French version, as to which there is no dispute: \"Les Negres\r\net panis des deux Sexes resteront En leur qualite d'Esclaves, en la\r\npossession des francois et Canadiens a qui Ils apartiement; Il leur\r\nSera libre de les garder a leur Service dans la Colonie od de les\r\nvendre, Et Ils pourront aussi Continuer a les faire Elever dans la\r\nReligion Romaine.\"\r\n\r\n[12] The Province of Ontario is the proud possessor of many of Paul\r\nKane's sketches.\r\n\r\n[13] Now the Royal Canadian Institute. The paper appears in Series II\r\nof the _Transactions_, Vol. 2, p. 20 (1857).\r\n\r\nThe use by the Indians of Slaves is noted very early: for example in\r\nGalinee's _Narrative_ of the extraordinary voyage of LaSalle and\r\nothers in 1669-70 the travellers are shown to have obtained from the\r\nIndians, slaves as guides. See pp. 21, 27, 43 of Coyne's edition, 4\r\n_Ont. Hist. Soc. Papers_ (1903). These Indians were accustomed to take\r\ntheir slaves to the Dutch. _Ibid._, p. 27.\r\n\r\nStill there is not very much in the old authors about slavery among\r\nthe Indians: the references are incidental and fragmentary and the\r\ninstitution is taken for granted. Thus in Lescarbot's _History of New\r\nFrance_, published in 1609, the only reference which I recall is on\r\npp. 270, 449 of The Champlain Society's edition, Toronto, 1914;\r\nspeaking of the Micmacs the author says: \" ... the conquerors keep the\r\nwomen and children prisoners ... herein they retain more humanity than\r\nis sometimes shown by Christians. For in any case, one should be\r\nsatisfied to make them slaves as do our savages or to make them\r\npurchase their liberty.\"\r\n\r\n[14] It will be remembered that the ancient law of Rome, the Twelve\r\nTables, authorized creditors to take an insolvent debtor, kill him and\r\ndivide his body amongst them, a real execution against the person more\r\ntrenchant if not more effective than the _capias ad satisfaciendum_\r\ndear to the English lawyer.\r\n\r\n[15] Everyone has shuddered at the awful picture drawn by Juvenal in\r\nhis Sixth Satire of the fashionable Roman dame who had eight husbands\r\nin five years and who ordered her slave to immediate crucifixion. When\r\nher husband mildly ventured to suggest that there should at least be\r\nsome evidence of guilt and that no time should be considered long\r\nwhere the life of a man is in question he was snubbed, just as the\r\nRoman lady who was expostulated with for taking her bath in the\r\npresence of man slaves asked \"_An servus homo?_\" The horrible but\r\npithy dialogue reads:\r\n\r\n    \"Pone crucem servo.\" \"Meruit quo crimine servus\r\n    Supplicium? Quis testis adest? Quis detulit? Audi\r\n    Nulla umquam de morte hominis cunctatio longa est\"\r\n    \"O demens, ita servus homo est? Nil fecerit, esto\r\n    Hoc volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas.\"\r\n                         --_Juvenal, Sat._, VI, ll. 219-223.\r\n\r\n\"The cross for the slave!\" \"What is the charge? What is the evidence?\r\nWho laid the information? Hear what he has to say--No delay is ever\r\ngreat where the death of a man is in question.\" \"You driveller! So a\r\nslave is a man! Have it your own way--he did nothing. I wish it, that\r\nis my order, my wish is a good enough reason.\"\r\n\r\nThe natural death for a Roman slave was on the cross or under the\r\nscourge.\r\n\r\n[16] Constantine also by his Constitution No. 319 provided for slaves\r\nbecoming free: the Constitution referred to in the text is No. 326.\r\nThe best short account of slave legislation in Rome which I have seen\r\nis in a paper read by the late Vice Chancellor Proudfoot of the\r\nOntario Court of Chancery, February 7, 1891, before the Canadian\r\nInstitute. _Trans. Can. Ins._, Series IV, Vol. 2, p. 173. Many of the\r\njudgments of Vice Chancellor Proudfoot (venerabile nomen) show a\r\nprofound knowledge and appreciation of the Civil Law.\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from Prof. Sherman's great work _Roman Law in\r\nthe Modern World_, Boston, 1917. The learned author has laid\r\nphilosophical lawyers of all countries under heavy obligations by this\r\nsplendid book, as noted for its lucidity as for its learning.\r\n\r\nVol. I, 69. \"To inflict unnatural cruelty upon--and finally to kill--a\r\nslave was prohibited by Augustus Claudius and Antoninus Pius.\r\nMoreover, because by natural law all men were born free and equal (see\r\nDigest, 50, 17, 32) the Emperor often restored to slaves the status of\r\na freeborn person.\"\r\n\r\nI, 146. \"Constantine ... abolished crucifixion as a punishment;\r\nencouraged the emancipation of slaves....\"\r\n\r\nI, 150. \" ... It is regrettable that Christianity did not change other\r\nparts of the Roman law of persons which ought to have been reformed.\r\nThe chief example of this failure is slavery, which the law of\r\nJustinian fully recognized. The inertia of past centuries as to\r\nslavery was too great to be overcome. St. Paul's attitude towards\r\nslavery was to recognize the _status quo_, and he did not counsel\r\nwholesale emancipation. But Christianity continued the progress of the\r\npagan law along the lines of mercy and kindness, _e.g._, to poison a\r\nslave or brand him was treated in later Imperial Roman law as\r\nhomicide, and manumission was made easier; but the Church did not\r\nrecognize the marriage of slaves until over 300 years after\r\nJustinian's death.\"\r\n\r\nII, 434, \"In Roman law ... the slave was a thing or chattel--nothing\r\nmore legally. Slaves could no hold property--slaves could not marry,\r\ntheir actual unions were never legally recognized.\"\r\n\r\nII, 436, \"With the advent of Greek culture and Christianity the harsh\r\nmanners of ancient Rome became greatly altered.\"\r\n\r\nII, 828, \"One feature of the Lex Aquilia is ... that it granted an\r\naction in damages for the unlawful killing of ... the slave of another\r\nman.\" _Inst._, 413, pr; Gaius 3, 210.\r\n\r\nII. 829, \" ... the owner had his option either of suing the culprit\r\nfor damages under the lex Aquilia or of causing him to be criminally\r\nprosecuted.\" _Inst._, 4, 3, 11 Gaius 3, 213.\r\n\r\nII, 935, \"A free person called as a witness could not be subjected to\r\ntorture, but a slave could be tortured.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY BRITISH PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Canada passed under the British flag by conquest there was for a\r\ntime confusion as to the law in force. During the military regime from\r\n1760 to 1764 the authorities did the best they could and applied such\r\nlaw as they thought the best for the particular case. There was no\r\ndislocation in the common affairs of the country. When Canada was\r\nformally ceded to Britain by the Treaty of Paris, 1763,[1] it was not\r\nlong before there was issued a royal proclamation creating among other\r\nthings a \"Government of Quebec\" with its western boundary a line drawn\r\nfrom the \"South end of Lake Nipissim\"[2] to the point at which the\r\nparallel of 45 deg. north latitude crosses the River St. Lawrence. In all\r\nthat vast territory the English law, civil and criminal, was\r\nintroduced.[3] It is important now to see what was the law of England\r\nat the time respecting slavery.\r\n\r\nThe dictum of Lord Chief Justice Holt: \"As soon as a slave enters\r\nEngland he becomes free,\"[4] was succeeded by the decision of the\r\nCourt of King's Bench to the same effect in the celebrated case of\r\nSomerset _v._ Stewart,[5] when Lord Mansfield is reported to have\r\nsaid: \"The air of England has long been too pure for a slave and every\r\nman is free who breathes it.\"[6]\r\n\r\nJames Somerset,[7] a Negro slave of Charles Stewart in Jamaica,\r\n\"purchased from the African coast in the course of the slave trade as\r\ntolerated in the plantations,\" had been brought by his master to\r\nEngland \"to attend and abide with him and to carry him back as soon as\r\nhis business should be transacted.\" The Negro refused to go back,\r\nwhereupon he was put in irons and taken on board the ship _Ann and\r\nMary_ lying in the Thames and bound for Jamaica. Lord Mansfield\r\ngranted a writ of habeas corpus requiring Captain Knowles to produce\r\nSomerset before him with the cause of the detainer. On the motion, the\r\ncause being stated as above indicated, Lord Mansfield referred the\r\nmatter to the full court of King's Bench; whereupon, on June 22, 1772,\r\njudgment was given for the Negro.[8] The basis of the decision and the\r\ntheme of the argument were that the only kind of slavery known to\r\nEnglish law was villeinage, that the Statute of Tenures enacted in\r\n1660, expressly abolished villeins regardant to a manor and by\r\nimplication villeins in gross. The reasons for the decision would\r\nhardly stand fire at the present day. The investigation of Paul\r\nVinogradoff and others have conclusively established that there was\r\nnot a real difference in status between the so-called villein\r\nregardant and villein in gross, and that in any case the villein was\r\nnot properly a slave but rather a serf.[9] Moreover, the Statute of\r\nTenures deals solely with tenure and not with status.\r\n\r\nBut what seems to have been taken for granted, namely that slavery,\r\npersonal slavery, had never existed in England and that the only\r\nunfree person was the villein, who, by the way, was real property, is\r\ncertainly not correct. Slaves were known in England as mere personal\r\ngoods and chattels, bought and sold, at least as late as the middle of\r\nthe twelfth century.[10] However weak the reasons given for the\r\ndecision, its authority has never been questioned and it is good law.\r\nBut it is good law for England, for even in the Somerset case it was\r\nadmitted that a concurrence of unhappy circumstances had rendered\r\nslavery necessary[11] in the American colonies; and Parliament had\r\nrecognized the right of property in slaves there.[12] Consequently so\r\nlong as the slaves, Panis or Negro, remained in the colony they were\r\nnot enfranchised by the law of the conqueror but retained their\r\nservile status.\r\n\r\nThe early records show the use of slaves. General James Murray, who\r\nbecame Governor of the Quebec Fortifications and adjoining territory\r\nimmediately after the fall of Quebec and in 1763 the first Captain\r\nGeneral and Governor in Chief of the new Province of Quebec,[13]\r\nwriting from Quebec, November 2, 1763, to John Watts in New York\r\nspeaks thus of the promoting of agriculture in the Province:\r\n\r\n\"I must most earnestly entreat your assistance, without servants\r\nnothing can be done, had I the inclination to employ soldiers which is\r\nnot the case, they would disappoint me, and Canadians will work for\r\nnobody but themselves. Black Slaves are certainly the only people to\r\nbe depended upon, but it is necessary, I imagine they should be born\r\nin one or other of our Northern Colonies, the Winters here will not\r\nagree with a Native of the torrid zone, pray therefore if possible\r\nprocure for me two Stout Young Fellows, who have been accustomed to\r\nCountry Business, and as I shall wish to see them happy, I am of\r\nopinion there is little felicity without a Communication with the\r\nLadys, you may buy for each a clean young wife, who can wash and do\r\nthe female offices about a farm. I shall begrudge no price, so hope we\r\nmay, by your goodness succeed.\"[14]\r\n\r\nFrom time to time slavery makes its appearance in official\r\ncorrespondence. Moreover, there are still subsisting records which\r\nshow the prevalence of slavery in the province.[15] In January, 1763,\r\nthere took place at Longueuil the marriage of Marie, slave of baroness\r\nde Longueuil, with Jacques Cesar, slave of M. Ignace Gamelin. From\r\n1763 to 1769 there are found records of the baptism of the children\r\nof slaves in the registers of the Parish of Lachine. In the first\r\nissue of the _Gazette_ of Montreal, June 3, 1778, there is an\r\nadvertisement by the widow Dufy Desaulniers, offering a reward of six\r\ndollars for the return to her of a female slave who had run away on\r\nthe 14th. She was thirty-five years old and she was dressed in striped\r\ncalico of the ordinary cut and was of \"tolerable stoutness.\"\r\n\r\nAlexander Henry writing from Montreal, October 5, 1778, to the\r\nGovernor Sir Frederick Haldimand, says that he had obtained a Judgment\r\nin the Court of Common Pleas against one Gillelande in the colonies\r\nwho owed him a considerable sum of money. \"Hearing that a Negro of his\r\nhad deserted from him,\" said Henry, \"and was lurking in this Province\r\nI obtained an execution upon that judgment and got the negro\r\napprehended--who is still in gaol.\" General Powell who was the\r\nCommander there sent to Mr. Gray the Sheriff desiring him to postpone\r\nthe sale until such time as the Governor should be made acquainted\r\nwith the matter. Mr. Gray thereafter informed Mr. Henry that he\r\nmentioned the affair to Sir Frederic Haldimand, who likewise ordered\r\nthe sheriff to postpone the sale until the Governor could confer with\r\nthe Attorney-General. The Attorney-General thereafter informed Mr.\r\nHenry that he had spoken to the Governor, who was of the opinion that\r\nthe civil law should take its course.... Mr. Gray thought he should\r\nhave some definite authority to sell.... He said: \"There are some\r\ngentlemen from the Upper Countries[16] whom I presume will give more\r\nfor him than any person resident here and ... they are now on their\r\nreturn.\" He asked that an order for sale should be sent before the\r\ndeparture of these gentlemen.[16] The higher price which the\r\ngentlemen from the \"Upper Countries\" would pay indicates the objection\r\nof those in the old settled parts of the province to Slavery.\r\n\r\nAn official report made in 1778 by James Monk, Attorney General at\r\nQuebec, to the Governor, Sir Guy Carleton, (afterwards Lord\r\nDorchester) gives a sufficiently full account of an occurrence the\r\nsubject of much controversy and correspondence showing the\r\nsignificance of slavery at that time. The Attorney General examined\r\nthe several papers, making a case of complaint, by Joseph Despin of\r\nSt. Francois Merchant a trader against Major de Barner Commanding a\r\nRegiment of Light Infantry Chasseurs of Brunswick Troops. Despin\r\ncomplained to Brigadier General Ehrenkrook, Commander of the Brunswick\r\nTroops at Trois Rivieres, that Major de Barner by his orders or\r\notherwise at Midnight of the first of the previous June, occasioned\r\nforcibly to be taken from said Despin a Negro-woman slave, Despin's\r\nproperty and suffered her to be carried out of the province. He\r\ntherefore prayed Brigadier General Ehrenkrook, that Major de Barner\r\nmight either return to him the said slave with damages or pay to\r\nDespin the value thereof.\r\n\r\nUpon this complaint an inquiry was made. In the course of this inquiry\r\nJoseph Despin did not support his complaint and charge with those\r\nlegal proofs which could entitle him to recover from Major de Earner\r\nthereupon; \"or induce a Court of Justice to consider Major de Barner\r\nas having either given any others for the taking of, or even had any\r\nknowledge touching the intended escape of the Slave.\" The complaint of\r\nDespin was then deemed very justly dismissed.\r\n\r\nUpon the dismission of this complaint Major de Barner requested of the\r\nGovernor satisfaction and punishment upon the accuser, and a notary,\r\none Robin, who prepared notarial acts, in an unbecoming affrontive\r\nmanner. This request was made under three heads: first, that Despin\r\nmight be exemplarily punished, not merely for a false dishonoring\r\naccusation of Major de Barner, a commanding officer and injurious to\r\nhis whole battalion, but punishment for the personal insults to Major\r\nde Barner and his character; second, that Despin might pay the\r\nexpenses of preparing and making out writings; and third, that the\r\nsaid Robin, the notary, may be equally punished for using expressions\r\nin his acts hurtful and indecent to persons of honor and character.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General asserted that there is reason to conclude from\r\nthe several testimonies appearing in the case, that Despin had lost\r\nhis slave by means of some soldiers belonging to the Battalion of\r\nChasseurs which Major de Barner Commanded, _though not in the least by\r\nthe orders or with the knowledge or consent of Major de Barner as\r\ncharged_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary stories of the time is told by William\r\nDummer Powell afterwards Chief Justice of Upper Canada, but in\r\n1780[17] and later practising as a barrister in Montreal. \"Meeting in\r\nthe Street of Montreal an armed Party escorting to the Provost Guard\r\nseveral female prisoners and Children,\" says Mr. Powell, \"curiosity\r\nwas excited and upon engaging the Non-Commissioned Officer commanding\r\nthe Escort, Mr. Powell was informed that they were Prisoners of war,\r\ntaken in the Kentucky Country and brought into Detroit by a Detachment\r\nof the Garrison and now arrived from thence. Further Enquiry after\r\nprocuring necessary relief to the first wants of the party, drew from\r\nMrs. Agnes La Force the following Narrative:\r\n\r\n\"That her husband was a loyal Subject in the Province of North\r\nCarolina,[18] having a good Plantation well stocked and a numerous\r\nfamily. That his political Sentiments exposed him to so much\r\nAnnoyance from the governing Party, that he determined to retire into\r\nthe wilderness, that he accordingly mustered his whole family,\r\nconsisting of several Sons and their Wives and Children, and\r\nSons-in-law with their Wives and Children, a numerous band of select\r\nand valuable Slaves Male and female, and a large Stock of Cattle, with\r\nwhich they proceeded westward, intending to retire into Kentucky.\r\n\r\n\"That after\" the accidental death of the father they pursued their\r\nroute to the westward and settled with their Slaves in the wilderness\r\nabout five hundred miles from any civil establishment. After a\r\nresidence of three years, a party of regular Troops and Indians from\r\nthe British Garrison at Detroit appeared in the plain and summoned\r\nthem to surrender.[18] \"Relying upon British faith,\" says Mr. Powell,\r\n\"they open'd their Gate on condition of Protection to their Persons\r\nand property from the Indians; but they had no sooner surrendered and\r\nreceived that promise than her sons and sons-in-law had to resort to\r\narms to resist the Insults of the Indians to their wives and\r\nSlaves.[19] Several lives were lost and the whole surviving Party was\r\nmarched into Detroit, about six hundred Miles, where the Slaves were\r\ndistributed among the Captors and the rest marched or boated eight\r\nhundred miles further to Montreal and driven into the Provot Prison as\r\nCattle into a Pound.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThis story will be credited with difficulty but accident some time\r\nafter put into the hands of Mr. Powell a document of undeniable\r\ncredit, which, however, was unnecessary: for on Mr. Powell's\r\nrepresentation of the case to Sir F. Haldimand the most peremptory\r\norders to the Commandant at Detroit to find out the slaves of Mrs. La\r\nForce in whose ever possession they might be and transmit them to\r\ntheir mistress at Montreal. But Detroit was too far distant from\r\nheadquarters and interests prompting to disobedience of such an order\r\ntoo prevalent for it to produce any effect; and the commandant\r\nacknowledged in answer to a reiterated order that the slaves could not\r\nbe produced, although their names and those of their new masters were\r\ncorrectly ascertained and the following list transmitted with the\r\norder.\r\n\r\nList of slaves formerly the property of Mrs. Agnes La Force and in\r\npossession of others:\r\n\r\n  Negro   Scipio     in possession of   Simon Girty[20]\r\n   do     Tim         \"       \"     \"   Mr. Le Duc.\r\n   do     Ishener     \"       \"     \"    do   do\r\n   do     Stephen     \"       \"     \"   Captn.

McKee.\r\n   do     Bess       --Grace Rachel--and Patrick-Indians\"\r\n  ----\r\n   13\r\n\r\nThe case of Mrs. La Force and some similar cases led Haldimand to\r\nrequire Sir John Johnson, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, to\r\nreport. He wrote from Quebec, July 16, 1781, \"Several complaints\r\nhaving been made upon the subject of selling negroes brought into this\r\nProvince (Quebec) by scouting parties--who allege a Right to Freedom\r\nand others belonging to Loyalists who are obliged to relinquish their\r\nproperties or reclaim them by paying the money for which they were\r\nsold, I must desire that you upon the most minute enquiry give in to\r\nBrigadier General Maclean a Return of all Negroes who have been\r\nbrought into the Province by Parties in any Respect under your\r\nDirections whether Troops or Indians, specifying their names, their\r\nformer masters, whether Loyalists or Rebels, by whom brought in and to\r\nwhom sold, at what price and where they are at present. I shall direct\r\nCols. Campbell and Clans to do the same by which it will be in my\r\nPower to reduce the Grievances now complained of and to make such\r\narrangements as will prevent them in future.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson sent a return of Negroes to Maclean and Maclean July 26, 1781,\r\nand they sent it on to Haldimand: Clans and Campbell made returns\r\ndirect to Haldimand in August of the same year. Fortunately the\r\ncovering letters are extant as are the reports. There is also one\r\nNegro, Abraham, reported in a Return of Rebel Prisoners in and about\r\nMontreal as having been taken June 18, 1781; and, therefore, about a\r\nyear after Mrs. La Force's capture.[21]\r\n\r\n\"Of the fifty or more slaves named in this list,\" says Dr. T. W.\r\nSmith, \"nearly half were sold at Montreal, a few being carried by the\r\nIndians and Whites to Niagara. The others were handed to their former\r\nowners. 'Charles' 'taken at Balls Town making his escape out of a\r\nwindow in Col. Gordon's house' was sold to the Rev. David C. DeLisle,\r\nthe Episcopal rector at Montreal, for L20 Halifax currency; Samuel\r\nJudah, Montreal, paid L24 for 'Jacob' also a slave of Col. Gordon, a\r\nrebel master, but for a Negro girl of the same owner he gave L60;\r\nNero, another of Col. Gordon's slaves, captured by a Mohawk Indian,\r\nPatrick Langan sold to John Mittleberger of Montreal for L60; 'Tom'\r\nwas sold by Captain Thompson of Col. Butler's Rangers for L25 to Sir\r\nJohn Johnson who gave him to Mr. Langan; and William Bowen, a Loyalist\r\nowner, sold his recovered slave 'Jack' for L70 to Captain John\r\nMcDonell of the Rangers. 'William,' who was also sold for L30 to Mr.\r\nMcDonell and afterwards carried to Quebec, had been taken from his\r\nmaster's house by Mohawk Indians under Captain John the Mohawk with a\r\nwagon and horses which he had got ready to convey his mistress Mrs.\r\nFonda wife of Major Fonda to Schenectady ... another Negro man, name\r\nunknown, was sold 'by a soldier of the 8th Regiment to Lieutenant\r\nHerkimer of the Corps of Rangers, who disposed of him to Ensign\r\nSutherland of the Royal Regiment of New York.'\"\r\n\r\nNegroes were not the only victims of Indian raids. In 1782 Powell had\r\nanother experience, which is indicative of the practices of the\r\nIndians during the Revolutionary War.[22] In his letter to the\r\nCommissary of Prisoners at Quebec he wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Montreal, 22 August, 1782.,\r\n\r\n     \"Sir\r\n\r\n     I should make an Apology for the Liberty I take but that I\r\n     consider it a public Duty.\r\n\r\n     When you were here some time since, I am informed that mention\r\n     was made to you of a young female slave bought of the Indians by\r\n     a Mr. Campbell, a Publican of this Town, and that when you\r\n     learned that she was the Daughter of decent family in\r\n     Pensilvania[23] captured by the Indians at 10 years of age, your\r\n     Humanity opposed itself to the barbarous Claim of her Master and\r\n     you Promised that she should be returned to her Parents by the\r\n     first Flag with Prisoners.\r\n\r\n     \"In consequence of such a Promise,\" continued he, \"the Child had\r\n     been taught to expect a speedy release from her Bondage, and,\r\n     finding that her Name was in the List permitted by his Excellency\r\n     to cross the Lines with a flag from St. Johns,[24] she imagined\r\n     that there could be no Obstacle to her Return; but, being\r\n     informed that Mr. Campbell had threatened to give her back to the\r\n     Indians, she eloped last Evening, and took refuge in my House\r\n     from whence a female Prisoner, (sometime a nurse to my children)\r\n     was to sett off this Morning for the Neighborhood of the Child's\r\n     Parents. Upon Application from Mr. Campbell to Brigadr. Genl. De\r\n     Speht setting forth that He had furnished her with money, an\r\n     order was obtained for the delivery of the Child to her Master\r\n     and there was no time for any other Accommodation than an\r\n     undertaking on my part to reimburse Mr. Campbell the Price he\r\n     paid for her to the Indians. This I am to do on his producing a\r\n     Certificate from some Military Gentleman, whom he says was\r\n     present at the Sale. I have no objection to an Act of Charity of\r\n     this Nature, but _all Political Considerations aside_, I am of\r\n     opinion that the national Honor is interested, that this\r\n     Redemption should not be the Act of an Individual. As Commissary\r\n     of Prisoners I have stated the Case to you, Sir, that you may\r\n     determine upon the propriety of reimbursing me, or not, the sum I\r\n     may be obliged to pay on this occasion.\r\n\r\n     \"That all may be fairly stated I should observe that the Child\r\n     was never returned a Prisoner,[25] nor has drawn Provisions as\r\n     such--although there can be no doubt of her political character,\r\n     having been captured by our Savages.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply to this communication was:\r\n\r\n     \"I am favored with your's by Saturday's post and have since layed\r\n     it before His Excellency the Commander in Chief, and I have the\r\n     Pleasure to inform you that he approves much of your Conduct and\r\n     feels himself obliged for your very humane Interposition to\r\n     rescue the poor unfortunate Sarah Cole from the Clutches of the\r\n     miscreant Campbell; and I am further to inform you that your\r\n     letter has been transmitted by his Secretary to the Judges at\r\n     Montreal, not only to make Campbell forfeit the money he says he\r\n     paid for the Girl, but if possible to punish and make him an\r\n     example to prevent such inhuman conduct for the Future; but in\r\n     any Event you shall be indemnified for the very generous\r\n     Engagement you entered into.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been established that Mr. Powell had redeemed his word the day\r\nit was given and paid Mr. Campbell Twelve Guineas[26] on production of\r\na string of Wampum delivered by the Indians with the girl and the\r\nmoney paid by Campbell. A cartel went forward August 22, 1782, and in\r\nthe list of prisoners sent south appears the name \"Sarah Coal.\"[27]\r\nHaldimand gave Mr. Justice Mabane, the man of all work of his\r\nadministration, instructions to see to it that Campbell did not profit\r\nby his inhumanity and also to take such steps that the practice should\r\nnot prevail for the future.[27]\r\n\r\nA petition presented to Haldimand in 1783, however, discloses another\r\ntransaction with the Indians.[28] Jacob Adams presented the petition\r\nDecember 13 of that year from Carleton Island. He said:\r\n\r\n     \"I have taken a Yankee Boy (by name Francis Cole)[29] with a\r\n     party of Messesagee Indians--afterwards when I arrived at\r\n     Carleton Island with the said party of Indians and said Yankee\r\n     Boy, the Commanding Officer (Captain Aubrey) demanded the\r\n     Prisoners Vizt. this Boy and an old man[30] the Indians refus'd\r\n     giving them up on which Capt. Aubrey gave me Liberty to purchase\r\n     them and so I did by paying sixteen Gallons Rum for the Boy which\r\n     cost me at this place twenty shillings, York Currency, pr.\r\n     Gallon,[31] and he the said Yankee Boy was to serve me the term\r\n     of four years (with his own lawfull consent) for my redeeming\r\n     him. As for the old man I likewise bought him for two Gallons Rum\r\n     but Capt. Aubrey requested I should send him Prisoner to Your\r\n     Excellency. I acted accordingly. I likewise gave a shirt apiece\r\n     to each of the two Chiefs who belonged to said party in like\r\n     manner I lost twenty-four shillings York Currency by four Keggs\r\n     which the above Rum was put into.[32]\r\n\r\n     \"Now, may it please Yr Excellency this said Yankee Boy remained\r\n     very peaceably and quietly with me for the space of two months\r\n     during which Time I took him several Journeys to Fort Stanwix and\r\n     Oswego and whilst I was absent he got acquainted with some of the\r\n     soldiers on this Island who persuaded him to get off from me and\r\n     accordingly he got off in the manner following: when Lieut.\r\n     Peppin of the 5th Regiment and his Party were embarking on board\r\n     the Haldimand to go to Niagara, he privately got on board and\r\n     remained there Incog. for one Day and a Night on which I made an\r\n     application to Mr. Peppin to make a search for him and\r\n     accordingly he did and found him and likewise brought him before\r\n     the Commanding Officer who asked the Boy his Reasons for Running\r\n     away from me: he replied He did not chuse to live with me on\r\n     which Capt. Aubreay has sent him down as Prisoner to Yr.\r\n     Excellency.\r\n\r\n     \"May it please Your Excellency I expect your Excellency will\r\n     please to take my Case into consideration by granting me the\r\n     Request of being paid for what I have lost by said Prisoner or\r\n     the Yankee Boy, to be returned to me....\"[33]\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting at this time or later instances of those\r\nconvicted of crime buying their lives by enlistment for life. One case\r\nof a mulatto, a slave, may be here mentioned. A mulatto called\r\nMiddleton was convicted at Montreal in 1781 of a felony (probably\r\nlarceny) which carried the sentence of death. He was an expert\r\nmechanic of a class of men much in demand in the army and he was given\r\na pardon conditioned upon his enlisting for life. He chose the Second\r\nBatallion of Sir John Johnson's Royal American Regiment then in Quebec\r\nand was handed over by Sheriff Gray to the officers of that corps\r\nafter having taken the oath of allegiance administered to all\r\nrecruits.[34]\r\n\r\nMany slaves were employed as boatmen, laborers, and the like, in the\r\narmy. We find a letter from headquarters at Quebec to Captain Maurer\r\nwho was at Montreal, dated October 6, 1783, which reads:\r\n\r\n     \"Having had the Honor to communicate to His Excellency, the\r\n     Commander-in-Chief, your intimation that applications have been\r\n     made by the Proprietors of some Negro's Serving Capt. Harkimer's\r\n     (Herkimer) Company of Batteau Men to have them restored to them\r\n     and desiring to receive His Excellency's Pleasure therein, I am\r\n     directed to signify to you His Excellency's Commands that all\r\n     such Negro's to be given up on the Requisition of their owners,\r\n     provided they produce sufficient Proofs of their Property and\r\n     give full acknowledgments or Receipts for them which must be\r\n     taken in the most ample manner to prevent future claims and to\r\n     have the necessary recourse to those Persons who receive them\r\n     should different applications be made for the above Negro's.\"[35]\r\n\r\nPeace had come[36] and there was no more need for a large army. But it\r\nwas some years before the Indians of the western country ceased from\r\ntheir practice of making prisoners.[37]\r\n\r\n     [Transcriber's Note: The following two tables were published as\r\n     one large, wide table.

Verg. E. 2, 19.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cowper in _The Task_, written 1783-1785, imitated this in his\r\nwell-known lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Slaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs\r\n    Receive our air, that moment they are free.\r\n    They touch our country and their shackles fall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[7] I use the spelling in Lofft. The State Trials and Lord Campbell\r\nhave \"Somersett\" and \"Steuart.\"\r\n\r\n[8] This was in direct opposition to the opinion of Sir Philip Yorke,\r\nAttorney General (afterwards Lord Chancellor Lord Hardwicke) and Sir\r\nCharles Talbot, Solicitor General (afterwards Lord Chancellor Lord\r\nTalbot) who had pledged themselves to the British planters for all the\r\nlegal consequences of Slaves coming over to England. The law of\r\nScotland agreed with that of England.\r\n\r\n[9] See _e.g._, Vinogradoff, _Villeinage in England_, passim. Hallam's\r\n_Middle Ages_ (ed. 1827), Vol. 3, p. 256; Pollock and Maitland,\r\n_History of English Law_, Vol. 1, pp. 395, sqq.

Necessity is generally but another name\r\nfor greed or worse.\r\n\r\n[12] For example, the Statute of (1732) 5 Geo. II, c. 7, enacted, sec.\r\n4, \"that from and after the said 29th September, 1732, the Houses,\r\nLands, Negroes and other Hereditaments and real Estates situate or\r\nbeing within any of the said (British) Plantations (in America) shall\r\nbe liable\" to be sold under execution. Note that the Negroes are\r\n\"Hereditaments and Real estate,\" as were the villeins--a rule wholly\r\ndifferent from that of the French law.\r\n\r\n[13] His Commission is dated November 28, 1763, Shortt & Doughty,\r\n_Constitutional Documents_, 1759-1761, pp. 126, sqq.\r\n\r\n[14] _Canadian Archives, Murray Papers_, Vol. II, p. 15: the Quebec\r\nAct mentioned immediately below is (1774) 14 George III, c. 83.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 the well known Quebec Act reintroduced the former French\r\nCanadian law in civil matters while it retained the English law in\r\ncriminal matters; but the change made no difference in the condition\r\nof the slave.\r\n\r\n[15] The three which follow I owe to the interesting paper of Mr. E.\r\nZ. Massicotte, Archivist of Montreal published in _Le Bulletin des\r\nRecherches Historiques_ for November, 1918, pp. 348 sqq.--the\r\nadvertisement in the Gazette is to be found in Terrill's _Chronicles\r\nof Montreal_. The paper was 2-1/2 Spanish dollars per annum, 10 sous\r\nper copy, published every Wednesday.\r\n\r\n[16] The \"Upper Countries\" were Detroit and Michilimackinae, sometimes\r\nincluding the Niagara region--at this time there were practically no\r\nresidents in what became the Province of Upper Canada and is now the\r\nProvince of Ontario. The letter is to be found in the _Canadian\r\nArchives_, B. 217, p. 21: as no further record appears, it is to be\r\npresumed that an order was made for sale by the Sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe Report of James Monk Attorney-General at Quebec about to be\r\nmentioned is to be found in the _Canadian Archives_, B. 207, p. 105.\r\n\r\n\r\n[17] In the same year a much wronged Negro petitioned Haldimand. His\r\npetition dated at Quebec, October 17, 1778, reads: \"To His Excellency\r\nFrederick\r\n\r\nHaldimand, Governor & Commander in Chief of all Kanady and the\r\nterritories thereunto belonging,\r\n\r\nThe Petition of Joseph King humbly sheweth that Your Petitioner has\r\nbeen twice taken by the Yankys and sold by them each time at Public\r\nVendue: he has made his escape and brought two white men through the\r\nwoods: he was a servant to Captain McCoy last winter in Montreal and\r\ncame here (Quebec) last spring. Your Petitioner has gone through many\r\nPerils and Dangers of his life for making his escape from the Yankeys.\r\nHe hoaps that Your Excellency through the abundance of Your\r\nBenevolence will grant him his liberty for which your poor Petitioner\r\nas in Duty bound will ever pray.\" _Canadian Archives_, B. 217, p. 324.\r\n\r\n[18] In the Petition referred to _post_, Mrs. La Force states that her\r\nhusband was \"late of Virginia.\"\r\n\r\n[19] I have followed the Powell MSS. in spelling, capitalization, etc.\r\n\r\n[20] They were taken in an expedition nominally under Captain Bird but\r\nhe had little control over the Indians and had only a few men of his\r\nown British Regulars. He had had bitter experience of the cruelty and\r\nunreliability of the Indians in 1779 but had to go with them in 1780.\r\nThis was not one of the two large Forts which Bird took in his 1780\r\nexpedition, Fort Liberty and Martin's Station, but a smaller\r\nfortification. It was taken June 26, 1780 (_Can. Arch._, B. 172, 480);\r\nthat there were several small forts is certain; that some of the\r\nprisoners brought to Detroit were from the small forts and that they\r\n(or some of them) were not rebels appears from the letter from De\r\nPeyster of August 4, 1780 (_Canadian Archives_, B. 100, p. 441): \"In a\r\nformer letter to the Commander in Chief,\" said he, \"I observed that it\r\nwould be dangerous having so many Prisoners here but I then thought\r\nthose small Forts were occupied by a different set of people.\"\r\n\r\n[21] The well-known so-called Renegade, is in reality a loyal subject\r\nwhose reputation pays the penalty of a losing cause. The others are\r\nall well-known loyalists of Detroit.\r\n\r\nMrs. La Force's Petition to Haldimand is still extant. _Canadian\r\nArchives_, B. 217, p. 116. Her name is included in the list of women\r\nand children remaining at Montreal, the list being dated Quebec,\r\nSeptember 11, 1782, and she being given as of Virginia and taken June\r\n26, 1780.\r\n\r\n[22] The correspondence, &c., is in the _Canadian Archives_, B. 129,\r\np. 221, 225; B. 159, p. 152; B. 183, p. 284. A Negro taken \"horse\r\nhunting\" by a party of Puttewatamies in the West is mentioned August\r\n16, 1782, in B. 123, p. 290. He belonged to Epharaim Hart from whom he\r\ndeserted and was taken about 20 miles up Cross Creek. I copy from a\r\nManuscript of Powell's in my possession which I have compared with a\r\nphotostate copy of a manuscript in the _Canadian Archives_.\r\n\r\n[23] The western part of Pennsylvania is meant. This region was\r\nseething with conflicts on a small scale between the Loyalists and the\r\nRepublicans. The Indians for the most part took the side of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n[24] In what is now the Province of Quebec.\r\n\r\n[25] In 1780 Germain instructed Haldimand that \"all prisoners from\r\nrevolted Provinces are committed as guilty of high treason not as\r\nprisoners of war\" (_Canadian Archives_, B. 59, p. 54) but a change\r\nsoon took place and after some intermediate stages, Shelburne, the\r\nHome Secretary, in April, 1782, instructed Haldimand that all American\r\nprisoners were to be held for exchange. _Canadian Archives_, B. 50, p.\r\n164.\r\n\r\n[26] By the Ordinance of March 29, 1777, 17 George III, c. 9, the\r\nguinea was declared equivalent to L1.3.4, Quebec Currency: this would\r\nmake the price of the girl, $42.60. See note 30 post. It is to be\r\npresumed that Powell was repaid. He nowhere complains that he was not\r\nas he certainly would have done if he had cause to do so.\r\n\r\nNegroes were frequently arriving in the colony and seeking aid and\r\nsubsistence. For example, we find Thomas Scott, J. P., reporting\r\nThursday, May 17, 1781: \"The Bearer John Jacob a Negro man just\r\narrived from Montreal has applied to me for relief in his case as set\r\nforth in the Annexed Paper. But as I apprehend that can only be given\r\nhim by His Excellency the Governor I respectfully recommend him to His\r\nExcellency's notice.\" _Canadian Archives_, B. 100, p. 72.\r\n\r\n[27] See _Canadian Archives_, B. 130, pp. 33, 34.\r\n\r\n[28] It is more than doubtful that the prohibition of the sale of\r\nwhite captives by the Indians would be productive of good. The natural\r\nresult would rather be that the Indians would kill their white\r\ncaptives at once or torture them to death. At the best the prisoners\r\nwould in most cases, if adults become slaves and if young be adopted\r\ninto the tribe. There are numerous instances of white captives being\r\nslain because unsaleable while the Negroes escaped death because they\r\nfound a ready market. See the story of Thomas Ridout, post, note 37.\r\nThe order of Haldimand will be found in the Canadian Archives.\r\n\r\n[29] Remembering that Sarah Cole was bought by Campbell from the\r\nIndians at Carleton Island (near Kingston) it seems likely that\r\nFrancis Cole was her brother or some other relation. That Adams says\r\nnothing of Sarah is not at all strange.\r\n\r\nThe Mississagua Indians occupied a great part of the territory now the\r\nProvince of Ontario and were always loyal to the British Crown.\r\n\r\n[30] In the \"Return of Prisoners whoa have requested leave to remain\r\nin the Province made at Quebec, November 3, 1782,\" appear the names of\r\n\"Mich. & Phoebe Roach to remain at Montreal to receive a child with\r\nthe Savages and a man at Carleton Island.\" These were white. The\r\nReport of the Negroes follows. _Canadian Archives_, B. 163, p. 258.\r\n\r\n[31] The York Shilling (or shilling in New York currency) was 12-1/2\r\ncents, one eighth of a dollar.\r\n\r\n[32] $5.00 for the rum; $3.00 for the Keggs.\r\n\r\n[33] _Canadian Archives_, B. 216, pp. 14, sqq.\r\n\r\nNo proceedings seem to have been taken on this Petition and it is\r\nprobable that Mr. Adams had to stand the loss on Francis Cole the said\r\nYankee Boy as Campbell did on Sarah Cole of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nIndians were not the only slavers. As soon as the Declaration of\r\nIndependence was promulgated, if not before, Boston began to fit out\r\nprivateers to prey on British trade. We read of four privateers\r\nreported by Governor Montague as seen in the Straits of Belle Island\r\nin 1776, two off Placentia in 1777 and in 1778 committing daily\r\ndepredations on the coast of Newfoundland. They harried the\r\nunprotected fishermen and the farmers of Newfoundland and Labrador but\r\nsome at least of them went further. Those who had demanded political\r\nfreedom themselves denied even personal freedom to others. They seized\r\nand carried away into slavery some of the unoffending natives, the\r\nEskimos, who were freemen and whose only crime was their helplessness.\r\nOne instance will suffice. The _Minerva_ privateer of Boston, Captain\r\nJohn Grimes, Master, mounting 20 nine pounders and manned with 160 men\r\nlanded on Sandwich Bay, Labrador, at Captain George Cartwright's\r\nstation, took his brig, _The Countess of Effingham_, loaded her with\r\nhis fish and provisions and sent her off to Boston. Cartwright not\r\nunnaturally said: \"May the Devil go with them.\" \"The _Minerva_ also\r\ntook away four Eskimo to be made slaves of.\" W. G. Gosling,\r\n_Labrador_, Toronto, n. d., pp. 192, 244, 245, 333.\r\n\r\n[34] See _Canadian Archives_, B. 61, p. 83, where he is called a\r\nNegro. _Ibid._, B. 158, p. 261, where he is called a mulatto.\r\n\r\n[35] _Canadian Archives_, B. 215, p. 236.\r\n\r\n[36] The Definitive Treaty of Peace between the mother country and her\r\nrevolted colonies, now become the United States of America, was signed\r\nat Paris, September 3, 1783, but it had been incubating for months\r\nbefore that date.\r\n\r\n[37] It may not be out of place to give some account of the capture by\r\nIndians of Thomas Ridout, afterwards Surveyor General and Legislative\r\nCouncillor of Upper Canada. His story is given in his own words by his\r\ngranddaughter Lady Edgar in her interesting _Ten Years of Upper\r\nCanada_.\r\n\r\nThomas Ridout, born in Dorsetshire, when twenty years of age came to\r\nGeorgia in 1774. After trading for a few years he left Annapolis,\r\nMaryland, in 1787 for Kentucky with letters of introduction from\r\nGeorge Washington, Colonel Lee of Virginia and other gentlemen of\r\nstanding. Sailing with Mr. Purviance, his man James Black and two\r\nother men towards the Falls of the Ohio, the party was taken by a band\r\nof about twenty Indians. Ridout was claimed by an elderly man,\r\napparently a chief, who protected him from injury, but could not save\r\nhis hat, coat and waistcoat. Soon he saw tied two other young men who\r\nhad been taken that morning and set aside for death. Ridout was able\r\nto secure their release. The Indians were Shawanese, Pottawatamies,\r\nOttawas and Cherokees. One prisoner, William Richardson Watson, said\r\nto be an Englishman but who had lived for some years in the United\r\nStates, they robbed of 700 guineas and then burnt to death. Purviance,\r\nthey beat to death but Ridout was saved by the Indian who claimed him\r\nas his own. A white man, Nash, about twenty-two who had been taken by\r\nthe Indians when a child and had become a chief, encouraged him and\r\ntold him that he would be taken to Detroit where he could ransom\r\nhimself. He was more than once within a hairsbreadth of death but at\r\nlength he was brought by his master, Kakinathucca, to his home. He was\r\na great hunter and went every year to Detroit with his furs for sale,\r\ntaking with him his wife Metsigemawa and a Negro slave. The chief had\r\na daughter Altewesa, about eighteen years of age \"of a very agreeable\r\nform and manners.\" She saved Ridout from death from the uplifted hand\r\nof an Indian who had his hand over him ready to strike the fatal blow\r\nwith his tomahawk.\r\n\r\nAt the end of three weeks the whole village set off for the Wabash.\r\nArriving at the Wabash his papers were read by the interpreter, a\r\nwhite man who had been taken prisoner several years before and held in\r\ncaptivity. The Indians were assured that Ridout was an Englishman and\r\nnot an American and they consented that he might go with his master to\r\nDetroit for ransom. The Indians were excessively enraged at the\r\nAmericans who they claimed were the cause of their misfortunes. The\r\npreceding autumn the Americans had come to their village on the Scito\r\nRiver from Kentucky and in times of profound peace and by surprise\r\ndestroyed their village and many of their people, their cattle, grain\r\nand everything they could lay their hands on.\r\n\r\nRidout witnessed the torture and heard the dying shrieks of an\r\nAmerican prisoner Mitchell who had been captured with his father\r\nCaptain Mitchell on the Ohio. The father had been liberated but the\r\nson given to a warrior who was determined to burn him.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four days, Ridout's master collected his horses and\r\npeltry and with his wife the Negro and Ridout set out for Detroit. On\r\nthe way there were met other Indians among whom was the noted Simon\r\nGirty. A council was held at which the murderer of Mitchell claimed\r\nRidout as his but at length Kakinathucca prevailed and Ridout's life\r\nwas again spared. The murderer asserted that he was a spy but his\r\npapers proved his innocence. The little party went on to Fort Miami\r\nwhere several English and French gentlemen received Ridout with open\r\narms. Mr. Sharpe clothed him and a French gentlemen lent a canoe to\r\ncarry the party and furs 250 miles by water to Detroit. Reaching\r\nDetroit, which, it should be remembered, remained in British hands\r\nuntil August 1796, he was received with every attention and a bed was\r\nprovided for him at Government House. The officers furnished him with\r\nmoney and gave him a passage to Montreal where he arrived about the\r\nmiddle of July, 1788. Ridout settled in Upper Canada. In 1799,\r\nKakinathucca and three other Shawanese chiefs came to pay him a visit\r\nat York, (Toronto), and were hospitably treated, the great and good\r\nKakinathucca receiving substantial testimony of the gratitude of the\r\nman he had saved from a death of torture.\r\n\r\nRidout's memorandum of the fate of the other prisoners is terribly\r\nsignificant: \"Samuel Purviance, Killed; Barland, Killed; Wm. R.\r\nWatson, burnt; James Black, beat to death; Symonds, burnt; Ferguson,\r\nsold for corn; a negro woman unharmed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nAFTER THE PEACE\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the summer of 1782, Haldimand received orders from Sir Guy\r\nCarleton then in New York to act only on the defensive. This was due\r\nto the negotiations for peace being on the way, and from that time it\r\nmay fairly be said that Canada was at peace.\r\n\r\nOne slave felt the movement in the air. This was Plato, an old Negro\r\nslave who had been taken in Carleton's operations against Fort George\r\nin 1780 and brought to Montreal where he entered the service of St.\r\nLuc, a personage in those days. Plato had belonged to a Mr. Stringer\r\nwho, the slave always asserted, never joined the rebels. But when, on\r\nNovember 3, 1782, there was made by the Commissary of Prisoners at\r\nQuebec a return of the prisoners who had requested to remain in the\r\nprovince, Plato's name appeared in the list. The next year he changed\r\nhis mind and on July, 17, 1783, he presented a petition to Haldimand\r\nasking him to \"excuse these few lines from a slave who would wish to\r\ngo again to his own Master and Mistress.\" He added: \"The Gentleman I\r\nam now living with Mr. St. Luc says he is very willing to let me go\r\nwith the first party that sets out from here\" (Montreal).[1] Another\r\nNegro slave Roger Vaneis (Van Ness) who had also been taken at Fort\r\nGeorge declined to go. He was living with Lieutenant Johnson and was\r\nto have his freedom on serving for a time already about completed.[2]\r\n\r\nThe declaration of peace, however, brought many more slaves into\r\nCanada. Even before the treaty was signed some of those who had kept\r\ntheir faith to England's crown and desired to live and die under the\r\nold flag made their way to the north. After the peace when the cause\r\nwas lost, many thousands came. Many of these had been slaveholders and\r\nthey brought their slaves with them. Some settled in what was\r\nafterwards Lower Canada in Sorel and elsewhere, some in the upper\r\ncountry, around Cornwall, Kingston, and Niagara, and a very few\r\ncrossed the river at Detroit.[3]\r\n\r\nReturns made about the time show a large number of\r\nslaves--euphemistically disguised as _servants_ in some cases. A\r\nReport of 1784 shows 14 near Cataraqui (Kingston). Another of the same\r\nyear for the new townships on the River St. Lawrence beginning at\r\nTownship No. 1, on Lake St. Francis and running upwards, gives\r\n\r\n  1st Battn. late King's R. Rifles                 25\r\n    Tps. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\r\n\r\n  Part Major Jessup's Corps                        12\r\n    Tps. 6, 7 & pt. 8.\r\n\r\n  2nd Battn.\r\n    Tps. 3, 4, Cataraqui                           10\r\n\r\n  Capt.

In 1784 the first census in which slaves were\r\ncounted was made. In the District of Quebec there were 88, in the\r\nDistrict of Trois Rivieres 4, and in the District of Montreal 212. In\r\nwhat was afterwards the Province of Lower Canada there were in all\r\n304.\r\n\r\nThe sale and marriage of Negro slaves continued to be[7] recorded. For\r\nexample, there are extant two notarial acts of sale of a female Negro\r\nslave called Peg, June 9, 1783 from Elias Smith to James Finlay and\r\nMay 14, 1788 from Finlay to Patrick Langan. In each case the price was\r\nL50[8]. On January 20, 1785 there took place at Christ Church the\r\nmarriage of Francis and Jane both slaves to Colonel Campbell. On March\r\n9, 1785, there was a sale of a female Negro slave named Sarah, by\r\nJames Morison, merchant, as agent for Hugh McAdam, of Saratoga, New\r\nYork, to Charles Lepallieur, Clerk of the Court of Common Pleas. The\r\nprice was 36 louis. On April 1, 1785 Elizah Cady of New York, sold to\r\nWilliam Ward of Vermont, four Negroes: Tobi 24 years, Joseph 20 years,\r\nSarah 19 years and a child six months, the price being 250 louis. On\r\nApril 26, William Ward sold three of these slaves at Montreal to\r\nWilliam Campbell--that is Tobi, Sarah and the child for $425. On May\r\n6, William Campbell sold these three slaves to Dr. Charles Blake for\r\n$300.\r\n\r\nOn September 5, there followed the sale of a Pani slave called\r\nCharlotte, aged eighteen years, by Dame Marie-Josephe Deguire, widow\r\nof Jean-Etienne Waden, to Jacob Schieffelin, auctioneer, for 21 louis.\r\nThe said slave had been brought from Upper Canada by Mr. Waden in\r\n1776. To increase her value it was said that the slave had had the\r\nmeasles and the small-pox and was not scrofulous nor had any other\r\ndefect.\r\n\r\nOn January 22, 1786, there took place at Christ Church the marriage of\r\nthe slaves, Thomas York and Margaret McCloud. On March 17, 1787,\r\nSamuel Mix, Merchant of Saint-Jean on the Richelieu, sold to Louis\r\nGauthier, merchant tanner of the Faubourg Saint Laurent, a female\r\nNegro slave named Rose aged 14 years for the sum of 40 louis. On June\r\n6, 1789, Charles Lepallieur resold to James Morison the female Negro\r\nslave Sarah whom he had sold to him in 1785. The price was 36 louis.\r\nOn the sixth of June James Morison sold the same Sarah for 50 louis to\r\nJoseph Andrews, at a profit of 14 louis. On April 3, 1790 there was a\r\nsale by Oliver Hasting to M. le chevalier Chs. Boucher de la Bruere,\r\nde Boucherville, of a Negro of the name of Antoine, aged eight years\r\nand a half. The price was 90 minots de ble. On September 9, 1791\r\nfollowed the sale at auction of the female Negro slave Rose, aged 19\r\nyears, by William Matthews, merchant of Sorel, to Lambert Saint-Omer,\r\nMerchant of Montreal, for 38 louis and 5 shillings. This slave had\r\nalready belonged to S. Mix as set forth above.\r\n\r\nAlexander Campbell writing from Montreal August 16, 1784, to Major\r\nMathews says that having sent to Albany to recover some of his debts,\r\nAdam Fondea of Cauchnawago of Tryon's County gave as an excuse for not\r\npaying his debt that a certain Negro woman named Dine born in his own\r\nfamily and his actual property was taken away from his house by\r\nCaptain Samuel Anderson of Sir John Johnson's First Batallion, and was\r\nstill detained by him as his property. Fondea being willing to pay the\r\ndebt had sent a power of attorney to take his slave, sell her and pay\r\nthe debt with the proceeds. Campbell asked that the governor should\r\norder Dine to be seized and sold as no Magistrate had the power or the\r\ninclination to give such an order. No attention seems to have been\r\npaid to this request.\r\n\r\nOn September 15, 1784, James Doty writing also from Montreal says that\r\n\"with some difficulty to myself I have ... purchased a Negro boy from\r\nLieut. Clench of the Indian Department which boy has been allowed his\r\nprovisions drawn at Cataraqui (Kingston) from the time of his first\r\ncoming into the Province with other Loyalists from N. York last year.\"\r\nHe asked to have this allowance continued. There was no answer. The\r\nreport of settlers near Cataraqui for this year gave 3 \"servants\" and\r\nnear Oswegatchie 11. But the importation of Slaves was not encouraged\r\nindiscriminately.[10]\r\n\r\nThe accustomed abuses were not wanting. In an action Poiree v. Lagord\r\nin the Court of Common Pleas at Montreal July 1788, it was proved that\r\nLagord had sold to Poiree in September, 1787, a free Negro for L37.6.\r\nHe was ordered to repay the price with interest. Another and more\r\ncelebrated case was that of the Negro Nero. In 1780 Haldimand sent a\r\ndetachment of troops accompanied by Mohawk Indians to attack Ballstown\r\nand the Saratoga region. They captured a number of Negroes some of\r\nthem the slaves of Colonel Gordon of the American service. These were\r\nclaimed by the white men and Indians, and as was the custom, they were\r\nbrought to Montreal and sold. One Negro called Dublin was known to be\r\nfree. He was liberated and enlisted in the army. Lieutenant Patrick\r\nLangan acted as agent for the Indians and sold Nero to John Mittberger\r\nfor L60 December 5, 1780. Claiming the Negro as a prisoner of war\r\nGeneral Allan Maclean imprisoned him \"in the public Provot.\" He made\r\nhis escape and went to his master Colonel Gordon and Mittleberger sued\r\nLangan in 1788 for the price and for damages. In January 1789 he was\r\nawarded judgment for the L60 and interest.[11] About the same time\r\nRossiter Hoyle, attorney for the trustees of Mary Jacobs, obtained a\r\njudgment in the Court of Common Pleas at Montreal that Donald Fisher\r\nand Elizabeth his wife should forthwith deliver \"two negro women, the\r\none named Silvia Jane, the other Ruth Jane,\" which said Negro women,\r\nthey had sold to Mary Jacobs by a notarial deed for L50 or pay L50\r\nwith costs.[12]\r\n\r\nThere are also in existence advertisements for the sale of Negroes. In\r\nthe _Quebec Gazette_ of March 18, 1784, is the advertisement of the\r\nsale of a female Negro slave, price to be obtained on inquiry of\r\nMadame Perrault. In the issue of March 25, 1785, there is advertised\r\nfor sale a Negro of about twenty-five years of age who has had the\r\nsmallpox. There appear also a few advertisements for runaway slaves.\r\n\r\nThere arose also some complaints like the following: In 1784 there was\r\npresented at Quebec to Sir Frederick Haldimand, Governor in Chief, a\r\npetition from John Black showing that the petitioner hath served as a\r\nseaman in His Majesty's service on board the sloop, _Happy Couple_ of\r\nNew York for which he had a certificate to shew, and was then living\r\nservant to Mrs. Martin, the wife of Captain Martin of this place, who\r\nwanted to deprive him of his liberty and humbly begged His Excellency\r\nto grant him a passport.[13]\r\n\r\nThe immigration into Canada of those who had been British subjects was\r\nardently desired by the home authorities. To encourage this\r\nimmigration, the Imperial Parliament in 1790 passed an Act[14] which\r\nhad some effect in increasing the slave population. Intended to\r\nencourage \"new settlers in His Majesty's Colonies and Plantations in\r\nAmerica,\" it applied to all \"subjects of the United States.\" It\r\nallowed an importation into any of the Bahama, Bermuda or Somers\r\nIslands, the province of Quebec (then including all Canada), Nova\r\nScotia and every other British territory in North America. It allowed\r\nthe importation by such American subjects of \"Negroes, household\r\nfurniture, utensils of husbandry or cloathing free of duty,\" the\r\n\"household furniture, utensils of husbandry and cloathing\" not to\r\nexceed in value L50 for every white person in the family and L2 for\r\neach Negro, any sale of Negro or goods within a year of the\r\nimportation to be void. After the division of the Old Province of\r\nQuebec into Upper and Lower Canada in 1791 the course of slavery was\r\ndifferent.[15]\r\n\r\nIt seems appropriate to close this chapter by adding a number of\r\navailable advertisements including some of runaway apprentices.[16]\r\n\r\n     Il s'est enfui de chez les Soussignes, la nuit du 12 du courant,\r\n     Un Negre Esclave nomme POMPE d'environ cinq pieds cinq pouces\r\n     d'hauteur, robuste, il a ete achete dernierement de M.

Technically and in law, the new province was formed by\r\nOrder in Council, August 24, 1791, but there was no change in\r\nadministration until December 26, 1791.\r\n\r\n[16] These I owe to the kindness of the officers of the Canadian\r\nArchives Department of Ottawa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nLOWER CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Province of Lower Canada continued the former law--in criminal\r\nmatters, the English law, in civil matters the French law. It was not\r\nlong before the status of the slave became a burning issue. At the\r\nfirst session of the first Parliament[1] of the new Province Lower\r\nCanada, Mr. P. L. Panet, a member of the House of Assembly, moved\r\n(January 28, 1793) for leave to introduce a bill for the abolition of\r\nslavery in the province and leave was unanimously given. On the\r\ntwenty-sixth of February, Panet introduced a bill pursuant to leave\r\ngiven, and it was read in French and in English. On the eighth of\r\nMarch, Mr. B. Panet proposed the first reading of the bill and it was\r\nso read. On the nineteenth of April Mr. P. L. Panet moved that the\r\nbill be taken into consideration by the Committee of the Whole on the\r\nfollowing Tuesday. The motion was debated and Mr. Debonne moved an\r\namendment to table the bill, which was carried 31 to 3.[2] There was\r\nno further effort toward legislative dealing with slavery until\r\n1799.[3]\r\n\r\nThe sale of Negroes continued as indicated by the records.[4] On the\r\ntwelfth of May, 1794, Francois Boucher de la Periere and Marie Pecaudy\r\nde Contrecoeur, his wife, gave liberty to James, their Negro slave,\r\naged 21 years, on condition that he should live in the most remote\r\nparts of the upper country. If, however, he left those parts, he\r\nshould return to slavery. On the fifteenth of December, 1795, Frs.\r\nDumoulin, merchant of Bout de l'ile sold to Myer Michaels, merchant, a\r\nmulatto named Prince, aged 18 years, for the price of 50 louis.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of January, 1796 there was found a bill of sale of a\r\nfemale Negro slave named Rose, dated January 15, 1794, the vendor\r\nbeing P. Byrne, the purchaser Simon Meloche, for the price of 360\r\nshillings, deposited with the Notary J. P. Delisle. On the third of\r\nSeptember John Shuter by notarial act promised his Negro, Jack, to\r\ngive him his liberty in six years, if, in the meantime, he served him\r\nfaithfully. Later, on November 2, 1803, Shuter declared that Jack had\r\nfulfilled his obligation, and he accordingly emancipated him. On the\r\nthirteenth of September, J. B. Routier, merchant of the Faubourg\r\nSaint-Antoine, sold to Louis Charles Foucher, Solicitor-General of His\r\nMajesty, Jean Louis, a mulatto, aged 27 years, height 5' 10\", the\r\nprice being 1300 shillings. Routier declared that he had bought Jean\r\nLouis as well as his mother at the Island of Saint-Domingue in 1778.\r\nOn the twenty-third of November Cesar, a free Negro of New London,\r\nConnecticut, engaged for ten years as a domestic to Dr. John Aussem,\r\nliving in the Faubourg Saint Antoine, with a salary of 30 louis in\r\nadvance. Dr. Aussem reserved to himself the right to sell the services\r\nof his domestic to whomsoever he pleased during the ten years.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-fifth of May, 1797 Dame Marie-Catherine Tessier, Widow\r\nof Antoine Janisse, in his lifetime a voyager, liberated her slave\r\nMarie Antoine de Pade, an Indian, aged 23 years, in recognition of her\r\nservices which she had rendered her, and in addition gave her a\r\ntrousseau. On the twenty-fifth of August Thomas Blaney, gold painter,\r\nsold to Thomas John Sullivan, hotel-keeper of Montreal, the Negro\r\nManuel about 33 years old for 36 louis, payable in monthly instalments\r\nof three louis each. On the same date and before the same notary,\r\nSullivan promised the slave to liberate him in 5 years, if he served\r\nhim faithfully. On the twenty-second of November George Westphall,\r\nformerly Lieutenant of the 6th Regiment, who owed 20 louis to Richard\r\nDillon, proprietor of the Montreal Hotel in security for payment,\r\ndelivered to his creditor a mulatress, a slave called Ledy, aged 26\r\nyears. She was to work with Mr. Dillon until he was repaid what was\r\nowed him by Westphall for principal and interest.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1793, there came up in the Court of Appeal at Quebec a\r\ncase involving slavery but nothing was really decided. The plaintiff\r\nJacob Smith sued Peter McFarlane in the Court of Common Pleas for\r\ntaking away his wife and her clothes and detaining them. McFarlane\r\nclaimed that Smith's wife was his slave. The Court of Common Pleas\r\ngave the plaintiff judgment for L100 and McFarlane appealed to the\r\nCourt of Appeal. The Court pointed out that it was for McFarlane to\r\nprove that Smith's wife was his slave and that he had not done so: but\r\nas there had been error in the proceedings the case was sent back to\r\nbe retried. It is important to notice that the court considered that\r\nif McFarlane could prove that Smith's wife was his slave, he had the\r\nright to take her away.[5]\r\n\r\nA lawsuit also arose over the Negro Manuel (Allen) sold August 25,\r\n1797, to Thomas John Sullivan. When Blaney sold him for L36 Sullivan\r\npaid down only half and the balance with interest L30.15.2 was sued\r\nfor in the Court of King's Bench at Montreal in 1798. Sullivan pleaded\r\nthat Manuel was not the plaintiff's slave but a free Negro and that\r\nhe had run away March, 1798, at Montreal where he continued to be: and\r\nSullivan claimed to be reimbursed the L18 which he had paid. On the\r\nsixth of October Manuel himself came into the suit and claimed that\r\n\"by the laws of this land he is not a slave but a freeman.\" Evidence\r\nwas given that he had absconded from Sullivan's service alleging as a\r\nreason that he was a freeman, \"that other blacks were free and that he\r\nwanted to be free also.\" In February, 1799, the court held that no\r\ntitle or right to sell Manuel has been shown and dismissed the action\r\ndirecting the return of the L18.[6]\r\n\r\nIn 1797 the Imperial Act of 1732 for the sale of Negroes and other\r\nhereditaments for debt in the American Plantations was repealed so far\r\nas it related to Negroes[7] but this made no difference in their\r\nstatus. The courts, however, were becoming astute in favor of\r\nassisting those claiming freedom. In February, 1798, a certain female\r\nNegro slave called Charlotte belonging to Miss Jane Cook left her\r\nmistress and refused to return. On information laid she was committed\r\nby the magistrates to prison. She sued out a writ of habeas corpus\r\nfrom the Court of King's Bench at Montreal and Chief Justice, James\r\nMonk, ordered her release. On this becoming known, the Negroes of the\r\ncity and district of Montreal became very threatening in their\r\ndemeanor. Many renounced all service and one woman called Jude who had\r\nbeen bought at Albany in 1795 for L80 by Elias Smith, a merchant of\r\nMontreal, left her master and was committed to prison in the same way\r\nby the magistrates. Being brought up in the Court of King's Bench at\r\nMontreal on habeas corpus, Chief Justice Monk discharged her March 8,\r\n1798 without deciding the question of slavery. The Chief Justice\r\ndeclared that he would set free every Negro, articled apprentice, or\r\ndomestic servant who should be committed to prison in this way by the\r\nmagistrates. But this was because the statute in force at that\r\ntime[8] gave power to the magistrates to cause such due correction and\r\npunishment to be ministered to an apprentice as they thought fit and\r\nthis empowered them to commit apprentices to the house of correction\r\nas a punishment, but it gave no authority to commit to a common gaol\r\nor other prison.\r\n\r\nThese decisions alarmed the owners of slaves: and a petition from many\r\ninhabitants of Montreal was presented to the House of Assembly April\r\n19, 1799, by Joseph Papineau. This petition set forth the ordinance of\r\nthe Intendant Raudot in 1709[9] the Act of 1732,[10] that of 1790,[11]\r\nthe facts concerning Charlotte, Jude and the other Negroes, the\r\njudgments of Chief Justice Monk, and the absence of any house of\r\ncorrection. It prayed that an Act should be passed that until a house\r\nof correction should be established every slave, Panis or Negro who\r\nshould desert the service of his master, might be proceeded against in\r\nthe same way as apprentices in England, and be committed to the common\r\ngaol of the District; and further that no one should aid or receive a\r\ndeserting slave or that there should be passed a law declaring that\r\nthere was no slavery in the Province or such other provision\r\nconcerning slaves should be made as the House should deem\r\nconvenient.[12] The petition was laid on the table.\r\n\r\nIn 1799 there was passed an Act providing houses of correction for\r\nseveral districts, but no provision was made concerning slavery.\r\nPerhaps the wisdom of this house proved insufficient to devise any\r\n\"provision convenable.\"\r\n\r\nThe next year another petition was brought in by Papineau from certain\r\ninhabitants of the District of Montreal saying that doubts had been\r\nentertained how far property in Negroes and Panis was sustainable\r\nunder the laws of the province. They cited Raudot's ordinance, the\r\nrecognition of slavery for years, and stated that in a recent case the\r\nCourt of King's Bench at Montreal in discharging a slave of Mr.\r\nFraser's who had been committed to the house of correction by three\r\njustices of the peace, had expressed the opinion that the Act of\r\n1797[13] had repealed all the laws concerning slavery. They asked that\r\nthe House should pass an act declaring that with certain restrictions\r\nslavery did exist in the province and investing the owners with full\r\nproperty in the slave; and that this chamber should also pass such\r\nlaws and regulations in the matter as should be thought advisable.[14]\r\n\r\nThe petition on motion of Messrs. Papineau and Black was referred to a\r\ncommittee of five, Papineau, Grant, Craigie, Cuthbert and Dumas. The\r\ncommittee reported and Cuthbert introduced on April 30, 1800, a bill\r\nto regulate the condition of slaves, to limit the term of their\r\nslavery and to prevent further introduction of slavery in the\r\nprovince. The bill passed the second reading and was referred to the\r\nCommittee of the Whole, but got no further. The next year Cuthbert\r\nintroduced a similar bill with the same result, and again in 1803. The\r\nreason for the failure of these attempts was that any legislation on\r\nslavery would in view of the decisions of the courts be reactionary\r\nand change for the worse the condition of the slave.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of these decisions was in the case of Robin,\r\n_alias_ Robert, a black. James Fraser, a Loyalist of the colony of New\r\nYork, became the owner of Robin a Negro man in 1773, before the\r\nAmerican Revolution. The colonies were successful and provisional\r\narticles of peace were signed November 30, 1782. Congress proclaimed\r\nthem April 11, 1783 and it was almost inevitable that they would\r\nbecome a permanent and definitive treaty. Article VII provided for the\r\nspeedy evacuation by the British forces of territory to be allotted to\r\nthe United States of America \"without carrying away any negroes or\r\nother property of the American inhabitants.\" There was allowed full\r\ntime for everyone who desired to live under the British flag to leave\r\nNew York. James Fraser made up his mind to go to Nova Scotia and\r\nobtained a pass from William Walton, the Magistrate of Police of the\r\ncity, for his slave Robin and another, Lydia, September 23, 1783.[15]\r\nFraser went to Shelborne, Nova Scotia, and the following year in\r\nSeptember he went to \"the Island of St. John,\"[16] accompanied by\r\nRobin who was and acknowledged himself to be Fraser's property.\r\nAfterwards Fraser brought him to the Current of Saint Mary near the\r\ncity of Montreal where Fraser became a farmer. Robin, infected with\r\nthe pernicious doctrines of freedom then rather prevalent left Fraser,\r\nMarch 19, 1799, and went to live with Richard, a tavern keeper in\r\nMontreal. Fraser laid an Information before Charles Blake, a justice\r\nof the peace, and January 31, 1800, Charles Blake, Robert Jones and\r\nJames Dunlop, justices of the peace of the District of Montreal\r\ncommitted Robin to the \"Common Gaol and House of Correction at\r\nMontreal\" with a warrant to Jacob Kuhn \"Keeper of His Majesty's Jail\r\nand House of Correction\" to receive \"a negroman named Robert who\r\nrefuses to go home to his owner and him safely to keep till he may be\r\ndischarged or otherwise dealt with according to law.\"\r\n\r\nIn the February Term 1800 of the Court of King's Bench for the\r\nDistrict of Montreal[17] Mr. A. Perry, his advocate, obtained a writ\r\nof habeas corpus and on the tenth of February the black was produced\r\nin court. Mr. Perry for the black and Mr. Kerr for James Fraser\r\npresented their arguments upon this day and on the thirteenth of\r\nFebruary, and after consideration and consultation the court five days\r\nlater ordered the discharge of Robin alias Robert from his confinement\r\nunder the warrant.[18]\r\n\r\nThe decision proceeded on the ground that the Act of 1797 which\r\nrepealed the provision for the sale of Negroes to answer a judgment\r\nhad revoked all the laws concerning slavery. Remembering that the Act\r\nof 1732 was intended to change the common law of England which did not\r\nallow the sale of land under a writ of execution, fieri facias, it\r\nshould probably be considered that the sole effect of the repeal of\r\nthe act as regards Negroes was to exempt them from sale under fieri\r\nfacias, without affecting their status. And it is well known that\r\nslavery continued in the West India Islands and in Upper Canada long\r\nafter the Act of 1797.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the decisions while not technically abolishing slavery\r\nrendered it innocuous. The slave could not be compelled to serve\r\nlonger than he would, and the burden of slavery was rather on the\r\nmaster who must support his slave than on the slave who might leave\r\nhis master at will. The legislature refusing to interfere, the law of\r\nslavery continued in this state until the year 1833 when the Imperial\r\nParliament passed the celebrated act which forever abolished slavery\r\nin British Colonies from and after August 1, 1834.[19]\r\n\r\nAs Lower Canada passed no legislation on slavery, the extradition of\r\nfugitives was made impossible and Canada became therefore an asylum\r\nfor the oppressed in the United States. Before the Act of 1833 there\r\nwas one instance of a request from the Secretary of State of the\r\nUnited States for the delivery up of a slave. The matter was referred\r\nto the Executive Council by Sir James Kempt, the Administrator of the\r\nGovernment.[20] The report of the Executive Council shows the view\r\nheld that \"the Law of Canada does not admit a slave to be a subject of\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Executive Council of the Province of Lower Canada\r\nheld at the Council Chamber in the Castle of St. Lewis, on Thursday,\r\nJune 18, 1829, under Sir James Kempt, the Administrator of the\r\nGovernment, the following proceedings were had:\r\n\r\n     \"Report of a Committee of the whole Council Present The Honble.\r\n     the Chief Justice in the Chair, Mr. Smith, Mr. DeLery, Mr.\r\n     Stewart, and Mr. Cochran on Your Excellency's reference of a\r\n     letter from the American Secretary of State requesting that Paul\r\n     Vallard accused of having stolen a Mulatto Slave from the State\r\n     of Illinois may be delivered up to the Government of the United\r\n     States of America together with the Slave.\r\n\r\n     \"May it please Your Excellency,\r\n\r\n     \"The Committee have proceeded to the consideration of the subject\r\n     matter of this reference with every wish and disposition to aid\r\n     the Officers of the Government of the United States of America in\r\n     the execution of the laws of that dominion and they regret\r\n     therefore the more that the present application cannot in their\r\n     opinion be acceded to.\r\n\r\n     \"In the former cases the Committee have acted upon the principle\r\n     which now seems to be generally understood that whenever a crime\r\n     has been committed and the perpetrator is punishable according to\r\n     the _Lex Loci_ of the country in which it is committed, the\r\n     country in which he is found may rightfully aid the police of the\r\n     country against which the crime was committed in bringing the\r\n     criminal to justice--and upon this ground have recommended that\r\n     fugitives from the United States should be delivered up.\r\n\r\n     \"But the Committee conceive that the crimes for which they are\r\n     authorized to recommend the arrest of individuals who have fled\r\n     from other Countries must be such as are _mala in se_, and are\r\n     universally admitted to be crimes in every nation, and that the\r\n     offence of the individual whose person is demanded must be such\r\n     as to render him liable to arrest by the law of Canada as well as\r\n     by the law of the United States.\r\n\r\n     \"The state of slavery is not recognized by the law of Canada nor\r\n     does the law admit that any man can be the proprietor of\r\n     another.\r\n\r\n     \"Every slave therefore who comes into the province is immediately\r\n     free whether he has been brought in by violence or has entered it\r\n     of his own accord; and his liberty cannot from thenceforth be\r\n     lawfully infringed without some cause for which the law of Canada\r\n     has directed an arrest.\r\n\r\n     \"On the other hand, the Individual from whom he has been taken\r\n     cannot pretend that the slave has been stolen from him in as much\r\n     as the law of Canada does not admit a slave to be a subject of\r\n     property.\r\n\r\n     \"All of which is respectfully submitted to Your Excellency's\r\n     Wisdom.\"[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Under the Canada Act of 1791, the provinces had each a parliament\r\nor legislature, an upper house, the Legislative Council, of nominated\r\nmembers, not fewer than seven in Upper and not fewer than fifteen in\r\nLower Canada, and a lower house, the House of Assembly, sometimes\r\ncalled the House of Commons elected by the people, not fewer than\r\nsixteen in Upper and not fewer than fifty in Lower Canada.\r\n\r\n[2] In the sister province a bill to the same effect was more\r\nfortunate in the same year a little later. This will be considered in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n[3] In a work of some authority, Bibaud's _Pantheon Canadien_, page\r\n211, it is said that \"Joseph Papineau, Notary Public, Member of the\r\nLegislature Assembly for Upper Quebec presented about 1797 a petition\r\nof the citizens of Montreal for the abolition of slavery.\" If that be\r\nthe case there was nothing done on the petition, but it seems probable\r\nthat the author refers to the petition of 1799 spoken of later in the\r\nText.\r\n\r\n[4] From Massicotte _ut supra_ in _Le Bulletin des Recherches\r\nHistoriques_, Vol. II, p. 136, it is said: \"Une annonce publiee dans\r\nla Gazette de Quebec vers: cette epoque (_i.e._, 1797) represente un\r\nnegre courant a toutes jambes. 'Il est offert une recompense honnete a\r\nqui remenera a son maitre marchand de Trois Rivieres son esclave\r\nfugitif' Ce pauvre diable pensait sans doute que la loi qu'on\r\nproposait pourrait pas d'effet retroactif.\"\r\n\r\n[5] Lafontaine _ut supra_, pp. 49-51.\r\n\r\n[6] Lafontaine _ut supra_, pp. 52 & 56.\r\n\r\n[7] For the Act of 1732 (5 George II, c. 7). The repealing Act was\r\n(1797) 37 George III, c. 119 (Imp.).\r\n\r\n[8] The Statute of 1562, 5 Elizabeth, c. 4, not repealed until 1814,\r\n54 George III, c. 96 (Imp.).\r\n\r\n[9] See ante, p. 304.\r\n\r\n[10] _Ibid._, p. 305.\r\n\r\n[11] _Ibid._, p. 310.\r\n\r\n[12] \"Ou qu'une loi puisse etre passee declarant qu'il n'y a point\r\nd'esclavage dans la Province; ou telle autre provision concernant les\r\nesclaves que cette Chambre, dans sa sagesse, jugera convenable.\" The\r\nAct of 1799 providing for houses of correction (really the common\r\ngaol) was 39 George II, c. 6 (L. C.), and was to be in force for two\r\nyears. It was amended and continued for four years by the Act (1802)\r\n42 George III, c. 6 (L. C.) and again by (1806) 46 George III, c. 6\r\n(L. C.), until January 1, 1810 when it expired.\r\n\r\n[13] See ante, note 7. The effect of this Act was probably not as\r\nstated. The slave of Mr. Fraser's was Robin alias Robert to be spoken\r\nof _infra_, page.\r\n\r\n[14] The two reasons given for the request are the familiar ones. The\r\npetitioners had paid large sums for the slaves who had left them and\r\n\"they are all wholly convinced that that class of men really lazy\r\nleading an idle and abandoned life would attempt to commit crime.\"\r\n\r\n[15] The definitive treaty was in fact signed September 3, 1783, but\r\nnot ratified by Congress until January 14, 1784. The armistice had\r\nbeen concluded January 20, 1783. In the definitive treaty, Article VII\r\ncontains the same provisions as to Negroes as the corresponding\r\narticle in the preliminary articles.\r\n\r\n[16] Isle St. Jean so called from about the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury until 1798, when it was given the name Prince Edward Island\r\nout of compliment to Prince Edward, Duke of Kent (father of Queen\r\nVictoria), then commanding the British Forces in North America. The\r\nname it still retains.\r\n\r\n[17] The Judges were James Monk, Chief Justice and Pierre Louis Panet\r\nand Isaac Ogden, Puisne Justices.\r\n\r\n[18] Lafontaine ut supra, pp. 56-63. It has often been said that it\r\nwas Chief Justice Osgoode who gave the death blow to slavery in Lower\r\nCanada. For example, in James P. Taylor's _Cardinal facts of Canadian\r\nHistory_, Toronto, 1899, on p. 88 we find a statement that in 1803,\r\nChief Justice Osgoode in Montreal declared slavery inconsistent with\r\nthe laws of Canada. But Osgoode became Chief Justice of the Province\r\nin July, 1794. Continuing as such Chief Justice, he became Chief of\r\nthe Court of King's Bench for the District of Quebec later on in the\r\nsame year on the coming into force of the Act of 1794, 34 George III,\r\nc. 6, which erected two Courts of King's Bench one for each District.\r\nJames Monk became Chief Justice of the Court of King's Bench for the\r\nDistrict of Montreal, which position he retained until 1825. Osgoode\r\nresigned his position and went to England in 1801 and lived in England\r\nuntil his death in 1824: he was never Chief Justice at Montreal.\r\n\r\n[19] One result of these decisions was to induce the escape of Negro\r\nslaves from Upper Canada where slavery was lawful to Lower Canada. For\r\nexample one hears of two of the three slaves whom Captain Allan\r\nbrought with him into Upper Canada from New Jersey running away to\r\nMontreal. The owner pursued them to Montreal and searched for them in\r\nvain for ten days. The third slave, a woman, he sold with her child.\r\n\r\nThe Statute is (1833) 3, 4, William IV, c. 73 (Imp.). One result of\r\nthis Act is exceedingly curious and to the philosophical lawyer\r\nexceedingly interesting. Slaves which had been real estate, as soon as\r\nthe act was passed ceased to be such, and the benefit to be obtained\r\nfrom their labor until fully enfranchised and the money to be paid by\r\nthe legislature as compensation for their freedom became personal\r\nestate. See the luminous judgment of the Judicial Committee of the\r\nPrivy Council in Richard _v._ Attorney General of Jamaica, Moore's\r\n_Report of Cases in the Judicial Committee_ (1848), Vol. 6, p. 381.\r\n\r\nIn a note on p. 35 of a paper in the _Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety of Canada_, 1900, on _La Declaration de 1732_ M.

The very\r\nfirst act of this first Parliament of Upper Canada reintroduced the\r\nEnglish civil law.[1] This did not destroy slavery, nor did it\r\nameliorate the condition of the slave. It was rather the reverse, for\r\nas the English law did not, like the civil law of Rome and the systems\r\nfounded on it, recognize the status of the slave at all, when it was\r\nforced by grim fact to acknowledge slavery, it had no room for the\r\nslave except as a mere piece of property. Instead of giving him rights\r\nlike those of the \"servus,\" he was deprived of all rights, marital,\r\nparental, proprietary, even the right to live. In the English law and\r\nsystems founded on it, the slave had no rights which the master was\r\nbound to respect.[2] At one time, indeed, it was understood in the\r\nEnglish colonies that the master had the _jus vitae necisque_ over his\r\nslaves; but at the beginning of the eighteenth century the Crown much\r\nto the anger and disgust of the colonists made the murder of a Negro a\r\ncapital offence, and at least some of the governors vigorously upheld\r\nthis decision.[3]\r\n\r\nUpper Canada was settled almost wholly by United Empire Loyalists who\r\nhad left their homes in the revolted colonies and kept their faith to\r\nthe Crown. Many of them brought their slaves as well as their other\r\nproperty to the new land. The statute of 1790 encouraged this\r\npractice.[4]\r\n\r\nThe first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada was Col. John Graves\r\nSimcoe. He hated slavery and had spoken against it in the House of\r\nCommons in England. Arriving in Upper Canada in the summer of 1792, he\r\nwas soon made fully aware by the Chloe Cooley case that the horrors of\r\nslavery were not unknown in his new province. There came up to the\r\nExecutive Council the complaint that a Negro girl thus named had been\r\ncruelly forced across the border and sold in the United States by one\r\nVroomen. Much indignation was expressed by both citizens and\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General was John White[6] an English lawyer of no great\r\neminence indeed but of sufficient skill to know that the brutal master\r\nwas well within his rights in acting as he did. He had the same right\r\nto bind, export, and sell his slave as to bind, export, and sell his\r\ncow. Chloe Cooley had no rights which Vrooman was bound to respect;\r\nand it was no more a breach of the peace than if he had been dealing\r\nwith his heifer. Nothing came of the direction to prosecute and\r\nnothing could be done unless there should be an actual breach of the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that it was this circumstance which brought about\r\nlegislation. At the second session of the First Parliament which met\r\nat Newark, May 31, 1793, a bill was introduced and unanimously passed\r\nthe House of Assembly. The trifling amendments introduced by the\r\nLegislative Council were speedily concurred in, the royal assent was\r\ngiven July 9, 1793, and the bill became law.[7]\r\n\r\nSimcoe, as was his duty, reported to Henry Dundas afterwards Lord\r\nMelville, Secretary of State for the Home Department concerning this\r\nAct September 28, 1793. Simcoe had discovered that there was much\r\nresistance to the slave law. There were many plausible arguments of\r\nthe demand for labor and the difficulty of obtaining \"Servants to\r\ncultivate Lands.\" \"Some possessed of Negroes,\" said he, \"knowing that\r\nit was very questionable whether any subsisting Law did authorize\r\nSlavery and having purchased several taken in war by the Indians at\r\nsmall prices wished to reject the Bill entirely; others were desirous\r\nto supply themselves by allowing the importation for two years. The\r\nmatter was finally settled by undertaking to secure the property\r\nalready obtained upon condition that an immediate stop should be put\r\nto the importation and that Slavery should be gradually abolished.\"[8]\r\n\r\nThe Act recited that it was unjust that a people who enjoy freedom by\r\nlaw should encourage the introduction of slaves, and that it was\r\nhighly expedient to abolish slavery in the province so far as it could\r\nbe done gradually without violating private property. It repealed the\r\nImperial Statute of 1790 so far as it related to Upper Canada, and to\r\nenact that from and after the passing of the act \"No Negro or other\r\nperson who shall come or be brought into this Province ... shall be\r\nsubject to the condition of a slave or to bounden involuntary service\r\nfor life.\" With that regard for property characteristic of the\r\nEnglish-speaking peoples, the act contained an important proviso\r\nwhich continued the slavery of every \"negro or other person subjected\r\nto such service\" who had been lawfully brought into the province. It\r\nthen enacted that every child born after the passing of the act, of a\r\nNegro mother or other woman subjected to such service, should become\r\nabsolutely free on attaining the age of twenty-five, the master in the\r\nmeantime to provide \"proper nourishment and cloathing\" for the child,\r\nbut to be entitled to put him to work, all issue of such children to\r\nbe free whenever born. It further declared that any voluntary contract\r\nof service or indenture should not be binding longer than nine years.\r\nUpper Canada was the first British possession to provide by\r\nlegislation for the abolition of slavery.[9]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the statute did not put an end to slavery at\r\nonce. Those who were lawfully slaves remained slaves for life unless\r\nmanumitted and the statute rather discouraged manumission, as it\r\nprovided that the master on liberating a slave must give good and\r\nsufficient security that the freed man would not become a public\r\ncharge. But, defective as it was, it was not long without attack. In\r\n1798, Simcoe had left the province never to return, and while the\r\ngovernment was being administered by the timeserving Peter\r\nRussell,[10] a bill was introduced into the Lower House to enable\r\npersons \"migrating into the province to bring their negro slaves with\r\nthem.\" The bill was contested at every stage but finally passed on a\r\nvote of eight to four. In the Legislative Council it received the\r\nthree months' hoist and was never heard of again.[11] The argument in\r\nfavor of the bill was based on the scarcity of labor which all\r\ncontemporary writers speak of, the inducement to intending settlers to\r\ncome to Upper Canada where they would have the same privileges in\r\nrespect of slavery as in New York and elsewhere; in other words the\r\ninevitable appeal to greed.\r\n\r\nAfter this bill became law, slavery gradually disappeared. Public\r\nopinion favored manumission and while there were not many manumissions\r\n_inter vivos_[12] in some measure owing to the provisions of the act\r\nrequiring security to be given in such case against the free man\r\nbecoming a public charge, there were not a few emancipated by\r\nwill.[13]\r\n\r\nThe number of slaves in Upper Canada was also diminished by what seems\r\nat first sight paradoxical, that is, their flight across the Detroit\r\nRiver into American territory. So long as Detroit and its vicinity\r\nwere British in fact and even for some years later, Section 6 of the\r\nOrdinance of 1787 \"that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary\r\nservitude in the said territory otherwise than as punishment of crime\"\r\nwas a dead letter: but when Michigan was incorporated as a territory\r\nin 1805, the Ordinance of 1787 became legally and at least in form\r\neffective. Many slaves made their way from Canada to Detroit, then a\r\nreal land of the free; so many, indeed, that we find that a company of\r\nNegro militia composed entirely of escaped slaves from Canada was\r\nformed in Detroit in 1806 to assist in the general defence of the\r\nterritory.[14]\r\n\r\nThe number of slaves in Upper Canada cannot be ascertained with\r\nanything approaching accuracy. The returns of the census of 1784 show\r\nthat very many of the 212 slaves in the District of Montreal, which\r\nthen extended from the Rivers St. Maurice and Godfrey to the Detroit\r\nRiver _de jure_ and to the Mississippi _de facto_, were the property\r\nof the United Empire Loyalists on the St. Lawrence in territory which\r\nin 1791 became part of the new Province of Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nThe settlement crept up the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario so as to be\r\nas far as the River Trent by the end of the eighteenth century: and\r\nPrince Edward County had also its quota of settlers. Until the\r\nnineteenth century had set in there were practically no settlers from\r\nthe Trent to near York (Toronto) but that splendid territory of level\r\nclay and loam land covered by magnificent forests of beech and maple\r\ngradually filled in and by the 30's was fairly well settled. In the\r\nlatter territory there were very few, if any, slaves.[15]\r\n\r\nFarther east, however, in what became the Eastern and Midland\r\nDistricts there were many slaves. It is probable that by far the\r\ngreatest number had their habitat in that region. When York became the\r\nprovincial capital (1796-7) slaves were brought to that place by their\r\nmasters. In the Niagara region there were also some slaves, in great\r\npart bought from the Six Nation Indians as some of these in the\r\neastern part of the province were bought from the Mississaguas who\r\nhad a rendezvous on Carleton Island near Kingston. In the Detroit\r\nregion there were many slaves, some of them Panis;[16] and many of\r\nboth kinds, Panis and Negro bought from the Shawanese, Pottawattaimies\r\nand other Western Indians, taken for the most part from the Ohio and\r\nKentucky country. Most of these slaves were west of the river, few\r\nbeing in the Province of Upper Canada _de jure_. Omitting Detroit, the\r\nnumber of slaves in the province at the time of the Act of 1793 was\r\nprobably not far from 500.[17]\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern District, part of which became the District of Johntown\r\nin 1798, there were certainly some slaves. Justus Sherwood one of the\r\nfirst settlers brought a Negro slave Caesar Congo to his location near\r\nPrescott. Caesar was afterwards sold to a half pay officer Captain\r\nBottom settled about six miles above Prescott and after about twenty\r\nyears service was emancipated by his master. Caesar afterwards married\r\na woman of color and lived in Brockville for many years and until his\r\ndeath. Daniel Jones another old settler had a female Negro slave and\r\nthere were a few more slaves in the district.[18]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this part of the province was the home of a Negro\r\nwho at the age of 101 appeared at the Assize Court at Ottawa in 1867\r\nto give evidence. He was born in the Colony of New York in 1766, had\r\nbeen brought to Upper Canada by his master, a United Empire Loyalist,\r\nhad fought through the war of 1812 on the British side, was present at\r\nthe Battles of Chippewa and Lundy's Lane and was wounded at Sackett's\r\nHarbor.[19]\r\n\r\nIn the Midland District at Kingston such leading families as the\r\nCartwrights, Herkimers and Everetts were slave owners. Further west\r\nthe Ruttans, Bogarts, Van Alstynes,[20] Petersons, Allens, Clarks,\r\nBowers, Thompsons, Meyers, Spencers, Perrys, Pruyns, speaking\r\ngenerally all the people of substance had their slaves.[21]\r\n\r\nIt may be noted that there are many records of births, deaths and\r\nmarriages of slaves. In the Register for the Township of\r\nFredericksburg (Third Township) of the Reverend John Langhorn,\r\nAnglican clergyman, we find in 1791, November 13, that he baptized\r\n\"Richard son of Pomps and Nelly a negro living with Mr. Timothy\r\nThompson.[22] On October 6, 1793, \"Richard surnamed Pruyn a negro,\r\nliving with Harmen Pruyn,\" on March 2, 1796, \"Betty, surnamed Levi, a\r\nnegro girl living with Johannes Walden Meyers\" of the Township of\r\nThurlow. On April 22, 1805, \"Francis, son of Violet, a negro woman\r\nliving with Hazelton Spencer[23] Esq. by Francis Green.\" We find that\r\n\"Francis, son of Violet ... by Francis Green as was supposed\" was\r\nburied January 17, 1806.[24]\r\n\r\nIn a paper by the late J. C. Hamilton, a barrister of Toronto, he says\r\nthat Lieutenant Governor Sir Alexander Campbell had favored him with a\r\nnote concerning slaves at Kingston, which concluded \"I had personally\r\nknown two slaves in Canada: one belonging to the Cartwright and the\r\nother to the Forsyth family.[25] When I remember them in their old\r\nage, each had a cottage, surrounded by many comforts on the family\r\nproperty of his master and was the envy of all the old people in the\r\nneighborhood.\"[26]\r\n\r\nYork (Toronto) and its neighborhood were settled later but they\r\nreceived their quota of Negro slaves, at least the town did. In 1880,\r\nthe _Gazette_ at York announces to be sold \"a healthy strong negro\r\nwoman, about thirty years of age; understands cooking, laundry and the\r\ntaking care of poultry. N.B. She can dress ladies' hair. Enquire of\r\nthe Printers, York, Dec. 20, 1800.\"[27]\r\n\r\nThe best people in the capital owned Negroes. Peter Russell who had\r\nbeen administrator of the government of the province and therefore the\r\nhead of the State advertised in the _Gazette and Oracle_ of February\r\n19, 1806:\r\n\r\n\"To be sold: a Black Woman named Peggy, aged forty years and a Black\r\nBoy her son named Jupiter, aged about fifteen years, both of them the\r\nproperty of the Subscriber. The woman is a tolerable cook and\r\nwasherwoman and perfectly understands making soap and candles. The boy\r\nis tall and strong for his age, and has been employed in the country\r\nbusiness but brought up principally as a house servant. The price of\r\nthe woman is one hundred and fifty dollars. For the boy two hundred\r\ndollars payable in three years with interest from the day of sale and\r\nto be secured by bond, &c. But one-fourth less will be taken for ready\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\nPeggy was not a satisfactory slave, she had awkward visions of\r\nfreedom. On September 2, 1803, Russell advertised: \"The subscriber's\r\nblack servant Peggy not having his permission to absent herself from\r\nhis service, the public are hereby cautioned from employing or\r\nharbouring her without the owner's leave. Whoever will do so after\r\nthis notice may expect to be treated as the law directs.\"\r\n\r\nPeggy was not the only slave who was dissatisfied with her lot. On\r\nMarch 1, 1811, William Jarvis, the Secretary of the Province \"informed\r\nthe Court that a negro boy and girl, his slaves, had the evening\r\nbefore been committed to prison for having stolen gold and silver out\r\nof his desk in his dwelling house and escaped from their said master;\r\nand prayed that the Court would order that the said prisoners with one\r\nCoachly a free negro, also committed to prison on suspicion of having\r\nadvised and aided the said boy and girl in eloping with their master's\r\nproperty....\" It was \"ordered that the said negro boy named Henry\r\ncommonly called Prince be recommitted to prison and there safely kept\r\ntill discharged according to law and that the said girl do return to\r\nher said master and Coachly be discharged.\"[29]\r\n\r\nJarvis had slaves when he resided at Niagara. We find in the Register\r\nof St. Mark's Parish there an entry of February 5, 1797, of Moses and\r\nPhoebe, Negro slaves of Mr. \"Sec'y Jarvis.\" Nor is this a unique entry\r\nfor we find this: \"1819 April 4, Cupitson Walker and Margt. Lee (of\r\nColour),\" but these may have been free.\r\n\r\nThere were baptized: \"1793, January 3, Jane a daughter of Martin, Col.\r\nButler's Negro,\" \"1794, September 3, Cloe, a mulatto,\" \"1800, March\r\n29, Peggy a mulatto (_filia populi_),\" \"1807, May 10, John of a negro\r\ngirl (_filius populi_)\" and in the same list was a soldier shot for\r\ndesertion, a soldier who shot himself, \"an unfortunate stranger,\" \"R.\r\nB. Tickel, alas he was starved,\" an Indian child, \"Cutnose Johnson, a\r\nMohawk chief\" and there is recorded the burial of \"Mrs. Waters a negro\r\nwoman,\" September 29, 1802.[30]\r\n\r\nSlaves continued to run away. Colonel Butler in the _Upper Canada\r\nGazette_ of July 4, 1793, advertised a reward of $5 for his \"negro-man\r\nservant named John.\"[31] On August 28, 1802, Mr. Charles Field of\r\nNiagara advertised in the _Herald_: \"All persons are forbidden\r\nharbouring, employing or concealing my Indian Slave Sal, as I am\r\ndetermined to prosecute any offender to the extremity of the law and\r\npersons who may suffer her to remain in or upon their premises for the\r\nspace of half an hour, without my written consent will be taken as\r\noffending and dealt with accordingly.\"[32]\r\n\r\nThere was always a demand for good slaves. For example, in the\r\n_Gazette and Oracle_ of Niagara October 11, 1797, W. & J. Crooks of\r\nWest Niagara \"Wanted to purchase a negro girl of good disposition\": a\r\nlittle later, January 2, 1802 the _Niagara Herald_ advertised for sale\r\n\"a negro man slave, 18 years old, stout and healthy; has had the\r\nSmallpox and is capable of service either in the house or out-doors.\r\nThe terms will be made easy to the purchaser, and cash or new lands\r\nreceived in payment.\" On January 18, 1802, the _Niagara Herald_\r\nproclaimed for sale: \"the negro man and woman, the property of Mrs.\r\nWidow Clement. They have been bred to the business of a farm; will be\r\nsold on highly advantageous terms for cash or lands.\"[33]\r\n\r\nSlavery in Upper Canada continued until the Imperial Act of 1833[34]\r\nbut there does not seem to be any record of sales after 1806. Probably\r\nthe last slaves to become free were two who are mentioned by the late\r\nSir Adam Wilson, Chief Justice successively of the Courts of Common\r\nPleas and Queen's Bench at Toronto. These were \"two young slaves, Hank\r\nand Sukey whom he met at the residence of Mrs. O'Reilly, mother of the\r\nvenerable Miles O'Reilly, Q. C., in Halton County about 1830. They\r\ntook freedom under the Act of 1833 and were perhaps the last slaves in\r\nthe province.\"[35]\r\n\r\nIn the Detroit neighborhood there were undoubtedly many slaves, Panis\r\nand Negro: most of these were lost to the province on the delivery up\r\nof the retained territory in 1796 under the provisions of Jay's\r\nTreaty. But some were on the Canadian side and some were brought over\r\nby their masters on the surrender. Colonel Matthew Elliott who settled\r\nin 1784 just below Amherstburg brought many slaves, some sixty it is\r\nsaid. The remains of slave quarters are still in existence on the\r\nplace. Jacques Duperon Baby the well-known fur-trader had at least\r\nthirty.\r\n\r\nAntoine Louis Descompte dit Labadie, who raised a family of\r\nthirty-three children was the owner of slaves also. He was a wealthy\r\nfarmer of the Township of Sandwich (now Walkerville) and died in 1806,\r\naged 62. On May 26, 1806, he made at Sandwich his will by which he\r\nmade the following bequest: \"I also give and bequeath to my wife the\r\nuse or service of two slaves that she may select, as long as she\r\ncontinues to be my widow.\" After a number of bequests there follows:\r\n\"I will that all my personal property not here above bequeathed as\r\nwell as my slaves with the exception of the two left to my wife, be\r\nportioned out or sold, and that the proceeds arising therefrom be\r\nequally divided between my said wife and the nine children[36] born\r\nout of my marriage with her.\"\r\n\r\nSome of these slaves were probably Panis. There is extant a parchment\r\nreceipt dated at Detroit, October 10, 1775, which reads:\r\n\r\n     \"Je certifie avoir vendu et livre au Sieur Labadie, une esclave\r\n     Paniese[37] nommee Mannon pour et en consideration de la quantite\r\n     de quatre-vingt minots[38] de Ble de froment qu'il doit me payer\r\n     a mesure qu'il aura au printemps prochain, donne sous ma main au\r\n     Detroit ce dixieme jour d'Octobre, 1775.\r\n\r\n     Temoin                     (Signe) James Sterling[39]\r\n     (Signe) John Porteous.\r\n\r\nSome of the reports of judges who presided over criminal assizes,\r\nmoreover, contain references to slavery. Mr. Justice Powell tried a\r\nNegro, Jack York, with a jury at Sandwich for burglary in 1800. He was\r\nfound guilty and in accordance with the law at that time, was\r\nsentenced to death. Powell respited the prisoner that the pleasure of\r\nthe Lieutenant Governor might be known. The Lieutenant-Governor at\r\nthat time was General Peter Hunter a rigid disciplinarian. Hunter\r\nwrote Powell that as York had been convicted of \"the most atrocious\r\noffence without any circumstances of doubt or alleviation\" he was to\r\nbe hanged. When York was made aware of his fate, he promptly escaped\r\nfrom the ramshackle gaol at Sandwich.\r\n\r\nIn the proceedings Captain McKee informed the judge that the main\r\nwitness had \"been an Indian prisoner redeemed by his father and had\r\nlived in his kitchen and he did not think her credit good.\" She was\r\none of Mr. James Girty's three Negroes and \"known to be saucy.\"[40]\r\n\r\nAnother report nearly a score of years later may be of interest. It\r\ncan be best understood in its historical setting. During the war of\r\n1812, as soon as the American invasion of Canada began, prices of all\r\ncommodities began to soar.[41] There was a great demand for beef for\r\nthe troops regular and militia and the commissariat was not too\r\nscrupulously particular to inquire the source whence it might come.\r\nThe result was that a crime which had been almost unknown suddenly\r\nincreased to alarmingly large proportions. Cattle roaming in the woods\r\nwere killed and the meat sold to the army. Prosecutions were\r\ninstituted in many cases. It was found that the perpetrators were\r\ngenerally, but by no means always, landless men, not infrequently\r\nrefugee slaves, who had come to the province from the United States.\r\nThe offence was punishable with death:[42] and convictions were not\r\nhard to obtain. But the punishment of death was not in practice\r\nactually inflicted.\r\n\r\nWhatever the cause, the crime continued until normal conditions were\r\nreestablished when it became as rare as it had been before the war. At\r\nthe Fall Assizes, 1819, at York before Mr. Justice Campbell and a\r\njury, a man of color, Philip Turner, was convicted of stealing and\r\nkilling a heifer and sentenced to death: Mr. Justice Powell who had\r\nbeen in the Commission of Oyer and Terminer with Campbell reported to\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor[43] that there had as yet been no execution\r\nfor this offence in the province and recommended that the sentence\r\nshould be committed to banishment for life from His Majesty's\r\ndominions.[44] Tradition has it that Turner was a refugee from the\r\nUnited States and begged to be hanged rather than sent back where he\r\nwould be again enslaved.[45]\r\n\r\nWhen the fugitive slave reached the soil of Upper Canada he became and\r\nwas free with all the rights and privileges of any other freeman: but\r\nsometimes the former condition of servitude had unhappy results. One\r\ncase will suffice. John Harris was a slave in Virginia. He rented a\r\nhouse in Richmond and lived in it with his wife Sarah Holloway. Harris\r\nwas a painter and gave the greater part of his earnings to his master.\r\nThe wife earned money by washing and gave to her mistress part of her\r\nscanty earnings. The wife's second name was that of her master Major\r\nHalloway in whose house she had been married in 1825 to Harris by the\r\nReverend Richard Vaughan, a Baptist minister, a free man. The couple\r\nhad three children.\r\n\r\nIn 1833 Harris effected his escape to Upper Canada and came to Toronto\r\n(then York) in the spring of 1834 under the name of George Johnstone.\r\nIn 1847 he obtained from John Beverley Robinson, Chief Justice of\r\nUpper Canada a deed of three acres of land part of Lot 12 in the First\r\nConcession from the bay east of the river Don in the Township of York.\r\nHe died without a will in February, 1851. The deserted wife after his\r\nescape married a man by the name of Brown. She continued a slave\r\nuntil the fall of Richmond and died in 1869 or 1870.[46]\r\n\r\nAbout that time the eldest son came to Canada, and he brought an\r\naction as the heir-at-law against one Cooper, the person in\r\npossession. All the facts were clear and the only difficulty in the\r\nway was as to the validity of the marriage of the Negro. Chief Justice\r\nWilliam Buell Richards, of the Court of Queen's Bench tried the case\r\nat the Fall Assizes, 1870, at Toronto. Evidence was given by a\r\nVirginia lawyer and judge[47] that there was no law in Virginia either\r\nauthorizing or forbidding the marriage of slaves because \"slaves were\r\nproperty and not persons for marital purposes.... In short, by the law\r\nof Virginia, slaves were but property, treated as property\r\nexclusively, except where by special Statute they were made persons.\"\r\n\r\nOn this evidence, therefore, the Chief Justice dismissed the action.\r\nThe plaintiff appealed to the full Court of Queen's Bench urging that\r\nthe slaves had done all they could to make their marriage legal. In\r\nvain, they were not British subjects and the rules of international\r\nlaw were too rigid to allow of the court holding the marriage legal.\r\nMr. Justice Wilson in giving the judgment of the Court said:[48]\r\n\r\n\"This is, no doubt, an unfortunate conclusion, for the plaintiff is\r\nundoubtedly the child of John Harris and Sarah who were made man and\r\nwife in form and by all the usual solemnities of real matrimony. The\r\nparents were of mature age, of sound sense, reason and understanding.\r\nThe father had a trade which he followed by permission of his master\r\nfor a yearly sum which he paid to him for the privilege, or as it is\r\nsaid 'he hired his own time.' He rented a house for himself; he was\r\nmarried with the consent of those who could give it by a minister in\r\norders and in form at least under the sanction of religion: he lived\r\nwith the woman he had taken as his wife and had children by her and\r\nleft her only to gain his freedom; yet it is manifest by the force of\r\npositive human law, there was no marriage and no legitimate\r\nissue.\"[49]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The Statute is (1792) 32 George III, c. 1 (U.C.).\r\n\r\n[2] Compare the opinion of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States in the celebrated Dred Scott case. 19 Howard, 354,\r\npp. 404, 405.\r\n\r\n[3] See as to this Reginald W.

Butler) attended the\r\nBoard for the purpose of informing them of a violent outrage committed\r\nby one Fromand, an Inhabitant of this Province, residing near Queens\r\nTown, or the West Landing, on the person of Chloe Cooley a Negro girl\r\nin his service, by binding her, and violently and forcibly\r\ntransporting her across the River, and delivering her against her will\r\nto certain persons unknown; to prove the truth of his Allegation he\r\nproduced Wm. Grisley (or Crisley).\r\n\r\n\"William Grisley an Inhabitant near Mississague Point in this Province\r\nsays: that on Wednesday evening last he was at work at Mr. Froemans\r\nnear Queens Town, who in conversation told him, he was going to sell\r\nhis Negro Wench to some persons in the States, that in the Evening he\r\nsaw the said Negro girl, tied with a rope, that afterwards a Boat was\r\nbrought, and the said Frooman with his Brother and one Vanevery,\r\nforced the said Negro Girl into it, that he was desired to come into\r\nthe boat, which he did, but did not assist or was otherwise concerned\r\nin carrying off the said Negro Girl, but that all the others were, and\r\ncarried the Boat across the River; that the said Negro Girl was then\r\ntaken and delivered to a man upon the Bank of the River by Froomand,\r\nthat she screamed violently and made resistance, but was tied in the\r\nsame manner as when the said William Grisley first saw her, and in\r\nthat condition delivered to the man ...

He\r\npractised for a time but unsuccessfully in Jamaica and through the\r\ninfluence of his brother-in-law, Samuel Shepherd, and of Chief Justice\r\nOsgoode was appointed the first Attorney General of Upper Canada. It\r\nis probable, but the existing records do not make it certain, that it\r\nwas he who introduced and had charge in the House of Assembly of the\r\nbill for the abolition of slavery passed in 1793, shortly to be\r\nmentioned. His manuscript diary is still extant, a copy being in the\r\npossession of the writer: One entry reads under date Newark Tuesday\r\nMarch 6 1793 \"John Young from Grand River came with Mr. MacMichael\r\nrespecting his runaway negro. Rec'd 5 Dols.\"\r\n\r\n[7] The statute is (1793) 33 Geo. III, c. 7 (U.C.). The Parliament of\r\nUpper Canada had two houses, the Legislative Council, an upper house,\r\nappointed by the Crown; and the Legislative Assembly, a lower house or\r\nHouse of Commons, as it was sometimes called, elected by the people.\r\nThe Lieutenant Governor gave the royal assent. The bill was introduced\r\nin the Lower House, probably by Attorney General White, as stated in\r\nlast note, and read the first time, June 19. It went to the committee\r\nof the whole June 25, and was the same day reported out. On June 26 it\r\nwas read the third time, passed and sent up for concurrence. The\r\nLegislative Council read it the same day for the first time, went into\r\ncommittee over it the next day, June 28, and July 1, when it was\r\nreported out with amendments, passed and sent down to the Commons July\r\n2. That house promptly concurred and sent the bill back the same day.\r\nSee the official reports: _Ont. Arch. Reports for 1910_ (Toronto,\r\n1911), pp. 25, 26, 27, 28, 32, 33. _Ont. Arch. Rep. for 1909_\r\n(Toronto, 1911), pp. 33, 35, 36, 38, 41, 42.\r\n\r\n[8] _Canadian Archives_, Q. 279, 2, p. 335.\r\n\r\nWhite in his diary says \"To the 21 June, some opposition in the House\r\nnot much\"--under date June 25 when the Bill was in Committee of the\r\nwhole he says \"Debated the Slave Bill hardly: Met much opposition but\r\nlittle argument.\"\r\n\r\n[9] Simcoe was almost certainly the prime mover in the legislation of\r\n1793. When giving the royal assent to the bill he said: \"The Act for\r\nthe gradual abolition of Slavery in this Colony, which it has been\r\nthought expedient to frame, in no respect meets from me a more\r\ncheerful concurrence than in that provision which repeals the power\r\nheretofore held by the Executive Branch of the Constitution and\r\nprecludes it from giving sanction to the importation of slaves, and I\r\ncannot but anticipate with singular pleasure that such persons as may\r\nbe in that unhappy condition which sound policy and humanity unite to\r\ncondemn, added to their own protection from all undue severity by the\r\nlaw of the land may henceforth look forward with certainty to the\r\nemancipation of their offspring.\" See _Ont. Arch. Rep. for 1909_, pp.\r\n42-43.\r\n\r\nI do not understand the allusion to \"protection from undue severity by\r\nthe Law of the land.\" There had been no change in the law, and undue\r\nseverity to slaves was prevented only by public opinion. It is\r\npractically certain that no such bill as that of 1798 would have been\r\npromoted with Simcoe at the head of the government as his sentiments\r\nwere too well known.\r\n\r\nVermont excluded slavery by her Bill of Rights (1777), Pennsylvania\r\nand Massachusetts passed legislation somewhat similar to that of Upper\r\nCanada in 1780; Connecticut and Rhode Island in 1784, New Hampshire by\r\nher Constitution in 1792, Vermont in the same way in 1793; New York\r\nbegan in 1799 and completed the work in 1827, New Jersey 1829.\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa were organized as a\r\nTerritory in 1787 and slavery forbidden by the Ordinance, July 13,\r\n1787, but it was in fact known in part of the Territory for a score of\r\nyears. A few slaves were held in Michigan by tolerance until far into\r\nthe nineteenth century notwithstanding the prohibition of the\r\nfundamental law (_Mich. Hist. Coll._, VII, p. 524). Maine as such\r\nprobably never had slavery, having separated from Massachusetts in\r\n1820 after the Act of 1780; although it would seem that as late as\r\n1833 the Supreme Court of Massachusetts left it open when slavery was\r\nabolished in that State (Commonwealth _v._ Aves, 18 Pick. 193, 209).\r\n(See Cobb's _Slavery_, pp. clxxi, clxxii, 209; Sir Harry H. Johnston's\r\n_The Negro in the New World_, an exceedingly valuable and interesting\r\nwork, but not wholly reliable in minutiae, pp. 355 et seq.)\r\n\r\n[10] Russell became administrator of the Government of Upper Canada,\r\nJuly 21, 1796, and held that position until the arrival of the new\r\nLieutenant-Governor General Peter Hunter, August 16, 1799.\r\n\r\n[11] _Ont. Arch. Rep. for 1909_, pp. 64, 69, 70, 71, 75; _ibid._ for\r\n1910, pp. 67, 68, 69, 70.\r\n\r\nThe bill was introduced in the Lower House by Christopher Robinson,\r\nmember for Addington and Ontario. He was a Virginian Loyalist, who in\r\n1784 emigrated to New Brunswick, and in 1788 to that part of Canada,\r\nlater Lower Canada; and in 1792 to Upper Canada. Accustomed from\r\ninfancy to slavery, he saw no great harm in it--no doubt he saw it in\r\nits best form.\r\n\r\nThe chief opponent of the bill was Robert Isaac Dey Gray, the young\r\nSolicitor General, the son of Major James Gray, a half-pay British\r\nOfficer. He studied law in Canada. He was elected member of the House\r\nof Assembly for Stormont in the election of 1796, and again in 1804.\r\n\r\nThe motion for the three months' hoist in the Upper House was made by\r\nthe Honorable Richard Cartwright seconded by the Honorable Robert\r\nHamilton. These men, who had been partners, generally agreed on public\r\nmeasures and both incurred the enmity of Simcoe. He called Hamilton a\r\nRepublican, then a term of reproach distinctly worse than Pro-German\r\nwould be now, and Cartwright was, if anything, worse. But both were\r\nmen of considerable public spirit and great personal integrity. For\r\nCartwright see _The Life and Letters of Hon. Richard Cartwright_,\r\nToronto, 1876. For Hamilton see Riddell's edition of _La\r\nRochefoucault's Travels in Canada in 1795_ (Toronto, 1817), in _Ont.\r\nArch. Rep. for 1916_; Miss Carnochan's _Queenston in Early Years,\r\nNiagara Hist. Soc. Pub._ No. 25; _Buffalo Hist. Soc. Pub._ Vol. 6, pp.\r\n73-95.\r\n\r\nThere was apparently no division in the Upper House although there\r\nwere five other Councillors in addition to Cartwright and Hamilton in\r\nattendance that session, viz.: McGill, Shaw, Duncan, Baby and Grant;\r\nand the bill passed the committee of the whole.\r\n\r\n[12] Slaves were valuable even in those days. A sale is recorded in\r\nDetroit of a \"certain Negro man Pompey by name\" for L45 New York\r\nCurrency ($112.50) in October, 1794; and the purchaser sold him again\r\nJanuary, 1795, for L50 New York Currency ($125.00). (_Mich. Hist.\r\nColl._, XIV, p. 417.) But it would seem that from 1770 to 1780 the\r\nprice ranged to $300 for a man and $250 for a woman (_Mich. Hist.\r\nColl._, XIV, p. 659). The number of slaves in Detroit is said to have\r\nbeen 85 in 1773 and 179 in 1782 (_Mich. Hist. Coll._, VII, p. 524).\r\n\r\n[13] A number of interesting wills are in the Court of Probate files\r\nat Osgoode Hall, Toronto. One of them deserves special mention, viz.:\r\nthat of Robert I. D. Gray, the first Solicitor General of the\r\nProvince, whose death was decidedly tragic. In this will, dated August\r\n27, 1803, a little more than a year before his death, he releases and\r\nmanumits \"Dorinda my black woman servant ... and all her children from\r\nthe State of Slavery,\" in consequence of her long and faithful\r\nservices to his family. He directs a fund to be formed of L1,200 or\r\n$4,800 the interest to be paid to \"the said Dorinda her heirs and\r\nAssigns for ever.\" To John Davis, Dorinda's son, he gave 200 acres of\r\nland, Lot 17 in the Second Concession of the Township of Whitby and\r\nalso L50 or $200. John, after the death of his master whose body\r\nservant and valet he was, entered the employ of Mr., afterwards Chief,\r\nJustice Powell; but he had the evil habit of drinking too much and\r\nwhen he was drunk he would enlist in the army. Powell got tired of\r\nbegging him off and after a final warning left him with the regiment\r\nin which he had once more enlisted. Davis is said to have been in the\r\nbattle of Waterloo; he certainly crossed the ocean and returned later\r\non to Canada. He survived till 1871, living at Cornwall, Ontario, a\r\nwell-known character--with him, died the last of all those who had\r\nbeen slaves in the old Province of Quebec or the Province of Upper\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nIn the _Canadian Archives, M. 393_, is the copy of a letter, the\r\nproperty of the late Judge Pringle of Cornwall, by Robert I. D. Gray\r\nto his sister Mrs. Valentine dated at Kempton February 16, 1804, and\r\naddressed to her \"at Captain Joseph Anderson's, Cornwall, Eastern\r\nDistrict\": speaking of a trip to Albany, New York, he says:\r\n\r\n\"I saw some of our old friends while in the states, none was I more\r\nhappy to meet than Lavine, Dorin's mother. Just as I was leaving\r\nAlbany I heard from our cousin Mrs. Garret Stadts who is living in\r\nAlbany in obscurity and indigence owing to her husband being a drunken\r\nidle fellow, that Lavine was living in a tavern with a man of the name\r\nof Broomly. I immediately employed a friend of mine, Mr. Ramsay of\r\nAlbany, to negotiate with the man for the purchase of her. He did so\r\nstating that I wished to buy her freedom, in consequence of which the\r\nman readily complied with my wishes, and altho' he declared she was\r\nworth to him L100 (_i.e._, $250) he gave her to me for 50 dollars.\r\nWhen I saw her, she was overjoyed and appeared as happy as any person\r\ncould be, at the idea of seeing her child Dorin, and her children once\r\nmore, with whom if Dorin wishes it, she will willingly spend the\r\nremainder of her days. I could not avoid doing this act, the\r\nopportunity seemed to have been thrown in my way by providence and I\r\ncould not resist it. She is a good servant yet--healthy & strong and\r\namong you, you may find her useful, I have promised her, that she may\r\nwork as much or as little as she pleases while she lives--but from the\r\ncharacter I have of her, idleness is not her pleasure, I could not\r\nbring her with me, she wanted to see some of her children before she\r\nsets out; I have paved the way for her, and some time this month,\r\nForsyth, upon her arrival here will forward her to you....\"\r\n\r\nThen follows a pathetic touch:\r\n\r\n\"I saw old Cato, Lavine's father at Newark, while I was at Col.\r\nOgden's; he is living with Mrs. Governeur--is well taken care of &\r\nblind--poor fellow came to _feel_ me, for he could not _see_, he asked\r\naffectionately after the family.\"\r\n\r\nIn the will of the well-known Colonel John Butler of Butler's Rangers\r\nthere are bequests to his son Andrew of \"a negro woman named Pat\": to\r\nhis grandson John of \"a Negro Boy named George ... until the said\r\nnegro arrives at the years that the Law directs to receive his\r\nfreedom\" and to John's sister Catharine \"a negro girl named Jane\" for\r\na similar time.\r\n\r\n[14] _Michigan Hist. Coll._, XIV, p. 659. But the actual effect of the\r\nOrdinance of 1787, even after 1805 was not absolute. \"As late as 1807\r\nJudge Woodward refused to free a negro man and woman on a writ of\r\nhabeas corpus, holding in effect that as they had been slaves at the\r\ntime of the surrender in 1796, there was something in Jay's Treaty\r\nthat forbade their release.\" _Michigan as a Province, Territory and\r\nState_, 1906, p. 339. \"There is a tradition that even as late as the\r\ncoming of Gen. John T. Mason, as Secretary of the Territory in 1831,\r\nhe brought some domestic slaves with him from Virginia. It is not\r\nimprobable that a few domestic servants continued with their old\r\nMasters down to the time of the adoption of the State Constitution\"\r\n(in 1835) _ibid._, p. 338, note.\r\n\r\nBefore Detroit and its adjoining territory were given up by the\r\nBritish to the Americans under Jay's Treaty, August, 1796, there were\r\nmany instances of slaves escaping from the United States territory to\r\nBritish territory in that neighborhood and vice versa. One instance of\r\nescape from British territory will suffice.\r\n\r\nColonel Alexander McKee, a well-known and very prominent Loyalist of\r\nDetroit, lost a mulatto slave in 1795 and his friend and colleague\r\nCaptain Matthew Elliott sent a man David Tait to look for him in what\r\nis now Indiana. Tait's success or want of success is shown by his\r\naffidavit before George Sharp a justice of the peace for the Western\r\nDistrict of Upper Canada residing in Detroit. The whole deposition\r\nwill be given as it illustrates the terms on which the two peoples\r\nwere living at the time in that country, and shows that even then the\r\ncharges were made which were afterwards made one of the pretexts for\r\nthe War of 1812. It is given in the _Mich. Hist.

VII.\r\n\r\n[15] I have found no reliable accounts of slaves in this region--some\r\ntraditions which I have investigated proved unreliable and illusory.\r\n\r\n[16] I cannot trace many Panis slaves in Upper Canada proper; that\r\nthere were some at Detroit is certain and equally certain that some\r\nwere at one time on both shores of the Niagara River. I do not know of\r\nan account of the numbers of slaves at the time; in Detroit, March 31,\r\n1779, there were 60 male and 78 female slaves in a population of about\r\n2,550 (_Mich. Hist. Coll._, X, p. 326); Nov. 1, 1780, 79 male and 96\r\nfemale slaves in a somewhat smaller population (_Mich. Hist. Coll._,\r\nXIII, p. 53); in 1778, 127 in a population of 2,144 (_Mich. Hist.\r\nColl._, IX, p. 469); 85 in 1773, 179 in 1782 (_Mich. Hist. Coll._,\r\nVII, p. 524); 78 male and 101 female (_Mich. Hist. Coll._, XIII, p.\r\n54). The Ordinance of Congress July 13, 1787, forbidding slavery\r\n\"northwest of the Ohio River\" passed with but one dissenting voice,\r\nthat of a delegate from New York was quite disregarded in Detroit\r\n(_Mich. Hist. Coll._, I, 415); and indeed as has been said, Detroit\r\nand the neighboring country remained British (_de facto_) until\r\nAugust, 1796, and part of Upper Canada from 1791 till that date.\r\n\r\n[17] This is indicated by a number of facts none of much significance\r\nand all together far from conclusive--but it is a mere estimate\r\nperhaps not much more than a guess and I should not be astonished if\r\nit were proved that the estimate was astray by 100 either way. Indeed\r\ncontemporary estimates gave for the Nassau District alone in 1791, 300\r\nNegro slaves and a few Panis. Col. Mathew Elliott in 1784 brought more\r\nthan 50 slaves to his estate at Amherstburg.\r\n\r\n[18] See letter of Sheriff Sherwood, _Papers &c, Ontario Historical\r\nSociety_ 1901, Vol. 3, p. 107. Justus Sherwood came from Vermont,\r\noriginally from Connecticut, joined Burgoyne's army in 1777 and came\r\nto Canada in 1778, joined Rogers' Rangers and served during the war.\r\nHe came to Prescott in 1784. He had had a not unusual experience with\r\nthe Continentals. His \"Negro wench and two negroe children\" had been\r\nseized and \"sold to Wm. Drake.\" (Second _Ont. Arch. Rep._, 1904, p.\r\n820.) Daniel Jones, father of Sir Daniel Jones of Brockville, came\r\nfrom Charlotte County, New York (_ibid._, p. 398). He was also a\r\nnative of Connecticut.\r\n\r\n[19] He was in full possession of all his faculties and had been\r\nbrought to Ottawa to prove the death of one person in 1803 and of\r\nanother in 1814. The action was Morris _v._ Henderson \"Ottawa Citizen\"\r\nMay 3, 1867. Robert I. D. Gray mentioned in note 13 above, came from\r\nthis district.\r\n\r\n[20] A Van Alstyne--Major Peter Van Alstyne--was elected to represent\r\nPrince Edward County in the first Legislative Assembly when Philip\r\nDorland was unseated because he would not take the prescribed oath\r\nbeing a Quaker.\r\n\r\n[21] See the interesting paper read before the Women's Historical\r\nSociety of Toronto by Mrs. W. T. Hallam, B.A., and published in _The\r\nCanadian Churchman_, May 8, 1919, republished in pamphlet form. I am\r\nauthorized by Mrs. Hallam to make full use of her researches and I\r\ntake advantage of this permission. Mrs. Hallam has also the following:\r\n\r\n\"There is an old orchard between Collins Bay and Bath, Ontario, now\r\nused as a garden, which belongs to the Fairfield family. The children\r\nof this Loyalist family brought the seeds in their pockets from the\r\nold home in Vermont, and here lie buried the slaves belonging to the\r\nFairfield and Pruyn families. On the way over they milked the cows,\r\nwhich were brought with them, and sometimes the milk was the only food\r\nwhich they had. The old Fairfield Homestead, built in 1793, is still\r\nstanding, but the negro quarters are unused, for as those who live\r\nthere say, \"On a hot day you would declare the slaves were still\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Alice Fairfield of the White House, Collins Bay, a descendant of\r\nthese Fairfields gives the following account in a paper read before\r\nthe Woman's Historical Society, Toronto (of which Mrs. Seymour Corley\r\nof Toronto has been good enough to furnish me a copy) \"In March 1799,\r\nStephen Fairfield married Maria Pruyn (from Kinder Hook, N. Y.), whose\r\nmarriage portion included several slaves. They remained with the\r\nfamily as a matter of course after the law had given them their\r\nfreedom. Of their devotion a story is told--\"Mott\" the old black nurse\r\nof my great grandmother walked to York (Toronto) a distance of 160\r\nmiles in cold weather to warn her of a plot against her property--the\r\nshoes were literally worn off her feet.\" The writer adds \"The Tory\r\nbranch of the Fairfield family that came to Canada were from Paulet\r\nCounty, Vermont ... they brought some 'niggers' as they called their\r\nblack slaves, into Canada.\" \"The first apples grown in the country\r\nwere raised from the seeds of apples with which the Children had\r\nfilled their pockets at the old home.\"\r\n\r\nA contributor to the _Napanee Banner_ writes: \"There has been\r\nconsiderable controversy of late whether slaves ever were owned in\r\nthis section of Canada. The Allens brought three slaves with them who\r\nremained with the family for years. Thomas Dorland also had a number\r\nof slaves who were members of the house-hold as late as 1820. The\r\nPruyns who lived on the front of Fredericksburg had, we are informed,\r\nover a dozen slaves with them. The Ruttans of Adolphustown brought two\r\nablebodied slaves with them. Major Van Alstyne also had slaves; so had\r\nJohn Huyck who lived north of Hay Bay, and the Bogarts near neighbors,\r\nand the Trampours of the opposite side of Hay Bay. The Clarks of\r\nErnestown, now called Bath, owned slaves who were with them years\r\nafter their residence in Canada. The Everetts of Kingston Township and\r\nthe Cartwrights of Kingston had theirs.\"\r\n\r\n[22] A man of considerable note: in 1800 appointed with Richard\r\nCartwright, Commissioner to settle the finances between the two\r\nProvinces.\r\n\r\n[23] Member for Lenox, Hastings and Northumberland Counties in the\r\nfirst Legislative Assembly: and afterwards Sheriff.\r\n\r\n[24] The Pruyns of Fredericksburg are credited with owning more slaves\r\nthan any other family in that region. Mrs. Hallam, _ut supra_, p. 4.\r\n\r\nThe above extracts are taken from the Registers published by the _Ont.\r\nHist. Soc._, Vol. 1.\r\n\r\n[25] Both prominent families in Kingston.\r\n\r\n[26] _Trans. Can. Inst._, Vol. 1 (1889-1890), p. 106.\r\n\r\n[27] For this and the following incident see that most interesting\r\nbook \"_Toronto of Old_\" by Henry Scadding, D.D., Toronto, 1873, pp.\r\n293, 294, 295.\r\n\r\n[28] Henry Scadding's _Toronto of Old_, p. 296. Dr. Scadding, speaks\r\nof his \"in former times\" gazing at Amy Pompadour with some curiosity.\r\n\r\nMiss Elizabeth Russell, sister of the Administrator, had a slave, a\r\npure Negro Amy Pompadour, whom she gave to Mrs. Denison wife of\r\nCaptain John Denison, an old comrade in arms of her brother's.\r\n\r\n[29] _Ibid._, p. 292. The boy if he had stolen his master's money\r\nwould be guilty of grand larceny, a capital offence at the time and\r\nconsequently not tried at the Quarter Sessions. He was, therefore,\r\nrecommitted to prison to await the Court of Oyer and Terminer and\r\nGeneral Gaol Delivery commonly called the Assizes.\r\n\r\nThe master probably withdrew the charge against the girl and Coachly,\r\nor they may have been so fortunate as that there was no evidence\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n[30] See the lists in the _Ont. Hist. Soc. Papers_ (1901), Vol. 3, pp.\r\n9 sqq.\r\n\r\nIn the list of marriages are found: \"1797, Oct. 12, Cuff Williams and\r\nAnn, Negroes from Mr. C. McNabb\"; \"1800, Dec. 1, Prince Robinson and\r\nPhillis Gibson, Negroes\" and six other marriages down to 1831 between\r\npersons \"of Colour\". These last were probably not slaves.\r\n\r\nThat Joseph Brant \"Thayendinaga,\" the celebrated Indian Chief, had\r\nNegro slaves has been confidently asserted and as confidently denied.\r\nThat there were Negroes in his household seems certain and their\r\n_status_ was inferior. Whether he called them slaves or not, it is\r\nprobable that he had full control of them.\r\n\r\nSee Stones' _Life of Brant_, New York, 1838. He rather boasted of his\r\nslaves. He was attended on his journeys and at table by two of them,\r\nPatton and Simon Gauseville. Hamilton in his _Osgoode Hall_, Toronto,\r\n1904, says (p. 21): \"Thayendinaga lived surrounded with slaves and\r\nretainers in barbarous magnificence at Burlington.\" But that is\r\nrhetoric.\r\n\r\n[31] _Trans. Can. Inst._, Vol. 1 (1889-1890), p. 105.\r\n\r\n[32] Dr. Scadding _ut supra_, p. 295. This is almost the only trace of\r\nPanis slavery in Upper Canada, proper, which I have found. The attempt\r\nto make a crime by the advertiser is not without precedent or\r\nimitation: it was, however, merely a threat and a _brutum fulmen_.\r\n\r\n[33] Dr. Scadding _ut supra_, pp. 294, 295.\r\n\r\nSuch advertisements as these of 1802 indicate an uneasiness as to the\r\nsecurity of the slave property. Dr. Scadding remarks \"Cash and lands\r\nwere plainly beginning to be regarded as less precarious property than\r\nhuman chattels,\" _ibid._, p. 295.\r\n\r\n[34] See _supra_, p.\r\n\r\n[35] _Trans. Can. Inst._, _ut supra_, p. 106.\r\n\r\nThese if actual slaves could not have been very young. If they were\r\nbrought into the province after the Act of 1793 they would become free\r\n_ipso facto_. If born after that Act they would not properly speaking\r\nbe slaves at all but only subject to service until the age of 25.\r\n\r\nIf they were slaves they must have been at least 37 in 1830; but\r\nprobably they were born after 1793 and had not attained the age of 25\r\nin 1833. They might then be young as described by Sir Adam.\r\n\r\n[36] Labadie had been twice married.\r\n\r\n[37] For \"Panise.\"\r\n\r\n[38] The French Minot is 39.36 litres; the Canadian 36.34 litres or\r\n63.94 pints--the bushel is 64 pints--the Canadian minot is\r\nconsequently almost exactly one bushel.\r\n\r\n[39] _Essex Historical Society--Papers and Addresses_, Vol. 1,\r\nWindsor, Ont. (1913), pp. 13, 39, 48-52.\r\n\r\nThis is translated thus: I certify that I have sold and delivered to\r\nMr. Labodie a Panis slave called Manon for and in consideration of 80\r\nminots (practically 80 bushels) of wheat which he is to pay me as he\r\nhas it the coming spring--given under my hand at Detroit this 10th day\r\nof October, 1775.\r\n\r\n  WITNESS:                                      (Signed)\r\n  (Signed) JOHN PORTEOUS.                   JAMES STERLING.\"\r\n\r\n[40] The fact was that Jack York had broken into McKee's dwelling\r\nhouse to commit rape and he had committed rape on the person of Mrs.\r\nRuth Sufflemine (or Stufflemine).\r\n\r\nPowell's report is dated from Mount Dorchester, September 22, 1800.\r\n_Canadian Archives, Sundries U.C. 1792-1800_; Hunter's decision in May\r\nis in _Canadian Archives Letters Hunter to Heads of Departments_, p.\r\n65; York's escape is _ibid._, p. 84; the Death Warrant is referred to\r\nin _Canadian Archives Sundries U.C. 1792-1800_.\r\n\r\nThere were certainly slaves in the Western District. The will of\r\nAntoine Louis Descomps Labadie made May 26, 1806, contains a bequest\r\n\"I also give and bequeath to my wife Charlotte, the use or service of\r\ntwo slaves that she may select as long as she continues to be my\r\nwidow.\" \"A black boy slave to Mrs. Benton, widow of the late Commodore\r\nof the Lakes\" seems to have been as bad as Jack York. Convicted at\r\nKingston of a house robbery, a capital crime he had the \"benefit of\r\nclergy\" that is, set free as a first offence. But he did not mend his\r\nways. He committed burglary and was convicted at Kingston 1795 before\r\nMr. Justice Powell. The judge sentenced him to be hanged but\r\nrecommended a pardon. He said the boy was said to be 17 but looked no\r\nmore than 15 and in view of his education as a slave he hoped that his\r\n\"would not be the first capital example.\" _Can. Arch._, B. 210.\r\n\r\n[41] In a memorial by the judges of the Court of King's Bench to the\r\nLieutenant Governor, January 10, 1814, they point out that prices have\r\ndoubled since the war. The prices before the war and at the time were\r\nof bread 1/ and 2/; of beef 6 d and 1/; of wood 7/6 and 15/.\r\n\r\n[42] Before 1772, this was not a crime at all but only a civil\r\ntrespass; the Waltham Black Act (1722) 9 George I, c. 22 made it a\r\nfelony punishable with death without benefit of clergy. This continued\r\nto be the law in England until the Act (1827) 7, 8 George IV, c. 27\r\n(Imp.), and in Upper Canada until 1841.\r\n\r\n[43] Sir Peregrine Maitland.\r\n\r\n[44] Banishment existed as a punishment in Upper Canada until 1841,\r\nwhen it was finally abolished and succeeded by imprisonment.\r\nBanishment was a very common alternative for hanging. I have counted\r\nas many as four cases at one assize.\r\n\r\n[45] The tradition is a floating and rather indefinite one. It has\r\nsome plausibility but there is nothing which to my mind can be\r\ndignified by the name of proof. The facts of the Turner case will be\r\nfound in a Report by Mr. (afterwards Chief) Justice Powell to Sir\r\nPeregrine Maitland's Secretary Edward McMahon, November 1, 1819,\r\n_Canadian Archives, Sundries, U.C._, 1819.\r\n\r\n[46] _Canadian Archives_, Q. 324, pp. 432, 436 Letter, June 8, 1818,\r\nfrom \"Thos. N. Stewart, Capt. H. P. late Royal Newfoundland Regiment\"\r\nto the Right Honourable Earl Bathurst, dated from Barnstable, North\r\nDevon.\r\n\r\nTurning to a more pleasant subject, while it may not be strictly\r\nwithin the purview of this treatise, it may be permitted to bring to\r\nlight from the files of the Canadian Archives a story of a poor black\r\nwoman who showed true humanity. It may be considered by some at the\r\nexpense of her patriotism. That will not be admitted by everyone, for\r\nwhat share did the Negro have in America in which he lived more than\r\nin Britain which offered him freedom?\r\n\r\nWhen in May, 1813, General Dearborn took Fort George in Upper Canada,\r\none of his prisoners was Captain Thomas N. Stewart of the Royal\r\nNewfoundland Regiment who was wounded. Taken to the United States, he\r\nwas with several other British officers kept for months a close\r\nprisoner at Philadelphia as a hostage under the retaliation system.\r\n\r\n\"At length,\" said he, \"I with fourteen other officers made my escape\r\nfrom the prison at Philadelphia by sawing off the iron bars with the\r\nsprings of watches, but from the active search which was made ten of\r\nmy companions were retaken in the course of three days. I ...\r\nattribute my success (as well as that of two more British officers) in\r\nbeing enabled to elude the vigilance of the enemy to the kindness and\r\nhumanity of a poor black woman to whose protection we committed\r\nourselves in our _real character_ and situation: and notwithstanding a\r\nreward of one hundred dollars was offered for the apprehension of each\r\nofficer without our even being able to reward her in an equal degree,\r\nshe persevered in affording us comfort and accommodation, greatly to\r\nher own risk and loss by the total resignation of her small hut and a\r\ntender of her services to our use visiting us only at night with\r\nprovisions, &c. This she continued to do for eight days. When it was\r\nthought that the active search was in a great degree abated I ventured\r\nby night to leave the abode of this black woman with the intention of\r\ngoing to the Headquarters of the British Army in Canada and this I\r\nultimately succeeded in accomplishing.\"\r\n\r\nHis companions leaving one by one at different times also succeeded in\r\nreturning to the service of their country. Having only $70 and having\r\nto travel 600 miles, Capt. Stewart could give the woman only $20: and\r\nall she received from all the officers was only $50. He wrote Earl\r\nBathurst, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies asking that she\r\nshould be remunerated and saying that he would \"be most happy to give\r\nthe address and the source thro' which communication could be made.\"\r\n\r\nBathurst replied June 13, asking for particulars, and Captain Stewart\r\nJune 18 wrote again on the eighteenth of June saying that the matter\r\nrequired the utmost circumspection and excusing himself from giving\r\ninformation until he had communication with America, hoping to point\r\nout the precise object whom \"His Lordship has thought worthy of\r\nremuneration.\" No doubt the matter then passed into the Secret\r\nService, as no further correspondence is preserved in documents open\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\n[46a] The motion was heard in Trinity Term, 34 Victoriae i.e. in\r\nFebruary, 1871, see the report in 31 Upper Canada Queens Bench\r\nReports, p. 182: Harris _v._ Cooper. The Court was composed of the\r\nChief Justice William Buell Richards, afterward Sir William Buell\r\nRichards, Chief Justice of Canada, Mr. Justice Joseph Curran Morrison,\r\nafterwards a Judge of the Court of Error and Appeal, and Mr. Justice\r\nAdam Wilson, afterwards successively Chief Justice of the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas, and of the Court of Queen's Bench.\r\n\r\n[47] Two years after her first husband's death, that is, in 1853, the\r\nwidow who had then married one Scott sold the lot to Mr. Boomer for\r\n$300. Mr. Boomer sold two acres to Edward Osborne and he to Cooper for\r\n$800. By 1871 the land had appreciated in value so as to make it worth\r\na lawsuit. Of course, the widow never had any right to sell the land,\r\nbut it was at least ungracious for her son to repudiate her deed.\r\n\r\n[48] The law of Virginia as to marriages of slaves even with the\r\nconsent of the master was fully and clearly stated by the Court of\r\nAppeals of Virginia in the case of Scott _v._ Raub (1872) 88 Virginia,\r\n721. See also the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nin the case of Hall _v._ United States, 92 U.

After the Act of 1793,\r\nhowever, a slave by entering Upper Canada became free, whether he was\r\nbrought in by his master or fled from him. Legislation of the United\r\nStates in the same year[1] increased the number of those fleeing to\r\nthe province under this law. Slaves who had effected their escape to\r\nwhat were considered free States were liable to be reclaimed by their\r\nmasters. Shocking instances of the forcing into renewed slavery of the\r\nescaped slave and even of enslaving the free persons of color are on\r\nrecord and there are told worse which never saw the open light of\r\nday.\r\n\r\nEli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin about the same time[2] made\r\nslaves much more valuable and not only checked the movement toward\r\ngradual emancipation but increased the ardor with which the fugitive\r\nwas pursued. From 1793 the influx of fugitive slaves into the province\r\nnever quite ceased. The War of 1812 saw former slaves in the Canadian\r\nmilitia fighting against their former masters and Canada as an asylum\r\nof freedom became known in the South by mysterious but effective\r\nmeans. \"As early as 1815 negroes were reported crossing the Western\r\nReserve to Canada in great numbers and one group of Underground\r\nRailway workers in Southern Ohio is stated to have passed on more than\r\n1000 fugitives before 1817.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed here to give an account of the celebrated\r\nUnderground Railway. It is sufficient to say that it was the cause of\r\nhundreds of slaves reaching the province.[4] Some slaves escaped by\r\ntheir own efforts in what can fairly be called a miraculous way. No\r\nmore dramatic or thrilling tales were ever told than could be told by\r\nsome of these refugees. Some having been brought by their masters near\r\nto the Canadian boundary then clandestinely or by force effected a\r\npassage. Some came from far to the South, guided by the North Star.\r\nMany were assisted by friends more or less secretly. These refugees\r\njoined settlements with other people of color freeborn or freed in\r\nthe western part of the Peninsula, in the counties of Essex and Kent\r\nand elsewhere.[5] Some of them settled in other parts of the province,\r\neither together or more usually sporadically. Toronto received many.\r\nThese were superior to most of their race, for none but those with\r\nmore than ordinary qualities could reach Canada.[6]\r\n\r\nThe masters of runaway slaves did not always remain quiet when their\r\nslaves reached this province. Sometimes they followed them in an\r\nattempt to take them back. There are said to have been a few instances\r\nof actual kidnapping. There were some of attempted kidnapping.\r\nMost of these are merely traditional but at least one is well\r\nauthenticated.[7]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1830, a young man with finely chiselled features, bright hazel\r\neyes, apparently a quadroon or octoroon applied for service at the\r\nhouse of Charles Baby, \"the old Baby mansion in the ... historical\r\ntown of Sandwich\" in Upper Canada on the Detroit River. He said he had\r\nescaped from slavery in Kentucky, had arrived on the previous evening\r\nat Detroit and had crossed the river to Canada as quickly as possible.\r\nHe had been a mason but understood gardening and attending to horses\r\nand had other accomplishments. He was engaged and proved a\r\nsatisfactory servant \"respectful, cleanly, capable, lithe and active\r\nas a panther.\" His former master came from Kentucky and reclaimed him\r\nafter the lapse of six months. The recognition was mutual and\r\nimmediate. The Kentuckian, offered $2000 to Baby for the return of\r\nAndrew his former slave, but the offer was indignantly refused. It\r\nturned out that Andrew had taken his master's favorite horse to assist\r\nhim in his flight but had turned it loose after riding it some\r\ntwenty-five miles. Whether for this reason or for some other, the\r\nKentuckian did not appeal for the extradition of Andrew[8] but\r\ndetermined to use violence.\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards five desperadoes from Detroit attempted to\r\nkidnap Andrew while the family were at Church, but they were\r\nsuccessfully resisted by Andrew and Charles Baby until the service was\r\nover and the people were seen hastening home. The would-be kidnappers\r\nmade their escape across the river. Finding it dangerous to keep\r\nAndrew so near the border, the neighbors took up a subscription and he\r\nwas sent by stage to York (Toronto). This place he reached in safety.\r\n\"He made good\" and lived a respectable and useful life undisturbed by\r\nany fear of Kentucky vengeance.[9]\r\n\r\nThe law as to such attempts was authoritatively stated in 1819 by John\r\nBeverley Robinson, Attorney General of Upper Canada, afterwards Sir\r\nJohn Beverley Robinson, Bart, Chief Justice of Upper Canada. The\r\nopinion will be given in his own words:[10]\r\n\r\n     \"In obedience to Your Excellency's comments I have perused the\r\n     accompanying letter from G. C. Antrobus Esquire, His Majesty's\r\n     charge d'affaires at the Court of Washington and have attentively\r\n     considered the question referred to me by Your Excellency\r\n     thereupon--namely--\"Whether the owners of several Negro Slaves\r\n     who have fled from the United States of America and are now\r\n     resident in this Province can be permitted to come hither and\r\n     obtain possession of their property, and whether restitution of\r\n     such Negroes can be made by the interposition of the government\r\n     of this Province\" and I beg to express most respectfully my\r\n     opinion to your Excellency that the Legislature of this Province\r\n     having adopted the Law of England as the rule of decision in all\r\n     questions relative to property and civil rights, and freedom of\r\n     the person being the most important civil right protected by\r\n     those laws, it follows that whatever may have been the condition\r\n     of these Negroes in the Country to which they formerly belonged,\r\n     here they are free--For the enjoyment of all civil rights\r\n     consequent to a mere residence in the country and among them the\r\n     right to personal freedom as acknowledged and protected by the\r\n     Laws of England in cases similar to that under consideration,\r\n     must notwithstanding any legislative enactment that may be\r\n     thought to affect it, with which I am acquainted, be extended to\r\n     these Negroes as well as to all others under His Majesty's\r\n     Government in this Province. The consequence is that should any\r\n     attempt be made by any person to infringe upon this right in the\r\n     persons of these Negroes, they would most probably call for, and\r\n     could compel the interference of those to whom the administration\r\n     of our Laws is committed and I submit with the greatest deference\r\n     to Your Excellency that it would not be in the power of the\r\n     Executive Government in any manner to restrain or direct the\r\n     Courts or Judges in the exercise of their duty upon such an\r\n     application.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThen came a number of applications for the return of runaway slaves\r\ncloaked under criminal charges, the pretence being made that they had\r\ncommitted some crime and that it was desired to bring them to trial\r\nand punishment. There can be no doubt that in the absence of some\r\nconstitutional provision every country has the right to keep out\r\ncriminals and, if they have entered the country, to hand them over to\r\nthe authorities of the country whence they came; but the rules of\r\ninternational law have never gone so far as to make it obligatory on\r\nany country to send away immigrant criminals even if demanded by their\r\nformer country. It has always been the theory in Upper Canada that the\r\nGovernor had the power independently of statute or treaty to deliver\r\nup alien refugees charged with crimes.[12] This was not wholly\r\nsatisfactory and the legislature took the matter up and passed an act\r\ngoverning such cases, February 13th, 1833,[13] providing for the\r\napprehension of fugitive offenders from foreign countries, and\r\ndelivering them up to justice. This provides that on the requisition\r\nof the executive of any foreign country the governor of the province\r\non the advice of his executive council may deliver up any person in\r\nthe province charged with \"Murder, Forgery, Larceny or other crime\r\nwhich if committed within the province would have been punishable with\r\ndeath, corporal punishment, the pillory, whipping or confinement at\r\nhard labour.\" The person charged might be arrested and detained for\r\ninquiry, but the act was permissive only and the delivery up was at\r\nthe discretion of the Governor-in-Council.\r\n\r\nIt was under this act that the extradition of Thornton Blackburn was\r\nsought but finally refused. The case was this: Two persons of color\r\nnamed Blackburn, a man and his wife, were claimed as slaves on behalf\r\nof some person in the State of Kentucky. They were arrested in Detroit\r\nin 1833 and examined before a magistrate, who, in accordance with the\r\nlaw of the United States, made his certificate and directed them to be\r\ndelivered over as the personal property of the claimant in Kentucky.\r\nThe sheriff took them into custody but when one of them was on the\r\npoint of being removed from the prison to be restored to his owner,\r\nhe was violently rescued and directed across the river into Canada. On\r\nthe day before the rescue of Thornton Blackburn his wife eluded the\r\njailer in disguise and escaped to Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Canadian Government was, therefore, called upon to return\r\nthese prisoners to the United States. Upon examining the record in the\r\ncase, however, the Attorney General of Upper Canada in reply to the\r\nGovernor for information in the case, advised that the so-called\r\noffences of Thornton Blackburn in trying to effect his own escape from\r\npersons seeking to return him to slavery could not be construed as\r\nrioting or rescuing a prisoner from an officer of the law as had been\r\nset forth in the requisition papers from the Michigan authorities and\r\ncertainly could not be applied to Thornton Blackburn's wife who, as\r\nthe evidence showed, had taken no part at all in the rescue.\r\n\r\nThe council[14] was thereafter called upon to consider the question\r\nwhether, if a similar charge had been committed in Canada, the\r\noffenders would be liable to undergo any of the punishments provided\r\nfor in the act passed at the session of the Canadian Legislature in\r\n1833. The Attorney General[15] was of the opinion that had the\r\ngovernment been confined to the official requisition that had\r\naccompanied it, he might have been warranted in delivering up these\r\npersons inasmuch as there was evidence on which, according to the\r\nterms of the Canadian law, a magistrate would have been warranted in\r\napprehending and committing for trial persons charged with riot,\r\nforcible rescue and assault and battery. The Attorney General\r\nbelieved, however, that the Governor and the Council were not confined\r\nto such evidence since, though limited in their authority to enforcing\r\nthe provisions of the act against fugitives from foreign States, on\r\nbeing satisfied that the evidence would warrant the commitment for\r\ntrial, yet in coming to that conclusion, they were bound to hear not\r\nex parte evidence alone but matter explanatory to guide their\r\njudgment; for even with the authority so to do, they were not required\r\nto deliver up any prisoner so charged, if for any reason they deemed\r\nit inexpedient so to do.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the Attorney General, therefore, was that Blackburn\r\nand his wife were not charged with any of the offences enumerated in\r\nthe statute of Canada and that the Governor and Council were not\r\nauthorized by its provisions to send them out of the province. He\r\nsaid, moreover: \"It has not escaped our attention as a peculiar\r\nfeature in this case that two of the persons whom the Government of\r\nthis Province is requested to deliver up are persons recognized by the\r\nGovernment of Michigan as slaves and that it appears upon these\r\ndocuments that if they should be delivered up they would by the laws\r\nof the United States be exposed to be forced into a state of slavery\r\nfrom which they had escaped two years ago when they fled from Kentucky\r\nto Detroit; that if they should be sent to Michigan and upon trial be\r\nconvicted of the riot and punished they would after undergoing their\r\npunishment be subject to be taken by their masters and continued in a\r\nstate of slavery for life, and that, on the other hand, if they should\r\nnever be prosecuted, or if they should be tried and acquitted, this\r\nconsequence would equally follow.\r\n\r\nThe next case was not so happy in its result. It caused much\r\nexcitement at the time and is not yet forgotten. Solomon Mosely or\r\nMoseby, a Negro slave, came to the province across the Niagara River\r\nfrom Buffalo which he had reached after many days travel from\r\nLouisville, Kentucky. His master followed him and charged him with\r\nthe larceny of a horse which the slave took to assist him in his\r\nflight. That he had taken the horse there was no doubt and as little\r\nthat after days of hard riding he had sold it. The Negro was arrested\r\nand placed in the Niagara Gaol. A prima facie case was made out and an\r\norder sent for his extradition.[16]\r\n\r\nThe people of color of the Niagara region made the Mosely case their\r\nown and determined to prevent his delivery up to the American\r\nauthorities to be taken to the land of the free and the home of the\r\nbrave, knowing that there for him to be brave meant torture and death,\r\nand that death alone could set him free. Under the leadership of\r\nHerbert Holmes, a yellow man[17] a teacher and preacher, they lay\r\naround the jail night and day to the number of from two to four\r\nhundred to prevent the prisoner's delivery up. At length the deputy\r\nsheriff with a military guard brought out the unfortunate man shackled\r\nto a wagon from the jail yard, to go to the ferry across the Niagara\r\nRiver. Holmes and a man of color named Green grabbed the lines. Deputy\r\nSheriff McLeod gave the order to fire and charge. One soldier shot\r\nHolmes dead and another bayoneted Green, so that he died almost at\r\nonce. Mosely, who was very athletic leaped from the wagon and made his\r\nescape. He went to Montreal and afterward to England, finally\r\nreturning to Niagara, where he was joined by his wife, who also\r\nescaped from slavery.\r\n\r\nAn inquest was held on the bodies of Holmes and Green. The jury found\r\n\"justifiable homicide\" in the case of Holmes. \"Whether justifiable or\r\nunjustifiable\" there was not sufficient evidence before the jury to\r\ndecide in the case of Green. The verdict in the case of Holmes was the\r\nonly possible verdict on the admitted facts. Holmes was forcibly\r\nresisting an officer of the law in executing a legal order of the\r\nproper authority. In the case of Green the doubt arose from the\r\nuncertainty whether he was bayoneted while resisting the officer or\r\nafter Mosely had made his escape. The evidence was conflicting and the\r\nfact has never been made quite clear. No proceedings were taken\r\nagainst the deputy sheriff; but a score or more of the people of color\r\nwere arrested and placed in prison for a time. The troublous times of\r\nthe Mackenzie Rebellion came on and the men of color were released,\r\nmany of them joining a Negro militia company which took part in\r\nprotecting the border.\r\n\r\nThe affair attracted much attention in the province and opinions\r\ndiffered. While there were exceptions on both sides, it may fairly be\r\nsaid that the conservative and government element reprobated the\r\nconduct of the blacks in the strongest terms, being as little fond of\r\nmob law as of slavery, and that the radicals including the followers\r\nof Mackenzie, looked upon Holmes and Green as martyrs in the cause of\r\nliberty. That Holmes and Green and their followers violated the law\r\nthere is no doubt; but so did Oliver Cromwell, George Washington and\r\nJohn Brown. Every one must decide for himself whether the occasion\r\njustified in the courts of Heaven an act which must needs be condemned\r\nin the courts of earth.[18]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, only when the alleged crime was recent and followed\r\nup promptly that the rigid rule of extraditing slaves accused of crime\r\nwas applied. A case which came before the Executive Council a few days\r\nafter Mosely's is a good illustration of the care taken in such cases.\r\nJesse Happy, a slave in Kentucky, had made his escape to Canada,\r\nstealing a horse with which he outran his pursuers. Knowing the\r\nindisposition of the Canadian authorities to return fugitives from\r\nslavery, the Governor of Kentucky undertook to have this fugitive\r\nextradited on the ground that he was charged with a felony in that\r\ncommonwealth. It appeared that the real object of the application from\r\nKentucky was not so much to bring Happy to trial for the alleged\r\nfelony as to reduce him again to a state of slavery. In the report of\r\nthe Attorney General reference was made to an application for\r\nextradition in a case in which the offence had been recently\r\ncommitted, and because of this fact the requisition was honored. In\r\nthe case of Jesse Happy, however, the alleged offence had been\r\ncommitted four years prior to making an effort to have him extradited.\r\nNo process had been issued in the State of Kentucky nor had any steps\r\nbeen taken to punish him for felony. It was suggested, therefore, that\r\nthe real object of this apprehension was to give him up to his former\r\nowners and to deprive him of the personal liberty secured to him by\r\nthe laws of Canada.\r\n\r\nAs the delivery of the slave under these circumstances would subject\r\nhim to a double penalty, the one of being punished for the crime and\r\nthe other of being returned to a state of slavery even if he should be\r\nacquitted, the Canadian authorities were in a dilemma; for punishment\r\nof the felony was in strict accordance with the statutes of Canada\r\nwhereas the enslavement of the fugitive was in direct opposition to\r\nthe genius of its institutions and the spirit of its laws. Yet as the\r\ncouncil[19] could not take the position that because a man happened to\r\nbe a fugitive slave he should escape the consequences of crime\r\ncommitted in a foreign country to which a free man would be amenable,\r\naction was suspended so as to give the accused time to furnish\r\naffidavits of the facts set forth in the petition on his behalf, and\r\nnot wishing to make of this a precedent without the support of the\r\nhighest authority, the matter was submitted to the Government in\r\nEngland with a request for their views upon this case as a matter of\r\ngeneral policy.[20]\r\n\r\nLord Palmerston having had the matter brought to his attention by Lord\r\nGlenelg, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, recognized its\r\nvery great importance. He accordingly had it submitted to the Law\r\nOfficers of the Crown. The opinion of these officers Sir John\r\nCampbell and Sir Robert Mousey Rolfe appears from a letter from W.T.H.\r\nFox Strangeways, Parliamentary Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\r\naddressed February 25, 1838, to Sir George Gray of the Colonial\r\nDepartment. This officer said:\r\n\r\n\"I have received and laid before Viscount Palmerston your Letter to me\r\nof the 6 December 1837 with its accompanying copy of a Dispatch from\r\nSir Francis Head, in which that officer requests Instructions for his\r\nguidance, in the general case of Fugitive Slaves who, having escaped\r\nto Canada may be demanded from the Canadian Authorities by the\r\nAuthorities of the United States on the plea of their having committed\r\ncrimes in the last mentioned Country and in the particular case of\r\nJesse Happy, who having escaped to Upper Canada more than four years\r\nago, had been demanded from the Lieut. Governor of that Province, upon\r\nthe ground of a charge of Horse Stealing.\r\n\r\n\"These two questions have by direction of Lord Palmerston been\r\nsubmitted to the Law Officers of the Crown, and I am directed by his\r\nLordship to state to you the opinion of these officers for the\r\ninformation of Lord Glenelg.\r\n\r\n\"The Law Officers report upon the general question, that they think\r\nthat no distinction should in the case contemplated, be made between\r\nthe demand for Slaves or for Freemen.\r\n\r\n\"It is the opinion of the Law Officers that in every case in which\r\nthere is such Evidence of criminality as, according to the terms of\r\nthe Canadian Statutes, would warrant the apprehension of the accused\r\nParty, if the alleged offence had been committed in Canada, then on\r\nthe requisition of the Governor of the Foreign State, the accused\r\nParty ought to be delivered up, without reference to the question as\r\nto whether he is or is not a Slave.\r\n\r\n\"The Law Officers desire however that it should be distinctly\r\nunderstood, that the Evidence for this Purpose must be evidence taken\r\nin Canada, upon which (if false) the Parties making it may be indicted\r\nfor Perjury.\r\n\r\n\"The Law Officers remark further on this point that the 3rd Section of\r\nthe Provincial Statute enables the Governor to refuse to deliver up a\r\nParty, whenever special circumstances may render it inexpedient to\r\naccede to the demand made to the Governor on such a point.\r\n\r\n\"The Law Officers, reporting upon the subject of Jesse Happy state\r\nthat they do not think that there was in that case such evidence of\r\ncriminality, as, according to the Laws of the Province of Upper Canada\r\nwould warrant the apprehension of Jesse Happy if the offence charged\r\nhad been committed in U. Canada.\r\n\r\n\"The Law Officers indeed go farther, and say that so far as there is\r\nany evidence of the Facts, what took place was not Horse Stealing\r\naccording to the Laws of Upper Canada, but merely an unauthorized use\r\nof a horse, without any intention of appropriating it.\r\n\r\n\"The Law Officers conclude by, stating, that upon these grounds, they\r\nare of opinion, that Jesse Happy ought to be set at liberty, and that\r\ninstructions to that effect should be sent to the Lieutenant Governor\r\nof Upper Canada.\"[21]\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of May Glenelg wrote to Sir George Arthur who succeeded\r\nBond Head as Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, saying: \"With\r\nreference to my Dispatch to Sir Francis Bond Head of the 4th December\r\nlast No 255, I enclose for your information the copy of a letter from\r\nthe Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs stating the substance\r\nof the opinion given by the Law Officers of the Crown in respect to\r\nthe restitution of Fugitive Slaves who may be demanded from the\r\nGovernment of Upper Canada on the plea of their having committed\r\ncrimes at the places from which they have fled. In conformity with the\r\nopinion of the Law Officers of the Crown I have to desire that Jessie\r\nHappy, the individual with respect to whom this question was raised\r\nshall be forthwith set at liberty.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to see that the very stringent rules laid down by\r\nthe Law Officers of the Crown at Westminster were intended to be in\r\n_favorem libertatis_. Happy was released November 14th, 1837, and so\r\nfar as appears from the official records no further application was\r\never made for the extradition of a runaway slave until after 1842.\r\nThat year the well-known Ashburton Treaty was concluded[22] between\r\nBritain and the United States. This by Article X provides that \"the\r\nUnited States and Her Britannic Majesty shall, upon mutual\r\nrequisitions ... deliver up to justice all persons ... charged with\r\nmurder, or assault with intent to commit murder, or piracy or arson or\r\nrobbery or forgery or the utterance of forged paper....\" Power was\r\ngiven to judges and other magistrates to issue warrants of arrest, to\r\nhear evidence and if \"the evidence be deemed sufficient ... it shall\r\nbe the duty of the ... judge or magistrate to certify the same to the\r\nproper executive authority that a warrant may issue for the surrender\r\nof such fugitive.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this treaty made two important changes so far as\r\nthe United States was concerned. It made it the duty of the executive\r\nto order extradition in a proper case and took away the discretion. It\r\ngave the courts jurisdiction to determine whether a case was made out\r\nfor extradition.[23] These changes made it more difficult in many\r\ninstances for a refugee to escape; but the courts were astute as ever\r\nin finding reasons against the return of slaves.\r\n\r\nThe case of John Anderson is a well-known one in evidence. He was born\r\na slave in Missouri. As his master was Moses Burton, he was known as\r\nJack Burton. He married a slave woman in Howard County, the property\r\nof one Brown. In 1853, Burton sold him to one McDonald living some\r\nthirty miles away and his new master took him to his plantation. In\r\nSeptember 1853 he was seen near the farm of Brown, when apparently he\r\nwas visiting his wife. A neighbor, Seneca T.P. Diggs, became\r\nsuspicious of him and questioned him. As his answers were not\r\nsatisfactory he ordered his four Negro slaves to seize him, according\r\nto the law in the State of Missouri. The Negro fled, pursued by Diggs\r\nand his slaves. In his attempt to escape the fugitive stabbed Diggs in\r\nthe breast and Diggs died in a few hours. Effecting his escape to this\r\nprovince, he was in 1860 apprehended in Brant County, where he had\r\nbeen living under the name of John Anderson, and three local justices\r\nof the peace committed him under the Ashburton Treaty. A writ of\r\nhabeas corpus was granted by the Court of Queen's Bench at Toronto,\r\nunder which the prisoner was brought before the Court of Michaelmas\r\nTerm of 1860.\r\n\r\nThe motion was heard by the full court.[24] Much of the argument was\r\non the facts and on the law apart from the form of the papers, but\r\nthat was hopeless from the beginning. The law and the facts were too\r\nclear, although Mr. Justice McLean thought the evidence defective. The\r\ncase turned on the form of the information and warrant, a somewhat\r\ntechnical and refined point. The Chief Justice Sir John Beverley\r\nRobinson, and Mr. Justice Burns agreed that the warrant was not\r\nstrictly correct, but that it could be amended. Mr. Justice McLean\r\nthought it could not and should not be amended.\r\n\r\nThe case attracted great attention throughout the province, especially\r\namong the Negro population. On the day on which judgment was to be\r\ndelivered, a large number of people of color with some whites\r\nassembled in front of Osgoode Hall.[25] While the adverse decision was\r\nannounced, there were some mutterings of violence but the counsel for\r\nthe prisoner[26] addressed them seriously and impressively, reminding\r\nthem \"It is the law and we must obey it.\" The melancholy gathering\r\nmelted away one by one in sadness and despair.\r\n\r\nAnderson was recommitted to the Brantford Jail.[27] The case came to\r\nthe knowledge of many in England. It was taken up by the British and\r\nForeign Anti-Slavery Society and many persons of more or less note. An\r\napplication was made to the Court of Queen's Bench of England for a\r\nwrit of habeas corpus, notwithstanding the Upper Canadian decision,\r\nand while Anderson was in jail at Toronto, the court after anxious\r\ndeliberation granted the writ[28] but it became unnecessary owing to\r\nfurther proceedings in Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nIn those days the decision of any Court or of any judge in habeas\r\ncorpus proceedings was not final. An applicant might go from judge to\r\njudge, court to court[29] and the last applied to might grant the\r\nrelief refused by all those previously applied to. A writ of habeas\r\ncorpus was taken out from the other Common Law Court in Upper Canada,\r\nthe Court of Common Pleas. This was argued in Hilary Term, 1861, and\r\nthe court unanimously decided that the warrant of commitment was bad\r\nand that the court could not remand the prisoner to have it\r\namended.[30] The prisoner was discharged. No other attempts were made\r\nto extradite him or any other escaped slave; and Lincoln's\r\nEmancipation Proclamation put an end to any chance of such an attempt\r\nbeing ever repeated.[31]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The first Fugitive Slave Law was passed by the United States in\r\n1793. Three years afterwards occurred an episode, little known and\r\nless commented upon, showing very dearly the views of George\r\nWashington on the subject of fugitive slaves, at least of those slaves\r\nwho were his own.\r\n\r\nA slave girl of his escaped and made her way to Portsmouth, N. H.;\r\nWashington on discovering her place of refuge, wrote concerning her to\r\nJoseph Whipple the Collector at Portsmouth, November 28, 1796. The\r\nletter is still extant. It is of three full pages and was sold in\r\nLondon in 1877 for ten guineas. (_Magazine of American History_, Vol.\r\n1, December, 1877, p. 759.) Charles Sumner had it in his hands when he\r\nmade the speech reported in Charles Sumner's _Works_, Vol. III, p.\r\n177. Washington in the letter described the fugitive and particularly\r\nexpressed the desire of \"her mistress\" Mrs. Washington for her return\r\nto Alexandria. He feared public opinion in New Hampshire for he added.\r\n\r\n\"I do not mean by this request that such violent measure should be\r\nused as would excite a mob or riot which might be the case if she has\r\nadherents; or even uneasy sensations in the minds of well disposed\r\ncitizens. Rather than either of these should happen, I would forego\r\nher services altogether and the example also which is of infinite more\r\nimportance.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words if the slave girl has no friends or \"adherents\" send\r\nher back to slavery--if she has and they would actively oppose her\r\nreturn, let her go--and even if it only be that \"well-disposed\r\ncitizens\" disapprove of her capture and return let her remain free.\r\n\r\n[2] Whitney's first patent was 1784. His rights were firmly\r\nestablished in 1807.\r\n\r\n[3] Landon, _Canada's Part in Freeing the Slave_, Ontario Historical\r\nSociety, Papers, etc. (1919), quoting Birney's _James G.

Siebert's\r\n_Underground Railway_, New York, 1899, and in a number of other works\r\non Slavery. Considerable space is given the subject in most works on\r\nSlavery.\r\n\r\nOne branch of it ran from a point on the Ohio River, through Ohio and\r\nMichigan to Detroit; but there were many divagations, many termini,\r\nmany stations; Oberlin was one of these. See Dr. A.M. Ross, _Memoirs\r\nof a Reformer_, Toronto, 1893, and _Mich. Hist. Coll._, XVII, p. 248.\r\n\r\n[5] The Buxton Mission in the County of Kent is well known. The\r\nWilberforce Colony in the County of Middlesex was founded by free\r\nNegroes but they had in mind to furnish homes for future refugees.

But the crime was perfectly proved and the Council\r\nfollowed the judicial opinion in the Thornton Blackburn case that as\r\nthe black had been shown to have committed an offence clearly coming\r\nwithin the statute of 1833, they could not advise a course to be taken\r\n\"different from that which should be pursued with respect to free\r\nwhite persons under the same circumstances.\" They, therefore, advised\r\nan order for extradition.\r\n\r\n[17] To his people he seems to have been known as \"Hubbard Holmes\" he\r\nis always called a \"yellow man,\" whether mulatto, quadroon, octoroon\r\nor other does not appear.\r\n\r\n[18] The contemporary accounts of this transaction, _e.g._, in the\r\n_Christian Guardian_ of Toronto, and the _Niagara Chronicle_, are not\r\nwholly consistent.

Very early trouble was\r\nexperienced by Canadian owners of slaves from their running away to\r\nthe United States. The following letter tells its own story. D.M.\r\nErskine the British representative writing from New York, May 26,\r\n1807, to Francis Gore, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, says:\r\n\r\n\"I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the\r\n24th ult enclosing a Memorial presented to you by the Proprietors of\r\nSlaves in the Western District of the Province of Upper Canada.\r\n\r\n\"I regret equally with yourself the Inconvenience which His Majesty's\r\nsubjects in Upper Canada experience from the Desertion of their slaves\r\ninto the Territory of the United States, and of Persons bound to them\r\nfor a term of years, as also of his Majesty's soldiers and sailors;\r\nbut I fear no Representation to the Government of the United States\r\nwill at present avail in checking the evils complained of, as I have\r\nfrequently of late had occasion to apply to them for the Surrender of\r\nvarious Deserters under different circumstances and always without\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n\"The answer that has been usually given, has been, 'That the Treaty\r\nbetween Great Britain & the United States which alone gave them the\r\nPower to surrender Deserters having expired, it was impossible for\r\nthem to exercise such an authority without the Sanction of the Laws.'\r\n\r\n\"I will however forward to His Majesty's Minister for Foreign Affairs\r\nthe Memorial above mentioned in the Hope that some arrangements may be\r\nentered into to obviate in future the great Losses which are therein\r\ndescribed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Life and Adventures of Wilson Benson, written by himself_\r\n(Toronto, 1876), is found the following, pp. 34-36:\r\n\r\n\"In 1849 I shipped on the schooner Rose of Milton, Capt. Hamilton,\r\ncruising on Lakes Ontario and Erie. In one trip to the town of Erie,\r\nPennsylvania, for a cargo of coal, while lying at the dock, a\r\ndiminutive negro man, with a white beard, came on board the vessel,\r\nand inquiried of me if this was a British vessel. On being informed\r\nthat it was, he desired to be secreted, stating that he was a runaway\r\nslave, and that his pursuers were on his track. I at once secreted him\r\nin a closet which served as a store-room for vegetables, &c., and as\r\nwe were almost ready to set sail, I did not discover his presence to\r\neither Captain or crew until we were some distance out on the lake.\r\nWhen he appeared, Capt. Hamilton inquired of me where I had obtained\r\n'that child,' and on being informed, expressed some anxiety, as we\r\nwere liable to be captured had we been followed by a steamer. As it\r\nwas, he merely looked up at the rigging, and exclaimed, 'Blow,\r\nbreezes, blow!' The negro, who knew no other name than 'Sambo' we\r\nbrought to Toronto. On one occasion, when I offered him some molasses,\r\nhe shook his head and made grimaces expressive of disgust. He informed\r\nme that the slaves employed on the sugar plantations, when beaten by\r\ntheir masters, in order to obtain an indirect revenge, spat in the\r\nsyrup, and committed other filthy things as an imaginary punishment\r\nupon the whites. I frequently saw Sambo in Toronto, and many times he\r\nexpressed thankfulness to me for his deliverance. I may here mention\r\nthat shortly after the arrival of Sambo on board the Rose of Milton at\r\nErie, two suspicious-looking men, dressed in plain clothes, came\r\naboard and paced up and down the deck several times, and as all the\r\ncrew were absent at the time, I felt some apprehenson for the safety\r\nof the poor fugitive; but seeing nothing of a suspicious appearance,\r\nand the almost entire absence of the crew, they sauntered away. I made\r\nseveral other trips up and down the lakes during that summer on the\r\nsame vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSLAVERY IN THE MARITIME PROVINCES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe French population of the territory by the sea, the Acadians, are\r\ndescribed by the poet as:\r\n\r\n    Men whose lives glided on like rivers that water the woodlands,\r\n    Darkened by shadows of earth, but reflecting an image of heaven.\r\n\r\nHistory does not bear out this idyll; but whatever their faults, at\r\nleast the Acadians had the negative virtue of possessing no slaves,[1]\r\nPanis or Negro: nor was it until the coming of the people whose native\r\nair was too pure for a slave that the curse came upon the land.\r\n\r\nThe permanent settlement by the English of Acadia may fairly be\r\nconsidered as beginning when in 1749 Cornwallis founded Halifax.[2]\r\nNegro slaves were among the population of Halifax from the beginning\r\nor very shortly after. Where they came from is uncertain and it has\r\nbeen suggested that they came with the original settlers across the\r\nocean. In the absence of any other explanation more plausible, this\r\nmight be accepted. Lord Mansfield's decision in the Somerset case was\r\na quarter of a century in the future. But it seems more probable that\r\nthey were brought from the English Colonies, and some almost certainly\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nThe official records of the country exhibit much evidence to this\r\neffect. In September, 1751, the _Boston Evening Post_ advertised \"Just\r\narrived from Halifax and to be sold, ten strong hearty, Negro men\r\nmostly tradesman, such as caulkers, carpenters, sailmakers and\r\nropemakers.[3] Any person wishing to purchase may enquire of Benjamin\r\nHalliwell of Boston.\" Such an advertisement indicates that\r\nshipbuilding was slack at Halifax and more brisk at Boston. A\r\nconjecture may be hazarded that these slaves had been taken by their\r\nmaster to Halifax to build ships and then returned to the colony when\r\nrequired no longer in Acadia.\r\n\r\nSome such conjecture receives a little assistance from a will still on\r\nrecord in Halifax. It was made February 28, 1752, by Thomas Thomas\r\n\"late of New York but now of Halifax\" and disposed of his \"goods,\r\nchattels and negros\" including one bequest to this effect: \"all my\r\nplate and my negro servant Orange that now lives with me at Halifax, I\r\nleave and bequeath to my son.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same year, _The Halifax Gazette_ of May 15 contains the\r\nadvertisement \"Just imported and to be sold by Joshua Mauger at Major\r\nLockman's store in Halifax, several Negro slaves as follows: A woman\r\naged 35, two boys aged 12 and 13 respectively, two of 18 and a man\r\naged 30.\" In the _Halifax Gazette_ of Saturday, May 30, 1752, sale is\r\nadvertised thus: \"Just imported and to be sold by Joshua Mauger, at\r\nMajor Lockman's store in Halifax, several negro slaves, viz., a very\r\nlikely negro wench, of about thirty-five years of age, a Creole born,\r\nhas been brought up in a gentleman's family, and capable of doing all\r\nsorts of work belonging thereto, as needle-work of all sorts and in\r\nthe best manner; also washing, ironing, cooking, and every other thing\r\nthat can be expected from such a slave: also two negro boys of about\r\n12 or 13 years old, likely, healthy, and well-shaped, and understand\r\nsome English. Likewise two healthy negro slaves of about 18 years of\r\nage, of agreeable tempers and fit for any kind of business: And also a\r\nhealthy negro man of about 30 years of age.\" In September 1759, a\r\nHalifax merchant, Malachy Salter wrote to his wife then visiting\r\nrelatives in Boston informing her of the state of the family, saying\r\nthat \"Jack is Jack still but rather worse. I am obliged to exercise\r\nthe cat or stick almost every day. I believe Halifax don't afford\r\nanother such idle, deceitful villain\"--\"Pray purchase a Negro boy if\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year of the surrender of Montreal, the _Halifax Gazette_,\r\nNovember 1, 1760, advertised \"To be sold at public auction on Monday\r\nthe 3rd of November, at the house of Mr. John Rider, two slaves, viz.,\r\na boy and a girl, about 11 years old; likewise a puncheon of choice\r\ncherry brandy with sundry other articles.\"\r\n\r\nSome legal sanction, moreover, was given slavery. A General Assembly\r\nthe first Elective Legislature in what is now Canada, met at Halifax\r\nin 1757. In 1762 the second session of the third General Assembly\r\npassed an act[4] which seems not to have received very much attention\r\nfrom legists[5] and writers. It contains a recognition of slavery. The\r\nact provides by section 2 that \"in case any soldier, sailor, servant,\r\napprentice, bound servant or negro slave or any other person\r\nwhatsoever shall leave any pawn or pledge with a vendor of liquor for\r\nthe payment of any sum exceeding five shillings for liquor such\r\nsoldier, sailor, servant, apprentice bound servant or negro slave ...\r\nor the master or mistress of such servant, apprentice, bound servant\r\nor negro slave\" might by proceedings before a Justice of the Peace\r\nobtain an order for the restoration of the pawn or pledge--and the\r\nvendor might be fined 20 shillings \"for the use of the poor.\"[6]\r\n\r\nFor this reason slavery could easily continue as subsequent records\r\nprove. In July, 1767, Charles Proctor of Halifax sold Louisa, a\r\n\"Mulotta\" girl, to Mary Wood of Annapolis for L15 currency[7] and next\r\nyear Mary Wood assigned the girl to her daughter Mrs. Mary Day. In\r\nJune, 1767, James Simonds of the St. John River wrote to Hazen and\r\nJarvis at Newburyport, Massachusetts, a letter in which he complains\r\nof \"that rascal negro, West\" who cannot be got to do a quarter of a\r\nman's work. In an advertisement in a Halifax paper in 1769 are offered\r\nfor sale to the highest bidder \"two hogsheads of rum, three of sugar\r\nand two well-grown negro girls aged 14 and 12.\" Those were clearly a\r\nconsignment from the West Indies. The executors of John Margerum of\r\nHalifax deceased, in their accounts give credit for L29.9.4.1/2 \"net\r\nproceeds of a negro boy sold at Carolina.\" In 1770 the executors of\r\nJoseph Gerrish of Halifax lost L30 on the sale of three Negroes for\r\nL150 to Richard Williams and Abraham Constable, the Negroes having\r\nbeen appraised at L180: and a Negro boy named John Fame was not then\r\nsold. In April 1770, Mrs. Martha Prichard of Halifax, widow,\r\nbequeathed to her daughter, wife of Moses Delesdernier a Negro slave\r\nwoman named Jessie. If Mrs. Delesdernier did not wish to retain the\r\nslave, she was to be sold and the proceeds of the sale given to Mrs.\r\nDelesdernier. If she kept her, the slave at the death of Mrs.\r\nDelesdernier was to be the property of her son Ferdinand. By the same\r\ninstrument the testatrix bequeathed to her grand-daughter a mulatto\r\nslave John Patten two and a half years old.\r\n\r\nBy the census of the year 1771 the Rev. James Lyon, the first\r\nPresbyterian Minister in Nova Scotia, is shown to have owned a colored\r\nboy, the only Negro in the township of Onslow and John Young in the\r\ntownship of Amherst also a Negro boy, the only one in the township. In\r\nAnnapolis, Magdalen Winnett owned a man, woman and girl; Joseph\r\nWinnett owned a woman and a boy; Ebenezer Messenger and Ann Williams\r\neach a man, and John Stork of Granville owned a man the only Negro in\r\nthe township; and Henry Evans of Annapolis had the previous year owned\r\na colored girl.\r\n\r\nJacob Hurd of Halifax offered in 1773 a reward of L5 for the\r\napprehension of his runaway Negro, Cromwell, a \"short thick set strong\r\nfellow,\" strongly pock marked \"especially on the nose\" and wearing a\r\ngreen cloth jacket and a cocked hat. In July 1773, in the _Nova Scotia\r\nGazette and Weekly Chronicle_ the executor and executrix of Joseph\r\nPierpont of Halifax advertised \"a Negro named Prince to be sold at\r\nprivate sale.\" This perhaps indicated a repugnance to offering human\r\nbeings for sale by auction. In the _Nova Scotia Gazette and Weekly\r\nChronicle_, March 27, 1775 is an advertisement for the sale of a\r\n\"likely well-made negro boy about 16 year old.\"\r\n\r\nIn the inventory of the estate of the late John Rock appeared in 1776\r\na Negro woman named Thursday. She was inventoried at L25 but sold for\r\nL20. In this year also a Windsor farmer, Joseph Wilson left by will\r\ntwo Negro women Byna and Sylla to his wife. In January 1779 the _Nova\r\nScotia Gazette and Weekly Chronicle_ advertised for sale an able Negro\r\nwoman, about 21 year old, \"capable of performing both town and country\r\nwork and an exceedingly good cook.\" In the same year Daniel Stratford\r\nof Halifax left to his wife a Negro man slave Adam for life, after her\r\ndeath to become the property of his daughter Sarah Lawson. Matthew\r\nHarris of Picton sold for L50 to Matthew Archibald of Truro, tanner, a\r\n\"Negro boy named Abram, about 12 years of age\" born of Harris' Negro\r\nslave in Harris' house in Maryland.\r\n\r\nIn 1780 rewards were offered, one of 3 guineas, for the apprehension\r\nand delivery at the office of the Commanding Officer of Engineers at\r\nHalifax of two runaway Negro men; another \"a handsome reward to be\r\npaid for securing in any gaol a Negro boy Mungo about 14 years old and\r\nwell built\"--the owner Benjamin De Wolfe of Windsor to be notified.\r\nThat year the executors of Colonel Henry Denny Denson of West\r\nFalmouth debit themselves with L75 received for \"Spruce,\" L60 for\r\n\"John\" and L30 for \"Juba\" and credit themselves with L2.11.6 paid for\r\ntaking two of these to Halifax probably for sale there.\r\n\r\nAbel Michener of Falmouth advertised in 1781 a reward of L5 for the\r\ncapture of a Negro named James; and Samuel Mack of Port Medway wanted\r\na Negro named \"Chance\" returned.\r\n\r\nRichard Wenman of Halifax in September of that year agreed to give his\r\nNegro, Cato, his liberty \"if he will faithfully serve my said\r\ndaughter, Elizabeth Susannah Pringle two years.\" Captain Wilson of the\r\ntransport _Friends_ requested in 1782 that masters of vessels will not\r\nship as a seaman his runaway Negro lad Ben, saying: \"He is my own\r\nproperty.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no need for further particularization; for we now come to the\r\nyear of the definitive peace between the mother country and the new\r\nrepublic. As in the upper country so by the sea there was a great\r\ninflux of Loyalists, accompanied in many instances by their slaves.\r\nThereafter sales, advertisements for auctions, rewards for runaway\r\nslaves, bequests of slaves, &c., are very common and there were some\r\nmanumissions. That, however, was not the cause of the great increase\r\nin the Negro population of the Maritime Province. The Island of St.\r\nJohn, afterwards Prince Edward Island had been set off as a separate\r\nprovince in 1769 but the Province of Nova Scotia included what became\r\nthe Province of New Brunswick until 1786.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War, the British commanders, Sir Henry\r\nClinton in particular, had made it a point to invite the slaves to the\r\nBritish line and many had accepted the invitation. No few of these\r\nrefugees were of material service to the British troops in various\r\nways both menial and otherwise. At the peace Washington demanded the\r\nreturn of these quondam slaves.[8] Sir Guy Carleton refused but made\r\na careful inventory of them with full description, name, former\r\nmaster, etc., so that Washington might claim compensation from the\r\nBritish Government, if he saw fit.[9] In addition to these slaves\r\nsomewhere about 3,000 freed Negroes accompanied the British troops on\r\ntheir withdrawal from New York, nearly all coming to Nova Scotia. Many\r\nof these after suffering great hardships were sent to Sierra Leone on\r\nthe West Coast of Africa in 1792. Some remained in the province where\r\ntheir descendants are found until this day; but not in any very great\r\nnumbers. The Loyalists, however, retained their property in their own\r\nslaves; and immigration was encouraged by the Act of 1790.[10]\r\n\r\nThe trade in Negroes was very brisk for some years. For example, on\r\nJune 24, 1783, the _Nova Scotia Gazette and Weekly Chronicle_\r\nadvertised for sale a Negro woman, \"25 years of age, a good house\r\nservant.\" On December 11, 1783, Captain Alexander Campbell late of the\r\nSouth Carolina Loyalists sold to Captain Thomas Green late of the\r\nRoyal Nova Scotia Foot a Negro woman named Nancy for L40. Nancy two\r\nyears later was sold by Green to Abraham Forst of Halifax and a year\r\nlater still with her child Tom to Gregory Townsend.\r\n\r\nA shipment was made by John Wentworth from Halifax to Surinam, Dutch\r\nGuiana, of nineteen Negro slaves, \"all American born or well seasoned\r\n... perfectly stout, healthy, sober, orderly, industrious and\r\nobedient.\" These, said he, \"I have had christened and would rather\r\nhave liberated them than send them to any estate that I am not sure of\r\ntheir being treated with care and humanity which I shall consider as\r\nthe only favour that can be done to me on this occasion\" by his\r\ncorrespondent.[11]\r\n\r\nOn October 29, 1787, John Rapalje, a Royalist, sent from Brookligne\r\n(Brookland or Brooklyn Ferry) to George Leonard by desire of his (R's)\r\nfather a Negro woman named Eve about 35 years and her child named Suke\r\nabout 15 to sell as he himself cannot go to Nova Scotia. Eve was one\r\nof the best servants \"perfectly sober, honest\" and the only fault she\r\nhad was her near sight.\r\n\r\nThe records show occasional manumission also. In 1784 the inventory of\r\nthe estate of John Porter late of Cornwallis, a Negro man is valued at\r\nL80. That same year Charles Montague of Halifax says: \"I have only one\r\nNegro, named Francis; he is to have his freedom.\" In May 1787,\r\nMargaret Murray, widow of Halifax by her will manumitted her two\r\nNegro women Marianne and Flora; and (when he was 21) her Negro boy\r\nBrutus. From the records of a trial at Shelburne, in a magistrate's\r\ncourt in 1788 it appears that one Jesse Gray of Argyle had sold a\r\nNegro woman for 100 bushels of potatoes. At a trial the ownership by\r\nGray was proved and the sale confirmed.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the times of a Chief Justice whose heart was set on\r\ndestroying slavery in the province of Nova Scotia, therein wholly\r\ndiffering from the Chief Justice of New Brunswick, George Duncan\r\nLudlow, who had received his appointment on the separation of that\r\nprovince in 1784. The forward-looking jurist was Thomas Andrew Strange\r\nwho became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1791.[12] The same\r\nimpulse for liberty which about this time was noted in the upper\r\ncountry manifested itself from time to time by the sea. Slaves ran\r\naway from their masters; the masters pursued and imprisoned them. Some\r\nblacks claimed freedom without fleeing. When a writ of habeas corpus\r\ncame up in the Supreme Court, Chief Justice Strange did his best to\r\navoid giving a decision. He knew that slavery was lawful but he knew\r\nit was detestable and he pursued a course which did not require him to\r\nstultify himself but which would nevertheless confer substantial\r\nbenefits upon the black claiming liberty.\r\n\r\nHe endeavored in every case to bring the parties to an agreement to\r\nsign articles whereby the master would have the services of the Negro\r\nfor a stated time, after the expiration of which the Negro received\r\nhis freedom. When the master refused this, as sometimes there was a\r\nrefusal, the Chief Justice required the matter to be tried by a jury,\r\nwhich usually found for the Negro.[13]\r\n\r\nThe practice adopted was like the practice in cases of alleged\r\nvillenage in England. It was recognized that slavery might exist in\r\nNova Scotia, but it was made as difficult as possible for the master\r\nto succeed on the facts. Except the act already mentioned there was no\r\nstatute recognizing slavery and an attempt in 1787 to incorporate such\r\na recognition in the statute law failed of success by a large\r\nmajority. The existing act, too, was given what seems a very forced\r\nand unnatural interpretation so as to emasculate it of any authority\r\nin that regard.\r\n\r\nSalter Sampson Blowers, the Attorney General, fully agreed with the\r\nChief Justice's plan. On one occasion he threatened to prosecute a\r\nperson for sending a Negro out of the province against his will.[14]\r\nThe Negro managed to get back and the master acknowledged his right,\r\nso that no proceedings were necessary. After a number of verdicts for\r\nthe alleged slaves, masters were generally very willing to enter into\r\narticles whereby the slave after serving faithfully for a fixed number\r\nof years was given his freedom.\r\n\r\nAfter Blowers became Chief Justice, 1797,[15] he continued Chief\r\nJustice Strange's practice with marked results. In one case of which\r\nhe tells where he had discharged a black woman from the Annapolis gaol\r\non habeas corpus and an action had been brought, the plaintiff proved\r\nthat he had bought her in New York; but the Chief Justice held that he\r\nhad not proved the right of the seller so to dispose of her and\r\ndirected the jury to find for the defendant which they promptly did.\r\n\r\nSlavery continued, however. Almost every year we find records of\r\nsales, advertisements for runaway slaves, bequests of slaves, &c, till\r\nalmost the end of the first decade of the 19th century, the latest\r\nknown bill of sale is dated March 21, 1807 and transfers a \"Negro\r\nWoman named Nelly of the age of twenty five or thereabout.\" It was,\r\nhowever, decadent and from about the beginning of the 19th century was\r\nquite as much to the advantage of the Negro in many cases as that of\r\nthe master.\r\n\r\nA final effort to legalize slavery in Nova Scotia was made in 1808.\r\nMr. Warwick, member for Digby Township, presented a petition from John\r\nTaylor and other slave owners setting up that the doubts entertained\r\nby the courts rendered their property useless and that the slaves were\r\ndeserting and defying their masters. They asked for an act securing\r\nthem their property or indemnifying them for their loss. Thomas\r\nRitchie member for Annapolis introduced a bill to regulate Negro\r\nservants within the province. The bill passed its second reading\r\nJanuary 11, 1808, but failed to become law; and the attempt was never\r\nrenewed.\r\n\r\nNew Brunswick was separated from Nova Scotia in 1784. The Chief\r\nJustice of that province was not as averse from slavery as his brother\r\nof Nova Scotia. One of the most interesting and celebrated cases came\r\nbefore the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in Hilary Term, February\r\n1800. Captain Stair Agnew who had been an officer in the Queen's\r\nRangers settled opposite Fredericton. He was a man much thought of as\r\nis shown by his being chosen for thirty years to represent York County\r\nin the Legislature. He owned a slave Nancy Morton[16] who claimed her\r\nfreedom and whom apparently he had put in charge of one Caleb Jones. A\r\nwrit of habeas corpus was obtained directed to Jones and the matter\r\nwas arranged to be argued before the full court of four judges. For\r\nthe applicant appeared Ward Chipman[17] and Samuel Denny Street for\r\nthe master, Jonathan Bliss, Attorney General of the province, Thomas\r\nWetmore, John Murray Bliss, Charles J. Peters and Witham Botsford, all\r\nmen of ability and eminence. On the Bench were Chief Justice Ludlow\r\nand Puisne Justices Allen, Upham and Saunders.\r\n\r\nThe addresses of the Attorney-General and Mr. Chipman are extant. The\r\nformer divided his speech into thirty-two heads; the latter took\r\neighty pages of foolscap for his. The arguments were extremely able\r\nand exhaustive,[18] everything in history, morals and decided cases\r\nbeing brought to bear. The case took two full days to argue and after\r\ncareful consideration the court divided equally, the Chief Justice and\r\nMr. Justice Upham affirming the right of the master and Mr. Justice\r\nAllan and Mr. Justice Saunders held for the alleged slave.\r\n\r\nThe return of Jones to the writ was that Nancy \"was at the time of her\r\nbirth and ever since hath been a female Negro slave or servant for\r\nlife born of an African Negro slave and before the removal of the said\r\nCaleb Jones from Mary Land to New Brunswick was and became by purchase\r\nthe lawful and proper Negro slave or servant for life of him the said\r\nCaleb Jones ..., that the said Caleb Jones in the year of our Lord\r\n1785 brought and imported the said ... Nancy his Negro slave or\r\nservant for life into the Province of New Brunswick ... and has always\r\nhitherto held the said ... Nancy as his proper Negro slave or servant\r\nfor life ... or by laws he has good right and authority to\r\ndo....\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice based his opinion on what he called the \"Common Law\r\nof the Colonies\"--and although that expression was ridiculed at the\r\ntime and has been since, there is no difficulty in understanding it.\r\nHe meant custom recognized as law not contained in an express\r\nlegislative enactment. In that sense a modern lawyer will agree that\r\nhe was right. Practically all the English colonies had slavery\r\nthoroughly recognized and often without or before legislation; and all\r\nthe well known legal maxims asserted the cogency of such custom.[20]\r\nMr. Justice Allen considered that no human power could justify\r\nslavery--and his brother Saunders agreed with him. It would seem that\r\nthese judges were concerned with what the law should be, the others\r\nwith what it actually was.[21]\r\n\r\nIn the result the return was held sufficient and the master had his\r\nslave. But the decision of the divided court had its effect. Agnew\r\nreconveyed Nancy to William Bailey from whom he had bought her and she\r\nbound herself to serve for fifteen years, then to receive her\r\nfreedom.[22] The result of this case was that while slavery was not\r\nformally abolished, it before many years practically ceased to\r\nexist.[23]\r\n\r\nPrince Edward Island was called Isle St. Jean until 1798. In this\r\nisland slavery had the same history as in the other maritime\r\nprovinces. Shortly after the peace Negro slaves were brought into the\r\nIsland by their United Empire Loyalist masters. As late as 1802 we\r\nfind recorded the sale of \"a Mulatto boy three years old called Simon\"\r\nfor L20, Halifax currency, then L18 sterling, and a gift of \"one\r\nMulatto girl about five years of age named Catherine.\" We also find\r\nGovernor Fanning (1786-1804), freeing his two slaves and giving one of\r\nthem, Shepherd, a farm.\r\n\r\nIn Cape Breton which was separate from 1784 to 1820, Negro slaves were\r\nfound as early as the former date: \"Cesar Augustus, a slave and Darius\r\nSnider, black folks, married 4th September 1788,\" \"Diana Bestian a\r\nNegro girl belonging to Abraham Cuyler Esq\" was buried September 15,\r\n1792 and a Negro slave was killed in 1791 by a blow from a spade when\r\ntrying to force his way into a public ball in Sydney.[24] In this\r\nprovince, too, slavery met the same fate.\r\n\r\nThere is now to be mentioned an interesting series of\r\ncircumstances.[25] During the War of 1812-15 the British navy occupied\r\nmany bays and rivers in United States territory and in some cases\r\ntroops were landed where there was a slave population. These forces\r\ncame into possession of many slaves, mostly voluntary fugitives, some\r\nseduced and some taken by violence from their masters. Admiral\r\nCochrane in April 1814 issued a proclamation inviting all those who\r\nmight be disposed to emigrate from the United States for the purpose\r\nof becoming free settlers in some of \"His Majesty's Colonies\" to come\r\nwith their families on board of the British men of war and offering\r\nthem the choice of joining the British forces or being sent as free\r\nsettlers to a British possession. He did not say \"slaves\" but no one\r\ncould mistake the meaning.[26] Negroes came in droves. Some were taken\r\nto the Bahamas and the Bermudas where their descendants are to be\r\nfound until this day; many were taken to Nova Scotia and New\r\nBrunswick.[27]\r\n\r\nWhen the Treaty of Peace was concluded at Ghent, December 24, 1814 the\r\nUnited States did not forget the slaves who had got away from the home\r\nof liberty. Article 1 provided for the delivery up of all places taken\r\nby either party without carrying away any property captured \"or any\r\nslaves or other private property.\" The United States demanded the\r\nrestoration of \"all slaves and other private property which may now be\r\nin possession of the forces of His Britannic Majesty.\" The British\r\nofficers refused to surrender the slaves contending that the real\r\nmeaning of the treaty did not cover the case. At length in 1818 a\r\nconvention was entered into that it should be left to the Emperor of\r\nRussia[28] to decide whether the United States by the true intent of\r\nArticle 1 was entitled to the restitution or full compensation for the\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 the Emperor decided in favor of the United States. Thereupon\r\nthe next year (1824) a mixed commission of two commissioners and two\r\narbitrators determined the average value to be allowed as\r\ncompensation;[29] for slaves taken from Louisiana $580: from Alabama\r\nGeorgia and South Carolina, $390; from Virginia, Maryland and all\r\nother States $280.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners adjourned for the purpose of enabling evidence to be\r\nobtained as to the numbers. Clay submitted to the British Government\r\nthat 3601 slaves had been taken away but was willing for a settlement\r\nto accept the price of 1650. Britain declined, but the commissioners\r\nfailed to agree and finally by diplomacy in 1827 Britain agreed to pay\r\nL250,000 or $1,204,960 in full for slaves and other property. Thus\r\nBritain assured the freedom of more than 3,000 slaves and paid for\r\nthem, a fitting prelude to the great Act of 1833 whereby she freed\r\n800,000 slaves and paid L20,000,000 for the privilege.[30]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] So far at all events as appears from any records that I have seen\r\nit is just possible however that \"La Liberte, le neigre\" mentioned in\r\nde Meulles' Census of Acadia in 1696 was a black slave,\r\nnotwithstanding his name.\r\n\r\n[2] From 1720 on, Annapolis Royal had a fairly firm government and\r\nsettlement but it was not until Halifax was founded that it became\r\ncertain that the country would remain English.\r\n\r\n[3] This and most of the facts, dates, etc., in this chapter are taken\r\nfrom the Rev. Dr. T. Watson Smith's fascinating article _The Slave in\r\nCanada_ in the _Nova Scotia Historical Society's Collections_, Vol. X,\r\nHalifax, 1899.\r\n\r\n[4] (1762) 2 George III, c. 1 (N. S.), _Statutes at Large, Nova\r\nScotia_, Halifax, 1805, p. 77.\r\n\r\n[5] It is referred to in a letter from Ward Chipman to Chief Justice\r\nBlowers to be mentioned later. See post, p.\r\n\r\n[6] This Act was continued in 1784 by (1784) 24 George III, c. 14 (N.\r\nS.). _Statutes at Large, Nova Scotia_, p. 238.\r\n\r\n[7] \"Halifax currency\" was at this time nine-tenths of Sterling L10\r\ncurrency = L9 sterling and the 5/ dollar being 4/6 sterling.\r\n\r\n[8] It will be remembered that in the Treaty of Peace it was agreed by\r\nArticle VII \"His Britanic Majesty shall with all convenient speed and\r\nwithout causing any destruction or carrying away any negroes or other\r\nproperty of the American inhabitants withdraw his armies, garrisons\r\nand fleets from the said United States....\"\r\n\r\nSir Guy Carleton claimed that the Negroes who had taken refuge in the\r\nBritish lines at once lost their status of slavery and became free.\r\nThey were \"not Negroes or other property of the American,\" a rather\r\ntechnical not to say finely drawn distinction but _in favorem\r\nlibertatis_; and in any event Britain would not betray the helpless\r\nwho had put their faith in her.\r\n\r\n[9] Washington did make a claim; but the United States had not carried\r\nout its part of the contract and Britain would not and never did pay.\r\nJones' _Loyalist History of New York_, Vol. 2. p. 256, says that the\r\nnumber of Negroes who found shelter in the British lines was 2000 at\r\nleast; probably this is an underestimate. Hay's _Historical Reading_\r\nat p. 249 gives the number of Negroes who came into Nova Scotia with\r\ntheir Masters at least 3000--and of free Negroes 1522 at Shelburne,\r\n182 at St. John River. 270 at Guysborough, 211 in Annapolis County,\r\nand a smaller number at other places. 1200 were sent to Sierre Leone\r\nin 1792.\r\n\r\n[10] See ante, p. --. The Negro population in 1784 estimated at about\r\n3000 was included in the 28,347 of _Disbanded Troops and Loyalists\r\ncalled New Inhabitants, Can. Arch._, Report for 1885, p. 10. There\r\nwere some free Negroes in various companies of the British forces in\r\none capacity or another.\r\n\r\n[11] The Negroes sent were Abraham, James, Lymas, Cyrus, John, Isaac,\r\nQuako, January, Priscella, Rachel, Venus, Daphne, Ann, Dorothy and\r\nfour children Celia, William, Venus, Eleanora--reserving Matthew and\r\nSusannah at home. All these had been christened, February 11, 1784.\r\n\"Isaac is a thorough good carpenter and master sawyer, perfectly\r\ncapable of overseeing and conducting the rest and strictly honest;\r\nLymas is a rough carpenter and sawyer; Quako is a field negro has met\r\nwith an accident in his arm which will require some indulgence. The\r\nother men are sawyers and John also a good axeman. Abraham has been\r\nused to cattle and to attend in the house, &c. All the men are expert\r\nin boats. The women are stout and able and promise well to increase\r\ntheir numbers. Venus is useful in the hospital, poultry yard, gardens,\r\netc. Upon the whole they are a most useful lot of Negroes.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Wentworth, last Royalist Governor of New Hampshire and afterwards\r\nSir John Wentworth, Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia, doubtless\r\nbelieved himself to be a good man and a good Christian.\r\n\r\nThe story of Eve and Suke _infra_ is told by Archdeacon Raymond, 3 N.\r\nB. Mag., 1899, p. 221.\r\n\r\n[12] He went to England in 1796 (it was said, for a visit) resigned\r\nhis position in Nova Scotia, was Knighted and appointed Recorder of\r\nFort St. George, Bombay, India.\r\n\r\n[13] A collateral ancestor of my own, the Reverend Archibald Riddell,\r\nhad the advantage of a similar proceeding a century before. Being\r\napprehended for taking part in the uprising of the Covenanters in\r\nScotland he was given (or sold) with others to a Scottish Laird who\r\nchartered a vessel and proceeded to take his human chattels to America\r\nfor sale. The plague broke out on the ship, the Laird and his wife\r\ndied of it as did some of the crew. When the ship reached New Jersey,\r\nthere being no master, the \"slaves\" escaped up country. The Laird's\r\nson-in-law and personal representative came to America and claimed\r\nRiddell and others. The governor called a jury to determine whether\r\nthey were slaves and the jury promptly found in their favor. Riddell\r\npreached in New Jersey until the Revolution of 1688 made it safe for\r\nhim to return to Scotland. Juries in such cases are liable to what\r\nBlackstone calls \"pious perjury.\" All this practice was based upon the\r\ncommon law proceedings when a claim was made of villenage. When a\r\nperson claimed to be the lord of a villein who had run away and\r\nremained outside the manor unto which he was regardant, he sued out a\r\nwrit of neif, that is, de nativo habendo. The sheriff took the writ\r\nand if the nativus admitted that he was villein to the lord who\r\nclaimed him, he was delivered by the sheriff to the lord of the manor;\r\nbut if he claimed to be free, the sheriff should not seize him but the\r\nLord was compelled to take out a _Pone_ to have the matter tried\r\nbefore the Court of Common Pleas or the Justices in Eyre, that is, the\r\nassizes. Or the alleged villein might himself sue out a writ of\r\nlibertate probanda: and until trial of the case the lord could not\r\nseize the alleged villein. The curious will find the whole subject\r\ndealt with in Fitzherbert's _Natura Brevium_, pp. 77 sqq.\r\n\r\n[14] This is very much like the Chloe Cooley case in Upper Canada. I\r\ndo not know what form the prosecution could possibly take if the Negro\r\nwas in fact a slave. See Chapter V, note 5 ante.\r\n\r\n[15] It is said that August 1797 was the date of the last public slave\r\nsale at Montreal, that of Emmanuel Allen for L36.\r\n\r\nThe last advertisement for sale by auction of a slave in the Maritime\r\nProvinces seems to be that in _The Royal Gazette and Nova Scotia\r\nAdvertiser_ of September 7, 1790, where William Millet of Halifax\r\noffers for sale by auction September 9 \"A stout likely negro man and\r\nsundry other articles.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1802 the census showed that there were 451 Blacks in Halifax; in\r\n1791 there were 422.\r\n\r\nDr. T. Watson Smith says in a paper \"Slavery in Canada\" republished in\r\n\"Canadian History,\" No. 12, December, 1900, at p. 321.\r\n\r\n\"About 1806, so Judge Marshall has stated, a master and his slave were\r\ntaken before Chief Justice Blowers on a writ of habeas corpus. When\r\nthe case and the question of slavery in general had been pretty well\r\nargued on each side, the Chief Justice decided that slavery had no\r\nlegal place in Nova Scotia.\"\r\n\r\nI have not been able to trace such a decision and cannot think that it\r\nhas been correctly reported. Dr. Smith is wholly justified in his\r\nstatement \"there is good ground for the opinion that this baneful\r\nsystem was never actually abolished in the present Canadian Provinces\r\nuntil the vote of the British Parliament and the signature of King\r\nWilliam IV in 1833 rendered it illegal throughout the British Empire.\"\r\n\r\n[16] J. Allen Jack, Q. C., D. C., L., of St. John, New Brunswick,\r\ngives a full account of this case from which (and similar sources)\r\nmost of the facts are taken. In a paper read before the Royal Society\r\nof Canada May 26, 1898, _Trans. R. S. Can._, 1898, pp. 137 sqq., Dr.\r\nJack conjectures that Nancy Morton is the Negro female slave conveyed\r\nby bill of sale registered in the office of the Register of Deeds, St.\r\nJohn's, N. B. Slaves were treated as realty as regards fieri facias\r\nunder the Act of 1732 (see ante, p. --) and at least \"savoured of the\r\nrealty.\" The bill of sale registered January 31, 1791, was dated\r\nNovember 13, 1778, and was executed by John Johnson of the Township of\r\nBrooklyn in King's County, Long Island, Province of New York. It\r\nconveyed with a covenant to warrant and defend title to Samuel Duffy,\r\nInnkeeper for L40 currency (say $100) \"a certain negro female about\r\nfourteen years of age and goes by the name of Nancy,\" pp. 141, 142.\r\nHowever that may be, Stair Agnew bought Nancy from William Bailey of\r\nthe County of York in the Province of New Brunswick for L40 with full\r\nwarranty of title as a slave.\r\n\r\n[17] He was born in Boston in 1753, the son of John Chipman, a member\r\nof the Bar. Graduating at Harvard, he joined the Boston Bar and\r\npractised in that City until 1776. After the Peace he went to England\r\nand in 1784 sailed for New Brunswick of which he was appointed\r\nSolicitor General. After a quarter of a century of successful practice\r\nhe was appointed 1808 a puisne judge of the Supreme Court. He died in\r\nFebruary, 1826.\r\n\r\nHis services to Nancy Morton were given without fee or hope of reward.\r\n\r\n[18] That of Mr. Chipman is given in _Trans. R. Soc. Can._, 1898, pp.\r\n155-184.\r\n\r\n[19] It will be seen that the return sets up that Jones bought and\r\nowned the slave and the case was argued on that hypothesis, but the\r\nhistorians say that Captain Stair Agnew was the owner. The point is\r\nnot of importance.\r\n\r\n[20] _Mos regit legem, Mos pro lege, Leges moribus servient,\r\nConsuetudo est optimus interpres legum_, custom is the life of the\r\nlaw, custom becomes law, &c., &c. That slavery was necessary and\r\ntherefore legal in the American Colonies was admitted in the Somerset\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n[21] The modern lawyer, in my opinion, would find no difficulty in\r\ncoming to the same conclusion as the Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nMr. Chipman in his interesting correspondence with Chief Justice\r\nBlowers (_Trans. R. Soc. Can._, 1898, pp. 148 sqq.) admits that if his\r\nopponents had hit upon the Nova Scotia Statute of 1762 as revised in\r\n1783 \"the conclusiveness of their reasoning on their principles would\r\nhave been considered as demonstrated.\" He adds: \"In searching your\r\nlaws upon this occasion I found this clause but carefully avoided\r\nmentioning it,\" which raises a curious question in legal ethics.\r\n\r\n[22] The reconveyance to Bailey, a quit claim deed, is witnessed by\r\nGeorge Leonard and Thomas Wetmore and is dated February 22, 1800. The\r\nindenture by which Nancy bound herself for fifteen years is dated\r\nFebruary 23, 1800.\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Jack is right in his conjecture the argument took place when\r\nshe was 36 and she would receive her freedom when she was 51. Agnew\r\nchallenged Judge Allen for some reflection upon him by the Judge; the\r\nchallenge was declined and Agnew then challenged Street who\r\naccepted--and they fought a bloodless duel. Street later in 1821\r\nfought a duel with George Ludlow Wetmore over words which passed on\r\nleaving the Court. Wetmore was struck in the head and died in a few\r\nhours. Street was tried and aquitted. One result of this case was that\r\nMr. Justice Upham freed his slaves. His wife had six inherited from\r\nher father and he himself had some, one a girl born in the East Indies\r\nwhom he had bought from her master in New York, the master of a ship,\r\nafterwards married a soldier in Colonel Allen's regiment.\r\n\r\n[23] What is believed to be the last advertisement for the sale of a\r\nslave in any maritime province is in the New Brunswick _Royal Gazette_\r\nof October 16, 1809 when Daniel Brown offered for sale Nancy a Negro\r\nwoman, guaranteeing a good title. The latest offer of a reward for the\r\napprehension of a runaway slave is said to be in the same paper for\r\nJuly 10, 1816.\r\n\r\n[24] For this act the perpetrator was excluded by his masonic lodge;\r\nbeing brought to trial before the Supreme Court in August 1792 he was\r\n\"honourably acquitted\" and afterwards he was reinstated by his lodge.\r\n\r\n[25] Seldom mentioned and never much boasted of in the United States.\r\n\r\n[26] The word _Camouflage_ may be new. The practice antedated\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\n[27] There is a record of 371 arriving at St. John from Halifax on May\r\n25, 1815, by the _Romulus_, who had taken refuge on board the British\r\nMen of War in the Chesapeake. The Negro settlement at Loch Lomond was\r\nfounded by them.\r\n\r\nAt the Census of 1824, 1421 \"persons of color\" were found in New\r\nBrunswick. The Very Rev. Archdeacon Raymond, an excellent authority,\r\nthinks most of these \"were at one time slaves or the children of\r\nslaves,\" but many were not slaves in New Brunswick.\r\n\r\nThose that were brought by Admiral Cochrane to Halifax became a great\r\nburden to the community. It was proposed in 1815 by the British\r\nGovernment to remove them to a warmer climate, but this scheme does\r\nnot seem to have been carried out. By a census taken in 1816 there was\r\nfound to be 684 in Halifax and elsewhere in Nova Scotia. In the winter\r\nof 1814-15 they had suffered rather severely from small pox and were\r\nvaccinated to prevent its spread. Some were placed on Melville Island.\r\n\r\n[28] Presumably because he had the greatest number of serfs in the\r\nworld and was, therefore, the best judge of slaves.\r\n\r\n[29] Of course, Britain refused to give up a single fugitive. She\r\ncould not betray a trust even of the humblest. She knew that in \"the\r\nland of the free and the home of the brave\" for the Negro returned to\r\nhis master, to be brave was to incur torture and death and death alone\r\ncould make him free.\r\n\r\n[30] The Act (1833) 3, 4 William III, c. 73 (Imp.), passed the House\r\nof Commons August 7 and received the Royal Assent August 28, 1833; and\r\nthere were no slaves in all the British world after August, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curse of Negro slavery affected the whole English speaking world;\r\nand that part of the world where it was commercially profitable\r\nresisted its abolition. The British part of this world does not need\r\nto assert any higher sense of justice and right than had those who\r\nlived in the Northern States; and it may well be that had Negro slave\r\nservice been as profitable in Canada as in the Cotton States, the\r\nheinousness of the sin might not have been more manifest here than\r\nthere. Nevertheless we must not too much minimize the real merit of\r\nthose who sought the destruction of slavery. Slaves did not pay so\r\nwell in Canada as in Georgia, but they _paid_.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the various ways in which slavery was met\r\nand finally destroyed. In Upper Canada, the existing slaves, 1793,\r\nremained slaves but all those born thereafter were free, subject to\r\ncertain conditions of service. There was a statutory recognition of\r\nthe existing status and provision for its destruction in the\r\nafterborn. This continued slavery though it much mitigated its\r\nseverity and secured its downfall in time. But there were slaves in\r\nUpper Canada when the Imperial Act of 1833 came in force. The Act of\r\n1793 was admittedly but a compromise measure; and beneficial as it was\r\nit was a paltering with sin.\r\n\r\nIn Lower Canada, there was no legislation, and slavery was never\r\nformally abolished until the Imperial Act of 1833; but the courts\r\ndecided in effect if not in form that a master had no rights over his\r\nslave, and that is tantamount to saying that where there is no master\r\nthere is no slave. The reasoning in these cases as in the Somerset\r\ncase may not recommend itself to the lawyer but the effect is\r\nundoubtedly, \"Slaves cannot live in Lower Canada.\"\r\n\r\nIn Nova Scotia, there was no decision that slavery did not exist.\r\nIndeed the course of procedure presupposed that it did exist, but the\r\ncourts were astute to find means of making it all but impossible for\r\nthe alleged master to succeed; and slavery disappeared accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn New Brunswick the decision by a divided court was in favor of the\r\nmaster; but juries were of the same calibre and sentiments in New\r\nBrunswick as in Nova Scotia and the same results were to be\r\nanticipated, if Nova Scotian means were used; and the slave owners\r\ngave way.\r\n\r\nIn the old land, judicial decision destroyed slavery on the British\r\ndomain; but conscience and sense of justice and right impelled its\r\ndestruction elsewhere by statute; and the same sense of justice and\r\nright impelled the Parliament of Great Britain to recompense the\r\nowners for their property thus destroyed. If there be any more\r\naltruistic act of any people in any age of the world's history I have\r\nfailed to hear or read of it.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, slavery was abolished as a war measure. Lincoln\r\nhating slavery as he did would never have abolished it, had he not\r\nconsidered it a useful war measure. No compensation was paid, of\r\ncourse.[1] Everywhere slavery was doomed and in one way or another it\r\nhas met a deserved fate.\r\n\r\n                                        WILLIAM RENWICK RIDDELL\r\n\r\n  JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ONTARIO,\r\n      OSGOOD HALL, TORONTO,\r\n          February 5, 1920\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] I had with the late Hon. Warwick Hough of St. Louis, Missouri, who\r\nhad been an officer in the Southern Army, several conversations on the\r\nsubject of slavery. He gave it as his firm conviction that, had the\r\nSouth succeeded in the Civil War, it would shortly have itself\r\nabolished slavery and sought readmission to the Union. His proposition\r\nwas that the power and influence of the planter class was waning,\r\nwhile the manufacturers, merchants and the like were increasing in\r\nnumber and influence and they would have for their own protection\r\nabolished slavery. I have not met a Northerner or a Canadian who\r\nagreed with this view; but a few Southerners have expressed to me\r\ntheir general concurrence with my friend's proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK REVIEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Africa and the Discovery of America._ Volume I. By LEO WIENER,\r\n     Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures at Harvard\r\n     University. Innes & Sons, Philadelphia, Pa., 1920. Pp. i-xix,\r\n     1-290.\r\n\r\nThe present volume is the first of a series in which Professor Wiener\r\nwill show that Arabicised Negroes, chiefly Mandingoes, brought to\r\nAmerica as slaves, profoundly influenced the culture of the Indians,\r\nand were an important, if not always direct factor in establishing the\r\n_modus vivendi_ between the Indians and the Europeans, which made\r\npracticable the colonization of the New World.\r\n\r\nThe book is packed with valuable data, newly discovered, and brought\r\ntogether for the first time. It should be read slowly, and read\r\nthrough at least twice before judgment is passed on it. With the first\r\nreading comes a shock. One learns that the _Journal of the First\r\nVoyage_, and the _First Letter of Columbus_ are literary frauds,\r\nthough containing material which came from Columbus's own pen, and\r\nthat tobacco, manioc, yams, sweet potatoes and peanuts are not gifts\r\nof the Indian to the European. Yet with a more intimate study of the\r\nsubject matter, the conviction increases that the author has built\r\nupon the bed-rock of fact, and that his position is unassailable.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, within the limits of a review, to do more than to\r\nemphasise the most important of his discoveries. In his studies of the\r\n_First Letter_, and of the _Journals_ giving account of the first and\r\nthe second voyages of Columbus, Professor Wiener seeks to determine\r\nhow much testimony they give pertaining to Indian names and things,\r\nafter the elimination of all that is not Indian. The non-Indian\r\nelements are of two sorts; the names of the Islands, and the words for\r\n\"gold,\" etc. Columbus, dominated by the fixed idea, that, sailing\r\nwestward, he would find a short cut to India, China and Japan, began\r\nwith the first sight of land, to be engrossed with the task of\r\nidentifying each newly discovered country with some island or district\r\nof the Far East, named on his maps. He was an ignorant man, though he\r\nknew Ptolemy and Marco Polo by heart, credulous, uncritical, not\r\nconsciously dishonest, but unready to correct false impressions caused\r\nby his ignorance and gullibility. His notes, as may be seen from a\r\nreproduction of a page of his manuscripts (facing p. 38), were in an\r\nexecrable hand. The forger of the _Journal of the First Voyage_ was no\r\npuzzle expert, and made mistakes in deciphering scrawls. Thus, for\r\nexample, the note _Giaua min._, _i.e._, Java minor, was read\r\n_Guanahin_, the same destined to masquerade as _Guanahani_, the Indian\r\nname of the first island sighted on October 12, 1492.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best specimen of such ghost-words in the _Journal_ is the\r\nname _Carib_. This is nothing but Marco Polo's _Cambalu_, the capital\r\nof the Grand Khan, successively misread as Canibal, Caniba, Cariba. So\r\nalso, \"canoe\" is a ghost-word, traced to a misreading of _scaphas_ as\r\n_canoas_ in the manuscript, or the Gothic text of the Latin version of\r\nthe First Letter. It is interesting to learn that _maize_, in the\r\nforms _masa_, _maza_, ultimately from Portuguese _mararoca_, is the\r\nAfrican name for Guinea corn. The transference of the name from Guinea\r\ncorn to Indian corn, \"rests on a misunderstanding of a passage in\r\nPeter Martyr's _First Decade_\" (p. 123).\r\n\r\nThe question arises whether or not there had been a colony of\r\nEuropeans, with African slaves in America, before the arrival of\r\nColumbus.\r\n\r\nFray Ramon Pane, Oviedo, and Las Casas give _conico_ as the Indian\r\nword for \"farm, plantation.\" This is clearly the Mandingo _kunke_\r\n\"farm.\" The Indian word for \"golo,\" according to the Journal entry for\r\nJanuary 13, 1493, is _caona_. It is found also in the name of _Cacique\r\nCaonabo_, called in the _Journal of the Second Voyage_ \"master of\r\nmines,\"--the name being explained in the Libretto as \"lord of the\r\nhouse of gold.\" Now the words for \"gold\" in the Negro languages are\r\nmostly derived from Arabic _din[=a]r_, which, through Hausa _zinaria_,\r\nand Pul _kanyera_, reaches Vei as _kani_. Evidently _canoa_, written\r\nalso _guani_, is nothing but this Vei word. In \"Cacique Caonabo,\" we\r\nhave three Mande words in juxtaposition. _Cacique_ is not far removed\r\nfrom _kuntigi_, Soso _kundzi_, \"chief,\"--_caona_, that is _kani_, is\r\n\"gold,\" and _boi_, from Arabic _beii_, _bai_, is \"house.\" The chance\r\nthat three such words should be identical in the dissimilar languages\r\nof Africa and America, is _nil_. The words are African, though\r\nrepresented as belonging to the spoken language of the New World.\r\nMoreover, Ramon Pane, in the account he wrote for Columbus of the\r\nIndian religion, gives as Indian words, the Mande _toto_, \"frog,\" and\r\nthe Malinke _kobo_, \"bug.\" What is more important, he imputes to the\r\nIndians, a knowledge of the terrible West African itch, or _craworaw_,\r\nwhich he calls by the supposed Indian name _caracaracol_. The critic\r\nfaces a dilemma. Either Ramon Pane lied, or he told the truth. Either\r\nhe fabricated stories of Indians, which he drew from books or\r\nmanuscript relations by Spanish and Portuguese traders, who were\r\nwriting about Negroes in Africa, or there had been in Hispaniola, a\r\npre-Columbian colony of European adventurers, with their African\r\nslaves, who taught the Indians the Negro words for \"farm, gold, frog,\r\nbug, itch,\" etc., and also African folk-lore. No other hypothesis is\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n     {Transcriber's Note: The following paragraphs contain a number of\r\n     characters with diacritical marks which are represented as follows:\r\n                [=a] a-macron\r\n                [=o] o-macron\r\n                [=e] e-macron\r\n                [>e] e-caron\r\n                [>z] z-caron}\r\n\r\nThe documentary and philological history of tobacco smoking and the\r\ncultivation of edible roots, shows additional convincing evidence of\r\nthe influence of Africa on the culture of America in the colonial\r\nperiod. Columbus never saw the Indians smoking tobacco. According to\r\nthe _Journal of the First Voyage_, on October 15, 1492, an Indian\r\nbrought him a ball of earth and certain precious dried leaves. On\r\nNovember 16, two Spaniards reported that the Indians, carrying\r\nfirebrands and leaves, used them to \"take incense.\" In the _Journal of\r\nthe Second Voyage_, Columbus (this part of the Journal is definitely\r\nascribed to him by his son) writes of Indians spreading powder on a\r\ntable, and sniffing it through a forked reed, thereby becoming\r\nintoxicated. Now the first account is suspiciously like a book-story\r\nof Oriental hashish-taking.--the second has no implication of smoking\r\nat all, while the third describes nothing but the process of taking a\r\nsternutatory. Indeed this last account is clearly based on a book\r\naccount, in which there was a play on the Arabic words _tubb[=a]q_\r\n\"styptic\" and _tabaq_ \"table.\" Ramon Pane, when he tells of Indians\r\nsniffing the powder, calls it _caboba_, a mere Italianisation of the\r\nArabic _qasabah_ \"reed,\" transferring the name of the inhaler to the\r\ndrug. Smoking tobacco through a forked reed of the sort described, has\r\nbeen proved by trial, to be impossible. As late as 1535, Oviedo is\r\nunable to tell a straightforward story of Indians smoking tobacco, but\r\nhe adds the significant fact that the Negroes in the West _Indies_\r\nsmoked and cultivated tobacco. Negroes, by the way were first allowed\r\nto come to America in 1501,--two years later, Ovando, the governor of\r\nHispaniola complained that they joined with the Indians to make\r\ntrouble. By 1545, \"smoking had become fairly universal in America\" (p.\r\n127). It cannot be argued that half a century is too short a time for\r\na new vice to become so widespread. Consider the case of banana\r\nculture. Oviedo says that the first bananas were introduced into\r\nAmerica in 1516. Within twenty years, the fruit was universally\r\ncultivated, while the Spanish name _platano_ has survived in a large\r\nnumber of derivatives in the Indian languages.\r\n\r\nAs far as the linguistic history of the tobacco-words in the Indian\r\nlanguages is concerned, it leads back to an eastern origin. In Arabic,\r\n_tubb[=a]q_ means \"styptic.\" Tobacco leaves were used as a styptic by\r\nthe Indians of Brazil in the sixteenth century. The Low Latin\r\nequivalent of the Arabic _tubb[=a]q_ \"styptic,\" is _bitumen_, whence\r\nPortuguese _betume_, and French _betun_, _petun_. \"The French\r\ntraders,\" says Professor Wiener, \"at the end of the sixteenth century,\r\ncarried the word and the Brazilian brand of tobacco to Canada, and\r\n_petun_ became imbedded in several Indian languages. The older Huron\r\nword for \"tobacco\" is derived from the Carib _yuli_, which itself is\r\nfrom a Mandingo word. Thus, while the Carib and Arawak influence is\r\napparent in the direction from Florida, to the Huron country, the\r\nBrazilian influence proceeds up the St. Lawrence. The whole Atlantic\r\ntriangle between these two converging lines was left uninfluenced by\r\nthese two streams, and here, neither Carib nor Brazilian words for\r\n\"tobacco,\" nor the moundbuilders' craft have been found. Here the\r\n\"tobacco\" words proceeded northward from Virginia, where the oldest\r\nform of the words is an abbreviated Span. _tabaco_, or Fr. _tabao_ (p.\r\n191). The Carib _yuli_ \"smoke,\" is found in Carib and Arawak, side by\r\nside with derivatives of Mande _tama_, _tawa_, which are also in the\r\nAlgonkian languages. The fact that the Hurons, apparently the first\r\nIndians to plant tobacco, have no native word for the plant is\r\nsignificant. It shows that the Hurons learned to smoke from the\r\nArawaks or Caribs, then already under Negro influence, and at a time\r\nprior to the introduction of the tobacco-plant into Canada by the\r\nFrench. When we consider, then, that tobacco is native to Africa, that\r\n_tubb[=a]q_ and _petun_ are the ancestors of the Indian names for the\r\nweed, that by 1503, Negroes in large numbers were living in America,\r\ndeserting their masters to join the Indians, that the Negroes in\r\nAmerica smoked and raised tobacco, the conclusion is inescapable that\r\ntobacco smoking was discovered and taught by them to the Indians and\r\nthe Europeans.\r\n\r\n\"The tobacco-pipe in America,\" says Professor Wiener, \"began its\r\ncareer as a Mandingo amulet\" (p. 184). This statement will distress\r\nthe American archaeologists, but the arguments in support of it cannot\r\nbe overcome. A counter-claim of pre-Columbian antiquity for pipes\r\nfound in the mounds cannot be made, since it is so clearly shown that\r\nthe mounds are not prehistoric, but were fortifications erected along\r\nthe lines of communication from Florida to the Huron country, to\r\nprotect the overland trade established in the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn the _Journal of the First Voyage_, we find mention of _ajes_ and\r\n_niames_, as name of edible roots, but the account hopelessly confuses\r\nreports of yams, sweet potatoes and manioc. Neither yams nor sweet\r\npotatoes are native to America, and both bear in America, only African\r\nnames. Oviedo indeed, says distinctly, that the _name_ is \"a foreign\r\nfruit, and not native to these Indies,\"--also, that \"it came with that\r\nevil lot of Negroes, ... of whom there is a greater number than is\r\nnecessary, on account of their rebellions\" (pp. 203-4). Now in Africa\r\nthe yam (Dioscorea), cultivated before the coming of the Europeans, is\r\nknown by names derived from Arabic _arum_ and _gambah_, _e.g._, Ewe\r\n_ad[>e]_, _ad[>z]e_, Mandingo _nyambe_, Malinke _nyeme ku_,--whence\r\nthe supposed Indian names, _aje_, _age_, _niame_, _igname_, used\r\nindiscriminately of any edible roots. The African names of the manioc\r\nhave come from Arabic _'uruq_ \"roots,\" notably in the Congo languages,\r\n_y[=o]ka_, _y[=e]ke_, _edioko_, plural _madioka_, whence, as the plant\r\nwas introduced into America, it was known there as _vuca_, _mandioca_.\r\nAs to sweet potatoes and peanuts, the former were cultivated in Asia\r\nbefore the discovery of America, while the latter, mentioned by Ibn\r\nBatutah as an article of food in Africa, took to the New World, their\r\nAfrican names _mandube_, _goober_ and _pinder_ (compare Mozambique\r\n_manduwe_, Basunde _nguba_, Nyombo _pinda_). Professor Wiener's\r\nconclusion is that manioc culture was taught to the Brazilian Indians\r\nbefore 1492 by Portuguese castaways, who knew of the economic\r\nimportance of the plant in Africa, while the peanut, spreading north\r\nand south from the Antilles, may also have reached America a few years\r\nbefore Columbus.\r\n\r\nThe numerous full-page illustrations are extremely helpful in aiding\r\nthe reader to a clear understanding of difficult points in the\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe book is epoch-making. To all seekers of the truth, the coming of\r\nthe second volume, in which Professor Wiener will deal exhaustively\r\nwith the Negro element in Indian culture, will be an eagerly\r\nanticipated event.\r\n\r\n                                        PHILLIPS BARRY, A.M., S.T.B.\r\n  CAMBRIDGE MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _A Comparative Study of the Bantu and Semi-Bantu Languages._ By\r\n     SIR HARRY H. JOHNSTON, G.C.M.G., K.C.B., D.Sc. (Cambs). Oxford:\r\n     at the Clarendon Press, 1919, pp. 815, 2 sketch maps.\r\n\r\nThe author of this monumental work, in the opinion of the reviewer, is\r\nin himself a composite of many of the capacities, which, combined or\r\nsingly in her subjects have made the greatness of Britain. He has been\r\na great colonial administrator, a distinguished African explorer; he\r\nis a talented artist, and has recently astonished the literary world\r\nby producing what H. G. Wells declares to be one of the best first\r\nnovels he has ever read. The contributions of Sir Harry Johnston to\r\nthe sciences of botany, zoology, and anthropology are truly\r\nprodigious. It is in the last named field that his major interests\r\nhave lain, and a succession of important works have established him as\r\nthe foremost authority upon the ethnology of Africa and upon the\r\nanthropology of the Negro race.\r\n\r\nThis ponderous volume on the Bantu and Semi-Bantu languages is the\r\nfirst part of a work which represents the fruit of many years of study\r\nof multitudinous African languages and dialects. The major portion of\r\nthe book consists of illustrative vocabularies of 366 Bantu and 87\r\nSemi-Bantu languages and dialects with an extensive bibliography. A\r\ncompetent criticism of this portion of the work can be made by no one\r\nbut a philologist with a special knowledge of African languages. The\r\npresent reviewer does not possess these qualifications. Nevertheless\r\nit is obvious to any student of Africa that the publication of this\r\nwork places a mine of useful information at the disposal of the\r\nlinguist, the grammarian, and the missionary, and will also be\r\ninvaluable to the student of African ethnology and to the physical\r\nanthropologist.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter sketches the history of research into the Bantu\r\nlaguages. The contributions of various philosophists are appraised.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter on the distribution and character of the Bantu\r\nlanguages is of greatest interest to the layman and to the general\r\nanthropologist. We are informed that the Bantu languages \"constitute\r\na very distinct type of speech which, as contrasted with others\r\namongst the group of Negro tongues, is remarkable as a rule for\r\nItalian melodiousness, simplicity and frequency of its vowel sounds,\r\nand the comparative ease with which its exemplars can be acquired and\r\nspoken by Europeans\" (p. 15). \"This one Negro language family now\r\ncovers the whole of the southern third of Africa, with the exception\r\nof very small areas in the southwest (still inhabited sparsely by\r\nHottentot and Bushman tribes) and a few patches of the inner Congo\r\nbasin\" (p. 15). Throughout Africa, north of the Bantu border line, the\r\ntraveller meets with numerous languages widely different and mutually\r\nincomprehensible whereas with a knowledge of one Bantu language it is\r\nnot difficult to understand the structure and even the vocabulary of\r\nothers. The importance of this language family in Africa is therefore\r\nobvious. The author defines clearly the special and peculiar\r\ncharacteristics of Bantu languages. There follows an interesting\r\ndiscussion of the origin and spread of these languages. Probably the\r\nparent speech was spoken originally in the very heart of Africa,\r\nsomewhere between the basins of the Upper Nile, the Bahr-al-ghazal,\r\nthe Mubangi, and the Upper Benue. The archaic Bantu seem first to have\r\nmoved eastward, toward the Mountain Nile and the Great Lakes. Probably\r\nthey remained in the Nile Valley north of the Albert Nyanza \"till at\r\nleast as late as three or four hundred years before Christ--late\r\nenough to have been in full possession of goats and oxen and to have\r\nreceived the domestic fowl from Egypt or Abyssinia. They then embarked\r\nupon their great career of conquering and colonizing the southern\r\nthird of Africa\" (p. 22).\r\n\r\nThe original Bantu invaders found before them in Central and South\r\nAfrica other peoples--Negroes of different types, pygmies, Bushmen,\r\nand Hottentots. \"The first great Bantu migrations undoubtedly emanated\r\nfrom the vicinity of the Victoria Nyanza and the north Tanganyika, and\r\nwere directed round and not through the Congo forests\" (p. 24). On the\r\nbasis of linguistic, ethnological and anthropological evidence Sir\r\nHarry is led to deduce that at a critical period in their career the\r\nNegro speakers of the early Bantu languages were brought under the\r\ninfluence of a semi-Caucasian race from the north or northeast. This\r\ncontact gave rise to the many handsome-featured pale-skinned castes\r\nand ruling clans in so many of the Bantu peoples.\r\n\r\nThe following statement is of great anthropological importance: \"The\r\nBantu-speaking peoples of Africa, ... do _not_ constitute a race apart\r\nfrom the other negroes or offer any homogeneity of physical type. But\r\non the whole they represent so much the average negro type that\r\n'Bantu' is still in favor as a physical definition among\r\ncraniologists. In reality, they are just fifty millions of Negroes\r\nwhose speech belongs to one of the many language families of 'Negro\r\ntype'; only in this case the language family instead of being confined\r\nin its range to a hundred villages or two hundred square miles, is\r\nspread over the southern third of Africa--say over 3,500,000 square\r\nmiles--from the Cameroons, the Northern Congo, the Nyanzas, and the\r\nMombasa coast to Cape Colony and Natal\" (p. 25), Bantu languages are\r\nspoken by peoples of diverse physical types.\r\n\r\n\"Yet about the Bantu speech and the culture which accompanies it\r\n(ordinarily) there is a suggestion, strengthened by the association of\r\nthese languages with metal working (iron more especially), with\r\nagriculture, cultivated plants, and cattle-keeping, that adds to the\r\nimpression derived from their legends, their religious beliefs, games,\r\nand weapons. It is thought that the Bantu language family was finally\r\nmoulded by some non-Negro incomers of possibly Hamitic affinities,\r\nakin at any rate in physique and culture, if not in language, to the\r\ndynastic Egyptians, the Galas, and perhaps most of all to those\r\n'Ethiopians' of mixed Egyptian and Negro-Nubian stock that down to one\r\nthousand years ago inhabited the Nile basin south of Wadi Halfa and\r\nnorth of Kordofan.\" (Pp. 25-26.)\r\n\r\nSir Harry attributes most of the higher cultural elements associated\r\nwith the Bantu languages to the non-Negro invaders. He believes that\r\nthe Bantu invasions of southern and central Africa cannot be referred\r\nback much earlier than the second century B. C., and that the\r\ndifferentiation of the more than two hundred forms of Bantu speech\r\noccurred subsequently and rapidly.\r\n\r\nTo the student of African ethnography this volume is a great\r\ndisappointment in one respect. The sketch map showing the distribution\r\nof Bantu and Semi-Bantu languages is absurdly inadequate. The writer\r\nof this review had confidently expected an authoritative large-scale\r\nmap showing the distribution of linguistic families, dialects, and\r\ntribes. It is to be hoped that such a map will form a part of the\r\ncompleted work.\r\n\r\n                                        E. A.

Volume VIII, 1877-1896. The\r\n     Macmillan Company, New York, 1919. Pp. 484.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to be a continuation of Mr. Rhodes _History of the\r\nUnited States from the Compromise of 1850 to the Final Restoration of\r\nHome Rule at the South in 1877_. As one, however, considers the\r\ntreatment of the former work in comparison with this recent treatise,\r\nhe must conclude that the author has not maintained the standard set\r\nin his earlier volumes which show deeper insight and a more scientific\r\npoint of view. Persons who have looked forward to the continuation of\r\nMr. Rhodes's comprehensive history from the transition period of\r\nHayes' administration will certainly be disappointed in observing how\r\nhe has failed in tracing the threads of history, which in our time,\r\nhave become momentous. After reading the volume one is still at a loss\r\nas to what forces in our national life the author considers as being\r\nactually in the making during the period which the volume covers.\r\n\r\nThe work begins with a treatment of Hayes' administration setting\r\nforth facts which have appeared elsewhere in the author's studies in\r\nthis particular period. As in other works, the author defends almost\r\neverything Hayes did and arraigns the Reconstruction Republicans who\r\nwere opposed to him. He then presents in an unscientific way the brief\r\ndiscussion of economic questions bearing on railroad rates, wages,\r\nstrikes, mobs and riots. Financial depression, the silver question and\r\nthe valuable service of John Sherman are given considerable attention.\r\nValuable facts are set forth in his discussion of civil service\r\nreform, the tariff commission and the Chinese question. Too much of\r\nthe book, however, is devoted to merely political matter involving a\r\ndetailed discussion of campaigns and elections at the expense of the\r\neconomic, constitutional and diplomatic movements decidedly\r\ninfluencing the history of this country.\r\n\r\nIn this work the author pays very little attention to the Negro except\r\nas he leaves the impression that the race was justly deprived of the\r\nsuffrage and of holding office. He makes reference to the complaint of\r\nthe Republicans to show that in disfranchising the Negro in the South\r\nto make that section solidly Democratic that every white voter in the\r\nSouth thereafter possessed the political power of two white voters in\r\nthe North. He mentions also the federal election laws and the Force\r\nBill but finally concludes that the experiment of making the Negro a\r\ncitizen was a failure. Here again Mr. Rhodes shows his lack of\r\nknowledge of human affairs in that he studies history only in the\r\npresent tense. No man at present is wise enough to say whether we\r\nshall finally obtain more good than bad results from the\r\nReconstruction, for we are too close to that part of our history to\r\nmake a proper estimate of these events.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _The Negro Year Book._ Edited by MONROE N.

This volume appears with a table\r\nof contents and a useful index to the numerous facts compiled. The\r\nvolume not only covers the field of former editions but includes also\r\nmuch up to date material throwing light on Negro current history. The\r\nvery first portion of the work is entitled _Fifty-three Years of\r\nProgress, 1866-1919_. This is a statistical study of Negro schools,\r\nNegro ownership of property, and Negro enterprise. The reader will be\r\ninterested in such information as illiteracy, music, painters, actors,\r\noccupations, agriculture, business, and the study of crime.\r\n\r\nThe Negro Year Book is a desirable step in the right direction. Mr.\r\nWork and his coworkers deserve unusual praise for this undertaking in\r\na field where for a number of years yet to come the returns must\r\nnecessarily be meagre. The work meets a long felt want of statistical\r\ninformation as to exactly what the Negro people are doing. These facts\r\nwill serve not only as an inspiration to the race itself but to refute\r\nso much misinformation often circulated to do Negroes injury. It is\r\nearnestly hoped that the managers of this work will find it possible\r\nin the near future to publish an annual volume and to this end the\r\npublic should give the movement unstinted support to make such an\r\nundertaking financially profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has published a\r\nmonograph entitled _Negro Migration during the War_ by Mr. Emmett J.\r\nScott, Secretary-Treasurer of Howard University.

It has such interesting chapters as the causes of\r\nthe migration, stimulation of the movement, the call of the\r\nself-sufficient North, the draining of the black belt, efforts to\r\ncheck the movement, the effect of the migration on the South, the\r\nsituation in the congested districts in the North and West, and\r\nremedies for relief.

Yet\r\nalthough this question was then one of the disturbing factors in our\r\nrelations with Great Britain, it has hitherto passed unnoticed.[2] As\r\na large number of Negroes were taken from the United States by Great\r\nBritain during the Revolutionary War there followed so much effort to\r\nsecure the return of these Negroes that the subject had to be dealt\r\nwith in the Treaty of Paris which ended the war in 1783. So numerous\r\nwere the infractions of the stipulation prohibiting the carrying off\r\nof the Negroes and so fruitless were the discussions resulting from\r\nthe non-fulfillment of the articles in the treaty that several\r\ndiplomatic representatives were sent on missions to Great Britain, the\r\nlast of which ended with the Jay Treaty of 1794. Obviously, no\r\nsatisfactory settlement as to the Negro could then be reached. An\r\narray of evidence from the sources[3] shows that the question was\r\nfrequently discussed and that its significance lies in its absence\r\nfrom the stipulations of the Jay Treaty. It is evident, moreover, that\r\nthe United States was not satisfied with this treaty and that between\r\nGreat Britain and this country there was widening a breach which\r\nculminated in the War of 1812, during which Great Britain committed\r\nthe same offence that she did during the war for independence.[4]\r\n\r\nHow can one account then for the unfavorable attitude of Great Britain\r\ntoward the return of the Negro fugitives? The humanitarian spirit of\r\nGreat Britain which, by the celebrated decision of Lord Mansfield in\r\nthe Somerset case in 1772 guaranteed to every man his freedom as soon\r\nas he set foot on British soil, extended beyond the limits of the\r\nempire. Although this decision of the judge evoked some unfavorable\r\ncomment, for slavery was the \"normal condition of the Negro,\" his\r\nideas were disseminated by the military authorities defending the\r\nCrown in America. During the Revolutionary War many of the British\r\ncommanders issued proclamations of freedom to the Negro slaves. Lord\r\nDunmore, the dethroned Governor of Virginia, was among the first to\r\nissue a proclamation of freedom[5] to all Negroes who would fight for\r\nthe King. Soon thereafter, Clinton,[6] the Commander-in-chief of the\r\nBritish forces in America, issued a proclamation to the same effect.\r\nStill later, Cornwallis issued a proclamation specifying the grant of\r\n\"freedom and protection\" to all Negroes who would seek his command.\r\nWhatever motive prompted the issuance of these orders, it is evident\r\nthat the status of the Negro during this \"emergency\" as regarded by\r\nGreat Britain was that of a freeman.\r\n\r\nTo these proclamations many Negroes responded. For instance, General\r\nGreene learned on Long Island that a group of Negroes aggregating two\r\nhundred (200) had in July, 1776, sought freedom within the British\r\nlines and had been accepted as a regiment in that vicinity.[7] He\r\nreported, moreover, to General Washington in 1781 that enough Negroes\r\nin North Carolina to form two regiments had sought British freedom and\r\nprotection and that they were being organized by the British.[8]\r\nWhether they came within the British lines as a result of these\r\nproclamations or in recognition of the laws of war \"it has been\r\ncomputed by good judges\" says Ramsay,[9] \"that at the evacuation of\r\none part, two hundred and forty-one Negroes and their families were\r\ntaken off to St. Lucia in one transport, the _Scimitar_; and that\r\nbetween the years 1775 and 1783, 25,000 Negroes, that is, one-fifth of\r\nall the slaves, were taken from the State of South Carolina.\" In\r\nGeorgia,[10] there was made a report that the loss was much greater,\r\nprobably three-fourths or seven-eighths of all the Negroes in the\r\nState. Again, from an estimate made at the time, Jefferson observed\r\nthat about thirty thousand Negroes were taken from Virginia.[11] From\r\nthe other slave-holding States which were invaded by the British, many\r\nother Negroes were carried away from their masters. So effectively was\r\nthe scheme carried out that fear was expressed throughout the South\r\nless the economic position of that section would be threatened. In\r\nconsequence of such actions on the part of Great Britain, General\r\nWashington receded from the position of excluding Negroes from the\r\nAmerican Army and took drastic steps in preventing the carrying away\r\nof other Negroes by Great Britain.[12]\r\n\r\nConsidered, therefore, as an American slave in time of peace and an\r\nAmerican soldier in time of danger, it is no anomaly that the status\r\nof the Negro complicated the negotiations between military\r\nrepresentatives of Great Britain and the United States. Extended but\r\nfruitless negotiations ensued. A satisfactory settlement of the return\r\nof the Negroes seemed impossible. With independence assured through\r\nthe representatives assembled, the Treaty of Paris was negotiated in\r\n1783. Franklin urged in his communication with Oswald, 1779, that the\r\nquestion as to the return of Negroes taken away by Great Britain be\r\nadjusted immediately.[13] This suggestion was strengthened by the\r\nsupport given it by the American representative, Henry Laurens, who\r\nhad been in confinement in London during the war and whose chance\r\narrival on the closing day gave the subject increased importance. Thus\r\ncredit for the incorporation of the article on the Negro into the\r\nTreaty of Paris is given to Henry Laurens.[14]\r\n\r\nBy the Seventh Article of the Treaty of Paris,[15] it was stipulated\r\nthat the British troops should withdraw from the United States without\r\ncarrying away or destroying any property belonging to the citizens of\r\nthe United States. In spite of this agreement at the peace conference,\r\nthis stipulation was not fulfilled by Great Britain. Convincing\r\nevidence of an infraction of this stipulation is seen in a letter\r\nwritten by General Washington to Sir Guy Carleton, May 6, 1783, in\r\nwhich the former expressed himself as being surprised to hear that\r\nembarkations of Negroes had taken place during the whole of that\r\nyear.[16] He, moreover, expressed his private opinion to the effect\r\nthat such an action \"is totally different from the letter and spirit\r\nof the treaty.\" A few days thereafter the Virginia delegates in\r\nCongress wrote to the Governor of Virginia that they would make this\r\nthe subject of a \"pointed remonstrance from our minister in Europe to\r\nthe British Court with a demand for reparation and in the meantime\r\nurge General Washington to insist on a more faithful observance of\r\nthat stipulation at New York.\"[17]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding further orders which were issued by Sir Guy Carleton,\r\nMay 12, 1783, to prevent the carrying away of any Negroes or other\r\nproperty of the American inhabitants many other infractions of the\r\nprovision were reported.[18] Even General Washington remarked[19]\r\nthat \"some of his own slaves and those of friends living with him were\r\nprobably carried away to New York.\" \"If by chance,\" continued he, \"you\r\nshould come at the knowledge of any of them, I will be much obliged by\r\nyour securing them so that I can obtain them again.\" So numerous were\r\nthe violations of this part of the treaty that Thomas Jefferson,\r\nSecretary of State, in a letter written to Vergennes, the Foreign\r\nMinister of France, asked for suggestions from France in regard to the\r\ninfractions of this article of the Treaty of Paris. In it, he\r\nexpressed the objection of the Crown, which was to the effect that\r\nNegroes had come within the British lines under the promise of freedom\r\nand protection and that this promise was fulfilled by Great Britain in\r\npreference to the stipulation in the treaty.[20]\r\n\r\nThe situation became more aggravated. The breach between the two\r\ncountries was gradually widening. Sensing this acute situation,\r\nWashington suggested that Carleton meet him in a conference at\r\nOrangetown, New Jersey, May, 1783. At one of their meetings Washington\r\ncalled the attention of Carleton to several resolutions passed by\r\nCongress relating to the return of all Negroes and other property of\r\nAmerican inhabitants taken away by the British forces. Concerning\r\nthese, Carleton replied that he wished to be considered as giving no\r\nconstruction of the treaty, but that he \"conceived it could not have\r\nbeen the intention of the British Government by the treaty of peace to\r\nreduce themselves to the necessity of violating their faith to the\r\nNegroes who came within the British lines under the proclamation of\r\nthe predecessors in command.\"[21] In point of fact, however, he said\r\n\"delivering up the Negroes to their former masters would be delivering\r\nthem up--some to execution and others to punishments which would in\r\nhis own opinion be a dishonorable violation of the public faith.\" He\r\nconcluded, nevertheless, that if the sending off of the Negroes should\r\nhereafter be declared an infraction of the treaty, \"compensation ought\r\nto be made by Great Britain to the owners.\"[22]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the last suggestion of Carleton, Washington observed that\r\nmany difficulties would arise in compensating the proprietors for\r\ntheir Negroes. He also thought it impossible to ascertain the value of\r\nthe Negroes, for the value of a slave, contended he, \"consists chiefly\r\nin his industry and sobriety.\" Another difficulty Washington observed\r\nwas that of identifying the slave. He was of the opinion that the\r\nslave would give the wrong name of his master. Washington considered\r\nthis conduct on the part of General Carleton, moreover, a departure\r\nfrom both the letter and spirit of the Seventh Article of the Treaty\r\nof Paris.\r\n\r\nIn answer to these contentions Carleton said that as the Negroes were\r\nfree and secured against their masters they could have no inducement\r\nto conceal their true name or that of their masters. In commending\r\ncompensation Carleton was of the opinion that he was pursuing a course\r\nwhich would operate most for the security of the proprietors. \"If the\r\nNegroes were left to themselves,\" he remarked, \"numbers of them would\r\nvery probably go off and not return to the parts of the country from\r\nwhence they came or clandestinely would get on board the transports in\r\nsuch a manner as would not be in his power to prevent.\" \"In either\r\ncase,\" continued Carleton, \"an inevitable loss would ensue to the\r\nproprietors.\"[23] But as the business was then conducted they had at\r\nleast a chance for compensation.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with these views, Carleton suggested that commissioners\r\nbe appointed by the two countries \"to agree upon the mode of\r\ncompensating as well as the amount and other points with respect to\r\nwhich there was no provision made in the treaty.\" This suggestion was\r\napproved by Congress, and in compliance with it Egbert Benson,\r\nWilliam Smith, and Daniel Parker were appointed[24] with specific\r\ninstructions from Washington to \"assist representatives of Great\r\nBritain in inspecting and superintending the embarkation of persons\r\nand property in fulfillment of the Seventh Article of the Treaty of\r\nParis.\"[25]\r\n\r\nThese commissioners began their work immediately by examining the\r\nclaim of one Phillip Lott to a Negro named Thomas Francis[26] on board\r\na vessel called the _Fair American_ in New York harbor and about to be\r\ncarried to the island of Jamaica. Concerning this inquiry a pointed\r\nremonstrance was made to Sir Guy Carleton. After the details of the\r\nexamination were presented to him, the commissioners requested Great\r\nBritain to prohibit its representatives from carrying away the Negro\r\nand to deliver Francis to Lott. Notifying Washington, June 14, 1783,\r\nof their progress, the commissioners reminded him that Sir Guy\r\nCarleton intimated an impropriety in the claim, as the property was\r\nnot suggested to be in danger of being sent away. \"This left room,\"\r\nsaid the commissioners, \"for an idea that possibly property about to\r\nbe sent away would be restored ... and we conceive it is now reduced\r\nto a certainty that all applications for the delivery of property will\r\nbe fruitless and we therefore desist from them.\"[27]\r\n\r\nA few days later the commissioners reported to Washington that in\r\nsuperintending an embarkation of fourteen transports bound for Nova\r\nScotia \"about 3000 souls, among whom were at least 130 Negroes who\r\nappeared to be property of the citizens of the United States,\" were\r\ncarried away. They also indicated that these embarkations were made in\r\nspite of their presence and remonstrance and for this reason asked\r\nGeneral Washington for \"further directions on this subject.\"[28] Other\r\nreports of the commissioners to General Washington, June 17, 1783,\r\nshow that on many other occasions Negroes not residing within the\r\nBritish lines were taken away. To the remonstrances of the\r\ncommissioners, Sir Guy Carleton gave a deaf ear. They, in the\r\nmeantime, wrote General Washington that they had interpreted\r\nCarleton's silence as a \"determination that all future applications\r\nshould remain equally unnoticed.\" That they realized that their\r\nefforts were fruitless goes without saying, for they confessed that\r\ntheir work was ineffective and that the British vessels were never\r\nsubjected to any rigid inspections and it was, therefore, impossible\r\nto determine, from the register provided by Sir Guy Carleton, the\r\nexact number of Negroes carried away in those vessels.[29]\r\n\r\nThe work of the commissioners, nevertheless, was noteworthy. They\r\ncalled Washington's attention to the fact that Sir Guy Carleton\r\naffected to distinguish between the cases of such Negroes as came\r\nwithin the British lines in consequence of the promise of freedom and\r\nprotection promulgated by Carleton's predecessors and such as came in\r\neither previous to the proclamations or subsequent to the cessation of\r\nhostilities. \"Negroes of the first description,\" insisted Carleton,\r\n\"were not included in the treaty.\" The commissioners soon realized\r\nthat even this limited construction given to the article was not\r\nintended to be fulfilled by Carleton's subordinate officers. They\r\nbased their contention upon the fact that printed certificates\r\ngranting Negroes the privilege of embarking[30] were distributed by\r\nthe commandant of New York City, \"as their convenience might\r\nrequire.\"[31] These certificates fell into the hands of many persons\r\nfor whom they were not intended. So loosely were they distributed that\r\none was picked up by the commissioners who transmitted the same to\r\nGeneral Washington.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the commissioners insisted that the treaty\r\nstipulated specifically that his Brittanic Majesty should withdraw all\r\nhis armies, garrisons and fleets from the United States and from every\r\nport, place and harbor within the same without causing any destruction\r\nor carrying away any Negroes or other property of the American\r\ninhabitants.[32] With these two interpretations of the Seventh Article\r\ninvariably insisted upon by Carleton on the one hand and the\r\ncommissioners on the other an agreement was less likely to be reached\r\nand, in spite of the efforts to the contrary, the deportation of\r\nNegroes took place steadily until all the British departed.[33]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Congress was discussing the ratification of the\r\nTreaty of Paris. The non-observance of the Seventh Article on the part\r\nof Great Britain and the destruction worked by Carleton evoked many\r\nresolutions opposing the ratification of the treaty for the expressed\r\nreason that it did not provide for the loss of Negroes. One of these\r\nresolutions was to the effect that it was \"inexpedient to concur in\r\npassing laws necessary for carrying into effect the treaty.\"[34] These\r\nefforts of Congress, however, like those of the commissioners were of\r\nno avail. Complaints of American citizens of the loss of their\r\nproperty were expressed by the representatives in Congress. They, to\r\nbe sure, had their effect, for soon thereafter, Congress transferred\r\nthe question of the return of Negroes to the realm of actual\r\ndiplomacy.[35]\r\n\r\nJohn Adams, 1788, who, by the way, was one of the representatives of\r\nthe United States who signed the Treaty of Paris, received an\r\nappointment as representative of this country to England to settle the\r\nalleged violations of the Treaty of Paris. He was instructed in 1785\r\nto press for a fulfillment of the terms of the treaty of peace on the\r\npart of Great Britain.[36] He had little time, however, to press his\r\nclaim before representatives of Great Britain were inquiring why the\r\nUnited States did not perform her part in this reciprocal contract. To\r\nthese inquiries, Adams replied that \"America could not; that it was\r\nhardly a government at all.\" He, moreover, informed Congress that the\r\nreason assigned by Laurens for incorporating the Seventh Article was\r\nthat the people of the United States would be unable to comply with\r\nthe part of the treaty which respects debts unless the provision which\r\nrespects Negroes was made. \"This construction,\" he continued, \"was\r\nnever denied and that it seemed to be understood by the ministry that\r\non a settlement with the United States compensation must be made.\"\r\n\r\nObviously, then, both Great Britain and America understood that the\r\nSeventh Article would be fulfilled by Great Britain only when the\r\nFourth, Fifth and Sixth Articles were fulfilled by the United\r\nStates.[37] This point, however, was discussed pro and con for many\r\nmonths and was seldom admitted by the American diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives, Adams himself said that he could \"get no comfort from\r\nhis mission.\" The construction given the Seventh Article making its\r\nfulfillment by Great Britain contingent upon the execution of other\r\nprovisions only complicated matters.\r\n\r\nAnother mission was planned in 1789,[38] but before another\r\nrepresentative was appointed Washington urged upon Gouverneur Morris,\r\nwho contemplated visiting London, \"to find out the reasons why Great\r\nBritain had not complied with the Seventh Article.\" In a letter\r\nwritten to Morris, October 13, 1789, Washington desired Morris to\r\nconverse with his Brittanic Majesty's Ministers as to whether there\r\nwas any objection to performing those articles remaining to be\r\nperformed on his part. \"Learn with precision,\" he concluded, \"what\r\nthey mean to do on this head.\" In compliance with this request, on\r\nApril 7, 1790, Morris interviewed the British representative, the Duke\r\nof Leeds, who gave to him only \"general assurances\" for a faithful\r\nobservance of the articles and, becoming a \"little embarrassed,\" could\r\nnot say how the matter in regard to the Negroes stood. After many days\r\nof silence, the Duke of Leeds, April 23, 1790, \"lamented every\r\ncircumstance\" which delayed the fulfillment of engagements on the part\r\nof the United States.[39] He also indicated that, if circumstances\r\nrendered their final completion impracticable, he had no scruples in\r\ndeclaring the object of Great Britain would be to \"retard the\r\nfulfillment of such subsequent parts of the treaty as depend entirely\r\nupon Great Britain until redress is granted to their subjects upon the\r\nspecific points of the treaty itself or a fair and just compensation\r\nfor the non-performance of those engagements on the part of the United\r\nStates.\"[40]\r\n\r\nInforming Washington of his progress, May 29, 1790, Morris disclosed\r\nthe fact that he was no longer contending for the return of the\r\nNegroes, for that would involve either \"breaking faith\" with those\r\nwhom they had seduced by the offer of freedom or the violation of the\r\nstipulation which they had made with the United States in the Treaty\r\nof Paris. In presenting America's side, however, he insisted upon\r\ncompensation in order that it would not be difficult for the planters\r\nto show that they had sustained a heavy loss from the want of men to\r\ncultivate their lands and thereby produce the means of paying their\r\ndebts. To this the Duke of Leeds replied that he wished to \"consider\r\nthe treaty subject generally\" and thought that some compensation could\r\nbe mutually made. He declared, nevertheless, that he would rather\r\n\"make a new treaty than perform the Seventh Article of the Treaty of\r\nParis.\"[41]\r\n\r\nSubsequent diplomatic negotiations between Jefferson and Hammond, the\r\nMinister of Great Britain, indicate that Washington was not satisfied\r\nwith the status of the case after Jefferson cited specific infractions\r\nof the Seventh Article of the treaty, enclosing documents supporting\r\nthese claims. Hammond informed the United States, November 30, 1791,\r\nthat the King had suspended the execution of the Seventh Article in\r\nconsequence of the non-compliance on the part of the United States of\r\nthe Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Articles. In short, he insisted that the\r\nstipulations should be performed in the order in which they stood. He\r\nstated, moreover, that the \"two objects were so mutually connected\r\nwith each other as not to admit of separation either in the mode of\r\ndiscussing them or in any subsequent engagements which might result\r\nfrom that discussion.\"[42]\r\n\r\nIt was soon evident then that such extended discussions were\r\nfruitless. This state of affairs, to be sure, could not exist very\r\nmuch longer. Citizens of the United States were pressing \"more\r\nzealously\" for the return of the Negroes. For almost a decade the\r\nsubject had been discussed without an amicable adjustment. In a\r\ncommunication to the Congress, April 16, 1794, Washington showed that\r\nhe had grasped the situation by informing that body of the fact that\r\n\"despatches received from our minister in London contain a serious\r\naspect of our affairs with Great Britain.\" He suggested, therefore, to\r\nthe Senate that an envoy extraordinary be sent to England. To this end\r\nWashington appointed John Jay to settle the infractions of the Treaty\r\nof Paris.[43]\r\n\r\nIn Jay's instructions nothing was specifically said concerning the\r\ncarrying away of the Negroes by the British, but, as it appeared from\r\nsubsequent transactions, it is quite certain that the infractions of\r\nthe Seventh Article as well as those of other articles were to be\r\nadjusted. In this wise, the \"irrepressible question\"--relating to the\r\nreturn of Negroes carried away by Great Britain during the\r\nRevolutionary War became one of the purposes of Jay's mission.[44]\r\n\r\nDuring the negotiation with Grenville there took place many heated\r\ndebates, in which each party accused the other of the first\r\naggression. Meanwhile Jay ascertained, September 13, 1794, that\r\nGrenville supported the contention held by his predecessors, that the\r\narticle of the treaty was intended to prevent depredations at the\r\ndeparture of the army; that no alteration in the actual state of\r\nproperty was intended by the Seventh Article; that every Negro who\r\nstrayed or escaped from the American lines and came into the lines of\r\nthe British Army became by the laws of war British property; and that\r\nto extend the Seventh Article of the treaty to include Negroes who\r\ncame within the British lines under the proclamation of freedom was to\r\ngive it a \"wider latitude than the terms of it would warrant.\"[45] In\r\nshort, Grenville contended that in regard to those within the British\r\nlines before the signing of the treaty they were \"left entirely\r\nwithout restrictions.\"[46]\r\n\r\nIn reply to Grenville's argument Jay divided the subject of the\r\nNegroes into three groups: first, the Negroes captured or disposed of\r\nduring the course of the war; second, the Negroes who remained with\r\nand belonged to American citizens within the British lines; and third,\r\nthe Negroes who, confiding in the promise of freedom, fled from their\r\nmasters and took refuge with the British. Concerning the first two\r\ngroups, no extended discussion followed. Grenville stated, however, in\r\nregard to the second group, that he was \"not so sure.\" The last-named\r\ngroup on the other hand, produced much pourparler, for Jay maintained\r\nthat these Negroes were \"clearly comprehended by the terms of the\r\ntreaty.\" According to his argument, Negroes could not by \"mere\r\nflight\" alter their slave character. He soon appreciated the difficult\r\nposition of England in trying to keep the pledges of freedom offered\r\nto the Negroes and at the same time fulfill, according to the American\r\ninterpretation, the article of the treaty in regard to the return of\r\nNegroes.\r\n\r\nDuring the negotiation Jay admitted, moreover, that the carrying away\r\nof Negroes was justifiable in view of the promises of freedom and\r\nprotection promulgated by British military representatives.[47] He\r\nconcluded, however, with the thought that \"Great Britain ought not to\r\nexpect to escape the consequence of the folly of her Generals in\r\nAmerica.\" For this reason he restated the idea expressed by other\r\nAmerican representatives to Great Britain, that compensation should be\r\nobtained for the Negroes carried away. In spite of Jay's change of\r\nposition Grenville persisted with unyielding opposition in the view\r\nthat such slaves were no longer American property. \"On this point\"\r\nwrote Jay to Randolph, \"we could not agree.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning this question, Jay said, moreover,[48] that \"various\r\narticles have been under consideration but did not meet with mutual\r\napprobation and consent.\" Sensing the situation Randolph declared to\r\nJay, December 3, that he was extremely afraid that the reasoning of\r\nGrenville about the Negroes would not be satisfactory. \"Indeed I own,\"\r\nsaid Randolph, \"that I can not myself yield to its force.\" Randolph\r\nknew of the anti-British sentiment in the South and realized that the\r\ntreaty would be opposed by the South because that section would feel\r\nthat it had been neglected,[49] should it receive no compensation for\r\nthe Negroes carried away by the British.\r\n\r\nIn a communication to Jay two weeks later it is obvious that there was\r\nno concerted opinion even in America in regard to the much mooted\r\nquestion. Jay and Randolph, for instance, differed as to whether the\r\nslaves concerned ever became the property of Great Britain. Jay held\r\nthat the Negroes in question never became the property of Great\r\nBritain whereas, Randolph held that while property is acquired in\r\nmovables as soon as they come within the power of the enemy, yet\r\n\"property rights thus acquired in war may by the treaty of peace be\r\nremoved.\"[50]\r\n\r\nTo the contention of Great Britain that the Seventh Article meant\r\nmerely an engagement against further depredations, Randolph declared\r\nthe stipulation \"superfluous\"; for he maintained that the mere\r\ncessation of war meant that much. To this point, Grenville declared\r\nthe treaty \"odious,\" if the stipulation were interpreted to include\r\nNegroes who sought British lines under the promise of freedom and\r\nprotection \"on the basis of common morality.\" Great Britain was not to\r\nbe expected to execute a stipulation with such an interpretation.\r\nObviously, then, Great Britain would not recede from her position.\r\nCitizens of America, especially those deprived of their property, were\r\nbeginning to think that our diplomatic relations were not properly\r\ntaken care of by Jay. Expressions of disapproval of the treaty by\r\nresolutions in the Senate evinced the temper of the people. Jay, in\r\nthe meantime was called \"traitor\"; his mission was declared a failure\r\nand the treaty was attacked from many sides.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture special mention must be made of the objections of the\r\nsoutherners on the ground that the treaty did not provide for the\r\nreturn of their property, while the objection of the North was not so\r\npressing. In fact, northerners acquiesced in the opinion of Hamilton\r\nwho had substantially the same view that Grenville had.[51] Thus we\r\nsee the first glimpse of the North becoming estranged from the South\r\nbecause of the difference of opinion in regard to the Negro.\r\n\r\nThe leading source of dissatisfaction of the treaty of Jay seemed to\r\nbe a failure to get compensation for the Negroes carried away by Great\r\nBritain. The stipulation, moreover, was not definite, for many\r\nconstructions could be placed upon it. The words of the treaty,\r\nmoreover, were too vague and uncertain to express accurately the\r\nintention of the signers. Whether Negroes whom the British carried\r\naway could any longer be considered American property, seemed to be\r\nthe crux of the situation. Although no definite settlement could be\r\nreached by the two nations, authorities of international law[52] give\r\nthe case to Great Britain. One rule which was recognized by the\r\nforemost nations of the world was to the effect that a slave escaping\r\nin war becomes free. Concerning this Halleck says that such slaves\r\ncannot be regained by their former masters.[53] Woolsey says that \"a\r\nslave sojourning to a free land cannot be treated as his master's\r\nproperty--as destitute of jural capacity.\" To the same purport,\r\nHeffter says \"in no case is a state bound to allow the slavery which\r\nsubsists in others.\" Dana, in his edition of Wheaton's _International\r\nLaw_ supports this contention.[54]\r\n\r\nDissatisfied with results but not discouraged, however, Washington\r\nappointed commissioners, December 7th, 1798, to work with\r\ncommissioners from Great Britain and proceed with the infractions of\r\nthe treaty. A short time thereafter President Adams in an address to\r\nCongress, November 23, 1797, reported that several decisions on the\r\nclaims of citizens of the United States for losses and damages\r\nsustained by reason of irregular and illegal captures or condemnations\r\nof their vessels or other property had been made by the commissioners\r\nin London, conformably to the Seventh Article of the Treaty. \"The sums\r\nawarded by the Commissioners,\" said he, \"have been paid by the British\r\nGovernment; a considerable number of other claims where costs and\r\ndamages and not captured property were the only objects in question\r\nhave been decided by arbitration, and the sums awarded to the citizens\r\nof the United States have also been paid.\"[55] These decisions served\r\nto allay the discontent in America. Still later, Adams informed\r\nCongress that \"such progress had been made in the examination and\r\ndecision of cases ... which were the subject of the Seventh Article\r\nthat it is supposed the Commissioners will be able to bring their\r\nbusiness to a conclusion in August of the ensuing year.\"[56]\r\n\r\nNo account of the final settlement of these claims, however, is found\r\nin the sources. Dissatisfaction became more intense. Claimants were\r\npressing on all sides for a fair compensation for the loss of their\r\nproperty. So serious was the situation that the House of\r\nRepresentatives went beyond its accustomed limitation and discussed in\r\n1798 the treaty-making power of the United States. Pressure had been\r\nbrought to bear upon the representatives of the people because the Jay\r\nTreaty had been ratified by the President and Senate and it did not\r\ncontain a provision covering the return of the Negroes.\r\n\r\nFurther efforts, nevertheless, were made to adjust the differences\r\nbetween the two countries. They, however, were of little avail. The\r\nRepublican policy of Jefferson which this country strictly followed\r\nfrom 1801 to 1809 had as its basic principle that governments ought to\r\ndo as little as possible. Hence our army and navy were cut down to the\r\nextent that the American Government could not assert itself against\r\nforeign encroachment. Particularly in 1804 our relations with Great\r\nBritain became worse when the Jay Treaty of 1794 by agreement was\r\nallowed to expire. To compel Great Britain to come to terms Congress\r\nenacted a non-important act which never had the desired effect.\r\n\r\nSoon thereafter the continental system and the paper blockade engaged\r\nthe attention of the American Government. Negotiations had failed.\r\nGreat Britain would not make a treaty. The accumulation of injuries\r\ncalled for action of some kind. To yield and say nothing meant to give\r\nup the rights of an independent nation. For this reason Jefferson\r\nintroduced in 1807 the Embargo with which he hoped to force France as\r\nwell as Great Britain to come to terms--to recognize the United States\r\nas a \"free sovereign and independent nation.\" Meanwhile a spirit of\r\nnationality was developing in the country. Soon thereafter war was\r\ndeclared and waged against Great Britain to win the respect and honor\r\nwhich every nation deserves.\r\n\r\nIn this state of war the provisions of the Treaty of Paris and the Jay\r\nTreaty were nullified. In response to an inquiry as to whether these\r\ntreaties, so far as they were not fully executed, terminated by the\r\nWar of 1812, the British Department of State in a communication\r\nreplied that \"with respect to the treaties you are informed that they\r\nwere claimed by Great Britain at the conclusion of the Treaty of Ghent\r\nto have terminated by the War of 1812.\"\r\n\r\nAgainst this view the United States protested. In the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States in the case of the Society for the\r\nPropagation of the Gospel v. the Town of New Haven, the view was\r\nexpressed that provisions of a treaty remain in full force in spite of\r\nwar.[57] The general rule of inter-national law, however, is that war\r\nterminates all subsisting treaties between the belligerent powers.[58]\r\nThe United States, moreover, soon acquiesced in this view, for\r\nPresident Polk in his message to Congress, December 7, 1847, said, \"a\r\nstate of war abrogates treaties previously existing between the\r\nbelligerents.\"[59] Great Britain then was legally excused by the best\r\nauthorities of the world from executing fully the provisions of the\r\nTreaty of 1783 and the Jay Treaty of 1794.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the same policy in regard to the carrying away of Negroes\r\nwas followed during the War of 1812.[60] While the British forces were\r\noccupying the forts and harbors of the United States, Negroes came\r\nwithin their possession. Many were induced to run away while others\r\nwere captured in battles. From the Dauphin Islands-possessions\r\nclaimed to be without the limits of the newly acquired Louisiana\r\nterritory the British carried away slaves. In fact, from whatever\r\nplaces the British occupied they carried away Negroes. Many Negroes\r\ncame also into the possession of the British by the proclamation of\r\nAdmiral Cochrane of Great Britain, April 2, 1814, setting such loyal\r\nadherents free. In effect, this proclamation extended an invitation to\r\nall persons desiring to change their slave status. Although the\r\nproclamation[61] did not specify the Negroes, the meaning and object\r\nof Admiral Cochrane was evidently to bring Negroes within the British\r\nlines. Many, to be sure, responded to the proclamation. As many more,\r\nno doubt, were carried away from the United States by the British\r\nunder the veil that they were captives in the war and, therefore, no\r\nlonger the property of American inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWith victory assured and the representatives of Great Britain and\r\nAmerica assembled in Ghent, July 11, 1814, one of the first questions\r\nfor the commissioners to consider was evidently the return of the\r\nNegroes. This question had primary consideration in the final draft of\r\nthe Treaty of Ghent. By the first article of the treaty it was\r\nprovided that \"all possessions whatsoever taken by either party during\r\nthe war or which might have been taken after the signing of this\r\ntreaty shall be restored without delay and that these possessions\r\nshould not be destroyed.\" It specified, moreover, that artillery,\r\npublic and private property, originally captured in the forts of the\r\nUnited States should not be carried away.[62]\r\n\r\n\r\nNegroes were carried away by the British forces after the treaty was\r\nsigned as well as before. In Georgia many Negroes came into possession\r\nof the British at Cumberland Island fortified by Admiral Cockburn.[63]\r\nIn a letter dated November 22, 1914, Joseph Cabell gave evidence to\r\nsupport the above-mentioned facts when he declared that he was on\r\nboard a British squadron in Lynnhaven Bay at the time Major Thomas of\r\nYork attempted to recover his Negroes, who had gone off to the British\r\nand that the destination of the Negroes on board the ships was a\r\nsubject of curiosity and concern. Soon, however, he learned that they\r\nwere to be sold in the Bahamas.[64] From another reliable source comes\r\nthe information that a shameful traffic had been carried on in the\r\nWest Indies.[65] Secretary Monroe presented to the Senate, moreover,\r\nan affidavit of a Captain Williams who had been a prisoner in the\r\nBahamas for some time. In this he declared that he had been present at\r\nthe sale of Negroes taken from the vicinity of Norfolk and Hampton.\r\n\"This affidavit,\" said Monroe, \"was voluntarily given and the facts\r\nhave been corroborated by a variety of circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nSuch information was given in the Senate. In discussing the\r\nratification of the treaty the Senate suggested that commissioners be\r\nappointed to carry into effect the first article. In line with this\r\nview John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Albert Gallatin were\r\nauthorized to supervise the execution of this article. In a\r\ncommunication to Secretary Monroe, Feb. 23, 1815, the commissioners\r\nreported that \"all slaves and other private property are claimed to be\r\ndelivered up.\"[66]\r\n\r\nSo much progress in so short a time was remarkable. To adjust all the\r\nclaims in an amicable way would hardly occur. It was soon learned by\r\nthe commissioners that \"all slaves and other private property\" were\r\ndelivered up by the British using as their guide a different\r\nconstruction of Article I. \"The construction,\" Monroe said, \"ignored\r\nthe distinction which existed between public and private property.\"\r\nHad it been intended he continued, \"to put slaves and other private\r\nproperty on the same ground with artillery and other public property\r\nthe terms \"originally captured in the said forts or places which shall\r\nremain therein on the exchange of the ratification of the Treaty\"\r\nwould have followed at the end of the sentence after \"slaves and other\r\nprivate property.\"[67] With their construction, he contended that both\r\ninterests, the public and private would have been subject to the same\r\nlimitation. Besides, Monroe held that the restrictive words\r\nimmediately following \"artillery and other public property\" was not\r\nintended to include the words \"slaves and other private property.\" If\r\n\"the slaves and other private property\" are placed on the same footing\r\nwith artillery and other public property, \"the consequences must be\r\nthat all will be carried away.\"\r\n\r\nMonroe learned, furthermore, that Mr. Baker, Charge D'affaires of\r\nGreat Britain, had placed another construction on Article I of the\r\ntreaty. In this new construction he had made a distinction between\r\nslaves who were in British ships of war in American waters and those\r\nin the ports held by British forces at the time of the exchange of\r\nratifications.[68] Monroe and the commissioners, on the other hand,\r\nwere of the opinion that the United States was entitled to all slaves\r\nin possession of the British forces within the limits of the United\r\nStates forts or British ships of war. Concerning this opinion Baker\r\nwrote April 3, 1815, that it could not be shown that Monroe's\r\nconstruction was sanctioned by the words of the Article. \"If this\r\nconstruction had been known then,\" he remarked, \"we would have\r\ndecidedly objected to it and proposed others.\"[69]\r\n\r\nAccessible reports indicate that the governments of Great Britain and\r\nthe United States persisted in the constructions given by their\r\nrespective representatives. Clavelle, the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nBritish forces in the Chesapeake, claimed that the treaty meant only\r\nsuch slaves or other private property should be delivered up as were\r\n\"originally captured in the forts or places to be restored.\" In\r\nconformity with their construction of the Article, Clavelle refused\r\nfurthermore to restore the slaves taken from Tangier Islands, because\r\nthey were not originally captured there. The United States, on the\r\nother hand, was of the opinion that the country was entitled to all\r\nslaves within its limits on the exchange of the ratifications of the\r\ntreaty. The United States believed, finally, that the carrying away of\r\nNegroes applied to both kinds of property because the word was common\r\nto both descriptions.\r\n\r\nBy the usage of civilized nations in cases of invasion private\r\nproperty with the exception of maritime captures was respected. This\r\nmeant, in effect, that none could be lawfully taken away. Influenced\r\nby this usage Great Britain receded from her position and declared\r\nthat the claim of the United States to indemnification for her\r\nslaves--had never been resisted. In the meantime Great Britain\r\ndeclared April 10, 1816, that she could not consider any property\r\nwhich had been previous to ratification of the treaty removed on\r\nshipboard as \"property forming a subject for a claim of restoration or\r\nindemnification.\" In spirit, these two declarations were\r\ncontradictory. Besides they made the subject more difficult and\r\npuzzling.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the work of the commissioners continued. In their\r\nefforts to take an inventory of the slaves so that the claims might be\r\nadjusted, they encountered the opposition of Clavelle and Cockburn. It\r\nwas clearly evident that the efforts of the commissioners would be of\r\nno avail. More coercive means were necessary to settle such an\r\nextended and controversial question. In a convention of commerce\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States October 20, 1818,\r\nrepresentatives realized that an agreement in regard to the Negroes\r\nwas hardly possible. The representatives from the United States,\r\ntherefore, offered to refer the differences to some friendly sovereign\r\nor State to be named for that purpose. They agreed further to consider\r\nthe decision of such a friendly sovereign or State to be \"final and\r\nconclusive.\"[70]\r\n\r\nVery soon thereafter the Emperor of Russia offered to use his good\r\noffices as mediator and after a short discussion, his proposal was\r\naccepted. To this end there was concluded on June 30, 1822, a\r\nconvention in which the adjustment of the claims for indemnity was\r\nleft to a mixed commission. This action was followed by desultory and\r\nextended discussions which terminated, nevertheless, in the final\r\ndisposition of the controversy. The point of difference was decided in\r\nfavor of the United States. In handing down his decision the Emperor\r\nheld that the limitations as to the restitution of public property\r\nbore no relation to private property. In effect, he said that the\r\ntreaty prohibited the carrying away of any private property whatever\r\nfrom the places and territories stipulated in Article I of the Treaty\r\nof Ghent. He contended that \"the United States was entitled to\r\nconsider as having been carried away all slaves who had been\r\ntransported from those territories on board of English vessels within\r\nthe waters of American territories and who for that reason had not\r\nbeen restored.\"[71]\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the decision of the Emperor of Russia a mixed\r\ncommission, one commissioner and one arbitrator from Great Britain as\r\nwell as the United States met July 30, 1822, at Washington, D.C.,\r\nunder the Emperor's mediation.[72] For the United States Langdon\r\nCheves was the commissioner and Henry Sewell the arbitrator; for Great\r\nBritain George Jackson was the commissioner and John McTavish the\r\narbitrator. George Hay was appointed, also, by the President of the\r\nUnited States to give such information and support that might be\r\nneeded since individual claimants could not be present. The purpose of\r\nthe commission was to prove the average value of the Negroes at the\r\ntime of the ratification of the treaty and to determine the validity\r\nof individual claims. In the event no agreement could be reached\r\nrecourse was had to the Emperor of Russia whose decision would be\r\n\"final and conclusive.\" This action was insisted upon by America,\r\nwhereas Great Britain persisted in refusing to submit such matters to\r\nthe Emperor. Their progress, as a result, was not very marked. In\r\nconsidering the \"definitive lists\"[73] of claims these commissioners\r\nencountered many more doubtful and intricate problems. Claims not\r\ncontained in this list were not to be taken cognizance of; nor was the\r\nBritish government required to make compensation for them. With\r\nrespect to compensation, Great Britain promised to produce all\r\nevidence which was in the possession of her naval and military\r\nofficers concerning the number of slaves carried away. It was provided\r\nby the commission that no payment was to be made within twelve months.\r\nSeptember 11, 1822, the board unanimously agreed on the average value\r\nof slaves as follows:\r\n\r\n  Each slave from Louisiana                            $580\r\n  Each slave from Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama      390\r\n  Each slave from Maryland, Virginia and other States   280\r\n\r\nThe next difficulty of the board occurred in regard to the allowance\r\nof interest on claims. Concerning this point, Cheves held that a\r\nreasonable compensation for the injury sustained should have been\r\ngranted. \"A just compensation,\" said Cheves, \"is the reestablishment\r\nof the thing taken away with an equivalent for the use of it during\r\nthe period of detention.\" In reply to this Jackson held that the\r\nconvention of 1822 did not grant the commissioners the power to fix\r\ninterests and, besides, that interests not being a part of the debt\r\ncould not be allowed. Realizing the futility of his claims Cheves\r\noffered to submit the difference to arbitration, but Jackson declined.\r\n\r\nEqually difficult questions arose in regard to the slaves taken away\r\nfrom Dauphin Island in Mobile Bay.[74] This island, controlled by the\r\nBritish during the war, was later surrendered to the United States.\r\nConcerning this Jackson held that it was not legally at the time of\r\nthe ratifications of the treaty a part of the United States, that is,\r\nit was not a part of Louisiana but belonged to West Florida, which was\r\nnot ceded to the United States until 1819.[75] In regard to this\r\nCheves offered to refer these claims to arbitration, but in this view\r\nJackson refused to acquiesce. The situation did not become any better\r\neven when Rufus King was sent as our minister to England to succeed\r\nHenry Clay who became John Quincy Adams's Secretary of State.\r\n\r\nContinued disagreement of the representatives of Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States resulted. Their failure to agree upon the provisions of\r\nthe Convention of 1822--that matters under dispute be referred to\r\narbitration made the work of this convention of little avail. Clay's\r\noffer of settlement was not favorably received in Great Britain. As to\r\na basis of compromise, Clay said that the \"total number of slaves on\r\nthe definitive list was 3,601; that the entire value of all the\r\nproperty for which the indemnity was claimed including interest might\r\nbe stated at $2,693,120.\" Realizing that this large sum would never be\r\nsecured, Clay suggested that $1,151,800 might be used as the minimum\r\nin the negotiation. He used as a guide the fact that Parliament had\r\nappropriated 250,000 pounds to cover the awards of the commission.\r\nThis sum, Mr. King observed also, was nearly the sum mentioned as a\r\nminimum by Clay in his instructions to him. Even with this\r\ninformation, the commissioners made little progress.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Mr. Vaughan, the British Envoy at Washington, said\r\nApril 12, 1826, \"that His Majesty's Government regretted to find\r\nthemselves under the absolute impossibility of accepting the terms of\r\ncompromise offered by the envoy from the United States in London.\" He\r\ndid not admit, moreover, that the question of interest should be\r\nreferred to arbitration, but maintained that the demand was\r\nunwarranted by the convention and unfounded by the Law Officers of the\r\nCrown.[76] In reply to his observation, Clay informed Vaughan of the\r\nfact that Great Britain's representatives had refused to refer many\r\nquestions to arbitration and that if this refusal to cooperate in this\r\nregard should be upheld it would virtually be making him the final\r\njudge of every question of difference that arose in the joint\r\ncommission.[77] This disagreement continued until 1825, when the\r\ncommissioners met to collect and weigh evidence.\r\n\r\nSoon thereafter, Albert Gallatin, who had been appointed Envoy of the\r\nUnited States to London, was authorized to treat with Canning on the\r\noft-discussed question. During the first interview he discovered that,\r\nwhile there was a great reluctance to recede from the ground already\r\ntaken by Jackson, there was also a disposition to settle that\r\ncontroversy.[78] Following the instructions given to King, Gallatin\r\nused the 250,000 pounds as the basis of settlement. This sum he was\r\nauthorized to accept. He, however, did not make this offer known\r\nimmediately but waited for the formal offer of $1,200,000 from the\r\nBritish Government; and in conformity with his instruction of a later\r\ndate, Gallatin offered as an ultimatum an acceptance of $1,204,960,\r\nwhich the British Government reluctantly agreed to pay.[79]\r\n\r\nOn November 13, 1826, a convention to carry out this agreement was\r\nconcluded. The amount specified above was to cover all claims under\r\nthe award of the Emperor of Russia. It provided, moreover, that the\r\nmoney was to be paid in Washington, in the current money of the United\r\nStates, in two installments; the first twenty days after the British\r\nMinister in the United States should have been officially notified of\r\nthe ratifications of the convention, and the second August 1, 1827. In\r\nthis way the convention of 1822 was annulled, save as to the two\r\narticles relating to the average value of slaves which had been\r\ncarried into effect, and as to the third article as related to the\r\ndefinitive list which had also been carried out.[80] This ended the\r\nwork of the board. After ratification had been exchanged the board\r\nadjourned, March 26, 1827.\r\n\r\nThis left one more matter to be disposed of, that of executing the\r\nprovisions of the commission of 1826. In compliance with this Congress\r\npassed an act, March 2, 1827, to carry out this agreement.[81] A\r\nconvention was thereby called to meet in Washington July 10th and\r\nproceed with the consideration of claims, \"allowing such further time\r\nfor the production of evidence as they should think just.\" As soon as\r\nthe claims were validated and the principal amounts ascertained\r\nseventy-five per cent of the principal was paid with the explanation\r\nthat when all claims were settled, the other twenty-five per cent\r\nwould be paid, if the fund permitted it. If it did not, then the\r\nremainder would be distributed in proportion to the sums awarded. In\r\nthese negotiations, Langdon Cheves and Henry Sewell, who had only\r\nrecently represented the United States in London, together with James\r\nPleasants of Virginia, were appointed commissioners. They considered\r\nnot only the claims on the definitive list but also those deposited in\r\nthe Department of State and which had not been previously adjusted.\r\n\r\nThe conflicting interests of payments and the inconclusive evidence\r\nwhich were presented made the work of this convention more difficult.\r\nThe records were very poor and contained little of the information\r\ndesired. For this reason many claims were denied; especially was this\r\ntrue in Maryland and Virginia.[82] Many of the claimants of other\r\nStates nevertheless were compensated. Seventy-five per cent was\r\ngranted them, the sum totalling $600,000 being paid. This condition of\r\naffairs caused a clash among the 1,100 claimants, 700 of whose\r\npetitions on the definitive list were examined. Many other claimants\r\nwere seeking evidence to secure compensation. They were not\r\nsuccessful, however, for Cheves opposed the admission of hearsay\r\ntestimony as well as the testimony of slaves. Well informed as to the\r\nprogress of the commission, Congress passed an act May 15, 1828,[83]\r\nspecifying August 31st as the last day on which the commission would\r\nmeet. Of that entire amount awarded $1,197,422.18 had been paid to the\r\nclaimants. The remaining sum was \"distributed and paid ratably,\" to\r\nall the claimants to whom compensation had been made. The work of the\r\nConvention of 1827 thus ended.\r\n\r\n                                             ARNETT G.

Many northern men led by Sumner and Stevens, who at first\r\ntried to secure the cooperation of the best whites, became indignant\r\nbecause of this attitude of the South and were reduced to the\r\nnecessity of forcing Negro suffrage upon the South at the point of the\r\nbayonet, believing that the only way to insure the future welfare of\r\nthe Negro was to safeguard it by giving him the ballot. Under the\r\nprotection of these military governments, the Negroes and certain more\r\nor less fortunate whites gained political control. The southern white\r\nmen, weary and disgusted because of the outcome of their attempts at\r\nsecession, maintained an attitude of sullenness and indifference\r\ntoward the new regime and accordingly offered at first very little\r\nopposition to the Negro control of politics. The Negroes, upon their\r\nsecuring the right of suffrage, however, turned at once to their\r\nformer masters for political leadership,[2] but the majority of these\r\nsouthern gentlemen refused to \"lower their dignity\" by political\r\nassociation with the Negroes. The few southern gentlemen who did\r\naffiliate with the Negroes were dubbed \"scalawags\" by their former\r\nfriends and cast out of southern society.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes were then forced, because of the lack of cooperation on\r\nthe part of the southern whites, to accept the leadership of certain\r\nnorthern men who came South for the sole purpose of personal gain and\r\nexploitation. These men were in some cases of an extremely low order\r\nand were in a large measure responsible for the corruption of\r\nReconstruction days. They were contemptuously called \"carpetbaggers\"\r\nby the southern whites because they were so poor that they could carry\r\nall of their possessions in a carpet bag. Some of these white men were\r\nconscientious, however, and served these States honorably. Most\r\nNegroes, therefore, were under the leadership of these three elements:\r\nsouthern men who were regarded by their neighbors as men of the lowest\r\npossible order, unscrupulous adventurers from the North, and some\r\nintelligent members of their own race like B. K. Bruce, John R. Lynch,\r\nR. B. Elliot, and John M. Langston. This ill-assorted group of\r\npoliticians reconstructed the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of this policy has been widely questioned. From the point\r\nof view of most white men studying Reconstruction history this effort\r\nto make the Negro a factor in politics was a failure, the elimination\r\nof the Negro from politics was just, and the rise of the Negro to\r\npolitical power even today is viewed with alarm. The opinions of the\r\nbiased historians in this field will be interesting. Several writers\r\nrefer to the Negro carpet bag movement as an effort to found\r\ncommonwealths upon the votes of an ignorant Negro electorate, as\r\nworking an injustice both to the whites and the blacks in that it made\r\nthe South solidly democratic.[3] J. G. de R. Hamilton, exaggerating\r\nthe actual basis of Reconstruction in the southern commonwealths,\r\nwhich were never fully controlled by the Negroes, speaks of the work\r\nas having left as a legacy \"a protest against anything that might\r\nthreaten a repetition of the past, when selfish politicians, backed up\r\nby the Federal Government, for party purposes, attempted to Africanize\r\nthe State and deprive the people through misrule and oppression of\r\nmost that life held dear.\"[4] John W. Burgess calls the effort an\r\n\"extravagant humanitarianism which had developed in the minds of the\r\nReconstruction leaders to the point of justifying, not only the\r\npolitical equality of the races but the political superiority at least\r\nin loyalty to the Union, the constitution and republican government,\r\nof the uncivilized Negroes of the South.\"[5] Burgess sees justice in\r\nsubjecting the inferior to the superior class but none in subjecting\r\nthe superior to the inferior.\r\n\r\nOf these radical utterances historians need take but little notice.\r\nThey are of value here for the reason that they show the lack of\r\nscientific Reconstruction history. No intelligent man who lived\r\nthrough this stormy period or who has read documents bearing on its\r\nhistory will contend that these commonwealths were Africanized merely\r\nbecause the Negroes along with the formerly disfranchised and ignorant\r\npoor whites were given the right of suffrage. It will be difficult to\r\nprove that the majority of poor whites in the South were at this time\r\nsufficiently intelligent and experienced in statecraft to give those\r\ncommonwealths a much better government than that administered by the\r\nNegroes and \"Carpet baggers\"; for the South had been ruled by few\r\naristocratic families, most of whom because of participation in the\r\nCivil War, could not on the cessation of hostilities be given the\r\nreins of government. A few who had not had any such connection with\r\nthe Confederacy haughtily refused to cooperate with the Negroes in the\r\nreconstruction of these governments, although they were persistently\r\ninvited by the Negroes who were thus advised by Thaddeus Stevens and\r\nCharles Sumner, who showed foresight in trying to secure the\r\ncooperation of the best white element in the South.[6] These\r\nstatesmen, however, are generally slandered by uninformed writers who\r\ncontend that Sumner and Stevens did not thus proceed. The Negroes not\r\nonly sought the leadership of the whites but showed unusual humaneness\r\ntoward their poverty-stricken former masters by passing, as they did\r\nin South Carolina, stay laws to postpone the payment of their many war\r\ndebts secured by mortgages on their property.\r\n\r\nStatistics show, moreover, that with the exception of South Carolina\r\nand Mississippi, no State and not even any department of a State\r\ngovernment was ever dominated altogether by Negroes. The Negroes never\r\nwanted and never had complete control in the Southern States.[7] The\r\nmost important offices were generally held by white men. Only two\r\nNegroes ever served in the United States Senate, Hiram R. Revells and\r\nB. K. Bruce; and only twenty ever became Representatives in the House:\r\nand all of these did not serve at the same time, although some of them\r\nwere elected for more than one term.\r\n\r\nThe charge that the men who were elected to office by the Negroes were\r\nalways of the most debased and degenerate type is untrue. Because of\r\nthe refusal of the southern aristocracy to cooperate with them,\r\nhowever, the Negroes were forced to elect such men as they were able\r\nto secure. Numerous promising and respectable whites who were elected\r\nto office by the Negroes, became corrupt and unprincipled on account\r\nof the treatment tendered them by the aristocratic whites. From among\r\nthe Negroes themselves, the very best men available were chosen to\r\nhold offices. Among these were former slaves who had been made\r\ntrustworthy servants of their masters and free Negroes who had\r\nreceived some education. Some of these Negroes served in their\r\nofficial capacity with honor and credit. A number of them were also\r\nrespected by certain fairminded southern whites.[8]\r\n\r\nNumerous examples of the high regard which the whites of certain\r\ncommunities had for the Negro leaders can be cited. Samuel J. Lee, of\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, was considered by his white contemporaries\r\nas one of the best criminal lawyers which the State had produced. At\r\nhis death all local courts were declared adjourned and the entire city\r\npaid him homage. The late Bishop Isaac Clinton served, as Treasurer of\r\nOrangeburg, South Carolina, for eight years. Like Mr. Lee, he was held\r\nin high esteem by his white neighbors and upon the occasion of his\r\nfuneral, the business of the community was suspended as a mark of\r\nrespect to his memory. In certain communities, as in South Carolina,\r\nsome Negroes were retained as office holders for a number of years\r\nafter the supremacy of the Democratic party was assured. In\r\nGeorgetown, South Carolina, Mr. George Harriot was Superintendent of\r\nEducation for the county for years under the Democratic party.\r\nBeaufort, South Carolina, retained Negroes as sheriffs and school\r\nofficials until a few years ago.[9]\r\n\r\nJ. T. White, Commissioner of Public Works and Internal Improvements in\r\nthe State of Arkansas; M. W. Gibbs, Municipal judge in Little Rock,\r\nand J. C. Corbin, State Superintendent of Schools in the same State,\r\nhad records equally as creditable. The same may be said of F. L.\r\nCardoza, State Treasurer of South Carolina, Richard T. Greener, a\r\nprofessor in the University of that commonwealth, Oscar Dunn,\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Louisiana and P.B.S. Pinchback, Acting Governor\r\nof that State.[10] The record of Dubuclet, according to Dr. Woodson,\r\nshould receive special mention. In contradistinction to the rule of\r\nstealing from the public treasury, this man who served as Treasurer of\r\nthe State of Louisiana even after the other departments of the\r\ngovernment had been taken from the Negroes, in as much as the term of\r\nservice of the Treasurer was six years rather than four, was\r\ninvestigated with a view to finding out some act of misuse of the\r\npublic funds that he might be impeached and thrown out of office. The\r\ncommittee, of which E.D. White, now Chief Justice of the United States\r\nSupreme Court, was chairman, reported after much deliberation that\r\nDubuclet's funds had been honestly handled and that there were no\r\ngrounds on which proceedings against him could be instituted.[11]\r\n\r\nDespite the above mentioned instances of commendable Negro officials,\r\nhowever, the majority of the Negro functionaries were incompetent and\r\nas a result these governments could but collapse. The charge of\r\ncorruption laid at the door of the Negro carpetbagger governments is\r\nto a large extent true. The corruption resulted largely from the work\r\nof the interlopers from the North and the \"scalawags,\" using the\r\nNegroes to reach their own personal ends. In some of this corruption,\r\nhowever, the Negro was an apt scholar and freely participated. The\r\nNegroes were not as a whole prepared for the political privileges\r\nwhich were vouchsafed to them and they were to a large extent under\r\nthe wrong sort of leadership. It is equally true, however, that\r\ngovernments were corrupt throughout the United States at this period.\r\nThe Reconstruction period was one of corruption and if the Negro\r\ngovernments were of a lower order than a few others, they were not far\r\nout of accord with the times. The white people, who assumed control of\r\nthe government on overthrowing the Reconstruction regime, instituted\r\nin several States a rule of corruption surpassing even that of their\r\npredecessors. Coming back into office like hungry persons who had been\r\nexposed to the cold atmosphere of an exile, the radical whites filled\r\ntheir purses from the coffers of the public treasury and defaulted to\r\nthe amount of thousands of dollars which the tax payers have had to\r\nreplace in the years thereafter.[12] The disgraces of Reconstruction,\r\ntherefore, have been exaggeratingly flaunted by the South for the same\r\npurpose that it proclaims the widespread false charge of rape of the\r\npresent day to justify the persecution of the Negro for being\r\n\"unusually criminal.\"\r\n\r\nThe Negro was finally driven from southern politics through violence\r\nand fraud. The chief agent of the southern whites in accomplishing\r\nthis was a secret organization known as the Ku Klux Klan. This\r\norganized mob killed off or drove the leading \"Carpetbaggers\" out of\r\nthe South and intimidated the Negroes into submission by perpetrating\r\nnumerous outrages upon them. After the whites regained control of the\r\ngovernment, through their agents of terror the political ascendancy of\r\nthe Negro was at end. The unscrupulous northern friends of the Negro\r\nhaving discovered that they could no longer successfully exploit them,\r\ntherefore, abandoned them in the midst of their calamity. The whites\r\nproceeded to solidify the Democratic party and to eliminate the Negro\r\nentirely from politics in the South.\r\n\r\nPolitically, however, Reconstruction was in several respects a\r\nsuccess. In the first place, the reconstructed governments were\r\ndemocratic, lifting a standard that the backward commonwealths of the\r\nSouth must still struggle for years to reach. In this social upheaval\r\nthe poor white man was politically emancipated by receiving the boon\r\nof suffrage theretofore restricted to persons owning property and\r\ngiven a free and open door to office holding, which, under the old\r\nregime had been restricted to the few aristocrats dominating the\r\ncountry and State governments. These Negroes gave the South its\r\nimproved judicial system and did their work so well in framing some of\r\nthe constitutions that many of them with the exception of the clauses\r\nantagonistic to the Negro remained about as they were for many years.\r\nAlthough the Democrats got control of the State in 1877, the\r\nconstitution of South Carolina of 1868 was not changed materially\r\nuntil 1893.\r\n\r\nThe Negro as a factor in reconstruction, moreover, instituted\r\neducation at the expense of the public. Through the establishment of\r\npublic schools with well equipped buildings and prepared teachers they\r\nremoved from that system the stigma formerly attached to persons[13]\r\neducating their children at public expense. They, therefore, made of\r\neducation a foundation upon which real democracy must build. It is\r\nonly short sightedness on the part of writers to infer that because\r\nthe Negro was in a few years thereafter deprived of the ballot that\r\nthe good work which was done during the years that they were permitted\r\nto participate in the affairs of these States could be so easily\r\noverthrown, especially so when this progressive part of the program of\r\nthe reconstructed governments which the restored whites at first\r\nabandoned has later been taken up and carried out.\r\n\r\nAlthough weakened by the reaction of the North against the methods\r\nemployed by politicians in maintaining the reconstructed governments\r\nat the South, which moved President Hayes to withdraw the troops from\r\nthat area, the Negroes were still of some concern to the Republicans.\r\nTo retain their support the Republicans often spoke of foisting upon\r\nthe South the Force Bill to guarantee fair elections but rather\r\nabandoned the Negro to the fate of working out his own salvation with\r\nhis oppressors. In all of the campaigns up to 1888 there was the usual\r\nwaving of the \"bloody shirt\" to array the Negro against the South and\r\nof urging the Negro to vote the Republican ticket to pay the debt he\r\nowed the party for his freedom, hypocritically threatening also to\r\nundo many of the things which had been done to the Negro since\r\nReconstruction. There was no sincerity in these vote-getting\r\ndeclarations, however, and the Negro in the South remained politically\r\ndoomed.\r\n\r\nNothing will better bring out this treatment of the Negro by the\r\nRepublican party than a study of the consideration given the race in\r\nthe various platforms of that party following the Civil war. The\r\nRepublicans in the convention of 1868 declared themselves in sympathy\r\nwith all oppressed peoples struggling for their rights and recognized\r\nthe principles laid down in the Declaration of Independence as a true\r\nfoundation of democratic government. That same year, however, the\r\nDemocratic party recognized the question of slavery and secession as\r\nhaving been settled but denounced Negro supremacy.[14]\r\n\r\nIn 1872 the platform of the Republican party was somewhat more\r\noutspoken. It carried a reference to the suppression of the rebellion,\r\nthe emancipation of four million slaves, the grant of equal\r\ncitizenship and the establishment of universal suffrage. It said,\r\nmoreover, that \"neither law nor its administration should attempt any\r\ndiscrimination in respect to citizens by reason of race, creed, color,\r\nor previous condition of servitude.[15] The Liberal Republicans,\r\nrallying in a different quarter that year, declared in their platform\r\ntheir belief in the equality of all men before the law and the duty of\r\nthe government in all its dealings with the people to mete out equal\r\nand exact justice to all of whatever nativity, race, color or\r\npersuasion, religious or political. The Liberal Republicans pledged\r\nthemselves to maintain the union of States, emancipation, and\r\nenfranchisement and to oppose any reopening of the questions settled\r\nby the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of the\r\nConstitution. They advocated the removal of the disabilities of\r\nConfederates, the establishment of civil government at the South,\r\nuniversal amnesty, and impartial suffrage.[16]\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the Negro was given further mention by the various parties.\r\nThe Prohibitionists took the lead in the declaration for equal\r\nsuffrage and eligibility to office without distinction of race,\r\nreligious creed, property or sex.[17] The Republicans referred in\r\ntheir platform to the permanent restoration of the southern section to\r\nthe Union and the complete protection of all citizens in the free\r\nenjoyment of all their rights as an issue to which the Republican\r\nparty stood sacredly pledged. \"The power to provide for the\r\nenforcement of the principles embodied by the recent constitutional\r\namendments,\" continues the platform, \"is vested by those amendments in\r\nthe Congress of the United States, and we declare it to be a solemn\r\nobligation of the legislative and executive departments of government\r\nto put into immediate and vigorous exercise all their constitutional\r\npowers for removing any just cause of discontent on the part of any\r\nclass, and for securing to every American citizen complete liberty and\r\nexact equality in the exercise of all civil, political, and public\r\nrights. To this end we imperatively demand a congress and a chief\r\nexecutive whose courage and fidelity to these duties are placed beyond\r\ndispute or recall.\"[18]\r\n\r\nThe National Democratic platform of that year, however, spoke for the\r\ndemocracy of the whole country and declared its faith in the\r\npermanence of the Federal Union, and devotion to the Constitution of\r\nthe United States with its amendments universally accepted as a final\r\nsettlement of the controversies that engendered the Civil War; but\r\ntook a bold stand for reform as necessary to rebuild and establish in\r\nthe hearts of the whole people of the Union eleven years ago happily\r\nrescued from the danger of a secession of States but now to be severed\r\nfrom a corrupt centralism which after inflicting upon ten States the\r\nrapacity of carpet bag tyrannies, had \"honey-combed the offices of the\r\nFederal government itself with the contagion of misrule and locked\r\nfast the prosperity of an industrious people in the paralysis of hard\r\ntimes.\"[19]\r\n\r\nIn 1880 The Republican party made no particular mention of the\r\ngrievances of the Negroes but recited its record in suppressing the\r\nrebellion, reconstructing the Union with freedom instead of slavery as\r\nits corner stone, the transformation of four million human beings from\r\nthe likeness of things to the rank of citizens and removing Congress\r\nfrom the infamous work of hunting fugitive slaves and charging it to\r\nsee that slavery shall not exist. It declared, moreover, that the\r\nSouth must be divided by the peaceful agencies of the ballot that all\r\nopinions might there find free expression and to this end the honest\r\nvoter must be protected against terrorism, violence or fraud.[20]\r\n\r\nIn 1884 there was no specific reference to the Negro unless it be\r\nfound in the statement that the Republican party had gained its\r\nstrength by \"quick and faithful response to the demands of the people\r\nfor the freedom and equality of all men; for a united nation, assuring\r\nthe rights of all citizens.\"[21] The platform of the Democratic party\r\ncarried a declaration equally as emphatic in that it said, \"the\r\npreservation of personal rights; the equality of all citizens before\r\nthe law; the reserved rights of the States and the supremacy of the\r\nFederal government within the limits of the constitution will ever\r\nform the true basis of our liberties.\" It further said; \"Asserting the\r\nequality of all men before the law, we hold that it is the duty of the\r\ngovernment, in its dealings with the people, to mete out equal and\r\nexact justice to all citizens, of whatever nativity, race, color, or\r\npersuasion, religious or political.\"[22]\r\n\r\nGiving some impetus to the movement for woman suffrage which the\r\nRepublicans had by various platforms theretofore encouraged, the\r\nProhibitionists carried in their platform in 1888 the declaration that\r\nthe right of suffrage rests on no mere circumstance of race, color,\r\nsex or nationality and that \"where, from any cause, it has been held\r\nfrom citizens who are of suitable age and mentally and morally\r\nqualified for the exercise of an intelligent ballot, it should be\r\nrestored by the people through the legislature of the several States,\r\non such basis as they may deem wise.[23]\r\n\r\nTo protect the Negroes in their political rights, however, the Federal\r\nGovernment as administered by the Republican party during these years\r\nfurnished little encouragement, through its much talked of enforcement\r\nof the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Bills providing for\r\nadequate military protection of the Negroes at the polls were enacted\r\nbut the Supreme Court of the United States declared that the Federal\r\nGovernment did not possess the authority to restrain mobs from\r\ninterfering with elections. The Supreme Court conceded that the\r\nFifteenth Amendment forbade the denial of the right to vote by any\r\nState on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\r\nbut easily conceded that no violation of this amendment could occur\r\nwhen a hostile mob excluded Negroes from the polls. Yet although the\r\nmob thus quickly triumphed in undoing the democratic reforms of\r\nReconstruction, the South hoped thereafter to reach the same end by\r\nimposing on the Negroes a legal disability; for the Fifteenth\r\nAmendment did not assert the right of the Negro to vote. It merely\r\nsaid that suffrage could not be denied on account of race, color, or\r\nprevious condition of servitude. As the Negro was generally poor and\r\nin the midst of the economic depression of the South too often had to\r\nwander from place to place to seek a livelihood, he could be easily\r\neliminated by the poll tax, the resident requirement, and educational\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nThus it happened. Mississippi under its new constitution in 1890\r\neliminated the Negro and in the next twenty years all of the cotton\r\nStates except Florida and Texas followed its example. Arkansas based\r\nthe franchise on a one year poll tax in 1893; South Carolina required\r\nresidence, enrollment, and poll tax in 1895; Delaware adopted an\r\neducational test in 1897, Louisiana resorted to the same test and poll\r\ntax in 1898 and North Carolina fell in line in 1900. Alabama\r\nestablished the residence, registry and poll tax requirement in 1901;\r\nand Virginia, Georgia and Oklahoma based suffrage on property,\r\nliteracy or poll tax in 1902, 1908, and 1910 respectively. As these\r\nmeasures bore heavily also upon certain ignorant whites they were\r\nrelieved of this disability by the \"Grandfather Clause\" specifying\r\nthat the persons deprived by these regulations of the right to vote\r\nmight be placed upon the roll of voters if they had exercised this\r\nprivilege before the year 1867 or were descended from such voters.\r\nThis was essentially the clause adopted in North Carolina, Alabama,\r\nVirginia, and Georgia.[24] The Supreme Court, however, has declared\r\nthe \"Grandfather Clause\" a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaigns after 1888 the Republican party made no special\r\nmention of the Negro as it had formerly and did not show any\r\ninclination to shoulder the grievances of the race. At this time the\r\nRepublicans were face to face with a large element of political\r\nreformers led by the Democrats who, prior to the campaign of 1884 had\r\ncarried Pennsylvania and New York and made such other inroads in\r\nnorthern strongholds as to convince the leaders of the Republican\r\nparty that the Negro issue and the \"bloody shirt\" would no longer\r\nsuffice to hold those voters who had been won by the intelligent\r\nappeal for deliverance from the corrupt practices in the local and\r\nnational governments. This movement culminated in the election of\r\nGrover Cleveland in 1884 and in his election the second time in 1892.\r\n\r\nTo attach Negroes to their cause, to be sure, the Republicans were\r\nvery deferential to them in the national conventions, where they were\r\nof much service in naming candidates for the national ticket although\r\nthey could not vote in the South and were not sufficiently numerous in\r\nthe North to be a large factor at the polls. At the convention in\r\n1884, the national committee had named ex-Senator Powell Clayton of\r\nArkansas as temporary chairman of the convention, an arrangement which\r\nwas supposed to be in the interest of Mr. Blaine. The young men of\r\nthe party led by Henry Cabot Lodge and Theodore Roosevelt effected the\r\nnomination from the floor of John R. Lynch, a distinguished man of\r\ncolor of Mississippi, and the vote by delegates elected him to the\r\nposition by 431 to 387 given to Mr. Clayton.[25] Frederick Douglass\r\nreceived one vote for the nomination for President in 1888.[26]\r\n\r\nAfter the complete undoing of the Reconstruction the Negroes were at a\r\nloss politically. A number of the foremost Negro politicians, among\r\nwhom were Frederick Douglass, John R. Lynch, B. K. Bruce, John M.\r\nLangston, John C. Dancy, and a few others, were given positions in the\r\nservice of the Federal Government of high sounding titles and little\r\nimportance, such as Registrar of the Treasury, Recorder of Deeds,\r\nAuditor of the Navy and diplomatic posts in Negro countries. A greater\r\nnumber of Negroes found an outlet in the civil service. Even up until\r\nthe present day it is an ardent desire of the Negro to obtain a civil\r\nservice appointment. In these positions the Negroes were able to earn\r\na comparatively easy living but were not able to do anything\r\nconstructive for the uplift of their people.\r\n\r\nThe Negroes, however, had continued to support the Republican party to\r\nthe full extent of their strength. But it soon became clear that the\r\nsupport of Negro leaders was little more than an effort directed\r\ntoward obtaining a few unimportant offices. The Republicans, having\r\nlong since discovered that the Negro vote of most communities can be\r\nchanged neither to harm nor to help them, have consequently ceased to\r\nconsider the danger of losing their support of great import. The\r\nDemocratic party, moreover, has continued almost unswervingly its\r\nattitude of aloofness from the Negro. The onesidedness of the Negro\r\nvote has been declared by some Negroes to be the cause of its\r\nnon-importance. With this political view some few of them have allied\r\nthemselves with the Democratic party, feeling that the division of the\r\nNegro's vote may work an improvement in his political status. Because\r\nof ex-President Taft's attitude of indifference toward the Negroes a\r\nnumber of the Negro politicians supported Roosevelt's party in 1912\r\nand many voted for Wilson in 1916.\r\n\r\nWith the Negro in this weak position, however, there developed in the\r\nSouth a movement to remove from the Republican party the stigma of its\r\nconnection with the Negro by eliminating the members of that race from\r\nthe circles of control in the South. This movement has been generally\r\nknown as a \"Lily-Whiteism.\" For the last twenty-five years, therefore,\r\nthere have come to the National Republican Conventions from the\r\nvarious Southern States contesting delegations, one white and the\r\nother black, each one claiming to be the properly accredited\r\nrepresentative of the Republican party in the State concerned. In some\r\nStates the \"Lily-Whites\" have actually held conventions from which the\r\nNegroes were excluded or which they were not permitted to attend.\r\nBecause of the difficulty of making good their claim as properly\r\naccredited delegates they have abandoned this method for the\r\nsubterfuge of holding their conventions in hotels or other exclusive\r\nplaces which Negroes, because of the social proscription of the race,\r\nare prohibited from entering by an already well established unwritten\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the Republican party in such commonwealths no\r\nlonger exists and these delegates whether white or black represent\r\nmerely rotten boroughs. As they are of use, however, in selecting the\r\ncandidate to be nominated for president, the administration has been\r\nvery reluctant to interfere with the proposed reform in these quarters\r\nfor the reason that such delegates are usually made up of persons\r\nappointed by the President of the United States to Federal positions\r\nin the South. As the President usually desires to be reelected and can\r\ncontrol such a coterie, it has been very difficult to find one with\r\nthe courage to give his influence in the direction of reform.\r\n\r\nEarly in the winter of the year when the president is to be nominated,\r\npersons supporting the administration usually visit the South laying\r\nplans for lining up these prospective delegates. Politicians\r\ninterested in other candidates make similar tours through the South\r\nsometimes lavishly handling funds to the extent of buying up\r\ndelegates. As the whites are in a much better position to secure the\r\nfew Federal appointments allotted in the South, after the election,\r\nsince the abandonment of the policy of appointing Negroes to these\r\npositions, the Negroes have usually exacted a much larger compensation\r\nfor their services in the pre-convention struggle than whites have\r\nrequired, thus shamelessly disgracing themselves in the eyes of those\r\nwho would expect the leaders of the race to play a more honorable\r\nrole.\r\n\r\nThere are in certain sections of the South a number of men who devote\r\nall of their time to electing these delegates for service in these\r\nconventions and secure therefore adequate remuneration for a\r\nlivelihood from administration to administration. The pliant Negro\r\ndelegates at the convention in Chicago in 1908 and 1912 were unequal\r\nto the task of nominating a progressive candidate because of their\r\nmachine like attachment to the candidacy of William Howard Taft, whom\r\nthe American people would not accept. The Negro delegates, however,\r\ndid much better in the convention of 1916 and still further improved\r\nby the time of the conventions of 1920, when it was impossible for any\r\npre-convention arrangement or plan to be so carried out that any\r\ncandidate could come to the convention saying that he had the Negroes\r\nto vote in any particular way. It is encouraging, moreover, to add\r\nthat numbers of these delegates had received no funds from any quarter\r\nwhatever, but along with white men promoting their party had\r\ncontributed to the campaign funds and had paid their own expenses to\r\nthe convention. They were, therefore, given a more dignified position\r\nin the management of the party affairs and were in many respects shown\r\nthe same consideration as that given the white delegates, serving on\r\nvarious important committees and placed in strategic positions in the\r\nmanagement of the campaign without regard to color.\r\n\r\nIn drawing to a close this discussion of the Negro in politics I wish\r\nto accentuate the fact that while the Negro is at present practically\r\na political nonentity, he is yet potent, as is illustrated in various\r\nparts of the country. For example, at present there are two Negro\r\ncouncilmen in Chicago, two aldermen in New York, one assemblyman in\r\nNew York, two councilmen in Baltimore, three Negro members in the West\r\nVirginia legislature, one in the California legislature, and one in\r\nthe Indiana legislature. In several of the cities of the North there\r\nis such a large Negro population and so much appreciation among the\r\nNegroes of their political power that they are now launching a\r\nmovement to nominate and elect members of their race to represent them\r\nin Congress. It is likely that this may soon be effected in Chicago,\r\nNew York, and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n                                             NORMAN P.

Negroes who fled\r\nto Canada were given considerable material aid by the government of\r\nCanada and treated with sympathy by its people. Their own leaders,\r\nhowever, played no small part in the progress that they made in the\r\nBritish provinces and the names of Josiah Henson, Martin R. Delany and\r\nHenry Bibb stand for intelligence, energy and high qualities of\r\nservice on behalf of the race in Canada.\r\n\r\nHenry Bibb, born in slavery and without more than the barest rudiments\r\nof education, became prominent in the anti-slavery crusade, was\r\nactively associated with the Liberty Party in the State of Michigan\r\nduring the forties and when the Fugitive Slave Bill of 1850 drove\r\nthousands of his people out of the North and into Canada he set\r\nhimself vigorously to the task of settling them on the land, providing\r\nschools and churches, and through his paper, _The Voice of the\r\nFugitive_, exercised a good influence upon them at a time when their\r\nminds might be expected to be unsettled. Garrison and others who were\r\nactive in the anti-slavery movement paid tribute to his services in\r\nthat cause.\r\n\r\nBibb's career in slavery is told in his narrative published in New\r\nYork in 1849.[2] He was born in Shelby county, Kentucky, in May,\r\n1815, the son of a slave mother and a white father, and his childhood\r\nhe sums up by saying that he was \"educated in the school of adversity,\r\nwhips and chains.\" Of his early life he writes:\r\n\r\n     \"I was a wretched slave, compelled to work under the lash without\r\n     wages and often without clothes enough to hide my nakedness. I\r\n     have often worked without half enough to eat, both late and\r\n     early, by day and by night. I have often laid my wearied limbs\r\n     down at night to rest upon a dirt floor, or a bench without any\r\n     covering at all, because I had nowhere else to rest my wearied\r\n     body, after having worked hard all the day. I have been compelled\r\n     in early life to go at the bidding of a tyrant through all kinds\r\n     of weather, hot and cold, wet or dry, and without shoes\r\n     frequently until the month of December, with my bare feet on the\r\n     cold frosty ground, cracked open and bleeding as I walked.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the slaveholder's standpoint he was a most unsatisfactory\r\nservant, being an incorrigible runaway, a blemish on his moral\r\ncharacter which probably accounted for the frequency with which he\r\nchanged owners, six separate sales being recorded at prices ranging\r\nfrom $850 to $1200. The plantation punishments had no effect upon him\r\nsave to increase his desire for freedom.\r\n\r\nAs with many another slave the very evils of the system served a\r\npurpose in Bibb's life. Denied education of a normal kind he became\r\nobservant and his mind was enlightened by what he saw and heard.\r\n\"Among other good trades,\" he says, \"I learned the art of running away\r\nto perfection. I made a regular business of it and never gave it up\r\nuntil I had broken the bonds of slavery and landed myself in Canada\r\nwhere I was regarded as a man and not a thing.\"\r\n\r\nIll treatment was the incentive to the first attempt of Bibb to secure\r\nhis freedom. This was in 1835 and the next few years were occupied\r\nwith repeated unsuccessful efforts to get away and to take his wife\r\nand child with him. He had heard of Canada and his thoughts ever\r\nturned in that direction. On several occasions his flights led him as\r\nfar as the Ohio River, the boundary of freedom, but some force seemed\r\nalways at hand to drag him back. At the end of 1837 he managed to\r\nreach Cincinnati and spent that winter at Perrysburg with a community\r\nof Negroes settled there. The next summer he risked his freedom in\r\nattempting to bring his wife North, was captured, lodged in jail at\r\nLouisville, and managed to escape within a few hours after being\r\nlocked up. A year later he renewed the attempt, was again captured,\r\nand this time was sold, together with his wife, to a trader who dealt\r\nin the New Orleans market. It was in the fall of 1839 that the man and\r\nwife were exposed for sale in a slave yard on St. Joseph Street and in\r\nthe narrative there is an interesting account of the trade in this\r\nsouthern city. Newly arrived blacks were taken before a city official\r\nwho inspected their backs to see if they were scarred and also\r\nexamined their limbs to see if they were sound. To determine their age\r\nthe teeth were examined and the skin pinched on the back of the hand.\r\nIn the case of old slaves the pucker would remain for some seconds.\r\nThere was also rigorous examination as to mental capacity. Slaves who\r\ndisplayed unusual intelligence, who could read or write or who had\r\nbeen to Canada were not wanted. Bibb notes that practically every\r\nbuyer asked him if he could read or write and if he had ever run away.\r\nOf the slave yard itself he writes:\r\n\r\n     \"All classes of slaves were kept there for sale, to be sold in\r\n     private or public--young or old, males or females, children or\r\n     parents, husbands or wives. Every day, at ten o'clock, they were\r\n     exposed for sale. They had to be in trim for showing themselves\r\n     to the public for sale. Everyone's head had to be combed and\r\n     their faces washed, and those who were inclined to look dark and\r\n     rough were compelled to wash in greasy dish water in order to\r\n     make them look slick and lively. When spectators would come in\r\n     the yard the slaves were ordered out to form a line. They were\r\n     made to stand up straight and look as sprightly as they could;\r\n     and when they were asked a question they had to answer it as\r\n     promptly as they could, and try to induce the spectator to buy\r\n     them. If they failed to do this they were severely paddled after\r\n     the spectators were gone. The object for using the paddle in the\r\n     place of a lash was to conceal the marks which would be made by a\r\n     flogging. And the object for flogging under such circumstances is\r\n     to make the slave anxious to be sold.\"[3]\r\n\r\nThe Bibbs were eventually sold to a Red River planter with whom they\r\nhad a most miserable existence. For attending without leave a\r\nreligious meeting on a neighboring plantation Bibb was ordered to\r\nreceive five hundred lashes. To avoid this he took his wife and child\r\nand they hid in a swamp. Dogs tracked them down and every slave on the\r\nplantation witnessed the punishment that was given. Shortly afterwards\r\nthe planter sold Bibb to a party of southern sportsmen but refused to\r\nsell the wife whom Bibb never saw again. The new owners quickly resold\r\nhim to an Indian from whom he managed to escape and successfully made\r\nhis way through the Indian Territory, Missouri and Ohio to Michigan\r\nand Detroit.[4] He was never in the South again.\r\n\r\nBibb's arrival in Detroit came at what proved for him a most opportune\r\ntime, since it gave scope for his abilities to be utilized in the\r\nanti-slavery cause, particularly in the State of Michigan. The Detroit\r\nAnti-Slavery Society had been formed in 1837 and by the end of 1840\r\nthere were similar societies all over the State. Michigan, at this\r\ntime, was probably better organized and more united in sentiment than\r\nany other of the Northwestern States. It was the era of the Liberty\r\nParty whose platform \"asserted the overmastering importance of the one\r\nquestion of the existence of slavery, and the necessity of bringing\r\nabout a separation of the national government from all connection with\r\nthe institution.\" This third party was facing in 1844 a crisis over\r\nthe question of the annexation of Texas for which the South was a unit\r\nand on which the political organizations of the North were divided.\r\nBibb had attended a convention of free colored people held in Detroit\r\nin 1843 and the next year he began to give addresses throughout the\r\nState in the interests of Liberty Party candidates, a full ticket for\r\nboth Congress and the State legislature having been nominated. It was\r\na bitter contest in which he engaged. The Whigs pointed out that they\r\nwere standing out against the annexation of Texas, a slave empire in\r\nitself, and that votes for a third party would but pave the way for a\r\nDemocratic victory. This is exactly what happened. In Michigan the\r\nLiberty Party polled six and a half per cent of the votes, but even\r\nthis added to the Whig vote would not have brought victory.[5] Bibb\r\ncontinued to work for the Liberty Party during 1844 and 1845, going\r\nalso into Ohio with Samuel Brooks and Amos Dresser. They were more\r\nthan once mobbed and their meetings broken up by rowdies. Of their\r\nwork Bibb writes:\r\n\r\n     \"Our meetings were generally appointed in small log cabins,\r\n     schoolhouses, among the farmers, which were sometimes crowded\r\n     full; and where they had no horse teams it was often the case\r\n     that there would be four or five ox teams come, loaded down with\r\n     men, women and children to attend our meetings. The people were\r\n     generally poor and in many places not able to give us a decent\r\n     night's lodgings. We generally carried with us a few pounds of\r\n     candles to light up the houses wherein we held our meetings after\r\n     night; for in many places they had neither candles nor\r\n     candlesticks. After meeting was out we have frequently gone\r\n     three to eight miles to get lodgings, through the dark forest\r\n     where there was scarcely any road for a wagon to run on. I have\r\n     travelled for miles over swamps where the roads were covered with\r\n     logs without any dirt over them, which has sometimes shook and\r\n     jostled the wagon to pieces where we could find no shop or place\r\n     to mend it. We would have to tie it up with bark, or take the\r\n     lines to tie it with and lead the horse by the bridle. At other\r\n     times we were in mud up to the hubs of the wheels.\"\r\n\r\nBibb found his real work when, with the passing of the Fugitive Slave\r\nLaw in 1850, there began a trek of colored people out of the Northern\r\nStates into Canada.[6] Before the end of 1850 several thousand of\r\nthese people had crossed the border and the situation was one that\r\ncalled not only for the aid of generous Canadians but for all that\r\nleaders among their own people could do for them. It was Henry Bibb's\r\nbelief that the future of the people of color in Canada depended upon\r\ngetting them settled on the land and his mind turned to the\r\npossibilities of establishing a distinctly Negro colony on land that\r\nmight be secured as a grant from the Canadian government or, if\r\nnecessary, purchased from the government as had been done in the case\r\nof the Buxton settlement established by Rev. William King in what is\r\nnow Southwestern Ontario. Bibb succeeded in organizing his\r\ncolonization society, its object being \"to assist the refugees from\r\nAmerican slavery to obtain permanent homes and to promote their\r\nsocial, moral, physical and intellectual development.\" It was proposed\r\nthat 50,000 acres of land should be purchased from the government at\r\nan estimated cost of about two dollars an acre, the purchase money to\r\nbe derived partly from contributions and partly from the sale of the\r\nland. Each family settling was to receive 25 acres, five acres to be\r\nfree of cost provided they cleared and cultivated it within three\r\nyears from the time of occupation. The remaining twenty acres was to\r\nbe paid for in nine annual installments. Only landless refugees were\r\nto receive grants, transfer except after fifteen years occupation was\r\nforbidden and all lands vacated by removal or extinction of families\r\nwere to revert to the parent society. Money returned to the society\r\nwas to be spent on schools, for payment of teachers and for the\r\npurchase of new land. The whole business of the organization was to be\r\nin the hands of a board of trustees.[7]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1851 Bibb had established a little newspaper,\r\npublished bi-monthly and known as _The Voice of the Fugitive_. In the\r\nissue of March 12, 1851, he raises the question as to what the\r\nfugitives stand most in need of and holds that charity is but a\r\nhandicap to their progress and that they must work for their own\r\nsupport, preferably on the land. The recommendation of a recent\r\nconvention at Sandwich is quoted to the effect that the refugees\r\nshould go into agriculture, and that to this end an effort should be\r\nmade to secure a grant of land from the Canadian government, this land\r\nto be disposed of in 25-acre plots. Bibb suggested that there should\r\nbe at least 20,000 acres secured at once.\r\n\r\nTo aid in forwarding the plans Bibb enlisted the support of a number\r\nof Michigan people and at a meeting held in Detroit on May 21, 1851,\r\nthe Refugee's Home Society was organized with the following officers:\r\npresident, Deacon E. Fish, Birmingham; vice-president, Robert Garner;\r\nsecretary, Rev. E. E. Kirkland, Colchester; assistant secretary,\r\nWilliam Newman. It was decided that an effort should be made to secure\r\n50,000 acres of land. New officers appear to have been elected almost\r\nimmediately after the society had started operations, the new\r\nexecutives being as follows: president: J. Stone, Detroit;\r\nvice-president, A. L. Power, Farmington; secretary, E. P. Benham,\r\nFarmington; treasurer, Horace Hallock, Detroit.[8] The whole movement\r\nwas heartily approved at a convention of colored people held at\r\nSandwich on May 26, 1851. The Canada Land Company offered to sell\r\nlarge blocks of land to the Society at from two to four dollars an\r\nacre but no large purchases were immediately made. Instead, the\r\nsociety began a canvass for funds, sending out Charles C. Foote of\r\nCommerce and E. P. Benham of Farmington for this purpose. A letter\r\nfrom Foote in _The Voice of the Fugitive_ of July 30, 1851, says \"The\r\nplan seems popular and he looks forward to the day when the colored\r\npeople will nestle in the mane of the British lion.\" In the latter\r\npart of 1851 a purchase of land was made from the Canada Company and a\r\ncontract was entered into for further purchases as soon as the funds\r\nshould be available.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Society held in Farmington on January 29, 1852,\r\nthe following officers were elected: president, Nathan Stone, Detroit;\r\nvice-president, A. L. Power, Farmington; treasurer, Horace Hallock,\r\nDetroit; recording secretary, E. P. Benham, Livonia; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Mary Bibb, Windsor; Executive William Lolason,\r\nDetroit; Colman Freeman, Windsor; Elisha Vanzant, Detroit; David\r\nHotchkiss, Amherstburg; and Henry Bibb, Windsor, Vanzant and Bibb were\r\nappointed trustees, the latter reporting the purchase of 200 acres of\r\nland at three dollars an acre. It was decided to reserve ten acres for\r\nschool purposes, to send out J. F. Dolbeare as agent to collect funds\r\nand to make Bibb's newspaper the official organ of the society.[10]\r\n\r\nThe second annual report of the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada (1853)\r\nreported that at that time the Refugee's Home Society had purchased\r\n1328 acres of land of which 600 acres had been taken up by settlers.\r\nThe scheme was considered a good one but it was emphasized that good\r\nmanagement would be needed. The progress of the Elgin or Buxton\r\nsettlement showed that success was possible.\r\n\r\nWhen Benjamin Drew visited Canada in 1854 he found that the Society\r\nhad purchased nearly 2,000 acres of land, that forty of the 25-acre\r\nplots had been taken up and that there were 20 families located. A\r\nschool was being maintained during three-fourths of the year,\r\nintoxicating liquors had been completely banned and a society known as\r\nthe True Band had been organized to look after the best moral and\r\neducational interests of the colony.[11] The colony was fortunate in\r\nthe first teacher that was engaged for the school. This was Mrs. Laura\r\nS. Haviland, who came in the fall of 1852 and began her work in the\r\nframe building which had been erected for general meeting purposes. So\r\ngreat was the interest in her Bible classes that even aged people\r\nwould come many miles to attend. Similar success attended her\r\nexperiment of an unsectarian church. In her autobiography she tells\r\nsomething of the conditions in the colony while she was there. In\r\ntheir clearings the settlers raised corn, potatoes and other\r\nvegetables while a few had put in two or three acres of wheat. Mrs.\r\nHaviland's account of the colony is much more favorable than some of\r\nthe adverse stories that were sent abroad regarding it.[12]\r\n\r\nRev. W. M. Mitchell, who was a Negro missionary among his own people\r\nin Toronto, makes the following reference to the colony in his\r\n\"Underground Railroad\":\r\n\r\n     \"About ten miles from Windsor there is a settlement of 5000 acres\r\n     which extends over a large part of Essex county. It is called the\r\n     Fugitives' Home. Several years ago a very enterprising and\r\n     intelligent fugitive slave ... bought land from the government,\r\n     divided it into 20-acre plots and sold it to other fugitives,\r\n     giving them five to ten years for payments. Emigrants settled\r\n     here in such large numbers that it is called the Fugitives' Home.\r\n     The larger portion of the land is still uncultivated, a great\r\n     deal is highly cultivated and many are doing well.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer goes on to point out the evidences of the material\r\nadvancement of the colony. There were two schools, the government\r\npaying half the salary of the teacher and the other half being\r\ncollected from the parents. The school he found was also used for the\r\nchurch services, though the spirituality of the people seemed low.[13]\r\n\r\nThe record of Henry Bibb's activities in Canada show that he took a\r\nbroad view of the refugee question. He associated himself actively\r\nwith the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada at its formation in 1851 and\r\nat the first annual meeting held in Toronto in 1852 was elected one of\r\nthe vice-presidents. In the reports of this organization will be found\r\nseveral references to his work. He was also the first president of the\r\nWindsor branch of the Anti-Slavery Society and made several tours\r\nthrough the western end of Upper Canada visiting the Negro communities\r\nand speaking on the slavery issue. In his newspaper, _The Voice of the\r\nFugitive_, he chronicled every movement that would aid in the uplift\r\nof his people and set forth their needs in an admirable way. Its\r\ncolumns give a large amount of information concerning the fugitives in\r\nCanada after 1850.\r\n\r\nBibb's colonization plan was a well-meant effort to improve the status\r\nof the Negro in Canada. While it lacked the permanence of the Elgin\r\nsettlement, which even today preserves its character, it opened the\r\nway for a certain number of the refugees to provide for their own\r\nneeds and it lessened to some extent the congestion of refugees in\r\nborder towns like Windsor and Sandwich. It is a debatable question\r\nwhether segregation of these people was wise or not. At that time it\r\nseemed almost the only solution of the very pressing problem. After\r\nthe Civil war many of the Negroes in Canada returned to the United\r\nStates and those who remained found conditions easier. There was\r\nusually work for any man who was willing to labor and it is a\r\nwell-recorded fact that many of the fugitives, entering the country\r\nunder the most adverse of circumstances, succeeded in getting ahead\r\nand gathering together property. Benjamin Drew's picture of the\r\nCanadian Negroes as he found them in the middle of the fifties is\r\nfavorable and when Dr. Samuel G. Howe investigated the Canadian\r\nsituation on behalf of the Freedmen's Inquiry Commission in 1863[14]\r\nhe was able to report:\r\n\r\n     \"The refugees in Canada earn a living, and gather property; they\r\n     marry and respect women; they build churches and send their\r\n     children to schools; they improve in manners and morals--not\r\n     because they are picked men but simply because they are free men.\r\n     Each of them may say, as millions will soon say, 'When I was a\r\n     slave, I spake as a slave, I understood as a slave, I thought as\r\n     a slave; but when I became a free man I put away slavish\r\n     things.'\"\r\n\r\n                                             FRED LANDON\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Williams, G.

This egregious error,\r\nhowever, was discovered by the pioneers of the new era in education,\r\nwho saw clearly enough that the strength of the nation depended upon\r\nthe _professional_ as well as the academic equipment of its teachers\r\nand thus the training school for teachers had its birth. Its influence\r\nhas been most significant in raising the standards of efficiency in\r\nthe elementary schools and equally significant is its need in the high\r\nschools and colleges of this country.\r\n\r\nNo one in the District of Columbia can think of the benefits derived\r\nfrom the professional teacher training without immediate recollection\r\nand sacred memory of its pioneer and benefactress, Myrtilla Miner. For\r\nher noble character, her high ideals, her progressive methods in\r\neducation, her struggles against opposition in the pursuit of her\r\nGodgiven task, her lasting contribution of an organized institution\r\nfor the training of teachers in the spirit of the Master to serve all\r\nhumanity, the citizens of the District of Columbia and especially the\r\npeople of color must ever revere her memory.[1]\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of March, 1815, in Brookfield, Madison County, New York,\r\nMyrtilla Miner, of poor and humble, yet of industrious parentage, was\r\nborn. As a child, though frail of physique and deprived of\r\nopportunity, her indomitable will enabled her to overcome the\r\nobstacles of poverty and superstition as well as poor health. Wading\r\nthrough them all she earned enough by arduous labor in the hopfields\r\nnear her home to purchase books for her further enlightenment. These\r\nstruggles against fate, however, were the rocks upon which her noble\r\ncharacter was built. Here were sown the seed of sympathy for the weak,\r\nappreciation for the struggling, and respect for the ambitious.\r\n\r\nAfter a year's training at Clinton, Oneida County, New York, where she\r\nobtained the elements of education under the most adverse\r\ncircumstances of ill health and lack of funds, Miss Miner accepted a\r\ncall to teach in Mississippi in order to pay the debts incurred for\r\nthe training she had already received. Her experience in Mississippi\r\nwas indeed invaluable, for there she learned through horrible\r\nexperiences the evils of the institution of slavery. She boldly\r\nprotested against the cruelties of the slaveholders and the\r\ninstitution in general. She innocently requested permission to teach\r\nthe slaves of the planter whose daughters she was then instructing.\r\nWhen told that such was a criminal offense against the laws of\r\nMississippi and that she should \"go North and teach the 'Niggers,'\"\r\nMiss Miner with an intrepid spirit resolved then and there that she\r\n_would_ go North and teach them. Out of this unpleasant experience\r\ndeveloped the determination to found a Normal School for girls of\r\ncolor in the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nReturning North, Miss Miner found other difficulties than poor health\r\nconfronting her in her efforts to establish a school for the Negro\r\nyouth in the District of Columbia. Funds had to be raised, pro-slavery\r\nopposition had to be overcome, and public sentiment had to be changed\r\nat least to indifference. Each of these in itself was sufficiently\r\ncolossal to try the strength, physical and moral, of the ablest\r\nanti-slavery agitators of that day. It was at the time of the passage\r\nof that infamous Fugitive Slave Law, when freedmen and runaways like\r\nWilliam Parker, Jerry McHenry and Joshua Glover were knocked down,\r\nbeaten, bound and cast into prison; when abolitionists were\r\nincarcerated for their anti-slavery propaganda and giving aid to the\r\nfugitives; when even our valiant Frederick Douglass admitted himself\r\ntoo timid to support any such project as that undertaken by Miss Miner\r\nin the city of Washington.[2] It was in times such as these that this\r\nfearless and resolute little woman, with an enthusiasm that seemingly\r\nglistened in her penetrating eyes, determined to give her life to the\r\ncause of alleviating suffering, dispelling ignorance, and liberating\r\nthe oppressed Americans in body and mind.\r\n\r\nWith the small sum of one hundred dollars that she had secured from\r\nMrs. Ednah Thomas,[3] of Philadelphia, a member of the Society of\r\nFriends, Miss Miner started out upon her great work in behalf of the\r\nNegro children of the District of Columbia. Her thrift prompted her to\r\nsolicit funds of various and peculiar sorts. Donations of old papers,\r\nbooks, weights, measures and other castaway material were transformed\r\nby this real teacher into valuable material for the instruction of her\r\nundeveloped pupils.\r\n\r\nFunds of the material sort were not the only difficulties that beset\r\nher road of progress, for pro-slavery opposition assailed Miss Miner\r\nfrom every side.[4] Such propaganda as the following appeared in the\r\n_National Intelligencer_, a Washington newspaper of pro-slavery\r\nsentiments and was spread far and wide. (1) The school would attract\r\nfree colored people from the adjoining States, (2) it was proposed to\r\ngive them an education far beyond what their political and social\r\ncondition would justify, (3) the school would be a center of\r\ninfluence directed against the existence of slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia, and (4) it might endanger the institution of slavery and\r\neven rend asunder the Union itself.[5]\r\n\r\nThe truth of some parts of this declaration was quite evident and\r\nirrefutable, for education, as Miss Miner understood it, was destined\r\nto make every slave a man and every man free. This, of course,\r\nincreased the difficulty of Miss Miner's task but her faith was\r\nabiding and her courage unabated. Miss Miner realized fully that the\r\nlot of the eight thousand free people of color of the District of\r\nColumbia was but little better than that of the 3,000 slaves, for the\r\nformer, though free according to the letter of the law, in actual life\r\nhad no rights that a white man was compelled to respect. They were not\r\nadmitted to public institutions, could not attend the city schools,\r\ncould not testify against a white man in court, and could not travel\r\nwithout a pass without running the risk of being cast into prison.\r\n\r\nAmidst it all, on the 6th day of December 1851, in a rented room about\r\nfourteen feet square, in the frame house on Eleventh Street near New\r\nYork Avenue then owned and occupied as a dwelling by Edward C.\r\nYounger,[6] a Negro, Myrtilla Miner with six pupils established as a\r\nprivate institution for the education of girls of color the first\r\nNormal School in the District of Columbia and the fourth one in the\r\nUnited States. Increase of enrollment soon forced her to secure\r\naccommodations and within two months she had moved into a house on the\r\nnorth side of F Street between Eighteenth and Nineteenth, near the\r\nhouse then occupied by William T. Carroll and Charles H. Winder. This\r\nhouse furnished her a very comfortable room for her growing school of\r\nwell-behaved girls, from the best Negro families of the District of\r\nColumbia. Threats on the part of white neighbors to set fire to the\r\nhouse forced her to leave the home of the Negro family with whom she\r\nhad stayed but one month and to seek quarters elsewhere. Miss Miner\r\nthen succeeded in getting accommodations in the dwelling-house of a\r\nGerman family on K Street, near the K Street market. After tarrying a\r\nfew months there, she moved to L Street into a room in the building\r\nknown as the \"The Two Sisters,\" then occupied by a white family. But\r\nthe inconvenience of holding school in rented quarters of private\r\ndwellings proved a very unpleasant one indeed; for not only did she\r\nsuffer the lack of comfort which such quarters naturally could not\r\noffer, but found herself constantly harassed by the necessity of\r\nmoving to escape the enmity and persecution of her white neighbors.\r\n\r\nA new day, however, was to dawn. With the aid of Harriet Beecher\r\nStowe, Dr. Gamaliel Bailey and a few such faithful Philadelphia\r\nfriends as Thomas Williamson, Samuel Rhoads, Benjamin Tatham, Jasper\r\nCope and Catherine Morris, enough funds were raised to purchase a site\r\nof three acres or more for a permanent home on a lot near N Street and\r\nNew Hampshire Avenue, between Nineteenth and Twentieth Streets,\r\nNorthwest. Though the environment of this new home was most pleasing\r\nand beautiful, being surrounded with flowers and fruit trees, the\r\nenmity of the white hoodlums still followed her. She and her pupils\r\nwere frequently assailed with torrents of stones and other missiles.\r\nOnce threatened by mob violence, Miss Miner bravely and defiantly\r\nexclaimed, \"Mob my school! You dare not! If you tear it down over my\r\nhead I shall get another house. There is no law to prevent my teaching\r\nthese people and I shall teach them even unto death!\" Testimony of\r\nsome of Miss Miner's former pupils upholds such a defiance as truly\r\ndescriptive of her fearless nature.\r\n\r\nIn its earlier days the Miner Normal School was supported by private\r\nfunds and directed by a board of trustees consisting of Benjamin\r\nTatham and H. W. Bellows of New York; Samuel M. Janney of Virginia;\r\nJohns Hopkins of Baltimore; Samuel Rhoads and Thomas Williamson of\r\nPhiladelphia; G. Bailey and L. D. Gale of Washington; C. E. Stowe of\r\nAndover; H. W. Beecher of Brooklyn, together with an executive\r\ncommittee consisting of S. J. Bowen, J. M. Wilson and L. D. Gale of\r\nWashington; Miss Miner, principal and William H. Beecher, secretary.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum of the school then embraced boarding, domestic economy,\r\nteachers' training course and the primary departments. It is\r\ninteresting to note that some of the advanced ideas in education\r\ntoday, such as student self-government, vitalized teaching, socialized\r\nrecitation, and civic as well as personal hygiene, were taught and\r\npracticed by Miss Miner during the fifties of the last century.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of pupil self-government, I quote the following\r\nfrom the _Memoir of M. Miner_ by Mrs. Ellen M. O'Connor, concerning a\r\nvisit made by Miss Margaret Robinson of Philadelphia to Miss Miner's\r\nschool: \"In the winter of 1853 accompanied by a friend, I visited the\r\nschool of Myrtilla Miner, under circumstances of peculiar interest.\r\nArriving about ten A. M., we learned from a pupil at the door that the\r\nteacher was absent on business of importance to the school. We were\r\nnot a little disappointed, supposing all recitations would await her\r\ncoming. What was our surprise on entering to find every girl in her\r\nplace, closely occupied with her studies. We seated ourselves by\r\npolite invitation; soon a class read; then one in mental arithmetic\r\nexercised itself, the more advanced pupils acting as monitors; all was\r\ndone without confusion. When the teacher entered she expressed no\r\nsurprise, but took up the business where she found it and went on.\" On\r\none occasion, being obliged to leave for several days, Miss Miner\r\npropounded to the pupils the question, whether the school should be\r\nclosed, or they should continue their exercises without her? They\r\nchose the latter. On her return she found all doing well, not the\r\nleast disorder having occurred.\r\n\r\nAs to vitalized teaching, Matilda Jones Madden, one of Miss Miner's\r\npupils, wrote the following: \"She gave special attention to the proper\r\nwriting of letters and induced a varied correspondence between many\r\nprominent persons and her pupils, thus in a practical way bringing her\r\nschool into larger notice with many of its patrons and friends and\r\nvastly increasing the experience of her pupils.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. John F. N. Wilkinson, a former pupil of Miss Miner, of\r\nWashington, D. C., states that Miss Miner held classes in astronomy\r\nwith the larger girls who were required to meet at the school in the\r\nevenings to study their lessons from nature. Mrs. Amelia E. Wormley,\r\nthe mother of the writer, residing in Washington, also a pupil of Miss\r\nMiner, recalls vividly the emphasis which Miss Miner placed upon the\r\nteaching of physical culture and the tenderness with which she handled\r\nthe younger children of her school.[7]\r\n\r\nThe school increased in usefulness and importance. As a result of\r\nthis, on March 3, 1863, the Senate and House of Representatives passed\r\nan act to incorporate this institution for the education of girls of\r\ncolor in the District of Columbia. By the act William H. Channing,\r\nGeorge J. Abbot, Miss Miner, and others, their associate and\r\nsuccessors were constituted and declared a body politic and corporate\r\nby the name and title of \"The Institution for the Education of Colored\r\nYouth,\" to be located in the District of Columbia. Though this act of\r\nCongress legalized the institution, the school appears to have lapsed\r\ninto inactivity from 1863 to 1871 because of the absence of its\r\nguiding spirit, Miss Miner. On account of ill health she was\r\ncompelled to give up the work, and the strain and stress of civil\r\naffairs reduced national interest and support to a minimum. After a\r\nsojourn of three years in California in search of renewed energy and\r\nmore funds for the fulfillment of her plans and the consummation of\r\nher ideals, Miss Miner departed from this life at the home of Mrs.\r\nNancy M. Johnson of Washington, D. C., on the 17th of December 1864.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the work of the school was resumed in connection with Howard\r\nUniversity. A preparatory and Normal Department was opened and\r\ncontrolled by this institution but supported by the Miner Funds. The\r\nschool existed in this connection until September 13, 1876, when it\r\nbegan a separate and independent existence which lasted until 1879\r\nwhen it was taken over by the school system of the District of\r\nColumbia. From 1879 to 1887 the Miner Normal School was jointly\r\ncontrolled by the Board[8] of Trustees of the Public Schools of the\r\nDistrict and the Miner Board of Trustees, the principal's salary being\r\npaid by the Miner Board to which she made her reports while the\r\nobligation of keeping up the enrollment of the school was assumed by\r\nthe Trustees representing the District Government.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the Trustees of the District assumed full charge of the school\r\nthus centralizing authority and management. The unification of the\r\ndual management under District authority added keener interest on the\r\npart of the citizenship of the community and a deeper feeling of\r\nresponsibility on the part of the faculty. Fortunately for the\r\ninstitution, moreover, the women who succeeded Miss Miner as the heads\r\nof this institution caught the great spirit of their predecessor and\r\nin their efforts to continue the useful work which she had done,\r\nfollowed so closely in the path which she had trodden as to assure\r\nsuccess and preclude any necessity for general reorganization.\r\n\r\nThe first of these women to take up the work of Miss Miner, was Miss\r\nMary B. Smith, of Beverly, Massachusetts, who was assisted by her\r\nsister Miss Sarah R. Smith. These two worthy ladies were succeeded by\r\nMiss Martha Briggs who is characterized by Dr. W. S. Montgomery in his\r\n_Historical Sketch on Education for the Colored Race in the District\r\nof Columbia, 1807-1905_, \"as a born teacher whose work showed those\r\nqualities of head and heart that have made her name famous in the\r\nannals of education in the character of the graduates. The student\r\nteachers caught her missionary spirit and went forth from her presence\r\nstronger souls, full of sympathy to magnify the teacher's vocation and\r\nto inspire the learner. Many of the women who sat at her feet are\r\nlaboring in the schools here now, filling the highest positions and in\r\nbeauty and richness of character running like a thread of gold through\r\nthe teaching corps.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Briggs was succeeded in 1883 by Dr. Lucy E. Moten, who after\r\nfaithful and successful service for thirty-seven years, retired June\r\n20, 1920. As principal of the Miner Normal School, Dr. Moten graduated\r\nthe majority of the teachers now employed in the public schools of the\r\nDistrict. She saw the Normal course lengthened from a one year course\r\nto that of a two year course, offering greater opportunity for broader\r\nprofessional equipment of the student teachers, the results of which\r\nare manifest in the Washington Public Schools today. This school,\r\nhowever, is destined in the near future to undergo other changes in\r\nthe line of progress. It may be the extension of the course to three\r\nyears or the development of a Teacher's college of four years which\r\nwill offer courses leading to a degree. With an enthusiastic\r\nwhole-hearted response of the teaching corps of Washington, D. C., to\r\nthe slogan of the new Superintendent, Dr. Frank Washington\r\nBallou--\"Hats off to the past and coats off to the future,\" The Miner\r\nNormal School will reach higher in its aim to serve and realize the\r\nideals of its noble founder and benefactress, whose struggles and\r\nsacrifices are sacred in the memory of every teacher of color in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\n                                             G. SMITH WORMLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The facts set forth in this sketch were obtained largely from\r\nEllen M. O'Connor's _Myrtilla Miner, A Memoir_; W. S.

Some\r\nvaluable facts were also obtained from former pupils of Miss Myrtilla\r\nMiner now residing in the District of Columbia and from public\r\nspirited citizens who cooperated with her.\r\n\r\n[2] O'Connor, _Memoir of Myrtilla Miner, Letter of Frederick\r\nDouglass_, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[3] _Special Report of Commissioner of Education_, Washington, D.C.,\r\nHenry Barnard, 1868, p. 207.\r\n\r\n[4] She had some friends, however, as the following shows:\r\n\r\n     \"There are in the United States 500,000 free people of color.\r\n     They are generally, although subject to taxation, excluded by law\r\n     or prejudice from schools of every grade. Their case becomes at\r\n     once an object of charity which rises infinitely above all party\r\n     or sectional lines. This charity we are gratified in being able\r\n     to state has already been inaugurated, through the devoted labors\r\n     of an excellent young lady from Western New York by the name of\r\n     Miss Myrtilla Miner who has established and maintained for the\r\n     past four years in the city of Washington a school for the\r\n     education of free colored youth. This school is placed there\r\n     because it is national ground, and the nation is responsible for\r\n     the well-being of its population; because there are there 11,000\r\n     of this suffering people excluded by law from schools and\r\n     destitute of instruction; because there are in the adjoining\r\n     States of Maryland and Virginia 130,000 equally destitute, who\r\n     can be reached in no other way; and because it is hoped through\r\n     this means to reach a class of girls of peculiar interest, often\r\n     the most beautiful and intelligent, and yet the most hopelessly\r\n     wretched, and who are often objects of strong paternal affection.\r\n     The slaveholder would gladly educate and save these children, but\r\n     domestic peace drives them from his hearth; he cannot emancipate\r\n     them to be victims of violence or lust; he cannot send them to\r\n     Northern schools, where prejudice would brand them, and it is\r\n     proposed to open an asylum near them, where they may be brought,\r\n     emancipated, educated and taught housewifery as well as science,\r\n     and thus be prepared to become teachers among their own mixed\r\n     race.\r\n\r\n     \"In its present condition this school embraces boarding, domestic\r\n     economy, normal teachers and primary departments, and is placed\r\n     under the care of an association consisting of the following\r\n     trustees: Benjamin Tatham, New York; Samuel M. Janney, Loudoun\r\n     County, Virginia; Johns Hopkins, Baltimore; Samuel Rhoads and\r\n     Thomas Williamson, Philadelphia; G. Bailey and L. D. Gale,\r\n     Washington; H. W. Bellows, New York; C. E. Stowe, Andover; H. W.\r\n     Beecher, Brooklyn, together with an executive committee\r\n     consisting of S. J. Bowen, J. M. Wilson and L. D. Gale, of\r\n     Washington; and M. Miner, Principal, and William H. Beecher, of\r\n     Reading, Secretary.\r\n\r\n     \"The trustees state that a very eligible site of three acres,\r\n     within the city limits of Washington, of the northwest, has\r\n     already been purchased, paid for and secured to the trustees, and\r\n     that all which is now wanted is $20,000 wherewith to erect a\r\n     larger and more suitable edifice for the reception of the\r\n     applicants pressing upon it from the numerous free colored blacks\r\n     in the District and adjacent States. The proposed edifice is\r\n     designed to accommodate 150 scholars and to furnish homes for the\r\n     teachers and pupils from a distance. The enlarged school will\r\n     include the higher branches in its system of instruction.\r\n\r\n     \"There was a meeting yesterday afternoon, in an ante-room of\r\n     Tremont Temple, of gentlemen called together to listen to the\r\n     statements of the Secretary of the Association regarding this\r\n     school. The meeting was small, but embraced such gentlemen as\r\n     Hon. George S. Hillard, Rev. Dr. Lathrop, Rev. C. E. Hale, and\r\n     Deacon Greele, all of whom are deeply interested in the project.\r\n\r\n     \"The meeting decided to draw up and circulate a subscription\r\n     paper, and counted upon receiving $10,000 for the purpose in this\r\n     city. The pastors of several churches in New York had pledged\r\n     their churches in the sum of a thousand dollars each. Mr. Beecher\r\n     will solicit subscriptions in most of the principal towns of\r\n     Massachusetts. The designs and benefits of the project will be\r\n     fully set forth at a public meeting in this city in the course of\r\n     a fortnight.\"--_The Boston Journal_, April 18, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[5] An extract from Walter Lenox's article opposing Miss Miner's\r\nSchool, follows:\r\n\r\n     \"With justice we can say to the advocate of this measure, you are\r\n     not competent to decide this question: your habits of thought,\r\n     your ignorance of our true relations to the colored population,\r\n     prevent you from making a full and candid examination of its\r\n     merits, and, above all, the temper of the public mind is\r\n     inauspicious, even for its consideration. If your humanity\r\n     demands this particular sphere for its action, and if, to use\r\n     your own language, prejudice would brand them at your northern\r\n     schools, establish institutions in the free States, dispense your\r\n     money there abundantly as your charity will supply, draw to them\r\n     the unfortunate at your own door, or from abroad, and in all\r\n     respects gratify the largest impulses of your philanthropy; but\r\n     do not seek to impose upon us a system contrary to our wishes and\r\n     interests, and for the further reason that by so doing you injure\r\n     the cause of those whom you express a wish to serve.\"--_National\r\n     Intelligencer_, May 6, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[6] _Special Report_, Commissioner of Education, Washington, D.

C. G. WOODSON\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\n     Absence from home has prevented my replying to your request\r\n     sooner.\r\n\r\n     The majority of masters in this section of the country were kind\r\n     to their slaves. They gave them plenty of good wholesome food,\r\n     good clothes, (warm ones in winter) comfortable homes and\r\n     attention from Doctors when sick. There were churches on nearly\r\n     every plantation and ministers provided to preach to them. The\r\n     _only very cruel_ masters were _Northern men_ who treated their\r\n     slaves like _beasts_. For many years it was against the law to\r\n     teach negroes to read or write because some of them would read\r\n     things from the North that made them dissatisfied but our family\r\n     owned such good negroes, who had principle like white people we\r\n     did not think it could hurt them, and we taught them to read and\r\n     write. There has always been a kind feeling between the whites\r\n     and slaves in this country. The young ones were our playmates in\r\n     childhood. The older ones our nurses and cooks who petted us and\r\n     loved us as their own color. They were faithful during the War\r\n     when our protectors were in the Army, and now altho' it is fifty\r\n     years since they were freed, many of them are our best\r\n     friends.--I do not know of anything else you wanted to know or I\r\n     would gladly write you. In some sections of the South there may\r\n     have been cruel treatment but it was generally from the overseers\r\n     who were ignorant men and took advantage of their position to\r\n     give license to their cruel natures.\r\n\r\n     James Childs and all of his family and many of his relatives\r\n     belonged to my mother, and there still exists a kind feeling\r\n     between us that will only be severed by Death. I would like to\r\n     hear from him.

In Louisiana and, I think, in\r\n     some other states, in Reconstruction days, the\r\n     lieutenant-governorship was conceded by the Republican party,\r\n     regularly, to a man of color. These men were sometimes, to say no\r\n     more, of high character and ability. Such a one in Louisiana was\r\n     Oscar J. Dunn, the first of them. He was of unmixt African\r\n     origin. His signal ability and high integrity were acknowledged\r\n     by his political enemies in the most rancorous days of his\r\n     career, and his funeral was attended by Confederate generals.\r\n\r\n     I wish your enterprise the fullest measure of success.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours truly,\r\n                                        (Signed) GEO.

C.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\n     I recently received from you a letter followed soon by a volume\r\n     of THE JOURNAL OF NEGRO HISTORY edited by yourself which I have\r\n     scanned and am much impressed with its merits and consider a\r\n     valuable contribution to our historical literature.\r\n\r\n     It is somewhat unusual to find colored men in America of American\r\n     birth who are individually conversant with all of the West Indies\r\n     a part of South America and the western part of Europe.\r\n\r\n     My advent in life began at an epoch in the early history of\r\n     Baltimore when incidents occurred that seem to have escaped the\r\n     notice of the numerous writers of the history of our race which I\r\n     shall briefly relate.\r\n\r\n     Owing to the rapid decadence of the sugar industries of the\r\n     British West Indies on the Abolition of Slavery and the gravity\r\n     anent the threatened ruin of the peasantry, some philanthropists\r\n     and business men from England were sent to Baltimore to try to\r\n     get free colored people to go to Trinidad. They spoke in many\r\n     colored churches and succeeded in interesting them so that\r\n     several shiploads were sent. My father and mother and three\r\n     children were of the number. I was an infant in arms.\r\n\r\n     I received an education there and after I grew up was variously\r\n     employed as bookkeeper, clerking in dry goods stores, in the City\r\n     Hall, overseer on sugar estate, coach and sign painter, was\r\n     afterwards sent for by my father who was at the gold mines of\r\n     Caratal in Venezuela and on my return to Trinidad visited several\r\n     other islands of the West Indies.\r\n\r\n     I next returned to America my natal home the second year of\r\n     Andrew Johnson's term.\r\n\r\n     I have not since led an idle life. For nearly 25 years I have\r\n     been engaged as an itinerant private tutor teaching adult folks\r\n     and I flatter myself that I was very successful among the\r\n     hundreds of my pupils.\r\n\r\n     I found on my arrival in America that education was at a very low\r\n     ebb amongst the members of my race perhaps not more than 15% of\r\n     adult folks one would encounter in the streets could read and\r\n     write.\r\n\r\n     When the Amendments were passed by Congress conferring\r\n     citizenship upon colored people I threw myself into the political\r\n     current and was the first vice president of the 11th ward of\r\n     Baltimore city which a few years subsequently chose a colored\r\n     councilman, Harry Cummins.\r\n\r\n     I became a merchant meanwhile experimenting in groceries, but\r\n     after a year relinquished this for dry goods for which my early\r\n     acquaintance therewith amply fitted me. I kept a dry goods store\r\n     in Baltimore for seven years then went to Jacksonville, Fla.\r\n     where I successfully continued the business for eighteen years.\r\n\r\n     While I was in Baltimore I twice passed the Civil Service\r\n     examination with a handsome percentage this I did simply from\r\n     curiosity. I kept strictly to merchandise and have never earned a\r\n     dollar of Uncle Sam's money.\r\n\r\n     In 1909 and again in 1912 myself and wife, both of us having a\r\n     knowledge of French and Spanish and I a little Italian made a\r\n     tour of Western Europe viz, Gibralter Italy Switzerland France\r\n     Germany Holland Belgium and England plodding on foot amongst the\r\n     common people studying sociological conditions and comparing with\r\n     our own people. I find the contrast of the humbler class of\r\n     Europe also the colored races of the West Indies and South\r\n     America with less opportunities possessed of more enterprise and\r\n     ambition than the colored people of America.\r\n\r\n     It is a lamentable fact that the principal attraction of those\r\n     who should be our strong men and leaders in enterprise those of\r\n     high school and college training consists of Uncle Sam's bounty\r\n     and in the absence of this to cling to some white man in private\r\n     life.\r\n\r\n     I have for many years been an ardent advocate of business amongst\r\n     our people and to this end I have written contributions to the\r\n     _Commonwealth_ of Baltimore a paper once edited by John E. Bruce\r\n     (Bruce Grit) the Colored American of Washington, and to other\r\n     papers edited by our race.\r\n\r\n     My attitude towards other enterprises is that we are sufficiently\r\n     and disproportionately represented in other branches, especially\r\n     teaching preaching politics governmental patronage &c which\r\n     require no financial responsibility; consequently the results\r\n     place us in the attitude of a Castillian gentleman who is\r\n     facetiously described thus--_Caballero sin caballo, Mucho piojo,\r\n     poco dinero_, that is, a knight without a horse, Plenty of lice,\r\n     little money.\r\n\r\n     As a race we are the poorest numerically of any race in America.\r\n     We have so little ambition and so envious and void of race pride.\r\n     We don't mind a white man climbing over our heads but a colored\r\n     man never and if you doubt me keep a store.\r\n\r\n     I have grown weary of the struggle and am leaving the fight to\r\n     the younger men who I hope may prove vigorous champions.\r\n\r\n     I have done my part, I am\r\n\r\n                                   Yours very truly\r\n                                        (Signed) STANSBURY BOYCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        LONDON, ONT. October 25/1918\r\n\r\n     DR. CARTER G. WOODSON,\r\n         _Journal of Negro History_,\r\n             Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Dr. Woodson_,\r\n\r\n     I have been reading your \"Century of Negro Migration\" with\r\n     interest. On page 36 you speak of a change of attitude on the\r\n     part of Canadians towards the refugees. I do not know to what\r\n     this refers. The attitude of the Canadian government never\r\n     changed--it granted asylum and protection right up to the Civil\r\n     War and afterwards. From the very earliest days there was an\r\n     occasional show of prejudice but I doubt if this was greater in\r\n     1855 than in 1845 or 1835. The laws were administered fairly, the\r\n     Negro exercised his vote, could get land cheaply if he desired to\r\n     farm. The chief prejudice was shown in the schools though this\r\n     only in some places, this city for instance. But this was only\r\n     occasional, not general, and you are quite correct in saying that\r\n     \"these British Americans never made the life of the Negro there\r\n     so intolerable as was the case in some of the free States.\"\r\n\r\n     On the same page there is a slight error in the use of the word\r\n     \"towns\" in connection with the settlements of refugees in\r\n     Southern Ontario.\r\n\r\n     \"Dawn\" was not a town but a farming community, \"The Dawn\r\n     Settlement\" \"Colchester\" was the same, it is the name now given\r\n     to a township in Essex county.\r\n\r\n     \"Elgin\" was not the name of a Settlement but of the association\r\n     which managed the settlement. Buxton was the settlement founded\r\n     by the Elgin association.\r\n\r\n     \"Bush\", _i.e._ \"The Bush\" is the term applied to a great tract of\r\n     country north of Toronto, bushland, in which there were some\r\n     Negro farmers.\r\n\r\n     \"Wilberforce\" was also a tract of land divided into farms and\r\n     termed the Wilberforce settlement. It is in Middlesex county,\r\n     near London.\r\n\r\n     \"Riley\" should be \"Raleigh,\" it is the township in which the\r\n     Elgin association's settlement was located. It is in Kent County.\r\n\r\n     \"Anderton\" is also the name of a township in Essex county.\r\n\r\n     \"Gonfield\" should be \"Gosfield.\" It is also a township in Essex\r\n     county.\r\n\r\n     These are only minor matters but you might desire to make the\r\n     change in another edition.\r\n\r\n     I think I shall write something dealing with the Canadian end of\r\n     your subject, from the economic standpoint. The _Journal_ is a\r\n     publication of which as Editor you can be proud. It maintains a\r\n     high standard. I intend to have it added to the Western\r\n     University's list of periodicals this year.\r\n\r\n                                   Sincerely yours,\r\n                                        (Signed) FRED LANDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BIRD-IN-HAND, PA., Aug. 21, 1918.\r\n     CARTER G. WOODSON, ESQ.,\r\n\r\n     _Dear Mr. Woodson_:\r\n\r\n     I have read most of the articles in the JOURNAL with deep\r\n     interest and think it a valuable periodical. One or two mistakes\r\n     I noticed; one writer says that President Lincoln thought that\r\n     \"the war should be over in ninety days.\" It was Seward, _not_\r\n     Lincoln that cherished this almost insane idea.--Please do not\r\n     set me down as a carping critic when I say that I am very sorry\r\n     that the long article on \"Slavery in Kentucky\" was printed\r\n     without comment or correction. To speak of Henry Clay as an\r\n     anti-slavery man seems absurd to people like myself, born into\r\n     _real_ anti-slavery families and familiar almost from infancy\r\n     with the anti-slavery struggle. The interview with Mr.\r\n     Mendenhall, a Friend (Quaker) is told somewhat differently from\r\n     what I heard it in my childhood. I always understood that a\r\n     delegation of Friends called upon him and he told them to go\r\n     home, that his \"Negroes were sleek and fat.\" The comparison\r\n     between Friends and his negroes, as given in Mr. McDougle's\r\n     article is even more insulting than is anything in the story as I\r\n     heard it. One of my earliest recollections is seeing in my\r\n     grandmother's kitchen in Phila., \"Clary\" a little octoroon woman,\r\n     who was, I was told, either once the mistress or else the\r\n     daughter of Henry Clay. From this you may judge what his moral\r\n     reputation must have been.\r\n\r\n                                   Very truly yours,\r\n                              (Signed) (MRS.) MARIANNA G. BRUBAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SOME CORRECTIONS\r\n\r\n                              BIRD-IN-HAND, PA., April 21, 1920.\r\n\r\n     MR. CARTER G. WOODSON,\r\n\r\n     _My dear Mr. Woodson:_\r\n\r\n     On the next page will be found a correction of the article \"The\r\n     Negro Migration to Canada after 1850,\" which you may print or\r\n     not, as you choose. In a historical periodical, accuracy is\r\n     important, is it not?\r\n\r\n                                   Very truly yours,\r\n                              Signed (MRS.) MARIANNA G. BRUBAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     On page 30 of the _Journal of Negro History_ for January\r\n     reference is made to the famous Christiana Riot of Sept. 11,\r\n     1851. Christiana is about nineteen--not two--miles from\r\n     Lancaster. Parker, the hero of this event, was a wonderful man.\r\n     He returned to Christiana in the summer of 1872, spoke at a\r\n     political meeting there and spent some time visiting friends, by\r\n     whom he was greatly admired and respected. The exact distance\r\n     from Lancaster is important because of the very different\r\n     character of the two communities.\r\n\r\n                              (Signed) MARIANNA G.

It has been repeatedly charged that we have no racial\r\n     history. If we are challenged with respect to certain events we\r\n     admit the imputation by our silence. A different course would\r\n     correct much error. _The Journal of Negro History_ for January\r\n     has rendered a very great service by publishing the names and\r\n     number of Negroes who have been members of their respective State\r\n     Legislatures since the Civil War reconstruction. It was\r\n     interesting and informative to note the names and numbers of\r\n     members of our race from these different States.\r\n\r\n     When it came to Virginia the contrast was most painful. To behold\r\n     the absence of detailed information similar to that supplied the\r\n     other States, from North Carolina to Florida, from the Atlantic\r\n     to the Rio Grande. For a time I felt like disowning that Virginia\r\n     was my native State. Finally the obligation incumbent on all\r\n     those who have lived in Virginia during the last fifty years or\r\n     familiar with its history asserted itself, hence I begin but I\r\n     must acknowledge my sense of gratitude to Rev.

WORK,\r\n     Department Records and Research,\r\n     Tuskegee Institute, Alabama.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Mr. Work:_\r\n\r\n     In looking through the last number of _The Journal of Negro\r\n     History_, I note that you are asking for information concerning\r\n     those Negroes who were members of the State Legislatures during\r\n     reconstruction days, just following the Civil War.\r\n\r\n     I do not know if it has already been called to your attention or\r\n     not, but my grandfather, Shandy Jones, was at that time a member\r\n     of the Alabama Legislature. I do not know the year, but think I\r\n     can get the dates for you if it is of interest to you.\r\n\r\n     His early life was spent in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He was a very\r\n     successful business man, barber by trade. His later life was\r\n     actively spent in church work. He was presiding elder in the A.\r\n     M. E. Z. church and was nominated for bishop, but his age was an\r\n     obstacle.\r\n\r\n     He lived in Mobile, Alabama at the time of his death at 70 years.\r\n     He was still in the ministry at this time.\r\n\r\n                                   Very truly,\r\n                                   (Signed) MRS. M. E. RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        245 WEST 139TH ST.,\r\n                                            NEW YORK CITY,\r\n                                                July 22, 1920.\r\n\r\n     CARTER G. WOODSON, Ph.D.,\r\n       Editor _The Journal of Negro History_,\r\n         1216 You St., N. W.,\r\n           Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\n     You have presented the matter of the Reconstruction Period in\r\n     splendid shape and no doubt it will be read with much interest\r\n     especially by the few \"old timers\" who can recall those halcyon\r\n     days.\r\n\r\n     There are some errors I would like to correct and a few additions\r\n     I would like to make as it was not my intention to slight any\r\n     person engaged in that laudable work of making Negro history, and\r\n     I would like to know at your earliest convenience if there will\r\n     be time before the July number goes to press. There is just one\r\n     error I want to correct now and that is relative to myself. In\r\n     the foot notes it is stated that I was a page in the House of\r\n     Representatives in the Reconstruction Period. I do not know how\r\n     Mr. Work made the error as there is nothing in my retained carbon\r\n     copies to show that I gave him that information. It was my\r\n     brother, Dr. J. E. Wallace, now with the Standard Insurance\r\n     Company of Atlanta who occupied that position. I certainly would\r\n     have preferred that job as it was more remunerative than the one\r\n     I held. I was employed in the post office at Columbia, S. C.,\r\n     from March 1, 1871 to August 15, 1886, when I resigned under the\r\n     democratic postmaster, Major W. H. Gibbes, notwithstanding the\r\n     fact that he requested me to continue in the position. It was\r\n     owing to my position that I came in contact with the prominent\r\n     people from all over the State and was thus enabled to get much\r\n     information that has helped me greatly in compiling the data.\r\n     Handling the mail for several years of these Reconstructionists\r\n     made me quite familiar with their names and as the impressions of\r\n     youth are lasting they remained with me.\r\n\r\n     As I understand it the Reconstruction Period is from the close of\r\n     the civil war to April 20, 1877, when the United States troops\r\n     were withdrawn from the New Orleans, La., state house, the troops\r\n     having been withdrawn from the state house in Columbia, S.C.,\r\n     April 10, 1877. Therefore data since then would not be considered\r\n     as belonging to the Reconstruction Period.\r\n\r\n                                   Very Respectfully,\r\n                                       (Signed) HENRY A.

Wilson Williamsburg Co.--Fortune Giles, E. H.\r\n     Gourdin, Thomas Pressley\r\n\r\n     Relative to Hon. J. H. Rainey I would state that he was the only\r\n     Negro Congressman who presided over the U. S. House of\r\n     Representatives. That courtesy was extended to him by Speaker\r\n     James G. Blaine.\r\n\r\n     The following may be interesting in connection with Senator W. B.\r\n     Nash:\r\n\r\n          \"It is not too much to say that the leading man of the\r\n          Republican party in the Senate is Beverly Nash, a man wholly\r\n          black. He is apparently consulted more and appealed to more,\r\n          in the business of the body, than any man in it. It is\r\n          admitted by his white opposition colleagues that he has more\r\n          native ability than half the white men in the State\" _The\r\n          Prostrate State_--J. S. Pike.\r\n\r\n          \"Beverley Nash of Columbia is probably the foremost Negro in\r\n          the State. He has made many speeches, which, homely in\r\n          manner, have, nevertheless, a subsoil of strong common\r\n          sense. He has been employed by the Military authorities from\r\n          time to time in aiding, by \"moral suasion\" to preserve\r\n          peace; is about 45 years of age; was formerly a hotel\r\n          servant in Columbia where he still resides. Some months ago,\r\n          on the same platform with Gen. Wade Hampton and other\r\n          distinguished citizens he made a speech to the colored\r\n          people recommending qualified suffrage; but subsequently was\r\n          obliged by high-pressure to recant, and to set himself right\r\n          has since become intensely radical. His idea now is that the\r\n          Negro is entitled to everything the white man enjoys--an\r\n          opinion which has been encouraged by his appointment as\r\n          magistrate, General Sickles having conferred the office upon\r\n          him to punish the citizens of Columbia for an assault made\r\n          by two intoxicated young men on a itinerant radical speaker\r\n          and his traveling companion while in that town\"\r\n\r\n          \"Q\" in _New York Times_--March 23, 1868.\r\n\r\n     The above would indicate that Senator W. Beverly Nash was the\r\n     first Negro to exercise judicial power in the United States.\r\n\r\n     Concerning Associate Justice J. J. Wright I would add that he\r\n     graduated from the Lancaster, Pa., High School--studied law at\r\n     Montrose, Pa.,--admitted to the Bar in Susquehanna county, being\r\n     the first Negro to practice law in Pennsylvania--four years\r\n     before going to South Carolina.\r\n\r\n                                   Very respectfully,\r\n                                        HENRY A. WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   WASHINGTON, D. C., May 9, 1920.\r\n\r\n     _Dear Mr. Woodson:_\r\n\r\n     _The Journal of Negro History_ is among the most valuable\r\n     periodicals that it is my privilege to receive. I make it a rule\r\n     to read all the articles of a _purely historical_ nature.\r\n\r\n     Your recent effort to gather and print a list of the Negro\r\n     officeholders of the reconstructive period is highly commendable,\r\n     and should be aided by all persons possessing accurate or\r\n     approximate facts on the subjects. There were numerous such\r\n     holders of small offices, national, state, county and municipal,\r\n     in the Southern states in that period. As a boy, I knew two such\r\n     in the town and county in which I lived. Doubtless many other\r\n     persons of 50 years or less know of several.\r\n\r\n     Mr. John W. Cromwell's articles in the April number, \"The\r\n     Aftermath of Nat Turner's Insurrection,\" is not only scholarly\r\n     and interesting but a very valuable contribution to history.\r\n\r\n     There is a vast amount of _fact_ reposing only in the memories of\r\n     elderly people now living that should be rescued and recorded\r\n     while they live, lest it is lost forever. Perhaps the record of\r\n     it will not be _history_ proper but only _annals_, or a record of\r\n     events. It is none the less important to secure it. It is of\r\n     minor importance whether it be written in polished literary form.\r\n     It will constitute source matter for the future historian. For\r\n     some time to come we shall be in less need of dissertations that\r\n     are philosophy of Negro history than of accurate records of\r\n     events--facts, facts, facts!\r\n\r\n     I have conversed with a number of elderly colored men and women\r\n     in this city who have a wonderful fund of recollection of\r\n     interesting and valuable historical data never in print. There\r\n     are such people everywhere. Some cannot write, others will not\r\n     write. If discriminating chroniclers are encouraged to write down\r\n     the stories of such people for publication in your Journal, the\r\n     result should be fruitful.\r\n\r\n     I congratulate you on the average excellence of the subjects\r\n     covered by the Journal and the scholarly editing thereof.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                        (Signed) R. C. EDMONSON.\r\n\r\n     DR. CARTER G. WOODSON,\r\n     Editor, _Journal of Negro History_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME UNDISTINGUISHED NEGROES\r\n\r\nFRED FOWLER\r\n\r\n\r\nFred Fowler was born about 1832 in Frederick County, Maryland. His\r\nfirst master, Michael Reel, had a farm and a flour mill about four\r\nmiles from Frederick City. Reel owned sixteen slaves, among whom were\r\nFred's mother and her eight children. Fred's father belonged to a man\r\nnamed Doyle, who had an adjoining farm. Doyle sold the father to a man\r\nnamed Fisher, who subsequently put up the first gas factory in\r\nFrederick.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Michael Reel, in 1847, his estate had to be divided.\r\nSome of the slaves were disposed of according to appraisement, others\r\nat auction. Fred, then about fifteen years old, was taken at the\r\nappraised value of $400 by a son of the deceased Reel. If auctioned\r\noff, he thought he might have brought somewhat more.\r\n\r\nAt this sale his mother and one child were bought for $500 by a man\r\nnamed Todd, who subsequently sold her to Dr. Shipley. Four children\r\nwere purchased by men supposed to be traders, who presumably took them\r\nto Georgia, which, according to the sentiment of \"Nellie Gray,\" was\r\nthe slave's notion of some far-away place where the speculators found\r\na market. No one of these four was ever seen or heard from after they\r\nwere put on the train for Baltimore. The other children, two sisters,\r\nwere taken away by a man named Roach, but that was all that was then\r\nknown. The almost invariable rule in the inter-state slave-trade was\r\nthat separation ended all communication with those left behind. In\r\n1887--forty years after the sale--these sisters wrote a letter to a\r\ncolored church in Frederick asking for information about the slaves\r\nthat belonged to the Reel family. Someone in the church knew that Fred\r\nFowler was living in Washington, D.C. The letter was forwarded to him\r\nand from it he learned that these sisters had been taken to Columbia,\r\nTennessee and were still living. A meeting soon followed.\r\n\r\nWhen Fred was twenty years old, young Reel, who was about to move to\r\nSpringfield, Illinois, sold him privately for $1,000 to Dr. Willis who\r\nlived in New Market, Frederick County, Maryland. That was a high\r\nprice for the time and place. Fowler was with Dr. Willis for three or\r\nfour years as a farmhand. The Doctor was the physician for the\r\nnotorious inter-state slave traders B. M. and W. L. Campbell. They had\r\na large jail in Baltimore for their purchases in Maryland. In New\r\nOrleans they had another, where most of their sales were made. The\r\nDoctor went to Baltimore once or twice a week to examine and prescribe\r\nfor the Campbell slaves. In the farming season, when there was need of\r\nextra labor, he would bring some of them out to work for him.\r\n\r\nMrs. Salmon, a Quaker, told Fowler that Dr. Willis contemplated\r\nselling him the following winter, probably because some less valuable\r\nslave could do the work. All slaves dreaded being sold, for, if young\r\nand strong, it usually meant being \"sold South.\" So in the spring of\r\n1858 Fowler made up his mind to run away. He and another slave started\r\none Saturday night and safely walked to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania by\r\nthe early morning.\r\n\r\nPromptly on Monday Dr. Willis issued a handbill offering $200 reward\r\nfor the recovery of his runaway. Fowler knew no details of this until\r\nperhaps thirty or forty years later, when a son of Dr. Willis gave him\r\none of the handbills. It was shown about 1905 to the present writer\r\nwho had it carefully typewritten as to the lines and capitalization,\r\nbut the size of the letters could not be reproduced. The original was\r\nduly returned to Fowler, but unfortunately he subsequently lost or\r\nmislaid it. It was tiny for a handbill--only about six inches long and\r\nfour inches wide and was worded and lined thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                              \"$200 REWARD!\r\n\r\n     Ranaway from the subscriber, living at New Market, Frederick Co.,\r\n     Md., ON SATURDAY NIGHT, THE 8TH. OF MAY inst., a Negro Man, named\r\n     FRED FOWLER, aged about 26 years, five feet ten or eleven inches\r\n     high, stout made, dark copper color, round full eye, upper teeth\r\n     full and even, has a down look when spoken to, lisps slightly in\r\n     his speech, and has small hands; no other marks recollected. Had\r\n     on when he left, dark pants and coat and light-made shoes.\r\n\r\n     The above reward will be given for the arrest of said Negro, if\r\n     taken out of the State of Maryland, and his delivery to the\r\n     subscriber; or one hundred dollars, if taken in the State, and\r\n     secured in jail.\r\n\r\n                                        Dr. W. L. Willis.\r\n     New Market, Md., May 10, 1858.\"\r\n\r\nThe same wording long appeared as an advertisement in the Baltimore\r\n_Sun_. Both were all in vain.\r\n\r\nA free Negro, associated with the underground railroad in Pennsylvania\r\nand working as a mason for a company of men who built large barns in\r\nMaryland, had told Fowler to report in Gettysburg to a man by the name\r\nof Mathers. The runaways did so and were concealed until the next\r\nnight. They then walked to Carlisle, Pennsylvania. There they remained\r\nthat day. During the night they went on to Harrisburg. Some\r\nAbolitionists took charge of them and put them on a farm about eight\r\nmiles from town. In August, they proceeded to Bradford, Canada West.\r\nThere Fowler found an aunt who had run away with a party of twelve,\r\nmany years before. He worked on a farm until May, 1862, when he went\r\nto the American Hotel in Lockport, New York to become a waiter. In\r\nAugust, 1863 he left for Hartford, Connecticut, to enlist in the 29th\r\nRegiment of Connecticut Colored Volunteers. The regiment was turned\r\nover to the Government in March, 1864, and was then taken by boat from\r\nHartford to Annapolis Maryland, and there transhipped to Beaufort,\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nAt Beaufort they had a few little skirmishes. Once they were about\r\nsurrounded by the Confederates for five days, and were without food a\r\npart of the time. The Confederates were between Beaufort and Hilton\r\nHead, but did not know to what disadvantage they had the colored\r\nregiment.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1864 the regiment was moved to Bermuda Hundred,\r\nVirginia. On the day of landing they took part in an engagement at\r\nMalvern Hill. They were in several skirmishes and were finally\r\nattacked at Strawberry Plains. From there they were taken to the\r\nWeldon railway, for the purpose of cutting off the southern connection\r\nwith Richmond. They fought there three days and tore up the track. To\r\nmake the rails useless they were heated red-hot and twisted around\r\ntrees. Later, the regiment was taken back to the neighborhood of Fort\r\nHarrison, on which they made an attack. After a few weeks they took\r\nthe Fort and remained there all winter and until a few days before the\r\nfall of Richmond.\r\n\r\nEarly in April, 1865, on a Sunday afternoon the troops in Fort\r\nHarrison saw a large mass of Confederates marching in plain view in\r\nfront of them. \"We thought there must be a million of them marching\r\nthere!\" It was supposed that the Confederates intended soon to attack\r\nFort Harrison. The occupants of the Fort sent out videttes so as to\r\ngive the earliest possible notice of it. Those in the Fort made every\r\npreparation for resistence. But there was no attack. That night three\r\nunarmed Confederates came to the videttes and reported that there were\r\nno troops in front; that the Confederate lines had long been very thin\r\nand that the Federals could march right into Richmond.\r\n\r\nThis was found to be true, for on the following day the Union troops\r\nstarted for the Confederate capitol. Fowler's regiment reached there\r\non the morning of the fall and went to State House Hill, but camped\r\nclose to Libby prison, down near the river. A few days later--a day or\r\ntwo before Lincoln was shot--they left Richmond for City Point, where\r\nthey first heard of his death. From there they were taken to Point\r\nLookout, Maryland, to aid in the search for Booth. After Booth was\r\ncaptured, the regiment returned to City Point, and a week later was\r\nordered to Brownsville, Texas, for the special purpose of getting the\r\nsupplies,--a great collection of cotton, wagons and all sorts of\r\nmunitions--that General Kirby Smith had tried to take to Mexico. The\r\nregiment remained there until the 15th day of October, when Fowler and\r\nthe others were mustered out of the United States service.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1876 he was appointed a messenger in the Library of\r\nCongress, which was then and until about 1900 in the Capitol just west\r\nof the great dome. He was a strong willing worker. Doctor Spofford\r\nrelied on him to find and bring forth from dark and dusty storerooms\r\nthe files of old newspapers when needed for historical purposes. By\r\nthe time that the magnificent Library of Congress building was\r\ncompleted and things were in shipshape, Fowler had reached an age when\r\nhe was entitled to and given less heavy work.\r\n\r\nFor nearly twenty years he was daily at the door of the Reading Room\r\nto admit readers and to refer sightseers to the gallery for the best\r\nview of the grand and beautiful rotunda. He was always so cheerful and\r\npolite that it gave one pleasure to see and exchange greetings with\r\nhim. His remarkable and most honorable career caused him to be\r\nregarded with much wonder by persons of the young generation,\r\nespecially if from the North. By the whole staff of the Library and by\r\nthe many research workers that daily came there, he was regarded with\r\na fondness such as was felt toward no one else.\r\n\r\nHe died October 9, 1919, at the advanced age of about 87 and was\r\nburied in the great National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. There\r\nhis grave and name can be seen among those of men who fought to\r\npreserve the Union, and in doing so destroyed slavery--the \"sacred\r\ninstitution\" of the old South and \"the corner-stone\" of the\r\nshort-lived Confederacy. Fred Fowler served his race and his country\r\nwell and he was well rewarded.\r\n\r\n                                             F. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEATH OF RACHEL PARKER.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of February 1918 the _Oxford Press_ carried the following:\r\n\r\nThe death on Monday in Oxford of Rachel Parker Wesley, an aged colored\r\nwoman, recalls an incident of the slavery times previous to the War of\r\nthe Rebellion, in which Rachel was a principal figure. The question of\r\nslavery was paramount then, and later became one of the burning issues\r\nof the war. Maryland was a slave State, and an ablebodied negro man\r\nwas worth in the slave market as much as $1400, while a girl often\r\nbrought $1000. Frequently negroes were taken from the free State of\r\nPennsylvania across into Maryland, where they might be sold.\r\n\r\nRachel Parker lived at the time with the family of Joseph Miller, on\r\nthe farm in West Nottingham now owned by S. S. Boyd.\r\n\r\nIt was on the last day of December, 1850, that she was kidnapped from\r\nthis home by three men, Thomas McCrery, John Merritt and George\r\nAlexander, the latter figuring as the driver of the wagon. It was\r\nabout 11 o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe team took a road, now vacated, that led to old Pine Grove school\r\nhouse. They found the road blocked by the wagon of James Pollock, and\r\nhis son Samuel, who were loading wood. On demand that the wagon be\r\nremoved so that they could pass at once, James Pollock refused, and\r\nwhen McCrery drew a sword he brandished his axe.\r\n\r\nThe kidnappers then turned and made their way to Nottingham, and by\r\nway of Stubbs' Mill, Chrome and Calvert, proceeded to Perryville, from\r\nwhich point they entrained for Baltimore.\r\n\r\nWhen the capture of Rachel Parker became known there was considerable\r\nexcitement in the community. Rachel was born of free parents and that\r\nshe had been carried away into possible slavery was too much for the\r\nsturdy abolitionists of that day.\r\n\r\nA party of eight was organized to go in pursuit. They were Joseph\r\nMiller, William Morris, Samuel Pollock, Lewis Melrath, Jesse B. Kirk,\r\nAbner B. Richardson, Benjamin Furniss, H. G. Coates.\r\n\r\nThese men went to Perryville and that night took a train for\r\nBaltimore. They went to a house of detention or slave pen in that city\r\nwhere runaway slaves were kept. While they were there McCrery appeared\r\nwith Rachel Parker in a wagon.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanians protested that the girl was not a slave, but was\r\nfree, and the authorities ordered that she be held and given a trial.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvanians met an acquaintance named Francis Cochran, who\r\nresided in Baltimore. When he learned their errand he told them they\r\nwere in mortal danger, and advised them to get at once on a train and\r\nnot leave it until they arrived at Perryville.\r\n\r\nJoseph Miller left the car, or the train, and was not seen again by\r\nhis friends, although search was made for him. His body was found some\r\nhours afterwards, hanging in a woods near Stemmer's Run. Just how he\r\nmet his death is a mystery that never was made clear. It was claimed\r\nat the time that investigation proved that Miller was dead before his\r\nbody was hanged to the tree, and that he had been poisoned.\r\n\r\nRachel Parker was gone more than 14 months, most of that time locked\r\nup in Baltimore. Her trial was postponed from time to time.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed in Baltimore that Rachel Parker was a member of a\r\nfamily named Crocus, and that they were runaway slaves. In an effort\r\nto prove this, people were sent to this neighborhood to try to\r\nidentify other members of the Parker family as in reality belonging to\r\nthe Crocus family. The attorney who ably defended Rachel Parker was\r\nLloyd Norris. She was acquitted, and she is said to have been the only\r\nperson so freed in a slave State.\r\n\r\nFor more than 40 years Rachel lived with the Coates family, near\r\nGlenroy. To Granville Coates, Sr., _The Press_ is indebted for the\r\ndetails of the affair, which are from records which he has faithfully\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of February, 1918 the _Oxford Press_ carried the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nThe account of the death in Oxford of Rachel Parker Wesley, an aged\r\ncolored woman, in last week's _Oxford Press_, has been closely read.\r\nSome older citizens, in town and country, recall the circumstances and\r\nthe high excitement that prevailed at the time Rachel Parker, then a\r\ngirl, was kidnapped.\r\n\r\nOf all the men who desired that justice be done Rachel Parker, who was\r\nkidnapped by Thomas McCrery and others on the last day of 1851, from\r\nthe home of Joseph C. Miller, West Nottingham, township, not one took\r\ndeeper and more determined interest in the matter than the late Dr.\r\nJohn Miller Dickey of Oxford. He became a leader in the affair and\r\nrepeatedly went to Baltimore, where Rachel was in jail, and got a\r\nnumber of the most influential citizens of Baltimore interested to\r\nhave justice brought about. The late Levi K. Brown of Lancaster county\r\nwas also active in the matter and rendered much valuable assistance.\r\n\r\nThe matter had now become so generally known that effectual help was\r\nreceived from the late Senator Henry S. Evans, West Chester, who\r\nbrought the circumstances to the attention of our Legislature, by\r\nwhich means the case became a State affair.\r\n\r\nDr. Dickey and others attended the trial in January, 1853. The\r\nproceedings lasted eight days, during which, as one of the claimant's\r\nattorneys expressed it, \"an entire neighborhood\" appeared and \"an\r\navalanche of testimony\" was borne to the girl's free birth. Evidence\r\nwas produced from Baltimore that she was not the girl who had been\r\nlost. Forty-nine witnesses were heard and many more were ready when a\r\ncompromise was proposed and agreed to. Notwithstanding this\r\noverwhelming evidence, there was still some fear that a Baltimore jury\r\nwould decide against the girl, and it was thought wise to give way.\r\nThe chief end was gained: Rachel Parker was declared free born; the\r\nsame jury gave a verdict also for her sister Elizabeth who had been\r\nfound in New Orleans and brought North, and the two were restored to\r\ntheir mother.\r\n\r\nThe costs of the trial were divided, these amounting to $1000, besides\r\n$3000 expended by the State of Pennsylvania and heavy outlays by\r\nfriendly citizens of Baltimore and Chester County.\r\n\r\nJudge Bell of West Chester, one of the Pennsylvania counsel, wrote\r\nthus after all was over to the West Chester _Republican and Democrat_:\r\n\r\n\"Too much praise cannot be accorded to the host of witnesses from\r\nChester County and the neighboring districts, who promptly on the call\r\nof justice and humanity, exchanged the comforts of home for the\r\ninconvenience and supposed dangers of sojourn in a strange city, under\r\ncircumstances well calculated to deter a merely selfish person from\r\nobeying the summons. This praise is peculiarly due to the numerous\r\nladies of our county whose sense of right overcame every merely\r\npersonal consideration.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"supposed dangers\" referred to, of which the murder of Joseph C.\r\nMiller was a sign, were realized by Dr. Dickey, who his son, the late\r\nJ. M. C. Dickey, Esq., told, \"would go to trial in Baltimore, not\r\nknowing how he would come back. Once he was very near death at their\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nThe concluding local action of this case of wide agitation was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nWest Nottingham, Jan. 17, 1853.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the witnesses and others who attended the Court of\r\nBaltimore county, in the case of the girls, Rachel and Elizabeth\r\nParker, the following was passed:\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas, By the blessings of Divine Providence, the two girls\r\n     Rachel and Elizabeth Parker, have been restored to the State of\r\n     Pennsylvania, where they were threatened, by a lawless and unjust\r\n     removal; and whereas, similar cases are likely to occur, and in\r\n     the excited state of public opinion on the subject of Slavery,\r\n     both in the Northern and Southern States, difficulties exist in\r\n     the way of the administration of law and justice where colored\r\n     persons are petitioning for their freedom, we regard it as a duty\r\n     we owe to those who may be engaged in similar prosecutions, as\r\n     well as to those who have mainly aided in obtaining success in\r\n     this case to put upon record the following resolutions:\r\n\r\n     \"That we regard with great satisfaction the conduct of the\r\n     Executive of our State, who, at the suggestion of the Senator and\r\n     Representatives of our county, assumed the control and\r\n     responsibilities of the trial; and that we tender our sincere\r\n     thanks to the distinguished counsel, Attorney-General Campbell\r\n     and Judge Bell, who visited at different times this place to\r\n     become familiar with and to give encouragement to the witnesses\r\n     to about to testify in another State, thus accomplishing the\r\n     object as well by their urbanity as well as by their professional\r\n     skill.\r\n\r\n     \"That we express our sincere acknowledgement of the courtesy\r\n     shown us by the Court of Baltimore county, both by the bench and\r\n     bar and especially to Wm. H. Norris, Esq., for his invaluable\r\n     services, associated as counsel with those from our own State.\r\n\r\n     \"That we deplore the death of Joseph C. Miller, a witness in the\r\n     first trial before the magistrate's court, and believing, as we\r\n     most positively do, that he came to his death violently by other\r\n     hands than his own, we implore the Executive to offer a suitable\r\n     reward, in addition to that offered by his friends, for the\r\n     discovery and apprehension of his murderers.\r\n\r\n                              JOHN M. DICKEY,\r\n                                            _Chairman_.\"\r\n                              HUGH ROWLAND, _Secretary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be added that the Grand Jury of Chester county brought in a\r\ntrue bill against Thomas McCrery and Merritt, his associate, for\r\nkidnapping. But Governor Lowe of Maryland refused the requisition for\r\napprehension and delivery, going behind the record, contrary to the\r\nlaw, as Governor Bigler of Pennsylvania demonstrated clearly in the\r\npublished correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OHIO NEGRO PIONEERS\r\n\r\nIn 1835 some of the earnest free colored people of Virginia were\r\ninterested in reports of the great opportunities for colored folk in\r\nthe State of Ohio, so often called the Buckeye State. At that time\r\nthere were no railroads from the slave State Virginia to Ohio, a free\r\nState. But the determined freemen and their families undeterred by\r\nthis drawback went forth in covered wagon trains.\r\n\r\nOne of the earlier groups of pioneers consisted of several families\r\nfrom and near Richmond Virginia; namely, Abraham Depp and his wife\r\nMary Goode-Depp, Elias Litchford, James Poindexter, and Archer Goode,\r\nwith their families, and Samuel Willis Whyte accompanied by his son\r\nbearing the same name, all of whom settled in central Ohio, not far\r\nfrom Columbus. Abraham Depp purchased five or six hundred acres, south\r\nof Delaware; Litchford about the same number of acres nearer Columbus;\r\nthe elder Whyte, being a mechanic, purchased only about two hundred\r\nacres. Samuel W. Whyte Jr. later left his trade for the profession of\r\nmedicine and became noted as a specialist of chronic diseases. Dr.\r\nSamuel Whyte married Miss Louisa Goode, daughter of Archer Goode. She\r\nwas of a peculiar sweet disposition, a model companion, and a loving\r\nearnest mother. She as often called Saint Louisa by those who knew her\r\nbest. She died in 1905.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor always kept in touch with the leading thoughts and\r\nachievements of his day. He was a brilliant scholar, a great logician,\r\nwith a keen wit, having a dash of eccentricity throughout; in fact, he\r\nwas a born philosopher, and a man of many parts. He was educated for\r\nmissionary work to Liberia, but he remained at home and became one of\r\nthe landmarks of Central Ohio in politics and medicine. He was born in\r\n1815 and died in 1902, when, as it happened in the case of his wife\r\nwhom he survived seven years, he was borne to his final resting place\r\nfrom the home where he had lived since 1835. Dr. Whyte and his wife\r\nhad a large family of whom the writer, H. Georgiana Whyte, alone bears\r\nthe family name. The old homestead is retained by the descendents.\r\n\r\nAll through Ohio settled many such high minded, thoroughgoing\r\nChristian Negro families that helped to build up Ohio and left large\r\nfamilies, of worthy descendants. Of this pioneer group one of the most\r\nprominent characters was James Poindexter, who sold his farm of forty\r\nacres and went to Columbus, Ohio to live. He was a playmate and always\r\nan ardent friend of Dr. Samuel Willis Whyte, Jr. There James\r\nPoindexter became a Baptist minister and during later years became one\r\nof the foremost citizens of Columbus, having become a member of the\r\ncity council and for over forty years served as pastor of the most\r\nprominent Baptist church in the city. He was in great demand as an\r\norator before and after the Civil War. He lived to a ripe old age.\r\n\r\n                                             H. GEORGIANA WHYTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALEXANDERS\r\n\r\nHenry Alexander a mulatto who lived at Mayslick, Kentucky, and who\r\npurchased his freedom when twenty-one years of age, sent his two\r\noldest daughters to school in Philadelphia as early as 1846. He was a\r\nstore-keeper and grain merchant. In the fifties he sent three younger\r\nones to Oberlin, Ohio where Louisa Alexander was graduated in 1862.\r\nShe and her older sister Rachel taught in the South during the\r\nReconstruction period and had many thrilling experiences. In several\r\ninstances their schools were closed and they were given so many hours\r\nto leave town. Maria Ann, who went to school in Philadelphia, taught a\r\nwhile in Covington, Kentucky, strange as it may seem, before the war.\r\nShe was later married to the late Judge Mifflin W. Gibbs, an\r\nunflinching advocate of human rights.\r\n\r\n                                             Q. G. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK REVIEWS\r\n\r\n\r\n     _The Correspondence of Robert M. T. Hunter_, 1826-1876, Volume\r\n     II. Edited by CHARLES HENRY AMBLER. Washington, 1918. Pp. 381.\r\n\r\nThis comprises the twelfth report of the Historical Manuscript\r\nCommission and is published as the Annual Report of the American\r\nHistorical Association for the year 1916. The contents are a callendar\r\nof papers and addresses by Robert M. T. Hunter heretofore printed, a\r\ncallendar of letters to and from him printed in this volume, and the\r\ncorrespondence of the statesman. The work of the author appears to be\r\nmore of that of a collector than that of an editor, for the volume has\r\nvery little annotation. In the short preface the author undertakes to\r\ngive the place of Robert M. T. Hunter in the history of his State and\r\nof the nation and to evaluate his correspondence. The excuse for such\r\na short sketch is that Robert M. T. Hunter did not stand out as a\r\ngreat statesman himself but owes his importance to following the\r\nleadership of John C. Calhoun, and the period in which he lived was\r\none of declining influence for his State and later one of civil strife\r\nbetween the great sections of the nation. Although he served the\r\npublic almost continuously during the period of thirty years he held\r\nonly a few positions of trust, most of his service being in the United\r\nStates Senate.\r\n\r\nThese letters, as a whole, are unusually valuable in that they throw\r\nlight on various problems perplexing the country during this critical\r\nperiod of American history between the year 1826 and 1876. Students of\r\nNegro history will be primarily interested in the letters in which we\r\nfind mention of the African trade with Brazil, his speeches on\r\nslavery, on the fight for Missouri and Kansas, and on the abolition\r\nmovement. His correspondence shows, moreover, what he thought about\r\nthe extension of slavery, the stealing of slaves, legislation\r\nregarding the institution, and the power of Congress in the\r\nterritories. There are references to the Compromise of 1850, the\r\nexecution of the Fugitive Slave Law, the struggle in Kansas, and the\r\ndemands of the South in the great crisis. The space which he gives to\r\nthe opinions and the doctrines advanced by Stephen A. Douglas, the\r\nrights of the slave States in the territories, the attitude of\r\nSeward, and the election of 1860 is considerable.\r\n\r\nAs Robert M. T. Hunter lived to see the Reconstruction worked out, it\r\nis interesting to note his attitude on the part he felt that the Negro\r\nshould play in it. He did not believe that the elevation of the Negro\r\nto the status of citizenship with the right to vote or hold office\r\nwould be good for this country. He referred frequently to the\r\nexperience of Negro governments in Haiti and Jamaica to support his\r\ntheory. He felt that it would result in the formation of the black\r\nman's party which would persecute the white man and the Negro control\r\nof affairs would result in the destruction of all the elements of\r\nmaterial prosperity and moral progress. He believed that, as it\r\nhappened in these islands, the black man's party would so persecute\r\nthe whites that they would be driven from the country, just as the\r\nHaitians had persecuted the whites and made it illegal for them to\r\nhold real estate in the island. Even if the Negroes did get control of\r\nthe Southern States and persecute the whites in the way that he\r\nsuspected that they would, it would only be a matter of time before\r\nthe North would rise up against the blacks thus exalted and overthrow\r\nthem. Hunter disclaimed any hostility toward the Negroes but insisted\r\nthat their welfare was to be promoted in a way that was contrary to\r\ntheir own future plans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Finding a Way Out._ By ROBERT RUSSA MOTON, An Autobiography.\r\n     Doubleday, Page and Company, New York, 1920. Pp. 295.\r\n\r\nThis story, according to the author, was written because of the\r\nrepeated and urgent solicitation of those of his friends believing\r\nthat such a story would serve an essential purpose in helping to a\r\nclearer understanding of the hopes and aspirations of the Negro and\r\nthe difficulties which they have had to overcome. The author has\r\nendeavored to record these events which have given character and color\r\nto his life and at the same time to reflect the impressions made upon\r\nhis mind by experiences that he could not always reconcile with what\r\nhe had learned of American ideals and standards.\r\n\r\nThe story begins with an interesting account of the coming of the\r\nancestors of Dr. Moton out of Africa to serve in the new world. There\r\nis a short sketch of early life on the Virginia plantation where his\r\nparents first connected themselves with America, covering the\r\nboy-hood, early training and first impressions of the author of this\r\nwork. The chapter treating of the Reconstruction period, when as a\r\nyouth the author was seeking an education and had to withstand the\r\ntemptation of being drawn into the inviting political world of these\r\ndays of a seeming golden age, adds increasing interest. Following this\r\nthere appears an account of his career at Hampton in the connection\r\nwith General Armstrong as an outstanding figure of inspiration and\r\nlove. How the author at the close of his student days solved the\r\nproblem of the choice of a life work and became a leader among the\r\nblack, the white, and the red, brings the reader to the consideration\r\nof actual achievement. Serving Hampton as a representative travelling\r\nthrough the North and the South, Dr. Moton found his way into larger\r\nfields of usefulness by touching the life of the Negro in all of its\r\nramifications.\r\n\r\nThe close connection between Dr. Moton and Dr. Booker T. Washington\r\nwhom he succeeded, is made the important feature of the book. The\r\ncomradeship of these two men and their cooperation in a common cause\r\nstand out as eloquent facts leading the way to the choice of Dr. Moton\r\nas the successor of his great friend at Tuskegee. In this he states\r\nhow he has taken up this unusually hard task and solved the problems\r\nwhich have come his way. The calls upon him for service in other\r\nfields requiring his time in all matters touching the uplift of the\r\nNegro race show an enlarging usefulness of the man. Among these\r\nefforts may be mentioned the work in connection with the National\r\nUrban League, the Young Men's Christian Association, the war work\r\nmovements, and his mission to the colored soldiers in France after the\r\nwar. On the whole, this story of the direct descendant of an African\r\nbrought to a tobacco plantation and finally rising to a position of\r\nusefulness and honor, is of much value. It not only throws light on\r\nthe history of that group of which he formed a part in a State\r\nconsidered one of the most important in the Union, but served also as\r\na striking example of the ability of the Negro in spite of all of the\r\nhandicaps against which he must struggle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Unwritten History._ By BISHOP L. J. COPPIN. The A. M. E. Book\r\n     Concern, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1920. Pp. 375.\r\n\r\nHere we have under this peculiar caption the auto-biography of a man\r\nwho for a number of years has figured very largely in the African\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church. In his preface he says that, intermingled\r\nwith this unwritten history, is the story of his life. He frankly\r\nstates that it is all from memory with the exception of a number of\r\nverifications. The effort toward a thorough biography has not been the\r\nobjective of the author, for as he states he has merely written down\r\nthose things that impressed him most and facts that seem to him the\r\nmost significant among the things to be noted.\r\n\r\nThe work begins with an account of his birth and boyhood in Frederick\r\nTown on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where Frederick Douglas was\r\nborn. There is much information about the life of Frederick Town\r\nreferring to particular places along the rivers and bays and various\r\npersons who figured in the life of these people. Bishop Coppin directs\r\nattention to the social, moral and intellectual condition of the State\r\nat the time of his birth, giving full account of the religious\r\natmosphere in which he lived and the particular strivings of his\r\noppressed people.\r\n\r\nLeaving this phase of the story one finds the book more interesting in\r\nthat part discussing the events leading up to the Civil War and the\r\nrole which the Negroes played in that drama. The sketch of the\r\nsituation after the Civil War is equally well set forth because of the\r\nincreasing power of the author during this period to appreciate and\r\nparticipate in the larger things which concerned the Negro people. His\r\ncall to the ministry, service in various fields and the election to\r\nthe bishopric add further interest to the story. How in his travels in\r\nthis country and abroad men and things impressed him, constitute\r\nanother value of the autobiography. The book closes with a chapter\r\ngiving a view of the domestic life of Bishop Coppin, making honorable\r\nmention of his family.\r\n\r\nFor the popular reader this book may appear to be distinctly rough in\r\nstyle and certain details may prove to be tiresome in that the author\r\nomitted a good many things that some persons might want to learn and\r\ndrifted into those things which, by the average reader, may not be\r\nconsidered worth while. On the whole, however, the scientific student\r\nwill find this autobiography just what it is entitled, _Unwritten\r\nHistory_. Here is an opportunity to learn of the struggles of a Negro\r\nduring the period of great handicap and to understand his reaction to\r\nwhat was going on in the world about him. It will be from such\r\nbiographies that some one in the future will have to write an actual\r\nhistory of the Negro race to set forth exactly what this group has\r\nthought and felt and done. A book of this sort, therefore, must have a\r\nvalue. It is to be hoped that other distinguished churchmen and\r\nNegroes who have thus touched the life of the race will emulate the\r\nexample of Bishop Coppin in leaving a written record.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Negro Migration during the War._ By EMMETT J. SCOTT,\r\n     Secretary-Treasurer of Howard University. Oxford University\r\n     Press, New York, 1920. Pp. 189.\r\n\r\nUnder the imprint of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,\r\nand the Editorship of Professor Kinley, Mr. Emmett J. Scott has\r\nbrought out a monograph study of Negro Migration during the War, based\r\nupon the careful and wisely distributed observation and records of\r\nseveral collaborative agents and agencies. The subject is of too great\r\nand too immediate economic and social importance to have waited for\r\nthe final interpretation as to results or the finer analysis as to\r\ncauses which must ultimately be given it. The entire series, in fact,\r\nmodestly styles itself a series of preliminary economic studies; and\r\nas such, Volume XVI presents a sanely proportioned, clearly expounded,\r\nand systematic survey of the vital and outstanding facts of one of the\r\nmost significant movements in the recent economic life of America.\r\n\r\nProfounder consequences may ensue from this movement of the Negro\r\npopulation, which, though started by war conditions, has by no means\r\nhalted with the war, than can be realized on superficial observation.\r\nIn this light, Mr. Scott's diagnosis is as important as his chronicle\r\nof the facts. The reaction of the Negro masses away from untoward and\r\nrepressing social conditions and their awakening to the simple but\r\neffective expedient of carrying their labor to better markets, are the\r\nsignificantly new features of the after-war aspects of the Negro\r\nproblem. Economic adjustment, in most respects automatic--and\r\nfortunately so--would be the controlling factor were there not\r\nconsiderable evidence to show that the efficient causes of the\r\nmovement are social. In which case, as the concluding chapter\r\nsuggests, better living conditions, a more liberal social attitude,\r\nimproved interracial feeling will prove to be the only stabilizing\r\nremedy. That the South has awakened to the realization of this, and is\r\nabout to apply to the situation more constructive and well-intentioned\r\neffort than hitherto, is the confident belief and optimistic message\r\nof the writer.\r\n\r\nReactions and effects of the Exodus upon northern community conditions\r\nhave not been gone into as thoroughly as the reactions upon conditions\r\nin the South; though there is evidence pointing on the whole to\r\nsalutary effects in both sections. Certainly the study serves to call\r\ntimely attention without undue alarmist effect to very momentous\r\nchanges, and should be read by every alert, public-minded citizen.\r\n\r\nIn such delicate issues, however, facts outweigh opinions. Mr. Scott\r\nhas wisely struck the balance in favor of a dispassionate recital of\r\nfacts. It is a positive gain and welcome change of tone in the recent\r\ndiscussion of racial issues to note in this study, as in Carl\r\nSandburg's _Chicago Riots_, the growing tendency to be objective and\r\nto leave conclusions to the intelligence of one's readers. Indeed,\r\nsince it is facts that are of paramount interest, it is regrettable\r\nthat, with the great resources of the foundation, more explicit\r\nstatistics concerning the movement could not have been compiled. It is\r\nthis aspect of the subject which in consequence calls for further\r\ntreatment. Without the scientific pretensions, therefore, of Mr.\r\nEpstein's intensive study of the Negro migrant or Dr. Woodson's\r\nhistorical survey, the book, as a capable popular treatment of the\r\npublic questions and social issues involved in the recent migration of\r\nthe Negro population, serves its own distinctive purpose, and achieves\r\na measure of real public service.\r\n\r\n                                             ALAIN LOCKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th and 19th of November the Association for the Study of\r\nNegro Life and History will hold its annual meeting in Washington.\r\nThis will be a convocation of teachers and scholars throughout the\r\nUnited States, now giving attention to research and instruction in\r\nthis field. The management of the Association is endeavoring to make\r\nthis meeting one of the most representative ever assembled.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the meeting is to promote the collection of\r\nsociological and historical documents, to stimulate studies in this\r\nfield through clubs and schools, and finally to bring about more\r\nharmony between the races by interpreting the one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the work accomplished by the Association during the\r\npast year will be made, further plans for the more successful\r\nprosecution of the work will be devised and a number of instructive\r\naddresses will be delivered by some of the most distinguished men of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nAmong the speakers will be A. B. Hart, Professor of History at Harvard\r\nUniversity, Franz Boas, Professor of Ethnology at Columbia University,\r\nL. Hollingsworth Wood, President of the Urban League, and Oswald\r\nGarrison Villard, the Editor of the _Nation_. These addresses will\r\ncover almost every phase of Negro life and history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree important works bearing on the Negro have recently come from the\r\npress. Among these are _The Voice of the Negro_, by Robert T. Kerlin,\r\nProfessor of English, Virginia Military Institute, published by E. P.\r\nDutton and Company, New York; _The Negro Faces America_, by Herbert J.\r\nSeligman, formerly a member of the editorial staff of the _New York\r\nEvening Times_ and the _New Republic_, published by Harper and\r\nBrothers, New York; and the _Republic of Liberia_, being a general\r\ndescription of the Negro republic with its history, commerce,\r\nagriculture, flora and fauna, and present methods of administration,\r\nby R. C. F. Maugham, Consul General at Monrovia, published by Charles\r\nScribner's Sons, New York. Reviews of these books will appear in the\r\nnext number of the _Journal of Negro History_.\r\n\r\n_The United States in Our Times, 1865-1920_, by Paul L. Haworth, is\r\nthe title of a work recently brought out by Charles Scribner's Sons.\r\nCovering the period during which the Negroes have had a chance to play\r\na part in freedom, it contains some information and comment which will\r\nbe mentioned in this publication.\r\n\r\nDuring the academic year 1920-1921 Dr. C. G. Woodson will, in the\r\ncapacity of Dean, reorganize the College Department of the West\r\nVirginia Collegiate Institute. He will endeavor to finish this work\r\nduring one or two years, at the expiration of which he plans to devote\r\nall of his time to research and publication. This new task of the\r\nDirector will not necessitate any change in the management of the\r\nJournal of Negro History. The editorial office will remain in\r\nWashington as formerly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as\r\npossible, including obsolete and variant spellings and other\r\ninconsistencies.\r\n\r\nThe transcriber noted the following issues and made changes as\r\nindicated to the text to correct obvious errors:\r\n\r\n   1. p.   6, Duplicate footnote markers for footnote #20\r\n   2. p.  30, beseiged --> besieged\r\n   3. p.  60, heriditary --> hereditary\r\n   4. p.  67, Duplicate footnote markers for footnote #6\r\n   5. p.  68, not the case. --> not the case.\"\r\n   6. p.  70, No footnote marker for footnote #9.\r\n   7. p.  71, Multiple footnote markers for footnote #10\r\n   8. p.  71,72, Multiple footnote markers for footnote #11\r\n   9. p.  72,73, Multiple footnote markers for footnote #12\r\n  10. p.  76, No footnote marker for footnote #14.\r\n  11. p.  82, No footnote marker for footnote #21.\r\n  12. p.  89, Convenion --> Convention\r\n  13. p. 104, Gleaves --> Gleaves,\r\n  14. p. 104, Thomas --> Thomas,\r\n  15. p. 115, Misisssippi --> Mississippi\r\n  16. p. 121, goverenment --> government\r\n  17. p. 124, He said: There --> He said: \"There\r\n  18. p. 184, chieflly --> chiefly\r\n  19. p. 187, esitmate --> estimate\r\n  20. p. 194, serivce --> service\r\n  21. p. 223, Footnote #30, Drewery -->Drewry\r\n  22. p. 243, Leglistature --> Legislature\r\n  23. p. 263, Sign&eacute;) --> (Sign&eacute;)\r\n  24. p. 273, Footnote #5, Loftt --> Lofft\r\n  25. p. 273, Footnote #10, Holdworth's --> Holdsworth's\r\n  26. p. 276, Longueil --> Longueuil\r\n  27. p. 277, Two footnote markers #15 are found on page 277.
