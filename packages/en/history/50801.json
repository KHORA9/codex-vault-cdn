We later found different spheres in the world;\r\nand you came back to Cambridge in due time to assume your high office.\r\nTwelve years ago, sought by you, I likewise came, to discharge a duty\r\nunder you._\r\n\r\n_You took me away from many cares, and transferred me to the more\r\ncongenial service of the University. The change has conduced to the\r\nprogress of those studies in which I hardly remember to have had a lack\r\nof interest._\r\n\r\n_So I owe much to you; and it is not, I trust, surprising that I desire\r\nto connect, in this work, your name with that of your_\r\n\r\n_Obliged friend_,\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CONTENTS AND ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n  [_The cut on the title represents a mask, which forms the centre of\r\n  the Mexican Calendar Stone, as engraved in D.

AMERICANA IN LIBRARIES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIES.\r\n\r\nHARRISSE, in the Introduction of his _Bibliotheca Americana\r\nVetustissima_, enumerates and characterizes many of the bibliographies\r\nof Americana, beginning with the chapter, “De Scriptoribus rerum\r\nAmericanarum,” in the _Bibliotheca Classica_ of Draudius, in 1622.[1]\r\nDe Laet, in his _Nieuwe Wereldt_ (1625), gives a list of about\r\nthirty-seven authorities, which he increased somewhat in later\r\neditions.[2] The earliest American catalogue of any moment, however,\r\ncame from a native Peruvian, Léon y Pinelo, who is usually cited by the\r\nlatter name only. He had prepared an extensive list; but he published\r\nat Madrid, in 1629, a selection of titles only, under the designation\r\nof _Epitome de la biblioteca oriental i occidental_,[3] which included\r\nmanuscripts as well as books. He had exceptional advantages as\r\nchronicler of the Indies.\r\n\r\nIn 1671, in Montanus’s _Nieuwe weereld_, and in Ogilby’s _America_,\r\nabout 167 authorities are enumerated.\r\n\r\nSabin[4] refers to Cornelius van Beughem’s _Bibliographia Historica_,\r\n1685, published at Amsterdam, as having the titles of books on America.\r\n\r\nThe earliest exclusively American catalogue is the _Bibliothecæ\r\nAmericanæ Primordia_ of White Kennett,[5] Bishop of Peterborough,\r\npublished in London in 1713. The arrangement of its sixteen hundred\r\nentries is chronological; and it enters under their respective dates\r\nthe sections of such collections as Hakluyt and Ramusio.[6] It\r\nparticularly pertains to the English colonies, and more especially to\r\nNew England, where, in the eighteenth century, three distinctively\r\nvaluable American libraries are known to have existed,—that of the\r\nMather family, which was in large part destroyed during the battle\r\nof Bunker Hill, in 1775; that of Thomas Prince, still in large part\r\nexisting in the Boston Public Library; and that of Governor Hutchinson,\r\nscattered by the mob which attacked his house in Boston in 1765.[7]\r\n\r\nIn 1716 Lenglet du Fresnoy inserted a brief list (sixty titles) in his\r\n_Méthode pour étudier la géographie_. Garcia’s _Origen de los Indias de\r\nel nuevo mundo_, Madrid, 1729, shows a list of about seventeen hundred\r\nauthors.[8]\r\n\r\nIn 1737-1738 Barcia enlarged Pinelo’s work, translating all his titles\r\ninto Spanish, and added numerous other entries which Rich[9] says were\r\n“clumsily thrown together.”\r\n\r\nCharlevoix prefixed to his _Nouvelle France_, in 1744, a list with\r\nuseful comments, which the English reader can readily approach in\r\nDr. Shea’s translation. A price-list which has been preserved of the\r\nsale in Paris in 1764, _Catalogue des livres des ci-devant soi-disans\r\nJésuites du Collége de Clermont_, indicates the lack of competition at\r\nthat time for those choicer Americana, now so costly.[10] The _Regio\r\npatronatu Indiarum_ of Frassus (1775) gives about 1505 authorities.\r\nThere is a chronological catalogue of books issued in the American\r\ncolonies previous to 1775, prepared by S. F. Haven, Jr., and appended\r\nto the edition of Thomas’s _History of Printing_, published by the\r\nAmerican Antiquarian Society. Though by no means perfect, it is a\r\nconvenient key to most publications illustrative of American history\r\nduring the colonial period of the English possessions, and printed in\r\nAmerica. Dr. Robertson’s _America_ (1777) shows only 250 works, and it\r\nindicates how far short he was of the present advantages in the study\r\nof this subject. Clavigero surpassed all his predecessors in the lists\r\naccompanying his _Storia del Messico_, published in 1780,—but the\r\nspecial bibliography of Mexico is examined elsewhere. Equally special,\r\nand confined to the English colonies, is the documentary register\r\nwhich Jefferson inserted in his _Notes on Virginia_; but it serves to\r\nshow how scanty the records were a hundred years ago compared with the\r\ncalendars of such material now. Meuzel, in 1782, had published enough\r\nof his _Bibliotheca Historica_ to cover the American field, though he\r\nnever completed the work as planned.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 an anonymous _Bibliotheca Americana_ of nearly sixteen hundred\r\nentries was published in London. It is not of much value. Harrisse\r\nand others attribute it to Reid; but by some the author’s name is\r\ndifferently given as Homer, Dalrymple, and Long.[11]\r\n\r\nAn enumeration of the documentary sources (about 152 entries) used by\r\nMuñoz in his _Historia del nuevo mundo_ (1793) is given in Fustér’s\r\n_Biblioteca Valenciana_ (ii. 202-234) published at Valencia in\r\n1827-1830.[12]\r\n\r\nThere is in the Library of Congress (Force Collection) a copy of an\r\n_Indice de la Coleccion de manuscritos pertinecientes a la historia de\r\nlas Indias_, by Fraggia, Abella, and others, dated at Madrid, 1799.[13]\r\n\r\nIn the Sparks collection at Cornell are two other manuscript\r\nbibliographies worthy of notice. One is a _Biblioteca Americana_, by\r\nAntonio de Alcedo, dated in 1807. Sparks says his copy was made in 1843\r\nfrom an original which Obadiah Rich had found in Madrid.[14]\r\n\r\nHarrisse says that another copy is in the Carter-Brown Library; and\r\nhe asserts that, excepting some additions of modern American authors,\r\nit is not much improved over Barcia’s edition of Pinelo. H. H.\r\nBancroft[15] mentions having a third copy, which had formerly belonged\r\nto Prescott.\r\n\r\nThe other manuscript at Cornell is a _Bibliotheca Americana_, prepared\r\nin twelve volumes by Arthur Homer, who had intended, but never\r\naccomplished, the publication of it. Sparks found it in Sir Thomas\r\nPhillipps’s library at Middlehill, and caused the copy of it to be\r\nmade, which is now at Ithaca.[16]\r\n\r\nIn 1808 Boucher de la Richarderie published at Paris his _Bibliothèque\r\nuniverselle des voyages_,[17] which has in the fifth part a critical\r\nlist of all voyages to American waters. Harrisse disagrees with Peignot\r\nin his favorable estimate of Richarderie, and traces to him the errors\r\nof Faribault and later bibliographers.\r\n\r\nThe _Bibliotheca Hispano-Americana_ of Dr. José Mariano Beristain de\r\nSouza was published in Mexico in 1816-1821, in three volumes. Quaritch,\r\npricing it at £96 in 1880, calls it the rarest and most valuable of\r\nall American bibliographical works. It is a notice of writers who were\r\nborn, educated, or flourished in Spanish America, and naturally covers\r\nmuch of interest to the historical student. The author did not live to\r\ncomplete it, and his nephew finished it.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 Colonel Israel Thorndike, of Boston, bought for $6,500 the\r\nAmerican library of Professor Ebeling, of Germany, estimated to contain\r\nover thirty-two hundred volumes, besides an extraordinary collection\r\nof ten thousand maps.[18] The library was given by the purchaser to\r\nHarvard College, and its possession at once put the library of that\r\ninstitution at the head of all libraries in the United States for the\r\nillustration of American history. No catalogue of it was ever printed,\r\nexcept as a part of the General Catalogue of the College Library issued\r\nin 1830-1834, in five volumes.\r\n\r\nAnother useful collection of Americana added to the same library was\r\nthat formed by David B. Warden, for forty years United States Consul at\r\nParis, who printed a catalogue of its twelve hundred volumes at Paris,\r\nin 1820, called _Bibliotheca Americo-Septentrionalis_. The collection\r\nin 1823 found a purchaser at $5,000, in Mr. Samuel A. Eliot, who gave\r\nit to the College.[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EBELING.[20]]\r\n\r\nThe Harvard library, however, as well as several of the best\r\ncollections of Americana in the United States, owes more, perhaps, to\r\nObadiah Rich than to any other. This gentleman, a native of Boston,\r\nwas born in 1783. He went as consul of the United States to Valencia\r\nin 1815, and there began his study of early Spanish-American history,\r\nand undertook the gathering of a remarkable collection of books,[21]\r\nwhich he threw open generously, with his own kindly assistance, to\r\nevery investigator who visited Spain for purposes of study. Here he\r\nwon the respect of Alexander H. Everett, then American minister to\r\nthe court of Spain. He captivated Irving by his helpful nature, who\r\nsays of him: “Rich was one of the most indefatigable, intelligent, and\r\nsuccessful bibliographers in Europe. His house at Madrid was a literary\r\nwilderness, abounding with curious works and rare editions. ... He was\r\nwithal a man of great truthfulness and simplicity of character, of an\r\namiable and obliging disposition and strict integrity.” Similar was the\r\nestimation in which he was held by Ticknor, Prescott, George Bancroft,\r\nand many others, as Allibone has recorded.[22] In 1828 he removed\r\nto London, where he established himself as a bookseller. From this\r\nperiod, as Harrisse[23] fitly says, it was under his influence, acting\r\nupon the lovers of books among his compatriots, that the passion for\r\nforming collections of books exclusively American grew up.[24] In those\r\ndays the cost of books now esteemed rare was trifling compared with\r\nthe prices demanded at present. Rich had a prescience in his calling,\r\nand the beginnings of the great libraries of Colonel Aspinwall, Peter\r\nForce, James Lenox, and John Carter Brown were made under his fostering\r\neye; which was just as kindly vigilant for Grenville, who was then\r\nforming out of the income of his sinecure office the great collection\r\nwhich he gave to the British nation in recompense for his support.[25]\r\nIn London, watching the book-markets and making his catalogue, Rich\r\ncontinued to live for the rest of his life (he died in February, 1850),\r\nexcept for a period when he was the United States consul at Port\r\nMahon in the Balearic Islands. His bibliographies are still valuable,\r\nhis annotations in them are trustworthy, and their records are the\r\nstarting-points of the growth of prices. His issues and reissues of\r\nthem are somewhat complicated by supplements and combinations, but\r\ncollectors and bibliographers place them on their shelves in the\r\nfollowing order:\r\n\r\n1. _A Catalogue of books relating principally to America, arranged\r\nunder the years in which they were printed_ (1500-1700), London, 1832.\r\nThis included four hundred and eighty-six numbers, those designated\r\nby a star without price being understood to be in Colonel Aspinwall’s\r\ncollection. Two small supplements were added to this.\r\n\r\n2. _Bibliotheca Americana Nova, printed since 1700 (to 1800)_, London,\r\n1835. Two hundred and fifty copies were printed. A supplement appeared\r\nin 1841, and this became again a part of his.\r\n\r\n3. _Bibliotheca Americana Nova_, vol. i. (1701-1800); vol. ii.\r\n(1801-1844), which was printed (250 copies) in London in 1846.[26]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1833 that Colonel Thomas Aspinwall, of Boston, who was for\r\nthirty-eight years the American consul at London, printed at Paris\r\na catalogue of his collection of Americana, where seven hundred and\r\nseventy-one lots included, beside much that was ordinarily useful, a\r\ngreat number of the rarest of books on American history. Harrisse has\r\ncalled Colonel Aspinwall, not without justice, “a bibliophile of great\r\ntact and activity.” All but the rarest part of his collection was\r\nsubsequently burned in 1863, when it had passed into the hands of Mr.\r\nSamuel L. M. Barlow,[27] of New York.\r\n\r\nM. Ternaux-Compans, who had collected—as Mr. Brevoort thinks[28]—the\r\nmost extensive library of books on America ever brought together,\r\nprinted his _Bibliothèque Américaine_[29] in 1837 at Paris. It\r\nembraced 1,154 works, arranged chronologically, and all of them of a\r\ndate before 1700. The titles were abridged, and accompanied by French\r\ntranslations. His annotations were scant; and other students besides\r\nRich have regretted that so learned a man had not more benefited his\r\nfellow-students by ampler notes.[30]\r\n\r\nAlso in 1837 appeared the _Catalogue d’ouvrages sur l’histoire de\r\nl’Amérique_, of G. B. Faribault, which was published at Quebec, and was\r\nmore specially devoted to books on New France.[31]\r\n\r\nWith the works of Rich and Ternaux the bibliography of Americana\r\nmay be considered to have acquired a distinct recognition; and the\r\nsucceeding survey of this field may be more conveniently made if we\r\ngroup the contributors by some broad discriminations of the motives\r\ninfluencing them, though such distinctions sometimes become confluent.\r\n\r\nFirst, as regards what may be termed professional bibliography. One of\r\nthe earliest workers in the new spirit was a Dresden jurist, Hermann E.\r\nLudewig, who came to the United States in 1844, and prepared an account\r\nof the _Literature of American local history_, which was published in\r\n1846. This was followed by a supplement, pertaining wholly to New York\r\nState, which appeared in _The Literary World_, February 19, 1848. He\r\nhad previously published in the _Serapeum_ at Leipsic (1845, pp. 209)\r\naccounts of American libraries and bibliography, which were the first\r\ncontributions to this subject.[32] Some years later, in 1858, there\r\nwas published in London a monograph on _The Literature of the American\r\nAboriginal Linguistics_,[33] which had been undertaken by Mr. Ludewig\r\nbut had not been carried through the press, when he died, Dec. 12,\r\n1856.[34]\r\n\r\nWe owe to a Franco-American citizen the most important bibliography\r\nwhich we have respecting the first half century of American history;\r\nfor the _Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima_ only comes down to 1551\r\nin its chronological arrangement. Mr. Brevoort[35] very properly\r\ncharacterizes it as “a work which lightens the labors of such as have\r\nto investigate early American history.”[36]\r\n\r\nIt was under the hospitable roof of Mr. Barlow’s library in New York\r\nthat, “having gloated for years over second-hand compilations,”\r\nHarrisse says that he found himself “for the first time within reach\r\nof the fountain-heads of history.” Here he gathered the materials for\r\nhis _Notes on Columbus_, which were, as he says, like “pencil marks\r\nvarnished over.” These first appeared less perfectly than later, in\r\nthe _New York Commercial Advertiser_, under the title of “Columbus\r\nin a Nut-shell.” Mr. Harrisse had also prepared (four copies only\r\nprinted) for Mr. Barlow in 1864 the _Bibliotheca Barlowiana_, which is\r\na descriptive catalogue of the rarest books in the Barlow-Aspinwall\r\nCollection, touching especially the books on Virginian and New England\r\nhistory between 1602 and 1680.\r\n\r\nMr. Barlow now (1864) sumptuously printed the _Notes on Columbus_\r\nin a volume (ninety-nine copies) for private distribution. For some\r\nreason not apparent, there were expressions in this admirable treatise\r\nwhich offended some; as when, for instance (p. vii), he spoke of being\r\ndebarred the privileges of a much-vaunted public library, referring\r\nto the Astor Library. Similar inadvertences again brought him hostile\r\ncriticism, when two years later (1866) he printed with considerable\r\ntypographical luxury his _Bibliotheca Americana Vetustissima_, which\r\nwas published in New York. It embraces something over three hundred\r\nentries.[37] The work is not without errors; and Mr. Henry Stevens,\r\nwho claims that he was wrongly accused in the book, gave it a bad\r\nname in the _London Athenæum_ of Oct. 6, 1866, where an unfortunate\r\nslip, in making “Ander Schiffahrt”[38] a personage, is unmercifully\r\nridiculed. A committee of the Société de Géographie in Paris, of which\r\nM. Ernest Desjardins was spokesman, came to the rescue, and printed a\r\n_Rapport sur les deux ouvrages de bibliographie Américaine de M. Henri\r\nHarrisse_, Paris, 1867. In this document the claim is unguardedly\r\nmade that Harrisse’s book was the earliest piece of solid erudition\r\nwhich America had produced,—a phrase qualified later as applying to\r\nworks of American bibliography only. It was pointed out that while\r\nfor the period of 1492-1551 Rich had given twenty titles, and Ternaux\r\nfifty-eight, Harrisse had enumerated three hundred and eight.[39]\r\n\r\nHarrisse prepared, while shut up in Paris during the siege of 1870,\r\nhis _Notes sur la Nouvelle France_, a valuable bibliographical essay\r\nreferred to elsewhere.[40] He later put in shape the material which he\r\nhad gathered for a supplemental volume to his _Bibliotheca Americana\r\nVetustissima_, which he called _Additions_,[41] and published it in\r\nParis in 1872. In his introduction to this latter volume he shows how\r\nthoroughly he has searched the libraries of Europe for new evidences of\r\ninterest in America during the first half century after its discovery.\r\nHe notes the depredations upon the older libraries which have been\r\nmade in recent years, since the prices for rare Americana have ruled\r\nso high. He finds[42] that the Biblioteca Colombina at Seville, as\r\ncompared with a catalogue of it made by Ferdinand Columbus himself, has\r\nsuffered immense losses. “It is curious to notice,” he finally says,\r\n“how few of the original books relating to the early history of the New\r\nWorld can be found in the public libraries of Europe. There is not a\r\nliterary institution, however rich and ancient, which in this respect\r\ncould compare with three or four private libraries in America. The\r\nMarciana at Venice is probably the richest. The Trivulgiana at Milan\r\ncan boast of several great rarities.”\r\n\r\nFor the third contributor to the recent bibliography of Americana, we\r\nmust still turn to an adopted citizen, Joseph Sabin, an Englishman by\r\nbirth. Various publishing enterprises of interest to the historical\r\nstudent are associated with Mr. Sabin’s name. He published a quarto\r\nseries of reprints of early American tracts, eleven in number, and an\r\noctavo series, seven in number.[43] He published for several years,\r\nbeginning in 1869, the _American Bibliopolist_, a record of new books,\r\nwith literary miscellanies, largely upon Americana. In 1867 he began\r\nthe publication (five hundred copies) of the most extensive American\r\nbibliography yet made, _A Dictionary of books relating to America, from\r\nits discovery to the present time_. The author’s death, in 1881,[44]\r\nleft the work somewhat more than half done, and it has been continued\r\nsince his death by his sons.[45]\r\n\r\nIn the _Notas Para una bibliografia de obras anonimas i seudonimas_\r\nof Diego Barros Arana, published at Santiago de Chile in 1882, five\r\nhundred and seven books on America (1493-1876), without authors, are\r\ntraced to their writers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs a second class of contributors to the bibliographical records of\r\nAmerica, we must reckon the students who have gathered libraries for\r\nuse in pursuing their historical studies. Foremost among such, and\r\nentitled to be esteemed a pioneer in the modern spirit of research, is\r\nAlexander von Humboldt. He published his _Examen critique de l’histoire\r\nde la géographie du nouveau continent_,[46] in five volumes, between\r\n1836 and 1839.[47] “It is,” says Brevoort,[48] “a guide which all\r\nmust consult. With a master hand the author combines and collates all\r\nattainable materials, and draws light from sources which _he_ first\r\nbrings to bear in his exhaustive investigations.” Harrisse calls it\r\n“the greatest monument ever erected to the early history of this\r\ncontinent.”\r\n\r\nHumboldt’s library was bought by Henry Stevens, who printed in 1863,\r\nin London, a catalogue of it, showing 11,164 entries; but this was not\r\npublished till 1870. It included a set of the _Examen critique_, with\r\ncorrections, and the notes for a new sixth volume.[49] Harrisse, who\r\nit is believed contemplated at one time a new edition of this book,\r\nalleges that through the remissness of the purchaser of the library\r\nthe world has lost sight of these precious memorials of Humboldt’s\r\nunperfected labors. Stevens, in the _London Athenæum_, October, 1866,\r\nrebuts the charge.[50]\r\n\r\nOf the collection of books and manuscripts formed by Col. Peter Force\r\nwe have no separate record, apart from their making a portion of the\r\ngeneral catalogue of the Library of Congress, the Government having\r\nbought the collection in 1867.[51]\r\n\r\nThe library which Jared Sparks formed during the progress of his\r\nhistorical labors was sold about 1872 to Cornell University, and is now\r\nat Ithaca. Mr. Sparks left behind him “imperfect but not unfaithful\r\nlists of his books,” which, after some supervision by Dr. Cogswell and\r\nothers, were put in shape for the press by Mr. Charles A. Cutter of\r\nthe Boston Athenæum, and were printed, in 1871, as _Catalogue of the\r\nLibrary of Jared Sparks_. In the appendix was a list of the historical\r\nmanuscripts, originals and copies, which are now on deposit in Harvard\r\nCollege Library.[52]\r\n\r\nIn 1849 Mr. H. R. Schoolcraft[53] printed, at the expense of the United\r\nStates Government, a _Bibliographical Catalogue of books, etc., in\r\nthe Indian tongues of the United States_,—a list later reprinted with\r\nadditions in his _Indian Tribes_ (in 1851), vol. iv.[54]\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Mr. Ephraim George Squier published at New York a monograph\r\non authors who had written in the languages of Central America,\r\nenumerating one hundred and ten, with a list of the books and\r\nmanuscripts on the history, the aborigines, and the antiquities of\r\nCentral America, borrowed from other sources in part. At the sale of\r\nMr. Squier’s library in 1876, the catalogue[55] of which was made by\r\nMr. Sabin, the entire collection of his manuscripts fell, as mentioned\r\nelsewhere,[56] into the hands of Mr. Hubert Howe Bancroft of San\r\nFrancisco.\r\n\r\nProbably the largest collection of books and manuscripts[57] which\r\nany American has formed for use in writing is that which belongs to\r\nMr. Bancroft. He is the organizer of an extensive series of books on\r\nthe antiquities and history of the Pacific coast. To accomplish an\r\nexamination of the aboriginal and civilized history of so large a\r\nfield[58] as thoroughly as he has unquestionably made it, within a\r\nlifetime, was a bold undertaking, to be carried out in a centre of\r\nmaterial rather than of literary enterprise. The task involved the\r\ngathering of a library of printed books, at a distance from the purely\r\nintellectual activity of the country, and where no other collection of\r\nmoment existed to supplement it. It required the seeking and making\r\nof manuscripts, from the labor of which one might well shrink. It was\r\nfortunate that during the gathering of this collection some notable\r\ncollections—like those of Maximilian,[59] Ramirez, and Squier, not to\r\nname others—were opportunely brought to the hammer, a chance by which\r\nMr. Bancroft naturally profited.\r\n\r\nMr. Bancroft had been trained in the business habits of the book\r\ntrade, in which he had established himself in San Francisco as early\r\nas 1856.[60] He was at this time twenty-four years old, having been\r\nborn of New England stock in Ohio in 1832, and having had already four\r\nyears residence—since 1852—in San Francisco as the agent of an eastern\r\nbookseller. It was not till 1869 that he set seriously to work on his\r\nhistory, and organized a staff of assistants.[61] They indexed his\r\nlibrary, which was now large (12,000 volumes) and was kept on an upper\r\nfloor of his business quarters, and they classified the references\r\nin paper bags.[62] His first idea was to make an encyclopædia of\r\nthe antiquities and history of the Pacific Coast; and it is on the\r\nwhole unfortunate that he abandoned the scheme, for his methods were\r\nadmirably adapted to that end, but of questionable application to a\r\nsustained plan of historical treatment. It is the encyclopedic quality\r\nof his work, as the user eliminates what he wishes, which makes and\r\nwill continue to make the books that pass under his name of the first\r\nimportance to historical students.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 the first five volumes of the series, denominated by\r\nthemselves _The Native Races of the Pacific States_, made their\r\nappearance. It was clear that a new force had been brought to bear upon\r\nhistorical research,—the force of organized labor from many hands;\r\nand this implied competent administrative direction and ungrudged\r\nexpenditure of money. The work showed the faults of such a method, in\r\na want of uniform discrimination, and in that promiscuous avidity of\r\nsearch, which marks rather an eagerness to amass than a judgment to\r\nselect, and give literary perspective. The book, however, was accepted\r\nas extremely useful and promising to the future inquirer. Despite\r\na certain callowness of manner, the _Native Races_ was extremely\r\ncreditable, with comparatively little of the patronizing and flippant\r\nair which its flattering reception has since begotten in its author or\r\nhis staff. An unfamiliarity with the amenities of literary life seems\r\nunexpectedly to have been more apparent also in his later work.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1876, Mr. Lewis H. Morgan printed in the _North American\r\nReview_, under the title of “Montezuma’s Dinner,” a paper in which he\r\ncontroverted the views expressed in the _Native Races_ regarding the\r\nkind of aboriginal civilization belonging to the Mexican and Central\r\nAmerican table-lands. A writer of Mr. Morgan’s reputation commanded\r\nrespect in all but Mr. Bancroft, who has been unwise enough to charge\r\nhim with seeking “to gain notoriety by attacking” his (Mr. B.’s) views\r\nor supposed views. He dares also to characterize so well-known an\r\nauthority as “a person going about from one reviewer to another begging\r\ncondemnation for my _Native Races_.” It was this ungracious tone which\r\nproduced a divided reception for his new venture. This, after an\r\ninterval of seven years, began to make its appearance in vol. vi. of\r\nthe “Works,” or vol. i. of the _History of Central America_, appearing\r\nin the autumn of 1882.\r\n\r\nThe changed tone of the new series, its rhetoric, ambitious in parts,\r\nbut mixed with passages which are often forceful and exact, suggestive\r\nof an ill-assorted conjoint production; the interlarding of classic\r\nallusions by some retained reviser who served this purpose for one\r\nvolume at least; a certain cheap reasoning and ranting philosophy,\r\nwhich gives place at times to conceptions of grasp; flippancy\r\nand egotism, which induce a patronizing air under the guise of a\r\nconstrained adulation of others; a want of knowledge on points where\r\nthe system of indexing employed by his staff had been deficient,—these\r\ntraits served to separate the criticism of students from the ordinary\r\nlaudation of such as were dazed by the magnitude of the scheme.\r\n\r\nTwo reviews challenging his merits on these grounds[63] induced\r\nMr. Bancroft to reply in a tract[64] called _The Early American\r\nChroniclers_. The manner of this rejoinder is more offensive than\r\nthat of the volumes which it defends; and with bitter language he\r\ncharges the reviewers with being “men of Morgan,” working in concert to\r\nprejudice his success.\r\n\r\nBut the controversy of which record is here made is unworthy of the\r\nprincipal party to it. His important work needs no such adventitious\r\nsupport; and the occasion for it might have been avoided by ordinary\r\nprudence. The extent of the library upon which the work[65] is based,\r\nand the full citation of the authorities followed in his notes, and the\r\nmore general enumeration of them in his preliminary lists, make the\r\nwork pre-eminent for its bibliographical extent, however insufficient,\r\nand at times careless, is the bibliographical record.[66]\r\n\r\nThe library formed by the late Henry C. Murphy of Brooklyn to assist\r\nhim in his projected history of maritime discovery in America, of which\r\nonly the chapter on Verrazano[67] has been printed, was the creation\r\nof diligent search for many years, part of which was spent in Holland\r\nas minister of the United States. The earliest record of it is a\r\n_Catalogue of an American library chronologically arranged_, which was\r\nprivately printed in a few copies, about 1850, and showed five hundred\r\nand eighty-nine entries between the years 1480 and 1800.[68]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES CARSON BREVOORT.]\r\n\r\nThere has been no catalogue printed of the library of Mr. James Carson\r\nBrevoort, so well known as a historical student and bibliographer, to\r\nwhom Mr. Sabin dedicated the first volume of his _Dictionary_. Some of\r\nthe choicer portions of his collection are understood to have become a\r\npart of the Astor Library, of which Mr. Brevoort was for a few years\r\nthe superintendent, as well as a trustee.[69]\r\n\r\nThe useful and choice collection of Mr. Charles Deane, of Cambridge,\r\nMass., to which, as the reader will discover, the Editor has often had\r\nrecourse, has never been catalogued. Mr. Deane has made excellent use\r\nof it, as his tracts and papers abundantly show.[70]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA distinct class of helpers in the field of American bibliography\r\nhas been those gatherers of libraries who are included under the\r\nsomewhat indefinite term of collectors,—owners of books, but who\r\nmake no considerable dependence upon them for studies which lead to\r\npublication. From such, however, in some instances, bibliography has\r\nnotably gained,—as in the careful knowledge which Mr. James Lenox\r\nsometimes dispensed to scholars either in privately printed issues or\r\nin the pages of periodicals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLES DEANE.]\r\n\r\nHarrisse in 1866 pointed to five Americana libraries in the United\r\nStates as surpassing all of their kind in Europe,—the Carter-Brown,\r\nBarlow, Force, Murphy, and Lenox collections. Of the Barlow, Force (now\r\nin the Library of Congress), and Murphy collections mention has already\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nThe Lenox Library is no longer private, having been given to a board\r\nof trustees by Mr. Lenox previous to his death,[71] and handsomely\r\nhoused, by whom it is held for a restricted public use, when fully\r\ncatalogued and arranged. Its character, as containing only rare or\r\nunusual books, will necessarily withdraw it from the use of all but\r\nscholars engaged in recondite studies. It is very rich in other\r\ndirections than American history; but in this department the partial\r\naccess which Harrisse had to it while in Mr. Lenox’s house led him to\r\ninfer that it would hold the first rank. The wealth of its alcoves,\r\nwith their twenty-eight thousand volumes, is becoming known gradually\r\nin a series of bibliographical monographs, printed as contributions\r\nto its catalogue, of which six have thus far appeared, some of them\r\nclearly and mainly the work of Mr. Lenox himself.\r\n\r\nOf these only three have illustrated American history in any\r\ndegree,—those devoted to the voyages of Hulsius and Thévenot, and to\r\nthe Jesuit Relations (Canada).[72]\r\n\r\nThe only rival of the Lenox is the library of the late John Carter\r\nBrown, of Providence, gathered largely under the supervision of\r\nJohn Russell Bartlett; and since Mr. Brown’s death it has been more\r\nparticularly under the same oversight.[73] It differs from the Lenox\r\nLibrary in that it is exclusively American, or nearly so,[74] and\r\nstill more in that we have access to a thorough catalogue of its\r\nresources, made by Mr. Bartlett himself, and sumptuously printed.[75]\r\nIt was originally issued as _Bibliotheca Americana: A Catalogue of\r\nbooks relating to North and South America in the Library of John\r\nCarter Brown of Providence, with notes by John Russell Bartlett_, in\r\nthree volumes,—vol. i., 1493-1600, in 1865 (302 entries); vol. ii.,\r\n1601-1700, in 1866 (1,160 entries); vol. iii., 1701-1800, in two parts,\r\nin 1870-1871 (4,173 entries).\r\n\r\nIn 1875 vol. i. was reprinted with fuller titles, covering the\r\nyears 1482[76]-1601, with 600 entries, doubling the extent of that\r\nportion.[77] Numerous facsimiles of titles and maps add much to its\r\nvalue. A second and similarly extended edition of vol. ii. (1600-1700)\r\nwas printed in 1882, showing 1,642 entries. The _Carter-Brown\r\nCatalogue_, as it is ordinarily cited, is the most extensive printed\r\nlist of all Americana previous to 1800, more especially anterior to\r\n1700, which now exists.[78]\r\n\r\nOf the other important American catalogues, the first place is to be\r\nassigned to that of the collection formed at Hartford by Mr. George\r\nBrinley, the sale of which since his death[79] has been undertaken\r\nunder the direction of Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull,[80] who has prepared\r\nthe catalogue, and who claims—not without warrant—that it embraces\r\n“a greater number of volumes remarkable for their rarity, value, and\r\ninterest to special collectors and to book-lovers in general, than were\r\never before brought together in an American sale-room.”[81]\r\n\r\nThe library of William Menzies, of New York, was sold in 1875,\r\nfrom a catalogue made by Joseph Sabin.[82] The library of Edward\r\nA. Crowninshield, of Boston, was catalogued in Boston in 1859, but\r\nwithdrawn from public sale, and sold to Henry Stevens, who took a\r\nportion of it to London. It was not large,—the catalogue shows less\r\nthan 1,200 titles,—and was not exclusively American; but it was rich in\r\nsome of the rarest of such books, particularly in regard to the English\r\nColonies.[83]\r\n\r\nThe sale of John Allan’s collection in New York, in 1864, was a\r\nnoteworthy one. Americana, however, were but a portion of the\r\ncollection.[84] An English-American flavor of far less fineness, but\r\nrepresented in a catalogue showing a very large collection of books and\r\npamphlets,[85] was sold in New York in May, 1870, as the property of\r\nMr. E. P. Boon.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas W. Field issued in 1873 _An Essay towards an Indian\r\nBibliography, being a Catalogue of books relating to the American\r\nIndians_, in his own library, with a few others which he did\r\nnot possess, distinguished by an asterisk. Mr. Field added many\r\nbibliographical and historical notes, and gave synopses, so that\r\nthe catalogue is generally useful to the student of Americana, as\r\nhe did not confine his survey to works dealing exclusively with the\r\naborigines. The library upon which this bibliography was based was\r\nsold at public auction in New York, in two parts, in May, 1875 (3,324\r\ntitles), according to a catalogue which is a distinct publication from\r\nthe _Essay_.[86]\r\n\r\nThe collection of Mr. Almon W. Griswold was dispersed by printed\r\ncatalogues in 1876 and 1880, the former containing the American\r\nportion, rich in many of the rarer books.\r\n\r\nOf the various private collections elsewhere than in the United\r\nStates, more or less rich in Americana, mention may be made of the\r\n_Bibliotheca Mejicana_[87] of Augustin Fischer, London, 1869; of the\r\nSpanish-American libraries of Gregorio Beéche, whose catalogue was\r\nprinted at Valparaiso in 1879; and that of Benjamin Vicuña Mackenna,\r\nprinted at the same place in 1861.[88]\r\n\r\nIn Leipsic, the catalogue of Serge Sobolewski (1873)[89] was\r\nparticularly helpful in the bibliography of Ptolemy, and in the voyages\r\nof De Bry and others. Some of the rarest of Americana were sold in\r\nthe Sunderland sale[90] in London in 1881-1883; and remarkably rich\r\ncollections were those of Pinart and Bourbourg,[91] sold in Paris in\r\n1883, and that of Dr. J. Court,[92] the first part of which was sold in\r\nParis in May, 1884. The second part had little of interest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStill another distinctive kind of bibliographies is found in the\r\ncatalogues of the better class of dealers; and among the best of such\r\nis to be placed the various lists printed by Henry Stevens, a native of\r\nVermont, who has spent most of his manhood in London. In the dedication\r\nto John Carter Brown of his _Schedule of Nuggets_ (1870), he gives\r\nsome account of his early bibliographical quests.[93] Two years after\r\ngraduating at Yale, he says, he had passed “at Cambridge, reading\r\npassively with legal Story, and actively with historical Sparks, all\r\nthe while sifting and digesting the treasures of the Harvard Library.\r\nFor five years previously he had scouted through several States during\r\nhis vacations, prospecting in out-of-the-way places for historical\r\nnuggets, mousing through town libraries and country garrets in search\r\nof anything old that was historically new for Peter Force and his\r\nAmerican Archives.... From Vermont to Delaware many an antiquated\r\nchurn, sequestered hen-coop, and dilapidated flour-barrel had yielded\r\nto him rich harvests of old papers, musty books, and golden pamphlets.\r\nFinally, in 1845, an irrefragable desire impelled him to visit the\r\nOld World, its libraries and book-stalls. Mr. Brown’s enlightened\r\nliberality in those primitive years of his bibliographical pupilage\r\ncontributed largely towards the boiling of his kettle.... In acquiring\r\n_con amore_ these American Historiadores Primitivos, he ... travelled\r\nfar and near. In this labor of love, this journey of life, his tracks\r\noften become your tracks, his labors your works, his _libri_ your\r\n_liberi_,” he adds, in addressing Mr. Brown.\r\n\r\nIn 1848 Mr. Stevens proposed the publication, through the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, of a general _Bibliographia Americana_, illustrating the\r\nsources of early American history;[94] but the project failed, and\r\none or more attempts later made to begin the work also stopped short\r\nof a beginning. While working as a literary agent of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution and other libraries, in these years, and beginning that\r\nsystematic selection of American books, for the British Museum and\r\nBodleian, which has made these libraries so nearly, if not quite, the\r\nequal of any collection of Americana in the United States, he also\r\nmade the transcriptions and indexes of the documents in the State\r\nPaper Office which respectively concern the States of New Jersey,\r\nRhode Island, Maryland, and Virginia. These labors are now preserved\r\nin the archives of those States.[95] Perhaps the earliest of his sale\r\ncatalogues was that of a pseudo “Count Mondidier,” embracing Americana,\r\nwhich were sold in London in December, 1851.[96] His _English Library_\r\nin 1853 was without any distinctive American flavor; but in 1854 he\r\nbegan, but suspended after two numbers, the _American Bibliographer_\r\n(100 copies).[97] In 1856 he prepared a _Catalogue of American Books\r\nand Maps in the British Museum_ (20,000 titles), which, however,\r\nwas never regularly published, but copies bear date 1859, 1862, and\r\n1866.[98] In 1858—though most copies are dated 1862[99]—appeared his\r\n_Historical Nuggets; Bibliotheca Americana, or a descriptive Account\r\nof my Collection of rare books relating to America_. The two little\r\nvolumes show about three thousand titles, and Harrisse says they\r\nare printed “with remarkable accuracy.” There was begun in 1885, in\r\nconnection with his son Mr. Henry Newton Stevens, a continuation\r\nof these _Nuggets_. In 1861 a sale catalogue of his _Bibliotheca\r\nAmericana_ (2,415 lots), issued by Puttick and Simpson, and in part\r\nan abridgment of the _Nuggets_ with similarly careful collations, was\r\naccepted by Maisonneuve as the model of his _Bibliothèque Américaine_\r\nlater to be mentioned.[100]\r\n\r\nIn 1869-1870 Mr. Stevens visited America, and printed at New Haven\r\nhis _Historical and Geographical Notes on the earliest discoveries in\r\nAmerica_, 1453-1530, with photo-lithographic facsimiles of some of\r\nthe earliest maps. It is a valuable essay, much referred to, in which\r\nthe author endeavored to indicate the entanglement of the Asiatic and\r\nAmerican coast lines in the early cartography.[101]\r\n\r\nIn 1870 he sold at Boston a collection of five thousand volumes,\r\ncatalogued as _Bibliotheca Historica_[102] (2,545 entries), being\r\nmostly Americana, from the library of the elder Henry Stevens of\r\nVermont. It has a characteristic introduction, with an array of\r\nreadable notes.[103] His catalogues have often such annotations,\r\ninserted on a principle which he explains in the introduction to\r\nthis one: “In the course of many years of bibliographical study and\r\nresearch, having picked up various isolated grains of knowledge\r\nrespecting the early history, geography, and bibliography of this\r\nwestern hemisphere, the writer has thought it well to pigeon-hole the\r\nfacts in notes long and short.”\r\n\r\nIn October, 1870, he printed at London a _Schedule of Two Thousand\r\nAmerican Historical Nuggets taken from the Stevens Diggings in\r\nSeptember, 1870, and set down in Chronological Order of Printing from\r\n1490 to 1800 [1776], described and recommended as a Supplement to my\r\nprinted Bibliotheca Americana_. It included 1,350 titles.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 he sold another collection, largely Americana, according\r\nto a catalogue entitled _Bibliotheca Geographica & Historica; or,\r\na Catalogue of [3,109 lots], illustrative of historical geography\r\nand geographical history. Collected, used, and described, with an\r\nIntroductory Essay on Catalogues, and how to make them upon the Stevens\r\nsystem of photo-bibliography_. The title calls it a first part; but\r\nno second part ever appeared. Ten copies were issued, with about four\r\nhundred photographic copies of titles inserted. Some copies are found\r\nwithout the essay.[104]\r\n\r\nThe next year (1873) he issued a privately printed list of two thousand\r\ntitles of American “Continuations,” as they are called by librarians,\r\nor serial publications in progress as taken at the British Museum,\r\nquaintly terming the list _American books with tails to ’em_.[105]\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1881, he printed Part I. of _Stevens’s Historical\r\nCollections_, a sale catalogue showing 1,625 titles of books, chiefly\r\nAmericana, and including his Franklin Collection of manuscripts, which\r\nhe later privately sold to the United States Government, an agent of\r\nthe Boston Public Library yielding to the nation.[106]\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest to establish an antiquarian bookshop in the United\r\nStates was the late Samuel G. Drake, who opened one in Boston in\r\n1830.[107] His special field was that of the North American Indians;\r\nand the history and antiquities of the aborigines, together with the\r\nhistory of the English Colonies, give a character to his numerous\r\ncatalogues.[108] Mr. Drake died in 1875, from a cold taken at a sale of\r\nthe library of Daniel Webster; and his final collections of books were\r\nscattered in two sales in the following year.[109]\r\n\r\nWilliam Gowans, of New York, was another of the early dealers in\r\nAmericana.[110] The catalogues of Bartlett and Welford have already\r\nbeen mentioned. In 1854, while Garrigue and Christern were acting\r\nas agents of Mr. Lenox, they printed _Livres Curieux_, a list of\r\ndesiderata sought for by Mr. Lenox, pertaining to such rarities as the\r\nletters of Columbus, Cartier, parts of De Bry and Hulsius, and the\r\nJesuit Relations. This list was circulated widely through Europe, but\r\nnot twenty out of the 216 titles were ever offered.[111]\r\n\r\nAbout 1856, Charles B. Norton, of New York, began to issue American\r\ncatalogues; and in 1857 he established _Norton’s Literary Letter_,\r\nintended to foster interest in the collection of Americana.[112] A\r\nlittle later, Joel Munsell, of Albany, began to issue catalogues;[113]\r\nand J. W. Randolph, of Richmond, Virginia, more particularly\r\nillustrated the history of the southern parts of the United\r\nStates.[114] The most important Americana lists at present issued by\r\nAmerican dealers are those of Robert Clarke & Co., of Cincinnati, which\r\nare admirable specimens of such lists.[115]\r\n\r\nIn England, the catalogues of Henry Stevens and E. G. Allen have\r\nbeen already mentioned. The leading English dealer at present in the\r\nchoicer books of Americana, as of all other subjects—and it is not too\r\nmuch to say, the leading one of the world—is Mr. Bernard Quaritch,\r\na Prussian by birth, who was born in 1819, and after some service\r\nin the book-trade in his native country came to London in 1842, and\r\nentered the service of Henry G. Bohn, under whose instruction, and as\r\na fellow-employé of Lowndes the bibliographer, he laid the foundations\r\nof a remarkable bibliographical acquaintance. A short service in\r\nParis brought him the friendship of Brunet. Again (1845) he returned\r\nto Mr. Bohn’s shop; but in April, 1847, he began business in London\r\nfor himself. He issued his catalogues at once on a small scale; but\r\nthey took their well-known distinctive form in 1848, which they have\r\nretained, except during the interval December, 1854,-May, 1864, when,\r\nto secure favorable consideration in the post-office rates, the\r\nserial was called _The Museum_. It has been his habit, at intervals,\r\nto collect his occasional catalogues into volumes, and provide them\r\nwith an index. The first of these (7,000 entries) was issued in 1860.\r\nOthers have been issued in 1864, 1868, 1870, 1874, 1877 (this with\r\nthe preceding constituting one work, showing nearly 45,000 entries\r\nor 200,000 volumes), and 1880 (describing 28,009 books).[116] In the\r\npreface to this last catalogue he says: “The prices of useful and\r\nlearned books are in all cases moderate; the prices of palæographical\r\nand bibliographical curiosities are no doubt in most cases high, that\r\nindeed being a natural result of the great rivalry between English,\r\nFrench, and American collectors.... A fine copy of any edition of a\r\nbook is, and ought to be, more than twice as costly as any other.”[117]\r\nWhile the Quaritch catalogues have been general, they have included a\r\nlarge share of the rarest Americana, whose titles have been illustrated\r\nwith bibliographical notes characterized by intimate acquaintance with\r\nthe secrets of the more curious lore.\r\n\r\nThe catalogues of John Russell Smith (1849, 1853, 1865, 1867), and of\r\nhis successor Alfred Russell Smith (1871, 1874), are useful aids in\r\nthis department.[118] The _Bibliotheca Hispano-Americana_ of Trübner,\r\nprinted in 1870, offered about thirteen hundred items.[119] Occasional\r\nreference can be usefully made to the lists of George Bumstead, Ellis\r\nand White, John Camden Hotten, all of London, and to those of William\r\nGeorge of Bristol. The latest extensive Americana catalogue is _A\r\ncatalogue of rare and curious books, all of which relate more or less\r\nto America_, on sale by F. S. Ellis, London, 1884. It shows three\r\nhundred and forty-two titles, including many of the rarer books, which\r\nare held at prices startling even to one accustomed to the rapid rise\r\nin the cost of books of this description. Many of them were sold by\r\nauction in 1885.\r\n\r\nIn France, since Ternaux, the most important contribution has come from\r\nthe house of Maisonneuve et Cie., by whom the _Bibliotheca Americana_\r\nof Charles Leclerc has been successively issued to represent their\r\nextraordinary stock. The first edition was printed in 1867 (1,647\r\nentries), the second in 1878[120] (2,638 entries, with an admirable\r\nindex), besides a first supplement in 1881 (nos. 2,639-3,029).\r\nMr. Quaritch characterizes it as edited “with admirable skill and\r\nknowledge.”\r\n\r\nLess important but useful lists, issued in France, have been those of\r\nHector Bossange, Edwin Tross,[121] and the current _Americana_ series\r\nof Dufossé, which was begun in 1876.[122]\r\n\r\nIn Holland, most admirable work has been done by Frederik Muller, of\r\nAmsterdam, and by Mr. Asher, Mr. Tiele, and Mr. Otto Harrassowitz under\r\nhis patronage, of which ample accounts are given in another place.[123]\r\nMuller’s catalogues were begun in 1850, but did not reach distinctive\r\nmerit till 1872.[124] Martin Nijhoff, at the Hague, has also issued\r\nsome American catalogues.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 Muller sold one of his collections of Americana to Brockhaus,\r\nof Leipsic, and the _Bibliothèque Américaine_ issued by that publisher\r\nin 1861, as representing this collection, was compiled by one of the\r\neditors of the _Serapeum_, Paul Trömel, whom Harrisse characterizes as\r\nan “expert bibliographer and trustworthy scholar.” The list shows 435\r\nentries by a chronological arrangement (1507-1700). Brockhaus again, in\r\n1866, issued another American list, showing books since 1508, arranged\r\ntopically (nos. 7,261-8,611). Mr. Otto Harrassowitz, of Leipsic, a\r\npupil of Muller, of Amsterdam, has also entered the field as a purveyor\r\nof choice Americana. T. O. Weigel, of Leipsic, issued a catalogue,\r\nlargely American, in 1877.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo well known are the general bibliographies of Watt, Lowndes, Brunet,\r\nGraesse, and others, that it is not necessary to point out their\r\ndistinctive merits.[125] Students in this field are familiar with the\r\ncatalogues of the chief American libraries. The library of Harvard\r\nCollege has not issued a catalogue since 1834, though it now prints\r\nbulletins of its current accessions. An admirable catalogue of the\r\nBoston Athenæum brings the record of that collection down to 1871.\r\nThe numerous catalogues of the Boston Public Library are of much use,\r\nespecially the distinct volume given to the Prince Collection. The\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society’s library has a catalogue printed\r\nin 1859-60. There has been no catalogue of the American Antiquarian\r\nSociety since 1837, and the New England Historic Genealogical Society\r\nhas never printed any; nor has the Congregational Library. The State\r\nLibrary at Boston issued a catalogue in 1880. These libraries, with\r\nthe Carter-Brown Library at Providence, which is courteously opened to\r\nstudents properly introduced, probably make Boston within easy distance\r\nof a larger proportion of the books illustrating American history, than\r\ncan be reached with equal convenience from any other literary centre.\r\nA book on the private libraries of Boston was compiled by Luther\r\nFarnham in 1855; but many of the private collections then existing have\r\nsince been scattered.[126] General Horatio Rogers has made a similar\r\nrecord of those in Providence. After the Carter-Brown Collection, the\r\nmost valuable of these private libraries in New England is probably\r\nthat of Mr. Charles Deane in Cambridge, of which mention has already\r\nbeen made. The collection of the Rev. Henry M. Dexter, D.D., of New\r\nBedford, is probably unexampled in this country for the history of the\r\nCongregational movement, which so largely affected the early history of\r\nthe English Colonies.[127]\r\n\r\nTwo other centres in the United States are of the first importance in\r\nthis respect. In Washington, with the Library of Congress (of which\r\na general consolidated catalogue is now printing), embracing as it\r\ndoes the collection formed by Col. Peter Force, and supplementing\r\nthe archives of the Government, an investigator of American history\r\nis situated extremely favorably.[128] In New York the Astor and\r\nLenox libraries, with those of the New York Historical Society and\r\nAmerican Geographical Society, give the student great opportunities.\r\nThe catalogue of the Astor Library was printed in 1857-66, and that\r\nof the Historical Society in 1859. No general catalogue of the Lenox\r\nLibrary has yet been printed. An account of the private libraries of\r\nNew York was published by Dr. Wynne in 1860. The libraries of the\r\nchief importance at the present time, in respect to American history,\r\nare those of Mr. S. L. M. Barlow in New York, and of Mr. James Carson\r\nBrevoort in Brooklyn. Mr. Charles H. Kalbfleisch of New York has a\r\nsmall collection, but it embraces some of the rarest books. The New\r\nYork State Library at Albany is the chief of the libraries of its\r\nclass, and its principal characteristic pertains to American history.\r\n\r\nThe other chief American cities are of much less importance as centres\r\nfor historical research. The Philadelphia Library and the collection of\r\nthe Historical Society of Pennsylvania are hardly of distinctive value,\r\nexcept in regard to the history of that State. In Baltimore the library\r\nof the Peabody Institute, of which the first volume of an excellent\r\ncatalogue has been printed, and that of the Maryland Historical Society\r\nare scarcely sufficient for exhaustive research. The private library\r\nof Mr. H. H. Bancroft constitutes the only important resource of the\r\nPacific States;[129] and the most important collection in Canada is\r\nthat represented by the catalogue of the Library of Parliament, which\r\nwas printed in 1858.\r\n\r\nThis enumeration is intended only to indicate the chief places for\r\nease of general investigation in American history. Other localities are\r\nrich in local helps, and accounts of such will be found elsewhere in\r\nthe present History.[130]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n_By the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. THE EARLY DESCRIPTIONS OF AMERICA AND COLLECTIVE ACCOUNTS OF\r\nTHE EARLY VOYAGES THERETO.\r\n\r\nOF the earliest collection of voyages of which we have any mention we\r\npossess only a defective copy, which is in the Biblioteca Marciana,\r\nand is called _Libretto de tutta la navigazione del Rè di Spagna delle\r\nisole e terreni nuovamente scoperti stampato per Vercellese_. It was\r\npublished at Venice in 1504,[131] and is said to contain the first\r\nthree voyages of Columbus. This account, together with the narrative of\r\nCabral’s voyage printed at Rome and Milan, and an original—at present\r\nunknown—of Vespucius’ third voyage, were embodied, with other matter,\r\nin the _Paesi novamente retrovati et novo mondo da Alberico Vesputio\r\nFlorentino intitulato_, published at Vicentia in 1507,[132] and again\r\npossibly at Vicentia in 1508,—though the evidence is wanting to support\r\nthe statement,—but certainly at Milan in that year (1508).[133] There\r\nwere later editions in 1512,[134] 1517,[135] 1519[136] (published at\r\nMilan), and 1521.[137] There are also German,[138] Low German,[139]\r\nLatin,[140] and French[141] translations.\r\n\r\nWhile this Zorzi-Montalboddo compilation was flourishing, an Italian\r\nscholar, domiciled in Spain, was recording, largely at first hand, the\r\nvaried reports of the voyages which were then opening a new existence\r\nto the world. This was Peter Martyr, of whom Harrisse[142] cites an\r\nearly and quaint sketch from Hernando Alonso de Herrera’s _Disputatio\r\nadversus Aristotelez_ (1517).[143] The general historians have always\r\nmade due acknowledgment of his service to them.[144]\r\n\r\nHarrisse could find no evidence of Martyr’s First Decade having\r\nbeen printed at Seville as early as 1500, as is sometimes stated;\r\nbut it has been held that a translation of it,—though no copy is now\r\nknown,—made by Angelo Trigviano into Italian was the _Libretto de tutta\r\nla navigazione del Rè di Spagna_, already mentioned.[145] The earliest\r\nunquestioned edition was that of 1511, which was printed at Seville\r\nwith the title _Legatio Babylonica_; it contained nine books and a part\r\nof the tenth book of the First Decade.[146] In 1516 a new edition,\r\nwithout map, was printed at Alcalá in Roman letter. The part of the\r\ntenth book of the First Decade in the 1511 edition is here annexed to\r\nthe ninth, and a new tenth book is added, besides two other decades,\r\nmaking three in all.[147]\r\n\r\nThere exists what has been called a German version (_Die Schiffung\r\nmitt dem lanndt der Gulden Insel_) of the First Decade, in which the\r\nsupposed author is called Johan von Angliara; and its date is 1520,\r\nor thereabout; but Mr. Deane, who has the book, says that it is not\r\nMartyr’s.[148] Some _Poemata_, which had originally been included\r\nin the publication of the First Decade, were separately printed in\r\n1520.[149]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TITLE OF THE NEWE UNBEKANTHE LANDTE (REDUCED).]\r\n\r\nAt Basle in 1521 appeared his _De nuper sub D. Carolo repertis\r\ninsulis_, the title of which is annexed in fac-simile. Harrisse[150]\r\nhas called it an extract from the Fourth Decade; and a similar\r\nstatement is made in the _Carter-Brown Catalogue_ (vol. i. no. 67). But\r\nStevens and other authorities define it as a substitute for the lost\r\nFirst Letter of Cortes, touching the expedition of Grijalva and the\r\ninvasion of Mexico; and it supplements, rather than overlaps, Martyr’s\r\nother narratives.[151] Mr. Deane contends that if the Fourth Decade had\r\nthen been written, this might well be considered an abridgment of it.\r\n\r\nThe first complete edition (_De orbe novo_) of all the eight decades\r\nwas published in 1530 at Complutum; and with it is usually found the\r\nmap (“Tipus orbis universalis”) of Apianus, which originally appeared\r\nin Camer’s _Solinus_ in 1520. In this new issue the map has its date\r\nchanged to 1530.[152]\r\n\r\nIn 1532, at Paris, appeared an abridgment in French of the first three\r\ndecades, together with an abstract of Martyr’s _De insulis_ (Basle,\r\n1521), followed by abridgments of the printed second and third letters\r\nof Cortes,—the whole bearing the title, _Extraict ov Recveil des Isles\r\nnouuellemēt trouuees en la grand mer Oceane en temps du roy Despaigne\r\nFernād & Elizabeth sa femme, faict premierement en latin par Pierre\r\nMartyr de Millan, & depuis translate en languaige francoys_.[153]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DE NVPER\r\n\r\nSVB D.

XXI.]\r\n\r\nIn 1533, at Basle, in folio, we find the first three decades and the\r\ntract of 1521 (_De insulis_) united in _De rebus oceanicis et orbe\r\nnovo_.[154]\r\n\r\nAt Venice, in 1534, the _Summario de la generale historia de l’Indie\r\noccidentali_ was a joint issue of Martyr and Oviedo, under the editing\r\nof Ramusio.[155] An edition of Martyr, published at Paris in 1536,\r\nsometimes mentioned,[156] does not apparently exist;[157] but an\r\nedition of 1537 is noted by Sabin.[158] In 1555 Richard Eden’s _Decades\r\nof the Newe Worlde, or West India_, appeared in black-letter at London.\r\nIt is made up in large part from Martyr,[159] and was the basis of\r\nRichard Willes’ edition of Eden in 1577, which included the first four\r\ndecades, and an abridgment of the last four, with additions from Oviedo\r\nand others,—all under the new name, _The History of Trauayle_.[160]\r\n\r\nThere was an edition again at Cologne in 1574,—the one which Robertson\r\nused.[161] Three decades and the _De insulis_ are also included in a\r\ncomposite folio published at Basle in 1582, containing also Benzoni\r\nand Levinus, all in German.[162] The entire eight decades, in Latin,\r\nwhich had not been printed together since the Basle edition of 1530,\r\nwere published in Paris in 1587 under the editing of Richard Hakluyt,\r\nwith the title: _De orbe novo Petri Martyris Anglerii Mediolanensis,\r\nprotonotarij, et Caroli quinti senatoris Decades octo, diligenti\r\ntemporum obseruatione, et vtilissimis annotationibus illustratæ, suôque\r\nnitori restitutæ, labore et industria Richardi Haklvyti Oxoniensis\r\nAngli.

G.” map, it is\r\nexceedingly rare.[163]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRYNÆUS.\r\n\r\nFac-simile of cut in Reusner’s _Icones_ (Strasburg, 1590), p. 107.]\r\n\r\nAs illustrating in some sort his more labored work, the _Opus\r\nepistolarum Petri Martyris_ was first printed at Complutum in\r\n1530.[164] The letters were again published at Amsterdam, in 1670,[165]\r\nin an edition which had the care of Ch. Patin, to which was appended\r\nother letters by Fernando del Pulgar.[166]\r\n\r\nThe most extensive of the early collections was the _Novus orbis_,\r\nwhich was issued in separate editions at Basle and Paris in 1532.\r\nSimon Grynæus, a learned professor at Basle, signed the preface; and\r\nit usually passes under his name. Grynæus was born in Swabia, was\r\na friend of Luther, visited England in 1531, and died in Basle, in\r\n1541. The compilation, however, is the work of a canon of Strasburg,\r\nJohn Huttich (born about 1480; died, 1544), but the labor of revision\r\nfell on Grynæus.[167] It has the first three voyages of Columbus, and\r\nthose of Pinzon and Vespucius; the rest of the book is taken up with\r\nthe travels of Marco Polo and his successors to the East.[168] It\r\nnext appeared in a German translation at Strasburg in 1534, which was\r\nmade by Michal Herr, _Die New Welt_. It has no map, gives more from\r\nMartyr than the other edition, and substitutes a preface by Herr for\r\nthat of Grynæus.[169] The original Latin was reproduced at Basle again\r\nin 1537, with 1536 in the colophon.[170] In 1555 another edition was\r\nprinted at Basle, enlarged upon the 1537 edition by the insertion of\r\nthe second and third of the Cortes letters and some accounts of efforts\r\nin converting the Indians.[171] Those portions relating to America\r\nexclusively were reprinted in the Latin at Rotterdam in 1616.[172]\r\n\r\nSebastian Münster, who was born in 1489, was forty-three years old\r\nwhen his map of the world—which is preserved in the Paris (1532)\r\nedition of the _Novus orbis_—appeared. This is the first time that\r\nMünster significantly comes before us as a describer of the geography\r\nof the New World. Again in 1540 and 1542 he was associated with the\r\neditions of Ptolemy issued at Basle in those years.[173] It is,\r\nhowever, upon his _Cosmographia_, among his forty books, that Münster’s\r\nfame chiefly rests. The earliest editions are extremely rare, and seem\r\nnot to be clearly defined by the bibliographers. It appears to have\r\nbeen originally issued in German, probably in 1544 at Basle,[174]\r\nunder the mixed title: _Cosmographia. Beschreibūg aller lender Durch\r\nSebastianum Munsterum. Getruckt zü Basel durch Henrichum Petri, Anno\r\nMDxliiij._[175] He says that he had been engaged upon it for eighteen\r\nyears, keeping Strabo before him as a model. To the section devoted to\r\nAsia he adds a few pages “Von den neüwen inseln” (folios dcxxxv-dcxlij).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MÜNSTER.\r\n\r\nFac-simile of the cut in the _Ptolemy_ of 1552.]\r\n\r\nThis account was scant; and though it was a little enlarged in the\r\nsecond edition in 1545,[176] it remained of small extent through\r\nsubsequent editions, and was confined to ten pages in that of 1614.\r\nThe last of the German editions appeared in 1628.[177] The earliest\r\nundoubted Latin text[178] appeared at Basle in 1550, with the same\r\nseries of new views, etc., by Manuel Deutsch, which were given in the\r\nGerman edition of that date.[179] With nothing but a change of title\r\napparently, there were reissues of this edition in 1551, 1552, and\r\n1554,[180] and again in 1559.[181] The edition of 1572 has the same\r\nmap, “Novæ insulæ,” used in the 1554 editions; but new names are added,\r\nand new plates of Cusco and Cuba are also furnished.[182]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MÜNSTER.\r\n\r\nFac-simile of a cut in Reusner’s _Icones_ (Strasburg, 1590), p. 171.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest French edition, according to Brunet,[183] appeared in\r\n1552; and other editions followed in that language.[184] Eden gave the\r\nfifth book an English dress in 1553, which was again issued in 1572 and\r\n1574.[185] A Bohemian edition, made by Jan z Puchowa, _Kozmograffia\r\nCzieská_, was issued in 1554.[186] The first Italian edition was\r\nprinted at Basle in 1558, using the engraved plates of the other\r\nBasle issues; and finally, in 1575, an Italian edition, according to\r\nBrunet,[187] appeared at Colonia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONARDES.]\r\n\r\nThe best-known collection of voyages of the sixteenth century is that\r\nof Ramusio, whose third volume—compiled probably in 1553, and printed\r\nin 1556—is given exclusively to American voyages.[188] It contains,\r\nhowever, little regarding Columbus not given by Peter Martyr and\r\nOviedo, except the letter to Fracastoro.[189] In Ramusio the narratives\r\nof these early voyages first got a careful and considerate editor, who\r\nat this time was ripe in knowledge and experience, for he was well\r\nbeyond sixty,[190] and he had given his maturer years to historical\r\nand geographical study. He had at one time maintained a school for\r\ntopographical studies in his own house. Oviedo tells us of the\r\nassistance Ramusio was to him in his work. Locke has praised his labors\r\nwithout stint.[191]\r\n\r\nMonardes, one of the distinguished Spanish physicians of this time, was\r\nbusy seeking for the simples and curatives of the New World plants,\r\nas the adventurers to New Spain brought them back. The original issue\r\nof his work was the _Dos Libros_, published at Seville in 1565,\r\ntreating “of all things brought from our West Indies which are used in\r\nmedicine, and of the Bezaar Stone, and the herb Escuerçonera.” This\r\nbook is become rare, and is priced as high as 200 francs and £9.[192]\r\nThe “segunda parte” is sometimes found separately with the date 1571;\r\nbut in 1574 a third part was printed with the other two,—making the\r\ncomplete work, _Historia medicinal de nuestras Indias_,—and these were\r\nagain issued in 1580.[193] An Italian version, by Annibale Briganti,\r\nappeared at Venice in 1575 and 1589,[194] and a French, with Du Jardin,\r\nin 1602.[195] There were three English editions printed under the title\r\nof _Joyfull Newes out of the newe founde world, wherein is declared the\r\nrare and singular virtues of diverse and sundry Herbes, Trees, Oyles,\r\nPlantes, and Stones, by Doctor Monardus of Sevill, Englished by John\r\nFrampton_, which first appeared in 1577, and was reprinted in 1580,\r\nwith additions from Monardes’ other tracts, and again in 1596.[196]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish historians of affairs in Mexico, Peru, and Florida are\r\ngrouped in the _Hispanicarum rerum scriptores_, published at Frankfort\r\nin 1579-1581, in three volumes.[197] Of Richard Hakluyt and his several\r\ncollections,—the _Divers Voyages_ of 1582, the _Principall Navigations_\r\nof 1589, and his enlarged edition, of which the third volume (1600)\r\nrelates to America,—there is an account in Vol. III. of the present\r\nwork.[198]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF DE BRY.\r\n\r\nThis follows a print given in fac-simile in the _Carter-Brown\r\nCatalogue_, i. 316.]\r\n\r\nThe great undertaking of De Bry was also begun towards the close\r\nof the same century. De Bry was an engraver at Frankfort, and his\r\nprofessional labors had made him acquainted with works of travel. The\r\ninfluence of Hakluyt and a visit to the English editor stimulated him\r\nto undertake a task similar to that of the English compiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FEYERABEND.\r\n\r\nSigmund Feyerabend was a prominent bookseller of his day in Frankfort,\r\nand was born about 1527 or 1528. He was an engraver himself, and was\r\nassociated with De Bry in the publications of his _Voyages_.]\r\n\r\nHe resolved to include both the Old and New World; and he finally\r\nproduced his volumes simultaneously in Latin and German. As he gave\r\na larger size to the American parts than to the others, the commonly\r\nused title, referring to this difference, was soon established as\r\n_Grands et petits voyages_.[199] Theodore De Bry himself died in March,\r\n1598; but the work was carried forward by his widow, by his sons John\r\nTheodore and John Israel, and by his sons-in-law Matthew Merian and\r\nWilliam Fitzer. The task was not finished till 1634, when twenty-five\r\nparts had been printed in the Latin, of which thirteen pertain to\r\nAmerica; but the German has one more part in the American series.\r\nHis first part—which was Hariot’s _Virginia_—was printed not only in\r\nLatin and German, but also in the original English[200] and in French;\r\nbut there seeming to be no adequate demand in these languages, the\r\nsubsequent issues were confined to Latin and German. There was a gap in\r\nthe dates of publication between 1600 (when the ninth part is called\r\n“postrema pars”) and 1619-1620, when the tenth and eleventh parts\r\nappeared at Oppenheim, and a twelfth at Frankfort in 1624. A thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth part appeared in German in 1628 and 1630; and these,\r\ntranslated together into Latin, completed the Latin series in 1634.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting any bibliographical description,[201] the succession\r\nand editions of the American parts will be briefly enumerated:—\r\n\r\n=I.= _Hariot’s Virginia._ In Latin, English, German, and French, in\r\n1590; four or more impressions of the Latin the same year. Other\r\neditions of the German in 1600 and 1620.\r\n\r\n=II=. _Le Moyne’s Florida._ In Latin, 1591 and 1609; in German, 1591,\r\n1603.\r\n\r\n=III.= _Von Staden’s Brazil._ In Latin, 1592, 1605, 1630; in German,\r\n1593 (twice).\r\n\r\n=IV.= _Benzoni’s New World._ In Latin, 1594 (twice), 1644; in German,\r\n1594, 1613.\r\n\r\n=V.= _Continuation of Benzoni._ In Latin, 1595 (twice); in German, two\r\neditions without date, probably 1595 and 1613.\r\n\r\n=VI.= _Continuation of Benzoni (Peru)._ In Latin, 1596, 1597, 1617; in\r\nGerman, 1597, 1619.\r\n\r\n=VII.= _Schmidel’s Brazil._ In Latin, 1599, 1625; in German, 1597,\r\n1600, 1617.\r\n\r\n=VIII.= _Drake, Candish, and Ralegh._ In Latin, 1599 (twice), 1625; in\r\nGerman, 1599, 1624.\r\n\r\n=IX.= _Acosta_, etc. In Latin, 1602, 1633; in German, probably 1601;\r\n“additamentum,” 1602; and again entire after 1620.\r\n\r\n=X.= _Vespucius, Hamor, and John Smith._ In Latin, 1619 (twice); in\r\nGerman, 1618.\r\n\r\n=XI.= _Schouten and Spilbergen._ In Latin, 1619,—appendix, 1620; in\r\nGerman, 1619,—appendix, 1620.\r\n\r\n=XII.= _Herrera._ In Latin, 1624; in German, 1623.\r\n\r\n=XIII.= _Miscellaneous_,—_Cabot_, etc. In Latin, 1634; in German, the\r\nfirst seven sections in 1627 (sometimes 1628); and sections 8-15 in\r\n1630.\r\n\r\n_Elenchus: Historia Americæ sive Novus orbis_, 1634 (three issues).\r\nThis is a table of the Contents to the edition which Merian was selling\r\nin 1634 under a collective title.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing enumeration makes no recognition of the almost\r\ninnumerable varieties caused by combination, which sometimes pass for\r\nnew editions. Some of the editions of the same date are usually called\r\n“counterfeits;” and there are doubts, even, if some of those here named\r\nreally deserve recognition as distinct editions.[202]\r\n\r\nWhile there is distinctive merit in De Bry’s collection, which caused\r\nit to have a due effect in its day on the progress of geographical\r\nknowledge,[203] it must be confessed that a certain meretricious\r\nreputation has become attached to the work as the test of a collector’s\r\nassiduity, and of his supply of money, quite disproportioned to\r\nthe relative use of the collection in these days to a student.\r\nThis artificial appreciation has no doubt been largely due to the\r\nengravings, which form so attractive a feature in the series, and\r\nwhich, while they in many cases are the honest rendering of genuine\r\nsketches, are certainly in not a few the merest fancy of some\r\ndesigner.[204]\r\n\r\nThere are several publications of the De Brys sometimes found grouped\r\nwith the _Voyages_ as a part, though not properly so, of the series.\r\nSuch are Las Casas’ _Narratio regionum Indicarum_; the voyages of the\r\n“Silberne Welt,” by Arthus von Dantzig, and of Olivier van Noort;[205]\r\nthe _Rerum et urbis Amstelodamensium historia_ of Pontanus, with its\r\nDutch voyages to the north; and the _Navigations aux Indes par les\r\nHollandois_.[206]\r\n\r\nAnother of De Bry’s editors, Gasper Ens, published in 1680 his\r\n_West-unnd-Ost Indischer Lustgart_, which is a summary of the sources\r\nof American history.[207]\r\n\r\nThere are various abridgments of De Bry. The earliest is Ziegler’s\r\n_America_, Frankfort, 1614,[208] which is made up from the first nine\r\nparts of the German _Grands Voyages_. The _Historia antipodum, oder\r\nNewe Welt_ (1631), is the first twelve parts condensed by Johann Ludwig\r\nGottfried, otherwise known as Johann Phillippe Abelin, who was, in\r\nMerian’s day, a co-laborer on the _Voyages_. He uses a large number of\r\nthe plates from the larger work.[209] The chief rival collection of De\r\nBry is that of Hulsius, which is described elsewhere.[210]\r\n\r\nCollections now became numerous. Conrad Löw’s _Meer oder Seehanen Buch_\r\nwas published at Cologne in 1598.[211] The Dutch Collection of Voyages,\r\nissued by Cornelius Claesz, appeared in uniform style between 1598 and\r\n1603, but it never had a collective title. It gives the voyages of\r\nCavendish and Drake.[212]\r\n\r\nIt was well into the next century (1613) when Purchas began his\r\npublications, of which there is an account elsewhere.[213] Hieronymus\r\nMegiser’s _Septentrio novantiquus_ was published at Leipsic in 1613.\r\nIn a single volume it gave the Zeni and later accounts of the North,\r\nbesides narratives pertaining to New France and Virginia.[214] The\r\n_Journalen van de Reysen op Oostindie_ of Michael Colijn, published\r\nat Amsterdam in 1619, is called by Muller[215] the first series of\r\nvoyages published in Dutch with a collective title. It includes,\r\nnotwithstanding the title, Cavendish, Drake, and Raleigh. Another Dutch\r\nfolio, Herckmans’ _Der Zeevaert lof_, etc. (Amsterdam, 1634), does not\r\ninclude any American voyages.[216] The celebrated Dutch collection,\r\nedited by Isaac Commelin, at Amsterdam, and known as the _Begin en\r\nVoortgangh van de Oost-Indische Compagnie_, would seem originally to\r\nhave included, among its voyages to the East and North,[217] those of\r\nRaleigh and Cavendish; but they were later omitted.[218]\r\n\r\nThe collection of Thevenot was issued in 1663; but this has been\r\ndescribed elsewhere.[219] The collection usually cited as Dapper’s was\r\nprinted at Amsterdam, 1669-1729, in folio (thirteen volumes). It has no\r\ncollective title, but among the volumes are two touching America,—the\r\n_Beschrijvinge_ of Montanus,[220] and Nienhof’s _Brasiliaansche Zee-en\r\nLantreize_.[221] A small collection, _Recueil de divers voyages faits\r\nen Africa et en l’Amérique_,[222] was published in Paris by Billaine\r\nin 1674. It includes Blome’s Jamaica, Laborde on the Caribs, etc. Some\r\nof the later American voyages were also printed in the second edition\r\nof a Swedish _Reesa-book_, printed at Wysingzborg in 1674, 1675.[223]\r\nThe Italian collection, _Il genio vagante_, was printed at Parma in\r\n1691-1693, in four volumes.\r\n\r\n_An Account of Several Voyages_ (London, 1694) gives Narborough’s to\r\nMagellan’s Straits, and Marten’s to Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe important English _Collection of Voyages and Travels_ which passes\r\nunder the name of its publisher, Churchill, took its earliest form\r\nin 1704, appearing in four volumes; but was afterwards increased by\r\ntwo additional volumes in 1733, and by two more in 1744,—these last,\r\nsometimes called the _Oxford Voyages_, being made up from material in\r\nthe library of the Earl of Oxford. It was reissued complete in 1752. It\r\nhas an introductory discourse by Caleb Locke; and this, and some other\r\nof its contents, constitutes the _Histoire de la navigation_, Paris,\r\n1722.[224]\r\n\r\nJohn Harris, an English divine, had compiled a _Collection of Voyages_\r\nin 1702 which was a rival of Churchill’s, differing from it in being\r\nan historical summary of all voyages, instead of a collection of some.\r\nHarris wrote the Introduction; but it is questionable how much else he\r\nhad to do with it.[225] It was revised and reissued in 1744-1748 by Dr.\r\nJohn Campbell, and in this form it is often regarded as a supplement\r\nto Churchill.[226] It was reprinted in two volumes, folio, with\r\ncontinuations to date, in 1764.[227]\r\n\r\nThe well-known Dutch collection (_Voyagien_) of Vander Aa was printed\r\nat Leyden in 1706, 1707. It gives voyages to all parts of the world\r\nmade between 1246 and 1693. He borrows from Herrera, Acosta, Purchas,\r\nDe Bry, and all available sources, and illuminates the whole with\r\nabout five hundred maps and plates. In its original form it made\r\ntwenty-eight, sometimes thirty, volumes of small size, in black-letter,\r\nand eight volumes in folio, both editions being issued at the same time\r\nand from the same type. In this larger form the voyages are arranged\r\nby nations; and it was the unsold copies of this edition which, with\r\na new general title, constitutes the edition of 1727. In the smaller\r\nform the arrangement is chronological. In the folio edition the voyages\r\nto Spanish America previous to 1540 constitute volumes three and four;\r\nwhile the English voyages, to 1696, are in volumes five and six.[228]\r\n\r\nIn 1707 Du Perier’s _Histoire universelle des voyages_ had not so\r\nwide a scope as its title indicated, being confined to the early\r\nSpanish voyages to America;[229] the proposed subsequent volumes\r\nnot having been printed. An English translation, under Du Perier’s\r\nname, was issued in London in 1708;[230] but when reissued in 1711,\r\nwith a different title, it credited the authorship to the Abbé\r\nBellegarde.[231] In 1711, also, Captain John Stevens published in\r\nLondon his _New Collection of Voyages_; but Lawson’s Carolina and\r\nCieza’s Peru were the only American sections.[232] In 1715 the French\r\ncollection known as Bernard’s _Recueil de voiages au Nord_, was begun\r\nat Amsterdam. A pretty wide interpretation is given to the restricted\r\ndesignation of the title, and voyages to California, Louisiana, the\r\nUpper Mississippi (Hennepin), Virginia, and Georgia are included.[233]\r\nDaniel Coxe, in 1741, united in one volume _A Collection of Voyages_,\r\nthree of which he had already printed separately, including Captain\r\nJames’s to the Northwest. A single volume of a collection called _The\r\nAmerican Traveller_ appeared in London in 1743.[234]\r\n\r\nThe collection known as _Astley’s Voyages_ was published in London in\r\nfour volumes in 1745-1747; the editor was John Green, whose name is\r\nsometimes attached to the work. It gives the travels of Marco Polo,\r\nbut has nothing of the early voyages to America,[235]—these being\r\nintended for later volumes, were never printed. These four volumes were\r\ntranslated, with some errors and omissions, into French, and constitute\r\nthe first nine volumes of the Abbé Prevost’s _Histoire générale des\r\nvoyages_, begun in Paris in 1746, and completed, in twenty quarto\r\nvolumes, in 1789.[236] An octavo edition was printed (1749-1770) in\r\nseventy-five volumes.[237] It was again reprinted at the Hague in\r\ntwenty-five volumes quarto (1747-1780), with considerable revision,\r\nfollowing the original English, and with Green’s assistance; besides\r\nshowing some additions. The Dutch editor was P. de Hondt, who also\r\nissued an edition in Dutch in twenty-one volumes quarto,—including,\r\nhowever, only the first seventeen volumes of his French edition, thus\r\nomitting those chiefly concerning America.[238] A small collection\r\nof little moment, _A New Universal Collection of Voyages_, appeared\r\nin London in 1755.[239] De Brosses’ Histoire des navigations aux\r\nterres australes depuis 1501 (Paris, 1756), two volumes quarto, covers\r\nVespucius, Magellan, Drake, and Cavendish.[240]\r\n\r\nSeveral English collections appeared in the next few years; among which\r\nare _The World Displayed_ (London, 1759-1761), twenty vols. 16mo,—of\r\nwhich seven volumes are on American voyages, compiled from the larger\r\ncollections,[241]—and _A Curious Collection of Travels_ (London, 1761)\r\nis in eight volumes, three of which are devoted to America.[242]\r\n\r\nThe Abbé de la Porte’s _Voyageur François_, in forty-two volumes,\r\n1765-1795 (there are other dates), may be mentioned to warn the\r\nstudent of its historical warp with a fictitious woof.[243] John\r\nBarrows’ _Collection of Voyages_ (London, 1765), in three small\r\nvolumes, was translated into French by Targe under the title of _Abrégé\r\nchronologique_. John Callender’s _Voyages to the Terra australis_\r\n(London, 1766-1788), three volumes, translated for the first time a\r\nnumber of the narratives in De Bry, Hulsius, and Thevenot. It gives\r\nthe voyages of Vespucius, Magellan, Drake, Galle, Cavendish, Hawkins,\r\nand others.[244] Dodsley’s _Compendium of Voyages_ was published\r\nin the same year (1766) in seven volumes.[245] The _New Collection\r\nof Voyages_, generally referred to as Knox’s, from the publisher’s\r\nname, appeared in seven volumes in 1767, the first three volumes\r\ncovering American explorations.[246] In 1770 Edward Cavendish Drake’s\r\n_New Universal Collection of Voyages_ was published at London. The\r\nnarratives are concise, and of a very popular character.[247] David\r\nHenry, a magazinist of the day, published in 1773-1774 _An Historical\r\nAccount of all the Voyages Round the World by English Navigators_,\r\nbeginning with Drake and Cavendish.[248]\r\n\r\nLa Harpe issued in Paris, 1780-1801, in thirty-two volumes,—Comeyras\r\nediting the last eleven,—his _Abrégé de l’histoire générale des\r\nvoyages_, which proved a more readable and popular book than Prévost’s\r\ncollection. There have been later editions and continuations.[249]\r\n\r\nJohann Reinhold Forster made a positive contribution to this field\r\nof compilation when he printed his _Geschichte der Entdeckungen und\r\nSchifffahrten im Norden_ at Frankfort in 1785.[250] He goes back to\r\nthe earliest explorations, and considers the credibility of the Zeno\r\nnarrative. He starts with Gomez for the Spanish section. A French\r\ncollection by Berenger, _Voyages faits autour du monde_ (Paris,\r\n1788-1789), is very scant on Magellan, Drake, and Cavendish. A\r\ncollection was published in London (1789) by Richardson on the voyages\r\nof the Portuguese and Spaniards during the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies. Mavor’s _Voyages, Travels, and Discoveries_ (London,\r\n1796-1802), twenty-five volumes, is a condensed treatment, which passed\r\nto other editions in 1810 and 1813-1815.\r\n\r\nA standard compilation appeared in John Pinkerton’s _General Collection\r\nof Voyages_ (London, 1808-1814), in seventeen volumes,[251] with over\r\ntwo hundred maps and plates, repeating the essential English narratives\r\nof earlier collections, and translating those from foreign languages\r\nafresh, preserving largely the language of the explorers. Pinkerton, as\r\nan editor, was learned, but somewhat pedantic and over-confident; and\r\na certain agglutinizing habit indicates a process of amassment rather\r\nthan of selection and assimilation. Volumes xii., xiii., and xiv. are\r\ngiven to America; but the operations of the Spaniards on the main, and\r\nparticularly on the Pacific coast of North America, are rather scantily\r\nchronicled.[252]\r\n\r\nIn 1808 was begun, under the supervision of Malte-Brun and others, the\r\nwell-known _Annales des voyages_, which was continued to 1815, making\r\ntwenty-five volumes. A new series, _Nouvelles annales des voyages_, was\r\nbegun in 1819. The whole work is an important gathering of original\r\nsources and learned comment, and is in considerable part devoted to\r\nAmerica. A French _Collection abrégée des voyages_, by Bancarel,\r\nappeared in Paris in 1808-1809, in twelve volumes.\r\n\r\n_The Collection of the best Voyages and Travels_, compiled by Robert\r\nKerr, and published in Edinburgh in 1811-1824, in eighteen octavo\r\nvolumes, is a useful one, though the scheme was not wholly carried\r\nout. It includes an historical essay on the progress of navigation\r\nand discovery by W. Stevenson. It also includes among others the\r\nNorthmen and Zeni voyages, the travels of Marco Polo and Galvano, the\r\nAfrican discoveries of the Portuguese. The voyages of Columbus and his\r\nsuccessors begin in vol. iii.; and the narratives of these voyages are\r\ncontinued through vol. vi., though those of Drake, Cavendish, Hawkins,\r\nDavis, Magellan, and others come later in the series.\r\n\r\nThe _Histoire générale des voyages_, undertaken by C. A. Walkenaer in\r\n1826, was stopped in 1831, after twenty-one octavos had been printed,\r\nwithout exhausting the African portion.\r\n\r\nThe early Dutch voyages are commemorated in Bennet and Wijk’s\r\n_Nederlandsche Ontdekkingen in America_, etc., which was issued at\r\nUtrecht in 1827,[253] and in their _Nederlandsche Zeereizen_, printed\r\nat Dordrecht in 1828-1830, in five volumes octavo. It contains\r\nLinschoten, Hudson, etc.\r\n\r\nAlbert Montémont’s _Bibliothèque universelle des voyages_ was published\r\nin Paris, 1833-1836, in forty-six volumes.\r\n\r\nG. A. Wimmer’s _Die Enthüllung des Erdkreises_ (Vienna, 1834), five\r\nvolumes octavo, is a general summary, which gives in the last two\r\nvolumes the voyages to America and to the South Seas.[254]\r\n\r\nIn 1837 Henri Ternaux-Compans began the publication of his _Voyages,\r\nrelations, et mémoires originaux pour servir à l’histoire de la\r\ndécouverte de l’Amérique_, of which an account is given on another page\r\n(see p. vi).\r\n\r\nThe collection of F. C. Marmocchi, _Raccolta di viaggi dalla scoperta\r\ndel Nuevo Continente_, was published at Prato in 1840-1843, in five\r\nvolumes; it includes the Navarrete collection on Columbus, Xeres on\r\nPizarro, and other of the Spanish narratives.[255] The last volume of a\r\ncollection in twelve volumes published in Paris, _Nouvelle bibliothèque\r\ndes voyages_, is also given to America.\r\n\r\nThe Hakluyt Society in London began its valuable series of publications\r\nin 1847, and has admirably kept up its work to the present time,\r\nhaving issued its volumes generally under satisfactory editing. Its\r\npublications are not sold outside of its membership, except at second\r\nhand.[256]\r\n\r\nUnder the editing of José Ferrer de Couto and José March y Labores,\r\nand with the royal patronage, a _Historia de la marina real Española_\r\nwas published in Madrid, in two volumes, 1849 and 1854. It relates the\r\nearly voyages.[257] Édouard Charton’s _Voyageurs anciens et modernes_\r\nwas published in four volumes in Paris, 1855-1857; and it passed\r\nsubsequently to a new edition.[258]\r\n\r\nA summarized account of the Portuguese and Spanish discoveries, from\r\nPrince Henry to Pizarro, was published in German by Theodor Vogel, and\r\nalso in English in 1877.\r\n\r\nA _Nouvelle histoire des voyages_, by Richard Cortambert, is the\r\nlatest and most popular presentation of the subject, opening with the\r\nexplorations of Columbus and his successors; and Édouard Cat’s _Les\r\ngrandes découvertes maritimes du treizième au seizième siècle_ (Paris,\r\n1882) is another popular book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE AND CRITICAL\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE ANCIENTS CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM H. TILLINGHAST,\r\n\r\n_Assistant Librarian of Harvard University._\r\n\r\n\r\nAS Columbus, in August, 1498, ran into the mouth of the Orinoco,\r\nhe little thought that before him lay, silent but irrefutable, the\r\nproof of the futility of his long-cherished hopes. His gratification\r\nat the completeness of his success, in that God had permitted the\r\naccomplishment of all his predictions, to the confusion of those who\r\nhad opposed and derided him, never left him; even in the fever which\r\novertook him on the last voyage his strong faith cried to him, “Why\r\ndost thou falter in thy trust in God? He gave thee India!” In this\r\nbelief he died. The conviction that Hayti was Cipangu, that Cuba was\r\nCathay, did not long outlive its author; the discovery of the Pacific\r\nsoon made it clear that a new world and another sea lay between the\r\nlandfall of Columbus and the goal of his endeavors.\r\n\r\nThe truth, when revealed and accepted, was a surprise more profound\r\nto the learned than even the error it displaced. The possibility of\r\na short passage westward to Cathay was important to merchants and\r\nadventurers, startling to courtiers and ecclesiastics, but to men of\r\nclassical learning it was only a corroboration of the teaching of the\r\nancients. That a barrier to such passage should be detected in the very\r\nspot where the outskirts of Asia had been imagined, was unexpected\r\nand unwelcome. The treasures of Mexico and Peru could not satisfy\r\nthe demand for the products of the East; Cortes gave himself, in his\r\nlater years, to the search for a strait which might yet make good the\r\nanticipations of the earlier discoverers. The new interpretation, if\r\neconomically disappointing, had yet an interest of its own. Whence came\r\nthe human population of the unveiled continent? How had its existence\r\nescaped the wisdom of Greece and Rome? Had it done so? Clearly, since\r\nthe whole human race had been renewed through Noah, the red men of\r\nAmerica must have descended from the patriarch; in some way, at some\r\ntime, the New World had been discovered and populated from the Old.\r\nHad knowledge of this event lapsed from the minds of men before their\r\nmemories were committed to writing, or did reminiscences exist in\r\nancient literatures, overlooked, or misunderstood by modern ignorance?\r\nScholars were not wanting, nor has their line since wholly failed, who\r\nfreely devoted their ingenuity to the solution of these questions, but\r\nwith a success so diverse in its results, that the inquiry is still\r\npertinent, especially since the pursuit, even though on the main point\r\nit end in reservation of judgment, enables us to understand from what\r\nsource and by what channels the inspiration came which held Columbus so\r\nsteadily to his westward course.\r\n\r\nAlthough the elder civilizations of Assyria and Egypt boasted a\r\ncultivation of astronomy long anterior to the heroic age of Greece,\r\ntheir cosmographical ideas appear to have been rude and undeveloped,\r\nso that whatever the Greeks borrowed thence was of small importance\r\ncompared with what they themselves ascertained. While it may be doubted\r\nif decisive testimony can be extorted from the earliest Grecian\r\nliterature, represented chiefly by the Homeric and Hesiodic poems, it\r\nis probable that the people among whom that literature grew up had not\r\ngone, in their conception of the universe, beyond simple acceptance\r\nof the direct evidence of their senses. The earth they looked upon\r\nas a plane, stretching away from the Ægean Sea, the focus of their\r\nknowledge, and ever less distinctly known, until it ended in an horizon\r\nof pure ignorance, girdled by the deep-flowing current of the river\r\nOceanus. Beyond Oceanus even fancy began to fail: there was the realm\r\nof dust and darkness, the home of the powerless spirits of the dead;\r\nthere, too, the hemisphere of heaven joined its brother hemisphere of\r\nTartarus.[259] This conception of the earth was not confined to Homeric\r\ntimes, but remained the common belief throughout the course of Grecian\r\nhistory, underlying and outlasting many of the speculations of the\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nThat growing intellectual activity which was signalized by a notable\r\ndevelopment of trade and colonization in the eighth century, in the\r\nseventh awoke to consciousness in a series of attempts to formulate\r\nthe conditions of existence. The philosophy of nature thus originated,\r\nwherein the testimony of nature in her own behalf was little sought\r\nor understood, began with the assumption of a flat earth, variously\r\nshaped, and as variously supported. To whom belongs the honor of first\r\npropounding the theory of the spherical form of the earth cannot be\r\nknown. It was taught by the Italian Pythagoreans of the sixth century,\r\nand was probably one of the doctrines of Pythagoras himself, as it was,\r\na little later, of Parmenides, the founder of the Eleatics.[260]\r\n\r\nIn neither case can there be a claim for scientific discovery. The\r\nearth was a sphere because the sphere was the most perfect form; it was\r\nat the centre of the universe because that was the place of honor; it\r\nwas motionless because motion was less dignified than rest.\r\n\r\nPlato, who was familiar with the doctrines of the Pythagoreans, adopted\r\ntheir view of the form of the earth, and did much to popularize it\r\namong his countrymen.[261] To the generation that succeeded him, the\r\nsphericity of the earth was a fact as capable of logical demonstration\r\nas a geometrical theorem. Aristotle, in his treatise “On the Heaven,”\r\nafter detailing the views of those philosophers who regarded the\r\nearth as flat, drum-shaped, or cylindrical, gives a formal summary\r\nof the grounds which necessitate the assumption of its sphericity,\r\nspecifying the tendency of all things to seek the centre, the unvarying\r\ncircularity of the earth’s shadow at eclipses of the moon, and the\r\nproportionate change in the altitude of stars resulting from changes\r\nin the observer’s latitude. Aristotle made the doctrine orthodox; his\r\nsuccessors, Eratosthenes, Hipparchus, and Ptolemy, constituted it an\r\ninalienable possession of the race. Greece transmitted it to Rome, Rome\r\nimpressed it upon barbaric Europe; taught by Pliny, Hyginus, Manilius,\r\nexpressed in the works of Cicero, Virgil, Ovid, it passed into the\r\nschool-books of the Middle Ages, whence, reinforced by Arabian lore, it\r\nhas come down to us.[262]\r\n\r\nThat the belief ever became in antiquity or in the Middle Ages widely\r\nspread among the people is improbable; it did not indeed escape\r\nopposition among the educated; writers even of the Augustan age\r\nsometimes appear in doubt.[263]\r\n\r\nThe sphericity of the earth once comprehended, there follow certain\r\ncorollaries which the Greeks were not slow to perceive. Plato, indeed,\r\nwho likened the earth to a ball covered with party-colored strips\r\nof leather, gives no estimate of its size, although the description\r\nof the world in the _Phaedo_ seems to imply immense magnitude;[264]\r\nbut Aristotle states that mathematicians of his day estimated the\r\ncircumference at 400,000 stadia,[265] and Archimedes puts the common\r\nreckoning at somewhat less than 300,000 stadia.[266] How these figures\r\nwere obtained we are not informed. The first measurement of the earth\r\nwhich rests on a known method was that made about the middle of the\r\nthird century B.C., by Eratosthenes, the librarian at Alexandria, who,\r\nby comparing the estimated linear distance between Syene, under the\r\ntropic, and Alexandria with their angular distance, as deduced from\r\nobservations on the shadow of the gnomon at Alexandria, concluded that\r\nthe circumference of the earth was 250,000 or 252,000 stadia.[267] This\r\nresult, owing to an uncertainty as to the exact length of the stade\r\nused in the computation, cannot be interpreted with confidence, but\r\nif we assume that it was in truth about twelve per cent. too large,\r\nwe shall probably not be far out of the way.[268] Hipparchus, in many\r\nmatters the opponent of Eratosthenes, adopted his conclusion on this\r\npoint, and was followed by Strabo,[269] by Pliny, who regarded the\r\nattempt as somewhat over-bold, but so cleverly argued that it could not\r\nbe disregarded,[270] and by many others.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as it resulted, this overestimate was not allowed to stand\r\nuncontested. Posidonius of Rhodes (B.C. 135-51), by an independent\r\ncalculation based upon the difference in altitude of Canopus at Rhodes\r\nand at Alexandria, reached a result which is reported by Cleomedes\r\nas 240,000, and by Strabo as 180,000 stadia.[271] The final judgment\r\nof Posidonius apparently approved the smaller number; it hit, at all\r\nevents, the fancy of the time, and was adopted by Marinus of Tyre and\r\nby Ptolemy,[272] whose authority imposed it upon the Middle Ages.\r\nAccepting it as an independent estimate, it follows that Posidonius\r\nallowed but 500 stadia to a degree, instead of 700, thus representing\r\nthe earth as about 28 per cent. smaller than did Eratosthenes.[273]\r\n\r\nTo the earliest writers the known lands constituted the earth; they\r\nwere girdled, indeed, by the river Oceanus, but that was a narrow\r\nstream whose further bank lay in fable-land.[274] The promulgation\r\nof the theory of the sphericity of the earth and the approximate\r\ndetermination of its size drew attention afresh to the problem of\r\nthe distribution of land and water upon its surface, and materially\r\nmodified the earlier conception. The increase of geographical knowledge\r\nalong lines of trade, conquest, and colonization had greatly extended\r\nthe bounds of the known world since Homer’s day, but it was still\r\nevident that by far the larger portion of the earth, taking the\r\nsmallest estimate of its size, was still undiscovered,—a fair field for\r\nspeculation and fantasy.[275]\r\n\r\nWe can trace two schools of thought in respect to the configuration\r\nof this unknown region, both represented in the primitive conception\r\nof the earth, and both conditioned by a more fundamental postulate. It\r\nwas a near thought, if the earth was a sphere, to transfer to it the\r\nsystems of circles which had already been applied to the heavens. The\r\nsuggestion is attributed to Thales, to Pythagoras, and to Parmenides;\r\nand it is certain that the earth was very early conceived as divided\r\nby the polar and solstitial circles into five zones, whereof two only,\r\nthe temperate in either sphere, so the Greeks believed, were capable\r\nof supporting life; of the others, the polar were uninhabitable from\r\nintense cold, as was the torrid from its parching heat. This theory,\r\nwhich excluded from knowledge the whole southern hemisphere and a large\r\nportion of the northern, was approved by Aristotle and the Homeric\r\nschool of geographers, and by the minor physicists. As knowledge grew,\r\nits truth was doubted. Polybius wrote a monograph, maintaining that the\r\nmiddle portion of the torrid zone had a temperate climate, and his view\r\nwas adopted by Posidonius and Geminus, if not by Eratosthenes. Marinus\r\nand Ptolemy, who knew that commerce was carried on along the east coast\r\nof Africa far below the equator, cannot have fallen into the ancient\r\nerror, but the error long persisted; it was always in favor with the\r\ncompilers, and thus perhaps obtained that currency in Rome which\r\nenabled it to exert a restrictive and pernicious check upon maritime\r\nendeavor deep into the Middle Ages.[276]\r\n\r\nUpon the question of the distribution of land and water, unanimity\r\nno longer prevailed. By some it was maintained that there was one\r\nocean, confluent over the whole globe, so that the body of known\r\nlands, that so-called continent, was in truth an island, and whatever\r\nother inhabitable regions might exist were in like manner surrounded\r\nand so separated by vast expanses of untraversed waves. Such was the\r\nview, scarcely more than a survival of the ocean-river of the poets\r\ndeprived of its further bank by the assumption of the sphericity of\r\nthe earth, held by Aristotle,[277] Crates of Mallus, Strabo, Pliny,\r\nand many others. If this be called the oceanic theory, we may speak of\r\nits opposite as the continental: according to this view, the existing\r\nland so far exceeded the water in extent that it formed in truth the\r\ncontinent, holding the seas quite separate within its hollows. The\r\norigin of the theory is obscure, even though we recall that Homer’s\r\nocean was itself contained. It was strikingly presented by Plato in the\r\n_Phaedo_, and is implied in the Atlantis myth; it may be recalled, too,\r\nthat Herodotus, often depicted as a monster of credulity, had broken\r\nthe bondage of the ocean-river, because he could not satisfy himself of\r\nthe existence of the ocean in the east or north; and while reluctantly\r\nadmitting that Africa was surrounded by water, considered Gaul to\r\nextend indefinitely westward.[278] Hipparchus revived the doctrine,\r\nteaching that Africa divided the Indian Ocean from the Atlantic in the\r\nsouth, so that these seas lay in separate basins. The existence of an\r\nequatorial branch of the ocean, a favorite dogma of the other school,\r\nwas also denied by Polybius, Posidonius, and Geminus.[279]\r\n\r\nThe reports of traders and explorers led Marinus to a like conclusion;\r\nboth he and Ptolemy, misinterpreting their information, believed\r\nthat the eastern coast of Asia ran south instead of north, and they\r\nunited it with the eastern trend of Africa, supposing at the same time\r\nthat the two continents met also in the west.[280] The continental\r\ntheory, despite its famous disciples, made no headway at Rome, and was\r\nconsequently hardly known to the Middle Ages before its falsity was\r\nproved by the circumnavigation of Africa.[281]\r\n\r\nThat portion of Europe, Asia, and Africa known to the ancients, whether\r\nregarded as an island, or as separated from the rest of the world by\r\nclimatic conditions merely, or by ignorance, formed a distinct concept\r\nand was known by a particular name, _ἡ οἰκουμένη_. Originally supposed\r\nto be circular, it was later thought to be oblong and as having a\r\nlength more than double its width. Those who believed in its insularity\r\nlikened its shape to a sling, or to an outspread chlamys or military\r\ncloak, and assumed that it lay wholly within the northern hemisphere.\r\nIn absolute figures, the length of the known world was placed by\r\nEratosthenes at 77,800 stadia, and by Strabo at 70,000. The latter\r\nfigure remained the common estimate until Marinus of Tyre, in the\r\nsecond century a.d., receiving direct information from the silk-traders\r\nof a caravan route to China, substituted the portentous exaggeration of\r\n90,000 stadia on the parallel of Rhodes, or 225°. Ptolemy, who followed\r\nMarinus in many things, shrank from the naïveté whereby the Tyrian had\r\ninterpreted a seven months’ caravan journey to represent seven months’\r\ntravelling in a direct line at the rate of twenty miles a day, and cut\r\ndown his figures to 180°, or 72,000 stadia.[282] It appears, therefore,\r\nthat Strabo considered the known world as occupying not much over one\r\nthird of the circuit of the temperate zone, while Marinus, who adopted\r\n180,000 stadia as the measure of the earth, claimed a knowledge of\r\ntwo thirds of that zone, and supposed that land extended indefinitely\r\neastward beyond the limit of knowledge.\r\n\r\nWhat did the ancients picture to themselves of this unknown portion of\r\nthe globe? The more imaginative found there a home for ancient myth and\r\nmodern fable; the geographers, severely practical, excluded it from the\r\nscope of their survey; philosophers and physicists could easily supply\r\nfrom theory what they did not know as fact. Pythagoras, it is said, had\r\ntaught that the whole surface of the earth was inhabited. Aristotle\r\ndemonstrated that the southern hemisphere must have its temperate zone,\r\nwhere winds similar to our own prevailed; his successors elaborated the\r\nhint into a systematized nomenclature, whereby the inhabitants of the\r\nearth were divided into four classes, according to their location upon\r\nthe surface of the earth with relation to one another.[283]\r\n\r\nThis system was furthest developed by the oceanic school. The rival of\r\nEratosthenes, Crates of Mallus (who achieved fame by the construction\r\nof a large globe), assumed the existence of a southern continent,\r\nseparated from the known world by the equatorial ocean; it is possible\r\nthat he introduced the idea of providing a distinct residence for\r\neach class of earth-dwellers, by postulating four island continents,\r\none in each quarter of the globe. Eratosthenes probably thought that\r\nthere were inhabitable regions in the southern hemisphere, and Strabo\r\nadded that there might be two, or even more, habitable earths in the\r\nnorthern temperate zone, especially near the parallel of Rhodes.[284]\r\nCrates introduced his views at Rome, and the oceanic theory remained\r\na favorite with the Roman physicists. It was avowed by Pliny, who\r\nchampioned the existence of antipodes against the vulgar disbelief.\r\nIn the fine episode in the last book of Cicero’s _Republic_, the\r\nyounger Scipio relates a dream, wherein the elder hero of his name,\r\nScipio Africanus, conveying him to the lofty heights of the Milky Way,\r\nemphasized the futility of fame by showing him upon the earth the\r\nregions to which his name could never penetrate: “Thou seest in what\r\nfew places the earth is inhabited, and those how scant; great deserts\r\nlie between them, and they who dwell upon the earth are not only so\r\nscattered that naught can spread from one community to another, but so\r\nthat some live off in an oblique direction from you, some off toward\r\nthe side, and some even dwell directly opposite to you.”[285] Mela\r\nconfines himself to a mention of the _Antichthones_, who live in the\r\ntemperate zone in the south, and are cut off from us by the intervening\r\ntorrid zone.[286]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACROBIUS\r\n\r\nFrom _Macrobii Ambrosii Aurelii Theodosii in Somnium Scipionis, Lib.\r\nII._ (Lugduni, 1560).]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the southern continent, the other world, as it was\r\ncalled,[287] made a more distinct impression than the possible other\r\ncontinents in the northern hemisphere. Hipparchus thought that\r\nTrapobene might be a part of this southern world, and the idea that\r\nthe Nile had its source there was widespread: some supposing that it\r\nflowed beneath the equatorial ocean; others believing, with Ptolemy,\r\nthat Africa was connected with the southern continent. The latter\r\ndoctrine was shattered by the discovery of the Cape of Good Hope; but\r\nthe continent was revived when Tierra del Fuego, Australia, and New\r\nZealand were discovered, and attained gigantic size on the maps of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries only within the last two centuries\r\nhas it shrunk to the present limits of the antarctic ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACROBIUS\r\n\r\nFrom _Avr. Theodosii Macrobii Opera_ (Lipsiæ, 1774).]\r\n\r\nThe oceanic theory, and the doctrine of the Four Worlds, as it has been\r\ntermed,[288]_ terra quadrifiga_, was set forth in the greatest detail\r\nin a commentary on the Dream of Scipio, written by Macrobius, probably\r\nin the fifth century a.d. In the concussion and repulsion of the ocean\r\nstreams he found a sufficient cause for the phenomena of the tides.[289]\r\n\r\nSuch were the theories of the men of science, purely speculative,\r\noriginating in logic, not discovery, and they give no hint of actual\r\nknowledge regarding those distant regions with which they deal.\r\nFrom them we turn to examine the literature of the imagination, for\r\ngeography, by right the handmaid of history, is easily perverted to the\r\nservice of myth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACROBIUS\r\n\r\nAfter Santarem’s _Atlas_, as a “mappemonde tirée d’un manuscrit de\r\nMacrobe du Xème siècle.”]\r\n\r\nThe expanding horizon of the Greeks was always hedged with fable: in\r\nthe north was the realm of the happy Hyperboreans, beyond the blasts\r\nof Boreas; in the east, the wonderland of India; in the south, Panchæa\r\nand the blameless Ethiopians; nor did the west lack lingering places\r\nfor romance. Here was the floating isle of Æolus, brazen-walled; here\r\nthe mysterious Ogygia, navel of the sea;[290] and on the earth’s\r\nextremest verge were the Elysian Fields, the home of heroes exempt from\r\ndeath, “where life is easiest to man. No snow is there, nor yet great\r\nstorm nor any rain, but always ocean sendeth forth the breeze of the\r\nshrill west to blow cool on men.”[291] Across the ocean river, where\r\nwas the setting of the sun, all was changed. There was the home of the\r\nCimmerians, who dwelt in darkness; there the grove of Persephone and\r\nthe dreary house of the dead.[292]\r\n\r\nIn the Hesiodic poems the Elysian Fields are transformed into islands,\r\nthe home of the fourth race, the heroes, after death:—\r\n\r\n  “Them on earth’s utmost verge the god assign’d\r\n  A life, a seat, distinct from human kind:\r\n  Beside the deepening whirlpools of the main,\r\n  In those blest isles where Saturn holds his reign,\r\n  Apart from heaven’s immortals calm they share\r\n  A rest unsullied by the clouds of care:\r\n  And yearly thrice with sweet luxuriance crown’d\r\n  Springs the ripe harvest from the teeming ground.”[293]\r\n\r\n“Those who have had the courage to remain stedfast thrice in each life,\r\nand to keep their souls altogether from wrong,” sang Pindar, “pursue\r\nthe road of Zeus to the castle of Cronos, where o’er the isles of\r\nthe blest ocean breezes blow, and flowers gleam with gold, some from\r\nthe land on glistering trees, while others the water feeds; and with\r\nbracelets of these they entwine their hands and make crowns for their\r\nheads.”[294]\r\n\r\nThe Islands of the Blest, _μακάρων νῆσοι_, do not vanish henceforward\r\nfrom the world’s literature, but continue to haunt the Atlantic through\r\nthe Roman period and deep into the Middle Ages. In the west, too, were\r\nlocalized other and wilder myths; here were the scenes of the Perseus\r\nfable, the island of the weird and communistic sisters, the Graeae,\r\nand the Gorgonides, the homes of Medusa and her sister Gorgons, the\r\nbirthplace of the dread Chimaera.[295] The importance of the far west\r\nin the myths connected with Hercules is well known. In the traditionary\r\ntwelve labors the Greek hero is confused with his prototype the Tyrian\r\nMelkarth, and those labors which deal with the west were doubtless\r\nborrowed from the cult which the Greeks had found established at Gades\r\nwhen trade first led them thither. In the tenth labor it is the western\r\nisle Erytheia, which Hercules visits in the golden cup wherein Helios\r\nwas wont to make his nocturnal ocean voyage, and from which he returns\r\nwith the oxen of the giant Geryon. Even more famous was the search for\r\nthe apples of the Hesperides, which constituted the eleventh labor.\r\nThis golden fruit, the wedding gift produced by Gaa for Hera, the\r\nprudent goddess, doubtful of the security of Olympus, gave in charge\r\nto the Hesperian maids, whose island garden lay at earth’s furthest\r\nbounds, near where the mysterious Atlas, their father or their uncle,\r\nwise in the secrets of the sea, watched over the pillars which propped\r\nthe sky, or himself bore the burden of the heavenly vault. The poets\r\ndelighted to depict these isles with their shrill-singing nymphs, in\r\nthe same glowing words which they applied to the Isles of the Blessed.\r\n“Oh that I, like a bird, might fly from care over the Adriatic waves!”\r\ncries the chorus in the Crowned Hippolytus,\r\n\r\n“Or to the famed Hesperian plains, Whose rich trees bloom with gold, To\r\njoin the grief-attuned strains My winged progress hold: Beyond whose\r\nshores no passage gave The ruler of the purple wave;\r\n\r\n  “But Atlas stands, his stately height\r\n  The awfull boundary of the skies:\r\n  There fountains of Ambrosia rise,\r\n  Wat’ring the seat of Jove: her stores\r\n  Luxuriant there the rich soil pours\r\n  All, which the sense of gods delights.”[296]\r\n\r\nWhen these names first became attached to some of the Atlantic islands\r\nis uncertain. Diodorus Siculus does not apply either term to the island\r\ndiscovered by the Carthaginians, and described by him in phrases\r\napplicable to both. The two islands described by sailors to Sertorius\r\nabout 80 B.C. were depicted in colors which reminded Plutarch of the\r\nIsles of the Blessed, and it is certain that toward the close of the\r\nrepublic the name _Insulae Fortunatae_ was given to certain of the\r\nAtlantic islands, including the Canaries. In the time of Juba, king of\r\nNumidia, we seem to distinguish at least three groups, the _Insulae\r\nFortunatae_, the _Purpurariae_, and the _Hesperides_, but beyond\r\nthe fact that the first name still designated some of the Canaries\r\nidentification is uncertain; some have thought that different groups\r\namong the Canaries were known by separate names, while others hold that\r\none or both of the Madeira and Cape de Verde groups were known.[297]\r\nThe Canaries were soon lost out of knowledge again, but the Happy\r\nor Fortunate Islands continued to be an enticing mirage throughout\r\nthe Middle Ages, and play a part in many legends, as in that of St.\r\nBrandan, and in many poems.[298]\r\n\r\nBeside these ancient, widespread, popular myths, embodying the\r\nuniversal longing for a happier life, we find a group of stories of\r\nmore recent date, of known authorship and well-marked literary origin,\r\nwhich treat of western islands and a western continent. The group\r\ncomprises, it is hardly necessary to say, the tale of Atlantis, related\r\nby Plato; the fable of the land of the Meropes, by Theopompus; and the\r\ndescription of the Saturnian continent attributed to Plutarch.\r\n\r\nThe story of Atlantis, by its own interest and the skill of its\r\nauthor, has made by far the deepest impression. Plato, having given\r\nin the _Republic_ a picture of the ideal political organization, the\r\nstate, sketched in the _Timaeus_ the history of creation, and the\r\norigin and development of mankind; in the _Critias_ he apparently\r\nintended to exhibit the action of two types of political bodies\r\ninvolved in a life-and-death contest. The latter dialogue was\r\nunfinished, but its purport had been sketched in the opening of the\r\n_Timaeus_. Critias there relates “a strange tale, but certainly true,\r\nas Solon declared,” which had come down in his family from his ancestor\r\nDropidas, a near relative of Solon. When Solon was in Egypt he fell\r\ninto talk with an aged priest of Saïs, who said to him: “Solon, Solon,\r\nyou Greeks are all children,—there is not an old man in Greece. You\r\nhave no old traditions, and know of but one deluge, whereas there have\r\nbeen many destructions of mankind, both by flood and fire; Egypt alone\r\nhas escaped them, and in Egypt alone is ancient history recorded;\r\nyou are ignorant of your own past.” For long before Deucalion, nine\r\nthousand years ago, there was an Athens founded, like Saïs, by Athena;\r\na city rich in power and wisdom, famed for mighty deeds, the greatest\r\nof which was this. At that time there lay opposite the columns of\r\nHercules, in the Atlantic, which was then navigable, an island larger\r\nthan Libya and Asia together, from which sailors could pass to other\r\nislands, and so to the continent. The sea in front of the straits is\r\nindeed but a small harbor; that which lay beyond the island, however,\r\nis worthy of the name, and the land which surrounds that greater sea\r\nmay be truly called the continent. In this island of Atlantis had grown\r\nup a mighty power, whose kings were descended from Poseidon, and had\r\nextended their sway over many islands and over a portion of the great\r\ncontinent; even Libya up to the gates of Egypt, and Europe as far as\r\nTyrrhenia, submitted to their sway. Ever harder they pressed upon the\r\nother nations of the known world, seeking the subjugation of the whole.\r\n“Then, O Solon, did the strength of your republic become clear to all\r\nmen, by reason of her courage and force. Foremost in the arts of war,\r\nshe met the invader at the head of Greece; abandoned by her allies,\r\nshe triumphed alone over the western foe, delivering from the yoke all\r\nthe nations within the columns. But afterwards came a day and night of\r\ngreat floods and earthquakes; the earth engulfed all the Athenians who\r\nwere capable of bearing arms, and Atlantis disappeared, swallowed by\r\nthe waves: hence it is that this sea is no longer navigable, from the\r\nvast mud-shoals formed by the vanished island.” This tale so impressed\r\nSolon that he meditated an epic on the subject, but on his return,\r\nstress of public business prevented his design. In the _Critias_ the\r\nempire and chief city of Atlantis is described with wealth of detail,\r\nand the descent of the royal family from Atlas, son of Poseidon, and\r\na nymph of the island, is set forth. In the midst of a council upon\r\nOlympus, where Zeus, in true epic style, was revealing to the gods his\r\ndesigns concerning the approaching war, the dialogue breaks off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRACES OF ATLANTIS.\r\n\r\nSection of a map given in _Briefe über Amerika aus dem Italienischen\r\ndes Hn.

The\r\nareas of greatest depth (over 3,500 fathoms) are marked with crosses.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the tale of Atlantis. Read in Plato, the nature and meaning of\r\nthe narrative seem clear, but the commentators, ancient and modern,\r\nhave made wild work. The voyage of Odysseus has grown marvellously in\r\nextent since he abandoned the sea; Io has found the pens of the learned\r\nmore potent goads than Hera’s gadfly; but the travels of Atlantis have\r\nbeen even more extraordinary. No region has been so remote, no land\r\nso opposed by location, extent, or history to the words of Plato, but\r\nthat some acute investigator has found in it the origin of the lost\r\nisland. It has been identified with Africa, with Spitzbergen, with\r\nPalestine. The learned Latreille convinced himself that Persia best\r\nfulfilled the conditions of the problem; the more than learned Rudbeck\r\nardently supported the claims of Sweden through three folios. In such\r\na search America could not be overlooked. Gomara, Guillaume de Postel,\r\nWytfliet, are among those who have believed that this continent was\r\nAtlantis; Sanson in 1669, and Vaugondy in 1762, ventured to issue a\r\nmap, upon which the division of that island among the sons of Neptune\r\nwas applied to America, and the outskirts of the lost continent were\r\nextended even to New Zealand. Such work, of course, needs no serious\r\nconsideration. Plato is our authority, and Plato declares that Atlantis\r\nlay not far west from Spain, and that it disappeared some 8,000 years\r\nbefore his day. An inquiry into the truth or meaning of the record as\r\nit stands is quite justifiable, and has been several times undertaken,\r\nwith divergent results. Some, notably Paul Gaffarel[299] and Ignatius\r\nDonnelly,[300] are convinced that Plato merely adapted to his purposes\r\na story which Solon had actually brought from Egypt, and which was in\r\nall essentials true. Corroboration of the existence of such an island\r\nin the Atlantic is found, according to these writers, in the physical\r\nconformation of the Atlantic basin, and in marked resemblances between\r\nthe flora, fauna, civilization, and language of the old and new worlds,\r\nwhich demand for their explanation the prehistoric existence of just\r\nsuch a bridge as Atlantis would have supplied. The Atlantic islands are\r\nthe loftiest peaks and plateaus of the submerged island. In the widely\r\nspread deluge myths Mr. Donnelly finds strong confirmation of the final\r\ncataclysm; he places in Atlantis that primitive culture which M. Bailly\r\nsought in the highlands of Asia, and President Warren refers to the\r\nnorth pole. Space fails for a proper examination of the matter, but\r\nthese ingenious arguments remain somewhat top-heavy when all is said.\r\nThe argument from ethnological resemblances is of all arguments the\r\nweakest in the hands of advocates. It is of value only when wielded by\r\nmen of judicial temperament, who can weigh difference against likeness,\r\nand allow for the narrow range of nature’s moulds. The existence of\r\nthe ocean plateaus revealed by the soundings of the “Dolphin” and the\r\n“Challenger” proves nothing as to their having been once raised above\r\nthe waves; the most of the Atlantic islands are sharply cut off from\r\nthem. Even granting the prehistoric migration of plants and animals\r\nbetween America and Europe, as we grant it between America and Asia, it\r\ndoes not follow that it took place across the mid-ocean, and it would\r\nstill be a long step from the botanic “bridge” and elevated “ridge” to\r\nthe island empire of Plato. In short, the conservative view advocated\r\nby Longinus, that the story was designed by Plato as a literary\r\nornament and a philosophic illustration, is no less probable to-day\r\nthan when it was suggested in the schools of Alexandria. Atlantis is\r\na literary myth, belonging with _Utopia_, the _New Atlantis_, and the\r\n_Orbis alter et idem_ of Bishop Hall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the same type is a narrative which has come down indirectly, among\r\nthe flotsam and jetsam of classic literature: it is a fragment from a\r\nlost work by Theopompus of Chios, a historian of the fourth century\r\nB.C., found in the _Varia Historia_ of Aelian, a compiler of the third\r\ncentury A.D.[301] The story is told by the satyr Silenus to Midas,\r\nking of Phrygia, and is, as few commentators have refrained from\r\nremarking, worthy the ears of its auditor.[302] “Selenus tolde Midas of\r\ncertaine Islands, named Europa, Asia, and Libia, which the Ocean Sea\r\ncircumscribeth and compasseth round about. And that without this worlde\r\nthere is a continent or percell of dry lande, which in greatnesse (as\r\nhee reported) was infinite and unmeasurable, that it nourished and\r\nmaintained, by the benifite of the greene medowes and pasture plots,\r\nsundrye bigge and mighty beastes; that the men which inhabite the same\r\nclimats, exceede the stature of us twise, and yet the length of there\r\nlife is not equale to ours.” Many other wonders he related of the two\r\ncities, Machimus, the warlike, and Euseues, the city of peace, and how\r\nthe inhabitants of the former once made an attack upon Europe, and came\r\nfirst upon the Hyperboreans; but learning that they were esteemed the\r\nmost holy of the dwellers in that island, they “had them in contempte,\r\ndetesting and abhorring them as naughty people, of preposterous\r\nproperties, and damnable behauiour, and for that cause interrupted\r\ntheir progresse, supposing it an enterprise of little worthinesse or\r\nrather none at al, to trauaile into such a countrey.” The concluding\r\npassage relating to the strange country inhabited by the Meropes, from\r\nwhose name later writers have called the continent Meropian, bears only\r\nindirectly upon the subject, as characterizing the whole narrative.[303]\r\n\r\nWithout admitting the harsh judgment of Aelian, who brands Theopompus\r\nas a “coyner of lyes and a forger of fond fables,” it is clear that\r\nwe are dealing here with literature, not with history, and that the\r\nidentification of the land of the Meropes, or, as Strabo calls it,\r\nMeropis, with Atlantis or with America is arbitrary and valueless.[304]\r\n\r\nThe same remark applies to the account of the great Saturnian continent\r\nthat closes the curious and interesting dialogue “On the Face appearing\r\nin the Orb of the Moon,” attributed to Plutarch, and printed with his\r\n_Morals_:\r\n\r\n“‘An isle, Ogygia, lies in Ocean’s arms,’” says the narrator, “about\r\nfive days’ sail west from Britain; and before it are three others, of\r\nequal distance from one another, and also from that, bearing northwest,\r\nwhere the sun sets in summer. In one of these the barbarians feign\r\nthat Saturn is detained in prison by Zeus.” The adjacent sea is termed\r\nthe Saturnian, and the continent by which the great sea is circularly\r\nenvironed is distant from Ogygia about five thousand stadia, but from\r\nthe other islands not so far. A bay of this continent, in the latitude\r\nof the Caspian Sea, is inhabited by Greeks. These, who had been\r\nvisited by Heracles, and revived by his followers, esteemed themselves\r\ninhabitants of the firm land, calling all others islanders, as dwelling\r\nin land encompassed by the sea. Every thirty years these people send\r\nforth certain of their number, who minister to the imprisoned Saturn\r\nfor thirty years. One of the men thus sent forth, at the end of his\r\nservice, paid a visit to the great island, as they called Europe. From\r\nhim the narrator learned many things about the state of men after\r\ndeath, which he unfolds at length, the conclusion being that the souls\r\nof men ultimately arrive at the moon, wherein lie the Elysian Fields of\r\nHomer. “And you, O Lamprias,” he adds, “may take my relation in such\r\npart as you please.” After which hint there is, I think, but little\r\ndoubt as to the way in which it should be taken by us.[305]\r\n\r\nThat Plato, Theopompus, and Plutarch, covering a range of nearly five\r\ncenturies, should each have made use of the conception of a continent\r\nbeyond the Atlantic, is noteworthy; but it is more naturally accounted\r\nfor by supposing that all three had in mind the continental hypothesis\r\nof land distribution, than by assuming for them an acquaintance with\r\nthe great western island, America. From this point of view, the result\r\nof our search into the geographical knowledge and mythical tales of the\r\nancients is purely negative. We find, indeed, well-developed theories\r\nof physical geography, one of which accords remarkably well with the\r\ntruth; but we also find that these theories rest solely on logical\r\ndeductions from the mathematical doctrine of the sphere, and on an\r\naesthetic satisfaction with symmetry and analogy. This conclusion could\r\nbe invalidated were it shown that exploration had already revealed\r\nthe secrets of the west, and we must now consider this branch of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe history of maritime discovery begins among the Phœnicians. The\r\ncivilization of Egypt, as self-centred as that of China, accepted\r\nonly the commerce that was brought to its gates; but the men of Sidon\r\nand Tyre, with their keen devotion to material interests, their\r\nalmost modern ingenuity, had early appropriated the carrying trade\r\nof the east and the west. As they looked adventurously seaward from\r\ntheir narrow domain, the dim outline of Cyprus beckoned them down a\r\nlong lane of island stations to the rich shores of Spain. Even their\r\nreligion betrayed their bent: El and Cronos, their oldest deities,\r\nwere wanderers, and vanished in the west; on their traces Melkarth led\r\na motley swarm of colonists to the Atlantic. These legends, filtering\r\nthrough Cyprus, Crete, or Rhodes, or borne by rash adventurers from\r\ndistant Gades, appeared anew in Grecian mythology, the deeds of\r\nMelkarth mingling with the labors of Hercules. We do not know when the\r\nPhœnicians first reached the Atlantic, nor what were the limits of\r\ntheir ocean voyages. Gades, the present Cadiz, just outside the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar, was founded a few years before 1100 B.C., but not, it is\r\nprobable, without previous knowledge of the commercial importance of\r\nthe location. There were numerous other settlements along the adjacent\r\ncoast, and the gold, silver, and tin of these distant regions grew\r\nfamiliar in the markets of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India. The trade\r\nwith Tartessus, the El Dorado of antiquity, gave the Phœnician merchant\r\nvessels a name among the Jews, as well in the tenth century, when\r\nSolomon shared the adventures of Hiram, as in the sixth, when Ezekiel\r\ndepicted the glories of Tyrian commerce. The Phœnician seamanship was\r\nwide-famed; their vessels were unmatched in speed,[306] and their\r\nfurniture and discipline excited the outspoken admiration of Xenophon.\r\nBeside the large Tarshish ships, they possessed light merchant vessels\r\nand ships of war, provided with both sails and oars, and these,\r\nsomewhat akin to steamships in their independence of wind, were well\r\nadapted for exploration. Thus urged and thus provided, it is improbable\r\nthat the Phœnicians shunned the great ocean. The evidence is still\r\nstrong in favor of their direct trade with Britain for tin, despite\r\nwhat has been urged as to tin mines in Spain and the prehistoric\r\nexistence of the trade by land across Gaul.[307]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhether the Tyrians discovered any of the Atlantic islands is unknown;\r\nthe adventures and discoveries attributed to Hercules, who in this\r\naspect is but Melkarth in Grecian raiment, points toward an early\r\nknowledge of western islands, but these myths alone are not conclusive\r\nproof. Diodorus Siculus attributes to the Phœnicians the discovery, by\r\naccident, of a large island, with navigable rivers and a delightful\r\nclimate, many days’ sail westward from Africa. In the compilation _De\r\nMirabilibus Auscultationibus_, printed with the works of Aristotle,\r\nthe discovery is attributed to Carthaginians. Both versions descend\r\nfrom one original, now lost, and it is impossible to give a date to the\r\nevent, or to identify the locality.[308] Those who find America in the\r\nisland of Diodorus make improbabilities supply the lack of evidence.\r\nStories seldom lose in the telling, and while it is not impossible that\r\na Phœnician ship might have reached America, and even made her way\r\nback, it is not likely that the voyage would have been tamely described\r\nas of many _days’_ duration.\r\n\r\nWhen Carthage succeeded Tyre as mistress of the Mediterranean commerce,\r\ninterest in the West revived. In the middle of the fifth century B.C.,\r\ntwo expeditions of importance were dispatched into these waters. A\r\nlarge fleet under Hanno sailed to colonize, or re-colonize, the western\r\ncoast of Africa, and succeeded in reaching the latitude of Sierra\r\nLeone. Himilko, voyaging in the opposite direction, spent several\r\nmonths in exploring the ocean and tracing the western shores of Europe.\r\nHe appears to have run into the Sargasso Sea, but beyond this little is\r\nknown of his adventures.[309]\r\n\r\nUltimately the Carthaginians discovered and colonized the Canary\r\nIslands, and perhaps the Madeira and Cape Verde groups; the evidence\r\nof ethnology, the presence of Semitic inscriptions, and the occurrence\r\nin the descriptions of Pliny, Mela, and Ptolemy of some of the modern\r\nnames of the separate islands, establishes this beyond a doubt for\r\nthe Canaries.[310] There is no evidence that the Phœnicians or\r\nCarthaginians penetrated much beyond the coast islands, or that they\r\nreached any part of America, or even the Azores.\r\n\r\nThe achievements of the Greeks and Romans were still more limited. A\r\ncertain Colaeus visited Gades towards the middle of the seventh century\r\nB.C., and was, according to Herodotus, the first Greek who passed\r\noutside of the columns of Hercules. His example could not have been\r\nwidely followed, for we find Pindar and his successors referring to the\r\nPillars as the limit of navigation. In 600 B.C., Massilia was founded,\r\nand soon became a rival of Carthage in the western Mediterranean. In\r\nthe fourth century we have evidence of an attempt to search out the\r\nsecrets of the ocean after the manner of Hanno and Himilko. In that\r\ncentury, Pytheas made his famous voyage to the lands of tin and amber,\r\ndiscovering the still mysterious Thule; while at the same time his\r\ncountryman Euthymenes sailed southward to the Senegal. With these\r\nexceptions we hear of no Grecian or Roman explorations in the Atlantic,\r\nand meet with no indication that they were aware of any other lands\r\nbeyond the sea than the Fortunate Isles or the Hesperides of the early\r\npoets.[311]\r\n\r\nAbout 80 B.C., Sertorius, being for a time driven from Spain by the\r\nforces of Sulla, fell in, when on an expedition to Baetica, with\r\ncertain sailors who had just returned from the “Atlantic islands,”\r\nwhich they described as two in number, distant 10,000 stadia from\r\nAfrica, and enjoying a wonderful climate. The account in Plutarch is\r\nquite consistent with a previous knowledge of the islands, even on\r\nthe part of Sertorius. Be this as it may, the glowing praises of the\r\neye-witnesses so impressed him that only the unwillingness of his\r\nfollowers prevented his taking refuge there. Within the next few years,\r\nthe Canaries, at least, became well known as the _Fortunatae Insulae_;\r\nbut when Horace, in the dark days of civil war, urged his countrymen\r\nto seek a new home across the waves, it was apparently the islands\r\nof Sertorius that he had in mind, regarding them as unknown to other\r\npeoples.[312]\r\n\r\nAs we trace the increasing volume and extent of commerce from the days\r\nof Tyre and Carthage and Alexandria to its fullest development under\r\nthe empire, and remember that as the drafts of luxury-loving Rome upon\r\nthe products of the east, even of China and farther India, increased,\r\nthe true knowledge of the form of the earth, and the underestimate\r\nof the breadth of the western ocean, became more widely known, the\r\nquestion inevitably suggests itself, Why did not the enterprise which\r\nhad long since utilized the monsoons of the Indian Ocean for direct\r\npassage to and from India essay the passage of the Atlantic? The\r\ninquiry gains force as we recall that the possibility of such a route\r\nto India had been long ago asserted. Aristotle suggested, if he did not\r\nexpress it; Eratosthenes stated plainly that were it not for the extent\r\nof the Atlantic it would be possible to sail from Spain to India along\r\nthe same parallel;[313] and Strabo could object nothing but the chance\r\nof there being another island-continent or two in the way,—an objection\r\nunknown to Columbus. Seneca, the philosopher, iterating insistence upon\r\nthe smallness of the earth and the pettiness of its affairs compared\r\nwith the higher interests of the soul, exclaims: “The earth, which you\r\nso anxiously divide by fire and sword into kingdoms, is a point, a\r\nmere point, in the universe.... How far is it from the utmost shores\r\nof Spain to those of India? But very few days’ sail with a favoring\r\nwind.”[314]\r\n\r\nHolding these views of the possibility of the voyage, it is improbable\r\nthat the size of their ships and the lack of the compass could have\r\nlong prevented the ancients from putting them in practice had their\r\ninterest so demanded.[315] Their interest in the matter was, however,\r\npurely speculative, since, under the unity and power of the Roman\r\nempire, which succeeded to and absorbed the commercial supremacy of the\r\nPhœnicians, international competition in trade did not exist, nor were\r\nthe routes of trade subject to effective hostile interruption. The two\r\ncauses, therefore, which worked powerfully to induce the voyages of Da\r\nGama and Columbus, after the rise of individual states had given scope\r\nto national jealousy and pride, and after the fall of Constantinople\r\nhad placed the last natural gateway of the eastern trade in the hands\r\nof Arab infidels, were non-existent under the older civilization. It\r\nis certain, too, that the ancients had a vivid horror of the western\r\nocean. In the Odyssey, the western Mediterranean even is full of peril.\r\nWith knowledge of the ocean, the Greeks received tales of “Gorgons\r\nand Chimeras dire,” and the very poets who sing the beauties of the\r\nElysian or Hesperian isles dwell on the danger of the surrounding sea.\r\nBeyond Gades, declared Pindar, no man, however brave, could pass;\r\nonly a god might voyage those waters. The same idea recurs in the\r\nreports of travellers and the writings of men of science, but here it\r\nis the storms, or more often the lack of wind, the viscid water or\r\nvast shoals, that check and appall the mariner. Aristotle thought that\r\nbeyond the columns the sea was shallow and becalmed. Plato utilized\r\nthe common idea of the mudbanks and shoal water of the Atlantic in\r\naccounting for the disappearance of Atlantis. Scylax reported the ocean\r\nnot navigable beyond Cerne in the south, and Pytheas heard that beyond\r\nThule sea and air became confounded. Even Tacitus believed that there\r\nwas a peculiar resistance in the waters of the northern ocean.[316]\r\n\r\nWhether the Greeks owed this dread to the Phœnicians, and whether\r\nthe latter shared the feeling, or simulated and encouraged it for the\r\npurpose of concealing their profitable adventures beyond the Straits,\r\nis doubtful. In two cases, at least, it is possible to trace statements\r\nof this nature to Punic sources, and antiquity agreed in giving the\r\nPhœnicians credit for discouraging rivalry by every art.[317]\r\n\r\nTo an age averse to investigation for its own sake, ignorant of\r\nscientific curiosity, and unimpelled by economic pressure, tales like\r\nthese might seem decisive against an attempt to sail westward to India.\r\nRome could thoroughly appreciate the imaginative mingling of science\r\nand legend which vivified the famous prophecy of the poet Seneca:\r\n\r\n  Venient annis saecula seris\r\n  Quibus Oceanus vincula rerum\r\n  Laxet, et ingens patebit tellus\r\n  Tethysque novos deteget orbes\r\n  Nec sit terris ultima Thule.[318]\r\n\r\nBut even were it overlooked that the prophecy suited better the\r\nrevelation of an unknown continent, such as the theory of Crates and\r\nCicero placed between Europe and Asia, than the discovery of the\r\neastern coast of India, mariners and merchants might be pardoned if\r\nthey set the deterrent opinions collected by the elder Seneca above the\r\nlivelier fancies of his son.[319]\r\n\r\nThe scanty records of navigation and discovery in the western waters\r\nconfirm the conclusions drawn from the visions of the poets and the\r\ntheories of the philosophers. No evidence from the classic writers\r\njustifies the assumption that the ancients communicated with America.\r\nIf they guessed at the possibility of such a continent, it was only as\r\nwe to-day imagine an antarctic continent or an open polar sea. Evidence\r\nfrom ethnological comparisons is of course admissible, but those who\r\nare best fitted to handle such evidence best know its dangers; hitherto\r\nits use has brought little but discredit to the cause in which it was\r\ninvoked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe geographical doctrines which antiquity bequeathed to the\r\nMiddle Ages were briefly these: that the earth was a sphere with a\r\ncircumference of 252,000 or 180,000 stadia; that only the temperate\r\nzones were inhabitable, and the northern alone known to be inhabited;\r\nthat of the southern, owing to the impassable heats of the torrid zone,\r\nit could not be discovered whether it were inhabited, or whether,\r\nindeed, land existed there; and that of the northern, it was unknown\r\nwhether the intervention of another continent, or only the shoals and\r\nunknown horrors of the ocean, prevented a westward passage from Europe\r\nto Asia. The legatee preserved, but did not improve his inheritance.\r\nIt has been supposed that the early Middle Ages, under the influence\r\nof barbarism and Christianity, ignored the sphericity of the earth,\r\ndeliberately returning to the assumption of a plane surface, either\r\nwheel-shaped or rectangular. That knowledge dwindled after the fall\r\nof the empire, that the early church included the learning as well\r\nas the religion of the pagans in its ban, is undeniable; but on this\r\npoint truth prevailed. It was preserved by many school-books, in many\r\npopular compilations from classic authors, and was accepted by many\r\necclesiastics. St. Augustine did not deny the sphericity of the earth.\r\nIt was assumed by Isidor of Seville, and taught by Bede.[320] The\r\nschoolmen buttressed the doctrine by the authority of Aristotle and the\r\nliving science which the Arabs built upon the Almagest. Gerbert, Albert\r\nthe Great, Roger Bacon, Dante, were as familiar with the idea of the\r\nearth-globe as were Hipparchus and Ptolemy. The knowledge of it came to\r\nColumbus not as an inspiration or an invention, but by long, unbroken\r\ndescent from its unknown Grecian, or pre-Grecian, discoverer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RECTANGULAR EARTH.\r\n\r\nSketched in the _Bollettino della Società geografica italiana_ (Roma,\r\n1882), p. 540, from the original in the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana\r\nin Florence. The representation of this sketch of the earth by Cosmas\r\nIndicopleustes more commonly met with is from the engraving in the\r\nedition of Cosmas in Montfaucon’s _Collectio nova patrum_, Paris, 1706.\r\nThe article by Marinelli which contains the sketch given here has also\r\nappeared separately in a German translation (_Die Erdkunde bei den\r\nKirchenvätern_, Leipzig, 1884). The continental land beyond the ocean\r\nshould be noticed.]\r\n\r\nAs to the distribution of land and water, the oceanic theory of\r\nCrates, as expounded by Macrobius, prevailed in the west, although the\r\nexistence of antipodes fell a victim to the union, in the ecclesiastic\r\nmind, of the heathen theory of an impassable torrid zone with the\r\nChristian teaching of the descent of all men from Adam.[321] The\r\ndiscoveries made by the ancients in the ocean, of the Canaries and\r\nother islands known to them, were speedily forgotten, while their\r\ngeographic myths were superseded by a ranker growth. The Saturnian\r\ncontinent, Meropis, Atlantis, the Fortunate Isles, the Hesperides, were\r\nrelegated to the dusty realm of classical learning; but the Atlantic\r\nwas not barren of their like. Mediæval maps swarmed with fabulous\r\nislands, and wild stories of adventurous voyages divided the attention\r\nwith tales of love and war. Antillia was the largest, and perhaps the\r\nmost famous, of these islands; it was situated in longitude 330° east,\r\nand near the latitude of Lisbon, so that Toscanelli regarded it as much\r\nfacilitating the plan of Columbus. Well known, too, was Braçir, or\r\nBrazil, having its proper position west and north of Ireland, but often\r\nmet with elsewhere; both this island and Antillia afterward gave names\r\nto portions of the new continent.[322]\r\n\r\nAntillia, otherwise called the Island of Seven Cities, was discovered\r\nand settled by an archbishop and six bishops of Spain, who fled into\r\nthe ocean after the victory of the Moors, in 714, over Roderick; it is\r\neven reported to have been rediscovered in 1447.[323] Mayda, Danmar,\r\nMan Satanaxio, Isla Verde, and others of these islands, of which but\r\nlittle is known beside the names, appear for the first time upon the\r\nmaps of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but their origin is\r\nquite unknown. It might be thought that they were derived from confused\r\ntraditions of their classical predecessors, with which they have been\r\nidentified, but modern folk-lore has shown that such fancies spring\r\nup spontaneously in every community. To dream of a distant spot where\r\njoy is untroubled and rest unbroken by grief or toil is a natural and\r\ninalienable bent of the human mind. Those happy islands which abound in\r\nthe romances of the heathen Celts, Mag Mell, Field of Delight, Flath\r\nInis, Isle of the Heroes, the Avallon of the Arthur cycle, were but a\r\nmore exuberant forth-putting of the same soil that produced the Elysian\r\nFields of Homer or the terrestrial paradise of the Hebrews. The later\r\ngrowth is not born of the seed of the earlier, though somewhat affected\r\nby alien grafts, as in the case of the famous island of St. Brandan,\r\nwhere there is a curious commingling of Celtic, Greek, and Christian\r\ntraditions. It is dangerous, indeed, to speak of earlier or later in\r\nreference to such myths; one group was written before the others, but\r\nit is quite possible that the earthly paradise of the Celt is as old as\r\nthose of the Mediterranean peoples. The idea of a phantom or vanishing\r\nisland, too, is very old,—as old, doubtless, as the fact of fog-banks\r\nand mirage,—and it is well exemplified in those mysterious visions\r\nwhich enticed the sailors of Bristol to many a fruitless quest before\r\nthe discovery of America, and for centuries tantalized the inhabitants\r\nof the Canaries with hope of discovery. The Atlantic islands were\r\nnot all isles of the blessed; there were many Isles of Demons, such\r\nas Ramusio places north of Newfoundland, a name of evil report which\r\nafterward attached itself with more reason to Sable Island and even to\r\nthe Bermudas:\r\n\r\n“Kept, as suppos’d by Hel’s infernal dogs; Our fleet found there most\r\nhonest courteous hogs.”[324]\r\n\r\nNot until the revival of classical learning did the continental system\r\nof Ptolemy reach the west; the way, however, had been prepared for it.\r\nThe measurement of a degree, executed under the Calif Mamun, seemed\r\nto the Europeans to confirm the smallest estimate of the size of the\r\nearth, which Ptolemy also had adopted,[325] while the travels of Marco\r\nPolo, revealing the great island of Japan, exaggerated the popular idea\r\nof the extent of the known world, until the 225° of Marinus seemed\r\nmore probable than the 180° of Ptolemy. If, however, time brought this\r\nshrinkage in the breadth of the Atlantic, the temptation to navigators\r\nwas opposed by the belief in the dangers of the ocean, which shared\r\nthe persistent life of the dogma of the impassable torrid zone, and\r\nwas strongly reinforced by Arab lore. Their geographers never tire\r\nof dilating on the calms and storms, mudbanks and fogs, and unknown\r\ndangers of the “Sea of Darkness.” Nevertheless, as the turmoil of\r\nmediæval life made gentler spirits sigh for peace in distant homes,\r\nwhile the wild energy of others found the very dangers of the sea\r\ndelightful, there was opened a double source of adventures, both real\r\nand imaginary. Those pillars cut with inscriptions forbidding further\r\nadvance westward, which we owe to Moorish fancy, confounding Hercules\r\nand Atlas and Alexander, were transformed into a knightly hero pointing\r\noceanwards, or became guide-posts to the earthly paradise.\r\n\r\nIf there be a legendary flavor in the flight of the seven bishops, we\r\nmust set down the wanderings of the Magrurin[326] among the African\r\nislands, the futile but bold attempts of the Visconti to circumnavigate\r\nAfrica, as real, though without the least footing in a list of\r\nclaimants for the discovery of America. The voyages of St. Brandan\r\nand St. Malo, again, are distinctly fabulous, and but other forms of\r\nthe ancient myth of the soul-voyages; and the same may be said of the\r\nstrange tale of Maelduin.[327] But what of those other Irish voyages\r\nto Irland-it-mikla and Huitramannaland, of the voyage of Madoc, of the\r\nexplorations of the Zeni? While these tales merit close investigation,\r\nit is certain that whatever liftings of the veil there may have\r\nbeen—that there were any is extremely doubtful—were unheralded at the\r\ntime and soon forgotten.[328]\r\n\r\nIt was reserved for the demands of commerce to reveal the secrets of\r\nthe west. But when the veil was finally removed it was easy for men to\r\nsee that it had never been quite opaque. The learned turned naturally\r\nto their new-found classics, and were not slow to find the passages\r\nwhich seemed prophetic of America. Seneca, Virgil, Horace, Aristotle,\r\nand Theopompus, were soon pressed into the service, and the story of\r\nAtlantis obtained at once a new importance. I have tried to show in\r\nthis chapter that these patrons of a revived learning put upon these\r\nstatements an interpretation which they will not bear.\r\n\r\nThe summing up of the whole matter cannot be better given than in\r\nthe words applied by a careful Grecian historian to another question\r\nin ancient geography: “In some future time perhaps our pains may\r\nlead us to a knowledge of those countries. But all that has hitherto\r\nbeen written or reported of them must be considered as mere fable\r\nand invention, and not the fruit of any real search, or genuine\r\ninformation.”[329]\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.\r\n\r\nTHE views of the ancient Mediterranean peoples upon geography are\r\npreserved almost solely in the ancient classics. The poems attributed\r\nto Homer and Hesiod, the so-called Orphic hymns, the odes of Pindar,\r\neven the dramatic works of Æschylus and his successors, are sources for\r\nthe earlier time. The writings of the earlier philosophers are lost,\r\nand their ideas are to be found in later writers, and in compilations\r\nlike the Biographies of Diogenes Laertius (3d cent. A.D.), the _De\r\nplacitis philosophorum_ attributed to Plutarch, and the like. Among\r\nthe works of Plato the _Phaedo_ and _Timaeus_ and the last book of the\r\n_Republic_ bear on the form and arrangement of the earth; the Timaeus\r\nand _Critias_ contain the fable of Atlantis. The first scientific\r\ntreatises preserved are the _De Caelo_ and _Meteorologica_ of\r\nAristotle.[330] It is needless to speak in detail of the geographical\r\nwriters, accounts of whom will be found in any history of Greek and\r\nRoman literature. The minor pieces, such as the _Periplus_ of Hanno,\r\nof Scylax of Caryanda, of Dionysius Periegetes, the Geography of\r\nAgatharcides, and others, have been several times collected;[331] and\r\nso have the minor historians, which may be consulted for Theopompus,\r\nHecataeus, and the mythologists.[332] The geographical works of\r\nPytheas (B.C. 350?), of Eratosthenes (B.C. 276-126), of Polybius (B.C.\r\n204-122), of Hipparchus (flor. circ. B.C. 125), of Posidonius (1st\r\ncent. B.C.), are preserved only in quotations made by later writers;\r\nthey have, however, been collected and edited in convenient form.[333]\r\nThe most important source of our knowledge of Greek geography and\r\nGreek geographers is of course the great _Geography_ of Strabo, which\r\na happy fortune preserved to us. The long introduction upon the nature\r\nof geography and the size of the earth and the dimensions of the known\r\nworld is of especial interest, both for his own views and for those he\r\ncriticises.[334] Strabo lived about B.C. 60 to A.D. 24.\r\n\r\nThe works of Marinus of Tyre having perished, the next important\r\ngeographical work in Greek is the world-renowned _Geography_ of\r\nPtolemaeus, who wrote in the second half of the second century A.D.\r\nDespite the peculiar merits and history of this work, it is not so\r\nimportant for our purpose as the work of Strabo, though it exercised\r\ninfinitely more influence on the Middle Ages and on early modern\r\ngeography.[335]\r\n\r\nThe astronomical writers are also of importance. Eudoxus of Cnidus,\r\nsaid to have first adduced the change in the altitude of stars\r\naccompanying a change of latitude as proof of the sphericity of\r\nthe earth, wrote works now known only in the poems of Aratus, who\r\nflourished in the latter half of the third century B.C.[336] Geminus\r\n(circ. B.C. 50),[337] and Cleomedes,[338] whose work is famous for\r\nhaving preserved the method by which Eratosthenes measured the\r\ncircumference of the earth, were authors of brief popular compilations\r\nof astronomical science. Of vast importance in the history of\r\nlearning was the astronomical work of Ptolemy, _ἡ μεγάλη σύνταξις τῆς\r\nἀστρονομίας_, which was so honored by the Arabs that it is best known\r\nto us as the _Almagest_, from _Tabric al Magisthri_, the title of\r\nthe Arabic translation which was made in 827. It has been edited and\r\ntranslated by Halma (Paris, 1813, 1816).\r\n\r\nMuch is to be learned from the _Scholia_ attached in early times to the\r\nworks of Hesiod, Homer, Pindar, the _Argonautica_ of Apollonius Rhodius\r\n(B.C. 276-193?), and to the works of Aristotle, Plato, etc. In some\r\ncases these are printed with the works commented upon; in other cases,\r\nthe _Scholia_ have been printed separately. The commentary of Proclus\r\n(A.D. 412-485) upon the _Timaeus_ of Plato is of great importance in\r\nthe Atlantis myth.[339]\r\n\r\nMuch interest attaches to the dialogue entitled _On the face appearing\r\nin the orb of the moon_, which appears among the _Moralia_ of Plutarch.\r\nReally a contribution to the question of life after death, this work\r\nalso throws light upon geographical and astronomical knowledge of its\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans we find much the same succession of sources. The\r\npoets, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Tibullus, Lucretius, Lucan, Seneca, touch\r\non geographical or astronomical points and reflect the opinion of their\r\nday.[340]\r\n\r\nThe first six books of the great encyclopaedia compiled by Pliny\r\nthe elder (A.D. 23-79)[341] contain an account of the universe and\r\nthe earth, which is of the greatest value, and was long exploited by\r\ncompilers of later times, among the earliest and best of whom was\r\nSolinus.[342] Equally famous with Solinus was the author of a work of\r\nmore independent character, Pomponius Mela, who lived in the first\r\ncentury A.D. His geography, commonly known as _De situ orbis_ from\r\nthe mediæval title, though the proper name is _De chorographia_, is\r\na work of importance and merit. In the Middle Ages it had wonderful\r\npopularity.[343] Cicero, who contemplated writing a history of\r\ngeography, touches upon the arrangement of the earth’s surface several\r\ntimes in his works, as in the _Tusculan Disputations_, and notably in\r\nthe sixth book of the _Republic_, in the episode known as the “Dream\r\nof Scipio.” The importance of this piece is enhanced by the commentary\r\nupon it written by Macrobius in the fifth century A.D.[344] A peculiar\r\ninterest attaches to the poems of Avienus, of the fourth century A.D.,\r\nin that they give much information about the character attributed to\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean.[345] The astronomical poems of Manilius[346] and\r\nHyginus were favorites in early Middle Ages. The astrological character\r\nof the work of Manilius made it popular, but it conveyed also the\r\ntrue doctrine of the form of the earth. The curious work of Marcianus\r\nCapella gave a résumé of science in the first half of the fifth century\r\nA.D., and had a like popularity as a school-book and house-book which\r\nalso helped maintain the truth.[347]\r\n\r\nSuch in the main are the ancient writers upon which we must chiefly\r\nrely in considering the present question. In the interpretation of\r\nthese sources much has been done by the leading modern writers on\r\nthe condition of science in ancient times; like Bunbury, Ukert,\r\nForbiger, St. Martin, and Peschel on geography;[348] like Zeller on\r\nphilosophy, not to name many others;[349] and like Lewis and Martin\r\non astronomy;[350] but there is no occasion to go to much length in\r\nthe enumeration of this class of books. The reader is referred to the\r\nexamination of the literature of special points of the geographical\r\nstudies of the ancients to the notes following this Essay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMediæval cosmology and geography await a thorough student; they are\r\nimbedded in the wastes of theological discussions of the Fathers, or\r\nhidden in manuscript cosmographies in libraries of Europe. It should\r\nbe noted that confusion has arisen from the use of the word _rotundus_\r\nto express both the sphericity of the earth and the circularity of the\r\nknown lands, and from the use of _terra_, or _orbis terrae_, to denote\r\nthe inhabited lands, as well as the globe. It has been pointed out by\r\nRuge (_Gesch. d. Zeitalters der Entdeckungen_, p. 97) that the later\r\nMiddle Age adopted the circular form of the _oekoumene_ in consequence\r\nof a peculiar theory as to the relation of the land and water masses\r\nof the earth, which were conceived as two intercepting spheres. The\r\n_oekoumene_ might easily be spoken of as a round disk without implying\r\nthat the whole earth was plane.[351] That the struggle of the Christian\r\nfaith, at first for existence and then for the proper harvesting of the\r\nfruits of victory, induced its earlier defenders to wage war against\r\nthe learning as well as the religion of the pagans; that Christians\r\nwere inclined to think time taken from the contemplation of the true\r\nfaith worse than wasted when given to investigations into natural\r\nphenomena, which might better be accepted for what they professed to\r\nbe; and that they often found in Scripture a welcome support for the\r\nevidence of the senses,—cannot be denied. It was inevitable that St.\r\nChrysostom, Lactantius, Orosius and Origines rejected or declined\r\nto teach the sphericity of the earth. The curious systems of Cosmas\r\nand Aethicus, marked by a return to the crudest conceptions of the\r\nuniverse, found some favor in Europe. But the truth was not forgotten.\r\nThe astronomical poems of Aratus, Hyginus, and Manilius were still\r\nread. Solinus and other plunderers of Pliny were popular, and kept\r\nalive the ancient knowledge. The sphericity of the earth was not denied\r\nby St. Augustine; it was maintained by Martianus Capella, and assumed\r\nby Isidor of Seville. Bede[352] taught the whole system of ancient\r\ngeography; and but little later, Virgilius, bishop of Saltzburg, was\r\nthreatened with papal displeasure, not for teaching the sphericity\r\nof the earth, but for upholding the existence of antipodes.[353]\r\nThe canons of Ptolemy were cited in the eleventh century by Hermann\r\nContractus in his _De utilitatibus astrolabii_, and in the twelfth by\r\nHugues de Saint Victor in his _Eruditio didascalica_. Strabo was not\r\nknown before Pope Nicholas V., who ordered the first translation. Not\r\nmany to-day can illustrate the truth more clearly than the author of\r\n_L’Image du Monde_, an anonymous poem of the thirteenth century. If two\r\nmen, he says, were to start at the same time from a given point and go,\r\nthe one east, the other west,—\r\n\r\n  Si que andui egaumont alassent\r\n  Il convendroit qu’il s’encontrassent\r\n  Dessus le leu dont il se mûrent.[354]\r\n\r\nIn general, the mathematical and astronomical treatises were earlier\r\nknown to the West than the purely metaphysical works: this was the case\r\nin the eleventh and twelfth centuries; in the thirteenth the schoolmen\r\nwere familiar with the whole body of Aristotle’s works. Thus the\r\ninfluence of Aristotle on natural science was early important, either\r\nthrough Arabian commentators or paraphrasers, or through translations\r\nmade from the Arabic, or directly from the Greek.[355]\r\n\r\nJourdain affirms that it was the influence of Aristotle and his\r\ninterpreters that kept alive in the Middle Ages the doctrine that India\r\nand Spain were not far apart. He also maintains that the doctrine of\r\nthe sphericity of the earth was familiar throughout the Middle Age,\r\nand, if anything, more of a favorite than the other view.\r\n\r\nThe field of the later ecclesiastical and scholastic writers, who kept\r\nup the contentions over the form of the earth and kindred subjects,\r\nis too large to be here minutely surveyed. Such of them as were well\r\nknown to the geographical students of the centuries next preceding\r\nColumbus have been briefly indicated in another place;[356] and if\r\nnot completely, yet with helpful outlining, the whole subject of the\r\nmediæval cosmology has been studied by not a few of the geographical\r\nand cartographical students of later days.[357] So far as these studies\r\npertain to the theory of a Lost Atlantis and the fabulous islands of\r\nthe Atlantic Ocean, they will be particularly illustrated in the notes\r\nwhich follow this Essay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wm. H. Tillinghast]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n=A.= THE FORM OF THE EARTH.—It is not easy to demonstrate that the\r\nearliest Greeks believed the earth to be a flat disk, although that is\r\nthe accepted and probably correct view of their belief. It is possible\r\nto examine but a small part of the earliest literature, and what we\r\nhave is of uncertain date and dubious origin; its intent is religious\r\nor romantic, not scientific; its form is poetic. It is difficult to\r\ninterpret it accurately, since the prevalent ideas of nature must be\r\ndeduced from imagery, qualifying words and phrases, and seldom from\r\ndirect description. The interpreter, doubtful as to the proportion in\r\nwhich he finds mingled fancy and honest faith, is in constant danger\r\nof overreaching himself by excess of ingenuity. In dealing with such\r\na literature one is peculiarly liable to abuse the always dangerous\r\nargument by which want of knowledge is inferred from lack of mention.\r\nOther difficulties beset the use of later philosophic material, much\r\nof which is preserved only in extracts made by antagonists or by\r\ncompilers, so that we are forced to confront a lack of context and\r\npossible misunderstanding or misquotation. The frequent use of the\r\nword _στρογγύλος_, which has the same ambiguity as our word “round”\r\nin common parlance, often leads to uncertainty. A more fruitful cause\r\nof trouble is inherent in the Greek manner of thinking of the world.\r\nIt is often difficult to know whether a writer means the planet, or\r\nwhether he means the agglomeration of known lands which later writers\r\ncalled _ἡ οἰκουμένη_. It is not impossible that when writers refer to\r\nthe earth as encircled by the river Oceanus, they mean, not the globe,\r\nbut the known lands, the eastern continent, as we say, what the Romans\r\nsometimes called _orbis terrae or orbis terrarum_, a term which may\r\nmean the “circle of the lands,” not the “orb of the earth.” At a later\r\ntime it was a well-known belief that the earth-globe and water-globe\r\nwere excentrics, so that a segment of the former projected beyond the\r\nsurface of the latter in one part, and constituted the known world.[358]\r\n\r\nI cannot attach much importance to the line of argument with which\r\nmodern writers since Voss have tried to prove that the Homeric poems\r\nrepresent the earth flat. That Poseidon, from the mountains of the\r\nSolymi, sees Odesseus on the sea to the west of Greece (_Od._ v. 282);\r\nthat Helios could see his cattle in Thrinakia both as he went toward\r\nthe heavens and as he turned toward the earth again (_Od._ xii. 380);\r\nthat at sunset “all the ways are darkened;” that the sun and the\r\nstars set in and rose from the ocean,—these and similar proofs seem\r\nto me to have as little weight as attaches to the expressions “ends\r\nof the earth,” or to the flowing of Oceanus around the earth. There\r\nare, however, other and better reasons for assuming that the earth in\r\nearliest thought was flat. Such is the most natural assumption from the\r\nevidence of sight, and there is certainly nothing in the older writings\r\ninconsistent with such an idea. We know, moreover, that in the time of\r\nSocrates it was yet a matter of debate as to whether the earth was flat\r\nor spherical, as it was in the time of Plutarch.[359] We are distinctly\r\ntold by Aristotle that various forms were attributed to earth by\r\nearly philosophers, and the implication is that the spherical theory,\r\nwhose truth he proceeds to demonstrate, was a new thought.[360] It is\r\nvery unlikely, except to those who sincerely accept the theory of a\r\nprimitive race of unequalled wisdom, that the sphericity of the earth,\r\nhaving been known to Homer, should have been cast aside by the Ionic\r\nphilosophers and the Epicureans, and forgotten by educated people five\r\nor six centuries later, as it must have been before the midnight voyage\r\nof Helios in his golden cup, and before similar attempts to account\r\nfor the return of the sun could have become current. Ignorance of the\r\ntrue shape of the earth is also indicated by the common view that the\r\nsun appeared much larger at rising to the people of India than to the\r\nGrecians, and at setting presented the same phenomenon in Spain.[361]\r\nAs we have seen, the description of Tartarus in the Theogony of Hesiod,\r\nwhich Fick thinks an interpolation of much later date, likens the earth\r\nto a lid.\r\n\r\nThe question has always been an open one. Crates of Mallos, Strabo, and\r\nother Homer-worshippers of antiquity, could not deny to the poet any\r\nknowledge current in their day, but their reasons for assuming that he\r\nknew the earth to be a globe are not strong. In recent years President\r\nWarren has maintained that Homer’s earth was a sphere with Oceanus\r\nflowing around the equator, that the pillars of Atlas meant the axis of\r\nthe earth, and that Ogygia was at the north pole.[362] Homer, however,\r\nthought that Oceanus flowed around the known lands, not that it merely\r\ngrazed their southern border: it is met with in the east where the sun\r\nrises, in the west (_Od._ iv. 567), and in the north (_Od._ v. 275).\r\n\r\nThat “Homer and all the ancient poets conceived the earth to be\r\na plane” was distinctly asserted by Geminus in the first century\r\nB.C.,[363] and has been in general steadfastly maintained by moderns\r\nlike Voss,[364] Völcker,[365] Buchholtz,[366] Gladstone,[367]\r\nMartin,[368] Schaefer,[369] and Gruppe.[370] It is therefore\r\nintrinsically probable, commonly accepted, and not contradicted by what\r\nis known of the literature of the time itself.[371]\r\n\r\n\r\n=B.= HOMER’S GEOGRAPHY.—There is an extensive literature on the\r\ngeographic attainments of Homer, but it is for the most part rather sad\r\nreading. The later Greeks had a local identification for every place\r\nmentioned in the _Odyssey_; but conservative scholars at present are\r\nchary of such, while agreed in confining the scene of the wanderings\r\nto the western Mediterranean. Gladstone, in _Homer and the Homeric\r\nAge_, has argued with ingenuity for the transfer of the scene from\r\nthe West to the East, and has constructed on this basis one of the\r\nmost extraordinary maps of “the ancient world” known. K. E. von Baer\r\n(_Wo ist der Schauplatz d. Fahrten d. Odysseus zu finden? 1875_),\r\nagreeing with Gladstone, “identifies” the Lastrygonian harbor with\r\nBalaklava, and discovers the very poplar grove of Persephone. It is\r\na favorite scheme with others to place the wanderings outside the\r\ncolumns of Hercules, among the Atlantic isles,[372] and to include\r\na circumnavigation of Africa. The better opinion seems to me that\r\nwhich leaves the wanderings in the western Mediterranean, which\r\nwas considered to extend much farther north than it actually does.\r\nThe maps which represent the voyage within the actual coast lines\r\nof the sea, and indicate the vessel passing through the Straits to\r\nthe ocean, are misleading. There is not enough given in the poem to\r\nresolve the problem. The courses are vague, the distances uncertain or\r\nconventional,—often neither are given; and the matter is complicated\r\nby the introduction of a _floating_ island, and the mysterious voyages\r\nfrom the land of the Phaeacians. It is a pleasant device adopted by\r\nBuchholtz and others to assume that where the course is not given, the\r\nwind last mentioned must be considered to still hold, and surely no one\r\nwill grudge the commentators this amelioration of their lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n=C.= SUPPOSED REFERENCES TO AMERICA.—It is well known that Columbus’s\r\nhopes were in part based on passages in classical authors.[373]\r\nGlareanus, quoting Virgil in 1527, after Columbus’s discovery had made\r\nthe question of the ancient knowledge prominent, has been considered\r\nthe earliest to open the discussion;[374] and after this we find it a\r\ncommon topic in the early general writers on America, like Las Casas\r\n(_Historia General_), Ramusio (introd. vol. iii.), and Acosta (book i.\r\nch. 11, etc.)\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was not an uncommon\r\nsubject of academic and learned discussion.[375] It was a part of the\r\nsurvey made by many of the writers who discussed the origin of the\r\nAmerican tribes, like Garcia,[376] Lafitau,[377] Samuel Mather,[378]\r\nRobertson,[379] not to name others.\r\n\r\nIt was not till Humboldt compassed the subject in his _Examen Critique\r\nde l’histoire de la géographie du nouveau continent_ (Paris, 1836),\r\nthat the field was fully scanned with a critical spirit, acceptable to\r\nthe modern mind. He gives two of the five volumes which comprise the\r\nwork to this part of his subject, and very little has been added by\r\nlater research, while his conclusions still remain, on the whole, those\r\nof the most careful of succeeding writers. The French original is not\r\nequipped with guides to its contents, such as a student needs; but this\r\nis partly supplied by the index in the German translation.[380] The\r\nimpediments which the student encounters in the _Examen Critique_ are\r\na good deal removed in a book which is on the whole the easiest guide\r\nto the sources of the subject,—Paul Gaffarel’s _Etude sur les rapports\r\nde l’Amérique et de l’ancien continent avant Christophe Colomb_ (Paris,\r\n1869).[381]\r\n\r\nThe literature of the supposed old-world communication with America\r\nshows other phases of this question of ancient knowledge, and may be\r\ndivided, apart from the Greek embraced in the previous survey, into\r\nthose of the Egyptians, Phœnicians, Tyrians, Carthaginians, and Romans.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian theory has been mainly worked out in the present century.\r\nPaul Felix Cabrera’s _Teatro critico Americano_, printed with Rio’s\r\n_Palenqué_ (Lond., 1822), formulates the proofs. An essay by A.\r\nLenoir, comparing the Central American monuments with those of Egypt,\r\nis appended to Dupaix’s _Antiquités Méxicaines_ (1805). Delafield’s\r\n_Inquiry into the Origin of the Antiquities of America_ (Cincinnati,\r\n1839), traces it to the Cushites of Egypt, and cites Garcia y Cubas,\r\n_Ensayo de an Estudio Comparativo entre las Pirámides Egipcias y\r\nMéxicanas_. Brasseur de Bourbourg discussed the question, _S’il existe\r\ndes sources de l’histoire primitive du Méxique dans les monuments\r\négyptiens de l’histoire primitive de l’ancien monde dans les monuments\r\naméricains?_ in his ed. of Landa’s _Relations des Choses de Yucatan_\r\n(Paris, 1864). Buckle (_Hist. of Civilization_, i. ch. 2) believes the\r\nMexican civilization to have been strictly analogous to that of India\r\nand Egypt. Tylor (_Early Hist. of Mankind_, 98) compares the Egyptian\r\nhieroglyphics with those of the Aztecs. John T. C. Heaviside, _Amer.\r\nAntiquities, or the New World the Old, and the Old World the New_\r\n(London, 1868), maintains the reverse theory of the Egyptians being\r\nmigrated Americans. F. de Varnhagen works out his belief in _L’origine\r\ntouranienne des américains tupis-caribes et des anciens égyptiens\r\nmontrée principalement par la philologie comparée; et notice d’une\r\némigration en Amérique effectuée à travers l’Atlantique plusieurs\r\nsiècles avant notre ère_ (Vienne 1876).[382]\r\n\r\nAristotle’s mention of an island discovered by the Phœnicians was\r\nthought by Gomara and Oviedo to refer to America. The elder leading\r\nwriters on the origin of the Indians, like Garcia, Horn, De Laet, and\r\nat a later day Lafitau, discuss the Phœnician theory; as does Voss\r\nin his annotations on Pomponius Mela (1658), and Count de Gebelin\r\nin his _Monde primitif_ (Paris, 1781). In the present century the\r\nquestion has been touched by Cabrera in Rio’s _Palenqué_ (1822). R. A.\r\nWilson, in his _New Conquest of Mexico_, assigns (ch. v.) the ruins\r\nof Middle America to the Phœnicians. Morlot, in the _Actes de la\r\nSociété Jurassienne d’Emulation_ (1863), printed his “La découverte de\r\nl’Amérique par les Phènicièns.” Gaffarel sums up the evidences in a\r\npaper in the _Compte Rendu, Cong. des Amér._ (Nancy), i. 93.[383]\r\n\r\nThe Tyrian theory has been mainly sustained by a foolish book, by a\r\nfoolish man, _An Original History of Anc. America_ (London, 1843), by\r\nGeo. Jones, later known as the Count Johannes (cf. Bancroft’s _Native\r\nRaces_, v. 73).\r\n\r\nThe Carthaginian discovery rests mainly on the statements of Diodorus\r\nSiculus.[384]\r\n\r\nBaron Zach in his _Correspondenz_ undertakes to say that Roman voyages\r\nto America were common in the days of Seneca, and a good deal of wild\r\nspeculation has been indulged in.[385]\r\n\r\n\r\n=D.= ATLANTIS.—The story of Atlantis rests solely upon the authority\r\nof Plato, who sketched it in the _Timaeus_, and began an elaborated\r\nversion in the _Critias_ (if that fragment be by him), which old\r\nwriters often cite as the _Atlanticus_. This is frequently forgotten\r\nby those who try to establish the truth of the story, who often write\r\nas if all statements in print were equally available as “authorities,”\r\nand quote as corroborations of the tale all mentions of it made by\r\nclassical writers, regardless of the fact that all are later than\r\nPlato, and can no more than Ignatius Donnelly corroborate him. In\r\nfact, the ancients knew no better than we what to make of the story,\r\nand diverse opinions prevailed then as now. Many of these opinions\r\nare collected by Proclus in the first book of his commentary on\r\nthe _Timaeus_,[386] and all shades of opinion are represented from\r\nthose who, like Crantor, accepted the story as simply historical, to\r\nthose who regarded it as a mere fable. Still others, with Proclus\r\nhimself, accepted it as a record of actual events, while accounting\r\nfor its introduction in Plato by a variety of subtile metaphysical\r\ninterpretations. Proclus reports that Crantor, the first commentator\r\nupon Plato (_circa_ B.C. 300), asserted that the Egyptian priests said\r\nthat the story was written on pillars which were still preserved,[387]\r\nand he likewise quotes from the _Ethiopic History_ of Marcellus, a\r\nwriter of whom nothing else is known, a statement that according to\r\ncertain historians there were seven islands in the external sea sacred\r\nto Proserpine; and also three others of great size, one sacred to\r\nPluto, one to Ammon, and another, the middle one, a thousand stadia\r\nin size, sacred to Neptune. The inhabitants of it preserved the\r\nremembrance, from their ancestors, of the Atlantic island which existed\r\nthere, and was truly prodigiously great, which for many periods had\r\ndominion over all the islands in the Atlantic sea, and was itself\r\nsacred to Neptune.[388] Testimony like this is of little value in such\r\na case. What comes to us at third hand is more apt to need support\r\nthan give it; yet these two passages are the strongest evidence of\r\nknowledge of Atlantis outside of Plato that is preserved. We do indeed\r\nfind mention of it elsewhere and earlier. Thus Strabo[389] says that\r\nPosidonius (B.C. 135-51) suggested that, as the land was known to\r\nhave changed in elevation, Atlantis might not be a fiction, but that\r\nsuch an island-continent might actually have existed and disappeared.\r\nPliny[390] also mentions Atlantis in treating of changes in the\r\nearth’s surface, though he qualifies his quotation with “si Platoni\r\ncredimus.”[391] A mention of the story in a similar connection is made\r\nby Ammianus Marcellinus.[392]\r\n\r\nIn the Scholia to Plato’s _Republic_ it is said that at the great\r\nPanathenaea there was carried in procession a _peplum_ ornamented with\r\nrepresentations of the contest between the giants and the gods, while\r\non the _peplum_ carried in the little Panathenaea could be seen the\r\nwar of the Athenians against the Atlantides. Even Humboldt accepted\r\nthis as an independent testimony in favor of the antiquity of the\r\nstory; but Martin has shown that, apart from the total inconsistency\r\nof the report with the expressions of Plato, who places the narration\r\nof this forgotten deed of his countrymen at the celebration of the\r\nfestival of the little Panathenaea, the scholiast has only misread\r\nProclus, who states that the _peplum_ depicted the repulse of the\r\nbarbarians, _i. e._ Persians, by the Greeks.[393] To these passages\r\nit is customary to add references to the Meropian continent of\r\nTheopompus,[394] the Saturnian of Plutarch, the islands of Aristotle,\r\nDiodorus and Pausanias,—which is very much as if one should refer to\r\nthe _New Atlantis_ of Bacon as evidence for the existence of More’s\r\n_Utopia_.[395] Plutarch in his life of Solon attributes Solon’s having\r\ngiven up the idea of an epic upon Atlantis to his advanced age rather\r\nthan to want of leisure; but there is nothing to show that he had any\r\nevidence beyond Plato that Solon ever thought of such a poem, and Plato\r\ndoes not say that Solon began the poem, though Plutarch appears to\r\nhave so understood him.[396] Thus it seems more probable that all the\r\nreferences to Atlantis by ancient writers are derived from the story in\r\nPlato than that they are independent and corroborative statements.\r\n\r\nWith the decline of the Platonic school at Alexandria even the name\r\nof Atlantis readily vanished from literature. It is mentioned by\r\nTertullian,[397] and found a place in the strange system of Cosmas\r\nIndicopleustes,[398] but throughout the Middle Ages little or nothing\r\nwas known of it. That it was not quite forgotten appears from its\r\nmention in the _Image du Monde_, a poem of the thirteenth century,\r\nstill in MS., where it is assigned a location in the _Mer Betée_ (=\r\ncoagulée).[399] Plato was printed in Latin in 1483, 1484, 1491, and\r\nin Greek in 1513, and in 1534 with the commentary of Proclus on the\r\nTimaeus.[400] The _Timaeus_ was printed separately five times in the\r\nsixteenth century, and also in a French and an Italian translation.[401]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America doubtless added to the interest with which\r\nthe story was perused, and the old controversy flamed up with new\r\nardor. It was generally assumed that the account given by Plato was not\r\nhis invention. Opinions were, however, divided as to whether he had\r\ngiven a correct account. Of those who believed that he had erred as\r\nto the locality or as to the destruction of the island, some thought\r\nthat America was the true Atlantis, while others, with whose ideas\r\nwe have no concern here, placed Atlantis in Africa, Asia, or Europe,\r\nas prejudice led them. Another class of scholars, sensible of the\r\nnecessity of adhering to the text of the only extant account, accepted\r\nthe whole narrative, and endeavored to find in the geography of the\r\nAtlantic, or as indicated by the resemblances between the flora, fauna,\r\nand civilization of America and of the old world, additional reasons\r\nfor believing that such an island had once existed, and had disappeared\r\nafter serving as a bridge by which communication between the continents\r\nwas for a time carried on. The discussion was prolonged over centuries,\r\nand is not yet concluded. The wilder theories have been eliminated\r\nby time, and the contest may now be said to be between those who\r\naccept Plato’s tale as true and those who regard it as an invention.\r\nThe latter view is at present in favor with the most conservative\r\nand careful scholars, but the other will always find advocates.\r\nThat Atlantis was America was maintained by Gomara, Guillaume de\r\nPostel, Horn, and others incidentally, and by Birchrod in a special\r\ntreatise,[402] which had some influence even upon the geographer\r\nCellarius. In 1669 the Sansons published a map showing America divided\r\namong the descendants of Neptune as Atlantis was divided, and even as\r\nlate as 1762 Vaugondy reproduced it.[403] In his edition of Plato,\r\nStallbaum expressed his belief that the Egyptians might have had some\r\nknowledge of America.[404] Cluverius thought the story was due to a\r\nknowledge of America.[405]\r\n\r\nVery lately Hyde Clark has found in the Atlantis fable evidence\r\nof a knowledge of America: he does not believe in the connecting\r\nisland Atlantis, but he holds that Plato misinterpreted some account\r\nof America which had reached him.[406] Except for completeness it\r\nis scarcely worth mentioning that Blackett, whose work can really\r\nbe characterized by no other word than absurd, sees America in\r\nAtlantis.[407]\r\n\r\nHere should be mentioned a work by Berlioux, which puts Euhemerus to\r\nthe blush in the manner in which history with much detail is extorted\r\nfrom mythology.[408] He holds that Atlantis was the northwestern coast\r\nof Africa; that under Ouranos and Atlas, astronomers and kings, it was\r\nthe seat of a great empire which had conquered portions of America and\r\nkept a lively commercial intercourse with that country.\r\n\r\nOrtelius in several places speaks of the belief that America was the\r\nold Atlantis, and also attributes that belief to Mercator.[409]\r\n\r\nThat Atlantis might really have existed[410] and disappeared, leaving\r\nthe Atlantic islands as remnants, was too evident to escape notice.\r\nOrtelius suggested that the island of Gades might be a fragment of\r\nAtlantis,[411] and the doctrine was early a favorite. Kircher, in his\r\nvery curious work on the subterranean world, devotes considerable space\r\nto Atlantis, rejecting its connection with America, while he maintains\r\nits former existence, and holds that the Azores, Canaries, and other\r\nAtlantic islands were formerly parts thereof, and that they showed\r\ntraces of volcanic fires in his day.[412]\r\n\r\nLas Casas in his history of the Indies devoted an entire chapter to\r\nAtlantis, quoting the arguments of Proclus, in his commentary on\r\nPlato, in favor of the story, though he is himself more doubtful. He\r\nalso cites confirmative passages from Philo and St. Anselm, etc. He\r\nconsiders the question of the Atlantic isles, and cites authorities for\r\ngreat and sudden changes in the earth’s surface.[413]\r\n\r\nThe same view was taken by Becman,[414] and Fortia D’Urban. Turnefort\r\nincluded America in the list of remnants; and De la Borde followed\r\nSanson in extending Atlantis to the farthest Pacific islands.[415] Bory\r\nde St. Vincent,[416] again, limited Atlantis to the Atlantic, and gave\r\non a map his ideas of its contour.\r\n\r\nD’Avezac maintains this theory in his _Iles africaines de l’Océan\r\nAtlantique_,[417] p. 5-8. Carli devoted a large part of the second\r\nvolume of his _Lettere Americane_ to Atlantis, controverting Baily,\r\nwho placed Atlantis in Spitzbergen. Carli goes at considerable length\r\ninto the topographical and geological arguments in favor of its\r\nexistence.[418] The early naturalists, when the doctrine of great and\r\nsudden changes in the earth’s surface was in favor, were inclined\r\nto look with acquiescence on this belief. Even Lyell confessed a\r\ntemptation to accept the theory of an Atlantis island in the northern\r\nAtlantic, though he could not see in the Atlantic islands trace of a\r\nmid-Atlantic bridge.[419] About the middle of this century scholars\r\nin several departments of learning, accepting the evidences of\r\nresemblances between the product of the old and new world, were induced\r\nto turn gladly to such a connection as would have been offered by\r\nAtlantis; and the results obtained at about the same time by studies in\r\nthe pre-Columbian traditions and civilization of Mexico were brought\r\nforward as supporting the same theory. That the Antilles were remnants\r\nof Atlantis; that the Toltecs were descendants from the panic-stricken\r\nfugitives of the great catastrophe, whose terrors were recorded in\r\ntheir traditions, as well as in those of the Egyptians, was ardently\r\nurged by Brasseur de Bourbourg.[420]\r\n\r\nIn 1859 Retzius announced that he found a close resemblance between the\r\nskulls of the Guanches of the Canaries and the Guaranas of Brazil, and\r\nrecalled the Atlantis story to explain it.[421] In 1846 Forbes declared\r\nhis belief in the former existence of a bridge of islands in the North\r\nAtlantic, and in 1856 Heer attempted to show the necessity of a similar\r\nconnection from the testimony of palæontological botany.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Unger deliberately advocated the Atlantis hypothesis to\r\nexplain the likeness between the fossil flora of Europe and the living\r\nflora of America, enumerating over fifty similar species; and Kuntze\r\nfound in the case of the tropical seedless banana, occurring at once in\r\nAmerica before 1492 and in Africa, a strong evidence of the truth of\r\nthe theory.[422]\r\n\r\nA condensed review of the scientific side of the question is given\r\nby A. Boué in his article _Ueber die Rolle der Veränderungen des\r\nunorganischen Festen im grossen Massstabe in der Natur_.[423]\r\n\r\nThe deep-sea soundings taken in the Atlantic under the auspices of\r\nthe governments of the United States, England, and Germany resulted\r\nin discoveries which gave a new impetus to the Atlantis theory.\r\nIt was shown that, starting from the Arctic plateau, a ridge runs\r\ndown the middle of the Atlantic, broadening toward the Azores, and\r\ncontracting again as it trends toward the northeast coast of South\r\nAmerica. The depth over the ridge is less than 1,000 fathoms, while\r\nthe valleys on either side average 3,000; it is known after the U. S.\r\nvessel which took the soundings as the Dolphin ridge. A similar though\r\nmore uniformly narrow ridge was found by the “Challenger” expedition\r\n(1873-76), extending from somewhat north of Ascension Island directly\r\nsouth between South America and Africa. It is known as the Challenger\r\nridge. There is, beside, evidence for the existence of a ridge across\r\nthe tropical Atlantic, connecting the Dolphin and Challenger ridges.\r\nMadeira, the Canaries, and the Cape Verde Islands are cut off from\r\nthese ridges by a deep valley, but are connected by shoals with the\r\ncontinent. Upon the publication of the Challenger chart (_Special\r\nReport_, vii. 1876), those who favored the theory of communication\r\nbetween the continents were not slow to appropriate its disclosures in\r\ntheir interests (_Nature_, Dec. 21, 1876, xv. 158). In March, 1877, W.\r\nStephen Mitchell delivered a lecture at South Kensington, wherein he\r\nplaced in juxtaposition the theory of Unger and the revelations of the\r\ndeep-sea soundings, when he announced, however, that he did not mean\r\nto assert that these ridges had ever formed a connecting link above\r\nwater between the continents.[424] Others were less cautious,[425] but\r\nin general this interpretation did not commend itself as strongly to\r\nconservative men of science as it might have done a few years before,\r\nbecause such men were gradually coming to doubt the fact of changes of\r\ngreat moment in the earth’s surface, even those of great duration.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, M. Paul Gaffarel published his first treatise on\r\nAtlantis,[426] advocating the truth of the story, and in 1880 he made\r\nit the subject of deeper research, utilizing the facts which ocean\r\nexploration had placed at command.[427] This is the best work which has\r\nappeared upon this side of the question, and can only be set against\r\nthe earlier work by Martin.[428] The same theory has been supported\r\nby D. P. de Novo y Colson, who went so far as to predict the ultimate\r\nrecovery of some Atlantean manuscripts from submarine grottoes of some\r\nof the Atlantic islands,—a hope which surpasses Mr. Donnelly.[429]\r\n\r\nWinchell found the theory too useful in his scheme of ethnology to be\r\nrejected,[430] but it was reserved for Ignatius Donnelly to undertake\r\nthe arrangement of the deductions of modern science and the data of\r\nold traditions into a set argument for the truth of Plato’s story. His\r\nbook,[431] in many ways a rather clever statement of the argument, so\r\nevidently presented only the evidence in favor of his view, and that\r\nwith so little critical estimate of authorities and weight of evidence,\r\nthat it attracted only uncomplimentary notice from the scientific\r\npress.[432] It was, however, the first long presentation of the case\r\nin English, and as such made an impression on many laymen. In 1882\r\nwas also published the second volume of the _Challenger Narrative_,\r\ncontaining a report by M. Renard on the geologic character of the\r\nmid-Atlantic island known as St. Paul’s rocks. The other Atlantic\r\nislands are confessedly of volcanic origin, and this, which laymen\r\ninterpreted in favor of the Atlantis theory, militated with men of\r\nscience against the view that they were remnants of a sunken continent.\r\nSt. Paul’s, however, was, as noted by Darwin, of doubtful character,\r\nand Renard came to the conclusion that it was composed of crystalline\r\nschists, and had therefore probably been once overlaid by masses since\r\nremoved.[433] This conclusion, which tended in favor of Atlantis, was\r\ncontroverted by A. Geikie[434] and by M. E. Wadsworth,[435] (the latter\r\nhaving personally inspected specimens,) on the ground that the rocks\r\nwere volcanic in origin, and that, had they been schists, the inference\r\nof denudation would not follow. Dr. Guest declared that ethnologists\r\nhave fully as good cause as the botanists to regard Atlantis as a\r\nfact.[436] A. J. Weise in treating of the Discoveries of America\r\nadopted the Atlantis fable unhesitatingly, and supposes that America\r\nwas known to the Egyptians through that channel.[437]\r\n\r\nThat the whole story was invented by Plato as a literary ornament\r\nor allegorical argument, or that he thus utilized a story which he\r\nhad really received from Egypt, but which was none the less a myth,\r\nwas maintained even among the early Platonists, and was the view of\r\nLonginus. Even after the discovery of America many writers recognized\r\nthe fabulous touch in it, as Acosta,[438] who thought, “being well\r\nconsidered, they are rediculous things, resembling rather to _Ovid’s_\r\ntales then a Historie of Philosophie worthy of accompt,” and “cannot be\r\nheld for true but among children and old folkes”—an opinion adopted by\r\nthe judicious Cellarius.[439]\r\n\r\nAmong more recent writers, D’Anville, Bartoli,[440] Gosselin,[441]\r\nUkert,[442] approved this view.\r\n\r\nHumboldt threw the weight of his great influence in favor of the\r\nmythical interpretation, though he found the germ of the story in\r\nthe older geographic myth of the destruction of Lyctonia in the\r\nMediterranean (Orph. _Argonaut._, 1274, etc.);[443] while Martin, in\r\nhis work on the _Timaeus_, with great learning and good sense, reduced\r\nthe story to its elements, concluding that such an island had never\r\nexisted, the tale was not invented by Plato, but had really descended\r\nto him from Solon, who had heard it in Egypt.\r\n\r\nProf. Jowett regards the entire narrative as “due to the imagination of\r\nPlato, who could easily invent ‘Egyptians or anything else,’ and who\r\nhas used the name of Solon ... and the tradition of the Egyptian priest\r\nto give verisimilitude to his story;”[444] and Bunbury is of the same\r\nopinion, regarding the story as “a mere fiction,” and “no more intended\r\nto be taken seriously ... than the tale of Er the Pamphylian.”[445] Mr.\r\nArcher-Hind, the editor of the only separate edition of the _Timaeus_\r\nwhich has appeared in England, thinks it impossible to determine\r\n“whether Plato has invented the story from beginning to end, or whether\r\nit really more or less represents some Egyptian legend brought home by\r\nSolon,” which seems to be a fitting conclusion to the whole matter.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the subject is widely scattered, but a good deal has\r\nbeen done bibliographically in some works which have been reserved\r\nfor special mention here. The earliest is the _Dissertation sur\r\nl’Atlantide_, by Th. Henri Martin,[446] wherein, beside a carefully\r\nreasoned examination of the story itself and similar geographic myths,\r\nthe opposing views of previous writers are set forth in the second\r\nsection, _Histoire des Systèmes sur l’Atlantide_, pp. 258-280. Gaffarel\r\nhas in like manner given a résumé of the literature, which comes down\r\nlater than that of Martin, in the two excellent treatises which he has\r\ndevoted to the subject; he is convinced of the existence of such an\r\nisland, but his work is marked by such care, orderliness, and fulness\r\nof citations that it is of the greatest value.[447] The references\r\nin these treatises are made with intelligence, and are, in general,\r\naccurate and useful. That this is not the case with the work of Mr.\r\nDonnelly deprives the volume of much of the value which it might have\r\nhad.[448]\r\n\r\n\r\n=E.= FABULOUS ISLANDS OF THE ATLANTIC IN THE MIDDLE AGES.—Fabulous\r\nislands belong quite as much to the domain of folk-lore as to that of\r\ngeography. The legends about them form a part of the great mass of\r\nsuperstitions connected with the sea. What has been written about these\r\nisland myths is for the most part scattered in innumerable collections\r\nof folk-tales and in out-of-the-way sources, and it does not lie within\r\nthe scope of the present sketch to track in these directions all that\r\nhas been said. It will not be out of place, however, to refer to a\r\nfew recent works where much information and many references can be\r\nfound. One of the fullest collections, though not over-well sorted,\r\nis by Lieut. F. S. Bassett,[449] consisting of brief notes made in\r\nthe course of wide reading, well provided with references, which are,\r\nhowever, often so abbreviated as to inflict much trouble on those who\r\nwould consult them,—an all too common fault. Of interest is a chapter\r\non _Les îles_, in a similar work by M. Paul Sebillot.[450] An island\r\nhome has often been assigned to the soul after death, and many legends,\r\nsome mediæval, some of great antiquity, deal with such islands, or with\r\nvoyages to them. Some account of these will be found in Bassett, and\r\nparticularly in an article by E. Beauvois in the _Revue de l’histoire\r\nde Religion_,[451] where further references are to be found. Wm.\r\nF. Warren has also collected many references to the literature of\r\nthis subject in the course of his endeavor to show that Paradise was\r\nat the North Pole.[452] The long articles on _Eden_ and _Paradise_\r\nin McClintock and Strong’s _Biblical Encyclopedia_ should also be\r\nconsulted.\r\n\r\nIn what way the fabulous islands of the Atlantic originated is not\r\nknown, nor has the subject been exhaustively investigated. The islands\r\nof classical times, in part actual discoveries, in part born of\r\nconfused reports of actual discoveries, and in part probably purely\r\nmythical, were very generally forgotten as ancient civilization\r\ndeclined.[453] The other islands which succeeded them were in part\r\nreminiscences of the islands known to the ancients or invented by\r\nthem, and in part products of a popular mythology, as old perhaps as\r\nthat of the Greeks, but until now unknown to letters. The writers who\r\nhave dealt with these islands have treated them generally from the\r\npurely geographic point of view. The islands are known principally\r\nfrom maps, beginning with the fourteenth century, and are not often\r\nmet with in descriptive works. Formaleoni, in his attempt to show\r\nthat the Venetians had discovered the West Indies prior to Columbus,\r\nmade studies of the older maps which naturally led him to devote\r\nconsiderable attention to these islands.[454]\r\n\r\nThey are also considered by Zurla.[455] The first general account of\r\nthem was given by Humboldt in the _Examen Critique_,[456] and to what\r\nhe did little if anything has since been added. D’Avezac[457] treated\r\nthe subject, giving a brief sketch of the islands known to the Arab\r\ngeographers,—a curious matter which deserves more attention.\r\n\r\nStill more recently Paul Gaffarel has treated the matter briefly, but\r\ncarefully.[458] A study of old maps by H. Wuttke, in the _Jahresbericht\r\ndes Vereins für Erdkunde zu Dresden_,[459] gives considerable attention\r\nto the islands; and Theobald Fischer, in his commentary on the\r\ncollection of maps reproduced by Ongania, has briefly touched on the\r\nsubject,[460] as has Cornelio Desimoni in various papers in the _Atti\r\ndella Società Ligure di Storia patria_, xiv., and other years, in the\r\n_Atti dell’ Acad. dei Nuova Lincei_, in the _Gionale ligustico_, etc.\r\nR. H. Major’s _Henry the Navigator_ should also be consulted.[461]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the term mythical islands ought to include, if not\r\nFrisland and Drogeo, at least the land of Bus, the island of Bimini\r\nwith its fountain of life, an echo of one of the oldest of folk-tales,\r\nthe island of Saxenburg, and the other non-existent islands, shoals,\r\nand rocks, with which the imagination of sailors and cartographers have\r\nconnected the Atlantic even into the present century. In fact, the\r\nname is by common consent restricted to certain islands which occur\r\nconstantly on old charts: the Island of St. Brandan, Antillia or Isle\r\nof the Seven Cities, Satanaxio, Danmar, Brazil, Mayda, and Isla Verte.\r\nIt is interesting to note that the Arab geographers had their fabulous\r\nislands, too, though so little is known of them that it is at present\r\nimpossible to say what relation they bear to those mentioned. They say\r\nthat Ptolemy assigned 25,000 islands to the Atlantic, but they name\r\nand describe seventeen only, among which we may mention the Eternal\r\nIslands (Canaries? Azores?),[462] El-Ghanam (Madeira?), Island of the\r\nTwo Sorcerers (Lancerote?), etc.[463]\r\n\r\nThere has been some difference of opinion as to which of the Atlantic\r\nislands answer to the ancient conception of the Fortunate Islands. It\r\nis probable that the idea is at the bottom of several of these, but it\r\nmay be doubted whether the island of St. Brandan is not entirely due to\r\nthe christianizing of this ancient fable.\r\n\r\nWe proceed now to examine the accounts of some of these islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. BRANDAN.—St. Brandan, or Brendan, who died May 16, 577, was Abbot\r\nof Cluainfert, in Ireland, according to the legend, where he was\r\nvisited by a friend, Barontus, who told him that far in the ocean lay\r\nan island which was the land promised to the saints. St. Brandan set\r\nsail for this island in company with 75 monks, and spent seven years\r\nupon the ocean, in two voyages (according to the Irish text in the\r\nMS. _book of Lismore_, which is probably the most archaic form of the\r\nlegend), discovering this island and many others equally marvellous,\r\nincluding one which turned out to be the back of a huge fish, upon\r\nwhich they celebrated Easter. This story cannot be traced beyond the\r\neleventh century, its oldest form being a Latin prose version in a\r\nMS. of that century. It is known also in French, English, and German\r\ntranslations, both prose and verse, and was evidently a great favorite\r\nin the Middle Ages. Intimately connected with the St. Brandan legend\r\nis that of St. Malo, or Maclovius, Bishop of Aleth, in Armorica, a\r\ndisciple of St. Brandan, who accompanied his superior, and whose\r\neulogists, jealous of the fame of the Irish saint, provided for the\r\nyounger a voyage on his own account, with marvels transcending those\r\nfound by Brandan. His church-day is November 17th. The story of St.\r\nBrandan is given by Humboldt and D’Avezac,[464] and by Gaffarel.[465]\r\nFurther accounts will be found in the _Acta Sanctorum_ of the\r\nBollandists,[466] and in the introductions and notes to the numerous\r\neditions of the voyages, among which reference only need be made to the\r\noriginal Latin edited by M. Jubinal,[467] and to the English version\r\nedited by Thomas Wright for the Percy Society.[468] A Latin text of the\r\nfourteenth century is now to be found in the _Acta Sanctorum Hiberniae\r\nex codice Salmanticensi nunc premium integre edita opera C. de Smedt\r\net J. de Backer_ (Edinb. etc., 1888), 4to, pp. 111-154. As is well\r\nknown, Philoponus gives an account of the voyages of St. Brandan with a\r\ncurious map, in which he places the island N. W. of Spain and N. E. of\r\nthe Canaries, or _Insulae Fortunatae_.[469] The island of St. Brandan\r\nwas at first apparently imagined in the north, but it afterward took a\r\nmore southerly location. Honoré d’Autun identifies it with a certain\r\nisland called Perdita, once discovered and then lost in the Atlantic;\r\nwe have here, perhaps, some reminiscence of the name “Aprositos,” which\r\nPtolemy bestows on one of the _Fortunatae Insulae_.[470] In some of\r\nthe earlier maps there is an inlet on the west coast of Ireland called\r\n_Lacus Fortunatus_, which is packed with islands which are called\r\n_Insulae Fortunatae_ or _Beatae_, and sometimes given as 300 or 368\r\nin number.[471] But the Pizigani map of 1367 puts the _Isole dicte\r\nFortunate S. Brandany_ in the place of Madeira; and Behaim’s globe, in\r\n1492, sets it down in the latitude of Cape de Verde,—a legend against\r\nit assigning the discovery to St. Brandan in 565.\r\n\r\nIt is this island which was long supposed to be seen as a mountainous\r\nland southeast of the Canaries. After the discovery of the Azores\r\nexpeditions were fitted out to search for it, and were continued until\r\n1721, which are described by Viera, and have been since retold by all\r\nwriters on the subject.[472] The island was again reported as seen in\r\n1759.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTILLIA, OR ISLE OF SEVEN CITIES.—The largest of these islands, the\r\none most persistent in its form and location, is Antillia, which is\r\ndepicted as a large rectangular island, extending from north to south,\r\nlying in the mid-Atlantic about lat. 35° N. This island first appears\r\non the map of 1424, preserved at Weimar, and is found on the principal\r\nmaps of the rest of the century, notably in the Bianco of 1436.[473] On\r\nsome maps of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries appears a smaller\r\nisland under the name of Sette Citade, or Sete Ciudades, which is\r\nproperly another name for Antillia, as Toscanelli says in his famous\r\nletter, wherein he recommended Antillia as likely to be useful as a\r\nway-station on the India voyage. We owe to Behaim the preservation on\r\nhis globe of 1492 of the legend of this island. It was discovered and\r\nsettled, according to him, by refugees from Spain in 714, after the\r\ndefeat of King Roderick by the Moors. The settlers were accompanied by\r\nan archbishop and six bishops, each of whom built him a town. There\r\nis a story that the island was rediscovered by a Portuguese sailor in\r\n1447.[474]\r\n\r\nIn apparent connection with _Antillia_ are the smaller islands _Danmar_\r\nor _Tanmar_, _Reillo_ or _Royllo_, and _Satanaxio_. The latter alone\r\nis of special interest. Formaleoni found near Antillia, on the map of\r\nBianco of 1436, an island with a name which he read as “Y.^d laman\r\nSatanaxio,”—a name which much perplexed him, until he found, in an\r\nold Italian romance, a legend that in a certain part of India a great\r\nhand arose every day from the sea and carried off the inhabitants into\r\nthe ocean. Adapting this tale to the west, he translated the name\r\n“Island of the hand of Satan,”[475] in which interpretation Humboldt\r\nacquiesced. D’Avezac, however, was inclined to think that there were\r\ntwo islands, one called Delamar, a name which elsewhere appears as\r\nDanmar or Tanmar, and Satanaxio, or, as it appears on a map by Beccario\r\nat Parma, _Satanagio_,[476] and suggests that the word is a corrupt\r\nform for S. Atanaxio or S. Atanagio, i. e. St. Athanasius, with which\r\nGaffarel is inclined to agree.[477]\r\n\r\nFormaleoni saw in _Antillia_ a foreknowledge of the Antilles, and\r\nHassel believed that North and South America were respectively\r\nrepresented by Satanaxio and Antillia, with a strait between, just as\r\nthe American continent was indeed represented after the discovery. It\r\nis certainly curious that Beccario designates the group of Antillia,\r\nSatanagio, and Danmar, as _Isle de novo reperte_, the name afterwards\r\napplied to the discoveries of Columbus; but it is not now believed that\r\nthe fifteenth-century islands were aught but geographical fancies. To\r\ntransfer their names to the real discoveries was of course easy and\r\nnatural.[478]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAZIL.—Among the islands which prefigured the Azores on\r\nfourteenth-century maps appears _I. de Brazi_ on the Medicean portulano\r\nof 1351, and it is apparently Terceira or San Miguel.[479] On the\r\nPizigani map of 1367 appear three islands with this name, _Insula de\r\nBracir_ or _Bracie_, two not far from the Azores, and one off the south\r\nor southeast end of Ireland. On the Catalan map of 1375 is an _Insula\r\nde Brazil_ in the southern part of the so-called Azores group, and an\r\n_Insula de Brazil_ (?) applied to a group of small islands enclosed\r\nin a heavy black ring west of Ireland. The same reduplication occurs\r\nin the Solerio of 1385, in a map of 1426 preserved at Regensburg,\r\nin Bianco’s map of 1436, and in that of 1448: here _de Braxil_ is\r\nthe easternmost of the Azores group (i. e. _y de Colombi, de Zorzi_,\r\netc.), while the large round island—more like a large ink-blot than\r\nanything else—west of Ireland is _y de Brazil d. binar_.[480] In a map\r\nin St. Mark’s Library, Venice, dated about 1450, Brazil appears in\r\nfour places. Fra Mauro puts it west of Ireland,[481] and it so appears\r\nin Ptolemy of 1519, and Ramusio in 1556; but Mercator and Ortelius\r\ninscribe it northwest of the Azores.\r\n\r\nHumboldt has shown[482] that brazil-wood, being imported into Europe\r\nfrom the East Indies long before the discovery of America, gave its\r\nname to the country in the west where it was found in abundance, and\r\nhe infers that the designation of the Atlantic island was derived from\r\nthe same source. The duplication of the name, however, seems to point\r\nto a confusion of different traditions, and in the Brazil off Ireland\r\nwe doubtless have an attempt to establish the mythical island of _Hy\r\nBrazil_, or _O’Brasile_, which plays a part as a vanishing island in\r\nIrish legends, although it cannot be traced to its origin. In the epic\r\nliterature of Ireland relating to events of the sixth and subsequent\r\ncenturies, and which was probably written down in the twelfth, there\r\nare various stories of ocean voyages, some involuntary, some voluntary,\r\nand several, like the voyage of the sons of Ua Corra about 540, of St.\r\nBrandan about 560, and of Mailduin in the eighth century, taking place\r\nin the Atlantic, and resulting in the discovery of numerous fabulous\r\nislands.[483] The name of Brazil does not appear in these early\r\nrecords, but it seems to belong to the same class of legends.[484]\r\nIt is first mentioned, as far as I know, by William Betoner, called\r\nWilliam of Worcester, who calls the island _Brasyle_ and _Brasylle_,\r\nand says that July 15, 1480, his brother-in-law, John Jay, began a\r\nvoyage from Bristol in search of the island, returning Sept. 18 without\r\nhaving found it.[485] This evidently belongs to the series of voyages\r\nmade by Bristol men in search of this island, which is mentioned\r\nby Pedro d’Ayala, the Spanish ambassador to England, in his famous\r\nletter of July 25, 1498, where he says that such voyages in search of\r\n_Brazylle_ and the _seven cities_ had been made for seven years past,\r\n“according to the fancies of the Genoese,” meaning Sebastian Cabot.[486]\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the search for Brazil was of older date than Cabot’s\r\narrival. He probably gave an additional impetus to the custom, adding\r\nto the stories of the fairy isles the legends of the _Sette Citade_ or\r\n_Antillia_. Hardiman,[487] quoting from a MS. history of Ireland, in\r\nthe library of the Royal Irish Academy, written about 1636, mentions\r\nan “iland, which lyeth far att sea, on the west of Connaught, and some\r\ntimes is perceived by the inhabitants of the _Oules_ and _Iris_ ... and\r\nfrom Saint Helen Head. Like wise several seamen have discovered it, ...\r\none of whom, named Captain Rich, who lives about Dublin, of late years\r\nhad a view of the land, and was so neere that he discovered a harbour\r\n... but could never make to land” because of “a mist which fell upon\r\nhim.... Allsoe in many old mappes ... you still find it by the name of\r\n_O’Brasile_ under the longitude of 03°, 00´, and the latitude of 50°\r\n20´.”[488] In 1675 a pretended account of a visit to this island was\r\npublished in London, which is reprinted by Hardiman.[489]\r\n\r\nAn account of the island as seen from Arran given in O’Flaherty’s\r\n_Sketch of the Island of Arran_,[490] is quoted by H. Halliday\r\nSterling, _Irish Minstrelsy_, p. 307 (London, 1887). Mr. Marshall, in a\r\nnote in _Notes and Queries_, Sept. 22, 1883 (6th s., viii. 224), quotes\r\nGuest, _Origines Celticae_ (London, 1883), i. 126, and R. O’Flaherty,\r\n_Ogygia, sive rerum Hibernicarum chronologiae_ (London, 1685; also\r\nin English translation, Dublin, 1793), as speaking of O’Brazile. The\r\nlatter work I have not seen. Mr. Marshall also quotes a familiar\r\nallusion to it by Jeremy Taylor (_Dissuasive from Popery_, 1667). This\r\nnote was replied to in the same periodical, Dec. 15, 1883, by Mr.\r\nKerslake, “N.” and W. Fraser. Fraser’s interest had been attracted by\r\nthe entry of the island—much smaller than usual—on a map of the French\r\nGeographer Royal, Le Sieur Tassin, 1634-1652, and he read a paper\r\nbefore the Geological Society of Ireland, Jan. 20, 1870, suggesting\r\nthat Brazil might be the present _Porcupine Bank_, once above water.\r\nOn the same map _Rockall_ is laid down as two islands, where but a\r\nsolitary rock is now known.[491] Brasil appears on the maps of the last\r\ntwo centuries, with _Mayda_ and _Isle Verte_, and even on the great\r\nAtlas by Jefferys, 1776, is inserted, although called “imaginary island\r\nof O’Brasil.” It grows constantly smaller, but within the second half\r\nof this century has appeared on the royal Admiralty charts as _Brazil\r\nRock_.[492]\r\n\r\nIt would be too tedious to enumerate the numerous other imaginary\r\nislands of the Atlantic to which clouds, fogs, and white caps have\r\nfrom time to time given rise. They are marked on all charts of the\r\nlast century in profusion; mention, however, may be made of the “land\r\nof _Bus_” or _Busse_, which Frobisher’s expedition coasted along in\r\n1576, and which has been hunted for with the lead even as late as 1821,\r\nthough in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=F.= TOSCANELLI’S ATLANTIC OCEAN.—It has been shown elsewhere (Vol.\r\nII. pp. 30, 31, 38, 90, 101, 103) that Columbus in the main accepted\r\nthe view of the width of the Atlantic, on the farther side of which\r\nAsia was supposed to be, which Toscanelli had calculated; and it has\r\nnot been quite certain what actual measurement should be given to this\r\nwidth, but recent discoveries tend to make easier a judgment in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWhen Humboldt wrote the _Examen Critique_, Toscanelli’s letter to\r\nColumbus, of unknown date,[493] enclosing a copy of the one he sent\r\nto Martinez in 1474, was known only in the Italian form in Ulloa’s\r\ntranslation of the _Historie del S. D. Fernando Colombo_ (Venice,\r\n1571), and in the Spanish translation of Ulloa’s version by Barcia\r\nin the _Historiades primitivos de las Indias occidentales_ (Madrid,\r\n1749), i. 5 bis, which was reprinted by Navarrete, _Coleccion de los\r\nviages y descubrimientos_, etc., ii. p. 1. In the letter to Martinez,\r\nin this form, it is said that there are in the map which accompanied it\r\ntwenty-six _spaces_ between Lisbon and _Quisai_, each space containing\r\n250 miles according to the Ulloa version, but according to the\r\nre-translation of Barcia 150 miles. This, with several other changes\r\nmade by Barcia, were followed by Navarrete and accepted as correct\r\nby Humboldt, who severely censures Ximenes for adopting the Italian\r\nrendering in his _Gnomone fiorent_. But the Latin copy of the letter in\r\nColumbus’s handwriting, discovered by Harrisse and made public (with\r\nfac-simile) in his _D. Fernando Colon_ (Seville, 1871),[494] sustained\r\nthe correctness of Ulloa’s version, giving 250 miliaria to the space.\r\nThis authoritative rendering also showed that while the translator\r\nhad in general followed the text, he had twice inserted a translation\r\nof miles into degrees, and once certainly, incorrectly, making in\r\none place 100 miles = 35 leagues, and in another, 2,500 miles = 225\r\nleagues. Probably this discrepancy led to the omissions made by Barcia;\r\nhe was wrong, however, in changing the number 250, supposing the 150\r\nnot to be a typographical error, and in omitting the phrase, “which\r\nspace (from Lisbon to Quinsai) is about the third part of the sphere.”\r\nThe Latin text showed, too, that this whole passage about distances was\r\nnot in the Martinez letter at all, but formed the end of the letter\r\nto Columbus, since in the Latin it follows the date of the Martinez\r\nletter, into which it has been interpolated by a later hand. Finally\r\nthe publication of Las Casas’s _Historia de las Indias_ (Madrid, 1875)\r\ngave us another Spanish version, which differs from Barcia’s in closely\r\nagreeing with the Ulloa version, and which gives the length of a space\r\nat 250 miles.\r\n\r\nThere were then 26 × 250 = 6500 miles between Lisbon and Quinsai, and\r\nthis was about one third of the circumference of the earth in this\r\nlatitude, but it is not clear whether Roman or Italian miles were meant.\r\n\r\nIf the MS. in the Biblioteca Nazionale at Florence [_Cod.\r\nMagliabechiano Classe_ xi. _num._ 121], described by G. Uzielli in the\r\n_Bollettino della Società Geografica Italiana_, x. 1 (1873), 13-28\r\n(“Ricerche intorno a Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli, ii. Della grandezza\r\ndella terra secondo Paolo Toscanelli”), actually represents the work\r\nof Toscanelli, it is of great value in settling this point. The MS.\r\nis inscribed “Discorso di M^o Paolo Puteo Toscanelli sopra la cometa\r\ndel 1456.” In it were found two papers: 1. A plain projection in\r\nrectangular form apparently for use in sketching a map. It is divided\r\ninto spaces, each subdivided into five degrees, and numbers 36 spaces\r\nin length. It is believed by Sig. Uzielli that this is the form used in\r\nthe map sent to Martinez. If this be so, the 26 spaces between Lisbon\r\nand Quinsai = 130°. 2. A list of the latitude and longitude of various\r\nlocalities, at the end of which is inscribed this table:\r\n\r\n  Gradus continet .68 miliaria minus 3ª unius.\r\n  Miliarum tria millia bracchia.\r\n  Bracchium duos palmas.\r\n  Palmus. 12. uncias. 7. filos.\r\n\r\nThe Florentine mile of 3,000 braccia da terra contains, according to\r\nSig. Uzielli, 1653.6^m. (as against 1481^m. to the Roman mile). Hence\r\nToscanelli estimated a degree of the meridian at 111,927^m, or only\r\n552^m. more than the mean adopted by Bessel and Bayer. Since, according\r\nto the letter, one space = 250 miles, and by the map one space = 5°,\r\nwe have 50 miles to a degree, which would point to an estimate for a\r\nlatitude of about 42°, allowing 67 2-3 miles to an equatorial degree.\r\nLisbon was entered in the table of Alphonso at 41° N. (true lat. 38°\r\n41’ N.) By this reckoning Quinsai would fall 124° west of Lisbon or\r\n10° west of San Francisco. It does not appear that the Florence MS.\r\ncan be traced directly to Toscanelli, but the probability is certainly\r\nstrong that we have here some of the astronomer’s working papers, and\r\nthat Ximenes did not deserve the rebuke administered by Humboldt for\r\nallowing 250 miles to a space, and assuming that a space contained\r\nfive degrees. Certainly Humboldt’s use of 150 miles is unjustifiable,\r\nand his calculation of 52° as the angular distance between Lisbon and\r\nQuinsai, according to Toscanelli, is very much too small, whatever\r\nstandard we take for the mile. If we follow Uzielli, the result\r\nobtained by Ruge (_Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen_, p.\r\n230), 104°, is also too small.[495]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAFFAREL’S MAP.\r\n\r\nFrom a map by Gaffarel, “L’Océan Atlantique et les restes de\r\nl’Atlantide,” in the _Revue de Géographie_, vi. p. 400, accompanying a\r\npaper by Gaffarel in the numbers for April-July, 1880, and showing such\r\nrocks and islets as have from time to time been reported as seen, or\r\nthought to have been seen, and which Gaffarel views as vestiges of the\r\nlost continent.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=G.= EARLY MAPS OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.—_By the Editor_—The\r\ncartographical history of the Atlantic Ocean is, even down to our own\r\nday, an odd mixture of uncertain fact and positive fable. The island of\r\nBresil or Brazil was only left off the British Admiralty charts within\r\ntwenty years (see Vol. II. p. 36), and editions of the most popular\r\natlases, like Colton’s, within twenty-five years have shown Jacquet\r\nIsland, the Three Chimneys, Maida, and others lying in the mid-sea.\r\nIt may possibly be a fair question if some of the reports of islands\r\nand rocks made within recent times may not have had a foundation in\r\ntemporary uprisings from the bed of the sea.[496] We must in this\r\ncountry depend for the study of this subject on the great collections\r\nof facsimiles of early maps made by Santarem, Kunstmann, Jomard, and on\r\nthe Sammlung which is now in progress at Venice, under the editing of\r\nTheobald Fischer, and published by Ongania.[497]\r\n\r\nWe may place the beginning of the Atlantic cartography[498] in the map\r\nof Marino Sanuto in 1306, who was first of the nautical map-makers of\r\nthat century to lay down the Canaries;[499] but Sanuto was by no means\r\nsure of their existence, if we may judge from his omission of them in\r\nhis later maps.[500]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIFTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nA conventional map of the older period, which is given in Santarem’s\r\n_Atlas_ as a “Mappemonde qui se trouve au revers d’une Médaille du\r\nCommencement du XVe Siècle.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The above maps are reduced a little from the engraving in\r\n_Allgemeine Geographische Ephemeriden_ (Weimar, 1807), vol. xxiv. p.\r\n248. The smaller is an extract from that of Fr. Pizigani (1367), and\r\nthe larger that of Andreas Bianco (1436). There is another fac-simile\r\nof the latter in F. M. Erizzo’s _Le Scoperte Artiche_ (Venice, 1855).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CATALAN MAP, 1375.\r\n\r\nAfter a sketch in St. Martin’s _Atlas_, pl. vii.]\r\n\r\nThere are two maps of Hygden (A.D. 1350), but the abundance of\r\nislands which they present can hardly be said to show more than a\r\ntheory.[501] There is more likelihood of well considered work in the\r\nPortolano Laurenziano-Gaddiano (A.D. 1351), preserved in the Biblioteca\r\nMediceo-Laurenziana at Florence, of which Ongania, of Venice, published\r\na fac-simile in 1881.[502] There are two maps of Francisco Pizigani,\r\nwhich seem to give the Canaries, Madeira, and the Azores better than\r\nany earlier one. One of these maps (1367) is in the national library\r\nat Parma, and the other (1373) is in the Ambrosian library at Milan\r\n(_Studi biog. e bibliog._, vol. ii. pp. viii, 57, 58). The 1367 map\r\nis given by Jomard and Santarem. The most famous of all these early\r\nmaps is the Catalan Mappemonde of 1375, preserved in the great library\r\nat Paris. It gives the Canaries and other islands further north, but\r\ndoes not reach to the Azores.[503] These last islands are included,\r\nhowever, in another Catalan planisphere of not far from the same era,\r\nwhich is preserved in the national library at Florence, and has been\r\nreproduced by Ongania (1881).[504] The student will need to compare\r\nother maps of the fourteenth century, which can be found mentioned in\r\nthe _Studi_, etc., with references in the _Kohl Maps_, sect. 1. The\r\nphototypic series of Ongania is the most important contribution to\r\nthis study, though the yellow tints of the original too often render\r\nthe details obscurely.[505] So for the next century there are the same\r\nguides; but a number of conspicuous charts may well be mentioned. Chief\r\namong them are those of Andrea Bianco contained in the Atlas (1436),\r\nin the Biblioteca Marciana at Venice, published by Ongania (1871), who\r\nalso published (1881) the Carta Nautica of Bianco, in the Biblioteca\r\nAmbrosiana in Milan.[506]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREAS BENINCASA, 1476.\r\n\r\nAfter a sketch in St. Martin’s _Atlas_, pl. vii.]\r\n\r\nThe 1436 map has been reproduced in colors in Pietro Amat de San\r\nFilippo’s _Planisferio disegnato del 1436_ (_Bollettino Soc.\r\nGeografia_, 1879, p. 560); and a sketch of the Atlantic part is given\r\nin the _Allgem. Geog. Ephemeriden_, xxiv. no. 248.[507]\r\n\r\nDuring the next twenty years or more, the varying knowledge of the\r\nAtlantic is shown in a number of maps, a few of which may be named:—The\r\nCatalan map “de Gabriell de Valsequa, faite à Mallorcha en 1439,”\r\nwhich shows the Azores, and which Vespucius is said to have owned\r\n(Santarem, pl. 54). The planisphere “in lingua latina dell’ anno 1447,”\r\nin the national library at Florence (Ongania, 1881). The world maps of\r\nGiovanni Leardo (Johannes Leardus), 1448 and 1452, the former of which\r\nis given in Santarem (pl. 25,—also _Hist. Cartog._ iii. 398), and the\r\nlatter reproduced by Ongania, 1880. One is in the Ambrosian library,\r\nand the other in the Museo Civico at Vicenza (cf. _Studi_, etc., ii.\r\n72, 73). In the Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele at Rome there is the\r\nsea-chart of Bartolomaeus de Pareto of 1455, on which we find laid down\r\nthe Fortunate Islands, St. Brandan’s, Antillia, and Royllo.[508] The\r\nWorld of Fra Mauro[509] has been referred to elsewhere in the present\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAON GLOBE.\r\n\r\nFrom a “projection Synoptique Cordiforme” in the _Bull. de la Soc. de\r\nGéog._, 4e série, xx. (1860), in connection with a paper by D’Avezac\r\n(p. 398). Cf. Oscar Peschel in _Ausland_ May 12, 1861; also in his\r\n_Abhandlungen_, i. 226.]\r\n\r\nWe come now to the conditions of the Atlantic cartography immediately\r\npreceding the voyage of Columbus. The most prominent specimens of this\r\nperiod are the various marine charts of Grogioso and Andreas Benincasa\r\nfrom 1461 to 1490. Some of these are given by Santarem, Lelewel, and\r\nSt. Martin; but the best enumeration of them is given in the _Studi\r\nbiog. e bibliog. della Soc. Geog. Ital._ ii. 66, 77-84, 92, 99, 100.\r\nOf Toscanelli’s map of 1474, which influenced Columbus, we have no\r\nsketch, though some attempts have been made to reconstruct it from\r\ndescriptions. (Cf. Vol. II. p. 103; Harrisse’s _Christophe Colomb._,\r\ni. 127, 129.) Brief mention may also be made of the Laon globe of 1486\r\n(dated 1493), of which D’Avezac gives a projection in the _Bulletin\r\nde la Soc. de Géog._ xx. 417; of the Majorcan (Catalan) Carta nautica\r\nof about 1487 (cf. _Studi_, etc., ii. no. 397; _Bull. Soc. Géog._, i.\r\n295); of the chart in the Egerton MSS., Brit. Mus., made by Christofalo\r\nSoligo about the same time, and which has no dearth of islands (cf.\r\n_Studi_, etc., i. 89); of those of Nicola Fiorin, Canepa, and Giacomo\r\nBertran (_Studi_, etc., ii. 82, 86, and no. 398). The globe of Behaim\r\n(1492) gives the very latest of these ante-Columbian views (see Vol.\r\nII. 105).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Fac-simile from_ BORDONE, 1547.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: END OF FIFTEENTH CENTURY. (Santarem’s _Atlas_.)]\r\n\r\nIt took, after this, a long time for the Atlantic to be cleared, even\r\npartially, of these intrusive islands, and to bring the proper ones\r\ninto accurate relations. How the old ideas survived may be traced in\r\nthe maps of Ruysch, 1508 (Vol. II. 115); Coppo, 1528, with its riot of\r\nislands (II. 127); Mercator, 1541 (II. 177); Bordone, 1547; Zaltière,\r\n1566 (II. 451); Porcacchi, 1572 (II. 453); Ortelius, 1575, 1587,—not to\r\ncontinue the series further.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The left of the annexed cuts is from Bordone’s _Isolario_, 1547;\r\nthe right one is an extract from the “World” of Ortelius, 1587.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPRE-COLUMBIAN EXPLORATIONS.\r\n\r\nBY JUSTIN WINSOR, THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the previous chapter, in attempting to trace the possible connection\r\nof the new world with the old in the dimmest past, it was hard, if\r\nnot hopeless, to find among the entangled myths a path that we could\r\nfollow with any confidence into the field of demonstrable history.\r\nIt is still a doubt how far we exchange myths for assured records,\r\nwhen we enter upon the problems of pre-Columbian explorations, which\r\nit is the object of the present chapter to discuss. We are to deal\r\nwith supposable colonizations, from which the indigenous population\r\nof America, as the Spaniards found it, was sprung, wholly or in part;\r\nand we are to follow the venturesome habits of navigators, who sought\r\nexperience and commerce in a strange country, and only incidentally\r\nleft possible traces of their blood in the peoples they surprised. If\r\nSpain, Italy, and England gained consequence by the discoveries of\r\nColumbus and Cabot, there were other national prides to be gratified\r\nby the priority which the Basques, the Normans, the Welsh, the Irish,\r\nand the Scandinavians, to say nothing of Asiatic peoples, claimed as\r\ntheir share in the gift of a new world to the old. The records which\r\nthese peoples present as evidences of their right to be considered the\r\nforerunners of the Spanish and English expeditions have in every case\r\nbeen questioned by those who are destitute of the sympathetic credence\r\nof a common kinship. The claims which Columbus and Cabot fastened upon\r\nSpain and England, to the disadvantage of Italy, who gave to those\r\nrival countries their maritime leaders, were only too readily rejected\r\nby Italy herself, when the opportunity was given to her of paling such\r\nborrowed glories before the trust which she placed in the stories of\r\nthe Zeni brothers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is not a race of eastern Asia—Siberian, Tartar, Chinese,\r\nJapanese, Malay, with the Polynesians—which has not been claimed\r\nas discoverers, intending or accidental, of American shores, or as\r\nprogenitors, more or less perfect or remote, of American peoples; and\r\nthere is no good reason why any one of them may not have done all that\r\nis claimed. The historical evidence, however, is not such as is based\r\non documentary proofs of indisputable character, and the recitals\r\nadvanced are often far from precise enough to be convincing in details,\r\nif their general authenticity is allowed. Nevertheless, it is much\r\nmore than barely probable that the ice of Behring Straits or the line\r\nof the Aleutian Islands was the pathway of successive immigrations,\r\non occasions perhaps far apart, or may be near together; and there is\r\nhardly a stronger demonstration of such a connection between the two\r\ncontinents than the physical resemblances of the peoples now living\r\non opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean in these upper latitudes, with\r\nthe similarity of the flora which environs them on either shore.[510]\r\nIt is quite as conceivable that the great northern current, setting\r\neast athwart the Pacific, should from time to time have carried along\r\ndisabled vessels, and stranded them on the shores of California and\r\nfarther north, leading to the infusion of Asiatic blood among whatever\r\nthere may have been antecedent or autochthonous in the coast peoples.\r\nIt is certainly in this way possible that the Chinese or Japanese may\r\nhave helped populate the western slopes of the American continent.\r\nThere is no improbability even in the Malays of southeastern Asia\r\nextending step by step to the Polynesian islands, and among them and\r\nbeyond them, till the shores of a new world finally received the\r\nimpress of their footsteps and of their ethnic characteristics. We may\r\nvery likely recognize not proofs, but indications, along the shores of\r\nSouth America, that its original people constituted such a stock, or\r\nwere increased by it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs respects the possible early connections of America on the side of\r\nEurope, there is an equally extensive array of claims, and they have\r\nbeen set forth, first and last, with more persistency than effect.[511]\r\n\r\nLeaving the old world by the northern passage, Iceland lies at the\r\nthreshold of America. It is nearer to Greenland than to Norway, and\r\nGreenland is but one of the large islands into which the arctic\r\ncurrents divide the North American continent. Thither, to Iceland, if\r\nwe identify the localities in Geoffrey of Monmouth, King Arthur sailed\r\nas early as the beginning of the sixth century, and overcame whatever\r\ninhabitants he may have found there. Here too an occasional wandering\r\npirate or adventurous Dane had glimpsed the coast.[512] Thither, among\r\nothers, came the Irish, and in the ninth century we find Irish monks\r\nand a small colony of their countrymen in possession.[513] Thither the\r\nGulf Stream carries the southern driftwood, suggesting sunnier lands\r\nto whatever race had been allured or driven to its shelter.[514] Here\r\nColumbus, when, as he tells us,[515] he visited the island in 1477,\r\nfound no ice. So that, if we may place reliance on the appreciable\r\nchange of climate by the precession of the equinoxes, a thousand years\r\nago and more, when the Norwegians crossed from Scandinavia and found\r\nthese Christian Irish there,[516] the island was not the forbidding\r\nspot that it seems with the lapse of centuries to be becoming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORSE SHIP.\r\n\r\nThis cut is copied from one in Nordenskiöld’s _Voyage of the Vega_\r\n(London, 1881), vol. i. p. 50, where it is given as representing the\r\nvessel found at Sandefjord in 1880. It is drawn from the restoration\r\ngiven in _The Viking ship discovered at Gokstad in Norway (Langskibet\r\nfra Gokstad ved Sandefjord) described by N. Nicholaysen_ (Christiania,\r\n1882). The original vessel owed its preservation to being used as\r\na receptacle for the body of a Viking chief, when he was buried\r\nunder a mound. When exhumed, its form, with the sepulchral chamber\r\nmidships, could be made out, excepting that the prow and stern in their\r\nextremities had to be restored. In the ship and about it were found,\r\nbeside some of the bones of a man, various appurtenances of the vessel,\r\nand the remains of horses buried with him. They are all described in\r\nthe book above cited, from which the other cuts herewith given of the\r\nplan of the vessel and one of its rowlocks are taken. The _Popular\r\nScience Monthly_, May, 1881, borrowing from _La Nature_, gives a view\r\nof the ship as when found _in situ_.

This\r\nis a translation by Mr. Gerhard Gadé of a Report in the Proceedings of\r\nthe Society for preserving Norwegian Antiquities. (Cf. _Mass. Hist.\r\nSoc. Proc._, xiii. p. 10.) This vessel was also buried under a mound,\r\nand she was 43½ feet long and four feet deep.\r\n\r\nThere is in the Nicholaysen volume a detailed account of the naval\r\narchitecture of the Viking period, and other references may be made\r\nto Otto Jorell’s _Les navires des peuples du Nord_, in the _Congrès\r\ninternat. des sciences géog., compte rendu, 1875_ (1878, i. 318);\r\n_Mémoires de la Soc. royal des Antiquaires du Nord_ (1887, p. 280);\r\nPreble, in _United Service_ (May, 1883, p. 463), and in his _Amer.\r\nFlag_, p. 159; De Costa’s _Pre-Columbian Discovery of America_, p.\r\nxxxvii; Fox’s _Landfall of Columbus_, p. 3; _Pop.

Worsaae’s _Prehistory of the North_ (Eng. transl., London,1886)\r\nfor the burial in ships.\r\n\r\nThere is a paper on the daring of the Norsemen as navigators by G.\r\nBrynjalfson (_Compte Rendu, Congrès des Américanistes_, Copenhagen, p.\r\n140), entitled “Jusqu’où les anciens Scandinaves ont-ils pénétré vers\r\nle pôle arctique dans leurs expéditions à la mer glaciale?”\r\n\r\nIt was in A.D. 875 that Ingolf, a jarl[517] of Norway, came to\r\nIceland with Norse settlers. They built their habitation at first where\r\na pleasant headland seemed attractive, the present Ingolfshofdi, and\r\nlater founded Reikjavik, where the signs had directed them; for certain\r\ncarved posts, which they had thrown overboard as they approached\r\nthe island, were found to have drifted to that spot. The Christian\r\nIrish preferred to leave their asylum rather than consort with the\r\nnew-comers, and so the island was left to be occupied by successive\r\nimmigrations of the Norse, which their king could not prevent. In\r\nthe end, and within half a century, a hardy little republic—as for\r\na while it was—of near seventy thousand inhabitants was established\r\nalmost under the arctic circle. The very next year (A.D. 876) after\r\nIngolf had come to Iceland, a sea-rover, Gunnbiorn, driven in his ship\r\nwesterly, sighted a strange land, and the report that he made was not\r\nforgotten.[518] Fifty years later, more or less, for we must treat the\r\ndates of the Icelandic sagas with some reservation, we learn that a\r\nwind-tossed vessel was thrown upon a coast far away, which was called\r\nIreland the Great. Then again we read of a young Norwegian, Eric the\r\nRed, not apparently averse to a brawl, who killed his man in Norway\r\nand fled to Iceland, where he kept his dubious character; and again\r\noutraging the laws, he was sent into temporary banishment,—this time\r\nin a ship which he fitted out for discovery; and so he sailed away\r\nin the direction of Gunnbiorn’s land, and found it. He whiled away\r\nthree years on its coast, and as soon as he was allowed ventured back\r\nwith the tidings, while, to propitiate intending settlers, he said\r\nhe had been to Greenland, and so the land got a sunny name. The next\r\nyear, which seems to have been A.D. 985, he started on his return with\r\nthirty-five ships, but only fourteen of them reached the land. Wherever\r\nthere was a habitable fiord, a settlement grew up, and the stream of\r\nimmigrants was for a while constant and considerable. Just at the end\r\nof the century (A.D. 999), Leif, a son of Eric, sailed back to Norway,\r\nand found the country in the early fervor of a new religion; for King\r\nOlaf Tryggvesson had embraced Christianity and was imposing it on his\r\npeople. Leif accepted the new faith, and a priest was assigned to him\r\nto take back to Greenland; and thus Christianity was introduced into\r\narctic America. So they began to build churches[519] in Greenland, the\r\nconsiderable ruins of one of which stand to this day.[520] The winning\r\nof Iceland to the Church was accomplished at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF VIKING SHIP.]\r\n\r\nThere were two centres of settlement on the Greenland coast, not where\r\nthey were long suspected to be, on the coast opposite Iceland, nor as\r\nsupposed after the explorations of Baffin’s Bay, on both the east and\r\nwest side of the country; but the settlers seem to have reached and\r\ndoubled Cape Farewell, and so formed what was called their eastern\r\nsettlement (Eystribygd), near the cape, while farther to the north they\r\nformed their western colony (Westribygd).[521] Their relative positions\r\nare still involved in doubt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROWLOCK OF THE VIKING SHIP.]\r\n\r\nIn the next year after the second voyage of Eric the Red, one of the\r\nships which were sailing from Iceland to the new settlement, was driven\r\nfar off her course, according to the sagas, and Bjarni Herjulfson, who\r\ncommanded the vessel, reported that he had come upon a land, away to\r\nthe southwest, where the coast country was level; and he added that\r\nwhen he turned north it took him nine days to reach Greenland.[522]\r\nFourteen years later than this voyage of Bjarni, which is said to have\r\nbeen in A.D. 986,—that is, in the year 1000 or thereabouts,—Leif, the\r\nsame who had brought the Christian priest to Greenland, taking with him\r\nthirty-five companions, sailed from Greenland in quest of the land seen\r\nby Bjarni, which Leif first found, where a barren shore stretched back\r\nto ice-covered mountains, and because of the stones there he called the\r\nregion Hellu land. Proceeding farther south, he found a sandy shore,\r\nwith a level forest-country back of it, and because of the woods it was\r\nnamed Markland. Two days later they came upon other land, and tasting\r\nthe dew upon the grass they found it sweet. Farther south and westerly\r\nthey went, and going up a river came into an expanse of water, where\r\non the shores they built huts to lodge in for the winter, and sent\r\nout exploring parties. In one of these, Tyrker, a native of a part of\r\nEurope where grapes grew, found vines hung with their fruit, which\r\ninduced Leif to call the country Vinland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORSE BOAT USED AS A HABITATION.\r\n\r\nFrom Viollet-le-Duc’s _Habitation humaine_ (Paris, 1875).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORMAN SHIP FROM THE BAYEUX TAPESTRY.\r\n\r\nFrom Worsaae’s _Danes and Norwegians in England_, etc. “With the\r\nexception of very imperfect representation carved on rocks and runic\r\nstones [see Higginson’s _Larger History_, p. 27], there are no images\r\nleft in the countries of Scandinavia of ships of the olden times; but\r\nthe tapestry at Bayeux, in Normandy, is a contemporary evidence of the\r\nappearance of the Normanic ships.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCANDINAVIAN FLAGS.\r\n\r\nThis group from Worsaae’s _Danes and Norwegians in England, etc._, p.\r\n64, shows the transition from the raven to the cross.]\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to identify these various regions by the\r\ninexact accounts of the direction of their sailing, by the very general\r\ndescriptions of the country, by the number of days occupied in going\r\nfrom one point to another, with the uncertainty if the ship sailed\r\nat night, and by the length of the shortest day in Vinland,—the last\r\na statement that might help us, if it could be interpreted with a\r\nreasonable concurrence of opinion, and if it were not confused with\r\nother inexplicable statements. The next year Leif’s brother, Thorvald,\r\nwent to Vinland with a single ship, and passed three winters there,\r\nmaking explorations meanwhile, south and north. Thorfinn Karlsefne,\r\narriving in Greenland in A.D. 1006, married a courageous widow named\r\nGudrid, who induced him to sail with his ships to Vinland and make\r\nthere a permanent settlement, taking with him livestock and other\r\nnecessaries for colonization. Their first winter in the place was a\r\nsevere one; but Gudrid gave birth to a son, Snorre, from whom it is\r\nclaimed Thorwaldsen, the Danish sculptor, was descended. The next\r\nseason they removed to the spot where Leif had wintered, and called the\r\nbay Hóp. Having spent a third winter in the country, Karlsefne, with a\r\npart of the colony, returned to Greenland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM OLAUS MAGNUS.\r\n\r\nFac-simile of Norse weapons from the _Historia_ of Olaus Magnus (b.\r\n1490; d. 1568), Rome, 1555, p. 222.]\r\n\r\nThe saga then goes on to say that trading voyages to the settlement\r\nwhich had been formed by Karlsefne now became frequent, and that the\r\nchief lading of the return voyages was timber, which was much needed in\r\nGreenland. A bishop of Greenland, Eric Upsi, is also said to have gone\r\nto Vinland in A.D. 1121. In 1347 the last ship of which we have any\r\nrecord in these sagas went to Vinland after timber. After this all is\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\nThere are in all these narratives many details beyond this outline,\r\nand those who have sought to identify localities have made the most\r\nthey could of the mention of a rock here or a bluff there, of an\r\nisland where they killed a bear, of others where they found eggs, of\r\na headland where they buried a leader who had been killed, of a cape\r\nshaped like a keel, of broadfaced natives who offered furs for red\r\ncloths, of beaches where they hauled up their ships, and of tides that\r\nwere strong; but the more these details are scanned in the different\r\nsagas the more they confuse the investigator, and the more successive\r\nrelators try to enlighten us the more our doubts are strengthened, till\r\nwe end with the conviction that all attempts at consistent unravelment\r\nleave nothing but a vague sense of something somewhere done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULL-SIZE FAC-SIMILE OF THE TABLET, _engraved by Prof.\r\nMagnus Petersen, with the Runes as he sees them_.\r\n\r\n(TRANSLITERATION OF THE LEADEN TABLET.),\r\n\r\n  + (AT) Þ(E)R KUEN(E) SINE PRINSINED (B)AD (M)OTO\r\n  LANANA KRISTI DONAVISTI GARDIAR IARDIAR\r\n  IBODIAR KRISTUS UINKIT KRISTUS REGNAT\r\n  KRISTUS IMPERAT KRISTUS AB OMNI\r\n  MALO ME ASAM LIPERET KRUX KRISTI\r\n  SIT SUPER ME ASAM HIK ET UBIQUE\r\n  + KHORDA + IN KHORDA + KHORDAE\r\n  (t) (M)AGLA + SANGUIS KRISTI SIGNET ME\r\n\r\nRUNES, A.D. 1000.\r\n\r\nThis cut is of some of the oldest runes known, giving two lines in\r\nDanish and the rest in Latin, as the transliteration shows. It is\r\ncopied from _The oldest yet found Document in Danish, by Prof Dr.\r\nGeorge Stephens_ (Copenhagen, 1888,—from the _Mémoires des Antiquaires\r\ndu Nord_, 1887). The author says that the leaden tablet on which the\r\nrunes were cut was found in Odense, Fyn, Denmark, in 1883, and he\r\nplaces the date of it about the year A.D. 1000.\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephens’s _Handbook of the old Northern Runic Monuments of\r\nScandinavia and England_ is a condensation, preserving all the cuts,\r\nand making some additions to his larger folio work in 3 vols., _The\r\nold-northern Runic monuments of Scandinavia and England, now first\r\ncollected and deciphered_ (London, etc., 1866-68). It does not contain\r\neither Icelandic or Greenland runes. He says that by the time of the\r\ncolonization of Iceland “the old northern runes as a system had died\r\nout on the Scandinavian main, and were followed by the later runic\r\nalphabet. But even this modern Icelandic of the tenth century has not\r\ncome down to us. If it had, it would be very different from what is\r\nnow vulgarly so called, which is the greatly altered Icelandic of the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries.... The oldest written Icelandic\r\nknown to us is said to date from about the year 1200.... The whole\r\nmodern doctrine of one uniform Icelandic language all over the immense\r\nnorth in the first one thousand winters after Christ is an impossible\r\nabsurdity.... It is very seldom that any of the Scandinavian runic\r\nstones bear a date.... No Christian runic gravestone is older than the\r\nfourteenth century.”\r\n\r\nOn runes in general, see Mallet, Bohn’s ed., pp. 227, 248, following\r\nthe cut of the Kingektorsoak stone, in Rafn’s _Antiq. Americanæ_;\r\nWilson’s _Prehist. Man_, ii. 88; Wollheim’s _Nat. Lit. der\r\nScandinavier_ (Berlin, 1875), vol. i. pp. 2-15; Legis-Glueckselig’s\r\n_Die Runen and ihre Denkmäler_ (Leipzig, 1829); De Costa’s _Pre-Columb.\r\nDisc._, pp. xxx; _Revue polit. et lit._, Jan. 10, 1880.\r\n\r\nIt is held that runes are an outgrowth of the Latin alphabet. (L. F. A.\r\nWimmer’s _Runeskriftens Oprindelse og Udvikling i norden_, Copenhagen,\r\n1874.)]\r\n\r\nEverywhere else where the Northmen went they left proofs of their\r\noccupation on the soil, but nowhere in America, except on an island\r\non the east shore of Baffin’s Bay,[523] has any authentic runic\r\ninscription been found outside of Greenland. Not a single indisputable\r\ngrave has been discovered to attest their alleged centuries of fitful\r\noccupation. The consistent and natural proof of any occupation of\r\nAmerica south of Davis Straits is therefore lacking; and there is\r\nnot sufficient particularity in the descriptions[524] to remove the\r\nsuspicion that the story-telling of the fireside has overlaid the\r\nreports of the explorer. Our historic sense is accordingly left to\r\nconsider, as respects the most general interpretation, what weight\r\nof confidence should be yielded to the sagas, pre-Columbian as they\r\ndoubtless are. But beyond this is perhaps, what is after all the\r\nmost satisfactory way of solving the problem, a dependence on the\r\ngeographical and ethnical probabilities of the case. The Norsemen\r\nhave passed into credible history as the most hardy and venturesome\r\nof races. That they colonized Iceland and Greenland is indisputable.\r\nThat their eager and daring nature should have deserted them at this\r\npoint is hardly conceivable. Skirting the Greenland shores and inuring\r\nthemselves to the hardships and excitements of northern voyaging,\r\nthere was not a long stretch of open sea before they could strike the\r\nLabrador coast. It was a voyage for which their ships, with courageous\r\ncrews, were not unfitted. Nothing is more likely than that some ship\r\nof theirs may have been blown westerly and unwillingly in the first\r\ninstance, just as Greenland was in like manner first made known to the\r\nIcelanders. The coast once found, to follow it to the south would have\r\nbeen their most consistent action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM OLAUS MAGNUS.\r\n\r\nFac-simile of a cut to the chapter “De Alphabeto Gothorum” in the\r\n_Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus_ (Romæ, M.D.LV.).]\r\n\r\nWe may consider, then, that the weight of probability[525] is in favor\r\nof a Northman descent upon the coast of the American mainland at some\r\npoint, or at several, somewhere to the south of Greenland; but the\r\nevidence is hardly that which attaches to well-established historical\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nThe archæological traces, which are lacking farther south, are\r\nabundant in Greenland, and confirm in the most positive way the Norse\r\noccupation. The ruins of churches and baptisteries give a color of\r\ntruth to the ecclesiastical annals which have come down to us, and\r\nwhich indicate that after having been for more than a century under the\r\nBishop of Iceland, a succession of bishops of its own was established\r\nthere early in the twelfth century. The names of seventeen prelates\r\nare given by Torfæus, though it is not quite certain that the bishops\r\ninvariably visited their see. The last known to have filled the office\r\nwent thither in the early years of the fifteenth century. The last\r\ntrace of him is in the celebration of a marriage at Gardar in 1409.\r\n\r\nThe Greenland colonists were equipped with all the necessities of a\r\npermanent life. They had horses, sheep, and oxen, and beef is said to\r\nhave been a regular article of export to Norway. They had buildings\r\nof stone, of which the remains still exist. They doubtless brought\r\ntimber from the south, and we have in runic records evidence of\r\ntheir explorations far to the north. They maintained as late as the\r\nthirteenth century a regular commercial intercourse with the mother\r\ncountry,[526] but this trade fell into disuse when a royal mandate\r\nconstituted such ventures a monopoly of the throne; and probably\r\nnothing so much conduced to the decadence and final extinction of\r\nthe colonies as this usurped and exclusive trade, which cut off all\r\npersonal or conjoined intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe direct cause of the final extinction of the Greenland colonies is\r\ninvolved in obscurity, though a variety of causes, easily presumable,\r\nwould have been sufficient, when we take into consideration the\r\nmoribund condition into which they naturally fell after commercial\r\nrestriction had put a stop to free intercourse with the home government.\r\n\r\nThe Eskimos are said to have appeared in Greenland about the middle\r\nof the fourteenth century, and to have manifested hostility to such a\r\ndegree that about 1342 the imperilled western colony was abandoned. The\r\neastern colony survived perhaps seventy years longer, or possibly to a\r\nstill later period. We know they had a new bishop in 1387, but before\r\nthe end of that century the voyages to their relief were conducted only\r\nafter long intervals.\r\n\r\nBefore communication was wholly cut off, the attacks of the Skrælings,\r\nand possibly famine and the black death, had carried the struggling\r\ncolonists to the verge of destruction. Bergen, in Norway, upon which\r\nthey depended for succor, had at one time been almost depopulated by\r\nthe same virulent disease, and again had been ravaged by a Hanseatic\r\nfleet. Thus such intercourse as the royal monopoly permitted had\r\nbecome precarious, and the marauding of freebooters, then prevalent in\r\nnorthern waters, still further served to impede the communications,\r\ntill at last they wholly ceased, during the early years of the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been maintained that the closing in of ice-packs was\r\nthe final stroke which extinguished the last hopes of the expiring\r\ncolonists.[527] This view, however, meets with little favor among the\r\nmore enlightened students of climatic changes, like Humboldt.[528]\r\n\r\nThere has been published what purports to be a bull of Pope Nicholas\r\nV,[529] directing the Bishop of Iceland to learn what he could of the\r\ncondition of the Greenland colonies, and in this document it is stated\r\nthat part of the colonists had been destroyed by barbarians thirty\r\nyears before,—the bull bearing date in 1448. There is no record that\r\nany expedition followed upon this urging, and there is some question\r\nas to the authenticity of the document.[530] In the _Relation_ of La\r\nPeyrère there is a story of some sailors visiting Greenland so late as\r\n1484; but it is open to question.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEarly in the sixteenth century fitful efforts to learn the fate of\r\nthe colonies began, and these were continued, without result, well\r\ninto the seventeenth century; but nothing explicable was ascertained\r\ntill, in 1721, Hans Egede, a Norwegian priest, prevailed upon the\r\nDanish government to send him on a mission to the Eskimos. He went,\r\naccompanied by wife and children; and the colony of Godthaab, and\r\nthe later history of the missions, and the revival of trade with\r\nEurope, attest the constancy of his purpose and the fruits of his\r\nearnestness. In a year he began to report upon certain remains which\r\nindicated the former occupation of the country by people who built\r\nsuch buildings as was the habit in Europe. He and his son Paul Egede,\r\nand their successors in the missions, gathered for us, first among\r\nmodern searchers, the threads of the history of this former people;\r\nand, as time went on, the researches of Graah, Nordenskjöld, and\r\nother explorers, and the studious habits of Major, Rink, and the rest\r\namong the investigators, have enabled us to read the old sagas of the\r\ncolonization of Greenland with renewed interest and with the light of\r\ncorroborating evidence.[531]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nDEI COMMENTARII DEL\r\n\r\nViaggio in Persia di M.

Leaving here 120 persons, he returned to\r\nWales, and fitted out a larger expedition of ten ships, with which he\r\nagain sailed, and passed out of view forever. The evidence in support\r\nof this story is that it is mentioned in early annals, and that\r\nsundry persons have discovered traces of the Welsh tongue among the\r\nlighter-colored American Indians, to say nothing of manifold legends\r\namong the Indians of an original people, white in color, coming from\r\nafar towards the northeast,—proofs not sufficient to attract the\r\nconfidence of those who look for historical tests, though, as Humboldt\r\ncontends,[532] there may be no impossibility in the story.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a general agreement that a crew of Arabs, somewhere\r\nabout the eleventh or twelfth century, explored the Atlantic westward,\r\nwith the adventurous purpose of finding its further limits, and that\r\nthey reached land, which may have been the Canaries, or possibly the\r\nAzores, though the theory that they succeeded in reaching America is\r\nnot without advocates. The main source of the belief is the historical\r\ntreatise of the Arab geographer Edrisi, whose work was composed about\r\nthe middle of the twelfth century.[533]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIP OF THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Isolario_ (Venice, 1547).]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the fourteenth century,[534] as the story goes,\r\ntwo brothers of Venice, Nicolo and Antonio Zeno, being on a voyage\r\nin the North Atlantic were wrecked there, and lived for some years\r\nat Frislanda, and visited Engroneland. During this northern sojourn\r\nthey encountered a sailor, who, after twenty-six years of absence, had\r\nreturned, and reported that the ship in which he was had been driven\r\nwest in a gale to an island, where he found civilized people, who\r\npossessed books in Latin and could not speak Norse, and whose country\r\nwas called Estotiland; while a region on the mainland, farther south,\r\nto which he had also gone, was called Drogeo, and that here he had\r\nencountered cannibals. Still farther south was a great country with\r\ntowns and temples. This information, picked up by these exiled Zeni,\r\nwas finally conveyed to another brother in Venice, accompanied by a map\r\nof these distant regions. These documents long remained in the family\r\npalace in Venice, and were finally neglected and became obscured, until\r\nat last a descendant of the family compiled from them, as best he\r\ncould, a book, which was printed in Venice in 1558 as _Dei Commentarii\r\ndel Viaggio_, which was accompanied by a map drawn with difficulty from\r\nthe half obliterated original which had been sent from Frislanda.[535]\r\nThe original documents were never produced, and the publication took\r\nplace opportunely to satisfy current curiosity, continually incited\r\nby the Spanish discoveries. It was also calculated to appeal to the\r\nnational pride of Italy, which had seen Spain gain the glory of her own\r\nsons, Columbus and Vespucius, if it could be established that these\r\ndistant regions, of which the Zeni brothers so early reported tidings,\r\nwere really the great new world.[536] The cartography of the sixteenth\r\ncentury shows that the narrative and its accompanying map made an\r\nimpression on the public mind, but from that day to this it has been\r\napparent that there can be no concurrence of opinion as to what island\r\nthe Frislanda of the Zeni was, if it existed at all except in some\r\ndisordered or audacious mind; and, as a matter of course, the distant\r\nregions of Estotiland and Drogeo have been equally the subject of\r\nbelief and derision. No one can be said wholly to have taken the story\r\nout of the category of the uncertain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SEA OF DARKNESS. (From Olaus Magnus.)]\r\n\r\nThe presence of the Basques on the coasts of North America long\r\nbefore the voyage of Columbus is often asserted,[537] and there is\r\nno improbability in a daring race of seamen, in search of whales,\r\nfinding a way to the American waters. There are some indications\r\nin the early cartography which can perhaps be easily explained\r\non this hypothesis;[538] there are said to be unusual linguistic\r\ncorrespondences in the American tongues with those of this strange\r\npeople.[539] There are the reports of the earliest navigators, who have\r\nleft indisputable records that earlier visitors from Europe had been\r\nbefore them, and Cabot may have found some reminders of such;[540] and\r\nit is even asserted that it was a Basque mariner, who had been on the\r\nNewfoundland banks, and gave to Columbus some premonitions of the New\r\nWorld.[541]\r\n\r\nCertain claims of the Dutch have also been advanced;[542] and one for\r\nan early discovery of Newfoundland, in 1463-64, by John Vas Costa\r\nCortereal was set forth by Barrow in his _Chronological Hist. of\r\nVoyages into the Arctic Regions_ (London, 1818); but he stands almost\r\nalone in his belief.[543] Biddle in his _Cabot_ has shown its great\r\nimprobability.\r\n\r\nIn the years while Columbus was nourishing his purpose of a western\r\nvoyage, there were two adventurous navigators, as alleged, who were\r\nbreasting the dangers of the Sea of Darkness both to the north and\r\nto the south. It cannot be said that either the Pole Skolno, in his\r\nskirting the Labrador coasts in 1476,[544] or the Norman Cousin, who\r\nis thought to have traversed a part of the South American coast in\r\n1488-89,[545] have passed with their exploits into the accepted truths\r\nof history; but there was nothing improbable in what was said of them,\r\nand they flourish as counter-rumors always survive when attendant upon\r\nsome great revelation like that of Columbus.\r\n\r\nCRITICAL NOTES ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.\r\n\r\n=A.= EARLY CONNECTION OF ASIATIC PEOPLES WITH THE WESTERN COAST OF\r\nAMERICA.— The question of the origin of the Americans, whether an\r\nautochthonous one or associated with the continents beyond either\r\nocean, is more properly discussed in another place of the present\r\nvolume. We can only indicate here in brief such of the phases of the\r\nquestion as suppose an Asiatic connection, and the particular lines of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nThe ethnic unity of the American races, as urged by Morton and others,\r\nhardly meets the requirements of the problem in the opinion of most\r\nlater students, like Sir Daniel Wilson, for instance; and yet, if A.\r\nH. Keane represents, as he claims, the latest ethnological beliefs,\r\nthe connection with Asia, of the kind that forms ethnic traces, must\r\nhave been before the history of the present Asiatic races, since the\r\ncorrespondence of customs, etc. is not sufficient for more recent\r\naffiliation.[546] It should be remembered also, that if this is true,\r\nand if there is the strong physical resemblance between Asiatics and\r\nthe indigenous tribes of the northwest coast which early travellers and\r\nphysiologists have dwelt on, we have in such a correspondence strong\r\nevidence of the persistency of types.[547]\r\n\r\nThe Asiatic theory was long a favorite one. So popular a book as\r\nLafitau’s _Mœurs des Sauvages_ (Paris, 1724) advocated it. J. B.\r\nScherer’s _Recherches historiques et géographiques sur le nouveau\r\nmonde_ (Paris, 1777) was on the same side. One of the earliest in this\r\ncountry, Benj. Smith Barton, to give expression to American scholarship\r\nin this field held like opinions in his _New Views of the Origin of\r\nthe Tribes of America_ (Philad., 1797).[548] Twenty years later (1816)\r\none of the most active of the American men of letters advocated the\r\nsame views,—Samuel L. Mitchell in the _Archæologia Americana_ (i. 325,\r\n338, 346). The weightiest authority of his time, Alex. von Humboldt,\r\nformulated his belief in several of his books: _Vues des Cordillères;\r\nAnsichten der Natur; Cosmos_.[549]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEHRING SEA AND ADJACENT WATERS\r\n\r\nNOTE.—Sketch map from the _U. S. Geodetic Survey_, 1880, App. xvi; also\r\nin _Journal Amer. Geog. Soc._, xv. p. 114. Cf. Bancroft’s _Nat. Races_,\r\ni. 35.]\r\n\r\nOf the northern routes, that by Behring’s Straits is the most\r\napparent, and Lyell says that when half-way over Dover Straits, which\r\nhave not far from the same dimensions, he saw both the English and\r\nFrench shores at the same time, he was easily convinced that the\r\npassage by Behring’s Straits solved many of the difficulties of the\r\nAmerican problem.[550]\r\n\r\nThe problem as to the passage by the Aleutian Islands is converted into\r\nthe question whether primitive people could have successfully crossed\r\nan interval from Asia of 130 miles to reach the island Miedna, 126\r\nmore to Behring’s Island, and then 235 to Attu, the westernmost of the\r\nAleutian Islands, or nearly 500 miles in all, and to have crossed in\r\nsuch numbers as to affect the peopling of the new continent. There are\r\nsome, like Winchell, who see no difficulty in the case.[551] There are\r\nno authenticated relics, it is believed, to prove the Tartar occupancy\r\nof the northwest of America.[552] That there have been occasional\r\nestrays upon the coasts of British Columbia, Oregon, and California, by\r\nthe drifting thither of Chinese and Japanese junks, is certainly to be\r\nbelieved; but the argument against their crews peopling the country is\r\nusually based upon the probable absence of women in them,—an argument\r\nthat certainly does not invalidate the belief in an infusion of Asiatic\r\nblood in a previous race.[553]\r\n\r\nThe easterly passage which has elicited most interest is one alleged\r\nto have been made by some Buddhist priests to a country called Fusang,\r\nand in proof of it there is cited the narrative of one Hœi-Shin, who\r\nis reported to have returned to China in A.D. 499. Beside much in the\r\nstory that is ridiculous and impossible, there are certain features\r\nwhich have led some commentators to believe that the coast of Mexico\r\nwas intended, and that the Mexican maguey plant was the tree fusang,\r\nafter which the country is said to have been called. The story was\r\nfirst brought to the attention of Europeans in 1761, when De Guignes\r\npublished his paper on the subject in the 28th volume (pp. 505-26) of\r\nthe Academy of Inscriptions.[554] It seems to have attracted little\r\nattention till J. H. von Klaproth, in 1831, discredited the American\r\ntheory in his “Recherches sur le pays de Fousang,” published in the\r\n_Nouvelles Annales des Voyages_ (2d ser., vol. xxi.), accompanied by a\r\nchart. In 1834 there appeared at Paris a French translation, _Annales\r\ndes Empereurs du Japon_ (_Nipon o dai itsi rau_), to which (vol. iv.)\r\nKlaproth appended an “Aperçu de l’histoire mythologique du Japon,” in\r\nwhich he returned to the subject, and convinced Humboldt at least,[555]\r\nthat the country visited was Japan, and not Mexico, though he could but\r\nsee striking analogies, as he thought, in the Mexican myths and customs\r\nto those of the Chinese.[556]\r\n\r\nIn 1841, Karl Friedrich Neumann, in the _Zeitschrift für allgemeine\r\nErdkunde_ (new series, vol. xvi.), published a paper on “Ost Asien und\r\nWest Amerika nach Chinesischen Quellen aus dem fünften, sechsten und\r\nsiebenten Jahrhundert,” in which he gave a version of the Hœi-shin\r\n(Hœi-schin, Hui-shën) narrative, which Chas. G. Leland, considering\r\nit a more perfect form of the original than that given by De Guignes,\r\ntranslated into English in _The Knickerbocker Mag._ (1850), xxxvi. 301,\r\nas “California and Mexico in the fifth century.”[557]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARTE DES TERRES NOUVELLEMENT CONNUES AU NORD DE LA MER\r\nDU SUD\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The map of Buache, 1752, showing De Guignes’ route of the\r\nChinese emigration to Fusang. Reduced from the copy in the _Congrès\r\ninternationale des Américanistes, Compte Rendu, Nancy, 1875_.]\r\n\r\nThe next to discuss the question, and in an affirmative spirit,\r\nwas Charles Hippolyte de Paravey, in the _Annales de Philosophie\r\nChrétienne_ (Feb., 1844), whose paper was published separately as\r\n_L’Amérique sous le nom de pays de Fou-Sang, est elle citée dès le\r\n5^e siècle de notre ère, dans les grandes annales de la Chine_, etc.\r\n_Discussion ou dissertation abrégée, où l’affirmative est prouvée_\r\n(Paris, 1844); and in 1847 he published _Nouvelles preuves que le pays\r\ndu Fousang est l’Amérique_.[558]\r\n\r\nThe controversy as between De Guignes and Klaproth was shared, in 1862,\r\nby Gustave d’Eichthal, taking the Frenchman’s side, in the _Revue\r\nArchéologique_ (vol. ii.), and finally in his _Etudes sur les origines\r\nBouddhiques de la civilisation Américaine_ (Paris, 1865).[559]\r\n\r\nIn 1870, E. Bretschneider, in his “Fusang, or who discovered America?”\r\nin the _Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal_ (Foochow, Oct.,\r\n1870), contended that the whole story was the fabrication of a lying\r\npriest.[560]\r\n\r\nIn 1875 there was new activity in discussing the question. Two French\r\nwriters of considerable repute in such studies attracted attention: the\r\none, Lucien Adam, in the Congrès des Américanistes at Nancy (_Compte\r\nRendu_, i. 145); and the other, Léon de Rosny, entered the discussions\r\nat the same session (_Ibid._ i. p. 131).[561]\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous study for the English reader was Charles Godfrey\r\nLeland’s _Fusang, or The discovery of America by Chinese Buddhist\r\npriests in the fifth century_ (London, 1875).[562]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis d’Hervey de Saint Denis published in the _Actes de la Soc.\r\nd’Ethnographie_ (1869), vol. vi., and later in the _Comptes Rendus_\r\nof the French Academy of Inscriptions, a _Mémoire sur le pays connu\r\ndes anciens Chinois sous le nom de Fousang, et sur quelques documents\r\ninédits pour servir à l’identifier_, which was afterwards published\r\nseparately in Paris, 1876, in which he assented to the American\r\ntheory. The student of the subject need hardly go, however, beyond E.\r\nP. Vining’s _An inglorious Columbus: or, Evidence that Hwui Shăn and\r\na party of Buddhist monks from Afghanistan discovered America in the\r\nfifth century_ A.D. (New York, 1885), since the compiler has made it a\r\nrepository of all the essential contributions to the question from De\r\nGuignes down. He gives the geographical reasons for believing Fusang to\r\nbe Mexico (ch. 20), comparing the original description of Fusang with\r\nthe early accounts of aboriginal Mexico, and rehearsing the traditions,\r\nas is claimed, of the Buddhists still found by the Spaniards pervading\r\nthe memories of the natives, and at last (ch. 37) summarizing all the\r\ngrounds of his belief.[563]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the Polynesian route as a possible avenue\r\nfor peopling America involves the relations of the Malays to the\r\ninhabitants of the Oceanic Islands and the capacity of early man to\r\ntraverse long distances by water.[564]\r\n\r\nE. B. Tylor has pointed out the Asiatic relations of the Polynesians\r\nin the _Journal of the Anthropological Inst._, xi. 401. Pickering,\r\nin the ethnological chart accompanying the reports of the Wilkes\r\nExpedition, makes the original people of Chili and Peru to be Malay,\r\nand he connects the Californians with the Polynesians.[565]\r\n\r\nThe earliest elaboration of this theory was in John Dunmore Lang’s\r\n_View of the origin and migrations of the Polynesian nations,\r\ndemonstrating their ancient discovery and progressive settlement of the\r\ncontinent of America_ (London, 1834; 2d ed., Sydney, 1877). /Francis\r\nA. Allen has advanced similar views at the meetings of the Congrès des\r\nAméricanistes at Luxembourg and at Copenhagen.[566]\r\n\r\nThe Mongol theory of the occupation of Peru, which John Ranking so\r\nenthusiastically pressed in his _Historical researches on the conquest\r\nof Peru, Mexico, Bogota, Natchez, and Talomeco, in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, by the Mongols, accompanied with elephants; and the local\r\nagreement of history and tradition, with the remains of elephants and\r\nmastodontes found in the new world_ [etc.] (London, 1827), implies\r\nthat in the thirteenth century the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan sent a\r\nfleet against Japan, which, being scattered in a storm, finally in part\r\nreached the coasts of Peru, where the son of Kublai Khan became the\r\nfirst Inca.[567] The book hardly takes rank as a sensible contribution\r\nto ethnology, and Prescott says of it that it embodies “many curious\r\ndetails of Oriental history and manners in support of a whimsical\r\ntheory.”[568]\r\n\r\n\r\n=B.= IRELAND THE GREAT, OR WHITE MAN’S LAND.—The claims of the Irish\r\nto have preceded the Norse in Iceland, and to have discovered America,\r\nrest on an Icelandic saga, which represents that in the tenth century\r\nAre Marson, driven off his course by a gale, found a land which became\r\nknown as Huitramannaland, or white man’s land, or otherwise as Irland\r\nit Mikla.[569] This region was supposed by the colonists of Vinland\r\nto lie farther south, which Rafn[570] interprets as being along the\r\nCarolina coast,[571] and others have put it elsewhere, as Beauvois in\r\nCanada above the Great Lakes; and still others see no more in it than\r\nthe pressing of some storm-driven vessel to the Azores[572] or some\r\nother Atlantic island. The story is also coupled, from another source,\r\nwith the romance of Bjarni Asbrandson, who sailed away from Iceland\r\nand from a woman he loved, because the husband and relatives of the\r\nwoman made it desirable that he should. Thirty years later, the crew of\r\nanother ship, wrecked on a distant coast,[573] found that the people\r\nwho took them prisoners spoke Irish,[574] and that their chieftain\r\nwas this same renegade, who let them go apparently for the purpose of\r\nconveying some token by which he would be remembered to the Thurid\r\nof his dreams. Of course all theorists who have to deal with these\r\nsupposed early discoveries by Europeans connect, each with his own pet\r\nscheme, the prevailing legendary belief among the American Indians that\r\nwhite men at an early period made their appearance on the coasts all\r\nthe way from Central America to Labrador.[575] Whether these strange\r\ncomers be St. Patrick,[576] St. Brandan even, or some other Hibernian\r\nhero, with his followers, is easily to be adduced, if the disposing\r\nmind is inclined.\r\n\r\nThere have been of late years two considerable attempts to establish\r\nthe historical verity of some of these alleged Irish visits.[577]\r\n\r\n\r\n=C.= THE NORSE IN ICELAND.—The chief original source for the Norse\r\nsettlement of Iceland is the famous _Landnamabók_,[578] which is a\r\nrecord by various writers, at different times, of the partitioning and\r\nownership of lands during the earliest years of occupation.[579] This\r\nand other contemporary manuscripts, including the _Heimskringla_ of\r\nSnorre Sturleson and the great body of Icelandic sagas, either at first\r\nhand or as filtered through the leading writers on Icelandic history,\r\nconstitute the material out of which is made up the history of Iceland,\r\nin the days when it was sending its adventurous spirits to Greenland\r\nand probably to the American main.[580]\r\n\r\nRespecting the body of the sagas, Laing (_Heimskringla_, i. 23) says:\r\n“It does not appear that any saga manuscript now existing has been\r\nwritten before the fourteenth century, however old the saga itself may\r\nbe. It is known that in the twelfth century, Are Frode, Sæmund and\r\nothers began to take the sagas out of the traditionary state and fix\r\nthem in writing; but none of the original skins appear to have come\r\ndown to our time, but only some of the numerous copies of them.” Laing\r\n(p. 24) also instances numerous sagas known to have existed, but they\r\nare not now recognized;[581] and he gives us (p. 30) the substance of\r\nwhat is known respecting the writers and transcribers of this early\r\nsaga literature. It is held that by the beginning of the thirteenth\r\ncentury the sagas of the discoveries and settlements had all been put\r\nin writing, and thus the history, as it exists, of mediæval Iceland is,\r\nas Burton says (_Ultima Thule_, i. 237), more complete than that of any\r\nEuropean country.[582]\r\n\r\nAmong the secondary writers, using either at first or second hand the\r\nearly MS. sources, the following may be mentioned:—\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest brought to the attention of the English public\r\nwas _A Compendious Hist. of the Goths, Swedes and Vandals, and other\r\nnorthern powers_ (London, 1650 and 1658), translated in an abridged\r\nform from the Latin of Olaus Magnus, which had been for more than a\r\nhundred years the leading comprehensive authority on the northern\r\nnations. The _Svearikes Historia_ (Stockholm, 1746-62) of Olof von\r\nDalin and the similar work of Sven Lagerbring (1769-1788), covering\r\nthe early history of the north, are of interest for the comparative\r\nstudy of the north, rather than as elucidating the history of Iceland\r\nin particular.[583] More direct aid will be got from Mallet’s _Northern\r\nAntiquities_ (London edition, 1847) and from Wheaton’s _Northmen_. More\r\nspecial is the _Histoire de l’Island_ of Xavier Marmier; and the German\r\nhistorian F. C. Dahlman also touches Iceland with particular attention\r\nin his _Geschichte von Dänemark bis zur Reformation, mit Inbegriff von\r\nNorwegen und Island_ (Hamburg, 1840-43).\r\n\r\nA history of more importance than any other yet published, and of the\r\nwidest scope, was that of Sweden by E. J. Geijer (continued by F. F.\r\nCarlson), which for the early period (down to 1654) is accessible in\r\nEnglish in a translation by J. H. Turner (London, 1845).[584]\r\n\r\nProminent among the later school of northern historians, all touching\r\nthe Icelandic annals more or less, have been Peter Andreas Munch in his\r\n_Det Norske Folks Historie_ (Christiania, 1852-63);[585] N. M. Petersen\r\nin his _Danmarks Historie i Hedenold_ (Copenhagen, 1854-55); K. Keyser\r\nin his _Norges Historie_ (Christiania, 1866-67); J. E. Sars in his\r\n_Udsigt over den Norske Historie_ (Christiania, 1873-77); but all are\r\nsurpassed by Konrad Maurer’s _Island von seiner ersten Entdeckung\r\nbis zum Untergange des Freistaates_,—A.D. 800-1262 (Munich, 1874),\r\npublished as commemorating the thousandth anniversary of the settlement\r\nof Iceland, and it has the repute of being the best book on early\r\nIcelandic history.[586]\r\n\r\nThe change from Paganism to Christianity necessarily enters into all\r\nthe histories covering the tenth and eleventh centuries; but it has\r\nspecial treatment in C. Merivale’s _Conversion of the Northern Nations_\r\n(Boyle lectures,—London, 1866).[587]\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable body of the later literature upon Iceland,\r\nretrospective in character, and affording the results of study more or\r\nless patient as to the life in the early Norse days in Iceland.[588]\r\n\r\nG.W. Dasent’s introduction to his _Story of Burnt Njal_ (Edinburgh,\r\n1861)[589] and his _Norsemen in Iceland_ (Oxford Essays, 1858) give\r\nwhat Max Müller (_Chips from a German Workshop_, ii. 191) calls “a\r\nvigorous and lively sketch of primitive northern life;” and are well\r\nsupplemented by Sabine Baring-Gould’s _Iceland, its scenes and sagas_\r\n(London, 1863 and later), and Richard F. Burton’s _Ultima Thule, with\r\nan historical introduction_ (London, 1875).[590]\r\n\r\n\r\n=D.= GREENLAND AND ITS RUINS.—The sagas still serve us for the\r\ncolonization of Greenland, and of particular use is that of Eric the\r\nRed.[591] The earliest to use these sources in the historic spirit\r\nwas Torfæus in his _Historia Gronlandiæ Antiquæ_ (1715).[592] The\r\nnatural successor of Torfæus and the book upon which later writers\r\nmostly depend is David Crantz’s _Historie von Grönland, enthaltend die\r\nBeschreibung des Landes und der Einwohner, insbesonders die Geschichten\r\nder dortigen Mission. Nebst Fortsetzung_ (Barby, 1765-70, 3 vols.). An\r\nEnglish translation appeared in London in 1767, and again, though in an\r\nabridged form with some changes, in 1820.[593]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF THE CHURCH AT KATORTOK.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in Nordenskjöld’s _Den Andra Dicksonska Expeditionen till\r\nGrönland_, p. 369, following one in _Efter Meddelelser om Grönland_.]\r\n\r\nCrantz says of his own historic aims, referring to Torfæus and to the\r\naccounts given by the Eskimos of the east coast, that he has tried\r\nto investigate “where the savage inhabitants came from, and how the\r\nancient Norwegian inhabitants came to be so totally extirpated,” while\r\nat the same time he looks upon the history of the Moravian missions as\r\nhis chiefest theme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe principal source for the identification of the ruins of Greenland\r\nis the work compiled by Rafn and Finn Magnusen, _Grönlands Historiske\r\nMindesmærker_,[594] with original texts and Danish versions. Useful\r\nsummaries and observations will be found in the paper by K. Steenstrup\r\non “Old Scandinavian ruins in South Greenland” in the _Compte Rendu,\r\nCongrès des Américanistes_ (Copenhagen, 1883, p. 108), and in one\r\non “Les Voyages des Danois au Greenland” in the same (p. 196).\r\nSteenstrup’s paper is accompanied by photographs and cuts, and a map\r\nmarking the site of the ruins. The latest account of them is by Lieut.\r\nHolm in the _Meddelelser om Grönland_ (Copenhagen, 1883), vol. vi.\r\nOther views and plans showing the arrangement of their dwellings and\r\nthe curious circular ruins,[595] which seems to have usually been\r\nnear their churches, are shown in the Baron Nordenskjöld’s _Den andra\r\ndicksonska expeditionen till Grönland, dess inre isöken och dess\r\nostkust, utförd år 1883_ (Stockholm, 1885), the result of the ripest\r\nstudy and closest contact.\r\n\r\nWe need also to scan the narratives of Hans Egede and Graah. Parry\r\nfound in 1824, on an island on the Baltic coast, a runic stone,\r\ncommemorating the occupancy of the spot in 1135 (_Antiquitates\r\nAmericanæ_; Mallet’s _Northern Antiquities_, 248); and in 1830 and 1831\r\nother runes were found on old gravestones (Rink’s _Danish Greenland_,\r\napp. v.; Laing’s _Heimskringla_, i. 151). These last are in the Museum\r\nat Copenhagen. Most of these imperishable relics have been found in the\r\ndistrict of Julianeshaab.[596]\r\n\r\n\r\n=E.= THE VINLAND VOYAGES.—What Leif and Karlsefne knew they\r\nexperienced, and what the sagas tell us they underwent, must have just\r\nthe difference between a crisp narrative of personal adventure and the\r\noft-repeated and embellished story of a fireside narrator, since the\r\ntraditions of the Norse voyages were not put in the shape of records\r\ntill about two centuries had elapsed, and we have no earlier manuscript\r\nof such a record than one made nearly two hundred years later still. It\r\nis indeed claimed that the transmission by tradition in those days was\r\na different matter in respect to constancy and exactness from what it\r\nhas been known to be in later times; but the assumption lacks proof and\r\nmilitates against well-known and inevitable processes of the human mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAGA MANUSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nThis is a portion of one of the plates in the _Antiquitates Americanæ_,\r\ngiven by Rafn to Charles Sumner, with a key in manuscript by Rafn\r\nhimself. His signature is from a copy of his _Mémoire_ given by him to\r\nEdward Everett, and now in Harvard College library.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the credibility of the sagas, the northern writers\r\nrecognize the change which came over the oral traditionary chronicles\r\nwhen the romancing spirit was introduced from the more southern\r\ncountries, at a time while the copies of the sagas which we now have\r\nwere making, after having been for so long a time orally handed\r\ndown; but they are not so successful in making plain what influence\r\nthis imported spirit had on particular sagas, which we are asked to\r\nreceive as historical records. They seem sometimes to forget that it\r\nis not necessary to have culture, heroes, and impossible occurrences\r\nto constitute a myth. A blending of history and myth prompts Horn\r\nto say “that some of the sagas were doubtless originally based on\r\nfacts, but the telling and re-telling have changed them into pure\r\nmyths.” The unsympathetic stranger sees this in stories that the\r\npatriotic Scandinavians are over-anxious to make appear as genuine\r\nchronicles.[597] It is certainly unfortunate that the period of\r\nrecording the older sagas coincides mainly with the age of this\r\nsouthern romancing influence.[598] It is a somewhat anomalous condition\r\nwhen long-transmitted oral stories are assigned to history, and certain\r\nother written ones of the age of the recorded sagas are relegated to\r\nmyth. If we would believe some of the northern writers, what appears\r\nto be difference in kind of embellishment was in reality the sign that\r\nseparated history from fable.[599] Of the interpreters of this olden\r\nlore, Torfæus has been long looked upon as a characteristic exemplar,\r\nand Horn[600] says of his works that they are “perceptibly lacking\r\nin criticism. Torfæus was upon the whole incapable of distinguishing\r\nbetween myth and history.”[601]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUIN AT KATORTOK.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in Nordenskjöld’s _Exped. till Grönland_, p. 371, following\r\nthe _Meddel. om Grönland_, vi. 98.]\r\n\r\nErasmus Rask, in writing to Wheaton in\r\n\r\n\r\n1831,[602] enumerates eight of the early manuscripts which mention\r\nVinland and the voyages; but Rafn, in 1837, counted eighteen such\r\nmanuscripts.[603] We know little or nothing about the recorders or date\r\nof any of these copies, excepting the _Heimskringla_,[604] nor how long\r\nthey had existed orally. Some of them were doubtless put into writing\r\nsoon after the time when such recording was introduced, and this date\r\nis sometimes put as early as A.D. 1120, and sometimes as late as the\r\nmiddle or even end of that century. Meanwhile, Adam of Bremen, in the\r\nlatter part of the eleventh century (A.D. 1073), prepared his _Historia\r\nEcclesiastica_, an account of the spread of Christianity in the north,\r\nin which he says he was told by the Danish king that his subjects\r\nhad found a country to the west, called Winland.[605] A reference is\r\nalso supposed to be made in the _Historia Ecclesiastica_ of Ordericus\r\nVitalis, written about the middle (say A.D. 1140) of the twelfth\r\ncentury. But it was not until somewhere between A.D. 1385 and 1400 that\r\nthe oldest Icelandic manuscript which exists, touching the voyages,\r\nwas compiled,—the so-called _Codex Flatoyensis_,[606] though how much\r\nearlier copies of it were made is not known. It is in this manuscript\r\nthat we find the saga of Olaf Tryggvesson,[607] wherein the voyages\r\nof Leif Ericson are described, and it is only by a comparison of\r\ncircumstances detailed here and in other sagas that the year A.D. 1000\r\nhas been approximately determined as the date.[608] In this same codex\r\nwe find the saga of Eric the Red, one of the chief narratives depended\r\nupon by the advocates of the Norse discovery, and in Rask’s judgment\r\nit “appears to be somewhat fabulous, written long after the event, and\r\ntaken from tradition.”[609]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n_Environs of_ Julianehaab THE ÖSTER BYGD _or_ Eastern Settlement\r\n\r\nReference: _Norse ruins or traces of them_\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The above is a reproduction of a corner map in the map of _Danish\r\nGreenland_ given in Rink’s book of that name. The sea in the southwest\r\ncorner of the cut is not shaded; but shading is given to the interior\r\nice field on the northern and northeastern part of the map. Rink gives\r\na similar map of the Westerbygd.]\r\n\r\nThe other principal saga is that of Thorfinn Karlsefne, which with\r\nsome differences and with the same lack of authenticity, goes over the\r\nground covered by that of Eric the Red.[610]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAFN.]\r\n\r\nOf all the early manuscripts, the well-known _Heimskringla_ of Snorro\r\nSturleson (b. 1178; d. 1241), purporting to be a history of the Norse\r\nkings down to A.D. 1177, is the most entitled to be received as an\r\nhistorical record, and all that it says is in these words: “Leif also\r\nfound Vinland the Good.”[611]\r\n\r\nSaxo Grammaticus (d. about 1208) in his _Historia Danica_ begins with\r\nmyths, and evidently follows the sagas, but does not refer to them\r\nexcept in his preface.[612]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nHISTORIA VINLANDIÆ ANTIQVÆ. seu Partis Americæ Septentrionalis, ubi\r\nNominis ratio recensetur, situs terræ ex dierumbrumalium spatio\r\nexpenditur, soli fertilitas & incolarum barbaries, peregrinorum\r\ntemporarius incolatus & gesta, vicinarum terrarum nomina & facies ex\r\nAntiqvitibus Islandicis in lucem producta exponuntur per THORMODUM\r\nTORFÆUM Rerum Norvegicarum Historiographum Regium.\r\n\r\nHAVNIÆ, Ex Typographéo Regiæ Majest, & Universit, 1705. Impensis\r\nAuthoris. ]\r\n\r\nFor about five hundred years after this the stories attracted little or\r\nno attention.[613] We have seen that Peringskiöld produced these sagas\r\nin 1697. Montanus in his _Nieuwe en onbekende Weereld_ (Amsterdam,\r\n1671), and Campanius, in 1702, in his _Kort Beskrifning om Provincien\r\nNya Swerige uti America_ (Stockholm),[614] gave some details. The\r\naccount which did most, however, to revive an interest in the subject\r\nwas that of Torfæus in his _Historia Vinlandiæ Antiquæ_ (Copenhagen,\r\n1705), but he was quite content to place the scene of his narrative\r\nin America, without attempting to identify localities.[615] The\r\nvoyages were, a few years later, the subject of a dissertation at\r\nthe University of Upsala in Sweden.[616] J. P. Cassell, of Bremen,\r\ndiscusses the Adam of Bremen story in another Latin essay, still\r\nlater.[617]\r\n\r\nAbout 1750, Pieter Kalm, a Swede, brought the matter to the attention\r\nof Dr. Franklin, as the latter remembered twenty-five years later, when\r\nhe wrote to Samuel Mather that “the circumstances gave the account a\r\ngreat appearance of authenticity.”[618] In 1755, Paul Henri Mallet\r\n(1730-1807), in his _Histoire de Dannemarc_, determines the localities\r\nto be Labrador and Newfoundland.[619]\r\n\r\nIn 1769, Gerhard Schöning, in his _Norges Riges Historie_, established\r\nthe scene in America. Robertson, in 1777, briefly mentions the\r\nvoyages in his _Hist. of America_ (note xvii.), and, referring to\r\nthe accounts given by Peringskiöld, calls them rude and confused,\r\nand says that it is impossible to identify the landfalls, though he\r\nthinks Newfoundland may have been the scene of Vinland. This is also\r\nthe belief of J. R. Forster in his _Geschichte der Entdeckungen im\r\nNorden_ (Frankfurt, 1784).[620] M. C. Sprengel, in his _Geschichte\r\nder Europäer in Nordamerika_ (Leipzig, 1782), thinks they went as\r\nfar south as Carolina. Pontoppidan’s _History of Norway_ was mainly\r\nfollowed by Dr. Jeremy Belknap in his _American Biography_ (Boston,\r\n1794), who recognizes “circumstances to confirm and none to disprove\r\nthe relations.” In 1793, Muñoz, in his _Historia del Nuevo Mundo_, put\r\nVinland in Greenland. In 1796 there was a brief account in Fritsch’s\r\n_Disputatio historico-geographica in qua quæritur utrum veteres\r\nAmericam noverint necne_. H. Stenström published at Lund, in 1801, a\r\nshort dissertation, _De America Norvegis ante tempora Columbi adita_.\r\nBoucher de la Richarderie, in his _Bibliothèque Universelle des\r\nVoyages_ (Paris, 1808), gives a short account, and cites some of the\r\nauthorities. Some of the earlier American histories of this century,\r\nlike Williamson’s _North Carolina_, took advantage of the recitals\r\nof Torfæus and Mallet. Ebenezer Henderson’s _Residence in Iceland_\r\n(1814-15)[621] presented the evidence anew. Barrow, in his _Voyages\r\nto the Arctic Regions_ (London, 1818), places Vinland in Labrador or\r\nNewfoundland; but J. W. Moulton, in his _History of the State of New\r\nYork_ (N. Y., 1824), brings that State within the region supposed to\r\nhave been visited.\r\n\r\nA writer more likely to cause a determinate opinion in the public\r\nmind came in Washington Irving, who in his _Columbus_ (London, 1828)\r\ndismissed the accounts as untrustworthy; though later, under the\r\ninfluence of Wheaton and Rafn, he was inclined to consider them of\r\npossible importance; and finally in his condensed edition he thinks\r\nthe facts “established to the conviction of most minds.”[622] Hugh\r\nMurray, in his _Discoveries and Travels in North America_ (London,\r\n1829), regards the sagas as an authority; but he doubts the assigning\r\nof Vinland to America. In 1830, W. D. Cooley, in his _History of\r\nMaritime and Inland Discovery_,[623] thought it impossible to shake the\r\nauthenticity of the sagas.\r\n\r\nWhile Henry Wheaton was the minister of the United States at\r\nCopenhagen, and having access to the collections of that city, he\r\nprepared his _History of the Northmen_, which was published in London\r\nand Philadelphia in 1831.[624] The high character of the man gave\r\nunusual force to his opinions, and his epitome of the sagas in his\r\nsecond chapter contributed much to increase the interest in the\r\nNorthmen story. He was the first who much impressed the New England\r\nantiquaries with the view that Vinland should be looked for in New\r\nEngland; and a French version by Paul Guillot, issued in Paris in 1844,\r\nis stated to have been “revue et augmentée par l’auteur, avec cartes,\r\ninscriptions, et alphabet runique.”[625] The opinions of Wheaton,\r\nhowever, had no effect upon the leading historian of the United States,\r\nnor have any subsequent developments caused any change in the opinion\r\nof Bancroft, first advanced in 1834, in the opening volume of his\r\n_United States_, where he dismissed the sagas as “mythological in\r\nform and obscure in meaning; ancient yet not contemporary.” He adds\r\nthat “the intrepid mariners who colonized Greenland could easily have\r\nextended their voyage to Labrador; but no clear historical evidence\r\nestablishes the natural probability that they accomplished the\r\npassage.”[626] All this is omitted by Bancroft in his last revised\r\nedition; but a paragraph in his original third volume (1840), to the\r\nintent that, though “Scandinavians may have reached the shores of\r\nLabrador, the soil of the United States has not one vestige of their\r\npresence,” is allowed to remain,[627] and is true now as when first\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nThe chief apostle of the Norseman belief, however, is Carl Christian\r\nRafn, whose work was accomplished under the auspices of the Royal\r\nSociety of Northern Antiquaries at Copenhagen.[628]\r\n\r\nRafn was born in 1795, and died at Copenhagen in 1864.[629] At the\r\nUniversity, as well as later as an officer of its library, he had bent\r\nhis attention to the early Norse manuscripts and literature,[630]\r\nso that in 1825 he was the natural founder of the Royal Society of\r\nNorthern Antiquaries; and much of the value of its long series of\r\npublications is due to his active and unflagging interest.[631] The\r\nsummit of his American interest, however, was reached in the great\r\nfolio _Antiquitates Americanæ_,[632] in which he for the first time\r\nput the mass of original Norse documents before the student, and with\r\na larger accumulation of proofs than had ever been adduced before, he\r\ncommented on the narratives and came to conclusions respecting traces\r\nof their occupancy to which few will adhere to-day.\r\n\r\nThe effect of Rafn’s volume, however, was marked, and we see it in the\r\nnumerous presentations of the subject which followed; and every writer\r\nsince has been greatly indebted to him.\r\n\r\nAlexander von Humboldt in his _Examen Critique_ (Paris, 1837) gave a\r\nsynopsis of the sagas, and believed the scene of the discoveries to\r\nbe between Newfoundland and New York; and in his _Cosmos_ (1844) he\r\nreiterated his views, holding to “the undoubted first discovery by the\r\nNorthmen as far south as 41° 30’.”[633]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORSE AMERICA.\r\n\r\nOpposite is a section of Rafn’s map in the _Antiquitates Americanæ_,\r\ngiving his identification of the Norse localities. This and the other\r\nmap by Rafn is reproduced in his _Cabinet d’Antiquités Américaines_\r\n(Copenhagen, 1858). The map in the atlas of St. Martin’s _Hist. de la\r\nGéographie_ does not track them below Newfoundland. The map in J. T.\r\nSmith’s _Northmen in New England_ (Boston, 1839) shows eleven voyages\r\nto America from Scandinavia, A.D. 861-1285. Cf. map in Wilhelmi’s\r\n_Island_, etc. (Heidelberg, 1842).]\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo books which for a while were the popular treatises on the subject\r\nwere the immediate outcome of Rafn’s book. The first of these was _The\r\nNorthmen in New England_, giving the stories in the form of a dialogue,\r\nby Joshua Toulmin Smith (Boston, 1839), which in a second edition\r\n(London, 1842) was called _The Discovery of America by the Northmen in\r\nthe Tenth Century_.\r\n\r\nThe other book was largely an English version of parts of Rafn’s book,\r\ntranslating the chief sagas, and reproducing the maps: Nathaniel Ludlow\r\nBeamish’s _Discovery of America by the Northmen in the Tenth Century_\r\n(London, 1841).[634] Two German books owed almost as much to Rafn,\r\nthose of K. Wilhelmi[635] and K. H. Hermes.[636] Prescott, at this time\r\npublishing the third volume of his _Mexico_ (1843), accords to Rafn\r\nthe credit of taking the matter out of the category of doubt, but he\r\nhesitates to accept the Dane’s identifications of localities; but R. H.\r\nMajor, in considering the question in the introduction to his _Select\r\nletters of Columbus_ (1847), finds little hesitation in accepting the\r\nviews of Rafn, and thinks “no room is left for disputing the main fact\r\nof discovery.”\r\n\r\nWhen Hildreth, in 1849, published his _United States_, he ranged\r\nhimself, with his distrusts, by the side of Bancroft but J. Elliot\r\nCabot, in making a capital summary of the evidence in the _Mass.\r\nQuarterly Review_ (vol. ii.), accords with the believers, but places\r\nthe locality visited about Labrador and Newfoundland. Haven in his\r\n_Archæology of the United States_ (Washington, 1856) regards the\r\ndiscovery as well attested, and that the region was most likely that\r\nof Narragansett Bay. C. W. Elliott in his _New England History_ (N.\r\nY., 1857) holds the story to be “in some degree mythical.” Palfrey\r\nin his _Hist. of New England_ (Boston, 1858) goes no farther than to\r\nconsider the Norse voyage as in “nowise unlikely,” and Oscar F. Peschel\r\nin his _Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen_ (Stuttgart, 1858)\r\nis on the affirmative side. Paul K. Sinding goes over the story with\r\nassent in his _History of Scandinavia_,—a book not much changed in his\r\n_Scandinavian Races_ (N. Y., 1878).[637] Eugène Beauvois did little\r\nmore than translate from Rafn in his _Découvertes des Scandinaves en\r\nAmérique,—fragments de Sagas Islandaises traduits pour la première fois\r\nen français_ (Paris, 1859)—an extract from the _Revue Orientale et\r\nAméricaine_ (vol. ii.).[638]\r\n\r\nProfessor Daniel Wilson, of Toronto, has discussed the subject at\r\ndifferent times, and with these conclusions: “With all reasonable\r\ndoubts as to the accuracy of details, there is the strongest\r\nprobability in favor of the authenticity of the American Vinland....\r\nThe data are the mere vague allusions of a traveller’s tale, and it is\r\nindeed the most unsatisfactory feature of the sagas that the later the\r\nvoyages the more confused and inconsistent their narratives become in\r\nevery point of detail.”[639]\r\n\r\nDr. B. F. De Costa’s first book on the subject was his _Pre-Columbian\r\nDiscovery of America by the Northmen, illustrated by Translations from\r\nthe Icelandic Sagas, edited with notes and a general introduction_\r\n(Albany, 1868). It is a convenient gathering of the essential parts\r\nof the sagas; but the introduction rather opposes than disproves\r\nsome of the “feeble paragraphs, pointed with a sneer,” which he\r\ncharges upon leading opponents of the faith. Professor J. L. Diman,\r\nin the _North American Review_ (July, 1869), made De Costa’s book\r\nthe occasion of an essay setting forth the grounds of a disbelief\r\nin the historical value of the sagas. De Costa replied in _Notes on\r\na Review_, etc. (Charlestown, 1869). In the same year, Dr. Kohl,\r\nfollowing the identifications of Rafn, rehearsed the narratives in his\r\n_Discovery of Maine_ (Portland, 1869), and tracked Karlsefne through\r\nthe gulf of Maine. De Costa took issue with him on this latter point\r\nin his Northmen in Maine (Albany, 1870).[640] In the introduction\r\nto his _Sailing Directions of Henry Hudson_, De Costa argues that\r\nthese mariners’ guides are the same used by the Northmen, and in his\r\n_Columbus and the Geographers of the North_ (Hartford, 1872,—cf. _Amer.\r\nChurch Review_, xxiv. 418) he recapitulates the sagas once more with\r\nreference to the knowledge which he supposes Columbus to have had of\r\nthem. Paul Gaffarel, in his _Etudes sur les rapports de l’Amérique\r\net de l’ancien Continent avant Colomb_ (Paris, 1869), entered more\r\nparticularly into the evidence of the commerce of Vinland and its\r\nrelations to Europe.\r\n\r\nGabriel Gravier, another French author, was rather too credulous in\r\nhis _Découverte de l’Amérique par les normands au X^e Siècle_ (Paris,\r\n1874), when he assumed with as much confidence as Rafn ever did\r\neverything that the most ardent advocate had sought to prove.[641]\r\n\r\nThere were two American writers soon to follow, hardly less\r\nintemperate. These were Aaron Goodrich, in _A History of the Character\r\nand Achievements of the so-called Christopher Columbus_ (N. Y., 1874),\r\nwho took the full complement of Rafn’s belief with no hesitancy;\r\nand Rasmus B. Anderson in his _America not discovered by Columbus_\r\n(Chicago, 1874; improved, 1877; again with Watson’s bibliography,\r\n1883),[642] in which even the Skeleton in Armor is made to play a part.\r\nExcluding such vagaries, the book is not without use as displaying the\r\nexcessive views entertained in some quarters on the subject. The author\r\nis, we believe, a Scandinavian, and shows the tendency of his race to a\r\nfacility rather than felicity in accepting evidence on this subject.\r\n\r\nThe narratives were first detailed among our leading general histories\r\nwhen the _Popular History of the United States_ of Bryant and Gay\r\nappeared in 1876. The claims were presented decidedly, and in the main\r\nin the directions indicated by Rafn; but the wildest pretensions of\r\nthat antiquary were considerately dismissed.\r\n\r\nDuring the last score years the subject has been often made prominent\r\nby travellers like Kneeland[643] and Hayes,[644] who have recapitulated\r\nthe evidence; by lecturers like Charles Kingsley;[645] by monographists\r\nlike Moosmüller;[646] by the minor historians like Higginson,[647] who\r\nhas none of the fervor of the inspired identifiers of localities, and\r\nWeise,[648] who is inclined to believe the sea-rovers did not even pass\r\nDavis’s Straits; and by contributors to the successive sessions of the\r\nCongrès des Américanistes[649] and to other learned societies.[650]\r\n\r\nThe question was brought to a practical issue in Massachusetts by a\r\nproposition raised—at first in Wisconsin—by the well-known musician Ole\r\nBull, to erect in Boston a statue to Leif Ericson.[651] The project,\r\nthough ultimately carried out, was long delayed, and was discouraged\r\nby members of the Massachusetts Historical Society on the ground that\r\nno satisfactory evidence existed to show that any spot in New England\r\nhad been reached by the Northmen.[652] The sense of the society was\r\nfinally expressed in the report of their committee, Henry W. Haynes\r\nand Abner C. Goodell, Jr., in language which seems to be the result of\r\nthe best historical criticism; for it is not a question of the fact of\r\ndiscovery, but to decide how far we can place reliance on the details\r\nof the sagas. There is likely to remain a difference of opinion on\r\nthis point. The committee say: “There is the same sort of reason for\r\nbelieving in the existence of Leif Ericson that there is for believing\r\nin the existence of Agamemnon,—they are both traditions accepted by\r\nlater writers; but there is no more reason for regarding as true the\r\ndetails related about his discoveries than there is for accepting as\r\nhistoric truth the narratives contained in the Homeric poems. It is\r\nantecedently probable that the Northmen discovered America in the\r\nearly part of the eleventh century; and this discovery is confirmed\r\nby the same sort of historical tradition, not strong enough to be\r\ncalled evidence, upon which our belief in many of the accepted facts of\r\nhistory rests.”[653]\r\n\r\nIn running down the history of the literature of the subject, the\r\npresent aim has been simply to pick out such contributions as have\r\nbeen in some way significant, and reference must be made to the\r\nbibliographies for a more perfect record.[654]\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the natural probability of the Northmen visits to\r\nthe American main, other evidence has been often adduced to support\r\nthe sagas. This proof has been linguistic, ethnological, physical,\r\ngeographical, and monumental.\r\n\r\nNothing could be slenderer than the alleged correspondences of\r\nlanguages, and we can see in Horsford’s _Discovery of America by\r\nNorthmen_ to what a fanciful extent a confident enthusiasm can carry\r\nit.[655]\r\n\r\nThe ethnological traces are only less shadowy. Hugo Grotius[656]\r\ncontended that the people of Central America were of Scandinavian\r\ndescent. Brasseur found remnants of Norse civilization in the same\r\nregion.[657] Viollet le Duc[658] discovers great resemblances in the\r\nnorthern religious ceremonials to those described in the _Popul Vuh_. A\r\ngeneral resemblance did not escape the notice of Humboldt. Gravier[659]\r\nis certain that the Aztec civilization is Norse.[660] Chas. Godfrey\r\nLeland claims that the old Norse spirit pervades the myths and legends\r\nof the Algonkins, and that it is impossible not to admit that there\r\nmust have been at one time “extensive intercourse between the Northmen\r\nand the Algonkins;” and in proof he points out resemblances between\r\nthe Eddas and the Algonkin mythology.[661] It is even stated that the\r\nMicmacs have a tradition of a people called Chenooks, who in ships\r\nvisited their coast in the tenth century.\r\n\r\nThe physical and geographical evidences are held to exist in the\r\ncorrespondences of the coast line to the descriptions of the sagas,\r\nincluding the phenomena of the tides[662] and the length of the summer\r\nday.[663] Laing and others, who make no question of the main fact,\r\nreadily recognize the too great generality and contradictions of the\r\ndescriptions to be relied upon.[664]\r\n\r\nGeorge Bancroft, in showing his distrust, has said that the advocates\r\nof identification can no farther agree than to place Vinland anywhere\r\nfrom Greenland to Africa.[665]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nA MAP OF VINLAND from accounts contained in Old Northern M.S.S. by\r\nCHARLES C. RAFN\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The above map is a fac-simile of one of C. C. Rafn’s maps. Cf.\r\nthe maps in Smith, Beamish, Gravier, Slafter, Preble’s _Amer. Flag_,\r\netc. ]\r\n\r\nThe earliest to go so far as to establish to a certainty[666]\r\nthe sites of the sagas was Rafn, who placed them on the coast of\r\nMassachusetts and Rhode Island, wherein nearly all those have followed\r\nhim who have thought it worth while to be thus particular as to\r\nheadland and bay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIGHTON ROCK.[667]]\r\n\r\nIn applying the saga names they have, however, by no means agreed,\r\nfor Krossanes is with some Point Alderton, at the entrance of Boston\r\nHarbor, and with others the Gurnet Head; the island where honey dew\r\nwas found is Nantucket with Rafn, and with De Costa an insular region,\r\nNauset, now under water near the elbow of Cape Cod;[668] the Vinland\r\nof Rafn is in Narragansett Bay, that of Dr. A. C. Hamlin is at Merry\r\nMeeting Bay on the coast of Maine,[669] and that of Horsford is\r\nnorth of Cape Cod,[670]—not to mention other disagreements of other\r\ndisputants.\r\n\r\nWe get something more tangible, if not more decisive, when we come\r\nto the monumental evidences. DeWitt Clinton and Samuel L. Mitchell\r\nfound little difficulty at one time in making many people believe\r\nthat the earthworks of Onondaga were Scandinavian. A pretended runic\r\ninscription on a stone said to have been found in the Grave Creek mound\r\nwas sedulously ascribed to the Northmen.[671] What some have called a\r\nrunic inscription exists on a rock near Yarmouth in Nova Scotia, which\r\nis interpreted “Hako’s son addressed the men,” and is supposed to\r\ncommemorate the expedition of Thorfinn in A.D. 1007.[672] A rock on the\r\nlittle islet of Menana, close to Monhegan, on the coast of Maine, and\r\nusually referred to as the Monhegan Rock, bears certain weather marks,\r\nand there have been those to call them runes.[673] A similar claim is\r\nmade for a rock in the Merrimac Valley.[674] Rafn describes such rocks\r\nas situated in Tiverton and Portsmouth Grove, R. I., but the markings\r\nwere Indian, and when Dr. S. A. Green visited the region in 1868 some\r\nof them had disappeared.[675]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSCRIPTION ON DIGHTON ROCK.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The opposite plate is reduced from one in the _Antiq.\r\nAmericanæ_. They show the difficulty, even before later weathering, of\r\ndifferent persons in discerning the same things on the rock, and in\r\ndiscriminating between fissures and incisions. Col. Garrick Mallery\r\n(_4th Rept. Bureau of Ethnology_, p. 250) asserts that the inscription\r\nhas been “so manipulated that it is difficult now to determine the\r\noriginal details.” The drawings represented are enumerated in the text.\r\nLater ones are numerous. Rafn also gives that of Dr. Baylies and Mr.\r\nGooding in 1790, and that made for the Rhode Island Hist. Society in\r\n1830. The last has perhaps been more commonly copied than the others.\r\nPhotographs of late years are common; but almost invariably the\r\nphotographer has chalked what he deems to be the design,—in this they\r\ndo not agree, of course,—in order to make his picture clearer. I think\r\nSchoolcraft in making his daguerreotype was the first to do this. The\r\nmost careful drawing made of late years is that by Professor Seager of\r\nthe Naval Academy, under the direction of Commodore Blake; and there is\r\nin the Cabinet of the American Antiquarian Society a MS. essay on the\r\nrock, written at Blake’s request by Chaplain Chas. R. Hale of the U. S.\r\nNavy. Haven disputes Blake’s statement that a change in the river’s bed\r\nmore nearly submerges the rock at high tide than was formerly the case.\r\nCf. _Am. Antiq. Soc._ Proc., Oct., 1864, p. 41, where a history of the\r\nrock is given; and in Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_, ii. 93.]\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all these alleged memorials[676] is the Dighton\r\nRock, lying in the tide on the side of Taunton River, in the town\r\nof Berkeley, in Massachusetts.[677] Dr. De Costa thinks it possible\r\nthat the central portion may be runic. This part is what has been\r\ninterpreted to mean that Thorfinn with 151 men took possession of the\r\ncountry, and it is said to be this portion of the inscription which\r\nmodern Indians discard when giving their interpretations.[678] That it\r\nis the work of the Indian of historic times seems now to be the opinion\r\ncommon to the best trained archæologists.[679]\r\n\r\nRafn was also the first to proclaim the stone tower now standing\r\nat Newport, R. I., as a work of the Northmen; but the recent\r\nantiquaries without any exception worth considering, believe that the\r\ninvestigations have shown that it was erected by Governor Arnold of\r\nRhode Island as a windmill, sometime between 1670 and 1680; and Palfrey\r\nin his _New England_ is thought to have put this view beyond doubt in\r\nshowing the close correspondence in design of the tower to a mill at\r\nChesterton, in England.[680]\r\n\r\nCertain hearthstones which were discovered over twenty-five years\r\nago under a peat bed on Cape Cod were held at the time to be a\r\nNorse relic.[681] In 1831 there was exhumed in Fall River, Mass.,\r\na skeleton, which had with it what seemed to be an ornamental belt\r\nmade of metal tubes, formed by rolling fragments of flat brass and an\r\noblong plate of the same metal,—not of bronze, as is usually said,—with\r\nsome arrow-heads, cut evidently from the same material. The other\r\nconcomitants of the burial indicated an Indian of the days since the\r\nEnglish contact. The skeleton attracted notice in this country by being\r\nconnected with the Norsemen in Longfellow’s ballad, _The Skeleton in\r\nArmor_, and Dr. Webb sent such an account of it to the Royal Society of\r\nNorthern Antiquaries that it was looked upon as another and distinct\r\nproof of the identification of Vinland. Later antiquaries have\r\ndismissed all beliefs of that nature.[682]\r\n\r\nThere is not a single item of all the evidence thus advanced from\r\ntime to time which can be said to connect by archæological traces the\r\npresence of the Northmen on the soil of North America south of Davis’\r\nStraits. Arguments of this kind have been abandoned except by a few\r\nenthusiastic advocates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat the Northmen voyaging to Vinland encountered natives, and that\r\nthey were called Skraelings, may be taken as a sufficiently broad\r\nstatement in the sagas to be classed with those concomitants of the\r\nvoyages which it is reasonable to accept. Sir William Dawson (_Fossil\r\nMen_, 49) finds it easy to believe that these natives were our red\r\nIndians; and Gallatin saw no reason to dissociate the Eskimos with\r\nother American tribes.[683] That they were Eskimos seems to be the more\r\ncommonly accepted view.[684]\r\n\r\nThat the climate of the Atlantic coast of the United States and the\r\nBritish provinces was such as was favorable to the present Arctic\r\ndwellers is held to be shown by such evidences as tusks of the walrus\r\nfound in phosphate beds in South Carolina. Rude implements found in\r\nthe interglacial Jersey drift have been held by C. C. Abbott to have\r\nbeen associated with a people of the Eskimo stock, and some have noted\r\nthat palæolithic implements found in Pennsylvania closely resemble the\r\nwork of the modern Eskimos (_Amer. Antiquarian_, i. 10).[685] Dall\r\nremarks upon implements of Innuit origin being found four hundred\r\nmiles south of the present range of the Eskimos of the northwest coast\r\n(_Contributions to Amer. Ethnology_, i. p. 98). Charlevoix says that\r\nEskimos were occasionally seen in Newfoundland in the beginning of the\r\nlast century; and ethnologists recognize to-day the same stock in the\r\nEskimos of Labrador and Greenland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HINRIK RINK.\r\n\r\nAfter a likeness given by Nordenskjöld in his _Exped. till Grönland_,\r\np. 121.]\r\n\r\nThe best authority on the Eskimos is generally held to be Hinrich\r\nRink, and he contends that they formerly occupied the interior of\r\nthe continent, and have been pressed north and across Behring’s\r\nStraits.[686] W. H. Dall holds similar views.[687] C. R. Markham,\r\nwho dates their first appearance in Greenland in 1349, contends, on\r\nthe other hand, that they came from the west (Siberia) along the\r\npolar regions (Wrangell Land), and drove out the Norse settlers in\r\nGreenland.[688] The most active of the later students of the Eskimos\r\nis Dr. Franz Boas, now of New York, who has discussed their tribal\r\nboundaries.[689]\r\n\r\n\r\n=F.= THE LOST GREENLAND COLONIES.—After intercourse with the colonies\r\nin Greenland ceased, and definite tradition in Iceland had died out,\r\nand when the question of the re-discovery should arise, it was natural\r\nthat attention should first be turned to that coast of Greenland which\r\nlay opposite Iceland as the likelier sites of the lost colonies, and\r\nin this way we find all the settlements placed in the maps of the\r\nsixteenth century. The Archbishop Erik Walkendorf, of Lund, in the\r\nearly part of that century had failed to persuade the Danish government\r\nto send an expedition. King Frederick II was induced, however, to\r\nsend one in 1568; but it accomplished nothing; and again in 1579 he\r\nput another in command of an Englishman, Jacob Allday, but the ice\r\nprevented his landing. A Danish navigator was more successful in 1581;\r\nbut the coast opposite Iceland yielded as yet no traces of the Norse\r\nsettlers. Frobisher’s discovery of the west coast seems to have failed\r\nof recognition among the Danes; but they with the rest of Europe did\r\nnot escape noting the importance of the explorations of John Davis in\r\n1585-86, through the straits which bear his name. It now became the\r\nbelief that the west settlement must be beyond Cape Farewell. In 1605,\r\nChristian IV of Denmark sent a new expedition under Godske Lindenow;\r\nbut there was a Scotchman in command of one of the three ships, and\r\nJacob Hall, who had probably served under Davis, went as the fleet\r\npilot. He guided the vessels through Davis’s Straits. But it was rather\r\nthe purpose of Lindenow to find a northwest passage than to discover a\r\nlost colony; and such was mainly the object which impelled him again in\r\n1606, and inspired Karsten Rikardsen in 1607. Now and for some years to\r\ncome we have the records of voyages made by the whalers to this region,\r\nand we read their narratives in Purchas and in such collections of\r\nvoyages as those of Harris and Churchill.[690] They yield us, however,\r\nlittle or no help in the problem we are discussing. In 1670 and 1671\r\nChristian V sent expeditions with the express purpose of discovering\r\nthe lost colonies; but Otto Axelsen, who commanded, never returned from\r\nhis second voyage, and we have no account of his first.\r\n\r\nThe mission of the priest Hans Egede gave the first real glimmer\r\nof light.[691] He was the earliest to describe the ruins and relics\r\nobservable on the west coast, but he continued to regard the east\r\nsettlements as belonging to the east coast, and so placed them on the\r\nmap. Anderson (Hamburg, 1746) went so far as to place on his map the\r\ncathedral of Gardar in a fixed location on the east coast, and his map\r\nwas variously copied in the following years.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 an expedition left Copenhagen to explore the east coast for\r\ntraces of the colonies, but the ice prevented the approach to the\r\ncoast, and after attempts in that year and in 1787 the effort was\r\nabandoned. Heinrich Peter von Eggers, in his _Om Grönlands österbygds\r\nsande Beliggenhed_ (1792), and _Ueber die wahre Lage des alten\r\nOstgrönlands_ (Kiel, 1794), a German translation, first advanced the\r\nopinion that the eastern colony as well as the western must have\r\nbeen on the west coast, and his views were generally accepted; but\r\nWormskjöld in the _Skandinavisk Litteraturselskab’s Skrifter_, vol. x.\r\n(Copenhagen, 1814), still adhered to the earlier opinions, and Saabye\r\nstill believed it possible to reach the east coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REDUCED FAC-SIMILE.\r\n\r\n[Harvard College Library copy.]]\r\n\r\nSome years later (1828-31) W. A. Graah made, by order of the king\r\nof Denmark, a thorough examination of the east coast, and in his\r\n_Undersögelses Reise til Ostkysten af Grönland_ (Copenhagen, 1832)[692]\r\nhe was generally thought to establish the great improbability of any\r\ntraces of a colony ever existing on that coast. Of late years Graah’s\r\nconclusions have been questioned, for there have been some sites of\r\nbuildings discovered on the east side.[693] The Reverend J. Brodbeck,\r\na missionary, described some in _The Moravian Quarterly_, July and\r\nAug., 1882. Nordenskjöld has held that when the east coast is explored\r\nfrom 65° to 69°, there is a chance of discovering the site of an east\r\ncolony.[694]\r\n\r\nR. H. Major, in a paper (_Journal Roy. Geog. Soc._, 1873, p. 184) on\r\nthe site of the lost colony, questioned Graah’s conclusions, and gave\r\na sketch map, in which he placed its site near Cape Farewell; and he\r\nbased his geographical data largely upon the chorography of Greenland\r\nand the sailing directions of Ivan Bardsen, who was probably an\r\nIcelander living in Greenland some time in the fifteenth century.[695]\r\n\r\n\r\n=G.= MADOC AND THE WELSH.—Respecting the legends of Madoc, there are\r\nreports, which Humboldt (_Cosmos_, Bohn, ii. 610) failed to verify, of\r\nWelsh bards rehearsing the story before 1492,[696] and of statements\r\nin the early Welsh annals. The original printed source is in Humfrey\r\nLloyd’s _History of Cambria, now called Wales, written in the British\r\nlanguage_ [by Caradoc] _about 200 years past_ (London, 1584).[697]\r\nThe book contained corrections and additions by David Powell, and\r\nit was in these that the passages of importance were found, and the\r\nsupposition was that the land visited lay near the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nRichard Hakluyt, in his _Principall Navigations_, took the story from\r\nPowell, and connected the discovery with Mexico in his edition of 1589,\r\nand with the West Indies in that of 1600 (iii. p. 1),—and there was not\r\nan entire absence of the suspicion that it was worth while to establish\r\nsome sort of a British claim to antedate the Spanish one established\r\nthrough Columbus.[698]\r\n\r\nThe linguistic evidences were not brought into prominence till after\r\none Morgan Jones had fallen among the Tuscaroras[699] in 1660, and\r\nfound, as he asserted, that they could understand his Welsh. He wrote\r\na statement of his experience in 1685-6, which was not printed till\r\n1740.[700]\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century we find Campanius in his _Nye Swerige_\r\n(1702) repeating the story; Torfæus (_Hist. Vinlandiæ_, 1705) not\r\nrejecting it; Carte (_England_, 1747) thinking it probable; while\r\nCampbell (_Admirals_, 1742), Lyttleton (_Henry the Second_, 1767), and\r\nRobertson (_America_, 1777) thought there was no ground, at least, for\r\nconnecting the story with America.\r\n\r\nIt was reported that in 1764 a man, Griffeth, was taken by the Shawnees\r\nto a tribe of Indians who spoke Welsh.[701] In 1768, Charles Beatty\r\npublished his _Journal of a two months’ Tour in America_ (London), in\r\nwhich he repeated information of Indians speaking Welsh in Pennsylvania\r\nand beyond the Mississippi, and of the finding of a Welsh Bible among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn 1772-73, David Jones wandered among the tribes west of the Ohio,\r\nand in 1774, at Burlington, published his _Journal of two visits_, in\r\nwhich he enumerates the correspondence of words which he found in their\r\ntongues with his native Welsh.[702]\r\n\r\nWithout noting other casual mentions, some of which will be found\r\nin Paul Barron Watson’s bibliography (in Anderson’s _America not\r\ndiscovered by Columbus_, p. 142), it is enough to say that towards\r\nthe end of the century the papers of John Williams[703] and George\r\nBurder[704] gave more special examination to the subject than had been\r\napplied before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BRITISH SHIP.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in _The Mirror of Literature_, etc. (London, 1823), vol. i.\r\np. 177, showing a vessel then recently exhumed in Kent, and supposed to\r\nbe of the time of Edward I, or the thirteenth century. The vessel was\r\nsixty-four feet long.]\r\n\r\nThe renewed interest in the matter seems to have prompted Southey to\r\nthe writing of his poem _Madoc_, though he refrained from publishing it\r\nfor some years. If one may judge from his introductory note, Southey\r\nheld to the historical basis of the narrative. Meanwhile, reports were\r\npublished of this and the other tribes being found speaking Welsh.[705]\r\nIn 1816, Henry Kerr printed at Elizabethtown, New Jersey, his _Travels\r\nthrough the Western interior of the United States, 1808-16, with some\r\naccount of a tribe whose customs are similar to those of the ancient\r\nWelsh_. In 1824, Yates and Moulton (_State of New York_) went over the\r\nground rather fully, but without conviction. Hugh Murray (_Travels\r\nin North America_, London, 1829) believes the Welsh went to Spain.\r\nIn 1834, the different sides of the case were discussed by Farcy and\r\nWarden in Dupaix’s _Antiquités Méxicaines_. Some years later the\r\npublication of George Catlin[706] probably gave more conviction than\r\nhad been before felt,[707] arising from his statements of positive\r\nlinguistic correspondences in the language of the so-called White[708]\r\nMandans[709] on the Missouri River, the similarity of their boats to\r\nthe old Welsh coracles, and other parallelisms of custom. He believed\r\nthat Madoc landed at Florida, or perhaps passed up the Mississippi\r\nRiver. His conclusions were a reinforcement of those reached by\r\nWilliams.[710] The opinion reached by Major in his edition of\r\n_Columbus’ Letters_ (London, 1847) that the Welsh discovery was quite\r\npossible, while it was by no means probable, is with little doubt the\r\nview most generally accepted to-day; while the most that can be made\r\nout of the claim is presented with the latest survey in B. F. Bowen’s\r\n_America discovered by the Welsh in 1170_ A.D. (Philad., 1876). He\r\ngathers up, as helping his proposition, such widely scattered evidences\r\nas the Lake Superior copper mines and the Newport tower, both of which\r\nhe appropriates; and while following the discoverers from New England\r\nsouth and west, he does not hesitate to point out the resemblance of\r\nthe Ohio Valley mounds[711] to those depicted in Pennant’s _Tour of\r\nWales_; and he even is at no loss for proofs among the relics of the\r\nAztecs.[712]\r\n\r\n\r\n=H.= THE ZENI AND THEIR MAP.—Something has been said elsewhere (Vol.\r\nIII. p. 100) of the influence of the Zeni narrative and its map, in\r\nconfusing Frobisher in his voyages. The map was reproduced in the\r\nPtolemy of 1561, with an account of the adventures of the brothers, but\r\nit was so far altered as to dissever Greenland from Norway, of which\r\nthe Zeni map had made it but an extension.[713]\r\n\r\nThe story got further currency in Ramusio (1574, vol. ii.), Ortelius\r\n(1575), Hakluyt (1600, vol. iii.), Megiser’s _Septentrio Novantiquus_\r\n(1613), Purchas (1625), Pontanus’ _Rerum Danicarum_ (1631), Luke\r\nFox’s _North-West Fox_ (1633), and in De Laet’s Notæ (1644), who,\r\nas well as Hornius, _De Originibus Americanis_ (1644), thinks the\r\nstory suspicious. It was repeated by Montanus in 1671, and by Capel,\r\n_Vorstellungen des Norden_, in 1676. Some of the features of the map\r\nhad likewise become pretty constant in the attendant cartographical\r\nrecords. But from the close of the seventeenth century for about a\r\nhundred years, the story was for the most part ignored, and it was not\r\ntill 1784 that the interest in it was revived by the publications of\r\nForster[714] and Buache,[715] who each expressed their belief in the\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nA more important inquiry in behalf of the narrative took place at\r\nVenice in 1808, when Cardinal Zurla republished the map in an essay,\r\nand marked out the track of the Zeni on a modern chart.[716]\r\n\r\nIn 1810, Malte-Brun accorded his belief in the verity of the narrative,\r\nand was inclined to believe that the Latin books found in Estotiland\r\nwere carried there by colonists from Greenland.[717] A reactionary view\r\nwas taken by Biddle in his _Sebastian Cabot_, in 1831, who believed\r\nthe publication of 1558 a fraud; but the most effective denial of its\r\nauthenticity came a few years later in sundry essays by Zahrtmann.[718]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RICHARD H. MAJOR.\r\n\r\n[After a photograph kindly furnished by himself at the editor’s\r\nrequest.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe story got a strong advocate, after nearly forty years of\r\ncomparative rest, when R. H. Major, of the map department of the\r\nBritish Museum, gave it an English dress and annexed a commentary, all\r\nof which was published by the Hakluyt Society in 1873. In this critic’s\r\nview, the good parts of the map are of the fourteenth century, gathered\r\non the spot, while the false parts arose from the misapprehensions of\r\nthe young Zeno, who put together the book of 1558.[719] The method of\r\nthis later Zeno was in the same year (1873) held by Professor Konrad\r\nMaurer to be hardly removed from a fraudulent compilation of other\r\nexisting material. There has been a marked display of learning, of late\r\nyears, in some of the discussions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BARON NORDENSKJÖLD.\r\n\r\n[From a recent photograph. There is another engraved likeness in the\r\nsecond volume of his _Vega_.]]\r\n\r\nCornelio Desimoni, the archivist of Genoa, has printed two elaborate\r\npapers.[720] The Danish archivist Frederik Krarup published (1878) a\r\nsceptical paper in the _Geografisk Tidsskrift_ (ii. 145).[721] The most\r\nexhaustive examination, however, has come from a practical navigator,\r\nthe Baron A. E. Nordenskjöld, who in working up the results of his own\r\nArctic explorations was easily led into the intricacies of the Zeno\r\ncontroversy. The results which he reaches are that the Zeni narratives\r\nare substantially true; that there was no published material in 1558\r\nwhich could have furnished so nearly an accurate account of the actual\r\ncondition of those northern waters; that the map which Zahrtmann saw in\r\nthe University library at Copenhagen, and which he represented to be an\r\noriginal from which the young Zeno of 1558 made his pretended original,\r\nwas in reality nothing but the Donis map in the Ptolemy of 1482, while\r\nthe Zeno map is much more like the map of the north made by Claudius\r\nClavis in 1427, which was discovered by Nordenskjöld in a codex of\r\nPtolemy at Nancy.[722]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince Nordenskjöld advanced his views there have been two\r\nother examinations: the one by Professor Japetus Steenstrup of\r\nCopenhagen,[723] and the other by the secretary of the Danish\r\nGeographical Society, Professor Ed. Erslef, who offered some new\r\nillustrations in his _Nye Oplysninger om Broedrene Zenis Rejser_\r\n(Copenhagen, 1885).[724]\r\n\r\nAmong those who accept the narratives there is no general agreement\r\nin identifying the principal geographical points of the Zeno map. The\r\nmain dispute is upon Frislanda, the island where the Zeni were wrecked.\r\nThat it was Iceland has been maintained by Admiral Irminger,[725] and\r\nSteenstrup (who finds, however, the text not to agree with the map),\r\nwhile the map accompanying the _Studi biografici e bibliografici sulla\r\nstoria della geografia in Italia_ (Rome, 1882) traces the route of the\r\nZeni from Iceland to Greenland, under 70° of latitude.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Major has contended for the Faröe islands, arguing\r\nthat while the engraved Zeno map shows a single large island, it\r\nmight have been an archipelago in the original, with outlines run\r\ntogether by the obscurities of its dilapidation, and that the Faröes by\r\ntheir preserved names and by their position correspond best with the\r\nFrislanda of the Zeni.[726] Major’s views have been adopted by most\r\nlater writers, perhaps, and a similar identification had earlier been\r\nmade by Lelewel,[727] Kohl,[728] and others.\r\n\r\nThe identification of Estotiland involves the question if the returned\r\nfisherman of the narrative ever reached America. It is not uncommon\r\nfor even believers in the story to deny that Estotiland and Drogeo\r\nwere America. That they were parts of the New World was, however, the\r\napparent belief of Mercator and of many of the cartographers following\r\nthe publication of 1558, and of such speculators as Hugo Grotius, but\r\nthere was little common consent in their exact position.[729]\r\n\r\n\r\n=I.= ALLEGED JEWISH MIGRATION.—The identification of the native\r\nAmericans with the stock of the lost tribes of Israel very soon\r\nbecame a favorite theory with the early Spanish priests settled in\r\nAmerica. Las Casas and Duran adopted it, while Torquemada and Acosta\r\nrejected it. André Thevet, of mendacious memory, did not help the\r\ntheory by espousing it. It was approved in J. F. Lumnius’s _De extremo\r\nDei Judicio et Indorum vocatione, libri iii._ (Venice and Antwerp,\r\n1569);[730] and a century later the belief attracted new attention\r\nin the _Origen de los Americanos de Manasseh Ben Israel_, published\r\nat Amsterdam in 1650.[731] It was in the same year (1650) that the\r\nquestion received the first public discussion in English in Thomas\r\nThorowgood’s _Jewes in America, or, Probabilities that the Americans\r\nare of that Race. With the removall of some contrary reasonings, and\r\nearnest desires for effectuall endeavours to make them Christian_\r\n(London, 1650).[732] Thorowgood was answered by Sir Hamon L’Estrange\r\nin _Americans no Iewes, or Improbabilities that the Americans are of\r\nthat race_ (London, 1652). The views of Thorowgood found sympathy\r\nwith the Apostle Eliot of Massachusetts; and when Thorowgood replied\r\nto L’Estrange he joined with it an essay by Eliot, and the joint work\r\nwas entitled _Iewes in America, or probabilities that those Indians\r\nare Judaical, made more probable by some additionals to the former\r\nconjectures: an accurate discourse is premised of Mr. John Eliot (who\r\npreached the gospel to the natives in their own language) touching\r\ntheir origination, and his Vindication of the planters_ (London,\r\n1660). What seems to have been a sort of supplement, covering,\r\nhowever, in part, the same ground, appeared as _Vindiciæ Judæcorum,\r\nor a true account of the Jews, being more accurately illustrated than\r\nheretofore_, which includes what is called “The learned conjectures of\r\nRev. Mr. John Eliot” (32 pp.). Some of the leading New England divines,\r\nlike Mayhew and Mather,[733] espoused the cause with similar faith.\r\nRoger Williams also was of the same opinion. William Penn is said to\r\nhave held like views. The belief may be said to have been general,\r\nand had not died out in New England when Samuel Sewall, in 1697,\r\npublished his _Phænomena quædam Apocalyptica ad aspectum Novi Orbis\r\nConfigurata_.[734]\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the last century we begin to find new signs of\r\nthe belief. Charles Beatty, in his _Journal of a two months’ tour\r\nwith a view of promoting religion among the frontier inhabitants of\r\nPennsylvania_ (Lond., 1768), finds traces of the lost tribes among the\r\nDelawares, and repeats a story of the Indians long ago selling the\r\nsame sacred book to the whites with which the missionaries in the end\r\naimed to make them acquainted. Gerard de Brahm and Richard Peters,\r\nboth familiar with the Southern Indians, found grounds for accepting\r\nthe belief. The most elaborate statement drawn from this region is\r\nthat of James Adair, who for forty years had been a trader among the\r\nSouthern Indians.[735] Jonathan Edwards in 1788 pointed out in the\r\nHebrew some analogies to the native speech.[736] Charles Crawford in\r\n1799 undertook the proof.[737] In 1816 Elias Boudinot, a man eminent\r\nin his day, contributed further arguments.[738] Ethan Smith based his\r\nadvocacy largely on the linguistic elements.[739] A few years later\r\nan Englishman, Israel Worsley, worked over the material gathered by\r\nBoudinot and Smith, and added something.[740] A prominent American\r\nJew, M. M. Noah, published in 1837 an address on the subject which\r\nhardly added to the weight of testimony.[741] J. B. Finlay, a mulatto\r\nmissionary among the Wyandots, was satisfied with the Hebrew traces\r\nwhich he observed in that tribe.[742] Geo. Catlin, working also among\r\nthe Western Indians, while he could not go to the length of believing\r\nin the lost tribes, was struck with the many analogies which he\r\nsaw.[743] The most elaborate of all expositions of the belief was made\r\nby Lord Kingsborough in his _Mexican Antiquities_ (1830-48).[744] Since\r\nthis book there has been no pressing of the question with any claims to\r\nconsideration.[745]\r\n\r\n\r\n=J.= POSSIBLE EARLY AFRICAN MIGRATIONS.—These may have been by\r\nadventure or by helpless drifting, with or without the Canaries as a\r\nhalting-place. The primitive people of the Canaries, the Guanches, are\r\nstudied in Sabin Berthelot’s _Antiquités Canariennes_ (Paris, 1879)\r\nand A. F. de Fontpertuis’ _L’archipel des Canaries, et ses populations\r\nprimitives_, also in the _Revue de Géographie_, June, 1882, not to\r\nmention earlier histories of the Canary Islands (see Vol. II. p. 36).\r\nRetzius of Stockholm traces resemblances in the skulls of the Guanches\r\nand the Caribs (_Smithsonian Rept._, 1859, p. 266). Le Plongeon finds\r\nthe sandals of the statue Chac-mool, discovered by him in Yucatan, to\r\nresemble those of the Guanches (Salisbury’s _Le Plongeon in Yucatan_,\r\n57).\r\n\r\nThe African and even Egyptian origin of the Caribs has had some\r\nspecial advocates.[746] Peter Martyr, and Grotius following him,\r\ncontended for the people of Yucatan being Ethiopian Christians. Stories\r\nof blackamoors being found by the early Spaniards are not without\r\ncorroboration.[747] The correspondence of the African and South\r\nAmerican flora has been brought into requisition as confirmatory.[748]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE CARTOGRAPHY OF GREENLAND.\r\n\r\nThe oldest map yet discovered to show any part of Greenland, and\r\nconsequently of America,[749] is one found by Baron Nordenskjöld\r\nattached to a Ptolemy Codex in the Stadtbibliothek at Nancy. He\r\npresented a colored fac-simile of it in 1883 at the Copenhagen Congrès\r\ndes Américanistes, in his little brochure _Trois Cartes_. It was also\r\nused in illustration of his paper on the Zeni Voyages, published\r\nboth in Swedish and German. It will be seen by the fac-simile given\r\nherewith, and marked with the author’s name, Claudius Clavus, that\r\n“Gronlandia Provincia” is an extension of a great arctic region, so\r\nas to lie over against the Scandinavian peninsula of Europe, with\r\n“Islandia,” or Iceland, midway between the two lands. Up to the time\r\nof this discovery by Nordenskjöld, the map generally recognized as the\r\noldest to show Greenland is a Genovese portolano, preserved in the\r\nPitti Palace at Florence, about which there is some doubt as to its\r\ndate, which is said to be 1417 by Santarem (_Hist. de la Cartog._,\r\niii., p. xix), but Lelewel (_Epilogue_, p. 167) is held to be trustier\r\nin giving it as 1447.[750] It shows how little influence the Norse\r\nstories of their Greenland colonization exerted at this time on the\r\ncartography of the north, that few of the map-makers deemed it worth\r\nwhile to break the usual terminal circle of the world by including\r\nanything west or beyond Iceland. It was, further, not easy to convince\r\nthem that Greenland, when they gave it, lay in the direction which\r\nthe Sagas indicated. The map of Fra Mauro, for instance, in 1459 cuts\r\noff a part of Iceland by its incorrigible terminal circle, as will\r\nbe seen in a bit of it given herewith, the reader remembering as he\r\nlooks at it that the bottom of the segment is to the north.[751] We\r\nagain owe to Nordenskjöld the discovery of another map of the north,\r\n_Tabula Regionum Septentrionalium_, which he found in a Codex of\r\nPtolemy in Warsaw a few years since, and which he places about 1467.\r\nThe accompanying partial sketch is reproduced from a fac-simile\r\nkindly furnished by the discoverer. The peninsula of “Gronlandia,”\r\nwith its indicated glaciers, is placed with tolerable accuracy as the\r\nwestern extremity of an arctic region, which to the north of Europe\r\nis separated from the Scandinavian peninsula by a channel from the\r\n“Mare Gotticum” (Baltic Sea), which sweeps above Norway into the\r\n“Mare Congelatum.” The confused notions arising from an attempt by\r\nthe compiler of the map to harmonize different drafts is shown by\r\nhis drawing a second Greenland (“Engronelant”) to his “Norbegia,” or\r\nNorway, and placing just under it the “Thile”[752] of the ancients,\r\nwhich he makes a different island from “Islandia,” placed in proper\r\nrelations to his larger Greenland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLAUDIUS CLAVUS, 1427.]\r\n\r\nA few years later, or perhaps about the same time, and before 1471,\r\nthe earliest engraved map which shows Greenland is that of Nicolas\r\nDonis, in the Ulm edition of Ptolemy in 1482. It will be seen from the\r\nlittle sketch which is annexed that the same doubling of Greenland is\r\nadhered to.[753] With the usual perversion put upon the Norse stories,\r\nIceland is made to lie due west of Greenland, though not shown in the\r\npresent sketch.\r\n\r\nAt a date not much later, say 1486, it is supposed the Laon globe,\r\ndated in 1493, was actually made, or at least it is shown that in some\r\nparts the knowledge was rather of the earlier date, and here we have\r\n“Grolandia,” a small island off the Norway coast.[754]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLAUDIUS CLAVUS, 1427.]\r\n\r\nWe have in 1489-90 a type of configuration, which later became\r\nprevalent. It is taken from an _Insularium illustratum Henrici Martelli\r\nGermani_, a manuscript preserved in the British Museum, and shows, as\r\nseen by the annexed extract, a long narrow peninsula, running southwest\r\nfrom the northern verge of Europe. A sketch of the whole map is given\r\nelsewhere.[755]\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been the prevailing notion of what and where\r\nGreenland was at the time of Columbus’ voyage, and it could have\r\ncarried no significance to his mind that the explorations of the Norse\r\nhad found the Asiatic main, which he started to discover. How far this\r\nnotion was departed from by Behaim in his globe of 1492 depends upon\r\nthe interpretation to be given to a group of islands, northwest of\r\nIceland and northeast of Asia, upon the larger of which he writes among\r\nits mountains, “Hi man weise Volker.”[756]\r\n\r\nAs this sketch of the cartographical development goes on, it will be\r\nseen how slow the map-makers were to perceive the real significance\r\nof the Norse discoveries, and how reluctant they were to connect them\r\nwith the discoveries that followed in the train of Columbus, though\r\noccasionally there is one who is possessed with a sort of prevision.\r\nThe Cantino map of 1502[757] does not settle the question, for a point\r\nlying northeast of the Portuguese discoveries in the Newfoundland\r\nregion only seems to be the southern extremity of Greenland. What was\r\napparently a working Portuguese chart of 1503 grasps pretty clearly the\r\nrelations of Greenland to Labrador.[758]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRA MAURO, 1459.]\r\n\r\nLelewel (pl. 43), in a map made to show the Portuguese views at\r\nthis time,[759] which he represents by combining and reconciling the\r\nPtolemy maps of 1511 and 1513, still places the “Gronland” peninsula\r\nin the northwest of Europe, and if his deductions are correct, the\r\nPortuguese had as yet reached no clear conception that the Labrador\r\ncoasts upon which they fished bore any close propinquity to those\r\nwhich the Norse had colonized. Ruysch, in 1508, made a bold stroke by\r\nputting “Gruenlant” down as a peninsula of Northeastern Asia, thus\r\ntrying to reconcile the discoveries of Columbus with the northern\r\nsagas.[760] This view was far from acceptable. Sylvanus, in the Ptolemy\r\nof 1511, made “Engroneland” a small protuberance on the north shore\r\nof Scandinavia, and east of Iceland, evidently choosing between the\r\ntwo theories instead of accepting both, as was common, in ignorance of\r\ntheir complemental relations.[761] Waldseemüller, in the Ptolemy of\r\n1513, in his “Orbis typus universalis,” reverted to and adopted the\r\ndelineation of Henricus Martellus in 1490.[762]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TABULA REGIONUM SEPTENTRIONALIUM, 1467.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DONIS, 1482.]\r\n\r\nIn 1520, Apian, in the map in Camer’s _Solinus_, took the view of\r\nSylvanus, while still another representation was given by Laurentius\r\nFrisius in 1522, in an edition of Ptolemy,[763] in which “Gronland”\r\nbecomes a large island on the Norway coast, in one map called “Orbis\r\ntypus Universalis,” while in another map, “Tabula nova Norbegiæ et\r\nGottiæ,” the “Engronelant” peninsula is a broad region, stretching\r\nfrom Northwestern Europe.[764]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRICUS MARTELLUS, 1489-90.]\r\n\r\nThis Ptolemy was again issued in 1525, repeating these two methods of\r\nshowing Greenland already given, and adding a third,[765] that of the\r\nlong narrow European peninsula, already familiar in earlier maps—the\r\nvariety of choice indicating the prevalent cartographical indecision on\r\nthe point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLAUS MAGNUS, 1539.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—This fac-simile accompanies a paper appearing in the\r\n_Videnskabsselskabs Forhandinger_ (1886, no. 15) _and separately as\r\nDie ächte karte des Olaus Magnus vom jahre 1539, nach dem exemplar der\r\nMünchener Staatsbibliothek_ (Christiania, 1886). In this Dr. Brenner\r\ntraces the history of the great map of Archbishop Olaus Magnus,\r\npointing out how Nordenskjöld is in error in supposing the map of\r\n1567, which that scholar gives, was but a reproduction of the original\r\nedition of 1539, which was not known to modern students till Brenner\r\nfound it in the library at Munich, in March, 1886, and which proves to\r\nbe twelve times larger than that of 1567. Brenner adds the long Latin\r\naddress, “Olaus Gothus benigno lectori salutem,” with annotations. The\r\nmap is entitled “Carta Marina et descriptio septentrionalium errarum ac\r\nmirabilium rerum in eis contentarum diligentissime elaborata, Anno Dni,\r\n1539.” Brenner institutes a close comparison between it and the Zeno\r\nchart.]\r\n\r\nKohl, in his collection of maps,[766] copies from what he calls the\r\nAtlas of Frisius, 1525, still another map which apparently shows the\r\nsouthern extremity of Greenland, with “Terra Laboratoris,” an island\r\njust west of it, and southwest of that a bit of coast marked “Terra\r\nNova Conterati,” which may pass for Newfoundland and the discoveries of\r\nCortereal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLAUS MAGNUS, 1555.\r\n\r\nThis map, here reproduced on a somewhat smaller scale, is called:\r\n_Regnorum Aquilonarum descriptio, hujus Operis subiectum_.]\r\n\r\nThorne, the Englishman, in the map which he sent from Seville in\r\n1527,[767] seems to conform to the view which made Greenland a European\r\npeninsula, which may also have been the opinion of Orontius Finæus in\r\n1531.[768] A novel feature attaches to an Atlas, of about this date,\r\npreserved at Turin, in which an elongated Greenland is made to stretch\r\nnortherly.[769] In 1532 we have the map in Ziegler’s _Schondia_, which\r\nmore nearly resembles the earliest map of all, that of Claudius Clavus,\r\nthan any other.[770] The 1538 cordiform map of Mercator makes it a\r\npeninsula of an arctic region connected with Scandinavia.[771] This\r\nmap is known to me only through a fac-simile of the copy given in the\r\n_Geografia_ of Lafreri, published at Rome about 1560, with which I am\r\nfavored by Nordenskjöld in advance of its publication in his _Atlas_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM OLAUS MAGNUS’ HISTORIA, 1567.]\r\n\r\nThe great _Historia_ of Olaus Magnus, as for a long time the leading\r\nauthority on the northern geography, as well as on the Scandinavian\r\nchronicles, gives us some distinct rendering of this northern\r\ngeographical problem. It was only recently that his earliest map of\r\n1539 has been brought to light, and a section of it is here reproduced\r\nfrom a much reduced fac-simile kindly sent to the editor by Dr. Oscar\r\nBrenner of the university at Munich.[A] Nordenskjöld, in giving a full\r\nfac-simile of the Olaus Magnus map of 1567,[772] of which a fragment\r\nis herewith also given in fac-simile, says that it embodies the views\r\nof the northern geographers in separating Greenland from Europe,\r\nwhich was in opposition to those of the geographers of the south of\r\nEurope, who united Greenland to Scandinavia. Sebastian Münster in his\r\n1540 edition of Ptolemy introduced a new confusion. He preserved the\r\nEuropean elongated peninsula, but called it “Islandia,” while to what\r\nstands for Iceland is given the old classical name of Thyle.[773] This\r\nconfusion is repeated in his map of 1545,[774] where he makes the coast\r\nof “Islandia” continuous with Baccalaos. This continuity of coast line\r\nseemed now to become a common heritage of some of the map-makers,[775]\r\nthough in the Ulpius globe of 1542 “Groestlandia,” so far as it is\r\nshown, stands separate from either continent,[776] but is connected\r\nwith Europe according to the early theory in the _Isolario_ of Bordone\r\nin 1547.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BORDONE’S SCANDINAVIA, 1547.\r\n\r\nReproduced from the fac-simile given in Nordenskjöld’s _Studien_\r\n(Leipzig, 1885).]\r\n\r\nWe have run down the main feature of the northern cartography, up\r\nto the time of the publication of the Zeno map in 1558. The chief\r\nargument for its authenticity is that there had been nothing drawn and\r\npublished up to that time which could have conduced, without other aid,\r\nto so accurate an outline of Greenland as it gives. In an age when\r\ndrafts of maps freely circulated over Europe, from cartographer to\r\ncartographer, in manuscript, it does not seem necessary that the search\r\nfor prototypes or prototypic features should be confined to those which\r\nhad been engraved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZENO MAP. (_Reduced_.)\r\n\r\nThe original measures 12 × 15½ inches. Fac-similes of the original size\r\nor reduced, or other reproductions, will be found in Nordenskjöld’s\r\n_Trois Cartes_, and in his _Studien_; Malte Brun’s _Annales des\r\nVoyages_; Lelewel’s _Moyen Age_ (ii. 169); _Carter-Brown Catalogue_\r\n(i. 211); Kohl’s _Discovery of Maine_, 97; Ruge’s _Geschichte des\r\nZeitalters der Entdeckungen_, p. 27; Bancroft’s _Central America_,\r\ni. 81; Gay’s _Pop.

Hist.\r\nNewfoundland_, p. 45; Erizzo’s _Le Scoperte Artiche_ (Venice,\r\n1855),—not to name others.]\r\n\r\nWith these allowances the map does not seem to be very exceptional\r\nin any feature. It is connected with northwestern Europe in just the\r\nmanner appertaining to several of the earlier maps. Its shape is no\r\ngreat improvement on the map of 1467, found at Warsaw. There was\r\nthen no such constancy in the placing of mid-sea islands in maps, to\r\ninterdict the random location of other islands at the cartographer’s\r\nwill, without disturbing what at that day would have been deemed\r\ngeographical probabilities, and there was all the necessary warranty\r\nin existing maps for the most wilfully depicted archipelago. The early\r\nPortuguese charts, not to name others, gave sufficient warrant for land\r\nwhere Estotiland and Drogeo appear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PTOLEMY ALTERATION (1561, etc.) OF THE ZENO MAP.]\r\n\r\nMention has already been made of the changes in this map, which the\r\neditors of the Ptolemy of 1561 made in severing Greenland from Europe,\r\nwhen they reëngraved it.[777] The same edition contained a map of\r\n“Schonlandia,” in which it seems to be doubtful if the land which\r\nstands for Greenland does, or does not, connect with the Scandinavian\r\nmain.[778] That Greenland was an island seems now to have become the\r\nprevalent opinion, and it was enforced by the maps of Mercator (1569\r\nand 1587), Ortelius (1570, 1575), and Gallæus (1585), which placed\r\nit lying mainly east and west between the Scandinavian north and the\r\nLabrador coast, which it was now the fashion to call Estotiland. In its\r\nshape it closely resembled the Zeni outline. Another feature of these\r\nmaps was the placing of another but smaller island west of “Groenlant,”\r\nwhich was called “Grocland,” and which seems to be simply a\r\nreduplication of the larger island by some geographical confusion,[779]\r\nwhich once started was easily seized upon to help fill out the arctic\r\nspaces.[780]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEPTENTRIONALES REGIONES.\r\n\r\nFrom _Theatri orbis Terrarum Enchiridion, per Phillipum Gallæum, et per\r\nHugonem Favolium_ (Antwerp, 1585).]\r\n\r\nIt was just at this time (1570) that the oldest maps which display the\r\ngeographical notions of the saga men were drawn, though not brought to\r\nlight for many years. We note two such of this time, and one of a date\r\nnear forty years later. One marked “Jonas, Gudmundi filius, delineavit,\r\n1570,” is given as are the two others by Torfæus in his _Gronlandia\r\nAntiqua_. They all seem to recognize a passage to the Arctic seas\r\nbetween Norway and Greenland, the northern parts of which last are\r\ncalled “Risaland,” or “Riseland,” and Jonas places “Oster Bygd” and\r\n“Wester Bygd” on the opposite sides of a squarish peninsula. Beyond\r\nwhat must be Davis’ Straits is “America,” and further south “Terra\r\nFlorida” and “Albania.”\r\n\r\nIf this description is compared with the key of Stephanius’ map,\r\nnext to be mentioned, while we remember that both represent the views\r\nprevailing in the north in 1570, it is hard to resist the conclusion\r\nthat Vinland was north even of Davis’ Straits, or at least held to be\r\nso at that time.\r\n\r\nThe second map, that of Stephanius, is reproduced herewith, dating back\r\nto the same period (1570); but the third, by Gudbrandus Torlacius, was\r\nmade in 1606, and is sketched in Kohl’s _Discovery of Maine_ (p. 109).\r\nIt gives better shape to “Gronlandia” than in either of the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIGURD STEPHANIUS, 1570.\r\n\r\nReproduced from the _Saga Time_ of J. Fulford Vicary (London, 1887),\r\nafter the map as given in the publication of the geographical society\r\nat Copenhagen, 1885-86, and it is supposed to have been drafted upon\r\nthe narrative of the sagas. Key:\r\n\r\n“_A._ This is where the English have come and has a name for\r\nbarrenness, either from sun or cold.\r\n\r\n_B._ This is near where Vineland lies, which from its abundance of\r\nuseful things, or from the land’s fruitfulness, is called Good. Our\r\ncountrymen (Icelanders) have thought that to the south it ends with the\r\nwild sea and that a sound or fjord separates it from America.\r\n\r\n_C._ This land is called Rüseland or land of the giants, as they have\r\nhorns and are called Skrickfinna (Fins that frighten).\r\n\r\n_D._ This is more to the east, and the people are called Klofinna (Fins\r\nwith claws) on account of their large nails.\r\n\r\n_E._ This is Jotunheimer, or the home of the misshapen giants.\r\n\r\n_F._ Here is thought to be a fjord, or sound, leading to Russia.\r\n\r\n_G._ A rocky land often referred to in histories.\r\n\r\n_H._ What island that is I do not know, unless it be the island that a\r\nVenetian found, and the Germans call Friesland.”\r\n\r\nIt will be observed under the _B_ of the Key, the Norse of 1570 did not\r\nidentify the Vinland of 1000 with the America of later discoveries.\r\n\r\nThis map is much the same, but differs somewhat in detail, from the one\r\ncalled of Stephanius, as produced in Kohl’s _Discovery of Maine_, p.\r\n107, professedly after a copy given in Torfæus’ _Gronlandia Antiqua_\r\n(1706). Torfæus quotes Theodorus Torlacius, the Icelandic historian,\r\nas saying that Stephanius appears to have drawn his map from ancient\r\nIcelandic records. The other maps given by Torfæus are: by Bishop\r\nGudbrand Thorlakssen (1606); by Jonas Gudmund (1640); by Theodor\r\nThorlakssen (1666), and by Torfæus himself. Cf. other copies of the map\r\nof Stephanius in Malte-Brun’s _Annales des Voyages, Weise’s Discoveries\r\nof America_, p. 22; _Geog. Tidskrift_, viii. 123, and in Horsford’s\r\n_Disc. of America by Northmen_, p. 37.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to follow the course of the Greenland cartography\r\nfarther with any minuteness. As the sixteenth century ended we have\r\nleading maps by Hakluyt in 1587 and 1599 (see Vol. III. 42), and De\r\nBry in 1596 (Vol. IV. 99), and Wytfliet in 1597, all of which give\r\nDavis’s Straits with more or less precision. Barentz’s map of 1598\r\nbecame the exemplar of the circumpolar chart in Pontanus’ _Rerum et\r\nUrbis Amstelodamensium Historia_ of 1611.[781] The chart of Luke Fox,\r\nin 1635, marked progress[782] better than that of La Peyrère (1647),\r\nthough his map was better known.[783] Even as late as 1727, Hermann\r\nMoll could not identify his “Greenland” with “Groenland.” In 1741,\r\nwe have the map of Hans Egede in his “Grönland,” repeated in late\r\neditions, and the old delineation of the east coast after Torfæus was\r\nstill retained in the 1788 map of Paul Egede.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KORT _over_ GRÖNLAND _Den östre Süde efter Torfæus\r\nDen vestre Süde aflagt og forbedret i Sammenligning med de senere\r\nEfterretninger af Paul Egede_\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The annexed map is a reduced fac-simile of the map in the\r\n_Efterretninger om Grönland uddragne af en Journal holden fra 1771\r\ntil 1788_, by Paul Egede (Copenhagen, 1789). Paul Egede, son of Hans,\r\nwas born in 1708, and remained in Greenland till 1740. He was made\r\nBishop of Greenland in 1770, and died in 1789. The above book gives\r\na portrait. There is another fac-simile of the map in Nordenskjöld’s\r\n_Exped. till Grönland_, p. 234.]\r\n\r\nIn the map of 1653, made by De la Martinière, who was of the Danish\r\nexpedition to the north, Greenland was made to connect with Northern\r\nAsia by way of the North pole.[784] Nordenskjöld calls him the\r\nMünchhausen of the northeast voyagers; and by his own passage in the\r\n“Vega,” along the northern verge of Europe, from one ocean to the\r\nother, the Swedish navigator has of recent years proved for the first\r\ntime that Greenland has no such connection. It yet remains to be proved\r\nthat there is no connection to the north with at least the group of\r\nislands that are the arctic outlyers of the American continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREENLAND.\r\n\r\nExtracted from the “Carte de Grœnland” in Isaac de la Peyrère’s\r\n_Relation du Groenland_ (Paris, 1647).

Who they were, whence\r\nthey came, and what stands for their descendants after we get down\r\nto what in this pre-Spanish history we rather presumptuously call\r\nhistoric ground, is far from clear. If we had the easy faith of the\r\nnative historian Ixtlilxochitl, we should believe that these gigantic\r\nQuinames, or Quinametin, were for the most part swallowed up in a great\r\nconvulsion of nature, and it was those who escaped which the Olmecs\r\nand Tlascalans encountered in entering the country.[788] If all this\r\nmeans anything, which may well be doubted, it is as likely as not\r\nthat these giants were the followers of a demi-god, Votan,[789] who\r\ncame from over-sea to America,[790] found it peopled, established a\r\ngovernment in Xibalba,—if such a place ever existed,—with the germs\r\nof Maya if not of other civilizations, whence, by migrations during\r\nsucceeding times, the Votanites spread north and occupied the Mexican\r\nplateau, where they became degenerate, doubtless, if they deserved\r\nthe extinction which we are told was in store for them. But they\r\nhad an alleged chronicler for their early days, the writer of the\r\nBook of Votan, written either by the hero himself or by one of his\r\ndescendants,—eight or nine generations in the range of authorship\r\nmaking little difference apparently. That this narrative was known to\r\nFrancisco Nuñez de la Vega[791] would seem to imply that somebody at\r\nthat time had turned it into readable script out of the unreadable\r\nhieroglyphics, while the disguises of the Spanish tongue, perhaps, as\r\nBancroft[792] suggests, may have saved it from the iconoclastic zeal of\r\nthe priests. When, later, Ramon de Ordoñez had the document,—perhaps\r\nthe identical manuscript,—it consisted of a few folios of quarto\r\npaper, and was written in Roman script in the Tzendal tongue, and was\r\ninspected by Cabrera, who tells us something of its purport in his\r\n_Teatro critico Americano_, while Ramon himself was at the same time\r\nusing it in his _Historia del Cielo y de la Tierra_. It was from a\r\nlater copy of this last essay, the first copy being unknown, that the\r\nAbbé Brasseur de Bourbourg got his knowledge of what Ramon had derived\r\nfrom the Votan narrative, and which Brasseur has given us in several\r\nof his books.[793] That there was a primitive empire—Votanic, if you\r\nplease—seems to some minds confirmed by other evidences than the story\r\nof Votan; and out of this empire—to adopt a European nomenclature—have\r\ncome, as such believers say, after its downfall somewhere near the\r\nChristian era, and by divergence, the great stocks of people called\r\nMaya, Quiché, and Nahua, inhabiting later, and respectively, Yucatan,\r\nGuatemala, and Mexico. This is the view, if we accept the theory which\r\nBancroft has prominently advocated, that the migrations of the Nahuas\r\nwere from the south northward,[794] and that this was the period of the\r\ndivergence, eighteen centuries ago or more, of the great civilizing\r\nstocks of Mexico and of Central America.[795] We fail to find so early\r\na contact of these two races, if, on the other hand, we accept the\r\nold theory that the migrations which established the Toltec and Aztec\r\npowers were from the north southward,[796] through three several lines,\r\nas is sometimes held, one on each side of the Rocky Mountains, with a\r\nthird following the coast. In this way such advocates trace the course\r\nof the Olmecs, who encountered the giants, and later of the Toltecs.\r\n\r\nThat the Votanic peoples or some other ancient tribes were then a\r\ndistinct source of civilization, and that Palenqué may even be Xibalba,\r\nor the Nachan, which Votan founded, is a belief that some archæologists\r\nfind the evidence of in certain radical differences in the Maya tongues\r\nand in the Maya ruins.[797]\r\n\r\nIn the Quiché traditions, as preserved in the _Popul Vuh_, and in\r\nthe _Annals of the Cakchiquels_, we likewise go back into mistiness\r\nand into the inevitable myths which give the modern comparative\r\nmythologists so much comfort and enlightenment; but Bancroft[798] and\r\nthe rest get from all this nebulousness, as was gotten from the Maya\r\ntraditions, that there was a great power at Xibalba,[799]—if in Central\r\nAmerica anywhere that place may have been,—which was overcome[800]\r\nwhen from Tulan[801] went out migrating chiefs, who founded the\r\nQuiché-Cakchiquel peoples of Guatemala, while others, the Yaqui,—very\r\nlikely only traders,—went to Mexico, and still others went to Yucatan,\r\nthus accounting for the subsequent great centres of aboriginal power—if\r\nwe accept this view.\r\n\r\nAs respects the traditions of the more northern races, there is the\r\nsame choice of belief and alternative demonstration. The Olmecs, the\r\nearliest Nahua corners, are sometimes spoken of as sailing from Florida\r\nand landing on the coast at what is now Pánuco, whence they travelled\r\nto Guatemala,[802] and finally settled in Tamoanchan, and offered their\r\nsacrifices farther north at Teotihuacan.[803] This is very likely the\r\nVotan legend suited to the more northern region, and if so, it serves\r\nto show, unless we discard the whole theory, how the Votanic people had\r\nscattered. The other principal source of our suppositions—for we can\r\nhardly call it knowledge—of these times is the _Codex Chimalpòpoca_,\r\nof which there is elsewhere an account,[804] and from it we can derive\r\nmuch the same impressions, if we are disposed to sustain a preconceived\r\nnotion.\r\n\r\nThe periods and succession of the races whose annals make up the\r\nhistory of what we now call Mexico, prior to the coming of the\r\nSpaniards, are confused and debatable. Whether under the name of\r\nChichimecs we are to understand a distinct people, or a varied and\r\nconglomerate mass of people, which, in a generic way, we might call\r\nbarbarians, is a question open to discussion.[805] There is no lack\r\nof names[806] to be applied to the tribes and bands which, according\r\nto all accounts, occupied the Mexican territory previous to the sixth\r\ncentury. Some of them were very likely Nahua forerunners[807] of the\r\nsubsequent great influx of that race, like the Olmecs and Xicalancas,\r\nand may have been the people, “from the direction of Florida,” of\r\nwhom mention has been made. Others, as some say, were eddies of those\r\npopulous waves which, coming by the north from Asia, overflowed the\r\nRocky Mountains, and became the builders of mounds and the later\r\npeoples of the Mississippi Valley,[808] passed down the trend of the\r\nRocky Mountains, and built cliff-houses and pueblos, or streamed into\r\nthe table-land of Mexico. This is all conjecture, perhaps delusion,\r\nbut may be as good a supposition as any, if we agree to the northern\r\ntheory, as Nadaillac[809] does, but not so tenable, if, with the\r\ncontrary Bancroft,[810] we hold rather that they came from the south.\r\nWe can turn from one to the other of these theorists and agree with\r\nboth, as they cite their evidences. On the whole, a double compliance\r\nis better than dogmatism. It is one thing to lose one’s way in this\r\nlabyrinth of belief, and another to lose one’s head.\r\n\r\nIt was the Olmecs who found the Quinames, or giants, near Puebla and\r\nCholula, and in the end overcame them. The Olmecs built, according\r\nto one story, the great pyramid of Cholula,[811] and it was they who\r\nreceived the great Quetzalcoatl from across the sea, a white-bearded\r\nman, as the legends went, who was benign enough, in the stories told\r\nof him, to make the later Spaniards think, when they heard them, that\r\nhe was no other than the Christian St. Thomas on his missions. When\r\nthe Spaniards finally induced the inheritors of the Olmecs’ power to\r\nworship Quetzalcoatl as a beneficent god, his temple soon topped the\r\nmound at Cholula.[812] We have seen that the great Nahua occupation\r\nof the Mexican plateau, at a period somewhere from the fourth to\r\nthe seventh century,[813] was preceded by some scattered tribal\r\norganizations of the same stock, which had at an early date mingled\r\nwith the primitive peoples of this region. We have seen that there is\r\na diversity of opinion as to the country from which they came, whether\r\nfrom the north or south. A consideration of this question involves the\r\nwhole question of the migration of races in these pre-Columbian days,\r\nsince it is the coming and going of peoples that form the basis of all\r\nits history.\r\n\r\nIn the study of these migrations, we find no more unanimity of\r\ninterpretation than in other questions of these early times.[814]\r\nThe Nahua peoples (Toltecs, Aztecs, Mexicans, or what you will),\r\naccording to the prevalent views of the early Spanish writers, came\r\nby successive influxes from the north or northwest, and from a remote\r\nplace called Tollan, Tula, Tlapallan, Huehue-Tlapallan, as respects the\r\nToltec group,[815] and called Aztlan as respects the Aztec or Mexican.\r\nWhen, by settlement after settlement, each migratory people pushed\r\nfarther south, they finally reached Central Mexico. This sequence of\r\nimmigration seems to be agreed upon, but as to where their cradle\r\nwas and as to what direction their line of progress took, there is\r\na diversity of opinion as widely separated as the north is from the\r\nsouth. The northern position and the southern direction is all but\r\nuniversally accepted among the early Spanish writers[816] and their\r\nfollowers,[817] while it is claimed by others that the traditions as\r\npreserved point to the south as the starting-point. Cabrera took this\r\nview. Brasseur sought to reconcile conflicting tradition and Spanish\r\nstatement by carrying the line of migration from the south with a\r\nnortherly sweep, so that in the end Anahuac would be entered from the\r\nnorth, with which theory Bancroft[818] is inclined to agree. Aztlan, as\r\nwell as Huehue-Tlapallan, by those who support the northern theory, has\r\nbeen placed anywhere from the California peninsula[819] within a radius\r\nthat sweeps through Wisconsin and strikes the Atlantic at Florida.[820]\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the southern starting-point of these migrations have\r\nbeen comparatively few and of recent prominence; chief among them are\r\nSquier and Bancroft.[821]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of a people, which, for want of a better\r\ndesignation, are usually termed Toltecs, on the Mexican table-land in\r\nthe sixth century or thereabouts,[822] we begin the early history of\r\nMexico, so far as we can make any deductions from the semi-mythical\r\nrecords and traditions which the Spaniards or the later aborigines\r\nhave preserved for us. This story of the Nahua occupation of Anáhuac\r\nis one of strife and shifting vassalage, with rivalries and uprisings\r\nof neighboring and kindred tribes, going on for centuries. While the\r\nmore advanced portion of the Nahuas in Anáhuac were making progress\r\nin the arts, that division of the same stock which was living beyond\r\nsuch influence, and without the bounds of Anáhuac, were looked upon\r\nrather as barbarians than as brothers, and acquired the name which had\r\nbecome a general one for such rougher natures, Chichimec. It is this\r\nChichimec people under some name or other who are always starting up\r\nand overturning something. At one time they unite with the Colhuas and\r\nfound Colhuacan, and nearly subjugate the lake region. Then the Toltec\r\ntarriers at Huehue-Tlapallan come boldly to the neighborhood of the\r\nChichimecs and found Tollan; and thus they turn a wandering community\r\ninto what, for want of a better name, is called a monarchy. They\r\nstrengthened its government by an alliance with the Chichimecs,[823]\r\nand placed their seat of power at Colhuacan.\r\n\r\nThen we read of a power springing up at Tezcuco, and of various\r\nother events, which happened or did not happen, according as you\r\nbelieve this or the other chronicle. The run of many of the stories\r\nof course produces the inevitable and beautiful daughter, and the\r\nbold princess, who control many an event. Then there is a league\r\nof Colhuacan, Otompan, and Tollan. Suddenly appears the great king\r\nQuetzalcoatl,—though it may be we confound him with the divinity of\r\nthat name; and with him, to perplex matters, comes his sworn enemy\r\nHuemac. Quetzalcoatl’s devoted labors to make his people give up human\r\nsacrifice arrayed the priesthood against him, until at last he fell\r\nbefore the intrigues that made Huemac succeed in Tollan, and that drove\r\nhis luckless rival to Cholula, where he reigned anew. Huemac followed\r\nhim and drove him farther; but in doing so he gave his enemies in\r\nTollan a chance to put another on the throne.\r\n\r\nThen came a season of peace and development, when Tollan grew splendid.\r\nColhuacan flourished in political power, and Teotihuacan[824] and\r\nCholula were the religious shrines of the people. But at last the end\r\nwas near.\r\n\r\nThe closing century of the Toltec power was a frightful one for\r\nbroil, pestilence, and famine among the people, amours and revenge\r\nin the great chieftain’s household, revolt among the vassals; with\r\nsorcery rampant and the gods angry; with volcanoes belching, summers\r\nlike a furnace, and winters like the pole; with the dreaded omen of\r\na rabbit, horned like a deer, confronting the ruler, while rebel\r\nforces threatened the capital. There was also civil strife within the\r\ngates, phallic worship and debauchery,—all preceding an inundation of\r\nChichimecan hordes. Thus the power that had flourished for several\r\nhundred years fell,—seemingly in the latter half of the eleventh\r\ncentury.[825] The remnant that was left of the desolated people went\r\nhither and thither, till the fragments were absorbed in the conquerors,\r\nor migrated to distant regions south.[826]\r\n\r\nWhether the term Toltec signified a nation, or only denoted a dynasty,\r\nis a question for the archæologists to determine. The general opinion\r\nheretofore has been that they were a distinct race, of the Nahua stock,\r\nhowever, and that they came from the north. The story which has been\r\nthus far told of their history is the narrative of Ixtlilxochitl, and\r\nis repeated by Veytia, Clavigero, Prescott, Brasseur de Bourbourg,\r\nOrozco y Berra, Nadaillac, and the later compilers. Sahagún seems to\r\nhave been the first to make a distinct use of the name Toltec, and\r\nCharency in his paper on _Xibalba_ finds evidence that the Toltecs\r\nconstituted two different migrations, the one of a race that was\r\nstraight-headed, which came from the northwest, and the other of a\r\nflat-headed people, which came from Florida.\r\n\r\nBrinton, on the contrary, finds no warrant either for this dual\r\nmigration, or indeed for considering the Toltecs to be other than a\r\nsection of the same race, that we know later as Aztecs or Mexicans.\r\nThis sweeping denial of their ethnical independence had been\r\nforestalled by Gallatin;[827] but no one before Brinton had made it a\r\ndistinct issue, though some writers before and since have verged on his\r\nviews.[828] Others, like Charnay, have answered Brinton’s arguments,\r\nand defended the older views.[829] Bandelier’s views connect them with\r\nthe Maya rather than with the Nahua stock,[830] if, as he thinks may\r\nbe the case, they were the people who landed at Pánuco and settled at\r\nTamoanchan, the Votanites, as they are sometimes called. He traces back\r\nto Herrera and Torquemada the identification for the first time of the\r\nToltecs with these people.[831] Bandelier’s conclusions, however, are\r\nthat “all we can gather about them with safety is, that they were a\r\nsedentary Indian stock, which at some remote period settled in Central\r\nMexico,” and that “nothing certain is known of their language.”[832]\r\n\r\nThe desolation of Anáhuac as the Toltecs fell invited a foreign\r\noccupation, and a remote people called Chichimecs[833]—not to\r\nbe confounded with the primitive barbarians which are often so\r\ncalled—poured down upon the country. Just how long after the Toltec\r\ndownfall this happened, is in dispute;[834] but within a few years\r\nevidently, perhaps within not many months, came the rush of millions,\r\nif we may believe the big stories of the migration. They surged by the\r\nruined capital of the Toltecs, came to the lake, founded Xoloc and\r\nTenayocan, and encountered, as they spread over the country, what were\r\nleft of the Toltecs, who secured peace by becoming vassals. Not quite\r\nso humble were the Colhuas of Colhuacan,—not to be confounded with the\r\nAcolhuas,—who were the most powerful section of the Toltecs yet left,\r\nand the Chichimecs set about crushing them, and succeeded in making\r\nthem also vassals.[835] The Chichimec monarchs, if that term does not\r\nmisrepresent them, soon formed alliances with the Tepanecs, the Otomis,\r\nand the Acolhuas, who had been prominent in the overthrow of the\r\nToltecs, and all the invaders profited by the higher organizations and\r\narts which these tribes had preserved and now imparted. The Chichimecs\r\nalso sought to increase the stability of their power by marriages with\r\nthe noble Toltecs still remaining. But all was not peace. There were\r\nrebellions from time to time to be put down; and a new people, whose\r\nfuture they did not then apprehend, had come in among them and settled\r\nat Chapultepec. These were the Aztecs, or Mexicans, a part of the great\r\nNahua immigration, but as a tribe they had dallied behind the others on\r\nthe way, but were now come, and the last to come.[836]\r\n\r\nTezcuco soon grew into prominence as a vassal power,[837] and upon\r\nthe capital city many embellishments were bestowed, so that the great\r\nlord of the Chichimecs preferred it to his own Tenayocan, which\r\ngave opportunity for rebellious plots to be formed in his proper\r\ncapital; and here at Tezcuco the next succeeding ruler preferred to\r\nreign, and here he became isolated by the uprising of rebellious\r\nnobles. The ensuing war was not simply of side against side, but\r\ncounter-revolutions led to a confusion of tumults, and petty chieftains\r\nset themselves up against others here and there. The result was that\r\nQuinantzin, who had lost the general headship of the country, recovered\r\nit, and finally consolidated his power to a degree surpassing all his\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLAVIGERO’S MEXICO.[838] (Ed. of 1780, vol. iii.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLAVIGERO’S MAP. (Ed. of 1580, vol. i.)\r\n\r\nClavigero speaks of his map “per servire all storia antica del\r\nMessico.” A map of the Aztec dominion just before the Conquest is given\r\nin Ranking (London, 1827). See note in Vol. II. p. 358.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Aztecs at Chapultepec, growing arrogant, provoked\r\ntheir neighbors, and were repressed by those who were more powerful.\r\nBut they abided their time. They were good fighters, and the Colhua\r\nruler courted them to assist him in his maraudings, and thus they were\r\nbecoming accustomed to warfare and to conquest, and were giving favors\r\nto be repaid. This intercourse, whether of association or rivalry, of\r\nthe Colhuas and Mexicans (Aztecs), was continued through succeeding\r\nperiods, with a confusion of dates and events which it is hard to make\r\nclear. There was mutual distrust and confidence alternately, and it\r\nall ended in the Aztecs settling on an island in the lake, where later\r\nthey founded Tenochtitlan, or Mexico.[839] Here they developed those\r\nbloody rites of sacrifice which had already disgusted their allies and\r\nneighbors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LAKE OF MEXICO.\r\n\r\nA map which did service in different forms in various books about\r\nMexico and its aboriginal localities in the early part of the\r\neighteenth century. It is here taken from the _Voyages de Francois\r\nCoreal_ (Amsterdam, 1722).]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the powers at Colhuacan and Azcapuzalco flourished and\r\nrepressed uprisings, and out of all the strife Tezozomoc came into\r\nprominence with his Tepanecs, and amid it all the Aztecs, siding here\r\nand there, gained territory. With all this occurring in different parts\r\nof his dominions, the Chichimec potentate grew stronger and stronger,\r\nand while by his countenance the old Toltec influences more and more\r\npredominated. And so it was a flourishing government, with little to\r\nmar its prospects but the ambition of Tezozomoc, the Tepanec chieftain,\r\nand the rising power of the Aztecs, who had now become divided into\r\nMexicans and Tlatelulcas. The famous ruler of the Chichimecs, Techotl,\r\ndied in A.D. 1357, and the young Ixtlilxochitl took his power with\r\nall its emblems. The people of Tenochtitlan, or their rulers, were\r\nadepts in practising those arts of diplomacy by which an ambitious\r\nnation places itself beside its superiors to secure a sort of reflected\r\nconsequence. Thus they pursued matrimonial alliances and other acts of\r\nprudence. Both Tenochtitlan and its neighbor Tlatelulco grew apace,\r\nwhile skilled artisans and commercial industries helped to raise them\r\nin importance.\r\n\r\nThe young Ixtlilxochitl at Tezcuco was not so fortunate, and it\r\nsoon looked as if the Tepanec prince, Tezozomoc, was only waiting an\r\nopportunity to rebel. It was also pretty clear that he would have the\r\naid of Mexico and Tlatelulco, and that he would succeed in securing the\r\nsympathy of many wavering vassals or allies. The plans of the Tepanec\r\nchieftain at last ripened, and he invaded the Tezcucan territory in\r\n1415. In the war which followed, Ixtlilxochitl reversed the tide and\r\ninvaded the Tepanec territory, besieging and capturing its capital,\r\nAzcapuzalco.[840] The conqueror lost by his clemency what he had gained\r\nby arms, and it was not long before he was in turn shut up in his own\r\ncapital. He did not succeed in defending it, and was at last killed.\r\nSo Tezozomoc reached his vantage of ambition, and was now in his old\r\nage the lord paramount of the country. He tried to harmonize the varied\r\nelements of his people; but the Mexicans had not fared in the general\r\nsuccesses as they had hoped for, and were only openly content. The\r\ndeath of Tezozomoc prepared the way for one of his sons, Maxtla, to\r\nseize the command, and the vassal lords soon found that the spirit\r\nwhich had murdered a brother had aims that threatened wider desolation.\r\nThe Mexicans were the particular object of Maxtla’s oppressive spirit,\r\nand by the choice of Itzcoatl for their ruler, who had been for many\r\nyears the Mexican war-chief, that people defied the lord of all, and\r\nin this they were joined by the Tlatelulcas under Quauhtlatohuatzin,\r\nand by lesser allies. Under this combination of his enemies Maxtla’s\r\ncapital fell, the usurper was sacrificed, and the honors of the victory\r\nwere shared by Itzcoatl, Nezahualcoyotl (the Acolhuan prince whose\r\nimperial rights Maxtla had usurped), and Montezuma, the first of the\r\nname,—all who had in their several capacities led the army of three\r\nor four hundred thousand allies, if we may believe the figures, to\r\ntheir successes, which occurred apparently somewhere between 1425 and\r\n1430. The political result was a tripartite confederacy in Anáhuac,\r\nconsisting of Acolhua, Mexico, and Tlacopan. In the division of spoils,\r\nthe latter was to have one fifth, and the others two fifths each, the\r\nAcolhuan prince presiding in their councils as senior.[841]\r\n\r\nThe next hundred years is a record of the increasing power of\r\nthis confederacy, with a constant tendency to give Mexico a larger\r\ninfluence.[842] The two capitals, Tenochtitlan and Tezcuco, looking at\r\neach other across the lake, were uninterruptedly growing in splendor,\r\nor in what the historians call by that word,[843] with all the adjuncts\r\nof public works,—causeways, canals, aqueducts, temples, palaces and\r\ngardens, and other evidences of wealth, which perhaps these modern\r\nterms only approximately represent. Tezcuco was taken possession of by\r\nNezahualcoyotl as his ancient inheritance, and his confederate Itzcoatl\r\nplaced the crown on his head. Together they made war north and south.\r\nXochimilco, on the lake next south of Mexico, yielded; and the people\r\nof Chalco, which was on the most southern of the string of lakes,\r\nrevolted and were suppressed more than once, as opportunities offered.\r\nThe confederates crossed the ridge that formed the southern bound of\r\nthe Mexican valley and sacked Quauhnahuac. The Mexican ruler had in\r\nall this gained a certain ascendency in the valley coalition, when he\r\ndied in 1440, and his nephew, Montezuma the soldier, and first of the\r\nname,[844] succeeded him. This prince soon had on his hands another war\r\nwith Chalco, and with the aid of his confederates he finally humbled\r\nits presumptuous people. So, with or without pretence, the wars and\r\nconquests went on, if for no other reasons, to obtain prisoners for\r\nsacrifice.[845] They were diversified at times, particularly in 1449,\r\nby contests with the powers of nature, when the rising waters of the\r\nlake threatened to drown their cities, and when, one evil being cured,\r\nothers in the shape of famine and plague succeeded.\r\n\r\nSometimes in the wars the confederates over-calculated their own\r\nprowess, as when Atonaltzin of Tilantongo sent them reeling back, only,\r\nhowever, to make better preparations and to succeed at last. In another\r\nwar to the southeast they captured, as the accounts say, over six\r\nthousand victims for the stone of sacrifice.\r\n\r\nThe first Montezuma died in 1469, and the choice for succession fell\r\non his grandson, the commander of the Mexican army, Axayacatl, who at\r\nonce followed the usual custom of raiding the country to the south\r\nto get the thousands of prisoners whose sacrifice should grace his\r\ncoronation. Nezahualcoyotl, the other principal allied chieftain,\r\nsurvived his associate but two years, dying in 1472, leaving among\r\nhis hundred children but one legitimate son, Nezahualpilli, a minor,\r\nwho succeeded. This gave the new Mexican ruler the opportunity to\r\nincrease his power. He made Tlatelulco tributary, and a Mexican\r\ngovernor took the place there of an independent sovereign. He annexed\r\nthe Matlaltzinca provinces on the west. So Axayacatl, dying in 1481,\r\nbequeathed an enlarged kingdom to his brother and successor, Tizoc,\r\nwho has not left so warlike a record. According to some authorities,\r\nhowever, he is to be credited with the completion of the great Mexican\r\ntemple of Huitzilopochtli. This did not save him from assassination,\r\nand his brother Ahuitzotl in 1486 succeeded, and to him fell the lot\r\nof dedicating that great temple. He conducted fresh wars vigorously\r\nenough to be able within a year, if we may believe the native records,\r\nto secure sixty or seventy thousand captives for the sacrificial\r\nstone, so essential a part of all such dedicatory exercises. It would\r\nbe tedious to enumerate all the succeeding conquests, though varied\r\nby some defeats, like that which they experienced in the Tehuantepec\r\nregion. Some differences grew up, too, between the Mexican chieftain\r\nand Nezahualpilli, notwithstanding or because of the virtues of the\r\nlatter, among which doubtless, according to the prevailing standard, we\r\nmust count his taking at once three Mexican princesses for wives, and\r\nhis keeping a harem of over two thousand women, if we may believe his\r\ndescendant, the historian Ixtlilxochitl. His justice as an arbitrary\r\nmonarch is mentioned as exemplary, and his putting to death a guilty\r\nson is recounted as proof of it.\r\n\r\nAhuitzotl had not as many virtues, or perhaps he had not a descendant\r\nto record them so effectively; but when he died in 1503, what there was\r\nheroic in his nature was commemorated in his likeness sculptured with\r\nothers of his line on the cliff of Chapultepec.[846] To him succeeded\r\nthat Montezuma, son of Axayacatl, with whom later this ancient history\r\nvanishes. When he came to power, the Aztec name was never significant\r\nof more lordly power, though the confederates had already had some\r\nreminders that conquest near home was easier than conquest far away.\r\nThe policy of the last Aztec ruler was far from popular, and while\r\nhe propitiated the higher ranks, he estranged the people. The hopes\r\nof the disaffected within and without Anáhuac were now centred in\r\nthe Tlascalans, whose territory lay easterly towards the Gulf of\r\nMexico, and who had thus far not felt the burden of Aztec oppression.\r\nNotwithstanding that their natural allies, the Cholulans, turned\r\nagainst the Tlascalans, the Aztec armies never succeeded in humbling\r\nthem, as they did the Mistecs and the occupants of the region towards\r\nthe Pacific. Eclipses, earthquakes, and famine soon succeeded one\r\nanother, and the forebodings grew numerous. Hardly anything happened\r\nbut the omens of disaster[847] were seen in it, and superstition\r\nbegan to do its work of enervation, while a breach between Montezuma\r\nand the Tezcucan chief was a bad augury. In this condition of things\r\nthe Mexican king tried to buoy his hopes by further conquests; but\r\nwidespread as these invasions were, Michoacan to the west, and Tlascala\r\nto the east, always kept their independence. The Zapotecs in Oajaca\r\nhad at one time succumbed, but this was before the days of the last\r\nMontezuma.\r\n\r\nHis rival across the lake at Tezcuco was more oppressed with the tales\r\nof the soothsayers than Montezuma was, and seems to have become inert\r\nbefore what he thought an impending doom some time before he died, or,\r\nas his people believed, before he had been translated to the ancient\r\nAmaquemecan, the cradle of his race. This was in 1515. His son Cacama\r\nwas chosen to succeed; but a younger brother, Ixtlilxochitl, believed\r\nthat the choice was instigated by Montezuma for ulterior gain, and so\r\nbegan a revolt in the outlying provinces, in which he received the aid\r\nof Tlascala. The appearance of the Spaniards on the coasts of Yucatan\r\nand Tabasco, of which exaggerated reports reached the Mexican capital,\r\nparalyzed Montezuma, so that the northern revolt succeeded, and Cacama\r\nand Ixtlilxochitl came to an understanding, which left the Mexicans\r\nwithout much exterior support. Montezuma was in this crippled condition\r\nwhen his lookouts on the coast sent him word that the dreaded Spaniards\r\nhad appeared, and he could recognize their wonderful power in the\r\npictured records which the messenger bore to him.[848] This portent\r\nwas the visit in 1518 of Juan de Grijalva to the spot where Vera Cruz\r\nnow stands; and after the Spaniard sailed away, there were months of\r\nanxiety before word again reached the capital, in 1519, of another\r\narrival of the white-winged vessels, and this was the coming of Cortés,\r\nwho was not long in discovering that the path of his conquest was made\r\nclear by the current belief that he was the returned Quetzalcoatl,[849]\r\nand by his quick perception of the opportunity which presented itself\r\nof combining and leading the enemies of Montezuma.[850]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong what are usually reckoned the civilized nations of middle\r\nAmerica, there are two considerable centres of a dim history that have\r\nlittle relation with the story which has been thus far followed. One\r\nof these is that of the people of what we now call Guatemala, and the\r\nother that of Yucatan. The political society which existed in Guatemala\r\nhad nothing of the known duration assigned to the more northern people,\r\nat least not in essential data; but we know of it simply as a very\r\nmeagre and perplexing chronology running for the most part back two\r\nor three centuries only. Whether the beginnings of what we suppose we\r\nknow of these people have anything to do with any Toltec migration\r\nsouthward is what archæologists dispute about, and the philologists\r\nseem to have the best of the argument in the proof that the tongue of\r\nthese southern peoples is more like Maya than Nahua. It is claimed that\r\nthe architectural remains of Guatemala indicate a departure from the\r\nMaya stock and some alliance with a foreign stock; and that this alien\r\ninfluence was Nahuan seems probable enough when we consider certain\r\nsimilarities in myth and tradition of the Nahuas and the Quichés. But\r\nwe have not much even of tradition and myth of the early days, except\r\nwhat we my read in the _Popul Vuh_, where we may make out of it what\r\nwe can, or even what we please,[851] with some mysterious connection\r\nwith Votan and Xibalba. Among the mythical traditions of this mythical\r\nperiod, there are the inevitable migration stories, beginning with\r\nthe Quichés and ending with the coming of the Cakchiquels, but no one\r\nknows to a surety when. The new-comers found Maya-speaking people, and\r\ncalled them mem or memes (stutterers), because they spoke the Maya so\r\ndifferently from themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was in the twelfth or thirteenth century that we get the first\r\ntraces of any historical kind of the Quichés and of their rivals the\r\nCakchiquels. Of their early rulers we have the customary diversities\r\nand inconsistencies in what purports to be their story, and it is\r\ndifficult to say whether this or the other or some other tribe\r\nrevolted, conquered, or were beaten, as we read the annals of this\r\nconstant warfare. We meet something tangible, however, when we learn\r\nthat Montezuma sent a messenger, who informed the Quichés of the\r\npresence of the Spaniards in his capital, which set them astir to be\r\nprepared in their turn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP IN BRASSEUR’S POPUL VUH.]\r\n\r\nIt is in the beginning of the sixteenth century that we encounter the\r\nrivalries of three prominent peoples in this Guatemala country, and\r\nthese were the Quichés, the Cakchiquels, and the Zutigils; and of these\r\nthe Quichés, with their main seat at Utatlan, were the most powerful,\r\nthough not so much so but the Cakchiquels could get the best of them at\r\ntimes in the wager of war; as they did also finally when the Spaniard\r\nAlvarado appeared, with whom the Cakchiquels entered into an alliance\r\nthat brought the Quichés into sore straits.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA more important nationality attracts us in the Mayas of Yucatan.\r\nThere can be nothing but vague surmise as to what were the primitive\r\ninhabitants of this region; but it seems to be tolerably clear that\r\na certain homogeneousness pervaded the people, speaking one tongue,\r\nwhich the Spaniards found in possession. Whether these had come from\r\nthe northern regions, and were migrated Toltecs, as some believe, is\r\nopen to discussion.[852] It has often been contended that they were\r\noriginally of the Nahua and Toltec blood; but later writers, like\r\nBancroft,[853] have denied it. Brinton discards the Toltec element\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nWhat by a license one may call history begins back with the\r\nsemi-mythical Zamná, to whom all good things are ascribed—the\r\nintroduction of the Maya institutions and of the Maya\r\nhieroglyphics.[854] Whether Zamná had any connection, shadowy or real,\r\nwith the great Votanic demi-god, and with the establishment of the\r\nXibalban empire, if it may be so called, is a thing to be asserted or\r\ndenied, as one inclines to separate or unite the traditions of Yucatan\r\nwith those of the Tzendal, Quiché, and Toltec. Ramon de Ordonez, in a\r\nspirit of vagary, tells us that Mayapan, the great city of the early\r\nMayas, was but one of the group of centres, with Palenqué, Tulan, and\r\nCopan for the rest, as is believed, which made up the Votanic empire.\r\nPerhaps it was. If we accept Brinton’s view, it certainly was not. Then\r\nTorquemada and Landa tell us that Cukulcan, a great captain and a god,\r\nwas but another Quetzalcoatl, or Gucumatz. Perhaps he was. Possibly\r\nalso he was the bringer of Nahua influence to Mayapan, away back in a\r\nperiod corresponding to the early centuries of the Christian era. It\r\nis easy to say, in all this confusion, this is proved and that is not.\r\nThe historian, accustomed to deal with palpable evidence, feels much\r\ninclined to leave all views in abeyance.\r\n\r\nThe Cocomes of Yucatan history were Cukulcan’s descendants or\r\nfollowers, and had a prosperous history, as we are told; and there came\r\nto live among them the Totul Xius, by some considered a Maya people,\r\nwho like the Quichés had been subjected to Nahua influences, and who\r\nimplanted in the monuments and institutions of Yucatan those traces of\r\nNahua character which the archæologists discover.[855] The Totul Xius\r\nare placed in Uxmal in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries,\r\nwhere they flourished along with the Cocomes, and it is to them that\r\nit is claimed many of the ruins which now interest us in Yucatan can\r\nbe traced, though some of them perhaps go back to Zamná and to the\r\nXibalban period, or at least it would be hard to prove otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the Cocome chieftains began to oppress their subjects, the\r\nTotul Xius gave them shelter, and finally assisted them in a revolt,\r\nwhich succeeded and made Uxmal the supreme city, and Mayapan became a\r\nruin, or at least was much neglected. The dynasty of the Totul Xius\r\nthen flourished, but was in its turn overthrown, and a period of\r\nfactions and revolutions followed, during which Mayapan was wholly\r\nobliterated, and the Totul Xius settled in Mani, where the Spaniards\r\nfound them when they invaded Yucatan to make an easy conquest of a\r\ndivided people.[856]\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.\r\n\r\nFROM the conquerors of New Spain we fail to get any systematic\r\nportrayal of the character and history of the subjugated people;\r\nbut nevertheless we are not without some help in such studies from\r\nthe letters of Cortes,[857] the accounts of the so-called anonymous\r\nconqueror,[858] and from what Stephens[859] calls “the hurried and\r\nimperfect observations of an unlettered soldier,” Bernal Diaz.[860]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MS. OF BERNAL DIAZ.\r\n\r\nFac-simile of the beginning of Capitulo LXXIV. of his _Historia\r\nVerdadera_, following a plate in the fourth volume of J. M. de\r\nHeredia’s French translation (Paris, 1877).]\r\n\r\nWe cannot neglect for this ancient period the more general writers\r\non New Spain, some of whom lived near enough to the Conquest to\r\nreflect current opinions upon the aboriginal life as it existed in\r\nthe years next succeeding the fall of Mexico. Such are Peter Martyr,\r\nGrynæus, Münster, and Ramusio. More in the nature of chronicles is\r\nthe _Historia General_ of Oviedo (1535, etc.).[861] The _Historia\r\nGeneral_ of Gomara became generally known soon after the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century.[862] The _Rapport_, written about 1560, by Alonzo\r\nde Zurita, throws light on the Aztec laws and institutions.[863]\r\nBenzoni about this time traversed the country, observing the Indian\r\ncustoms.[864] We find other descriptions of the aboriginal customs by\r\nthe missionary Didacus Valades, in his _Rhetorica Christiana_, of which\r\nthe fourth part relates to Mexico.[865] Brasseur says that Valades\r\nwas well informed and appreciative of the people which he so kindly\r\ndepicted.[866] By the beginning of the seventeenth century we find in\r\nHerrera’s _Historia_ the most comprehensive of the historical surveys,\r\nin which he summarizes the earlier writers, if not always exactly.[867]\r\nBandelier (_Peabody Mus. Repts._, ii. 387) says of the ancient history\r\nof Mexico that “it appears as if the twelfth century was the limit\r\nof definite tradition. What lies beyond it is vague and uncertain,\r\nremnants of tradition being intermingled with legends and mythological\r\nfancies.” He cites some of the leading writers as mainly starting in\r\ntheir stories respectively as follows: Brasseur, B. C. 955; Clavigero,\r\nA.D. 596; Veytia, A.D. 697; Ixtlilxochitl, A.D. 503. Bandelier views\r\nall these dates as too mythical for historical investigations, and\r\nfinds no earlier fixed date than the founding of Tenochtitlan (Mexico)\r\nin A.D. 1325. “What lies beyond the twelfth century can occasionally\r\nbe rendered of value for ethnological purposes, but it admits of no\r\ndefinite historical use.” Bancroft (v. 360) speaks of the sources\r\nof disagreement in the final century of the native annals, from\r\nthe constant tendency of such writers as Ixtlilxochitl, Tezozomoc,\r\nChimalpain, and Camargo, to laud their own people and defame their\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the sixteenth century the viceroy of Mexico, Don\r\nMartin Enriquez, set on foot some measures to gather the relics and\r\ntraditions of the native Mexicans. Under this incentive it fell to\r\nJuan de Tobar, a Jesuit, and to Diego Duran, a Dominican, to be early\r\nassociated with the resuscitation of the ancient history of the country.\r\n\r\nTo Father Tobar (or Tovar) we owe what is known as the _Codex Ramirez_,\r\nwhich in the edition of the _Crónica Mexicana_[868] by Hernando de\r\nAlvarado Tezozomoc, issued in Mexico (1878), with annotations by Orozco\r\ny Berra, is called a _Relacion del origen de los Indios que habitan\r\nesta nueva España segun sus historias_ (José M. Vigil, editor). It\r\nis an important source of our knowledge of the ancient history of\r\nMexico, as authoritatively interpreted by the Aztec priests, from their\r\npicture-writings, at the bidding of Ramirez de Fuenleal, Bishop of\r\nCuenca. This ecclesiastic carried the document with him to Spain, where\r\nin Madrid it is still preserved. It was used by Herrera. Chavero and\r\nBrinton recognize its representative value.[869]\r\n\r\nTo Father Duran we are indebted for an equally ardent advocacy of the\r\nrights of the natives in his _Historia de las Indias de Nueva-España\r\ny islas de Tierra-Firme_ (1579-81), which was edited in part (1867),\r\nas stated elsewhere[870] by José F. Ramirez, and after an interval\r\ncompleted (1880) by Prof. Gumesindo Mendoza, of the Museo Nacional,—the\r\nperfected work making two volumes of text and an atlas of plates. Both\r\nfrom Tobar and from Duran some of the contemporary writers gathered\r\nlargely their material.[871]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAHAGUN.\r\n\r\nAfter a lithograph in Cumplido’s Mexican edition of Prescott’s\r\n_Mexico_.]\r\n\r\nWe come to a different kind of record when we deal with the Roman\r\nscript of the early phonetic rendering of the native tongues. It has\r\nbeen pointed out that we have perhaps the earliest of such renderings\r\nin a single sentence in a publication made at Antwerp in 1534, where\r\na Franciscan, Pedro de Gante,[872] under date of June 21, 1529, tells\r\nthe story of his arriving in America in 1523, and his spending the\r\ninterval in Mexico and Tezcuco, acquiring a knowledge of the natives\r\nand enough of their language to close his epistle with a sentence of it\r\nas a sample.[873] But no chance effort of this kind was enough. It took\r\nsystematic endeavors on the part of the priests to settle grammatical\r\nprinciples and determine phonetic values, and the measure of their\r\nsuccess was seen in the speedy way in which the interpretation of the\r\nold idiograms was forgotten. Mr. Brevoort has pointed out how much the\r\nprogress of what may be called native literature, which is to-day so\r\nhelpful to us in filling the picture of their ancient life, is due to\r\nthe labors in this process of linguistic transfer of Motolinfa,[874]\r\nAlonzo de Molina,[875] Andrés de Olmos,[876] and, above all, of the\r\nablest student of the ancient tongues in his day, as Mendieta calls\r\nFather Sahagún,[877] who, dying in 1590 at ninety, had spent a good\r\npart of a long life so that we of this generation might profit by his\r\nrecords.[878]\r\n\r\nComing later into the field than Duran, Acosta, and Sahagún, and\r\nprofiting from the labors of his predecessors, we find in the\r\n_Monarchia Indiana_ of Torquemada[879] the most comprehensive treatment\r\nof the ancient history given to us by any of the early Spanish writers.\r\nThe book, however, is a provoking one, from the want of plan, its\r\nchronological confusion, and the general lack of a critical spirit[880]\r\npervading it.\r\n\r\nIt is usually held that the earliest amassment of native records for\r\nhistorical purposes, after the Conquest, was that made by Ixtlilxochitl\r\nof the archives of his Tezcucan line, which he used in his writings in\r\na way that has not satisfied some later investigators. Charnay says\r\nthat in his own studies he follows Veytia by preference; but Prescott\r\nfinds beneath the high colors of the pictures of Ixtlilxochitl not a\r\nlittle to be commended. Bandelier,[881] on the other hand, expresses\r\na distrust when he says of Ixtlilxochitl that “he is always a very\r\nsuspicious authority, not because he is more confused than any other\r\nIndian writer, but because he wrote for an interested object, and\r\nwith a view of sustaining tribal claims in the eyes of the Spanish\r\ngovernment.”[882]\r\n\r\nAmong the manuscripts which seem to have belonged to Ixtlilxochitl\r\nwas the one known in our day under the designation given to it by\r\nBrasseur de Bourbourg, _Codex Chimalpopoca_,[883] in honor of Faustino\r\nChimalpopoca, a learned professor of Aztec, who assisted Brasseur in\r\ntranslating it. The anonymous author had set to himself the task of\r\nconverting into the written native tongue a rendering of the ancient\r\nhieroglyphics, constituting, as Brasseur says, a complete and regular\r\nhistory of Mexico and Colhuacan. He describes it in his _Lettres à M.\r\nle duc de Valmy_ (_lettre seconde_)—the first part (in Mexican) being a\r\nhistory of the Chichimecas; the second (in Spanish), by another hand,\r\nelucidating the antiquities—as the most rare and most precious of all\r\nthe manuscripts which escaped destruction, elucidating what was obscure\r\nin Gomara and Torquemada.\r\n\r\nBrasseur based upon this MS. his account of the Toltec period in\r\nhis _Nations Civilisées du Mexique_ (i. p. lxxviii), treating as an\r\nhistorical document what in later years, amid his vagaries, he assumed\r\nto be but the record of geological changes.[884] A similar use was\r\nmade by him of another MS., sometimes called a Memorial de Colhuacan,\r\nand which he named the _Codex Gondra_ after the director of the Museo\r\nNacional in Mexico.[885]\r\n\r\nBrasseur says, in the _Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne_, that the\r\n_Chimalpopoca MS._ is dated in 1558, but in his _Hist. Nat. Civ._, i.\r\np. lxxix, he says that it was written in 1563 and 1579, by a writer\r\nof Quauhtitlan, and not by Ixtlilxochitl, as was thought by Pichardo,\r\nwho with Gama possessed copies later owned by Aubin. The copy used\r\nby Brasseur was, as he says, made from the MS. in the Boturini\r\ncollection,[886] where it was called _Historia de los Reynos de\r\nColhuacan y México_,[887] and it is supposed to be the original, now\r\npreserved in the Museo Nacional de México. It is not all legible, and\r\nthat institution has published only the better preserved and earlier\r\nparts of it, though Aubin’s copies are said to contain the full text.\r\nThis edition, which is called _Anales de Cuauhtitlan_, is accompanied\r\nby two Spanish versions, the early one made for Brasseur, and a new one\r\nexecuted by Mendoza and Solis, and it is begun in the _Anales del Museo\r\nNacional_ for 1879 (vol. i.).[888]\r\n\r\nThe next after Ixtlilxochitl to become conspicuous as a collector,\r\nwas Sigüenza y Gongora (b. 1645), and it was while he was the chief\r\nkeeper of such records[889] that the Italian traveller Giovanni\r\nFrancesco Gemelli Carreri examined them, and made some record of\r\nthem.[890] A more important student inspected the collection, which\r\nwas later gathered in the College of San Pedro and San Pablo, and\r\nthis was Clavigero,[891] who manifested a particular interest in the\r\npicture-writing of the Mexicans,[892] and has given us a useful account\r\nof the antecedent historians.[893]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLAVIGERO.\r\n\r\nAfter a lithograph in Cumplido’s Mexican edition of Prescott’s\r\n_Mexico_, vol. iii.]\r\n\r\nThe best known efforts at collecting material for the ante-Spanish\r\nhistory of Mexico were made by Boturini,[894] who had come over to\r\nNew Spain in 1736, on some agency for a descendant of Montezuma, the\r\nCountess de Santibañez. Here he became interested in the antiquities\r\nof the country, and spent eight years roving about the country\r\npicking up manuscripts and pictures, and seeking in vain for some one\r\nto explain their hieroglyphics. Some action on his part incurring\r\nthe displeasure of the public authorities, he was arrested, his\r\ncollection[895] taken from him, and he was sent to Spain. On the\r\nvoyage an English cruiser captured the vessel in which he was, and\r\nhe thus lost whatever he chanced to have with him.[896] What he left\r\nbehind remained in the possession of the government, and became the\r\nspoil of damp, revolutionists, and curiosity-seekers. Once again in\r\nSpain, Boturini sought redress of the Council of the Indies, and was\r\nsustained by it in his petition; but neither he nor his heirs succeeded\r\nin recovering his collection. He also prepared a book setting forth\r\nhow he proposed, by the aid of these old manuscripts and pictures,\r\nto resuscitate the forgotten history of the Mexicans. The book[897]\r\nis a jumble of notions; but appended to it was what gives it its\r\nchief value, a “Catálogo del Museo histórico Indiano,” which tells us\r\nwhat the collection was. While it was thus denied to its collector,\r\nMariano Veytia,[898] who had sympathized with Boturini in Madrid, had\r\npossession, for a while at least, of a part of it, and made use of\r\nit in his _Historia Antigua de Méjico_, but it is denied, as usually\r\nstated, that the authorities upon his death (1778) prevented the\r\npublication of his book. The student was deprived of Veytia’s results\r\ntill his MS. was ably edited, with notes and an appendix, by C. F.\r\nOrtega (Mexico, 1836).[899] Another, who was connected at a later\r\nday with the Boturini collection, and who was a more accurate writer\r\nthan Veytia, was Antonio de Leon y Gama, born in Mexico in 1735. His\r\n_Descripcion histórica y Cronológica de las Dos Piedras_ (Mexico,\r\n1832)[900] was occasioned by the finding, in 1790, of the great\r\nMexican Calendar Stone and other sculptures in the Square of Mexico.\r\nThis work brought to bear Gama’s great learning to the interpretation\r\nof these relics, and to an exposition of the astronomy and mythology\r\nof the ancient Mexicans, in a way that secured the commendation of\r\nHumboldt.[901]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORENZO BOTURINI.\r\n\r\nAfter a lithograph in Cumplido’s Mexican edition of Prescott’s\r\n_Mexico_. There is an etched portrait in the _Archives de la Soc.\r\nAméricaine de France, nouvelle série_, i., which is accompanied by an\r\nessay on this “Père de l’Américanisme,” and “les sources aux quelles il\r\na puisé son précis d’histoire Américaine,” by Léon Cahun.]\r\n\r\nDuring these years of uncertainty respecting the Boturini collection,\r\na certain hold upon it seems to have been shared successively by\r\nPichardo and Sanchez, by which in the end some part came to the Museo\r\nNacional, in Mexico.[902] It was also the subject of lawsuits, which\r\nfinally resulted in the dispersion of what was left by public auction,\r\nat a time when Humboldt was passing through Mexico, and some of its\r\ntreasures were secured by him and placed in the Berlin Museum. Others\r\npassed hither and thither (a few to Kingsborough), but not in a way\r\nto obscure their paths, so that when, in 1830, Aubin was sent to\r\nMexico by the French government, he was able to secure a considerable\r\nportion of them, as the result of searches during the next ten years.\r\nIt was with the purpose, some years later, of assisting in the\r\nelucidation and publication of Aubin’s collection that the Société\r\nAméricaine de France was established. The collection of historical\r\nrecords, as Aubin held it, was described, in 1881, by himself,[903]\r\nwhen he divided his Mexican picture-writings into two classes,—those\r\nwhich had belonged to Boturini, and those which had not.[904] Aubin\r\nat the same time described his collection of the Spanish MSS. of\r\nIxtlilxochitl,[905] while he congratulated himself that he had secured\r\nthe old picture-writings upon which that native writer depended in the\r\nearly part of his _Historia Chichimeca_. These Spanish MSS. bear the\r\nsignature and annotations of Veytia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRONTISPIECE OF BOTURINI’S IDEA.]\r\n\r\nWe have another description of the Aubin collection by Brasseur de\r\nBourbourg.[906]\r\n\r\nIf we allow the first place among native writers, using the Spanish\r\ntongue, to Ixtlilxochitl, we find several others of considerable\r\nservice: Diego Muñoz Camargo, a Tlaxcallan Mestizo, wrote (1585) a\r\n_Historia de Tlaxcallan_.[907] Tezozomoc’s _Crónica Mexicana_ is\r\nprobably best known through Ternaux’s version,[908] and there is an\r\nItalian abridgment in F. C. Marmocchi’s _Raccolta di Viaggi_ (vol.\r\nx.). The catalogue of Boturini discloses a MS. by a Cacique of\r\nQuiahuiztlan, Juan Ventura Zapata y Mendoza, which brings the _Crónica\r\nde la muy noble y real Ciudad de Tlaxcallan_ from the earliest times\r\ndown to 1689; but it is not now known. Torquemada and others cite\r\ntwo native Tezcucan writers,—Juan Bautista Pomar, whose _Relacion de\r\nlas Antigüedades de los Indios_[909] treats of the manners of his\r\nancestors, and Antonio Pimentel, whose _Relaciones_ are well known. The\r\nMS. _Crónica Mexicana_ of Anton Muñon Chimalpain (b. 1579), tracing\r\nthe annals from the eleventh century, is or was among the Aubin\r\nMSS.[910] There was collected before 1536, under the orders of Bishop\r\nZumárraga, a number of aboriginal tales and traditions, which under the\r\ntitle of _Historia de los Mexicanos por sus Pinturas_ was printed by\r\nIcazbalceta, who owns the MS., in the _Anales del Museo Nacional_ (ii.\r\nno. 2).[911]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICAZBALCETA.\r\n\r\n[After a photograph kindly furnished by himself at the editor’s\r\nrequest.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nAs regards Yucatan, Brasseur[912] speaks of the scantiness of the\r\nhistorical material, and Brinton[913] does not know a single case where\r\na Maya author has written in the Spanish tongue, as the Aztecs did,\r\nunder Spanish influence. We owe more to Dr. Daniel Garrison Brinton\r\nthan to any one else for the elucidation of the native records, and he\r\nhad had the advantage of the collection of Yucatan MSS. formed by Dr.\r\nC. H. Berendt,[914] which, after that gentleman’s death, passed into\r\nBrinton’s hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFESSOR DANIEL G. BRINTON.]\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the ancient records by Landa, considerable\r\nefforts were made throughout Yucatan, in a sort of reactionary spirit,\r\nto recall the lingering recollections of what these manuscripts\r\ncontained. The grouping of such recovered material became known as\r\nChilan Balam.[915] It is from local collections of this kind that\r\nBrinton selected the narratives which he has published as _The Maya\r\nChronicles_, being the first volume of his _Library of Aboriginal\r\nAmerican Literature_. The original texts[916] are accompanied by an\r\nEnglish translation. One of the books, the Chilan Balam of Mani,\r\nhad been earlier printed by Stephens, in his _Yucatan_.[917] The\r\nonly early Spanish chronicle is Bishop Landa’s _Relation des choses\r\nde Yucatan_,[918] which follows not an original, but a copy of the\r\nbishop’s text, written, as Brasseur thinks, thirty years after Landa’s\r\ndeath, or about 1610, and which Brasseur first brought to the world’s\r\nattention when he published his edition, with both Spanish and French\r\ntexts, at Paris, in 1864. The MS. seems to have been incomplete, and\r\nwas perhaps inaccurately copied at the time. At this date (1864)\r\nBrasseur had become an enthusiast for his theory of the personification\r\nof the forces of nature in the old recitals, and there was some\r\ndistrust how far his zeal had affected his text; and moreover he\r\nhad not published the entire text, but had omitted about one sixth.\r\nBrasseur’s method of editing became apparent when, in 1884, at Madrid,\r\nJuan de Dios de la Rada y Delgado published literally the whole Spanish\r\ntext, as an appendix to the Spanish translation of Rosny’s essay on the\r\nhieratic writing. The Spanish editor pointed out some but not all the\r\ndifferences between his text and Brasseur’s,—a scrutiny which Brinton\r\nhas perfected in his _Critical Remarks on the Editions of Landa’s\r\nWritings_ (Philad., 1887).[919] Landa gives extracts from a work by\r\nBernardo Lizana, relating to Yucatan, of which it is difficult to get\r\nother information.[920] The earliest published historical narrative was\r\nCogolludo’s _Historia de Yucathan_ (Madrid, 1688).[921] Stephens, in\r\nhis study of the subject, speaks of it as “voluminous, confused, and\r\nill-digested,” and says “it might almost be called a history of the\r\nFranciscan friars, to which order Cogolludo belonged.”[922]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe native sources of the aboriginal history of Guatemala, and\r\nof what is sometimes called the Quiché-Cakchiquel Empire, are\r\nnot abundant,[923] but the most important are the _Popul Vuh_, a\r\ntraditional book of the Quichés, and the _Memorial de Tecpan-Atitlan_.\r\n\r\nThe _Popul Vuh_ was discovered in the library of the university at\r\nGuatemala, probably not far from 1700,[924] by Francisco Ximenez, a\r\nmissionary in a mountain village of the country. Ximenez did not find\r\nthe original Quiché book, but a copy of it, made after it was lost,\r\nand later than the Conquest, which we may infer was reproduced from\r\nmemory to replace the lost text, and in this way it may have received\r\nsome admixture of Christian thought.[925] It was this sort of a text\r\nthat Ximenez turned into Spanish; and this version, with the copy of\r\nthe Quiché, which Ximenez also made, is what has come down to us.\r\nKarl Scherzer, a German traveller[926] in the country, found Ximenez’\r\nwork, which had seemingly passed into the university library on the\r\nsuppression of the monasteries, and which, as he supposes, had not been\r\nprinted because of some disagreeable things in it about the Spanish\r\ntreatment of the natives. Scherzer edited the MS., which was published\r\nas _Las Historias del Origen de los Indios de Esta Provincia de\r\nGuatemala_[927] (Vienna, 1857).\r\n\r\nBrasseur, who had seen the Ximenez MSS. in 1855, considered the Spanish\r\nversion untrustworthy, and so with the aid of some natives he gave it\r\na French rendering, and republished it a few years later as _Popol\r\nVuh_. _Le Livre sacré et les Mythes de l’antiquité américaine, avec\r\nles livres héroïques et historiques des Quichés. Ouvrage original\r\ndes indigènes de Guatémala, texte Quiché et trad. française en\r\nregard, accompagnée de notes philologiques et d’un commentaire sur la\r\nmythologie et les migrations des peuples anciens de l’Amérique, etc.,\r\ncomposé sur des documents originaux et inédits_ (Paris, 1861).\r\n\r\nBrasseur’s introduction bears the special title: _Dissertation sur les\r\nmythes de l’antiquité Américaine sur la probabilité des Communications\r\nexistant anciennement d’un Continent à l’autre, et sur les migrations\r\ndes peuples indigènes de l’Amérique_,—in which he took occasion to\r\nelucidate his theory of cataclysms and Atlantis. He speaks of his\r\nannotations as the results of his observations among the Quichés and\r\nof his prolonged studies. He calls the _Popul Vuh_ rather a national\r\nthan a sacred book,[928] and thinks it the original in some part of\r\nthe “Livre divin des Toltèques,” the Teo-Amoxtli.[929] Brinton avers\r\nthat neither Ximenez nor Brasseur has adequately translated the Quiché\r\ntext,[930] and sees no reason to think that the matter has been in any\r\nway influenced by the Spanish contact, emanating indeed long before\r\nthat event; and he has based some studies upon it.[931] In this opinion\r\nBandelier is at variance, at least as regards the first portion, for\r\nhe believes it to have been _written_ after the Conquest and under\r\nChristian influences.[932] Brasseur in some of his other writings has\r\nfurther discussed the matter.[933]\r\n\r\nThe _Memorial of Tecpan-Atitlan_, to use Brasseur’s title, is an\r\nincomplete MS.,[934] found in 1844 by Juan Gavarrete in rearranging\r\nthe MSS. of the convent of San Francisco, of Guatemala, and it was\r\nby Gavarrete that a Spanish version of Brasseur’s rendering was\r\nprinted in 1873 in the _Boletin de la Sociedad económica de Guatemala_\r\n(nos. 29-43). This translation by Brasseur, made in 1856, was never\r\nprinted by him, but, passing into Pinart’s hands with Brasseur’s\r\ncollections,[935] it was entrusted by that collector to Dr. Brinton,\r\nwho selected the parts of interest (46 out of 96 pp.), and included it\r\nas vol. vi. in his _Library of Aboriginal American Literature_, under\r\nthe title of _The annals of the Cakchiquels_. _The original text, with\r\na translation, notes, and introduction_ (Philadelphia, 1885).\r\n\r\nBrinton disagrees with Brasseur in placing the date of its beginning\r\ntowards the opening of the eleventh century, and puts it rather at\r\nabout A.D. 1380. Brasseur says he received the original from Gavarrete,\r\nand it would seem to have been a copy made between 1620 and 1650,\r\nthough it bears internal evidence of having been written by one who was\r\nof adult age at the time of the Conquest.\r\n\r\nBrinton’s introduction discusses the ethnological position of the\r\nCakchiquels, who he thinks had been separated from the Mayas for a long\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe next in importance of the Guatemalan books is the work of\r\nFrancisco Antonio de Fuentes y Guzman, _Historia de Guatemala, ó\r\nRecordación florida escrita el siglo xvii., que publica por primera vez\r\ncon notas é ilustraciones F. Zaragoza_ (Madrid, 1882-83), being vols. 1\r\nand 2 of the _Biblioteca de los americanistas_. The original MS., dated\r\n1690, is in the archives of the city of Guatemala. Owing to a tendency\r\nof the author to laud the natives, modern historians have looked with\r\nsome suspicion on his authority, and have pointed out inconsistencies\r\nand suspected errors.[936] Of a later writer, Ramon de Ordoñez\r\n(died about 1840), we have only the rough draught of a _Historia\r\nde la creation del Cielo y de la tierra, conforme al sistema de la\r\ngentilidad Americana_, which is of importance for traditions.[937] This\r\nmanuscript, preserved in the Museo Nacional in Mexico, is all that now\r\nexists, representing the perfected work. Brasseur (_Bib. Mex.-Guat._,\r\n113) had a copy of this draught (made in 1848-49). The original fair\r\ncopy was sent to Madrid for the press, and it is suspected that the\r\nCouncil for the Indies suppressed it in 1805. Ramon cites a manuscript\r\n_Hist. de la Prov. de San Vicente de Chiappas y Goathemala_, which is\r\nperhaps the same as the _Crónica de la Prov. de Chiapas y Guatemala_,\r\nof which the seventh book is in the Museo Nacional (_Am. Antiq. Soc.\r\nProc._, n. s., i. 97; Brasseur, _Bib. Mex.-Guat._, 157).\r\n\r\nThe work of Antonio de Remesal is sometimes cited as _Historia general\r\nde las Indias occidentales, y particular de la gobernacion de Chiapas y\r\nGuatemala_, and sometimes as _Historia de la Provincia de San Vicente\r\nde Chyapa y Guatemala_ (Madrid, 1619, 1620).[938]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBandelier (_Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, i. 95) has indicated the\r\nleading sources of the history of Chiapas, so closely associated\r\nwith Guatemala. To round the study of the aboriginal period of this\r\nPacific region, we may find something in Alvarado’s letters on the\r\nConquest;[939] in Las Casas for the interior parts, and in Alonso de\r\nZurita’s _Relacion_, 1560,[940] as respects the Quiché tribes, which\r\nis the source of much in Herrera.[941] For Oajaca (Oaxaca, Guaxaca)\r\nthe special source is Francisco de Burgoa’s _Geográfica descripcion de\r\nla parte septentrional del Polo Artico de la América_, etc. (México,\r\n1674), in two quarto volumes,—or at least it is generally so regarded.\r\nBandelier, who traces the works on Oajaca (_Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._,\r\nn. s., i. 115), says there is a book of a modern writer, Juan B.\r\nCarriedo, which follows Burgoa largely. Brasseur (_Bib. Mex.-Guat._,\r\np. 33) speaks of Burgoa as the only source which remains of the native\r\nhistory of Oajaca. He says it is a very rare book, even in Mexico. He\r\nlargely depends upon its full details in some parts of his _Nations\r\nCivilisées_ (iii. livre 9). Alonso de la Rea’s _Crónica de Mechoacan_\r\n(Mexico, 1648) and Basalenque’s _Crónica de San Augustin de Mechoacan_\r\n(Mexico, 1673) are books which Brinton complains he could find in no\r\nlibrary in the United States.\r\n\r\nWe trace the aboriginal condition of Nicaragua in Peter Martyr, Oviedo,\r\nTorquemada, and Ixtlilxochitl.[942]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe earliest general account of all these ancient peoples which we\r\nhave in English is in the _History of America_, by William Robertson,\r\nwho describes the condition of Mexico at the time of the Conquest,\r\nand epitomizes the early Spanish accounts of the natives. Prescott\r\nand Helps followed in his steps, with new facilities. Albert Gallatin\r\nbrought the powers of a vigorous intellect to bear, though but\r\ncursorily, upon the subject, in his “Notes on the semi-civilized\r\nnations of Mexico, Yucatan, and Central America,” in the _Amer.\r\nEthnological Society’s Transactions_ (N. Y., 1845, vol. i.), and\r\nhe was about the first to recognize the dangerous pitfalls of the\r\npseudo-historical narratives of these peoples. The _Native Races_[943]\r\nof H. H. Bancroft was the first very general sifting and massing in\r\nEnglish of the great confusion of material upon their condition,\r\nmyths, languages, antiquities, and history.[944] The archæological\r\nremains are treated by Stephens for Yucatan and Central America, by\r\nDr. Le Plongeon[945] for Yucatan, by Ephraim G. Squier for Nicaragua\r\nand Central America in general,[946] by Adolphe F. A. Bandelier in his\r\ncommunications to the Peabody Museum and to the Archæological Institute\r\nof America,[947] and by Professor Daniel G. Brinton in his editing of\r\nancient records[948] and in his mythological and linguistic studies,\r\nreferred to elsewhere. To these may be added, as completing the English\r\nreferences, various records of personal observations.[949]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRASSEUR DE BOURBOURG.\r\n\r\nFollows an etching published in the _Annuaire de la Société Américaine\r\nde France_, 1875. He died at Nice, Jan. 8, 1874, aged 59 years.]\r\n\r\nDuring the American Civil War, when there were hopes of some\r\npermanence for French influence in Mexico, the French government\r\nmade some organized efforts to further the study of the antiquities\r\nof the country, and the results were published in the _Archives\r\nde la Commission Scientifique du Méxique_ (Paris, 1864-69, in 3\r\nvols.).[950] The Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, who took a conspicuous\r\npart in this labor, has probably done more than any other Frenchman\r\nto bring into order the studies upon these ancient races, and in some\r\ndirections he is our ultimate source. Unfortunately his character as\r\nan archæological expounder did not improve as he went on, and he grew\r\nto be the expositor of some wild notions that have proved acceptable\r\nto few. He tells us that he first had his attention turned to American\r\narchæology by the report, which had a short run in European circles,\r\nof the discovery of a Macedonian helmet and weapons in Brazil in\r\n1832, and by a review of Rio’s report on Palenqué, which he read in\r\nthe _Journal des Savants_. Upon coming to America, fresh from his\r\nstudies in Rome, he was made professor of history in the seminary at\r\nQuebec in 1845-46, writing at that time a _Histoire du Canada_, of\r\nlittle value. Later, in Boston, he perfected his English and read\r\nPrescott. Then we find him at Rome poring over the _Codex Vaticanus_,\r\nand studying the _Codex Borgianus_ in the library of the Propaganda.\r\nIn 1848 he returned to the United States, and, embarking at New\r\nOrleans for Mexico, he found himself on shipboard in the company of\r\nthe new French minister, whom he accompanied, on landing, to the city\r\nof Mexico, being made almoner to the legation. This official station\r\ngave him some advantage in beginning his researches, in which Rafael\r\nIsidro Gondra, the director of the Museo, with the curators of the\r\nvice-regal archives, and José Maria Andrade, the librarian of the\r\nuniversity, assisted him. Later he gave himself to the study of the\r\nNahua tongue, under the guidance of Faustino Chimalpopoca Galicia, a\r\ndescendant of a brother of Montezuma, then a professor in the college\r\nof San Gregorio. In 1851 he was ready to print at Mexico, in French and\r\nSpanish, his _Lettres pour servir d’introduction à l’histoire primitive\r\ndes anciennes nations civilisées du Méxique_, addressed (October, 1850)\r\nto the Duc de Valmy, in which he sketched the progress of his studies\r\nup to that time. He speaks of it as “le premier fruit de mes travaux\r\nd’archéologie et d’histoire méxicaines.”[951] It was this brochure\r\nwhich introduced him to the attention of Squier and Aubin, and from\r\nthe latter, during his residence in Paris (1851-54), he received great\r\nassistance. Pressed in his circumstances, he was obliged at this time\r\nto eke out his living by popular writing, which helped also to enable\r\nhim to publish his successive works.[952] To complete his Central\r\nAmerican studies, he went again to America in 1854, and in Washington\r\nhe saw for the first time the texts of Las Casas and Duran, in the\r\ncollection of Peter Force, who had got copies from Madrid. He has\r\ngiven us[953] an account of his successful search for old manuscripts\r\nin Central America. Finally, as the result of all these studies, he\r\npublished his most important work,—_Histoire des nations civilisées\r\ndu Méxique et de l’Amérique centrale durant les siècles antérieurs\r\nà C. Colomb, écrite sur des docs. origin. et entièrement inédits,\r\npuisés aux anciennes archives des indigènes_ (Paris, 1857-58).[954]\r\nThis was the first orderly and extensive effort to combine out of all\r\navailable material, native and Spanish, a divisionary and consecutive\r\nhistory of ante-Columbian times in these regions, to which he added\r\nfrom the native sources a new account of the conquest by the Spaniards.\r\nHis purpose to separate the historic from the mythical may incite\r\ncriticism, but his views are the result of more labor and more\r\nknowledge than any one before him had brought to the subject.[955]\r\nIn his later publications there is less reason to be satisfied with\r\nhis results, and Brinton[956] even thinks that “he had a weakness to\r\nthrow designedly considerable obscurity about his authorities and the\r\nsources of his knowledge.” His fellow-students almost invariably yield\r\npraise to his successful research and to his great learning, surpassing\r\nperhaps that of any of them, but they are one and all chary of adopting\r\nhis later theories.[957] These were expressed at length in his _Quatre\r\nlettres sur le Mexique_. _Exposition du système hiéroglyphique\r\nmexicain. La fin de l’âge de pierre. Époque glaciaire temporaire.\r\nCommencement de l’âge de bronze. Origines de la civilisation et des\r\nreligions de l’antiquité. D’après le Teo-Amoxtli_ [etc.] (Paris,\r\n1868), wherein he accounted as mere symbolism what he had earlier\r\nelucidated as historical records, and connected the recital of the\r\n_Codex Chimalpopoca_ with the story of Atlantis, making that lost\r\nland the original seat of all old-world and new-world civilization,\r\nand finding in that sacred history of Colhuacan and Mexico the secret\r\nevidence of a mighty cataclysm that sunk the continent from Honduras\r\n(subsequently with Yucatan elevated) to perhaps the Canaries.[958] Two\r\nyears later, in his elucidation of the _MS. Troano_ (1869-70), this\r\nsame theory governed all his study. Brasseur was quite aware of the\r\nloss of estimation which followed upon his erratic change of opinion,\r\nas the introduction to his _Bibl. Mex.-Guatémalienne_ shows. No other\r\nFrench writer, however, has so associated his name with the history of\r\nthese early peoples.[959]\r\n\r\nIn Mexico itself the earliest general narrative was not cast in the\r\nusual historical form, but in the guise of a dialogue, held night\r\nafter night, between a Spaniard and an Indian, the ancient history\r\nof the country was recounted. The author, Joseph Joaquin Granados y\r\nGalvez, published it in 1778, as _Tardes Américanas: gobierno gentil\r\ny católico: breve y particular noticia de toda la historia Indiana:\r\nsucesos, casos notables, y cosas ignoradas, desde la entrada de la\r\nGran nacion Tulteca á esta tierra de Anahuac, hasta los presentes\r\ntiempos_.[960]\r\n\r\nThe most comprehensive grouping of historical material is in\r\nthe _Diccionario Universal de historia y de Geografía_ (Mexico,\r\n1853-56),[961] of which Manuel Orozco y Berra was one of the chief\r\ncollaborators. This last author has in two other works added very much\r\nto our knowledge of the racial and ancient history of the indigenous\r\npeoples. These are his _Geografía de las lenguas y Carta Etnográfica\r\nde México_ (Mexico, 1864),[962] and his _Historia antigua y de la\r\nConquista de México_ (Mexico, 1880, in four volumes).[963] Perhaps the\r\nmost important of all the Mexican publications is Manuel Larrainzar’s\r\n_Estudios sobre la historia de América, sus ruinas y antigüedades,\r\ncomparadas con lo más notable del otro Continente_ (Mexico, 1875-1878,\r\nin five volumes).\r\n\r\nIn German the most important of recent books is Hermann Strebel’s\r\n_Alt-Mexico_ (Hamburg, 1885); but Waitz’s _Amerikaner_ (1864, vol. ii.)\r\nhas a section on the Mexicans. Adolph Bastian’s “Zur Geschichte des\r\nAlten Mexico” is contained in the second volume of his _Culturländer\r\ndes Alten America_ (Berlin, 1878), in which he considers the subject of\r\nQuetzalcoatl, the religious ceremonial, administrative and social life,\r\nas well as the different stocks of the native tribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE AUTHORITIES ON THE SO-CALLED CIVILIZATION OF ANCIENT MEXICO AND\r\nADJACENT LANDS, AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SUCH AUTHORITIES.\r\n\r\nTHE ancient so-called civilization which the Spaniards found in Mexico\r\nand Central America is the subject of much controversy: in the first\r\nplace as regards its origin, whether indigenous, or allied to and\r\nderived from the civilizations of the Old World; and in the second\r\nplace as regards its character, whether it was something more than\r\na kind of grotesque barbarism, or of a nature that makes even the\r\nSpanish culture, which supplanted it, inferior in some respects by\r\ncomparison.[964] The first of these problems, as regards its origin, is\r\nconsidered in another place. As respects the second, or its character,\r\nit is proposed here to follow the history of opinions.\r\n\r\nIn a book published at Seville in 1519, Martin Fernandez d’Enciso’s\r\n_Suma de geographia que trata de todas las partidas y provincias\r\ndel mundo: en especial de las Indias_,[965] the European reader\r\nis supposed to have received the earliest hints of the degree of\r\ncivilization—if it be so termed—of which the succeeding Spanish writers\r\nmade so much. A brief sentence was thus the shadowy beginning of the\r\nstories of grandeur and magnificence[966] which we find later in\r\nCortes, Bernal Diaz, Las Casas, Torquemada, Sahagún, Ramusio, Gomara,\r\nOviedo, Zurita, Tezozomoc, and Ixtlilxochitl, and which is repeated\r\noften with accumulating effect in Acosta, Herrera, Lorenzana, Solis,\r\nClavigero, and their successors.[967] Bandelier[968] points out how\r\nRobertson, in his views of Mexican civilization as in “the infancy of\r\ncivil life,”[969] really opened the view for the first time of the\r\nexaggerated and uncritical estimates of the older writers, which Morgan\r\nhas carried in our day to the highest pitch, and, as it would seem,\r\nwithout sufficient recognition of some of the contrary evidence.\r\n\r\nIt has usually been held that the creation among the Mexicans\r\nabout thirty years after the founding of Mexico of a chief-of-men\r\n(Tlacatecuhtli) instituted a feudal monarchy. Bandelier,[970] speaking\r\nof the application of feudal terms by the old writers to Mexican\r\ninstitutions, says: “What in their first process of thinking was\r\nmerely a comparative, became very soon a positive terminology for the\r\npurpose of describing institutions to which this foreign terminology\r\nnever was adapted.” He instances that the so-called “king” of these\r\nearly writers was a translation of the native term, which in fact\r\nonly meant “one of those who spoke;” that is, a prominent member of\r\nthe council.[971] Bandelier traces the beginning of the feudal ideas\r\nas a graft upon the native systems, in the oldest document issued by\r\nEuropeans on Mexican soil, when Cortes (May 20, 1519) conferred land\r\non his allies, the chiefs of Axapusco and Tepeyahualco, and for the\r\nfirst time made their offices hereditary. It is Bandelier’s opinion\r\nthat “the grantees had no conception of the true import of what they\r\naccepted; neither did Cortes conceive the nature of their ideas.” This\r\nwas followed after the Spanish occupation of Mexico by the institution\r\nof “repartimientos,” through which the natives became serfs of the soil\r\nto the conquerors.[972]\r\n\r\nThe story about this unknown splendor of a strange civilization\r\nfascinated the world nearly half a century ago in the kindly recital\r\nof Prescott;[973] but it was observed that he quoted too often the\r\nsomewhat illusory and exaggerated statements of Ixtlilxochitl, and\r\nwas not a little attracted by the gorgeous pictures of Waldeck and\r\nDupaix. With such a charming depicter, the barbaric gorgeousness of\r\nthis ancient empire, as it became the fashion to call it, gathered\r\na new interest, which has never waned, and Morgan[974] is probably\r\ncorrect in affirming that it “has called into existence a larger number\r\nof works than were ever before written upon any people of the same\r\nnumber and of the same importance.”[975] Even those who, like Tylor,\r\nhad gone to Mexico sceptics, had been forced to the conclusion that\r\nPrescott’s pictures were substantially correct, and setting aside what\r\nhe felt to be the monstrous exaggerations of Solis, Gomara, and the\r\nrest, he could not find the history much less trustworthy than European\r\nhistory of the same period.[976] It has been told in another place[977]\r\nhow the derogatory view, as opposed to the views of Prescott, were\r\nexpressed by R. A. Wilson in his _New Conquest of Mexico_, in assuming\r\nthat all the conquerors said was baseless fabrication, the European\r\nMontezuma becoming a petty Indian chief, and the great city of Mexico\r\na collection of hovels in an everglade,—the ruins of the country being\r\naccounted for by supposing them the relics of an ancient Phœnician\r\ncivilization, which had been stamped out by the inroads of barbarians,\r\nwhose equally barbarious descendants the Spaniards were in turn to\r\novercome. It cannot be said that such iconoclastic opinions obtained\r\nany marked acceptance; but it was apparent that the notion of the\r\nexaggeration of the Spanish accounts was becoming sensibly fixed in the\r\nworld’s opinion. We see this reaction in a far less excessive way in\r\nDaniel Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_ (i. 325, etc.), and he was struck,\r\namong other things, with the utter obliteration of the architectural\r\ntraces of the conquered race in the city of Mexico itself.[978] When,\r\nin 1875, Hubert H. Bancroft published the second volume of his _Native\r\nRaces_, he confessed “that much concerning the Aztec civilization had\r\nbeen greatly exaggerated by the old Spanish writers, and for obvious\r\nreasons;” but he contended that the stories of their magnificence\r\nmust in the main be accepted, because of the unanimity of witnesses,\r\nnotwithstanding their copying from one another, and because of the\r\nevidence of the ruins.[979] He strikes his key-note in his chapter\r\non the “Government of the Nahua Nations,” in speaking of it as\r\n“monarchical and nearly absolute;”[980] but it was perhaps in his\r\nchapter on the “Palaces and Households of the Nahua Kings,” where he\r\nfortifies his statement by numerous references, that he carried his\r\ndescriptions to the extent that allied his opinions to those who most\r\nunhesitatingly accepted the old stories.[981]\r\n\r\nThe most serious arraignment of these long-accepted views was by Lewis\r\nH. Morgan, who speaks of them as having “caught the imagination and\r\novercome the critical judgment of Prescott, ravaged the sprightly brain\r\nof Brasseur de Bourbourg, and carried up in a whirlwind our author at\r\nthe Golden Gate.”[982]\r\n\r\nMorgan’s studies had been primarily among the Iroquois, and by\r\nanalogy he had applied his reasoning to the aboriginal conditions\r\nof Mexico and Central America, thus degrading their so-called\r\ncivilization to the level of the Indian tribal organization, as it was\r\nunderstood in the North.[983] Morgan’s confidence in its deductions\r\nwas perfect, and he was not very gracious in alluding to the views\r\nof his opponents. He looked upon “the fabric of Aztec romance as the\r\nmost deadly encumbrance upon American ethnology.”[984] The Spanish\r\nchroniclers, as he contended, “inaugurated American aboriginal history\r\nupon a misconception of Indian life, which has remained substantially\r\nunquestioned till recently.”[985] He charges upon ignorance of the\r\nstructure and principles of Indian society, the perversion of all\r\nthe writers,[986] from Cortes to Bancroft, who, as he says, unable\r\nto comprehend its peculiarities, invoked the imagination to supply\r\nwhatever was necessary to fill out the picture.[987] The actual\r\ncondition to which the Indians of Spanish America had reached was,\r\naccording to his schedule, the upper status of barbarism, between\r\nwhich and the beginning of civilization he reckoned an entire ethnical\r\nperiod. “In the art of government they had not been able to rise above\r\ngentile institutions and establish political society. This fact,”\r\nMorgan continues, “demonstrates the impossibility of privileged classes\r\nand of potentates, under their institutions, with power to enforce the\r\nlabor of the people for the erection of palaces for their use, and\r\nexplains the absence of such structures.”[988]\r\n\r\nThis is the essence of the variance of the two schools of\r\ninterpretation of the Aztec and Maya life. The reader of Bancroft will\r\nfind, on the other hand, due recognition of an imperial system, with\r\nits monarch and nobles and classes of slaves, and innumerable palaces,\r\nof which we see to-day the ruins. The studies of Bandelier are appealed\r\nto by Morgan as substantiating his view.[989] Mrs. Zelia Nuttall\r\n(_Proc. Am. Assoc. Adv. Sci._, Aug., 1886) claims to be able to show\r\nthat the true interpretation of the Borgian and other codices points in\r\npart at least to details of a communal life.\r\n\r\nThe special issues which for a test Morgan takes with Bancroft are in\r\nregard to the character of the house in which Montezuma lived, and\r\nof the dinner which is represented by Bernal Diaz and the rest as\r\nthe daily banquet of an imperial potentate. Morgan’s criticism is in\r\nhis _Houses and House Life of the American Aborigines_ (Washington,\r\n1881).[990] The basis of this book had been intended for a fifth Part\r\nof his _Ancient Society_, but was not used in that publication. He\r\nprinted the material, however, in papers on “Montezuma’s Dinner” (_No.\r\nAm. Rev._, Ap. 1876), “Houses of the Moundbuilders” (_Ibid._, July,\r\n1876), and “Study of the Houses and House Life of the Indian Tribes”\r\n(_Archæol. Inst. of Amer. Publ._). These papers amalgamated now make\r\nthe work called _Houses and House Life_.[991]\r\n\r\nMorgan argues that a communal mode of living accords with the usages\r\nof aboriginal hospitality, as well as with their tenure of lands,[992]\r\nand with the large buildings, which others call palaces, and he calls\r\njoint tenement houses. He instances, as evidence of the size of such\r\nhouses, that at Cholula four hundred Spaniards and one thousand allied\r\nIndians found lodging in such a house; and he points to Stephens’s\r\ndescription of similar communal establishments which he found in our\r\nday near Uxmal.[993] He holds that the inference of communal living\r\nfrom such data as these is sufficient to warrant a belief in it,\r\nalthough none of the early Spanish writers mention such communism as\r\nexisting; while they actually describe a communal feast in what is\r\nknown as Montezuma’s dinner;[994] and while the plans of the large\r\nbuildings now seen in ruins are exactly in accord with the demands of\r\nseparate families united in joint occupancy. In such groups, he holds,\r\nthere is usually one building devoted to the purpose of a Tecpan, or\r\nofficial house of the tribe.[995] Under the pressure to labor, which\r\nthe Spaniards inflicted on their occupants, these communal dwellers\r\nwere driven, to escape such servitude, into the forest, and thus their\r\nhouses fell into decay. Morgan’s views attracted the adhesion of not\r\na few archæologists, like Bandelier and Dawson; but in Bancroft, as\r\ncontravening the spirit of his _Native Races_, they begat feelings\r\nthat substituted disdain for convincing arguments.[996] The less\r\npassionate controversialists point out, with more effect, how hazardous\r\nit is, in coming to conclusions on the quality of the Nahua, Maya,\r\nor Quiché conditions of life, to ignore such evidences as those of\r\nthe hieroglyphics, the calendars, the architecture and carvings, the\r\nliterature and the industries, as evincing quite another kind, rather\r\nthan degree, of progress, from that of the northern Indians.[997]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES UPON THE RUINS AND ARCHÆOLOGICAL REMAINS OF\r\nMEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA.\r\n\r\nElsewhere in this work some account is given of the comprehensive\r\ntreatment of American antiquities. It is the purpose of this note to\r\ncharacterize such other descriptions as have been specially confined\r\nto the antiquities of Mexico, Central America, and adjacent parts;\r\ntogether with noting occasionally those more comprehensive works which\r\nhave sections on these regions. The earliest and most distinguished of\r\nall such treatises are the writings of Alexander von Humboldt,[998] to\r\nwhom may be ascribed the paternity of what the French define as the\r\nScience of Americanism, which, however, took more definite shape and\r\ninvited discipleship when the Société Américaine de France was formed,\r\nand Aubin in his _Mémoire sur la peinture didactique et l’écriture\r\nfigurative des Anciens Méxicains_ furnished a standard of scholarship.\r\nHow new this science was may be deduced from the fact that Robertson,\r\nthe most distinguished authority on early American history, who wrote\r\nin English, in the last part of the preceding century, had ventured to\r\nsay that in all New Spain there was not “a single monument or vestige\r\nof any building more ancient than the Conquest.” After Humboldt,\r\nthe most famous of what may be called the pioneers of this art were\r\nKingsborough, Dupaix, and Waldeck, whose publications are sufficiently\r\ndescribed elsewhere. The most startling developments came from the\r\nexpeditions of Stephens and Catherwood, the former mingling both in his\r\n_Central America_ and _Yucatan_ the charms of a personal narrative with\r\nhis archæological studies, while the draughtsman, beside furnishing\r\nthe sketches for Stephens’s book, embodied his drawings on a larger\r\nscale in the publication which passes under his own name.[999] The\r\nexplorations of Charnay are those which have excited the most interest\r\nof late years, though equally significant results have been produced by\r\nsuch special explorers as Squier in Nicaragua, Le Plongeon in Yucatan,\r\nand Bandelier in Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe labors of the French archæologist, which began in 1858, resulted\r\nin the work _Cités et ruines Américaines: Mitla, Palenqué, Izamal,\r\nChichen-Itza, Uxmal, recueillies et photographiées par Désiré\r\nCharnay, avec un Texte par M. Viollet le Duc_. (Paris, 1863.) Charnay\r\ncontributed to this joint publication, beside the photographs, a paper\r\ncalled “Le Méxique, 1858-61,—souvenirs et impressions de Voyage.” The\r\nArchitect Viollet le Duc gives us in the same book an essay by an\r\nactive, well-equipped, and ingenious mind, but his speculations about\r\nthe origin of this Southern civilization and its remains are rather\r\ncurious than convincing.[1000]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PYRAMID OF CHOLULA.\r\n\r\nAfter a drawing in Cumplido’s Spanish translation of Prescott’s\r\n_Mexico_, vol. iii. (Mexico, 1846.)]\r\n\r\nThe public began to learn better what Charnay’s full and hearty\r\nconfidence in his own sweeping assertions was, when he again entered\r\nthe field in a series of papers on the ruins of Central America\r\nwhich he contributed (1879-81) to the _North American Review_ (vols.\r\ncxxxi.-cxxxiii.), and which for the most part reached the public\r\nnewly dressed in some of the papers contributed by L. P. Gratacap to\r\nthe American Antiquarian,[1001] and in a paper by F. A. Ober on “The\r\nAncient Cities of America,” in the _Amer. Geog. Soc. Bulletin_, Mar.,\r\n1888. Charnay took moulds of various sculptures found among the ruins,\r\nwhich were placed in the Trocadero Museum in Paris.[1002] What Charnay\r\ncommunicated in English to the _No. Amer. Review_ appeared in better\r\nshape in French in the _Tour du Monde_ (1886-87), and in a still\r\nriper condition in his latest work, _Les anciens villes du Nouveau\r\nMonde: voyages d’explorations au Méxique et dans l’Amérique Centrale_.\r\n1857-1882. _Ouvrage contenant 214 gravures et 19 cartes ou plans._\r\n(Paris, 1885.)[1003]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT MOUND OF CHOLULA.\r\n\r\nAfter a sketch in Bandelier’s _Archæological Tour_, p. 233, who also\r\ngives a plan of the mound. The modern Church of Nuestra Señora de los\r\nRemedios is on the summit, where there are no traces of aboriginal\r\nworks. A paved road leads to the top. A suburban road skirts its base,\r\nand fields of maguey surround it. The circuit of the base is 3859 feet,\r\nand the mound covers nearly twenty acres. Estimates of its height are\r\nvariously given from 165 to 208 feet, according as one or another base\r\nline is chosen. It is built of adobe brick laid in clay, and it has\r\nsuffered from erosion, slides, and other effects of time. There are\r\nsome traces of steps up the side. Bandelier (pl. xv.) also gives a\r\nfac-simile of an old map of Cholula. The earliest picture which we have\r\nof the mound, evidently thought by the first Spaniards to be a natural\r\none, is in the arms of Cholula (1540). There are other modern cuts in\r\nCarbajal-Espinosa’s _Mexico_ (i. 195); _Archæologia Americana_ (i. 12);\r\nBrocklehurst’s _Mexico to-day_, 182. The degree of restoration which\r\ndraughtsmen allow to themselves, accounts in large measure for the\r\ngreat diversity of appearance which the mound makes in the different\r\ndrawings of it. There is a professed restoration by Mothes in Armin’s\r\n_Heutige Mexico_, 63, 68, 72. The engraving in Humboldt is really a\r\nrestoration (_Vues_, etc., pl. vii., or pl. viii. of the folio ed.).\r\nBandelier gives a slight sketch of a restoration (p. 246, pl. viii.).]\r\n\r\nWe proceed now to note geographically some of the principal ruins. In\r\nthe vicinity of Vera Cruz the pyramid of Papantla is the conspicuous\r\nmonument,[1004] but there is little else thereabouts needing particular\r\nmention. Among the ruins of the central plateau of Mexico, the famous\r\npyramid of Cholula is best known. The time of its construction is a\r\nmatter about which archæologists are not agreed, though it is perhaps\r\nto be connected with the earliest period of the Nahua power. Duran,\r\non the other hand, has told a story of its erection by the giants,\r\novercome by the Nahuas.[1005] Its purpose is equally debatable, whether\r\nintended for a memorial, a refuge, a defence, or a spot of worship—very\r\nlikely the truth may be divided among them all.[1006] It is a similar\r\nproblem for divided opinion whether it was built by a great display of\r\nhuman energy, in accordance with the tradition that the bricks which\r\ncomposed its surface were passed from hand to hand by a line of men,\r\nextending to the spot where they were made leagues away, or constructed\r\nby a slower process of accretion, spread over successive generations,\r\nwhich might not have required any marvellous array of workmen.[1007]\r\nThe fierce conflict which—as some hold—Cortés had with the natives\r\naround the mound and on its slopes settled its fate; and the demolition\r\nbegun thereupon, and continued by the furious desolaters of the Church,\r\nhas been aided by the erosions of time and the hand of progress,\r\ntill the great monument has become a ragged and corroded hill, which\r\nmight to the casual observer stand for the natural base, given by\r\nthe Creator, to the modern chapel that now crowns its summit; but if\r\nBandelier’s view (p. 249) is correct, that none of the conquerors\r\nmention it, then the conflict which is recorded took place, not here,\r\nbut on the vanished mound of Quetzalcoatl, which in Bandelier’s opinion\r\nwas a different structure from this more famous mound, while other\r\nwriters pronounce it the shrine itself of Quetzalcoatl.[1008]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEXICAN CALENDAR STONE.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in _Harper’s Magazine_. An enlarged engraving of the\r\ncentral head is given on the title-page of the present volume. A\r\nphotographic reproduction, as the “Stone of the Sun,” is given in\r\nBandelier’s _Archæological Tour_, p. 54, where he summarizes the\r\nhistory of it, with references, including a paper by Alfredo Chavero,\r\nin the _Anales del Museo nacional de México_, and another, with a cut,\r\nby P. J. J. Valentini, in _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, April, 1878, and\r\nin _The Nation_, Aug. 8 and Sept. 19, 1878. Chavero’s explanation is\r\ntranslated in Brocklehurst’s _Mexico to-day_, p. 186. The stone is\r\ndated in a year corresponding to A.D. 1479, and it was early described\r\nin Duran’s _Historia de las Indias_, and in Tezozomoc’s _Crónica\r\nmexicana_. Tylor (_Anahuac_, 238) says that of the drawings made before\r\nthe days of photography, that in Carlos Nebel’s _Viaje pintoresco y\r\nArqueológico sobre la República Mejicana_, 1829-1834 (Paris, 1839),\r\nis the best, while the engravings given by Humboldt (pl. xxiii.)\r\nand others are more or less erroneous.

Repts._,\r\nii. 572, for a comparison of calendars.\r\n\r\nWilson in his _Prehistoric Man_ (i. 246) says: “By the unaided results\r\nof native science, the dwellers on the Mexican plateau had effected\r\nan adjustment of civil to solar time so nearly correct that when the\r\nSpaniards landed on their coast, their own reckoning, according to the\r\nunreformed Julian calendar, was really eleven days in error, compared\r\nwith that of the barbarian nation whose civilization they so speedily\r\neffaced.”\r\n\r\nSee what Wilson (_Prehistoric Man_, i. 333) says of the native\r\nveneration for this calendar stone, when it was exhumed. Mrs. Nuttall\r\n(_Proc. Am. Asso. Adv. Sci._, Aug., 1886) claims to be able to show\r\nthat this monolith is really a stone which stood in the Mexican\r\nmarket-place, and was used in regulating the stated market-days.]\r\n\r\nWe have reference to a Cholula mound in some of the earliest writers.\r\nBernal Diaz counted the steps on its side.[1009] Motolinía saw it\r\nwithin ten years of the Conquest, when it was overgrown and much\r\nruined. Sahagún says it was built for defensive purposes. Rojas, in\r\nhis _Relacion de Cholula_, 1581, calls it a fortress, and says the\r\nSpaniards levelled its convex top to plant there a cross, where later,\r\nin 1594, they built a chapel. Torquemada, following Motolinía and the\r\nlater Mendieta, says it was never finished, and was decayed in his\r\ntime, though he traced the different levels. Its interest as a relic\r\nthus dates almost from the beginnings of the modern history of the\r\nregion. Boturini mentions its four terraces. Clavigero, in 1744, rode\r\nup its sides on horseback, impelled by curiosity, and found it hard\r\nwork even then to look upon it as other than a natural hill.[1010] The\r\nearliest of the critical accounts of it, however, is Humboldt’s, made\r\nfrom examinations in 1803, when much more than now of its original\r\nconstruction was observable, and his account is the one from which most\r\ntravellers have drawn,—the result of close scrutiny in his text and of\r\nconsiderable license in his plate, in which he aimed at something like\r\na restoration.[1011] The latest critical examination is in Bandelier’s\r\n“Studies about Cholula and its vicinity,” making part iii. of his\r\n_Archæological Tour in Mexico in 1881_.[1012]\r\n\r\nWhat are called the finest ruins in Mexico are those of Xochicalco,\r\nseventy-five miles southwest of the capital, consisting of a mound of\r\nfive terraces supported by masonry, with a walled area on the summit.\r\nOf late years a cornfield surrounds what is left of the pyramidal\r\nstructure, which was its crowning edifice, and which up to the middle\r\nof the last century had five receding stories, though only one now\r\nappears. It owes its destruction to the needs which the proprietors\r\nof the neighboring sugar-works have had for its stones. The earliest\r\naccount of the ruins appeared in the “Descripcion (1791) de los\r\nantiqüedades de Xochicalco” of José Antonio Alzate y Ramirez, in the\r\n_Gacetas de Literatura_ (Mexico, 1790-94, in 3 vols.; reprinted Puebla,\r\n1831, in 4 vols.), accompanied by plates, which were again used in\r\nPietro Marquez’s _Due Antichi Monumenti de Architettura Messicana_\r\n(Roma, 1804),[1013] with an Italian version of Alzate, from which the\r\nFrench translation in Dupaix was made. Alzate furnished the basis of\r\nthe account in Humboldt’s _Vues_ (i. 129; pl. ix. of folio ed.), and\r\nWaldeck (_Voyage pitt._, 69) regrets that Humboldt adopted so inexact\r\na description as that of Alzate. From Nebel (_Viage pintoresco_) we\r\nget our best graphic representations, for Tylor (_Anahuac_) says that\r\nCasteñeda’s drawings, accompanying Dupaix, are very incorrect. Bancroft\r\nsays that one, at least, of these drawings in Kingsborough bears not\r\nthe slightest resemblance to the one given in Dupaix. In 1835 there\r\nwere explorations made under orders of the Mexican government, which\r\nwere published in the _Revista Mexicana_ (i. 539,—reprinted in the\r\n_Diccionario Universal_, x. 938). Other accounts, more or less helpful,\r\nare given by Latrobe, Mayer,[1014] and in Isador Löwenstern’s _Le\r\nMéxique_ (Paris, 1843).[1015]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COURT IN THE MEXICO MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The opposite view of the court of the Museum is from Charnay, p.\r\n57. He says: “The Museum cannot be called rich, in so far that there\r\nis nothing remarkable in what the visitor is allowed to see.” The\r\nvases, which had so much deceived Charnay, earlier, as to cause him to\r\nmake casts of them for the Paris Museum, he at a later day pronounced\r\nforgeries; and he says that they, with many others which are seen in\r\npublic and private museums, were manufactured at Tlatiloco, a Mexican\r\nsuburb, between 1820 and 1828. See Holmes on the trade in Mexican\r\nspurious relics in _Science_, 1886.\r\n\r\nThe reclining statue in the foreground is balanced by one similar to\r\nit at an opposite part of the court-yard. One is the Chac-mool, as Le\r\nPlongeon called it, unearthed by him at Chichen-Itza, and appropriated\r\nby the Mexican government; the other was discovered at Tlaxcala.\r\n\r\nThe round stone in the centre is the sacrificial stone dug up in the\r\ngreat square in Mexico, of which an enlarged view is given on another\r\npage.\r\n\r\nThe museum is described in Bancroft, iv. 554; in Mayer’s _Mexico as it\r\nwas_, etc., and his _Mexico, Aztec, etc._; Fossey’s _Mexique_.\r\n\r\nOn Le Plongeon’s discovery of the Chac-mool see _Amer. Antiq. Soc.\r\nProc._, Apr., 1877; Oct., 1878, and new series, i. 280; Nadaillac, Eng.\r\ntr., 346; Short, 400; Le Plongeon’s _Sacred Mysteries_, 88, and his\r\npaper in the _Amer. Geog. Soc. Journal_, ix. 142 (1877). Hamy calls\r\nit the Toltec god Tlaloc, the rain-god; and Charnay agrees with him,\r\ngiving (pp. 366-7) cuts of his and of the one found at Tlaxcala.]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Anahuac corresponds mainly to the valley of Mexico\r\ncity.[1016] Bancroft (iv. 497) shows in a summary way the extent of\r\nour knowledge of the scant archæological remains within this central\r\narea.[1017]\r\n\r\nIn the city of Mexico not a single relic of the architecture of the\r\nearlier peoples remains,[1018] though a few movable sculptured objects\r\nare preserved.[1019]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD MEXICAN BRIDGE NEAR TEZCUCO.\r\n\r\nAfter a sketch in Tylor’s _Anahuac_, who thinks it the original _Puente\r\nde las Bergantinas_, where Cortes had his brigantines launched. The\r\nspan is about 20 feet, and this Tylor thinks “an immense span for such\r\na construction.” Cf. H. H. Bancroft, _Native Races_, iv. 479, 528.\r\nBandelier (_Peabody Mus. Reports_, ii. 696) doubts its antiquity.]\r\n\r\nTezcuco, on the other side of the lake from Mexico, affords some\r\ntraces of the ante-Conquest architecture, but has revealed no\r\nsuch interesting movable relics as have been found in the capital\r\ncity.[1020] Twenty-five miles north of Mexico are the ruins of\r\nTeotihuacan, which have been abundantly described by early writers and\r\nmodern explorers. Bancroft (iv. 530) makes up his summary mainly from\r\na Mexican official account, Ramon Almaraz’s _Memoria de los trabajos\r\nejecutados por la comision cientifica de Pachuca_ (Mexico, 1865),\r\nadding what was needed to fill out details from Clavigero, Humboldt,\r\nand the later writers.[1021]\r\n\r\nBancroft (iv. ch. 10), in describing what is known of the remains in\r\nthe northern parts of Mexico, gives a summary of what has been written\r\nregarding the most famous of these ruins, Quemada in Zacatecas.[1022]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INDIO TRISTE.\r\n\r\nAfter a photograph in Bandelier’s _Archæological Tour_, p. 68. He\r\nthinks it was intended to be a bearer of a torch, and has no symbolical\r\nmeaning.]\r\n\r\nBancroft (iv. ch. 7) has given a separate chapter to the antiquities\r\nof Oajaca (Oaxaca) and Guerrero, as the most southern of what he\r\nterms the Nahua people, including and lying westerly of the Isthmus\r\nof Tehuantepec, and he speaks of it as a region but little known\r\nto travellers, except as they pass through a part of it lying on\r\nthe commercial route from Acapulco to the capital city of Mexico.\r\nBancroft’s summary, with his references, must suffice for the inquirer\r\nfor all except the principal group of ruins in this region, that of\r\nMitla (or Lyó-Baa), of which a full recapitulation of authorities\r\nmay be made, most of which are also to be referred to for the lesser\r\nruins, though, as Bancroft points out, the information respecting Monte\r\nAlban and Zachila is far from satisfactory. Of Monte Alban, Dupaix and\r\nCharnay are the most important witnesses, and the latter says that\r\nhe considers Monte Alban “one of the most precious remains, and very\r\nsurely the most ancient of the American civilizations.”[1023] On Dupaix\r\nalone we must depend for what we know of Zachila.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, of Mitla (sometime Miquitlan, Mictlan) that more\r\nconsiderable mention must be made, and its ruins, about thirty miles\r\nsoutherly from Mexico, have been oftenest visited, as they deserve to\r\nbe; and we have to regret that Stephens never took them within the\r\nrange of his observations. Their demolition had begun during a century\r\nor two previous to the Spanish Conquest, and was not complete even\r\nthen. Nature is gloomy, and even repulsive in its desolation about the\r\nruins;[1024] but a small village still exists among them. The place is\r\nmentioned by Duran[1025] as inhabited about 1450; Motolinía describes\r\nit as still lived in,[1026] and in 1565-74 it had a gobernador of its\r\nown. Burgoa speaks of it in 1644.[1027]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL PLAN OF MITLA. After Bandelier’s sketch\r\n(_Archæological Tour_, p. 276). KEY:\r\n\r\n  A, the ruins on the highest ground, with a church and curacy built\r\n  into the walls.\r\n  B, C, E, are ruins outside the village.\r\n  D is within the modern village.\r\n  F is beyond the river.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the modern explorers were Luis Martin, a Mexican\r\narchitect, and Colonel de la Laguna, who examined the ruins in\r\n1802; and it was from Martin and his drawings that Humboldt drew\r\nthe information with which, in 1810, he first engaged the attention\r\nof the general public upon Mitla, in his _Vues des Cordillères_.\r\nDupaix’s visit was in 1806. The architect Eduard L. Mühlenpfordt,\r\nin his _Versuch einer getreuen Schilderung der Republik Mejico_\r\n(Hannover, 1844, in 2 vols.), says that he made plans and drawings in\r\n1830,[1028] which, passing into the hands of Juan B. Carriedo, were\r\nused by him to illustrate a paper, “Los palacios antiguos de Mitla,”\r\nin the _Ilustracion Mexicana_ (vol. ii.), in which he set forth the\r\ncondition of the ruins in 1852. Meanwhile, in 1837, some drawings had\r\nbeen made, which were twenty years later reproduced in the ninth volume\r\nof the _Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge_, as Brantz Mayer’s\r\n_Observations on Mexican history and archæology, with a special notice\r\nof Zapotec, remains as delineated in Mr. J. G. Sawkins’s drawings of\r\nMitla, etc._ (Washington, 1857). Bancroft points out (iv. 406) that\r\nthe inaccuracies and impossibilities of Sawkins’ drawings are such\r\nas to lead to the conclusion that he pretended to explorations which\r\nhe never made, and probably drafted his views from some indefinite\r\ninformation; and that Mayer was deceived, having no more precise\r\nstatements than Humboldt’s by which to test the drawings. Matthieu\r\nFossey visited the ruins in 1838; but his account in his _Le Méxique_\r\n(Paris, 1857) is found by Bancroft to be mainly a borrowed one. G. F.\r\nvon Tempsky’s _Mitla, a narrative of incidents and personal adventure\r\non a journey in Mexico, Guatemala and Salvador, 1853-1855, edited by\r\nJ. S. Bell_ (London, 1858), deceives us by the title into supposing\r\nthat considerable attention is given in the book to Mitla, but we\r\nfind him spending but a part of a day there in February, 1854 (p.\r\n250). The book is not prized; Bandelier calls it of small scientific\r\nvalue, and Bancroft says his plates must have been made up from other\r\nsources than his own observations.[1029] Charnay, here, as well as\r\nelsewhere, made for us some important photographs in 1859.[1030] This\r\nkind of illustration received new accessions of value when Emilio\r\nHerbrüger issued a series of thirty-four fine plates as _Album de\r\nVistas fotográficas de las Antiguas Ruinas de los palacios de Mitla_\r\n(Oaxaca, 1874). In 1864, J. W. von Müller, in his _Reisen in den\r\nVereinigten Staaten, Canada und Mexico_ (Leipzig, in 3 vols.), included\r\nan account of a visit.[1031] The most careful examination made since\r\nBancroft summarized existing knowledge is that of Bandelier in his\r\n_Archæological Tour in Mexico in 1881_ (Boston, 1885), published as\r\nno. ii. of the American series of the _Papers of the Archæological\r\nInstitute of America_, which is illustrated with heliotypes and sketch\r\nplans of the ruins and architectural details in all their geometrical\r\nsymmetry. Bancroft (iv. 392, etc.) could only give a plan of the ruins\r\nbased on the sketches of Mühlenpfordt as published by Carriedo, but the\r\nstudent will find a more careful one[1032] in Bandelier, who also gives\r\ndetailed ones of the several buildings (pl. xvii., xviii.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SACRIFICIAL STONE.\r\n\r\nAfter a photograph in Bandelier’s _Archæological Tour_, p. 67. See on\r\nanother page, cut of the court-yard of the Museum, where this stone is\r\npreserved. Cf. Humboldt, pl. xxi.; Bandelier in _Amer. Antiq_., 1878;\r\nBancroft, iv. 509; Stevens’s _Flint Chips_, 311. There is a discussion\r\nof the stone in Orozco y Berra’s _El Cuauhxicalli de Tizoc_, in the\r\n_Anales del Museo Nacional_, i. no. 1; ii. no. 1. On the sacrificial\r\nstone of San Juan Teotihuacan, see paper by Amos W. Butler in the\r\n_Amer. Antiq_., vii. 148. A cut in Clavigero (ii.) shows how the stone\r\nwas used in sacrifices; the engraving has been often copied. In Mrs.\r\nNuttall’s view this stone simply records the periodical tribute days\r\n(_Am. Ass. Adv. Sci. Proc._, Aug. 1886).]\r\n\r\nThere is no part of Spanish America richer in architectural remains\r\nthan the northern section of Yucatan, and Bancroft (iv. ch. 5) has\r\noccasion to enumerate and to describe with more or less fullness\r\nbetween fifty and sixty independent groups of ruins.[1033] Stephens\r\nexplored forty-four of these abandoned towns, and such was the native\r\nignorance that of only a few of them could anything be learned\r\nin Merida. And yet that this country was the land of a peculiar\r\narchitecture was known to the earliest explorers. Francisco Hernandez\r\nde Cordova in 1517, Juan de Grijalva in 1518, Cortés himself in 1519,\r\nand Francisco de Montejo in 1527 observed the ruins in Cozumel, an\r\nisland off the northwest coast of the peninsula, and at other points of\r\nthe shore.[1034] It is only, however, within the present century that\r\nwe have had any critical notices. Rio heard reports of them merely.\r\nLorenzo de Zavala saw only Uxmal, as his account given in Dupaix shows.\r\nThe earliest detailed descriptions were those of Waldeck in his _Voyage\r\npittoresque et achéologique dans la province d’Yucatan_ (Paris, 1838,\r\nfolio, with steel plates and lithographs), but he also saw little more\r\nthan the ruins of Uxmal, in the expedition in which he had received\r\npecuniary support from Lord Kingsborough.[1035] It is to John L.\r\nStephens and his accompanying draughtsman, Frederic Catherwood, that\r\nwe owe by far the most essential part of our knowledge of the Yucatan\r\nremains. He had begun a survey of Uxmal in 1840, but had made little\r\nprogress when the illness of his artist broke up his plans. Accordingly\r\nhe gave the world but partial results in his _Incidents of Travel in\r\nCentral America_. Not satisfied with his imperfect examination, he\r\nreturned to Yucatan in 1841, and in 1843 published at New York the\r\nbook which has become the main source of information for all compilers\r\never since, his _Incidents of Travel in Yucatan_ (N. Y., 1842; London,\r\n1843; again, N. Y., 1856, 1858). It was in the early days of the\r\nDaguerrean process, and Catherwood took with him a camera, from which\r\nhis excellent drawings derive some of their fidelity. They appeared in\r\nhis own _Views of Ancient Monuments in Central America_ (N. Y., 1844),\r\non a larger scale than in Stephens’s smaller pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALDECK.\r\n\r\nAfter an etching published in the _Annuaire de la Soc. Amer. de\r\nFrance_. Cf. _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, October, 1875.]\r\n\r\nStephens’s earlier book had had an almost immediate success. The\r\nreviewers were unanimous in commendation, as they might well be.[1036]\r\nIt has been asserted that it was in order to avail of this new\r\ninterest that a resident of New Orleans, Mr. B. M. Norman, hastened\r\nto Yucatan, while Stephens was there a second time, and during the\r\nwinter of 1841-42 made the trip among the ruins, which is recorded in\r\nhis _Rambles in Yucatan, or Notes of Travel through the peninsula,\r\nincluding a Visit to the Remarkable Ruins of Chi-chen, Kabah Zayi, and\r\nUxmal_ (New York, 1843).[1037]\r\n\r\nThe Daguerrean camera was also used by the Baron von Friederichsthal\r\nin his studies at Uxmal and Chichen-Itza, and his exploration seems\r\nto have taken place between the two visits of Stephens, as Bancroft\r\ndetermines from a letter (April 21, 1841) written after the baron had\r\nstarted on his return voyage to Europe.[1038] In Paris, in October,\r\n1841, under the introduction of Humboldt, Friederichsthal addressed\r\nthe Academy, and his paper was printed in the _Nouvelles Annales\r\ndes Voyages_ (xcii. 297) as “Les Monuments de l’Yucatan.”[1039] The\r\ncamera was not, however, brought to the aid of the student with the\r\nmost satisfactory results till Charnay, in 1858, visited Izamal,\r\nChichen-Itza, and Uxmal. He gave a foretaste of his results in the\r\n_Bulletin de la Soc. de Géog_. (1861, vol. ii. 364), and in 1863\r\ngave not very extended descriptions, relying mostly on his _Atlas_\r\nof photographs in his _Cités et Ruines Américaines_, a part of which\r\nvolume consists of the architectural speculations of Viollet le Duc.\r\nBeside the farther studies of Charnay in his _Anciens Villes du Nouveau\r\nMonde_ (Paris, 1885), there have been recent explorations in Yucatan\r\nby Dr. Augustus Le Plongeon and his wife, mainly at Chichen-Itza,\r\nin which for a while he had the aid and countenance of Mr. Stephen\r\nSalisbury, Jr.,[1040] of Worcester, Mass. Le Plongeon’s results are\r\ndecidedly novel and helpful, but they were expressed with more license\r\nof explication than satisfied the committee of that society, when his\r\npapers were referred to them for publication, and than has proved\r\nacceptable to other examiners.[1041] Nearly all other descriptions of\r\nthe Yucatan ruins have been derived substantially from these chief\r\nauthorities.[1042]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DÉSIRÉ CHARNAY.\r\n\r\nReproduced from an engraving in the\r\nLondon edition, 1887, of the English translation of his _Ancient Cities\r\nof the New World_.]\r\n\r\nThe principal ruins of Yucatan are those of Uxmal and Chichen-Itza,\r\nand references to the literature of each will suffice. Those at\r\nUxmal are in some respects distinct in character from the remains of\r\nHonduras and of Chiapas. There are no idols as at Copan. There are no\r\nextensive stucco-work and no tablets as at Palenqué. The general type\r\nis Cyclopean masonry, faced with dressed stones. The Casa de Monjas,\r\nor nunnery (so called), is often considered the most remarkable ruin\r\nin Central America; and no architectural feature of any of them has\r\nbeen the subject of more inquiry than the protuberant ornaments in the\r\ncornices, which are usually called elephants’ trunks.[1043] It has been\r\ncontended that the place was inhabited in the days of Cortes.[1044]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM CHARNAY.\r\n\r\nAlso in the _Bull. Soc. de Géog. de Paris_, 1882 (p. 542). The best\r\nlarge (36 × 28 in.) topographical and historical map of Yucatan,\r\nshowing the site of ruins, is that of Huebbe and Azuar, 1878. The\r\n_Plano de Yucatan_, of Santiago Nigra de San Martin, also showing the\r\nruins, 1848, is reduced in Stephen Salisbury’s _Mayas_ (Worcester,\r\n1877), or in the _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, April, 1876, and April,\r\n1877. V. A. Malte-Brun’s map, likewise marking the ruins, is in\r\nBrasseur de Bourbourg’s _Palenqué_ (1866). There are maps in C. G.\r\nFancourt’s _Hist. Yucatan_ (London, 1854); Dupaix’s _Antiquités\r\nMéxicaines_; Waldeck’s _Voyage dans la Yucatan_ (his MS. map was used\r\nby Malte-Brun). Cf. the map of Yucatan and Chiapas, in Brasseur and\r\nWaldeck’s _Monuments Anciens du Méxique_ (1866). Perhaps the most\r\nconvenient map to use in the study of Maya antiquities is that in\r\nBancroft’s _Nat. Races_, iv. Cf. Crescentio Carrillo’s “Geografía Maya”\r\nin the _Anales del Museo nacional de México_, ii. 435.\r\n\r\nThe map in Stephens’s _Yucatan_, vol. i., shows his route among the\r\nruins, but does not pretend to be accurate for regions off his course.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal of the Royal Geog. Soc._, vol. xi., has a map showing the\r\nruins in Central America.\r\n\r\nThe best map to show at a glance the location of the ruins in the\r\nlarger field of Spanish America is in Bancroft’s _Nat. Races_, iv.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest printed account of Uxmal is in Cogolludo’s _Yucathan_\r\n(Madrid, 1688), pp. 176, 193, 197; but it was well into this century\r\nbefore others were written. Lorenzo de Zavala gave but an outline\r\naccount in his _Notice_, printed in Dupaix in 1834. Waldeck (_Voyage\r\nPitt._ 67, 93) spent eight days there in May, 1835, and Stephens gives\r\nhim the credit of being the earliest describer to attract attention.\r\nStephens’s first visit in 1840 was hasty (_Cent. Amer._, ii. 413), but\r\non his second visit (1842) he took with him Waldeck’s _Voyage_, and his\r\ndescription and the drawings of Catherwood were made with the advantage\r\nof having these earlier drawings to compare. Stephens (_Yucatan_,\r\ni. 297) says that their plans and drawings differ materially from\r\nWaldeck’s; but Bancroft, who compares the two, says that Stephens\r\nexaggerated the differences, which are not material, except in a few\r\nplates (Stephens’s _Yucatan_, i. 163; ii. 264—ch. 24, 25). About the\r\nsame time Norman and Friederichsthal made their visits. Bancroft\r\n(iv. 150) refers to the lesser narratives of Carillo (1845), and\r\nanother, recorded in the _Registro Yucateco_ (i. 273, 361), with Carl\r\nBartholomæus Heller (April, 1847) in his _Reisen in Mexico_ (Leipzig,\r\n1853). Charnay’s _Ruines_ (p. 362), and his _Anciens Villes_ (ch. 19,\r\n20), record visits in 1858 and later. Brasseur reported upon Uxmal in\r\n1865 in the _Archives de la Com. Scientifique du Méxique_ (ii. 234,\r\n254), and he had already made mention of them in his _Hist. Nations\r\nCiv._, ii. ch. 1.[1045]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINED TEMPLE AT UXMAL.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in Ruge’s _Gesch. des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen_, p. 357.]\r\n\r\nThe ruins of Chichen-Itza make part of the eastern group of the Yucatan\r\nremains. As was not the case with some of the other principal ruins,\r\nthe city in its prime has a record in Maya tradition; it was known in\r\nthe days of the Conquest, and has not been lost sight of since,[1046]\r\nthough its ruins were not visited by explorers till well within the\r\npresent century, the first of whom, according to Stephens, was John\r\nBurke, in 1838. Stephens had heard of them and mentioned them to\r\nFriederichsthal, who was there in 1840 (_Nouv. Annales des Voyages_,\r\nxcii. 300-306). Norman was there in February, 1842 (_Rambles_, 104),\r\nand did not seem aware that any one had been there before him; and\r\nStephens himself, during the next month (_Yucatan_, ii. 282), made\r\nthe best record which we have. Charnay made his observations in 1858\r\n(_Ruines_, 339,—cf. _Anciens Villes_, ch. 18), and gives us nine good\r\nphotographs. The latest discoverer is Le Plongeon, whose investigations\r\nwere signalized by the finding (1876) of the statue of Chackmool, and\r\nby other notable researches (_Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, April, 1877;\r\nOctober, 1878).[1047]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM CHICHEN-ITZA.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in Squier’s _Serpent Symbol_. There are two of these rings\r\nin the walls of one of the buildings twenty or thirty feet from the\r\nground. They are four feet in diameter. Cf. Stephens’s _Yucatan_, ii.\r\n304; Bancroft, iv. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM CHICHEN-ITZA.\r\n\r\nA bas-relief, one of the best preserved at Chichen-Itza, after a sketch\r\nin Charnay and Viollet-le-Duc’s _Cités et Ruines Américaines_ (Paris,\r\n1863), p. 53, of which Viollet-le-Duc says: “Le profil du guerrier se\r\nrapproche sensiblement les types du Nord de l’Europe.”]\r\n\r\nIt seems hardly to admit of doubt that the cities—if that be their\r\nproper designation—of Yucatan were the work of the Maya people,\r\nwhose descendants were found by the Spaniards in possession of the\r\npeninsula, and that in some cases, like those of Uxmal and Toloom,\r\ntheir sacred edifices did not cease to be used till some time after\r\nthe Spaniards had possessed the country. Such were the conclusions of\r\nStephens,[1048] the sanest mind that has spent its action upon these\r\nremains; and he tells us that a deed of the region where Uxmal is\r\nsituated, which passed in 1673, mentions the daily religious rites\r\nwhich the natives were then celebrating there, and speaks of the\r\nswinging doors and cisterns then in use. The abandonment of one of the\r\nbuildings, at least, is brought down to within about two centuries,\r\nand comparisons of Catherwood’s drawings with the descriptions of\r\nmore recent explorers, by showing a very marked deterioration within\r\na comparatively few years, enable us easily to understand how the\r\npiercing roots of a rapidly growing vegetation can make a greater havoc\r\nin a century than will occur in temperate climates. The preservation\r\nof paint on the walls, and of wooden lintels in some places, also\r\ninduce a belief that no great time, such as would imply an extinct\r\nrace of builders, is necessary to account for the present condition\r\nof the ruins, and we must always remember how the Spaniards used them\r\nas quarries for building their neighboring towns. How long these\r\nhabitations and shrines stood in their perfection is a question\r\nabout which archæologists have had many and diverse estimates,\r\nranging from hundreds to thousands of years. There is nothing in the\r\nruins themselves to settle the question, beyond a study of their\r\nconstruction. So far as the traditionary history of the Mayas can\r\ndetermine, some of them may have been built between the third and the\r\ntenth century.[1049]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe come now to Chiapas. The age of the ruins of Palenqué[1050] can\r\nonly be conjectured, and very indefinitely, though perhaps there\r\nis not much risk in saying that they represent some of the oldest\r\narchitectural structures known in the New World, and were very likely\r\nabandoned three or four centuries before the coming of the Spaniards.\r\nStill, any confident statement is unwise. Perhaps there may be some\r\nfitness in Brasseur’s belief that the stucco additions and roofs were\r\nthe work of a later people than those who laid the foundations.[1051]\r\nBancroft (iv. 289) has given the fullest account of the literature\r\ndescribing these ruins. They seem to have been first found in 1750,\r\nor a few years before. The report reaching Ramon de Ordoñez, then a\r\nboy, was not forgotten by him, and prompted him to send his brother in\r\n1773 to explore them. Among the manuscripts in the Brasseur Collection\r\n(_Bib. Mex.-Guat._, p. 113; Pinart, no. 695) are a _Memoria relativa à\r\nlas ruinas... de Palenqué_, and _Notas de Chiapas y Palenqué_, which\r\nare supposed to be the record of this exploration written by Ramon,\r\nas copied from the original in the Museo Nacional, and which, in part\r\nat least, constituted the report which Ramon made in 1784 to the\r\npresident of the Audiencia Real. Ramon’s view was that he had hit upon\r\nthe land of Ophir, and the country visited by the Phœnicians. This\r\nsame president now directed José Antonio Calderon to visit the ruins,\r\nand we have his “Informe” translated in Brasseur’s _Palenqué_ (introd.\r\np. 5). From February to June of 1785, Antonio Benasconi, the royal\r\narchitect of Guatemala, inspected the ruins under similar orders. His\r\nreport, as well as the preceding one, with the accompanying drawings,\r\nwere dispatched to Spain, where J. B. Muñoz made a summary of them for\r\nthe king. I do not find any of them have been printed. The result of\r\nthe royal interest in the matter was, that Antonio del Rio was next\r\ncommissioned to make a more thorough survey, which he accomplished\r\n(May-June, 1787) with the aid of a band of natives to fell the trees\r\nand fire the rubbish. He broke through the walls in a reckless way,\r\nthat added greatly to the devastation of years. Rio’s report, dated\r\nat Palenqué June 24, 1787, was published first in 1855, in the\r\n_Diccionario Univ. de Geog._, viii. 528.[1052] Meanwhile, beside the\r\ncopy of the manuscript sent to Spain, other manuscripts were kept in\r\nGuatemala and Mexico; and one of these falling into the hands of a Dr.\r\nM’Quy, was taken to England and translated under the title _Description\r\nof the Ruins of an Ancient City discovered near Palenque in Guatemala,\r\nSpanish America, translated from the Original MS. Report of Capt.\r\nDon A. Del Rio; followed by Teatro Critico Americano, or a Critical\r\nInvestigation and Research into the History of the Americans, by Doctor\r\nFelix Cabrera_ (London, 1822).[1053]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RESTORATION BY VIOLLET-LE-DUC.\r\n\r\nFrom _Histoire de l’Habitation Humaine, par Viollet-le-Duc_ (Paris,\r\n1875). There is a restoration of the Palenqué palace—so called—in\r\nArmin’s _Das heutige Mexico_ (copied in Short, 342, and Bancroft, iv.\r\n323).]\r\n\r\nThe results of the explorations of Dupaix, made early in the present\r\ncentury by order of Carlos IV. of Spain, long remained unpublished. His\r\nreport and the drawings of Castañeda lay uncared for in the Mexican\r\narchives during the period of the Revolution. Latour Allard, of Paris,\r\nobtained copies of some of the drawings, and from these Kingsborough\r\ngot copies, which he engraved for his _Mexican Antiquities_, in which\r\nDupaix’s report was also printed in Spanish and English (vols. iv.,\r\nv., vi.). It is not quite certain whether the originals or copies\r\nwere delivered (1828) by the Mexican authorities to Baradère, who\r\na few years later secured their publication with additional matter\r\nas _Antiquités méxicaines_. _Relation des trois expéditions du\r\ncapitaine Dupaix, ordonnées en 1805, 1806 et 1807, pour la recherche\r\ndes antiquités du pays, notamment celles de Mitla et de Palenque;\r\naccompagnée des dessins de Castañeda, et d’une carte du pays exploré;\r\nsuivie d’un parallèle de ces monuments avec ceux de l’Égypte, de\r\nl’Indostan, et du reste de l’ancien monde par Alexandre Lenoir; d’une\r\ndissertation sur l’origine de l’ancienne population des deux Amériques\r\npar [D. B.] Warden; avec un discours préliminaire par. M. Charles\r\nFarcy, et des notes explicatives, et autres documents par MM. Baradère,\r\nde St. Priest [etc.]._ (Paris 1834, texte et atlas.)[1054] The plates\r\nof this edition are superior to those in Kingsborough and in Rio; and\r\nare indeed improved in the engraving over Castañeda’s drawings. The\r\nbook as a whole is one of the most important on Palenqué which we have.\r\nThe investigations were made on his third expedition (1807-8). A tablet\r\ntaken from the ruins by him is in the Museo Nacional, and a cast of it\r\nis figured in the _Numis. and Antiq. Soc. of Philad. Proc._, Dec. 4,\r\n1884.\r\n\r\nDuring the twenty-five years next following Dupaix, we find two\r\ncorrespondents of the French and English Geographical Societies\r\nsupplying their publications with occasional accounts of their\r\nobservations among the ruins. One of them, Dr. F. Corroy,[1055] was\r\nthen living at Tabasco; the other, Col. Juan Gallindo,[1056] was\r\nresident in the country as an administrative officer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCULPTURES, TEMPLE OF THE CROSS, PALENQUÉ.\r\n\r\nThese slabs, six feet high, were taken from Palenqué, and when Stephens\r\nsaw them they were in private hands at San Domingo, near by, but later\r\nthey were placed in the church front in the same town, and here Charnay\r\ntook impressions of them, from which they were engraved in _The Ancient\r\nCities_, etc., p. 217, and copied thence in the above cuts. This same\r\ntype of head is considered by Rosny the Aztec head of Palenqué (_Doc.\r\nécrits de la Antiq. Amer._, 73), and as belonging to the superior\r\nclasses. In order to secure the convex curve of the nose and forehead\r\nan ornament was sometimes added, as shown in a head of the second\r\ntablet at Palenqué, and in the photograph of a bas-relief, preserved\r\nin the Museo Archeologico at Madrid, given by Rosny (vol. 3), and\r\nhypothetically called by him a statue of Cuculkan. This ornament is not\r\ninfrequently seen in other images of this region.\r\n\r\nBandelier (_Peabody Mus. Repts._, ii. 126), speaking of the tablet of\r\nthe Cross of Palenqué, says: “These tablets and figures show in dress\r\nsuch a striking analogy of what we know of the military accoutrements\r\nof the Mexicans, that it is a strong approach to identity.”]\r\n\r\nFréderic de Waldeck, the artist who some years before had familiarized\r\nhimself with the character of the ruins in the preparation of the\r\nengravings for Rio’s work, was employed in 1832-34. He was now\r\nconsiderably over sixty years of age, and under the pay of a committee,\r\nwhich had raised a subscription, in which the Mexican government\r\nshared. He made the most thorough examination of Palenqué which has\r\nyet been made. Waldeck was a skilful artist, and his drawings are\r\nexquisite; but he was not free from a tendency to improve or restore,\r\nwhere the conditions gave a hint, and so as we have them in the final\r\npublication they have not been accepted as wholly trustworthy. He made\r\nmore than 200 drawings, and either the originals or copies—Stephens\r\nsays “copies,” the originals being confiscated—were taken to Europe.\r\nWaldeck announced his book in Paris, and the public had already had a\r\ntaste of his not very sober views in some communications which he had\r\nsent in Aug. and Nov., 1832, to the Société de Géographie de Paris.\r\nLong years of delay followed, and Waldeck had lived to be over ninety,\r\nwhen the French government bought his collection[1057] (in 1860), and\r\nmade preparations for its publication. Out of the 188 drawings thus\r\nsecured, 56 were selected and were admirably engraved, and only that\r\nportion of Waldeck’s text was preserved which was purely descriptive,\r\nand not all of that. Selection was made of Brasseur de Bourbourg,\r\nwho at that time had never visited the ruins,[1058] to furnish\r\nsome introductory matter. This he prepared in an _Avant-propos_,\r\nrecapitulating the progress of such studies; and this was followed\r\nby an _Introduction aux Ruines de Palenqué_, narrating the course of\r\nexplorations up to that time; a section also published separately\r\nas _Recherches sur les Ruines de Palenqué et sur les origines de\r\nla civilisation du Méxique_ (Paris, 1886), and finally Waldeck’s\r\nown _Description des Ruines_, followed by the plates, most of which\r\nrelate to Palenqué. Thus composed, a large volume was published under\r\nthe general title of _Monuments anciens du Méxique_. _Palenqué et\r\nautres ruines de l’ancienne civilisation du Méxique. Collection de\r\nvues [etc.], cartes et plans dessinés d’après nature et relevés par\r\nM. de Waldeck. Texte rédigé par M. Brasseur de Bourbourg._ (Paris,\r\n1864-1866.)[1059] While Waldeck’s results were still unpublished the\r\nruins of Palenqué were brought most effectively to the attention of the\r\nEnglish reader in the _Travels in Central America_ (vol. ii. ch. 17) of\r\nStephens, which was illustrated by the drawings of Catherwood,[1060]\r\nsince famous. These better cover the field, and are more exact than\r\nthose of Dupaix.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF COPAN (RUINS AND VILLAGE).\r\n\r\nFrom _The Stone Sculptures of Copán and Quiriguá_ (N. Y., 1883) of Meye\r\nand Schmidt.]\r\n\r\nBancroft refers to an anonymous account in the _Registro Yucateco_ (i.\r\n318). One of the most intelligent of the later travellers is Arthur\r\nMorelet, who privately printed his _Voyage dans l’Amérique Central,\r\nCuba et le Yucatan_, which includes an account of a fortnight’s stay\r\nat Palenqué. His results would be difficult of access except that\r\nMrs. M. F. Squier, with an introduction by E. G. Squier, published a\r\ntranslation of that part of it relating to the main land as _Travels\r\nin Central America, including accounts of regions unexplored since the\r\nConquest_ (N. Y., 1871).[1061]\r\n\r\nDésiré Charnay was the first to bring photography to the aid of the\r\nstudent when he visited Palenqué in 1858, and his plates forming the\r\nfolio atlas accompanying his _Cités et Ruines Américaines_ (1863), pp.\r\n72, 411, are, as Bancroft (iv. 293) points out, of interest to enable\r\nus to test the drawings of preceding delineators, and to show how time\r\nhad acted on the ruins since the visit of Stephens. His later results\r\nare recorded in his _Les anciennes villes du Nouveau Monde_ (Paris,\r\n1885).[1062]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YUCATAN TYPES.\r\n\r\nGiven by Rosny, _Doc. Écrits de la Antiq.

America_, i. 139;\r\nBancroft, iv. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF THE RUINS OF QUIRIGUA.\r\n\r\nFrom Meye and Schmidt’s _Stone Sculptures of Copán and Quiriguá_ (N.\r\nY., 1883).]\r\n\r\nThere have been only two statues found at Palenqué, in connection\r\nwith the T emple of the Cross,[1063] but the considerable number of\r\ncarved figures discovered at Copan,[1064] as well as the general\r\nimpression that these latter ruins are the oldest on the American\r\ncontinent,[1065] have made in some respects these most celebrated of\r\nthe Honduras remains more interesting than those of Chiapas. It is now\r\ngenerally agreed that the ruins of Copan[1066] do not represent the\r\ntown called Copan, assaulted and captured by Hernando de Choves in\r\n1530, though the identity of names has induced some writers to claim\r\nthat these ruins were inhabited when the Spaniards came.[1067] The\r\nearliest account of them which we have is that in Palacio’s letter\r\nto Felipe II., written (1576) hardly more than a generation after\r\nthe Conquest, and showing that the ruins then were much in the same\r\ncondition as later described.[1068] The next account is that of Fuentes\r\ny Guzman’s _Historia de Guatemala_ (1689), now accessible in the Madrid\r\nedition of 1882; but for a long time only known in the citation in\r\nJuarros’ _Guatemala_ (p. 56), and through those who had copied from\r\nJuarros.[1069] His account is brief, speaks of Castilian costumes,\r\nand is otherwise so enigmatical that Brasseur calls it mendacious.\r\nColonel Galindo, in visiting the ruins in 1836, confounded them with\r\nthe Copan of the Conquest.[1070] The ruins also came Under the scrutiny\r\nof Stephens in 1839, and they were described by him, and drawn by\r\nCatherwood, for the first time with any fullness and care, in their\r\nrespective works.[1071]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlways associated with Copan, and perhaps even older, if the lower\r\nrelief of the carvings can bear that interpretation, are the ruins\r\nnear the village of Quiriguá, in Guatemala, and known by that name.\r\nCatherwood first brought them into notice;[1072] but the visit of\r\nKarl Scherzer in 1854 produced the most extensive account of them\r\nwhich we have, in his _Ein Besuch bei den Ruinen von Quiriguá_ (Wien,\r\n1855).[1073]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe principal explorers of Nicaragua have been Ephraim George Squier,\r\nin his _Nicaragua_,[1074] and Frederick Boyle, in his _Ride across\r\na Continent_ (Lond. 1868),[1075] and their results, as well as the\r\nscattered data of others,[1076] are best epitomized in Bancroft\r\n(iv. ch. 2), who gives other references to second-hand descriptions\r\n(p. 29). Since Bancroft’s survey there have been a few important\r\ncontributions.[1077]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON THE PICTURE-WRITING OF THE NAHUAS AND\r\nMAYAS.\r\n\r\nIN considering the methods of record and communication used by these\r\npeoples, we must keep in mind the two distinct systems of the Aztecs\r\nand the Mayas;[1078] and further, particularly as regards the former,\r\nwe must not forget that some of these writings were made after the\r\nConquest, and were influenced in some degree by Spanish associations.\r\nOf this last class were land titles and catechisms, for the native\r\nsystem obtained for some time as a useful method with the conquerors\r\nfor recording the transmission of lands and helping the instruction by\r\nthe priests.[1079]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAC-SIMILE OF A PART OF LANDA’S MS.\r\n\r\nAfter a fac-simile in the _Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France, nouv.\r\nser._, ii. 34. (Cf. pl. xix. of Rosny’s _Essai sur le déchiffrement_,\r\netc.) It is a copy, not the original, of Landa’s text, but a nearly\r\ncontemporary one (made thirty years after Landa’s death), and the only\r\none known.]\r\n\r\nIt is usual in tracing the development of a hieroglyphic system to\r\nadvance from a purely figurative one—in which pictures of objects are\r\nused—through a symbolic phase; in which such pictures are interpreted\r\nconventionally instead of realistically. It was to this last stage\r\nthat the Aztecs had advanced; but they mingled the two methods, and\r\napparently varied in the order of reading, whether by lines or columns,\r\nforwards, upwards, or backwards. The difficulty of understanding them\r\nis further increased by the same object holding different meanings\r\nin different connections, and still more by the personal element, or\r\nwriter’s style, as we should call it, which was impressed on his choice\r\nof objects and emblems.[1080] This rendered interpretation by no means\r\neasy to the aborigines themselves, and we have statements that when\r\nnative documents were referred to them it required sometimes long\r\nconsultations to reach a common understanding.[1081] The additional\r\nstep by which objects stand for sounds, the Aztecs seem not to have\r\ntaken, except in the names of persons and places, in which they\r\nunderstood the modern child’s art of the rebus, where such symbol\r\nmore or less clearly stands for a syllable, and the representation\r\nwas usually of conventionalized forms, somewhat like the art of the\r\nEuropean herald. Thus the Aztec system was what Daniel Wilson[1082]\r\ncalls “the pictorial suggestion of associated ideas.”[1083] The\r\nphonetic scale, if not comprehended in the Aztec system, made an\r\nessential part of the Maya hieroglyphics, and this was the great\r\ndistinctive feature of the latter, as we learn from the early\r\ndescriptions,[1084] and from the alphabet which Landa has preserved\r\nfor us. It is not only in the codices or books of the Mayas that their\r\nwriting is preserved to us, but in the inscriptions of their carved\r\narchitectural remains.[1085]\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\nNOTE—This representation of Yucatan hieroglyphics is a reduction of\r\npl. i. in Léon de Rosny’s _Essai sur le déchiffrement de l’écriture\r\nhiératique de l’Amérique Centrale_, Paris, 1876. Cf. Bancroft, iv. 92;\r\nShort, 405.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg found, in 1863, in the library\r\nof the Royal Academy of History at Madrid, the MS. of Landa’s\r\n_Relacion_, and discovered in it what purported to be a key to the\r\nMaya alphabet, there were hopes that the interpretation of the\r\nMaya books and inscriptions was not far off. Twenty-five years,\r\nhowever, has not seen the progress that was wished for; and if we\r\nmay believe Valentini, the alphabet of Landa is a pure fabrication\r\nof the bishop himself;[1086] and even some of those who account it\r\ngenuine, like Le Plongeon, hold that it is inadequate in dealing\r\nwith the older Maya inscriptions.[1087] Cyrus Thomas speaks of this\r\nalphabet as simply an attempt of the bishop to pick out of compound\r\ncharacters their simple elements on the supposition that something\r\nlike phonetic representations would be the result.[1088] Landa’s own\r\ndescription[1089] of the alphabet accompanying his graphic key[1090] is\r\nvery unsatisfactory, not to say incomprehensible. Brasseur has tried\r\nto render it in French, and Bancroft in English; but it remains a\r\ndifficult problem to interpret it intelligibly.\r\n\r\nBrasseur very soon set himself the task of interpreting the Troano\r\nmanuscript by the aid of this key, and he soon had the opportunity\r\nof giving his interpretation to the public when the Emperor Napoleon\r\nIII. ordered that codex to be printed in the sumptuous manner of the\r\nimperial press.[1091] The efforts of Brasseur met with hardly a sign of\r\napproval. Léon de Rosny criticised him,[1092] and Dr. Brinton found in\r\nhis results nothing to commend.[1093]\r\n\r\nNo one has approached the question of interpreting these Maya writings\r\nwith more careful scrutiny than Léon de Rosny, who first attracted\r\nattention with his comparative study, _Les écritures figuratives et\r\nhiéroglyphiques des différens peuples anciens et moderns_ (Paris,\r\n1860; again, 1870, augmentée). From 1869 to 1871 he published at\r\nParis four parts of _Archives paléographiques de l’Orient et de\r\nl’Amérique, publiées avec des notices historiques et philologiques_,\r\nin which he included several studies of the native writings, and gave\r\na bibliography (pp. 101-115) of American paleography up to that time.\r\nHis _L’interprétation des anciens textes Mayas_ made part of the first\r\nvolume of the _Archives de la Soc. Américaine de France_ (new series).\r\nHis chief work, making the second volume of the same, is his _Essai\r\nsur le déchiffrement de l’écriture hiératique de l’Amérique Central_\r\n(Paris, 1876), and it is the most thorough examination of the problem\r\nyet made.[1094] The last part (4th) was published in 1878, and a\r\nSpanish translation appeared in 1881.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALENQUÉ HIEROGLYPHICS.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_, ii. p. 63. It is also given\r\nin Bancroft (iv. 355), and others. It is from the Tablet of the Cross.]\r\n\r\nWm. Bollaert, who had paid some attention to the paleography of\r\nAmerica,[1095] was one of the earliest in England to examine Brasseur’s\r\nwork on Landa, which he did in a memoir read before the Anthropological\r\nSociety,[1096] and later in an “Examination of the Central American\r\nhieroglyphs by the recently discovered Maya alphabet.”[1097]\r\nBrinton[1098] calls his conclusions fanciful, and Le Plongeon claims\r\nthat the inscription in Stephens, which Bollaert worked upon, is\r\ninaccurately given, and that Bollaert’s results were nonsense.[1099]\r\nHyacinthe de Charency’s efforts have hardly been more successful,\r\nthough he attempted the use of Landa’s alphabet with something like\r\nscientific care. He examined a small part of the inscription of the\r\nPalenqué tablet of the Cross in his _Essai de déchiffrement d’un\r\nfragment d’inscription palenquéene_.[1100]\r\n\r\nDr. Brinton translated Charency’s results, and, adding Landa’s\r\nalphabet, published his _Ancient phonetic alphabet of Yucatan_ (N. Y.,\r\n1870), a small tract.[1101] His continued studies were manifest in the\r\nintroduction on “The graphic system and the ancient records of the\r\nMayas” to Cyrus Thomas’s _Manuscript Troano_.[1102] In this paper Dr.\r\nBrinton traces the history of the attempts which have thus far been\r\nmade in solving this perplexing problem.[1103] The latest application\r\nof the scientific spirit is that of the astronomer E. S. Holden, who\r\nsought to eliminate the probabilities of recurrent signs by the usual\r\nmathematical methods of resolving systems of modern cipher.[1104]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are few examples of the aboriginal ideographic writings left\r\nto us. Their fewness is usually charged to the destruction which was\r\npublicly made of them under the domination of the Church in the years\r\nfollowing the Conquest.[1105] The alleged agents in this demolition\r\nwere Bishop Landa, in 1562, at Mani, in Yucatan,[1106] and Bishop\r\nZumárraga at Tlatelalco, or, as some say, at Tezcuco, in Mexico.[1107]\r\nPeter Martyr[1108] has told us something of the records as he saw\r\nthem, and we know also from him, and from their subsequent discovery\r\nin European collections, that some examples of them were early taken\r\nto the Old World. We have further knowledge of them from Las Casas\r\nand from Landa himself.[1109] There have been efforts made of late\r\nyears by Icazbalceta and Canon Carrillo to mitigate the severity of\r\njudgment, particularly as respects Zumárraga.[1110] The first, and\r\nindeed the only attempt that has been made to bring together for mutual\r\nillustration all that was known of these manuscripts which escaped\r\nthe fire,[1111] was in the great work of the Viscount Kingsborough\r\n(b. 1795, d. 1837). It was while, as Edward King, he was a student\r\nat Oxford that this nobleman’s passion for Mexican antiquities was\r\nfirst roused by seeing an original Aztec pictograph, described by\r\nPurchas (_Pilgrimes_, vol. iii.), and preserved in the Bodleian. In the\r\nstudies to which this led he was assisted by some special scholars,\r\nincluding Obadiah Rich, who searched for him in Spain in 1830 and\r\n1832, and who after Kingsborough’s death obtained a large part of the\r\nmanuscript collections which that nobleman had amassed (_Catalogue of\r\nthe Sale_, Dublin, 1842). Many of the Kingsborough manuscripts passed\r\ninto the collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps (_Catalogue_, no. 404),\r\nbut the correspondence pertaining to Kingsborough’s life-work seems\r\nto have disappeared. Phillipps had been one of the main encouragers\r\nof Kingsborough in his undertaking.[1112] Kingsborough, who had spent\r\n£30,000 on his undertaking, had a business dispute with the merchants\r\nwho furnished the printing-paper, and he was by them thrown into jail\r\nas a debtor, and died in confinement.[1113]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LÉON DE ROSNY.\r\n\r\nAfter a photogravure in _Les Documents écrits de l’antiquité\r\nAméricaine_ (Paris, 1882). Cf. cut in _Mém. de la Soc. d’Ethnographie_\r\n(1887), xiii. p. 71.]\r\n\r\nKingsborough’s great work, the most sumptuous yet bestowed upon\r\nMexican archæology, was published between 1830 and 1848, there being\r\nan interval of seventeen years between the seventh and eighth volumes.\r\nThe original intention seems to have embraced ten volumes, for the\r\nfinal section of the ninth volume is signatured as for a tenth.[1114]\r\nThe work is called: _Antiquities of Mexico; comprising facsimiles of\r\nAncient Mexican Paintings and Hieroglyphics, preserved in the Royal\r\nLibraries of Paris, Berlin, and Dresden; in the Imperial Library of\r\nVienna; in the Vatican Library; in the Borgian Museum at Rome; in\r\nthe Library of the Institute of Bologna; and in the Bodleian Library\r\nat Oxford; together with the Monuments of New Spain, by M. Dupaix;\r\nillustrated by many valuable inedited MSS_. With the theory maintained\r\nby Kingsborough throughout the work, that the Jews were the first\r\ncolonizers of the country, we have nothing to do here; but as the\r\nearliest and as yet the largest repository of hieroglyphic material,\r\nthe book needs to be examined. The compiler states where he found his\r\nMSS., but he gives nothing of their history, though something more\r\nis now known of their descent. Peter Martyr speaks of the number of\r\nMexican MSS. which had in his day been taken to Spain, and Prescott\r\nremarks it as strange that not a single one given by Kingsborough\r\nwas found in that country. There are, however, some to be seen there\r\nnow.[1115] Comparisons which have been made of Kingsborough’s plates\r\nshow that they are not inexact; but they almost necessarily lack the\r\nvalidity that the modern photographic processes give to facsimiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FAC-SIMILE OF PLATE XXV OF THE DRESDEN CODEX.\r\n\r\nFrom Cyrus Thomas’s _Manuscript Troano_.]\r\n\r\nKingsborough’s first volume opens with a fac-simile of what is\r\nusually called the _Codex Mendoza_, preserved in the Bodleian. It is,\r\nhowever, a contemporary copy on European paper of an original now lost,\r\nwhich was sent by the Viceroy Mendoza to Charles V. Another copy made\r\npart of the Boturini collection, and from this Lorenzana[1116] engraved\r\nthat portion of it which consists of tribute-rolls. The story told\r\nof the fate of the original is, that on its passage to Europe it was\r\ncaptured by a French cruiser and taken to Paris, where it was bought\r\nby the chaplain of the English embassy, the antiquary Purchas, who\r\nhas engraved it.[1117] It was then lost sight of, and if Prescott’s\r\ninference is correct it was not the original, but the Bodleian copy,\r\nwhich came into Purchas’ hands.[1118]\r\n\r\nBeside the tribute-rolls,[1119] which make one part of it, the MS.\r\ncovers the civil history of the Mexicans, with a third part on the\r\ndiscipline and economy of the people, which renders it of so much\r\nimportance in an archæological sense.[1120] The second reproduction\r\nin Kingsborough’s first volume is what he calls the _Codex\r\nTelleriano-Remensis_, preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris,\r\nand formerly owned by M. Le Tellier.[1121] The rest of this initial\r\nvolume is made up of facsimiles of Mexican hieroglyphics and paintings,\r\nfrom the Boturini and Selden collections, which last is in the Bodleian.\r\n\r\nThe second Kingsborough volume opens with a reproduction of the _Codex\r\nVaticanus_ (the explanation[1122] is in volume vi.), which is in the\r\nlibrary of the Vatican, and it is known to have been copied in Mexico\r\nby Pedro de los Rios in 1566. It is partly historical and partly\r\nmythological.[1123] The rest of this volume is made up of facsimiles of\r\nother manuscripts,—one given to the Bodleian by Archbishop Laud, others\r\nat Bologna,[1124] Vienna,[1125] and Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe third volume reproduces one belonging to the Borgian Museum at\r\nRome, written on skin, and thought to be a ritual and astrological\r\nalmanac. This is accompanied by a commentary by Frabega.[1126]\r\nKingsborough gives but a single Maya MS., and this is in his third\r\nvolume, and stands with him as an Aztec production. This is the\r\n_Dresden Codex_, not very exactly rendered, which is preserved in the\r\nroyal library in that city, for which it was bought by Götz,[1127] at\r\nVienna, in 1739. Prescott (i. 107) seemed to recognize its difference\r\nfrom the Aztec MSS., without knowing precisely how to class it.[1128]\r\nBrasseur de Bourbourg calls it a religious and astrological ritual. It\r\nis in two sections, and it is not certain that they belong together.\r\nIn 1880 it was reproduced at Dresden by polychromatic photography\r\n(Chromo-Lichtdruck), as the process is called, under the editing of\r\nDr. E. Förstemann, who in an introduction describes it as composed of\r\nthirty-nine oblong sheets folded together like a fan. They are made of\r\nthe bark of a tree, and covered with varnish. Thirty-five have drawings\r\nand hieroglyphics on both sides; the other four on one side only. It is\r\nnow preserved between glass to prevent handling, and both sides can be\r\nexamined. Some progress has been made, it is professed, in deciphering\r\nits meaning, and it is supposed to contain “records of a mythic,\r\nhistoric, and ritualistic character.”[1129]\r\n\r\nAnother script in Kingsborough, perhaps a Tezcucan MS., though having\r\nsome Maya affinities, is the _Fejérvary Codex_, then preserved in\r\nHungary, and lately owned by Mayer, of Liverpool.[1130]\r\n\r\nThree other Maya manuscripts have been brought to light since\r\nKingsborough’s day, to say nothing of three others said to be in\r\nprivate hands, and not described.[1131] Of these, the _Codex Troano_\r\nhas been the subject of much study. It is the property of a Madrid\r\ngentleman, Don Juan Tro y Ortolano, and the title given to the\r\nmanuscript has been somewhat fantastically formed from his name by the\r\nAbbé Etienne Charles Brasseur de Bourbourg, who was instrumental in its\r\nrecognition about 1865 or 1866, and who edited a sumptuous two-volume\r\nfolio edition with chromo-lithographic plates.[1132]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CODEX CORTESIANUS.\r\n\r\nFrom a fac-simile in the _Archives de la Société Américaine de France,\r\nnouv. ser._, ii. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CODEX PEREZIANUS.\r\n\r\nOne of the leaves of a MS. No. 2, in the Bibliothèque Nationale,\r\nParis, following the fac-simile (pl. 124) in Léon de Rosny’s _Archives\r\npaléographiques_ (Paris, 1869).]\r\n\r\nWhile Léon de Rosny was preparing his _Essai sur le déchiffrement\r\nde l’Ecriture hiératique_ (1876), a Maya manuscript was offered to\r\nthe Bibliothèque Impériale in Paris and declined, because the price\r\ndemanded was too high. Photographic copies of two of its leaves had\r\nbeen submitted, and one of these is given by Rosny in the _Essai_ (pl.\r\nxi.). The Spanish government finally bought the MS., which, because\r\nit was supposed to have once belonged to Cortes, is now known as the\r\n_Codex Cortesianus_. Rosny afterwards saw it and studied it in the\r\nMuseo Archeológico at Madrid, as he makes known in his _Doc. Ecrits\r\nde la Antiq. Amér._, p. 79, where he points out the complementary\r\ncharacter of one of its leaves with another of the MS. Troano, showing\r\nthem to belong together, and gives photographs of the two (pl. v. vi.),\r\nas well as of other leaves (pl. 8 and 9). The part of this codex of a\r\ncalendar character (Tableau des Bacab) is reproduced from Rosny’s plate\r\nby Cyrus Thomas[1133] in an essay in the _Third Report of the Bureau of\r\nEthnology_, together with an attempted restoration of the plate, which\r\nis obscure in parts. Finally a small edition (85 copies) of the entire\r\nMS. was published at Paris in 1883.[1134]\r\n\r\nThe last of the Maya MSS. recently brought to light is sometimes cited\r\nas the _Codex Perezianus_, because the paper in which it was wrapped,\r\nwhen recognized in 1859 by Rosny,[1135] bore the name “Perez”; and\r\nsometimes designated as Codex Mexicanus, or Manuscrit Yucatèque No. 2,\r\nof the National Library at Paris. It was a few years later published\r\nas _Manuscrit dit Méxicain No. 2 de la Bibliothèque Impériale,\r\nphotographié par ordre de S. E. M. Duruy, ministre de l’instruction\r\npublique_ (Paris, 1864, in folio, 50 copies). The original is a\r\nfragment of eleven leaves, and Brasseur[1136] speaks of it as the most\r\nbeautiful of all the MSS. in execution, but the one which has suffered\r\nthe most from time and usage.[1137]\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\nNOTE.—This Yucatan bas-relief follows a photograph by Rosny (1880),\r\nreproduced in the _Mém. de la Soc. d’Ethnographie_, no. 3 (Paris,\r\n1882).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE INCA CIVILIZATION IN PERU.\r\n\r\nBY CLEMENTS R. MARKHAM, C. B.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE civilization of the Incas of Peru is the most important, because it\r\nis the highest, phase in the development of progress among the American\r\nraces. It represents the combined efforts, during long periods, of\r\nseveral peoples who eventually became welded into one nation. The\r\nespecial interest attaching to the study of this civilization consists\r\nin the fact that it was self-developed, and that, so far as can be\r\nascertained, it received no aid and no impulse from foreign contact.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, however, to bear in mind that the empire of the Incas,\r\nin its final development, was formed of several nations which had,\r\nduring long periods, worked out their destinies apart from each other;\r\nand that one, at least, appears to have been entirely distinct from\r\nthe Incas in race and language.[1138] These facts must be carefully\r\nborne in mind in pursuing inquiries relating to the history of Inca\r\ncivilization. It is also essential that the nature and value of the\r\nevidence on which conclusions must be based should be understood and\r\ncarefully weighed. This evidence is of several kinds. Besides the\r\ntestimony of Spanish writers who witnessed the conquest of Peru, or\r\nwho lived a generation afterwards, there is the evidence derived from\r\na study of the characteristics of descendants of the Inca people, of\r\ntheir languages and literature, and of their architectural and other\r\nremains. These various kinds of evidence must be compared, their\r\nrespective values must be considered, and thus alone, in our time, can\r\nthe nearest approximation to the truth be reached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP IN BRASSEUR’S POPUL VUH.]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of writers in the sixteenth century, who had the\r\nadvantage of being able to see the workings of Inca institutions, to\r\nexamine the outcome of their civilization in all its branches, and\r\nto converse with the Incas themselves respecting the history and the\r\ntraditions of their people, is the most important evidence. Much of\r\nthis testimony has been preserved, but unfortunately a great deal is\r\nlost. The sack of Cadiz by the Earl of Essex, in 1595, was the occasion\r\nof the loss of Blas Valera’s priceless work.[1139] Other valuable\r\nwritings have been left in manuscript, and have been mislaid through\r\nneglect and carelessness. Authors are mentioned, or even quoted, whose\r\nbooks have disappeared. The contemplation of the fallen Inca empire\r\nexcited the curiosity and interest of a great number of intelligent men\r\namong the Spanish conquerors. Many wrote narratives of what they saw\r\nand heard. A few studied the language and traditions of the people with\r\nclose attention. And these authors were not confined to the clerical\r\nand legal professions; they included several of the soldier-conquerors\r\nthemselves.[1140]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY SPANISH MAP OF PERU.\r\n\r\n[From the Paris (1774) edition of Zarate. The development of Peruvian\r\ncartography under the Spanish explorations is traced in a note in Vol.\r\nII. p. 509; but the best map for the student is a map of the empire of\r\nthe Incas, showing all except the provinces of Quito and Chili, with\r\nthe routes of the successive Inca conquerors marked on it, given in the\r\n_Journal of the Roy. Geog. Soc._ (1872), vol. xlii. p. 513, compiled by\r\nMr. Trelawny Saunders to illustrate Mr. Markham’s paper of the previous\r\nyear, on the empire of the Incas. The map was republished by the\r\nHakluyt Society in 1880. The map of Wiener in his _Pérou et Bolivie_ is\r\nalso a good one. Cf. Squier’s map in his _Peru_.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the country and climate was a potent agent in forming\r\nthe character of the people, and in enabling them to make advances in\r\ncivilization. In the dense forests of the Amazonian valleys, in the\r\nboundless prairies and savannas, we only meet with wandering tribes\r\nof hunters and fishers. It is on the lofty plateaux of the Andes,\r\nwhere extensive tracts of land are adapted for tillage, or in the\r\ncomparatively temperate valleys of the western coast, that we find\r\nnations advanced in civilization.[1141]\r\n\r\nThe region comprised in the empire of the Incas during its greatest\r\nextension is bounded on the east by the forest-covered Amazonian\r\nplains, on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and its length along the\r\nline of the Cordilleras was upwards of 1,500 miles, from 2° N. to 20°\r\nS. This vast tract comprises every temperature and every variety of\r\nphysical feature. The inhabitants of the plains and valleys of the\r\nAndes enjoyed a temperate and generally bracing climate, and their\r\nenergies were called forth by the physical difficulties which had to be\r\novercome through their skill and hardihood. Such a region was suited\r\nfor the gradual development of a vigorous race, capable of reaching\r\nto a high state of culture. The different valleys and plateaux are\r\nseparated by lofty mountain chains or by profound gorges, so that the\r\ninhabitants would, in the earliest period of their history, make their\r\nown slow progress in comparative isolation, and would have little\r\nintercommunication. When at last they were brought together as one\r\npeople, and thus combined their efforts in forming one system, it is\r\nlikely that such a union would have a tendency to be of long duration,\r\nowing to the great difficulties which must have been overcome in its\r\ncreation. On the other hand, if, in course of time, disintegration once\r\nbegan, it might last long, and great efforts would be required to build\r\nup another united empire. The evidence seems to point to the recurrence\r\nof these processes more than once, in the course of ages, and to their\r\ncommencement in a very remote antiquity.\r\n\r\nOne strong piece of evidence pointing to the great length of time\r\nduring which the Inca nations had been a settled and partially\r\ncivilized race, is to be found in the plants that had been brought\r\nunder cultivation, and in the animals that had been domesticated. Maize\r\nis unknown in a wild state,[1142] and many centuries must have elapsed\r\nbefore the Peruvians could have produced numerous cultivated varieties,\r\nand have brought the plant to such a high state of perfection. The\r\npeculiar edible roots, called _oca_ and _aracacha_, also exist only\r\nas cultivated plants. There is no wild variety of the _chirimoya_,\r\nand the Peruvian species of the cotton plant is known only under\r\ncultivation.[1143] The potato is found wild in Chile, and probably\r\nin Peru, as a very insignificant tuber. But the Peruvians, after\r\ncultivating it for centuries, increased its size and produced a great\r\nnumber of edible varieties.[1144] Another proof of the great antiquity\r\nof Peruvian civilization is to be found in the llama and alpaca, which\r\nare domesticated animals, with individuals varying in color: the one\r\na beast of burden yielding coarse wool, and the other bearing a thick\r\nfleece of the softest silken fibres. Their prototypes are the wild\r\nhuanaco and vicuña, of uniform color, and untameable. Many centuries\r\nmust have elapsed before the wild creatures of the Andean solitudes,\r\nwith the habits of chamois, could have been converted into the Peruvian\r\nsheep which cannot exist apart from men.[1145]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LLAMAS.\r\n\r\n[One of the cuts which did service in the Antwerp edition of Cieza de\r\nLeon. Cf. Bollaert on the llama, alpaca, huanaco, and vicuña species in\r\nthe _Sporting Review_, Feb., 1863; the cuts in Squier, pp. 246, 250;\r\nDr. Van Tschudi, in the _Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_, 1885.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThese considerations point to so vast a period during which the\r\nexisting race had dwelt in the Peruvian Andes, that any speculation\r\nrespecting its origin would necessarily be futile in the present state\r\nof our knowledge.[1146] The weight of tradition indicates the south as\r\nthe quarter whence the people came whose descendants built the edifices\r\nat Tiahuanacu.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient remains of a primitive people in the Peruvian Andes\r\nconsist of rude _cromlechs_, or burial-places, which are met with in\r\nvarious localities. Don Modesto Basadre has described some by the\r\nroadside, in the descent from Umabamba to Charasani, in Bolivia. These\r\ncromlechs are formed of four great slabs of slate, each slab being\r\nabout five feet high, four or five in width, and more than an inch\r\nthick. The four slabs are perfectly shaped and worked so as to fit into\r\neach other at the corners. A fifth slab is placed over them, and over\r\nthe whole a pyramid of clay and rough stones is piled. These cromlechs\r\nare the early memorials of a race which was succeeded by the people who\r\nconstructed the cyclopean edifices of the Andean plateaux.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DETAILS AT TIAHUANACU.\r\n\r\nKEY:—\r\nA, Lid or cover of some aperture, of stone, with two handles neatly\r\nundercut.\r\nB, A window of trachyte, of careful workmanship, in one piece.\r\nC, Block of masonry with carving.\r\nD, E, Two views of a corner-piece to some stone conduit, carefully\r\nornamented with projecting lines.\r\nF, G, H, I, Other pieces of cut masonry lying about. ]\r\n\r\nFor there is reason to believe that a powerful empire had existed\r\nin Peru centuries before the rise of the Inca dynasty. Cyclopean\r\nruins, quite foreign to the genius of Inca architecture, point to this\r\nconclusion. The wide area over which they are found is an indication\r\nthat the government which caused them to be built ruled over an\r\nextensive empire, while their cyclopean character is a proof that their\r\nprojectors had an almost unlimited supply of labor. Religious myths\r\nand dynastic traditions throw some doubtful light on that remote past,\r\nwhich has left its silent memorials in the huge stones of Tiahuanacu,\r\nSacsahuaman, and Ollantay, and in the altar of Concacha.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARVINGS AT TIAHUANACU.\r\n\r\nKEY:—\r\nA, Portion of the ornament which runs along the base of the rows of\r\nfigures on the monolithic doorway.\r\nB, Prostrate idol lying on its face near the ruins; about 9 feet long.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAS-RELIEFS AT TIAHUANACU.\r\n\r\nKEY:—\r\nA, A winged human figure with the crowned head of a condor, from the\r\ncentral row on the monolithic doorway.\r\nB, A winged human figure with human head crowned, from the upper row on\r\nthe monolithic doorway.\r\n\r\n[There are well-executed cuts of these sculptures in Ruge’s _Geschichte\r\ndes Zeitalters der Entdeckungen_, pp. 430, 431.

They are 12,930 feet above the level of the sea, and 130\r\nabove that of the lake, which is about twelve miles off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRAGMENTS AT TIAHUANACU.\r\n\r\nVarious curiously carved stones found scattered about the ruins.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REVERSE OF THE DOORWAY AT TIAHUANACU.\r\n\r\n[Cf. view in Squier’s _Peru_, p. 289, with other particulars of the\r\nruins, p. 276, etc.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThey consist of a quadrangular space, entered by the famous monolithic\r\ndoorway, and surrounded by large stones standing on end; and of a hill\r\nor mound encircled by remains of a wall, consisting of enormous blocks\r\nof stone. The whole covers an area about 400 yards long by 350 broad.\r\nThere is a lesser temple, about a quarter of a mile distant, containing\r\nstones 36 feet long by 7, and 26 by 16, with recesses in them which\r\nhave been compared to seats of judgment. The weight of the two great\r\nstones has been estimated at from 140 to 200 tons each, and the\r\ndistance of the quarries whence they could have been brought is from 15\r\nto 40 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMAGE AT TIAHUANACU.\r\n\r\n[This is an enlarged drawing of the bas-relief shown in the picture of\r\nthe broken doorway (p. 218).

The outer side is ornamented by accurately cut niches\r\nand rectangular mouldings. The whole of the inner side, from a line\r\nlevel with the upper lintel of the doorway to the top, is a mass of\r\nsculpture, which speaks to us, in difficult riddles, alas! of the\r\ncustoms and art-culture, of the beliefs and traditions, of an ancient\r\nand lost civilization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROKEN MONOLITH DOORWAY AT TIAHUANACU.\r\n\r\n[An enlarged drawing of the image over the arch is given in another\r\ncut.

Squier’s _Peru_, p. 288.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nIn the centre there is a figure carved in high relief, in an oblong\r\ncompartment, 2 ft. 2 in. long by 1 ft. 6 in.[1148] Squier describes\r\nthis figure as angularly but boldly cut. The head is surrounded by\r\nrays, each terminating in a circle or the head of an animal. The breast\r\nis adorned with two serpents united by a square band. Another band,\r\ndivided into ornamented compartments, passes round the neck, and the\r\nends are brought down to the girdle, from which hang six human heads.\r\nHuman heads also hang from the elbows, and the hands clasp sceptres\r\nwhich terminate in the heads of condors. The legs are cut off near the\r\ngirdle, and below there are a series of frieze-like ornaments, each\r\nending with a condor’s head. On either side of this central sculpture\r\nthere are three tiers of figures, 16 in each tier, or 48 in all, each\r\nin a kneeling posture, and facing towards the large central figure.\r\nEach figure is in a square, the sides of which measure eight inches.\r\nAll are winged, and hold sceptres ending in condors’ heads; but while\r\nthose in the upper and lower tiers have crowned human heads, those in\r\nthe central tier have the heads of condors. There is a profusion of\r\nornament on all these figures, consisting of heads of birds and fishes.\r\nAn ornamental frieze runs along the base of the lowest tier of figures,\r\nconsisting of an elaborate pattern of angular lines ending in condors’\r\nheads, with larger human heads surrounded by rays, in the intervals of\r\nthe pattern. Cieza de Leon and Alcobasa[1149] mention that, besides\r\nthis sculpture over the doorway, there were richly carved statues at\r\nTiahuanacu, which have since been destroyed, and many cylindrical\r\npillars with capitals. The head of one statue, with a peculiar\r\nhead-dress, which is 3 ft. 6 in. long, still lies by the roadside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIAHUANACU RESTORED.\r\n\r\nAfter a drawing given in _The Temple of the Andes_ by Richard Inwards\r\n(London, 1884).]\r\n\r\nThe masonry of the ruins is admirably worked, according to the\r\ntestimony of all visitors. Squier says: “The stone itself is a dark and\r\nexceedingly hard trachyte. It is faced with a precision that no skill\r\ncan excel. Its lines are perfectly drawn, and its right angles turned\r\nwith an accuracy that the most careful geometer could not surpass. I do\r\nnot believe there exists a better piece of stone-cutting, the material\r\nconsidered, on this or the other continent.”\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to describe these ruins, and especially the sculpture\r\nover the monolithic doorway, with some minuteness, because, with the\r\nprobable exception of the cromlechs, they are the most ancient, and,\r\nwithout any exception, the most interesting that have been met with in\r\nPeru. There is nothing elsewhere that at all resembles the sculpture on\r\nthe monolithic doorway at Tiahuanacu.[1150] The central figure, with\r\nrows of kneeling worshippers on either side, all covered with symbolic\r\ndesigns, represents, it may be conjectured, either the sovereign and\r\nhis vassals, or, more probably, the Deity, with representatives of all\r\nthe nations bowing down before him. The sculpture and the most ancient\r\ntraditions should throw light upon each other.\r\n\r\nFurther north there are other examples of prehistoric cyclopean\r\nremains. Such is the great wall, with its “stone of 12 corners,”\r\nin the Calle del Triunfo at Cuzco. Such is the famous fortress of\r\nCuzco, on the Sacsahuaman Hill. Such, too, are portions of the ruins\r\nat Ollantay-tampu. Still farther north there are cyclopean ruins at\r\nConcacha, at Huiñaque, and at Huaraz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF SACSAHUAMAN.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in Ruge’s _Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen_.\r\nMarkham has elsewhere described these ruins,—_Cieza de Leon_, 259, 324;\r\n2d part, 160; _Royal Commentaries of the Incas_, ii., with a plan,\r\nreproduced in Vol. II. p. 521, and another plan of Cuzco, showing the\r\nposition of the fortress in its relations to the city. There are plans\r\nand views in Squier’s _Peru_, ch. 23.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nTiahuanacu is interesting because it is possible that the elaborate\r\ncharacter of its symbolic sculpture may throw glimmerings of light on\r\nremote history; but Sacsahuaman, the fortress overlooking the city of\r\nCuzco, is, without comparison, the grandest monument of an ancient\r\ncivilization in the New World. Like the Pyramids and the Coliseum,\r\nit is imperishable. It consists of a fortified work 600 yards in\r\nlength, built of gigantic stones, in three lines, forming walls\r\nsupporting terraces and parapets arranged in salient and retiring\r\nangles. This work defends the only assailable side of a position which\r\nis impregnable, owing to the steepness of the ascent in all other\r\ndirections. The outer wall averages a height of 26 feet. Then there is\r\na terrace 16 yards across, whence the second wall rises to 18 feet.\r\nThe second terrace is six yards across, and the third wall averages a\r\nheight of 12 feet. The total height of the fortification is 56 feet.\r\nThe stones are of blue limestone, of enormous size and irregular in\r\nshape, but fitted into each other with rare precision. One of the\r\nstones is 27 feet high by 14, and stones 15 feet high by 12 are common\r\nthroughout the work.\r\n\r\nAt Ollantay-tampu the ruins are of various styles, but the later works\r\nare raised on ancient cyclopean foundations.[1151] There are six\r\nporphyry slabs 12 feet high by 6 or 7; stone beams 15 and 20 feet long;\r\nstairs and recesses hewn out of the solid rock. Here, as at Tiahuanacu,\r\nthere were, according to Cieza de Leon,[1152] men and animals carved on\r\nthe stones, but they have disappeared. The same style of architecture,\r\nthough only in fragments, is met with further north.\r\n\r\nEast of the river Apurimac, and not far from the town of Abancay, there\r\nare three groups of ancient monuments in a deep valley surrounded by\r\nlofty spurs of the Andes. There is a great cyclopean wall, a series of\r\nseats or thrones of various forms hewn out of the solid stone, and a\r\nhuge block carved on five sides, called the _Rumi-huasi_. The northern\r\nface of this monolith is cut into the form of a staircase; on the east\r\nthere are two enormous seats separated by thick partitions, and on\r\nthe south there is a sort of lookout place, with a seat. Collecting\r\nchannels traverse the block, and join trenches or grooves leading to\r\ntwo deep excavations on the western side. On this western side there\r\nis also a series of steps, apparently for the fall of a cascade of\r\nwater connected with the sacrificial rites. Molina gives a curious\r\naccount of the water sacrifices of the Incas.[1153] The _Rumi-huasi_\r\nseems to have been the centre of a great sanctuary, and to have been\r\nused as an altar. Its surface is carved with animals amidst a labyrinth\r\nof cavities and partition ridges. Its length is 20 feet by 14 broad,\r\nand 12 feet high. Here we have, no doubt, a sacrificial altar of the\r\nancient people, on which the blood of animals and libations of _chicha_\r\nflowed in torrents.[1154]\r\n\r\nSpanish writers received statements from the Indians that one or other\r\nof these cyclopean ruins was built by some particular Inca. Garcilasso\r\nde la Vega even names the architects of the Cuzco fortress. But it is\r\nclear from the evidence of the most careful investigators, such as\r\nCieza de Leon, that there was no real knowledge of their origin, and\r\nthat memory of the builders was either quite lost, or preserved in\r\nvague, uncertain traditions.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient myth points to the region of Lake Titicaca as the\r\nscene of the creative operations of a Deity, or miracle-working\r\nLord.[1155] This Deity is said to have created the sun, moon, and\r\nstars, or to have caused them to rise out of Lake Titicaca. He also\r\ncreated men of stone at Tiahuanacu, or of clay; making them pass\r\nunder the earth, and appear again out of caves, tree-trunks, rocks,\r\nor fountains in the different provinces which were to be peopled by\r\ntheir descendants. But this seems to be a later attempt to reconcile\r\nthe ancient Titicaca myth with the local worship of natural objects\r\nas ancestors or founders of their race, among the numerous subjugated\r\ntribes; as well as to account for the colossal statues of unknown\r\norigin at Tiahuanacu. There are variations of the story, but there is\r\ngeneral concurrence in the main points: that the Deity created the\r\nheavenly bodies and the human race, and that the ancient people, or\r\ntheir rulers, were called _Pirua_. Tradition also seems to point to\r\nregions south of the lake as the quarter whence the first settlers came\r\nwho worked out the earliest civilization.[1156] We may, in accordance\r\nwith all the indications that are left to us, connect the great god\r\n_Illa Ticsi_ with the central figure of the Tiahuanacu sculpture,\r\nand the kneeling worshippers with the rulers of all the nations and\r\ntribes which had been subjugated by the _Hatun-runa_,[1157]—the great\r\nmen who had Pirua for their king, and who originally came from the\r\ndistant south. The Piruas governed a vast empire, erected imperishable\r\ncyclopean edifices, and developed a complicated civilization, which\r\nis dimly indicated to us by the numerous symbolical sculptures on the\r\nmonolith. They also, in a long course of years, brought wild plants\r\nunder cultivation, and domesticated the animals of the lofty Andean\r\nplateau. But it is remarkable that the shores of Lake Titicaca, which\r\nare almost treeless, and where corn will not ripen, should have been\r\nchosen as the centre of this most ancient civilization. Yet the ruins\r\nof Tiahuanacu conclusively establish the fact that the capital of the\r\nPiruas was on the loftiest site ever selected for the seat of a great\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nThe Amautas, or learned men of the later Inca period, preserved the\r\nnames of sovereigns of the Pirua dynasty, commencing with Pirua Manco,\r\nand continuing for sixty-five generations. Lopez conjectures that\r\nthere was a change of dynasty after the eighteenth Pirua king, because\r\nhitherto Montesinos, who has recorded the list, had always called each\r\nsuccessor son and heir, but after the eighteenth only heir. Hence he\r\nthinks that a new dynasty of Amautas, or kings of the learned caste,\r\nsucceeded the Piruas. The only deeds recorded of this long line of\r\nkings are their success in repelling invasions and their alterations of\r\nthe calendar. At length there appears to have been a general disruption\r\nof the empire: Cuzco was nearly deserted, rebel leaders rose up in all\r\ndirections, the various tribes became independent, and the chief who\r\nclaimed to be the representative of the old dynasties was reduced to a\r\nsmall territory to the south of Cuzco, in the valley of the Vilcamayu,\r\nand was called “King of Tampu Tocco.” This state of disintegration is\r\nsaid to have continued for twenty-eight generations, at the end of\r\nwhich time a new empire began to be consolidated under the Incas, which\r\ninherited the civilization and traditions of the ancient dynasties, and\r\nsucceeded to their power and dominion.\r\n\r\nIt was long believed that the lists of kings of the earlier dynasties\r\nrested solely on the authority of Montesinos, and they consequently\r\nreceived little credit. But recent research has brought to light\r\nthe work of another writer, who studied before Montesinos, and who\r\nincidentally refers to two of the sovereigns in his lists.[1158] This\r\nfurnishes independent evidence that the catalogues of early kings had\r\nbeen preserved orally or by means of _quipus_, and that they were in\r\nexistence when the Spaniards conquered Peru; thus giving weight to the\r\ntestimony of Montesinos.\r\n\r\nThe second myth of the Peruvians refers to the origin of the Incas,\r\nwho derived their descent from the kings of Tampu Tocco, and had their\r\noriginal home at Paccari-tampu, in the valley of the Vilcamayu, south\r\nof Cuzco. It is, therefore, an ancestral myth. It is related that\r\nfour brothers, with their four sisters, issued forth from apertures\r\n(_Tocco_) in a cave at Paccari-tampu, a name which means “the abode\r\nof dawn.” The brothers were called Ayar Manco, Ayar Cachi, Ayar Uchu,\r\nand Ayar Sauca, names to which the Incas, in the time of Garcilasso\r\nde la Vega, gave a fanciful meaning.[1159] One of the brothers showed\r\nextraordinary prowess in hurling a stone from a sling. The others\r\nbecame jealous, and, persuading Ayar Auca, the expert slingsman, to\r\nreturn into the cave, they blocked the entrance with rocks. Ayar\r\nUchu was converted into a stone idol, on the summit of a hill near\r\nCuzco, called Huanacauri. Manco then advanced to Cuzco with his\r\nyoungest brother, and found that the place was occupied by a chief\r\nnamed Alcaviza and his people. Here Manco established the seat of his\r\ngovernment, and the Alcaviza tribe appears to have submitted to him,\r\nand to have lived side by side with the Incas for some generations. The\r\nHuanacauri hill was considered the most sacred place in Peru; while\r\nthe _Tampu-tocco_, or cave at Paccari-tampu, was, through the piety of\r\ndescendants, faced with a masonry wall, having three windows lined with\r\nplates of gold.\r\n\r\nThere is a third myth which seems to connect the ancient tradition\r\nof Titicaca with the ancestral myth of the Incas. It is said that\r\nlong after the creation by the Deity, a great and beneficent being\r\nappeared at Tiahuanacu, who divided the world among four kings: Manco\r\nCcapac, Colla, Tocay[1160] or Tocapo,[1161] and Pinahua.[1162] The\r\nnames Tuapaca, Arnauan,[1163] Tonapa,[1164] and Tarapaca occur in\r\nconnection with this being, while some authorities tell us that his\r\nname was unknown. Betanzos says that he went from Titicaca to Cuzco,\r\nwhere he set up a chief named Alcaviza, and that he advanced through\r\nthe country until he disappeared over the sea at Puerto Viejo. It is\r\nalso related that the people of Canas attacked him, but were converted\r\nby a miracle, and that they built a great temple, with an image, at\r\nCacha, in honor of this being, or of his god Illa Ticsi Uira-cocha.\r\nThis temple now forms a ruin which in its structure and arrangement is\r\nunique in Peru, and therefore deserves special attention.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the temple of Cacha are in the valley of the Vilcamayu,\r\nsouth of Cuzco. They were described by Garcilasso de la Vega, and\r\nhave been visited and carefully examined by Squier. The main temple\r\nwas 330 feet long by 87 broad, with wrought-stone walls and a steep\r\npitched roof. A high wall extended longitudinally through the centre\r\nof the structure, consisting of a wrought-stone foundation, 8 feet\r\nhigh and 5½ feet thick on the level of the ground, supporting an adobe\r\nsuperstructure, the whole being 40 feet high. This wall was pierced\r\nby 12 lofty doorways, 14 feet high. But midway there are sockets for\r\nthe reception of beams, showing the existence of a second story, as\r\ndescribed by Garcilasso. Between the transverse and outer walls there\r\nwere two series of pillars, 12 on each side, built like the transverse\r\nwall, with 8 feet of wrought stone, and completed to a height of 22\r\nfeet with adobes. These pillars appear to have supported the second\r\nfloor, where, according to Garcilasso, there was a shrine containing\r\nthe statue of Uira-cocha. At right angles to the temple, Squier\r\ndiscovered the remains of a series of supplemental edifices surrounding\r\ncourts, and built upon a terrace 260 yards long.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities of the temple of Cacha consist in the use of rows\r\nof columns to support a second floor, and in the great height of the\r\nwalls. In these respects it is unique, and if similar edifices ever\r\nexisted, they appear to have been destroyed previous to the rise of\r\nthe Inca empire. The Cacha temple belongs neither to the cyclopean\r\nperiod of the Piruas nor to the Inca style of architecture. Connected\r\nwith the strange myth of the wandering prophet of Viracocha, it stands\r\nby itself, as one of those unsolved problems which await future\r\ninvestigation. The statue in the shrine on the upper story is described\r\nby Cieza de Leon, who saw it.\r\n\r\nBoth the Titicaca and the Cacha myths have, in later times, been\r\nconnected and more or less amalgamated with the ancestral myth of the\r\nIncas. Thus Garcilasso de la Vega makes Manco Ccapac come direct from\r\nTiticaca; while Molina refers to him as one of the beings created\r\nthere, who went down through the earth and came up at Paccari-tampu.\r\nSalcamayhua makes the being Tonapa, of the Cacha myth, arrive at Apu\r\nTampu, or Paccari-tampu, and leave a sacred sceptre there, called\r\n_tupac yauri_, for Manco Ccapac. These are later interpolations, made\r\nwith the object of connecting the family myth of the Incas with more\r\nancient traditions. The wise men of the Inca system, through the care\r\nof Spanish writers of the time of the conquest, have handed down these\r\nthree traditions and the catalogue of kings. The Titicaca myth tells us\r\nof the Deity worshipped by the builders of Tiahuanacu, and the story of\r\nthe creation. The Cacha myth has reference to some great reformer of\r\nvery ancient times. The Paccari-tampu myth records the origin of the\r\nInca dynasty. Although they are overlaid with fables and miraculous\r\noccurrences, the main facts touching the original home of Manco Ccapac\r\nand his march to Cuzco are probably historical.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of kings given by Montesinos, allowing an average of\r\ntwenty years for each, would place the commencement of the Pirua\r\ndynasty in about 470 B.C.; in the days when the Greeks, under Cimon,\r\nwere defeating the Persians, and nearly a century after the death of\r\nSakya Muni in India. This early empire flourished for about 1,200\r\nyears, and the disruption took place in 830 A.D., in the days of King\r\nEgbert. The disintegration continued for 500 years, and the rise of the\r\nIncas under Manco was probably coeval with the days of St. Louis and\r\nHenry III of England.[1165] By that time the country had been broken\r\nup into separate tribes for 500 years, and the work of reunion, so\r\nsplendidly achieved by the Incas, was most arduous. At the same time,\r\nthe ancient civilization of the Piruas was partially inherited by the\r\nvarious peoples whose ancestors composed their empire; so that the Inca\r\ncivilization was a revival rather than a creation.\r\n\r\nThe various tribes and nations of the Andes, separated from each other\r\nby uninhabited wildernesses and lofty mountain chains, were clearly of\r\nthe same origin, speaking dialects of the same language. Since the fall\r\nof the Piruas they had led an independent existence. Some had formed\r\npowerful confederations, others were isolated in their valleys. But it\r\nwas only through much hard fighting and by consummate statesmanship\r\nthat the one small Inca lineage established, in a period of less than\r\nthree centuries, imperial dominion over the rest. It will be well, in\r\nthis place, to take a brief survey of the different nations which were\r\nto form the empire of the Incas, and of their territories.\r\n\r\nThe central Andean region, which was the home of the imperial race\r\nof Incas, extends from the water-parting between the sources of the\r\nUcayali and the basin of Lake Titicaca to the river Apurimac. It\r\nincludes wild mountain fastnesses, wide expanses of upland, grassy\r\nslopes, lofty valleys such as that in which the city of Cuzco is built,\r\nand fertile ravines, with the most lovely scenery. The inhabitants\r\ncomposed four tribes: that of the Incas in the valley of the Vilcamayu,\r\nof the Quichuas in the secluded ravines of the Apurimac tributaries,\r\nand those of the Canas and Cauchis in the mountains bordering on the\r\nTiticaca basin. These people average a height of 5 ft. 4 in., and are\r\nstrongly built. The nose is invariably aquiline, the mouth rather\r\nlarge; the eyes black or deep brown, bright, and generally deep set,\r\nwith long fine lashes. The hair is abundant and long, fine, and of\r\na deep black-brown. The men have no beards. The skin is very smooth\r\nand soft, and of a light coppery-brown color, the neck thick, and the\r\nshoulders broad, with great depth of chest. The legs are well formed,\r\nfeet and hands very small. The Incas have the build and physique of\r\nmountaineers.\r\n\r\nTo the south of this cradle of the Inca race extended the region of\r\nthe Collas[1166] and allied tribes, including the whole basin of\r\nLake Titicaca, which is 12,000 feet above the level of the sea. The\r\nCollas dwelt in stone huts, tended their flocks of llamas, and raised\r\ncrops of ocas, quinoas, and potatoes. They were divided into several\r\ntribes, and were engaged in constant feuds, their arms being slings\r\nand _ayllos_, or bolas. The Collas are remarkable for great length of\r\nbody compared with the thigh and leg, and they are the only people\r\nwhose thighs are shorter than their legs. Their build fits them for\r\nexcellence in mountain climbing and pedestrianism, and for the exercise\r\nof extraordinary endurance.[1167] The homes of the Collas were around\r\nthe seat of ancient civilization at Tiahuanacu.\r\n\r\nA remarkable race, apart from the Incas and Collas, of darker\r\ncomplexion and more savage habits, dwelt and still dwell among the\r\nvast beds of reeds in the southwestern angle of Lake Titicaca. They\r\nare called Urus, and are probably descendants of an aboriginal people\r\nwho occupied the Titicaca basin before the arrival of the Hatun-runas\r\nfrom the south. The Urus spoke a distinct language, called _Puquina_,\r\nspecimens of which have been preserved by Bishop Oré.[1168] The\r\nancestors of the Urus may have been the cromlech builders, driven\r\ninto the fastnesses of the lake when their country was occupied by\r\nthe more powerful invaders, who erected the imperishable monuments at\r\nTiahuanacu. These Urus are now lake-dwellers. Their homes consist of\r\nlarge canoes, made of the tough reeds which cover the shallow parts of\r\nthe lake, and they live on fish, and on quinua and potatoes, which they\r\nobtain by barter.\r\n\r\nNorth of Cuzco there were several allied tribes, resembling the Incas\r\nin physique and language, in a similar stage of civilization, and their\r\nrivals in power. Beyond the Apurimac, and inhabiting the valleys of the\r\nAndes thence to the Mantaro, was the important nation of the Chancas;\r\nand still further north and west, in the valley of the Xauxa, was the\r\nHuanca nation. Agricultural people and shepherds, forming _ayllus_, or\r\ntribes of the Chancas and Huancas, occupied the ravines of the maritime\r\ncordillera, and extended their settlements into several valleys of\r\nthe seacoast, between the Rimac and Nasca. These coast people of Inca\r\nrace, known as Chinchas, held their own against an entirely different\r\nnation, of distinct origin and language, who occupied the northern\r\ncoast valleys from the Rimac to Payta, and also the great valley of\r\nHuarca (the modern Cañete), where they had Chincha enemies both to\r\nthe north and south of them. These people were called _Yuncas_ by\r\ntheir Inca conquerors. Their own name was Chimu, and the language\r\nspoken by them was called _Mochica_. But this question relating to\r\nthe early inhabitants of the coast valleys of Peru, their origin and\r\ncivilization, is the most difficult in ancient Peruvian history, and\r\nwill require separate consideration.[1169]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INCA MANCO CCAPAC.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in Marcoy’s _South America_, i. 210 (also in _Tour du\r\nMonde_, 1863, p. 261), purporting to be drawn from a copy of the\r\ntaffeta roll containing the pedigree of the Incas, which, in evidence\r\nof their claims, was sent by their descendants to the Spanish king\r\nin 1603. This genealogical record contained the likenesses of the\r\nsuccessive Incas and their wives, and the original is said to have\r\ndisappeared. Mr. Markham supposes this roll to have been the original\r\nof the portraits given in Herrera (see cut on p. 267 of the present\r\nvolume); but they are not the same, if Marcoy’s cuts are trustworthy.\r\nA set of likenesses appeared in Ulloa’s _Relacion Histórica_ (Madrid,\r\n1748), iv. 604; and these were the originals of the series copied\r\nin the _Gentleman’s Mag._, 1751-1752, and thence are copied those\r\nin Ranking. These do not correspond with those given by Marcoy. See\r\n_post_, Vol. II., for a note on different series of portraits, and in\r\nthe same volume, pp. 515, 516, are portraits of Atahualpa. A portrait\r\nof Manco Inca, killed 1546, is given in A. de Beauchamp’s _Histoire de\r\nla Conquête du Pérou_ (Paris, 1808).—ED.]]\r\n\r\nNorth of the Huanca nation, along the basin of the Marañon, there were\r\ntribes which were known to the Incas by their head-dresses. These were\r\nthe Conchucus, Huamachucus, and Huacrachucus.[1170] Still further\r\nnorth, in the region of the equator, was the powerful nation of Quitus.\r\n\r\nAll these nations of the Peruvian Andes appear to have once formed part\r\nof the mighty prehistoric empire of the Pirhuas, and to have retained\r\nmuch of the civilization of their ancestors during the subsequent\r\ncenturies of separate existence and isolation. This probably accounts\r\nfor the ease with which the Incas established their system of religion\r\nand government throughout their new empire, after the conquests were\r\ncompleted. The subjugated nations spoke dialects of the same language,\r\nand inherited many of the usages and ideas of their conquerors. For\r\nthe same reason they were pretty equally matched as foes, and the\r\nIncas secured the mastery only by dint of desperate fighting and great\r\npolitical sagacity. But finally they did establish their superiority,\r\nand founded a second great empire in Peru.\r\n\r\nThe history of the rise and progress of Inca power, as recorded by\r\nnative historians in their _quipus_, and retailed to us by Spanish\r\nwriters, is, on the whole, coherent and intelligible. Many blunders\r\nwere inevitable in conveying the information from the mouths of natives\r\nto the Spanish inquirers, who understood the language imperfectly, and\r\nwhose objects often were to reach foregone conclusions. But certain\r\nbroad historical facts are brought out by a comparison of the different\r\nauthorities, the succession of the last ten sovereigns is determined\r\nby a nearly complete consensus of evidence, and we can now relate the\r\ngeneral features of the rise of Inca ascendency in Peru with a certain\r\namount of confidence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INCA YUPANQUI.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in Marcoy, i. 214.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe Inca people were divided into small _ayllus_, or lineages,\r\nwhen Manco Ccapac advanced down the valley of the Vilcamayu, from\r\nPaccari-tampu, and forced the _ayllu_ of Alcaviza and the _ayllu_ of\r\nAntasayac to submit to his sway. He formed the nucleus of his power\r\nat Cuzco, the land of these conquered _ayllus_, and from this point\r\nhis descendants slowly extended their dominion. The chiefs of the\r\nsurrounding _ayllus_, called _Sinchi_ (literally, “strong”), either\r\nsubmitted willingly to the Incas, or were subjugated. Sinchi Rocca, the\r\nson, and Lloque Yupanqui, the grandson, of Manco, filled up a swamp on\r\nthe site of the present cathedral of Cuzco, planned out the city,[1171]\r\nand their reigns were mainly occupied in consolidating the small\r\nkingdom founded by their predecessor. Mayta Ccapac, the fourth Inca,\r\nwas also occupied in consolidating his power round Cuzco; but his son,\r\nCcapac Yupanqui, subdued the Quichuas to the westward, and extended his\r\nsway as far as the pass of Vilcañota, overlooking the Collao, or basin\r\nof Lake Titicaca. Inca Rocca, the next sovereign, made few conquests,\r\ndevoting his attention to the foundation of schools, the organization\r\nof festivals and administrative government, and to the construction\r\nof public works. His son, named Yahuar-huaccac, appears to have been\r\nunfortunate. One authority says that he was surprised and killed, and\r\nall agree that his reign was disastrous. For seven generations the\r\npower and the admirable internal polity of the Incarial government\r\nhad been gradually organized and consolidated within a limited area.\r\nThe succeeding sovereigns were great conquerors, and their empire\r\nwas rapidly extended to the vast area which it had reached when the\r\nSpaniards first appeared on the scene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUZCO.\r\n\r\n[One of the cuts which did service in the Antwerp editions of Cieza de\r\nLeon. There are various views in Squier’s _Peru_, pp. 427-445.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe son of Yahuar-huaccac assumed the name of the Deity, and called\r\nhimself Uira-cocha.[1172] Intervening in a war between the two\r\nprincipal chiefs of the Collas, named Cari and Zapaña, Uira-cocha\r\ndefeated them in detail, and annexed the whole basin of Lake Titicaca\r\nto his dominions. He also conquered the lovely valley of Yucay, on the\r\nlower course of the Vilcamayu, whither he retired to end his days. The\r\neldest son of Uira-cocha, named Urco, was incompetent or unworthy, and\r\nwas either obliged to abdicate[1173] in favor of his brother Yupanqui,\r\nthe favorite hero of Inca history, or was slain.[1174] It was a moment\r\nwhen the rising empire needed the services of her ablest sons. She\r\nwas about to engage in a death-struggle with a neighbor as powerful\r\nand as civilized as herself. The kingdom of the Chancas, commencing\r\non the banks of the Apurimac, extended far to the east and north,\r\nincluding many of the richest valleys of the Andes. Their warlike king,\r\nUscavilca, had already subdued the Quichuas, who dwelt in the upper\r\nvalleys of the Apurimac tributaries to the southward, and was advancing\r\non Cuzco, when Yupanqui pushed aside the imbecile Urco, and seized\r\nthe helm. The fate of the Incas was hanging on a thread. The story is\r\none of thrilling interest as told in the pages of Betanzos, but all\r\nauthorities dwell more or less on this famous Chanca war. The decisive\r\nbattle was fought outside the Huaca-puncu, the sacred gate of Cuzco.\r\nThe result was long doubtful. Suddenly, as the shades of evening were\r\nclosing over the Yahuar-pampa,—“the field of blood,”—a fresh army fell\r\nupon the right flank of the Chanca host, and the Incas won a great\r\nvictory. So unexpected was this onslaught that the very stones on the\r\nmountain sides were believed to have been turned into men. It was the\r\narmed array of the insurgent Quichuas who had come by forced marches\r\nto the help of their old masters. The memory of this great struggle\r\nwas fresh in men’s minds when the Spaniards arrived, and as the new\r\nconquerors passed over the battlefield, on their way to Cuzco, they saw\r\nthe stuffed skins of the vanquished Chancas set up as memorials by the\r\nroadside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WARRIORS OF THE INCA PERIOD.\r\n\r\n[After a cut given by Ruge, and showing figures from an old Peruvian\r\npainting.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe subjugation of the Chancas, with their allies the Huancas, led to a\r\nvast extension of the Inca empire, which now reached to the shores of\r\nthe Pacific; and the last years of Yupanqui were passed in the conquest\r\nof the alien coast nation, ruled over by a sovereign known as the\r\nChimu. Thus the reign of the Inca Yupanqui marks a great epoch. He beat\r\ndown all rivals, and converted the Cuzco kingdom into a vast empire. He\r\nreceived the name of Pachacutec, or “he who changes the world,” a name\r\nwhich, according to Montesinos, had on eight previous occasions been\r\nconferred upon sovereigns of the more ancient dynasties.\r\n\r\nTupac Inca Yupanqui, the son and successor of Pachacutec, completed\r\nthe subjugation of the coast valleys, extended his conquests beyond\r\nQuito on the north and to Chile as far as the river Maule in the south,\r\nbesides penetrating far into the eastern forests.\r\n\r\nHuayna Ccapac, the son of Tupac Inca Yupanqui, completed and\r\nconsolidated the conquests of his father. He traversed the valleys of\r\nthe coast, penetrated to the southern limit of Chile, and fought a\r\nmemorable battle on the banks of the “lake of blood” (Yahuar-cocha),\r\nnear the northern frontier of Quito. After a long reign,[1175] the last\r\nyears of which were passed in Quito, Huayna Ccapac died in November,\r\n1525. His eldest legitimate son, named Huascar, succeeded him at Cuzco.\r\nBut Atahualpa, his father’s favorite, was at Quito with the most\r\nexperienced generals. Haughty messages passed between the brothers,\r\nwhich were followed by war. Huascar’s armies were defeated in detail,\r\nand eventually the generals of Atahualpa took the legitimate Inca\r\nprisoner, entered Cuzco, and massacred the family and adherents of\r\nHuascar.[1176] The successful aspirant to the throne was on his way to\r\nCuzco, in the wake of his generals, when he encountered Pizarro and the\r\nSpanish invaders at Caxamarca. This war of succession would not, it is\r\nprobable, have led to any revolutionary change in the general policy of\r\nthe empire. Atahualpa would have established his power and continued to\r\nrule, just as his ancestor Pachacutec did, after the dethronement of\r\nhis brother Urco.[1177]\r\n\r\nThe succession of the Incas from Manco Ccapac to Atahualpa was\r\nevidently well known to the Amautas, or learned men of the empire,\r\nand was recorded in their _quipus_ with precision, together with\r\nless certain materials respecting the more ancient dynasties. Many\r\nblunders were committed by the Spanish inquirers in putting down the\r\nhistorical information received from the Amautas, but on the whole\r\nthere is general concurrence among them.[1178] Practically the Spanish\r\nauthorities agree, and it is clear that the native annalists possessed\r\na single record, while the apparent discrepancies are due to blunders\r\nof the Spanish transcribers. The twelve Incas from Manco Ccapac to\r\nHuascar may be received as historical personages whose deeds were had\r\nin memory at the time of the Spanish invasion, and were narrated to\r\nthose among the conquerors who sought for information from the Amautas.\r\n\r\n  A.D.                             | A.D.\r\n  1240—Manco Ccapac.               | 1360—Yahuar-huaccac.\r\n  1260—Sinchi Rocca.               | 1380—Uira-cocha.\r\n  1280—Lloque Yupanqui.            | 1400—Pachacutec Yupanqui.\r\n  1300—Mayta Ccapac.               | 1440—Tupac Yupanqui.\r\n  1320—Ccapac Yupanqui.            | 1480—Huayna Ccapac.\r\n  1340—Inca Rocca.                 | 1523—Inti Cusi Hualpa, or Huascar.\r\n\r\nThe religion of the Incas consisted in the worship of the supreme\r\nbeing of the earlier dynasties, the Illa Ticsi Uira-cocha of the\r\nPirhuas. This simple faith was overlaid by a vast mass of superstition,\r\nrepresented by the cult of ancestors and the cult of natural objects.\r\nTo this was superadded the belief in the ideals or souls of all\r\nanimated things, which ruled and guided them, and to which men\r\nmight pray for help. The exact nature of this belief in ideals, as\r\nit presented itself to the people themselves, is not at all clear.\r\nIt prevailed among the uneducated. Probably it was the idea to\r\nwhich dreams give rise,—the idea of a double nature, of a tangible\r\nand a phantom being, the latter mysterious and powerful, and to be\r\npropitiated. The belief in this double being was extended to all\r\nanimated nature, for even the crops had their spiritual doubles, which\r\nit was necessary to worship and propitiate.\r\n\r\nBut the religion of the Incas and of learned men, or Amautas, was a\r\nworship of the Supreme Cause of all things, the ancient God of the\r\nTiticaca myth, combined with veneration for the sun[1179] as the\r\nancestor of the reigning dynasty, for the other heavenly bodies, and\r\nfor the _malqui_, or remains of their forefathers. This feeling of\r\nveneration for the sun, closely connected with the beneficent work of\r\nthe venerated object as displayed in the course of the seasons, led to\r\nthe growth of an elaborate ritual and to the celebration of periodical\r\nfestivals.\r\n\r\nThe weight of evidence is decisively in the direction of a belief on\r\nthe part of the Incas that a Supreme Being existed, which the sun must\r\nobey, as well as all other parts of the universe. This subordination\r\nof the sun to the Creator of all things was inculcated by successive\r\nIncas. Molina says, “They did not know the sun as their Creator, but\r\nas created by the Creator.” Salcamayhua tells us how the Inca Mayta\r\nCcapac taught that the sun and moon were made for the service of men,\r\nand that the chief of the Collas, addressing the Inca Uira-cocha,\r\nexclaimed, “Thou, O powerful lord of Cuzco, dost worship the teacher of\r\nthe universe, while I, the chief of the Collas, worship the Sun.” The\r\nevidence on the subject of the religion of the Incas, collected by the\r\nViceroy Toledo, showed that they worshipped the Creator of all things,\r\nthough they also venerated the sun; and Montesinos mentions an edict\r\nof the Inca Pachacutec, promulgated with the object of enforcing the\r\nworship of the Supreme God above all other deities. The speech of Tupac\r\nInca Yupanqui, showing that the sun was not God, but was obeying laws\r\nordained by God, is recorded by Acosta, Blas Valera, and Balboa, and\r\nwas evidently deeply impressed on the minds of their Inca informers.\r\nThis Inca compared the sun to a tethered beast, which always makes the\r\nsame round; or to a dart, which goes where it is sent, and not where\r\nit wishes. The prayers from the Inca ritual, given by Molina, are\r\naddressed to the god Ticsi Uira-cocha; the Sun, Moon, and Thunder being\r\noccasionally invoked in conjunction with the principal deity.\r\n\r\nThe worship of this creating God, the Dweller in Space, the Teacher\r\nand Ruler of the Universe, was, then, the religion of the Incas which\r\nhad been inherited from their distant ancestry of the cyclopean age.\r\nAround this primitive cult had grown up a supplemental worship of\r\ncreatures created by the Deity, such as the heavenly bodies, and of\r\nobjects supposed to represent the first ancestors of _ayllus_, or\r\ntribes, as well as of the prototypes of things on whom man’s welfare\r\ndepended, such as flocks and animals of the chase, fruit and corn.\r\nIt has been asserted that the Deity, the Uira-cocha himself, did not\r\ngenerally receive worship, and that there was only one temple in\r\nhonor of God throughout the empire, at a place called Pachacamac, on\r\nthe coast. But this is clearly a mistake. The great temple at Cuzco,\r\nwith its gorgeous display of riches, was called the “Ccuri-cancha\r\nPacha-yachachicpa huasin,” which means “the place of gold, the abode\r\nof the Teacher of the Universe.” An elliptical plate of gold was fixed\r\non the wall to represent the Deity, flanked on either side by metal\r\nrepresentations of his creatures, the Sun and Moon. The chief festival\r\nin the middle of the year, called Ccapac Raymi, was instituted in\r\nhonor of the supreme Creator, and when, from time to time, his worship\r\nbegan to be neglected by the people, who were apt to run after the\r\nnumerous local deities, it was again and again enforced by their more\r\nenlightened rulers. There were Ccuri-canchas for the service of God, at\r\nVilca and in other centres of vice-regal rule, besides the grand fane\r\nof Cuzco.[1180]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in Marcoy, i. p. 234, where it is said to be drawn from\r\nexisting remains and printed and manuscript authorities.

The\r\n_Paccarina_, or forefather of the _ayllu_, or lineage, was often some\r\nnatural object converted into a _huaca_, or deity. The _Paccarina_ of\r\nthe Inca family was the Sun; with his sister and spouse, the Moon.\r\nA vast hierarchy was set apart to conduct the ceremonies connected\r\nwith their worship, and hundreds of virgins, called _Aclla-cuna_,\r\nwere secluded and devoted to duties relating to the observances\r\nin the Sun temples. Worship was also offered to the actual bodies\r\nof the ancestors, called _malqui_, which were preserved with the\r\ngreatest care, in caves called _machay_. On solemn festivals each\r\n_ayllu_ assembled with its _malqui_. The bodies of the Incas were all\r\npreserved, clothed as when alive, and surrounded by their special\r\nfurniture and utensils. Three of these Inca mummies, with two mummies\r\nof queens, were discovered by Polo de Ondegardo, then corregidor of\r\nCuzco, in 1559, and were sent by him to Lima for interment. Those who\r\nsaw them[1182] reported that they were so well preserved that they\r\nappeared to be alive; that they were in a sitting posture; that the\r\neyes were made of gold, and that they were arrayed in the insignia\r\nof their rank.[1183] The _Paccarina_, or founder of the family, and\r\nthe _malquis_, or mummies of ancestors, thus formed the objects of a\r\ndistinct belief and religion, based undoubtedly on the conviction that\r\nevery human being has a spiritual as well as a corporeal existence;\r\nthat the former is immortal, and that it is represented by the\r\n_malqui_. The appearance of the departed in dreams and visions was not\r\nan unreasonable ground for this belief, which certainly was the most\r\ndeeply rooted of all the religious ideas of the Peruvian people. The\r\n_paccarina_, or ancestral deities, were innumerable. There was one or\r\nmore that received worship in every _tribe_, and was represented by a\r\nrock, or some other natural object. Many were believed to be oracles.\r\nSome, such as _Catequilla_, or _Apu-catequilla_,[1184] the oracle of\r\nthe Conchucu tribe, have been brought into undue prominence through\r\nbeing mentioned by Spanish writers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZODIAC OF GOLD FOUND AT CUZCO.\r\n\r\n[After a drawing by Mr. Markham of the plate itself, made at Lima in\r\n1853. Mr. Markham’s drawing is reproduced in Bollaert’s _Antiquarian\r\nResearches_, p. 146. The disk is 5-3/10 inches in diameter. The signs\r\nin the outer ring are supposed to represent the months.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nReligious ceremonials were closely connected with the daily life of\r\nthe people, and especially with the course of the seasons and the\r\nsuccession of months, as they affected the operations of agriculture.\r\nIt was important to fix the equinoxes and solstices, and astronomical\r\nknowledge was a part of the priestly office. There were names for\r\nmany of the stars; their motions were watched as well as those of the\r\nsun and moon; and though a record of the extent of the astronomical\r\nknowledge of the Incas has not been preserved, it is certain that they\r\nwatched the time of the solstices and equinoxes with great care, and\r\nthat they distinguished between the lunar and solar years. Pillars were\r\nerected to determine the time of the solstices, eight on the east and\r\neight on the west side of Cuzco, in double rows, four and four, two low\r\nbetween two higher ones, twenty feet apart. They were called _Sucanca_,\r\nfrom _suca_, a ridge or furrow, the alternate light and shade between\r\nthe pillars appearing like furrows. A stone column in the centre of a\r\nlevel platform, called _Inti-huatana_, was used to ascertain the time\r\nof the equinoxes. A line was drawn across the platform from east to\r\nwest, and watch was kept to observe when the shadow of the pillar was\r\non this line from sunrise to sunset, and there was no shadow at noon.\r\nThe principal _Inti-huatana_ was in the square before the great temple\r\nat Cuzco; but there are several others in different parts of Peru.\r\nThe most perfect of these observatories is at Pissac, in the valley\r\nof Vilcamayu.[1185] There is another at Ollantay-tampu, a fourth near\r\nAbancay, and a fifth at Sillustani in the Collao.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the Incas used a zodiac with twelve\r\nsigns, corresponding with the months of their solar year. The gold\r\nplates which they wore on their breasts were stamped with features\r\nrepresenting the sun, surrounded by a border of what are probably\r\neither zodiacal signs or signs for the months. Whether the ecliptic, or\r\n_huatana_, was thus divided or not, it is certain that the sun’s motion\r\nwas observed with great care, and that the calendar was thus fixed with\r\nsome approach to accuracy.[1186] The year, or _Huata_, was divided into\r\ntwelve _Quilla_, or moon revolutions, and these were made to correspond\r\nwith the solar year by adding five days, which were divided among the\r\ntwelve months. A further correction was made every fourth year. Solar\r\nobservations were taken and recorded every month.\r\n\r\nThe year commenced on the 22d of June, with the winter solstice, and\r\nthere were four great festivals at the occurrence of the solstices and\r\nequinoxes.[1187]\r\n\r\nThe celebrations of the solar year and of the seasons, in their\r\nbearings on agriculture, were identical with the chief religious\r\nobservances. The Raymi, or festival of the winter solstice, in the\r\nfirst month, when the granaries were filled after harvest, was\r\nestablished in special honor of the Sun. Sacrifices of llamas and\r\nlambs, and of the first-fruits of the earth, were offered up to the\r\nimages of the Supreme Being, of the Sun, and of Thunder, which were\r\nplaced in the open space in front of the great temple; as well as to\r\nthe _huaca_, or stone representing the brother of Manco Ccapac, on the\r\nhill of Huanacauri. There was also a procession of the priests and\r\npeople as far as the pass of Vilcañota, leading into the basin of Lake\r\nTiticaca, sacrifices being offered up at various spots on the road.\r\nThe sacrifices were accompanied by prayers, and concluded with songs,\r\ncalled _huayllina_, and dancing. Then followed the ploughing month,\r\nwhen it is said that the Inca himself opened the season by ploughing a\r\nfurrow with a golden plough in the field behind the Colcampata palace,\r\non the height above Cuzco.\r\n\r\nThe question here arises whether human sacrifices were offered up,\r\nin the Inca ritual. This has been stated by Molina, Cieza de Leon,\r\nMontesinos, Balboa, Ondegardo, and Acosta, and indignantly denied by\r\nGarcilasso de la Vega. Cieza de Leon admits that there were occasional\r\nhuman sacrifices, but adds that their numbers and the frequency\r\nof such offerings have been grossly exaggerated by the Spaniards.\r\nIf the sacrifices had been offered under the idea of atonement or\r\nexpiation, it might well be expected that human sacrifices would be\r\nincluded. Under such ideas, men offered up what they valued most, just\r\nas Abraham was prepared to sacrifice his son, as Jephthah dedicated\r\nhis daughter as a burnt-offering to Jehovah, and as the king of Moab\r\nsacrificed his eldest son to Chemosh.[1188] But, except in the Situa,\r\nwhen the idea was to efface sins by washing, the sacrifices of the\r\nIncas were offerings of thanksgiving, not of expiation or atonement.\r\nThe mistake of the five writers who supposed that the Incas offered\r\nhuman sacrifices was due to their ignorance of the language.[1189] The\r\nperpetration of human sacrifice was opposed to the religious ideas of\r\nthe ancient Peruvians, and formed no part of their ceremonial worship.\r\nTheir ritual was almost exclusively devoted to thanksgiving and\r\nrejoicings over the beneficence of their Deity. The notion of expiation\r\nformed no part of their creed, while the destruction involved in such\r\na system was opposed to their economic and carefully regulated civil\r\npolity.[1190]\r\n\r\nThe second great festival, called Situa, was celebrated at the vernal\r\nequinox. This was the commencement of the rainy season, when sickness\r\nprevailed, and the object of the ceremony was to pray to the Creator\r\nto drive diseases and evils from the land. In the centre of the great\r\nsquare of Cuzco a body of four hundred warriors was assembled, fully\r\narmed for war. One hundred faced towards the Chincha-suyu road, one\r\nhundred faced towards Anti-suyu, one hundred towards Colla-suyu, and\r\none hundred towards Cunti-suyu,—the four great divisions of the empire.\r\nThe Inca and the high-priest, with their attendants, then came from\r\nthe temple, and shouted, “Go forth all evils!” On the instant the\r\nwarriors ran at great speed towards the four quarters, shouting the\r\nsame sentence as they went, until they each came to another party,\r\nwhich took up the cry, and the last parties reached the banks of great\r\nrivers, the Apurimac or Vilcamayu, where they bathed and washed their\r\narms. The rivers were supposed to carry the evils away to the ocean.\r\nAs the warriors ran through the streets of Cuzco, all the people came\r\nto their doors, shaking their clothes, and shouting, “Let the evils be\r\ngone!” In the evening they all bathed; then they lighted great torches\r\nof straw, called _pancurcu_, and, marching in procession out of the\r\ncity, they threw them into the rivers, believing that thus nocturnal\r\nevils were banished. At night, each family partook of a supper\r\nconsisting of pudding made of coarsely ground maize, called _sancu_,\r\nwhich was also smeared over their faces and the lintels of their\r\ndoorways, then washed off and thrown into the rivers with the cry, “May\r\nwe be free from sickness, and may no maladies enter our houses!” The\r\n_huacas_ and _malquis_ were also bathed at the feast of Situa. In the\r\nfollowing days all the malquis were paraded, and there were sacrifices,\r\nwith feasting and dancing. A stone fountain, plated with gold, stood\r\nin the great square of Cuzco, and the Inca, on this and other solemn\r\nfestivals, poured _chicha_ into it from a golden vase, which was\r\nconducted by subterranean pipes to the temple.\r\n\r\nThe third great festival at the summer solstice, called _Huaracu_,\r\nwas the occasion on which the youths of the empire were admitted\r\nto a rank equivalent to knighthood, after passing through a severe\r\nordeal. The Inca and his court were assembled in front of the temple.\r\nThither the youths were conducted by their relations, with heads\r\nclosely shorn, and attired in shirts of fine yellow wool edged with\r\nblack, and white mantles fastened round their necks by woollen cords\r\nwith red tassels. They made their reverences to the Inca, offered up\r\nprayers, and each presented a llama for sacrifice.[1191] Proceeding\r\nthence to the hill of Huanacauri, where the venerated _huaca_ to Ayar\r\nUchu was erected, they there received _huaras_, or breeches made of\r\naloe fibres, from the priest. This completed their manly attire, and\r\nthey returned home to prepare for the ordeal. A few days afterwards\r\nthey were assembled in the great square, received a spear, called\r\n_yauri_, and _usutas_ or sandals, and were severely whipped to prove\r\ntheir endurance. The young candidates were then sent forth to pass the\r\nnight in a desert about a league from Cuzco. Next day they had to run\r\na race. At the farther end of the course young girls were stationed,\r\ncalled _ñusta-calli-sapa_,[1192] with jars of chicha, who cried, “Come\r\nquickly, youths, for we are waiting!” but the course was a long one,\r\nand many fell before they reached the goal. They also had to rival each\r\nother in assaults and feats of arms. Finally their ears were bored, and\r\nthey received ear-pieces of gold and other marks of distinction from\r\nthe Inca. The last ceremony was that of bathing in the fountain called\r\nCalli-puquio. About eight hundred youths annually passed through this\r\nordeal, and became adult warriors, at Cuzco, and similar ceremonies\r\nwere performed in all the provinces of the empire.\r\n\r\nIn the month following on the summer solstice, there was a curious\r\nreligious ceremony known as the water sacrifice. The cinders and ashes\r\nof all the numerous sacrifices throughout the year were preserved.\r\nDams were constructed across the rivers which flow through Cuzco, in\r\norder that the water might rush down with great force when they were\r\ntaken away. Prayers and sacrifices were offered up, and then a little\r\nafter sunset all the ashes were thrown into the rivers and the dams\r\nwere removed. Then the burnt-sacrifices were hurried down with the\r\nstream, closely followed by crowds of people on either bank, with\r\nblazing torches, as far as the bridge at Ollantay-tampu. There two bags\r\nof coca were offered up by being hurled into the river, and thence\r\nthe sacrifices were allowed to flow onwards to the sea. This curious\r\nceremony seems to have been intended not only as a thank-offering\r\nto the Deity, but as an acknowledgment of his omnipresence. As the\r\nofferings flowed with the stream, they knew not whither, yet went to\r\nHim, so his pervading spirit was everywhere, alike in parts unknown as\r\nin the visible world of the Incas.\r\n\r\nA sacred fire was kept alive throughout the year by the virgins of the\r\nsun, and the ceremony of its annual renewal at the autumnal equinox was\r\nthe fourth great festival, called _Mosoc-nina_, or the “new fire.” Fire\r\nwas produced by collecting the sun’s rays on a burnished metal mirror,\r\nand the ceremony was the occasion of prayers and sacrifices. The year\r\nended with the rejoicing of the harvest months, accompanied by songs,\r\ndances, and other festivities.\r\n\r\nBesides the periodical festivals, there were also religious observances\r\nwhich entered into the life of each family. Every household had one or\r\nmore _lares_, called _Conopa_, representing maize, fruit, a llama, or\r\nother object on which its welfare depended. The belief in divination\r\nand soothsaying, the practice of fasting followed by confession, and\r\nworship of the family malqui, all gave employment to the priesthood.\r\n\r\nThe complicated religious ceremonies connected with the periodical\r\nfestivals, the daily worship, and the requirements of private\r\nfamilies gave rise to the growth of a very numerous caste of priests\r\nand diviners. The pope of this hierarchy, the chief pontiff, was\r\ncalled _Uillac Umu_, words meaning “The head which gives counsel,”\r\nhe who repeats to the people the utterances of the Deity. He was the\r\nmost learned and virtuous of the priestly caste, always a member of\r\nthe reigning family, and next in rank to the Inca. The _Villcas_,\r\nequivalent to the bishops of a Christian hierarchy, were the chief\r\npriests in the provinces, and during the greatest extension of the\r\nempire they numbered ten. The ordinary ministers of religion were\r\ndivided into sacrificers, worshippers and confessors, diviners, and\r\nrecluses.[1193] It was indeed inevitable that, with a complicated\r\nritual and a gorgeous ceremonial worship, a populous class of priests\r\nand their assistants, of numerous grades and callings, should come into\r\nexistence.[1194]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the intellectual movement and vigor of the Incas were not confined\r\nto the priesthood. The Amautas or learned men, the poets and reciters\r\nof history, the musical and dramatic composers, the Quipu-camayoc, or\r\nrecorders and accountants, were not necessarily, nor indeed generally,\r\nof the priestly caste. It is probable that the Amautas, or men of\r\nlearning, formed a separate caste devoted to the cultivation of\r\nliterature and the extension of the language. Our knowledge of their\r\nprogress and of the character of their traditions and poetic culture is\r\nvery limited, owing to the destruction of records and the loss of oral\r\ntestimony. The language has been preserved, and that will tell us much;\r\nbut only a few literary compositions have been saved from the wreck of\r\nthe Inca empire. Quichua was the name given to the general language of\r\nthe Incas by Friar Domingo de San Tomas, the first Spaniard who studied\r\nit grammatically, possibly owing to his having acquired it from people\r\nbelonging to the Quichua tribe. The name continued to be used, and\r\nhas been generally adopted.[1195] Garcilasso de la Vega speaks of a\r\nseparate court language of the Incas, but the eleven words he gives as\r\nbelonging to it are ordinary Quichua words, and I concur with Hervas\r\nand William von Humboldt in the conclusion that this court language\r\nof Garcilasso had no real existence.[1196] It is not mentioned by any\r\nother authority.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE QUIPUS.\r\n\r\n[Following a sketch in Rivero and Tschudi, as reproduced by Helps.\r\nIt shows a quipu found in an ancient cemetery near Pachacamac.

Leclerc, No. 2412, mentions a\r\n_Letter a apologetica_ (Napoli, 1750), pertaining to the quipus, but\r\nseems uncertain as to its value.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nIt was the custom for the Yaravecs or Bards to recite the deeds of\r\nformer Incas on public occasions, and these rhythmical narratives\r\nwere orally preserved and handed down by the learned men. Cieza de\r\nLeon tells us that “by this plan, from the mouths of one generation\r\nthe succeeding one was taught, and they could relate what took place\r\nfive hundred years ago as if only ten years had passed. This was the\r\norder that was taken to prevent the great events of the empire from\r\nfalling into oblivion.” These historical recitations and songs must\r\nhave formed the most important part of Inca literature. One specimen\r\nof imaginative poetry has been preserved by Blas Valero, in which\r\nthe thunder, followed by rain, is likened to a brother breaking his\r\nsister’s pitcher; just as in the Scandinavian mythology the legend\r\nwhich is the original source of our nursery rhyme of Jack and Jill\r\nemploys the same imagery. Pastoral duties are embodied in some of\r\nthe later Quichuan dramatic literature, and numerous love songs and\r\n_yaravies_, or elegies, have been handed down orally, or preserved in\r\nold manuscripts. The dances were numerous and complicated, and the\r\nIncas had many musical instruments.[1197] Dramatic representations,\r\nboth of a tragic and comic character, were performed before the\r\nInca court. The statement of Garcilasso de la Vega to this effect\r\nis supported by the independent evidence of Cieza de Leon and of\r\nSalcamayhua, and is placed beyond a doubt by the sentence of the judge,\r\nAreche, in 1781, who prohibited the celebration of these dramas by the\r\nIndians. Father Iteri also speaks of the “Quichua dramas transmitted to\r\nthis day (1790) by an unbroken tradition.” But only one such drama has\r\nbeen handed down to our own time. It is entitled Ollantay, and records\r\nan historical event of the time of Yupanqui Pachacutec. In its present\r\nform, as regards division into scenes and stage directions, it shows\r\nlater Spanish manipulation. The question of its antiquity has been much\r\ndiscussed; but the final result is that Quichua scholars believe most\r\nof its dialogues and speeches and all the songs to be remnants of the\r\nInca period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INCA SKULL.\r\n\r\n[After the plate in the _Contrib. to N.

To cords of various\r\ncolors smaller lines were attached in the form of fringe, on which\r\nthere were knots in an almost infinite variety of combination. The\r\n_Quipu-camayoc_, or accountant, could by this means keep records\r\nunder numerous heads, and preserve the accounts of the empire. The\r\n_quipus_ represented a far better system of keeping accounts than the\r\nexchequer tallies which were used in England for the same purpose\r\nas late as the early part of the present century. But the question\r\nof the extent to which historical events could be recorded by this\r\nsystem of knots is a difficult one. We have the direct assertions\r\nof Montesinos, Salcamayhua, the anonymous Jesuit, Blas Valera, and\r\nothers, that not only narratives, but songs, were preserved by means of\r\nthe _quipus_. Von Tschudi believed that by dint of the uninterrupted\r\nstudies of experts during several generations, the power of expression\r\nbecame developed more and more, and that eventually the art of the\r\n_Quipu-camayoc_ reached a high state of perfection. It may reasonably\r\nbe assumed that with some help from oral commentary, codes of laws,\r\nhistorical events, and even poems were preserved in the _quipus_.\r\nIt was through this substitute for writing that Montesinos and the\r\nanonymous Jesuit received their lists of ancient dynasties, and Blas\r\nValera distinctly says that the poem he has preserved was taken from\r\n_quipus_. Still it must have been rather a system of mnemonics than of\r\ncomplete record. Molina tells us that the events in the reigns of all\r\nthe Incas, as well as early traditions, were represented by paintings\r\non boards, in a temple near Cuzco, called _Poquen cancha_.\r\n\r\nThe diviners used certain incantations to cure the sick, but the\r\nhealing art among the Incas was really in the hands of learned men.\r\nThose _Amautas_ who devoted themselves to the study of medicine had, as\r\nAcosta bears testimony, a knowledge of the properties of many plants.\r\nThe febrifuge virtues of the precious _quinquina_ were, it is true,\r\nunknown, or only locally known. But the _Amautas_ used plants with\r\ntonic properties for curing fevers; and they were provided with these\r\nand other drugs by an itinerant caste, called Calahuayas or Charisanis,\r\nwho went into the forests to procure them. The descendants of these\r\nitinerant doctors still wander over South America, selling drugs.[1198]\r\nThe discovery of a skull in a cemetery at Yucay, which exhibits clear\r\nevidence of a case of trepanning before death, proves the marvellous\r\nadvances made by the Incas in surgical science.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS AT CHUCUITO.\r\n\r\n[After a drawing in Squier’s _Primeval Monuments of Peru_, p. 17,\r\nshowing a wall of hewn stones, with an entrance.

Squier’s\r\n_Peru_, p. 354.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe sovereign was the centre of all civilization and all knowledge.\r\nAll literary culture, all the religious ceremonial which had grown\r\nup with the extension of the empire, had the Inca for their centre,\r\nas well as all the military operations and all laws connected with\r\ncivil administration. Originally but the _Sinchi_, or chief of a small\r\n_ayllu_, the greatness of successive Incas grew with the extension of\r\ntheir power, until at last they were looked upon almost as deities by\r\ntheir subjects. The greatest lords entered their presence in a stooping\r\nposition and with a small burden on their backs. The imperial family\r\nrapidly increased. Each Inca left behind him numerous younger sons,\r\nwhose descendants formed an _ayllu_, so that the later sovereigns\r\nwere surrounded by a numerous following of their own kindred, from\r\namong whom able public servants were selected. The sovereign was the\r\n“_Sapallan Inca_,” the sole and sovereign lord, and with good reason he\r\nwas called _Huaccha-cuyac_, or friend of the poor.\r\n\r\nEnormous wealth was sent to Cuzco as tribute from all parts of the\r\nempire, for the service of the court and of the temples. The special\r\ninsignia of the sovereign were the _llautu_, or crimson fringe\r\nround the forehead, the wing feathers (black and white) of the\r\nalcamari, an Andean vulture, on the head, forming together the _suntu\r\npaucar_ or sacred head-dress; the _huaman champi_, or mace, and the\r\n_ccapac-yauri_, or sceptre. His dress consisted of shirts of cotton,\r\ntunics of dyed cotton in patterns, with borders of small gold and\r\nsilver plates or feathers, and mantles of fine vicuña wool woven and\r\ndyed. The Incas, as represented in the pictures at Cuzco,[1199] painted\r\nsoon after the conquest, wore golden breastplates suspended round their\r\nnecks, with the image of the sun stamped upon them;[1200] and the\r\n_Ccoya_, or queen, wore a large golden _topu_, or pin, with figures\r\nengraved on the head, which secured her _lliclla_, or mantle. All\r\nthe utensils of the palace were of gold; and so exclusively was that\r\nprecious metal used in the service of the court and the temple that\r\na garden outside the Ccuri-cancha was planted with models of leaves,\r\nfruit, and stalks made of pure gold.[1201]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAKE TITICACA.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in Ruge’s _Gesch. des Zeital. der Entdeckungen_. Squier\r\nexplored the lake with Raimond in 1864-65, and bears testimony to the\r\ngeneral accuracy of the survey by J. B. Pentland, British consul in\r\nBolivia (1827-28 and 1837), published by the British admiralty; but\r\nSquier points out some defects of his survey in his _Remarques sur la\r\nGéog. du Pérou_, p. 14, and in _Journal Amer. Geog. Soc._, iii. There\r\nis another view in Wiener’s _Pérou et Bolivie_, p. 441. Cf.

Squier in his\r\n_Peru_ (pp. 308-370) gives various views, plans of the ruins, and a map\r\nof the lake.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nTwo styles are discernible in Inca architecture. The earliest is\r\nan imitation of the cyclopean works of their ancestors on a smaller\r\nscale. The walls were built with polygonal-shaped stones with rough\r\nsurfaces, but the stones were much reduced in size. Rows of doorways\r\nwith slanting sides and monolithic lintels adorn the façades; while\r\nrecesses for _huacas_, shaped like the doorways, occur in the interior\r\nwalls. Part of the palace called the Collcampata, at the foot of the\r\nCuzco fortress, the buildings which were added to the cyclopean work at\r\nOllantay tampu, the older portion of the Ccuri-cancha temple at Cuzco,\r\nthe palaces at Chinchero and Rimac-tampu, are in this earlier style.\r\nThe later style is seen mainly at Cuzco, where the stones are laid in\r\nregular courses. No one has described this superb masonry better than\r\nSquier.[1202] No cement or mortar of any kind was used, the edifices\r\ndepending entirely on the accuracy of their stone-fitting for their\r\nstability. The palaces and temples were built round a court-yard,\r\nand a hall of vast dimensions, large enough for ceremonies on an\r\nextensive scale, was included in the plan of most of the edifices.\r\nThese halls were 200 paces long by 50 to 60 broad. The dimensions of\r\nthe Ccuri-cancha temple were 296 feet by 52, and the southwest end\r\nwas apsidal. Serpents are carved in relief on some of the stones and\r\nlintels of the Cuzco palaces. Hence the palace of Huayna Ccapac is\r\ncalled Amaru-cancha.[1203] At Hatun-colla, near Lake Titicaca, there\r\nare two sandstone pillars, probably of Inca origin, which are very\r\nrichly carved. They are covered with figures of serpents, lizards,\r\nand frogs, and with elaborate geometrical patterns. The height of the\r\nwalls of the Cuzco edifices was from 35 to 40 feet, and the roofs were\r\nthatched. One specimen of the admirable thatching of the Incas is still\r\npreserved at Azangaro.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAKE TITICACA.\r\n\r\n[One of the cuts which did service in the Antwerp editions of Cieza de\r\nLeon.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThere are many ruins throughout Peru both in the earlier and later\r\nstyles; some of them, such as those at Vilcashuaman and Huanuco el\r\nviejo, being of great interest. The Inca palace on the island in Lake\r\nTiticaca is a rectangular two-storied edifice, with numerous rooms\r\nhaving ceilings formed of flat overlapping stones, laid with great\r\nregularity. With its esplanade, beautiful terraced gardens, baths,\r\nand fountains, this Titicaca palace must have been intended for the\r\nenjoyment of beautiful scenery in comparative seclusion, like the now\r\ndestroyed palace at Yucay, in the valley of the Vilcamayu.\r\n\r\nAn example of the improvement of architecture after Inca subjugation is\r\nshown in the curious burial-places, or _chulpas_, of the Collao, in the\r\nbasin of Lake Titicaca. The earliest, as seen at Acora near the lake,\r\nclosely resemble the rude cromlechs of Brittany. Next, roughly built\r\nsquare towers are met with, with vaults inside. Lastly, the _chulpas_\r\nat Sillustani are well-built circular towers, about 40 feet high and\r\n16 feet in diameter at the base, widening as they rise. A cornice\r\nruns round each tower, about three fourths of the distance from the\r\nbase to the summit. The stones are admirably cut and fitted in nearly\r\neven courses, like the walls at Cuzco. The interior circular vaults,\r\nwhich contained the bodies, were arched with overlapping stones, and a\r\nsimilar dome formed the roof of the towers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF TITICACA, WITH WIENER’S ROUTE.]\r\n\r\nThe architectural excellence reached by the Incas, their advances in\r\nthe other arts and in literature, and the imperial magnificence of\r\ntheir court and religious worship, imply the existence of an orderly\r\nand well-regulated administrative system. An examination of their\r\nsocial polity will not disappoint even high expectations. The Inca,\r\nthough despotic in theory, was bound by the complicated code of rules\r\nand customs which had gradually developed itself during the reigns of\r\nhis ancestors. In his own extensive family, composed of Auqui[1204]\r\nand Atauchi,[1205] Palla[1206] and Ñusta,[1207] to the number of many\r\nhundreds,[1208] and in the Curacas[1209] and Apu-curacas[1210] of the\r\nconquered tribes, he had a host of able public servants to govern\r\nprovinces, enter the priesthood, or command armies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRIMEVAL TOMB, ACORA.\r\n\r\n[After a sketch in Squier’s _Primeval Monuments of Peru_, Salem, 1870.\r\nHe considers it an example of some of the oldest of human monuments,\r\nand is inclined to believe these chulpas, or burial monuments, to have\r\nbeen built by the ancestors of the Peruvians of the conquest in their\r\nearliest development.—ED.]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS AT QUELLENATA.\r\n\r\n[Reduced from a sketch in Squier’s _Primeval Monuments of Peru_, p. 7.\r\nThey are situated in Bolivia, northeast of Lake Titicaca, and the cut\r\nshows a hill-fortress (pucura) and the round, flaring-top burial towers\r\n(chulpas). Cf. cut in Wiener’s _Pérou et Bolivie_, p. 538.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe empire was marked out into four great divisions, corresponding\r\nwith the four cardinal points of a compass placed at Cuzco. To the\r\nnorth was Chinchaysuyu, to the east Anti-suyu, to the west Cunti-suyu,\r\nand to the south Colla-suyu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS AT ESCOMA, BOLIVIA.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in Squier’s _Primeval Monuments of Peru_, p. 9,—a square\r\ntwo-storied burial tower (chulpa) with hill-fortress (pucura) in the\r\ndistance, situated east of Lake Titicaca.

Cf. plan and views in Squier’s _Peru_, ch. 20.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe whole empire was called Ttahuantin-suyu, or the four united\r\nprovinces. Each great province was governed by an Inca viceroy, whose\r\ntitle was _Ccapac_, or _Tucuyricoc_.[1211] The latter word means “He\r\nwho sees all.” Garcilasso describes the office as merely that of an\r\ninspector, whose duty it was to visit the province and report. Under\r\nthe viceroy were the native _Curacas_, who governed the _ayllus_, or\r\nlineages. Each _ayllu_ was divided into sections of ten families, under\r\nan officer called _Chunca_ (10) _camayu_. Ten of these came under a\r\n_Pachaca_ (100) _camayu_. Ten _Pachacas_ formed a _Huaranca_ (1,000)\r\n_camayu_, and the _Hunu_ (10,000) _camayu_ ruled over ten _Huarancas_.\r\nThe _Chunca_ of ten families was the unit of government, and each\r\n_Chunca_ formed a complete community.[1212]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUINS OF AN INCARIAL VILLAGE.\r\n\r\n[Situated on the road from Milo to Huancayo. Reduced from an ink\r\ndrawing given by Wiener in his _L’Empire des Incas_, pl. v.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe cultivable land belonged to the people in their _ayllus_, each\r\n_Chunca_ being allotted a sufficient area to support its ten _Purics_\r\nand their dependants.[1213] The produce was divided between the\r\ngovernment (_Inca_), the priesthood (_Huaca_), and the cultivators or\r\npoor (_Huaccha_), but not in equal shares.[1214] In some parts the\r\nthree shares were kept apart in cultivation, but as a rule the produce\r\nwas divided at harvest time. The flocks of llamas were divided into\r\n_Ccapac-llama_, belonging to the state, and _Huaccha-llama_, owned by\r\nthe people. Thus the land belonged to the _ayllu_, or tribe, and each\r\n_puric_, or able-bodied man, had a right to his share of the crop,\r\nprovided that he had been present at the sowing. All those who were\r\nabsent must have been employed in the service of the Inca or Huaca, and\r\nsubsisted on the government or priestly share. Shepherds and mechanics\r\nwere also dependent on those shares. Officers called _Runay-pachaca_\r\nannually revised the allotments, made the census, prepared statistics\r\nfor the _Quipu-camayoc_, and sent reports to the _Tucuyricoc_. The\r\n_Llacta-camayoc_, or village overseer, announced the turns for\r\nirrigation and the fields to be cultivated when the shares were grown\r\napart. These daily notices were usually given from a tower or terrace.\r\nThere were also judges or examiners, called _Taripasac_,[1215] who\r\ninvestigated serious offences and settled disputes. Punishments for\r\ncrimes were severe, and inexorably inflicted. It was also the duty of\r\nthese officers, when a particular _ayllu_ suffered any calamity through\r\nwars or natural causes, to allot contingents from surrounding _ayllus_\r\nto assist the neighbor in distress. There were similar arrangements\r\nwhen the completion or repair of any public work was urgent. The most\r\ncruel tax on the people consisted in the selection of the _Aclla-cuna_,\r\nor chosen maidens for the service of the Inca, and the church, or\r\n_Huaca_. This was done once a year by an ecclesiastical dignitary\r\ncalled the _Apu-Panaca_,[1216] or, according to one authority, the\r\n_Hatun-uilca_,[1217] who was deputy of the high-priest. Service under\r\nthe Inca in all other capacities was eagerly sought for.\r\n\r\nThe industry and skill of the Peruvian husbandmen can scarcely\r\nalone account for the perfection to which they brought the science\r\nof agriculture. The administrative system of the Incas must share\r\nthe credit. Not a spot of cultivable land was neglected. Towns and\r\nvillages were built on rocky ground. Even their dead were buried in\r\nwaste places. Dry wastes were irrigated, and terraces were constructed,\r\nsometimes a hundred deep, up the sides of the mountains. The most\r\nbeautiful example of this terrace cultivation may still be seen in the\r\n“Andeneria,” or hanging gardens of the valley of Vilcamayu, near Cuzco.\r\nThere the terraces, commencing with broad fields at the edge of the\r\nlevel ground, rise to a height of 1,500 feet, narrowing as they rise,\r\nuntil the loftiest terraces against the perpendicular mountain side are\r\nnot more than two feet wide, just room for three or four rows of maize.\r\nAn irrigation canal, starting high up some narrow ravine at the snow\r\nlevel, is carried along the mountain side and through the terraces,\r\nflowing down from one to another.\r\n\r\nIrrigation on a larger scale was employed not only on the desert coast,\r\nbut to water the pastures and arable lands in the mountains, where\r\nthere is rain for several months in the year. The channels were often\r\nof considerable size and great length. Mr. Squier says that he has\r\nfollowed them for days together, winding amidst the projections of\r\nhills, here sustained by high masonry walls, there cut into the living\r\nrock, and in some places conducted in tunnels through sharp spurs of an\r\nobstructing mountain. An officer knew the space of time necessary for\r\nirrigating each _tupu_, and each cultivator received a flow of water in\r\naccordance with the requirements of his land. The manuring of crops was\r\nalso carefully attended to.[1218]\r\n\r\nThe result of all this intelligent labor was fully commensurate with\r\nthe thought and skill expended. The Incas produced the finest potato\r\ncrops the world has ever seen. The white maize of Cuzco has never\r\nbeen approached in size or in yield. Coca, now so highly prized, is\r\na product peculiar to Inca agriculture, and its cultivation required\r\nextreme care, especially in the picking and drying processes. Ajï, or\r\nChile pepper, furnished a new condiment to the Old World. Peruvian\r\ncotton is excelled only by Sea Island and Egyptian in length of fibre,\r\nand for strength and length of fibre combined is without an equal.\r\nQuinua, oca, aracacha, and several fruits are also peculiar to Peruvian\r\nagriculture.[1219]\r\n\r\nThe vast flocks of llamas[1220] and alpacas supplied meat for\r\nthe people, dried _charqui_ for soldiers and travellers, and wool\r\nfor weaving cloth of every degree of fineness. The alpacas, whose\r\nunrivalled wool is now in such large demand, may almost be said to have\r\nbeen the creation of the Inca shepherds. They can only be reared by\r\nthe bestowal on them of the most constant and devoted care. The wild\r\n_huanacus_ and _vicuñas_ were also sources of food and wool supply.\r\nNo man was allowed to kill any wild animal in Peru, but there were\r\nperiodical hunts, called _chacu_, in the different provinces, which\r\nwere ordered by the Inca. On these occasions a wide area was surrounded\r\nby thousands of people, who gradually closed in towards the centre.\r\nThey advanced, shouting and starting the game before them, and closed\r\nin, forming in several ranks until a great bag was secured. The females\r\nwere released, with a few of the best and finest males. The rest were\r\nthen shorn and also released, a certain proportion being killed for the\r\nsake of their flesh. The _huanacu_ wool was divided among the people\r\nof the district, while the silky fleeces of the _vicuña_ were reserved\r\nfor the Inca. The _Quipu-camayoc_ kept a careful record of the number\r\ncaught, shorn, and killed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM HELPS.\r\n\r\n[Cf. Humboldt’s account in _Views of Nature_, English transl., 393-95,\r\n407-9, 412. Marcoy says the usual descriptions of the ancient roads are\r\nexaggerations (vol. i. 206).—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe means of communication in so mountainous a country were an\r\nimportant department in the administration of the Incas. Excellent\r\nroads for foot passengers radiated from Cuzco to the remotest portions\r\nof the empire. The Inca roads were level and well paved, and continued\r\nfor hundreds of leagues. Rocks were broken up and levelled when it\r\nwas necessary, ravines were filled, and excavations were made in\r\nmountain sides. Velasco measured the width of the Inca roads, and found\r\nthem to be from six to seven yards, sufficiently wide when only foot\r\npassengers used them. Gomara gives them a breadth of twenty-five feet,\r\nand says that they were paved with smooth stones. These measurements\r\nwere confirmed by Humboldt as regards the roads in the Andes. The\r\nroad along the coast was forty feet wide, according to Zarate. The\r\nInca himself travelled in a litter, borne by mountaineers from the\r\ndistricts of Soras and Lucanas. _Corpa-huasi_, or rest-houses, were\r\nerected at intervals, and the government messengers, or _chasquis_, ran\r\nwith wonderful celerity from one of these stations to another, where\r\nhe delivered his message, or _quipu_, to the next runner. Thus news\r\nwas brought to the central government from all parts of The empire\r\nwith extraordinary rapidity, and the Inca ate fresh fish at Cuzco\r\nwhich had been caught in the Pacific, three hundred miles away, on the\r\nprevious day. Store-houses, with arms, clothing, and provisions for the\r\nsoldiers, were also built at intervals along the roads, so that an army\r\ncould be concentrated at any point without previous preparation.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the facilities for communication, which were so\r\nadmirably established by the Incas, was the system of moving colonies\r\nfrom one part of the empire to another. The evils of minute subdivision\r\nwere thus avoided, political objects were often secured, and the\r\ncomfort of the people was increased by the exchange of products. The\r\ncolonists were called _mitimaes_. For example, the people of the\r\nCollao, round Lake Titicaca, lived in a region where corn would not\r\nripen, and if confined to the products of their native land they must\r\nhave subsisted solely on potatoes, quinua, and llama flesh. But the\r\nIncas established colonies from their villages in the coast valleys\r\nof Tacna and Moquegua, and in the forests to the eastward. There was\r\nconstant intercourse, and while the mother country supplied _chuñus_ or\r\npreserved potatoes, _charqui_ or dried meat, and wool to the colonists,\r\nthere came back in return, corn and fruits and cotton cloth from the\r\ncoast, and the beloved coca from the forests.\r\n\r\nMilitary colonies were also established on the frontiers, and the\r\narmies of the Incas, in their marches and extensive travels, promoted\r\nthe circulation of knowledge, while this service also gave employment\r\nto the surplus agricultural population. Soldiers were brought from all\r\nparts of the empire, and each tribe or _ayllu_ was distinguished by its\r\narms, but more especially by its head-dress. The Inca wore the crimson\r\n_llautu_, or fringe; the _Apu_, or general, wore a yellow _llautu_. One\r\ntribe wore a puma’s head; the Cañaris were adorned with the feathers\r\nof macaws, the Huacrachucus with the horns of deer, the Pocras and\r\nHuamanchucus with a falcon’s wing feathers. The arms of the Incas and\r\nChancas consisted of a copper axe, called _champi_; a lance pointed\r\nwith bronze, called _chuqui_; and a pole with a bronze or stone head\r\nin the shape of a six-pointed star, used as a club, called _macana_.\r\nThe Collas and Quichuas came with slings and _bolas_, the _Antis_ with\r\nbows and arrows. Defensive armor consisted of a _hualcanca_ or shield,\r\nthe _umachucu_ or head-dress, and sometimes a breastplate. The perfect\r\norder prevailing in civil life was part of the same system which\r\nenforced strict discipline in the army; and ultimately the Inca troops\r\nwere irresistible against any enemy that could bring an opposing force\r\ninto the field. Only when the Incas fought against each other, as in\r\nthe last civil war, could the result be long doubtful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERUVIAN METAL WORKERS.\r\n\r\n[Reproduction of a cut in Benzoni’s _Historia del Mondo Nuovo_\r\n(1565).

The artists who\r\nfashioned the stones of the Sillustani towers or of the Cuzco temple\r\nwith scientific accuracy before they were fixed in their places, were\r\nwholly devoted to their art. Food and clothing had to be provided for\r\nthem, and for the miners, weavers, and potters. Gold was obtained by\r\nthe Incas in immense quantities by washing the sands of the rivers\r\nwhich flowed through the forest-covered province of Caravaya. Silver\r\nwas extracted from the ore by means of blasting-furnaces called\r\n_huayra_; for, although quicksilver was known and used as a coloring\r\nmaterial, its properties for refining silver do not appear to have\r\nbeen discovered. Copper was abundant in the Collao and in Charcas, and\r\ntin was found in the hills on the east side of Lake Titicaca, which\r\nenabled the Peruvians to use bronze very extensively.[1221] Lead was\r\nalso known to them. Skilful workers in metals fashioned the vases and\r\nother utensils for the use of the Inca and of the temples, forged the\r\narms of the soldiers and the implements of husbandry, and stamped or\r\nchased the ceremonial breastplates, _topus_, girdles, and chains. The\r\nbronze and copper warlike instruments, which were star-shaped and used\r\nas clubs, fixed at the ends of staves, were cast in moulds. One of\r\nthese club-heads, now in the Cambridge collection, has six rays, broad\r\nand flat, and terminating in rounded points. Each ray represents a\r\nhuman head, the face on one surface and the hair and back of the head\r\non the other. This specimen was undoubtedly cast in a mould. “It is,”\r\nsays Professor Putnam, “a good illustration of the knowledge which\r\nthe ancient Peruvians had of the methods of working metals and of the\r\ndifficult art of casting copper.”[1222]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNFINISHED CLOTH FOUND AT PACHACAMAC.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in Wiener, _Pérou et Bolivie_, p. 65.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nSpinning, weaving, and dyeing were arts which were sources of\r\nemployment to a great number of people, owing to the quantity and\r\nvariety of the fabrics for which there was a demand. There were rich\r\ndresses interwoven with gold or made of gold thread; fine woollen\r\nmantles, or tunics, ornamented with borders of small square gold and\r\nsilver plates; colored cotton cloths worked in complicated patterns;\r\nand fabrics of aloe fibre and sheeps’ sinews for breeches. Coarser\r\ncloths of llama wool were also made in vast quantities. But the potters\r\nart was perhaps the one which exercised the inventive faculties of the\r\nPeruvian artist to the greatest extent. The silver and gold utensils,\r\nwith the exception of a very few cups and vases, have nearly all been\r\nmelted down. But specimens of pottery, found buried with the dead in\r\ngreat profusion, are abundant. They are to be seen in every museum, and\r\nat Berlin and Madrid the collections are very large.[1223] Varied as\r\nare the forms to be found in the pottery of the Incas, and elegant as\r\nare many of the designs, it must be acknowledged that they are inferior\r\nin these respects to the specimens of the plastic art of the Chimu and\r\nother people of the Peruvian coast. The Incas, however, displayed a\r\nconsiderable play of fancy in their designs. Many of the vases were\r\nmoulded into forms to represent animals, fruit, and corn, and were used\r\nas _conopas_, or household gods. Others took the shape of human heads\r\nor feet, or were made double or quadruple, with a single neck branching\r\nfrom below. Some were for interment with the _malquis_, others for\r\nhousehold use.[1224] Professor Wilson, who carefully examined several\r\ncollections of ancient Peruvian pottery, formed a high opinion of their\r\nmerit. “Some of the specimens,” he wrote, “are purposely grotesque,\r\nand by no means devoid of true comic fancy; while, in the greater\r\nnumber, the endless variety of combinations of animate and inanimate\r\nforms, ingeniously rendered subservient to the requirements of utility,\r\nexhibit fertility of thought in the designer, and a lively perceptive\r\nfaculty in those for whom he wrought.”[1225]\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal more to learn respecting this marvellous\r\nInca civilization. Recent publications have, within the last few\r\nyears, thrown fresh and unexpected light upon it. There may be more\r\ninformation still undiscovered or inedited. As yet we can understand\r\nthe wonderful story only imperfectly, and see it by doubtful lights.\r\nRespecting some questions, even of the first importance, we are still\r\nable only to make guesses and weigh probabilities. Yet, though there\r\nis much that is uncertain as regards historical and other points, we\r\nhave before us the clear general outlines of a very extraordinary\r\npicture. In no other part of America had civilization attained to such\r\na height among indigenous races. In no other part of the world has the\r\nadministration of a purely socialistic government been attempted. The\r\nIncas not only made the attempt, but succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.\r\n\r\nTHE student of Inca civilization will first seek for information\r\nfrom those Spanish writers who lived during or immediately after\r\nthe Spanish conquest. They were able to converse with natives who\r\nactually flourished before the disruption of the Inca empire, and who\r\nsaw the working of the Inca system before the destruction and ruin\r\nhad well commenced. He will next turn to those laborious inquirers\r\nand commentators who, although not living so near the time, were\r\nable to collect traditions and other information from natives who\r\nhad carefully preserved all that had been handed down by their\r\nfathers.[1226] These two classes include the writers of the sixteenth\r\nand seventeenth centuries. The authors who have occupied themselves\r\nwith the Quichua language and the literature of the Incas have produced\r\nworks a knowledge of which is essential to an adequate study of the\r\nsubject.[1227] Lastly, a consideration of the publications of modern\r\ntravellers and scholars, who throw light on the writings of early\r\nchroniclers, or describe the present appearance of ancient remains,\r\nwill show the existing position of a survey still far from complete,\r\nand the interest and charm of which invite further investigation and\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nForemost in the first class of writers on Peru is Pedro de Cieza de\r\nLeon. A general account of his works will be found elsewhere,[1228]\r\nand the present notice will therefore be confined to an estimate of\r\nthe labors of this author, so far as they relate to Inca history and\r\ncivilization. Cieza de Leon conceived the desire to write an account\r\nof the strange things that were to be seen in the New World, at an\r\nearly period of his service as a soldier. “Neither fatigue,” he tells\r\nus, “nor the ruggedness of the country, nor the mountains and rivers,\r\nnor intolerable hunger and suffering, have ever been sufficient to\r\nobstruct my two duties, namely, writing and following my flag and my\r\ncaptain without fault.” He finished the First Part of his chronicle\r\nin September, 1550, when he was thirty-two years of age. It is mainly\r\na geographical description of the country, containing many pieces of\r\ninformation, such as the account of the Inca roads and bridges, which\r\nare of great value. But it is to the Second Part that we owe much of\r\nour knowledge of Inca civilization. From incidental notices we learn\r\nhow diligently young Cieza de Leon studied the history and government\r\nof the Incas, after he had written his picturesque description of the\r\ncountry in his First Part. He often asked the Indians what they knew of\r\ntheir condition before the Incas became their lords. He inquired into\r\nthe traditions of the people from the chiefs of the villages. In 1550\r\nhe went to Cuzco with the express purpose of collecting information,\r\nand conferred diligently with one of the surviving descendants of the\r\nInca Huayna Ccapac. Cieza de Leon’s plan, for the second part of his\r\nwork, was first to review the system of government of the Incas, and\r\nthen to narrate the events of the reign of each sovereign. He spared\r\nno pains to obtain the best and most authentic information, and his\r\nsympathy with the conquered people, and generous appreciation of their\r\nmany good and noble qualities, give a special charm to his narrative.\r\nHe bears striking evidence to the historical faculty possessed by the\r\nlearned men at the court of the Incas. After saying that on the death\r\nof a sovereign the chroniclers related the events of his reign to his\r\nsuccessor, he adds: “They could well do this, for there were among\r\nthem some men with good memories, sound judgments, and subtle genius,\r\nand full of reasoning power, as we can bear witness who have heard\r\nthem even in these our days.” Cieza de Leon is certainly one of the\r\nmost important authorities on Inca history and civilization, whether\r\nwe consider his peculiar advantages, his diligence and ability, or his\r\ncharacter as a conscientious historian.\r\n\r\nJuan José de Betanzos, like Cieza de Leon, was one of the soldiers of\r\nthe conquest. He married a daughter of Atahualpa, and became a citizen\r\nat Cuzco, where he devoted his time to the study of Quichua. He was\r\nappointed official interpreter to the Audience and to successive\r\nviceroys, and he wrote a _Doctrina_ and two vocabularies which are\r\nnow lost. In 1558 he was appointed by the viceroy Marquis of Cañete,\r\nto treat with the Inca Sayri Tupac,[1229] who had taken refuge in the\r\nfastness of Vilcabamba; and by the Governor Lope Garcia de Castro, to\r\nconduct a similar negotiation with Titu Cusi Yupanqui, the brother\r\nof Sayri Tupac. He was successful in both missions. He wrote his\r\nmost valuable work, the _Suma y Narracion de los Incas_, which was\r\nfinished in the year 1551, by order of the Viceroy Don Antonio de\r\nMendoza, but its publication was prevented by the death of the viceroy.\r\nIt remained in manuscript, and its existence was first made known\r\nby the Dominican monk Gregorio Garcia in 1607, whose own work will\r\nbe referred to presently. Garcia said that the history of Betanzos\r\nrelating to the origin, descent, succession, and wars of the Incas was\r\nin his possession, and had been of great use to him. Leon Pinelo and\r\nAntonio also gave brief notices of the manuscript, but it is only twice\r\ncited by Prescott. The great historian probably obtained a copy of a\r\nmanuscript in the Escurial, through Obadiah Rich. This manuscript is\r\nbound up with the second part of Cieza de Leon. It is not, however,\r\nthe whole work which Garcia appears to have possessed, but only the\r\nfirst eighteen chapters, and the last incomplete. Such as it is, it was\r\nedited and printed for the _Biblioteca Hispano-Ultramarina_, by Don\r\nMárcos Jiménez de la Espada, in 1880.[1230]\r\n\r\nThe work of Betanzos differs from that of Cieza de Leon, because\r\nwhile the latter displays a diligence and discretion in collecting\r\ninformation which give it great weight as an authority, the former\r\nis imbued with the very spirit of the natives. The narrative of the\r\npreparation of young Yupanqui for the death-struggle with the Chancas\r\nis life-like in its picturesque vigor. Betanzos has portrayed native\r\nfeeling and character as no other Spaniard has, or probably could have\r\ndone. Married to an Inca princess, and intimately conversant with the\r\nlanguage, this most scholarly of the conquerors is only second to Cieza\r\nde Leon as an authority. The date of his death is unknown.\r\n\r\nBetanzos and Cieza de Leon, with Pedro Pizarro, are the writers among\r\nthe conquerors whose works have been preserved. But these three\r\nmartial scholars by no means stand alone among their comrades as\r\nauthors. Several other companions of Pizarro wrote narratives, which\r\nunfortunately have been lost.[1231] It is indeed surprising that the\r\ndesire to record some account of the native civilization they had\r\ndiscovered should have been so prevalent among the conquerors. The fact\r\nscarcely justifies the term “rude soldiery,” which is so often applied\r\nto the discoverers of Peru.\r\n\r\nThe works of the soldier conquerors are certainly not less valuable\r\nthan those of the lawyers and priests who followed on their heels. Yet\r\nthese latter treat the subject from somewhat different points of view,\r\nand thus furnish supplemental information. The works of four lawyers\r\nof the era of the conquest have been preserved, and those of another\r\nare lost. Of these, the writings of the Licentiate Polo de Ondegardo\r\nare undoubtedly the most important. This learned jurist accompanied\r\nthe president, La Gasca, in his campaign against Gonzalo Pizarro,\r\nhaving arrived in Peru a few years previously, and he subsequently\r\noccupied the post of corregidor at Cuzco. Serving under the Viceroy\r\nDon Francisco de Toledo, he was constantly consulted by that acute but\r\nnarrow-minded statesman. His duties thus led Polo de Ondegardo to make\r\ndiligent researches into the laws and administration of the Incas, with\r\na view to the adoption of all that was applicable to the new régime.\r\nBut his knowledge of the language was limited, and it is necessary to\r\nreceive many of his statements with caution. His two _Relaciones_,\r\nthe first dedicated to the Viceroy Marques de Cañete (1561), and the\r\nsecond finished in 1570,[1232] are in the form of answers to questions\r\non financial revenue and other administrative points. They include\r\ninformation respecting the social customs, religious rites, and laws of\r\nthe Incas. These _Relaciones_ are still in manuscript. Another report\r\nby Polo de Ondegardo exists in the National Library at Madrid,[1233]\r\nand has been translated into English for the Hakluyt Society.[1234] In\r\nthis treatise the learned corregidor describes the principles on which\r\nthe Inca conquests were made, the division and tenures of land, the\r\nsystem of tribute, the regulations for preserving game and for forest\r\nconservancy, and the administrative details. Here and there he points\r\nout a way in which the legislation of the Incas might be imitated and\r\nutilized by their conquerors.[1235]\r\n\r\nAgustin de Zarate, though a lawyer by profession, had been employed for\r\nsome years in the financial department of the Spanish government before\r\nhe went out to Peru with the Viceroy Blasco Nuñez to examine into the\r\naccounts of the colony. On his return to Spain he was entrusted with\r\na similar mission in Flanders. His _Provincìa del Peru_ was first\r\npublished at Antwerp in 1555.[1236] Unacquainted with the native\r\nlanguages, and ignorant of the true significance of much that he was\r\ntold, Zarate was yet a shrewd observer, and his evidence is valuable as\r\nregards what came under his own immediate observation. He gives one of\r\nthe best descriptions of the Inca roads.\r\n\r\nThe _Relacion_ of Fernando de Santillan is a work which may be classed\r\nwith the reports of Polo de Ondegardo, and its author had equal\r\nadvantages in collecting information. Going out to Peru as one of\r\nthe judges of the Audiencia in 1550,[1237] Santillan was for a short\r\ntime at the head of the government, after the death of the Viceroy\r\nMendoza, and he took the field to suppress the rebellion of Giron. He\r\nafterwards served in Chile and at Quito, where he was commissioned to\r\nestablish the court of justice. Returning to Spain, he took orders,\r\nand was appointed Bishop of the La Plata, but died at Lima, on his\r\nway to his distant see, in 1576. The _Relacion_ of Santillan remained\r\nin manuscript, in the library of the Escurial, until it was edited by\r\nDon Márcos Jiménez de la Espada in 1879. This report appears to have\r\nbeen prepared in obedience to a decree desiring the judges of Lima to\r\nexamine aged and learned Indians regarding the administrative system of\r\nthe Incas. The report of Santillan is mainly devoted to a discussion of\r\nthe laws and customs relating to the collection of tribute. He bears\r\ntestimony to the excellence of the Inca government, and to the wretched\r\ncondition to which the country had since been reduced by Spanish\r\nmisrule.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Licentiate Juan de Matienzo, a contemporary of\r\nOndegardo, entitled _Gobierno de el Peru_, is still in manuscript. Like\r\nSantillan and Ondegardo, Matienzo discusses the ancient institutions\r\nwith a view to the organization of the best possible system under\r\nSpanish rule.[1238]\r\n\r\nMelchor Bravo de Saravia, another judge of the Royal Audience at Lima,\r\nand a contemporary of Santillan, is said to have written a work on the\r\nantiquities of Peru; but it is either lost or has not yet been placed\r\nwithin reach of the student. It is referred to by Velasco. Cieza de\r\nLeon mentions, at the end of his Second Part, that his own work had\r\nbeen perused by the learned judges Hernando de Santillan and Bravo de\r\nSaravia.\r\n\r\nWhile the lawyers turned their attention chiefly to the civil\r\nadministration of the conquered people, the priests naturally studied\r\nthe religious beliefs and languages of the various tribes, and\r\ncollected their historical traditions. The best and most accomplished\r\nof these sacerdotal authors appears to have been Blas Valera, judging\r\nfrom the fragments of his writings which have escaped destruction. He\r\nwas a native of Peru, born at Chachapoyas in 1551, where his father,\r\nLuis Valera,[1239] one of the early conquerors, had settled. Young Blas\r\nwas received into the Company of Jesus at Lima when only seventeen\r\nyears of age, and, as he was of Inca race on the mother’s side, he\r\nsoon became useful at the College in Cuzco from his proficiency in the\r\nnative languages. He did missionary work in the surrounding villages,\r\nand acquired a profound knowledge of the history and institutions of\r\nthe Incas. Eventually he completed a work on the subject in Latin,\r\nand was sent to Spain by his Jesuit superiors with a view to its\r\npublication. Unfortunately the greater part of his manuscript was burnt\r\nat the sack of Cadiz by the Earl of Essex in 1596, and Blas Valera\r\nhimself died shortly afterwards. The fragments that were rescued fell\r\ninto the hands of Garcilasso de la Vega, who translated them into\r\nSpanish, and printed them in his _Commentaries_. It is to Blas Valera\r\nthat we owe the preservation of two specimens of Inca poetry and an\r\nestimate of Inca chronology. He has also recorded the traditional\r\nsayings of several Inca sovereigns, and among his fragments there are\r\nvery interesting chapters on the religion, the laws and ordinances, and\r\nthe language of the Incas, and on the vegetable products and medicinal\r\ndrugs of Peru. These fragments are evidence that Blas Valera was an\r\nelegant scholar, a keen observer, and thoroughly master of his subject.\r\nThey enhance the feeling of regret at the irreparable loss that we have\r\nsustained by the destruction of the rest of his work.\r\n\r\nNext to Blas Valera, the most important authority on Inca civilization,\r\namong the Spanish priests who were in Peru during the sixteenth\r\ncentury, is undoubtedly Christoval de Molina. He was chaplain to the\r\nhospital for natives at Cuzco, and his work was written between 1570\r\nand 1584, the period embraced by the episcopate of Dr. Sebastian de\r\nArtaun, to whom it is dedicated. Molina gives minute and detailed\r\naccounts of the ceremonies performed at all the religious festivals\r\nthroughout the year, with the prayers used by the priests on each\r\noccasion. Out of the fourteen prayers preserved by Molina, four are\r\naddressed to the Supreme Being, two to the sun, the rest to these\r\nand other deities combined. His mastery of the Quichua language, his\r\nintimacy with the native chiefs and learned men, and his long residence\r\nat Cuzco give Molina a very high place as an authority on Inca\r\ncivilization. His work has remained in manuscript,[1240] but it has\r\nbeen translated into English and printed for the Hakluyt Society.[1241]\r\n\r\nMolina, in his dedicatory address to Bishop Artaun, mentions a\r\nprevious narrative which he had submitted, on the origin, history, and\r\ngovernment of the Incas. Fortunately this account was preserved by\r\nMiguel Cavello Balboa, an author who wrote at Quito between 1576 and\r\n1586. Balboa, a soldier who had taken orders late in life, went out\r\nto America in 1566, and settled at Quito, where he devoted himself to\r\nthe preparation and writing of a work which he entitled _Miscellanea\r\nAustral_. It is in three parts; but only the third, comprising about\r\nhalf the work, relates to Peru. Balboa tells us that his authority for\r\nthe early Inca traditions and history was the learned Christoval de\r\nMolina, and this gives special value to Balboa’s work. Moreover, Balboa\r\nis the only authority who gives any account of the origin of the coast\r\npeople, and he also supplies a detailed narrative of the war between\r\nHuascar and Atahualpa. The portion relating to Peru was translated into\r\nFrench and published by Ternaux Compans in 1840.[1242]\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits who arrived in Peru during the latter part of the\r\nsixteenth century were devoted to missionary labors, and gave an\r\nimpetus to the study of the native languages and history. Among the\r\nmost learned was José de Acosta, who sailed for Peru in 1570. At the\r\nearly age of thirty-five, Acosta was chosen to be Provincial of the\r\nJesuits in Peru, and his duties required him to travel over every part\r\nof the country. His great learning, which is displayed in his various\r\ntheological works, qualified him for the task of writing his _Natural\r\nand Moral History of the Indies_, the value of which is increased\r\nby the author’s personal acquaintance with the countries and their\r\ninhabitants. Acosta went home in the Spanish fleet of 1587, and his\r\nfirst care, on his return to Spain, was to make arrangements for the\r\npublication of his manuscripts. The results of his South American\r\nresearches first saw the light at Salamanca, in Latin, in 1588 and\r\n1589. The complete work in Spanish, _Historia Natural y Moral de las\r\nIndias_, was published at Seville in 1590. Its success was never\r\ndoubtful.[1243] In his latter years Acosta presided over the Jesuits’\r\nCollege at Salamanca, where he died in his sixtieth year, on February\r\n15, 1600.[1244] In spite of the learning and diligence of Acosta and of\r\nthe great popularity of his work, it cannot be considered one of the\r\nmost valuable contributions towards a knowledge of Inca civilization.\r\nThe information it contains is often inaccurate, the details are\r\nless complete than in most of the other works written soon after the\r\nconquest,[1245] and a want of knowledge of the language is frequently\r\nmade apparent. The best chapters are those devoted to the animal and\r\nvegetable products of Peru; and Feyjoo calls Acosta the Pliny of the\r\nNew World.[1246]\r\n\r\nThe Licentiate Fernando Montesinos, a native of Osuna, was one of the\r\nmost diligent of all those who in early times made researches into the\r\nhistory and traditions of the Incas. Montesinos went out in the fleet\r\nwhich took the Viceroy Count of Chinchon to Peru, arriving early in\r\nthe year 1629. Having landed at Payta, Montesinos travelled southwards\r\ntowards the capital until he reached the city of Truxillo. At that\r\ntime Dr. Carlos Marcelino Corni was Bishop of Truxillo.[1247] Hearing\r\nof the virtue and learning of Montesinos, Dr. Corni begged that he\r\nmight be allowed to stop at Truxillo, and take charge of the Jesuits’\r\nCollege which the good bishop had established there. Montesinos\r\nremained at Truxillo until the death of Bishop Corni, in October,\r\n1629,[1248] and then proceeded to Potosi, where he gave his attention\r\nto improvements in the methods of extracting silver. He wrote a book\r\non the subject, which was printed at Lima, and also compiled a code\r\nof ordinances for mines with a view to lessening disputes, which was\r\nofficially approved. Returning to the capital, he lived for several\r\nyears at Lima as chaplain of one of the smaller churches, and devoted\r\nall his energies to the preparation of a history of Peru. Making Lima\r\nhis headquarters, the indefatigable student undertook excursions into\r\nall parts of the country, wherever he heard of learned natives to be\r\nconsulted, of historical documents to be copied, or of information to\r\nbe found. He travelled over 1,500 leagues, from Quito to Potosi. In\r\n1639 he was employed to write an account of the famous Auto de Fé which\r\nwas celebrated at Lima in that year. His two great historical works\r\nare entitled _Memorias Antiguas Historiales del Peru_, and _Anales ó\r\nMemorias Nuevas del Peru_.[1249] From Lima Montesinos proceeded to\r\nQuito as “Visitador General,” with very full powers conferred by the\r\nbishop.\r\n\r\nThe work of Montesinos remained in manuscript until it was translated\r\ninto French by M. Ternaux Compans in 1840, with the title _Mémoires\r\nHistoriques sur l’ancien Pérou_. In 1882 the Spanish text was very\r\nably edited by Don Márcos Jiménez de la Espada.[1250] Montesinos gives\r\nthe history of several dynasties which preceded the rise of the Incas,\r\nenumerating upwards of a hundred sovereigns. He professes to have\r\nacquired a knowledge of the ancient records through the interpretations\r\nof the _quipus_, communicated to him by learned natives. It was long\r\nsupposed that the accounts of these earlier sovereigns received no\r\ncorroboration from any other authority. This furnished legitimate\r\ngrounds for discrediting Montesinos. But a narrative, as old or older\r\nthan that of the licentiate, has recently been brought to light, in\r\nwhich at least two of the ancient sovereigns in the lists of Montesinos\r\nare incidentally referred to. This circumstance alters the aspect\r\nof the question, and places the _Memorias Antiquas del Peru_ in a\r\nhigher position as an authority; for it proves that the very ancient\r\ntraditions which Montesinos professed to have received from the natives\r\nhad previously been communicated to one other independent inquirer at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nThis independent inquirer is an author whose valuable work has\r\nrecently been edited by Don Márcos Jiménez de la Espada.[1251] His\r\nnarrative is anonymous, but internal evidence establishes the fact\r\nthat he was a Jesuit, and probably one of the first who arrived in\r\nPeru in 1568, although he appears to have written his work many years\r\nafterwards. The anonymous Jesuit supplies information respecting\r\nworks on Peruvian civilization which are lost to us. He describes the\r\ntemples, the orders of the priesthood, the sacrifices and religious\r\nceremonies, explaining the origin of the erroneous statement that human\r\nsacrifices were offered up. He also gives the code of criminal law and\r\nthe customs which prevailed in civil life, and concludes his work with\r\na short treatise on the conversion of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the viceroys and archbishops of Lima during the early\r\npart of the seventeenth century to extirpate idolatry, particularly\r\nin the province of Lima, led to the preparation of reports by the\r\npriests who were entrusted with the duty of extirpation, which\r\ncontain much curious information. These were the Fathers Hernando\r\nde Avendaño, Francisco de Avila, Luis de Teruel, and Pablo José de\r\nArriaga. Avendaño, in addition to his sermons in Quichua, wrote an\r\naccount of the idolatries of the Indians,—_Relacion de las Idolatrias\r\nde los Indios_,—which is still in manuscript. Avila was employed in\r\nthe province of Huarochiri, and in 1608 he wrote a report on the idols\r\nand superstitions of the people, including some exceedingly curious\r\nreligious legends. He appears to have written down the original\r\nevidence from the mouths of the Indians in Quichua, intending to\r\ntranslate it into Spanish. But he seems to have completed only six\r\nchapters in Spanish; or perhaps the translation is by another hand.\r\nThere are still thirty-one chapters in Quichua awaiting the labors\r\nof some learned Peruvian scholar. Rising Quichua students, of whom\r\nthere are not a few in Peru, could undertake no more useful work.\r\nThis important report of Avila is comprised in a manuscript volume\r\nin the National Library at Madrid, and the six Spanish chapters have\r\nbeen translated and printed for the Hakluyt Society.[1252] Teruel was\r\nthe friend and companion of Avila. He also wrote a treatise on native\r\nidolatries,[1253] and another against idolatry,[1254] in which he\r\ndiscusses the origin of the coast people. Arriaga wrote a still more\r\nvaluable work on the extirpation of idolatry, which was printed at Lima\r\nin 1621, and which relates the religious beliefs and practices of the\r\npeople in minute detail.[1255]\r\n\r\nAntiquarian treasures of great value are buried in the works of\r\necclesiastics, the principal objects of which are the record of the\r\ndeeds of one or other of the religious fraternities. The most important\r\nof these is the _Coronica Moralizada del orden de San Augustin en el\r\nPeru; del Padre Antonio de la Calancha_ (1638-1653),[1256] which is\r\na precious storehouse of details respecting the manners and customs\r\nof the Indians and the topography of the country. Calancha also gives\r\nthe most accurate Inca calendar. Of less value is the chronicle of the\r\nFranciscans, by Diego de Cordova y Salinas, published at Madrid in 1643.\r\n\r\nA work, the title of which gives even less promise of containing\r\nprofitable information, is the history of the miraculous image of a\r\nvirgin at Copacabana, by Fray Alonso Ramos Gavilan. Yet it throws\r\nunexpected light on the movements of the _mitimaes_, or Inca colonists;\r\nit gives fresh details respecting the consecrated virgins, the\r\nsacrifices, and the deities worshipped in the Collao, and supplies\r\nanother version of the Inca calendar.[1257]\r\n\r\nThe work on the origin of the Indians of the New World, by Fray\r\nGregorio Garcia,[1258] who travelled extensively in the Spanish\r\ncolonies, is valuable, and to Garcia we owe the first notice of the\r\npriceless narrative of Betanzos. His separate work on the Incas is lost\r\nto us.[1259] Friar Martin de Múrua, a native of Guernica, in Biscay,\r\nwas an ecclesiastic of some eminence in Peru. He wrote a general\r\nhistory of the Incas, which was copied by Dr. Muñoz for his collection,\r\nand Leon Pinelo says that the manuscript was illustrated with colored\r\ndrawings of insignia and dresses, and portraits of the Incas.[1260]\r\n\r\nThe principal writers on Inca civilization in the century immediately\r\nsucceeding the conquest, of the three different professions,—soldiers,\r\nlawyers, and priests,—have now been passed in review. Attention must\r\nnext be given to the native writers who followed in the wake of Blas\r\nValera. First among these is the Inca Garcilasso de la Vega, an author\r\nwhose name is probably better known to the general reader than that\r\nof any other who has written on the same subject. Among the Spanish\r\nconquerors who arrived in Peru in 1534 was Garcilasso de la Vega, a\r\ncavalier of very noble lineage,[1261] who settled at Cuzco, and was\r\nmarried to an Inca princess named Chimpa Ocllo, niece of the Inca\r\nHuayna Ccapac. Their son, the future historian, was born at Cuzco in\r\n1539, and his earliest recollections were connected with the stirring\r\nevents of the civil war between Gonzalo Pizarro and the president La\r\nGasca, in 1548. His mother died soon afterwards, probably in 1550,\r\nand his father married again. The boy was much in the society of his\r\nmother’s kindred, and he often heard them talk over the times of the\r\nIncas, and repeat their historical traditions. Nor was his education\r\nneglected; for the good Canon Juan de Cuellar read Latin with the\r\nhalf-caste sons of the citizens of Cuzco for nearly two years, amidst\r\nall the turmoil of the civil wars. As he grew up, he was employed by\r\nhis father to visit his estates, and he travelled over most parts of\r\nPeru. The elder Garcilasso de la Vega died in 1560, and the young\r\norphan resolved to seek his fortune in the land of his fathers. On his\r\narrival in Spain he received patronage and kindness from his paternal\r\nrelatives, became a captain in the army of Philip II, and when he\r\nretired, late in life, he took up his abode in lodgings at Cordova,\r\nand devoted himself to literary pursuits. His first production was a\r\ntranslation from the Italian of “The Dialogues of Love,” and in 1591\r\nhe completed his narrative of the expedition of Hernando de Soto to\r\nFlorida.[1262]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOUSE IN CUZCO IN WHICH GARCILASSO WAS BORN.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in Marcoy, i. 219. Cf. Squier’s _Peru_, p. 449.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nAs years rolled on, the Inca began to think more and more of the land\r\nof his birth. The memory of his boyish days, of the long evening chats\r\nwith his Inca relations, came back to him in his old age. He was as\r\nproud of his maternal descent from the mighty potentates of Peru as\r\nof the old Castilian connection on his father’s side. It would seem\r\nthat the appearance of several books on the subject of his native land\r\nfinally induced him to undertake a work in which, while recording\r\nits own reminiscences and the information he might collect, he could\r\nalso comment on the statements of other authors. Hence the title of\r\n_Commentaries_ which he gave to his work. Besides the fragments of the\r\nwritings of Blas Valera, which enrich the pages of Garcilasso, the\r\nInca quotes from Acosta, from Gomara, from Zarate, and from the First\r\nPart of Cieza de Leon.[1263] He was fortunate in getting possession of\r\nthe chapters of Blas Valera rescued from the sack of Cadiz. He also\r\nwrote to all his surviving schoolfellows for assistance, and received\r\nmany traditions and detailed replies on other subjects from them. Thus\r\nAlcobasa forwarded an account of the ruins at Tiahuanacu, and another\r\nfriend sent him the measurements of the great fortress at Cuzco.\r\n\r\nThe Inca Garcilasso de la Vega is, without doubt, the first authority\r\non the civilization of his ancestors; but it is necessary to consider\r\nhis qualifications and the exact value of his evidence. He had lived\r\nin Peru until his twentieth year; Quichua was his native language,\r\nand he had constantly heard the traditions of the Incas related and\r\ndiscussed by his mother’s relations. But when he began to write he had\r\nbeen separated from these associations for upwards of thirty years.\r\nHe received materials from Peru, enabling him to compose a connected\r\nhistorical narrative, which is not, however, very reliable. The true\r\nvalue of his work is derived from his own reminiscences, aroused by\r\nreading the books which are the subjects of his Commentary, and from\r\nhis correspondence with friends in Peru. His memory was excellent, as\r\nis often proved when he corrects the mistakes of Acosta and others\r\nwith diffidence, and is invariably right. He was not credulous, having\r\nregard to the age in which he lived; nor was he inclined to give the\r\nrein to his imagination. More than once we find him rejecting the\r\nfanciful etymologies of the authors whose works he criticises. His\r\nnarratives of the battles and conquests of the early Incas often become\r\ntedious, and of this he is himself aware. He therefore intersperses\r\nthem with more interesting chapters on the religious ceremonies, the\r\ndomestic habits and customs, of the people, and on their advances in\r\npoetry, astronomy, music, medicine, and the arts. He often inserts\r\nan anecdote from the storehouse of his memory, or some personal\r\nreminiscence called forth by the subject on which he happens to be\r\nwriting. His statements frequently receive undesigned corroboration\r\nfrom authors whose works he never saw. Thus his curious account of the\r\nwater sacrifices, not mentioned by any other published authority, is\r\nverified by the full description of the same rite in the manuscript\r\nof Molina. On the other hand, the long absence of the Inca from his\r\nnative country entailed upon him grave disadvantages. His boyish\r\nrecollections, though deeply interesting, could not, from the nature of\r\nthe case, provide him with critical knowledge. Hence the mistakes in\r\nhis work are serious and of frequent occurrence. Dr. Villar has pointed\r\nout his total misconception of the Supreme Being of the Peruvians, and\r\nof the significance of the word “Uira-cocha.”[1264] But, with all its\r\nshortcomings,[1265] the work of the Inca Garcilasso de la Vega must\r\never be the main source of our knowledge, and without his pious labors\r\nthe story of the Incas would lose more than half its interest.\r\n\r\nThe first part of his _Commentarios Reales_, which alone concerns the\r\npresent subject, was published at Lisbon in 1607.[1266] The author died\r\nat Cordova at the age of seventy-six, and was buried in the cathedral\r\nin 1616. He lived just long enough to accomplish his most cherished\r\nwish, and to complete the work at which he had steadily and lovingly\r\nlabored for so many years.\r\n\r\nAnother Indian author wrote an account of the antiquities of Peru, at\r\na time when the grandchildren of those who witnessed the conquest by\r\nthe Spaniards were living. Unlike Garcilasso, this author never left\r\nthe land of his birth, but he was not of Inca lineage. Don Juan de\r\nSantacruz Pachacuti Yamqui Salcamayhua was a native of the Collao, and\r\ndescended from a family of local chiefs. His work is entitled _Relacion\r\nde Antigüedades deste Reyno del Peru_. It long remained in manuscript\r\nin the National Library at Madrid, until it was edited by Don Márcos\r\nJiménez de la Espada in 1879. It had previously been translated into\r\nEnglish and edited for the Hakluyt Society.[1267] Salcamayhua gives\r\nthe traditions of Inca history as they were handed down to the third\r\ngeneration after the conquest. Intimately acquainted with the language,\r\nand in a position to converse with the oldest recipients of native\r\nlore, he is able to record much that is untold elsewhere, and to\r\nconfirm a great deal that is related by former authors. He has also\r\npreserved two prayers in Quichua, attributed to Manco Ccapac, the first\r\nInca, and some others, which add to the number given by Molina. He also\r\ncorroborates the important statement of Molina, that the great gold\r\nplate in the temple at Cuzco was intended to represent the Supreme\r\nBeing, and not the sun. Salcamayhua is certainly a valuable addition to\r\nthe authorities on Peruvian history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration\r\n\r\nNOTE.—The title-page of the fifth decade Herrera, showing the\r\nInca portraits, is given above. Cf. the plate in Stevens’s English\r\ntranslation of Herrera, vol. iv., London, 1740, 2d edition.—ED.]\r\n\r\nWhile so many soldiers and priests and lawyers did their best to\r\npreserve a knowledge of Inca civilization, the Spanish government\r\nitself was not idle. The kings of Spain and their official advisers\r\nshowed an anxiety to prevent the destruction of monuments and to\r\ncollect historical and topographical information which is worthy of\r\nall praise. In 1585, orders were given to all the local authorities\r\nin Spanish America to transmit such information, and a circular,\r\ncontaining a series of interrogatories, was issued for their guidance.\r\nThe result of this measure was, that a great number of _Relaciones\r\ndescriptivas_ were received in Spain, and stored up in the archives of\r\nthe Indies. Herrera had these reports before him when he was writing\r\nhis history, but it is certain that he did not make use of half\r\nthe material they contain.[1268] Another very curious and valuable\r\nsource of information consists of the reports on the origin of Inca\r\nsovereignty, which were prepared by order of the Viceroy Don Francisco\r\nde Toledo, and forwarded to the council of the Indies. They consist\r\nof twenty documents, forming a large volume, and preceded by an\r\nintroductory letter. The viceroy’s object was to establish the fact\r\nthat the Incas had originally been usurpers, in forcibly acquiring\r\nauthority over the different provinces of the empire, and dispossessing\r\nthe native chiefs. His inference was, that, as usurpers, they were\r\nrightfully dethroned by the Spaniards. He failed to see that such an\r\nargument was equally fatal to a Spanish claim, based on anything but\r\nthe sword. Nevertheless, the traditions collected with this object,\r\nnot only from the Incas at Cuzco, but also from the chiefs of several\r\nprovinces, are very important and interesting.[1269]\r\n\r\nThe Viceroy Toledo also sent home four cloths on which the pedigree of\r\nthe Incas was represented. The figures of the successive sovereigns\r\nwere depicted, with medallions of their wives, and their respective\r\nlineages. The events of each reign were recorded on the borders,\r\nthe traditions of Paccari-tampu, and of the creation by Uira-cocha,\r\noccupying the first cloth. It is probable that the Inca portraits\r\ngiven by Herrera were copied from those on the cloths sent home\r\nby the viceroy. The head-dresses in Herrera are very like that of\r\nthe high-priest in the _Relacion_ of the anonymous Jesuit. A map\r\nseems to have accompanied the pedigree, which was drawn under the\r\nsuperintendence of the distinguished sailor and cosmographer, Don Pedro\r\nSarmiento de Gamboa.[1270]\r\n\r\nMuch curious information respecting the laws and customs of the\r\nIncas and the beliefs of the people is to be found in ordinances and\r\ndecrees of the Spanish authorities, both civil and ecclesiastical.\r\nThese ordinances are contained in the _Ordenanzas del Peru_, of the\r\nLicentiate Tomas de Ballesteros, in the _Politica Indiana_ of Juan de\r\nSolorzano (Madrid, 1649),[1271] in the _Concilium Limense_ of Acosta,\r\nand in the _Constituciones Synodales_ of Dr. Lobo Guerrero, Archbishop\r\nof Lima, printed in that city in 1614, and again in 1754.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Quito received attention from several early writers,\r\nbut most of their manuscripts are lost to us. Quito was fortunate,\r\nhowever, in finding a later historian to devote himself to the work\r\nof chronicling the story of his native land. Juan de Velasco was a\r\nnative of Riobamba. He resided for forty years in the kingdom of Quito\r\nas a Jesuit priest, he taught and preached in the native language of\r\nthe people, and he diligently studied all the works on the subject\r\nthat were accessible to him. He spent six years in travelling over\r\nthe country, twenty years in collecting books and manuscripts; and\r\nwhen the Jesuits were banished he took refuge in Italy, where he wrote\r\nhis _Historia del Reino de Quito_. Velasco used several authorities\r\nwhich are now lost. One of these was the _Conquista de la Provincia\r\ndel Quito_, by Fray Marco de Niza, a companion of Pizarro. Another was\r\nthe _Historia de las guerras civiles del Inca Atahualpa_, by Jacinto\r\nCollahuaso. He also refers to the _Antigüedades del Peru_ by Bravo\r\nde Saravia. As a native of Quito, Velasco is a strong partisan of\r\nAtahualpa; and he is the only historian who gives an account of the\r\ntraditions respecting the early kings of Quito. The work was completed\r\nin 1789, brought from Europe, and printed at Quito in 1844, and M.\r\nTernaux Compans brought out a French edition in 1840.[1272]\r\n\r\nRecent authors have written introductory essays on Peruvian\r\ncivilization to precede the story of the Spanish conquest, have\r\ndescribed the ruins in various parts of the country after personal\r\ninspection, or have devoted their labors to editing the early\r\nauthorities, or to bringing previously unknown manuscripts to light,\r\nand thus widening and strengthening the foundation on which future\r\nhistories may be raised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM ROBERTSON.\r\n\r\n[After a print in the _European Mag._ (1802), vol. xli.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nRobertson’s excellent view of the story of the Incas in his _History\r\nof America_[1273] was for many years the sole source of information on\r\nthe subject for the general English public; but since 1848 it has been\r\nsuperseded by Prescott’s charming narrative contained in the opening\r\nbook of his _Conquest of Peru_.[1274] The knowledge of the present\r\ngeneration on the subject of the Incas is derived almost entirely from\r\nPrescott, and, so far as it goes, there can be no better authority. But\r\nmuch has come to light since his time. Prescott’s narrative, occupying\r\n159 pages, is founded on the works of Garcilasso de la Vega, who is\r\nthe authority most frequently cited by him, Cieza de Leon, Ondegardo,\r\nand Acosta.[1275] Helps, in the chapter of his _Spanish Conquest_ on\r\nInca civilization, which covers forty-five pages, only cited two early\r\nauthorities not used by Prescott,[1276] and his sketch is much more\r\nsuperficial than that of his predecessor.[1277]\r\n\r\nThe publication of the _Antigüedades Peruanas_ by Don Mariano Eduardo\r\nde Rivero (the director of the National Museum at Lima) and Juan Diego\r\nde Tschudi at Vienna, in 1851, marked an important turning-point in the\r\nprogress of investigation. One of the authors was himself a Peruvian,\r\nand from that time some of the best educated natives of the country\r\nhave given their attention to its early history. The _Antigüedades_\r\nfor the first time gives due prominence to an estimate of the language\r\nand literature of the Incas, and to descriptions of ruins throughout\r\nPeru. The work is accompanied by a large atlas of engravings; but it\r\ncontains grave inaccuracies, and the map of Pachacamac is a serious\r\nblemish to the work.[1278] The _Antigüedades_ were followed by the\r\n_Annals of Cuzco_,[1279] and in 1860 the _Ancient History of Peru_,\r\nby Don Sebastian Lorente, was published at Lima.[1280] In a series of\r\nessays in the _Revista Peruana_,[1281] Lorente gave the results of many\r\nyears of further study of the subject, which appear to have been the\r\nconcluding labors of a useful life. When he died, in November, 1884,\r\nSebastian Lorente had been engaged for upwards of forty years in the\r\ninstruction of the Peruvian youth at Lima and in other useful labors.\r\nA curious genealogical work on the Incarial family was published at\r\nParis in 1850, by Dr. Justo Sahuaraura Inca, a canon of the cathedral\r\nof Cuzco, but it is of no historical value.[1282]\r\n\r\nSeveral scholars, both in Europe and America, have published the\r\nresults of their studies relating to the problems of Inca history.\r\nErnest Desjardins has written on the state of Peru before the\r\nSpanish conquest,[1283] J. G. Müller on the religious beliefs of the\r\npeople,[1284] and Waitz on Peruvian anthropology.[1285] The writings\r\nof Dr. Brinton, of Philadelphia, also contain valuable reflections and\r\nuseful information respecting the mythology and native literature of\r\nPeru.[1286] Mr. Bollaert had been interested in Peruvian researches\r\nduring the greater part of his lifetime (b. 1807; d. 1876), and had\r\nvisited several provinces of Peru, especially Tarapaca. He accumulated\r\nmany notes. His work, at first sight, appears to be merely a confused\r\nmass of jottings, and certainly there is an absence of method and\r\narrangement; but closer examination will lead to the discovery of many\r\nfacts which are not to be met with elsewhere.[1287]\r\n\r\nA critical study of early authorities and a knowledge of the Quichua\r\nlanguage are two essential qualifications for a writer on Inca\r\ncivilization. But it is almost equally important that he should have\r\naccess to intelligent and accurate descriptions of the remains of\r\nancient edifices and public works throughout Peru. For this he is\r\ndependent on travellers, and it must be confessed that no descriptions\r\nat all meeting the requirements were in existence before the opening of\r\nthe present century. Humboldt was the first traveller in South America\r\nwho pursued his antiquarian researches on a scientific basis. His works\r\nare models for all future travellers. It is to Humboldt,[1288] and his\r\npredecessors the Ulloas,[1289] that we owe graphic descriptions of Inca\r\nruins in the kingdom of Quito and in northern Peru as far as Caxamarca.\r\nFrench travellers have contributed three works of importance to the\r\nsame department of research. M. Alcide D’Orbigny examined and described\r\nthe ruins of Tiahuanacu with great care.[1290] M. François de Castelnau\r\nwas the leader of a scientific expedition sent out by the French\r\ngovernment, and his work contains descriptions of ruins illustrated by\r\nplates.[1291] The work of M. Wiener is more complete, and is intended\r\nto be exhaustive. He was also employed by the French government on an\r\narchæological and ethnographic mission to Peru, from 1875 to 1877, and\r\nhe has performed his task with diligence and ability, while no cost\r\nseems to have been spared in the production of his work.[1292] The\r\nmaps and illustrations are numerous and well executed, and M. Wiener\r\nvisited nearly every part of Peru where archæological remains are to\r\nbe met with. There is only one fault to be found with the praiseworthy\r\nand elaborate works of D’Orbigny and Wiener. The authors are too apt to\r\nadopt theories on insufficient grounds, and to confuse their otherwise\r\nadmirable descriptions with imaginative speculations. An example of\r\nthis kind has been pointed out by the Peruvian scholar Dr. Villar,\r\nwith reference to M. Wiener’s erroneous ideas respecting _Culte de\r\nl’eau ou de la pluie, et le dieu Quonn_.[1293] M. Wiener is the only\r\nmodern traveller who has visited and described the interesting ruins of\r\nVilcashuaman.\r\n\r\nThe present writer has published two books recording his travels in\r\nPeru. In the first he described the fortress of Hervay, the ancient\r\nirrigation channels at Nasca on the Peruvian coast, and the ruins at\r\nand around Cuzco, including Ollantay-tampu.[1294] In the second there\r\nare descriptions of the _chulpas_ at Sillustani in the Collao, and of\r\nthe Inca roof over the Sunturhuasi at Azangaro.[1295]\r\n\r\nThe work of E. G. Squier is, on the whole, the most valuable result\r\nof antiquarian researches in Peru that has ever been presented to the\r\npublic.[1296] Mr. Squier had special qualifications for the task. He\r\nhad already been engaged on similar work in Nicaragua, and he was well\r\nversed in the history of his subject. He visited nearly all the ruins\r\nof importance in the country, constructed plans, and took numerous\r\nphotographs. Avoiding theoretical disquisitions, he gives most accurate\r\ndescriptions of the architectural remains, which are invaluable to the\r\nstudent. His style is agreeable and interesting, while it inspires\r\nconfidence in the reader; and his admirable book is in all respects\r\nthoroughly workmanlike.[1297]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLEMENTS R. MARKHAM.\r\n\r\n[After a photograph kindly furnished by himself at the editor’s\r\nrequest.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nTiahuanacu is minutely described by D’Orbigny, Wiener, and Squier, and\r\nthe famous ruins have also been the objects of special attention from\r\nother investigators. Mr. Helsby of Liverpool took careful photographs\r\nof the monolithic doorway in 1857, which were engraved and published,\r\nwith a descriptive article by Mr. Bollaert.[1298] Don Modesto Basadre\r\nhas also written an account of the ruins, with measurements.[1299]\r\nBut the most complete monograph on Tiahuanacu is by Mr. Inwards, who\r\nsurveyed the ground, photographed all the ruins, made enlarged drawings\r\nof the sculptures on the monolithic doorway, and even attempted an\r\nideal restoration of the palace. In the letter-press, Mr. Inwards\r\nquotes from the only authorities who give any account of Tiahuanacu,\r\nand on this particular point his monograph entitles him to be\r\nconsidered as the highest modern authority.[1300]\r\n\r\nAnother special investigation of equal interest, and even greater\r\ncompleteness, is represented by the superb work on the burial-ground\r\nof Ancon, being the results of excavations made on the spot by Wilhelm\r\nReiss and Alphonso Stübel. The researches of these painstaking and\r\ntalented antiquaries have thrown a flood of light on the social habits\r\nand daily life of the civilized people of the Peruvian coast.[1301]\r\n\r\nThe great work of Don Antonio Raimondi on Peru is still incomplete.\r\nThe learned Italian has already devoted thirty-eight years to the\r\nstudy of the natural history of his adopted country, and the results\r\nof his prolonged scientific labors are now gradually being given to\r\nthe public. The plan of this exhaustive monograph is a division into\r\nsix parts, devoted to the geography, geology, mineralogy, botany,\r\nzoölogy, and ethnology of Peru. The geographical division will contain\r\na description of the principal ancient monuments and their ruins,\r\nwhile the ethnology will include a treatise on the ancient races,\r\ntheir origin and civilization. But as yet only three volumes have been\r\npublished. The first is entitled _Parte Preliminar_, describing the\r\nplan of the work and the extent of the author’s travels throughout\r\nthe country. The second and third volumes comprise a history of the\r\nprogress of geographical discovery in Peru since the conquest by\r\nPizarro. The completion of this great work, undertaken under the\r\nauspices of the government of Peru, has been long delayed.[1302]\r\n\r\nThe labors of explorers are supplemented by the editorial work of\r\nscholars, who bring to light the precious relics of early authorities,\r\nhitherto buried in scarcely accessible old volumes or in manuscript.\r\nFirst in the ranks of these laborers in the cause of knowledge, as\r\nregards ancient Peruvian history, stands the name of M. Ternaux\r\nCompans. He has furnished to the student carefully edited French\r\neditions of the narrative of Xeres, of the history of Peru by Balboa,\r\nof the _Mémoires Historiques_ of Montesinos, and of the history of\r\nQuito by Velasco.[1303]\r\n\r\nThe present writer has translated into English and edited the works\r\nof Cieza de Leon, Garcilasso de la Vega, Molina, Salcamayhua, Avila,\r\nXeres, Andagoya, and one of the reports of Ondegardo, and has edited\r\nthe old translation of Acosta.\r\n\r\nDr. M. Gonzalez de la Rosa, an accomplished Peruvian scholar, brought\r\nto light and edited, in 1879, the curious _Historia de Lima_ of Father\r\nBernabé Cobo. It was published in successive numbers of the _Revista\r\nPeruana_, at Lima.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MÁRCOS JIMÉNEZ DE LA ESPADA.\r\n\r\n[After a photograph, kindly furnished by himself, at the editor’s\r\nrequest.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nBut in this department students are most indebted to the learned\r\nSpanish editor, Don Márcos Jiménez de la Espada; for he has placed\r\nwithin our reach the works of important authorities, which were\r\npreviously not only inaccessible, but unknown. He has edited the second\r\npart of Cieza de Leon, the anonymous Jesuit, Montesinos, Santillana,\r\nthe reports to the Viceroy Toledo, the _Suma y Narracion_ of Betanzos,\r\nand the _War of Quito_, by Cieza de Leon. Moreover, there is every\r\nreason to hope that his career of literary usefulness is by no means\r\nended.\r\n\r\nAlthough so much has been accomplished in the field of Peruvian\r\nresearch, yet much remains to be done, both by explorers and in\r\nthe study. The Quichua chapters of the work of Avila, containing\r\ncurious myths and legends, remain untranslated and in manuscript.\r\nA satisfactory text of the Ollantay drama, after collation of all\r\naccessible manuscripts, has not yet been secured. Numerous precious\r\nmanuscripts have yet to be unearthed in Spain. Songs of the times of\r\nthe Incas exist in Peru, which should be collected and edited. There\r\nare scientific excavations to be undertaken, and secluded districts to\r\nbe explored. The Yunca grammar of Carrera requires expert comparative\r\nstudy, and comparison with the Eten dialect. Remnants of archaic\r\nlanguages, such as the Puquina of the Urus, must be investigated. When\r\nall this, and much more, has been added to existing means of knowledge,\r\nthe labors of pioneers will approach completion. Then the time will\r\nhave arrived for the preparation of a history of ancient Peruvian\r\ncivilization which will be worthy of the subject.[1304]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Autograph: Clements R Markham]]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=I.= ANCIENT PEOPLE OF THE PERUVIAN COAST.—There was a civilized people\r\non the coast of Peru, but not occupying the whole coast, which was\r\ndistinctly different, both as regards race and language, from the Incas\r\nand their cognate tribes. This coast nation was called _Chimu_, and\r\ntheir language _Mochica_.[1305]\r\n\r\nThe numerous valleys on the Peruvian coast, separated by sandy deserts\r\nof varying width, required only careful irrigation to render them\r\ncapable of sustaining a large population. The aboriginal inhabitants\r\nwere probably a diminutive race of fishermen. Driven southwards\r\nby invaders, they eventually sought refuge in Arica and Tarapaca.\r\nD’Orbigny described their descendants as a gentle, hospitable race\r\nof fishermen, never exceeding five feet in height, with flat noses,\r\nfishing in boats of inflated sealskins, and sleeping in huts of\r\nsealskin on heaps of dried seaweed. They are called Changos. Bollaert\r\nmentions that they buried their dead lengthways. Bodies found in this\r\nunusual posture near Cañete form a slight link connecting the Changos\r\nto the south with the early aboriginal race of the more northern\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nThe _Chimu_ people drove out the aborigines and occupied the valleys of\r\nthe coast from Payta nearly to Lima, forming distinct communities, each\r\nunder a chief more or less independent. The _Chimu_ himself ruled over\r\nthe five valleys of Parmunca, Hualli, Huanapu, Santa, and Chimu, where\r\nthe city of Truxillo now stands. The total difference of their language\r\nfrom Quichua makes it clear that the Chimus did not come from the Andes\r\nor from the Quito country. The only other alternative is that they\r\narrived from the sea. Balboa, indeed, gives a detailed account of the\r\nstatements made by the coast Indians of Lambayeque, at the time of the\r\nconquest. They declared that a great fleet arrived on the coast some\r\ngenerations earlier, commanded by a chief named Noymlap, who had with\r\nhim a green-stone idol, and that he founded a dynasty of chiefs.\r\n\r\nThe _Chimu_ and his subjects, let their origin be what it may, had\r\ncertainly made considerable advances in civilization. The vast palaces\r\nof the Chimu near the seashore, with a surrounding city, and great\r\nmounds or artificial hills, are astonishing even in their decay. The\r\nprincipal hall of the palace was 100 feet long by 52. The walls are\r\ncovered with an intricate and very effective series of arabesques on\r\nstucco, worked in relief. A neighboring hall, with walls stuccoed in\r\ncolor, is entered by passages and skirted by openings leading to small\r\nrooms seven feet square, which may have been used as dormitories.\r\nA long corridor leads from the back of the arabesque hall to some\r\nrecesses where gold and silver vessels have been found. At a short\r\ndistance from this palace there is a sepulchral mound where many\r\nrelics have been discovered. The bodies were wrapped in cloths woven\r\nin ornamental figures and patterns of different colors. On some of the\r\ncloths plates of silver were sewn, and they were edged with borders\r\nof feathers, the silver plates being occasionally cut in the shapes\r\nof fishes and birds. Among the ruins of the city there are great\r\nrectangular areas enclosed by massive walls, containing buildings,\r\ncourts, streets, and reservoirs for water.[1306] The largest is about\r\na mile south of the palace, and is 550 yards long by 400. The outer\r\nwall is about 30 feet high and 10 feet thick at the base, with sides\r\ninclining towards each other. Some of the interior walls are highly\r\nornamented in stuccoed patterns; and in one part there is an edifice\r\ncontaining 45 chambers or cells, which is supposed to have been a\r\nprison. The enclosure also contained a reservoir 450 feet long by 195,\r\nand 60 feet deep.\r\n\r\nThe dry climate favored the adornment of outer walls by color, and\r\nthose of the Chimu palaces were covered with very tasteful sculptured\r\npatterns. Figures of colored birds and animals are said to have been\r\npainted on the walls of temples and palaces. Silver and gold ornaments\r\nand utensils, mantles richly embroidered, robes of feathers, cotton\r\ncloths of fine texture, and vases of an infinite variety of curious\r\ndesigns, are found in the tombs.\r\n\r\nCieza de Leon gives us a momentary glimpse at the life of the Chimu\r\nchiefs. Each ruler of a valley, he tells us, had a great house with\r\nadobe pillars, and doorways hung with matting, built on extensive\r\nterraces. He adds that the chiefs dressed in cotton shirts and long\r\nmantles, and were fond of drinking-bouts, dancing and singing. The\r\nwalls of their houses were painted with bright colored patterns and\r\nfigures. Such places, rising out of the groves of fruit-trees, with the\r\nAndes bounding the view in one direction and the ocean in the other,\r\nmust have been suitable abodes for joy and feasting. Around them were\r\nthe fertile valleys, peopled by industrious cultivators, and carefully\r\nirrigated. Their irrigation works were indeed stupendous. “In the\r\nvalley of Nepeña the reservoir is three fourths of a mile long by more\r\nthan half a mile broad, and consists of a massive dam of stone 80 feet\r\nthick at the base, carried across a gorge between two rocky hills.\r\nIt was supplied by two canals at different elevations; one starting\r\nfourteen miles up the valley, and the other from springs five miles\r\ndistant.”[1307]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF A MUMMY-CASE FROM ANCON.\r\n\r\n[After a cut given by Ruge, following a plate in _The Necropolis of\r\nAncon_. Wiener (p. 44) gives a section of one of the Ancon tombs. See a\r\ncut in Squier’s _Peru_, p. 73.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe custom prevalent among the Chimus of depositing with their dead\r\nall objects of daily use, as well as ornaments and garments worn by\r\nthem during life, has enabled us to gain a further insight into the\r\nsocial history of this interesting people. The researches of Reuss and\r\nStübel at the necropolis of Ancon, near Lima, have been most important.\r\nNumerous garments, interwoven with work of a decorative character,\r\ncloths of many colors and complicated patterns, implements used in\r\nspinning and sewing, work-baskets of plaited grass, balls of thread,\r\nfingerrings, wooden and clay toys, are found with the mummies. The\r\nspindles are richly carved and painted, and attached to them are terra\r\ncotta cylinders aglow with ornamental colorings which were used as\r\nwheels. Fine earthenware vases of varied patterns, and wooden or clay\r\ndishes, also occur.\r\n\r\nTurning to the language of the coast people, we find that no Mochica\r\ndictionary was ever made; but there is a grammar and a short list of\r\nwords by Carrera, and the Lord’s prayer in Mochica, by Bishop Oré. The\r\ngrammar was composed by a priest who had settled at Truxillo, near\r\nthe ruins of the Chimu palace, and who was a great-grandson of one of\r\nthe first Spanish conquerors. It was published at Lima in 1644. At\r\nthat time the Mochica language was spoken in the valleys of Truxillo,\r\nChicama, Chocope, Sana, Lambayeque, Chiclayo, Huacabamba, Olmos, and\r\nMotupè. When the _Mercurio Peruano_[1308] was published in 1793, this\r\nlanguage is said to have entirely disappeared. Father Carrera tells us\r\nthat the Mochica was so very difficult that he was the only Spaniard\r\nwho had ever been able to learn it. The words bear no resemblance\r\nwhatever to Quichua. Mochica has three different declensions, Quichua\r\nonly one. Mochica has no transitive verbs, and no exclusive and\r\ninclusive plurals, which are among the chief characteristics of\r\nQuichua. The Mochica conjugations are formed in quite a different way\r\nfrom those in the Quichua language. The Mochica system of numerals\r\nappears to have been very complete. With the language, the people\r\nhave now almost if not entirely disappeared. Possibly the people of\r\nEten, south of Lambayeque, who still speak a peculiar language, may be\r\ndescendants of the Chimus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUMMY FROM A HUACA AT PISCO.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in T. J. Hutchinson’s _Two Years in Peru_ (London, 1873),\r\nvol. i. p. 113. The Peruvian mummies are almost invariably simply\r\ndesiccated. Only the royal personages were embalmed (Markham’s _Cieza\r\nde Leon_, 226). Cf. Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_, ii. 135.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nThe Chimu dominion extended probably from Tumbez, in the extreme north\r\nof the Peruvian coast, to Ancon, north of Lima. The Chimus also had\r\na strong colony in the valley of Huarcu, now called Cañete. But the\r\nvalleys of the Rimac, of Lurin, Chilca, and Mala, north of Cañete;\r\nand those of Chincha, Yca, and Nasca, south of Cañete; were not Chimu\r\nterritory. The names of places in those valleys are all Quichua,\r\nas well as the names of their chiefs, as recorded by Garcilasso de\r\nla Vega and others. The inhabitants were, therefore, of Inca race,\r\nprobably colonists from the Huanca nation. Their superstitions as told\r\nby Arriaga, and the curious mythological legends recorded by Avila as\r\nbeing believed by the people of Huarochiri and the neighboring coast,\r\nall point to an Inca origin. These Inca coast people are said to have\r\nhad a famous oracle near the present site of Lima, called “Rimac,” or\r\n“He who speaks.” But more probably it was merely the name given to the\r\nnoisy river Rimac, babbling over its stones. It is true that there\r\nwas a temple on the coast with an oracle, the fame of which had been\r\nwidely spread. The idol called Pachacamac, or “The world-creator,”\r\nwas described by the first Spanish visitor, Miguel Estete, as being\r\nmade of wood and very dirty. The town was then half in ruins, for the\r\nworship of this local deity was neglected after the conquest by the\r\nIncas. These coast people of Inca race were as industrious as their\r\nChimu neighbors. In the Nasca valley there is a complete network of\r\nunderground watercourses for irrigation. At Yca “they removed the sand\r\nfrom vast areas, until they reached the requisite moisture, then put in\r\nguano from the islands, and thus formed sunken gardens of extraordinary\r\nrichness.”[1309] Similar methods were adopted in the valleys of Pisco\r\nand Chilca.\r\n\r\nWhen the Inca Pachacutec began to annex the coast valleys, he met\r\nwith slight opposition only from the people of Inca origin, who soon\r\nsubmitted to his rule. But the Chimus struggled hard to retain their\r\nindependence. Those of the Huarcu (_Cañete_) valley made a desperate\r\nand prolonged resistance. When at length they submitted, the Inca\r\nbuilt a fortress and palace on a rocky eminence overlooking the sea to\r\noverawe them. The ruins now called Hervai are particularly interesting,\r\nbecause they are the principal and most imposing example of Inca\r\narchitecture in which the building material is adobes and not stone.\r\nThe conquest of the valleys to the north of Lima and of the grand Chimu\r\nhimself was a still more difficult undertaking, necessitating more\r\nthan one hard-fought campaign. When it was completed, great numbers of\r\nthe best fighting-men among the Chimus were deported to the interior\r\nas _mitimaes_. More than a century had elapsed since this conquest\r\nwhen the Spaniards arrived, so that there was but slight chance of the\r\nhistory of the Chimus being even partially preserved. Cieza de Leon and\r\nBalboa alone supply us with notices of any value.[1310] The southern\r\nvalleys of the coast, Arequipa, Moquegua, and Tacna, were occupied by\r\n_mitimaes_ or colonists from the Collao. The Incas gave the general\r\nname of _yuncas_, or dwellers in the warm valleys, to all the people of\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nMuch mystery surrounds the history and origin of the _Chimu_ people.\r\nThat they were wholly separate and unconnected with the other races of\r\nPeru seems almost certain. That they were far advanced in civilization\r\nis clear. Difficulties surround any further prosecution of researches\r\nconcerning them. They have themselves disappeared from the face of the\r\nearth. Their language has gone with them. But there are the magnificent\r\nruins of their palaces and temples. There are numerous tombs and\r\ncemeteries which have never been scientifically examined. There is a\r\ngrammar and a small vocabulary of words calling for close comparative\r\nexamination. There are crania awaiting similar comparative study. There\r\nis a possibility that further information may be gleaned from inedited\r\nSpanish manuscripts. The subject is a most interesting one, and it is\r\nby no means exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAPESTRY FROM THE GRAVES OF ANCON.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in Ruge’s _Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen_, p.\r\n429, following the colored plate in _The Necropolis of Ancon_. Wiener\r\nreproduces in black and white many of the Ancon specimens.—ED.]]\r\n\r\n=II.= THE QUICHUA LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE.—No real progress can be\r\nmade in the work of elucidating the ancient history of Peru, and in\r\nunravelling the interesting but still unsolved questions relating to\r\nthe origin and development of Inca civilization, without a knowledge\r\nof the native language. The subject has accordingly received the close\r\nattention of laborious students from a very early period, and the\r\npresent essay would be incomplete without appending an enumeration of\r\nthe Quichua grammars and vocabularies, and of works relating to Inca\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nFray Domingo de San Tomas, a Dominican monk, was the first author who\r\ncomposed a grammar and vocabulary of the language of the Incas. He gave\r\nit the name of Quichua, probably because he had studied with members of\r\nthat tribe, who were of pure Inca race, and whose territory lies to the\r\nwestward of Cuzco. The name has since been generally adopted for the\r\nlanguage of the Peruvian empire.[1311]\r\n\r\nDiego de Torres Rubio was born in 1547, in a village near Toledo,\r\nbecame a Jesuit at the age of nineteen, and went out to Peru in 1577.\r\nHe studied the native languages with great diligence, and composed\r\ngrammars and vocabularies. His grammar and vocabulary of Quichua first\r\nappeared at Saville in 1603, and passed through four editions.[1312]\r\nA long residence in Chuquisaca enabled him to acquire the Aymara\r\nlanguage, and in 1616 he published a short grammar and vocabulary of\r\nAymara. In 1627 he also published a grammar of the Guarani language.\r\nTorres Rubio was rector of the college at Potosi for a short time, but\r\nhis principal labors were connected with missionary work at Chuquisaca.\r\nHe died in that city at the great age of ninety-one, on the 13th of\r\nApril, 1638. Juan de Figueredo, whose Chinchaysuyu vocabulary is bound\r\nup with later editions of Torres Rubio, was born at Huancavelica in\r\n1648, of Spanish parents, and after a long and useful missionary life\r\nhe died at Lima in 1724.\r\n\r\nThe most voluminous grammatical work on the language of the Incas\r\nhad for its author the Jesuit Diego Gonzales Holguin. This learned\r\nmissionary was the scion of a distinguished family in Estremadura,\r\nand was befriended in his youth by his relation, Don Juan de Obando,\r\nPresident of the Council of the Indies. After graduating at Alcalá\r\nde Henares he became a member of the Society of Jesus in 1568, and\r\nwent out to Peru in 1581. He resided for several years in the Jesuit\r\ncollege at Juli, near the banks of Lake Titicaca, where the fathers had\r\nestablished a printing-press, and here he studied the Quichua language.\r\nHe was entrusted with important missions to Quito and Chili, and was\r\nnominated interpreter by the Viceroy Toledo. His later years were\r\npassed in Paraguay, and when he died at the age of sixty-six, in 1618,\r\nhe was rector of the college at Asuncion. His Quichua dictionary was\r\npublished at Lima in 1586, and a second edition appeared in 1607,[1313]\r\nthe same year in which the grammar first saw the light.[1314] The\r\nQuichua grammar of Holguin is the most complete and elaborate that has\r\nbeen written, and his dictionary is also the best in every respect.\r\n\r\nWhile Holguin was studiously preparing these valuable works on the\r\nQuichua language in the college at Juli, a colleague was laboring with\r\nequal zeal and assiduity at the dialect spoken by the people of the\r\nCollao, to which the Jesuits gave the name of Aymara. Ludovico Bertonio\r\nwas an Italian, a native of the marches of Ancona. Arriving in Peru in\r\n1581, he resided at Juli for many years, studying the Aymara language,\r\nuntil, attacked by gout, he was sent to Lima, where he died at the age\r\nof seventy-three, in 1625. His Aymara grammar was first published at\r\nRome in 1603,[1315] but a very much improved second edition,[1316] and\r\na large dictionary of Aymara,[1317] were products of the Jesuit press\r\nat Juli in 1612. Bertonio also wrote a catechism and a life of Christ\r\nin Aymara, which were printed at Juli.\r\n\r\nA vocabulary of Quichua by Fray Juan Martinez was printed at Lima in\r\n1604, and another in 1614. Four Quichua grammars followed during the\r\nseventeenth century. That of Alonso de Huerta was published at Lima in\r\n1616; the grammar of the Franciscan Diego de Olmos appeared in 1633;\r\nDon Juan Roxo Mexia y Ocon, a native of Cuzco, and professor of Quichua\r\nat the University of Lima, published his grammar in 1648; and the\r\ngrammar of Estevan Sancho de Melgar saw the light in 1691.[1318] Leon\r\nPinelo also mentions a Quichua grammar by Juan de Vega. The anonymous\r\nJesuit refers to a Quichua dictionary by Melchior Fernandez, which is\r\nlost to us.\r\n\r\nIn 1644 Don Fernando de la Carrera, the Cura of Reque, near Chiclayo,\r\npublished his grammar of the Yunca language, at Lima. This is the\r\nlanguage which was once spoken in the valleys of the Peruvian coast\r\nby the civilized people whose ruler was the grand Chimu. Now the\r\nlanguage is extinct, or spoken only by a few Indians in the coast\r\nvillage of Eten. The work of Carrera is therefore important, as, with\r\nthe exception of a specimen of the language preserved by Bishop Oré,\r\nit is the only book in which the student can now obtain any linguistic\r\nknowledge of the lost civilization. The Yunca grammar was reprinted in\r\nnumbers in the _Revista de Lima_ of 1880 and following years.[1319]\r\n\r\nThere was a professorial chair for the study of Quichua in the\r\nUniversity of San Márcos at Lima, and the language was cultivated,\r\nduring the two centuries after the conquest, as well by educated\r\nnatives as by many Spanish ecclesiastics. The sermons of Dr. Don\r\nFernando de Avendaño have already been referred to.[1320] Dr.\r\nLunarejo, of Cuzco, was another famous Quichuan preacher, and the\r\n_Confesionarios_ and catechisms in the language were very numerous.\r\nBishop Louis Geronimo Oré, of Guamanga, in his ritualistic manual,\r\ngives the Lord’s prayer and commandments, not only in Quichua and\r\nAymara, but also in the Puquina language spoken by the Urus on Lake\r\nTiticaca, and in the Yunca language of the coast, which he calls\r\nMochica.[1321]\r\n\r\nA very curious book was published at Lima in 1602, which, among other\r\nthings, treats of the Quichua language and of the derivations of names\r\nof places. The author, Don Diego D’Avalos y Figueroa, appears to have\r\nbeen a native of La Paz. He was possessed of sprightly wit, was well\r\nread, and a close observer of nature. We gather from his _Miscelanea\r\nAustral_[1322] the names of birds and animals, and of fishes in Lake\r\nTiticaca, as well as the opinions of the author on the cause of the\r\nabsence of rain on the Peruvian coast, on the lacustrine system of the\r\nCollao, and on other interesting points of physical geography.[1323]\r\n\r\nIn modern times the language of the Incas has received attention from\r\nstudents of Peruvian history. The joint authors, Dr. Von Tschudi and\r\nDon Mariano Eduardo de Rivero, in their work entitled _Antigüedades\r\nPeruanas_, published at Vienna in 1851, devote a chapter to the\r\nQuichua language. Two years afterwards Dr. Von Tschudi published a\r\nQuichua grammar and dictionary, with the text of the Inca drama of\r\nOllantay, and other specimens of the language.[1324] The present\r\nwriter’s contributions towards a grammar and dictionary of Quichua\r\nwere published by Trübner in 1864, and a few years previously a more\r\ncomplete and elaborate work had seen the light at Sucre, the capital of\r\nBolivia. This was the grammar and dictionary by Father Honorio Mossi,\r\nof Potosi, a large volume containing thorough and excellent work.[1325]\r\nLastly a Quichua grammar by José Dionisio Anchorena was published at\r\nLima in 1874.[1326]\r\n\r\nThe curious publication of Don José Fernandez Nodal in 1874 is not so\r\nmuch a grammar of the Quichua Language as a heterogeneous collection\r\nof notes on all sorts of subjects, and can scarcely take a place among\r\nserious works. The author was a native of Arequipa, of good family, but\r\nhe was carried away by enthusiasm and allowed his imagination to run\r\nriot.[1327]\r\n\r\nThe gospel of St. Luke, with Aymara and Spanish in parallel columns,\r\nwas translated from the vulgate by Don Vicente Pazos-kanki, a graduate\r\nof the University of Cuzco, and published in London in 1829;[1328] and\r\nmore recently a Quichua version of the gospel of St. John, translated\r\nby Mr. Spilsbury, an English missionary, has appeared at Buenos\r\nAyres.[1329] These publications and others of the same kind have a\r\ntendency to preserve the purity of the language, and are therefore\r\nwelcome to the student of Incarial history.\r\n\r\nQuichua has been the subject of detailed comparative study by more\r\nthan one modern philologist of eminence. The discussion of the Quichua\r\nroots by the learned Dr. Vicente Fidel Lopez is a most valuable\r\naddition to the literature of the subject; while the historical section\r\nof his work is a great aid to a critical consideration of Montesinos\r\nand other early authorities. Whatever may be thought of his theoretical\r\nopinions, and of the considerations by which he maintains them, there\r\ncan be no doubt that Dr. Lopez has rendered most important service to\r\nall students of Peruvian history.[1330] The theoretical identification\r\nof Quichuan roots with those of Turanian and Iberian languages, as it\r\nhas been elaborated by Mr. Ellis, is also not without its use, quite\r\napart from the truth or otherwise of any linguistic theory.[1331]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM TIMANÁ.\r\n\r\n[After a cut in William Bollaert’s _Antiquarian Researches_, etc., p.\r\n41, showing a stone figure from Timana in New Granada, an antiquity of\r\nthe Muiscas, found in a dense forest, with no tradition attached.—ED.]]\r\n\r\nEditorial labors connected with the publication of the text and of\r\ntranslations of the Inca drama of Ollantay have recently conduced, in\r\nan eminent degree, to the scholarly study of Quichua, while they have\r\nsensibly contributed to a better knowledge of the subject. Von Tschudi\r\nwas the first to publish the text of Ollantay, in the second part of\r\nhis _Kechua Sprache_, having given extracts from the drama in the\r\nchapter on the Quichua language in the _Antigüedades Peruanas_. After\r\na long interval he brought out a revised text with a parallel German\r\ntranslation,[1332] from his former manuscript, collated with another\r\nbearing the date of La Paz, 1735.\r\n\r\nThe drama, in the exact form that it existed when represented before\r\nthe Incas, is of course lost to us. It was handed down by tradition\r\nuntil it was arranged for representation, divided into scenes, and\r\nsupplied with stage directions in Spanish times. Several manuscripts\r\nwere preserved, which differ only slightly from each other; and they\r\nwere looked upon as very precious literary treasures by their owners.\r\nThe drama was first publicly brought to notice by Don Manuel Palacios,\r\nin the _Museo Erudito_, a periodical published at Cuzco in 1837; but\r\nit was not until 1853 that the text was printed by Von Tschudi. His\r\nmanuscript was copied from one preserved in the Dominican monastery at\r\nCuzco by one of the monks. The transcription was made between 1840 and\r\n1845 for the artist Rugendas, of Munich, who gave it to Von Tschudi.\r\nThere was another old manuscript in the possession of Dr. Antonio\r\nValdez, the priest of Sicuani, who lived in the last century, and was\r\na friend of the unfortunate Tupac Amaru. Dr. Valdez died in 1816; and\r\ncopies of his manuscript were possessed by Dr. Pablo Justiniani, the\r\naged priest of Laris, a village in the heart of the eastern Andes, and\r\nby Dr. Rosas, the priest of Chinchero. The present writer made a copy\r\nof the Justiniani manuscript at Laris, which he collated with that of\r\nDr. Rosas. In 1871 he published the text of his copy, with an attempt\r\nat a literal English translation.[1333] In 1868 Dr. Barranca published\r\na Spanish translation from the text of Von Tschudi, now called the\r\nDominican text.[1334] The Peruvian poet Constantino Carrasco afterwards\r\nbrought out a version of the drama of Ollantay in verse, paraphrased\r\nfrom the translation of Barranca.[1335] The enthusiastic Peruvian\r\nstudent, Dr. Nodal, printed a different Quichua text with a Spanish\r\ntranslation, in parallel columns, in 1874.[1336]\r\n\r\nThere are other manuscripts, and a text has not yet been derived\r\nfrom a scholarly collation of the whole of them. There is one in the\r\npossession of Dr. Gonzalez de la Rosa, which belonged to Dr. Justo\r\nSahuaraura Inca, Archdeacon of Cuzco, and descendant of Paullu, the\r\nyounger son of Huayna Ccapac. In 1878 the Quichua scholar and native of\r\nCuzco, Don Gavino Pacheco Zegarra, published the text of Ollantay at\r\nParis, from a manuscript found among the books of his great-uncle, Don\r\nPedro Zegarra. He added a very free translation in French, and numerous\r\nvaluable notes. The work of Zegarra is by far the most important\r\nthat has appeared on this subject, for the accomplished Peruvian has\r\nthe great advantage of knowing Quichua from his earliest childhood.\r\nWith this advantage, not possessed by any previous writer, he unites\r\nextensive learning and considerable critical sagacity.[1337]\r\n\r\nThe reasons for assigning an ancient date to this drama of Ollantay\r\nare conclusive in the judgment of all Quichua scholars. On this point\r\nthere is a consensus of opinion. But General Mitre, the ex-President\r\nof the Argentine Republic, published an essay in 1881, to prove that\r\nOllantay was of Spanish origin and was written in comparatively\r\nmodern times.[1338] The present writer replied to his arguments in\r\nthe introduction (p. xxix) to the English translation of the second\r\npart of _Cieza de Leon_ (1883), and this reply was translated into\r\nSpanish and published at Buenos Ayres in the same year, by Don Adolfo\r\nF. Olivares, accompanied by a critical note from the pen of Dr. Vicente\r\nLopez.[1339] The latest publication on the subject of Ollantay consists\r\nof a series of articles in the _Ateneo de Lima_, by Don E. Larrabure y\r\nUnanue, the accomplished author of a history of the conquest of Peru,\r\nnot yet published. The general conclusion which has been arrived at\r\nby Quichua scholars, after this thorough sifting of the question, is\r\nthat, although the division into scenes and the stage directions are\r\ndue to some Spanish hand, and although some few Hispanicisms may have\r\ncrept into some of the texts, owing to the carelessness or ignorance\r\nof transcribers, yet that the drama of Ollantay, in all essential\r\npoints, is of Inca origin. Several old songs are imbedded in it, and\r\nothers have been preserved by Quichua scholars at Cuzco and Ayacucho,\r\nand in the neighborhood of those cities. The editing of these remains\r\nof Inca literature will, at some future time, throw further light\r\non the history of the past. There are several learned Peruvians who\r\ndevote themselves to Incarial studies, besides Señor Zegarra, who now\r\nresides in Spain. Among them may be mentioned Dr. Villar of Cuzco, a\r\nripe scholar, who has recently published a closely reasoned essay on\r\nthe word _Uira-cocha_, Don Luis Carranza, and Don Martin A. Mujica, a\r\nnative of Huancavelica.\r\n\r\n\r\n=III.= THE NEW GRANADA TRIBES.—The incipient civilization of the\r\nChibchas or Muiscas of New Granada was first made generally known by\r\nHumboldt (_Vues des Cordillères_, octavo ed., ii. 220-67; _Views of\r\nNature_, Eng. trans., 425).

ELLIS, D. D., LL. D.\r\n\r\n_President of the Massachusetts Historical Society._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE relations into which the first Europeans entered with the\r\naborigines in North America were very largely influenced, if not\r\nwholly decided, by the relations which they found to exist among the\r\ntribes on their arrival here. Those relations were fiercely hostile.\r\nThe new-comers in every instance and in every crisis found their\r\nopportunity and their immunity in the feuds existing among tribes\r\nalready in conflict with each other. This state of things, while it\r\ngave the whites enemies, also furnished them with allies. So far as the\r\nwhites could learn in their earliest inquiries, internecine strife had\r\nbeen waging here among the natives from an indefinite past.\r\n\r\nStarting, then, from this hostile relation between the native tribes of\r\nthe northerly parts of the continent, we may trace the development of\r\nour subject through five periods:—\r\n\r\n1. The first period, a very brief one, is marked by the presence\r\nof a single European nationality here, the French, for whom, under\r\nstringency of circumstance that he might be in friendly alliance with\r\none tribe, Champlain was compelled to espouse its existing feud with\r\nother tribes.\r\n\r\n2. The next period opens with the appearance and sharp rivalry here of\r\na second European nationality, the English, the hereditary foe of the\r\nFrench, transferring hither their inherited animosities, amid which the\r\nIndians were ground as between two mill-stones.\r\n\r\n3. Upon the extinction of French dominion on the continent by the\r\nEnglish, the former red allies of the French, with secret prompting and\r\nhelp from the dispossessed party, were stirred with fresh animosities\r\nagainst the victors.\r\n\r\n4. Yet again the open hostilities of contending Indian tribes were\r\nlargely turned to account, to their own harm, in their respective\r\nalliances with the English colonies or with the mother-country in the\r\nWar of Independence.\r\n\r\n5. The closing period is that which is still in progress as covering\r\nthe relations with them of the United States government. The old\r\nhostilities between those tribes have been steadily of less account in\r\naffecting their later fortunes; and our government has not found it\r\nessential or expedient to aggravate its own severity against its Indian\r\nsubjects, or “wards,” by availing itself of the feuds between them.\r\n\r\nThe same antagonisms which had kept the Indian tribes in hostility\r\nwith each other prevented their effective alliance among themselves\r\nagainst the whites, and also embarrassed the English and French\r\nrivals, who sought to engage them on their respective sides. Many\r\nattempts were made by master chiefs among the savages, from the first\r\nintrusion of the Europeans, to organize combinations, or what we call\r\n“conspiracies,” of formerly contending tribes against the common foe.\r\nThe first of them, formidable though limited in its consequences, was\r\nmade in Virginia in 1622. Only two of these schemes proved otherwise\r\nthan wholly abortive. That of King Philip in New England, in 1675, was\r\neffective enough to show what havoc such a combination might work. That\r\nof Pontiac, in 1763, was vastly more formidable, and was thwarted only\r\nby a resistance which engaged at several widely severed points all the\r\nwarlike resources of the English. But the inherent difficulties, both\r\nof combining the Indian tribes among themselves, and of engaging some\r\nof them in alliance on either side with the French and the English\r\ncontestants, were vastly increased by the seeds of sharp dissension\r\nsown among them through the rivalries in trade and temptations offered\r\nin the fluctuating prices of peltries. Even the long-standing league of\r\nthe Five Nations was ruptured by the resolute English agent Johnson.\r\nHe succeeded so far as to secure a promise of neutrality from some of\r\nthem, and a promise of friendly help from one of them. There were some\r\nin each of the tribes falling not one whit behind the sharpest of the\r\nwhites in skilled sagacity and calculation, who were swift to mark and\r\nto interpret the changes in the balance of fortune, as one or the other\r\nof the parties of their common enemies made a successful stroke for\r\nascendency.\r\n\r\nThe facilities for alliance with one or another native tribe against\r\nits enemies made for the Europeans a vast difference in the results\r\nof their warfare with the aborigines. One might venture positively to\r\nassert that the occupancy of this continent by Europeans would have\r\nbeen indefinitely deferred and delayed had all its native tribes, in\r\namity with each other, or willing for the occasion to arrest their\r\nfeuds, made a bold and united front to resist the first intrusion upon\r\ntheir common domains. Certainly the full truth of this assertion might\r\nbe illustrated as applicable to many incidents and crises in the first\r\nfeeble and struggling fortunes of our original colonists in various\r\nexposed and inhospitable places. In many cases absolute starvation was\r\naverted only by the generous hospitality of the Indians. Taking into\r\nview the circumstances under which, from the first, tentative efforts\r\nwere made for a permanent occupancy by the whites on our whole coast\r\nfrom Nova Scotia to Florida, and along the lakes and great western\r\nvalleys, we must admit that their fortunes had more of peril than of\r\npromise. While, of course, we must refer their success and security in\r\nlarge measure to the forbearance, tolerance, and real kindliness of\r\nthe natives, yet it was well proved that as soon as the jealousy of\r\nthese natives was stirred at any threatened encroachment, only their\r\nown feuds disabled them from any united opposition, and gave to one or\r\nanother tribe the alternative of fighting the white intruders or of an\r\nalliance with them against their neighbor enemies. The whole series\r\nof the successive encroachments of Europeans on this continent is a\r\ncontinuous illustration of the successful turning to their own account\r\nof the strife of Indians against Indians. And when two rival European\r\nnationalities opened their two centuries of warfare for dominion on\r\nthis continent, each party at once availed itself of red allies ready\r\nto renew or prolong their own previous hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe French Huguenots in Florida and the Spaniards who massacred\r\nthem had each of them allies among the tribes which were in mutual\r\nhostility. Champlain was grievously perplexed by the pressure, to which\r\nnone the less he yielded, that if he would be in amity with the Hurons\r\nhe must espouse their deadly enmity with the Iroquois. Even the poor\r\nremnants of the tribe with which the Pilgrims of Plymouth made their\r\ntreaty of peace, which lasted for fifty years, were the vanquished and\r\ntributary representatives of a broken people. A sharp war and a more\r\ndeadly plague had made that colony a possibility.\r\n\r\nAnd so it comes to pass that, if we attempt to define at any period\r\nduring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the conflicts between\r\nthe savages and Europeans on this continent, we have to look for the\r\nexplanation of any special change in the relations of the Indian tribes\r\nto the varying interests and collisions of the different foreign\r\nnationalities in rivalry here. The hostilities between the French\r\nand the English were chronic and continuous. Frenchman’s Bay, at Mt.\r\nDesert, preserves the memorial of the first collision, when Argall,\r\nfrom Virginia, broke up the attempted settlement of Saussaye.[1340]\r\nAs to the later developments of the antagonism, resulting in the\r\nextinction of French possession here, we are to refer them in about\r\nequal measure to two main causes,—the jealousy of the home governments,\r\nand the keen rivalry of the respective colonists for the lucrative\r\nspoils of the fur trade. The profit of traffic may be regarded as\r\nfurnishing the prompting for strife on this side of the water, while\r\nthe passion for territorial conquest engaged the intrigues and the\r\narmies of foreign courts in the stakes of wilderness warfare.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the course of such warfare we must take into our view two\r\nvery effective agencies, which introduced important modifications\r\nin the methods and results of that warfare. In its progress these\r\ntwo agencies became more and more chargeable with very serious\r\nconsequences. The first of these is the change induced in the warfare\r\nof the Indians by their possession of, leading steadily to a dependence\r\nupon, the white man’s firearms and supplies. The second is the usage,\r\nwhich the Indians soon learned to be profitable, of reserving their\r\nwhite prisoners for ransom, instead of subjecting them to death or\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\nWhen we read of some of the earliest so-called “deeds” by which the\r\nEnglish colonists obtained from the sachems wide spaces of territory\r\non the consideration of a few tools, hatchets, kettles, or yards of\r\ncloth, we naturally regard the transaction as simply illustrating the\r\nwhite man’s rapacity and cunning in tricking the simplicity of the\r\nsavage. But we may be sure that in many such cases the Indian secured\r\nwhat was to him a full equivalent for that with which he parted. For,\r\nas the whites soon learned by experience, the savages supposed that\r\nin such transactions they were not alienating the absolute ownership\r\nof their lands, but only covenanting for the right of joint occupancy\r\nwith the English. And then the coveted tools or implements obtained by\r\nthem represented a value and a use not measurable by any reach of wild\r\nterritory. A metal kettle, a spear, a knife, a hatchet, transformed\r\nthe whole life of a savage. A blanket was to him a whole wardrobe.\r\nWhen he came to be the possessor of firearms and ammunition, having\r\nbefore regarded himself the equal of the white man, he at once became\r\nhis superior. We shall see how the rivalry between the French and\r\nthe English for traffic with the Indians, the enterprise of traders\r\nin pushing into the wilderness with pack-horses, the establishment\r\nof trucking houses, the facility with which the natives could obtain\r\ncoveted goods from either party, and the occasional failure of\r\nsupplies in the contingencies of warfare, were on many occasions the\r\nturning-points in the fights in the wilderness, and in the shifting of\r\nsavage partisanship from one side to the other, as the fickle allies\r\nfound their own interests at stake.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1609, when Champlain invaded the Iroquois country, on the\r\nlake that bears his name, that the astounded savages first saw the\r\nflash and marked the deadly effect of his arquebuse. But the shock soon\r\nspent itself. The weapon was found to be a terrestrial one, made and\r\nput to service by a man. The Dutch on the Hudson very soon supplied the\r\nMohawks with this effective instrument for prosecuting the fur trade.\r\nThe French began the general traffic with the Indians near the St.\r\nLawrence, in metal vessels, knives, hatchets, awls, cotton and woollen\r\ngoods, blankets, and that most coveted of all the white man’s stores,\r\nthe maddening “fire-water.” But farther north and west for full two\r\nhundred years, from 1670 quite down to our own time, annual cargoes of\r\nthese commodities were imported through Hudson Bay by the chartered\r\ncompany, and had been distributed by its agents among those who paid\r\nfor them in peltries, in such abundance that the savages became really\r\ndependent upon them, and gradually conformed their habits to the use of\r\nthem. Of course, in their raids upon English outposts, the spoils of\r\nwar in the shape of such supplies added rapacity to their ferocity. It\r\nwas with a proud flourish that Indian warriors, enriched by the plunder\r\non the field of Braddock’s disastrous defeat, strutted before the walls\r\nof Fort Duquesne, arrayed in the laced hats, sashes, uniform, and\r\ngorgets of British officers.\r\n\r\nWhen Céloron was sent, in 1749, by the governor of Canada, to take\r\npossession of interior posts along the Alleghanies, he found at\r\neach of the Indian villages, as at Logstown, a chief centre, from a\r\nsingle to a dozen English traders, well supplied with goods for a\r\nbrisk peltry traffic. He required the chiefs, on the threat of the\r\nloss of his favor, to expel them and to forbid their return. But the\r\nIndians insisted that they needed the goods. Some of these traders\r\nwere worthless reprobates, mostly Scotch-Irish, from the frontiers of\r\nPennsylvania. When Christopher Gist was sent, the next year, by the\r\nOhio Land Company, to follow Céloron and to thwart his schemes, he\r\ncomplained strongly of these demoralized and demoralizing traders. In\r\nthe evidence given before the British House of Commons on the several\r\noccasions when the monopoly and the mode of business of the Hudson\r\nBay Company were under question, the extent to which the natives had\r\ncome to depend upon European supplies was very strongly brought into\r\nnotice. It was urged that some of the tribes had actually, by disuse,\r\nlost their skill in their old weapons. It was even affirmed that in\r\nsome of the tribes multitudes had died by freezing and starvation,\r\nbecause their recent supplies had failed them. This dependence of the\r\nnatives upon the resources of civilization, observable from the opening\r\nof their intercourse with the whites, has been steadily strengthening\r\nfor two hundred years, till now it has become an absolute and heavy\r\nexaction upon our national treasury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe custom which soon came in, to soften the atrocities of Indian\r\nwarfare by the holding of white prisoners for ransom, was grafted upon\r\nan earlier usage among the natives of adopting prisoners or captives.\r\nThere was a formal ceremonial in such cases, and after its performance\r\nthose who would otherwise have been victims were treated with all\r\nkindness. The return of a war-party to its own village was attended\r\nwith widely different manifestations according to the fortune which\r\nhad befallen it. If it consisted only of a baffled and flying remnant\r\nthat had failed in its hazardous enterprise, its coming was announced,\r\nand received by the old men, women, and youths in the village with\r\nhowls and lamentations. If, however, it had been successful, as\r\nproved by rich plunder, reeking scalp-locks, and prisoners, some\r\nrunners were sent in advance to announce its approach. Then began a\r\nseries of orgies, in which the old squaws were the most demonstrative\r\nand hideous. While the scalp-locks were displayed and counted, the\r\nwell-guarded prisoners were exultingly escorted by their captors,\r\nthe squaws gathering around them with taunts and petty tormentings.\r\nThe woful fate which was waiting these prisoners was foreshadowed in\r\nprolonged rehearsals for its final horrors. One by one they were forced\r\nto run the gauntlet from goal to goal, between lines of yelping fiends,\r\nunder blows and missiles, stones, sticks, and tomahawks, while efforts\r\nwere made to trip them in their course, that they might be pounded in\r\ntheir helplessness when maddened with pain. Any exhibition of weakness\r\nor dread did but intensify the malignant frenzy of their tormentors.\r\nThose who lived through this ordeal, which was intended to be but a\r\npreliminary in the barbaric entertainment, and to stop short of the\r\nactual extinction of life, were afterwards, by deliberate preparations\r\nmade in full view of the prisoners, subjected to all the ingenuities\r\nof rage and cruelty which untamed savage fiendishness could devise.\r\nThe hero who bore the trial without flinching, singing his song of\r\ndefiance, and in his turn mocking his tormentors because they failed to\r\nbreak his spirit, was most likely to find mercy in a finishing stroke\r\ndealt by a magnanimous foe.\r\n\r\nAnything like an alleviation of these dread revenges of savage warfare\r\nbeing unallowable, there was open one way of complete relief in the\r\nusage of adoption, just referred to. This, however, was never available\r\nto the prisoner from his own first motion or prompting. He was wholly\r\npassive in the matter. It came solely from the inclination of any\r\none in the village, a warrior or a squaw who, having recently lost a\r\nrelative, or one whose service was necessary, might select a prisoner\r\nfrom the group as desirable to supply a place that was vacant. There\r\nwould seem to have been a large liberty allowed in the exercise of this\r\nprivilege, especially for those who were mourning for a relative lost\r\nin the encounter in which the prisoner was taken. Sometimes the merest\r\ncaprice might prompt the selection. Scarcely, except in the rare case\r\nof some proud captive who would haughtily scorn to avail himself of a\r\nseeming affinity with the tribe of a hated or abject enemy, would the\r\noffered privilege of adoption be refused. For, in any case, an ultimate\r\nescape from an enforced durance might be looked to. Of course those\r\nwho were thus adopted were mostly the young and vigorous. The little\r\nchildren were not especially favored in the process,—except, as soon to\r\nbe noted, the children of the whites. The ceremonial for adoption was\r\ntraditional. Beginning generally with somewhat rough and intimidating\r\ntreatment, the captive was for a while left in suspense as to his fate.\r\nWhen at length the intent of the arbiter of his life was made known to\r\nhim, the method pursued has been very frequently described to us in\r\ndetail by the whites who were the subjects of it.[1341] The candidate\r\nwas plunged and thoroughly soused in a stream to rinse out his white\r\nblood; the hair of his head, saving the scalp-lock, was plucked out;\r\nand after some mouthings and incantations, completing the initiation,\r\nall winning blandishments, arts, and appliances were engaged to secure\r\nthe confidence of the adopted captive, and to draw from him some\r\nresponsive sign of affection. He was arrayed in the choicer articles of\r\nforest finery, and nestled in the family lodge. The father, the squaw,\r\nor the patron, in whatever relation, to whom he henceforward belonged,\r\nspared no effort to engage and comfort him. Watchful eyes, of course,\r\njealously guarded any restless motions looking towards an escape. The\r\nfinal aim was to secure a fully nationalized and acclimated new member\r\nof a tribe, ready to share all its fortunes in peace and war.\r\n\r\nNaturally there were differences in this whole process and its results,\r\nas they concerned these attempted affiliations between the members of\r\nIndian tribes and in the adoption of white captives.[1342]\r\n\r\nIn their early conflicts with the whites, the Indians generally\r\npractised an indiscriminate slaughter. There were a few exceptions to\r\nthe rule in King Philip’s war.[1343] In the raids of the French, with\r\ntheir Indian allies, upon the English settlements, prisoners taken on\r\neither side came gradually to have the same status as in civilized\r\nwarfare, and to be held for exchange. This, however, would proceed\r\nupon the supposition that both parties had prisoners. But before there\r\nwas anything like equality in this matter, the captives were for the\r\nmost part such as had been seized from among the whites in inroads\r\nupon their settlements, not in the open field of warfare. A midnight\r\nassault upon some frontier cabins, or upon the lodge of some lonely\r\nsettler, left the savages to choose between a complete massacre or upon\r\na selection of some of their victims for leading away with them to\r\ntheir own haunts, if not too cumbersome or dangerous for the wilderness\r\njourney. It soon came to be understood among the raiding parties of\r\nIndians in alliance with the French in Canada that white captives had\r\na ransom value. Contributions were often gathered up in neighborhoods\r\nthat had been raided, and in the meeting-houses of New England on\r\nSundays, for redeeming such captives as were known to be in Canada.\r\nAnd, curiously enough, Judge Sewall in his journal records appeals for\r\ncharity in the same form for the redemption of captives in the hands of\r\nour own savages, and for the ransom of our seamen and traders who were\r\nkept in durance by African corsairs.\r\n\r\nIn the raids of desolation on either side of the Alleghanies and\r\nalong the sources of the Susquehannah and the Ohio, from the outbreak\r\nof the French and Indian war, down to and even after the crushing\r\nof Pontiac’s conspiracy, while more than a thousand cabins of the\r\nborderers were burned and their inmates mostly slaughtered, several\r\nhundred captives were borne off by the Indians and distributed among\r\ntheir villages. The ultimate fate of these captives always hung in\r\ndread uncertainty. If a panic arose among the lodges in apprehension\r\nof an onset from a war-party of the whites, the captives might be\r\nmassacred. But the force of circumstances and the urgency of interested\r\nmotives steadily made it an object for their captors to retain their\r\nprisoners unharmed, and even to make captivity tolerable to them.\r\nThe alternative of death or life to them generally depended upon\r\nwhether they might escape or be released by an avenging party without\r\ncompensation, or could be held for redemption through a ransom. The\r\nknowledge that the Indians retained such captives of course became a\r\nvery effective motive in inducing their relatives in the settlements\r\nto gather parties of neighbors for following the victims into the\r\nforest depths. Temporary truces also, when made by victorious parties\r\nof the whites, were conditioned upon the surrender of all their\r\nsurviving countrymen who were supposed to be in duress. The savages\r\npractised all their artifices and subterfuges in concealing some of\r\ntheir prisoners, alleging that they had been carried deeper into the\r\ncountry by new masters, or by positively denying all knowledge of their\r\nwhereabouts. But the persistency and threats of those who had learned\r\nhow to deal with these red diplomates, with a few resolute strokes\r\ngenerally brought about their surrender. When Bouquet had secured\r\npossession of Fort Duquesne with his army of 1,500 men, he stoutly\r\nfollowed up his success beyond the Ohio to the Indian settlements\r\nnear the Muskingum, and with his sturdy pluck and strong force he\r\noverawed the representatives of the neighboring tribes which he had\r\nsummoned to meet him. He insisted, as the first condition of a truce,\r\nupon the delivery of all the white prisoners secluded among them, not\r\nonly without the payment of any ransom, but upon their being brought\r\nin with a protecting escort and with means of sustenance. Of course\r\nthere was always ignorance or doubt as to the number of captives in any\r\nparticular place, and as to the hands into which any individual known\r\nor supposed to be in durance might have fallen. The word of an Indian\r\non these points was worthless unless backed by other testimony. A\r\nstimulating of the tongue into unguarded speech by a dram of rum might\r\nin some cases serve the purpose of the rack or the thumb-screw in more\r\ncivilized cross-examinations. An uncertainty of course always hung over\r\nthe survival or the whereabouts of individuals or members of a family\r\nwhose bodies had not been found on the scene of an Indian frontier\r\nraid. Bouquet was accompanied by friends and relatives of supposed\r\nsurvivors held in captivity as the spoils of some massacre, and these\r\nmight be depended upon to circumvent the falsehoods and cunning of\r\nthe captors, and to insist upon their giving up their prizes. The\r\npersistency and the plain evidence of resolved purpose manifested by\r\nBouquet finally compelled from the representatives of the tribes in\r\ncouncil a pledge to surrender all the prisoners in their hands, and\r\nmessengers were sent out to gather and bring them in, though with some\r\nplausible excuses for delay, and the grudging return of only a part of\r\nthem. But those who were given up became the best witnesses as to the\r\ndeception practised by the cunning culprits in holding back others.\r\nOnly after repeated exposures of falsehood by those so grudgingly\r\nsurrendered, asserting of their own knowledge that there were others\r\nheld in durance, whom they might even know by name, was there brought\r\nabout a full deliverance, saving that, whether truly or falsely, in\r\nthe case of a few individuals demanded the excuse was alleged that\r\nthey belonged to some chief or tribe absent at a distance on a hunt,\r\nand so not to be reached by a summons. Bouquet was also absolute in\r\nhis demand for all such white captives, young or old, as were alleged\r\nto have been adopted or married among the tribes. His firmly insisting\r\nupon this, and the compliance with it in many cases, led to some scenic\r\nmanifestations in the wilderness, of a highly dramatic character, full\r\nof the matter of romance in their revelations of the working of human\r\nnature under novel and strange conditions. Such manifestations often\r\nattended similar scenes in the ransom or forced surrender of whites who\r\nhad been in captivity among the Indians. But in this special instance\r\nof Bouquet’s resolute course with the Ohio tribes, numbers, variety,\r\npicturesqueness in those manifestations, gave to the bringing in and\r\nthe reception of captives features and incidents which strongly engage\r\nalike the sympathies and antipathies of human nature. Some of those\r\nbrought into Bouquet’s camp, who had once at least been whites, came\r\nwith full as much reluctance on their part as that which was felt by\r\nthose who gave them up. Indeed, several of them could be secured only\r\nby being bound and guarded.\r\n\r\nApproximation in all degrees to the manners and habits of Indian\r\nlife and to all the qualities of Indian nature had been realized by\r\nEuropeans from the first contact of the races on this continent. Of\r\ncourse the instances were numerous and very decisive in which this\r\napproximation was completed, and resulted in a substitution of all\r\nthe ways and habits of savagery for those of civilization. Many of\r\nthose who were forced back into Bouquet’s camp clung to their Indian\r\nfriends, and repelled all the manifestations of joy and affection of\r\ntheir own nearest kin by blood. They positively refused to return to\r\nthe settlements. They had been won by preference to the fascinations\r\nand license of a life in the wilderness. This preference was by no\r\nmeans inexplicable, even for some full-grown men and women who had\r\nbeen reared in the white settlements. Life in scattered cabins on the\r\nfrontiers had more points of resemblance than of difference in hard\r\nconditions and privations, when compared with savage life in the woods.\r\nSuch society as these scattered cabins afforded was rude and rough, all\r\nexperiences were precarious, daily drudgery was severe, the solitary\r\nhomes were gloomy, and only exceptional cases of early domestic and\r\nmental training alleviated the stern exigencies of the condition of the\r\nfirst generation of the settlers. For women and children especially,\r\nthe outlook and the routine of life were dismal enough. As for the\r\nmen, the more they conformed themselves in many respects to the actual\r\nhabits and resources of the Indians in the training of their instincts,\r\nin their garb, their food, their adaptation of themselves to the ways\r\nand resources of nature, the easier was their lot. Many women, likewise\r\nmade captives by the savages, in some cases of mature age, and having\r\nlooked forward to the usual lot of marriage, found an Indian to be\r\npreferable, or at all events tolerable, as a husband. Children who\r\npreserved but a faint remembrance of home and parents very readily\r\nadopted savage tastes, and testified by their shrieks and struggles\r\ntheir unwillingness to part from their red friends. Specimens from\r\neach of these classes were the most marked and demonstrative among\r\nthe groups brought in to Bouquet from Indian lodges, being in number\r\nmore than two hundred. Doubtless, however, the majority of them had\r\nhad enough of the experiences of savage life to make a return to the\r\nsettlements a welcome release. Such persons thenceforward constituted\r\na useful class as interpreters, mediators, and messengers between the\r\ncontending parties. Their knowledge of Indian character, superstitions,\r\nlimitations, weak and strong points, impulsive excitability,\r\nstratagems, and adaptability to circumstance proved on many emergent\r\noccasions of good account. Such of these returned captives as had had\r\nthe rudiments of an education, and were trustworthy as narrators, have\r\nmade valuable contributions to local history.\r\n\r\nAmong many such intelligent and trustworthy reporters was Col.\r\nJames Smith, captured on the borders of Pennsylvania in 1755, when\r\neighteen years of age, and kept in captivity five years. Another\r\nwas John McCullough, taken at about the same time and from the near\r\nneighborhood, when eight years old. He was retained eight years,\r\nand, being a quick-witted and observing youth, he kept his eyes and\r\nears open to all that he could learn. From such sources we derive\r\nthe most authentic information we possess of that transition period\r\nin the condition and fortunes of many of our aboriginal tribes when\r\nthe intrusion of Europeans upon them with their tempting goods and\r\ntheir rival schemes, which equally tended to dispossess them of their\r\nheritage, introduced among them so many novel complications. Some of\r\nthe narratives of the whites, who, under the conditions just referred\r\nto, lived for years and were assimilated with the Indians, present us\r\noccasionally by no means unattractive pictures of the ordinary tenor of\r\nlife among them. In the brief intervals of peace, and in some favored\r\nrecesses where game abounded and the changing seasons brought round\r\nfestivals, plays, and scenes of jollity, there were even fascinations\r\nto delight one of simple tastes, who could enjoy the aspects of nature,\r\nshare the easy tramp over mossy trails, content himself with the viands\r\nof the wilderness, employ the long hours of laziness in easy handiwork,\r\ndelight in basking beneath the soft hazes of the Indian summer, or\r\nlistening to the traditional lore of the winter wigwam. The forests\r\nvery soon began to be the shelter and the roving haunts of a crew of\r\nrenegades and outlaws from the settlements, who assimilated at all\r\npoints with the savages, and often used what remained to them of the\r\nknowledge and arts of civilization for ingenious purposes of mischief.\r\nIt has always proved a vastly more easy and rapid process for white men\r\nto fall back into barbarism than for an Indian to conform himself to\r\ncivilization. Wild life brought out all reversionary tendencies, and\r\nrevived primitive qualities and instincts. It gave those who shared it\r\na full opportunity to become oblivious of all fastidious tastes and\r\nof all the squeamishness of over-delicacy. The promiscuous contents\r\nof the camp-kettle, with its deposits and incrustations from previous\r\nbanquets, were partaken of with a zestful appetite. The circumstances\r\nof warfare in the woods quickened all the faculties of watchfulness,\r\nmade even the natural coward brave, imparted endurance, and multiplied\r\nall the ingenuities of resource and stratagem. There is something that\r\nsurpasses the merely marvellous in the feats of sturdy and persevering\r\nscouts, escaped captives, remnants of a butchery, messengers sent to\r\ncarry intelligence in supreme peril, and lonely wayfarers treading\r\nthe haunted forests, or creeping stealthily through ambushed defiles,\r\npenetrating marshes, using the sky and their woodcraft for guidance,\r\nfording or swimming choked or icy streams, climbing high tree-tops\r\nfor a wider survey from the closed woods and thickets, subsisting on\r\nroots and berries and moss, and yielding to the exhaustion of nature\r\nonly when all perils were passed and the refuge was reached. Alike on\r\nthe march of armies and in the siege of some little forest stronghold\r\nsurrounded by yelping savages, it was necessary from time to time to\r\nsend out a single plucky hero to carry or to obtain intelligence. When\r\nsuch a messenger was not designated by the commander, and the extremity\r\nof the emergency left the dismal honor to a volunteer, such was never\r\nfound to be lacking. It confounds all calculations of the law of\r\nchances to learn how, even in the majority of such dire enterprises as\r\nare on record, fortune favored the brave. Narratives there are which\r\nfor ages to come will gather all the exciting elements of tragedy and\r\nromance, and occasionally even of comedy, as, set down in the language\r\nof the woods, without the constraints of art or grammar, they make us\r\nfor the moment companions of some imperilled man or woman who borrowed\r\nof the bear, the deer, the fox, or the beaver, their several instincts\r\nand stratagems for outwitting pursuit and clinging to dear life. Rare,\r\nit may be, but still well authenticated, are cases of victims with a\r\nstrong tenacity of vitality, who, left as dead, mutilated and scalped,\r\nreasserted themselves when the foe had gone, found their way back to\r\ntheir homes, and, after such reconstruction as the art of the time\r\nwould allow, enjoyed a long life afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe conditions attending the entrance of European war-parties, with\r\ntheir necessary supplies, into the depths of the wilderness were of the\r\nmost severe and exacting character. They involved equally the outlay of\r\ntoil and an exposure to perils requiring the most watchful vigilance.\r\nWell-worn trails made by the natives, and always sufficiently travelled\r\nto keep them open, had long been in use for such purposes as were\r\nneeded in primitive conditions. These were very narrow, necessitating\r\nthat progress should be made through them singly, in “Indian file.”\r\nAt portages or carrying-places, burdens were borne on the back from\r\none watercourse to another, round a rapid or across an elevation.\r\nSome of these trails are even now traceable in the oldest settled\r\nportions of the country, where the woods have never been wholly\r\ncleared. Part of that which was availed of by the whites two hundred\r\nand fifty years ago between Plymouth and Boston, and others in untilled\r\nportions of the Old Colony, are clearly discernible. The thickets\r\nand undergrowths came close to the borders of these trails, and the\r\noverhanging branches of the trees were found a grievous annoyance when\r\nthe earliest traders with pack-horses traversed them. In a large part\r\nof our present national domain and in Canada, it may safely be said\r\nthat nineteen twentieths of all movement from place to place was made\r\nby the savages by the watercourses of lake and stream, and the same\r\nwas done by the Europeans till they brought into use horses first, and\r\nthen carts. These were first put to service by the traders from the\r\nEnglish settlements on the frontiers of Pennsylvania and Virginia. The\r\npack-horses, heavily laden, trained to their rough service for rocky\r\nand marshy grounds, as well as for the thick and stifling depths of\r\nthe forest, and able to subsist on very poor forage, carried goods\r\nmost prized by the natives, and generally in inverse ratio to their\r\nreal worth. They returned to the settlements from the Indian villages\r\nwith a burden of precious furs, the traffickers mutually finding\r\ntheir account in their respective shares in barter and profit. These\r\ntraders with their pack-horses were for a long time the pioneers of the\r\nactual settlers. The methods and results of their traffic, trifling\r\nas they may seem to be, had the two leading consequences of critical\r\nimportance: first, they made the Indians acquainted with and dependent\r\nupon the white man’s goods, and then they provoked and embittered\r\nthe rival competition between the French and the English for the\r\nconsiderable profits.\r\n\r\nWhat we now call a military road was first undertaken on a serious\r\nscale in the advance of the disastrous expedition of General\r\nBraddock, in 1755, over the Alleghanies to the forks of the Ohio.\r\nThe incumbrances with which he burdened himself might wisely have\r\nbeen greatly reduced in kind and in amount. But the exigencies of\r\nthe service in which he was engaged were but poorly apprehended by\r\nhim. As in the case of the even more disastrous campaign of General\r\nBurgoyne, twenty-two years later, (1777) though his route was mainly\r\nby water, the camp was lavishly supplied with appliances of luxury\r\nand sensuality. Braddock’s way for his cattle, carts, and artillery\r\nwas slowly and poorly prepared by pioneers in advance, levelling\r\ntrees, stiffening marshy places, removing rocks and bushes, and then\r\nleaving huge stumps in the devious track to rack the wagons and\r\ntorment the draught animals. It is not without surprise that we read\r\nof the presence of domestic cattle far off in the extreme outposts\r\nof single persevering settlers. But when, on the first extensive\r\nmilitary expeditions for building a fort on the shore of a lake, at\r\nriver forks, or to command a portage, we find mention of cannon and\r\nheavy ammunition, we marvel at the perseverance involved in their\r\ntransportation. The casks of liquor, of French brandy and of New\r\nEngland rum, which generally, without stint, formed a part of the\r\nstores of each military enterprise, furnished in themselves a motive\r\nspirit which facilitated their transport. Flour and bread could, with\r\nmany risks from stream and weather, be carried in sacks. But pork and\r\nbeef in pickle, the mainstay in garrisons which could not venture\r\nout to hunt or fish, required to be packed in wood. After all the\r\npersevering toil engaged in this transportation, the dire necessities\r\nof warfare under these stern conditions often compelled the destruction\r\nof the stores, every article of which had tasked the strained muscles\r\nand sinews of the hard-worked campaigners. When it was found necessary\r\nto evacuate a forest post, the stockade was set on fire, the magazine\r\nwas exploded, the cannon spiked, the powder thrown into the water, and\r\neverything that could not be carried off in a hasty retreat was, if\r\npossible, rendered useless as booty. As the French and English military\r\nmovements steadily extended over a wider territory and at more numerous\r\npoints, with increased forces, the waste and havoc caused by disasters\r\non either side involved an enormous destruction of the materials of\r\nwar. Vessels constructed with incredible labor on the lakes, anvils,\r\ncordage, iron, and artillery having been gathered for their building\r\nand arming by perilous ocean voyages and by transit through inner\r\nwaters and portages, and thousands of bateaux for Lakes Champlain and\r\nGeorge, now lie sunken in the depths, most of them destroyed by those\r\nin whose service they were to be employed. The “Griffin,” the first\r\nvessel on Lake Erie, built by La Salle in 1679, disappeared on her\r\nsecond voyage, and lies beneath the waters still. After Braddock’s\r\ndefeat, when the fugitive remnant of his army had reached Dunbar’s\r\ncamp, a hundred and fifty wagons were burned, and fifty thousand pounds\r\nof powder were emptied into a creek, after the incredible toil by which\r\nthey had been drawn over the mountains and morasses.\r\n\r\nThere were many occasions and many reasons which prompted the\r\nEuropeans to weigh the gain or loss which resulted to them from the\r\nemployment of Indian allies, who were always an incalculable element\r\nin any enterprise. They could never be depended upon for constancy or\r\npersistency. A bold stroke, followed, if successful, with butchery,\r\nand a rush to the covert of the woods if a failure, was the sum of\r\ntheir strategy. They had a quick eye in watching the turning fortunes\r\nand the probable issue of a venture, and they acted accordingly. They\r\nwere wholly disinclined for any protracted siege operations. In the\r\nweary months of the investment of Detroit, the only enterprise of\r\nthe sort engaged in by large bodies of savages acting in concert, we\r\nfind a single exceptional case of their uniform impatience of such\r\nprolonged strategy. And even in that case there were intervals when the\r\nimperilled and starving garrison had breathing-spells for recuperation.\r\nCharges and counter-charges, pleas and criminations of every kind,\r\nplausible, false, or sincere, are found in the journals and reports of\r\nEnglish and French officers, prompted by accusations and vindications\r\nof either party, called out by the atrocities and butcheries wrought\r\nby their savage allies in many of the conflicts of the French and\r\nIndian war. In vain did the commanders of the white forces on either\r\nside promise that their red allies should be restrained from plunder\r\nand barbarity against the defeated party. It was an attempt to bridle\r\na storm. From the written opinions expressed by various civil and\r\nmilitary officials during all our Indian wars one might gather a list\r\nof judgments, always emphatically worded, as to the qualities of the\r\nred men as allies. Governor Dinwiddie, writing in May 28, 1756, to\r\nGeneral Abercrombie, on his arrival here to hold the chief command\r\ntill the coming of Lord Loudon, expresses himself thus: “I think we\r\nhave secured the Six Nations to the Northward to our Interest who, I\r\nsuppose, will join your Forces. They are a very awkward, dirty sett of\r\nPeople, yet absolutely necessary to attack the Enemy’s Indians in their\r\nway of fighting and scowering the Woods before an Army. I am perswaded\r\nthey will appear a despicable sett of People to his Lordship and you,\r\nbut they will expect to be taken particular Notice of, and now and then\r\nsome few Presents. I fear General Braddock despised them too much,\r\nwhich probably was of Disservice to him, and I really think without\r\nsome of them any engagement in the Woods would prove fatal, and if\r\nstrongly attached to our Interest they are able in their way to do more\r\nthan three Times their Number. They are naturally inclined to Drink. It\r\nwill be a prudent Stepp to restrain them with Moderation, and by some\r\nof your Subalterns to shew them Respect.”[1344] Baron Dieskau, in 1755,\r\nhad abundant reason for expressing himself about his savage auxiliaries\r\nin this fashion: “They drive us crazy from morning to night. One needs\r\nthe patience of an angel to get on with these devils, and yet one must\r\nalways force himself to seem pleased with them.”[1345]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if the native tribes, when Europeans first secured a\r\nlodgment, were beguiled by a fancy which in most cases was very rudely\r\ndispelled. This fancy was that the new-comers might abide here without\r\ndisplacing them. The natives in giving deeds of lands, as has been\r\nsaid, had apparently no idea that they had made an absolute surrender\r\nof territory. They seem to have imagined that something like a joint\r\noccupancy was possible, each of the parties being at liberty to follow\r\nhis own ways and interests without molesting the other. So the Indians\r\ndid not move off to a distance, but frequented their old haunts, hoping\r\nto derive advantage from the neighborhood of the white man. King Philip\r\nin 1675 discerned and acutely defined the utter impracticability of any\r\nsuch joint occupancy. He indicated the root of the impending ruin to\r\nhis own race, and he found a justification of the conspiracy which he\r\ninstigated in pointing to the white man’s clearings and fences, and to\r\nthe impossibility of joining planting with hunting, and domestic cattle\r\nwith wild game.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Hudson Bay Company and that of the enterprises\r\nconducted by the French for more than a century, when set in contrast\r\nwith the steady development of colonization by English settlers and by\r\nthe people of the United States succeeding to them, brings out in full\r\nforce the different relations into which the aborigines have always\r\nbeen brought by the presence of Europeans among them, either as traders\r\nor possessors of territory. The Hudson Bay Company for exactly two\r\ncenturies, from 1670 to 1870, held a charter for the monopoly of trade\r\nwith the Indians here over an immense extent of territory, and in the\r\nlater portion of that period held an especial grant for exclusive trade\r\nover an even more extended region, further north and west. The company\r\nmade only such a very limited occupancy of the country, at small and\r\nwidely distant posts, as was necessary for its trucking purposes and\r\nthe exchange of European goods for peltries. During that whole period,\r\nallowing for rare casualties, not a single act of hostility occurred\r\nbetween the traders and the natives. A large number of different\r\ntribes, often at bitter feud with each other, were all kept in amity\r\nwith the official residents of the company, and each party probably\r\nfound as much satisfaction in the two sides of a bargain as is usual\r\nin such transactions. Deposits of goods were securely gathered in some\r\npost far off in the depths of the wilderness, under the care of two\r\nor three young apprentices of the company, and here bands of Indians\r\nat the proper season came for barter. Previous to the operations of\r\nthis company, beginning as early as 1620, large numbers of Frenchmen,\r\nsingly or in parties, ventured deep into the wilderness in company with\r\nsavage bands, for purposes of adventure or traffic, and very rarely did\r\nany of them meet a mishap or fail to find a welcome. Such adventurers\r\nin fact became in most cases Indians in their manner of life. Nor\r\ndid the jealousy of the savages manifest itself in a way not readily\r\nappeased when they found the French priests planting mission stations\r\nand truck-houses. In no case did the French intruders ask, as did the\r\nEnglish colonists, for deeds of territory. It was understood that\r\nthey held simply by sufferance, and with a view to mutual advantage\r\nfor both parties, with no purpose of overreaching. The relations thus\r\nestablished between the French and the natives continued down till even\r\nafter the extinction of the territorial claims of France. And when,\r\njust before the opening of the great French and Indian hostilities with\r\nthe English colonists, the French had manifested their purpose to get a\r\nfoothold on the heritage of the savages by pushing a line of strongly\r\nfortified posts along their lakes and rivers, the apprehensions of the\r\nsavages were craftily relieved by the plea that these securities were\r\ndesigned only to prevent the encroachment of the English.\r\n\r\nA peaceful traffic with the Indians, like that of the Hudson Bay\r\nCompany and the French, had been from the first but a subordinate\r\nobject of the English colonists. These last, while for a period they\r\nconfined themselves to the seaboard, supplemented their agricultural\r\nenterprise by the fishery and by a very profitable commerce. As soon\r\nas they began to penetrate into the interior they took with them their\r\nfamilies and herds, made fixed habitations, put up their fences and\r\ndammed the streams. Instead of fraternizing with the Indians, they\r\nwarned them off as nuisances. We must also take into view the fact\r\nthat this steadily advancing settlement of the Indian country directly\r\nprovoked and encouraged the resolute though baffled opposition of the\r\nsavages. They could match forces with these scattered pioneers, even\r\nif, as was generally the case, a few families united in constructing\r\na palisadoed and fortified stronghold to which they might gather\r\nfor refuge. If a body of courageous men had advanced together well\r\nprepared for common defence, it is certain the warfare would not have\r\nbeen so desultory as it proved to be. All the wiles of the Indians\r\nin conducting their hostilities gave them a great advantage. They\r\nthought that the whites might be dislodged effectually from further\r\ntrespasses if once and again they were visited by sharp penalties for\r\ntheir rash intrusion. It was plain that they were long in coming to a\r\nfull apprehension of the pluck of their invaders, of their recuperative\r\nenergies, and of the reserved forces which were behind them. From\r\nthe irregular base line of the coast the English advanced into the\r\ninterior, not by direct parallel lines, but rather by successive\r\nsemicircles of steadily extending radii. The advances from the middle\r\ncolonies of Pennsylvania and Virginia marked the farthest reaches in\r\nthis curvature. The French, in the mean while, aimed from the start for\r\noccupying the interior.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe period which we have here under review is one through which the\r\nsavages, for the most part, were but subordinate agents, the principals\r\nbeing the French and the English. So far as the diplomatic faculties of\r\nthe savages enabled them to hold in view the conditions of the strife,\r\nthere were doubtless occasions in which they thought they held what\r\namong civilized nations is called the balance of power. Nor would it\r\nhave been strange if, at times, their chiefs had imagined that, though\r\nit might be impossible for them again to hold possession of their old\r\ndomains free from the intrusion of the white man, they might have power\r\nto decide which of the two nationalities should be favored above the\r\nother. In that case the French doubtless would have been the favored\r\nparty. We have, however, to take into view the vast disproportion\r\nbetween the numbers, if not of the resources, of these two foreign\r\nnationalities, when the struggle between them earnestly began. In 1688\r\nthere were about eleven thousand of the French in America, and nearly\r\ntwenty times as many English. The French were unified under the control\r\nof their home government. Its resources were at their call: its army\r\nand navy, its arsenals and treasury, its monarch and ministers, might\r\nbe supposed to be serviceable and engaged for making its mastery on\r\nthis continent secure. The English, however, were only nominally, and\r\nas regards some of the colonies even reluctantly and but truculently,\r\nunder the control of their home government. It had been the jealous\r\npolicy of the New England colonists, from their first planting, to\r\nisolate themselves from the mother-country, and to make self-dependence\r\nthe basis of independence. Their circumstances had thrown them on their\r\nown resources, and made them feel that as their foreign superiors could\r\nknow very little of their emergencies, it was not wise or even right\r\nin them to interpose in their affairs. Indeed, it is evident that all\r\nthe British colonists felt themselves equal, without advice or help\r\nfrom abroad, to take care of themselves, if they had to contend only\r\nagainst the savages. But when the savages had behind them the power of\r\nthe French monarch, it was of necessity that the English should receive\r\na reinforcement from their own countrymen. In the altercations with the\r\nBritish ministry which followed very soon after the close of the French\r\nand Indian war, a keenly argued question came under debate as to the\r\nclaim which the mother-country had upon the gratitude of her colonists\r\nfor coming to their rescue when threatened with ruin from their red and\r\nwhite enemies. And the answer to this question was judged to depend\r\nupon whether, in sending hither her fleets and armies, Britain had\r\nin view an extension of her transatlantic domains or the protection\r\nof her imperilled subjects. At any rate, there were jealousies,\r\ncross-purposes, and an entire lack of harmony between the direct\r\nrepresentatives of English military power and the coöperating measures\r\nof the colonial government. Never, under any stress of circumstances,\r\nwas England willing to raise even the most serviceable of the officers\r\nof the provincial forces to the rank of regulars in her own army. The\r\nyouthful Washington, whose sagacity and prowess had proved themselves\r\nin field and council where British officers were so humiliated, had\r\nto remain content with the rank of a provincial colonel. Nor did the\r\nprovincial legislatures act in concert either with each other, or with\r\nthe advice and appeals of their royal governors in raising men, money\r\nor supplies for combined military operations against common enemies.\r\nEach of the colonies thought it sufficient to provide for itself. Each\r\nwas even dilatory and backward when its own special peril was urgent.\r\nThese embarrassments of the English did very much to compensate the\r\nFrench for their great inferiority in numerical strength. We are again\r\nto remind ourselves of the fact that the French, alike from their\r\ntemperament and their policy, were always vastly more congenial and\r\ninfluential with the savages.\r\n\r\nThe French in Canada from the first adopted the policy of alliance\r\nwith native tribes. Though their warfare with the English was hardly\r\nintermittent, there were several occasions when it was specially\r\nactive. Beginning with the first invasion of the Iroquois territory\r\nby Champlain, in 1609, already mentioned, under the plea of espousing\r\nthe side of his friends and allies, the Hurons and Algonquins, other\r\nlike enterprises were later pursued. Courcelles, in 1666, made a wild\r\nand unsuccessful inroad upon the Iroquois. Tracy made a more effective\r\none in the same year. De la Barre in 1684, Denonville in 1687, and\r\nFrontenac in 1693 and 1696, repeated these onsets. The last of these\r\ninvasions of what is now Central New York was intended to effect the\r\ncomplete exhaustion of the Indian confederacy. Its havoc was indeed\r\nwell-nigh crushing, but there was a tenacity and a recuperative power\r\nin that confederacy of savages which yielded only to a like desolating\r\nblow inflicted by Sullivan, under orders from Washington, in our\r\nRevolutionary War.\r\n\r\nThis formidable league of the Five Nations, when first known to\r\nEuropeans, claimed to have obtained by conquest the whole country from\r\nthe lakes to the Carolinas, and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi.\r\nFrance, as against other Europeans, though not against the Indians,\r\nclaimed the same territory. Great Britain claimed the valley of the\r\nOhio and its tributaries, first against the French as being merely the\r\nlongitudinal extension of the line of seacoast discovered by English\r\nnavigators, and then through cessions from and treaties with the Five\r\nNations. The first of these treaties was that made at Lancaster, Pa.,\r\nin June, 1744. But the Indians afterwards complained that they had been\r\noverreached, and had not intended to cede any territory west of the\r\nAlleghanies. Here, of course, with three parties in contention, there\r\nwas basis enough for struggles in which the prize, all considerations\r\nof natural justice being excluded, was to be won only by superior\r\npower. Neither of the rivals and intruders from across the ocean dealt\r\nwith the Indians as if even they had any absolute right to territory\r\nfrom which they claimed to have driven off former possessors. So the\r\nIndian prerogative was recognized by the French and the English as\r\navailable only on either side for backing up some rival claim of the\r\none or the other nation; though when the mother-countries were at peace\r\nin Europe, their subjects here by no means felt bound even to a show\r\nof truce, and they were always most ready to avail themselves of a\r\ndeclaration of war at home to make their wilderness campaigns. It is\r\ncurious to note that in all the negotiations between the Indians and\r\nEuropeans, including those of our own government, the only landed right\r\nrecognized as belonging to the savages was that of giving up territory.\r\nThe prior right of ownership by the tenure of possession was regarded\r\nas invalidated both by the manner in which it had been acquired and by\r\na lack to make a good use of it.\r\n\r\nIt was in the closing years of the seventeenth century and in\r\nthose opening the eighteenth that the military and the priestly\r\nrepresentatives of France in Canada resolutely advised and undertook\r\nthe measures which promised to give them a secure and extended\r\npossession of the whole north of the continent, excepting only the\r\nstrip on the Atlantic seaboard then firmly held by the English\r\ncolonists. Even this excepted region of territory was by no means,\r\nhowever, regarded as positively irreclaimable, and military enterprises\r\nwere often planned with the aim of a complete extinction of English\r\npossession. The French in their earliest explorations, in penetrating\r\nthe country to the west and to the south, had been keenly observant in\r\nmarking the strategic points on lake and river for strongholds which\r\nshould give them the advantage of single positions and secure a chain\r\nof posts for easy and safe communications. Their leading object was to\r\ngain an ascendency over the native tribes; and as they could not expect\r\neasily and at once to get the mastery over them all, policy dictated\r\nsuch a skilful turning to account of their feuds among themselves as\r\nwould secure strong alliances of interest and friendship with the more\r\npowerful ones. The French did vastly more than the English to encourage\r\nthe passions of the savages for war and to train them in military\r\nskill and artifice, leaving them for the most part unchecked in the\r\nindulgence of their ferocity. It is true that the Dutch and the English\r\nhad the start in supplying the savages with firearms, under the excuse\r\nthat they were needed by the natives for the most effective support of\r\nthe rapidly increasing trade in peltries. But the French were not slow\r\nto follow the example, as it presented to them a matter of necessity.\r\nAnd through the long and bloody struggle between the two European\r\nnationalities with their red allies, it may be safely affirmed that the\r\nfrontier warfare of the English colonists was waged against savages\r\narmed as well as led on by the French.\r\n\r\nTwo objects, generally harmonious and mutually helpful of each other,\r\ninspired the activity of the French in taking possession successively\r\nof posts in the interior of the continent. The first of these was the\r\nestablishment of mission stations for the conversion of the savages.\r\nThe other object of these wilderness posts was to secure the lucrative\r\ngains of the fur trade from an ever-extending interior. Though, as was\r\njust said, these two objects might generally be harmoniously pursued,\r\nit was not always found easy or possible to keep them in amity, or to\r\nprevent sharp collisions between them. There was a vigorous rivalry\r\nin the fur trade between the members of an associated company, with\r\na government monopoly for the traffic, and very keenly enterprising\r\nindividuals who pursued it, with but little success in concealing their\r\ndoings, in defiance of the monopolists. The burden of the official\r\ncorrespondence between the authorities in Canada and those at the\r\nFrench court related to the irregularities and abuses of this traffic.\r\nIncident to these was a lively plying of the temptations of that other\r\ntraffic which poured into the wilderness floods of French brandy. The\r\ntaste of this fiery stimulant once roused in a savage could rarely\r\nafterwards be appeased. The English colonists soon gained an advantage\r\nin this traffic in their manufacture of cheap rum. It is easy to see\r\nhow this rivalry between monopolists and individuals in the fur trade,\r\naided by the stimulant for which the Indian was most craving, would\r\nimpair the spiritual labors of the priests at their wild stations.\r\nNor were there lacking instances in which the priests themselves were\r\ncharged with sharing not only the gains of the fur trade, but also\r\nthose of the brandy traffic, either in the interests of the monopolists\r\nor of individuals.\r\n\r\nThe earliest extended operations of the French fur trade with the\r\nIndians were carried on by the northerly route to Lake Huron by\r\nthe Ottawa River. The French had little to apprehend from English\r\ninterference by this difficult route with its many portages. But it\r\nsoon became of vital necessity to the French to take and hold strong\r\npoints on the line of the Great Lakes. These were on the narrow streams\r\nwhich made the junctions between them. So a fort was to be planted at\r\nNiagara, between Ontario and Erie; another at Detroit, between Erie\r\nand Huron; another at Michilimackinac, between Michigan and Huron;\r\nanother at the fall of the waters of Superior into Huron; and Fort St.\r\nJoseph, near the head of Lake Michigan, facilitated communication with\r\nthe Illinois and the Miami tribes; the Ojibwas, Ottawas, Wyandots, and\r\nPottawattomies having their settlements around the westernmost of the\r\nlakes, the Sioux being still beyond. South of Lake Erie, in the region\r\nafterwards known as the Northwest Territory, between the Alleghanies,\r\nthe Ohio, and the Mississippi, were the Delawares, the Shawanees,\r\nand the Mingoes. It is to be kept in view that this territory,\r\nthough formally ceded by France to England in the treaty of 1762-63,\r\nhad previously been claimed by the English colonists as rightfully\r\nbelonging to their monarch, it being merely the undefined extension of\r\nthe seacoast held by virtue of the discovery of the Cabots.\r\n\r\nThe fifth volume of the _Mémoires_ published by Margry gives us the\r\noriginal documents, dating 1683-1695, relating to the first project\r\nfor opening a chain of posts to hold control of, and to facilitate\r\ncommunication between, Canada and the west and south of the continent.\r\nThe project was soon made to extend its purpose to the Gulf of Mexico.\r\nThe incursions of the Iroquois and the attempted invasions of the\r\nEnglish, with a consequent drawing off of trade from the French, had\r\nobliged the Marquis Denonville to abandon some of the posts that had\r\nbeen established. In spite of the opposition of Champigny, Frontenac\r\nvigorously urged measures for the repossession and strengthening of\r\nthese posts. The Jesuits were earnest in pressing the measure upon the\r\ngovernors of Canada. In pushing on the enterprise, the French had sharp\r\nexperience of the intense hostility of the inner tribes who were to be\r\nencountered, and who were to be first conciliated. The French followed\r\na policy quite unlike that of the English in the method of their\r\nnegotiations for the occupancy of land. The colonists of the latter\r\naimed to secure by treaty and purchase the absolute fee and ownership\r\nof a given region. They intended to hold it generally for cultivation,\r\nand they expected the Indians then claiming it to vacate it. The French\r\nbeguiled the Indians by asserting that they had no intention either of\r\npurchasing or forcibly occupying, as if it were their own, any spot\r\nwhere they established a stronghold, a trucking or a mission station.\r\nThey professed to hold only by sufferance, and that, too, simply for\r\nthe security and benefit of the natives, in furnishing them with a\r\nbetter religion than their own and with the white man’s goods. The\r\nIroquois, finding the hunting and trapping of game for the English so\r\nprofitable on their own territory, were bent on extending their field.\r\nThey hoped, by penetrating to Michilimackinac, to make themselves the\r\nagents or medium for the trade with the tribes near it, so that they\r\ncould control the whole southern traffic. So they had declared war\r\nagainst the Illinois, the Miamis, the Ottawas, and the Hurons. It was\r\nof vital importance to the French to keep firm hold of Lakes Ontario\r\nand Erie, and to guard their connections. The Iroquois were always the\r\nthreatening obstacle. It was affirmed that they had become so debauched\r\nby strong drink that their squaws could not nourish their few children,\r\nand that they had availed themselves of an adoption of those taken\r\nfrom their enemies. As they obtained their firearms with comparative\r\ncheapness from the English on the Hudson and Mohawk, they used them\r\nwith vigor against the inner tribes with their primitive weapons, and\r\nwere soon to find them of service against the English on the frontiers\r\nof Virginia. So keenly did the English press their trade as to cause a\r\nwavering of the loyalty of those Indian tribes who had been the first\r\nand the fast friends of the French. Thus it was but natural that the\r\nIroquois should be acute enough to oppose the building of a French\r\nstronghold at any of the selected posts.\r\n\r\nIn 1699,[1346] La Mothe Cadillac proposed to assemble their red\r\nallies, then much dispersed, and principally the Ottawas, at Detroit,\r\nand there to construct both a fort and a village. At the bottom of\r\nthis purpose, and of the opposition to it, was a contention between\r\nrival parties in the traffic. The favorers and the opponents of the\r\ndesign made their respective representations to the French court. De\r\nCallières objected to the plan because of the proximity of the hostile\r\nIroquois, who would prefer to turn all the trade to the English, and\r\nhis preference was to reëstablish the old posts. The real issue to be\r\nfaced was whether the Indians now, and ultimately, were to be made\r\nsubjects of the English or of the French monarch. Cadillac combated\r\nthe objections of Callières, and succeeded in effecting his design at\r\nDetroit. The extension of the traffic was constantly bringing into\r\nthe field tribes heretofore too remote for free intercourse. In each\r\nsuch case it depended upon various contingencies to decide whether the\r\nFrench or the English would find friends or foes in these new parties,\r\nand the alternative would generally rest, temporarily at least, upon\r\nwhich party was most accessible and most profitable for trade. It would\r\nhardly be worth the while for an historian, unless dealing with the\r\nspecial theme of the rivalries involved in the fur trade as deciding\r\nwith which party of the whites one or another tribe came into amity, to\r\nattempt to trace the conditions and consequences of such diplomacy in\r\ninconstant negotiators.\r\n\r\nThe English began the series of attempts to bind the Five, afterwards\r\nthe Six, Nations into amity or neutrality by treaty in 1674. These\r\ntreaties were wearisome in their formalities, generally unsatisfactory\r\nin their terms of assurance, and so subject to caprice and the\r\nchanges of fortune as to need confirmation and renewal, as suspicion\r\nor alleged treachery on either side made them practically worthless.\r\nThere were two ends to be gained by these treaties of the English with\r\nthe confederated tribes. The one was to avert hostilities from the\r\nEnglish and to secure them privileges of transit for trade. The other\r\nobject, not always avowed, but implied as a natural consequent of the\r\nfirst, was to alienate the tribes from the French, and if possible to\r\nkeep them in a state of local or general conflict. Each specification\r\nof these treaties was to be emphasized by the exchange of a wampum\r\nbelt. Then a largess of presents, always including rum, was the final\r\nratification. These goods were of considerable cost to the English, but\r\nalways seemed a niggard gift to the Indians, as there were so many to\r\nshare in them.\r\n\r\nThe first of this series of treaties was that made in 1674, at Albany,\r\nby Col. Henry Coursey, in behalf of the colonists of Virginia. It was\r\nof little more service than as it initiated the parties into the method\r\nof such proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of July, 1684, Lord Howard, governor of Virginia,\r\nsummoned a council of the sachems of the Five Nations to Albany. He\r\nwas attended by two of his council and by Governor Dongan of New York,\r\nand some of the magistrates of Albany. Howard charged upon the savages\r\nthe butcheries and plunderings which they had committed seven years\r\nprevious in Virginia and Maryland, “belonging to the great king of\r\nEngland.” He told the sachems that the English had intended at once to\r\navenge those outrages, but through the advice of Sir Edmund Andros,\r\nthen governor-general of the country, had sent peaceful messengers to\r\nthem. The sachems had proved perfidious to the pledges they then gave,\r\nand the governor, after threatening them, demanded from them conditions\r\nof future amity. After their usual fashion of shifting responsibility\r\nand professions of regret and future fidelity, the sachems renewed\r\ntheir covenants. Under the prompting of Governor Dongan they asked that\r\nthe Duke of York’s arms should be placed on the Mohawk castles, as a\r\nprotection against their enemies, the French. Doubtless the Indians, in\r\ndesiring, or perhaps only assenting to, the affixing of these English\r\ninsignia to their strongholds, might have had in view only the effect\r\nof them in warning off the French. They certainly did not realize that\r\ntheir English guests would ever afterwards, as they did, regard this\r\nconcession of the tribes as an avowal of allegiance to the king of\r\nGreat Britain, and as adopting for themselves the relation of subjects\r\nof a foreign monarch.\r\n\r\nThe experience gained by many previous attempts to secure the\r\nfidelity of the tribes, thenceforward known as the Six Nations by the\r\nincorporation into the confederacy of the remnant of the Tuscaroras,\r\nwas put to service in three succeeding councils for treaty-making, held\r\nrespectively at Philadelphia in 1742, in Lancaster, Pa., in 1744,[1347]\r\nand at Albany in 1746.[1348] Much allowance is doubtless to be made\r\nin the conduct of the earlier treaties for the lack of competent\r\nand faithful interpreters in councils made up of representatives of\r\nseveral tribes, with different languages and idioms. Interpreters have\r\nby no means always proved trustworthy, even when qualified for their\r\noffice.[1349] The difficulty was early experienced of putting into our\r\nsimple mother-tongue the real substance of an Indian harangue, which\r\nwas embarrassed and expanded by images and flowers of native rhetoric,\r\nwrought from the structure of their symbolic language, but adding\r\nnothing to the terms or import of the address. It was observed that\r\noften an interpreter, anxious only to state the gist of the matter in\r\nhand, would render in a single English sentence an elaborately ornate\r\nspeech of an orator that had extended through many minutes in its\r\nutterance. The orator might naturally mistrust whether full justice had\r\nbeen done to his plea or argument. There is by no means a unanimity\r\nin the opinions or the judgments of those of equal intelligence, who\r\nhave reported to us the harangues of Indians in councils, as to the\r\nqualities of their eloquence or rhetoric. The entire lack of terms\r\nfor the expression of abstract ideas compelled them to draw their\r\nillustrations from natural objects and relations. Signs and gestures\r\nmade up a large part of the significance of a discourse. Doubtless the\r\ncases were frequent in which the representation of a tribe in a council\r\nwas made through so few of its members that there might be reasonable\r\ngrounds for objection on the part of a majority to the terms of any\r\ncovenant or treaty that had been made by a chief or an orator. Of one\r\nvery convenient and plausible subterfuge, or honest plea,—whichever in\r\nany given case it might have been,—our native tribes have always been\r\nskilful in availing themselves. The assumption was that the elder, the\r\ngraver, wiser representatives of a tribe were those who appeared on its\r\nbehalf at a council. When circumstances afterwards led the whites to\r\ncomplain of a breach of the conditions agreed on, the blame was always\r\nlaid by the chiefs on their “young men,” whom they had been unable to\r\nrestrain.\r\n\r\nDuring the long term of intermittent warfare of the French and\r\nEnglish on this continent, with native tribes respectively for their\r\nfoes or allies, the conditions of the conflict, as before hinted,\r\nwere in general but slightly affected by the alternative of peace or\r\nwar as existing at any time between their sovereigns and people in\r\nEurope. Some of the fiercest episodes of the struggle on this soil\r\ntook place during the intervals of truce, armistice, and temporary\r\ntreaty settlements between the leading powers in the old world. When,\r\nin the treaties closing a series of campaigns, the settlement in the\r\narticles of peace included a restoration of the territory which had\r\nbeen obtained by either party by conquest, no permanent result was\r\nreally secured. These restitutions were always subject to reclamation.\r\nValuable and strategic points of territory merely changed hands for\r\nthe time being; Acadia, for example, being seven times tossed as a\r\nshuttlecock between the parties to the settlement. The trial had to\r\nbe renewed and repeated till the decision was of such a sort as to\r\ngive promise of finality. The prize contended for here was really the\r\nmastery of the whole continent, though the largeness of the stake was\r\nnot appreciated till the closing years of the struggle. Indeed, the\r\nbreadth and compass of the field were then unknown quantities. Those\r\nclosing years of stratagem and carnage in our forests correspond to\r\nwhat is known in history as the “Seven Years’ War” in Europe, in which\r\nFrance, as a contestant, was worsted in the other quarters of the\r\nglobe, as in this. Clive broke her power in India, as the generals of\r\nBritain discomfited her here. The French, in 1758, held a profitable\r\nmercantile settlement on five hundred miles of coast in Africa,\r\nbetween Cape Blanco and the river Gambia. It is one of the curious\r\ncontrarieties in the workings of the same avowed principles under\r\ndifferent conditions, that just at the time that the pacific policy of\r\nthe Pennsylvania Quakers forbade their offering aid to their countrymen\r\nunder the bloody work going on upon their frontiers, an eminent English\r\nQuaker merchant, Thomas Cumming, framed the successful scheme of\r\nconquest over this French settlement in Africa.[1350]\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, seemed to promise a\r\nbreathing-time in the strife between the French and English here.\r\nIn fact, however, so far from there being even a smouldering of the\r\nembers on our soil, that date marks the kindling of the conflagration\r\nwhich, continuing to blaze for fifteen years onward, comprehended\r\nall the decisive campaigns. The earliest of these were ominous and\r\ndisheartening to the English, but they closed with the fullness of\r\ntriumph. We must trace with conciseness the more prominent acts and\r\nincidents in which the natives, with the French and English, protracted\r\nand closed the strife.\r\n\r\nWhen Europeans entered upon the region now known as Pennsylvania,\r\nthough its well-watered and fertile territory and its abounding game\r\nwould seem to have well adapted it to the uses of savage life, it does\r\nnot appear that it was populously occupied. The Delawares, which had\r\nheld it at an earlier period, had, previously to the coming of the\r\nwhites, been subjugated by the more warlike tribes of the Five Nations,\r\nor Iroquois. Some of the vanquished had passed to the south or west, to\r\nbe merged in other bands of the natives. Such of them as remained in\r\ntheir old haunts were humiliated by their masters, despised as “women,”\r\nand denied the privileges of warriors. While the Five Nations were thus\r\npotent in the upper portion of Pennsylvania, around the sources of the\r\nSusquehanna, its southern region was held by the Shawanees. The first\r\npurchase near the upper region made by Europeans of the natives was by\r\na colony of Swedes, under Governor John Printz, in 1643. This colony\r\nwas subdued, though allowed to remain on its lands, by the Dutch, in\r\n1655. In 1664, the English took possession of all Pennsylvania, and of\r\neverything that had been held by the Dutch. Penn founded his province\r\nin 1682, by grant from Charles II., and in the next year made his\r\nmuch-lauded treaty of peace and purchase with the Indians for lands\r\nwest and north of his city. The attractions of the province, and the\r\neasy opening of its privileges to others than the Friends, drew to it a\r\nrapid and enterprising immigration. In 1729 there came in, principally\r\nfrom the north of Ireland, 6,207 settlers. In 1750 there arrived 4,317\r\nGermans and 1,000 English. The population of the province in 1769 was\r\nestimated at 250,000. The Irish settlers were mostly Presbyterians,\r\nthe Germans largely Moravians. It soon appeared, especially when the\r\nravages of the Indians on the frontiers were most exasperating and\r\ndisastrous, that there were elements of bitter discord between these\r\nsecondary parties in the province and the Friends who represented the\r\nproprietary right. And this suggests a brief reference to the fact\r\nthat, as a very effective agent entering into the imbittered conflicts\r\nof the time and scene, we are to take into the account some strong\r\nreligious animosities. The entailed passions and hates of the peoples\r\nof the old world, as Catholics and Protestants, and even of sects among\r\nthe latter, were transferred here to inflame the rage of combatants in\r\nwilderness warfare.[1351] The zeal and heroic fidelity of the French\r\npriests in making a Christian from a baptized and untamed savage had\r\nrealized, under rude yet easy conditions, a degree of success. In and\r\nnear the mission stations, groups of the natives had been trained to\r\ngather around the cross, and to engage with more or less response in\r\nthe holy rites. Some of them could repeat, after a fashion, the Pater\r\nNoster, the Ave Maria, and the Creed. Some had substituted a crucifix\r\nor a consecrated medal for their old pagan charm, to be worn on the\r\nbreast. When about to go forth on the war-path, their priests would\r\ngive them shrift and benediction. But, as has been said, it was no\r\npart or purpose of this work of christianizing savages to impair their\r\nqualities as warriors, to dull their knives or tomahawks, to quench\r\ntheir thirst for blood, or to restrain the fiercest atrocities and\r\nbarbarities of the fight or the victory. On the well-known experience\r\nthat fresh converts are always the most ardent haters of heresy, these\r\nsavage neophytes were initiated into some of the mysteries of the\r\ndoctrinal strife between the creed of their priests and the abominated\r\ninfidelity and impiety of the English Protestants. Some of the savages\r\nwere by no means slow to learn the lesson. Mr. Parkman’s brilliant\r\nand graphic pages afford us abounding illustrations of the part which\r\npriestly instructions and influence had in adding to savage ferocity\r\nthe simulation of religious hate for heresy. With whatever degree of\r\nunderstanding or appreciation of the duty as it quickened the courage\r\nor the ferocity of the savage, there were many scenes and occasions in\r\nwhich the warrior added the charge of heretic to that of enemy, when he\r\ndealt his blow.[1352]\r\n\r\nAlmost as violent and exasperating were the animosities engendered\r\nbetween the disciples of different Protestant fellowships. The Quakers,\r\nbacked by proprietary rights, by the prestige of an original peace\r\npolicy and friendly negotiations with the Indians, and for the most\r\npart secure and unharmed in the centralized homes of Philadelphia and\r\nits neighborhood, imagined that they might refuse all participation\r\nin the bloody work enacting on their frontiers. The adventurous\r\nsettlers on the borders were largely Presbyterians. The course of\r\nnon-interference by the Quakers, who controlled the legislature, seemed\r\nto those who were bearing the brunt of savage warfare monstrously\r\nselfish and inhuman. There was a fatuity in this course which had to be\r\nabandoned. When a mob of survivors from the ravaged fields and cabins\r\nof the frontiers, bringing in cartloads of the bones gathered from the\r\nashes of their burned dwellings, thus enforced their remonstrances\r\nagainst the peace policy of the legislature, the Quakers were compelled\r\nto yield, and to furnish the supplies of war.[1353] But sectarian\r\nhatred hardly ever reached an intenser glow than that exhibited between\r\nthe Pennsylvania Quakers and Presbyterians. Meanwhile, the mild and\r\nkindly missionary efforts of the Moravians, in the same neighborhood,\r\nwere cruelly baffled. Their aim was exactly the opposite of that which\r\nguided the Jesuit priests. They sought first to make their converts\r\nhuman beings, planters of the soil, taught in various handicrafts, and\r\nweaned from the taste of war and blood.\r\n\r\nWhen the frontier war was at its wildest pitch of havoc and fury, the\r\nMoravian settlements, which had reached a stage giving such promise of\r\nsuccess as to satisfy the gentle and earnest spirit of the missionaries\r\nwho had planted them, were made to bear the brunt of the rage of\r\nall the parties engaged in the deadly turmoil. The natives timidly\r\nnestling in their settlements were regarded as an emasculated flock of\r\nnurslings, mean and cowardly, lacking equally the manhood of the savage\r\nand the pride and capacity of the civilized man. Worse than this,\r\ntheir pretended desire to preserve a neutrality and to have no part\r\nin the broil was made the ground of a suspicion, at once acted upon\r\nas if fully warranted, that they were really spies, offering secret\r\ninformation and even covert help as guides and prompters in the work\r\nof desolation among the scattered cabins of the whites. So a maddened\r\nspirit of distrust, inflamed by false rumors and direct charges of\r\ncomplicity, brought upon the Moravian settlers the hate and fury of the\r\nleading parties in the conflict.[1354]\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the most furious havoc of savage warfare should\r\nhave been wreaked on the frontiers of Pennsylvania, the one of all the\r\nEnglish colonies in America whose boast was, and is, that there alone\r\nthe entrance of civilized men upon the domains of barbarism was marked\r\nand initiated by the Christian policy of peace and righteousness. Penn\r\nand his representatives claimed that they had twice paid the purchase\r\nprice of the lands covered by the proprietary charter to the Indian\r\noccupants of them,—once to the Delawares residing upon them, and\r\nagain to the Iroquois who held them by conquest. The famous “Walking\r\nPurchase,” whether a fair or a fraudulent transaction, was intended to\r\nfollow the original policy of the founder of the province.[1355]\r\n\r\nIn the inroads made upon the English settlements by Frontenac and\r\nhis red allies, New York and New England furnished the victims. The\r\nmiddle colonies, so far as then undertaken, escaped the fray. Trouble\r\nbegan for them in 1716, when the French acted upon their resolve to\r\noccupy the valley of the Ohio. The Ohio Land Company was formed in\r\n1748 to advance settlements beyond the Alleghanies, and surveys were\r\nmade as far as Louisville. This enterprise roused anew the Indians and\r\nthe French. The latter redoubled their zeal in 1753 and onward, south\r\nof Lake Erie and on the branches of the Ohio. The English found that\r\ntheir delay and dilatoriness in measures for fortifying the frontiers\r\nhad given the French an advantage which was to be recovered only with\r\nincreased cost and enterprise. In an earlier movement, had the English\r\nengaged their efforts when it was first proposed to them, they might\r\nhave lessened, at least, their subsequent discomfiture. Governor\r\nSpotswood, of Virginia, in 1720 had urged on the British government the\r\nerection of a chain of posts beyond the Alleghanies, from the lakes to\r\nthe Mississippi. But his urgency had been ineffectual. The governor\r\nreported that there were then “Seven Tributary Tribes” in Virginia,\r\nbeing seven hundred in number, with two hundred and fifty fighting-men,\r\nall of whom were peaceful. His only trouble was from the Tuscaroras on\r\nthe borders of Carolina.[1356]\r\n\r\nThe erection of Fort Duquesne may be regarded as opening the decisive\r\nstruggle between the French and the English in America, which reached\r\nits height in 1755, and centred around the imperfect chain of stockades\r\nand blockhouses on the line of the frontiers then reached by the\r\nEnglish pioneers.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the eighteenth century the number of French\r\nsubjects in America, including Acadia, Canada, and Louisiana, was\r\nestimated at about eighty thousand. The subjects of England were\r\nestimated at about twelve hundred thousand. But, as before remarked,\r\nthis vast disparity of numbers by no means represented an equal\r\ndifference in the effectiveness of the two nationalities in the conduct\r\nof military movements. The French were centralized in command. They\r\nhad unity of purpose and in action. In most cases they held actual\r\ndefensive positions at points which the English had to reach by\r\ndifficult approaches; and more than all, till it became evident that\r\nFrance was to lose the game, the French received much the larger share\r\nof aid from the Indians. Pennsylvania and Virginia were embarrassed in\r\nany attempt for united defensive operations on the frontiers by their\r\nown rival claims to the Ohio Valley. The English, however, welcomed\r\nthe first signs of vacillation in the savages. When Céloron, in 1749,\r\nhad sent messengers to the Indians beyond the Alleghanies to prepare\r\nfor the measures he was about to take to secure a firm foothold there,\r\nhe reported that the natives were “devoted entirely to the English.”\r\nThis might have seemed true of the Delawares and Shawanees, though\r\nsoon afterwards these were found to be in the interest of the French.\r\nIn fact, all the tribes, except the Five Nations, may be regarded as\r\nmore or less available for French service up to the final extinction of\r\ntheir power on the continent. Indeed, as we shall see, the mischievous\r\nenmity of the natives against the English was never more vengeful than\r\nwhen it was goaded on by secret French agency after France had by\r\ntreaty yielded her claims on this soil. Nor could even the presumed\r\nneutrality of the Five Nations be relied upon by the English, as there\r\nwere reasons for believing that many among them acted as spies and\r\nconveyed intelligence. Till after the year 1754 so effective had been\r\nthe activity of the French in planting their strongholds and winning\r\nover the savages that there was not a single English post west of the\r\nAlleghanies.\r\n\r\nAt the same critical stage of this European rivalry in military\r\noperations, the greed for the profits of the fur trade was at its\r\nhighest pitch. The beavers, as well as the red men, should be regarded\r\nas essential parties to the struggle between the French and the\r\nEnglish. The latter had cut very deep into the trade which had formerly\r\naccrued wholly to the French at Oswego, Toronto, and Niagara.\r\n\r\nUp to the year 1720 there had come to be established a mercantile\r\nusage which had proved to be very prejudicial to the English, alike\r\nin their Indian trade and in their influence over the Indians. The\r\nFrench had been allowed to import goods into New York to be used for\r\ntheir Indian trade. Of course this proved a very profitable business,\r\nas it facilitated their operations and was constantly extending over\r\na wider reach their friendly relations with the farther tribes. Trade\r\nwith Europe and the West Indies and Canada could be maintained only\r\nby single voyages in a year, through the perilous navigation of the\r\nSt. Lawrence. With the English ports on the Atlantic, voyages could\r\nbe made twice or thrice a year. A few merchants in New York, having\r\na monopoly of supplying goods to the French in Canada, with their\r\nprincipals in England, had found their business very profitable. Goods\r\nof prime value, especially “strouds,” a kind of coarse woollen cloth\r\nhighly prized by the Indians, were made in and exported from England\r\nmuch more cheaply than from France. The mischief of this method of\r\ntrade being realized, an act was passed by the Assembly in New York, in\r\n1720, which prohibited the selling of Indian goods to the French under\r\nsevere penalties, in order to the encouragement of trade in general,\r\nand to the extension of the influence of the English over the Indians\r\nto counterbalance that of the French. Some merchants in London, just\r\nreferred to, petitioned the king against the ratification of this act.\r\nBy order in council the king referred the petition to the Lords of\r\nTrade and Plantations. A hearing, with testimonies, followed, in which\r\nthose interested in the monopoly made many statements, ignorant or\r\nfalse, as to the geography of the country, and the method and effects\r\nof the advantage put into the hands of the French. But the remonstrants\r\nfailed to prevent the restricting measure. From that time New York\r\nvastly extended its trade and intercourse with the tribes near and\r\ndistant, greatly to the injury of the French.[1357]\r\n\r\nThe first white man’s dwelling in Ohio was that of the Moravian\r\nmissionary, Christian Frederic Post.[1358] He was a sagacious and able\r\nman, and had acquired great influence over the Indians, which he used\r\nin conciliatory ways, winning their respect and confidence by the\r\nboldness with which he ventured to trust himself in their villages and\r\nlodges, as if he were under some magical protection. He went on his\r\nfirst journey to the Ohio in 1758, by request of the government of\r\nPennsylvania, on a mission to the Delawares, Shawanees, and Mingoes.\r\nThese had once been friendly to the English, but having been won over\r\nby the French, the object was to regain their confidence. The tribes\r\nhad at this time come to understand, in a thoroughly practical way,\r\nthat they were restricted to certain limited conditions so far as they\r\nwere parties to the fierce rivalry between the Europeans. The issue was\r\nno longer an open one as to their being able to reclaim their territory\r\nfor their own uses by driving off all these pale-faced trespassers.\r\nIt was for them merely to choose whether they would henceforward have\r\nthe French or the English for neighbors, and, if it must be so, for\r\nmasters. Nor were they left with freedom or power to make a deliberate\r\nchoice. But Post certainly stretched a point when he told the Indians\r\nthat the English did not wish to occupy their lands, but only to drive\r\noff the French.\r\n\r\nAs Governor Spotswood, in the interest of Virginia, had attempted, in\r\n1716, to break the French line of occupation by promoting settlements\r\nin the west, Governor Keith, of Pennsylvania, followed with a similar\r\neffort in 1719. Both efforts could be only temporarily withstood, and\r\nif baffled at one point were renewed at another. The English always\r\nshowed a tenacity in clinging to an advance once made, and were\r\ninclined to change it only for a further advance. Though Fort Duquesne\r\nwas blown up when abandoned by the French, with the hope of rendering\r\nit useless to the English, the post was too commanding a one to be\r\nneglected. After it had been taken by General Forbes in November,\r\n1758, and had been strongly reconstructed by General Stanwix, though\r\nit was then two hundred miles distant from the nearest settlement,\r\nthe possession of it was to a great extent the deciding fact of the\r\nadvancing struggle. Colonel Armstrong had taken the Indian town of\r\nKittanning in 1756.\r\n\r\nThe treaty negotiations between English and French diplomates at\r\na foreign court, in 1763, which covenanted for the surrender of all\r\nterritory east of the Mississippi and of all the fortified posts on\r\nlake and river to Great Britain, was but a contract on paper, which\r\nwas very long in finding its full ratification among the parties alone\r\ninterested in the result here. There were still three of these parties:\r\nthe Indians; the French, who were in possession of the strongholds in\r\nthe north and west; and the English colonists, supported by what was\r\nleft of the British military forces, skeleton regiments and invalided\r\nsoldiers, who were to avail themselves of their acquired domain. During\r\nthe bloody and direful war which had thus been closed, the Indians had\r\ncome to regard themselves as holding the balance of power between the\r\nFrench and the English. Often did the abler savage warriors express\r\nalike their wonder and their rage that those foreign intruders should\r\nchoose these wild regions for the trial of their fighting powers. “Why\r\ndo you not settle your fierce quarrels in your own land, or at least\r\nupon the sea, instead of involving us and our forests in your rivalry?”\r\nwas the question to the officers and the file of the European forces.\r\nThough the natives soon came to realize that they would be the losers,\r\nwhichever of the two foreign parties should prevail, their preferences\r\nwere doubtless on the side of the French; and by force of circumstances\r\neasily explicable, after the English power, imperial and provincial,\r\nhad obtained the mastery of the territory, the sympathies and aid of\r\nthe natives went with the British during the rebellion of the colonies.\r\nBut before this result was reached England won its ascendency at a\r\nheavy sacrifice of men and money, in a series of campaigns under many\r\ndifferent generals. The general peace between England, France, and\r\nSpain, secured by the treaty of 1763, and involving the cession of\r\nall American territory east of the Mississippi by France to Britain,\r\nwas naturally expected to bring a close to savage warfare against the\r\ncolonists. The result was quite the contrary, inasmuch as the sharpest\r\nand most desolating havoc was wrought by that foe after the English\r\nwere nominally left alone to meet the encounter. The explanation of\r\nthis fact was that the French, though by covenant withdrawn from the\r\nfield, were, hardly even with a pretence of secrecy, perpetuating\r\nand even extending their influence over their former wild allies in\r\nembarrassing and thwarting all the schemes of the English for turning\r\ntheir conquests to account. General Amherst was left in command here\r\nwith only enfeebled fragments of regiments and with slender ranks of\r\nprovincials. The military duty of the hour was for the conquerors\r\nto take formal possession of all the outposts still held by French\r\ngarrisons, announcing to those in command the absolute conditions\r\nof the treaty, and to substitute the English for the French colors,\r\nhenceforward to wave over them. This humiliating necessity was in\r\nitself grievous enough, as it forced upon the commanders of posts which\r\nhad not then been reached by the war in Canada, a condition against\r\nwhich no remonstrance would avail. But beyond that, it furnished the\r\noccasion for the most formidable savage conspiracy ever formed on\r\nthis continent, looking to the complete extinction of the English\r\nsettlements here. The French in those extreme western posts had been\r\nmost successful in securing the attachment of the neighboring Indian\r\ntribes, and found strong sympathizers among them in their discomfiture.\r\nAt the same time those tribes had the most bitter hostility towards the\r\nEnglish with whom they had come in contact. They complained that the\r\nEnglish treated them with contempt and haughtiness, being niggard of\r\ntheir presents and sharp in their trade. They regarded each advanced\r\nEnglish settlement on their lands, if only that of a solitary trader,\r\nas the germ of a permanent colony. Under these circumstances, the\r\nFrench still holding the posts, waiting only the exasperating summons\r\nto yield them up, found the temptation strong and easy of indulgence to\r\ninflame their recent allies, and now their sympathizing friends, among\r\nthe tribes, with an imbittered rage against their new masters. Artifice\r\nand deception were availed of to reinforce the passions of savage\r\nbreasts. The French sought to relieve the astounded consternation of\r\ntheir red friends on finding that they were compelled to yield the\r\nfield to the subjects of the English monarch, by beguiling them with\r\nthe fancy that the concession was but a temporary one, very soon to be\r\nset aside by a new turn in the wheel of fortune. Their French father\r\nhad only fallen asleep while his English enemies had been impudently\r\ntrespassing upon the lands of his red children. He would soon rouse\r\nhimself to avenge the insult, and would reclaim what he had thus\r\nlost. Indeed, on the principle that the size and ornamentings of a\r\nlie involved no additional wrong in the telling it, the Indians were\r\ninformed that a French army was even then preparing to ascend the\r\nMississippi with full force, before which the English would be crushed.\r\n\r\nThere was then in the tribe of Ottawas, settled near Detroit, a master\r\nspirit, who, as a man and as a chief, was the most sagacious, eloquent,\r\nbold, and every way gifted of his race that has ever risen before the\r\nwhite man on this continent to contest in the hopeless struggle of\r\nbarbarism with civilization. That Pontiac was crafty, unscrupulous,\r\nrelentless, finding a revel in havoc and carnage, might disqualify him\r\nfor the noblest epithets which the white man bestows on the virtues\r\nof a military hero. But he had the virtues of a savage, all of them,\r\nand in their highest range of nature and of faculty. He was a stern\r\nphilosopher and moralist also, of the type engendered by free forest\r\nlife, unsophisticated and trained in the school of the wilderness. He\r\nknew well the attractions of civilization. He weighed and compared\r\nthem, as they presented themselves before his eyes in full contrast\r\nwith savagery, in the European and in the Indian, and in those dubious\r\nspecimens of humanity in which the line of distinction was blurred by\r\nthe Indianized white man, the “Christian” convert, and the half-breed.\r\nDeliberately and, we may say, intelligently, he preferred for his own\r\npeople the state of savagery. Intelligently, because he gave grounds\r\nfor his preference, which, from his point of view and experience,\r\nhad weight in themselves, and cannot be denied something more than\r\nplausibility even in the judgment of civilized men, for idealists\r\nlike Rousseau and the Abbé Raynal have pleaded for them. Pontiac was\r\nolder in native sagacity and shrewdness than in years. He had evidence\r\nenough that his race had suffered only harm from intercourse with\r\nthe whites. The manners and temptations of civilization had affected\r\nthem only by demoralizing influences. All the elements of life in the\r\nwhite man struck at what was noblest in the nature of the Indian,—his\r\nvirility, his self-respect, his proud and sufficing independence,\r\nhis content with his former surroundings and range of life. With an\r\nearnest eloquence Pontiac, in the lodges and at the council fires of\r\nhis people, whether of his own immediate tribe or of representative\r\nwarriors of other tribes, set before them the demonstration that\r\nsecurity and happiness, if not peace, depended for them on their\r\nrenouncing all reliance upon the white man’s ways and goods, and\r\nreverting with a stern stoicism to the former conditions of their lot.\r\nHe told his responsive listeners that the Great Spirit, in pouring\r\nthe wide salt waters between the two races of his children, meant to\r\ndivide them and to keep them forever apart, giving to each of them a\r\ncountry which was their own, where they were free to live after their\r\nown method. The different tinting of their skin indicated a variance\r\nwhich testified to a rooted divergence of nature. For his red children\r\nthe Great Spirit had provided the forest, the meadow, the lake, and\r\nthe river, with fish and game for food and clothing. The canoe, the\r\nmoccasin, the snow-shoe, the stone axe, the hide or bark covered lodge,\r\nthe fields of golden maize, the root crops, the vines and berries,\r\nthe waters of the cold crystal spring, made the inventory of their\r\npossessions. They belonged to nature, and were of kin to all its other\r\ncreatures, which they put freely to their use, holding everything in\r\ncommon. The changing moons brought round the seasons for planting\r\nand hunting, for game, festivity, and religious rite. Their old men\r\npreserved the sacred traditions of their race. Their braves wore the\r\nscars and trophies of a noble manhood, and their young men were in\r\ntraining to be the warriors of their tribes in defence or conquest.\r\n\r\nThese, argued Pontiac, were the heritage which the Great Spirit had\r\nassigned to his red children. The spoiler had come among them from\r\nacross the salt sea, and woe and ruin for the Indian had come with him.\r\nThe white man could scorn the children of the forest, but could not be\r\ntheir friend or helper. Let the Indian be content and proud to remain\r\nan Indian. Let him at once renounce all use of the white man’s goods\r\nand implements and his fire-water, and fall back upon the independence\r\nof nature, fed on the flesh and clothed with the skins secured by bow\r\nand arrow and his skill of woodcraft.\r\n\r\nSuch was the pleading of the most gifted chieftain and the wisest\r\npatriot, the native product of the American wilderness. There was a\r\nnobleness in him, even a grandeur and prescience of soul, which take a\r\nplace now on the list of protests that have poured from human breasts\r\nagainst the decrees of fate. Pontiac followed up his bold scheme by all\r\nthe arts and appliances of forest diplomacy. He formed his cabinet, and\r\nsent out his ambassadors with their credentials in the reddened hatchet\r\nand the war-belt. They visited some of even the remoter tribes, with\r\nappeals conciliatory of all minor feuds and quarrels. Their success\r\nwas qualified only by the inveteracy of existing enmities among some\r\nof these tribes. It would be difficult to estimate, even if only\r\napproximately, the number of the savages who were more or less directly\r\nengaged in the conspiracy of Pontiac. A noted French trader, who had\r\nresided many years among the Indians, and who had had an extended\r\nintercourse with the tribes, stayed at Detroit during the siege, having\r\ntaken the oath of allegiance to the king of Great Britain. Largely\r\nfrom his own personal knowledge, he drew up an elaborate list of the\r\ntribes, with the number of warriors in each. The summing up of these is\r\n56,500. In the usual way of allowing one to five of a whole population\r\nfor able-bodied men, this would represent the number of the savages as\r\nabout 283,000, which slightly exceeds the number of Indians now in our\r\nnational domain.[1359]\r\n\r\nThe lake and river posts which had been yielded up by the French,\r\non the summons, were occupied by slender and poorly supplied English\r\ngarrisons, unwarned of the impending concentration. The scheme\r\nof Pontiac involved two leading acts in the drama: one was the\r\nbeleaguerment of all the fortified lake and river garrisons; the other\r\nwas an extermination by fire and carnage of all the isolated frontier\r\nsettlements at harvest time, so as to cause general starvation. The\r\nplan was that all these assaults, respectively assigned to bodies of\r\nthe allies, should be made at the same time, fixed by a phase of the\r\nmoon. Scattered through the wilderness were many English traders, in\r\ntheir cabins and with their packh-orses and goods. These were plundered\r\nand massacred.[1360] The assailed posts were slightly reinforced by\r\nthe few surviving settlers and traders who escaped the open field\r\nslaughter. The conspiracy was so far effective as to paralyze with\r\ndismay the occupants of the whole region which it threatened. But\r\npluck and endurance proved equal to the appalling conflict. Nearly all\r\nthe posts, after various alternations of experience, succumbed to the\r\nsavage foe. Such was the fate of Venango, Le Bœuf, Presqu’ Isle, La\r\nBay, St. Joseph, Miamis, Ouachtanon, Sandusky, and Michilimackinac.\r\nDetroit alone held out. The fort at Niagara, being very strong, was\r\nnot attacked. The Shawanees and Delawares were active agents in this\r\nconspiracy. The English used all their efforts and appliances to keep\r\nthe Six Nations neutral. The French near the Mississippi were active\r\nin plying and helping the tribes within their reach. The last French\r\nflag that came down on our territory was at Fort Chartres on the\r\nMississippi.[1361]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICAL ESSAY ON THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION.[1362]\r\n\r\n_By Dr. Ellis and the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nON some few historical subjects we have volumes so felicitously\r\nconstructed as to combine all that is most desirable in original\r\nmaterials with a judicious digest of them. Of such a character is\r\nFrancis Parkman’s _France and England in North America, A Series of\r\nHistorical Narratives_. So abundant, authentic, and intelligently\r\ngathered are his citations from and references to the journals,\r\nletters, official reports, and documents, often in the very words of\r\nthe actors, that, through the writer’s luminous pages, we are, for all\r\nsubstantial purposes, made to read and listen to their own narrations.\r\nIndeed, we are even more favored than that. So comprehensive have\r\nbeen his researches, and so full and many-sided are the materials\r\nwhich he has digested for us, that we have all the benefit of an\r\nattendance on a trial in a court or a debate in the forum, where by\r\ntestimony and cross-examination different witnesses are made to verify\r\nor rectify their separate assertions. The official representatives of\r\nFrance, military and civil, on this continent, like their superiors\r\nand patrons at home, were by no means all of one mind. They had their\r\nconflicting interests to serve. They made their reports to those to\r\nwhom they were responsible or sought to influence, and so colored\r\nthem by their selfishness or rivalry. These communications, gathered\r\nfrom widely scattered repositories, are for the first time brought\r\ntogether and made to confront each other in Mr. Parkman’s pages.\r\nAllowing for a gap covering the first half of the eighteenth century,\r\nwhich is yet to be filled, Mr. Parkman’s series of volumes deals with\r\nthe whole period of the enterprise of France in the new world to its\r\ncession of all territory east of the Mississippi to Great Britain.\r\nHis marvellously faithful and skilful reproduction of the scenic\r\nfeatures of the continent, in its wild state, bears a fit relation\r\nto his elaborate study of its red denizens. His wide and arduous\r\nexploration in the tracks of the first pioneers, and his easy social\r\nrelations with the modern representatives of the aboriginal stock, put\r\nhim back into the scenes and companionship of those whose schemes and\r\nachievements he was to trace historically. After identifying localities\r\nand lines of exploration here, he followed up in foreign archives the\r\nmissives written in these forests, and the official and confidential\r\ncommunications of the military and civic functionaries of France,\r\nrevealing the joint or conflicting schemes and jealousies of intrigue\r\nor selfishness of priests, traders, monopolists, and adventurers. The\r\npanorama that is unrolled and spread before us is full and complete,\r\nlacking nothing of reality in nature or humanity, in color, variety,\r\nor action. The volumes rehearse in a continuous narrative the course\r\nof French enterprise here, the motives, immediate and ultimate, which\r\nwere had in view, the progress in realizing them, the obstacles and\r\nresistance encountered, and the tragic failure.[1363]\r\n\r\nThe references in Parkman show that he depends more upon French than\r\nupon English sources, and indeed he seems to give the chief credit for\r\nhis drawing of the early Indian life and character to the _Relations_\r\nof the French and Italian Jesuits,[1364] during their missionary work\r\nin New France.\r\n\r\nWe must class with these records of the Jesuits, though not\r\nequalling them in value, the volumes of Champlain, Sagard, Creuxius,\r\nBoucher,[1365] and the later Lafitau and Charlevoix. Parkman[1366]\r\ntells us that no other of these early books is so satisfactory as\r\nLafitau’s _Mœurs des Sauvages_ (1724); and Charlevoix gave similar\r\ntestimony regarding his predecessor.[1367] For original material on\r\nthe French side we have nothing to surpass in interest the _Mémoires\r\net documents_, published by Pierre Margry, of which an account has\r\nbeen given elsewhere,[1368] as well as of the efforts of Parkman and\r\nothers in advancing their publication.[1369] There is but little matter\r\nin these volumes relating to the military operations which make the\r\nsubject of this chapter, though jealousy and rivalry of the schemes\r\nof the English, and the necessity of efforts to thwart them in their\r\nattempts to gain influence and to open trade with the Indians, are\r\nconstantly recognized. In the diplomatic and military movements which\r\nopened on this continent the Seven Years’ War, the English, who had\r\nsubstantially secured the alliance of the Iroquois, or the Six Nations,\r\ninsisted that they had obtained by treaties with them the territory\r\nbetween the Alleghanies and the Ohio, which the Six Nations on their\r\npart claimed to have gained by conquest and cession of the tribes that\r\nhad previously occupied it. But when the English vindicated their\r\nentrance on the territory on the basis of these treaties with the Six\r\nNations, the Shawanees and the Delawares, having recuperated their\r\ncourage and vigor, denied this right by conquest. The French could\r\nnot claim a right either by conquest or by cession. Their assumed\r\noccupancy and tenure through mission stations and strongholds were\r\nmaintained simply and wholly on grounds of discovery and exploration.\r\nMargry’s volumes furnish the abundant and all-sufficient evidence of\r\nthe priority of the French in this enterprise. The official documents\r\ninterchanged with the authorities at home are all engaged with advice\r\nand promptings and measures for making good the claim to dominion\r\nfounded on discovery. These volumes also are of the highest value\r\nas presenting to us from the first explorers, every way intelligent\r\nand competent as observers and reporters, the scenes and tenants\r\nof the interior of the continent. Here we have the wilderness, its\r\nprimeval forests, its sea-like lakes, its threading rivers, shrunken\r\nor swollen, its cataracts and its confluent streams, its marshy\r\nexpanses, bluffs, and plains, and its resources, abundant or scant,\r\nfor sustaining life of beasts or men, all touched in feature or full\r\nportrayal by the charming skill of those to whom the sight was novel\r\nand bewildering.[1370] These French explorers will henceforth serve for\r\nall time as primary authorities on the features and resources of the\r\ninterior of this continent just before it became the prize in contest\r\nbetween rival European nationalities. That contest undoubtedly had\r\nmore to do in deciding the fate of the savage tribes from that time\r\nto our own. There are many reasons for believing that if the French\r\nhad been able to hold alone an undisputed dominion in the interior of\r\nthe continent, their relations with the Indian tribes, if not wholly\r\npacific, would have been far more amicable than those which followed\r\nupon the hot rivalry with the English for the possession of their\r\nterritories. The French were the wiser, the more tolerant and friendly\r\nof the two, in their intercourse with and treatment of the savages,\r\nwith whom they found it so easy to affiliate. Under other circumstances\r\nthe Indians might have come to hold the relation of _wards_ to the\r\nFrench in a sense far more applicable than that in which the term has\r\nbeen used by the government of the United States.\r\n\r\nOf the early English material there is no dearth, but it hardly has\r\nthe same stamp of authority. The story of the Moravian and other\r\nmissions on the Protestant and English side has less of such invariable\r\ndevotedness and success than is recorded in the general summaries of\r\nthe Jesuit and Recollet missions, like Shea’s _History of the Catholic\r\nMissions_, 1529-1854 (N. Y., 1855).[1371] The _Indian Nations_ of\r\nHeckewelder,[1372] the service of the United Brethren, and the labors\r\ninstituted by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel,[1373]\r\nare records not without significance; but they yield to the superior\r\nefficacy of the French.[1374] Among the English administrative\r\nofficers, the lead must doubtless be given to Sir William Johnson,\r\nfor his personal influence over the Indian mind, winning their\r\nfull confidence by fair and generous treatment of them, by a free\r\nhospitality, by assimilating with their habits even in his array,\r\nand by mastering their language. His deputy, Col. George Croghan, as\r\ninterpreter and messenger, was kept busily employed in constant tramps\r\nthrough the woods, and in fearless errands to parties of vacillating\r\nor hostile tribes, to hold or win them to the English interest. The\r\nprincipal and the deputy, in this hazardous diplomacy, were specially\r\nqualified for their office by having mastered the gift and qualities of\r\nIndian oratory, by a familiarity with Indian character in its strength\r\nand weakness, and by endeavoring to keep faith with them, and to\r\nimitate the adroit methods of the French rather than the contemptuous\r\nhauteur of most of the English in intercourse with them.[1375]\r\n\r\nThe reader will naturally go to the biographies of Johnson, Washington,\r\nand the other military leaders of their time, to those of a few\r\ncivilians, like Franklin, and to the general histories of the French\r\nand Indian wars and of their separate campaigns, for much light upon\r\nthe Indian in war; and these materials have been sufficiently explored\r\nin another volume of the present History.[1376] These more general\r\naccounts are easily supplemented in the narratives of adventures and\r\nsufferings by a large class of persons who fell captive to the Indians,\r\nand lived to tell their tales.[1377]\r\n\r\nThe earlier travellers, like P. E. Radisson,[1378] Richard\r\nFalconer,[1379] Le Beau,[1380] and Jonathan Carver,[1381] not to name\r\nothers; the later ones, like Prinz Maximilian;[1382] the experiences of\r\nvarious army officers on the frontiers, like Randolph B. Marcy[1383]\r\nand J. B. Fry,[1384]—all such books fill in the picture in some of its\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nThe early life in the Ohio Valley was particularly conducive to\r\nsuch auxiliary helps in this study, and we owe more of this kind of\r\nillustration to Joseph Doddridge[1385] than to any other. He was a\r\nphysician and a missionary of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and in\r\nboth his professions a man highly esteemed. He was born in Maryland\r\nin 1769, and in his fourth year removed with his family to the\r\nwestern border of the line between Pennsylvania and Virginia. With\r\nabundant opportunities in his youth of familiarity with the rudest\r\nexperiences of frontier life near hostile Indians, he was a keen\r\nobserver, a skilful narrator, and a diligent gatherer-up of historical\r\nand traditional lore from the hardy and well-scarred pioneers. He had\r\nreceived a good academic and medical education, and was a keen student\r\nof nature as well as of humanity. His pages give us most vivid pictures\r\nof life under the stern and perilous conditions; not, however, without\r\ntheir fascinations, of forest haunts, of rude and scattered cabins, of\r\ndomestic and social relations, of the resources of the heroic whites,\r\nand of the qualities of Indian warfare in the desperate struggle with\r\nthe invaders.[1386]\r\n\r\nAnother early writer in this field was Dr. S. P. Hildreth of Ohio, who\r\npublished his _Pioneer History_ (Cincinnati, 1848) while some of the\r\npioneers of the Northwest were still living, and the papers of some\r\nof them, like Col. George Morgan, could be put to service.[1387] Dr.\r\nHildreth, in his _Biographical and Historical Memoirs of the early\r\nPioneer Settlers of Ohio_ (Cincinnati, 1852), included a Memoir of\r\nIsaac Williams, who at the age of eighteen began a course of service\r\nand adventure in the Indian country, which was continued till its\r\nclose at the age of eighty-four. When eighteen years of age he was\r\nemployed by the government of Pennsylvania, being already a trained\r\nhunter, as a spy and ranger among the Indians. He served in this\r\ncapacity in Braddock’s campaign, and was a guard for the first convoy\r\nof provisions, on pack-horses, to Fort Duquesne, after its surrender\r\nto General Forbes in 1758. He was one of the first settlers on the\r\nMuskingum, after the peace made there with the Indians, in 1765, by\r\nBouquet. His subsequent life was one of daring and heroic adventure on\r\nthe frontiers.[1388]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPassing to the more general works, the earliest treatment of the North\r\nAmerican Indians, of more than local scope, was the work of James\r\nAdair, first published in 1775, a section of whose map, showing the\r\nposition of the Indian tribes within the present United States at that\r\ntime, is given elsewhere.[1389] This _History of the American Indians_\r\nwas later included by Kingsborough in _Antiquities of Mexico_ (vol.\r\nviii. London, 1848).[1390] At just about the same time (1777), Dr.\r\nRobertson, in his _America_ (book iv.), gave a general survey, which\r\nprobably represents the level of the best European knowledge at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt was not till well into the present century that much effort was made\r\nto summarize the scattered knowledge of explorers like Lewis and Clarke\r\nand of venturesome travellers. In 1819, we find where we might not\r\nexpect it about as good an attempt to make a survey of the subject as\r\nwas then attainable, in Ezekiel Sanford’s _History of the United States\r\nbefore the Revolution_,—a book, however, which was pretty roundly\r\ncondemned for its general inaccuracy by Nathan Hale in the _North\r\nAmerican Review_. The next year the Rev. Jedediah Morse made _A report\r\nto the secretary of war, on Indian affairs, comprising a narrative of\r\na tour in 1820, for ascertaining the actual state of the Indian tribes\r\nin our country_ (New Haven, 1822), which is about the beginning of\r\nsystematized knowledge, though the subject in its scientific aspects\r\nwas too new for well-studied proportions. The _Report_, however,\r\nattracted attention and instigated other students. De Tocqueville, in\r\n1835, took the Indian problem within his range.[1391] Albert Gallatin\r\nprinted, the next year, in the second volume of the _Archæologia\r\nAmericana_ (Cambridge, 1836), his _Synopsis of the Indian Tribes within\r\nthe United States east of the Rocky Mountains_; and though his main\r\npurpose was to explain the linguistic differences, his introduction is\r\nstill a valuable summary of the knowledge then existing.\r\n\r\nThere were at this time two well-directed efforts in progress to catch\r\nthe features and life of the Indians as preserving their aboriginal\r\ntraits. Between 1838 and 1844 Thomas L. McKenney and James Hall\r\npublished at Philadelphia, in three volumes folio, their _History of\r\nthe Indian tribes of North America, with biographical sketches of\r\nthe principal chiefs. With 120 portrs. from the Indian gallery of\r\nthe Department of war, at Washington_;[1392] and in 1841 the public\r\nfirst got the fruits of George Catlin’s wanderings among the Indians\r\nof the Northwest, in his _Letters and notes on the manners, customs\r\nand condition of the North American Indians, written during eight\r\nyears’ travel among the wildest tribes of Indians in North America, in\r\n1832-39_ (N. Y., 1841), in two volumes. The book went through various\r\neditions in this country and in London.[1393] It was but the forerunner\r\nof various other books illustrative of his experience among the tribes;\r\nbut it remains the most important.[1394] The sufficient summary of\r\nall that Catlin did to elucidate the Indian character and life will\r\nbe found in Thomas Donaldson’s _George Catlin’s Indian Gallery in the\r\nU. S. Nat. Museum, with memoirs and statistics_, being part v. of the\r\n_Smithsonian Report_ for 1885.[1395]\r\n\r\nThe great work of Schoolcraft has been elsewhere described in the\r\npresent volume.[1396]\r\n\r\nThe agencies for acquiring and disseminating knowledge respecting the\r\ncondition, past and present, of the red race have been and are much the\r\nsame as those which improve the study of the archæological aspects of\r\ntheir history: such publications as the _Transactions of the American\r\nEthnological Society_ (1845-1848); the _Reports_ of the governmental\r\ngeological surveys, and those upon trans-continental railway routes;\r\nthose upon national boundaries; those of the Smithsonian Institution,\r\nwith its larger _Contribution_s, and of late years the _Reports of the\r\nBureau of Ethnology_; the reports of such institutions as the Peabody\r\nMuseum of Archæology; and those of the Indian agents of the Federal\r\ngovernment, of chief importance among which is Miss Alice C. Fletcher’s\r\n_Indian Education and Civilization_, published by the Bureau of\r\nEducation (Washington, 1888). To these must be added the great mass of\r\ncurrent periodical literature reached through _Poole’s Index_, and the\r\naction and papers of the government, not always easily discoverable,\r\nthrough Poore’s _Descriptive Catalogue_.\r\n\r\nThe maps of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are, in addition\r\nto the reports of traders, missionaries, and adventurers, the means\r\nwhich we have of placing the territories of the many Indian tribes\r\nwhich, since the contact of Europeans, have been found in North\r\nAmerica; but the abiding-places of the tribes have been far from\r\npermanent. Many of these early maps are given in other volumes of the\r\npresent History.[1397] Geographers like Hutchins and military men\r\nlike Bouquet found it incumbent on them to study this question.[1398]\r\nBenjamin Smith Barton surveyed the field in 1797; but the earliest of\r\nspecial map seems to have been that compiled by Albert Gallatin, who\r\nendeavored to place the tribes of the Atlantic slope as they were in\r\n1600, and those beyond the Alleghanies as they were in 1800. The map in\r\nthe _American Gazetteer_ (London, 1762) gives some information,[1399]\r\nand that of Adair in 1775 is reproduced elsewhere.[1400] In 1833,\r\nCatlin endeavored to give a geographical position to all the tribes\r\nin the United States on a map, given in his great work and reproduced\r\nin the _Smithsonian Report_, part v. (1885). In 1840 compiled maps\r\nwere given on a small scale in George Bancroft’s third volume of his\r\n_United States_, and another in Marryat’s _Travels_, vol. ii. The\r\ngovernment has from time to time published maps showing the Indian\r\noccupation of territory, and the present reservations are shown on maps\r\nin Donaldson’s _Public Domain_ and in the _Smithsonian Report_, part v.\r\n(1885).[1401]\r\n\r\nThe migrations and characteristics of the Eskimos have already been\r\ndiscussed,[1402] and the journals of the Arctic explorers will yield\r\nlight upon their later conditions. We find those of the Hudson Bay\r\nregion depicted in all the books relating to the life of the Company’s\r\nfactors.[1403] The Beothuks of Newfoundland, which are thought to\r\nhave become extinct in 1828,[1404] are described in Hatton and\r\nHarvey’s _Newfoundland_; by T. G. B. Lloyd in the _Journal of the\r\nAnthropological Institute_ (London), 1874, p. 21; 1875, p. 222; by A.\r\nS. Gatschet in the _American Philosophical Society’s Transactions_\r\n(Philad., 1885-86, vols. xxii. xxiii.); and in the _Nineteenth\r\nCentury_, Dec., 1888. Leclercq in his _Nouvelle Relation de la\r\nGaspésie_ (Paris, 1691) gives us an account of the natives on the\r\nwestern side of the gulf.[1405]\r\n\r\nThe Micmacs of Nova Scotia are considered in Lescarbot and the later\r\nhistories and in the documentary collections of that colony; and as\r\nthey played a part in the French wars, the range of that military\r\nhistory covers some material concerning them.[1406]\r\n\r\nFor the aborigines of Canada, we easily revert to the older writers,\r\nlike Champlain, Sagard, Creuxius, Boucher, Leclercq, Lafitau; the\r\n_Voyage curieux et nouveau parmi les sauvages_ of Le Beau (Amsterdam,\r\n1738); the _Nouvelle France_ of Charlevoix; the _Histoire de l’Amérique\r\nSeptentrionale_ (Paris, 1753) of Bacqueville de la Potherie;[1407] and\r\nto the later historians, like Fernald (ch. 7, 8), Garneau (2d book),\r\nand Warburton’s _Conquest of Canada_ (ch. 6, 7, 8). The Abenaki, which\r\nlay between the northeastern settlements of the English and the French,\r\nare specially treated by Bacqueville (vol. iv.), in the _Maine Hist.\r\nSoc. Collection_s, vol. vi., and in Maurault’s _Histoire des Abenakis_\r\n(1866).[1408]\r\n\r\nThe rich descriptive literature of the early days of New England gives\r\nus much help in understanding the aboriginal life. We begin with John\r\nSmith, and come down through a long series of writers like Governor\r\nBradford and Edward Winslow for Plymouth; Gorges, Morton, Winthrop,\r\nHigginson, Dudley, Johnson, Wood, Lechford, and Roger Williams for\r\nother parts. These are all characterized in another place.[1409]\r\nThe authorities on the early wars with the Pequots and with Philip,\r\nthe accounts of Daniel Gookin, who knew them so well,[1410] and\r\nchance visits like those of Rawson and Danforth,[1411] furnish the\r\nconcomitants needful to the recital. The story of the labors of\r\nEliot, Mayhew, and others in urging the conversion of the natives\r\nis based upon another large range of material, in which much that\r\nis merely exhortative does not wholly conceal the material for the\r\nhistorian.[1412] Here too the chief actors in this work help us in\r\ntheir records. We have letters of Eliot, and we have the tracts which\r\nhe was instrumental in publishing.[1413] There is also a letter of\r\nIncrease Mather to Leusden on the Indian missions (1688).[1414] Gookin\r\ntells us of the sufferings of the Christian Indians during the war of\r\n1675,[1415] and he gives also reports of the speeches of the Indian\r\nconverts.[1416] The Mayhews of Martha’s Vineyard, Thomas, Matthew, and\r\nExperience, have left us records equally useful.[1417]\r\n\r\nThe principal student of the literature, mainly religious, produced\r\nin the tongue of the natives, has been Dr. James Hammond Trumbull, of\r\nHartford, and he has given us the leading accounts of its creation and\r\ninfluence.[1418] It was this propagandist movement that led Eleazer\r\nWheelock into establishing (1754) an Indian Charity School at Lebanon,\r\nConnecticut, which finally removed to Hanover, in New Hampshire, and\r\nbecame (1769) Dartmouth College.[1419]\r\n\r\nThe New England tribes have produced a considerable local illustrative\r\nliterature. The Kennebecs and Penobscots in Maine are noticed in the\r\nhistories of that State, and in many of the local monographs.[1420] For\r\nNew Hampshire, beside the state histories,[1421] the Pemigewassets are\r\ndescribed in Wm. Little’s _Warren_ (Concord, 1854), and the Pemicooks\r\nin the _N. H. Hist. Collections_, i.; Bouton’s _Concord_, Moore’s\r\n_Concord_, and Potter’s _Manchester_.\r\n\r\nThe Archives of Massachusetts yield a large amount of material\r\nrespecting the relations of the tribes to the government, particularly\r\nat the eastward, while Maine was a part of the colony;[1422] and the\r\nlarge mass of its local histories, as well as those of the State,[1423]\r\nsupply even better than the other New England States material for the\r\nhistorian.[1424]\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Rhode Island are noted by Arnold in his _Rhode Island_\r\n(ch. 3), and some special treatment is given to the Narragansetts\r\nand the Nyantics.[1425] Those of Connecticut have a monographic\r\nrecord in De Forest’s _Indians of Connecticut_, as well as treatment\r\notherwise.[1426]\r\n\r\nPalfrey (_Hist. New England_, i. ch. 1, 2), in his general survey\r\nof the Indians of New England, delineates their character with much\r\nplainness and discrimination, and it is perhaps as true a piece of\r\ncharacterization as any we have.[1427]\r\n\r\nThe Iroquois of New York have probably been the subject of a more\r\nsustained historical treatment than any other tribes. We have the\r\nadvantage, in studying them, of the observations of the Dutch,[1428]\r\nas well as of the French and English. The French priests give us the\r\nearliest accounts, particularly the relations of Jogues and Milet.[1429]\r\n\r\nThe story of the French missions in New York is told elsewhere;[1430]\r\nthose of the Protestant English yield us less.[1431]\r\n\r\nWe have another source in the local histories of New York.[1432]\r\nThe earliest of the general histories of the Iroquois is that of\r\nCadwallader Colden, and the best edition is _The history of the five\r\nIndian nations depending on the province of New-York. Reprinted\r\nexactly from Bradford’s New York edition, 1727; with an introduction\r\nand notes by J. G. Shea_ (New York, 1866).[1433] The London reprints\r\nof 1747, and later, unfortunately added to the title _Five Indian\r\nNations_ [_of Canada_] the words in brackets. This was the very point\r\ndenied by the English, who claimed that the French had no territorial\r\nrights south of the lakes. Otherwise his title conveys two significant\r\nfacts: first, that the English had come to regard the Five Nations as\r\ntheir “dependants”; and second, that these Indians actually were a\r\nbarrier between them and the French. There was something farcical in\r\nthe formula used by Sir Wm. Johnson in a letter to the ministry: “The\r\ncombined tribes have taken arms against his Britannic Majesty.” The\r\nMohawks had been induced to ask that the Duke of York’s arms should be\r\nattached to their castles. This had been assented to, and allowed as a\r\nsecurity against the inroads of the French—a sort of talismanic charm\r\nwhich might be respected by European usage. But those ducal bearings\r\ndid not have their full meaning to the Iroquois as binding their own\r\nallegiance, nor were the Six Nations ever the gainers by being thus\r\nconstructively protected.\r\n\r\nColden was born in Scotland in 1688, and died on Long Island in 1776.\r\nHe was a physician, botanist, scholar, and literary man, able and\r\nwell qualified in each pursuit. The greater part of his long life was\r\nspent in this country. As councillor, lieutenant-governor, and acting\r\ngovernor, he was in the administration of New York from 1720 till near\r\nhis death. He was a most inquisitive and intelligent investigator\r\nand observer of Indian history and character. In dedicating his work\r\nto General Oglethorpe, he claims to have been prompted to it by his\r\ninterest in the welfare of the Five Nations. He is frank and positive\r\nin expressing his judgment that they had been degraded and demoralized\r\nby their intercourse with the whites. He says that he wrote the former\r\npart of his history in New York, in 1727, to thwart the manœuvres of\r\nthe French in their efforts to monopolize the western fur trade. They\r\nhad been allowed to import woollen goods for the Indian traffic through\r\nNew York. Governor Burnet advised that a stop be put to this abuse. The\r\nNew York legislature furthered his advice, and built a fort at Oswego\r\nfor three hundred traders. When the Duke of York was represented here\r\nby Governor Dongan, and “Popish interests” were allowed sway,—there\r\nbeing at the time a mean pretence of amity between England and\r\nFrance,—the interests of the former were sacrificed to those of the\r\nlatter. This, of course, had a bad influence on the Five Nations, as\r\nleading them to regard the French as masters. The whole of the first\r\npart of Colden’s History deals with the Iroquois as merely the centre\r\nof the rivalry between the French and the English with their respective\r\nsavage allies. The English had the advantage at the start, because from\r\nthe earliest period when Champlain made a hostile incursion into the\r\ncountry of the Iroquois, attended by their Huron enemies, the relations\r\nof enmity were decided upon, and afterwards were constantly imbittered\r\nby a series of invasions. The French sought to undo their own influence\r\nof this sort when it became necessary for them to try to win over the\r\nIroquois to their own interest in the fur traffic. The Confederacy\r\nwhich existed among the Five, and afterwards the Six, Nations was\r\nroughly tried when there was so sharp a bidding for alliances between\r\none or another of the tribes by their European tempters. An incidental\r\nand very embarrassing element came in to complicate the relations of\r\nthe parties, English, French, and Indians, on the grounds of the claim\r\nadvanced by the English to hold the region beyond the Alleghanies\r\nby cession from the Iroquois in a council in 1726. The question was\r\nwhether the Iroquois had previous to that time obtained tenable\r\npossession of the Ohio region, by conquest of the former occupants.\r\nIt would appear that after that conquest that region was for a time\r\nwell-nigh deserted. When it was to some extent reoccupied, the\r\nsubsequent hunters and tenants of it denied the sovereignty of the\r\nIroquois and the rights of the English intruders who relied upon the\r\nold treaty of cession.\r\n\r\nThe rival French history while Colden was in vogue was the third\r\nvolume of Bacqueville de la Potherie’s _Hist. de l’Amérique\r\nSeptentrionale_ (Paris, 1753); and another contemporary English\r\nview appeared in Wm. Smith’s _Hist. of the Province of New York_\r\n(1757).[1434] Nothing appeared after this of much moment as a general\r\naccount of the Six Nations till Henry R. Schoolcraft made his _Report_\r\nto the New York authorities in 1845, which was published in a more\r\npopular form in his _Notes on the Iroquois, or Contributions to\r\nAmerican history, antiquities, and general ethnology_ (Albany, 1847), a\r\nbook not valued overmuch.[1435]\r\n\r\nBetter work was done by J. V. H. Clark in what is in effect a good\r\nhistory of the Confederacy, in his _Onondaga_ (Syracuse, 1849).\r\nThe series of biographies by W. L. Stone, of Sir William Johnson,\r\nBrant, and Red Jacket, form a continuous history for a century\r\n(1735-1838).[1436] The most carefully studied work of all has been that\r\nof Lewis H. Morgan in his _League of the Iroquois_ (1851), a book of\r\nwhich Parkman says (_Jesuits_, p. liv) that it commands a place far\r\nin advance of all others, and he adds, “Though often differing widely\r\nfrom Mr. Morgan’s conclusions, I cannot bear too emphatic testimony\r\nto the value of his researches.”[1437] The latest scholarly treatment\r\nof the Iroquois history is by Horatio Hale in the introduction to\r\n_The Iroquois Book of Rites_ (Philad., 1883), which gives the forms\r\nof commemoration on the death of a chief and upon the choice of a\r\nsuccessor.[1438]\r\n\r\nMoving south, the material grows somewhat scant. There is little\r\ndistinctive about the New Jersey tribes.[1439] For the Delawares and\r\nthe Lenni Lenape, the main source is the native bark record, which as\r\nWalam-Olum was given by Squier in his _Historical and Mythological\r\nTraditions of the Algonquins_,[1440] as translated by Rafinesque,[1441]\r\nwhile a new translation is given in D. G. Brinton’s _Lenâpé and their\r\nlegends; with the complete text and symbols of the Walam Olum, a new\r\ntranslation, and an inquiry into its authenticity_ (Philadelphia,\r\n1885), making a volume of his _Library of aboriginal American\r\nliterature_; and the book is in effect a series of ethnological studies\r\non the Indians of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland.[1442]\r\n\r\nIn addition to some of the early tracts[1443] on Maryland[1444] and\r\nVirginia and the general histories, like those of Beverly, and Stith\r\nfor Virginia, and particularly Bozman for Maryland, with Henning’s\r\n_Statutes_, and some of the local histories,[1445] we have little for\r\nthese central coast regions.[1446] In Carolina we must revert to such\r\nearly books as Lawson and Brickell; to Carroll’s _Hist. Collections of\r\nSouth Carolina_, and to occasional periodic papers.[1447]\r\n\r\nFarther south, we get help from the early Spanish and French,—Herrera,\r\nBarcia, the chroniclers of Florida, Davilla Padilla, Laudonnière, the\r\nmemorials of De Soto’s march, the documents in the collections of\r\nTernaux, Buckingham Smith, and B. F. French, all of which have been\r\ncharacterized elsewhere.[1448]\r\n\r\nThe later French documents in Margry and the works of Dumont and Du\r\nPratz give us additional help.[1449] On the English side we find\r\nsomething in Coxe’s _Carolana_, in Timberlake, in Lawson,[1450] in the\r\nWormsloe quartos on Georgia and South Carolina,[1451] and in later\r\nbooks like Filson’s _Kentucke_, John Haywood’s _Nat. and Aborig. Hist.\r\nTennessee_ (down to 1768), Benjamin Hawkins’s _Sketch of the Creek\r\nCountry_ (1799), and Jeffreys’ _French Dominion in America_. Brinton,\r\nin _The National Legend of the Chata-Mus-ko-kee tribes_ (in the _Hist.\r\nMag._, Feb., 1870), printed a translation of “What Chekilli the head\r\nchief of the upper and lower Creeks said in a talk held at Savannah\r\nin 1735,” which he derived from a German version preserved in _Herrn\r\nPhilipp Georg Friederichs von Reck Diarium von seiner Reise nach\r\nGeorgien im Jahr 1735_ (Halle, 1741).[1452] This legend is taken by\r\nAlbert S. Gatschet, in his _Migration Legend of the Creek Indians, with\r\na linguistic, historic, and ethnographic introduction_ (Philad., 1884),\r\nas a centre round which to group the ethnography of the whole gulf\r\nwater-shed of the Southern States, wherein he has carefully analyzed\r\nthe legend and its language, and in this way there is formed what is\r\nperhaps the best survey we have of the southern Indians.\r\n\r\nThis we may supplement by Pickett’s _Alabama_. Col. C. C. Jones, Jr.,\r\nhas given us a sketch (1868) of Tomo-chi-chi, the chief who welcomed\r\nOglethorpe.[1453]\r\n\r\nC. C. Royce has given us glimpses of the relations of the Cherokees and\r\nthe whites in the _Fifth Report, Bureau of Ethnology_. A recent book\r\nis G. E. Foster’s _Se-Quo-Yah, the American Cadmus and modern Moses. A\r\nbiography of the greatest of redmen, around whose life has been woven\r\nthe manners, customs and beliefs of the early Cherokees, with a recital\r\nof their wrongs and progress toward civilization_ (Philadelphia, etc.,\r\n1885.)[1454] Gatschet cites the _Mémoire_ of Milfort, a war chief of\r\nthe Creeks.[1455] The Chippewas are commemorated in a paper in Beach’s\r\n_Indian Miscellany_.[1456] The Seminole war produced a literature[1457]\r\nbearing on the Florida tribes. Bernard Romans’ _Florida_ (1775) gave\r\nthe comments of an early English observer of the natives of the\r\nsoutheastern parts of the United States. Dr. Brinton’s _Floridian\r\nPeninsula_ and the paper of Clay Maccauley on the Seminoles in the\r\n_Fifth Rept. Bureau of Ethnology_ help out the study. The Natchez have\r\nbeen considered as allied with the races of middle America,[1458] and\r\nwe may go back to Garcilasso de la Vega and the later Du Pratz for some\r\nof the speculations about them, to be aided by the accounts we get from\r\nthe French concerning their campaigns against them.[1459]\r\n\r\nThe placing of the tribes in the Ohio Valley is embarrassed by\r\ntheir periodic migrations.[1460] Brinton follows the migrations\r\nof the Shawanees,[1461] and C. C. Royce seeks to identify them in\r\ntheir wanderings.[1462] O. H. Marshall tracks other tribes along the\r\nGreat Lakes.[1463] Hiram W. Beckwith places those in Illinois and\r\nIndiana.[1464] The Wyandots[1465] have been treated, as affording\r\na type for a short study of tribal society, by Major Powell in\r\nthe _Bureau of Ethnology, First Report_.[1466] G. Gale’s _Upper\r\nMississippi_ (Chicago, 1867) gives us a condensed summary of the tribes\r\nof that region, and Miss Fletcher’s _Report_ will help us for all this\r\nterritory. Use can be also made of Caleb Atwater’s _Indians of the\r\nNorthwest, or a Tour to Prairie du Chien_ (Columbus, 1850). Dr. John G.\r\nShea and others have used the _Collections of the Wisconsin Historical\r\nSociety_ to make known their studies of the tribes of that State.[1467]\r\nOne of the most readable studies of the Indians in the neighborhood of\r\nLake Superior is John G. Kohl’s _Kitchi-Gami_ (1860). The authorities\r\non the Black Hawk war throw light on the Sac and Fox tribes.[1468]\r\nPilling’s _Bibliography of the Siouan Languages_ (1887) affords the\r\nreadiest key to the mass of books about the Sioux or Dacotah stocks\r\nfrom the time of Hennepin and the early adventurers in the Missouri\r\nValley. The travellers Carver and Catlin are of importance here. Mrs.\r\nEastman’s _Dacotah, or life and legends of the Sioux_ (1849) is an\r\nexcellent book that has not yet lost its value; and the same can be\r\nsaid of Francis Parkman’s _California and the Oregon Trail_ (N. Y.,\r\n1849), which shows that historian’s earliest experience of the wild\r\ncamp life. Miss Alice C. Fletcher is the latest investigator of their\r\npresent life.[1469] Of the Crows we have some occasional accounts like\r\nMrs. Margaret J. Carrington’s _Absaraka_.[1470] On the Modocs we have\r\nJ. Miller’s _Life among the Modocs_ (London, 1873). J. O. Dorsey has\r\ngiven us a paper on the Omaha sociology in the _Third Rept. Bureau\r\nof Ethnology_ (p. 205); and we may add to this some account in the\r\n_Transactions_ (vol. i.) of the Nebraska State Hist. Society, and a\r\ntract by Miss Fletcher on the _Omaha tribe of Indians in Nebraska_\r\n(Washington, 1885). The Pawnees have been described by J. B. Dunbar in\r\nthe _Mag. Amer. Hist._ (vols. iv., v., viii., ix.) The Ojibways have\r\nhad two native historians,—Geo. Copway’s _Traditional Hist. of the\r\nOjibway Nation_ (London, 1850), and Peter Jones’ _Hist. of the Ojibway\r\nIndians, with special reference to their conversion to Christianity_\r\n(London, 1861). The _Minnesota Hist. Soc. Collections_ (vol. v.)\r\ncontain other historical accounts by Wm. W. Warren and by Edw. D.\r\nNeill,—the latter touching their connection with the fur-traders. Miss\r\nFletcher’s _Report_ (1888) will supplement all these accounts of the\r\naborigines of this region.\r\n\r\nOur best knowledge of the southwestern Indians, the Apaches, Navajos,\r\nUtes, Comanches, and the rest, comes from such government observers\r\nas Emory in his _Military Reconnaissance_; Marcy’s _Exploration of\r\nthe Red River in 1852_; J. H. Simpson in his _Expedition into the\r\nNavajo Country_ (1856); and E. H. Ruffner’s _Reconnoissance in the Ute\r\nCountry_ (1874). The fullest references are given in Bancroft’s _Native\r\nRaces_,[1471] with a map.\r\n\r\nWe may still find in Bancroft’s _Native Races_ (i. ch. 2, 3) the best\r\nsummarized statement with references on the tribes of the upper Pacific\r\ncoast, and follow the development of our knowledge in the narratives\r\nof the early explorers of that coast by water, in the account of Lewis\r\nand Clark and other overland travels, and in such tales of adventures\r\nas the _Journal kept at Nootka Sound by John R. Jewitt_, which has had\r\nvarious forms.[1472]\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the better studied accounts of these northwestern\r\ntribes was that of Horatio Hale in the volume (vi.) on ethnography,\r\nof the Wilkes’ _United States Exploring Expedition_ (Philad., 1846),\r\nand the same philologist’s paper in the _Amer. Ethnological Society’s\r\nTransactions_ (vol. ii.). Recent scientific results are found in _The\r\nNorth-West Coast of America, being Results of Recent Ethnological\r\nResearches, from the Collections of the Royal Museums at Berlin,\r\npublished by the Directors of the Ethnological Department, by Herr E.\r\nKrause, and partly by Dr. Grunwedel, translated from the German, the\r\nHistorical and Descriptive Text by Dr. Reiss_ (New York, 1886), and\r\nin the first volume of the _Contributions to North Amer. Ethnology_\r\n(Powell’s Survey), in papers by George Gibbs on the tribes of\r\nWashington and Oregon, and by W. H. Dall on those of Alaska.[1473]\r\n\r\nFor the tribes of California, Bancroft’s first volume is still the\r\nuseful general account; but the Federal government have published\r\nseveral contributions of scientific importance: that of Stephen Powers\r\nin the _Contributions to No. Amer. Ethnology_ (vol. iii., 1877);[1474]\r\nthe ethnological volume (vii.) of _Wheeler’s Survey_, edited by\r\nPutnam; and papers in the _Smithsonian Reports_, 1863-64, and in Miss\r\nFletcher’s _Report_, 1888.[1475]\r\n\r\nThis survey would not be complete without some indication of the\r\ntopical variety in the consideration of the native peoples, but we have\r\nspace only to mention the kinds of special treatment, shown in accounts\r\nof their government and society, their intellectual character, and of\r\nsome of their customs and amusements.[1476] Their industries, their\r\nlinguistics, and their myths have been considered with wider relations\r\nin the appendixes of the present volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Signatures]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE PREHISTORIC ARCHÆOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nBY HENRY W. HAYNES,\r\n\r\n_Archæological Institute of America._\r\n\r\n\r\nBY the discovery of America a new continent was brought to light,\r\ninhabited by many distinct tribes, differing in language and in\r\ncustoms, but strikingly alike in physical appearance. All that can be\r\nlearned in regard to their condition, and that of their ancestors,\r\nprior to the coming of Columbus, falls within the domain of the\r\nprehistoric archæology of America. This recent science of Prehistoric\r\nArchæology deals mainly with facts, not surmises. In studying the past\r\nof forgotten races, “hid from the world in the low-delved tomb,” her\r\nchief agent is the spade, not the pen. Her leading principles, the\r\nlamps by which her path is guided, are superposition, association,\r\nand style. Does this new science teach us that the tribes found in\r\npossession of the soil were the descendants of its original occupants,\r\nor does she rather furnish reasons for inferring that these had been\r\npreceded by some extinct race or races? The first question, therefore,\r\nthat presents itself to us relates to the antiquity of man upon this\r\ncontinent; and in respect to this the progress of archæological\r\ninvestigation has brought about a marked change of opinion. Modern\r\nspeculation, based upon recent discoveries, inclines to favor the view\r\nthat this continent was inhabited at least as early as in the later\r\nportion of the quaternary or pleistocene period. Whether this primitive\r\npeople was autochthonous or not, is a problem that probably will never\r\nbe solved; but it is now generally held that this earliest population\r\nwas intruded upon by other races, coming either from Asia or from the\r\nPacific Islands, from whom were descended the various tribes which have\r\noccupied the soil down to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe writer believes also that the majority of American archæologists\r\nnow sees no sufficient reason for supposing that any mysterious,\r\nsuperior race has ever lived in any portion of our continent. They find\r\nno archæological evidence proving that at the time of its discovery\r\nany tribe had reached a stage of culture that can properly be called\r\ncivilization. Even if we accept the exaggerated statements of the\r\nSpanish conquerors, the most intelligent and advanced peoples found\r\nhere were only semi-barbarians, in the stage of transition from the\r\nstone to the bronze age, possessing no written language, or what can\r\nproperly be styled an alphabet, and not yet having even learned the use\r\nof beasts of burden.\r\n\r\nBy a large and growing school of archæologists, moreover, it\r\nis maintained that all the various tribes upon this continent,\r\nnotwithstanding their different degrees of advancement, were living\r\nunder substantially similar institutions; and that even the different\r\nforms of house construction practised by them were only stages in the\r\ndevelopment of the same general conceptions. Without attempting to\r\ndogmatize about such difficult problems, the object of this chapter\r\nis to set forth concisely such views as recommend themselves to the\r\nwriter’s judgment. He is profoundly conscious of the limitations of his\r\nknowledge, and fully aware that his opinions will be at variance with\r\nthose of other competent and learned investigators. _Non nostrum tantas\r\ncomponere lites._\r\n\r\nThe controversy in regard to the antiquity of man in the old world\r\nmay be regarded as substantially settled. Scarcely any one now denies\r\nthat man was in existence there during the close of the quaternary\r\nor pleistocene period; but there is a great difference of opinion as\r\nto the sufficiency of the evidence thus far brought forward to prove\r\nthat he had made his appearance in Europe in the previous tertiary\r\nperiod, or even in the earlier part of the quaternary. What is the\r\npresent state of opinion in regard to the correlative question about\r\nthe antiquity of man in America? Less than ten years ago the latest\r\ntreatise published in this country, in which this subject came under\r\ndiscussion, met the question with the sweeping reply that “no truly\r\nscientific proof of man’s great antiquity in America exists.”[1477]\r\nBut we think if the author of that thorough and “truly scientific”\r\nwork were living now his belief would be different. After a careful\r\nconsideration of all the former evidence that had been adduced in\r\nproof of man’s early existence upon this continent, none of which\r\nseemed to him conclusive, he goes on to state that “Dr. C. C. Abbott\r\nhas unquestionably discovered many palæolithic implements in the\r\nglacial drift in the valley of the Delaware River, near Trenton,\r\nNew Jersey.”[1478] Now a single discovery of this character, if it\r\nwere unquestionable, or incapable of any other explanation, would\r\nbe sufficient to prove that man existed upon this continent in\r\nquaternary times. The establishment, therefore, of the antiquity of\r\nman in America, according to this latest authority, seems to rest\r\nmainly upon the fact of the discovery by Dr. Abbott of palæolithic\r\nimplements in the valley of the Delaware. To quote the language of an\r\neminent European man of science, “This gentleman appears to stand in\r\na somewhat similar relation to this great question in America as did\r\nBoucher de Perthes in Europe.”[1479] The opinion of the majority of\r\nAmerican geologists upon this point is clearly indicated in a very\r\nrecent article by Mr. W. J. McGee, of the U. S. Geological Survey:\r\n“But it is in the aqueo-glacial gravels of the Delaware River, at\r\nTrenton, which were laid down contemporaneously with the terminal\r\nmoraine one hundred miles further northward, and which have been so\r\nthoroughly studied by Abbott, that the most conclusive proof of the\r\nexistence of glacial man is found.”[1480] It will accordingly be\r\nnecessary to give in considerable detail an account of the discovery\r\nof palæolithic implements by Dr. Abbott in the Delaware valley, and of\r\nits confirmation by different investigators, as well as of such other\r\ndiscoveries in different parts of our country as tend to substantiate\r\nthe conclusions that have been drawn from them by archæologists.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PALÆOLITHIC IMPLEMENT FROM THE TRENTON GRAVELS.\r\n\r\nSide and edge view, of natural size. From the _Peabody Museum Reports_,\r\nvol. ii. p. 33.]\r\n\r\nBy the term palæolithic implements we are to understand certain rude\r\nstone objects, of varying size, roughly fashioned into shape by a\r\nprocess of chipping away fragments from a larger mass so as to produce\r\ncutting edges, with convex sides, massive, and suited to be held at one\r\nend, and usually pointed at the other. These have never afterwards been\r\nsubjected to any smoothing or polishing process by rubbing them against\r\nanother stone. But it is only when such rude tools have been found\r\nburied in beds of gravel or other deposits, which have been laid down\r\nby great floods towards the close of what is known to geologists as the\r\nquaternary or pleistocene period, that they can be regarded as really\r\npalæolithic.[1481] At that epoch which immediately preceded the present\r\nperiod, certain rivers flowed with a volume of water much greater than\r\nnow, owing to the melting of the thick ice-cap once covering large\r\nportions of the northern hemisphere, which was accompanied by a climate\r\nof great humidity. Vast quantities of gravels were washed down from\r\nthe débris of the great terminal moraine of this ice-sheet, and were\r\naccumulated in beds of great thickness, extending in some instances\r\nas high as two hundred feet up the slopes of the river valleys. In\r\nsuch deposits, side by side with the rude products of human industry\r\nwe have thus described, and deposited by the same natural forces, are\r\nfound the fossil remains of several species of animals, which have\r\nsubsequently either become extinct, like the mammoth and the tichorhine\r\nrhinoceros, or, driven southwards by the encroaching ice, have since\r\nits disappearance migrated to arctic regions, like the musk-sheep and\r\nthe reindeer, or to the higher Alpine slopes, like the marmot. Such a\r\ndiscovery establishes the fact that man must have been living as the\r\ncontemporary of these extinct animals, and this is the only proof of\r\nhis antiquity that is at present universally accepted.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion among geologists in regard to both the\r\nduration and the conditions of the glacial period, but it is now the\r\nsettled opinion that there have been two distinct times of glacial\r\naction, separated by a long interval of warmer climate, as is proved by\r\nthe occurrence of intercalated fossiliferous beds; this was followed\r\nby the final retreat of the glacier.[1482] The great terminal moraine\r\nstretching across the United States from Cape Cod to Dakota, and thence\r\nnorthward to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, marks the limit of the\r\nice invasion in the second glacial epoch. South of this, extending\r\nin its farthest boundary as low as the 38th degree of latitude, is\r\na deposit which thins out as we go west and northwest, and which is\r\ncalled the drift-area. The drift graduates into a peculiar mud deposit,\r\nfor which the name of “loess” has been adopted from the geologists of\r\nEurope, by whom it was given to a thick alluvial stratum of fine sand\r\nand loam, of glacial origin. This attenuated drift represents the first\r\nglacial invasion. From Massachusetts as far as northern New Jersey,\r\nand in some other places, the deposits of the two epochs seem to\r\ncoalesce.[1483]\r\n\r\nThe interval of time that separated the two glacial periods can be best\r\nimagined by considering the great erosions that have taken place in the\r\nvalleys of the Missouri and of the upper Ohio. “Glacial river deposits\r\nof the earlier epoch form the capping of fragmentary terraces that\r\nstand 250 to 300 feet above the present rivers;” while those of the\r\nsecond epoch stretch down through a trough excavated to that depth by\r\nthe river through these earlier deposits and the rock below.[1484]\r\n\r\nAs to the probable time that has elapsed since the close of the\r\nglacial period, the tendency of recent speculation is to restrict the\r\nvast extent that was at first suggested for it to a period of from\r\ntwenty thousand to thirty thousand years. The most conservative view\r\nmaintains that it need not have been more than ten thousand years, or\r\neven less.[1485] This lowest estimate, however, can only be regarded as\r\nfixing a minimum point, and an antiquity vastly greater than this must\r\nbe assigned to man, as of necessity he must have been in existence long\r\nbefore the final events occurred in order to have left his implements\r\nburied in the beds of débris which they occasioned.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1873, Dr. C. C. Abbott, who was already well known as\r\nan investigator of the antiquities of the Indian races, which he\r\nbelieved had passed from “a palæolithic to a neolithic condition”\r\nwhile occupying the Atlantic seaboard, published an article on\r\nthe “Occurrence of implements in the river-drift at Trenton, New\r\nJersey.”[1486] In this he described and figured three rude implements,\r\nwhich he had found buried at a depth as great in one instance as\r\nsixteen feet in the gravels of a bluff overlooking the Delaware\r\nRiver. He argued that these must be of greater antiquity than relics\r\nfound on the surface, from the fact of their occurring _in place_ in\r\nundisturbed deposits; that they could not have reached such a depth\r\nby any natural means; and that they must be of human origin, and not\r\naccidental formations, because as many as three had been discovered\r\nof a like character. His conclusion is that they are “true drift\r\nimplements, fashioned and used by a people far antedating the people\r\nwho subsequently occupied this same territory.”\r\n\r\nAfter two years of further research he returned to the subject,\r\npublishing in the same journal, in June, 1876, an account of the\r\ndiscovery of seven similar objects near the same locality. Of these he\r\nsaid: “My studies of these palæolithic specimens and of their positions\r\nin the gravel-beds and overlying soil have led me to conclude that not\r\nlong after the close of the last glacial epoch man appeared in the\r\nvalley of the Delaware.”[1487]\r\n\r\nMost of these specimens were deposited by Dr. Abbott in the\r\nPeabody Museum of American Archæology and Ethnology at Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts; and the curator of that institution, Professor Frederick\r\nW. Putnam, in September, 1876, visited the locality in company with Dr.\r\nAbbott. Together they succeeded in finding two examples _in place_.\r\nHaving been commissioned to continue his investigations, Dr. Abbott\r\npresented to the trustees, in November of the same year, a detailed\r\nreport _On the Discovery of Supposed Palæolithic Implements from the\r\nGlacial Drift in the Valley of the Delaware River, near Trenton, New\r\nJersey_.[1488] In this, three of the most characteristic specimens were\r\nfigured, which had been submitted to Mr. M. E. Wadsworth of Cambridge,\r\nto determine their lithological character. He pronounced them to be\r\nmade of argillite, and declared that the chipping upon them could not\r\nbe attributed to any natural cause, and that the weathering of their\r\nsurfaces indicated their very great antiquity. The question “how and\r\nwhen these implements came to be in the gravel” is discussed by Dr.\r\nAbbott at some length. He argued that the same forces which spread the\r\nbeds of gravel over the wide area now covered carried them also; and\r\nhe predicted that they will be met with wherever such gravels occur in\r\nother parts of the State. He specially dwells upon the circumstances\r\nthat the implements were found in _undisturbed_ portions of the freshly\r\nexposed surface of the bluff, and not in the mass of talus accumulated\r\nat its base, into which they might have fallen from the surface; and\r\nthat they have been found at great depths, “varying from five to over\r\ntwenty feet below the overlying soil.” He also insisted upon the marked\r\ndifference between their appearance and the materials of which they\r\nare fashioned and the customary relics of the Indians. The conditions\r\nunder which the gravel-beds were accumulated are then studied in\r\nconnection with a report upon them by Professor N. S. Shaler, which\r\nconcludes, from the absence of stratification and of pebbles marked\r\nwith glacial scratches, that they were “formed in the sea near the foot\r\nof the retreating ice-sheet, when the sub-glacial rivers were pouring\r\nout the vast quantities of water and waste that clearly were released\r\nduring the breaking up of the great ice-time.” This view regards the\r\ndeposits as of glacial origin, and as laid down during that period, but\r\nconsiders that they were subsequently modified in their arrangement by\r\nthe action of water. In such gravel-beds there have also been found\r\nrolled fragments of reindeer-horns, and skulls of the walrus, as well\r\nas the relics of man. Dr. Abbott accordingly drew the conclusion that\r\n“man dwelt at the foot of the glacier, or at least wandered over the\r\nopen sea, during the accumulation of this mass of gravel;” that he was\r\ncontemporary of these arctic animals; and that this early race was\r\ndriven southward by the encroaching ice, leaving its rude implements\r\nbehind. Thus it will be seen that Dr. Abbott no longer considers man in\r\nthis country as belonging to post-glacial, but to interglacial times.\r\n\r\nContinuing his investigations, in the following year Dr. Abbott gave\r\na much more elaborate account of his work and its results, in which\r\nhe announced his discovery of some sixty additional specimens.[1489]\r\nTo the objection that had been raised, that these supposed implements\r\nmight have been produced by the action of frost, he replied that a\r\nsingle fractured surface might have originated in that way or from an\r\naccidental blow; but when we find upon the same object from twenty\r\nto forty planes of cleavage, all equally weathered (which shows that\r\nthe fragments were all detached at or about the same time), it is\r\nimpossible not to recognize in this the result of intentional action.\r\nFour such implements are described and figured, of shapes much more\r\nspecialized than those previously published, and resembling very\r\nclosely objects which European archæologists style stone axes of “the\r\nChellean type,” whose artificial origin cannot be doubted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TRENTON GRAVEL BLUFF.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph kindly furnished by Professor F. W. Putnam, showing\r\nthe Delaware and its bluff of gravel, where many of the rude implements\r\nhave been found.]\r\n\r\nAs some geologists were still inclined to insist upon the post-glacial\r\ncharacter of the débris in which the implements were found, Dr. Abbott,\r\nadmitting that the great terminal moraine of the northern ice-sheet\r\ndoes not approach nearer than forty miles to the bluff at Trenton,\r\nnevertheless insists that the character of the deposits there much more\r\nresembles a mass of material accumulated in the sea at the foot of the\r\nglacier than it does beds that have been subjected to the modifying\r\narrangement of water. He finds an explanation of this condition of\r\nthings in a prolongation of the glacier down the valley of the Delaware\r\nas far as Trenton, at a time when the lower portions of the State had\r\nsuffered a considerable depression, and before the retreat of the\r\nice-sheet. But besides the comparatively unmodified material of the\r\nbluff, in which the greater portion of the palæolithic implements has\r\nbeen found, there also occur limited areas of stratified drift, such\r\nas are to be seen in railway cuttings near Trenton, in which similar\r\nimplements are also occasionally found. These, however, present a more\r\nworn appearance than the others. But it will be found that these tracts\r\nof clearly stratified material are so very limited in extent that\r\nthey seem to imply some peculiar local condition of the glacier. This\r\nposition is illustrated by certain remarkable effects once witnessed\r\nafter a very severe rainfall, by which two palæolithic implements were\r\nbrought into immediate contact with ordinary Indian relics such as are\r\ncommon on the surface. This leads to an examination of the question\r\nof the origin of this surface soil, and a discussion of the problem\r\nhow true palæolithic implements sometimes occur in it. This soil is\r\nknown to be a purely sedimentary deposit, consisting almost exclusively\r\nof sand, or of such finely comminuted gravels as would readily be\r\ntransported by rapid currents of water. But imbedded in it and making a\r\npart of it are numerous huge boulders, too heavy to be moved by water.\r\nDr. Abbott accounted for their presence from their having been dropped\r\nby ice-rafts, while the process of deposition of the soil was going on.\r\nThe same sort of agency could not have put in place both the soil and\r\nthe boulders contained in it, and the same force which transported the\r\nlatter may equally well have brought along such implements as occur in\r\nthe beds of clearly stratified origin. The wearing effect upon these of\r\ngravels swept along by post-glacial floods will account for that worn\r\nappearance which sometimes almost disguises their artificial origin.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion Dr. Abbott attempted to determine what was the early\r\nrace which preceded the Indians in the occupation of this continent.\r\nFrom the peculiar nature and qualities of palæolithic implements he\r\nargues that they are adapted to the needs of a people “living in a\r\ncountry of vastly different character, and with a different fauna,”\r\nfrom the densely wooded regions of the Atlantic seaboard, where the\r\nred man found his home. The physical conditions of the glacial times\r\nmuch more nearly resembled those now prevailing in the extreme north.\r\nAccordingly he finds the descendants of the early race in the Eskimos\r\nof North America, driven northwards after contact with the invading\r\nIndian race. In this he is following the opinion of Professor William\r\nBoyd Dawkins, who considers that people to be of the same blood as the\r\npalæolithic cave-dwellers of southern France, and that of Mr. Dall and\r\nDr. Rink, who believed that they once occupied this continent as far\r\nsouth as New Jersey. In confirmation of this view he asserts that the\r\nEskimos “until recently used stone implements of the rudest patterns.”\r\nBut unfortunately for this theory the implements of the Eskimos bear\r\nno greater resemblance to palæolithic implements than do those of any\r\nother people in the later stone age; and subsequent discoveries of\r\nhuman crania in the Trenton gravels have led Dr. Abbott to question its\r\nsoundness.[1490]\r\n\r\nThese discoveries of Dr. Abbott are not liable to the imputation of\r\npossible errors of observation or record, as would be the case if\r\nthey rested upon the testimony of a single person only. As has been\r\nalready stated, in September, 1876, Professor Putnam was present at\r\nthe finding _in place_ of two palæolithic implements, and in all has\r\ntaken five with his own hands from the gravel at various depths.[1491]\r\nMr. Lucien Carr also visited the locality in company with Professor J.\r\nD. Whitney, in September, 1878, and found several _in place_.[1492]\r\nSince then Professors Shaler, Dawkins, Wright, Lewis, and others,\r\nincluding the writer, have all succeeded in finding specimens either\r\nin place or in the talus along the face of the bluff, from which they\r\nhad washed out from freshly exposed surfaces of the gravel.[1493]\r\nThe whole number thus far discovered by Dr. Abbott amounts to\r\nabout four hundred specimens.[1494] Meanwhile, the problem of the\r\nconditions under which the Trenton gravels had been accumulated was\r\nmade the subject of careful study by other competent geologists,\r\nbesides Professor Shaler, to whose opinion reference has already been\r\nmade. In October, 1877, the late Thomas Belt, F. G. S., visited the\r\nlocality, and shortly afterwards published an account of Dr. Abbott’s\r\ndiscoveries, illustrated by several geological sections of the gravel.\r\nHis conclusion is, “that after the land-ice retired, or whilst it was\r\nretiring, and before the coast was submerged to such a depth as to\r\npermit the flotation of icebergs from the north, the upper pebble-beds\r\ncontaining the stone implements were formed.”[1495] The geologists of\r\nthe New Jersey Survey had already recognized the distinction between\r\nthe drift gravels of Trenton and the earlier yellow marine gravels\r\nwhich cover the lower part of the State. But it was the late Professor\r\nHenry Carvill Lewis, of Philadelphia, who first accurately described\r\nthe character and limits of the Trenton gravels.[1496] This he had\r\ncarefully mapped before he was informed of Dr. Abbott’s discoveries,\r\nand it has been found (with only one possible very recent exception)\r\nthat the implements occur solely in these newer gravels of the glacial\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nProfessor Lewis’s matured conclusions in regard to the geological\r\ncharacter and the age of the Trenton gravel cliff are thus expressed:\r\n“The presence of large boulders in the bluff at Trenton, and the extent\r\nand depth of the gravel at this place, have led to the supposition that\r\nthere was here the extremity of a glacial moraine. Yet the absence of\r\n‘till’ and of scratched boulders, the absence of glacial striæ upon the\r\nrocks of the valley, and the stratified character of the gravel, all\r\npoint to water action alone as the agent of deposition. The depth of\r\nthe gravel and the presence of the bluff at this point are explained by\r\nthe peculiar position that Trenton occupies relatively to the river,\r\n... in a position where naturally the largest amount of a river gravel\r\nwould be deposited, and where its best exposures would be exhibited....\r\nAny drift material which the flooded river swept down its channel\r\nwould here, upon meeting tide-water, be in great part deposited.\r\nBoulders which had been rolled down the inclined floor of the upper\r\nvalley would here stop in their course, and all be heaped up with the\r\ncoarser gravel in the more slowly flowing water, except such as cakes\r\nof floating ice could carry oceanward.... Having heaped up a mass of\r\ndetritus in the old river channel as an obstruction at the mouth of the\r\ngorge, the river, so soon as its volume diminished, would immediately\r\nbegin wearing away a new channel for itself down to ocean level. This\r\nwould be readily accomplished through the loose material, and would\r\nbe stopped only when rock was reached.... It has been thought that to\r\naccount for the high bank at Trenton an elevation of the land must have\r\noccurred.... An increase in the volume of the river will explain all\r\nthe facts. The accompanying diagram will render this more clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of bluff two miles south of Trenton, New Jersey.\r\n_a b_, TRENTON GRAVEL; Implements—_a_, fine gray sand (boulder); _b_,\r\ncoarse sandy gravel; _c_, red gravel; _d_, yellow gravel (pre-glacial);\r\n_e_, plastic clay (Wealden); _f_, fine yellow sand (Hastings?); _g_,\r\ngneiss; _h_, alluvial mud; _i_, Delaware River.\r\n\r\nA From a cut in _Primitive Industry_, p. 535.]\r\n\r\n“The Trenton gravel, now confined to the sandy flat borders of the\r\nriver, corresponds to the ‘intervale’ of New England rivers, ... and\r\nexhibits a topography peculiar to a true river gravel. Frequently\r\ninstead of forming a flat plain it forms higher ground close to the\r\npresent river channel than it does near its ancient bank. Moreover,\r\nnot only does the ground thus slope downward on retreating from the\r\nriver, but the boulders become smaller and less abundant. Both of these\r\nfacts are in accordance with the facts of river deposits. In time of\r\nflood the rapidly flowing water in the main channel, bearing detritus,\r\nis checked by the more quiet waters at the side of the river, and is\r\nforced to deposit its gravel and boulders as a kind of bank.... Having\r\nshown that the Trenton gravel is a true river gravel of comparatively\r\nrecent age, it remains to point out the relation it bears to the\r\nglacial epoch.... Two hypotheses only can be applied to the Trenton\r\ngravel. It is either _post_-glacial, or it belongs to the very last\r\nportion of the glacial period. The view held by the late Thomas Belt\r\ncan no longer be maintained.... He fails to recognize any distinction\r\nbetween the gravels. As we have seen, the Trenton gravel is truly\r\npost-glacial. It only remains to define more strictly the meaning of\r\nthat term. There is evidence to support both of these hypotheses.”[1497]\r\n\r\nAfter discussing them both at considerable length, he concludes as\r\nfollows: “A second glacial period in Europe, known as the ‘Reindeer\r\nPeriod,’ has long been recognized. It appears to have followed that\r\nin which the clays were deposited and the terraces formed, and may\r\ntherefore correspond with the period of the Trenton gravel. If there\r\nhave been two glacial epochs in this country, the Trenton gravel cannot\r\nbe earlier than the close of the later one. If there has been but one,\r\ntraces of the glacier must have continued into comparatively recent\r\ntimes, or long after the period of submergence. The Trenton gravel,\r\nwhether made by long-continued floods which followed a first or second\r\nglacial epoch,—whether separated from all true glacial action or the\r\nresult of the glacier’s final melting,—is truly a post-glacial deposit,\r\nbut still a phenomenon of essentially glacial times,—times more nearly\r\nrelated to the Great Ice Age than to the present.”\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to consider the bearings of the age of this gravel\r\nupon the question of the antiquity of man. “When we find that the\r\nTrenton gravel contains implements of human workmanship so placed with\r\nreference to it that it is evident that at or soon after the time of\r\nits deposition man had appeared on its borders, and when the question\r\nof the antiquity of man in America is thus before us, we are tempted\r\nto inquire still further into the age of the deposit under discussion.\r\nIt has been clearly shown by several competent archæologists that the\r\nimplements that have been found are a constituent part of the gravel,\r\nand not intrusive objects. It was of peculiar interest to find that\r\nit has been only within the limits of the Trenton gravel, precisely\r\ntraced out by the writer, that Dr. Abbott, Professor F. W. Putnam, Mr.\r\nLucien Carr, and others, have discovered these implements _in situ_....\r\nAt the localities on the Pennsylvania Railroad, where extensive\r\nexposures of these gravels have been made, the deposit is undoubtedly\r\nundisturbed. No implements could have come into this gravel except at\r\na time when the river flowed upon it, and when they might have sunk\r\nthrough the loose and shifting material. All the evidence points to the\r\nconclusion that at the time of the Trenton gravel flood man ... lived\r\nupon the banks of the ancient Delaware, and lost his stone implements\r\nin the shifting sands and gravel of the bed of that stream.... The\r\nactual age of the Trenton gravel, and the consequent date to which the\r\nantiquity of man on the Delaware should be assigned, is a question\r\nwhich geological data alone are insufficient to solve. The only clew,\r\nand that a most unsatisfactory one, is afforded by calculations based\r\nupon the amount of erosion. This, like all geological considerations,\r\nis relative rather than absolute, yet several calculations have been\r\nmade, which, based either upon the rate of erosion of river channels or\r\nthe rate of accumulation of sediment, have attempted to fix the date\r\nof the close of the glacial epoch. By assuming that the Trenton gravel\r\nwas deposited immediately after the close of this epoch, an account\r\nof such calculations may be of interest. If the Trenton gravel is\r\n_post_-glacial in the widest acceptation of the term, a yet later date\r\nmust be assigned to it.”\r\n\r\nAfter going carefully through them all, he concludes: “Thus we find\r\nthat if any reliance is to be placed upon such calculations, even if we\r\nassume that the Trenton gravel is of glacial age, it is not necessary\r\nto make it more than ten thousand years old. The time necessary for\r\nthe Delaware to cut through the gravel down to the rock is by no\r\nmeans great. When it is noted that the gravel cliff at Trenton was\r\nmade by a side wearing away at a bank, and when it is remembered that\r\nthe erosive power of the Delaware River was formerly greater than at\r\npresent, it will be conceded that the presence of the cliff at Trenton\r\nwill not necessarily infer its high antiquity; nor in the character of\r\nthe gravel is there any evidence that the time of its deposition need\r\nhave been long. It may be that, as investigations are carried further,\r\nit will result not so much in proving man of very great antiquity as\r\nin showing how much more recent than usually supposed was the final\r\ndisappearance of the glacier.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Lewis’s studies of the great terminal moraine of the\r\nnorthern ice-sheet were still further prosecuted in conjunction\r\nwith Professor George Frederick Wright, of Oberlin, Ohio, whose\r\nlabors have been of the highest importance in shedding light upon\r\nthe question of the antiquity of man in America.[1498] Together they\r\ntraced the southern boundary of the glacial region across the State\r\nof Pennsylvania, and subsequently Professor Wright has continued his\r\nresearches through the States of Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, as far\r\nas the Mississippi River and even beyond. He has found that glacial\r\nfloods similar to those of the Delaware valley have deposited similar\r\nbeds of drift gravel in the valleys of all the southerly flowing\r\nrivers, and he has called attention to the importance of searching in\r\nthem for palæolithic implements. As early as March, 1883, he predicted\r\nthat traces of early man would be found in the extensive terraces and\r\ngravel deposits of the southern portion of Ohio.[1499] This prediction\r\nwas speedily fulfilled, and upon November 4, 1885, Professor Putnam\r\nreported to the Boston Society of Natural History that Dr. C. L. Metz,\r\nof Madisonville, Ohio, had found in the gravels of the valley of the\r\nLittle Miami River, at that place, eight feet below the surface, a rude\r\nimplement made of black flint, of about the same size and shape as one\r\nof the same material found by Dr. Abbott in the Trenton gravels. This\r\nwas followed by the announcement from Dr. Metz that he had discovered\r\nanother specimen (a chipped pebble) in the gravels at Loveland, in\r\nthe same valley, at a depth of nearly thirty feet from the surface.\r\nProfessor Wright has visited both localities, and given a detailed\r\ndescription of them, illustrated by a map. He finds that the deposit\r\nat Madisonville clearly belongs to the glacial-terrace epoch, and is\r\nunderlain by “till,” while in that at Loveland it is known that the\r\nbones of the mastodon have been discovered. He closes his account\r\nwith these words: “In the light of the exposition just given, these\r\nimplements will at once be recognized as among the most important\r\narchæological discoveries yet made in America, ranking on a par with\r\nthose of Dr. Abbott at Trenton, New Jersey. They show that in Ohio, as\r\nwell as on the Atlantic coast, man was an inhabitant before the close\r\nof the glacial period.”[1500] Further confirmation of these predictions\r\nwas received at the meeting of the American Association for the\r\nAdvancement of Science, at Cleveland, Ohio, in August, 1888, when Mr.\r\nHilborne T. Cresson reported his discovery of a large flint implement\r\nin the glacial gravels of Jackson County, Indiana, as well as of two\r\nchipped implements made of argillite, which he had found _in place_ at\r\na depth of several feet in the ancient terrace of the Delaware River,\r\nin Claymont, Newcastle County, Delaware.[1501]\r\n\r\nThis discovery of Mr. Cresson’s has assumed a great geological\r\nimportance, and it is thus reported by him: “Toward midday of July 13,\r\n1887, while lying upon the edge of the railroad cut, sketching the\r\nboulder line, my eye chanced to notice a piece of steel-gray substance,\r\nstrongly relieved in the sunlight against the red-colored gravel, just\r\nabove where it joined the lower grayish-red portion. It seemed to me\r\nlike argillite, and being firmly imbedded in the gravel was decidedly\r\ninteresting. Descending the steep bank as rapidly as possible, the\r\nspecimen was secured.... Upon examining my specimen I found that it was\r\nunquestionably a chipped implement. There is no doubt about its being\r\nfirmly imbedded in the gravel, for the delay I made in extricating it\r\nwith my pocket-knife nearly caused me the unpleasant position of being\r\ncovered by several tons of gravel.... Having duly reported my find\r\nto Professor Putnam, I began, at his request, a thorough examination\r\nof the locality, and on May 25, 1888, the year following, discovered\r\nanother implement four feet below the surface, at a place about one\r\neighth of a mile from the first discovery.... The geological formation\r\nin which the implement was found seems to be a reddish gravel mixed\r\nwith schist.”[1502]\r\n\r\nProfessor Wright thus comments upon these discoveries and their\r\ngeological situation: “The discovery of palæolithic implements, as\r\ndescribed by Mr. Cresson, near Claymont, Del., unfolds a new chapter\r\nin the history of man in America. It was my privilege in November last\r\nto visit the spot with him, and to spend a day examining the various\r\nfeatures of the locality.... The cut in the Baltimore and Ohio railroad\r\nin which this implement was found is about one mile and a half west\r\nof the Delaware River, and about one hundred and fifty feet above it.\r\nThe river is here quite broad. Indeed, it has ceased to be a river,\r\nand is already merging into Delaware Bay; the New Jersey shore being\r\nabout three miles distant from the Delaware side. The ascent from\r\nthe bay at Claymont to the locality under consideration is by three\r\nor four well-marked benches. These probably are not terraces in the\r\nstrict sense of the word, but shelves marking different periods of\r\nerosion when the land stood at these several levels, but now thinly\r\ncovered with old river deposits. Upon reaching the locality of Mr.\r\nCresson’s recent discovery, we find a well-marked superficial water\r\ndeposit containing pebbles and small boulders up to two or three\r\nfeet in diameter, and resting unconformably upon other deposits,\r\ndifferent in character, and in some places directly upon the decomposed\r\nschists which characterize the locality. This is without question\r\nthe Philadelphia Red Gravel and Brick Clay of Lewis. The implement\r\nsubmitted to us was found near the bottom of this upper deposit, and\r\neight feet below the surface.... As Mr. Cresson was on the ground\r\nwhen the implement was uncovered, and took it out with his own hands,\r\nthere would seem to be no reasonable doubt that it was originally a\r\npart of the deposit; for Mr. Cresson is no novice in these matters,\r\nbut has had unusual opportunities, both in this country and in the\r\nold world, to study the localities where similar discoveries have\r\nheretofore been made. The absorbing question concerning the age of this\r\ndeposit is therefore forced upon our attention as archæologists....\r\nThe determination of the age of these particular deposits at Claymont\r\ninvolves a discussion of the whole question of the Ice Age in North\r\nAmerica, and especially that of the duality of the glacial epoch. At a\r\nmeeting of this society on January 19, 1881, I discussed the age of the\r\nTrenton gravel, in which Dr. Abbott has found so many palæoliths, and\r\nwas led also incidentally at the same time to discuss the relative age\r\nof what Professor Lewis called the Philadelphia Red Gravel. I had at\r\nthat time recently made repeated trips to Trenton, and with Professor\r\nLewis had been over considerable portions of the Delaware valley for\r\nthe express purpose of determining these questions. The conclusions to\r\nwhich we—that is, Professor Lewis and myself—came were thus expressed\r\nin the paper above referred to (_Proc. Boston Soc. of Nat. Hist._, vol.\r\nxxi. pp. 137-145), namely, that the Philadelphia Brick Clay and Red\r\nGravel (which are essentially one formation) marked the period when\r\nthe ice had its greatest extension, and when there was a considerable\r\ndepression of the land in that vicinity; perhaps, however, less than\r\na hundred feet in the neighborhood of the moraine, though increasing\r\ntowards the northwest. During this period of greatest extension and\r\ndepression, the Philadelphia Red Gravel and Brick Clay were deposited\r\nby the ice-laden floods which annually poured down the valley in the\r\nsummer seasons. As the ice retreated towards the headwaters of the\r\nvalley, the period was marked also by a reëlevation of the land to\r\nabout its present height, when the later deposits of gravel at Trenton\r\ntook place. Dr. Abbott’s discoveries at Trenton prove the presence of\r\nman on the continent at that stage of the glacial epoch. Mr. Cresson’s\r\ndiscoveries prove the presence of man at a far earlier stage. How much\r\nearlier, will depend upon our interpretation of the general facts\r\nbearing on the question of the duality of the glacial epoch.\r\n\r\n“Mr. McGee, of the United States Geological Survey, has recently\r\npublished the results of extensive investigations carried on by him\r\nrespecting the superficial deposits of the Atlantic coast. (See _Amer.\r\nJour. of Science_, vol. xxxv., 1888.) He finds that on all the rivers\r\nsouth of the Delaware there are deposits corresponding in character\r\nto what Professor Lewis had denominated Philadelphia Red Gravel and\r\nBrick Clay.... From the extent to which this deposit is developed\r\nat Washington, in the District of Columbia, Mr. McGee prefers to\r\ndesignate it the Columbia formation. But the period is regarded by him\r\nas identical with that of the Philadelphia Red Gravel and Brick Clay,\r\nwhich Professor Lewis had attributed to the period of maximum glacial\r\ndevelopment on the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n“It is observable that the boulders in this Columbia formation belong,\r\nso far as we know, in every case, to the valleys in which they are now\r\nfound.... It is observable also that it is not necessary in any case to\r\nsuppose that these deposits were the direct result of glacial ice. Mr.\r\nMcGee does not suppose that glaciers extended down these valleys to any\r\ngreat distance. Indeed, so far as we are aware, there is no evidence of\r\neven local glaciers in the Alleghany Mountains south of Harrisburg. But\r\nit is easy to see that an incidental result of the glacial period was a\r\ngreat increase of ice and snow in the headwaters of all these streams,\r\nso as to add greatly to the extent of the deposits in which floating\r\nice is concerned. And this Columbia formation is, as we understand\r\nit, supposed by Mr. McGee to be the result of this incidental effect\r\nof the glacial period in increasing the accumulations of snow and ice\r\nalong the headwaters of all the streams that rise in the Alleghanies.\r\nIn this we are probably agreed. But Mr. McGee differs from the\r\ninterpretation of the facts given by Professor Lewis and myself, in\r\nthat he postulates, largely, however, on the basis of facts outside of\r\nthis region, two distinct glacial epochs, and attributes the Columbia\r\nformation to the first epoch, which he believes to be from three to\r\nten times as remote as the period in which the Trenton gravels were\r\ndeposited. If, therefore, Dr. Abbott’s implements are, as from the\r\nlowest estimate would seem to be the case, from ten thousand to fifteen\r\nthousand years old, the implements discovered by Mr. Cresson in the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio cut at Claymont, which is certainly in Mr. McGee’s\r\nColumbia formation, would be from thirty thousand to one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand years old.\r\n\r\n“But as I review the evidence which has come to my knowledge since\r\nwriting the paper in 1881, I do not yet see the necessity of making\r\nso complete a separation between the glacial epochs as Mr. McGee and\r\nothers feel compelled to do. But, on the other hand, the unity of\r\nthe epoch (with, however, a marked period of amelioration in climate\r\naccompanied by extensive recession of the ice, and followed by a\r\nsubsequent re-advance over a portion of the territory) seems more\r\nand more evident. All the facts which Mr. McGee adduces from the\r\neastern side of the Alleghanies comport, apparently, as readily with\r\nthe idea of one glacial period as with that of two.... Until further\r\nexamination of the district with these suggestions in view, or until a\r\nmore specific statement of facts than we find in Mr. McGee’s papers,\r\nit would therefore seem unnecessary to postulate a distinct glacial\r\nperiod to account for the Columbia formation.... But no matter which\r\nview prevails, whether that of two distinct glacial epochs, or of one\r\nprolonged epoch with a mild period intervening, the Columbia deposits\r\nat Claymont, in which these discoveries of Mr. Cresson have been made,\r\nlong antedate (perhaps by many thousand years) the deposits at Trenton,\r\nN. J., at Loveland and Madison, Ohio, at Little Falls, Minn., ... and\r\nat Medora, Ind.... Those all belong to the later portion of the glacial\r\nperiod, while these at Claymont belong to the earlier portion of that\r\nperiod, if they are not to be classed, according to Mr. McGee, as\r\nbelonging to an entirely distinct epoch.”[1503]\r\n\r\nThe objects discovered by both Dr. Metz and Mr. Cresson have been\r\ndeposited in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge, and their artificial\r\ncharacter cannot be disputed.\r\n\r\nAt nearly the same date at which Dr. Abbott published the account of\r\nhis discoveries, Col. Charles C. Jones, of Augusta, Georgia, recorded\r\nthe finding of “some rudely-chipped, triangular-shaped implements in\r\nNacoochee valley under circumstances which seemingly assign to them\r\nvery remote antiquity. In material, manner of construction, and in\r\ngeneral appearance, so nearly do they resemble some of the rough,\r\nso-called flint hatchets belonging to the drift type, as described by\r\nM. Boucher de Perthes, that they might very readily be mistaken the\r\none for the other.”[1504] They were met with in the course of mining\r\noperations, in which a cutting had been made through the soil and the\r\nunderlying sands, gravels, and boulders down to the bedrock. Resting\r\nupon this, at a depth of some nine feet from the surface, were the\r\nthree implements described. But it is plain that this deposit can\r\nscarcely be regarded as a true glacial drift, since the great terminal\r\nmoraine lies more than four hundred miles away to the north, and the\r\nregion where it occurs does not fall within the drift area. It must\r\nbe of local origin, and few geologists would be willing to admit the\r\nexistence of local glaciers in the Alleghanies so far to the south\r\nduring the glacial period. Consequently these objects do not fall\r\nwithin our definition of true palæolithic implements.\r\n\r\nThe same thing may be said in a less degree of the implements\r\ndiscovered by C. M. Wallace, in 1876, in the gravels and clays of the\r\nvalley of the James River.[1505]\r\n\r\nA different character attaches to certain objects discovered in 1877\r\nby Professor N. H. Winchell, at Little Falls, Minnesota, in the valley\r\nof the Mississippi River.[1506] These consisted mainly of pieces\r\nof chipped white quartz, perfectly sharp, although occurring in a\r\nwater-worn deposit, and they were found to extend over quite a large\r\narea. Their artificial character has been vouched for by Professor\r\nPutnam, and among them were a few rude implements which are well\r\nrepresented in an accompanying plate. A geological section given in the\r\nreport shows that they occur in the terrace some sixty feet above the\r\nbank of the river, and were found to extend about four feet below the\r\nsurface. In the words of Professor Winchell: “The interest that centres\r\nin these chips ... involves the question of the age of man and his\r\nwork in the Mississippi Valley.... The chipping race ... preceded the\r\nspreading of the material of the plain, and must have been pre-glacial,\r\nsince the plain was spread out by that flood stage of the Mississippi\r\nRiver that existed during the prevalence of the ice-period, or resulted\r\nfrom the dissolution of the glacial winter.... The wonderful abundance\r\nof these chips indicates an astonishing amount of work done, as if\r\nthere had been a great manufactory in the neighborhood, or an enormous\r\nlapse of time for its performance.”\r\n\r\nThis discovery of Professor Winchell was followed up by researches\r\nprosecuted in 1879 in the vicinity of Little Falls by Miss F. E.\r\nBabbit, of that place.[1507] She discovered a similar stratum of\r\nchipped quartz in the ancient terrace, of a mile or more in width,\r\nabout forty rods to the east of the river, and elevated some\r\ntwenty-five feet above it. This had been brought to light by the\r\nwearing of a wagon track, leading down a natural drainage channel,\r\nwhich had cut through the quartz stratum down to a level below it. The\r\nresult of her prolonged investigations showed that “the stratum of\r\nquartz chips lay at a level some twelve or fifteen feet lower than the\r\nplane of the terrace top.”[1508] While the quartz chips discovered by\r\nProfessor Winchell were contained in the upper surface of the terrace\r\nplain, these were strictly confined to a lower level, and cannot be\r\nsynchronous with them. They must be older “by at least the lapse of\r\ntime required for the deposition of the twelve or fifteen feet of\r\nmodified drift forming the upper part of the terrace plain above the\r\nquartz-bearing stratum.”\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is abundantly confirmed by Mr. Warren Upham, of\r\nthe U. S. Geological Survey, in his study of “The recession of\r\nthe ice-sheet in Minnesota in its relation to the gravel deposits\r\noverlying the quartz implements found by Miss Babbit at Little Falls,\r\nMinnesota.”[1509] The great ice-sheet of the latest glacial epoch\r\nat its maximum extension pushed out vast lobes of ice, one of which\r\ncrossed western and central Minnesota and extended into Iowa. Different\r\nstages of its retreat are marked by eleven distinct marginal moraines,\r\nand this deposit of modified drift at Little Falls Mr. Upham believes\r\noccurred in the interval between the formation of the eighth and the\r\nninth. “It is,” he says, “upon the till, or direct deposit of the\r\nice, and forms a surface over which the ice never re-advanced.” An\r\nexamination of the terraces and plains of the Mississippi Valley from\r\nSt. Paul to twenty-five miles above Little Falls shows them to be\r\nsimilar in composition and origin to the terraces of modified drift in\r\nthe river valleys of New England. In his judgment, “the rude implements\r\nand fragments of quartz discovered at Little Falls were overspread by\r\nthe glacial flood-plain of the Mississippi River, while most of the\r\nnorthern half of Minnesota was still covered by the ice.... It may\r\nbe that the chief cause leading men to occupy this locality so soon\r\nafter it was uncovered from the ice was their discovery of the quartz\r\nveins in the slate there, ... affording suitable material for making\r\nsharp-edged stone implements of the best quality. Quartz veins are\r\nabsent, or very rare and unsuitable for this, in all the rock outcrops\r\nof the south half of Minnesota, that had become uncovered from the\r\nice, as well as of the whole Mississippi basin southward, and this was\r\nthe first spot accessible whence quartz for implement-making could be\r\nobtained.”\r\n\r\nAccording to this view the upper deposit at Little Falls would appear\r\nto be more recent than those laid down by the immediate wasting of the\r\ngreat terminal moraine at Trenton and in Ohio; but the occupation of\r\nthe spot by man upon the lower terrace may well have been at a much\r\nearlier time.\r\n\r\nMany of the objects discovered by Miss Babbitt have been placed in the\r\nPeabody Museum, and as their artificial character has been questioned,\r\nthe writer wishes to repeat his opinion, formed upon the study of\r\nnumerous specimens that have been submitted to him, but not the same as\r\nthose upon which Professor Putnam based his similar conclusions, that\r\nthey are undoubtedly of human origin.\r\n\r\nImplements of palæolithic form have been discovered in several\r\nother localities, but as none of them have been found _in place_, in\r\nundisturbed gravel-beds, either those which have been derived from\r\nthe terminal moraine of the second extension of the great northern\r\nice-sheet, or those which are included within the drift area, they\r\ncannot be considered as proved to be true palæolithic implements,\r\nalthough it is highly probable that many of them are such.[1510]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider the claim to high antiquity of objects which\r\nhave been discovered in several places in certain deposits, equally\r\nregarded as of glacial origin, which occur in the central and western\r\nportions of the United States. These are the so-called “lacustrine\r\ndeposits,” which are believed to have had their origin from the\r\nformer presence of vast lakes, now either extinct or represented by\r\ncomparatively small bodies of water. The largest of such lakes occupied\r\na great depression which once existed between the Rocky Mountains\r\nand the chain of the Sierra Nevada during the quaternary period. The\r\nexisting lakes represent the lowest part of two basins, into which\r\nthis depression was divided; of these, the western one, represented by\r\ncertain smaller lakes, has received the name of Lake Lahontan. This\r\nnever had any communication with the sea, and its deposits consequently\r\nregister the greater or less amount of rain and snow during the period\r\nof its existence. To the eastern the name of Lake Bonneville has been\r\ngiven, and it is at present represented by the Great Salt Lake in\r\nUtah. This formerly had an outlet through the valley of the Columbia\r\nRiver. These lakes are believed to have been produced by the melting of\r\nlocal glaciers existing during the quaternary times in the above-named\r\nmountains; and similar consequences seem to have followed from the like\r\npresence of ancient glaciers in the Wahsatch and Uintah mountains,\r\nwhere no lake now exists.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient deposits of such an immense fresh-water lake, derived\r\nfrom the melting of glaciers in the last-mentioned mountains, which\r\nonce existed in southern Wyoming, Professor Joseph Leidy first\r\nreported, in 1872, the discovery near Fort Bridger of “mingled\r\nimplements of the rudest construction, together with a few of the\r\nhighest finish.... Some of the specimens are as sharp and fresh in\r\nappearance as if they had been but recently broken from the parent\r\nblock. Others are worn and have their sharpness removed, and are so\r\ndeeply altered in color as to look exceedingly ancient.”[1511] The\r\nplates accompanying the report show that some of these objects are of\r\npalæolithic form, but as no further information is given in regard to\r\nthe conditions under which they were discovered, we cannot pronounce\r\nthem to be really palæolithic.\r\n\r\nIn 1874, Dr. Samuel Aughey made known the existence in Nebraska of\r\n“hundreds of miles of similar lacustrine deposits, almost level or\r\ngently rolling.”[1512] To these the name of “loess” has also been\r\ngiven, as well as to the mud deposits derived from the northern drift.\r\nAughey states that these beds are perfectly homogeneous throughout, and\r\nof almost uniform color, ranging in thickness from five to one hundred\r\nand fifty feet. Generally they lie above a true drift formation derived\r\nfrom glaciers in the Black Hills, and represent “the final retreat of\r\nthe glaciers, and that era of depression of the surface of the State\r\nwhen the greater part of it constituted a great fresh-water lake, into\r\nwhich the Missouri, the Platte, and the Republican rivers poured their\r\nwaters.” The Missouri and its tributaries, flowing for more than one\r\nthousand miles through these deposits, gradually filled up this great\r\nlake with sediment. The rising of the land by degrees converted the\r\nlake-bottom into marshes, through which the rivers began to cut new\r\nchannels, and to form the bluffs which now bound them. “The Missouri,\r\nduring the closing centuries of the lacustrine age, must have been from\r\nfive to thirty miles in breadth, forming a stream which for size and\r\nmajesty rivalled the Amazon.” Many remains of mastodons and elephants\r\nare found in this so-called loess, as well as those of the animals now\r\nliving in that region, together with the fresh-water and land shells\r\npeculiar to it. In it Aughey has also discovered an arrow-point and a\r\nspear-head, of which he gives well-executed figures. Both are excellent\r\nexamples of those well-chipped implements which are regarded as typical\r\nof the Neolithic age or the age of polished stone, and are absolutely\r\ndifferent from the palæolithic implements of which we have hitherto\r\nspoken. They were both found in railroad cuttings on the Iowa side of\r\nthe Missouri River, and within three miles of it. The first lay at a\r\ndepth of fifteen feet below the top of the deposit. Of the second he\r\nsays it was “twenty feet below the top of the loess, and at least six\r\ninches from the edge of the cut, so that it could not have slid into\r\nthat place.... Thirteen inches above the point where it was found, and\r\nwithin three inches of being on a line with it, in undisturbed loess,\r\nthere was a lumbar vertebra of an elephant.”[1513]\r\n\r\nThis intermingling in these deposits of the bones of extinct and\r\nliving animals appears to have been brought about by the shifting of\r\nthe beds of the vast rivers he has described, which have been flowing\r\nfor ages through the slight and easily moved material. It seems to be\r\nanalogous to what has taken place in recent times in the valley of the\r\nMississippi and in its delta. The finding, therefore, of arrow-heads\r\nof recent Indian type, even _in place_ under twenty feet of loess and\r\nbelow a fossil elephant-bone, cannot be considered as affording any\r\nstronger proof of the antiquity of man than the oft-cited instances of\r\nthe discovery of basket-work and pottery underneath similar fossils\r\nat Petite Anse Island in Louisiana, or of pottery and mastodon-bones\r\non the banks of the Ashley River in South Carolina. No such discovery\r\ncan be considered of consequence as bearing upon the question of\r\npalæolithic man.\r\n\r\nThe late Thomas Belt wrote to Professor Putnam, in 1878, that he had\r\ndiscovered “a small human skull in an undisturbed loess in a railway\r\ncutting about two miles from Denver (Colorado). All the plains are\r\ncovered with a drift deposit of granitic and quartzose pebbles overlaid\r\nby a sandy and calcareous loam closely resembling the diluvial clay\r\nand the loess of Europe. It was in the upper part of the drift series\r\nthat I found the skull. Just the tip of it was visible in the cutting\r\nabout three and one half feet below the surface.”[1514] Not long after\r\nthis Mr. Belt died, and we are without further information in regard\r\nto the locality. It would seem, however, that the loess in which the\r\nskull occurred belongs to the latest in the lacustrine series, and\r\nconsequently does not imply any very great antiquity for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OBSIDIAN SPEAR-HEAD.\r\n\r\nFound in the Lahontan sediments,—from a cut in Russell’s _Lake\r\nLahontan_, monograph xi. of Powell’s _U. S. Geological Survey_, p. 247.]\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Mr. W. J. McGee, of the U. S. Geological Survey, obtained\r\nfrom the upper lacustral clays of the basin of the ancient Lake\r\nLahontan, where they are exposed in the walls of Walker River Cañon,\r\na spear-head, made of obsidian, beautifully chipped, and perfectly\r\nresembling those found on the surface throughout the southwest. “It\r\nwas discovered projecting point outwards from a vertical scarp of\r\nlacustral clays twenty-five feet below the top of the section, at a\r\nlocality where there were no signs of recent disturbance.”[1515] This\r\nis said to have been “associated in such a manner with the bones of an\r\nelephant or mastodon as to leave no doubt of their having been buried\r\nat approximately the same time.” But we are also told that these lakes\r\nare of very recent date, and that they have “left the very latest\r\nof all the complete geological records to be observed in the Great\r\nBasin.”[1516] The fossil shells obtained from these deposits all belong\r\nto living species; while the mammalian remains, which have been found\r\nin only very limited numbers, and all, with a single exception, in the\r\nupper beds, “are the same as occur elsewhere in tertiary or quaternary\r\nstrata.” Mr. McGee says: “If the obsidian implement ... was really _in\r\nsitu_ (as all appearances indicated), it must have been dropped in a\r\nshallow and quiet bay of the saline and alkaline Lake Lahontan, and\r\ngradually buried beneath its fine mechanical deposits and chemical\r\nprecipitates.”[1517]\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Russell’s opinion, this single implement, although supported\r\nby no other finds of a similar character, is sufficient to prove\r\nthat “man inhabited this continent during the last great rise of the\r\nformer lake.” But if this last great rise occurred in recent times,\r\nthe presence of the bones of tertiary mammals in the upper beds shows\r\nthat great natural forces must have been in operation at that time\r\nto have washed these out of their original place of deposit. The\r\nprincipal organic remains found, we are told, are those of living\r\nshells, and the intermingling of these with the bones of tertiary\r\nmammals could scarcely have taken place in “shallow and quiet bays.”\r\nTo the writer this discovery seems rather to prove that an Indian\r\nspear-head was in some manner washed down and buried in the clays of\r\nthe Walker River Cañon than that man was the contemporary there of\r\nthe tertiary or quaternary mammalia. This fairly seems to be a case\r\nwhere, in the language of Dr. Brinton, “Archæology may at times correct\r\nGeology.”[1518]\r\n\r\nIt is almost paralleled by the discovery made by Mr. P. A. Scott, in\r\nKansas, of a broken knife or lance-head, measuring in its present\r\ncondition two inches and one eighth in length. Sir Daniel Wilson, who\r\nreports it, says: “The spot where the discovery was made is in the\r\nBlue Range of the Rocky Mountains, in an alluvial bottom, and distant\r\nseveral hundred feet from a small stream called Clear Creek. A shaft\r\nwas sunk, passing through four feet of rich, black soil, and below\r\nthis through upward of ten feet of gravel, reddish clay, and rounded\r\nquartz. Here the flint was found.... The actual object corresponds more\r\nto the small and slighter productions of the modern Indian tool-maker\r\nthan to the rude and massive drift implement.” But this most careful\r\nand conscientious observer goes on to remark, “Under any circumstances\r\nit would be rash to build up comprehensive theories on a solitary case\r\nlike this.”[1519]\r\n\r\nIf the discovery by Mr. McGee of this spear-head be insisted upon\r\nas establishing that man inhabited this continent during the last\r\ngreat rise of the lake, it would be easier to believe that that event\r\noccurred in recent and not in quaternary times, than to admit that the\r\ndistinction between palæolithic and neolithic implements, established\r\nby so many discoveries in this country and in Europe, is thereby\r\nutterly overthrown.\r\n\r\nThe only alternative left is to believe that neolithic man was the\r\ncontemporary of the tertiary mammals. To this conclusion we are asked\r\nto come by Professor Josiah D. Whitney, on account of the discovery\r\nof the remains of man and of his works in the auriferous gravels of\r\nCalifornia. The famous “Calaveras skull” is figured upon another\r\npage of this volume, where the circumstances attending its discovery\r\nare briefly referred to.[1520] It is astonishing to see how frail is\r\nthe foundation upon which such a surprising superstructure has been\r\nraised, as it is found set forth in detail in the section entitled\r\n_Human remains and works of art of the gravel series_, in the third\r\nchapter of Professor Whitney’s memoir on _The auriferous gravels of\r\nthe Sierra Nevada of California_.[1521] All is hearsay testimony, and\r\nentirely uncontrolled by any such careful scrutiny as marks the work\r\nof the British Association in the explorations carried on for fifteen\r\nyears at Kent’s Hole, near Torquay. There can be no question that\r\nhuman bones and human implements have often been discovered in these\r\ngravels, but according to the accounts as given these are mingled in\r\nthem in inextricable confusion. What is the character of these objects\r\nof human workmanship? So far are they from being, as Professor Whitney\r\ndescribes them, “always the same kind of implements, ... namely, the\r\ncoarsest and the least finished which one would suppose could be made\r\nand still be implements.” One account speaks of “a spear or lance\r\nhead of obsidian, five inches long and one and a half broad, quite\r\nregularly formed.” Others mention “spear and arrow heads made of\r\nobsidian;” or “certain discoidal stones from three to four inches in\r\ndiameter, and about an inch and a half thick, concave on both sides,\r\nwith perforated centre.” Still another witness speaks of “a large stone\r\nbead, made perhaps of alabaster, about one and a half inches long and\r\nabout one and one fourth inches in diameter, with a hole through it\r\none fourth of an inch in size.” We are also told of a “stone hatchet\r\nof a triangular shape, with a hole through it for a handle, near the\r\nmiddle. Its size was four inches across the edge, and length about\r\nsix inches.” So also oval stones with continuous “grooves cut around\r\nthem,” and “grooved oval disks,” are more than once mentioned. We think\r\nthese quotations will be sufficient to convince the archæologist that\r\nhere is no question of palæolithic implements, but that we have to do\r\nsimply with the common Indian objects found on the surface all over\r\nour country. Besides the rude cuts in Bancroft,[1522] I know of only\r\none example of these California discoveries which has been figured.\r\nThis is the “beautiful relic” described by Mr. J. W. Foster, of which\r\nhe says: “When we consider its symmetry of form ... and the delicate\r\ndrilling of the hole through a material so liable to fracture, we are\r\nfree to say it affords an exhibition of the lapidary’s skill superior\r\nto anything yet furnished by the Stone age of either continent.”[1523]\r\nMr. Foster doubtfully suggests that this object was “used as a plummet\r\nfor the purpose of determining the perpendicular to the horizon.” It\r\nhas been shown, however, by Mr. W. H. Henshaw, that among the Indians\r\nof Southern California similar objects have long been used by their\r\nmedicine-men as “medicine or sorcery stones.”[1524] Whichever may be\r\nheld to be the true explanation of its use, either is more likely to be\r\na characteristic of the Indian race than of primitive man.\r\n\r\nBut the objects whose presence in the gravels is most repeatedly spoken\r\nof are stone mortars, which Professor Whitney supposes were “used by\r\nthe race inhabiting this region in prehistoric times ... for providing\r\nfood.” One of these is stated to have been “found standing upright,\r\nand the pestle was in it, in its proper place, apparently just as it\r\nhad been left by the owner.” It was taken out of a shaft, according\r\nto the testimony, twelve feet underneath undisturbed strata. This was\r\ncertainly a very marvellous thing to have happened if all the objects\r\nfound in the gravels are supposed to have been brought there by the\r\naction of floods of water. But it is a very simple matter, if the\r\nsupposition of Mr. Southall be correct, who thinks that “these mortars\r\nhave been left in these positions by the ancient inhabitants in their\r\nsearch for _gold_.”[1525] The Spaniards found gold in abundance in\r\nMexico, and the locality from which it came is believed by Mr. Southall\r\nto be indicated by a discovery made in 1849 by some gold-diggers at\r\none of the mountain diggings called Murphy’s, in the region in which\r\nProfessor Whitney’s discoveries have taken place. In examining a\r\nhigh barren district of mountain, they were surprised to come upon\r\nthe abandoned site of an ancient mine. At the bottom of a shaft two\r\nhundred and ten feet deep a human skeleton was found, with an altar for\r\nworship and other evidences of ancient labor by the aborigines.[1526]\r\nMr. Southall believes that these mortars were used “for crushing the\r\ncemented gravel of the auriferous beds.” Some corroboration is afforded\r\nfor this suggestion by the fact that stone mortars of a like character\r\nare found in the ancient gold mines, worked by the early Egyptian\r\nmonarchs, in the Gebel Allakee Mountains near the Red Sea, which were\r\nused in pulverizing the gold-bearing quartz.\r\n\r\nAs to the authenticity of the “Calaveras skull,”\r\n\r\n“Great contest followed and much learned dust.”\r\n\r\nThe probabilities seem in favor of its being a genuine human fossil,\r\nand the question recurs as to its character and the presumable age\r\nof the deposits from which it came. The latest geologist who has\r\nstudied the locality, so far as the writer is aware, says of these\r\ndeposits: “Even before visiting California I had suspected these old\r\nriver gravels might be contemporaneous with the glacial epoch, and\r\nI still think this possible. This area was not glaciated, and these\r\nold gravels, hundreds of feet in thickness, may very well represent\r\nthat great interval of time occupied in other regions by the glacial\r\nperiods.”[1527] In discussing this question from the point of view of\r\nthe character of the fossil animal remains contained in the gravels,\r\nwe must continually bear in mind what Professor E. D. Cope says of\r\nthe _Mesozoic and Cænozoic of North America_: “The faunæ of these\r\nperiods have not yet been discriminated.... Many questions of the exact\r\ncontemporaneity of these different beds are as yet unsettled.”[1528]\r\nProfessor Cope has previously pointed out how marked a difference there\r\nis between the quaternary fauna of North America and that of Europe; we\r\nhave no Hippopotamus or Rhinoceros Tichorinus, and they no Megatherium,\r\nMegalonyx, and other species. Under the varying conditions of animal\r\nexistence thus implied, to assail established ideas upon the sequence\r\nin man’s development, or to maintain that he has had a long career on\r\nthe Pacific slope of our continent before he had made his appearance\r\nin Western Europe, seems to the writer to be an attempt to explain\r\n“_ignotum per ignotius_.”\r\n\r\nWhat is really to be understood by the assumption that man existed\r\nin tertiary times? So profound a palæontologist as Professor William\r\nBoyd Dawkins thinks “it is impossible to believe that man should have\r\nbeen an exception to the law of change. In the Pliocene age we cannot\r\nexpect to find traces of man upon the earth. The living placental\r\nmammals had only then begun to appear, and seeing that the higher\r\nanimals have invariably appeared in the rocks according to their place\r\nin the zoölogical scale, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, placental\r\nmammals, it is hardly reasonable to suppose that the highest of all\r\nshould then have been upon the earth.”[1529] When, therefore, some of\r\nthe geologists of our country support Professor Whitney’s claim that\r\nthese discoveries of human fossils have actually proved man’s existence\r\nin the Pliocene period, by arguments mainly based upon the effects of\r\nerosion and the immense periods of time which these imply, or favor\r\nhis inference from the animal fossils contained in these deposits that\r\nthere has been “a total change in the fauna and flora of the region,”\r\nand that “the fauna of the gravel deposits is almost exclusively made\r\nup of extinct species,” we may well insist, with Dawkins, that the\r\nhuman remains should not be regarded as standing upon a different basis\r\nfrom those of the horse, since both occur under similar conditions.\r\nDr. Leidy reports the finding of remains of four different species of\r\nfossil _Equus_. But among them “we may note the skull of a mustang,\r\nidentical with that of Mexico and California, which could not have been\r\nburied in the gravels of Sierra County before the time of the Spanish\r\nConquest, when the living race of horses was introduced.” Professor\r\nJeffries Wyman says of the Calaveras skull: “Any conclusions based upon\r\na single skull are liable to prove erroneous, unless we have sufficient\r\ngrounds for the belief that such a skull is a representative one of the\r\nrace to which it belongs.... We have no sufficient reason for assuming\r\nin the present instance that the skull is a representative one.... The\r\nskull presents no signs of having belonged to an inferior race. In its\r\nbreadth it agrees with the other crania from California, except those\r\nof the Diggers, but surpasses them in the other particulars in which\r\ncomparisons have been made.”[1530] As, therefore, what appear to be\r\nthe skulls of a California Indian and that of a Mexican mustang have\r\nbeen found to occur in the same deposits, this circumstance, instead\r\nof proving that man was an inhabitant of pliocene America, would seem\r\nto the writer to imply either that these deposits are comparatively\r\nrecent, or that the fossil bones found in them are so commingled that\r\narguments based upon purely palæontological considerations can be\r\nregarded as entitled to very little weight.\r\n\r\nBut although some American palæontologists are inclined to argue that\r\nthese deposits belong to the Pliocene, on account of the character of\r\nthe vertebrate fossils found in them, it must not be forgotten that\r\ngeologists generally prefer to refer them to the Pleistocene. They\r\nbelieve that even the superimposition of lava beds upon the gravels\r\ndoes not establish a very high antiquity for them, and question whether\r\nthe time that has elapsed since the outflow of the lava, as measured\r\nby the amount of erosion that has taken place in the gravels, is to\r\nbe regarded as much greater than can properly be assigned to the\r\nPleistocene period elsewhere. Professor Whitney himself admits the\r\ndifficulty of distinguishing whether “deposits have been accumulated in\r\nthe place where we find them previous to the cessation of the period\r\nof volcanic activity. The gravels which have not been protected by a\r\ncapping of basalt, or only thinly or not at all covered by erupted\r\nmaterials, may in some places have been overlain by recent deposits\r\nin such a way that the line between volcanic and post-volcanic cannot\r\nbe distinctly drawn.... It must not unfrequently have happened that\r\nfossils have been washed out of the less coherent detrital beds\r\nbelonging to the volcanic series, carried far from their original\r\nresting-place, and deposited in such a position that they seem to\r\nbelong to the present epoch.”[1531] In one of the reports of Hayden’s\r\nsurvey can be seen a plate representing “Modern Lake Deposits capped\r\nwith Basalt.”[1532] There is sufficient ground for believing that the\r\nvolcanic activity of the regions of the Sierras has continued down to\r\nvery recent times, geologically speaking, and that there is no such\r\ngreat difference of age between the lava-cappings and the other beds\r\nas Professor Whitney supposes. Hayden thinks “the main portion of the\r\nvolcanic material of the West has been thrown out at a comparatively\r\nmodern date.”[1533] Undoubtedly the amount of erosion that has taken\r\nplace in these river gravels implies a great lapse of time, but so\r\ndo the other facts of physical geography which have been employed\r\nas chronometers by which to measure the time since the close of the\r\nquaternary period. To carry this erosion back to the tertiary times,\r\nand to assign man his place in the world then on that ground, in face\r\nof the arguments to the contrary drawn from archæology, palæontology,\r\nand geology, in view of the essential weakness of the testimony upon\r\nwhich the arguments in its favor are based, would seem to be a most\r\nhazardous assumption. It is only equalled by the statement that “the\r\ndiscoveries made in Europe, which have already obtained general\r\ncredence, carry man close to the verge of the tertiary; if not,\r\nindeed, a little the other side of the line.”[1534] In the writer’s\r\nopinion, this is the belief of only a small number of the most extreme\r\nevolutionists in Europe, while the great body of cautious and critical\r\nobservers think that it has not been proved, and a few are willing to\r\nhold their judgment in suspense.\r\n\r\nProfessor Whitney’s conclusions, however, are supported by Mr. Wallace\r\nin the article quoted at the beginning of this chapter, in his\r\ncharacter as an evolutionist of the most advanced school. He says:\r\n“Believing that the whole bearing of the comparative anatomy of man and\r\nof the anthropoid apes, together with the absence of indications of any\r\nessential change in his structure during the quaternary period, lead to\r\nthe conclusion that he _must_ have existed, as man, in pliocene times,\r\nand that the intermediate forms connecting him with the higher apes\r\nprobably lived during the early pliocene or the miocene period, it is\r\nurged that all such discoveries ... are in themselves probable and such\r\nas we have a right to expect.”[1535] In such a frame of mind it is very\r\neasy for him to wave aside every objection raised by the archæologist\r\nto the character of the evidence brought forward to sustain the alleged\r\ndiscoveries. To the objection that the objects accompanying the human\r\nremains, for which such a great antiquity is claimed, are too similar\r\nto those of comparatively recent times, he has a ready answer: “The\r\nsame may be said of the most ancient bow and spear-heads and those\r\nmade by modern Indians. The use of the articles has in both cases\r\nbeen continuous, and the objects themselves are so necessary and so\r\ncomparatively simple that there is no room for any great modification\r\nof form.” The writer can only state here that no archæologist holds\r\nthis opinion, and will refer for a detailed statement of his reasons\r\nfor the contrary view to an article by him upon _The Bow and Arrow\r\nunknown to Palæolithic Man_.[1536]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to believe that so vast a difference in age can be\r\nattributed to the deposits upon the opposite sides of the chain of the\r\nSierra Nevada, as would follow if we are to hold that the auriferous\r\ngravels belong to the tertiary, while the Lahontan deposits belong to\r\nthe quaternary period. Far more reasonable does it seem to suppose\r\nthat they both fall within the two divisions into which we have seen\r\nthat the pleistocene has been divided. To the writer it appears, from\r\nwhat study he has made of the evidences alleged of man’s existence\r\nin North America in early times, that proof is wanting that he made\r\nhis appearance here earlier than in interglacial times. Dr. Abbott’s\r\ndiscoveries seem to be worthy of all the importance which has been\r\nassigned to them, and the more so from the fact that they are in accord\r\nwith similar discoveries made in the Old World. The evidence adduced\r\nappears to be altogether too fragmentary and strained to warrant the\r\nconclusion that has been drawn that there is no proper correlation\r\nbetween the geological calendars of the two hemispheres.\r\n\r\nBesides the numerous palæolithic implements which the Trenton gravels\r\nhave yielded, there have been found in them three human crania, more\r\nor less complete, and portions of others.[1537] Professor Putnam is\r\ninclined to the opinion that these may be veritable remains of the\r\nmakers of the palæolithic implements. But it is difficult to conceive\r\nhow such fragile objects as human skulls, in this period and at this\r\nlocality, could have survived the destructive forces to which they must\r\nhave been subjected. We must recollect that the bones of man are very\r\nseldom met with in the river gravels of the Old World, and such crania\r\nas are accepted as belonging to these deposits are dolichocephalic, and\r\nnot, like these, brachycephalic.[1538] The circumstances under which\r\nthese three have been found are not reported with sufficient detail\r\nto enable us to account satisfactorily for their presence, nor can we\r\nadmit that the fact that they “are not of the Delaware Indian type”\r\naffords any adequate criterion for our judgment. It is well established\r\nthat “in America we find extreme brachycephaly, as well among the\r\nprehistoric as among the historic peoples from British America to\r\nPatagonia. At the same time, dolichocephaly is found, besides among the\r\nEskimos, throughout the American Indian tribes from north to south; but\r\nit cannot be considered an American craniologic characteristic.”[1539]\r\nThe various forms of skulls, moreover, are found to be so intermingled\r\nthat they have been compared to “what might be looked for in a\r\ncollection made from the potter’s field of London or New York.”[1540]\r\nThe problem is still further complicated by the widespread custom\r\namong the American tribes of altering the natural shape of the skull,\r\nsometimes by flattening it, sometimes by making it as round as\r\npossible.[1541] Taking all these matters into consideration, we are\r\ncompelled to regard craniology by itself as an insufficient guide.\r\n\r\nWe have now passed in review such evidences of man’s early existence in\r\nNorth America as seem to be sufficiently substantiated by satisfactory\r\nproof, and have intentionally left out of consideration many former\r\nexamples, which were accustomed to be cited before the science of\r\nprehistoric archæology had formulated her laws and established her\r\ngeneral conclusions, as well as some more recent ones in which the\r\nevidence seems to be weak.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for the writer to express his own conclusions on the\r\nquestion. But first let him draw attention to the state of public\r\nopinion upon this subject as it is well expressed by an English writer:\r\n“The evidence for the existence of palæolithic man in America has been\r\nmore fiercely contested even than in Europe, and the problem there\r\nis certainly more complicated. In Europe we can test the age of the\r\nremains not merely by their actual character, but also by the presence\r\nor absence of associated domestic animals. In America this test is\r\nabsent, for there were virtually no domestic animals save the dog\r\nknown to the pre-European inhabitants. We are therefore remitted to\r\nless direct evidence, namely, the provenance of the remains from beds\r\nof distinctly Pleistocene age, the fabric of the remains, and their\r\nassociation with animals, we have reason to believe, become extinct at\r\nthe termination of that period.”[1542]\r\n\r\nAs an example of the spirit in which this “fierce contest” is waged in\r\nAmerica, it will be sufficient to quote a few passages from a work by\r\none of her most eminent men of science. He is speaking of “what seems\r\nto be a village site in Europe, of far greater antiquity than the Swiss\r\nlake-villages, and which may be a veritable ‘Palæolithic’ antediluvian\r\ntown. It occurs at Solutré, near Mâcon, in eastern France, and has\r\ngiven rise to much discussion and controversy, as described by Messrs.\r\nDe Ferry and Arcelin.... It destroys utterly the pretension that the\r\nmen of the mammoth age were an inferior race, or ruder than their\r\nsuccessors in the later stone age.... Lastly, many of the flint weapons\r\nof Solutré are of the palæolithic type characteristic of the river\r\ngravels, ... while other implements and weapons are as well worked as\r\nthose of the later stone age. Thus this singular deposit connects these\r\ntwo so-called ages, and fuses them into one.”[1543] The only comment\r\nthe writer will make upon this statement is to say that he has twice\r\nvisited the station at Solutré in company with M. Arcelin; that he has\r\nexamined the collection of the late M. De Ferry at his house; and that\r\nhe has before him the work which is supposed to be quoted from,[1544]\r\nand he accordingly feels warranted in asserting with confidence that\r\nnot one “flint implement of the palæolithic type characteristic of the\r\nriver gravels” was ever found at Solutré. A note appended to Sir J. W.\r\nDawson’s rash statement adds: “Recent discoveries by M. Prunières, in\r\ncaves at Beaumes Chaudes, seem to show that the older cave-men were\r\nin contact with more advanced tribes, as arrow-heads of the so-called\r\nneolithic type are found sticking in their bones, or associated with\r\nthem. This would form another evidence of the little value to be\r\nattached to the distinction of the two ages of stone.” The writer\r\nhas already indicated his conviction that palæolithic man had not\r\nadvanced sufficiently to invent the bow and arrow, and he wishes to\r\nadd here that “arrow-heads of the so-called neolithic type” continued\r\nto be ordinary weapons employed during the Age of Bronze. He is only\r\nsurprised that Dr. Prunières’ discoveries are not quoted to prove that\r\nthere is no distinction between the Age of Stone and the Age of Bronze.\r\n\r\nTested by the canons of prehistoric archæology, superposition,\r\nassociation, and style, in the judgment of the writer the fact of the\r\nexistence of palæolithic man upon this continent, and the distinction\r\nbetween the rude palæolithic implement and the skilfully chipped\r\nobsidian objects which belong to what is called in Europe the Solutré\r\ntype (a development of the later period in the early stone age, which\r\ncannot be overlooked in discussing the question of the antiquity of\r\nman), are truths as firmly established as any taught by modern science.\r\nThe small minority who refuse to admit the last stated proposition are\r\nlaggards in her march, and the few doubters who still question the\r\ngenuineness of the palæolithic implements from the Trenton gravels are\r\nnot entitled by their knowledge of the processes of manufacturing stone\r\nimplements to have much weight attached to their opinions.\r\n\r\nRegarding, then, the existence of palæolithic man as established by\r\nthe finding of four hundred of his relics in the Delaware valley near\r\nTrenton, we have next to inquire whether there is evidence that in\r\nthat region man made any progress towards the neolithic condition.\r\nFor an answer to this question we have only to study the immense\r\ncollection of objects gathered by Dr. Abbott, and now deposited in\r\nthe Peabody Museum at Cambridge. This seems to warrant a conclusion\r\nexactly the opposite to Professor Whitney’s, who states that “so far\r\nas California is concerned ... the implements, tools, and works of\r\nart obtained are throughout in harmony with each other, all being the\r\nsimplest and least artistic of which it is possible to conceive;” and\r\nhis further statement that the “rude tools required but little more\r\nskill than is indicated by the chipped obsidian implements which are\r\nnow, and have been from all time, in use among the aborigines of this\r\ncontinent.”[1545]\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that Professor Whitney’s inferences about the\r\nrelics of man occurring in the gravels of California are not at all\r\njustified by the facts relating to their discovery as reported by him;\r\nand as he offers no proof of his other assertion that “chipped obsidian\r\nimplements have been _for all time_ in use among the aborigines of\r\nthis continent,” we will venture to question its accuracy, even should\r\nhe argue that his loose statement was intended to apply only to the\r\naborigines of California. Consequently we are somewhat at a loss\r\nto understand why Dr. Abbott should feel called upon to refute his\r\nconclusions. He does this, however, successfully in his _Primitive\r\nIndustry_, which is so largely based upon this great collection as\r\nto answer satisfactorily as a catalogue for it. In his own words,\r\n“the careful and systematic examination of the surface geology of New\r\nJersey, of itself, it is believed, shows as abundant and unmistakable\r\nevidence of the transition from a true palæolithic to a neolithic\r\ncondition as is exhibited in the traces of human handiwork found in\r\nthe valley of any European river.”[1546] The arguments upon which\r\nthis conclusion is based are drawn from each of the three canons of\r\nprehistoric archæology. A certain class of objects, superior in form\r\nand finish to the rude palæolithic implement, but decidedly inferior\r\nin every respect to the common types of Indian manufacture, with\r\nwhich collectors of such objects all over our country are perfectly\r\nfamiliar, is found occurring _principally_ in deposits which occupy a\r\nposition intermediate between the drift gravels, from which come the\r\npalæolithic implements, and the cultivable surface-soil, in which the\r\nformer implements of the Indians are constantly brought to light by the\r\nordinary operations of agriculture. In other instances, where these\r\npeculiar objects are found on or near the surface, not only do they not\r\nalways occur there in association with the common Indian relics, but\r\nthe material of which they are made, argillite, is the same as that out\r\nof which all the four hundred palæolithic implements are fabricated,\r\nwith the exception of “two of quartz, one of quartzite, and one made\r\nfrom a black chert pebble.”[1547] This peculiar material occurs _in\r\nplace_ only a few miles north of Trenton, and as the ice-sheet withdrew\r\nit afforded “the first available mineral for effective implements other\r\nthan pebbles, and these were largely covered with water, and not so\r\nreadily obtained as at present; while the dry land of that day, the\r\nColumbia gravel, contained almost exclusively in this region small\r\nquartzite pebbles an inch or two in length.”[1548] The objects thus\r\nreferred to exhibit only a few simple types. There is a rudely chipped\r\nspear-head, about three or four inches in length and from one to two\r\nin breadth, characterized by the same kind of decomposition of the\r\nsurface which is seen upon the palæolithic implements. These occur in\r\nlarge numbers; “as many as a thousand have been found in an area of\r\nfifty acres.... A peculiarity ... is their frequent occurrence ... at\r\na depth that suggests that they were lost when the face of the country\r\nwas different from what it now is.”[1549] An implement is often found\r\nwhich was probably used as a knife, also very rudely chipped, and\r\nshaped somewhat like a spear-head, but never having a sharp point.\r\nThe argillite, of which these are made, “is very hard and susceptible\r\nof being brought to a very sharp edge,” but they are now all much\r\ndecomposed upon the surface, and “are frequently brought to light\r\nthrough land-slides and the uprooting of trees from depths greater than\r\nit is usual to find jasper implements”[1550] of the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe most common object of all, however, and one that occurs in\r\nvery large numbers, is a slender argillite spear-point, about three\r\ninches in length, of nearly uniform size, and having little or no\r\nfinish at the base. These are found at various depths up to five\r\nfeet, principally in the alluvial mud that has accumulated upon the\r\nmeadows skirting the Delaware River, that are liable to be overflowed\r\noccasionally by the tide. From this circumstance, in addition to\r\ntheir shape, Dr. Abbott has conjectured that they were used as\r\nfish-spears.[1551] “This deposit of mud is of a deep blue-black color,\r\nstiff in consistency, and almost wholly free from pebbles. It is\r\ncomposed of decomposed vegetable matter and a large percentage of very\r\nfine sand. It varies in depth from four to twenty feet, and rests on\r\nan old gravel of an origin antedating the river gravels that contain\r\npalæolithic implements. This mud is the geological formation next\r\nsucceeding the palæolithic implement-bearing gravels.... A careful\r\nsurvey of this mud deposit, made at several distant points, leads\r\nto the conclusion that its formation dates from the exposure of the\r\nolder gravel upon which it rests, through the gradual lessening of\r\nthe bulk of the river, until it occupied only its present channel....\r\nThe indications are that the present volume and channel of the river\r\nhave been essentially as they now are for a very long period; and the\r\ncharacter of the deposit is such that its accumulation, if principally\r\nfrom decomposition of vegetable matter, must necessarily be very\r\ngradual. Since its accumulation to a depth sufficient to sustain tree\r\ngrowth, forests have grown, decayed, and been replaced by a growth\r\nof other timber. While so recent in origin that it seems scarcely\r\nto warrant the attention of the geologist, its years of growth are\r\nnevertheless to be numbered by centuries, and the traces of man found\r\nat all depths through it hint of a distant, shadowy past that is\r\ndifficult to realize.\r\n\r\n“The same objection, it may be, will be urged in this instance as in\r\nothers where the comparative antiquity of man is based upon the depth\r\nat which stone implements are found,—that all these traces have been\r\nleft upon the present surface of the ground, and subsequently have\r\ngotten, by unexplained means, to the various depths at which they now\r\noccur. It is, indeed, difficult to realize how some of these argillite\r\nspear-points have finally sunk through a compact peaty mass until they\r\nhave reached the very base of the deposit. For those who urge that this\r\nsinking process explains the occurrence of implements at great depths,\r\nit remains to demonstrate that the people who made these argillite\r\nfish-spears either made only these, or were careful to take no other\r\nevidences of their handicraft with them when they wandered about these\r\nmeadows; for certainly nothing else appears to have shared the fate\r\nof sinking deeply into the mud. In fact, the objection mentioned is\r\nmet in this case, as in that of the palæolithic implements, that if\r\nthese fish-spears are of the same age and origin as the ordinary Indian\r\nrelics of the surface, then all alike should be found at great depths.\r\nThis, we know, is not the case. Furthermore, the character of the\r\ndeposit is not that of a loose mud or quicksand, but more like that of\r\npeat. It has a close texture, is tough and unyielding to a degree, and\r\noffers decided resistance to the sinking of comparatively light objects\r\ndeeply into it. This is, of course, lessened when the deposit is\r\nsubject to tidal overflows, and in the immediate vicinity of springs,\r\nwhich, bubbling through it, have caused a deposit of quicksand. While\r\nhere an object sinks instantly out of sight, it is not here that we\r\nmust judge of the character of the formation as a whole; and over the\r\ngreater portion of its area we find no evidence of objects disappearing\r\nbeneath the surface at a more rapid rate than the accumulation of\r\ndecomposing vegetable matter would explain. Efforts have been made to\r\ndetermine the rate of progress of this growth of mould, but they are\r\nnot wholly satisfactory; nevertheless the indications are sufficient to\r\nwarrant our belief that the rate is so gradual as to invest with great\r\narchæological interest the characteristic traces of man found in these\r\nalluvial deposits.”\r\n\r\nAlthough these argillite spear-points seem _principally_ to occur, as\r\nhas been stated, in the alluvial mud along the banks of the Delaware,\r\nyet they are often found upon the surface, and associated with objects\r\nof Indian origin. This circumstance Dr. Abbott attempts to explain by\r\nthe following considerations: “One marked result of the deforesting of\r\nthe country and its constant cultivation has been to remove in great\r\npart the many inequalities of the surface and to dry up many of the\r\nsmaller brooks. The hillocks have been worn down, the valleys filled\r\nup, and this of course has resulted in bringing to the surface, on the\r\nhigher ground, the argillite implements which were at considerable\r\ndepths, and in burying in the valleys the more recent jasper and quartz\r\nimplements of Indian origin that were left upon the soil when lost or\r\ndiscarded by the red man. In the remnants of forests still remaining,\r\nwhere no such disturbance of the soil has occurred, the relative depths\r\nat which argillite and jasper respectively occur indicate the greater\r\nage of the former.”[1552]\r\n\r\nHe recurs to this subject in another place:[1553] “The telling fact\r\nwith reference to these argillite spear-points is that they are not,\r\nin the same sense as jasper arrow-heads, surface-found implements.\r\nThey occur also, and even more abundantly, beneath the surface-soil.\r\nThe celebrated Swedish naturalist, Peter Kalm, travelled throughout\r\ncentral and southern New Jersey in 1748-50, and in his description of\r\nthe country remarks: ‘We find great woods here, but when the trees in\r\nthem have stood a hundred and fifty or a hundred and eighty years, they\r\nare either rotting within or losing their crown, or their wood becomes\r\nquite soft, or their roots are no longer able to draw in sufficient\r\nnourishment, or they die from some other cause. Therefore, when storms\r\nblow, which sometimes happens here, the trees are broken off either\r\njust above the roots, or in the middle, or at the summit. Several trees\r\nare likewise torn out with their roots by the power of the winds....\r\nIn this manner the old trees die away continually, and are succeeded\r\nby a younger generation. Those which are thrown down lie on the ground\r\nand putrefy, sooner or later, and by that means increase the _black\r\nsoil_, into which the leaves are likewise finally changed, which drop\r\nabundantly in autumn, are blown about by the winds for some time, but\r\nare heaped up and lie on both sides of the trees which are fallen\r\ndown. It requires several years before a tree is entirely reduced to\r\ndust.’[1554] This quotation has a direct bearing on that which follows.\r\nIt is clear that the surface-soil was forming during the occupancy of\r\nthe country by the Indians. The entire area of the State was covered\r\nwith a dense forest, which century after century was increasing the\r\n_black soil_ to which Kalm refers. If, now, an opportunity occurs to\r\nexamine a section of virgin soil and underlying strata, as occasionally\r\nhappens on the bluffs facing the river, the limit in depth of this\r\nblack soil may be approximately determined. An average derived from\r\nseveral such sections leads me to infer that the depth is not much\r\nover one foot, and the proportion of vegetable matter increases as\r\nthe surface is approached. Of this depth of superficial soil probably\r\nnot over one half has been derived from decomposition of vegetable\r\ngrowths. While no positive data are determinable in this matter beyond\r\nthe naked fact that rotting trees increase the bulk of top-soil, one\r\narchæological fact that we do derive is that _flint implements_ known\r\nas Indian relics belong to this superficial or ‘black soil,’ as Kalm\r\nterms it. Abundantly are they found on the surface; more sparingly are\r\nthey found near the surface; more sparingly still the deeper we go;\r\nwhile at the base of this deposit of soil the _argillite_ implements\r\noccur in greatest abundance. Here, then, we have the whole matter in\r\na nut-shell. The two forms were dissociated until by the deforesting\r\nof the country and subsequent cultivation of the soil, except in a few\r\ninstances, they became commingled.”\r\n\r\nA further argument in respect to the relation which argillite\r\nimplements bear to those made of jasper and quartz is derived from\r\nthe relative proportion in which they occur in localities which are\r\nbelieved to have been occupied first by the users of argillite, and\r\nsubsequently by the Indians. “Of a series of twenty thousand objects\r\ngathered in Mercer County, New Jersey, forty-four hundred were of\r\nargillite, and of such rude forms and in such limited varieties as\r\nwould be expected of the productions of a less cultured people than\r\nthe Indian of the stone age. Of this series of forty-four hundred, two\r\nhundred and thirty-three are well-designed drills or perforators and\r\nscrapers; the others being spear-points, fishing-spears, arrow-heads,\r\nand knife-like implements.”[1555] This is supplemented by negative\r\nevidence drawn from “the character of the sites of arrow-makers’\r\nopen-air workshops, or those spots whereon the professional chipper\r\nof flint pursued his calling. In the locality where I have pursued my\r\nstudies several such sites have been discovered and carefully examined.\r\nIn no one of these workshop sites has there been found any trace of\r\nargillite mingled with the flint-chips that form the characteristic\r\nfeature of such spots. On the other hand, no similar sites have been\r\ndiscovered, to my knowledge, where argillite was used exclusively.\r\nThe absence of this mineral cannot be explained on the ground that it\r\nwas difficult to procure, for such is not the case. It constitutes,\r\nin fact, a considerable percentage of the pebbles and boulders of the\r\ndrift from which the Indians gathered their jasper and quartz pebbles\r\nfor working into implements and weapons. If the absence of argillite\r\nfrom such heaps of selected stones is explained by the assertion that\r\nthe Indians had recognized the superiority of jasper, then the belief\r\nthat argillite was used prior to jasper receives tacit assent. If,\r\nhowever, it was the earlier _Indians_ who used argillite, and gradually\r\ndiscarded it for the various forms of flint, then we ought to find\r\nworkshop sites older than the time of _flint_-chipping, and others\r\nwhere the two minerals are associated. This, as has been stated, has\r\nnot been done.”[1556]\r\n\r\nProfessor Putnam has found a confirmation of these views of Dr. Abbott\r\nin the contents of a great shell-heap at Keyport, in New Jersey,\r\ninvestigated over thirty years ago by Rev. Samuel Lockwood, and now\r\nplaced in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge. “As the shell-heap at\r\nKeyport, once covering a mile or more in length along a narrow strip\r\nbordered upon one side by the ocean and on the other by Raritan Bay, is\r\nentirely obliterated, it is of importance that the materials obtained\r\nfrom it are now in the museum for comparison with our very extensive\r\ncollections from the shell-heaps of New England. The fact that at\r\ncertain places on this narrow strip between the bay and the sea the\r\nprevailing implements were of argillite and of great antiquity has a\r\npeculiar significance in connection with those from Trenton, and again\r\npoints to an intermediate period between the palæolithic and the late\r\nIndian occupation of New Jersey.”[1557]\r\n\r\nTo these various arguments the writer wishes to add the statement\r\nthat to his personal knowledge argillite spear-points, and especially\r\nthose of the fish-spear type, are occasionally found in other parts\r\nof our country besides New Jersey. In his own researches, which have\r\nbeen principally carried on upon the seacoast of New England, he has\r\n_never_ found an example of them in the shell-heaps proper, which are\r\nuniversally recognized by archæologists as relics of the Indians. The\r\nfew which he has found himself, or has obtained from others, have come\r\nfrom meadows by the side of rivers or ponds, where they might very well\r\nhave been used as fish-spears.\r\n\r\nA further confirmation of Dr. Abbott’s opinions in regard to the\r\ndescendants of palæolithic man is derived from certain discoveries\r\nmade by Mr. Hilborne T. Cresson in the alluvial deposits at Naaman’s\r\nCreek, in Delaware. These were first made known in November, 1887,\r\nby a letter to the editor of the American Antiquarian. “In 1870, a\r\nfisherman living in the village of Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, gave me\r\nsome spear and arrow heads flaked from a dense argillite, as well as\r\nother rude implements of a prehistoric people, which he had found on\r\nsome extensive mud flats near the mouth of Naaman’s Creek, a small\r\ntributary of the Delaware. The finder stated that while fishing ... he\r\nhad noticed here and there the ends of logs or stakes protruding from\r\nthe mud, and that they seemed to him to have been placed in rows....\r\nA visit made a few days afterward to the place ... disclosed the ends\r\nof much-decayed stakes or piles protruding here and there above the\r\nmud.... On my return from France in 1880 I again visited the spot....\r\nWhile abroad I studied in spare moments many archæological collections,\r\nespecially those from the Swiss Lake Dwellings, and visited the\r\nvarious lake stations of Switzerland. The rude dressings of the ends\r\nof the piles in some places were evidently made with blunt stone\r\nimplements, and recalled those I had seen on the ends of the posts in\r\nthe Delaware River marshes. Since 1880 I have quietly examined the\r\nremains, excavating what pile ends remained _in situ_ (preserving a\r\nfew that did not crumble to pieces), preserving careful notes of the\r\ndredging and excavations (at low tides), carried on principally by\r\nmyself, aided at times by interested friends. The results so far seem\r\nto indicate that the ends of the piles imbedded in the mud, judging\r\nfrom the implements and other débris scattered around them, once\r\nsupported shelters of early man that were erected a few feet above the\r\nwater,—the upper portion of the piles having disappeared in the long\r\nlapse of time that must have ensued since they were placed there. (The\r\nflats are covered by four and one half feet of water on the flood tide;\r\non the ebb the marsh is dry, and covered with slimy ooze several feet\r\nin depth, varying in different places.) Three different dwellings have\r\nbeen located, all that exist in the flats referred to, after a careful\r\nexamination within the last four years of nearly every inch of ground\r\ncarefully laid off and examined in sections. The implements found in\r\ntwo of ‘the supposed river dwelling sites’ are very rude in type, and\r\ngenerally made of dense argillite, not unlike the palæoliths found by\r\nmy friend Dr. C. C. Abbott in the Trenton gravels. The character of\r\nthe implements from the other or third supposed river dwelling on the\r\nDelaware marshes is better finished objects made of argillite.”[1558]\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the objects obtained by Mr. Cresson has been\r\nplaced in the Peabody Museum, to which he is at present attached as a\r\nspecial assistant; but he has also kindly sent to the writer a small\r\nillustrative collection from each site, for his study.\r\n\r\nThe writer would hesitate to draw the inference from this single\r\ndiscovery that the custom of living in pile-dwellings ever prevailed\r\nin North America, although there is evidence that such a practice was\r\nnot unknown in South America. This is to be found in the account of the\r\nvoyage of Alonso de Ojeda along the north coast of that country, in the\r\nyear 1499, in which he was accompanied by Vespucius.[1559] I will quote\r\nthe language of Washington Irving: “Proceeding along the coast, he\r\narrived at a vast, deep gulf resembling a tranquil lake, entering which\r\nhe beheld on the eastern side a village whose construction struck him\r\nwith surprise. It consisted of twenty large houses, shaped like bells,\r\nand built on piles driven into the bottom of the lake, which in this\r\npart was limpid and of but little depth. Each house was provided with\r\na drawbridge, and with canoes by which the communication was carried\r\non. From these resemblances to the Italian city, Ojeda gave to the bay\r\nthe name of the Gulf of Venice, and it is called at the present day\r\nVenezuela, or Little Venice.”[1560] There is no inherent improbability\r\nthat such a custom may have prevailed upon the shores of Delaware Bay,\r\nand for the same reason that has caused it to be followed elsewhere.\r\n“It has been stated that the natives living near Lake Maracaybo, in\r\nSouth America, erect pile dwellings over the lake, to which they resort\r\nin order to escape from the mosquitoes which infest the shore. Lord\r\nalso mentions that the Indians of the Suman prairie, British Columbia,\r\non the subsidence of the annual floods in May and June, build pile\r\ndwellings over a lake there, to which they retire to escape from the\r\nmosquitoes which at that period infest the prairie in dense clouds, but\r\nwill not cross the water.”[1561]\r\n\r\nBut it would be safer, probably, to consider these discoveries of Mr.\r\nCresson’s as marking the site of ancient aboriginal fish-weirs, such as\r\nare described by Captain Ribault and other early explorers as made by\r\nthe natives.[1562] The writer agrees with Professor Putnam in thinking\r\nthat “the fact that at only one station pottery occurs, and, also, that\r\nat this station the stone implements are largely of jasper and quartz,\r\nwith few of argillite, while at the two other stations many rude stone\r\nimplements are associated with chipped points of argillite, with few of\r\njasper and other flint-like material, is of great interest.”[1563]\r\n\r\nStill further confirmation of the progress of the palæolithic man in\r\nthis region is afforded by discoveries made in a rock-shelter near\r\nthe headwaters of Naaman’s Creek, as early as 1866, for an account\r\nof which, and the preservation of the objects then found, we are\r\nalso indebted to Mr. Cresson: “The remains of the Naaman’s Creek\r\nrock-shelter luckily fell into hands that have preserved them.... To\r\ngive a detailed account of _how_ the rock-shelter was discovered would\r\nconsume too much time. Let us rather consider briefly the ... contents\r\nof the shelter’s various layers.... Fortunately careful drawings of\r\nthe shelter were made during its excavation between the years 1866 and\r\n1867.... A glance shows the outcrop of the rock as it appeared before\r\nthe excavations were begun in 1866. The trees show that the ground\r\nwas then covered by a thick wood.... From the point that marks the\r\ninnermost edge of the outcrop, overhanging the hollow, a perpendicular\r\nline dropped to the ground would measure five and one eighth feet,\r\nthe height of the projection of the rock above the ground before the\r\nexcavations were commenced.\r\n\r\n“Twenty-two feet eight inches from the outcrop, measured from its\r\ninner face, there is still another outcrop.... This marks the opposite\r\nside of the hollow.... It is evident how admirably the place was\r\nadapted to the wants of the early hunters of the Delaware valley,\r\nwhether it be as a shelter, or as a place of defence against their\r\nenemies.... Let us look at the layers of earth that filled it, these\r\nbeing intermingled with rude implements, broken bones, and charcoal,\r\nindicating that man at times had resorted to the spot.\r\n\r\n“Layer C [the lowest]. This was composed of schist, resting on the\r\nbedrock of the shelter. A layer of aqueous gravel, of the same type\r\nas that underlying Philadelphia, rested on the decomposed schist. The\r\ngreatest depth of the red gravel layer was four feet two and one fourth\r\ninches, measured from the layer of decomposed schist. Least depth of\r\ngravel observed, one foot three inches....\r\n\r\n“Layer A [next above]. This was a layer of grayish-white brick clay\r\nmixed with yellow clay, similar to that underlying Philadelphia, on\r\ntop of which was a layer mixed with sand.... Stone implements were\r\ndiscovered in this layer. They were but few in number and very rude,\r\nexclusively of argillite, and palæolithic in type. Greatest depth of\r\nlayer, two feet one and one half inches. No implements of bone were\r\nfound....\r\n\r\n“Layer T [next above]. This was of reddish gravel, intermingled with\r\ndecomposed schist, cinders, and broken bones of animals. Fragments of a\r\nhuman skull were found ... in this layer. A fragment of a human rib was\r\nalso preserved. The fragments of the skull are covered here and there\r\nby dendritic incrustations. Rude spears and implements of argillite\r\nwere found in this layer. Depth of layer, thirteen to eighteen inches.\r\n\r\n“Layer D [next above]. Composed of reddish-yellow clay. Depth, two feet\r\nthree inches. No implements.\r\n\r\n“Layer M [next above]. In this layer were numerous implements of\r\nargillite and some of bone, intermingled with rude implements of\r\nquartzite and jasper and fragments of rude pottery, with charcoal.\r\nGreatest depth, one foot one and one half inches. Least depth, three\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n“Layer R [next above]. Yellow clay. Greatest depth, two feet one and\r\none half inches; least depth, eight inches. No implements.\r\n\r\n“Layer W [next above]. This contained chipped implements; those made\r\nof jasper and quartzite predominating over those of argillite. In the\r\nlowest part of this layer were fragments of rude pottery. In the upper\r\nportion of the layer were potsherds decidedly superior in decoration\r\nand technique to those from the lower portion. Geological composition\r\nof this layer, yellow clay loam. Greatest depth, three feet four\r\ninches. Least depth, two and one half inches.\r\n\r\n“Layer L [top]. This consists of leaf mould seven inches thick,\r\nconverted into swamp muck by decomposing action of water from springs.\r\nNo implements.... No remains of extinct animals were found.”[1564]\r\n\r\nProfessor Putnam thus proceeded to comment upon these discoveries: “We\r\nhave a series of objects, taken from the several layers of the shelter,\r\ngiving us a chronology of the utmost importance, as each period of\r\noccupation of the shelter was followed by a natural deposition,\r\nseparating the different periods of occupation. The stone implements\r\n... are taken from the lowest layer, indicating the earliest period of\r\noccupation of the rock-shelter; and ... they correspond in shape and\r\nrudeness of execution with those taken from the gravel-bed at Trenton;\r\nand like most of the latter they are all of argillite. The specimens\r\nfrom the second period are of argillite, and while many are chipped\r\ninto slender points, they are still of very rude forms; and these in\r\nturn correspond with the argillite points found by Dr. Abbott deep\r\ndown in the black soil, or resting upon the gravel, at Trenton. In\r\nthe upper layers of the cave we observe ... the gradual introduction\r\nof implements chipped from jasper and quartz, and corresponding in\r\nform with those found upon the surface throughout the valley. And as a\r\nfurther indication of this later development, it was only in the upper\r\nlayers that pottery, bone implements, and ornaments were found; the\r\nthree distinct periods of occupation of the Delaware valley are thus\r\ndistinctly shown; and this cave-shelter is a perfect exemplification of\r\nthe results which Dr. Abbott had obtained from a study of the specimens\r\nwhich he has collected upon the surface, deep in the black soil, and in\r\nthe gravel, at Trenton.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the accumulative force of these various lines of reasoning, the\r\nwriter thinks that there is a strong probability that here, on the\r\nwaters of the Delaware, man developed from the palæolithic to the\r\nneolithic stage of culture. But we cannot follow Dr. Abbott in his\r\nfurther conclusion (if, indeed, he still holds to it) that we are to\r\nseek the descendants of this primitive population in the Eskimos,\r\ndriven north after contact with the Indians. We have failed to discover\r\nthe slightest evidence to sustain this position. The hereditary enmity\r\nexisting between the Eskimos and the Indians may be equally well\r\nexplained upon the theory that the former are later comers to this\r\ncontinent, and are therefore hated by the Indian races as intruders.\r\nThe two races are certainly markedly unlike.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any evidence tending to show the development of the\r\nargillite-using people into the Indian races, with their perfected\r\nimplements and weapons of the age of polished stone, it seems more\r\nreasonable to hold with Professor Dawkins that the earlier and ruder\r\nrace perished before or were absorbed by a people furnished with a\r\nbetter equipment in the struggle for the “survival of the fittest.” The\r\npalæolithic man of the river gravels of Trenton and his argillite-using\r\nposterity the writer believes to be completely extinct.[1565]\r\n\r\nIt only remains for the writer to express his regret that he has\r\nbeen prevented from setting forth in detail, at the present time, the\r\ngrounds upon which he has come to other conclusions which were briefly\r\nindicated at the beginning of this chapter. He can only repeat here\r\nhis belief that the so-called Indians, with their many divisions into\r\nnumerous linguistic families, were later comers to our shores than the\r\nprimitive population, whose development he has attempted to trace; that\r\nthe so-called “moundbuilders” were the ancestors of tribes found in the\r\noccupation of the soil; and that the Pueblos and the Aztecs were only\r\npeoples relatively farther advanced than the others.\r\n\r\nThe writer further thinks that these are propositions capable, if not\r\nof being demonstrated, at least of being made to appear in a very high\r\ndegree probable by means of authorities which will be found amply\r\nreferred to in other chapters of this volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Signature]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROGRESS OF OPINION RESPECTING THE ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY OF MAN IN\r\nAMERICA.\r\n\r\nBY THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE literature respecting the origin and early condition of the\r\nAmerican aborigines is very extensive; and, as a rule, especially\r\nin the earlier period, it is not characterized by much reserve in\r\nconnecting races by historical analogies.[1566] Few before Dr.\r\nRobertson, in discussing the problem, could say: “I have ventured to\r\ninquire without presuming to decide.”\r\n\r\nThe question was one that allured many of the earlier Spanish writers\r\nlike Herrera and Torquemada. Among the earlier English discussions is\r\nthat of Wm. Bourne in his _Booke called the Treasure for Travellers_\r\n(London, 1578), where a section is given to “The Peopling of America.”\r\nThe most famous of the early discussions of the various theories\r\nwas that of Gregorio Garciá, a missionary for twenty years in South\r\nAmerica, who reviewed the question in his _Origen de los Indios de\r\nel Nuevo Mundo_ (Valencia, 1607).[1567] He goes over the supposed\r\nnavigations of the Phœnicians, the identity of Peru with Solomon’s\r\nOphir, and the chances of African, Roman, and Jewish migrations,—only\r\nto reject them all, and to favor a coming of Tartars and Chinese.\r\nClavigero thinks his evidences the merest conjectures. E. Brerewood,\r\nin his _Enquiries touching the diversity of languages and religions_\r\n(London, 1632, 1635), claimed a Tartar origin. In New England, where\r\nmany were believers in the Jewish analogies, it is somewhat amusing to\r\nfind not long after this the quizzical Thomas Morton, with what seems\r\nlike mock gravity, finding the aboriginal source in “the scattered\r\nTrojans, after such time as Brutus departed from Latium.”[1568] The\r\nreader, however, is referred to other sections of the present volume\r\nfor the literature bearing upon the distinct ethnical connections of\r\nthe early American peoples.\r\n\r\nThe chief literary controversy over the question began in 1642,\r\nwhen Hugo Grotius published his _De Origine Gentium Americanarum\r\nDissertatio_ (Paris and Amsterdam, 1642).[1569] He argued that all\r\nNorth America except Yucatan (which had an Ethiopian stock) was peopled\r\nfrom the Scandinavian North; that the Peruvians were from China, and\r\nthat the Moluccans peopled the regions below Peru. Grotius aroused an\r\nantagonist in Johannes de Laet, whose challenge appeared the next year:\r\n_Joannis de Laet Antwerpiani notae ad dissertationem Hugonis Grotii\r\nde origine gentium Americanarum: et observationes aliquot ad meliorem\r\nindaginem difficillimæ illius quæstionis_ (Amsterdam, 1643).[1570]\r\nHe combated his brother Dutchman at all points, and contended that\r\nthe Scythian race furnished the predominant population of America.\r\nThe Spaniards went to the Canaries, and thence some of their vessels\r\ndrifted to Brazil. He is inclined to accept the story of Madoc’s\r\nWelshmen, and think it not unlikely that the people of the Pacific\r\nislands may have floated to the western coast of South America, and\r\nthat minor migrations may have come from other lands. He supports his\r\nviews by comparisons of the Irish, Gallic, Icelandic, Huron, Iroquois,\r\nand Mexican tongues.\r\n\r\nTo all this Grotius replied in a second _Dissertatio_, and De Laet\r\nagain renewed the attack: _Ioannis de Laet Antwerpiani responsio\r\nad dissertationem secundam Hvgonis Grotii, de origine gentium\r\nAmericanarum. Cum indice ad utrumque libellum_ (Amsterdam, 1644).[1571]\r\n\r\nDe Laet, not content with his own onset, incited another to take part\r\nin the controversy, and so George Horn (Hornius) published his _De\r\nOriginibus Americanis, libri quatuor_ (Hagæ Comitis, _i. e._ The Hague,\r\n1652; again, Hemipoli, _i. e._ Halberstadt, 1669).[1572] His view was\r\nthe Scythian one, but he held to later additions from the Phœnicians\r\nand Carthaginians on the Atlantic side, and from the Chinese on the\r\nPacific.\r\n\r\nFor the next fifty years there were a number of writers on the\r\nsubject, who are barely names to the present generation;[1573]\r\nbut towards the middle of the eighteenth century the question was\r\nconsidered in _The American Traveller_ (London, 1741), and by\r\nCharlevoix in his _Nouvelle France_ (1744). The author of an _Enquiry\r\ninto the Origin of the Cherokees_ (Oxford, 1762) makes them the\r\ndescendants of Meshek, son of Japhet. In 1767, however, the question\r\nwas again brought into the range of a learned and disputatious\r\ndiscussion, reviving all the arguments of Grotius, De Laet, and Horn,\r\nwhen E. Bailli d’Engel published his _Essai sur cette question: Quand\r\net comment l’America a-t-elle été peuplée d’hommes et d’Animaux?_ (5\r\nvols., Amsterdam, 1767, 2d ed., 1768). He argues for an antediluvian\r\norigin.[1574] The controversy which now followed was aroused by C.\r\nDe Pauw’s characterization of all American products, man, animals,\r\nvegetation, as degraded and inferior to nature in the old world, in\r\nan essay which passed through various editions, and was attacked and\r\ndefended in turn.[1575] An Italian, Count Carli, some years later,\r\ncontroverted De Pauw, and using every resource of mythology, tradition,\r\ngeology, and astronomy, claimed for the Americans a descent from the\r\nAtlantides.[1576] It was not till after reports had come from the Ohio\r\nValley of the extensive earthworks in that region that the question\r\nof the earlier peoples of America attracted much general attention\r\nthroughout America; and the most conspicuous spokesman was President\r\nStiles of Yale College, in an address which he delivered before the\r\nGeneral Assembly of Connecticut, in 1783, on the future of the new\r\nrepublic.[1577] In this, while arguing for the unity of the American\r\ntribes and for their affinity with the Tartars, he held to their being\r\nin the main the descendants of the Canaanites expelled by Joshua,\r\nwhether finding their way hither by the Asiatic route and establishing\r\nthe northern Sachemdoms, or coming in Phœnician ships across the\r\nAtlantic to settle Mexico and Peru.[1578] Lafitau in 1724 (_Mœurs de\r\nSauvages_) had contended for a Tartar origin. We have examples of the\r\nreasoning of a missionary in the views of the Moravian Loskiel, and of\r\na learned controversialist in the treatise of Fritsch, in 1794 and 1796\r\nrespectively.[1579]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN SMITH BARTON.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest American with a scientific training to discuss the\r\nquestion was a professor in the University of Pennsylvania, Benjamin\r\nSmith Barton, a man who acquired one of the best reputations in his\r\nday among Americans for studies in this and other questions of natural\r\nhistory. His father was an English clergyman settled in America,\r\nand his mother a sister of David Rittenhouse. It was while he was a\r\nstudent of medicine in Edinburgh that he first approached the subject\r\nof the origin of the Americans, in a little treatise on American\r\nAntiquities, which he never completed.[1580] His _Papers relating\r\nto certain American Antiquities_ (Philad., 1796) consists of those\r\nread to the Amer. Philos. Soc., and printed in their _Transactions_\r\n(vol. iv.). They were published as the earnest of his later work on\r\nAmerican Antiquities. He argues against De Pauw, and contends that the\r\nAmericans are descended—at least some of them—from Asiatic peoples\r\nstill recognized. The _Papers_ include a letter from Col. Winthrop\r\nSargent, Sept. 8, 1794, describing certain articles found in a mound\r\nat Cincinnati, and a letter upon them from Barton to Dr. Priestley.\r\nHe in the end gave more careful attention to the subject, mainly on\r\nits linguistic side, and went farther than any one had gone before him\r\nin his _New Views of the Origin of the Tribes and Nations of America_\r\n(Philad., 1797; 2d ed., enlarged, 1798).[1581] The book attracted\r\nmuch notice, and engaged the attention in some degree of European\r\nphilologists, and made Barton at that time the most conspicuous student\r\non these matters in America. Jefferson was at that time gathering\r\nmaterial in similar studies, but his collections were finally burned in\r\n1801. Barton, in dedicating his treatise to Jefferson, recognized the\r\nlatter’s advance in the same direction. He believed his own gathering\r\nof original MS. material to be at that time more extensive than any\r\nother student had collected in America. His views had something of the\r\ncomprehensiveness of his material, and he could not feel that he could\r\npoint to any one special source of the indigenous population.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the present century old theories and new were\r\nabundant. The powerful intellect and vast knowledge of Alexander von\r\nHumboldt were applied to the problem as he found it in Middle America.\r\nHe announced some views on the primitive peoples in 1806, in the _Neue\r\nBerlinische Monatsschrift_ (vol. xv.); but his ripened opinions found\r\nrecord in his _Vues de Cordillères et monumens des peuples indigènes de\r\nl’Amérique_ (Paris, 1816), and the Asiatic theory got a conservative\r\nyet definite advocate.\r\n\r\nHugh Williamson[1582] thought he found traces of the Hindoo in the\r\nhigher arts of the Mexicans, and marks of the ruder Asiatics in the\r\nmore northern American peoples. A conspicuous littérateur of the day,\r\nSamuel L. Mitchell, veered somewhat wildly about in his notions of\r\na Malay, Tartar, and Scandinavian origin.[1583] Meanwhile something\r\nlike organized efforts were making. The American Antiquarian Society\r\nwas formed in 1812.[1584] Silliman began his _Journal of Arts and\r\nSciences_ in 1819, and both society and periodical proved instruments\r\nof wider inquiry. In the first volume published by the Antiquarian\r\nSociety, Caleb Atwater, in his treatise on the Western Antiquities,\r\ngave the earliest sustained study of the subject, and believed in a\r\ngeneral rather than in a particular Asiatic source. The man first to\r\nattract attention for his grouping of ascertained results, unaided\r\nby personal explorations, however, was Dr. James H. McCulloh, who\r\npublished his _Researches on America_ at Baltimore in 1816. The book\r\npassed to a second edition the next year, but received its final shape\r\nin the _Researches, philosophical and antiquarian, concerning the\r\naboriginal history of America_ (1829), a book which Prescott[1585]\r\npraised for its accumulated erudition, and Haven[1586] ranked high for\r\nits manifestations of industry and research, calling it encyclopædic in\r\ncharacter. McCulloh examines the native traditions, but can evolve no\r\nsatisfactory conclusion from them as to the origin of the Americans.\r\nThe public mind, however, was not ripe for scholarly inquiry, and there\r\nwas not that in McCulloh’s style to invite attention; and greater\r\npopularity followed upon the fanciful and dogmatic confidence of\r\nJohn Haywood,[1587] upon the somewhat vivid if unsteady speculations\r\nof C. S. Rafinesque,[1588] and even upon the itinerant Josiah\r\nPriest, who boasted of the circulation of thousands of copies of his\r\npopular books.[1589] John Delafield’s _Inquiry into the Origin of\r\nthe Antiquities of America_ (N. Y., 1839) revived the theory, never\r\nquite dormant, of the descent of the Mexicans from the riper peoples\r\nof Hindostan and Egypt; while the more barbarous red men came of the\r\nMongol stock. The author ran through the whole range of philology,\r\nmythology, and many of the customs of the races, in reaching this\r\nconclusion. A little book by John McIntosh, _Discovery of America and\r\nOrigin of the North American Indians_, published in Toronto, 1836, was\r\nreissued in N. Y. in 1843, and with enlargements in 1846, _Origin of\r\nthe North American Indians_, continued down to 1859 to be repeatedly\r\nissued, or to have a seeming success by new dates.[1590]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Columbus, approaching the main land of South America, imagined\r\nit a large island, he associated it with that belief so long current\r\nin the Old World, which placed the cradle of the race in the Indian\r\nOcean,—a belief which in our day has been advocated by Haeckel,\r\nCaspari and Winchell,—and imagined he was on the coasts, skirting an\r\ninterior, where lay the Garden of Eden.[1591] No one had then ventured\r\non the belief that the doctrine of Genesis must be reconciled with\r\nany supposed counter-testimony by holding it to be but the record of\r\nthe Jewish race. Columbus was not long in his grave when Theophrastus\r\nParacelsus, in 1520, and before the belief in the continuity of North\r\nAmerica with Asia was dispelled, and consequently before the question\r\nof how man and animals could have reached the New World was raised,\r\nfirst broached the heterodox view of the plurality of the human\r\nrace. All the early disputants on the question of the origin of the\r\nAmerican man looked either across the Atlantic or the Pacific for the\r\nprimitive seed; nor was there any necessary connection between the\r\narguments for an autochthonous American man and a diversity of race,\r\nwhen Fabricius, in 1721, published his _Dissertatio Critica_[1592] on\r\nthe opinions of those who held that different races had been created.\r\nFrom that day the old orthodox interpretation of the record in Genesis\r\nfound no contestant of mark till the question came up in relation\r\nto the American man, it being held quite sufficient to account for\r\nthe inferiority or other distinguishing characteristics of race by\r\nassigning them to the influence of climate and physical causes.[1593]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS AGASSIZ.\r\n\r\nAfter a photograph, hanging in the Somerset Club, Boston; suggested to\r\nthe editor by Mr. Alexander Agassiz as a satisfactory likeness.]\r\n\r\nThe strongest presentation of the case, in considering the American\r\nman a distinct product of the American soil, with no connection with\r\nthe Old World[1594] except in the case of the Eskimos, was made when\r\nS. G. Morton, in 1839, printed his _Crania Americana, or a comparative\r\nview of the skulls of various aboriginal nations of North and South\r\nAmerica_, of which there was a second edition in 1844.[1595] Here\r\nwas a new test, and applied, very likely, in ignorance of the fact\r\nthat Governor Pownal, in 1766, in Knox’s _New Collection of Voyages_,\r\nhad suggested it.[1596] Dr. Morton had gathered a collection of near\r\na thousand skulls from all parts of the world,[1597] and based his\r\ndeductions on these,—a process hardly safe, as many of his successors\r\nhave determined.[1598] The views of Morton respecting the autochthonous\r\norigin of the Indian found an able upholder when Louis Agassiz,\r\ntaking the broader view of the independent creation of higher and\r\ninferior races,[1599] gave in his adhesion to the original American\r\nman (_Christian Examiner_, July, 1850, vol. xlix. p. 110). These\r\nviews got more extensive expression in a publication which appeared\r\nin Philadelphia in 1854, in which some unpublished papers of Morton\r\nare accompanied by a contribution from Agassiz, and all are grouped\r\ntogether and augmented by material of the editors, Dr. Josiah Clark\r\nNott[1600] of Mobile, and Mr. George R. Gliddon, long a resident in\r\nCairo. The _Types of Mankind, or Ethnological Researches_ (Philad.,\r\n1854, 1859, 1871), met with a divided reception; the conservative\r\ntheologians called it pretentious and false, and there was some color\r\nfor their detraction in some rather jejune expositions of the Hebrew\r\nScriptures contained in the book. The physiologists thought it brought\r\nnew vigor to a question which properly belonged to science.[1601] Other\r\nfresh material, with some discussions, made up a new book by the same\r\neditors, published three years later, _Indigenous Races of the Earth,\r\nor New Chapters of Ethnological Inquiry_ (Philad. and London, 1857; 2d\r\ned., 1857).[1602]\r\n\r\nThe theological attacks were not always void of a contempt that ill\r\nbefitted the work of refutation. The most important of them were John\r\nBachman’s _Doctrine of the Unity of the Human Race_ (Charleston, S. C.,\r\n1850), with his _Notice of the Types of Mankind_ (Charleston, 1854-55);\r\nand Thomas Smyth’s _Unity of the Human Race proved by Scripture, Reason\r\nand Science_ (N. Y., 1850).[1603]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAMUEL FOSTER HAVEN.\r\n\r\nAfter a photograph. A heliotype of a portrait by Custer is in the\r\n_Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, Ap., 1879. Haven’s _Annual Reports_, as\r\nlibrarian of the Amer. Antiq. Soc., furnish a good chronological\r\nconspectus of the progress of anthropological discovery.]\r\n\r\nThe scientific attack on Morton and Agassiz, and the views they\r\nrepresented, was an active one, and embraced such writers as Wilson,\r\nLatham, Pickering, and Quatrefages.[1604] The same collection of skulls\r\nwhich had furnished Morton with his proofs yielded exactly opposite\r\nevidence to Dr. J. A. Meigs in his _Observations upon the Cranial Forms\r\nof the American Aborigines_ (Philad., 1866).[1605] Two of the most\r\ncelebrated of the evolutionists reject the autochthonous view, for\r\nDarwin’s _Descent of Man_ and Haeckel’s _Hist. of Creation_ consider\r\nthe American man an emigrant from the old world, in whatever way the\r\nrace may have developed.[1606]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR DANIEL WILSON, LL. D., F.R.S.E.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph kindly furnished, on request, by Professor Wilson’s\r\nfamily.]\r\n\r\nOf the leading historians of the early American peoples, Prescott,\r\ndealing with the Mexicans, is inclined to agree with Humboldt’s\r\narguments as to their primitive connection with Asia.[1607] Geo.\r\nBancroft, in the third volume of his _Hist. of the United States_\r\n(1840), surveying the field, found little in the linguistic affinities,\r\nlittle in what Humboldt gathered from the Mexican calendars and from\r\nother developments, nothing from the Western mounds, which he was sure\r\nwere natural earth-knobs and water-worn passages,[1608] and decides\r\nupon some transmission by the Pacific route from Asia, but so remote\r\nas to make the American tribes practically indigenous, so far as their\r\ncharacter is concerned.\r\n\r\nIn 1843 another compiler of existing evidence appeared in Alexander W.\r\nBradford in his _American Antiquities, or Researches into the origin\r\nand history of the Red Race_. His views were new. He connects the\r\nhigher organized life of middle America with the corresponding culture\r\nof Southern Asia, the Polynesian islands probably furnishing the avenue\r\nof migrations; while the ruder and more northern peoples of both shores\r\nof the Pacific represent the same stock degraded by northern migrations.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 the American Ethnological Society began its publications, and\r\nin Albert Gallatin it had a vigorous helper in unravelling some of\r\nthese mysteries. A few years later (1853) the United States government\r\nlent its patronage and prestige to the huge conglomerate publication of\r\nSchoolcraft, his _Indian Tribes of the United States_, which leaves the\r\nbewildered reader in a puzzling maze,—the inevitable result of a work\r\nundertaken beyond the ambitious powers of an untrained mind. The work\r\nis not without value if the user of it has more systematic knowledge\r\nthan its compiler, to select, discard, and arrange, and if he can weigh\r\nthe importance of the separate papers.[1609]\r\n\r\nIn 1856 Samuel F. Haven, the librarian and guiding spirit of the\r\nAmerican Antiquarian Society, summed up, as it had never been done\r\nbefore, for comprehensiveness, and with a striking prescience, the\r\nprogress and results of studies in this field, in his _Archæology of\r\nthe United States_ (_Smithsonian Contributions_, viii., Washington,\r\n1856).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDWARD B. TYLOR.\r\n\r\nAfter a photograph.]\r\n\r\nIn 1851 Professor Daniel Wilson, in his _Prehistoric Annals of\r\nScotland_, first brought into use the designation “prehistoric” as\r\nexpressing “the whole period disclosed to us by means of archæological\r\nevidence, as distinguished from what is known through written records;\r\nand in this sense the term was speedily adopted by the archæologists\r\nof Europe.”[1610] Eleven years later he published his _Prehistoric\r\nMan: Researches into the origin of civilization in the old and new\r\nworld_.[1611] The book unfortunately is not well fortified with\r\nreferences, but it is the result of long study, partly in the field,\r\nand written with a commendable reserve of judgment. It is in the main\r\nconcerned with the western hemisphere, which he assumes with little\r\nhesitation “began its human period subsequent to that of the old world,\r\nand so started later in the race of civilization.” While thus in effect\r\na study of early man in America, its scope makes it in good degree a\r\ncomplement to the _Origin of Civilization_ of Lubbock.\r\n\r\nThe comparative study of ethnological traces, to enable us to depict\r\nthe earliest condition of human society, owes a special indebtedness\r\nto Edward B. Tylor, among writers in English. It is nearly twenty-five\r\nyears since he first published his _Researches into the Early History\r\nof Mankind and the Development of Civilization_,[1612] the work\r\nalmost, if not quite, of a pioneer in this interesting field, and he\r\nhas supplied the reader with all the references necessary to test his\r\nexamples. Max Müller (_Chips_, ii. 262) has pointed out how he has\r\nvitalized his vast accumulation of facts by coherent classifications\r\ninstead of leaving them an oppressive burden by simple aggregation, as\r\nhis precursors in Germany, Gustav Klemm[1613] and Adolf Bastian, had\r\ndone; and it is remarked that while thus classifying, he has not been\r\nlured into pronounced theory, which future accession of material might\r\nserve to modify or change. He shortly afterwards touched a phase of the\r\nsubject which he had not developed in his book in a paper on “Traces of\r\nthe Early Mental Condition of Man,”[1614] and illustrated the methods\r\nhe was pursuing in another on “The Condition of Prehistoric Races as\r\ninferred from observations of modern tribes.”[1615]\r\n\r\nThe postulate of which he has been a distinguished expounder, that man\r\nhas progressed from barbarism to civilization, was a main deduction\r\nto be drawn from his next sustained work, _Primitive Culture:\r\nresearches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion,\r\nart, and custom_.[1616] The chief points of this further study of\r\nthe thought, belief, art, and custom of the primitive man had been\r\nadvanced tentatively in various other papers beside those already\r\nmentioned,[1617] and in this new work he further acknowledges his\r\nobligations to Adolf Bastian’s _Mensch in der Geschichte_ and Theodor\r\nWaitz’s _Anthropologie der Naturvölker_.[1618] He still pursued his\r\nplan of collecting wide and minute evidence from the writers on\r\nethnography and kindred sciences, and from historians, travellers, and\r\nmissionaries, as his foot-notes abundantly testify.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEODOR WAITZ.\r\n\r\nAfter a likeness in Otto Caspari’s _Urgeschichte der Menschheit_, 2d\r\ned., vol. i. (Leipzig, 1877).]\r\n\r\nThese studies of Professor Tylor abundantly qualified him to give\r\na condensed exposition of the science of anthropology, which he had\r\ndone so much to place within the range of scientific studies, by a\r\nprimary search for facts and laws; and having contributed the article\r\non that subject to the ninth edition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_,\r\nhe published in 1881 his _Anthropology: an Introduction to the study\r\nof man and civilization_ (London and N. Y., 1881 and 1888). He maps\r\nout the new science, which has now received of late years so many new\r\nstudents in the scientific method, without references, but with the\r\nauthority of a teacher, tracing what man has been and is under the\r\ndifferences of sex, race, beliefs, habits, and society.[1619] Again,\r\nat the Montreal meeting (August, 1884) of the British Association for\r\nthe Advancement of Science, he set down in an address the bounds of the\r\n“American Aspects of Anthropology.”[1620]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JOHN LUBBOCK.\r\n\r\nAfter a photograph.]\r\n\r\nClosely following upon Tylor in this field, and gathering his material\r\nwith much the same assiduity, and presenting it with similar beliefs,\r\nthough with enough individuality to mark a distinction, was another\r\nEnglishman, who probably shares with Tylor the leading position in\r\nthis department of study. Sir John Lubbock, in his _Prehistoric Times\r\nas illustrated by ancient remains, and the manners and customs of\r\nmodern savages_,[1621] gathered the evidence which exists of the\r\nprimitive condition of man, embracing some chapters on modern savages\r\nso far as they are ignorant of the use of metals, as the best study\r\nwe can follow, to fill out the picture of races only archæologically\r\nknown to us. This study of modern savage life, in arts, marriages,\r\nand relationships, morals, religion, and laws, is, as he holds, a\r\nnecessary avenue to the knowledge of a condition of the early man,\r\nfrom which by various influences the race has advanced to what is\r\ncalled civilization. His result in this comparative study—not indeed\r\ncovering all the phases of savage life—he made known in his _Origin\r\nof Civilization and the Primitive Condition of Man_.[1622] While\r\nreferring to Tylor’s _Early Hist. of Mankind_ as more nearly like\r\nhis own than any existing treatise, but showing, as compared with\r\nhis own book, “that no two minds would view the subject in the same\r\nmanner,” he instanced previous treatments of certain phases of the\r\nsubject, like Müller’s _Geschichte der Amerikanischen Urreligionen_,\r\nJ. F. M’Lennan’s _Primitive Marriage_,[1623] and J. J. Bachofen’s _Das\r\nMutterrecht_ (Stuttgart, 1861); and even Lord Kames’ _History of Man_,\r\nand Montesquieu’s _Esprit des Lois_, notwithstanding the absence in\r\nthem of much of the minute knowledge now necessary to the study of the\r\nsubject. These data, of course, are largely obtained from travellers\r\nand missionaries, and Lubbock complains of their unsatisfactory extent\r\nand accuracy. “Travellers,” he adds, “find it easier to describe the\r\nhouses, boats, food, dress, weapons, and implements of savages than to\r\nunderstand their thoughts and feelings.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR JOHN WILLIAM DAWSON.\r\n\r\nAfter a photograph.]\r\n\r\nThe main controversial point arising out of all this study is the one\r\nalready adverted to,—whether man has advanced from savagery to his\r\npresent condition, or has preserved, with occasional retrogressions,\r\nhis original elevated character; and this causes the other question,\r\nwhether the modern savage is the degenerate descendant of the same\r\ncivilized first men. “There is no scientific evidence which would\r\njustify us,” says Lubbock (_Prehist. Times_, 417), “in asserting that\r\nthis kind of degradation applies to savages in general.”[1624] The\r\nmost distinguished advocate of the affirmative of this proposition is\r\nRichard Whately, Archbishop of Dublin, both in his _Political Economy_\r\nand in his lecture on the _Origin of Civilization_ (1855), in which\r\nhe undertook to affirm that no nation, unaided by a superior race,\r\never succeeded in raising itself out of savagery, and that nations\r\ncan become degraded. Lubbock, who, with Tylor, holds the converse of\r\nthis proposition, answered Whately in an appendix to his _Origin of\r\nCivilization_, which was originally given as a paper at the Dundee\r\nmeeting of the British Association.[1625] The Duke of Argyle, while\r\nnot prepared to go to the extent of Whately’s views, attacked, in his\r\n_Primeval Man_, Lubbock’s argument,[1626] and was in turn reviewed\r\nadversely by Lubbock, in a paper read at the Exeter meeting of the\r\nsame association (1869), which is also included in the appendix of his\r\n_Origin of Civilization_. Lubbock seems to show, in some instances at\r\nleast, that the duke did not possess himself correctly of some of the\r\nviews of his opponents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIGRATIONS.\r\n\r\nA sketch map given in Dawson’s _Fossil Men_, p. 48, showing his view\r\nof the probable lines of migration and distribution of the American\r\ntribes. Morgan (_Ancient Society_) makes what he calls three centres\r\nof subsistence, whence the migration proceeded which overran America.\r\nCf. Hellwald in _Smithsonian Rept._, 1866, p. 328. The question is\r\nmore or less discussed in Latham’s _Man and his migrations_ (London,\r\n1851); Chas. Pickering’s _Men and their geog. distribution_; and Oscar\r\nPeschel’s _Races of Man_ (Eng. transl., London, 1876). On the passage\r\nfrom the valley of the Columbia to that of the Missouri, see Humboldt’s\r\n_Views of Nature_, 35. Morgan (_No. Am. Rev._, cix.) supposes the\r\nvalley of the Columbia River to be the original centre where the\r\nstreams diverged, and (_Systems of Consanguinity_, 251) says there\r\nare reasons for believing that the Shoshone migration was the last\r\nwhich left the Columbia valley, and that it was pending at the epoch\r\nof European colonization. Morgan’s papers in the _No. Am. Rev._, Oct.\r\n1868 and Jan. 1870, are reprinted in Beach’s _Indian Miscellany_, p.\r\n158. On a general belief in a migration from the north, see _Congrès\r\ndes Amér_. (1877), ii. 50, 51. L. Simonin, in “L’homme Américain, notes\r\nd’ethnologie et de linguistique sur les indiens des Etats-Unis,” gives\r\na map of the tribes of North America in the _Bull. de la Soc. de Géog._\r\nFeb. 1870.]\r\n\r\nIn the researches of Tylor and Lubbock, and of all the others\r\ncited above, the American Indian is the source of many of their\r\nillustrations. Of all writers on this continent, Sir John Wm. Dawson\r\nin his _Fossil Men_, and Southall in his _Recent Origin of Man_, are\r\nprobably the most eminent advocates of the views of Whately and Argyle,\r\nhowever modified, and both have declared it an unfounded assumption\r\nthat the primitive man was a savage.[1627] Morgan, in his _Ancient\r\nSociety_ (N. Y., 1877), has, on the other hand, sketched the lines of\r\nhuman progress from savagery through barbarism to civilization.\r\n\r\nOne of the defenders of the supposed Bible limits best equipped by\r\nreading, if not in the scientific spirit, has been a Virginian, James\r\nC. Southall, who published a large octavo in 1875, _The Recent Origin\r\nof Man as illustrated by geology and the modern science of prehistoric\r\narchæology_ (Philad., 1875). Three years later,—leaving out some\r\nirrelevant matters as touching the antiquity of man, condensing his\r\ncollations of detail, sparing the men of science an attack for what in\r\nhis earlier volume he called their fickleness, and somewhat veiling\r\nhis set purpose of sustaining the Bible record,—he published a more\r\neffective little book, _The Epoch of the Mammoth and the Apparition of\r\nMan upon Earth_ (Philad., 1878). Barring its essentially controversial\r\ncharacter, and waiving judgment on its scientific decisions, it is one\r\nof the best condensed accumulations of data which has been made. His\r\nbelief in the literal worth of the Bible narrative is emphatic. He\r\nthinks that man, abruptly and fully civilized, appeared in the East,\r\nand gave rise to the Egyptian and Babylonian civilization, while the\r\nestrays that wandered westward are known to us by their remains, as\r\nthe early savage denizens of Europe. To maintain this existence of the\r\nhunter-man of Europe within historic times, he rejects the prevailing\r\nopinions of the geologists and archæologists. He reverses the judgment\r\nthat Lyell expresses (_Student’s Elements of Geology_, Am. ed., 162)\r\nof the historical period as not affording any appreciable measure\r\nfor calculating the number of centuries necessary to produce so many\r\nextinct animals, to deepen and widen valleys, and to lay so deep\r\nstalagmite floors, and says it does. He contends that the stone age is\r\nnot divided into the earlier and later periods with an interval, but\r\nthat the mingling of the kinds of flints shows but different phases of\r\nthe same period,[1628] and that what others call the palæolithic man\r\nwas in reality the quaternary man, with conditions not much different\r\nfrom now.[1629] The time when the ice retreated from the now temperate\r\nregions he holds to have been about 2000 b.c., and he looks to the\r\nproofs of the action of which traces are left along the North American\r\ngreat lakes, as observed by Professor Edmund Andrews[1630] of Chicago,\r\nto confirm his judgment of the Glacial age being from 5,300 to 7,500\r\nyears ago.[1631] He claims that force has not been sufficiently\r\nrecognized as an element in geological action, and that a great lapse\r\nof time was not necessary to effect geological changes (_Ep. of the\r\nM._, 194).[1632] He thinks the present drift of opinion, carrying\r\nback the appearance of man anywhere from 20,000 to 9,000,000 years,\r\na mere fashion. The gravel of the Somme has been, he holds, a rapid\r\ndeposit in valleys already formed and not necessarily old. The peat\r\nbeds were a deposit from the flood that followed the glacial period,\r\nand accumulated rapidly (_Ep. of the M._, ch. 10). The extinct animals\r\nfound with the tools of man in the caves simply show that such beasts\r\nsurvived to within historic times, as seems everywhere apparent as\r\nregards the mastodon when found in America. The stalagmites of the\r\ncaves are of unequal growth, and it is an assumption to give them\r\nuniformly great age. The finely worked flints found among those called\r\npalæolithic; the skilfully free drawings of the cave-men; the bits of\r\npottery discovered with the rude flints, and the great similarity of\r\nthe implements to those in use to-day among the Eskimos; the finding\r\nof Roman coin in the Danish shell heaps and an English one in those of\r\nAmerica (_Proc. Philad. Acad. Nat. Sci._, 1866, p. 291),—are all parts\r\nof the argument which satisfies him that the archæologists have been\r\nhasty and inconclusive in their deductions. They in turn will dispute\r\nboth his facts and conclusions.[1633]\r\n\r\nSouthall’s arraignment of the opinions generally held may introduce us\r\nto a classification of the data upon which archæologists rely to reach\r\nconclusions upon the antiquity of man, and over some of which there is\r\ncertainly no prevailing consensus of opinion. We may find a condensed\r\nsummary of beliefs and data respecting the antiquity of man in J. P.\r\nMaclean’s _Manual of the Antiquity of Man_ (Cincinnati, revised ed.,\r\n1877; again, 1880).[1634] The independent view and conservative spirit\r\nare placed respectively in juxtaposition in J. P. Lesley’s _Origin and\r\nDecline of Man_ (ch. 3), and in Dawson’s _Fossil Men_ (ch. 8).[1635]\r\nThe opinions of leading English archæologists are found in Lubbock’s\r\n_Prehistoric Times_ (ch. 12), Wallace’s _Tropical Nature_ (ch. 7), and\r\nHuxley’s “Distribution of Races in Relation to the Antiquity of Man,”\r\nin _Internat. Cong. of Prehist. Archæol. Trans._ (1868). Dawkins has\r\ngiven some recent views in _The Nation_, xxvi. 434, and in _Kansas City\r\nReview_, vii. 344.[1636] Not to refer to special phases, the French\r\nschool will be found represented in Nadaillac’s _Les Premiers Hommes_\r\n(ii. ch. 13); in Gabriel de Mortillet’s _La préhistorique antiquité\r\nde l’homme_ (Paris, 1883); Hamy’s _Précis de paléontologie humaine_;\r\nLe Hon’s _L’homme fossile_ (1867); Victor Meunier’s _Les Ancêtres\r\nd’Adam_ (Paris, 1875); Joly’s _L’homme avant métaux_ (Eng. transl.\r\n_Man before Metals_, N. Y., 1883); _Revue des Questions historiques_\r\n(vol. xvi.). The German school is represented in Haeckel’s _Natürliche\r\nSchöpfungsgeschichte_; Waitz’s _Anthropologie_; Carl Vogt’s _Lectures\r\non Man_ (Eng. transl., Lond., 1864); and L. Büchner’s _Der Mensch und\r\nseine Stellung in der Natur_ (2d ed., Leipzig, 1872; or W. S. Dallas’s\r\nEng. translation, Lond., 1872). The history of the growth of geological\r\nantagonism to the biblical record as once understood, and the several\r\nmethods proposed for reconciling their respective teaching, is traced\r\nconcisely in the article on geology in M’Clintock and Strong’s\r\n_Cyclopædia_, with references for further examination. The views there\r\ngiven are those propounded by Chalmers in 1804, that the geological\r\nrecord, ignored in the account of Genesis, finds its place in that book\r\nbetween the first and second verses,[1637] which have no dependence on\r\none another, and that the biblical account of creation followed in six\r\nliteral days. What may be considered the present theological attitude\r\nof churchmen may be noted in _The Speaker’s Commentary_ (N. Y. ed.,\r\n1871, p. 61).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question of the territorial connection of America with Asia under\r\nearlier geological conditions is necessarily considered in some of the\r\ndiscussions on the transplanting of the American man from the side of\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nOtto Caspari in his _Urgeschichte der Menschheit_ (Leipzig, 1873), vol.\r\ni., gives a map of Asia and America in the post-tertiary period, as he\r\nunderstands it, which stretches the Asiatic and African continents over\r\na large part of the Indian Ocean; and in this region, now beneath the\r\nsea, he places the home of the primeval man, and marks the lines of\r\nmigration east, north, and west. This view is accepted by Winchell in\r\nhis _Preadamites_ (see his map). Haeckel (_Nat. Schöpfungsgeschichte_,\r\n1868, 1873; Eng. transl. 1876) calls this region “Lemuria” in his map.\r\nCaspari places large continental islands between this region and South\r\nAmerica, which rendered migration to South America easy. The eastern\r\nshore of the present Asia is extended beyond the Japanese islands,\r\nand similar convenient islands render the passage by other lines of\r\nimmigration easy to the regions of British Columbia and of Mexico. (Cf.\r\nShort, 507; Baldwin, App.) Howorth, _Mammoth and the Flood_, supposes a\r\nconnection at Behring’s Straits. The supposed similarity of the flora\r\nof the two shores of the Pacific has been used to support this theory,\r\nbut botanists say that the language of Hooker and Gray has been given a\r\nmeaning they did not intend. It is opposed by many eminent geologists.\r\nA. R. Wallace (_Journal Amer. Geog. Soc._, xix.) finds no ground to\r\nbelieve that any of the oceans contain sunken continents. (Cf. his\r\n_Geographical Distribution of Animals_ and his _Malay Archipelago_.)\r\nJames Croll in his _Climate and Cosmology_ (p. 6) says: “There is no\r\ngeological evidence to show that at least since Silurian times the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific were ever in their broad features otherwise than\r\nthey now are.”[1638] Hyde Clarke has examined the legend of Atlantis in\r\nreference to protohistoric communication with America, in _Royal Hist.\r\nSoc. Trans._, n. s., iii. p. 1.[1639]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe arguments for the great antiquity of man[1640] are deduced in the\r\nmain from the testimony of the river gravels, the bone caves, the peat\r\ndeposits, the shell heaps, and the Lacustrine villages, for the mounds\r\nand other relics of defence, habitation, and worship are very likely\r\nnot the records of a great antiquity. The whole field is surveyed with\r\nmore fullness than anywhere else, and with a faith in the geological\r\nantiquity of the race, in Sir Charles Lyell’s _Geological Evidences of\r\nthe Antiquity of Man_.[1641] With as firm a belief in the integrity of\r\nthe biblical record, and in its not being impugned by the discoveries\r\nor inductions of science, we find a survey in Southall’s _Recent Origin\r\nof Man_. These two books constitute the extremes of the methods,\r\nboth for and against the conservative interpretation of the Bible.\r\nThe independent spirit of the scientist is nowhere more confidently\r\nexpressed than by J. P. Lesley (_Man’s Origin and Destiny_, Philad.,\r\n1868, p. 45), who says: “There is no alliance possible between Jewish\r\ntheology and modern science.... Geologists have won the right to be\r\nChristians without first becoming Jews.” Southall[1642] interprets\r\nthis spirit in this wise: “I do not recollect that the _Antiquity of\r\nMan_ ever recognizes that the book of Genesis is in existence; and yet\r\nevery one is perfectly conscious that the author has it in mind, and\r\nis writing at it all the time.”[1643] The entire literature of the\r\nscientific interpretation shows that the canons of criticism are not\r\nyet secure enough to prevent the widest interpretations and inferences.\r\n\r\nThe intimations which are supposed to exist in the Bible of a race\r\nearlier than Adam have given rise to what is called the theory of\r\nthe Preadamites, and there is little noteworthy upon it in European\r\nliterature back of Isaac de La Peyrère’s _Praeadamitae_ (Paris and\r\nAmsterdam, 1655), whose views were put into English in _Man before\r\nAdam_ (London, 1656).[1644] The advocates of the theory from that day\r\nto this are enumerated in Alexander Winchell’s _Preadamites_ (Chicago,\r\n1880), and this book is the best known contribution to the subject by\r\nan American author. It is his opinion that the aboriginal American,\r\nwith the Mongoloids in general, comes from some descendant of Adam\r\nearlier than Noah, and that the black races come from a stock earlier\r\nthan Adam, whom Cain found when he went out of his native country.[1645]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe investigations of the great antiquity of man in America fall far\r\nshort in extent of those which have been given to his geological\r\nremoteness in Europe; and yet, should we believe with Winchell that the\r\nAmerican man represents the pre-Adamite, while the European man does\r\nnot, we might reasonably hope to find in America earlier traces of the\r\ngeological man, if, as Agassiz shows, the greater age of the American\r\ncontinent weighs in the question.[1646]\r\n\r\nThe explicit proofs, as advanced by different geologists, to give a\r\ngreat antiquity to the American man, and perhaps in some ways greater\r\nthan to the European man,[1647] may now be briefly considered in detail.\r\n\r\nOldest of all may perhaps be placed the gold-drift of California, with\r\nits human remains, and chief among them the Calaveras skull, which is\r\nclaimed to be of the Pliocene (tertiary) age; but it must be remembered\r\nthat Powell and the government geologists call it quaternary. It\r\nwas in February, 1866, that in a mining shaft in Calaveras County,\r\nCalifornia, a hundred and thirty feet below the surface, a skull\r\nwas found imbedded in gravel, which under the name of the Calaveras\r\nskull has excited much interest. It was not the first time that human\r\nremains had been found in these California gravels, but it was the\r\nfirst discovery that attracted notice. It was not seen _in situ_ by a\r\nprofessional geologist, and a few weeks elapsed before Professor Josiah\r\nDwight Whitney, then state geologist of California, visited the spot,\r\nand satisfied himself that the geological conditions were such as to\r\nmake it certain that the skull and the deposition of the gravel were\r\nof the same age. The relic subsequently passed into the possession of\r\nProfessor Whitney, and the annexed cut is reproduced from the careful\r\ndrawing made of it for the _Memoirs of the Museum of Comp. Zoölogy_\r\n(Harvard University), vol. vi. He had published earlier an account in\r\nthe _Revue d’Anthropologie_ (1872), p. 760.[1648] This interesting\r\nrelic is now in Cambridge, coated with thin wax for preservation, but\r\nthis coating interferes with any satisfactory photograph. The volume of\r\n_Memoirs_ above named is made up of Whitney’s _Auriferous Gravels of\r\nthe Sierra Nevada of California_ (1880), and at p. ix he says: “There\r\nwill undoubtedly be much hesitancy on the part of anthropologists and\r\nothers in accepting the results regarding the Tertiary Age of man, to\r\nwhich our investigations seem so clearly to point.” He says that those\r\nwho reject the evidence of the Calaveras skull because it was not seen\r\n_in situ_ by a scientific observer forget the evidence of the fossil\r\nitself; and he adds that since 1866 the other evidence for tertiary\r\nman has so accumulated that “it would not be materially weakened by\r\ndropping that furnished by the Calaveras skull itself.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALAVERAS SKULL. (_Front and side view._)]\r\n\r\nWhat Whitney says of the history and authenticity of the skull will\r\nbe found in his paper on “Human remains and works of art of the\r\ngravel series,” in _Ibid._ pp. 258-288. His conclusions are that it\r\nshows the existence of man with an extinct fauna and flora, and under\r\ngeographical and physical conditions differing from the present,—in\r\nthe Pliocene age certainly. This opinion has obtained the support of\r\nMarsh and Le Conte and other eminent geologists. Schmidt (_Archiv\r\nfür Anthropologie_) thinks it signifies a pre-glacial man. Winchell\r\n(_Preadamites_, 428) says it is the best authenticated evidence of\r\nPliocene man yet adduced. On the contrary, there are some confident\r\ndoubters. Dawkins (_No. Am. Rev._, Oct., 1883) thinks that all but a\r\nfew American geologists have given up the Pliocene man, and that the\r\nchances of later interments, of accidents, of ancient mines, and the\r\npresence of skulls of mustang ponies (introduced by the Spaniards)\r\nfound in the same gravels, throw insuperable doubts. “Neither in the\r\nnew world nor the old world,” he says, “is there any trace of Pliocene\r\nman revealed by modern discovery.” Southall and all the Bible advocates\r\nof course deny the bearing of all such evidence. Dawson (_Fossil\r\nMen_, 345) thinks the arguments of Whitney inconclusive. Nadaillac\r\n(_L’Amérique préhistorique_, 40, with a cut, and his _Les Premiers\r\nHommes_, ii. 435) hesitates to accept the evidence, and enumerates the\r\ndoubters.[1649]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFootprints have been found in a tufa bed, resting on yellow sand, in\r\nthe neighborhood of an extinct volcano, Tizcapa, in Nicaragua. One of\r\nthe prints is shown in the annexed cut, after a representation given\r\nby Dr. Brinton in the _Amer. Philosoph. Soc. Proc._ (xxiv. 1887, p.\r\n437). Above this tufa bed were fourteen distinct strata of deposits\r\nbefore the surface soil was reached. Geologists have placed this yellow\r\nsand, bearing shells, from the post-Pliocene to the Eocene. The seventh\r\nstratum, going downwards, had remains of the mastodon.[1650]\r\n\r\nSome ancient basket work discovered at Petit Anse Island, in Louisiana,\r\nhas been figured in the _Chicago Acad. of Sciences, Transactions_ (i.\r\npart 2). Cf. E. W. Hilgard, in _Smithsonian Contributions_, no. 248.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFoster rather strikingly likens what we know of the history of the\r\nhuman race to the apex of a pyramid, of which we know neither the\r\nheight nor extent of base. Our efforts to trace man back to his\r\nbeginning would be like following down the sides of that pyramid till\r\nit reaches a firm base, we know not where. Many geologists believe\r\nin a great ice-sheet which at one time had settled upon the northern\r\nparts of America, and covered it down to a line that extends across\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and westerly in a direction of some variableness.\r\nThere are some, like Sir William Dawson,[1651] who reject the evidence\r\nthat persuades others. Prof. Whitney (_Climatic Changes_, 387) holds\r\nthat it was a local phenomenon confined in America to the northeastern\r\nparts. The advocates look to Dr. James Geikie[1652] as having\r\ncorrelated the proofs of the proposition as well as any, while writers\r\nlike Howorth[1653] trace the resulting phenomena largely to a flood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT FOOTPRINT FROM NICARAGUA.]\r\n\r\nHow long ago this was, the cautious geologist does not like to\r\nsay;[1654] nor is he quite ready to aver what it all means.[1655]\r\nPerhaps, as some theorize, this prevailing ice showed the long winter\r\nbrought about by the precession of the equinoxes, as has long been a\r\nfavorite belief, with the swing of ten thousand years, more or less,\r\nfrom one extreme to the other.[1656]\r\n\r\nOthers believe that we must look back 200,000 years, as James\r\nCroll[1657] and Lubbock do, or 800,000 and more, as Lyell did at first,\r\nand find the cause in the variable eccentricity of the earth’s orbit,\r\nwhich shall account for all the climatic changes since the dawn of\r\nwhat is called the glacial epoch, accompanying the deflection of ocean\r\ncurrents, as Croll supposes, or the variations in the disposition of\r\nsea and land, as Lyell imagines.[1658] This great ice-sheet, however\r\nextensive, began for some reason to retreat, at a period as remote,\r\naccording as we accept this or the other estimate, as from ten thousand\r\nto a hundred thousand years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat the objects of stone, shaped and polished, which had been observed\r\nall over the civilized world, were celestial in origin seems to have\r\nbeen the prevalent opinion,[1659] when Mahudel in 1723 and even when\r\nBuffon in 1778 ventured to assign to them a human origin.[1660]\r\n\r\nIn the gravels which were deposited by the melting of this more or\r\nless extended ice-sheet, parts of the human frame and the work of\r\nhuman hands have been found, and mark the anterior limit of man’s\r\nresidence on the globe, so far as we can confidently trace it.[1661]\r\nFew geologists have any doubt about the existence of human relics in\r\nthese American glacial drifts, however widely they may differ about the\r\nage of them.[1662]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM DAWSON’S FOSSIL MEN.\r\n\r\nThe outer outline is that of the skull found in the cave of Cro-magnon,\r\nin France, belonging, as Dawson says, p. 189, to one of the oldest\r\nhuman inhabitants of western Europe, as shown in Lartet and Christy’s\r\n_Reliquiae Aquitanicae_. The second outline is that of the Enghis\r\nskull; the dotted outline that of the Neanderthal skull. The shaded\r\nskull is on a smaller scale, but preserving the true outline, and is\r\none of the Hochelaga Indians (site of Montreal). Cuts of the Enghis\r\nand Neanderthal skulls are given in Lubbock’s _Prehistoric Times_,\r\npp. 328, 329. Dawkins (_Cave Hunters_, 235) thinks the Enghis skull\r\nof doubtful age. On the Neanderthal skull see Quatrefages and Hamy,\r\n_Crania Ethnica_ (Paris, 1873-75), and Dawkins (p. 240). Huxley gives\r\nit a great antiquity, and says it is the most ape-like one he ever\r\nsaw. Quatrefages, _Hommes fossiles_, etc. (1884), says it is not below\r\nsome later men. Southall (_Epoch of the Mammoth_, 80) says it has the\r\naverage capacity of the negro, and double that of the gorilla, and\r\ndoubts its antiquity.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the _American Naturalist_ (Mar. and Ap., 1872) that Dr.\r\nC. C. Abbott made an early communication respecting the discovery of\r\nrude human implements in the glacial gravels[1663] of the Delaware\r\nvalley, and since then the Trenton gravels have been the subject of\r\nmuch interest. The rudeness of the flints has repeatedly raised doubts\r\nas to their artificial character; but Wilson (_Prehistoric Man_, i.\r\n29) says that it is impossible to find in flints broken for the road,\r\nor in any other accumulation of rocky débris, a single specimen that\r\nlooks like the rudest implement of the drift. Experts attest the exact\r\ncorrespondence of these Trenton tools with those of the European river\r\ndrift. Abbott has explained the artificial cleavages of stone in the\r\n_American Antiquarian_ (viii. 43). There are geologists like Shaler\r\nwho question the artificial character of the Trenton implements. From\r\ntime to time since this early announcement, Dr. Abbott has made public\r\nadditional evidence as he has accumulated it, going to show, as he\r\nthinks, that we have in these deposits of the glacial action the signs\r\nof men contemporary with the glacial flow, and earlier than the red\r\nIndian stock of historic times.[1664] He summarizes the matter in his\r\n“Palæolithic implements of a people on the Atlantic coast anterior to\r\nthe Indians,” in his _Primitive Industry_ (1882).[1665]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome discoveries of human bones in the loess or loam of the Mississippi\r\nValley have not been generally accepted. Lyell (_Second Visit_, ii.\r\n197; _Antiq. of Man_, 203) suspends judgment, as does Joseph Leidy in\r\nhis _Extinct Mammalia of North America_ (p. 365).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe existence of man in western Europe with extinct animals is a\r\nbelief that, from the incredulity which accompanied the discovery by\r\nKemp in London, in 1714, of a stone hatchet lying in contiguity to some\r\nelephant’s teeth,[1666] has long passed into indisputable fact, settled\r\nby the exploration of cave and shell heaps.[1667] In North America,\r\nthis conjunction of man’s remains with those of the mastodon is very\r\nwidely spread.[1668] The geological evidence is quite sufficient\r\nwithout resorting to what has been called an Elephant’s head in the\r\narchitecture of Palenqué, the so-called Elephant Mound in Wisconsin,\r\nand the dubious if not fraudulent Elephant Pipe of Iowa.[1669] The\r\npositions of the skeletons have led many to believe that the interval\r\nsince the mastodon ceased to roam in the Mississippi Valley is not\r\ngeologically great. Shaler (_Amer. Naturalist_, iv. 162) places it at\r\na few thousand years, and there is enough ground for it perhaps to\r\njustify Southall (_Recent Origin, etc._, 551; _Ep. of the Mammoth_, ch.\r\n8) in claiming that these animals have lived into historic times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA human skeleton was found sixteen feet below the surface, near New\r\nOrleans—(which is only nine feet above the Gulf of Mexico), and under\r\nfour successive growths of cypress forests. Its antiquity, however,\r\nis questioned.[1670] The belief in human traces in the calcareous\r\nconglomerate of Florida seems to have been based (Haven, p. 87) on a\r\nmisconception of Count Pourtalès’ statement (_Amer. Naturalist_, ii.\r\n434), though it has got credence in many of the leading books on this\r\nsubject. Col. Whittlesey has reported some not very ancient hearths in\r\nthe Ohio Valley (_Am. Ass. Arts and Sciences, Proc., Chicago, 1868,\r\nMeeting_, vol. xvii. 268).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe testimony of the caves to the early existence of man has never had\r\nthe importance in America that it has had in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1822 that Dr. Buckland, in his _Reliquiae diluvianae_ (2d\r\ned., 1824), first made something like a systematic gathering of the\r\nevidence of animal remains, as shown by cave explorations; but he was\r\nnot prepared to believe that man’s remains were as old as the beasts.\r\nHe later came to believe in the prehistoric man. In 1833-34, Dr.\r\nSchmerling found in the cave of Enghis, near Liége, a highly developed\r\nskull, and published his _Recherches sur les ossemens fossiles\r\ndécouverts dans les cavernes de la province de Liége_.[1671]\r\n\r\nIn 1841, Boucher de Perthes began his discoveries in the valley of\r\nthe Somme,[1672] and finally discovered among the animal remains some\r\nflint implements, and formulated his views of the great antiquity of\r\nman in his _Antiquités Celtiques_ (1847), rather for the derision than\r\nfor the delectation of his brother geologists. In 1848, the Société\r\nEthnographique de Paris ceased its sessions; but Boucher de Perthes had\r\naroused a new feeling, and while his efforts were still in doubt his\r\ndisciples[1673] gathered, and amid much ridicule founded the Société\r\nd’Anthropologie de Paris, which has had so numerous a following in\r\nallied associations in Europe and America.\r\n\r\nHe tells us of the struggles he endured to secure the recognition of\r\nhis views in his _De l’homme antédiluvien et de ses œuvres_ (Paris,\r\n1860), and his trials were not over when, in 1863, he found at Moulin\r\nQuignon a human jaw-bone,[1674] which, as he felt, added much strength\r\nto the belief in the man of the glacial gravels.[1675]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe existence of man in the somewhat later period of the caves[1676]\r\nwas also claiming constant recognition, and the new society was\r\nbroad enough to cover all. In 1857, Dr. Fuhlrott had discovered the\r\nNeanderthal skull in a cave near Düsseldorf.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, the discovery of flint tools in the Brixham cave, in\r\nDevonshire, was more effective in turning the scientific mind to the\r\nproofs than earlier discoveries of much the same character by McEnery\r\nhad been. In March, 1872, Emile Rivière investigated the Mentone caves,\r\nand found a large skeleton, unmistakably human, and the oldest yet\r\nfound, supposed to be of the palæolithic period. (Cf. _Découverte d’un\r\nSquelette humain de l’Epoque paléolithique_, Paris, 1873.) All this\r\nevidence is best set forth in the collection of his periodical studies\r\non the mammals of the Pleistocene, which were collected by William Boyd\r\nDawkins in his _Cave Hunting: researches on the evidence of caves,\r\nrespecting the early inhabitants of Europe_ (London, 1874),[1677] a\r\nbook which may be considered a sort of complement to Lyell’s _Antiquity\r\nof Man_ and Lubbock’s _Prehistoric Man_; Dawkins (ch. 9, and _Address_,\r\nSalford, 1877, p. 3) and Lubbock (_Scientific Lectures_, 150) unite\r\nin holding the modern Eskimos to be the representative of this cave\r\nfolk. No argument is quite sufficient to convince Southall that the\r\narchæologists do not place the denizens of the caves too far back\r\n(_Recent Origin of Man_, ch. 13), and he rejects a belief in the steady\r\nslowness of the formation of stalagmites (_Epoch of the Mammoth_, 90),\r\nupon which Evans, Geikie, Wallace, Lyell, and others rest much of their\r\nbelief in the great antiquity of the remains found beneath the cave\r\ndeposits.[1678]\r\n\r\nThe largest development of cave testimony in America has been made\r\nby Dr. Lund,[1679] a Danish naturalist, who examined several hundred\r\nBrazilian caves, finding in them the bones of man in connection with\r\nthose of extinct animals.[1680] The remains of a race, held to be\r\nIndians, found in the caves of Coahuila (Mexico) are described by\r\nCordelia A. Studley in the _Peabody Mus. Reports_, xv. 233. Edward D.\r\nCope has studied the contents of a bone cave in the island of Anguilla\r\n(West Indies), in the _Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge_, no.\r\n489 (1883). J. D. Whitney describes a cave in Calaveras County, in the\r\n_Smithsonian Rept._ (1887), and Edward Palmer one in Utah (_Peab. Mus.\r\nRept._, xi. 269). Putnam explored some in Kentucky (_Ibid._ viii.).\r\nPutnam’s first account of his cave work in Kentucky, showing the use\r\nof them as habitations and as receptacles for mummies, is in the\r\n_Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. Hist._, xvii. 319. J. P. Goodnow made similar\r\nexplorations in Arizona (_Kansas City Rev_., viii. 647); E. T. Elliott\r\nin Colorado (_Pop. Sci. Mo._, Oct., 1879), and Leidy in the Hartman\r\ncave, in Pennsylvania (_Philad. Acad. Nat. Sci. Proc._, 1880, p. 348).\r\nCf. also Haldeman in the _Am. Philos. Soc. Trans._ (1880) xv. 351. Col.\r\nCharles Whittlesey has discussed the “Evidences of the antiquity of\r\nman in the United States,” in describing some cave remains of doubtful\r\nage.[1681] W. H. Dall’s _On the remains of later prehistoric man\r\nobtained from caves in the Catherine archipelago, Alaska territory, and\r\nespecially from the caves of the Aleutian islands_ (Washington, 1878)\r\nis included in the _Smithsonian contributions to knowledge_, xxii.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThroughout the world, naturalists have found on streams and on the\r\nseacoast, heaps of the refuse of the daily life of primitive peoples.\r\nBeneath the loam which has covered them there are found the shells of\r\nedible mollusks and other relics of food, implements, ornaments and\r\nvessels, of stone, clay, and bone. Sometimes it happens that natural\r\nsuperposed accumulations will mark them off in layers, and distinguish\r\nthe usages of successive periods.[1682]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSCAR PESCHEL.\r\n\r\nFrom the engraving in the 1877 ed. of his _Gesch. des Zeitalters der\r\nEntdeckungen_. His _Abhandlungen zur Erd-und Völker-Kunde_, continuing\r\nhis contributions to _Das Ausland_ and other periodicals, and edited\r\nby J. Löwenberg, was published at Leipzig, in 3 vols. in 1877-79, the\r\npreface containing an account of Peschel’s services in this field.]\r\n\r\nIn the Old World such heaps upon the Danish coast have attracted the\r\nmost attention under the name of Kjœkkenmœddinger, or Kitchen-middens,\r\nand their teachings have enlivened the recitals of nearly all the\r\nEuropean archæologists who have sought to picture the condition of\r\nthese early races.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the general opinion that in the Old World this\r\nshell-heap folk succeeded, if they do not in part constitute the\r\ncontemporaries of, the men of the caves.[1683]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEFFRIES WYMAN.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken in 1868, furnished by his family. The portrait\r\nin the _Peabody Museum Report_, no. viii., represents him somewhat\r\nlater in life, with a beard. He died Sept. 4, 1874. There are accounts\r\nof Wyman in the same _Report_, by Asa Gray, who also made an address\r\non Wyman before the Boston Society of Nat. Hist. (cf. _Pop. Science\r\nMonthly_, Jan., 1875), with commemorations by O. W. Holmes (_Atlantic\r\nMonthly_, Nov., 1874, and _Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc._, xiv. 4), by F. W.\r\nPutnam in the _Proc. Amer. Acad._ with a list of his publications; by\r\nPackard in the _Mem. Nat. Acad._, and B. G. Wilder (_Old and New_,\r\nNov., 1874).]\r\n\r\nThese accumulations are known usually in America as shell heaps, and\r\nit is generally characteristic of them that, while they contain pottery\r\nand bone implements, the stone instruments are far less numerous,\r\nand generally occur in the upper layers in those of Florida, but\r\nthey are scattered through all the layers in those of New England.\r\nProfessor Jeffries Wyman, whose name is in this country particularly\r\nassociated with shell-heap investigations, could not find[1684] that\r\nany one had in the scientific spirit called attention to the subject\r\nin America earlier than Caleb Atwater in the _Archæologia Americana_\r\n(vol. i., 1820), who had observed such deposits on the Muskingum River\r\nin Ohio. They had not passed unnoticed, however, by some of the early\r\nexplorers. Putnam (_Essex Inst. Bulletin_, xv. 86) notes that J. T.\r\nDucatel observed those on the Chesapeake in 1834. The earliest more\r\nparticular mention of the inland mounds seem to have been made in\r\nPrinz Maximilian’s _Travels in the United States_.[1685] Foster, in\r\nhis _Prehistoric Races of the U. S._ (ch. 4,—a special survey of the\r\nAmerican heaps), says that Professor Vanuxem was the first to describe\r\nthe sea-side mounds in 1841, in the _Proc. Amer. Asso. Geologists_ (i.\r\n22).[1686]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHELL HEAPS ON CAPE COD.]\r\n\r\nThere has been as yet little found in America from which to develop\r\nthe evidence of early man from any lake or river dwellings, while\r\nso much has been done in Europe.[1687] In some parts of Florida the\r\nIndians are reported to have built houses on piles; and in South\r\nAmerica tree-houses and those on platforms are well known. Mr. Hilborne\r\nT. Cresson has reported (_Peabody Mus. Rept_., xxii. for 1888) the\r\ndiscovery of pile ends in the Delaware River, and has shown that two of\r\nthese river stations are earlier than the third, as is evident from the\r\nrude implements of argillite found in the two when compared with those\r\ndiscovered in the third, where implements of jasper and quartz and\r\nfragments of pottery were associated with those of argillite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUEBLO REGION.\r\n\r\nFrom a map, “Originalkarte der Urwohnsitze der Azteken und Verwandten\r\nPueblos in New Mexico, zusammengestellt von O. Loew,” in Petermann’s\r\n_Mittheilungen über wichtige neue Erforschungen auf dem Gesammtgebiete\r\nder Geographie_, xxii. (1876), table xii. The small dotted circles\r\nstand for inhabited pueblos; those with a perpendicular line\r\nattached are ruins; and when this perpendicular line is crossed it\r\nis a Mexicanized pueblo. See the map in Powell’s _Second Rept. Bur.\r\nEthnol._ (1880-81) p. 318, which marks the several classes: inhabited,\r\nabandoned, ruined pueblos, cavate houses, cliff houses, and tower\r\nhouses.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest discoveries of the cliff houses of the Colorado region\r\nwere made by Lieut. J. H. Simpson, and his descriptions appeared in his\r\n_Journal of a Military Reconnoissance_, in 1849.[1688] No considerable\r\naddition was made to our knowledge of the cliff dwellers till in\r\n1874-75, when special parties of the Hayden Geological Survey were\r\nsent to explore them (_Hayden’s Report_, 1876), whence we got accounts\r\nof those of southwestern Colorado by W. H. Holmes, including the\r\ncavate-houses and cliff-dwellers of the San Juan, the Mancos, and the\r\nruins in the McElmo cañon.[1689] W. H. Jackson gives a revised account\r\nof his 1874 expedition in the _Bulletin_ of the Survey (vol. ii. no.\r\n1), adding thereto an account of his explorations of 1875. Jackson also\r\ngives a chapter on the ruins of the Chaco cañon.[1690]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn coming to the class of ruins lying in a few instances just within,\r\nbut mostly to the north of, the Mexican line, we encounter the Pueblo\r\nrace, whose position in the ethnological chart is not quite certain,\r\nbe their connection with the Nahuas and Aztecs,[1691] or with the\r\nmoundbuilders,—red Indian if they be,—or with the cliff-dwellers, as\r\nperhaps is the better opinion. Their connection with savage nations\r\nfarther north is not wholly determinable, as Morgan allows, on physical\r\nand social grounds, and perhaps not as definitely settled by their\r\narchitecture as Cushing seems to think.[1692]\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard early encountered these ruins,[1693] and perhaps the\r\nbest summary of the growth of our knowledge of them by successive\r\nexplorations is in Bancroft’s _Nat. Races_, iv. ch. 11.[1694] In the\r\ncentury after the Spanish conquest, we have one of the best accounts\r\nin the _Memorial_ of Fray Alonso Benavides, published at Madrid in\r\n1630.[1695] The most famous of the ruins of this region, the Casa\r\nGrande of the Gila Valley in Arizona,[1696] is supposed to have been\r\nseen (1540) by Coronado, then in a state of ruin; but we get no clear\r\ndescription till that given by Padre Mange, who accompanied Padre Kino\r\nto see the ruins in 1697.[1697]\r\n\r\nThere are few descriptions[1698] of the antiquities of this country\r\nprevious to the military examination of it which was made during the\r\nMexican War. Such is recorded in W. H. Emory’s _Notes of a Military\r\nReconnoissance from Fort Leavenworth in Missouri to San Diego in\r\nCalifornia_,[1699] which gives us some of the earliest representations\r\nof these antiquities, including the ruins of Pecos.[1700] In 1849,\r\nCol. Washington, the governor of New Mexico, organized an expedition\r\nagainst the Navajos, and Lieut. James H. Simpson gives us the first\r\ndetailed account of the Chaco cañon in his _Journal of a Military\r\nReconnoissance_ (Philad., 1852).[1701] He also covered (p. 90), among\r\nthe other ruins of this region, the old and present habitations of the\r\nZuñi, but these received in some respects more detailed examination\r\nin Capt. L. Sitgreave’s _Report of an Expedition down the Zuñi and\r\nColorado rivers_ (Washington, 1853),[1702] accompanied by a map and\r\nother illustrations.[1703] New channels of information were opened\r\nwhen the United States government undertook to make surveys (1853) for\r\na trans-continental line of railways; and a great deal of material is\r\nembodied in Whipple’s report on the Indian tribes in the _Pacific R. R.\r\nReports_, vol. iii. The running of the boundary line between the United\r\nStates and Mexico also contributed to our knowledge. The commissioner\r\nduring 1850-53 was John Russell Bartlett, who, on the failure of the\r\ngovernment promptly to publish his report, printed his _Personal\r\nnarrative of explorations and incidents_ (N. Y., 1854), and made in\r\nsome parts of it an important contribution to our knowledge of the\r\nantiquities of this region.[1704]\r\n\r\nNo considerable advance was now made in this study for about a score\r\nof years. Major Powell first published his account of his adventurous\r\nexploration (1869) of the Colorado cañon in _Scribner’s Monthly_ (Jan.,\r\nFeb., Mar.) in 1875, and it was followed by his official _Exploration\r\nof the Colorado River_ (Washington, 1875), making known the existence\r\nof ruins in the cañon’s gloomy depths. The _Reports_ of the U. S.\r\nGeological Survey, including the accounts by W. H. Jackson and W. H.\r\nHolmes, give much valuable and original information; and a good deal of\r\nwhat has been included in the _Reports of the Chief of Engineers_ (U.\r\nS. Army) for 1875 and 1876 will also be found in the seventh volume,\r\nedited by F. W. Putnam, of _Wheeler’s Survey_,[1705] including the\r\npueblos of Acoma, Taos, San Juan, and the ruin[1706] on the Animas\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nThe latest examinations of these Pueblo remains, of which we have\r\npublished accounts, are those made by A. F. Bandelier for the\r\nArchæological Institute of America. He has given his results in his\r\n“Historical introduction to studies among the sedentary Indians of New\r\nMexico,” and in his “Report on the ruins of Pecos,” which constitutes\r\nthe initial volume of _Papers, American series_, of the Institute\r\n(Boston, 1881).[1707] He believes Pecos to be Cicuye, visited by\r\nAlvarado in 1541,—a huge pile with 585 compartments, finally abandoned\r\nin 1840. In October, 1880, he examined the region west of Santa Fé\r\n(_Second Rept. Archæol. Inst._). His explorations also determined\r\nthe eastern limits of the sedentary occupation of New Mexico (_Fifth\r\nReport_). He renewed his studies in 1882 (_First Bull. Archæol. Inst._,\r\nJan., 1883), and thought the ruins showed successive occupiers, and\r\ndivides them into cave dwellings, cliff houses, one-story buildings,\r\nand those of more than one, with each higher one retreating from the\r\nfront of the next lower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PUEBLO REGION.\r\n\r\nA reduction of the map accompanying Bandelier’s report on his\r\ninvestigations in New Mexico, in the _Fifth Rept. of the Archæological\r\nInstitute of America_ (Cambridge, 1884).]\r\n\r\nThe most essential sources of information have thus been enumerated,\r\nbut there is not a little fugitive and comprehensive treatment of\r\nthe subject worth the student’s attention who follows a course of\r\ninvestigation.[1708]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe literature of the moundbuilders, and of the controversies arising\r\nout of the mysterious relics of their life, is commensurate with the\r\nvery wide extent of territory covered by their traces.[1709] It was\r\nlong before any intelligent notice was taken of the mounds by those who\r\ntraversed the wilderness. De Soto, in 1540, could get no traditions\r\nconcerning them beyond the assurances that the peoples he encountered\r\nhad built them, or some of them. We read of them also in Garcilasso\r\nde la Vega, Biedma and the Knight of Elvas, on the Spanish side; but\r\non the French at a later day we learn little or nothing from Joutel,\r\nTonti, and Hennepin, though something from Du Pratz, La Harpe and some\r\nof the missionaries. Kalm,[1710] the Swede, in 1749, was about the\r\nfirst to make any note of them. Carver found them near Lake Pepin in\r\n1768. In 1772 the missionary David Jones[1711] made observations upon\r\nthose in Ohio. Adair did not wholly overlook them in his _American\r\nIndians_ in 1775. Prof. James Dunbar, of Aberdeen, in his _Essays on\r\nthe history of mankind in rude and uncultivated ages_ (Lond., 1780),\r\nuses what little Kalm and Carver afforded. Jefferson in his _Notes on\r\nVirginia_ (1782) speaks of them as barrows “all over the country,” and\r\n“obvious repositories of the dead.”[1712] Arthur Lee makes reference\r\nto them in 1784. A map of the Northwest Territory, published by John\r\nFitch about 1785, places in the territory which is now Wisconsin the\r\nfollowing legend: “This country has once been settled by a people\r\nmore expert in the art of war than the present inhabitants. Regular\r\nfortifications, and some of these incredibly large, are frequently\r\nto be found. Also many graves and towers like pyramids of earth.” In\r\n1786 Franklin thought the works at Marietta might have been built\r\nby De Soto; and Noah Webster, in a paper in Roberts’ _Florida_,\r\nassented.[1713] B. S. Barton, in his _Observations in some parts of\r\nNatural History_ (London, 1787), credited the Toltecs with building\r\nthem, whom he considered the descendants of the Danes.\r\n\r\nAs the century draws to a close, we find occasional and rather\r\nbewildered expression of interest in the _Observations on the Ancient\r\nMounds_ by Major Jonathan Heart;[1714] in the _Missions_ of Loskiel;\r\nin the _New Views_ of Dr. Smith Barton; in the _Carolina_ of William\r\nBartram; and in the travels of Volney. In 1794 Winthrop Sargent\r\nreported in the _Amer. Philos. Soc. Trans._, iv., on the exploration of\r\nthe mounds at Cincinnati. The present century soon elicited a variety\r\nof observations, but there was little of practical exploration. A New\r\nEngland minister, Thaddeus Mason Harris, passed judgment upon those in\r\nOhio, when he journeyed thither in 1803.[1715] The commissioner of the\r\nUnited States to run the Florida boundary, Andrew Ellicott, describes\r\nsome near Natchez in his _Journal_ (1803). Bishop Madison communicated\r\nthrough Professor Barton some opinions about those in Western Virginia,\r\nwhich appear in the _Transaction_ of the American Philosophical\r\nSociety, taking different grounds from Dr. Harris, who had thought them\r\nworks of defence. The explorations of Lewis and Clark (1804-6) up the\r\nMissouri, and of Pike (1805-7) up the Mississippi, produced little.\r\nRobin, the French naturalist, in 1805,[1716] Major Stoddard[1717]\r\nand Breckenridge[1718] later, saw some in Louisiana, Missouri, and\r\nIllinois. A leading periodical, _The Portfolio_, contributed something\r\nto the common stock in 1810 and 1814, giving plans of some of the\r\nmounds. Those in Ohio were again the subject of inquiry by F. Cuming in\r\nhis _Sketches of a Tour to the Western Country_ (Pittsburg, 1810), and\r\nby Dr. Daniel Drake in his _Picture of Cincinnati and the Miami Valley_\r\n(Cinn., 1815). John Heckewelder, the Moravian missionary, accounted for\r\nthe ancient fortifications through the traditions of the Delawares,\r\nwho professed once to have inhabited this country, but it has been\r\nsuspected that the worthy missionary was imposed upon.[1719] DeWitt\r\nClinton, in 1811, before the New York Historical Society, and again in\r\n1817, before the Literary and Philosophical Society of New York, had\r\ngiven some theories in which the Scandinavians figured as builders of\r\nthe mounds in that State.\r\n\r\nIt was thus at a time when there was much speculation and not much\r\nreal experimental knowledge respecting these remains that, under the\r\nauspices of the then newly founded American Antiquarian Society,\r\nMr. Caleb Atwater, of Ohio, was employed to explore and survey a\r\nconsiderable number of these works. He embodied his results in the\r\ninitial volume of the publication of that society, the _Archæologia\r\nAmericana_.[1720] After pointing out scattered evidences of the traces\r\nof European peoples, found in coins and other relics throughout the\r\ncountry, Atwater proceeds to his description of the earthworks, mainly\r\nof Ohio; and beside giving many plans,[1721] he enters into the\r\nquestion of their origin, and expresses a belief in the Asiatic origin\r\nof their builders, and in their subsequent migration south to lay, as\r\nhe thinks, the foundations of the Mexican and Peruvian civilizations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COL. CHARLES WHITTLESEY.\r\n\r\nAfter a photograph kindly furnished by the Hon. C. C. Baldwin, of\r\nCleveland, Ohio, who has printed a memorial of his friend with a list\r\nof his writings in _Tract 68 of the Western Reserve Hist. Soc._]\r\n\r\nDuring the next twenty-five years there cannot be said to have been\r\nmuch added to a real knowledge of the subject. Yates and Moulton in\r\ntheir _Hist. New York_ (1824) borrowed mainly from Kirkland (1788)\r\nthe missionary. Humboldt had no personal contact with the remains to\r\ngive his views any value (1825). Warden in his _Recherches_ (1827)\r\ngave some new plans and rearranged the old descriptions. There was\r\nsome sober observation in M’Culloh’s _Researches_ (3d ed., 1829); some\r\nfar from sober in Rafinesque (1838); some compiled descriptions with\r\nworthless comment in Josiah Priest’s _American Antiquities_ (Albany,\r\n1838); something like scientific deductions in S. G. Morton’s study of\r\nthe few moundbuilders’ skulls then known, in his _Cranea Americana_\r\n(1839); with an attempt at summing up in Delafield (1839) and Bradford\r\n(1841). This is about all that had been added to what Atwater did, when\r\nE. G. Squier and E. H. Davis eclipsed all labors preceding theirs, and\r\nbegan the series of the _Smithsonian Contributions_ with their _Ancient\r\nMonuments of the Mississippi Valley_ (Washington, 1847 and 1848).[1722]\r\nDuring the preceding two years they had opened over two hundred mounds,\r\nand explored about a hundred earthwork enclosures, and had gathered a\r\nconsiderable collection of specimens of moundbuilders’ relics.[1723]\r\nThey had begun their work under the auspices of the American\r\nEthnological Society, but the cost of the production of the volume\r\nexceeded the society’s resources, and the transfer was made to the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. The work took a commanding position at once,\r\nand still remains of essential value, though some of the grounds of its\r\nauthors are not acceptable to present observers; and indeed in his work\r\non the mounds of New York, which the Smithsonian Institution included\r\nin the second volume of their _Contributions_, Squier found occasion to\r\nalter some of his opinions in his earlier work, or at least to ascribe\r\nthe mounds of that State to the Iroquois. The third volume of the same\r\n_Contributions_ (1852) introduces to us one of the ablest of the local\r\ninvestigators in a paper by Charles Whittlesey, of “Descriptions of\r\nAncient Works in Ohio,”—the forerunner of numerous papers which he has\r\ngiven to the public in elucidation of the mounds.[1724] Three years\r\nlater (1855), in the seventh volume of the _Smithsonian Contributions_,\r\na new field in the emblematic and animal mounds of the northwest\r\nwas for the first time brought to any considerable extent to public\r\nattention in the paper by Increase A. Lapham, on the “Antiquities of\r\nWisconsin.” Lapham had made his explorations under the auspices of the\r\nAmerican Antiquarian Society,[1725] and his manuscript had been revised\r\nby Haven, when it was decided to consign it for publication to the\r\nSmithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INCREASE A. LAPHAM.\r\n\r\nEngraved from a photograph dated 1863, kindly furnished by his friend,\r\nProf. J. D. Whitney. Lapham died in 1875. Cf. _Amer. Journal of\r\nScience_, x. 320; xi. 326, 333; _Trans. Wisc. Acad. Science_, iii. 264.]\r\n\r\nThe animal mounds had been indeed earlier mentioned, and the great\r\nserpent mound of Ohio had long attracted attention; but it was in the\r\nterritory now known as Wisconsin that these mounds were found chiefly\r\nto abound. Long, in 1823, speaks of mounds in this region; but the\r\nforest coverings seem to have prevented any observer detecting their\r\nshapes till Lapham first noted this peculiarity in 1836. In April,\r\n1838, R. C. Taylor was the earliest to figure them in the _Amer.\r\nJournal of Science_ (Silliman’s), and again they were described by S.\r\nTaylor in _Ibid._, 1842. Prof. John Locke referred to them in a _Report\r\non the mineral lands of the United States_, made to Congress in 1844.\r\nWilliam Pidgeon, who had been a trader among the Indians, published in\r\nhis _Traditions of De-coo-dah, and Antiquarian researches: comprising\r\nextensive exploration, surveys and excavations of the Mound Builders in\r\nAmerica; the traditions of the last Prophet of the Elk Nation, relative\r\nto their origin and use, and the evidences of an ancient population\r\nmore numerous than the present Aborigines_ (N. Y., 1853; again 1858)\r\nwhat he pretended was in large part the results of his intercourse\r\nwith an Indian chief, involving some theories as to the symbolism of\r\nthe mounds. The book contained so many palpable perversions, not to\r\nsay undisguised fictions, that the Smithsonian Institution refused to\r\npublish it;[1726] and the book has never gained any credit, though some\r\nunguarded writers have unwittingly borrowed from it.[1727]\r\n\r\nIn the eighth volume of the _Smithsonian Contributions_,[1728] Haven,\r\nthe librarian of the Amer. Antiq. Soc., summed up the results of mound\r\nexploration as they then stood. The steady and circumspect habit of\r\nHaven’s mind was conspicuous in his treatment of the mounds. It is\r\nto him that the later advocates of the identity of their builders\r\nwith the race of the red Indians look as the first sensibly to affect\r\npublic opinion in the matter.[1729] He argued against their being a\r\nmore advanced race (p. 154), and in his _Report_ of the Am. Antiq.\r\nSoc., in 1877 (p. 37), he held that it might yet be proved that the\r\nmoundbuilders and red Indians were one in race, as M’Culloh had already\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Haven was first intimating (1856) that this view\r\nmight yet become accepted, it was doubtless held to be best established\r\nthat those who built the mounds were quite another race from those\r\nwho lived among them when Europeans first knew the country. The fact\r\nthat the Indians had no tradition of their origin was held to be\r\nalmost conclusive, though it is alleged that the southern Indians in\r\nlater times retained no recollections of the expedition of De Soto,\r\nand Dr. Brinton thinks that it is common for Indian traditions to die\r\nout.[1730] It is not till recent years that any considerable number of\r\nmoundbuilder skulls have been known, and from the scant data which the\r\nearly craniologists had, their opinion seems to have coincided with\r\nthose in favor of a vanished race.[1731] It was a favorite theory, not\r\nyet wholly departed, that they were in some way connected with the more\r\nsouthern peoples, the Pueblo Indians, the Aztecs, or the Peruvians;\r\neither that they came from them, or migrated south and became one with\r\nthem.[1732] The bolder theory, that we see their descendants in the red\r\nIndians, is perhaps gaining ground, and it has had the support of the\r\nBureau of Ethnology and some able expounders.[1733]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT SERPENT MOUND.\r\n\r\nThis follows a survey given in Squier’s _Serpent Symbol_ (N.

Putnam has\r\nrecently purchased over sixty acres about the effigy, which is to\r\nbe held by the trustees of the Peabody Museum as a park (_Repts._,\r\nxxi. 14); and his recent explorations show that the projections in\r\nthe side of the head (shaded dark in the cut) are not a part of the\r\nconstruction. He also finds two distinct periods of occupation in this\r\nregion, to the oldest of which he attributes this work (_Peab. Mus.\r\nRept._ 1888). W. H. Holmes made a survey in 1886 (_Amer. Antiquarian_,\r\nMay, 1887, ix. 141; _Science_, viii. 624, Dec. 31, 1886). Cf. J. P.\r\nMacLean, in _Amer. Antiquarian_, vii. 44, and his _Moundbuilders_, p.\r\n56; Baldwin’s _Anc. America_, 29. T. H. Lewis describes a snake mound\r\nin Minnesota (_Science_, ix. 393). On the serpent symbol see S. D.\r\nPeet, in _Amer. Antiquarian_, viii. 197; ix. 13, where he manifests a\r\nsomewhat omnivorous appetite.]\r\n\r\nOf the opposing theory of a disappeared race, Capt. Heart in reply to\r\nBarton (_Amer. Philolog. Asso. Proc._ iii.) gave, as Thomas thinks,\r\n“the earliest clear and distinct expression,” but Squier and Davis may\r\nbe considered as first giving it definite meaning; and though Squier\r\ndoes not seem to have actually revoked this judgment as respects the\r\nmounds in the Mississippi valley, he finally reached the conclusion\r\nthat those in New York were really the work of the Iroquois.[1734]\r\nThis ancient-race theory, sometimes amounting to a belief in their\r\nautochthonous origin, has impressed the public through some of the\r\nbest known summaries of American antiquities, like those of Baldwin,\r\nWilson, and Short,[1735] and has been adopted by men of such reputation\r\nas Lyell.[1736] The position taken by Professor F. W. Putnam, the\r\ncurator of the Peabody Museum of Archæology at Cambridge, is much like\r\nthat taken earlier by Warden in his _Recherches_, that both views\r\nare, within their own limitations, correct, and, as Putnam expresses\r\nit, “that many Indian tribes built mounds and earthworks is beyond\r\ndoubt; but that all the mounds and earthworks of North America are\r\nby these same tribes, or their immediate ancestors, is not thereby\r\nproved.”[1737] Thomas (_Fifth Report, Bureau Ethnol._) holds this\r\nstatement to be too vague. It is certainly shown in the whole history\r\nof archæological study that uncompromising demarcations have sooner or\r\nlater to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nMorgan finds it difficult to dissociate the mounds with his favorite\r\ntheory of communal life.[1738] There is no readier way of marking the\r\ndevelopment of opinion on this question than to follow the series\r\nof the _Annual Reports_ of the Smithsonian Institution, as hardly\r\na year has passed since 1861 but these _Reports_ have had in them\r\ncontributions on the subject.[1739] Among periodicals, the more\r\nconstant attention to the mounds is conspicuous in the _American\r\nAntiquarian_.[1740]\r\n\r\nThe basis for estimating the age of the mounds is threefold. In the\r\nfirst place, there are very few found on the last of the river terraces\r\nto be reclaimed from the stream. In the second place, the decay of the\r\nskeletons found in them can be taken as of some indication, if due\r\nregard be had to the kind of earth in which they are buried. Third,\r\nthe age of trees upon them has been accepted as carrying them back a\r\ncertain period, at least, though this may widely vary, if you assume\r\ntheir growth to be subsequent to the abandonment of the mounds, or\r\nif, as Brinton holds,[1741] the trees were planted immediately upon\r\nthe building. The dependence upon counting the rings is by no means a\r\nsettled opinion as to all climes; but in the temperate zone the best\r\nauthorities place dependence upon it. Unfortunately it cannot carry us\r\nback much over 600 years.[1742]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe early attempts to disclose the ethnological relations of the\r\nmoundbuilders on cranial evidence were embarrassed by the fewness\r\nof the skulls then known. Morton (_Crania Americana_) called the\r\nfour examined by him identical with those of the red Indian.[1743]\r\nAt present, considerable numbers are available; but still Wilson\r\n(_Prehistoric Man_, ii. 128) holds that “we lack sufficient data,” and\r\nin the consideration of them sufficient care has not always been taken\r\nto distinguish intrusive burials of a later date.[1744]\r\n\r\nJ. W. Foster (_Prehist. Races_, ch. 8; _Amer. Assoc. Adv. Sci.\r\nTrans._, 1872; and _Amer. Naturalist_, vi. 738) held to a lower type\r\nof skull, on this evidence, than Wilson (_Prehist. Man_, ii. ch. 20)\r\ncontended for. There are examples of the wide difference of views\r\n(MacLean, 142), when some, like Morgan, connect them with the Pueblo\r\nskulls (_No. Amer. Rev._, cix., Oct., 1869), and others, like Morton,\r\nWinchell, Wilson, Brasseur, and Foster, find their correspondences\r\nin those of Mexico and Peru.[1745] Putnam, whose experience with\r\nmound skulls is greatest of all, holds to the southern short head\r\nand the northern long head (_Rept._ 1888). Probably we have no\r\nbetter enumeration of the variety of objects and relics found in the\r\nmounds, though much has since been added to the collection, than in\r\nRau’s _Catalogue of the Archæological Collection of the National\r\nMuseum_ (Washington, 1876).[1746] Unfortunately he shows little or\r\nno discrimination between discoveries in the mounds and those of\r\nthe surface. The interest in such collections has naturally brought\r\nprominently to the attention of every student of such collections\r\nthe tricks of fraudulent imitators, and there are several well-known\r\ninstances of protracted controversies on the genuineness of certain\r\nrelics.[1747]\r\n\r\nThere remains in this survey of the literature of the mounds in\r\nall their varieties, to go over it, finally, in relation to their\r\ngeographical distribution:[1748]—\r\n\r\nNew England is almost destitute of these antiquities. The one that has\r\nattracted some attention is what is described as a fortification in\r\nSanbornton, in New Hampshire, which when found was faced with stone\r\nexternally, and the walls were six feet thick and breast-high, when\r\ndescribed about one hundred and fifteen years ago. There is a plan\r\nof it, with a descriptive account, preserved in the library of the\r\nAmerican Antiq. Society,[1749] and another plan and description in M.\r\nT. Runnels’s _Hist. of Sanbornton_ (Boston, 1882), i. ch. 4. Squier\r\nalso figured it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CINCINNATI TABLET.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_, i. 274, engraved from a\r\nrubbing taken from the original. Wilson adds: “Mr. Whittlesey has\r\nincluded this tablet among his Archæological Frauds; but the result\r\nof inquiries made by me has removed from my mind any doubt of its\r\ngenuineness.” Cf. other cuts in M. C. Read, _Archæol. of Ohio_ (1888);\r\nSquier and Davis, fig. 195; Short, p. 45; MacLean, 107; and _Second\r\nRept. Bur. of Ethnol._, pp. 133-34.]\r\n\r\nAs we move westward, the mounds begin to be numerous in the State\r\nof New York, and particularly in the western part of it. One of the\r\nearliest descriptions of them, after that of the missionary Kirkland\r\n(about 1788), is in the “Journal of the Rev. John Taylor while on\r\na mission through the Mohawk and Black River Country in 1802,”\r\nwhich was first printed, with plans of the works examined, in the\r\n_Documentary Hist. New York_ (vol. iii. quarto ed.). In 1818 DeWitt\r\nClinton published at Albany his _Memoir on the Antiquities of the\r\nwestern part of New York_, in which he attributes their origin to\r\nthe Scandinavians.[1750] They were again described in David Thomas’s\r\n_Travels through the western country in 1816_ (Auburn, 1819). There is\r\nnot much else to note for twenty-five years. In 1845, Schoolcraft made\r\nto the N. Y. Senate his _Report on the Census of the Iroquois Indians_\r\n(Albany and N. Y., 1846, 1847, 1848), which is better known, perhaps,\r\nin the trade edition, _Notes on the Iroquois; or Contributions to the\r\nStatistics, Aboriginal History, Antiquities and General Ethnology\r\nof Western New York_ (N. Y. 1846). In 1850, the _Third Report_ of\r\nthe Regents of the University of the State of N. Y. contains F. B.\r\nHough’s paper on the earthwork enclosures in the State, with cuts.\r\nThe same year (1850) came the essential authority on the New York\r\nmounds, E. G. Squier’s _Aboriginal Monuments of the State of N. Y.,\r\ncomprising the results of original surveys and explorations, with an\r\nillustrative appendix_ (Washington, 1850), which the next year made\r\npart of the second volume of the _Smithsonian Contributions_.[1751] He\r\nenumerates in New York about 250 defensive structures, beside burial\r\nmounds and in his appendix describes those in New Hampshire and some in\r\nPennsylvania.[1752] Some new explorations of the New York mounds were\r\nmade in 1859 by T. Apoleon Cheney, who describes them, giving plans and\r\ncuts, in the _Thirteenth Report_ of the Regents of the University.[1753]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT WORKS ON THE MUSKINGUM.\r\n\r\nReduced from an early engraving in T. M. Harris’s _Journal of a Tour\r\ninto the territory northwest of the Alleghany, 1803_ (Boston, 1805).\r\nHarris’s plan in relation to the new town of Marietta is given in Vol.\r\nVII. p. 540. To follow down the plans chronologically, we find that of\r\nWinthrop Sargent, communicated to the Amer. Academy in 1787, reproduced\r\nin their _Memoirs_, new ser. v. part i. The _Columbian Mag._, May,\r\n1787, vol. i. 425, and the _N. Y. Mag._ (1791) had plans. One was in\r\nSchultz’s _Travels_ (1807), 146. Atwater, of course, gave one in 1820.\r\nA survey by S. Dewitt, 1822, is in Josiah Priest’s _Amer. Antiquities_,\r\n3d ed., Albany, 1833. Others are in the _Amer. Pioneer_, Oct., 1842,\r\nJune 1843, and in S. P. Hildreth’s _Pioneer History_, 212 (Jan., 1843).\r\nWhittlesey made the survey in Squier and Davis (who also give a colored\r\nview), and it is reduced in Foster. Cf. also _Amer. Antiquarian_, Jan.,\r\n1880; _Mag. Amer. Hist._, 1885, p. 547; Henry A. Shepard’s _Antiquities\r\nof Ohio_ (Cinn., 1887); Nadaillac’s _L’Amérique préhistorique_, 105,\r\nand _Les prem. Hommes_, ii. 33.]\r\n\r\nIt was, however, in Ohio that the interest in these mounds was first\r\nincited, and that the more thorough exploration has been made.[1754]\r\nThe earliest pioneers reported upon them. Cutler described them in\r\n1789 in a letter to Jeremy Belknap.[1755] Benj. S. Barton described a\r\nmound at Cincinnati in 1799.[1756] Dr. Harris in 1805 was seemingly\r\nthe earliest traveller to note them in _Journal of a Tour_, where he\r\ngives one of the earliest engravings. A plan of those at Circleville,\r\nwith description by J. Kilbourne, is given in the _Ohio Gazetteer_\r\n(Columbus, 1817). Caleb Atwater, in 1820, was more familiar with them\r\nthan with others of his broader field. Warden in his _Recherches_\r\nnoted the early describers. Gen. Harrison discussed the mounds in his\r\n_Discourse on the Aborigines of the Valley of the Ohio_ (Cincinnati,\r\n1838). Squier and Davis, of course, brought them within their\r\nrange,[1757] and Col. Whittlesey supplemented their work in the third\r\nvolume of the _Smithsonian Contributions_. Whittlesey and Matthew C.\r\nRead contributed the Report on the Archæology of Ohio, which forms\r\nthe second portion of the _Final Report of the Ohio State Board of\r\nCentennial Managers_ (Columbus, 1877), and in it is a list of the\r\nancient enclosures, which is not, as Short says (p. 82), as complete\r\nas it should be. A survey of the mounds was made by E. B. Andrews,\r\nand published in the _Peabody Mus. Repts._ (no. x.), 1877. The Ohio\r\nState Archæological and Historical Society started in June, 1887, the\r\n_Ohio archæological and historical Quarterly_, which has vigorously\r\nentered the field, and in it (March, 1888) G. F. Wright has reported\r\non the present condition of the mounds. M. C. Read’s _Archæology of\r\nOhio_ (Cleveland, 1888) was published by the Western Reserve Historical\r\nSociety, whose series of Tracts is of importance for the study of the\r\nmounds.[1758] Henry A. Shepard’s _Antiquities of the State of Ohio_\r\n(Cincinnati, 1887) summarizes the discoveries to date.[1759] Thomas\r\n(_Fifth Rept. Bur. Ethnol._) claims that the Ohio mounds were built\r\nby Indians, but not by the Indians, nor by the ancestors of them, who\r\ninhabited this region at the coming of the whites; but by an Indian\r\nrace driven south, of whom he finds the modern representatives in the\r\nCherokees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF A SECTION OF TWELVE MILES _of the_ SCIOTO VALLEY.\r\n_WITH ITS_ ANCIENT MONUMENTS.\r\n\r\n_LITH.

Some of the best maps\r\nwhich we have showing the geographical positions of groups of mounds\r\naccompany Thomas’s paper in the _Fifth Rept., Bur. Ethnol._]\r\n\r\nThe works at Marietta, on the Muskingum River, were the earliest\r\nobserved. Taking the southern and southeastern counties, there are\r\nno very conspicuous examples elsewhere, though the region is well\r\ndotted with earthworks.[1760] Those at Cincinnati were, after those at\r\nMarietta, the earliest to be noticed.[1761] The adjacent Little Miami\r\nValley is the region which Professor Putnam and Dr. Metz have been of\r\nlate so successfully working.[1762]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WORKS AT NEWARK, OHIO.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_, i. 269, made from surveys\r\n“executed while the chief earthworks could still be traced in all\r\ntheir integrity;” and they “illustrate rites and customs of an ancient\r\nAmerican people, without a parallel among the monumental memorials of\r\nthe old world.” Cf. Atwater, Warden, Squier and Davis, and MacLean.]\r\n\r\nOf all the works in the central portions of Ohio, and indeed of all\r\nin any region, those at Newark, in Licking County, are the most\r\nextensive, and have been often described.[1763] In the east[1764] and\r\nwest[1765] there are other of these earthworks; but those in the north\r\nhave been particularly examined by Col. Whittlesey and others.[1766]\r\nThe enclosure called Fort Azatlan, at Merom on the Wabash River, is\r\nthe most noticeable in Indiana.[1767] In Illinois, the great Cahokia\r\ntruncated pyramid, 700 feet long by 500 wide and 90 high, is the most\r\nimportant.[1768]\r\n\r\nHenry Gillman, of Detroit, has been the leading writer on the mounds\r\nof Michigan.[1769] The supposed connection of their builders with the\r\nancient copper mines of Lake Superior is considered in another place.\r\nThomas (_Fifth Rept., Bur. Ethnol._) contends that much of the copper\r\nfound in the mounds was of European make, and had no relation to any\r\naboriginal mining.\r\n\r\nWisconsin is the central region of what are known as the animal,\r\neffigy, symbolic, or emblematic mounds. Mention has been made elsewhere\r\nof the earliest notices of this kind of earthwork. The most extensive\r\nexamination of them is the _Antiquities of Wisconsin as surveyed and\r\ndescribed by I. A. Lapham_ (Washington, 1855), with a map showing the\r\nsites.[1770] The consideration of these effigy mounds has given rise to\r\nvarious theories regarding their significance, whether as symbols or\r\nto totems.[1771] It is Thomas’s conclusion that the effigy mounds and\r\nthe burial mounds of Wisconsin were the work of the same people (_Fifth\r\nRept., Bur. Ethnol._).\r\n\r\nThe existence of what is called an elephant or mastodon mound in Grant\r\nCounty has been sometimes taken to point to the age of those extinct\r\nanimals as that of the erection of the mounds.[1772] Putnam, referring\r\nto the confined area in which these effigy mounds are found, says that\r\nthe serpent mound, the alligator mound,[1773] and Whittlesey’s effigy\r\nmound in Ohio, and two bird mounds in Georgia,[1774] are the only other\r\nworks in North America to which they are at all comparable.[1775]\r\n\r\nWhen Lewis and Clark explored the Missouri River in 1804-6, they\r\ndiscovered mounds in different parts of its valley; but their\r\nstatements were not altogether confirmed till the parties of the United\r\nStates surveyors traversed the region after the civil war, as is\r\nparticularly shown in Hayden’s _Geological Survey, 6th Rept._, in 1872.\r\nWithin the present State of Missouri the mounds which have attracted\r\nmost notice are those near the modern St. Louis.[1776] In Iowa (Clayton\r\nCounty) there is said to be the largest group of effigy mounds west\r\nof the Mississippi.[1777] The mounds of Iowa and the neighboring\r\nregion are also discussed by Thomas in the _Fifth Rept. Bur. Ethnol._\r\nO. H. Kelley has reported on the remains of an ancient town in\r\nMinnesota.[1778] In Kansas there is little noticeable,[1779] and there\r\nis not much to record in Dacotah,[1780] Utah,[1781] California,[1782]\r\nand Montana.[1783] We find scant accounts of the mounds in Oregon and\r\nWashington in the narrative of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition and\r\nin the earlier story of Lewis and Clark. Some of the mounds are of\r\ndoubtful artificiality.[1784]\r\n\r\nAlong the lower portion of the Mississippi, but not within three\r\nhundred miles of its mouth, we find in Louisiana other mound\r\nconstructions, but not of unusual significance.[1785]\r\n\r\nThe first effigy mound, a bear, which was observed south of the Ohio,\r\nis near an old earthwork in Greenup County, Kentucky.[1786] The mounds\r\nof this State early attracted notice.[1787] Bishop Madison[1788]\r\nthought them sepulchral rather than military. In the _Western Review_\r\n(Dec., 1819) one was described near Lexington. Rafinesque added a\r\nnot very sane account of them to Marshall’s _History of Kentucky_,\r\nin 1824, which was also published separately, and since then all the\r\ngeneral histories of Kentucky have given some attention to these\r\nantiquities.[1789]\r\n\r\nIn Tennessee we find in connection with the earthworks the stone\r\ngraves, which the explorations of Putnam, about ten years ago, brought\r\ninto prominence.[1790] The chief student of the aboriginal mounds\r\nin Georgia has been Col. C. C. Jones, Jr., who has been writing on\r\nthe subject for nearly forty years.[1791] The mounds in the State of\r\nMississippi, as including the region of the Natchez Indians, derive\r\nsome added interest because of the connection sometimes supposed\r\nto exist between them and the race of the mounds.[1792] The same\r\ncharacteristics of the mounds extend into Alabama.[1793] The mounds in\r\nFlorida attracted the early notice of John and William Bartram, and\r\nare described by them in their _Travels_, and have been dwelt upon\r\nby later writers.[1794] The seaboard above Georgia has not much of\r\ninterest.[1795] Concerning the mounds along the Canadian belt there is\r\nhardly more to be said.[1796]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLubbock classes the signs of successive periods in North America thus:\r\noriginal barbarism, mounds, garden beds, and then the relapse into\r\nbarbarism of the red Indian. The agricultural age thus follows that of\r\nthe mound erection, in his view, though, as Putnam says, there seems\r\nenough evidence that the constructors of the old earthworks were an\r\nagricultural race.[1797]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is another class of relics which, outside the hieroglyphics of\r\nCentral America, has as yet had little comprehensive study, though the\r\ngeneral books on American archæology enumerate some of the inscriptions\r\non rocks, which are so widely scattered throughout the continent.[1798]\r\n\r\nOut of all this discussion has risen the new science of Anthropology,\r\nbroad enough in its scope to include not only archæology in its\r\ngeneral acceptation, but to sweep into its range of observation\r\nvarious aspects of ethnology and of geology. It is a new science\r\nas at present formulated; but under other conditions it is traced\r\nfrom its origin with the ancients in a paper by T. Bendyshe in the\r\n_Memoirs of the Anthropological Society of London_ (vol. i. 335).\r\nIts progress in America is treated by O. T. Mason in the _American\r\nNaturalist_ (xiv. 348; xv. 616). The most approved methods of modern\r\nresearch are explained in Emil Schmidt’s _Anthropologische Methoden;\r\nAnleitung zum beobachten und sammeln für Laboratorium und Reise_\r\n(Leipzig, 1888). “The methods of archæological investigation are as\r\ntrustworthy as those of any natural science,” says Lubbock (_Scientific\r\nLectures_, 139). Beside the publications of the various Archæological,\r\nAnthropological, and Ethnological Societies and Congresses[1799]\r\nof both hemispheres, we find for Europe a considerable centre of\r\ninformation in the _Materiaux pour l’histoire primitive et naturelle\r\n(philosophique) de l’homme_,[1800] and for America in the publications\r\nof the Smithsonian Institution,[1801] in the _Comptes rendus_ of the\r\nsuccessive Congresses of Américanistes, and in such periodicals as the\r\n_American Antiquarian_, the _American Anthropologist_, and the _Folk\r\nLore Journal_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAJOR POWELL.]\r\n\r\nThe broad subject of prehistoric archæology is covered in a paper\r\nby Lubbock, which is included in his _Scientific Lectures_ (Lond.,\r\n1879);[1802] in H. M. Westropp’s _Prehistoric Phases, or Introductory\r\nEssays on Prehistoric Archæology_ (Lond., 1872); in Stevens’s _Flint\r\nChips_ (1870); by Dr. Brinton in the _Iconographic Encyclopædia_, vol.\r\nii.; and more popularly in Charles F. Keary’s _Dawn of History, an\r\nintrod. to prehistoric study_ (N. Y., 1879), and in Davenport Adams’s\r\n_Beneath the Surface, or the Underground World_.\r\n\r\nThe French have contributed a corresponding literature in Louis\r\nFiguier’s _L’Homme Primitif_ (Paris, 1870);[1803] in Zaborowski’s\r\n_L’homme préhistorique_ (Paris, 1878); and in the Marquis de\r\nNadaillac’s _Les premiers hommes et les temps préhistoriques_ (Paris,\r\n1881), and his _Mœurs et monuments des peuples préhistoriques_ (Paris,\r\n1888), not to mention others.[1804]\r\n\r\nThe principal comprehensive works covering the prehistoric period in\r\nNorth America, are J. T. Short’s _North Americans of Antiquity_ (N.\r\nY., 1879, and later); the _L’Amérique préhistorique_ of Nadaillac\r\n(Paris, 1883);[1805] Foster’s _Prehistoric Races of the United States_\r\n(Chicago, 1873; 6th ed., 1887); and the compact popular _Ancient\r\nAmerica_ (N. Y., 1871) of John D. Baldwin. Beside Bancroft’s _Native\r\nRaces_, there are various treatises of confined nominal scope, but\r\ncovering in some degree the whole North American field, which are noted\r\nin other pages.[1806]\r\n\r\nThe purely ethnological aspects of the American side of the subject\r\nare summarily surveyed in A. H. Keane’s “Ethnology of America,”\r\nappended to Stanford’s _Compendium of Geography, Cent. America_,\r\netc. (London, 2nd ed., 1882), and there are papers on Ethnographical\r\nCollections in the _Smithsonian Report_ (1862).[1807] The great\r\nrepository of material, however, is in the _Contributions to North\r\nAmerican Ethnology_, being a section of Major Powell’s _Survey of the\r\nRocky Mountain Region_, and in the _Annual Reports_ of the Bureau of\r\nEthnology since 1879, made under Major Powell’s directions, and in the\r\n_Reports of the Peabody Museum_.[1808]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY OF ABORIGINAL AMERICA.\r\n\r\n_By the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE student will find a general survey of “Les Sources de l’histoire\r\nanté-Colombienne du nouveau monde, par Léon de Rosny,” in the _Revue\r\nOrientale et Américaine_ (_Mém. de la soc. d’ethnographie_) _session\r\nde 1877_ (p. 139). Bancroft in his _Native Races_ (v. 136) makes a\r\nsimilar grouping of the classes of sources relating to the primitive\r\nAmericans.[1809] These classes are defined in Daniel G. Brinton’s\r\n_Review of the data for the study of the prehistoric chronology of\r\nAmerica_ (Salem, 1887), from the _Proceedings of the Amer. Asso. for\r\nthe Advancement of Science_ (vol. xxxvi.), as conveniently divided into\r\ngroups pertaining to legendary, monumental, industrial, linguistic,\r\nphysical, and geological phenomena.\r\n\r\nThere have been given in the Introduction of the present volume the\r\ntitles of general bibliographies of American histories, most of which\r\ninclude more or less of the titles pertaining to aboriginal times.\r\nIt is the purpose of the present brief essay to enumerate, in an\r\napproximately chronological order, the titles of some of those and of\r\nothers which are useful to the archæologist. So far as they are of\r\nservice to the student of the American languages, an extended list will\r\nbe found prefixed to Pilling’s _Proof-Sheets_ (p. xi).\r\n\r\nThe earliest American bibliography was that of Antonio de Leon,\r\nusually called Pinelo,—_Epitome de la Biblioteca oriental y occidental\r\nnáutica y Geográfica_ (Madrid, 1629),—but which is usually found in\r\nthe edition of Gonzales de Barcía, “Añadido y enmendado nuevamente”\r\n(Paris, 1737-1738), in which the American titles, including numerous\r\nmanuscripts, are given in the second volume.[1810]\r\n\r\nThe _Bibliotheca Hispana Nova_ of Nicolás Antonio was first published\r\nat Rome in 1672, but in a second edition at Madrid in 1783-88.[1811]\r\n\r\nPassing by the _Bibliotheca Mexicana_ of Eguiara y Eguren,[1812] and\r\nthe early edition of Beristain, we note the new edition of the latter,\r\nprepared not by Juan Evangelista Guadalajara, as Brasseur notes,[1813]\r\nbut by another, as the title shows,—_Biblioteca Hispano-Americana\r\nSeptentrional, ó catalogo y noticia de los Literatos que ó nacidos,\r\nó educados, ó florecientes en la America Septentrional Española, han\r\ndado á luz algun escrito ó lo han dexado preparado para la prensa por\r\nJosé Mariano Beristain y Martin de Souza. Segunda edicion, por Fortino\r\nHipólito Vera_ (Amecameca, 1883).\r\n\r\nDr. Robertson intimates that the lists of books which writers of\r\nthe seventeenth century had been in the habit of prefixing to their\r\nbooks as evidence of their industry had come to be regarded as an\r\nostentatious expression of their learning, and with some hesitancy he\r\ncounted out to the reader his 717 titles; but Clavigero, as elsewhere\r\npointed out,[1814] was richer in such resources. Humboldt, in his\r\n_Vues_,[1815] gives a list of the authors which he cites.\r\n\r\nThe class of dealers’ catalogues—we cite only such as have decided\r\nbibliographical value—begins to be conspicuous in Paul Trömel’s\r\n_Bibliothèque Américaine_ (Leipzig, 1861), the best of the German ones,\r\nand in Charles Leclerc’s _Bibliotheca Americana_ (Paris, 1867), much\r\nimproved in his _Bibliotheca Americana. Histoire, géographie, voyages,\r\narchéologie et linguistique des deux Amériques et des îles Philippines_\r\n(Paris, 1878), with later supplements, constituting the best of the\r\nFrench catalogues, provided with an excellent index and a linguistic\r\ntable, rendered necessary by the classified plan of the list.\r\n\r\nThe list formed by students in this field begins with the _Bibliotheca\r\nAmericana Vetustissima_ of Harrisse (New York, 1866; additions, Paris,\r\n1872), and includes the _Bibliothèque Mexico-Guatémalienne, précédée\r\nd’un coup d’œil sur les études américaines dans leurs rapports avec\r\nles études classiques, et suivie du tableau, par ordre alphabétique,\r\ndes ouvrages de linguistique Américaine contenus dans le même volume_\r\n(Paris, 1871) of the Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, who at that time had\r\nbeen twenty-five years engaged in the studies and travels which led to\r\nthe gathering of his collection. The library, almost entire, was later\r\njoined to that of Alphonse L. Pinart, and was included in the latter’s\r\n_Catalogue de livres rares et précieux, manuscrits et imprimés_ (Paris,\r\n1883).\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Icazbalceta published at Mexico his _Apuntes para un Catálogo\r\nde Escritores en lenguas indígenas de América_,[1816] but of his great\r\nbibliographical work only one volume has as yet appeared: _Bibliografía\r\nAméricana del Siglo xvi. Primera parte_. _Catálogo razonado de libros\r\nimpresos en México de 1539 à 1600, con biografías de autores y otras\r\nilustraciones, precedido de una noticia acerca de la introducción de la\r\nimprenta en México_ (México, 1886).\r\n\r\nBandelier has embodied some of the results of his study in his “Notes\r\non the Bibliography of Yucatan and Central America,” in the _Amer.\r\nAntiq. Soc. Proc._, n. s., i. pp. 82-118.\r\n\r\nThe catalogues of collections having special reference to aboriginal\r\nAmerica are the following:—\r\n\r\n_Catalogue de la Bibliothèque de José Maria Andrade, 7,000 pièces et\r\nvolumes, ayant rapport au Méxique ou imprimés dans ce pays_ (Leipzig,\r\n1869).[1817]\r\n\r\n_Bibliotheca Mejicana_: _Books and manuscripts almost wholly relating\r\nto the history and literature of North and South America, particularly\r\nMexico_ (London, 1869). This collection was formed by Augustin Fischer,\r\nchaplain to the Emperor Maximilian; but there were added to the\r\ncatalogue some titles from the collection of Dr. C. H. Berendt.\r\n\r\n_Catalogue of the library of E. G. Squier, edited by Joseph Sabin_ (N.\r\nY., 1876).\r\n\r\n_Bibliotheca Mexicana, or A Catalogue of the library of the rare books\r\nand important MSS. relating to Mexico and other parts of Spanish\r\nAmerica, formed by the late Señor Don José Fernando Ramirez_ (London,\r\n1880). This catalogue was edited by the Abbé Fischer.[1818]\r\n\r\nThe most useful guides to the literature of aboriginal America,\r\nhowever, are some compiled in this country. First, the comprehensive\r\nthough not yet complete bibliography, Joseph Sabin’s _Dictionary of\r\nbooks relating to America_, now being continued since Sabin’s death,\r\nand with much skill, by Wilberforce Eames. Second, the voluminous\r\n_Proof-sheets of a Bibliography of the languages of the North\r\nAmerican Indians_ (Washington, 1885), prepared by James Constantine\r\nPilling, tentatively, in a large quarto volume, distributed only to\r\ncollaborators, and out of which, with emendations and additions, he is\r\nnow publishing special sections of it, of which have already appeared\r\nthose relating to the Eskimo and Siouan tongues. His enumeration\r\nso much exceeds the range of purely linguistic monographs that the\r\ntreatises become in effect general bibliographies of aboriginal America.\r\n\r\nThird, _An Essay towards an Indian bibliography, being a Catalogue\r\nof books relating to the history, antiquities, languages, customs,\r\nreligion, wars, literature and origin of the American Indians, in the\r\nlibrary of Thos. W. Field, with bibliographical and historical notes\r\nand synopses of the contents of some of the works least known_ (N. Y.,\r\n1873). The sale of Mr. Field’s library took place in New York, May,\r\n1875, from a Catalogue not so elaborate, but still of use. These books\r\nare not so accurately compiled as to be wholly trustworthy as final\r\nresorts.\r\n\r\nFinally, the list prefixed to Bancroft’s _Native Races_, vol. i.,\r\nand the references of his foot-notes, throughout his five volumes\r\n(condensed often in Short’s _North Americans of Antiquity_), are\r\non the whole the most serviceable aids to the general student, but\r\nunfortunately the index of the set is of no use in searching for\r\nbibliographical detail.\r\n\r\nThe reader will remember that the bibliographies of sectional or\r\npartial import in the field of American archæology are referred to\r\nelsewhere in the present volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE COMPREHENSIVE TREATISES ON AMERICAN ANTIQUITIES.\r\n\r\n_By the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the time when Bancroft published his _Native Races_ (1875),\r\nhe referred to John D. Baldwin’s _Ancient America_ (N. Y., 1871)\r\nas the only preceding, comprehensive book on America before the\r\nSpaniards.[1819] It still remains a convenient book of small compass;\r\nbut its absence of references to sources precludes its usefulness for\r\npurposes of study, and it is not altogether abreast of the latest\r\nviews. To the popular element a moderate share of the indexical\r\ncharacter, rendering the book passably serviceable to the average\r\nreader, has been added in the somewhat larger _North Americans\r\nof Antiquity, their origin, migrations, and type of civilization\r\nconsidered, by John T. Short_ (N. Y., 1880,—somewhat improved in later\r\neditions), though it will be observed that the Peruvian and other\r\nSouth American antiquities have not come within his plan. The latest\r\nof these comprehensive books is the Marquis de Nadaillac’s (Jean F.\r\nA. du Pouget’s) _L’Amérique préhistorique_ (Paris, 1883), which in an\r\nEnglish version by N. D’Anvers was published with the author’s sanction\r\nin London in 1882. With revision and some modifications by W. H.\r\nDall, which have not met the author’s sanction, it was republished as\r\n_Prehistoric America_ (N. Y., 1884). It is a work of more theoretical\r\ntendency than the student wishes to find at the opening stage of his\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nBut as a compend of every department of archæological knowledge up to\r\nabout fifteen years ago no advance has yet been made upon Bancroft’s\r\n_Native Races_ as indicative of every channel of investigation which\r\nthe student can pursue. Upon the monuments of the moundbuilders (iv.\r\nch. 13) and the antiquities of Peru (iv. ch. 14) the treatment is\r\ncondensed and without references, as occupying a field beyond his\r\nprimary purpose of covering the Pacific slope of North America and the\r\nimmediately adjacent regions. Mention is made elsewhere of Bancroft’s\r\nmethods of compilation, and it may suffice to say that in the five\r\nvolumes of his _Native Races_ he has drawn and condensed his matter\r\nfrom the writings of about 1200 writers, whose titles he gives in a\r\npreliminary list.[1820] The method of arranging the departments of the\r\nwork is perhaps too far geographical to be always satisfactory to the\r\nspecial student,[1821] and he seems to be aware of it (for instance, i.\r\nch. 2); but it may be questioned if, while writing with, or engrafting\r\nupon, an encyclopædic system, what might pass for a continuous\r\nnarrative, any more scientific plan would have been more successful.\r\nBancroft’s opinions are not always as satisfactory as his material.\r\nThe student who uses the _Native Races_ for its groups and references\r\nwill accordingly find a complemental service in Sir Daniel Wilson’s\r\n_Prehistoric Man_ (London, 1876), in which the Toronto professor\r\nconducts his “researches into the origin of civilization in the old and\r\nthe new world,” by primarily treating of the early American man, as the\r\nreadiest way of understanding early man in Europe. His system is to\r\nconnect man’s development topically in the directions induced by his\r\nhabits, industries, dwellings, art, records, migrations, and physical\r\ncharacterizations.\r\n\r\nAnother and older book, in some respects embodying like purposes,\r\nand though produced at a time when archæological studies were much\r\nless advanced than at present, is Alexander W. Bradford’s _American\r\nAntiquities and researches into the origin and history of the red\r\nrace_ (N. Y., 1841).[1822] The first section of the book is strictly\r\na record of results; but in the final portion the author indulges\r\nmore in speculative inquiry. Even in this he has not transcended the\r\nbounds of legitimate hypothesis, though some of his postulates will\r\nhardly be accepted nowadays, as when he contends that the red Indians\r\nare the degraded descendants of the people who were connected with the\r\nso-called civilization of Central America.[1823]\r\n\r\nThe periodical literature of a comprehensive sort is not so\r\nextensive as treatments of special aspects; but the student will find\r\nPoole’s _Index_ and Rhee’s _Catalogue and Index of the Smithsonian\r\npublications_ serviceable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON THE INDUSTRIES AND TRADE OF THE AMERICAN\r\nABORIGINES.\r\n\r\n_By the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE we have a moderate list of works on the general subject of\r\nprehistoric art and industries,[1824] we lack any comprehensive survey\r\nof the subject as respects the American continent, and must depend on\r\nsectional and local treatment. Humboldt in the introduction to his\r\n_Atlas_ of his _Essai politique_ (Paris, 1813) was among the earliest\r\nto grasp the material which illustrates the origin and first progress\r\nof the arts in America. The arts of the southern regions and western\r\ncoasts of North America are best followed in those portions of the\r\nchapters on the Wild Tribes, devoted to the subject, which make up\r\nthe first volume of Bancroft’s _Native Races_,[1825] and for Mexican\r\nand Maya productions some chapters (ch. 15, 24) in the second volume.\r\nPrescott’s treatment of the more advanced peoples of this region is\r\nscant (_Mexico_, i., introd., ch. 5). The art in stone of the Pueblo\r\nIndians is beautifully illustrated in Putnam’s portion of Wheeler’s\r\n_Report_ of his survey, and comparison may be made with Hayden’s\r\n_Annual Rept._ (1876) of the U. S. Geol. and Geographical Survey.\r\nThe work of Putnam and his collaborators in the archæological volume\r\n(vii.) of Wheeler’s _Survey_ is probably the most complete account of\r\nthe implements, ornaments and utensils of any one people (those of\r\nSouthern California) yet produced; and its illustrations have not been\r\nsurpassed. Passing north, we shall get some help from E. L. Berthoud’s\r\npaper on the “Prehistoric human art from Wyoming and Colorado,” in his\r\n“Journal of a reconnaissance in Creek Valley, Col.,” published by the\r\nColorado Acad. of Nat. Sciences (_Proceedings_, 1872, p. 46). In the\r\n_Pacific Rail Road Reports_ (vol. iii. in 1856) there is a paper by\r\nThomas Ewbank in “Illustrations of Indian antiquities and arts.” S. S.\r\nHaldeman has described the relics of human industry found in a rock\r\nshelter in southeastern Pennsylvania (_Compte Rendu, Cong. des Amér._,\r\nLuxembourg, ii. 319; and _Transactions Amer. Philos. Soc._, 1878). The\r\nbest of all the more comprehensive monographs is Charles C. Abbott’s\r\n_Primitive industry: or illustrations of the handiwork, in stone, bone\r\nand clay, of the native races of the Northern Atlantic seaboard of\r\nAmerica_ (Salem, 1881). Morgan’s _League of the Iroquois_ touches in\r\nsome measure of the arts of that confederacy, his earliest study being\r\nin the _Fifth Report of the Regents of the State of New York_ (1852).\r\n\r\nFor the Canada regions, the _Annual Reports of the Canadian Institute_,\r\nappended to the _Reports_ of the Minister of Education, Ontario,\r\ncontain accounts of the discovery of objects of stone, horn, and shell.\r\n(See particularly the sessions of 1886-87.) Dawson in his _Fossil men_\r\n(ch. 6) considers what he accounts the lost arts of the primitive races\r\nof North America. On the other hand, Professor Leidy found still in use\r\namong the present Shoshones split pebbles resembling the rudest stone\r\nimplements of the palæolithic period (_U. S. Geological Survey_, 1872,\r\np. 652).\r\n\r\nMany archæologists have remarked on the uniform character of many\r\nprehistoric implements, wherever found, as precluding their being\r\nheld as ethnical evidences. The system of quarrying[1826] for flint\r\nbest fitted for the tool-maker’s art has been observed by Wilson\r\n(_Prehistoric man_, i. 68) both in the old and new world, and in\r\nhis third chapter (vol. i.) we have a treatise on the ancient\r\nstone-worker’s art.[1827]\r\n\r\nTreating the subject topically, we find the late Charles Rau making\r\nsome special studies of the implements used in native agriculture[1828]\r\nin the _Smithsonian Reports_ for 1863, 1868, and 1869.[1829] The\r\nagriculture of the Aztecs and Mayas is treated in Max Steffen’s _Die\r\nLandwirtschaft bei den altamerikanischen Kulturvölkern_ (Leipzig,\r\n1883).[1830]\r\n\r\nThe working of flint or obsidian into arrowpoints or cutting implements\r\nis a process by pressure that has not been wholly lost. Old workshops,\r\nor the chips of them, have been discovered, and they are found in\r\nnumerous localities (Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_, i. 75, 79; Abbott’s\r\n_Primitive Industry_, and Putnam in the _Bull. Essex Institute_),\r\nbut Powell in his _Report of Explorations of the Colorado of the\r\nWest_ (1873) does not, as Wilson says he does, describe the present\r\nways.[1831]\r\n\r\nWilson (_Prehistoric Man_, i. ch. 4 and 7) in an essay on the bone and\r\nivory workers substitutes for the corresponding words usually employed\r\nin classifying stone implements the terms palæotechnic and neotechnic,\r\nas indicating periods of progress, in order that the art of making\r\ntools in horn, bone, shell, and ivory might have a better recognition,\r\nas of equal importance with that of making such in stone. Separate\r\ntreatises are few. Morgan has a paper on the bone implements of the\r\nArickarees in the _21st Rept. of the Regents of the University of the\r\nState of N. Y._ (1871), and Rau’s monograph on _Prehistoric fishing in\r\nEurope and North America, one of the Smithsonian Contributions_ (1884),\r\ninvolves the making of fish-hooks of bone. See also Putnam in the\r\n_Peabody Museum Reports_, and in _Wheeler’s Survey_, vol. vii.; Wyman’s\r\ncontributions on the shell heaps, and the _Journal of the Cincinnati\r\nSoc. of Nat. Hist_. for such as have been found in the ash-pits of\r\nMadisonville. On shell-work there is a section in Foster’s _Prehistoric\r\nRaces_ (p. 234); a paper by W. H. Holmes in the _Second Rept. of the\r\nBureau of Ethnology_ (p. 179); and one on American shell-work and its\r\naffinities by Miss Buckland in the _Journal Anthropol. Inst._, xvi. 155.\r\n\r\nFrom the primitive materials of stone, bone, horn, or shell, we pass\r\nto metals; but as Wilson (i. p. 174) says, “if metal could be found\r\ncapable of being wrought and fashioned without smelting or moulding,\r\nits use was perfectly compatible with the simple arts of the stone\r\nperiod, as a mere malleable stone;” and to the present day, he adds,\r\nthe rude American race has no knowledge of working metal, except by\r\npounding or grinding it cold.[1832] The story which Brereton tells\r\nin his account of Gosnold’s visit (1602) to New England, about the\r\nfinding of abundant metal implements in use among the natives, is\r\nquestioned (Baldwin’s _Ancient America_, p. 62). We have the evidences\r\nof the early mining[1833] of copper extending for over a hundred miles\r\nalong the southern shores of Lake Superior and on Isle Royale, in the\r\nabandoned trenches and tools first discovered in 1847; and in one case\r\nthere was found a mass of native copper (ten feet by three and two, and\r\nweighing over six tons) which had been elevated on a wooden frame prior\r\nto removal, and was discovered in this condition.[1834] There are also\r\nindications that the manufacture of copper tools was carried on in the\r\nneighborhood of the mines (Wilson, i. 213); and chemical tests have\r\nshown that a popular belief in the tempering of metal by these early\r\npeoples is without foundation.[1835]\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a fact that while in the use of metals an intermediate\r\nstage of pure copper, as coming between the use of bone and stone\r\nand the use of alloyed metals, was not until comparatively recently\r\nsuspected in Great Britain, the “peculiar interest attaches to the\r\nmetallurgy of the new world that there all the earlier stages are\r\nclearly defined: the pure native metal wrought by the hammer without\r\nthe aid of fire; the melted and moulded copper; the alloyed bronze;\r\nand the smelting, soldering, graving, and other processes resulting\r\nfrom accumulating experience and matured skill” (Wilson, i. 230).\r\nIt is in the regions extending from Mexico to Peru that the art of\r\nalloying introduces us to the American bronze age. Columbus in his\r\nfourth voyage found in a vessel which had come alongside from Yucatan\r\ncrucibles to melt copper, as Herrera tells us; and Humboldt was among\r\nthe earliest to discover tools alloyed of copper and tin, and many such\r\nalloys have since been recognized among Peruvian bronzes (Wilson, i.\r\n239). In Mexico, metallurgic arts were carried perhaps even farther\r\nin casting and engraving, and not only the results but the evidences\r\nof their mining places have remained to our day (_Ibid._ i. 248). It\r\nseems evident, however, that experimenting with them had not carried\r\nthem so near the perfect combination for tool-making (one part tin to\r\nnine parts copper) as the bronze people of Europe had reached, though\r\nthey fell considerably short of the exact standard (_Ibid._ i. 234).\r\nDoubt has sometimes been expressed of Mexican mining for copper, as\r\nby Frederick von Hellwald (_Compte Rendu, Cong. des Américanistes_,\r\n1877, i. 51); but Rau indicated the references[1836] to Short (p.\r\n94), which forcibly led him to the conclusion that the Mexicans mined\r\ncopper to turn into tools.[1837] Among the Mayas, Nadaillac (p. 269)\r\ncontends that only copper and gold were in use. Bancroft (ii. 749)\r\nthinks the use of copper doubtful, and if used, that it must have\r\nbeen got from the north. He cites the evidences of the use of gold.\r\nWilliam H. Holmes discusses _The use of gold and other metals among\r\nthe ancient inhabitants of Chiriqui, Isthmus of Darien_ (Washington,\r\n1887). As to iron, that found in the Ohio mounds, only of late years,\r\nhas been proved to be meteoric iron by Professor Putnam (_Amer. Antiq.\r\nSoc. Proc._, Apr., 1883). Bancroft (i. 164) says iron was in use among\r\nthe British Columbian tribes before contact with the whites, but it\r\nwas probably derived through some indirect means from the whites.\r\nThough iron ore abounds in Peru, and the character of the Peruvian\r\nstone-cutting would seem to indicate its use, and though there is a\r\nnative word for it, no iron implements have been found.[1838] There is\r\nnot much recorded of the use of silver. It has been found by Putnam in\r\nthe mounds in thin sheets, used as plating for other metals.[1839] He\r\nhas also found native silver in masses, and in one case a small bit of\r\nhammered gold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWilson, in 1876, while regretting the dispersion of the William\r\nBullock collection of pottery, the destruction of that formed by\r\nStephens and Catherwood, and the transference to an English museum\r\nof most of the specimens gathered by Squier and Davis, lamented that\r\nno American collection[1840] had been yet formed adequate to the\r\nrequirements of the students of American archæology and ethnology.\r\nSince that date, however, the collections in the National Museum\r\n(Smithsonian Institution) at Washington and in the Peabody Museum at\r\nCambridge have largely grown; and especially for the fictile art and\r\nwork in stone of Spanish North America the Museo Nacional in Mexico has\r\nassumed importance. The collection in the possession of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society in Philadelphia,[1841] since transferred to the\r\nPhiladelphia Academy, is also of value for the study of the pottery of\r\nmiddle America.\r\n\r\nRau has supplied a leading paper on American pottery in the\r\n_Smithsonian Report_, 1866; and E. A. Barber has touched the subject\r\nin papers at the Copenhagen, Luxembourg, and Madrid meetings of the\r\nCongrès des Américanistes, and in the _American Antiquarian_ (viii.\r\n76).[1842] W. H. Holmes has a paper on the origin and development of\r\nform and of ornament in ceramic art in the _Fourth Report, Bureau of\r\nEthnology_, p. 437.\r\n\r\nFor local characters there are various monographs.[1843]\r\n\r\nThere is no satisfactory evidence that the potter’s wheel was known\r\nto any American tribe; but Wilson, in his chapter on ceramic art\r\n(_Prehistoric Man_, ii. ch. 16), feels convinced that the early potter\r\nemployed some sort of mechanical process, giving a revolving motion to\r\nhis clay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEXICAN CLAY MASK.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in _Wilson’s Prehistoric Man_, ii. p. 33, of an example in\r\nthe collections of the American Philosophical Society, in a totally\r\ndifferent style from the usual Mexican terra-cottas; and Wilson remarks\r\nof it that one will look in vain in it for the Indian physiognomy.\r\nTyler, _Anahuac_, 230, considers it a forgery.]\r\n\r\nModelling in clay for other purposes than the making of vessels is\r\nalso considered in this same seventeenth chapter of Wilson, and the\r\nsubject runs, as respects masks, figurines, and general ornamentation,\r\ninto the wide range of aboriginal art, which necessarily makes part of\r\nall comprehensive histories of art. W. H. Dall has a paper on Indian\r\nmasks in the _Third Report, Bureau of Ethnology_, p. 73. The subject is\r\nfurther treated by Wilson in a paper on “The artistic faculty in the\r\naboriginal races,” in the _Proceedings_ (iii., 2d part, 67, 119) of the\r\nRoyal Society of Canada, and again in a general way by Nadaillac on\r\n_L’art préhistorique en Amérique_ (Paris, 1883), taken from the _Revue\r\ndes deux Mondes_, Nov. 1, 1883.[1844]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs regards the textile art in prehistoric times, see for a general view\r\nW. H. Holmes in the _American Antiquarian_, viii. 261; and the same\r\narchæologist has treated the subject on the evidences of the impression\r\nof textures as preserved in pottery, in the _Third Rept. Bur. of\r\nEthnology_, p. 393. Cf. Sellers in _Popular Science Journal_, and Wyman\r\nin _Peabody Museum Reports_.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Foster first made (1838) the discovery of relics of textile\r\nfabrics of the moundbuilders; but he did not announce his discovery\r\ntill at the Albany meeting (1851) of the American Association for\r\nthe Advancement of Science (_Transactions_, 1852, vol. vi. p. 375).\r\nHe tells the story in his _Prehistoric Races_, p. 222, and figures\r\nthe implements, found in the mounds, supposed to be employed in the\r\nmaking their cloth with warp and woof. Putnam has since made similar\r\ndiscoveries (_Peabody Museum Reports_). The subject is also treated\r\nin the _Proceedings_ of the Davenport Academy and of the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science. The fabrics were preserved\r\nby being placed in contact with copper implements.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of New Mexico were found by the Spaniards in possession\r\nof the art of weaving. Cf. Washington Matthews on the Navajo weavers,\r\nin the _Third Rept. Bur. of Ethnology_, p. 371, and Bancroft (i.\r\n582), who also records the making of fabrics by the wild tribes of\r\nCentral America (_Ibid._ i. 766-67). He also notes the references to\r\nthe textile manufactures of the Nahuas and Mayas (ii. 484, 752). The\r\nrichest accumulation of graphic data relative to the fabrics of Peru is\r\ncontained in the great work on the _Necropolis of Ancon_.\r\n\r\nFeather-work was an important industry in some parts of the continent.\r\nThe subject is studied in Ferdinand Denis’ _Arte plumaria: Les plumes,\r\nleur valeur et leur emploi dans les arts au Méxique, au Pérou, au\r\nBrésil et dans les Indes et dans l’Océanie_ (Paris, 1875).[1845]\r\n\r\nLewis H. Morgan’s _Houses and House-life of the American Aborigines_\r\n(Washington, 1881) is the completest study of the habitations of\r\nthe early peoples; but it is written too exclusively in the light\r\nof universal communal custom, and this must be borne in mind in\r\nusing it. The edifices of middle America and Peru have been given a\r\nbibliographical apparatus in another part of the present volume; but\r\nreferences may be made to Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_ (ii. ch. 16),\r\nViollet le Duc’s _Habitations of Man_, translated by R. Bucknall\r\n(Boston, 1876), and to Bandelier’s _Archæological Tour_, 226, where he\r\nquotes as typical the description of a native house in 1583, drawn by\r\nJuan Bautista Pomar.\r\n\r\nThere is no good comprehensive account of American prehistoric trade.\r\nThe T-shaped pieces of copper in use by the Mexicans came nearest to\r\ncurrency as we understand it, unless it be the wampum of the North\r\nAmerican Indians, and the shell money in use on the Pacific coast;\r\nbut it should be remembered that copper axes and copper plates served\r\nsuch a purpose with some tribes.[1846] The Peruvians used weights, but\r\nthe Mexicans did not. The latter had, however, a system of measures\r\nof length.[1847] The canoe was a great intermediary in the practice\r\nof barter.[1848] The Peruvians alone understood the use of sails,\r\nand the earliest Spanish navigators on the Pacific were surprised at\r\nwhat they thought were civilized predecessors in those seas when they\r\nespied in the distance the large white sails of the Peruvian rafts of\r\nburden.[1849] The chief source of trade in such conditions was barter,\r\nand we know how the Mexican travelling merchants got information\r\nthat was availed of by the Mexican marauders in their invasions.\r\nBandelier[1850] gives us the references on the barter system, the\r\ntraders, and the currency in that country, and we need to consult Dr.\r\nW. Behrnauer’s _Essai sur le Commerce dans l’ancien Méxique et en\r\nPérou_, in the _Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France_ (n. s., vol. i.).\r\n\r\nAll the treatises on the mounds of the Ohio Valley derive\r\nillustrations of intertribal traffic from the shells of the coast, the\r\ncopper of Lake Superior, the mica of the Alleghanies, the obsidian of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains or of Mexico, and the unique figurines which the\r\nexplorations of the mounds have disclosed. Charles Rau has a paper on\r\nthis aboriginal trade in North America, published in the _Archiv für\r\nAnthroplogie_ (Braunschweig, 1872, vol. iv.), which was republished\r\nin English in the _Smithsonian Report_, 1872, p. 249. Bancroft’s\r\nreferences under “Commerce” (v. p. 668) will help the student out in\r\nvarious particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON AMERICAN LINGUISTICS.\r\n\r\n_By the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nIT cannot be said that the study of American linguistics has\r\nadvanced to a position wholly satisfactory. It is beset with all the\r\ndifficulties belonging to a subject that has not been embraced in\r\nwritten records for long periods, and it is open to the hazards of\r\narticulation and hearing, acting without entire mutual confidence.\r\nAnd yet we may not dispute Max Müller’s belief,[1851] that it is the\r\nscience of language which has given the first comprehensive impulse to\r\nthe study of mankind.\r\n\r\nOut of the twenty distinct sounds which it is said the voice of\r\nman can produce,[1852] there have been built up from roots and\r\ncombinations a great diversity of vocabularies. Comparisons of these,\r\nas well as of the methods of forming sentences, have been much used\r\nin investigations of ethnical relations. Of these opposing methods,\r\nneither is sufficiently strong, it is probable, to be pressed without\r\nthe aid of the other, though the belief of the Bureau of Ethnology at\r\nWashington, under the influence of Major Powell, practically discards\r\nall tests but the vocabulary, in tracing ethnological relations. It\r\nis held that this one test of words satisfies, as to customs, myths,\r\nand other ethnological traits, more demands of classifications than\r\nany other. Granted that it does, there are questions yet unsolvable\r\nby it; and many ethnologists hold that there are still other tests,\r\nphysiological, for instance,[1853] which cannot safely be neglected\r\nin settling such complex questions. The favorite claim of the Bureau\r\nis that its officers are studying man as a human being, and not as an\r\nanimal; but it is by no means sure that the physical qualities of man\r\nare so disconnected with his mind and soul as to be unnecessary to\r\nhis interpretation. Even if language be given the chief place in such\r\nstudies, there is still the doubt if the vocabulary can in all ways\r\nbe safely followed to the exclusion of the structure of the language;\r\nand it is not to be forgotten, as Haven recognized thirty years ago,\r\nthat “one of the greatest obstacles to a successful and satisfactory\r\ncomparison of Indian vocabularies is caused by the capricious and\r\never-varying orthography applied by writers of different nations.” This\r\nis a chance of error that cannot be eliminated when we have to deal\r\nwith lists of words made in the past, by persons not to be communicated\r\nwith, in whom both national and personal peculiarities of ear and vocal\r\norgans may exist to perplex. A part of the difficulty is of course\r\nremoved by trained assistants acting in concert, though in different\r\nfields; but the individual sharpness or dulness of ear and purity and\r\nobscurity of articulation will still cause diversity of results,—to say\r\nnothing of corresponding differences in the persons questioned. There\r\nis still the problem, broader than all these divisionary tests, whether\r\nlanguage is at all a safe test of race, and on this point there is\r\nroom for different opinions, as is shown in the discussions of Sayce,\r\nWhitney, and others.[1854] “Any attempt,” says Max Müller, “at squaring\r\nthe classification of races and tongues must necessarily fail.”[1855]\r\nOn the other hand, George Bancroft (Final revision, ii. 90) says that\r\n“the aspect of the red men was so uniform that there is no method of\r\ngrouping them into families but by their languages.”\r\n\r\nIt is the wide margin for error, already indicated, that vitiates\r\nmuch that has already been done in philological comparisons, and the\r\nover-eager recognition at all times of what is thought to be the\r\nword-shunting of “Grimm’s Law” has doubtless been responsible for other\r\nconfusions.[1856]\r\n\r\nMost of the general philological treatises touch more or less\r\nintimately the question of language as a test of race,[1857] and\r\nall of them engage in tracing affinities, each with confidence in\r\na method that others with equal assurance may belittle.[1858] Thus\r\nBancroft,[1859] reflecting an opinion long prevalent, says that\r\n“positive grammatical rules carry with them much more weight than mere\r\nword likenesses,”[1860] while, on the contrary, Dawson[1861] says that\r\n“grammar is, after all, only the clothing of language. The science\r\nconsists in its root-words; and multitudes of root-words are identical\r\nin the American languages over vast areas.” This last proposition is,\r\nas we have seen, the principle on which this inquiry is now conducted\r\nwith governmental patronage. “Each American language,” says George\r\nBancroft, in his chapter on the dialects of North America, “was\r\ncompetent of itself, without improvement of scholars, to exemplify\r\nevery rule of the logician and give utterance to every passion.” In\r\naccordance with such perhaps extreme views, it has been usually said\r\nthat the American languages are in development in advance of aboriginal\r\nprogress in other respects. It is another common observation that while\r\na certain resemblance runs through all the native tongues,[1862] there\r\nis no such general resemblance to the old-world languages;[1863] but\r\nat the same time the linguistic proof of the unity of the American\r\nrace is not irrefragable,[1864] and it would take tens of thousands of\r\nyears, as Brinton holds, if there had been a single source, for the\r\neighty stocks of the North American and for the hundred South American\r\nspeeches to have developed themselves in all their varieties.[1865]\r\nProceeding beyond stocks to dialects, and counting varieties, Ludewig,\r\nin his _Literature of the American Languages_, gave 1,100 different\r\nAmerican languages; but an alphabetical list given by H. W. Bates in\r\nhis _Central America, West Indies and South America_ (London, 1882,\r\n2d ed.)[1866] affords 1,700 names of such. The number, of course,\r\ndepends on how exclusive we are in grouping dialects. Squier, for\r\ninstance, gives only 400 tongues for both North and South America;\r\nfor, as Nadaillac says, “philology has no precise definition of what\r\nconstitutes a language.”[1867]\r\n\r\nThe most comprehensive survey of the bibliography of American\r\nlinguistics, excluding South America, is in Pilling’s _Proof-sheets\r\nof a bibliography of the languages of the North American Indians_\r\n(Washington, 1885), a tentative issue of the Bureau of Ethnology,\r\nalready mentioned. Pilling also earlier catalogued the linguistic\r\nMSS. in the library of the Bureau of Ethnology, in Powell’s _First\r\nReport_ of that Bureau (p. 553), in which that bibliographer also gave\r\na sketch of the history of gathering such collections. A section of\r\nthe _Bibliotheca Americana_ of Charles Leclerc (Paris, 1878) is given\r\nto linguistics, and it affords by groups one of the best keys to the\r\nliterature of the aboriginal languages which we yet have, and it has\r\nbeen supplemented by additional lists issued since by Maisonneuve\r\nof Paris. Ludewig’s _Literature of American Aboriginal Languages,\r\nwith additions by W. Turner_ (London, 1858), was up to date, thirty\r\nyears ago, a good list of grammars and dictionaries, but the increase\r\nhas been considerable in this field since then (Pilling’s _Eskimo\r\nLanguages_, p. 62). The libraries of collectors of Spanish-American\r\nhistory, as enumerated elsewhere,[1868] have usually included much on\r\nthe linguistic history, and the most important of the printed lists\r\nfor Mexico and Central America is that of Brasseur de Bourbourg’s\r\n_Bibliothèque Mexico-Guatémalienne, précédée d’un coup d’œil sur les\r\nétudes américaines dans leurs rapports avec les études classiques, et\r\nsuivi du tableau, par ordre alphabétique, des ouvrages de linguistique\r\naméricaine contenus dans le même volume_ (Paris, 1871). This list is\r\nrepeated with additions in the _Catalogue de Alphonse L. Pinart et ...\r\nde Brasseur de Bourbourg_ (Paris, 1883). Field’s _Indian Bibliography_\r\ncharacterizes some of the leading books up to 1873; but the best source\r\nup to about the same date for a large part of North America is found\r\nin the notes in that section of Bancroft’s _Native Races_, vol. iii.,\r\ngiven to linguistics.[1869] The several _Comptes Rendus_ of the Congrès\r\ndes Américanistes have sections on the same subject, and the second\r\nvolume of the _Contributions to North American Ethnology_, published\r\nby the U. S. Geological Survey (Powell’s), has been kept back for the\r\ncompletion of the linguistic studies of the government officials, which\r\nwill ultimately, under the care of A. S. Gatschet, compose that belated\r\nvolume. Major Powell, in his conduct of ethnological investigations\r\nfor the United States government, has found efficient helpers in James\r\nC. Pilling, J. Owen Dorsey, S. R. Riggs, A. S. Gatschet, not to name\r\nothers. Powell outlined some of his own views in an address on the\r\nevolution of language before the Anthropological Society of Washington,\r\nof which there is an abstract in their _Transactions_ (1881), while the\r\npaper can be found in perfected shape as “The evolution of language\r\nfrom a study of the Indian languages,” in the _First Report of the\r\nBureau of Ethnology_.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest of the students of the native languages in the\r\nnorth were the Catholic missionaries in Canada and in the northwest,\r\nand there is much of interest in their observations as recorded in the\r\n_Jesuit Relations_. We find a _Dictionnaire de la langue huronne_ in\r\nthe _Grand Voyage du Pays des Hurons_ (Paris, 1632, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous of the English publications of the seventeenth\r\ncentury was the Natick rendering of the _Bible_ for the Massachusetts\r\nIndians, undertaken by the Apostle John Eliot, as he was called, at\r\nthe expense of the London Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.\r\nEliot also published a _Grammar of the Massachusetts Indian Language_\r\n(Cambridge, 1666), which, with notes by Peter S. Duponceau and an\r\nintroduction by John Pickering, was printed for the Mass. Hist.\r\nSociety in 1822, as was John Cotton’s _Vocabulary of the Massachusetts\r\nIndian Language_ (Cambridge, 1830). Roger Williams’ _Key into the\r\nlanguage of America_ has been elsewhere referred to.[1870] The Rev.\r\nJonathan Edwards wrote a paper on the language of the Mohegan Indians,\r\nwhich, with annotations by Pickering, was printed in the _Mass. Hist.\r\nSoc. Coll._ in 1823, and is called by Haven (_Archæol. U. S._, 29)\r\nthe earliest exposition of the radical connection of the American\r\nlanguages. Dr. James Hammond Trumbull, the most learned of the students\r\nof these eastern languages, has furnished various papers on them in\r\nthe publications of the American Philological Association and of the\r\nAmerican Antiquarian Society,[1871] and has summarized the literature\r\nof the subject, with references, in the _Memorial Hist. of Boston_\r\n(vol. i.).\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century there were several philological recorders\r\namong the missionaries. Sebastian Rasle made a _Dictionary of the\r\nAbnake Language_, now preserved in MS. in Harvard College library,\r\nwhich, edited by John Pickering, was published as a volume of the\r\n_Memoirs_ of the Amer. Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1833. A\r\ngrammatical sketch of the Abnake as outlined in Rasle’s _Dictionary_\r\nis given by M. C. O’Brien in the _Maine Hist. Soc. Coll._, vol. ix.\r\nThe publications of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia\r\nhave preserved for us the vocabularies and grammars of the Delaware\r\nlanguage, collected and arranged by John Heckewelder[1872] and\r\nDavid Zeisberger, while the latter Moravian missionary collected a\r\nconsiderable MS. store of linguistic traces of the Indian tongues, a\r\npart of which is now preserved in Harvard College library.[1873] One of\r\nthis last collection, an _Indian Dictionary; English, German, Iroquois_\r\n(_the Onondaga_), _and Algonquin_ (_the Delaware_) (Cambridge, 1887,)\r\nhas been carefully edited for the press by Eben Norton Horsford. Dr.\r\nJohn G. Shea published a _Dictionnaire Français-Onontagué, édité\r\nd’après un manuscrit du 17^e siècle_ (N. Y., 1859), which is preserved\r\nin the Mazarin library in Paris.\r\n\r\nThere was no attempt made to treat the study of the American languages\r\nin what would now be termed a scientific spirit by any English\r\nscholar till towards the end of the eighteenth century. The whole\r\nquestion of the origin of the Indians had for a long time been the\r\nsubject of discussion, and it had of necessity taken more or less\r\nof a philological turn from the beginning; but the inquiry had been\r\nsimply a theoretical one, with efforts to substantiate preconceived\r\nbeliefs rather than to formulate inductive ones, as in such works\r\nas—not to name others—Adair’s _American Indians_ (London, 1775), where\r\nevery trace was referable to the Jews, and Count de Gebelin’s _Monde\r\nPrimitif_ (Paris, 1781), where a comparison of American and European\r\nvocabularies is given.[1874]\r\n\r\nA much closer student appeared in Benjamin Smith Barton, of\r\nPhiladelphia, though he was not wholly emancipated from these same\r\nprevalent notions of connecting the Indian tongues with the old-world\r\nspeeches. He says that he was instigated to the study by Pallas’\r\n_Linguarum totius orbis Vocabularia comparativa_ (Petropolis, 1786,\r\n1789), and the result was his _New View of the Origin of the tribes\r\nand nations of America_ (Philad., 1797; again, 1798). He sets forth\r\nin his introduction his methods of study. Charlevoix had suggested\r\nthat the linguistic test was the only one in studying the ethnological\r\nconnections of these peoples; but Barton asserted that there were other\r\nmanifestations, equally important, like the physical aspects, the\r\nmodes of worship, and the myths. He examined forty different Indian\r\nlanguages, and thinks they show a common origin, and that remotely a\r\nconnection existed between the old and new continents.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent American student[1875] of this field in the early half\r\nof this century was Albert Gallatin. He began his observations in 1823,\r\nat the instance of Humboldt, and two years later he took advantage of a\r\nrepresentative convocation of Indian tribes, then held in Washington,\r\nto continue his studies of their speech. In 81 tribes brought under his\r\nnotice he found what he thought to be 27 or 28 linguistic families.\r\nThis was a wider survey than had before been made, and he regretted\r\nthat he was not privileged to profit by the vocabularies collected by\r\nLewis and Clark, which had unfortunately been lost. At the request of\r\nthe Amer. Antiquarian Society, he wrote out and enlarged this study in\r\nthe second volume of their _Collections_ in 1836, and advanced views\r\nthat he never materially changed, believing in a very remote Asiatic\r\norigin of the tongues, and without excepting the Eskimos from his\r\nconclusions. In 1845, in his _Notes on the semi-civilized nations of\r\nMexico_, his conclusions were much the same, but he made an exception\r\nin favor of the Otomis. At this time he counted more than a hundred\r\nlanguages, similar in structure but different in vocabularies, and he\r\nargued that a very long period was necessary thus to differentiate the\r\ntongues. At the age of eighty-seven Gallatin gave his final results in\r\nvol. ii. of the _Transactions of the American Ethnological Society_\r\n(1848). Gallatin published a review[1876] of the volume on Ethnography\r\nand Philology, which had been prepared by Horatio Hale as the seventh\r\nvolume of the _Publications of the Wilkes United States Exploring\r\nExpedition_ (1838-42), and Hale himself, then in the beginning of his\r\nreputation as a linguistic scholar,[1877] published some papers of his\r\nown in the same volume of the _Transactions_.[1878]\r\n\r\nThe two Americans who have done more than others, without the aid of\r\nthe government, to organize aboriginal linguistic studies are Dr. John\r\nGilmary Shea of Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Dr. Daniel Garrison Brinton\r\nof Philadelphia. Of _Shea’s Library of American Linguistics_ he has\r\ngiven an account in the _Smithsonian Rept._, 1861.[1879]\r\n\r\nDr. Brinton has set forth the purposes of his linguistic studies in\r\nan address before the Pennsylvania Historical Society, _American\r\nAboriginal Languages and why we should study them_ (Philad., 1885,—from\r\nthe _Pennsylvania Magazine of History_, 1885, p. 15). In starting his\r\n_Library of Aboriginal American Literature_, he announced his purpose\r\nto put within the reach of scholars authentic materials for the study\r\nof the languages and culture of the native races, each work to be\r\nthe production of the native mind, and to be printed in the original\r\ntongue, with a translation and notes, and to have some intrinsic\r\nhistorical or ethnological importance.[1880]\r\n\r\nThe other considerable collections are both French. Alphonse L.\r\nPinart published a _Bibliothèque de linguistique et d’ethnographie\r\nAméricaines_ (Paris and San Francisco, 1875-82).[1881]\r\n\r\nThe publishing house of Maisonneuve et Compagnie of Paris, which has\r\ndone more than any other business firm to advance these studies, has\r\nconducted a _Collection linguistique Américaine_, of much value to\r\nAmerican philologists.[1882]\r\n\r\nOther French studies have attracted attention. Pierre Etienne Duponceau\r\npublished a _Mémoire sur le système grammatical des langues de quelques\r\nnations indiennes de l’Amérique du Nord_ (Paris, 1838).[1883] He\r\nconducted a correspondence with the Rev. John Heckewelder respecting\r\nthe American tongues, which is published in the _Transactions of\r\nthe Amer. Philosophical Society_ (Phil., 1819), and he translated\r\nZeisberger’s _Delaware Grammar_.\r\n\r\nThe studies of the Abbé Jean André Cuoq have been upon the Algonquin\r\ndialects,[1884] and published mainly in the _Actes de la Société\r\nphilologique_ (Paris, 1869 and later). His monographic _Etudes\r\nphilologiques sur quelques langues sauvages de l’Amérique_ was printed\r\nat Montreal, 1866. It was the result of twenty years’ missionary work\r\namong the Iroquois and Algonquins, and besides a grammar contains a\r\ncritical examination of the works of Duponceau and Schoolcraft. Lucien\r\nAdam has been very comprehensive in his researches, his studies being\r\ncollected under the titles of _Etudes sur six langues Américaines_\r\n(Paris, 1878) and _Examen grammatical comparé de seize langues\r\nAméricaines_ (Paris, 1878).[1885]\r\n\r\nThe papers of the Count Hyacinthe de Charencey have been in the first\r\ninstance for the most part printed in the _Revue de Linguistique_, the\r\n_Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne_, and the _Mémoires de l’Académie de\r\nCaen_, and have wholly pertained to the tongues south of New Mexico;\r\nbut his principal studies are collected in his _Mélanges de philologie\r\net de paléographie Américaines_ (Paris, 1883).[1886]\r\n\r\nThe most distinguished German worker in this field, if we except the\r\nincidental labors of Alexander and William von Humboldt,[1887] is J. C.\r\nE. Buschmann, whose various linguistic labors cover the wide field of\r\nthe west coast of North America from Alaska to the Isthmus, with some\r\nof the regions adjacent on the east. He published his papers in Berlin\r\nbetween 1853 and 1864, and many of them in the _Mémoires de l’Académie\r\nde Berlin_.[1888]\r\n\r\nDr. Carl Hermann Berendt has published his papers in Spanish, English,\r\nand German, and some of them will be found in the _Smithsonian\r\nReports_, in the Berlin _Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_, and in the\r\n_Revista de Mérida_. Under the auspices of the American Ethnological\r\nSociety, a fac-simile reproduction of his graphic _Analytical Alphabet\r\nfor the Mexican and Central American languages_ was published in 1869,\r\nthe result of twelve years’ study in those countries.[1889]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe languages of what are called the civilized nations of the central\r\nregions of America deserve more particular attention.\r\n\r\nIn the Mexican empire the Aztec was largely predominant, but not\r\nexclusively spoken, for about twenty other tongues were more or less\r\nin vogue in different parts. Humboldt and others have found occasional\r\ntraces in words of an earlier language than the Aztec or Nahua, but\r\ndifferent from the Maya, which in Brasseur’s opinion was the language\r\nof the country in those pre-Nahua days. Bancroft, contrary to some\r\nrecent philologists, holds the speech of the Toltec, Chichimec, and\r\nAztec times to be one and the same.[1890] It was perhaps the most\r\ncopious and most perfected of all the aboriginal tongues; and in\r\nproof of this are cited the opinions of the early Spanish scholars,\r\nthe successes of the missionaries in the use of it in imparting the\r\nsubtleties of their faith, and the literary use which was made of it by\r\nthe native scholars, as soon as they had adapted the Roman alphabet to\r\nits vocabulary and forms.[1891]\r\n\r\nThe Maya has much the same prominence farther south that the Nahua has\r\nin the northerly parts of the territory of the Spanish conquest, and a\r\ndialect of it, the Tzendal, still spoken near Palenqué, is considered\r\nto be the oldest form of it, though probably this dialect was a\r\ndeparture from the original stock. It is one of the evidences that the\r\nearly Mayas may have come by way of the West India islands that modern\r\nphilologists say the native tongues of those islands were allied to\r\nthe Maya. Bancroft (iii. 759, with other references, 760) refers to\r\nthe list of spoken tongues given in Palacio’s _Carta al Rey de España_\r\n(1576) as the best enumeration of the early Spanish writers.[1892] For\r\nits literary value we must consult some of the authorities like Orozco\r\ny Berra, mentioned in connection with the Aztec. Squier published a\r\n_Monograph of authors who have written on the languages of Central\r\nAmerica, and collected vocabularies and composed works in the native\r\ndialects of that country_ (Albany, 1861,—100 copies), in which he\r\nmentions 110 such authors, and gives a list of their printed and MS.\r\nworks. Those who have used these native tongues for written productions\r\nare named in Ludewig’s _Literature of the Amer. Aborig. Languages_\r\n(London, 1858) and in Brinton’s _Aboriginal American Authors_ (Phila.,\r\n1883).[1893]\r\n\r\nThe philology of the South American peoples has not been so\r\nwell compassed as that of the northern continent. The classified\r\nbibliographies show the range of it under such heads as Ande (or\r\nCampa), Araucanians (Chilena), Arrawak, Aymara, Brazil (the principal\r\nwork being F. P. von Martius’s _Beiträge zur Ethnographie und\r\nSprachenkunde Amerika’s, zumal Brasiliens_, Leipzig, 1867, with a\r\nsecond part called _Glossaria linguarum brasiliensium, Erlangen_,\r\n1863), Chama, Chibcha (or Muysca, Mosca), Cumanagota, Galibi, Goajira,\r\nGuarani, Kiriri (Kariri), Lule, Moxa, Paez, Quichua, Tehuelhet,\r\nTonocote, Tupi, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES ON THE MYTHS AND RELIGIONS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n_By the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE earliest scholarly examination of the whole subject, which has been\r\nproduced by an American author, is Daniel G. Brinton’s _Myths of the\r\nNew World, a treatise on the symbolism and mythology of the Red Race\r\nof America_ (N. Y., 1868; 2d ed., 1876). It is a comparative study,\r\n“more for the thoughtful general reader than for the antiquary,” as\r\nthe author says. “The task,” he adds, “bristles with difficulties.\r\nCarelessness, prepossessions, and ignorance have disfigured the subject\r\nwith false colors and foreign additions without number” (p. 3).\r\nAfter describing the character of the written, graphic, or symbolic\r\nrecords, which the student of history has to deal with in tracing North\r\nAmerican history back before the Conquest, he adds, while he deprives\r\nmythology of any historical value, that the myths, being kept fresh\r\nby repetition, were also nourished constantly by the manifestations\r\nof nature, which gave them birth. So while taking issue with those\r\nwho find history buried in the myths, he warns us to remember that\r\nthe American myths are not the reflections of history or heroes.\r\nIn the treatment of his subject he considers the whole aboriginal\r\npeople of America as a unit, with “its religion as the development\r\nof ideas common to all its members, and its myths as the garb thrown\r\naround those ideas by imaginations more or less fertile; but seeking\r\neverywhere to embody the same notions.”[1894] This unity of the\r\nAmerican races is far from the opinion of other ethnologists.\r\n\r\nBrinton gives a long bibliographical note on those who had written on\r\nthe subject before him, in which he puts, as the first (1819) to take a\r\nphilosophical survey, Dr. Samuel Farmer Jarvis in a _Discourse on the\r\nreligion of the Indian tribes of North America_, printed in the _N. Y.\r\nHist. Soc. Collections, iii._ (1821). Jarvis confined himself to the\r\ntribes north of Mexico, and considered their condition, as he found\r\nit, one of deterioration from something formerly higher. There had\r\nbeen, of course, before this, amassers of material, like the Jesuits in\r\nCanada, as preserved in their _Relations_,[1895] sundry early French\r\nwriters on the Indians,[1896] the English agents of the Society for the\r\nPropagation of the Gospel in New England, and the Moravian missionaries\r\nin Pennsylvania and the Ohio country, to say nothing of the historians,\r\nlike Loskiel (_Geschichte der Mission_, 1789), Vetromile (_Abnakis and\r\ntheir History_, New York, 1866), Cusick (_Six Nations_), not to mention\r\nlocal observers, like Col. Benjamin Hawkins, _Sketch of the Creek\r\nCountry (Georgia Hist. Soc. Collections_, 1848, but written about 1800).\r\n\r\nIf the placing of Brinton’s book as the earliest scholarly\r\ncontribution is to be contested, it would be for E. G. Squier’s\r\n_Serpent Symbol in America_ (N. Y., 1851);[1897] but the book is not\r\nbroadly based, except so far as such comprehensiveness can be deduced\r\nfrom his tendency to consider all myths as having some force of nature\r\nfor their motive, and that all are traceable to an instinct that\r\nmakes the worship of fire or of the sun the centre of a system.[1898]\r\nWith this as the source of life, Squier allies the widespread phallic\r\nworship. In Bancroft’s _Native Races_ (iii. p. 501) there is a summary\r\nof what is known of this American worship of the generative power.\r\nBrinton doubts (_Myths_, etc., 149) if anything like phallic worship\r\nreally existed, apart from a wholly unreligious surrender to appetite.\r\n\r\nAnother view which Squier maintains is, that above all this and\r\npervading all America’s religious views there was a sort of rudimentary\r\nmonotheism.[1899]\r\n\r\nWhen we add to this enumeration the somewhat callow and wholly\r\nunsatisfactory contributions of Schoolcraft in the great work on\r\nthe _Indian Tribes of the United States_ (1851-59), which the U. S.\r\ngovernment in a headlong way sanctioned, we have included nearly all\r\nthat had been done by American authors in this field when Bancroft\r\npublished the third volume of his _Native Races_. This work constitutes\r\nthe best mass of material for the student—who must not confound\r\nmythology and religion—to work with, the subject being presented\r\nunder the successive heads of the origin of myths and of the world,\r\nphysical and animal myths, gods, supernatural beings, worship and\r\nthe future state; but of course, like all Bancroft’s volumes, it\r\nmust be supplemented by special works pertaining to the more central\r\nand easterly parts of the United States, and to the regions south of\r\nPanama. The deficiency, however, is not so much as may be expected\r\nwhen we consider the universality of myths. “Unfortunately,” says this\r\nauthor, “the philologic and mythologic material for such an exhaustive\r\nsynthesis of the origin and relations of the American creeds as Cox has\r\ngiven to the world in the Aryan legends in his _Mythology of the Aryan\r\nNations_ (London, 1870) is yet far from complete.”\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Brinton, after riper study, again recast his views of a leading\r\nfeature of the subject in his _American hero-myths; a study in the\r\nnative religions of the western continent_ (Philad., 1882), in which\r\nhe endeavored to present “in a critically correct light some of the\r\nfundamental conceptions in the native beliefs.” His purpose was to\r\ncounteract what he held to be an erroneous view in the common practice\r\nof considering “American hero-gods as if they had been chiefs of\r\ntribes at some undetermined epoch,” and to show that myths of similar\r\nimport, found among different peoples, were a “spontaneous production\r\nof the mind, and not a reminiscence of an historic event.” He further\r\nadds as one of the impediments in the study that he does “not know\r\nof a single instance on this continent of a thorough and intelligent\r\nstudy of a native religion made by a Protestant missionary.”[1900]\r\nAfter an introductory chapter on the American myths, Brinton in this\r\nvolume takes up successively the consideration of the hero-gods of\r\nthe Algonquins and Iroquois, the Aztecs, Mayas, and the Quichuas of\r\nPeru. These myths of national heroes, civilizers, and teachers are,\r\nas Brinton says, the fundamental beliefs of a very large number of\r\nAmerican tribes, and on their recognition and interpretation depends\r\nthe correct understanding of most of their mythology and religious\r\nlife,—and this means, in Brinton’s view, that the stories connected\r\nwith these heroes have no historic basis.[1901]\r\n\r\nThe best known of the comprehensive studies by a European writer is\r\nJ. G. Müller’s _Geschichte der Amerikanischen Urreligionen_ (Basle,\r\n1855; again in 1867), in which he endeavors to work out the theory that\r\nat the south there is a worship of nature, with a sun-worship for a\r\ncentre, contrasted at the north with fetichism and a dread of spirits,\r\nand these he considers the two fundamental divisions of the Indian\r\nworship. Bancroft finds him a chief dependence at times, but Brinton,\r\ncharging him with quoting in some instances at second-hand, finds him\r\nof no authority whatever.\r\n\r\nOne of the most reputable of the German books on kindred subjects\r\nis the _Anthropologie der Naturvölker_ (Leipzig, 1862-66) of Theodor\r\nWaitz. Brinton’s view of it is that no more comprehensive, sound, and\r\ncritical work on the American aborigines has been written; but he\r\nconsiders him astray on the religious phases, and that his views are\r\nneither new nor tenable when he endeavors to subject moral science to a\r\nrealistic philosophy.[1902]\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the scope of the comprehensive work of H. H. Bancroft we\r\nmentioned that beyond the larger part of the great Athapascan stock of\r\nthe northern Indians his treatment did not extend. Such other general\r\nworks as Brinton’s _Myths of the New World_, the sections of his\r\n_American Hero-Myths_ on the hero-gods of the Algonquins and Iroquois,\r\nand the not wholly satisfactory book of Ellen R. Emerson, _Indian\r\nmyths; or, Legends, traditions, and symbols of the aborigines of\r\nAmerica, compared with those of other countries, including Hindostan,\r\nEgypt, Persia, Assyria, and China_ (Boston, 1884), with aid from such\r\npapers as Major J. W. Powell’s “Philosophy of the North American\r\nIndians” in the _Journal of the Amer. Geographical Society_ (vol. viii.\r\np. 251, 1876), and his “Mythology of the North American Indians” in\r\nthe _First Annual Rept. of the Bureau of Ethnology_ (1881), and R.\r\nM. Dorman’s _Origin of primitive superstition among the aborigines\r\nof America_ (Philad., 1881), must suffice in a general way to cover\r\nthose great ethnic stocks of the more easterly part of North America,\r\nwhich comprise the Iroquois, centred in New York, and surrounded by\r\nthe Algonquins, west of whom were the Dacotas, and south of whom were\r\nthe Creeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws, sometimes classed together as\r\nAppalachians.[1903]\r\n\r\nThe mythology of the Aztecs is the richest mine, and Bancroft in his\r\nthird volume finds the larger part of his space given to the Mexican\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nBrinton (_Amer. Hero Myths_, 73, 78), referring to the “Historia de los\r\nMéxicanos por sus Pinturas” of Ramirez de Fuenleal, as printed in the\r\n_Anales del Museo Nacional_ (ii. p. 86), says that in some respects it\r\nis to be considered the most valuable authority which we possess,[1904]\r\nas taken directly from the sacred books of the Aztecs, and as explained\r\nby the most competent survivors of the Conquest.[1905]\r\n\r\nWe must also look to Ixtlilxochitl and Sahagún as leading sources. From\r\nSahagún we get the prayers which were addressed to the chief deity,\r\nof various names, but known best, perhaps, as Tezcatlipoca; and these\r\ninvocations are translated for us in Bancroft (iii. 199, etc.), who\r\nsupposes that, consciously or unconsciously, Sahagún has slipped into\r\nthem a certain amount of “sophistication and adaptation to Christian\r\nideas.” From the lofty side of Tezcatlipoca’s character, Bancroft\r\n(iii. ch. 7) passes to his meaner characteristics as the oppressor of\r\nQuetzalcoatl.\r\n\r\nThe most salient features of the mythology of the Aztecs arise from\r\nthe long contest of Tezcatlipoca and Quetzalcoatl, the story of which\r\nmodified the religion of their followers, and, as Chavero claims,\r\ngreatly affected their history.[1906] This struggle, according as the\r\ninterpreters incline, stands for some historic or physical rivalry, or\r\nfor one between St. Thomas and the heathen;[1907] but Brinton explains\r\nit on his general principles as one between the powers of Light and\r\nDarkness (_Am. Hero Myths_, 65).\r\n\r\nThe main original sources on the character and career of Quetzalcoatl\r\nare Motolinía, Mendieta, Sahagún, Ixtlilxochitl, and Torquemada, and\r\nthese are all summarized in Bancroft (iii. ch. 7).\r\n\r\nIt has been a question with later writers whether there is a foundation\r\nof history in the legend or myth of Quetzalcoatl. Brinton (_Myths of\r\nthe New World_, 180) has perhaps only a few to agree with him when he\r\ncalls that hero-god a “pure creature of the fancy, and all his alleged\r\nhistory nothing but a myth,” and he thinks some confusion has arisen\r\nfrom the priests of Quetzalcoatl being called by his name.\r\n\r\nBandelier (_Archæol. Tour_) takes issue with Brinton in deeming\r\nQuetzalcoatl on the whole an historical person, whom Ixtlilxochitl\r\nconnects with the pre-Toltec tribes of Olmeca and Xicalanca, and\r\nwhom Torquemada says came in while the Toltecs occupied the country.\r\nBandelier thinks it safe to say that Quetzalcoatl began his career\r\nin the present state of Hidalgo as a leader of a migration moving\r\nsouthward, with a principal sojourn at Cholula, introducing arts and a\r\npurer worship. This is substantially the view taken by J. G. Müller,\r\nPrescott, and Wuttke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUETZALCOATL.\r\n\r\nAfter a drawing in Cumplido’s Mexican ed. of Prescott’s _Mexico_, vol.\r\niii. Images of him are everywhere (Nadaillac, 273-74). Cf. Eng. transl.\r\nof Charnay, p. 87.]\r\n\r\nBancroft (iii. 273) finds the _Geschichte der Amer. Urreligionen_\r\n(p. 577) of Müller to present a more thorough examination of the\r\nQuetzalcoatl myth than any other,[1908] but since then it has been\r\nstudied at length by Bandelier in his _Archæological Tour_ (p. 170\r\netc.), and by Brinton in his _Amer. Hero Myths_, ch. 3.[1909]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat Tylor (_Primitive Culture_, ii. 279) calls “the inexplicable\r\ncompound, parthenogenetic deity, the hideous, gory Huitzilopochtli”\r\n(Huitziloputzli, Vitziliputzli), the god of war,[1910] the protector of\r\nthe Mexicans, was considered by Boturini (_Idea_, p. 60) as a deified\r\nancient war-chief. Bancroft in his narrative (iii. 289, 294; iv. 559)\r\nquotes the accounts in Sahagún and Torquemada, and (pp. 300-322)\r\nsummarizes J. G. Müller’s monograph on this god, which he published in\r\n1847, and which he enlarged when including it in his _Urreligionen_.\r\n\r\nAcosta’s description of the Temple of Huitzilopochtli is translated in\r\nBancroft (iii. 292). Solis follows Acosta, while Herrera copies Gomara,\r\nwho was not, as Solis contends, so well informed.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Votan myth of Chiapas, Brinton tells us something in\r\nhis _American Hero Myths_ (212, with references, 215); but the prime\r\nsource is the Tzendal manuscript used by Cabrera in his _Teatro\r\nCritico-Americano_.[1911] No complete translation has been made, and\r\nthe abstracts are unsatisfactory. Bancroft aids us in this study of\r\nworship in Chiapas (iii. 458), as also in that of Oajaca (iii. 448),\r\nMichoacan[1912] (iii. 445), and Jalisco (iii. 447).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MEXICAN TEMPLE.\r\n\r\nReduced from a drawing in Icazbalceta’s _Coleccion de Documentos_,\r\ni. p. 384. There were two usual forms of the Mexican temple: one of\r\nthis type, and the other with two niche-like pavilions on the top. Cf.\r\ndrawings in Clavigero (Casena, 1780), ii. 26, 34; Eng. tr. by Cullen,\r\ni. 262, 373; Stevens’s Eng. tr. Herrera (London, 1740, vol. ii.).]\r\n\r\n“The religion of the Mayas,” says Bancroft (iii. ch. 11), “was\r\nfundamentally the same as that of the Nahuas, though it differed\r\nsomewhat in outward forms. Most of the gods were deified heroes....\r\nOccasionally we find very distinct traces of an older sun-worship\r\nwhich has succumbed to later forms, introduced according to vague\r\ntradition from Anahuac.” The view of Tylor (_Anahuac_, 191) is that the\r\n“civilization,” and consequently the religions, of Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica were originally independent, but that they came much into\r\ncontact, and thus modified one another to no small extent.”\r\n\r\nModern scholars are not by any means so much inclined as Las Casas and\r\nthe other Catholic fathers were to recognize the dogma of the Trinity\r\nand other Christian notions, which have been thought to be traceable in\r\nwhat the Maya people in their aboriginal condition held for faith.\r\n\r\nThe most popular of their deified heroes were Zamná and Cukulcan, not\r\nunlikely the same personage under two names, and quite likely both\r\nare correspondences of Quetzalcoatl. We can find various views and\r\nalternatives on this point among the elder and recent writers. The\r\nbelief in community of attributes derives its strongest aid from the\r\nalleged disappearance of Quetzalcoatl in Goazacoalco just at the epoch\r\nwhen Cukulcan appeared in Yucatan. The centres of Maya worship were at\r\nIzamal, Chichen-Itza, and the island of Cozumel.\r\n\r\nThe hero-gods of the Mayas is the topic of Brinton’s fourth chapter in\r\nhis _American Hero Myths_, with views of their historical relations of\r\ncourse at variance with those of Bancroft. As respects the material,\r\nhe says that “most unfortunately very meagre sources of information\r\nare open to us. Only fragments of their legends and hints of their\r\nhistory have been saved, almost by accident, from the general wreck of\r\ntheir civilization.” The heroes are Itzamná, the leader of the first\r\nimmigration from the east, through the ocean pathways; and Kukulcan,\r\nthe conductor of the second from the west. For the first cycle of\r\nmyths Brinton refers to Landa’s _Relation_, Cogolludo’s _Yucatan_, Las\r\nCasas’s _Historia Apologética_, involving the reports of the missionary\r\nFrancisco Hernandez, and to Hieronimo Roman’s _De la Republica de las\r\nIndias Occidentales_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TEMPLE OF MEXICO.\r\n\r\nAfter plate (reduced) in Herrera.]\r\n\r\nThe Kukulcan legends are considered by Brinton to be later in date\r\nand less natural in character, and Hernandez’s Report to Las Casas\r\nis the first record of them. Brinton’s theory of the myths does not\r\nallow him to identify the Quetzalcoatl and Kukulcan hero-gods as one\r\nand the same, nor to show that the Aztec and Maya civilizations had\r\nmore correspondence than occasional intercourse would produce; but he\r\nthinks the similarity of the statue of “Chac Mool,” unearthed by Le\r\nPlongeon at Chichen-Itza, to another found at Tlaxcala compels us to\r\nbelieve that some positive connection did exist in parts of the country\r\n(_Anales del Museo Nacional_, i. 270).[1913] “The Nahua impress,”\r\nsays Bancroft (iii. 490), “noticeable in the languages and customs of\r\nNicaragua, is still more strongly marked in the mythology. Instead of\r\nobliterating the older forms of worship, as it seems to have done in\r\nthe northern parts of Central America, it has here and there passed by\r\nmany of the distinct beliefs held by different tribes, and blended with\r\nthe chief elements of a system which is traced to the Muyscas in South\r\nAmerica.”\r\n\r\nThe main source of the Quiché myths and worship is the _Popul Vuh_,\r\nbut Bancroft (iii. 474), who follows it, finds it difficult to make\r\nanything comprehensible out of its confusion of statement. But\r\nprominent among the deities seem to stand Tepeu or Gucumatz, whom it is\r\nthe fashion to make the same with Quetzalcoatl, and Hurakan or Tohil,\r\nwho indeed stands on a plane above Quetzalcoatl. Brinton (_Myths_,\r\n156), on the contrary, connects Hurakan with Tlaloc, and seems to\r\nidentify Tohil with Quetzalcoatl. Bancroft (iii. 477) says that\r\ntradition, name, and attributes connect Tohil and Hurakan, and identify\r\nthem with Tlaloc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEOYAOMIQUI.\r\n\r\nThe idol dug up in the Plaza in Mexico is here presented, after a cut,\r\nfollowing Nebel, in Tylor’s _Anahuac_, showing the Mexican goddess of\r\nwar, or death. Cf. cut in _American Antiquarian_, Jan., 1883; Powell’s\r\n_First Rept. Bur. Ethn._, 232; Bancroft, iv. 512, 513, giving the front\r\nafter Nebel, and the other views after Léon y Gama. Bandelier (_Arch.\r\nTour_, pl. v) gives a photograph of it as it stands in the court-yard\r\nof the Museo Nacional.\r\n\r\nGallatin (_Am. Ethn. Soc. Trans._, i. 338) describes Teoyaomiqui\r\nas the proper companion of Huitzilopochtli: “The symbols of her\r\nattributes are found in the upper part of the statue; but those from\r\nthe waist downwards relate to other deities connected with her or with\r\nHuitzilopochtli.” Tylor (_Anahuac_, 222) says: “The antiquaries think\r\nthat the figures in it stand for different personages, and that it\r\nis three gods: Huitzilopochtli the god of war, Teoyaomiqui his wife,\r\nand Mictlantecutli the god of hell.” Léon y Gama calls the statue\r\nTeoyaomiqui, but Bandelier, _Archæol. Tour_, 67, thinks its proper name\r\nis rather Huitzilopochtli. Léon y Gama’s description is summarized in\r\nBancroft, iii. 399, who cites also what Humboldt (_Vues_, etc., ii.\r\n153, and his pl. xxix) says. Bancroft (iii. 397) speaks of it as “a\r\nhuge compound statue, representing various deities, the most prominent\r\nbeing a certain Teoyaomiqui, who is almost identical with, or at least\r\na connecting link between, the mother goddess” and Mictlantecutli, the\r\ngod of Mictlan, or Hades. Cf. references in Bancroft, iv. 515.]\r\n\r\nBrinton’s _Names of the gods in the Kiché myths, a monograph on Central\r\nAmerican mythology_ (Philad. Am. Philos. Soc., 1881), is a special\r\nstudy of a part of the subject.\r\n\r\nBrinton (_Myths_, etc., 184) considers the best authorities on the\r\nmythology of the Muyscas of the Bogota region to be Piedrahita’s\r\n_Historia de las Conquistas del Nuevo Reyno de Granada_ (1668, followed\r\nby Humboldt in his _Vues_) and Simm’s _Noticias historiales de las\r\nConquistas de Tierra Firme en el Nuevo Reyno de Granada_, given in\r\nKingsborough, vol. viii.\r\n\r\nThe mythology of the Quichuas in Peru makes the staple of chap. 5 of\r\nBrinton’s _Amer. Hero-Myths_. Here the corresponding hero-god was\r\nViracocha. Brinton depends mainly on the _Relacion Anónyma de los\r\nCostumbres Antiguos de los Naturales del Piru, 1615_ (Madrid, 1879);\r\non Christoval de Molina’s account of the fables and religious customs\r\nof the Incas, as translated by C. R. Markham in the Hakluyt Society\r\nvolume, _Narratives of the Rites and Laws of the Yncas_ (London, 1873);\r\non the _Comentarios reales_ of Garcilasso de la Vega; on the report\r\nmade to the viceroy Francisco de Toledo, in 1571, of the responses to\r\ninquiries made in different parts of the country as to the old beliefs\r\nwhich appear in the “Informacion de las idolatras de los Incas é\r\nIndios,” printed in the _Coleccion de documentos ineditos del archivo\r\nde Indias_, xxi. 198; and in the _Relacion de Antigüedades deste Reyno\r\ndel Piru_, by Juan de Santa Cruz Pachicuti.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT TEOCALLI, OAXACA, MEXICO.\r\n\r\nAfter a cut in Squier’s _Serpent Symbol_, p. 78.]\r\n\r\nBrinton dissents to D’Orbigny’s view in his _L’homme Américaine_, that\r\nthe Quichua religion is mainly borrowed from the older mythology of the\r\nAymaras.\r\n\r\nFrancisco de Avila’s “Errors and False Gods of the Indians of\r\nHuarochiri” (1608), edited by Markham for the Hakluyt Society in the\r\nvolume called _Narratives of the Rites and Laws of the Yncas_, is a\r\ntreatment of a part of the subject.\r\n\r\nAdolf Bastian’s _Ein Jahr auf Reisen—Kreuzfahrten zum Sammelbehuf aus\r\nTransatlantischen Feldern der Ethnologie_, being the first volume of\r\nhis _Die Culturländer des Alten America_ (Berlin, 1878), has a section\r\n“Aus Religion and Sitte des Alten Peru.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nARCHÆOLOGICAL MUSEUMS AND PERIODICALS.\r\n\r\n_By the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE oldest of existing American societies dealing with the scientific\r\naspects of knowledge is the American Philosophical Society of\r\nPhiladelphia, whose _Transactions_ began in 1769, and made six volumes\r\nto 1809. A second series was begun in 1818.[1914] What are called\r\nthe _Transactions of the Historical and Literary Committee_ make two\r\nvolumes (1819, 1838), the first of which contains contributions by\r\nHeckewelder and P. S. Duponceau on the history and linguistics of the\r\nLenni Lenape. Its _Proceedings_ began in 1838. The American Academy\r\nof Arts and Sciences was instituted at Boston in 1780, a part of its\r\nobject being “to promote and encourage the knowledge of the antiquities\r\nof America,”[1915] and its series of _Memoirs_ began in 1783,[1916]\r\nand its _Proceedings_ in 1846. These societies have only, as a rule,\r\nincidentally, and not often till of late years, illustrated in their\r\npublications the antiquities of the new world; but the American\r\nAntiquarian Society was founded in 1812 at Worcester, Mass., by Isaiah\r\nThomas, with the express purpose of elucidating this department of\r\nAmerican history. It began the _Archæologia Americana_ in 1820, and\r\nsome of the volumes are still valuable, though they chiefly stand for\r\nthe early development by Atwater, Gallatin, and others of study in this\r\ndirection. In the first volume is an account of the origin and design\r\nof the society, and this is also set forth in the memoir of Thomas\r\nprefixed to its reprint of his _History of Printing in America_, which\r\nis a part of the series. The _Proceedings_ of the society were begun in\r\n1849, and they have contained some valuable papers on Central American\r\nsubjects. The Boston Society of Natural History[1917] published the\r\n_Boston Journal of Natural History_ from 1834 to 1863, and in 1866\r\nbegan its _Memoirs_. Col. Whittlesey gave in its first volume a paper\r\non the weapons and military character of the race of the mounds,\r\nand subsequent volumes have had other papers of an archæological\r\nnature; but they have formed a small part of its contributions. Its\r\n_Proceedings_ have of late years contained some of the best studies of\r\npalæolithic man. The American Ethnological Society, founded by Gallatin\r\n(New York), began its exclusive work in a series of _Transactions_\r\n(1845-53, vols. i., ii., and one number of vol. iii.), but it was\r\nnot of long continuance, though it embraced among its contributors\r\nthe conspicuous names of Gallatin, Schoolcraft, Catherwood, Squier,\r\nRafn, S. G. Morton, J. R. Bartlett, and others. Its _Bulletin_ was\r\nnot continued beyond a single volume (1860-61).[1918] The society was\r\nsuspended in 1871.\r\n\r\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science began its\r\npublications with the _Proceedings_ of its Philadelphia meeting in\r\n1848. Questions of archæology formed, however, but a small portion of\r\nits inquiries[1919] till the formation of a section on Anthropology a\r\nfew years ago.\r\n\r\nThe American Geographical Society has published a _Bulletin_\r\n(1852-56); _Journal_ (or _Transactions_) (1859), etc., and\r\n_Proceedings_ (1862-64). Some of the papers have been of archæological\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe Anthropological Institute of New York printed its transactions in a\r\n_Journal_ (one vol. only, 1872-73).\r\n\r\nThe Archæological Institute of America was founded in Boston in 1879,\r\nand has given the larger part of its interest to classical archæology.\r\nThe first report of its executive committee said respecting the field\r\nin the new world: “The study of American archæology relates, indeed,\r\nto the monuments of a race that never attained to a high degree of\r\ncivilization, and that has left no trustworthy records of continuous\r\nhistory.... From what it was and what it did, nothing is to be\r\nlearned that has any direct bearing on the progress of civilization.\r\nSuch interest as attaches to it is that which it possesses in common\r\nwith other early and undeveloped races of mankind.” Appended to this\r\nreport was Lewis H. Morgan’s “Houses of the American Aborigines,\r\nwith suggestions for the exploration of the ruins in New Mexico,”\r\netc.,—advancing his well-known views of the communal origin of the\r\nsouthern ruins. Under the auspices of the Institute, Mr. A. F.\r\nBandelier, a disciple of Morgan, was sent to New Mexico for the\r\nstudy of the Pueblos, and his experiences are described in the\r\nsecond _Report_ of the Institute. In their third _Report_ (1882) the\r\ncommittee of the Institute say: “The vast work of American archæology\r\nand anthropology is only begun.... Other nations, with more or less\r\nof success, are trying to do our work on our soil. It is time that\r\nAmericans bestir themselves in earnest upon a field which it would\r\nbe a shame to abandon to the foreigner.” Still under the pay of the\r\nInstitute, Mr. Bandelier, in 1881, devoted his studies to the remains\r\nat Mexico, Cholula, Mitla, and the ancient life of those regions. At\r\nthe same time, Aymé, then American consul at Merida, was commissioned\r\nto explore certain regions of Yucatan, but the results were not\r\nfortunate.\r\n\r\nThe Institute began in 1881 the publication of an _American Series_ of\r\nits _Papers_, the first number of which embodied Bandelier’s studies\r\nof the Pueblos, and the second covered his Mexican researches. In 1885\r\nthe _American Journal of Archæology_ was started at Baltimore as the\r\nofficial organ of the Institute, and occasional papers on American\r\nsubjects have been given in its pages. The editors were called upon\r\nto define more particularly their relations to archæology in America\r\nin the number for Sept., 1888. In this they say: “The archæology of\r\nAmerica is busied with the life and work of a race or races of men in\r\nan inchoate, rudimentary, and unformed condition, who never raised\r\nthemselves, even at their highest point, as in Mexico and Peru,\r\nabove a low stage of civilization, and never showed the capacity of\r\nsteadily progressive development.... These facts limit and lower the\r\ninterest which attaches ... to crude and imperfect human life.... A\r\ncomparison of their modes of life and thought with those of other races\r\nin a similar stage of development in other parts of the world, in\r\nancient and modern times, is full of interest as exhibiting the close\r\nsimilarity of primitive man in all regions, resulting from the sameness\r\nof his first needs, in his early struggle for existence.” The editors\r\nrest their reasons for giving prominence to classical archæology upon\r\nthe necessity of affording by such complemental studies the means of\r\ncomparison in archæological results, which can but advance to a higher\r\nplane the methods and inductions of the prehistoric archæology of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe American Folk-Lore Society was founded in Jan., 1888, and _The\r\nJournal of American Folk-Lore_ was immediately begun. A large share\r\nof its papers is likely to cover the popular tales of the American\r\naborigines.\r\n\r\nThe Anthropological Society of Washington is favorably situated to\r\navail itself of the museums and apparatus of the American government,\r\nand members of the Geological Survey and Ethnological Bureau have\r\nbeen among the chief contributors to its _Transactions_,[1920] which\r\nin January, 1888, were merged in a more general publication, _The\r\nAmerican Anthropologist_. A National Geographic Society was organized\r\nin Washington in 1888.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous local societies throughout the United States whose\r\npurpose, more or less, is to cover questions of archæological import.\r\nThose that existed prior to 1876 are enumerated in Scudder’s _Catalogue\r\nof Scientific Serials_; but it was not easy always to draw the line\r\nbetween historical associations and those verging upon archæological\r\nmethods.[1921]\r\n\r\nThe oldest of the scientific periodicals in the United States to\r\ndevote space to questions of anthropology is Silliman’s _American\r\nJournal of Science and Arts_ (1818, etc.). The _American Naturalist_,\r\nfounded in 1867, also entered the field of archæology and anthropology.\r\nThe same may be said in some degree of the _Popular Science Monthly_\r\n(1877, etc.), _Science_ (1883), and the _Kansas City Review_. The chief\r\nrepository of such contributions, however, since 1878, has been _The\r\nAmerican Antiquarian_ (Chicago), edited by Stephen D. Peet. Its papers\r\nare, unluckily, of very uneven value.[1922]\r\n\r\nThe best organized work has been done in the United States by the\r\nPeabody Museum of American Archæology and Ethnology, in Cambridge,\r\nMass., and by certain departments of the Federal government at\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe Peabody Museum resulted from a gift of George Peabody, an American\r\nbanker living in London, who instituted it in 1866 as a part of Harvard\r\nUniversity.[1923] It was fortunate in its first curator, Dr. Jeffries\r\nWyman, who brought unusual powers of comprehensive scrutiny to its\r\nwork.[1924] He died in 1874, and was succeeded by one of his and of\r\nAgassiz’s pupils, Frederick W. Putnam, who was also placed in the chair\r\nof archæology in the university in 1886. The _Reports_, now twenty-two\r\nin number, and the new series of _Special Papers_ are among the best\r\nrecords of progress in archæological science.\r\n\r\nThe creation of the Smithsonian Institution in 1846, under the bequest\r\nof an Englishman, James Smithson, and the devotion of a sum of about\r\n$31,000 a year at that time arising from that gift, first put the\r\ngovernment of the United States in a position “to increase and diffuse\r\nknowledge among men.”[1925]\r\n\r\nThe second _Report_ of the Regents in 1848 contains approvals of a\r\nmanuscript by E. G. Squier and E. H. Davis, which had been offered to\r\nthe Institution for publication, and which had been commended by Albert\r\nGallatin, Edward Robinson, John Russell Bartlett, W. W. Turner, S. G.\r\nMorton, and George P. Marsh. Thus an important archæological treatise,\r\n_The Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, comprising the\r\nresults of extensive original surveys and explorations_ (Washington,\r\n1848), became the first of the _Smithsonian Contributions to\r\nKnowledge_. The subsequent volumes of the series have contained other\r\nimportant treatises in similar fields. Foremost among them may be\r\nnamed those of Squier on the Aboriginal Monuments of New York (vol.\r\nii., 1851); Col. Whittlesey on _The Ancient Works in Ohio_ (vol. iii.,\r\n1852); S. R. Riggs’ _Dakota Grammar and Dictionary_ (vol. iv., 1852);\r\nI. A. Lapham’s _Antiquities of Wisconsin_ (vol. vii., 1855); S. F.\r\nHaven’s _Archæology of the United States_ (vol. viii., 1856); Brantz\r\nMayer’s _Mexican History and Archæology_ (vol. ix., 1857); Whittlesey\r\non _Ancient Mining on Lake Superior_ (vol. xiii., 1863); Morgan’s\r\n_Systems of Consanguinity of the human family_ (vol. xvii., 1871);—not\r\nto name lesser papers. To supplement this quarto series, another in\r\noctavo was begun in 1862, called _Miscellaneous Collections_; and in\r\nthis form there have appeared J. M. Stanley’s _Catalogue of portraits\r\nof No. Amer. Indians_ (vol. ii., 1862); a _Catalogue of photographic\r\nportraits of the No. Amer. Indians_ (vol. xiv., 1878).\r\n\r\nOf much more interest to the anthropologist has been the series of\r\n_Annual Reports_ with their appended papers,—such as Squier on _The\r\nAntiquities of Nicaragua_ (1851); W. W. Turner on _Indian Philology_\r\n(1852); S. S. Lyon on _Antiquities from Kentucky_ (1858), and many\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe sections of correspondence and minor papers in these reports soon\r\nbegan to include communications about the development of archæological\r\nresearch in various localities. They began to be more orderly arranged\r\nunder the sub-heading of Ethnology in the Report for 1867, and this\r\nheading was changed to Anthropology in the _Report_ for 1879. Charles\r\nRau (d. 1887) had been a leading contributor in this department, and\r\nno. 440 of the Smithsonian publications was made up of his _Articles on\r\nAnthropological Subjects, contributed from 1863 to 1877_ (Washington,\r\n1882). No. 421 is Geo. H. Boehmer’s _Index to Anthropological Articles\r\nin the publications of the Smithsonian Institution_ (Washington, 1881).\r\nAmong the later papers those of O. T. Mason of the Anthropological\r\nDepartment of the National Museum are conspicuous.\r\n\r\nThe last series is the _Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology_, placed by\r\nCongress in the charge of the Smithsonian. The _Reports of the American\r\nHistorical Association_ will soon be begun under the same auspices.\r\n\r\nMajor J. W. Powell, the director of the Bureau of Ethnology, said that\r\nits purpose was “to organize anthropologic research in America.”[1926]\r\nIt published its first report in 1881, and this and the later reports\r\nhave had for contents, beside the summary of work constituting the\r\nformal report, the following papers:—\r\n\r\nVol. i.: J. W. POWELL. The evolution of language.—Sketch of the\r\nmythology of the North American Indians.—Wyandot government.—On\r\nlimitations to the use of some anthropologic data.—H. C.

The religious\r\nlife of the Zuñi child.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the United States National Museum is also in charge of\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution,[1927] and here are deposited the objects\r\nof archæological and historical interest secured by the government\r\nexplorations and by other means. The linguistic material is kept\r\nin the Bureau of Ethnology. The skulls and physiological material,\r\nillustrative of prehistoric times, are deposited in the Army Medical\r\nMuseum, under the Surgeon-General’s charge.\r\n\r\nMajor Powell, while in charge of the Geographical and Geological Survey\r\nof the Rocky Mountain Region, had earlier prepared five volumes of\r\n_Contributions to Ethnology_, all but the second of which have been\r\npublished. The first volume (1877) contained W. H. Dall’s “Tribes of\r\nthe Extreme Northwest” and George Gibbs’ “Tribes of Western Washington\r\nand Northwestern Oregon.” The third (1877): Stephen Powers’ “Tribes\r\nof California.” The fourth (1881): Lewis H. Morgan’s “Houses and\r\nhouse life of the American Aborigines.” The fifth (1882): Charles\r\nRau’s “Lapidarian sculpture of the Old World and in America,” Robert\r\nFletcher’s “Prehistoric trephining and cranial Amulets,” and Cyrus\r\nThomas on the Troano Manuscript, with an introduction by D. G. Brinton.\r\n\r\nAmong the _Reports_ of the geographical and geological explorations\r\nand surveys west of the 100th meridian conducted by Capt. Geo. M.\r\nWheeler, the seventh volume, _Report on Archæological and Ethnological\r\nCollections from the vicinity of Santa Barbara, California, and from\r\nruined pueblos of Arizona and New Mexico and certain Interior Tribes_\r\n(Washington, 1879), was edited by F. W. Putnam, and contains papers\r\non the ethnology of Southern California, wood and stone implements,\r\nsculptures, musical instruments, beads, etc.; the Pueblos of New\r\nMexico, their inhabitants, architecture, customs, cliff houses and\r\nother ruins, skeletons, etc.; with an _Appendix_ on Linguistics,\r\ncontaining forty Vocabularies of Pueblo and other Western Indian\r\nLanguages and their classification into seven families.\r\n\r\nThe _Reports_ of the Geological and Geographical Survey of the\r\nTerritories, under the charge of F. V. Hayden, brought to us in those\r\nof 1874-76 the knowledge of the cliff-dwellers, and they contain among\r\nthe miscellaneous publications such papers as W. Matthews’ _Ethnography\r\nand Philology of the Hidatsa Indians_ and W. H. Jackson’s _Descriptive\r\nCatalogue of photographs of No. Amer. Indians_.\r\n\r\nThere are other governmental documents to be noted: _The Exploration\r\nof the Red River of Louisiana in 1852_, by R. B. Marcy and G. B.\r\nMcClellan (Washington, 1854), contains a vocabulary of the Comanches\r\nand Witchitas, with some general remarks by W. W. Turner. There is help\r\nto be derived from the geographical details, and from something on\r\nethnology, in the _Reports of Explorations and Surveys for a Railroad\r\nfrom the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean_ (Washington, 1856-60,\r\nin 12 vols.); in W. H. Emory’s _Report on the United States and Mexican\r\nBoundary Survey_ (Washington, 1857-58, in 2 vols.); J. H. Simpson’s\r\n_Report of Explorations across the great basin of the territory of Utah\r\nin 1859_ (Washington, 1876); J. N. Macomb’s _Report of the Exploring\r\nExpedition from Santa Fé to the Junction of the Grand and Green Rivers\r\nof the Great Colorado of the West in 1859_ (Washington, 1876).\r\n\r\nThere were also published, under the auspices of the government,\r\nthe conglomerate and very unequal work of Henry R. Schoolcraft,\r\n_Historical and Statistical Information respecting the history,\r\nconditions, and prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United\r\nStates, collected and prepared under the direction of the Bureau\r\nof Indian Affairs_ (Philad., 1851-57, in 6 vols., with a trade\r\nedition of the same date). An act of Congress (March 3, 1847)\r\nauthorized its publication. As reissued it is called _Archives\r\nof aboriginal knowledge, containing original papers laid before\r\nCongress, respecting the Indian tribes of the United States_\r\n(Philadelphia, 1860, ’68, 6 vols.). It has the following divisions:\r\nGeneral history.—Manners and customs.—Antiquities.—Geography.—Tribal\r\norganization, etc.—Intellectual capacity.—Topical history.—Physical\r\ntype.—Language.—Art.—Religion and mythology.—Demonology, magic,\r\netc.—Medical knowledge.—Condition and prospects.—Statistics and\r\npopulation.—Biography.—Literature.—Post-Columbian history.—Economy and\r\nstatistics. An edition of vols. 1-5 (1856) is called _Ethnological\r\nresearches respecting the Red Men of America, Information respecting\r\nthe history_, etc. The sixth volume is in effect a summary of the\r\npreceding five.[1928]\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of\r\nScience, a committee was charged with preparing a memorial to Congress,\r\nurging action to insure the preservation of certain national monuments.\r\nThere is a summary of their report in _Science_, xii. p. 101.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf all European countries, the most has been done in France, by way of\r\nperiodical system and corporate organizations, to advance the study\r\nof American anthropology, ethnology, and archæology. The _Annales des\r\nvoyages, de la géographie et de l’histoire, traduits de toutes les\r\nlangues Européennes; des relations originales, inédites_,[1929] the\r\npublication of which was begun by Malte-Brun in 1808 and continued\r\nto 1814, and the _Nouvelles Annales des Voyages_, begun in 1819\r\nand continued with a slightly varying title till 1870, are sources\r\noccasionally of much importance. At a later day, Edouard Lartet and\r\nothers have used the _Annales des Sciences Naturelles_ as a medium\r\nfor their publications. We hardly trace here, however, any corporate\r\nmovement before the institution of the Société de Géographie de Paris\r\nin 1820. In 1824 it issued the first volume of its _Recueil de Voyages\r\net de Mémoires_, which reached seven volumes in 1864, and had included\r\n(vol. ii.) an account of Palenqué and the researches of Warden on the\r\nantiquities of the United States. Since this society began the issue\r\nof its _Bulletin_ in 1827, it has occasionally given assistance in the\r\nstudy of American archæology.\r\n\r\nThe earliest distinctive periodical on the subject was the _Revue\r\nAméricaine_, of which, in 1826-27, three volumes, in monthly parts,\r\nwere published in Paris.[1930] In 1857 a movement was inaugurated\r\nwhich engaged first and last the coöperation of some eminent scholars\r\nin these studies, like Aubin, Buschmann, V. A. Malte-Brun, Abbé\r\nBrasseur de Bourbourg, Jomard, Alphonse Pinart, Cortambert, Léon de\r\nRosny, Waldeck, Abbé Domenech, Charencey, etc. The active movers were\r\nfirst known as the Comité d’Archéologie Américaine, and they issued\r\nan _Annuaire_ (1863-67) and one volume, at least, of _Actes_ (1865),\r\nas well as a collection of _Mémoires sur l’archéologie Américaine_\r\n(1865). This organization soon became known as the Société Américaine\r\nde France, and under the auspices of this name there has been a series\r\nof publications of varying designation.[1931] Its _Annuaire_ began\r\nin 1868, and has been continued. The general name of _Archives de la\r\nSociété Américaine de France_ covers its other publications, which\r\nmore or less coincide with the _Revue Orientale et Américaine par Léon\r\nde Rosny_, the first series of which appeared in Paris in 10 vols.,\r\nin 1859-65, followed by a second, the first volume of which (vol. xi.\r\nof the whole) is called _Revue Américaine, publié sous les auspices\r\nde la Société d’Ethnographie et du Comité d’Archéologie Américaine_,\r\nand is at the same time the fourth volume of the _Actes de la Société\r\nd’Ethnographie Américaine et Orientale_. The whole series is sometimes\r\ncited as the _Mémoires de la Société d’Ethnographie_.[1932] The\r\nseries, already referred to, of the _Archives de la Soc. Amér. de\r\nFrance_ is made up thus: Première série: vol. i., _Revue Orientale et\r\nAméricaine_; ii., _Revue Américaine_; iii. and iv., _Revue Orientale et\r\nAméricaine_.[1933] The nouvelle série has no sub-titles, and the three\r\nvolumes bear date 1875, 1876, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe student of comparative anthropology will resort to the _Materiaux\r\npour l’histoire positive et philosophique_ (later _primitive et\r\nnaturelle_) _de l’homme_, the publication of which was begun at Paris\r\nin 1864 by Gabriel de Mortillet, and has been continued by Trutot,\r\nCartailhac, Chautre, and others. This publication has contained\r\nabstracts of the proceedings of an annual gathering in Paris, whose\r\n_Comptes rendu_ have been printed at length as of the _Congrès\r\ninternational d’anthropologie et d’archéologie préhistoriques_ (1865,\r\netc.).[1934]\r\n\r\nLéon de Rosny published but a single volume of a projected series,\r\n_Archives paléographiques de l’Orient et de l’Amérique_ (Paris,\r\n1870-71), which contains some papers on Mexican picture-writing. Rosny\r\nand others, who had been active in the movement begun by the Comité\r\nd’Archéologie Américaine, were now instrumental in organizing the\r\nperiodical gathering in different cities of Europe, which is known\r\nas the _Congrès international des Américanistes_. The first session\r\nwas held at Nancy in 1875, and its _Compte Rendu_ was published\r\nin two volumes (Nancy and Paris, 1876). The second meeting was at\r\nLuxembourg in 1877 (_Compte Rendu_, Paris, 1878, in 2 vols.); the third\r\nat Brussels in 1879 (_Compte Rendu_); the fourth at Madrid in 1881\r\n(_Congreso internacional de Américanistas. Cuarta reunion_, Madrid,\r\n1881); the fifth at Copenhagen (_Compte Rendu_, Copenhagen, 1884); and\r\nothers at Chalons-sur-Marne, Turin, and Berlin. The papers are printed\r\nin the language in which they were read.\r\n\r\nThe _Mémoires de la Société d’Ethnographie_ (founded in 1859) began\r\nto appear in 1881, and its third volume (1882) is entitled _Les\r\nDocuments écrits de l’Antiquité Américaine, compte rendu d’une mission\r\nscientifique en Espagne et en Portugal, par Léon de Rosny, avec une\r\ncarte et 10 planches_. The fourth volume is P. de Lucy-Fossarieu’s\r\n_Ethnographie de l’Amérique Antarctique_ (Paris, 1884). In the second\r\nvolume of a new series there is an account by V. Devaux of the work in\r\nAmerican ethnology done by Lucien de Rosny as a preface to a posthumous\r\nwork[1935] of Lucien de Rosny, _Les Antilles, étude d’Ethnographie et\r\nd’Archéologique Américaines_ (Paris, 1886).\r\n\r\nLatterly there has been a consolidation of interests among kindred\r\nsocieties under the name of Institution Ethnographique, whose initial\r\n_Rapport annuel sur les récompenses et encouragements décernés en 1883_\r\nwas published at Paris in 1883. This society now comprises the Société\r\nd’Ethnographie, Société Américaine de France, Athénée Oriental, and\r\nSociété des Etudes Japonaises.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn England, organized efforts for the record of knowledge began with\r\nthe creation of the Royal Society, though certain sporadic attempts\r\nhad earlier been known. America was represented among its founders\r\nin the younger John Winthrop, and Cotton Mather was a contributor\r\nto its transactions, and there has occasionally been a paper in its\r\npublications of interest to American archæologists.[1936] The Society\r\nof Antiquaries began to print its _Archæologia_ in 1779 and its\r\n_Proceedings_ in 1848, and the American student finds some valuable\r\npapers in them. The British Association for the Advancement of Science\r\nbegan its _Reports_ with the meeting of 1831, and it has had among its\r\ndivisions a section of anthropology. In 1830 the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety began its _Journal_ with a preliminary issue (1830-31, in\r\n2 vols.), though its regular series first came out in 1832. Its\r\n_Proceedings_ appeared in 1855, and both publications are a conspicuous\r\nsource in many ways relating to early American history.[1937] Closely\r\nconnected with its interest has been the publication begun under the\r\nediting of C. R. Markham, and called successively _Ocean Highways_\r\n(1869-73, vol. i.-v.), with an added title of _Geographical Review_\r\n(1873-74), and lastly as _The Geographical Magazine_ (vol. i.-iii.,\r\n1874-76).\r\n\r\nThe Ethnological Society published four volumes of a _Journal_[1938]\r\nbetween 1844 and 1856, and resuming published two more volumes in\r\n1869-70. Its contents are mainly of interest in comparative study,\r\nthough there are a few American papers, like D. Forbes’s on the Aymara\r\nIndians of Peru. This society’s _Transactions_ was issued in two\r\nvolumes, 1859-60; and again in seven volumes, 1861-69.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, some gentlemen, not content with the restricted field of\r\nthe Ethnological Society, founded in London an Anthropological Society,\r\nwhich began the publication of _Memoirs_ (1863-69, in 3 vols.); and in\r\nthis publication Bollaert issued his papers on the population of the\r\nnew world, on the astronomy of the red man, on American paleography, on\r\nMaya hieroglyphics, on the anthropology of the new world, on Peruvian\r\ngraphic records,—not to name other papers by different writers. The\r\n_Transactions_ and _Journal_ of the society, as well as the _Popular\r\nMagazine of Anthropology_ (1866), made part in one form or another of\r\nthe _Anthropological Review_, begun in 1863, and discontinued in 1870,\r\nwhen the _Journal of Anthropology_ succeeded, but ceased the next year.\r\nThe _Proceedings_ of the society make one volume, 1873-75, under the\r\ntitle of _Anthropologia_, and the society also maintained a series\r\nof translations of foreign treatises, the first of which was Theodor\r\nWaitz’s _Introduction to Anthropology_, ed. from the German by J. F.\r\nCollingwood (1863); and this was followed by a version by James Hunt,\r\nthe president of the society, of Professor Carl Vogt’s _Lectures on\r\nMan, his place in Creation and in the history of the Earth_ (1864), and\r\nby other works of Broca, Pouchet, Blumenbach, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and\r\nIreland united some of these separate endeavors and began its _Journal_\r\nin 1871. The _Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society_ has also at\r\ntimes been the channel by which some of the leading anthropologists\r\nhave published their views, and a few papers of archæological import\r\nhave been given in the _Transactions_ (1884, etc.) of the Royal\r\nHistorical Society. Professedly broader relations belong to the\r\n_Transactions_ (_Comptes rendus_) of the International Congress of\r\nprehistoric (anthropology and) archæology, which began its sessions in\r\n1866.[1939] The latest summary is the _Archæological Review, a journal\r\nof historic and prehistoric antiquities_, edited by G. L. Gomme, of\r\nwhich the first number appeared in March, 1888, which has for a main\r\nfeature a bibliographical record of past and current archæological\r\nliterature.[1940]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the volumes of the Hakluyt Society’s publications,\r\nbeginning in 1847, in the annotated reprint of the early writers on\r\nAmerican nations and on the European contact with them, that the most\r\nsignal service has been done in England to the study of the early\r\nhistory of the new world. They are often referred to in the present\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Germany a _Magazin für die Naturgeschichte des Menschen_ was\r\npublished at Zittau as early as 1788-1791.\r\n\r\nWagner published at Vienna, in 1794-96, two volumes of _Beiträge zur\r\nphilosophischen Anthropologie_; and Heynig’s _Psychologisches (zugleich\r\nAnthropologisches) Magazin_ was published at Altenburg in 1796-97.\r\n\r\nThe Berliner Akademie der Wissenschaft began its _Abhandlungen_ in\r\n1804, but it was not till long after that date that Buschmann and\r\nothers used it as a channel of their views.\r\n\r\nVertuch’s _Archiv für Ethnographie und Linguistik_ (Weimar, 1807) only\r\nreached a single number.\r\n\r\nThe _Zeitschrift für physische Aerzte_, which was published by Nasse,\r\nat Leipzig, 1818-22, was succeeded by the _Zeitschrift für die\r\nAnthropologie_ (Leipzig, 1823-24), and this was followed by a single\r\nvolume, _Jahrbücher für Anthropologie_ (Leipzig, 1830).\r\n\r\nBran’s _Ethnographisches Archiv_ was published at Jena from 1818 to\r\n1829.\r\n\r\nIt was not till after 1860 that the new interest began to manifest\r\nitself, though Fechner’s _Centralblatt für Naturwissenschaften und\r\nAnthropologie_ was published at Leipzig in 1853-54.\r\n\r\nEcker’s _Archiv für Anthropologie_ was published at Braunschweig\r\nin 1866-68, which came in 1870 under the direction of the Deutsche\r\nGesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte, which\r\nalso began a _Correspondenzblatt_ in 1870, and a series, _Allgemeine\r\nVersammlung_, in 1873. This is the most important of the German\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nBastian’s _Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_ was begun at Berlin in 1869, and\r\nlater added a _Supplement_.\r\n\r\nThe Anthropologische Gesellschaft of Vienna began its _Mittheilungen_\r\nin 1870; and in 1887 the Prähistorische Commission of the Kais.\r\nAkad. der Wissenschaften at Vienna printed the first number of its\r\n_Mittheilungen_.\r\n\r\nThe _Verein für Anthropologie_ in Leipzig published but a single number\r\nof a _Bericht_ in 1871.\r\n\r\nThe Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und\r\nUrgeschichte continued its _Verhandlungen_ for 1871-72 only; and the\r\nGöttinger Anthropologischer Verein made but a bare beginning (1874) of\r\nits _Mittheilungen_.\r\n\r\nThe _Bericht_ of the Museum für Völkerkunde was begun in Leipzig in\r\n1874.\r\n\r\nThe Münchener Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, Ethnologie und\r\nUrgeschichte began the publication of _Beiträge_ in 1876.\r\n\r\nIn all these publications there have been papers interesting to\r\nAmerican archæologists, if only in a comparative way, and at times\r\nAmerican subjects have been frequent, especially in later years. The\r\npublications of zoölogical and geographical societies have in some\r\nrespects been at times of equal interest, but it has not been thought\r\nworth while to enumerate them.[1941]\r\n\r\nThe Königliche Museum at Berlin has a considerable collection of\r\nAmerican antiquities, which has been fostered by Humboldt and others,\r\nand the ethnological department has made some important publications\r\nlike those relating to _Amerika’s Nordwestküste_.[1942]\r\n\r\nWaitz in his _Anthropologie der Naturvölker_ (vol. iii.; _Die\r\nAmerikaner_, Th. i., Leipzig, 1862) has enumerated the literature of\r\nAmerican anthropology upon which he depended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe interest in most of the other European countries is more remotely\r\nAmerican. The Museum of Ethnography at St. Petersburg is not without\r\nsome objects of interest.[1943]\r\n\r\nIn Sweden the Antropologiska Sällskapet of Stockholm began a\r\n_Tidsskrift_ in 1875; but it affords little assistance to the\r\nAmericanist except in comparative study.[1944]\r\n\r\nThe student will find some suggestions in a little tract by J. J. A.\r\nWorsaae, _De l’organisation des musées historico-archéologiques dans le\r\nNord et ailleurs. Traduit par E. Beauvois_ (Copenhagen, 1885), which is\r\nextracted from the _Mémoires de la société royale des antiquaires de\r\nNord, 1885_.\r\n\r\nThere has begun recently in Leyden an _Internationales Archiv für\r\nEthnographie. Herausg. von Krist. Bahnson, Guido Cora [etc.]_ (Leiden,\r\n1888).\r\n\r\nIn Italy the _Archivio per l’Antropologia et la Etnologia_ was begun at\r\nFlorence in 1871, and was later made the organ of the Società Italiana\r\ndi Antropologia di Etnologia. There is an occasional paper in the\r\n_Bollettino della Società Geografica Italiana_, published at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn Spain the Sociedad Antropológica Española began at Madrid the\r\npublication of its _Revista de Antropologia_ in 1875.\r\n\r\nThe session of the Congrès des Américanistes at Madrid in 1881 gave a\r\nnew life in Spain to the study of American archæology and history, and\r\nout of this impulse there was begun a _Biblioteca de los Americanistas,\r\npublícala D. Justo Zaragoza; Editor D. Luis Navarro_; and the series\r\nhas been begun with the _Recordacion florida, discurso del reino de\r\nGuatemala_, an hitherto unpublished work (1690) of Francisco Antonio\r\nde Fuentes y Guzmán, edited by Justo Zaragoza; and with the _Historia\r\nde Venezuela_, being a third edition of the work of José de Oviedo y\r\nBaños, edited by C. F. Duro.\r\n\r\nThe Museo Nacional in Mexico has grown to have a proper\r\nimportance,[1945] since the Mexican government has prevented the\r\nfurther exportation of archæological relics. It was founded in 1824\r\nby Fathers Icaza and Gondra, but it owes its creation largely to the\r\nskill of Professor Gumesindo Mendoza, its curator, by whose death it\r\nlost much.[1946] There is a tendency to draw to it other collections.\r\nThere was a beginning made to publish illustrations of the relics in\r\nthe museum sixty years ago, but it came to little,[1947] and it was\r\nnot until recently the publication of _Anales del Museo Nacional de\r\nMéjico_ was begun that there seemed to be a proper effort made. The\r\nperiodicals _Revista Mexicana_ (1835), and _Museo Mexicano_ (1843-45)\r\nhave done something to illustrate the subject,—not to name others of\r\nless importance. The principal periodical source farther south, the\r\n_Registro Yucatéco_, only ran to four volumes, published at Merida in\r\n1845-46.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous archæological repository in South America is that\r\nof the National Museum at Rio de Janeiro, whose published _Mémoires_\r\ncontain important contributions to Brazilian Archæology.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The editor must be understood as approaching the purely archæological\r\nside of the study of Aboriginal America, as a student of the literature\r\npertaining to it, rather than as a critic of phenomena. He has not\r\nproceeded even in this course without consultation with Professors\r\nPutnam, Haynes, and Brinton, with Mr. Lucien Carr and with Señor\r\nIcazbalceta._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Reference is commonly made but once to a book, if repeatedly mentioned\r\nin the text; but other references are made when additional information\r\nabout the book is conveyed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  AA, VAN DER, _Voyagien_, xxxv.\r\n\r\n  Abancay, 236.\r\n\r\n  Abbot, C.

It preserves\r\nsome titles which are not otherwise known; and represents a library\r\nwhich Kennett had gathered for presentation to the Society for the\r\nPropagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. Rich (_Bibl. Amer. nova_,\r\ni. 21) says the index was made by Robert Watts. Although Stevens\r\n(Historical Collections, i. 142) says that the books were dispersed,\r\nthe library is still in existence in London, though it lacks many\r\ntitles given in the printed catalogue, and shows others not in that\r\nvolume.

It is noteworthy,\r\nin view of so rich an accession coming from Germany, that Grahame,\r\nthe historian of our colonial period, says that in 1825 he found the\r\nUniversity Library at Göttingen richer in books for his purpose than\r\nall the libraries of Britain joined together.\r\n\r\n[19] This collection is also embraced in the Catalogue of the College\r\nLibrary already referred to. Mr. Warden began the collection of\r\nanother library, which he used while writing the American part (10\r\nvols.) of the _Art de vérifier des Dates_, Paris, 1826-1844, and which\r\n(1,118 works) was afterward sold to the State Library at Albany for\r\n$4,000. Dr. Henry A. Homes, the librarian at Albany, informs me that\r\nwhen arranged it made twenty-one hundred and twenty-three volumes.\r\nWarden’s _Bibliotheca Americana_, Paris, 1831, reprinted at Paris in\r\n1840, is a catalogue of this collection. Mr. Warden died in 1845,\r\naged 67. Cf. Ludewig in the _Serapeum_, 1845, p. 209; Muller, _Books\r\non America_ (1872), no. 1734; Allibone, iii. 2,579; S. G. Goodrich,\r\n_Recollections_, ii. 243; Jackson’s _Bibl. Géog._, nos. 617, 618;\r\nTrübner, _Bibliographical Guide_, p. xiv. There was a final sale of Mr.\r\nWarden’s books by Horatio Hill, in New York, in 1846.\r\n\r\n[20] This portrait of one of the earliest contributors to the\r\nbibliography of American history follows an engraving in the\r\n_Allgemeine geographische Ephemeriden_, May, 1800, p. 395. Ebeling was\r\nborn Nov. 20, 1741, and died June 30, 1817, and his own contributions\r\nto American History were—\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Amerikanische Bibliothek_ (Zwei Stücke), Leipzig, 1777.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Erdbescreibung und Geschichte von America_, Hamburg, 1795-1816,\r\nin seven vols.; the author’s interleaved copy, with manuscript notes,\r\nis in Harvard College Library.\r\n\r\n(_c_) With Professor Hegewisch, _Americanisches Magazin_, Hamburg, 1797.\r\n\r\nThere are other likenesses,—one a large lithograph published at\r\nHamburgh; the other a small profile by C. H. Kniep. Both are in the\r\ncollection of the American Antiquarian Society.\r\n\r\n[21] This collection was offered to Congress for purchase through\r\nEdward Everett in December, 1827. The printed list, with nearly a\r\nhundred entries for manuscripts and three hundred and eighty-nine for\r\nprinted books, covering the years 1506-1825, was printed as Document\r\n37 of the 1st session of the 20th Congress. The sale was not effected.\r\nRich had been able to gather the books at moderate cost because of the\r\ntroubled political state of the peninsula. Trübner, _Bibliographical\r\nGuide_, p. xv.\r\n\r\n[22] _Dictionary_, ii. 1788.\r\n\r\n[23] _Bibl. Amer. Vet._, p. xxix.\r\n\r\n[24] Dibdin (_Library Companion_, edition 1825, p. 467) refers to\r\nthis spirit, hoping it would lead to a new edition of White Kennett,\r\nperfected to date.\r\n\r\n[25] _Bibliotheca Grenvilliana_ (London, 1842), now a part of the\r\nBritish Museum.\r\n\r\n[26] Sabin, _Bibliog. of Bibliog._, p. cxxi; Allibone, _Dictionary_,\r\np. 1787; Trübner, _Bibliographical Guide to American Literature_,\r\nIntroduction, p. xiv; Jackson’s _Bibl.

Puttick and Simpson’s _Catalogues_, London, June 25, 1850, and\r\nMarch, April, and May, 1872, note some of his books, besides manuscript\r\nbibliographies.\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Rich’s death Mr. Edward G. Allen took the business, and\r\nissued various catalogues of books on America in 1857-1871. Cf.\r\nJackson’s _Bibliog. Géog._, nos. 677-682.\r\n\r\n[27] See Vol. III. p. 159. The catalogue, being without date, is\r\nsometimes given later than 1833. Cf. Jackson, _Bibliog. Géog._, no.\r\n636; and no. 690. A new _Rough List_ of the Barlow Collection was\r\nprinted in 1885.\r\n\r\n[28] _Magazine of American History_, iii. 177. This library was sold in\r\nNovember, 1836, as Raetzel’s; the numbers 908-2,117 concerned America.\r\nTrübner (_Bibliographical Guide_, p. xviii) says the collection was\r\nformed by Ternaux probably with an ultimate view to sale. Ternaux did\r\nnot die till December, 1864.\r\n\r\n[29] Now worth 40 or 50 francs.\r\n\r\n[30] Trübner, _Bibliographical Guide_, p. xvi.\r\n\r\n[31] See Vol. IV. p. 367. Cf. also Trübner, _Bibliographical Guide_,\r\np. xviii; and Daniel’s _Nos Gloires Nationales_, where will be found a\r\nportrait of Faribault.\r\n\r\n[32] Sabin, x. nos. 42, 644-42, 645.\r\n\r\n[33] Sabin, x. 42, 643; Trübner, _Bibliographical Guide_, p. xxi.\r\n\r\n[34] _Historical Magazine_, xii. 145; Allibone, ii. p. 1142. The sale\r\nof Mr. Ludewig’s library (1,380 entries) took place in New York in 1858.\r\n\r\n[35] In his _Verrazano_, p. 5.\r\n\r\n[36] Cf. also D’Avezac in his _Waltzemüller_, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[37] Sabin, viii. p. 107; Jackson, _Bibliog. Géog._, no. 696. The\r\nedition was four hundred copies.\r\n\r\n[38] An error traced to the proof-reader, it is said in Sabin’s\r\n_Bibliog. of Bibliog._, p. lxxiv.\r\n\r\n[39] Stevens noticed this defence by reiterating his charges in a note\r\nin his _Bibliotheca Historica_, 1870, no. 860.\r\n\r\n[40] Vol. IV. p. 366.\r\n\r\n[41] Sabin, _Bibliography of Bibliographies_, p. lxxv.\r\n\r\n[42] _Grandeur et décadence de la Colombine_, Paris, 1885.\r\n\r\n[43] _J. J. Cooke Catalogue_, no. 2,214; _Griswold Catalogue_, nos.\r\n730, 731. The editions were fifty copies on large paper, two hundred\r\non small. It may be worth record that Gowan, a publisher in New York,\r\nwas the earliest (1846) to instigate a taste for large paper copies\r\namong American collectors, by printing in that style Furman’s edition\r\nof Denton’s _Description of New York_, after the manner of the English\r\npurveyors to book-fancying.\r\n\r\n[44] See _Proceedings of the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society_,\r\nPhiladelphia, 1881, p. 28.\r\n\r\n[45] Mr. Wilberforce Eames is the new editor. A list of the catalogues\r\nprepared by Mr. Sabin is given in his _Bibliography of Bibliographies_,\r\np. cxxiv, etc.\r\n\r\n[46] The German translation, _Kritische Untersuchungen_, was made by J.\r\nI. Ideler, Berlin, 1852, in 3 vols. It has an index, which the French\r\nedition lacks.\r\n\r\n[47] Sabin, viii. 539. The edition of Paris, without date, called\r\n_Histoire de la géographie du nouveau continent_, is the same, with\r\na new title and an introduction of four pages, La Cosa’s map being\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\n[48] _Verrazano_, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[49] In his _Cosmos_ Humboldt gives results, which he says are reached\r\nin his unpublished sixth volume of the _Examen critique_.\r\n\r\n[50] The Humboldt Library was burned in London in June, 1865. Nearly\r\nall of the catalogues were destroyed at the same time; but a few large\r\npaper copies were saved, which, being perfected with a new title\r\n(London, 1878), have since been offered by Stevens for sale. Portions\r\nof the introduction to it are also used in an article by Stevens on\r\nHumboldt, in the _Journal of Sciences and Arts_ January, 1870. Various\r\nof Humboldt’s manuscripts on American matters are advertised in\r\nStargardt’s _Amerika und Orient_, no. 135, p. 3 (Berlin, 1881).\r\n\r\n[51] Cf. _Historical Magazine_, vol. ix. no. 335; _Magazine of American\r\nHistory_, vol. ii. pp. 193, 221, 565; _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, April,\r\n1868. Colonel Force died in January, 1868.\r\n\r\n[52] Mr. Sparks died March 14, 1866. Tributes were paid to his memory\r\nby distinguished associates in the Massachusetts Historical Society\r\n(_Proceedings_, ix. 157), and Dr. George E. Ellis reported to them a\r\nfull and appreciative memoir (_Proceedings_, x. 211). Cf. also _Amer.\r\nAntiq. Soc. Proc._, March, 1866; _Historical Magazine_, May, 1866;\r\nBrantz Mayer before the Maryland Historical Society, 1867, etc.\r\n\r\n[53] Cf. _Historical Magazine_, vol. ix. p. 137.\r\n\r\n[54] The principal interpreter of the Indian languages of the temperate\r\nparts of North America has been Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull, of Hartford,\r\nfor whose labor in the bibliography of the subject see a chapter in\r\nvol i. of the _Memorial History of Boston_. There is also a collection\r\nedited by him, of books in and upon the Indian languages, in the\r\n_Brinley Catalogue_, iii. 123-145. He gave in the _Proceedings_ of\r\nthe American Antiquarian Society, and also separately in 1874, a list\r\nof books in the Indian languages, printed at Cambridge and Boston,\r\n1653-1721 (Field, _Indian Bibliography_, no. 1,571). Cf. also Ludewig’s\r\n_Literature of American Aboriginal Languages_, mentioned on an\r\nearlier page. It was edited and corrected by William W. Turner. (Cf.\r\n_Pinart-Brasseur Catalogue_, no. 565; Field, _Indian Bibliography_, no.\r\n959).\r\n\r\nIcazbalceta published in 1866, at Mexico, a list of the writers on the\r\nlanguages of America; and Romero made a similar enumeration of those of\r\nMexico, in 1862, in the _Boletin de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geografia_,\r\nvol. viii. Dr. Daniel G. Brinton has made a good introduction to the\r\nliterary history of the native Americans in his _Aboriginal American\r\nAuthors_, published by him at Philadelphia in 1883. For his own\r\nlinguistic contributions, see Field, _Indian Bibliography_, no. 187,\r\netc. One of the earliest enumerations of linguistic titles can be\r\npicked out of the list which Boturini Benaduci, in 1746, appended to\r\nhis _Idea de una nueva historia general de la America septentrional_.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive enumeration of the literature of all the North\r\nAmerican tongues is doubtless to be the _Bibliography of North American\r\nLinguistics_, which is preparing by Mr. James C. Pilling of the Bureau\r\nof Ethnology in Washington, and which will be published in due time\r\nby that bureau. A preliminary issue (100 copies) for corrections is\r\ncalled _Proof-sheets of a Bibliography of the Indian Languages of North\r\nAmerica_ (pp. xl, 1135).\r\n\r\nThe _Bibliotheca Americana_ of Leclerc (Paris, 1879) affords many\r\ntitles to which a preliminary “Table des Divisions” affords an index,\r\nand most of them are grouped under the heading “Linguistique,” p. 537,\r\netc. The third volume of H. H. Bancroft’s Native Races, particularly\r\nin its notes, is a necessary aid in this study; and a convenient\r\nsummary of the whole subject will be found in chapter x. of John T.\r\nShort’s _North Americans of Antiquity_. J. C. E. Buschmann has been\r\nan ardent laborer in this field; the bibliographies give his printed\r\nworks (Field’s _Indian Bibliography_, p. 208, etc.), and Stargardt’s\r\n_Catalogue_ (no. 135, p. 6) shows some of his manuscripts. The Comte\r\nHyacinthe de Charencey has for some years, from time to time, printed\r\nvarious minor monographs on these subjects; and in 1883 he collected\r\nhis views in a volume of _Mélanges de philologie et de paléographie\r\nAméricaines_.\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Brasseur de Bourbourg, in his _Bibliothèque\r\nMexico-Guatemalienne_ (Leclerc, nos. 81, 1,084), has given for\r\nCentral America a very excellent list of the works on the linguistics\r\nof the natives, which are all contained also in the _Catalogue_\r\nof the Pinart-Brasseur sale, which took place in Paris in January\r\nand February, 1884. Cf. the paper on Brasseur by Dr. Brinton, in\r\n_Lippincott’s Magazine_, vol. i.; and the enumeration of his numerous\r\nwritings in Sabin’s _Dictionary_, ii. 7,420; also Leclerc, Field, and\r\nBancroft.\r\n\r\nDr. Félix C. Y. Sobron’s _Los Idiomas de la America Latina,—Estudios\r\nBiografico-bibliograficos_, published a few years since at Madrid,\r\ngives, according to Dr. Brinton, extended notices of several rare\r\nvolumes; but on the whole the book is neither exhaustive nor very\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\nJulius Platzmann’s _Verzeichniss einer Auswahl Amerikanischer\r\nGrammatiken_, etc. (Leipsic, 1876), is a small but excellent list, with\r\nproper notes. These bibliographies will show the now numerous works\r\nupon the aboriginal tongues, their construction and their fruits.\r\n\r\nThere are several important series interesting to the student, which\r\nare found in the catalogues. Such are the _Bibliothèque linguistique\r\nAméricaine_, published in seven volumes by Maisonneuve in Paris\r\n(Leclerc, no. 2,674); the _Coleccion de linguistica y etnografía\r\nAmericanas_, or _Bibliothèque de linguistique et d’Ethnographie\r\nAméricaines_, 1875, etc., edited by A. L. Pinart; the _Library of\r\nAmerican Linguistics_, in thirteen volumes, edited by Dr. John G. Shea\r\n(Cf. _Brinley Catalogue_, vol. iii. no. 5,631; Field, no. 1,396);\r\n_Brinton’s Library of Aboriginal American Literature_, published by Dr.\r\nD. G. Brinton in Philadelphia; and Brasseur de Bourbourg’s _Collection\r\nde documents dans les langues indigènes_, Paris, 1861-1864, in four\r\nvolumes (cf. Field, p. 175).\r\n\r\nThe earliest work printed exclusively in a native language was the\r\n_Catecismo de la Doctrina Cristiana en lengua Timuiquana_, published at\r\nMexico in 1617 (cf. Sabin, vol. xiv. no. 58,580; Finotti, p. 14). This\r\nis the statement often made; but Mr. Pilling refers me to references\r\nin Icazbalceta’s _Zumárraga_ (vol. 1. p. 200) to an earlier edition\r\nof about 1547; and in the same author’s _Bibliografia Mexicana_ (p.\r\n32), to one of 1553. Molina’s _Vocabulario de la lengua Castellana y\r\nMexicana_, placing the Nahuatl and Castilian in connection, was printed\r\nat Mexico in 1555. The book is very rare, five or six copies only being\r\nknown; and Quaritch has priced an imperfect copy at £72 (Quaritch,\r\n_Bibliog. Géog. linguistica_, 1879, no. 12,616; Carter-Brown, vol. i.\r\nno. 206; _Brinley Catalogue_, vol. iii. no, 5,771). The edition of 1571\r\nis also rare (_Pinart-Brasseur Catalogue_, no. 630; Carter-Brown, vol.\r\ni. nos. 285, 286; Quaritch, 1879, no. 12,617). The first edition of\r\nMolina’s Aztec grammar, _Arte de la lengua Mexicana y Castellana_, was\r\npublished the same year (1571). Quaritch (1879, no. 12,615) prices this\r\nat £52 10_s._ Cf. also Carter-Brown, vol. i. no. 284. One of the chief\r\nof the more recent studies of the linguistics of Mexico is Francisco\r\nPimentel’s _Cuadro descriptivo y comparativo de las lenguas indigenas\r\nde México_, Mexico, 1862-1865; and second edition in 1874-1875.\r\n\r\nThis subject has other treatment later in the present volume.\r\n\r\n[55] It included two thousand and thirty-four items, ninety-four of\r\nwhich were Mr. Squier’s own works.\r\n\r\n[56] Vol. II. p. 578.\r\n\r\n[57] He says that up to 1881 he had gathered 35,000 volumes, at a cost\r\nof $300,000, exclusive of time and travelling expenses. His manuscripts\r\nembraced 1,200 volumes. The annual growth of his library is still 1,000\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n[58] One twelfth of the earth’s surface, as he says.\r\n\r\n[59] Cf. account of Maximilian’s library in the _Bookworm_ (1869), p.\r\n14.\r\n\r\n[60] These biographical data are derived from a tract given out by\r\nhimself which he calls _A brief account of the literary undertakings\r\nof Hubert Howe Bancroft_ (San Francisco, A. L. Bancroft & Co. [his own\r\nbusiness house], 1882, 8vo, pp. 12). Other accounts of his library will\r\nbe found in the _American Bibliopolist_, vii. 44; and in Apponyi’s\r\n_Libraries of California_, 1878. Descriptions of the library and of the\r\nbrick building (built in 1881) which holds it, and of his organized\r\nmethods, have occasionally appeared in the _Overland Monthly_ and in\r\nother serial issues of California, as well as in those of the Atlantic\r\ncities. He has been free to make public the most which is known\r\nregarding his work. He says that the grouping and separating of his\r\nmaterial has been done mostly by others, who have also written fully\r\none half of the text of what he does not hesitate to call _The Works\r\nof Hubert Howe Bancroft_; and he leaves the reader to derive a correct\r\nunderstanding of the case from his prefaces and illustrative tracts.\r\nCf. J. C. Derby’s _Fifty Years among authors, books, and publishers_\r\n(New York, 1884), p. 31.\r\n\r\n[61] Averaging twelve from that time to this; a hundred persons were\r\ntried for every one ultimately retained as a valuable assistant,—is his\r\nown statement.\r\n\r\n[62] At a cost, as he says, of $80,000 to 1882.\r\n\r\n[63] They appeared in _The Nation_ and in the _New York Independent_\r\nearly in 1883. The first aimed to show that there were substantial\r\ngrounds for dissent from Mr. Bancroft’s views regarding the Aztec\r\ncivilization. The second ignored that point in controversy, and merely\r\nproposed, as was stated, to test the “bibliographic value” which Mr.\r\nBancroft had claimed for his book, and to point out the failures of the\r\nindex plan and the vicarious system as employed by him.\r\n\r\n[64] Seemingly intended to make part of one of the later volumes of his\r\nseries, to be called _Essays and Miscellanies_.\r\n\r\n[65] With a general title (as following his _Native Races_) of _The\r\nHistory of the Pacific States_, we are to have in twenty-eight volumes\r\nthe history of Central America, Mexico, North Mexico, New Mexico,\r\nArizona, California, Nevada, Utah, Northwest Coast, Oregon, Washington,\r\nIdaho, Montana, British Columbia, and Alaska,—to be followed by six\r\nvolumes of allied subjects, not easily interwoven in the general\r\nnarrative, making thirty-nine volumes for the entire work. The volumes\r\nare now appearing at the rate of three or four a year.\r\n\r\n[66] The list which is prefixed to the first volume of the _History\r\nof California_, forming vol. xiii. of his Pacific States series, is\r\nparticularly indicative of the rich stores of his library, and greatly\r\neclipses the previous lists of Mr. A. S. Taylor, which appeared in\r\nthe _Sacramento Daily Union_, June 25, 1863 and March 13, 1866. Cf.\r\nHarrisse, _Bibl. Amer. Vet._, p. xxxix. A copy of Taylor’s pioneer\r\nwork, with his own corrections, is in Harvard College Library. Mr.\r\nBancroft speaks very ungraciously of it.\r\n\r\n[67] See Vol. IV., chap. i. p. 19.\r\n\r\n[68] Jackson, _Bibl.

Mr. Murphy\r\ndied Dec. 1, 1882, aged seventy-two; and his collection, then very\r\nmuch enlarged, was sold in March, 1884. Its _Catalogue_, edited by Mr.\r\nJohn Russell Bartlett, shows one of the richest libraries of Americana\r\nwhich has been given to public sale in America. It is accompanied by a\r\nbiographical sketch of its collector. Cf. Vol. IV. p. 22.\r\n\r\n[69] Cf. Wynne’s _Private Libraries of New York_, p. 106.

His father was Robert Lenox,\r\na Scotchman, who began business in New York in 1783, and retired in\r\n1812 with a large fortune, including a farm of thirty acres, worth\r\nthen about $6,000, and to-day $10,000,000,—if such figures can be made\r\naccurate. Cf. also Charles Deane in _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, April,\r\n1880. Henry Stevens’s _Recoll. of Lenox_ is conspicuous for what it\r\ndoes not reveal.\r\n\r\n[72] The Lenox Library is now under the direction of the distinguished\r\nAmerican historical student, Dr. George H. Moore, so long in charge of\r\nthe New York Historical Society’s library. Cf. an account of Dr. Moore\r\nby Howard Crosby in the _Historical Magazine_, vol. xvii. (January,\r\n1870). The officer in immediate charge of the library is Dr. S. Austin\r\nAllibone, well known for his _Dictionary of Authors_.\r\n\r\n[73] Mr. Bartlett was early in life a dealer in books in New York; and\r\nthe Americana catalogues of Bartlett and Welford, forty years ago, were\r\namong the best of dealers’ lists. Jackson’s _Bibl. Géog._, no. 641.\r\n\r\n[74] The field of Americana before 1800 has been so nearly exhausted\r\nin its composition, that recent purchases have been made in other\r\ndepartments, particularly of costly books on the fine arts.\r\n\r\n[75] Cf. Vol. III. p. 380.\r\n\r\n[76] Because Greenland in the map of the Ptolemy of this year is laid\r\ndown. The slightest reference to America in books of the sixteenth\r\ncentury have entitled them to admission.\r\n\r\n[77] The book purports to have been printed in one hundred copies; but\r\nnot more than half that number, it is said, have been distributed.\r\nSome copies have a title reading, _Bibliographical notices of rare\r\nand curious books relating to America, printed in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries, in the library of the late John Carter Brown, by\r\nJohn Russell Bartlett_.\r\n\r\n[78] Sir Arthur Helps, in referring to the assistance he had got from\r\nbooks sent to him from America, and from this library in particular,\r\nsays: “As far as I have been able to judge, the American collectors of\r\nbooks are exceedingly liberal and courteous in the use of them, and\r\nseem really to understand what the object should be in forming a great\r\nlibrary.” _Spanish Conquest_, American edition, p. 122.\r\n\r\n[79] Cf. _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, October, 1875.\r\n\r\n[80] Dr. Trumbull himself has been a keen collector of books on\r\nAmerican history, particularly in illustration of his special study\r\nof aboriginal linguistics; while his influence has not been unfelt in\r\nthe forming of the Watkinson Library, and of that of the Connecticut\r\nHistorical Society, both at Hartford.\r\n\r\n[81] The first sale—there are to be four—took place in March, 1878,\r\nand illustrated a new device in testamentary bequests. Mr. Brinley\r\ndevised to certain libraries the sum of several thousand dollars each,\r\nto be used to their credit for purchases made at the public sale of his\r\nbooks. The result was a competition that carried the aggregate of the\r\nsales, it is computed, as much beyond the sum which might otherwise\r\nhave been obtained, as was the amount devised,—thus impairing in\r\nno degree the estate for the heirs, and securing credit for public\r\nbequests. The scheme has been followed in the sale of the library (the\r\nthird part of which was Americana, largely from the Menzies library) of\r\nthe late J. J. Cooke, of Providence, with an equivalent appreciation\r\nof the prices of the books. It is a question if the interests of the\r\nlibraries benefited are advanced by such artificial stimulation of\r\nprices, which a factitious competition helps to make permanent.\r\n\r\n[82] _American Bibliopolist_, viii. 128; Wynne’s _Private Libraries of\r\nNew York_, p. 318. The collection was not exclusively American.\r\n\r\n[83] Memoir of Mr. Crowninshield, by Charles Deane, in _Mass. Hist.\r\nSoc. Proc._, xvii. 356.

A collection announced for\r\nsale in Boston in 1845 was withdrawn after the catalogue was printed,\r\nhaving been sold to the Connecticut Historical Society for $4,000.\r\nAt one time he amassed a large collection of American school-books\r\nto illustrate our educational history. They were bought (about four\r\nhundred in all) by the British Museum.\r\n\r\n[109] Cf. Jackson’s _Bibl. Géog._, no. 684, and pp. 185, 199. Also see\r\nVol. III. 361.\r\n\r\n[110] His catalogues are spiced with annotations signed “Western\r\nMemorabilia.” Sabin (_Dictionary_, vii. 369) quotes the saying\r\nof a rival regarding Gowans’s catalogues, that their notes “were\r\ndistinguished by much originality, some personality, and not a little\r\nbad grammar.” His shop and its master are drawn in F. B. Perkins’s\r\n_Scrope, or the Lost Library_. _A Novel_. Mr. Gowans died in November,\r\n1870, at sixty-seven, leaving a stock, it is said, of 250,000 bound\r\nvolumes, besides a pamphlet collection of enormous extent. Mr. W. C.\r\nPrime told the story of his life, genially, in _Harper’s Magazine_\r\n(1872), in an article on “Old Books in New York.” Speaking of his\r\nstock, Mr. Prime says: “There were many more valuable collections in\r\nthe hands of booksellers, but none so large, and probably none so\r\nwholly without arrangement.” Mr. Gowans was a Scotchman by birth, and\r\ncame to America in 1821. After a varied experience on a Mississippi\r\nflat-boat, he came to New York, and in 1827 began life afresh as a\r\nbookseller’s clerk.

The\r\nextent and character of his stock can be inferred from the fact that\r\nhis purchases at the Perkins sale (1873) amounted to £11,000; at the\r\nTite sale (1874), £9,500; at the Didot sales (1878-1879), £11,600; and\r\nat the Sunderland sales (1883), £32,650, out of a total of £56,851.\r\nAt the recent sales of the Beckford and Hamilton collections, which\r\nproduced £86,444, over one half, or £44,105, went to Mr. Quaritch.\r\nThese figures enable one to understand how, in a sense, Mr. Quaritch\r\ncommands the world’s market of choice books. A sketch, _B. Q., a\r\nbiographical and bibliographical Fragment_ (1880, 25 copies), in the\r\nprivately printed series of monographs issued to a club in London, of\r\nwhich Mr. Quaritch is president, called “The Sette of Odd Volumes,”\r\nhas supplied the above data. The sketch is by C. W. H. Wyman, and\r\nis also reprinted in his _Bibliography of Printing_, and in the\r\n_Antiquarian Magazine and Bibliographer_, November, 1882. One of the\r\nclub’s “opuscula” (no. iii.) has an excellent likeness of Mr. Quaritch\r\nprefixed. Cf. also the memoir and portrait in Bigmore and Wyman’s\r\n_Bibliography of Printing_, ii. 230.\r\n\r\n[118] Jackson, nos. 643-649; Trübner, _Bibliographical Guide_, p. xix.\r\n\r\n[119] Mr. Trübner died in London March 30, 1884. Cf. memorial in\r\n_The Library Chronicle_, April, 1884, p. 43, by W. E. A. Axon;\r\nalso a “Nekrolog” by Karl J. Trübner in the _Centralblatt für\r\nBibliothekswesen_, June, 1884, p. 240.\r\n\r\n[120] Cf. notice by Mr. Brevoort in _Magazine of American History_, iv.\r\n230.\r\n\r\n[121] There is a paper on “Edwin Tross et ses publications relatives\r\nà l’Amérique” in _Miscellanées bibliographiques_, Paris, 1878, p. 53,\r\ngiving a list of his imprints which concern America.\r\n\r\n[122] Jackson, nos. 689, 703, 717.\r\n\r\n[123] Vol. IV. chap. viii. editorial note. There is an account\r\nof Muller and his bibliographical work in the _Centralblatt für\r\nBibliothekswesen_, November, 1884.\r\n\r\n[124] Jackson, nos. 650-654; Trübner, _Bibliographical Guide_, p.\r\nxix; Sabin, _Bibliog. of Bibliog._, p. cv; Petzholdt, _Bibliotheca\r\nBibliographica_.\r\n\r\n[125] More or less help will be derived from the American portion of\r\nthe _Liste provisoire de bibliographies géographiques spéciales, par\r\nJames Jackson_, published in 1881 by the Société de Géographie de\r\nParis,—a book of which use has been made in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\n[126] See the chapter on the libraries of Boston in the _Memorial\r\nHistory of Boston_, vol. iv.\r\n\r\n[127] The extent of Dr. Dexter’s library is evident from the signs\r\nof possession which are so numerously scattered through the 7,250\r\ntitles that constitute the exhaustive and very careful bibliography of\r\nCongregationalism and the allied phases of religious history, which\r\nforms an appendix to his _Congregationalism as seen in its Literature_,\r\nNew York, 1880. He explains in the Introduction to his volume the\r\nwide scope which he intended to give to this list; and to show how\r\npoorly off our largest public libraries in America are in the earliest\r\nbooks illustrating this movement, he says that of the 1,000 earliest\r\ntitles which he gives, and which bear date between 1546 and 1644, he\r\nfound only 208 in American libraries. His arrangement of titles is\r\nchronological, but he has a full name-index.\r\n\r\nThe students of the early English colonies cannot fail to find\r\nfor certain phases of their history much help from Joseph\r\nSmith’s _Descriptive Catalogue of Friends’ Books_, London, 1867;\r\nhis _Bibliotheca Anti-Quakeriana_, 1873; and his _Bibliotheca\r\nQuakeristica_, a bibliography of miscellaneous literature relating to\r\nthe Friends, of which Part I. was issued in London in 1883.\r\n\r\n[128] The private library of George Bancroft is in Washington. It is\r\ndescribed as it existed some years ago in Wynne’s _Private Libraries of\r\nNew York_.\r\n\r\n[129] A book on the private libraries of San Francisco by Apponyi was\r\nissued in 1878.\r\n\r\n[130] An account of the libraries of the various historical societies\r\nin the United States is given in the _Public Libraries of the United\r\nStates_, issued by the Bureau of Education at Washington in 1876.\r\n\r\n[131] The title is quoted differently by different authorities.\r\nHarrisse, _Bibl. Amer. Vet._, no. 32, and _Additions_, no. 16; his\r\n_Christophe Colomb_, i. 89; Humboldt, _Examen critique_, iv. 67;\r\nSabin, _Dictionary of Books relating to America_, x. 327; D’Avezac,\r\n_Waltzemüller_, p. 79; Varnhagen, _Nouvelles Recherches_, p. 17;\r\nIrving’s _Columbus_, app. ix.\r\n\r\n[132] See Vol. IV. p. 12. The editorship is in dispute,—whether Zorzi\r\nor Montalboddo. The better opinion seems to be that Humboldt erred in\r\nassigning it to Zorzi rather than to Montalboddo. Cf.

The _Paesi novamente\r\nretrovati_ is shown in the chapter on the Cortereals in Vol. IV. to\r\nbe of importance in elucidating the somewhat obscure story of that\r\nportion of the early Portuguese discoveries in North America. Since\r\nVol. IV. was printed, two important contributions to this study have\r\nbeen made. One is the monograph of Henry Harrisse, _Les Cortereal et\r\nleur voyages au Nouveau-monde. D’après des documents nouveaux ou peu\r\nconnus tirés des archives de Lisbonne et de Modène. Suivi du texte\r\ninédit d’un recit de la troisième expédition de Gasper Cortereal et\r\nd’une carte nautique portugaise de 1502 reproduite ici pour la première\r\njois. Mémoire lu à l’Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres\r\ndans sa séance du 1er juin, 1883_, and published in Paris in 1883,\r\nas Vol. III. of the _Recueil de voyages et de documents pour servir\r\nà l’histoire de la géographie depuis le XIIIe jusqu’à la fin du XVIe\r\nsiècle_. The other is the excerpt from the _Archivo des Açores_,\r\nwhich was drawn from that work by the editor, Ernesto do Canto, and\r\nprinted separately at Ponta Delgarda (S. Miguel) in an edition of one\r\nhundred copies, under the title of _Os Corte-Reaes, memoria historica\r\naccompanhada de muitos documentos ineditos_. Do Canto refers (p. 34) to\r\nother monographs on the Portuguese discoveries in America as follows:\r\nSebastião Francisco Mendo Trigoso,—_Ensaio sobre os Descobrimentos e\r\nCommercio dos Portuguezes em as Terras Septentrionaes da America_,\r\npresented to the Lisbon Academy (1813), and published in their\r\n_Memorias da Litteratura_, viii. 305.

Undated; but cited by Sabin, vol. xii.\r\nno. 51,391-51,393.—1592, 1598. In these editions the twenty-six maps\r\nand the woodcuts are engraved after new drawings. That of 1592 is in the\r\nBoston Athenæum; that of 1598 is in Harvard College Library. The likeness\r\nof Münster on the title is inscribed: “Seins alters lx jar.” America\r\nis shown in the general mappemonde, and in map no. xxvi., “Die Newe\r\nWelt.” Sabin, vol. xii. no. 51,394-51,395.—1614, 1628. These Basle\r\neditions reproduced the engravings of the 1592 and 1598 editions, and\r\nare considered the completest issues of the German text. They are worth\r\nfrom 30 to 40 marks each. Sabin, vol. xii. no. 51,396.\r\n\r\n[178] The _Athenæ Rauricæ_ gives a Latin edition of 1545.\r\n\r\n[179] This 1550 Latin edition has fourteen maps, and copies are worth\r\nfrom $12 to $15.

These editions have been bought of late years for\r\nabout $4; but Rosenthal (Munich, 1884) prices a copy of 1552 at 130\r\nmarks, and one of 1554 at 150 marks.\r\n\r\n[181] Sabin, vol. xii. no. 51,382; Muller, _Books on America_ (1872),\r\np. 11.\r\n\r\n[182] Some copies have nineteen maps, others twenty-two in all.

It is usually priced at about $20; the copies\r\nare commonly worn (Sabin, vol. xii. no. 51,398). The same publisher,\r\nHenry Pierre, reissued it (without date) in 1568, with twelve folding\r\nwoodcut maps, the first of which pertains to America (Carter-Brown,\r\nvol. i. no. 271; Sabin, vol. xii. no. 51,399). In 1575 a new French\r\nedition, with the cuts reduced, was issued in three volumes, folio,\r\nedited by Belleforest and others; it gives 101 pages to America.

Of\r\ninterest in connection with the present History, there are in the first\r\nvolume of Ramusio the voyages of Da Gama, Vespucius, and Magellan, as\r\nwell as matter of interest in connection with Cabot (see Vol. III. p.\r\n24); in the second volume (1559), the travels of Marco Polo, the voyage\r\nof the Zeni and of Cabot. The first edition of the first volume was\r\npublished in 1550; Ramusio’s name does not appear. A second edition\r\ncame out in 1554.

The portrait of him by\r\nPaul Veronese in the hall of the Great Council was burned in 1557; and\r\nCicogna (_Biblioteca Veneziana_, ii. 310) says that the likeness now in\r\nthe Sala dello Scudo is imaginary.\r\n\r\n[191] Cf. also Camus, _Mémoire sur De Bry_, p. 8; Humboldt, _Examen\r\ncritique_; Hallam, _Literature of Europe_; Harrisse, _Bibl.

There was a well-known second\r\nedition of the third volume in 1565 (differing in title only from the\r\n1556 edition), which, with a first volume of 1588 and a second volume\r\nof 1583, is thought to make up the most desirable copy; though there\r\nare some qualifications in the case, since the 1606 edition of the\r\nthird volume is really more complete.\r\n\r\n[192] Carter-Brown, vol. i. no. 275.\r\n\r\n[193] Cf.

Goldsmid, of\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\n[199] The title, however, as given in catalogues generally, runs:\r\n_Collectiones peregrinationum in Indiam orientalem et Indiam\r\noccidentalem, XXV partibus comprehensæ a Theodoro, Joan-Theodoro De\r\nBry, et a Matheo Merian publicatæ. Francofurti ad Mænum_, 1590-1634.\r\n\r\n[200] This part is of extreme rarity, and Dibdin says that Lord Oxford\r\nbought the copy in the Grenville Library in 1740 for £140. Cf. Vol. III.\r\n\r\n[201] The earliest description of a set of De Bry of any\r\nbibliographical moment is that of the Abbé de Rothelin, _Observations\r\net détails sur la collection des voyages_, etc. (Paris, 1742), pp.\r\n44 (Carter-Brown, vol. i. no. 473), which is reprinted in Lenglet du\r\nFresnoy’s _Méthode pour étudier la géographie_ (1768), i. 324. Gabriel\r\nMartin, in his catalogue of the library of M. Cisternay du Fay, had\r\nsomewhat earlier announced that collector’s triumph in calling a set in\r\nhis catalogue (no. 2,825) “exemplum omni genere perfectum,” when his\r\ncopy brought 450 francs. The Abbé de Rothelin aimed to exceed Cisternay\r\ndu Fay, and did in the varieties which he brought together. The next\r\ndescription was that of De Bure in his _Bibliographie instructive_\r\n(vol. i. p. 67), printed 1763-1768; but the German editions were\r\noverlooked by De Bure, as they had been by his predecessors. The\r\n_Carter-Brown Catalogue_ (vol. i. no. 473) shows Sobolewski’s copy of\r\nDe Bure with manuscript notes. A lifetime later, in 1802, A. G. Camus\r\nprinted at Paris his _Mémoire sur les grands et petits voyages_ [de De\r\nBry] _et les voyages de Thevenot_. As a careful and critical piece of\r\nwork, this collation of Camus was superior to De Bure’s. A description\r\nof a copy belonging to the Duke of Bedford was printed in Paris in\r\n1836 (6 pp.). Weigel, in the _Serapeum_ (1845), pp. 65-89, printed his\r\n“Bibliographische Mittheilungen über die deutschen Ausgaben von De\r\nBry,” which was also printed separately. It described a copy now owned\r\nin New York. Muller, in his _Catalogue_ (1872), p. 217, indicates some\r\ndifferences from Weigel’s collations. The copy formed by De Bure fell\r\ninto Mr. Grenville’s hands, and was largely improved by him before he\r\nleft it, with his library, to the British Museum. The _Bibliotheca\r\nGrenvilliana_ describes it, and Bartlett (_Carter-Brown Catalogue_, i.\r\n321) thinks it the finest in Europe. Cf. Dibdin’s description, which\r\nis copied in the _American Bibliopolist_ (1872), p. 13. The standard\r\ncollation at present is probably that of Brunet, in his _Manuel du\r\nlibraire_, vol. i. (1860), which was also printed separately; in this\r\nhe follows Weigel for the German texts. This account is followed by\r\nSabin in his _Dictionary_ (vol. iii. p. 20), whose article, prepared\r\nby Charles A. Cutter, of the Boston Athenæum, has also been printed\r\nseparately. The Brunet account is accompanied by a valuable note\r\n(also in Sabin, iii. 59), by Sobolewski, whose best set (reaching one\r\nhundred and seventy parts) was a wonderful one, though he lacked the\r\nEnglish Hariot. This set came to this country through Muller (cf.\r\nhis _Catalogue_, 1875, p. 387), and is now in the Lenox Library.\r\nSobolewski’s second set went into the Field Collection, and was sold\r\nin 1875; and again in the J. J. Cooke sale (_Catalogue_, iii. 297) in\r\n1883. Cf. _Catalogue de la collection de feu M. Serge Sobolewski de\r\nMoscou_, prepared by Albert Cohn. The sale took place in Leipsic in\r\nJuly, 1873. Brunet and Sobolewski both point out the great difficulties\r\nof a satisfactory collation, arising from the publisher’s habit of\r\nmixing the sheets of the various editions, forming varieties almost\r\nbeyond the acquisition of the most enthusiastic collector, “so that,”\r\nsays Brunet, “perhaps no two copies of this work are exactly alike.”\r\n“No man ever yet,” says Henry Stevens (_Historical Collections_, vol.\r\ni. no. 179), “made up his De Bry perfect, if one may count on the three\r\ngreat De Bry witnesses,—the Right Honorable Thomas Grenville, the\r\nRussian prince Sobolewski, and the American Mr. Lenox,—who all went far\r\nbeyond De Bure, yet fell far short of attaining all the variations they\r\nhad heard of.” The collector will value various other collations now\r\naccessible, like that in the _Carter-Brown Catalogue_, vol. i. no. 396\r\n(also printed separately, twenty-five copies, in 1875); that printed by\r\nQuaritch, confined to the German texts; that in the _Huth Catalogue_,\r\nii. 404; and that in the _Sunderland Catalogue_, nos. 2,052, 2,053.\r\n\r\n[202] There are lists of the sets which have been sold since 1709 given\r\nin Sabin (vol. iii. p. 47), from Brunet, and in the _Carter-Brown\r\nCatalogue_ (vol. i. p. 408). The Rothelin copy, then esteemed the best\r\nknown, brought, in 1746, 750 francs. At a later day, with additions\r\nsecured under better knowledge, it again changed hands at 2,551 francs,\r\nand once more, in 1855 (described in the _Bulletin du bibliophile_,\r\n1855, pp. 38-41), Mr. Lenox bought it for 12,000 francs; and in 1873\r\nMr. Lenox also bought the best Sobolewski copy (fifty-five volumes) for\r\n5,050 thalers. With these and other parts, procured elsewhere, this\r\nlibrary is supposed to lead all others in the facilities for a De Bry\r\nbibliography. Fair copies of the _Grands voyages_ in Latin, in first or\r\nsecond editions, are usually sold for about £100, and for both voyages\r\nfor £150, and sometimes £200. Muller, in 1872, held the fourteen parts,\r\nin German, of the _Grands voyages_, at 1,000 florins. Fragmentary sets\r\nare frequently in the Catalogues, but bring proportionately much less\r\nprices. In unusually full sets the appreciation of value is rapid with\r\nevery additional part. Most large American libraries have sets of more\r\nor less completeness. Besides those in the Carter-Brown (which took\r\nthirty years to make, besides a duplicate set from the Sobolewski sale)\r\nand Lenox libraries, there are others in the Boston Public, Harvard\r\nCollege, Astor, and Long Island Historical Society libraries,—all of\r\nfair proportions, and not unfrequently in duplicate and complemental\r\nsets. The copy of the Great Voyages, in Latin (all first editions), in\r\nthe Murphy Library (_Catalogue_, no. 379), was gathered for Mr. Murphy\r\nby Obadiah Rich. The Murphy Library also contained the German text in\r\nfirst editions. In 1884 Quaritch offered the fine set from the Hamilton\r\nLibrary (twenty-five parts), “presumed to be quite perfect,” for £670.\r\nThe Earl of Crawford and Balcarres is about publishing his bibliography\r\nof De Bry.\r\n\r\n[203] There are somewhat diverse views on this point expressed by\r\nBrunet and in the Grenville Catalogue.\r\n\r\n[204] Reference has been made elsewhere (Vol. III. pp. 123, 164) to\r\nsketches, now preserved as a part of the Grenville copy of De Bry in\r\nthe British Museum, which seem to have been the originals from which De\r\nBry engraved the pictures in Hariot’s _Virginia_, etc. These were drawn\r\nby Wyth, or White. A collection of twenty-four plates of such, from De\r\nBry, were published in New York in 1841 (_Field’s Indian Bibliography_,\r\nno. 1,701). Cf. _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, Oct. 20, 1866, for other of\r\nDe Bry’s drawings in the British Museum. De Bry’s engravings have been\r\nsince copied by Picard in his _Cérémonies et coutumes religieuses des\r\npeuples idolatres_ (Amsterdam, 1723), and by others. Exception is taken\r\nto the fidelity of De Bry’s engravings in the parts on Columbus; cf.\r\nNavarrete, French translation, i. 320.\r\n\r\n[205] Carter-Brown, vol. i. nos. 453, 454, 455.\r\n\r\n[206] Rich (1832), £5 5_s._ Cf.

A. Elton,\r\n2d ed. London, 1815.)\r\n\r\nCritics differ as to the age of the vivid description of Tartarus in\r\nthe Theogony.\r\n\r\n[260] Pythagoras has left no writings; Aristotle speaks only of his\r\nschool; Diogenes Laertius in one passage (_Vitae_, viii. 1 (Pythag.),\r\n25) quotes an authority to the effect that Pythagoras asserted the\r\nearth to be spherical and inhabited all over, so that there were\r\nantipodes, to whom that is _over_ which to us is _under_. As all his\r\ndisciples agreed on the spherical form of the earth while differing\r\nas to its position and motion, it is probable that they took the idea\r\nof its form from him. Diogenes Laertius states that Parmenides called\r\nthe earth round (_στρογγύλη_, viii. 48), and also that he spoke of it\r\nas spherical (_σφαιροειδῆ_, ix. 3); the passages are not, as has been\r\nsometimes assumed, contradictory. The enunciation of the doctrine is\r\noften attributed to Thales and to Anaximander, on the authority of\r\nPlutarch, _De placitis philosophorum_, iii. 10, and Diogenes Laertius,\r\nii. 1, respectively; but the evidence is conflicting (Simplicius,\r\n_Ad Aristot._, p. 506^b. ed. Brandis; Aristot., _De caelo_, ii. 13;\r\nPlutarch, _De plac. phil._ iii., xv. 9).\r\n\r\n[261] Plato, _Phaedo_, 109. Schaefer is in error when he asserts\r\n(_Entwicklung der Ansichten der Alten ueber Gestalt and Grösse der\r\nErde_, 16) that Plato in the _Timaeus_ (55, 56) assigns a cubical form\r\nto the earth. The question there is not of the shape of the earth, the\r\nplanet, but of the form of the constituent atoms of the element earth.\r\n\r\n[262]\r\n\r\nTerra pilae similis, nullo fulcimine nixa, Aëre subjecto tam grave\r\npendet onus.

The last lines refer to\r\na globe said to have been constructed by Archimedes.\r\n\r\n[263] Plato makes Socrates say that he took up the works of Anaxagoras,\r\nhoping to learn whether the earth was round or flat (_Phaedo_, 46,\r\nStallb. i. 176). In Plutarch’s dialogue “_On the face appearing in the\r\norb of the moon_,” one of the characters is lavish in his ridicule of\r\nthe sphericity of the earth and of the theory of antipodes. See also\r\nLucretius, _De rerum nat._, i. 1052, etc., v. 650; Virgil, _Georgics_,\r\ni. 247; Tacitus, _Germania_, 45.\r\n\r\n[264] That extraordinary picture could, however, hardly have been\r\nintended for an exposition of the actual physical geography of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n[265] Aristotle, _De caelo_, ii. 15.\r\n\r\n[266] Archimedes, _Arenarius_, i. 1, ed.

The majority of\r\nancient writers who treat of the matter give 252,000 stadia as the\r\nresult, but Cleomedes (_Circ. doctr. de subl._, i. 10) gives 250,000.\r\nIt is surmised that the former number originated in a desire to assign\r\nin round numbers 700 stadia to a degree. Forbiger, _Handbuch der alten\r\nGeographie_, i. 180, n. 27.\r\n\r\n[268] The stadium comprised six hundred feet, but the length of the\r\nGreek foot is uncertain; indeed, there were at least two varieties, the\r\nOlympic and the Attic, as in Egypt there was a royal and a common ell,\r\nand a much larger number of supposititious feet (and, consequently,\r\nstadia) have been discovered or invented by metrologists. Early French\r\nscholars, like Ramé de l’Isle, D’Anville, Gosselin, supposed the true\r\nlength of the earth’s circumference to be known to the Greeks, and held\r\nthat all the estimates which have come down to us were expressions\r\nof the same value in different stadia. It is now generally agreed\r\nthat these estimates really denote different conceptions of the size\r\nof the earth, but opinions still differ widely as to the length of\r\nthe stadium used by the geographers. The value selected by Peschel\r\n(_Geschichte der Erdkunde_, 2d ed., p. 46) is that likewise adopted\r\nby Hultsch (_Griechische und Römische Metrologie_, 2d ed., 1882) and\r\nMuellenhof (_Deutsche Alterthumskunde_, 2d ed., vol. i.). According to\r\nthese writers, Eratosthenes is supposed to have devised as a standard\r\ngeographical measure a stadium composed of feet equal to one half\r\nthe royal Egyptian ell. According to Pliny (_Hist. Nat._, xii. 14, §\r\n5), Eratosthenes allowed forty stadia to the Egyptian schonus; if we\r\nreckon the schonus at 12,000 royal ells, we have stadium = 12,000/40\r\n× .525^m = 157.5^m. This would give a degree equal to 110,250^m, the\r\ntrue value being, according to Peschel, 110,808^m. To this conclusion\r\nLepsius (_Das Stadium und die Gradmessung des Eratosthenes auf\r\nGrundlage der Aegyptischen Masse_, in _Zeitschrift für Aegypt. Sprache\r\nu. Alterthumskunde_, xv. [1877]. See also _Die Längenmasse der Alten_.\r\nBerlin, 1884) objects that the royal ell was never used in composition,\r\nand that the schonus was valued in different parts of Egypt at 12,000,\r\n16,000, 24,000, _small_ ells. He believes that the schonus referred to\r\nby Pliny contained 16,000 small ells, so that Eratosthenes’s stadium =\r\n16,000/40 × .450^m = 180^m.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, however, that Eratosthenes did not devise a new\r\nstadium, but adopted that in current use among the Greeks, the Athenian\r\nstadium. (I have seen no evidence that the long Olympic stadium was\r\nin common use.) This stadium is based on the Athenian foot, which,\r\naccording to the investigations of Stuart, has been reckoned at\r\n.3081^m, being to the Roman foot as 25 to 24. This would give a stadium\r\nof 184.8^m, and a degree of 129,500^m. Now Strabo, in the passage where\r\nhe says that people commonly estimated eight stadia to the mile, adds\r\nthat Polybius allowed 8⅓ stadia to the mile (_Geogr._, vii. 7, § 4),\r\nand in the fragment known as the Table of Julian of Ascalon (Hultsch,\r\n_Metrolog. script. reliq._, Lips., 1864, i. 201) it is distinctly\r\nstated that Eratosthenes and Strabo reckoned 8⅓ stadia to the mile. In\r\nthe opinion of Hultsch, this table probably belonged to an official\r\ncompilation made under the emperor Julian. Very recently W. Dörpfeld\r\nhas revised the work of Stuart, and by a series of measurements of the\r\nsmaller architectural features in Athenian remains has made it appear\r\nthat the Athenian foot equalled .2957^m (instead of .3081^m), which\r\nis almost precisely the Roman foot, and gives a stadium of 177.4^m,\r\nwhich runs 8⅓ to the Roman mile. If this revision is trustworthy,—and\r\nit has been accepted by Lepsius and by Nissel (who contributes\r\nthe article on metrology to Mueller’s _Handbuch der klassischen\r\nAlterthumswissenschaft_, Nordlingen, 1886, etc.),—it seems to me\r\nprobable that we have here the stadium used by Eratosthenes, and that\r\nhis degree has a value of 124,180^m (Dörpfeld, _Beiträge zur antiken\r\nMetrologie, in Mittheilungen des deutschen Archaeolog. Instituts zu\r\nAthen_, vii. (1882), 277).\r\n\r\n[269] Strabo, _Geogr._, ii. 5, § 7; the estimate of Posidonius is only\r\nquoted hypothetically by Strabo (ii. 2, § 2).\r\n\r\n[270] Pliny, _Hist. Nat._ ii. 112, 113. There is apparently some\r\nmisunderstanding, either on the part of Pliny or his copyists, in the\r\nsubsequent proposition to increase this estimate by 12,000 stadia.\r\nSchaefer’s (_Philologus_, xxviii. 187) readjustment of the text is\r\nrather audacious. Pliny’s statement that Hipparchus estimated the\r\ncircumference at 275,000 stadia does not agree with Strabo (i. 4, § 1).\r\n\r\n[271] The discrepancy is variously explained. Riccioli, in his\r\n_Geographia et hydrographia reformata_, 1661, first suggested the more\r\ncommonly received solution. Posidonius, he thought, having calculated\r\nthe arc between Rhodes and Alexandria at 1-48 of the circumference, at\r\nfirst assumed 5,000 stadia as the distance between these places: 5,000\r\n× 48 = 240,000. Later he adopted a revised estimate of the distance\r\n(Strabo, ii, ch. v. § 24), 3,750 stadia: 3,750 × 48 = 180,000. Letronne\r\n(_Mém. de l’Acad. des Inscr. et Belles-Lettres_, vi., 1822) prefers\r\nto regard both numbers as merely hypothetical illustrations of the\r\nprocesses. Hultsch (_Griechische u. Römische Metrologie_, 1882, p. 63)\r\nfollows Fréret and Gosselin in regarding both numbers as expressing\r\nthe same value in stadia of different length (Forbiger, _Handbuch der\r\nalten Geographie_, i. 360, n. 29). The last explanation is barred by\r\nthe positive statement of Strabo, who can hardly be thought not to have\r\nknown what he was talking about: _κἄν τῶν νεωτέρων δὲ ἀναμετρήσεων\r\nεἰσάγηται ἡ ἐλαχίστην ποιόυσα τὴν γῆν, οἵαν ὁ Ποσειδώνιος ἐγκρίνει περὶ\r\nὀκτωκαίδεκα μυριάδας οὖσαν_, (_Geogr._, ii. 2, § 2.)\r\n\r\n[272] _Geographia_, vii. 5.\r\n\r\n[273] 1° = 500 stadia = 88,700^m, which is about one fifth smaller than\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\n[274] Xenophanes is to be excepted, if, as M. Martin supposes, his\r\ndoctrine of the infinite extent of the earth applied to its extent\r\nhorizontally as well as downward.\r\n\r\n[275] The domain of early Greek geography has not escaped the\r\nincursions of unbalanced investigators. The Greeks themselves allowed\r\nthe Argonauts an ocean voyage: Crates and Strabo did valiant battle for\r\nthe universal wisdom of Homer; nor are scholars lacking to-day who will\r\ndemonstrate that Odysseus had circumnavigated Africa, floated in the\r\nshadow of Teneriffe—Horace to the contrary notwithstanding,—or sought\r\nand found the north pole. The evidence is against such vain imaginings.\r\nThe world of Homer is a narrow world; to him the earth and the Ægean\r\nSea are alike boundless, and in his thought fairy-land could begin west\r\nof the Lotos-eaters, and one could there forget the things of this\r\nlife. There is little doubt that the author of the Odyssey considered\r\nGreece an island, and Asia and Africa another, and thought the great\r\nocean eddied around the north of Hellas to a union with the Euxine.\r\n\r\n[276]\r\n\r\nQuinque tenent caelum zonae: quarum una corusco Semper sole rubens, et\r\ntorrida semper ab igni; Quam circum extremae dextra laevaque trahuntur\r\nCaeruleae glacie concretae atque imbribus atris; Has inter mediam duae\r\nmortalibus aegris Munere concessae divom.\r\n\r\n(Virgil, _Georg._ i. 233.)\r\n\r\nThe passage appears to be paraphrased from similar lines which are\r\npreserved in Achilles Tatius (_Isag. in Phænom. Arat._; Petavius,\r\n_Uranolog._ p. 153), and by him attributed to the _Hermes_ of\r\nEratosthenes.

The\r\ntheory which he built upon this reconstructed foundation so impressed\r\nHumboldt that he changed his opinion as to the views of Aristotle on\r\nthis point (_Examen critique_, ii. 373). Such an emendation is only\r\njustifiable by the sternest necessity, and it has been shown by Ruge\r\n(_Der Chaldäer Seleukos_, Dresden, 1865), and Prantl (_Werke des\r\nAristoteles uebersetzt und erläutert_, Bd. ii.; _Die Himmelsgebäude_,\r\nnote 61), that neither sense nor consistency requires the change.\r\n\r\n[278] Herodotus, ii. 23; iii. 115; iv. 36, 40, 45.\r\n\r\n[279] Geminus, _Isagoge_.

The second class\r\nincluded such peoples as lived in the same temperate zone, but were\r\ndivided by half the circumference of that zone; so that while they\r\nall had summer or winter at the same time, the one group had day when\r\nthe other had night, and _vice versa_. These groups could call one\r\nanother _περίοικοι_ according to Cleomedes, but _ἀντίχθονες_ according\r\nto Tatius. 3. The third class included those who were divided by the\r\ntorrid zone, so that part lived in the northern temperate zone and part\r\nin the southern, but yet so that all were in the same half of their\r\nrespective zones; _i. e._, all were in either the eastern or western,\r\nupper or lower, hemisphere. Day and night were shared by the whole\r\nclass at once, but not the seasons, the northern group having summer\r\nwhen the southern had winter, and _vice versa_. These groups could call\r\none another _ἄντοικοι_. 4. The fourth class comprised the groups which\r\nwe know as antipodes, dwelling with regard to one another in different\r\nhalves of the two temperate zones, so that they had neither seasons nor\r\nday or night in common, but stood upon the globe diametrically opposed\r\nto one another. All writers agree in calling these groups _ἀντίποδες_.\r\nThe introduction of the word _antichthones_ in place of _perioeci_ was\r\ndue, apparently, to a misunderstanding of the Pythagorean _antichthon_.\r\nThis name was properly applied to the imaginary planet invented by the\r\nearly Pythagoreans to bring the number of the spheres up to ten; it\r\nwas located between the earth and the central fire, and had the same\r\nperiod of revolution as the earth, from the outer, Grecian, side of\r\nwhich it was never visible. This “opposite earth,” _Gegenerde_, was\r\nlater confused with the other, western, or lower hemisphere of the\r\nearth itself. It was also sometimes applied to the inhabitants of the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, as by Cicero in the _Tusculan Disputations_ (i.\r\n28), “duabus oris distantibus habitabilem et cultum; quarum altera quam\r\nnos incolimus,\r\n\r\n  Sub axe posita ad stellas septem unde horrifer\r\n  Aquiloni stridor gelidas molitur nives,\r\n\r\naltera australis, ignota nobis, _quam vocant Græci_ _ἀντίχθονα_.” Mela\r\nhas the same usage (i. 4, 5), as quoted below. Macrobius, _Comm. in\r\nSomn. Scip._ lib. ii. 5, uses the nomenclature of Cleomedes. Reinhardt,\r\nquoted in Engelmann’s _Bibliotheca classica Græca_, under Geminus, I\r\nhave not been able to see.\r\n\r\n[284] Strabo, i. 4, § 6, 7; i. 2, § 24.

Haec\r\nergo ab ortu porrecta ad occasum, et quia sic iacet aliquanto quam\r\nubi latissima est longior, ambitur omnis oceano. Mela, _Chor._, i.\r\n4, 5. Because Mela says that the known world is _but little_ longer\r\nthan its width, it has been supposed that he was better informed than\r\nhis contemporaries, and attributed something like its real extent\r\nto Africa. Thomassy (_Les papes géographiques_, Paris, 1852, p. 17)\r\nfinds in his work a rival system to that of Ptolemy. The discovery\r\nof America, he thinks, was due to Ptolemy; that of the Cape of Good\r\nHope to Mela. It was the good fortune of Mela that his work was\r\nwidely read in the Middle Ages, and had great influence; but we owe\r\nhim no new system of geography, since he simply adopted the oceanic\r\ntheory as represented by Strabo and Crates. That he slightly changed\r\nthe traditional proportion between the length and breadth of the\r\nknown world is of small importance. The known world, he states, was\r\nsurrounded by the ocean, and there is nothing to show that he supposed\r\nAfrica to extend below the equator. In his description of Africa\r\nhe applies the terms length and breadth not as we should, but with\r\ncontrary usage: “Africa ab orientis parte Nilo terminata, pelago a\r\nceteris, brevior est quidem quam Europa, quia nec usquam Asiae et non\r\ntotis huius litoribus obtenditur, longior tamen ipsa quam latior, et\r\nqua ad fluvium adtingit latissima,” etc., i. 20.

Scipionis_, ii. 5.—“Cernis autem eamdem\r\nterram quasi quibusdam redimitam et circumdatam cingulis, e quibus\r\nduos maxime inter se diversos, et caeli verticibus ipsis ex utraque\r\nparte subnixos, obriguisse pruina vides; medium autem illum, et\r\nmaximum, solis ardore torreri. Duo sunt habitabiles: quorum australis\r\nille, in quo qui insistunt, adversa vobis urgent vestigia, nihil ad\r\nvestrum genus; hic autem alter subjectus aquiloni, quem incolitis,\r\ncerne quam tenui vos parte contingat. Omnis enim terra, quae colitur\r\na vobis, angusta verticibus, lateribus latior, parva quaedam insula\r\nest....” (Cicero.) ... Nam et septentrionalis et australis extremitas\r\nperpetua obriguerunt pruina.... Horum uterque habitationis impatiens\r\nest.... Medius cingulus et ideo maximus, aeterno afflatu continui\r\ncaloris ustus, spatium quod et lato ambitu et prolixius occupavit,\r\nnimietate fervoris facit inhabitabile victuris. Inter extremos vero\r\net medium duo majores ultimis, medio minores ex utriusque vicinitatis\r\nintemperie temperantur.... Licet igitur sint hae duae ... quas diximus\r\ntemperatas, non tamen ambae zonae hominibus nostri generis indultae\r\nsunt: sed sola superior, ... incolitur ab omni, quale scire possumus,\r\nhominum genere, Romani Graecive sint, vel barbari cujusque nationis.\r\nIlla vero ... sola ratione intelligitur, quod propter similem temperiem\r\nsimiliter incolatur, sed a quibus, neque licuit unquam nobis nec\r\nlicebit cognoscere: interjecta enim torrida utrique hominum generi\r\ncommercium ad se denegat commeandi.... Nec dubium est, nostrum quoque\r\nseptentrionem [ventum] ad illos qui australi adjacent, propter eamdem\r\nrationem calidum pervenire, et austrum corporibus eorum gemino aurae\r\nsuae rigore blandiri. Eadem ratio nos non permittit ambigere quin per\r\nillam quoque superficiem terrae quae ad nos habetur inferior, integer\r\nzonarum ambitus quae hic temperatae sunt, eodem ductu temperatus\r\nhabeatur; atque ideo illic quoque eaedem duae zonae a se distantes\r\nsimiliter incolantur.... Nam si nobis vivendi facultas est in hac\r\nterrarum parte quam colimus, quia, calcantes humum, caelum suspicimus\r\nsuper verticem, quia sol nobis et oritur et occidit, quia circumfuso\r\nfruimur aere cujus spiramus haustu, cur non et illic aliquos vivere\r\ncredamus ubi eadem semper inpromptu sunt? Nam, qui ibi dicuntur morari,\r\neamdem credendi sunt spirare auram, quia eadem est in ejusdem zonalis\r\nambitus continuatione temperies. Idem sol illis et obire dicitur nostro\r\nortu, et orietur quum nobis occidet: calcabunt aeque ut nos humum, et\r\nsupra verticem semper caelum videbunt. Nec metus erit ne de terra in\r\ncaelum decidant, quum nihil unquam possit ruere sursum. Si enim nobis,\r\nquod asserere genus joci est, deorsum habitur ubi est terra, et sursum\r\nubi est caelum, illis quoque sursum erit quod de inferiore suspicient,\r\nnec aliquando in superna casuri sunt.\r\n\r\nHi quos separat a nobis perusta, quos Graeci _ἀντοικοὑς_ vocant,\r\nsimiliter ab illis qui inferiorem zonae suae incolunt partem interjecta\r\naustrali gelida separantur. Rursus illos ab _ἀντοικοῖς_ suis, id\r\nest per nostri cinguli inferiora viventibus, interjectio ardentis\r\nsequestrat: et illi a nobis septentrionalis extremitatis rigore\r\nremoventur. Et quia non est una omnium affinis continuatio, sed\r\ninterjectae sunt solitudines ex calore vel frigore mutuum negantibus\r\ncommeatum, has terrae partes quae a quattuor hominum generibus\r\nincoluntur, maculas habitationum vocavit....\r\n\r\n9.

Ab oriente vero\r\nduos sinus refundit, unum ad extremitatem septentrionis, ad australis\r\nalterum: rursusque ab occidente duo pariter enascuntur sinus, qui usque\r\nad ambas, quas supra diximus, extremitates refusi occurrent ab oriente\r\ndemissis; et, dum vi summa et impetu immaniore miscentur, invicemque\r\nse feriunt, ex ipsa aquarum collisione nascitur illa famosa oceani\r\naccessio pariter et recessio.... Ceterum verior, ut ita dicam, ejus\r\nalveus tenet zonam perustam; et tam ipse qui equinoctialem, quam sinus\r\nex eo nati qui horizontem circulum ambitu suae flexionis imitantur,\r\nomnem terram quadrifidam dividunt, et singulas, ut supra diximus,\r\nhabitationes insulas faciunt ... binas in superiore atque inferiore\r\nterrae superficie insulas....\r\n\r\n[290] Mr. Gladstone (_Homer and the Homeric age_, vol. iii.) transposes\r\nthese Homeric localities to the east, and a few German writers agree\r\nwith him. President Warren (_True key to ancient cosmologies_, etc.,\r\nBoston, 1882) will have it that Ogygia is neither more nor less than\r\nthe north pole. Neither of these views is likely to displace the one\r\nnow orthodox. Mr. Gladstone is so much troubled by Odysseus’s course\r\non leaving Ogygia that he cannot hide a suspicion of corruption in the\r\ntext. President Warren should remember that Ogygia apparently enjoyed\r\nthe common succession of day and night. In Homeric thought the western\r\nsea extended northward and eastward until it joined the Euxine. Ogygia,\r\nlocated northwest of Greece, would be the centre, _omphalos_, of the\r\nsea, as Delphi was later called the centre of the land-masses of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[291] _Odyssey_, iv. 561, etc.\r\n\r\n[292] It is well known that whereas Odysseus meets the spirits of\r\nthe dead across Oceanus, upon the surface of the earth, there is in\r\nthe _Iliad_ mention of a subterranean Hades. The Assyrio-Babylonians\r\nhad also the idea of an earth-encircling ocean stream,—the word\r\n_Ὠκεανὸς_ the Greeks said was of foreign origin,—and on the south of\r\nit they placed the sea of the dead, which held the island homes of\r\nthe departed. As in the _Odyssey_, it was a place given over to dust\r\nand darkness, and the doors of it were strongly barred; no living\r\nbeing save a god or a chosen hero might come there.

Paley marks the line _Τηλοῦ ἀπ̓ ἀθανάτων τόισιν Κρόνος\r\nἐμβασιλζύει_ as probably spurious. Cronos appears to have been\r\noriginally a Phœnician deity, and his westward wandering played an\r\nimportant part in their mythology. We shall find further traces of this\r\ndivinity in the west.\r\n\r\n[294] Pindar, _Olymp._, ii. 66-85, Paley’s translation, London, 1868,\r\np. 12. See also Euripides, _Helena_, 1677.\r\n\r\n[295] Æschylus, in the _Prometheus bound_, introduced the Gorgon\r\nislands in his epitome of the wanderings of Io, and certainly seems to\r\nspeak of them as in the east; the passage is, however, imperfect, and\r\nits interpretation has overtasked the ablest commentators.\r\n\r\n[296] Euripides, _Hippolytus_, 742-751; Potter’s translation, i. p.\r\n356.

Pliny, who, beside the groups named in the\r\ntext, mentions the Gorgades, which he identifies with the place where\r\nHanno met the gorillas, has probably misunderstood and garbled his\r\nauthorities; his account is contradictory and illusive.\r\n\r\n[298] Tzetzes (_Scholia in Lycophron_, 1204, ed. Mueller, ii. 954), a\r\ngrammarian of the twelfth century, says that the Isles of the Blessed\r\nwere located in the ocean by Homer, Hesiod, Euripides, Plutarch, Dion,\r\nProcopius, Philostratus and others, but that to many it seems that\r\nBritain must be the true Isle of the Blessed; and in support of this\r\nview he relates a most curious tale of the ferriage of the dead to\r\nBritain by Breton fishermen.\r\n\r\n[299] _L’Atlantide_, by Paul Gaffarel, in the _Revue de Géographie_,\r\nApril, May, June, July, 1880 (vi. 241, 331, 421; vii. 21).

The extracts in the text are taken from “_A Registre of\r\nHystories, etc., written in Greeke by Aelianus, a Roman, and delivered\r\nin English by_ Abraham Fleming.” London, 1576, fol. 36.\r\n\r\n[302] We owe this quip to Tertullian (he at least is the earliest\r\nwriter to whom I can trace it): “Ut Silenus penes aures Midae blattit,\r\n_aptas sane grandioribus fabulis_” (_De pallio_, cap. 2).\r\n\r\n[303] “Furthermore he tolde one thing among all others, meriting\r\nadmiration, that certain men called Meropes dwelt in many cittyes\r\nthere about, and that in the borders adiacent to their countrey, was a\r\nperilous place named Anostus, that is to say, wythout retourne, being\r\na gaping gulfe or bottomles pit, for the ground is as it were cleft\r\nand rent in sonder, in so much that it openeth like to the mouth of\r\ninsatiable hell, y^t it is neither perfectly lightsome, nor absolutely\r\ndarksome, but that the ayer hangeth ouer it, being tempered with a\r\ncertaine kinde of clowdy rednes, that a couple of floodes set their\r\nrecourse that way, the one of pleasure the other of sorow, and that\r\nabout each of them growe plantes answearable in quantity and bignes\r\nto a great plaine tree. The trees which spring by y^e flood of sorow\r\nyeldeth fruite of one nature, qualitie, and operation. For if any man\r\ntaste thereof, a streame of teares floweth from his eyes, as out of a\r\nconduite pipe, or sluse in a running riuer, yea, such effect followeth\r\nimmediately after the eating of the same, that the whole race of their\r\nlife is turned into a tragical lamentation, in so much that weeping and\r\nwayling knitteth their carkeses depriued of vitall mouing, in a winding\r\nsheete, and maketh them gobbettes for the greedy graue to swallow and\r\ndeuoure. The other trees which prosper vpon the bankes of the floode\r\nof pleasure, beare fruite cleane contrary to the former, for whosoeuer\r\ntasteth thereof, he is presently weined from the pappes of his auncient\r\nappetites and inueterate desires, & if he were linked in loue to any\r\nin time past, he is fettered in the forgetfulnes of them, so that\r\nal remembrance is quite abolished, by litle and litle he recouereth\r\nthe yeres of his youth, reasuming vnto him by degrees, the times &\r\nseasons, long since, spent and gone. For, the frowardnes and crookednes\r\nof old age being first shaken of, the amiablenes and louelynesse of\r\nyouth beginneth to budde, in so much as they put on y^e estate of\r\nstripplings, then become boyes, then change to children, then reenter\r\ninto infancie, & at length death maketh a finall end of all.”\r\n\r\nCompare the story told by Mela (iii. 10) about the Fortunate Isles:\r\n“Una singulari duorum fontium ingenio maxime insignis: alterum qui\r\ngustavere risu solvuntur, ita adfectis remedium est ex altero bibere.”\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the country described by Theopompus is called\r\nby him simply “The Great Continent.”\r\n\r\n[304] Strabo, vii. 3, § 6. Perizonius makes this passage in Aelian\r\nthe peg for a long note on ancient knowledge of America, in which he\r\nbrings together the most important passages bearing on the subject. He\r\nremarks: “Nullus tamen dubito, quin Veteres aliquid crediderint vel\r\nsciverent, sed quasi per nebulam et caliginem, de America, partim ex\r\nantiqua traditione ab Aegyptiis vel Carthaginiensibus accepta, partim\r\nex ratiocinatione de forma et situ orbis terrarum, unde colligebant,\r\nsuperesse in hoc orbe etiam alias terras praeter Asiam, Africam, &\r\nEuropam.” In my opinion their assumed knowledge was based entirely on\r\nratiocination, and was not real knowledge at all; but Perizonius well\r\nexpresses the other view.\r\n\r\n[305] _Mare Cronium_ was the name given to a portion of the northern\r\nocean. Forbiger, _Handbuch_, ii. 3, note 9.\r\n\r\n[306] The average of all known rates of speed with ancient ships is\r\nabout five knots an hour; some of the fastest runs were at the rate of\r\nseven knots, or a little more. Breusing, _Nautik der Alten_, Bremen,\r\n1886, pp. 11, 12. Movers, _Die Phœnizier_, ii. 3, 190. Movers estimates\r\nthe rate of a Phœnician vessel with 180 oarsmen at double that of a\r\nGreek merchantman. He compares the sailing qualities of Phœnician\r\nvessels with those of Venice in the Middle Ages to the disadvantage of\r\nthe latter. As the ancients had nothing answering to our log, and their\r\ncontrivances for time-keeping were neither trustworthy nor adapted\r\nfor use on shipboard, these estimates are necessarily based on a few\r\nreports of the number of days spent on voyages of known length,—a\r\nrather uncertain method.\r\n\r\n[307] Tin exists in some of the islands of the Indian Ocean, and they\r\nwere worked at a later period, but there is no direct evidence, as far\r\nas I am aware, that they were known at the date when Tyre was most\r\nflourishing.\r\n\r\n[308] Diodorus Siculus, v. 18, 19; _De Mirab. Auscult._, 84. Müllenhof,\r\n_Deutsche Alterthumskunde_, i., Berlin, 1870, p. 467, traces the report\r\nthrough the historian Timaeus to Punic sources.\r\n\r\n[309] The narration of Hanno’s voyage has been preserved, apparently\r\nin the words of the commander’s report. _Geographi Graeci minores_,\r\ned. Mueller (Paris, 1855), i. pp. 1-14. Cf. also _Prolegom._, pp.\r\nxviii, xxiii. Our only notion of the date of the expedition is derived\r\nfrom Pliny, _Hist. Nat._, v. i. § 7, who says: “Fuere et Hannonis\r\nCarthaginiensium ducis commentarii, _Punicis rebus florentissimis_\r\nexplorare ambitum Africae jussi.” All that is known of Himilko is\r\nderived from the statement of Pliny, _Hist. Nat._, ii. 67, that he was\r\nsent at about the same time as Hanno to explore the distant regions of\r\nEurope; and from the poems of Avienus, who wrote in the fourth century,\r\nand professed to give, in the _Ora Maritima_, many extracts from the\r\nwritings of Himilko. The description of the difficulties of navigation\r\nin the Atlantic is best known. In his _Deutsche Alterthumskunde_\r\n(Berlin, 1870), i. pp. 73-210, Muellenhof has devoted especial\r\nattention to an analysis of this record.\r\n\r\n[310] Pliny, _Hist. Nat._, vi. 36, 37; Mela, iii. 100, etc.; Solinus,\r\n23, 56 [ed. Mommsen, p. 117, 230]; Ptolemy, _Geogr._, iv. 6; _Rapport\r\nsur une mission scientifique dans l’archipel Canarienne,_ par M.\r\nle docteur Verneau; 1877. In _Archives des Missions Scientifique\r\net Litteraires_, 3^e série, tom. xiii. pp. 569, etc. The presence\r\nof Semites is indicated in Gran Canaria, Ferro, Palma, and the\r\ninscriptions agree in character with those found in Numidia by Gen.\r\nFaidherbe. In Gomera and Teneriffe, where the Guanche stock is purest,\r\nthere have been no inscriptions found. Dr. Verneau believes that the\r\nGuanches are not descended from Atlantes or Americans, but from the\r\nQuaternary men of Cro-magnon on the Vézère; he found, however, traces\r\nof an unknown brachycephalic race in Gomera.\r\n\r\n[311] In the second century, a.d., Pausanias (_Desc. Graec._, i. 23)\r\nwas told by Euphemus, a Carian, that once, on a voyage to Italy, he had\r\nbeen driven to the sea outside [_ἐς τὲν ἔξω θάλασσαν_], where people\r\nno longer sailed, and where he fell in with many desert islands, some\r\ninhabited by wild men, red-haired, and with tails, whom the sailors\r\ncalled Satyrs. Nothing more is known of these islands. _Ἔξο_ has here\r\nbeen rendered simply “distant”; but even in this sense it could hardly\r\napply in the time of Pausanias to any region but the Atlantic. It is\r\nmore probable that the phrase means “outside the columns.”\r\n\r\nIn the first century B.C., some men of an unknown race were cast by\r\nthe sea on the German coast. There is nothing to show that these men\r\nwere American Indians; but since that has been sometimes assumed, the\r\nmatter should not be passed over here. The event is mentioned by Mela\r\n(_De Chorogr._, iii. 5, § 8), and by Pliny (_Hist. Nat._, ii. 67);\r\nthe castaways were forwarded to the proconsul, Q. Caecilius Metellus\r\nCeler (B.C. 62), by the king of the tribe within whose territory they\r\nwere found. Pliny calls the tribe the Suevi; the reading in Mela is\r\nvery uncertain. Parthey has _Botorum_, the older editors _Baetorum_,\r\nor _Boiorum_. The Romans took them for inhabitants of India, who had\r\nbeen carried around the north of Europe; modern writers have seen in\r\nthem Africans, Celts, Lapps, or Caribs. A careful study of the whole\r\nsubject, with references to the literature, will be found in an article\r\nby F. Schiern: _Un énigme ethnographique de l’antiquité_, contributed\r\nto the Memoirs of the Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries; New\r\nSeries, 1878-83, pp. 245-288.\r\n\r\nIn the Louvre is an antique bronze which has been thought to represent\r\none of the Indians of Mela, and also to be a good reproduction of the\r\nfeatures of the North American Indian (Longpérier, _Notice des bronzes\r\nantiques_, etc., _du Musée du Louvre_, Paris, 1868, p. 143), but the\r\nsupposition is purely arbitrary.\r\n\r\nSuch an event as an involuntary voyage from the West Indies to the\r\nshores of Europe is not an impossibility, nor is the case cited by\r\nMela and Pliny the only one of the kind which we find recorded. Gomara\r\n(_Hist. gen. de las Indias_, 7) says some savages were thrown upon\r\nthe German coast in the reign of Frederic Barbarossa (1152-1190),\r\nand Aeneas Silvius (Pius II.) probably refers to the same event when\r\nhe quotes a certain Otho as relating the capture on the coast of\r\nGermany, in the time of the German emperors, of an Indian ship and\r\nIndian traders (mercatores). The identity of Otho is uncertain. Otto\r\nof Freisingen ([Dagger] 1158) is probably meant, but the passage does\r\nnot appear in his works that have been preserved (Aeneas Silvius,\r\n_Historia rerum_, ii. 8, first edition, Venice, 1477). The most curious\r\nstory, however, is that related by Cardinal Bembo in his history of\r\nVenice (first published 1551), and quoted by Horn (_De orig. Amer._,\r\n14), Garcia (iv. 29), and others. It deserves, however, record here.\r\n“A French ship while cruising in the ocean not far from Britain picked\r\nup a little boat made of split oziers and covered with bark taken\r\nwhole from the tree; in it were seven men of moderate height, rather\r\ndark complexion, broad and open faces, marked with a violet scar.\r\nThey had a garment of fishskin with spots of divers shades, and wore\r\na headgear of painted straw, interwoven with seven things like ears,\r\nas it were (coronam e culmo pictam septem quasi auriculis intextam).\r\nThey ate raw flesh, and drank blood as we wine. Their speech could not\r\nbe understood. Six of them died; one, a youth, was brought alive to\r\nRoano (so the Italian; the Latin has Aulercos), where the king was”\r\n(Louis XII.). Bembo, _Rerum Venetarum Hist._ vii. year, 1508. [_Opere_,\r\nVenice, 1729, i. 188.]\r\n\r\n[312]\r\n\r\nNos manet Oceanus circumvagus; arva, beata\r\nPetamus arva, divites et insulas,\r\nReddit ubi Cererem tellus inarata quotannis\r\nEt inputata floret usque vinea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNon huc Argoo contendit remige pinus, Neque inpudica Colchis intulit\r\npedem; _Non huc Sidonii torserunt cornua nautae_, Laboriosa nec cohors\r\nUlixei. Juppiter illa piae secrevit litora genti, Ut inquinavit aere\r\ntempus aureum; Aere, dehinc ferro duravit saecula, quorum Piis secunda,\r\nvate me, datur fuga.\r\n\r\n(Horace, _Epode_, xvi.)\r\n\r\nVirgil, in the well-known lines in the prophecy of Anchises—\r\n\r\nSuper et Garamantes et Indos Proferet inperium; iacet extra sidera\r\ntellus, Extra anni solisque vias, ubi caelifer Atlas Axem humero\r\ntorquet stellis ardentibus aptum—\r\n\r\n(_Æneid_, vi. 795.)\r\n\r\nhad Africa rather than the west in mind, according to the commentators.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the islands described to Sertorius were Madeira and\r\nPorto Santo, but the distance was much overestimated in this case.\r\n\r\n[313] “He [Eratosthenes] says that if the extent of the Atlantic Ocean\r\nwere not an obstacle, we might easily pass by sea from Iberia to India,\r\nstill keeping in the same parallel, the remaining portion of which\r\nparallel ... occupies more than a third of the whole circle.... But\r\nit is quite possible that in the temperate zone there may be two or\r\neven more habitable earths _οἰκουμένας_, especially near the circle\r\nof latitude which is drawn through Athens and the Atlantic ocean.”\r\n(Strabo, _Geogr._, i. 4, § 6.)\r\n\r\n[314] Seneca, _Naturalium Quaest. Praefatio._ The passage is certainly\r\nstriking, but those who, like Baron Zach, base upon it the conclusion\r\nthat American voyagers were common in the days of Seneca overestimate\r\nits force. It is certainly evident that Seneca, relying on his\r\nknowledge of theoretical geography, underestimated the distance to\r\nIndia. Had the length of the voyage to America been known, he would not\r\nhave used the illustration.\r\n\r\n[315] Smaller vessels even than were then afloat have crossed the\r\nAtlantic, and the passage from the Canaries is hardly more difficult\r\nthan the Indian navigation. The Pacific islanders make voyages of\r\ndays’ duration by the stars alone to goals infinitely smaller than the\r\nbroadside of Asia, to which the ancients would have supposed themselves\r\naddressed.\r\n\r\n[316] Aristotle, _Meteorolog._, ii. 1, § 14; Plato, _Timaeus_; Scylax\r\nCaryandensis, _Periplus_, 112. _τῆς Κέρνης δὲ νέσου τὰ ἐπέκεινα οὐκέτι\r\nἐστὶ πλωτὰ διὰ βραχύτητα θαλάττης καὶ πελὸν καὶ φῦκος_(_Geogr.

A\r\ngloss to Suidas applies the name Atlantic to all innavigable seas.\r\nPausanias, i. ch. 3, § 6, says it contained strange sea-beasts, and was\r\nnot navigable in its more distant parts. A long list of references to\r\nsimilar passages is given by Ukert, _Geogr. der Griechen u. Römer_, ii.\r\n1, p. 59.

The Phœnicians are said to have\r\ndiscovered beyond Gades extensive shoals abounding in fish.\r\n\r\nQuae Himilco Poenus mensibus vix quatuor, Ut ipse semet re probasse\r\nretulit Enavigantem, posse transmitti adserit: Sic nulla late flabra\r\npropellunt ratem, Sic segnis humor aequoris pigri stupet. Adjecit et\r\nillud, plurimum inter gurgites Extare fucum, et saepe virgulti vice\r\nRetinere puppim: dicit hic nihilominus, Non in profundum terga dimitti\r\nmaris, Parvoque aquarum vix supertexi solum: Obire semper huc et huc\r\nponti feras, Navigia lenta et languide repentia Internatare belluas.\r\n(Avienus, _Ora Maritima_, 115-130.)\r\n\r\nHunc usus olim dixit Oceanum vetus, Alterque dixit mos Atlanticum mare.\r\nLongo explicatur gurges hujus ambitu, Produciturque latere prolixe\r\nvago.

Haec olim Himilcos Poenus Oceano super\r\nSpectasse semet et probasse retulit: Haec nos, ab imis Punicorum\r\nannalibus Prolata longo tempore, edidimus tibi. (_Ibid._ 402-415.)\r\n\r\nWhether Avienus had immediate knowledge of these Punic sources is quite\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n[318] Seneca, _Medea_, 376-380.\r\n\r\n[319] In the first book of his _Suasoriæ_, M. Annaeus Seneca collected\r\na number of examples illustrative of the manner in which several\r\nof the famous orators and rhetoricians of his time had handled the\r\nsubject, _Deliberat Alexander, an Oceanum naviget_, which appears to\r\nhave been one of a number of stock subjects for use in rhetorical\r\ntraining. This collection thus gives a good view of the prevalent\r\nviews about the ocean, and certainly tells strongly against the idea\r\nthat the western passage was then known or practised. “Fertiles in\r\nOceano jacere terras, ultraque Oceanum rursus alia littora, alium nasci\r\norbem, ... _facile ista finguntur; quia Oceanus navigari non potest_\r\n... confusa lux alta caligine, et interceptus tenebris dies, ipsum\r\nveros grave et devium mare, et aut nulla, aut ignota sidera. Ita est,\r\nAlexander, rerum natura; _post omnia Oceanus, post Oceanum nihil_....\r\nImmensum, et humanae intentatum experientiae pelagus, totius orbis\r\nvinculum, terrarumque custodia, inagitata remigio vastitas.... Fabianus\r\n... divisit enim illam [quaestionem] sic, ut primum negaret ullas in\r\nOceano, aut trans Oceanum, esse terras habitabiles: deinde si essent,\r\nperveniri tamen ad illas non posse. Hic difficultatem ignoti maris,\r\nnaturam non patientem navigationis.”\r\n\r\n[320] Virgil, bishop of Salzburg, was accused before Pope Zacharias\r\nby St. Boniface of teaching the doctrine of antipodes; for this, and\r\nnot for his belief in the sphericity of the earth (as I read), he was\r\nthreatened by the Pope with expulsion from the church. The authority\r\nfor this story is a letter from the Pope to Boniface. See Marinelli,\r\n_Die Erdkunde bei den Kirchenvätern_, p. 42.\r\n\r\n[321] Cosmas, as will be seen in the cut, adhered to the continental\r\ntheory, placing Paradise on the continent in the east. Paradise was\r\nmore commonly placed in an island east of Asia.\r\n\r\n[322] It has been suggested by M. Beauvois that Labrador may in\r\nthe same way derive its name from _Inis Labrada_, or the Island of\r\nLabraid, which figures in an ancient Celtic romance. The conjecture\r\nhas only the phonetic resemblance to recommend it. Beauvois, _L’Elysée\r\ntransatlantique (Revue de l’Histoire des Religions_, vii. (1883), p.\r\n291, n. 3).\r\n\r\n[323] Gaffarel, P., _Les isles fantastiques de l’Atlantique au moyen\r\nâge_, 3.\r\n\r\n[324] Coryat’s _Crudities_, London, 1611. Sig. h(4), verso.\r\n\r\n[325] The result of the Arabian measurements gave 56⅔3 miles to a\r\ndegree. Arabian miles were meant, and as these contain, according\r\nto Peschel (_Geschichte der Geographie_, p. 134) 4,000 ells of\r\n540.7^{mm}., the degree equalled 122,558.6^m. The Europeans, however,\r\nthought that Roman miles were meant, and so got but 83,866.6^m. to a\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\n[326] Edrisi, _Geography_, Climate, iv., § 1, Jaubert’s translation,\r\nParis, 1836, ii. 26.\r\n\r\n[327] Found in various Celtic MSS. See Beauvois, _L’Eden occidentale\r\n(Rev. de l’Hist. des Relig._), viii. (1884), 706, etc.; Joyce, _Old\r\nCeltic Romances_, 112-176.\r\n\r\n[328] These alleged voyages are considered in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[329] Polybius, _Hist._, iii. 38.\r\n\r\n[330] The tract _On the World_ (_περὶ κόσμου_, de mundo), and the\r\n_Strange Stories_ (_περὶθαυμασίων ἀκουσμάτν_, _de mirabilibus\r\nauscultationibus_), printed with the works of Aristotle, are held to\r\nbe spurious by critics: the former, which gives a good summary of\r\nthe oceanic theory of the distribution of land and water (ch. 3), is\r\nconsiderably later in date; the latter is a compilation made from\r\nAristotle and other writers. Muellenhof has sought partially to analyze\r\nit in his _Deutsche Alterthumskunde_, i. 426, etc.\r\n\r\n[331] First in _Geographica Marciani, Scylacis, Artemidoris, Dicæarchi,\r\nIsidori. Ed. a Hoeschelio_ (Aug. Vind., 1600). The great collection\r\nmade by Hudson, _Geographiae veteris scriptores Graeci minores_ (4\r\nvols., Oxon., 1698-1712; re-edited by Gail, Paris, 1826, 6 vols.), is\r\nstill useful, notwithstanding the handy edition by C. Mueller in the\r\nDidot classics, _Geographiae Graeci minores_ (Paris, 1855-61. 2 vols.\r\nand atlas).\r\n\r\n[332] _Fragmenta historicorum Graecorum. Ed. C. et T.

First edition of the Latin translation which was\r\nmade by Guarini of Verona, and Lilius Gregorius of Tiferno; only 275\r\ncopies were printed. It was reprinted in 1472 (Venice), 1473 (Rome),\r\n1480 (Tarvisii), 1494 (Venice), 1502 (Venice), 1510 (Venice), and 1512\r\n(Paris). _Strabo de situ orbis_ (Venice. Aldus et Andr. Soc., 1516),\r\nfol., was the first Greek edition; a better edition appeared in 1549\r\n(Basil., fol.), with Guarini’s and Gregorius’s translation revised by\r\nGlareanus and others. Critical ed. by J. Kramer (Berlin, 1844), 3 vols.\r\nEd. with Latin trans. by C. Müller and F. Dübner (Paris, Didot, 1853,\r\n1857). It has since been edited by August Meineke (Leipsic, Teubner,\r\n1866. 3 vols. 8vo).\r\n\r\nThere was an Italian translation by Buonacciuoli, in Venice and\r\nFerrara, 1562, 1585. 2 vols. The _Γεωγραφικὰ_ has been several\r\ntimes translated into German, by Penzel (Lemgo, 1775-1777, 4 Bde.\r\n8vo), Groskund (Berlin, Stettin, 1831-1834. 4 Thle.), and Forbiger\r\n(Stuttgart, 1856-1862. 2 Bde.), and very recently into English by H. C.\r\nHamilton and W. Falconer (London, Bell [Bohn], 1887). 3 vols. This has\r\na useful index.\r\n\r\nThe great French translation of Strabo, made by order of Napoleon,\r\nwith very full notes by Gosselin and others, is still the most useful\r\ntranslation: _Géographie du Strabon trad. du grec en française_ (Paris,\r\n1805-1819). 5 vols. 4to.\r\n\r\n[335] The Geography was first printed, in a Latin translation, at\r\nVincentia, in 1475; the date 1462 in the Bononia edition being\r\nrecognized as a misprint, probably for 1482. The history of the book\r\nhas been described by Lelewel in the appendix to his _Histoire de la\r\nGéographie_, and more fully in Winsor’s _Bibliography of Ptolemy’s\r\nGeography_ (Cambridge, Mass., 1884), and in the section on Ptolemy by\r\nWilberforce Eames in Sabin’s _Dictionary_, also printed separately.\r\n\r\n[336] The _Phaenomena_ of Aratus was a poem which had great vogue both\r\nin Greece and Rome. It was commented upon by Hipparchus and Achilles\r\nTatius (both of which commentaries are preserved, and are found in the\r\n_Uranologion_ of Petavius), and translated by Cicero.\r\n\r\n[337] _Gemini elementa astronomiae_, also quoted by the first word of\r\nthe Greek title, _Isagoge_. First edition, Altorph, 1590. The best\r\nedition is still that in the _Uranologion_ of Dionysius Petavius\r\n(Paris, 1630). It is also found in the rare translation of Ptolemy by\r\nHalma (Paris, 1828).\r\n\r\n[338] _Κύκλικη θεώρια_ quoted as _Cleom. de sublimibus circulis_. The\r\nfirst edition was at Paris, 1539. 4to. It has been edited by Bake\r\n(Lugd. Bat., 1826), and Schmidt (Leips. 1832). Nothing is known of the\r\nlife of Cleomedes. He wrote after the 1st cent. A.D., probably.\r\n\r\n[339] It was first printed in the Plato of Basle, 1534. There is an\r\nEnglish translation by Thomas Taylor, _The Commentaries of Proclus on\r\nthe Timaeus of Plato_, in 2 vols. (London, 1820). Proclus was also the\r\nauthor of astronomical works which helped to keep Grecian learning\r\nalive in the early Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[340] The works of L. Annaeus Seneca were first printed in Naples,\r\n1475, fol., but the _Questionum naturalium lib. vii._ were not included\r\nuntil the Venice ed. of 1490, which also contained the first edition of\r\nthe _Suasoriae and Controversariae_ of M. Ann. Seneca. The _Tragoediae_\r\nof L. Ann. Seneca were first printed about 1484 by A. Gallicus,\r\nprobably at Ferrara.\r\n\r\n[341] _Historiae naturalis libri xxxvii._ The first edition was the\r\nfamous and rare folio of Joannes de Spira, Venice, 1469. I find record\r\nof ten other editions and three issues of Landino’s Italian translation\r\nbefore 1492.\r\n\r\n[342] _C. Julii Solini Collectanea rerum memorabilium sive polyhistor._\r\nSolinus lived probably in the third century A.D. His book was a great\r\nfavorite in the Middle Ages, both in manuscript and in print, and was\r\nknown by various titles, as _Polyhistor, De situ orbis_, etc. The first\r\nedition appeared without place or date, at Rome, about 1473, and in the\r\nsame year at Venice, and it was often reprinted with the annotations\r\nof the most famous geographers. The best edition is that by Mommsen\r\n(Berlin, 1864). See Vol. II. p. 180.\r\n\r\n[343] First edition, Milan, 1471. 4to. The best is that by Parthey,\r\nBerlin, 1867. A history and bibliography of this work is given in Vol.\r\nII. p. 180.\r\n\r\n[344] _Commentariorum in somnium Scipionis libri duo._ The first\r\nedition was at Venice, 1472. There has been an edition by Jahn (2 vols.\r\nQuedlinburg, 1848, 1852), and by Eyssenhardt (Leipzig, 1868), and a\r\nFrench translation by various hands, printed in 3 vols. at Paris,\r\n1845-47.\r\n\r\n[345] _Descriptio orbis terrae; ora maritima._ The first edition\r\nappeared at Venice in 1488, with the _Phaenomena_ of Aratus. It is\r\nincluded in the _Geogr. Graec. min._ of Mueller.

Cette conséquence, qui n’avait par\r\néschappé à Eratosthène, n’est pas énoncée par Ptolémée tandis qu’elle\r\nretrouve de la manière la plus expresse chez Aristote.”\r\n\r\n[358] See also _ante_, p. 37.\r\n\r\n[359] Plato, _Phaedo_, 108; Plutarch, _De facie_.\r\n\r\n[360] Aristotle, _De caelo_, ii. 13.\r\n\r\n[361] Ctesias, _On India_, ch. v.

Civ._), Gaffarel (_Rapport_), De Costa, etc., of course helps\r\nthe investigator to clues.\r\n\r\nThe subject is mixed up with some absurdity and deceit. The Dighton\r\nRock has passed for Phœnician (Stiles’ _Sermon_, 1783; Yates and\r\nMoulton’s _New York_). At one time a Phœnician inscription in Brazil\r\nwas invented (_Am. Geog. Soc. Bull._ 1886, p. 364; St. John V. Day’s\r\n_Prehistoric Use of Iron_, Lond. 1877, p. 62). The notorious Cardiff\r\ngiant, conveniently found in New York state, was presented to a\r\ncredulous public as Phœnician (_Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, Ap. 1875). The\r\nhistory of this hoax is given by W. A. McKinney in the _New Englander_,\r\n1875, P. 759.\r\n\r\n[384] Cf. Johr.

Y.,\r\n1882).\r\n\r\n[432] His work is much more than a defence of Plato. He attempts to\r\nshow that Atlantis was the terrestrial paradise, the cradle of the\r\nworld’s civilization. I suppose it was his book which inspired Mrs. J.\r\nGregory Smith to write _Atla: a Story of the Lost Island_ (New York,\r\n1886).\r\n\r\nDonnelly’s book was favorably reviewed by Prof. Winchell (“Ancient Myth\r\nand Modern Fact,” _Dial_, Chicago, April, 1882, ii. 284), who declared\r\nthat there was no longer serious doubt that the story was founded on\r\nfact. His theory was enthusiastically adopted by Mrs. A. A. Knight in\r\n_Education_ (v. 317), and somewhat more soberly by Rev. J. P. McLean in\r\nthe _Universalist Quarterly_ (Oct., 1882, xxxix. 436, “The Continent of\r\nAtlantis”). I have not seen an article in _Kansas Review_ by Mrs. H. M.\r\nHolden, quoted in _Poole’s Index_ (_Kan. Rev._, viii. 435; also, viii.\r\n236, 640). It was more carefully examined and its claims rejected by\r\na writer in the _Journal of Science_ (London), (“Atlantis once more,”\r\nJune, 1883; xx. 319-327). W. F. Poole doubts whether Mr. Donnelly\r\nhimself was quite serious in his theorizing (“Discoveries of America:\r\nthe lost Atlantis theory,” _Dial_, Sept., 1884, v. 97). Lord Arundel\r\nof Wardour controverted Donnelly in _The Secret of Plato’s Atlantis_\r\n(London, 1885), and believes that the Atlantis fable originated in\r\nvague reports of Hanno’s voyage—a theory hardly less remarkable than\r\nthe one it aims to displace.

Also a\r\nnotice in the _Nation_, July 31, 1884.\r\n\r\nThe scientific theory of Atlantis is, I believe, supported by M. Jean\r\nd’Estienne in the _Revue des Questiones Scientifiques_, Oct., 1885, and\r\nby M. de Marçay, _Histoire des descouvertes et conquêtes de l’Amerique_\r\n(Limoges, 1881), but I have seen neither. H. H. Howorth, _The Mammoth\r\nand the Flood_ (London, 1887), is struggling to revive the credit of\r\nwater as the chief agent in the transformations of the earth’s surface,\r\nand relies much upon the deluge myths, but refuses to accept Atlantis.\r\nHe thinks the zoölogic evidence proves the existence in pleistocene\r\ntimes of an easy and natural bridge between Europe and America, but\r\nsees no need of placing it across the mid-Atlantic (p. 262).\r\n\r\n[438] _The naturall and morall historie of the East and West Indies_,\r\netc., _written in Spanish by Joseph Acosta, and translated into English\r\nby E.

A similar story is\r\nconnected with Brazil.\r\n\r\n[473] M. Buache in his _Mémoire sur l’Isle Antillia_ (_Mém. Inst. de\r\nFrance, Sciences math. et phys._, vi., 1806), read on a copy of the\r\nPizigani map of 1367, sent to him from Parma, the inscription, _Ad\r\nripas Antilliae or Antullio_. Cf. Buache’s article in German in _Allg.\r\nGeogr. Ephemeriden_, xxiv. 129. Humboldt (_Examen_, ii. 177) quotes\r\nZurla (_Viaggi_, ii. 324) as denying that such an inscription can be\r\nmade out on the original: but Fischer (_Sammlung von Welt-karten_,\r\np. 19) thinks this form of the name can be made out on Jomard’s\r\nfac-simile. Wuttke, however, thinks that the word Antillia is not to\r\nbe made out, and gives the inscription as _Hoc sont statua q fuit\r\nut tenprs A cules_, and reads _Hoc sunt statuae quae fuerunt antea\r\ntemporibus Arcules = Herculis_ (Wuttke, _Zur Geschichte der Erdkunde\r\nin der letzten Haelfte des Mittelalters_, p. 26, in _Jahresbericht des\r\nVereins für Erdkunde zu Dresden_, vi. and vii., 1870). The matter is\r\nof interest in the story of the equestrian statue of Corvo. According\r\nto the researches of Humboldt, this story first appears in print in\r\nthe history of Portugal by Faria y Sousa (_Epitome de las historias\r\nPortuguezas_, Madrid, 1628. _Historia del Reyno de Portugal_, 1730),\r\nwho describes on the “Mountain of the Crow,” in the Azores, a statue\r\nof a man on horseback pointing westward. A later version of the\r\nstory mentions a western promontory in _Corvo_ which had the form of\r\na person pointing westward. Humboldt (ii. 231), in an interesting\r\nsketch, connects this story with the Greek traditions of the columns of\r\nHercules at Gades, and with the old opinion that beyond no one could\r\npass; and with the curious Arabic stories of numberless columns with\r\ninscriptions prohibiting further navigation, set up by _Dhoulcarnain_,\r\nan Arabian hero, in whose personality Hercules and Alexander the Great\r\nare curiously compounded (see _Edrisi_). Humboldt quotes from Buache\r\na statement that on the Pizigani map of 1367 there is near Brazil\r\n(Azores) a representation of a person holding an inscription and\r\npointing westward.\r\n\r\n[474] Fernan Colomb, _Historia_, ch. 9; Horn, _De Originibus Amer._\r\np. 7, quoted by Gaffarel in his _Les îles fantastiques_, p. 3, _note_\r\n1, 2. D’Avezac, _Iles d’Afrique_, ii. 27, quotes a similar passage\r\nfrom Medina (_Arte naviguar_), who found it in the Ptolemy dedicated\r\nto Pope Urban (1378-1389). According to D’Avezac (_Iles_, ii. 28),\r\na “geographical document” of 1455 gives the name as _Antillis_, and\r\nidentifies it with Plato’s _Atlantis_.\r\n\r\n[475] Formaleoni, _Essai_, 148.\r\n\r\n[476] D’Avezac marks as wrong the reading _Sarastagio_ of Humboldt.\r\n\r\n[477] D’Avezac, _Iles d’Afrique_, ii. 29; Gaffarel, _Iles\r\nfantastiques_, 12. Fischer (_Sammlung_, 20) translates _Satanaxio,\r\nSatanshand_, but thinks the island of _Deman_, which appears on the\r\nCatalan chart of 1375, is meant by the first half of the title. The\r\nCatalan map, fac-similed by Buchon and Foster in the _Notices et\r\nextraits des documents_, xiv. 2, has been more exactly reproduced in\r\nthe _Choix des documents géographiques conservées à la Bibl. Nat._\r\n(Paris, 1883).\r\n\r\n[478] Peter Martyr, in 1493, states that cosmographers had determined\r\nthat Hispaniola and the adjacent isles were _Antillae insulae_, meaning\r\ndoubtless the group surrounding Antillia on the old maps (_Decades_,\r\ni. p. 11, ed. 1583); but the name was not popularly applied to the new\r\nislands until after Wytfliet and Ortelius had so used it (Humboldt,\r\n_Examen_, ii. 195, etc.). But Schöner, in the dedicatory letter of\r\nhis globe of 1523, says that the king of Castile through Columbus has\r\ndiscovered _Antiglias Hispaniam Cubam quoque_ (Stevens, _Schöner_,\r\nLondon, 1888, fac-simile of letter). In the same way the name Seven\r\nCities was applied to the pueblos of New Mexico by their first\r\ndiscoverers, and Brazil passed from an island to the continent.\r\n\r\n[479] Humboldt identified it with _Terceira_, but Fischer questions\r\nwhether St. Michael does not agree better with the easterly position\r\nconstantly assigned to Brazil.\r\n\r\n[480] The Bianco map of 1436 has, on the ocean sheets, five groups\r\nof small islands, from south to north: (1) Canaries; (2) Madeira and\r\nPorto Santo; (3) _luto_ and _chapisa_; (4) _d. brasil, di colonbi,\r\nd. b. ntusta, d. sanzorzi_; (5) _coriios_ and _corbo marinos_; (6)\r\n_de ventura_; (7) _de brazil_. West of the third and fourth lies\r\n_Antillia_, and N. W. of the fifth a corner of _de laman satanaxio_,\r\nwhile west of six and seven are numerous small islands unnamed. On\r\nthe ocean sheet of the Bianco of 1448, we have (2) Madeira and Porto\r\nSanto; (3) _licongi_ and _coruo marin_; (4) _de braxil, zorzi_, etc.;\r\n(5) _coriios_ and _coruos marinos_; (6) _y. d. mam debentum_; (7) _y.\r\nd. brazil d. binar_. There is no Antillia and no Satanaxio, but west\r\nof (3) and (4) are two other groups: (1) _yd. diuechi marini, y de\r\nfalconi_; (2) _y fortunat de s^o. beati. blandan, dinferno, de ipauion,\r\nbeta ixola, dexerta_. There is not much to be hoped from such geography.\r\n\r\n[481] Over against Africa he has an _Isola dei Dragoni_. On the\r\nPizigani map of 1367 the Brazil which lies W. of North France is\r\naccompanied by a cut of two ships, a dragon eating a man, and a legend\r\nstating that one cannot sail further on account of monsters. There was\r\na dragon in the Hesperian isles, and some have connected it with the\r\nfamous dragon-tree of the Canaries.\r\n\r\n[482] _Examen_, ii. 216, etc.\r\n\r\n[483] For an account of the Irish MSS. see Eugene O’Curry, _Lectures\r\non the MS. material of ancient Irish history_ (Dublin, 1861), lect.\r\nix. p. 181; H. d’Arbois de Jubainville, _Introduction a l’étude de la\r\nlittérature Celtique_, 2 vols.

A set of the Santarem series\r\nis very difficult to secure complete, but since the description of\r\nthese collections in Vol. II. was written, a set has been secured for\r\nHarvard College library, and I am not aware of another set being in\r\nthis country. The same library has the Ongania series. The maps in this\r\nlast, some of which are useful in the present study, are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. Arabic marine map, xiiith cent. (Milan); 2.

A bull of A.D.\r\n835, in Pontanus’s _Rerum Daniarum Historia_, is also held to indicate\r\nthat there were earlier peoples in Greenland than those from Iceland.\r\nSabin (vi. no. 22,854) gives as published at Godthaab, 1859-61, in 3\r\nvols., the Eskimo text of Greenland Folk Lore, collected and edited by\r\nnatives of Greenland, with a Danish translation, and showing, as the\r\nnotice says, the traditions of the first descent of the Northmen in the\r\n_eighth_ century.\r\n\r\n[519] Known as the Katortuk church.\r\n\r\n[520] An apocryphal story goes that one of these churches was built\r\nnear a boiling spring, the water from which was conducted through the\r\nbuilding in pipes for heating it! The Zeno narrative is the authority\r\nfor this. Cf. Gay’s _Pop. Hist. U. S._ i. 79.\r\n\r\n[521] The Westribygd, or western colony, had in the fourteenth century\r\n90 settlements and 4 churches; the Eystribygd had 190 settlements, a\r\ncathedral and eleven churches, with two large towns and three or four\r\nmonasteries.\r\n\r\n[522] R. G. Haliburton, in the _Popular Science Monthly_, May, 1885, p.\r\n40, gives a map in which Bjarni’s course is marked as entering the St.\r\nLawrence Gulf by the south, and emerging by the Straits of Belle Isle.\r\n\r\n[523] Dated 1135, and discovered in 1824.\r\n\r\n[524] Distinctly shown in the diverse identifications of these\r\nlandmarks which have been made.\r\n\r\n[525] On the probabilities of the Vinland voyages, see Worsaae’s _Danes\r\nand Norwegians in England_, etc., p. 109.\r\n\r\n[526] _Grönland’s Hist. Mindesmaeker_, iii. 9.\r\n\r\n[527] The popular confidence in this view is doubtless helped by\r\nMontgomery, who has made it a point in his poem on Greenland, canto v.\r\nDe Courcy (_Hist. of the Church in America_, p. 12) is cited by Howley\r\n(_Newfoundland_) as asserting that the eastern colony was destroyed by\r\n“a physical cataclysm, which accumulated the ice.” On the question of a\r\nchange of climate in Greenland, see J. D. Whitney’s _Climatic Changes_\r\n(_Mus. Comp. Zoöl. Mem._, 1882, vii. 238).\r\n\r\n[528] Rink (_Danish Greenland_, 22) is not inclined to believe that\r\nthere has been any material climatic change in Greenland since the\r\nNorse days, and favors the supposition that some portion of the finally\r\nremaining Norse became amalgamated with the Eskimo and disappeared. If\r\nthe reader wants circumstantial details of the misfortunes of their\r\n“last man,” he can see how they can be made out of what are held to be\r\nEskimo traditions in a chapter of Dr. Hayes’s _Land of Desolation_.\r\n\r\nNordenskjöld (_Voyage of the Vega_) holds, such is the rapid\r\nassimilation of a foreign stock by a native stock, that it is not\r\nunlikely that what descendants may exist of the lost colonists of\r\nGreenland may be now indistinguishable from the Eskimo.\r\n\r\nTylor (_Early Hist. Mankind_, p. 208), speaking of the Eskimo, says:\r\n“It is indeed very strange that there should be no traces found among\r\nthem of knowledge of metal-work and of other arts, which one would\r\nexpect a race so receptive of foreign knowledge would have got from\r\ncontact with the Northmen.”\r\n\r\nProf. Edward S. Morse, in his very curious study of _Ancient and Modern\r\nMethods of Arrow Release_ (Salem, 1885,—_Bull. Essex Inst._, xvii.) p.\r\n52, notes that the Eskimo are the only North American tribe practising\r\nwhat he calls the “Mediterranean release,” common to all civilized\r\nEurope, and he ventures to accept a surmise that it may have been\r\nderived from the Scandinavians.\r\n\r\n[529] Given by Schlegel, Egede (citing Pontanus), and Rafn; and a\r\nFrench version is in the _Bull. de la Soc. de Géog._, 2d series,\r\niii. 348. It is said to be preserved in a copy in the Vatican. M. F.\r\nHowley, _Ecclesiastical Hist. of Newfoundland_ (Boston, 1888), p. 43,\r\nhowever, says “Abbé Garnier mentions a bull of Pope Nicholas V, of date\r\nabout 1447, concerning the church of Greenland; but on searching the\r\nBullarium in the Propaganda library, Rome, in 1885, I could not find\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n[530] Laing’s _Heimskringla_, i. 146.\r\n\r\n[531] E. B. Tylor on “Old Scandinavian Civilization among the modern\r\nEsquimaux,” in the _Journal of the Anthropological Inst._ (1884),\r\nxiii. 348, shows that the Greenlanders still preserve some of the\r\nNorse customs, arising in part, as he thinks, from some of the lost\r\nScandinavian survivors being merged in the savage tribes. Their\r\nrecollection of the Northmen seems evident from the traditions\r\ncollected among them by Dr. Rink in his _Eskimoiske Eventyr og Sagn_\r\n(Copenhagen, 1866); and their dress, and some of their utensils and\r\ngames, as it existed in the days of Egede and Crantz, seem to indicate\r\nthe survival of customs.\r\n\r\n[532] _Cosmos_, Bohn’s ed., ii. 610; _Examen Crit._, ii. 148.\r\n\r\n[533] Cf. _Geographie de Edrisi, traduite de l’arabe en français\r\nd’après deux manuscrits de la bibliothèque du Roi, et accompagnée de\r\nnotes, par G.

The world-map by Edrisi does not indicate any\r\nknowledge of this unknown world.

Acad. des Inscriptions_, 1761, xxviii. 524) limits the\r\nArab voyage to the Canaries, and in _Notices et Extraits des MSS. de\r\nla bibliothèque du Roi_, ii. 24, he describes a MS. which makes him\r\nbelieve the Arabs reached America; and he is followed by Munoz (_Hist.\r\ndel Nuevo Mondo_, Madrid, 1793). Hugh Murray (_Discoveries and Travels\r\nin No. Amer._, Lond., 1829, i. p. II) and W. D. Cooley (_Maritime\r\nDiscovery_, 1830, i. 172) limit the explorations respectively to the\r\nAzores and the Canaries. Humboldt (_Examen Crit._, 1837, ii. 137)\r\nthinks they may possibly have reached the Canaries; but Malte Brun\r\n(_Géog. Universelle_, 1841, i. 186) is more positive. Major (_Select\r\nLetters of Columbus_, 1847) discredits the American theory, and in\r\nhis _Prince Henry_ agrees with D’Avezac that they reached Madeira.\r\nLelewel (_Géog. du Moyen Age_, ii. 78) seems likewise incredulous. S.\r\nF. Haven (_Archæol. U. S._) gives the theory and enumerates some of\r\nits supporters. Peschel (_Geschichte des Zeitalters der Entdeckungen_,\r\n1858) is very sceptical. Gaffarel (_Etudes_, etc., p. 209) fails to\r\nfind proof of the American theory. Gay (_Pop. History U. S._, i. 64)\r\nlimits their voyage to the Azores.\r\n\r\n[534] Given as A.D. 1380; but Major says, 1390. _Journal Royal Geog.\r\nSoc._, 1873, p. 180.\r\n\r\n[535] De Costa, _Verrazano the Explorer_ (N. Y., 1880), pp. 47, 63,\r\ncontends that Benedetto Bordone, writing his _Isole del Monde_ in 1521,\r\nand printing it in 1528, had access to the Zeno map thirty years and\r\nmore earlier than its publication. This, he thinks, is evident from the\r\nway in which he made and filled in his outline, and from his drawing\r\nof “Islanda,” even to a like way of engraving the name, which is in\r\na style of letter used by Bordone nowhere else. Humboldt (_Cosmos_,\r\nBohn’s ed., ii. 611) has also remarked it as singular that the name\r\nFrislanda, which, as he supposed, was not known on the maps before\r\nthe Zeni publication in 1538, should have been applied by Columbus to\r\nan island southerly from Iceland, in his _Tratado de las cinco zonas\r\nhabitables_. Cf. De Costa’s _Columbus and the Geographers of the North_\r\n(1872), p. 19. Of course, Columbus might have used the name simply\r\ndescriptively,—cold land; but it is now known that in a sea chart of\r\nperhaps the fifteenth century, preserved in the Ambrosian library at\r\nMilan, the name “Fixlanda” is applied to an island in the position of\r\nFrislanda in the Zeno chart, while in a Catalan chart of the end of\r\nthe fifteenth century the same island is apparently called “Frixlanda”\r\n(_Studi biog. e bibliog. della soc. geog. ital._, ii. nos. 400, 404).\r\n“Frixanda” is also on a chart, A.D. 1471-83, given in fac-simile to\r\naccompany Wuttke’s “Geschichte der Erdkunde” in the _Jahrbuch des\r\nVereins für Erdkunde_ (Dresden, 1870, tab. vi.).\r\n\r\n[536] Irving’s _Columbus_ takes this view.\r\n\r\n[537] J. P. Leslie’s _Man’s Origin and Destiny_, p. 114, for instance.\r\n\r\n[538] Brevoort (_Hist. Mag._, xiii. 45) thinks that the “Isola Verde”\r\nand “Isle de Mai” of the fifteenth-century maps, lying in lat. 46°\r\nnorth, was Newfoundland with its adjacent bank, which he finds in one\r\ncase represented. Samuel Robertson (_Lit. & Hist. Soc. Quebec, Trans._\r\nJan. 16) goes so far as to say that certain relics found in Canada may\r\nbe Basque, and that it was a Basque whaler, named Labrador, who gave\r\nthe name to the coast, which the early Portuguese found attached to\r\nit! We find occasional stories indicating knowledge of distant fishing\r\ncoasts at a very early date, like the following:—\r\n\r\n“In the yeere 1153 it is written that there came to Lubec, a citie of\r\nGermanie, one canoa with certaine indians, like unto a long barge,\r\nwhich seemed to have come from the coast of Baccalaos, which standeth\r\nin the same latitude that Germanie doth” (_Galvano_, Bethune’s edition,\r\np. 56).\r\n\r\n[539] W. D. Whitney, _Life and Growth of Language_, p. 258, says: “No\r\nother dialect of the old world so much resembles in structure the\r\nAmerican languages.” Cf. Farrar’s _Families of Speech_, p. 132; Nott\r\nand Gliddon’s _Indigenous Races_, 48; H. de Charencey’s _Des affinités\r\nde la langue Basque avec les idiomes du Nouveau Monde_ (Paris and\r\nCaen, 1867); and Julien Vinson’s “La langue basque et les langues\r\nAméricaines” in the _Compte Rendu, Congrès des Américanistes_ (Nancy,\r\n1875), ii. 46. On the other hand, Joly (_Man before Metals_, 316) says:\r\n“Whatever may be said to the contrary, Basque offers no analogy with\r\nthe American dialects.”\r\n\r\nThese linguistic peculiarities enter into all the studies of this\r\nremarkable stock. Cf. J. F. Blade’s _Etude sur l’origine des Basques_\r\n(Paris, 1869); W. B. Dawkins in the _Fortnightly Review_, Sept., 1874,\r\nand his _Cave Hunting_, ch. 6, with Brabrook’s critique in the _Journal\r\nAnthropological Institute_, v. 5; and Julien Vinson on “L’Ethnographie\r\ndes Basques” in _Mém. de la Soc. d’Ethnographie, Session de 1872_, p.\r\n49, with a map.\r\n\r\n[540] But see Vol. III. 45; IV. 3. Forster (_Northern Voyages_, book\r\niii. ch. 3 and 4) contends for these pre-Columbian visits of the\r\nEuropean fishermen. Cf. Winsor’s _Bibliog. of Ptolemy_, sub anno 1508.\r\nThe same currents and easterly trade-winds which helped Columbus might\r\neasily have carried chance vessels to the American coasts, as we have\r\nevidence, apparently, in the stern-post of a European vessel which\r\nColumbus saw at Guadaloupe. Haven cites Gumilla (_Hist. Orinoco_, ii.\r\n208) as stating that in 1731 a bateau from Teneriffe was thrown upon\r\nthe South American coast. Cf. J. P. Casselius, _De Navigationibus\r\nfortuitis in Americam, ante Columbum factis_ (Magdeburg, 1742);\r\nBrasseur’s _Popul Vuh_, introd.; Hunt’s _Merchants’ Mag._ xxv. 275.\r\n\r\n[541] Francisque-Michel, _Le Pays Basque_, 189, who says that the\r\nBasques were acquainted with the coasts of Newfoundland a century\r\nbefore Columbus (ch. 9).\r\n\r\nHumboldt (_Cosmos_, Eng. ed. ii. 142) is not prepared to deny such\r\nearly visits of the Basques to the northern fishing grounds. Cf.\r\nGaffarel’s _Rapport_, p. 212. Harrisse (_Notes on Columbus_, 80) goes\r\nback very far: “The Basques and Northmen, we feel confident, visited\r\nthese shores as early as the seventh century.”\r\n\r\nThere are some recent studies on these early fishing experiences in\r\nFerd. Duro’s _Disquisiciones nauticas_ (1881), and in E. Gelcich’s\r\n“Der Fischgang des Gascogner and die Entdeckung von Neufundland,” in\r\nthe _Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde zu Berlin_ (1883), vol.\r\nxviii. pp. 249-287.\r\n\r\n[542] Cf. M.

Cf. André Favyn, _Hist.\r\nde Navarre_, p. 564; and G. de Henao’s _Averignaciones de las\r\nAntigüedades? de Cantabria_, p. 25.\r\n\r\nGalvano (Hakluyt Soc. ed., p. 72) recounts the story of a Portuguese\r\nship in 1447 being driven westward from the Straits of Gibraltar to\r\nan island with seven cities, where they found the people speaking\r\nPortuguese; who said they had deserted their country on the death of\r\nKing Roderigo. “All these reasons seem to agree,” adds Galvano, “that\r\nthis should be that country which is called Nova Spagna.”\r\n\r\nIt was the year (1491) before Columbus’ voyage that the English began\r\nto send out from Bristol expeditions to discover these islands of the\r\nseven cities, and others having the same legendary existence.

This was the\r\nopinion of Prescott (_Mexico_, Kirk’s ed., iii. 398), and he based his\r\njudgment on the investigations of Waldeck, Voyage dans la Yucatan, and\r\nDupaix, _Antiquités Méxicaines_. Stephens (_Central America_) holds\r\nsimilar views. Cf. Wilson, _Prehistoric Man_, i. 327; ii. 43. Dall\r\n(_Third Rep. Bur. Ethnol._, 146) says: “There can be no doubt that\r\nAmerica was populated in some way by people of an extremely low grade\r\nof culture at a period even geologically remote. There is no reason for\r\nsupposing, however, that immigration ceased with these original people.”\r\n\r\n[547] Cf. references in H. H.

Tylor (_Early Hist.\r\nMankind_, 209) says that the Asiatics must have taught the Mexicans to\r\nmake bronze and smelt iron; and (p. 339) he finds additional testimony\r\nin the correspondence of myths, but Max Müller (_Chips_, ii. 168)\r\ndemurs. Nadaillac, in his _L’Amérique préhistorique_, discussed this\r\nwith the other supposable connections of the American people, and\r\ngenerally disbelieved in them; but Dall, in the English translation,\r\nsummarily dismisses all consideration of them as unworthy a scientific\r\nmind; but points out what the early Indian traditions are (p. 526).\r\n\r\nA good deal of stress has been laid at times on certain linguistic\r\naffiliations. Barton, in his _New Views_, sought to strengthen the\r\ncase by various comparative vocabularies. Charles Farcy went over\r\nthe proofs in his _Antiquités de l’Amérique: Discuter la valeur des\r\ndocuments relatifs à l’histoire de l’Amérique avant la conquête des\r\nEuropéens, et déterminer s’il existe des rapports entre les langues\r\nde l’Amérique et celles des tribus de l’Afrique et de l’Asie_ (Paris,\r\n1836). H. H. Bancroft (_Native Races_, v. 39) enumerates the sources of\r\nthe controversy. Roehrig (_Smithsonian Report_, 1872) finds affinities\r\nin the languages of the Dakota or Sioux Indians.

South\r\nof them is an island where a tribe of Eskimos live, and they keep\r\nconstant communication with the main of Asia, 50 miles distant, and\r\nwith America, 120 miles away. Robertson solved the difficulty by\r\nthis route. Cf. _Contributions to Amer.

Horace Davis published in the _Amer. Antiq.\r\nSoc.

It is translated in Vining, ch. 1.\r\n\r\n[555] _Examen Critique_, ii. 65, and _Ansichten der Natur_, or _Views\r\nof Nature_, p. 132.\r\n\r\n[556] Much depends on the distance intended by a Chinese _li_. Klaproth\r\ntranslated the version as given by an early Chinese historian of the\r\nseventh century, Li Yan Tcheou, and Klaproth’s version is Englished in\r\nBancroft’s _Nat. Races_, v. 33-36. Klaproth’s memoir is also translated\r\nin Vining, ch. 3. Some have more specifically pointed to Saghalien,\r\nan island at the north end of the Japan Sea. Brooks says there is a\r\ndistrict of Corea called Fusang (_Science_, viii. 402). Brasseur says\r\nthe great Chinese encyclopædia describes Fusang as lying east of Japan,\r\nand he thinks the descriptions correspond to the Cibola of Castañeda.\r\n\r\n[557] Again with a commentary in _The Continental Mag._ (New York, vol.\r\ni.). Subjected to the revision of Neumann, it is reproduced in Leland’s\r\n_Fusang_ (Lond., 1875). Cf. Vining, ch. 6, who gives also (ch. 10) the\r\naccount in Shan-Hai-king as translated by C. M. Williams in _Mag. Amer.\r\nHist._, April, 1883.\r\n\r\n[558] The pamphlets are translated in Vining, ch. 4 and 5. Paravey\r\nheld to the Mexican theory, and he at least convinced Domenech (_Seven\r\nyears’ residence in the great deserts of No. Amer._, Lond., 1860).\r\nParavey published several pamphlets on subjects allied to this. His\r\n_Mémoire sur l’origine japonaise, arabe et basque de la civilisation\r\ndes peuples du plateau de Bogota d’après les travaux de Humboldt et\r\nSiebold_ (Paris, 1835) is a treatise on the origin of the Muyscas or\r\nChibchas. Jomard, in his _Les Antiquités Américaines au point de vue\r\ndes progrès de la géographie_ (Paris, 1817) in the _Bull. de la Soc.\r\nGéog._, had questioned the Asiatic affiliations, and Paravey replied\r\nin a _Réfutation de l’opinion émise par Jomard que les peuples de\r\nl’Amérique n’ont jamais en aucun rapport avec ceux de l’Asie_ (Paris,\r\n1849), originally in the _Annales de philosophie Chrétienne_ (May,\r\n1849).\r\n\r\n[559] Also in the _Rev. Archéologique_ (vols. x., xi.), and epitomized\r\nin Leland. Cf. also Dr. A. Godron on the Buddhist mission to America\r\nin _Annales des Voyages_ (Paris, 1864), vol. iv., and an opposing view\r\nby Vivien de St. Martin in _L’Année géographique_ (1865), iii. p. 253,\r\nwho was in turn controverted by Brasseur in his _Monuments Anciens du\r\nMéxique_.\r\n\r\n[560] This paper is reprinted in Leland.\r\n\r\n[561] Cf. also his _Variétés Orientales_, 1872; and his “L’Amérique,\r\netait-elle connue des Chinois à l’époque du déluge?” in the _Archives\r\nde la Soc. Amér. de France_, n. s., iii. 191.\r\n\r\n[562] S. W. Williams, in the _Journal of the American Oriental Soc._\r\n(vol. xi.), in controverting the views of Leland, was inclined to find\r\nFusang in the Loo-choo Islands. This paper was printed separately as\r\n_Notices of Fusang and other countries lying east of China in the\r\nPacific ocean_ (New Haven, 1881).\r\n\r\n[563] A good deal of labor has been bestowed to prove this identity of\r\nFusang with Mexico. It is held to be found in the myths and legends\r\nof the two people by Charency in his _Mythe de Votan, étude sur les\r\norigines asiatiques de la civilisation américaine_ (Alençon, 1871),\r\ndrawn from the _Actes de la Soc. philologique_ (vol. ii.); and he has\r\nenforced similar views in the _Revue des questions historiques_ (vi.\r\n283), and in his _Djemschid et Quetzalcohuatl. L’histoire légendaire de\r\nla Nouvelle-Espagne rapprochée de la source indo-européenne_ (Alençon,\r\n1874). Humboldt thought it strange, considering other affinities,—as\r\nfor instance in the Mexican calendars,—that he could find no Mexican\r\nuse of phallic symbols; but Bancroft says they exist. Cf. _Native\r\nRaces_, iii. 501; also see v. 40, 232; Brasseur’s _Quatre Lettres_, p.\r\n202; and John Campbell’s paper on the traditions of Mexico and Peru as\r\nestablishing such connections, in the _Compte Rendu, Congrès des Amér._\r\n(Nancy, 1875), i. 348. Dr. Hamy saw in a monument found at Copan an\r\ninscription which he thought was the Taë-kai of the Chinese, the symbol\r\nof the essence of all things (_Bull. de la Soc. de Géog._, 1886, and\r\n_Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, xvi. 242, with a cut of the\r\nstone). Dall controverts this point (_Science_, viii. 402).\r\n\r\nOthers have dwelt on the linguistic resemblances. B. S. Barton in\r\nhis _New Views_ pressed this side of the question. The presence of a\r\nmonosyllabic tongue like the Otomi in the midst of the polysyllabic\r\nlanguages of Mexico has been thought strongly to indicate a survival.\r\nCf. Manuel Najera’s _Disertacion sobre la lengua Othomi_, Mexico,\r\n1845, and in _Amer. Philos. Soc. Trans._, n. s., v.; Ampère’s\r\n_Promenade en Amérique_, ii. 301; Prescott’s _Mexico_, iii. 396;\r\nWarden’s _Recherches_ (in Dupaix), p. 125; Latham’s _Races of Men_,\r\n408; Bancroft’s _Nat. Races_, iii. 737; v. 39, with references. Others\r\nfind Sanskrit roots in the Mexican. E. B. Tylor has indicated the\r\nAsiatic origin of certain Mexican games (_Journal of the Anthropol.\r\nInst._, xxiv.). Ornaments of jade found in Nicaragua, while the stone\r\nis thought to be native only in Asia, is another indication, and they\r\nare more distinctively Asiatic than the jade ornaments found in Alaska\r\n(_Peabody Mus. Reports_, xviii. 414; xx. 548; _Proc. Mass. Hist. Soc._,\r\nJan., 1886).\r\n\r\nOn the general question of the Asiatic origin of the Mexicans see\r\nDupaix’s _Antiquités Méxicaines_, with included papers by Lenoir,\r\nWarden, and Farcy; the _Report_ on a railroad route from the\r\nMississippi, 1853-54 (Washington); Whipple’s and other _Reports_ on the\r\nIndian tribes; John Russell Bartlett’s _Personal Narrative_ (1854);\r\nBrasseur’s _Popul Vuh_, p. xxxix; Viollet le Duc’s belief in a “yellow\r\nrace” building the Mexican and Central American monuments, in Charnay’s\r\n_Ruines Américaines_, and Charnay’s traces of the Buddhists in the\r\n_Popular Science Monthly_, July, 1879, p. 432; Le Plongeon’s belief\r\nin the connection of the Maya and Asiatic races in _Amer. Antiq. Soc.\r\nProc._, Apr. 30, 1879, p. 113; and some papers on the ancient Mexicans\r\nand their origin by the Abbé Jolibois, Col. Parmentier, and M. Emile\r\nGuimet, which, prepared for the Soc. de Géog. de Lyon, were published\r\nseparately as _De l’origine des Anciens Peuples du Méxique_ (Lyon,\r\n1875).\r\n\r\nA few other incidental discussions of the Fusang question are these: R.\r\nH. Major in _Select Letters of Columbus_ (1847); J. T. Short in _The\r\nGalaxy_ (1875) and in his _No. Americans of Antiquity_; Nadaillac in\r\nhis _L’Amérique préhistorique_, 544; Gay’s _Pop. Hist. U. S._ calls\r\nthe story vague and improbable. In periodicals we find: _Gentleman’s\r\nMag._, 1869, p. 333 (reprinted in _Hist. Mag._, Sept., 1869, xvi. 221),\r\nand 1870, reproduced in _Chinese Recorder_, May, 1870; Nathan Brown in\r\n_Amer. Philolog. Mag._, Aug., 1869; Wm. Speer in _Princeton Rev._, xxv.\r\n83; _Penn Monthly_, vi. 603; _Mag. Amer. Hist._, Apr., 1883, p. 291;\r\n_Notes and Queries_, iii. 58, 78; iv. 19; _Notes and Queries in China\r\nand Japan_, Apr., May, 1869; Feb., 1870. Chas. W. Brooks maintained\r\non the other hand (_Proc. California Acad. Sciences_, 1876; cf.\r\nBancroft’s _Native Races_, v. 51), that the Chinese were emigrants from\r\nAmerica. There is a map of the supposed Chinese route to America in\r\nthe _Congrès des Américanistes_ (Nancy, 1875), vol. i.; and Winchell,\r\n_Pre-Adamites_, gives a chart showing different lines of approach from\r\nAsia. Stephen Powers (_Overland Monthly_, Apr., 1872, and _California\r\nAcad. Sciences_, 1875) treats the California Indians as descendants of\r\nthe Chinese,—a view he modifies in the _Contrib. to Amer. Ethnology_,\r\nvol. iii., on “Tribes of California.” It is claimed that Chinese coin\r\nof the fifteenth century have been found in mounds on Vancouver’s\r\nIsland. Cf. G. P. Thurston in _Mag. Amer. Hist._, xiii. p. 457. The\r\nprincipal lists of authorities are those in Vining (app.), and Watson’s\r\nin Anderson’s _America not discovered by Columbus_.\r\n\r\n[564] From Easter Island to the Galapagos is 2,000 miles, thence to\r\nSouth America 600 more. On such long migrations by water see Waitz,\r\n_Introduction to Anthropology_, Eng. transl., p. 202. On early modes of\r\nnavigation see Col. A. Lane Fox in the _Journal Anthropological Inst._\r\n(1875), iv. 399. Otto Caspari gives a map of post-tertiary times in his\r\n_Urgeschichte der Menschheit_ (Leipzig, 1873), vol. i., in which land\r\nis made to stretch from the Marquesas Islands nearly to South America;\r\nwhile large patches of land lie between Asia and Mexico, to render\r\nmigration practicable. Andrew Murray, in his _Geographical Distribution\r\nof Mammals_ (London, 1866), is almost compelled to admit (p. 25) that\r\nas complete a circuit of land formerly crossed the southern temperate\r\nregions as now does the northern; and Daniel Wilson, _Prehistoric Man_,\r\nholds much the same opinion. The connection of the flora of Polynesia\r\nand South America is discussed by J. D. Hooker in the _Botany of the\r\nAntarctic Voyage of the Erebus and Terror, 1839-43_, and in his _Flora\r\nof Tasmania_. Cf. _Amer. Journal of Science and Arts_, Mar., May, 1854;\r\nJan., May, 1860.\r\n\r\n[565] _Races of Men._\r\n\r\n[566] _Compte Rendu_, 1877, p. 79; 1883, p. 246; the latter\r\nbeing called “Polynesian Antiquities, a link between the ancient\r\ncivilizations of Asia and America.” Further discussions of the\r\nPolynesian migrations will be found as follows: A. W. Bradford’s _Amer.\r\nAntiquities_ (N. Y., 1841); Gallatin (_Am. Eth. Soc. Trans._, i. 176)\r\ndisputed any common linguistic traces, while Bradford thought he found\r\nsuch; Lesson and Martinet’s _Les Polynésiens, leur origine, leurs\r\nmigrations, leur langage_; Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_, ii. 344; Jules\r\nGarnier’s “Les migrations polynésiennes” in _Bull. de la Soc. de Géog.\r\nde Paris_, Jan., June, 1870; G. d’Eichthal’s “Etudes sur l’histoire\r\nprimitive des races océaniennes et Américaines” in _Mem. de la Soc.\r\nEthnologique_ (vol. ii.); Marcoy’s _Travels in South America_; C.\r\nStaniland Wake’s _Chapters on Man_, p. 200; a “Rapport de la Polynésie\r\net l’Amérique” in the _Mémoires de la Soc.

Peschel in\r\n_Ausland_, 1864, p. 348; W. H. Dall in _Bureau of Ethnology Rept._,\r\n1881-82, p. 147. Allen’s paper, already referred to, gives references.\r\n\r\n[567] Bancroft, _Nat. Races_, v. 44, with references, p. 48, epitomizes\r\nthe story. Cf. Short, 151. There was a tradition of giants landing on\r\nthe shore (Markham’s _Cieza de Leon_, p. 190). Cf. Forster’s _Voyages_,\r\n43.\r\n\r\n[568] A belief in the Asiatic connection has taken some curious forms.\r\nMontesinos in his _Memorias Peruanas_ held Peru to be the Ophir\r\nof Solomon. Cf. Gotfriedus Wegner’s _De Navigationis Solomonæis_\r\n(Frankfort, 1689). Horn held Hayti to be Ophir, and he indulges in some\r\nfantastic evidences to show that the Iroquois, _i. e._ Yrcas, were\r\nTurks! Cf. Onffroy de Thoron in _Le Globe_, 1869. C. Wiener in his\r\n_L’Empire des Incas_ (ch. 2, 4) finds traces of Buddhism, and so does\r\nHyde Clarke in his _Khita-Peruvian Epoch_ (1877). Lopez has written\r\non _Les Races Aryennes de Pérou_ (1871). Cf. Robert Ellis, _Peruvia\r\nScythica_. _The Quicha Language of Peru, its derivation from Central\r\nAsia with the American languages in general_ (London, 1875). Grotius\r\nheld that the Peruvians were of Chinese stock. Charles Pickering’s\r\nethnological map gives a Malay origin to the islands of the Gulf of\r\nMexico and a part of the Pacific coast, the rest being Mongolian.\r\n\r\n[569] The story is given in English by De Costa (_Pre-Columbian Disc.\r\nof America_, p. 85) from the _Landnámabók_, no. 107. Cf. _Saga of\r\nThorfinn Karlsefne_, ch. 13, and that of Erik the Red. Leif is said in\r\nthe sagas to have met shipwrecked white people on the coasts visited by\r\nhim (_Hist.

Cf. Sir Walter Scott’s version of\r\nthis saga and the appendix of Mallet’s _Northern Antiquities_\r\n\r\n[574] Traces of Celtic have been discovered by some of the\r\nphilologists, when put to the task, in the American languages. Cf.\r\nHumboldt, _Relation Historique_, iii. 159. Lord Monboddo held such a\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n[575] Brinton’s _Myths of the New World_, 176. One of the earliest\r\naccounts which we have of the Cherokees is that by Henry Timberlake\r\n(London, 1765), and he remarks on their lighter complexion as\r\nindicating a possible descent from these traditionary white men.\r\n\r\n[576] Richard Broughton’s _Monasticon Britannicum_ (London, 1655), pp.\r\n131, 187.\r\n\r\n[577] _A Memoir on the European Colonization of America in antehistoric\r\ntimes_ was contributed to the _Proceedings_ of the American\r\nEthnological Society in 1851, to which E. G. Squier added some notes,\r\nthe original paper being by Dr. C. A. A. Zestermann of Leipzig. The\r\naim was to prove, by the similarity of remains, the connection of the\r\npeoples who built the mounds of the Ohio Valley with the early peoples\r\nof northwestern Europe, a Caucasian race, which he would identify\r\nwith the settlers of Irland it Mikla, and with the coming of the\r\nwhite-bearded men spoken of in Mexican traditions, who established a\r\ncivilization which an inundating population from Asia subsequently\r\nburied from sight. This European immigration he places at least\r\n1,200 years before Christ. Squier’s comments are that the monumental\r\nresemblances referred to indicate similar conditions of life rather\r\nthan ethnic connections.\r\n\r\nThe other advocate was Eugène Beauvois in a paper published in the\r\n_Compte Rendu du Congrès des Américanistes_ (Nancy, 1875, p. 4) as _La\r\ndécouverte du nouveau monde par les irlandais et les premières traces\r\ndu christianisme en Amérique avant l’an 1000_, accompanied by a map, in\r\nwhich he makes Irland it Mikla correspond to the provinces of Ontario\r\nand Quebec. Again, in the session at Luxembourg in 1877, he endeavored\r\nto connect the Irish colony with the narrative of the seaman in the\r\nZeno accounts, in a paper which he called _Les Colonies Européennes\r\ndu Markland et de l’Escociland au xiv. Siècle, et les vestiges qui\r\nen subsistèrent jusqu’aux xvi^e et xvii^e Siècles_, and in which\r\nhe identifies the Estotiland of the Frislanda mariner. M. Beauvois\r\nagain, at the Copenhagen meeting of the same body, read a paper on\r\n_Les Relations précolumbiennes des Gaels avec le Méxique_ (Copenhagen,\r\n1883, p. 74), in which he elicited objections from M. Lucien Adam.\r\nBeauvois belongs to that class of enthusiasts somewhat numerous in\r\nthese studies of pre-Columbian discoveries, who have haunted these\r\nCongresses of Americanists, and who see overmuch. Other references to\r\nthese Irish claims are to be found in Laing’s _Heimskringla_, i. 186;\r\nBeamish’s _Discovery of America_ (London, 1841); Gravier’s _Découverte\r\nde l’Amérique_, p. 123, 137, and his _Les Normands sur la route, etc._,\r\nch. 1; Gaffarel’s _Etudes sur les rapports de l’Amérique_, pp. 201,\r\n214; Brasseur’s introd. to his _Popul Vuh_; De Costa’s _Pre-Columbian\r\nDiscovery_, pp. xviii, xlix, lii; Humboldt’s _Cosmos_ (Bohn), ii. 607;\r\nRask in _Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc._, xviii. 21; _Journal London Geog.\r\nSoc._, viii. 125; Gay’s _Pop. Hist. U. S._, i. 53; and K. Wilhelmi’s\r\n_Island, Hvitramannaland, Grönland und Vinland, oder Der Norrmänner\r\nLeben auf Island und Grönland und deren Fahrten nach Amerika schon über\r\n500 Jahre vor Columbus_ (Heidelberg, 1842).\r\n\r\n[578] The account in the Landnámabók is briefly rehearsed in ch. 8 of\r\nC. W. Paijkull’s _Summer in Iceland_ (London, 1868).\r\n\r\n[579] There are various editions, of which the best is called that\r\nof Copenhagen, 1843. The _Islendingabók_, a sort of epitome of a\r\nlost historical narrative, is considered an introduction to the\r\n_Landnámabók_. Much of the early story will be found in Latin in the\r\n_Islenzkir Annáler, sive Annales Islandici ab anno Christi 803 ad anno\r\n1430_ (Copenhagen, 1847); in the _Scripta historica Islandorum de rebus\r\nveterum Borealium_, published by the Royal Soc. of Northern Antiquaries\r\nat Copenhagen, 1828-46; and in Jacobus Langebek’s _Scriptores Rerum\r\nDanicarum medii ævi_ (Copenhagen, 1772-1878,—the ninth volume being a\r\nrecently added index).\r\n\r\n[580] A convenient survey of this early literature is in chapter 1 of\r\nthe _History of the Literature of the Scandinavian North, from the most\r\nancient times to the present, by Frederick Winkel Horn, revised by the\r\nauthor, and translated by Rasmus B. Anderson_ (Chicago, 1884). The text\r\nis accompanied by useful bibliographical details. Cf. B. F. De Costa in\r\n_Journal Amer. Geog. Soc._ (1880), xii. 159.\r\n\r\n[581] Saxo Grammaticus acknowledges his dependence on the Icelandic\r\nsagas, and is thought to have used some which had not been yet put into\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n[582] Baring-Gould in his _Iceland, its Scenes and Sagas_ (London,\r\n1863) gives in his App. D a list of thirty-five published sagas,\r\nsixty-six local histories, twelve ecclesiastical annals, and sixty-nine\r\nNorse annals. Cf. the eclectic list in Laing’s _Heimskringla_, i. 17.\r\n\r\nKonrad Maurer has given an elaborate essay on this early literature\r\nin his _Ueber die Ausdrücke: altnordische, altnorwegische und\r\nisländische Sprache_ (Munich, 1867), which originally appeared in the\r\n_Abhandlungen_ of the Bavarian Academy.\r\n\r\nG. P. Marsh translated P. E. Müller’s “Origin, progress, and decline\r\nof Icelandic historical literature” in _The American Eclectic_ (N.\r\nY., 1841,—vols. i., ii.). In 1781, Lindblom printed at Paris a French\r\ntranslation of Bishop Troil’s _Lettres sur l’Islande_, which contained\r\na catalogue of books on Iceland and an enumeration of the Icelandic\r\nsagas. (Cf. Pinkerton’s _Voyages_, vol. i.) Chavanne’s _Bibliography of\r\nthe Polar Regions_, p. 95, has a section on Iceland.\r\n\r\nSolberg’s list of illustrative works, appended to Anderson’s version\r\nof Horn’s _Lit. of the Scandinavian North_, is useful so far as the\r\nEnglish language goes. Periodical contributions also appear in _Poole’s\r\nIndex_ (p. 622) and _Supplement_, p. 214.\r\n\r\nBurton (_Ultima Thule_, i. 239) enumerates the principal writers on\r\nIceland from Arngrimur Jónsson down, including the travellers of this\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[583] The more general histories of Scandinavia, like Sinding’s English\r\nnarrative,—not a good book, but accessible,—yield the comparisons more\r\nreadily.\r\n\r\n[584] There are also German (Gotha, 1844-75) and French versions\r\n(Paris). The best German version, _Geschichte Schwedens_ (Hamburg and\r\nGotha, 1832-1887), is in six volumes, a part of the _Geschichte der\r\neuropäischen Staaten_. Vol. 1-3, by E. G. Geijer, is translated by O.\r\nP. Leffler; vol. 4, by F. F. Carlson, is translated by J. G. Petersen;\r\nvol. 5, 6, by F. F. Carlson.\r\n\r\n[585] Published in German at Lübeck in 1854 as _Das heroische Zeitalter\r\nder Nordisch-Germanischen Völker und die Wikinger-Züge_.\r\n\r\n[586] Maurer had long been a student of Icelandic lore, and his\r\n_Isländische Volkssagen der Gegenwart gesammelt und verdeutscht_\r\n(Leipzig, 1860) is greatly illustrative of the early north. Conybeare\r\n(_Place of Iceland in the History of European Institutions_, preface)\r\nsays: “To any one writing on Iceland the elaborate works of the learned\r\nMaurer afford at once a help and difficulty: a help in so far as they\r\nshed the fullest light upon the subjects; a difficulty in that their\r\npainstaking completeness has brought together well-nigh everything that\r\ncan be said.”\r\n\r\n[587] What is known as the Kristni Saga gives an account of this\r\nchange. Cf. Eugène Beauvois, _Origines et fondation du plus ancien\r\névêché du nouveau monde. Le diocèse de Gardhs en Grœnland, 986-1126_\r\n(Paris, 1878), an extract from the _Mémoires de la Soc. d’Histoire,\r\netc., de Beaune_; C. A. V. Conybeare’s _Place of Iceland in the\r\nhistory of European institutions_ (1877); Maurer’s _Beiträge zur\r\nRechtsgeschichte des germanischen Nordens_; Wheaton’s _Northmen_;\r\nWorsaae’s _Danes and Norwegians in England_, p. 332; Jacob Rudolph\r\nKeyser’s _Private Life of the Old Northmen_, as translated by M.\r\nR. Barnard (London, 1868), and his _Religion of the Northmen_, as\r\ntranslated by B. Pennock (N. Y., 1854); _Quarterly Review_, January,\r\n1862; and references in McClintock and Strong’s _Cyclopædia_, under\r\nIceland.\r\n\r\n[588] Such are the Swedish work of A. M. Strinhold, known in the German\r\nof E. F. Frisch as _Wikingzüge, Staatsverfassung und Sitten der alten\r\nScandinaver_ (Hamburg, 1839-41).\r\n\r\nA summarized statement of life in Iceland in the early days is held to\r\nbe well made out in Hans O. H. Hildebrand’s _Lifvet þå Island under\r\nSagotiden_ (Stockholm, 1867), and in A. E. Holmberg’s _Nordbon under\r\nHednatiden_ (Stockholm). J. A. Worsaae published his _Vorgeschichte des\r\nNordens_ at Hamburg in 1878. It was improved in a Danish edition in\r\n1880, and from this H. F. Morland Simpson made the _Prehistory of the\r\nNorth, based on contemporary materials_ (London, 1886), with a memoir\r\nof Worsaae (d. 1885), the foremost scholar in this northern lore.\r\n\r\n[589] This book is recognized as one of the best commentaries and most\r\ninforming books on Icelandic history, and this writer’s introduction\r\nto Gudbrand Vigfússon’s _Icelandic-English Dictionary_ (3 vols.,\r\nCambridge, Eng., 1869, 1870, 1874) is of scholarly importance.\r\n\r\n[590] The millennial celebration of the settlement of Iceland in 1874\r\ngave occasion to a variety of books and papers, more or less suggestive\r\nof the early days, like Samuel Kneeland’s _American in Iceland_\r\n(Boston. 1876); but the enumeration of this essentially descriptive\r\nliterature need not be undertaken here.\r\n\r\n[591] _Antiquitates Americanæ_, pp. 1-76, with an account of the\r\nGreenland MSS. (p. 255). Müller’s _Sagenbibliothek_. Arngrimur\r\nJónsson’s _Grönlandia_ (Iceland, 1688). A fac-simile of the title is\r\nin the _Carter-Brown Catalogue_, ii., no. 1356. A translation by Rev.\r\nJ. Sephton is in the _Proc. Lit. and Philos. Soc. of Liverpool_, vol.\r\nxxxiv. 183, and separately, Liverpool, 1880. There is a paper in the\r\n_Jahresbericht der geographischen Gesellschaft in München für 1885_\r\n(Munich, 1886), p. 71, by Oskar Brenner, on “Grönland im Mittelalter\r\nnach einer altnorwegischen Quelle.”\r\n\r\nSome of the earliest references are: Christopherson Claus’ _Den\r\nGrölandske Chronica_ (Copenhagen, 1608), noticed in the _Carter-Brown\r\nCatalogue_, ii., no. 64. Gerald de Veer’s _True and perfect description\r\nof three voyages_ speaks in its title (_Carter-Brown_, ii. 38) of “the\r\ncountrie lying under 80 degrees, which is thought to be Greenland,\r\nwhere never man had been before.” Antoine de la Sale wrote between 1438\r\nand 1447 a curious book, printed in 1527 as _La Salade_, in which he\r\nrefers to Iceland and Greenland (Gronnellont), where white bears abound\r\n(Harrisse, _Bib. Am. Vet._, no. 140).\r\n\r\n[592] This book is now rare. Dufossé prices it at 50 francs; F. S.\r\nEllis,—London. 1884, at £5.5.0. Before Torfæus, probably the best\r\nknown book was Isaac de la Peyrère’s _Relation du Groenland_ (Paris,\r\n1647). It is one of the earliest books to give an account of the\r\nEskimos. It was again printed in 1674 in _Recueil de Voyages du Nord_.\r\nA Dutch edition at Amsterdam in 1678 (_Nauwkenrige Beschrijvingh van\r\nGroenland_) was considerably enlarged with other matter, and this\r\nedition was the basis of the German version published at Nuremberg,\r\n1679. Peyrère’s description will be found in English in a volume\r\npublished by the Hakluyt Society in 1855, where it is accompanied\r\nby two maps of the early part of the seventeenth century. Cf.\r\nCarter-Brown, ii., no. 1192, note; Sabin, x. p. 70.\r\n\r\n[593] Pilling (_Eskimo Bibliog._, p. 20) gives the most careful account\r\nof editions. Cf. Sabin, v. 66. A Dutch translation at Haarlem in 1767\r\nwas provided with better and larger maps than the original issue; and\r\nthis version was again brought out with a changed title in 1786. There\r\nwas a Swedish ed. at Stockholm in 1769, and a reprint of the original\r\nGerman at Leipzig in 1770, and it is included in the _Bibliothek der\r\nneuesten Reisebeschreibungen_ (Frankfort, 1779-1797), vol. xx. Cf.\r\nCarter-Brown, ii., nos. 1443, 1576, 1577, 1671, 1728.\r\n\r\n[594] This constitutes in 3 vols. a sort of supplement to the\r\n_Antiquitates Americanæ_, Cf. _Dublin Review_, xxvii. 35; _Bulletin de\r\nla Soc. de Géog. de Paris_, 3d ser., vol. vi., and a synopsis of the\r\n_Mindesmæker_ in _The Sacristy_, Feb. 1, 1871 (London).\r\n\r\n[595] The principal ruin is that of a church, and it will be found\r\nrepresented in the Antiquitates Americanæ, and again by Nordenskjöld,\r\nSteenstrup, J. T. Smith (_Discovery of America_, etc.), Horsford; and,\r\nnot to name more, in Hayes’s _Land of Desolation_ (and in the French\r\nversion in _Tour du Monde_, xxvi.).\r\n\r\n[596] Rafn in his _Americas arctiske landes Gamle Geographie efter de\r\nNordiske Oldskrifter_ (Copenhagen, 1845) gives the seals of some of the\r\nGreenland bishops, various plans of the different ruins, a view of the\r\nKatortok church with its surroundings, engraving of the different runic\r\ninscriptions, and a map of the Julianehaab district.\r\n\r\n[597] This tendency of the Scandinavian writers is recognized among\r\nthemselves. Horn (Anderson’s translation, 324) ascribes it to “an\r\nunbridled fancy and want of critical method rather than to any wilful\r\nperversion of historical truth. This tendency owed its origin to an\r\nintense patriotism, a leading trait in the Swedish character, which on\r\nthis very account was well-nigh incorrigible.”\r\n\r\n[598] Dasent translates from the preface to _Egils Saga_ (Reikjavik,\r\n1856): “The sagas show no wilful purpose to tell untruths, but simply\r\nare proofs of _the beliefs and turns of thought of men in the age when\r\nthe sagas were reduced to writing_” (_Burnt Njal_, i. p. xiii).\r\n\r\n[599] Rink (_Danish Greenland_, p. 3) says of the sagas that “they\r\nexist only in a fragmentary condition, and bear the general character\r\nof popular traditions to such a degree that they stand much in need\r\nof being corroborated by collateral proofs, if we are wholly to rely\r\nupon them in such a question as an ancient colonization of America.”\r\nSo he proceeds to enumerate the kind of evidence, which is sufficient\r\nin Greenland, but is wholly wanting in other parts of America, and to\r\npoint out that the trustworthiness of the sagas of the Vinland voyages\r\nexists only in regard to their general scope.\r\n\r\nDasent, in the introduction of Vigfússon’s _Icelandic Dictionary_,\r\nsays of the sagas: “Written at various periods by scribes more or less\r\nfitted for the task, they are evidently of very varying authority.”\r\nThe Scandinavian authorities class the sagas as mythical histories, as\r\nthose relating to Icelandic history (subdivided into general, family,\r\npersonal, ecclesiastical), and as the lives of rulers.\r\n\r\n[600] Anderson’s translation, _Lit. of the Scand. North_, p. 81.\r\n\r\n[601] Laing (_Heimskringla_, i. 23) says: “Arne Magnussen was the\r\ngreatest antiquary who never wrote; his judgments and opinions are\r\nknown from notes, selections, and correspondence, and are of great\r\nauthority at this day in the saga literature. Torfæus consulted him in\r\nhis researches.”\r\n\r\n[602] _Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc._, xviii. 20.\r\n\r\n[603] Oswald Moosmüller’s _Europäer in Amerika vor Columbus_\r\n(Regensburg, 1879, p. 4) enumerates the manuscripts in the royal\r\nlibrary in Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n[604] A. E.

Of the different manuscripts, some call Vinland a “regio” and\r\nothers an “insula.”\r\n\r\n[606] Discovered in the seventeenth century in a monastery on an\r\nisland close by the Icelandic coast, and now in the royal library\r\nin Copenhagen. Cf. Laing’s introduction to his edition of the\r\n_Heimskringla_, vol. i. p. 157. Horn says of this codex: “The book was\r\nwritten towards the end of the fourteenth century by two Icelandic\r\npriests, and contains in strange confusion and wholly without criticism\r\na large number of sagas, poems, and stories. No other manuscript\r\nconfuses things on so vast a scale.” Anderson’s translation of Horn’s\r\n_Lit. of the Scandin. North_, p. 60. Cf. _Flateyjarbok. En Samling af\r\nNorske Konge-Sagaer med indskudte mindre fortællinger om Begivenheder i\r\nog Udenfor Norge samt Annaler_ (Christiania, 1860); and Vigfússon’s and\r\nUnger’s edition of 1868, also at Christiania. The best English account\r\nof the _Codex Flatoyensis_ is by Gudbrand Vigfússon in the preface to\r\nhis _Icelandic Sagas_, published under direction of the Master of the\r\nRolls, London, 1887, vol. i. p. xxv.\r\n\r\n[607] For texts, see C. C. Rafn’s edition of _Kong Olaf Tryggvesons\r\nSaga_ (Copenhagen, 1826), and Munch’s edition of _Kong Olaf\r\nTryggvesön’s Saga_ (Christiania, 1853). Cf. also P. A. Munch’s _Norges\r\nKonge-Sagaer_ of Snorri Sturleson, Sturla Thordsson, etc. (Christiania,\r\n1859).\r\n\r\n[608] The _Codex Flatoyensis_ says that it was sixteen winters after\r\nthe settlement of Greenland before Leif went to Norway, and that in the\r\nnext year he sailed to Vinland.\r\n\r\n[609] _Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc._, xviii. 21.\r\n\r\n[610] These sagas are given in Icelandic, Danish, and Latin in Rafn’s\r\n_Antiquitates Americanæ_ (Copenhagen, 1837). Versions or abstracts,\r\nmore or less full, of all or of some of them are given by Beamish, in\r\nhis _Discovery of America by the Northmen_ (London, 1841), whose text\r\nis reprinted by Slafter, in his _Voyages of the Northmen_ (Boston,\r\n1877).

It was later found\r\nthat Peringskiöld had drawn these eight chapters from the _Codex\r\nFlatoyensis_, which particular MS. was unknown to Torfæus. When Laing\r\nprinted his edition of the _Heimskringla, The Sea Kings of Norway_\r\n(London, 1844), he translated these eight chapters in his appendix\r\n(vol. iii. 344). Laing (_Heimskringla_, i. 27) says: “Snorro Sturleson\r\nhas done for the history of the Northmen what Livy did for the history\r\nof the Romans,”—a rather questionable tribute to the verity of the saga\r\nhistory, in the light of the most approved comments on Livy. Cf. Horn,\r\nin Anderson’s translation, _Lit. of the Scandinavian North_ (Chicago,\r\n1884), p. 56, with references, p. 59.\r\n\r\n[612] J. Fulford Vicary’s _Saga Time_ (Lond., 1887). Some time in the\r\nfifteenth century, a monk, Thomas Gheysmer, made an abridgment of Saxo,\r\nalleging that he “had said much rather for the sake of adornment than\r\nin behalf of truth.” The Canon Christiern Pederson printed the first\r\nedition of Saxo at Paris in 1514 (Anderson’s Horn’s _Lit. Scandin.\r\nNorth_, p. 102). This writer adds: “The entire work rests exclusively\r\non oral tradition, which had been gathered by Saxo, and which he\r\nrepeated precisely as he had heard it, for in the whole chronicle there\r\nis no trace of criticism proper.... Saxo must also undoubtedly have\r\nhad Icelandic sagamen as authorities for the legendary part of his\r\nwork; but there is not the slightest evidence to show that he ever had\r\na written Icelandic saga before him.... In this part of the work he\r\nbetrays no effort to separate fact from fiction, ... and he has in many\r\ninstances consciously or unconsciously adorned the original material.”\r\nHorn adds that the last and best edition is that of P. E. Müller and J.\r\nVelchow, _Saxonis Grammatici Historia Danica_ (Copenhagen, 1839).\r\n\r\n[613] Humboldt (_Crit. Exam._, ii. 120) represented that Ortelius\r\nreferred to these voyages in 1570; but Palfrey (_Hist. New England_, i.\r\n51) shows that the language cited by Humboldt was not used by Ortelius\r\ntill in his edition of 1592, and that then he referred to the Zeno\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n[614] See _post_, Vol. IV. p. 492.\r\n\r\n[615] His account is followed by Malte Brun in his _Précis de la\r\nGéographie_ (i. 395).

In 1885 the\r\nBritish Museum issued a _Catalogue of the books printed in Iceland\r\nfrom A.D. 1578 to 1880 in the library of the British Museum_. In 1886\r\nMr. Fiske privately printed at Florence _Bibliographical Notices, i.:\r\nBooks printed in Iceland, 1578-1844, a supplement to the British Museum\r\nCatalogue,_ which enumerates 139 titles with full bibliographical\r\ndetail and an index. He refers also to the principal bibliographical\r\nauthorities. Laing’s introduction to the _Heimskringla_ gives a survey.\r\n\r\n[631] Cf. list of their several issues in Scudder’s _Catal. of Scient.\r\nSerials_, nos. 640, 654, and the Rafn bibliography in Sabin, xvi. nos.\r\n67,466-67,486. In addition to its Danish publications, the chief of\r\nwhich interesting to the American archæologist being the _Antiquarisk\r\nTidsskrift_ (1845-1864), sometimes known as the _Revue Archéologique\r\net Bulletin_, the society, under its more familiar name of Société\r\nRoyale des Antiquaires du Nord, has issued its _Mémoires_, the first\r\nseries running from 1836 to 1860, in 4 vols., and the second beginning\r\nin 1866. These contain numerous papers involving the discussion of the\r\nNorthmen voyages, including a condensed narrative by Rafn, “Mémoire sur\r\nla découverte de l’Amérique au 10^e siècle,” which was enlarged and\r\nfrequently issued separately in French and other languages (1838-1843),\r\nand is sometimes found in English as a _Supplement to the Antiquitates\r\nAmericanæ_, and was issued in New York (1838) as _America discovered\r\nin the tenth century_. In this form (_Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc._, viii.\r\n187) it was widely used here and in Europe to call attention to Rafn’s\r\nfolio, _Antiquitates Americanæ_.\r\n\r\nThe _Mémoires_ also contained another paper by Rafn, _Aperçu de\r\nl’ancienne géographie des régions arctiques de l’Amérique, selon les\r\nrapports contenus dans les Sagas du Nord_ (Copenhagen, 1847), which\r\nalso concerns the Vinland voyages, and is repeated in the _Nouvelles\r\nAnnales des Voyages_ (1849), i. 277.\r\n\r\n[632] _Antiqvitates Americanæ sive scriptores septentrionales rerum\r\nante-Columbianarum in America.

An\r\nabstract of the evidence is given in the _Journal of the Royal\r\nGeographical Society_ (viii. 114), and it is upon this that H. H.\r\nBancroft depends in his _Native Races_ (v. 106). Cf. also _Ibid._ v.\r\n115-116; and his _Cent. America_, i. 74. L. Dussieux in his _Les Grands\r\nFaits de l’Histoire de la Géographie_ (Paris, 1882; vol. i. 147, 165)\r\nfollows Rafn and Malte-Brun. So does Brasseur de Bourbourg in his\r\n_Hist. de Nations Civilisées_, i. 18; and Bachiller y Morales in his\r\n_Antigüedades Americanas_ (Havana, 1845).\r\n\r\nGreat efforts were made by Rafn and his friends to get reviews of his\r\nfolio in American periodicals; and he relied in this matter upon Dr.\r\nWebb and others, with whom he had been in correspondence in working up\r\nhis geographical details (_Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc._, ii. 97, 107; viii.\r\n189, etc.), and so late as 1852 he drafted in English a new synopsis\r\nof the evidence, and sent it over for distribution in the United\r\nStates (_Ibid._ ii. 500; _New Jersey Hist. Soc. Proc._, vi.; _N. E.\r\nHist. Geneal. Reg._, 1853, p. 13). So far as weight of character went,\r\nthere was a plenty of it in his reviewers: Edward Everett in the _No.\r\nAmer. Rev._, Jan., 1838; Alexander Everett in the _U. S. Magazine and\r\nDemocratic Review_ (1838); George Folsom in the _N. Y. Review_ (1838);\r\nH. R. Schoolcraft in the _Amer.

Humboldt expresses the opinion that Columbus, during his\r\nvisit to Iceland, got no knowledge of the stories, so little an\r\nimpression had they made on the public mind (_Cosmos_, Bohn, ii.\r\n611), and that the enemies of Columbus in his famous lawsuit, when\r\nevery effort was made to discredit his enterprise, did not instance\r\nhis Iceland experience, should be held to indicate that no one in\r\nsouthern Europe believed in any such prompting at that time. Wheaton\r\nand Prescott (_Ferdinand and Isabella_, orig. ed., ii. 118, 131) hold\r\nsimilar opinions. (Cf. Vol. II. p. 33.) Dr. Webb says that Irving\r\nheld back from accepting the stories of the saga, for fear that they\r\ncould be used to detract from Columbus’ fame. Rafn and his immediate\r\nsympathizers did not fail to make the most of the supposition that\r\nColumbus had in some way profited by his Iceland experience. Laing\r\nthinks Columbus must have heard of the voyages, and De Costa (_Columbus\r\nand the Geographers of the North_) thinks that the bruit of the\r\nNorthmen voyages extended sufficiently over Europe to render it\r\nunlikely that it escaped the ears of Columbus. Cf. further an appendix\r\nin Irving’s _Columbus_, and Mallet’s _Northern Antiquities_, Bohn’s\r\ned., 267, in refutation of the conclusions of Finn Magnusen in the\r\n_Nordisk Tidsskrift_. It has been left for the unwise and overtopped\r\nadvocates of a later day, like Goodrich and Marie A. Brown, to go\r\nbeyond reason in an indiscriminate denunciation of the Genoese. The\r\nlatter writer, in her _Icelandic Discoverers of America_ (Boston,\r\n1888), rambles over the subject in a jejune way, and easily falls into\r\nerrors, while she pursues her main purpose of exposing what she fancies\r\nto be a deep-laid scheme of the Pope and the Catholic Church to conceal\r\nthe merits of the Northmen and to capture the sympathies of Americans\r\nin honoring the memory of Columbus in 1892. It is simply a reactionary\r\ncraze from the overdone raptures of the school of Roselly de Lorgues\r\nand the other advocates of the canonization of Columbus, in Catholic\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[634] This book is for the sagas the basis of the most useful book\r\non the subject, Edmund Farwell Slafter’s _Voyages of the Northmen\r\nto America_. _Including extracts from Icelandic Sagas relating to\r\nWestern voyages by Northmen in the 10th and 11th centuries in an\r\nEnglish translation by Nathaniel Ludlow Beamish; with a synopsis of\r\nthe historical evidence and the opinion of professor Rafn as to the\r\nplaces visited by the Scandinavians on the coast of America_. _With\r\nan introduction_ (Boston, 1877), published by the Prince Society.\r\nSlafter’s opinion is that the narratives are “true in their general\r\noutlines and important features.”\r\n\r\n[635] _Island, Huitramannaland, Grönland und Vinland_ (Heidelberg,\r\n1842).\r\n\r\n[636] _Die Entdeckung von Amerika durch die Isländer im zehnten\r\nund eilften Jahrhundert_ (Braunschweig, 1844).

An April hoax which appeared\r\nin a Washington paper in 1867, about some runes discovered on the\r\nPotomac, had been promptly exposed in this country (_Hist.

In a later monograph,\r\n_Les Normands sur la route des Indes_ (Rouen, 1880), Gravier, while\r\nstill accepting the old exploded geographical theories, undertook\r\nfurther to prove that the bruits of the Norse discoveries instigated\r\nthe seamen of Normandy to similar ventures, and that they visited\r\nAmerica in ante-Columbian days.\r\n\r\n[642] There is an authorized German version, _Die erste Entdeckung von\r\nAmerika_, by Mathilde Mann (Hamburg, 1888).\r\n\r\n[643] _American in Iceland_ (Boston, 1876).\r\n\r\n[644] _Land of Desolation_ (New York, 1872).

Brinton in _Amer.\r\nAntiquarian_, May, 1885.\r\n\r\n[662] Mr. Mitchell, of the U. S. Coast Survey, has attended to this\r\npart of the subject, and Horsford (p. 28) quotes his MS. He finds on\r\nthe Massachusetts coast what he thinks a sufficient correspondence to\r\nthe description of the sagas.\r\n\r\n[663] So plain a matter as the length of the longest summer day would\r\nindubitably point to an absolute parallel of latitude as determining\r\nthe site of Vinland, if there was no doubt in the language of the saga.\r\nUnfortunately there is a wide divergence of opinion in the meaning of\r\nthe words to be depended upon, even among Icelandic scholars; and the\r\nlater writers among them assert that Rafn (_Antiq. Amer._ 436) and\r\nMagnusen in interpreting the language to confirm their theory of the\r\nRhode Island bays have misconceived. Their argument is summarized in\r\nthe French version of Wheaton. John M’Caul translated Finn Magnusen’s\r\n“Ancient Scandinavian divisions of the times of day,” in the _Mémoire\r\nde la Soc. Roy. des Antiq. du Nord_ (1836-37). Rask disputes Rafn’s\r\ndeductions (_Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc._, xviii. 22). Torfæus, who is our\r\nbest commentator after all, says it meant Newfoundland. Robertson put\r\nit at 58° north. Dahlmann in his _Forschungen_ (vol. i.) places it\r\non the coast of Labrador. Horsford (p. 66) at some length admits no\r\nquestion that it must have been between 41° and 43° north. Cf. Laing’s\r\n_Heimskringla_, i. 173; Palfrey’s _New England_, i. 55; De Costa’s\r\n_Pre-Columbian Disc._, p. 33; Weise’s _Discoveries of America_, 31;\r\nand particularly Vigfússon in his _English-Icelandic Dictionary_ under\r\n“Eykt.”\r\n\r\n[664] “The discovery of America,” says Laing (_Heimskringla_, i. 154),\r\n“rests entirely upon documentary evidence which cannot, as in the\r\ncase of Greenland, be substantiated by anything to be discovered in\r\nAmerica.” Laing and many of the commentators, by some strange process\r\nof reasoning, have determined that the proof of these MS. records\r\nbeing written before Columbus’ visit to Iceland in 1477 is sufficient\r\nto establish the priority of discovery for the Northmen, as if it was\r\nnothing in the case that the sagas may or may not be good history; and\r\nnothing that it was the opinion entertained in Europe at that time that\r\nGreenland and the more distant lands were not a new continent, but a\r\nprolongation of Europe by the north. It is curious, too, to observe\r\nthat, treating of events after 1492, Laing is quite willing to believe\r\nin any saga being “filled up and new invented,” but is quite unwilling\r\nto believe anything of the kind as respects those written anterior to\r\n1492; and yet he goes on to prove conclusively that the _Flatoyensis\r\nCodex_ is full of fable, as when the saga man makes the eider-duck lay\r\neggs where during the same weeks the grapes ripen and intoxicate when\r\nfresh, and the wheat forms in the ear! Laing nevertheless rests his\r\ncase on the _Flatoyensis Codex_ in its most general scope, and calls\r\npoets, but not antiquaries, those who attempt to make any additional\r\nevidence out of imaginary runes or the identification of places.\r\n\r\n[665] It must be remembered that this divergence was not so wide to the\r\nNorthmen as it seems to us. With them the Atlantic was sometimes held\r\nto be a great basin that was enclasped from northwestern Europe by a\r\nprolongation of Scandinavia into Greenland, Helluland, and Markland,\r\nand it was a question if the more distant region of Vinland did not\r\nbelong rather to the corresponding prolongation of Africa on the south.\r\nCf. De Costa, _Pre-Columbian Disc._, 108; _Hist. Mag._, xiii. 46.\r\n\r\n[666] He wrote “Here for the first time will be found indicated the\r\nprecise spot where the ancient Northmen held their intercourse.” The\r\ncommittee of the Mass. Hist. Soc. objected to this extreme confidence.\r\n_Proceedings_, ii. 97, 107, 500, 505.\r\n\r\n[667] Reproduction of part of the plate in the _Antiquitates\r\nAmericanæ_, after a drawing by J. R.

Cotton Mather, in a\r\ndedicatory epistle to Sir Henry Ashurst, prefixed to his _Wonderful\r\nWorks of God commemorated_ (Boston, 1690), gave a cut of a part of\r\nthe inscription; and he communicated an account with a drawing of\r\nthe inscription to the Royal Society in 1712, which appears in their\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_. Dr. Isaac Greenwood sent another draft to\r\nthe Society of Antiquaries in London in 1730, and their _Transactions_\r\nin 1732 has this of Greenwood. In 1768 Professor Stephen Sewall of\r\nCambridge made a copy of the natural size, which was sent in 1774 by\r\nProfessor James Winthrop to the Royal Society. Dr. Stiles says that\r\nSewall sent it to Gebelin, of the French Academy, whose members judged\r\nthem to be Punic characters. Stiles himself, in 1783, in an election\r\nsermon delivered at Hartford, spoke of “the visit by the Phœnicians,\r\nwho charged the Dighton Rock and other rocks in Narragansett Bay with\r\nPunic inscriptions remaining to this day, which last I myself have\r\nrepeatedly seen and taken off at large.” Cf. Thornton’s _Pulpit of\r\nthe Revolution_, p. 410. The _Archæologia_ (London, viii. for 1786)\r\ngave various drawings, with a paper by the Rev. Michael Lort and some\r\nnotes by Charles Vallancey, in which the opinion was expressed that\r\nthe inscription was the work of a people from Siberia, driven south by\r\nhordes of Tartars. Professor Winthrop in 1788 filled the marks, as he\r\nunderstood them, with printer’s ink, and in this way took an actual\r\nimpression of the inscription. His copy was engraved in the _Memoirs\r\nof the American Academy of Arts and Sciences_ (vol. ii. for 1793). It\r\nwas this copy by Winthrop which Washington in 1789 saw at Cambridge,\r\nwhen he pronounced the inscription as similar to those made by the\r\nIndians, which he had been accustomed to see in the western country\r\nduring his life as a surveyor. Cf. _Belknap Papers, Mass. Hist. Soc.\r\nColl._, ii. 76, 77, 81; _Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc._, x. 114. In 1789\r\nthere was also presented to the Academy a copy made by Joseph Gooding\r\nunder the direction of Francis Baylies (_Belknap Papers_, ii. 160). In\r\nthe third volume of the Academy’s _Memoirs_ there are papers on the\r\ninscription by John Davis and Edward A. Kendall; Davis (1807) thinking\r\nit a representation of an Indian deer hunt, and Kendall later, in his\r\n_Travels_ (vol. ii. 1809), assigns it to the Indians. This description\r\nis copied in Barber’s _Historical Collections of Mass._ (p. 117). In\r\n1812 a drawing was made by Job Gardner, and in 1825 there was further\r\ndiscussion in the _Mémoires de la Société de Géographie de Paris_, and\r\nin the _Hist. of New York_ by Yates and Moulton. In 1831 there was\r\na cut in Ira Hill’s _Antiquities of America explained_ (Hagerstown,\r\nMd.) This was in effect the history of the interest in the rock up to\r\nthe appearance of Rafn’s _Antiquitates Americanæ_, in which for the\r\nfirst time the inscription was represented as being the work of the\r\nNorthmen. This belief is now shared by few, if any, temperate students.\r\nThe exuberant Anderson thinks that the rock removes all doubt of the\r\nNorthmen discovery (_America not discovered by Columbus_, pp. 21, 23,\r\n83). The credulous Gravier has not a doubt. Cf. his _Notice sur le roc\r\nde Dighton et le séjour des Scandinaves en Amérique au commencement du\r\nXI^e siècle_ (Nancy, 1875), reprinted from the _Compte Rendu, Congrès\r\ndes Américanistes_, i. 166, giving Rafn’s drawing. The Rev. J. P.\r\nBodfish accepts its evidence in the _Proc. Second Pub. Meeting U. S.\r\nCath. Hist. Soc._ (N. Y., 1886).\r\n\r\n[678] _Pre-Columbian Discovery of America_, p. lvii. The _Brinley\r\nCatalogue_, iii. 5378, gives Dammartin’s _Explification de la Pierre\r\nde Taunston_ (Paris? 1840-50) as finding in the inscription an\r\nastronomical theme by some nation foreign to America. Buckingham Smith\r\nbelieved it to be a Roman Catholic invocation, around which the Indians\r\nlater put their symbols (_Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, Apr. 29, 1863, p.\r\n32). For discussions more or less extensive see Laing’s _Heimskringla_,\r\ni. 175; Haven in _Smithsonian Contributions_, 1856, viii. 133, in a\r\npaper on the “Archæology of the United States;” Charles Rau in _Mag.\r\nAmer.

He showed\r\nGooding’s drawing to an Algonkin chief, who found in it a record of a\r\nbattle of the Indians, except that some figures near the centre did\r\nnot belong to it, and these Schoolcraft thought might be runic, as De\r\nCosta has later suggested; but in 1853 Schoolcraft made no reservation\r\nin pronouncing it entirely Indian (_Indian Tribes_, i. 112; iv. 120;\r\npl. 14). Wilson (_Prehist. Man_, ii., ch. 19) is severe on Schoolcraft.\r\nOn the general character of Indian rock inscriptions,—some of which\r\nin the delineations accompanying these accounts closely resemble the\r\nDighton Rock,—see Mallery in the _Bureau of Ethnology, Fourth Report_,\r\np. 19; Lieut.

G. Hatfield (_Scribner’s Monthly_, Mar., 1879) in\r\nan illustrated paper undertook to show by comparison with Scandinavian\r\nbuilding that what is now standing is but the central part of a Vinland\r\nbaptistery, and that the projection which supported the radiating roof\r\ntimbers is still to be seen. This paper was answered by George C. Mason\r\n(_Mag. Amer. Hist._, iii. 541, Sept., 1879, with other remarks in the\r\n_Amer. Architect_, Oct. 4, 1879), who rehearsed the views of the local\r\nantiquaries as to its connection with Gov. Arnold. Cf. _Reminiscences\r\nof Newport_, by Geo. C. Mason, 1884.\r\n\r\n[681] _Hist.

Humboldt holds them to have been driven across\r\nAmerica to Europe (_Views of Nature_, Bohn’s ed., 123). Ethnologists\r\nare not wholly agreed as to the course of their migrations. The\r\nmaterial for the ethnological study of the Eskimos must be looked\r\nfor in the narratives of the Arctic voyagers, like Scoresby, Parry,\r\nRoss, O’Reilly, Kane, C. F. Hall, and the rest; in the accounts\r\nby the missionaries like Egede, Crantz, and others; by students\r\nof ethnology, like Lubbock (_Prehist.

Cf.\r\nMurray’s _Distribution of Animals_, 128; Howarth’s _Mammoth and Flood_,\r\n285.\r\n\r\n[686] Rink, born in 1819 in Copenhagen, spent much of the interval\r\nfrom 1853 to 1872 in Greenland. Pilling (_Bibl. Eskimo Language_, p.\r\n80) gives the best account of Rink’s publications. His principal book\r\nis _Grönland geographisch und statistisch beschrieben_ (Stuttgart,\r\n1860). The English reader has access to his _Tales and Traditions of\r\nthe Eskimo_, translated by Rink himself, and edited by Dr. Robert Brown\r\n(London, 1875); to _Danish Greenland, its people and its products_, ed.\r\nby Dr. Brown (London, 1877). Rink says of this work that in its English\r\ndress it must be considered a new book. He also published _The Eskimo\r\ntribes; their distribution and characteristics, especially in regard to\r\nlanguage. With a comparative vocabulary_ (Copenhagen, etc., 1887). He\r\nalso considered their dialects as divulging the relationship of tribes\r\nin the _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_ (xv. 239); and in the\r\nsame journal (1872, p. 104) he has written of their descent. Rink also\r\nfurnished to the _Compte Rendu, Congrès des Américanistes_, a paper on\r\nthe traditions of Greenland (Nancy, 1875, ii. 181), and (Luxembourg,\r\n1877, ii. 327) another on “L’habitat primitif des Esquimaux.”\r\n\r\nDr. Brown has also considered the “Origin of the Eskimo” in the\r\n_Archæological Review_ (1888), no. 4.\r\n\r\n[687] _Alaska and its Resources_, p. 374; and in _Contributions to\r\nAmer.

Pilling’s Eskimo Bibliog., p. 12; and for linguistic\r\nevidences of tribal differences, pp. 69-72, 81-82. Cf. also H. H.\r\nBancroft’s _Native Races_, iii. 574, and Lucien Adam’s “En quoi la\r\nlangue Esquimaude, deffère-t-elle grammaticalement des autres langues\r\nde l’Amérique du Nord?” in the _Compte Rendu, Congrès des Amér._\r\n(Copenhagen), p. 337.\r\n\r\nAnton von Etzel’s _Grönland, geographisch und statistisch beschrieben\r\naus Dänischen Quellschriften_ (Stuttgart, 1860) goes cursorily over the\r\nearly history, and describes the Eskimos. Cf. F. Schwatka in _Amer.\r\nMagazine_, Aug., 1888.\r\n\r\n[690] There is an easy way of tracing these accounts in Joel A. Allen’s\r\n_List of Works and Papers relating to the mammalian orders of Cete and\r\nSirenia_, extracted from the _Bulletin of Hayden’s U. S. Geol. and\r\nGeog. Survey_ (Washington, 1882). It is necessary to bear in mind that\r\nSpitzbergen is often called Greenland in these accounts.\r\n\r\n[691] His book, _Det gamle Grönlands nye Perlustration_, etc., was\r\nfirst published at Copenhagen in 1729. Pilling (_Bibliog. of the Eskimo\r\nlanguage_, p. 26) was able to find only a single copy of this book,\r\nthat in the British Museum. Muller (_Books on America_, Amsterdam,\r\n1872, no. 648) describes a copy. This first edition escaped the notice\r\nof J. A. Allen, whose list is very carefully prepared (nos. 217, 220,\r\n226, 230, 235). There were two German editions of this original form\r\nof the book, Frankfort, 1730, and Hamburg, 1740, according to the\r\n_Carter-Brown Catalogue_ (ii. 448, 647), but Pilling gives only the\r\nfirst. The 1729 edition was enlarged in the Copenhagen edition of 1741,\r\nwhich has a map, “Gronlandia Antiqua,” showing the east colony and west\r\ncolony, respectively, east and west of Cape Farewell. This edition is\r\nthe basis of the various translations: In German, Copenhagen, 1742,\r\nusing the plates of the 1741 ed.; Berlin, 1763. In Dutch, Delft, 1746.\r\nIn French, Copenhagen, 1763. In English, London, 1745; abstracted in\r\nthe _Philosoph. Transactions Royal Soc._ (1744), xlii. no. 47; and\r\nagain, London (1818), with an historical introduction based on Torfæus\r\nand La Peyrère. Crantz epitomizes Egede’s career in Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe bibliography in Sabin’s _Dictionary_ (vi. 22,018, etc.) confounds\r\nthe Greenland journal (1770-78) of Hans Egede’s grandson, Hans Egede\r\nSaabye (b. 1746; d. 1817), with the work of the grandfather. This\r\njournal is of importance as regards the Eskimos and the missions\r\namong them. There is an English version: _Greenland: extracts from\r\na journal kept in 1770 to 1778. Prefixed an introduction; illus. by\r\nchart of Greenland, by G. Fries. Transl. from the German_ _[by H. E.\r\nLloyd]_ (London, 1818). The map follows that of the son of Hans, Paul\r\nEgede, whose _Nachrichten von Grönland aus einem Tagebuche von Bischof\r\nPaul Egede_ (Copenhagen, 1790) must also be kept distinct. Pilling’s\r\n_Bibliog. of the Eskimo language_ affords the best guide.\r\n\r\n[692] An English translation by Macdougall was published in London in\r\n1837 (Pilling, p. 38; Field, no. 619). A French version of Graah’s\r\nintroduction with notes by M. de la Roquette was published in 1835.\r\nCf. _Journal Royal Geog. Soc._, i. 247. After Graah’s publication Rafn\r\nplaced the Osterbygden on the west coast in his map. Graah’s report\r\n(1830) is in French in the _Bull. de la Soc. de Géog. de Paris_, 1830.\r\n\r\n[693] On the present scant, if not absence of, population on the east\r\ncoast of Greenland, see J. D. Whitney’s _Climatic Changes of later\r\ngeological times_ (_Mus. of Comp. Zoöl. Mem._, vii. p. 303, Cambridge,\r\n1882).\r\n\r\n[694] The changes in opinion respecting the sites of the colonies and\r\nthe successive explorations are followed in the _Compte Rendu, Congrès\r\ndes Américanistes_ by Steenstrup (p. 114) and by Valdemar-Schmidt,\r\n“Sur les Voyages des Danois au Groenland” (195, 205, with references).\r\nCf. on these lost colonies and the search for them _Westminster\r\nReview_, xxvii. 139; _Harper’s Monthly_, xliv. 65 (by I. I. Hayes);\r\n_Lippincott’s Mag._, Aug., 1878; _Amer. Church Rev._, xxi. 338; and in\r\nthe general histories, La Peyrère (Dutch transl., Amsterdam, 1678);\r\nCrantz (Eng. transl., 1767, p. 272); Egede (Eng. ed., 1818, introd.);\r\nand Rink’s _Danish Greenland_, ch. 1.\r\n\r\n[695] The original of Bardsen’s account has disappeared, but Rafn puts\r\nit in Latin, translating from an early copy found in the Faröe Islands\r\n(_Antiquitates Américanæ_, p. 300). Purchas gives it in English, from\r\na copy which had belonged to Hudson, being translated from a Dutch\r\nversion which Hudson had borrowed, the Dutch being rendered by Barentz\r\nfrom a German version. Major also prints it in _Voyages of the Zeni_.\r\nHe recognizes in Bardsen’s “Gunnbiorn’s Skerries” the island which is\r\nmarked in Ruysch’s map (1507) as blown up in 1456 (see Vol. III. p. 9).\r\n\r\n[696] Hakluyt, however, prints some pertinent verses by Meredith, a\r\nWelsh bard, in 1477.\r\n\r\n[697] _Murphy Catal._, no. 1489; Sabin, x. p. 322; _Carter-Brown\r\nCatal._ for eds. of 1584, 1697, 1702, 1774, 1811, 1832, etc.\r\n\r\n[698] In the seventeenth century there were a variety of symptoms of\r\nthe English eagerness to get the claims of Madoc substantiated, as in\r\nSir Richard Hawkins’s _Observations_ (Hakluyt Soc., 1847), and James\r\nHowell’s _Familiar Letters_ (London, 1645). Belknap (_Amer. Biog._,\r\n1794, i. p. 58) takes this view of Hakluyt’s purpose; but Pinkerton,\r\n_Voyages_, 1812, xii. 157, thinks such a charge an aspersion. The\r\nsubject was mentioned with some particularity or incidentally by\r\nPurchas, Abbott (_Brief Description_, London, 1620, 1634, 1677), Smith\r\n(_Virginia_), and Fox (_North-West Fox_). Sir Thomas Herbert in his\r\n_Relation of some Travaile into Africa and Asia_ (London, 1634) tracks\r\nMadoc to Newfoundland, and he also found Cymric words in Mexico, which\r\nassured him in his search for further proofs (Bohn’s _Lowndes_, p.\r\n1049; Carter-Brown, ii. 413, 1166).\r\n\r\nThe _Nieuwe en onbekende Weereld_ of Montanus (Amsterdam, 1671) made\r\nthe story more familiar. It necessarily entered into the discussions\r\nof the learned men who, in the seventeenth century, were busied with\r\nthe question of the origin of the Americans, as in De Laet’s _Notæ\r\nad dissertationem Hugonis Grotii_ (Paris, 1643), who is inclined to\r\nbelieve the story, as is Hornius in his _De Originibus Americaniis_\r\n(1652).\r\n\r\n[699] Cf. Catlin’s _No. Amer. Indians_, i. 207; ii. 259, 262.\r\n\r\n[700] _Gentleman’s Magazine_. It is reprinted in H. H. Bancroft’s\r\n_Native Races_, v. 119, and in Baldwin’s _Anc. America_, 286. Cf.\r\nJohn Paul Marana, Letters writ by a Turkish Spy, 1691, and later.\r\nThe story had been told in _The British Sailors’ Directory_ in 1739\r\n(Carter-Brown, iii. 599).\r\n\r\n[701] Warden’s _Recherches_, p. 157; Amos Stoddard’s _Sketches of\r\nLouisiana_ (Philad., 1812), ch. 17, and _Philad.

Y., 1846) found Welsh traces\r\nin the speech of the Mowquas, and S. Y. McMaster in _Smithsonian\r\nRept._, 1865, heard Welsh sounds among the Navajos.\r\n\r\n[711] Filson in his _Kentucke_ has also pointed out this possibility.\r\n\r\n[712] The bibliography of the subject can be followed in Watson’s\r\nlist, already referred to, and in that in the _Amer.

It was held to be a confirmation of the\r\nchart that both the east and west Greenland colonies were on the side\r\nof Davis’s Straits.\r\n\r\n[715] Buache reproduced the map, and read in 1784, before the Academy\r\nof Inscriptions in Paris, his _Mémoire sur la Frisland_, which was\r\nprinted by the Academy in 1787, p. 430.\r\n\r\n[716] _Dissertazione intorno ai viaggi e scoperte settentrionali\r\ndi Nicolo e Antonio Fratelli Zeni._ This paper was substantially\r\nreproduced in the same writer’s _Di Marco Polo e degli altri\r\nViaggiatori veneziani più illustri dissertazioni_ (Venice, 1818).\r\n\r\n[717] _Annales des Voyages_ (1810), x. 72; _Précis de la Géographie_\r\n(1817).\r\n\r\n[718] _Nordisk Tidsskrift for Oldkyndighed_ (Copenhagen, 1834), vol. i.\r\np. 1; _Royal Geog.

Soc. Journal_, 1873)\r\non “The Site of the Lost Colony of Greenland determined, and the\r\npre-Columbian discoveries of America confirmed, from fourteenth century\r\ndocuments,” used the Zeno account and map in connection with Ivan\r\nBardsen’s Sailing Directions in placing the missing colony near Cape\r\nFarewell. Major epitomized his views on the question in _Mass. Hist.\r\nSoc. Proc._, Oct., 1874. Sir H. C. Rawlinson commented on Major’s views\r\nin his address before the Royal Geog. Society (_Journal_, 1873, p.\r\nclxxxvii).\r\n\r\nStevens (_Bibl.

This last represents “Islandia” lying midway\r\nalone in the sea between “Norwegica Regio” and “Gronlandia provincia.”\r\nThe “Congelatum mare” is made to flow north of Norway, so as almost\r\nto meet the northern Baltic, while north of this frozen sea is an\r\nArctic region, of which Greenland is but an extension south and\r\nwest. The student will find these and other maps making part of the\r\naddress already referred to, which also makes part in German of his\r\n_Studien und Forschungen veranlasst durch meine Reisen im hohen Norden,\r\nautorisirte deutsche Ausgabe_ (Leipzig, 1885). The maps accompanying\r\nit not already referred to are the usual Ptolemy map of the north of\r\nEurope, based on a MS. of the fourteenth century; the “Scandinavia”\r\nfrom the _Isolario_ of Bordone, 1547; that of the world in the MS.\r\n_Insularium illustratum_ of Henricus Martellus, of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, in the British Museum, copied from the sketch in José de\r\nLacerda’s _Exame dos Viagens do Doutor Livingstone_ (Lisbon, 1867); the\r\n“Scandinavia” and the “Carta Marina” in the Venetian Ptolemy of 1548;\r\nthe map of Olaus Magnus in 1567; the chart of Andrea Bianco (1436);\r\nthe map of the Basle ed. (1532) of Grynæus’ _Novis Orbis_; that of\r\nLaurentius Frisius (1524).

Forster calls it Newfoundland. Beauvois (_Les colonies\r\nEuropéenes du Markland at de l’Escociland_) makes it include Maine,\r\nNew Brunswick, and part of Lower Canada. These are the chief varieties\r\nof belief. Steenstrup is of those who do not recognize America at all.\r\nHornius, among the older writers, thought that Scotland or Shetland\r\nwas more likely to have been the fisherman’s strange country. Santarem\r\n(_Hist. de la Cartographie_, iii. 141) points out an island, “Y\r\nStotlandia,” in the Baltic, as shown on the map of Giovanni Leardo\r\n(1448) at Venice.\r\n\r\nIn P. B. Watson’s _Bibliog. of Pre-Columbian Discoveries of America_\r\nthere is the fullest but not a complete list on the subject, and from\r\nthis and other sources a few further references may be added: Belknap’s\r\n_Amer.

Bancroft (v. 97) epitomizes its recital, following Bertrand’s\r\n_Mémoires_. There is a repetition of the old arguments in a sermon,\r\n_Increase of the Kingdom of Christ_ (N.

Even the Western mounds have\r\nbeen made to yield Hebrew inscriptions (_Congrès des Amér._, Nancy, ii.\r\n192).\r\n\r\nMany of the general treatises on the origin of the Americans have set\r\nforth the opposing arguments. Garcia did it fairly in his _Origen de\r\nlos Indios_ (1607; ed. by Barcia, 1729), and Bancroft (v. 78-84) has\r\ncondensed his treatment. Brasseur (_Hist. Nat. Civ._, i. 17) rejects\r\nthe theory of the ten tribes; but is not inclined to abandon a belief\r\nin some scattered traces. Short (pp. 135, 144) epitomizes the claims.\r\nGaffarel covers them in his _Etude sur les rapports de l’Amérique_ (p.\r\n87) with references, and these last are enlarged in Bancroft’s _Nat.\r\nRaces_, v. 95-97.\r\n\r\n[746] Varnhagen’s _L’origine touranienne des Américains Tupis-Caraïbes\r\net des anciens Egyptiens, indiquée principalement par la philologie\r\ncomparée: traces d’une ancienne migration en Amérique, invasion du\r\nBrésil par les Tupis_ (Vienne, 1876).

It is preserved in\r\nthe Biblioteca Marciana at Venice. It was made by Mauro under the\r\ncommand of Don Alonso V., and Bianco assisted him. The exact date is\r\nin dispute; but all agree to place it between 1457 and 1460. A copy\r\nwas made on vellum in 1804, which is now in the British Museum. Our\r\ncut follows one corner of the reproduction in Santarem’s _Atlas_. A\r\nphotographic fac-simile has been issued in Venice by Ongania, and St.\r\nMartin (_Atlas_, p. vii) follows this fac-simile.

Cf. the bibliography\r\nof Reisch’s _Margarita Philosophia_ in Sabin’s _Dictionary_, vol.\r\nxvi., and separately, prepared by Wilberforce Eames. Reisch’s map is\r\ngiven _post_, Vol. II. p. 114. Another sketch of this map, with an\r\nexamination of the question, where the name “Zoana Mela,” applied on it\r\nto America, came from, is given by Frank Wieser in the _Zeitschrift für\r\nWissensch.

A similar feature is in the map described by Peschel in the\r\n_Jahresbericht des Vereins für Erdkunde in Leipzig_ (1871). It is also\r\nto be seen in the Homem map of about 1540 (given in Vol. II. p. 446),\r\nand in the map which Major assigns to Baptista Agnese, and which was\r\npublished in Paris in 1875 as a _Portulan de Charles Quint._ (Cf. Vol.\r\nII. p. 445.)\r\n\r\n[770] There is a fac-simile of Ziegler’s map in Vol. II. 434; also in\r\nGoldsmid’s ed. of Hakluyt (Edinb., 1885), and in Nordenskjöld’s _Vega_,\r\ni. 52.\r\n\r\n[771] The map (1551) of Gemma Frisius in Apian is much the same.\r\n\r\n[772] In the Basle ed. of the _Historia de Gentium_. Cf. Nordenskjöld’s\r\n_Vega_, vol. i., who says that the map originally appeared in Magnus’s\r\n_Auslegung und Verklarung der Neuen Mappen von den Alten Goettenreich_\r\n(Venice, 1539); and is different from the map which appeared in the\r\nintermediate edition of 1555 at Rome, a part of which is also annexed.\r\n\r\n[773] The same is done in the Ptolemy of 1548 (Venice). There is a\r\nfac-simile in Nordenskjöld’s _Studien_, p. 35.\r\n\r\n[774] See Vol. IV. p. 84.\r\n\r\n[775] We find it in the Nancy globe of about 1540 (see Vol. IV. p. 81);\r\nin the Mercator gores of 1541 (Vol. II. p. 177); and in the Ruscelli\r\nmap of 1544 (Vol. II. p. 432), where Greenland (Grotlandia) is simply\r\na neck connecting Europe with America; and in Gastaldi “Carta Marina,”\r\nin the Italian Ptolemy of 1548, where it is a protuberance on a\r\nsimilar neck (see Vol. II. 435; IV. 43; and Nordenskjöld’s _Studien_,\r\n43). The Rotz map of 1542 seems to be based on the same material used\r\nby Mercator in his gores, but he adds a new confusion in calling\r\nGreenland the “Cost of Labrador.” Cf. Winsor’s _Kohl Maps_, no. 104.\r\nThe “Grutlandia” of the Vopellio map of 1556 is also continuous with\r\nLabrador (see Vol. II. 436; IV. 90).\r\n\r\n[776] See Vol. IV. pp. 42, 82.\r\n\r\n[777] In the edition of 1562, which repeated the map, the cartographer\r\nMoletta (Moletius) testified that its geography had been confirmed “by\r\nletters and marine charts sent to us from divers parts.”\r\n\r\n[778] Winsor’s _Bibliog. of Ptolemy_, sub anno 1561.\r\n\r\n[779] Lok’s map of 1582 calls it “Groetland,” the landfall of “Jac.\r\nScolvus,” the Pole. Cf. Vol. III. 40.\r\n\r\n[780] For Mercator’s map, see Vol. II. 452; IV. 94, 373. Ortelius’\r\nseparate map of Scandia is much the same. It is the same with the map\r\nof Phillipus Gallæus, dated 1574, but published at Antwerp in 1585 in\r\nthe _Theatri orbis terrarum Enchiridion_. Gilbert’s map in 1576 omits\r\nthe “Grocland” (Vol. III. 203). Both features, however, are preserved\r\nin the Judæis of 1593 (Vol. IV. 97), in the Wytfliet of 1597 (Vol. II.\r\n459), in Wolfe’s Linschoten in 1598 (Vol. III. 101), and in Quadus in\r\n1600 (Vol. IV. 101). In the Zaltière map of 1566 (Vol. II. 451; IV.\r\n93), in the Porcacchi map of 1572 (Vol. II. 96, 453; IV. 96), and in\r\nthat of Johannes Martines of 1578, the features are too indefinite for\r\nrecognition. Lelewel (i. pl. 7) gives a Spanish mappemonde of 1573.\r\n\r\n[781] In fac-simile in Nordenskjöld’s _Vega_, i. 247.\r\n\r\n[782] Vol. III p. 98.\r\n\r\n[783] A paper by H. Rink in the _Geografisk Tidskrift_ (viii. 139)\r\nentitled “Ostgrönländerne i deres Forhold till Vestgrönländerne og\r\nde övrige Eskimostammer,” is accompanied by drafts of the map of G.\r\nTholacius, 1606, and of Th. Thorlacius, 1668-69,—the latter placing\r\nEast Bygd on the east coast near the south end. K. J. V. Steenstrup, on\r\nOsterbygden in _Geog. Tidskrift_, viii. 123, gives facsimiles of maps\r\nof Jovis Carolus in 1634; of Hendrick Doncker in 1669. Sketches of maps\r\nby Johannes Meyer in 1652, and by Hendrick Doncker in 1666, are also\r\ngiven in the _Geografisk Tidskrift_, viii. (1885), pl. 5.\r\n\r\n[784] _Voyages des Pais Septentrionaux,_—a very popular book.\r\n\r\n[785] _Chips from a German Workshop_, i. 327.\r\n\r\n[786] _Archæological Tour_, p. 202.\r\n\r\n[787] The earliest fixed date for the founding of Tenochtitlan (Mexico\r\ncity) is 1325. Brasseur tells us that Carlos de Sigüenza y Gongora made\r\nthe first chronological table of ancient Mexican dates, which was used\r\nby Boturini, and was improved by Leon y Gama,—the same which Bustamante\r\nhas inserted in his edition of Gomara. Gallatin (_Amer. Ethnol. Soc.\r\nTrans._, i.) gave a composite table of events by dates before the\r\nConquest, which is followed in Brantz Mayer’s _Mexico as it was_, i.\r\n97. Ed. Madier de Montjau, in his _Chronologie hiéroglyphico-phonétique\r\ndes Rois Astéques de 1352 à 1522_, takes issue with Ramirez on some\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n[788] Bancroft (v. 199) gives references to those writers who have\r\ndiscussed this question of giants. Bandelier’s references are more\r\nin detail (_Arch. Tour_, p. 201). Short (p. 233) borrows largely the\r\nlist in Bancroft. The enumeration includes nearly all the old writers.\r\nAcosta finds confirmation in bones of incredible largeness, often found\r\nin his day, and then supposed to be human. Modern zoölogists say they\r\nwere those of the Mastodon. Howarth, _Mammoth and the Flood_, 297.\r\n\r\n[789] See _Native Races_, ii. 117; v. 24, 27.\r\n\r\n[790] Sometimes it is said they came from the Antilles, or beyond,\r\neasterly, and that an off-shoot of the same people appeared to the\r\nearly French, explorers as the Natchez Indians. We have, of course,\r\noffered to us a choice of theories in the belief that the Maya\r\ncivilization came from the westward by the island route from Asia. This\r\nmisty history is nothing without alternatives, and there are a plenty\r\nof writers who dogmatize about them.\r\n\r\n[791] _Constituciones diocesanas del obispado de Chiappas_ (Rome, 1702).\r\n\r\n[792] _Nat. Races_, v. 160.\r\n\r\n[793] _Hist. Nations Civilisées_, i. 37, 150, etc. _Popul Vuh_,\r\nintrod., sec. v. Bancroft relates the Votan myth, with references, in\r\n_Nat. Races_, iii. 450. Brasseur identifies the Votanites with the\r\nColhuas, as the builders of Palenqué, the founders of Xibalba, and\r\nthinks a branch of them wandered south to Peru. There are some stories\r\nof even pre-Votan days, under Igh and Imox. Cf. H. De Charency’s “Myth\r\nd’Imos,” in the _Annales de philosophie Chrétienne_, 1872-73, and\r\nreferences in Bancroft, v. 164, 231.\r\n\r\n[794] _Native Races_, ii. 121, etc.\r\n\r\n[795] Bancroft (v. 236) points to Bradford, Squier, Tylor,\r\nViollet-le-Duc, Bartlett, and Müller, with Brasseur in a qualified way,\r\nas in the main agreeing in this early disjointing of the Nashua stock,\r\nby which the Maya was formed through separation from the older race.\r\n\r\n[796] Enforced, for instance, by one of the best of the later Mexican\r\nwriters, Orozco y Berra, in his _Geografía de las lenguas y Carta\r\nEthnografica de México_ (Mexico, 1865).\r\n\r\n[797] Tylor, _Anahuac_, 189, and his _Early Hist. Mankind_, 184. Orozco\r\ny Berra, _Geog._, 124. Bancroft, v. 169, note. The word Maya was first\r\nheard by Columbus in his fourth voyage, 1503-4. We sometimes find it\r\nwritten Mayab. It is usual to class the people of Yucatan, and even\r\nthe Quiché-Cakchiquels of Guatemala and those of Nicaragua, under the\r\ncomprehensive term of Maya, as distinct from the Nahua people farther\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\n[798] _Nat. Races_, v. 186.\r\n\r\n[799] Brinton, with his view of myths, speaks of the attempt of the\r\nAbbé Brasseur to make Xibalba an ancient kingdom, with Palenqué as its\r\ncapital, as utterly unsupported and wildly hypothetical (_Myths_, 251).\r\n\r\n[800] Perhaps by Gucumatz (who is identified by some with\r\nQuetzalcoatl), leading the Tzequiles, who are said to have appeared\r\nfrom somewhere during one of Votan’s absences, and to have grown into\r\npower among the Chanes, or Votan’s people, till they made Tulan, where\r\nthey lived, too powerful for the Votanites. Bancroft (v. 187) holds\r\nthis view against Brasseur.\r\n\r\n[801] Perhaps Ococingo, or Copan, as Bancroft conjectures (v. 187).\r\n\r\n[802] As Sahagún calls it, meaning, as Bancroft suggests, Tabasco.\r\n\r\n[803] Short (p. 248) points out that the linguistic researches of\r\nOrozco y Berra (_Geografía de las Lenguas de México_, 1-76) seem to\r\nconfirm this.\r\n\r\n[804] See p. 158.\r\n\r\n[805] Kirk says (Prescott’s _Mexico_): “Confusion arises from the name\r\nof Chichimec, originally that of a single tribe, and subsequently of\r\nits many offshoots, being also used to designate successive hordes of\r\nwhatever race.” Some have seen in the Waiknas of the Mosquito Coast,\r\nand in the Caribs generally, descendants of these Chichimecs who have\r\nkept to their old social level. The Caribs, on other authority, came\r\noriginally from the stock of the Tupis and Guaranis, who occupied\r\nthe region south of the Amazon, and in Columbus’s time they were\r\nscattered in Darien and Honduras, along the northern regions of South\r\nAmerica, and in some of the Antilles (Von Martius, _Beiträge sur\r\nEthnographie and Sprachenkunde Amerika’s zumal Brasilìens_, Leipzig,\r\n1867). Bancroft (ii. 126) gives the etymology of Chichimec and of other\r\ntribal designations. Cf. Buschmann’s _Ueber die Aztekischen Ortsnamen_\r\n(Berlin, 1853). Bandelier (_Archæol. Tour_, 200; _Peabody Mus. Repts._,\r\nii. 393) says he fails to discover in the word anything more than a\r\ngeneral term, signifying a savage, a hunter, or a warrior, Chichimecos,\r\napplied to roving tribes. Brasseur says that Mexican tradition applies\r\nthe term Chichimecs generically to the first occupants of the New World.\r\n\r\n[806] These names wander and exchange consonants provokingly, and it\r\nmay be enough to give alphabetically a list comprised of those in\r\nPrichard (_Nat. Hist. Man_) and Orozco y Berra (_Geografía_), with\r\nsome help from Gallatin in the _American Ethno. Soc. Trans._, i.,\r\nand other groupers of the ethnological traces: Chinantecs, Chatinos,\r\nCohuixcas, Chontales, Colhuas, Coras, Cuitatecs, Chichimecs, Cuextecas\r\n(Guaxtecas, Huastecs), Mazetecs, Mazahuas, Michinacas, Miztecs,\r\nNonohualcas, Olmecs, Otomís, Papabucos, Quinames, Soltecos, Totonacs,\r\nTriquis, Tepanecs, Tarascos, Xicalancas, Zapotecs. It is not unlikely\r\nthe same people may be here mentioned under different names. The\r\ndiversity of opinions respecting the future of these vapory existences\r\nis seen in Bancroft’s collation (v. 202). Torquemada tells us about all\r\nthat we know of the Totonacs, who claim to have been the builders of\r\nTeotihuacan. Bancroft gives references (v. 204) for the Totonacs, (p.\r\n206) for the Otomís, (p. 207) for the Mistecs and Zapotecs, and (p.\r\n208) for the Huastecs.\r\n\r\n[807] Bancroft, ii. 97. Brasseur, _Nat. Civ._, i. ch. 4, and his\r\n_Palenqué_ ch. 3.\r\n\r\n[808] Called Huehue-Tlapallan, as Brasseur would have it.\r\n\r\n[809] Following Motolinía and other early writers.\r\n\r\n[810] _Native Races_, v. 219, 616.\r\n\r\n[811] Bandelier, _Archæol. Tour_, 253.\r\n\r\n[812] Kingsborough, ix. 206, 460; Veytia, i. 155, 163. Of the\r\nQuetzalcoatl myth there are references elsewhere. P. J. J. Valentini\r\nhas made a study of the early Mexican ethnology and history in his\r\n“Olmecas and Tultecas,” translated by S. Salisbury, Jr., and printed\r\nin the _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, Oct. 21, 1882. On Quetzalcoatl in\r\nCholula, see Torquemada, translated in Bancroft, iii. 258.\r\n\r\n[813] This wide difference covers intervening centuries, each of which\r\nhas its advocates. Short carries their coming back to the fourth\r\ncentury (p. 245), but Clavigero’s date of A.D. 544 is more commonly\r\nfollowed. Veytia makes it the seventh century. Bancroft (v. 211, 214)\r\nnotes the diversity of views.\r\n\r\n[814] Bancroft (v. 322) in a long note collates the different\r\nstatements of the routes and sojourns in this migration. Cf. Short, p.\r\n259.\r\n\r\n[815] Cf. Kirk in Prescott, i. 10. It must be confessed that it is\r\nrather in the domain of myth than of history that we must place all\r\nthat has been written about the scattering of the Toltec people at\r\nBabel (Bancroft, v. 19), and their finally reaching Huehue-Tlapallan,\r\nwherever that may have been. The view long prevalent about this\r\nAmerican starting-point of the Nahuas, Toltecs, or whatever designation\r\nmay be given to the beginners of this myth and history, placed it in\r\nCalifornia, but some later writers think it worth while to give it a\r\ngeographical existence in the Mississippi Valley, and to associate\r\nit in some vague way with the moundbuilders and their works (Short,\r\n_No. Amer. of Antiq._, 251, 253). There is some confusion between\r\nHuehue-Tlapallan of this story and the Tlapallan noticed in the Spanish\r\nconquest time, which was somewhere in the Usumacinta region, and if we\r\naccept Tollan, Tullan, or Tula as a form of the name, the confusion\r\nis much increased (Short, pp. 217-220). Bancroft (v. 214) says there\r\nis no sufficient data to determine the position of Huehue-Tlapallan,\r\nbut he thinks “the evidence, while not conclusive, favors the south\r\nrather than the north” (p. 216). The truth is, about these conflicting\r\nviews of a northern or southern origin, pretty much as Kirk puts it\r\n(Prescott, i. 18): “All that can be said with confidence is, that\r\nneither of the opposing theories rests on a secure and sufficient\r\nbasis.” The situation of Huehue-Tlapallan and Aztlan is very likely one\r\nand the same question, as looking to what was the starting-point of all\r\nthe Nahua migrations, extending over a thousand years.\r\n\r\n[816] Bancroft, v. 217.\r\n\r\n[817] Torquemada, Boturini, Humboldt, Brasseur, Charnay, Short, etc.\r\n\r\n[818] _Nat. Races_ (v. 222).\r\n\r\n[819] In support of the California location, Buschmann, in his\r\n_Ueber die Spuren der Aztekischen Sprache im nördlichen Mexico und\r\nhöheren Amerikanischen Norden_ (Berlin, 1854), finds traces of the\r\nMexican tongue in those of the recent California Indians. Linguistic\r\nresemblances to the Aztec, even so far north as Nootka, have been\r\ntraced, but later philologists deny the inferences of relationship\r\ndrawn from such similarity (Bancroft, iii. p. 612). The linguistic\r\nconfusion in aboriginal California is so great that there is a wide\r\nfield for tracing likenesses (_Ibid._ iii. 635). In the _California\r\nState Mining Bureau, Bulletin no. 1_ (Sacramento, 1888), Winslow\r\nAnderson gives a description of some desiccated human remains found\r\nin a sealed cave, which are supposed to be Aztec. There are slight\r\nresemblances to the Aztec in the Shoshone group of languages (Bancroft,\r\niii. 660), and the same author arranges all that has been said to\r\nconnect the Mexican tongue with those of New Mexico and neighboring\r\nregions (iii. 664). Buschmann, who has given particular attention\r\nto tracing the Aztec connections at the north, finds nothing to\r\nwarrant anything more than casual admixtures with other stocks (_Die\r\nLautveränderung Aztekischer Wörter_, Berlin, 1855, and _Die Spuren der\r\nAztekischen Sprachen_, Berlin, 1859). See Short (p. 487) for a summary.\r\n\r\n[820] Bancroft (v. 305) cites the diverse views; so does Short to some\r\nextent (pp. 246, 258, etc.). Cf. Brinton’s _Address_ on “Where was\r\nAztlan?” p. 6; Short, 486, 490; Nadaillac, 284; Wilson’s _Prehistoric\r\nMan_, i. 327.\r\n\r\nBrinton (_Myths of the New World_, etc., 89; _Amer. Hero. Myths_, 92)\r\nholds that Aztlan is a name wholly of mythical purport, which it would\r\nbe vain to seek on the terrestrial globe. This cradle region of the\r\nNahuas sometimes appears as the Seven Caves (Chicomoztoc), and Duran\r\nplaces them “in Teoculuacan, otherwise called Aztlan, a country toward\r\nthe north and connected with Florida.” The Seven Caves were explained\r\nby Sahagún as a valley, by Clavigero as a city, by Schoolcraft and\r\nothers as simply seven boats in which the first comers came from Asia;\r\nBrasseur makes them and Aztlan the same; others find them to be the\r\nseven cities of Cibola,—so enumerates Brinton (_Myths_, 227), who\r\nthinks that the seven divisions of the Nahuas sprung from the belief in\r\nthe Seven Caves, and had in reality no existence.\r\n\r\nGallatin has followed out the series of migrations in the _Amer.\r\nEthnol. Soc. Trans._, i. 162. Dawson, _Fossil Men_ (ch. 3), gives his\r\ncomprehensive views of the main directions of these early migrations.\r\nBrasseur follows the Nahuas (_Popul Vuh_, introd., sect. ix.). Winchell\r\n(_Pre-Adamites_) thinks the general tendency was from north to south.\r\nMorgan finds the origin of the Mexican tribes in New Mexico and in the\r\nSan Juan Valley (_Peabody Mus. Rept._, xii. 553. Cf. his article in\r\nthe _North Am. Rev._, Oct., 1869). Humboldt (_Views of Nature_, 207)\r\ntouches the Aztec wanderings.\r\n\r\nThere are two well-known Aztec migration maps, first published in F.\r\nG. Carreri’s _Giro del Mondo_; in English as “Voyage round the world,”\r\nin Churchill’s _Voyages_, vol. iv., concerning which see Bancroft,\r\nii. 543; iii. 68, 69; Short, 262, 431, 433; Prescott, iii. 364, 382.\r\nOrozco y Berra (_Hist. Antiq. de Mexico_, iii. 61) says that these\r\nmaps follow one another, and are not different records of the same\r\nprogress. Humboldt (_Vues_, etc., ii. 176) gives an interpretation of\r\nthem in accordance with Sigüenza’s views, which is the one usually\r\nfollowed, and Bancroft (v. 324) epitomizes it. Ramirez says that the\r\ncopies reproduced in Humboldt, Clavigero, and Kingsborough are not so\r\ncorrect as the engraving given in Garcia y Cubas’s _Atlas geogrâfico,\r\nestadistico e histórico de la Republica Mejicana_ (April, 1858).\r\nBancroft (ii. 544) gives it as reproduced by Ramirez. It is also in\r\nthe Mexican edition of Prescott, and in Schoolcraft’s _Indian Tribes_.\r\nCf. Delafield’s _Inquiry_ (N. Y., 1839) and Léon de Rosny’s _Les doc.\r\nécrits de l’antiq. Amér._ (Paris, 1882). The original is preserved in\r\nthe Museo Nacional of Mexico. A palm-tree on the map, near Aztlan,\r\nhas pointed some of the arguments in favor of a southern position for\r\nthat place, but Ramirez says it is but a part of a hieroglyphic name,\r\nand has no reference to the climate of Aztlan (Short, p. 266). F.\r\nVon Hellwald printed a paper on “American migrations,” with notes by\r\nProfessor Henry, in the _Smithsonian Report_, 1866, pp. 328-345. Short\r\ndefines as “altogether the most enlightened treatment of the subject”\r\nthe paper of John H. Becker, “Migrations des Nahuas,” in the _Compte\r\nrendu, Congrès des Américanistes_ (Luxembourg, 1877), i. 325. This\r\npaper finds an identification of the Tulan Zuiva of the Quichés, the\r\nHuehue-Tlapallan of the Toltecs, the Amaquemecan of the Chichimecs,\r\nand the Oztotlan (Aztlan) of the Aztecs in The valleys of the Rio\r\nGrande del Norte and Rio Colorado, as was Morgan’s view. Short (p. 249)\r\nsummarizes his paper. Bancroft (v. 289) shows the diversity of views\r\nrespecting Amaquemecan.\r\n\r\n[821] _Native Races_, v. 167, recapitulates the proofs against the\r\nnorthern theory. J. R. Bartlett, _Personal Narrative_, ii. 283,\r\nfinds no evidence for it. The successive sites of their sojourns as\r\nthey passed on their journeys are given as Tlapallan, Tlacutzin,\r\nTlapallanco, Jalisco, Atenco, Iztachnexuca, Tollatzinco, Tollan or\r\nTula,—the last, says Bancroft, apparently in Chiapas. If there was not\r\nsuch confusion respecting the old geography, these names might decide\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n[822] Writers usually place the beginnings of credible history at about\r\nthis period. Brasseur and the class of writers who are easily lifted\r\non their imagination talk about traces of a settled government being\r\ndiscernible at periods which they place a thousand years before Christ.\r\n\r\n[823] References in Bancroft, v. 247, with Brasseur for the main\r\ndependence, in his use of the _Codex Chimalpòpoca_ and the _Memorial de\r\nColhuacan_.\r\n\r\n[824] Charnay (Eng. trans., ch. 8 and 9) calls it a rival city of Tula\r\nor Tollan, rebuilt by the Chichimecs on the ruins of a Toltec city.\r\n\r\n[825] If one wants the details of all this, he can read it in Veytia,\r\nBrasseur (_Nat. Civilisées_ and _Palenqué_, ch. viii.), and Bancroft,\r\nthe latter giving references (v. 285).\r\n\r\n[826] It is frequently stated that there was a segregated migration to\r\nCentral America. Bancroft (v. 168, 285), who collates the authorities,\r\nfinds nothing of the kind implied. He thinks the mass remained in\r\nAnáhuac. The old view as expressed by Prescott (i. 14) was that “much\r\nthe greater number probably spread over the region of Central America\r\nand the neighboring isles, and the traveller now speculates on the\r\nmajestic ruins of Mitla and Palenqué as possibly the work of this\r\nextraordinary people.” Kirk, as Prescott’s editor, refers to the labors\r\nof Orozco y Berra (_Geografía de las Lenguas de México_, 122), followed\r\nby Tylor, (_Anahuac_, 189) as establishing the more recent view that\r\nthis southern architecture, “though of a far higher grade, was long\r\nanterior to the Toltec dominion.”\r\n\r\n[827] _Amer. Ethno. Soc. Trans._, i.\r\n\r\n[828] Bancroft (v. 287) says: “It is probable that the name Toltec, a\r\ntitle of distinction rather than a national name, was never applied at\r\nall to the common people.”\r\n\r\n[829] Brinton’s main statement is in his _Were the Toltecs an historic\r\nnationality? Read before the American Philosophical Society, Sept. 2,\r\n1887_ (Phila., 1887); published also in their _Proceedings_, 1887,\r\np. 229. Cf. also Brinton’s _Amer. Hero. Myths_ (Phil., 1882), p. 86,\r\nwhere he throws discredit on the existence of the alleged Toltec king\r\nQuetzalcoatl (whom Sahagún keeps distinct from the mythical demi-god);\r\nand earlier, in his _Myths of the New World_ (p. 29), he had suggested\r\nthat the name Toltec might have “a merely mythical signification.”\r\nCharnay, who makes the Toltecs a Nahuan tribe, had defended their\r\nhistorical status in a paper on “La Civilisation Tolteque,” in the\r\n_Revue d’Ethnographie_ (iv., 1885); and again, two years later, in\r\nthe same periodical, he reviewed adversely Brinton’s arguments. (Cf.\r\n_Saturday Review_, lxiii. 843.) Otto Stoll, in his _Guatemala, Reisen\r\nund Schilderungen_ (Leipzig, 1886), is another who rejects the old\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n[830] _Archæol. Tour_, 253.\r\n\r\n[831] _Archæol. Tour_, 7. Sahagún identifies the Toltecs with the\r\n“giants,” and if these were the degraded descendants of the followers\r\nof Votan, Sahagún thus earlier established the same identity.\r\n\r\n[832] _Archæol. Tour_, 191. The fact that the names which we associate\r\nwith the Toltecs are Nahua, only means that Nahua writers have\r\ntransmitted them, as Bandelier thinks. Cf. also Bandelier’s citation\r\nin the _Peabody Mus. Reports_, vol. ii. 388, where he speaks of\r\nour information regarding the Toltecs as “limited and obscure.” He\r\nthinks it beyond question that they were Nahuas; and the fact that\r\ntheir division of time corresponds with the system found in Yucatan,\r\nGuatemala, etc., with other evidences of myths and legends, leads him\r\nto believe that the aborigines of more southern regions were, if not\r\ndescendants, at least of the same stock with the Toltecs, and that we\r\nare justified in studying them to learn what the Toltecs were. He finds\r\nthat Veytia, in his account of the Toltecs, beside depending on Sahagún\r\nand Torquemada, finds a chief source in Ixtlilxochitl, and locates\r\nHuehue-Tlapallan in the north; and Veytia’s statements reappear in\r\nClavigero.\r\n\r\nThe best narratives of the Toltec history are those in Veytia,\r\n_Historia Antigua de Méjico_ (Mexico, 1806); Brasseur’s _Hist. Nations\r\nCivilisées_ (vol. i.), and his introduction to his _Popul Vuh_;\r\nand Bancroft (v. ch. 3 and 4): but we must look to Ixtlilxochitl,\r\nTorquemada, Sahagún, and the others, if we wish to study the sources.\r\nIn such a study we shall encounter vexatious problems enough. It is\r\npractically impossible to arrange chronologically what Ixtlilxochitl\r\nsays that he got from the picture-writings which he interpreted.\r\nBancroft (v. 209) does the best he can to give it a forced perspicuity.\r\nWilson (_Prehisoric Man_, i. 245) not inaptly says: “The history of the\r\nToltecs and their ruined edifices stands on the border line of romance\r\nand fable, like that of the ruined builders of Carnac and Avebury.”\r\n\r\n[833] Short (page 255) points out that Bancroft unadvisedly looks upon\r\nthese Chichimecs as of Nahua stock, according to the common belief.\r\nShort thinks that Pimentel (_Lenguas indigenas de México_, published\r\nin 1862) has conclusively shown that the Chichimecs did not originally\r\nspeak the Nahua tongue, but subsequently adopted it. Short (page\r\n256) thinks, after collating the evidence, that it is impossible to\r\ndetermine whence or how they came to Anáhuac.\r\n\r\n[834] Bancroft, v. 292, gives the different views. Cf. Kirk in\r\nPrescott, i. 16.\r\n\r\n[835] These events are usually one thing or another, according to the\r\noriginal source which you accept, as Bancroft shows (v. 303). The story\r\nof the text is as good as any, and is in the main borne out by the\r\nother narratives.\r\n\r\n[836] Bancroft, v. 308. Cf., on the arrival of the Mexicans in the\r\nvalley, Bandelier (_Peabody Mus. Reports_, ii. 398) and his references.\r\n\r\n[837] Prescott, i., introduction ch. 6, tells the story of their golden\r\nage.\r\n\r\n[838] Cf. the map in Lucien Biart’s _Les Aztèques_ (Paris, 1885).\r\nPrescott says the maps in Clavigero, Lopez, and Robertson defy “equally\r\ntopography and history.” Cf. note on plans of the city and valley\r\nin Vol. II. pp. 364, 369, 374, to which may be added, as showing\r\ndiversified views, those in Stevens’s _Herrera_ (London, 1740), vol.\r\nii.; Bordone’s _Libro_ (1528); Icazbalceta’s _Coll. de docs._, i. 390;\r\nand the Eng. translation of Cortes’ despatches, 333.\r\n\r\n[839] This is placed A.D. 1325. Cf. references in Bancroft (v. 346).\r\n\r\n[840] On the conquest of the Tecpanecas by the Mexicans, see the\r\nreferences in Bandelier (_Peabody Mus. Reports_, ii. 412).\r\n\r\n[841] For details of the period of the Chichimec ascendency, see\r\nBancroft (v. ch. 5-7), Brasseur (_Nat. Civil._ ii.), and the\r\nauthorities plentifully cited in Bancroft.\r\n\r\n[842] On the nature of the Mexican confederacy see Bandelier (_Peabody\r\nMus. Reports_, ii. 416). He enumerates the authorities upon the\r\npoint that no one of the allied tribes exercised any powers over the\r\nothers beyond the exclusive military direction of the Mexicans proper\r\n(_Peabody Mus. Reports_, ii. 559). Orozco y Berra (_Geografía_, etc.)\r\nclaims that there was a tendency to assimilate the conquered people\r\nto the Mexican conditions. Bandelier claims that “no attempt, either\r\ndirect or implied, was made to assimilate or incorporate them.” He\r\nurges that nowhere on the march to Mexico did Cortés fall in with\r\nMexican rulers of subjected tribes. It does not seem to be clear in all\r\ncases whether it was before or after the confederation was formed, or\r\nwhether it was by the Mexicans or Tezcucans that Tecpaneca, Xochimilca,\r\nCuitlahuac, Chalco, Acolhuacan, and Quauhnahuac, were conquered. Cf.\r\nBandelier in _Peabody Mus. Reports_, ii. 691. As to the tributaries,\r\nsee _Ibid._ 695.\r\n\r\n[843] Cf. Brasseur’s _Nations Civ._ ii. 457, on Tezcuco in its palmy\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n[844] Sometimes written Mochtheuzema, Moktezema. The Aztec Montezuma\r\nmust not, as is contended, be confounded with the hero-god of the\r\nNew Mexicans. Cf. Bancroft, iii. 77, 171; Brinton’s _Myths_, 190;\r\nSchoolcraft’s _Ind. Tribes_, iv. 73; Tylor’s _Prim. Culture_, ii. 384;\r\nShort, 333.\r\n\r\n[845] This has induced some historians to call these wars “holy wars.”\r\nBandelier discredits wholly the common view, that wars were undertaken\r\nto secure victims for the sacrificial stone (_Archæol. Tour_, 24). But\r\nin another place (_Peabody Mus. Reports_, ii. 128) he says: “War was\r\nrequired for the purpose of obtaining human victims, their religion\r\ndemanding human sacrifices at least eighteen times every year.”\r\n\r\n[846] As to these carvings, which have not yet wholly disappeared, see\r\n_Peabody Mus. Reports_, ii. 677, 678. There is a series of alleged\r\nportraits of the Mexican kings in Carbajal-Espinosa’s _Hist. de Mexico_\r\n(Mexico, 1862). See pictures of Montezuma II. in Vol. II. 361, 363, and\r\nthat in Ranking, p. 313.\r\n\r\n[847] Bancroft (v. 466) enumerates the great variety of such proofs of\r\ndisaster, and gives references (p. 469). Cf. Prescott, i. p. 309.\r\n\r\n[848] Tezozomoc (cap. 106) gives the description of the first bringing\r\nof the news to Montezuma of the arrival of the Spaniards on the coast.\r\n\r\n[849] Brinton’s _Amer. Hero Myths_, 139, etc. See, on the prevalence\r\nof the idea of the return at some time of the hero-god, Brinton’s\r\n_Myths of the New World_, p. 160. “We must remember,” he says, “that\r\na fiction built on an idea is infinitely more tenacious of life than\r\na story founded on fact.” Brinton (_Myths_, 188) gathers from Gomara,\r\nCogolludo, Villagutierre, and others, instances to show how prevalent\r\nin America was the presentiment of the arrival and domination of a\r\nwhite race,—a belief still prevailing among their descendants of\r\nthe middle regions of America who watch for the coming of Montezuma\r\n(_Ibid._ p. 190). Brinton does not seem to recognize the view held by\r\nmany that the Montezuma of the Aztecs was quite a different being from\r\nthe demi-god of the Pueblas of New Mexico.\r\n\r\n[850] It is not easy to reconcile the conflicting statements of the\r\nnative historians respecting the course of events during the Aztec\r\nsupremacy, such is the mutual jealousy of the Mexican and Tezcucan\r\nwriters. Brasseur has satisfied himself of the authenticity of a\r\ncertain sequence and character of events (_Nations Civilisées_), and\r\nBancroft simply follows him (v. 401). Veytia is occupied more with\r\nthe Tezcucans than with the Aztecs. The condensed sketch here given\r\nfollows the main lines of the collated records. We find good pictures\r\nof the later history of Mexico and Tlascala, before the Spaniards came,\r\nin Prescott (i. book 2d, ch. vi., and book 3d, ch. ii.). Bancroft\r\n(v. ch. 10) with his narrative and references helps us out with the\r\nsomewhat monotonous details of all the districts of Mexico which were\r\noutside the dominance of the Mexican valley, as of Cholula, Tlascala,\r\nMichoacan, and Oajaca, with the Miztecs and Zapotecs, inhabiting this\r\nlast province.\r\n\r\n[851] Bancroft (v. 543-553).\r\n\r\n[852] It is so held by Stephens, Waldeck, Mayer, Prichard,\r\nTernaux-Compans, not to name others.\r\n\r\n[853] Vol. v. 617.\r\n\r\n[854] The Maya calendar and astronomical system, as the basis of the\r\nMaya chronology, is explained in the version which Perez gave into\r\nSpanish of a Maya manuscript (translated into English by Stephens\r\nin his _Yucatan_), and which Valentini has used in his “Katunes of\r\nMaya History,” in the _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, Oct. 1879. On the\r\ndifficulties of the subject see Brasseur’s _Nations Civilisées_ (ii.\r\nch. 1). Cf. also his _Landa_, section xxxix., and page 366, from the\r\n“Cronologia antigua de Yucatan.” Cf. further, Cyrus Thomas’s _MS.\r\nTroano_, ch. 2, and Powell’s _Third Report Bur. of Ethn._, pp. xxx\r\nand 3; Ancona’s _Yucatan_, ch. xi.; Bancroft’s _Nat.

Cf. Prescott’s _Mexico_, i. 50; Bancroft\r\n(_Nat. Races_, ii. ch. 14) epitomizes the information on the laws\r\nand courts of the Nahua; Bandelier (_Peabody Mus. Repts._, ii. 446),\r\nreferring to Zurita’s Report, which he characterizes as marked for\r\nperspicacity, deep knowledge, and honest judgment, speaks of it as\r\nembodying the experience of nearly twenty years,—eleven of which were\r\npassed in Mexico,—and in which the author gave answers to inquiries put\r\nby the king. “If we could obtain,” says Bandelier, “all the answers\r\ngiven to these questions from all parts of Spanish America, and all as\r\nelaborate and truthful as those of Zurita, Palacio, and Ondegardo, our\r\nknowledge of the aboriginal history and ethnology of Spanish America\r\nwould be much advanced.” Zurita’s Report in a French translation is\r\nin Ternaux-Compans’ _Collection_; the original is in Pacheco’s _Docs.\r\ninéditos_, but in a mutilated text.\r\n\r\n[864] See Vol. II. p. 346.\r\n\r\n[865] It is much we owe to the twelve Franciscan friars who on\r\nMay 13, 1524, landed in Mexico to convert and defend the natives.\r\nIt is from their writings that we must draw a large part of our\r\nknowledge respecting the Indian character, condition, and history.\r\nThese Christian apostles were Martin de Valencia, Francisco de Soto,\r\nMartin de Coruña, Juan Xuares, Antonio de Ciudad Rodrigo, Toribio de\r\nBenavente, Garcia de Cisneros, Luis de Fuensalida, Juan de Ribas,\r\nFrancisco Ximenez, Andrés de Cordoba, Juan de Palos.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Historia_ of Las Casas, particularly from that part of it\r\ncalled _Apologética historia_, we can also derive some help.

Icazbalceta (_Bib. Mex. del Siglo xvi._, i. p.\r\n33) gives a long account of Gante. There is a French version of the\r\nletter in Ternaux’s _Collection_.\r\n\r\n[874] See Vol. II. p. 397. Cf.

Chavero’s _Sahagún_ (Mexico, 1877).\r\n\r\n[878] A few data can be added to the account of Sahagún given in\r\nVol. II. p. 415. J. F. Ramirez completes the bibliography of Sahagún\r\nin the _Boletin de la Real Academia de la Historia de Madrid_, vi.\r\n85 (1885). Icazbalceta, having told the story of Sahagún’s life in\r\nhis edition of Mendieta’s _Hist. Eclesiastica Indiana_ (México,\r\n1870), has given an extended critical and bibliographical account in\r\nhis _Bibliografía Mexicana_ (México, 1886), vol. i. 247-308. Other\r\nbibliographical detail can be gleaned from Pilling’s _Proof-sheets_,\r\np. 677, etc.; Icazbalceta’s _Apuntes_; Beristain’s _Biblioteca_;\r\nthe _Bibliotheca Mexicana_ of Ramirez. The list in Adolfo Llanos’s\r\n_Sahagún y su historia de México_ (_Museo Nac. de Méx. Anales_, iii.,\r\npt. 3, p. 71) is based chiefly on Alfredo Chavero’s _Sahagún_ (México,\r\n1877). Brasseur de Bourbourg, in his _Palenqué_ (ch. 5), has explained\r\nthe importance of what Brevoort calls Sahagún’s “great encyclopædia\r\nof the Mexican Empire.” Rosny (_Les documents écrits de l’Antiquité\r\nAméricaine_, p. 69) speaks of seeing a copy of the _Historia_ in\r\nMadrid, accompanied by remarkable Aztec pictures. Bancroft, referring\r\nto the defective texts of Sahagún in Kingsborough and Bustamante, says:\r\n“Fortunately what is missing in one I have always found in the other.”\r\nHe further speaks of the work of Sahagún as “the most complete and\r\ncomprehensive, so far as aboriginal history is concerned, furnishing\r\nan immense mass of material, drawn from native sources, very badly\r\narranged and written.” Eleven books of Sahagún are given to the social\r\ninstitutions of the natives, and but one to the conquest. Jourdanet’s\r\nedition is mentioned elsewhere (Vol. II.).\r\n\r\n[879] See Vol. II. p. 421.\r\n\r\n[880] Those who used him most, like Clavigero and Brasseur de\r\nBourbourg, complain of this. Torquemada, says Bandelier (_Peabody Mus.\r\nRepts._ ii. 119), “notwithstanding his unquestionable credulity, is\r\nextremely important on all questions of Mexican antiquities.”\r\n\r\n[881] _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, n. s., i. 105.\r\n\r\n[882] Cf. Vol. II. 417; Prescott, i. 13, 163, 193, 196; Bancroft,\r\n_Nat. Races_, v. 147; Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_, i. 325. It must be\r\nconfessed that with no more authority than the old Mexican paintings,\r\ninterpreted through the understanding of old men and their traditions,\r\nIxtlilxochitl has not the firmest ground to walk on. Aubin thinks that\r\nIxtlilxochitl’s confusion and contradictions arise from his want of\r\npatience in studying his documents; and some part of it may doubtless\r\nhave arisen from his habit, as Brasseur says (_Annales de Philosophie\r\nChrétienne_, May, 1855, p. 329), of altering his authorities to\r\nmagnify the glories of his genealogic line. Max Müller (_Chips from\r\na German Workshop_, i. 322) says of his works: “Though we must not\r\nexpect to find in them what we are accustomed to call history, they\r\nare nevertheless of great historical interest, as supplying the vague\r\noutlines of a distant past, filled with migrations, wars, dynasties\r\nand revolutions, such as were cherished in the memory of the Greeks in\r\nthe time of Solon.” In addition to his _Historia Chichimeca_ and his\r\n_Relaciones_, (both of which are given by Kingsborough, while Ternaux\r\nhas translated portions,)—the MS. of the _Relaciones_ being in the\r\nMexican archives,—Ixtlilxochitl left a large mass of his manuscript\r\nstudies of the antiquities, often repetitionary in substance. Some are\r\nfound in the compilation made in Mexico by Figueroa in 1792, by order\r\nof the Spanish government (Prescott, i. 193). Some were in the Ramirez\r\ncollection. Quaritch (_MS. Collections_, Jan., 1888, no. 136) held\r\none from that collection, dated about 1680, at £16, called _Sumaria\r\nRelacion_, which concerned the ancient Chichimecs. Those which are best\r\nknown are a _Historia de la Nueva España_, or _Historia del Reyno de\r\nTezcuco_, and a _Historia de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe_, if this last\r\nis by him.\r\n\r\n[883] _Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne_, May, 1855, p. 326.\r\n\r\n[884] In his _Quatre Lettres_, p. 24, he calls it the sacred book of\r\nthe Toltecs. “C’est le Livre divin lui-même, c’est le Teoamoxtli.”\r\n\r\n[885] Brasseur’s _Lettres à M. le due de Valmy, Lettre seconde_.\r\n\r\n[886] _Catálogo_, pp. 17, 18.\r\n\r\n[887] Brasseur, _Bibl.

Cf. Bancroft, iii. 57, 63, and in vol. v., where he\r\nendeavors to patch together Brasseur’s fragments of it. Short, p. 241.\r\n\r\n[889] Humboldt says that Sigüenza inherited Ixtlilxochitl’s collection;\r\nand that it was preserved in the College of San Pedro till 1759.\r\n\r\n[890] _Giro del mondo_, 1699, vol. vi. Cf. Kingsborough, vol. iv.\r\nRobertson attacked Carreri’s character for honesty, and claimed it\r\nwas a received opinion that he had never been out of Italy. Clavigero\r\ndefended Carreri. Humboldt thinks Carreri’s local coloring shows he\r\nmust have been in Mexico.\r\n\r\n[891] Cf. the bibliog., in Vol. II., p. 425, of his _Storia Antica del\r\nMessico_.\r\n\r\n[892] We owe to him descriptions at this time of the collections of\r\nMendoza, of that in the Vatican, and of that at Vienna. Robertson made\r\nan enumeration of such manuscripts; but his knowledge was defective,\r\nand he did not know even of those at Oxford.\r\n\r\n[893] Robertson was inclined to disparage Clavigero’s work, asserting\r\nthat he could find little in him beyond what he took from Acosta and\r\nHerrera “except the improbable narratives and fanciful conjectures\r\nof Torquemada and Boturini.” Clavigero criticised Robertson, and the\r\nEnglish historian in his later editions replied. Prescott points\r\nout (i. 70) that Clavigero only knew Sahagún through the medium\r\nof Torquemada and later writers. Bancroft (_Nat. Races_, v. 149;\r\n_Mexico_, i. 700) thinks that Clavigero “owes his reputation much more\r\nto his systematic arrangement and clear narration of traditions that\r\nhad before been greatly confused, and to the omission of the most\r\nperplexing and contradictory points, than to deep research or new\r\ndiscoveries.”\r\n\r\n[894] See Vol. II. p. 418. Brasseur de Bourbourg’s _Hist. des Nations\r\nCivilisées_, p. xxxii. Clavigero had described it.\r\n\r\n[895] He had collected nearly 500 Mexican paintings in all. Aubin\r\n(_Notices_, etc., p. 21) says that Boturini nearly exhausted the field\r\nin his searches, and with the collection of Sigüenza he secured all\r\nthose cited by Ixtlilxochitl and the most of those concealed by the\r\nIndians,—of which mention is made by Torquemada, Sahagún, Valadés,\r\nZurita, and others; and that the researches of Bustamante, Cubas,\r\nGondra, and others, up to 1851, had not been able to add much of\r\nimportance to what Boturini possessed.\r\n\r\n[896] This portion of his collection has not been traced. The fact is\r\nindeed denied.\r\n\r\n[897] _Idea de una nueva historia general de la America septentrional_\r\n(Madrid, 1746); Carter-Brown, iii. 817; Brasseur’s _Bibl.

Mex.-Guat._, p. 68.\r\n\r\n[901] Prescott, i. 133. Gama and others collected another class\r\nof hieroglyphics, of less importance, but still interesting as\r\nillustrating legal and administrative processes used in later times,\r\nin the relations of the Spaniards with the natives; and still others\r\nembracing Christian prayers, catechisms, etc., employed by the\r\nmissionaries in the religious instruction (Aubin, _Notice_, etc., 21).\r\nHumboldt (vol. xiii., pl. p. 141) gives “a lawsuit in hieroglyphics.”\r\n\r\nThere was published (100 copies) at Madrid, in 1878, _Pintura del\r\nGobernador, Alcaldes y Regidores de México, Codice en geroglíficos\r\nMéxicanos y en lengua Castellana y Azteca, Existente en la Biblioteca\r\ndel Excmo Señor Duque de Osuna_,—a legal record of the later Spanish\r\ncourts affecting the natives.\r\n\r\n[902] Humboldt describes these collections which he knew at the\r\nbeginning of the century, speaking of José Antonio Pichardo’s as the\r\nfinest.\r\n\r\n[903] _Notice sur une collection d’antiquités Mexicaines, being an\r\nextract from a Mémoire sur la peinture didactique et l’Écriture\r\nfigurative des Anciens Mexicains_ (Paris, 1851; again, 1859-1861). Cf.\r\npapers in _Revue Américaine et Orientale_, 1st ser., iii., iv., and v.\r\nAubin says that Humboldt found that part of the Boturini collection\r\nwhich had been given over to the Mexican archivists diminished by seven\r\neighths. He also shows how Ternaux-Compans (_Crauatés Horribles_,\r\np. 275-289), Rafael Isidro Gondra (in Veytia, _Hist. Ant. de Mex._,\r\n1836, i. 49), and Bustamante have related the long contentions over\r\nthe disposition of these relics, and how the Academy of History at\r\nMadrid had even secured the suppression of a similar academy among\r\nthe antiquaries in Mexico, which had been formed to develop the study\r\nof their antiquities. It was as a sort of peace-offering that the\r\nSpanish king now caused Veytia to be empowered to proceed with the\r\nwork which Boturini had begun. This allayed the irritation for a\r\nwhile, but on Veytia’s death (1769) it broke out again, when Gama was\r\ngiven possession of the collection, which he further increased. It was\r\nat Gama’s death sold at auction, when Humboldt bought the specimens\r\nwhich are now in Berlin, and Waldeck secured others which he took to\r\nEurope. It was from Waldeck that Aubin acquired the Boturini part of\r\nhis collection. The rest of the collection remained in Mexico, and in\r\nthe main makes a part at present of the Museo Nacional. But Aubin is a\r\ndoubtful witness.\r\n\r\nAubin says that he now proposed to refashion the Boturini collection\r\nby copies where he could not procure the originals; to add others,\r\nembracing whatever he could still find in the hands of the native\r\npopulation, and what had been collected by Veytia, Gama, and Pichardo.\r\nIn 1851, when he wrote, Aubin had given twenty years to this task, and\r\nwith what results the list of his MSS., which he appends to the account\r\nwe have quoted, will show.\r\n\r\nThese include in the native tongue:—\r\n\r\n_a._ History of Mexico from A.D. 1064 to 1521, in fragments, from\r\nTezozomoc and from Alonso Franco, annotated by Domingo Chimalpain (a\r\ncopy).\r\n\r\n_b._ Annals of Mexico, written apparently in 1528 by one who had taken\r\npart in the defence of Mexico (an original).\r\n\r\n_c._ Several historical narratives on European paper, by Domingo\r\nChimalpain, coming down to A.D. 1591, which have in great part been\r\ntranslated by Aubin, who considers them the most important documents\r\nwhich we possess.\r\n\r\n_d._ A history of Colhuacan and Mexico, lacking the first leaf. This is\r\ndescribed as being in the handwriting of Ixtlilxochitl, and Aubin gives\r\nthe dates of its composition as 1563 and 1570. It is what has later\r\nbeen known as the _Codex Chimalpopoca_.\r\n\r\n_e._ Zapata’s history of Tlaxcalla.\r\n\r\n_f._ A copy by Loaysa of an original, from which Torquemada has copied\r\nseveral chapters.\r\n\r\n[904] The chief of the Boturini acquisition he enumerates as follows:—\r\n\r\n_a._ Toltec annals on fifty leaves of European paper, cited by Gama in\r\nhis _Descripcion histórica_. Cf. Brasseur, _Nations Civilisées_, p.\r\nlxxvi.\r\n\r\n_b._ Chichimec annals, on Indian paper, six leaves, of which ten pages\r\nconsist of pictures, the original so-called _Codex Chimalpopoca_,\r\nof which Gama made a copy, also in the Aubin collection, as well as\r\nIxtlilxochitl’s explanation of it. Aubin says that he has used this\r\naccount of Ixtlilxochitl to rectify that historian’s blunders.\r\n\r\n_c._ Codex on Indian paper, having a picture of the Emperor Xolotl.\r\n\r\n_d._ A painting on prepared skin, giving the genealogy of the\r\nChichimecan chiefs, accompanied by the copies made by Pichardo and\r\nBoturini. Cf. _Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France_, 2d ser., i. 283.\r\n\r\n_e._ A synchronical history of Tepechpan and of Mexico, on Indian\r\npaper, accompanied by a copy made by Pichardo and an outline sketch of\r\nthat in the Museo Nacional.\r\n\r\nWithout specifying others which Aubin enumerates, he gives as other\r\nacquisitions the following in particular:—\r\n\r\n_a._ Pichardo’s copy of a Codex Mexicanus, giving the history of the\r\nMexicans from their leaving Aztlan to 1590.\r\n\r\n_b._ An original Mexican history from the departure from Aztlan to 1569.\r\n\r\n_c._ Fragments which had belonged to Sigüenza.\r\n\r\n[905] _Notice sur une Collection, etc._, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[906] _Hist. des Nations Civilisées_ (i. pp. xxxi, lxxvi, etc.; cf.\r\nMüller’s _Chips_, i. 317, 320, 323). Brasseur in the same place\r\ndescribes his own collection; and it may be further followed in his\r\n_Bibl. Mex.-Guat._, and in the _Pinart Catalogue_. Dr. Brinton says\r\nthat we owe much for the preservation during late years of Maya MSS. to\r\nDon Juan Pio Perez, and that the best existing collection of them is\r\nthat of Canon Crescencio Carrillo y Ancona. José F. Ramirez (see Vol.\r\nII. p. 398) is another recent Mexican collector, and his MSS. have been\r\nin one place and another in the market of late years. Quaritch’s recent\r\ncatalogues reveal a number of them, including his own MS. _Catálogo de\r\nColecciones_ (Jan., 1888, no. 171), and some of his unpublished notes\r\non Prescott, not included in those “notas y ecclarecimientos” appended\r\nto Navarro’s translation of the _Conquest of Mexico_ (_Catal._, 1885,\r\nno. 28,502). The several publications of Léon de Rosny point us to\r\nscattered specimens. In his _Doc. écrits de l’Antiquité Amér._ he gives\r\nthe fac-simile of a colored Aztec map. A MS. in the collection of the\r\nCorps Legislatif, in Paris, and that of the Codex Indiæ Meridionalis\r\nare figured in his _Essai sur le déchiffrement, etc._ (pl. ix, x). In\r\nthe _Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France, n. s._, vol. i., etc., we\r\nfind plates of the Mappe Tlotzin, and a paper of Madier de Montjau,\r\n“sur quelques manuscrits figuratifs de l’Ancien Méxique.” Cf. also\r\n_Anales del Museo_, viii.\r\n\r\nCf. for further mention of collections the _Revue Orientale et\r\nAméricaine_; Cyrus Thomas in the _Am. Antiquarian_, May, 1884 (vol.\r\nvi.); and the more comprehensive enumeration in the introduction\r\nto Domenech’s _Manuscrit pictographique_. Orozco y Berra, in the\r\nintroduction to his _Geografia de las Lenguas y Carta Etnográfica_\r\n(Mexico, 1864), speaks of the assistance he obtained from the\r\ncollections of Ramirez and of Icazbalceta.\r\n\r\n[907] See Vol. II. p. 418.\r\n\r\n[908] See Vol. II. p. 418.

The\r\nvolume contains the “Books of Chilan Balam,” written “not later than\r\n1595,” and also the “Chac Xulub Chen,” written by a Maya chief, Nakuk\r\nPech, in 1562, to recount the story of the Spanish conquest of Yucatan.\r\n\r\n[917] This was in 1843, when Stephens made his English translation from\r\nPio Perez’s Spanish version, _Antigua Chronologia Yucateca_; and from\r\nStephens’s text, Brasseur gave it a French rendering in his edition\r\nof Landa. (Cf. also his _Nat. Civilisées_, ii. p. 2.) Perez, who in\r\nStephens’s opinion (_Yucatan_, ii. 117) was the best Maya scholar in\r\nthat country, made notes, which Valentini published in his “Katunes\r\nof Maya History,” in the _Pro. of the Amer. Antiq. Soc._, Oct., 1879\r\n(Worcester, 1880), but they had earlier been printed in Carrillo’s\r\n_Hist. y Geog. de Yucatan_ (Merida, 1881). Bancroft (_Nat. Races_, v.\r\n624) reprints Stephens’s text with notes from Brasseur.\r\n\r\nThe books of Chilan Balam were used both by Cogolludo and Lizana; and\r\nBrasseur printed some of them in the _Mission Scientifique au Méxique_.\r\nThey are described in Carrillo’s _Disertacion sobre la historia de\r\nlengua Maya ó Yucateca_ (Merida, 1870).\r\n\r\n[918] Brasseur, _Bib. Mex.-Guat._, p. 30. See Vol. II. p. 429. The\r\nSpanish title is _Relacion de las Cosas de Yucatan_.\r\n\r\n[919] From the _Proc. of the Amer. Philos. Soc._, xxiv.\r\n\r\n[920] Cf. Bandelier in _Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, n. s., vol. i. p. 88.\r\n\r\n[921] The second edition was called _Los tres Siglos de la Dominacion\r\nEspañola en Yucatan_ (Campeche and Merida, 2 vols., 1842, 1845). It was\r\nedited unsatisfactorily by Justo Sierra. Cf. Vol. II. p. 429; Brasseur,\r\n_Bib. Mex.-Guat._, p. 47.\r\n\r\nThis, like Juan de Villagutierre Soto-Mayor’s _Historia de la\r\nConquista de la Provincia de el Itza, reduccion, y progressos de la\r\nde el Lacandon, y otras naciones de Indios Barbaros, de la mediacion\r\nde el Reyno de Gautimala, a las Provincias de Yucatan, en la America\r\nSeptentrional_ (Madrid, 1701), (which, says Bandelier, is of importance\r\nfor that part of Yucatan which has remained unexplored), has mostly\r\nto do with the Indians under the Spanish rule, but the books are not\r\ndevoid of usefulness in the study of the early tribes.\r\n\r\nOf the modern comments on the Yucatan ancient history, those of\r\nBrasseur in his _Nations Civilisées_ are more to be trusted than his\r\nintroduction to his edition of Landa, which needs to be taken with\r\ndue recognition of his later vagaries; and Brinton has studied their\r\nhistory at some length in the introduction to his _Maya Chronicles_.\r\nThe first volume of Eligio Ancona’s _Hist. de Yucatan_ covers the\r\nearly period. See Vol. II. p. 429. Brinton calls it “disappointingly\r\nsuperficial.” There is much that is popularly retrospective in the\r\nvarious and not always stable contributions of Dr. Le Plongeon and\r\nhis wife. The last of Mrs. Le Plongeon’s papers is one on “The Mayas,\r\ntheir customs, laws, religion,” in the _Mag. Amer. Hist._, Aug., 1887.\r\nBancroft’s second volume groups the necessary references to every phase\r\nof Maya history. Cf. Charnay, English translation, ch. 15; and Geronimo\r\nCastillo’s _Diccionario Histórico, biográfico y monumental de Yucatan_\r\n(Mérida, 1866). Of Crescencio Carrillo and his _Historia Antigua de\r\nYucatan_ (Mérida, 1881), Brinton says: “I know of no other Yucatecan\r\nwho has equal enthusiasm or so just an estimate of the antiquarian\r\nriches of his native land” (_Amer. Hero Myths_, 147). Bastian\r\nsummarizes the history of Yucatan and Guatemala in the second volume of\r\nhis _Culturländer des alten Amerika_.\r\n\r\n[922] _Yucatan_, ii. 79.\r\n\r\n[923] See C. H. Berendt on the hist. docs. of Guatemala in _Smithsonian\r\nReport_, 1876. There is a partial bibliography of Guatemala in W.\r\nT. Brigham’s _Guatemala the land of the Quetzal_ (N. Y., 1887), and\r\nanother by Bandelier in the _Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, n. s., vol. i. p.\r\n101. The references in Brasseur’s _Hist. Nations Civilisées_, and in\r\nBancroft’s _Native Races_, vol. v., will be a ready means for collating\r\nthe early sources.\r\n\r\n[924] Scherzer and Brasseur are somewhat at variance here.\r\n\r\n[925] “There are some coincidences between the Old Testament and the\r\nQuiché MS. which are certainly startling.” Müller’s _Chips_, i. 328.\r\n\r\n[926] _Wanderungen durch die mittel-Amerikanischen Freistaaten_\r\n(Braunschweig, 1857—an English translation, London, 1857).\r\n\r\n[927] Leclerc, no. 1305.\r\n\r\n[928] H. H. Bancroft, _Nat.

Helps, _Spanish Conquest_,\r\niv. App., gives a brief synopsis,—the first one done in English.\r\n\r\n[929] Max Müller dissents from this. _Chips_, i. 326. Müller reminds\r\nus, if we are suspicious of the disjointed manner of what has come\r\ndown to us as the _Popul Vuh_, that “consecutive history is altogether\r\na modern idea, of which few only of the ancient nations had any\r\nconception. If we had the exact words of the _Popul Vuh_, we should\r\nprobably find no more history there than we find in the Quiché MS. as\r\nit now stands.”\r\n\r\n[930] Cf. _Aborig. Amer. Authors_, p. 33.\r\n\r\n[931] _The names of the gods in the Kiché Myths of Central America_\r\n(Philad., 1881), from the _Proc. Amer. Philos.

Eleventh Report_, p. 391, he says of it that “it appears to be for\r\nthe first chapters an evident fabrication, or at least accommodation\r\nof Indian mythology to Christian notions,—a pious fraud; but the bulk\r\nis an equally evident collection of original traditions of the Indians\r\nof Guatemala, and as such the most valuable work for the aboriginal\r\nhistory and ethnology of Central America.”\r\n\r\n[933] _Hist.

Cf. Bollaert, in the\r\n_Royal Soc. of Lit. Trans._, 1863. Brasseur (_Bib. Mex.-Guat._, p. 45;\r\nPinart, no. 231) also speaks of another Quiché document, of which his\r\nMS. copy is entitled _Titulo de los Señores de Totonicapan, escrito\r\nen lengua Quiché, el año de 1554, y traducido al Castellano el año de\r\n1834, por el Padre Dionisio José Chonay, indígena_, which tells the\r\nstory of the Quiché race somewhat differently from the _Popul Vuh_.\r\n\r\n[934] See Vol. II. p. 419.\r\n\r\n[935] It stands in Brasseur’s _Bib. Mex.-Guat._, p. 13, as _Memorial\r\nde Tecpan-Atitlan_ (_Solola_), _histoire des deux familles royales\r\ndu royaume des Cakchiquels d’Iximché ou Guatémala, rédigé en langue\r\nCakchiquèle par le prince Don Francisco Ernantez Arana-Xahila, des rois\r\nAhpozotziles_, where Brasseur speaks of it as analogous to the _Popul\r\nVuh_, but with numerous and remarkable variations. The MS. remained in\r\nthe keeping of Xahila till 1562, when Francisco Gebuta Queh received it\r\nand continued it (_Pinart Catalogue_, no. 35).\r\n\r\n[936] See Vol. II. 419; Bancroft, _Nat. Races_, v. 564; Bandelier in\r\n_Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, i. 105. Bandelier (_Peabody Mus. Repts._, ii.\r\n391) says that it is now acknowledged that the _Recordacion florida_ of\r\nFuentes y Guzman is “full of exaggerations and misstatements.” Brasseur\r\n(_Bib. Mex.-Guat._, pp. 65, 87), in speaking of Fuentes’ _Noticia\r\nhistórica de los indios de Guatemala_ (of which manuscript he had a\r\ncopy), says that he had access to a great number of native documents,\r\nbut profited little by them, either because he could not read them, or\r\nhis translators deceived him. Brasseur adds that Fuentes’ account of\r\nthe Quiché rulers is “un mauvais roman qui n’a pas le sens commun.”\r\nThis last is a manuscript used by Domingo Juarros in his _Compendio de\r\nla historia de la ciudad de Guatemala_ (Guatemala, 1808-1818, in two\r\nvols.—become rare), but reprinted in the _Museo Guatemalteco_, 1857.\r\nThe English translation, by John Baily, a merchant living in Guatemala,\r\nwas published as a _Statistical and Commercial History of Guatemala_\r\n(Lond., 1823). Cf. Vol. II. p. 419. Francisco Vazquez depended largely\r\non native writers in his _Crónica de la Provincia de Guatemala_\r\n(Guatemala, 1714-16). (See Vol. II. p. 419.)\r\n\r\n[937] See note in Bancroft, iii. 451.\r\n\r\n[938] Vol. II. 419. Helps (iii. 300), speaking of Remesal, says: “He\r\nhad access to the archives of Guatemala early in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, and he is one of those excellent writers so dear to the\r\nstudents of history, who is not prone to declamation, or rhetoric,\r\nor picturesque writing, but indulges us largely by the introduction\r\neverywhere of most important historical documents, copied boldly into\r\nthe text.”\r\n\r\n[939] Vol. II. 419.\r\n\r\n[940] Vol. II. 417.\r\n\r\n[941] E. G. Squier printed in 1860 (see Vol. II. p. vii.) Diego Garcia\r\nde Palacio’s _Carta dirigida al Rey de España, año 1576_, under the\r\nEnglish title of _Description of the ancient Provinces of Guazacupan,\r\nIzalco, Cuscatlan, and Chiquimula in Guatemala_, which is also included\r\nin Pacheco’s _Coleccion_, vol. vi. Bandelier refers to Estevan Aviles’\r\n_Historia de Guatemala desde los tiempos de los Indios_ (Guatemala,\r\n1663). A good reputation belongs to a modern work, Francisco de Paula\r\nGarcia Pelaez’s _Memorias para la Historia del antiguo reyno de\r\nGuatemala_ (Guatemala, 1851-53, in three vols.).\r\n\r\n[942] For details follow the references in Brasseur’s _Nat. Civil._;\r\nBancroft’s _Nat.

Bancroft summarized the history of these\r\nancient peoples in his vol. ii. ch. 2, and goes into detail in his vol.\r\nv.\r\n\r\n[944] He condenses the early Mexican history in his _Mexico_, i. ch.\r\n7. There are recent condensed narratives, in which avail has been had\r\nof the latest developments, in Baldwin’s _Ancient America_, ch. 4, and\r\nShort’s _North Americans of Antiquity_.\r\n\r\n[945] Mrs. Alice D. Le Plongeon has printed various summarized popular\r\npapers, like the “Conquest of the Mayas,” in the _Mag. Amer. Hist._,\r\nApril and June, 1888.\r\n\r\n[946] A list of Squier’s published writings was appended to the\r\n_Catalogue of Squier’s Library_, prepared by Joseph Sabin (N. Y.,\r\n1876), as sold at that time. By this it appears that his earliest study\r\nof these subjects was a review of Buxton’s _Migrations of the Ancient\r\nMexicans_, read before the London Ethnolog. Soc., and printed in 1848\r\nin the _Edinb. New Philosoph. Mag._, vol. xlvi. His first considerable\r\ncontribution was his _Travels in Cent. America, particularly in\r\nNicaragua, with a description of its aboriginal monuments_ (London\r\nand N. Y., 1852-53). He supplemented this by some popular papers in\r\n_Harper’s Mag._, 1854, 1855. (Cf. _Hist. Mag._, iv. 65; _Putnam’s\r\nMag._, xii. 549.) A year or two later he communicated papers on “Les\r\nIndiens Guatusos du Nicaragua,” and “Les indiens Xicaques du Honduras,”\r\nto the _Nouvelles Annales des Voyages_ (1856, 1858), and “A Visit to\r\nthe Guajiquero Indians” to _Harper’s Mag._, 1859. In 1860, Squier\r\nprojected the publication of a _Collection_ of documents, but only a\r\nletter (1576) of Palacio was printed (Icazbalceta, _Bibl. Mex._, i. p.\r\n326). He had intended to make the series more correct and with fewer\r\nomissions than Ternaux had allowed himself. His material, then the\r\nresult of ten years’ gathering, had been largely secured through the\r\ninstrumentality of Buckingham Smith. (See Vol. II. p. vii.)\r\n\r\n[947] “Art of war and mode of warfare of the Ancient Mexicans”\r\n(_Peabody Mus. Rept._, no. x.).\r\n\r\n“Distribution and tenure of lands, and the customs with respect to\r\ninheritance among the ancient Mexicans” (_Ibid._ no. xi.).\r\n\r\n“Special organizations and mode of government of the ancient Mexicans”\r\n(_Ibid._ no. xii.).\r\n\r\nThese papers reveal much thorough study of the earlier writers on the\r\ngeneral condition of the ancient people of Mexico, and the student\r\nfinds much help in their full references. It was this manifestation\r\nof his learning that led to his appointment by the Archæological\r\nInstitute,—the fruit of his labor in their behalf appearing in his\r\n_Report of an Archæological Tour in Mexico, 1881_, which constitutes\r\nthe second volume (1884) of the _Papers_ of that body. In his third\r\nsection he enlarges upon the condition of Mexico at the time of the\r\nConquest. His explorations covered the region from Tampico to Mexico\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n[948] _Library of Aboriginal American Literature_, (Philadelphia.)\r\n\r\n[949] James H. McCulloh, an officer of the U. S. army, published\r\n_Researches on America_ (Balt., 1816), expanded later into _Researches,\r\nphilosophical and antiquarian, concerning the original History of\r\nAmerica_ (Baltimore, 1829). His fifth and sixth parts concern the\r\n“Institutions of the Mexican Empire,” and “The nations inhabiting\r\nGuatemala” (Field, no. 987).\r\n\r\nG. F.

B. Tylor’s _Anahuac;\r\nor, Mexico and the Mexicans, ancient and modern_ (London, 1861), is\r\na readable rendering of the outlines of the ancient history, and he\r\ndescribes such of the archæological remains as fell in his way.\r\n\r\nH.

Alfred Chavero’s _México á través de los Siglos_.\r\n\r\n[964] Discrediting Gomara’s statement that De Ayllon found tribes near\r\nCape Hatteras who had tame deer and made cheese from their milk, Dr.\r\nBrinton says: “Throughout the continent there is not a single authentic\r\ninstance of a pastoral tribe, not one of an animal raised for its milk,\r\nnor for the transportation of persons, and very few for their flesh.\r\nIt was essentially a hunting race.” (_Myths of the New World_, 21.)\r\nHe adds: “The one mollifying element was agriculture, substituting a\r\nsedentary for a wandering life, supplying a fixed dependence for an\r\nuncertain contingency.”\r\n\r\n[965] See Vol. II. p. 98.\r\n\r\n[966] It was two years earlier, in 1517, that Hernandez de Cordova\r\nhad first noticed the ruins of the Yucatan coast, though Columbus, in\r\n1502, near Yucatan had met a Maya vessel, which with its navigators had\r\nastonished him.\r\n\r\n[967] “No writer,” says Bandelier (_Peabody Mus. Repts._ ii. 674), “has\r\nbeen more prolific in pictures of pomp, regal wealth and magnificence,\r\nthan Bernal Diaz. Most of the later writers have placed undue reliance\r\non his statements, assuming that the truthfulness of his own individual\r\nfeelings was the result of cool observation. Any one who has read\r\nattentively his _Mémoirs_ will become convinced that he is in fact one\r\nof the most unreliable eye-witnesses, so far as general principles are\r\nconcerned.... Cortes had personal and political motives to magnify and\r\nembellish the picture. If his statements fall far below those of his\r\ntroopers in thrilling and highly-colored details, there is every reason\r\nto believe that they are the more trustworthy.... In the descriptions\r\nby Cortes we find, on the whole, nothing but a barbarous display common\r\nto other Indian celebrations of a similar character.”\r\n\r\nBandelier’s further comment is (_Ibid._ ii. 397) “A feudal empire at\r\nTezcuco was an invention of the chroniclers, who had a direct interest,\r\nor thought to have one, in advancing the claims of the Tezcucan tribe\r\nto an original supremacy.”\r\n\r\nBandelier again (_Ibid._ ii. 385) points out the early statements\r\nof the conquerors, and of their annalists, which have prompted\r\nthe inference of a feudal condition of society; but he refers to\r\nIxtlilxochitl as “the chief originator of the feudal view;” and from\r\nhim Torquemada draws his inspiration. Wilson (_Prehist. Man_, i. 242)\r\nholds much the same views.\r\n\r\n[968] _Peabody Mus. Tenth Rept._ vol. ii. 114.\r\n\r\n[969] Bandelier (“Art of War, etc.,” in _Peabody Mus. Rept._ x.\r\n113) again says of De Pauw’s _Recherches philosophiques sur les\r\nAméricaines_, that it is “a very injudicious book, which by its\r\nextravagance and audacity created a great deal of harm. It permitted\r\nClavigero to attack even Robertson, because the latter had also applied\r\nsound criticism to the study of American aboriginal history, and by\r\nartfully placing both as upon the same platform, to counteract much of\r\nthe good effects of Robertson’s work.”\r\n\r\n[970] _Peabody Mus. Repts._ ii. 114.\r\n\r\n[971] In regard to the nature of the chief-of-men we find, among much\r\nelse of the first importance in the study of the Mexican government,\r\nan exposition in Sahagún (lib. vi. cap. 20), which seems to establish\r\nthe elective and non-hereditary character of the office. It was “this\r\noffice and its attributes,” says Bandelier (_Peabody Mus. Repts._ ii.\r\n670), “which have been the main stays of the notion that a high degree\r\nof civilization prevailed in aboriginal Mexico, in so far as its people\r\nwere ruled after the manner of eastern despotisms.” Bandelier (_Ibid._\r\nii. 133) says: “It is not impossible that the so-called empire of\r\nMexico may yet prove to have been but a confederacy of the Nahuatlac\r\ntribe of the valley, with the Mexicans as military leaders.” His\r\nargument on the word translated “king” is not convincing.\r\n\r\n[972] _Peabody Mus. Repts._ ii. 435.\r\n\r\n[973] Introd. to _Conquest of Mexico_. See Vol. II. p. 426. In the\r\nAppendix to his third volume, Prescott, relying mainly on the works of\r\nDupaix and Waldeck, arrived at conclusions as respects the origin of\r\nthe Mexican civilization, and its analogies with the Old World, which\r\naccord with those of Stephens, whose work had not appeared at the time\r\nwhen Prescott wrote.\r\n\r\n[974] _Houses and House Life_, p. 222.\r\n\r\n[975] Bancroft (ii. 92) says: “What is known of the Aztecs has\r\nfurnished material for nine tenths of all that has been written on the\r\nAmerican civilized nations in general.”\r\n\r\n[976] _Anahuac, or Mexico and the Mexicans, Ancient and Modern_\r\n(London, 1861). Tylor enlarges upon what he considers the evidences\r\nof immense populations; and respecting some of their arts he adds,\r\nfrom inspection of specimens of their handicraft, that “the Spanish\r\nconquerors were not romancing in the wonderful stories they told of the\r\nskill of the native goldsmiths.” On the other hand, Morgan (_Houses and\r\nHouse Life_, 223) thinks the figures of population grossly exaggerated.\r\n\r\n[977] Vol. II. p. 427.\r\n\r\n[978] When we consider that Rome, Constantinople, and Jerusalem, in\r\nspite of rapine, siege and fire, still retain numerous traces of\r\ntheir earliest times, and that not a vestige of the Aztec capital\r\nremains to us except its site, we must assume, in Wilson’s opinion\r\n(_Prehistoric Man_, i. 331), that its edifices and causeways must have\r\nbeen for the most part more slight and fragile than the descriptions\r\nof the conquerors implied. Morgan instances as a proof of the flimsy\r\ncharacter of their masonry, that Cortes in seventeen days levelled\r\nthree fourths of the city of Mexico. But, adds Wilson, “so far as\r\nan indigenous American civilization is concerned, no doubt can be\r\nentertained, and there is little room for questioning, that among races\r\nwho had carried civilization so far, there existed the capacity for its\r\nfurther development, independently of all borrowed aid” (p. 336). The\r\nBaron Nordenskjöld informs me that there is in the library at Upsala\r\na MS. map of Mexico by Santa Cruz (d. 1572) which contains numerous\r\nethnographical details, not to be found in printed maps of that day.\r\n\r\n[979] _Native Races_, ii. 159.\r\n\r\n[980] _Ibid._ ii. 133.\r\n\r\n[981] Bancroft has recently epitomized his views afresh in the _Amer.\r\nAntiquarian_, Jan., 1888.\r\n\r\n[982] Bancroft wrote in San Francisco, it will be remembered.\r\n\r\n[983] It was for Bandelier, in his “Social organization and mode of\r\ngovernment of the ancient Mexicans” (_Peabody Mus. Repts._ ii. 557),\r\nto demonstrate the proposition that tribal society based, according to\r\nMorgan, upon kin, and not political society, which rests upon territory\r\nand property, must be looked for among the ancient Mexicans.\r\n\r\n[984] Morgan’s _Houses_, etc., 225. Bandelier (_Peabody Mus.\r\nRept._, vol. ii. 114) speaks of the views advanced by Morgan in\r\nhis “Montezuma’s Dinner,” as “a bold stroke for the establishment\r\nof American ethnology on a new basis.” It must be remembered that\r\nBandelier was Morgan’s pupil.\r\n\r\n[985] _Ibid._ 222.\r\n\r\n[986] Morgan says of his predecessors, “they learned nothing and knew\r\nnothing” of Indian society.\r\n\r\n[987] _Ibid._ 223.\r\n\r\n[988] In this he of course assumes that the ruins in Spanish America\r\nare of communal edifices.\r\n\r\n[989] Bandelier’s papers are in the second volume of the _Reports of\r\nthe Peabody Museum_ at Cambridge. He contends in his “Art of Warfare\r\namong the Ancient Mexicans,” that he has shown the non-existence of\r\na military despotism, and proved their government to be “a military\r\ndemocracy, originally based upon communism in living.” A similar\r\nunderstanding pervades his other essay “On the social organization\r\nand mode of government of the ancient Mexicans.” Morgan and Bandelier\r\nprofess great admiration for each other,—Morgan citing his friend as\r\n“our most eminent scholar in Spanish American history” (_Houses_,\r\netc., 84), and Bandelier expresses his deep feeling of gratitude, etc.\r\n(_Archæolog. Tour_, 32). This affectionate relation has very likely\r\ndone something in unifying their intellectual sympathies. The _Ancient\r\nSociety, or researches in the lines of human progress from savagery\r\nthrough barbarism to civilization_ (N. Y. 1877), of Morgan is reflected\r\nvery palpably in these papers of Bandelier. The accounts of the war of\r\nthe conquest, as detailed in Bancroft’s _Mexico_ (vol. i.), and the\r\nviews of their war customs (_Native Races_, ii. ch. 13), contrasted\r\nwith Bandelier’s ideas,—who finds in Parkman’s books “the natural\r\nparallelism between the forays of the Iroquois and the so-called\r\nconquests of the Mexican confederacy” (_Archæol. Tour_, 32), and who\r\nreduces the battle of Otumba to an affair like that of Custer and\r\nthe Sioux (_Art of Warfare_),—give us in the military aspects of the\r\nancient life the opposed views of the two schools of interpreters.\r\n\r\n[990] Being vol. iv. of the _Contributions to No. Amer. Ethnol._ in\r\nPowell’s _Survey of the Rocky Mt. Region_. Some of Morgan’s cognate\r\nstudies relating to the aboriginal system of consanguinity and laws of\r\ndescent are in the _Smithsonian Contributions_, xvii., the _Smithsonian\r\nMisc. Coll._ ii., _Amer. Acad. Arts and Sci. Trans._ vii., and _Am.\r\nAssoc. Adv. Sci. Proc._, 1857.\r\n\r\n[991] Morgan in this, his last work, condenses in his first chapter\r\nthose which were numbered 1 to 4 in his _Ancient Society_, and in\r\nsucceeding sections he discusses the laws of hospitality, communism,\r\nusages of land and food, and the houses of the northern tribes, of\r\nthose of New Mexico, San Juan River, the moundbuilders, the Aztecs,\r\nand those in Yucatan and Central America. Among these he finds three\r\ndistinct ethnical stages, as shown in the northern Indian, higher in\r\nthe sedentary tribes of New Mexico, and highest among those of Mexico\r\nand Central America. S. F. Haven commemorated Morgan’s death in the\r\n_Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, Apr., 1880.\r\n\r\n[992] Cf. Bandelier on “the tenure of lands” in _Peabody Mus. Repts._\r\n(1878), no. xi., and Bancroft in _Nat. Races_, ii. ch. 6, p. 223.\r\n\r\n[993] Bandelier (_Peabody Mus. Repts._ ii. 391) points out that when\r\nMartin Ursúa captured Tayasál on Lake Petin, the last pueblo inhabited\r\nby Maya Indians, he found “all the inhabitants living brutally\r\ntogether, an entire relationship together in one single house,” and\r\nBandelier refers further to Morgan’s _Ancient Society_, Part 2, p. 181.\r\n\r\n[994] Bandelier (_Peabody Mus. Repts._ ii. 673) accepts the views of\r\nMorgan, calling it “a rude clannish feast,” given by the official\r\nhousehold of the tribe as a part of its daily duties and obligations.\r\n\r\n[995] On the character of the Tecpan (council house, or official house)\r\nof the Mexicans, which the early writers translate “palace,” with\r\nits sense of magnificence, see Bandelier (_Peabody Mus. Repts._ ii.\r\n406, 671, etc.), with his references. Morgan holds that Stephens is\r\nlargely responsible for the prevalence of erroneous notions regarding\r\nthe Mayas, by reason of using the words “palaces” and “great cities”\r\nfor defining what were really the pueblos of these southern Indians.\r\nBancroft (ii. 84), referring to the ruins, says: They have “the\r\nhighest value as confirming the truth of the reports made by Spanish\r\nwriters, very many, or perhaps most, of whose statements respecting the\r\nwonderful phenomena of the New World, without this incontrovertible\r\nmaterial proof, would find few believers among the skeptical students\r\nof the present day.” Bancroft had little prescience respecting what the\r\ncommunal theorists were going to say of these ruins.\r\n\r\n[996] Cf. Bancroft’s _Cent. America_, i. 317. Sir J. William Dawson, in\r\nhis _Fossil Men_ (p. 83), contends that Morgan has proved his point,\r\nand he calls the ruins of Spanish America “communistic barracks” (p.\r\n50). Higginson, in the first chapter of his _Larger History_, which is\r\na very excellent, condensed popular statement of the new views which\r\nMorgan inaugurated, says of him very truly, that he lacked moderation,\r\nand that there is “something almost exasperating in the positiveness\r\nwith which he sometimes assumes as proved that which is only probable.”\r\n\r\n[997] Bancroft in his foot-notes (vol. ii.) embodies the best\r\nbibliography of this ancient civilization. Cf. Wilson’s _Prehistoric\r\nMan_, i. ch. 14; C. Hermann Berendt’s “Centres of ancient civilization\r\nand their geographical distribution,” an _Address before the Amer.\r\nGeog. Soc._ (N. Y. 1876); Draper’s _Intellectual Development of\r\nEurope_; Brasseur’s _Ms. Troano_; Humboldt’s _Cosmos_ (English transl.\r\nii. 674); Michel Chevalier in the _Revue de deux Mondes_, Mar.-July,\r\n1845, embraced later in his _Du Méxique avant et pendant la Conquête_\r\n(Paris, 1845); Brantz Mayer’s _Mexico as it was; The Galaxy_, March,\r\n1876; _Scribner’s Mag._ v. 724; _Overland Monthly_, xiv. 468; De\r\nCharency’s _Hist. du Civilisation du Méxique_ (_Revue des Questions\r\nhistoriques_), vi. 283; Dabry de Thiersant’s _Origine des indiens\r\ndu Nouveau Monde_ (Paris, 1883); Peschel’s _Races of Men_, 441;\r\nNadaillac’s _Les premiers hommes et les temps préhistoriques_, ii. ch.\r\n9, etc.\r\n\r\n[998] For the bibliography of his works see Brunet, Sabin, Field,\r\netc. The octavo edition of his _Vues_ has 19 of the 69 plates which\r\nconstitute the _Atlas_ of the large edition. See the chapter on Peru\r\nfor further detail.\r\n\r\n[999] John Lloyd Stephens, _Incidents of travel in Central America,\r\nChiapas, and Yucatan_, Lond. and N. Y. 1841,—various later eds.,\r\nthat of London, 1854, being “revised from the latest Amer. ed., with\r\nadditions by Frederick Catherwood.” Stephens started on this expedition\r\nin 1839, and he was armed with credentials from President Van Buren.\r\nHe travelled 3000 miles, and visited eight ruined cities, as shown by\r\nhis route given on the map in vol. i. Cf. references in Allibone, ii.\r\np. 2240; _Poole’s Index_, p. 212; his _Incidents of Travel in Yucatan_\r\nwill be mentioned later.\r\n\r\nFrederick Catherwood’s _Views of Ancient Monuments in Central America,\r\nChiapas, and Yucatan_ (Lond. 1844) has a brief text (pp. 24) and 25\r\nlithographed plates. Some of the original drawings used in making\r\nthese plates were included in the _Squier Catalogue_, p. 229. (Sabin’s\r\n_Dict._ iii. no. 11520.) Captain Lindesay Brine, in his paper on the\r\n“Ruined Cities of Central America” (_Journal Roy. Geog. Soc._ 1872,\r\np. 354; _Proc._ xvii. 67), testifies to the accuracy of Stephens and\r\nCatherwood. These new developments furnished the material for numerous\r\npurveyors to the popular mind, some of them of the slightest value,\r\nlike Asahel Davis, whose _Antiquities of Central America_, with some\r\nslight changes of title, and with the parade of new editions, were\r\ncommon enough between 1840 and 1850.\r\n\r\n[1000] Viollet le Duc, in his _Histoire de l’habitation humaine\r\ndepuis les temps préhistoriques_ (Paris, 1875), has given a chapter\r\n(no. xxii.) to the “Nahuas and Toltecs.” Views more or less studied,\r\ncomprehensive, and restricted are given in R. Cary Long’s _Ancient\r\nArchitecture of America, its historic value and parallelism of\r\ndevelopment with the architecture of the Old World_ (N. Y. 1849), an\r\naddress from the _N. Y. Hist. Soc. Proc._ 1849, p. 117; R. P. Greg on\r\n“the Fret or Key Ornament in Mexico and Peru,” in the _Archæologia_\r\n(London), vol. xlvii. 157; and a popular summary on “the pyramid\r\nin America,” by S. D. Peet, in the _American Antiquarian_, July,\r\n1888, comparing the mounds of Cholula, Uxmal, Palenqué, Teotihuacan,\r\nCopan, Quemada, Cohokia, St. Louis, etc. John T. Short summarizes the\r\ncharacteristics of the Nahua and Maya styles (_No. Amer. of Antiquity_,\r\n340, 359). There are chapters on their architecture in Bancroft, _Nat.\r\nRaces_, ii.; but the references in his vol. iv. are most helpful.\r\n\r\n[1001] Vols. v. vi. vii. on “Ancient Mexican Civilization,” “Pyramid of\r\nTeotihuacan,” “Sacrificial Calendar Stone,” “Central America at time of\r\nConquest,” “Ruins at Palenque and Copan,” “Ruins of Uxmal,” etc.\r\n\r\n[1002] Duplicates were placed in the Nat. Museum at Washington by the\r\nliberality of Pierre Lorillard.\r\n\r\n[1003] The English translation is condensed in parts: _The ancient\r\ncities of the New World: being travels and explorations in Mexico\r\nand Central America from 1857-1882_. _Translated from the French by\r\nJ. Gonino and Helen S. Conant._ (London, 1887.) Some of his notable\r\nresults were the discovery of stucco ornaments in the province of\r\nIturbide, among ruins which he unfortunately named Lorillard City (Eng.\r\ntr. ch. 22). The palace at Tula is also figured in Brocklehurst’s\r\n_Mexico to-day_, ch. 25. The discovery of what Charnay calls glass and\r\nporcelain is looked upon as doubtful by most archæologists, who believe\r\nthe specimens to be rather traces of Spanish contact.\r\n\r\n[1004] Bancroft, iv. 453, and references.\r\n\r\n[1005] Bandelier (p. 235) is confident that it was built by an earlier\r\npeople than the Nahuas.\r\n\r\n[1006] Cf. Bandelier, p. 247. Short, p. 236.\r\n\r\n[1007] Bancroft (v. 200) gives references on these points, and\r\nparticular note may be taken of Veytia, i. 18, 155, 199; and Brasseur,\r\n_Hist. Nations Civ._ iv. 182. Cf. also Nadaillac, p. 351. Bandelier\r\n(_Archæolog. Tour_, 248, 249) favors the gradual growth theory, and\r\ncollates early sources (p. 250). Bancroft (iv. 474) holds that we may\r\nfeel very sure its erection dates back of the tenth, and perhaps of the\r\nseventh, century.\r\n\r\n[1008] Bandelier’s idea (p. 254) is that as the Indians never repair\r\na ruin, they abandoned this remaining mound after its disaster, and\r\ntransplanted the worship of Quetzalcoatl to the new mound, since\r\ndestroyed, while the old shrine was in time given to the new cult of\r\nthe Rain-god.\r\n\r\n[1009] As Bancroft thinks; but Bandelier says that it was not of this\r\nmound, but of the temple which stood where the modern convent stands,\r\nthat this count was made. _Arch.

Mex._, and in\r\nKingsborough, v. 218; with iv. pl. viii.). Bancroft remarks on the\r\ntotally different aspects of Castañeda’s two drawings. Nebel, in his\r\n_Viaje pintoresco y Arqueolójico sobre la república Mejicana_, 1829-34\r\n(Paris, 1839, folio), gave a description and a large colored drawing.\r\nOf the other visitors whose accounts add something to our knowledge,\r\nBancroft (iv. 471) notes the following: J. R. Poinsett, _Notes on\r\nMexico_ (London, 1825). W. H. Bullock, _Six Months in Mexico_ (Lond.,\r\n1825). H. G. Ward, _Mexico in 1827_ (Lond., 1828). Mark Beaufoy, _Mex.\r\nIllustrations_ (Lond., 1828), with cuts. Charles Jos. Latrobe, _Rambles\r\nin Mexico_ (Lond., 1836). Brantz Mayer, _Mexico as it was_ (N. Y.,\r\n1854); _Mexico, Aztec, etc._ (Hartford, 1853); and in Schoolcraft,\r\n_Ind. Tribes_, vi. 582. Waddy Thompson, _Recoll. of Mexico_ (N. Y.,\r\n1847). E. B. Tylor, _Anahuac_ (Lond., 1861), p. 274. A. S. Evans, _Our\r\nSister Republic_ (Hartford, 1870). Summaries later than Bancroft’s will\r\nbe found in Short, p. 369, and Nadaillac, p. 350. Bancroft adds (iv.\r\n471-2) a long list of second-hand describers.\r\n\r\n[1012] It is illustrated with a map of the district of Cholula (p.\r\n158), a detailed plan of the pyramid or mound (Humboldt is responsible\r\nfor the former term) as it stands amid roads and fields (p. 230), and a\r\nfac-simile of an old map of the pueblo of Cholula (1581).\r\n\r\nBandelier speaks of the conservative tendencies of the native\r\npopulation of this region, giving a report that old native idols are\r\nstill preserved and worshipped in caves, to which he could not induce\r\nthe Indians to conduct him (p. 156); and that when he went to see\r\nthe _Mapa de Cuauhtlantzinco_, or some native pictures of the 16th\r\ncentury, representing the Conquest, and of the highest importance for\r\nits history, he was jealously allowed but one glance at them, and could\r\nnot get another (_Archæol. Tour_, p. 123). He adds: “The difficulty\r\nattending the consultation of any documents in the hands of Indians is\r\nuniversal, and results from their superstitious regard for writings on\r\npaper. The bulk of the people watch with the utmost jealousy over their\r\nold papers.... They have a fear lest the power vested in an original\r\nmay be transferred to a copy” (pp. 155-6).\r\n\r\n[1013] Pinart, no. 590.\r\n\r\n[1014] He repeats Alzate’s plate of the restoration of the ruins.\r\n\r\n[1015] Bancroft refers (iv. 483) to various compiled accounts, to which\r\nmay be added his own and Short’s (p. 371). Cf. F. Boncourt in the\r\n_Revue d’Ethnographie_ (1887).\r\n\r\n[1016] Prescott, Kirk ed., i. 12. See the map of the plateau of Anahuac\r\nin Ruge, _Gesch. des Zeitalters der Entdeck._, i. 363.\r\n\r\n[1017] Cf. Gros in the _Archives de la Com. Scient. du Méxique_, vol.\r\ni.; H. de Saussure on the _Découverte des ruines d’une ancienne ville\r\nMéxicaine située sur le plateau de l’Anahuac_ (Paris, 1858,—_Bull. Soc\r\nGéog. de Paris_).\r\n\r\n[1018] The same is true of the earliest Spanish buildings. Icazbalceta\r\n(_México en 1554_, p. 74) says that the soil is constantly\r\naccumulating, and the whole city gradually sinks.\r\n\r\n[1019] Bancroft (iv. 505, 516, with references) says that such objects,\r\nwhen brought to light by excavations, have not always been removed from\r\ntheir hiding-places; and he argues that beneath the city there may yet\r\nbe “thousands of interesting monuments.” Cf. B. Mayer’s _Mexico as it\r\nwas_, vol. ii.\r\n\r\nBandelier (_Archæol. Tour_, Part ii. p. 49) gives us valuable\r\n“Archæological Notes about the City of Mexico,” in which he says\r\nthat Alfredo Chavero owns a very large oil painting, said to have\r\nbeen executed in 1523, giving a view of the aboriginal city and the\r\nprincipal events of the Conquest. It shows that the ancient city was\r\nabout one quarter the size of the modern town.\r\n\r\nWe find descriptions of the city before the conquerors transformed\r\nit, in Brasseur’s _Hist. Nations Civ._ iii. 187; iv. line 13; and in\r\nBancroft (ii. ch. 18) there is a collation of authorities on Nahua\r\nbuildings, with specific references on the city of Mexico (ii. p. 567).\r\nBandelier describes with citations its military aspects at the time of\r\nthe Conquest (_Peabody Mus. Reports_, x. 151).\r\n\r\nThe movable relics found in Mexico are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. The calendar stone. See annexed cut.\r\n\r\n2. Teoyamique. See cut in the appendix of this volume.\r\n\r\n3. Sacrificial stone. See annexed cut.\r\n\r\n4. Indio triste. See annexed cut.\r\n\r\n5. Head of a serpent, discovered in 1881. Cf. Bandelier’s _Archæol.\r\nTour_, p. 69.\r\n\r\n6. Human head. Cf. Bancroft, iv. 518. All of the above, except the\r\ncalendar stone, are in the Museo Nacional.\r\n\r\n7. Gladiatorial stone, discovered in 1792, but left buried. Cf. B.\r\nMayer’s _Mexico_, 123; Bancroft, iv. 516; Kingsborough, vii. 94;\r\nSahagún, lib. ii.\r\n\r\n8. A few other less important objects. Cf. Bandelier, _Archæol. Tour_,\r\n52.\r\n\r\nAntonio de Leon y Gama, who unfortunately had no knowledge of the\r\nwritings of Sahagún, has discussed most of these relics in his\r\n_Descripcion histórico y Cronológico de las dos Piedras &_. (2d ed.\r\nBustamante, 1832.)\r\n\r\n[1020] Bancroft, iv. 520, with authorities, p. 523. Cf. _American\r\nAntiquarian_, May, 1888.\r\n\r\n[1021] Bancroft’s numerous references make a foot-note (iv. 530). He\r\nadds a plan from Almaraz, and says that the description of Linares\r\n(_Soc. Mex. Geog. Boletin_, 30, i. 103) is mainly drawn from Almaraz.\r\nIt is believed, but not absolutely proven, that the mounds were natural\r\nones, artificially shaped (Bandelier, 44). The extent of the ruins\r\nis very great, and it is a current belief that the city in its prime\r\nmust have been very large. The whole region is exceptionally rich in\r\nfragmentary and small relics, like pottery, obsidian implements, and\r\nterra-cotta heads. Cf. for these last, _Lond. Geog. Soc. Journal_,\r\nvii. 10; Thompson’s _Mexico_, 140; Nebel, _Viaje_; Mayer’s _Mexico as\r\nit was_, 227 (as cited in Bancroft, iv. 542); and later publications\r\nlike T. U. Brocklehurst’s _Mexico to-day_ (Lond., 1883), and Zelia\r\nNuttall’s “Terra Cotta Heads from Teotihuacan,” in the _Amer. Journal\r\nof Archæology_ (June and Sept. 1886), ii. 157, 318.\r\n\r\nBancroft judges that the ruins date back to the sixth century, and\r\nsays that these mounds served for models of the Aztec teocallis. On\r\nthe commission already referred to was Antonio García y Cubas, who\r\nconducted some personal explorations, and in describing these in a\r\nseparate publication, _Ensayo de un Estudio Comparativo entre las\r\nPirámides Egípcias y Mexicanas_ (Mexico, 1871), he points out certain\r\nanalogies of the American and Egyptian structures, which will be found\r\nin epitome in Bancroft (iv. 543). In discussing the monoliths of the\r\nruins, Amos W. Butler (_Amer. Antiquarian_, May, 1885), in a paper\r\non “The Sacrificial Stone of San Juan Teotihuacan,” advanced some\r\nviews that are controverted by W. H. Holmes in the _Amer. Journal of\r\nArchæology_ (i. 361), from whose foot-notes a good bibliography of the\r\nsubject can be derived. Bandelier (_Archæol. Tour_, 42) thinks that\r\nbecause no specific mention is made of them in Mexican tradition, it is\r\nsafe to infer that these monuments antedate the Mexicans, and were in\r\nruins at the time of the Conquest.\r\n\r\n[1022] The early writers make little mention of the place except as\r\none of the halting-places of the Aztec migration. Torquemada has\r\nsomething to say (quoted in _Soc. Mex. Geog. Bol._, 2º, iii. 278, with\r\nthe earliest of the modern accounts by Manuel Gutierrez, in 1805).\r\nCapt. G. F. Lyon (_Journal of a residence and tour in Mexico_, London,\r\n1828) visited the ruins in 1828. Pedro Rivera in 1830 described them\r\nin Márcos de Esparza’s _Informe presentado al Gobierno_ (Zacatecas,\r\n1830,—also in _Museo Méxicano_, i. 185, 1843). The plan in Nebel’s\r\nViaje (copied in Bancroft, iv. 582) was made for Governor García, by\r\nBerghes, a German engineer, in 1831, who at the time was accompanied by\r\nJ. Burkart (_Aufenthalt und Reisen in Mexico_, Stuttgart, 1836), who\r\ngives a plan of fewer details. Bancroft (iv. 579) thinks Nebel’s views\r\nof the ruins the only ones ever published, and he enumerates various\r\nsecond-hand writers (iv. 579).\r\n\r\nCf. Fegeux, “Les ruines de la Quemada,” in the _Revue d’Ethnologie_, i.\r\n119. The noticeable features of these ruins are their massiveness and\r\nheight of walls, their absence of decoration and carved idols, and the\r\nlack of pottery and the smaller relics. Their history, notwithstanding\r\nmuch search, is a blank.\r\n\r\n[1023] Cf. Bandelier, p. 320.\r\n\r\n[1024] Bandelier, p. 276.\r\n\r\n[1025] Ramirez, ed. 1867.\r\n\r\n[1026] His brief account is copied by Mendieta and Torquemada, and is\r\ncited in Bandelier, p. 324.\r\n\r\n[1027] _Geog.

Field, no. 1612.\r\n\r\n[1030] _Ruines_, etc., 261, and Viollet le Duc, p. 74; _Anciens\r\nVilles_, ch. 24.\r\n\r\n[1031] There is a _Rapport sur les ruines_, by Doutrelaine, in the\r\n_Archives de la Commission Scientifique du Méxique_ (vol. iii.);\r\nNadaillac (p. 364) and Short (p. 361) have epitomized results, and\r\nLouis H. Aymé gives some _Notes on Mitla_ in the _Amer. Antiq. Soc.\r\nProc._, April, 1882, p. 82; Bancroft (iv. 391) enumerates various\r\nsecond-hand descriptions.\r\n\r\n[1032] I do not understand Bandelier’s statement (p. 277) that it is\r\ntaken from Bancroft’s plan, which it only resembles in a general way.\r\n\r\n[1033] Bancroft classifies their architectural peculiarities (iv. pp.\r\n267-279).\r\n\r\n[1034] See Vol. II. ch. 3. Bancroft (ii. p. 784) collates the early\r\naccounts of the habitations of the people, and (iv. 254, 260, 261) the\r\ndescriptions of the ruins and statelier edifices, as seen by these\r\nexplorers.\r\n\r\n[1035] _For.

Proc._, n. s., i. 92, calls the\r\npaper “not very valuable.”\r\n\r\n[1040] This gentleman, since the death of his father, of the same name,\r\nsucceeded, after an interval, the elder antiquary in the president’s\r\nchair of the American Antiquarian Society.\r\n\r\n[1041] Cf. Short, p. 396. Le Plongeon retorts (_Amer. Antiq. Soc.\r\nProc._, n. s., i. 282) by telling his critic that he had never been\r\nin Yucatan. Considering the effect of contact in many of those who\r\nhave written of the ruins, it may be a question if the implication is\r\nvaluable as a piece of criticism. Mr. Salisbury and Dr. Le Plongeon\r\nreported from time to time in the _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._ the results\r\nof the latter’s investigations, and the researches to which they gave\r\nrise. Those in April, 1876, and April, 1877, of these _Proceedings_,\r\nwere privately printed by Mr. Salisbury, as _The Mayas_, etc. In\r\nApril, 1878, Mr. Salisbury reported upon the “Terra-cotta figures from\r\nIsla Mujeres.” In Oct., 1878, there were communications from Dr. Le\r\nPlongeon, and from Alice D. Le Plongeon, his wife. In April, 1879, Dr.\r\nLe Plongeon communicated a letter on the affinities of Central America\r\nand the East. Since this the Le Plongeons have found other channels\r\nof communication. Dr. Le Plongeon expanded his somewhat extravagant\r\nnotions of Oriental affinities in his _Sacred mysteries among the\r\nMayas and the Quiches, 11,500 years ago; their relation to the sacred\r\nmysteries of Egypt, Greece, Chaldea, and India. Freemasonry in times\r\nanterior to the temple of Solomon_ (New York, 1886).\r\n\r\nHis preface is largely made up with a rehearsal of his rebuffs and in\r\ncomplaints of the want of public appreciation of his labors. He is,\r\nhowever, as confident as ever, and deciphers the bas-reliefs and mural\r\ninscriptions of Chichen-Itza by “the ancient hieratic Maya alphabet”\r\nwhich he claims to have discovered, and shows this alphabet in parallel\r\ncolumns with that of Egypt as displayed by Champollion and Bunsen. Mrs.\r\nLe Plongeon published her _Vestiges of the Mayas_ in New York, in 1881,\r\nand gathered some of her periodical writings in her _Here and There\r\nin Yucatan_ (N. Y., 1886). Cf. her letter on the ancient records of\r\nYucatan in _The Nation_, xxix. 224.\r\n\r\n[1042] Baldwin (p. 125), in a condensed way, and likewise Short (ch.\r\n8) and Bancroft (iv. ch. 5), more at length, have mainly depended on\r\nStephens. Cf. references in Bancroft, iv. 147, and Bandelier’s list in\r\nthe _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, n. s., i. 82, 95. E. H. Thompson has\r\ncontributed papers in _Ibid._ Oct., 1886, p. 248, and April, 1887, p.\r\n379, and on the ruins of Kich-Moo and Chun-Kal-Cin in April, 1888, p.\r\n162. Brasseur, beside his _Hist. Nat. Civ._, ii. 20, has something in\r\nhis introduction to his _Relation de Landa_. The description of the\r\nruins at Zayi, which Stephens gives, shows that some of the rooms were\r\nfilled solid with masonry, and he leaves it as an unaccountable fact;\r\nbut Morgan (_Houses and House Life_, p. 267) thinks it shows that the\r\nbuilders constructed a core of masonry, over which they reared the\r\nwalls and ceilings, which last, after hardening, were able to support\r\nthemselves, when the cores were removed; and that in the ruins at Zayi\r\nwe see the cores unremoved.\r\n\r\n[1043] Cf. the _pros_ and _cons_ in Waldeck and Charnay. Waldeck first\r\nnamed the ornaments as “Elephants’ trunks” (_Voy. Pitt._ p. 74). There\r\nare cuts in Stephens, reproduced in Bancroft. There is also a cut in\r\nNorman. Cf. E. H. Thompson in _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, April, 1887,\r\np. 382.\r\n\r\n[1044] Stephens, _Yucatan_, ii. 265, gives an ancient Indian map\r\n(1557), and extracts from the archives of Mani, which lead him to infer\r\nthat at that time it was an inhabited Indian town.\r\n\r\n[1045] Bancroft (iv. 151) gives various references to second-hand\r\ndescriptions, noted before 1875, to which may be added those in Short,\r\np. 347; Nadaillac, 334; Amer. Antiquarian, vii. 257, and again, July,\r\n1888.\r\n\r\nProbably the most accurate of the plans of the ruins is that of\r\nStephens (_Yucatan_, i. 165), which is followed by Bancroft (iv.\r\n153). Brasseur’s report has a plan, and others, all differing, are\r\ngiven by Waldeck (pl. viii.), Norman (p. 155), and Charnay (_Ruines_,\r\np. 62). Views and cuts of details are found in Waldeck, Stephens,\r\nCharnay,—whence later summarizers like Bancroft, Baldwin, and Short\r\nhave drawn their copies; while special cuts are copied in Armin (_Das\r\nHeutige Mexico_); Larenaudière (_Mexique et Guatemala_, Paris, 1847);\r\nLe Plongeon (_Sacred Mysteries_); Ruge (_Zeitalter der Entdeckungen_,\r\np. 357); Morgan (_Houses_, etc., ch. xi.), and in various others. One\r\ncan best trace the varieties and contrasts of the different accounts of\r\nthe various edifices in Bancroft’s collations of their statements. His\r\nconstant citation, even to scorn them, of the impertinencies of George\r\nJones’s _Hist. of Anc. America_ (London, 1842),—the later notorious\r\nCount Johannes,—was hardly worth while.\r\n\r\n[1046] Landa described the ruins. _Relation_, p. 340.\r\n\r\n[1047] All other accounts are based on these. Bancroft, who gives the\r\nbest summary (iv. 221), enumerates many of the second-hand writers,\r\nto whom Short (p. 396) must be added. Stephens gives a plan (ii. 290)\r\nwhich Bancroft (iv. 222) follows; and it apparently is worthy of\r\nreasonable confidence, which cannot be said of Norman’s. The ruins\r\npresent some features not found in others, and the most interesting of\r\nsuch may be considered the wall paintings, one representing a boat with\r\noccupants, which Stephens found on the walls of the building called by\r\nhim the Gymnasium, because of stone rings projecting from the walls\r\n(see annexed cut), which were supposed by him to have been used in ball\r\ngames. Norman calls the same building the Temple; Charnay, the Cirque;\r\nbut the native designation is Iglesia.\r\n\r\n[1048] _Yucatan_, i. 94. Cf. Bancroft, _Native Races_, ii. 117; v. 164,\r\n342.\r\n\r\n[1049] Bancroft collates the views of different writers (iv. 285).\r\nHe himself holds that these buildings are more ancient than those of\r\nAnáhuac; consequently he rejects the arguments of Stephens, that it\r\nwas by the Toltecs, after they migrated south from Anáhuac, that these\r\nconstructions were raised (_Native Races_, v. 165, and for references,\r\np. 169). Charnay (_Bull. de la Soc. de Géog._, Nov., 1881) believes\r\nthey were erected between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nIt is well known now that the concentric rings are a useless guide in\r\ntropical regions to determine the age of trees, though in the past,\r\nthe immense size of trees as well as the deposition of soil have been\r\nused to determine the supposed ages of ruins. Waldeck counted a ring a\r\nyear in getting two thousand years for the time since the abandonment\r\nof Palenqué; but Charnay (Eng. tr. _Ancient Cities_, p. 260) says that\r\nthese rings are often formed monthly. Cf. Nadaillac, p. 323.\r\n\r\n[1050] So called because near a modern village of that name, founded\r\nby the Spaniards about 1564. Bancroft (iv. 296) says the ruins are\r\nordinarily called by the natives Casas de Piedra. Ordoñez calls them\r\nNachan, but without giving any authority, and some adopt the Aztec\r\nequivalent Calhuacan, city of the serpents. Because Xibalba is held by\r\nsome to be the name of the great city of this region in the shadowy\r\ndays of Votan, that name has also been applied to the ruins. Otolum, or\r\nthe ruined place, is a common designation thereabouts, but Palenqué is\r\nthe appellation in use by most travellers and writers.\r\n\r\n[1051] The fact is, that widely distinct estimates have been held, some\r\ndating them back into the remotest antiquity, and others making them\r\nlater than the Conquest. Bancroft (iv. 362) collates these statements.\r\nCf. Dr. Earl Flint in _Amer. Antiquarian_, iv. 289. Morelet identifies\r\nthem with the Toltec remains, supposing them to be the work of that\r\npeople after their emigration, and to be of about the same age as\r\nMitla. Charnay (_Anc. Cities of the New World_, p. 260) claims that\r\nCortes knew the place as the religious metropolis of the Acaltecs. On\r\nthe question of Cortes’ knowledge see _Science_, Feb. 27, 1885, p. 171;\r\nand _Ibid._ (by Brinton) March 27, 1885, p. 248.\r\n\r\n[1052] The original is in the Roy. Acad. of Hist. at Madrid (Brasseur,\r\n_Bib. Mex.-Guat._, p. 125), and is called _Descripcion del terreno\r\npublacion antigua_.\r\n\r\n[1053] Field, no. 231; Sabin, xvii. p. 292. The report of Rio was\r\nbrief, and as we would judge now, superficial. Dupaix treats him\r\ndisparagingly. The appended essay by Cabrera, an Italian, is said\r\nto have been largely filched from Ramon’s paper, which had been\r\nconfidentially placed in his hands (Short, 207). A Spanish text of\r\nCabrera is in the Museo Nacional. Cf. Brasseur (_Bib. Mex.-Guat._), p.\r\n30; Pinart, no. 186. It is a question if the plates, which constituted\r\nthe most interesting part of the English book, be Rio’s after all;\r\nfor though they profess to be engraved after his drawings, they are\r\nsuspiciously like those made by Castañeda, twenty years after Rio’s\r\nvisit (Bancroft, iv. 290). David B. Warden translated Rio’s report\r\nin the _Recueil de voyages et de Mémoires, par la Soc. de in Géog.\r\nde Paris_. (vol. ii.), and gave some of the plates. (Cf. Warden’s\r\n_Recherches sur les antiquités de l’Amérique Septentrionale_, Paris,\r\n1827, in _Mém. de la Soc. de Géog._) There is a German version,\r\n_Beschreibung einer alten Stadt_ (Berlin, 1832), by J. H. von Minutoli,\r\nwhich is provided with an introductory essay.\r\n\r\n[1054] Sabin, x. 209, 213. Cf. _Annales de Philos. Chrétienne_, xi.\r\n\r\n[1055] _Bull. de la Soc. de Géog. de Paris_, ix.

Proc._, n. s., i. p. 111).\r\n\r\n[1057] The report by Angrand, which induced this purchase, is in the\r\nwork as published.\r\n\r\n[1058] He had described them in his _Hist. Nat. Civ._, i. ch. 3.\r\n\r\n[1059] The book usually sells for about 150 francs.\r\n\r\n[1060] Given, also enlarged, in the folio known as Catherwood’s _Views_.\r\n\r\n[1061] The German version was made from this (Jena, 1872).\r\n\r\n[1062] Particularly ch. 13, 14. Charnay is the last of the explorers\r\nof Palenqué. All the other accounts of the ruins found here and there\r\nare based on the descriptions of those who have been named, or at\r\nleast nothing is added of material value by other actual visitors like\r\nNorman (_Rambles in Yucatan_, p. 284). Bancroft (iv. 294) enumerates\r\na number of such second-hand describers. The most important work\r\nsince Bancroft’s summary is Manuel Larrainzar’s _Estudios sobre la\r\nhistoria de America, sus ruinas y antigüedades, y sobre el orígen de\r\nsus habitantes_ (Mexico, 1875-78), in five vols., all of whose plates\r\nare illustrations from the ruins of Palenqué, which are described and\r\ncompared with other ancient remains throughout the world. Cf. Brühl,\r\n_Culturvölker d. alt. Amerikas_. Plans of the ruins will be found in\r\nWaldeck (pl. vii., followed mainly by Bancroft, iv. 298, 307), Stephens\r\n(ii. 310), Dupaix (pl. xi.), Kingsborough (iv. pl. 13), and Charnay\r\n(ch. 13 and 14). The views of the ruins given by these authorities\r\nmainly make up the stock of cuts in all the popular narratives.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of the carvings is what is known as the Tablet of\r\nthe Cross, which was taken from one of the minor buildings, and is now\r\nin the National Museum at Washington. It has often been engraved, but\r\nsuch representations never satisfied the student till they could be\r\ntested by the best of Charnay’s photographs. (Engravings in Brasseur\r\nand Waldeck, pl. 21, 22; Rosny’s _Essai sur le déchiffrement_, etc.;\r\nMinutoli’s _Beschreibung einer alten Stadt in Guatimala_ (Berlin,\r\n1832); Stephens’s _Cent. Amer._, ii.; Bancroft, _Nat. Races_, iv. 333;\r\nCharnay, _Les anciens Villes_, and Eng. transl. p. 255; Nadaillac,\r\n325; _Powell’ s Rept._, i. 221; cf. p. 234; _Amer. Antiquarian_, vii.\r\n200.) The most important discussion of the tablet is Charles Rau’s\r\n_Palenqué Tablet in the U. S. National Museum_ (Washington, 1879),\r\nbeing the _Smithsonian Contri. to Knowledge_, no. 331, or vol. xxii.\r\nIt contains an account of the explorations that have been made at\r\nPalenqué, and a chapter on the “Aboriginal writing in Mexico, Central\r\nAmerica, and Yucatan, with some account of the attempted translations\r\nof Maya hieroglyphics.” Rau’s conclusion is that it is a Phallic\r\nsymbol. Cf. a summary in _Amer. Antiquarian_, vi., Jan., 1884, and\r\nin _Amer. Art Review_, 1880, p. 217. Rau’s paper was translated into\r\nSpanish and French: _Tablero del Palenque en el Museo nacional de los\r\nEstados-Unidos_ [traducido por Joaquin Davis y Miguel Perez], in the\r\n_Anales del Museo nacional_. Tomo 2, pp. 131-203. (México, 1880.) _La\r\nStèle de Palenqué du Musée national des Etats-Unis, à Washington.\r\nTraduit de l’Anglais avec autorisation de l’auteur._ In the _Annales du\r\nMusée Guimet_, vol. x. (Paris, 1887.) Rau’s views were criticised by\r\nMorgan.\r\n\r\nThere are papers by Charency on the interpretation of the hieroglyphs\r\nin _Le Muséon_ (Paris, 1882, 1883).\r\n\r\nThe significance of the cross among the Nahuas and Mayas has been\r\nthe subject of much controversy, some connecting it with a possible\r\nearly association with Christians in ante-Columbian days (Bancroft,\r\niii. 468). On this later point see Bamps, _Les traditions relatives\r\nà l’homme blanc et au signe de la cruz en Amérique à l’Epoque\r\nprécolumbienne_, in the _Compte rendu, Congrès des Américanistes_\r\n(Copenhagen, 1883), p. 125; and “Supposed vestiges of early Christian\r\nteaching in America,” in the _Catholic Historical Researches_ (vol. i.,\r\nOct., 1885). The symbolism is variously conceived. Bandelier (_Archæol.\r\nJour._) holds it to be the emblem of fire, indeed an ornamented\r\nfire-drill, which later got mixed up with the Spanish crucifix. Brinton\r\n(_Myths of the New World_, 95) sees in it the four cardinal points,\r\nthe rain-bringers, the symbol of life and health, and cites (p. 96)\r\nvarious of the early writers in proof. Brinton (_Am. Hero Myths_, 155)\r\nclaims to have been the first to connect the Palenqué cross with the\r\nfour cardinal points. The bird and serpent—the last shown better in\r\nCharnay’s photograph than in Stephens’s cut—is (_Myths_, 119) simply\r\na rebus of the air-god, the ruler of the winds. Brinton says that\r\nWaldeck, in a paper on the tablet in the _Revue Américaine_ (ii. 69),\r\ncame to a similar conclusion. Squier (_Nicaragua_, ii. 337) speaks of\r\nthe common error of mistaking the tree of life of the Mexicans for the\r\nChristian symbol. Cf. Powell’s _Second Rept., Bur. of Ethnol._, p. 208;\r\nthe _Fourth Rept._, p. 252, where discredit is thrown upon Gabriel\r\nde Mortillet’s _Le Signe de la cross avant le Christianisme_ (Paris,\r\n1866); Joly’s _Man before Metals_, 339; and Charnay’s _Les Anciens\r\nVilles_ (or Eng. transl. p. 85). Cf. for various applications the\r\nreferences in Bancroft’s index (v. p. 671).\r\n\r\n[1063] Both were alike, and one was broken in two. There are engravings\r\nin Waldeck, pl. 25; Stephens, ii. 344, 349; Squier’s _Nicaragua_, 1856,\r\nii. 337; Bancroft, iv. 337.\r\n\r\n[1064] These have been the subject of an elaborate folio, thought,\r\nhowever, to be of questionable value, _Die Steinbildwerke von Copân\r\nund Quiriguâ, aufgenommen von Heinrich Meye; historisch erläutert und\r\nbeschrieben von Dr. Julius Schmidt_ (Berlin, 1883), of which there is\r\nan English translation, _The stone sculptures of Copán and Quiriguá_;\r\ntranslated from the German by A.D. Savage (New York, 1883). It gives\r\ntwenty plates, Catherwood’s plates, and the cuts in Stephens, with\r\nreproductions in accessible books (Bancroft, iv. ch. 3; Powell’s\r\n_First Rept. Bur. Ethn._ 224; Ruge’s _Gesch. des Zeitalters; Amer.\r\nAntiquarian_, viii. 204-6), will serve, however, all purposes.\r\n\r\n[1065] Squier says: “There are various reasons for believing that both\r\nCopan and Quirigua antedate Olosingo and Palenqué, precisely as the\r\nlatter antedate the ruins of Quiché, Chichen-Itza, and Uxmal, and that\r\nall of them were the work of the same people, or of nations of the same\r\nrace, dating from a high antiquity, and in blood and language precisely\r\nthe same that was found in occupation of the country by the Spaniards.”\r\n\r\n[1066] Named apparently from a neighboring village.\r\n\r\n[1067] Ref. in Bancroft, iv. 79.\r\n\r\n[1068] This account can be found in Pacheco’s _Col. Doc. inéd._ vi. 37,\r\nin Spanish; in Ternaux’s _Coll._ (1840), imperfect, and in the _Nouv.\r\nAnnales des Voyages_, 1843, v. xcvii. p. 18, in French; in Squier’s\r\n_Cent. America_, 242, and in his ed. of Palacio (N. Y. 1860), in\r\nEnglish; and in Alexander von Frantzius’s _San Salvador und Honduras im\r\nJahre_ 1576, with notes by the translator and by C. H. Berendt.\r\n\r\n[1069] Stephens, _Cent. Am._, i. 131, 144; Warden, 71; _Nouvelles\r\nAnnales des Voyages_, xxxv. 329; Bancroft, iv. 82; _Bull. de la Soc. de\r\nGéog. de Paris_, 1836, v. 267; Short, 56, 82,—not to name others.\r\n\r\n[1070] His account is in the _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Trans._, ii.; _Bull.\r\nSoc. de Géog._ 1835; Dupaix, a summary, i. div. 2, p. 73; Bradford’s\r\n_Amer. Antiq._, in part. Galindo’s drawings are unknown. Stephens calls\r\nhis account “unsatisfactory and imperfect.”\r\n\r\n[1071] _Central America_, i. ch. 5-7; _Views of Anc. Mts._ It is\r\nStephens’s account which has furnished the basis of those given by\r\nBancroft (iv. ch. 3); Baldwin, p. 111; Short, 356; Nadaillac, 328, and\r\nall others. Bancroft in his bibliog. note (iv. pp. 79-81), which has\r\nbeen collated with my own notes, mentions others of less importance,\r\nparticularly the report of Center and Hardcastle to the Amer. Ethnol.\r\nSoc. in 1860 and 1862, and the photographs made by Ellerley, which\r\nBrasseur (_Hist. Nat. Civ._ i. 96; ii. 493; _Palenqué_, 8, 17) found to\r\nconfirm the drawings and descriptions of Catherwood and Stephens.\r\n\r\nStephens (_Cent. Am._, i. 133) made a plan of the ruins reproduced in\r\n_Annales des Voyages_ (1841, p. 57), which is the basis of that given\r\nby Bancroft (iv. 85). Dr. Julius Schmidt, who was a member of the\r\nSquier expedition in 1852-53, furnished the historical and descriptive\r\ntext to a work which in the English translation by A.D. Savage is\r\nknown as _Stone Sculptures of Copán and Quiriguá, drawn by Heinrich\r\nMeye_ (N. Y., 1883). What Stephens calls the Copan idols and altars\r\nare considered by Morgan (_Houses and House Life_, 257), following the\r\nanalogy of the customs of the northern Indians, to be the grave-posts\r\nand graves of Copan chiefs. Bancroft (iv. ch. 3) covers the other\r\nruins of Honduras and San Salvador; and Squier has a paper on those of\r\nTenampua in the _N. Y. Hist. Soc. Proc._, 1853.\r\n\r\n[1072] Stephens’s _Central America_, ii. ch. 7; and _Nouvelles Annales\r\ndes Voyages_, vol. lxxxviii. 376, derived from Catherwood.\r\n\r\n[1073] Other travellers who have visited them are John Baily, _Central\r\nAmerica_ (Lond. 1850); A. P. Maudsley, _Explorations in Guatemala_\r\n(Lond. 1883), with map and plans of ruins, in the _Proc. Roy. Geog.\r\nSoc._ p. 185; W. T. Brigham’s _Guatemala_ (N. Y., 1886). Bancroft\r\n(iv. 109) epitomizes the existing knowledge; but the remains seem to\r\nbe less known than any other of the considerable ruins. There are a\r\nfew later papers: G. Williams on the Antiquities of Guatemala, in\r\nthe _Smithsonian Report_, 1876; Simeon Habel’s “Sculptures of Santa\r\nLucia Cosumalhuapa in Guatemala” in the _Smithson.

Quaritch (_Catal._ 1885, nos.\r\n29040, etc.) advertised some original Mexican pictures; a native MS.\r\npictorial record of a part of the Tezcuco domain (supposed A.D. 1530),\r\nand perhaps one of the “pinturas” mentioned by Ixtlilxochitl; a colored\r\nMexican calendar on a single leaf of the same supposed date and origin;\r\nwith other MSS. of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. (Cf. also his\r\n_Catal._, Jan., Feb., 1888.)\r\n\r\nThe most important studies upon the Aztec system have been those of\r\nAubin. Cf. his _Mémoire sur la peinture didactique et l’écriture\r\nfigurative des Anciens Méxicains_, in the _Archives de la Soc.\r\nAmér. de France_, iii. 225 (_Revue Orient. et Amér._), in which he\r\ncontended for the rebus-like character of the writings. He made further\r\ncontributions to vols. iv. and v. (1859-1861). Cf. his “Examen des\r\nanciennes peintures figuratives de l’ancien Méxique,” in the new series\r\nof _Archives_, etc., vol. i.; and the introd. to Brasseur’s _Nations\r\nCivilisées_, p. xliv.\r\n\r\n[1084] Bancroft (_Nat. Races_, ii. ch. 24) translates these from Landa,\r\nPeter Martyr, Cogulludo, Villagutierre, Mendieta, Acosta, Benzoni, and\r\nHerrera, and thinks all the modern writers (whom he names, p. 770) have\r\ndrawn from these earlier ones, except, perhaps, Medel in _Nouv. Annales\r\ndes Voyages_, xcvii. 49. Cf. Wilson, _Prehistoric Man_, ii. 61. It will\r\nbe seen later that Holden discredits the belief in any phonetic value\r\nof the Maya system. But compare on the phonetic value of the Mexican\r\nand Maya systems, Brinton in _Amer. Antiquarian_ (Nov. 1886); Lazarus\r\nGeiger’s _Contrib. to the Hist. of the Development of the Human Race_\r\n(Eng. tr. by David Asher). London, 1880, p. 75; and Zelia Nuttall in\r\n_Am. Ass. Adv. Sci. Proc._, Aug. 1886.\r\n\r\n[1085] Dr. Bernoulli, who died at San Francisco, in California,\r\nin 1878, and whose labors are commemorated in a notice in the\r\n_Verhandlungen der Naturforschenden Gesellschaft_ (vi. 710) at Basle,\r\nfound at Tikal, in Guatemala, some fragments of sculptured panels of\r\nwood, bearing hieroglyphics as well as designs, which he succeeded in\r\npurchasing, and they were finally deposited in 1879 in the Ethnological\r\nMuseum in Basle, where Rosny saw them, and describes them, with\r\nexcellent photographic representations, in his _Doc. Ecrits de l’Antiq.\r\nAmér._ (p. 97). These tablets are the latest additions to be made to\r\nthe store already possessed from Palenqué, as given by Stephens in his\r\n_Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan_; those of the Temple of the\r\nCross at Palenqué, after Waldeck’s drawings in the _Archives de la Soc.\r\nAmér. de France_ (ii., 1864); that from Kabah in Yucatan, given by\r\nRosny in his _Archives Paléographiques_ (i. p. 178; Atlas, pl. xx.),\r\nand one from Chichen-Itza, figured by Le Plongeon in _L’Illustration_,\r\nFeb. 10, 1882; not to name other engravings. Rosny holds that Rau’s\r\n_Palenqué Tablet_ (Washington, 1879) gives the first really serviceably\r\naccurate reproduction of that inscription. Cf. on Maya inscriptions,\r\nBancroft, ii. 775; iv. 91, 97, 234; Morelet’s _Travels_; and Le\r\nPlongeon in _Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, n. s., i. 246. This last writer\r\nhas been thought to let his enthusiasm—not to say dogmatism—turn his\r\nhead, under which imputation he is not content, naturally (_Ibid._ p.\r\n282).\r\n\r\n[1086] “Landa’s alphabet a Spanish fabrication,” appeared in the _Amer.\r\nAntiq. Soc. Proc._, April, 1880. In this, Philipp J. J. Valentini\r\ninterprets all that the old writers say of the ancient writings to mean\r\nthat they were pictorial and not phonetic; and that Landa’s purpose\r\nwas to devise a vehicle which seemed familiar to the natives, through\r\nwhich he could communicate religious instruction. His views have been\r\ncontroverted by Léon de Rosny (_Doc. Ecrits de la Antiq. Amér._ p. 91);\r\nand Brinton (_Maya Chronicles_, 61), calls them an entire misconception\r\nof Landa’s purpose.\r\n\r\n[1087] _Am. Antiq. Soc.

In the second volume there is a translation\r\nof Gabriél de Saint Bonaventure’s _Grammaire Maya_, a “Chrestomathie”\r\nof Maya extracts, and a Maya lexicon of more than 10,000 words.\r\nBrasseur published at the same time (1869) in the _Mémoires de la\r\nSoc. d’Ethnographie a Lettre à M. Léon de Rosny sur la découverte\r\nde documents relatifs à la haute antiquité américaine, et sur le\r\ndéchiffrement et l’interprétation de l’écriture phonétique et\r\nfigurative de la langue Maya_ (Paris, 1869). He explained his\r\napplication of Landa’s alphabet in the introduction to the _MS.\r\nTroano_, i. p. 36. Brasseur later confessed he had begun at the wrong\r\nend of the MS. (_Bib. Mex.-Guat._, introd.). The pebble-shape form of\r\nthe characters induced Brasseur to call them _calculiform_; and Julien\r\nDuchateau adopted the term in his paper “Sur l’écriture calculiforme\r\ndes Mayas” in the _Annuaire de la Soc. Amér._ (Paris, 1874), iii. p. 31.\r\n\r\n[1092] _L’écriture hiératique_, and _Archives de la Soc. Am. de\r\nFrance_, n. s., ii. 35.\r\n\r\n[1093] _Ancient Phonetic Alphabets of Yucatan_ (N. Y., 1870), p. 7.\r\n\r\n[1094] It is the development of a paper given at the Nancy session\r\nof the Congrès des Américanistes (1875). Landa’s alphabet with the\r\nvariations make 262 of the 700 signs which Rosny catalogues. He printed\r\nhis “Nouvelles Recherches pour l’interpretation des caractères de\r\nl’Amérique Centrale” in the _Archives_, etc., iii. 118. There is a\r\npaper on Rosny’s studies by De la Rada in the Compte-rendu of the\r\nCopenhagen session (p. 355) of the Congrès des Américanistes. Rosny’s\r\n_Documents écrits de l’antiquité Américaine_ (Paris, 1882), from the\r\n_Mémoires de la Société d’Ethnographie_ (1881), covers his researches\r\nin Spain and Portugal for material illustrative of the pre-Columbian\r\nhistory of America.

Antiquarian_ (March, 1886) points out the\r\ncourse of his own studies in this direction.\r\n\r\n[1103] Cf. Short, p. 425. Dr. Harrison Allen in 1875, in the _Amer.\r\nPhilosophical Society’s Transactions_, made an analysis of Landa’s\r\nalphabet and the published codices. Rau, in his _Palenqué Tablet of the\r\nU. S. Nat. Museum_ (ch. 5), examines what had been done up to 1879. In\r\nthe same year Dr. Carl Schultz-Sellack wrote on “Die Amerikanischen\r\nGötter der vier Weltgegenden und ihre Tempel in Palenqué,” touching\r\nalso the question of interpretation (_Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_,\r\nvol. xi.); and in 1880 Dr. Förstemann examined the matter in his\r\nintroduction to his reproduction of the Dresden Codex.\r\n\r\n[1104] _Studies in Central American picture-writing_ (Washington,\r\n1881), extracted from the _First Report of the Bureau of Ethnology_.\r\nHis method is epitomized in _The Century_, Dec., 1881. He finds\r\nStephens’s drawings the most trustworthy of all, Waldeck’s being\r\nbeautiful, but they embody “singular liberties.” His examination was\r\nconfined to the 1500 separate hieroglyphs in Stephens’s _Central\r\nAmerica_. Some of Holden’s conclusions are worth noting: “The Maya\r\nmanuscripts do not possess to me the same interest as the stones,\r\nand I think it may be certainly said that all of them are younger\r\nthan the Palenqué tablets, far younger than the inscriptions at\r\nCopan.” “I distrust the methods of Brasseur and others who start\r\nfrom the misleading and unlucky alphabet handed down by Landa,” by\r\nforming variants, which are made “to satisfy the necessities of the\r\ninterpreter in carrying out some preconceived idea.” He finds a rigid\r\nadherence to the standard form of a character prevailing throughout\r\nthe same inscription. At Palenqué the inscriptions read as an English\r\ninscription would read, beginning at the left and proceeding line\r\nby line downward. “The system employed at Palenqué and Copan was\r\nthe same in its general character, and almost identical even in\r\ndetails.” He deciphers three proper names: “all of them have been pure\r\npicture-writing, except in so far as their rebus character may make\r\nthem in a sense phonetic.” Referring to Valentini’s _Landa Alphabet a\r\nSpanish Fabrication_, he agrees in that critic’s conclusions. “While\r\nmy own,” he adds, “were reached by a study of the stones and in the\r\ncourse of a general examination, Dr. Valentini has addressed himself\r\nsuccessfully to the solution of a special problem.” Holden thinks\r\nhis own solution of the three proper names points of departure for\r\nsubsequent decipherers. The Maya method was “pure picture-writing. At\r\nCopan this is found in its earliest state; at Palenqué it was already\r\nhighly conventionalized.”\r\n\r\n[1105] See references in Bancroft’s _Nat. Races_, ii. 576.\r\n\r\n[1106] Cogulludo’s _Hist. de Yucatan_, 3d ed., i. 604.\r\n\r\n[1107] Prescott, i. 104, and references.\r\n\r\n[1108] Dec. iv., lib. 8.\r\n\r\n[1109] Brasseur de Bourbourg’s _Troano MS._, i. 9.

A part\r\nof this work was also printed separately (fifty copies) under the\r\ntitle of _De la destruction de antigüedades méxicanas atribuida á los\r\nmisioneros en general, y particularmente al Illmo. Sr. D. Fr. Juan de\r\nZumárraga, primer Obispo y Arzobispo de México_ (Mexico, 1881). In\r\nthis he exhausts pretty much all that has been said on the subject\r\nby the bishop himself, by Pedro de Gante, Motolinía, Sahagún, Duran,\r\nAcosta, Davila Padilla, Herrera, Torquemada, Ixtlilxochitl, Robertson,\r\nClavigero, Humboldt, Bustamante, Ternaux, Prescott, Alaman, etc.\r\nBrasseur (_Nat. Civil._, ii. 4) says of Landa that we must not forget\r\nthat he was oftener the agent of the council for the Indies than of the\r\nChurch. Helps (iii. 374) is inclined to be charitable towards a man\r\nin a skeptical age, so intensely believing as Zumárraga was. Sahagún\r\nrelates that earlier than Zumárraga, the fourth ruler of his race,\r\nItzcohuatl, had caused a large destruction of native writings, in order\r\nto remove souvenirs of the national humiliation.\r\n\r\n[1111] Humboldt was one of the earliest to describe some of these\r\nmanuscripts in connection with his _Atlas_, pl. xiii.\r\n\r\n[1112] Cf. _Catal. of the Phillipps Coll._, no. 404. An original\r\ncolored copy of the _Antiquities of Mexico_, given by Kingsborough\r\nto Phillipps, was offered of late years by Quaritch at £70-£100; it\r\nwas published at £175. The usual colored copies sell now for about\r\n£40-£60; the uncolored for about £30-£35. It is usually stated that\r\ntwo copies were printed on vellum (British Museum, Bodleian), and ten\r\non large paper, which were given to crowned heads, except one, which\r\nwas given to Obadiah Rich. Squier, in the _London Athenæum_, Dec. 13,\r\n1856 (Allibone, p. 1033), drew attention to the omission of the last\r\nsignature of the _Hist. Chichimeca_ in vol. ix.\r\n\r\n[1113] Rich, _Bibl. Amer.

This seems to show that a great\r\nlength of time must have elapsed before the ancient Peruvians could\r\nhave brought the cultivation of the potato to such a high state of\r\nperfection as they undoubtedly did.\r\n\r\n[1145] Some years ago a priest named Cabrera, the cura of a village\r\ncalled Macusani, in the province of Caravaya, succeeded in breeding a\r\ncross between the wild vicuña and the tame alpaca. He had a flock of\r\nthese beautiful animals, which yielded long, silken, white wool; but\r\nthey required extreme care, and died out when the sustaining hand of\r\nCabrera was no longer available. There is also a cross between a llama\r\nand an alpaca, called _guariso_, as large as the llama, but with much\r\nmore wool. The guanaco and llama have also been known to form a cross;\r\nbut there is no instance of a cross between the two wild varieties,—the\r\nguanaco and vicuña. The extremely artificial life of the alpaca, which\r\nrenders that curious and valuable animal so absolutely dependent on the\r\nministrations of its human master, and the complete domestication of\r\nthe llama, certainly indicate the lapse of many centuries before such a\r\nchange could have been effected.\r\n\r\n[1146] [Cf. remarks of Daniel Wilson in his _Prehistoric Man_, i.\r\n243.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1147] The name is of later date. One story is that, when an Inca was\r\nencamped there, a messenger reached him with unusual celerity, whose\r\nspeed was compared with that of the “_huanaco_.” The Inca said, “_Tia_”\r\n(sit or rest), “_O! huanaco_.”\r\n\r\n[1148] Basadre’s measurement is 32 inches by 21.\r\n\r\n[1149] Quoted by Garcilasso de la Vega, Pte. I. lib. III. cap. 1.\r\n\r\n[1150] Basadre mentions a carved stone brought from the department\r\nof Ancachs, in Peru, which had some resemblances to the stones at\r\nTiahuanacu. A copy of it is in possession of Señor Raimondi.\r\n\r\n[1151] [Cf. plans and views in Squier’s _Peru_, ch. 24.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1152] Cap. 94.\r\n\r\n[1153] See page 238.\r\n\r\n[1154] The name of the place where these remains are situated is\r\nConcacha, from the Quichua word “_Cuncachay_,”—the act of holding down\r\na victim for sacrifice; literally, “to take by the neck.”\r\n\r\n[1155] The names of this god were _Con-Illa-Tici-Uira-cocha_, and he\r\nwas the _Pachayachachic_, or Teacher of the World. _Pacha_ is “time,”\r\nor “place;” also “the universe.” “_Yachachic_,” a teacher, from\r\n“_Yachachini_,” “I teach.” _Con_ is said to signify the creating Deity\r\n(_Betanzos, Garcia_). According to Gomara, Con was a creative deity who\r\ncame from the north, afterwards expelled by Pachacamac, and a modern\r\nauthority (Lopez, p. 235) suggests that _Con_ represented the “cult\r\nof the setting sun,” because _Cunti_ means the west. _Tici_ means a\r\nfounder or foundation, and _Illa_ is light, from _Illani_, “I shine:”\r\n“The Origin of Light” (_Montesinos. Anonymous Jesuit._ Lopez suggests\r\n“_Ati_,” an evil omen,—the Moon God); or, according to one authority,\r\n“Light Eternal” (_The anonymous Jesuit_). _Vira_ is a corruption of\r\n_Pirua_, which is said by some authorities to be the name of the\r\nfirst settler, or the founder of a dynasty; and by others to mean a\r\n“depository,” a “place of abode;” hence a “dweller,” or “abider.”\r\n_Cocha_ means “ocean,” “abyss,” “profundity,” “space.” _Uira-cocha_,\r\n“the Dweller in Space.” So that the whole would signify “God: the\r\nCreator of Light:” “the Dweller in Space: the Teacher of the World.”\r\n\r\nSome authors gave the meaning of _Uira-cocha_ to be “foam of the sea:”\r\nfrom _Uira_ (_Huira_), “grease,” or “foam,” and _Cocha_, “ocean,”\r\n“sea,” “lake.” Garcilasso de la Vega pointed out the error. In compound\r\nwords of a nominative and genitive, the genitive is invariably placed\r\nfirst in Quichua; so that the meaning would be “a sea of grease,” not\r\n“grease of the sea.” Hence he concludes that _Uira-cocha_ is not a\r\ncompound word, but simply a name, the derivation of which he does not\r\nattempt to explain. Blas Valera says that it means “the will and power\r\nof God;” not that this is the signification of the word, but that\r\nsuch were the godlike attributes of the being who was known by it.\r\nAcosta says that to _Ticsi Uira-cocha_ they assigned the chief power\r\nand command over all things. The anonymous Jesuit tells us that _Illa\r\nTicsi_ was the original name, and that _Uira-cocha_ was added later.\r\n\r\nOf these names, _Illa Ticci_ appears to have been the most ancient.\r\n\r\n[1156] Cieza de Leon and Salcamayhua.\r\n\r\n[1157] Montesinos calls the ancient people, who were peaceful and\r\nindustrious, _Hatu-runa_, or “Great men.” See also Matienza (MS. Brit.\r\nMus.).\r\n\r\n[1158] _The anonymous Jesuit_, p. 178. A work referred to by Oliva as\r\nhaving been written by Blas Valera also mentions some of the early\r\nkings by name. (See Saldamando, _Jesuitas del Peru_, p. 22.)\r\n\r\n[1159] _Cachi_ (“salt”) was the Inca’s instruction in rational life,\r\n_Uchu_ (“pepper”) was the delight the people derived from this\r\nteaching, and _Sauca_ (“joy”) means the happiness afterward experienced.\r\n\r\n[1160] G. de la Vega.\r\n\r\n[1161] Molina, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[1162] Pirua?\r\n\r\n[1163] Cieza de Leon; Herrera.\r\n\r\n[1164] Salcamayhua.\r\n\r\n[1165] Blas Valera allows a period of 600 years for the existence of\r\nthe Inca dynasty, which throws its origin back to the days of Alfred\r\nthe Great. Garcilasso allows 400 years, which would make its rise to be\r\ncontemporary with Henry II of England. But twelve generations, allowing\r\ntwenty-five years for each, would only occupy 300 years.\r\n\r\n[1166] Erroneously called _Aymaras_ by the Spaniards. The name, which\r\nreally belongs to a branch of the Quichua tribe, was first misapplied\r\nto the Colla language by the Jesuits at Juli, and afterwards to the\r\nwhole Colla race.\r\n\r\n[1167] Don Modesto Basadre tells us that he sent an Indian messenger,\r\nnamed Alejo Vilca, from Puno to Tacna, a distance of 84 leagues, who\r\ndid it in 62 hours, his only sustenance being a little dried maize and\r\ncoca,—over four miles an hour for 152 miles.\r\n\r\n[1168] Fray Ludovico Geronimo de Oré, a native of Guamanga, in Peru,\r\nwas the author of _Rituale seu Manuale ac brevem formam administrandi\r\nsacramenta juxta ordinem S. Ecclesiæ Romanœ, cum translationibus in\r\nlinguas provinciarum Peruanorum_, published at Naples in 1607.\r\n\r\n[1169] Cf. Note 1, following this chapter.\r\n\r\n[1170] _Chucu_ means a head-dress; _Huaman_, a falcon; _Huacra_, a horn.\r\n\r\n[1171] [Ramusio’s plan of Cuzco is given in Vol. II. p. 554, with\r\nreferences (p. 556) to other plans and descriptions; to which may be\r\nadded an archæological examination by Wiener, in the _Bull. de la\r\nSoc. de Géog. de Paris_, Oct., 1879, and in his _Pérou et Bolivie_,\r\nwith an enlarged plan of the town, showing the regions of different\r\narchitecture; accounts in Marcoy’s _Voyage à travers l’Amérique du Sud_\r\n(Paris, 1869; or Eng. transl. i. 174), and in Nadaillac’s _L’Amérique\r\npréhistorique_, and by Squier in his Peru, and in his _Remarques sur la\r\nGéographie du Pérou_, p. 20.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1172] It is related by Betanzos that one day this Inca appeared before\r\nhis people with a very joyful countenance. When they asked him the\r\ncause of his joy, he replied that Uira-cocha Pachayachachic had spoken\r\nto him in a dream that night. Then all the people rose up and saluted\r\nhim as Viracocha Inca, which is as much as to say,—“King and God.” From\r\nthat time he was so called. Garcilasso gives a different version of the\r\nsame tradition, in which he confuses Viracocha with his son.\r\n\r\n[1173] Cieza de Leon, ii. 138-44.\r\n\r\n[1174] Salcamayhua, 91.\r\n\r\n[1175] Blas Valera says 42, Balboa 33, years.\r\n\r\n[1176] [The ruins of Atahualpa’s palace are figured in Wiener’s _Pérou\r\net Bolivie_, and in Cte. de Gabriac’s _Promenade à travers l’Amérique\r\ndu Sud_ (Paris, 1868), p. 196.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1177] The meanings of the names of these Incas are significant. Manco\r\nand Rocca appear to be proper names without any clear etymology. The\r\nrest refer to mental attributes, or else to some personal peculiarity.\r\nSinchi means “strong.” Lloque is “left-handed.” Yupanqui is the second\r\nperson of the future tense of a verb, and signifies “you will count.”\r\nGarcilasso interprets it as one who will count as wise, virtuous, and\r\npowerful. Ccapac is rich; that is, rich in all virtues and attributes\r\nof a prince. Mayta is an adverb, “where;” and Salcamayhua says that\r\nthe constant cry and prayer of this Inca was, “Where art thou, O\r\nGod?” because he was constantly seeking his Creator. Yahuar-huaccac\r\nmeans “weeping blood,” probably in allusion to some malady from which\r\nhe suffered. Pachacutec has already been explained. Tupac is a word\r\nsignifying royal splendor, and Huayna means “youth.” Huascar is “a\r\nchain,” in allusion to a golden chain said to have been made in his\r\nhonor, and held by the dancers at the festival of his birth. The\r\nmeaning of Atahualpa has been much disputed. _Hualpa_ certainly means\r\nany large game fowl. _Hualpani_ is to create. _Atau_ is “chance,” or\r\n“the fortune of war.” Garcilasso, who is always opposed to derivations,\r\nmaintains that Atahualpa was a proper name without special meaning, and\r\nthat Hualpa, as a word for a fowl, is derived from it, because the boys\r\nin the streets, when imitating cock-crowing, used the word Atahualpa.\r\nBut Hualpa formed part of the name of many scions of the Inca family\r\nlong before the time of Atahualpa.\r\n\r\n[1178] All authorities agree that Manco Ccapac was the first Inca,\r\nalthough Montesinos places him far back at the head of the Pirhua\r\ndynasty, and all agree respecting the second, Sinchi Rocca. Lloque\r\nYupanqui, with various spellings, has the unanimous vote of all\r\nauthorities except Acosta, who calls him “Iaguarhuarque.” But Acosta’s\r\nlist is incomplete. Respecting Mayta Ccapac and Ccapac Yupanqui, all\r\nare agreed except Betanzos, who transposes them by an evident slip\r\nof memory. Touching Inca Rocca all are agreed, though Montesinos has\r\nSinchi for Inca, and all agree as to Yahuar-huaccac. It is true that\r\nCieza de Leon and Herrera call him Inca Yupanqui, but this is explained\r\nby Salcamayhua when he gives the full name,—Yahuar-huaccac Inca\r\nYupanqui. All agree as to Uira-cocha. As to his successor, Betanzos,\r\nCieza de Leon, Fernandez, Herrera, Salcamayhua, and Balboa mention\r\nthe short reign of the deposed Urco. Cieza de Leon and Betanzos give\r\nYupanqui as the name of Urco’s brother; all other authorities have\r\nPachacutec. The discrepancy is explained by his names having been\r\nYupanqui Pachacutec. This also accounts for Garcilasso de la Vega\r\nand Santillan having made Pachacutec and Yupanqui into two Incas,\r\nfather and son. Betanzos also interpolates a Yamque Yupanqui. All are\r\nagreed with regard to Tupac Inca Yupanqui, Huayna Ccapac, Huascar,\r\nand Atahualpa. [There is another comparison of the different lists in\r\nWiener, _L’Empire des Incas_, p. 53.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1179] [See an early cut of this sun-worship in Vol. II. p. 551.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1180] At Pachacamac there was a temple to the coast deity, called\r\nlocally Pachacamac, and another to the sun; but none to the supreme\r\nCreator, one of whose epithets was Pachacamac.\r\n\r\n[1181] Spanish authors mention a being called _Supay_, which they say\r\nwas the devil. _Supay_, as an evil spirit, also occurs in the drama of\r\nOllantay. It may have been some local _huaca_, but no devil as such,\r\nentered into the religious belief of the Incas.\r\n\r\n[1182] Acosta, Polo de Ondegardo, Garcilasso de la Vega.\r\n\r\n[1183] The mummies were those of Incas Uira-cocha, Tupac Yupanqui, and\r\nHuayna Ccapac; of Mama Runtu (wife of Uira-cocha) and Mama Ocllo (wife\r\nof Tupac Yupanqui).\r\n\r\n[1184] Mentioned by Calancha (471) and Arriaga as an oracle at the\r\nvillage of Tauca, in Conchucos. Brinton has built up a myth which he\r\ncredits to the whole Peruvian people, on the strength of a meaning\r\napplied to the word _Catequilla_, which is erroneous. It is exactly the\r\nsame grammatical error that those etymologists fell into who thought\r\nthat _Uira-cocha_ signified “foam of the sea.” (_Myths of the New\r\nWorld_, 154.)\r\n\r\n[1185] A very interesting account of it, with a sketch, is given by\r\nSquier, p. 524.\r\n\r\n[1186] _Huatana_ means a halter, from _huatani_, to seize; hence the\r\ntying up or encircling of the sun.\r\n\r\n[1187] Authorities differ respecting the names of the months, and\r\nprobably some months had more than one name. But the most accurate\r\nlist, and that which is most in agreement with all the others, is the\r\none adopted by the first Council of Lima, and given by Calancha. It is\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n1. _Yntip Raymi_ (22 June-22 July), Festival of the Winter Solstice, or\r\n_Raymi_.\r\n\r\n2. Chahuarquiz (22 July-22 Aug.), Season of ploughing.\r\n\r\n3. Yapa-quiz (22 Aug.-22 Sept.), Season of sowing.\r\n\r\n4. _Ccoya Raymi_ (22 Sept.-22 Oct.), Festival of the Spring Equinox.\r\n_Situa._\r\n\r\n5.

Camay (22 Jan.-22 Feb.), Season of exercises.\r\n\r\n9. Hatun-poccoy (22 Feb.-22 March), Season of ripening.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n10. _Pacha-poccoy_ (22 March-22 April), Festival of Autumn Equinox.\r\n_Mosoc Nina._\r\n\r\n11. Ayrihua (22 April-22 May), Beginning of harvest.\r\n\r\n12. Aymuray (22 May-22 June), Harvesting month. in Google’s copy\r\n\r\n[1188] Judges xii. 39; 2 Kings iii. 27.\r\n\r\n[1189] The sacrifices were called _runa_, _yuyac_, and _huahua_. The\r\nSpaniards thought that _runa_ and _yuyac_ signified men, and _huahua_\r\nchildren. This was not the case when speaking of sacrificial victims.\r\n_Runa_ was applied to a male sacrifice, _huahua_ to the lambs, and\r\n_yuyac_ signified an adult or full-grown animal. The sacrificial\r\nanimals were also called after the names of those who offered them,\r\nwhich was another cause of erroneous assumptions by Spanish writers.\r\nThere was a law strictly prohibiting human sacrifices among the\r\nconquered tribes; and the statement that servants were sacrificed at\r\nthe obsequies of their masters is disproved by the fact, mentioned by\r\nthe anonymous Jesuit, that in none of the burial-places opened by the\r\nSpaniards in search of treasure were any human bones found, except\r\nthose of the buried lord himself.\r\n\r\n[1190] Prescott (I. p. 98, note) accepted the statement that human\r\nsacrifices were offered by the Incas, because six authorities,\r\nSarmiento, Cieza de Leon, Montesinos, Balboa, Ondegardo, and\r\nAcosta—outnumbered the single authority on the other side, Garcilasso\r\nde la Vega, who, moreover, was believed to be prejudiced owing to his\r\nrelationship to the Incas. Sarmiento and Cieza de Leon are one and the\r\nsame, so that the number of authorities for human sacrifices is reduced\r\nto five. Cieza de Leon, Montesinos, and Balboa adopted the belief that\r\nhuman sacrifices were offered up, through a misunderstanding of the\r\nwords _yuyac_ and _huahua_. Acosta had little or no acquaintance with\r\nthe language, as is proved by the numerous linguistic blunders in his\r\nwork. Ondegardo wrote at a time when he scarcely knew the language, and\r\nhad no interpreters; for it was in 1554, when he was judge at Cuzco.\r\nAt that time all the annalists and old men had fled into the forests,\r\nbecause of the insurrection of Francisco Hernandez Giron.\r\n\r\nThe authorities who deny the practice are numerous and important. These\r\nare Francisco de Chaves, one of the best and most able of the original\r\nconquerors; Juan de Oliva; the Licentiate Alvarez; Fray Marcos Jofre;\r\nthe Licentiate Falcon, in his _Apologia pro Indis_; Melchior Hernandez,\r\nin his dictionary, under the words _harpay_ and _huahua_; the anonymous\r\nJesuit in his most valuable narrative; and Garcilasso de la Vega. These\r\neight authorities outweigh the five quoted by Prescott, both as regards\r\nnumber and importance. So that the evidence against human sacrifices is\r\nconclusive. The _Quipus_, as the anonymous Jesuit tells us, also prove\r\nthat there was a law prohibiting human sacrifices.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that 200 children and 1,000 men were sacrificed at the\r\ncoronation of Huayua Ccapac was made; but these “_huahuas_” were not\r\nchildren of men, but young lambs, which are called children; and the\r\n“_yuyac_” and “_runa_” were not men, but adult llamas. [Mr. Markham has\r\nelsewhere collated the authorities on this point (_Royal Commentaries_,\r\ni. 139). Cf. Bollaert’s _Antiq. Researches_, p. 124; and Alphonse\r\nCastaing on “Les Fêtes, Offrandes et Sacrifices dans l’Antiquité\r\nPeruvienne,” in the _Archives de la Société Américaine de France_, n.\r\ns. iii. 239.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1191] The sacrificial llamas bore the names of the youths who\r\npresented them. Hence the Spanish writers, with little or no knowledge\r\nof the language, assumed that the youths themselves were the victims.\r\n(See _ante_, p. 237.)\r\n\r\n[1192] _Ñusta_, princess; _calli_, valorous; _sapa_, alone, unrivalled.\r\n\r\n[1193] Of the first class were the _Tarpuntay_, or sacrificing priests,\r\nand the _Nacac_, who cut up the victims and provided the offerings,\r\nwhether _harpay_ or bloody sacrifices, _haspay_ or bloodless sacrifices\r\nof flesh, or _cocuy_, oblations of corn, fruit, or coca. Molina\r\nmentions a custom called _Ccapac-cocha_ or _Cacha-huaca_, being the\r\ndistribution of sacrifices. An enormous tribute came to Cuzco annually\r\nfor sacrificial purposes, and was thence distributed by the Inca, for\r\nthe worship of every huaca in the empire. The different sacrifices\r\nwere sent from Cuzco in all directions for delivery to the priests of\r\nthe numerous _huacas_. The ministering priests were called _Huacap\r\nUillac_ when they had charge of a special idol, _Huacap Rimachi_ or\r\n_Huatuc_ when they received utterances from a deity while in a state of\r\necstatic frenzy called _utirayay_, and _Ychurichuc_ when they received\r\nconfessions and ministered in private families. The soothsayers were a\r\nvery numerous class. The _Hamurpa_ examined the entrails of sacrifices,\r\nand divined by the flight of birds. The _Llayca_, _Achacuc_, _Huatuc_,\r\nand _Uira-piricuc_ were soothsayers of various grades. The _Socyac_\r\ndivined by maize heaps, the _Pacchacuc_ by the feet of a large hairy\r\nspider, the _Llaychunca_ by odds and evens. The recluses were not only\r\n_Aclla-cuna_, or virgins congregated in temples under the charge of\r\nmatrons called _Mama-cuna_. There were also hermits who meditated in\r\nsolitary places, and appear to have been under a rule, with an abbot\r\ncalled _Tucricac_, and younger men serving a novitiate called _Huamac_.\r\nThese _Huancaquilli_, or hermits, took vows of chastity (_titu_),\r\nobedience (_Huñicui_), poverty (_uscacuy_), and penance (_villullery_).\r\n\r\n[1194] [The general works on the Inca civilization necessarily touch\r\nthese points of their religious customs, and Mr. Markham’s volume on\r\nthe _Rites and Laws of the Incas_ is a prime source of information.\r\nHawk’s translation of Rivero and Von Tschudi (p. 151) gives references;\r\nbut special mention may be made of Müller’s _Geschichte der\r\nAmerikanischen Urreligionen_; Castaing’s _Les Système religieux dans\r\nl’Antiquité peruvienne_, in the _Archives de la Soc.

The dialects only differ slightly, and\r\neven the language of the Collas, called by the Spaniards Aymara, is\r\nidentical as regards the grammatical structure, while a clear majority\r\nof the words are the same. The general language of Peru belongs to that\r\nAmerican group of languages which has been called agglutinative by\r\nWilliam von Humboldt. These languages form new words by a process of\r\njunction which is much more developed in them than in any of the forms\r\nof speech in the Old World. They also have exclusive and inclusive\r\nplurals, and transitional forms of the verb combined with pronominal\r\nsuffixes which are peculiar to them. In these respects the Quichua\r\nis purely an American language, and in spite of the resemblances in\r\nthe sounds of some words, which have been diligently collected by\r\nLopez (_Les Races Aryennes du Pérou_, par Vicente F. Lopez, Paris,\r\n1871) and Ellis (_Peruvia Scythica_, by Robert Ellis, B. D., London,\r\n1875), no connection, either as regards grammar or vocabulary, has\r\nbeen satisfactorily established between the speech of the Incas and\r\nany language of the Old World. Quichua is a noble language, with\r\na most extensive vocabulary, rich in forms of the plural number,\r\nwhich argue a very clear conception of the idea of plurality; rich\r\nin verbal conjugations; rich in the power of forming compound nouns;\r\nrich in varied expression to denote abstract ideas; rich in words for\r\nrelationships which are wanting in the Old World idioms; and rich,\r\nabove all, in synonyms: so that it was an efficient vehicle wherewith\r\nto clothe the thoughts and ideas of a people advanced in civilization.\r\n\r\n[1196] Garcilasso, _Com.

They\r\nalso had a stringed instrument called _tinya_, for accompanying their\r\nsongs, a drum, and trumpets of several kinds, one made from a sea-shell.\r\n\r\n[1198] Blas Valera wrote upon the subject of Inca drugs, and I have\r\ngiven a list of those usually found in the bags of the itinerant\r\nCalahuaya doctors, in a foot-note at page 186 in vol. i. of my\r\ntranslation of the first part of the _Royal Commentaries_ of Garcilasso\r\nde la Vega. An interesting account of the Calahuaya doctors is given by\r\nDon Modesto Basadre in his _Riquezas Peruanas_, p. 17 (Lima, 1884).\r\n\r\n[1199] In the church of Santa Anna.\r\n\r\n[1200] [See pictures of Atahualpa in Vol. II. pp. 515, 516.

A golden breastplate\r\nand _topu_, a golden leaf with a long stalk, four specimens of golden\r\nfruit, and a girdle of gold were found near Cuzco in 1852, and sent to\r\nthe late General Echenique, then President of Peru. The present writer\r\nhad an opportunity of inspecting and making careful copies of them. His\r\ndrawings of the breastplate and _topu_ were lithographed for Bollaert’s\r\n_Antiquarian Researches in Peru_, p. 146. The breastplate was 5-3/10\r\ninches in diameter, and had four narrow slits for suspending it round\r\nthe neck. The golden leaf was 12-7/10 inches long, including the stem;\r\nbreadth of the base of the leaf, 3-1/10 inches. The models of fruit\r\nwere 3 inches in diameter, and the girdle 18¼ inches long.\r\n\r\n[1202] “The stones are of various sizes in different structures,\r\nranging in length from one to eight feet, and in thickness from six\r\ninches to two feet. The larger stones are generally at the bottom,\r\neach course diminishing in thickness towards the top of the wall,\r\nthus giving a very pleasing effect of graduation. The joints are of a\r\nprecision unknown in our architecture, and not rivalled in the remains\r\nof ancient art in Europe. The statement of the old writers, that the\r\naccuracy with which the stones of some structures were fitted together\r\nwas such that it was impossible to introduce the thinnest knife-blade\r\nor finest needle between them, may be taken as strictly true. The world\r\nhas nothing to show in the way of stone cutting and fitting to surpass\r\nthe skill and accuracy displayed in the Inca structures of Cuzco.”\r\n\r\n[1203] Place of serpents.\r\n\r\n[1204] An unmarried prince of the blood royal; a nobleman.

Age 50 to 60.\r\n\r\n10. _Puñuc ruccu_, “Dotage.” No work. Sixty and upwards.\r\n\r\nA _Chunca_ consisted of ten _Purics_, with the other classes in\r\nproportion. The _Puric_ was married to one wife, and, while assisted\r\nby the young lads and the elderly men, he supported the children and\r\nthe old people who could not work. The Peruvian laborer had many\r\nsuperstitions, but he was not devoid of higher religious feelings.\r\nThis is shown by his practice when travelling. On reaching the summit\r\nof a pass he never forgot to throw a stone, or sometimes his beloved\r\npellet of coca, on a heap by the roadside, as a thank-offering to\r\nGod, exclaiming, _Apachicta muchani!_ “I worship or give thanks at\r\nthis heap.” Festivals lightened his days of toil by their periodical\r\nrecurrence, and certain family ceremonials were also recognized as\r\noccasions for holidays. There was a gathering at the cradling of a\r\nchild, called _quirau_. When the child attained the age of one year,\r\nthe _rutuchicu_ took place. Then he received the name he was to retain\r\nuntil he attained the age of puberty. The child was closely shorn, and\r\nthe name was given by the eldest relation. With a girl the ceremony was\r\ncalled _quicuchica_, and there was a fast of two days imposed before\r\nthe naming-day, when she assumed the dress called _aucalluasu_.\r\n\r\n[1213] The _tupu_ was a measure of land sufficient to support one\r\nman and his wife. It was the unit of land measurement, and a _puric_\r\nreceived _tupus_ according to the number of those dependent on him. In\r\nparts of Peru, especially on the road from Tarma to Xauxa, these small\r\nsquare fields, or _tupus_, may still be seen in great numbers, divided\r\nby low stone walls.\r\n\r\n[1214] The shares for the _Inca_ and _Huaca_ varied according to the\r\nrequirements of the state. If needful, the _Inca_ share was increased\r\nat the expense of the _Huaca_, but never at the expense of the people’s\r\nshare.\r\n\r\n[1215] From _Taripani_, I examine.\r\n\r\n[1216] It should probably be _Apunaca_: _Apu_ is a chief, and _naca_\r\nthe plural suffix in the Colla dialect.\r\n\r\n[1217] _Hatun_, great, and _uilca_, sacred. This official held a\r\nposition equivalent to a Christian bishop.\r\n\r\n[1218] [On the use of guano see Markham’s _Cieza de Leon_, p. 266,\r\nnote.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1219] [Max Steffen, in his _Die Landwirtschaft bei den\r\nAltamerikanischen Kulturvölkern_ (Leipzig, 1883), gives a list of\r\nsources.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1220] [The llamas were used in ploughing.

But the _Relacion de la tierra que\r\ndescubrió Don Francisco Pizarro_, by Diego de Truxillo, remained in\r\nmanuscript and is lost to us. Francisco de Chaves, one of the most\r\nrespected of the companions of Pizarro, who strove to save the life\r\nof Atahualpa, and was an intimate friend of the Inca’s brother, was\r\nalso an author. Chaves is honorably distinguished for his moderation\r\nand humanity. He lost his own life in defending the staircase against\r\nthe assassins of Pizarro. He left behind a copious narrative, and his\r\nintimate relations with the Indians make it likely that it contained\r\nmuch valuable information respecting Inca civilization. It was\r\ninherited by the author’s friend and relation, Luis Valera, but it was\r\nnever printed, and the manuscript is now lost. The works of Palomino,\r\na companion of Belalcazar, who wrote on the kingdom of Quito, are also\r\nlost, with the exception of a fragment preserved in the _Breve Informe_\r\nof Las Casas.

See also an introductory notice in Markham’s\r\nedition (1880).\r\n\r\n[1245] Thus his lists of the Incas, of the names of months and of\r\nfestivals, are very defective; and his list of names of stars, though\r\ncopied from Balboa without acknowledgment, is incomplete.\r\n\r\n[1246] Acosta was the chief source whence the civilized world of\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, beyond the limits of\r\nSpain, derived a knowledge of Peruvian civilization. Purchas, in his\r\n_Pilgrimage_ (ed. of 1623, lib. v. p. 869; vi. p. 931), quotes largely\r\nfrom the learned Jesuit, and an abstract of his work is given in\r\nHarris’s _Voyages_ (lib. i. cap. xiii. pp. 751-799). He is much relied\r\nupon as an authority by Robertson, and is quoted 19 times in Prescott’s\r\n_Conquest of Peru_, thus taking the fourth place as an authority with\r\nregard to that work, since Garcilasso is quoted 89 times, Cieza de Leon\r\n45, Ondegardo 41, Acosta 19.\r\n\r\n[1247] Of whose parentage a pleasing story is told.

At last he became\r\nBishop of Truxillo in 1620, and when he heard the chimes which were\r\nrung on his approach to the city, he said, “That bell which excels all\r\nthe others was founded by my father.” (“Aquella campana que sobresale\r\nentre las demas le fundio mi padre.”)\r\n\r\n[1248] _Papeles Varios de Indias._ MS.

(Madrid, 1882).\r\n\r\n[1270] We first hear of Sarmiento in a memorial dated at Cuzco on\r\nMarch 4, 1572, in which he says that he was the author of a history\r\nof the Incas, now lost. We further gather that, owing to having found\r\nout from the records of the Incas that Tupac Inca Yupanqui discovered\r\ntwo islands in the South Sea, called _Ahuachumpi_ and _Ninachumpi_,\r\nSarmiento sailed on an expedition to discover them at some time\r\nprevious to 1564. Balboa also mentions the tradition of the discovery\r\nof these islands by Tupac Yupanqui. Sarmiento seems to have discovered\r\nislands which he believed to be those of the Inca, and in 1567 he\r\nvolunteered to command the expedition dispatched by Lope de Castro,\r\nthen governor of Peru, to discover the Terra Australis. But Castro gave\r\nthe command to his own relation, Mandana. We learn, however, from the\r\nmemorial of Sarmiento, that he accompanied the expedition, and that the\r\nfirst land was discovered through shaping a course in accordance with\r\nhis advice. Sarmiento submitted a full report of this first voyage of\r\nMandana, which is now lost, to the Viceroy Toledo. In 1579, Sarmiento\r\nwas sent to explore the Straits of Magellan. In 1586, on his way to\r\nSpain, he was captured by an English ship belonging to Raleigh, and\r\nwas entertained hospitably by Sir Walter at Durham House until his\r\nransom was collected. From the Spanish captive his host obtained much\r\ninformation respecting Peru and its Incas. He could have no higher\r\nauthority. One of the journals of the survey of Magellan Straits by\r\nSarmiento was published at Madrid in 1768: _Viage al estrecho de\r\nMagellanes: por el Capitan Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, en los años 1579\r\ny 1580_.

But when,\r\nabout ten or twelve years after, my business led me among them,” he\r\nwas recognized by the name, and it served him in good stead. (_Hist.\r\nof Five Nats._, 3d ed., i. p. 11.) The savages always took the liberty\r\nof assigning names of their own, either general or individual, to the\r\nEuropeans with whom they had intercourse. The governor of Canada,\r\nfor the time being, was called “Onontio”; of New York, “Corlear”; of\r\nVirginia, “Assarigoa”; of Pennsylvania, “Onas,” etc. At a council of\r\nthe Six Nations with the governors of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and\r\nMaryland, held at Lancaster in June, 1744, it came under notice that\r\nthe governor of Maryland had as yet no appellation assigned him by\r\nthe natives. Much formality was used in providing one for him. It was\r\ntried by lot as to which of the tribes should have the honor of naming\r\nhim. The lot fell to the Cayugas, one of whose chiefs, after solemn\r\ndeliberation, assigned the name “To-carryhogan.” (Colden, ii. p. 89.)\r\n\r\n[1343] From Archives of Massachusetts, vol. lxviii. p. 193:—\r\n\r\n“For the Indian Sagamores, and people that are in warre against us.\r\n\r\n“Inteligence is Come to us that you haue some English (especially\r\nweomen and children) in Captivity among you.

He came with his family from Germany in 1710, and settled at\r\nSchoharie, N. Y. His ability and integrity won him the confidence alike\r\nof the Indians and the English. In the _Collections of the Historical\r\nSociety of Pennsylvania_, vol. i. pp. 1-34, are autobiographical,\r\npersonal, and narrative papers and journals by this remarkable man,\r\nequally characterized by the boldest spirit of adventure and by an\r\nardent piety. He gives in full his journal of his mission from the\r\ngovernments of Pennsylvania and Virginia to negotiate with the Six\r\nNations in 1737.

[See Vol.\r\nV. 571.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1353] The excellent James Logan, who came over as secretary to William\r\nPenn, and who always claimed to be a consistent member of the Society\r\nof Friends, took an exception to a position on one point,—that of\r\nmaintaining the right, and even obligation, of defensive warfare. A\r\nletter of very cogent argument to this effect was addressed by him\r\nto the Society of Friends in 1741, remonstrating with them for their\r\nopposition in the legislature to means for defending the colony.\r\n_Collections of Historl.

The occasion of this dispersion and severe watch over\r\nthe Indian converts was a jealousy that they had been warmed in the\r\nbosom of a weak pity merely for a deadly use of their fangs.\r\n\r\n[1355] [See Vol. V. 240.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1356] _Spotswood Papers_, published by the Virginia Historical\r\nSociety.

It was estimated that the Indian trade of New York\r\nincreased fivefold in twelve years.\r\n\r\n[1358] [See Vol. V. 530, 575.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1359] Appendix V to the _Ohio Valley Historical Series_, edition of\r\n_Bouquet’s Expedition_ (Cincinnati, 1868).\r\n\r\n[1360] It is estimated that not less than two hundred of these\r\nscattered traders, who had confidently ventured into the wilderness on\r\nthe assurance of the treaty, were massacred, after being plundered of\r\ngoods of more than a hundred thousand pounds in value.\r\n\r\n[1361] [The events of the Pontiac war can be followed in Vol. V.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[1362] The bibliography of the subject is nowhere exhaustively done.\r\nThe _Proof-sheets_ of Pilling as a tentative effort, and his later\r\ndivisionary sections, devoted to the Eskimo, Siouan, and other\r\nstocks, though primarily framed for their linguistic bearing, are\r\nthe chief help; and these guides can be supplemented by Field’s\r\nIndian _Bibliography_, the references for anonymous books in Sabin’s\r\n_Dictionary_ (ix. p. 86), and sections in many catalogues of public and\r\nprivate libraries, like the Brinley (iii. 5, 352 etc.), devoted wholly\r\nor in part to Americana, and the foot-notes and authorities given in\r\nParkman, H. H. Bancroft, and many others.\r\n\r\n[1363] Parkman’s merits as a historian are elsewhere recognized in\r\nthe present history. See Vols. II., IV., and V. He first gave his\r\nsummary of Indian character in the introductory chapter of his first\r\nhistorical book, his _Pontiac_. He later completed it in papers in the\r\n_North Amer. Rev._, July, 1865, and July, 1866, and finally in the\r\nintroduction to his _Jesuits_.\r\n\r\n[1364] This class of material, including the _Lettres Edifiantes_,\r\nhas been examined in our Vol. IV. 292, 296, 316, etc. Cf. Shea’s\r\n_Charlevoix_, i. 88; _Glorias del segundo siglo de la compañia de\r\nJesus, 1646-1730_ (Madrid, 1734).\r\n\r\nParkman calls Brébœuf the best observer among the Jesuits. On their\r\nmissions see _Revue Canadienne_, Jan., 1888; _Dublin Review_, xii.\r\n(1869) 70; _Mag. Amer. Hist._, iii. 250. Margry (vol. i.) has a\r\n“Mémoire” on the Recollects, 1614-1884.

Probably Mr. Samuel G. Drake was for many years\r\nthe most assiduous promoter of this class of books.

See Vol. V. p. 581.\r\n\r\n[1386] The question has often been discussed as to the origin of the\r\ntitle of “Indian summer,” as applied to a beautiful portion of our\r\nautumnal season. Dr. Doddridge gives us an explanation of its original\r\nsignificance, or, at least, of an association with it, which would make\r\na feeling of dread rather than of romance its most striking suggestion.\r\nHe says that to a backwoodsman the term in its original import would\r\ncause a chill of horror. The explanation is as follows: The white\r\nsettlers on the frontiers found no peace from Indian alarms and onsets\r\nsave in the winter. From spring to the early part of the autumn, the\r\nsettlers, cooped up in the forts, or ever at watch in their fields, had\r\nno security or comfort. The approach of winter was hailed as a jubilee\r\nin cabin and farm, with bustle and hilarity. But after the first set-in\r\nof winter aspects came a longer or shorter interval of warm, smoky,\r\nhazy weather, which would tempt the Indians—as if a brief return of\r\nsummer—to renew their incursions on the frontiers. The season, then,\r\nwas an “Indian summer” only for blood and mischief. So the spell of\r\nwarm open weather, of melting snows, in the latter part of February—a\r\npremature spring—was a period of dread for the frontiersmen. It was\r\ncalled the “pawwawing days,” as the Indians were then holding their\r\nincantations and councils for rehearsing for their spring war-parties.\r\n\r\n[1387] Cf. further on Hildreth and his books our Vol. VII. p. 536.\r\n\r\n[1388] There are notices of other books of this kind in Vols. V. and\r\nVII. of the present History. Particularly, may be mentioned Joseph\r\nPritt’s _Mirror of Olden Time_ (Chambersburg, Va., 1848; 2d ed.,\r\nAbingdon, Va., 1849), in which the most interesting portions are the\r\npersonal narratives of such captives to the Indians as Col. James\r\nSmith, John M’Cullough, and others, the full credibility of which is\r\nvouched for by those who knew them as neighbors and associates. This\r\nclass of narratives by men who for years, willingly or unwillingly,\r\naffiliated with their wild captors make very intelligible to us the\r\nfact that the whites are much more readily Indianized than are Indians\r\nled to conform to the ways of civilization. Cf. Archibald Loudon’s\r\n_Selection of some of the most interesting narratives, of outrages,\r\ncommitted by the Indians, in their wars with the white people. Also,\r\nan account of their manners, customs, traditions, etc._ (Carlisle,\r\n1808-11; Harrisburg, 1888).\r\n\r\n[1389] Vol. VII. p. 448. As types of successive ranges of\r\nanthropological studies see Happel’s _Thesaurus Exoticorum_ (Hamburg,\r\n1688); Stuart and Kuyper’s _De Mensch zoo als hij voorkomt_ (Amsterdam,\r\n1802), vol. vi., and the better known _Researches_ of Prichard (vol.\r\nv.).\r\n\r\n[1390] See Vol. V. 68.\r\n\r\n[1391] See Vol. VII. 264.\r\n\r\n[1392] The original paintings for the plates are now in the Peabody\r\nMuseum (_Report_, xvi. 189). M’Kenney also published his _Memoirs,\r\nofficial and personal, with sketches of travel among the northern and\r\nsouthern Indians_ (N. Y., 1846), in two volumes. He had been in 1816\r\nthe agent of the United States in dealing with the Indians, and in 1824\r\nhad been put at the head of the Indian bureau.\r\n\r\n[1393] The English editions are generally called _Illustrations of the\r\nManners_, etc.\r\n\r\n[1394] The best bibliographical record of Catlin’s publications is in\r\nPilling’s _Bibliog. Siouan languages_ (1887), p. 15. Cf. Field, p. 63;\r\nSabin, iii. p. 436.\r\n\r\n[1395] The volume contains three interesting portraits of Catlin and\r\nreimpressions of his drawings as originally published.\r\n\r\n[1396] For diversity of opinions respecting it see Allibone’s\r\n_Dictionary_. The modern scientific historian and ethnologist think\r\nin conjunction in giving it a low rank compared with what such a\r\nbook should be. The fullest account of the bibliography of this\r\nand of Schoolcraft’s other books is in Pilling’s _Proof-sheets_.\r\nWhatever credit may accrue to Schoolcraft is kept out of sight in the\r\ntitle-page of a condensation of the book, which has some interspersed\r\nadditions from other sources, all of which are obscurely included,\r\nso that the authorship of them is uncertain. The book is called _The\r\nIndian Tribes of the United States, edited by F. S. Drake_ (Philad.,\r\n1884), in 2 vols. There is another conglomerate and useful book,\r\nedited by W. W. Beach, _The Indian Miscellany; papers on the history,\r\nantiquities [etc.] of the American aborigines_ (Albany, 1877), which\r\nis a collection of magazine, review, and newspaper articles by various\r\nwriters, usually of good character.\r\n\r\n[1397] Particularly in Vol. IV.\r\n\r\n[1398] Cf. Vol. VI. 610, 611, 650.\r\n\r\n[1399] A part of it is reproduced by J. Watts de Peyster in his\r\n_Miscellanies by an Officer_, part ii. (N.

Shea says the only copies known of the 1727\r\nedition are those noted in the catalogues of H. C. Murphy, Menzies,\r\nBrinley, and T. H. Morrell. Stevens noted a copy in 1885, at £42. The\r\n_Murphy Catalogue_ gives the various editions. Cf. Sabin and Pilling.\r\nThere is an account of Colden in the _Hist. Mag._, Jan., 1865. Palfrey\r\n(_New England_, iv. 40) warns the student that Colden must be used with\r\ncaution, and that he needs to be corrected by Charlevoix.\r\n\r\n[1434] See Vol. V. 618.\r\n\r\n[1435] Cf. Vol. IV. 297. Schoolcraft later included in his _Indian\r\nTribes_ a reprint of David Cusick’s _Ancient Hist. of the Six Nations_\r\n(1825), the work of a Tuscarora chief. Brinton (_Myths_, 108) calls it\r\nof little value. Elias Johnson, another Tuscarora, printed a little\r\n_Hist. of the Six Nations_ at Lockport in 1881.\r\n\r\n[1436] See Vol. V., VI., VII.\r\n\r\n[1437] This was the earliest of Morgan’s important writings on the\r\nIroquois, but the full outcome of all his views on the Indian character\r\nand life can only be studied by following him through his later\r\n_Ancient Society_, his _Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity_, and\r\nhis _Houses and House-life of the American Aborigines_. Cf. Pilling’s\r\n_Proof-sheets_ for a conspectus of his works. Morgan’s early studies on\r\nthe Iroquois sensibly affected his judgment in his later treatment of\r\nall other North American tribes.\r\n\r\n[1438] Hale has also contributed to the _Mag. Amer. Hist._, 1885, xiii.\r\n131, a paper on “Chief George H. M. Johnson, his life and work among\r\nthe Six Nations;” and to the _Amer. Antiquarian_, 1885, vii. 7, one on\r\n“The Iroquois sacrifice of the white dog.”\r\n\r\nA few other references on the Iroquois follow: Drake’s _Book of the\r\nIndians_, book v.; D. Sherman in _Mag. West. Hist._, i. 467; W. W.\r\nBeauchamp in _Amer. Antiquarian_ (Nov., 1886), viii. 358; D. Gray on\r\nthe last Indian council in the Genesee Country, in _Scribner’s Mag._,\r\nxxv. 338; _Penna.

Ruttenber’s\r\n_Indian Tribes of the Hudson River_ (Albany, 1872) is an important\r\nbook. Miss Fletcher’s _Report_ includes a paper on the N. Y. Indians,\r\nby F. B. Hough.\r\n\r\n[1439] _N. Jersey Hist. Soc. Proc._, vol. iv.\r\n\r\n[1440] There is a sketch of this singular character in Brinton’s\r\n_Lenape_, ch. 7.\r\n\r\n[1441] Also _Amer. Whig Review_, Feb., 1849; and in Beach’s _Indian\r\nMiscellany_.\r\n\r\n[1442] We may also note: D. B. Brunner’s _Indians of Berks county,\r\nPa.; being a summary of all the tangible records of the aborigines of\r\nBerks County_ (Reading, Pa., 1881), and W. J. Buck’s “Lappawinzo and\r\nTishcohan chiefs of the Lenni Lenape” in the _Penna. Mag. of Hist._,\r\nJuly, 1883, p. 215. The early writers to elucidate the condition of\r\nthe Delawares soon after the white contact are Vanderdonck, Campanius,\r\nGabriel Thomas, and later there is something of value in Peter Kalm’s\r\n_Travels_. The early authorities on Pennsylvania need also to be\r\nconsulted, as well as the _Penna. Archives_, and the _Collections_\r\nof the Penna. Hist. Soc., and its _Bulletin_, whose first number has\r\nEttwein’s _Traditions and language of the Indians_. Of considerable\r\nhistorical value is Charles Thomson’s _Enquiry_ (see Vol. V. 575), and\r\nthe relations of the Quakers to the tribes are surveyed in an _Account\r\nof the Conduct of the Society of Friends towards the Indian Tribes_\r\n(Lond., 1844); but other references will be found _post_, Vol. V. 582,\r\nincluding others on the Moravian missions, the literature of which is\r\nof much importance in this study.

Other examples of implements of like shape, found on\r\nthe surface in places where there has been no glacial drift, may be\r\npalæolithic, but their form is no sufficient proof of this, since they\r\nmay equally well have been the work of the Indians, who are known to\r\nhave fashioned similar objects.\r\n\r\n[1482] _The Great Ice Age and its relation to the antiquity of Man_, by\r\nJames Geikie, p. 416.\r\n\r\n[1483] _An Inventory of our Glacial Drift_, by T.

The _Defenses_ was printed\r\nalso at Berlin in 1770. These were all included in De Pauw’s _Œuvres\r\nPhilosophiques_, published at Paris “_an iii_.” An English translation\r\nby J. Thomson was printed at London, 1795. Daniel Webb published some\r\nselections in English at Bath, 1789, 1795, and at Rochdale, 1806.\r\nPernetty’s _Examen_ was printed at Berlin in 1769. There is another\r\nlittle tractate of this time attributed to Pernetty, _De l’Amérique et\r\ndes Américains_ (Berlin, 1771), in whose humor De Pauw fares no better;\r\nbut Rich has a note on the questionable attributing of it to Pernetty,\r\nand its real author was probably C. de Bonneville (cf. Hœfer).\r\n\r\n[1576] _Delle Lettere Americane_ (_opere_, xi.-xiv., Milano, 1784-94);\r\nbetter known in J. B. L.

Clavigero, in 1780, believed that the distinct\r\nlinguistic traits of the Americans pointed to something like an\r\nindependent origin. Cf. W. D.

He found the long heads to predominate,\r\nexcept in Peru. Meigs had earlier studied the subject in his\r\n_Observations on the Form of the Occiput_ (Philad., 1860). Cf. Busk in\r\n_Jour. Anthrop. Inst._, April, 1873; Wyman, in _Peab. Mus. Rept._, 1871.\r\n\r\n[1606] H. H. Bancroft, _Nat. Races_, v. 129, 131, gives references\r\non the autochthonous theory. It is held by Nadaillac, _Les premiers\r\nhommes_, ii. 117; Fred. von Hellwald in _Smithsonian Rept._, 1866;\r\nBollaert’s “Contribution to an Introduction to the Anthropology of the\r\nNew World” in _Memoirs, Anthrop. Society of London_, ii. 92; F. Müller,\r\n_Allgemeine Ethnographie_; and Simonin, _L’homme Américain_ (Paris,\r\n1870). F. W. Putnam (_Report_ in _Wheeler’s Survey_, vii. p. 18) says:\r\n“The primitive race of America was as likely autochthonous and of\r\nPliocene age as of Asiatic origin.” The autochthonous view is probably\r\nlosing ground. Dall, in ch. 10, appended to the English translation of\r\nNadaillac’s _Prehistoric America_, sums up the prevailing arguments\r\nagainst it. Cf. also Dabry de Thiersant’s _Origine des Indiens du\r\nNouveau Monde_, ch. 1.\r\n\r\n[1607] Cf. also Prescott’s _Essays_, 224.\r\n\r\n[1608] This view has necessarily been abandoned in his later editions.\r\nCf. orig. ed., iii. 307; and final revision, ii. 130.\r\n\r\n[1609] Haven at the end of his second chapter tries to place\r\nSchoolcraft, and he does better than one would expect, at that day. For\r\nSchoolcraft’s special notes on Antiquities see his vol. i. p. 44; ii.\r\n83; iii. 73; iv. 113; v. 85, 657. For bibliography see Pilling, Sabin,\r\nField, etc.\r\n\r\n[1610] Again he says: “Man may be assumed to be prehistoric wherever\r\nhis chroniclings of himself are undesigned, and his history is\r\nwholly recoverable by induction. The term has, strictly speaking,\r\nno chronological significance; but in its relative application\r\ncorresponds to other archæological, in contradistinction to geological\r\nperiods.” Of America he says: “A continent where man may be studied\r\nunder circumstances which seem to furnish the best guarantee of his\r\nindependent development.” Dawkins (_Cave hunting_, 136) says: “For that\r\nseries of events which extends from the borders of history back to the\r\nremote age, where the geologist, descending the stream of time, meets\r\nthe archæologist, I have adopted the term _prehistoric_.”\r\n\r\nThe divisions of prehistoric time now most commonly employed are:\r\nFor the oldest, the Palæolithic age, as Lubbock first termed it,\r\nwhich, with a shadowy termination, has an unknown beginning, covering\r\nan interval geologically of vast extent. It is the primitive stone\r\nage, the epoch of flint-chippers; and but a single positive vestige\r\nof any community of living is known to archæologists: the village\r\nof Solutré, in Eastern France, being held by some to be associated\r\nwith man in this earlier stage of his development. This stone period\r\nis sometimes divided in Europe into an earlier and later period,\r\nrepresenting respectively the men of the river drift and of the caves.\r\nIn the first period, called sometimes that of the race of Canstadt,\r\nand by Mortillet the Chellean period, we have, as is claimed, a savage\r\nhunter race, represented by the Neanderthal skull; and because in two\r\njaw-bones discovered the genial tubercle is undeveloped, a school of\r\narchæologists contend that the race was speechless (Horatio Hale’s\r\n“Origin of Language,” in _Am. Asso. Adv. Sci. Proc._, xxxv., Cambridge,\r\n1886; and separate, p. 31). This theory, however, seems to rest on a\r\nmisconception. Cf. Topinard on the jaw-bone from the Naulette cave in\r\nthe _Revue d’Anthropologie_, 3d ser. i., p. 422 (1886). It is held\r\nthat the ethnical relations of this race are unknown, and it is not\r\npalpably connected with the race of the later period, the race of the\r\ncaves, which archæologists, like Carl Vogt, Lartet, and Christy, call\r\nthe cave-bear epoch, as its evidences are found in the cave deposits of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM DAWSON’S FOSSIL MEN.\r\n\r\nA front view of a Hochelagan skull, surrounded by the outline, on a\r\nlarger scale, of the Cro-magnon skull.]\r\n\r\nThis cave race is represented by the Cro-magnon skull, and, as Dawkins\r\nholds, is perpetuated to-day by the Eskimo, and was very likely\r\nalso represented in the Guanches of the Canary Islands. Quatrefages\r\ncalls it the race of Cro-magnon; and the vanishing of it into the\r\nNeolithic people is obscure. It is claimed by some, but the evidence is\r\nquestionable, that the development of the muscles of speech make this\r\nrace the first to speak, and that thus man, as a speaking being, is\r\nprobably not ten thousand years old.\r\n\r\nThe interval before the shaped and polished stone implements were used\r\nmay have been long in some places, and the gradation may have been\r\nconfused in others; and it is indeed sometimes said that the one and\r\nthe other condition exist in savage regions at the present day, as\r\nmany archæologists hold that they have always existed, side by side,\r\nthough this proposition is also denied. Indeed, it is a question if the\r\nterms of the archæologist, signifying ages or epochs, have any time\r\nvalue, being rather characteristics of stages of development than of\r\npassing time. Those who find the ruder implements to stand for a people\r\nliving with the cave-bear find, as they contend, a shorter-headed race\r\nproducing these finer stone implements, and call it the Reindeer epoch.\r\nOne of Lubbock’s terms, the Neolithic age, has gained larger acceptance\r\nas a designation for this period since 1865, when he introduced it.\r\nWith these polished stones we first find signs of domestic animals\r\nand of the practice of agriculture. Any considerable collection of\r\nthese stone implements and ornaments will present to the observer\r\ngreat varieties, but with steady types, of such implements as axes,\r\ncelts, hammers, knives, drills, scrapers, mortars and pestles, pitted\r\nstones, plummets, sinkers, spear-points, arrow-heads, daggers, pipes,\r\ngorgets,—not to name others.\r\n\r\nOn the American stone age, see Nadaillac, _Les premiers hommes_, p. 37;\r\nL. P. Gratacap in _Amer. Antiquarian_, iv.; and W. J. McGee, in _Pop.\r\nSci.

Brinton\r\n(_Myths_, p. 40) thinks it the best work yet written on the American\r\nIndians, though he thinks that Waitz errs on the religious aspects.\r\nWaitz has fully discussed the question of climate as affecting the\r\ndevelopment of people, and this is included with full references in\r\nthat part of his great work which in the English translation is called\r\nan _Introduction to Anthropology_. Wallace and other observers contend\r\nthat the direct efficacy of physical conditions is overrated, and that\r\nclimate is but one of the many factors. F. H. Cushing discusses the\r\nquestion of habitation as affected by surroundings in the _Fourth Ann.\r\nRept. Bur. of Ethnol._, p. 473.\r\n\r\n[1619] Cf.

Archæology in\r\nJan., 1863, which was reprinted in the _Smithsonian Report_ for 1862,\r\nand was translated in the _Revue Archéologique_, 1865.\r\n\r\nThis book of Lubbock’s and Tylor’s correlative work probably represent\r\nthe best dealing with the subject in English; and some such book as\r\nJas. A. Farrer’s _Primitive Manners and Customs_ (N. Y., 1879) will\r\nlead up to them with readers less studious. The English reader may\r\nfind some comparative treatments in the English version of Waitz’s\r\n_Introd. to Anthropology_ (p. 284), etc.; much that is suggestive and\r\nin some way supplemental to Tylor and Lubbock in Wilson’s _Prehistoric\r\nMan_; some vigorous and perhaps sweeping characterizations in Lesley’s\r\n_Origin and Destiny of Man_ (ch. 6); and other aspects in Winchell’s\r\n_Preadamites_ (ch. 26), Foster’s _Prehistoric Races of the U.

Bradford,\r\nin his _American Antiquities_, held the barbarous American to be\r\na degraded remnant of a society originally more cultivated; and a\r\nsimilar view was held by S. F. Jarvis in his _Discourse_ before the\r\nNew York Hist. Soc. (Proc., iii., N. Y., 1821). Cf. Büchner’s _Man_,\r\nEng. transl., 67, 276. Rawlinson (_Antiquity of man historically\r\nconsidered_) considers savagery a “corruption and degradation,—the\r\nresult of adverse circumstances during a long period.”\r\n\r\n[1626] N. Y., 1869; originally in _Good Words_, Mar.-June, 1868.\r\n\r\n[1627] Dawson’s _Fossil Men and their modern representatives_ (London,\r\n1880, 1883) is “an attempt to illustrate the characters and conditions\r\nof prehistoric men in Europe by those of the American races.” A\r\nconservative reliance on the biblical record, as long understood,\r\ncharacterizes Dawson’s usual speculations. Cf. his _Nature and the\r\nBible_, his _Story of the Earth_, his _Origin of the World_, and\r\nhis _Address_ as president of the geological section of the Amer.\r\nAssociation in 1876. He confronts his opponents’ views of the long\r\nperiods necessary to effect geographical changes by telling them that\r\nin historic times “the Hyrcanian ocean has dried up and Atlantis has\r\ngone down.”\r\n\r\n[1628] Dawson (_Fossil Men_, 218) says: “I think that American\r\narchæologists and geologists must refuse to accept the distinction of\r\na palæolithic from a neolithic period until further evidence can be\r\nobtained.”\r\n\r\n[1629] These are very nearly the views of Winchell in his\r\n_Preadamites_, p. 420.\r\n\r\n[1630] Cf. his papers in _Methodist Quarterly_, xxxvi. 581; xxxvii. 29.\r\n\r\n[1631] This is also considered important evidence by Dawson, as well\r\nas Winchell’s estimate, in his _5th Report, Minnesota Geol. Survey_\r\n(1876), of the 8,000 or 9,000 years necessary for the falls of St.\r\nAnthony to have worked back from Fort Snelling. Edw. Fontaine’s _How\r\nthe World was peopled_ (N. Y., 1872) is another expression of this\r\nrecent-origin belief.\r\n\r\n[1632] This cataclysmic element of force, as opposed to the gradual\r\nuniformity theory of Lyell, finds expounders in Huxley and Prestwich,\r\nand is the burden of H. H. Howorth’s _Mammoth and the Flood_ (London,\r\n1887) in its palæontological and archæological aspects, its geological\r\naspects having been touched by him so far only in some papers in the\r\n_Geological Mag._ This great overthrow of the gigantic animals, during\r\nwhich the man intermediate between the palæolithic and neolithic age\r\nlived, was not universal, so that the less unwieldy species largely\r\nsaved themselves; and it was in effect the scriptural flood, of which\r\ntraditions were widely preserved among the North American tribes\r\n(_Mammoth and the Flood_, 307, 444).\r\n\r\n[1633] Southall answered his detractors in the _Methodist Quarterly_,\r\nxxxvii. 225. Geo. Rawlinson (_Antiq. of Man historically considered,\r\nPresent Day Tract, No. 9_, or _Journal of Christian Philosophy_,\r\nApril, 1883) speaks of the antiquity of prehistoric man as involving\r\nconsiderations “to a large extent speculative” as to limits, “that are\r\nto be measured not so much by centuries as by millenia.” He condenses\r\nthe arguments for a recent origin of man.\r\n\r\n[1634] There is a cursory survey in John Scoffern’s _Stray leaves of\r\nscience and folk lore_ (London, 1870).\r\n\r\n[1635] Cf. his papers in _Leisure Hour_, xxiii. 740, 766; xxvi. 54.\r\n\r\n[1636] Current periodical views can be traced in Poole’s _Index_ (vols.\r\ni. and ii.) under “Man,” “Races,” “Prehistoric,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe views of the cosmogonists, running back to the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century, are followed down to the birth of modern geology in\r\nPattison’s _The Earth and the Word_ (Lond., 1858), and condensed in\r\nM’Clintock & Strong’s _Cyclopædia_ (iii. 795).\r\n\r\n[1637] _Verse 1._ In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.\r\n\r\n_Verse 2._ And the earth was without form and void, etc.\r\n\r\n[1638] Cf. also J. D. Whitney’s _Climatic Changes_. The present\r\nproportion of land to water is reckoned as four is to eleven. The\r\nocean’s average depth is variously estimated at from eleven to thirteen\r\ntimes that of the average elevation of land above water, or as 11,000\r\nor 13,000 feet is to 1,000 feet. The bulk of water on the globe is\r\ncomputed at thirty-six times the cubic measurement of the land above\r\nwater (_Ibid._ 194, 209).\r\n\r\n[1639] For an extended discussion of the Atlantis question, see _ante_,\r\nch. 1.\r\n\r\n[1640] It is enough to indicate the necessary correlation of this\r\nsubject with the transformation theory of J. B. A. Lamarck as\r\nenunciated in his _Philosophie Zoologique_ (Paris, 1809; again, 1873),\r\nwhich Cuvier opposed; and with the new phase of it in what is called\r\nDarwinism, a theory of the survival of the fittest, leading ultimately\r\nto man. Lyell (_Principles of Geology_, 11th ed., ii, 495) presents\r\nthe diverse sides of the question, which is one hardly germane to our\r\npresent purpose.\r\n\r\n[1641] London, 1863, 3 eds., each enlarged; Philad., 1863. In his final\r\nedition Lyell acknowledges his obligations to Lubbock’s _Prehistoric\r\nMan_ and John Evans’s _Anc. Stone Implements_. His final edition is\r\ncalled: _The geological evidences of the antiquity of man, with an\r\noutline of glacial and post-tertiary geology and remarks on the origin\r\nof species with special reference to man’s first appearance on the\r\nearth_. 4th ed., revised (London, 1873).\r\n\r\n[1642] _Recent Origin of Man_, p. 10.\r\n\r\n[1643] Another way of looking at it gives reasons for this omission:\r\n“The first chapter of Genesis is not a geological treatise. It is\r\nabsolutely valueless in geological discussion, and has no value\r\nwhatever save as representing what the Jews borrowed from the\r\nBabylonians, and as preserving for us an early cosmology” (Howorth’s\r\n_Mammoth and the Flood_, Lond., 1887, p. ix). Between Lyell and Gabriel\r\nde Mortillet (_La préhistorique Antiquité de l’Homme_, Paris, 1881) on\r\nthe one hand and Southall on the other, there are the more cautious\r\ngeologists, like Prestwich, who claim that we must wait before we can\r\nthink of measuring by years the interval from the earliest men. (Cf.\r\n“Theoretical considerations on the drift containing implements,” in\r\n_Roy. Soc. Philos. Trans._, 1862)\r\n\r\n[1644] Cf. _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, Apr., 1873, p. 33.\r\n\r\n[1645] Winchell’s book is an enlargement of an article contributed by\r\nhim to M’Clintock and Strong’s _Cyclopædia of Biblical literature_,\r\netc. (vol viii., 1879),—the editors of which, by their foot-notes,\r\nshowed themselves uneasy under some of his inferences and conclusions,\r\nwhich do not agree with their conservative views.\r\n\r\n[1646] Lois Agassiz advanced (1863) this view of the first emergence\r\nof land in America, in the _Atlantic Monthly_, xi. 373; also in _Geol.\r\nSketches_, p. 1,—marking the Laurentian hills along the Canadian\r\nborders of the United States as the primal continent. Cf. Nott and\r\nGliddon’s _Types of Mankind_, ch. 9. Mortillet holds that so late as\r\nthe early quaternary period Europe was connected with America by a\r\nregion now represented by the Faröes, Iceland, and Greenland.

The biblical record restrains Southall in\r\nall his estimates of the antiquity of man in America, as shown in his\r\n_Recent Origin of Man_, ch. 36, and _Epoch of the Mammoth_, ch. 25.\r\n\r\n[1647] Hugh Falconer (_Palæontological Memoirs_, ii. 579) says: “The\r\nearliest date to which man has as yet been traced back in Europe is\r\nprobably but as yesterday in comparison with the epoch at which he made\r\nhis appearance in more favored regions.”\r\n\r\n[1648] Cf. also Putnam’s _Report_ in Wheeler’s Survey, 1879, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[1649] Cf. H. H. Bancroft, iv. 703: Short, 125, etc.\r\n\r\n[1650] Dr. Brinton concludes that since the region is one of a rapid\r\ndeposition of strata, the tracks may not be older than quaternary.

Rev._, Oct., 1883, p.\r\n338. Tylor (_Early Hist. of Mankind_, 197) says “Geological evidence,\r\nthough capable of showing the lapse of vast periods of time, has\r\nscarcely admitted of these periods being brought into definite\r\nchronological terms.” Prestwich (_On the geol. position and age of\r\nflint-implement-bearing beds_, London, 1864,—from the _Roy. Soc. Phil.\r\nTrans._) says: “However we extend our present chronology with respect\r\nto the first appearance of men, it is at present unsafe and premature\r\nto count by hundreds of thousands of years.” Southall (_Recent Origin\r\nof Man_, ch. 33) epitomizes the extreme views of the advocates of\r\nglaciation in the present temperate zone.\r\n\r\n[1655] Cf. Louis Agassiz, _Geological Sketches_ (1865), p. 210; 2d\r\nseries (1886), p. 77.\r\n\r\n[1656] J. Adhémer, _Revolutions de la Mer_, who advocates this theory,\r\nconnects with it the movement of the apsides, and thinks that it is\r\nthe consequent great accumulation of ice at the north pole which by\r\nits weight displaces the centre of gravity; and as the action is\r\ntransferred from one pole to the other, the periodic oscillation of\r\nthat centre of gravity is thus caused. The theory no doubt borrows\r\nsomething of its force with some minds from the great law of mutability\r\nin nature. That it is a grand field for such theorizers as Lorenzo\r\nBurge, his _Preglacial Man and the Aryan Race_ shows; but authorities\r\nlike Lyell and Sir John Herschel find no sufficient reason in it\r\nfor the great ice-sheet which they contend for. Cf. H. Le Hon’s\r\n_Influence des lois cosmiques sur la climatologie et la géologie_\r\n(Bruxelles, 1868). W. B. Galloway’s _Science and Geology in relation\r\nto the Universal Deluge_ (Lond., 1888) points out what he thinks the\r\nnecessary effects of such changes of axis. J. D. Whitney (_Climatic\r\nchanges of later geological times, Mem. Mus. Comp. Zoöl._, vii. 392,\r\n394) disbelieves all these views, and contends that the most eminent\r\nastronomers and climatologists are opposed to them.\r\n\r\n[1657] Of the manifold reasons which have been assigned for these\r\ngreat climatic changes (Lubbock, _Prehistoric Times_, 391, and Croll,\r\n_Discussions_, enumerates the principal reasons) there is at least\r\nsome considerable credence given to the one of which James Croll has\r\nbeen the most prominent advocate, and which points to that reduction\r\nof the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit which in 22,000 years will\r\nbe diminished from the present scale to one sixth of it, or to about\r\nhalf a million miles. This change in the eccentricity induces physical\r\nchanges, which allow a greater or less volume of tropical water to flow\r\nnorth. In this way the once mild climate of Greenland is accounted\r\nfor (Wallace’s _Island Life_). Croll first advanced his views in the\r\nPhilosophical Mag., Aug., 1864; but he did not completely formulate his\r\ntheory till in his _Climate and time in their geological relations, a\r\ntheory of secular changes of the earth’s climate_ (N. Y., 1875). It\r\ngained the acquiescence of Lyell and others; but a principal objector\r\nappeared in the astronomer Simon Newcomb (_Amer. Jl. of Sci. and Arts_,\r\nApril, 1876; Jan., 1884; _Philosoph. Mag._, Feb., 1884). Croll answered\r\nin _Remarks_ (London, 1884), but more fully in a further development of\r\nhis views in his _Discussions on Climate and Cosmology_ (N. Y., 1886).\r\nWhitney’s _Climatic Changes_ argues on entirely different grounds.\r\n\r\n[1658] _Principles of Geology_, ch. 10-13, where he gives a secondary\r\nplace to the arguments of Croll.\r\n\r\n[1659] Emile Cartailhac’s _L’Age de pierre dans les souvenirs et\r\nsuperstitions populaires_ (Paris, 1877).\r\n\r\n[1660] Joly, _L’Homme avant les métaux_, or in the English transl.,\r\n_Man before Metals_, ch. 2. Nadaillac (_Les Premiers Hommes_, i. 127)\r\nreproduces Mahudel’s cuts.\r\n\r\n[1661] Foster, _Prehistoric Races_, 50, notes some obscure facts which\r\nmight indicate that man lived back of the glacial times, in the Miocene\r\ntertiary period. These are the discoveries associated with the names of\r\nDesnoyers and the Abbé Bourgeois, and familiar enough to geologists.\r\nThey have found little credence. Cf. Lubbock’s _Prehistoric Times_,\r\n410, and his _Scientific Lectures_, 140; Büchner’s _Man_, p. 31;\r\nNadaillac’s _Les Premiers Hommes_, ii, 425; and _L’Homme tertiaire_\r\n(Paris, 1885); Peschel’s _Races of Men_, p. 34; Edward Clodd in _Modern\r\nReview_, July, 1880; Dawkins’ _Address_, Salford, 1877, p. 9; Joly,\r\n_Man before Metals_, 177. Quatrefages (_Human Species_, N. Y., 1879,\r\np. 150) assents to their authenticity. Many of these look to the later\r\ntertiary (Pliocene) as the beginning of the human epoch; but Dawkins\r\n(_No. Am. Rev._, cxxxvii, 338; cf. his _Early Man in Britain_, p. 90),\r\nas well as Huxley, say that all real knowledge of man goes not back of\r\nthe quaternary. Cf. further, Quatrefages, _Introd. à l’étude des races\r\nhumaines_ (Paris, 1887), p. 91; and his _Nat. Hist. Man_ (N. Y., 1874),\r\np. 44.\r\n\r\nWinchell (McClintock and Strong’s _Cyclopædia_, viii. 491-2, and in\r\nhis _Preadamites_) concisely classes the evidences of tertiary man as\r\n“Preglacial remains erroneously supposed human,” and “Human remains\r\nerroneously supposed pre-glacial;” but he confines these conclusions\r\nto Europe only, allowing that the American non-Caucasian man might,\r\nperhaps, be carried back (p. 492) into the tertiary age.\r\n\r\nCf. on the tertiary (Pliocene) man, E. S. Morse in _Amer. Naturalist_,\r\nxviii. 1001,—an address at the Philad. meeting, Am. Asso. Adv. Science\r\nand his earlier paper in the _No. Amer. Rev._; C. C. Abbott in _Kansas\r\nCity Rev._, iii. 413 (also see iv. 84, 326); _Cornhill Mag._, li. 254\r\n(also in _Pop. Sci. Monthly_, xxvii. 103, and _Eclectic Mag._, civ.\r\n601). Dr. Morton believed that the Eocene man, of the oldest tertiary\r\ngroup, would yet be discovered. Agassiz, in 1865 (_Geol. Sketches_,\r\n200), thought the younger naturalists would live to see sufficient\r\nproofs of the tertiary man adduced. S. R. Pattison (_Age of Man\r\ngeologically considered in Present Day Tract, no. 13_, or _Journal of\r\nChrist. Philos._ July, 1883) does not believe in the tertiary man,\r\ninstancing, among other conclusions, that no trace of cereals is found\r\nin the tertiary strata, and that these strata show other conditions\r\nunfavorable to human life. His conclusions are that man has existed\r\nonly about 8,000 years, and that it is impossible for geological\r\nscience at present to confute or disprove it. In his view man appeared\r\nin the first stage of the quaternary period, was displaced by floods in\r\nthe second, and for the third lived and worked on the present surface.\r\n\r\n[1662] Lyell’s _Antiquity of Man_, 4th ed., ch. 18.

Buffon first formulated\r\nthe belief in extinct animals from some mastodon bones and teeth sent\r\nto him from the Big Bone Lick in Kentucky, about 1740, and Cuvier first\r\napplied the name mastodon, though from the animal’s resemblance to the\r\nSiberian mammoth it has sometimes been called by the latter name. There\r\nare in reality the fossil remains of both mastodon and mammoth found in\r\nAmerica.

Koch\r\nrepresented that he found the remains of a mastodon in Missouri, with\r\nthe proofs about the relics that the animal had been slain by stone\r\njavelins and arrows (_St. Louis Acad. of Sci. Trans._, i. 62, 1857).\r\nThe details have hardly been accepted on Koch’s word, since some\r\ndoubtful traits of his character have been made known (Short, _No.\r\nAmer. of Antiq._, 116; Nadaillac, _L’Amérique préhistorique_, 37).\r\nThere have been claims also advanced for a stone resembling a hatchet,\r\nfound with such animals in the modified drift of Jersey Co., Illinois.\r\nE. L. Berthoud (_Acad. Nat. Sci., Philad. Proc._ 1872) has reported\r\non human relics found with extinct animals in Wyoming and Colorado.\r\nDr. Holmes (_Ibid._ July, 1859) had described pottery found with the\r\nbones of the megatherium. Lyell seems to have hesitated to associate\r\nman with the extinct animals in America, when the remains found at\r\nNatchez were shown to him in an early visit to America (_Antiquity\r\nof Man_, 237). Howorth, _Mammoth and the Flood_, 317, enumerates the\r\nlater discoveries, some being found under recent conditions (_Ibid._\r\n278), and so recent that the trunk itself has been observed (p. 299).\r\nIn the earliest instance of the bones being reported, Dr. Mather,\r\ncommunicating the fact to the _Philosophical Trans. Roy. Soc._ (1714),\r\nxxix. 63, says they were found in the Hudson River, and he supposed\r\nthem the remains of a giant man, while the colored earth about the\r\nbones represented his rotted body.

Bull_., xv. 86) says that those at\r\nPine Grove, near Salem, Mass., were examined in 1840. The map which\r\nis annexed of those on Cape Cod, taken from the _Smithsonian Report_\r\n(1883, p. 905), shows the frequency of them in a confined area, as\r\nobserved; but the same region doubtless includes many not observed.\r\n\r\nFor those on the New Jersey coast see Cook’s _Geology of New Jersey_\r\n(Newark, 1868), and Rau in the _Smithsonian Reports_, 1863, 1864, 1865.\r\nThe Lockwood collection from the heap at Keyport is in the Peabody\r\nMuseum (cf. _Rept._, xxii. 43). Francis Jordan describes the _Remains\r\nof an Aboriginal Encampment at Rehoboth, Delaware_ (Philad., 1880).\r\nElmer R. Reynolds reported on “Precolumbian shell heaps at Newburg,\r\nMaryland, and the aboriginal shell heaps of the Potomac and Wicomico\r\nrivers” at the _Congrès des Américanistes_ (Copenhagen, 1883, p. 292).\r\nJoseph Leidy describes those at Cape Henlopen in the _Phil. Acad. Nat.\r\nSci._, 1866. Those on the Georgia coast, St. Simon’s Island, etc., are\r\npointed out in C. C. Jones’s _Antiquities of the Southern Indians;\r\nSmithsonian Repts._, 1871 (by D. Brown); in Lyell’s _Antiq. of Man_,\r\nand in his _Second Visit to the U. S._ (N. Y., 1849), i. 252.\r\n\r\nThe shell heaps of Florida have had unusual attention. Wyman has\r\nindicated the absence of objects in them, showing Spanish contact. Dr.\r\nBrinton’s first studies of them were in his _Notes on the Floridian\r\nPeninsula_ (Philad., 1859), ch. 6, and again in the _Smithsonian\r\nReport_ (1866), p. 356. Prof. Wyman’s first reports (St. John River)\r\nwere in _The American Naturalist_, Jan., Oct., Nov., 1868. He also\r\ndescribed them in the _Peabody Mus. Report_, i., v., vii., and in his\r\n_Fresh Water Shell Heaps of the St. John River, Florida_ (Salem, 1875),\r\nbeing no. 4 of the _Memoirs of the Peabody Acad. of Science_. There are\r\nother investigations recorded in the _Smithsonian Reports_, 1877, by S.\r\nP. Mayberry, on St. John River; 1879, by S. T. Walker, on Tampa Bay;\r\nalso by A. W. Vogeler in _Amer. Naturalist_, Jan., 1879; by W. H. Dall\r\nin the _American Journal of Archæology_, i. 184; and by A. E. Douglass\r\nin the _Amer. Antiquarian_, vii. 74, 140. On those of Alabama, see\r\n_Peabody Mus.

Schumacher);\r\n_American Antiquarian_, vii. 159; and _Journal of the Anthropological\r\nInstitute_, v. 489. Schumacher covers the northwest coast in the\r\n_Smithsonian Rept._, 1873. Those in Oregon are reported to be destitute\r\nof the bones of extinct animals, in the _Bull. U. S. Geol. Survey_,\r\niii. Bancroft, _Nat. Races_, iv. 739, refers to those on Vancouver’s\r\nIsland. W. H. Dall describes those on the Aleutian Islands in the\r\n_Contributions to No. Amer. Ethnology_, i. 41.\r\n\r\n[1687] This branch of archæological science began, I believe, with\r\nthe discovery by Sir Wm. R. Wilde of some lacustrine habitations in a\r\nsmall lake in county Meath. R. Monro’s _Ancient Scotch lake Dwellings_\r\n(Edinburgh, 1882) has gathered what is known of the remains in Great\r\nBritain. There are similar remains in various parts of the continent\r\nof Europe; but those revealed by the dry season of 1853-54 in the\r\nSwiss lakes have attracted the most notice. Dr. Keller described them\r\nin _Reports_ made to the Archæological Society of Zurich. A. Morlot\r\nprinted an abstract of Keller’s Report in the _Smithsonian Report_,\r\n1863. In 1866, J. E. Lee arranged Keller’s material systematically, and\r\ntranslated it in _The Lake Dwellings of Switzerland and other parts\r\nof Europe, by Ferdinand Keller_ (London, 1866), which was reissued,\r\nenlarged and brought down to date, in a second edition in 1878. The\r\nearliest elaborated account was Prof. Troyon’s _Habitations lacustres_\r\n(1860), of which there was a translation in the _Smithsonian Reports_,\r\n1860, 1861. Troyon and Keller have reached different conclusions: the\r\none believing that the traces of development in the remains indicate\r\nnew peoples coming in, while Keller holds these to be signs of the\r\nprogress of the same people. A paper by Edouard Desor, _Palafittes or\r\nLacustrian Constructions_, appeared in English in the _Smithsonian\r\nReport_, 1865. There is a large collection of typical relics from these\r\nlake dwellings in the Peabody Museum (_Report_, v.).\r\n\r\nThese evidences now make part of all archæological treatises: Lyell’s\r\n_Antiq. of Man_; Lubbock, _Prehist.

It is generally recognized that the cliff dwellers and the\r\nPueblo people were the same race, and that the modern Zuñi and Moquis\r\nrepresent them. Bandelier in _Archæol. Inst. of Am., 5th Rept._ J.\r\nStevenson (_Second Rept. Bur. of Ethnol._, 431) describes some cavate\r\ndwellings of this region cut out of the rock by hand. There is no\r\nevidence that these remains call for any association with them of the\r\ngreat antiquity of man.\r\n\r\n[1691] Cf., for instance, Short, 331.\r\n\r\n[1692] Morgan (_Systems of Consanguinity_, 257) finds correspondence\r\nto the roving Indian in physical and cranial character, in linguistic\r\ntraits, and in the similarity of arts and social habits. Their\r\nconnection with the moundbuilder and cliff-dwelling race is traced in\r\nH. F. C. Ten Kate’s _Reizen en Onderzolkingen in Nord America_ (Leyden,\r\n1885). Cushing thinks (_Fourth Rept. Bur. Ethnol._, 481) they got their\r\nhabit of building in stories from having, as cliff-dwellers, earlier\r\nbuilt on the narrow shelves of the rocks. Morgan (_Peab. Mus. Rept._,\r\nxii. 550) thinks their architectural art deteriorated, since the ruined\r\npueblos are finer constructions than those inhabited now. Cf. on the\r\norigin of Pueblo architecture V.

Charlevoix.\r\n\r\n[1731] This was Dr. J. C. Warren’s view in 1837, in a paper before the\r\n_Brit. Asso. Adv. Science_. Cf. also Blumenbach, Morton, Nott, and\r\nGliddon.\r\n\r\n[1732] Bancroft (_Nat. Races_, v. 539) thinks they were connected\r\nin some obscure way with these southern nations, and in 1875 could\r\nwrite (p. 787) that “most and the best authorities deem it impossible\r\nthat the moundbuilders were ever the remote ancestors of the Indian\r\ntribes.” Dawson (_Fossil Men_, 55) deems the modern Pueblo Indians\r\nto be their representatives. Brasseur supposes the Toltecs came from\r\nthem. (Cf. also Short, 492; and S. B. Evans, in _Kansas City Rev._,\r\nMarch, 1882.) John Wells Foster, who had for some years written on the\r\nsubject, gathered his results in a composite volume, _Prehistoric Races\r\nof the United States_ (Chicago, 1873, 1878, 1881, etc.), in which he\r\nheld to the theory of their migrating south and developing into the\r\ncivilization of Central America. Cf. his paper in the _Trans. Chicago\r\nAcad. Nat. Sci._, vol. i., and his abstract of it in his _Mississippi\r\nValley_ (1869, p. 415). J. P. MacLean’s _Moundbuilders_ (Cincinnati,\r\n1879) takes similar ground. Morgan (_Peab. Mus. Rept._, xii. 552)\r\nholds that they cannot be classed with any known Indian “stock,” and\r\nthat the “nearest region from which they could have been derived is\r\nNew Mexico.” Wills de Haas takes exception to this view in the _Trans.\r\nAnthropological Soc. of Washington_ (1881). Cf. R. S. Robertson in\r\n_Compte Rendu, Congrès des Américanistes_ (1877), xi. 39.\r\n\r\n[1733] Major Powell says, that years ago he reached the conclusion\r\nthat the modern Indians must have raised at least some of the mounds\r\nin the Mississippi Valley (_Bur. of Ethnol. Rept._, iv. p. xxx).\r\nCf. also Powell’s paper in _Science_, x. 267. In the second of\r\nthese reports (p. 117) Henry W. Henshaw sets forth the views, which\r\nthe Bureau maintained; and he defended these views in the _Amer.\r\nAntiquarian_, viii. 102. The leading member, however, of the Bureau\r\nstaff, who is working in this field, is Cyrus Thomas. In the _Nat.\r\nMus. Report_ (1887) he defined the aim and character of the _Work in\r\nMound Exploration of the Bureau of Ethnology_, also issued separately.\r\nIn this it was stated that over 2,000 mounds had been opened, and\r\n38,000 relics gathered from them; but nothing to afford any clue to the\r\nlanguage which the moundbuilders spoke. The conclusions reached were:—\r\n\r\n_First_, the mounds are as diversified as the Indian tribes are.\r\n\r\n_Second_, they yield no signs of a superior race.\r\n\r\n_Third_, their builders and the Indians are the same.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_, the accounts of the early European visitors of the Indians\r\nfound here correspond to the disclosures of the mounds.\r\n\r\n_Fifth_, certain kinds of mounds in certain localities are the work of\r\ntribes now known; and there are no signs about the mounds to connect\r\nthem with the Pueblo Indians or those farther south.\r\n\r\nThomas, in the _Fifth Report_ (1888) described the “Burial Mounds of\r\nthe northern sections of the U. S.” He says that the character of the\r\nmounds and their contents indicate the possibility of dividing the\r\nterritory they occupy roughly into eight districts, each with some\r\nprominent characteristic, and he roughly distinguishes these sections\r\nas of Wisconsin; the Upper Mississippi; Ohio; New York; Appalachian;\r\nthe Middle Mississippi; the Lower Mississippi and the Gulf. He holds\r\nthat the moundbuilding people existed from about the fifth or sixth\r\ncentury down to historic times.\r\n\r\nTaking for his texts the mounds of the Appalachian districts, he\r\nhas presented anew his grounds for believing this region at least\r\nto have had the red Indian race for the constructors of its mounds,\r\nand that the Cherokees were that race. Carr had already (1876), from\r\ninvestigating a truncated oval mound in Virginia, and comparing it with\r\nBartram’s (_Travels_, 365) description of a Cherokee council-house\r\n(_Peabody Mus. Rept._, x. 75), reached the conclusion that that\r\nparticular mound was built by the Cherokees. Thomas further undertakes\r\nto prove that the Cherokees once occupied the Appalachian region, and\r\nthat implements of the white men are found in some of the mounds,\r\nbringing them down to a period since the contact with Europeans. The\r\nhabits of the builders of these mounds are, as he affirms, known to\r\ncorrespond to what we know from historic evidence were the habits of\r\nthe Cherokees.\r\n\r\nThomas has also communicated the views of the Bureau in other ways, as\r\nin the _Amer. Antiquarian_, vi. 90; vii. 65; _Mag. Amer. Hist._, May,\r\n1884, p. 396; 1887, p. 193; July and Sept., 1888. In these papers,\r\namong other points, he maintains that the defensive enclosures of\r\nnorthern Ohio are due to the Iroquois-Huron tribes, and he accepts the\r\nview of Peet and Latham, that the animal mounds are more ancient than\r\nthe simpler forms. Other investigators have adopted, in some degree,\r\nthis view. Horatio Hale thinks the Cherokees of Iroquois origin, and\r\nthat they may have mingled with the moundbuilders. C. C. Baldwin holds\r\nthe Allegheni, Cherokees, and the moundbuilders to be the same.\r\n\r\nProminent among those who have adopted this red-Indian theory are Judge\r\nM. F. Force and Lucien Carr. In 1874 Force published at Cincinnati\r\na paper, which he read before the literary club of that city; and\r\nin 1877 he prepared a paper on the race of the moundbuilders, which\r\nappears in French in the _Compte Rendu, Congrès des Américanistes_\r\n(1877, i. p. 121), and in English, _To what Race did the Moundbuilders\r\nbelong_ (Cincinnati, 1875). He maintains that the race, which shows no\r\ndifferences from the modern Indians, flourished till about 1,000 years\r\nago, and that some of them still survived in the Gulf States in the\r\nsixteenth century, and that their development was about on the plane of\r\nthe Pueblos, higher than the Algonquins and lower than the Aztecs.\r\n\r\nCarr’s _Mounds of the Mississippi Valley historically considered_\r\nmakes part of the second volume of Shaler’s _Kentucky Survey_, and was\r\nalso issued separately (1883). It is the most elaborate collation of\r\nthe accounts of the early travellers, and of others coming in contact\r\nwith the Indians at an early day, which has yet been made, and his\r\nfoot-notes are an ample bibliography of this aspect of the subject. He\r\nholds that these early records prove that nothing has been found in the\r\nmounds which was not described in the early narratives as pertaining\r\nto the Indians of the early contact. He aims also particularly to show\r\nthat these early Indians were agriculturists and sun-worshippers.\r\nBrinton, reviewing the paper in the _American Antiquarian_ (1883, p.\r\n68), holds that Carr goes too far, and practises the arts of a special\r\npleader. Brinton’s own opinions seem somewhat to have changed. In the\r\n_Hist. Mag._, Feb., 1866, p. 35, he considers the moundbuilders as not\r\nadvanced beyond the red Indians; and in the _American Antiquarian_\r\n(1881), iv. 9, in inquiring into their probable nationality, he thinks\r\nthey were an ancient people who were driven south and became the\r\nmoundbuilding Chahta.\r\n\r\nOther supporters of the red Indian view are Edmund Andrews, in the\r\n_Wisconsin Acad. of Science_, iv. 126; P. R. Hoy, in _Ibid._ vi.;\r\nO. T. Mason, in _Science_, iii. 658; Nadaillac, in _L’Amérique\r\npréhistorique_; E. Schmidt, in _Kosmos_ (Leipzig), viii. 81, 163; G. P.\r\nThurston, in _Mag. Amer. Hist._, 1888, xix. 374.\r\n\r\n[1734] This is denied in Fred. Larkin’s _Anc. Man in America_ (N. Y.).\r\n\r\n[1735] J. D. Baldwin’s _Anc. America_ (N. Y., 1871). D. Wilson’s\r\n_Prehistoric Man_, i. ch. 10, etc., who holds that “the moundbuilders\r\nwere greatly more in advance of the Indian hunter than behind the\r\ncivilized Mexican;” and he claims that the proof deduced from the\r\nIndian type of a head discovered in a moundbuilder’s pipe (i. 366) is\r\ndue to a perverted drawing in Squier and Davis. Short, _No. Amer. of\r\nAntiq._, believed they were of the race later in Anahuac. Gay, _Pop.\r\nHist. U. S._, i. ch. 2, believes in the theory of a vanished race. In\r\n1775 Adair thought the works indicated a higher military energy than\r\nthe modern Indian showed.\r\n\r\n[1736] _Antiq. of Man_, 4th ed. 42.\r\n\r\n[1737] Putnam’s papers and the records of his investigations can be\r\nfound in his _Peabody Mus.

Peet, who edits this journal, has advanced in one of\r\nhis papers (vii. 82) that some of these earthworks are Indian game\r\ndrives and screens. (He also contributed a classification of them to\r\nthe _Congrès des Américanistes_, 1877, i. 103.) The paper by J. E.\r\nStevenson (ii. 89), and that by Horatio Hale on “Indian Migrations”\r\n(Jan.-April, 1883), are worth noting. The _Compte Rendu, Congrès des\r\nAméricanistes_, 1875 (i. 387), has Joly’s “Les Moundbuilders, leurs\r\nŒuvres et leurs Caractères Ethniques,” and that for 1877 has a paper by\r\nJohn H.

In the mounds of the Little Miami\r\nValley, native gold and meteoric iron have been found for the first\r\ntime (_Peab. Mus. Rept._, xvi. 170).\r\n\r\n[1747] See, on such impositions in general, MacLean’s _Moundbuilders_,\r\nch. 9; C. C. Abbott in _Pop. Sci. Monthly_, July, 1885, p. 308;\r\nWilson’s _Prehist. Man_, ii. ch. 19; Putnam in _Peab. Mus. Repts._,\r\nxvi. 184; _Fourth Rept. Bur. Ethnol._ 247.\r\n\r\nThe best known of the disputed relics are the following: The largest\r\nmound in the Ohio Valley is that of the Grave Creek, twelve miles\r\nbelow Wheeling, which was earliest described by its owner, A. B.\r\nTomlinson, in 1838. It is seventy feet high and one thousand feet in\r\ncircumference. (Cf. Squier and Davis, Foster, MacLean, _Olden Time_, i.\r\n232; and account by P. P. Cherry—Wadsworth, 1877.) About 1838 a shaft\r\nwas sunk by Tomlinson into it, and a rotunda constructed in its centre\r\nout of an original cavity, as a showroom for relics; and here, as taken\r\nfrom the mound, appeared two years later what is known as the Grave\r\nCreek stone, bearing an inscription of inscrutable characters. The\r\nsupposed relic soon attracted attention. H. R. Schoolcraft pronounced\r\nits twenty-two characters such “as were used by the Pelasgi,” in his\r\n_Observations respecting the Grave creek mound, in Western Virginia;\r\nthe antique inscription discovered in its excavation; and the connected\r\nevidence of the occupancy of the Mississippi valley during the mound\r\nperiod, and prior to the discovery of America by Columbus_, which\r\nappeared in the _Amer. Ethnological Soc. Trans._, i. 367 (N. Y.,\r\n1845). Cf. his _Indian Tribes_, iv. 118, where he thinks it may be an\r\n“intrusive antiquity.” The French savant Jomard published a _Note sur\r\nune pierre gravée_ (Paris, 1845, 1859), in which he thought it Libyan.\r\nLévy-Bing calls it Hebrew in _Congrès des Amér._ (Nancy, i. 215). Other\r\nnotices are by Moïse Schwab in _Revue Archéologique_, Feb., 1857; José\r\nPerez in _Arch. de la Soc. Amér. de France_ (1865), ii. 173; and in\r\nAmerica in the _Amer. Pioneer_, ii. 197; Haven’s _Archæol. U. S._,\r\n133, and _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, April 29, 1863, pp. 13, 32; _Amer.\r\nAntiquarian_, i. 139; Bancroft’s _Nat. Races_, v. 75.\r\n\r\nSquier promptly questioned its authenticity (_Amer. Ethnol. Soc.\r\nTrans._, ii.; _Aborig. Mts._, 168). Wilson laughed at it (_Prehistoric\r\nMan_, ii. 100). Col. Whittlesey has done more than any one to show\r\nits fraudulent character, and to show how the cuts of it which have\r\nbeen made vary (_Western Reserve, Hist. Soc. Tracts_), nos. 9 (1872),\r\n33 (1876), 42 (1878), and 44 (1879.) Cf. on this side Short, p. 419;\r\nand _Fourth Rept. Bur. Ethnol._, 250. Its authenticity is, however,\r\nmaintained by MacLean (_Moundbuilders_, Cinn., 1879), who summarizes\r\nthe arguments _pro_ and _con_.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as the Cincinnati tablet was found on the site of that\r\ncity in 1841 (_Amer. Pioneer_, ii. 195). Squier accepted it as genuine,\r\nand thought it might be a printing-stone for decorating hides (_Amer.\r\nEthnol. Soc. Trans._, ii.; _Aborig. Mts._ (1847), p. 70). Whittlesey\r\nat first doubted it (_West. Res. Hist. Tracts_, no. 9), but was later\r\nconvinced of its genuineness by Robert Clarke’s _Prehistoric Remains\r\nfound on the site of Cincinnati_ (privately printed, Cinn., 1876).\r\n\r\nThe so-called Berlin tablet was found in Ohio in 1876. S. D. Peet\r\nbelieves it genuine (_Amer. Antiq._, i. 73; vii. 222).\r\n\r\nOn the Rockford tablet, see Short, 44.\r\n\r\nThe Davenport tablets, found by the Rev. J. Gass in a mound near\r\nDavenport, in Jan., 1877, are described in the _Davenport Acad.\r\nProc._, ii. 96, 132, 221, 349; iii. 155. Cf. further in _Amer. Asso.\r\nAdv. Science Proc._ (April, 1877), by R. J. Farquharson; _Congrès des\r\nAmér._ (1877, ii. 158, with cut). The _American Antiquarian_ records\r\nthe controversy over its genuineness. In vol. iv. 145, John Campbell\r\nproposed a reading of the inscription. The suspicions are set forth in\r\nvii. 373. Peet, in viii. 46, inclines to consider it a fraud; and, p.\r\n92, there is a defence. Short (pp. 38-39) doubts. In the _Second Amer.\r\nRept. Bur. of Ethnol._, H. W. Henshaw, on “Animal Carvings,” attacked\r\nits character. (Cf. _Fourth Rept._, p. 251.) A reply by C. E. Putnam\r\nin vol. iv. of the _Davenport Acad. Proc._, and issued separately,\r\nis called _Vindication of the Authenticity of the Elephant pipes and\r\ninscribed tablets in the Mus. of the Davenport Acad._ (Davenport, Iowa,\r\n1885). Cf. Cyrus Thomas in _Science_, vi. 564; also Feb. 5, 1886, p.\r\n119. The question of the elephant pipes is included in the discussion,\r\nsome denying their genuineness. Cf. also _Amer. Antiq._, ii. 67; Short,\r\n531; Dr. Max Uhle in _Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_, 1887.\r\n\r\n[1748] It has been found convenient to follow an advancing line of\r\ngeographical succession, but the affiliations of the peoples of the\r\nmounds seem to indicate that those dwelling on both slopes and in the\r\nvalleys of the Appalachian ranges should be grouped together, as Thomas\r\ncombines them in his section on the mounds of the Appalachian District.\r\n(_Fifth Rept. Bur. Ethnol._)\r\n\r\n[1749] _Proc._, Oct. 23, 1849, p. 13; Belknap’s _New Hampshire_, iii.\r\n89; Haven’s _Archæol. U. S._, 42.\r\n\r\n[1750] D. A. Robertson, _Journal Amer. Geog. Soc._, vol. v., contends\r\nthat the North American mounds were built by a colony of Finns long\r\nbefore the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[1751] It was also issued, with some additional matter, at Buffalo\r\n(1851) as _Antiquities of New York State, with supplement on\r\nAntiquities of the West_ (1851). Squier has also at this time a paper\r\non these mounds in _N. Y. Hist. Soc. Proc._, Jan., 1849, p. 41. Cf.\r\n_Am. Journal of Science_, lxi. 305, and _Harper’s Monthly_, xx. and\r\nxxi. His conclusions, distinct from those pertaining to the Ohio\r\nmounds, were that the N. Y. earthworks were raised by the red Indians.\r\n\r\n[1752] Cf. W. M. Taylor on a Pennsylvania mound in _Smithsonian Rept._,\r\n1877.\r\n\r\n[1753] A few minor references may be given. The _Smithsonian Reports_\r\nhave papers by D. Trowbridge (1863); and by F. H. Cushing on those of\r\nOrleans County (1874). W. L. Stone held them to have been built by\r\nEgyptians, who afterward went south (_Mag. Amer. Hist._, Sept., 1878,\r\nii. 533). Cf. _Ibid._ v. 35, and S. L. Frey in the _Amer. Naturalist_,\r\nOct., 1879. A small book, _Ancient Man in America_ (N. Y., 1880), by\r\nFrederic Larkin, takes issue with Squier, and believes the builders\r\nwere not the modern Indians. He says he found in one of the N. Y.\r\nmounds, in 1854, a copper relic, with a mastodon, evidently in harness,\r\nscratched upon it! H. G. Mercer’s _Lenape Stone_ describes a “gorget\r\nstone” dug up in Buck’s County, Penn., in 1872, which shows a carving\r\nrepresenting a fight between Indians and the hairy mammoth, which we\r\nare also asked to accept as genuine. What is recognized as an ancient\r\nburial mound of the Senecas is described at some length in G. S.\r\nConover’s _Reasons why the State should acquire the famous burial mound\r\nof the Seneca Indians_ (1888).\r\n\r\n[1754] Contributions to a bibliography and lists of the Ohio mounds\r\nare found as follows: Mrs. Cyrus Thomas’s “Bibliog. of Earthworks in\r\nOhio” in the _Ohio Archæol. and Hist.

Cf. his _Emblematic Mounds_; and his paper in the _Wisconsin Hist.\r\nColl._, ix. 40.\r\n\r\n[1772] None of the bones of extinct animals have been found in\r\nthe mounds; nor has the buffalo, long a ranger of the Mississippi\r\nValley, been identified in the shapes of the mounds. (Cf. Peet on the\r\nidentification of animal mounds in _Amer. Antiq._, vi. 176.) Peet holds\r\nthey followed the mastodon period (_Ibid._ ix. 67). The elephant mound,\r\nso called, has been often shown in cuts. (Cf. _Smithsonian Rept._,\r\n1877, accompanying a paper by J. Warner, and Powell’s _Second Rept.\r\nBur. of Eth._, 153.)

Ethnol. Soc. Trans._ (1845), i. 335; by\r\nJoseph Jones in _Smithsonian Contributions_, xx. (1876), who connected\r\nthose who erected the works, through the Natchez Indians, with the\r\nNahuas. Edward O. Dunning had described some of the Tennessee relics\r\nin the _Peabody Mus. Repts._, iii., iv., and v.; but Putnam in no. xi.\r\n(1878) gave the results of his opening of the stone graves, with his\r\nexplorations of the sites of the villages of the people, and described\r\ntheir implements, nothing of which, as he said, showed contact with\r\nEuropeans. Cyrus Thomas deems these remains the works of the Indian\r\nrace (_Amer. Antiq._, vii. 129; viii. 162). The _Smithsonian Repts._\r\nhave had various papers on the Tennessee antiquities: I. Dille (1862);\r\nA. F. Danilsen (1863); M. C. Read (1867); E. A. Dayton, E. O. Dunning,\r\nE. M. Grant, and J. P. Stelle (1870); Rev. Joshua Hall, A. E. Law, and\r\nD. F.

Ethnol._) supposes the Etowah mound to be the one\r\nwith a roadway described by Garcilasso de la Vega as being on De Soto’s\r\nroute. Thomas describes other mounds of this group, giving cuts of the\r\nincised copper plates found in them, which he holds to be of European\r\nmake. This forces him to the conclusion that the larger mound was\r\nbuilt before De Soto’s incursion and the others later; and as they\r\ndiffer from those in Carolina, he determines they were not built by the\r\nCherokees.\r\n\r\n[1792] Cf.

B. Warden’s _Recherches sur\r\nles Antiquités de l’Am. Sept._ (Paris, 1827) in _Recueil de Voyages,\r\npublié par la Soc. Géog._ (Paris, 1825, ii. 372; cf.

Including works\r\nin western New York, and portions of other states, together with\r\nstructures in Central America_ (New York, 1880),—a book, however,\r\nhardly to be commended by archæologists; and Charles Francis Keary’s\r\n_Dawn of History, an introduction to prehistoric study_ (N. Y., 1887).\r\n\r\n[1824] It is not necessary to enumerate many titles, but reference\r\nmay be made to the summary of prehistoric conditions in Zerffi’s\r\n_Historical development of art_. It may be worth while to glance at\r\nA. Daux’s _Etudes préhistoriques. L’industrie humaine: ses origines,\r\nses premiers essais et ses légendes depuis les premiers temps jusqu’au\r\ndéluge_ (Paris, 1877); Dawson’s _Fossil men_, ch. 5; Joly’s _Man before\r\nMetals_; Nadaillac’s _Les Premiers Hommes_, ii. ch. 11; Dabry de\r\nThiersant’s _Origine des indiens du Nouveau Monde_ (Paris, 1883); and\r\nBrühl’s _Culturvölker alt-Amerika’s_, ch. 14, 16.\r\n\r\n[1825] Cf., particularly for California, Putnam’s _Report_ in Wheeler’s\r\nSurvey.\r\n\r\n[1826] There is some question if the early Americans ever carried on\r\nthe heavier parts of the quarrying arts, as for building-stones. Cf.\r\nMorgan’s _Houses and House Life_, 274. They did quarry soap-stone\r\n(Elmer R. Reynolds, Schumacher and Putnam, in _Peabody Mus. Repts._,\r\nxii.) and mica (_Smithsonian Report_, 1879, by W. Gesner; C. D. Smith\r\nin _Ibid._ 1876; Dr. Brinton in _Proc. Numism. and Antiq. Soc. of\r\nPhilad._, 1878, p. 18). That they quarried pipe-stone is also well\r\nknown, and the famous red pipe-stone quarry, lying between the Missouri\r\nand Minnesota rivers, was under the protection of the Great Spirit,\r\nso that tribes at war with one another are said to have buried their\r\nhatchets as they approached it. Wilson, in the last chapter of the\r\nfirst volume of his _Prehistoric man_, examines this pipe-carving and\r\ntells the story of this famous quarry. He refers to the tobacco mortars\r\nof the Peruvians in which they ground the dry leaf; and to the pipes\r\nof the mounds in which it was smoked. Cf. J. F. Nadaillac’s _Les pipes\r\net le tabac_ (Paris, 1885), taken from the _Materiaux pour l’histoire\r\nprimitive de l’homme_ (ii. for 1885); and Lucien de Rosny on “Le tabac\r\net ses accessoires parmi les indigènes de l’Amérique,” in _Mémoires sur\r\nl’Archéologie Américaine_, 1865, of the Soc. d’Ethnographie.\r\n\r\n[1827] It should be remembered that the recognition of the Flint-folk\r\nas occupying a distinct stage of development is a modern notion.\r\nFor a century and a half after European museums began to gather\r\nstone implements they were reputed relics of Celtic art. Treatment\r\nof American art necessarily makes part of the works of Squier and\r\nDavis; Schoolcraft; Foster’s _Prehistoric Races_, ch. 6; Lubbock’s\r\n_Prehistoric Times;_ Joly’s _Man before Metals_. Cf. references in\r\n_Poole’s Index_ under “Stone Age” and “Stone Implements.”\r\n\r\n[1828] Cf. S. D. Peet in _Amer. Antiquarian_, vii. 15.\r\n\r\n[1829] Rau is an authority on stone implements. See further his paper\r\non stone implements in the _Smithsonian Rept._, 1872; one on drilling\r\nstone without metal in _Ibid._ 1868; and one on cup-shaped and other\r\nlapidarian sculpture in the _Contributions to No. Amer. Ethnology_,\r\nvol. v. (Powell’s _Rocky Mountain Survey_, 1882). These carved,\r\ncup-like cavities in rocks are also discussed in Wilson’s _Prehistoric\r\nMan_, vol. i. ch. 3, where it is held that they were formed by the\r\ngrinding process in shaping the rounded end of tools. H. W. Henshaw in\r\nthe _Amer. Jour. of Archæology_ (i. 105) discusses another enigma in\r\nthe stone relics, called sinkers or plummets. Foster (_Prehist. Races_,\r\n230) believes they were used as weights to keep the thread taut in\r\nweaving.\r\n\r\n[1830] Cf. also Stevens’s _Flint Chips_, 292, and Charnay, Eng.\r\ntransl., p. 70.\r\n\r\n[1831] Cf. G. Crook “on the Indian method of making arrow-heads” in\r\nthe _Smithsonian Rept._, 1871, and C. C. Jones, Jr., on “the primitive\r\nmanufacture of spear and arrowpoints along the Savannah River” in\r\n_Ibid._ 1879. A paper by Sellers in a later report is of importance.\r\nCf. Stevens’ _Flint Chips_, pp. 75-85, and Schumacher in _Smithsonian\r\nReport_, 1873. True flint was not often, if ever, used in America, but\r\nrather chert or hornstone, and quartz, though implements are found of\r\njasper, chalcedony, obsidian, quartzite, and argillite. Cf. Rau on\r\nthe stock in trade of an aboriginal lapidary in _Smithsonian Rept._\r\n(1877); and Rosny’s “Recherches sur les masques, le jade et l’industrie\r\nlapidaire chez les indigènes de l’Amérique” in _Arch. de la Soc. Amér.\r\nde France_, n. s., vol. i. Jade or jadite implements and ornaments have\r\nbeen found in Central America and Mexico, and others resembling them\r\nin northwestern America; but it is not yet clear that the unworked\r\nmaterial, such as is used in the middle America specimens, is found in\r\nAmerica _in situ_. Upon the solution of this last problem will depend\r\nthe value of these implements when found in America as bearing upon\r\nquestions of Asiatic intercourse. Cf. Dr. A. B. Meyer in the _Amer.\r\nAnthropologist_ (vol. i., July, 1888, p. 231), and F. W. Putnam in the\r\n_Mass. Hist. Soc. Proc._, Jan., 1886, and in the _Proc. Amer. Antiq.\r\nSociety_.\r\n\r\n[1832] Wilson (_Prehistoric Man_, i. 200) points out that philology\r\nconfirms it, the word for copper meaning “yellow stone.” On the\r\nquestion of their melting metal see letter of Prof. F. W. Putnam in\r\n_Kansas City Rev. of Science_, Dec. 1881; Wilson (i. 361); Foster’s\r\n_Prehistoric Races_, 293.\r\n\r\n[1833] Wilson (i. 209, 227) thinks the arboreal and other evidences\r\ncarry the time when these mines were worked back, at latest, to a\r\nperiod corresponding to Europe’s mediæval era. The earliest modern\r\nreferences to copper in this region are in Sagard in 1632 (Haven, p.\r\n127) and in the _Jesuit Relation_ of Allouez in 1666-67. Alexander\r\nHenry (_Travels and Adventures in Canada_) in 1765 is the earliest\r\nEnglish explorer to mention it. Wilson holds to the belief that the\r\npresent race of red Indians had no knowledge of these mining practices,\r\nbut that they knew simply chance masses or exposed lodes. Wilson (i.\r\n362) also gives reasons for supposing that the Lake Superior mines may\r\nhave been a common meeting ground for all races of the continent.\r\n\r\n[1834] Wilson, i. 205. MacLean’s _Moundbuilders_, ch. 6, gives a\r\nsection of the shaft as when discovered.\r\n\r\n[1835] Of the Lake Superior mines, the earliest intelligent account\r\nwe have is in C. T. Jackson’s _Geological Report to the U. S.

The contrary view\r\nis taken by F. von Hochstetter in his _Ueber Mexicanische Reliquien\r\naus der Zeit Montezuma’s_ (Vienna, 1884), who supposes it to have\r\nbeen among the presents sent by Cortes in 1519 to Charles V., in the\r\npossession of whose nephew it is known to have been in 1596.\r\n\r\n[1846] Cf.

Dabry de Thiersant’s _Origine des indiens_\r\n(Paris, 1883), p. 187.\r\n\r\n[1852] It has been a question whether the palæolithic man talked,\r\nand it has been asserted and denied, from the character of certain\r\ninferior maxillary bones found in caves, that he had the power of\r\narticulate speech. Dr. Brinton has recently, from an examination of\r\nthe lowest stocks of linguistic utterances now known, endeavored to\r\nset forth “a somewhat correct conception of what was the character of\r\nthe rudimentary utterances of the race.” Cf. Brinton, _Language of the\r\nPalæolithic Man_, Philadelphia, 1888; Mortillet, _La préhistorique\r\nAntiquité de l’Homme_ (Paris, 1883); H. Steinthal, _Der Ursprung der\r\nSprache_ (Berlin, 1888). Horatio Hale, on “The origin of languages\r\nand the antiquity of speaking man,” in the _Am. Assoc. Adv. Sci.\r\nProc_., xxxv. 279, cites the views of some physiologists to show\r\nthat the pre-glacial man could not talk, because there are only\r\nrudimentary signs of the presence of important vocal muscles to be\r\ndiscovered in the most ancient jaw-bones which have been found. Rau\r\ninferred that the totally diverse character, as he thought, of the\r\nAmerican tongues indicated strongly that the earliest man could\r\nnot articulate (_Contrib. to N. A. Ethnology_, v. 92). For other\r\nsomewhat wild speculations, see Col. E. Carette’s _Etude sur les temps\r\nantéhistoriques, La Langage_ (Paris, 1878).\r\n\r\n[1853] Morgan thought he had found a test in his _Systems of\r\nconsanguinity and affinity of the Human Family_ (Washington, 1871).\r\n\r\n[1854] _Journal Anthropological Inst._, v. 216.\r\n\r\n[1855] _Science of Language_, i. 326.\r\n\r\n[1856] For recognition of it in American philology, see Bancroft, iii.\r\n670, and Short, 471.\r\n\r\n[1857] Cf.

Whitney’s “Testimony of language respecting the\r\nunity of the human race,” in the _North American Review_, July, 1867.\r\n\r\n[1858] The “Lenguas y naciones Americanas” forms part of the first\r\nvolume of Lorenzo Hervas’s _Catálogo de las Lenguas de las Naciones\r\nConocidas, y numeracion, division, y clases de estas segun la\r\ndiversidad de sas idiomas y dialectos_ (Madrid, 1800-1805, in 6 vols.),\r\nwhich served in some measure Johann Severin Vater, and J. C. Adelung in\r\ntheir _Mithridates, oder Allgemeine Sprachenkunde_ (Berlin, 1806-17, in\r\n4 vols.) and his _Analekten der Sprachenkunde_ (Leipzig, 1821).\r\n\r\nThere has more been done so far to map out the ethnological fields of\r\nmiddle America than to determine those of the more northern parts.\r\nCf. the map in Orozco y Berra’s _Geografía de las lenguas de Mexico_\r\n(1864), and that in V. A. Malte-Brun’s paper in the _Compte Rendu,\r\nCong. des Américanistes_, 1877, ii. 10. The maps in Bancroft’s _Native\r\nRaces_, ii. and v., will serve ordinary readers. For the broader\r\nnorthern field, see the papers by L. H. Morgan and George Gibbs in the\r\n_Smithsonian Reports_, 1861, 1862. The Bureau of Ethnology have in\r\npreparation such a map, and they mark on it, it is understood, about\r\nseventy distinct stocks.\r\n\r\nCf. Horatio Hale on “Indian migrations as evidenced by language,” in\r\nthe _Amer. Antiquarian_, v. 18, 108 (Jan., April, 1883), and issued\r\nseparately, Chicago, 1883. Lucien Adam criticised the views of Hall in\r\nthe Copenhagen _Compte Rendu, Cong. des Amér._, 1883, p. 123.\r\n\r\n[1859] _Nat. Races_, iii. 558.\r\n\r\n[1860] Cf. _Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, April, 1879.\r\n\r\n[1861] _Fossil Men_, 310.\r\n\r\n[1862] A prominent feature is the process of uniting words lengthwise,\r\nso to speak, which gives a single utterance the import of a\r\nsentence. This characteristic of the American languages has been\r\ncalled polysynthetic, incorporative, holophrastic, aggregative, and\r\nagglutinative. H. H. Bancroft instances the word for letter-postage\r\nin Aztec as being “Amatlacuilolitquitcatlaxtlahuilli,” which really\r\nsignifies by its component parts, “payment received for carrying a\r\npaper on which something is written.” Cf. Brinton’s _On polysynthesism\r\nand incorporation as characteristic of American languages_ (Philad.,\r\n1885).\r\n\r\n[1863] Hayden says: “The dialects of the western continent, radically\r\nunited among themselves and radically distinguished from all others,\r\nstand in hoary brotherhood by the side of the most ancient vocal\r\nsystems of the human race.”\r\n\r\n[1864] Morgan, in his _Systems of Consanguinity_, contends for this\r\nlinguistic unity, though (in 1866) he admits that “the dialects and\r\nstock languages have not been explored with sufficient thoroughness.”\r\n\r\n[1865] Gallatin says of them: “They bear the impress of primitive\r\nlanguages, ... and attest the antiquity of the population,—an\r\nantiquity the earliest we are permitted to assume.” This was of course\r\nwritten before the geological evidences of the antiquity of man were\r\nunderstood, and the remoteness referred to was a period near the great\r\ndispersion of Babel.\r\n\r\n[1866] The appendix of this work has a good general summary of the\r\nEthnography and Philology of America, by A. H. Keane.\r\n\r\n[1867] The interlinking method of communication between tribes of\r\ndifferent languages is what is called sign or gesture language, and\r\nthe study of it shows that in much the same forms it is spread over\r\nthe continent. It has been specially studied by Col. Garrick Mallery.\r\nCf. his papers in the _Amer. Antiquarian_, ii. 218; _Proc. Amer.\r\nAsso. Adv. Science_, Saratoga meeting, 1880; and at length in the\r\n_First Annual Rept. Bur. of Ethnology_ (1881). He notes his sources of\r\ninformation on pp. 395, 401. He had earlier printed under the Bureau’s\r\nsanction his _Introduction to the Study of Sign Language_ (Washington,\r\n1880). The subject is again considered in the _Third Rept._ of the\r\nBureau, p. xxvi. Cf. also W. P. Clark’s _Indian Sign-language, with\r\nExplanatory Notes_ (Philad., 1885). Morgan (_Systems of Consanguinity_,\r\n227) expresses the opinion that it has the germinal principle “from\r\nwhich came, first, the pictographs of the northern Indians and of the\r\nAztecs; and, secondly, as its ultimate development, the ideographic and\r\npossibly the hieroglyphic language of the Palenqué and Copan monuments.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to languages and dialects, we have a whole body of jargons,\r\na conventional mixture of tongues, adduced by continued intercourse of\r\npeoples speaking different languages. They grew up very early, where\r\nthe French came in contact with the aborigines, and Father Le Jeune\r\nmentions one in 1633 (_Hist. Mag._, v. 345). The Chinook jargon, for\r\ninstance, was, if not invented, at least developed by the Hudson Bay\r\nCompany’s servants, out of French, English, and several Indian tongues\r\n(whose share predominates), to facilitate their trade with the natives,\r\nand does not contain, at an outside limit, more than 400 or 500 words.\r\nThere is some reason to believe that the Indian portion of this jargon\r\nis older, however, than the English contact (Bancroft, iii. 632-3;\r\nGibbs’s _Chinook Dictionary_; Horatio Hale in Wilkes’ _U. S. Explor.\r\nExped._).\r\n\r\n[1868] See the section on “Americana,” with a foot-note on linguistic\r\ncollections. Haven summed up what had been done in this field in 1855\r\nin his _Archæology of the U. S._ p. 53.\r\n\r\n[1869] There is a less extensive survey, but wider in territory, in\r\nShort’s _North Americans of Antiquity_, ch. 10.\r\n\r\n[1870] Vol. III. p. 355.\r\n\r\n[1871] See Pilling’s _Proof-sheets_.\r\n\r\n[1872] Duponceau’s report in Heckewelder, _Hist. Acc. of the Indian\r\nNations_, 1819, is in the _Mass. Hist. Coll._, 1822. Pickering says\r\nthat Duponceau was the earliest to discover and make known the common\r\ncharacteristics of the American tongues.\r\n\r\n[1873] These are enumerated in the appendix of _The Calendar of the\r\nSparks MSS._, issued by the library of Harvard University. They\r\nare also cited with some in other depositories by Pilling in his\r\n_Proof-sheets_.\r\n\r\n[1874] Also in J. B. Scherer’s _Recherches historiques et géographiques\r\nsur le Nouveau Monde_ (Paris, 1777).\r\n\r\n[1875] We know little of what Jefferson might have accomplished, for\r\nhis manuscripts were burned in 1801 (Schoolcraft’s _Ind. Tribes_, ii.\r\n356). As early as 1804 the U. S. War Department issued a list of words,\r\nfor which its agents should get in different tribes the equivalent\r\nwords. Gallatin used these results. Different lists of test words have\r\nbeen often used since. George Gibbs had a list. The Bureau of Ethnology\r\nhas a list.\r\n\r\n[1876] Cf. synopsis in Haven’s _Archæol. U. S._, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[1877] For Hale’s later views see his _Origin of language and antiquity\r\nof speaking man_ (Cambridge, 1886), from the _Proc. Amer. Ass. Adv.\r\nScience_, xxxv.; and his _Development of language_ (Toronto, 1888),\r\nfrom the _Proc. Canadian Inst._, 3d ser., vi.\r\n\r\n[1878] Among other workers in the northern philology may be named\r\nSchoolcraft in his _Indian Tribes_ (ii. and iii. 340), who makes no\r\nadvance upon Gallatin; W. W. Turner in the _Smithsonian Report_, vi.;\r\nR. S. Riggs adds a Dacota bibliography to his _Grammar and Dictionary\r\nof the Dacota language_ (Washington, Smiths. Inst., 1852); George Gibbs\r\nin the _Smithsonian Repts._ for 1865 and 1870, and as collaborator in\r\nother studies, of which record is made in J. A. Stevens’ memoir of\r\nGibbs, first printed in the _N. Y. Hist. Soc. Coll._, and then in the\r\n_Smithsonian Report_ for 1873; F. W. Hayden’s _Contributions to the\r\nethnography and philology of the Indian tribes of the Missouri Valley_\r\n(Philad., 1862), being vol. xiii. of the _Trans. Amer. Philosophical\r\nSoc._\r\n\r\nA contemporary of Gallatin, but a man sorely harassed, as others\r\nsee him, with eccentricities and unstableness of head, was C.\r\nF. Rafinesque, who had nevertheless a certain tendency to acute\r\nobservation, which prevents his books from becoming wholly worthless.\r\nHis first publication was an introduction to Marshall’s _History\r\nof Kentucky_, which he printed separately as _Ancient History, or\r\nAnnals of Kentucky, with a survey of the ancient monuments of North\r\nAmerica, and a tabular view of the principal languages and primitive\r\nnations of the whole earth_ (Frankfort, Ky., 1824). In this he makes a\r\ncomparison of four principal words from fourteen Indian tongues with\r\nthirty-four primitive languages of the old world. In 1836 he printed\r\nat Philadelphia _The American Nations, or outlines of their general\r\nhistory, ancient and modern, including the whole history of the earth\r\nand mankind in the western hemisphere; the philosophy of American\r\nhistory; the annals, traditions, civilization, languages, etc., of all\r\nAmerican nations, tribes, empires and states_ (in two volumes).\r\n\r\n[1879] It embraces:\r\n\r\nFIRST SERIES: No. 1.

Hero Myths_, 60), referring to Father Cuoq’s\r\n_Lexique de la langue Iroquoise_, speaks of that author as “probably\r\nthe best living authority on the Iroquois.” Pilling, _Proof-sheets_,\r\n185, etc., gives the best account of his writings. Cf. Mrs. E. A. Smith\r\non the Iroquois in _Journal Anthropolog. Inst._, xiv. 244.\r\n\r\n[1885] The languages covered are: Dakota, Chibcha, Nahuatl, Kechua,\r\nQuiché, Maya, Montagnais, Chippeway, Algonquin, Cri, Iroquois,\r\nHidatsa, Chacta, Caraïbe, Kiriri, Guarani. Adam has been one of the\r\nleading spirits in the Congrès des Américanistes. There was published\r\nin 1882, as a part of the _Bibliothèque linguistique Américaine, a\r\nGrammaire et Vocabulaire de la langue taensa, avec textes traduits et\r\ncommentés par F. D. Haumonté, Parisot, L. Adam_. It was printed from\r\na manuscript said to have been discovered in 1872, in the library of\r\nMons. Haumonté. Dr. Brinton, finding, as he claimed, that Adam had been\r\nimposed upon, printed in the _American Antiquarian_, March, 1885, “The\r\nTænsa Grammar and Dictionary, a Deception Exposed,” the points of which\r\nwere epitomized by Professor H. W. Haynes in the _American Antiquarian\r\nSociety Proceedings_ (April, 1885), and Adam answered in _Le Tænsa,\r\na-t-il été forgé de toutes pièces_ (Paris, 1885).\r\n\r\nThe languages of the southern and southwestern United States have been\r\nparticularly studied by Albert S. Gatschet, among whose publications\r\nmay be named _Zwölf Sprachen aus dem Südwesten Nord Amerikas_ (Weimar,\r\n1877); _The Timucua language_ of Florida (Philad., 1878, 1880);\r\n_The Chumeto language_ of California (Philad., 1882); _Der Yuma\r\nSprachstamm_ of Arizona and the neighboring regions (Berlin, 1877,\r\n1883); _Wortverzeichniss eines Viti-Dialectes_ (Berlin, 1882); _The\r\nShetimasha Indians of St. Mary’s Parish, Louisiana_ (Washington, 1883);\r\nbut his most important contribution is the linguistic, historic,\r\nand ethnographic introduction to his _Migration Legend of the Creek\r\nIndians_ (Philad., 1884), in which he has surveyed the whole compass of\r\nthe southern Indians. The extent of Mr. Gatschet’s studies will appear\r\nfrom Pilling’s _Proof-sheets_, pp. 285-292, 955.\r\n\r\n[1886] _Contents_.—1. Sur quelques familles de langues du Méxique.\r\n2. Sur différents idiomes de la Nouvelle-Espagne. 3. Sur la\r\nfamille de langues Tapijulapane-Mixe. 4. Sur la famille de langue\r\nPirinda-Othomi. 5.

Sur les signes de numération en Maya.\r\n\r\nPilling (_Proof-sheets_, pp. 145-148, 904-906) enumerates many of the\r\nseparate publications.\r\n\r\n[1887] Brinton has printed _The philosophical grammar of the American\r\nlanguages as set forth by Wilhelm von Humboldt, with a translation of\r\nan unpublished memoir by him on the American verb_ (Philad., 1885).\r\nThe great work of A. von Humboldt and Bonpland, _Voyage aux régions\r\néquinoxiales du nouveau continent_ (Paris, 1816-31), gives some\r\nlinguistic matter in the third volume.\r\n\r\n[1888] These are enumerated in the list in Bancroft, i.; in Field,\r\nnos. 208-218; and in Leclerc, _Index_; with more detail in Pilling’s\r\n_Proof-sheets_, pp. 102-110, 894-896. Cf. also Sabin, iii. nos. 9,521\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[1889] Brinton, who possesses his papers, published a Memoir of him in\r\nthe _Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, 1884. His publications and MS. collections\r\nare given in Pilling’s _Proof-sheets_, PP. 72, 73, 879-881.\r\n\r\n[1890] He cites (iii. 725-26) many opinions; and quotes Sahagún as\r\nsaying that the Apalaches were Nahuas and spoke the Mexican tongue\r\n(_Ibid_. iii. 727). Is this any evidence of the Floridian immigration?\r\n\r\n[1891] A considerable body of literature in this language has come\r\ndown to us. Bancroft (iii. 728) enumerates a number of the principal\r\nreligious manuals, etc. Icazbalceta in the first volume of his\r\n_Bibliografia Mexicana_ (Mexico, 1886), in cataloguing the books issued\r\nin Mexico before 1600, includes all that were printed in the native\r\ntongue. Brinton gives some account of such native authors in his\r\n_Aboriginal American authors and their productions, especially those in\r\nthe native languages. A chapter in the history of literature_ (Philad.,\r\n1883). Cf. his paper in the _Congrès des Amér._, Copenhagen, 1883, p.\r\n54. Bancroft (iii. 730) gives some citations as to its literary value.\r\nBrinton has illustrated this quality in some of his lesser monographs,\r\nas in his _Ancient Nahuatl Poetry_ (Philad., 1887); and in his _Study\r\nof the Nahuatl language_ (1886), in which he gives specimens and\r\nenumerates the dictionaries and texts. He says there are more than a\r\nhundred authors in it (_Amer. Antiquarian_, viii. 22). Icazbalceta has\r\ncollected many Nahua MSS., and his brother-in-law, Francisco Pimentel,\r\nhas used them in his _Cuadro descriptivo y comparativo de las Lenguas\r\nindigenas de México_ (1862), of which there is a German translation\r\nby Isidor Epstein (N. Y., 1877). This is based on a second augmented\r\nedition (Mexico, 1874-75), in which the tongues of northern Mexico\r\nare better represented, and a general classification of the languages\r\nis added. Pimentel (i. 154) asserts that it is a mistake to suppose\r\nthat the Chichimecs spoke Nahua. Cf., however, Bancroft (iii. 724) and\r\nShort, 255, 480. Pimentel’s opinions are weighty, and follow in this\r\nrespect those of Orozco y Berra, Sahagún, Ixtlilxochitl; but later,\r\nVeytia had maintained the reverse.\r\n\r\nLucien Adam includes the Nahua in his _Etudes sur six langues\r\nAméricaines_ (Paris, 1878). Aubin wrote “Sur la langue Méxicaine et la\r\nphilologie Américaine” in the _Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France_, n.\r\ns., vol. i. Brasseur contributed various articles on Mexican philology\r\nto the _Revue Orientale et Américaine_. Dr. C. Hermann Berendt formed\r\nan _Analytical Alphabet for the Mexican and Central America languages_\r\n(N. Y., 1869). Buschmann has a study in the _Mémoirs de l’Académie de\r\nBerlin_, and separately, _Ueber die Astekischen Ortsnamen_ (Berlin,\r\n1853). Henri de Charencey in his _Mélanges de Philologie_ (Paris,\r\n1883) has a paper “Sur quelques familles de langues du Méxique.” V.\r\nA. Malte-Brun gave in the _Compte Rendu, Cong. des Américanistes_,\r\n1877 (vol. ii. p. 10), a paper “La distribution ethnographique des\r\nnations et des langues au Méxique.” Reference has been made elsewhere\r\nto the important publication of Manuel Orozco y Berra, _Geografia\r\nde las lenguas y carta etnográfica de México, precedidos de un\r\nensayo de classificacion de las mismas lenguas y de apuntes para las\r\ninmigraciones de las tribus_ (Mexico, 1864). The work is said to be\r\nthe fruit of twelve years’ constant study, and to have been based in\r\nsome part on MSS. belonging to Icazbalceta, dating back to the latter\r\npart of the sixteenth century (enumerated in _Peab. Mus. Repts._, ii.\r\n559). There is some adverse criticism. Peschel (_Races of Men_, 438)\r\nthinks the linguistic map of Mexico in Orozco y Berra’s work the only\r\ngood feature in the book, since the author spreads old errors anew\r\nin consequence of his unacquaintance with Buschmann’s researches. A\r\nseries of linguistic monographic essays on the Aztec names of places\r\nis embraced in Dr. Antonio Peñafiel’s _Nombres Geografico de Mexico.\r\nCatalogo alfabetico de los nombres de lugar pertenecientes al idioma\r\n“Nahuatl” estudio jeroglifico de la matricula de los tributos del\r\ncodice Mendocino_ (Mexico, 1885). In the _Archives de la Soc. Amér.\r\nde France_, n. s., 179, iii. there is an essay by Siméon, “La langue\r\nMéxicaine et son histoire.”\r\n\r\nThe affiliation of the Aztec with the Pueblo stocks is traced\r\nby Bancroft, iii. 665, who follows out the diversities of those\r\nstocks (pp. 671, 681). Cf. for various views Morgan’s _Systems\r\nof Consanguinity_, 260; Buschmann’s _Die Völker und Sprachen Neu\r\nMexico’s_, and _First Rept. Bur. of Ethnology_, p. xxxi.\r\n\r\n[1892] Some authorities give fourteen dialects of the Maya. Cf. the\r\ntable in Bancroft, iii. 562, etc., and the statements in Garcia y\r\nCubas, translated by Geo. F. Henderson as _The Republic of Mexico_.\r\nIt is still spoken in the greatest purity about the Balize, as is\r\ncommonly said; but Le Plongeon goes somewhat inland and says he found\r\nit “in all its pristine purity” in the neighborhood of Lake Peten. Le\r\nPlongeon, with that extravagance which has in the end deprived him of\r\nthe sympathy and encouragement due to his noteworthy labors, says, “One\r\nthird of this Maya tongue is pure Greek,” following Brasseur in one of\r\nhis vagaries, who thought he found in 15,000 Maya vocables at least\r\n7,000 that bore a striking resemblance to the language of Homer.\r\n\r\n[1893] The bibliographies will add to this enumeration. The _Pinart\r\nCatalogue_ (pp. 98-100) gives a partial list. Only some of the more\r\nimportant monographs upon features of the Maya language can be\r\nmentioned: Father Pedro Beltran de Santa Rosa’s _Arte del idioma Maya_\r\n(Mexico, 1746) was so rare that Brasseur did not secure it, but Leclerc\r\ncatalogues it (no. 2,280), as well as the reprint (Merida, 1859) edited\r\nby José D. Espinosa. There is a study of the Maya tongues included\r\nin a paper printed first by Carl Hermann Berendt in the _Journal of\r\nthe Amer. Geog. Soc._ (viii. 132, for 1876), which was later issued\r\nseparately as _Remarks on the centres of ancient civilization in\r\nCentral America and their geographical distribution_ (N. Y., 1876).\r\nIt is accompanied by a map. (Cf. also his “Explorations in Central\r\nAmerica” in the _Smithsonian Rept._, 1867.) Brasseur included in his\r\n_Manuscrit Troano_ (Paris, 1869-70), and later published separately, a\r\n_Dictionnaire, Grammaire et Chrestomathie de la langue Maya_ (Paris,\r\n1872); the dictionary containing 10,000 words, the grammar being\r\na translation from Father Gabriel de Saint Bonaventure, while the\r\nchrestomathy was a gathering of specimens ancient and modern, of the\r\nlanguage. Brasseur, in his mutable way, found in the first season\r\nof his studies the Greek, Latin, English, German, Scandinavian, not\r\nto name others, to have correspondences with the Maya, and ended in\r\nderiving them from that tongue as the primitive language. (Cf. Short,\r\n476.) Dr. Brinton has a paper on _The Ancient Phonetic Alphabet of\r\nYucatan_ (N. Y., 1870), and he read at the Buffalo meeting (1886) of\r\nthe Amer. Assoc. for the Advancement of Science a paper on the phonetic\r\nelement of the graphic system of the Mayas, etc., which is printed in\r\nthe _American Antiquarian_, viii. 347. In the introduction of his _Maya\r\nChronicles_ (Philad., 1882) he examines the language and literature of\r\nthe Mayas. He refers to a “Disertacion sobre la historia de la lengua\r\nMaya o Yucateca” by Crescencio Carrello y Ancona in the _Revista de\r\nMerida_, 1870. Charencey has printed various special papers, like a\r\n_Fragment de Chrestomathie de la langue Maya antique_ (Paris, 1875)\r\nfrom the _Revue de Philologie et d’Ethnographie_, and a paper read\r\nbefore the Copenhagen meeting of the Congrès des Américanistes (_Compte\r\nRendu_, p. 379), “De la formation des mots en lengua Maya.” Landa’s\r\n_Relation_ as published by Brasseur (Paris, 1864) is of course a\r\nleading source.\r\n\r\nOf the Quiché branch of the Maya we know most from Brasseur’s _Popul\r\nVuh_ and from his _Gramatica de la lengua Quiché_ (Paris, 1862), in\r\nthe appendix of which he printed the _Rabinal Achi_, a drama in the\r\nQuiché tongue. Father Ildefonso José Flores, a native of the country,\r\nwas professor of the Cakchiquel language in the university of Guatemala\r\nin the last century, and published a _Arte de la lengua metropolitana\r\ndel Reyno Cakchiquel_ (Guatemala, 1753), which was unknown to later\r\nscholars, till Brasseur discovered a copy in 1856 (Leclerc, no.\r\n2,270). The literature of the Cakchiquel dialect is examined in\r\nthe introduction to Brinton’s _Grammar of the Cakchiquel language_\r\n(Philad., 1884), edited for the American Philosophical Society. Cf.\r\nBrinton’s little _treatise On the language and ethnologic position of\r\nthe Xinca Indians of Guatemala_ (Philadelphia, 1884); his _So-called\r\nAlaguilac language of Guatemala_ in the _Proc. Am. Philosoph. Soc._,\r\n1887, p. 366; and Otto Stoll’s _Zur Ethnographie der Republik\r\nGuatemala_ (Zurich, 1884).\r\n\r\nWe owe to Brinton, also, a few discussions of the Nicaragua tongues,\r\nboth in their Maya and Aztec relations. He has discussed the local\r\ndialect of this region in the introduction of _The Güegüence; a comedy\r\nballet in the Nahuatl-Spanish dialect of Nicaragua_ (Philadelphia,\r\n1883), and in his _Notes on the Mangue, an extinct dialect formerly\r\nspoken in Nicaragua_ (Philadelphia, 1886).\r\n\r\n[1894] Notwithstanding this commonness of origin, if such be the case,\r\nthere is a striking truth in what Max Müller says: “The thoughts of\r\nprimitive humanity were not only different from our thoughts, but\r\ndifferent also from what we think their thoughts ought to have been.”\r\n\r\n[1895] See Vol. IV. p. 295.\r\n\r\n[1896] Such are Sagard’s _Histoire du Canada_ (1636); Nicolas Perrot’s\r\n_Mémoire sur les Mœurs, Coutumes et Religion des Sauvages_, involving\r\nhis experience from 1665 to 1699; Lafitau’s _Mœurs des Sauvages_\r\n(1724), and the like.\r\n\r\n[1897] Bancroft (iii. 136) says: “It does not appear, notwithstanding\r\nMr. Squier’s assertion to the contrary, that the serpent was actually\r\nworshipped either in Yucatan or Mexico.” Cf. Brinton’s _Myths_, ch. 4;\r\nChas. S. Wake’s _Serpent Worship_ (London, 1888); and J. G. Bourke’s\r\n_Snake-dance of the Moquis of Arizona; being a narrative of a journey\r\nfrom Santa Fé, New Mexico, to the villages of the Moqui Indians of\r\nArizona, with a description of the manners and customs of this peculiar\r\npeople, to which is added a brief dissertation upon serpent-worship in\r\ngeneral, with an account of the tablet dance of the Pueblo of Santo\r\nDomingo, New Mexico, etc._ (London, 1884).\r\n\r\n[1898] Brinton (_Myths_, etc., 141) declares sun-worship, which some\r\ninvestigators have made the base of all primitive religions, to be but\r\na “short and easy method with mythology,” and that “no one key can\r\nopen all the arcana of symbolism.” He refers to D’Orbigny (_L’Homme\r\nAméricain_), Müller (_Amer. Urreligionen_), and Squier (_Serpent\r\nSymbol_) as supporting the opposing view. We may find like supporters\r\nof the sun as a central idea in Schoolcraft, Tylor, Brasseur. Cf.\r\nBancroft’s _Native Races_ (iii. 114) in opposition to Brinton.\r\n\r\n[1899] This monotheism is denied by Brinton (_Myths of the New\r\nWorld_, 52). “Of monotheism, either as displayed in the one personal\r\ndefinite God of the Semitic races, or in the dim pantheistic sense\r\nof the Brahmins, there was not a single instance on the American\r\ncontinent,”—the Iroquois “Neu” and “Hawaneu,” which, as Brinton says,\r\nhave deceived Morgan and others, being but the French “Dieu” and “Le\r\nbon Dieu” rendered in Indian pronunciation (_Myths of the New World_,\r\np. 53). The aborigines instituted, however, in two instances, the\r\nworship of an immaterial god, one among the Quichuas of Peru and\r\nanother at Tezcuco (_Ibid._ p. 55).\r\n\r\nBandelier (_Archæol. Tour_, 185), examining the _Hist. de los Méxicanos\r\npor sus Pinturas_ (_Anales del Museo_, ii. 86), Motolinía, Gómara,\r\nSahagún, Tobar, and Durán, finds no trace of monotheism till we come\r\nto Acosta. Torquemada speaks of supreme _gods_; and Bandelier thinks\r\nthat Ixtlilxochitl, in conveying the idea of a single god, evidently\r\ndistorts and disfigures Torquemada.\r\n\r\nBancroft (iii. 198) accords honesty to Ixtlilxochitl’s account of the\r\nreligion of the Tezcucan ruler Nezahualcoyotl, as reaching the heights\r\nof Mexican monotheistic conception, because he thinks his descendants,\r\nif he had fabled, would never have ended his description with so pagan\r\na statement as that which makes the Tezcucan recognize the sun as his\r\nfather and the earth as his mother.\r\n\r\nMax Müller tells us that we should distinguish between monotheism and\r\nhenotheism, which is the temporary preeminence of one god over the host\r\nof gods, and which was as near monotheism as the American aborigines\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n[1900] He also masses the evidence which shows, as he thinks, that\r\n“on Catholic missions has followed the debasement, and on Protestant\r\nmissions the destruction, of the Indian race.” _Amer. Hero-Myths_, pp.\r\n206, 238.\r\n\r\n[1901] Unfortunately, Brinton enforces this view and others with a\r\ndegree of confidence that does not help him to convince the cautious\r\nreader, as when he speaks of the opinions of those who disagree with\r\nhim as “having served long enough as the last refuge of ignorance”\r\n(_Amer. Hero-Myths_, 145).\r\n\r\n[1902] The whole question of comparative mythology involves in its\r\nbroad aspects the subject of American myths. The literature of this\r\ngeneral kind is large, but reference may be made to Girard de Rialle’s\r\n_La Mythologie Comparée_ (Paris, 1878); for the idea of God, Dawson’s\r\n_Fossil Men_, ch. 9 and 10; Lubbock’s _Origin of Civilization_, ch. 4,\r\n5, 6; J. P. Lesley’s _Man’s origin and destiny_, ch. 10; and for the\r\ngeographical distribution of myths, Tylor’s _Early Hist. of Mankind_,\r\nch. 12; Max Müller’s _Chips_, vol. ii.; and in a general way, Brinton’s\r\n_Religious sentiment, its source and aim_ (N. Y., 1876). Reference may\r\nalso be made to Joly’s _Man before Metals_, ch. 7; Dabry de Thiersant’s\r\n_Origine des indiens_ (Paris, 1883); and G. Brühl’s _Culturvölker\r\nAlt-Amerikas_ (Cincinnati, 1876-78), ch. 10 and 19. Brinton (_Myths_,\r\n210) tracks the Deluge myth among the Indians, and Bancroft gives many\r\ninstances of it (_Native Races_, v., index). Brinton thinks a paper by\r\nCharencey, “Le Déluge d’après les traditions indiennes de l’Amérique\r\ndu Nord,” in the _Revue Américaine_, a help for its extracts, but\r\ncomplains of its uncritical spirit.\r\n\r\nWe find sufficient data of the aboriginal belief in the future life\r\nboth in Bancroft’s final chapter (vol. iii. part i.) and in Brinton’s\r\n_Myths_, ch. 9. Brinton delivered an address on the “Journey of the\r\nsoul,” which is printed in the _Proceedings_ (Jan., 1883) of the\r\nNumismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[1903] In studying the mythology of these tribes we must depend mainly\r\non confined monographs. Mrs. E. A. Smith treats the myths of the\r\nIroquois in the _Second Annual Rept. Bureau of Ethnology_. Charles\r\nGodfrey Leland has covered _The Algonquin legends of New England;\r\nor, myths and folk-lore of the Micmac, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscot\r\ntribes_ (Boston, 1884). Brinton has a book on _The Lenâpé and their\r\nlegends_ (Philad., 1885); and one may refer to the _Life and Journals\r\nof David Brainard_. S. D. Peet has a paper on “The religious beliefs\r\nand traditions of the aborigines of North America” in the _Journal\r\nof the Victoria Institute_ (London, 1888, vol. xxi. 229); one on\r\n“Animal worship and Sun worship in the east and west compared” in the\r\n_American Antiquarian_, Mar., 1888; and a paper on the religion of the\r\nmoundbuilders in _Ibid._ vi. 393. The _Dahcotah, or life and legends\r\nof the Sioux around Fort Snelling_ (N. Y., 1849) of Mrs. Mary Eastman\r\nhas been a serviceable book. S. R. Riggs covers the mythology of the\r\nDakotas in the _Amer. Antiquarian_ (v. 147), and in this periodical\r\nwill be found various studies concerning other tribes.\r\n\r\n[1904] Bandelier, _Archæol. Tour_, 185, calls it the earliest statement\r\nof the Nahua mythology.\r\n\r\n[1905] There is more or less of original importance on the Aztec myths\r\nin Alfredo Chavero’s “La Piedra del Sol,” likewise in the _Anales_\r\n(vol. i.). Cf. also the “Ritos Antiguos, sacrificios e idolatrias de\r\nlos indios de la Nueva España,” as printed in the _Coleccion de doc.\r\nined. para la hist. de España_ (liii. 300).\r\n\r\nBancroft (vol. iii. ch. 6-10), who is the best source for reference,\r\ngives also the best compassed survey of the entire field; but among\r\nwriters in English he may be supplemented by Prescott (i. ch. 3,\r\nintrod.); Helps in his _Spanish Conquest_ (vol. ii.); Tylor’s\r\n_Primitive Culture_; Albert Réville’s _Lectures on the origin and\r\ngrowth of religion as illustrated by the native religions of Mexico and\r\nPeru_, translated by P. H. Wicksteed (London, 1884, being the Hibbert\r\nlectures for 1884); on the analogies of the Mexican belief, a condensed\r\nstatement in Short’s _No. America of Antiq._, 459; a popular paper in\r\n_The Galaxy_, May, 1876. Bandelier intended a fourth paper to be added\r\nto the three printed in the _Peabody Mus. Repts._ (vol. ii.), namely,\r\none on “The Creeds and Beliefs of the Ancient Mexicans,” which has\r\nnever, I think, been printed.\r\n\r\nAmong the French, we may refer to Ternaux-Compans’ _Essai sur la\r\nthéogonie Méxicaine_ (Paris, 1840) and the works of Brasseur. Klemm’s\r\n_Cultur-Geschichte_ and Müller’s _Urreligionen_ will mainly cover the\r\nGerman views. Of the Mexican writers, it may be worth while to name\r\nJ. M. Melgar’s _Examen comparativa entre los signos simbolicos de las\r\nTeogonias y Cosmogonias antiguas y los que existen en los manuscritos\r\nMéxicanos_ (Vera Cruz, 1872).\r\n\r\nThe readiest description of their priesthood and festivals will be\r\nfound in Bancroft (ii. 201, 303, with references). Tenochtitlan is said\r\nto have had 2,000 sacred buildings, and Torquemada says there were\r\n80,000 throughout Mexico; while Clavigero says that a million priests\r\nattended upon them. Bancroft (iii. ch. 10) describes this service.\r\nThere is a chance in all this of much exaggeration.\r\n\r\nThe history of human sacrifice as a part of this service is the subject\r\nof disagreement among the earlier as well as with the later writers.\r\nBancroft (iii. 413, 442) gives some leading references. Cf. Prescott\r\n(i. 77) and Nadaillac (p. 296). Las Casas in his general defence of the\r\nnatives places the number of sacrifices very low. Zumárraga says there\r\nwere 20,000 a year. The Aztecs, if not originating the practice, as is\r\ndisputed by some, certainly made much use of it.\r\n\r\n[1906] _Anales del Museo Nacional_, ii. 247; Bancroft, iii. 240, 248.\r\n\r\n[1907] Bandelier thinks Durán the earliest to connect St. Thomas with\r\nQuetzalcoatl. Cf. Bancroft, iii. 456.\r\n\r\n[1908] Müller agrees with Ixtlilxochitl that Quetzalcoatl and Huemac\r\nwere one and the same, and that Ternaux erred in supposing them\r\nrespectively Olmec and Toltec deities. Cf. Brasseur’s _Palenqué_, 40,\r\n66. Cf. D. Daly on “Quetzalcoatl, the Mexican Messiah” in _Gentleman’s\r\nMag._, n. a., xli. 236.\r\n\r\n[1909] For the later views in general see Clavigero, Tylor, Brasseur\r\n(_Nations Civil._, i. 253), Prescott (i. 62), Bancroft (iii. 248, 263;\r\nv. 24, 200, 255, 257), and Short (267, 274).\r\n\r\n[1910] The god Paynal was a sort of deputy war-god. See H. H.\r\nBancroft’s _Native Races_.\r\n\r\n[1911] Cf. references in _Peabody Mus.

Winthrop, which is printed by this society,\r\nand is also contained, with a statement of the occasion of it, in his\r\n_Speeches and Addresses_, 1878-1886.

Waldo Higginson’s _Memorials of the Class of 1833, Harvard\r\nCollege_, p. 60, and the contemporary tributes from eminent associates\r\nnoted in _Poole’s Index_, p. 1434.\r\n\r\n[1925] The documentary history, by W. J. Rhees, of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, forms vol. xvii. of its _Miscellaneous Collections_. Cf.\r\nJ. Henry on its organization in the _Proceedings_ of the Amer. Asso.\r\nfor the Adv. of Science, vol. i. A _Catalogue of the publications of\r\nthe S. I. with an alphabetical index of articles_, by William J. Rhees\r\n(Washington, 1882), constitutes no. 478 of its series.\r\n\r\nThe early management of the Smithsonian decided that the “knowledge”\r\nof its founder meant science, and from the start gave not a little\r\nattention to archæology as a science. When the Bureau of Ethnology\r\nbecame a part of the Institution, and its _Reports_ included papers\r\nnecessarily historical as well as archæological, the way was prepared\r\nfor a broader meaning to the term “knowledge,” and as a significant\r\nrecognition of the allied field of research the present government of\r\nthe Smithsonian gave hearty concurrence to the act of Congress which in\r\nDec., 1888, made also the American Historical Association, which had\r\nexisted without incorporation since 1884, a section of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution.\r\n\r\n[1926] Its mound explorations have been conducted by Cyrus Thomas;\r\nthose among the Pueblos of the southwest by James Stevenson (d.\r\n1888); while Major Powell himself has controlled personally the body\r\nof searchers in the linguistic fields (_American Antiquarian_, viii.\r\n32). It would seem that its profession “to organize anthropological\r\nresearch” is not to its full extent true, since the physiological side\r\nof the subject seems to be left in Washington to the Army Medical\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n[1927] Cf. Charles Rau’s _Archæological Collections of the United\r\nStates National Museum_ (1876) in _Smithsonian Contributions_, xx.,\r\nwith many illustrative woodcuts; and a paper by Ernest Ingersoll in\r\n_The Century_, January, 1885. Cf. also F. W. Putnam’s contribution on\r\nAmerican Archæological Collections in the _American Naturalist_, vii.\r\n29.\r\n\r\n[1928] B. P. Poore’s _Descriptive Catal. Govt. Pub._, p. 593; Field’s\r\n_Ind. Bibliog._, no. 1379; Allibone’s _Dictionary_, iii. p. 1952,\r\nfor references and opposing criticisms. Some of the condemnation of\r\nthe book is too sweeping, for amid its ignorance, confusion, and\r\nindiscrimination there is much to be picked out which is of importance.\r\nCf. Parkman’s _Jesuits_, p. lxxx; Wilson’s _Prehistoric Man_, ii.\r\nch. 19; Brinton’s _Myths_, p. 40. Cf. on Schoolcraft’s death (with a\r\nportrait) _Historical Mag._, April, 1865; _Amer. Antiq. Soc. Proc._,\r\nApril, 1865.\r\n\r\nF. S. Drake’s _Indian Tribes of the United States_ (Philad., 1884)\r\nis, with some additional matter, a rearrangement of Schoolcraft, the\r\nomission to acknowledge which on the title-page being an unworthy\r\nbibliographical deceit. Schoolcraft’s rivalry of Geo. Catlin and his\r\nignoring of Catlin’s work is commented on at some length by Donaldson\r\nin the _Smithsonian Inst. Report_, 1885, part ii. pp. 373-383.\r\n\r\n[1929] For full details of this and other publications mentioned in\r\nthis paper, see S. H. Scudder’s _Catalogue of Scientific Serials,\r\n1633-1876_, published by the library of Harvard University in 1879.\r\n\r\n[1930] Sabin, xvii., no. 70354. The Congrès Archéologique de France\r\nbegan its Séances générales in 1834, but the interest of its _Comptes\r\nrendus_ for Americanists is for comparative illustration. The two\r\nvolumes of _Mémoires de la Société Ethnologique_ (Paris, 1841-45)\r\ncontain nothing bearing directly on American archæology. Much the same\r\nmay be said of the _Annales Archéologiques fondées par Didron aîné_, in\r\n1844, and continued to 1870; of the _Bulletin Archéologique_ (1844-46)\r\nof the Athénæum Français, and of its continuation, the _Bulletin\r\nArchéologique Français_ (1846-56); and of the _Annales_ of the Institut\r\nArchéologique (1844, etc.).\r\n\r\n[1931] _Am. Antiq. Soc. Proc._, April, 1876.\r\n\r\n[1932] A _Revue Ethnographique_ was begun in 1869. A Societé\r\nEthnologique, publishing _Bulletin_ (1846-47) and _Mémoires_ (1841-45),\r\nis a distinct organization.\r\n\r\n[1933] S. H. Scudder, in his _Catalogue of Scientific Serials_,\r\nno. 1528, endeavors to put into something like orderly arrangement\r\nthe exceedingly devious devices of duplication of this and allied\r\npublications.\r\n\r\n[1934] A _Revue d’Anthropologie_ was begun at Paris, under the\r\ndirection of Broca, in 1872. A Société d’Anthropologie began two\r\nseries, _Bulletins_ and _Mémoires_, in 1860. Mortillet conducted\r\n_L’Homme_ from 1883 to 1887, when he and his associates in this work\r\nsuspended its publication to devote themselves to a _Dictionnaire des\r\nSciences Anthropologiques_ and to a _Bibliothèque Anthropologique_.\r\n\r\n[1935] Rosny died April 23, 1871.\r\n\r\n[1936] Its publications began in 1665. Cf. synopsis in Scudder’s\r\n_Catalogue_, pp. 26-27. Cf. C. A. Alexander on the origin and history\r\nof the Royal Society, in _Smithsonian Rept._, 1863.\r\n\r\n[1937] Some of the local societies deal to some extent in American\r\nsubjects; _e. g._, the _Journal of the Manchester Geographical\r\nSociety_, begun in 1885.\r\n\r\n[1938] Not to be confounded with _The Ethnological Journal_, vol.\r\ni., 1848-49, and vol. ii., 1854, incomplete; and _The Ethnological\r\nJournal_, 1 vol., 1865-66.\r\n\r\n[1939] Cf. J. R. Bartlett on an Antwerp meeting, in _Amer. Antiq. Soc.\r\nProc._, 1868.\r\n\r\n[1940] Such periodicals as _Nature_ and _Popular Science Review_ show\r\nhow anthropological science is attracting attention.\r\n\r\n[1941] See Scudder’s _Catalogue_.\r\n\r\n[1942] The third volume of Bastian’s _Culturländer des Alten America_\r\n(Berlin, 1886) comprises “Nachträge und Ergänzungen aus den Sammlungen\r\ndes Ethnologischen Museums.”\r\n\r\n[1943] _Congrès des Américanistes, Compte Rendus_, Nancy, ii. 271.\r\n\r\n[1944] Cf.

Henry Phillips, Jr.\r\n(_Proc. Amer. Philosophical Soc._, xxi. p. 111) gives a list of public\r\ncollections of American Archæology. There are some private collections\r\nmentioned in the _Archives de la Soc. Amér. de France, Nouv. Ser._,\r\nvol. i. A. de Longperier’s _Notice des Monuments dans la Salle des\r\nAntiquités Américaines_ (Paris, 1880) covers a part of the great\r\nParis exhibition of that year. Something is found in E. T. Stevens’s\r\n_Flint Chips, a guide to prehistoric archæology as illustrated in the\r\nBlackmore Museum_ [at Salisbury, England], London, 1870.\r\n\r\n[1946] There is an account of Mendoza in the _Amer.
