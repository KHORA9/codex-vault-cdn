The following attempt at a “History of Signboards” may be\r\ndeemed the result of an exploration in one of these by-ways.\r\n\r\nAlthough from the days of Addison’s _Spectator_ down to the present time\r\nmany short articles have been written upon house-signs, nothing like a\r\ngeneral inquiry into the subject has, as yet, been published in this\r\ncountry. The extraordinary number of examples and the numerous absurd\r\ncombinations afforded such a mass of entangled material as doubtless\r\ndeterred writers from proceeding beyond an occasional article in a\r\nmagazine, or a chapter in a book,--when only the more famous signs would\r\nbe cited as instances of popular humour or local renown. How best to\r\nclassify and treat the thousands of single and double signs was the\r\nchief difficulty in compiling the present work. That it will in every\r\nrespect satisfy the reader is more than is expected--indeed much more\r\nthan could be hoped for under the best of circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn these modern days, the signboard is a very unimportant object: it was\r\nnot always so. At a time when but few persons could read and write,\r\nhouse-signs were indispensable in city life. As education spread they\r\nwere less needed; and when in the last century, the system of numbering\r\nhouses was introduced, and every thoroughfare had its name painted at\r\nthe beginning and end, they were no longer a positive necessity--their\r\noriginal value was gone, and they lingered on, not by reason of their\r\nusefulness, but as instances of the decorative humour of our ancestors,\r\nor as advertisements of established reputation and business success. For\r\nthe names of many of our streets we are indebted to the sign of the old\r\ninn or public-house, which frequently was the first building in the\r\nstreet--commonly enough suggesting its erection, or at least a few\r\nhouses by way of commencement. The huge “London Directory” contains the\r\nnames of hundreds of streets in the metropolis which derived their\r\ntitles from taverns or public-houses in the immediate neighbourhood. As\r\nmaterial for the etymology of the names of persons and places, the\r\nvarious old signs may be studied with advantage. In many other ways the\r\nhistoric importance of house-signs could be shown.\r\n\r\nSomething like a classification of our subject was found absolutely\r\nnecessary at the outset, although from the indefinite nature of many\r\nsigns the divisions “Historic,” “Heraldic,” “Animal,” &c.--under which\r\nthe various examples have been arranged--must be regarded as purely\r\narbitrary, for in many instances it would be impossible to say whether\r\nsuch and such a sign should be included under the one head or under the\r\nother. The explanations offered as to origin and meaning are based\r\nrather upon conjecture and speculation than upon fact--as only in very\r\nrare instances reliable data could be produced to bear them out.\r\nCompound signs but increase the difficulty of explanation: if the road\r\nwas uncertain before, almost all traces of a pathway are destroyed here.\r\nWhen, therefore, a solution is offered, it must be considered only as a\r\nsuggestion of the _possible_ meaning. As a rule, and unless the symbols\r\nbe very obvious, the reader would do well to consider the _majority_ of\r\ncompound signs as quarterings or combinations of others, without any\r\nhidden signification. A double signboard has its parallel in commerce,\r\nwhere for a common advantage, two merchants will unite their interests\r\nunder a double name; but as in the one case so in the other, no rule\r\nbesides the immediate interests of those concerned can be laid down for\r\nsuch combinations.\r\n\r\nA great many signs, both single and compound, have been omitted. To have\r\nincluded all, together with such particulars of their history as could\r\nbe obtained, would have required at least half-a-dozen folio volumes.\r\nHowever, but few signs of any importance are known to have been omitted,\r\nand care has been taken to give fair samples of the numerous varieties\r\nof the compound sign. As the work progressed a large quantity of\r\nmaterial accumulated for which no space could be found, such as “A\r\nproposal to the House of Commons for raising above half a million of\r\nmoney per annum, _with a great ease to the subject_, by a TAX upon\r\nSIGNS, London, 1695,” a very curious tract; a political _jeu-d’esprit_\r\nfrom the Harleian MSS., (5953,) entitled “_The Civill Warres of the\r\nCitie_,” a lengthy document prepared for a journal in the reign of\r\nWilliam of Orange by one “E. I.,” and giving the names and whereabouts\r\nof the principal London signs at that time. Acts of Parliament for the\r\nremoval or limitation of signs; and various religious pamphlets upon the\r\nsubject, such as “Helps for Spiritual Meditation, earnestly Recommended\r\nto the Perusal of all those who desire to have their Hearts much with\r\nGod,” a chap-book of the time of Wesley and Whitfield, in which the\r\nexisting “Signs of London are Spiritualized, with an Intent, that when a\r\nperson walks along the Street, instead of having their Mind fill’d with\r\nVanity, and their Thoughts amus’d with the trifling Things that\r\ncontinually present themselves, they may be able to Think of something\r\nProfitable.”\r\n\r\nAnecdotes and historical facts have been introduced with a double view;\r\nfirst, as authentic proofs of the existence and age of the sign;\r\nsecondly, in the hope that they may afford variety and entertainment.\r\nThey will call up many a picture of the olden time; many a trait of\r\nbygone manners and customs--old shops and residents, old modes of\r\ntransacting business, in short, much that is now extinct and obsolete.\r\nThere is a peculiar pleasure in pondering over these old houses, and\r\npicturing them to ourselves as again inhabited by the busy tenants of\r\nformer years; in meeting the great names of history in the hours of\r\nrelaxation, in calling up the scenes which must have been often\r\nwitnessed in the haunt of the pleasure-seeker,--the tavern with its\r\nnoisy company, the coffee-house with its politicians and smart beaux;\r\nand, on the other hand, the quiet, unpretending shop of the ancient\r\nbookseller filled with the monuments of departed minds. Such scraps of\r\nhistory may help to picture this old London as it appeared during the\r\nlast three centuries. For the contemplative mind there is some charm\r\neven in getting at the names and occupations of the former inmates of\r\nthe houses now only remembered by their signs; in tracing, by means of\r\nthese house decorations, their modes of thought or their ideas of\r\nhumour, and in rescuing from oblivion a few little anecdotes and minor\r\nfacts of history connected with the house before which those signs swung\r\nin the air.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity that such a task as the following was not undertaken many\r\nyears ago; it would have been much better accomplished then than now.\r\nLondon is so rapidly changing its aspect, that ten years hence many of\r\nthe particulars here gathered could no longer be collected. Already,\r\nduring the printing of this work, three old houses famous for their\r\nsigns have been doomed to destruction--the Mitre in Fleet Street, the\r\nTabard in Southwark, (where Chaucer’s pilgrims lay,) and Don Saltero’s\r\nhouse in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. The best existing specimens of old\r\nsignboards may be seen in our cathedral towns. Antiquaries cling to\r\nthese places, and the inhabitants themselves are generally animated by a\r\nstrong conservative feeling. In London an entire street might be removed\r\nwith far less of public discussion than would attend the taking down of\r\nan old decayed sign in one of these provincial cities. Does the reader\r\nremember an article in _Punch_, about two years ago, entitled “Asses in\r\nCanterbury?” It was in ridicule of the Canterbury Commissioners of\r\nPavement, who had held grave deliberations on the well-known sign of Sir\r\nJohn Falstaff, hanging from the front of the hotel of that name,--a\r\nhouse which has been open for public entertainment these three hundred\r\nyears. The knight with sword and buckler (from “Henry the Fourth,”) was\r\nsuspended from some ornamental iron-work, far above the pavement, in the\r\nopen thoroughfare leading to the famous Westgate, and formed one of the\r\nmost noticeable objects in this part of Canterbury. In 1787, when the\r\ngeneral order was issued for the removal of all the signs in the\r\ncity--many of them obstructed the thoroughfares--this was looked upon\r\nwith so much veneration that it was allowed to remain until 1863, when\r\nfor no apparent reason it was sentenced to destruction. However, it was\r\nonly with the greatest difficulty that men could be found to pull it\r\ndown, and then several cans of beer had first to be distributed amongst\r\nthem as an incentive to action--in so great veneration was the old sign\r\nheld even by the lower orders of the place. Eight pounds were paid for\r\nthis destruction, which, for fear of a riot, was effected at three in\r\nthe morning, “amid the groans and hisses of the assembled multitude,”\r\nsays a local paper. Previous to the demolition the greatest excitement\r\nhad existed in the place; the newspapers were filled with articles; a\r\npetition with 400 signatures--including an M.P., the prebends, minor\r\ncanons, and clergy of the cathedral--prayed the local “commissioners”\r\nthat the sign might be spared; and the whole community was in an uproar.\r\nNo sooner was the old portrait of Sir John removed than another was put\r\nup; but this representing the knight as seated, and with a can of ale by\r\nhis side, however much it may suit the modern publican’s notion of\r\nmilitary ardour, does not please the owner of the property, and a\r\n_fac-simile_ of the time-honoured original is in course of preparation.\r\n\r\nConcerning the internal arrangement of the following work, a few\r\nexplanations seem necessary.\r\n\r\nWhere a street is mentioned without the town being specified, it in all\r\ncases refers to a London thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nThe trades tokens so frequently referred to, it will be scarcely\r\nnecessary to state, were the brass farthings issued by shop or tavern\r\nkeepers, and generally adorned with a representation of the sign of the\r\nhouse. Nearly all the tokens alluded to belong to the latter part of the\r\nseventeenth century, mostly to the reign of Charles II.\r\n\r\nAs the work has been two years in the press, the passing events\r\nmentioned in the earlier sheets refer to the year 1864.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances it was found impossible to ascertain whether certain\r\nsigns spoken of as existing really do exist, or whether those mentioned\r\nas things of the past are in reality so. The wide distances at which\r\nthey are situated prevented personal examination in every case, and\r\nlocal histories fail to give such small particulars.\r\n\r\nThe rude unattractive woodcuts inserted in the work are in most\r\ninstances _fac-similes_, which have been chosen as genuine examples of\r\nthe style in which the various old signs were represented. The blame of\r\nthe coarse and primitive execution, therefore, rests entirely with the\r\nancient artist, whether sign painter or engraver.\r\n\r\nTranslations of the various quotations from foreign languages have been\r\nadded for the following reasons:--It was necessary to translate the\r\nnumerous quotations from the Dutch signboards; Latin was Englished for\r\nthe benefit of the ladies, and Italian and French extracts were\r\nAnglicised to correspond with rest.\r\n\r\nErrors, both of fact and opinion, may doubtless be discovered in the\r\nbook. If, however, the compilers have erred in a statement or an\r\nexplanation, they do not wish to remain in the dark, and any light\r\nthrown upon a doubtful passage will be acknowledged by them with thanks.\r\nNumerous local signs--famous in their own neighbourhood--will have been\r\nomitted, (generally, however, for the reasons mentioned on a preceding\r\npage,) whilst many curious anecdotes and particulars concerning their\r\nhistory may be within the knowledge of provincial readers. For any\r\ninformation of this kind the compilers will be much obliged; and should\r\ntheir work ever pass to a second edition, they hope to avail themselves\r\nof such friendly contributions.\r\n\r\n  LONDON, _June 1866_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n  GENERAL SURVEY OF SIGNBOARD HISTORY,                                 1\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n  HISTORIC AND COMMEMORATIVE SIGNS,                                   45\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n  HERALDIC AND EMBLEMATIC SIGNS,                                     101\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n  SIGNS OF ANIMALS AND MONSTERS,                                     150\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.\r\n  BIRDS AND FOWLS,                                                   199\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI.\r\n  FISHES AND INSECTS,                                                225\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII.\r\n  FLOWERS, TREES, HERBS, ETC.,                                       233\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII.\r\n  BIBLICAL AND RELIGIOUS SIGNS,                                      253\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX.\r\n  SAINTS, MARTYRS, ETC.,                                             279\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER X.\r\n  DIGNITIES, TRADES, AND PROFESSIONS,                                305\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XI.\r\n  THE HOUSE AND THE TABLE,                                           375\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XII.\r\n  DRESS; PLAIN AND ORNAMENTAL,                                       399\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIII.\r\n  GEOGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY,                                          414\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XIV.\r\n  HUMOROUS AND COMIC,                                                437\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XV.\r\n  PUNS AND REBUSES,                                                  469\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XVI.\r\n  MISCELLANEOUS SIGNS,                                               476\r\n\r\n  APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n  BONNELL THORNTON’S SIGNBOARD EXHIBITION,                           512\r\n\r\n  INDEX OF ALL THE SIGNS MENTIONED IN THE WORK,                      527\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n\r\nBAKER.\r\n\r\n(Pompeii, A.D. 70.)\r\n\r\nDAIRY.\r\n\r\n(Pompeii, A.D. 70.)\r\n\r\nSHOEMAKER.\r\n\r\n(Herculaneum.)\r\n\r\nWINE MERCHANT.\r\n\r\n(Pompeii, A.D. 70.)\r\n\r\nTWO JOLLY BREWERS.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Bills, 1770.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SURVEY OF SIGNBOARD HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the cities of the East all trades are confined to certain streets, or\r\nto certain rows in the various bazars and wekalehs. Jewellers,\r\nsilk-embroiderers, pipe-dealers, traders in drugs,--each of these\r\nclasses has its own quarter, where, in little open shops, the merchants\r\nsit enthroned upon a kind of low counter, enjoying their pipes and their\r\ncoffee with the _otium cum dignitate_ characteristic of the Mussulman.\r\nThe purchaser knows the row to go to; sees at a glance what each shop\r\ncontains; and, if he be an _habitué_, will know the face of each\r\nparticular shopkeeper, so that under these circumstances, signboards\r\nwould be of no use.\r\n\r\nWith the ancient Egyptians it was much the same. As a rule, no picture\r\nor description affixed to the shop announced the trade of the owner; the\r\ngoods exposed for sale were thought sufficient to attract attention.\r\nOccasionally, however, there were inscriptions denoting the trade, with\r\nthe emblem which indicated it;[1] whence we may assume that this ancient\r\nnation was the first to appreciate the benefit that might be derived\r\nfrom signboards.\r\n\r\nWhat we know of the Greek signs is very meagre and indefinite.\r\nAristophanes, Lucian, and other writers, make frequent allusions, which\r\nseem to prove that signboards were in use with the Greeks. Thus\r\nAristotle says: ὡσπερ επι των καπηλιων γραφομενοι, μικροι μεν εισι,\r\nφαινονται δε εχοντες πλατη και βαθη.[2] And Athenæus: εν προτεροις θηκη\r\nδιδασκαλιην.[3] But what their signs were, and whether carved, painted,\r\nor the natural object, is entirely unknown.\r\n\r\nWith the Romans only we begin to have distinct data. In the Eternal\r\nCity, some streets, as in our mediæval towns, derived their names from\r\nsigns. Such, for instance, was the vicus Ursi Pileati, (the street of\r\n“The Bear with the Hat on,”) in the Esquiliæ. The nature of their signs,\r\nalso, is well known. The BUSH, their tavern-sign, gave rise to the\r\nproverb, “Vino vendibili suspensa hedera non opus est;” and hence we\r\nderive our sign of the Bush, and our proverb, “Good Wine needs no\r\nBush.” An _ansa_, or handle of a pitcher, was the sign of their\r\npost-houses, (_stathmoi_ or _allagæ_,) and hence these establishments\r\nwere afterwards denominated _ansæ_.[4] That they also had painted signs,\r\nor exterior decorations which served their purpose, is clearly evident\r\nfrom various authors:--\r\n\r\n  “Quum victi Mures Mustelarum exercitu\r\n  (Historia quorum in tabernis pingitur.)”[5]\r\n\r\n  PHÆDRUS, lib. iv. fab. vi.\r\n\r\nThese Roman street pictures were occasionally no mean works of art, as\r\nwe may learn from a passage in Horace:--\r\n\r\n                        “Contento poplite miror\r\n  Proelia, rubrico picta aut carbone; velut si\r\n  Re vera pugnent, feriant vitentque moventes\r\n  Arma viri.”[6]\r\n\r\nCicero also is supposed by some scholars to allude to a sign when he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  “Jam ostendamcujus modi sis: quum ille ‘ostende quæso’ demonstravi\r\n  digito pictum Gallum in Mariano scuto Cimbrico, sub Novis, distortum\r\n  ejectâ linguâ, buccis fluentibus, risus est commotus.”[7]\r\n\r\nPliny, after saying that Lucius Mummius was the first in Rome who\r\naffixed a picture to the outside of a house, continues:--\r\n\r\n  “Deinde video et in foro positas vulgo. Hinc enim Crassi oratoris\r\n  lepos, [here follows the anecdote of the Cock of Marius the Cimberian]\r\n  . . . In foro fuit et illa pastoris senis cum baculo, de qua\r\n  Teutonorum legatus respondit, interrogatus quanti eum æstimaret, sibi\r\n  donari nolle talem vivum verumque.”[8]\r\n\r\nFabius also, according to some, relates the story of the cock, and his\r\nexplanation is cited:--“Taberna autem erant circa Forum, ac scutum illud\r\nsigni gratia positum.”[9]\r\n\r\nBut we can judge even better from an inspection of the Roman signs\r\nthemselves, as they have come down to us amongst the ruins of\r\nHerculaneum and Pompeii. A few were painted; but, as a rule, they appear\r\nto have been made of stone, or terra-cotta relievo, and let into the\r\npilasters at the side of the open shop-fronts. Thus there have been\r\nfound a _goat_, the sign of a dairy; a _mule_ driving a mill, the sign\r\nof a baker, (plate 1.) At the door of a schoolmaster was the not very\r\ntempting sign of a boy receiving a good birching. Very similar to our\r\nTwo Jolly Brewers, carrying a tun slung on a long pole, a Pompeian\r\npublic-house keeper had two slaves represented above his door, carrying\r\nan amphora; and another wine-merchant had a painting of Bacchus pressing\r\na bunch of grapes. At a perfumer’s shop, in the street of Mercury, were\r\nrepresented various items of that profession--viz., four men carrying a\r\nbox with vases of perfume, men occupied in laying out and perfuming a\r\ncorpse, &c. There was also a sign similar to the one mentioned by\r\nHorace, the Two Gladiators, under which, in the usual Pompeian\r\ncacography, was the following imprecation:--ABIAT VENEREM POMPEIIANAMA\r\nIRADAM QUI HOC LÆSERIT, _i.e._, _Habeat Venerem Pompeianam iratam_, &c.\r\nBesides these there were the signs of the Anchor, the Ship, (perhaps a\r\nship-chandler’s,) a sort of a Cross, the Chequers, the Phallus on a\r\nbaker’s shop, with the words, HIC HABITAT FELICITAS; whilst in\r\nHerculaneum there was a very cleverly painted Amorino, or Cupid,\r\ncarrying a pair of ladies’ shoes, one on his head and the other in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIt is also probable that, at a later period at all events, the various\r\nartificers of Rome had their tools as the sign of their house, to\r\nindicate their profession. We find that they sculptured them on their\r\ntombs in the catacombs, and may safely conclude that they would do the\r\nsame on their houses in the land of the living. Thus on the tomb of\r\nDiogenes, the grave-digger, there is a pick-axe and a lamp; Bauto and\r\nMaxima have the tools of carpenters, a saw, an adze, and a chisel;\r\nVeneria, a tire-woman, has a mirror and a comb:--then there are others\r\nwho have wool-combers’ implements; a physician, who has a cupping-glass;\r\na poulterer, a case of poultry; a surveyor, a measuring rule; a baker, a\r\nbushel, a millstone, and ears of corn; in fact, almost every trade had\r\nits symbolic implements. Even that cockney custom of punning on the\r\nname, so common on signboards, finds its precedent in those mansions of\r\nthe dead. Owing to this fancy, the grave of Dracontius bore a dragon;\r\nOnager, a wild ass; Umbricius, a shady tree; Leo, a lion; Doleus,\r\nfather and son, two casks; Herbacia, two baskets of herbs; and Porcula,\r\na pig. Now it seems most probable that, since these emblems were used to\r\nindicate where a baker, a carpenter, or a tire-woman was buried, they\r\nwould adopt similar symbols above ground, to acquaint the public where a\r\nbaker, a carpenter, or a tire-woman lived.\r\n\r\nWe may thus conclude that our forefathers adopted the signboard from the\r\nRomans; and though at first there were certainly not so many shops as to\r\nrequire a picture for distinction,--as the open shop-front did not\r\nnecessitate any emblem to indicate the trade carried on within,--yet the\r\ninns by the road-side, and in the towns, would undoubtedly have them.\r\nThere was the Roman bush of evergreens to indicate the sale of wine;[10]\r\nand certain devices would doubtless be adopted to attract the attention\r\nof the different classes of wayfarers, as the Cross for the Christian\r\ncustomer,[11] and the Sun or the Moon for the pagan. Then we find\r\nvarious emblems, or standards, to court respectively the custom of the\r\nSaxon, the Dane, or the Briton. He that desired the patronage of\r\nsoldiers might put up some weapon; or, if he sought his customers among\r\nthe more quiet artificers, there were the various implements of trade\r\nwith which he could appeal to the different mechanics that frequented\r\nhis neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAlong with these very simple signs, at a later period, coats of arms,\r\ncrests, and badges, would gradually make their appearance at the doors\r\nof shops and inns. The reasons which dictated the choice of such\r\nsubjects were various. One of the principal was this. In the Middle\r\nAges, the houses of the nobility, both in town and country, when the\r\nfamily was absent, were used as hostelries for travellers. The family\r\narms always hung in front of the house, and the most conspicuous object\r\nin those arms gave a name to the establishment amongst travellers, who,\r\nunacquainted with the mysteries of heraldry, called a lion gules or\r\nazure by the vernacular name of the _Red_ or _Blue Lion_.[12] Such coats\r\nof arms gradually became a very popular intimation that there was--\r\n\r\n  “Good entertainment for all that passes,--\r\n  Horses, mares, men, and asses;”\r\n\r\nand innkeepers began to adopt them, hanging out red lions and green\r\ndragons as the best way to acquaint the public that they offered food\r\nand shelter.\r\n\r\nStill, as long as civilisation was only at a low ebb, the so-called\r\nopen-houses few, and competition trifling, signs were of but little use.\r\nA few objects, typical of the trade carried on, would suffice; a knife\r\nfor the cutler, a stocking for the hosier, a hand for the glover, a pair\r\nof scissors for the tailor, a bunch of grapes for the vintner, fully\r\nanswered public requirements. But as luxury increased, and the number of\r\nhouses or shops dealing in the same article multiplied, something more\r\nwas wanted. Particular trades continued to be confined to particular\r\nstreets; the desideratum then was, to give to each shop a name or token\r\nby which it might be mentioned in conversation, so that it could be\r\nrecommended and customers sent to it. Reading was still a scarce\r\nacquirement; consequently, to write up the owner’s name would have been\r\nof little use. Those that could, advertised their name by a rebus; thus,\r\na hare and a bottle stood for Harebottle, and two cocks for Cox. Others,\r\nwhose names no rebus could represent, adopted pictorial objects; and, as\r\nthe quantity of these augmented, new subjects were continually required.\r\nThe animal kingdom was ransacked, from the mighty elephant to the humble\r\nbee, from the eagle to the sparrow; the vegetable kingdom, from the\r\npalm-tree and cedar to the marigold and daisy; everything on the earth,\r\nand in the firmament above it, was put under contribution. Portraits of\r\nthe great men of all ages, and views of towns, both painted with a great\r\ndeal more of fancy than of truth; articles of dress, implements of\r\ntrades, domestic utensils, things visible and invisible, _ea quæ sunt\r\ntamquam ea quæ non sunt_, everything was attempted in order to attract\r\nattention and to obtain publicity. Finally, as all signs in a town were\r\npainted by the same small number of individuals, whose talents and\r\nimagination were limited, it followed that the same subjects were\r\nnaturally often repeated, introducing only a change in the colour for a\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nSince all the pictorial representations were, then, of much the same\r\nquality, rival tradesmen tried to outvie each other in the size of their\r\nsigns, each one striving to obtrude his picture into public notice by\r\nputting it out further in the street than his neighbour’s. The “Liber\r\nAlbus,” compiled in 1419, names this subject amongst the Inquisitions at\r\nthe Wardmotes: “Item, if the ale-stake of any tavern is longer or\r\nextends further than ordinary.” And in book iii. part iii. p. 389, is\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n  “Also, it was ordained that, whereas the ale-stakes projecting in\r\n  front of taverns in Chepe, and elsewhere in the said city, extend too\r\n  far over the King’s highways, to the impeding of riders and others,\r\n  and, by reason of their excessive weight, to the great deterioration\r\n  of the houses in which they are fixed;--to the end that opportune\r\n  remedy might be made thereof, it was by the Mayor and Aldermen granted\r\n  and ordained, and, upon summons of all the taverners of the said city,\r\n  it was enjoined upon them, under pain of paying forty pence[13] unto\r\n  the Chamber of the Guildhall, on every occasion upon which they should\r\n  transgress such ordinance, that no one of them in future should have a\r\n  stake, bearing either his sign, or leaves, extending or lying over the\r\n  King’s highway, of greater length than seven feet at most, and that\r\n  this ordinance should begin to take effect at the Feast of Saint\r\n  Michael, then next ensuing, always thereafter to be valid and of full\r\n  effect.”\r\n\r\nThe booksellers generally had a woodcut of their signs for the colophon\r\nof their books, so that their shops might get known by the inspection of\r\nthese cuts. For this reason, Benedict Hector, one of the early Bolognese\r\nprinters, gives this advice to the buyers in his “Justinus et Florus:”--\r\n\r\n  “Emptor, attende quando vis emere libros formatos in officina mea\r\n  excussoria, inspice signum quod in liminari pagina est, ita numquam\r\n  falleris. Nam quidam malevoli Impressores libris suis inemendatis et\r\n  maculosis apponunt nomen meum ut fiant vendibiliores.”[14]\r\n\r\nJodocus Badius of Paris, gives a similar caution:--\r\n\r\n  “Oratum facimus lectorem ut signum inspiciat, nam sunt qui titulum\r\n  nomenque Badianum mentiantur et laborem suffurentur.”[15]\r\n\r\nAldus, the great Venetian printer, exposes a similar fraud, and points\r\nout how the pirate had copied the sign also in his colophon; but, by\r\ninadvertency, making a slight alteration:--\r\n\r\n  “Extremum est ut admoneamus studiosissimum quemque, Florentinos\r\n  quosdam impressores, cum viderint se diligentiam nostram in castigando\r\n  et imprimendo non posse assequi, ad artes confugisse solitas; hoc est\r\n  Grammaticis Institutionibus Aldi in sua officina formatis, notam\r\n  Delphini Anchoræ Involuti nostram apposuisse; sed ita egerunt ut\r\n  quivis mediocriter versatus in libris impressionis nostræ animadvertit\r\n  illos impudenter fecisse. Nam rostrum Delphini in partem sinistram\r\n  vergit, cum tamen nostrum in dexteram totum demittatur.”[16]\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that a sign was considered an heirloom, and descended\r\nfrom father to son, like the coat of arms of the nobility, which was the\r\ncase with the Brazen Serpent, the sign of Reynold Wolfe. “His trade was\r\ncontinued a good while after his demise by his wife Joan, who made her\r\nwill the 1st of July 1574, whereby she desires to be buried near her\r\nhusband, in St Faith’s Church, and bequeathed to her son, Robert Wolfe,\r\nthe chapel-house, [their printing-office,] the Brazen Serpent, and all\r\nthe prints, letters, furniture,” etc.--DIBDIN’S _Typ. Ant._, vol. iv. p.\r\n6.\r\n\r\nAs we observed above, directly signboards were generally adopted,\r\nquaintness became one of the desiderata, and costliness another. This\r\nlast could be obtained by the quality of the picture, but, for two\r\nreasons, was not much aimed at--firstly, because good artists were\r\nscarce in those days; and even had they obtained a good picture, the\r\nignorant crowd that daily passed underneath the sign would, in all\r\nprobability, have thought the harsh and glaring daub a finer production\r\nof art than a Holy Virgin by Rafaelle himself. The other reason was the\r\ninstability of such a work, exposed to sun, wind, rain, frost, and the\r\nnightly attacks of revellers and roisters. Greater care, therefore, was\r\nbestowed upon the ornamentation of the ironwork by which it was\r\nsuspended; and this was perfectly in keeping with the taste of the\r\ntimes, when even the simplest lock or hinges could not be launched into\r\nthe world without its scrolls and strapwork.\r\n\r\nThe signs then were suspended from an iron bar, fixed either in the wall\r\nof the house, or in a post or obelisk standing in front of it; in both\r\ncases the ironwork was shaped and ornamented with that taste so\r\nconspicuous in the metal-work of the Renaissance period, of which many\r\nchurches, and other buildings of that period, still bear witness. In\r\nprovincial towns and villages, where there was sufficient room in the\r\nstreets, the sign was generally suspended from a kind of small triumphal\r\narch, standing out in the road, partly wood, partly iron, and ornamented\r\nwith all that carving, gilding, and colouring could bestow upon it,\r\n(_see_ description of White-Hart Inn at Scole.) Some of the designs of\r\nthis class of ironwork have come down to us in the works of the old\r\nmasters, and are indeed exquisite.\r\n\r\nPainted signs then, suspended in the way we have just pointed out, were\r\nmore common than those of any other kind; yet not a few shops simply\r\nsuspended at their doors some prominent article in their trade, which\r\ncustom has outlived the more elegant signboards, and may be daily\r\nwitnessed in our streets, where the ironmonger’s frying-pan, or\r\ndust-pan, the hardware-dealer’s teapot, the grocer’s tea-canister, the\r\nshoemaker’s last or clog, with the Golden Boot, and many similar\r\nobjects, bear witness to this old custom.\r\n\r\nLastly, there was in London another class of houses that had a peculiar\r\nway of placing their signs--viz., the Stews upon the Bankside, which\r\nwere, by a proclamation of 37 Hen. VIII., “whited and painted with signs\r\non the front, for a token of the said houses.” Stow enumerates some of\r\nthese symbols, such as the Cross-Keys, the Gun, the Castle, the Crane,\r\nthe Cardinal’s Hat, the Bell, the Swan, &c.\r\n\r\nStill greater variety in the construction of the signs existed in\r\nFrance; for besides the painted signs in the iron frames, the\r\nshopkeepers in Paris, according to H. Sauval, (“Antiquités de la Ville\r\nde Paris,”) had anciently banners hanging above their doors, or from\r\ntheir windows, with the sign of the shop painted on them; whilst in the\r\nsixteenth century carved wooden signs were very common. These, however,\r\nwere not suspended, but formed part of the wooden construction of the\r\nhouse; some of them were really _chefs-d’œuvres_, and as careful in\r\ndesign as a carved cathedral stall. Several of them are still remaining\r\nin Rouen and other old towns; many also have been removed and placed in\r\nvarious local museums of antiquities. The most general rule, however, on\r\nthe Continent, as in England, was to have the painted signboard\r\nsuspended across the streets.\r\n\r\nAn observer of James I.’s time has jotted down the names of all the\r\ninns, taverns, and side streets in the line of road between Charing\r\nCross and the old Tower of London, which document lies now embalmed\r\namongst the Harl. MS., 6850, fol. 31. In imagination we can walk with\r\nhim through the metropolis:--\r\n\r\n  “On the way from Whitehall to Charing Cross we pass: the White Hart,\r\n  the Red Lion, the Mairmade, iij. Tuns, Salutation, the Graihound, the\r\n  Bell, the Golden Lyon. In sight of Charing Crosse: the Garter, the\r\n  Crown, the Bear and Ragged Staffe, the Angel, the King Harry Head.\r\n  Then from Charing Cross towards ye cittie: another White Hart, the\r\n  Eagle and Child, the Helmet, the Swan, the Bell, King Harry Head, the\r\n  Flower-de-luce, Angel, the Holy Lambe, the Bear and Harroe, the\r\n  Plough, the Shippe, the Black Bell, another King Harry Head, the Bull\r\n  Head, the Golden Bull, ‘a sixpenny ordinarye,’ another Flower-de-luce,\r\n  the Red Lyon, the Horns, the White Hors, the Prince’s Arms, Bell\r\n  Savadge’s In, the S. John the Baptist, the Talbot, the Shipp of War,\r\n  the S. Dunstan, the Hercules or the Owld Man Tavern, the Mitar,\r\n  another iij. Tunnes Inn, and a iij. Tunnes Tavern, and a Graihound,\r\n  another Mitar, another King Harry Head, iij. Tunnes, and the iij.\r\n  Cranes.”\r\n\r\nHaving walked from Whitechapel “straight forward to the Tower,” the good\r\ncitizen got tired, and so we hear no more of him.\r\n\r\nIn the next reign we find the following enumerated by Taylor the\r\nwater-poet, in one of his facetious pamphlets:--5 Angels, 4 Anchors, 6\r\nBells, 5 Bullsheads, 4 Black Bulls, 4 Bears, 5 Bears and Dolphins, 10\r\nCastles, 4 Crosses, (red or white,) 7 Three Crowns, 7 Green Dragons, 6\r\nDogs, 5 Fountains, 3 Fleeces, 8 Globes, 5 Greyhounds, 9 White Harts, 4\r\nWhite Horses, 5 Harrows, 20 King’s Heads, 7 King’s Arms, 1 Queen’s Head,\r\n8 Golden Lyons, 6 Red Lyons, 7 Halfmoons, 10 Mitres, 33 Maidenheads, 10\r\nMermaids, 2 Mouths, 8 Nagsheads, 8 Prince’s Arms, 4 Pope’s Heads, 13\r\nSuns, 8 Stars, &c. Besides these he mentions an Adam and Eve, an Antwerp\r\nTavern, a Cat, a Christopher, a Cooper’s Hoop, a Goat, a Garter, a\r\nHart’s Horn, a Mitre, &c. These were all taverns in London; and it will\r\nbe observed that their signs were very similar to those seen at the\r\npresent day--a remark applicable to the taverns not only of England, but\r\nof Europe generally, at this period. In another work Taylor gives us the\r\nsigns of the taverns[17] and alehouses in ten shires and counties about\r\nLondon, all similar to those we have just enumerated; but amongst the\r\nnumber, it may be noted, there is not one combination of two objects,\r\nexcept the Eagle and Child, and the Bear and Ragged Staff. In a\r\nblack-letter tract entitled “Newes from Bartholomew Fayre,” the\r\nfollowing are named:--\r\n\r\n  “There has been great sale and utterance of Wine,\r\n  Besides Beer, Ale, and Hippocrass fine,\r\n  In every Country, Region, and Nation,\r\n  Chiefly at Billingsgate, at the Salutation;\r\n  And Boreshead near London Stone,\r\n  The Swan at Dowgate, a tavern well knowne;\r\n  The Mitre in Cheap, and the Bullhead,\r\n  And many like places that make noses red;\r\n  The Boreshead in Old Fish Street, Three Cranes in the Vintree,\r\n  And now, of late, Saint Martin’s in the Sentree;\r\n  The Windmill in Lothbury, the Ship at the Exchange,\r\n  King’s Head in New Fish Street, where Roysters do range;\r\n  The Mermaid in Cornhill, Red Lion in the Strand,\r\n  Three Tuns in Newgate Market, in Old Fish Street the Swan.”\r\n\r\nDrunken Barnaby, (1634,) in his travels, called at several of the London\r\ntaverns, which he has recorded in his vinous flights:--\r\n\r\n  “Country left I in a fury,\r\n  To the Axe in Aldermanbury\r\n  First arrived, that place slighted,\r\n  I at the Rose in Holborn lighted.\r\n  From the Rose in Flaggons sail I\r\n  To the Griffin i’ th’ Old Bailey,\r\n  Where no sooner do I waken,\r\n  Than to Three Cranes I am taken,\r\n  Where I lodge and am no starter.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Yea, my merry mates and I, too,\r\n  Oft the Cardinal’s Hat do fly to.\r\n  There at Hart’s Horns we carouse,” &c.\r\n\r\nAlready, in very early times, publicans were compelled by law to have a\r\nsign; for we find that in the 16 Richard II., (1393,) Florence North, a\r\nbrewer of Chelsea, was “presented” “for not putting up the usual\r\nsign.”[18] In Cambridge the regulations were equally severe; by an Act\r\nof Parliament, 9 Henry VI., it was enacted: “Quicunq; de villa\r\nCantebrigg ‘braciaverit ad vendend’ exponat signum suum, alioquin\r\nomittat cervisiam.”--_Rolls of Parliament_, vol. v. fol. 426 a.[19] But\r\nwith the other trades it was always optional. Hence Charles I., on his\r\naccession to the throne, gave the inhabitants of London a charter by\r\nwhich, amongst other favours, he granted them the right to hang out\r\nsignboards:--\r\n\r\n  “And further, we do give and grant to the said Mayor, and Commonalty,\r\n  and Citizens of the said city, and their successors, that it may and\r\n  shall be lawful to the Citizens of the same city and any of them, for\r\n  the time being, to expose and hang in and over the streets, and ways,\r\n  and alleys of the said city and suburbs of the same, signs, and posts\r\n  of signs, affixed to their houses and shops, for the better finding\r\n  out such citizens’ dwellings, shops, arts, or occupations, without\r\n  impediment, molestation, or interruption of his heirs or successors.”\r\n\r\nIn France, the innkeepers were under the same regulations as in England;\r\nfor there also, by the edict of Moulins, in 1567, all innkeepers were\r\nordered to acquaint the magistrates with their name and address, and\r\ntheir “affectes et enseignes;” and Henri III., by an edict of March\r\n1577, ordered that all innkeepers should place a sign on the most\r\nconspicuous part of their houses, “aux lieux les plus apparents;” so\r\nthat everybody, even those that could not read, should be aware of their\r\nprofession. Louis XIV., by an ordnance of 1693, again ordered signs to\r\nbe put up, and also the price of the articles they were entitled to\r\nsell:--\r\n\r\n  “Art. XXIII.--Taverniers metront enseignes et bouchons. . . . Nul ne\r\n  pourra tenir taverne en cette dite ville et faubourgs, sans mettre\r\n  enseigne et bouchon.”[20]\r\n\r\nHence, the taking away of a publican’s licence was accompanied by the\r\ntaking away of his sign:--\r\n\r\n  “For this gross fault I here do damn thy licence,\r\n  Forbidding thee ever to tap or draw;\r\n  For instantly I will in mine own person,\r\n  Command the constables to pull down thy sign.”\r\n\r\n  MASSINGER, _A New Way to Pay Old Debts_, iv. 2.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the great Civil War, house-signs played no inconsiderable\r\npart in the changes and convulsions of the state, and took a prominent\r\nplace in the politics of the day. We may cite an earlier example, where\r\na sign was made a matter of high treason--namely, in the case of that\r\nunfortunate fellow in Cheapside, who, in the reign of Edward IV., kept\r\nthe sign of the Crown, and lost his head for saying he would “make his\r\nson heir to the Crown.” But more general examples are to be met with in\r\nthe history of the Commonwealth troubles. At the death of Charles I.,\r\nJohn Taylor the water-poet, a Royalist to the backbone, boldly shewed\r\nhis opinion of that act, by taking as a sign for his alehouse in Phœnix\r\nAlley, Long Acre, the Mourning Crown; but he was soon compelled to take\r\nit down. Richard Flecknoe, in his “Ænigmatical Characters,” (1665,)\r\ntells us how many of the severe Puritans were shocked at anything\r\nsmelling of Popery:--“As for the signs, they have pretty well begun\r\ntheir reformation already, changing the sign of the Salutation of Our\r\nLady into the Souldier and Citizen, and the Catherine Wheel into the\r\nCat and Wheel; such ridiculous work they make of this reformation, and\r\nso jealous they are against all mirth and jollity, as they would pluck\r\ndown the Cat and Fiddle too, if it durst but play so loud as they might\r\nhear it.” No doubt they invented very godly signs, but these have not\r\ncome down to us.\r\n\r\nAt that time, also, a fashion prevailed which continued, indeed, as long\r\nas the signboard was an important institution--of using house-signs to\r\ntypify political ideas. Imaginary signs, as a part of secret imprints,\r\nconveying most unmistakably the sentiments of the book, were often used\r\nin the old days of political plots and violent lampoons. Instance the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n  “VOX BOREALIS, or a Northerne Discoverie, by Way of Dialogue, between\r\n  Jamie and Willie. Amidst the Babylonians--printed by Margery\r\n  Marprelate, in Thwack Coat Lane, at the sign of the _Crab-Tree\r\n  Cudgell_, without any privilege of the Catercaps. 1641.”\r\n\r\n  “ARTICLES OF HIGH TREASON made and enacted by the late Halfquarter\r\n  usurping Convention, and now presented to the publick view for a\r\n  general satisfaction of all true Englishmen. Imprinted for Erasmus\r\n  Thorogood, and to be sold at the signe of the _Roasted Rump_. 1659.”\r\n\r\n  “A CATALOGUE OF BOOKS of the Newest Fashion, to be sold by auction at\r\n  the Whigs’ Coffeehouse, at the sign of the _Jackanapes_ in Prating\r\n  Alley, near the Deanery of Saint Paul’s.”\r\n\r\n  “THE CENSURE OF THE ROTA upon Mr Milton’s book, entitled ‘The Ready\r\n  and Easy Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth,’ &c. Printed at London\r\n  by Paul Giddy, Printer to the Rota, at the sign of the _Windmill_, in\r\n  Turn-again Lane. 1660.”\r\n\r\n  “AN ADDRESS from the Ladies of the Provinces of Munster and Leinster\r\n  to their Graces the Duke and Duchess of D----t, Lord G----, and\r\n  Caiaphas the High Priest, with sixty original toasts, drank by the\r\n  Ladies at their last Assembly, with Love-letters added. London:\r\n  Printed for John Pro Patria, at the sign of _Vivat Rex_. 1754.”\r\n\r\n  “CHIVALRY no Trifle, or the Knight and his Lady: a Tale. To which is\r\n  added the Hue and Cry after Touzer and Spitfire, the Lady’s two\r\n  lapdogs. Dublin: Printed at the sign of _Sir Tady’s Press_, etc.\r\n  1754.”\r\n\r\n  “AN ADDRESS from the Influential Electors of the County and City of\r\n  Galway, with a Collection of 60 Original Patriot Toasts and 48 Munster\r\n  Toasts, with Intelligence from the Kingdom of Eutopia. Printed at the\r\n  sign of the _Pirate’s Sword in the Captain’s Scabbard_. London, 1754.”\r\n\r\n  “THE C----T’S APOLOGY to the Freeholders of this Kingdom for their\r\n  conduct, containing some Pieces of Humour, to which is added a Bill of\r\n  C----t Morality. London: Printed at the sign of _Betty Ireland, d----d\r\n  of a Tyrant in Purple, a Monster in Black_, etc.”\r\n\r\nIn the newspapers of the eighteenth century, we find that signs were\r\nconstantly used as emblems of, or as sharp hits at, the politics of the\r\nday; thus, in the _Weekly Journal_ for August 17, 1718, allusions are\r\nmade to the sign of the Salutation, in Newgate Street, by the opposition\r\nparty, to which the _Original Weekly Journal_, the week after,\r\nretaliates by a description and explanation of an indelicate sign said\r\nto be in King Street, Westminster. In 1763, the following pasquinade\r\nwent the round of the newspapers, said to have been sent over from\r\nHolland:--\r\n\r\n  “HÔTELS POUR LES MINISTRES DES COURS ETRANGÈRES AU FUTUR CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n  De l’Empereur,\r\n  À la Bonne Volonté; rue d’Impuissance.\r\n  De Russie,\r\n  Au Chimère; rue des Caprices.\r\n  De France,\r\n  Au Coq déplumé; rue de Canada.\r\n  D’Autriche,\r\n  À la Mauvaise Alliance, rue des Invalides.\r\n  D’Angleterre,\r\n  À la Fortune, Place des Victoires, rue des Subsides.\r\n  De Prusse,\r\n  Aux Quatre vents, rue des Renards, près la Place des Guinées.\r\n  De Suede,\r\n  Au Passage des Courtisans, rue des Visionaires.\r\n  De Pologne,\r\n  Au Sacrifice d’Abraham, rue des Innocents, près la Place des Devôts.\r\n  Des Princes de l’Empire,\r\n  Au Roitelêt, près de l’Hôpital des Incurables, rue des Charlatans.\r\n  De Wirtemberg,\r\n  Au Don Quichotte, rue des Fantômes près de la Montagne en Couche.\r\n  D’Hollande,\r\n  À la Baleine, sur le Marché aux Fromages, près du Grand Observatoire.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning of September 28, 1736, all the tavern-signs in London\r\nwere in deep mourning; and no wonder, their dearly beloved patron and\r\nfriend Gin was defunct,--killed by the new Act against spirituous\r\nliquors! But they soon dropped their mourning, for Gin had only been in\r\na lethargic fit, and woke up much refreshed by his sleep. Fifteen years\r\nafter, when Hogarth painted his “Gin Lane,” royal gin was to be had\r\ncheap enough, if we may believe the signboard in that picture, which\r\ninforms us that “gentlemen and others” could get “drunk for a penny,”\r\nand “dead drunk for twopence,” in which last emergency, “clean straw for\r\nnothing” was provided.\r\n\r\nOf the signs which were to be seen in London at the period of the\r\nRestoration,--to return to the subject we were originally\r\nconsidering,--we find a goodly collection of them in one of the\r\n“Roxburghe Ballads,” (vol. i. 212,) entitled:--\r\n\r\n  “LONDON’S ORDINARIE, OR EVERY MAN IN HIS HUMOUR\r\n\r\n  THROUGH the Royal Exchange as I walked,\r\n    Where Gallants in sattin doe shine,\r\n  At midst of the day, they parted away,\r\n    To seaverall places to dine.\r\n\r\n  The Gentrie went to the _King’s Head_,\r\n    The Nobles unto the _Crowne_:\r\n  The Knights went to the _Golden Fleece_,\r\n    And the Ploughmen to the _Clowne_.\r\n\r\n  The Cleargie will dine at the _Miter_,\r\n    The Vintners at the _Three Tunnes_,\r\n  The Usurers to the _Devill_ will goe,\r\n    And the Fryers to the _Nunnes_.\r\n\r\n  The Ladyes will dine at the _Feathers_,\r\n    The _Globe_ no Captaine will scorne,\r\n  The Huntsmen will goe to the _Grayhound_ below,\r\n    And some Townes-men to the _Horne_.\r\n\r\n  The Plummers will dine at the _Fountaine_,\r\n    The Cookes at the _Holly Lambe_,\r\n  The Drunkerds by noone, to the _Man in the Moone_,\r\n    And the Cuckholdes to the _Ramme_.\r\n\r\n  The Roarers will dine at the _Lyon_,\r\n    The Watermen at the _Old Swan_;\r\n  And Bawdes will to the _Negro_ goe,\r\n    And Whores to the _Naked Man_.\r\n\r\n  The Keepers will to the _White Hart_,\r\n    The Marchants unto the _Shippe_,\r\n  The Beggars they must take their way\r\n    To the _Egge-shell_ and the _Whippe_.\r\n\r\n  The Farryers will to the _Horse_,\r\n    The Blackesmith unto the _Locke_,\r\n  The Butchers unto the _Bull_ will goe,\r\n    And the Carmen to Bridewell _Clocke_.\r\n\r\n  The Fishmongers unto the _Dolphin_,\r\n    The Barbers to the _Cheat Loafe_,[21]\r\n  The Turners unto the _Ladle_ will goe,\r\n    Where they may merrylie quaffe.\r\n\r\n  The Taylors will dine at the _Sheeres_,\r\n    The Shooemakers will to the _Boote_,\r\n  The Welshmen they will take their way,\r\n    And dine at the signe of the _Gote_.\r\n\r\n  The Hosiers will dine at the _Legge_,\r\n    The Drapers at the signe of the _Brush_.\r\n  The Fletchers to _Robin Hood_ will goe,\r\n    And the Spendthrift to _Begger’s Bush_.\r\n\r\n  The Pewterers to the _Quarte Pot_,\r\n    The Coopers will dine at the _Hoope_,\r\n  The Coblers to the _Last_ will goe,\r\n    And the Bargemen to the _Sloope_.\r\n\r\n  The Carpenters will to the _Axe_,\r\n    The Colliers will dine at the _Sacke_,\r\n  Your Fruterer he to the _Cherry-Tree_,\r\n    Good fellowes no liquor will lacke.\r\n\r\n  The Goldsmith will to the _Three Cups_,\r\n    For money they hold it as drosse;\r\n  Your Puritan to the _Pewter Canne_,\r\n    And your Papists to the _Crosse_.\r\n\r\n  The Weavers will dine at the _Shuttle_,\r\n    The Glovers will unto the _Glove_,\r\n  The Maydens all to the _Mayden Head_,\r\n    And true Louers unto the _Doue_.\r\n\r\n  The Sadlers will dine at the _Saddle_,\r\n    The Painters will to the _Greene Dragon_,\r\n  The Dutchmen will go to the _Froe_,[22]\r\n    Where each man will drinke his Flagon.\r\n\r\n  The Chandlers will dine at the _Skales_,\r\n    The Salters at the signe of the _Bagge_;\r\n  The Porters take pain at the _Labour in Vaine_,\r\n    And the Horse-Courser to the _White Nagge_.\r\n\r\n  Thus every Man in his humour,\r\n    That comes from the North or the South,\r\n  But he that has no money in his purse,\r\n    May dine at the signe of the _Mouth_.\r\n\r\n  The Swaggerers will dine at the _Fencers_,\r\n    But those that have lost their wits:\r\n  With _Bedlam Tom_ let that be their home,\r\n    And the _Drumme_ the Drummers best fits.\r\n\r\n  The Cheter will dine at the _Checker_,\r\n    The Picke-pockets in a blind alehouse,\r\n  Tel on and tride then up Holborne they ride,\r\n    And they there end at the Gallowes.”\r\n\r\nThomas Heywood introduced a similar song in his “Rape of Lucrece.” This,\r\nthe first of the kind we have met with, is in all probability the\r\noriginal, unless the ballad be a reprint from an older one; but the term\r\nPuritan used in it, seems to fix its date to the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n  “THE Gintry to the _Kings Head_,\r\n    The Nobles to the _Crown_,\r\n  The Knights unto the _Golden Fleece_,\r\n    And to the _Plough_ the Clowne.\r\n\r\n  The Churchmen to the _Mitre_,\r\n    The Shepheard to the _Star_,\r\n  The Gardener hies him to the _Rose_,\r\n    To the _Drum_ the Man of War.\r\n\r\n  The Huntsmen to the _White Hart_,\r\n    To the _Ship_ the Merchants goe,\r\n  But you that doe the Muses love,\r\n    The sign called _River Po_.\r\n\r\n  The Banquerout to the _World’s End_,\r\n    The Fool to the _Fortune_ his,\r\n  Unto the _Mouth_ the Oyster-wife,\r\n    The Fiddler to the _Pie_.\r\n\r\n  The Punk unto the _Cockatrice_,[23]\r\n    The Drunkard to the _Vine_,\r\n  The Begger to the _Bush_, there meet,\r\n    And with Duke Humphrey dine.”[24]\r\n\r\nAfter the great fire of 1666, many of the houses that were rebuilt,\r\ninstead of the former wooden signboards projecting in the streets,\r\nadopted signs carved in stone, and generally painted or gilt, let into\r\nthe front of the house, beneath the first floor windows. Many of these\r\nsigns are still to be seen, and will be noticed in their respective\r\nplaces. But in those streets not visited by the fire, things continued\r\non the old footing, each shopkeeper being fired with a noble ambition to\r\nproject his sign a few inches farther than his neighbour. The\r\nconsequence was that, what with the narrow streets, the penthouses, and\r\nthe signboards, the air and light of the heavens were well-nigh\r\nintercepted from the luckless wayfarers through the streets of London.\r\nWe can picture to ourselves the unfortunate plumed, feathered, silken\r\ngallant of the period walking, in his low shoes and silk stockings,\r\nthrough the ill-paved dirty streets, on a stormy November day, when the\r\nhonours were equally divided between fog, sleet, snow, and rain, (and no\r\numbrellas, be it remembered,) with flower-pots blown from the\r\npenthouses, spouts sending down shower-baths from almost every house,\r\nand the streaming signs swinging overhead on their rusty, creaking\r\nhinges. Certainly the evil was great, and demanded that redress which\r\nCharles II. gave in the seventh year of his reign, when a new Act\r\n“ordered that in all the streets no signboard shall hang across, but\r\nthat the sign shall be fixed against the balconies, or some convenient\r\npart of the side of the house.”\r\n\r\nThe Parisians, also, were suffering from the same enormities; everything\r\nwas of Brobdignagian proportions. “J’ai vu,” says an essayist of the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century, “suspendu aux boutiques des volants\r\nde six pieds de hauteur, des perles grosses comme des tonneaux, des\r\nplumes qui allaient au troisième étage.”[25] There, also, the scalpel of\r\nthe law was at last applied to the evil; for, in 1669, a royal order was\r\nissued to prohibit these monstrous signs, and the practice of advancing\r\nthem too far into the streets, “which made the thoroughfares close in\r\nthe daytime, and prevented the lights of the lamps from spreading\r\nproperly at night.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.\r\n\r\nBUSH.\r\n\r\n(MS. of the 14th century.)\r\n\r\nBUSH.\r\n\r\n(Bayeux tapestry, 11th cent.)\r\n\r\nCROSS.\r\n\r\n(Luttrell Psalter, 11th century.)\r\n\r\nALE-POLE.\r\n\r\n(Picture of Wouwverman, 17th cent.)\r\n\r\nBLACK JACK AND PEWTER PLATTER.\r\n\r\n(Print by Schavelin, 1480.)\r\n\r\nNAG’S HEAD.\r\n\r\n(Cheapside. 1640.)\r\n\r\nBUSH.\r\n\r\n(MS. of the 15th cent.)]\r\n\r\nStill, with all their faults, the signs had some advantages for the\r\nwayfarer; even their dissonant creaking, according to the old weather\r\nproverb, was not without its use:--\r\n\r\n  “But when the swinging signs your ears offend\r\n  With creaking noise, then rainy floods impend.”\r\n\r\n  GAY’S _Trivia_, canto i.\r\n\r\nThis indeed, from the various allusions made to it in the literature of\r\nthe last century, was regarded as a very general hint to the lounger,\r\neither to hurry home, or hail a sedan-chair or coach. Gay, in his\r\ndidactic--_flâneur_--poem, points out another benefit to be derived from\r\nthe signboards:--\r\n\r\n  “If drawn by Bus’ness to a street unknown,\r\n  Let the sworn Porter point thee through the town;\r\n  Be sure observe the Signs, for Signs remain\r\n  Like faithful Landmarks to the walking Train.”\r\n\r\nBesides, they offered constant matter of thought, speculation, and\r\namusement to the curious observer. Even Dean Swift, and the Lord High\r\nTreasurer Harley,\r\n\r\n  “Would try to read the lines\r\n  Writ underneath the country signs.”\r\n\r\nAnd certainly these productions of the country muse are often highly\r\namusing. Unfortunately for the compilers of the present work, they have\r\nnever been collected and preserved; although they would form a not\r\nunimportant and characteristic contribution to our popular literature.\r\nOur Dutch neighbours have paid more attention to this subject, and a\r\ngreat number of their signboard inscriptions were, towards the close of\r\nthe seventeenth century, gathered in a curious little 12mo volume,[26]\r\nto which we shall often refer. Nay, so much attention was devoted to\r\nthis branch of literature in that country, that a certain H. van den\r\nBerg, in 1693, wrote a little volume,[27] which he entitled a “Banquet,”\r\ngiving verses adapted for all manner of shops and signboards; so that a\r\nshopkeeper at a loss for an inscription had only to open the book and\r\nmake his selection; for there were rhymes in it both serious and\r\njocular, suitable to everybody’s taste. The majority of the Dutch\r\nsignboard inscriptions of that day seem to have been eminently\r\ncharacteristic of the spirit of the nation. No such inscriptions could\r\nbe brought before “a discerning public,” without the patronage of some\r\nholy man mentioned in the Scriptures, whose name was to stand there for\r\nno other purpose than to give the Dutch poet an opportunity of making a\r\njingling rhyme; thus, for instance,--\r\n\r\n  “Jacob was David’s neef maar ’t waren geen Zwagers.\r\n  Hier slypt men allerhande Barbiers gereedschappen, ook voor vischwyven\r\n  en slagers.”[28]\r\n\r\nOr another example:--\r\n\r\n  “Men vischte Moses uit de Biezen,\r\n  Hier trekt men tanden en Kiezen.”[29]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the eighteenth century, we find the following signs\r\nnamed, which puzzled a person of an inquisitive turn of mind, who wrote\r\nto the _British Apollo_,[30] (the meagre _Notes and Queries_ of those\r\ndays,) in the hope of eliciting an explanation of their quaint\r\ncombination:--\r\n\r\n  “I’m amazed at the Signs\r\n  As I pass through the Town,\r\n  To see the odd mixture:\r\n  A Magpie and Crown,\r\n  The Whale and the Crow,\r\n  The Razor and Hen,\r\n  The Leg and Seven Stars,\r\n  The Axe and the Bottle,\r\n  The Tun and the Lute,\r\n  The Eagle and Child,\r\n  The Shovel and Boot.”\r\n\r\nAll these signs are also named by Tom Brown:[31]--“The first amusements\r\nwe encountered were the variety and contradictory language of the signs,\r\nenough to persuade a man there were no rules of concord among the\r\ncitizens. Here we saw Joseph’s Dream, the Bull and Mouth, the Whale and\r\nCrow, the Shovel and Boot, the Leg and Star, the Bible and Swan, the\r\nFrying-pan and Drum, the Lute and Tun, the Hog in Armour, and a\r\nthousand others that the wise men that put them there can give no reason\r\nfor.”\r\n\r\nFrom this enumeration, we see that a century had worked great changes in\r\nthe signs. Those of the beginning of the seventeenth century were all\r\nsimple, and had no combinations. But now we meet very heterogeneous\r\nobjects joined together. Various reasons can be found to account for\r\nthis. First, it must be borne in mind that most of the London signs had\r\nno inscription to tell the public “this is a lion,” or, “this is a\r\nbear;” hence the vulgar could easily make mistakes, and call an object\r\nby a wrong name, which might give rise to an absurd combination, as in\r\nthe case of the Leg and Star; which, perhaps, was nothing else but the\r\ntwo insignia of the order of the Garter; the garter being represented in\r\nits natural place, on the leg, and the star of the order beside it.\r\nSecondly, the name might be corrupted through faulty pronunciation; and\r\nwhen the sign was to be repainted, or imitated in another street, those\r\nobjects would be represented by which it was best known. Thus the Shovel\r\nand Boot might have been a corruption of the Shovel and Boat, since the\r\nShovel and Ship is still a very common sign in places where grain is\r\ncarried by canal boats; whilst the Bull and Mouth is said to be a\r\ncorruption of the Boulogne Mouth--the Mouth of Boulogne Harbour.\r\nFinally, whimsical shopkeepers would frequently aim at the most odd\r\ncombination they could imagine, for no other reason but to attract\r\nattention. Taking these premises into consideration, some of the signs\r\nwhich so puzzled Tom Brown might be easily accounted for; the Axe and\r\nBottle, in this way, might have been a corruption of the Battle-axe. The\r\nBible and Swan, a sign in honour of Luther, who is generally represented\r\nby the symbol of a swan, a figure of which many Lutheran Churches have\r\non their steeple instead of a weathercock; whilst the Lute and Tun was\r\nclearly a pun on the name of Luton, similar to the Bolt and Tun of Prior\r\nBolton, who adopted this device as his rebus.\r\n\r\nOther causes of combinations, and many very amusing and instructive\r\nremarks about signs, are given in the following from the _Spectator_,\r\nNo. 28, April 2, 1710:--\r\n\r\n“There is nothing like sound literature and good sense to be met with in\r\nthose objects, that are everywhere thrusting themselves out to the eye\r\nand endeavouring to become visible. Our streets are filled with _blue\r\nboars_, _black swans_, and _red lions_, not to mention _flying-pigs_\r\nand _hogs in armour_, with many creatures more extraordinary than any in\r\nthe deserts of Africa. Strange that one, who has all the birds and\r\nbeasts in nature to choose out of, should live at the sign of an _ens\r\nrationis_.\r\n\r\n“My first task, therefore, should be like that of Hercules, to clear the\r\ncity from monsters. In the second place, I should forbid that creatures\r\nof jarring and incongruous natures should be joined together in the same\r\nsign; such as the _Bell and the Neat’s Tongue_, the _Dog and the\r\nGridiron_. The _Fox and the Goose_ may be supposed to have met, but what\r\nhas the _Fox and the Seven Stars_ to do together? And when did the _Lamb\r\nand Dolphin_ ever meet except upon a signpost? As for the _Cat and\r\nFiddle_, there is a conceit in it, and therefore I do not intend that\r\nanything I have here said should affect it. I must, however, observe to\r\nyou upon this subject, that it is usual for a young tradesman, at his\r\nfirst setting up, to add to his own sign that of the master whom he\r\nserved, as the husband, after marriage, gives a place to his mistress’s\r\narms in his own coat. This I take to have given rise to many of those\r\nabsurdities which are committed over our heads; and, as I am informed,\r\nfirst occasioned the _Three Nuns and a Hare_, which we see so frequently\r\njoined together. I would therefore establish certain rules for the\r\ndetermining how far one tradesman may give the sign of another, and in\r\nwhat case he may be allowed to quarter it with his own.\r\n\r\n“In the third place, I would enjoin every shop to make use of a sign\r\nwhich bears some affinity to the wares in which it deals. What can be\r\nmore inconsistent than to see a bawd at the sign of the _Angel_, or a\r\ntailor at the _Lion_? A cook should not live at the _Boot_, nor a\r\nshoemaker at the _Roasted Pig_; and yet, for want of this regulation, I\r\nhave seen a _Goat_ set up before the door of a perfumer, and the _French\r\nKing’s Head_ at a sword-cutler’s.\r\n\r\n“An ingenious foreigner observes that several of those gentlemen who\r\nvalue themselves upon their families, and overlook such as are bred to\r\ntrades, bear the tools of their forefathers in their coats of arms. I\r\nwill not examine how true this is in fact; but though it may not be\r\nnecessary for posterity thus to set up the sign of their forefathers, I\r\nthink it highly proper that those who actually profess the trade should\r\nshew some such mark of it before their doors.\r\n\r\n“When the name gives an occasion for an ingenious signpost, I would\r\nlikewise advise the owner to take that opportunity of letting the world\r\nknow who he is. It would have been ridiculous for the ingenious Mrs\r\nSalmon to have lived at the sign of the trout, for which reason she has\r\nerected before her house the figure of the fish that is her namesake. Mr\r\nBell has likewise distinguished himself by a device of the same nature.\r\nAnd here, sir, I must beg leave to observe to you, that this particular\r\nfigure of a Bell has given occasion to several pieces of wit in this\r\nhead. A man of your reading must know that Abel Drugger gained great\r\napplause by it in the time of Ben Jonson. Our Apocryphal heathen god is\r\nalso represented by this figure, which, in conjunction with the\r\nDragon,[32] makes a very handsome picture in several of our streets. As\r\nfor the _Bell Savage_, which is the sign of a savage man standing by a\r\nbell, I was formerly very much puzzled upon the conceit of it, till I\r\naccidentally fell into the reading of an old romance translated out of\r\nthe French, which gives an account of a very beautiful woman, who was\r\nfound in a wilderness, and is called _la Belle Sauvage_, and is\r\neverywhere translated by our countrymen _the Bell Savage_.[33] This\r\npiece of philology will, I hope, convince you that I have made signposts\r\nmy study, and consequently qualified myself for the employment which I\r\nsolicit at your hands. But before I conclude my letter, I must\r\ncommunicate to you another remark which I have made upon the subject\r\nwith which I am now entertaining you--namely, that I can give a shrewd\r\nguess at the humour of the inhabitant by the sign that hangs before his\r\ndoor. A surly, choleric fellow generally makes choice of a _Bear_, as\r\nmen of milder dispositions frequently live at the _Lamb_. Seeing _a\r\nPunchbowl_ painted upon a sign near Charing Cross, and very curiously\r\ngarnished, with a couple of angels hovering over it and squeezing a\r\nlemon into it, I had the curiosity to ask after the master of the house,\r\nand found upon inquiry, as I had guessed by the little _agrémens_ upon\r\nhis sign, that he was a Frenchman.”\r\n\r\nAnother reason for “quartering” signs was on removing from one shop to\r\nanother, when it was customary to add the sign of the old shop to that\r\nof the new one.\r\n\r\n  “WHEREAS Anthony Wilton, who lived at the GREEN CROSS publick-house\r\n  against the new Turnpike on New Cross Hill, has been removed for two\r\n  years past to the new boarded house now the sign of the GREEN CROSS\r\n  AND KROSS KEYES on the same hill,” &c.--_Weekly Journal_, November 22,\r\n  1718.\r\n\r\n  “THOMAS BLACKALL and Francis Ives, Mercers, are removed from the SEVEN\r\n  STARS on Ludgate Hill to the BLACK LION AND SEVEN STARS over the\r\n  way.”--_Daily Courant_, November 17, 1718.\r\n\r\n  “PETER DUNCOMBE and Saunders Dancer, who lived at the NAKED BOY in\r\n  Great Russell Street, Covent Garden, removed to the NAKED BOY AND\r\n  MITRE, near Sommerset House, Strand,” &c.--_Postboy_, January 2-4,\r\n  1711.\r\n\r\n  “RICHARD MEARES, Musical Instrument maker, is removed from y’ GOLDEN\r\n  VIOL in Leaden Hall Street to y’ North side of St Paul’s Churchyard,\r\n  at y’ GOLDEN VIOL AND HAUTBOY, where he sells all sorts of musical\r\n  instruments,” &c.--[Bagford bills.]\r\n\r\nTo increase this complexity still more, came the corruption of names\r\narising from pronunciation; thus Mr Burn, in his introduction to the\r\n“Beaufoy Tokens,” mentions the sign of Pique and Carreau, on a\r\ngambling-house at Newport, Isle of Wight, which was Englished into the\r\nPig and Carrot; again, the same sign at Godmanchester was still more\r\nobliterated into the Pig and Checkers. The sign of the Island Queen I\r\nhave frequently heard, either in jest or in ignorance, called the\r\nIceland Queen. The editor of the recently-published “Slang Dictionary”\r\nremarks that he has seen the name of the once popular premier, George\r\nCanning, metamorphosed on an alehouse-sign into the George and Cannon;\r\nso the GOLDEN FARMER became the Jolly Farmer; whilst the Four Alls, in\r\nWhitechapel, were altered into the Four Awls. Along with this practice,\r\nthere is a tendency to translate a sign into a sort of jocular slang\r\nphrase; thus, in the seventeenth century, the BLACKMOORSHEAD AND\r\nWOOLPACK, in Pimlico, was called the DEVIL AND BAG OF NAILS by those\r\nthat frequented that tavern, and by the last part of that name the house\r\nis still called at the present day. Thus the Elephant and Castle is\r\nvulgarly rendered as the _Pig and Tinderbox_; the Bear and Ragged Staff,\r\nthe _Angel and Flute_; the Eagle and Child, the _Bird and Bantling_; the\r\nHog in Armour, the Pig in Misery; the Pig in the Pound, the _Gentleman\r\nin Trouble_, &c.\r\n\r\nSome further information, in illustration of the different signboards,\r\nis to be obtained from the _Adventurer_, No. 9, (1752:)--\r\n\r\n“It cannot be doubted but that signs were intended originally to express\r\nthe several occupations of their owners, and to bear some affinity in\r\ntheir external designations with the wares to be disposed of, or the\r\nbusiness carried on within. Hence the Hand and Shears is justly\r\nappropriated to tailors, and the Hand and Pen to writing-masters;\r\nthough the very reverend and right worthy order of my neighbours, the\r\nFleet-parsons, have assumed it to themselves as a mark of ‘marriages\r\nperformed without imposition.’ The Woolpack plainly points out to us a\r\nwoollen draper; the Naked Boy elegantly reminds us of the necessity of\r\nclothing; and the Golden Fleece figuratively denotes the riches of our\r\nstaple commodity; but are not the Hen and Chickens and the Three Pigeons\r\nthe unquestionable right of the poulterer, and not to be usurped by the\r\nvender of silk or linen?\r\n\r\n“It would be useless to enumerate the gross blunders committed in this\r\npoint by almost every branch of trade. I shall therefore confine myself\r\nchiefly to the numerous fraternity of publicans, whose extravagance in\r\nthis affair calls aloud for reprehension and restraint. Their modest\r\nancestors were contented with a plain Bough stuck up before their doors,\r\nwhence arose the wise proverb, ‘Good Wine needs no Bush;’ but how have\r\nthey since deviated from their ancient simplicity! They have ransacked\r\nearth, air, and seas, called down sun, moon, and stars to their\r\nassistance, and exhibited all the monsters that ever teemed from\r\nfantastic imagination. Their Hogs in Armour, their Blue Boars, Black\r\nBears, Green Dragons, and Golden Lions, have already been sufficiently\r\nexposed by your brother essay-writers:--\r\n\r\n            ‘Sus horridus, atraque Tigris,\r\n  Squamosusque Draco, et fulva cervice Leæna.\r\n\r\n  VIRGIL.\r\n\r\n  ‘With foamy tusks to seem a bristly boar,\r\n  Or imitate the lion’s angry roar;\r\n  Or kiss a dragon, or a tiger stare.’--DRYDEN.\r\n\r\n“It is no wonder that these gentlemen who indulged themselves in such\r\nunwarrantable liberties, should have so little regard to the choice of\r\nsigns adapted to their mystery. There can be no objection made to the\r\nBunch of Grapes, the Rummer, or the Tuns; but would not any one inquire\r\nfor a hosier at the Leg, or for a locksmith at the Cross Keys? and who\r\nwould expect anything but water to be sold at the Fountain? The\r\nTurkshead may fairly intimate that a seraglio is kept within; the Rose\r\nmay be strained to some propriety of meaning, as the business transacted\r\nthere may be said to be done ‘under the rose;’ but why must the Angel,\r\nthe Lamb, and the Mitre be the designations of the seats of drunkenness\r\nor prostitution?\r\n\r\n“Some regard should likewise be paid by tradesmen to their situation;\r\nor, in other words, to the propriety of the place; and in this, too,\r\nthe publicans are notoriously faulty. The King’s Arms, and the Star and\r\nGarter, are aptly enough placed at the court end of the town, and in the\r\nneighbourhood of the royal palace; Shakespeare’s Head takes his station\r\nby one playhouse, and Ben Jonson’s by the other; Hell is a public-house\r\nadjoining to Westminster Hall, as the Devil Tavern is to the lawyers’\r\nquarter in the Temple: but what has the Crown to do by the ’Change, or\r\nthe Gun, the Ship, or the Anchor anywhere but at Tower Hill, at Wapping,\r\nor Deptford?\r\n\r\n“It was certainly from a noble spirit of doing honour to a superior\r\ndesert, that our forefathers used to hang out the heads of those who\r\nwere particularly eminent in their professions. Hence we see Galen and\r\nParacelsus exalted before the shops of chemists; and the great names of\r\nTully, Dryden, and Pope, &c., immortalised on the rubric posts[34] of\r\nbooksellers, while their heads denominate the learned repositors of\r\ntheir works. But I know not whence it happens that publicans have\r\nclaimed a right to the physiognomies of kings and heroes, as I cannot\r\nfind out, by the most painful researches, that there is any alliance\r\nbetween them. Lebec, as he was an excellent cook, is the fit\r\nrepresentative of luxury; and Broughton, that renowned athletic\r\nchampion, has an indisputable right to put up his own head if he\r\npleases; but what reason can there be why the glorious Duke William\r\nshould draw porter, or the brave Admiral Vernon retail flip? Why must\r\nQueen Anne keep a ginshop, and King Charles inform us of a\r\nskittle-ground? Propriety of character, I think, require that these\r\nillustrious personages should be deposed from their lofty stations, and\r\nI would recommend hereafter that the alderman’s effigy should accompany\r\nhis Intire Butt Beer, and that the comely face of that public-spirited\r\npatriot who first reduced the price of punch and raised its reputation\r\n_Pro Bono Publico_, should be set up wherever three penn’orth of warm\r\nrum is to be sold.\r\n\r\n“I have been used to consider several signs, for the frequency of which\r\nit is difficult to give any other reason, as so many hieroglyphics with\r\na hidden meaning, satirising the follies of the people, or conveying\r\ninstruction to the passer-by. I am afraid that the stale jest on our\r\ncitizens gave rise to so many Horns in public streets; and the number of\r\nCastles floating with the wind was probably designed as a ridicule on\r\nthose erected by soaring projectors. Tumbledown Dick, in the borough of\r\nSouthwark, is a fine moral on the instability of greatness, and the\r\nconsequences of ambition; but there is a most ill-natured sarcasm\r\nagainst the fair sex exhibited on a sign in Broad Street, St Giles’s, of\r\na headless female figure called the Good Woman.\r\n\r\n  ‘Quale portentum neque militaris\r\n  Daunia in latis alit esculetis,\r\n  Nec Jubæ tellus generat, leonum\r\n  Arida Nutrix.’--HORACE.\r\n\r\n  ‘No beast of such portentous size\r\n  In warlike Daunia’s forest lies,\r\n  Nor such the tawny lion reigns\r\n  Fierce on his native Afric’s plains.’--FRANCIS.\r\n\r\n“A discerning eye may also discover in many of our signs evident marks\r\nof the religion prevalent amongst us before the Reformation. St George,\r\nas the tutelary saint of this nation, may escape the censure of\r\nsuperstition; but St Dunstan, with his tongs ready to take hold of\r\nSatan’s nose, and the legions of Angels, Nuns, Crosses, and Holy Lambs,\r\ncertainly had their origin in the days of Popery.\r\n\r\n“Among the many signs which are appropriated to some particular\r\nbusiness, and yet have not the least connexion with it, I cannot as yet\r\nfind any relation between blue balls and pawnbrokers. Nor could I\r\nconceive the intent of that long pole putting out at the entrance of a\r\nbarber’s shop, till a friend of mine, a learned etymologist and\r\nglossariographer, assured me that the use of this pole took its rise\r\nfrom the corruption of an old English word. ‘It is probable,’ says he,\r\n‘that our primitive tonsors used to stick up a wooden block or head, or\r\npoll, as it was called, before their shop windows, to denote their\r\noccupation; and afterwards, through a confounding of different things\r\nwith a like pronunciation, they put up the parti-coloured staff of\r\nenormous length, which is now called a pole, and appropriated to\r\nbarbers.’”[35]\r\n\r\nThe remarks of the _Adventurer_ have brought us down to the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth century, when the necessity for signs was not so great as\r\nformerly. Education was spreading fast, and reading had become a very\r\ngeneral acquirement; yet it would appear that the exhibitors of\r\nsignboards wished to make up in extravagance what they had lost in use.\r\n“Be it known, however, to posterity,” says a writer in the _Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine_, “that long after signs became unnecessary, it was not unusual\r\nfor an opulent shopkeeper to lay out as much upon a sign, and the\r\ncurious ironwork with which it was fixed in the house, so as to project\r\nnearly in the middle of the street, as would furnish a less considerable\r\ndealer with a stock in trade. I have been credibly informed that there\r\nwere many signs and sign irons upon Ludgate Hill which cost several\r\nhundred pounds, and that as much was laid out by a mercer on the sign of\r\nthe Queen’s Head, as would have gone a good way towards decorating the\r\noriginal for a birthday.” Misson, a French traveller who visited England\r\nin 1719, thus speaks about the signs:--\r\n\r\n  “By a decree of the police, the signs of Paris must be small, and not\r\n  too far advanced from the houses. At London, they are commonly very\r\n  large, and jut out so far, that in some narrow streets they touch one\r\n  another; nay, and run across almost quite to the other side. They are\r\n  generally adorned with carving and gilding; and there are several\r\n  that, with the branches of iron which support them, cost above a\r\n  hundred guineas. They seldom write upon the signs the name of the\r\n  thing represented in it, so that there is no need of Molière’s\r\n  inspector. But this does not at all please the German and other\r\n  travelling strangers; because, for want of the things being so named,\r\n  they have not an opportunity of learning their names in England, as\r\n  they stroll along the streets. Out of London, and particularly in\r\n  villages, the signs of inns are suspended in the middle of a great\r\n  wooden portal, which may be looked upon as a kind of triumphal arch to\r\n  the honour of Bacchus.”\r\n\r\nM. Grosley, another Frenchman, who made a voyage through England in\r\n1765, makes very similar remarks. As soon as he landed at Dover, he\r\nobserves,--\r\n\r\n  “I saw nothing remarkable, but the enormous size of the public-house\r\n  signs, the ridiculous magnificence of the ornaments with which they\r\n  are overcharged, the height of a sort of triumphal arches that support\r\n  them, and most of which cross the streets,” &c. Elsewhere he says, “In\r\n  fact nothing can be more inconsistent than the choice and the placing\r\n  of the ornaments, with which the signposts and the outside of the\r\n  shops of the citizens are loaded.”\r\n\r\nBut gaudy and richly ornamented as they were, it would seem that, after\r\nall, the pictures were bad, and that the absence of inscriptions was not\r\nto be lamented, for those that existed only “made fritters of English.”\r\nThe _Tatler_, No. 18, amused his readers at the expense of their\r\nspelling:--“There is an offence I have a thousand times lamented, but\r\nfear I shall never see remedied, which is that, in a nation where\r\nlearning is so frequent as in Great Britain, there should be so many\r\ngross errors as there are, in the very direction of things wherein\r\naccuracy is necessary for the conduct of life. This is notoriously\r\nobserved by all men of letters when they first come to town, (at which\r\ntime they are usually curious that way,) in the inscriptions on\r\nsignposts. I have cause to know this matter as well as anybody, for I\r\nhave, when I went to Merchant Taylor’s School, suffered stripes for\r\nspelling after the signs I observed in my way; though at the same time,\r\nI must confess, staring at those inscriptions first gave me an idea and\r\ncuriosity for medals, in which I have since arrived at some knowledge.\r\nMany a man has lost his way and his dinner, by this general want of\r\nskill in orthography; for, considering that the paintings are usually so\r\nvery bad that you cannot know the animal under whose sign you are to\r\nlive that day, how must the stranger be misled, if it is wrong spelled\r\nas well as ill painted? I have a cousin now in town, who has answered\r\nunder bachelor at Queen’s College, whose name is Humphrey Mopstaff, (he\r\nis akin to us by his mother;) this young man, going to see a relation in\r\nBarbican, wandered a whole day by the mistake of one letter; for it was\r\nwritten, ‘This is the Beer,’ instead of ‘This is the Bear.’ He was set\r\nright at last by inquiring for the house of a fellow who could not read,\r\nand knew the place mechanically, only by having been often drunk there.\r\n. . . I propose that every tradesman in the city of London and\r\nWestminster shall give me a sixpence a quarter for keeping their signs\r\nin repair as to the grammatical part; and I will take into my house a\r\nSwiss count[36] of my acquaintance, who can remember all their names\r\nwithout book, for despatch’ sake, setting up the head of the said\r\nforeigner for my sign, the features being strong and fit to hang high.”\r\n\r\nHad the signs murdered only the king’s English, it might have been\r\nforgiven; but even the lives of his majesty’s subjects were not secure\r\nfrom them; for, leaving alone the complaints raised about their\r\npreventing the circulation of fresh air, a more serious charge was\r\nbrought against them in 1718, when a sign in Bride’s Lane, Fleet Street,\r\nby its weight dragged down the front of the house, and in its fall\r\nkilled two young ladies, the king’s jeweller, and a cobbler. A\r\ncommission of inquiry into the nuisance was appointed; but, like most\r\ncommissions and committees, they talked a great deal and had some\r\ndinners; in the meantime the public interest and excitement abated, and\r\nmatters remained as they were.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1762 considerable attention was directed to signboards by\r\nBonnell Thornton, a clever wag, who, to burlesque the exhibitions of the\r\nSociety of Artists, got up an Exhibition of Signboards. In a preliminary\r\nadvertisement, and in his published catalogue, he described it as the\r\n“EXHIBITION OF THE SOCIETY OF SIGN-PAINTERS of all the curious signs to\r\nbe met with in town or country, together with such original designs as\r\nmight be transmitted to them, as specimens of the native genius of the\r\nnation.” Hogarth, who understood a joke as well as any man in England,\r\nentered into the spirit of the humour, was on the _hanging committee_,\r\nand added a few touches to heighten the absurdity. The whole affair\r\nproved a great success.[37]\r\n\r\nThis comical exhibition was the greatest glory to which signboards were\r\npermitted to attain, as not more than four years after they had a fall\r\nfrom which they never recovered. Education had now so generally spread,\r\nthat the majority of the people could read sufficiently well to decipher\r\na name and a number. The continual exhibition of pictures in the streets\r\nand thoroughfares consequently became useless; the information they\r\nconveyed could be imparted in a more convenient and simple manner,\r\nwhilst their evils could be avoided. The strong feeling of corporations,\r\ntoo, had set in steadily against signboards, and henceforth they were\r\ndoomed.\r\n\r\nParis, this time, set the example: by an act of September 17, 1761, M.\r\nde Sartines, Lieutenant de Police, ordered that, in a month’s time from\r\nthe publication of the act, all signboards in Paris and its suburbs were\r\nto be fixed against the walls of the houses, and not to project more\r\nthan four inches, including the border, frame, or other\r\nornaments;--also, all the signposts and sign irons were to be removed\r\nfrom the streets and thoroughfares, and the passage cleared.\r\n\r\nLondon soon followed: in the _Daily News_, November 1762, we find:--“The\r\nsigns in Duke’s Court, St Martin’s Lane, were all taken down and affixed\r\nto the front of the houses.” Thus Westminster had the honour to begin\r\nthe innovation, by procuring an act with ample powers to improve the\r\npavement, &c., of the streets; and this act also sealed the doom of the\r\nsignboards, which, as in Paris, were ordered to be affixed to the\r\nhouses. This was enforced by a statute of 2 Geo. III. c. 21, enlarged at\r\nvarious times. Other parishes were longer in making up their mind; but\r\nthe great disparity in the appearance of the streets westward from\r\nTemple Bar, and those eastward, at last made the Corporation of London\r\nfollow the example, and adopt similar improvements. Suitable powers to\r\ncarry out the scheme were soon obtained. In the 6 Geo. III. the Court of\r\nCommon Council appointed commissions, and in a few months all the\r\nparishes began to clear away: St Botolph in 1767; St Leonard,\r\nShoreditch, in 1768; St Martin’s-le-Grand in 1769; and Marylebone in\r\n1770.[38] By these acts--\r\n\r\n  “The commissioners are empowered to take down and remove all signs or\r\n  other emblems used to denote the trade, occupation, or calling of any\r\n  person or persons, signposts, signirons, balconies, penthouses,\r\n  showboards, spouts, and gutters, projecting into any of the said\r\n  streets, &c., and all other encroachments, projections, and annoyances\r\n  whatsoever, within the said cities and liberties, and cause the same,\r\n  or such parts thereof as they think fit, to be affixed or placed on\r\n  the fronts of the houses, shops, warehouses, or buildings to which\r\n  they belong, and return to the owner so much as shall not be put up\r\n  again or otherwise made use of in such alterations; and any person\r\n  having, placing, erecting, or building any sign, signpost, or other\r\n  post, signirons, balcony, penthouse, obstruction, or annoyance, is\r\n  subject to a penalty of £5, and twenty shillings a day for continuing\r\n  the same.”[39]\r\n\r\nWith the signboards, of course, went the signposts. The removing of the\r\nposts, and paving of the streets with Scotch granite, gave rise to the\r\nfollowing epigram:--\r\n\r\n  “The Scottish new pavement well deserves our praise;\r\n  To the Scotch we’re obliged, too, for mending our ways;\r\n  But this we can never forgive, for they say\r\n  As that they have taken our posts all away.”\r\n\r\nAfter the signs and posts had been removed, we can imagine how bleak and\r\nempty the streets at first appeared; how silent in the night-time; what\r\na difficulty there must have been in finding out the houses and shops;\r\nand how everybody, particularly the old people, grumbled about the\r\ninnovations.\r\n\r\nNow _numbers_ appeared everywhere. As early as 1512 an attempt had been\r\nmade in Paris at numbering sixty-eight new houses, built in that year on\r\nthe Pont Nôtre-Dame, which were all distinguished by 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.;\r\nyet more than two centuries elapsed before the numerical arrangement was\r\ngenerally adopted. In 1787 the custom in France had become almost\r\nuniversal, but was not enforced by police regulations until 1805. In\r\nLondon it appears to have been attempted in the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century; for in Hatton’s “New View of London,” 1708, we see\r\nthat “in Prescott Street, Goodman’s Fields, instead of signs the houses\r\nare distinguished by numbers, as the staircases in the Inns of Court and\r\nChancery.” In all probability reading was not sufficiently widespread at\r\nthat time to bring this novelty into general practice. Yet how much more\r\nsimple is the method of numbering, for giving a clear and unmistakable\r\ndirection, may be seen from the means resorted to to indicate a house\r\nunder the signboard system; as for instance:--\r\n\r\n  “TO BE LETT, Newbury House, in St James’s Park, next door but one to\r\n  Lady Oxford’s, having two balls at the gate, and iron rails before the\r\n  door,” &c., &c.--Advertisement in the original edition of the\r\n  _Spectator_, No. 207.\r\n\r\n  “AT HER HOUSE, the RED BALL AND ACORN, over against the GLOBE Tavern,\r\n  in Queen Street, Cheapside, near the _Three Crowns_, liveth a\r\n  Gentlewoman,” &c.\r\n\r\nAt night the difficulty of finding a house was greatly increased, for\r\nthe light of the lamps was so faint that the signs, generally hung\r\nrather high, could scarcely be discerned. Other means, therefore, were\r\nresorted to, as we see from the advertisement of “Doctor James Tilbrogh,\r\na German Doctor,” who resides “over against the New Exchange in Bedford\r\nStreet, at the sign of the Peacock, where you shall see at night two\r\ncandles burning within one of the chambers before the balcony, and a\r\nlanthorn with a candle in it upon the balcony.” And in that strain all\r\ndirections were given: _over against_, or _next door to_, were among the\r\nconsecrated formulæ. Hence many dispensed with a picture of their own,\r\nand clung, like parasites, to the sign opposite or next door,\r\nparticularly if it was a shop of some note. Others resorted to painting\r\ntheir houses, doors, balconies, or doorposts, in some striking colour;\r\nhence those Red, Blue, or White Houses still so common; hence also the\r\nBlue Posts and the Green Posts. So we find a Dark House in Chequer\r\nAlley, Moorfields, a Green Door in Craven Building, and a Blue Balcony\r\nin Little Queen Street, all of which figure on the seventeenth century\r\ntrades tokens.[40] Those who did much trade by night, as coffee-houses,\r\nquacks, &c., adopted lamps with coloured glasses, by which they\r\ndistinguished their houses. This custom has come down to us, and is\r\nstill adhered to by doctors, chemists, public-houses, and occasionally\r\nby sweeps.\r\n\r\nYet, though the numbers were now an established fact, the shopkeepers\r\nstill clung to the old traditions, and for years continued to display\r\ntheir signs, grand, gorgeous, and gigantic as ever, though affixed to\r\nthe houses. As late as 1803, a traveller thus writes about London:--“As\r\nit is one of the principal secrets of the trade to attract the attention\r\nof that tide of people which is constantly ebbing and flowing in the\r\nstreets, it may easily be conceived that great pains are taken to give a\r\nstriking form to the signs and devices hanging out before their shops.\r\nThe whole front of a house is frequently employed for this purpose.\r\nThus, in the vicinity of Ludgate Hill, the house of S----, who has\r\namassed a fortune of £40,000 by selling razors, is daubed with large\r\ncapitals three feet high, acquainting the public that ‘the most\r\nexcellent and superb patent razors are sold here.’ As soon, therefore,\r\nas a shop has acquired some degree of reputation, the younger brethren\r\nof the trade copy its device. A grocer in the city, who had a large\r\n_Beehive_ for his sign hanging out before his shop, had allured a great\r\nmany customers. No sooner were the people seen swarming about this hive\r\nthan the old signs suddenly disappeared, and Beehives, elegantly gilt,\r\nwere substituted in their places. Hence the grocer was obliged to insert\r\nan advertisement in the newspapers, importing ‘that he was the sole\r\nproprietor of the original and celebrated _Beehive_.’ A similar accident\r\nbefell the shop of one E---- in Cheapside, who has a considerable demand\r\nfor his goods on account of their cheapness and excellence. The sign of\r\nthis gentleman consists in a prodigious _Grasshopper_, and as this\r\ninsect had quickly propagated its species through every part of the\r\ncity, Mr E---- has in his advertisements repeatedly requested the public\r\nto observe that ‘the genuine Grasshopper is only to be found before his\r\nwarehouse.’ He has, however, been so successful as to persuade several\r\nyoung beginners to enter into engagements with him, on conditions very\r\nadvantageous to himself, by which they have obtained a licence for\r\nhanging out the sign of a Grasshopper before their shops, expressly\r\nadding this clause in large capitals, that ‘they are genuine descendants\r\nof the renowned and matchless Grasshopper of Mr E---- in\r\nCheapside.’”[41]\r\n\r\nSuch practices as these, however, necessarily gave the deathblow to\r\nsignboards; for, by reason of this imitation on the part of rival\r\nshopkeepers, the main object--distinction and notoriety--was lost. How\r\nwas a stranger to know which of those innumerable Beehives in the Strand\r\nwas _the_ Beehive; or which of all those “genuine Grasshoppers” was THE\r\ngenuine one? So, gradually, the signs began to dwindle away, first in\r\nthe principal streets, then in the smaller thoroughfares and the\r\nsuburbs; finally, in the provincial towns also. The publicans only\r\nretained them, and even they in the end were satisfied with the name\r\nwithout the sign, _vox et præterea nihil_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.\r\n\r\nMERMAID.

(Circa 1700.)\r\n\r\nHOG IN ARMOUR.]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century signs had been sung in sprightly ballads, and\r\noften given the groundwork for a biting satire. They continued to\r\ninspire the popular Muse until the end, but her latter productions were\r\nmore like a wail than a ballad. There is certainly a rollicking air of\r\ngladness about the following song, but it was the last flicker of the\r\nlamp:--\r\n\r\n“THE MAIL-COACH GUARD.\r\n\r\n  At each inn on the road I a welcome could find:--\r\n    At the _Fleece_ I’d my skin full of ale;\r\n  The _Two Jolly Brewers_ were just to my mind;\r\n    At the _Dolphin_ I drank like a whale.\r\n  Tom Tun at the _Hogshead_ sold pretty good stuff;\r\n    They’d capital flip at the _Boar_;\r\n  And when at the _Angel_ I’d tippled enough,\r\n    I went to the _Devil_ for more.\r\n  Then I’d always a sweetheart so snug at the _Car_;\r\n    At the _Rose_ I’d a lily so white;\r\n  Few planets could equal sweet _Nan_ at the _Star_,\r\n    No eyes ever twinkled so bright.\r\n  I’ve had many a hug at the sign of the _Bear_;\r\n    In the _Sun_ courted morning and noon;\r\n  And when night put an end to my happiness there,\r\n    I’d a sweet little girl in the _Moon_.\r\n  To sweethearts and ale I at length bid adieu,\r\n    Of wedlock to set up the sign:\r\n  _Hand-in-hand_ the _Good Woman_ I look for in you,\r\n    And the _Horns_ I hope ne’er will be mine.\r\n  Once guard to the mail, I’m now guard to the fair;\r\n    But though my commission’s laid down,\r\n  Yet while the _King’s Arms_ I’m permitted to bear,\r\n    Like a _Lion_ I’ll fight for the _Crown_.”\r\n\r\nThis was written in the beginning of the century, when eighteen hundred\r\nwas still in her teens. A considerable falling off may be observed in\r\nthe following, contributed by a correspondent of William Hone:--\r\n\r\n“SIGNS OF LOVE AT OXFORD.\r\n\r\n_By an Inn-consolable Lover._\r\n\r\n  She’s as light as _The Greyhound_, as fair as _The Angel_,\r\n  Her looks than _The Mitre_ more sanctified are;\r\n  But she flies like _The Roebuck_, and leaves me to range ill,\r\n  Still looking to her as my true polar _Star_.\r\n  New _Inn_-ventions I try, with new art to adore,\r\n  But my fate is, alas, to be voted a _Boar_;\r\n  My _Goats_ I forsook to contemplate her charms,\r\n  And must own she is fit for our noble _King’s Arms_;\r\n  Now _Cross’d_, and now Jockey’d, now sad, now elate,\r\n  _The Checquers_ appear but a map of my fate;\r\n  I blush’d like a _Blue Cur_, to send her a _Pheasant_,\r\n  But she call’d me a _Turk_, and rejected my present;\r\n  So I moped to _The Barley Mow_, grieved in my mind,\r\n  That _The Ark_ from the Flood ever rescued mankind!\r\n  In my dreams _Lions_ roar, and _The Green Dragon_ grins,\r\n  And fiends rise in shape of _The Seven Deadly Sins_,\r\n  When I ogle _The Bells_, should I see her approach,\r\n  I skip like a _Nag_ and jump into _The Coach_.\r\n  She is crimson and white like a _Shoulder of Mutton_,\r\n  Not the _red_ of _The Ox_ was so bright when first put on;\r\n  Like _The Holly-bush_ prickles she scratches my liver,\r\n  While I moan and die like a _Swan_ by the river.”\r\n\r\nBut tame as this last performance is, it is “merry as a brass band” when\r\ncompared with a ballad sung in the streets some twenty years later,\r\nentitled, “Laughable and Interesting Picture of Drunkenness.” Speaking\r\nof the publicans, who call themselves “Lords,” it says:--\r\n\r\n  “If these be the Lords, there are many kinds,\r\n  For over their doors you will see many signs;\r\n  There is _The King_, and likewise _The Crown_,\r\n  And beggars are made in every town.\r\n\r\n  There is _The Queen_, and likewise her _Head_,\r\n  And many I fear to the gallows are led;\r\n  There is _The Angel_, and also _The Deer_,\r\n  Destroying health in every sphere.\r\n\r\n  There is _The Lamb_, likewise _The Fleece_,\r\n  And the fruit’s bad throughout the whole piece;\r\n  There is _The White Hart_, also _The Cross Keys_,\r\n  And many they’ve sent far over the seas.\r\n\r\n  There is _The Bull_, and likewise his _Head_.\r\n  His _Horns_ are so strong, they will gore you quite dead;\r\n  There’s _The Hare and Hounds_ that never did run,\r\n  And many’s been hung for the deeds they’ve done.\r\n\r\n  There are _Two Fighting Cocks_ that never did crow,\r\n  Where men often meet to break God’s holy vow;\r\n  There is _The New Inn_, and the _Rodney_ they say,\r\n  Which send men to jail their debts for to pay.\r\n\r\n  _The Hope_ and _The Anchor_, _The Turk_ and his _Head_,\r\n  Hundreds they’ve caused for to wander for bread;\r\n  There is _The White Horse_, also _The Woolpack_,\r\n  Take the shoes off your feet, and the clothes off your back.\r\n\r\n  _The Axe and the Cleaver_, _The Jockey and Horse_,\r\n  Some they’ve made idle, some they’ve made worse;\r\n  _The George and the Dragon_, and _Nelson_ the brave,\r\n  Many lives they’ve shorten’d and brought to the grave.\r\n\r\n  _The Fox and the Goose_, and _The Guns_ put _across_,\r\n  But all the craft is to get hold of the brass;\r\n  _The Bird in the Cage_, and the sign of _The Thrush_,\r\n  But one in the hand is worth two in the bush.”\r\n\r\nThere is an unpleasant musty air about this ballad, a taint of Seven\r\nDials, an odour of the ragged dresscoat, and the broken, ill-used hat.\r\nThe gay days of signboard poetry, when sparks in feathers and ruffles\r\nsang their praises, are no more. Our forefathers were content to buy “at\r\nthe Golden Frying-pan,” but we must needs go to somebody’s emporium,\r\nmart, repository, or make our purchases at such grand places as the\r\nPantocapelleion, Pantometallurgicon, or Panklibanon. The corruptions and\r\nmisapplications of the old pictorial signboards find a parallel in the\r\nmodern rendering of our ancient proverbs and sayings. When the primary\r\nuse and purpose of an article have fallen out of fashion, or become\r\nobsolete, there is no knowing how absurdly it may not be treated by\r\nsucceeding generations. We were once taken many miles over fields and\r\nthrough lanes to see the great stone coffins of some ancient Romans, but\r\nthe farmer, a sulky man, thought we were impertinent in wishing to see\r\nhis pig-troughs. In Haarlem, we were once shewn the huge cannon-ball\r\nwhich killed Heemskerk, the discoverer of Nova Zembla. When not required\r\nfor exhibition, however, the good man in charge found it of great use in\r\ngrinding his mustard-seed. Amongst the middle classes of to-day, no\r\ninstitution of ancient times has been more corrupted and misapplied than\r\nheraldry. The modern “Forrester,” or member of the “Ancient Order of\r\nDruids,” is scarcely a greater burlesque upon the original than the beer\r\nretailers’ “Arms” of the present hour.\r\n\r\nGood wine and beer were formerly to be had at the Boar’s Head, or the\r\nThree Tuns; but those emblems will not do now, it must be the “Arms” of\r\nsomebody or something; whence we find such anomalies as the _Angel\r\nArms_, (Clapham Road;) _Dunstan’s Arms_, (City Road;) _Digger’s Arms_,\r\n(Petworth, Surrey;) _Farmer’s Arms_ and _Gardener’s Arms_, (Lancashire;)\r\n_Grand Junction Arms_, (Praed Street, London;) _Griffin’s Arms_,\r\n(Warrington;) _Mount Pleasant Arms_, _Paragon Arms_, (Kingston, Surrey;)\r\n_St Paul’s Arms_, (Newcastle;) _Portcullis Arms_, (Ludlow;) _Puddler’s\r\nArms_, (Wellington, Shropshire;) _Railway Arms_, (Ludlow;) _Sol’s Arms_,\r\n(Hampstead Row;) the _Vulcan Arms_, (Sheffield;) _General’s Arms_,\r\n(Little Baddon, Essex;) the _Waterloo Arms_, (High Street, Marylebone,)\r\n&c. Besides these, a quantity of newfangled, high-sounding, but\r\nunmeaning names seem to be the order of the day with gin-palaces and\r\nrefreshment-houses, as, _Perseverance_, _Enterprise_, _Paragon_,\r\n_Criterion_.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these innovations, the majority of the old objects still\r\nsurvive, in name at least, on the signboards of alehouses and taverns.\r\nTheir use may still be regarded as a rule with publicans and innkeepers,\r\nalthough they have become the exception in other trades. Occasionally,\r\nalso, we may still come upon a painted signboard, but these are daily\r\nbecoming scarcer. Not so in France; there the good old tradition of the\r\npainted signboard is yet kept up. We get a good glimpse of this subject\r\nin the following:[42]--“But it is the signs that so amuse and absolutely\r\narrest a stranger. This is a practice that has grown into a mania at\r\nParis, and is even a subject for the ridicule of the stage, since many a\r\nshopkeeper considers his sign as a primary matter, and spends a little\r\ncapital in this one outfit. Many of them exhibit figures as large as\r\nlife, painted in no humble or shabby style; while history, sacred and\r\nclassical, religion, the stage, &c., furnish subjects. You may see the\r\n_Horatii_ and _Curiatii_--a scene from the ‘Fourberies de Scapin’ of\r\nMolière--a group of French soldiers, with the inscription, _A la Valeur\r\ndes Soldats Français_, or a group of children inscribed _à la réunion\r\ndes Bons Enfants_,[43]--or _à la Baigneuse_, depicting a beautiful nymph\r\njust issuing from the bath; or _à la Somnambule_, a pretty girl walking\r\nin her sleep and nightdress, and followed by her gallant.[44]\r\n\r\n“In ludicrous things, a barber will write under his sign:--\r\n\r\n  ‘La Nature donne barbe et cheveux,\r\n  Et moi, je les coupe tous les deux.’[45]\r\n\r\n  ‘A toutes les figures dédiant mes rasoirs,\r\n  Je nargue la censure des fidèles miroirs.’[46]\r\n\r\n“Also a frequent inscription with a barber is, ‘Ici on rajeunit.’ A\r\nbreeches-maker writes up, _M----, Culottier de Mme. la Duchesse de\r\nDevonshire_. A _perruquier_ exhibits a sign, very well painted, of an\r\nold fop trying on a new wig, entitled, _Au ci-devant jeune homme_. A\r\nbutcher displays a bouquet of faded flowers, with this inscription, _Au\r\ntendre Souvenir_. An eating-house exhibits a punning sign, with an ox\r\ndressed up with bonnet, lace veil, shawl, &c., which naturally implies,\r\n_Bœuf à-la-mode_. A pastry-cook has a very pretty little girl climbing\r\nup to reach some cakes in a cupboard, and this sign he calls, _A la\r\npetite Gourmande_. A stocking-maker has painted for him a lovely\r\ncreature, trying on a new stocking, at the same time exhibiting more\r\ncharms than the occasion requires to the young fellow who is on his\r\nknees at her feet, with the very significant motto, _A la belle\r\noccasion_.”[47]\r\n\r\nThough it is forty years since these remarks were written, they still,\r\n_mutatis mutandis_, apply to the present day. Even the greatest and most\r\nfashionable shops on the Boulevards have their names or painted signs;\r\nthe subjects are mostly taken from the principal topic of conversation\r\nat the time the establishment opened, whether politics, literature, the\r\ndrama, or fine arts: thus we have _à la Présidence_; _au Prophète_; _au\r\nPalais d’Industrie_; _aux Enfants d’Edouard_, (the Princes in the\r\nTower;) _au Colosse de Rhodes_; _à la Tour de Malakoff_; _à la Tour de\r\nNesles_, (tragedy;) _au Sonneur de St Paul_, (tragedy;) _à la Dame\r\nBlanche_; _à la Bataille de Solferino_; _au Trois Mousquetaires_; _au\r\nLingot d’Or_, (a great lottery swindle in 1852;) _à la Reine Blanche_,\r\n&c.[48] Some of these signs are remarkably well painted, in a vigorous,\r\nbold style, with great bravura of brush; for instance, _les Noces de\r\nVulcain_, on the Quai aux Fleurs, is painted in a style which would do\r\nno discredit to the artist of _les Romains de la Décadence_. _Roger\r\nBontemps_ is still frequent on the French signboard, where he is\r\nrepresented as a jolly rubicund toper, crowned with vine-leaves and\r\nseated astride a tun, with a brimming tumbler in his hand; this is a\r\nfavourite sign with publicans. At the tobacconist’s door we may see a\r\nsign representing an elderly Paul Pry-looking gentleman enjoying a pinch\r\nof snuff. The _Bureaux des Remplacements Militaires_ particularly excel\r\nin a gaudy display of military subjects, where the various passages of a\r\nsoldier’s life are represented with all the romance of the warriors of\r\nthe comic opera. Here can be seen the gallant troopers now courting\r\nJeanette or Fanchon; now charging Russians, Cabyles, or Austrians,\r\naccording to the date of the picture. Elsewhere a lancer on a fantastic\r\nwild horse; a guide, walking with a pretty _vivandière_, or an old\r\ngrenadier with the Legion of Honour upon his breast;--“all the glorious\r\npomp and circumstance of war” portrayed to entice the French clodhopper\r\nto sell himself “to death or to glory.” More pacific pictures may be\r\nobserved at the door of the midwife; there we see a sedate-looking\r\nmatron in ecstasy over the interesting young stranger she has just\r\nushered forth into the world, whilst paterfamilias stands with a\r\ntriumphant look in the background. Then there is the Herculean\r\ncoalheaver at the door of the _auvergnat_, who sells coals and firewood;\r\nand landscapes with cattle at the dairyshops. But amongst the best\r\npainted are those at the doors of the _marchands de vins et de\r\ncomestibles_, where we see frequently bunches of fruit, game, flowers,\r\nglasses, hams, fowls, fish, all cleverly grouped together, and painted\r\nin a dashing style. There is one, for instance, in the Rue Bellechasse,\r\nand another in the Rue St Lazare, that are well worth inspection. These\r\npaintings are generally on the door-posts and window-frames; they are\r\npainted on thin white canvas, fixed with varnish at the back of a thick\r\npiece of plateglass, and so let into the woodwork.\r\n\r\nAnd now a few words concerning the painters of signs. Their\r\nhead-quarters were in Harp Alley, Shoe Lane, where, until lately, gilt\r\ngrapes, sugar-loaves, lasts, teapots, &c., &c., were displayed ready for\r\nthe market. Here Messrs Barlow, Craddock, and others, whose names are\r\nnow as completely lost as their works, had their studios, and produced\r\nsome very creditable signs, both carved and painted. A few, however,\r\nwere the productions of no mean artists. The _Spectator_, January 8,\r\n1743, No. 744, says:--\r\n\r\n  “The other day, going down Ludgate Street, several people were gaping\r\n  at a very splendid sign of Queen Elizabeth, which by far exceeded all\r\n  the other signs in the street, the painter having shewn a masterly\r\n  judgment and the carver and gilder much pomp and splendour. It looked\r\n  rather like a capital picture in a gallery than a sign in the street.”\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the name of the artist who painted this has not come down\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nThose who produced the best signs, however, were not exactly the Harp\r\nAlley sign-painters, but the coach-painters, who often united these two\r\nbranches of art. In the last century, both the coaches and sedans of the\r\nwealthy classes were walking picture galleries, the panels being painted\r\nwith all sorts of subjects.[49] And when the men that painted these\r\nturned their hands to sign-painting, they were sure to produce something\r\ngood. Such was Clarkson, to whom J. T. Smith ascribed the beautiful sign\r\nof Shakespeare that formerly hung in Little Russell Street, Drury Lane,\r\nfor which he was paid £500.--John Baker, (_ob._ 1771,) who studied under\r\nthe same master as Catton, and was made a member of the Royal Academy at\r\nits foundation.--Charles Catton (_ob._ 1798) painted several very good\r\nsigns, particularly a Lion for his friend Wright, a famous coachmaker,\r\nat that time living in Long Acre. This picture, though it had weathered\r\nmany a storm, was still to be seen in J. T. Smith’s time, at a\r\ncoachmaker’s on the west side of Well Street, Oxford Street. A Turk’s\r\nhead, painted by him, was long admired as the sign of a mercer in York\r\nStreet, Covent Garden.--John Baptist Cipriani, (_ob._ 1785,) a\r\nFlorentine carriage-painter, living in London, also a Royal\r\nAcademician.--Samuel Wale, R.A. (_ob._ 1786) painted a celebrated\r\nFalstaff and various other signs; the principal one was a whole length\r\nof Shakespeare, about five feet high, which was executed for and\r\ndisplayed at the door of a public-house at the north-west corner of\r\nLittle Russell Street, Drury Lane. It was enclosed in a most sumptuous\r\ncarved gilt frame, and was suspended by rich ironwork. But this splendid\r\nobject of attraction did not hang long before it was taken down, in\r\nconsequence of the Act of Parliament for removing the signs and other\r\nobstructions in the streets of London. Such was the change in the public\r\nappreciation consequent on the new regulations in signs, that this\r\nrepresentation of our great dramatic poet was sold for a trifle to Mason\r\nthe broker in Lower Grosvenor Street, where it stood at his door for\r\nseveral years, until it was totally destroyed by the weather and other\r\naccidents.[50]\r\n\r\nThe universal use of signboards furnished no little employment for the\r\ninferior rank of painters, and sometimes even to the superior\r\nprofessors. Among the most celebrated practitioners in this branch was a\r\nperson of the name of Lamb, who possessed considerable ability. His\r\npencil was bold and masterly, and well adapted to the subjects on which\r\nit was generally employed. There was also Gwynne, another coach-painter,\r\nwho acquired some reputation as a marine painter, and produced a few\r\ngood signs. Robert Dalton, keeper of the pictures of King George III.,\r\nhad been apprenticed to a sign and coach-painter; so were Ralph Kirby,\r\ndrawing-master to George IV. when Prince of Wales, Thomas Wright of\r\nLiverpool, the marine painter, Smirke, R.A., and many artists who\r\nacquired considerable after-reputation.\r\n\r\nPeter Monamy (_ob._ 1749) was apprenticed to a sign and house-painter on\r\nLondon Bridge. It was this artist who decorated the carriage of Admiral\r\nByng with ships and naval trophies, and painted a portrait of Admiral\r\nVernon’s ship for a famous public-house of the day, well known by the\r\nsign of the _Portobello_, a few doors north of the church in St Martin’s\r\nLane.[51]\r\n\r\nBesides these, we have the “great professors,” as Edwards calls them,\r\nwho occasionally painted a sign for a freak. At the head of these stands\r\nHogarth, whose Man loaded with Mischief is still to be seen at 414\r\nOxford Street, where it is a fixture in the alehouse of that name.\r\n\r\nRichard Wilson, R.A., (_ob._ 1782,) painted the Three Loggerheads for an\r\nalehouse in North Wales, which gave its name to the village of\r\nLoggerheads, near the town of Mould. The painting was still exhibited as\r\na signboard in 1824, though little of Wilson’s work remained, as it had\r\nbeen repeatedly touched up.\r\n\r\nGeorge Morland painted several; the Goat in Boots on the Fulham Road is\r\nattributed to him, but has since been painted often over; he also\r\npainted a White Lion for an inn at Paddington, where he used to carouse\r\nwith his boon companions, Ibbetson and Rathbone; and in a small\r\npublic-house near Chelsea Bridge, Surrey, there was, as late as 1824, a\r\nsign of the Cricketers painted by him. This painting by Morland, at the\r\ndate mentioned, had been removed inside the house, and a copy of it hung\r\nup for the sign; unfortunately, however, the landlord used to travel\r\nabout with the original, and put it up before his booth at Staines and\r\nEgham races, cricket matches, and similar occasions.\r\n\r\nIbbetson painted a sign for the village alehouse at Troutbeck, near\r\nAmbleside, to settle a bill run up in a sketching, fishing, and\r\n_dolce-far-niente_ expedition; the sign represented two faces, the one\r\nthin and pale, the other jolly and rubicund; under it was the following\r\nrhyme:--\r\n\r\n  “Thou mortal man that liv’st by bread,\r\n  What made thy face to look so red?\r\n\r\n  Thou silly fop, that looks so pale,\r\n  ’Tis red with Tommy Burkett’s ale.”[52]\r\n\r\nDavid Cox painted a Royal Oak for the alehouse at Bettws-y-Coed,\r\nDenbighshire; fortunately this has been taken down, and is now preserved\r\nbehind glass inside the inn.\r\n\r\nThe elder Crome produced a sign of the Sawyers at St Martins, Norwich;\r\nit was afterwards taken down by the owner, framed, and hung up as a\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nAt New Inn Lane, Epsom, Harlow painted a front and a back view of Queen\r\nCharlotte, to settle a bill he had run up; he imitated Sir Thomas\r\nLawrence’s style, and signed it “T. L.,” Greek Street, Soho. When\r\nLawrence heard this, he got in a terrible rage and said, if Harlow were\r\nnot a scoundrel, he would kick him from one street’s end to the other;\r\nupon which Harlow very coolly remarked, that when Sir Thomas should make\r\nup his mind to it, he hoped he would choose a short street.\r\n\r\nIn his younger days Sir Charles Ross painted a sign of the Magpie at\r\nSudbury, and the landlady of the house, with no small pride, gave the\r\ninformant to understand that, more than thirty years after, the\r\naristocratic portrait-painter came in a carriage to her house, and asked\r\nto be shewn the old sign once more.\r\n\r\nHerring is said to have painted some signs. Amongst them are the Flying\r\nDutchman, at Cottage Green, Camberwell, and a White Lion at Doncaster;\r\nunderneath the last are the words,--“_Painted by Herring_.”\r\n\r\nMillais painted a Saint George and Dragon, with grapes round it, for the\r\nVidler’s Inn, Hayes, Kent; and we learn that a sign at Singleton,\r\nLancashire, was painted by an R.A. and an R.S., each painting one side\r\nof it; on the front was represented a wearied pilgrim, at the back the\r\nsame refreshed, but the sign was never hung up.\r\n\r\nGreat men of former ages, also, are known to have painted signs; in the\r\nmuseum at Basle, in Switzerland, there are two pictures of a school,\r\npainted by Holbein when fourteen years old, for a sign of the\r\nschoolmaster of the town. The Mule and Muleteer in the Sutherland\r\ncollection, is said to have been painted by Correggio as a sign for an\r\ninn; a similar legend is told about the Young Bull of Paul Potter, in\r\nthe museum of the Hague, in Holland, which is reported to have been\r\npainted for a butcher’s signboard. The Chaste Susannah (_la chaste\r\nSusanne_) was formerly a fine stone bas-relief in the Rue aux Fèves,\r\nParis; it was attributed to Goujon, and bought as such by an amateur. A\r\nplaster cast of it now occupies its place. Watteau executed a sign for a\r\nmilliner on the Pont Nôtre-Dame, which was thought sufficiently good to\r\nbe engraved. Horace Vernet has the name of having produced some signs in\r\nhis younger days; and there is still at the present time a sign of the\r\nWhite Horse, in one of the villages in the neighbourhood of Paris, which\r\nis pointed out as a work of Guéricault.\r\n\r\nBesides these, there are, and have been at various times, excellent\r\nsignboards in Paris, the artists of which are not known. Thus there was,\r\nin the beginning of the eighteenth century, a sign at the foot of the\r\nPont Neuf, called _le Petit Dunkerque_, which was greatly admired; and\r\nin the reign of Louis XV. an armourer on the Pont Saint Michel had a\r\nsign, which was so fine a work of art that it was bought as a cabinet\r\npicture by a wealthy citizen. In the beginning of this century there was\r\na much admired sign on the shutters of a glass and china shop in the Rue\r\nRoyale St Honoré, which unfortunately was destroyed during some repairs\r\nthat took place upon the building passing into other hands. In 1808, the\r\nsign of _la Fille mal gardée_, (a vaudeville,) at a mercer’s, attracted\r\ngreat attention. About this period the Rue Vivienne was very rich in\r\ngood signboards; there were _la Toison de Cachemire_; _les Trois\r\nSultanes_; _le Couronnement de la Rosière_, and _la Joconde_, all very\r\ngood works of art. There was a gay _Comte Ory_ on the Boulevard des\r\nItaliens, and _la Blanche Marguerite_, most comely to look upon, in the\r\nRue Montmartre. All these are now gone, but many good specimens of\r\nFrench signboard painting may yet be met with.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this general survey of signboard history, we must direct\r\nattention to the number of streets named after signs, both in England\r\nand abroad. A walk down Fleet Street will give, in a small compass, as\r\nmany illustrations as are to be met with in any other thoroughfare in\r\ntown, for there nearly all the courts are named after signs that were\r\neither hung within them, or at their entrance. Not only streets, but\r\nfamilies also have to thank signs for their names.\r\n\r\n  “Many names that seem unfitting for men, as of brutish beasts, etc.,\r\n  come from the very signes of the houses where they inhabited; for I\r\n  have heard of them which sayd they spake of knowledge, that some in\r\n  late time dwelling at the signe of the Dolphin, Bull, White Horse,\r\n  Racket, Peacocke, etc., were commonly called Thomas at the Dolphin,\r\n  Will at the Bull, George at the White Horse, Robin at the Racket,\r\n  which names, as many other of like sort, with omitting _at the_,\r\n  became afterwards hereditary to their children.”--CAMDEN’S _Remaines_,\r\n  p. 102.\r\n\r\nAs examples of such names we have, “Arrow, Axe, Barrell, Bullhead, Bell,\r\nBlock, Board, Banner, Bowles, Baskett, Cann, Coulter, Chisell, Clogg,\r\nCrosskeys, Crosier, Funnell, Forge, Firebrand, Grapes, Griffin, Horns,\r\nHammer, Hamper, Hodd, Harrow, Image, (the sign originally in honour of\r\nsome saint perhaps,) Jugg, Kettle, Knife, Lance, Mallet, Maul, Mattock,\r\nNeedle, Pail, Pott, Potts, Plowe, Plane, Pipes, Pottle, Patten, Posnet,\r\n(a purse or money-bag,) Pitcher, Rule, Rainbow, Sack, Saw, Shovel,\r\nShears, Scales, Silverspoon, Swords, Tankard, Tabor, (a drum,) Trowel,\r\nTubb and Wedge, and a good many others.”[53]\r\n\r\nAnd now, having taken a passing glance at signboard history, from the\r\nearliest times down to the present day, we may not improperly conclude\r\nthis chapter with an enumeration of the inn, tavern, and public-house\r\nsigns which occur most frequently in London, in this present year of\r\ngrace, 1864:--\r\n\r\n12 Adam and Eves, 13 Albions, 5 Alfred’s Heads, 13 Anchor and Hopes, 18\r\nAngels, 8 Angels and Crowns, 3 Antigallicans, 5 Artichokes, 13 Barley\r\nMows, 9 Beehives, 31 Bells, 7 Ben Jonsons, 5 Birds in Hand, 5 Black\r\nBoys, 16 Black Bulls, 5 Black Dogs, 29 Black Horses, 10 Black Lions, 6\r\nBlack Swans, 19 Blue Anchors, 5 Blue Coat Boys, 6 Blue Lasts, 14 Blue\r\nPeters, 27 Bricklayers’ Arms, 5 Bridge Houses, 22 Britannias, 15 Brown\r\nBears, 8 Builders’ Arms, 17 Bulls, (some combined with Bells, Butchers,\r\n&c.,) 22 Bull’s Heads, 4 Camden Heads, 6 Capes of Good Hope, 14\r\nCarpenters’ Arms, 19 Castles, 6 Catherine Wheels, 7 Champions, 5\r\nChequers, 5 Cherry-trees, 8 Cheshire Cheeses, 11 City Arms, 18 Cities of\r\nLondon, and other cities, (as Canton, Paris, Quebec, &c.,) 52 Coach and\r\nHorses, 12 Cocks, 16 Cocks in combination with Bottles, Hoops, Lions,\r\nMagpies, &c., 6 Constitutions, 17 Coopers’ Arms, 7 Crooked Billets, 5\r\nCross Keys, 61 Crowns, 18 Crown and Anchors, 5 Crown and Cushions, 11\r\nCrown and Sceptres, 17 Crowns, combined with other objects, as Anvils,\r\nBarley Mows, Thistles, Dolphins, &c., (in all, 112 Crowns;

Everybody\r\nbegan to laugh.”\r\n\r\n[8] Hist. Nat., xxxv. ch. 8: “After this I find that they were also\r\ncommonly placed on the Forum. Hence that joke of Crassus, the orator.\r\n. . . On the Forum was also that of an old shepherd with a staff,\r\nconcerning which a German legate, being asked at how much he valued it,\r\nanswered that he would not care to have such a man given to him as a\r\npresent, even if he were real and alive.”\r\n\r\n[9] “There were, namely, taverns round about the Forum, and that picture\r\n[the Cock] had been put up as a sign.”\r\n\r\n[10] The Bush certainly must be counted amongst the most ancient and\r\npopular of signs. Traces of its use are not only found among Roman and\r\nother old-world remains, but during the Middle Ages we have evidence of\r\nits display. Indications of it are to be seen in the Bayeux tapestry, in\r\nthat part where a house is set on fire, with the inscription, _Hic domus\r\nincenditur_, next to which appears a large building, from which projects\r\nsomething very like a pole and a bush, both at the front and the back of\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\n[11] In Cædmon’s Metrical Paraphrase of Scripture History, (_circa_ A.D.\r\n1000,) in the drawings relating to the history of Abraham, there are\r\ndistinctly represented certain cruciform ornaments painted on the walls,\r\nwhich might serve the purpose of signs. (_See_ upon this subject under\r\n“RELIGIOUS SIGNS.”)\r\n\r\n[12] The palace of St Laurence Poulteney, the town residence of Charles\r\nBrandon, Duke of Suffolk, and also of the Dukes of Buckingham, was\r\ncalled the Rose, from that badge being hung up in front of the house:--\r\n\r\n  “The Duke being at the Rose, within the parish\r\n  Of St Laurence Poultney.”--_Henry VIII._, a. i. s. 2.\r\n\r\n“A house in the town of Lewes was formerly known as THE THREE PELICANS,\r\nthe fact of those birds constituting the arms of Pelham having been lost\r\nsight of.

To\r\nAldus’s Institutiones Grammaticæ, printed in their offices, they have\r\naffixed our well-known sign of the Dolphin wound round the Anchor. But\r\nthey have so managed, that any person who is in the least acquainted\r\nwith the books of our production, cannot fail to observe that this is an\r\nimpudent fraud. For the head of the Dolphin is turned to the left,\r\nwhereas that of ours is well known to be turned to the right.”--_Preface\r\nto Aldus’s Livy_, 1518.\r\n\r\n[17] The number of taverns in these ten shires was “686, or\r\nthereabouts.”\r\n\r\n[18] “The original court roll of this presentation is still to be found\r\namongst the records of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.”--LYSON’S\r\n_Env. of London_, vol. iii. p. 74.\r\n\r\n[19] “Whosoever shall brew ale in the town of Cambridge, with intention\r\nof selling it, must hang out a sign, otherwise he shall forfeit his\r\nale.”\r\n\r\n[20] “Art.

Thus it is\r\nthat even the Duke of Wellington is now neglected, and in his place we\r\nsee General Havelock, Sir Colin Campbell, Lord Palmerston, and Mr\r\nGladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, not omitting the fair\r\nPrincess of Denmark. We will not now dwell upon these modern\r\ncelebrities, but rather direct our attention to those illustrious dead\r\nupon whom the signboard honours were bestowed in bygone ages.\r\n\r\nMany signboards have an historic connexion of some sort with the place\r\nwhere they are exhibited. Thus the ALFRED’S HEAD, at Wantage, in\r\nBerkshire, was in all probability chosen as a sign because Wantage was\r\nthe birthplace of King Alfred. So the CANUTE CASTLE, at Southampton,\r\nowes its existence to a local tradition; whilst admiration for the great\r\nScotch patriot made an innkeeper in Stowell Street, Newcastle, adopt SIR\r\nWILLIAM WALLACE’S ARMS. The CÆSAR’S HEAD was, in 1761, to be seen near\r\nthe New Church in the Strand,[54] and, in the beginning of this century,\r\nwas the sign of a tavern in Soho, which afterwards removed to Great\r\nPalace Yard, Westminster. Even at the present day, his head may be seen\r\noutside certain village alehouses; but this we may attribute to that\r\nprovincial popularity which the Roman hero shares with Oliver Cromwell;\r\nfor as the Protector gets the blame of having made nearly all the ruins\r\nwhich are to be found in the three kingdoms, so Cæsar is generally named\r\nby country people as the builder of every old wall or earthwork the\r\norigin of which is unknown.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the popular censure, CROMWELL is still honoured with\r\nsignboards in places where his memory has lingered, as at Kate’s Hill,\r\nnear Dudley.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, however, signboard popularity is rather short-lived;\r\n“_dulcique animos novitate tenebo_” seems to be essentially the motto of\r\nthose that choose popular characters for their sign. Had this modern\r\ntribute of admiration been in use at the time of the Preacher, it might\r\nhave afforded him one more illustration of the vanity of vanities to be\r\nfound in all sublunary things. Horace Walpole noticed this fickleness of\r\nsignboard fame in one of his letters:--\r\n\r\n  “I was yesterday out of town, and the very signs, as I passed through\r\n  the villages, made me make very quaint reflections on the mortality of\r\n  fame and popularity. I observed how the Duke’s Head had succeeded\r\n  almost universally to Admiral Vernon’s, as his had left but few traces\r\n  of the Duke of Ormond’s. I pondered these things in my breast, and\r\n  said to myself, ’Surely all glory is but as a sign!’”[55]\r\n\r\nSome favourites of the signboard have, however, been more fortunate than\r\nothers. HENRY VIII., for instance, may still be seen in many places;\r\nindeed, for more than two centuries after his death, almost every KING’S\r\nHEAD invariably gave a portrait of Bluff Harry.\r\n\r\nOlder kings occasionally occur, but their memories seem to have been\r\nrevived rather than handed down by successive innkeepers. If we are to\r\nbelieve an old Chester legend, however, THE KING EDGAR INN, in Bridge\r\nStreet of that city, has existed by the same name since the time of the\r\nSaxon king. The sign represents King Edgar rowed down the river Dee by\r\nthe eight tributary kings. The present house has the appearance of being\r\nbuilt anterior to the reign of Elizabeth, and the sign looks almost as\r\nold, but it would be unwise to give the place or the sign a much higher\r\nantiquity. KING JOHN is the sign under whose auspices Jem Mace, the\r\npugilist, keeps a public-house in Holywell Lane, Shoreditch. The same\r\nking also figures in Albemarle Street and in Bermondsey; whilst the\r\ngreat event of his reign, MAGNA CHARTA, is a sign at New Holland, Hull.\r\nJOHN OF GAUNT may be seen in many places; and we may surmise that his\r\nupholders are stanch Protestants, who value his character as a reformer\r\nand supporter of Wicliffe. The BLACK PRINCE may not unlikely have come\r\ndown to us in an uninterrupted line of signboards; so little was his\r\nidentity sometimes understood, that there is a shop-bill in the “Banks\r\nCollection”[56] on which this hero is represented as a negro!\r\n\r\nThere is a QUEEN ELEANOR in London Fields, Hackney, probably the\r\nbeautiful and affectionate queen of Edward I., buried in Westminster\r\nAbbey, 1290, in honour of whom Charing Cross, Cheapcross, and seven\r\nother crosses, were erected on the places where her body rested on its\r\nway to the great Abbey. What prompted the choice of this sign it is hard\r\nto say.\r\n\r\nAt Hever, in Kent, a rude portrait of Henry VIII. may be seen. Near this\r\nvillage the Bolleyn or Bullen family formerly held large possessions;\r\nand old people in the district yet shew the spot where, as the story\r\ngoes, King Henry often used to meet Sir Thomas Bolleyn’s daughter Anne.\r\nBe this as it may, years after the unhappy death of Anne, the village\r\nalehouse had for its sign, BULLEN BUTCHERED; but the place falling into\r\nnew hands, the name of the house was altered to the BULL AND BUTCHER,\r\nwhich sign existed to a recent date, and would probably have swung at\r\nthis moment, but for a desire of the resident clergyman to see something\r\ndifferent. He suggested the KING’S HEAD; and the village painter was\r\nforthwith commissioned to make the alteration. The latter accepted the\r\ntask, drew the bluff features of the monarch, and represented it as\r\nother King’s Heads, but in his hands placed a large axe, which signboard\r\nexists to this day.\r\n\r\nAs for QUEEN ELIZABETH, she was the constant type of the Queen’s Head,\r\nas her father was of the King’s Head; and, like him, she may still be\r\nseen in many places. It is somewhat more difficult to ascertain who is\r\nmeant by the QUEEN CATHERINE in Brook Street, Ratcliffe Highway; whether\r\nit be Queen Catherine of Aragon, or Queen Catherine of Braganza. QUEEN\r\nANNE, in South Street, Walworth, has evidently come down to us as the\r\ntoken of that house since the day of its opening, just as the QUEEN OF\r\nBOHEMIA, who, until about fifty years ago, continued as a sign in Drury\r\nLane.[57] This was Elizabeth, daughter of James I., married to Frederic\r\nV., Elector-Palatine, who, after her husband’s death, lived at Craven\r\nHouse, Drury Lane, and died there, February 13, 1661, having been\r\nprivately married, it is thought, to Lord Craven, who was foremost in\r\nfighting the battles of her husband.\r\n\r\nOf KING’S HEADS, Henry VIII. is the oldest on authentic record. But\r\nthis does not prove that he was the first; for, as there lived great men\r\nbefore Agamemnon, so most kings during their reign will, in all\r\nprobability, have had their signs. Among Henry’s successors, we find the\r\nhead of Edward VI. on a trades token; whilst CHARLES THE FIRST’S HEAD\r\nwas the portrait hanging from the house of that scoundrel Jonathan Wild,\r\nin the Old Bailey. Even at the present day there is a sign of CHARLES\r\nTHE FIRST at Goring Heath, Reading. The MARTYR’S HEAD in Smithfield,\r\n1710, seems also to have been a portrait of Charles I.; so, at least,\r\nthe following allusion gives us to understand:--\r\n\r\n  “May Hyde, near Smithfield, at the Martyr’s Head,\r\n  Who charms the nicest judge with noble red,\r\n  Thrive on by drawing wines, which none can blame,\r\n  But those who in his sign behold their shame;”[58]\r\n\r\nwhich seems to be an allusion to Puritanical water-drinkers. To this\r\nunfortunate king belongs also the sign of the MOURNING BUSH, set up by\r\nTaylor the water-poet over his tavern in Phœnix Alley, Long Acre, to\r\nexpress his grief at the beheading of Charles I.; but he was soon\r\ncompelled to take it down, when he put up the POET’S HEAD, his own\r\nportrait, with this inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “There is many a head hangs for a sign;\r\n  Then, gentle reader, why not mine?”\r\n\r\nThis “Poeta Aquaticus,” as he sometimes called himself, was a boatman on\r\nthe Thames, and alehouse-keeper by profession, besides being the author\r\nof fourscore books of very original poetry. At the same time that he put\r\nup his new sign of the Poet’s Head, he issued a rhyming pamphlet, in\r\nwhich occur the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “My signe was once a _Crowne_, but now it is\r\n  Changed by a sudden metamorphosis.\r\n  The crowne was taken downe, and in the stead\r\n  Is placed John Taylor’s, or the _Poet’s Head_.\r\n  A painter did my picture gratis make,\r\n  And (for a signe) I hang’d it for his sake.\r\n  Now, if my picture’s drawing can prevayle,\r\n  ’Twill draw my friends to me, and I’ll draw ale.\r\n  Two strings are better to a bow than one;\r\n  And poeting does me small good alone.\r\n  So ale alone yields but small good to me,\r\n  Except it have some spice of poesie.\r\n  The fruits of ale are unto drunkards such,\r\n  To make ‘em sweare and lye that drinke too much.\r\n  But my ale, being drunk with moderation,\r\n  Will quench thirst, and make merry recreation.\r\n  My book and signe were publish’d for two ends,\r\n  T’ invite my honest, civill, sober friends.\r\n  From such as are not such, I kindly pray,\r\n  Till I send for ‘em, let ‘em keep away.\r\n  From _Phœnix Alley_, the _Globe Taverne_ neare,\r\n  The _middle of Long Acre_, I _dwell_ there.\r\n\r\n  “JOHN TAYLOR, _Poeta Aquaticus_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nEAGLE AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Bills, circa 1750.)\r\n\r\nROBIN HOOD AND LITTLE JOHN.\r\n\r\n(Roxburghe Ballads, 1600.)\r\n\r\nGRIFFIN AND CHAIR.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Bills, 1790.)\r\n\r\nBOLT-IN-TUN.\r\n\r\n(Fleet Street).\r\n\r\nBOAR’S HEAD.\r\n\r\n(Eastcheap.)\r\n\r\nBULL’S HEAD.\r\n\r\n(Longhborough, Linc., 1806.)]\r\n\r\nThe MOURNING CROWN was afterwards revived, and in the last century it\r\nwas the sign of a tavern in Aldersgate, where, on Saturdays, when\r\nParliament was not sitting, the Duke of Devonshire, the Earls of Oxford,\r\nSunderland, Pembroke, and Winchelsea, Mr Bagford the antiquary, and\r\nBritton the musical small-coalman, used to refresh themselves, after\r\nhaving passed the forepart of the day in hunting for antiquities and\r\ncuriosities in Little Britain and its neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nNot only was the Crown put in mourning at the death of Charles I., but\r\nalso the MITRE. Hearne has an anecdote which he transcribed from Dr\r\nRichard Rawlinson:--“Of Daniel Rawlinson, who kept the Mitre Tavern in\r\nFenchurch Street, and of whose being sequestered in the Rump time, I\r\nhave heard much. The Whigs tell this, that upon the king’s murder he\r\nhung his sign in mourning. He certainly judged right; the honour of the\r\nmitre was much eclipsed through the loss of so good a parent of the\r\nChurch of England. Those rogues say, this endeared him so much to the\r\nChurchmen that he soon throve amain, and got a good estate.”\r\n\r\nCHARLES THE SECOND’S HEAD swung at the door of a “music-house” for\r\nseafaring men and others, in Stepney, at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. In a great room of this house there was an organ and a band of\r\nfiddles and hautboys, to the music whereof it was no unusual thing for\r\nparties, and sometimes single persons,--and those not of very inferior\r\nsort,--to dance. At the present day, that king’s memory is still kept\r\nalive on a signboard in Herbert Street, Hoxton, under the name of the\r\nMERRY MONARCH.\r\n\r\nTo his miraculous escape at Boscobel we owe the ROYAL OAK, which,\r\nnotwithstanding a lapse of two centuries and a change of dynasty, still\r\ncontinues a very favourite sign. In London alone it occurs on twenty-six\r\npublic-houses, exclusive of beerhouses, coffee-houses, &c. Sometimes it\r\nis called KING CHARLES IN THE OAK, as at Willen Hall, Warwickshire. The\r\nRoyal Oak, soon after the Restoration, became a favourite with the shops\r\nof London; tokens of some half a dozen houses bearing that sign are\r\nextant. What is rather curious is that, not many years since, one of the\r\ndescendants of trusty Dick Pendrell kept an inn at Lewes, in Sussex,\r\ncalled the Royal Oak.\r\n\r\nThere is a trades token of “William Hagley, at the RESTORATION, in St\r\nGeorge’s Fields;” but how this event was represented does not appear. At\r\nCharing Cross it was commemorated by the sign of the PAGEANT Tavern,\r\nwhich represented the triumphal arch erected at that place on occasion\r\nof the entry of Charles II., and which remained standing for a year\r\nafter. This was evidently the same house which Pepys calls the TRIUMPH.\r\nIt seems to have been a fashionable place, for he went there, on the\r\n25th May 1662, to see the Portuguese ladies of Queen Catherine. “They\r\nare not handsome,” says he, “and their fardingales a strange dress. Many\r\nladies and persons of quality come to see them. I find nothing in them\r\nthat is pleasing; and I see they have learned to kiss and look freely up\r\nand down already, and, I believe, will soon forget the recluse practice\r\nof their own country. They complain much for lack of good water to\r\ndrink.” The Triumph is still the sign of a public-house in Skinner\r\nStreet, Somers Town.\r\n\r\nQUEEN MARY was in her day a very popular sign, as may be gathered from\r\nmany of the shop-bills in the Banks Collection; whilst WILLIAM AND MARY\r\nare still to be seen in Maiden Causeway, Cambridge. The accession of the\r\nhouse of Brunswick produced the BRUNSWICK, still very common,\r\nparticularly in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Then come the Georges, of\r\nwhom GEORGE III. and GEORGE IV. still survive in nearly as many\r\ninstances as their successor, WILLIAM IV.; with them a few of the royal\r\nDukes of CLARENCE, SUFFOLK, and, above all, “the Butcher CUMBERLAND;”\r\nuntil at length we come to PRINCESS VICTORIA, and, finally, the QUEEN\r\nVICTORIA, the BRITISH QUEEN, ISLAND QUEEN, &c. Under one of her signs at\r\nCoopersale, in Essex, is the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n      “The Queen some day\r\n      May pass this way,\r\n  And see our Tom and Jerry.\r\n      Perhaps she’ll stop,\r\n      And stand a drop,\r\n  To make her subjects merry.”\r\n\r\nAmong the foreign kings and potentates who have figured in our open-air\r\nwalhalla, the Turkish sultans seem to have stood foremost. MORAT\r\n(Amurat) and SOLIMAN were constant coffee-house signs in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Trades tokens are extant, in the Beaufoy and other collections,\r\nof a coffee-house in Exchange Alley, the sign of Morat, with this\r\ndistich:--\r\n\r\n  “MORAT . Y^{E} . GREAT . MEN . DID . MEE . CALL\r\n  WHERE . ERE . I . CAME . I . CONQUER’D . ALL.”\r\n\r\nOn the reverse: “_Coffee, tobacco, sherbett, tea, and chocolat retal’d\r\nin Exchange Alley._” The same house figures in advertisements of the\r\ntime, giving the prices of those various articles:--\r\n\r\n  “AT THE COFFEE-HOUSE in Exchange Alley is sold by Retail the right\r\n  Coffee-powder, from 4s. to 6s. _per pound_, as in goodness: that\r\n  pounded in a mortar at 3s. _per pound_; also that termed the right\r\n  Turkie Berry, well garbled, at 3s. _per pound_--the ungarbled for\r\n  less; that termed the East India Berry at 20d. _per pound_, with\r\n  directions gratis how to make and use the same. Likewise, there you\r\n  may have Tobacco, Verinas and Virginia, Chocolatta--the ordinary\r\n  pound-boxes at 2s. _per pound_; also Sherbets (made in Turkie) of\r\n  Lemons, Roses, and Violets perfumed; and Tea according to its\r\n  goodness, from 6s. to 60s. _per pound_. For all of which, if any\r\n  Gentleman shall write or send, they shall be sure of the best as they\r\n  shall order; and to avoid deceit, warranted under the House\r\n  Seal--viz., MORAT THE GREAT,” &c.--_Mercurius Publicus_, March 12-19,\r\n  1662.\r\n\r\nThe GREAT MOGOL also had his share of signboards, of which a few still\r\nsurvive; one, for instance, in New Bartholomew Street, Birmingham. KOULI\r\nKHAN we find only in one instance, (though there were probably many\r\nmore,) namely, on the sign of a tavern by the Quayside, Newcastle, in\r\n1746.[59] This house had formerly been called the Crown, but changed its\r\nsign in honour of Thomas Nadir Shah, or Kouli Khan, who, from having\r\nbeen chief of a band of robbers, at last sat himself on the throne of\r\nPersia. He was killed in 1747. One of the reasons of his popularity in\r\nthis country was the permission he granted to the English nation to\r\ntrade with Persia, the most chimerical ideas being entertained of the\r\nadvantages to be derived from that commerce. Hanway, the philanthropist,\r\nwas for some time concerned in it, but died before he could carry out\r\nthe scheme; ultimately, the death of Nadir Shah himself put an end to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe INDIAN KING, which we meet with so frequently, is an extremely vague\r\npersonage, which various Indian potentates might take for themselves as\r\nthe cap fitted. It was generally set up when some king from the far East\r\nvisited the metropolis, and for a short time created a sensation. Thus,\r\nin 1710, there were four Indian kings from “states between New England,\r\nNew York and Canada,” who had audiences with Queen Anne, and seems to\r\nhave been a good deal talked about. (_See Spectator_, No. 50.)\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1762, London was honoured with the visit of a Cherokee king,\r\nand thus many before and after him have created their nine days’ wonder.\r\n\r\nVisits of European monarchs were also commemorated by complimentary\r\nsigns. One of the oldest was the KING OF DENMARK, and few kings better\r\nthan he deserved the exalted place at the alehouse door; yet, such is\r\nthe ingratitude of the world, that he seems now completely forgotten.\r\nThe sign originated in the reign of James I., who married a daughter of\r\nChristian IV., King of Denmark. In July 1606, the royal father-in-law\r\ncame over on a visit, when the two kings began “bousing” and carousing\r\nright royally, the court, of course, duly following the example. “I came\r\nhere a day or two before the Danish king came,” says Sir John\r\nHarrington, “and from that day he did come till this hour, I have been\r\nwell-nigh overwhelmed with carousal and sport of all kinds. I think the\r\nDane has strangely wrought on our English nobles; for those whom I could\r\nnever get to taste good liquor, now follow the fashion and wallow in\r\nbeastly delights. The ladies abandon their society, and are seen to roll\r\nabout in intoxication,” &c.[60] So late as thirty years ago, not less\r\nthan three of these signs were left, the most notorious being in the Old\r\nBailey. It used to be open all night for the sale of creature comforts\r\nto the drunkard, the thief, the nightwalker, and profligates of every\r\ndescription. Slang was the language of the place, and doubtless the\r\nrefreshments were mostly paid for with stolen money. On execution\r\nnights, the landlord used to reap a golden harvest; then there were such\r\nscenes of drunkenness as must have done the old king on the signboard\r\ngood to survey, and made him wish to be inside. The visit of another\r\ncrowned votary of Bacchus is commemorated by the sign of the CZAR’S\r\nHEAD, Great Tower Street:--\r\n\r\n  “Peter the Great and his companions, having finished their day’s work,\r\n  used to resort to a public-house in Great Tower Street, close to Tower\r\n  Hill, to smoke their pipes and drink beer and brandy. The landlord had\r\n  the Czar of Muscovy’s Head painted, and put it up for his sign, which\r\n  continued till the year 1808, when a person of the name of Waxel took\r\n  a fancy to the old sign, and offered the then occupier of the house to\r\n  paint him a new one for it. A copy was accordingly made of the\r\n  original, which maintains its station to the present day as the Czar\r\n  of Muscovy.”[61]\r\n\r\nThe sign is now removed, but the public-house still bears the same name.\r\nPRINCE EUGENE also was at one time a popular tavern portrait in England,\r\nmore particularly after his visit to this country in January 1712. It is\r\nnamed as one of the signs in Norwich in 1750,[62] but is now, we\r\nbelieve, completely extinct in England; in Paris there is still one\r\nsurviving on the Boulevard St Martin.\r\n\r\nThe GRAVE MAURICE is of very old standing in London, being named by\r\nTaylor the water-poet as an inn at Knightsbridge in 1636; at present\r\nthere are two left, one in Whitechapel Road, the other in St Leonard’s\r\nRoad. Who this Grave Maurice was is not quite clear. GRAVE (_Ger._ Graf,\r\n_Dutch_ Graaf, _i.e._ COUNT,) Maurice of Nassau, afterwards Maurice,\r\nPrince of Orange, was, on account of his successful opposition to the\r\nSpanish domination in the Netherlands, very popular in this country. In\r\nBaker’s Chronicles, anno 1612, we read that:--“Upon St Thomas-day, the\r\nPaltzgrave and _Grave Maurice_ were elected Knights of the Garter; and\r\nthe 27th of December, the Paltzgrave was betrothed to the Lady\r\nElizabeth. On Sunday the 7th of February, the Paltzgrave in person was\r\ninstalled a Knight of the Garter at Windsor, and at the same time was\r\n_Grave Maurice_ installed by his deputy, Count Lodewick of Nassau.” The\r\nGarter conferred on the Grave Maurice was that which had been previously\r\nworn by _Henri Quatre_, King of France and Navarre. The Palzgrave was\r\nGrave Maurice’s nephew, the Palatine Count Frederick, by whose marriage\r\nwith King James’s daughter were born the brothers Rupert and Maurice,\r\n(the latter in 1620,) who distinguished themselves in England during the\r\ncivil wars. It was this Prince Maurice’s great uncle, the Grave Maurice\r\nof Nassau, whose counterfeit presentment still gives a name to two of\r\nour taverns. Another Maurice, about this period, was very popular in\r\nEngland--viz., Maurice Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, who “carried away the\r\npalm of excellency in whatever is to be wished in a brave prince.”[63]\r\nPeacham, enumerating this prince’s qualifications, says that he was a\r\ngood musician, spoke ten or twelve languages, was a universal scholar,\r\ncould dispute, “even in boots and spurs,” for an hour with the best\r\nprofessors on any subject, and was the best bone-setter in the country.\r\nHe gained, too, much of his popularity by his adherence to the\r\nProtestant religion during the Thirty Years’ War.\r\n\r\nThe PALTSGRAVE became a popular sign at the marriage of Frederick\r\nCasimir V., Elector and Count Palatine of the Rhine, King of Bohemia,\r\nwith Elizabeth, daughter of James I. Trades tokens are extant of a\r\nfamous tavern, the sign of the PALSGRAVE’S HEAD, without Temple Bar,[64]\r\nwhich gave its name to Paltsgrave Court, whilst the PALATINE HEAD was an\r\ninn near the French ‘Change, Soho. PRINCE RUPERT, the Palsgrave’s son,\r\nwho behaved so gallantly in many of the fights during the Civil War, was\r\nno doubt a favourite sign after the Restoration. We have an instance of\r\none on the trades token of Jacob Robins, in the Strand.\r\n\r\nOne of the last foreign princes to whom the signboard honour was\r\naccorded, was the KING OF PRUSSIA. This still occurs in many places.\r\nAfter the battle of Rosbach, Frederick the Great, our ally, became the\r\npopular hero in England. Ballads were made, in which he was called\r\n“Frederick of Prussia, or the Hero.” “Portraits of the hero of Rosbach,\r\nwith his cocked hat and long pigtail, were in every house. An attentive\r\nobserver will at this day find in the parlours of old-fashioned inns,\r\nand in the portfolios of printsellers, twenty portraits of Frederick for\r\none of George II. The sign-painters were everywhere employed in touching\r\nup ADMIRAL VERNON into the KING OF PRUSSIA.[65]”\r\n\r\nThese words of Macaulay remind us of a passage in the _Mirror_, No. 82,\r\nSaturday, February 19, 1780, bearing on the same subject. In 1739, after\r\nthe capture of Portobello, Admiral Vernon’s “portrait dangled from every\r\nsignpost, and he may be figuratively said to have sold the ale, beer,\r\nporter, and purl of England for six years. Towards the close of that\r\nperiod, the admiral’s favour began to fade apace with the colours of his\r\nuniform, and the battle of Culloden was total annihilation for him.\r\n. . . The DUKE OF CUMBERLAND kept possession of the signboard a long\r\ntime. In the beginning of the last war, our admirals in the\r\nMediterranean, and our generals in North America, did nothing that could\r\ntend in the least degree to move his Royal Highness from his place; but\r\nthe doubtful battle of Hamellan, followed by the unfortunate convention\r\nof Stade, and the rising fame of the King of Prussia, obliterated the\r\nglories of the Duke of Cumberland as effectually as his Royal Highness\r\nand the battle of Culloden had effaced the figure, the memory, and the\r\nrenown of Admiral Vernon. The duke was so completely displaced by his\r\nPrussian majesty, that we have some doubts whether he met with fair\r\nplay. One circumstance, indeed, was much against him; his figure being\r\nmarked by a hat with the Kevenhuller cock, a military uniform, and a\r\nvery fierce look, a slight touch of the painter converted him into the\r\nKing of Prussia. But what crowned the success of his Prussian majesty,\r\nwas the title bestowed upon him by the brothers of the brush, ‘The\r\nGlorious Protestant Hero,’ words which added splendour to every\r\nsignpost, and which no British hero could read without peculiar\r\nsensation of veneration and of thirst.\r\n\r\n“For two years, ‘the glorious Protestant hero’ was unrivalled; but the\r\nFrench being defeated at Minden, upon the 1st of August 1759, by the\r\narmy under Prince Frederick of Brunswick, the King of Prussia began to\r\ngive place a little to two popular favourites, who started at the same\r\ntime; I mean PRINCE FERDINAND, and the MARQUIS OF GRANBY. Prince\r\nFerdinand was supported altogether by his good conduct at Minden, and by\r\nhis high reputation over Europe as a general. The _Marquis of Granby_\r\nbehaved with spirit and personal courage everywhere; but his success on\r\nthe signposts of England was very much owing to a comparison generally\r\nmade between him and another British general of higher rank, but who was\r\nsupposed not to have behaved so well. Perhaps, too, he was a good deal\r\nindebted to another circumstance--to wit, the baldness of his head.”\r\n\r\nThat crowned heads, as well as other human beings, were subject to the\r\nlaw of change on the signboard, is amusingly illustrated in an anecdote\r\ntold by Goldsmith:--\r\n\r\n  “An alehouse keeper near Islington, who had long lived at the sign of\r\n  the French King, upon the commencement of the last war, pulled down\r\n  his old sign, and put up that of the QUEEN OF HUNGARY. Under the\r\n  influence of her red nose and golden sceptre, he continued to sell\r\n  ale, till she was no longer the favourite of his customers; he changed\r\n  her therefore, some time ago, for the King of Prussia who may probably\r\n  be changed in turn for the next great man that shall be set up for\r\n  vulgar admiration.”[66]\r\n\r\nOf all great men, “bene meriti de patria,” military men appear at all\r\ntimes to have captivated the popular favour much more than those men who\r\npromoted the welfare of the country in the Cabinet, or who made\r\nthemselves famous by the arts of peace, and the more quiet productions\r\nof their genius. We find hundreds of admirals and generals on the\r\nsignboard, but we are not aware that there is one Watt, or one Sir\r\nWalter Scott; yet, what glory and pleasure has the nation not derived\r\nfrom their genius! Booksellers formerly honoured the heads and names of\r\ngreat authors with a signboard; but that custom fell into disuse when\r\nsigns became unnecessary. At present, the publicans only have signs, and\r\nthey and their customers can much better appreciate “the glorious pomp\r\nand pageantry of war,” than a parliamentary debate. A victory, with so\r\nmany of the enemy killed and wounded, and so many colours and stands of\r\narms captured, awakens much more thrilling emotions in their breasts\r\nthan the most useful invention, or the most glorious work of art.\r\n\r\nThe sea being our proper element, admirals have always had the lion’s\r\nshare of the popular admiration, and their fame appears more firmly\r\nrooted than that of generals. Signs of ADMIRAL DRAKE, SIR FRANCIS DRAKE,\r\nor the DRAKE ARMS, so common at the water-side in our seaports, shew\r\nthat the nation has not yet forgotten the bold navigator of good _Queen\r\nBess_. SIR WALTER RALEIGH has not been quite so fortunate; for though he\r\nalso came in for a great share of signboard honour, yet it was less\r\nowing to his qualities as a commander, than to his reputation of having\r\nintroduced tobacco into England, whence he became a favourite\r\ntobacconist’s sign; and in that quality, we find him on several of the\r\nshop-bills in the Banks Collection. Signs being frequently used in the\r\nlast century for political pasquinades, advantage was taken of a\r\ntobacconist’s sign for the following sharp hit at Lord North:--\r\n\r\n  “To the Printer of the _General Advertiser_:--\r\n\r\n  “SIR,--Being a smoaker, I take particular notice of the devices used\r\n  by different dealers in tobacco, by way of ornament to the papers in\r\n  which that valuable plant is enclosed for sale; and that used by the\r\n  worthy Alderman in Ludgate Street, has often given me much pleasure,\r\n  it having the head of Sir Walter Raleigh, and the following motto\r\n  round it:--\r\n\r\n  ‘Great Britain to great Raleigh owes\r\n  This plant and country where it grows.’\r\n\r\n  “To which I offer the following lines by way of contrast; the truth\r\n  thereof no one can doubt:--\r\n\r\n  ‘To Rubicon and North, old England owes\r\n  The loss of country where tobacco grows.’\r\n\r\n  “I suppose no dealer will chuse to adopt so unfortunate a subject for\r\n  their insignia; but perhaps, when you have a spare corner in your\r\n  _General Advertiser_, it may not be inadmissible, which will\r\n  oblige.--Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n  “A SMOAKER.\r\n\r\n  “Feb. 1, 1783.\r\n\r\n  _General Advertiser_, March 13, 1784.”\r\n\r\nBrave old ADMIRAL BENBOW, who held up the honour of the British flag in\r\nthe reign of William III., is still far from uncommon. ADMIRAL DUNCAN,\r\nHOWE, and JERVIS still preside over the sale of many a hogshead of beer\r\nor spirits; whilst ADMIRAL VERNON seems to have secured himself an\r\neverlasting place on the front of the alehouse, by reason of his dashing\r\ncapture of PORTOBELLO; the name of that town, or sometimes the\r\nPORTOBELLO ARMS, being also frequently adopted, instead of the admiral’s\r\nname. ADMIRAL KEPPEL is another great favourite. There is a public-house\r\nwith that sign, on the Fulham Road, where, some years ago, the portrait\r\nof the admiral used to court the custom of the passing traveller, by a\r\npoetical appeal to both man and beast:--\r\n\r\n  “Stop, brave boys, and quench your thirst;\r\n  If you won’t drink, your horses murst.”\r\n\r\nBut, above all, ADMIRAL RODNEY seems to have obtained a larger share of\r\npopularity than even NELSON himself. In Boston there is the RODNEY AND\r\nHOOD; and in Creggin, Montgomeryshire, the RODNEY PILLAR Inn, with the\r\nfollowing Anacreontic effusion on a double-sided signboard:--\r\n\r\n  “Under these trees, in sunny weather,\r\n  Just try a cup of ale, however;\r\n  And if in tempest or in storm,\r\n  A couple then to make you warm;\r\n  But when the day is very cold,\r\n  Then taste a mug a twelvemonth old.”\r\n\r\nOn the reverse:--\r\n\r\n    “Rest and regal yourself, ’tis pleasant;\r\n      Enough is all the present need,\r\n    That’s the due of the hardy peasant\r\n      Who toils all sorts of men to feed.\r\n  Then muzzle not the ox when he treads out the corn,\r\n  Nor grudge honest labour its pipe and its horn.”\r\n\r\nThe last addition to this portrait gallery, before SIR CHARLES NAPIER,\r\nwas the head of the gallant besieger of Algiers, LORD EXMOUTH. In 1825,\r\nthere was one at Barnstaple, in Devon, with the following address to the\r\nwayfarer:--\r\n\r\n  “All you that pace round field or moor,\r\n  Pray do not pass John Armstrong’s door;\r\n  There’s what will cheer man in his course,\r\n  And entertainment for his horse.”\r\n\r\nFinally, there is still one sign left in honour of that deserving but\r\nunfortunate commander, CAPTAIN COOK, murdered by the natives of Owhyhee\r\nin 1779. His name is preserved as the sign of an alehouse in Mariner\r\nStreet, London.\r\n\r\nThough the fame of generals seems to be more short-lived than that of\r\nadmirals, yet a few ancient heroes still remain. Amongst these, GENERAL\r\nELLIOTT, or LORD HEATHFIELD, the defender of Gibraltar, seems to be one\r\nof the greatest favourites; perhaps his popularity in London was not a\r\nlittle increased by the present which he made to Astley, of his charger\r\nnamed Gibraltar; who, performing every evening in the ring, and shining\r\nforth in the circus bills, would certainly act as an excellent puff for\r\nthe general’s glory. This hero’s popularity is only surpassed by that of\r\nthe MARQUIS OF GRANBY. Though nearly a century has elapsed since the\r\ndeath of the latter, (Oct. 19, 1770,) his portrait is still one of the\r\nmost common signs. In London alone, he presides over eighteen\r\npublic-houses, besides numerous beerhouses. The first one is said to\r\nhave been hung out at Hounslow, by one Sumpter, a discharged trooper of\r\nthe regiment of Horse Guards, which the Marquis of Granby had commanded\r\nas colonel.\r\n\r\nAmong the generals of a later period, are GENERAL TARLETON, (or, as he\r\nis called on a sign in Clarence Street, Newcastle, COLONEL TARLTON,)\r\nGENERAL WOLFE, GENERAL MOORE, and SIR RALPH ABERCROMBIE. At a tavern of\r\nthis last denomination in Lombard Street, some thirty-five or forty\r\nyears ago, the “House of Lords’ Club” used to meet, not composed, as\r\nmight be expected from the name, of members of the peerage, but simply\r\nof the good citizens of the neighbourhood, each dubbed with a title. The\r\npresident was styled Lord Chancellor; he wore a legal wig and robes, and\r\na mace was laid on the table before him. The title bestowed upon the\r\nmembers depended on the fee--one shilling constituted a Baron, two\r\nshillings a Viscount, three shillings an Earl, four shillings a Marquis,\r\nand five shillings a Duke; beyond that rank their ambition did not\r\nreach. This club originated early in the eighteenth century, at the\r\nFLEECE in Cornhill, but removed to the THREE TUNS in Southwark, that the\r\nmembers might be more retired from the bows and compliments of the\r\nLondon apprentices, who used to salute the noble lords by their titles\r\nas they passed to and fro in the streets about their business. One of\r\ntheir last houses was the YORKSHIRE GREY, near Roll’s Buildings. At\r\npresent they are, we believe, extinct. In Newcastle, also, there was a\r\nHouse of Lords, of which Bewick the wood-engraver was a member. They\r\nused to hold their meetings in the Groat Market of that town.\r\n\r\nThe DUKE’S HEAD, and the OLD DUKE, are signs that, for the last two or\r\nthree centuries, have always been applied to some ducal hero or other,\r\nfor the time being basking himself in the noontide sun of fame. One of\r\nthe first to whom it was applied, was Monck, DUKE OF ALBEMARLE after the\r\nRestoration; then came ORMOND, MARLBOROUGH, CUMBERLAND, YORK, and, at\r\npresent, WELLINGTON and the DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE. The DUKE’S HEAD in Upper\r\nStreet, corner of Gad’s Row, Islington, was the sign of a public-house\r\nkept by Thomas Topham, the strong man, who, in 1741, in honour of\r\nAdmiral Vernon’s birthday, lifted three hogsheads of water, weighing\r\n1859 lb., in Coldbath Fields.[67]\r\n\r\nThe DUKE OF ALBEMARLE figured on numberless signboards after the\r\nRestoration; but at the same period, there existed still older signs, on\r\nwhich his grace was simply called Monck; as for instance, that hung out\r\nby “Will. Kidd, suttler to the Guard at St James’s,”[68] which was the\r\nMONCK’S HEAD. Kidd had probably followed the army in many a campaign in\r\nformer years, and was much more accustomed to the name of General Monck\r\nthan that of his Grace the Duke of Albemarle. Of the Duke of Ormond\r\nthere is still one instance remaining in Longstreet, Tetbury,\r\nGloucester, under the name of the ORMOND’S HEAD. A very few Dukes of\r\nMarlborough are also left. In the beginning of the eighteenth century,\r\nthe DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH’S HEAD in Fleet Street, was a tavern used for\r\npurposes very similar to those which we are accustomed now-a-days to\r\nbehold at the St James’ and the Egyptian Halls. Among the Bagford Bills,\r\nand in the newspapers of the time, it is constantly mentioned as the\r\nplace where something wonderful or amusing was to be seen--panoramas,\r\ndioramas, moving pictures, marionnettes, curious pieces of mechanism,\r\n&c., &c.[69]\r\n\r\nThe LORD CRAVEN was once a very popular sign in London. It occurs\r\namongst the trades tokens of Bishopsgate Street Without, and even at\r\npresent there is a CRAVEN HEAD and two CRAVEN ARMS in London. These\r\nsigns were in honour of William Craven, eldest son of Sir William\r\nCraven, knt., (Sheriff of London _temp._ Queen Elizabeth.) This nobleman\r\npassed the greater part of his life abroad, serving the Protestant cause\r\nin Holland and in Germany. During the Civil War, he at various times\r\ngave pecuniary assistance to King Charles II., who at the Restoration\r\ncreated him Viscount Craven of Uffington, &c. He is said to have been\r\nprivately married to Elizabeth, daughter of James I., the Queen of\r\nBohemia. He died, April 19, 1697. Though his public and military career\r\nhad certainly been brilliant, yet he owed his popularity probably more\r\nto his civic virtues, shewn during the plague period, when he and\r\nGeneral Monck were almost the only men of rank that remained in town to\r\nkeep order. He even erected a pesthouse at his own expense in Pesthouse\r\nField, Carnaby Market, (now Marshall Street, Golden Square.) His\r\nassistance during the frequent London fires, also tended to make him a\r\nfavourite with the Londoners.\r\n\r\n  “Lord Craven, in the time of King Charles II., was a constant man at a\r\n  fire; for which purpose he always had a horse ready saddled in his\r\n  stables, and rewarded the first that gave him notice of such an\r\n  accident. It was a good-natured fancy, and he did a good deal of\r\n  service; but in that reign everything was turned to a joke. The king\r\n  being told of a terrible fire that was broke out, asked if Lord Craven\r\n  was there yet. ‘Oh!’ says somebody by, ‘an’t please your majesty, he\r\n  was there before it began, waiting for it, he has had two horses burnt\r\n  under him already.’[70] On such occasions he usually rode a white\r\n  horse, well known to the London mob, which was said to smell the fires\r\n  from afar off.”\r\n\r\nThe EARL OF ESSEX, Elizabeth’s _quondam_ favourite, might have been met\r\nwith on many signs long after the Restoration. There are trades tokens\r\nof a shop or tavern with such a sign on the Bankside, Southwark, and\r\ntokens are extant of two other shops that had the ESSEX ARMS. In the\r\nlast century there was an ESSEX HEAD in Essex Street; in this tavern the\r\nRobin Hood Society, “a club of free and candid inquiry,” used to meet.\r\nIt was originally established in 1613, at the house of Sir Hugh\r\nMiddleton, the projector of the New River for supplying London with\r\nwater. Its first meetings were held at the houses of members, but\r\nafterwards, the numbers increasing, they removed to the above tavern,\r\nand its name was altered into the “Essex Head Society.” In 1747 it\r\nremoved to the Robin Hood in Butcher Row, near Temple Bar. The society\r\nattained a position of so much importance, that a history of its\r\nproceedings was published in 1764, giving an account of the subjects\r\ndebated, and reports of some of the speeches. Seven minutes only were\r\nallowed to each speaker, at the expiration of which the _Baker_, or\r\npresident, summed up. Many a young politician here winged his first\r\nflight.[71]\r\n\r\nIn 1784, the year of his death, Dr Johnson instituted at this house a\r\nclub of twenty-four members, in order to insure himself society for at\r\nleast three days in the week. He composed the regulations himself, and\r\nwrote above them the following motto from Milton:--\r\n\r\n  “To-day deep thoughts with me resolve to drench\r\n  In mirth which after no repenting draws.”\r\n\r\nThe house at that time was kept by Samuel Greaves, an old servant of Mrs\r\nThrale. Each night of non-attendance was visited on the members by a\r\nfine of threepence. Members were to spend at least sixpence, besides a\r\npenny for the waiter. Each member had to preside one evening a month.\r\n\r\nThat the Earl of Essex, who had taken up arms against his queen, should\r\nhave continued more than a century after his death, is easily accounted\r\nfor by the immense popularity he enjoyed, exceeding that of any of his\r\ncotemporaries. More difficult to explain is the presence on English\r\nsignboards of the Dutch ADMIRAL VAN TROMP; yet we find him in Church\r\nStreet, Shoreditch, and in St Helen’s, Lancashire. His countryman,\r\nMynheer van Donck, would certainly make a much more appropriate\r\npublic-house sign.\r\n\r\nNames of battles and glorious _faits d’ armes_ have also been much used\r\nas signs,--thus, GIBRALTAR, PORTOBELLO, the BATTLE OF THE NILE, the\r\nMOUTH OF THE NILE, TRAFALGAR, the BATTLE OF WATERLOO, the BATTLE OF THE\r\nPYRAMIDS, are all more or less common. The BULL AND MOUTH is said to\r\nhave a similar origin, being a corruption of Boulogne Mouth, the entry\r\nto Boulogne Harbour, which grew into a popular sign after the capture of\r\nthat place by Henry VIII. The first house with this sign is said to have\r\nbeen an inn in Aldgate. In less than a century the name was already\r\ncorrupted into the “Bull and Mouth,” and the sign represented by a black\r\nbull and a large mouth. Thus it appears on the trades tokens, and also\r\nin a sculpture in the façade of the Queen’s Hotel, St Martin’s-le-Grand,\r\nformerly the Bull and Mouth Inn. Of the same time also dates the BULL\r\nAND GATE, a corruption of the Boulogne Gates, which Henry VIII. ordered\r\nto be taken away, and transported to Hardes, in Kent, where they still\r\n(?) remain. The Bull and Gate was a noted inn in the seventeenth century\r\nin Holborn, where Fielding makes his hero Tom Jones put up on his\r\narrival in London. It is still in existence under the same name, though\r\nmuch reduced in size. There is another in New Chapel Place, Kentish\r\nTown; and a few imitations of it were carried to distant provincial\r\ntowns by the coaches of old times.\r\n\r\nAnother sign of the same period, although not commemorative of a battle,\r\nwas the GOLDEN FIELD GATE, mentioned by Taylor the water-poet, in 1632,\r\nas the sign of an inn at the upper end of Holborn. It was put up in\r\nhonour of the Champ du Drap d’Or, where Henry VIII. and Francis I.,\r\n\r\n  “Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,\r\n  Met in the vale of Arde.”--_Henry VIII._, a. i. s. 1.\r\n\r\nThe signs of great men who have distinguished themselves in the civil\r\nwalks of life are much more scarce. Archimedes we meet with as an\r\noptician’s sign. He had been adopted by that class of workmen on account\r\nof the burning lenses with which he set the Roman fleet on fire at\r\nSyracuse. Various implements of their trade were added as distinctions\r\nby the several shops who sold spectacles under his auspices, such as\r\nGOLDEN PROSPECTS OF PERSPECTIVES, (_i.e._, spectacles or any other glass\r\nthat assisted the sight,) GLOBES, KING’S ARMS, &c. Among the Bagford\r\nBills there is one of John Marshall, optician on Ludgate Hill, “at the\r\nsign of the OLD ARCHIMEDES AND TWO GOLDEN SPECTACLES,” which represents\r\nArchimedes taking astronomical observations, a huge pair of spectacles\r\nbeing suspended on one side of the sign, and on the other a lantern.[72]\r\nARCHIMEDES AND THREE PAIR OF GOLDEN SPECTACLES was the sign of another\r\noptician in Ludgate Street, 1697, who evidently had adopted Marshall’s\r\nsign with the addition of one pair of spectacles, in the hope of\r\nfilching some of his customers. SIR ISAAC NEWTON was another\r\ntelescope-maker’s sign in Ludgate Street _circa_ 1795.[73] At the\r\npresent day he occurs on a few public-houses; but it is somewhat more\r\ngratifying for our national pride to see a coffee-house in the Rue\r\nArcade, Paris, named after him. LORD BACON’S HEAD was the sign of W.\r\nBickerton, a bookseller, without Temple Bar, in 1735; LOCKE’S HEAD, of\r\nT. Peele, between the Temple Gates, 1718; JAMES FERGUSON figured at the\r\ndoor of an optical instrument maker in New Bond Street in 1780.[74] No\r\ndoubt this optician was a Scotchman, who had given preference to a\r\nnational celebrity. Just so, Andrew Miller, the great publisher and\r\nfriend of Thomson, Hume, Fielding, &c., took the BUCHANAN HEAD for the\r\nsign of his shop in the Strand, opposite St Catherine Street, the house\r\nwhere the famous Jacob Tonson had lived, in whose time it was the\r\nSHAKESPEARE’S HEAD. But Miller preferred his countryman, and put up the\r\nless known head of George Buchanan, (1525-1582.) Buchanan was author of\r\na version of the Psalms, and at various times of his life tutor to Queen\r\nMary Stuart, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of\r\nScotland, Principal of St Leonard’s, preceptor to James I., director of\r\nthe Chancery, Privy Seal, &c.\r\n\r\nCARDINAL WOLSEY occurs in many places, particularly in London, Windsor,\r\nand the neighbourhood of Hampton Court. ANDREW MARVEL is still\r\ncommemorated on a sign in Whitefriargate, Hull, of which town he was a\r\nnative. THOMAS GRESHAM, the founder of the Royal Exchange, was a\r\nfavourite in London after the opening of the first Exchange in 1566; and\r\nSIR HUGH MIDDLETON, the projector of the New River, is duly honoured\r\nwith two or three signs in Islington.\r\n\r\nThere exists a curious alehouse picture, called the THREE JOHNS, in\r\nLittle Park Street, Westminster, and in White Lion Street, Pentonville.\r\nThe same sign, many years ago, might have been seen in Bennett Street,\r\nnear Queen Square, in the former locality. It represented an oblong\r\ntable, with John Wilkes in the middle, the Rev. John Horne Tooke at one\r\nend, and Sir John Glynn (sergeant-at-law) at the other. There is a\r\nmezzotinto print of this picture (or the sign may be from the print)\r\ndrawn and engraved by Richard Houston, 1769. John Wilkes, on whom the\r\npopular gratitude for writing the Earl of Bute out of power conferred\r\nmany a signboard, still survives in a few spots. In a small\r\nStaffordshire town called Leek-with-Lowe, there is a stanch re-publican,\r\nwho to this day keeps the WILKES’-HEAD as his sign, whilst another one\r\noccurs in Bridges Street, St Ives. SIR FRANCIS BURDETT is also far from\r\nforgotten, and may still be seen “hung in effigy” at Castlegate,\r\nBerwick, in Nottingham, and in a few other places.\r\n\r\nIn 1683, we find SIR EDMUNDBURY GODFREY on the picture-board of Langley\r\nCurtis, a bookseller near Fleetbridge. Being the martyr of a party, he\r\nundoubtedly for a while must have been a popular sign. LORD ANGLESEY\r\nwas, in 1679, adopted by an inn in Drury Lane. This, we suppose, was\r\nArthur, second Viscount Valentia, son of Sir Thomas Annesley, (Lord\r\nMountmorris,) and elevated to the British peerage by the title of Earl\r\nof Anglesey in 1661; he died in 1686. One of the acts which probably\r\ncontributed most to his popularity was that he, with the Lord Cavendish,\r\nMr Howard, Dr Tillotson, Dr Burnet, and a few others, appeared to\r\nvindicate Lord Russell in the face of the court, and gave testimony to\r\nthe good life and conversation of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe bulky figure of Paracelsus, or, as he called himself, Philippus\r\nAureolus Theophrastus Paracelsus _Bombastus_ von Hohenheim, used\r\nformerly to be a constant apothecaries’ symbol. From an advertisement in\r\nthe _London Gazette_, July 22-26, 1680, about a stolen horse “with a\r\nsowre head,” we gather that there was at that time a sign of PARACELSUS\r\nin Old Fish Street. Information about the horse with “the sowre head”\r\nwould also be received at a house in Lambeth, with no less a dignitary\r\nfor its sign than the BISHOP OF CANTERBURY, his grace having been thus\r\nhonoured from a neighbourly feeling.\r\n\r\nDoctor Butler, (_ob._ 1617,) physician to James I., and, according to\r\nFuller, “the Æsculapius of that age,” invented a kind of medicated ale,\r\ncalled Dr Butler’s ale, “which, if not now, (1784,) was, a few years\r\nago, sold at certain houses that had the BUTLER’S HEAD for a sign.”[75]\r\nOne of the last remaining Butler’s Heads was in a court leading from\r\nBasinghall into Coleman Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.\r\n\r\nSPINNING SOW.\r\n\r\n(France, 1520.)\r\n\r\nTWO STORKS.\r\n\r\n(Antwerp, 1639.)\r\n\r\nTHE COMPLETE ANGLER.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Bills, 1780.)\r\n\r\nHELP ME THROUGH THIS WORLD.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Bills, 1812.)\r\n\r\nCROOKED BILLET.\r\n\r\n(Harleian Collection, 1710.)]\r\n\r\nThat singularly successful quack, Lilly, though he ought not to be\r\nplaced in such good company as the king’s physician, was also a constant\r\nsign, in the last century, at the door of sham doctors and astrologers.\r\nNot unfrequently they combined the BALLS (a favourite sign of the\r\nquacks) with Lilly’s head, as the BLACK BALL AND LILLYHEAD, the sign of\r\nThomas Saffold, “an approved and licensed physician and student in\r\nastrology: he hath practised astronomy for twenty-four years, and hath\r\nhad the Bishop of London’s licence to practise physick ever since the\r\n4th day of September 1674, and hath, he thanks God for it, great\r\nexperience and wonderful success in those arts.” He promised to perform\r\nthe usual _tours de force_.\r\n\r\n      ----“foretell what s’ever was\r\n  By consequence to come to pass;\r\n  As death of great men, alterations,\r\n  Diseases, battles, inundations,\r\n  Or search’d a planet’s house to know\r\n  Who broke and robb’d a house below.\r\n  Examined Venus and the Moon\r\n  To find who stole a silver spoon.”\r\n\r\n  _Butler’s Hudibras._\r\n\r\nThis address was “at the Black Ball and Lilly Head, next door to the\r\nFeather shops that are within Blackfriars gateway, which is over against\r\nLudgate Church, just by Ludgate in London.”[76]\r\n\r\nClassic authors also have come in for their share of signboard\r\npopularity in this country, which, at the time they flourished, was\r\nabout as little civilized as the Sandwich Islands in the days of Captain\r\nCook. These signs were set up by booksellers; thus HOMER’S HEAD was, in\r\n1735, the sign of Lawton Gilliver, against St Dunstan’s Church,\r\npublisher of some of Pope’s works, and in 1761, of J. Walker at Charing\r\nCross. Cicero, under the name of TULLY’S HEAD, hung at the door of\r\nRobert Dodsley, a famous bookseller in Pall Mall. In a newspaper of\r\n1756, appeared some verses “on Tully’s head in Pall Mall, by the Rev. Mr\r\nG----s, of which the following are the first and the last stanzas:--\r\n\r\n  “Where Tully’s bust and honour’d name\r\n  Point out the venal page,\r\n  There Dodsley consecrates to fame\r\n    The classics of his age.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Persist to grace this humble post,\r\n    Be Tully’s head the sign,\r\n  Till future booksellers shall boast\r\n    To sell their tomes at thine.”\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, the favourite Tully’s Head was also the sign of T.\r\nBecket, and P. A. de Hondt, booksellers in the Strand, near Surrey\r\nStreet. HORACE’S HEAD graced the shop of J. White in Fleet Street,\r\npublisher of several of Joseph Strutt’s antiquarian works; and VIRGIL’S\r\nHEAD of Abraham van den Hoeck and George Richmond, opposite Exeter\r\nChange in the Strand, in the middle of the last century. Of SENECA’S\r\nHEAD two instances occur, J. Round in Exchange Alley in 1711, and ----\r\nVarenne, near Somerset House, in the Strand, at the same period.\r\n\r\nA few of our own poets are also common tavern pictures. As early as 1655\r\nwe find a (Ben) JONSON’S HEAD tavern in the Strand, where Ben Jonson’s\r\nchair was kept as a relic.[77] In that same year it was the sign of\r\nRobert Pollard, bookseller, behind the Royal Exchange. Ten years later\r\nit occurs in the following advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “WHEREAS Thomas Williams, of the society of real and well-meaning\r\n  Chymists hath prepaired certain Medicynes for the cure and prevention\r\n  of the Plague, at cheap rates, without Benefit to himself, and for the\r\n  publick good, In pursuance of directions from authority, be it known\r\n  that these said Medicynes are to be had at Mr Thomas Fidges, in\r\n  Fountain Court, Shoe Lane, near Fleet Street, and are also left by him\r\n  to be disposed of at the GREEN BALL, within Ludgate, the Ben Jonson’s\r\n  Head, near Yorkhouse,” &c.[78]\r\n\r\nThere is still a Ben Jonson’s Head tavern with a painted portrait of the\r\npoet in Shoe Lane, Fleet Street; a Ben Jonson’s Inn at Pemberton, Wigan,\r\nLancashire; and another at Weston-on-the Green, Bicester.\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE’S HEAD is to be seen in almost every town where there is a\r\ntheatre. At a tavern with that sign in Great Russell Street, Covent\r\nGarden, the Beefsteak Society (different from the Beefsteak Club,) used\r\nto meet before it was removed to the Lyceum Theatre. George Lambert,\r\nscene-painter to Covent Garden Theatre, was its originator. This tavern\r\nwas at one time famous for its beautifully painted sign. The well-known\r\nLion’s Head, first set up by Addison at Button’s, was for a time placed\r\nat this house.[79] There was another Shakespeare Head in Wych Street,\r\nDrury Lane, a small public-house at the beginning of this century, the\r\nlast haunt of the Club of Owls, so called on account of the late hours\r\nkept by its members. The house was then kept by a lady under the\r\nprotection of Dutch Sam the pugilist. After this it was for one year in\r\nthe hands of the well-known Mr Mark Lemon, present editor of _Punch_,\r\nthen just newly married to Miss Romer, a singer of some renown, who\r\nassisted him in the management of this establishment. The house was\r\nchiefly visited by actors from Covent Garden, Drury Lane, and the\r\nOlympic, whilst a club of literati used to meet on the first floor.\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN FALSTAFF, who so dearly loved his sack, could not fail to\r\nbecome popular with the publicans, and may be seen on almost as many\r\nsignboards as his parent Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nMILTON’S HEAD was, in 1759, the sign of George Hawkins, a bookseller at\r\nthe corner of the Middle Temple gate, Fleet Street; at present there are\r\ntwo Milton’s Head public-houses in Nottingham. DRYDEN’S HEAD was to be\r\nseen in 1761, at the door of H. Payne and Crossley, booksellers in\r\nPaternoster Row. At Kate’s Cabin, on the Great Northern Road, between\r\nChesterton and Alwalton, there is a sign of Dryden’s head, painted by\r\nSir William Beechey, when engaged as a house-painter on the decoration\r\nof Alwalton Hall. Dryden was often in that neighbourhood when on a visit\r\nto his kinsman, John Dryden of Chesterton.\r\n\r\nPOPE’S HEAD was in favour with the booksellers of the last century; thus\r\nthe _Gentleman’s Magazine_, Sept. 1770, mentions a head of Alexander\r\nPope in Paternoster Row, painted by an eminent artist, but does not say\r\nwho the painter was. Edmund Curll, the notorious bookseller in Rose\r\nStreet, Covent Garden, had Pope’s head for his sign, not out of\r\naffection certainly, but out of hatred to the poet. After the quarrel\r\nwhich arose out of Curll’s piratical publication of Pope’s literary\r\ncorrespondence, Curll, in May 22, 1735, addressed a letter of thanks to\r\nthe House of Lords, ending thus,--“I have engraved a new plate of Mr\r\nPope’s head from Mr Jervas’s painting, and likewise intend to hang him\r\nup in effigy for a sign to all spectators of his falsehood and my own\r\nveracity, which I will always maintain under the Scotch motto, ‘Nemo me\r\nimpune lacessit.’” R. Griffiths, a bookseller in St Paul’s Churchyard\r\nsince 1750, had the DUNCIAD for his sign. He was agent for a very\r\nprimitive social-evil movement; advertisements emanating from this “sett\r\nof gentlemen sympathising with the misfortunes of young girls” occur in\r\nthe papers of June and July 1752. One of the regulations was, “☞ None\r\nneed to apply but such as are Fifteen years of age, and not above\r\nTwenty-five: older are thought past being reclaim’d, unless good\r\nRecommendations are given. Drinkers of spirits and swearers have a bad\r\nchance.”\r\n\r\nThe MAN OF ROSS is at the present day a signboard at Wye Terrace, Ross,\r\nHerefordshire; the house in which John Kyrle, the Man of Ross, dwelt,\r\nwas, after his death, converted into an inn. Twenty or thirty years ago\r\nthe following poetical effusion was to be read stuck up in that inn:--\r\n\r\n  “Here dwelt the Man of Ross, O traveller here,\r\n  Departed merit claims the rev’rent tear.\r\n  Friend to the friendless, to the sick man health,\r\n  With generous joy he view’d his modest wealth.\r\n  If ’neath this roof thy wine-cheer’d moments pass,\r\n  Fill to the good man’s name one grateful glass.\r\n  To higher zest shall memory wake thy soul,\r\n  And virtue mingle in th’ ennobled bowl,\r\n  Here cheat thy cares, in generous visions melt,\r\n  And dream of goodness thou hast never felt.”\r\n\r\nThe head of ROWE, the first emendator, corrector, and illustrator of\r\nShakespeare, was in 1735 the sign of a bookseller in Essex Street,\r\nStrand. The CAMDEN HEAD and CAMDEN ARMS occur in four instances as the\r\nsign of London publicans. Camden Town, however, may perhaps take the\r\ncredit of this last sign. ADDISON’S HEAD was for above sixty years the\r\nsign of the then well-known firm of Corbett & Co.--first of C. Corbett,\r\nafterwards of his son Thomas, booksellers in Fleet Street from 1740 till\r\nthe beginning of this century. DR JOHNSON’S HEAD, exhibiting a portrait\r\nof the great lexicographer, is a modern sign in Bolton Court, Fleet\r\nStreet, opposite to where the great man lived, and which was in his time\r\noccupied by an upholsterer. It is sometimes asserted to be the house in\r\nwhich the Doctor resided, but this statement is wrong, for the house in\r\nwhich he had apartments was burned down in 1819. Finally, a portrait of\r\nSterne, under the name of the YORICK’S HEAD, was the sign of John\r\nWallis, a bookseller in Ludgate Street in 1795.\r\n\r\nOf modern poets LORD BYRON is the only one who has been exalted to the\r\nsignboard. In the neighbourhood of Nottingham his portrait occurs in\r\nseveral instances; his MAZEPPA also is a great favourite, but it must be\r\nconfessed its popularity has been greatly assisted by the circus, by\r\nsensational engravings, and, above all, by that love for horse flesh\r\ninnate to the British character. DON JUAN also occurs on a publican’s\r\nsignboard at Cawood, Selby, West Riding; and DON JOHN at Maltby,\r\nRotheram, in the same county; but perhaps these are merely the names of\r\nrace horses.\r\n\r\nThe latest of all literary celebrities who attained sufficient\r\npopularity to entitle him to a signboard was SHERIDAN KNOWLES, who was\r\nchosen as the sign of a tavern in Bridge Street, Covent Garden, facing\r\nthe principal entrance to Drury Lane Theatre, (now a nameless\r\neating-house.) There the Club of Owls used to meet. Sheridan Knowles was\r\none of the patrons, and Augustine Wade, an author and composer of some\r\nfame, was chairman of the club in those days. Pierce Egan and Leman Rede\r\nwere amongst its members; so that it may be conjectured that the nights\r\nwere not passed in moping.[80]\r\n\r\nMythological divinities and heroes, also, have been very fairly\r\nrepresented on our signboards. At this head, of course, BACCHUS\r\n(frequently with the epithet of JOLLY) well deserves to be placed. In\r\nthe time when the BUSH was the usual alehouse sign, or rather when it\r\nhad swollen to a crown of evergreens, a chubby little Bacchus astride on\r\na tun was generally a pendant to the crown. In Holland and Germany we\r\nhave seen a Beer king, (a modern invention, certainly,) named Cambrinus,\r\ntaking the place of Bacchus at the beer-house door; but, according to\r\nthe sixteenth century notions, Bacchus included beer in his dominions.\r\nHence he is styled “Bacchus, the God of brew’d wine and sugar, grand\r\npatron of robpots, upsey freesy tipplers, and supernaculum takers, this\r\nBacchus, who is head warden of Vintner’s Hall, _ale connor_, mayor of\r\nall victualling houses,” &c.--MASSINGER’S _Virgin Martyr_, a. ii. s. l.\r\nNext to Bacchus, APOLLO is most frequent, but whether as god of the sun\r\nor leader of the Muses it is difficult to say. Sometimes he is called\r\nGLORIOUS APOLLO, which, in heraldic language, means that he has a halo\r\nround his head.[81] In the beginning of this century there was a\r\nnotorious place of amusement in St George’s Fields, Westminster Road,\r\ncalled the Apollo Gardens--a Vauxhall or a Ranelagh of a very low\r\ndescription. It was tastefully fitted up, but being small and having few\r\nattractions beyond its really good orchestra, it became the resort of\r\nthe vulgar and the depraved, and was finally closed and built over.\r\n\r\nMINERVA also is not uncommon--probably not so much because she was the\r\ngoddess of wisdom, but as “y^{e} patroness of scholars, shoemakers,\r\ndiers,” &c.[82] JUNO has a temple in Church Lane, Hull, and NEPTUNE of\r\ncourse is of frequent occurrence in a country that holds the\r\n\r\n  “Imperium pelagi sævumque tridentem.”\r\n\r\nThe smith “being generally a thirsty soul, his patron VULCAN constitutes\r\nan appropriate alehouse sign, and in that capacity he frequently\r\nfigures, particularly in the Black country. Amongst the quaint Dutch\r\nsignboard inscriptions there is one which, in the seventeenth century,\r\nwas written under a sign of Vulcan lighting his pipe:--\r\n\r\n          “_In Vulcanus._ Hy steekt zyn pyp op aan ’t vyer\r\n          Die goed tabak wil hebben die komt alhier.\r\n  Je krygt een gestopte pyp toe en op kermis een glas dik bier.”[83]\r\n\r\nVulcan, as the god of fire, without which there is no smoke, was a\r\ncommon tobacconist’s sign in Holland two hundred years ago. One of these\r\ndealers had the following rhymes affixed to his Vulcan sign:--\r\n\r\n  “Vulcan die lamme smid als hy was moei van smeden\r\n  Ging hy wat zitten neer en ruste zyne leden\r\n  De Goden zagen ’t aan, hy haalde uit zyn zak\r\n  Zyn pypye en zyn doos en rookte doen tabak.”[84]\r\n\r\nMERCURY, the god of commerce, was of frequent occurrence, as might be\r\nexpected. Amongst the Banks collection of shop-bills there is one of a\r\nfanshop in Wardour Street with the sign of the MERCURY AND FAN. Both\r\nCUPID and FLORA were signs at Norwich in 1750,[85] and COMUS is\r\nfrequently the tutelary god of our provincial public-houses. CASTOR AND\r\nPOLLUX, represented in the dress of Roman soldiers of the empire\r\nstanding near a cask of tallow, was the sign of T. & J. Bolt,\r\ntallow-chandlers, at the corner of Berner Street, Oxford Street, at the\r\nend of the last century, for the obvious reason that, like the Messrs\r\nBolt, they were two brothers that spread light over the world. Our\r\nadmiration for athletic strength and sports suggested the sign of\r\nHERCULES, as well as his biblical parallel SAMSON.\r\n\r\nAs for the HERCULES PILLARS, this was the classic name for the Straits\r\nof Gibraltar, which by the ancients was considered the end of the world;\r\nin the same classic sense it was adopted on outskirts of towns, where it\r\nis more common now to see the WORLD’S END. In 1667 it was the sign of\r\nRichard Penck in Pall Mall, and also of a public-house in Piccadilly, on\r\nthe site of the present Hamilton Place, both which spots were at that\r\nperiod the end of the inhabited world of London. The sign generally\r\nrepresented the demi-god standing between the pillars, or pulling the\r\npillars down--a strange cross between the biblical and the pagan\r\nHercules.\r\n\r\nThe Pillars of Hercules in Piccadilly is mentioned by Wycherley in the\r\n“Plain Dealer,” 1676:--“I should soon be picking up all our own\r\nmortgaged apostle spoons, bowls, and beakers out of most of the\r\nalehouses betwixt the Hercules Pillars and the BOATSWAIN in Wapping.”\r\nThe Marquis of Granby often visited the former house, and here Fielding,\r\nin “Tom Jones,” makes Squire Western put up:--“The Squire sat down to\r\nregale himself over a bottle of wine with his parson and the landlord of\r\nthe Hercules Pillars, who, as the Squire said, would make an excellent\r\nthird man, and would inform them of the news of the town; for, to be\r\nsure, says he, he knows a great deal, since the horses of many of the\r\nquality stand at his house.”[86] In Pepys’ time there was a Hercules\r\nPillars tavern in Fleet Street. Here the merry clerk of the Admiralty\r\nsupped with his wife and some friends on Feb. 6, 1667-8; his return home\r\ngives a good idea of London after the fire:--\r\n\r\n  “Coming from the Duke of York’s playhouse I got a coach, and a humour\r\n  took us and I carried them to the Hercules Pillars, and there did give\r\n  them a kind of supper of about 7s. and very merry, and home round the\r\n  town, not through the ruins. And it was pretty how the coachman by\r\n  mistake drives us into the ruins from London Wall unto Coleman Street,\r\n  and would persuade me that I lived there. And the truth is, I did\r\n  think that he and the linkman had contrived some roguery, but it\r\n  proved only a mistake of the coachman; but it was a cunning place to\r\n  have done us a mischief in, as any I know, to drive us out of the road\r\n  into the ruins, and there stop, while nobody could be called to help\r\n  us. But we came home safe.”\r\n\r\nATLAS carrying the World was the very appropriate sign of the map and\r\nchart makers. In 1674 there was one in Cornhill,[87] and under a print\r\nof Blanket fair (the fair held on the Thames when frozen over) occurs\r\nthe following imprint:--“A map of the river Thames merrily called\r\nBlanket-fair, as it was frozen in the memorable year 1683-4, describing\r\nthe Booths, Footpaths, Coaches, Sledges, Bull-baitings, and other\r\nremarks. Sold by Joseph Moxon on the West side of Fleet ditch, at the\r\nsign of the ATLAS.” Equally appropriate was ORPHEUS as the sign of the\r\nmusic shop of L. Peppard, next door to Bickerstaffe’s coffee-house,\r\nRussell Street, Covent Garden, 1711. No fault either can be found with\r\nthe GOLDEN FLEECE as the sign of a woollen draper--Jason’s golden fleece\r\nbeing an allegory of the wool trade, but at the door of an inn or\r\npublic-house it looks very like a warning of the fate the traveller may\r\nexpect within--in being fleeced. In the seventeenth century there was a\r\nFLEECE Tavern in St James’s:--\r\n\r\n  “A RARE Consort of four Trumpets Marine, never heard of before in\r\n  England.[88] If any person desire to come and hear it, they may repair\r\n  to the Fleece Tavern near St James’s about 2 o’clock in the afternoon\r\n  every day in the week except Sundays. Every consort shall continue one\r\n  hour and so to begin again. The best places are 1 shilling, the others\r\n  sixpence.”--_London Gazette_, Feb. 1-4, 1674.\r\n\r\nThis is amongst the earliest concerts on record in London. Another\r\nexample of this sign worth mentioning was the Fleece Tavern, (in York\r\nStreet,) Covent Garden, which, says Aubrey, “was very unfortunate for\r\nhomicides; there have been several killed--three in my time. It is now\r\n(1692) a private house. Clifton, the master, hanged himself, having\r\nperjured himself.”[89] Pepys does not give this house a better\r\ncharacter:--“Decemb. 1, 1660. Mr Flower did tell me how a Scotch knight\r\nwas killed basely the other day at the Fleece in Covent Garden, where\r\nthere had been a great many formerly killed.” On the Continent, also,\r\nthis symbol was used; for instance, in 1687, by Jean Camusat, a printer\r\nin the Rue St Jacques, Paris; his colophon represented Jason taking the\r\ngolden fleece off a tree, with the motto--“TEGIT ET QUOS TANGIT\r\nINAURAT.”\r\n\r\nAnother sign, of which the application is not very obvious, is Pegasus\r\nor the FLYING HORSE, unless it refers to this rhyme:--\r\n\r\n  “If with water you fill up your glasses,\r\n    You’ll never write anything wise;\r\n  For wine is the horse of Parnassus,\r\n    Which hurries a bard to the skies.”\r\n\r\n“John Gay, at the Flying Horse, between St Dunstan’s Church and\r\nChancery Lane, 1680,” is an imprint under many ballads. John Gay\r\nundoubtedly had adopted this sign as a compliment to the Templars, in\r\nwhose vicinity he lived, and whose arms are a Pegasus on a field _arg_.\r\nAs for the poor balladmongers, whose works Gay printed, they certainly\r\nput Pegasus too much to the plough, to imagine that he alluded to theirs\r\nas a Flying Horse. Instead of the Flying Horse, a facetious innkeeper at\r\nRogate Petersfield, has put up a parody in the shape of the FLYING BULL.\r\n\r\nThe HOPE and the HOPE AND ANCHOR are constant signs with shop and tavern\r\nkeepers. Pepys spent his Sunday, the 23d September 1660, at the Hope\r\nTavern, in a not very godly manner; and his account shews the curious\r\nbusiness management of the taverns in the time:--\r\n\r\n  “To the Hope and sent for Mr Chaplin, who with Nicholas Osborne and\r\n  one Daniel come to us, and we drank of two or three quarts of wine,\r\n  which was very good; the drawing of our wine causing a great quarrel\r\n  in the house between the two drawers which should draw us the best,\r\n  which caused a great deal of noise and falling out, till the master\r\n  parted them, and came up to us and did give us a long account of the\r\n  liberty he gives his servants, all alike, to draw what wine they will\r\n  to please his customers; and we eat above two hundred walnuts.”\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these excesses Master Pepys was very ill next day, but\r\nthe particulars of the illness, though very graphically entered into the\r\ndiary, are “unfit for publication.”\r\n\r\nThe FORTUNE was adopted from considerations somewhat similar to those\r\nthat prompted the choice of the Hope. It occurs as the sign of a tavern\r\nin Wapping in 1667. The trades tokens of this house represent the\r\ngoddess by a naked figure standing on a globe, and holding a veil\r\ndistended by the wind,--a delicate hint to the customers, for it is a\r\nwell-known fact that a man who has “a sheet in the wind” is as happy as\r\na king. Doubtless the name of the ELYSIUM, a public-house in Drury Lane\r\nabout thirty years ago, had also been adopted as suggestive of the\r\nhappiness in store for the customers who honoured the place by their\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nBallads, novels, chapbooks, and songs, have also given their contingent.\r\nThus, for instance, the BLIND BEGGAR OF BETHNAL GREEN--still a\r\npublic-house in the Whitechapel Road--has decorated the signpost for\r\nages. The ballad was written in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; but the\r\nlegend refers to Henry de Montfort, son of the Earl of Leicester, who\r\nwas supposed to have fallen at the battle of Evesham in the reign of\r\nHenry III. Not only was the Beggar adopted as a sign by publicans, but\r\nhe also figured on the staff of the parish beadle; and so convinced were\r\nthe Bethnal Green folks of the truth of the story, that the house called\r\nKirby Castle was generally pointed out as the Blind Beggar’s palace, and\r\ntwo turrets at the extremity of the court wall as the place where he\r\ndeposited his gains.\r\n\r\nStill more general all over England is GUY OF WARWICK, who occurs\r\namongst the signs on trades tokens of the seventeenth century: that of\r\nPeel Beckford, in Field Lane, represents him as an armed man holding a\r\nboar’s head erect on a spear. The wondrous strange feats of this knight\r\nform the subject of many a ballad. In the Roxburgh Collection there is\r\none headed, “The valiant deads of chivalry atchieved by that noble\r\nknight, Sir Guy of Warwick, who, for the love of fair Phillis, became a\r\nhermit, and dyed in a cave of a craggy rock a mile distant from Warwick.\r\nIn Normandy stoutly won by fight the Emperor’s daughter of Almayne from\r\nmany a valiant, worthy knight.”[90] His most popular feat is the slaying\r\nof the DUN COW on Dunsmore Heath, which act of valour is commemorated on\r\nmany signs.\r\n\r\n  “By gallant Guy of Warwick slain\r\n  Was Colbrand, that gigantick Dane.\r\n  Nor could this desp’rate champion daunt\r\n  A dun cow bigger than elephaunt.\r\n  But he, to prove his courage sterling,\r\n  His whinyard in her blood embrued;\r\n  He cut from her enormous side a sirloin,\r\n  And in his porridge-pot her brisket stew’d,\r\n  Then butcher’d a wild boar, and eat him barbicu’d.”\r\n\r\n  _Huddersford Wiccamical Chaplet._\r\n\r\nA public-house at Swainsthorpe, near Norwich, has the following\r\ninscription on his sign of the Dun Cow:--\r\n\r\n  “Walk in, gentlemen, I trust you’ll find\r\n  The Dun Cow’s milk is to your mind.”\r\n\r\nAnother on the road between Durham and York:--\r\n\r\n  “Oh, come you from the east,\r\n  Oh, come you from the west,\r\n  If ye will taste the Dun Cow’s milk,\r\n  Ye’ll say it is the best.”\r\n\r\nThe KING AND MILLER is another ballad-sign seen in many places. It\r\nalludes to the adventure of Henry II. with the Miller of Mansfield.[91]\r\nSimilar stories are told of many different kings: of King John and the\r\nMiller of Charlton, (from whom Cuckold’s Point got its name;) of King\r\nEdward and the tanner of Drayton Basset; of Henry VIII.; of James V. of\r\nScotland, (the guidman of Ballageich;) of Henry IV. of France and the\r\npig-merchant; of Charles V. of Spain and the cobbler of Brussels; of\r\nJoseph II.; of Frederick the Great; and even of Haroun-al-Raschid, who\r\nused to go about _incognito_ under the name of Il Bondocani.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent of all ballad signs is unquestionably ROBIN HOOD AND\r\nLITTLE JOHN, his faithful accolyte. Robin Hood has for centuries enjoyed\r\na popularity amongst the English people shared by no other hero. He was\r\na crack shot, and of a manly, merry temper, qualities which made the mob\r\noverlook his confused notions about _meum_ and _tuum_, and other\r\npeccadilloes. His sign is frequently accompanied by the following\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\n  “You gentlemen, and yeomen good,\r\n  Come in and drink with Robin Hood.\r\n  If Robin Hood be not at home,\r\n  Come in and drink with Little John.”\r\n\r\nWhich last line a country publican, not very well versed in ballad lore,\r\nthus corrected:--\r\n\r\n  “Come in and drink with Jemmie Webster.”\r\n\r\nAt Bradford, in Yorkshire, the following variation occurs:--\r\n\r\n  “Call here, my boy, if you are dry,\r\n  The fault’s in you, and not in I.\r\n  If Robin Hood from home is gone,\r\n  Step in and drink with Little John.”\r\n\r\nAt Overseal, in Leicestershire:--\r\n\r\n  “Robin Hood is dead and gone,\r\n  Pray call and drink with Little John.”\r\n\r\nFinally, at Turnham Green:--\r\n\r\n  “Try Charrington’s ale, you will find it good.\r\n  Step in and drink with Robin Hood.\r\n                  If Robin Hood,” &c.\r\n\r\nAnd to shew the perfect application of the rhyme, mine host informs the\r\npublic that he is “Little John from the old PACK HORSE,” (a public-house\r\nopposite.)\r\n\r\nOne of the ballads in Robin Hood’s Garland has given another signboard\r\nhero, namely, the PINDAR OF WAKEFIELD,[92] George a Green.\r\n\r\n  “In Wakefielde there lives a jolly Pindar,\r\n  In Wakefielde all on the greene.\r\n  ‘There is neither knight nor squire,’ said the Pindar,\r\n  ‘Nor baron so bold, nor baron so bold,\r\n  Dares make a trespass to the town of Wakefielde,\r\n  But his pledge goes to the Pinfold.’”\r\n\r\nDrunken Barnaby mentions the sign in Wakefield in 1634:--\r\n\r\n  “Straight at Wakefielde I was seen, a’,\r\n  Where I sought for George-a-Green, a’,\r\n  But could find not such a creature,\r\n  _Yet on sign I saw his feature_.\r\n  Whose strength of ale had so much stirr’d me,\r\n  That I grew stouter far than Jordie.”\r\n\r\nThere was formerly a public-house near St Chad’s Well, Clerkenwell,\r\nbearing this sign, which at one period, to judge from the following\r\ninscription, would seem to have been more famous than the celebrated\r\nBagnigge Wells hard by. A stone in the garden-wall of Bagnigge House\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n          ☩\r\n        S. T.\r\n  THIS IS BAGNIGGE\r\n    HOUSE, NEARE\r\n    THE PINDAR A\r\n      WAKEFEILDE.\r\n        1680.\r\n\r\nAmong the more uncommon ballad signs, we find the BABES IN THE WOOD at\r\nHanging Heaton, Dewsbury, West Riding. JANE SHORE was commemorated in\r\nShoreditch in the seventeenth century, as we see from trades tokens.\r\nVALENTINE AND ORSON we find mentioned as early as 1711,[93] as the sign\r\nof a coffee-house in Long Lane, Bermondsey; and there they remain till\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nOther chapbook celebrities are MOTHER SHIPTON, Kentish Town, and Low\r\nBridge, Knaresboro’; which latter village disputes with Shipton, near\r\nLondesborough, the honour of giving birth to this remarkable character\r\nin the month of July 1488. The fact is duly commemorated under her\r\nsignboard in the former place:--\r\n\r\n  “Near to this petrifying wall[94]\r\n  I first drew breath, as records tell.”\r\n\r\nHer life and prophecies have at all times been a favourite theme in\r\npopular literature. If we may believe her biographers, she predicted\r\nthe fall of Cardinal Wolsey, the dissolution of the monasteries, the\r\nestablishment of the Protestant religion under Edward VI., the cruelty\r\nof Queen Mary, the glorious reign of Queen Elizabeth, the defeat of the\r\nArmada, the Plague and Great Fire, and many things not yet come to pass.\r\nLike the Delphic oracles, her predictions were given in metre, and\r\nveiled in mystery. The plague and fire, for instance, are thus\r\nforetold:--\r\n\r\n  “Triumphant death rides London thro’,\r\n  And men on tops of houses go.”\r\n\r\nShe is represented as of a most unprepossessing appearance; although we\r\ncertainly might have expected better from the daughter of a necromancer,\r\nor “the phantasm of Apollo, or some aerial dæmon who seduced her\r\nmother;”--“her body was long, and very big-boned; she had great goggling\r\neyes, very sharp and fiery; a nose of unproportionable length, having in\r\nit many crooks and turnings, adorned with great pimples, and which, like\r\nvapours of brimstone, gave such a lustre in the night, that the nurse\r\nneeded no other light to dress her by in her childhood.”[95]\r\n\r\nAnother necromancer, Merlin, shares renown with Mother Shipton, both in\r\nchapbooks and on signboards. MERLIN’S CAVE is the sign of a public-house\r\nin Great Audley Street, and in Upper Rosomon Street, Clerkenwell, in\r\nwhich places he doubtless still plays his old pranks, of changing men\r\ninto beasts. Innumerable romances and histories of Merlin were printed\r\nin the middle ages. He appears in Geoffrey of Monmouth as early as the\r\ntwelfth century, and Alain de l’Isle gave an ample explanation of his\r\nprophecies in seven books, printed in 1608. “This Merlin,” says M. de la\r\nMonnoye, “tout magicien et fils du diable que l’on l’a cru,” has by the\r\ngood Carmelite, Baptiste Mantuanus, been metamorphosed into a saint. At\r\nthe end of his “Tolentinum,” a poem in three books, in honour of St\r\nNicholas, (anno 1509,) he thus speaks of Merlin:--\r\n\r\n                    “Vitæ venerabilis olim\r\n  Vir fuit et vates, venturi præscius ævi,\r\n  Merlinus, laris infando de semine cretus.\r\n  Hic satus infami coitu pietate refulsit\r\n  Eximia superum factus post funera consors.”[96]\r\n\r\nHis prophecies were also translated into Italian, and printed at Venice\r\nin 1516. The annotators say it was reported that Merlin, by his\r\nenchantments, transported from Ireland those huge stones found in\r\nSalisbury plain. His cave was in Clerkenwell, on the site where the\r\nalehouse now stands, and was in the reign of James I., one of the London\r\nsights strangers went to see.[97]\r\n\r\nWe have a well-known chapbook hero in JACK OF NEWBURY, who had already\r\nattained to the signboard honours in the seventeenth century, when we\r\nfind him on the token of John Wheeler, in Soper Lane (now Queen Street,\r\nCheapside,) whilst at present, he may be seen in a full-length portrait\r\nin Chiswell Street, Finsbury Square. This Jack of Newbury, alias\r\nWinchcombe, alias Smallwoode, “was the most considerable clothier\r\nEngland ever had. He kept an hundred looms in his house, each managed by\r\na man and a boy. He feasted King Henry VIII. and his first Queen\r\nCatherine at his own house in Newbury, now divided into sixteen\r\nclothiers’ houses. He built the Church of Newbury, from the pulpit\r\nwestward to the town.”[98] At the battle of Flodden in 1513, he joined\r\nthe Earl of Surrey with a corps of one hundred men, well equipped at his\r\nsole expense, who distinguished themselves greatly in that fight. He is\r\nburied in Newbury, where his brass effigy is still to be seen,\r\npurporting that he died February 15, 1519. An inn bearing his sign in\r\nNewbury, is said to be built on the site of the house where he\r\nentertained King Harry. Thomas Deloney, the ballad-writer, wrote a tale\r\nabout him, entitled, “The pleasant history of John Winchcomb, in his\r\nyounger years called Jack of Newberry, the famous and worthy clothier of\r\nEngland, declaring his life and love, together with his charitable deeds\r\nand great hospitalitie. Entered in the Stationers’ Book, May 7, 1596.”\r\n\r\nWHITTINGTON AND HIS CAT is still very common, not only in London but in\r\nthe country also. Sometimes the cat is represented without her master,\r\nas on the token of a shop in Longacre, 1657, and on the sign of ----\r\nVarney, a seal-engraver in New Court, Old Bailey, 1783, whose\r\nshopbill[99] represents a large cat carved in wood holding an eye-glass\r\nby a chain. The story of Whittington is still a favourite chapbook tale,\r\nand has its parallel in the fairy tales of various other countries.\r\nStraparola, in his “Piacevole Notte,” is, we believe, the first who\r\nmentions it. The earliest English narrative occurs in Johnson’s “Crown\r\nGarland of Golden Roses,” 1612, but there is an allusion to “Whittington\r\nand his Puss” in the play of “Eastward Hoe!” 1603. For more than a\r\ncentury it was one of the stock pieces of Punch and his dramatic troop.\r\nSept. 21, 1688, Pepys went to see it: “To Southwark Fair, very dirty,\r\nand there saw the puppet-show of Whittington, which is pretty to see;\r\nand how that idle thing do work upon people that see it, and even myself\r\ntoo.” Foote, in his comedy of the “Nabob,” makes Sir Matthew Mite\r\naccount for the legend by explaining the cat as the name of some\r\nquick-sailing vessels by which Whittington imported coals, which should\r\nhave been the source of the Lord Mayor’s wealth. In the Highgate Road\r\nthere is a skeleton of a cat in a public-house window, which by the\r\npeople who visit there is firmly believed to be the earthly remains of\r\nWhittington’s identical cat. The house is not far distant from the spot\r\nwhere the future Lord Mayor of London stopped to listen to the city\r\nbells inviting him to return. It is now marked by a stone, with the\r\nevent duly inscribed thereon.\r\n\r\nKing Arthur’s ROUND TABLE is to be seen on various public-houses. There\r\nis one in St Martin’s Court, Leicester Square, where the American\r\nchampion, Heenan, put up when he came to contest the belt with the\r\nvaliant Tom Sayers. The same sign is also often to be met with on the\r\nContinent. In the seventeenth century there was a famous tavern called\r\n_la Table Roland_ in the Vallée de Misère at Paris. JOHN-O’-GROAT’S\r\nHOUSE is also used for a sign; there was one some years ago in Windmill\r\nStreet, Haymarket; and at present there is a JOHN-O’-GROAT’S in Gray\r\nStreet, Blackfriars Road. Both these and the Round Table contain, we\r\nconceive, some intimation of that even-handed justice observed at the\r\nhouses, where all comers are treated alike, and one man is as good as\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nDARBY AND JOHN, a corruption of Darby and Joan, and borrowed from an old\r\nnursery fable, is a sign at Crowle, in Lincolnshire; and HOB IN THE\r\nWELL, with a similar origin, at Little Port Street, Lynn; whilst SIR\r\nJOHN BARLEYCORN is the hero of a ballad allegorical of the art of\r\nbrewing, &c.\r\n\r\nA favourite ballad of our ancestors originated the sign of the LONDON\r\nAPPRENTICE, of which there are still numerous examples. How they were\r\nrepresented appears from the _Spectator_, No. 428, viz., “with a lion’s\r\nheart in each hand.” The ballad informs us that the apprentice came off\r\nwith flying colours, after endless adventures, one of which was that\r\nlike Richard Cœur-de-Lion--he “robbed the lion of his heart.” The ballad\r\nis entitled “The Honour of an Apprentice of London, wherein he declared\r\nhis matchless manhood and brave adventures done by him in Turkey, and by\r\nwhat means he married the king’s daughter of that same country.”\r\n\r\nThe ESSEX SERPENT is a sign in King Street, Covent Garden, and in\r\nCharles Street, Westminster, perhaps in allusion to a fabulous monster\r\nrecorded in a catalogue of wonders and awful prognostications contained\r\nin a broadside of 1704,[100] from which we learn that, “Before Henry the\r\nSecond died, a dragon of marvellous bigness was discovered at St Osyph,\r\nin Essex.” Had we any evidence that it is an old sign, we might almost\r\nbe inclined to consider it as dating from the civil war, and hung up\r\nwith reference to Essex, the Parliamentary general; for though we have\r\nsearched the chroniclers fondest of relating wonders and monstrous\r\napparitions, we have not succeeded in finding any authority for the St\r\nOsyph Dragon, other than the above-mentioned broadside.\r\n\r\nLiterature of a somewhat higher class than street ballads, has likewise\r\ncontributed material to the signboards. One of the oldest instances is\r\nthe LUCRECE, the chaste _felo-de-se_ of Roman history, who, in the\r\nsixteenth century, was much in fashion among the poets, and was even\r\nsung by Shakespeare. We find that “Thomas Berthelet, prynter unto the\r\nkynges mooste noble grace, dwellynge at the sygne of the Lucrece, in\r\nFletestrete, in the year of our Lorde 1536.” In 1557, it was the sign of\r\nLeonard Axtell, in St Paul’s Churchyard; and in the reign of Charles I.,\r\nof Thomas Purfoot, in New Rents, Newgate Market, both booksellers and\r\nprinters. The COMPLETE ANGLER was _the_ usual sign of fish-tackle\r\nsellers in the last century, and the essays of the _Spectator_ made the\r\ncharacter of SIR ROGER DE COVERLEY very popular with tobacconists.\r\nDOCTOR SYNTAX hangs at the door of many public-houses, as at Preston,\r\nOldham, Newcastle, Gateshead, &c.; the LADY OF THE LAKE at Lowestoft;\r\nDANDIE DINMONT at West Linton, Carlisle; PICKWICK in Newcastle; the RED\r\nROVER, Barton Street, Gloucester;[101] TAM O’ SHANTER, Laurence Street,\r\nYork, and various other towns; ROBIN ADAIR, Benwell, Newcastle. Popular\r\nsongs also belong to this class, as the LASS O’ GOWRIE, Sunderland and\r\nDurham; AULD LANG SYNE, Preston Street, Liverpool; TULLOCH-GORUM and\r\nLOCH-NA-GAR, both in Manchester; ROB ROY, Titheburn Street, Liverpool;\r\nFLOWERS OF THE FOREST, Blackfriars Road. On the whole, however, this\r\nclass of names is much more prevalent in the northerly than in the\r\nsoutherly districts of England. In the south, if we except THE OLD\r\nENGLISH GENTLEMAN, who occurs everywhere, the great JIM CROW is almost\r\nthe only instance of the hero of a song promoted to the signboard.\r\nROBINSON CRUSOE is common to all the seaports of the kingdom, whilst\r\nUNCLE TOM, or UNCLE TOM’S CABIN, is to be found everywhere, not only in\r\nEngland, but also on the Continent. Any little underground place of\r\nrefreshment or beer-house difficult of access, is considered as\r\nfittingly named by Mrs Beecher Stowe’s novel.\r\n\r\nA very appropriate, and not uncommon public-house sign is the TOBY\r\nPHILPOTT. That he well deserves this honour, appears from the following\r\nobituary notice, (in the _Gent. Mag._, Dec. 1810:)--\r\n\r\n  “At the Ewes farm-house, Yorkshire, aged 76, Mr Paul Parnell, farmer,\r\n  grazier, and maltster, who, during his lifetime, drank out of one\r\n  silver pint cup upwards of £2000 sterling worth of Yorkshire Stingo,\r\n  being remarkably attached to Stingo tipple of the home-brewed best\r\n  quality. The calculation is taken at 2d. per cupful. He was the\r\n  _bon-vivant_ whom O’Keefe celebrated in more than one of his\r\n  Bacchanalian songs under the appellation of Toby Philpott.”\r\n\r\nBetween St Albans and Harpenden, there was, some years ago, and perhaps\r\nthere is still, a public-house called the OLD ROSON. This name also\r\nappears to be borrowed from the well-known song, “_Old Rosin_ the Beau,”\r\nbeginning thus:--\r\n\r\n  “I have travell’d this wide world over,\r\n    And now to another I’ll go,\r\n  I know that good quarters are waiting\r\n    To welcome old Rosin the Beau (ter.)\r\n\r\n  When I am dead and laid out on the counter,\r\n    A voice you will hear from below,\r\n  Singing out brandy and water\r\n    To drink to old Rosin the Beau (ter.)\r\n\r\n  You must get some dozen good fellows,\r\n    And stand them all round in a row,\r\n  And drink out of half-gallon bottles,\r\n    To the name of old Rosin the Beau,” &c.\r\n\r\nThese stanzas, and one or two more to the same import, were quite\r\nsufficient to make the old Beau a fit subject for the signboard,\r\nirrespective of his other amiable qualities held forth in the song. The\r\nvery common OLD HOUSE AT HOME, too, is borrowed from a once-popular\r\nballad, the verse of which is too well known to need quotation here.\r\n\r\nThe equally common HEARTY GOOD FELLOW is adopted from a Seven Dials\r\nballad:--\r\n\r\n  “I am a hearty good fellow,\r\n    I live at my ease,\r\n  I work when I am willing,\r\n    I play when I please.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  With my bottle and my glass,\r\n    Many hours I pass,\r\n  Sometimes with a friend,\r\n    And sometimes with a lass,” &c.\r\n\r\nOf signboards portraying artists, but few instances occur; and when they\r\ndo, they are almost exclusively the property of printsellers. We have\r\nonly met with three: REMBRANDT’S HEAD, the sign of J. Jackson,\r\nprintseller, at the corner of Chancery Lane, Fleet Street, 1759; and of\r\nNathaniel Smith, the father (?) of J. T. Smith, in Great May’s\r\nBuildings, St Martin’s Lane. Another member of that family, J. Smith,\r\nwho kept a printshop in Cheapside, where several of Hogarth’s engravings\r\nwere published, assumed the HOGARTH’S HEAD for his sign. The third is\r\nthe VAN DYKE’S HEAD, the sign of C. Philips, engraver and\r\nprint-publisher in Portugal Street, in 1761. Hogarth also had a head of\r\nVan Dyke as his trade symbol, made from small pieces of cork, but being\r\ngilt, he called it the GOLDEN HEAD, (_see under_ Miscellaneous Signs.)\r\n\r\nIn old times, more than at present, music was deemed a necessary adjunct\r\nto tavern hospitality and public-house entertainment. The fiddlers and\r\nballad singers of the “tap” room, however, gave way to the newer brass\r\nband at the doors, and this, in its turn, is now gradually fading before\r\nthe “music hall” and so-called “concert” arrangement. Singing, it may be\r\nremarked, is one of the first follies into which a man falls after a too\r\nfree indulgence in the cup. It is not to be wondered at, therefore, that\r\nmusical signboards should have swung from time to time over the alehouse\r\ndoor. PAGANINI, who contributed so much to the popularity of that\r\nwell-known part of the “Carnival de Venise”--still the shibboleth of all\r\nfiddlers--is of very common occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe love for music is also eloquently expressed by the sign of the\r\nFIDDLER’S ARMS, Gornal Wood, Staffordshire. JENNY LIND seems to be the\r\nonly musician of modern times who has found her way to the signboard. In\r\nthe last century, HANDEL’S HEAD was common; but at the present moment,\r\nno instance of its use remains. The MAID AND THE MAGPIE, a very common\r\ntavern title, is believed to be the only sign borrowed from an opera. In\r\nQueen Anne’s time, there was a PURCELL’S HEAD in Wych Street, Drury\r\nLane, the sign of a music-house. It represented that musician in a\r\nbrown, full-bottomed wig, and green nightgown, and was very well\r\npainted. Purcell, who died in 1682, greatly improved English melody; he\r\ncomposed sonatas, anthems, and the music to various plays. His “Te Deum”\r\nand “Jubilate” are still admired.\r\n\r\nActors, and favourite characters from plays, have frequently been\r\nadopted as signs. The oldest instance we find is TARLETON, or DICK\r\nTARLETON, who, in the sixteenth century, seems to have been common\r\nenough to make Bishop Hall allude to him in his “Satyres,” (b. vi., s.\r\n1)--\r\n\r\n  “O honour far beyond a brazen shrine,\r\n  To sit with Tarlton on an ale-post’s sign.”\r\n\r\nTarleton is seen on the trades token of a house in Wheeler Street,\r\nSouthwark; and it is only within a very few years that this sign has\r\nbeen consigned to oblivion. Richard, or “Dick” Tarleton was a celebrated\r\nlow-comedy actor, born at Condover in Shropshire, and brought to town in\r\nthe household of the Earl of Leicester. He first kept an ordinary in\r\nPaternoster Row, called the CASTLE, much frequented by the booksellers\r\nand printers of St Paul’s Churchyard. Afterwards, he kept the TABOR, in\r\nGracechurch Street. He was one of Queen Elizabeth’s twelve players, in\r\nreceipt of wages, and was at that time living as one of the grooms of\r\nthe chamber at Barn Elms, but lost his situation by reason of some\r\nscurrilous reflections on Leicester and Raleigh. He probably also\r\nperformed at the Curtain in Shoreditch, in which parish he was buried,\r\nSeptember 3, 1588. “The great popularity which Tarlton possessed may be\r\nreadily seen from the numerous allusions to him in almost all the\r\nwriters of the time, and few actors have been honoured with so many\r\npractical tokens of esteem. His portrait graced the ale-house,\r\ngame-cocks were named after him, and a century after his death, his\r\neffigy adorned the jakes.”[102] The portrait of this famous wit is\r\nprefixed to the edition of his jests, printed in 1611, where he is\r\nrepresented in the costume of a clown playing on the tabor and pipe.\r\nAnother portrait of him occurs as an accompaniment to the letter T, in a\r\ncollection of ornamental letters,[103] with the following rhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “This picture here set down within his letter T,\r\n  Aright doth shew the forme and shape of Tharleton unto thee.\r\n  When he in pleasaunt wise the counterfeit expreste,\r\n  Of clowne with cote of russet hew, and startups w^{th} the reste;\r\n  Who merry many made when he appear’d in sight,\r\n  The grave, the wise, as well as rude, att him did take delight.\r\n  The partie now is gone, and closlie clad in claye;\r\n  Of all the jesters in the lande, he bare the praise awaie.\r\n  Now hath he plaied his parte, and sure he is of this,\r\n  If he in Christe did die to live with Him in lasting bliss.”\r\n\r\nSPILLER’S HEAD was the sign of an inn in Clare Market, where one of the\r\nmost famous tavern clubs was held. This meeting of artists, wits,\r\nhumorists, and actors originated with the performances at Lincoln’s Inn,\r\nabout the year 1697. They counted many men of note amongst their\r\nmembers. Colley Cibber was one of the founders, and their best\r\npresident, not even excepting Tom d’Urfey. James Spiller, it should be\r\nstated, was a celebrated actor _circa_ 1700. His greatest character was\r\n“Mat o’ the Mint,” in the Beggar’s Opera. He was an immense favourite\r\nwith the butchers of Clare Market, one of whom was so charmed with his\r\nperformances, that he took down his sign of the BULL AND BUTCHER, and\r\nput up SPILLER’S HEAD. At Spiller’s death, (Feb. 7, 1729,) the following\r\nelegiac verse was made by one of the butchers in that locality:--\r\n\r\n  “Down with your marrow-bones and cleavers all,\r\n  And on your marrow-bones ye butchers fall!\r\n  For prayers from you who never pray’d before,\r\n  Perhaps poor Jimmie may to life restore.\r\n  ‘What have we done?’ the wretched bailiffs cry,\r\n  ‘That th’ only man by whom we lived should die!’\r\n  Enraged they gnaw their wax and tear their writs,\r\n  While butchers’ wives fall in hysteric fits;\r\n  For, sure as they’re alive, poor Spiller’s dead.\r\n  But, thanks to _Jack Legar!_ we’ve got his _head_.\r\n  He was an inoffensive, merry fellow,\r\n  When sober, hipp’d, blythe as a bird when mellow.”\r\n\r\nA ticket for one of his benefit representations, engraved by Hogarth, is\r\nstill a _morceau recherché_ amongst print collectors, as much as £12\r\nhaving been paid for one. “Spiller’s Life and Jests” is the title of a\r\nlittle book published at that time.\r\n\r\nGARRICK’S HEAD was set up as a sign in his lifetime, and in 1768 it hung\r\nat the door of W. Griffiths, a bookseller of Catherine Street, Strand.\r\nIt is still common in the neighbourhood of theatres. There is one in\r\nLeman Street, Whitechapel, not far from the place of his first\r\nsuccesses, where, in 1742, he played at the theatre in Goodman’s Fields,\r\nand “the town ran horn-mad after him,” so that there were “a dozen dukes\r\nof a night at Goodman’s Fields sometimes.”[104]\r\n\r\nROXELLANA was, in the seventeenth century, the sign of Thomas Lacy, of\r\nCateaton Street, (now Gresham Street,) City. It was the name of the\r\nprincipal female character in “The Siege of Rhodes,” and was originally\r\nthe favourite part of the handsome Elizabeth Davenport, whose sham\r\nmarriage to the Earl of Oxford, (who deceived her by disguising a\r\ntrumpeter of his troop as a priest,) is told in De Grammont’s Memoirs.\r\nAfter she had found out the Earl’s deception, she continued under his\r\nprotection, and is occasionally mentioned, (always under the name of\r\nRoxellana,) with a few words of encomium on her good looks by that\r\nentertaining gossip, Pepys.\r\n\r\nFormerly there was a sign of JOEY GRIMALDI at a public-house nearly\r\nopposite Sadler’s Wells Theatre; not only had it the name, but _addidit\r\nvultum verbis_, in the shape of a clown with a goose under his arm, and\r\na string of sausages issuing from his pocket. Joey’s name being less\r\nfamiliar to the public of the present day, the house is now called the\r\nCLOWN. This, we think, is the last instance of an actor being elevated\r\nto signboard honours.\r\n\r\nABEL DRUGGER is one of the _dramatis personæ_ in Ben Jonson’s comedy of\r\nthe Alchymist, and from the character given him by his friend Captain\r\nFace, we get some curious information concerning the mysteries of the\r\ntobacco trade of that day:--\r\n\r\n  “This is my friend Abel, an honest fellow,\r\n  He lets me have good tobacco, and he does not\r\n  Sophisticate it with sack lees or oil,\r\n  Nor washes it with muscadel and grains,\r\n  Nor buries it in gravel underground,\r\n  Wrapp’d up in greasy leather or p---- clouts,\r\n  But keeps it in fine lily pots, that open’d\r\n  Smell like conserve of roses, or French beans.\r\n  He has his maple block, his silver tongs,\r\n  Winchester pipes, and fire of juniper.\r\n  A neat, spruce, honest fellow, and no goldsmith.”\r\n\r\nThis worthy was, in the end of the last century, the sign of Peter\r\nCockburn, a tobacconist in Fenchurch Street, formerly shopman at the SIR\r\nROGER DE COVERLEY, as he informs the public on his tobacco paper.[105]\r\nAccording to the custom of the times, and one which has yet lingered in\r\nold-fashioned neighbourhoods, this wrapper is adorned with some curious\r\nrhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “At DRUGGER’S HEAD, without a puff,\r\n  You’ll ever find the best of snuff,\r\n    Believe me, I’m not joking;\r\n  Tobacco, too, of every kind,\r\n  The very best you’ll always find,\r\n    For chewing or for smoaking.\r\n  Tho’ Abel, when the Humour’s in,\r\n  At Drury Lane to make you grin,\r\n    May sometimes take his station;\r\n  At number Hundred-Forty-Six,\r\n  In Fenchurch Street he now does fix\r\n    His present Habitation.\r\n  His best respects he therefore sends,\r\n  And thus acquaints his generous Friends,\r\n    From Limehouse up to Holborn,\r\n  That his rare snuffs are sold by none,\r\n  Except in Fenchurch Street alone,\r\n    And there by Peter Cockburn.”\r\n\r\nFALSTAFF, whom we have already mentioned when speaking of Shakespeare,\r\nand PAUL PRY, are both very common. The last is even of more frequent\r\noccurrence than “honest Jack” himself.\r\n\r\nLower down in the scale of celebrities and public characters, we find\r\nthe court-jester of Henry VIII., OLD WILL SOMERS, the sign of a\r\npublic-house in Crispin Street, Spittalfields, at the present day. He\r\nalso occurs on a token issued from Old Fish Street, in which he is\r\nrepresented very much the same as in his portrait by Holbein, viz.,\r\nwearing a long gown, with hat on his head, and blowing a horn. Under an\r\nengraving of this picture are the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “What though thou think’st me clad in strange attire,\r\n  Knowe I am suted to my own deseire;\r\n  And yet the characters described upon mee\r\n  May shew thee that a king bestowed them upon mee.\r\n  This horn I have betokens Sommers’ game,\r\n  Which sportive tyme will bid thee reade my name,\r\n  All with my nature well agreeing to\r\n  As both the name, and tyme, and habit doe.”\r\n\r\nFormerly there used to be in the town a wooden figure of Will with rams’\r\nhorns and a pair of large spectacles; and the story was told that he\r\nnever would believe that his wife had presented him with the “bull’s\r\nfeather” until he had seen it through his spectacles.\r\n\r\nTwo portraits of Sommers are preserved at Hampton Court, one in a\r\npicture after Holbein, representing Henry VII. with his queen,\r\nElizabeth, and Henry VIII. with his queen, Jane Seymour. Will is on one\r\nside, his wife on the other. The other portrait is by Holbein,\r\nthree-quarter life size, where he is represented looking through a\r\nclosed window.[106] He also figures in Henry VIII.’s illuminated\r\nPsalter,[107] in which King Henry’s features are given to David, and\r\nthose of Will Sommers to the fool who accompanies him.\r\n\r\nSommers was born at Eston Neston, Northamptonshire, where his father was\r\na shepherd. His popularity arose from his frankness, which is thus\r\neulogised by Ascham in his “Toxophilus:”--“They be not much unlike in\r\nthis to Wyll Sommers, the kingis foole, which smiteth him that standeth\r\nalwayes before his face, be he never so worshipful a man, and never\r\ngreatlye lokes for him which lurkes behinde another man’s backe that\r\nhurte him indeede.”\r\n\r\nWe next come to _Broughton_, the champion pugilist of England in the\r\nreign of George II. He kept a public-house in the Haymarket, opposite\r\nthe present theatre; his sign was a portrait of himself, without a wig,\r\nin the costume of a bruiser. Underneath was the following line, from\r\nÆneid, v. 484:--\r\n\r\n  “HIC VICTOR CÆSTUS, ARTEMQUE REPONO.”\r\n\r\nNumerous public-houses already retail their good things under the\r\nauspices of the great TOM SAYERS. One in Pimlico, Brighton, deserves\r\nespecial mention, as it is reported to be the identical house in which\r\nthe mighty champion made his entry on the stage of this world, for the\r\nnoble purpose of dealing and receiving the blows of fistic fortune. But,\r\nas in the case of Homer’s birthplace, the honour is contested; almost\r\nevery house in Pimlico lays claim to his nativity, and unless the great\r\nman writes his life and settles this mooted point, it is likely to give\r\nserious trouble to future historiographers.\r\n\r\nAnother athlete, TOPHAM, “the strong man,” had also his quantum of\r\nsignboards. “The public interest which his extraordinary exhibitions of\r\nstrength had always excited did not die with him. His feats were\r\ndelineated on many signs which were remaining up to 1800. One in\r\nparticular, over a public-house near the Maypole, in East Smithfield,\r\nrepresented his first great feat of pulling against two dray\r\nhorses.”[108]\r\n\r\nThomas Topham was born in London in 1710. His strength almost makes the\r\nfeats of Homer’s heroes credible, for, besides pulling against two dray\r\nhorses, in which he would have been successful if he had been properly\r\nplaced, he lifted three hogsheads of water, weighing 1836 lbs, broke a\r\nrope two inches in circumference, lifted a stone roller, weighing 800\r\nlbs., by a chain with his hands only, lifted with his teeth a table six\r\nfeet long, with half a hundredweight fastened to the end of it, and held\r\nit a considerable time in a horizontal position, struck an iron poker, a\r\nyard long and three inches thick, against his bare left arm until it was\r\nbent into a right angle, placed a poker of the same dimensions against\r\nthe back of his neck, and bent it until the ends met, and performed\r\ninnumerable other remarkable feats.\r\n\r\nIn DANIEL LAMBERT, whose portly figure acts as sign to a coffee-house on\r\nLudgate Hill, and to a public-house in the High Street, St Martins,\r\nStamford, Lincolnshire, we behold another wonder of the age. This man\r\nweighed no less than 52 stone 11 lb. (14 lbs. to the stone.) He was in\r\nhis 40th year when he died, and the circumstances of his burial give a\r\ngood idea of his enormous proportions. His coffin, in which there was\r\ngreat difficulty of placing him, was 6 ft. 4 in. long, 4 ft. 4 in. wide,\r\nand 2 ft. 4 in. deep. The immense size of his legs made it almost a\r\nsquare case. It consisted of 112 superficial feet of elm, and was built\r\nupon two axletrees and four clogwheels, and upon them his remains were\r\nrolled into the grave, a regular descent having been made by cutting the\r\nearth away for some distance slopingly down to the bottom. The window\r\nand part of the wall had to be taken down to allow his exit from the\r\nhouse in which he died. His demise took place on June 21, 1809.\r\n\r\nOver the entrance to Bullhead Court, Newgate Street, there is a stone\r\nbas-relief, according to Horace Walpole once the sign of a house called\r\nTHE KING’S PORTER AND THE DWARF, with the date 1660. The two persons\r\nrepresented are William Evans and Jeffrey Hudson. Evans is mentioned by\r\nFuller.[109] Jeffrey Hudson, the dwarf, had a very chequered life. He\r\nwas born in 1609 at Okeham in Rutlandshire, from a stalwart father,\r\nkeeper of baiting-bulls to the Duke of Buckingham. Having been\r\nintroduced at court by the Duchess, he entered the Queen’s service. On\r\none occasion, at an entertainment given by Charles I. to his queen, he\r\nwas served up in a cold pie; at another time at a court ball, he was\r\ndrawn out of the pocket of Will Evans, the huge door porter, or keeper,\r\nat the palace. In 1630 he was sent to France to bring over a midwife for\r\nthe queen, but on his return was taken prisoner by Flemish pirates, who\r\nrobbed him of £2500 worth of presents received in France. Sir John\r\nDavenant wrote a comic poem on this occasion entitled “Jeffereïdos.”\r\nDuring the civil wars Jeffrey was a captain of horse in the royal army;\r\nhe followed the queen to France, and there had a duel with a Mr Crofts\r\n(brother of Lord Crofts) whom he shot, for which misdemeanour he was\r\nexpelled the court. Taken prisoner by pirates a second time, he was sold\r\nas a slave in Barbary. When he obtained his liberty he returned to\r\nLondon, but got into prison for participation in the Titus Oates plot,\r\nand died shortly after his release in 1682. Walter Scott has introduced\r\nhim in his “Peveril of the Peak.”\r\n\r\nJeffrey is not the only dwarf who has figured on a signboard, for in the\r\nlast century there was a DWARF TAVERN in Chelsea Fields, kept by John\r\nCoan, a Norfolk dwarf. It seems to have been a place of some attraction,\r\nsince it was honoured by the repeated visits of an Indian king. “On\r\nFriday last the Cherokee king and his two chiefs, were so greatly\r\npleased with the curiosities of the Dwarf’s Tavern in Chelsea Fields,\r\nthat they were there again on Sunday at seven in the evening to\r\ndrink tea, and will be there again in a few days.”--_Daily\r\nAdvertiser_, July 12, 1762. Two years after we find the following\r\nadvertisement:--“Yesterday died at the Dwarf Tavern in Chelsea Fields,\r\nMr John Coan, the unparalleled Norfolk Dwarf.”--_Daily Advertiser_,\r\nMarch 17, 1764.\r\n\r\nThe name of DIRTY DICK, which graces a public-house in Bishopsgate\r\nWithout, was transferred to those spirit stores from the once famous\r\nDIRTY WAREHOUSE formerly in Leadenhall Street, a hardware shop kept in\r\nthe end of the last century by Richard Bentley, _alias_ Dirty Dick, in\r\nwhich premises, until about fifteen or twenty years ago, the signboard\r\nof the original shop was still to be seen in the window. Bentley was an\r\neccentric character, the son of an opulent merchant, who kept his\r\ncarriage and lived in great style. In his early life he was one of the\r\nbeaux in Paris, was presented at the court of Louis XVI., and enjoyed\r\nthe reputation of being the handsomest and best dressed Englishman at\r\nthat time in the capital of France. On his return to London he became a\r\nnew, though not a better, man. Brooms, mops, and brushes were rigorously\r\nproscribed from his shop; all order was abolished, jewellery and\r\nhardware were carelessly thrown together, covered by the same shroud of\r\nundisturbed dust. So they remained for more than forty years, when he\r\nrelinquished business in 1804. The outside of his house was as dirty as\r\nthe inside, to the great annoyance of his neighbours, who repeatedly\r\noffered Bentley to have it cleaned, painted, and repaired at their\r\nexpense; but he would not hear of this, for his dirt had given him\r\ncelebrity, and his house was known in the Levant, and the East and West\r\nIndies, by no other denomination than the “Dirty Warehouse in Leadenhall\r\nStreet.” The appearance of his premises is thus described by a\r\ncontemporary:--\r\n\r\n  “Who but has seen, (if he can see at all,)\r\n  ’Twixt Aldgate’s well-known pump and Leadenhall,\r\n  A curious hardware shop, in generall full\r\n  Of wares from Birmingham and Pontipool!\r\n  Begrimed with dirt, behold its ample front,\r\n  With thirty years’ collected filth upon’t;\r\n  In festoon’d cobwebs pendant o’er the door,\r\n  While boxes, bales, and trunks are strew’d around the floor.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Behold how whistling winds and driving rain\r\n  Gain free admission at each broken pane,\r\n  Safe when the dingy tenant keeps them out,\r\n  With urn or tray, knife-case or dirty clout!\r\n  Here snuffers, waiters, patent screws for corks,\r\n  There castors, cardracks, cheesetrays, knives and forks;\r\n  There empty cases piled in heaps on high,\r\n  There packthread, papers, rope, in wild disorder lie.”\r\n        &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe present Dirty Dick is a small public-house, or rather a tap of a\r\nwholesale wine and spirit business in Bishopsgate Street Without. It has\r\nall the appearance of one of those establishments that started up in the\r\nwake of the army at Varna and Balaclava, or at newly-discovered\r\ngold-diggings. A warehouse or barn without floorboards; a low ceiling,\r\nwith cobweb festoons dangling from the black rafters; a pewter bar\r\nbattered and dirty, floating with beer; numberless gas-pipes, tied\r\nanyhow along the struts and posts, to conduct the spirits from the\r\nbarrels to the taps; sample phials and labelled bottles of wine and\r\nspirits on shelves,--everything covered with virgin dust and\r\ncobweb,--indeed, a place that would set the whole Dutch nation frantic.\r\n\r\nYet, though it has been observed that cleanliness of the body is\r\nconducive to cleanliness of the soul, and _vice versa_, the regulations\r\nof this dirty establishment, (hung up in a conspicuous place,) are more\r\nmoral than those of the cleaner gin-palaces,--as, for instance:--“No man\r\ncan be served twice.”[110] “No person to be served if in the least\r\nintoxicated.” “No improper language permitted.” “No smoking permitted;”\r\nwhilst the last request, for fear of this charming place tempting\r\ncustomers to lounge about, says, “Our shop being small, difficulty\r\noccasionally arises in supplying the customers, who will greatly oblige\r\nby bearing in mind the good old maxim:--\r\n\r\n  ‘When you are in a place of business,\r\n  Transact your business\r\n  And go about your business.’”\r\n\r\nBy a trades token we see that OLD PARR’S HEAD was already in the\r\nseventeenth century the sign of a house in Chancery Lane. _Circa_ 1825,\r\na publican in Aldersgate put up the old patriarch, with the following\r\nmedical advice:--\r\n\r\n    “Your head cool,\r\n    Your feet warm,\r\n  But a glass of good gin\r\n  Would do you no harm.”\r\n\r\nThomas Parr was born in 1483, and dying November 15, 1635, at the age of\r\n152, had lived in the reigns of ten several princes,--viz., Edward IV.,\r\nEdward V., Richard III., Henry VII., Henry VIII., Edward VI., Queen\r\nMary, Queen Elizabeth, James I., and Charles I. He was not the only one\r\nof the family who attained to a great age, for the _London Evening\r\nPost_, August 24, 1757, has the following note:--“Last week died at\r\nKanne, in Shropshire, Robert Parr, aged 124. He was great-grandson of\r\nold Thomas Parr, who died in the reign of King Charles I., and lies\r\nburied in Westminster Abbey. What is very remarkable is, that the father\r\nof Robert was 109; the grandfather 113; and the great-grandfather, the\r\nsaid Thomas, is well known to have died at the age of 152.” Signs of old\r\nParr are still remaining at Gravesend and at Rochester.\r\n\r\nThomas Hobson, (Hobson’s Choice,) the benevolent old carrier, is the\r\nsign of two public-houses in Cambridge,--the one called OLD HOBSON, the\r\nother HOBSON’S HOUSE. His own inn in London was the BULL INN in\r\nBishopsgate Street, where he was represented in fresco, having a £100\r\nbag under his arm, with the words, “The fruitful mother of an hundred\r\nmore.” There is an engraving of him by John Payne, his contemporary,\r\nwhich also represents him holding a bag of money. Under it are these\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n  “Laugh not to see so plaine a man in print;\r\n  The shadow’s homely, yet there’s something in’t.\r\n  Witness the Bagg he wears, (though seeming poore,)\r\n  The fertile Mother of a thousand more.\r\n  He was a thriving man, through lawful gain,\r\n  And wealthy grew by warrantable faime.\r\n  Men laugh at them that spend, not them that gather,\r\n  Like thriving sonnes of such a thrifty father.”\r\n\r\nThe print also informs us that he died at the age of eighty-six, in the\r\nyear 1630. Milton, who wrote two epitaphs upon him, says, that “he\r\nsickened in the time of his vacancy, being forbid to go to London by\r\nreason of the plague.”\r\n\r\nAmong this class of minor celebrities we may also place those who put up\r\ntheir own head for signs. Taylor, the water poet, (see Mourning Crown,\r\npp. 49,) was one of the first. Next to him followed PASQUA ROSEE;\r\naccording to his handbill, “the first who made and publicly sold\r\ncoffee-drink in England.” His establishment was “in St Michael’s Alley,\r\nin Cornhill, at the sign of his own head.” This handbill largely enters\r\ninto the virtues of the “coffee-drink,” gives the natural history of the\r\nplant, prescribes how to make the drink, and advises that “it is to be\r\ndrunk, fasting an hour before, and not eating an hour after, and to be\r\ntaken as hot as possibly can be endured; the which will never fetch the\r\nskin off the mouth, or raise any blisters by reason of that heat.” The\r\nnext enters upon a glowing description of all the evils cured by that\r\ndrink, as fumes, headaches, defluxions of rhumes, dropsy, gout, scurvy,\r\nking’s-evil, spleen, hypochondriac, winds, stone, &c. This coffee-house\r\nwas opened in 1652.\r\n\r\nLEBECK’S HEAD was another instance of the owner setting up his own head\r\nas a sign; and though his name has not filled the trumpet of fame, yet\r\nhad he many times bravely stood the fire, and filled the mouths of his\r\ncontemporaries, for he kept an ordinary (about 1690) at the north-west\r\ncorner of Half-moon Passage, (since called Bradford Street.) The sign\r\nseems to have found imitators at the time, and is even yet kept up by\r\ntradition. There is Lebeck’s Head in Shadwell, High Street; a Lebeck’s\r\nInn and Lebeck’s Tavern in Bristol; and a LEBECK AND CHAFF-CUTTER at a\r\nvillage in Gloucestershire.\r\n\r\nA still more famous house was the PONTACK’S HEAD, formerly called the\r\nWHITE BEAR, in Christ Church Passage, (leading from Newgate Street to\r\nChrist Church.) This tavern having been destroyed by fire, Pontack, the\r\nson of a president of the parliament of Bordeaux, opened a new\r\nestablishment on its site, and assuming his father’s portrait as its\r\nsign, called it the Pontack’s Head. It was the first fashionable\r\neating-house in London, was opened soon after the Restoration, and\r\ncontinued in favour until about the year 1780, when it was pulled down\r\nto make room for the building of the vestry hall of Christ Church. De\r\nFoe describes it as “a constant ordinary for all comers at very\r\nreasonable prices, where you may bespeak a dinner from four or five\r\nshillings a head to a guinea, or what sum you please.”[111] In the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century the dinners had become proverbially\r\nextravagant:--\r\n\r\n  “Now at Pontack’s we’ll take a bit,\r\n  Shall quicken Nature’s appetite.\r\n  Here, shew a room! what have you got?\r\n  The waiter (cries) What have we not?\r\n  All that the season can afford,\r\n  Fresh, fat, and fine, upon my word\r\n  A Guinea ordinary, sir.”\r\n\r\nThis Guinea ordinary was:--\r\n\r\n            “---- every way compleat,\r\n  Adorn’d and beautifully dress’d.\r\n  But what it was could not be guess’d.”\r\n\r\nThe waiter, however, gives the _menu_, which contains--Bird’s nest soup\r\nfrom China; a ragout of fatted snails; bantam pig, but one day old,\r\nstuffed with hard row and ambergris; French peas stewed in gravy, with\r\ncheese and garlick; an incomparable tart of frogs and forced meat; cod,\r\nwith shrimp sauce; chickens _en surprise_, (they had not been two hours\r\nfrom the shell,) and similar dainties.[112] Pontack contributed much\r\ntowards bringing the French wines in fashion, being proprietor of some\r\nof the Bordeaux vineyards which bore his name.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time another tavern flourished, with its master’s head\r\nfor sign; this was CAVEAC’S,[113] celebrated for wine; of him Amhurst\r\nsang:--\r\n\r\n  “Now sumptuously at Caveac’s dine,\r\n  And drink the very best of wine.”\r\n\r\nThough it cannot be said that DON SALTERO put up his portrait for a\r\nsign, yet his coffee-house was named after him, and is still extant\r\nunder the same denomination in Cheyne Walk, Chelsea. This house was\r\nopened in 1695 by a certain Salter, who had been servant to Sir Hans\r\nSloane, and had accompanied him on his travels. Chelsea at that time was\r\na village, full of the suburban residences of the aristocracy, and the\r\npleasant situation of Salter’s house soon made it the resort of merry\r\ncompanions, on their way to or from friends’ villas, or Vauxhall, Jenny\r\nWhin’s, and other places of public resort in the neighbourhood.\r\nVice-Admiral Mundy, on his return from the coast of Spain, amused with\r\nthe pedantic dignity of Salter, christened him Don Saltero, and under\r\nthat name the house has continued till this day.\r\n\r\nFrom his connexion with the great Sir Hans Sloane, and the tradition of\r\na descent from the Tradescants, Salter was of course in duty bound to\r\nhave a museum of curiosities, which, by gifts from Sir Hans and certain\r\naristocratic customers in the army and navy, soon became sufficiently\r\ninteresting to constitute one of the London sights. It existed more than\r\na century, and was at last sold by auction in the summer of 1798. From\r\nhis catalogue[114] (headed with the words, “O RARE!”) we gather that the\r\ncuriosities fully deserved that name, for amongst them we find: “a piece\r\nof St Catherine’s skin;” “a painted ribbon from Jerusalem, with which\r\nour Saviour was tied to the pillar when scourged, with a motto;”[115]\r\n“a very curious young mermaid-fish;” “manna from Canaan, it drops from\r\nthe clouds twice a year, in May and June, one day in each month;” “a\r\npiece of nun’s skin;” “a necklace made of Job’s tears;” “the skeleton\r\n(sic) of a man’s finger;” “petrified rain;” “a petrified lamb, or a\r\nstone of that animal;” “a starved cat in the act of catching two mice,\r\nfound between the walls of Westminster Abbey when repairing;” “Queen\r\nElizabeth’s chambermaid’s hat,” &c.[116]\r\n\r\nA most amusing paper in the _Tatler_, No. 34, gives a full-length\r\nportrait of Salter, who appears to have been an “original.” Music was\r\nhis besetting sin, and with very little excuse for it. In that paper the\r\nmuseum, too, is taken to task. Richard Cromwell used to be a visitor to\r\nthis house, where Pennant’s father, when a child, saw him, “a very neat\r\nold man, with a placid countenance.” Franklin also, when a printer’s\r\napprentice, “one day made a party to go by water to Chelsea in order to\r\nsee the college, and Don Saltero’s curiosities.”\r\n\r\nThere is a rather amusing advertisement of the Don’s in the _Weekly\r\nJournal_ for June 23, 1723:--\r\n\r\n  “SIR,--Fifty years since to Chelsea great,\r\n         From Rodnam on the Irish main,\r\n         I stroll’d with maggots in my pate,\r\n         Where much improved they still remain.\r\n         Through various employs I’ve past,\r\n           Toothdrawer, trimmer, and at last,\r\n         I’m now a gimcrack whim-collector.\r\n           Monsters of all sorts here are seen,\r\n         Strange things in nature as they grew so;\r\n           Some relicks of the Sheba queen,\r\n         And fragments of the famed Bob Cruso;\r\n           Knicknacks to dangle round the wall,\r\n         Some in glass cases, some on shelf;\r\n           But what’s the rarest sight of all,\r\n         Your humble servant shows himself.\r\n           On this my chiefest hope depends.\r\n         Now if you will the cause espouse,\r\n           In journals pray direct your friends\r\n         To my Museum-Coffeehouse;\r\n           And in requital for the timely favour\r\n         I’ll gratis bleed, draw teeth, and be your shaver.\r\n           Nay, that your pate may with my noddle tally,\r\n         And you shine bright as I do--marry shall ye.\r\n           Freely consult my revelation Molly;\r\n         Nor shall one jealous thought create a huff,\r\n           For she has taught me manners long enough.\r\n\r\n  “_Chelsea Knackatory._\r\n\r\n  DON SALTERO.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of his catalogue a list of the donors is added, most of whom,\r\ndoubtless, also frequented his house. Amongst them the following names\r\nappear:--the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Sutherland, Sir John\r\nBalchen, Sir Rob. Cotton, Bart., Sir John Cope, Bart., Sir Thomas de\r\nVeil, Sir Francis Drake, Lady Humphrey, Sir Thomas Littleton, Sir John\r\nMolesworth, the Hon. Capt. William Montague, Sir Yelverton Peyton,\r\nGeorge Selwyn, the Hon. Mr Verney, Sir Francis Windham, &c., besides\r\nnumbers of naval and military officers.\r\n\r\nTHE MOTHER REDCAP is a sign that occurs in various places, as in Upper\r\nHolloway, in the High Street, Camden Town, in Blackburn, Lancashire, in\r\nEdmund’s Lowland, Lincolnshire, &c.: whilst there is a FATHER REDCAP at\r\nCamberwell Green, but he is merely a creature of the publican’s fancy.\r\nFrom the way in which Brathwaite mentions this sign in his “Whimsies of\r\na new Cast of Characters,” 1631, it would seem to have been not uncommon\r\nat that time. “He [the painter] bestows his pencile on an aged piece of\r\ndecayed canvas, in a sooty alehouse where MOTHER REDCAP must be set out\r\nin her colours.” Who the original Mother Redcap was, is believed to be\r\nunknown, but not unlikely it is an impersonification of Skelton’s famous\r\n“Ellinor Rumming,” the alewife.\r\n\r\nThe Mother Redcap at Holloway is named by Drunken Barnaby in his\r\ntravels. Formerly the following verses accompanied this sign:--\r\n\r\n  “Old Mother Redcap, according to her tale,\r\n  Lived twenty and a hundred years by drinking this good ale;\r\n  It was her meat, it was her drink, and medicine besides,\r\n  And if she still had drank this ale, she never would have died.”\r\n\r\nAt one time the Mother Redcap, in Kentish Town, was kept by an old\r\ncrone, from her amiable temper surnamed Mother Damnable.[117] This was\r\nprobably the same person we find elsewhere alluded to under the name of\r\nMother Huff, as in Baker’s “Comedy of Hampstead Heath,” 1706, a. ii. s.\r\n1. “_Arabella._--Well, this Hampstead’s a charming place, to dance all\r\nnight at the Wells, and be treated at _Mother Huff’s_.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.\r\n\r\nTHREE SQUIRRELS.\r\n\r\n(Fleet Street, circa 1668.)\r\n\r\nHAND AND STAR.\r\n\r\n(1550.)\r\n\r\nCHESHIRE CHEESE.\r\n\r\n(Modern sign, Aldermanbury, City.)\r\n\r\nKING’S PORTER AND DWARF.\r\n\r\n(Newgate Street, circa 1668.)\r\n\r\nROYAL OAK.\r\n\r\n(Roxburghe Ballads, 1660.)]\r\n\r\nOnly a few more celebrities now remain to be disposed of; but they are\r\nof such a varied character, and so heterogeneous, that they can scarcely\r\nbe ranged under any of the former divisions: thus we meet with the stern\r\nreformer, MELANCTHON’S HEAD, as the sign of an orthodox publican, in\r\nPark Street, Derby. Pretty NELL GWYNN occurs on several London\r\npublic-houses: one in Chelsea, where she must have been well known,\r\nsince her mother resided in that neighbourhood, and popular tradition\r\nallows Nell to have been one of the principal promoters of the erection\r\nof the famous hospital there. Another house, named after Charles II.’s\r\nfavourite mistress, may be observed in Drury Lane, in which street she\r\nlived, and where Pepys, on May-day, 1667, saw her “standing at her\r\nlodgings door, in her smock sleeves and boddice,” and thought her “a\r\nmighty pretty creature.”\r\n\r\nThe SIR JOHN OLDCASTLE was a tavern, in Coldbathfields, in the beginning\r\nof the last century; near this house, Bagford and a Mr Conyers, an\r\nantiquarian apothecary of Fleet Street, discovered the skeleton of an\r\nelephant in a gravel pit.[118] This house is also named in the following\r\nbill:--[119]\r\n\r\n  “All gentlemen, who are lovers of the ancient and noble exercise of\r\n  archery, are hereby invited, by the stewards of the annual feast for\r\n  the Clerkenwell Archers, to dine with them at Mrs Mary Barton’s, at\r\n  the sign of Sir John Oldcastle, upon Friday, the 18th day of July\r\n  1707, at one of the clock, and to pay the bearer, Thomas Beaumont,\r\n  Master of the Regiment of Archers, two shillings and sixpence, and to\r\n  take a sealed ticket, that the certain number may be known, and\r\n  provision made accordingly.\r\n\r\n  Nathaniel Axtell, Esq.} Stewards.”\r\n  Edward Bromwick, Gent.}\r\n\r\nOpposite this house stood the LORD COBHAM’S HEAD, as appears from the\r\n_Daily Advertiser_ for August 9, 1742, which contains an advertisement\r\npuff of this place, praising its beer at 3d. a tankard, and mentioning\r\nthe concert and illuminations. The correspondent concludes his letter by\r\nsaying: “_Note._--In seeing this great preparation, I thought it a duty\r\nincumbent upon me to inform my fellow-citizens and others, that they may\r\ndistinguish this place from any pretended concerts, which are nothing\r\nbut noise and nonsense, in particular, one that is rightly-styled the\r\n_Hog-concert_,” &c.\r\n\r\nBoth these houses were named after “the Good Lord Cobham,”--Sir John\r\nOldcastle, who married the heiress of the Cobham family--the first\r\nauthor, as well as the first martyr of noble family in England. Being\r\none of the Lollards, he was accused of rebellion, hanged in chains, and\r\nburned alive at St Giles in the Fields, in December 1417. Lord Cobham’s\r\nestates were close to the site of these two public-houses, which were\r\nsupposed to comprise a part of the ancient mansion of that nobleman.\r\n\r\nThe SIR PAUL PINDAR public-house, in Bishopsgate Street Without, is all\r\nthat remains of the splendid mansion of the rich merchant of that name,\r\nwho had here a beautiful park, well stocked with game. The house\r\ncontinues almost in its original state, in the Cinque Cento style of\r\nornament; the best part of it is the façade. In “Londiniana,” ii. p.\r\n137, is an engraving of a lodge, standing in Half-Moon Alley, ornamented\r\nwith figures, which tradition says was the keeper’s lodge of Sir Paul\r\nPindar’s Park. Mulberry trees, and other park-like vestiges, were still\r\nwithin memory in 1829. In Pennant’s time it was already a public-house,\r\nhaving for a sign, “a head, called that of the original owner.” Sir Paul\r\nwas a contemporary of Gresham, the founder of the Exchange. He travelled\r\nmuch, and by that means acquired many languages, which, at that time,\r\nwas a sure way to advancement. James I. sent him as ambassador to the\r\nSultan, from whom he obtained valuable concessions for the English trade\r\nthroughout the Turkish dominions. After his return, he was appointed\r\nfarmer of the customs, and frequently advanced money to King James, and\r\nafterwards to Charles I. In 1639 he was esteemed worth £236,000,\r\nexclusive of bad debts. He expended £19,000 in repairing St Paul’s\r\nCathedral, and contributed large sums to various charities, yet, strange\r\nto say, died insolvent, Aug. 22, 1650, the year after his royal master\r\nhad been beheaded. His executor, William Toomes, was so shocked at the\r\nhopeless state of Sir Paul’s affairs, that he committed suicide, and was\r\nburied with all the degrading ceremonies of a _felo-de-se_.\r\n\r\nThe WELCH HEAD was the sign of a low public-house in Dyot Street, St\r\nGiles. In the last century there was a mendicants’ club held here, the\r\norigin of which dated as far back as 1660, at which time they used to\r\nhold their meetings at the THREE CROWNS in the Poultry. Saunders Welch\r\nwas one of the justices of the peace for Westminster, and kept a regular\r\noffice for the police of that district, in which he succeeded Fielding.\r\nHe died Oct. 31, 1784, and lies buried in the church of St George’s,\r\nBloomsbury. He was a very popular magistrate: a story is told that in\r\n1766 he went unattended into Cranbourne Alley, to quell the riotous\r\nmeetings of the journeymen shoemakers there, who had struck for an\r\nadvance of wages. One of the crowd soon recognised him, when they at\r\nonce mounted him on a beer barrel, and patiently listened to all that he\r\nhad to say. He quieted the rioters, and prevailed upon the master\r\nshoemakers to grant an additional allowance to the workmen. This little\r\nincident, joined to his well-known benevolence, and skill in capturing\r\nmalefactors, gave him that popularity which rewards by a signboard fame.\r\n\r\nThe BEDFORD HEAD, Covent Garden, represented the head of one of the\r\nDukes of Bedford, ground landlords of that district. Pope twice alludes\r\nto this tavern, as a place where to obtain a delicate dinner. This house\r\nMr Cunningham[120] suspects to have occupied the north-east corner of\r\nthe Piazza, and there it appears in a view of old Covent Garden, about\r\n1780, preserved in the “Crowle Pennant,” (vii. p. 25.) There was another\r\nBedford Head in Southampton Street, which was kept by Wildman, the\r\nbrother-in-law of Horne Tooke. A Liberal club used to meet at this\r\nhouse, of which Wilkes was a member, for several years. There is still a\r\nBedford Head in Maiden Lane, hard by, at which the Reunion Literary Club\r\nis held.\r\n\r\nUnder the historical signs may be ranged a class of more modern signs,\r\nreferring to local celebrities,--“mighty hunters before the Lord”\r\nprobably--such as CAPTAIN HARMER, White Horse Plain, Yarmouth; CAPTAIN\r\nROSS ON CLINKER, at Natland, a village in Westmoreland; CAPTAIN DIGBY\r\n(the name of a vessel wrecked), at St Peter’s, Margate; COLONEL\r\nLINSKILL, Charlotte Street, North Shields, &c.\r\n\r\nThe DON COSSACK, so frequently seen, dates from the celebrity acquired\r\nby those troops in the extermination of the unfortunate half-starved and\r\nfrozen soldiers, on their retreat from Moscow; though a more intimate\r\nacquaintance with the formidable Cossacks, during the Crimean campaign,\r\nconsiderably damaged their ancient reputation. The signs of the DRUID,\r\nthe DRUID’S HEAD, the DRUID AND OAK, and the ROYAL ARCH DRUID, are more\r\nto be attributed to various kinds of masonic brotherhoods, than as a\r\nmark of respect paid to our aboriginal clergy. The UNION originated with\r\nthe union of Ireland with this kingdom; the JUBILEE dates from the\r\ncentenary of the revolution of 1688, held with considerable pomp and\r\nnational rejoicing, in 1788. The HERO OF SWITZERLAND, Loughborough Road,\r\nBrixton, and in a few other places, refers to William Tell; and the\r\nSPANISH PATRIOT, (Lambeth Lower Marsh and White Conduit Street,) dates\r\nfrom the excitement of our proposed intervention in the Spanish\r\nSuccession question, in 1833. The SPANISH GALLEON, Church Street,\r\nGreenwich, simply owes its origin to the pictures of our naval victories\r\nin the Greenwich Hospital.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are some of the principal and most curious historic signs.\r\nFrom the perusal of this catalogue, we can draw one conclusion--namely,\r\nthat only a few of what we have termed “historical signs,” outlive the\r\ncentury which gave them birth. If the term of their duration extends\r\nover this period, there is some chance that they will remain in popular\r\nfavour for a long time. Thus, in the case of most heroes of the last\r\ncentury, few publicans certainly will know anything about the Marquis of\r\nGranby, Admiral Rodney, or the Duke of Cumberland, yet their names are\r\nalmost as familiar as the Red Lion, or the Green Dragon, and have indeed\r\nbecome public-household words. Once that stage past, they have a last\r\nchance of continuing another century or two--namely, when those heroes\r\nare so completely forgotten, that the very mystery of their names\r\nbecomes their recommendation; such as the Grave Morris, the Will\r\nSommers, the Jack of Newbury, &c.\r\n\r\n[54] Lloyd’s _Evening Post_, February 11-13, 1761.\r\n\r\n[55] Horace Walpole’s Letters.

In 1679, there was a “Mr Crutch,\r\ngoldsmith, near Temple Bar, at the _Palsgrave Head_.” In a similar way,\r\na bookseller lived at the sign of the _Rainbow_, at the same time as one\r\nFarr, who opened this place as a coffee-house. Another bookseller, James\r\nRoberts, who printed most of the satires, epigrams, and other\r\nwasp-stings against Pope, lived at the _Oxford Arms_, a carriers’ inn in\r\nWarwick Lane.

The instrument is open at the end I\r\ndiscovered, but he would not let me look into it.” Philips, in his “New\r\nWorld of Words,” 1696, describes it as “an instrument with a bellows,\r\nresembling a lute, having a long neck with a string, which being struck\r\nwith a hairbow sounds like a trumpet.”\r\n\r\n[89] Aubrey, Miscellanies upon various subjects.\r\n\r\n[90] See in Bib.

There is a pamphlet In the\r\nHarl. Collection, entitled, “True and Wonderful--a discourse relating a\r\nstrange and monstrous serpent, (or dragon,) lately discovered, and yet\r\nliving, to the great annoyance and divers slaughter both of men and\r\ncattell, by his strong and violent Poyson, in Sussex, two miles from\r\nHorsam, in a woode called St Leonard’s Forrest, and thirtie miles from\r\nLondon, this present month of August 1614.” That this Sussex snake\r\ncaused a great sensation, appears from the fact that seventeen years\r\nafter, it is alluded to in “Whimsies: or, A New Cast of Characters,”\r\n1631: “Nor comes his [the ballad-monger’s] invention far short of his\r\nimagination. For want of truer relations for a neede, he can find you\r\nout a _Sussex dragon_, some sea or inland monster, drawn out by some\r\nShoe Lane man, [_i.e._, a sign-painter; they all lived in Harp Alley,\r\nShoe Lane,] in Gorgon-like features, to enforce more horror in the\r\nbeholder.”\r\n\r\n[101] The title of Cooper’s novel seems to have taken hold of the\r\npopular fancy to an astonishing degree: not only are there several\r\npublic-houses who have adopted it as their sign, but also race-horses,\r\nships, and locomotive engines have been named after it. There is even a\r\nbaked potato-can in the streets of London, decorated with that name; it\r\nis built in the shape of a locomotive-engine, japanned red, and wheeled\r\nabout the streets by an old woman. The name on a brass plate is screwed\r\nto the can, similar to the names of locomotive-engines.\r\n\r\n[102] Introduction to Tarlton’s Jests, by J. O. Halliwell.\r\n\r\n[103] Harl.

We read of it\r\nas early as 1467, when a certain Walter Walters, who kept the Crown in\r\nCheapside, made an innocent Cockney pun, saying he would make his son\r\nheir to the Crown, which so displeased his gracious majesty, King Edward\r\nIV., that he ordered the man to be put to death for high treason.\r\n\r\nThe Crown Inn at Oxford was kept by Davenant, (Sir William Davenant’s\r\nfather.) Shakespeare, on his frequent journeys between London and his\r\nnative place, generally put up at this inn, and the malicious world said\r\nthat young Davenant (the future Sir William) was somewhat nearer related\r\nto him than as a godson only. One day, when Shakespeare was just\r\narrived, and the boy sent for from school to see him, a master of one of\r\nthe colleges, pretty well acquainted with the affairs of the family,\r\nasked the boy why he was going home in so much haste, who answered, that\r\nhe was going to see his godfather Shakespeare. “Fie, child,” said the\r\nold gentleman, “why are you so superfluous? Have you not learnt yet that\r\nyou should not use the name of God in vain?”\r\n\r\nOn the site occupied by the present Bank of England there used to stand\r\nfour taverns; one of them bore the sign of the Crown, and was certainly\r\nin a good line of business, for, according to Sir John Hawkins,[121] it\r\nwas not unusual in those toping days to draw a butt (120 gallons) of\r\nmountain in half-pints in the course of a single morning.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period there was another Crown Tavern in Duck Lane, W.\r\nSmithfield. One of the rooms in that house was decorated by Isaac Fuller\r\n(ob. 1672) with pictures of the Muses, Pallas, Mars, Ajax, Ulysses, &c.\r\nNed Ward praises them highly in his “London Spy.” “The dead figures\r\nappeared with such lively majesty that they begot reverence in the\r\nspectators towards the awful shadows!” Such painted rooms in taverns\r\nwere not uncommon at that period.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the sign of the THREE CROWNS is thus accounted for by\r\nBagford:[122]--“The mercers trading with Collen (Cologne) set vp ther\r\nsinges ouer ther dores of ther Houses the three kinges of Collen, with\r\nthe Armes of that Citye, which was the Three Crouens of the former\r\nkinges, in memory of them, and by those singes the people knew in what\r\nwares they deld in.” Afterwards, like all other signs, it was used\r\npromiscuously, and thus it gave a name to a good old-fashioned inn in\r\nLichfield, the property of Dr Johnson, and the very next house to that\r\nin which the doctor was born.\r\n\r\nFrequently the Royal Crown is combined with other objects, to amplify\r\nthe meaning, or to express some particular prerogative; such are the\r\nCROWN AND CUSHION, being the Crown as it is carried before the king in\r\ncoronation, and other ceremonies. We even meet with the TWO CROWNS AND\r\nCUSHIONS; that is, the Crown for the King and for the Queen, which was\r\nthe sign of a Mr Arne, an upholsterer in Covent Garden, the hero of\r\nseveral _Tatlers_ and _Spectators_, and father of the celebrated\r\nmusician and composer, Dr Arne. This political upholsterer also figures\r\nin a farce by Murphy, entitled “The Upholsterer; or what news?” The four\r\nIndian princes referred to in _Tatler_, No. 155, who came to England in\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne, to implore the help of the British Government\r\nagainst the encroachments of the French in Canada, seem to have lodged\r\nin this man’s house,--a circumstance frequently alluded to in the papers\r\nof the _Tatler_ and other periodicals of the time.\r\n\r\nThe CROWN AND GLOVE refers to the well-known ceremony of the Royal\r\nChampion at the Coronation. It occurs as a sign at Stannington,\r\nSheffield, Eastgate Row, South Chester, &c. The ROYAL CHAMPION himself\r\nfigures in George Street, Oxford. In the _Gazetteer_ for August 20,\r\n1784, we find an anecdote recorded concerning the Royal Champion, which\r\nis almost too good to be true:--“At the coronation of King William and\r\nQueen Mary, the Champion of England dressed in armour of complete and\r\nglittering steel; his horse richly caparisoned, and himself, and beaver\r\nfinely capped with plumes of feathers, entered Westminster Hall while\r\nthe King and Queen were at dinner. And, at giving the usual challenge\r\nto any one that disputed their majesties’ right to the crown of England,\r\n(when he has the honour to drink the Sovereign’s health out of a golden\r\ncup, always his fee,) after he had flung down his gauntlet on the\r\npavement, an old woman, who entered the hall on crutches, (which she\r\nleft behind her,) took it up, and made off with great celerity, leaving\r\nher own glove, with a challenge in it to meet her the next day at an\r\nappointed hour in Hyde Park. This occasioned some mirth at the lower end\r\nof the hall: and it was remarkable that every one was too well engaged\r\nto pursue her. A person in the same dress appeared the next day at the\r\nplace appointed, though it was generally supposed to be a good swordsman\r\nin that disguise. However, the Champion of England politely declined any\r\ncontest of that nature with the fair sex, and never made his\r\nappearance.”\r\n\r\nThe CROWN AND SCEPTRE, another of the royal insignia, is named by\r\nMisson[123] in the following incident:--“Butler, the keeper of the Crown\r\nand Sceptre tavern, in St Martin’s Lane, told me that there was a tun of\r\nred port drunk at his wife’s burial, besides mulled white wine.\r\n_Note._--No men ever goe to women’s burials, nor the women to the men’s;\r\nso that there were none but women at the drinking of Butler’s wine. Such\r\nwomen in England will hold it out with the men, when they have a bottle\r\nbefore them, as well as upon th’ other occasion, and tattle infinitely\r\nbetter than they.”\r\n\r\nThe CROWN AND MITRE, indicative of royalty and the church, is the sign\r\nof a High Church publican at Taunton; and the BIBLE AND CROWN has for\r\nmore than a century and a half been the sign of Rivingtons the\r\npublishers. (See under Religious Signs.) The King and Parliament are\r\nrepresented by the well-known CROWN AND WOOLPACK, which at Gedney\r\nHolbeach, in Lincolnshire, has been corrupted into the CROWN AND\r\nWOODPECKER. The CROWN AND TOWER, at Taunton, may refer to the regalia\r\nkept in the Tower, or to the king being “a tower of strength.” A similar\r\nsymbol seems to be intended in the CROWN AND COLUMN, Ker Street,\r\nDevonport, perhaps implying the strength of royalty when supported by a\r\npowerful and united nation.\r\n\r\nThe CROWN AND ANCHOR, the well-known badge of the Navy, is a great\r\nfavourite. One of the most famous taverns with this sign was in the\r\nStrand, where Dr Johnson often used to “make a night of it.” “Soon\r\nafterwards,” says Boswell, “in 1768, he supped at the Crown and Anchor\r\nin the Strand, with a company whom I collected to meet him. There were\r\nDr Percy, now bishop of Dromore; Dr Douglas, now bishop of Salisbury; Mr\r\nLangton; Dr Robertson, the historian; Dr Hugh Blair, and Mr Thomas\r\nDavis.” On this occasion the great doctor was unusually colloquial, and\r\naccording to his amiable custom “tossed and gored several persons.”\r\n\r\nThe famous “Crown and Anchor Association” against so-called _Republicans\r\nand Levellers_--as the reformers were styled by the ministerial party in\r\n1792--owed its name to this tavern. Its rise and progress is rather\r\ncurious: it was undertaken at the instance of Pitt and Dundas, by John\r\nReeves, a barrister. Reeves, at first, could get no one to join him,\r\nbut, to meet the wishes of his employers, used to go to the Crown and\r\nAnchor, draw up some resolutions, pass them _nem. con._, and sign them\r\n_John Reeves_, chairman: thus being in his own person, meeting,\r\nchairman, and secretary. In this way they were inserted in all the\r\npapers of the three kingdoms, the expense being no object to the persons\r\nconcerned. Meetings of the counties were advertised, but the first,\r\nsecond, and third consisted of Reeves alone, and it was not till the\r\nfourth meeting that he had any coadjutors. The political effervescence\r\ncreated by this society, its imitations and branches, form part of the\r\nhistory of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800 the Farming Society proposed to have an experimental\r\ndinner in order to ascertain the relative qualities of the various\r\nbreeds of cattle in the kingdom; the dinner was planned and patronised\r\nby Sir John Sinclair, and the execution intrusted to Mr Simpkins,\r\nlandlord of the Crown and Anchor, who sent a tender of the most\r\nBrobdignagian dinner probably ever heard of. Twelve kinds of oxen and\r\nsheep of the most famous breed, eight kinds of pork, and various\r\nspecimens of poultry, were to bleed as victims in this holocaust to the\r\ndevil of gluttony; the fish was only to be from fresh waters, such as\r\nwere “entitled to the attention of British farmers;” there were various\r\nkinds of vegetables, nine sorts of bread, besides veal, lamb, hams,\r\npoultry, tarts and puddings, all of which were to be washed down by a\r\nvariety of strong and mild ales, stout, cider, Perry, and “British”\r\nspirits. Tickets one guinea each.[124]\r\n\r\nThe ANCHOR AND CROWN was also the sign of the great booth at Greenwich\r\nfair; it was 323 feet long, and 60 feet wide, was used for dancing, and\r\ncould easily accommodate 2000 persons at a time. The other booths also\r\nhad signs; amongst them were the ROYAL STANDARD, the LADS OF THE\r\nVILLAGE, the BLACK BOY AND CAT, the MOONRAKERS, and others.\r\n\r\nThe CROWN AND DOVE, Bridewell Street, Bristol, may refer to the order of\r\nthe Holy Ghost, or may have been suggested by the THREE PIGEONS AND\r\nSCEPTRE.\r\n\r\nObjects of various trades, with a crown above them, were very common:\r\nthe CROWN AND FAN was an ordinary fan-maker’s sign.[125] The CROWN AND\r\nRASP, belonging to snuff-makers, occurs as the sign of Fribourg and\r\nTreyer, tobacconists, at the upper end of Pall Mall, near the Haymarket,\r\nin 1781: it is still to be seen on the façade of the house. The oldest\r\nform of taking snuff was to scrape it with a rasp from the dry root of\r\nthe tobacco plant; the powder was then placed on the back of the hand\r\nand so snuffed up; hence the name of _râpé_ (rasped) for a kind of\r\nsnuff, and the common tobacconist’s sign of LA CAROTTE D’OR, (the golden\r\nroot,) in France. The rasps for this purpose were carried in the\r\nwaistcoat pocket, and soon became articles of luxury, being carved in\r\nivory and variously enriched. Some of them, in ivory and inlaid wood,\r\nmay be seen at the Hôtel Cluny in Paris, and an engraving of such an\r\nobject occurs in “Archæologia,” vol. xiii. One of the first snuff-boxes\r\nwas the so-called râpé, or _grivoise_ box, at the back of which was a\r\nlittle space for a piece of the root, whilst a small iron rasp was\r\ncontained in the middle. When a pinch was wanted, the root was drawn a\r\nfew times over the iron rasp, and so the snuff was produced and could be\r\noffered to a friend with much more grace than under the above-mentioned\r\nprocess with the pocket grater.\r\n\r\nThe CROWN AND LAST originated with shoemakers, but the gentle craft\r\nhaving the reputation of being thirsty souls, it was also adopted as an\r\nalehouse sign: we find it as such in 1718:--\r\n\r\n  “ON EASTER Monday, at the Crown and Last at Primlico (_sic_) in\r\n  Chelsea road, a silver watch, value 30 sh., is to be bowled for; three\r\n  bowls for six pence, to begin at Eight of the clock in the morning and\r\n  continues till Eight in the evening. N.B.--They that win the watch may\r\n  have it or 30s.”[126]\r\n\r\nThe CROWN AND HALBERT was, in 1790, the sign of a cutler in St Martin’s\r\nChurchyard;[127] the CROWN AND CAN occurs in St John Street; and the\r\nCROWN AND TRUMPET at Broadway, Worcester: this last may either allude to\r\nthe trumpet of the royal herald, or simply signify a crowned trumpet.\r\n\r\nOf the KING’S ARMS, and the QUEEN’S ARMS, there are innumerable\r\ninstances; they are to be found in almost every town or village. The\r\nstory is told that a simple clodhopper once walked ever so many miles to\r\nsee King George IV. on one of his journeys, and came home mightily\r\ndisgusted, for the king had arms like any other man, while he had always\r\nunderstood that his majesty’s right arm was a lion and his left arm a\r\nunicorn.\r\n\r\nGrinling Gibbons, the celebrated carver and sculptor, lived at the sign\r\nof the King’s Arms in Bow Street, from 1678 until 1721, when he died.\r\nThis house is alluded to in the _Postman_, January 24, 1701-2:--\r\n\r\n  “On Thursday, the house of Mr Gibbons, the carver in Bow Street, fell\r\n  down, but by special providence none of the family were killed; but,\r\n  ’tis said, a young girl which was playing in the court being missed,\r\n  is supposed to be buried in the rubbish.”\r\n\r\nAt the Haymarket, corner of Pall Mall, stood the QUEEN’S ARMS tavern, in\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne. At the accession of George I. it was called the\r\nKing’s Arms, and there, in 1734, the Whig party used to meet to plan\r\nopposition to Sir Robert Walpole. This club went by the name of the\r\nRump-steak Club.\r\n\r\nFaulkner[128] says that at the King’s Arms, in the High Street, Fulham,\r\nthe Great Fire of London was annually commemorated on the 1st of\r\nSeptember, and had been continued without interruption until his time.\r\nIt was said to have taken its rise from a number of Londoners who had\r\nbeen burnt out, and who, having no employment, strolled out to Fulham,\r\non their way collecting a quantity of hazel nuts, from the hedges, with\r\nwhich they resorted to this house. A capital picture of the great\r\nconflagration used to be exhibited on that day.\r\n\r\nIn 1568 the prizes of the first lottery held in England were exhibited\r\nat the Queen’s Arms in Cheapside, the house of Mr Dericke, goldsmith to\r\nQueen Elizabeth. There were no blanks, and the prizes consisted of ready\r\nmoney, and “certain sorts of merchandises having been valued and\r\nprized.” It had 400,000 lots of 10s. each, and the profits were to go\r\ntowards repairing the havens of the kingdom. The drawing was at first\r\nintended to have taken place at Dericke’s house, but finally was done at\r\nthe west door of St Paul’s. The programme of this lottery, printed by\r\nBinneman, was exhibited to the Antiquarian Society by Dr Rawlinson in\r\n1748. The next lottery was in 1612. It was drawn on the same plan, and\r\ngranted by King James, as a special favour, for the establishment of\r\nEnglish colonies in Virginia. Thomas Sharpley, a tailor, had the chief\r\nprize, which consisted of £4000 of “fair plate.”\r\n\r\n“On Friday, April 6,” (1781) says Boswell,[129] “Dr Johnson carried me\r\nto dine at a club, which, at his desire, had been lately formed at the\r\nQueen’s Arms in St Paul’s Churchyard. He told Mr Hoole that he wished to\r\nhave a City-club, and asked him to collect one; but, said he, don’t let\r\nthem be patriots. The company were that day very sensible well-behaved\r\nmen.” This same tavern was also patronised by Garrick. “Garrick kept up\r\nan interest in the city by appearing about twice in a winter at Tom’s\r\ncoffeehouse in Cornhill, the usual rendezvous of young merchants at\r\nChangetimes; and frequented a club established for the sake of his\r\ncompany at the Queen’s Arms Tavern in St Paul’s Churchyard, where were\r\nused to assemble Mr Samuel Sharpe, the surgeon; Mr Paterson, the City\r\nsolicitor; Mr Draper, the bookseller; Mr Clutterbuck, a mercer; and a\r\nfew others: they were none of them drinkers, and in order to make a\r\nreckoning, called only for French wines. These were his standing counsel\r\nin theatrical affairs.”[130]\r\n\r\nSometimes we meet with the King’s or Queen’s Arms in very odd\r\ncombinations; thus in the reign of Queen Anne there was a QUEEN’S ARMS\r\nAND CORNCUTTER[131] in King Street, Westminster; the sign of Thomas\r\nSmith, who, according to his handbill, (in the Bagford collection,)\r\nhad, “by experience and ingenuity learnt the art of taking out and\r\ncuring all manner of corns without any pain;” he also sold “the\r\nfamoustest ware in all England, which never fails curing the toothache\r\nin half an hour.” It was customary with those who were “sworn servants\r\nto his Majesty,”--_i.e._, who had the lord chamberlain’s diploma, to set\r\nup the royal arms beside their sign. The said Thomas, however, does not\r\nappear to have had this honour, for not a word about it is mentioned in\r\nhis bill, so that he must have set up the Queen’s Arms merely to blind\r\nthe public. The name of the person who filled the important office of\r\ncorncutter to Queen Anne, I am afraid is lost to posterity, but, _en\r\nrevanche_, we know who drew King Charles II.’s teeth, for the Rev. John\r\nWard has recorded in his Diary.[132] “Upon a sign about Fleetbridge this\r\nis written,--‘Here lives Peter de la Roch and George Goslin, both which,\r\nand no others, are sworn operators to the king’s teeth.’”\r\n\r\nRoyal badges, and the supporters of the arms of various kings, were in\r\nformer times largely used as signs. The following is a list of the\r\nsupporters:--\r\n\r\n  RICHARD II., Two Angels, (blowing trumpets.)\r\n  HENRY IV., Swan and Antelope.\r\n  HENRY V., Lion and Antelope.\r\n  HENRY VI., Two Antelopes.\r\n  EDWARD IV., Lion and Bull.\r\n  EDWARD V., Lion and Hind.\r\n  RICHARD III., Two Boars.\r\n  HENRY VII., Dragon and Greyhound.\r\n  HENRY VIII., Lion and Dragon.\r\n  EDWARD VI., Lion and Dragon.\r\n  MARY, Eagle and Lion.\r\n  ELIZABETH, Lion and Dragon.\r\n  JAMES I., Lion and Unicorn, which have continued ever since.\r\n\r\nOf early royal badges an interesting list occurs in Harl. MS., 304, f.\r\n12:--\r\n\r\n  “King Edward the first after the Conquest, sonne to Henry the third,\r\n  gave a Rose gold, the stalke vert.\r\n\r\n  “King Edward the iij gave a lyon in his proper coulor, armed azure\r\n  langued or. The oustrich fether gold, the pen gold, and a faucon in\r\n  his proper coulor and the Sonne Rising.\r\n\r\n  “The prince of Wales the ostrich fether pen and all arg.\r\n\r\n  “Queen Philipe, wyff of Edward the iij^{d}. gave the whyte hynd.\r\n\r\n  “Edmond, Duk of York, sonne of Edward the iij, gave the Faucon arg.\r\n  and the Fetterlock or.\r\n\r\n  “Richard the second gave the White hart, armed, horned, crowned or,\r\n  and the golden son.\r\n\r\n  “Henry, sonne to the Erl of Derby, first Duk of Lancaster, gave the\r\n  red rose uncrowned, and his ancestors gave the Fox tayle in his prop.\r\n  coulor and the ostrich fether ar. the pen ermyn.\r\n\r\n  “Henry the iiij gave the Swan ar. and the antelope.\r\n\r\n  “Henry the v gave the Antelope or, armed, crowned, spotted (?) and\r\n  horned gold and the Red Rose oncrowned and the Swan silver, crown and\r\n  collar gold, by the Erldom of Herford.\r\n\r\n  “Henry the vi gave the same that his father gave.\r\n\r\n  “Edward the iiij gave the Whyte Lyon and the Whyte Rose and the Blak\r\n  Bull uncrowned.\r\n\r\n  “Richard the iij gave the Whyte Boar and the Whyte Rose, the clayes\r\n  gold.\r\n\r\n  “Henry the seventh gave the hawthorn tree vert and the Porte Cullys\r\n  and the Red Rose and the Whyte Crowned.\r\n\r\n  “The Ostrych fether silver, the pen gobone sylver and azur, is the Duk\r\n  of Somerset’s bage.\r\n\r\n  “The Shypmast with the tope and sayle down is the bage of . . .\r\n\r\n  “The Cresset and burnyng fyer is the bage of the Admyraltye.\r\n\r\n  “The Egle Russet with a maydenshead, abowt her neke a Crowne gold, is\r\n  the bage of the mannor of Conysborow.\r\n\r\n  “The Duk of York’s bage is the Faucon and the Fetterlock.\r\n\r\n  “The Whyte Rose by the Castell of Clyfford.\r\n\r\n  “The Black Dragon by the Erldom of Ulster.\r\n\r\n  “The Black Bull horned and clayed gold by the honor of Clare.\r\n\r\n  “The Whyte Hynd by the fayre mayden of Kent.\r\n\r\n  “The Whyte Lyon by the Erldom of Marche.\r\n\r\n  “The ostrych fether silver and pen gold ys the kinges.\r\n\r\n  “The ostrych fether pen and all sylver ys the Prynces.\r\n\r\n  “The ostrych fether sylver, pen ermyn is the Duke of Lancasters.\r\n\r\n  “The ostrych fether sylver and pen gobone is the Duke of Somersets.”\r\n\r\nMany of these badges, as will be seen afterwards, have come down on\r\nsignboards even to the present day. Equally common are the Stuart\r\nbadges, which were:--\r\n\r\nThe red rose of Lancaster and the white rose of York frequently placed\r\non sunbeams; sometimes the red rose charged with the white.\r\n\r\nThe rose dimidiated with the pomegranate, symbolical of the connexion\r\nbetween England and Spain by the marriage of Catherine of Arragon; for\r\nthe same reason the castle of Castille, and the sheaf of arrows of\r\nGranada, occur amongst their badges.\r\n\r\nThe portcullis, borne by the descendants of John of Gaunt, who was born\r\nin Beaufort Castle, whence, _pars pro toto_, the gate was used to\r\nindicate the castle.\r\n\r\nThe falcon and fetterlock, badge of Henry VII., on account of his\r\ndescent from Edmond of Langley, Duke of York.\r\n\r\nThe red dragon, the ensign of the famous Cadwaller, the last of the\r\nBritish kings, from whom the Tudors descended.\r\n\r\nThe hawthorn bush crowned, which Henry VII. adopted in allusion to the\r\nroyal crown of Richard III. having been found hidden in a hawthorn bush\r\nafter the battle of Bosworth.\r\n\r\nThe white falcon crowned and holding a sceptre was the badge of Queen\r\nAnna Boleyn, and of Queen Elizabeth her daughter.\r\n\r\nThe phœnix in flames was adopted by Edward VI. in allusion to his birth,\r\nhaving been the cause of his mother’s death; afterwards he also granted\r\nthis badge to the Seymour family.\r\n\r\nIn pondering over this class of signs great difficulty often arises from\r\nthe absence of all proof that the object under consideration was set up\r\nas a badge, and not as a representation of the actual animal. As no\r\namount of investigation can decide this matter, we have been somewhat\r\nprofuse in our list of badges, in order that the reader should be able\r\nto form his own opinion upon that subject. Thus, for instance, with the\r\nfirst sign that offers itself, the ANGEL AND TRUMPET, it is impossible\r\nto say whether the supporters of Richard II. gave rise to it, or whether\r\nit represents Fame. Various examples of it still occur, and a very good\r\ncarved specimen may be seen above a draper’s shop in Oxford Street. It\r\nis also the name of alehouses in King Street, Holborn, and in Stepney,\r\nHigh Street, &c.\r\n\r\nThe ANTELOPE is not very common now, although in 1664 there was a tavern\r\nwith this sign in W. Smithfield, the trades token of this house bearing\r\nthe following legend:--BIBIS. VINUM. SALUTA. ANTELOP. The Rev. John Ward\r\ntells a very feeble college joke concerning the Antelope Tavern in\r\nOxford:--\r\n\r\n  “I have heard of a fellow at Oxford, one Ffrank Hil by name, who kept\r\n  the Antelope; and if one yawned, hee could not chuse but yawne, that\r\n  vppon a time some schollars hawing stoln his ducks, hee had them to\r\n  the Vice chancelor, and one of the scholars got behind the Vice\r\n  chancelor, and when the fellow beganne to speak hee would presently\r\n  fall a yawning, insomuch that the Vice chancelor turned the fellow\r\n  away in great indignation.”[133]\r\n\r\nMacklin, the centenarian comedian, who died in 1797, used for thirty\r\nyears and upwards to visit a public-house called the Antelope in White\r\nHart yard, Covent Garden, where his usual beverage was a pint of stout\r\nmade hot and sweetened almost to a syrup. This, he said, balmed his\r\nstomach, and kept him from having any inward pains.[134] He died at the\r\nage of upwards of 107, a proof that if, as the teetotallers inform us,\r\nfermented liquors be a poison, it is certainly a slow one.\r\n\r\nThe DRAGON appears to have been one of the oldest heraldic charges of\r\nthis kingdom. It was the standard of the West Saxons, and continued so\r\nuntil the arrival of William the Conqueror, for in the Bayeux tapestry a\r\nwinged dragon on a pole is constantly represented near the person of\r\nKing Harold. It was likewise the supporter of the royal arms of Henry\r\nVII. and all the Tudor sovereigns except Queen Mary. Before that time it\r\nhad been borne by some of the early Princes of Wales, and also by\r\nseveral of the kings. Thus it is recorded, 28 Hen. III., the king\r\nordered to be made--\r\n\r\n  “Unum draconem in modum unius vexilli de quodam rubro sanulo, qui\r\n  ubique sit de auro extensillatus, cujus lingua sit facta tamquam ignis\r\n  comburens et continue appareat moveatur, et ejus oculi fiant de\r\n  sapphiris vel de aliis lapidibus eidem convenientibus.”[135]\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Lewes, 1264, the chronicler says that--\r\n\r\n  “The king schewed forth his schild his Dragon full austere.”[136]\r\n\r\nIn that time, however, it appears not to have been the royal standard,\r\nbut it was borne along with it, for Matthew of Westminster says, “Regius\r\nlocus erat inter Draconem et standardum.”[137] Edward III., at the\r\nbattle of Crescy, also had a standard “with a dragon of red silk adorned\r\nand beaten with very broad and fair lilies of gold.” Then, again, it\r\noccurs on a coin struck in the reign of Henry VI., and was also one of\r\nthe badges of Edward IV.\r\n\r\nThe GREEN DRAGON was of very frequent occurrence on the signboard. When\r\nTaylor, the water poet, wrote his “Travels through London,” there were\r\nnot less than seven Green Dragons amongst the metropolitan taverns of\r\nthat day. One of these is still in existence, the well-known Green\r\nDragon in Bishopsgate Street, for nearly two centuries one of the most\r\nfamous coach and carriers’ inns. At present it is simply a public-house.\r\nThe RED DRAGON is much less common, whilst the WHITE DRAGON occurs on a\r\ntrades token of Holborn, representing a dragon pierced with an arrow,\r\nevidently some family crest.\r\n\r\nThe WHITE HART was the favourite badge of Richard II. At a tournament\r\nheld in Smithfield in 1390, in honour of the Count of St Pol, Count of\r\nLuxemburg, and the Count of Ostrevant, eldest son of Albert, Count of\r\nHolland and Zealand, who had been elected members of the garter, “all\r\nthe kynges house were of one sute; theyr cotys, theyr armys, theyr\r\nsheldes, and theyr trappours, were browdrid all with whyte hertys, with\r\ncrownes of gold about their neck, and cheynes of gold hanging thereon,\r\nwhiche hertys was the kynges leverye that he gaf to lordes, ladyes,\r\nknyghtes, and squyers, to knowe his household people from others.”[138]\r\n\r\nThe origin of this White Hart, with a collar of gold round its neck,\r\ndates from the most remote antiquity. Aristotle[139] reports that\r\nDiomedes consecrated a white hart to Diana, which, a thousand years\r\nafter, was killed by Agathocles, king of Sicily. Pliny[140] states that\r\nit was Alexander the Great, who caught a white stag and placed a collar\r\nof gold round its neck. This marvellous story highly pleased the fancy\r\nof the mediæval writers, always in quest of the wonderful. They\r\nsubstituted Julius Cæsar for Alexander the Great, and transplanted the\r\nfable to western regions, in consequence of which various countries now\r\nclaim the honour of having produced the white hart, collared with gold.\r\nOne was said to have been caught in Windsor Forest, another on Rothwell\r\nHaigh Common, in Yorkshire, a third at Senlis, in France, and a fourth\r\nat Magdeburg. This last was killed by Charlemagne. The same emperor is\r\nalso reported to have caught a white stag in the woods of Holstein, and\r\nto have attached the usual golden collar round its neck. More than three\r\ncenturies after, in 1172, this animal was killed by Henry the Lion, and\r\nthe whole story is, to this day, recorded in a Latin inscription on the\r\nwalls of Lubeck Cathedral.\r\n\r\nAmongst the oldest inns which bore this sign, the White Hart, in the\r\nHigh Street, Borough, ranks foremost in historical interest. Here it was\r\nthat Jack Cade established his headquarters, July 1, 1450. “And you,\r\nbase peasants, do ye believe him? Will you needs be hanged with your\r\npardons about your necks? Hath my sword therefore broken through London\r\ngates, that ye should leave me at the White Hart in Southwark.”--_Henry\r\nVI._, p. ii. a. 1. s. 8. In the yard of that inn he beheaded “one\r\nHawaydyne of Sent Martyns.”[141] Many and wild must have been the scenes\r\nof riot and debauchery enacted in this place during the stay of the\r\nreckless rebel. The original inn that had sheltered Cade and his\r\nfollowers, remained standing till 1676, when it was burnt down in the\r\ngreat fire that laid part of Southwark in ashes. It was rebuilt, and the\r\nstructure is still in existence; in Hatton’s time (1708) it could boast\r\nof the largest sign in London except one, which was at the Castle Tavern\r\nin Fleet Street. Charles Dickens has immortalised the White Hart Inn, by\r\na most lifelike description in his “Pickwick Papers.”\r\n\r\nThe White Hart Tavern, in Bishopsgate, is also of very respectable\r\nantiquity. It has the date 1480 in the front. Standing on the boundary\r\nof the old hospital of Bethlehem, it is probable that this building\r\nformed part of that religious house. Doubtless it was the hostelry or\r\ninn for the entertainment of strangers, which was a usual outbuilding\r\nbelonging to the great hospitals in those days.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen Elizabeth there was a White Hart Inn in the\r\nStrand, mentioned in a copy of an indenture of lease, from the Earl of\r\nBedford to Sir William Cecil (7th September 1570) of a portion of\r\npasture in Covent Garden, “beinge thereby devyeded from certayne gardens\r\nbelonginge to the Inne called the Whyte Heart, and other Tenements\r\nscituate in the high streate of Westm’ comunly called the Stronde.” It\r\nis not improbable that this inn gave its name to Hart Street and White\r\nHart Yard, in that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThere was another inn of this name in Whitechapel, connected with the\r\nname of a rather curious character, Mrs Mapp, the female bone-setter.\r\n“On Friday, several persons who had the misfortune of lameness, crowded\r\nto the WHITE HART Inn in Whitechapel, on hearing Mrs Mapp, the famous\r\nbonesetter, was there. Some of them were admitted to her, and were\r\nrelieved as they apprehended. But a gentleman who happened to come by\r\ndeclared Mrs Mapp was at Epsom, on which the woman thought proper to\r\nmove off.”[142] The genuine Mrs Sarah Mapp was a female bone-setter, or\r\n“shape mistress,” the daughter of a bonesetter of Hindon, Wilts. Her\r\nmaiden name was Wallis. It appears that she made some successful cures\r\nbefore Sir Hans Sloane, in the Grecian Coffee-house. For a time she was\r\nin affluent circumstances, kept a carriage and four, had a plate of ten\r\nguineas run for at the Epsom races, where she lived, frequented\r\ntheatres, and was quite the lion of a season. Ballads were made upon\r\nher, songs were introduced on the stage, in which the “Doctress of\r\nEpsom” was exalted to the tune of Derry Down; in short, she was called\r\nthe “Wonder of the Age.” But, alas! the year after all this _éclat_, we\r\nread in the same _Grub Street Journal_, that had recorded all her\r\ngreatness--“December 22, 1737. Died last week at her lodgings, near the\r\nSeven Dialls, the much-talked of Mrs Mapp, the bonesetter, so miserably\r\npoor, that the parish was obliged to bury her.” _Sic transit gloria\r\nmundi!_\r\n\r\nLastly, we must mention the White Hart, at Scole, in Norfolk, as most of\r\nall bearing upon our subject, for that inn had certainly the most\r\nextensive and expensive sign ever produced. It is mentioned by Sir\r\nThomas Brown, March 4, 1663/4--“About three miles further, I came to\r\nScoale, where is a very handsome inne, and the noblest sighnepost in\r\nEngland, about and upon which are carved a great many stories as of\r\nCharon and Cerberus, Actæon and Diana, and many others; the signe itself\r\nis a _White Hart_, which hanges downe carved in a stately wreath.” A\r\ncentury later, it is again mentioned. Speaking of Osmundestone, or\r\nScole, Blomefield says--“Here are two very good inns for the\r\nentertainment of travellers. The _White Hart_ is much noted in these\r\nparts, being called by way of distinction Scole Inn; the house is a\r\nlarge brick building adorned with imagery and carved work in several\r\nplaces, as big as the life; it was built in 1655 by James Peck, Esq.,\r\nwhose arms impaling his wife’s are over the porch door. The sign is very\r\nlarge, beautified all over with a great number of images of large\r\nstature carved in wood, and was the work of Fairchild; the arms about it\r\nare those of the chief towns and gentlemen in the county.” “There was\r\nlately a very round large bed, big enough to hold 15 or 20 couples, in\r\nimitation (I suppose) of the remarkable great bed at Ware. The house was\r\nin all things accommodated at first for large business; but the road not\r\nsupporting it, it is much in decay at present.” A correspondent in\r\n_Notes and Queries_ says:--“I think the sign was not taken down till\r\nafter 1795, as I have a recollection of having passed under it when a\r\nboy, in going from Norwich to Ipswich.” We obtain full details of this\r\nwonderful erection from an engraving made in 1740, entitled:--\r\n\r\n  “The North East side of y^{e} sign of y^{e} White Heart at Schoale Inn\r\n  in Norfolk, built in the year 1655 by James Peck, a merchant of\r\n  Norwich, which cost £1057. Humb^{ly} Dedicated to James Betts, Gent.,\r\n  by his most ob^{t} serv^{t}, Harwin Martin.”\r\n\r\nThe sign passed over the road, resting on one side on a pier of\r\nbrickwork, and joined to the house on the other; its height was\r\nsufficient to allow carriages to pass beneath. Its ornamentation was\r\ndivided into compartments, which contained the following subjects\r\naccording to the numbers in the engraving:--1. Jonah coming out of the\r\nfish’s mouth. 2. A Lion supporting the arms of Great Yarmouth. 3. A\r\nBacchus. 4. The arms of Lindley. 5. The arms of Hobart. 6. A Shepherd\r\nplaying on his pipe. 7. An Angel supporting the arms of Mr Peck’s lady.\r\n8. An Angel supporting the arms of Mr Peck. 9. A White Hart [the sign\r\nitself] with this motto,--“IMPLENTUR VETERIS BACCHI PINGUISQUE FERINÆ.\r\nANNO DOM. 1655.” 10. The arms of the Earl of Yarmouth. 11. The arms of\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk. 12. Neptune on a Dolphin. 13. A Lion supporting the\r\narms of Norwich. 14. Charon carrying a reputed Witch to Hades. 15.\r\nCerberus. 16. A Huntsman. 17. Actæon [addressing his dogs with the words\r\n“ACTÆON EGO SUM, DOMINUM COGNOSCITE VESTRUM.”] 18. A White Hart couchant\r\n[underneath, the name of the maker of the sign, _Johannes Fairchild,\r\nstruxit_.] 19. Prudence. 20. Fortitude. 21. Temperance. 22. Justice. 23.\r\nDiana. 24. Time devouring an infant [underneath, “TEMPUS EDAX RERUM.”]\r\n25. An Astronomer, who is seated on a “circumferenter, and by some\r\nchymical preparations is so affected that in fine weather he faces that\r\nquarter from which it is about to come.” There is a ballad on this sign\r\nin “Songs and other Poems,” by Alexander Brome, Gent. London, 1661, p.\r\n123.\r\n\r\nThis herd of white harts has led us over a large tract of ground, but we\r\nwill now return to other royal badges, and note the HAWK AND BUCKLE,\r\nwhich occurs in Wrenbury, Nantwich, Cheshire; Etwall, Derby; and various\r\nother places. This is simply a popular rendering of the Falcon and the\r\nFetterlock, one of the badges of the house of York. The HAWK AND BUCK,\r\nwhich appears to be only another version of the last corruption, occurs\r\nat Pearsly Sutton Street, St Helens, Lancashire; the FALCON AND\r\nHORSE-SHOE, a sign in Poplar in the seventeenth century, (_see_ Trades’\r\nTokens,) may have had the same origin, whilst the BULL AND STIRRUP, in\r\nUpper Northgate, Chester, probably comes from the Bull and Fetterlock,\r\nanother combination of badges of the house of York.\r\n\r\nFrom this family are also derived the BLUE BOAR and the WHITE BOAR. One\r\nof the badges of Richard, Duke of York, father of Edward IV., was “a\r\nblewe Bore with his tuskis and his cleis and his membres of gold.”[143]\r\nThe heraldic origin of this sign, of which there are still innumerable\r\ninstances all over England, is now so completely lost sight of, that in\r\nmany places it passes under the ignoble appellation of the BLUE PIG.\r\n\r\nThe WHITE BOAR was the popular sign in Richard the Third’s time, that\r\nking’s cognizance being a boar passant argent, whence the rhyme which\r\ncost William Collingborne his life:--\r\n\r\n  “The Cat, the Rat, and Lovell our Dogge,\r\n  Rulen all England vnder _an Hogge_.”[144]\r\n\r\nThe fondness of Richard for this badge appears from his wardrobe\r\naccounts for the year 1483, one of which contains a charge “for 8000\r\nbores made and wrought upon fustian,” and 5000 more are mentioned\r\nshortly afterwards. He also established a herald of arms called Blanc\r\nSanglier, and it was this trusty squire who carried his master’s mangled\r\nbody from Bosworth battle-field to Leicester.\r\n\r\nAfter Richard’s defeat and death the White Boars were changed into Blue\r\nBoars, this being the easiest and cheapest way of changing the sign; and\r\nso the Boar of Richard, now painted “true blue,” passed for the Boar of\r\nthe Earl of Oxford, who had largely contributed to place Henry VII. on\r\nthe throne. Even the White Boar Inn at Leicester, in which Richard\r\npassed the last night of his royalty and of his life, followed the\r\ngeneral example, and became the Blue Boar Inn, under which sign it\r\ncontinued until taken down twenty-five or thirty years ago. The bed in\r\nwhich the king slept was preserved, and continued for many generations\r\none of the curiosities shewn to strangers at Leicester. It was said that\r\na large sum of money had been discovered in its double bottom, which the\r\nlandlord himself quietly appropriated. The discovery, however, got wind,\r\nand his widow was killed and robbed by some of her guests, in connivance\r\nwith a maid-servant. They carried away seven horse-loads of treasure.\r\nThis murder was committed in 1605.[145]\r\n\r\nThe sign of the White Boar, however, did not become quite extinct with\r\nthe overthrow of the York faction, for we find it still in 1542, as\r\nappears from the following title of a very scarce book:--\r\n\r\n  “David’s Harp full of most delectable harmony newly strung and set in\r\n  Tune by Thos. Basille y^{e} Lord Cobham. _Imprinted at London in\r\n  Buttolp lane at y^{e} sign of y^{e} White Boar by John Mayler for John\r\n  Gough_, 1542.”[146]\r\n\r\nThe FIREBEACON, a sign at Fulston, Lincolnshire, was a badge of Edward\r\nIV., and also of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\nThe HAWTHORN, or HAWTHORNBUSH, which we meet in so many places, may be\r\nHenry VII.’s badge, but various other causes may have contributed to the\r\npopularity of that sign, such as the custom of gathering bunches of\r\nhawthorn on the first of May. Magic powers, too, are attributed to this\r\nplant. “And now,” says Reginald Scott, “to be delivered from witches\r\nthemselves they hange in their entrees an hearb called pentaphyllon,\r\ncinquefole, also an oliue branch, also franckincense, myrrh, valerian\r\nveruen, palme, anterihmon, &c.; also _Haythorne, otherwise whitethorne,\r\ngathered on Maiedaie_,” &c.[147]\r\n\r\nThe GUN, or CANNON, was the cognizance of King Edward VI., Queen Mary,\r\nand Queen Elizabeth. In the beginning of the eighteenth century it was\r\nof such frequent occurrence that the _Craftsman_, No. 638,\r\nobserved--“Nothing is more common in England than the sign of a cannon.”\r\nSarah Milwood, the “wanton” who led George Barnwell astray, lived,\r\naccording to the ballad, in Shoreditch, “next door unto the Gun.” At the\r\npresent day it is still a great favourite. In the neighbourhood of\r\narsenals its adoption is easily explained.\r\n\r\nAbout eighty years ago there was a famous Cannon Coffee-house at the\r\ncorner of Trafalgar Square, at the end of Whitcombe Street or Hedgelane;\r\nits site is now occupied by the Union Club. From this coffeehouse\r\nHackman saw Miss Ray drive past on her way to Covent Garden Theatre,\r\nwhen he followed and shot her as she was entering her coach after the\r\nperformance. The Gun was also a sign with many booksellers, as in the\r\ncase of Edward White at the Little North Door of St Paul’s Church,\r\n1579; Thomas Ewster in Ivy Lane, 1649; Henry Brome, at the West End of\r\nSt Paul’s Churchyard, 1678, and various others.\r\n\r\nThe SWAN was a favourite badge of several of our kings, as Henry IV.,\r\nEdward III. At a tournament in Smithfield the last king wore the\r\nfollowing rather profane motto:--\r\n\r\n  “Hay, hay, the wyth Swan,\r\n  By God’s soule I am thy man.”\r\n\r\nThomas Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester, used the same cognizance; whence\r\nGower styles him “cignus de corde benignus;” whilst Cecily Nevil,\r\nDuchess of York, mother of Edward IV. and Richard III., likewise had a\r\nswan as supporter of her arms.\r\n\r\nThe sign of the SWAN AND MAIDENHEAD, at Stratford-on-Avon, may have\r\noriginated in one of the royal badges; for we find that in 1375 the\r\nBlack Prince bequeathed to his son Richard his hangings for a hall,\r\nembroidered with mermen, and a border of red and black empaled,\r\nembroidered with _swans having ladies’ heads_.[148] The SWAN AND FALCON\r\n(two badges of Edward III.) was a sign in Hereford, in 1775, as appears\r\nfrom the following advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “HEREFORD MACHINE.\r\n\r\n  “IN a Day and a Half twice a week, continues flying from the Swan and\r\n  Falcon, in Hereford, Monday and Thursday mornings; and from the\r\n  Bolt-in-Tun, in Fleet Street, London, Monday and Thursday evenings.\r\n  Fare 19s.; outsides half.”--_Hereford Journal, January 12, 1775._\r\n\r\nThe SWAN AND WHITE HART may have been originally the Swan and Antelope,\r\nsupporters of the arms of Henry IV., but as it at present stands two\r\ndistinct royal badges are represented. This sign occurs on a\r\ntrades-token of St Giles in the Fields, in the second half of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe RISING SUN was a badge of Edward III., and forms part of the arms of\r\nIreland; but the Sun Shining was a cognizance of several kings. Various\r\nother causes may have led to the adoption of that luminary as a sign.\r\n(See Miscellaneous Signs.)\r\n\r\nLions have been at all times, and still continue, greater signboard\r\nfavourites than any other heraldic animals. The lion rampant most\r\nfrequently occurs, although in late years naturalism has crept in, and\r\nthe _felis leo_ is often represented standing or crouching, quite\r\nregardless of his heraldic origin. The lion of the signboard being\r\nseldom seen _passant_, it is more than probable that it was not derived\r\nfrom the national coat of arms, but rather from some badge, either that\r\nof Edward III. or from the WHITE LION of Edward IV. Though silver in\r\ngeneral was not used on English signboards yet, the White Lion was\r\nanything but uncommon. Several examples occur amongst early booksellers.\r\nThus in 1604 the “Shepherd’s Calendar” was “printed at London by G.\r\nElde, for Thomas Adams, dwelling in Paule’s Churchyarde, at the signe of\r\nthe White Lion.” In 1652 we meet with another bookseller, John Fey, near\r\nthe New Exchange; and about the same period John Andrews, a ballad\r\nprinter, near Pye Corner, who both had the sign of the White Lion. For\r\ninns, also, it was not an uncommon decoration. Thus the White Lion in St\r\nJohn’s Street, Clerkenwell, was originally an inn frequented by\r\ncattle-drovers and other wayfarers connected with Smithfield market.\r\nFormerly it was a very extensive building, two of the adjoining houses\r\nand part of White Lion Street, all being built on its site. The house\r\nnow occupied by an oilshop was in those days the gateway to the\r\ninn-yard, and over it was the sign, in stone relief, a lion rampant,\r\npainted white, inserted in the front wall. It still remains in its\r\noriginal position, with the date 1714, when it was probably renewed.\r\nPepys’s cousin, Anthony Joyce, drowned himself in a pond behind this\r\ninn. He was a tavern-keeper himself, and kept the THREE STAGS at\r\nHolborn, (a house of which tokens are extant.) Heavy losses by the fire\r\nof 1666 preyed upon his mind. He imagined that he had not served God as\r\nhe ought to have done, and in a moment of despair committed the rash\r\nact. We have another, and not uninteresting instance, of this sign. Sir\r\nThomas Lawrence’s father kept the White Lion Hotel at Bristol. He\r\nafterwards removed to the Bear, at Devizes, where he failed in business.\r\nIt seemed that it was this last speculation in hotel-keeping which\r\nruined him, with reference to which local wits used to say, “It was not\r\nthe Lion but the Bear that eat him up.”--_Bristol Times_, June 4, 1859.\r\n\r\nSince pictorial or carved signs have fallen into disuse, and only names\r\ngiven, the SILVER LION is not uncommon, though in all probability simply\r\nadopted as a change from the very frequent Golden Lion. Thus there is\r\none in the High Street, Poplar; in the London Road, and Midland Road,\r\nDerby; in the Lilly Road, Luton, Herts, &c. The Red Lion is by far the\r\nmost common; doubtless it originated with the badge of John of Gaunt,\r\nDuke of Lancaster, married to Constance, daughter of Don Pedro the\r\nCruel, king of Leon and Castille. The duke bore the lion rampant gules\r\nof Leon as his cognizance, to represent his claim to the throne of\r\nCastille, when that was occupied by Henry de Transtamare. In after years\r\nit may often have been used to represent the lion of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe Red Lion Inn at Sittingbourne is a very ancient establishment. A new\r\nlandlord, who entered _circa_ 1820, issued the following\r\nadvertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “WM. WHITAKER having taken the above house, most respectfully solicits\r\n  the custom and support of the nobility and gentry, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n  “The antiquity of the inn, and the respectable character which it has\r\n  in history are recorded as under:--\r\n\r\n  “Sittingbourne, in Kent, is a considerable thoroughfare on the Dover\r\n  Road, where there are several good inns, particularly the Red Lion,\r\n  which is remarkable for an entertainment, made by Mr John Norwood, for\r\n  King Henry the Fifth, _as he returned from the battle of Agincourt, in\r\n  France, in the year 1415, the whole amounting to no more than Nine\r\n  Shillings and Ninepence_. Wine being at that time only a penny a pint,\r\n  and all other things being proportionably cheap.\r\n\r\n  _P.S._--The same character in a like proportionate degree Wm. Whitaker\r\n  hopes to obtain by his moderate charges at the present time.”\r\n\r\nRed Lion Square, Holborn, was called after an inn known as the Red Lion.\r\n“Andrew Marvell lies interred under y^{e} pews in the south side of St\r\nGiles church in y^{e} Fields, under the window wherein is painted on\r\nglasse, a red lyon, (it was given by the Inneholder of the Red lyon\r\nInne, Holborn.)”[149]\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated tavern was the Old Red Lion, St John’s Road,\r\nIslington,--which has been honoured by the presence of several great\r\nliterary characters. Thomson, of the “Seasons,” was a frequent visitor;\r\nPaine, the author of the “Rights of Man,” lived, here; and Dr Johnson,\r\nwith his friends, are said often to have sat in the parlour. Hogarth\r\nintroduced its gable end in his picture of Evening.\r\n\r\nThe BLACK LION is somewhat uncommon; it may have been derived from the\r\ncoat of arms of Queen Philippa of Hainault, wife of Edward III.[150] We\r\nfind an example of it in the following advertisement:--[151]\r\n\r\n  “AT THE UNION SOCIETY at the Black Lion against Short’s Garden in\r\n  Drury Lane, a Linen Draper’s, on Thursday the 21st past, _was_ opened\r\n  three offices of Insurance on the birth of Children, by way of\r\n  dividend. At the same place there is two offices for marriages,” &c.\r\n\r\nIn this advertisement we touch upon the joint-stock mania then raging.\r\nNewspapers of the time teemed with advertisements of insurance companies\r\nof all sorts: the above paper, with less than a dozen advertisements,\r\noffers four schemes, by which on payment of 10s. per week £1000 were\r\neventually to be received!\r\n\r\nAmong the badges of the Tudors, Henry VII. and Henry VIII. left us the\r\nstill common sign of the PORTCULLIS.\r\n\r\n  “A portcullis, or porte-coulisse, is French for that wooden instrument\r\n  or machine, plated over with iron, made in the form of a harrow or\r\n  lozenge, hung up with pullies in the entries of gates or castles, to\r\n  be let down upon any occasion.”--_Anstis Garter._\r\n\r\nIt is the principal charge in the arms of the city of Westminster, and\r\nis to be seen everywhere within and without the beautiful chapel of\r\nHenry VII., whose favourite device it was as importing his descent from\r\nthe house of Lancaster. It was also one of the badges of Henry VIII.,\r\nwith the motto, _Securitas Altera_, and occurs on some of his coins.\r\n\r\nTo this same family we also owe the ROSE AND CROWN, which sign, at the\r\npresent day, may be observed on not less than forty-eight public-houses\r\nin London alone, exclusive of beer-houses. One of the oldest is in the\r\nHigh Street, Knightsbridge, which has been licensed above three hundred\r\nyears, though not under that name, for anciently it was called the\r\nOLIVER CROMWELL. The Protector’s bodyguard is said to have been\r\nquartered here, and an inscription to that effect was formerly painted\r\nin front of the house, accompanied by an emblazoned coat of arms of\r\nCromwell, on an ornamental piece of plaster work, which last is all that\r\nnow remains of it. It is the oldest house in Brompton, was formerly its\r\nlargest inn, and not improbably the house at which Sir Thomas Wyatt put\r\nup, while his Kentish followers rested on the adjacent green. Corbould\r\npainted this inn under the title of “The Old Hostelrie at\r\nKnightsbridge,” exhibited in 1849, but he transferred its date to 1497,\r\naltering the house according to his own fancy.\r\n\r\nDuring the persecutions, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, of booksellers\r\nsuspected as publishers of the mysterious Martin Marprelate tracts, we\r\nfind one Bogue, at the loyal sign of the Rose and Crown, in St Paul’s\r\nChurchyard, who fell into the category of the suspected, and who was so\r\nseverely persecuted that he was almost ruined by it.\r\n\r\nOne more royal, or rather princely badge remains to be mentioned,--The\r\nFEATHERS, PRINCE OF WALES’ FEATHERS, occasionally varied to the PRINCE\r\nOF WALES’ ARMS. Ostrich feathers were from a very early period among the\r\ndevices of our kings and princes. King Stephen, for instance, according\r\nto Guillim, bore a plume of ostrich feathers with the motto:--VI NULLA\r\nINVERTITUR ORDO, _No force alters their fashion_, meaning that no wind\r\ncan ruffle a feather into lasting disorder. Not only the Black Prince,\r\nbut also Edward III., himself and his sons, bore ostrich feathers as\r\ntheir cognizances, each with some distinction in colour or metal. The\r\nbadge originally took the form of a single feather. John Ardern,\r\nphysician to the Black Prince, who is the first to mention the\r\nderivation of the feathers from the King of Bohemia, says:--\r\n\r\n  “Et nota quod _talem pennam albam_ portabat Edwardus primogenitus\r\n  filius Edwardi regis super crestam suam, et _illam pennam_ conquisivit\r\n  de rege Boemiæ, quem interfecit apud Cresse in Francia, et sic\r\n  assumpsit sibi _illam pennam_ quæ dicitur _ostrich feather_, quam\r\n  prius dictus rex nobilissimus portabat super crestam.”[152]\r\n\r\nThe feather, also, is drawn in the margin of the MS. as single, and in\r\nthat shape, too, it is represented on the Black Prince’s tomb. This\r\nfeather, however, appears only to have been an ornament on the helmet of\r\nKing John of Bohemia. A contemporary Flemish poem, quoted by Baron van\r\nReiffenberg, thus describes his heraldic crest:--\r\n\r\n  “Twee ghiervogelen daer aen geleyt\r\n  Die al vol bespringelt zyn\r\n  Met Linden bladeren gult fyn,\r\n  Deze is, as ik merken kan\r\n  Van Bohemen Koninck Jan.”[153]\r\n\r\nAnd in that shape it also occurs on the King’s seal. More difficulties\r\nare offered by the motto: HOU MOET ICH DIEN, for so it is in full,--the\r\nBlack Prince himself wrote it after this fashion in a letter dated April\r\n25, 1370. The last two words in German mean “I serve,” but no\r\nexplanation is given of the remainder, “Hou moet.” Since no mottos in\r\ntwo languages occur, we must look for a language which can account for\r\nboth parts of the motto; and thus in Flemish we find these words to\r\nmean, “Keep courage, I serve,” or, in less concise language, “Keep\r\ncourage, I serve with you, I am your companion in arms;” and though no\r\nparentage has as yet been found for this motto, it may not improbably\r\nhave been derived from the Black Prince’s maternal family, since his\r\nmother, Queen Philippa of Hainault, was a Flemish princess.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many shops which took the feathers for their sign we find\r\nthe following noted in an advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “THE LATE Countess of Kent’s powder has been lately experimented upon\r\n  divers infected persons with admirable success. The virtues of it\r\n  against the Plague and all malignant distempers are sufficiently known\r\n  to all the Physicians of Christendom, and the Powder itself prepared\r\n  by the only person living that has the true Receipt, is to be had at\r\n  the third part of the ordinary price at Mr Calvert’s, at the Feathers\r\n  in the old Pall Mall near St James’s,” &c.\r\n\r\nThis, and other advertisements announcing equally efficacious panacea,\r\nappeared daily in the London papers during the plague of 1665. De Foe,\r\nin his little chronicle of the plague, often speaks of these quack\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\nLess dismal images are called up by “the Feathers at the side of\r\nLeicester Fields,” which sign was evidently complimentary to its\r\nneighbour Frederick, Prince of Wales, son of George II., who lived at\r\nLeicester House, “the pouting house of princes,” when on bad terms with\r\nhis father, and died there in 1751. The back parlour of this tavern was\r\nfor some years the meeting-place of a club of artists and well-known\r\namateurs, amongst whom Stuart, the Athenian traveller; Scott, the marine\r\npainter; Luke Sullivan, the miniature artist, engraver of the March to\r\nFinchley; burly Captain Grose, author of the “Antiquities of England,”\r\nand the greatest wit of his day; Mr Hearne, the antiquary; Nathaniel\r\nSmith, the father of J. T. Smith; Mr John Ireland, then a watchmaker in\r\nMaidenlane, and afterwards editor of Boydell’s edition of Dr Trusler’s\r\n“Hogarth Moralised,” and several others. When this house was taken down\r\nto make way for Dibdin’s theatre, called the Sans-souci, the club\r\nadjourned to the COACH AND HORSES, in Castle Street, Leicester Fields.\r\nBut, in consequence of the members not proving customers sufficiently\r\nexpensive for that establishment, the landlord one evening venturing to\r\nlet them out with a farthing candle, they betook themselves to Gerard\r\nStreet and thence to the BLUE POSTS in Dean Street, where the club\r\ndwindled to two or three members and at last died out.\r\n\r\nAn amusing anecdote is told about the Feathers, Grosvenor Street West. A\r\nlodge of Oddfellows was held at this house, into the private chamber of\r\nwhich George, Prince of Wales, one night intruded very abruptly with a\r\nroystering friend. The society was, at the moment, celebrating some of\r\nits awful mysteries, which no uninitiated eye may behold, and these were\r\nwitnessed by the profane intruders. The only way to repair the sacrilege\r\nwas to make the Prince and his companion “Oddfellows,” a title they\r\ncertainly deserved as richly as any members of the club. The initiatory\r\nrites were quickly gone through, and the Prince was chairman for the\r\nremainder of the evening. In 1851 the old public-house was pulled down\r\nand a new gin palace built on its site, in the parlour of which the\r\nchair used by the distinguished Oddfellow is still preserved, along with\r\na portrait of his Royal Highness in the robes of the order.\r\n\r\nAmong the badges and arms of countries and towns, the national emblem\r\nthe Rose is most frequent, and has been so for centuries. Bishop Earle\r\nobserves, “If the _vintner’s Rose_ be at the door it is sign sufficient,\r\nbut the absence of this is supplied by the ivy-bush.” Hutton, in his\r\n“Battle of Bosworth,” says that “upon the death of Richard III., and the\r\nconsequent overthrow of the York faction, all the signboards with white\r\nroses were pulled down, and that none are to be found at the present\r\nday.” This last part of the statement, we believe, is true, but that the\r\nWhite Roses were not all immediately done away with appears from the\r\nfact that, in 1503, a _White Rose_ Tavern was demolished to make room\r\nfor the building of Henry VII.’s chapel in Westminster; that tavern\r\nstood near the chapel of Our Lady, behind the high altar of the abbey\r\nchurch. At present, however, as the rose on the signboard represents in\r\nthe eye of the public simply the Queen of Flowers,--its heraldic history\r\nhaving been forgotten long ago,--it is painted any colour according to\r\ntaste, or occasionally gilt. Long after the famous battles between the\r\nWhite and Red Roses had ceased, the custom was continued of adding the\r\ncolour to the name of the sign. Thus, in Stow, “Then have ye one other\r\nlane called Rother Lane, or _Red Rose_ Lane, of such a sign,” &c. In\r\nLancashire we meet, in one or two instances, with the old heraldic\r\nflower, as at Springwood, Chadderton, Manchester, where the RED ROSE OF\r\nLANCASTER is still in full bloom on a publican’s signboard.\r\n\r\nSkelton’s “Armony of Byrdes” was “imprynted at Londo’ by John Wyght\r\ndwelling in Poule’s Church yarde at the sygne of the Rose.” Machyn, in\r\nhis Diary, mentions many instances:--“The vij day of Aprill (1563) at\r\nseint Katheryns beyond the Toure, the wyff of the syne of the Rose, a\r\ntavarne, was set on the pelere for ettyng of rowe flesse and rostyd\r\nboyth,” which in our modern English means that she was put in the\r\npillory for breaking fast in Lent.\r\n\r\nThe Rose Tavern in Russell Street, Covent Garden, was a noted place for\r\ndebauchery in the seventeenth century; constant allusions are made to it\r\nin the old plays. “In those days a man could not go from the Rose Tavern\r\nto the Piazzi once but he must venture his life twice.”--_Shadwell, the\r\nScowrers_, 1691. “Oh no, never talk on’t. There will never be his\r\nfellow. Oh! had you seen him scower as I did; oh! so delicately, so like\r\na gentleman! How he cleared the Rose Tavern!”--_Ibid._ In this house,\r\nNovember 14, 1712, the duel between the Duke of Hamilton and Lord Mohun\r\nwas arranged, in which the latter was killed. In the reign of Queen Anne\r\nthe place was still a great resort for loose women; hence in the “Rake\r\nReformed,” 1718--\r\n\r\n  “Not far from thence appears a pendant sign,\r\n  Whose bush declares the product of the vine,\r\n  Where to the traveller’s sight the full-blown _Rose_\r\n  Its dazzling beauties doth in gold disclose,\r\n  And painted faces flock in tallied cloaths.”\r\n\r\nHogarth has represented one of the rooms of the house in his “Rake’s\r\nProgress.” In 1766 this tavern was swallowed up in the enlargements of\r\nDrury Lane by Garrick, but the sign was preserved and hung up against\r\nthe front wall, between the first and second floor windows.[154]\r\n\r\nTwo other Roses, not without thorns, are mentioned by Tom Brown:--\r\n\r\n  “Between two Roses down I fell,\r\n  As ’twixt two stools a platter;\r\n  One held me up exceeding well,\r\n  Th’ other did no such matter.\r\n  The Rose by Temple Bar gave wine\r\n  Exchanged for _chalk_, and filled me,\r\n  But being for the _ready coin_,\r\n  The Rose in Wood Street killed me.”\r\n\r\nThe “Rose by Temple Bar” stood at the corner of Thanet Place. Strype\r\nsays it was “a well customed house, with good conveniences of rooms and\r\na good garden.” Walpole mentions a painted room in this tavern in his\r\nletters of January 26 and March 1, 1776. The Rose in Wood Street was a\r\nspunging-house: “I have been too lately under their [the Bayliffs’]\r\nclutches, to desire any more dealings with them, and I cannot come\r\nwithin a furlong of the _Rose spunging-house_ without five or six yellow\r\nboys in my pocket to cast out those devils there, who would otherwise\r\ninfallibly take possession of me.”--_Tom Brown’s Works_, iii. p. 24.\r\n\r\nInnumerable other Rose inns and taverns might be mentioned, but we will\r\nconclude with noting the Rose Inn at Wokingham, once famous as the\r\nresort of Pope and Gay. There was a room here called “Pope’s room,” and\r\na chair was shown in which the great little man had sat. It is also\r\ncelebrated in the well-known song of Molly Mog, attributed to Gay, and\r\nprinted in Swift’s “Miscellanies.” “This cruel fair, who was daughter of\r\nJohn Mog, the landlord of that inn, died a spinster at the age of 67. Mr\r\nStanden of Arborfield, who died in 1730, is said to have been the\r\nenamoured swain to whom the song alludes. The current tradition of the\r\nplace is, that Gay and his poetic friends having met upon some occasion\r\nto dine at the Rose, and being detained within doors by the weather, it\r\nwas proposed that they should write a song, and that each person present\r\nshould contribute a verse: the subject proposed was the Fair Maid of the\r\nInn. It is said that by mistake they wrote in praise of Molly, but that\r\nin fact it was intended to apply to her sister Sally, who was the\r\ngreater beauty. A portrait of Gay still remains at the inn.”[155] The\r\nhouse at present is changed into a mercer’s shop.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Rose is combined with other objects, as the ROSE AND BALL,\r\nwhich originated in the Rose as the sign of a mercer, and the Ball as\r\nthe emblem or device which silk dealers formerly hung at their doors\r\nlike the Berlin wool shops of the present day. (_See_ under _Ball_.) The\r\nROSE AND KEY was a sign in Cheapside in 1682.[156] This combination\r\nlooks like a hieroglyphic rendering of the phrase, “under the rose,” but\r\nthe key is of very common occurrence in other signs, as will be seen\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch THISTLE AND CROWN is another not uncommon national badge,\r\nadopted mostly by publicans of North British origin. The CROWN AND HARP\r\nis less frequent; there is one at Bishop’s Cleeve, Cheltenham. Of the\r\nCROWN AND LEEK we know only one example, viz., in Dean Street, Mile\r\nEnd; but since both the rose and thistle are crowned, why not the leek\r\nalso? It is “a wholesome food,” according to Fluellen, and would no\r\ndoubt look just as well under a crown as in a Welshman’s cap. The\r\nSHAMROCK also is of common occurrence, but we have never seen it\r\ncombined with the Crown.\r\n\r\nAmong heraldic signs referring to towns are the BIBLE AND THREE CROWNS,\r\nthe coat of arms of Oxford, which was not uncommon with the booksellers\r\nin former times. To one of them, probably, belonged the carved stone\r\nspecimen walled up in a house at the corner of Little Distaff Lane and\r\nSt Paul’s Churchyard. Such a sign is also mentioned in a rather curious\r\nadvertisement in the _Postboy_, September 27, 1711:--\r\n\r\n  “THIS IS to give notice That ten Shillings over and above the Market\r\n  price will be given for the Ticket in the £1,500,000 Lottery, No. 132,\r\n  by Nath. Cliff at the Bible and Three Crowns in Cheapside.”\r\n\r\nThe _Spectator_ in his 191st number took occasion from this\r\nadvertisement to write a very amusing paper on the various lottery\r\nsuperstitions with regard to numbers.\r\n\r\nThere is also an OXFORD ARMS Inn in Warwick Lane, Newgate Street; a\r\nfine, old, galleried inn, with exterior staircases leading to the\r\nbed-rooms. This was already a carriers’ inn before the fire, as appears\r\nfrom the following advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “THESE ARE to give notice that Edward Barlet, Oxford Carrier, hath\r\n  removed his Inn in London from the Swan at Holborn Bridge, to the\r\n  Oxford Arms in Warwick Lane, where he did inne before the fire. His\r\n  coaches and waggons going forth on their usual days, Mondays,\r\n  Wednesdays, and Fridays. He hath also a hearse with all things\r\n  convenient to carry a corps to any part of England.”[157]\r\n\r\nThe BUCK IN THE PARK, Curzon Street, Derby, is the vernacular rendering\r\nof the arms of that town, which are--a hart cumbant on a mount, in a\r\npark paled, all proper. The THREE LEGS was the sign of a bookseller\r\nnamed Thomas Cockerill, over against Grocer’s Hall, in the Poultry,\r\nabout 1700. Sometimes his house is designated on his publications as the\r\nTHREE LEGS AND BIBLE. These three legs were the Manx arms. It is still a\r\nnot uncommon alehouse sign. There is one, for instance, in Call Lane,\r\nLeeds, which is known to the lower classes under the jocular\r\ndenomination of “_the kettle with three spouts_.”\r\n\r\nCounty arms also are sometimes represented on the signboards; as the\r\nFIFTEEN BALLS, (which refer to the Cornish arms, fifteen roundles\r\narranged in triangular form) at Union Street, Bodmin, Cornwall; ONE AND\r\nALL, the motto of the county of Cornwall, occurs at Cheapside, St\r\nHeliers, Jersey; and in Market Jew Street, Penzance. This motto has,\r\nbesides the advantage of being a hearty appeal to all the thirsty sons\r\nof Bacchus, and will call to the mind of a thoughtful toper, the\r\nrelative position of _one_ and _many_, or _all_, as explained by the\r\n_al-fresco_ artists, who decorate the pavement in Piccadilly--“Many can\r\nhelp one, one cannot help many.” The STAFFORDSHIRE KNOT is common in the\r\npottery districts; besides these almost every county is represented by\r\nits own arms, such as the NORTHUMBERLAND ARMS, &c., but about these\r\nnothing need be said.\r\n\r\nThe THREE BALLS of the pawnbrokers are taken from the lower part of the\r\ncoat of arms of the Dukes of Medici, from whose states, and from\r\nLombardy, nearly all the early bankers came. These capitalists also\r\nadvanced money on valuable goods, and hence gradually became\r\npawnbrokers. The arms of the Medici family were five bezants azure,\r\nwhence the balls formerly were blue, and only within the last half\r\ncentury have assumed a golden exterior, evidently to gild the pill for\r\nthose who have dealings with “my uncle;” as for the position in which\r\nthey are placed, the popular explanation is that there are two chances\r\nto one that whatever is brought there will not be redeemed.\r\n\r\nThe LION AND CASTLE, of which there are a few instances, (Cherry Garden\r\nStairs, Rotherhithe, for example,) need not be derived from royal\r\nmarriage alliances with Spain, as it may simply have been borrowed from\r\nthe brand of the Spanish arms on the sherry casks, and have been put up\r\nby the landlord to indicate the sale of genuine Spanish wines, such as\r\nsack, canary, mountain.\r\n\r\nThe FLOWER DE LUCE was a frequent English sign in old times, either\r\ntaken from the quartering of the French arms with the English, or set up\r\nas a compliment to private families who bear this charge in their arms\r\nor as crest. The preface of “Edyth, the lying widow,” ends with these\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n  “In the cyte of Exeter by West away\r\n  The time not passed hence many a day,\r\n  There dwelled a yoman discret and wise,\r\n  At the siggne of the Flower de lyse\r\n  Which had to name John Hawkyn.”\r\n\r\nTokens are extant of an inn at Dover, in the seventeenth century, with\r\nthe sign of the FRENCH ARMS, a tavern name sufficiently common also in\r\nLondon at that period to attract the travellers from across the Channel.\r\nThus James Johnson was a goldsmith, “that kept running cash,”--_i.e._, a\r\nbanker,--in Cheapside, in 1677, living at the sign of the THREE FLOWER\r\nDE LUCES.[158] In the fifteenth century, Gascon merchants and other\r\nstrangers in London were allowed to keep hostels for their countrymen,\r\nand, in order to get known, they most likely put up the arms of those\r\ncountries as their signs. No doubt the THREE FROGS, London Road,\r\nWokingham, is a travesty of _Johnny Crapaud’s Arms_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.\r\n\r\nHEDGEHOG.\r\n\r\n(Bynneman’s sign, 1560.)\r\n\r\nBLUE BOAR.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1765.)\r\n\r\nTHE VALIANT LONDON APPRENTICE.\r\n\r\n(From an old chapbook, 17th cent.)\r\n\r\nTHE SUN.\r\n\r\n(Sign of Wynkyn de Worde, 1497.)\r\n\r\nTHREE PHEASANTS AND SCEPTRE.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Bills, 1795.)]\r\n\r\nBoursault,[159] in his letter to Bizotin, has a burst of indignation at\r\na “_fournisseur_” of something or other to the royal family, who had\r\nadopted as his sign the ENGLISH ARMS, with the arms of France in the\r\nfirst quarter, and endeavours to call down the ire of the Parisian\r\npolice upon the head of the unfortunate shopkeeper who had committed\r\nthis act of treason:--\r\n\r\n  “Laissons l’Angleterre se repaître de chimères,” saith he, “et\r\n  s’imaginer que ses souverains sont Rois de France, mais que des\r\n  Français soyent assez ignorants, ou assez mauvais sujets, pour mettre\r\n  les armes de France écartelés dans celles d’Angleterre, c’est ce que\r\n  des sujets aussi zélez que Monsieur d’Argenson et les autres officiers\r\n  préposez pour la police ne doivent nullement souffrir.”[160]\r\n\r\nHe next, in a threatening manner, reminds the poor shopkeeper how,\r\naccording to “Candem [_sic_] Historien Angloys,” Queen Mary Stuart was\r\nbeheaded for having quartered the English arms with those of Scotland,\r\nthough she was the heir-presumptive of the English throne; and if such\r\nwas the fate of that queen, what then did the man deserve who quartered\r\nthe arms of his sovereign with those of a foreign king? Indeed he\r\ndeserved the same fate as the arms.\r\n\r\nAnother sign, apparently of French origin, is the DOLPHIN AND CROWN, the\r\narmorial bearing of the French Dauphin, and the sign of R. Willington, a\r\nbookseller in St Paul’s Churchyard _circa_ 1700. Some years after, this\r\nhouse seems to have been occupied by James Young, a famous maker of\r\nviolins and other musical instruments, who lived at the west corner of\r\nLondon House Yard, St Paul’s Churchyard. On this man the following\r\ncatch appeared in the _Pleasant Musicall Companion_, 1726:--\r\n\r\n  “You scrapers that want a good fiddle well strung,\r\n  You must go to the man that is old while he’s Young;\r\n  But if this same fiddle you fain would play bold,\r\n  You must go to his son, who’s Young when he’s old.\r\n  There’s old Young and young Young, both men of renown:\r\n  Old sells and young plays the best fiddle in town.\r\n  Young and old live together, and may they live long--\r\n  Young to play an old fiddle, old to sell a new song.”\r\n\r\nThis Young family afterwards removed to the QUEEN’S HEAD Tavern in\r\nPaternoster Row, where in a few years they grew rich by giving concerts,\r\nwhen they removed to the CASTLE in the same street. The Castle concerts\r\ncontinued a long time to be celebrated.\r\n\r\nMany signs are exceedingly puzzling under the name by which they pass\r\nwith the public. Such was that of “Rowland Hall, dwelling in Guttur\r\nLane, at the sygne of the HALF EAGLE AND KEY.” This quaint sign is no\r\nother than the arms of Geneva, described in the non-heraldic language of\r\nthe mob. Rowland Hall, a bookseller and printer, lived as a refugee in\r\nGeneva during the reign of Queen Mary; hence on his return to London he\r\nset up the arms of that town for his sign, as a graceful compliment to\r\nthe hospitality he had received, and as a tribute of admiration to\r\nstanch Protestantism. Hall, at other periods of his life, lived at the\r\nCRADLE in Lombard Street, and at the THREE ARROWS in Golden Lane,\r\nCripplegate. In 1769 there was again the GENEVA ARMS among the London\r\nsigns, before the shop of Le Grand, a “pastery-cook and cook,” as he\r\nstyled himself, in Church Street, Soho. Formerly most pastry-cooks and\r\nconfectioners were Swiss, and many from that country still follow those\r\nprofessions in Italy, Spain, and recently in England. This last sign has\r\nfound imitators in Soho; for at the present day it figures at a\r\npublic-house in Hayes Court, where it is put up, no doubt, in honour of\r\nthe spirit which many call Geneva, but which we may name Gin. The origin\r\nof this name, as applied by publicans, is not a little curious. In\r\nHolland the juniper-berry is used for flavouring the gin or hollands\r\nwhich they distil there, and this, with the vulgar in that country, has\r\ngradually become corrupted from Juniper to Jenever, the latter term\r\nbeing still further corrupted here to _Geneva_, and _Gin_.\r\n\r\nThe CROSS KEYS are the arms of the Papal See, the emblem of St Peter and\r\nhis successors:--\r\n\r\n  “Two massy keys he bore, of metals twain;\r\n  The golden opes, the iron shuts amaine.”\r\n\r\n  MILTON.\r\n\r\nThis sign was frequently adopted by innkeepers and other tenants of\r\nreligious houses, even after the Reformation; for the Cross Keys figure\r\nin the arms of the Bishops of York, Cashel, Exeter, Gloster, and\r\nPeterborough. At the Cross Keys in Gracechurch Street, where Tarlton,\r\nthe comic actor, went to see fashions, Banks used to perform with his\r\nwonderful bay horse before a crowded house. This was in the days of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, when the inn consisted of a large court with galleries\r\nall round, which, like many other old London inns, was often used as an\r\nextempore theatre by our ancestors. It is named in 1681[161] amongst the\r\ncarriers’ inns, and is in existence at the present day. The Cross Keys\r\nwas the sign of a tavern near Thavies Inn in 1712:--\r\n\r\n  “May the Cross Keys near Thavies Inn succeed,\r\n  And famous grow for choicest white and red;\r\n  That all may know, who view that costly sign,\r\n  Those golden keys command celestial wine.”\r\n\r\n  _The Quack Vintners. A Satire._ 1712.\r\n\r\nBesides, it is famous as the sign of Bernard Lintot, 1736, the publisher\r\nof Gay’s works, and many other popular books of that day. His shop was\r\nsituated between the Temple Gates, in Fleet Street. The CROSS KEYS AND\r\nBIBLE was the sign of J. Bell, in Cornhill, 1711.\r\n\r\nMost numerous among heraldic signs were the crests, arms, and\r\nbadges[162] of private families. The causes which dictated the\r\nchoice of such subjects were various. One of the earliest was this:--\r\n\r\n  “In towns the hospitality of the burghers was not always given gratis,\r\n  for it was a common custom even amongst the richer merchants to make a\r\n  profit by receiving guests. These letters of lodgings were\r\n  distinguished from the innkeepers or _hostelers_ by the name of\r\n  _herbergeors_, or people who gave harbour to strangers, and in large\r\n  towns they were submitted to municipal regulations. The great barons\r\n  and knights were in the custom of taking up their lodgings with those\r\n  herbergeors rather than going to the public hostel, and thus a sort of\r\n  relationship was formed between particular nobles or kings and\r\n  particular burghers, on the strength of which the latter _adopted the\r\n  arms of their habitual lodgers as their sign_.”[164]\r\n\r\nThis, again, led to the custom of prefixing to inns the arms of men of\r\nnote who had sojourned in the house, as may be seen in Machyn’s\r\nDiary:--“The xxv day of January [1560] toke ys gorney into Franse,\r\ninbassadur to the Frenche kyng, the yerle of Bedford and he had iij\r\ndozen of _logyng skochyons_,” (lodging escutcheons). Thus, on the road\r\nfrom London to Westchester the coats of arms of several of the\r\nlord-lieutenants of Ireland might formerly have been observed, either as\r\nsigns to inns or else framed and hung in the best rooms. That this was a\r\ngeneral custom with ambassadors appears from Sir Dudley Digge’s\r\n“Compleat Ambassador,” 1654; who, alluding in his preface to the reserve\r\nof English ambassadors, observes:--“We have hardly any notion of them\r\nbut their arms, which are hung up in inns where they passed.” Montaigne\r\nalso mentions this practice as usual in France:--“A Plombières il me\r\ncommanda à la faveur de son hostesse, _selon l’humeur de la nation_, de\r\nlaisser un escusson de ses armes en bois, qu’un peintre dudict lieu fist\r\npour un escu; et le fist l’hostesse curieusement _attacher à la muraille\r\npas dehors_.”[165]\r\n\r\nBut the feudal relations between the higher and lower classes\r\ncontributed above all to the adoption of this description of signs. A\r\nvassal, for instance, would set up the arms or crest of his feudal\r\nlord; a retired soldier the arms of the knight under whose banneret he\r\nhad gathered both glory and plunder; an old servant the badge he had\r\nworn when he stood at the trencher, or followed his master in the chase;\r\nand, doubtless, many publicans adopted for their sign the badge of the\r\nneighbouring wealthy noble, in order to court the custom of his\r\nhousehold and servants.\r\n\r\nBagford, in his MS. notes about the art of printing,[166] has jotted\r\ndown a list of signs originated from badges, which we will transcribe in\r\nall the unrestrained freedom of Bagford’s spelling, in which, as well as\r\nin bad writing, he surpassed all his contemporaries, (_see_ note, p.\r\n102:)--\r\n\r\n  “Then for ye original of signes used to be set over ye douers of\r\n  tradesmen, as Inkepers, Taverns, etc., thay hauing been domestic\r\n  saruants to some nobleman, thay leauing ther Masters saruis toke to\r\n  themselves for ther signes ye crest, bag,[167] or ye arms of ther Ld.,\r\n  and thes was a destincsion or Mark of one Mannes house from anouther,\r\n  and [not] only by printers but all outher trades: and these seruants\r\n  of kinges, queenes, or noblemen, being ther domestick saruants, and\r\n  wor ther Leuirs[168] and Bages, as may be sene these day ye maner of\r\n  the Leuirs and Bagges by ye wattermen:--\r\n\r\n  The ANTELOP was ye bag of Kg.

Should the estate pass into other hands,\r\nthe inn will most probably change its sign for the arms of the new\r\npurchaser. The house, as it were, wears the livery of the master,\r\nalthough, so far as heralds’ visitations are concerned, this may be as\r\nunauthorised as many other advertisements of noble descent, or gentle\r\nextraction, in use amongst the wealthy and the proud.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, as we have seen, the great landowners performed the\r\nduties of innkeepers, and their arms were hung or carved at the\r\nentrances to the castles, as indications to wayfarers who was the lord\r\nand master in those parts. The keep in those days was rarely without a\r\nstranger or two, either travelling mechanics or persons acquainted with\r\nmysteries,--as trades and professions were termed in those days,--or\r\nvagabond soldiers on the tramp for a new master to fight under. Greater\r\npeople were admitted further in the castle, but the common sort fared\r\nwith the servants. According to the good-nature of the all-powerful lord\r\nwas the fare good or bad, plentiful or meagre. It was, however,\r\ngenerally the custom in those early times to be profuse in all matters\r\nof food-bounty. The house-steward made charges for any extras, and the\r\ncomfort obtainable generally depended on the liberality or greediness of\r\nthese personages. As population increased, travellers became too\r\nnumerous for the accommodation provided. Stewards also became old, and\r\ndetached premises were given or built for them to carry on the business\r\naway from the castle or great house. The arms of the landlord were of\r\ncourse put up outside the house, and on occasion of predatory excursions\r\nor family fights, when other nobles joined their troops with those of\r\nthe landlord, the soldiers were usually quartered at the inn outside\r\nthe castle. As in all cases of public resort, people soon began to have\r\nfancies, and this Red Lion and that Greyhound became famous through the\r\ncountry for the good entertainment to be had there. In this manner Red\r\nLions and Greyhounds found their way on to the signboards of the inns\r\nwithin the walled cities. The men of the castle, too, used those houses\r\nbearing their master’s arms when they visited the town. It will be\r\nreadily seen that the name of a favourite tavern would quickly suggest\r\nits adoption elsewhere, and in this way the heraldic emblem of a family\r\nmight be carried where that family was neither known nor feared.\r\n\r\nLatterly, however, as all traces of the origin and meaning of these\r\n“Arms” have died out, or become removed from the understanding of\r\npublicans and brewers, the uses to which the word has been applied are\r\nmost absurd and ridiculous. Not only do we meet constantly with arms of\r\nfamilies nobody ever heard of, nor cares to hear about, but all sorts of\r\nimpossible “Arms” are invented, as JUNCTION ARMS, GRIFFIN’S ARMS,\r\nCHAFFCUTTER’S ARMS, UNION ARMS,[177] GENERAL’S ARMS, ANTIGALLICAN ARMS,\r\nFARMERS’ ARMS, DROVERS’ ARMS, &c., (_see_ Introduction.)\r\n\r\nIn tavern heraldry the ADAM’S ARMS ought certainly to have the\r\nprecedence: the publicans generally represent these by a pewter pot and\r\na couple of crossed tobacco pipes, differing in this from Sylvanus\r\nMorgan, a writer on heraldry, who says that Adam’s arms were “Paly\r\nTranchy divided every way and tinctured of every colour,”[178] The\r\nshield was in the shape of a spade, which was used\r\n\r\n  “When Adam delved and Eve span,”\r\n\r\nwhilst from the spindle of our first mother the female lozenge-shaped\r\nshield is said to be derived.\r\n\r\nOne of the most popular heraldic signs is the BEAR AND RAGGED STAFF, the\r\ncrest of the Warwick family:--\r\n\r\n  “_War._ Now, by my father’s badge, old Nevil’s crest,\r\n                The rampant bear chain’d to the ragged staff,\r\n                This day I’ll wear aloft my burgonet.”\r\n\r\n  _Henry VI._, Part II. a. v. s. 1.\r\n\r\nArthgal, the first Earl of Warwick, in the time of King Arthur, was\r\ncalled by the ancient British the Bear, for having strangled such an\r\nanimal in his arms; and Morvidius, another ancestor of this house, slew\r\na giant with a club made out of a young tree; hence the family bore the\r\nBear and Ragged Staff.\r\n\r\n“When Robert Dudley was governor in the Low Countries with the high\r\ntitle of his Excellencie, disusing his own coat of the Green Lion[179]\r\nwith two tails, he signed all instruments with the crest of the Bear and\r\nRagged Staff. He was then suspected by many of his jealous adversaries\r\nto hatch an ambitious design to make himself absolute commander (as the\r\nlion is king of beasts) over the Low Countries. Whereupon some--foes to\r\nhis faction and friends to the Dutch freedom--wrote under his crest set\r\nup in public places:--\r\n\r\n  ‘Ursa caret cauda, non queat esse leo.’\r\n  ‘The Bear he never can prevail\r\n  To lion it for lack of tail.’\r\n\r\nWhich gave rise to a Warwickshire proverb, in use at this day,--_The\r\nBear wants a tail and cannot be a Lion._”[180]\r\n\r\nThe Bear and Ragged Staff is still the sign of an inn at Cumnor, to\r\nwhich an historic interest is attached owing to its connexion with the\r\ndark tragedy of poor Amy Robsart, who in this very house fell a victim\r\nto that stony-hearted adventurer, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Sir\r\nWalter Scott has introduced the house in the first chapter of\r\n“Kenilworth.” The power the Warwick family once enjoyed gave this sign a\r\npopularity which has existed to the present day, though the race of old\r\nNevil, and the kings he made and unmade, have each and all passed away.\r\nIts heraldic designation has been better preserved than is the case of\r\nsome other signs; only in one instance, at Lower Bridge Street, Chester,\r\nit has been altered into the BEAR AND BILLET. Sometimes the sign of the\r\nBear and Ragged Staff, we may inform the reader, is jocularly spoken of\r\nas the Angel and Flute.\r\n\r\nThe RAGGED STAFF figures also in single blessedness. A carriers’ inn in\r\nWest Smithfield possessed this sign in 1682.[181] In the wall of a house\r\nat the corner of Little St Andrew Street and West Street, St Giles,\r\nthere is still a stone bas-relief sign of two ragged staves placed\r\nsalterwise, with the initials S. F. G., and the date 1691. It was\r\ndoubtless put there as a compliment to Robert Sydney, Earl of Leicester,\r\nwho in the reign of Charles II. built Leicester House, which gave a name\r\nto Leicester Fields, now the site of Leicester Square. Stow mentions\r\nthat the king-maker, Richard Warwick, came to town for the convention of\r\n1458, accompanied by 600 men, all in red jackets, “embroidered with\r\nragged staves before and behind.”\r\n\r\nEqually well known with the last sign is that of the EAGLE AND CHILD,\r\noccasionally called the BIRD AND BANTLING, to obtain the favourite\r\nalliteration. It represents the crest of the Stanley family, and the\r\nfollowing legend is told to account for its origin:--In the reign of\r\nEdward III., Sir Thomas Latham, ancestor of the house of Stanley and\r\nDerby, had only one legitimate child, a daughter named Isabel, but at\r\nthe same time he had an illegitimate son by a certain Mary Oscatell.\r\nThis child he ordered to be laid at the foot of a tree on which an eagle\r\nhad built its nest. Taking a walk with his lady over the estate, he\r\ncontrived to bring her past this place, pretended to find the boy, took\r\nhim home, and finally prevailed upon her to adopt him as their son. This\r\nboy was afterwards called Sir Oscatell Latham, and considered the heir\r\nto the estates. Compunction or other motive, however, made the old\r\nnobleman alter his mind and confess the fraud, and at his death the\r\ngreater part of the fortune was left to his daughter, who afterwards\r\nmarried Sir John Stanley. At the adoption of the child, Sir Thomas had\r\nassumed for crest an eagle looking backwards; this, out of ill feeling\r\ntowards Sir Oscatell, was afterwards altered into an eagle preying upon\r\na child. How matters were afterwards arranged may be seen in “Memoirs\r\ncontaining a Genealogical and Historical Account of the House of\r\nStanley,” p. 22. _Manchester_, 1767. Bishop Stanley made an historical\r\npoem upon the legend, which is not without parallel, and seems to be\r\neither a corruption of or suggested by the fable of Ganimede. Edward\r\nStanley, in his “History of Birds,” (vol. i. p. 119,) cites several\r\nsimilar stories. But the Stanley family is not the only one that bears\r\nthis crest. Randle Holme (b. iii. p. 403) gives the arms of the family\r\nof Culcheth of Culcheth as “an infant in swaddling-clothes proper,\r\nmantle gules, swaddle band or, with an eagle standing upon it, with its\r\nwings expanded sable in a field argent.” “The fause fable of the Lo.\r\nLatham” is also told at length, with slight variations from the usual\r\nstory, in a MS. in the College of Arms;[182] in this version the\r\nfoundling is made the son of an Irish king. The Eagle and Child occurs\r\nas the sign of a bookseller, Thomas Creede, in the old Exchange, as\r\nearly as 1584. Taylor the water-poet also names some instances of the\r\nsign among inns and taverns, and particularly extols one at\r\nManchester:--\r\n\r\n  “I lodged at the Eagle and the Child,\r\n  Whereas my hostesse (a good ancient woman)\r\n  Did entertain me with respect not common,\r\n  She caused my linnen, shirts, and bands be washt,\r\n  And on my way she caused me be refresht;\r\n  She gave me twelve silke points, she gave me baken,\r\n  Which by me much refused at last was taken.\r\n  In troath she proued a mother unto me,\r\n  For which I ever more will thankefull be.”[183]\r\n\r\nAnother crest of the Derby family also occurs as a sign--namely, the\r\nEAGLE’S FOOT, which was adopted in the sixteenth century by John\r\nTysdall, a bookseller at the upper end of Lombard Street.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of eagles in heraldry made them very common on the\r\nsignboard, although it is now impossible to say whose armorial bearings\r\neach particular eagle was intended to represent. The SPREAD EAGLE occurs\r\nas the sign of one of the early printers and booksellers, Gualter Lynne,\r\nwho, in the middle of the sixteenth century, had two shops with that\r\nsign,--one on Sommer’s Key, near Billingsgate, and another next St\r\nPaul’s Wharf. In 1659 there was a BLACK SPREAD EAGLE at the west end of\r\nSt Paul’s, which shop was also a bookseller’s, one Giles Calvert. As the\r\nsigns in large towns and cities were generally not altered when the\r\nhouse changed hands, it is not improbable but that this may be the same\r\nBlack Eagle mentioned by Stow in the following words:--\r\n\r\n  “During a great tempest at sea, in January 1506, Philip, King of\r\n  Castille, and his queen, were weather-driven at Falmouth. The same\r\n  tempest blew down the Eagle of brass off the spire of St Paul’s Church\r\n  in London, and in the falling the same eagle broke and battered the\r\n  Black Eagle that hung for a sign in St Paul’s Churchyard.”\r\n\r\nMilton’s father, a scrivener by trade, lived in Bread Street,\r\nCheapside, at the sign of the Spread Eagle, which was his own coat of\r\narms, and in this house the great author of “Paradise Lost” was born,\r\nDecember 9, 1608. When the poet’s fame had gone forth, strangers used to\r\ncome to see the house, until it was destroyed by the fire of 1666.\r\nPerhaps its memory is preserved in Black Spread Eagle Court, which is\r\nthe name of a passage in that locality.\r\n\r\nAnother Spread Eagle was a noted “porter-house” in the Strand at the end\r\nof the last century:--\r\n\r\n  “And to some noted porter-house repair;\r\n  The several streets or one or more can claim,\r\n  Alike in goodness and alike in fame.\r\n  The Strand her Spreading Eagle justly boasts.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Facing that street where Venus holds her reign,\r\n  And Pleasure’s daughters drag a life of pain,[184]\r\n  There the Spread Eagle, with majestic grace,\r\n  Shows his broad wings and notifies the place.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  There let me dine in plenty and in quiet.”[185]\r\n\r\nThe GRASSHOPPERS on the London signboards were all descendants of Sir\r\nThomas Gresham’s sign and crest, which is still commemorated by the\r\nweather-vane on the Royal Exchange, of which he was the first founder.\r\nThe original sign appears to have been preserved up to a very recent\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n  “The shop of the great Sir Thomas Gresham,” says Pennant, “stood in\r\n  this [Lombard] street: it is now occupied by Messrs Martin, bankers,\r\n  who are still in possession of the original sign of that illustrious\r\n  person--the Grasshopper. Were it mine, that honourable memorial of so\r\n  great a predecessor should certainly be placed in the most\r\n  ostentatious situation I could find.”[186]\r\n\r\nThe ancients used the grasshopper as a _fascinum_, (fascination,\r\nenchantment;) for this purpose Pisistratus erected one as a καταχηνη\r\nbefore the Acropolis at Athens; hence grasshoppers, in all sorts of\r\nhuman occupations, were worn about the person to bring good luck. The\r\ngrasshopper sign certainly seems to have been a lucky one. Charles\r\nDuncombe and Richard Kent, goldsmiths, lived at the Grasshopper in\r\nLombard Street, (no doubt Gresham’s old house,) in 1677,[187] and throve\r\nso well under its _fascinum_ that Duncombe gathered a fortune large\r\nenough to buy the Helmsley estate in Yorkshire from George Villiers,\r\nDuke of Buckingham. The land is now occupied by the Earl of Feversham,\r\n(Duncombe’s descendant,) under the name of Duncombe Park.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to determine whether the MAIDENHEAD was set up as a\r\ncompliment to the Duke of Buckingham, to Catherine Parr, or to the\r\nMercers’ Company, for it is the crest of the three. But at all events\r\nthe Mercers’ crest had the precedence as being the oldest. Amongst the\r\nbadges of Henry VIII. it is sometimes seen issuing out of the Tudor\r\nRose:--\r\n\r\n  “This combination,” Willement says, “does not appear to have been an\r\n  entire new fancy, but to have been composed from the rose-badge of\r\n  King Henry VIII., and from one previously used by this queen’s family.\r\n  The house of Parr had before this time assumed as one of their devices\r\n  a maiden’s head couped below the breast, vested in ermine and gold,\r\n  the hair of the head and the temples encircled with a wreath of red\r\n  and white roses; and this badge they had derived from the family of\r\n  Ros of Kendal.”\r\n\r\nIt was a sign used by some of the early printers. On the last page of a\r\nlittle work entitled “Salus Corporis, Salus Animæ,” we find the\r\nfollowing imprint:--\r\n\r\n  “Hos cme Richardus quos Fax impressit ad unguem calcographus summa\r\n  sedulitate libros.\r\n\r\n  Impressum est presens opusculum londiniis in divi pauli semiterio sub\r\n  virginei capitis signo. Anno millesimo quin getesimo nono. Mensis vero\r\n  Decembris die xii.”[188]\r\n\r\nThomas Petit, another early printer, also lived “at the sygne of the\r\nMaydenshead in Paulis Churchyard,” 1541. He was probably a successor of\r\nRichard Fax.\r\n\r\nAn amusing anecdote is told of old Hobson, the Londoner, with regard to\r\nthis sign:--\r\n\r\n  “Maister Hobson having one of his Prentices new come out of his time,\r\n  and being made a free man of London, desired to set up for himself;\r\n  so, taking a house not far from St Laurence Lane, furnished it with\r\n  store of ware, and set up the signe of the Maydenhead; hard by was a\r\n  very rich man of the same trade, had the same signe, and reported in\r\n  every place where he came, that the young man had set up the same\r\n  signe that he had onely to get away his customers, and daily vexed the\r\n  young man therewithall, who, being grieved in his mind, made it known\r\n  to Maister Hobson, his late Maister, who, comming to the rich man,\r\n  said, ‘I marvell, sir,’ (quoth Maister Hobson,) ‘why you wrong my man\r\n  so much as to say he seketh to get away your customers.’ ‘Marry, so he\r\n  doth,’ (quoth the other,) ‘for he has set up a signe called the\r\n  Maidenhead, and mine is.’ ‘That is not so,’ (replied Maister Hobson,)\r\n  ‘for his is the widdoe’s head, and no maydenhead, therefore you do him\r\n  great wrong.’ The rich man hereupon, seeing himself requited with\r\n  mocks, rested satisfied, and never after that envied Maister Hobson’s\r\n  man, but let him live quietly.”[189]\r\n\r\nThis sign occurs occasionally as the MAID’S HEAD, but since Queen\r\nElizabeth’s reign it has doubtless frequently referred to the virgin\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nTHE CROSS FOXES--_i.e._, two foxes counter saliant--is a common sign in\r\nsome parts of England. It is the sign of the principal inn at Oswestry\r\nin Shropshire, and of very many public-houses in North Wales, and has\r\nbeen adopted from the armorial bearings of Sir Watkin Williams Wynne,\r\nBart., whose family hold extensive possessions in these parts. The late\r\nbaronet, too, made himself very popular as a patron of agricultural\r\nimprovements. Old Guillim, the heraldic writer’s remarks upon this coat\r\nof arms, which he says belongs to the Kadrod Hard family of Wales, are\r\nquaint:--\r\n\r\n  “These are somewhat unlike Samson’s foxes that were tied together by\r\n  the tails, and yet these two agree in _aliquo tertio_: They came into\r\n  the field like to enemies, but they meant nothing less than fight, and\r\n  therefore they pass by each other, like two crafty lawyers, which come\r\n  to the Bar as if they meant to fall out deadly about their clients’\r\n  cause; but when they have done, and their clients’ purses are well\r\n  spunged, they are better friends than ever they were, and laugh at\r\n  those geese that will not believe them to be foxes, till they (too\r\n  late) find themselves foxbitten.”[190]\r\n\r\nThe TIGER’S HEAD was the sign of the house of Christopher and Robert\r\nBarker, Queen Elizabeth’s booksellers and printers, in Paternoster Row:\r\nit was borrowed from their crest; their shop exhibited the sign of the\r\n_Grasshopper_, in St Paul’s Churchyard. They came of an ancient family,\r\nbeing descended from Sir Christopher Barker, knight, king-at-arms, in\r\nthe reign of Henry VIII. Barker is said to have printed the first series\r\nof English news-sheets, or, as we now call them, newspapers. The\r\nearliest of those which remain (copies are preserved among Dr Birch’s\r\nHistorical Collections in the British Museum, No. 4106) relate to the\r\ndescent of the Spanish Armada upon the English coasts; but as they are\r\nnumbered 50, 51, and 54 in the corner of their upper margins, it has\r\nbeen not improbably concluded that a similar mode of publishing news had\r\nbeen resorted to considerably earlier than the date of that event,\r\nthough, as far as we know, none of the papers have been preserved. The\r\ntitle is:--\r\n\r\n  “THE ENGLISH MERCURIE, published by authoritie, for the prevention of\r\n  false reports;”\r\n\r\nand the last number contains an account of the queen’s thanksgiving at\r\nSt Paul’s for the victory she had gained over the enemies of England. It\r\nis probable that when the great alarm of the Armada had subsided, no\r\nmore numbers were published. The colophon runs:--\r\n\r\n  “Imprinted by Christopher Barker, her highnesse’s printer, July 23,\r\n  1588.”\r\n\r\nIt must not however be concealed that doubt is entertained of the\r\ngenuineness of these papers. Two of them are not of the time, but\r\nprinted in modern type; and no originals are known: the third is in\r\nmanuscript of the eighteenth century, altered and interpolated with\r\nchanges in old language, such only as an author would make.\r\n\r\nThe punning device, or printer’s emblem, of Barker was a man barking a\r\ntree, representations of which may be seen on the titles and last leaves\r\nof many of the old folio and quarto Bibles and New Testaments issued\r\nfrom his press. His descendants continued booksellers to the royal\r\nfamily until January 12, 1645, when Robert Barker, the last of the\r\nfamily, died a prisoner for debt in the King’s Bench. His misfortunes\r\nwere probably occasioned by the embarrassments of his royal master, who\r\nfor three years had been at war with the Parliament and a majority of\r\nhis subjects.\r\n\r\nVarious other booksellers sold their books under the sign of the Tiger’s\r\nHead in St Paul’s Churchyard: apparently they succeeded each other in\r\nthe same house. Thus we find Toby Cook, 1579-1590; Felix Kingston, 1599;\r\nand Henry Seile, 1634.\r\n\r\nAt Nortwich and Altringham, Chester, there is a sign called the BLEEDING\r\nWOLF, which has not been found anywhere else. Its origin is difficult to\r\nexplain, and the only explanation that can be immediately offered for it\r\nis the crest of Hugh Lupus and Richard, first and second Earls of\r\nChester, which was a wolf’s head erased; the neck of the animal being\r\n_erased_ may, by primitive sign-painters, have been represented less\r\nconventionally than is done now, and probably exhibited some of the torn\r\nparts, whence the name of the _Bleeding_ Wolf. As for the use of the\r\nterm “wolf,” instead of “wolf’s head,” we have a parallel instance in\r\none of the gates of Chester, which, from this crest, was called\r\nWolfsgate instead of Wolfshead Gate. There is another equally puzzling\r\nsign, peculiar to this county and to Lancashire--namely, the BEAR’S PAW.\r\nOf this sign, it must be confessed that no explanation can be offered;\r\nit certainly looks heraldic, and lions jambs erased are the crest of\r\nmany families.\r\n\r\nEasy enough to explain is the sign of PARTA TUERI, (Cellarhead,\r\nStaffordshire,) which is the motto of the Lilford family: this is the\r\nonly instance as yet met with of a family motto standing for a sign;\r\nthough in Essex a public-house sign, representing a sort of Bacchic coat\r\nof arms, with the motto, IN VINO VERITAS, may be seen. The OAKLEY ARMS,\r\nat Maidenhead, near Bray, deserves passing mention, on account of some\r\namusing verses _connected with the_ place. As it is frequently the\r\ncustom with publicans to choose for their sign the name or picture of\r\nsome real or imaginary hero connected with the locality in which their\r\nhouse stands, the following verses were written on the Oakley Arms, near\r\nBray:--\r\n\r\n  “Friend Isaac, ’tis strange you that live so near Bray\r\n    Should not set up the sign of the Vicar.[191]\r\n  Though it may be an odd one, you cannot but say\r\n    It must needs be a sign of good liquor.”\r\n                      Answer:\r\n  “Indeed, master Poet, your reason’s but poor,\r\n    For the Vicar would think it a sin\r\n  To stay, like a booby, and lounge at the door,--\r\n    ’Twere a sign ’twas bad liquor within.”\r\n\r\nThe WENTWORTH ARMS, Kirby Mallory, Leicestershire, may also be mentioned\r\non account of its peculiar inscription, which has a strange moral air\r\nabout it, as if a pious Boniface drew beer and uncorked wine, and wished\r\nto compromise matters on high moral grounds, and limit with puritanical\r\nrigidity the government regulation above his door, “to be Drunk on the\r\nPremises”:--\r\n\r\n  “May he who has little to spend, spend nothing in drink;\r\n  May he who has more than enough, keep it for better uses.\r\n  May he who goes in to rest never remain to riot,\r\n  And he who fears God elsewhere never forget him here.”\r\n\r\nOther heraldic animals, different from those just mentioned, belong to\r\nso many various families, that it is utterly impossible to say in honour\r\nof whom they were first set up: such, for instance, is the GRIFFIN, the\r\narmorial bearing of the Spencers, and innumerable other houses. Besides\r\nbeing an heraldic emblem, the griffin was an animal in whose existence\r\nthe early naturalists firmly believed. Its supposed eggs and claws were\r\ncarefully preserved, and are frequently mentioned in ancient inventories\r\nand lists of curiosities. “They shewed me,” [in a church at Ratisbonne,]\r\nsays Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, in one of her letters, “a prodigious\r\nclaw, set in gold, which they called the claw of a griffin; and I could\r\nnot forbear asking the reverend priest that shewed it, whether the\r\ngriffin was a saint? The question almost put him beside his gravity, but\r\nhe answered, ‘They only kept it as a curiosity.’” The supposed eggs (no\r\ndoubt ostrich eggs) were frequently made into drinking cups. The\r\nTradescants had one in their collection, kept in countenance by an egg\r\nof a dragon, two feathers of the tail of a phœnix, and the claw of a\r\nruck, “a bird able to trusse an elephant.” Sir John Mandeville gives the\r\nnatural history of the griffin, in his “Right Merveylous Travels,” chap.\r\nxxvi. From him we learn that the body of this dreadful beast was larger\r\nand stronger than “8 lions or 100 eagles,” so that he could with ease\r\nfly off to his nest with a great horse, or a couple of oxen yoked\r\ntogether, “for,” says he, “he has his talouns so large and so longe, and\r\nso gret upon his feet as thowghe thei weren hornes of grete oxen, or of\r\nbugles or of kijgn.”\r\n\r\nIn the original edition of the _Spectator_, No. xxxiii.,[192] the\r\ngriffin is mentioned as the sign of a house in Sheer Lane, Temple Bar.\r\nThe advertisement begins oddly enough:--“Lost, yesterday, _by a Lady in\r\na velvet furbelow scarf_, a watch,” &c. The GOLDEN GRIFFIN was a famous\r\ntavern in Holborn, of which there are trades tokens extant of the\r\nseventeenth century. Tom Brown talks of a “fat squab porter at the\r\nGriffin Tavern, in Fulwood’s rents,” which is the same house, as appears\r\nfrom Strype:--“At the upper end of this court is a passage into the\r\nCastle Tavern, a house of considerable trade, as is the Golden Griffin\r\nTavern, on the west side, which has a passage into Fulwood’s rents,”\r\n(Book iii., p. 253.)\r\n\r\nThe variously-coloured lions come under the same category of heraldic\r\nanimals. Amongst them the GOLDEN LION stands foremost. A public-house\r\nwith that sign in Fulham ought not to be passed unnoticed; it is one of\r\nthe most ancient houses in the village, having been built in the reign\r\nof Henry VII. The interior is not much altered; the chimney-pieces are\r\nin their original state, and in good preservation. Formerly there were\r\ntwo staircases in the thick walls, but they are now blocked up.\r\nTradition says that the house once belonged to Bishop Bonner, and that\r\nit has subterraneous passages communicating with the episcopal palace.\r\nWhen the old hostelry was pulled down in 1836, a tobacco-pipe of ancient\r\nand foreign fashion was found behind the wainscot. The stem was a\r\ncrooked bamboo, and a brass ornament of an Elizabethan pattern formed\r\nthe bowl of the pipe. This pipe Mr Crofton Croker[193] tries to identify\r\nas the property of Bishop Bonner, who, on the 15th June 1596, died\r\nsuddenly at Fulham, “while sitting in his chair and smoking tobacco.” If\r\nMr Croker be right, this inn should also have been honoured by the\r\npresence of Shakespeare, Fletcher, Henry Condell, (Shakespeare’s fellow\r\nactor,) John Norden, (author of A Description of Middlesex and\r\nHertfordshire,) Florio, the translator of Montaigne, and divers other\r\nnotabilities.\r\n\r\nThe BLUE LION is far from uncommon, and may possibly have been first put\r\nup at the marriage of James I. with Anne of Denmark. The PURPLE LION\r\noccurs but once--namely, on a trades token of Southampton Buildings.\r\n\r\nSigns borrowed from Corporation arms form the last subdivision of this\r\nchapter. Such, for instance, is the THREE COMPASSES, a change in the\r\narms of both the carpenters and masons. This sign is a particular\r\nfavourite in London, where not less than twenty-one public-houses make a\r\nliving under its shadow. Perhaps this is partly owing to the compasses\r\nbeing a masonic emblem, and a great many publicans “worthy brethren.”\r\nFrequently the sign of the compasses contains between the legs the\r\nfollowing good advice:--\r\n\r\n  “Keep within compass,\r\n    And then you’ll be sure,\r\n  To avoid many troubles\r\n    That others endure.”\r\n\r\nThree Compasses were a frequent sign with the French, German, and Dutch\r\nprinters of the sixteenth century. The Three Compasses, Grosvenor Row,\r\nPimlico, a well-known starting point for the Pimlico omnibuses, was\r\nformerly called the GOAT AND COMPASSES, for which Mr P. Cunningham\r\nsuggests the following origin:--\r\n\r\n  “At Cologne, in the church of S. Maria di Capitolio, is a flat stone\r\n  on the floor, professing to be the ‘Grabstein der Bruder und Schwester\r\n  eines Ehrbahren Wein und Fass Ampts, Anno 1693.’ That is, as I\r\n  suppose, a vault belonging to the Wine Cooper’s Company. The arms\r\n  exhibit a shield with a pair of compasses, an axe, and a dray or\r\n  truck, with goats for supporters. In a country like England, dealing\r\n  so much at one time in Rhenish wine, a more likely origin for such a\r\n  sign could hardly be imagined.”\r\n\r\nOthers have considered the sign a corruption of a puritanical phrase,\r\n“God encompasseth us.” But why may not the Goat have been the original\r\nsign, to which mine host added his masonic emblem of the compasses, a\r\npractice yet of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe GLOBE AND COMPASSES seems to have originated in the Joiners’ arms,\r\nwhich are a chevron between two pairs of compasses and a globe. It\r\noccurs, amongst other instances, as the sign of a bookseller, in the\r\nfollowing quaint title:--\r\n\r\n  “Sin discovered to be worse than a Toad; sold by Robert Walton, at the\r\n  _Globe and Compasses_, at the West end of Saint Paul’s Church.”\r\n\r\nThe THREE GOATSHEADS, a public-house on the Wandsworth Road, Lambeth,\r\nwas originally the Cordwainers’ (shoemakers) arms, which are azure, a\r\nchevron or, between three goats’ heads, erased argent. Gradually the\r\nheraldic attributes have fallen away, and the goats’ heads now alone\r\nremain. As there were rarely names under the London signs, the public\r\nunacquainted with heraldry gave a vernacular to the objects represented.\r\nThus the THREE LEOPARDS’ HEADS is given on a token as the name of a\r\nhouse in Bishopsgate; yet the token represents a chevron between three\r\nleopards’ heads, the arms of the Weavers’ Company. The sign of the\r\nLeopard’s Head was anciently called the _Lubber’s Head_. Thus in the\r\nsecond part of Henry IV., ii. 1, the hostess says that Falstaff “is\r\nindited to dinner at the Lubbar’s Head in Lumbert Street, to Master\r\nSmooth’s the silkman.” “Libbard,” _vulgo_ “lubbar,” was good old English\r\nfor “leopard.”\r\n\r\nThe GREEN MAN AND STILL is a common sign. There is one in White Cross\r\nStreet, representing a forester drinking what is there called “drops of\r\nlife” out of a glass barrel. This is a liberty taken with the\r\nDistillers’ arms, which are a fess wavy in chief, the sun in splendour,\r\nin base a still; supporters two Indians, with bows and arrows. These\r\nIndians were transformed by the painters into wild men or green men, and\r\nthe green men into foresters; and then it was said that the sign\r\noriginated from the partiality of foresters for the produce of the still\r\nThe “drops of life,” of course, are a translation of _aqua vitæ_.\r\n\r\nThe THREE TUNS were derived from the Vintners, or the Brewers’ arms. On\r\nthe 9th of May 1667, the Three Tuns in Seething Lane was the scene of a\r\nfrightful tragedy:--\r\n\r\n  “In our street,” says Pepys, “at the Three Tuns Tavern, I find a great\r\n  hubbub; and what was it but two brothers had fallen out, and one\r\n  killed the other. And who should they be but the two Fieldings. One\r\n  whereof, Bazill, was page to my Lady Sandwich, and he hath killed the\r\n  other, himself being very drunk, and so is sent to Newgate.”[194]\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been a kind of fatality attached to this sign, for\r\nthe _London Gazette_ for September 15-18, 1679, relates a murder\r\ncommitted at the Three Tuns, in Chandos Street, and in this same house,\r\nSally Pridden, _alias_ Sally Salisbury, in a fit of jealousy stabbed the\r\nHonourable John Finch in 1723. Sally was one of the handsomest “social\r\nevils” of that day, and had been nicknamed Salisbury, on account of her\r\nlikeness to the countess of that name. For her attempt on the life of\r\nFinch she was committed to Newgate, where she died the year after,\r\n“leaving behind her the character of the most notorious woman that ever\r\ninfested the hundreds of old Drury.”[195] Her portrait has been painted\r\nby Sir Godfrey Kneller.\r\n\r\nSometimes the sign of the ONE TUN may also be seen. It occurs in the\r\nfollowing newspaper item:--\r\n\r\n  “Last Thursday four highwaymen drinking at the One Tun Tavern near\r\n  Hungerford Market in the Strand, and falling out about dividing their\r\n  booty, the Drawer overheard them, sent for a constable, and secured\r\n  them, and next day they were committed to Newgate.”--_Weekly Journal_,\r\n  December 6, 1718.\r\n\r\nThat these fellows meant mischief is evident from a subsequent article.\r\nThey had a complete arsenal about them, viz., two blunderbusses, one\r\nloaded with fifteen balls, the other with seven, and five pistols loaded\r\nwith powder and shot.\r\n\r\nThe GOLDEN CUP, from the form in which it was generally represented,\r\nseems to have been derived from the Goldsmiths’ arms, which are\r\nquarterly azure, two leopards’ heads _or_, (whence the mint mark,) and\r\ntwo golden cups covered between two buckles _or_. It was a sign much\r\nfancied by booksellers, as: Abel Jeff’s in the Old Bailey, 1564; Edward\r\nAllde, Without Cripplegate, from 1587 until 1600; and John Bartlet the\r\nElder, in St Paul’s Churchyard; whilst the THREE CUPS was a famous\r\ncarriers’ inn in Aldersgate in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe RAM AND TEAZEL, Queenshead Street, Islington, is a part of the\r\nClothworkers’ arms, which are sable, a chevron ermine between two\r\nhabicks in chief _arg._, and a teasel in base _or_. The crest is a ram\r\nstatant _or_ on a mount vert.\r\n\r\nThe HAMMER AND CROWN appears from a trades token to have been the sign\r\nof a shop in Gutter Lane, in the seventeenth century. It was a charge\r\nfrom the Blacksmiths’ arms: sable, a chevron between three hammers\r\ncrowned _or_. The LION IN THE WOOD was a tavern of some note a hundred\r\nyears ago in Salisbury Court, Fleet Street. It seems originally to have\r\nbeen the Woodmongers’ arms, whose crest is a lion issuing from a wood.\r\nAt the present day it is the sign of a public-house in the same\r\nlocality, namely, in Wilderness Lane, Dorset Street, Fleet Street.\r\n\r\nTo these Corporation arms we may add two belonging to companies. During\r\nthe South Sea mania the SOUTH SEA ARMS was a favourite sign; in 1718,\r\nthe very year that Queen Anne had established the company and granted\r\nthem arms, they appeared as the sign of a tavern near Austin Friars:\r\nthey are a curious heraldic compound. “Azure, a globe representing the\r\nStraights of Magellan and Cape Horn, all proper. On a canton the arms of\r\nthe United Kingdoms of Great Britain, and in sinister chief two herrings\r\nsalterwise _arg._, crowned _or_.”\r\n\r\nThe SOL’S ARMS, Sol’s Row, Hampstead Road, immortalised by Dickens in\r\n“Bleak House,” derives its name from the Sol’s Society, who were a kind\r\nof freemasons. They used to hold their meetings at the Queen of\r\nBohemia’s Head, Drury Lane, but on the pulling down of that house the\r\nsociety was dissolved.\r\n\r\n[121] History of Musick.\r\n\r\n[122] Harl.

In our times we have seen Soyer roast a whole ox for the\r\nAgricultural Society at Exeter; the details of this culinary feat are\r\nsomewhat interesting: it was called a “baron with saddle back of beef _à\r\nla magna charta_, weighing 535 lbs., the joints being the whole length\r\nof the ox, rumps, rounds, loins, ribs, and shoulders to the neck. It was\r\nroasted in the open air within a temporary enclosure of brick work, the\r\nmonster joint steaming and frizzling away over 216 jets of gas from\r\npipes of an inch diameter, the whole being covered in with sheet iron;\r\nwhen in 5 hours the beef was dressed for 5 shillings.”--_Hints for the\r\nTable._\r\n\r\n[125] Various examples of it occur in the Banks Bills.\r\n\r\n[126] Original Weekly Journal, March 29 to April 3, 1718.\r\n\r\n[127] Banks Bills.\r\n\r\n[128] Historical and Topographical Account of the Parish of Fulham,\r\n1813, p. 271.\r\n\r\n[129] Boswell’s Johnson, vol. iv. p. 60.\r\n\r\n[130] Hawkins’s Life of Dr Johnson, p. 433.\r\n\r\n[131] This corncutter was probably the antique statue of the boy picking\r\na thorn out of his foot, and was usual with pedicures.

A curious epitaph upon\r\nher occurs in the _Weekly Oracle_, February 1, 1735; unfortunately it is\r\ntoo highly spiced to be introduced here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF ANIMALS AND MONSTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is in many cases impossible to draw a line of demarcation between\r\nsigns borrowed from the animal kingdom and those taken from heraldry: we\r\ncannot now determine, for instance, whether by the White Horse is meant\r\nsimply an _equus caballus_, or the White Horse of the Saxons, and that\r\nof the House of Hanover; nor, whether the White Greyhound represented\r\noriginally the supporter of the arms of Henry VII., or simply the\r\ngreyhound that courses “poor puss” on our meadows in the hunting-season.\r\nFor this reason this chapter has been placed as a sequel to the heraldic\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, fantastically coloured animals are unquestionably of heraldic\r\norigin: their number is limited to the Lion, the Boar, the Hart, the\r\nDog, the Cat, the Bear, and in a few instances the Bull; all other\r\nanimals were generally represented in what was meant for their natural\r\ncolours. The heraldic lions have already been treated of in the last\r\nchapter; but sometimes we meet with the lion as a _fera naturæ_,\r\nrecognisable by such names as the BROWN LION, the YELLOW LION, or simply\r\nthe Lion. There is a public-house in Philadelphia with the sign of the\r\nLion, having underneath the following lines:\r\n\r\n  “The lion roars, but do not fear,\r\n  Cakes and beer sold here.”\r\n\r\nWhich inscription is certainly as unnecessary as that over the\r\nnonformidable-looking lions under the celebrated fountain in the Spanish\r\nAlhambra, “O thou who beholdest these lions crouching, fear not, life is\r\nwanting to enable them to exhibit their fury.”\r\n\r\nLions occur in numerous combinations with other animals and objects,\r\nwhich in many cases seem simply the union of two signs, as the LION AND\r\nDOLPHIN, Market Place, Leicester; the LION AND TUN, at Congleton: the\r\nLION AND SWAN in the same locality may owe its joint title to the name\r\nof the street in which the public-house is situated, viz., Swanbank. The\r\ncombination of the LION AND PHEASANT, Wylecop, Shrewsbury, seems rather\r\nmysterious, unless the Pheasant has been substituted for the Cock, just\r\nas in the THREE PHEASANTS AND SCEPTRE, they were substituted for the\r\nTHREE PIGEONS AND SCEPTRE. As for the COCK AND LION, a very common\r\nsign, their meeting, if we may believe ancient naturalists, is anything\r\nbut agreeable to the lion.\r\n\r\n  “The lyon dreadeth the white cocke, because he breedeth a precious\r\n  stone called allectricium, like to the stone that hight Calcedonius.\r\n  And for that the Cocke beareth such a stone, the Lyon specially\r\n  abhorreth him.”[196]\r\n\r\nSome more information about this stone may be gathered from a mediæval\r\ntreatise on natural history:\r\n\r\n  “Allectorius est lapis obscuro cristallo sĩlis e vẽtriculo galli\r\n  castrati trahitur post quartũ añũ. Ultima eius quãtitas ẽ ad\r\n  magnitudinẽ fabe--quẽ gladiator. hñs in ore penanct̃. ĩvictus ac sine\r\n  siti.”[197]\r\n\r\nThe LION AND BALL owes its origin to another mediæval notion:\r\n\r\n  “Some report that those who rob the tiger of her young use a policy to\r\n  detaine their damme from following them, by casting sundry\r\n  looking-glasses in the way, whereat she useth to long to gaze, whether\r\n  it be to beholde her owne beauty or because when she seeth her shape\r\n  in the glasse she thinketh she seeth one of her young ones, and so\r\n  they escape the swiftness of her pursuit.”[198]\r\n\r\nThe looking-glass thrown to the tiger was spherical, so that she could\r\nsee her own image reduced as it rolled under her paw, and would\r\ntherefore be more likely to mistake it for her cub. Lions and tigers\r\nbeing almost synonymous in mediæval zoology, the spherical glass was\r\ngenerally represented with both. In sculpture it could only be\r\nrepresented by a ball, which afterwards became a terrestrial globe, and\r\nthe lion resting his paw upon it, passed into an emblem of royalty.\r\n\r\nIn the last century an innkeeper at Goodwood put up as his sign the\r\nCENTURION’S LION, the figure-head of the frigate _Centurion_, in which\r\nAdmiral Anson made a voyage round the world. Under it was the following\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Stay, Traveller, a while and view\r\n  One that has travelled more than you,\r\n  Quite round the Globe in each Degree,\r\n  Anson and I have plow’d the Sea;\r\n  Torrid and Frigid Zones have pass’d,\r\n  And safe ashore arriv’d at last.\r\n  In Ease and Dignity appear\r\n  He--in the House of Lords, I--here.”\r\n\r\nWhen Anson was in general disfavour about the Minorca affair, the\r\nfollowing biting reply to this inscription went the round of the\r\nnewspapers:--\r\n\r\n“_The Traveller’s reply to the Centurion’s Lion._\r\n\r\n  “O King of Beasts, what pity ’twas to sever\r\n  A pair whose Union had been just for ever!\r\n  So diff’rently advanced! ’twas surely wrong,\r\n  When you’d been fellow-travellers so long.\r\n  Had you continued with him, had he born\r\n  To see the English Lion dragg’d and torn?\r\n  Brittannia made at every vein to bleed,\r\n  A ravenous Crew of worthless Men to feed?\r\n  No; Anson once had sought the Land’s Relief;\r\n  Now--Ease and Dignity have banish’d Grief.\r\n  Go, rouse him then, to save a sinking nation,\r\n  Or call him up, the partner of your station.\r\n  We often see two Monsters for a sign,\r\n  Inviting to good Brandy, Ale, or Wine.”\r\n\r\nThe TIGER is of rare occurrence on signboards; there is a GOLDEN TIGER\r\nin Pilgrim Street, Newcastle, and a bird-fancier on Tower Dock, not far\r\nfrom the then famous menagerie which attracted crowds to the Tower,\r\nchose the LEOPARD AND TIGER for his sign. In 1665 there was a LEOPARD\r\nTavern in Chancery Lane; the same animal is still occasionally seen on\r\npublic-house signs. Generally speaking, the carnivorous animals are not\r\ngreat favourites, and those named above are almost the only examples\r\nthat occur. As for the popularity of the BEAR, it is entirely to be\r\nattributed to the old vulgar pleasure of seeing him ill-treated, a relic\r\nof the once common amusements of bear-baiting and whipping. The colours\r\nin which he is represented are the BLACK BEAR, the BROWN BEAR, the WHITE\r\nBEAR, and in a very few instances (as at Leeds) the RED BEAR.\r\n\r\nBesides bear-whipping and bear-baiting, another barbarous fancy led\r\nsometimes to the choice of this animal for a sign,--viz., the lamentable\r\npun which the publican made upon the article he sold, and the name of\r\nthe animal. Will. Rose of Coleraine, in Ireland, for instance, issued\r\ntrades tokens with a bear passant, on the reverse EXCHANGE.FOR.A.CAN\r\n(_i.e._, of Bear!), and as if the pun was not ridiculous enough, there\r\nwas a rose as a rebus for his name. Thomas Dawson of Leeds perpetrated a\r\nsimilar pun on his token, dated 1670; it says,--BEWARE.OF.Y^{E}.BEARE,\r\nevidently alluding to the strength of his beer.[199]\r\n\r\nBears used often to be represented with chains round their neck, (as on\r\nthe stone sign in Addle Street, with the date 1610.) This led to the\r\nfollowing amusing rejoinder:--It happened that a pedestrian artist had\r\nrun up a bill at a road-side inn which he was unable to pay, whereupon\r\nthe landlord, in order to settle the account, commissioned him to paint\r\na bear for his sign. The painter, wanting to make a little besides,\r\nsuggested that, if the bear was painted with a chain round his neck,\r\nwhich he strongly advised him to have, it would cost him half-a-guinea\r\nmore, on account of the gold, &c. But the host was not agreeable to this\r\nextra expense; accordingly, the sign was painted, (but in distemper,)\r\nand the painter went his way. Not many days after it began to rain, and\r\nthe bear was completely washed from the board. The first time the\r\nlandlord met the painter, he accused him in great dudgeon of having\r\nimposed upon him, for that, in less than a month, the bear had gone from\r\nhis signboard. “Now, look here,” replied the painter; “did not I advise\r\nyou to have a chain put about the bear’s neck? but you would not hear of\r\nit; had that been done he could not have run away, and would still be at\r\nyour door.”\r\n\r\nAmong the most famous Bear inns and taverns were,--the Bear “at\r\nBridgefoot,” _i.e._, at the foot of London Bridge, on the Southwark\r\nside, for many centuries one of the most popular London taverns; as\r\nearly as the reign of Richard III. we find it the resort of the\r\naristocratic pleasure-seeker. Thus, in March 1463/4, it was repeatedly\r\nvisited by Jocky of Norfolk, the then Sir John Howard, who went there to\r\ndrink wine and shoot at the target, at which he lost 20 pence.[200] It\r\nis also frequently named by the writers of the seventeenth century.[201]\r\nPepys mentions it April 3, 1667. “I hear how the king is not so well\r\npleased of this marriage between the Duke of Richmond and Mrs Stuart, as\r\nis talked; and that he by a wile did fetch her to the Bear at the\r\nBridgefoot, where a coach was ready, and they are stole away into Kent\r\nwithout the king’s leave.” The wine of this establishment did not meet\r\nwith the approbation of the fastidious searchers after claret in 1691.\r\n\r\n  “Through stinks of all sorts, both the simple and compound,\r\n  Which through narrow alleys, our senses do confound,\r\n  We came to the Bear, which we now understood\r\n  Was the first house in Southwark built after the flood;\r\n  And has such a succession of vintners known,\r\n  Not more names were e’er in Welsh pedigrees shown;\r\n  But claret with them was so much out of fashion,\r\n  That it has not been known there a whole generation.”\r\n\r\n  _Last Search after Claret in Southwark_, 1691.\r\n\r\nThis old tavern was pulled down in 1761, at the removal of the houses\r\nfrom London Bridge. “Thursday last the workmen employed in pulling down\r\nthe Bear Tavern, at the foot of London Bridge, found several pieces of\r\ngold and silver coin of Queen Elizabeth, and other money, to a\r\nconsiderable value.”--_Public Advertiser_, Dec. 26, 1761. Coins, no\r\ndoubt, dropped between the boards by the revellers of bygone\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nThere was another famous Bear Tavern at the foot of Strandbridge; the\r\nvicinity of the “Bear” and “Paris Gardens” had evidently suggested the\r\nchoice of those signs. At the Bear Tavern in the Strand, the earliest\r\nmeetings of the Society of Antiquaries took place, when there were as\r\nyet only three members, Mr Talman, Mr Bagford, and Mr Wanley. Their\r\nfirst meeting was on Friday, Nov. 5, 1707; subsequently they met at the\r\nYoung Devil Tavern in Fleet Street, and then at the Fountain, opposite\r\nChancery Lane. Mr Talman was the first president; Mr Wanley was a savant\r\nof considerable acquirements. It was he who purchased Bagford’s MS.\r\ncollection for the Harleian Library.\r\n\r\nThe WHITE BEAR at Soper’s Lane End, (now Queen Street,) Cheapside, was\r\nthe shop in which Baptist Hicks, as a silk mercer, by selling silks,\r\nvelvets, lace, and plumes to the courtiers of James I., amassed that\r\nfortune which led to the Peerage, and the title of Viscount Campden.\r\nThere was another White Bear Tavern in Thames Street, of which the sign\r\nis still extant, a stone bas-relief with the date 1670, and the initials\r\nM. E. In 1252, Henry III. received a white bear as a present from the\r\nking of Norway; and in King Edward VI.’s time, May 29, 1549, the French\r\nambassadors, after they had supped with the Duke of Somerset, went to\r\nthe Thames and saw the bear hunted in the river.[202] Such an occurrence\r\nmight easily lead to the adoption of this animal as a sign in that\r\nlocality. The following little fact connected with another White Bear\r\nInn forcibly calls up the _dark_ ages before gas was invented. In 1656,\r\nJohn Wardall gave by will to the Grocers’ Company a tenement called “The\r\nWhite Bear in Walbrook,” upon condition that they should yearly pay to\r\nthe church-wardens of St Botolph’s, Billingsgate, £4 to provide a\r\nlanthorn with a candle, so that passengers might go with more security\r\nto and from the waterside during the night. This lamp was to be fixed at\r\nthe north-east corner of the parish church of St Botolph, from St\r\nBartholomew’s-day to Lady-day; out of this sum £1 was to be paid to the\r\nsexton for taking care of the lanthorn. The annuity is now applied to a\r\nlamp lighted with gas in the place prescribed by the will.[203]\r\n\r\nThe White Bear Inn, at the east end of Piccadilly, was for more than a\r\ncentury one of the busiest coaching houses. In this house died Luke\r\nSullivan, engraver of some of Hogarth’s works; also Chatelain, another\r\nengraver, the last in such penurious circumstances, that he was buried\r\nat the expense of some friends in the poor ground of St James’s\r\nworkhouse. It was in this inn that West passed the first night in London\r\non his arrival from America. The sign of the White Bear is still common;\r\nat Springbank, Hull, there is one called, with zoological precision, the\r\nPOLAR BEAR. This may, however, refer to the constellation.\r\n\r\nThe BEAR’S HEAD occurs in Congleton, Cheshire; probably it is a family\r\ncrest, the same as the BEAR’S PAW,--both of which, it is believed, occur\r\nonly in that county and in Lancashire. The Bear is also met in frequent\r\ncombinations; one of the most common is the BEAR AND BACCHUS, which\r\nlooks like a hieroglyphic rendering of the words Beer and Wine, having\r\nthe additional attraction of alliteration. Since mythology does not\r\nmention a Beer-God, the animal was probably chosen as a rebus for the\r\ndrink. In the BEAR AND RUMMER, Mortimer Street, the rummer implies the\r\nsale of liquors, in the same manner as the Punchbowl is often used. The\r\nBEAR AND HARROW seems to be a union of two signs. In the seventeenth\r\ncentury it formed the house-decoration of an ordinary at the entrance of\r\nButcher Row, (now Picket Street, Strand.) One night in 1692, Nat Lee,\r\nthe mad poet, in going home drunk from this house, fell down in the snow\r\nand was stifled.\r\n\r\nThe Elephant, in the middle ages, was nearly always represented with the\r\ncastle on his back. For instance, in the Latin MS., Bestiarium Harl.,\r\n4751, a tower is strapped to him, in which are seen five knights in\r\nchain-armour, with swords, battle-axes, and cross-bows, their emblazoned\r\nshields hanging round the battlements; and, in the description of the\r\nanimal, it is said, “In eorum dorsis, P[er] si et Indi ligneis turribus\r\ncollocati tamquam de muro jaculis dimicant.” The rook, in Chinese\r\nchess-boards, still represents an elephant thus armed.\r\n\r\nCutlers in the last century frequently used the ELEPHANT AND CASTLE as\r\ntheir sign, on account of it being the crest of the Cutlers’ Company,\r\nwho had adopted it in reference to the ivory used in the trade. Hence\r\nthe stone bas-relief in Belle Sauvage Yard, which was the sign of some\r\nnow forgotten shopkeeper, who had chosen it out of regard to his\r\nlandlords. The houses in the yard are the property of the Cutlers’\r\nCompany. The ELEPHANT AND CASTLE public-house, Newington Butts, was\r\nformerly a famous coaching inn, but, by the introduction of railways, it\r\nhas dwindled down to a starting-point for omnibuses. The occasion of\r\nthis sign being put up was the following:--Some time about 1714, a Mr\r\nConyers, an apothecary in Fleet Street, and a great collector of\r\nantiquities, was digging in a gravel-pit in a field near the Fleet, not\r\nfar from Battle Bridge, when he discovered the skeleton of an elephant.\r\nA spear with a flint head, fixed to a shaft of goodly length, was found\r\nnear it, whence it was conjectured to have been killed by the British in\r\na fight with the Romans,[204] though now, since the late discoveries\r\nconcerning the flint implements, very different conclusions would be\r\ndrawn from this fact. But be this as it may, that elephant, whether\r\npost-tertiary or Roman, gave its name to the public-house soon after\r\nerected in that locality; and, regardless of the venerable antiquity of\r\nthis origin, it is often now-a-days jocularly degraded into the PIG AND\r\nTINDER-BOX.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by the whimsical combination of the ELEPHANT AND FISH, at\r\nSandhill, Newcastle, is hard to say, unless we assume the fish\r\noriginally to have been a dragon. Between elephants and dragons there\r\nwas supposed to be a deadly strife, and their battles are recorded by\r\nStrabo, Pliny, Ælianus, and their mediæval followers. The fight always\r\nended in the death of both, the dragon strangling the elephant in the\r\nwindings of his tail, when the elephant, falling down dead, crushed the\r\ndragon by his weight.\r\n\r\nThe ELEPHANT AND FRIAR, in Bristol, may possibly have originated from\r\nthe representation of an elephant accompanied by a man in Eastern\r\ncostume, whose flowing garment might be mistaken for the gown of a\r\nfriar. That sign would have admirably suited the fancy of the landlord\r\nof the Elephant and Castle, formerly in Leeds; his name happening to be\r\nPriest, he had the following inscription above his door:\r\n\r\n  “He is a priest who lives within,\r\n  Gives advice gratis, and administers gin.”\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, the REINDEER began to make its appearance on\r\nthe signboard, where it has kept its place to the present day. At first\r\nit was called _Rained Deer_, as we see from the newspapers of that\r\nperiod:--“Mr John Chapman, York carrier in Hull, at the sign of the\r\nRained Deer.” This led to the answer of a sailor who had made a voyage\r\nto Lapland, and on his return, being asked if he had seen any rained\r\ndeer? “No,” answered Jack, “I have seen it rain cats, dogs, and\r\npitchforks, but I never saw it rain deer.” The first instance we find of\r\nthis animal on the signboards of London, is in 1682, when there was\r\n\r\n  “Right Irish Usquebaugh to be sold at the Reindeer in Tuttle Street,\r\n  Westminster, in greater or smaller quantities, by one from\r\n  Ireland.”--_London Gazette_, Nov. 23-27, 1682.\r\n\r\nPepys mentions it as early as October 7, 1667, at Bishop Stortford, as\r\nthe sign of a tavern kept by a Mrs Elizabeth Aynsworth. Of this woman a\r\ngood story is told:--Mrs A. had been a noted procuress at Cambridge, for\r\nwhich reason she was expelled the town by the University authorities.\r\nSubsequently keeping the Reindeer at Bishop Stortford, the\r\nVice-chancellor and some of the heads of colleges, on their way to\r\nLondon, had occasion to sleep at her house, little thinking under whose\r\nroof they were. She received them nobly, served the supper up in plate,\r\nand brought forth the best wine; but, when the hour of reckoning came,\r\nwould receive no money, “for,” said she, “I am too much indebted to the\r\nVice-chancellor for expelling me from Cambridge, which has been the\r\nmeans of making my fortune.” For all this, however, she does not seem to\r\nhave mended her evil courses, for, shortly after, she was implicated in\r\nthe murder of a Captain Wood in Essex, for which one man was executed,\r\nwhilst Mrs Aynsworth was only acquitted by some flaw in the evidence.\r\n\r\nDRAGONS, when apothecaries’ signs, were not derived from heraldry, but\r\nwere used to typify certain chemical actions. In an old German work on\r\nAlchemy,[205] one of the plates represents a dragon eating his own tail;\r\nunderneath are the words,--\r\n\r\n  “Das ist gros Wunder und seltsam List,\r\n  Die höchst Artzney im Drachen ist.”[206]\r\n\r\nIn mediæval alchemy, the dragon seems to have been the emblem of\r\nMercury, which appears from these words on the same print: “Mercurius\r\nrecte et chymice præcipitatus vel sublimatus in sua propria aqua\r\nresolutus et rursum coagulatus.”[207] To which are added the following\r\nrhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “Ein Drach im Walde wohnend ist,\r\n  An Gifft demselben nichts gebrisst;\r\n  Wenn er die Sonne sieht und das Fewr\r\n  So speusst er Gifft fleugt ungehewr,\r\n  Kein Lebend Thier für ihm mag gnesn\r\n  Der Basilisc mag ihm nit gleich wesn.\r\n  Wer diesen Wurmb wol weiss zu tödtn\r\n  Der kömpt auss allen seinen Nöthen.\r\n  Sein Farber in seinem Todt sich vermehrn;\r\n  Auss seiner Gifft Artzney thut werden.\r\n  Sein Gifft verzehrt er gar und gans\r\n  Und frisst sein eign vergiften Schwantz.\r\n  Da mus er in sich selbst volbringen\r\n  Der edelst Balsam auss ihm thut tringen,\r\n  Solch grosse Tugend wird man schawen\r\n  Welches alle Weysn sich hoch erfrawen.”[208]\r\n\r\nHence the dragon became one of the “properties” of the chemist and\r\napothecary, was painted on his drug-pots, hung up as his sign, and some\r\ndusty, stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling in the laboratory had\r\nto do service for the monster, and inspire the vulgar with a profound\r\nawe for the mighty man who had conquered the vicious reptile.\r\n\r\nThe SALAMANDER was another animal of the same class, and also\r\nrepresented certain chemical actions, owing to its fabled powers of\r\nresisting the fire. The notions of early naturalists concerning this\r\ncreature were very extraordinary. A Bestiarium in the Royal Library of\r\nBrussels, No. 10074, says that it lives on pure fire, and produces a\r\nsubstance which is neither silk nor linen, nor yet wool, of which\r\ngarments are made that can only be cleaned by fire; and that if the\r\nanimal itself falls into a burning fire, it would at once extinguish the\r\nflames. Bossewell, besides incombustibility, attributes to the\r\nsalamander some other qualities fully as extravagant.\r\n\r\n  “Among all venomenous beastes he is the mightiest of poyson and\r\n  venyme. For if he creepe upon a tree, he infecteth all the apples or\r\n  other fruit that groweth thereon with his poyson, and killeth them\r\n  which eate thereof. Which apples, also, if they happen to falle into\r\n  any pitte of water, the strength of the poyson killeth them that\r\n  drinke thereof.”[209]\r\n\r\nThis incombustibility made it a very proper sign for alchemists and\r\napothecaries, and with the last it still continues as such, at least on\r\nthe Continent. Why the early Venetian printers adopted it as a sign is\r\nless evident. In France it was certainly a favourite sign with this\r\nclass of workmen; but this was from the fact of its having been the\r\nbadge of Francis I., a liberal patron of the arts and sciences.\r\n\r\nThe qualities attributed to the UNICORN caused this animal to be used as\r\na sign both by chemists and goldsmiths. It was believed that the only\r\nway to capture it was to leave a handsome young virgin in one of the\r\nplaces where it resorted. As soon as the animal had perceived her, he\r\nwould come and lie quietly down beside her, resting his head in her lap,\r\nand fall asleep, in which state he might be surprised by the hunters who\r\nwatched for him. This laying his head in the lap of a virgin made the\r\nfirst Christians choose the unicorn as the type of Christ born from the\r\nVirgin Mary.[210] The horn, as an antidote to all poison, was also\r\nbelieved to be emblematic of the conquering or destruction of sin by the\r\nMessiah. Religious emblems being in great favour with the early\r\nprinters, some of them for this reason adopted the unicorn as their\r\nsign; thus John Harrison lived at the UNICORN AND BIBLE in Paternoster\r\nRow 1603. Again, the reputed power of the horn caused the animal to be\r\ntaken as a supporter for the apothecaries’ arms, and as a constant\r\nsignboard by chemists. Albertus Magnus says:--“Cornu cerastis sunt qui\r\ndicunt præsenti veneno sudare et ideo ferri ad mensas nobilium, et fieri\r\ninde manubria cultellorum quæ infixa mensis prodant presens venenum.\r\nSed hoc non satis probatum est.”[211] Whatever it was that passed for\r\nunicorn’s horn, (probably the horn of the narwal,) it was sold at an\r\nimmense price. “The unicorn whose horn is worth a city,” says Decker in\r\nhis Gull’s Hornbook; and Andrea Racci, a Florentine physician, relates\r\nthat it had been sold by the apothecaries at £24 per ounce, when the\r\ncurrent value of the same quantity of gold was only £2, 3s. 6d. In a MS.\r\ntable of customs entitled, “The Book of Rates in y^{e} first yeare of\r\nQueen Mary 1531,”[212] we find the duty paid upon “cornu unicorn y^{e}\r\nounce 20s.” An Italian author who visited England in the reign of Henry\r\nVII.,[213] speaking of the immense wealth of the religious houses in\r\nthis country says:--“And I have been informed that, amongst other\r\nthings, many of these monasteries possess unicorns’ horns of an\r\nextraordinary size.” Hence such a horn was fit to be placed among the\r\nroyal jewels, and there it appears at the head of an inventory taken in\r\nthe first year of Queen Elizabeth, and preserved in Pepys’s\r\nlibrary.[214] “Imprimis, a piece of unicorn’s horn,” which, as the most\r\nvaluable object, is named first.\r\n\r\nThis was no doubt the piece seen by the German traveller Hentzner, at\r\nWindsor: “We were shown here, among other things, the horn of a unicorn\r\nof above eight spans and a half in length, valued at above\r\n£10,000.”[215] Peacham places “that horne of Windsor (of an unicorne\r\nvery likely)”[216] amongst the sights worth seeing. Fuller also speaks\r\nof a unicorn’s horn--“in my memory shewn to people in the\r\nTower”[217]--and enters on a long dissertation about its virtues; but it\r\nseems to have been lost, or at least, no longer exhibited in his time.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the efficacy and value of this horn continued to the close\r\nof the seventeenth century; for the Rev. John Ward in his diary, p. 172,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  “Mr Hartman had a piece of unicorn’s horn, which one Mr Godeski gave\r\n  him; hee had itt att some foraine prince’s court. I had the piece in\r\n  my hand. Hee desired Dr Willis to make use of itt in curing his ague;\r\n  but the Dr refusd because hee had never seen itt used. Mr Hartman told\r\n  me the forementioned gentleman has as much of itt as would make a cup,\r\n  and he intended to make one of itt. It approved ittself as a true one,\r\n  as he said by this: if one drew a circle with itt about a spider, she\r\n  would not move out off itt.”[218]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\nTWO SPIES.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1730.)\r\n\r\nTHREE NEATS’ TONGUES.\r\n\r\n(Harleian Collection, 1708.)\r\n\r\nMAN IN THE MOON.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1760.)\r\n\r\nBULL AND MOUTH.\r\n\r\n(St Martin’s-le-Grand, 1835.)\r\n\r\nBULL AND MOUTH.\r\n\r\n(Angel St., St Martin’s-le-Grand, circa 1800.)]\r\n\r\nThe great value set upon unicorns’ horn caused the goldsmiths to adopt\r\nthis animal as their sign. There is one recorded in Machyn’s Diary: the\r\nfirst of May 1561, “at afternone dyd Mastyr Godderyke’s sune the\r\ngoldsmyth go hup into hys father’s gyldyng house, toke a bowe-strynge,\r\nand hanged ymseylff at the syne of the Unycorne in Chepesyd.” In 1711\r\nthe UNICORN AND DIAL was the sign of a watchmaker near the Strand\r\nBridge.[219]\r\n\r\nAnother fabulous animal that formerly (though rarely) occurred on\r\nsignboards was the COCKATRICE, which was the sign of a place of\r\namusement in Highbury _circa_ 1611. The “Bestiaria,” or ancient natural\r\nhistories, give most extraordinary particulars about the birth of this\r\ncreature:--\r\n\r\n  “When the cock is past seven years old an egg grows in his belly, and\r\n  when he feels this egg, he wonders very much, and sustains the\r\n  greatest anxiety any animal can suffer. He seeks, privately, a warm\r\n  place on a dunghill or in a stable, and scratches with his feet, until\r\n  he has formed a hole to lay his egg in. And when the cock has dug his\r\n  hole he goes ten times a day to it, for all day he thinks that he is\r\n  going to be delivered. And the nature of the toad is such that it\r\n  smells the venom which the cock carries in his belly, consequently it\r\n  watches him, so that the cock cannot go to the hole without being seen\r\n  by it. And as soon as the cock leaves the place where he has to lay\r\n  his egg, the toad is immediately there to see if the egg has been\r\n  laid; for his nature is such, that he hatches the egg if he can obtain\r\n  it. And when he has hatched it, until it is time to open, it produces\r\n  an animal that has the head, and neck, and breast of a cock, and from\r\n  thence downwards, the body of a serpent.”--_Translation from the MS.\r\n  Bestiarium_, Bib. Roy. Brussels, No. 10074.\r\n\r\nThat cocks, sometimes in the middle ages, forgot themselves so far as to\r\nlay eggs, appears from a lawsuit which poor chanticleer had at Basle in\r\n1474, when he was convicted, condemned, and, with his egg, burned at the\r\nstake for a sorcerer, with as much pomp and ceremony as if he had been a\r\nProtestant or other heretic.\r\n\r\nThe APE was, in bygone times, the sign of an inn in Philip Lane, near\r\nLondon wall; all that now remains of this ancient hostelry is a stone\r\ncarving of a monkey squatted on its haunches, and eating an apple; under\r\nit the date 1670, and the initial B. The courtyard, where the lumbering\r\ncoaches used to arrive and depart, is now an open space, round which\r\nhouses are built. The RACOON is a painted sign at Dalston, but a hyæna\r\nseems to have sat for the portrait; the HIPPOPOTAMUS occurs in\r\nNew-England Street, Brighton; the IBEX at Chadelworth, Wantage; the\r\nCROCODILE in Higham Street, Norwich; the CAMEL may be met with in a few\r\ninstances, and at Weston Peverell, Plymouth, there is the sign of the\r\nCAMEL’S HEAD. Finally, there is the KANGAROO, of which, occasionally, an\r\nexample may be seen, set up probably by some landlord who had tried his\r\nluck in Australia. The CIVET is common all over Europe as a perfumer’s\r\nsign, as it was said to produce musk. A Dutch perfumer in the\r\nseventeenth century wrote under his sign:--\r\n\r\n  “Dit ’s in de Civet kat, gelyk gy kunt aanschouwen,\r\n  Maar komt hier binnen, hier zyn parfuimen voor mannen en\r\n  vrouwen.”[220]\r\n\r\nThe HEDGEHOG was never very common. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth it\r\nwas the sign of William Seeres, bookseller, in St Paul’s Churchyard, who\r\nput it up, according to Bagford, on account of its being the badge of\r\nhis former master Sir Henry Sydney.[221] Apparently this same house was\r\nconcerned in the following strange affair:--\r\n\r\n  “By a lettere dated London, 11 May 1555, it appears that in Powles\r\n  Churchyearde at the sign of the Hedgehog, the goodwife of the house\r\n  was brought to bed of a manchild, being of the age of 6 dayes and\r\n  dienge the 7^{th} daye followinge; and half an hour before it departed\r\n  spake these words followinge: (rise and pray) and so continued half an\r\n  houre in thes words and then cryinge departed the worlde. Hereupon the\r\n  Bishope of London examined the goodman of the house and other credible\r\n  persones who affirmed it to be true and will dye uppon the same.”[222]\r\n\r\nThe Hedgehog is now very scarce on signboards; at Dadlington, near\r\nMarket Bosworth, there is a DOG AND HEDGEHOG, doubtless borrowed from\r\nthe well-known engraving of “A Rough Customer.”\r\n\r\nSigns relating to sport or the chase are comparatively common; thus we\r\nhave the RAT AND FERRET at Wilson, near Ashby de la Zouch; the THREE\r\nCONIES, or rabbits, figure on an old trades token of Blackman Street;\r\nthe HARE, on the token of John Perris in the Strand, 1666; and Nicholas\r\n_Warren_, in Aldersgate.[223] Warren evidently made a cockney mistake,\r\nthinking that hares, instead of rabbits, lived in _warrens_. Another\r\nHare was the sign of Philip Hause in Walbrook in 1682.[224] The HARE AND\r\nSQUIRREL occur together on a sign at Nuneaton; what the combination\r\nmeans it is difficult to surmise.\r\n\r\n  “Cages with climbing SQUIRRELS and bells to them were formerly the\r\n  indispensable appendages of the outside of a Tinman’s shop, and were,\r\n  in fact, the only live sign. One, we believe, still (1826) hangs out\r\n  on Holborn; but they are fast vanishing with the good old modes of our\r\n  ancestors.”[225]\r\n\r\nThe THREE SQUIRRELS was the sign of an inn at Lambeth, mentioned by\r\nTaylor the Water poet in 1636; and from a trades token it appears that\r\nin the seventeenth century there was a similar sign in Fleet Street.\r\nProbably it was the same house which, in 1673/4, was occupied by Gosling\r\nthe banker, “over against St Dunstan’s Church,” where the triad of\r\nsquirrels may still be seen in the iron-work of the windows. Gosling’s\r\nwas one of the leading banking establishments in the reign of Charles\r\nII. Among the curiosities of this old firm is a bill for £640, 8s., paid\r\nout of the secret service money for gold lace and silver lace, bought by\r\nthe Duchess of Cleveland for the wedding clothes of the Lady Sussex and\r\nLitchfield.\r\n\r\nThe HARE AND HOUNDS are very common; some fifty years ago it was the\r\nsign of a notorious establishment in St Giles’s, one of those places\r\nassociated with “the good old customs of our ancestors.” As the few\r\nhouses of this character that remain are difficult of access, a\r\ndescription of this place may not be uninteresting.\r\n\r\n  “The Hare and Hounds was to be reached by those going from the west\r\n  end towards the city, by going up a turning on the left hand, nearly\r\n  opposite St Giles’s churchyard. The entrance to this turning or lane\r\n  was obstructed or defended by posts with cross bars, which being\r\n  passed, the lane itself was entered. It extended some twenty or thirty\r\n  yards towards the north, through two rows of the most filthy,\r\n  dilapidated, and execrable buildings that could be imagined; and at\r\n  the top or end of it stood the citadel, of which ’Stunning Joe’ was\r\n  the corpulent castellan;--I need not say that it required some\r\n  determination and some address to gain this strange place of\r\n  rendezvous. Those who had the honour of an introduction to the great\r\n  man were considered safe, wherever his authority extended, and in\r\n  this locality it was certainly very extensive. He occasionally\r\n  condescended to act as a pilot through the navigation of the alley to\r\n  persons of aristocratic or wealthy pretensions, whom curiosity, or\r\n  some other motive best known to themselves, led to his abode. Those\r\n  who were not under his safe conduct frequently found it very unsafe to\r\n  wander in the intricacies of this region. In the _salon_ of this\r\n  temple of low debauchery were assembled groups of all ‘unutterable\r\n  things,’ all that class distinguished in those days, and, I believe,\r\n  in these, by the generic term ‘cadgers.’\r\n\r\n  Hail cadgers, who in rags array’d,\r\n  Disport and play fantastic pranks;\r\n  Each Wednesday night in full parade,\r\n  Within the domicile of Bank’s.\r\n\r\n  A ‘lady’ presided over the revels, collected largess in a platter,\r\n  and, at intervals, amused the company with specimens of her vocal\r\n  talent. Dancing was ‘kept up till a late hour,’ with more vigour than\r\n  elegance, and many terpsichorean passages, which partook rather of the\r\n  animation of the ‘Nautch’ than the dignity of the minuet, increased\r\n  the interest of the performance. It may be supposed that those who\r\n  assembled were not the sort of people who would have patronised Father\r\n  Matthew had he visited St Giles’s in those times. There was indeed an\r\n  almost incessant complaint of drought, which seemed to be increased by\r\n  the very remedies applied for its cure; and had it not been for the\r\n  despotic authority with which the dispenser of the good things of the\r\n  establishment exercised his rule, his liberality in the dispensation\r\n  would certainly have led to very vigorous developments of the\r\n  reprobation of man and of woman also. In the lower tier, or cellars,\r\n  or crypt of the edifice, beds or berths were provided for the company,\r\n  who, packed in bins after the ‘fitful fever’ of the evening, slept\r\n  well.”[226]\r\n\r\nIn 1750 there was a sign of the HARE AND CATS at Norwich,[227] which was\r\nclearly a travesty of the Hare and Hounds.\r\n\r\nThe STAG may in early times have been put up as a religious type. As\r\nsuch it is of constant occurrence in the catacombs and in early\r\nChristian sculptures, in allusion to Psalm xlii., “Like as the hart\r\ndesireth the water brook, so longeth my soul after thee, O God!”[228]\r\nThe Stag is still a very common sign. A publican on the Fulham Road has\r\nput up the sign of the Stag, and added to this on the tympanum: “Rex in\r\nregno suo non habet parem,” the application of which is best known to\r\nmine host himself.\r\n\r\nThe BALDFACED STAG is seen in many places: baldfaced is a term applied\r\nto horses who have a white strip down the forehead to the nose. At\r\nChigwell in Essex there is a BALD HIND, and in the High Street,\r\nReading, a BALD FACE, both evidently derived from the last-named stag.\r\n\r\nVarious combinations also occur, as the STAG AND CASTLE, at Thornton,\r\nnear Hinckly; the STAG AND PHEASANT, rather common; both these,\r\ndoubtless, allude to the game seen in parks, or in the neighbourhood of\r\nnoblemen’s seats; the STAG AND OAK, the Cape, Warwickshire, points\r\ntowards a similar origin, but the STAG AND THORN at Traffick Street,\r\nDerby, seems to be a union of two signs, for the THORN appears in the\r\nsame street on another public-house. There is, however, a sort of tree\r\ncalled the Buck-Thorn, which possibly may have been corrupted into the\r\nBuck and Thorn, and hence the Stag and Thorn. The RISING DEER\r\n(Brampton-en-le-Morthen, Yorkshire) and the RISING BUCK (Sheinton,\r\nShropshire) have a decided deer-stalking smack about them, affording us\r\na glimpse of the cautious stag rising from the heather, pricking his\r\nears and sniffing the wind.\r\n\r\nThe RANGED DEER was the sign of the King’s gunsmith in the Minories,\r\n1673.[229] At that period this street was full of smiths:\r\n\r\n  “The Mulcibers who in the Minories sweat\r\n  And massive bars on stubborn anvils beat,\r\n  Deform’d themselves, yet forge those stays of steel\r\n  Which arm Aurelia with a shape to kill.”--_Congreve._\r\n\r\nThis ranged deer was simply intended for the Reindeer, which animal had\r\nthen just newly come under the notice of the public; their knowledge of\r\nit was still confused, and its name was spelled in various ways, such\r\nas: _rain-deer_, _rained-deer_, _range-deer_, and _ranged-deer_.\r\n\r\nTHE ROEBUCK is equally common with the Stag; the GOLDEN BUCK, near St\r\nDunstan, was the shop of P. Overton, publisher of “The Cries of the City\r\nof London, consisting of 74 copper-prints, each figure drawn after the\r\nlife, by the famous Mr Laron.” The BUCK AND BELL is a sign at Long\r\nItchington: the bell was frequently added to the signs of public-houses\r\nin honour of the bell-ringers, who were in the habit of refreshing\r\nthemselves there. Hence we have the BULL AND BELL, Briggate, Leeds; the\r\nRAVEN AND BELL, at Shrewsbury, Wolverhampton, and Newport; the BELL AND\r\nTALBOT, at Bridgenorth; the DOLPHIN AND BELL on the token of John\r\nWarner, Aldersgate, 1668; the FISH AND BELL, (evidently the same sign,)\r\nCharles Street, Soho; the THREE SWANS AND PEAL at Walsall; the NELSON\r\nAND PEAL, and many others.\r\n\r\nAmong the taverns with the sign of the ROEBUCK that have become famous,\r\nthe house in Cheapside may be mentioned as a notorious place during the\r\nWhig riots in 1715.\r\n\r\nNot only the Deer tribe themselves, but their HORNS also make a\r\nconsiderable figure on the signboard. It is probably to the sign of the\r\nHorns that allusion is made in the roll of the Pardoner, “Cocke Lorells\r\nBote:”--\r\n\r\n  “Here is Maryone Marchauntes at Allgate\r\n  Her Husbõde dwells at ye siggne of _ye Cokeldes Pate_.”\r\n\r\nThe HORNS was a tavern of note in Fleet Street in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth:\r\n\r\n  “The xvj day of September (1557), cam owt of Spayn to the Quens Cowrt\r\n  in post Monser Regamus, gorgysly apparelled, with divers Spaneardes,\r\n  and with grett cheynes, and their hats sett with stones and perlles,\r\n  and sopyd [supped], and by vij of the cloke were again on horsẽbake,\r\n  and so thrugh Flet Strett, and at the HORNES they dronke, and at the\r\n  GRAYHONDE, and so thrugh Chepesyde, and so over the bryge, and so rod\r\n  all nyght toward Dover.”--_Machyn’s Diary._\r\n\r\nSometimes the Horns are specified as the HART’S HORNS Inn, Smithfield,\r\nnear Pie Corner, one of the houses in the yard of which Joe Miller used\r\nto play during Bartholomew Fair time, when he was associated with\r\nPinkethman at the head of a troop of actors. The _London Daily Post_ for\r\nAugust 24, &c., 1721, contains several advertisements of his troop, and\r\nthe parts played by himself.\r\n\r\nWhat most contributed to the popularity of this sign in the environs of\r\nLondon was the custom alluded to by Byron:\r\n\r\n    “And many to the steep of Highgate hie,\r\n    Ask ye, Bœotian shades! the reason why,\r\n    ’Tis to the worship of the solemn horn,\r\n    Grasp’d in the holy hand of mystery,\r\n    In whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,\r\n  And consecrate the oath with draught and dance till morn.”[230]\r\n\r\nHighgate was the headquarters for this swearing on the horn. Hone gives\r\nthe oath in the following form:--\r\n\r\n  “An old and respectable inhabitant of the village says, that 60 years\r\n  ago, upwards of 80 stages stopped every day at the Red Lion, and that\r\n  out of every 5 passengers 3 were sworn. The oath was delivered\r\n  standing, and ran thus: ‘_Take notice_ what I now say unto you, for\r\n  _that_ is the first word of your oath--mind _that_! You must\r\n  acknowledge me to be your adopted father, I must acknowledge you to be\r\n  my adopted son (or daughter). If you do not call me father, you\r\n  forfeit a bottle of wine. If I do not call you son, I forfeit the\r\n  same. And now, my good son, if you are travelling through this village\r\n  of Highgate, and you have no money in your pocket, go call for a\r\n  bottle of wine at any house you think proper to go into, and book it\r\n  to your father’s score. If you have any friends with you you may treat\r\n  them as well, but if you have money of your own you must pay for it\r\n  yourself. For you must not say you have no money when you have,\r\n  neither must you convey the money out of your own pockets into your\r\n  friends’ pockets, for I shall search you as well as them; and if it is\r\n  found that you or they have money, you forfeit a bottle of wine for\r\n  trying to cozen and cheat your poor old ancient father. You must not\r\n  eat brown bread while you can get white, except you like the brown the\r\n  best; you must not drink small beer while you can get strong, except\r\n  you like the small the best. You must not kiss the maid while you can\r\n  kiss the mistress, except you like the maid the best, but sooner than\r\n  lose a good chance you may kiss them both. And now, my good son, for a\r\n  word or two of advice: keep from all houses of ill repute, and every\r\n  place of public resort for bad company. Beware of false friends, for\r\n  they will turn to be your foes, and inveigle you into houses where you\r\n  may lose your money and get no redress. Keep from thieves of every\r\n  denomination. And now, my good son, I wish you a safe journey through\r\n  Highgate and this life. I charge you, my good son, that if you know\r\n  any in this company who have not taken the oath you must cause them to\r\n  take it, or make each of them forfeit a bottle of wine, for if you\r\n  fail to do so you will forfeit a bottle of wine yourself. So now my\r\n  good son, God bless you. Kiss the horns or a pretty girl, if you see\r\n  one here which you like best, and so be free of Highgate.’”\r\n\r\nAfter that, the new-made member became fully acquainted with the\r\nprivileges of a freeman, which consisted in:\r\n\r\n  “If at any time you are going through Highgate, and want to rest\r\n  yourself, and you see a pig lying in the ditch, you have liberty to\r\n  kick her out and take her place; but if you see three lying together,\r\n  you must only kick out the middle one and lie between the other two.”\r\n\r\nThese last liberties, however, are a later addition to the oath\r\nintroduced by a blacksmith, who kept the COACH AND HORSES. Nearly every\r\ninn in Highgate used to keep a pair of horns for this custom. In Hone’s\r\ntime the principal inn, the Gatehouse, had stag-horns:--\r\n\r\n  The Mitre, stags’-horns.\r\n  The Green Dragon, do.\r\n  The Red Lion and Sun, bullocks’-horns.\r\n  The Bell, stags’-horns.\r\n  The Coach and Horses, rams’-horns.\r\n  The Castle, do.\r\n  The Red-Lion, rams’-horns.\r\n  The Coopers’ Arms, do.\r\n  The Fox and Hounds, rams’-horns.\r\n  The Flask, do.\r\n  The Rose and Crown, stags’-horns.\r\n  The Angel, rams’-horns.\r\n  The Bull, stags’-horns.\r\n  The Wrestlers, do.\r\n  The Lord Nelson, do.\r\n  The Duke of Wellington, stags’-horns.\r\n  The Crowne, do.\r\n  The Duke’s Head, do.\r\n\r\nHone supposes the custom to have originated in a sort of graziers’\r\nclub.[231] Highgate being the place nearest London where cattle rested\r\non their way from the north, certain graziers were accustomed to put up\r\nat the Gatehouse for the night. But as they could not wholly exclude\r\nstrangers who, like themselves, were travelling on business, they\r\nbrought an ox to the door, and those who did not choose to kiss its\r\nhorns, after going through the ceremony described, were not deemed fit\r\nmembers of their society. Similar customs prevailed in other places, as\r\nat Ware, at the Griffin in Hoddesdon, &c.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent the sign of the Horns was formerly equally common,\r\noften accompanied with some sly allusion to what Othello calls “the\r\nforked plague.” Thus in the Rue Bourg Chavin, in Lyons, there is now a\r\npair of horns with the inscription “SUNT SIMILIA TUIS;” and a Dutch\r\nshopkeeper of the seventeenth century wrote under his sign of the\r\nHorns--\r\n\r\n  “Ik draag Hoornen dat ider ziet,\r\n  Maar menig draagt Hoornen en weet het niet.”[232]\r\n\r\nThe Fox, as might be expected, is to be seen in a great many places;\r\nthere is one at Frandley, Cheshire, with the following rhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “Behold the Fox, near Frandley stocks,\r\n  Pray catch him when you can,\r\n  For they sell here, good ale and beer,\r\n  To any honest man.”\r\n\r\nA still more absurd inscription accompanies the sign of the Fox at\r\nFolkesworth, near Stilton, Hunts:--\r\n\r\n  “I . HAM . A . CUNEN . FOX\r\n  YOU . SEE . THER . HIS .\r\n  NO . HARM . ATCHED .\r\n  TO . ME . IT . IS . MY . MRS\r\n  WISH . TO . PLACE . ME\r\n  HERE . TO . LET . YOU . NO .\r\n  HE . SELLS . GOOD . BEERE .”\r\n\r\nFormerly there used to be a sign of the THREE FOXES in Clement’s Lane,\r\nLombard Street, carved in stone, representing three foxes sitting in a\r\nrow. But a few years ago the house came into the possession of a legal\r\nfirm, who, no doubt afraid of the jokes to which the sign might lead,\r\nthought it advisable to do away with the carving by covering it over\r\nwith plaster.\r\n\r\nOne of the most favourite combinations is the FOX AND GOOSE, represented\r\nby a fox currant, with the neck of the goose in his mouth and the body\r\ncast over his back. It seems suggested by an incident in the old tale\r\nof “Reynard the Fox,” and was a subject which mediæval artists were\r\nnever tired of representing; it occurs in stall carvings, as in\r\nGloucester Cathedral; in the border of the Bayeux tapestry, and in\r\nendless MS. illuminations. It is, or was, a coat of arms borne by the\r\nfamilies of Foxwist and Foxfeld. Derived from this sign are the FOX AND\r\nDUCK, (two in Sheffield,) and the FOX AND HEN, of which there is an\r\nexample at Long Itchington. Reynard’s predatory habits are further\r\nillustrated by the FOX AND LAMB, in Pilgrim Street, Newcastle, in\r\nAllendale, &c., and the FOX AND GRAPES, borrowed from the fable. From\r\nthe same well-known source also arose the sign of the FOX AND CRANE. But\r\nwe see the punishment of all Reynard’s misdemeanours in the FOX AND\r\nHOUNDS, a sign of old standing, as there is one in Putney on a house\r\nwhich professes to have been “established above three hundred years.”\r\nThe FOX AND OWL at Nottingham, seems to owe its origin to a curious _qui\r\npro quo_ in language. A bunch of ivy, or ivy tod, was generally\r\nconsidered the favourite haunt of an _owl_; but a _tod_ also signifies a\r\nfox; and so the owl’s nest, owls-tod, may have led to the owl and tod,\r\nthe fox and owl. The OWL’S NEST is still a sign at St Helen’s,\r\nLancashire. _See under_ Bird Signs.\r\n\r\nIn the sign of the FOX AND BULL, at Knightsbridge, the bull has been\r\nadded of late years. About fifty years ago a magistrate used to sit once\r\na week at this public-house to settle the small disputes of the\r\nneighbouring inhabitants. At that period Knightsbridge was still in such\r\na benighted condition that neither a butcher’s nor draper’s shop was to\r\nbe found between Hyde Park Corner and Sloane Street; and the whole\r\nlocality could only boast of one stationer where note-paper and\r\nnewspapers could be obtained. The voyage to London in those days was\r\nperformed in a sort of lumbering stagecoach, over an ill-paved and\r\ndimly-lighted road. To this Fox Inn, by a very old wooden gate at the\r\nback, the bodies of the drowned in the Serpentine used to be conveyed,\r\nto the care of the Royal Humane Society, who had a receiving-house here.\r\nAmong the many unhappy young and fair ones who were carried through that\r\n“_Lasciate-ogni-speranza_” gate, was Harriet Westbrook, the first wife\r\nof Shelley the poet, who had drowned herself in the Serpentine upon\r\nhearing that her husband had run off to Italy with Mary, the daughter of\r\nWilliam Godwin, bookseller and philosopher of Snow Hill. The ancient\r\ninn remained much in its Elizabethan condition till the year 1799, when\r\ncertain alterations cleared away the old-fashioned fire-places,\r\nchimney-pieces, and dog-irons, by which had sat the weather-beaten\r\nsoldiers of Cromwell, the highwaymen lying in ambush for the mail\r\ncoaches, and the fair London ladies out on a sly trip.\r\n\r\nSome other combinations are not so easily explained, such as the FOX AND\r\nCAP, Long Lane, Smithfield: but when we see the bill of this shop[233]\r\nthe mystery is explained; it was the sign of Tho. Tronsdale, a capmaker,\r\nand represented a fox running, with a cap painted above him, to intimate\r\nthe man’s business. The FOX AND CROWN, Nottingham and Newark, is\r\nevidently a combination of two signs. The FOX AND KNOT, Snow Hill, seems\r\nto be of old standing, as it has given its name to a court close by. Its\r\norigin, doubtless, is exactly similar to that of the Fox and Cap; the\r\nknot or top-knot being a head-dress worn by ladies in the last century.\r\nThe FLYING FOX at Colchester, may either allude to some kind of bat or\r\nflying squirrel (?) thus denominated, or is a landlord’s _caprice_.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly somewhat strange that in this sporting country the sign\r\nof the Brush or the Fox’s Tail should be so rare; in fact, no instance\r\nof its use is now to be found, although, beside the interest attached to\r\nit in the hunting field, it had the honour of being one of the badges of\r\nthe Lancaster family. What is still more surprising is, that the FOX’S\r\nTAIL should have been the sign of a Parisian bookseller, Jean Ruelle, in\r\n1540; but what prompted him to choose this sign is now rather difficult\r\nto guess.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the ballad of the “Vicar and Moses,” which says,\r\n\r\n  “_At the sign of the Horse_ old Spintext of course\r\n  Each night took his pipe and his pot,”\r\n\r\nthe horse rarely or never occurs without a distinctive adjective to\r\ndetermine its colour, action, or other attribute. All natural colours of\r\nthe horse, and some others, are found on the signboard--black, white,\r\nbay, sorrel, (rare,) pied, spotted, red, sometimes golden, and in one\r\ninstance, at Grantham, a BLUE Horse is met with. Frequently the sign of\r\nthe Horse is accompanied by the following hippophile advice:--\r\n\r\n  “Up hill hurry me not;\r\n  Down hill trot me not;\r\n  On level ground spare me not;\r\n  And in the stable I’m not forgot.”\r\n\r\nMany years ago, at Greenwich, there was a public-house with the sign of\r\na Horse. Behind the house was a large grass field, to which referred the\r\nfollowing notice, painted under the sign:--“Good Grass for Horses. LONG\r\nTAILS three shillings and sixpence per week.” An inquisitive person\r\npassing that way, and not understanding the meaning of the notice, went\r\nin and questioned the landlord, who informed him that a difference was\r\nmade for the bob-tailed horses; “for,” said he, “long-tailed horses can\r\nwhisk off the flies, and eat at their leisure; but bob-tails have to\r\nshake their heads and run about from morning till night, and so do eat\r\nmuch less.”\r\n\r\nThe RED HORSE is now almost extinct; it occurs as the sign of a house in\r\nBond Street, in an advertisement about a spaniel lost by the Duke of\r\nGrafton.[234] By the term _red_ was not meant vermilion; at that time it\r\nwas the accepted word for what we now call _roan_. The BAY HORSE is a\r\ngreat favourite in Yorkshire; in 1861 there were, in the West Riding\r\nalone, not less than seventy-seven inns, taverns, and public-houses,\r\nwith such a sign, besides innumerable ale-houses. One would expect the\r\nYORKSHIRE GREY more indigenous to that county. The DAPPLE GREY is\r\napparently a tribute of gratitude of the publicans to the “Dapple Grey”\r\nof the nursery rhyme--\r\n\r\n  “I had a little bonny nag,\r\n  His name was _Dapple Grey_,\r\n  And he would bring me to an ale-house\r\n  A mile out of the way.”\r\n\r\nDappled grey, too, was the fashionable colour of horses in the last\r\ncentury; thus Pope’s mercenary Duchess--\r\n\r\n  “The gods, to curse Pamela with her prayers,\r\n  Gave her gilt coach and dappled Flanders mares.”\r\n\r\nOf the WHITE HORSE innumerable instances occur, and many are\r\nconnected with names known in history. At the White Horse, near\r\nBurleigh-on-the-Hill, the noted Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, spent the\r\nlast years of his life, and died.\r\n\r\n  “The Duke of Queensbury being present at his death, knowing the Duke\r\n  to be a dissenter, and thinking he must be a Catholic, offered to send\r\n  for a Catholic priest, to which the Duke answered, ‘No,’ said he,\r\n  ‘those rascals eat God; but if you know of any set of fellows that eat\r\n  the devil, I should be obliged to you if you would send for one of\r\n  them!’”\r\n\r\nAll of a piece! So ended\r\n\r\n  “That life of pleasure, and that soul of whim.”[235]\r\n\r\nAt the White Horse in Kensington, Addison wrote several of his\r\n_Spectators_. His favourite dinner, when he stayed at this house, was\r\nfillet of veal and a bottle of claret. The old inn remained in its\r\noriginal state till about forty years ago, when it was pulled down, and\r\nthe name changed to the HOLLAND ARMS; but the sign is still preserved in\r\nthe parlour of the new establishment.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh also has its famous White Horse; in a close in the Canongate,\r\nan inn dating from the time of Queen Mary Stuart, and which Scott has\r\nintroduced in one of his novels, may still be seen. It was well-known to\r\nrunaway couples, and hundreds have been made happy or unhappy for life\r\n“at a moment’s notice,” in its large room, in which, as well as in the\r\nWhite Hart in the Grassmarket, these _impromptu_ marriages were as\r\nregularly performed as at Gretna Green. The WHITE HORSE CELLAR,\r\nPiccadilly, now a tame omnibus office, was for more than a century one\r\nof the bustling coaching inns for the West. “Some persons think the\r\nsublimest object in nature is a ship launched on the bosom of the ocean;\r\nbut give me, for my private satisfaction, the mail coaches that pour\r\ndown Piccadilly of an evening, tear up the pavement, and devour the way\r\nbefore them to the Land’s-End.”--_Hazlitt._ This place calls up pleasant\r\nfancies of travelling by the mail, through merry roads, with blooming\r\nhawthorn and chestnut trees, larks singing aloft, the village bells, and\r\nthe blacksmith’s hammer tinkling in the distance; but another White\r\nHorse Inn shows the dark side of the picture--the unsafety of the roads,\r\nfor the White Horse, corner of Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square, was\r\nlong a detached public-house, where travellers customarily stopped for\r\nrefreshment, and to examine their firearms before crossing the fields to\r\nLisson Green.[236] The last White Horse we shall mention was in Pope’s\r\nHead Alley, the sign of John Sudbury and George Humble, the first men\r\nthat opened a printshop in London, in the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Peacham, in his “Compleat Gentleman,” says that Goltzius’\r\nengravings were commonly to be had in Pope’s Head Alley. There also, in\r\n1611, the first edition of Speed’s “Great Britain” was published.\r\n\r\nAt a certain place in Warwickshire a fellow started a public-house near\r\nfour others, with signs respectively of the Bear, the Angel, the Ship,\r\nand the Three Cups. Yet quite undaunted at his neighbours, he put up the\r\nWhite Horse as his sign, and under it wrote the following spirited and\r\nprophetic rhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “My _White Horse_ shall bite the _Bear_,\r\n    And make the _Angel_ fly;\r\n  Shall turn the _Ship_ her bottom up,\r\n    And drink the _Three Cups_ dry.”\r\n\r\nAnd so it did; the lines pleased the people, the other houses soon lost\r\ntheir custom, and tradition says that the fellow made a considerable\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nThe RUNNING HORSE or the GALLOPING HORSE--perhaps originally the horse\r\nof Hanover--is also very common. In the _London Gazette_, Feb. 12-15,\r\n1699, a horse race is advertised at Lilly Hoo, in Hertford; the\r\nadvertisement concludes: “and on the same day a smock worth £3 will be\r\nrun for, besides other encouragements for those that come in 2d. or 3d.\r\nAny woman may run gratis, that enters her name at the Running Horse,\r\nwhere articles may be seen,” &c. Races by women were not uncommon in\r\nthose days, and instances may yet occasionally be heard of, particularly\r\nin the east end of London, where every great match generally concludes\r\nwith a race among the free and easy ladies of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe combinations in which we meet with the Horse are all very plain, and\r\nrequire no explanation. The HORSE AND GROOM, and the HORSE AND JOCKEY,\r\nare the most prevalent. Racing, from time immemorial, has been a\r\nfavourite English sport. Fitzstephen mentions the races in the days of\r\nHenry II., and in the ballad of Syr Bevys of Hampton,[237] full details\r\nare given.\r\n\r\n  “In somer at Whitsontide,\r\n  Whan knighten most on horseback ride,\r\n  A course let they make or a daye\r\n  Steedes and Palfraye for to assaye;\r\n  Which horse that best may ren,\r\n  Three miles the cours was then,\r\n  Who that might ride them shoulde\r\n  Have forty pounds of redy golde.”\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen Elizabeth races were much in vogue, and betting\r\ncarried to great excess. The famous George Earl of Cumberland is\r\nrecorded to have wasted more money than any of his ancestors, chiefly by\r\nracing and tilting. In 1599, private matches by gentlemen who rode their\r\nown horses were of frequent occurrence. In the reign of James I. public\r\nraces were celebrated at various places, under much the same regulations\r\nas now. The most celebrated were called Bellcourses. In the latter part\r\nof the reign of Charles I. there were races in Hyde Park as well as at\r\nNewmarket. Charles II. was very fond of this diversion, and appointed\r\nmeetings at Datchet Mead when he resided at Windsor. Gradually, however,\r\nNewmarket became the principal place. The king, a constant attendant,\r\nestablished a house for his own accommodation, and entered horses in his\r\nroyal name. Instead of bells, he gave a silver bowl or a cup, value 100\r\nguineas, on which the exploit and pedigree of the winning horse were\r\ngenerally engraved. William III. and Queen Anne both added to the plate.\r\nGeorge I., towards the end of his reign, discontinued the plate and gave\r\n100 guineas instead; George II. made several racing regulations, about\r\nthe age of horses, the weight of jockeys, &c. Already, in 1768, the\r\nhorses had obtained great swiftness; for Misson, in his “Travels,”\r\nmentions one that ran 20 miles in 55 minutes upon uneven ground, which\r\nfor those times was certainly a remarkable feat.\r\n\r\nThe BELL AND HORSE is an old and still frequent sign; it occurs on\r\ntrades tokens; as John Harcourt at the BELL AND BLACK HORSE in Finsbury,\r\n1668, and on various others; whilst at the present day it may be seen at\r\nmany a roadside alehouse. Bells were a favourite addition to the\r\ntrappings of horses in the middle ages. Chaucer’s abbot is described:--\r\n\r\n  “When he rode men his bridle hear,\r\n  Gingling in a whistling wind as clere,\r\n  And eke as loud as doth a chapel bell.”\r\n\r\nIn a MS. in the Cottonian Library[238] relating the journey of Margaret\r\nof England to Scotland, there to be married to King James, we find\r\nconstant mention of these bells. The horse of Sir William Ikarguil,\r\ncompanion of Sir William Conyars, sheriff of Yorkshire, is described as\r\n“his Hors Harnays full of campanes [bells] of silver and gylt.” Whilst\r\nthe master of the horse of the Duke of Northumberland was “monted apon a\r\ngentyll horse, and campanes of silver and gylt.” And a company of\r\nknights is introduced, “some of their hors harnes was full of campanes,\r\nsum of gold and sylver, and others of gold.” This led to the custom of\r\ngiving a golden bell as the reward of a race. In Chester, such a bell\r\nwas run for yearly on St George’s day; it was “dedicated to the kinge,\r\nbeing double gilt with the Kynges Armes upon it,” and was carried in the\r\nprocession by a man on horseback “upon a septer in pompe, and before him\r\na noise of trumpets in pompe.”[239] This custom of racing for a bell led\r\nto the adoption of the still common phrase, _bearing off the_ BELL.\r\n\r\nNames of celebrated race horses are found on signboards as well as human\r\ncelebrities. Such are BAY CHILDERS at Dronfield, Derby; FLYING CHILDERS\r\nat Melton Mowbray; WILD DAYRELL, Oldham; FILHO DA PUTA, Nottingham; and\r\nFILHO tavern, Manchester. BLINK BONNY is common in Northumberland;\r\nFLYING DUTCHMAN occurs in various places; and the ARABIAN HORSE at\r\nAberford, in Yorkshire, may perhaps represent the great Arabian\r\nGodolphin, the sire of all our famous racers.\r\n\r\nThe HORSE AND TIGER, at Rotherham, is said to refer to the accident in a\r\ntravelling menagerie which took place many years ago, when the tiger\r\nbroke loose and sprang upon the leaders of a passing mail coach,\r\nalthough visitors from London generally suppose the “tiger” to mean the\r\nspruce groom, or horse attendant, coming from the country to London in\r\nsuch numbers. Even that poor hack, the MANAGE HORSE, is not forgotten,\r\nas he may be seen going through his paces before a public-house in\r\nCottles Lane, Bath. In one of the turnings in Cannon Street, City, there\r\nis an old sign of the HORSE AND DORSITER, which is simply an old\r\nrendering of the more common PACK HORSE, formerly the usual sign of a\r\nposting inn. No doubt the FRIGHTED HORSE, which occurs in many places,\r\nbelongs to this class of horses,--the expression “fright” being a\r\ncorruption of _freight_. Some publicans who, with their trade combine\r\nthe calling of farrier, set up the sign of the HORSE AND FARRIER,--in\r\nIreland rendered as the BLEEDING HORSE. A Dutch farrier in the village\r\nof Schagen, in the seventeenth century, put up the sign of the WHITE\r\nHORSE, and wrote under it the following very philosophical verse:--\r\n\r\n  “In ’t witte Paard worden de paarden haar voeten met yzer beslagen\r\n  Dat men de menschen dat mee kon doen zy hoefden dan geen schoenen te\r\n  dragen.”[240]\r\n\r\nThe HORSE AND STAG, (Finningley, Nottinghamshire,) and the HORSE AND\r\nGATE, are both hunting signs; yet the last may have been suggested by\r\nthe Bull and Gate. The HORSE AND TRUMPET is a very common sign,\r\nillustrating the war horse; the HORSE AND CHAISE (or shaze, as it is\r\nspelled) in the Broad _Centry_, (sanctuary,) Westminster, is named in an\r\nadvertisement in the _Postboy_, Jan. 23-25, 1711; whilst the CHAISE AND\r\nPAIR is still to be seen at Northill, Colchester.\r\n\r\nThe NAG’S HEAD--which only in one instance is varied by the HORSE’S\r\nHEAD, namely, at Brampton in Cumberland--is a sign that has become\r\nfamous in history; it is represented on the print of the entry of Queen\r\nMarie de’ Medici on her visit to her daughter Henriette Marie, Queen of\r\nCharles I., being the sign of a notorious tavern opposite the Cheapside\r\nCross. It is suspended from a long square beam, at the end of which a\r\nlarge crown of evergreens is seen. As none of the other houses are\r\ndecked with greens, this apparently represents the Bush.[241] This\r\ntavern was the fictitious scene of the consecration of the Protestant\r\nbishops at the accession of Queen Elizabeth in 1559. It was pretended by\r\nthe adversaries of the Protestant faith, that a certain number of\r\necclesiastics, in a hurry to take possession of the vacant sees,\r\nassembled here; where they were to undergo the ceremony from Antony\r\nKitchen, _alias_ Dunstane, Bishop of Llandaff, a sort of occasional\r\nNonconformist, who had taken the oath of supremacy to Elizabeth; Bonner,\r\nBishop of London, (then confined in the Tower,) hearing of it, sent his\r\nchaplain to Kitchen, threatening him with excommunication in case he\r\nproceeded. On this the prelate refused to perform the ceremony;\r\nwhereupon, according to Catholics, Parker and the other candidates,\r\nrather than defer possession of their dioceses, determined to consecrate\r\none another, which they did, without any sort of scruple. Scorey began\r\nwith Parker, who instantly rose Archbishop of Canterbury. The refutation\r\nof this tale may be read in Strype’s life of Archbishop Parker.[242]\r\n\r\nA curious anecdote is told concerning the sign of a GELDING. Golden\r\nSquare, it appears, was originally called Gelding Square, from the sign\r\nof a neighbouring inn; but the inhabitants, indignant at the vulgarity\r\nof the name, changed it to its present title.\r\n\r\nSome publicans appear to be of opinion that the GREY MARE is the best\r\nhorse for their signboards; in Lancashire, especially, this sign\r\nabounds. Others put up the MARE AND FOAL; but they are evidently not\r\nvery well acquainted with the old ballad of the “Mare and Foal that went\r\nto church,” for there the Mare says:--\r\n\r\n  “Oh! to pray for those publicans I am very loath,\r\n  They fill their pots full of nothing but froth,\r\n  Some fill them half full, and others the whole;\r\n  May the devil go with them!--Amen, says the foal.\r\n                              Derry down,” &c.\r\n\r\nBesides the Mare and Foal, there is the COW AND CALF, which is very\r\ncommon. A still more happy mother, the COW AND TWO CALVES, was, in 1762,\r\na sign near Chelsea Pond; whilst a touching picture of paternal bliss\r\nmight have been seen on a sign in Islington in the last century, viz.,\r\nthe BULL AND THREE CALVES; that animal, doubtless, was placed there in\r\nthe company of his offspring, to illustrate the homely old proverb, “He\r\nthat bulls the cow must keep the calf.” The GOAT AND KID was a sign at\r\nNorwich in 1711;[243] the SOW AND PIGS is common; and the EWE AND LAMB\r\noccurs on a trades token of Hatton Garden in 1668, and may still be seen\r\nin many places. A practical traveller in the coaching days, staying at\r\nthe Ewe and Lamb in Worcester, wrote on a pane of glass in that inn the\r\nfollowing very true remark:--\r\n\r\n  “If the people suck your ale no more\r\n  Than the poor Lamb, th’ Ewe at the door,\r\n  You in some other place may dwell,\r\n  Or hang yourself for all you’ll sell.”\r\n\r\nThe CAT AND KITTENS was, about 1823, a sign near Eastcheap; it may have\r\ncome from the publican’s slang expression, _cat and kittens_, as applied\r\nto the large and small pewter pots. In the police courts it is not\r\nuncommon to hear that such and such low persons have been “had up” for\r\n“cat and kitten sneaking,” _i.e._, stealing quart and pint pots.\r\n\r\nSo much for quadrupeds. Happy families of birds are equally abundant;\r\nthere was the SPARROW’S NEST in Drury Lane, of which trades tokens are\r\nextant; the THROSTLE NEST, (a not inappropriate name for a free-and-easy\r\nsinging club!) is the sign of a public-house at Buglawton, near\r\nCongleton; the MARTIN’S NEST, at Thornhill Bridge, Normanton; the KITE’S\r\nNEST, (an unpromising name for an inn, if there be anything in a name,)\r\nat Stretton, in Herefordshire; and finally, the BROOD HEN, or HEN AND\r\nCHICKENS, which latter is more common than any of the former. Not\r\nimprobably it originated with the sign of the Pelican’s Nest, to which\r\nseveral of the above-named nests may be referred. Under the name of the\r\n“Brood Hen,” it occurs on a trades token of Battle Bridge, Southwark; as\r\nthe “Hen and Chickens,” it was also known in the seventeenth century,\r\nfor there are tokens of John Sell “at y^{e} Hen and Chickens on\r\nHammond’s Key;” it is likewise mentioned in the following daily\r\noccurrence of the good old times:--\r\n\r\n  “Wednesday night last, Captain Lambert was stopt by three footpads\r\n  near the Hen and Chickens, between Peckham and Camberwell, and robbed\r\n  of a sum of money and his gold watch.”[244]\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of this sign may be accounted for by the kindred love for\r\nthe _barleycorn_ in the human and gallinaceous tribes. It was also used\r\nas a sign by Paulus Sessius, a bookseller of Prague, in 1606, who\r\nprinted some of Kepler’s astronomical works; above his colophon,\r\nrepresenting the hen and her offspring, is the motto: “GRANA DAT A FIMO\r\nSCRUTANS,” the application of which is not very obvious.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of birds’ nests figuring as signs, we may mention that, at the\r\nbeginning of the present century, the small shops under the tree at the\r\ncorner of Milk Street, City, used to describe themselves as “under the\r\nCrow’s Nest, Cheapside.” An old-fashioned snuff shop, still in\r\nexistence, issued its tobacco papers in this way, and the small bookshop\r\nthere at present advertises itself as “under the tree,” although it was\r\nonly very recently that the crow ceased to visit and repair his nest\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe THREE COLTS, in Bride Lane, 1652, is represented on a trades token\r\nby three colts running; such a sign gave its name to a street in\r\nLimehouse. The HORSESHOE is a favourite in combination with other\r\nsubjects. Aubrey, in his “Miscellanies,” p. 148, says:--\r\n\r\n  “It is a very common thing to nail horseshoes on the thresholds of\r\n  doors, which is to hinder the power of witches that enter into the\r\n  house. Most houses of the West End of London have the horseshoe on the\r\n  threshold; it should be a horseshoe that one finds.”\r\n\r\nElsewhere he says:--\r\n\r\n  “Under the Porch of Staninfield Church in Suffolk, I saw a tile with\r\n  a horseshoe upon it placed there for this purpose, though one would\r\n  imagine that the holy water would have been sufficient.”\r\n\r\nConcerning the same superstition Brand observes:--\r\n\r\n  “I am told there are many other similar instances. In Monmouth Street\r\n  (probably the part alluded to by Aubrey) many horseshoes nailed to the\r\n  threshold are still to be seen. In 1813 not less than 17 remained,\r\n  nailed against the steps of doors. The bawds of Amsterdam believed in\r\n  1687, that a horseshoe which had either been found or stolen placed on\r\n  the hearth would bring good luck to their houses.”[245]\r\n\r\nThe charm of the horseshoe lies in its being forked and presenting two\r\npoints; thus Herrick says:--\r\n\r\n  “Hang up _hooks_ and _sheers_, to scare\r\n  Hence the hag that rides the mare;\r\n  Till they be all over wet\r\n  With the mire and the sweat,\r\n  This observ’d the manes shall be\r\n  Of your horses all knot-free.”[246]\r\n\r\nAny forked object, therefore, has the power to drive witches away. Hence\r\nthe children in Italy and Spain are generally seen with a piece of\r\nforked coral (coral is particularly efficacious) hung round their necks,\r\nwhilst even the mules and other cattle are armed with a small crescent\r\nformed by two boars’ tusks, or else a forked piece of wood, to avert the\r\nspells of what Macbeth calls “the juggling fiends.” Even the two\r\nforefingers held out apart are thought sufficient to avert the evil eye,\r\nor prevent the machinations of the lord and master of the nether world.\r\nGreat power also lies in the pentagram and Solomon’s seal, which, being\r\ncomposed of two triangles, present not less than six forked ends. Both\r\nthese figures are much used by the Moors, with the same object in view\r\nas the horseshoe by western nations. In this country, at the present\r\nday, scarcely a stable can be seen where there is not a horseshoe nailed\r\non the door or lintel; there is one very conspicuous at the gate of\r\nMeux’s brewery at the corner of Tottenham Court Road, and conspicuous on\r\nthe horse trappings of this establishment the shoe in polished brass may\r\nbe seen; in fact, it has become the trade-mark of the firm, the same as\r\nthe red triangle which distinguishes the pale ale of the Burton brewers.\r\nThe iron heels of workmen’s boots are also frequently seen fixed against\r\nthe doorpost, or behind the door, of houses of the lower classes.\r\n\r\nThe HORSESHOE, by itself, is comparatively a rare sign. There is a\r\nHorseshoe Tavern, mentioned by Aubrey in connexion with one of those\r\nreckless deeds of bloodshed so common in the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies:--\r\n\r\n  “Captain Carlo Fantom, a Croatian, spake 13 languages, was a captain\r\n  under the Erle of Essex. He had a world of cuts about his body with\r\n  swords and was very quarrelsome and a great ravisher. He met coming\r\n  late at night out of the Horseshoe Tavern in Drury Lane with a\r\n  lieutenant of Colonel Rossiter, who had great jingling spurs on. Said\r\n  he, the noise of your spurrs doe offend me, you must come over the\r\n  kennel and give me satisfaction. They drew and passed at each other,\r\n  and the lieutenant was runne through and died in an hour or two, and\r\n  it was not known who killed him.”[247]\r\n\r\nThis tavern was still in existence in 1692, as appears from the\r\ndeposition of one of the witnesses in the murder of Mountfort the actor\r\nby Captain Hill, who, with his accomplice, Lord Mohun, whilst they were\r\nlaying in wait for Mrs Bracegirdle, drank a bottle of canary which had\r\nbeen bought at the Horseshoe Tavern.\r\n\r\nThe THREE HORSESHOES are not uncommon; and the single shoe may be met\r\nwith in many combinations, arising from the old belief in its lucky\r\ninfluences: thus the HORSE AND HORSESHOE was the sign of William Warden,\r\nat Dover, in the seventeenth century, as appears from his token. The SUN\r\nAND HORSESHOE is still a public-house sign in Great Tichfield Street,\r\nand the MAGPIE AND HORSESHOE may be seen carved in wood in Fetterlane;\r\nthe magpie is perched within the horseshoe, a bunch of grapes being\r\nsuspended from it. The HORNS AND HORSESHOE is represented on the token\r\nof William Grainge in Gutterlane, 1666,--a horseshoe within a pair of\r\nantlers. The LION AND HORSESHOE appears in the following advertisement\r\nof a shooting match:--\r\n\r\n  “ON FRIDAY the 16th of this instant, at two in the afternoon, will be\r\n  a plate to be (_sic_) shot for, at twenty-five guineas value, in the\r\n  Artillerie Ground near Moorfields. No gun to exceed four feet and a\r\n  half in the barrel, the distance to be 200 yards, and but one shot a\r\n  piece, the nearest the centre to win. No person that shoots to be less\r\n  than one guinea, but as many more as he pleases to compleat the sum.\r\n  The money to be put in the hands of Mr Jones, at the Lion and\r\n  Horseshoe Tavern, or Mr Turog, gunsmith in the Minories. Note, that if\r\n  any gentleman has a mind to shoot for the whole, there is a person\r\n  will shoot with him for it, being left out by mistake in our\r\n  last.”[248]\r\n\r\nThe HOOP AND HORSESHOE on Towerhill, was formerly called the Horseshoe.\r\nThis, like every old tavern, has its murder to record:--\r\n\r\n  “The last week one Colonel John Scott took an occasion to kill one\r\n  John Buttler, a hackney coachman, at the Horse Shoe Tavern on Tower\r\n  Hill, without any other provocation ’tis said, but refusing to carry\r\n  him and another gentleman pertaining to the law, from thence to Temple\r\n  Bar for 1s. 6d. Amongst the many pranks that he hath played in other\r\n  countries ’tis believed this is one of the very worst. He is a very\r\n  great vindicator of the Salamanca Doctor. He is a lusty, tall man,\r\n  squint eyed, thin faced, wears a peruke sometimes and has a very h----\r\n  look. All good people would do well if they can to apprehend him that\r\n  he may be brought to justice.”[249]\r\n\r\nThe HORSESHOE AND CROWN is named in the following handbill, which is too\r\ncharacteristic to curtail:--\r\n\r\n  “DAUGHTER OF A SEVENTH DAUGHTER.\r\n  REMOVED TO THE SIGN OF THE HORSESHOE AND CROWN IN CASTLE STREET,\r\n  NEAR THE 7 DIALS IN ST GILES.\r\n\r\n  _Liveth a Gentlewoman, the Daughter of a Seventh Daughter, who far\r\n  exceeds all her sex, her business being very great amongst the\r\n  quality, has now thought fit to make herself known to the benefit of\r\n  the Publick._\r\n\r\n  She resolves these questions following:--As to Life whether happy or\r\n  unhappy? the best time of it past or to come? Servants or lodgers if\r\n  honest or not? To marry the person desir’d or who they shall marry and\r\n  when? A Friend if real or not? a Woman with child or not, or ever\r\n  likely to have any! A friend absent dead or alive, if alive when\r\n  return? Journey by Land or voyages by Sea, the Success thereof.\r\n  Lawsuits, which shall gain the better? She also Interprets Dreams.\r\n  These and all other lawful questions which for brevity sake are\r\n  omitted, she fully resolves.\r\n\r\n  Her hours are from 7 in the Morning till 12, and from 1 till 8 at\r\n  Night.”[250]\r\n\r\nThese quack “gentlewomen” were as much the order of that day as the\r\nbroken-down clergymen who advertise medicines for nervous and rheumatic\r\ncomplaints are in our own time. Heywood, in his play of “the Wise Woman\r\nof Hogsden,” enumerates the following occupations as their\r\nperquisites:--\r\n\r\n  “Let me see how many trades have I to live by: First, I am a wise\r\n  woman and a fortuneteller, and under that I deale in physick and\r\n  fore-speaking, in palmestry and things lost. Next I undertake to cure\r\n  madd folks; Then I keepe gentlewomen lodgers, to furnish such chambers\r\n  as I let out by the night; Then I am provided for bringing young\r\n  wenches to bed; and for a need you see I can play the matchmaker.”\r\n\r\nGenerally they proclaimed themselves the seventh daughter of a seventh\r\ndaughter, a relationship that is still thought to be accompanied by\r\npowers not vouchsafed to ordinary mortals. This belief in the virtue of\r\nthe number 7 doubtless originated from the Old Testament, where that\r\nnumber seems in greater favour than all others. The books of Moses are\r\nfull of references to it; the creation of the world in 7 days, sevenfold\r\nvengeance on whosoever slayeth Cain; Noah had to take 7 males and\r\nfemales of every clean beast, 7 males and females of every fowl of the\r\nair, for in 7 days it would begin to rain; the ark rested in the 7th\r\nmonth, &c., &c. From this the middle ages borrowed their predilection\r\nfor this number, and its cabalistic power.[251]\r\n\r\nHorned cattle are just as common as horses on the signboards; the BULL,\r\nin particular, is a favourite with the nation, whether as a namesake--so\r\nmuch so, indeed, as to have given it a popular name abroad--or as the\r\nsource of the favourite roast-beef, or from the ancient sport of\r\nbull-baiting, it is difficult to say. From Ben Jonson we gather that\r\nthere was another reason which sometimes dictated the choice of this\r\nanimal on the signboard. In the “Alchymist” he introduces a shopkeeper,\r\nwho wishes the learned Doctor to provide him with a sign.\r\n\r\n  “_Face._ What say you to his Constellation, Doctor, the Balance?\r\n\r\n  _Sub._ _No, that is stale and common:\r\n  A Townsman born in Taurus gives the Bull\r\n  Or the Bull’s head: in Aries, the Ram,\r\n  A poor device._”--ALCHYMIST, a. ii. s. i.\r\n\r\nNewton dates a letter from “the Bull,” at Shoreditch, September 1693; it\r\nis addressed to Locke, and a curious letter it is, containing an apology\r\nfor having wished Locke dead.\r\n\r\nThe Bull is generally represented in his natural colour, _black_,\r\n_white_, _grey_, _pied_, “_spangled_” (in Yorkshire,) and only rarely\r\n_red_ and _blue_; yet these two last colours may simply imply the\r\nnatural red, brown, and other common hues, for newspapers of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries often contain advertisements about\r\n_blue_ dogs; and whatever shade that was intended for, it may certainly\r\nwith as much justice be applied to a bull as to a dog. The CHAINED BULL\r\nat North Allerton, Leeds, and the BULL AND CHAIN, Langworthgate,\r\nLincoln, doubtless refer to the old cruel pastime of bull-baitings.\r\nOccasionally we meet also with a WILD BULL, as at Gisburn, near Skipton.\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt observes:--“London has a modern look to the inhabitants; but\r\npersons who come from the country find as odd and remote-looking things\r\nin it as the Londoners do in York and Chester; and among these are a\r\nvariety of old inns with corridors running round the yard. They are well\r\nworth a glance from anybody who has a respect for old times.” Such a one\r\nis the Bull’s Inn in Bishopsgate Street, where formerly plays were\r\nacted by Burbadge, Shakespeare’s fellow-comedian, and Tarlton in good\r\nQueen Bess’s time amused our forefathers on summers’ afternoons with his\r\nquaint jokes and comic parts.[252] This inn is also celebrated as the\r\nLondon house of the famous Hobson, (Hobson’s choice,) the rich Cambridge\r\ncarrier. Here a painted figure of him was to be seen in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, with a hundred pound bag under his arm, on which was the\r\nfollowing inscription:--“The fruitful Mother of a Hundred More.”[253] At\r\nthe Bull public-house on Towerhill, Thomas Otway, the play writer, died\r\nof want at the age of 33, on the 14th of April 1685, having retired to\r\nthis house to escape his creditors.[254]\r\n\r\nThe BULL, at Ware, obtained a celebrity by its enormous bed. Taylor, the\r\nWater poet, in 1636 remarked, “Ware is a great thorowfare, and hath many\r\nfair innes, with very large bedding, and one high and mighty Bed called\r\nthe _Great Bed of Ware_: a man may seeke all England over and not find a\r\nmarried couple that can fill it.” Nares, in his “Glossary,” quotes\r\nChauncey’s, Hertfordshire; for a story of twelve married couple who,\r\nlaid together in the bed, each pair being so placed at the top and\r\nbottom of the bed, that the head of one pair was at the feet of another.\r\nShakespeare alludes to it in “Twelfth Night,” where Sir Toby Belch in\r\nhis drunken humour advises Aguecheek to write: “as many lies as will lie\r\nin this sheet of paper, though the sheet were big enough for the _Bed of\r\nWare_ in England,” (a. iii. s. 2.) Where the “high and mighty Bed” was\r\nlocated, seems a mooted point; some say at the Bull, others at the\r\nCrown, and Clutterbuck places it at the Saracen’s Head, where there is\r\nor was a bed of some twelve feet square, in an Elizabethan style of\r\ncarved oak, but with the date 1463 painted on the back. Tradition says\r\nthat it was the bed of Warwick the king-maker, and was bought at a sale\r\nof furniture at Ware Park. Recently it has been sold, and Charles\r\nDickens is now said to be its possessor.\r\n\r\nThe Bull Inn at Buckland, near Dover, deserves to be mentioned for its\r\ncomical caution to the customers:\r\n\r\n  “The Bull is tame so fear him not,\r\n  All the while you pay your shot.\r\n  When money’s gone, and credit’s bad,\r\n  It’s that which makes the Bull run mad.”\r\n\r\nThe famous OLD PIED BULL INN, Islington, was pulled down _circa_ 1827,\r\nthe house having existed from the time of Queen Elizabeth. The parlour\r\nretained its original character to the last. There was a chimney-piece\r\ncontaining Hope, Faith, and Charity, with a border of cherubims, fruit\r\nand foliage, whilst the ceiling in stucco represented the five senses.\r\nSir Walter Raleigh is said to have been an inhabitant of this house.\r\n\r\n  “This conjecture is somewhat strengthened by the nature of the border\r\n  [in a stained glass window,] which was composed of seahorses,\r\n  mermaids, parrots, &c., forming a most appropriate allusion to the\r\n  character of Raleigh, as a great navigator, and discoverer of unknown\r\n  countries; and the bunch of green leaves [two seahorses supporting a\r\n  bunch of green leaves,] has been generally asserted to represent the\r\n  tobacco plant, of which he is said to have been the first importer\r\n  into this country.”[255]\r\n\r\nAt what time the house was converted into an inn does not appear. The\r\nsign of the Pied Bull in stone relief, on the front towards the south,\r\nbore the date 1730, which was probably the year this addition was made\r\nto the building. That it was an inn in 1665, appears from the following\r\nepisode of the Plague-time:\r\n\r\n  “I remember one citizen, who, having thus broken out of his house in\r\n  Aldersgate Street, or there about, went along the road to Islington.\r\n  He attempted to have gone in at the Angel Inn, and after that at the\r\n  White Horse, two inns known still by the same signs, but was refused;\r\n  after which he came to the _Pied Bull_, an inn also still continuing\r\n  the same sign. He asked them for lodging for one night only,\r\n  pretending to be going into Lincolnshire, and assuring them of his\r\n  being very sound, and free from the infection, which also at that time\r\n  had not reached much that way. They told him they had no lodging, that\r\n  they could spare but one bed up in the garret, and that they could\r\n  spare that bed but for one night, some drovers being expected the next\r\n  day with cattle; so if he would accept of that lodging, he might have\r\n  it, which he did; so a servant was sent up with a candle with him, to\r\n  show him the room. He was very well dressed, and looked like a person\r\n  not used to lie in a garret; and when he came to the room he fetched a\r\n  deep sigh, and said to the servant, ‘I have seldom lain in such a\r\n  lodging as this;’ however, the servant assured him again that they had\r\n  no better. ‘Well,’ says he, ‘I must make shift; this is a dreadful\r\n  time, but it is but for one night.’ So he sat down upon the bed-side,\r\n  and bade the maid, I think it was, fetch him up a pint of warm ale.\r\n  Accordingly the servant went for the ale; but some hurry in the house,\r\n  which perhaps employed her otherwise, put it out of her head, and she\r\n  went up no more to him. The next morning, seeing no appearance of the\r\n  gentleman, somebody in the house asked the servant that had showed him\r\n  up stairs, what was become of him. She started; ‘alas,’ said she, ‘I\r\n  never thought more of him; he bade me carry him some warm ale, but I\r\n  forgot.’ Upon which, not the maid, but some other person was sent up\r\n  to see after him, who coming into the room found him stark dead, and\r\n  almost cold, stretched out across the bed. His clothes were pulled\r\n  off, his jaw fallen, his eyes open in a most frightful posture, the\r\n  rug of the bed being grasped hard in one of his hands; so that it was\r\n  plain he died soon after the maid left him; and that it is probable,\r\n  had she gone up with the ale, she had found him dead in a few minutes\r\n  after he sat down upon the bed. The alarm was great in the house, as\r\n  any one may suppose, they having been free from the distemper till\r\n  that disaster; which bringing the infection to the house, spread it\r\n  immediately to other houses round about it. I do not remember how many\r\n  died in the house itself, but I think the maid-servant who went up\r\n  first with him, fell presently ill by the fright, and several others;\r\n  for whereas there died but two in Islington of the plague the week\r\n  before, there died seventeen the week after, whereof fourteen were of\r\n  the plague. This was in the week from the 11th of July to the\r\n  18th.”[256]\r\n\r\nThe RED BULL was the sign of another of the inn-playhouses in\r\nShakespeare’s time; but, like the Fortune, mostly frequented by the\r\nmeaner sorts of people. It was situated in Woodbridge Street,[257]\r\nClerkenwell, (its site is still called Red Bull Yard,) and is supposed\r\nto have been erected in the early part of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. At\r\nall events, it was one of the seventeen playhouses that arose in London\r\nbetween that period and the reign of Charles I. Edward Alleyn the actor,\r\nfounder of Dulwich College, says in a memorandum, Oct. 3, 1617, “went to\r\nthe Red Bull and received for the ‘Younger Brother’ [a play], but\r\n£3-6-4.” Killigrew’s troop of the king’s players performed in it until\r\nthe theatre in Lincoln’s-Inn-fields opened. The place was then abandoned\r\nto exhibitions of gladiators and feats of strength. The names of the\r\nprincipal theatres at the time of the Commonwealth occur in the\r\nfollowing puritanical curse:--\r\n\r\n                  “---- That the _Globe_\r\n  Wherein (quoth he) reigns a whole world of vice,\r\n  Had been consumed, the _Phenix_ burnt to ashes,\r\n  The _Fortune_ whipp’d for a blind--_Blackfriars_,\r\n  He wonders how it ’scaped demolishing\r\n  I’ the time of Reformation; lastly he wished\r\n  The _Bull_ might cross the Thames to the _Bear-gardens_,\r\n  And there be soundly baited.”[258]\r\n\r\nThe BULL’S HEAD is often seen instead of the Bull; its origin may be\r\nfrom the butchers’ arms, which are azure two axes salterwise, arg.\r\nbetween two roses _arg._ as many _bulls’ heads_ couped of the second\r\nattired _or_, &c.; in Holland a carved bull’s head is always a\r\nleather-seller’s sign. At the BULL’S HEAD, in Claremarket, the artists’\r\nclub used to meet, of which Hogarth was a member, and Dr Ratcliffe a\r\nconstant visitor. The Bull’s Head was already used in signs three\r\nhundred years ago, as we may see from an entry in Machyn’s Diary, which\r\ndoes not say much for the morality of the period:--\r\n\r\n  “The xij day of June (1560) dyd ryd in a care[259] abowt London ij men\r\n  and iij women; one man, for he was the bowd and to brynge women unto\r\n  strangers; and on women was the wyff of the _Bell_ in Gracyous Strett;\r\n  and a-nodur the wyff of the _Bull-hed_ besyd London Stone, and boyth\r\n  were bawdes and hores and the thodur man and the woman were brodur and\r\n  syster and wher taken nakyd together.”\r\n\r\nAs a variation, on the Bull’s Head there is the COW’S FACE:--\r\n\r\n  “GEORGE TURNIDGE, aged about 16, a short thickset Lad with a little\r\n  dark brown Hair, a scar in his left cheek under his eye, wears a\r\n  canvass jacket lined with red and canvass Breeches, with a red cap,\r\n  run away from his Master the 7th instant. Whoever secures him and\r\n  gives Notice to Mr Henry Davis, Waxchandler at the Cow’s Face in Miles\r\n  Lane in Canon Street, shall have a Guinea Reward, and reasonable\r\n  charges.”--_London Gazette_, Jan. 13-17, 1697.\r\n\r\nThe BULL’S NECK is a sign at Penny Hill, Holbeach, and the BUFFALO HEAD\r\nis common in many places. The latter was the sign of one of the\r\ncoffee-houses near the Exchange, during the South Sea bubble, and was\r\nhung up over the head quarters of a company for a grand dispensary,\r\ncapital £3,000,000. The rage for joint-stock companies had come to such\r\na pitch at that period, that an advertisement appeared stating:--\r\n\r\n  “THIS DAY the 8th instant at Sam’s Coffeehouse behind the Royal\r\n  Exchange, at three in the afternoon, a book will be opened, for\r\n  entering into a joint copartnership for carrying on a _thing_ that\r\n  will turn to the advantage of those concerned.”\r\n\r\nNot less than £28,000,000 were asked for at that period to enter upon\r\nvarious speculations. At the Buffalo Head Tavern, Charing Cross, Duncan\r\nCampbell, the deaf and dumb fortune-teller, used at one time to deliver\r\nhis oracles. He is immortalised in the _Spectator_, No. 474, where, in\r\nanswer to the letter of a lady inquiring about Duncan’s address, a note\r\nis entered, “That the Inspector I employ about Wonders, inquire at the\r\nGolden Lyon, opposite the Halfmoon Tavern, Drury Lane, into the merit of\r\nthis silent sage.”[260]\r\n\r\nAmong the combinations in which the Bull is met with on signboards, the\r\nBULL AND DOG is one of the most common, derived, like the Bull and\r\nChain, from the favourite sport of bull-baiting, which amusement is\r\ndescribed at full length and in brilliant colours by Misson, in his\r\n“Travels.” A comical variation of this is the BULL AND BITCH at Husborn\r\nCrawley, Woburn. In the sign of the BULL AND BUTCHER,[261] the bull is\r\nplaced in still worse company; this was very forcibly expressed on the\r\nsign of a butcher in Amsterdam, who was represented with a glass of wine\r\nin his hand, standing between two calves, and pledging them with the\r\ncruel words,--\r\n\r\n      “Zyt verblyt\r\n  Soo lang gy er zyt.”[262]\r\n\r\nThe BULL AND MAGPIE, which occurs at Boston, has been explained as\r\nmeaning the Pie, πιναξ, and the Bull of the Romish Church; but this\r\nlooks very like a cock-and-bull story. As “some help to thicken other\r\nproofs that also demonstrate thinly,” as Iago has it, it may be asked\r\nwhether this might not have arisen out of the sign of the “Pied Bull,”\r\nthus leading to the “Pie and Bull,” or the “Bull and Magpie;” the\r\ntransition seems simple and easy enough; but should this not be\r\nconsidered satisfactory, since we have the “Cock and Bull,” and the\r\n“Cock and Pie,” we may by a sort of rule of three manœuvre obtain the\r\nBull and Pie or Magpie. _See under_ Bird Signs.\r\n\r\nThe BLACK BULL AND LOOKING-GLASS is named in an advertisement in the\r\noriginal edition of the _Spectator_, No. lxviii., as a house in\r\nCornhill. It was evidently a combination of two signs.\r\n\r\nStill more puzzling is the BULL AND BEDPOST; but as the actual use of\r\nthis sign as a house decoration remains to be corroborated, we may\r\ndismiss it with the remark, that the Bedpost, in all probability, was a\r\njocular name for the stake to which the bull was tied when being\r\nbaited, in allusion to the stout stick formerly used in bed-making to\r\nsmooth the clothes in their place. The BULL AND SWAN, High Street,\r\nStamford, may be heraldic, both these animals being badges of the York\r\nfamily; but the Swan in all probability was the first sign, the Bull\r\nbeing added on account of the singular custom of Bull Running, which\r\nyearly took place, both at Tamworth and Stamford, on St John’s eve. THE\r\nBULL IN THE POUND, is the Bull punished for trespass, and put in the\r\npound or pinfold; whilst the BULL AND OAK at Wicker, Sheffield, (at\r\nMarket Bosworth there is a house with the sign of the BULL IN THE OAK,)\r\n_may_ have originated from the sign of “the Bull” being suspended from\r\nan oak tree, or referring to an oak tree standing near the house. Bulls\r\nare often tied to trees or posts in pastures, and this also may have\r\ngiven rise to the sign.\r\n\r\nVisitors to the Isle of Wight will have noticed the word BUGLE\r\nfrequently inscribed under the picture of a Bull on the inn signboards\r\nthere. Bugle is a provincial name in those parts for a wild bull. It is\r\nan old English word, and is used by Sir John Mandeville; “homes of grete\r\noxen, or of _bugles_, or of kygn.” It was still current in the\r\nseventeenth century, for Randle Holme, 1688, classes the “Bugle, or\r\nBubalus,” amongst “the savage beasts of the greater sort.” The horns of\r\nthis animal, used as a musical instrument, gave a name to the Buglehorn.\r\nIt may be remarked that the term _bugle_ doubtless came, in old times,\r\nwith other Gallicisms common to Sussex and Hampshire, from across the\r\nChannel, where the word _bugle_ is still preserved in the verb\r\n_beugler_, the common French word for the lowing of cattle.\r\n\r\nThe OX is rather uncommon; the DURHAM OX and the CRAVEN OX, two famous\r\nbreeds, are sometimes met with; then there is a CRAVEN OX HEAD, in\r\nGeorge Street, York, and a GREY OX at Brighouse, in the West Riding. The\r\nOX AND COMPASSES at Poulton Swindon, in Cumberland, is evidently a\r\njocular imitation of the London sign of the Goat and Compasses.\r\n\r\nThe COW is more common; its favourite colours being RED, BROWN, WHITE,\r\nSPOTTED, SPANGLED, &c. The Red Cow occurs as a sign near Holborn\r\nConduit, on the seventeenth century trades tokens. It also gave a name\r\nto the alehouse in Anchor and Hope Lane, Wapping, in which Lord\r\nChancellor Jeffries was taken prisoner, disguised as a sailor, and\r\ntrying to escape to the Continent after the abdication of James II.\r\nThinking himself safe in this neighbourhood, he was looking out of the\r\nwindow to while the time away, when he was recognised by a clerk who\r\nbore him a grudge, and at once betrayed him. An heraldic origin is not\r\nnecessary for this colour of the cow.\r\n\r\n  “Cows (I mean that whole species of horned beasts) are more commonly\r\n  black than _Red_ in England. ’Tis for this reason that they have a\r\n  greater value for Red Cow’s Milk than for Black Cow’s Milk. Whereas in\r\n  France we esteem the Black Cow’s Milk, because _Red_ Cows are more\r\n  common with us.”[263]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Green Walk, St James’s Park, Tom Brown says: “There were\r\na cluster of senators talking of state affairs, and the price of corn\r\nand cattle, and were disturbed with the noisy Milk folk crying: A can of\r\nMilk, Ladies; a can of _Red_ Cow’s Milk, sirs?”[264] The preference for\r\nthe _Red_ Cow’s milk may, however, have a more remote origin, namely,\r\nfrom the ordinance of the law contained in Numbers xix. 2, where a _red_\r\nheifer is enjoined to be sacrificed as a purification for sin. Hence,\r\n_Red_ Cow’s milk is particularly recommended in old prescriptions and\r\npanacea, as, for instance, in the following receipt of “a Cock water for\r\na Consumption and Cough of the Lunges:”--\r\n\r\n  “Take a running cock and pull him alive, then kill him and cutt him in\r\n  pieces and take out his intrailes and wipe him cleane, breake the\r\n  bones, then put him into an ordinary still with a pottle of sack and a\r\n  pottle of _Red Cow’s Milk_,” &c., &c.[265]\r\n\r\nThe Red Cow, in Bow Street, was the sign of a noted tavern, (afterwards\r\ncalled the Red Rose,) which stood at the corner of Rose Alley. It was\r\nwhen going home from this tavern that Dryden was cudgelled by bravoes,\r\nhired by Lord Rochester, for some remarks in Lord Mulgrave’s Essay on\r\nSatire, in the composition of which Dryden had assisted his lordship.\r\nThe king offered £50, and a free pardon, but “Black Will with a cudgel,”\r\nto whom Lord Rochester had intrusted the task of thrashing the laureate,\r\nshowed that there was such a thing as honour amongst rogues, and did not\r\nbetray him for the king’s £50. In all probability, however, he received\r\na larger sum from his lordship. In Dryden’s old age, Pope, then a boy,\r\ncame here to look at the great man whose fame in after years he was to\r\nequal if not to eclipse. This tavern was the famous mart for libels and\r\nlampoons; one Julyan, a drunken dissipated “secretary to the Muses,” as\r\nhe calls himself, was the chief manufacturer.\r\n\r\nNear Marlborough, Wilts, there is an alehouse having the sign of the RED\r\nCOW, with the following rhyme:--\r\n\r\n    “The Red Cow\r\n  Gives good Milk now.”\r\n\r\nThat under a BROWN COW at Oldham is still more sublime:--\r\n\r\n  “This Cow gives such Liquor,\r\n  ’Twould puzzle a Viccar (_sic_.)”\r\n\r\nThe Heifer is to be met with sometimes in Yorkshire, but always with\r\nsome local adjective, as the CRAVEN HEIFER; the AIRESDALE HEIFER, the\r\nDURHAM HEIFER, &c. The PIED CALF at Spalding seems to present a solitary\r\ninstance of a calf on the signboard. Neither are sheep very common; the\r\nRAM was a noted carrier’s inn in the seventeenth century, in West\r\nSmithfield, and, indeed, continued as such until the recent destruction\r\nof this old cattle market. The crest of the cloth-workers was a mount\r\nvert, thereon a ram statant; so that this sign in that locality was very\r\nwell chosen, being in honour of the cattle-dealers on ordinary\r\noccasions, and serving for the cloth-workers in the time of Bartholomew\r\nfair, for whose benefit the fair was founded. In 1668 there were two\r\nRAM’S HEAD inns in Fenchurch Street; one of them was a carriers’ inn for\r\nthe Essex people. The RAM’S SKIN, which occurs at Spalding in\r\nLincolnshire, is another name for the Fleece. The BLACK TUP figures on a\r\nsign near Rochdale, perhaps in allusion to the black ram frail matrons\r\nused to bestride in the old custom of _Free Bench_, thus related in\r\nJacob’s “Law Dictionary:”--\r\n\r\n  “In the manors of East and West-Enbourne in the Co. of Berks, and the\r\n  manor of Torre in Devonshire, and other parts of the West of England,\r\n  there is a custom, that when a Copyhold Tenant dies his widow shall\r\n  have ‘Free Bench’ in all his customary lands ‘dum sola et casta\r\n  fuerit,’ but if she commits incontinency she forfeits her estate. Yet\r\n  nevertheless on her coming into the court of the manor, riding\r\n  backwards on a _black ram_ with his tail in her hand and saying the\r\n  words following, the steward is bound by the custom to readmit her to\r\n  her free bench; The words are these:--\r\n\r\n            Here I am\r\n  Riding upon a Black Ram\r\n  Like a w----e as I am;\r\n  And for my crincum crancum\r\n  I have lost my bincum bancum;\r\n  And for my T----’s game\r\n  Have done this worldly shame.\r\n  Therefore pray, Mr Steward, let me have my land again.\r\n\r\n  This is a kind of penance among jocular tenures to purge the offence.”\r\n\r\nThough the ram is rarely, and the sheep never seen on the signboard, the\r\nLAMB is not uncommon. In 1586, it was the sign of Abraham Veale,\r\n(agreeably to the punning practices of the time, one would have expected\r\nthe _Calf_ from him,) a bookseller in St Paul’s Churchyard, and in 1728\r\nof Thomas Cox, also a bookseller, under the Royal Exchange in Cornhill.\r\nDoubtless, these signs had originally represented the Lamb with the flag\r\nof the Apocalypse. The sign was used by other trades: in 1673, it was\r\nthe distinctive ornament of a confectioner at the lower end of\r\nGracechurch Street;[266] and an instance of an alehouse is found in the\r\nfollowing advertisement, which at the same time affords us a peep at the\r\nhomely proceedings of the Admiralty in those days:--\r\n\r\n  “THIS is to give notice to the Officers and Company of His Majesty’s\r\n  Frigate Boreas, who were on Board her at the taking the Ship Vrow\r\n  Jacoba and Briggantyne Leon, that they will be paid their respective\r\n  Shares of said Prizes, on Wednesday the Eight of April next, at the\r\n  sign of _the Lamb_, in Abchurch Lane. Paying will begin at Eight\r\n  o’clock of the forenoon of the said Day.”[267]\r\n\r\nThink of that, ye clerks in Her Majesty’s offices, eight o’clock in the\r\nforenoon!\r\n\r\nA few combinations also occur, as the LAMB AND BREECHES, the sign of\r\nChurches & Christie, leather-sellers and breeches-makers, on London\r\nBridge, in the last century; this was a sign like that of the HAT AND\r\nBEAVER, in which the living animal, and the article manufactured from\r\nits skin, were juxtaposed. The LAMB AND CROWN was a sort of colonial or\r\nemigration office in Threadneedle Street, near the Southsea House in\r\n1759.[268] At the present day there is a LAMB AND LARK at Keynsham,\r\nBath, and in Printing House Lane, Blackfriars. It is a typical\r\nrepresentation of the proverb, “Go to bed with the _Lamb_ and rise with\r\nthe _Lark_.”\r\n\r\nThe LAMB AND HARE figure together in Portsmouth Place, Lower Kennington\r\nLane. The LAMB AND STILL is a combination intimating the sale of\r\ndistilled waters. It was the sign of a house in Compton Street, in 1711,\r\nwhich had the honour to lodge Mr Fert, a dancing-master, and author of\r\na work called “A Discourse or Explanation of the _ground_ of\r\nDancing.”[269]\r\n\r\nIf we except the heraldic Blue Boar, and the Sow and Pigs, we shall find\r\nno other pigs on the signboard but the PIG AND WHISTLE,[270] the LITTLE\r\nPIG at Amblecote, Stourbridge, and the HOG IN THE POUND in Oxford\r\nStreet, jocularly called the _gentleman in trouble_. This latter was\r\nformerly a starting-point for coaches, and became notorious through the\r\ncrime committed by its landlady, Catherine Hayes. Having formed an\r\nillicit connexion, she was induced by her paramour to murder her\r\nhusband, after which she cut off his head, put it in a bag, and threw it\r\nin the Thames. It floated ashore, and was put on a pole in St Margaret’s\r\nChurchyard, Westminster, in order that it might be recognised; and by\r\nthis primitive means the murderess was detected. The man was hanged, and\r\nCatherine burnt alive at Tyburn in 1726.\r\n\r\nThe GOAT is not very common; there was a Goat Inn at Hammersmith, taken\r\ndown in 1826, and rebuilt under the name of Suspension Bridge Inn; up to\r\nthat time, the sign, and the woodwork from which it was suspended, used\r\nto extend across the street. The GOAT IN BOOTS, on the Fulham Road,[271]\r\nwas in old times called simply “the Goat.” Besides these, there is a\r\nBLACK GOAT in Lincoln, and a GREY GOAT in Penrith and Carlisle, and a\r\nfew others without addition of colour.\r\n\r\nA walk through town on a fine Sunday morning will at once convince\r\nanybody of the good understanding that exists between the Englishmen and\r\nthe canine species, “l’ami de l’homme” as Buffon calls the dog. From\r\nevery lane and alley in the lower parts of the town sally forth men and\r\nyouths in clean moleskins and corduroys, each invariably accompanied by\r\nsome yelping cur, the least of whose faults is to be ugly. It is no\r\nwonder, then, that the DOG should be of frequent occurrence on the\r\nsignboard. Pepys mentions a tavern of that name in Westminster, where,\r\nabout the time of the Restoration, he used occasionally to show his\r\nmerry face. In 1768, the author of the “Art of Living in London,”\r\nrecommended the Dog in Holywell Street for a quiet good dinner:--\r\n\r\n  “Where disencumbered of all form or show,\r\n  We to a moment might or sit or go;\r\n  Eat what the palate recommends us hot,\r\n  Yet not considered as a useless guest.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.\r\n\r\nGOOSE AND GRIDIRON.\r\n\r\n(St Paul’s Churchyard, circa 1800.)\r\n\r\nANGEL AND GLOVE.\r\n\r\n(Harleian Collection, 1710.)\r\n\r\nTHREE KINGS.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1720.)\r\n\r\nMARYGOLD.\r\n\r\n(Child’s Bank, Fleet Street, circa 1670.)\r\n\r\nGUY OF WARWICK.\r\n\r\n(Roxburghe Ballads, circa 1650.)]\r\n\r\nFor some unknown reason, the BLACK DOG seems the greatest favourite;\r\nperhaps the English terrier is meant by it, a dog who “once had its\r\nday,” as the Scotch terrier appears to have it now. In the seventeenth\r\ncentury, there was a Black Dog Tavern near Newgate; a house of old\r\nstanding, of which trades tokens are yet extant.\r\n\r\nMr Akerman, in his work on “Trades Tokens issued between 1648-1672,”\r\nmakes a mistake in surmising that Luke Hutton’s “Black Dog of Newgate”\r\nhad anything to do with this tavern. That poem is simply against\r\n“coney-catchers,” _i.e._, roguish detectives or informers of the\r\nJonathan Wild stamp, and even worse. Such a one is impersonificated\r\nunder the name of the Black Dog of Newgate, because the coney-catchers\r\nused to hunt people down threatening them with Newgate. This Black Dog\r\nmay have derived its name from the canine spectre that still frightens\r\nthe ignorant and fearful in our rural districts, just as the terrible\r\nDun Cow, and the Lambton Worm were the terror of the people in old\r\ntimes. Near Lyme Regis, Dorset, there is an alehouse which has this\r\nblack fiend in all his ancient ugliness painted over the door. Its\r\nadoption there arose from a legend that the spectral black dog used to\r\nhaunt at nights the kitchen fire of a neighbouring farm-house, formerly\r\na Royalist mansion, destroyed by Cromwell’s troops. The dog would sit\r\nopposite the farmer; but one night, a little extra liquor gave the man\r\nadditional courage, and he struck at the dog, intending to rid himself\r\nof the horrid thing. Away, however, flew the dog and the farmer after\r\nhim, from one room to another, until it sprang through the roof, and was\r\nseen no more that night. In mending the hole, a lot of money fell down,\r\nwhich, of course, was connected in some way or other with the dog’s\r\nstrange visit. Near the house is a lane still called Dog Lane, which is\r\nnow the favourite walk of the black dog, and to this _genius loci_ the\r\nsign is dedicated.\r\n\r\nThere was another notorious Black Dog next door to the Devil Tavern, the\r\nshop of Abel Roper, who printed and distributed the majority of the\r\npamphlets and ballads that paved the way for the Revolution of 1688. He\r\nwas the original printer of the famous ballad of “Lillibulero.” Whatever\r\npleased the public, whether good or bad, he was always ready to provide\r\nand send into the world; he was also the editor of the newspaper called\r\nthe _Postman_. In the beginning of the reign of Charles II. he lived “at\r\nthe Sun, over against St Dunstan’s Church, in Fleet Street.”[272]\r\n\r\nTokens are extant of the PIED DOG in Seething Lane, 1667, a sign still\r\nfrequently to be seen at the present day.\r\n\r\nWe very rarely meet with the BLUE DOG; but there is an example in\r\nGrantham, and the sign occurs in a few other places.\r\n\r\nSometimes a peculiar breed is chosen, as the SETTER DOG at Redford,\r\nNotts; the POINTER at Peckfield, Milford Junction; the BEAGLE at Shute,\r\nAxminster, and the MERRY HARRIERS, common in hunting counties. Equally\r\ncommon is the GREYHOUND, particularly in the North country, where\r\ncoursing has long been a favourite sport. In the seventeenth century, it\r\nwas the sign of a fashionable tavern in London, for in a sprightly\r\nballad in the Roxburgh collection,[273] a young gallant is introduced\r\nwho is going to forsake his evil courses and turn over a new leaf. He\r\ngives a last farewell to all his _doxies_:\r\n\r\n  “Farewell unto black patches,\r\n  And farewell powder’d locks;”\r\n\r\nand remembers all those delightfully wicked places he used to haunt\r\nformerly, and amongst them:\r\n\r\n  “Farewell unto the GREYHOUND,\r\n  And farewell to the Bell,\r\n  And farewell to my landlady,\r\n  Whom I do love so well.”\r\n\r\nThis was probably the same Greyhound mentioned by Machyn, which seems to\r\nhave been situated in Fleet Street, where the gaudily dressed Spanish\r\nambassador took his stirrup-cup before leaving London. The same author\r\nmentions the sign elsewhere, apparently in Westminster; and the little\r\npicture of manners which accompanies it is rather curious:--\r\n\r\n  “The viij day of January (1557) dyd ryd in a care in Westmynster the\r\n  wyff of the Grayhound, and the Abbot’s servand was wypyd [whipped]\r\n  becawse that he toke her owt of the car, at the care h--e, [the back\r\n  of the cart.]”\r\n\r\n--another example that the course of true love never does run smooth,\r\neven though it runs upon wheels.\r\n\r\nThe WHITE GREYHOUND was the sign of John Harrison, in St Paul’s\r\nChurchyard, a bookseller who published some of Shakespeare’s early\r\nworks, as “The Rape of Lucrece,” “Venus and Adonis,” &c. White\r\ngreyhounds, or rather silver greyhounds, were, until eighty years ago,\r\nthe badges worn on the arm by king’s messengers.\r\n\r\nThe sign of the BLACK GREYHOUND is also of frequent occurrence, and at\r\nGrantham there is a BLUE GREYHOUND. Indeed, although Lincoln was\r\nformerly famous for green, it seems also to have taken a great fancy to\r\nblue, for there we find the BLUE BULL and the BLUE COW, the BLUE DOG,\r\nthe BLUE FOX, (all in Colsterworth,) besides the BLUE PIG, the BLUE RAM,\r\nin Grantham, which town can also boast of the unique sign of the BLUE\r\nMAN.\r\n\r\nThe TALBOT--old and now almost obsolete term for a large kind of hunting\r\ndog--has acquired a literary celebrity from having been substituted for\r\nthe old sign of the Tabard Inn in Southwark, whence the pilgrims started\r\non their merry journey to Canterbury. In 1606, we find the Talbot the\r\nsign of Thomas Man, bookseller in Paternoster Row, which, however, at\r\nthat time, was not such a book market as now, being occupied by “eminent\r\nmercers, silkmen, and lacemen; and their shops were so resorted unto by\r\nthe nobility and gentry in their coaches, that ofttimes the street was\r\nso stopped up, that there was no passage for foot passengers.”[274] So\r\nit continued until the fire; and it was only in the middle of the last\r\ncentury that the booksellers began to make their appearance in it.\r\n\r\nA Talbot Inn in the Strand is mentioned in the following very quaint\r\nadvertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “TO BE SOLD, a fine Grey Mare, full fifteen hands high, gone after the\r\n  hounds many times, rising six years and no more; moves as well as most\r\n  creatures upon earth, as good a road mare as any in 10 counties and 10\r\n  to that; trots at a confounded pace; is from the country, and her\r\n  owner will sell her for nine guineas; if some folks had her she would\r\n  fetch near three times the money. I have no acquaintance, and money I\r\n  want, and a service in a shop to carry parcels or to be in a\r\n  gentleman’s service. My father gave me the mare to get rid of me, and\r\n  to try my fortune in London, and I am just come from Shropshire, and I\r\n  can be recommended, as I suppose nobody takes servants without, and\r\n  have a voucher for my mare. Enquire for me at the Talbot Inn near the\r\n  New Church at the Strand.\r\n\r\n  “A. R.”[275]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of Burdley’s Hill, Gloucester, there is a Talbot Inn, which\r\nhas a sign painted with two inscriptions; at the side where the road is\r\nlevel, it says:--\r\n\r\n  “Before you do this hill go up,\r\n  Stop and drink a cheerful cup.”\r\n\r\nOn the side of the hill it says:\r\n\r\n  “You’re down the hill, all danger’s past,\r\n  Stop and drink a cheerful glass.”\r\n\r\nA publican at Odell has chosen the MAD DOG for a sign, evidently his\r\n_beau ideal_ of a “jolly fellow,” one having a great horror for water;\r\nanother at Pidley, Hunts, not to be behindhand with the Mad Dog, has put\r\nup the MAD CAT. We have as odd and apparently as unmeaning a sign in\r\nTabernacle Walk, namely, the BARKING DOGS.\r\n\r\nAll the combinations of the sign of the Dog point towards sports, as the\r\nDOG AND BEAR, which was very common in the seventeenth century, when\r\nbear-baiting was in fashion, and kings and queens countenanced it by\r\ntheir presence. The DOG AND DUCK refers to another barbarous pastime,\r\nwhen ducks were hunted in a pond by spaniels. The pleasure consisted in\r\nseeing the duck make her escape from the dog’s mouth by diving. It was\r\nmuch practised in the neighbourhood of London till the beginning of this\r\ncentury, when it went out of fashion, as most of the ponds were\r\ngradually built over. One of the most notorious DOG AND DUCK Taverns\r\nstood in St George’s Fields, where Bethlem Hospital now stands; it had a\r\nlong room with tables and benches, and an organ[276] at the upper end.\r\nIn its last days it was frequented only by thieves, prostitutes, and\r\nother low characters. After a long and wicked existence it was at length\r\nput down by the magistrates. In the seventeenth century it was famous\r\nfor springs, but already in Garrick’s time its reputation was very\r\nequivocal:\r\n\r\n  “St George’s Fields, with taste and fashion struck,\r\n  Display Arcadia at the _Dog and Duck_,\r\n  And Drury Misses, here in tawdry pride,\r\n  Are there “Pastoras” by the fountain side;\r\n  To frowsy bowers they reel through midnight damps,\r\n  With Fauns half drunk and Dryads breaking lamps.”[277]\r\n\r\nIn an unpublished paper from the MS. collection of William Hone, we have\r\na mention of it:--\r\n\r\n  “It was a very small public-house till Hedger’s mother took it, who\r\n  had been a barmaid to a tavern-keeper in London, who left this house\r\n  to her at his death. Her son Hedger then was a postboy to a yard I\r\n  believe at Epsom, and came to be master there. After making a good\r\n  deal of money he left the house to his nephew, one Miles, (though it\r\n  still went in Hedger’s name,) who was to allow him £1000 per annum out\r\n  of the profits, and it was he that allowed the house to acquire so\r\n  bad a character that the licence was taken away. I have this from one\r\n  William Nelson who was servant to old Mrs Hedger, and remembers the\r\n  house before he had it. He is now [1826] in the employ of the Lamb\r\n  Street Water Works Company, and has been for thirty years. In\r\n  particular, there never was any duck hunting since he knew the\r\n  Gardens. Therefore, if ever, it must have been in a very early time\r\n  indeed. Hedger, I am told, was the first person who sold the mineral\r\n  water, (whence the St George’s Spa.) In 1787, when Hedger applied for\r\n  a renewal of his licence, the magistrates of Surrey refused, and the\r\n  Lord Mayor came into Southwark and held a court and granted the\r\n  licence, in despite of the magistrates, which occasioned a great\r\n  disturbance and litigation in the law courts.”\r\n\r\nThe old stone sign is still preserved, embedded in the brick wall of the\r\ngarden of Bethlehem Hospital, visible from the road, and representing a\r\ndog squatted on his haunches, with a duck in his mouth, and the date\r\n1617.\r\n\r\nAnother famous Dog and Duck inn formerly stood on the site of Hertford\r\nStreet, in the now aristocratic precincts of May Fair. It was an\r\nold-fashioned wooden public-house, extensively patronised by the\r\nbutchers and other rough characters during May Fair time. The pond in\r\nwhich the cruel sport took place was situated behind the house, and for\r\nthe benefit of the spectators was boarded round to the height of the\r\nknee, to preserve the over-excited spectators from involuntary\r\nimmersions. The pond was surrounded by a gravel walk shaded with willow\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nTHE DOG AND BADGER, Kingswood, Gloucester, refers to the now obsolete\r\nsport of badger-baiting. More genial sports, however, are called to mind\r\nby the DOG AND GUN, DOG AND PARTRIDGE, DOG AND PHEASANT, all of which\r\nare very common.\r\n\r\n“As I was going through a street of London, where I never had been till\r\nthen, I felt a general clamp and faintness all over me, which I could\r\nnot tell how to account for, till I chanced to cast my eyes upwards and\r\nfound that I was passing under a signpost on which the picture of a\r\n_cat_ was hung.” This little incident of the cat-hater, told in No. 538\r\nof the _Spectator_, is a proof of the presence of cats on the signboard,\r\nwhere, indeed, they are still to be met with, but very rarely. There is\r\na sign of the CAT at Egremont, in Cumberland, a BLACK CAT at St\r\nLeonard’s Gate, Lancaster, and a RED CAT at Birkenhead. There is also a\r\nsign of the Red Cat in the Hague, Holland, and “thereby hangs a tale.”\r\nIt was put up by a certain Bertrand, a Frenchman, who had left his\r\nnative country, having been mixed up in some conspiracy against Mazarin.\r\nArrived at the Hague, he opened a cutler’s shop, and put up a double\r\nsign, representing on the one side a red cat, on the other a portrait of\r\nhis Eminence Cardinal Mazarin in his red gown, and with his bristling\r\nmoustache; underneath he wrote “_aux deux méchantes bêtes_” (the two\r\nobnoxious animals.) Holland, however, was at peace with France at that\r\ntime, and so the Burgomaster, afraid of offending the French ambassador,\r\nrequested Bertrand to alter his sign. Mazarin’s face was then painted\r\nout and another red cat put in its place. Gradually as the first sign\r\nwas forgotten, the name became unmeaning, and was finally altered into\r\nthe Red Cat, and in this shape it has come down to the present day,\r\nstill the sign of a cutler, and a descendant of Bertrand.[278]\r\n\r\nThe CAT AND LION, which we meet with sometimes, as at Stockport, was\r\nprobably at one time the Tiger and Lion. It is occasionally accompanied\r\nby the following elegant distich:--\r\n\r\n  “The lion is strong, the cat is vicious,\r\n  My ale is strong, and so is my liquors.”\r\n\r\nThe CAT AND PARROT was, in 1612, the sign of Thomas Pauer, a bookseller,\r\ndwelling near the Royal Exchange. At Santry, near Dublin, and in some\r\nother places, we meet with the CAT AND CAGE, which is represented by a\r\ncat trying to pull a bird out of a cage; but its origin may be found in\r\nthe CAT IN THE BASKET, a favourite sign of the booths on the Thames when\r\nthat river was frozen over in 1739/40. The sign was a living one, a\r\nbasket hanging outside the booth, with a cat in it. It was revived when\r\nthe river was again frozen in 1789, and seems to have had many\r\nimitators, for on a print[279] representing a view of the river at\r\nRotherithe during the frost, there is a booth with a merry company\r\nwithin, whose sign, inscribed the _Original_ CAT IN THE CAGE, represents\r\npoor Tabby in a basket. This sign of the Cat in the Basket, or in the\r\nCage, doubtless originated from the cruel game, once practised by our\r\nancestors, of shooting at a cat in a basket. Brand, in his “Popular\r\nSuperstitions,” gives a quotation, from which it appears that a similar\r\ncruel sport was still practised at Kelso in 1789; but instead of\r\nshooting at the cat, it was placed in a barrel, the bottom of which had\r\nto be beaten out. The same game is still practised in Holland, and\r\ngenerally, if not always, on the ice.\r\n\r\n[196] J.

Speaking of the bridges over the\r\nSeine, he says one of them is “the Bridge of Birdes, formerly called the\r\nMillar’s Bridge. The reason why it is called the Bridge of Birdes is\r\nbecause all the signes belonging unto shops on each side of the streete\r\nare signes of birdes.”[280] They never were so general in England,\r\nthough certainly the Cock and the Swan appear to have found more\r\nvotaries than any other signboard animals. The EAGLE is not nearly so\r\ncommon; some we have mentioned in a former part as undoubtedly of\r\n_heraldic_ origin. From this source the GOLDEN EAGLE may be derived; it\r\nwas the emblem of the Eastern Empire, and occurs in various family arms;\r\nbut it is also a _fera naturæ_. It was, in 1711, the sign of James Levi,\r\na bookseller in the Strand, near the Fountain Tavern. The EAGLE AND\r\nBALL, of which there are two in Birmingham, was suggested by the\r\nimperial eagle standing on the globe, or the spread eagle with the globe\r\nin his talon. The EAGLE AND SERPENT, or the EAGLE AND SNAKE, is a\r\nmediæval emblem of courage united to prudence.\r\n\r\nMythical birds also have been in great favour. The burning and reviving\r\nof the PHŒNIX, for instance, like the salamander and the dragon,\r\ntypified certain transformations obtained by chemistry, whence he was a\r\nvery general sign with chemists, and may still be seen on their\r\ndrug-pots and transparent lamps. The firm of Godfrey and Cooke, for\r\ninstance, have adhered to it ever since the opening of their\r\nestablishment, A.D. 1680. Persons of a highly imaginative turn will\r\nprobably shudder to think of the awful quantities of physic prepared by\r\nthis house in those 184 years. The pills, if piled up like cannon-balls,\r\nwould make pyramids higher than those of Gizeh; the draughts would be\r\nsufficient to cover the earth with a nauseous deluge; and the powders,\r\nif blown about by an evil wind, levelling valleys and mountains, would\r\nchange the whole of Europe into a medicated desert. The original shop\r\nreferred to by the date 1680 stood in Southampton Street, and there\r\nphosphorus was first manufactured by the predecessor of this firm,\r\nHanckwitz, a Pole or Russian by birth, who advertised it wholesale at\r\n50s., and retail at £3 the ounce. Ambrose Godfrey was his successor.\r\n\r\nNot only apothecaries used this emblem, but all kinds of shops adopted\r\nit. In the time of James I. it was the sign of one of the places where\r\nplays were acted in Drury Lane,--sometimes also called the Cockpit\r\nTheatre. This was destroyed by the unruly apprentices during one of\r\ntheir saturnalia. Being rebuilt, it was sacked a second time by the\r\nParliamentary soldiers. In Charles II.’s piping times of peace\r\nKilligrew’s troop of “the king’s servants” played in it, until they\r\nremoved to the theatre in Lincoln’s Inn.\r\n\r\nThe character ascribed to the PELICAN was fully as fabulous as that of\r\nthe Phœnix. From a clumsy, gluttonous, piscivorous water-bird, it was\r\ntransformed into a mystic emblem of Christ, whom Dante calls “nostro\r\nPellicano.” St Hieronymus gives the story of the pelican restoring its\r\nyoung ones destroyed by serpents, as an illustration of the destruction\r\nof man by the old serpent, and his salvation by the blood of Christ. The\r\n“Bestiarium,” in the Royal Library at Brussels, says:--\r\n\r\n  “Phisiologus dist del Pellican qu’il aime moult ses oiseles et quant\r\n  ils sont nés et creu ils s’esbanoient en lor ni contre lor pere et le\r\n  fierent de lors eles en ventilant ensi come il li vont entor et tant\r\n  le fierent qu’ils le blechent es ex. Et lors les refiert li peres et\r\n  les occit. Et la mere est de tel nature que ele vient al ni al tierc\r\n  jor et s’accoste sor ses oiselès mors et ell oevre son costé de son\r\n  bec et en espant son sanc sor ses oiseles et ensi les resucite de\r\n  mort; car li oiseles par nature rechoivent le sang si toit come il\r\n  saut de la mere et le boivent.”[281]\r\n\r\nIn the Armory of Birds by Skelton, a similar notion is expressed:\r\n\r\n  “Than sayd the Pellycane,\r\n  When my Byrdts be slayne,\r\n  With my Bloude I them reuyue,\r\n    Scrypture doth record\r\n    The same dyd our Lord,\r\n  And rose from deth to lyue.”\r\n\r\nThere is still an old stone carving of the Pelican walled in the front\r\nof a house in Aldermanbury, and as a sign the bird appears to be a great\r\nfavourite at the present day. An anecdote is told of Jekyl’s\r\ndissatisfaction at the prices at the Pelican Inn, Speenham Land, and of\r\nhis writing the following epigram upon the same:--\r\n\r\n  “The Pelican at Speenhamland,\r\n    That stands below the hill,\r\n  May well be called the Pelican,\r\n    From his enormous _bill_.”\r\n\r\nLongfellow made a similar epigram on the RAVEN INN at Zurich:--\r\n\r\n  “Beware of the raven of Zurich,\r\n    ’Tis a bird of omen ill,\r\n  With a noisy and unclean breast,\r\n    And a very, very long _bill_.”\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to see how wit runs in the same channel. In “Scrapeana, a\r\nCollection of Anecdotes, 1792,” a similar anecdote is fathered upon\r\nFoote. “Pray what is your name?” said Foote to the Master of the Castle\r\nInn at Salthill. “Partridge, sir!”--“Partridge! it should be Woodcock by\r\nthe length of your _bill_!”\r\n\r\nBut the coincidence is most amusing in the case of Longfellow. It is\r\nobserved by a contributor to _Notes and Queries_,[282] that the verses\r\nmay be a plagiarism; at any rate they have a strange _family_\r\nresemblance to the following, said to have been written by a commercial\r\ntraveller on an inside window shutter of the GOLDEN LION, Brecon, kept\r\nby a Mr Longfellow, alias Tom Longfellow:--\r\n\r\n  “Tom Longfellow’s name is most justly his due,\r\n  Long his neck, long his _bill_, which is very long too;\r\n  Long the time ere your horse to the stable is led,\r\n  Long before he’s rubbed down, and much longer till fed.\r\n  Long indeed may you sit in a comfortless room,\r\n  Till from kitchen, long dirty, your dinners shall come.\r\n  Long the often-told tale that your host will relate,\r\n  Long his face while complaining how long people eat,\r\n  Long may Longfellow long ere he see me again,\r\n  Long ’twill be ere I long for Tom Longfellow’s inn.”\r\n\r\nAnd long, doubtless, was his face when he read the above.\r\n\r\nThe RAVEN, or the BLACK RAVEN, is still a common inn sign. There is one\r\nin Bishopsgate yet in existence, of which trades tokens of the\r\nseventeenth century are extant; and on the Great Western Road between\r\nMurrell Green and Basingstoke, the Raven Inn is still, or was not many\r\nyears ago, to be seen, in which Jack the painter, alias James Aitken,\r\nthe man who set fire to Portsmouth Dockyard, Dec. 7, 1776, was taken\r\nprisoner. This house was built in 1653, and has preserved much of its\r\noriginal appearance. In 1711 the RAVEN or the BLACK RAVEN was the sign\r\nof S. Popping, bookseller in Paternoster Row; and about the same time\r\nJohn Dunton published at the BLACK RAVEN, in the Poultry, the earliest\r\nprinted review of literary works, under the name of “Literature from the\r\nNorth, and News from all Nations.” What the work was worth we may judge\r\nfrom D’Israeli’s description of the man: “a crack-brained, scribbling\r\nbookseller, who boasted he had a thousand projects, fancied he had\r\nmethodised six hundred, and was ruined by the fifty he executed.”\r\nNotwithstanding this, his autobiography, under the name of the “Life and\r\nErrors of John Dunton,” is one of the most curious works in existence.\r\nIn Molesworth Street, Dublin, there is a sign of the THREE RAVENS, which\r\nmay be called a living sign, for there are always some ravens kept on\r\nthe premises. The Raven was the badge of the old Scotch kings, and thus\r\nmay have been adopted as a kind of Jacobite symbol. To this may be\r\nattributed its frequency on the signboard as well as some other sable\r\nbirds. The common occurrence of the BLACKBIRD and the COCK AND BLACKBIRD\r\nas signs had long puzzled us, till one day turning over some old Scotch\r\nballads we came upon one, which Allan Ramsay gives as a favourite old\r\nScotch song. We shall merely quote the first two stanzas, (there are six\r\nin all,)--quite sufficient, as far as the poetry is concerned:--\r\n\r\n  “Upon a fair morning for soft recreation,\r\n    I heard a fair lady was making her moan,\r\n  With sighing and sobbing, and sad lamentation,\r\n    Saying, _my blackbird most royal_ is flown.”\r\n          My thoughts they deceive me,\r\n          Reflections do grieve me,\r\n  And am o’erburthen’d with sad misery.\r\n          Yet if death should blind me,\r\n          As true love inclines me,\r\n  My blackbird I’ll seek out wherever he be.\r\n\r\n  “Once in fair England my blackbird did flourish,\r\n    He was the _chief blackbird that in it did spring_,\r\n  Prime ladies of honour his person did nourish,\r\n    _Because he was the true son of a king_.\r\n          But since that false fortune,\r\n          Which still is uncertain,\r\n  Has caused this parting between him and me,\r\n          His name I’ll advance,\r\n          In Spain and in France,\r\n  And I’ll seek out my blackbird wherever he be.”\r\n\r\nTo which dark-haired prince of the Stuart family the song alludes is not\r\nknown; but there is a passage in a letter of Sir John Hinton, physician\r\nto Charles II., which seems to imply that the black boy was a nickname\r\nfor Charles II.\r\n\r\n  “The day before General Monk went into Scotland he dined with me; and\r\n  after dinner he called me into the next room, and after some\r\n  discourse, taking a lusty glass of wine, he drank a health to his\r\n  _bonny black boy_, (as he called Your Majesty,) and whispered to me,\r\n  that if ever he had power, he would serve Your Majesty to the utmost\r\n  of his life.”[283]\r\n\r\nWhat lends strength to the supposition is the occurrence of such a sign\r\nas the CROW IN THE OAK, at Foleshill, Coventry, which seems to have been\r\na covert way of representing the royal oak during the times of the\r\nCommonwealth, the disguise continuing after there was no more need of\r\nit, similar to the “Cat and Wheel,” and other signs dating from the same\r\nperiod, for no other reason than because the house had become known by\r\nthem. In the same manner the OAK AND BLACK DOG, (at Stretton on\r\nDunsmoor,) if not a combination of two signs, may have been put up in\r\nderision of the Prince in the Royal Oak. The CROW or the BLACK CROW, is\r\nalso a common sign; so are the THREE BLACKBIRDS;[284] then there is the\r\nCHOUGH, at Chard in Sommerset, the THREE CHOUGHS at Yeovil; the THREE\r\nCROWS,--all of which belong to the same family, and seem to have the\r\nsame origin.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, August 27, 1770, at the Three Crows in Brook Street, Holborn,\r\nthe coroner sat on the body of Thomas Chatterton, and the ten jurymen\r\nreturned a verdict of _felo de se_. One cannot think of this sign and\r\nthe _crowner_ (as the vulgar still term this officer) _sitting on the\r\nbody_ of poor Chatterton without calling to mind the ballad of the three\r\ncorbies; but the poor suicide had no “fallow doe” that\r\n\r\n        “buried him before the prime,\r\n  And was dead herself ere even-song time.”\r\n\r\nHe was interred in the burying ground of Shoelane workhouse; at the\r\npresent day Farringdon market-place occupies the spot.\r\n\r\nThe STORK now is of frequent occurrence, although it does not occur\r\namong the older English signs. Coryatt thus speaks of these birds:--\r\n\r\n  “There, [at Fontainebleau] I saw two or three birds that I never saw\r\n  before; yet I have much read of admirable things of them, in Aelianus\r\n  the Polyhistor, and other historians, even _Storckes_, which do much\r\n  haunt many cities and towns of the Netherlands, especially in the\r\n  sommer. For in Flushing, a towne of Zeland, I saw some of them, those\r\n  men esteeming themselves happy in [on] whose houses they harbour, and\r\n  those most unhappy whom they forsake. It is written of them that when\r\n  the old one is become so old that it is not able to helpe itselfe, the\r\n  young one purveyeth foode for it, and sometime carryeth it about on\r\n  his backe, and if it seeth it so destitute of meate, that it knoweth\r\n  not where to get any sustenance, it casteth out that which it hath\r\n  eaten the day before, to the end to feede his damme. This bird is\r\n  called in Greeke πελαργος where hence cometh the Greeke word\r\n  αντιπελαργειν which signifieth to imitate the stork in cherishing our\r\n  parents.”[285]\r\n\r\nThis fabled virtue of the stork suggested the sign to many Continental\r\nbooksellers and printers. The TWO STORKS was the sign of Martin Nutius\r\nof Antwerp, 1550, and his son, Philip Nutius. Their colophons, which\r\nwere varied continually, all represent a young stork feeding an old one,\r\nsometimes carrying him on his back, with the motto: “PIETAS HOMINI .\r\nTUTISSIMA . VIRTUS.” A similar sign was used, _circa_ 1682, by\r\nFranciscus Canisius; and, in 1651, by Joan. Bapt. Verdussen, both of\r\nAntwerp. The Parisian booksellers adopted it as well, for we find it on\r\nthe titlepages of Sebastien Nivelle, and of Sebastien Cramoisy, the\r\nking’s printer, of the Rue St Jacques, 1636. He used a Scripture motto\r\nwith it: “HONORA PATREM TUUM ET MATREM TUAM UT SIS LONGAEVUS SUPER\r\nTERRAM, _Ecc._ XX.” In the Banks’ Collection of Bills there is one of\r\nthe STORK HOTEL at Basle, of the end of the last century. It gives the\r\naddress in four languages. The English stands thus:--Christophe Imhoff,\r\n“a the Seigne off the Storgk at Basel.”\r\n\r\nThe THREE CRANES was formerly a favourite London sign. With the usual\r\njocularity of our forefathers, an opportunity for punning could not be\r\npassed, so instead of the three cranes, which in the vintry used to lift\r\nthe barrels of wine, three birds were represented. The Three Cranes in\r\nThames Street, or in the vicinity, was a famous tavern as early as the\r\nreign of James I. It was one of the taverns frequented by the wits in\r\nBen Jonson’s time. In one of his plays he says:--\r\n\r\n  “A pox o’ these pretenders to wit, your _Three Cranes_, Mitre and\r\n  Mermaid men! not a corn of true salt, not a grain of right mustard\r\n  among them all!”--_Bartholomew Fair_, a. i. s. 1.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of January 1661/2, Pepys suffered a strong mortification of\r\nthe flesh in having to dine at this tavern with some poor relations. The\r\nsufferings of the snobbish secretary must have been intense:--\r\n\r\n  “By invitation to my uncle Fenner’s and where I found his new wife, a\r\n  _pitiful, old, ugly, ill-bred_ woman in a hatt, a midwife. Here were\r\n  many of his and as many of her relations, _sorry mean people_; and\r\n  after choosing our gloves we all went over to the Three Cranes\r\n  Taverne, and though the best room of the house in such a narrow\r\n  dogghole we were crammed, and I believe we were near 40, that it made\r\n  me loath my company and victuals and a very poor dinner it was too.”\r\n\r\nOpposite this tavern people generally left their boats to shoot the\r\nbridge, walking round to Billingsgate, where they would re-enter them.\r\n\r\nThe COCK occurs almost as frequently on the signboard as alive at the\r\nhead of his family in the farm yard. It is one of the oldest signs,\r\nalready in use at the time of the Romans, who record that one Eros, a\r\nfreeman of Licius, Africanus Cerealis, kept an inn at Narbonne at the\r\nsign of the Cock--“a gallo gallinaceo.” In Christian times the sign\r\nacquired a new prestige. The cock is thus mentioned in “The Armory of\r\nByrdes:”--[286]\r\n\r\n  “The Cocke dyd say\r\n    I use alway\r\n  To crow both first and last.\r\n    Lyke a Postle I am,\r\n    For I preche to Man,\r\n  And tell hym the nyght is past.\r\n\r\n  “I bring new tydynges\r\n  That the Kyng of all Kynges,\r\n  In tactu profudit chorus:\r\n    Then sang he mellodious\r\n    Te Gloriosus\r\n  Apostolorum chorus.”\r\n\r\nThis bird, in the legends of the middle ages, was surrounded with a\r\nmystical, religious halo:--\r\n\r\n  “It was about the time of cock-crowing when our Saviour was born,--the\r\n  circumstance of the time of cock-crowing being so natural a figure and\r\n  representation of the Morning of the Resurrection; the Night as\r\n  shadowing out the night of the Grave; the third Watch being as some\r\n  suppose the time our Saviour will come to judgment at; the noise of\r\n  the cock awakening sleepy man and telling him as it were the night is\r\n  far spent, and the day is at hand, representing so naturally the voice\r\n  of the Archangel awakening the dead and calling up the righteous to\r\n  everlasting day; so naturally does the time of cock-crowing shadow\r\n  out these things, that probably, some good, well meaning men might\r\n  have been brought to believe that the very devils themselves when the\r\n  cock crew and reminded them of them did fear and tremble and shun the\r\n  light.”[287]\r\n\r\nIdeas such as these continued a long time in the popular mind, for\r\nAubrey tells us that in his younger days people “had some pious\r\nejaculation too when the cock did crow, which put them in mind of y^{e}\r\nTrumpet at y^{e} Resurrection.”[288]\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest Cock taverns in London is the COCK in Tothill Street,\r\nWestminster, lately re-christened as the COCK AND TABARD. An ancient\r\ncoat of arms, carved in stone, England quartered with France, discovered\r\nin this house, is now walled up in the front of the building. In the\r\nback parlour is a jolly, bluff-looking man in a red coat, said to\r\nrepresent the driver of the first mail to Oxford, which started from\r\nthis tavern. Tradition says that the workmen employed at the building of\r\nWestminster Abbey, in the reign of Henry VII., used to receive their\r\nwages at this house. It was formerly entered by steps; the building now\r\nexhibiting traces of great antiquity, and appears at one time to have\r\nbeen a house of considerable pretensions. The rafters and timber are\r\nprincipally of cedar wood. There is a curious hiding-place on the\r\nstaircase, and a massive carving of Abraham about to offer his son\r\nIsaac; and another, in wood, representing the Adoration of the Magi,\r\nsaid to have been left in pledge, at some remote period, for an unpaid\r\nscore. The cock may have been adopted as a sign here on account of the\r\nvicinity of the Abbey, of which St Peter was the patron, for in the\r\nmiddle ages a cock crowing on the top of a pillar was often one of the\r\naccessories in a picture of the apostle. This certainly was a very\r\nunkind allusion for the poor saint, particularly when accompanied with\r\nsuch a sneering rhyme as that under the sign of the Red Cock in\r\nAmsterdam in 1682. On the one side was written:--\r\n\r\n  “Doe de Haan begost te kraayen\r\n  Toen begost Petrus te schraayen.”\r\n\r\nOn the reverse:--\r\n\r\n  “De haan die kraait niet by ongeval\r\n  Vraagt Petrus die ’t U zeggen zal.”[289]\r\n\r\nThe Cock in Bow Street witnessed a disgraceful scene in the reign of\r\nCharles II.:--\r\n\r\n  “Sackville, who was then Lord Buckhurst, with Sir Charles Sedley and\r\n  Sir Thomas Ogle, got drunk at the Cock, in Bow Street, by Covent\r\n  Garden, and going into the balcony, exposed themselves to the public,\r\n  in very indecent postures. At last, as they grew warmer, Sedley stood\r\n  forth naked, and harangued the populace in such profane language, that\r\n  the public indignation was awakened. The crowd attempted to force the\r\n  door, and being repulsed, drove in the performers with stones, and\r\n  broke the windows of the house. For this demeanour they were indicted,\r\n  and Sedley was fined £500. What was the sentence of the others is not\r\n  known. Sedley employed Killigrew and another to procure a remission of\r\n  the king, but (mark the friendship of the dissolute!) they begged the\r\n  fine for themselves and exacted it to the last groat.”[290]\r\n\r\nIt was on his way home from supper at this house, December 21, 1670,\r\nthat Sir John Coventry was attacked by several men, and had his nose cut\r\nto the bone. Sir John had remonstrated in the House of Commons against\r\nthe improper distribution of public money, and proposed to lay a tax on\r\nthe theatres; this was opposed by the Court, the players being “the\r\nking’s servants and a part of his pleasure;” upon which Sir John asked\r\n“whether the king’s pleasure lay among the men or among the women that\r\nacted?” The assault was committed by Simon Parry, Miles Reeves, O’Brian,\r\nand Sir Thomas Sandys, instigated by the Duke of Monmouth.\r\n\r\nPepys much praises the Cock in Suffolk Street:--\r\n\r\n  “15th March 1669.--Mr Hewes and I did walke to the Cocke, at the end\r\n  of Suffolke Street, where I never was, a great ordinary mightily cried\r\n  up, and there bespoke a pullet, which, while dressing, he and I walked\r\n  into St James’s Park, and thence back and dined very handsome with a\r\n  good soup and a pullet for 4s. 6d. the whole.”\r\n\r\nThis first visit evidently had given great satisfaction, for, three\r\nweeks after, he took Mrs P. and some friends there, and was, as usual,\r\n“mighty merry, this house being famous for good meat, and particularly\r\npease porridge.”\r\n\r\nAt the same period there was another celebrated Cock Tavern in Fleet\r\nStreet, near Temple Bar, properly called the COCK AND BOTTLE, a sign\r\nstill of daily occurrence, which seems to be a figurative rendering of\r\nliquor _on draught and in bottle_, cock being an old English, and still\r\nprovincial word for the spigot or tap in a barrel.[291] The sign is,\r\nhowever, generally represented by a cock standing on a bottle. The\r\npresent sign of the house, still conspicuous in gilt over the door, is\r\nsaid to have been carved by no less a hand than Grinling Gibbons. During\r\nthe plague time of 1665, the following advertisement appeared in the\r\n_Intelligencer_:--\r\n\r\n  “THIS is to certify that the Master of the _Cock and Bottle_, commonly\r\n  called the _Cock_ alehouse, at Temple Bar, hath dismissed his servants\r\n  and shut up his house for this long vacation, intending (God willing)\r\n  to return at Michaelmass next so that all persons who have any\r\n  accounts or farthings belonging to the said house are desired to\r\n  repair thither before the 8th of this instant July and they shall\r\n  receive satisfaction.”\r\n\r\nCertainly those were dull times, and well might that fashionable\r\nestablishment close for the “long vacation,” for the plague was then\r\ncoming to its highest pitch; all the gallant customers had fled town,\r\nand according to Defoe’s computation, “not less than 10,000 houses were\r\nforsaken of the inhabitants in the city and suburbs:”--\r\n\r\n  “There was not so much velvet stirring as would have bene a cover to a\r\n  little booke in octavo, or seamde a Lieftenant’s Buff-doublet; a\r\n  French hood would have been more wondered at in London, than the\r\n  Polonyans with their long-tayld Gaberdynes; and, which was most\r\n  lamentable, there was never a Gilt spur to be seene all the Strand\r\n  over, never a feather wagging in all Fleet Streete, vnlesse some\r\n  country Fore-horse came by, by meere chaunce with a Raine-beaten\r\n  Feather in his costrill; the streete looking for all the world like a\r\n  Sunday morning at six o’Clocke, three hours before service, and the\r\n  Bells ringing all about London, as if the Coronation day had beene a\r\n  half a yeare long.”[292]\r\n\r\nBut there was a good time coming after the plague and fire, when troops\r\nof gay courtiers might quaff their wine and sparkling ale, as happy as\r\nthe “merry monarch” himself. Amongst them, our friend Pepys, who informs\r\nus, that on the 23d of April 1668, he went “by water to the Temple, and\r\nthen to the Cock alehouse, and drank and eat a lobster, and sang, and\r\nmighty merry. So almost night, I carried Mrs Pierce home, and then Knipp\r\nand I to the Temple again and took boat, it being darkish, and to\r\nFoxhall, it being now night, and a bonfire burning at Lambeth for the\r\nking’s coronation day.”\r\n\r\nExactly one hundred years later, the Cock is named with encomiums on its\r\nporter, in the “Art of Living in London;” but it is to be hoped the\r\nporter was better than the poetry:--\r\n\r\n  “Nor think the Cock with these not on a par,\r\n  The celebrated Cock of Temple Bar,\r\n  Whose Porter best of all bespeaks its praise,\r\n  Porter that’s worthy of the Poet’s lays.”[293]\r\n\r\nIn William Waterproof’s Monologue, the fame of a waiter of this tavern\r\nis handed down to posterity in the harmonious verses of the Poet\r\nLaureate.\r\n\r\nJackson the pugilist, who has a pompous epitaph on his grave in the\r\nBrompton burial-ground, kept for some time the Cock alehouse, Sutton, on\r\nthe Epsom Road; but being patronised by the Prince of Wales and a great\r\nmany of the leading members of the “nobility and gentry,” he was in a\r\nvery short time enabled to retire with a £10,000 fortune. Finally, some\r\ntwenty years ago, there was a Cock and Bottle public-house in Bristol\r\nkept by a man named John England, who added to his sign the well known\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n  “England expects every man to do his duty.”\r\n\r\nThe sign of the THREE COCKS occurs in the following advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “ALL persons that have any Household Goods, Plate, Rings, Watches,\r\n  Jewels, Wearing Apparel, etc., in the hands of Thomas Bastin, at the\r\n  THREE COCKS in St John’s Lane, Pawnbroker, which were pledged to him\r\n  before the 25th of December 1709, are desired to fetch them away by\r\n  the 25th of March next, or they will be disposed off.”--_London\r\n  Gazette_, Jan. 18-21, 1711.\r\n\r\nFrom this and innumerable other similar advertisements, it appears that\r\npawnbrokers in those days did not always rigorously adhere to the Three\r\nBalls; that is to say, they were occasionally goldsmiths, and in that\r\ncapacity used any sign.\r\n\r\nIt is rarely that the sign of the Cock designates any particular colour.\r\nThere is a BLACK COCK in Owen Street, Tipton; a cock of this colour was\r\nalways considered something more than an ordinary bird; with the Greeks\r\nit was a grateful sacrifice to Esculapius and Pluto, and in the middle\r\nages it played a prominent part in matters of witchcraft. The BLUE COCK\r\nis a sign at Leicester; but neither colour is common. At Hargrave, near\r\nBury St Edmunds, there is a COCK’S HEAD, put up either in imitation of a\r\nnag’s,--bull’s,--bear’s,--or boar’s head, or as the crest of a fool’s\r\ncap, which, in old times, usually terminated with a cock’s head.\r\n\r\nThough some sort of religious prestige may at first have prompted the\r\nchoice of the cock, more profane ideas latterly contributed to make it\r\npopular, such as the pastimes of cock-throwing, or “shying,” and\r\ncock-fighting. To this first practice alludes the sign of William\r\nBrandon, on Dowgate Hill, which was called, HAVE AT IT; his token\r\nrepresenting a man about to throw a stick at a cock. This cruel game was\r\nvery common in alehouses in former times; the whole sport consisting in\r\nthrowing a stick at an unfortunate cock tied to a stake; if the animal\r\nwas killed it was the thrower’s property; if not, he forfeited the small\r\nsum paid for each “shy.” What a slaughter of cocks was carried on in\r\nthis way may be judged from the following:--\r\n\r\n  “Last Tuesday a Brewer’s servant in Southwark took his walk round\r\n  Towerhill, Moorfield, and Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and knocked down so\r\n  many cocks that by selling them again, he returned home twenty\r\n  shillings odd pence richer man than he came out.”[294]\r\n\r\nMedals are extant of the reign of William III., on which John Bull is\r\nrepresented throwing sticks at the French cock: not a very lofty\r\nallegory, it must be confessed; but in those days the public taste was\r\nnot very refined; thus, after the victory of Blenheim, the simile was in\r\nequal bad taste, the same idea being expressed by a huge lion tearing an\r\nunfortunate cock in pieces.\r\n\r\nCock-fighting was a favourite diversion with the Romans, and we find\r\ncontinual traces of it during their occupation here. Fitz-Stephen says,\r\nit was the sport of schoolboys in his time; but as they grew up it seems\r\nthe taste adhered to them. That sturdy bluebeard-king, Henry VIII.,\r\nthough always ready to chop off the heads of his subjects, felt his\r\nheart melt at the miseries of the cocks, and made edicts against\r\ncock-fights, yet with the inconsistency that marked his other tastes\r\nbuilt a cock-pit unto himself at Whitehall. James I., also, was a great\r\namateur. Though habitually suppressed by various sovereigns, the evil\r\nwould always break out again, till it was finally abolished by an Act of\r\nParliament in the 12 & 13 Queen Victoria. In Staffordshire, and other\r\ncounties where this sport is still practised “on the sly,” the FIGHTING\r\nCOCKS is a favourite sign.\r\n\r\nThe cock occurs in innumerable combinations with all kinds of\r\nheterogeneous objects, many of which seem merely selected for their\r\noddity: among the most explicable is the Cock and Bottle, of which we\r\nhave offered a solution, (p. 207) and which again occurs in the\r\nfollowing title:--\r\n\r\n  “JUST PUBLISHED,\r\n\r\n  “A full account of the Life and Visions of Nicholas Hart who has every\r\n  year in his Life past, on the 5th of August, fall’n into a Deep Sleep\r\n  and cannot be awaked till 5 Days and Nights are expired, and then\r\n  gives a surprising Relation of what he hath seen in the other World.\r\n  Taken from his own mouth in September last; after he had slept 5 days\r\n  in St Bartholomew’s Hospital, the August before. By William Hill, of\r\n  Lincoln’s Inn. The Truth of all which the said Nicholas Hart hath\r\n  attested under his Hand, the 3d Day of August 1711, before several\r\n  credible Witnesses, and declared his Readiness to take oath of the\r\n  same. He began to sleepe as usual the 5th Day of this instant August\r\n  1711 at Mr Dixies at the Cock and Bottle in Little Britain. Entered\r\n  according to Law. Printed for J. Baker, at the Black Boy, in\r\n  Paternoster Row, price 2d.”[295]\r\n\r\nThis same book, under the title of “Life and Visions of William Hart, in\r\nwhich are particularly described the state of the Blessed Spirits in the\r\nHeavenly Canaan, and also a Description of the Condition of the Damned\r\nin a State of Punishment, etc., by Will. Hill, senior of Lincoln’s Inn,\r\nLondon,” is still sold as a chapbook by the “running stationers.” The\r\n_Spectator_ did not believe in Nicholas Hart, and introduced the subject\r\nto the public with his usual humour in No. 191. Hart seems to have\r\ntested the truth of the proverb which says, that fortune comes whilst we\r\nare sleeping, for he certainly made more by sleeping than many others by\r\nwaking. Stow tells a similar story of one William Foxley, potmaker to\r\nthe mint, who slept full fourteen days and fifteen nights, and when he\r\nwoke up “was in all points found as if he had slept but one night.”\r\n\r\nThe COCK AND TRUMPET is a common sign, typifying those ideas about the\r\ncock expressed on p. 205. This simile is constantly used by the poets;\r\nand most beautifully enlarged upon by Shakespeare:--\r\n\r\n  “The _Cock_ that is the _Trumpet_ of the morn,” &c.--_Hamlet_, a. i.\r\n  sc. 1.\r\n\r\n  “And now the _Cock_, the morning’s _trumpeter_,\r\n  Play’d hunt’s up to the day-star to appear.”--_Drayton._\r\n\r\n  “All the night shrill chaunticler,\r\n  Day’s Proclaiming _Trumpeter_,\r\n  Claps his wings and loudly cries,\r\n  Mortals, mortals, wake, arise.”--_Nativity Hymn._[296]\r\n\r\nThe COCK AND BELL, if not a simple combination of two signs, may be\r\nderived from a custom formerly practised in some parts of England, for\r\nboys to have cock-fights on Shrove Tuesday; the party whose cock won the\r\nmost battles, was held victorious in the cock-pit, and gained the\r\nprize--a small silver _bell_ suspended to the button of the victor’s\r\nhat, and worn for three successive Sundays. It is an old sign, and\r\noccurs on a Birchin Lane trades token between 1648 and 1672.\r\n\r\nThe COCK AND BREECHES originated in a favourite form of gilt gingerbread\r\nat Bartholomew Fair, although the very objectionable anecdote of Joe\r\nMiller concerning such a sign is generally believed to have had\r\nsomething to do with its origin.\r\n\r\nThe COCK AND BULL is still frequently seen, but though the meaning of\r\nthe phrase is well understood, neither its origin, nor the meaning of\r\nthe two animals on the signboard, have as yet been properly explained.\r\nAs we have no sound theory to offer, we shall abstain from entering on\r\nthe subject, for fear of giving an illustration of what a cock-and-bull\r\nstory is, rather than clearing up the mystery of the signboard. It\r\noccurs amongst the seventeenth century trades tokens.\r\n\r\nThe COCK AND DOLPHIN was the sign of one of the London carriers’ inns:--\r\n\r\n  “James Nevil’s Coach to Hampstead comes to the Cock and Dolphin in\r\n  Gray’s Inn Lane, in and out every day.”--_De Laune’s Present State of\r\n  London_, 1681.\r\n\r\nHatton, in 1708, placed this inn “on the east side of Gray’s Inn Lane,\r\nnear the middle.” At the present day it is a public-house sign in\r\nKendal, Westmoreland. It is more likely to be a combination of two\r\nsigns, than to refer to the French Cock and the Dolphin in the arms of\r\nthe Dauphin. The same applies to the COCK AND ANCHOR in Gateshead and\r\nDublin; the COCK AND SWAN, and the COCK AND CROWN, both in Wakefield;\r\nand the COCK AND BEAR at Nuneaton; whilst the COCK AND HOUSE in Norwich\r\nmay originally have been the cocking-house of the district,--that is,\r\nthe house where cock-fights were held.\r\n\r\nFully as general as the sign of the Cock is that of the SWAN; the reason\r\nwhy, is perhaps truly, though coarsely, expressed under an old Dutch\r\nsignboard:--\r\n\r\n  “De Swaan voert ieder kroeg, zoowel in dorp als stad,\r\n  Om dat hy altyd graag is met de bek in ’t nat.”[297]\r\n\r\nNot only is there a conformity of æsthetic symbolism in various parts of\r\nEurope, observable in the constant recurrence of the same objects on\r\nsignboards, but even the same jokes are found. Thus the Swan at Bandon,\r\nnear Cork, has the following rhymes, nearly akin to the Dutch epigram\r\nabove, but strongly flavoured with Hibernian wit:--\r\n\r\n  “This is the Swan\r\n  That left her pond,\r\n  To Dip her Bill in porter,\r\n    Why not we,\r\n    As well as she\r\n  Become regular Topers.”\r\n\r\nAnother Milesian at Mallow, also near Cork, has it thus modified:--\r\n\r\n  “This is the Swan that dips her neck in Water,\r\n  Why not we as well as she, drink plenty of Beamish and Crawford’s\r\n  Porter.”\r\n\r\nIn London it was always a favourite sign by the river side:--\r\n\r\n  “‘I find the Swan to be your usual sign by the River,’ said I. ‘Why,\r\n  yes,’ replied George. ‘I don’t know what a Coach or a Waggon and\r\n  Horses or the High-mettled Racer have to do with our _River_.’ ‘Pray,\r\n  now,’ said I to my oracle, ‘do enumerate the signs of the Swan\r\n  remaining [this was in 1829] on the Banks of the River, between London\r\n  and Battersea Bridges.’ ‘Why, let me see, Master, there’s the Old Swan\r\n  at London Bridge, that’s one--there’s the Swan in Arundel Street,\r\n  two,--then ours here, (Hungerford Stairs,) three,--the Swan at\r\n  Lambeth; that’s down though. Well, then the Old Swan at Chelsea, but\r\n  that has long been turned into a Brewhouse, though that was where our\r\n  people [the Watermen] rowed to formerly, as mentioned in Doggett’s\r\n  will; now they row to the sign of the New Swan, beyond the Physick\r\n  Garden; we’ll say that’s four, then there’s the two Swan signs at\r\n  Battersea, six.’”[298]\r\n\r\nThe Swan, by London Bridge, was a very ancient house, and gave a name to\r\nthe Swan stairs. Trades tokens of this house are extant, representing a\r\nSwan walking on Old London Bridge, with the date 1657. This feat was\r\nperformed by the Swan on the token, to intimate that it was the Swan\r\n_above_ the Bridge in contradistinction to another tavern known as the\r\nSwan _below_ the Bridge. Pepys once dined at this house; and though\r\nalways very ready to be pleased, he has not much good to say about it.\r\n“27 June, 1660. Dined with my Lord and all the officers of his regiment,\r\nwho invited my Lord and his friends, as many as he would bring to\r\ndinner, at the Swan at Dowgate, a poor house and ill dressed, but very\r\ngood fish and plenty.” The landlady of this tavern is mentioned in a\r\ncurious manner in a tract printed in 1712, entitled “The Quack\r\nVintners:”--\r\n\r\n  “May the chaste widow prosper at the Swan\r\n  Near London Bridge, where richest wines are drawn,\r\n  And win by her good humour and her trade,\r\n  Some jolly son of Bacchus to her bed.”\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1598 there was a SWAN THEATRE on the Bankside, near the\r\nGlobe; so named from “a house and tenement called the Swan,” mentioned\r\nin a charter of Edward VI., granting the manor of Southwark to the City\r\nof London. It fell into decay in the reign of James I., was closed in\r\n1613, and subsequently only used for gladiatorial exhibitions. Yet, in\r\nits time, it had been well frequented, for a cotemporary author\r\nsays--“it was the Continent of the world, because half the year a world\r\nof beauties and brave spirits resorted to it.” One of the oldest Swan\r\nsigns on record is that of the old printer, Wynkyn de Worde, assistant,\r\nand finally successor to Caxton, who, in the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, issued some works “emprynted at the signe of the Swane in\r\nFletestrete.”\r\n\r\nFrom an anecdote preserved by Aubrey, iii. 415, it appears that Ben\r\nJonson did not always “go to the Devil,” but was also in the habit of\r\nhaving his cup of sack at a Swan tavern near Charing Cross:--\r\n\r\n  “A GRACE BY BEN JONSON EXTEMPORE, BEFORE KING JAMES.\r\n\r\n  “Our king and queen, the Lord God blesse,\r\n  The Palsgrave and the Lady Besse,\r\n  And God blesse every living thing\r\n  That lives and breathes and loves the King.\r\n  God blesse the Councill of Estate,\r\n  And Buckingham the fortunate.\r\n  God blesse them all and keep them safe,\r\n  And God blesse me, and God bless Ralph.\r\n\r\n  “The king was mighty inquisitive to know who this Ralph was. Ben told\r\n  him ’twas the drawer at the Swanne Taverne by Charing-crosse, who drew\r\n  him good canarie. For this drollerie, his Ma^{tie} gave him an hundred\r\n  poundes.”\r\n\r\nTokens of this house of the plague year are extant, representing a Swan\r\nwith a sprig in its mouth, and the inscription, “Marke Rider at the Swan\r\nagainst the Mewes,[299] 1665. His Halfe Penny.”\r\n\r\nThe Swan at Knightsbridge had a reputation which we should call “fast.”\r\nIt was well known to young gallants, and was the terror of all such\r\njealous husbands and fathers as the Sir David Dunce who figures in\r\nOtway’s “Soldier of Fortune,” 1681:--\r\n\r\n  “I have surely lost and never shall find her more. She promised me\r\n  strictly to stay at home till I came back again; for ought I know, she\r\n  may be up three pairs of stairs in the Temple now, or it may be taking\r\n  the air as far as Knightsbridge with some smoothfaced rogue or\r\n  another; ’tis a damned house that Swan; that Swan at Knightsbridge is\r\n  a confounded house!”\r\n\r\nTom Brown also alludes to it; Peter Pindar (Dr Woolcot) commemorates a\r\nvestry dinner there:--\r\n\r\n  “At Knightsbridge at a Tavern called the Swan,\r\n  Churchwardens, Overseers, a jolly clan,\r\n  Order’d a dinner for themselves,\r\n  A very handsome dinner,” &c.\r\n\r\nThe old house was pulled down in 1788, and its name transferred to a\r\npublic-house in Sloane Street, which, with three other houses, occupies\r\nthe site of the old Swan.\r\n\r\nThe Swan tavern in Exchange Alley, Cornhill, was well known among the\r\nmusical world in the last century. In this house, some celebrated\r\nconcerts were given, at a time when there were no proper concert-rooms;\r\nthey commenced in 1728, under the management of one Barton, formerly a\r\ndancing-master, and continued for twelve years, when the place was burnt\r\ndown; at the rebuilding, it was christened the King’s Head.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, the landlord of the Swan tavern at Stratford, near London,\r\nrecommended the charms of his place in the following poetical strain:--\r\n\r\n  “At the Swan Tavern kept by Lound\r\n  The best accommodation’s found,--\r\n  Wine, Spirits, Porter, Bottled Beer,\r\n  You’ll find in high perfection here.\r\n  If in the Garden with your lass\r\n  You feel inclin’d to take a glass,\r\n  There Tea and Coffee of the best,\r\n  Provided is for every guest.\r\n  And females not to drive from hence,\r\n  The charge is only fifteen pence.\r\n  Or if disposed a Pipe to smoke,\r\n  To sing a song or crack a joke,\r\n  You may repair across the Green,\r\n  Where nought is heard, though much is seen.\r\n  There laugh, and drink, and smoke away,\r\n  And but a mod’rate reckoning pay.\r\n  Which is a most important object\r\n  To every loyal British subject.\r\n              In short,\r\n  The best accommodation’s found\r\n  By those who deign to visit Lound.”\r\n\r\nThe BLACK SWAN, though formerly considered a _rara avis in terris_, may\r\nnow be seen in every town and village, swinging at the door of mine\r\nhost, the picture painted just as fancy may have suggested, long before\r\nthe actual bird was brought over from Australia. At the Black Swan\r\ntavern in Tower Street, the Earl Rochester, when banished from the\r\nCourt, took lodgings under the name of Alexander Bendo, his profession\r\nthat of an Italian quack, and there he had those comical adventures with\r\nthe waiting-maids of the Court. Hamilton says in his “Memoires de\r\nGrammont,” that the adventures Rochester had in this disguise are by far\r\nthe most amusing given in his works. Another Black Swan alehouse is\r\nnamed in a broadside of 1704:--\r\n\r\n  “A most strange but true account of a very large sea monster that was\r\n  found last Saturday in a common-shore in New Fleet Street in\r\n  Spittlefields, where at the Black Swan alehouse thousands of people\r\n  resort to see it,” &c.\r\n\r\nThis dreadful monster was simply “a dead Porpoise of a very large size,\r\nit being above Four Foot in length, and Three Foot about,” and the fact\r\nof it “leaving the deep to rove up into Fresh Water Rivers, and more\r\nespecially to crawl up so far a common-shore,” prognosticated, it was\r\nthought, some dire calamities, which are told in not very parliamentary\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThe SWAN WITH TWO NECKS is another _lusus naturæ_ observable on the\r\nsignboard, said to owe its origin to the corruption of the word _nick_\r\ninto _neck_.[300] This explanation, however ingenious, is somewhat\r\n“_sujet à caution_,” for this reason: it is a well-known and established\r\nfact that the London signs of old had no inscriptions under them. Now,\r\nconsidering the small size of the nicks in question, they would scarcely\r\nhave been perceptible at the height on which the sign was generally\r\nsuspended, and even if visible, would never have been sufficiently\r\nnoticed or understood to give a name to the sign. We shall not venture\r\nto propose another solution, as nothing of a sufficiently distinct\r\ncharacter occurs to us: but it is just possible that a sign of two\r\nswans represented swimming side by side may have given rise to the “Swan\r\nwith two necks,” or that the symbol of two birds’ necks encircled by a\r\ncoronet which was used by a foreign publisher--taken, it has been\r\nconjectured, by him from the arms of some trade company--may have been\r\nthe origin.\r\n\r\nMachyn, in his “Diary,” mentions the sign of “the Swane with the ij\r\nnekes at Mylke Street end,” in 1556, when on the 5th of August, a woman\r\nliving next door to that sign drowned herself in Moorfields.\r\n\r\nIn 1636, the TWO NECKED SWAN was already to be seen in Berkshire, at the\r\ntown of Lamburne, where Taylor the water poet names it as the sign of a\r\ntavern. In later years it was a famous carriers’ inn in Lad Lane,\r\nCheapside, whence, for more than a century and a half, passengers and\r\ngoods were despatched to the North. To this inn the following couplet\r\nalludes:--\r\n\r\n  “True sportsmen know nor dread nor fear,\r\n  Each rides, when once the saddle in,\r\n  As if he had a neck to spare,\r\n  Just like the Swan in Ladlane.”\r\n\r\n  _Huddersford Cape Hunt._\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the “double bill” suggested by the two heads, it still\r\ncontinues a favourite inn sign. Four is rather an unusual number on the\r\nsignboard, but we have this quadruple alliance in one solitary instance,\r\nthe FOUR SWANS, Bishopsgate, which is internally one of the best\r\nremaining examples of those famous galleried inns of old London.\r\n\r\nThe SWAN AND BOTTLE, Uxbridge, is a variation of the Cock and Bottle;\r\nthe SWAN AND RUMMER was a coffee-house near the Exchange, during the\r\nSouth Sea bubble--the Rummer, a common addition, being simply joined to\r\nthe Swan, to intimate that wine was sold; the SWAN AND SALMON are\r\ncombined on many signs, doubtless in honour of the two ornaments of our\r\nEnglish rivers. The very name is sufficient to call up a pleasant\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThe SWAN AND HOOP, Moorfields, was the birthplace of Keats the poet. The\r\nSwan on the Hoop, “on the way called old Fysshe Strete,” is mentioned as\r\nearly as 1413.[301] The same combination may still be seen on London\r\nsignboards.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the SWAN AND SUGARLOAF, which occurs amongst the trades\r\ntokens, and is still seen, (as in Fetter Lane, for instance,) the\r\nsugarloaf was at first added by a grocer, whose sign having gained\r\npopularity as a noted landmark, or from other causes, was imitated by\r\nrivals or juniors, particularly on account of its presenting the\r\nfavourite alliteration. Combinations with the sugarloaf are very common,\r\nall arising from its being the grocer’s sign: thus the THREE CROWNS AND\r\nSUGARLOAF, Kidderminster; WHEATSHEAF AND SUGARLOAF, Ratcliff Highway,\r\nseventeenth century, (trades token;) TOBACCO ROLL AND SUGARLOAF, Gray’s\r\nInn Gate, Holborn;[302] the THREE COFFINS AND SUGARLOAF, Fleet Street,\r\n1720.\r\n\r\nIn the sign of the SWAN AND RUSHES, at Leicester, the rushes were merely\r\na pictorial accessory, placed in the background to bring out the white\r\nplumage of the Swan, whilst the SWAN AND HELMET, at Northampton, no\r\ndoubt originated from a helmet with a Swan for crest.\r\n\r\nIn one instance, a DRAKE occurs as a sign, namely, on the token of Will.\r\nJohnson, at “ye Drake in Bell Yard,” near Temple Bar, 1667. The Duck is\r\nonly to be seen in company with the Dog; in one instance it accompanies\r\na Mallard. This last animal was otherwise well known to the Londoners,\r\nsince in 1520, amongst “the articles of good gouernãce of the cite of\r\nLondon,” it was recommended to magistrates--“also ye shall enquyre, yf\r\nony person kepe or norrysh hoggis, oxen, kyen, or _mallardis_ within the\r\nward in noying of ther neyhbours.”[303] The DUCK AND MALLARD was the\r\nsign of a lock (and probably gun-) smith in East Smithfield in\r\n1673.[304]\r\n\r\nThe PIGEON was a tavern at Charing Cross in 1675.[305] The THREE PIGEONS\r\nwere very common; there still exists an inn of this name at Brentford:--\r\n\r\n  “It is a house of interest as being in all likelihood one of the few\r\n  haunts of Shakespeare now remaining; as being indeed the sole\r\n  Elizabethan tavern existing in England, which in the absence of direct\r\n  evidence, may fairly be presumed to have been occasionally visited by\r\n  him.”[306]\r\n\r\nIt was kept at one time by Lowin, one of the original actors in\r\nShakespeare’s plays, and is often named by the old dramatists:\r\n\r\n  “Thou art admirably suited for the _Three Pigeons_ at Brentford. I\r\n  swear I know thee not.”--_The Roaring Girl._\r\n\r\n  “We will turn our courage to Braynford, westward,\r\n  My Bird of the Night--to the Pigeons.”\r\n\r\n  _Ben Jonson’s Alchymist._\r\n\r\nThere, also, George Peel played some of his merry pranks. In the parlour\r\nis an old painting dated 1704, representing a landlord attending to some\r\ncustomers seated at a table in the open air, with these lines:--\r\n\r\n  “Wee are new beginners\r\n  And thrive wee would fain,\r\n  I am honest Ralph of Reading,\r\n  My wife Susana to name.”\r\n\r\nBat Pidgeon, the famous hairdresser, immortalised by the _Spectator_,\r\nlived at the sign of the Three Pigeons, “in the corner house of St\r\nClement’s Churchyard, next to the Strand.” There he remained as late as\r\n1740, when he cut the “boyish locks” of Pennant.\r\n\r\nIn 1663 it was the sign of a bookseller in St Paul’s Churchyard,[307]\r\nand in 1698 of John Newton, also a bookseller over against Inner Temple\r\nGate, Fleet Street.\r\n\r\nThe DOVE was the sign of a coffeehouse on the riverside, between the two\r\nmalls at Fulham. “In a room in this house, Thomson wrote part of his\r\n‘Winter.’ He was in the habit of frequenting the house during the winter\r\nseason, when the Thames was frozen and the surrounding country covered\r\nwith snow. This fact is well authenticated, and many persons visit the\r\nhouse to the present day.”[308] The STOCKDOVE is a sign at Romiley,\r\nStockport; the DOVECOTE is a public-house at Laxton, Carlton-on-Trent,\r\nprobably on account of the _pigeons_ constantly flying out and in; and\r\nthere is a PIGEON BOX at Prior’s Lee, near Shiffnall. The\r\npigeon-shooting matches may have something to do with the selection of\r\nthis sign.\r\n\r\nThe FALCON was another of the devices used by Wynkyn de Worde over his\r\nshop in Fleet Street. Falcon Court, in that locality, perhaps derives\r\nits name from this house. Subsequently, Gordobuc, the earliest English\r\ntragedy, was “imprynted at London, in Flete Strete, at the sign of the\r\nFaucon,” no doubt Wynkyn’s house, by William Griffiths in 1565; and in\r\n1612, Peacham’s “Garden of Heroical Devises” was published by Wa. Dight\r\nat the sign of the Falcon in Shoe Lane. These booksellers, perhaps,\r\nborrowed their device from the stationers’ arms, which are, argent on a\r\nchevron between three bibles, or, a _falcon_ volant between two roses,\r\nthe Holy Ghost in chief; it was also a badge of some of the kings. At\r\nthe Falcon inn, Stratford-on-Avon, there is still a shovelboard on which\r\nWilliam Shakespeare is said often to have played. Another Falcon Tavern\r\nconnected with Shakespeare’s name used to stand on the Bankside, where\r\nhe and his companions occasionally refreshed themselves after the\r\nfatigues of the performances at the Globe. It long continued celebrated\r\nas a coaching inn for all parts of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, till it was\r\ntaken down in 1808. The name is still preserved in the Falcon\r\nGlass-house, which stands opposite its site, and in the Falcon Stairs.\r\nThere was another Falcon Inn in Fleet Street, bequeathed to the company\r\nof cordwainers, by a gentleman named Fisher, under the obligation that\r\nthey were yearly to have a sermon preached in the Church of St Dunstan,\r\nin the West, on the 10th of July. Formerly, on that day, sack and posset\r\nused to be drunk by those concerned, in the vestry of the church, if not\r\nto the health, at least to the “pious memory” of this Fisher; but that\r\ngood custom has long since been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe FALCON ON THE HOOP is named in 1443. “In the xxj yer of Kyng Harry\r\nthe vj^{te},” the brotherhood of the Holy Trinity received “for the rent\r\nof ij yere of Wyllym Wylkyns for the Sarrecyn Head v li. vj s. viij d.,\r\npaynge by the yer liij s. iiij d. and of the _Faucon on the Hope_, for\r\nthe same ij yer vi li., that is to say paynge by the yer iij li.” Rent,\r\nit must be confessed, seems small, and landlords exceedingly\r\naccommodating in those days. Six days before that period, there is an\r\nentry in the church-wardens’ accounts for “kervyng and peinting of the\r\nseigne of the Faucon vj sh.”[309] This mention of the sign clearly shows\r\nthat it was not a picture, but a carved and coloured falcon, suspended\r\nin a hoop, whence the name of the sign.\r\n\r\nThe MAGPIE being a bird of good omen, was, on that account, very often\r\nchosen; with this another reason concurred, namely, the sign of the\r\neatable pie falling into disuse, it was transformed into the Magpie,\r\n(see Cock and Pie;) and this transition was so much the easier as the\r\noriginal name of the magpie was _pie_, (Latin _pica_, French _pie_,) and\r\nonly subsequently for its knowing antics, did it receive the nickname of\r\n_maggoty_[310] pie, which gradually was abbreviated into Magpie. The\r\nfull form of the epithet is preserved in the nursery rhyme:--\r\n\r\n  “Round about, round about,\r\n    _Maggoty Pie_,\r\n  My father loves good ale\r\n    And so do I.”\r\n\r\nThe MAGGOTY PIE was an inn in the Strand during the reign of James I.:\r\nit is alluded to in Shirley’s Comedy of “The Ball,” a. i. sc. 1, where\r\nFreshwater, the Italianised Englishman, says:--\r\n\r\n  “I do ly at the signe of Dona Margaretta de Pia in the Strand.”\r\n\r\nwhich his man Gudgin explains to mean, “the Maggety Pie in the Strand,\r\nsir.”\r\n\r\nAs late as 1654, we find the name “maggoty pie” used in “Mercurius\r\nFumigosus, or the Smoking Nocturnal,” July 26 to August 3, where the\r\nWelshman’s arms are described as a fly, a _maggoty pie_, &c.[311] The\r\nMAGPIE AND STUMP represents the magpie sitting on the stump of a tree;\r\nit was the sign of one of the Whig pothouses in the Old Bailey during\r\nthe riots of 1715. There is still an old house with such a sign in\r\nCheyne Walk, Chelsea. The MAGPIE AND PEWTER PLATTER, in Wood Street,\r\noriginated from a magpie standing by a dish and picking out of it. The\r\nMAGPIE AND CROWN, says the author of “Tavern Anecdotes,” (1825,) is a\r\nridiculous association; but when once joined is not to be separated\r\nwithout injury to the concern, as it happened in the case of a Mr\r\nRenton, who was originally waiter at a house of this name in Aldgate,\r\nfamous for its ale, which was sent out in great quantities. The landlord\r\nbecoming rich, pride followed, and he thought of giving wing to the\r\nMagpie, retaining only the royal attribute of the crown. The ale went\r\nout for a short time, as usual, but it was not from the Magpie and\r\nCrown, and the customers fancied it was not so good as usual;\r\nconsequently the business fell off. The landlord died, and Renton\r\npurchased the concern, caught the Magpie, and restored it to its ancient\r\nsituation; the ale improved in the opinion of the public, and its\r\nconsumption increased so much, that Renton, at his death, left behind\r\nhim property amounting to £600,000, chiefly the profits of the Magpie\r\nand Crown ale. This danger of altering a sign is also illustrated by\r\nanother example. When Joseph II., emperor of Germany, was at Maestricht,\r\nin the Netherlands, he stayed at the GRAY ASS Inn, (_L’Ane Gris_,) in\r\nhonour of which imperial visit the landlord discarded his humble\r\nquadruped sign, and put up the EMPEROR’S HEAD. The customers seeing the\r\nOld Gray Ass gone, thought the business had fallen into other hands, and\r\nso went to various inns in the neighbourhood, and particularly to a NEW\r\nGRAY ASS, which had just then opened in the same street. The landlord\r\nseeing his business falling off, through the change of his sign, yet\r\nunwilling to part with his Emperor’s head, after long thinking and\r\npondering, at last hit upon a clever compromise: he kept up the portrait\r\nof the Emperor, but wrote under it, “At the Original Gray Ass, (_au\r\nveritable Ane Gris_.)”\r\n\r\nThe PARROT, or POPINJAY, is an old sign now almost out of fashion, the\r\nGREEN PARROT, Swinegate, Leeds, being one of the few remaining. Andrew\r\nMaunsell, a bookseller and printer, resided at the Parrot in St Paul’s\r\nChurchyard in 1570, and continued to trade under this sign till 1600.\r\nTaylor, the water poet, mentions the POPINJAY at Ewell, in 1636. It was\r\na very appropriate sign for quacks, and one of these, at all events, had\r\ncandour enough to adopt it. His handbill begins in a grandiloquent\r\nstyle:--\r\n\r\n  “NOBLE or IGNOBLE, you may be foretold anything that may happen to\r\n  your Elementary Life: as at what time you may expect prosperity; or if\r\n  in Adversity the End thereof, or when you may be so happy as to enjoy\r\n  the Thing desired. Also young Men may foresee their Fortunes as in a\r\n  Glass, and pretty Maids their Husbands in this Noble, yea, Heavenlie\r\n  art of Astrologie. At the sign of the Parrot opposite to Ludgate\r\n  Church within Blackfriars’ Gateway.”[312]\r\n\r\nThe PARROT AND CAGE, in St Martin’s Lane, Strand, advertised in 1711 as\r\na “just and substantial office of insurance” on marriages, births, &c.\r\nThis office, apparently, had chambers in some bird-fancier’s house, at\r\nall events to that class of the community the sign belonged more\r\nexclusively. In 1787, there was one near the monument, the sign of a\r\ncagemaker who sold “likewise parrots and other forring birds.”\r\n\r\nThe PEACOCK, in ancient times, was possessed of a mystic character. The\r\nfabled incorruptibility of its flesh led to its typifying the\r\nResurrection; and from this incorruptibility, doubtless, originated the\r\nfirst idea of swearing “by the Peacock,” an oath that was to be\r\ninviolably kept. Its first introduction on the signboard is lost in the\r\nunrecorded wastes of time; but the oath was a common one in early times,\r\nespecially on occasions of military adventures. Near the Angel in\r\nClerkenwell, there is the PEACOCK public-house, which bears the date\r\n1564. This was formerly a great house of call for the mail and other\r\ncoaches travelling on the Great North Road, much the same as the\r\nElephant and Castle was for the southern counties. The PEACOCK AND\r\nFEATHERS was a sign in Cornhill in 1711.\r\n\r\nThe OSTRICH seems more common at present than in ancient times. There is\r\none on a stone-carved sign in Bread Street, probably the sign of a\r\nfeather shop. Generally, the ostrich is represented with a horseshoe in\r\nhis mouth, in allusion to its digestive powers; for this reason Cade\r\nsays to Iden:--\r\n\r\n  “I’ll make thee _eat iron like an ostrich_, and swallow my sword like\r\n  a great pin.”--Henry VI., 2d Part, a. iv. sc. 10.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of an alehouse at Calverley, near Leeds, has put his\r\npremises under the protection of Minerva’s bird, the OWL. At St Helens,\r\nLancashire, there is a still more curious sign, viz., the OWL’S NEST, or\r\nthe Owl in the Ivy Bush. A bush or tod of ivy was formerly supposed to\r\nbe a favourite place for the owl to make its nest in. The old dramatists\r\nabound in allusions to this:\r\n\r\n  “And, like an owle, by night to go abroad,\r\n  Roosted all day within an ivy-tod.”[313]--_Drayton._\r\n\r\n  “Michael von Owle, how dost thou?\r\n  In what dark barn or _tod of aged ivy_\r\n  Hast thou been hid?”--_Beaumont and Fletcher_, a. iv. sc. 3.\r\n\r\nIn a masque of Shirley’s, entitled “The Triumph of Peace,” 1633, one of\r\nthe scenes represented a wild, woody landscape, “a place fit for\r\npurse-taking,” where, “in the furthest part was seene an ivy-bush, out\r\nof which came an owle.” _Opinion_, one of the _dramatis personæ_,\r\ninformed the public, that this scene was intended for “a wood, a\r\nbroad-faced owl, an ivy-bush, and other birds beside her.”[314]\r\n\r\nIn districts where GROUSE and MOORCOCK are found, these birds frequently\r\ncourt the patronage of the thirsty sportsman at the village alehouse\r\ndoor. One publican, at Upper Haslam, Sheffield, invites at once the\r\nfollower of Nimrod and of Walton: his sign is the GROUSE AND TROUT.\r\n\r\nThe last bird-sign which remains to be noticed, is unquestionably the\r\nmost puzzling of all. It occurs on an old trades token of Cornhill, and\r\nis there called “THE LIVE VULTURE.” That the man should have kept a live\r\nvulture at his door seems very improbable. The only explanation which\r\noccurs to us, is the possibility that, at some period or other, a live\r\nvulture had been exhibited at this house, and that from this event its\r\nname was derived.[315]\r\n\r\nA curious instance of a tradesman exhibiting a living bird as an\r\nattraction to his house, is supplied us in a recent letter of a Paris\r\ncorrespondent, which gives at the same time an amusing anecdote of the\r\nwell-known Alexandre Dumas. The writer, speaking of a magnificent new\r\ncafé which had recently been completed, says:--\r\n\r\n  “Writing of this newly started restaurant naturally recals the fact of\r\n  the disappearance of the historic pavilion of Henry IV. at St\r\n  Germain-en-Laye, kept for many years by the Duchess of Berry’s _maître\r\n  d’hôtel_, Collinet. He was the pupil of Carême, and learnt to make\r\n  sauces from Richout, saucemaker to the last of the Condés, and pastry\r\n  from Heliot, “Ecuyer ordinaire de la bouche de Madame la Dauphine,” a\r\n  title I have vainly searched for in the list of the queen’s household.\r\n  The result of this combination of culinary instructions was that his\r\n  “Bifsteaks _à la Bearnaise_,” and his woodcock pies, attracted not\r\n  only all the fashionable world, but a brilliant galaxy of literary\r\n  celebrities to the “Pavilion Henry IV.” Alexandre Dumas’s château of\r\n  Monte Christo was close to St Germain. He sent daily for his cutlets\r\n  to Collinet, who let his bill run on till it amounted to 25,000f.\r\n  (£1000), in payment of which the distinguished _chef_ received an\r\n  autograph letter from the great novelist, accompanied by a _live\r\n  eagle_. Alexandre Dumas expressed his regret at not being able to pay\r\n  the bill, but suggested his _exhibiting the eagle_ and the letter,\r\n  which exhibition would inevitably attract crowds to his hotel, and\r\n  there I myself have seen the eagle and read the letter.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.\r\n\r\nGREEN MAN.\r\n\r\n(Roxburghe Ballads, circa 1650.)\r\n\r\nADAM AND EVE.\r\n\r\n(Newgate Street, 1669.)\r\n\r\nTOBACCONIST SIGN.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1750.)\r\n\r\nDOG’S HEAD IN POT.\r\n\r\n(Roxburghe Ballads, 1665.)\r\n\r\nWHISTLING OYSTER.\r\n\r\n(Drury Lane, 1825.)]\r\n\r\n[280] Coryatt’s Crudities, vol. i. p. 29.\r\n\r\n[281] “Phisiologus tells us that the Pelican is very fond of his young\r\nones, and when they are born and begin to grow, they rebel in their nest\r\nagainst their parent and strike him with their wings, flying about him\r\nand beat him so much till they wound him in his eyes.

Smith, Book for a Rainy Day, p. 280.\r\n\r\n[299] The king’s stables (which stood on the site now occupied by\r\nTrafalgar Square) called the “mews,” because formerly his majesty’s\r\nfalcons were kept there, _mue_ being a French word for a certain kind of\r\nbird-cage or coop: whence the words “mewed up.”\r\n\r\n[300] These nicks were little horizontal, vertical, and diagonal notches\r\ncut in the swan’s bill, in order that each owner might know his own\r\nswans. In the _Archæologia_ for 1812, a roll of 219 swan marks is given,\r\ntogether with the ordinances respecting swans on the river Witham, in\r\nLincoln, belonging to various gentlemen; this paper bears the date of\r\nJune 1570. The nicking was done by swanherds, appointed by the king’s\r\nlicence, who kept a register of all the various marks. None but\r\nfreeholders were to have marks, and these were to be perfectly distinct\r\nfrom those used by other gentlemen. The Corporation of London had the\r\nright of keeping swans on the Thames for fourteen leagues above and\r\nbelow bridge, and their flocks seem to have been very numerous, for\r\nPaulus Jovius describing the approach to London in 1552, says, “This\r\nriver abounds in swans swimming in flocks, the sight of which, and their\r\nnoise, are very agreeable to the fleets that meet them in their course.”\r\nThose of the company of the vintners had two nicks or marks on their\r\nbill, it is said, and hence the popular explanation of the sign. This\r\nnicking of swans on the river was formerly a matter of great state. The\r\nmembers of the Corporation of London used annually to go up the Thames\r\nin the month of August, in gaily decorated barges, and after the swans\r\nwere nicked and counted, to land off Barn Elms, and there partake of a\r\ncollation in the open air, ending which, history informs us, they used\r\nto dance, but it would require very reliable authority to convince us\r\nthat an alderman could find enjoyment on the “light fantastic toe,”\r\nparticularly after a hearty collation.\r\n\r\n[301] For the origin of the sign, see under HOOP.\r\n\r\n[302] _Mercurius Publicus_, Aug. 30-Sept. 16, 1660.\r\n\r\n[303] Arnold’s Customs of London.\r\n\r\n[304] _London Gazette_, October 2-6, 1673.\r\n\r\n[305] _City Mercury_, or Advertisements concerning Trade, Nov. 4, 1675.\r\n\r\n[306] Halliwell’s Local Illustrations to the “Merry Wives of Windsor.”\r\nFolio Shakespeare.\r\n\r\n[307] _Kingdom’s Intelligencer_, March 30 to April 6, 1663.\r\n\r\n[308] Faulkner’s Account of Fulham, 1813, p. 359.\r\n\r\n[309] Hone’s Ancient Mysteries Described, p. 81.\r\n\r\n[310] _Magot_ is in French a quaint, little figure.\r\n\r\n[311] For the benefit of those curious in Cambrian heraldry we will give\r\nthese arms in a note:--“A fly, a maggoty pie, a gammon of bacon and a\r\n----: the fly drinks before his master; a magpie doth prate and chatter,\r\na gammon of bacon is never good till it be hanged, and a ---- when it is\r\nout never returns to its country, no more will a Welshman; otherwise,\r\nhis arms are two trees verdant, a beam tressant, a ladder rampant, and\r\nTaffe pendant.”\r\n\r\n[312] Bagford Bills Harl.

See under RELIGIOUS SIGNS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFISHES AND INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MERMAID, as a sign, must have had great attractions for our\r\nforefathers. Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and other dramatists, notice this\r\ntaste for strange fishes. The ancient chronicles teem with captures of\r\nmermen, mermaids, and similar creatures. Old Hollinshed gives a detailed\r\naccount of a merman caught at Orford, in Suffolk, in the reign of King\r\nJohn. He was kept alive on raw meal and fish for six months, but at last\r\n“fledde secretelye to the sea, and was neuer after seene nor heard off.”\r\nAnother chronicler says, “About this time [1202] fishes of strange\r\nshapes were taken, armed with helmets and shields like armed men, only\r\nthey were much bigger.” And Gervase of Tilbury roundly asserts that\r\nmermen and mermaids live in the British Ocean. Even in more modern\r\ntimes, every now and then a mermaid (the mermen seem to have been more\r\nscarce) made her appearance. In an advertisement at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century, we find:--\r\n\r\n  “IN BELL YARD, on Ludgate Hill, is to be seen, at any hour of the day,\r\n  a living Mermaid, from the waist upwards of a party colour, from\r\n  thence downwards is very strange and wonderful.\r\n\r\n  Mulier formosa superne\r\n  Desinit in piscem.”\r\n\r\nAfter which follows a most promising and tempting little bit of\r\ninformation in French:--“Son corps est de divers couleurs avec beaucoup\r\nd’autres curiosités qu’on ne peut exprimer.” Again, in 1747:--\r\n\r\n  “We hear from the north of Scotland, that some time this month a sea\r\n  creature, known by the name of Mermaid, which has the shape of a human\r\n  body from the trunk upwards, but below is wholly fish, was carried\r\n  some miles up the water of Devron.”[316]\r\n\r\nIn 1824, a mermaid or merman (for the sex was discreetly left _in\r\ndubio_) made its appearance before “an enlightened public,” when, as the\r\npapers inform us, “upwards of 150 distinguished fashionables” went to\r\nsee it. At Bartholomew Fair, in 1830, a stuffed mermaid was exhibited;\r\nbut if once she had been such a “mulier formosa” as captivated the\r\nancient mariners, she was certainly much altered.[317] A very different\r\nspecimen had been exhibited in Fleet Street in 1822; but she disappeared\r\nall at once most mysteriously, not, however, without a rumour of her\r\nbeing under the protection of the Lord Chancellor, which, as she was a\r\ncomely maiden with flaxen hair, “mulier superne _et inferne_,” lies\r\nwithin the range of possibilities. The sea-serpent has now almost done\r\naway with the mermaid; yet, as late as 1857, there appeared an article\r\nin the _Shipping Gazette_, under the intelligence of 4th June, signed by\r\nsome Scotch sailors, and describing an object seen off the North British\r\ncoast, “in the shape of a woman, with full breast, dark complexion,\r\ncomely face,” and the rest.\r\n\r\nAt one time it appears to have been a very common sign, if we may judge\r\nfrom the way in which it is mentioned by Brathwait in his New Cast of\r\nCharacters, (1631):--\r\n\r\n  “If she [the hostess] aspire to the conceit of a sine and device, her\r\n  birch pole pull’d downe, he will supply her with one, which he\r\n  performes so poorely as none that sees it, but would take it for a\r\n  _sign_ he was drunk when he made it. A long consultation is had before\r\n  they can agree what sign must be reared. ‘_A meere-mayde_’ says she,\r\n  ‘for she will sing catches to the youths of the parish.’ ‘A lyon,’\r\n  says he, for that is the onely sign he can make; and this he formes so\r\n  artlessly, as it requires his expression, _this is a lyon_. Which old\r\n  Ellenor Rumming, his tapdame, denies, saying it should have been a\r\n  meere-mayde.”\r\n\r\nAmong the most celebrated of the Mermaid taverns in London, that in\r\nBread Street stands foremost. As early as the fifteenth century, it was\r\none of the haunts of the pleasure-seeking Sir John Howard, whose trusty\r\nsteward records, anno 1464:--“Paid for wyn at the Mermayd in Bred Stret,\r\nfor my mastyr and Syr Nicholas Latimer, x d. ob.” In 1603, Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh established a literary club in this house, doubtless the first\r\nin England. Amongst its members were Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Beaumont\r\nand Fletcher, Selden, Carew, Martin, Donne, Cotton, &c. It is frequently\r\nalluded to by Beaumont and Fletcher in their comedies, but best known is\r\nthat quotation from a letter of Beaumont to Ben Jonson:--\r\n\r\n                  “What things have we seen\r\n  Done at the Mermaid! heard words that have been\r\n  So nimble and so full of subtle flame,\r\n  As if that any one from whence they came\r\n  Had meant to put his whole wit in a jest,\r\n  And had resolved to live a fool the rest\r\n  Of his dull life; then when there hath been thrown\r\n  Wit able enough to justify the town\r\n  For three days past; wit that might warrant be\r\n  For the whole city to talk foolishly,\r\n  Till that were cancell’d; and when that was gone,\r\n  We left an air behind us, which alone\r\n  Was able to make the two next companies\r\n  (Right witty, though but downright fools) more wise.”\r\n\r\nThere was another Mermaid in Cheapside, frequented by Jasper Mayne, and\r\nin the next reign by the poet laureate, John Dryden. Mayne mentions it\r\nin “The City Match,” (1638:)--\r\n\r\n  “I had made an ordinary,\r\n  Perchance at the Mermaid.”\r\n\r\nAt one time the landlord’s name was Dun, which is told us in a somewhat\r\namusing anecdote:--“When Dun, that kept the Meremaid Tavern in Cornhill,\r\nbeing himself in a room with some witty gallants, one of them (which, it\r\nseems, knew his wife) too boldly cryd out in a fantastick humour, ‘I’ll\r\nlay five pound there’s a cuckhold in this company.’ ‘’Tis _Dun_,’ says\r\nanother.”[318] In 1681, there was a Mermaid in Carter Lane, which had a\r\ngreat deal of traffic as a carriers’ inn.[319]\r\n\r\nThe sign was also used by printers. John Rastall, for instance,\r\nbrother-in-law of Sir Thomas More, “emprynted in the Cheapesyde at the\r\nsygne of the Meremayde; next to Poulysgate in 1527;” and in 1576 a\r\ntranslation of the History of Lazarillo de Tormes, dedicated to Sir\r\nThomas Gresham, was printed by Henry Binnemann, the queen’s printer, in\r\nKnight-rider Street, at the sign of the Mermaid. A representation of\r\nthis fabulous creature was generally prefixed to his books.\r\n\r\nThe SEAHORSE may be seen in Birmingham, York, and various other places.\r\nBossewell, in his peculiar mixture of English and Latin, gives a quaint\r\ndescription of this animal:--\r\n\r\n  “This waterhorse of the sea is called an hyppotame, for that he is\r\n  like an horse in back, mayne, and neying: _rostro resupinato a primis\r\n  dentibus: cauda tortuosa, ungulis binis_. He abideth in the waters on\r\n  the day, and eateth corn by night _et hunc Nilus gignit_.”[320]\r\n\r\nThe DOLPHIN is another sign of very old standing. One of the first\r\ninstances of its use was probably the following inn:--\r\n\r\n  “The other side of this High Street, from Bishopsgate and Houndsditch,\r\n  the first building is a large inn for the receipt of travellers, and\r\n  is called the Dolphin, of such a sign. In the year 1513, Margaret\r\n  Ricroft, widow, gave this house, with the gardens and appurtenances,\r\n  unto William Gam, R. Clye, their wives, her daughters, and to their\r\n  heirs, with condition they yearly do give to the warders or govornors\r\n  of the Greyfriars’ Church, within Newgate, 40 shillings, to find a\r\n  student of divinity in the university for ever.”[321]\r\n\r\nMoser, in his “Vestiges Revived,” mentions this same inn as the Dolphin,\r\nor rather, Dauphin Inn; and says that it was adorned with fleur-de-lys,\r\ncognisances, and dolphins; and was reported to have been the residence\r\nof one of the dauphins of France, probably Louis, the son of Philip\r\nAugust, who, in 1216, came to England to contest the sceptre with King\r\nJohn.[322] The house was still in existence at the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, when it was a famous coaching inn. Perhaps it was\r\nto this tavern that Pepys and his company adjourned on 27th March\r\n1661:--\r\n\r\n  “To the Dolphin to a dinner of Mr Harris’s, where Sir William and my\r\n  Lady Batten and her two daughters, and other company, when a great\r\n  deal of mirth, and there staid till 11 o’clock at night, and in our\r\n  mirth I sang and sometimes fiddled, (there being a noise of fiddlers\r\n  there,) and at last we fell to dancing, the first time that ever I did\r\n  in my life, which I did wonder to see myself to do. At last we made\r\n  Mingo, Sir W. Batten’s black, and Jack, Sir W. Penn’s, dance, and it\r\n  was strange how the first did dance with a great deal of skill.”\r\n\r\nPepys might well wonder what a man may come to, he who had been born\r\nwhen “lascivious dancing” was considered a heinous crime. Another\r\nDolphin, well worthy of remembrance, was the sign of Sam. Buckley, a\r\nbookseller in Little Brittain, at whose house Steele and Addison’s\r\n_Spectator_ was published.\r\n\r\nAncient naturalists made a wonderful animal of the dolphin. Bossewell,\r\nfor instance, from whom we have just quoted, tells most extraordinary\r\nstories about him; but they are unfortunately too long to quote.\r\nLondoners formerly might have seen the living fish from the river banks,\r\nfor old chroniclers every now and then have entries to the effect that\r\ndolphins paid London a visit. Thus: “3 Henry V. Seven dolphins came up\r\nthe river Thames, whereof 4 were taken.” “14 Rich. II. On Christmas day\r\na dolphin was taken at London Bridge, being 10 ft. long, and a monstrous\r\ngrown fish.”[323] The DOLPHIN AND ANCHOR is still a common sign; and the\r\nFISH AND ANCHOR, at North Littleton, Warwickshire, evidently implies the\r\nsame emblem. Aldus Manutius, the celebrated Venetian printer, was the\r\nfirst to use the sign, adopting it from a silver medal of the Emperor\r\nTitus, presented to him by Cardinal Bembo, with the motto, σπευδε\r\nβραδεως. Camerarius thus (in our translation) mentions this sign in his\r\nbook on Symbols:--\r\n\r\n  “That the dolphin wound round the anchor was an emblem of the Emperors\r\n  August and Titus, to represent that maturity in business which is the\r\n  medium between too great haste and slowness; and that it was also used\r\n  in the last century by Aldus Manutius, that most famous printer, is\r\n  known to everybody. Erasmus clearly and abundantly explains the import\r\n  of that golden precept.\r\n\r\n  “Our emblem is taken from Alciatus, and has a different meaning. He\r\n  reports, namely, that ‘when violent winds disturb the sea, as\r\n  Lucretius says, and the anchor is cast by seamen, the dolphin winds\r\n  herself round it, out of a particular love for mankind, and directs\r\n  it, as with a human intellect, so that it may more safely take hold of\r\n  the ground; for dolphins have this peculiar property, that they can,\r\n  as it were, foretell storms. The anchor, then, signifies a stay and\r\n  security, whilst the dolphin is a hieroglyphic for philanthropy and\r\n  safety.’”--_Joach. Camerarius_, “_Symbolorum et Emblematum Centuriæ\r\n  Quatuor_.” _Centuria_ iv. p. 19; _Moguntia_, 1697.\r\n\r\nThis sign was afterwards adopted by William Pickering, a worthy\r\n“Discipulus Aldi,” as he styled himself; Sir Egerton Bridges made some\r\nverses upon it, amongst which occur the following:--\r\n\r\n  “Would you still be safely landed,\r\n    On the Aldine _Anchor_ ride;\r\n  Never yet was vessel stranded,\r\n    With the Dolphin by its side.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  “Nor time, nor envy ever shall canker\r\n    The sign that is my lasting pride;\r\n  Joy then to the Aldus Anchor,\r\n    And the Dolphin at its side.\r\n\r\n  “To the Dolphin as we ‘re drinking,\r\n    Life and health and joy we send;\r\n  A poet once he saved from sinking,\r\n    And still he lives--the poet’s friend.”\r\n\r\nThe DOLPHIN AND COMB was the sign of E. Herne, a milliner on London\r\nBridge in 1722. This is an instance of one of the articles sold within\r\nbeing added to the original sign of the house. Milliners in those days\r\nused to have a much more extensive variety of objects for sale than they\r\nhave now, comprehending almost every article required for female\r\napparel,--and including knives, scissors, combs, pattens, patches,\r\npoking sticks, fans, bodkins, &c. Such additions to signs were of\r\nfrequent occurrence, thus the Fox and Topknot, the Lamb and Breeches,\r\nthe Fox and Cap, and the LAMB AND INKBOTTLE, which last figures on the\r\nimprint of Thomas Roch, Newgate Street, a bookseller who made “the best\r\nink for deeds and records,” 1677. Frequently the sign of the Fish is\r\nseen without any further specification; in this case it is probably\r\nmeant for the Dolphin, which is the signboard-fish _par excellence_. The\r\nFish sign is a very common public house decoration at the present day,\r\nprobably for the same reason as the Swan, because he is fond of\r\nliquor,--nay, to such an extent goes his reputation for intemperance,\r\nthat to “drink like a fish” is a quality of no small excellence with\r\npublicans. In Carlisle, however, there are two signs of the FISH AND\r\nDOLPHIN, a rather puzzling combination,--unless it has reference to the\r\ndolphin’s chase after the shoals of small fishes. The FISH AND BELL,\r\nSoho, may either allude to a well-known anecdote of a certain numskull,\r\nwho, when he caught a fish, which he desired to keep for dinner on some\r\nfuture grand occasion, put it back into the river, with a bell round its\r\nneck, so that he should be able to know its whereabouts the moment he\r\nwanted it; or it may be the usual Bell added in honour of the\r\nbell-ringers. A quaint variety of this sign is the BELL AND MACKEREL, in\r\nthe Mile-End Road. The THREE FISHES was a favourite device in the Middle\r\nAges, crossing or interpenetrating each other in such a manner, that the\r\nhead of one fish was at the tail of another. We cannot prove that it had\r\nany emblematic meaning, but it may possibly represent the Trinity, the\r\nfish being a common symbol for Christ, derived from the Greek monogram\r\nor abbreviation, ΙΧΘΥΣ. It occurs as a sign in the following\r\nadvertisement, which minutely describes the livery of a page in the year\r\nof the Restoration:--\r\n\r\n  “On Saturday night last run away from the Lord Rich, Christophilus\r\n  Cornaro, a Turk christened; a French youth of 17 or 18 years of age,\r\n  with flaxen hair, little blew eyes, a mark upon his lip, and another\r\n  under his right eye; of a fair complexion, one of his ears pierced,\r\n  having a pearl-coloured suit, trimmed with scarlet and blue ribbons, a\r\n  coat of the same colour with silver buttons; his name Jacob David.\r\n  Give notice to the Lord, lodging at the Three Fishes in New Street, in\r\n  Covent Garden, a cook-shop, and good satisfaction shall be\r\n  given.”[324]\r\n\r\nTHE THREE HERRINGS, the sign of James Moxton, a bookseller in the\r\nStrand, near Yorkhouse, in 1675, is evidently but another name for the\r\nThree Fishes; at the present day it is the sign of an ale-house in Bell\r\nYard, Temple Bar. Several taverns with this sign are mentioned in the\r\nFrench tales and plays of the 17th century; two of them seem to have\r\nbeen very celebrated, one in the Faubourg St Marceau, the other near the\r\nPalais de Justice; this last one seems to have been particularly\r\nfamous, for it is named as a rival to the celebrated Pomme de Pin. “Si\r\nje vay au Palais, tous ces clercs sont alentour de moy; l’un me mène aux\r\nTrois Poissons, l’autre à la Pomme de Pin.”--Comédie de la Vefve, ac.\r\niii. s. 3.[325] The FISH AND QUART at Leicester must be passed by in\r\nsilence, as the combination cannot immediately be accounted for. Were it\r\nin France a solution would be easier, for in French slang a “poisson,”\r\nor fish, means a small measure of wine. The FISH AND EELS at Roydon, in\r\nEssex; the FISH AND KETTLE, Southampton; and the WHITE BAIT, Bristol,\r\nall tell their own tale, and need no comment. The SALMON is seen\r\noccasionally near places where it is caught. The SALMON AND BALL is the\r\nwell-known Ball of the silkmercers in former times, added to the sign of\r\nthe Salmon; whilst the SALMON AND COMPASSES is the masonic emblem that\r\nis added to the sign. Both these occur in more than one instance in\r\nLondon. The FISHBONE is rarely met with as a public-house sign, though\r\nthere is an example of it at Netherton in Cheshire, and also amongst the\r\nseventeenth century tokens of New Cheapside, Moorfields. But generally\r\nit is the sign of a rag and bone shop, or, in the euphonious language of\r\nthe day, a “miscellaneous repository,” or “bank of commerce.” These\r\nshops, as their title of “marine stores” implies, used to buy all the\r\nodds and ends of rope, sails, seamen’s old clothes, in short all the\r\nrubbish of which a ship is cleared after its return from a long voyage.\r\nBones of large fish would be often amongst the curiosities brought home\r\nby the sailors, these also they bought and hung them up outside their\r\ndoors, and in the end these bones became their distinctive sign. The SUN\r\nAND WHALEBONE at Latton, in Essex, may have originated from a whalebone\r\nhanging outside the house, or that the landlord had laid the foundation\r\nof his fortune as a rag merchant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInsects are of very rare occurrence. The industrious habits of the bees,\r\nhowever, made their habitation a favourite object to imply a similar\r\nindustry in the shopkeepers. Many years ago there used to be at Grantham\r\nin Lincolnshire, a signpost on which was placed a Beehive in full swarm,\r\nwith the following lines under it:--\r\n\r\n  “Two wonders, Grantham, now are thine,\r\n  The highest spire and a living sign.”\r\n\r\nThough the living bees were gone the following season, yet the sign and\r\ninscription remained until very recently. The following is a common\r\ninscription under the sign of the Beehive:--\r\n\r\n  “Within this hive we’re all alive,\r\n    Good liquor makes us funny;\r\n  If you are dry, step in and try\r\n    The flavour of our honey.”\r\n\r\nA tea-dealer at the corner of Oxford Street, Tottenham Court Road, in\r\nthe end of the last century, had for his sign the Walking Leaf, (the\r\n_Phyllium siccifolium_ of the naturalists,) an East Indian insect, of an\r\nanything but agreeable association, when we consider the remarkable\r\nvegetable appearance of this insect, and the possibility that it might\r\nbe dried among the tea-leaves.\r\n\r\nAlthough the frog cannot be considered either an insect or a fish, yet\r\nwe may include it in this chapter. Of frogs there are some instances on\r\nthe signboard; the THREE FROGS, (see under _Heraldic Signs_,) and\r\nFROGHALL, formerly a public-house at the south end of Frog Lane,\r\nIslington. On the front of this house there was exhibited the ludicrous\r\nsign of a plough drawn by frogs. There is at the present day a Froghall\r\nInn at Wolston, near Coventry; and a public-house of that name at\r\nLayerthorpe in the West Riding, but the picture of the sign was\r\ndoubtless unique. The principal inn on the island of Texel is called the\r\nGOLDEN FROG, (_de Goude kikker_.) We may wonder that there are not more\r\nexamples of this sign in Holland, for there are, without doubt, as many\r\nfrogs in that country as there are Dutchmen; and even unto this day it\r\nis a mooted point, which of the two nations has more right to the\r\npossession of the country; both, however, are of a pacific disposition,\r\nso that they live on in a perfect _entente cordiale_.\r\n\r\n[316] _General Magazine_, Jan. 1747.\r\n\r\n[317] It was sketched by George Cruikshank; and a wood-cut of it may be\r\nseen in Morley’s “Memoirs of Bartholomew Fair,” p. 488.\r\n\r\n[318] “Coffeehouse Jests,” 1688, p. 128.\r\n\r\n[319] Delaune’s “Present State of London,” 1681.\r\n\r\n[320] Bossewell’s “Works of Armourie,” 1589, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[321] Stow, p. 62. A striking instance of the depreciation of money\r\nwithin the last three centuries. At the present day, 40s. would scarcely\r\nkeep an Oxford or Cambridge student in cigar-lights.\r\n\r\n[322] Moser makes a slight error. The heir-apparent to the throne of\r\nFrance did not assume the title of Dauphin till 1349, when Humbert II.,\r\nDauphin of Vienne, having no posterity, retired to a monastery, and sold\r\nhis estates to Philip VI., King of France, on behalf of his grandson,\r\nafterwards Charles V.\r\n\r\n[323] Delaune’s “Present State of London.”\r\n\r\n[324] “Mercurius Publicus,” Aug. 30; Sep. 6, 1660.\r\n\r\n[325] “If I go to the Palace of Justice, all those clerks are constantly\r\nafter me; one takes me to the Three Fishes, the other to the Pine\r\nCone.”--_Comedy of the Widow_, a. iii. s. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFLOWERS, TREES, HERBS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn old times, when signboards flourished, there would have been many\r\nreasons for choosing these house-decorations. 1. Their symbolic meaning,\r\nas the olive-tree, the fig-tree, the palm-tree. 2. To intimate what was\r\nsold within, as the vine, the coffee-plant, &c. 3. The use of some\r\nplants as badges. 4. The vicinity of some well-known tree or road-mark,\r\nnear the place where the sign was displayed. 5. The desire of a landlord\r\nto have an unusual sign.\r\n\r\nThe oldest sign borrowed from the vegetable kingdom is the Bush; it was\r\na bush or bunch of ivy, box or evergreen, tied to the end of a pole,\r\nsuch as is represented in many of the suttler’s tents in the pictures of\r\nWouverman. The custom came evidently from the Romans, and with it the\r\noft-repeated proverb, “Good wine needs no Bush.” (_Vinum vendibile\r\nhedera non est opus_; in Italian, _Al buon vino non bisogna frasca_; in\r\nFrench, _à bon vin point d’enseigne_.) Ivy was the plant commonly used:\r\n“The Tavern Ivy clings about my money and kills it,” says the sottish\r\nslave in Massinger’s “Virgin Martyr,” (a. iii. s. 3.) It may have been\r\nadopted as the plant sacred to Bacchus and the Bacchantes, or perhaps\r\nsimply because it is a hardy plant, and long continues green. As late as\r\nthe reign of King James I. many inns used it as their only sign. Taylor,\r\nthe water poet, in his perambulation of ten shires around London, notes\r\nvarious places where there is “a taverne with a bush only;” in other\r\nparts he mentions “the signe of the Bush.” Even at the present day “the\r\nBush” is a very general sign for inn and public-house, whilst sometimes\r\nit assumes the name of the IVY BUSH, or the IVY GREEN, (two in\r\nBirmingham.) In Gloucester, Warwick, and other counties, where at\r\ncertain fairs the ordinary booth people and tradesmen enjoy the\r\nprivilege of selling liquors without a licence, they hang out bunches of\r\nivy, flowers, or boughs of trees, to indicate this sale. As far away as\r\nthe western States of North America, at the building of a new village,\r\nor station, it is no uncommon thing to see a bunch of hay, or a green\r\nbough, hung from above the “grocery,” or bar-room door, until such time\r\nas a superior decoration can be provided. The bunch being fixed to a\r\nlong staff was also called the Alepole; thus among the processions of\r\nodd characters that came to purchase ale at the Tunnyng of Elinour\r\nRummyng:--\r\n\r\n  “Another brought her bedes\r\n  Of jet or of coale,\r\n  To offer to the _Alepole_.”\r\n\r\nHow these Alepoles, from the very earliest times, continued to enlarge\r\nand encroach upon the public way, has been shown in our Introduction,\r\npp. 16, 17. The Bunch gradually became a garland of flowers of\r\nconsiderable proportions, whence Chaucer, describing the Sompnour,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  “A garlond hadde he sette upon his hede\r\n  As gret as it were for an alestake.”\r\n\r\nAfterwards it became a still more elegant object, as exemplified by the\r\nNagshead in Cheapside, in the print of the entry of Marie de Medici;\r\nfinally it appeared as a crown of green leaves, with a little Bacchus,\r\nbestriding a tun dangling from it. Thus the sign was used simultaneously\r\nwith the bush.\r\n\r\n  “If these houses [ale-houses] have a boxe-bush, or an old post, it is\r\n  enough to show their profession. But if they be graced with a signe\r\n  compleat, it’s a signe of a good custome.”[326]\r\n\r\nIn a mask of 1633, the constituents of a tavern are thus described:--“A\r\nflaminge red lattice, seueral drinking roomes, and a backe doore, but\r\n_especially a conceited signe and an eminent bush_.” “Tavernes are\r\nquickly set up, it is but hanging out a bush at a nobleman’s or an\r\nalderman’s gate, and ’tis made instantly.”--_Shirley’s Masque of the\r\nTriumph of Peace._ In a woodcut from the “Cent Nouvelle Nouvelles,”\r\nintroduced in Wright’s “Domestic Manners,” the Bush is suspended from a\r\nsquare board, on which the sign was painted; for in France as well as in\r\nEngland, signboard and bush went together:--\r\n\r\n  “La taverne levée\r\n  _L’enseigne et le bouchon_,\r\n  La dame bien peignée\r\n  Les cheveux en bouchon.”[327]\r\n\r\n  --_Chanson nouvelle des Tavernes et Tavernières, Fleur des Chansons\r\n  Nouvelles, Lyon_, 1586.\r\n\r\nWhilst an English host in “Good News and Bad News,” says:--“I rather\r\nwill take down my bush and sign than live by means of riotous expense.”\r\nGradually, as signs became more costly, the bunch was entirely neglected\r\nand the sign alone remained.\r\n\r\nThe HAND AND FLOWER is a sign very frequently adopted by alehouses in\r\nthe vicinity of nursery grounds:--thus, there is one in the High Street,\r\nKensington, and one in the King’s Road, a little past Cremorne, though\r\nthere the nursery ground has very recently been built over.\r\n\r\nThe ROSE, besides being the queen of flowers, and the national emblem,\r\nhad yet another prestige which alone would have been sufficient to make\r\nit a favourite sign in the middle ages; this was its religious import.\r\nOn the monumental brass of Abbot Kirton, formerly in Westminster Abbey,\r\nthere was a crowned rose with I.H.C. in its heart, and round it the\r\nwords\r\n\r\n  SIS, ROSA, FLOS FLORUM, MORBIS MEDECINA MEORUM.[328]\r\n\r\nAnd in Caxton’s Psalter, above a woodcut representing an angel holding a\r\nshield with a rose on it, occur the words:--\r\n\r\n  “Per te rosa toluntur vitia,\r\n  Per te datur mestis leticia.”[329]\r\n\r\nIt was evidently an emblem of the Virgin, and may contain some allusion\r\nto the Rose of Jericho, or to the Christmas rose.\r\n\r\nThree centuries ago roses were still very scarce, as we learn from an\r\noriginal MS. of the time of Henry VIII., and signed by him, preserved at\r\nthe Remembrance Office, in which it says that a red rose cost two\r\nshillings; hence, roses were often amongst the terms of a tenure. Sir\r\nChristopher Hatton, the handsome Lord Chancellor, with the “bushy beard\r\nand shoe strings green,” who danced himself into Queen Elizabeth’s\r\nfavour, paid the Bishop of Ely for the rent of Ely House for a term of\r\ntwenty-one years in 1576, a _red rose_, ten loads of hay, and £10\r\na-year; but that roses then were plentiful, in that garden at all\r\nevents, is also evident, for the Bishop and his successors had a right\r\nto gather yearly twenty bushels of roses out of it. Sir John Poulteney,\r\n21 Edward III., gave and confirmed by charter to Humphrey de Bohun, Earl\r\nof Hereford and Essex, his tenement of Cold Harborough, and\r\nappurtenances, for one rose at Midsummer; a still more whimsical tenure\r\nwas that of a farm at Brookhouse, Penistone, York, for which yearly a\r\npayment was to be made of a red rose at Christmas, and a snow ball at\r\nMidsummer.[330] Unless the flower of the Viburnum or Gueldres Rose,\r\nsometimes called a Snowball, was meant, the payment will have been\r\nalmost impossible in those days when ice-cellars were unknown.\r\n\r\nAt the present day some publicans take liberties with the old sign of\r\nthe Rose; in Macclesfield, and at Preston, for instance, there is the\r\nMOSS ROSE; on Silkstone Common, in Yorkshire, the BUNCH OF ROSES; on the\r\nLondon Road, Preston, the ROSEBUD, &c. The THREE ROSES was formerly a\r\ncommon sign; from the way they are represented, they appear to have been\r\nheraldic roses, (see our _illustration_ of the ancient Lattice.) It was\r\nthe sign of Jonathan Edwin, bookseller in Ludgate Street in 1673. At the\r\nROSE GARLAND, Robert Coplande, the bookseller and printer, published in\r\n1534 Dame Juliana Berner’s “Boke of Hawkyng, Huntyng, and Fyshyng.” This\r\nshop was in “the Flete Strete.” Rose garlands or chaplets were not only\r\nworn in the middle ages as head-dresses, but also awarded as archery\r\nprizes.\r\n\r\n  “On euery syde a Rose garlonde\r\n  They shott under the lyne,\r\n  Whoso faileth of the Rose garlonde, sayth Robyn,\r\n  His tackyll he shall tyne.”\r\n\r\n  _Merry Gestes of Robin Hoode._\r\n\r\nCopland’s Rose garland, doubtless, suggested the sign of another\r\nbookseller, John Wayland, who also lived in Fleet Street about the year\r\n1540; his sign was the BLUE GARLAND.\r\n\r\nThe colloquial phrase, UNDER THE ROSE, is sometimes used as a sign, or\r\nwritten under the pictorial representation of the rose; it occurs on a\r\ntrade’s token of Cambridge,[331] and may be seen on various\r\npublic-houses of the present day. Numerous suppositions have been made\r\nconcerning its origin, some holding that it arose from this flower being\r\nthe emblem of Harpocrates; others from a rose painted on the ceiling,\r\nany conversations held under which were not to be divulged; whilst\r\nGregory Nazianzen seems to imply that the rose, from its close bud, had\r\nbeen made the emblem of silence.\r\n\r\n  “Utque latet rosa verna suo putamine clausa,\r\n  Sic os vincla ferat, validis arcietur habenis,\r\n  Indicatque suis prolixa silentia labris.”[332]\r\n\r\nAt Lullingstone Castle, in Kent, the residence of Sir Percival Dyke,\r\nBart., there is, says a correspondent of Notes and Queries, a\r\nrepresentation of a rose nearly two feet in diameter, surrounded with\r\nthe following inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Kentish true blue\r\n    Take this as a token,\r\n  That what is said here\r\n    Under the Rose is spoken.”\r\n\r\nThe Dutch have a similar phrase. In an old Book of Inscriptions of the\r\nseventeenth century is a device written round a rose painted on the\r\nceiling:--\r\n\r\n  “Al wat hier onder de Roos geschied,\r\n  Laat dat aldaar en meld het niet.”[333]\r\n\r\nThere is one sign of the Rose, the origin of which it is difficult to\r\nascertain, this is the ROSE OF NORMANDY, a public-house in the High\r\nStreet, Marylebone. It was built in the seventeenth century, and is the\r\noldest house in that parish. In 1659 it is described as having\r\n\r\n  “Outside a square brick wall set with fruit trees, gravel walks 204\r\n  paces long, 7 broad; the circular wall 485 paces long, 6 broad; the\r\n  centre square, a bowling-green, 112 paces one way, 88 another--all,\r\n  except the first, double set with quickset hedges, full grown, and\r\n  kept in excellent order, and indented like town walls.”[334]\r\n\r\nThe street having been raised, the entrance to the house is at present\r\nsome steps beneath the roadway. The original form of the exterior has\r\nbeen preserved, and the staircases and balusters are coeval with the\r\nbuilding; but the garden and large bowling-green have dwindled into a\r\nmiserable skittle-ground.\r\n\r\nAs a sign the MARYGOLD, it is said, arose from a popular reading of the\r\nsign of the SUN; a very natural and plausible origin. At the same time,\r\nit is just worth mentioning, that this flower (originally called _the\r\nGold_) seems to have been considered as an emblem of Queen Mary; so, at\r\nleast, it would appear from a lengthy ballad of “the Marygolde,”\r\ncomposed by her chaplain, William Forrest, in which, amongst many other\r\nsimilar allusions, the following words are found:--\r\n\r\n  “She [the Queen] may be called Marygolde well,\r\n    Of _Marie_ (chiefe) Christes mother deere,\r\n  That as in heaven she doth excell,\r\n    And _golde_ on earth to have no peere,\r\n  So certainly she shineth cleere,\r\n    In grace and honour double fold,\r\n  The like was never erst seen heere,\r\n    Such as this flower the Marygolde.”\r\n\r\nThe flower was a favourite one in the middle ages, deriving the first\r\npart of its name from the Virgin Mary. No mention of the actual use of\r\nthe sign, however, has been met with previous to 1638, when it appears\r\non the title-pages of Francis Eglisfield, a bookseller in St Paul’s\r\nChurchyard. His name still occurs at the same house in 1673,[335] when\r\nit was also the sign of “Mr Cox, milliner, over against St Clement’s\r\nChurch in the Strand.”[336] This must have been the same house in which\r\nRichard Blanchard and Francis Child, the goldsmiths, kept their “running\r\ncashes.”[337] It is the oldest banking firm in London. Francis Child,\r\nthe founder, was, in the reign of Charles I., apprenticed to a\r\ngoldsmith, William Wheeler, whose shop stood on the same spot now\r\noccupied by the bank. He married his master’s daughter, and thus laid\r\nthe foundation of his immense fortune. Many bills and other papers\r\nrelating to Nell Gwynn are still preserved by this firm, as well as\r\nvarious documents concerning the sale of Dunkerque. Alderman Blackwell,\r\nwho was ruined by the shutting up of the Exchequer in the reign of\r\nCharles II., was at one time a partner in this house. It was here that\r\nDryden deposited the £50 offered for the discovery of the bullies of the\r\n“Rose-alley cudgel ambuscade.”[338] The old sign of the house is still\r\npreserved by their successors, together with various relics of the Devil\r\nTavern, on the site of which it was built.\r\n\r\nOnly a few other flowers occur, mostly modern introductions. The DAISEY,\r\nBramley, Leeds; the TULIP, Springfield, Chelmsford; the LILIES OF THE\r\nVALLEY, Ible, near Wirksworth; the SNOWDROP, near Lewes; WOODBINE\r\nTavern, South Shields; and the FOREST BLUE BELL, Mansfield. The Blue\r\nBell is very common, but, _inter doctores lis est_, whether it signifies\r\nthe little blue flower, or a bell painted blue.\r\n\r\nAs a sequel to the flowers, we may name the MYRTLE tree, of which there\r\nare two in Bristol, and the ROSEMARY BRANCH, in Camberwell, and in many\r\nother places. Rosemary was formerly an emblem of Remembrance, in the\r\nsame way as the Forget-me-not is now; “There’s Rosemary, that’s for\r\n_remembrance_,” says Ophelia, (Hamlet, ac. iv., s. 5,) and in Winter’s\r\nTale, Perdita says:--\r\n\r\n  “For you, there’s Rosemary and Rue, these keep\r\n  Seeming and savour all the winter long,\r\n  Grace and _remembrance_ be to you both.”\r\n\r\n  _Winter’s Tale_, ac. iv., s. 4.\r\n\r\nHence Rosemary and gloves were of old presented to those who followed\r\nthe funeral of a friend.\r\n\r\nFruit trees are much more common, particularly the APPLE-TREE and the\r\nPEAR-TREE, which (owing to the favourite drinks of cider and perry) are\r\nnext to the Rose; and the Oak, the most frequent among vegetable signs.\r\nThe APPLE-TREE, near Coldbath Fields prison, was one of the numerous\r\npublic-houses which Topham the strong man kept in 1745. At the\r\nApple-tree Tavern, in Charles Street, Covent Garden, four of the leading\r\nLondon Free Masons’ lodges, considering themselves neglected by Sir\r\nChristopher Wren in 1716, met and chose a grandmaster, _pro tem._, until\r\nthey should be able to place a noble brother at the head, which they did\r\nthe year following, electing the Duke of Montague. Sir Christopher had\r\nbeen chosen in 1698. The three lodges that joined with the Apple-tree\r\nLodge used to meet respectively at the GOOSE AND GRIDIRON, St Paul’s\r\nChurchyard; THE CROWN, Parker’s Lane; and at the RUMMER AND GRAPES\r\nTavern, Westminster. The HAND AND APPLE was the sign, in 1782, of a shop\r\nin Thames Street, where “syder, Barcelona, cherry brandy, tobacco,” &c.,\r\nwere sold. It represented a hand holding an apple, and was chosen on\r\naccount of the cider.[339] To this beverage other signs owe their\r\norigin: for instance, the RED-STREAK TREE, from the apple of which the\r\nbest cider is made. Tickets used formerly to be in the windows of houses\r\nwhere cider was sold, with the words, “Bright Red-streak Cyder sold\r\nhere,” illustrated with three merry companions in cocked hats, sitting\r\nunder an apple-tree drinking cider, on the other side a pile of barrels,\r\nfrom which the landlord is drawing the liquor. In Maylordsham, Hereford,\r\nthis sign is rendered as the “Red-streaked Tree;” there was a\r\nRed-streaked Tree Inn in that same town in 1775.[340] The APPLE-TREE AND\r\nMITRE is an old painted sign, a great deal the worse for London smoke,\r\nin Cursitor Street. It represents an apple-tree abundantly loaded with\r\nfruit, standing in a landscape, with some figures; above it a gilt\r\nmitre. It is evidently a combination of two signs.\r\n\r\nThe PEAR-TREE is as common as the Apple-tree. The IRON PEAR-TREE at\r\nAppleshaw, Andover, Hants, and at Redenham in the same county, _may_\r\nhave been derived from some noted pear-tree in that neighbourhood, whose\r\nhollow and broken stem was secured with plates or bands of iron. Very\r\ngeneral, also, is the CHERRY-TREE. It was the sign of a once famous\r\nresort in Bowling-green Lane, Clerkenwell, and was adopted on account of\r\nthe quantities of cherry-trees which grew upon its grounds, even as late\r\nas thirty or forty years ago. In our younger days, this house was the\r\nresort of the fast men of Clerkenwell; its bowling-green gave the name\r\nto the alley in which the house stood. Down the river, at Rotherhithe,\r\nwas the CHERRY-GARDEN, a famous place of entertainment in the reign of\r\nthe Merry Monarch. Pepys went to it on June 15, 1664, and, with his\r\nusual pleasant flow of animal spirits, “came home by water, singing\r\nmerrily.”\r\n\r\n  “Over against the parish church, [St Olave’s, Southwark,] on the south\r\n  side of the street, was some time one great house, builded of stone,\r\n  with arched gates, which pertained to the Prior of Lewis, in Sussex,\r\n  and was his lodging when he came to London; it is now a common\r\n  hostelry for travellers, and hath to sign the WALNUT-TREE.”[341]\r\n\r\nThe WALNUT-TREE was also the sign of a tavern at the south side of St\r\nPaul’s Churchyard, over against the New Vault, in which place a concert\r\nis advertised in July 1718, which, from the high price of the admission\r\ntickets--5s. each--must have been something out of the common.[342] The\r\nWalnut-tree was frequently adopted by cabinetmakers, and is at the\r\npresent day a not uncommon alehouse sign.\r\n\r\nThe MULBERRY-TREE was introduced at an early period, but does not seem\r\nto have been used as a sign until modern times. James I., in 1609,\r\ncaused several shiploads of mulberry trees to be imported from abroad to\r\nencourage the home manufacture of silk: these were planted in a part of\r\nSt James’s Park; but the climate being too cold for the silk worms, it\r\nwas changed into a pleasure garden, where even the serious Evelyn would\r\noccasionally relax. 10th May 1654:--\r\n\r\n  “My Lady Gerard treated us at the Mulberry Gardens, now y^{e} only\r\n  place of refreshment about y^{e} towne for persons of y^{e} best\r\n  quality to be exceedingly cheated at; Cromwell and his partizans\r\n  having shut up and seized on Spring Gardens, which till now had been\r\n  y^{e} usual rendezvous for y^{e} ladys and gallants at this season.”\r\n\r\nHere Dryden went to eat mulberry tarts, and here Pepys occasionally\r\ndined, as 5th April 1669, when he indulged in what he calls an “olio,”\r\nevidently an _olla podrida_, since it was prepared by a Spanish cook;\r\nand the dish was so “noble,” and such a success, that he and his friends\r\nleft the rest of their dinners untouched; and after a ride in a coach\r\nand a walk for digestion, they took supper “upon what was left at noon,\r\nand very good.”\r\n\r\nOrange trees were one of the ornaments of St James’ Park in the reign of\r\nCharles II.; and at that period and long after, were mostly used as\r\nsignboards of the seed-shops, and by Italian merchants. The ORANGE-TREE\r\nAND TWO JARS was the sign of a shop of the latter description in the\r\nHaymarket in 1753.[343] No doubt, the orange tree must have obtained\r\nsome popularity in the reign of William III., as it is the emblem of the\r\nOrange family. The orange tree is said to be originally a Chinese plant,\r\n(whence they were formerly called China oranges.) They were unknown to\r\nthe ancients, and introduced by the Moors into Sicily in the twelfth\r\ncentury. France possessed them in the fourteenth century; and probably\r\nmuch about the same period they were brought to England, for we find\r\n“pome d’orring” mentioned as one of the items at the coronation dinner\r\nof Henry IV. in 1399, where they occur in the third course, along with\r\n_quincys en comfyte doucettys_, and other items of a modern\r\ndessert.[344] But a still earlier instance is mentioned in the “Book of\r\nDays,” (vol. ii. p. 694,) viz., in 1290, when a large ship from Spain\r\narrived at Portsmouth laden with spices. On this occasion, Queen Eleanor\r\nof Castile, anxious to taste again the luscious fruit that reminded her\r\nof her home in sunny Spain and the days of her girlhood, bought out of\r\nthe cargo “a frail of figs, of raisins, and of grapes, a bale of dates,\r\n230 pomegranates, 15 citrons, and 7 oranges.” This probably is the\r\noldest mention of the orange being brought to England. The tree is said\r\nto have been introduced into this country by a member of the Carew\r\nfamily. Oranges are named amongst the articles of diet consumed by the\r\nLords of the Star Chamber in 1509, when their price is quoted one day at\r\niijd., and another at ijd., whilst the charge for strawberries was\r\nvijd., and on another day iiijd.[345] Perhaps, however, they were only\r\nused as _hors d’œuvres_, for Randle Holme, in his instructions how to\r\narrange a dinner, (in that _omnium gatherum_, “Academy of Armory,”)\r\nmentions oranges and lemons as the first item of the second course. At\r\nall events, they were abundant enough in 1559, for on May day of that\r\nyear the revellers “at the queen’s plasse at Westmynster shott and threw\r\neges and _orengs_ on a-gaynst a-nodur.”[346] In an “Account of several\r\nGardens near London,” in 1691,[347] Beddington Gardens are\r\nmentioned--then in the hands of the Duke of Norfolk, but belonging to\r\nthe Carew family--as having in it the best oranges in England. The\r\norange and lemon trees grew in the ground, “and had done so near one\r\nhundred years, the house in which they were being above 200 feet long.\r\nEach of the trees was about 13 feet high, and generally full of fruit,\r\nproducing above 10,000 oranges a year.” Sir William Temple’s oranges at\r\nSheen are also praised. It is, indeed, a pity that this plant has so\r\nmuch gone out of fashion; for, besides being always green, it bears\r\nfruit and flowers all the year round, both appearing at the same time.\r\nThe flowers have a delicious smell; the candied petals impart a very\r\nfine flavour to tea, if a few of them are infused with it; whilst the\r\nfruit may be preserved in exactly the same manner as other fruit. The\r\nsign of the orange-tree still occurs at Highgate, Birmingham; the LEMON\r\nTREE at Beacon Street, Lichfield.\r\n\r\nThe OLIVE TREE was a common Italian warehouse sign, but was occasionally\r\nused by other shops. Amongst the tokens in the Beaufoy Collection, there\r\nis the “Olfa Tree, Singon Strete,” an example of the liberties taken\r\nwith our language on the old tokens, as this stands for the Olive Tree\r\nin St John’s Street. The usefulness of the olive tree made it in very\r\nearly times a symbol of peace. In 1503 it was the sign of Henry\r\nEstienne, a bookseller and printer at the end of the Rue de St Jean\r\nBeauvais, otherwise Clos Bruneau, in Paris. This firm, for several\r\ngenerations, continued the leading publishers and printers in Paris.\r\nSauval, who wrote in 1650, says that in his time the olive tree, carved\r\nin stone, was still to be seen in the front of the house. Here Francis\r\nI., in 1539, visited Robert Estienne, grandson of the founder of the\r\nfirm, in his workshops; and to give him a proof of his favour, conferred\r\nupon him the title of Printer to the King for Latin and Hebrew; and\r\npresented him with those beautiful letters which Estienne proudly\r\nmentions on his title-pages: “Ex officina Roberti Stephani, typographi\r\nregii, _typis regiis_.”\r\n\r\nThe VINE, or the BUNCH OF GRAPES, is a very natural sign at a place\r\nwhere wine is sold. The last particularly was almost inseparable from\r\nevery tavern, and was often combined with other objects--\r\n\r\n  “Without there hangs a noble sign,\r\n  Where golden grapes in image shine;\r\n  To crown the bush, a little Punch-\r\n  Gut Bacchus dangling of a bunch,\r\n  Sits loftily enthron’d upon\r\n  What’s called (in miniature) a Tun.”\r\n\r\n  _Compleat Vintner_: London, 1720, p. 86.\r\n\r\nThe BUNCH OF CARROTS, at Hampton Bishop, Hereford, is probably meant as\r\na joke upon the Bunch of Grapes. Bagford, in a letter to his brother\r\nantiquary, Leland,[348] says:--\r\n\r\n  “I have often thought, and am now fully perswaded, that the planting\r\n  of vines in the adjacent parts about this city, was first of all begun\r\n  by the Romans, an industrious people, and famous for their skill in\r\n  agriculture and gardening, as may appear from their _rei agrariæ\r\n  scriptores_, as well as from Pliny and other authors. We had a\r\n  vineyard in East Smithfield, another in Hatton Garden, (which\r\n  at this time is called Vine Street,) and a third in St\r\n  Giles-in-the-Fields.[349] Many places in the country bear the name of\r\n  the Vineyard to this day, especially in the ancient monasteries, as\r\n  Canterbury, Ely, Abingdon, &c., which were left as such by the\r\n  Romans.”\r\n\r\nIn Bede’s time vineyards were abundant; and still later, tithes on wine\r\nwere common in Gloucester, Kent, Surrey, and the adjacent counties.\r\nWinchester was famous for its vineyards in olden times, for Robert of\r\nGloucester, in summing up the various commodities of the English\r\ncounties, says:--\r\n\r\n  “And London ships most, and _wine_ at Winchester.”\r\n\r\nThe Isle of Ely was called Isle des Vignes, and the tithe on the vines\r\nyielded as much as three or four tuns of wine to the bishop. Even in\r\nRichard II.’s time, the Little Park at Windsor was used as a vineyard\r\nfor the home consumption; and the vale of Gloucester, according to\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury, produced, in the twelfth century, as good a wine\r\nas many of the provinces of France; this county, in fact, produced the\r\nbest wine:--\r\n\r\n  “There is no province in England hath so many or such good vineyards\r\n  as this county, [Gloucester,] either for fertility or sweetness of the\r\n  grape; the wine whereof carrieth no unpleasant tartness, being not\r\n  much inferior to French in sweetness.”[350]\r\n\r\nFrom the household expenses of Richard de Swinfield, Bishop of Hereford,\r\n(1289-1290,) it appears that the white wine was at that period chiefly\r\nhome-grown, whilst the greater proportion of red wine was imported from\r\nabroad. Even as late as the last century wine was made in England:\r\nFaulkner[351] quotes the following memorandum from the MS. notes of\r\nPeter Collinson:--\r\n\r\n  “October 18, 1765.--I went to see Mr Roger’s vineyards at Parson’s\r\n  Green [at Fulham] all of Burgundy grapes, and seemingly all perfectly\r\n  ripe; I did not see a green, half-ripe grape in all this quantity. He\r\n  does not expect to make less than fourteen hogsheads of wine. The\r\n  branches and fruit are remarkably large, and the wine very strong.”\r\n\r\nGrosley[352] mentions a vineyard at Cobham, belonging to a Mr Hamilton,\r\nof about half an acre, planted with Burgundian vines; but the wine it\r\nproduced will cause nobody to regret that the culture has been\r\nabandoned, for “it was a liquor of a darkish gray color; to the palate\r\nit was like verjuice and vinegar blended together by a bad taste of the\r\nsoil.” This description, enough to set the teeth on edge, is most likely\r\ntrue, and gives us the reason why English wine came to be abandoned.\r\n\r\nAs the vine was set up as a sign in honour of wine, so the HOP-POLE, or\r\nthe HOP AND BARLEYCORN, the BARLEY MOW, the BARLEY STACK, the MALT AND\r\nHOPS, and the HOPBINE, are very general tributes of honour rendered to\r\nbeer. In many ale-houses a bunch of hops may be seen suspended in some\r\nconspicuous place.\r\n\r\nThe PINE-APPLE, in the end of the last and the beginning of this\r\ncentury, was generally the emblem adopted by confectioners, though not\r\nexclusively, for it was the sign of an eating-house in New Street,\r\nStrand, at which Dr Johnson, on his first coming to town, used to dine.\r\n\r\n  “I dined very well for eightpence, with very good company, at the\r\n  Pine-apple in New Street, just by.[353] Several of them had travelled;\r\n  they expected to meet every day, but did not know one another’s\r\n  names. It used to cost the rest a shilling, for they drank wine; but I\r\n  had a cut of meat for sixpence, and bread for a penny, and gave the\r\n  waiter a penny; so that I was quite well served, nay, better than the\r\n  rest, for they gave the waiter nothing.”\r\n\r\nThe pine-apple was first known at the discovery of America, and was\r\npreserved in sugar as early as 1556. The first pine-apple was brought\r\nfrom Santa Cruz to the West Indies, thence to the East Indies and China.\r\nLady Mary Wortley Montagu, writing in October 1716, informs her sister\r\nthat she had been at a supper of the King of Hanover, “where there\r\nwere,” says she, “what I thought worth all the rest, two ripe ananas,\r\nwhich, to my taste, are a fruit perfectly delicious. You know they are\r\nnaturally the growth of Brazil, and I could not imagine how they came\r\nthere, but by enchantment.” Upon inquiry she learned that they had been\r\nforced in stoves or hot-houses, and is “surprised we do not practise in\r\nEngland so useful an invention.” It was not till the end of the last\r\ncentury that they were introduced into English gardens, having been\r\nbrought over from hot-houses in Holland; and from that time seems to\r\ndate their introduction on the signboard. It is still in general use\r\nwith public-houses.\r\n\r\nOf the FIG TREE there are several examples among the London trades\r\ntokens, some of them, no doubt, grocers’ signs, but other trades may\r\nhave adopted it, either in allusion to the text of every man “sitting\r\nunder his own fig-tree,” or because the fig-tree was a symbol of quiet\r\nunassuming industry; as such, at least, Camerarius represents it:--\r\n\r\n  “Verno tempore ficus arbor speciosis floribus aut fructuum præcocium\r\n  abundantia minime sese ostentat, nullamque inanem hominibus de se spem\r\n  injicit: in autumno autem fructus suaviss. ac quidem in illis\r\n  reconditos quasi flores quosdam proferre solet.”[354]\r\n\r\nThe ALMOND TREE was the sign of John Webster in St Paul’s Churchyard, in\r\n1663; and the PEACH TREE occurs sometimes as an ale-house sign, as, for\r\ninstance, in Nottingham. Neither of these signs, however, are of\r\nfrequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nNot only fruit-trees but various forest-trees are constantly met with on\r\nthe signboard: thus the GREEN TREE, which is very common, originally had\r\nallusion to the foresters of the “merry greenwood,” or was suggested by\r\nsome large evergreen, or tree sheltering, or standing near the inn; of\r\nthis green tree the GREEN SEEDLING in Chester is evidently a sprout.\r\nAgain, in Sheffield there are two signs of the BURNT TREE, which name\r\npossibly originated from some tree having been damaged in a fire, and\r\nbecoming a well-known landmark. The OAK, the vigorous emblem of our\r\nmighty state, is deservedly much used for a sign; sometimes it is called\r\nthe BRITISH OAK. At Kilpeck, in Herefordshire, the following rhyme\r\naccompanies it:--\r\n\r\n  “I am an oak and not a yew,\r\n  So drink a cup with good John Pugh.”\r\n\r\nDruidical recollections are called up by the OAK AND IVY, at Bilston,\r\nStafford; HEARTS OF OAK is the material out of which, according to the\r\nsong, our ships and seamen are constructed, and therefore well deserves\r\nthe favourite place it occupies amongst the signboards of the present\r\nday; whilst the ACORN, the fruit of the British oak, is nearly as common\r\nas the other oak signs.\r\n\r\nNext to the oak the ELM seems to have had most followers. From the\r\ntrades tokens it appears that the THREE ELMS was the sign of Edward\r\nBoswell in Chandos Street, in 1667; and also of Isaac Elliotson, St John\r\nStreet, Clerkenwell. Besides these there was, about the same date, the\r\nONE ELM, and the ELM. At present we have the NINE ELMS, and the QUEEN’S\r\nELM, Brompton, which is mentioned under the name of the QUEEN’S TREE, in\r\nthe parish books of 1586. This tree is said to derive its name from the\r\nfact of Queen Elizabeth, when on a visit to Lord Burleigh, being caught\r\nin a shower of rain, and taking shelter under the branches of an\r\nelm-tree, then growing on this spot. The SEVEN SISTERS, the sign of two\r\npublic-houses in Tottenham, were seven elm-trees, planted in a circular\r\nform, with a walnut tree in the middle; they were upwards of 500 years\r\nold, and the local tradition said that a martyr had been burnt on that\r\nspot. They stood formerly at the entrance from the high road at Page\r\nGreen, Tottenham. Within the last twenty years they have been removed.\r\nThe CHESTNUT, the SYCAMORE, the BEECH TREE, the FIR TREE, the BIRCH\r\nTREE, and the ASH TREE, all occur in various places where ale-houses are\r\nbuilt in the shadow of such trees. The THORN TREE is peculiar to\r\nDerbyshire. The BUCKTHORN TREE was, in 1775, the sign of “William\r\nBlackwell in Covent Garden, or at his garden in South Lambeth.” He had\r\nchosen this sign because he sold, amongst other herbs, “_buckthorn_ and\r\nelder-berries, besides leeches and _vipers_.” What the use of the first\r\nwas is well known; as for the vipers, they were eaten in broth and\r\nsoups, before Madame Rachel’s enamels were employed, by ladies who\r\nwished to continue “young and beautiful for ever.” The CRAB TREE, our\r\nindigenous apple-tree, is also seen in a great many places. A house in\r\nFulham, with that name, is well known to the oarsmen on the Thames. It\r\nderives its denomination from a large crab-tree growing near the\r\npublic-house, which gave its name to the whole village. The WILLOW TREE\r\nis very rare; in the seventeenth century it was the sign of a shop in\r\nthe Old Exchange, as appears from a trades token, but what business was\r\ncarried on under this gloomy sign does not appear. Fuller, in his\r\nWorthies, (_voce_ Cambridgeshire,) says of willows:--\r\n\r\n  “A sad tree whereof such who have lost their love make them mourning\r\n  garlands; and we know that exiles hung their harps upon such doleful\r\n  supporters; the twiggs hereoff are physick to drive out the folly of\r\n  children. Let me add that if green ash may burn before a queen,\r\n  withered willows may be allowed to burn before a lady.”\r\n\r\nAs an attribute of forsaken love it is of constant occurrence in old\r\nplays:--\r\n\r\n    “_Sylli._ If you forsake me,\r\n  Send me word, that I may provide a _willow garland_\r\n  To wear when I drown myself.”\r\n\r\n  MASSINGER’S _Maid of Honour_, a. iv. s. 5, 1631.\r\n\r\nAnd in the same play Sylli, who thinks himself the preferred lover, says\r\nto his rival:--\r\n\r\n  “You may cry willow, willow!”--_Ibid._, a. v. s. 1.\r\n\r\nShakespeare uses the same emblem frequently, particularly in Desdemona’s\r\nfamous willow song. There is a quaint ballad which an old Northumberland\r\nwoman used to sing, but which we have never seen in print: it begins as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  “Young men are false, and they are so deceitful:\r\n  Young men are false, and they seldom will prove true;\r\n  For wi’ wrangling and jangling, their minds are always changing,\r\n  They’re always seeking for some pretty girl that’s new.\r\n\r\n  It’s all round my hat, I will wear a green willow,\r\n  It’s all round my hat for a twelvemonth and a day;\r\n  If any one should ask you the reason why I wear it,\r\n  Oh! tell them I have been slighted by my own true love.”\r\n\r\nDouce, in his “Illustrations to Shakespeare,” says:--This tree might\r\nhave been chosen as the symbol of sadness from the verse in Psalm\r\ncxxxvii.: “We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof;”\r\nor else from a coincidence between the weeping willow and falling tears.\r\nAnother reason has been assigned: the _Agnus castus_ or _vitex_ was\r\nsupposed by the ancients to promote chastity, “and the willow being of a\r\nmuch like nature,” says an old writer, “it is yet a custom that he which\r\nis deprived of his love must wear a willow garland.”--_Swan’s Speculum\r\nMundi_, ch. vi. sec. 4. 1635.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of the sign of the YEW TREE is not to be attributed to its\r\nassociation with the churchyard, but to its being the wood from which\r\nthose famous bows were made that did such execution at Agincourt and\r\nPoictiers, and wherever the English armies trod the field before the\r\ninvention of gunpowder. So great was the patronage our early kings\r\ngranted to the practice of the bow, that the patten-makers, by an Act of\r\nParliament of 4 Henry V., were forbidden, under a penalty of £5, to use\r\nin their craft any kind of wood fit to make arrows of.\r\n\r\nThe COTTON TREE is a sign generally put up in the neighbourhood of\r\ncotton factories, as at Manchester. The PALM TREE is one of the oldest\r\nsymbols known: it was used as such by the Assyrians, the Greeks, the\r\nRomans, and by them transmitted to the early Christians. St Ambrosius,\r\nin a very forcible image, compares the life of an early and faithful\r\nChristian to the palm tree, rough and rugged below, like its stem, but\r\nincreasing in beauty upwards, where it bears heavenly fruit. It might\r\nalso illustrate a more homely truth, namely, that business cannot\r\nflourish without patronage and custom; thus, Camerarius says:--\r\n\r\n  “Inter alias multas singulares proprietates quas scriptores rerum\r\n  naturalium Palmæ attribuunt, ista non postrema est, quod hæc arbor non\r\n  facile crescat, nisi radiis solaribus opt. foveatur nec non humore\r\n  aliquo conveniente irrigetur.”[355]\r\n\r\nThe COCOA TREE was frequently the sign of chocolate-houses when that\r\nbeverage was newly imported and very fashionable. One of the most famous\r\nwas in St James’ Street; it was, in the reign of Queen Anne, strictly a\r\nTory house:--“A Whig will no more go to the Cocoa Tree, or Ozinda’s,\r\n[another chocolate-house in the same neighbourhood,] than a Tory will be\r\nseen at the coffee-house of St James’.”[356] Deep play was the order of\r\nthe day in that as in all other fashionable resorts at the end of the\r\nlast century. Walpole, in 1780, wrote to one of his friends:--\r\n\r\n  “Within this week there has been a cast at hazard at the Cocoa Tree,\r\n  the difference of which amounted to an hundred and four score thousand\r\n  pounds. Mr O’Birne, an Irish gamester, had won £100,000 off a young Mr\r\n  Harvey, of Chigwell, just started from a midshipman into an estate by\r\n  his elder brother’s death. O’Birne said, ‘You can never pay me?’ ‘I\r\n  can,’ said the youth, ‘my estate will sell for the debt.’ ‘No,’ said\r\n  O., ‘I will win ten thousand, you shall throw for the odd ninety.’\r\n  They did, and Harvey won.”[357]\r\n\r\nIt afterwards became a club, of which Byron was a member. This gambling\r\nseems to have been inseparable from the chocolate-houses. Roger North,\r\nattorney-general to James II., says,--\r\n\r\n  “The use of coffee-houses seems newly improved by a new invention\r\n  called Chocolate-houses, for the benefit of rooks and cullies of all\r\n  the quality, where gaming is added to all the rest, and the summons of\r\n  wh---- seldom fails: as if the devil had erected a new university, and\r\n  those were the colleges of its professors, as well as his school of\r\n  discipline.”[358]\r\n\r\nChocolate was known in Germany as early as 1624, when Joan Franz. Rauch\r\nwrote a treatise against that beverage and the monks. In England,\r\nhowever, it seems to have been introduced much later, for in 1657 it was\r\nadvertised as a new drink:--\r\n\r\n  “IN BISHOPSGATE STREET, in Queen’s Head Alley, at a Frenchman’s house,\r\n  is an excellent West India drink called Chocolate to be sold, where\r\n  you may have it ready at any time, and also unmade, at reasonable\r\n  rates.”[359]\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to observe the fluctuating reputation of chocolate on its\r\nfirst introduction. M^{me}. de Sévigné, in her letters, gives many\r\nproofs of it; at one time she fervently recommends it to her daughter as\r\na perfect panacea, at other times she is as violently against it, and\r\nputs it down as the root of all evil.\r\n\r\nTHE COFFEE HOUSE is the now inappropriate sign of a gin-palace in\r\nChalton Street, Somers Town. Early in the last century this\r\nneighbourhood was a delightful rural suburb, with fields and flower\r\ngardens. A short distance down the hill was the then famous Bagnigge\r\nWells, and close by were the remains of Totten-Hall, with the Adam and\r\nEve tea-gardens, and the so-called King John’s Palace. Many foreign\r\nProtestant refugees had taken up their residence in this suburb, on\r\naccount of the retirement it afforded, and the low rates asked for the\r\nsmall houses. “THE COFFEE HOUSE” was then the popular tea and\r\ncoffee-gardens of the district, and was visited by the foreigners of the\r\nneighbourhood, as well as the pleasure-seeking Cockney from the distant\r\ncity. There were other public-houses and places of entertainment near at\r\nhand, but the specialty of this establishment was its coffee. As the\r\ntraffic increased, it became a posting-house, uniting the business of an\r\ninn to the profits of a pleasure garden. Gradually the demand for coffee\r\nfell off, and that for malt and spirituous liquors increased. At present\r\nthe gardens are all built over, and the old gateway forms part of the\r\nmodern bar; but there are aged persons in the neighbourhood who remember\r\nSunday-school excursions to the place, and pic-nic parties from the\r\ncrowded city, making merry here in the grounds.\r\n\r\nThe HOLLY BUSH is a common public-house sign at the present day. Among\r\nthe London trades tokens there is one of the HAND AND HOLLY BUSH at\r\nTemplebar, evidently the same inn mentioned in 1708 by Hatton, “on the\r\nnorth side, and about the middle of the backside of St Clements, near\r\nthe church.”[360] This combination with the hand does not seem to have\r\nany very distinct meaning, and apparently arose simply from the manner\r\nof representing objects in those days, as being held by a hand issuing\r\nfrom a cloud. Adorning houses and churches at Christmas with evergreens\r\nand holly is a very ancient custom, supposed, like some others of our\r\nold customs, to be derived from the Druids. Formerly the streets also\r\nappear to have been decked out, for Stow tells us that\r\n\r\n  “Against the feast of Christmas every man’s house, as also the parish\r\n  churches, were decked with holme, ivy, and bayes, and whatsoever the\r\n  season of the year afforded to be given. The conduits and standards in\r\n  the streets were likewise garnished.”\r\n\r\nThus flowers, fruit trees, and forest trees were represented on the\r\nsignboard, and with them even the homely but useful tenants of the\r\nkitchen garden found a place. The ARTICHOKE, above all, used to be a\r\ngreat favourite, and still gives a name to some public-houses. As a\r\nseedsman’s sign it was common and rational; not so for a milliner, yet\r\nboth among the Bagford and Banks’s shopbills there are several instances\r\nof its being the sign of that business; thus:--\r\n\r\n  “Susannah Fordham, att the HARTICHOAKE, in ye Royal Exchange,” in the\r\n  reign of Queen Anne, sold “all sorts of fine poynts, laces, and\r\n  linnens, and all sorts of gloves and ribons, and all other sorts of\r\n  millenary wares.”[361]\r\n\r\nProbably the novelty of the plant had more than anything else to do with\r\nthis selection; for though it was introduced in this country in the\r\nreign of King Henry VIII., yet Evelyn observes:--\r\n\r\n  “‘Tis not very long since this noble thistle came first into Italy,\r\n  improved to this magnitude by culture, and so rare in England that\r\n  they were commonly sold for a crowne a piece.”[362]\r\n\r\nThe CABBAGE is an ale-house sign at Hunslet, Leeds, and at Liverpool,\r\nand CABBAGE HALL, opposite Chaney Lane, on the road to the Lunatic\r\nAsylum, Oxford, was formerly the name of a public-house kept by a\r\ntailor; but whether he himself had christened it thus, or his customers\r\nhad a sly suspicion that it owed its origin to _cabbaging_, history has\r\nomitted to record. Another public-house, higher up the hill, was known\r\nby the name of CATERPILLAR HALL, a name clearly selected in compliment\r\nto Cabbage Hall, intimating that it meant to draw away the customers\r\nfrom Cabbage Hall, in other words, that the caterpillar would eat the\r\ncabbage. The OXNOBLE, a kind of potato, is the name of a public-house in\r\nManchester, and the homely mess of PEASE AND BEANS was a sign in Norwich\r\nin 1750.[363] The THREE RADISHES was, in the seventeenth century, a\r\ncommon nursery and market gardener’s sign in Holland. There was one near\r\nHaarlem, to which was added a representation of Christ appearing to Mary\r\nMagdalene in the garden, with this rhyme--\r\n\r\n  “Christus vertoont men hier\r\n  Na zyn dood in verryzen,\r\n  Als een groot hovenier\r\n  Die ieder een moet pryzen.\r\n  Dit ’s in de drie Radyzen.”[364]\r\n\r\nAnother, near Gouda, had a still more absurd inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Adam en Eva leefden in den Paradyze\r\n  Zelden aten zy stokvisch maar veel warmoes, kropsla en radyzen.\r\n  Hier vindt gy allerley aardgewas om menschen mêe te spyzen.”[365]\r\n\r\nThe WHEATSHEAF is an extremely common inn, public-house, and baker’s\r\nsign; it is a charge in the arms of these three corporations, besides\r\nthat of the brewers. In the middle of Farringdon Street, opposite the\r\nvegetable market, is Wheatsheaf Yard, once a famous waggon inn, which\r\nalso did a roaring trade in wine, spirits, and Fleet Street marriages.\r\nIndeed, most of the large inns within the liberties of the Fleet served\r\nas “marriage shops” between 1734 and 1749; amongst the most famous were\r\nthe BULL AND GARTER, the HOOP AND BUNCH OF GRAPES, the BISHOP BLAIZE AND\r\nTWO SAWYERS, the FIGHTING COCKS, and numerous others. The gateway\r\nentrance to the old coach-yard is adorned with very fine carvings of\r\nwheat ears and lions’ heads intermixed, finished in a manner not\r\nunworthy of Grinling Gibbons himself.\r\n\r\nThe OATSHEAF is very rare; it was the sign of a shop in Cree Church\r\nLane, Leadenhall Street, in the seventeenth century, as appears from a\r\ntrades token; but this seems the only instance of the sign.\r\n\r\nWith these plants we may also class Tobacco, that best abused of all\r\nweeds. Sometimes we see a pictorial representation of the TOBACCO PLANT,\r\nbut most usually it occurs in the form of TOBACCO ROLLS, representing\r\ncoils of the so-called spun or twist tobacco, otherwise pigtail, for the\r\nsake of ornament, painted brown and gold alternately. Decker, in his\r\n“Gull’s Hornbook,” mentions _Roll Trinidado_, leaf, and pudding tobacco,\r\nwhich probably were the three sorts smokers at that day preferred. That\r\nit was used mixed may be conjectured from the introduction to “Cinthia’s\r\nRevels,” a play by Ben Jonson; one of the interlocutors says,--“I have\r\nmy three sorts of tobacco in my pocket.”\r\n\r\n[326] “The Country Carbonadoed,” by D.

The stocking denoted\r\nthe hosier, the gridiron the ironmonger, and so on. The early\r\nbooksellers, whose trade lay chiefly in religious books, delighted in\r\nsigns of saints, but at the Reformation the BIBLE amongst those classes,\r\nto whom till then it had been a sealed book, became in great request,\r\nand was sold in large numbers. Then the booksellers set it up for their\r\nsign; it became the popular symbol of the trade, and at the present\r\nmoment instances of its use still linger with us. There was one day in\r\nthe year, St Bartholomew’s, the 24th of August, when their shops\r\ndisplayed nothing but Bibles and Prayer-books. It is not impossible that\r\nthis may have been originally intended for a manifestation against\r\nPopery, since it was the anniversary of the dreadful Protestant massacre\r\nin Paris in 1572. The following, however, is the only allusion we have\r\nmet with relating to this custom:--“Like a bookseller’s shop on\r\nBartholomew day at London, the stalls of which are so adorned with\r\nBibles and Prayer-books, that almost nothing is left within but heathen\r\nknowledge.”[366]\r\n\r\nOne of the last BIBLE signs was about twenty years ago, at a\r\npublic-house in Shire Lane, Temple Bar. It was an old established house\r\nof call for printers.\r\n\r\nThe Bible being such a common sign, booksellers had to “wear their rue\r\nwith a difference,” as Ophelia says, and adopt different colours,\r\namongst which the BLUE BIBLE was one of the most common. “Prynne’s\r\nHistrio-Mastrix” was “printed for Michael Sparke, and sold at the Blue\r\nBible, in Green Arbour Court, Little Old Bailey, 1632.” This blue\r\ncolour, so common on the signboard, was not chosen without meaning, but\r\non account of its symbolic virtue. Blue, from its permanency, being an\r\nemblem of truth, hence Lydgate, speaking of Delilah, Samson’s mistress,\r\nin his translation from Boccacio, (MS. Harl. 2251,) says--\r\n\r\n  “Insteade of _blew, which steadfaste is and clene_,\r\n  She weraed colours of many a diverse grene.”\r\n\r\nIt also signified piety and sincerity. Randle Holme[367] says--\r\n\r\n  “This colour, _blew_, doth represent the sky on a clear, sun-shining\r\n  day, when all clouds are exiled. Job, speaking to the busy searchers\r\n  of God’s mysteries, saith (Job xi. 17,) ‘That then shall the residue\r\n  of their lives be as clear as the noonday.’ Which to the judgment of\r\n  men (through the pureness of the air) is of _azure_ colour or light\r\n  _blew_, and signifieth _piety and sincerity_.”\r\n\r\nOther booksellers chose the THREE BIBLES, which was a very common sign\r\nof the trade on London Bridge in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies: of one of them, Charles Tyne, trades tokens are\r\nextant,--great curiosities to the numismatist, as booksellers were not\r\nin the habit of issuing them. The sign of the Three Bibles seems to have\r\noriginated from the stationers’ arms, which are _arg._ on a chevron\r\nbetween _three bibles_, _or_ a falcon volant between two roses, the Holy\r\nGhost in chief. One bookseller, on account of his selling stationery,\r\nalso added _three inkbottles_ to the favourite three Bibles, as we see\r\nfrom an advertisement, giving the price of playing cards in 1711:--\r\n\r\n  “Sold by Henry Parson, Stationer at the THREE BIBLES AND THREE\r\n  INKBOTTLES, near St Magnus’ Church, on London Bridge, the best\r\n  principal superfine Picket Cards, at 2s. 6d. a dozen; the best\r\n  principal Ombro Cards, at 2s. 9d. a dozen; the best principal\r\n  superfine Basset Cards, at 3s. 6d. a dozen; with all other Cards and\r\n  Stationery Wares at Reasonable Rates.”[368]\r\n\r\nCombinations of the Bible with other objects were very common, some of\r\nthem symbolic, as the BIBLE AND CROWN, which sign originated during the\r\npolitical troubles in the reign of Charles I. It was at this time when\r\nthe clergy and the court party constantly tried to convince the people\r\nof the divine prerogative of the Crown, that the “Bible and Crown”\r\nbecame the standing toast of the Cavaliers and those opposed to the\r\nParliament leaders. As a sign it has been used for a century and a half\r\nby the firm of Rivington the publishers. The old wood carving, painted\r\nand gilt in the style of the early signs, was taken down from over the\r\nshop in Paternoster Row in 1853, when this firm removed westward. It is\r\nstill in their possession. Cobbett, the political agitator and\r\npublisher, in the beginning of this century chose the sign of the BIBLE,\r\nCROWN, AND CONSTITUTION; but the general tenor of his life was such,\r\nthat his enemies said he put them up merely that he might afterwards be\r\nable to say he had pulled them down. A BIBLE, SCEPTRE, AND CROWN,\r\ncarved in wood, may still be seen on the top of an ale-house of that\r\nname in High Holborn. The crown and sceptre in this case are placed on\r\ntwo closed Bibles.\r\n\r\nThe BIBLE AND LAMB, _i.e._, the Holy Lamb, we find mentioned in an\r\nadvertisement in the _Publick Advertiser_, March 1, 1759--\r\n\r\n  “To be had at the BIBLE AND LAMB, near Temple Bar, on the Strand Side,\r\n  the Skin for Pains in the Limbs, Price 2s.”\r\n\r\nBooks also were sold here, for in those days booksellers and toyshops\r\nwere the usual repositories for quack medicines.\r\n\r\nThe BIBLE AND DOVE, _i.e._, the Holy Ghost, was the sign of John Penn,\r\nbookseller, over against St Bride’s Church, Fleet Street, 1718; and the\r\nBIBLE AND PEACOCK, the sign of Benjamin Crayle, bookseller, at the west\r\nend of St Paul’s, in 1688. If not a combination of two signs, the bird\r\nmay have been added on account of its being the type of the\r\nResurrection, in which quality it is found represented in the Catacombs,\r\na symbolism arising from the supposed incorruptibility of its\r\nflesh.[369] Various other combinations occur, as the BIBLE AND KEY.\r\nRowland Hall, a printer of the sixteenth century, had for his sign the\r\nHALF EAGLE AND KEY, (see Heraldic Signs,) of which the Bible and Key may\r\nbe a free imitation. It was the sign of B. Dod, bookseller, in Ave Maria\r\nLane, 1761; whilst the GOLDEN KEY AND BIBLE was that of L. Stoke, a\r\nbookseller at Charing Cross, 1711. The “Bible and Key” is also the name\r\nof a certain Coscinomanteia, somewhat similar to the Sortes Virgilianæ.\r\nThis method of divination was performed in two ways, in the first,\r\n(stated by Matthew of Paris to have been frequently practised at the\r\nelection of bishops,) the Bible was opened on the altar, and the\r\nprediction taken from the chapter which first caught the eye on opening\r\nthe book; the other was by placing two written papers, one negative, the\r\nother affirmative, of the matter in question, under the pall of the\r\naltar, which, after solemn prayers, was believed would be decided by\r\ndivine judgment. Gregory of Tours mentions another method by the\r\nPsalms.[370]\r\n\r\nAt the present day “Bible and Key” divinations are often attempted by\r\nthose who believe in fortune-telling and vaticinations. The method\r\nadopted is as follows:--A key is placed, with the bow or handle sticking\r\nout, between the leaves of a Bible, on Ruth i. 16:\r\n\r\n  “And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from\r\n  following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where\r\n  thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people, and thy God\r\n  my God.”\r\n\r\nThe Bible is then firmly tied up, most effectually with a garter, and\r\nbalanced by the bow of the key on the fore-fingers of the right hands of\r\ntwo persons, the one who wishes to consult the oracle, the other any\r\nperson standing near. The book is then addressed with these\r\nwords--“Pray, Mr Bible, be good enough to tell me if ---- or not?” If\r\nthe question be answered in the affirmative the key will swing round,\r\nturn off the finger, and the Bible fall down; if in the negative, it\r\nwill remain steady in its position. Not only upon matrimonial, but upon\r\nall sorts of questions, this oracle may be consulted.\r\n\r\nFurther combinations are the BIBLE AND SUN. The SUN was the sign of\r\nWynkyn de Worde, and the printers that succeeded him in his house. It\r\nmay, however, in this combination have been an emblem of the Sun of\r\nTruth, or the Light of the World. It was the sign of J. Newberry, in St\r\nPaul’s Churchyard, the publisher of Goldsmith’s “Vicar of Wakefield;”\r\nalso of C. Bates, near Pie Corner; and of Richard Reynolds, in the\r\nPoultry, both ballad printers in the times of Charles II. and William\r\nIII. Then there is the BIBLE AND BALL, a sign of a bookseller in Ave\r\nMaria Lane in 1761, who probably hung up a Globe to indicate the sale of\r\nglobes and maps; and the BIBLE AND DIAL, over against St Dunstan’s\r\nChurch, Fleet Street, in 1720, was the sign of the notorious Edmund\r\nCurll, who was pilloried at Charing Cross, and pilloried in Pope’s\r\nverses. _The Dial_ was, in all likelihood, a sun-dial on the front wall\r\nof his house.\r\n\r\nOf the Apocryphal Books there is only one example among the signboards,\r\nviz., BEL AND THE DRAGON, which was at one time not uncommon, more\r\nparticularly with apothecaries. It was represented by a Bell and a\r\nDragon, as appears from the _Spectator_, No. 28. “One Apocryphical\r\nHeathen God is also represented by this figure [of a Bell], which, in\r\nconjunction with the Dragon, makes a very handsome picture in several of\r\nour streets.” Although at the first glance this sign seems taken from\r\nthe doubtful books of the Old Testament, still there is nothing in the\r\nApocryphal book which could in any way prompt the choice of it for a\r\nsignboard. After all, it may possibly be only a combination, or\r\ncorruption, of two other signs. There still remain a few public-houses\r\nwhich employ it,--as in Worship Street; at Cookham, Maidenhead; at\r\nNorton in the Moors, &c., whilst in Boss Street, Horsely Down, there is\r\na variation in the form of the BELL AND GRIFFIN. From a handbill of\r\nTopham, the Strong Man,[371] we see that it was vulgarly called the KING\r\nASTYAGES ARMS, for no better reason than because King Astyages is the\r\nfirst name in the story: the incident related in the Book of Bel and the\r\nDragon having taken place after his death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.\r\n\r\nHOLE IN THE WALL.\r\n\r\n(“Guide for Malt-Worms.” Circa 1720.)\r\n\r\nSTAR, OR BUSH.\r\n\r\n(MS., circa 1425.)\r\n\r\nBARLEY MOW.\r\n\r\n(Hogarth’s print of Beer St.)\r\n\r\nDOG AND DUCK.\r\n\r\n(In the brick wall of Bethlehem Hospital.)\r\n\r\nFLYING HORSE.\r\n\r\n(“Guide for Malt-Worms.” Circa 1720.)]\r\n\r\nA very common sign of old, as well as at present, is the ADAM AND EVE.\r\nOur first parents were constant _dramatis personæ_ in the mediæval\r\nmysteries and pageants, on which occasions, with the _naïveté_ of those\r\ntimes, Eve used to come on the stage exactly in the same costume as she\r\nappeared to Adam before the Fall.[372] The sign was adopted by various\r\ntrades, including the publishers of books, as we may see from the\r\nfollowing quaint title:--\r\n\r\n  “A Protestant Picture of Jesus Christ, drawn in Scripture colours,\r\n  both for light to sinners and delight to saints. By Tho. Sympson,\r\n  M.A., Preacher of the Word at London. Sold by Edw. Thomas at the _Adam\r\n  and Eve_, in Little Britain. 1662.”\r\n\r\nIn Newgate Street there yet remains an old stone sign of the Adam and\r\nEve, with the date 1669. Eve is represented handing the apple to Adam,\r\nthe fatal tree is in the centre, round its stem the serpent winding. It\r\nwas the arms of the fruiterers’ company.\r\n\r\nThere is still an Adam and Eve public-house in the High Street,\r\nKensington, where Sheridan, on his way to and from Holland House, used\r\nto refresh himself, and in this way managed to run up rather a long\r\nbill, which Lord Holland had to pay for him. A still older place of\r\npublic entertainment was the Adam and Eve Tea-gardens, in Tottenham\r\nCourt Road, part of which was the last remaining vestige “of the once\r\nrespectable, if not magnificent, manor-house appertaining to the Lords\r\nof Tottenhall.” Richardson, in 1819, said that the place had long been\r\ncelebrated as a tea-garden; there was an organ in the long room, and the\r\ncompany was generally respectable, till the end of last century, when\r\nhighwaymen, footpads, pickpockets, and low women, beginning to take a\r\nfancy to it, the magistrates interfered. The organ was banished, and the\r\ngardens were dug up for the foundation of Eden Street. In these gardens\r\nLunardi came down after his unsuccessful balloon ascent from the\r\nArtillery ground, May 16, 1783. Hogarth has represented the Adam and Eve\r\nin the March of the Guards to Finchley. Upon the signboard of the house\r\nis inscribed, “Tottenham Court Nursery,” in allusion to Broughton’s\r\nAmphitheatre for Boxing, erected in this place. How amusing is this\r\nadvertisement of the great Professor’s “Nursery:”--\r\n\r\n  “From the _Gymnasium_ at _Tottenham Court_\r\n  on _Thursday next at Twelve o’clock will begin_:\r\n\r\nA lecture on Manhood or Gymnastic Physiology, wherein the whole Theory\r\nand Practice of the Art of Boxing will be fully explained by various\r\nOperators on the animal Œconomy and the Principles of Championism,\r\nillustrated by proper Experiments on the Solids and Fluids of the Body;\r\ntogether with the True Method of investigating the Nature of all Blows,\r\nStops, Cross Buttocks, etc., incident to Combatants. The whole leading\r\nto the most successful Method of beating a Man deaf, dumb, lame, and\r\nblind.\r\n\r\n  by THOMAS SMALLWOOD, A.M.,\r\n  _Gymnasiast of St. Giles_,\r\n  and\r\n  THOMAS DIMMOCK, A.M.,\r\n  _Athleta of Southwark_,\r\n  (Both fellows of the _Athletic Society_.)\r\n\r\n⁂ The Syllabus or Compendium for the use of students in Athleticks,\r\nreferring to Matters explained in this Lecture, may be had of Mr\r\nProfessor Broughton at the CROWN in Market Lane, where proper\r\ninstructions in the Art and Practice of Boxing are delivered without\r\nLoss of Eye or Limb to the student.”\r\n\r\nThe tree with the forbidden fruit, always represented in the sign of\r\nAdam and Eve, leads directly to the FLAMING SWORD, “which turned every\r\nway to keep the way of the tree of life.” Being the first sword on\r\nrecord, it was not inappropriately a cutler’s sign, and as such we find\r\nit in the Banks Collection, on the shop-bill of a sword cutler in\r\nSweeting’s Alley, Royal Exchange, 1780. It is less appropriate at the\r\ndoor of a public-house in Nottingham, for the landlord evidently cannot\r\ndesire to keep anybody out, whether saint or sinner. The vessel by which\r\nthe life of the first planter of the vine was preserved, certainly well\r\ndeserves to decorate the tavern: hence NOAH’S ARK is not an uncommon\r\npublic-house sign, though it looks very like a sarcastic reflection on\r\nthe mixed crowd that resort to the house,--not to escape the “heavy\r\nwet,” as the animals at the Deluge, but in order to obtain some of it.\r\nToy-shops also constantly use it, since Noah’s Ark is generally the\r\nfavourite toy of children. Evelyn, in 1644, mentions a shop near the\r\nPalais de Justice in Paris:\r\n\r\n  “Here is a shop called Noah’s Ark, where are sold all curiosities,\r\n  natural or artificial, Indian or European, for luxury or use, as\r\n  cabinets, shells, ivory, porcelain, dried fishes, insects, birds,\r\n  pictures, and a thousand exotic extravagances.”[373]\r\n\r\nThe Deluge was one of the standard subjects of mediæval dramatic plays.\r\nIn the third part of the Chester Whitsun plays, for instance, Noah and\r\nthe Flood make a considerable item; and at a much later period the same\r\nsubject was exhibited at Bartholomew Fair. A bill of the time of Queen\r\nAnne[374] informs us that--\r\n\r\n  “At Crawley’s Booth, over against the Crown Tavern in Smithfield,\r\n  during the time of Bartholomew Fair, will be presented a little Opera,\r\n  called the Old Creation of the World, yet newly revived, with the\r\n  addition of _Noah’s Flood_; also several fountains playing water\r\n  during the time of the play. The last scene presents Noah and his\r\n  family coming out of the Ark, with all the beasts, two by two, and all\r\n  the fowls of the air, seen in a prospect, sitting upon trees. Likewise\r\n  over the Ark is seen the sun rising in a most glorious manner:\r\n  moreover, a multitude of angels will be seen, in a double rank, which\r\n  presents a double prospect--one for the sun, the other for a palace,\r\n  where will be seen 6 angels ringing of bells, etc.”\r\n\r\nThe Deluge was the mystery performed at Whitsuntide by the company of\r\ndyers in London, and from this their sign of the DOVE AND RAINBOW might\r\nhave originated, unless it were adopted by them on account of the\r\nvarious colours of the rainbow. On the bill of John Edwards, a silk-dyer\r\nin Aldersgate Street, the Dove, with an olive branch in her mouth, is\r\nrepresented flying underneath the Rainbow, over a landscape, with\r\nvillages, fenced fields, and a gentleman in the costume of the reign of\r\nCharles II. Besides this there are various other dyers’ bills with the\r\nsign of the DOVE AND RAINBOW, both among the Bagford and Banks\r\nCollections. A few public-houses at the present day still keep up the\r\nmemory of the sign; there is one at Nottingham, and another in\r\nLeicester.\r\n\r\n“ABRAHAM OFFERING HIS SON” was the sign of a shop in Norwich in 1750. A\r\nstone bas-relief of the same subject (_Le Sacrifice d’Abraham_) is still\r\nremaining in the front of a house in the Rue des Prêtres, Lille,\r\nFrance. A Dutch wood-merchant, in the seventeenth century, also put up\r\nthis sign, and illustrated its application by the following rhyme:--\r\n\r\n  “‘T Hout is gehakt, opdat men ’t zou branden,\r\n  Daarom is dit in Abram’s Offerhande.”[375]\r\n\r\nThus, though the wood of the sacrifice played a very insignificant part\r\nin the story, yet the simple mention of it was enough to make it a fit\r\nsubject for a Dutchman’s signboard. We have a similar instance in\r\nJACOB’S WELL, which is common in London, as well as in the country. The\r\nallusion here is to the well at which Christ met the woman of Samaria,\r\nwho said to him:\r\n\r\n  “Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and\r\n  drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? Jesus\r\n  answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall\r\n  thirst again.” (S. John iv. 12.)\r\n\r\nHow cruelly these words apply to the gin-tap, at which generation after\r\ngeneration drink, and after which they always thirst again. Not unlikely\r\nthe English use of this sign dates from the Puritan period.[376] Not\r\nalways, however, had the sign any direct relation to the trade of the\r\ninmate of the house which it adorned; as, for example, MOSES AND AARON,\r\nwhich occurs on a trades token of Whitechapel. In allusion to this, or a\r\nsimilar sign, Tom Brown says, “Other amusements presented themselves as\r\nthick as hops, as Moses pictured with horns, to keep Cheapside in\r\ncountenance.”[377] Even the Dutch shopkeeper, whose imagination was\r\ngenerally so fertile in finding a religious subject appropriate as his\r\ntrade sign, was at a loss what to do with Moses; for a baker in\r\nAmsterdam, in the seventeenth century, put up the sign of Moses, with\r\nthis inscription:\r\n\r\n      “Moses wierd gevist in het water,\r\n  Die hier waar haalt krygt vry gist, een Paaschbrood,\r\n      En op Korstyd een Deuvekater.”[378]\r\n\r\nIn London, however, the use of this sign may at first have been\r\nsuggested by the statues of Moses and Aaron that used to stand above the\r\nbalcony of the Old Guildhall. Connected with the history of Moses, we\r\nfind several other signs, one in particular, mentioned by Ned Ward as\r\nthe OLD PHARAOH in the town of Barley, in Cambridgeshire. It was so\r\nnamed, says he, “from a stout, elevating malt liquor of the same name,\r\nfor which this house had been long famous.”[379] Why this beer was\r\ncalled Pharaoh, Ned Ward does not seem to have known; but a story in the\r\ncounty is current that it was so named because the beer, like the\r\nEgyptian king of old, “would not let the people go!” It is now no longer\r\ndrunk in England, but a certain strong beer of the same name is still a\r\nfavourite beverage in Belgium. Next, in chronological order, connected\r\nwith the history of Moses, follows the BRAZEN SERPENT, the sign of\r\nReynold Wolfe, a bookseller and printer in St Paul’s Churchyard, 1544,\r\nand also of both his apprentices, Henry Binneman and John Shepperde. It\r\nhad probably been imported by the foreign printers, for it was a\r\nfavourite amongst the early French and German booksellers. At the\r\npresent day it is a public-house sign in Richardson Street, Bermondsey.\r\nWhat led to the adoption of this emblem was not the historical\r\nassociation, but the mystical meaning which it had in the middle ages:--\r\n\r\n  “A serpent torqued with a long cross; others blazon Christ, supporting\r\n  the brazen serpent, because it was an anti-type of the passion and\r\n  death of our Saviour; for as Moses lifted up the serpent in the\r\n  wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, (Num. xxi. 8, 9; John\r\n  iii. 14,) that all that behold him, by a lively faith, may not perish,\r\n  but have everlasting life. This is the cognizance or crest of every\r\n  true believer.”[380]\r\n\r\nThe idea was no doubt borrowed from the Biblia Pauperum. The BALAAM’S\r\nASS, again, was one of the _dramatis personæ_ in the Whitsuntide mystery\r\nof the company of cappers, (cap-makers,) and this is the only reason we\r\ncan imagine for his having found his way to the signboard. It occurs in\r\n1722 in a newspaper paragraph, concerning a child born without a\r\nstomach, the details of which are too nauseous to be introduced\r\nhere.[381]\r\n\r\nThe TWO SPIES is the last sign belonging to the history of Moses; it\r\nrepresents two of the spies that went into Canaan, “and cut down from\r\nthence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two\r\nupon a staff,” (Num. xiii. 23.) This bunch of grapes made it a favourite\r\nwith publicans; at many places it may still be seen, as in Catherine\r\nStreet, Strand, (a house of old standing;) in Long Acre, &c. In Great\r\nWindmill Street, Leicester Square, it has been corrupted into the THREE\r\nSPIES.\r\n\r\nAfter Moses there is a blank until we come to SAMSON, to whom our\r\nnational admiration for athletic sports and muscular strength has given\r\na prominent place on the signboard. SAMSON AND THE LION occurs on the\r\nsign of various houses in London in the seventeenth century, as appears\r\nfrom the trades tokens. It is still of frequent occurrence in country\r\ntowns, as at Dudley, Coventry, &c. It was also used on the Continent. In\r\nParis there is, or was, not many years ago, a _della Robbia_ ware\r\nmedallion sign in the Rue des Dragons, with the legend “_le Fort\r\nSamson_,” representing the strong man tearing open the lion. To a sign\r\nof SAMSON at Dordrecht, in the seventeenth century, the following\r\nsatirical inscription had been added:--\r\n\r\n  “Toen Samson door zyn kracht de leeuw belemmen kon,\r\n  De Philistynen sloeg, de vossen overwon.\r\n  Wiert hy nog door een Vrouw van zyn gezigt beroofd,\r\n  Gelooft geen vrouw dan of zy moet zyn zonder hoofd.”[382]\r\n\r\nThis admiration of strong men, which procured the signboard honours to\r\nSamson, also made GOLIAH, or GOLIAS, a great favourite. In the Horse\r\nMarket, Castle Barnard, he is actually treated just like a duke,\r\nadmiral, or any other public-house hero, for there the sign is entitled\r\nthe GOLIAH HEAD. Some doubts, however, may be entertained whether by\r\nGolias or Goliah, (for the name is spelt both ways,) the Philistine\r\ngiant and champion was always intended. Towards the end of the twelfth\r\ncentury there lived a man of wit, with the real or assumed name of\r\nGolias, who wrote the “Apocalypsis Goliæ,” and other burlesque verses.\r\nHe was the leader of a jovial sect called Goliardois, of which Chaucer’s\r\nMiller was one. “He was a jangler and a goliardeis.” Such a person\r\nmight, therefore, have been a very appropriate tutelary deity for an\r\nalehouse.[383]\r\n\r\nGoliah’s conqueror, KING DAVID, liberally shared the honours with his\r\nvictim, and he still figures on various signboards. There is a KING\r\nDAVID’S inn in Bristol, and a DAVID AND HARP in Limehouse; whilst in\r\nParis, the Rue de la Harpe is said to owe its name to a sign of King\r\nDavid playing on the harp. David’s unfortunate son, ABSALOM, was a\r\nperuke-maker’s very expressive emblem, both in France and in England, to\r\nshow the utility of wigs. Thus a barber at a town in Northamptonshire\r\nused this inscription:\r\n\r\n  “ABSALOM, hadst thou worn a perriwig, thou hadst not been hanged.”\r\n\r\nWhich a brother peruke-maker versified, under a sign representing the\r\ndeath of Absalom, with David weeping. He wrote up thus:\r\n\r\n  “Oh Absalom! oh Absalom!\r\n    Oh Absalom! my son,\r\n  If thou hadst worn a perriwig,\r\n    Thou hadst not been undone.”\r\n\r\nPsalm xlii. seems to be very profanely hinted at in the sign of the\r\nWHITE HART AND FOUNTAIN, Royal Mint Street, which, if not a combination\r\nof two well-known signs, apparently alludes to the words, “As the hart\r\npanteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.”\r\nTHE PANTING HART (_het dorstige Hert_, or _het Heigent Hert_,) was\r\nformerly a very common beer-house sign in Holland. In the seventeenth\r\ncentury there was one with the following inscription at Amsterdam:--\r\n\r\n  “Gelyk het hert by frisch water sig komt te verblyden,\r\n  Komt also in myn huys om u van dorst te bevryden.”[384]\r\n\r\nAnother one at Leyden had the following rhyme:--\r\n\r\n  “Gelyk een hart van jagen moe lust te drinken water rein,\r\n  Also verkoopt men hier tot versterking van de maag, toebak, bier en\r\n  Brandewyn.”[385]\r\n\r\nThe wise king Solomon does not appear to have ever been honoured with a\r\nsignboard portrait, but his enthusiastic admirer, the QUEEN OF SABA,\r\nfigured before the tavern kept by Dick Tarlton the jester, in\r\nGracechurch Street. This Queen of Saba, or Sheba, was a usual figure in\r\npageants. There is a letter of Secretary Barlow, in “Nugæ Antiquæ,”\r\ntelling how the Queen of Sheba fell down and upset her casket in the lap\r\nof the King of Denmark--when on his drunken visit to James I.--who “got\r\nnot a little defiled with the presents of the queen; such as wine,\r\ncream, jelly, beverages, cakes, spices, and other good matters.”\r\n\r\nDouce, in his “Illustrations to Shakespeare,” has a very ingenious\r\nexplanation for the sign of the BELL SAVAGE, as derived from the QUEEN\r\nOF SABA, which though _non è vero, ma ben trovato_. He bases his\r\nargument on a poem of the fourteenth century, the “Romaunce of Kyng\r\nAlisaundre,” wherein the Queen of Saba is thus mentioned:--\r\n\r\n  “In heore lond is a cité,\r\n  On of the noblest in Christianté,\r\n  Hit hotith Sabba in langage,\r\n  Thence cam _Sibely Savage_.\r\n  Of all the world the fairest queene,\r\n  To Jerusalem Salomon to seone.\r\n  For hire fair head and for hire love,\r\n  Salomon forsok his God above.”[386]\r\n\r\nELISHA’S RAVEN, represented with a chop in his mouth, is the sign of a\r\nbutcher in the Borough,--a curious conceit, and certainly his own\r\ninvention; at least we do not remember any other instance of the sign.\r\nThis tribute is certainly very disinterested in the butcher, for if\r\nthere were any such ravens now, it is probable that they would sadly\r\ninterfere with the trade.\r\n\r\nFew signs have undergone so many changes as the well-known SALUTATION.\r\nOriginally it represented the angel saluting the Virgin Mary, in which\r\nshape it was still occasionally seen in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies, as appears from the tavern token of Daniel Grey of Holborn.\r\nIn the times of the Commonwealth, however, “sacrarum ut humanarum rerum,\r\nheu! vicissitudo est,” the Puritans changed it into the SOLDIER AND\r\nCITIZEN, and in such a garb it continued long after, with this\r\nmodification, that it was represented by two citizens politely bowing to\r\neach other. The Salutation Tavern in Billingsgate shows it thus on its\r\ntrades token, and so it was represented by the Salutation Tavern in\r\nNewgate Street, (an engraving of which sign may still be seen in the\r\nparlour of that old established house.) At present it is mostly rendered\r\nby two hands conjoined, as at the Salutation Hotel, Perth, where a label\r\nis added with the words, “You’re welcome to the city.” That Salutation\r\nTavern in Billingsgate was a famous place in Ben Jonson’s time; it is\r\nnamed in “Bartholomew Fayre” as one of the houses where there had been\r\n\r\n              “Great sale and utterance of wine,\r\n  Besides beere and ale, and ipocras fine.”\r\n\r\nDuring the civil war there was a Salutation Tavern in Holborn, in which\r\nthe following ludicrous incident happened,--if we may believe the\r\nRoyalist papers:--\r\n\r\n  “A hotte combat lately happened at the Salutation Taverne in Holburne,\r\n  where some of the Commonwealth vermin, called soldiers, had seized on\r\n  an Amazonian Virago, named Mrs Strosse, upon suspicion of being a\r\n  loyalist, and selling the Man in the Moon; but shee, by applying\r\n  beaten pepper to their eyes, disarmed them, and with their own swordes\r\n  forced them to aske her forgiveness; and down on their mary bones, and\r\n  pledge a health to the king, and confusion to their masters, and so\r\n  honourablie dismissed them. Oh! for twenty thousand such gallant\r\n  spirits; when you see that one woman can beat two or three.”[387]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the last century there was a Salutation Tavern in\r\nTavistock Row, called also “Mr Bunch’s,” which was one of the elegant\r\nhaunts, patronised by “the first gentleman of Europe,” otherwise the\r\nPrince Regent. Lord Surrey and Sheridan were generally his associates in\r\nthese _escapades_. The trio went under the pseudonyms of Blackstock,\r\nGreystock, and Thinstock, and disguised in bob wigs and smockfrocks. The\r\nnight’s entertainment generally concluded with thrashing the “Charlies,”\r\nwrenching off knockers, breaking down signboards, and not unfrequently\r\nwith being taken to the roundhouse.\r\n\r\nThe Salutation in Newgate Street, some time called the SALUTATION AND\r\nCAT, (a combination of two signs,) was haunted by many of the great\r\nauthors of the last century. There is a _poetical_ invitation extant to\r\na social feast held at this tavern, January 19, 1735/6, issued by the\r\ntwo stewards, Edward Cave (of the _Gentleman’s Magazine_,) and William\r\nBowyer, the antiquary and printer:--\r\n\r\n  “Saturday, January 17, 1735/6.\r\n\r\n  “SIR,\r\n\r\n  You’re desired on Monday next to meet,\r\n  At _Salutation Tavern_, Newgate Street,\r\n  Supper will be on table just at eight.\r\n  (Stewards) one of St John, [Bowyer,] t’other of St John’s Gate,\r\n  [Cave.]”\r\n\r\nRichardson the novelist was one of the _invités_. He returned a poetical\r\nanswer, too long to quote at length: the following is part of it:--\r\n\r\n  “For me, I’m much concern’d I cannot meet\r\n  At _Salutation Tavern_, Newgate Street.\r\n  Your notice, like your verse, (so sweet and short!)\r\n  If longer I’d sincerely thank’d you for it.\r\n  Howev’r, receive my wishes, sons of verse!\r\n  May every man who meets your praise rehearse!\r\n  May mirth as plenty crown your cheerful board!\r\n  And every one part happy, ---- as a lord!\r\n  That when at home by such sweet verses fir’d,\r\n  Your families may think you all inspir’d.\r\n  So wishes he, who, pre-engag’d can’t know\r\n  The pleasures that would from your meeting flow.”\r\n\r\nIn this tavern Coleridge the poet, in one of his melancholy moods, lived\r\nfor some time in seclusion, until found out by Southey, and persuaded by\r\nhim to return to his usual mode of life. Sir T. N. Talfourd, in his Life\r\nof Charles Lamb, informs us that here Coleridge was in the habit of\r\nmeeting Lamb when in town on a visit from the University. Christ’s\r\nHospital, their old school, was within a few paces of the place:--\r\n\r\n  “When Coleridge quitted the University and came to town, full of\r\n  mantling hopes and glorious schemes, Lamb became his admiring\r\n  disciple. The scene of these happy meetings was a little public-house\r\n  called the _Salutation and Cat_, in the neighbourhood of Smithfield,\r\n  where they used to sup, and remain long after they had ‘heard the\r\n  chimes of midnight.’ There they discoursed of Bowles, who was the god\r\n  of Coleridge’s poetical idolatry, and of Burns and Cowper, who of\r\n  recent poets--in that season of comparative barrenness--had made the\r\n  deepest impression on Lamb; there Coleridge talked of ‘fate,\r\n  free-will, foreknowledge absolute,’ to one who desired ‘to find no\r\n  end’ of the golden maze; and there he recited his early poems with\r\n  that deep sweetness of intonation which sunk into the heart of his\r\n  hearers. To these meetings Lamb was accustomed, at all periods of his\r\n  life, to revert, as the season when his finer intellects were\r\n  quickened into action. Shortly after they had terminated, with\r\n  Coleridge’s departure from London, he thus recalled them in a\r\n  letter:--‘When I read in your little volume your nineteenth effusion,\r\n  or what you call “The Sigh,” I think I hear _you_ again. I imagine to\r\n  myself the little smoky room at the _Salutation and Cat_, where we\r\n  have sat together through the winter nights, beguiling the cares of\r\n  life with poesy.’ This was early in 1769, and in 1818, when dedicating\r\n  his works--then first collected--to his earliest friend, he thus spoke\r\n  of the same meetings:--’Some of the sonnets, which shall be carelessly\r\n  turned over by the general reader, may happily awaken in you\r\n  remembrances which I should be sorry should be ever totally\r\n  extinct--the memory “of summer days and of delightful years,” even so\r\n  far back as those old suppers at our old inn--when life was fresh and\r\n  topics exhaustless--and you first kindled in me, if not the power, yet\r\n  the love of poetry, and beauty, and kindliness.’”\r\n\r\nThe ANGEL was derived from the Salutation, for that it originally\r\nrepresented the angel appearing to the Holy Virgin at the Salutation or\r\nAnnunciation, is evident from the fact that, even as late as the\r\nseventeenth century on nearly all the trades tokens of houses with this\r\nsign, the Angel is represented with a scroll in his hands; and this\r\nscroll we know, from the evidence of paintings and prints, to contain\r\nthe words addressed by the angel to the Holy Virgin: “Ave Maria, gratia\r\nplena, Dominus tecum.” Probably at the Reformation it was considered too\r\nCatholic a sign, and so the Holy Virgin was left out, and the angel only\r\nretained. Among the famous houses with this sign, the well-known\r\nstarting-place of the Islington omnibuses stands foremost. It is said to\r\nhave been an established inn upwards of two hundred years. The old house\r\nwas pulled down in 1819; till that time it had preserved all the\r\nfeatures of a large country inn, a long front, overhanging tiled roof,\r\nwith a square inn-yard having double galleries supported by columns and\r\ncarved pilasters, with caryatides and other ornaments. It is more than\r\nprobable that it had often been used as a place for dramatic\r\nentertainments at the period when inn-yards were customarily employed\r\nfor such purposes. “Even so late as fifty years since it was customary\r\nfor travellers approaching London, to remain all night at the Angel Inn,\r\nIslington, rather than venture after dark to prosecute their journey\r\nalong ways which were almost equally dangerous from their bad state, and\r\ntheir being so greatly infested with thieves.”[388] On the other hand,\r\npersons walking from the city to Islington in the evening, waited near\r\nthe end of John Street, in what is now termed Northampton Street, (but\r\nwas then a rural avenue planted with trees,) until a sufficient party\r\nhad collected, who were then escorted by an armed patrol appointed for\r\nthat purpose. Another old tavern with this sign is extant in London,\r\nbehind St Clement’s Church in the Strand. To this house Bishop Hooper\r\nwas taken by the Guards, on his way to Gloucester, where he went to be\r\nburnt, in January 1555. The house, until lately, preserved much of its\r\nancient aspect: it had a pointed gable, galleries, and a lattice in the\r\npassage. This inn is named in the following curious advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “To be sold, a Black Girl, the property of J. B----, eleven years of\r\n  age, who is extremely handy, works at her needle tolerably, and speaks\r\n  French perfectly well; is of excellent temper and willing disposition.\r\n  Inquire of W. Owen, at the _Angel Inn_, behind St Clement’s Church, in\r\n  the Strand.”--_Publick Advertiser_, March 28, 1769.\r\n\r\nOlder than either of these is the Angel Inn, at Grantham. This building\r\nwas formerly in the possession of the Knights Templars, and still\r\nretains many remains of its former beauty, particularly the gateway,\r\nwith the heads of Edward III. and his queen Philippa of Hainault on\r\neither side of the arch; the soffits of the windows are elegantly\r\ngroined, and the parapet of the front is very beautiful. Kings have been\r\nentertained in this house; but it seemed to bring ill luck to them, for\r\nthe reigns of those that are recorded as having been guests in it, stand\r\nforth in history as disturbed by violent storms--King John held his\r\ncourt in it on February 23, 1213; King Richard III. on October 19, 1483;\r\nand King Charles I. visited it May 17, 1633.\r\n\r\nBen Jonson, it is said, used to visit a tavern with the sign of the\r\nAngel, at Basingstoke, kept by a Mrs Hope, whose daughter’s name was\r\nPrudence. On one of his journeys, finding that the house had changed\r\nboth sign and mistresses, Ben wrote the following smart but not very\r\nelegant epigram:--\r\n\r\n  “When _Hope_ and _Prudence_ kept this house, the _Angel_ kept the\r\n  door,\r\n  Now _Hope_ is dead, the _Angel_ fled, and _Prudence_ turned a w----.”\r\n\r\nThe Angel was the sign of one of the first coffee-houses in England, for\r\nAnthony Wood tells us that, “in 1650 Jacob, a Jew, opened a coffee-house\r\nat the Angel, in the parish of St Peter, Oxon; and there it [coffee] was\r\nby some, who delight in noveltie, drank.” Finally, there was an Angel\r\nTavern in Smithfield, where the famous Joe Miller, of joking fame--a\r\ncomic actor by profession--used to play during Bartholomew Fair time. A\r\nplaybill of 1722 informs the public in large letters that--\r\n\r\n  “MILLER is not with PINKETHMAN, but by himself, AT THE ANGEL TAVERN,\r\n  next door to the King’s Bench, who acts a new Droll, called the\r\n  FAITHFUL COUPLE OR THE ROYAL SHEPHERDESS, with a very pleasant\r\n  entertainment between OLD HOB and his WIFE, and the comical humours of\r\n  MOPSY and COLLIN, with a variety of singing and dancing.\r\n\r\n  “The only Comedian now that dare,\r\n  Vie with the world and challenge the Fair.”\r\n\r\nIn France, also, the sign of the Angel is and was at all times, very\r\ncommon. The Hotel de _l’Ange_, Rue de la Huchette, appears to have been\r\nthe best hotel in Paris in the sixteenth century. It was frequently\r\nvisited by foreign ambassadors: those sent by Emperor Maximilian to\r\nLouis XII. took up their abode here; so did the ambassadors from Angus,\r\nKing of Achaia, who, in 1552, came to see France, much in the same way\r\nas various ambassadors from all sorts of high and low latitudes\r\noccasionally honour our Court with a visit. Chapelle, a French poet of\r\nthe seventeenth century, thus celebrates a tavern with this sign in\r\nParis, frequented by the wits of the period:--\r\n\r\n  “Je n’ay pas vu vostre theâtre\r\n    Qu’aussitot je ressors de là,\r\n  Pour un Ange que j’idolâtre,\r\n    A cause du bon vin qu’il a.”[389]\r\n\r\nThere being, then, such a profusion of Angels everywhere, it became\r\nnecessary to make some distinctions, and the usual means were adopted;\r\nthe Angel was gilded, and called the GOLDEN ANGEL; this, for instance,\r\nwas the sign of Ellis Gamble, a goldsmith in Cranbourn Alley, Hogarth’s\r\nmaster in the art of engraving on silver; shop-bills engraved for this\r\nhouse by Hogarth are still in existence. Another variety was the\r\nGUARDIAN ANGEL, which is still the sign of an ale-house at Yarmouth.\r\nThis, too, was used in France, as we find _l’Ange Gardien_, the sign of\r\nPierre Witte, a bookseller in the Rue St Jacques, Paris, in the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nVery common, also, were the THREE ANGELS, which may have been intended\r\nfor the three angels that appeared to Abraham, or simply the favourite\r\ncombination of three,[390] so frequent on the signboard and in\r\nheraldry. That three angels were thought to possess mysterious power, is\r\nevident from the following Devonshire charm for a burn:--\r\n\r\n  “Three Angels came from the north, east, and west,\r\n  One brought fire, another ice,\r\n  And the third brought the Holy Ghost,\r\n  So out fire--and in frost--\r\n  In the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.”\r\n\r\nThe THREE ANGELS was a very general linen-draper’s sign, for which there\r\nseems no reason other than that the long flowing garments in which they\r\nare generally represented, suggest their having been good customers to\r\nthe drapery business.\r\n\r\nAngels appear in combination with various heterogenous objects, in many\r\nof which, however, the so-called Angel is simply a Cupid. The ANGEL AND\r\nBIBLE was a sign in the Poultry in 1680.[391] The ANGEL AND CROWN was a\r\nnot uncommon tavern decoration. The following stanza from a pamphlet,\r\nentitled, “The Quack Vintners,” London, 1712, p. 18, shows the way in\r\nwhich this sign was represented:--\r\n\r\n  “May Harry’s ANGEL be a sign he draws\r\n  Angelick nectar, that deserves applause,\r\n  Such that may make the city love the Throne,\r\n  And, like his _Angel_, still _support the Crown_.”\r\n\r\nFrom this we learn it was a Cupid or Amorino supporting a crown; the\r\nsign of the house had doubtless originally been the Crown, and the\r\nCupid, so common in the Renaissance style, had been added by way of\r\nornament, but was mistaken by the public as a constituent of the sign.\r\nThe verses probably applied to the Angel and Crown, a famous tavern in\r\nBroad Street, behind the Royal Exchange. There was another ANGEL AND\r\nCROWN in Islington, where convivial dinners were held in the olden time.\r\nIt was a common practice in the last and preceding centuries for the\r\nnatives of a county or parish to meet once a year and dine together. The\r\nceremony often commenced by a sermon, preached by a native, after which\r\nthe day was spent in pleasant conviviality, after-dinner speeches, and\r\nmutual congratulations. The custom now has almost died out; but this is\r\none of the invitation tickets:\r\n\r\n  ST MARY, ISLINGTON.\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n  You are desidered to meet many other NATIVES of this place on Tuesday\r\n  y^{e} 11th day of April 1738 at Mrs Eliz. Grimstead’s y^{e} ANGEL AND\r\n  CROWN, in y^{e} Upper Street, about y^{e} hour of One; Then and there\r\n  w^{th} FULL DISHES, GOOD WINE AND GOOD HUMOUR to improve and make\r\n  lasting that HARMONY and FRIENDSHIP which have so long reigned among\r\n  us.\r\n\r\n  _Walter Sebbon._\r\n  _John Booth._\r\n  _Bourchier Durrell._\r\n  _James Sebbon._\r\n\r\n  STEWARDS.\r\n\r\n  N.B. THE DINNER will be on the table peremptorily at Two.\r\n\r\n  _Pray pay the Bearer Five Shillings._\r\n\r\nThat same year, another Angel and Crown Tavern in Shire Lane obtained an\r\nunenviable notoriety, for it was there that a Mr Quarrington was\r\nmurdered and robbed by Thomas Carr, an attorney from the Temple, and\r\nElisabeth Adams. They were hanged at Tyburn, January 18, 1738.\r\n\r\nThe ANGEL AND GLOVES at first sight seems a whimsical combination, but\r\nis easily explained when we advert to the woodcut above the shop-bill of\r\nIsaac Dalvy, in Little Newport Street, Soho, who, in the reign of Queen\r\nAnne, sold gloves, &c., under this sign, which simply represented two\r\nCupids, each carrying a glove,--in fact, exactly the same conceit as\r\nthat of the Herculanese shoemaker, noticed in a former chapter. It is\r\nmore difficult to find a rational explanation for the ANGEL AND\r\nSTILLIARDS. The Steelyard, or Stilliard, in Upper Thames Street, was the\r\nplace where the Hanse merchants exposed their goods for sale, and was so\r\ncalled from the king’s _steelyard_, or _beam_, there erected for\r\nweighing the tonnage of goods imported into London.[392] Whether this\r\nsign represented a Cupid with such a weighing machine, or a view of the\r\nhall of the Hanse merchants, with a Fame flying over it, is now\r\nimpossible to decide. It may be suggested that a variation of the\r\nwell-known figure of Justice, with steelyards in place of the usual\r\nscales, was the origin. Be this as it may, the only mention we have\r\nfound of the sign is in the following advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “William Deval, at the ANGEL & STILLIARDS, in St Ann’s Lane, near\r\n  Aldersgate, London, maketh Castle (Castille), Marble, and white Sope\r\n  as good as any Marseilles Sope; Tryed and Proved and sold at very\r\n  Reasonable Rates.”[393]--_Domestic Intelligencer_, January 2d, 1679.\r\n\r\nA few years later we find the ANGEL AND STILL noticed, as in the\r\nfollowing advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “A well-set NEGRO, commonly called Sugar, aged about twenty years,\r\n  teeth broke before, and several scars in both his cheeks and forehead,\r\n  having absented from his Master, whosoever secures him and gives\r\n  notice to Benjamin Maynard, at the ANGEL AND STILL, at Deptford, shall\r\n  have a Guinea Reward and reasonable charges.”--_Weekly Journal_,\r\n  October 18, 1718.\r\n\r\nIn this case the still was simply added to intimate the sale of\r\nspirituous liquors.\r\n\r\nThe ANGEL AND SUN, apparently a combination of two signs, is named as a\r\nshop or tavern near Strandbridge, in 1663,[394] and is still the name of\r\na public-house in the Strand. The ANGEL AND WOOLPACK, at Bolton, is the\r\nsame sign which, near London Bridge, is called the NAKED BOY AND\r\nWOOLPACK. A woolpack, with a negro seated on it, was at one time very\r\ncommon; for a change or distinction, this negro underwent the reputed\r\nimpossible process of being washed white, and thus became a naked boy,\r\nwhich, in signboard phraseology, is equivalent to an angel.\r\n\r\nThe VIRGIN was unquestionably a very common sign before the Reformation,\r\nand it may be met with even at the present day, as, for instance, at\r\nEbury Hill, Worcester, and in various other places. In France it was,\r\nand is still, much more common than in England, as might be expected.\r\nTallemant des Réaux tells of a miraculous tavern sign of NOTRE DAME, on\r\nthe bridge of that name, in Paris, which was observed by the faithful to\r\ncry and shed tears, probably on account of the bad company she had to\r\nharbour. It was taken down by order of the archbishop. At the end of the\r\nseventeenth century there was, in the Rue de la Seine, Paris, a quack\r\ndoctor, who pretended to cure a great variety of complaints. He put up a\r\nholy Virgin for his sign, with the words, “REFUGIUM PECCATORUM,” which\r\nis one of the usual epithets of the holy Virgin in the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch service, very wittily, although profanely, applied in this\r\ninstance. The sign of the Virgin was also called OUR LADY, as: “Newe\r\nInne was a guest Inne, the sign whereof was the picture of our Lady, and\r\nthereupon it was also called _Our Lady’s_ Inne.”[395] OUR LADY OF PITY\r\nwas the sign of Johan Redman, a bookseller in Paternoster Row, in 1542.\r\nJohan Byddell, also a bookseller, had introduced this sign in the\r\nbeginning of that century. This Byddell, or Bedel, (who lived in Fleet\r\nStreet, next to Fleet Bridge,) had evidently borrowed it from a nearly\r\nsimilar figure in Corio’s History of Milan, 1505. He afterwards lived at\r\nthe SUN, in Fleet Street, the house formerly occupied by Wynkyn de\r\nWorde.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of the BAPTIST’S HEAD probably dated from the time when\r\npilgrimages across the sea were considered good works, and the head of\r\nSt John the Baptist at Amiens Cathedral came in for a large share of\r\nvisits from English worshippers. The old monkish writers say that in 448\r\nafter Christ, the head was found in Jerusalem; in 1206 it was\r\ntransferred to Amiens, where it was kept in a salver of gold, surrounded\r\nwith a rim of pearls and precious stones.[396] Various other reasons may\r\nbe adduced for the prevalence of this sign, as the conspicuous place\r\noccupied by St John in the Roman Catholic hagiology, and hence in\r\nmediæval plays and mysteries; the festivities of Midsummer, (a day of\r\ngreat moment in London for setting the watch;) and, finally, his being\r\nthe patron saint of the Knights of Jerusalem. It was doubtless in\r\ncompliment to those knights that the Baptist’s Head in St John’s Lane,\r\nClerkenwell, was named. This house seems to be the remainder of some\r\nnoble mansion of Queen Elizabeth’s time; it contains many Elizabethan\r\nornaments, particularly a chimney-piece, with the coats of arms of the\r\nRadcliff and Forster families. When the house was adapted to its present\r\npurpose, it was distinguished by the head of St John the Baptist in a\r\ncharger, now gone. Doctor Johnson is said to have been an occasional\r\nvisitor here, when returning from Edward Cave’s, the editor of the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_, whose office was close by at St John’s Gate.\r\nGoldsmith is also reported to have made frequent calls here, when\r\nbusiness of a similar nature led him to the same spot. In later years it\r\nbecame the _house of call_ of the prisoners on their way to the new\r\nprison in the parish--a circumstance commemorated by Dodd in the “Old\r\nBailey Registers.” Another St John’s Head is mentioned by Stow in the\r\nfollowing accident:--\r\n\r\n  “The 11th of July (1553) Gilbert Pot, drawer to Ninion Saunders,\r\n  vintner, dwelling at St John’s Head within Ludgate, who was accused by\r\n  the said Saunders, his maister, was set on the pillory in Cheape, with\r\n  both his ears nailed and cleane cut off, for wordes speaking at the\r\n  time of the proclamation of Lady Jane; at which execution was a\r\n  trumpet bloune and a herault in his coat of armes redd his offence, in\r\n  presence of William Garrard, one of the Sheriffes of London. About 5\r\n  of the clocke the same day, in the afternoone, Ninion Saunders, master\r\n  to the said Gilbert Pot, and John Owen, a gunmaker, both gunners of\r\n  the Tower, comming from the Tower of London by water in a whirrie and\r\n  shooting London Bridge, towards the Black Fryers, were drowned at S.\r\n  Mary Loch[397] and the whirry-man saved by their oars.”\r\n\r\nTo this same saint also refers the JOHN OF JERUSALEM, a sign at the\r\npresent day in Rosoman Street, Clerkenwell, put up, like the Baptist\r\nHead, in remembrance of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem, who\r\nformerly had their priory in this locality.\r\n\r\nIn France this sign was equally common. Jean Carcain, one of the early\r\nParisian publishers and printers, (1487,) adopted it for his shop. One\r\nof his books has the following quaint impress:--\r\n\r\n  “Parisii Sancti Pons est Michaelis in Urbe;\r\n    Multae illic aedes; notior una tamen;\r\n  Hanc cano, quae _Sacri Baptistae fronte_ notata est\r\n    Hic respondebit Bibliopola tibi;\r\n  Vis impressoris nomen quoque nosse? Joannis\r\n    Carcain nomen ei est. Ne pete plura, Vale.”[398]\r\n\r\nIt was an old signboard jocularity in France to represent St John the\r\nBaptist by a monkey with cambric (_batiste_) ruffles and wristbands,\r\n(_singe en batiste_.) From the parables the sign of the GOOD SAMARITAN\r\nwas borrowed, which, even at the present day, may be seen in Turner\r\nStreet, Whitechapel; Grimshaw Park, Blackburn, &c. When barbers combined\r\nwith their trade the practice of letting blood--otherwise than by “easy\r\nshaving,”--of drawing teeth, and setting bones, they frequently adopted\r\nthis sign. In the seventeenth century, a barber-surgeon at Leeuwarden,\r\nin Holland, wrote under his device of the Good Samaritan the following\r\npoetical effusion:--\r\n\r\n  “Gelyk den Wyn, fyn,\r\n  Dryft zorgen uit der herten\r\n  Zoo geneest Medicyn, pyn,\r\n  En ontlast van Smarten.”[399]\r\n\r\nThe SAMARITAN WOMAN (_la Samaritaine_) is the French version of our\r\nJACOB’S WELL, and was a common sign in Paris; everybody knows the Bains\r\nde la Samaritaine, in which the luxurious Parisian indulges in a _fresh_\r\nwater bath in his Seine, which at that place is about as clear as the\r\nThames at Blackwall. In the Rue Caquerel at Rouen there is a stone\r\nbas-relief of the Samaritan woman at the well, with the date 1580.\r\nJacques Dupuy, a bookseller in the Rue St Jacques, also used the\r\nSamaritan woman as his sign, evidently because it was a subject in which\r\nhe could introduce a well, and so have the satisfaction of punning on\r\nhis name. This kind of pun was none the less relished for being\r\nfar-fetched; thus there is a stone bas-relief in the Rue Froid, at Caen,\r\nof the MIRACULOUS DRAUGHT OF FISHES, (_la Pêche Miraculeuse_,) which, in\r\nthe early part of the seventeenth century, was placed there by a\r\nbookseller of the name of Poisson, (Fish,) who, being an “odd fish,”\r\nadopted this sign as a pun on his own name. At the present day, the\r\nhouse is still inhabited by a bookseller of the same name and family.\r\n\r\nChrist’s Passion does not seem to have suggested any signs in England,\r\nalthough the great symbol of His death, the CROSS, was comparatively\r\ncommon. In Paris there was, in 1640, a bookseller, George Josse, in the\r\nRue St Jacques, who had the CROWN OF THORNS (_la Couronne d’Epine_) for\r\nhis sign, probably on account of the original Crown of Thorns being one\r\nof the relics kept at Paris. Coryatt’s remarks on this relic are rather\r\namusing:--\r\n\r\n  “They report in Paris that the Thorny Crown, wherewith Christ was\r\n  crowned on the Crosse, is kept in the Palace, which vpon Corpus\r\n  Christi Day, in the afternoone, was publickly shewed, as some told me;\r\n  but it was not my chance to see it. Truely, I wonder to see the\r\n  contrarieties amongst the Papists, and most ridiculous varieties\r\n  concerning their reliques, but especially about this of Christ’s\r\n  Thorny Crowne. For whereas I was after that at the Citie of Vicenza in\r\n  Italy, it was told me that in the monastery of the Dominican Fryers of\r\n  that Citie, this Crowne was kept, which Saint Lewes, King of France,\r\n  bestowed upon his brother Bartholomew, Bishop of Vicenza, and before\r\n  one of the Dominican family. Wherefore I went to the Dominican\r\n  Monastery and made suit to see it, but I had the repulse; for they\r\n  told me that it was kept vnder three or four lockes, and neuer shewed\r\n  to any by any favour whatsoeuer, but only upon Corpus Christi Day. If\r\n  this Crowne of Paris, whereof they so much bragge, be true, that of\r\n  Vicenza is false. Ho! the truth and certainty of Papistical\r\n  reliques.”[400]\r\n\r\nCROSSES of various colours were probably amongst the first signs put up\r\nby the newly-converted Christians, (as soon as they could effect this\r\nwith impunity,) on account of the recommendation of the early fathers,\r\nand for their beneficial influence. Father Lactantius, who lived in the\r\nfourth century, writes--“As Christ, whilst He lived amongst men, put the\r\ndevils to flight by His words, and restored those to their senses whom\r\nthese evil spirits had possessed; so now His followers in the name of\r\ntheir Master, and by the sign of His passion, even exercise the same\r\ndominion over them.” St Ephrem says--“_Let us paint and imprint on our\r\ndoors_ the life-giving cross; thus defended no evil will hurt you.” St\r\nChrysostom says the same--“_Wherefore let us with earnestness impress\r\nthis cross on our houses, and on our walls, and our windows._” St Cyril\r\nof Alexandria introduces the Emperor Julian the apostate saying, “You\r\nChristians adore the wood of the cross, _you engrave it on the porches\r\nof your houses_,” &c. Hence the still prevalent custom in Roman Catholic\r\nplaces of painting crosses on the walls of houses, to drive away\r\nwitches, as it is said; and these crosses being painted in different\r\ncolours, might easily serve as a sign by which to designate the house.\r\nAt the Crusades the popularity of this emblem increased: a red cross was\r\nthe badge of the Crusader, and would be put up as a sign by men who had\r\nbeen to the Holy Land, or wished to court the patronage of those on\r\ntheir way thither. Finally, the different orders of knighthood settled\r\neach upon a particular colour as their distinctive mark. Thus the\r\nknights of St John wore _white crosses_, the Templars _red crosses_, the\r\nknights of St Lazarus _green crosses_, the Teutonic knights _black\r\ncrosses_, embroidered with gold, &c. But the most common in England was\r\nthe _red cross_, which was the cross of St George, and also of the red\r\ncross knights, who acted as a sort of police on the roads between Europe\r\nand the Holy Land to protect pilgrims. This badge, therefore, could not\r\nfail to be very popular.\r\n\r\nIn France it used to be, and in all probability is still, a common rebus\r\nto see _le signe de la croix_ represented by a swan with a cross on his\r\nback, (_cygne de la croix_.)\r\n\r\nOnly very few signs of the cross are now remaining. The GOLDEN CROSS in\r\nthe Strand is one of these, and has been in that locality for centuries.\r\nIt was one of the first upon which the Puritans brooked their ill-humour\r\nand hatred of popery; for in 1643 it was taken down by order of a\r\ncommittee from the House of Commons, as “superstitious and idolatrous.”\r\nThis was the precursor of the fall of old Charing Cross itself. The\r\nsign, however, was put up again at the Restoration, and figures\r\nprominently in Canaletti’s well-known view of Charing Cross, in the\r\nNorthumberland Collection. The tavern was probably pulled down at the\r\nformation of Trafalgar Square.\r\n\r\nAt a point on the road between Dunchurch and Daventry, where three roads\r\nmeet, there was formerly an inn with the sign of the THREE CROSSES, in\r\nallusion to the three roads. Swift, in one of his pedestrian excursions,\r\nhappened to stop at that inn. Not being very elegantly dressed, and\r\nrather importunate to be served, the landlady told him that she could\r\nnot leave her customers for “such as he,” upon which the Dean, who was\r\nnot the most modest, nor the most patient of men, wrote the following\r\nepigram on one of the windows:--\r\n\r\n            “TO THE LANDLORD.\r\n  There hang three crosses at thy door,\r\n  Hang up thy wife and she’ll make four.”\r\n\r\nThe RESURRECTION was the sign of John Day, a bookseller, who, in the\r\nreign of Queen Elizabeth, dwelt in St Sepulchre’s parish, a little above\r\nHolbourne Conduit. It was a sort of conundrum or charade on his name,\r\nwhich was carried out by his colophon, representing a man asleep, who is\r\nwakened by another with the words, “Arise, for it is _day_.” This,\r\nalthough somewhat profane, according to our present notions of such\r\nthings, was nothing strange in a time when the people, though\r\nProtestants by name, were still strongly imbued with Roman Catholic\r\nideas. John Cawoode, also a printer and publisher of St Paul’s\r\nChurchyard in 1558, had a still more profane sign--viz., the HOLY GHOST.\r\nAnd this even continued till the beginning of the seventeenth century,\r\nfor in 1602 we find this identical sign used by another printer, William\r\nLeake, who was probably his successor, and published in that year\r\nShakespeare’s “Venus and Adonis.” Worse still was the sign of another\r\nbookseller in St Paul’s Churchyard in 1520, which was the\r\n_Trinity_.[401] We must bear in mind, however, that in Roman Catholic\r\ncountries conversation upon matters of religion is not nearly so strict\r\nand guarded as amongst believers in Protestant nations. An amusing\r\ninstance of this once occurred to the writer in Jerusalem, the great\r\nhead-quarters of Christianity. Usually the pilgrims or travellers\r\nstaying at the Latin convent there, which serves as an hotel, dine all\r\ntogether in a kind of _table-d’hôte_ fashion; but for some reason it so\r\nfell out that our party one day dined in private. The holy brother who\r\nattended us happened to be a Spaniard, and as we had visited that\r\ncountry, and were tolerably acquainted with Valladolid, his native town,\r\nworldly recollections began to overcome the sanctity of the good monk,\r\nand he became inexhaustible in reminiscences of his younger days. Whilst\r\ntalking with him, and refreshing ourselves with a meal of salad, grown\r\nin the garden of Gethsemane, we had indulged in two tumblers of a pithy\r\nwhite wine, quite strong enough to justify our resisting the pressing\r\ninvitations of the reverend butler to take a third glass; but the jovial\r\nmonk was not to be beaten, and finally convinced us with the following\r\nargument: “Oh come, brother, you must take another glass, remember you\r\nare in Jerusalem, and so take one for the Father, one for the Son, and\r\none for the Holy Ghost!”\r\n\r\nAlthough the English ale and refreshment houses continue to select fresh\r\nsigns from the notabilities of the hour, the Palmerston’s Head and the\r\nGladstone Arms for instance, they rarely choose anything of a religious\r\nor devotional cast. One instance, however, occurs to us, and that in the\r\nneighbourhood of London, which deserves mention. In Kentish Town, under\r\nthe Hampstead hills, the noisiest and most objectionable public-house in\r\nthe district bears the significant sign of the GOSPEL OAK. It is the\r\nfavourite resort of navvies and quarrelsome shoemakers, and took its\r\nname, not from any inclination to piety on the part of the landlord, but\r\nfrom an old oak tree in the neighbourhood, near the boundary line of\r\nHampstead and St Pancras parishes, a relic of the once general custom of\r\nreading a portion of the gospel under certain trees in the parish\r\nperambulations, equivalent to “beating the bounds.” “The boundaries and\r\ntownship of the parish of Wolverhampton are,” says Shaw, in his “History\r\nof Staffordshire,” (vol. ii., p. 165,) “in many points marked out by\r\nwhat are called _Gospel Trees_;” and Herrick, in his “Hesperides,” (Ed.\r\n1859, p. 26,) says:--\r\n\r\n                  “Dearest, bury me\r\n  Under that _holy oak_, or _gospel tree_;\r\n  Where, though thou see’st not, thou may’st think upon\r\n  Me, when _thou yeerly go’st procession_.”\r\n\r\nThe old Kentish Town Gospel Oak was removed a short time since, but not\r\nuntil it had given a name to the surrounding fields, to a village, (Oak\r\nvillage,) and to a chapel, as well as to the public-house alluded to.\r\n\r\n[366] New Essays and Characters, by John Stephens the younger, of\r\nLincoln’s Inn, Gent.

The Assyrians had their\r\ntriads. In Ancient Egypt every town or district had its own triad, which\r\nit worshipped, and which was a union of certain attributes, the third\r\nmember proceeding from the other two. Sir Gardiner Wilkinson, in his\r\n“Ancient Egyptians,” vol. iv., ch. xii., p. 230, mentions a stone with\r\nthe words “one Bail, one Athor, one Akori, hail father of the world,\r\nhail triformous God.” Thoms, in his “Dissertation on Ancient Chinese\r\nVases,” says:--“The Chinese have a remarkable preference for the number\r\nthree; they say one produced two, two produced three, and three produced\r\nall things. There is something remarkable in this last phrase; perhaps\r\nit conveys an indistinct idea of the Trinity. The Buddhists, who are of\r\nmodern date in China, use the term ‘the three precious ones’--‘the Deity\r\nthat has ruled, the ruling Deity, and the Deity that shall rule.’ The\r\nTaore sect have also their ‘three pure ones.’ The number three has many\r\nassociations, as the three bonds--a prince and minister, father and son,\r\nhusband and wife; the three superintendents--the treasurer, judge, and\r\ncollector of customs; the three powers--heaven, earth, and man,” &c. In\r\nthe Hindoo religion combinations of three are equally frequent: they\r\nhave several trimustis or trinities; three principal deities, Brahma,\r\nVishnu, and Mahadeva; another triad is Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, or\r\nmatter, spirit, and destruction; there are three plaited locks on the\r\nhead of Radha, representing a mystical union of three principal rivers,\r\nGanges, Yamuna, and Sarawati. Siva has three eyes; the sun is called\r\nthree-bodied; the triangle with the Hindoos is a favourite type for the\r\ntriune co-equality, hence the pentagram (a figure composed of two\r\nequilateral triangles, placed with the apex of the one towards the base\r\nof the other, and so forming six triangles by the intersections of their\r\nsides) is in great favour with them; further, they use three mystic\r\nletters to denote their deity; have 3 × 7 hells, (seven is also a mystic\r\nnumber with them and other ancient races,) and many other combinations\r\nof three. The same preference for this number is observable in the Greek\r\nand Roman mythology, which mentions three theocraties, three graces,\r\nthree fates, three harpies, three syrens, three heads of Cerberus, three\r\neggs of Leda, &c. And, taking 3 as a unit, 3 × 3 muses, 3 × 4 principal\r\ngods, (Dii Majores,) 3 × 4 labours of Hercules, &c.\r\n\r\n[391] _London Gazette_, Nov 8 to 11, 1680.\r\n\r\n[392] Cunningham’s Handbook to London, p. 470.\r\n\r\n[393] Soap, wax, tallow, and similar articles were part of the\r\nmerchandise in which the Hanse merchants dealt.\r\n\r\n[394] _Kingdom’s Intelligencer_, April 6-13, 1663.\r\n\r\n[395] Stow’s Survey of London.\r\n\r\n[396] See a woodcut of an Amiens pilgrim’s token in the Journal of Brit.\r\nArch.

In France this was\r\nstill worse than in England. That amusing gossip, Tallemant des Réaux,\r\nin his “Contes et Historiettes,” tells us how an innkeeper of the Rue\r\nMontmartre, in Paris, put up for his sign the GOD’S HEAD, (_la Tête\r\nDieu_,) and notwithstanding all the efforts of the curé of St Eustache\r\nto make him take it down he would not comply until compelled by the\r\nmagistrates. Though two centuries have elapsed, the French of the\r\npresent day are not much better; for in Paris, in the Rue Mondétour,\r\nthere is actually a café known as the NOM DE JESUS.\r\n\r\nBoursault, a clever writer of the time of Louis XIV., whose indignant\r\nletter about the Royal Arms we have noticed in a former chapter,\r\naddressed a letter to Bizoton, one of the police magistrates, in which\r\nhe vents his anger at some of the religious signs, and complains of the\r\nprofanity of a lodging-house with the sign of the ANNUNCIATION in the\r\nRue de la Huchette, in which there were as many rogues and reprobates as\r\nthere were honest lodgers. Amongst the signs that shocked him most he\r\nnames _le Saint Esprit_, (the Holy Ghost,) _la Trinité_, (the Trinity,)\r\n_l’Image Notre Dame_, &c.; but particularly one, representing Christ\r\ntaken prisoner, with the profane motto, “_Au juste prix_.” This contains\r\na blasphemous pun,--_juste prix_ at once signifying a _fixed price_, and\r\n“just caught.” The sign was set up at a little ordinary in a lane\r\nbetween the Rue St Honoré and the Rue Richelieu. And, though Boursault\r\nsays in his letter that he had so fumed and thundered against the\r\nlandlord that he had taken it down, yet it made its appearance again\r\nafterwards, and was handed down to our time, since not many years ago it\r\nmight have been observed in the Cour du Dragon, above the shop of an\r\nironmonger.\r\n\r\nSaints are still in full feather on the signboards in Roman Catholic\r\ncountries. Amongst hundreds of others the following may be seen in Paris\r\non cafés and hotels in the present day:--St Barbe, St Christophe, St\r\nEustache, St Joseph, St Laurent, St Marie, St Louis, St Merri, St\r\nMichel, St Paul, St Phar, St Pierre, St Quentin, St Roc, St Thomas\r\nd’Aquin, St Vincent de Paul, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nA curious French sign is mentioned by Coryatt, which he saw at Amiens.\r\n“I lay at the signe of the AVE MARIA, where I read these two verses,\r\nwritten in golden letters upon the linterne of the doore, at the entry\r\ninto the Inne. This in Greeke, Της φιλοξενιας μη ἐπιλανϐανεσθε, that is,\r\nForget not your good entertainment; and this in Latine, HOSPITIBUS HIC\r\nTUTA FIDES.”[402]\r\n\r\nSaints were formerly very common on signboards, and this abuse also was\r\nwittily ridiculed by the pungent satire of Artus Desiré, a French poet\r\nof the fifteenth century:--\r\n\r\n  “En leur logis plein de vers et de teignes,\r\n  Où est logé le grand diable d’enfer,\r\n  Mettent de Dieu et de saints les enseignes,\r\n  Leurs ditz logis où n’y a que desroys.\r\n  Pendre font tous sur le pavé du roy\r\n  De grands tableaux et enseignes dorées,\r\n  Pour des montres qu’ils ont fort bien de quoy,\r\n  Et qu’il y a de tres grasses porées.\r\n  L’un pour enseigne aura _la Trinité_,\r\n  L’autre _Saint Jehan_, et l’autre _Saint Savin_,\r\n  L’autre _Saint Maure_, l’autre _l’Humanité_\r\n  De _Jesus Christ_ notre Sauveur divin,\r\n  De Dieu, des saintz, sont leurs crieurs de vin,[403]\r\n  Tant aux citez que villes et villages,\r\n  Des susditz sainctz les devotes images,\r\n  En prophanant leur préciosité.”[404]\r\n\r\nMany of these saints were patrons of particular trades, and were\r\nconstantly adopted as the signs of those that followed them. Thus ST\r\nCRISPIN was generally a shoemaker’s sign. At the present day, the gentle\r\ncraft represented by this saint live up to the proverb, and keep to the\r\n“last;” but many publicans still have the sign of CRISPIN, SAINT\r\nCRISPIN, JOLLY CRISPIN, or CRISPIN AND CRISPIAN, and occasionally KING\r\nCRISPIN, (as at Morpeth.) And well may they put their houses under the\r\nprotection of this saint, since the proverb says, “_Cobblers_ and\r\ntinkers are the best ale drinkers.” Crispin and Crispian were two Roman\r\nbrothers, sons of a king; they travelled to France to preach\r\nChristianity, and worked at the trade of shoemakers, making sandals for\r\nthe poor, which they gave away, the angels supplying them with leather.\r\nHence they are considered the patrons of shoemakers. They were beheaded\r\nat Soissons in 308. What may have contributed to their popularity in\r\nthis country is the fact of the battle of Agincourt having been fought\r\non their day, October 25, 1415:--\r\n\r\n  “And Crispin Crispian shall never go by\r\n  From this day to the ending of the world,\r\n  But we in it shall be remember’d,\r\n  We few, we happy few, we band of brothers,\r\n  For he to-day that sheds his blood with me\r\n  Shall be my brother; be he ne’er so vile,\r\n  This day shall gentle his condition,\r\n  And gentlemen in England now a-bed\r\n  Shall think themselves accurs’d they were not here,\r\n  And hold their manhoods cheap, while any speaks\r\n  That fought with us upon St Crispin’s day.”\r\n\r\n  _Henry the Fifth_, iv. 3.\r\n\r\nFrom Shakespeare we turn to the homely rhymes of a Dutch shoemaker at\r\nthe Hague, who, in the seventeenth century, had this couplet over his\r\ndoor:--\r\n\r\n  “Dit is Sint Crispyn, maar ik hiet Stoffel,\r\n  Ik maak een laars, schoen en pantoffel.”[405]\r\n\r\nA more spirited one about the same time was in Bergen op Zoom, which is\r\nnot bad satire for a Dutchman:--\r\n\r\n  “Hier in Krispyn kan men de mensch uit beestevellen\r\n  Elk schoenen na zyn voet voor gelt terstond bestellen,\r\n  Doch menig beest alheir steekt in een menschevel,\r\n  Draagt zelf zyn broeder’s huid en ’t staat dat beest nog wel.”[406]\r\n\r\nThe ST HUGH’S BONES was another sign of the gentle craft; it seems to be\r\nextinct now, but a trades token shows that, in 1657, it was the sign of\r\na house in Stanhope Street, Claremarket. From a little chapbook,\r\nentitled,--\r\n\r\n  “The Delightful, Princely, and Entertaining History of the Gentle\r\n  Craft, &c. London printed for J. Rhodes, at the corner of Bride Lane,\r\n  in Fleet Street, 1725,”\r\n\r\nwe gather that Saint Hugh was a prince’s son,[407] deeply in love with a\r\nsaintly coquette called Winifred. Having been jilted by this lady in a\r\nvery pious manner, he went travelling, resisted the temptations of\r\nVenice,[408] like another St Anthony, passed through numberless\r\nadventures, compared to which those of Baron Munchausen sink into\r\ninsignificance, and was finally, by a jumble of most amusing\r\nanachronism, martyred in the reign of Diocletian, by being made to drink\r\na cup of the blood of his lady-love, mixed with “cold poison,” after\r\nwhich, his body was hung on the gallows. But among other misfortunes in\r\nhis travels, he had been shipwrecked and lost all his wealth, so that he\r\nhad to choose a profession, which was that of shoemaker, and so well he\r\nliked his fellow-workmen that, having nothing else to give, he\r\nbequeathed his bones to them. After they had been “well picked by the\r\nbirds,” some shoemakers took them from the gallows, and made them into\r\ntools, and hence their tools were named St Hugh’s Bones. They are\r\nspecified in the following rhyme, which appears to have been the\r\nshoemakers’ shibboleth:--\r\n\r\n  “My friends, I pray, you listen to me,\r\n  And mark what Saint Hugh’s Bones shall be:\r\n  First a Drawer and a Dresser,\r\n  Two Wedges, a more and a lesser.\r\n  A pretty Block, Three Inches high,\r\n  In fashion squared like a die;\r\n  Which shall be called by proper name\r\n  A Heelblock, ah! the very same;\r\n  A Handleather and a Thumbleather likewise,\r\n  To put on Shooe-thread we must devise;\r\n  The Needle and the Thimble shall not be left alone,\r\n  The Pinchers, the Pricking Awl, and Rubbing Stone;\r\n  The Awl, Steel and Jacks, the Sowing Hairs beside,\r\n  The Stirrop holding fast, while we sow the Cow hide;\r\n  The Whetstone, the Stopping Stick, and the Paring Knife,\r\n  All this does belong to a Journeyman’s Life:\r\n  Our Apron is the shrine to wrap these Bones in,\r\n  Thus shroud we S. Hugh’s Bones in a gentle lamb’s skin.\r\n\r\n  “Now you good Yeomen of the Gentle Craft,” the story goes on, “tell me\r\n  (quoth he) how like you this? As well (replied they) as Saint George\r\n  does of his horse: for as long as we can see him fight the Dragon, we\r\n  will never part with this poesie. And it shall be concluded, That what\r\n  journeyman soever he be hereafter that cannot handle his Sword and\r\n  Buckler, his long Sword and Quarterstaff, sound the Trumpet, or play\r\n  upon the Flute, or bear his part in a Three Man’s song, and readily\r\n  reckon up his Tools in Rhime, (except he have borne colours in the\r\n  Field, being a Lieutenant, a Sergeant or Corporal,) shall forfeit and\r\n  pay a Bottle of Wine, or be counted a Colt; to which they answered all\r\n  _viva voce_, Content, Content. And then, after many merry songs, they\r\n  departed. And never after did they travel without these tools on their\r\n  backs, which ever since have been called Saint Hugh’s Bones.”\r\n\r\nBISHOP BLAZE, or Blaize, otherwise St Blasius, is another patron of a\r\ntrade to be met with on the signboard. This worthy, Bishop of Sebaste,\r\nin Cappadocia, is considered the patron of woolcombers, whence the sign\r\nis very common in the clothing districts. He is represented with the\r\ninstrument of his martyrdom in his hands, an iron comb, with which the\r\nflesh was torn from his body in 289; from this implement has been\r\nattributed to him the invention of woolcombing. His holiday is\r\ncelebrated every seventh year by a procession and feast of the masters\r\nand workmen of the woollen manufactories in Yorkshire and Bedfordshire;\r\nin sheep-shearing festivals, also, a representation of him used to be\r\nintroduced; a stripling in habiliments of wool was seated on a\r\nmilk-white steed, with a lamb in his lap, the horse, the youthful\r\nbishop, and the lamb all covered with a profusion of ribbons and\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nST JULIAN, the patron of travellers, wandering minstrels, boatmen, &c.,\r\nwas a very common inn sign, because he was supposed to provide good\r\nlodgings for such persons. Hence two Saint Julian’s crosses, in saltier,\r\nare in chief of the innholders’ arms, and the old motto was:--“When I\r\nwas harbourless ye lodged me.” This benevolent attention to travellers\r\nprocured him the epithet of “the good herbergeor,” and in France “_bon\r\nherbet_.” His legend in a MS., Bodleian, 1596, fol. 4, alludes to\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\n  “Therfore yet to this day, thei that over lond wende,\r\n  They biddeth Seint Julian, anon, that gode herborw he hem sende,\r\n  And Seint Julianes Pater Noster ofte seggeth also\r\n  For his faders soule and his moderes that he hem bring therto.”\r\n\r\nAnd in “Le dit des Heureux,” an old French fabliau:--\r\n\r\n  “Tu as dit la patenotre\r\n  Saint Julian à cest matin,\r\n  Soit en Roumans, soit en Latin,\r\n  Or tu seras bien ostilé.”[409]\r\n\r\nIn mediæval French, _L’hotel Saint Julien_ was synonymous with good\r\ncheer.\r\n\r\n          “Sommes tuit vostre.\r\n  Par Saint Pierre le bon Apostre,\r\n  L’ostel aurez Saint Julien,”[410]\r\n\r\nsays Mabile to her feigned uncle, in the fabliau of “Boivin de Provins;”\r\nand a similar idea appears in “Cocke Lorell’s bote,” where the crew,\r\nafter the entertainment with the “relygyous women” from the Stews’ Bank,\r\nat Colman’s Hatch,\r\n\r\n  “Blessyd theyr shyppe when they had done\r\n  And dranke about a _Saint Julyan’s torne_.”\r\n\r\nST MARTIN’S character as a saint was not unlike St Julian’s; hence we\r\nfind him frequently on the signboard. The most favourite representation\r\nbeing the saint on horseback cutting off with his sword a piece of his\r\ncloak, in order to clothe a naked beggar. Not only inns, but booksellers\r\nalso used his sign, as for instance Dionis Rose, (1514,) printer in the\r\nRue St Jacques, Paris; and Bernard Aubrey, another printer in the same\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n“Avoir l’hotel St Martin,” in old French, meant exactly the same as\r\n“avoir l’hotel St Julian:” thus, in the romance of Florus and Blanche:--\r\n\r\n  “_Flor._ Sovent dient par le bon vin\r\n           Qu’ils ont l’ostel Saint Martin.”[411]\r\n\r\nAnd in the story of “L’Anneau,” by Jean de Boves, (which is the same as\r\nChaucer’s “Miller’s Tale,”) it is said of the two students at the\r\nend:--“C’est ainsi qu’ils eûrent à ses depens l’ostel Saint\r\nMartin.”[412] These two saints, it is believed, are no longer to be\r\nfound on the signboard, but another powerful patron of travellers, ST\r\nCHRISTOPHER, may still occasionally be met with, as for instance in\r\nBath, where in the seventeenth century it was still very common. Taylor\r\nthe Water poet mentions it as the sign of an inn at Eton, and it occurs\r\non various trades tokens of London shops, inns, and taverns. This\r\nsaint’s intercession was thought efficacious against all danger from\r\nfire, flood, and earthquake, whence it became a custom to paint his\r\nimage of a colossal size on walls of churches and houses, sometimes\r\noccupying the whole height of the building, so that it might be seen\r\nfrom a great distance. Generally he was represented wading through a\r\nriver, with the infant Christ on his shoulders, and leaning on a\r\nflowering rod. Such representations are met with in every part of\r\nWestern Europe; they still remain in many places in England, as at St\r\nJames’ Church, South Elmham, Suffolk; Bibury Church, Gloucestershire;\r\nBeddington, Surrey; Croydon; Hengrave; West Wickham, &c., &c., &c. They\r\nwere also very numerous on the Continent; in the porch of St Mark’s,\r\nVenice, there is a mosaic bust of him, with these words:--\r\n\r\n  “Christophori Sancti speciem quicumque tuetur\r\n  Illo namque die nullo languore tenetur.”[413]\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar inscription occurs under one of the very earliest\r\nblock prints, (now in the possession of Earl Spencer,) evidently made\r\nfor pasting against the walls in inns, and other places frequented by\r\ntravellers and pilgrims. Under it are the following words:--\r\n\r\n  “Cristofori faciem die quacumque tueris\r\n  Illo nempe die morte malâ non morieris.\r\n                        millesimo ccccxx. tercio.”[414]\r\n\r\nTravellers even carried his figure about with them, either on their hat\r\nor on their breast, as we gather from Chaucer’s “Yeoman”--\r\n\r\n  “A Cristofre on his brest of silver shene.”\r\n\r\nIn the “Pleasant Conceits of Old Hobson the Londoner,” 1607, a jest is\r\nrelated, made by that dry old joker at the expense of Saint Christopher,\r\nwhich again illustrates the levity with which religious matters were\r\ntreated in those days:--\r\n\r\n  “Maister Hobson and another of his neighboris on a time walking to\r\n  Southwarke faire, by chance dranke in a house, which had the signe of\r\n  Sa. Christopher, of the which signe the goodman of the house gave this\r\n  commendation, Saint Christopher (quoth he) when hee lived upon the\r\n  earth bore the greatest burden that ever was, which was this, he bore\r\n  Christ over a river; nay, there was one (quoth Maister Hobson) that\r\n  bore a greater burden. Who was that? (quoth the innkeeper) Marry,\r\n  (quoth Maister Hobson) the asse that bore him and his mother. So was\r\n  the innekeeper called asse by craft.”\r\n\r\nThe house in which this joke was perpetrated is enumerated by Stowe\r\namongst the principal inns of Southwark.\r\n\r\nST LUKE still figures as the sign of two or three public-houses in\r\nLondon. Being the patron of painters, it certainly was the least the\r\nsign-painters could do to honour his portrait with an occasional\r\nappearance on the signboard. Yet it must be confessed St Luke was but a\r\nsorry hand at painting. There is a portrait of the Holy Virgin painted\r\nby him preserved in the Church of Silivria, on the shores of the Sea of\r\nMarmora; but such a daub! the most modest village sign-painter would be\r\nashamed of the production. Yet, for all that, the thing works miracles,\r\nand the only wonder is that its first effort in this line was not to\r\nchange itself into a good picture. We wonder at the Virgin, too, and\r\nexpected better from her taste; for in Valencia Cathedral there is\r\nanother portrait of her painted by Alonzo Cano, which is one of the most\r\nlovely female heads we ever had the happiness to gaze upon. And so well\r\npleased was the Holy Virgin with this likeness, that she deigned to\r\ndescend from heaven to compliment the blessed artist upon his work. So\r\nsays the legend, and so the old beadle tells the travellers. But Luke\r\npossessed other attributes. Aubrey tells us: “At Stoke Verdon, in the\r\nParish of Broad Chalke, was a chapell (in the chapell close by the\r\nfarm-house) dedicated to Saint Luke, _who is the Patron_ or Tutelar\r\n_Saint of the Horne Beasts, and those that have to do with them_,”\r\n&c.[415] This arose evidently from the Ox being his emblem, as the Lion\r\nwas of St Mark, the Eagle of St John, and the Angel of St Matthew. For\r\nthis reason St Luke was doubtless often chosen as the sign of inns\r\nfrequented by farmers and graziers.\r\n\r\nSIMON THE TANNER OF JOPPA is an old-established house in Long-lane,\r\nBermondsey, and, as a sign, is supposed to be unique. It seems to have\r\nbeen adopted with reference to the tanners, who frequented the house, or\r\nit may have been the former occupation of the landlord, who gave the\r\nsign to his house. Simon is named in Acts x. 32, “Send therefore to\r\nJoppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in\r\nthe house of one Simon a tanner, by the sea-side.”\r\n\r\nBut of all the signs coming under this class, SAINT GEORGE AND THE\r\nDRAGON is undoubtedly the greatest favourite in England, and it is\r\nequally well represented in other countries; for of this saint may be\r\nsaid what Velleius Paterculus said about Pompey: “Quot partes terrarum\r\nsunt, tot fecit monumenta victoriæ suæ.” In London alone there are at\r\npresent not less than sixty-six public-houses and taverns with this\r\nname, not counting the beer-houses, coffee-houses, &c. Yet, after all,\r\nit is very doubtful if St George ever existed, and he may be only a\r\npopular corruption of St Michael conquering Satan, or Perseus’ romantic\r\ndelivery of Andromeda. Hence the little rhyme recorded by Aubrey, and\r\nvarious other seventeenth century collectors of ana:\r\n\r\n  “To save a mayd St George the Dragon slew--\r\n  A pretty tale, if all is told be true.\r\n  Most say there are no dragons, and ’tis sayd\r\n  There was no George; pray God there was a mayd.”\r\n\r\nSt George is mentioned by Bede, who calls the 23d of April “Natale S.\r\nGeorgii Martyris.” He was, however, at that time a very recent\r\nimportation, for Adamnanus (690), who lived just before Bede, says,\r\nspeaking of Arnulphus after his return from the East: “Etiam nobis de\r\nquodam martyre Georgio nomine narrationem contulit.” In the reign of\r\nCanute, there was already a house of regular canons sacred to St George\r\nat Thetford, in Norfolk. The church of St George, Southwark, is also\r\nthought to have existed before the Conqueror. But after the Conquest,\r\nchapels were frequently erected to him, and on the seals of this period\r\nhe is often represented without the Dragon. Edward III. had a particular\r\nveneration for him. Many of his statutes begin: “Ad honorem omnipotentis\r\nDei, Sanctæ Mariæ Virginis gloriosæ, et Sancti Georgii Martyris.” It was\r\nafter the foundation of the Order of the Garter that it became such a\r\nfavourite sign. The fact that he was the patron of soldiers also\r\nassisted his popularity on the signboard.\r\n\r\nThere still exists an old and much dilapidated stone sign of St George\r\nand the Dragon in the front of a house on Snowhill. Frequently this sign\r\nis abbreviated to the GEORGE. There was an inn of this name, mentioned\r\nin 1554 as being situate on the north side of the TABARD. This inn was\r\nvery much damaged by the great fire of Southwark in 1670, and completely\r\nburned down in 1676. But it was rebuilt, and has come down to our time.\r\n\r\nMachyn, in his Diary, mentions several _Georges_; one of them in\r\nconnexion with an occurrence which gives a good view of these lawless\r\ntimes:--\r\n\r\n  “The viij day of December 1559 was the day of the Conception of owre\r\n  Lade was a grett fyre in the Gorge in Bred stret; itt begane at vj of\r\n  the cloke at nyght and dyd gret harm to dyvers houses. The 9th of\r\n  December cam serten fellows unto the Gorge in Bred stret where the\r\n  fyre was and gutt into the howse and brake up a chest of a clothear\r\n  and toke owt xl. lb. and after cryd _fyre_, _fyre_, so that ther cam\r\n  ijc pepull, and so they took one.”\r\n\r\nThe _George_ in Lombard Street was a very old house, once the town\r\nmansion of the Earl Ferrers, in which one of that family was murdered as\r\nearly as 1175, (see Stow.) At this house died, in 1524, Richard Earl of\r\nKent, who had wasted his property in gaming and extravagance; it was\r\nthen an inn, where the nobility used to put up at. George Dowdall,\r\nArchbishop of Armagh, (1558,) was buried from this house. Finally, we\r\nmay mention a _George Inn_ at Derby, in connexion with the following\r\nadvertisement from the _Daily Advertiser_, Oct. 1758:--\r\n\r\n  “A YOUNG LADY STRAYED.--A young Lady, just come out of Derbyshire,\r\n  strayed from her Guardian. She is remarkably genteel and handsome. She\r\n  has been brought up by a farmer near Derby, and knows no other but\r\n  that they are her parents; but it is not so, for she is a lady by\r\n  birth, though of but little learning. She has no cloathes with her,\r\n  but a riding habit she used to go to market in. She will have a fine\r\n  estate, as she is an heiress, but knows not her birth, as her parents\r\n  died when she was a child, and I had the care of her, so she knows not\r\n  but that I am her mother. She has a brown silk gown that she borrowed\r\n  of her maid--that is, dy’d silk, and her riding dress a light drab,\r\n  lin’d with blue Tammy, and it has blue loops at the button-holes; she\r\n  has outgrown it; and I am sure that she is in great distress both for\r\n  money and cloaths; but whoever has relieved her I will be answerable\r\n  if they will give me a letter, where she may be found; she knows not\r\n  her own sirname. I understand she has been in Northampton for some\r\n  time; she has a cut in her forehead. Whosoever will give an account\r\n  where she is to be found shall receive twenty guineas reward. Direct\r\n  for M. W. at the _George Inn_, Derby.”\r\n\r\nBesides the Dragon, St George is found in various other combinations, as\r\nthe GEORGE AND BLUE BOAR, High Holborn, an old inn lately come to its\r\nend. In the seventeenth century this house was called the BLUE BOAR, and\r\nis said to have been the house in which Cromwell and Ireton, disguised\r\nas common troopers, intercepted a letter of King Charles to his queen.\r\nCromwell, the story goes on to say, finding by this letter that his\r\nparty were not likely to obtain good terms from the king, “from that day\r\nforward resolved his ruin.”[416] Unfortunately for lovers of the\r\nromantic, there is no foundation for this dramatic incident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.\r\n\r\nGRINDING OLD INTO YOUNG.\r\n\r\n(From an old woodcut, circa 1720.)\r\n\r\nFIVE ALLS.\r\n\r\n(From an old print by Kay. The figures represent Dr Hunter, a famous\r\nScotch clergyman; Erskine the lawyer; a farmer; His Sacred Majesty\r\nGeorge III.; and the gentleman whose name should never be mentioned to\r\nears polite.)]\r\n\r\nThe GEORGE AND THIRTEEN CANTONS, kept by the great Bob Travers, is\r\nanother odd combination, occurring in Church Street, Soho; it is,\r\nhowever, easily explained when we learn that there is another\r\npublic-house called the THIRTEEN CANTONS, in King Street, also in Soho.\r\nThis sign was put up in reference to the thirteen Protestant cantons of\r\nSwitzerland--a compliment to the numerous Swiss who inhabit the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nBut the strangest combination of all is that of the GEORGE AND VULTURE.\r\nAt present there are three public-houses in London with this sign: one\r\nin St George-in-the-East, one in Wapping, and one in Haberdasher Street,\r\nHoxton. As in the “Live Vulture,” (see p. 224,) the only obvious\r\nexplanation for this strange combination seems to be the possibility of\r\na vulture having been exhibited at this house. Vultures were still\r\nconsidered great curiosities as late as the eighteenth century. In 1726,\r\none of the attractions at Peckham Fair was a menagerie, and amongst the\r\nanimals exhibited the vulture was described in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n  “The noble Vulture Cock, brought from Archangall, having the finest\r\n  talons of any bird that seeks her prey; the forepart of his head is\r\n  covered with hair; the second part resembles the wool of a black;\r\n  below that is a white ring, having a ruff that he cloaks his head with\r\n  at night.”\r\n\r\nIt is a name of some standing. “Near Ball Alley was the _George Inn_,\r\nsince the Fire, rebuilt with very good houses, well Inhabited, and\r\nwarehouses, being a large open yard, and called George Yard, at the\r\nfarther end of which is the GEORGE AND VULTURE Tavern, which is a large\r\nhouse and of a great trade, having a passage into St Michael’s Alley,”\r\n[Cornhill].[417] There was another tavern of this name on the east side\r\nof the high road, nearly opposite Bruce Green, Tottenham, in early times\r\nmuch frequented by the citizens of London taking their recreations. It\r\nis mentioned in the “Search after Claret” as early as 1691. Several\r\ncoins of the reign of Queen Elizabeth and Charles I. were discovered on\r\npulling down the old house. A coat of arms of Queen Elizabeth was fixed\r\nover the front door, but at the demolition of the building it was put\r\nup at the back of a house in Hale Lane. After the fashion of the time,\r\nthe house was duly puffed up in newspaper poems. The following is copied\r\nfrom a newspaper-cutting circa 1761-62, and as it enumerates the\r\nattractions of a suburban tea-garden of the period, may be quoted here\r\nat full length:--\r\n\r\n  “If lur’d to roam in Summer Hours,\r\n  Your Thoughts incline tow’rd Tott’nham Bow’rs.[418]\r\n  Here end your airing Tour and rest\r\n  Where _Cole_ invites each friendly Guest:\r\n  Intent on signs, the prying Eye,\r\n  The GEORGE AND VULTURE will descry;\r\n  Here the kind Landlord glad attends\r\n  To wellcome all his chearfull Friends\r\n  Who, leaving City smoke, delight\r\n  To range where various scenes invite.\r\n  The spacious garden, verdant Field,\r\n  Pleasures beyond Expression yield,\r\n  The Angler here to sport inclined\r\n  In his Canal may Pastime find.\r\n  Neat racy Wine and Home-brew’d Ale\r\n  The nicest Palates may regale,\r\n  Nectarious Punch--and (cleanly grac’d)\r\n  A Larder stor’d for ev’ry Taste.\r\n  The cautious Fair may sip with Glee\r\n  The fresh’st Coffee, finest Tea.\r\n  Let none the outward _Vulture_ fear,\r\n  No _Vulture_ host inhabits here,\r\n  If too well us’d you deem ye--then\r\n  Take your Revenge and come again.”\r\n\r\nSt Paul, the patron saint of London, was formerly a common sign in the\r\nmetropolis. One of the trades tokens of a house or tavern in Petty\r\nFrance, Westminster, represents the saint before his conversion, lying\r\non the ground, with his horse standing by him; this house was called\r\n“the SAUL.” Perhaps this was a monkish pleasantry of the period, (as\r\nWestminster was under the patronage of St Peter,) representing an\r\nunpleasant event in the history of the great patron, and showing, by\r\nsimple analogy, the vast superiority of the converted St Peter. The\r\nusual way, however, of commemorating the saint on the signboard was the\r\nST PAUL’S HEAD. This was the sign of a very old inn in Great Carter\r\nLane, (Doctors’ Commons,) opposite which Bagford lived in 1712. As an\r\ninn, it is mentioned by Machyn, in his Diary, in 1562. “The 25 may was a\r\nyonge man did hang ymseylff at the Polles Head, the inn in Carterlane.”\r\nTrades tokens of this house are extant in the Beaufoy Collection. In the\r\neighteenth century, most of the celebrated libraries were sold at this\r\ninn:[419] amongst others that of the bibliomaniac, Tom Rawlinson--the\r\nTom Folio of the _Tatler_, whose books were brought to the hammer\r\nbetween 1721-33--the sale extending to seventeen or eighteen separate\r\nauctions. The disposal of his MSS. alone occupied sixteen days. To this\r\ntavern formerly the new sheriffs, after having been sworn in, used to\r\nresort to receive the keys of the different jails; that ceremony\r\nterminated, they were regaled with sack and walnuts by the keeper of\r\nNewgate. The St Paul’s Coffee-house is built on the site of this old\r\ninn. About 1820 there was another PAUL’S HEAD in Cateaton Street, where\r\na literary club used to be held “for the cultivation of forensic\r\neloquence.” It was under the patronage of several distinguished\r\ncharacters, and had for a motto the modest words, “Sic itur ad astra.”\r\nThe vicinity of the cathedral evidently had suggested both these signs,\r\nas well as that exhibited by Philip Waterhouse, a bookseller “at the St\r\nPaul’s Head in Canning Street near Londonstone” in 1630. On another\r\nsign, in the same locality, the two saints were united, viz., the SAINT\r\nPETER AND SAINT PAUL, St Paul’s Churchyard. Of this house, also, trades\r\ntokens are extant.\r\n\r\nAlthough St Peter was, doubtless, as common on the signboard before the\r\nReformation as the other great saints of religious history, yet no\r\ninstances of this have come down to us. His keys, however--the famous\r\nCross Keys--are very common. At Dawdley, and on the road between\r\nWarminster and Salisbury, there is a very curious sign called PETER’S\r\nFINGER, which is believed to occur nowhere else. In all probability this\r\nrefers to the benediction of the Pope, the finger of his Holiness being\r\nraised whilst bestowing a blessing. St Peter being the first of the\r\nPapal line, was doubtless often represented with his finger raised in\r\nold pictures and carvings. The following passage from Bishop Hall’s\r\n“Satires” alludes to the finger:--\r\n\r\n  “But walk on cheerly ’till thou have espied\r\n  _St Peter’s finger_, at the churchyard side.”--Book v., sat. 2.\r\n\r\nSt Dunstan, the patron saint of the parish of that name in London, was\r\ngodfather to the DEVIL,--that is to say, to the sign of the famous\r\ntavern of the DEVIL AND ST DUNSTAN, within Temple Bar. The legend runs,\r\nthat one day, when working at his trade of a goldsmith, he was sorely\r\ntempted by the devil, and at length got so exasperated that he took the\r\nred hot tongs out of the fire and caught his infernal majesty by the\r\nnose. The identical pinchers with which this feat was performed are\r\nstill preserved at Mayfield Palace, in Sussex. They are of a very\r\nrespectable size, and formidable enough to frighten the arch one\r\nhimself. This episode in the saint’s life was represented on the\r\nsignboard of that glorious old tavern. By way of abbreviation, this\r\nhouse was called THE DEVIL, though the landlord seems to have preferred\r\nthe _other_ saint’s name; for on his token we read: “_The D----_ (sic)\r\n_and Dunstan_,” probably fearing, with a classic dread, the ill omen of\r\nthat awful name.\r\n\r\nAllusions to this tavern are innumerable in the dramatists; one of the\r\nearliest is in 1563, in the play of “Jack Jugeler.” William Rowley thus\r\nmentions it in his comedy of a “Match by Midnight,” 1633:--\r\n\r\n  “_Bloodhound._ As you come by Temple Bar make a step to the Devil.\r\n\r\n  _Tim._ To the Devil, father?\r\n\r\n  _Sim._ My master means the sign of the Devil, and he cannot hurt you,\r\n  fool; there’s a saint holds him by the nose.\r\n\r\n  _Tim._ Sniggers, what does the devil and a saint both on a sign?\r\n\r\n  _Sim._ What a question is that? What does my master and his\r\n  prayer-book o’ Sundays both in a pew?”\r\n\r\nSo fond was Ben Jonson of this tavern, that he lived “without Temple\r\nBar, at a combmaker’s shop,” according to Aubrey, in order to be near\r\nhis favourite haunt. It must have been, therefore, in a moment of\r\nill-humour, when he found fault with the wine, and made the statement\r\nthat his play of the “Devil is an Ass,” (which is certainly not amongst\r\nhis best,) was written “when I and my boys drank bad wine at the Devil.”\r\nBut surely he would not have established his favourite Apollo Club at a\r\nplace where they sold bad wine. He himself composed the famous “Leges\r\nConviviales” for this club, which are still preserved, with the respect\r\ndue to so sacred a relic, in the banking house of Messrs Child & Co.,\r\nerected in 1788 on the place where the tavern formerly stood. They are\r\ntwenty-four in number, some of them rather characteristic:--\r\n\r\n  “4. And the more to exact our delight whilst we stay,\r\n      Let none be debarr’d from his choice female mate.\r\n\r\n   5. Let no scent offensive the chamber infest.\r\n\r\n  10. Let our wines without mixture or scum be all fine,\r\n      Or call up the master and break his dull noddle.\r\n\r\n  16. With mirth, wit, and dancing, and singing conclude,\r\n      To regale every sense with delight in excess.\r\n\r\n  21. For generous lovers let a corner be found,\r\n      Where they in soft sighs may their passions relieve.”\r\n\r\nThe last clause was, “Focus perennis esto,” which proves that rare old\r\nBen understood comfort. Latin inscriptions were also in other parts of\r\nthe house. Over the clock in the kitchen might have been seen, as late\r\nas 1731, “Si nocturna tibi noceat potatio vini, hoc in mane bibis\r\niterum, et erit medicina.”[420] An elegant rendering of the well-known\r\nphrase, “A hair of the dog that bit you.” Not only Ben Jonson, but\r\nalmost all the great poets of two centuries, honoured this house with\r\ntheir presence. “I dined to-day,” says Swift, in one of his letters to\r\nStella, “with Dr Garth and Mr Addison, at the Devil Tavern, near Temple\r\nBar, and Garth treated.” Numerous similar quotations might be found,\r\nshowing the visits to this place of nearly all the great literary stars\r\nof the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nSimon Wadloe was one of the most famous landlords of this tavern. Pepys,\r\nApril 22, 1661,--“Wadlow, the Vintner at the Devil, in Fleet Street, did\r\nlead a fine company of soldiers, all young comely men, in white\r\nDoublets” (this was on Charles II. going from the Tower to Whitehall.)\r\nBen Jonson called him the king of skinkers.[421] Among the verses on the\r\ndoor of the Apollo room occurred the lines--\r\n\r\n  “Hang up all the poor hop drinkers,\r\n  Cries old Sim, the king of skinkers.”\r\n\r\nCamden, in his “Remains,” records the following epitaph on this\r\nworthy:--\r\n\r\n      “Apollo et cohors Musarum,\r\n      Bacchus vini et uvarum,\r\n      Ceres pro pane et cervisia,\r\n      Adeste omnes cum tristitia.\r\n  Diique, Deæque, lamentate cuncti,\r\n  Simonis Vadloe funera defuncti,\r\n  Sub _signo malo_ bene vixit, mirabile!\r\n  Si ad cœlum recessit gratias _Diaboli_.”[422]\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this _Old Devil_ a YOUNG DEVIL Tavern was opened, also\r\nin Fleet Street, in 1707, and here the first meetings of the Society of\r\nAntiquaries were held, but the “Young Devil” was not a success, and the\r\nhouse was soon closed.\r\n\r\nThough the Devil is not a promising name for a public-house, owing to\r\nhis near connexion with evil _spirits_, yet there was a third tavern\r\nnamed after--if not devoted to him--the LITTLE DEVIL, Goodman’s Fields,\r\nWhitechapel. Ned Ward, in 1703, highly commends the punch of this house,\r\nwhich he partook of in “a room neat enough to entertain Venus and the\r\ngraces.” It was a house entirely after jolly Ned’s fancy. “My landlord\r\nwas good company, my landlady good humoured, her daughter charmingly\r\npretty, and her maid tolerably handsome, who can laugh, cry, say her\r\nprayers, sing a song, all in a breath, and can turn in a minute to all\r\nsublunary points of a female compass.”[423]\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL (_le Diable_) was also a celebrated tavern in Paris, near the\r\nPalais de Justice. It is thus named in the “Ode à tous les Cabarets:”--\r\n\r\n  “Lieux sacrés où l’on est soumis\r\n  Aux saints oracles de Themis,\r\n  Encor que vous ayez la gloire,\r\n  De voir tout le monde à genoux,\r\n  Sans le _Diable_ et la _Tête-Noire_;[424]\r\n  Je n’approcherais pas de vous.”[425]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century Paris also had its _Petit Diable_, (Little\r\nDevil,) a tavern of some renown.\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL’S HOUSE was the name of a favourite Sunday resort in the last\r\ncentury, in the Hornsey Road, Islington. It is said to have been the\r\nretreat of Claude Duval (_unde_ Duval’s house, Devil’s house,) the\r\nelegant highwayman in the reign of Charles II., who infested the lanes\r\nabout Islington; but from a survey taken in 1611, it appears that the\r\nhouse bore already at that time the name of “Devil’s House.” From its\r\ngeneral appearance it seemed to date from Queen Elizabeth’s reign. It\r\nwas surrounded by a moat filled with water, and passed by a wooden\r\nbridge. Its attractions are held forth in the following laudatory\r\nepistle, an example of the florid and poetical advertising in vogue when\r\nRichardson wrote novels of six volumes all in letters--compositions too\r\npainfully pathetic for our matter-of-fact age:--\r\n\r\n  “_To the Printer of the Publick Advertiser_.\r\n\r\n  “Sir,--Returning yesterday from a rural excursion to Hornsey, I\r\n  casually stopped for a little refreshment at an house, commonly known\r\n  by the name of _Devil’s House_, situated within two fields of\r\n  Holloway-Turnpike. I own that I was vastly surprised at so charming\r\n  and delightful a place, so near town, and at the great improvements\r\n  lately made there. The garden is well laid out, encompassed with a\r\n  beautiful moat, and a good canal in the orchard. On inquiry, I found\r\n  the landlord (remarkable for his civil and obliging behaviour) had\r\n  stocked the same with plenty of tench, carp, and other fish, with free\r\n  liberty for his customers to angle therein. Tea and hot loaves are\r\n  ready at a moment’s notice, and new milk from the cows grazing in the\r\n  pleasant meadows adjoining, with a good larder, and the best wines,\r\n  &c. In short, I know not a more agreeable place, where persons of both\r\n  sexes of genteel taste may enjoy a more innocent and delightful\r\n  amusement. But what surprised me most, was that the landlord, by a\r\n  peculiar turn of invention, had changed the _Devil’s House_ to the\r\n  _Summer House_,--a name I find it is for the future to be\r\n  distinguished by. I wish, Mr Printer, your readers as much pleasure as\r\n  myself, and am, sir, your constant reader,\r\n\r\n  “H. G.\r\n\r\n  “_May 25, 1767_.”\r\n\r\nAt Royston, Herts, there is a public-house known as the DEVIL’S HEAD.\r\nThere is no signboard, but a carved representation of his satanic\r\nmajesty’s head projects from the building, the name being underneath.\r\n\r\nST PATRICK is exclusively an Irish sign. He is generally represented in\r\nthe costume of a bishop, driving a flock of snakes, toads, and other\r\nvermin before him, which he is said to have banished from Ireland. His\r\nlife is more replete with miracles than any of the other saints.\r\n\r\n  “St Patrick was a gentleman,\r\n  And came of dacent people,”\r\n\r\nfor his father was a noble Roman, who lived at Kirkpatrick, in Scotland.\r\nThe saint’s life was very active; he founded 365 churches, ordained 365\r\nbishops, and 3000 priests, converted 12,000 persons in one district,\r\nbaptized seven kings at once, established a purgatory, and with his\r\nstaff expelled every reptile that stung or croaked. This last feat,\r\nhowever, has been performed by a great many saints in different parts of\r\nthe world. Not so the feat he performed at his _death_, when, having\r\nbeen beheaded, he coolly took his head under his arm, (or, according to\r\nthe best authorities, in his mouth,) and swam over the Shannon. In such\r\ncases as the Bishop of Narbonne said about St Denis, (who walked from\r\nMontmartre to St Denis with his head under his arm,) “_il n’y a que le\r\npremier pas qui coute_.”[426]\r\n\r\nIn many instances, no doubt, before the Reformation, the shopkeeper\r\nwould choose his patron saint for his sign, to act as a sort of lares\r\nand penates to his house. An example of this occurs on the following\r\nimprint:--“Manual of Prayers, 1539. Imprynted in Bottol [St Botolph’s]\r\nLane, at the sygne of the WHYT BEARE, by me, Jhon Mayler, for John\r\nWaylande, and be to sell in Powles Churchyarde, by Andrew Hester, at the\r\nWHYT HORSE, and also by _Mychel_ Lobley, _at the sygne of the_ SAINT\r\nMYCHEL;” this last bookseller, therefore, had chosen his own patron\r\nsaint for his sign. For the same reason another bookseller adopted, in\r\nthe early part of the sixteenth century, SAINT JOHN THE EVANGELIST--“The\r\nDoctrynall of Good Servauntes. Imprynted at London, in Flete Strete, at\r\nthe sygne of Saynt Johan Evangelyste, by me, _Johan_ Butler.” This\r\nButler was a judge of the Common Pleas, as well as a bookseller. About\r\nthe same period the Evangelist was also the sign of another man of the\r\nsame profession--“Robert Wyce, dwellinge at the sygne of Seynt Johan\r\nEuāgelyst, in Seynt Martyns parysshe, in the filde besyde Charynge\r\nCrosse, in the bysshop of Norwytche rentys.” He was the printer of the\r\nwell-known “Pronostycacion for ever of Erra Pater; a Jewe borne in\r\nJewry, a doctor in Astronomye and Physicke,” which was continued for\r\nages after him. Robert Wyce must have been about the first bookseller\r\nand printer in this neighbourhood, as in Queen Elizabeth’s reign the\r\nparish contained less than one hundred people liable to be rated.[427]\r\nWe find the same as one of the oldest printer’s signs in France, on an\r\nedition of Merlin’s Prophecies, printed at Paris in 1438, by Abraham\r\nVerard, dwelling near the church of Notre Dame, at the sign of St John\r\nthe Evangelist.\r\n\r\nOther saints, again, have a local reputation, and are perpetuated on the\r\nsignboards in certain localities only, as for instance ST THOMAS of\r\nCanterbury; ST EDMUND’S HEAD, at Bury St Edmunds; and ST CUTHBERT, at\r\nMonk’s house, near Sunderland. This saint was the first bishop of\r\nNorthumberland.\r\n\r\n  “But fain St Hilda’s nuns would learn,\r\n  If on a rock by Lindisfarne,\r\n  St Cuthbert sits and toils to frame\r\n  The seaborn weeds which bear his name,”\r\n\r\nsays Sir Walter Scott, alluding to the stalks of the Encrinites, which\r\nare called St Cuthbert’s Beads, the saint, as the story goes, amusing\r\nhimself by stringing them together.\r\n\r\nHugh Singleton, a bookseller in the sixteenth century, lived at the sign\r\nof the ST AUGUSTINE; probably he had chosen this saint from the fact of\r\nhis being a distinguished writer as well as saint. George Carter, a\r\nshopkeeper in the seventeenth century, adopted ST ALBAN, the\r\nprotomartyr, as his sign, evidently for no other reason but because he\r\nlived in “St Alban’s Street, near St James’s Market;” and another,\r\nWilliam Ellis of Tooley Street, had the sign of ST CLEMENT, perhaps on\r\naccount of his being a native of the parish of St Clement’s. Trades\r\ntokens of both these houses are to be seen in the Beaufoy Collection.\r\n\r\nSt Laurent was the sign of an inn in Lawrence Lane, Cheapside, but from\r\na border of blossoms or flowers round it, it was commonly called\r\nBLOSSOMS, or by corruption, BOSOM’S INN--such at least is the\r\nexplanation of Stow:--\r\n\r\n  “Antiquities in this lane--[St Laurence Lane, Cheapside]--I find none\r\n  other than that, among many fair houses, there is one large inn for\r\n  the receipt of travellers called _Blossom’s Inn_, but corruptly\r\n  _Bosom’s Inn_, and hath to sign St Laurence the deacon in a border of\r\n  blossoms or flowers.”\r\n\r\nFlowers are said to have sprung up at the martyrdom of this saint, who\r\nwas roasted alive on a gridiron. But in the “History of Thomas of\r\nReading,” ch. ii., another version is given, which seems, however,\r\nlittle else than a joke:--\r\n\r\n  “Our jolly clothiers kept up their courage and went to Bosom’s Inn, so\r\n  called from a greasy old fellow who built it, who always went nudging\r\n  with his head in his _bosom_ winter and summer, so that they called\r\n  him the picture of old Winter.”\r\n\r\nIn 1522 the Emperor Charles V. honoured Henry VIII. with a visit; at\r\nfirst his intention was to come with a retinue of 2044 persons and 1127\r\nhorses, but subsequently he reduced them to 2000 persons and 1000\r\nhorses. To lodge these visitors, various “inns for horses” were “seen\r\nand viewed,” amongst which “St Laurance, otherwise called Bosoms Yn,” is\r\nnoted down to have “xx beddes and a stable for lx horses.”[428] It is\r\ncurious, in this list of inns, to observe the proportion of beds as\r\ncompared with stabling room, showing how most of the followers of a\r\nnobleman on a journey had to shift for themselves and sleep in the straw\r\nor elsewhere. On the occasion of this imperial visit, the city\r\nauthorities were evidently afraid of being drunk dry by the many\r\nFlemings in the train of the Emperor. To avoid this calamity, a return\r\nwas made of all the wine to be found at the eleven wine merchants, and\r\nthe twenty-eight principal taverns then in London, the sum total of\r\nwhich was 809 pipes.[429]\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century the house seems already to have been famous as\r\na carrier’s inn, (which it continued for three centuries,) as appears\r\nfrom the following allusion:--“Yet have I naturally cherisht and hugt it\r\nin my bosome, even as a carrier at Bosome’s Inne doth a cheese under his\r\narms.”[430] A satirical tract about Banks and his horse “Marocius\r\nExtaticus,” (reprinted by the Percy Society,) gives the names of its\r\nauthors as “John Dando the wiredrawer of Hadley, and Harrie Hunt, head\r\nostler of _Besomes Inne_.” Another domestic of this establishment is\r\nhanded down to posterity in Ben Jonson’s “Masque of Christmass,”\r\npresented at Court in 1616, where the following lines occur:--\r\n\r\n  “But now comes Tom of _Bosom’s Inn_,\r\n  And he presenteth Misrule.”[431]\r\n\r\nThe CATHERINE WHEEL was formerly a very common sign, most likely adopted\r\nfrom its being the badge of the order of the knights of Saint Catherine\r\nof Mount Sinai, created anno 1063, for the protection of pilgrims on\r\ntheir way to and from the Holy Sepulchre. Hence it was a suggestive, if\r\nnot eloquent sign for an inn, as it intimated that the host was of the\r\nbrotherhood, although in a humble way, and would protect the travellers\r\nfrom robbery in his inn,--in the shape of high charges and\r\nexactions,--just as the knights of St Catherine protected them on the\r\nhigh road from robbery by brigands. These knights wore a white habit\r\nembroidered with a Catherine wheel, (_i.e._ a wheel armed with spikes,)\r\nand traversed with a sword stained with blood.[432] There were also\r\nmysteries in which St Catherine played a favourite part, one of which\r\nwas acted by young ladies on the entry of Queen Catherine of Arragon\r\n(queen to our Henry VIII.) in London in 1501; in honour of this queen\r\nthe sign may occasionally have been put up. The Catherine wheel was also\r\na charge in the Turners’ arms. Flecknoe tells us, in his “Enigmatical\r\nCharacters,” (1658,) that the Puritans changed it into the CAT AND\r\nWHEEL, under which name it is still to be seen on a public-house at\r\nCastle Green, Bristol. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the\r\nCatherine Wheel was a famous carrier’s inn in Southwark; and at the\r\npresent day there is still an old public-house in Bishopsgate Street\r\nWithout, inscribed, “Ye old Catherine Wheel, 1594.”[433]\r\n\r\nBesides these, there were other signs expressing a religious idea, such\r\nas the HEART IN BIBLE, which occurs under one of the Luttrell\r\nBallads:--“The Citizens’ joys for the Rebuilding of London, printed by\r\nP. Lillicross, for Richard Head, at the HEART IN BIBLE, in Little\r\nBritain, where you may have Mr Matthews, his approved and universal\r\npills for all diseases, 1667.” Another bookseller on London Bridge,\r\nEliz. Smith, 1691, had the HAND AND BIBLE. Biblical phrases also were\r\nemployed, as for instance, the LION AND LAMB, which occurs on several\r\nseventeenth century trades tokens of Snowhill, Southwark, &c., and is\r\nstill much in vogue. It is an emblematical representation of the\r\nMillennium, when “the lion shall lie down by the kid.” In the last\r\ncentury there was a Lion and Lamb on a signboard at Sheffield, with the\r\nfollowing poetical effusion:--\r\n\r\n  “If the Lyon show’d kill the Lamb,\r\n  We’ll kill the Lyon--if we can;\r\n  But if the Lamb show’d kill the Lyon,\r\n  We’ll kill the Lamb to make a Pye on.”\r\n\r\nThe antithesis to this sign, namely, the WOLF AND LAMB, occurs\r\noccasionally, as in Charles Street, Leicester, and in a few other\r\nplaces. In Grosvenor Street it was probably once represented by a lion\r\nand a kid, but the public, not minding the text, called the sign the\r\nLION AND GOAT, and that name it still bears. THE LION AND ADDER,\r\nNottingham, Newark, and various other places, or the LION AND SNAKE, as\r\nat Bailgate, Lincoln, come from Psalm xci. 13, where the godly are\r\nreminded:--“Thou shalt tread upon the _Lion and Adder_, the young lion\r\nand the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.” These two signs\r\napparently came in use during the Commonwealth. They have a decided\r\nflavour of the time when Scripture language formed the common speech of\r\nevery day life.\r\n\r\nThe LAMB AND FLAG is another sign common all over England, representing\r\noriginally the holy lamb with the nimbus and banner, but now so little\r\nunderstood by the publicans, that on an alehouse at Swindon, it is\r\npictured with a spear, to which a red-white-and-blue streamer is\r\nappended. It may also be of heraldic origin, for it was the coat of arms\r\nof the Templars, and the crest of the merchant tailors. The LAMB AND\r\nANCHOR, Milk Street, Bristol, seems to be a mystical representation of\r\nhope in Christ; both these last signs date from before the Reformation.\r\nFrom that period also dates the sign of the BLEEDING HEART, the\r\nemblematical representation of the five sorrowful mysteries of the\r\nRosary, viz., the heart of the Holy Virgin pierced with five swords.\r\nThere is still an ale-house of this name in Charles Street, Hatton\r\nGarden, and Bleeding Heart Yard, adjoining the public-house, is\r\nimmortalised in “Little Dorrit.” The WOUNDED HEART, one of the signs in\r\nNorwich in 1750,[434] had the same meaning. The Heart was a constant\r\nemblem of the Holy Virgin in the middle ages; thus, on the clog\r\nalmanacs, all the feasts of St Mary were indicated by a heart. It was\r\nnot an uncommon sign in former times. The HEART AND BALL appears on a\r\ntrades token as the sign of a house in Little Britain, the Ball being\r\nsimply some silk mercer’s addition; and the GOLDEN HEART[435] was a sign\r\nin Greenwich in 1737, next door to which Dr Johnson used to live when he\r\nwas newly come to town, and wrote the Parliamentary articles for the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_. At present there are three public-houses with\r\nthis sign in Bristol, and in other places it may be met with.\r\n\r\nHEAVEN was a house of entertainment near Westminster Hall; the present\r\ncommittee rooms of the House of Commons are erected on its site. Butler\r\nalludes to this house in “Hudibras,” p. 3:--\r\n\r\n  “False Heaven at the end of the Hall.”\r\n\r\nPepys records his dining at this house in the winter of 1660, and with\r\ndue respect for the place, he put on his best fur cap for the occasion.\r\n“I sent a porter to bring my best fur cap, and so I returned and went to\r\nHeaven; where Luellin and I dined.”\r\n\r\nPARADISE was a messuage in the same neighbourhood, and HELL AND\r\nPURGATORY subterranean passages; but in the reign of James I. HELL was\r\nthe sign of a low public-house frequented by lawyers’ clerks. HEAVEN AND\r\nHELL are mentioned, together with a third house called PURGATORY, in an\r\nold grant dated the first year of Henry VII.[436] The THREE KINGS is a\r\nsign representing the three Eastern magi or kings, who came to do homage\r\nto our Saviour. We find it used as early as the sixteenth century by\r\nJulyan Notary, in St Paul’s Churchyard, one of the earliest London\r\nprinters. The Three Kings was formerly a constant mercer’s sign. Bagford\r\ngives the following reason for this:--\r\n\r\n  “Mersers in thouse dayes war Genirall Marchantes and traded in all\r\n  sortes of Rich Goodes, besides those of scelckes (silks) as they do\r\n  nou at this day: but they brought into England fine Leninn thered\r\n  (linen thread) gurdeles (girdles) finenly worked from Collin[437]\r\n  (Cologne.) Collin, the city which then at that time of day florished\r\n  much and afforded rayre commodetes, and these merchāts that vsually\r\n  traded to that citye, set vp ther singes ouer ther dores of ther\r\n  Houses the three kinges of Collin, with the Armes of that Citye, which\r\n  was the THREE CROUENS of the former kings in memorye of them, and by\r\n  those singes the people knew in what wares they deld in.”[438]\r\n\r\nThere is and was until lately such a sign carved in stone in front of a\r\nhouse in Bucklersbury, which street was once the head quarters of the\r\nmercers and perfumers. The three kings stood in a row, all in the same\r\ngarb and position, with their sceptres shouldered. The history of the\r\nThree Kings was a favourite story in the middle ages. Wynkyn de Worde\r\nprinted, anno 1516, “The Lives of the Three Kinges of Collen.” The same\r\nsubject had been printed in Paris in 1498 by Tresyrel: “La Vie des Troys\r\nRoys, Balchazar, Melchior, et Gaspard.” They also appeared in many of\r\nthe ancient plays and mysteries. In one of the Chester pageants, acted\r\nby the shearmen and tailors, they are called Sir Jasper of Tars; Sir\r\nMelchior, king of Araby; Sir Balthazer, king of Saba; they enjoy the\r\nsame names and kingdoms in the “Comédie de l’Adoration des Trois Roys,”\r\nby Marguerite de Valois. Their offerings are recorded in the following\r\ncharm against falling sickness:--\r\n\r\n  “Jaspar fert myrrham, thus Melchior, Balthazar aurum,\r\n  Hæc tria qui secum portabit nomina regum\r\n  Solvitur a morbo, Christi pietate, caduco.”[439]\r\n\r\nAnother Latin distich has--\r\n\r\n  “Tres Reges Regi Regum tria dona firebant\r\n  Myrrham Homini, uncto aurum, thura dedere Deo.”[440]\r\n\r\nMelchior was usually represented as a bearded old man, Jasper as a\r\nbeardless youth, and Balchazar as a Moor with a large beard.\r\n\r\nThis sign was as common on the Continent as in England, and at the\r\npresent day it may often be met with. Eustache Deschamps, in the\r\nsixteenth century, thus celebrated the good cheer of one of the taverns\r\nin Paris:--\r\n\r\n  “Prince, par la Vierge Marie,\r\n  On est à la Cossonerie,\r\n  Aux Caunettes ou _aux Trois Rois_.”\r\n\r\n_L’Adoration des Trois Rois_ was, in 1674, the sign of François Muguet,\r\none of the Parisian booksellers.\r\n\r\nNot unlikely the sign of the KINGS AND KEYS, a tavern in Fleet Street,\r\nis an abbreviation of the _Three Kings and Cross Keys_. At\r\nWeston-super-Mare, and at Chelmsforth, there is another sign which owes\r\nits origin to the Three Kings, namely, the THREE QUEENS. When, in 1764,\r\nthe Paving Act for St James’ was put into execution, the sign of the\r\nThree Queens, in Clerkenwell Green, was removed at a cost of upwards of\r\n£200; it extended not less than seven feet from the front of the house.\r\n_Lloyd’s Evening Post_, January 12-14, 1761, tells how two sharpers came\r\nto this ale-house and stole the silver tankard in which their drink was\r\nserved them. Each tavern in those days possessed a number of silver\r\ntankards, in which the well-dressed customers were served with sack and\r\ncanary. It may be imagined that the thieves were quietly on the look-out\r\nfor such a prize. The same paper gives an advertisement about two silver\r\npints stolen from the JOLLY BUTCHERS at Bath; in fact, similar\r\nadvertisements were of almost daily occurrence. “The Praise of Yorkshire\r\nAle,” 1685, also mentions--\r\n\r\n                “Selling of Ale, in Muggs,\r\n  _Silver Tankards_, Black Pots, and Little Juggs.”\r\n\r\nOne other semi-religious legend has provided a subject for many a\r\nsignboard, namely, the MAN IN THE MOON. Though this cannot strictly be\r\nstyled a religious legend, yet it may be included in this class, as the\r\nidea is said to have originated from the incident given in Numbers xv.\r\n32, _et seq._, “And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness,\r\nthey found a man that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath-day,” &c. Not\r\ncontent with having him stoned for this desecration of the day, the\r\nlegend transferred him to the moon. It is, however, a Christian legend,\r\nfor the Jews had some Talmudical story about Jacob being in the moon; in\r\nfact, almost every nation, whether ancient or modern, sees somebody in\r\nit. The Man in the Moon occurs on a seventeenth century token of a\r\ntavern in Cheapside, represented by a half-naked man within a crescent,\r\nholding on by the horns. There is still a sign of this description in\r\nLittle Vine Street, Regent Street, and in various other places.\r\nGenerally he is represented with a bundle of sticks, a lanthorn (which,\r\none would think, he did not want in the moon,) and frequently a dog.\r\nThus Chaucer depicts him in “Cresseide,” v. 260:--\r\n\r\n  “Her gite was gray and full of spottes blacke,\r\n  And on her breast a chorl painted full even,\r\n  Bearing a bush of thorns on his backe,\r\n  Which for his theft might clime no ner y^{e} heven.”\r\n\r\nShakespeare also alludes to him:--\r\n\r\n  “_Steph._ I was the Man in the Moon when time was.\r\n\r\n  “_Caliban._ I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee; my mistress\r\n  showed me thee, thy dog and bush.”--_Tempest_, ii., sc. 2.\r\n\r\nAlso--\r\n\r\n  “_Quince._ One must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorn, and\r\n  say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of\r\n  moonshine.”--_Midsummer Night’s Dream_, iii., sc. 1.\r\n\r\nThis bunch of thorns is alluded to by Dante, “Inferno,” canto xx. 124,\r\nwhere the Man in the Moon is spoken of as Cain--\r\n\r\n  “Ma viene omai: che gia tiene il confine\r\n  D’amendue gli emisperi e tocca l’onda\r\n  Sotto Sibilia _Caino è le spine_.”[441]\r\n\r\nAnd again in “Paradiso,” canto ii. 49, speaking of the moon, he asks--\r\n\r\n  “Ma detemi, che sono i segni bui\r\n  Di questi corpo, che laggiuso in terra\r\n  Fan di Cain favoleggiare altrui?”[442]\r\n\r\nAnd the annotators of Dante say that Cain was placed in the moon with a\r\nbundle of thorns on his back, similar to those he had placed on the\r\naltar when he offered to the Lord his unwelcome sacrifice. This Man in\r\nthe Moon, whether Cain, Jacob, or the Sabbath-breaker, has been\r\ncelebrated by innumerable songs. Alex. Neckham (recently edited by Mr T.\r\nWright) refers to him from a very ancient ballad, and one of the oldest\r\nsongs is in the Harl. MSS., 2253, beginning:--\r\n\r\n  “Mon in the mone stond and streit,\r\n  On is bot-forke is burthen he bereth,\r\n  Hit is muche wonder that he na doun slyt\r\n  For doute lest he valle he shoddreth and skereth.\r\n  When the forst freseth muche chele he byd\r\n  The thornes beth kene is hattren to-tereth\r\n  N’is no wytht in the world that wot when he syt\r\n  Ne, bote hit bee the hegge, whot wedes he wereth.”\r\n\r\nFor all this, his life seems to be very merry, for one of the Roxburghe\r\nBallads (i. f., 298) informs us that--\r\n\r\n  “Our Man in the Moon drinks Clarret,\r\n  With powderbeef, turnep and carret;\r\n  If he doth so, why should not you\r\n  Drink until the sky looks blue.”\r\n\r\nFrom whence they obtained the information it is difficult to say, but it\r\nwas a well-established fact with the old tobacconists that he could\r\nenjoy his pipe. Thus he is represented on some of the tobacconists’\r\npapers in the Banks Collection puffing like a steam-engine, and\r\nunderneath the words, “Who’ll smoake with y^{e} Man in y^{e} Moon?” If\r\nthese frequent allusions in songs and plays were not enough to remind\r\nthe Londoners that there was such a being, they could see him daily\r\namongst the figures of old St Paul’s--\r\n\r\n  “The Great Dial is your last monument; where bestow some half of the\r\n  three score minutes to observe the sauciness of the Jacks[443] that\r\n  are above the _Man in the Moon_ there; the strangeness of their motion\r\n  will quit your labour.”--DECKER’S _Gull’s Hornbook_.\r\n\r\n[402] Coryatt’s Crudities, London, 1776, p. 15, reprinted from the\r\nedition of 1611.\r\n\r\n[403] In those early days the sign alone of a house was not thought to\r\ngive sufficient publicity. Touters (_crieurs_) were therefore sent about\r\ntown (a custom dating from the Romans.) Thus in the “Crieries de Paris,”\r\n(Barbazan, Fabliaux et Contes, vol. ii., p. 277,)--\r\n\r\n  “D’autres cris on fait plusieurs,\r\n  Qui long seraient à reciter.\r\n  L’on crie vin nouveau et vieux,\r\n  Duquel l’on donne à tater.”\r\n\r\nThese touters had their statutes and privileges granted to them by\r\nPhilip Auguste in 1258, some of which are very curious.\r\n\r\n[404] Not only had the innkeepers saints on their signboards, but the\r\ndifferent reception-rooms in their houses were also sanctified with some\r\nholy name. Artus Desiré quaintly inveighs against this practice in his\r\n“Loyaulté Consciencieuse des Tavernières:”--\r\n\r\n  “Semblablement toutes leurs chambres painctes,\r\n    Où il n’y a qu’ordure et ivrognise,\r\n  Portent les noms de benoistz sainctz et sainctes\r\n    Contre l’honneur de Dieu et son Eglise.\r\n  L’une s’apelle, à leur mode et devize,\r\n  Le _Paradis_ et l’autre _Sainct Clement_.\r\n  Et quant quelqu’un rabaste fermement,\r\n  L’hostesse crie André, Guillot, Mornable,\r\n  Laisse-moy tout, et va legerement\r\n  En _Paradis_, compter de par le Diable.\r\n            S’on si veut chauffer,\r\n            Portent le faggot\r\n            Robin avec Margot,\r\n            De par Lucifer.”\r\n\r\n(“In the same manner all their painted rooms, in which there is nothing\r\nbut filth and drunkenness, are named after some blessed saint, contrary\r\nto the respect due to the Lord and His Church. According to this custom\r\none is called the Paradise, and another St Clement. And if anybody\r\nhiggles about his bill the hostess calls out, Andrew, Will, Mornable,\r\nleave everything, and run quickly up to the Paradise to make out the\r\nbill, in the Devil’s name. And if anybody wants a fire, Bob or Maggy has\r\nto carry up a faggot in the name of Lucifer.”)\r\n\r\n[405]\r\n\r\n  “This is Saint Crispin, but my name is Kit,\r\n  I make boots, shoes, and slippers.”\r\n\r\n[406]\r\n\r\n  “Here at the Crispin any man may for his money\r\n  Immediately obtain shoes made out of animals’ skins;\r\n  But many a brute in this town wears a human skin,\r\n  Nay, wears his own brother’s skin, and the brute looks even well in\r\n  it”\r\n\r\n[407] So were Crispin and Crispian, and hence the trade is called the\r\n“Gentle Craft.”\r\n\r\n[408] The gayest city in Europe three centuries ago.\r\n\r\n[409]\r\n\r\n  “You have said\r\n  St Julian’s prayer this morning,\r\n  Either in French or in Latin,\r\n  Now you are sure to be well lodged.”\r\n\r\n[410]\r\n\r\n  “We are entirely at your service.\r\n  By S. Peter the good apostle\r\n  You shall have St Julian inn (or welcome.)”\r\n\r\n[411]\r\n\r\n  “Often good wine makes them say,\r\n  That they have the inn of St Martin.”\r\n\r\n[412]\r\n\r\n  “Thus they had at his expense the inn of St Martin.”\r\n\r\n[413]\r\n\r\n  “Whosoever sees the image of St Christopher,\r\n  Shall that day not feel any sickness.”\r\n\r\n[414]\r\n\r\n  “The day that you see St Christopher’s face,\r\n  That day shall you not die an evil death. 1423.”\r\n\r\n[415] Aubrey, Remains of Judaism and Gentilism.

With this scrap of paper in his\r\npossession, he had considered himself quite safe from detection.\r\n\r\n[440]\r\n\r\n  “Three kings brought three gifts to the King of Kings.\r\n  They gave myrrh to him as man, gold as king, and frankincense as God.”\r\n\r\n[441]\r\n\r\n  “But come now, for already hovers Cain with his bundle of thorns\r\n  On the confines of the two hemispheres, and touches the\r\n  Waves beneath Seville.”\r\n\r\n[442]\r\n\r\n  “But tell me, what are the dark spots\r\n  On that body, which makes them down there on earth\r\n  Talk of Cain and the bundle of thorns!”\r\n\r\n[443] Paul’s Jacks were the little automaton figures that struck the\r\nhours in old St Paul’s. Similar puppets, or figures, were also on other\r\nLondon churches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDIGNITIES, TRADES, AND PROFESSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTools and utensils, as emblems of trade, were certainly placed outside\r\nhouses at an early period, to inform the illiterate public of the\r\nparticular trade or occupation carried on within. Centuries ago the\r\npractice, as a general rule, fell into disuse, although a few trades\r\nstill adhere to it with laudable perseverance: thus a _broom_ informs us\r\nwhere to find a sweep; a _gilt arm_ wielding a hammer tells us where the\r\ngold-beater lives; and a _last_ or _gilt shoe_ where to order a pair of\r\nboots. Those houses of refreshment and general resort, which sought the\r\ncustom of particular trades and professions, also very frequently\r\nadopted the tools and emblems of those trades as their distinguishing\r\nsigns. At other houses, again, signs were set up as tributes of respect\r\nto certain dignities and functions. Amongst the latter, the KING’S HEAD\r\nand QUEEN’S HEAD stand foremost, and none were more prominent types than\r\nHenry VIII. and Queen Elizabeth, even for more than two centuries after\r\ntheir decease. Only fifty or sixty years ago, there still remained a\r\nwell-painted, half-length portrait of bluff Harry, as a sign of the\r\nKing’s Head, before a public-house in Southwark. His personal\r\nappearance, doubtless, more than his character as a king, were at the\r\nbottom of this popular favour. He looked the personification of jollity\r\nand good cheer, and when the evil passions, expressed by his face, were\r\nlost under the clumsy brush of the sign-painter, there remained nothing\r\nbut a merry, “beery-looking” Bacchus, eminently adapted for a\r\npublic-house sign.\r\n\r\nA very respectable folio might be filled with anecdotes connected with\r\nthe various KING’S HEAD inns and taverns up and down the country and in\r\nLondon--some connected with royalty, others with remarkable persons.\r\nThus, for instance, when the Princess (afterwards Queen) Elizabeth came\r\nforth from her confinement in the Tower, November 17, 1558, she went\r\ninto the church of All Hallows, Staining, the first church she found\r\nopen, to return thanks for her deliverance from prison. As soon as this\r\npious duty was performed, the princess and her attendants went to the\r\nKing’s Head in Fenchurch Street to take some refreshment, and there her\r\nRoyal Highness dined on pork and peas. A monument of this visit is\r\nstill preserved at the above house in an engraving of the princess, from\r\na picture by Hans Holbein, hung up in the coffee-room; and the dish from\r\nwhich she ate her dinner still remains, it is said, affixed to the\r\nkitchen dresser there. There is a tradition that the bells of All\r\nHallows were rung on this occasion with such energy, that the queen\r\npresented the ringers with silken ropes.\r\n\r\nA more painful association is connected with another King’s Head:--\r\n\r\n  “In a secluded part of the Oxfordshire hills, at a place called\r\n  Collins End, situated between Hardwicke House and Goring Heath, is a\r\n  neat little rustic inn, having for its sign a well-executed portrait\r\n  of Charles I. There is a tradition that this unfortunate monarch,\r\n  while residing as a prisoner at Caversham, rode one day, attended by\r\n  an escort, into this part of the country, and hearing that there was a\r\n  bowling-green at this inn, frequented by the neighbouring gentry,\r\n  struck down to the house, and endeavoured to forget his sorrows for a\r\n  while in a game at bowls. This circumstance is alluded to in the\r\n  following lines, written beneath the signboard:--\r\n\r\n  “Stop, traveller, stop, in yonder peaceful glade,\r\n  His favourite game the royal martyr play’d.\r\n  Here, stripp’d of honours, children, freedom, rank,\r\n  Drank from the bowl, and bowl’d for what he drank;\r\n  Sought in a cheerful glass his cares to drown,\r\n  And changed his guinea ere he lost his crown.”[444]\r\n\r\nThe sign, which seems to be a copy from Vandyke, though much faded from\r\nexposure to the weather, evidently displayed an amount of artistic skill\r\nnot usually met with on the signboard; but the only information the\r\npeople of the house could give was, that they believed it to have been\r\npainted in London. His son, Charles II., is also connected in an\r\nanecdote with a King’s Head Tavern, in the Poultry, for it is reported\r\nthat he stopped at this inn on the day of his entry at the Restoration,\r\nat the request of the landlady, who happened just then to be in labour,\r\nand wished to salute his majesty. Mrs King, the lady so honoured, was\r\naunt to William Bowyer, “the learned printer of the eighteenth century.”\r\nIn Ben Jonson’s time there was a famous King’s Head Tavern in New Fish\r\nStreet, “where roysters did range.” It is this tavern, probably, that is\r\nalluded to in the ballad of “The Ranting Wh----’s Resolution:”--\r\n\r\n      “I love a young Heir\r\n      Whose fortune is fair,\r\n  And frollick in _Fish Street dinners_,\r\n  Who boldly does call,\r\n  And in private paies all,\r\n  These boyes are the noble beginners.”[445]\r\n\r\nAt the King’s Head, the corner of Chancery Lane, Cowley the poet was\r\nborn in 1618; it was then a grocer’s shop kept by his father.\r\nSubsequently it became a famous tavern, of which tokens are extant. It\r\nwas at this house that Titus Oates’s party met, and trumped up their\r\ninfamous story against the Roman Catholics, trying to implicate the Duke\r\nof York in the murder of Sir Edmundbury Godfrey. In the reign of William\r\nIII., it was a violent Whig club. The distinction adopted by the members\r\nwas a green ribbon worn in the hat. When these ribbons were shown, it\r\nwas a sign that mischief was on foot, and that there were secret\r\nmeetings to be held. North gives an amusing and lively description of\r\nthis club:--\r\n\r\n  “The house was double balconied in front, as may be yet seen, for the\r\n  clubsters to issue forth, _in fresco_, with hats and no perruques,\r\n  pipes in their mouths, merry faces and diluted throat for vocal\r\n  encouragement of the canaglia below, at bonfires, on unusual and usual\r\n  occasions.”\r\n\r\nHere the Pope-burning manifestations were got up, the Earl of\r\nShaftesbury being president. In opposition to this Green Ribbon Club,\r\nthe Tories wore in their hat a scarlet ribbon, with the words, _Rex et\r\nHaeredes_. Ned Ward, with his usual humour, describes a breakfast given\r\nin 1706 by the master of this house to his customers, consisting of an\r\nox of 415 lb., roasted whole, and at the same time embraces the\r\nopportunity of praising the landlord as “the honestest vintner in\r\nLondon, at whose house the best wine in England is to be drunk.” This\r\nwas probably Ned’s way of settling an old score.\r\n\r\nAnother King’s Head is mentioned by Pepys, 26th March 1663/4:--\r\n\r\n  “Thence walked through the ducking-pond fields, but they are so\r\n  altered since my father used to carry us to Islington, to the old\r\n  man’s at the Kings-head, to eat cakes and ale (his name was Pitts,)\r\n  that I did not know which was the ducking-pond, nor where I was.”\r\n\r\nIt was a very different “ducking” in which the landlady of the QUEEN’S\r\nHEAD ale-house was concerned, as shown by the following newspaper\r\nparagraph:--\r\n\r\n  “Last week, a woman that keeps the Queen’s Head ale-house at Kingston,\r\n  in Surrey, was ordered by the Court to be ducked for scolding, and\r\n  was accordingly placed in the chair and ducked in the river Thames,\r\n  under Kingston Bridge, in the presence of 2000 or 3000\r\n  people.”--_London Evening Post_, Ap. 27, 1745.\r\n\r\nFull particulars of such an operation are given by Misson:--\r\n\r\n  “They fasten an arm-chair to the end of two strong beams, twelve or\r\n  fifteen feet long, and parallel to each other. The chair hangs upon a\r\n  sort of axle, on which it plays freely, so as to remain in the\r\n  horizontal position. The scold being well fastened in her chair, the\r\n  two beams are then placed as near to the centre as possible, across a\r\n  post on the water side, and being lifted up behind, the chair of\r\n  course drops into the cold element. The ducking is repeated according\r\n  to the degree of shrewdness possessed by the patient, and generally\r\n  has the effect of cooling her immoderate heat, at least for a time.”\r\n\r\nAt the King’s Head, Strutton, near Ipswich, about ten years ago, there\r\nwas the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Good people, stop, and pray walk in,\r\n  Here’s foreign brandy, rum, and gin,\r\n  And, what is more, good purl and ale,\r\n  Are both sold here by old Nat Dale.”\r\n\r\nOld Nat had lived for a period of eighty years under the shadow of the\r\nKing’s Head.\r\n\r\nCombinations with the King’s Head are not very frequent. The KING’S HEAD\r\nAND LAMB, an ale-house in Upper Thames Street, is evidently a quartering\r\nof two signs. The TWO KINGS AND STILL, sign of Henry Francis in\r\nNewmarket, 1667,[446] representing a still between two kings crowned,\r\nholding their sceptres, may have originated from the distillers’ arms,\r\nthe two wild men, serving as supporters, being refined into two kings,\r\nthe garlands on their heads into crowns, and their clubs into sceptres.\r\n\r\nThat Queen Elizabeth was for more than two centuries the almost\r\nunvarying type of the QUEEN’S HEAD need not be wondered at when we\r\nconsider her well-deserved popularity. A striking instance of the\r\nveneration and esteem in which she was held, even through all the\r\ntribulations and changes of the Commonwealth, is exhibited in the fact\r\nof the bells ringing on her birthday, as late as the reign of Charles\r\nII.:--\r\n\r\n  “The Earl of Dorset coming to court, one Queen Elisabeth’s birthday,\r\n  the king [Charles II.] asked him what _the bells rung for_? which\r\n  having answered, the king farther asked him, ‘how it came to pass that\r\n  her holiday was still kept, whilst those of his father and grandfather\r\n  were no more thought of than William the Conqueror’s?’ ‘Because,’ said\r\n  the frank peer to the frank king, ’she being a woman, chose men for\r\n  her counsellors; and men, when they reign, usually chuse women.’”[447]\r\n\r\nDuring the queen’s lifetime, however, the sign-painters had to mind how\r\nthey represented “Queen Bess,” for Sir Walter Raleigh says that\r\nportraits of the queen “made by unskilful and common painters” were, by\r\nher own order, “knocked in pieces, and cast into the fire.”[448] A\r\nproclamation had been issued to that effect, in the year 1563, saying\r\nthat:--\r\n\r\n  “Forasmuch as thrugh the natural desire that all sorts of subjects and\r\n  people, both noble and mean, have to procure the portrait and picture\r\n  of the Queen’s Majestie, great nomber of Paynters, and some Printers\r\n  and Gravers have allredy, and doe daily, attempt to make in divers\r\n  manners portraictures of hir Majestie, in paynting, graving, and\r\n  pryntyng, wherein is evidently shewn, that hytherto none hath\r\n  sufficiently expressed the naturall representation of hir Majesties\r\n  person, favor, or grace, but for the most part have also erred\r\n  therein, as thereof daily complaints are made amongst hir Majesties\r\n  loving subjects, in so much, that for redress hereof hir Majestie hath\r\n  lately bene so instantly and so importunately sued by the Lords of hir\r\n  Consell, and others of hir nobility, in respect of the great disorder\r\n  herein used, not only to be content that some special coning payntor\r\n  might be permitted by access to hir Majestie to take the naturall\r\n  representation of hir Majestie, whereof she hath been allwise of hir\r\n  own right disposition very unwillyng, but also to prohibit all manner\r\n  of other persons to draw, paynt, grave, or pourtrayit hir Majesties\r\n  personage or visage for a time, until by some perfect patron and\r\n  example the same may be by others followed.\r\n\r\n  “Therfor hir Majestie, being herein as it were overcome with the\r\n  contynuall requests of so many of hir Nobility and Lords, whom she can\r\n  not well deny, is pleased that for thir contentations, some coning\r\n  persons, mete therefore, shall shortly make a pourtraict of hir person\r\n  or visage, to be participated to others, for satisfaction of hir\r\n  loving subjects; and furdermore commandeth all manner of persons in\r\n  the mean tyme to forbear from payntyng, graving, printing, or making\r\n  of any pourtraict of hir Majestie, untill some speciall person that\r\n  shall be by hir allowed, shall have first fynished a pourtraicture\r\n  thereof, after which finished, hir Majestie will be content that all\r\n  other painters, printers, or gravers that shall be known men of\r\n  understanding, and so thereto licensed by the hed officers of the\r\n  plaices where they shall dwell, (as reason it is that every person\r\n  should not without consideration attempt the same,) shall and maye at\r\n  their pleasures follow the sayd patron or first portraicture. And for\r\n  that hir Majestie perceiveth that a grete nomber of hir loving\r\n  subjects are much greved and take grete offence with the errors and\r\n  deformities allredy committed by sondry persons in this behalf, she\r\n  straightly chargeth all her officers and ministers to see to the\r\n  observation hereof, and, as soon as may be, to reform the errors\r\n  allredy committed, and in the mean tyme to forbydd and prohibit the\r\n  shewing and publication of such as are apparently deformed, until they\r\n  may be reformed which are reformable.”[449]\r\n\r\nThat there were signboards, however, representing her Majesty’s “person,\r\nfavour, and grace,” during her lifetime, is evident from the fact that\r\nan ancestor of Pennant, the London topographer, made his fortune as a\r\ngoldsmith at the sign of the QUEEN’S HEAD, in Smithfield, during the\r\nreign of good Queen Bess.\r\n\r\nThe irascible Mr Boursault, whose bile was so often deranged by\r\nsignboard irregularities, took also sycophantic exception at royal heads\r\nbeing represented in that way:\r\n\r\n  “Je souffre impatiemment que le portrait du Roy, celuy de la Reine, de\r\n  Monseigneur et des autres Princes et Princesses, servent d’enseignes\r\n  de boutiques; eux qui ne devroient faire l’ornement que des plus\r\n  célèbres galeries et des plus illustres cabinets. Monsieur d’Argenson\r\n  et Vous même, Monsieur le Commissaire, n’auriez-vous pas juste raison\r\n  de vous facher de voir vôtre portrait servir d’enseigne à, la Maison\r\n  d’un cabaretier, ou à la boutique d’un Fripier; et pourquoi donc ne\r\n  vous fachez-vous pas de ce que celui du Roy y est?”[450]\r\n\r\nOf celebrated Queen’s Heads we must begin with the highly respectable\r\ninn of that name, in which, before the reign of Queen Elizabeth, lived\r\nthe canonists and professors of spiritual and ecclesiastical law. It was\r\nsituated in Paternoster Row, where its name is still preserved in\r\nQueen’s Head Alley. From this place the lawyers removed to Doctors’\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nNearly as ancient a building was the old Queen’s Head, Lower Street,\r\nIslington, at the corner of Queen’s Head Lane, one of the most perfect\r\nspecimens of ancient domestic architecture in the vicinity of London. It\r\nis said that it was built by Sir Walter Raleigh, after he had obtained\r\n“lycense for keeping of taverns and retayling of wynes throughout\r\nEnglande,” and that it was called by him the Queen’s Head in compliment\r\nto his royal mistress. Essex is also said to have resided there, and to\r\nhave been visited by the queen. The same tradition is current about the\r\nLord Treasurer Burleigh. In the reign of George II. it was used as a\r\nplayhouse, and bills are still extant of plays acted there at that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nIt was a strong wood and plaster building, three lofty stories high,\r\nprojecting over each other, and forming bay windows supported by\r\nbrackets and caryatides. Inside it was panelled with wainscot, and had\r\nstuccoed ceilings, adorned with dolphins, cherubims, and acorns,\r\nbordered by a wreath of flowers. The porch was supported by caryatides\r\nof oak, crowned with scroll-capitals.[451] This time-honoured structure\r\nwas pulled down in October 1829, and nothing of it remains in the new\r\nbuilding erected on its site but the name, the carved oak panels of the\r\nparlour, and a bust of Queen Elizabeth at the top front. A carved\r\nmantelpiece, (formerly in the parlour of the old house,) with the\r\nhistory of Dian and Actæon on it, (a favourite subject with the virgin\r\nqueen,) was sold for more than £60 at the sale of the building\r\nmaterials, most of which were bought by antiquaries.\r\n\r\nThere used to be a large pewter tankard in this house, with an\r\ninscription engraved on it, which is much too highly spiced to be given\r\nhere. It was signed John Cranch, and bore date 1796.\r\n\r\nAt the Queen’s Head, Duke Court, Bow Street, the English language was\r\nenriched with two new terms, though one of them seems to have been\r\nstill-born. This tavern was once kept by a facetious individual of the\r\nname of Jupp. Two celebrated characters, Annesley Shay and Bob\r\nTodrington--the latter a sporting man--meeting late in the day at the\r\nabove place, went to the bar and asked for half a quartern each, with a\r\nlittle cold water. In the course of the evening they drank twenty-four,\r\nwhen Shay said to the other, “Now we’ll go.” “Oh no,” replied his\r\ncompanion, “we’ll have another, and then go.” This did not satisfy the\r\nHibernian, and they continued drinking on till three in the morning,\r\nwhen they both agreed to _go_; so that under the idea of _going_ they\r\nmade a long _stay_, and this was the origin of drinking _goes_; but\r\nanother preferring to eke out the measure his own way, used to call for\r\na quartern at a time, and these in the exercise of his humour he called\r\n_stays_.[452]\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this century, when Marylebone consisted of “green\r\nfields, babbling brooks,” and pleasant suburban retreats, there was a\r\nsmall but picturesque house of public entertainment, yclept the QUEEN’S\r\nHEAD AND ARTICHOKE, situated “in a lane nearly opposite Portland Road,\r\nand about 500 yards from the road that leads from Paddington to\r\nFinsbury”--now Albany Street. Its attractions chiefly consisted in a\r\nlong skittle and “bumble puppy” ground, shadowy bowers, and abundance of\r\ncream, tea, cakes, and other creature comforts. The only memorial now\r\nremaining of the original house is an engraving in the _Gentleman’s\r\nMagazine_, November 1819. The queen was Queen Elizabeth, and the house\r\nwas reported to have been built by one of her gardeners, whence the\r\nstrange combination on the sign.\r\n\r\nBesides Crowns (see p. 101) other royal paraphernalia are occasionally\r\nused as signboard decorations. The SCEPTRE is not uncommon; the SCEPTRE\r\nAND HEART was the sign of Samuel Grover, chirurgical instrument maker,\r\non London Bridge, in the latter end of the seventeenth century. It is\r\nengraved on his shop-bill, and represents a circle surrounded by fruit\r\nand foliage, having two Cupids standing at the upper corner, and\r\ncontaining in the centre two palm branches enclosing a sceptre\r\nsurmounted by a heart. Round the whole are suspended lancets, trepans,\r\nsaws, &c. In all probability it is simply a quartering of two signs.\r\n\r\nThe ROYAL HAND AND GLOBE was the loyal sign of a stationer at the corner\r\nof St Martin’s Lane, in 1682.[453] It doubtless refers to the royal hand\r\nholding the golden orb, surmounted by a cross. It is still the sign of\r\nan ale-house near the Soho Theatre. The same orb or globe seems to be\r\nalluded to in the sign of the SWORD AND BALL, on Holborn Bridge, in the\r\nseventeenth century. What stands in the way of this explanation,\r\nhowever, is that on the token of this house the sword is represented\r\npiercing the ball; but this may merely have been a fancy of the\r\nsign-painter, who did not understand its meaning. As for the SWORD AND\r\nMACE, the meaning is perfectly clear; it is the sign of a public-house\r\nin Coventry.\r\n\r\nThe Church is almost as abundantly represented as royalty. Even long\r\nafter the Reformation the POPE’S HEAD was still very common. Nash’s\r\n“Anatomie of Absurdities” was printed by T. Charlwood for Thomas Hacket,\r\nand was “to be sold at his shop in Lumbard Street, vnder the signe of\r\nthe Popes Heade, 1590.” Taylor, the Water poet, in his “Travels through\r\nLondon,” 1636, mentions four Pope’s Head taverns; but the most famous\r\nof all was the Pope’s Head tavern in Cornhill.\r\n\r\n  “I have read[454] of a countryman that, having lost his hood in\r\n  Westminster Hall, found the same in Cornhill hanged out to be sold,\r\n  which he challenged, but was forced to buy, or go without it, for\r\n  their stall they said was their market. At that time also the wine\r\n  drawers at the Pope’s Head tavern (standing without the door in the\r\n  High Street,)[455] took the same man by the sleeve, and said, ’Sir,\r\n  will you drink a pint of wine?’ Whereunto he answered, ‘A penny spend\r\n  I may,’ and so drank his pint, for bread nothing did he pay, for that\r\n  was allowed free.[456] This Pope’s Head tavern, with other houses\r\n  adjoining, strongly built of stone, hath of old time been all in one,\r\n  pertaining to some great estate, or rather to the king, as may be\r\n  supposed both by the largeness thereof, and by the arms, to wit, three\r\n  leopards passant gardant, which were the whole arms of England before\r\n  the reign of Edward III., that quartered them with the arms of France\r\n  three flower de lys. Some say this was King John’s house, which might\r\n  be, for I find in a written copy of ‘Matthew Paris’s History’ that in\r\n  the year 1232, Henry III. sent Hubert de Burgh, earl of Kent, to\r\n  Cornehill in London, there to answer all matters objected against\r\n  him: when he wisely acquitted himself. The Pope’s Head tavern hath a\r\n  footway through from Cornhill into Lumbard Street.”--_Stow’s Survey_,\r\n  p. 75.\r\n\r\nIn this tavern, in the fourth of Edward IV. (1464,) a trial of skill was\r\nheld between Oliver Davy, goldsmith of London, and White Johnson,\r\n“Alicante Strangeour,” also of London,--the London goldsmiths being\r\ndivided into native and “foren” workmen. These last, though they might\r\nbe Englishmen, were so named merely as a distinction with respect to the\r\nwork they produced, which consisted frequently in counterfeit articles\r\nand bad gold. The trial consisted in making, in four pieces of steel the\r\nsize of a penny, a cat’s face in relief, and another cat’s face\r\nengraved, a naked man in relief, and another engraved, which work was to\r\nbe performed in five weeks. Oliver Davy, the native goldsmith, won the\r\nwager, as White Johnson, the foreign workman, after six weeks could only\r\nproduce the two “inward engraved” objects. The forfeit was a crown, and\r\na dinner to the wardens, the umpires, and all those concerned in the\r\nwager. The works were kept in Goldsmith’s Hall, “to y^{at} intent that\r\nthey be redy iff any suche controursy herafter falls, to be shewede that\r\nsuche traverse hathe be determyn’d aforetymes.”[457] In Pepys’s time\r\nthis tavern, like many others of that period and later, had a painted\r\nroom. “18 January 1668.--To the Pope’s Head, there to see the\r\nfine-painted room which Rogerson told me of, of his doing, but I do not\r\nlike it at all, though it be good for such a publick room.” Here in 1718\r\nQuin killed his brother actor Bowen. “On Thursday s’ennight at night, Mr\r\nBowen and Mr Quin, two comedians, drinking at the Pope’s Head tavern in\r\nCornhill, quarrelled, drew their swords, and fought, and the former was\r\nrun into the guts; he languished till Sunday last, and then died. Bowen,\r\nbefore he expired, desired that Mr Quin might not be prosecuted, because\r\nwhat had happened to him was his own seeking.”[458] The jury brought in\r\na verdict of manslaughter, and Quin for the offence was burned in the\r\nhand.[459] The quarrel was rather a foolish one, arising out of a wager\r\nwhich of the two was the honester man, which had been decided in favour\r\nof Quin; _inde iræ_. This tavern seems to have continued in existence\r\ntill the latter part of the last century.\r\n\r\nThe emblem of another class of high dignitaries of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, the CARDINAL’S HAT or CAP, was at one time common in England.\r\nBagford says: “You have not meney of them, they war set up by sume that\r\nhad ben saruants to Tho. Wolsey.”[460] But we find the sign long before\r\nWolsey’s time, for in 1459, Simon Eyre\r\n\r\n  “Gave the Tavern called the Cardinal’s Hat in Lumbard Street, with a\r\n  tenement annexed on the East part of the tavern, and a mansion behind\r\n  the East tenement, together with an alley from Lumbard Street to\r\n  Cornhill, with the appurtenances, all which were by him new built,\r\n  towards a brotherhood of our Lady in St Mary Woolnots.”--_Stow_, p.\r\n  77.\r\n\r\nThis tavern and another of the same name, also in Lombard Street, were\r\nstill extant in the seventeenth century. It was also the sign of one of\r\nthe Stairs on the Bankside, the name of which is still preserved to that\r\nlocality in Cardinal Cap’s Alley.\r\n\r\n  “But at the naked stewes\r\n  I understands howe that\r\n  The sygne of the Cardinall’s hat\r\n  That inne is now shit up.”\r\n\r\n  SKELTON’S _Whye come ye not to Courte_.\r\n\r\nThese houses, by proclamation of 37, Henry VIII., were “whited and\r\npainted with signes on the front for a token of the said houses;” they\r\nwere under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Winchester, whence Pennant\r\nmakes some sly remarks upon the sign of the Cardinal’s Cap:--\r\n\r\n  “I will not give into scandal so far as to suppose that this house was\r\n  peculiarly protected by any coeval member of the sacred college.\r\n  Neither would I by any means insinuate that the Bishops of Winchester\r\n  and Rochester, or the abbots of Waverley, or of St Augustine in\r\n  Canterbury, or of Battel, or of Hyde, or the Prior of Lewis, had there\r\n  their temporary residences for them or their trains, for the sake of\r\n  these conveniences, in that period of cruel and unnatural\r\n  restriction,” &c.[461]\r\n\r\nThe BISHOP’S HEAD was, in 1663, the sign of J. Thompson, a bookseller\r\nand publisher in St Paul’s Churchyard. At this house, in 1708, was\r\npublished Hatton’s “New View of London;” it was then in the occupation\r\nof Robert Knaplock.\r\n\r\nMore general, however, was the MITRE, which was the sign of several\r\nfamous taverns in London in the seventeenth century. There was one in\r\nGreat Wood Street, Cheapside, (called on the trades token of the house\r\nthe MITRE AND ROSE,) mentioned by Pepys as “a house of the greatest\r\nnote in London.”[462] The landlord of this house, named Proctor, died at\r\nIslington of the plague in 1665, in an insolvent state, though he had\r\nbeen “the greatest vintner for some time in London for great\r\nentertainments.” There was another Mitre near the west end of St Paul’s,\r\nthe first music-house in London. The name of the master was Robert\r\nHerbert _alias_ Forges. Like many brother-publicans, he was, besides\r\nbeing a lover of music, also a collector of natural curiosities, as\r\nappears by his\r\n\r\n  “Catalogue of many natural rarities, with great industrie, cost, and\r\n  thirty years’ travel into foreign countries, collected by Robert\r\n  Herbert, alias Forges, Gent., and sworn servant to his Majesty; to be\r\n  seen at the place called the Musick house _at the Mitre_, near the\r\n  West End of S. Paul’s Church, 1664.”\r\n\r\nThis collection, or at least a great part of it, was bought by Sir Hans\r\nSloane. It is conjectured that the Mitre was situated in London House\r\nYard, at the north-west end of St Paul’s, on the spot where, afterwards,\r\nstood the house known by the sign of the GOOSE AND GRIDIRON. Ned\r\nWard[463] describes the appearance of another music-house of the same\r\nname in Wapping, which he calls “the Paradise of Wapping,” though more\r\nprobably it was in Shadwell, where there is still a Music House Court,\r\nwhich seems to point to some such origin. His description of this\r\nprototype of the Oxford and Alhambra music-halls is not a little\r\namusing. The music, consisting of fiddles, hautboys, and a humdrum\r\norgan, he compares to the grunting of a hog added as a base to a concert\r\nof caterwauling cats in the height of their ecstacy. The music-room was\r\nrichly decorated with paintings, (Hornfair was one of the pictures,)\r\ncarvings, and gilding; the seats were like pews in a church, and the\r\norchestra railed in like a chancel. The musicians occasionally went\r\nround to collect contributions, as they still do in the Cafés Chantants\r\nof the Champs Elysées, Paris. The other rooms in the house were\r\n“furnished for the entertainment of the best of companies,” all painted\r\nwith humorous subjects. The kitchen, used at that period in many taverns\r\nas a sitting room by the customers, was railed in and ornamented in the\r\nsame gaudy style as the rest of the houses; a quantity of canary birds\r\nwere suspended on the walls. Underground was a tippling sanctuary\r\npainted with drunken women tormenting the devil, and other somewhat\r\nquaint subjects. The wine of the establishment was good. Here, then, we\r\nmay imagine our great-great-grandfathers listening to the woeful fiddles\r\nscraping “Sillenger’s Round,” “John, come kiss me,” “Old Simon the\r\nKing,” or other old tunes, until flesh and blood could stand it no\r\nlonger, and a dance would be indulged in to the music of “Green\r\nSleeves,” “Yellow Stockings,” or some other equally comic dance and\r\ntune; after which everybody went home, through the dirty dark streets,\r\ndoubtless “highly pleased with the entertainment.”\r\n\r\nOlder than either of these was the Mitre in Cheap, which is mentioned in\r\nthe vestry books of St Michael’s, Cheapside, before the year 1475.[464]\r\nIn “Your Five Gallants,” a comedy by Middleton, about 1608, Goldstone\r\nprefers it to the Mermaid:--“The Mitre in my mind for neat attendance,\r\ndiligent boys and--push, excels it [the Mermaid] far.” But the most\r\nfamous of the inns with this name, was the Mitre in Mitre Court, Fleet\r\nStreet, one of Doctor Johnson’s favourite haunts, “where he loved to sit\r\nup late,”[465] and where Goldsmith, and the other celebrities, and minor\r\nstars that moved about the great doctor, used to meet him. This house is\r\nnamed in the play of “Ram Alley, or Merry Tricks,” in 1611. It was one\r\nof those houses which, for more than two centuries, was the constant\r\nresort of all the wits about town; even the name of Shakespeare throws\r\nits halo around this place:--\r\n\r\n  “Mr Thorpe, the enterprising bookseller of Bedford Street,” says Mr J.\r\n  P. Collier, “is in possession of a MS. full of songs and poems in the\r\n  handwriting of a person of the name of Richard Jackson; all prior to\r\n  the year 1631, and including many unpublished poems by a variety of\r\n  celebrated poets. One of the most curious is a song of\r\n  five-seven-lines stanzas thus headed: ’Shakespeare’s Rime which he\r\n  made at the Mytre in Fleete Street.’ It begins--‘From the rich\r\n  Lavinian shore,’ and some few of the lines were published by Playford,\r\n  and set as a catch. Another shorter piece is called in the margin:\r\n  ’Shakespeare’s Rime:’--\r\n\r\n  ‘Give me a Cup of rich Canary Wine,\r\n  Which was the Mitre’s (drink) and now is mine;\r\n  Of which had Horace and Anacreon tasted\r\n  Their lives as well as lines till now had lasted.’\r\n\r\n  I have little doubt that the lines are genuine, as well as many other\r\n  songs.”\r\n\r\nIn this same tavern Boswell supped, for the first time, with his idol,\r\nand the description of the biographer’s delight on that grand occasion\r\nhas a festive air about it that cannot fail to make a lively impression\r\non his readers:--\r\n\r\n  “He agreed to meet me in the evening at the Mitre. I called on him,\r\n  and we went thither at nine. We had a good supper, and port wine, of\r\n  which he then sometimes drank a bottle. The orthodox high church sound\r\n  of the Mitre,--the figure and manner of the celebrated Samuel\r\n  Johnson--the extraordinary power and precision of his conversation and\r\n  the pride from finding myself admitted as his companion, produced a\r\n  variety of sensations and a pleasing elevation of mind beyond what I\r\n  had ever experienced.”\r\n\r\nThere, also, that amusing scene with the young ladies from Staffordshire\r\ntook place, which would make an excellent companion picture to Leslie’s\r\n“Uncle Toby and the Widow Wadman.”\r\n\r\n  “Two young women from Staffordshire visited him when I was present to\r\n  consult him on the subject of Methodism, to which they were inclined.\r\n  Come (said he) you pretty fools, dine with Maxwell and me at the\r\n  Mitre, and we will talk over that subject, which they did; and after\r\n  dinner, he took one of them on his knees and fondled them for half an\r\n  hour together.”\r\n\r\nHogarth, too, was an occasional visitor at this tavern. A card is still\r\nextant, wherein he requested the company of Dr Arnold King to dine with\r\nhim at the _Mitre_. The written part is contained within a circle,\r\n(representing a plate) to which a knife and fork are the supporters. In\r\nthe centre is drawn a pie with a Mitre on the top of it, and the\r\ninvitation--\r\n\r\n  _Mr Hogarth’s compliments to Mr King, and desires the honour of his\r\n  company to dinner, on Thursday next, to_ η. β. π. [Eta beta py.][466]\r\n\r\nIn this tavern the Society of Antiquaries used to meet, before\r\napartments were obtained in Somerset House.\r\n\r\n  “The Society hitherto having no house of their own, meet every\r\n  Thursday evening, about seven o’clock, at the Mitre Tavern in Fleet\r\n  Street, where antiquities are produced and considered, draughts and\r\n  impressions thereof taken, dissertations read, and minutes of the\r\n  several transactions entered, and the whole economy under such\r\n  admirable regulations, that probably in a short time they may apply\r\n  for a royal power of incorporation.”[467]\r\n\r\nIn the bar of the Mitre Tavern in St James’ Market, which was kept by\r\nher aunt, (Mrs Voss, formerly the mistress of Sir Godfrey Kneller,)\r\nCaptain Farquhar overheard Miss Nancy Oldfield read the play of “The\r\nScornful Lady,” and was so struck with the proper emphasis and\r\nagreeable turn she gave to each character, that he swore the girl was\r\ncut out for the stage. Captain (afterwards Sir John) Vanbrugh, a friend\r\nof the family, recommended her to Rich, and shortly after she made her\r\n_debut_ at Covent Garden, with an allowance of fifteen shillings a week.\r\n\r\nThough a dozen other famous Mitre Taverns might be mentioned, these are\r\nsufficient to show how general a sign it was; the partiality of\r\ntavern-keepers for it is somewhat accounted for in the following stanza\r\nof the “Quack Vintners,” 1712:--\r\n\r\n  “May Smith, whose prosperous mitre is his sign,\r\n    _To shew the church no enemy to wine_;\r\n  Still draw such Christian liquor none may think,\r\n    Tho’ e’er so pious, ’tis a sin to drink.”[468]\r\n\r\nThe Mitre also is found in a few combinations, as the MITRE AND DOVE,\r\n_i.e._, the Holy Ghost, in King Street, Westminster; the MITRE AND KEYS,\r\nin Leicester--evidently the Cross Keys, which are a charge in the arms\r\nof several bishoprics; and the MITRE AND ROSE, which, from trades\r\ntokens, appears to have been the sign of a tavern in the Strand, as well\r\nas in Wood Street, Cheapside.\r\n\r\nThat the friars were also honoured on the signboard appears from “Fryar\r\nLane, on the south side of Thames Street, near Dowgate. It was formerly\r\ncalled Greenwich Lane, but of later years Fryar’s Lane, from the sign of\r\na Fryar sometime there.”[469] Probably it was a BLACK FRIAR, or\r\nDominican Monk, for that order, above all others, had the reputation of\r\nbeing great topers, and therefore were not out of place on a signboard.\r\nThere is a prayer extant of the holy fathers, addressed to St Dominic:--\r\n\r\n  “Sanctus Dominicus sit nobis semper amicus\r\n  Qui canimus nostro jugiter præconia rostro,\r\n  De cordis venis, siccatis ante lagenis;\r\n  Ergo tuas laudes si tu nos pangere gaudes,\r\n  Tempore paschali, fac ne potu puteali\r\n  Conveniat uti; quod si fit, undique muti\r\n  Semper erunt patres qui, non curant nisi fratres.”[470]\r\n\r\nAnd an old French couplet gives the following gradations of the potatory\r\ncapacities of the different orders, in which the Franciscans only are\r\nsaid to beat the Dominicans:--\r\n\r\n  “Boire à la Capucine,\r\n  C’est boire pauvrement;\r\n  Boire à la Célestine,\r\n  C’est boire largement;\r\n  Boire à la Jacobine,\r\n  C’est chopine à chopine;\r\n  Mais boire en Cordelier,\r\n  C’est vider le cellier.”[471]\r\n\r\nTokens are extant of a music-house, with the sign of the Black-friar,\r\ndated 1671. In Paris also, the Bacchic propensities of the Black-friars\r\nmade a tavern-keeper of the seventeenth century choose ST DOMINIC as the\r\npatron saint of his tavern. His principal customers, who formed a sort\r\nof club, were called Dominicans; a contemporary song thus gives the rule\r\nof this order:--\r\n\r\n  “Nous sommes dix, tous grands buveurs;\r\n  Bons ivrognes et grands fumeurs,\r\n  Qui ne cessant jamais de boire,\r\n  Et de remuer la machoire,\r\n  Méprisons d’amour les faveurs.”[472]\r\n\r\nNuns also figured on the signboard as the THREE NUNS, which was\r\nconstantly used by drapers; not exactly, as Tom Brown says, “very\r\ndismally painted to keep up young women’s antipathy to popery and”\r\nsingle blessedness, but because the holy sisterhoods were generally very\r\nexpert in making lace embroidery, and other fancy work--as the\r\nhandkerchiefs made by the nuns of Pau, and sold by our drapers, fully\r\nprove even at the present day. In the seventeenth century, the _Three\r\nNuns_ was the sign of a well-known coaching and carriers’ inn in\r\nAldgate, which gave its name to Three Nuns’ Court close at hand; near\r\nthis inn was the “dreadful gulf, for such it was rather than a pit,” in\r\nwhich, during the Plague of 1665, not less than 1114 bodies were buried\r\nin a fortnight, from the 6th to the 20th of September.[473] Not\r\nimprobably this sign, after the Reformation, was occasionally\r\nmetamorphosed into the THREE WIDOWS: Peter Treveris, a foreigner,\r\nerected a press and continued printing until 1552 at the THREE WIDOWS in\r\nSouthwark; he printed several books for William Rastell, John Reynor, R.\r\nCopeland, and others in the city of London. It is still the sign of a\r\ncap and bonnet shop in Dublin. The MATRONS, also, may have originally\r\nrepresented Nuns; this last hung, in the seventeenth century, at the\r\ndoor of John Bannister, crutch and bandage maker, near the hospital,\r\n(Christ’s Hospital School,) Newgate Street.[474]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.\r\n\r\nMERCURY AND FAN.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1810.)\r\n\r\nNOBODY.\r\n\r\n(From an old print, circa 1600.)\r\n\r\nRUNNING FOOTMAN.\r\n\r\n(Charles Street, Berkeley Square, circa 1790.)\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection.)]\r\n\r\nAt the present day the CHURCH is a very common ale-house sign, either on\r\naccount of the esteem in which good living has been held by churchmen in\r\nall ages, “superbis pontificum potiore cœnis,” or, from the proximity of\r\na church to the ale-house in question; thus, one inn in the town would\r\nbe known as the “Market House,” whilst another might be known as the\r\n“Church Inn.” It has been said the name was given that topers might\r\nequivocate and say that they “frequently go to church.” Be this as it\r\nmay, there is generally an ale-house close to every church, (in\r\nKnightsbridge the chapel of the Holy Trinity is jammed in between two\r\npublic-houses,) whereby a good opportunity is offered to wash a dry\r\nsermon down. In Bristol, at the beginning of the present century, it was\r\nstill worse--a Methodist meeting-room was immediately over a\r\npublic-house, which gave rise to the following epigram:--\r\n\r\n  “There’s a spirit above and a spirit below,\r\n  A spirit of joy and a spirit of woe--\r\n  The spirit above is the spirit divine;\r\n  But the spirit below is the spirit of wine.”\r\n\r\nOther signs connected with the church are the CHAPEL BELL, at Suton, in\r\nNorfolk, and the CHURCH STILE or CHURCH GATES, which is very common. The\r\norigin of this last comes from an old custom of drinking ale on the\r\nparish account, on certain occasions, at the church stile. Pepys\r\nmentions this when he was at Walthamstow, April 14, 1661:--“After dinner\r\nwe all went to the church stile, and there eat and drank.” To this a\r\ncorrespondent in the _Gent. Mag._ (Nov. 1852, p. 442) makes the\r\nfollowing note:--“In an old book of accounts belonging to Warrington\r\nparish, the following minute occurs:--“Nov. 5, 1688. Paid for drink at\r\nthe church steele, 13s.;” and in 1732, “It is ordered that hereafter no\r\nmoney be spent on ye 5th of November or any other State day on the\r\nparish account, either at the church stile or any other place.” Though\r\ncertainly the parish now does not pay for any ale drunk at the church\r\nstile, the sign is evidently set up in remembrance of the good old time\r\nwhen such things were.\r\n\r\nBelonging to the church was also the sign of the THREE BRUSHES, or Holy\r\nWater Sprinklers, which was that of an old house near the White Lion\r\nprison, Southwark, in which there was a room with panelled wainscoting\r\nand ceiling ornamented with the royal arms of Queen Elizabeth. Probably\r\nit had been the court-room at the time the White Lion Inn was a prison.\r\nAmongst the Beaufoy trades tokens there is one of “Rob. Thornton,\r\nhaberdasher, next the Three Brushes in Southwark, 1667.”\r\n\r\nInnumerable signs were borrowed from the army and navy; thus, at the\r\npresent day, every uniform in the service is represented near barracks\r\nor in other haunts of soldiers. The RECRUITING SERGEANT is generally the\r\nsign of the public-house, where that worthy spreads his nets. CROSS\r\nGUNS, CROSS LANCES, CROSS SWORDS, and CROSS PISTOLS, respectively, are\r\nmeant to allure artillerymen, lancers, and various cavalry men. But\r\nabove all the STANDARD, the BANNER, or the WAVING FLAG--“the glorious\r\nrag that for a thousand years has stood the battle and the breeze,” is\r\nof common occurrence, not only in the neighbourhood of military\r\nquarters, but everywhere in towns and villages. At the Standard Tavern\r\nin the Strand, Edmund Curll the bookseller used to meet the mysterious\r\nRev. Mr Smith, who sold him Pope’s correspondence.\r\n\r\n  “I am just going to the Lords to finish Pope,” writes Curll to this\r\n  person. “I desire you to send me the sheets to perfect the first fifty\r\n  books, and likewise the remaining three hundred books, and pray be at\r\n  the Standard Tavern this evening and I will pay you £20 more.”\r\n\r\nThe KETTLEDRUM is a sign at St George-in-the-East; the DRUM and the\r\nTRUMPET are both of frequent occurrence, and the last is of old\r\nstanding. One of the characters in “The Ball,” a play by Shirley, 1633,\r\nthus commends the beer of the Trumpet:--\r\n\r\n  “Their strong beere is better than any I\r\n  Ever drunke at the Trumpet.”--_The Ball_, Act v.\r\n\r\nPossibly this was the Trumpet in Shire Lane, immortalised in the\r\n_Tatler_, and one of the favourite haunts of merry good-natured Dick\r\nSteele. Bishop Hoadley was once present at one of the meetings in this\r\ntavern, when Steele rather exposed himself in his efforts to please, a\r\ndouble duty devolving upon him, as well to celebrate the “glorious\r\nmemory” of King William III., it being the 4th of November--as to drink\r\nup to conversation pitch his friend Addison, the phlegmatic constitution\r\nof whom was hardly warmed for society by the time Steele was no longer\r\nfit for it. One of the company, a red hot Whig, knelt down to drink the\r\nhealth with all honours. This rather disconcerted the bishop, which,\r\nSteele seeing, whispered to him--“Do laugh, my lord, pray laugh; it is\r\nhumanity to laugh.” Shortly after Steele was put into a chair and sent\r\nhome. Next morning he was much ashamed, and sent the Bishop this\r\ndistich:--\r\n\r\n  “Virtue with so much ease on Bangor sits,\r\n  All faults he pardons though he none commits.”\r\n\r\nSome trades tokens are extant of houses with the sign of the Trumpet in\r\nKing Street, Wapping, and in the Minories. At the same period there was\r\na sign of the TRUMPETER in Trump Alley, probably suggested by the name\r\nof the thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nThe BUCKLER is a very old sign, and occurs in “Cocke Lorell’s Bote:”--\r\n\r\n  “Here is Saunder Sadeler of Froge Street Corner, With Jelyan Joly at\r\n  signe of the _Bokeler_.”\r\n\r\nMore general was the sign of the SWORD AND BUCKLER, which was frequently\r\nset up by haberdashers for the following reason:--\r\n\r\n  “And whereas, until about the twelve or thirteenth yeere of Queene\r\n  Elisabeth, the auncient English fight of sword and buckler was only\r\n  had in use, the bucklers then being only a foot broad, with a pike of\r\n  four or five inches long; then they beganne to make them full half ell\r\n  broad, with sharpe pikes 10 or 12 inches long, wherewith they meant\r\n  either to breake the swordes of their enemies, if it hitte uppon the\r\n  pike, or else sodainely to runne within them and stabbe, and thrust\r\n  their buckler with the pike into the face, arme, and body of their\r\n  adversary, but this continued not long;[475] _every haberdasher then\r\n  sold bucklers”_.--_Stow’s Chronicle._\r\n\r\nThe great prevalence of this sign originated in the so-called sword and\r\nbuckler _play_, once so common in England. Misson, who visited this\r\ncountry in the beginning of the eighteenth century, says:--\r\n\r\n  “Within these few years you should often see a sort of gladiators\r\n  marching through the streets, in their shirts to the waste, their\r\n  sleeves tucked up, sword in hand, and preceeded by a drum to gather\r\n  spectators. They give so much a head to see the fight, which was with\r\n  cutting swords and a kind of buckler for defence. The edge of the\r\n  sword was a little blunted, and the care of the prize fighters was not\r\n  so much to avoid wounding one another, as to avoid doing it\r\n  dangerously; nevertheless as they were obliged to fight till some\r\n  blood was shed, without which nobody would give a farthing for the\r\n  show, they were sometimes forced to play a little roughly. The fights\r\n  are become very rare within these eight or ten years.”[476]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century it was not a _little_ rough play, which is\r\nevident from those matches at which Pepys was present, and which he\r\ndescribes at large. Jouvin, another Frenchman who visited England in\r\n1672, gives a detailed account of these _divertisements_, which, at that\r\nperiod, at all events, were anything but play; and Maitland was right\r\nwhen he designated them as “a barbarous performance, by those whom\r\nnecessity (occasioned by a scandalous laziness and indolence) induces to\r\nexpose themselves to be horribly mangled for a little money, while the\r\nbloodily-minded spectators satiate themselves with human gore to the\r\ngreat reproach of religion.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Spectator_, No. 436, there is an amusing essay on those\r\n“Hockley-in-the-Hole Gladiators,” and in No. 449 a letter appears, in\r\nwhich the deceits of the champions are shown:--\r\n\r\n  “I overheard two masters of the science agreeing to quarrel on the\r\n  next opportunity. This was to happen in the company of a set of the\r\n  fraternity of the basket hilts who were to meet that evening. When\r\n  this was settled, one asked the other: ‘Will you give cuts or\r\n  receive?’ The other answered, ‘Receive.’ It was replied, ‘Are you a\r\n  passionate man?’ ‘No, provided you cut no more, nor no deeper than we\r\n  agree.’”\r\n\r\nA few other instances of the Sword occur on signs, as the SWORD AND\r\nCROSS, a sort of emblem of the Church militant, or perhaps an inversion\r\nof the CROSS SWORDS: this was a sign “next door to the Savoy Gate in\r\n1711.” The SWORDBLADE, a coffee-house in Birchen Lane in 1718, and the\r\nSWORD AND DAGGER, a combination of arms that evokes the phantom of many\r\na desperate duel amongst the ruffling gallants of the reign of James I.\r\nThis sign of ill omen was, in the seventeenth century, in St Catherine\r\nLane, Tower, as appears from the traded tokens issued there.\r\n\r\nThe DAGGER was once common in London--\r\n\r\n  “My lawyer’s clerk I lighted on last night\r\n  In Holborn at the _Dagger_,”\r\n\r\nsays Captain Face, in Ben Jonson’s “Alchymist,” and various trades\r\ntokens testify the prevalence of the sign. Probably this arose from its\r\nbeing a charge in the city arms, which was supposed to represent the\r\ndagger Sir William Walworth used in slaying Wat Tyler. This at least was\r\nasserted in the inscription below the niche in which Sir William’s\r\nstatue was erected in Fishmonger’s Hall:--\r\n\r\n  “Brave Walworth knyght Lord Mayor yt slew\r\n  Rebellious Tyler in his alarmes--\r\n  The king therefore did give in lieu\r\n  The Dagger to the Cytyes armes.”\r\n\r\nStow says that this is erroneous, as, when in the 4 Richard II. a new\r\nseal was made for the city, “the armes of this city were not altered,\r\nbut remayne as afore; to witte, argent, a playne cross gules a _sword of\r\nSaint Paul_ in the first quarter and no dagger of William Walworth as is\r\nfabuled.”[477] The DAGGER AND PIE was in the seventeenth century the\r\nsign of a celebrated pie-shop in Cheapside, the Pie being added to the\r\noriginal sign; but from the trades tokens of this house we see that this\r\nwas represented by a rebus of a dagger with a magpie on the point.\r\nDagger-pies are frequently mentioned in the plays of that period; for\r\ninstance, in Decker’s “Satyro-Mastrix:”--“I’ll not take thy word for a\r\ndagger-pie;” and in Prynne’s “Histrio-Mastrix,” “and please you, let\r\nthem be dagger-pies.” The London apprentices appear to have been good\r\ncustomers to this house. Whenever, for example, old Hobson, the merry\r\nhaberdasher, went abroad, “his prentices wold ether bee at the Taverne\r\nfilling their heds with wine or at the Dagger in Cheapside cramming\r\ntheir bellies with minced pyes.”[478] And in Heywood’s comedy of “If you\r\nKnow not me you Know Nobody,” the worthy citizen bitterly inveighs\r\nagainst the temptations held out to apprentices by the dainties of this\r\nhouse:--\r\n\r\n  “Ten pounds a morning! Here is the fruit\r\n  Of Dagger-pies and Ale-house guzzling.”--Act i. sc. i., 1606.\r\n\r\nA rather curious sign was that of the RED M AND DAGGER. The letter M was\r\nthe initial of Mrs Milner’s name, who, at this sign in Pope’s Head\r\nAlley, “over against the Royal Exchange in Cornhill,” sold the “Grand\r\nRestorative,” which cured consumption, stone, dropsy, and all evils\r\nflesh is heir to. The sign occurs among the Bagford bills; there is a\r\nsimilar one amongst the Banks bills, the PISTOL AND C, the sign of John\r\nCrook, a razor-maker at the Great Turnstile, Holborn, _circa_ 1787: the\r\nbill represents a renaissance scutcheon with a pistol, above it a C, and\r\nsurgical instruments disseminated on the field.\r\n\r\nThough we have the authority of Cicero that _cedant arma togæ_, yet\r\nbooksellers, who flourish by the arts of peace, choose the HELMET for\r\ntheir sign. Humphrey Joy, a bookseller and printer in St Paul’s\r\nChurchyard in 1550, and another, celebrated in the reigns of Henry\r\nVIII., Edward VI., and Queen Mary, Rowland Hall by name, had both a\r\nHELMET for their sign. This Hall changed his sign more frequently than\r\nis generally the custom; thus, besides the Helmet, he is known to have\r\ntraded at the signs of the CRADLE, in Lombard Street; the HALF EAGLE AND\r\nKEY, in Gutter Lane; and the THREE ARROWS, in Golden Lane, near\r\nCripplegate. There is still a stone carving of the helmet fixed in the\r\nfront of a house in London Wall, with the date 1668 and the initials\r\nH. M. Ned Ward mentions the Helmet in Bishopsgate; he says at the\r\nbattles without bloodshed of the Trainbands in Moorfields, the gallant\r\nwarriors wish\r\n\r\n  “For beer from the Helmet in Bishopsgate.\r\n  And why from the Helmet? Because that sign\r\n  Makes the liquor as welcome t’ a soldier as wine.”\r\n\r\nTrades tokens are extant of the BLUE HELMET in Tower Street. From the\r\nsame source we learn that there was, in the seventeenth century, a sign\r\nof the PLATE, _i.e._, the Breastplate, in Upper Shadwell; and a HANDGUN\r\nin Shadwell. This weapon was a sort of musket of early times, fired in\r\nthe hand without a rest; “gunners with handguns or half-hakes” are named\r\nby Stow in his enumeration of the troops marching in the city watch on\r\nSt John’s night.\r\n\r\nA few other old weapons remain to be mentioned, as the ARROW, once a\r\ngreat favourite when this weapon made the English name terrible whenever\r\nour troops took the field. In the last century there was a beer-house at\r\nKnockholt, in Kent, the sign an Arrow, with the following poetical\r\neffusion beneath:--\r\n\r\n  “Charles Collins liveth here,\r\n  Sells rum, brandy, gin, and beer;\r\n  I make this board a little wider,\r\n  To let you know I sell good cyder.”\r\n\r\nThe CROSS-BULLETS, a name puzzling at first sight, was a sign in Thames\r\nStreet in the seventeenth century, representing two bar-shot crossed,\r\nwhich the trades token elucidates by the equally puzzling legend, “at\r\nthe Crose bvlets;” this was an instrument of destruction formerly used\r\nin naval engagements, and for that reason set up in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe shipping.\r\n\r\nIf we may believe a jocular article on a quack handbill in the\r\n_Spectator_, No. 444, there was a CANNON-BALL in Drury Lane; for he\r\nmentions that--\r\n\r\n  “In Russell Court, over against the Canonball, at the Surgeons’ Arms,\r\n  in Drury Lane, is lately come from his travels a surgeon who has\r\n  practised surgery and physic both by sea and land these twenty-four\r\n  years. He (by the blessing) cures the Yellow Jaundice, Green sickness,\r\n  Scurvey, Dropsy, Surfeits, Long sea voyages, Campaigns, and women’s\r\n  miscarriages, lyings in, etc., as some people that has been lamed\r\n  these thirty years can testify; in short he cureth all diseases\r\n  incident on man, women, or children.”\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly this bill had been slightly touched up in passing through\r\nthe hands of the _Spectator_, who, like the mythological king,\r\n“_quodcunque tetigit inaurat_,” for it is rather “too good to be true.”\r\n\r\nThe HALBERT AND CROWN was, in 1791, the sign of Paul Savigne, a cutler\r\nin St Martin’s Churchyard; whilst the SPEAR IN HAND is at the present\r\nday the sign of a public-house at Norwich, being undoubtedly a popular\r\nversion of some family crest.\r\n\r\nIn Jews’ Row, or Royal Hospital Row, Chelsea, there is a sign which\r\ngreatly mystifies the maimed old heroes of the Peninsula and Waterloo,\r\nand many others besides; this is the SNOW-SHOES. It is the sign of a\r\nhouse of old standing, and was set up during the excitement of the\r\nAmerican war of independence, when snow-shoes formed part of the\r\nequipment of the troops sent out to fight the battles of King George\r\nagainst “Mr Washington and his rebels.”\r\n\r\nOne of the low public-houses that stood on the outskirts of London,\r\ntowards Hyde Park Corner, at the end of the last century, was called the\r\nTRIUMPHAL CAR. There were a great many other houses of the same\r\ndescription in that neighbourhood, viz., the Hercules Pillars, the Red\r\nLion, the Swan, the Golden Lion, the Horse-shoe, the Running Horse, the\r\nBarleymow, the White Horse, and the Half-moon, which two last have given\r\nnames to two streets in Piccadilly. The sign of the Triumphal Car was\r\nin all probability bestowed upon the house in honour of the soldiers who\r\nused to visit it.\r\n\r\n  “These public-houses, about the middle of last century, were much\r\n  visited on Sundays, but those contiguous to Hyde Park were chiefly\r\n  resorted to by soldiers, particularly on review days, when there were\r\n  long wooden seats fixed in the street before the houses for the\r\n  accommodation of six or seven barbers, who were employed on field days\r\n  in powdering those youths who were not adroit enough to dress each\r\n  other’s hair. Yet it was not unusual for twenty or thirty of the older\r\n  soldiers to bestride a form in the open air, where each combed,\r\n  soaped, powdered, and tied the hair of his comrade, and afterwards\r\n  underwent the same operation himself.”[479]\r\n\r\nThe grenadiers of Frederick the Great managed those things still better,\r\nfor twenty or thirty of them used to sit in a circle, each dressing,\r\nplaiting, and powdering the pigtail of the man before him, so that all\r\nhands were employed at the same time, and none was lost in waiting.\r\nThere is still a Triumphant Chariot public-house in Pembroke Mews,\r\nChelsea, a house of more than fifty years’ standing.\r\n\r\nThe BOMBAY GRAB in High Street, Bow, belongs to military signs, as\r\n“Grab,” or “Crab,” is a slang expression for a foot soldier; perhaps the\r\nlandlord at one time may have been in the Bombay army.\r\n\r\nObjects relating to the navy, or rather to shipping, are still more\r\ncommon in this seafaring nation of ours than the attributes or emblems\r\nof any other trade or profession. Ned Ward describes Deptford in 1703 as\r\nevery house being distinguished by either the sign of the Ship, the\r\nAnchor, the Three Mariners, Boatswain and Call, or something relating to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n  “For as I suppose [says he] if they should hang up any other, the\r\n  salt-water novices would be as much puzzled to know what the figure\r\n  represented as the Irishman was, when he called the Globe the Golden\r\n  Cabbage, and the Unicorn the White Horse with a barber’s pole in his\r\n  forehead.”[480]\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a town in the kingdom that has not a SHIP inn, tavern,\r\nor public-house. Tokens exist of “the Ship without Templebar, 1649,”\r\nprobably the inn granted in 1571 to Sir Christopher Hatton, along with\r\nsome lands in Yorkshire and Dorsetshire, and the wardship of a\r\nminor.[481] William Faithorne the engraver (ob. 1691) seems to have\r\noccupied the same house afterwards, for Walpole informs us that--\r\n\r\n  “Faithorne now set up in a new shop at the sign of the SHIP, next to\r\n  the DRAKE, opposite to the Palsgrave Head, without Temple Bar, where\r\n  he not only followed his art, but sold Italian, Dutch, and English\r\n  prints, and worked for booksellers.”[482]\r\n\r\nThis sign of the _Ship_, next to the _Drake_, seems to have constituted\r\na sort of a pun or a rebus on Admiral Drake, as observed by Mr Akerman.\r\nAmong the trades tokens there was “Will Jonson at y^{e} DRAKE, Bell\r\nYard, Temple Bar, 1667.” The _Drake_ stood next to the _Ship_. It was\r\ndoubtless a rebus, and alluded to the Admiral, who was very popular in\r\nthe reign of Queen Elizabeth, the mint-mark of the martlet on her coins\r\nbeing termed by the vulgar a Drake. The situation of this sign near the\r\nShip was appropriate enough. In the seventeenth century there was a sign\r\nof the Ship at Leeuwarden, in Friesland, (Netherlands,) with the\r\nfollowing inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Die in de ly, my vaart voorby\r\n  Zal hebben een Ryxdaalder en ’t gelach vry.”[483]\r\n\r\nAt the Ship tavern in the Old Bailey, kept by Mr Thomas Amps, on Tuesday\r\nthe 14th of February 1654, a plot against Cromwell was discovered.\r\nCarlyle[484] forcibly pictures the conspirators as eleven truculent,\r\nrather threadbare persons, sitting over small drink there on that\r\nTuesday night, considering how the Protector might be assassinated. Poor\r\nbroken Royalist men, payless old captains, and such like, with their\r\nsteeple hats worn very brown, and jackboots slit, projecting there what\r\nthey could not execute. The poor knaves were found guilty, but not worth\r\nhanging, and got off with being sent to the Tower for a while to ponder\r\nover their wickedness.\r\n\r\nNames of famous men-of-war are often found on the signboard, in\r\nseaports; either in honour of some brilliant feat performed by them, or\r\nsimply in compliment to the crew, in the hopes of obtaining their\r\nliberal patronage. Thus the ALBION, the SAUCY AJAX, the CIRCE, and\r\nARETHUSA, with innumerable others, may be met with in the vicinity of\r\nPlymouth, Portsmouth, and other seaports. The naming of signboards in\r\nthis way was an old custom; as two examples among the London trades\r\ntokens very sufficiently prove. Thus, for instance, THE SPEAKER’S\r\nFRIGATE, the sign of a shop in Shadwell in the seventeenth century. The\r\nfrigate had been named after Sir Richard Stainer, speaker in the House\r\nof Commons in the time of the Commonwealth, who had done good service\r\nunder command of Admiral Blake, in some of the naval engagements with\r\nthe Spaniards. In 1652, this ship was sent to “Argier in Turkey,”\r\n(Algiers,) under command of Captain Thorowgood, with the sum of £30,000\r\nto redeem English captives from slavery. Upon this occasion the Puritan\r\nnewspapers made the following punning prayer:--\r\n\r\n  “A prosperous gale attend his motion; and a Christian vote and\r\n  blessing be present, in all their debates and consultations, for\r\n  doubtless, ’tis a sacrifice pleasing both to God and man, and plainly\r\n  denotes unto the people of England, that our magistrates had rather\r\n  bring home exiles, than make more.”[485]\r\n\r\nAfter the Restoration the name of this ship was changed into the ROYAL\r\nCHARLES, (which also occurs as a sign,) that ill-fated ship taken by the\r\nDutch in 1667, when, under Admiral de Ruyter, they made their descent on\r\nChatham and Sheerness, and burnt a part of our fleet. The Royal Charles\r\nwas one of the ships they took away. Its stern is still kept as a trophy\r\nin Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nShips occur in various conditions, as the FULL SHIP, Hull; SHIP IN DOCK,\r\nDartmouth; and the SHIP ON LAUNCH, in every ship-building locality. The\r\nSHIP IN FULL SAIL was the sign of the first shop of Murray the\r\npublisher, in Fleet Street--probably in opposition to Longman, who had\r\nthe SHIP AT ANCHOR. THE SHIP IN DISTRESS is a touching appeal to the\r\ngood-natured wayfarer to assist in keeping the pump going. At Brighton,\r\nthere was such a sign in the last century, on which the poet had\r\nassisted the painter to invoke the sympathy of the thirsty public:--\r\n\r\n  “With sorrows I am compass’d round,\r\n  Pray lend a hand, my ship’s aground.”\r\n\r\nThe Ship is to be met with in innumerable combinations: the SHIP AND\r\nPILOT BOAT, Narrow Quay, Bristol; the SHIP AND ANCHOR is not uncommon,\r\nand in one place, at Chipping Norton, it is quaintly corrupted into the\r\nSHEEP AND ANCHOR;[486] the SHIP AND WHALE, in compliment to the\r\nGreenland Fishery, occurs at South Shields, and the SHIP AND NOTCHBLOCK\r\nis a sailor’s coffee-house in the Ratcliff Highway. All these explain\r\nthemselves; most of the other combinations seem to result from the\r\nquartering of two signs, as the SHIP AND BELL, Horn Dean, Hants; the\r\nSHIP AND FOX, “next door but one to the FIVE BELLS tavern, near the\r\nMaypole in the Strand,” in 1711; the SHIP AND STAR on a trades token of\r\nCornhill, may be the north star by which ancient mariners used to\r\nnavigate; the SHIP AND RAINBOW is common to many places; the SHIP AND\r\nSHOVEL, Tooley Street; said to be a deterioration of the Sir Cloudesley\r\nShovel, but more likely alluding to the _shovels_ used in taking out\r\nballast, coal, corn, (when in bulk) and various other cargoes; the SHIP\r\nAND PLOUGH, Hull; the SHIP AND BLUE COAT BOY, Walworth Road, although\r\nsusceptible of explanations, are doubtless only but quarterings. The\r\nSHIP AND CASTLE, though of common occurrence, seemed to puzzle the\r\npublic already in the seventeenth century:--\r\n\r\n  “What resemblance the Ship and the Castle may bear\r\n  To ships floating on clouds, or to castles in air,\r\n  We know not; but this we are sure of, ’tis plain\r\n  Their clarets are perfectly Leger-de-Main.”\r\n\r\n  _Search after Claret_, 1691, canto I.\r\n\r\nIf not a combination of two signs, it may have some reference to our\r\nnational defences. It was a sign in Cornhill as early as 1716, when, on\r\nNovember 9, the newspapers conveyed the following information to the\r\nmetropolis:--\r\n\r\n  “We are informed that this day a fowl was roasted in a wonderful\r\n  sun-kitchen on the top of the Ship and Castle tavern, Cornhill, in\r\n  view of many gentlemen. The artist performer, who is a gentleman newly\r\n  come from France, proposes to roast and boil meat, bake bread, prepare\r\n  tea and coffee, and all kitchenwork done without common fire; some\r\n  particular thing to be seen every day that the sun shines out\r\n  brightly. ’Twas observable that when the fowl was dressed, it had the\r\n  same taste and smell as if done by a common fire. The machine is\r\n  composed of about a hundred small looking or convex-glasses.”\r\n\r\nThe scheme, seemingly, did not succeed in dethroning “old king coal,”\r\nfor if we had to depend on the sun for our cookery, it is to be feared\r\nwe would often have cold cheer.\r\n\r\nAmongst all these ships, of course, Jack tar could not be forgot. The\r\nSHIP FRIENDS occur in Sunderland; the THREE MARINERS is an old sign, of\r\nwhich there are examples among the trades tokens, and which is still to\r\nbe seen on two or three public-houses in London. There was formerly a\r\ntavern known by this sign in Vauxhall.\r\n\r\n  “On repairing it in 1752, in it was found a remarkably high-elbowed\r\n  chair covered with purple cloth, and ornamented with gilt nails. An\r\n  old fisherman told Mr Buckmaster that he had heard his grandfather\r\n  say, that King Charles II. disguised, used on his water tours with his\r\n  ladies to frequent the above tavern to play at chess, &c., and that\r\n  the chair found, was the same as the king sat in. The chair was\r\n  repaired and kept as a curiosity by the late John Dawson, Esq., but by\r\n  neglect was, at the pulling down of his old dwelling at Vauxhall in\r\n  1777, destroyed. Mr Buckmaster sat in the chair many times, but his\r\n  feet would not touch the ground. King Charles was very tall. No tavern\r\n  of this name is known to exist now in Lambeth, but there is one of the\r\n  sign of the THREE MERRY BOYS,[487] probably a corruption of the above\r\n  name.”[488]\r\n\r\nIn other places we meet with the THREE JOLLY SAILORS; at Castleford\r\nthere used to be one representing the jolly sailors “with a sheet in the\r\nwind,” and under it the following professional invitation:--\r\n\r\n  “Coil up your ropes and anchor here,\r\n  Till better weather does appear.”\r\n\r\nIn North Street, Hull, there is a sign of JACK ON A CRUISE, not on board\r\nH.M. ship, but “out on” what the lands folk call “a spree;” the cruises,\r\nhowever, are generally confined to rather low latitudes. The BOATSWAIN\r\nappears to have been a public-house in Wapping in the reign of Charles\r\nII., for Wycherly in the “Plain Dealer,” 1676, makes Jerry Blackaire\r\nsay:--“I should soon be picking up all our own mortgaged apostle spoons,\r\nbowls, and beakers, out of most of the ale-houses betwixt Hercules\r\nPillars and the _Boatswain_ in Wapping.” The BOATSWAIN’S CALL is a\r\npublic-house sign in Frederick Street, Portsea, whose invitation the\r\nsailors, no doubt, accept with much more pleasure than the boatswain’s\r\ncall of “all hands on deck” on a frosty winter morning. It was the name\r\nof a patriotic sea song during one of the wars with France. RED, WHITE,\r\nAND BLUE, and its synonyme, the THREE ADMIRALS, both occur in more than\r\none instance in Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThe ANCHOR was, perhaps, set up rather as an emblem than as referring to\r\nits use in shipping. It is frequently represented in the catacombs,\r\ntypifying the words of St Paul, who calls hope “the anchor of the soul,\r\nboth sure and steadfast.” St Ambrose says, “it is this which keeps the\r\nChristian from being carried away by the storm of life.” Other early\r\nwriters use it as a symbol of true faith, and one of them has this\r\nbeautiful idea:--\r\n\r\n  “As an anchor cast into the sand will keep the ship in safety, even so\r\n  hope, ever amidst poverty and tribulation, remains firm, and is\r\n  sufficient to sustain the soul; though, in the eyes of the world, it\r\n  may seem but a weak and frail support.”[489]\r\n\r\nIt was a favourite sign with the early printers, probably in imitation\r\nof Aldus.[490] Thus Thomas Vautrollier, a scholar and printer from Paris\r\nand Rouen, who came to England about the beginning of Queen Elizabeth’s\r\nreign, and established his printing-office in Blackfriars, had an anchor\r\nfor his sign, with the motto, “_Anchora Spei_.” At West Bromwich there\r\nis an ale-house having the sign of the Anchor with the following\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\n  “O sweet ale, how sweet art thou,\r\n  Thy chearing streams new life impart,\r\n  Esteemed by all extremely good,\r\n  To quench our thirst and do us good.”\r\n\r\nSometimes a female figure in flowing garments is represented holding the\r\nanchor, in which case it is called the HOPE AND ANCHOR. The BLUE ANCHOR\r\nwas painted of that colour as a “difference” from other anchors; it is a\r\ncommon sign; it was the trade emblem of Henry Herringman, of the “New\r\nExchange,” the principal London bookseller and publisher in the reign of\r\nKing Charles II., the friend of Davenant, Dryden, and Cowley. The BLUE\r\nANCHOR AND BALL was the sign of a mercer’s shop near the Conduit in\r\nCheapside in 1707, the ball being the usual addition to intimate the\r\nsale of silks. Other distinctions are the SHEET ANCHOR, at Whitmore, in\r\nStaffordshire; the FOUL ANCHOR, a sign of two public-houses at Wisbeach,\r\nimplying, no doubt, that the lotus-eaters, who anchor in that harbour,\r\nget so entangled in the luxurious weeds of pleasure, that it becomes\r\nimpossible for them to leave; the RAFFLED ANCHOR, Swan’s Quay, North\r\nShields; and the ROPE AND ANCHOR, which is very common, the anchor being\r\ngenerally represented with a piece of cable twined round the stem.\r\n\r\nA few combinations also occur: the ANCHOR AND CAN, at Ross, and at\r\nPutson, Hereford, which seems to allude to the Anchor as a measure; the\r\nANCHOR AND SHUTTLE, Luttendenfoot, Warley, Manchester, the shuttle being\r\nadded in compliment to the weavers; the ANCHOR AND CASTLE, a quartering\r\nof two signs in Tooley Street, &c.\r\n\r\nSometimes instead of the ship, some peculiar vessel is chosen, as, for\r\ninstance, the SLOOP, or the LEIGH HOY, a sort of smack, which occurs\r\namongst the trades tokens as a sign near St Catherine’s Docks, and is\r\nstill to be seen in Church Street, Mile End; the COBLE, a sort of\r\nfishing-boat, common in Northumberland; the TILTBOAT, Sommers Quay,\r\nThames Street, in the XVIIth. century, and still at Billingsgate. This\r\nlast was an open passenger boat for Greenwich, Woolwich, Gravesend, and\r\nother places down the river. It took twelve hours to perform the voyage\r\nto Gravesend, and much more if the wind was contrary, and the boat had\r\nnot arrived before the tide turned. The tiltboats were superseded by\r\nsteamers in 1815. The Dark House, Billingsgate, was their\r\nstarting-place, and passengers would probably patronise the tavern with\r\nthis name in the immediate neighbourhood, as they go now for a glass of\r\nale and a sandwich to the RAILWAY, or STEAMBOAT INN, during the quarter\r\nof an hour preceding departure.\r\n\r\nThe FISHING SMACK was a public-house formerly standing near St Nicholas\r\nChurch, Liverpool. The sign represented a man standing in a cart loaded\r\nwith fish, and holding in his right hand what the artist intended to\r\nrepresent as a salmon. Underneath were the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    “This salmon has got a tail,\r\n    It’s very like a whale;\r\n    It’s a fish that’s very merry;\r\n    They say it’s catch’d at Derry;\r\n    It’s a fish that’s got a heart,\r\n  It’s catch’d and put in Dugdale’s cart.”\r\n\r\nThis truly classic production of the Muse of the Mersey continued for\r\nseveral years to adorn the host’s door, until a change in the occupant\r\nof the house induced a corresponding change of the sign, and the\r\nfollowing lines took the place of the preceding:--\r\n\r\n  “The cart and salmon has stray’d away,\r\n  And left the fishing-boat to stay,\r\n  When boisterous winds do drive you back,\r\n  Come in and drink at the Fishing-Smack.”[491]\r\n\r\nThe OLD BARGE was a sign in Bucklersbury: “When Walbrooke did lye open,\r\nbarges were rowed out of the Thames, or towed up so farre; and therefore\r\nthe place has ever since been called the Old Barge, of such a sign\r\nhanging out over the gate thereof.”[492] The Old Barge, or the OLD BOAT,\r\nis still frequently seen as a sign on the banks of some of the canals\r\nthrough which boats and barges are towed.\r\n\r\nThe BOAT, an isolated tavern in the open fields, at the back of the\r\nFoundling Hospital, was the head-quarters of the rioters and\r\nincendiaries, who, excited by the injudicious zeal of Lord George\r\nGordon, set London in a blaze during the “No Popery” riots in 1780.\r\n\r\nNEXT BOAT BY PAUL’S, in Upper Thames Street, may be seen on the trades\r\ntoken of an ale-house, evidently kept by a waterman, who used to ply\r\nwith his boat near St Paul’s. The token of this house represents a boat\r\ncontaining three men, over it the legend, “_Next Boat_.” “Next Oars” was\r\nthe cry of the watermen waiting for a fare. Tom Brown in his walk round\r\nLondon, says, “I steered him down Blackfryars towards the Thames side\r\ntill coming near the stairs, up started such a noisy multitude of grizly\r\nold Tritons, hollowing and hooting out _Next Oars_ and scullers, &c. And\r\nwith that I bawled out as loud as a speaking trumpet, ‘_Next Oars_,’ and\r\naway ran Captain Caron, and hollowed to his man Ben to bring the boat\r\nnear.” “Next Boat,” was also the sign of a public-house of note\r\nadjoining Holland’s Leaguer in Blackfriars, where Holland Street is now.\r\n\r\nThe Law is very badly represented--the JUDGE’S HEAD seems to be the only\r\nsign in honour of this branch of the Commonwealth. It was the sign of\r\nCharles King, a bookseller in Westminster Hall in 1718,[493] and may be\r\nreadily accounted for in that locality. It was also the first sign of\r\nJacob Tonson, the well-known bookseller and secretary of the Kit-Kat\r\nClub, when he lived near Inner Temple gate, Fleet Street. In 1697 when\r\nhe removed to Gray’s Inn gate, he adopted the SHAKESPEARE’S HEAD, under\r\nwhich he became famous. After 1712, he took a shop in the Strand,\r\nopposite Catherine Street, but without altering his sign, and there he\r\ndied in March 1736 possessed of a splendid fortune. This was that famous\r\nTonson who published the works of the most celebrated authors and poets\r\nof the day. Dryden was one of them. Liberality in those days was a word\r\nnot to be found in the dictionary of a publisher, as Dryden often\r\nexperienced; in one of his ill tempers, when Tonson had been putting on\r\nthe screw rather too much, the incensed poet began a satire upon him:--\r\n\r\n  “With leering look, bullfac’d, and freckled fair,\r\n  With two left legs, with Judas-colour’d hair,\r\n  And frowsy pores that taint the ambient air.”\r\n\r\nThese three lines he sent as a sample of his _savoir faire_ to the\r\npublisher, with the gentle addition: “Tell the dog that he who wrote\r\nthis can write more.” Tonson did not wish to see more, however, and\r\nDryden obtained what he desired. About the year 1720, Jacob Tonson left\r\nthe business to his nephew, Jacob Tonson, jun., son of his brother\r\nRichard, who, through the patronage of the Duke of Newcastle, became\r\nstationer, bookbinder, and printer to the Public Board, and this\r\nlucrative appointment was enjoyed by the Tonson family, or their\r\nassignees, till the month of January 1800.\r\n\r\nLot Goodal, BEADLE of St Martin-in-the-Fields, in 1680, had, like other\r\ncelebrities, taken his own goodly person for the sign of his house in\r\nRupert Street, as appears from his advertisement, in which, like a true\r\nDogberry, the public are informed that he had taken a silver watch with\r\na studded case “in custody.” The BROWN BILL was another constable’s\r\nsign:--\r\n\r\n  “Which is the constable’s house\r\n    At the sign of the _Brown Bill_?”\r\n\r\n  _Blurt, Master Constable or the Spaniard’s Nightwalk._ Tho. Middleton.\r\n  1602.\r\n\r\nThis brown bill was a kind of battle-axe, or hatchet affixed to a long\r\nstaff, used by constables. The name was transferred from the weapon to\r\nthe men who carried it:--\r\n\r\n  “_Const._ Come, my _brown bills_, we’ll roar,\r\n            Bounce loud at the tavern door.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\nThey were also called Billmen:--\r\n\r\n  “To us _billmen_ relate,\r\n  Why you stagger so late,\r\n  And how you came drunk so soon.”\r\n\r\n  _John Lilly’s Endymion._ 1591.\r\n\r\nLawyers are only commemorated in the _complimentary_ sign of the Good\r\nLawyer,[494] and in the ROLLS, a tavern kept by Ralph Massie, in\r\nChancery Lane, in the reign of Charles II. In various parts of the\r\nhouse, and particularly in the great room up stairs, the coats of arms\r\nof the Carew family spoke of its former possessors. Further back still,\r\nwe have it as a timber tenement belonging to the knights of St John of\r\nJerusalem, by whom it was sold to Cardinal Wolsey, who for a time\r\ninhabited it, before he had reached the summit of his pride and fame.\r\nBehind this building was the house and garden of Sir Walter Raleigh. But\r\nall these remnants of bygone glory were swept away in 1760, when the\r\nhouse was rebuilt, and the name changed into the CROWN AND ROLLS. The\r\nname of Rolls, it is needless to observe, was adopted from the\r\nneighbouring Rolls House, where the rolls and records of Chancery have\r\nbeen kept since the reign of Richard III.\r\n\r\nThe liberal arts are as badly represented on the signboard as the Bar.\r\nThe POET’S HEAD was a sign in St James’s Street in the seventeenth\r\ncentury; who the poet was it is impossible to say now; perhaps it was\r\nDryden, since the trades tokens represent a head crowned with bays. The\r\nsame sign had been used during the Commonwealth by Taylor the Water\r\npoet, but in his case the poet was Taylor himself, (see p. 48.) The FIVE\r\nINKHORNS, we gather from the trades tokens, was the sign of Walter\r\nHaddon, in Grub Street, a very appropriate trade emblem in that\r\nscribbling locality. There was also a house with this sign in Petticoat\r\nLane, opposite which Strype’s mother lived; letters of his are extant\r\naddressed:--\r\n\r\n  _These for his honoured Mother,_\r\n    _Mrs Hester Stryp, widow_\r\n      _dwelling in Petticoat Lane over_\r\n      _against the five Inkhorns, without_\r\n                          _Bishopsgate_\r\n                          _in London._\r\n\r\nPetticoat Lane in that time was the great manufacturing place for\r\ninkhorns. The HAND AND PEN was a scrivener’s sign, which was adopted by\r\nPeter Bales, Queen Elizabeth’s celebrated penman. Hollinshed says[495]\r\nthat\r\n\r\n  “He writ within the Compasse of a Penie in Latine, the Lord’s Prayer,\r\n  the Creed, the Ten Commandements, a praise to God, a Prayer for the\r\n  Queéne, his posie, his name, the daie of the month the yeare of our\r\n  Lord, and the reigne of the Queéne. And on the seuenteenth of August\r\n  next following, at Hampton Court, he presented the same to the Queenes\r\n  maiestie in the head of a ring of gold, couered with a christall, and\r\n  presented therewith an excellent spectacle, by him devised, for the\r\n  easier reading thereof; wherewith her maiestie read all that was\r\n  written therein with great admiration, and commended the same to the\r\n  Lords of the Councill and the ambassadors, and did weare the same\r\n  manie times vpon her finger.”\r\n\r\nBale was employed by Sir Francis Walsingham, and afterwards kept a\r\nwriting school at the upper end of the Old Bailey. In 1595, when nearly\r\nfifty years old, he had a trial of skill with one Daniel Johnson, by\r\nwhich he was the winner of a golden pen, of a value of £20, which, in\r\nthe pride of his victory, he set up as his sign. Upon this occasion,\r\nJohn Davis made the following epigram in his “Scourge of Folly:”--\r\n\r\n  “The _Hand_ and _Golden Pen_, Clophonion\r\n  Sets on his sign, to shew, O proud, poor soul,\r\n  Both where he wonnes, and how the same he won,\r\n  From writers fair, though he writ ever foul;\r\n  But by that Hand, that Pen so borne has been,\r\n  From Place to Place, that for the last half Yeare,\r\n  It scarce a sen’night at a place is seen.\r\n  That Hand so plies the Pen, though ne’er the neare,\r\n  For when Men seek it, elsewhere it is sent,\r\n  Or there shut up, as for the Plague or Rent,\r\n  Without which stay, it never still could stand,\r\n  Because the Pen is for a Running Hand.”[496]\r\n\r\nThe sign of the Hand and Pen was also used by the Fleet Street\r\nmarriage-mongers, to denote “marriages performed without imposition.”\r\n\r\nMusic-shops always adhered to the primitive custom of using the\r\ninstruments they sold as their signs; for instance, the HARP AND\r\nHAUTBOY, the sign of John Walsh, “servant to his Majesty,” in Catherine\r\nStreet in the Strand, in 1700.[497] Other music-shops had the FRENCH\r\nHORN AND VIOLIN; the VIOLIN, HAUTBOY, AND GERMAN FLUTE; the HAUTBOY AND\r\nTWO FLUTES; all these instruments in the woodcut above the shopbill,\r\nwhich was a copy of the sign, are placed perpendicularly beside each\r\nother, without any attempt at grouping. The HAUTBOY was one of the most\r\nconstant music-shop signs; it was formerly a favourite street\r\ninstrument, and might be heard at the Christmas “waits,” and on\r\noccasions of popular rejoicing. Waits even are said to have derived\r\ntheir name from it, that, according to one authority, being the old\r\nEnglish name of the hautboy.[498] This, however, we believe to be a\r\nmistake. The Waits were “watches”--_guêts_, who went round at certain\r\nhours of the night with music, to let it be known they were on the\r\nlook-out, and make people feel secure.\r\n\r\nNovello, the well-known music publisher, still adheres to the old\r\ntradition, and carries on business in the Poultry under the sign of the\r\nGOLDEN CROTCHET. Somewhat similar was the SOL LA, or the MERRY SONG (_le\r\nchant Gaillard_) of Guyot or Guy Marchant, a bookseller and printer in\r\nParis _circa_ 1490. His colophon here represents the two notes _sol la_,\r\nsurmounting two conjoined hands, in evident allusion to the words of the\r\nPange Lingua “SOLA FIDES.” At the side are represented two merry\r\ncobblers, a class of mechanics, who, from time immemorial, have been\r\nnoted above all others for merriment, and a habit of singing whilst at\r\ntheir work. It is a curious fact, that on the title-page of one of the\r\nbooks printed by Marchant, the “Epistola de Insulis de novo repertis,”\r\nhis _chant_ Gaillard is translated into “_Campo_ Gaillardo,” which seems\r\nto lead to the inference that this work had been printed by some one who\r\nhad heard of Marchant’s sign, but had never seen it, and merely adopted\r\nhis name as being well known in the literary world,--a fraud frequently\r\ncomplained of by the old printers.\r\n\r\nThe FRENCH HORN was once a very common sign, and is still of frequent\r\noccurrence; thus, there is a FRENCH HORN AND ROSE in Wood Street,\r\nCheapside; a FRENCH HORN AND HALF-MOON at Wandsworth; and a FRENCH HORN\r\nAND QUEEN’S HEAD in Smithfield. This last house was, for many years,\r\nkept by Peter Crawley, a noted member of the P. R., and there John Leech\r\nthe artist, and a friend, used to study low life and boxiana under the\r\ntutelage of Black Sam. Finally, in the seventeenth century, there was a\r\nHORN AND THREE TUNS in Leadenhall Street. The trades tokens represent it\r\nas a French horn; but a drinking horn would certainly have been a more\r\nuseful instrument in the company of three tuns. It was evidently a\r\ncorruption of the Bottle-makers’ arms, which were argent on a chevron\r\nsable, three bugle-horns of the first between three leather-bottles of\r\nthe second. These leather-bottles might easily be mistaken for tuns, and\r\nthe bugle-horn be modernised into a musical instrument.\r\n\r\nThis frequency of the Horn rather jars with the unpleasant signification\r\nthat instrument had in seventeenth century slang. Among the Roxburghe\r\nBallads (ii. 138) there is one entitled “The Extravagant Youth, or an\r\nEmblem of Prodigality,” with a woodcut representing a youth jumping into\r\nthe mouth of a large horn. On one side stands the father, seemingly in\r\ndistress; on the other is a mad-house, with the sign of THE FOOL, two of\r\nthe inmates looking out from behind the bars. The extravagant youth,\r\nafter expatiating on his mad career, says:--\r\n\r\n  “But now all my glory is clearly decay’d,\r\n  And into the horn myself have betray’d.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  All comforts now from us are flown,\r\n  My father in Bedlam makes his moan,\r\n  And I in the _counter_ a prisoner thrown,\r\n  This Horn is a figure by which it is known.”\r\n\r\nThe BUGLE HORN is fully as common; it occurs on a trades token of 1667\r\nas the sign of a house in Aldersgate Street, and is still to be seen on\r\nmany inns by the roadside, where the mail coach, in the good old\r\ncoaching time, used to announce its arrival by a cheerful tune from the\r\nguard’s horn. Sometimes the HORN was used in a different sense. It was\r\nthe sign and badge of the cattle doctor and village gelder, and came to\r\nbe exhibited as such either from its use in drenching animals, or from\r\nthe fact of such an instrument being blown by the doctor, to give notice\r\nto the villagers of his approach. At Messingham, Lincoln, the Horn Inn,\r\na century ago, was kept by such a personage. Further on, at p. 369, this\r\nprofessional is mentioned in connexion with Tom of Bedlam.\r\n\r\nThe HARP, in the beginning of the eighteenth century, was the sign of a\r\nbird-fancier, “over against Somerset House in the Strand;”[499] and is\r\nstill used as the sign of many public-houses, generally denoting an\r\nIrish origin. The JEW’S HARP (an instrument formerly called _jeu\r\ntrompe_, Jew’s trump, _i.e._, toy trumpet) was in former times the sign\r\nof a house with bowery tea-gardens and thickly-foliated “snuggeries,” in\r\nwhat was once Marylebone Park, near the top of Portland Place, but\r\nremoved on the laying out of Regent’s Park. Mr Onslow the Speaker used\r\nto go there in plain attire, and sitting in the chimney-corner, join in\r\nthe humours of the customers, until, being recognised by the landlord\r\none day, as he was riding in his golden coach to the House in state, he\r\nfound, on going in the evening for his quiet pipe and glass, that his\r\nincognito was betrayed. This broke the charm, and like the fairies in\r\nthe legend, he never more returned after that day. At the end of the\r\nlast century there was another Jew’s Harp Tavern [and Tea-gardens] in\r\nIslington. It consisted of a large upper room, ascended by a staircase\r\non the outside for the accommodation of the company on ball nights, and\r\nin this room large parties dined. Facing the south front of the premises\r\nwas a large semicircular enclosure, with boxes for tea and ale\r\ndrinkers, guarded by deal-board soldiers, between every box, painted in\r\nproper colours. In the centre of this opening were tables and seats\r\nplaced for the smokers; a trap-ball ground was on the eastern side of\r\nthe house, whilst the western side served for a tennis court; there were\r\nalso public and private skittle-grounds. We find a clue to this rather\r\nodd sign in Ben Jonson’s play of the “Devil is an Ass,” Act i., scene 1,\r\nfrom which it appears that it was formerly a custom to keep a fool in a\r\ntavern, who, for the edification of the customers, used to play on a\r\n_Jew’s harp_, sitting on a joint-stool.\r\n\r\nOne of the signs originally used exclusively by apothecaries was the\r\nMORTAR AND PESTLE, their well-known implements for pounding drugs. Among\r\nthe celebrities who sold medicines under this emblem was the noted John\r\nMoore, “author of the celebrated Worm Powder,” to whom Pope addressed\r\nsome stanzas beginning:--\r\n\r\n  “How much, egregious Moore, are we\r\n    Deceived by shows and forms;\r\n  Whate’er we think, whate’er we see,\r\n    All human kind are worms.”\r\n\r\nHis shop was in St Lawrence Poultney Lane. Every week the newspapers\r\ncontained advertisements proving, by the most wonderful cures, the\r\nefficacy of his powders.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century a publican in Paris adopted the sign of the\r\nPESTLE, on account of his living in the Rue de la Mortellerie, (Mortar\r\nStreet.) His house was in high repute amongst the gallants of the\r\nperiod, which procured him a visit from Master Villon, who thus\r\ndescribes it:--\r\n\r\n  “S’en vint en une hotellerie,\r\n  Rue de la Mortellerie.\r\n  Ou pend l’enseigne du _Pestel_,\r\n  A bon logis et bon hostel.”[500]\r\n\r\n  VILLON, _Franches Repues_.\r\n\r\nThe Apothecary leads us to the Barber, or rather Barber-Surgeon, and the\r\nBARBER’S POLE, which dates from the time when barbers practised\r\nphlebotomy: the patient undergoing this operation had to grasp the pole\r\nin order to make the blood flow more freely. This use of the pole is\r\nillustrated in more than one illuminated MS. As the pole was of course\r\nliable to be stained with blood, it was painted red; when not in use,\r\nbarbers were in the habit of suspending it outside the door with the\r\nwhite linen swathing-bands twisted round it; this, in latter times, gave\r\nrise to the pole being painted red and white, or black and white, or\r\neven with red, white, and blue lines winding round it. It was stated by\r\nLord Thurlow in the House of Peers, July 17, 1797, when he opposed the\r\nSurgeon’s Incorporation Bill, that, “by a statute still in force, the\r\nbarbers and surgeons were each to use a pole. The barbers were to have\r\ntheirs _blue_ and _white_ striped, with no other appendage, but the\r\nsurgeons [which were the same in other respects] were to have a gallipot\r\nand a red flag in addition, to denote the particular nature of their\r\nvocation.”\r\n\r\nBesides the well-known brass soap-basins appended to the pole, the\r\nbarbers in former times used to have other and more repulsive signs of\r\ntheir profession:--\r\n\r\n  “His pole with pewter[501] basons hung,\r\n  Black, rotten teeth in order strung,\r\n  Rang’d cups that in the window stood,\r\n  Lined with red rags to look like blood,\r\n  Did well his threefold trade explain,\r\n  Who shaved, drew teeth, and breathed a vein.”\r\n\r\nIn Constantinople, where the barber still acts as surgeon and dentist,\r\nthe teeth drawn by him are worked in ornamental patterns intermixed with\r\nblue beads, and hung as trophies in the window. Some of our London\r\ndentists even yet follow this disgusting custom, for in no less a\r\nthoroughfare than Sloane Street there is a certain chemist-dentist who\r\nexhibits in his window a whole bottleful of decayed teeth. Instead of\r\ncups “lined with red rags to look like blood,” the genuine article was\r\nformerly exhibited in the windows; but this was already prohibited at an\r\nearly period, since the “Liber Albus” enjoins “that no barber be so bold\r\nor so daring as to put _blood in their windows_ openly or in view of\r\nfolks; but let them have it carried privily unto the Thames, under pain\r\nof paying two shillings unto the use of the Sheriffs.”\r\n\r\nAs “a little learning is dangerous,” the barber of the olden times\r\ngenerally contrived to make himself more or less ridiculous. Steele\r\nsays:--“The particularity of this man [Don Saltero, see p. 95] put me\r\ninto a deep thought whence it should proceed that of all the lower\r\norders barbers should go further in hitting the ridiculous than any\r\nother set of men. Watermen brawl, cobblers sing: but why must a barber\r\nbe for ever a politician, a musician, an anatomist, a poet, and a\r\nphysician?” This love of music was at all times an idiosyncrasy of the\r\nknights of the brass basin. Morley, in his “Plain and Easie Introduction\r\nto Practicall Musicke,” says:--“It should seem you came lately from a\r\nbarber’s shop, where you heard Gregory Walker or a Corranta plaide in\r\nthe new proportions.” Henry Bold, in the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, speaks of ancient tunes “still sung to _Barbers’ citterns_”,\r\nviz., the “Lady’s Fall;” “John come kiss me now;” “Green Sleeves and\r\nPudding Pies;” “The Punk’s Delight,” &c. And Tom Brown, in his\r\n“Amusements for the Meridian of London,” remarks:--\r\n\r\n  “In a Barber’s shop I saw a Beau so overladen with wig that there was\r\n  no difference between his head and the wooden one that stood in the\r\n  window. The fop it seems was newly come to his Estate, though not to\r\n  the years of Discretion, and was singing the Song: ‘Happy the child\r\n  whose father is gone to the Devil;’ and the Barber was all the while\r\n  keeping time on his Cittern, for, you know, a Cittern and a Barber is\r\n  as natural as milk to a calf, or the bears to be attended by a\r\n  Bagpiper.”\r\n\r\nThe cittern is also mentioned by Ned Ward:--“I would sooner hear an old\r\nbarber sing ‘Whittington’s Bells’ upon a cittern.”\r\n\r\nBut enough of their musical parts; as for their learning no examples are\r\nwanting: Partridge, the classical scholar, in Fielding’s “Tom Jones;”\r\nVossius’ barber, who used to comb his hair in iambics;[502] and\r\nSmollett’s Hugh Strap, are excellent specimens. This last one was\r\nsketched from life; his real name was Hugh Hughson; he died in the\r\nparish of St Martin’s-in-the-Field, at the advanced age of eighty-five,\r\nhaving kept a barber-shop in that locality upwards of forty years. His\r\nshop was hung round with Latin quotations, and he would frequently\r\npoint out to his customers the several scenes in “Roderick Random”\r\npertaining to himself, which had their foundation, not in the Doctor’s\r\ninventive fancy, but in truth and reality. The meeting at the\r\nbarber-shop in Newcastle, the subsequent mistake at the inn, their\r\narrival together in London, and the assistance they experienced from\r\nStrap’s friends, were all facts. He is said to have left behind him an\r\ninterleaved copy of “Roderick Random,” showing how far we are indebted\r\nto the creative fancy of Doctor Smollett, and to what extent the\r\nincidents recorded were founded upon fact.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago there was a hairdresser in the Rue Racine, who,\r\nprobably on account of his proximity to the universities of the Collège\r\nde France and the Sorbonne, had this inscription on his window: “κειρω\r\nτακιστα και σιναω,” “I shear quickly and am silent.” This classical\r\nhairdresser was evidently acquainted with the answers given by\r\nAnaxagoras to a barber who asked him, “How do you wish to have your\r\nbeard shaved?” and who received the laconic answer, “without talking.”\r\nThe shutters and windows of our Parisian worthy were covered with\r\ninscriptions in foreign languages, the number of which was only\r\nsurpassed by the Bible shop in Brompton, during the time of the\r\nInternational Exhibition in 1862.\r\n\r\nAn eccentric barber opened a shop under the walls of the King’s Bench\r\nPrison; the windows being broken when he entered the house, he mended\r\nthem with paper, on which appeared, “Shave for a penny,” with the usual\r\ninvitation to customers; whilst on his door was scrawled the following\r\nrhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “Here lives Jemmie Wright,\r\n  Shaves almost as well as any man in England,\r\n  Almost--not quite.”\r\n\r\nFoote, who delighted in anything eccentric, saw this inscription, and\r\nhoping to extract some wit from the author, whom he justly concluded to\r\nbe an odd character, he pulled off his hat, and thrusting his head\r\nthrough a paper pane into the shop, called out, “Is Jimmy Wright at\r\nhome?” The barber immediately forced his own head through another pane\r\ninto the street, and replied: “No, sir, he has just popt out.”\r\n\r\nNumerous more or less witty barbers’ inscriptions are recorded; one of\r\nthe best is that attributed to Dean Swift, penned by him for a barber,\r\nwho at the same time kept a public-house:--\r\n\r\n  “Rove not from _pole_ to _pole_, but step in here,\r\n  Where nought excels the shaving but the beer.”\r\n\r\nA variation often met is:--\r\n\r\n  “Rove not from pole to pole, but here turn in,\r\n  Where nought excels the shaving but the gin.”\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott in his “Fortunes of Nigel,” vol ii., as a motto to\r\nchap. iv., gives the following version:--\r\n\r\n  “Rove not from pole to pole--the man lives here,\r\n  Whose razor’s only equall’d by his beer;\r\n  And where, in either sense, the Cockney-put,\r\n  May, if he pleases, get confounded cut.”\r\n\r\nThe amalgamation of the two trades has led to some other rhymes and\r\njokes. A barber-publican in Dudley has the following _barbar_ous joke:--\r\n\r\n  “What do you think\r\n  I’ll shave you for nothing and give you some drink?”\r\n\r\nThe point of this joke lies in the punctuation, which the illiterate\r\n_shavers_ coming to the shop are sure to treat with supreme contempt;\r\nbut a barber in Ratcliffe Highway, _circa_ 1825, had the following _bona\r\nfide_ invitation:--\r\n\r\n  “Hair cut with despatch,\r\n  Shave well in a minute,\r\n  And a glass in the bar--gain\r\n  With a thimbleful in it.”[503]\r\n\r\nAnother common inscription is the following:--“I tell U there is no\r\nshaving to X L----’s” (name of the barber.) The Parisian barbers are\r\nmuch on a par with their English colleagues in brilliancy of wit and\r\ninventive power: “Ici on rajeunit,”[504] used to be a frequent\r\ninscription with them; others have:--\r\n\r\n  “La nature donne barbe et cheveux,\r\n  Et moi je les coupe tous les deux.”\r\n\r\nor--\r\n\r\n  “A toutes les figures dédiant mes rasoirs,\r\n  Je nargue la critique des fidèles mirroirs.”[505]\r\n\r\nTools belonging to various handicrafts are common public-house signs at\r\nthe present day. The AXE is a very old sign; it was a well-known\r\ncarriers’ inn in Aldermanbury in the seventeenth century, and was one of\r\nthe places visited in 1634 by that thirsty tourist, Drunken Barnaby.\r\nFrom this inn, the first regular line of stage waggons from London to\r\nLiverpool was established towards the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\nThere were constantly some of them on the road, for they left every\r\nMonday and Thursday, and it took them ten days in summer, and as many as\r\ntwelve in winter to perform the journey.\r\n\r\nIn 1642 there appeared “A Petition from the Towne and County of\r\nLeicester unto the King’s most excellent Majestie,” which was “printed\r\nfor William Gay, and to be sold at his shop in Hosier Lane, at the\r\n_signe of the Axe_, July 29, 1642.” When we consider that “the King’s\r\nmost excellent Majestie,” was Charles I., we may come to the conclusion\r\nthat there is something in a sign, as well as in a name; it was\r\ncertainly an ominous and _bad sign_ for the king. The _Cross Axes_ is a\r\nsign at Preston, Bolton, &c. The axe is also found combined with various\r\nother carpenter’s tools, as the AXE AND SAW, Carlton, Newmarket; AXE AND\r\nCOMPASSES in many places; AXE AND CLEAVER, in Boston, Yorkshire. Another\r\nsign, complimentary to the same class of workmen, was the TWO SAWYERS,\r\nwhich, at the end of the last century, was to be seen near the garden\r\nwall of the archiepiscopal palace at Lambeth; not unlikely, this was the\r\nsame house, of which trades tokens are extant from the time of Charles\r\nII., when it was kept by John Raines, and its locality is described as\r\nthe “New Plantation, Narrow Wall, Lambeth.”\r\n\r\nSigns referring to iron in its various states are very common on\r\npublic-houses, as the smith is generally a good customer to them. Iron\r\nseems to have a dyspeptic effect even in the bowels of the earth, if we\r\nmay judge from the quantity of MINERS’ ARMS in Staffordshire,\r\nWarwickshire, and the black country, in which latitudes teetotalism\r\nevidently has made but little progress; the DAVY LAMP is another sign\r\nintended to court the custom of miners, but being almost exclusively for\r\nworkmen in coal pits, it only occurs in Northumberland. The FORGE, or\r\nthe THREE FORGES, is common in the Midland iron districts. The\r\nCINDER-OVEN occurs in Norwich. The ANVIL, the ANVIL AND BLACKSMITH, the\r\nANVIL AND HAMMER, the SMITH AND SMITHY, &c., are all common about\r\nSheffield. So are HAMMERS, combined with various instruments, as\r\nPINCERS, VICE, STITHY, &c. The TWO SMITHS was a sign in the Minories in\r\n1655; the trades tokens of the house represent two men working at the\r\nanvil. HOBNAILS is a sign in Dudley, that town having been famous for\r\nthe manufacture of nails of every description, even as early as the time\r\nof Henry VIII., for the nails used in building the hall at Hampton Court\r\ncame from there, and the original accounts preserved in the Public\r\nRecord Office state that there was “Payde to Raynalde _Warde_, of\r\n_Dudley_, for 7350 of dubbyll tenpenny nayles inglys at 11s. the 1000.”\r\n\r\nThe BAG OF NAILS was once a very common sign; there is one still\r\nremaining in Arabella Row, Pimlico. “About fifty years ago, the original\r\nsign might have been seen at the front of the house, which was a satyr\r\nof the woods, and a group of jolly dogs, ycleped Bacchanals. But the\r\nsatyr having been painted with cloven feet, and painted black, it was by\r\nthe common people called the DEVIL, while the Bacchanalians were\r\ntransmuted by a comical process into a Bag of Nails.”[506] This was,\r\nhowever, only an old slang name for the house, for, in the trial of\r\nCatlin, Patterson, and others, for conspiracy, one of the witnesses\r\ndescribing the place where the conspirators used to meet, says: “He went\r\ninto a public-house, the sign of the DEVIL AND BAG OF NAILS, for so that\r\ngentry called it amongst themselves, (though it was the BLACKMOOR’S HEAD\r\nAND WOOLPACK,) by Buckingham Gate.”[507]\r\n\r\nA _bona fide_ representation of a bag of nails was also used as a sign,\r\nas may be seen on the trades token of Henry Hurdam in Tuttle (Tothill)\r\nStreet, Westminster, 1663, where the bag of nails is combined with a\r\nhammer crowned. And as it would be difficult to guess what the bag\r\ncontained, and nobody cares to buy “a pig in a poke,” the nails were\r\nsometimes represented protruding through it, as on the token of Samuel\r\nHincks of Whitechapel, 1669. A somewhat similar sign is expressed in\r\nRouen, Rue des Bons Enfans; it is carved in stone, and represents a bag,\r\nwith smith’s tools protruding out of it.\r\n\r\nBakers and millers also are represented by a variety of signs. Beginning\r\nat the BUSHEL, a sign on the Bankside in the seventeenth century, and\r\nthe SHOVEL AND SIEVE, the sign of a brush and turnery warehouse among\r\nthe Bagford Bills, we next accompany the corn to the mill, where we\r\nmeet the DUSTY MILLER, a favourite sign in some parts of Yorkshire and\r\nLancashire. A reminiscence of childhood may have suggested the epithet\r\nin this sign, for there is the well known nursery rhyme,\r\n\r\n  “Millery, Millery, Dusty poll,\r\n  How many sacks have you stole?”\r\n\r\nThe MILLSTONE may be seen at Stockport and Macclesfield.\r\n\r\nThe WINDMILL itself is a very old sign. It was a tavern in Lothbury, Old\r\nJewry, frequented by fast men in the reigns of Elizabeth, James, and\r\nCharles I. Wellbred, in “Every Man in his Humour,” (a play by Ben\r\nJonson,) dates his letter to Edward Knowell from this house:--\r\n\r\n  “Why, Ned, I beseech thee, hast thou forsworn all thy friends in the\r\n  Old Jewry, or doest thou think us all Jews that inhabit there,” &c.\r\n\r\nIt is named amongst the list of inns “viewed” previous to the visit of\r\nCharles V. in 1522.\r\n\r\n  “Hugh Clapton, Mercer, mayor, in 1492, dwelt in this house and kept\r\n  his Mayoralty there; it is now a tavern, and has to sign a Windmill.\r\n  And thus much for this house, sometime a Jew’s synagogue [in 1262,]\r\n  since a house of friars, [fratres de penitentia Jesu or de Sacca,\r\n  1275,] then a nobleman’s house, [Robert Fitz Walter, 1305,] after that\r\n  a merchant’s house, wherein Mayoralties have been kept, and now a wine\r\n  taverne.”--_Stow._\r\n\r\nThe PEEL, _i.e._, the wooden shovel with a long handle used by bakers to\r\nplace bread in the oven, was the sign of John Alder, in Leadenhall\r\nStreet, 1668. Next comes the basket or PANYER, to bring bread round,\r\nwhich gave its name to “a passage out of Paternoster Row--called of such\r\na sign Panyer Alley.”[508] This is the highest spot in the City of\r\nLondon, as we are informed from an inscription under a stone figure of a\r\nboy sitting on a pannier, eating a very questionable bunch of grapes:\r\n\r\n  “When you have sought the City round,\r\n  Yet still this is the highest ground.\r\n\r\n  _Aug._ 26, 1688.”\r\n\r\nThe Pannier was not an uncommon trade emblem. The BAKER AND BASKET is\r\nthe sign of a public-house in Leman Street, and another in Worship\r\nStreet. The claims to superior usefulness of the BAKER AND BREWER are\r\nheld forth triumphantly to the advantage of the latter in some signs of\r\nthis name. One, in Wash Lane, Birmingham, gives a pictorial\r\nrepresentation of it; the baker’s hand is resting on what is usually\r\ncalled the “Staff of Life,”--namely, a loaf of very respectable\r\ndimensions; the brewer exhibits “with artful pride,” a foaming tankard,\r\nwhen the following dialogue ensues:--\r\n\r\n  “The Baker says, I’ve the Staff of Life,\r\n    And you’re a silly elf;\r\n  The Brewer replied, with artful pride,\r\n    Why, _this is life itself_.”\r\n\r\nThe TWO BREWERS, or the TWO JOLLY BREWERS, used to be very common, but\r\nis now gradually becoming obsolete. It represented two brewers’ men\r\ncarrying a barrel of beer slung between them on a pole; it was also\r\nfrequently called the TWO DRAYMEN. In the bar of the QUEEN’S HEAD\r\nTavern, Great Queen Street, is preserved a carved wooden sign, which\r\nformerly hung before this house, representing two men standing near a\r\nlarge tun. The DRAY AND HORSES, meaning of course the brewer’s dray, has\r\nnow in some instances superseded the Two Jolly Brewers. The STILL, the\r\nchief implement in the manufacture of spirits, is very appropriate\r\nbefore the houses where the produce of the still is sold: frequently it\r\nis combined with other objects.\r\n\r\nThe BOY AND BARREL, to be seen in Dagger Lane, London, and in many\r\ncountry places, is all that remains of the little Bacchus on a tun,\r\nformerly in almost every ale-house:--\r\n\r\n                “A little Punch-\r\n  Gut Bacchus dangling of a bunch,\r\n  Sits loftily enthron’d upon\r\n  What’s called (in Miniature) a Tun.”\r\n\r\n  _Compleat Vintner._ London, 1720, p. 86.\r\n\r\nThe BOY AND CUP at Norwich, in 1750, was a variation of this sign. Other\r\nbrewers and distillers’ measures also are exhibited, as the BARREL; the\r\nPORTER BUTT, (three in Bath;) the BRANDY CASKS, (three in Bristol;) the\r\nRUM PUNCHEON, at Boston, Lincoln, and such like. Promises of fair\r\ndealing are held out in the sign of the FULL MEASURE, (four in Hull;)\r\nthe GOLDEN MEASURE, Lowgate, Hull; and the FOAMING TANKARD; or, an\r\nappeal is made to public joviality by such a sign as the PARTING POT, at\r\nStamford, Lincoln.\r\n\r\nShoemakers generally follow the advice of the proverb, _ne sutor ultra\r\ncrepidam_, and confine themselves to the sign of the LAST, which, for\r\nvariety’s sake, they paint red, blue, gold, &c. But since “cobblers and\r\ntinkers are the best ale drinkers,” many alehouses have adopted this\r\nsign also. A Crispin who keeps an ale-house near Liscard, Chester, has\r\nshown himself “true to the _last_,” by putting under his sign of a\r\nWooden Shoe or Last:--\r\n\r\n  “All day long I have sought good beer,\r\n  And, _at the last_, I have found it here.”\r\n\r\nThe SHEARS was originally a tailor’s sign, though like most other trade\r\nemblems it had become common in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n  “Snip, snap, quoth the tailor’s shears;\r\n  Alas, poor Louse, beware thy ears.”\r\n\r\nThis elegant little verse is quoted by Randle Holme, and seems to have\r\nbeen thought such a good joke, that a canny Scotchman, buried in Paisley\r\nAbbey, had a pictorial representation of it on his headstone. Charles\r\nMackie, who wrote the history of that Abbey, says it is an obliterated\r\ncross; more probably, however, it is a _fleur de luce_: this would also\r\nagree with the Scottish pronunciation of the name of the insect, which\r\nis exactly the same as the last part of that heraldic charge.\r\n\r\nThe HAND AND SHEARS, in Cloth Fair, Smithfield, played an important part\r\nat the opening of Bartholomew Fair. It was customary to make the\r\nproclamation for opening the fair late in the afternoon of August 23d,\r\nbut the showmen and traders opened their booths early in the morning:--\r\n\r\n  “Lawful objections being made to this, a riotous assembly met the\r\n  night before the day of the Mayor’s Proclamation at the public-house\r\n  within Cloth Fair, in which the Court of Piepoudre was held,[509] the\r\n  _Hand and Shears_--now transformed into a tall brick gin-palace--and\r\n  at midnight sallied forth, bearing along, in later years, the effigy\r\n  of a woman to represent Lady Holland, (who must have been instigator,\r\n  and it would seem, first leader of the mob,) and the mob--knocking at\r\n  doors, ringing bells, clamouring and rioting, some five thousand\r\n  strong, during three hours of the middle of the night--proclaimed for\r\n  itself, in its own way, that Bartholomew Fair was open. The first\r\n  irregular proclamation was for many years made by a company of\r\n  tailors, who met the night before the legal proclamation at the Hand\r\n  and Shears, elected a chairman, and as the clock struck twelve went\r\n  out into Cloth Fair, each with a _pair of shears in his hand_. The\r\n  chairman then proclaimed the Fair to the expectant mob, who all sped\r\n  on their errand of riot, to arouse with the news of it the sleepers in\r\n  the neighbourhood of Smithfield.”[510]\r\n\r\nThe THREE CROWNED NEEDLES looks also like a tailor’s sign, and from the\r\nevidence of a trades token of 1669 we know that it was the sign of a\r\nshop in Aldersgate. Hatton thinks that a similar sign may have given its\r\nname to Threadneedle Street, (Three Needle Street.) Three Crowned\r\nNeedles was a charge in the needle-makers’ company’s arms. It is a\r\ncurious fact that all the needles used in England up to the time of\r\nQueen Elizabeth were of foreign make; those sold in Cheapside in the\r\nreign of Queen Mary were made by a Spanish negro, who carried the secret\r\nof their manufacture with him to the grave. In 1566 they were\r\nmanufactured under the direction of a German, Elias Grause, and after\r\nthat time only it seems that we had learned how to make them.\r\n\r\nAmong agricultural signs, the PLOUGH leads the van, sometimes\r\naccompanied by the legend “Speed the Plough.” Of two inscriptions on the\r\nsign of the Plough that have come under our observation, both contain\r\nsound advice. That of the Plough at Filey might well be remembered by\r\n“afternoon” farmers: it says:--\r\n\r\n  “He who by the Plough would thrive,\r\n  Himself must either hold or drive;”\r\n\r\nwhilst on the Plough Inn, Alnwick, the following is cut in stone:--\r\n\r\n    “That which your father old\r\n  Hath purchased and left you to possess,\r\n    Do you dearly hold\r\n  To shew your worthiness. 1717.”\r\n\r\nIn the inventory of church goods made at Holbeach, in Lincoln, at the\r\ntime of the Reformation:--\r\n\r\n  Wm. Davy bought the sygne whereon the plowghe did stond for xvj^{d}.\r\n\r\nThis probably refers to the signs or badges exhibited by the religious\r\nguilds in the middle ages over the altars and as decorations in their\r\nchurches, which were in some measure of the nature of other signs, in\r\npointing out certain fraternities or trades, besides possessing a\r\nsecondary and religious meaning.\r\n\r\nThe PLOUGH AND HORSES is a sign at Branston, Lincoln. The PLOUGH AND\r\nHARROW is very common. Two doors west from the Harrow Inn lived Isaac\r\nWalton, about 1624, carrying on the business of “milliner and sempster,”\r\nor what we should now call a linen-draper. He afterwards resided at a\r\nhouse in Chancery Lane, until he left London, for fear of having his\r\nmorals corrupted--as he himself asserted. Goldsmith’s tailor, who lived\r\nat the sign of the Harrow, has gained immortality by the bad taste of\r\npoor Goldy. On one occasion--\r\n\r\n  “Goldsmith strutted about, bragging of his dress, and, I believe, was\r\n  seriously vain of it, for his mind was wonderfully prone to such\r\n  impressions. ‘Come, come,’ said Garrick, ‘talk no more of that, you\r\n  are perhaps the worst--eh, eh.’ Goldsmith was eagerly attempting to\r\n  interrupt him, when Garrick went on, laughing ironically, ‘Nay, you\r\n  will always _look_ like a gentleman, but I am talking of being _well_\r\n  or _ill drest_.’ ‘Well, let me tell you,’ said Goldsmith, ‘when my\r\n  tailor brought home my bloom-coloured coat, he said, “Sir, I have a\r\n  favour to beg of you. When anybody asks you who made your clothes, be\r\n  pleased to mention, _John Filby, at the Harrow in Water Lane_.”’\r\n  JOHNSON. ‘Why, sir, that was because he knew the strange colour would\r\n  attract crowds to gaze at it, and then they might hear of him, and see\r\n  how well he could make a coat even of so absurd a colour.’”[511]\r\n\r\nNear Bagshot there is a public-house called the JOLLY FARMER, a\r\ncorruption of the GOLDEN FARMER, a nickname obtained by one of the\r\nformer possessors on account of his wealth, and his custom of paying his\r\nrent always in guineas, which--so says the legend--he obtained as a\r\nfootpad on Bagshot Heath. That some such thing happened is evident from\r\nthe _Weekly Journal_, March 29, 1718, where allusion is made to “Bagshot\r\nHeath, near the Gibbet where the _Golden Farmer_ hanged in chains.” The\r\nuse of this word _Jolly_, on the signboard, formerly so common in our\r\n“Merry England,” is now gradually dying away. Whatever be the opinion of\r\nour workmen upon the subject of national good humour, they no longer\r\ndesire to be advertised as _Jolly_; it is vulgar, and they prefer _Arms_\r\nlike their betters--hence those heraldic anomalies of the GRAZIERS’\r\nARMS, the FARMERS’ ARMS, the CHAFF-CUTTERS’ ARMS, the PUDDLERS’ ARMS,\r\nthe PAVIORS’ ARMS, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe SHEPHERD AND SHEPHERDESS is one of those signs reminding us of--\r\n\r\n  “The tea-cup days of hoop and hood\r\n  And when the patch was worn.”\r\n\r\ncalling up pictures of rouged shepherdesses with jaunty straw hats on\r\nthe top of powdered hair a foot high, short quilted petticoats and\r\nhigh-heeled boots, courted in madrigals by shepherds dressed in the\r\nheight of the elegance of the New Exchange gallants, with ribboned\r\ncrooks and flowered-satin waistcoats. It was the sign of a pleasure\r\nresort in the City Road, Islington, much frequented in the eighteenth\r\ncentury for amusement, and by invalids for the pure, healthy, country\r\nair of Islington, which was then a charming village, more rural in the\r\nmidst of its meadows and rivulets than Richmond is now. Cakes, cream,\r\nand furmity were its great attractions:--\r\n\r\n  “To the _Shepherd and Shepherdess_ then they go\r\n  To tea with their wives for a constant rule,\r\n  And next cross the road to the _Fountain_ also,\r\n  And there they sit so pleasant and cool,\r\n        And see in and out\r\n        The folks walk about,\r\n  And gentlemen angling in Peerless Pool.”[512]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\nBRAZEN SERPENT.\r\n\r\n(Reynold Wolfe, circa 1550.)\r\n\r\nGREEN MAN.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1760.)\r\n\r\nSIR ROGER DE COVERLEY.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1780.)\r\n\r\nASS PLAYING ON THE HARP.\r\n\r\n(Chartres Cathedral, circa 1420.)]\r\n\r\nMore business-like is the sign of the SHEPHERD AND DOG; he, too, wears\r\n_patches_, but not on his face; so with the SHEPHERD AND CROOK, and the\r\nCROOK AND SHEARS. All these may be found in most villages, and refer to\r\nthe inferior farm-labourer, to whom the care of the flock is intrusted,\r\nand not the elegant Corydon or Alexis.\r\n\r\nThe merry, thirsty time of haymaking is commemorated in the usual signs\r\nof a LOAD OF HAY and the CROSS SCYTHES. There is a LOAD OF HAY tavern on\r\nHaverstock Hill, a favourite place for Sunday afternoon excursionists in\r\nthe summer time. Many years ago the eccentricity of Davies the landlord\r\nwas one of the attractions of the place. Lately the house has been\r\nre-built, and it is now only a suburban gin-palace. The MATTOCK AND\r\nSPADE, and the SPADE AND BECKET, refer to field labour; the first is\r\nvery general, the second less so; but an example occurs at Chatteris,\r\nCambridgeshire. The PEAT SPADE, Longstock, Hants, tells its own tale.\r\nThe DAIRY MAID was in great favour with the London cheesemongers of the\r\nseventeenth century. Akerman gives a trades token of such a sign in\r\nCatherine Street, in 1653, which is an amusing specimen of the liberties\r\nthe token engravers took with the king’s English, the country Phillis\r\nbeing transformed into a “_Deary Made_.” The Dutch in the seventeenth\r\ncentury used the sign for a rather heterogenous trade: it seems that the\r\nprocess of sucking or inhaling the tobacco smoke carried back their\r\nideas to tender years of innocence and milk diet, and so the Dairy Maid\r\nbecame the sign, _par excellence_, of tobacco shops. Even at the present\r\nday that idea is not quite forgotten; tobacco boxes or other smoking\r\nimplements are sometimes seen amongst that nation, with the words,\r\n“Troost voor Zuigelingen,” “consolation for sucklings.” The inscriptions\r\nunder these signs were occasionally very curious:--\r\n\r\n  “Toebak dat edel kruyt soveel daarvan getuygen\r\n  Al die lang zyn gespeent beginnen weer te zuygen.”[513]\r\n\r\nOn the GOUDSCHE MELKMEID in Amsterdam:--\r\n\r\n  “Goede Waar en goed bescheid\r\n  Krygt gy hier in de GOUDSCHE MELKMEID\r\n  Puyk van Verinas en Virginia Tabac\r\n  Kunt gy hier rooken op uw gemak.”[514]\r\n\r\nAnother had:--\r\n\r\n  “Leckere Neusen, eele baasen,\r\n  Die by ’t klinken van de glaasen\r\n  Tot het smooken zyt bereyt;\r\n  Zoek je ’t beste van den acker\r\n  Puyk verynis? komt dan wacker\r\n  By de walsse mellik-meid.”[515]\r\n\r\nHARVEST-HOME, the pleasant time of congratulation and feasting, must be\r\nan alluring sign for the villagers, calling up recollections of all the\r\nfestivities yearly celebrated on that grand occasion, when--\r\n\r\n                “the harvest treasures all\r\n  Are gather’d in beyond the rage of storms,\r\n  Sure to the swain.”--_Thomson._\r\n\r\nOne of the misfortunes of the “nimium fortunati sua si bona norint” is\r\npictured in the CART OVERTHROWN, which is a public-house sign at Lower\r\nEdmonton; though how it came to be such is difficult to guess. On\r\nHighgate Hill there is an old roadside inn, the Fox and Crown, which\r\ndisplays on its front a fine gilt coat of arms with the following\r\ninscription underneath:--\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------- +\r\n  | 6TH JULY 1837. |\r\n  | |\r\n  | THIS COAT OF ARMS IS A GRANT |\r\n  | FROM QUEEN VICTORIA, FOR SER-|\r\n  | VICES RENDERED TO HER MAJESTY |\r\n  | WHEN IN DANGER TRAVELLING |\r\n  | DOWN THIS HILL. |\r\n  +--------------------------------- +\r\n\r\nThe carriage conveying Her Majesty was proceeding down the hill without\r\na skid on the wheel, when something started the horses, and the\r\noccurrence above narrated took place. The late landlord died in\r\ndistressed circumstances, and he stoutly asserted to the last, that\r\nalthough he made repeated applications to the Government for recompense,\r\nhe having imperilled his own life to save that of Her Majesty, all he\r\never received for his pains was permission to display the royal arms on\r\nhis house front.\r\n\r\nThe WOODMAN is another very common sign, invariably representing the\r\nsame woodman copied from Barker’s picture, and evidently suggested by\r\nCowper’s charming description of a winter’s morning in the “Task.” The\r\nDROVER’S CALL is still seen on many roadsides, though the profession\r\nthat gave rise to it is well-nigh extinct; the herds of steaming,\r\nfierce-looking oxen, formerly driven from all parts of the kingdom,\r\nalong the main roads leading to London, there to be devoured, being now\r\nnearly all sent here by rail. A yet older practice produced the sign of\r\nthe STRING OF HORSES, which may still be seen on many a highroad in the\r\nNorth, and dates from times before mail coaches and stage waggons\r\nexisted, when all the goods-traffic inland had to be performed by\r\nstrings of packhorses, who carried large baskets, hampers, and bales\r\nslung across their backs, and _slowly_, though far from _surely_, wound\r\ntheir way over miles and miles of uninhabited tracts, moors, and fens,\r\nwhich lay between the small towns and straggling villages.\r\n\r\nMany signs still recall those bygone days: the OLD COACH AND SIX may yet\r\nbe seen in some places. There is one, for instance, in Westminster, but\r\nit is no longer a “sign of the times,” for alas!--\r\n\r\n  “No more the coaches shall I see\r\n  Come trundling from the yard,\r\n  Nor hear the horn blown cheerily\r\n  By brandy-bibbing guard.”\r\n\r\nThe names of the coaches were often adopted by inns on the road; for\r\ninstance, the MAIL, the TELEGRAPH, the DEFIANCE, the BALLOON, the\r\nTALLY-HO, the BANG-UP, the EXPRESS, &c., &c.; but alas! the modern\r\nrailroad has swept away the signs as well as the coaches.\r\n\r\nIn London, there are not less than fifty-two public-houses known as the\r\nCOACH AND HORSES, exclusive of beer-houses, coffee-houses, and similar\r\nestablishments. Stow says, in his “Summary of English Chronicles,” that\r\nin 1555, Walter Ripon made a coach for the Earl of Rutland, “which was\r\nthe first that was ever used in England.” But in his larger Chronicle he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  “In the year 1564 Guilliam Boonen, a Dutchman, became the queen’s\r\n  coachman, and was the first that brought the use of coaches into\r\n  England. After a while divers great ladies, with as great jalousy of\r\n  the queen’s displeasure, made them coaches, and rid up and down the\r\n  country in them, to the great admiration of all the beholders, but\r\n  then by little they grew usual among the nobility and others of sort,\r\n  and within twenty years became a great trade of coachmaking.”\r\n\r\nTaylor the Water poet, who, as a waterman of course, bore a grudge to\r\ncoaches, said, “It is a doubtful question whether the devil brought\r\n_tobacco_ into England in a _coach_, for both appeared at the same\r\ntime.” How common they became in a short time appears from all the\r\nsatirists of that period; not only the nobility, but even the citizens\r\ncould no longer do without them, after they were once introduced. Not\r\nforty years after their first appearance Pierce Pennyless, speaking of\r\nmerchants’ wives, says: “She will not go unto the field to coure on the\r\ngreen grasse, but she must have a coach for her convoy.”[516] No wonder,\r\nthen, that, according to the “Coach and Sedan,” a pamphlet of 1636,\r\nthere were then in London, the suburbs, and four miles’ compass without,\r\ncoaches to the number of 6000 and odd. These were nearly all private\r\ncarriages, for the hackney coaches were only established in 1625 by one\r\nCaptain Bailey. Their first stand was at the Maypole in the Strand. They\r\nnumbered about twenty, and were attached to the principal inns. In 1636,\r\nthe number of hackney coaches was confined to 50; in 1652, to 200; in\r\n1654, to 300; in 1662, to 400; in 1694, to 700; in 1710, to 800; in\r\n1771, to 1000; in 1802, to 1100; but in 1833 all limitation of number\r\nceased. Besides cabs of various kinds, there are now above a thousand\r\nomnibusses regularly employed in the Metropolis, and the commissioners\r\nof stamps are authorised to license all such carriages _without\r\nlimitation as to number_; the proprietor paying the duty of £5 for the\r\nlicence, and 10s. per week during its continuance. What a difference\r\njust two centuries ago, when by proclamation of the “Merry Monarch:”--\r\n\r\n  “The excessive number of hackney coaches [about 400] and coach horses\r\n  in London, are found to be a common nuisance to the public damage of\r\n  our people, by reason of their rude and disorderly standing, and\r\n  passing to and fro, in and about our cities and suburbs; the streets\r\n  and highways being thereof pestered and much impassable, the pavement\r\n  broken up, and the common passages obstructed and made dangerous.”\r\n  Hence orders are given, that “henceforth none shall stand in the\r\n  street, but only within their coach-houses, stables, and yards.”\r\n\r\nAt the Coach and Horses, Bartholomew Close, some vestiges of the ancient\r\nbuildings of St Bartholomew’s Hospital and Convent still remain--viz., a\r\nclustered column in the beer cellar, walls of immense thickness, and an\r\nearly English window in the taproom, &c. This building occupies the site\r\nof the north cloister.[517] Another Coach and Horses, in Ray Street,\r\nClerkenwell, is also built on classic ground, for it occupies the site\r\nof the once famous Hockley-in-the-Hole of bear-baiting memory. A comical\r\nalehouse keeper in Oswestry has travestied the sign of the Coach and\r\nHorses into the COACH AND DOGS.\r\n\r\nThe WHEEL, an object sometimes seen on signboards, may have been derived\r\nfrom the CATHERINE WHEEL, (the name of a favourite old coaching inn in\r\nBishopsgate Street,) or from the wheel of fortune; the SADDLE and the\r\nSPUR are both very general on roadside inns, owing to the ancient mode\r\nof travelling on horseback; the WHIP occurs in Briggate, Leeds.\r\n\r\nIn Norwich there was (and we believe is still) a curious combination,\r\nthe WHIP AND EGG, which existed in that locality as early as the year\r\n1750,[518] and which is enumerated in London, under the name of the WHIP\r\nAND EGGSHELL, amongst the taverns in the black letter ballad of\r\n“London’s Ordinarie, or Everie Man in his Humour,” whilst a still\r\nearlier mention occurs in Mother Bunch’s Merriment, (1604,) when the\r\ntransformation of pigs into fowls, whereby one of the gulls was so\r\n“sweetly deceyved,” is laid at the Whip and Eggshell. It has been\r\nexplained as a corruption of the Whip and Nag, but the combination of\r\nthese two would be so obvious that a corruption would scarcely be\r\npossible. In “Great Britain’s Wonder, or London’s Admiration,” a ballad\r\non the frost of 1685, when the Thames was frozen over, and a fair held\r\nupon it, the following lines occur:--\r\n\r\n  “In this same street, before the Temple made,[519]\r\n  There seems to be a brisk and lively trade,\r\n  When ev’ry booth hath such a cunning sign\r\n  As seldom hath been seen in former time;\r\n  The FLYING P---- POT is one of the same,\r\n  The WHIP AND EGGSHELL, and the BROOM by name.”\r\n\r\nThe Whip and Egg, therefore, figured on the ice, and may have been\r\nbrought together from the _whipping_ of _eggs_, in making egg-punch,\r\negg-flip, and similar beverages, much drunk on the ice in Holland; and\r\nas there were always crowds of Dutchmen on the ice, whenever the river\r\nwas frozen over, they may have introduced their favourite drink as well\r\nas their Dutch whirlings, whimsies, and flying boats, and the sign have\r\nbeen invented in order to indicate the sale of those liquors.\r\n\r\nThe THREE JOLLY BUTCHERS used to be seen in the neighbourhood of markets\r\nand shambles, either in allusion to the three merry north-country\r\nbutchers, who killed nine highwaymen, according to the ballad, or simply\r\nthat favourite combination of three which is of such frequent\r\nrecurrence. The CLEAVER seems also to be in compliment to this\r\nprofession, as well as the MARROWBONES AND CLEAVER. This last is a sign\r\nin Fetter Lane, originating from a custom, now rapidly dying away, of\r\nthe butcher boys serenading newly married couples with these\r\nprofessional instruments. Formerly, the band would consist of four\r\ncleavers, each of a different tone, or, if complete, of eight, and by\r\nbeating their marrowbones skilfully against these, they obtained a sort\r\nof music somewhat after the fashion of indifferent bell-ringing. When\r\nwell performed, however, and heard from a proper distance, it was not\r\naltogether unpleasant. A largesse of half-a-crown or a crown was\r\ngenerally expected for this delicate attention. The butchers of Clare\r\nmarket had the reputation of being the best performers. The last public\r\nappearance of this popular music was at the marriage of the Prince of\r\nWales, when small bands of them perambulated the town, playing “God Save\r\nthe Queen.” This music was once so common that Tom Killigrew called it\r\nthe national instrument of England. In 1759 a burlesque Ode on St\r\nCecilia’s day, written by Bonnell Thornton, was performed at Ranelagh.\r\nAmongst the instruments employed in this there was a band of marrowbones\r\nand cleavers, whose endeavours were admitted by the _cognoscenti_ to\r\nhave been “a complete success.”\r\n\r\nAs the use of coaches gave rise to the sign of the Coach and Horses, so\r\nthe Sedan produced some signs, as the SEDAN CHAIR, Broad Quay, Bristol;\r\nNorth Searle, Newark; the TWO CHAIRMEN, &c., Warwick Street, Cockspur\r\nStreet, and other parts of London; and the THREE CHAIRS in the\r\nseventeenth century, a famous tavern in the Little Piazza, Covent\r\nGarden. The Sedan, says Randle Holme, “is a thing in which sick and\r\ncrazy persons are carried abroad, which is borne up by the staves by two\r\nlusty men.”[520] The first sedan chair used in England was one that the\r\nDuke of Buckingham had received as a gift from Charles I., when Prince\r\nof Wales, on his return from that romantic “Jean-de-Paris” expedition to\r\nSpain.[521] The use of it got the Duke into trouble, and he was accused\r\nof “degrading Englishmen into slaves and beasts of burden.” Lysons, in\r\nhis “Magna Britannia,” gives another origin for them; speaking of\r\nDuncombe at Battlesden, in Bedfordshire, he says:--\r\n\r\n  “It was to one of this family, Sir Saunders Duncombe, a gentleman\r\n  pensioner to King James and Charles I., that we are indebted for the\r\n  accommodation of the sedans or close chairs, the use of which was\r\n  first introduced by him in this country in the year 1634, when he\r\n  procured a patent which vested in him and his heirs the sole right of\r\n  carrying persons up and down in them for a certain time.”\r\n\r\nSir Saunders hereupon got forty or fifty sedans made, and sent them\r\nabout town, but differences soon arose between the chairmen and the\r\ncoachmen. Pamphlets were written,[522] ballads were sung on the\r\noccasion, and the public sided with one or the other, according to\r\nindividual taste. A ballad in favour of the sedan said:--\r\n\r\n  “I love sedans, cause they do plod\r\n    And amble everywhere,\r\n  Which prancers are with leather shod,\r\n    And neere disturb the care.\r\n  Heigh downe, dery, dery, downe,\r\n  With the hackney coaches downe,\r\n    Their jumpings make\r\n    The pavement shake,\r\n  Their noyse doth mad the towne.”[523]\r\n\r\nDe Foe, in 1702, says, “We are carried to these places [coffee-houses]\r\nin chairs, which are here very cheap--a guinea a week, or a shilling per\r\nhour--and your chairmen serve you for porters to run on errands, as your\r\ngondoliers do at Venice.” The chairmen of the aristocracy wore gaudy\r\nliveries and plumed hats, and their chairs were richly gilt and painted,\r\nand provided with velvet cushions. They used to be kept in the halls of\r\ntheir large mansions. As for the chairmen, we may infer from Gay’s\r\n“Trivia” that they were an insolent set of fellows:--\r\n\r\n  “Let not the chairman with assuming stride\r\n  Press near the wall and rudely thrust thy side,\r\n  The laws have set him bounds; his servile feet\r\n  Should ne’er encroach where posts defend the street.\r\n  Yet, who the footman’s arrogance can quell,\r\n  Whose flambeau gilds the sashes of Pall Mall,\r\n  When in long rank a train of torches flame,\r\n  To light the midnight visits of the dame.”\r\n\r\nThe trumpet-like instruments in which these torches were extinguished,\r\nwhen arrived at their place of destination, are still seen attached to\r\nthe area railings of most of the houses in Grosvenor and St James’\r\nSquares, and various other parts of the town fashionably inhabited at\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\nAnother creature of this class, now as completely extinct as the\r\nPlesiosaurus and the Megatherion, or any other monster of the\r\npre-Adamite world, was the RUNNING FOOTMAN. We cannot say that there is\r\nnot a “sign” of him left, for there is one in Charles Street, Berkeley\r\nSquare, representing a man in gaudy attire, running, with a long cane in\r\nhis hand--under it, “I AM THE ONLY RUNNING FOOTMAN.” This was a class of\r\nservants used by rich families in former days to run before the\r\ncarriage, to clear the way, bear torches at night, pay turnpikes, and\r\nserving also in a great measure for pomp. Generally their livery was\r\nvery rich, being somewhat of the Jockey dress, with a silk sash round\r\nthe waist; sometimes, instead of breeches, they wore a sort of silk\r\npetticoat with a deep gold fringe. They carried long sticks with silver\r\nheads, which have now descended to their successors the footmen. The\r\nDuke of Queensberry was one of the last noblemen who kept running\r\nfootmen. A good story is told of him in connexion with one of these\r\nservants. Whenever his grace wanted to engage one it was his custom to\r\nmake him put on his livery and run up and down Piccadilly, whilst he,\r\nfrom his balcony, watched their paces; and so it happened on a time,\r\nthat after one of those fellows had gone through all his evolutions and\r\npresented himself under the balcony, the Duke said: “That will do; you\r\nwill suit me very well.” “And so your livery does me,” was the answer,\r\nand off the fellow went running like a deer and was never heard of\r\nafterwards. Another feat on record, somewhat more to the credit of the\r\nfraternity, was that one of them ran for a wager to Windsor against the\r\nDuke of Marlborough in a phaeton with four horses, and lost only by a\r\nshort distance; but it cost the poor fellow his life, for he died very\r\nsoon after. Most of these running footmen were Irish, hence Decker[524]\r\nsays--“The Devil’s footeman was very nimble of his heeles, for no wild\r\nIrishman could outrunne him,” and Brathwaite remarks:--\r\n\r\n  “For see those thin-breech’d Irish lackies run.”[525]\r\n\r\nSt Patrick’s day was generally given to them as a holiday, which they\r\ninvariably celebrated by purging themselves. In various country places\r\nthe sign of the Running Footman has been corrupted into the RUNNING MAN.\r\n\r\nAnother “domestic” sign is the TRUSTY SERVANT at Minstead, Hants:--\r\n\r\n  “A trusty servant’s portrait would you see,\r\n  This emblematic figure well survey;\r\n  The porker’s snout not nice in diet shows,\r\n  The padlock shut, no secret he’ll disclose.\r\n  Patient the ass his master’s rage will bear,\r\n  Swiftness in errand the stag’s feet declare.\r\n  Loaden his left hand apt to labour saith,\r\n  The vest his neatness: open hand his faith.\r\n  Girt with his sword, his shield upon his arm,\r\n  Himself and master he’ll protect from harm.”\r\n\r\nThe origin of this sign is a picture on the wall of one of the rooms,\r\nnear the kitchen of Winchester College, where it is accompanied by the\r\nabove verses in English and Latin.\r\n\r\nFurther, there is the STAVE-PORTER, Dockhead, London; the TICKET-PORTER,\r\nnear London Bridge; the PORTER’S LODGE, Leicester; and the PORTER AND\r\nGENTLEMAN in three different places in London.\r\n\r\nThe HUNTSMAN is common in the hunting districts. To the hunt, also, we\r\nmust refer such signs as--HARK TO BOUNTY, Staidburn, Clitheroe; HARK UP\r\nTO NUDGER, Dobcross, Manchester; HARK THE LASHER, near Castleton, Derby;\r\nHARK UP TO GLORY, Rochdale, and the CHASE INN in Leamington. In\r\nCambridge there are two signs of the BIRDBOLT, an implement formerly\r\nused to shoot birds; consequently it must be a sign of some antiquity.\r\nIn Nightingale Lane, East Smithfield, there is an EXPERIENCED FOWLER,\r\nwho, no doubt, well knows the value of “a bird in the hand,” and at\r\nOldham and Rochdale there is an equally satirical sign, that of the\r\nTRAP. The ANGLER is common enough in the neighbourhood of trout streams\r\nand other fishing resorts frequented by the disciples of Isaak Walton.\r\n\r\nMany professions are only represented by one or two objects relating to\r\nthem. The TALLOW CHANDLER, very common among the trades tokens, was\r\nalways represented by a man dipping candles. To that trade also seems to\r\nbelong the BOWLS AND CANDLE POLES, which occurs in the following\r\nrambling advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “STOLEN,\r\n  _Lost_, or _Mislaid_,\r\n\r\n  A Promissory Note for one hundred and twenty Pounds, signed by John\r\n  Smallwood and indorsed by John Addams. Whoever will bring the same\r\n  note to the House known by the Bowls and Candlepoles in Duke Street,\r\n  in the Park, Southwark, shall receive five Guineas Reward; and if\r\n  offered to be paid away or any Writ to be taken out for payment of the\r\n  said Note, pray stop it and the party, and you shall have the same\r\n  Reward.\r\n\r\n  ⁂ THE HOUSE is in Tenements, and some part thereof being a\r\n  Pawnbroker’s, was broke open and several things of value missing.\r\n  Note, This mischief arrises from a country Butcher, who did strike and\r\n  kick an old Gentleman at London Bridge, about three quarters of a year\r\n  ago. And all persons who did see the said Assault and will speak the\r\n  truth, (for Christ’s sake,) are desired to send their Names and Place\r\n  of Abode to the Bowls and Candlepoles and the favour shall be\r\n  thankfully acknowledged.”[526]\r\n\r\nThe SCALES is a common sign referring to various trades: one of the\r\nengraved bill-heads in the Bagford Collection gives the HAND AND\r\nSCALES--viz., a hand holding a pair of scales; this antiquated mode of\r\nrepresenting a hand issuing from the clouds to perform some action, has\r\ngiven name to a great many signs--all combinations of the hand with some\r\nother object. The SPINNING WHEEL was formerly much more common than now;\r\nthere is still a public-house with this sign at Hamsterley near\r\nDarlington. The WOOLSACK was originally a wool-merchant’s sign; it is\r\noften accompanied by the Black Boy. Machyn mentions this sign in 1555:\r\n“The xx day of July was cared to the Toure in the morning erlee iiij\r\nmen; on was the goodman of the Volsake with-owt Algatt.” It seems to\r\nhave been one of the leading taverns in Ben Jonson’s time, who often\r\nalludes to it in his plays; like the Dagger, it was famous for its pies.\r\n\r\n  “And see how the factors and prentices play there\r\n  False with their masters, and geld many a full pack,\r\n  To spend it in pies at the Dagger and the _Woolpack_.”\r\n\r\n  _The Devil is an Ass_, act i., sc. 1.\r\n\r\n  “Her Grace would have you eat no more _Woolsack_ pies nor Dagger\r\n  furmety.”--_Alchymist_, act v., sc. 2.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1682, the Woolsack Tavern in Newgate Market attracted great\r\nattention, owing to a wonderful phenomenon there exhibited, and set\r\nforth in the following handbill from the Sloane Collection, No. 958:--\r\n\r\n  “At the sign of the Woolpack in _Newgate Street_, is to be seen a\r\n  strange and wonderful thing, which is, an elm-board, being touch’d\r\n  with a hot iron, doth express itself, as if it was a man dying, with\r\n  grones and trembling, to the great admiration of all the hearers. It\r\n  has been presented before the King and his nobles, and hath given them\r\n  great satisfaction. _Vivat Rex._”\r\n\r\nSuch a curiosity could not fail to prove an object of immense attraction\r\nwith our wonder-loving ancestors, particularly after the house had been\r\nvisited by his Majesty, and thus acquired additional respectability.\r\nVery soon, however, numerous London taverns claimed public attention for\r\nsimilar wonders. It was as if the wood used in their construction had\r\nbeen cut from the myrtle-tree which conversed with Æneas near the river\r\nHebrus, (“Æneid,” lib. iii. 19,) or from the “fiera selvaggia” Dante saw\r\nin the second circle of Hades, where he\r\n\r\n    “sentia da ogni parte tragger guai\r\n  E non vedea persona che’l facesse.”[527]\r\n\r\n  _Inferno_, canto xiii.\r\n\r\nThe mantel-piece at the BOWMAN TAVERN, Drury Lane, expressed its\r\naversion of a red hot poker as unequivocally as the elm-board at the\r\nWoolsack, and the dresser at the Queen’s Arms in St Martin’s Lane was\r\nevidently a “chip of the same block.” Indeed, boards were cauterised and\r\ngroaned all over London.\r\n\r\nThe BLOCK was a hatter’s sign, or as that trade was sometimes called,\r\n_Bever-cutter_, the block being the mould on which the hat is formed.\r\nBeatrix, in “Much Ado about Nothing,” says: “He wears his faith, but as\r\nthe fashion of his hat it ever changes with the next block.” And Decker,\r\nin the “Gull’s Hornbook:” “John, in Paul’s Churchyard, shall fit his\r\nhead for an excellent block.” The word was also often used as a synonym\r\nfor “hat.”\r\n\r\nThe POSTBOY was the sign of a fishmonger’s shop in Sherborne Lane, where\r\nin 1759 Green-native Colchester oysters were sold at 3s. 3d. a barrel,\r\nand exceeding fine “Pyfleet oysters” at 4s. 3d. a barrel. The UP AND\r\nDOWN POST used to be, in the good old coaching times, a thriving inn on\r\nthe now deserted highway between Birmingham and Coventry. The picture\r\nrepresented an erect and a prostrate pillar, which after all was only a\r\nrebus or a misunderstanding. In former times, before the mail-coaches\r\nwere instituted, the equestrian letter-carriers of the _up and down\r\nmail_ used to meet at this house, exchange their bags and each return\r\nwhence they came, thus effecting a considerable saving of time and\r\ntrouble. Even washerwomen have been exalted to the signboard, for in\r\nNorwich there was the sign of the THREE WASHERWOMEN in 1750. And one of\r\nthe implements of their trade, the GOLDEN MAID, (better known as “the\r\nDolly,”) may still be seen at a turner’s shop in Dudley.\r\n\r\nA few others remain, which cannot, strictly speaking, be called\r\nprofessions, yet are they--or at least they were--means of making a\r\nliving, as the THREE MORRIS-DANCERS, once a very common sign, but now,\r\nlike the custom that gave rise to it, almost extinct. There is one still\r\nleft, however, at Scarisbrook, Lancashire, and in a few villages a\r\nremnant of the dance is also kept up on certain occasions. They were\r\ncalled Morris, or Moors, from the Spanish _Morisco_. Black faces were\r\nrequired for the dance:--\r\n\r\n  “Nam faciem plerumque inficiunt fuligine et peregrinum vestium cultum\r\n  assumunt, qui ludicris talibus indulgent ut Mauriesse videantur, aut e\r\n  longius remota patria credantur advolasse atque insolens recreationis\r\n  genus advenisse.”[528]\r\n\r\nThere is a painted glass window at Betley, in Staffordshire, on which\r\nthe characters performing the dance in the early part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury are represented; to these afterwards others were added. The\r\nearliest performers appear to have been called Robin Hood and Little\r\nJohn, Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, the May queen, the fool, the piper, and\r\nthe plain rank and file of dancers variously dressed. To these\r\nafterwards were added a dragon, a hobby-horse, and other quaint types.\r\nAmong the characters represented on the painted window are also a\r\nfranklein, a churl, or peasant, and a nobleman. The hobby-horseman\r\noccupies the middle of the window, and is said to represent a Moorish\r\nking: he has two swords thrust into his cheeks, which seem to represent\r\na feat of dexterity performed by Indian and Egyptian jugglers of\r\nthrowing a somersault with two swords balanced on each side of the\r\ncheek. The horse (merely a frame covered with long trappings, and only\r\nshowing the neck and limbs of a horse, in which the man capered about)\r\nheld a ladle in his mouth for collecting money.\r\n\r\nThe fool was one of the features of the pageant, and on him rested a\r\ngreat deal of the duties to amuse the public, particularly when the\r\nhobby-horse was not present; hence Ben Jonson:--\r\n\r\n  “But see the Hobby-Horse is forgot,\r\n  Fool, it must be your lot\r\n  To supply your wont with faces\r\n  And some other buffoon graces.\r\n            You know how.”\r\n\r\nOn May-day, which in those merry days was the merriest of all the year,\r\nthey came out in full force, and, along with the milkmaids dancing with\r\npiles of plate on their heads, contributed not a little to give the\r\nstreets and thoroughfares a merry aspect. The May-dance of the sweeps is\r\nperhaps the “last stage of decomposition” of this amusement of our\r\nforefathers; their sooty complexions, their clowns, their Lord and Lady\r\nand Jack in the Green, may be all that remain of the morris-dance, the\r\nfool, the Lord and Lady, the hobby-horse, and the rest.\r\n\r\nIn treating of games, we may advert to a rendering of the FLYING HORSE,\r\noverlooked on a former occasion. Besides its mythological and heraldic\r\norigin, there was another reason which sometimes prompted the choice of\r\nthis sign. It was the name of a popular amusement, which consisted in a\r\nswing, the seat of which formed a wooden horse. This the flying\r\nequestrian mounted, and as he was swinging to and fro he had to take\r\nwith a sword the ring off a quintain. If he succeeded, his adroitness\r\nwas no doubt rewarded either with a number of swings gratis, or a\r\n_quotum_ of beer. Such a Flying Horse served for a sign to an ale-house\r\nof that denomination in Moorfields, in the time of Queen Anne. Swings,\r\nround-abouts, and such-like amusements, were in those days the usual\r\nappendages of suburban ale-houses, and to a certain extent have even\r\ncome down to our time.\r\n\r\nOil and colour-shops generally, and some public-houses--mostly near\r\ntheatres--adopt the sign of the HARLEQUIN. One of the most noted amongst\r\nthe latter was kept in the beginning of this century in Drury Lane, by\r\nthe eccentric Richardson, the showman, or, rather, the “Prince of\r\nShowmen,” as he called himself. In this tavern he saved some money,\r\nwhich enabled him to fit up a travelling theatre, by which he realised\r\nso much, that when he died in 1836, he left £20,000. It used to be one\r\nof his boasts that he had brought out Edmund Kean, and several other\r\neminent actors. He desired in his will to be buried at Marlow, in Bucks,\r\n(where he was born in the workhouse,) in the same grave with the\r\n“Spotted Boy,” a natural phenomenon which had been one of his luckiest\r\nhits, and brought him a considerable amount of money.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe how the same simple thing has made mankind\r\nlaugh for nearly thirty centuries, and that is a black face. In our age\r\na large proportion of the public seem to find inexhaustible pleasure in\r\npseudo-negroes, their songs and antics. The Greeks on their stage had a\r\nyoung satyr, dressed in goat or tiger-skin, with a short stick in his\r\nhand, _a white hat on his head, his hair cut short, and a brown mask_.\r\nThis satyr performed some antics, and was the prototype of the\r\nharlequin. The Romans adopted a somewhat similar character under the\r\nname of _planipes_, because he did not wear the tragic cothurna; he also\r\nwore a variegated dress, for Apuleius, in his “Apology,” speaks of the\r\n“mimus centunculus.” From the Romans it descended to the Italians, and\r\nas early as the sixteenth century we find the whole troop complete,\r\nplaying in Spain, namely, Harlequin, Pantaloon, Pagliacico, the Doctor,\r\n&c. At a masked ball at the court of Charles IX., in 1572, the king\r\nrepresented Brighella; the Cardinal of Lorraine, Pantaloon; Catherine de\r\nMedici, Columbine; and the Duke of Anjou, (afterwards Henry III.,)\r\nHarlequin. At that time, or shortly after, the troop of the Gelosi\r\nplayed the Italian pieces in Paris, in which these characters were\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nFor the sign of the GREEN MAN there is a twofold explanation. 1^{o}.\r\nThat it represents the green, wild, or wood men of the shows and\r\npageants, such as described by Machyn in his Diary on Lord Mayor’s Day,\r\nOctober 29, 1553:--“Then cam ij grett wodyn with ij grett clubes all in\r\ngrene and with skwybes [squibs] bornyng . . . . with gret berds and ryd\r\nhere and ij targets a-pon their bake.” This green in which they were\r\ndressed consisted of green leaves. When Queen Elizabeth was at\r\nKenilworth Castle, in 1575, “on the x of Julee met her in the Forest as\r\nshe came from hunting one clad like a savage man all in ivie,”[529] who\r\nmade a very neat speech to the queen, in which he was kindly assisted by\r\nthe echo. Besides wielding sticks with crackers in pageants, these green\r\nmen sometimes fought with each other, attacked castles and dragons, and\r\nwere altogether a very favourite popular character with the public. One\r\nof their duties seems to have been to clear the way for processions. In\r\none of the Harleian MSS., entitled “The maner of the showe, that is, if\r\nGod spare life and health, shall be seen by all the behoulders upon St\r\nGeorges Day next, being the 23 of Aprill, 1610,” we see amongst the\r\nrequirements:--\r\n\r\n  “It. ij men in greene leaves set with work upon their other habet with\r\n  black heare & black beards very owgly to behould, and garlands upon\r\n  their heads with great clubs in their hands with fireworks to scatter\r\n  abroad to maintaine way for the rest of the show.”[530]\r\n\r\nThis interpretation is also given as the origin of the Green Man by\r\nBagford:--\r\n\r\n  “They are called woudmen, or wildmen, thou’ at thes day we in ye signe\r\n  call them Green Men, couered with grene bones: and are used for singes\r\n  by stillers of strong watters and if I mistake not are y^{e}\r\n  sopourters of y^{e} king of Deanmarks armes at thes day; and I am abpt\r\n  to beleve that y^{e} Daynes learned us hear in England the use of\r\n  those tosticatein lickers [intoxicating] as well as y^{e} breweing of\r\n  Aele and a fit emblem for those that use that intosticating licker\r\n  which berefts them of their sennes.”[531]\r\n\r\nThe WILD MAN, therefore, on a sign at Quarry Hill, Ladybridge, Leeds, is\r\nthe same as the Green Man.\r\n\r\n2^{o}. The second version of this sign is, that it is intended for a\r\nforester, and in that garb the Green Man is now invariably represented;\r\neven as far back as the seventeenth century, it is evident from the\r\ntrades tokens that the Green Man was generally a forester, and, in many\r\ncases, Robin Hood himself, which may be inferred from the small figure\r\nfrequently introduced beside him, and meant for Little John. The ballads\r\nalways described Robin and his merry men as dressed in green, “Lincoln\r\ngreen.” When Robin meets the page who brings him presents from Queen\r\nKatherine:--\r\n\r\n  “Robin took his mantle from his backe,\r\n  It was of the _Lincoln greene_\r\n  And sent that by this lovely page\r\n  For a present unto the queene.”[532]\r\n\r\nAnd in the same ballad, when he is going to court, “he clothed his men\r\nin _Lincolne greene_,” &c. Drayton, in his “Polyolbion,” says:--\r\n\r\n  “An hundred valiant men had this brave Robin Hood\r\n  Still ready at his call, that bowmen were right good,\r\n  _All clad in Lincoln green_ which caps of red and blue.”\r\n\r\nSometimes it is called Kendal green:--\r\n\r\n                             “All the woods\r\n  Are full of outlaws, that in _Kendal green_\r\n  Follow the outlawed Earl of Huntingdon.”\r\n\r\n  Richard, Earl of Huntingdon, 1601, (_i.e._, Robin Hood)\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, the ordinary dress of foresters and woodmen, and is so\r\nstill in Germany.\r\n\r\n  “All in a woodman’s jacket he was clad,\r\n  Of _Lincoln Green_, belayed with silver lace.”\r\n\r\n  SPENSER’S _Faery Queene_.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted Green Man taverns was that on Stroud Green,\r\nIslington, formerly the residence of Sir Th. Stapleton, of Gray’s Court,\r\nBart., whose initials, with those of his wife, and the date 1609, were\r\nto be seen on the façade. It was one of the suburban retreats frequented\r\nby the fashion in the days of Charles I., when it had been converted\r\ninto a tavern. A century ago the sign bore the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Ye are wellcome all\r\n  To Stapleton Hall.”\r\n\r\nA club used to meet annually at this place, styling themselves the Lord\r\nMayor, Aldermen, and Corporation of Stroud Green.[533] At Dulwich, in\r\nthe reign of George II., there was another Green Man, a place of\r\namusement for the Londoners during the summer season; it is enumerated,\r\nwith other similar resorts, in the following stanza:--\r\n\r\n  “That Vauxhall and Ruckholt and Ranelagh too,\r\n  And Hoxton and Sadlers both Old and New,\r\n  My Lord Cobham’s Head and the Dulwich Green Man\r\n  May make as much pastime as ever they can.[534]\r\n                                Derry Down,” &c.\r\n\r\n  _Musick in Good Time, a new Ballad_, 1745.\r\n\r\nThe MERRY ANDREW was a card-maker’s sign; in the Banks Collection there\r\nis a shopbill of the time of Queen Anne, of Edward Hall, card-maker to\r\nher Majesty at the Merry Andrew, in Piccadilly. The playing-cards at\r\nthat time used to have certain heads on the wrapper, according to which\r\nthey were denominated. Merry Andrew was one of them. Other sorts had the\r\nGreat Mogul, Henry VII., Henry VIII., and the Duke of Savoy, (Prince\r\nEugene;) second-class cards had the Queen of Hungary, the Spaniard, the\r\nbeau, and the Merry Andrew. The original Merry Andrew is said to have\r\nbeen a certain Doctor Andrew Borde, born at Pevensey in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford, but who\r\nobtained his doctor’s degree at Montpellier. His writings abound with\r\nwitticisms, which are reported also to have pervaded his speech. He is\r\nsaid to have frequented fairs, markets, and other “busy haunts of men,”\r\nharanguing the people in order to increase his practice in physic. He\r\nhad many followers and imitators, whence it came that those who affected\r\nthe same language and gestures were called Merry Andrews.\r\nNotwithstanding all this mirth and animal spirits, he professed himself\r\na Carthusian, lived in celibacy, drank water three days in the week,\r\nwore a hair shirt, and nightly hung his shroud at the foot of his bed.\r\nHe is said to have been physician to King Henry VIII., and member of the\r\nCollege of Physicians in London. He died a prisoner in the Fleet in\r\n1549. More celebrated than his works on physic are his “Merry Tales of\r\nthe Wise Men of Gotham,” and the “Merry History of the Miller of\r\nAbingdon.”\r\n\r\nLower down still in the sphere of callings and professions the signs\r\nwill take us. At Oswald Wistle, Accrington, we meet with the TINKER’S\r\nBUDGET. The budget is the tinker’s bag of instruments; we see the word\r\nthus used in Randle Holme:[535]--“A Tinker with his _budget_ on his\r\nback, having always in his mouth this merry cry:--‘Have you any work for\r\na Tinker?’” And Shakespeare, in the “Winter’s Tale:”\r\n\r\n  “If tinkers may have leave to live\r\n  And bear the sowskin _budget_.”\r\n\r\nThis inn, then, is certainly very modest in its pretensions; but we\r\nshall descend lower still. Even “poor Tom’s flock of wild geese,”\r\notherwise TOM OF BEDLAM, we have now to introduce. We find him at\r\nBalsall, Warwick, and no doubt it was formerly not an uncommon sign,\r\nsince he was such a favourite in ballads; the MERRY TOM, at Kirkcumbeck,\r\nCumberland, evidently refers to the same individual. Notwithstanding all\r\nthe fantastic ballads that went under Tom’s name, he was but a sorry\r\nrogue. Randle Holme[536] says:--\r\n\r\n  “The Sow gelder and Tom of Bedlam are both wandering knaves alike, and\r\n  such as are seldom or never out of their way, having their home in any\r\n  place. The first is described as carrying a long staff, with a head\r\n  like a spear or a half pike, and a horn hung by his side from a broad\r\n  leather belt or girdle cross his shoulders. Tom of Bedlam is in the\r\n  same garb, with a long staff, and a Cow or Ox Horn by his side, but\r\n  his cloathing is more fantastic or ridiculous, for being a mad man he\r\n  is madly decked and dressed all over with Rubins, Feathers, cuttings\r\n  of cloth and what not; to make him seem a madman or one distracted,\r\n  when he is no other but a dissembling knave.”\r\n\r\n“The Canting Academy,” 1674, gives them a similar attire and\r\ncharacter:--\r\n\r\n  “Abram-men, otherwise called Tom of Bedlams; they are very strangely\r\n  and antickly garbed, with several coloured ribands or tape in their\r\n  hats, it may be instead of a feather, a fox tail hanging down a long\r\n  stick, with ribands streaming and the like; yet for all their seeming\r\n  madness they have wit enough to steal as they go.”[537]\r\n\r\nAubrey says:--\r\n\r\n  “Before the Civil Warre, I remember Tom o’ Bedlams went about a\r\n  begging. They had been such as had been in Bedlam and there recovered\r\n  and come to some degree of soberness, and when they were licensed to\r\n  goe out they had on their left arme an armilla of tinne (printed)\r\n  about three inches breadth, which was sodered on.”[538]\r\n\r\nThis permission, if ever it was granted, was retracted after the\r\nRestoration, for in the year 1675 the _London Gazette_ contained in\r\nseveral numbers the following advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “Whereas several Vagrant Persons do wander about the city of London\r\n  and countries, pretending themselves to be Lunaticks under cure in the\r\n  Hospitall of Bethlem, commonly called Bedlam, with brass plates upon\r\n  their arms and inscriptions thereon, These are to give notice that\r\n  there is no such liberty given to any Patients kept in the Hospital\r\n  for their cure, neither is any such plate as a distinction or mark put\r\n  upon any Lunatick during their being there or when discharged thence.\r\n  And that the same is a false pretence to colour their wandering and\r\n  begging and deceive the people to the dishonour of the Government of\r\n  that Hospital.”\r\n\r\nNot only men but also women of a roving disposition, adopted poor Tom’s\r\nhorn, and went wandering, begging, and pilfering under the name of BESS\r\nOF BEDLAM, which is still seen as a sign in Oak Street, Norwich. Bess\r\nwas an old companion of poor Tom, for in the play of King Lear, Tom\r\nsings a snatch of a song with the words, “Come over the bourn, Bessy, to\r\nme,” and in the jollities of Plough Monday the fool and Bessy are two\r\nof the principal personages.[539]\r\n\r\nA third class of beggars called _Mumpers_, is also found on the\r\nsignboard under the name of the THREE MUMPERS.\r\n\r\nThus, after having gone through all ranks of society, from the palace to\r\nthe cottage, and from the sceptre to Tom’s staff with a fox-tail, we now\r\ncome to the great leveller Death, who also was represented on the\r\nsignboard. There were the THREE DEATH’S-HEADS in Wapping, of which house\r\ntrades tokens are extant; probably it was an apothecary’s, though it was\r\na ghastly sign for his customers. Undertakers were also strictly\r\nprofessional in their choice. In the eighteenth century there were the\r\nFOUR COFFINS over against Somerset House,[540] and another in Fleet\r\nStreet, the sign of Stephen Roome,[541] whose son was the unfortunate\r\nauthor whom Pope has “gibbeted” in the Dunciad, as afflicted with a\r\n“funereal frown.” Savage, one of Pope’s literary _sicarii_, calls Roome\r\n“a perfect town-author,”[542] and has drawn his portrait in “An Author\r\nto be let, by Iscariot Hackney:”--\r\n\r\n  “Had it not been more laudable for Mr Roome, the son of an undertaker,\r\n  to have borne a link and a mourning staff, in the long procession of a\r\n  funeral--or even been more decent in him to have sung psalms according\r\n  to education, in an Anabaptist meeting, than to have been altering the\r\n  _Jovial Crew or Merry Beggars_ into a wicked imitation of the Beggars’\r\n  Opera?”\r\n\r\nAnother undertaker, James Maddox, clerk and coffin-maker of St Olave’s,\r\nhad for a sign the SUGAR-LOAF AND THREE COFFINS. The addition of the\r\nsugar-loaf has, of course, nothing to do with his profession, for when\r\ndeath calls, the sweets of life are past. It was simply the sign of a\r\nformer tenant, suspended in front or fixed in the wall of the house.\r\nAlthough the undertakers of the present day do not display signs as of\r\nold, they advertise their calling quite as effectually. The men who in\r\ntheir handbills solicit us to try their “economic funerals,” or to test\r\none of their “three guinea respectable interments,--one trial only\r\nasked,” are commercial with the rest of the age, although we might wish\r\nthat they would force themselves a little less upon our attention. One\r\nundertaker recently hit upon what he deemed a brilliant method of\r\nadvertising his cheap funerals. He selected some good names from the\r\n“Court Guide,” and sent out hundreds of telegrams announcing the low\r\nprices at which a “body” could be interred. Some reached their\r\ndestination just as the lady or gentleman “body” was sitting down to\r\ndinner, others as the “parties” were dressing, or in the act of leaving\r\nhome; but although the scheme failed, the name of the undertaker and his\r\nprices were firmly fixed in people’s memories, and he received, instead\r\nof orders, numerous cautions not to telegraph in that way again.\r\n\r\nAn undertaker in Islington, some years ago, exhibited in his window some\r\npleasing artistic efforts of his children, which must have greatly\r\ncomforted the father. “Master A., aged 12 years,” had produced a\r\ngrinning skeleton, garnished with worms and cross-bones; and “Miss B.,\r\naged 10,” had painted in colours a section of a vault, with coffin\r\nheads, skulls, and sexton’s tools, neatly arranged right and left. The\r\ndrawings were framed and glazed, and parental pride had placed them in\r\nthe best spot in the windows.\r\n\r\n[444] Notes and Queries.\r\n\r\n[445] Roxburghe Ballads, iii., fol. 253.\r\n\r\n[446] Akerman’s Trades Tokens.\r\n\r\n[447] “Richardsoniana,” London, 1776, p. 159.\r\n\r\n[448] Preface to his “History of the World.”\r\n\r\n[449] Archæologia, ii., p. 169.

The regular phrase used to be “What do ye lack? What\r\ndo ye lack?” The French _dits_ and _fabliaux_ teem with allusions to\r\nthis custom. In the story of “Courtois d’Arras,”--a travesty of the\r\nprodigal son, in a thirteenth century garb--Courtois finds the host\r\nstanding at his door shouting, “Bon vin de Soissons à 6 deniers le lot.”\r\nAnd in a mediæval mystery, entitled “Li jus de S. Nicholas,” the\r\ninnkeeper roars out, “Céans il fait bon diner, céans il y a pain chaud\r\net harengs chauds et vin d’Auxerre à plein tonneau.” In “Les trois\r\nAveugles de Compiegne,” mine host thus addresses the thirsty\r\nwanderers:--\r\n\r\n  “Ci a bon vin fres et nouvel,\r\n  Ça d’Ancoire, ça de Soissons\r\n  Pain et char et vin et poissons,\r\n  Céens fet bon despendre argent,\r\n  Ostel i a à toute gent,\r\n  Céens fet moult bon heberger.”\r\n\r\nAnd in the “Debats et facétieuses rencontres de Gringalet et de Guillot\r\nGorgen son maistre,” the servant who had taken advantage of the host’s\r\ninvitation, excuses himself, saying, “Le tavernier a plus de tort que\r\nmoy, car passant devant sa porte, et luy étant assiz, (ainsi qu’ils sont\r\nordinairement), il me cria me disant: Vous plaist-il de dejeuner céans?\r\nIl y a de bon pain, de bon vin et de bonne viande.” This touting at\r\ntavern doors was still practised in the last century, as appears from\r\nthe following passage in Tom Brown:--“We were jogging forward into the\r\ncity, when our Indian cast his eyes upon one of his own complexion, at a\r\ncertain coffee-house which has the _Sun_ staring its sign in the face,\r\neven at midnight, when the moon is queen regent of the planets, and,\r\nbeing willing to be acquainted with his countryman, gravely inquired\r\nwhat province or kingdom of India he belonged to; but the sooty dog\r\ncould do nothing but grin, and show his teeth, and cry, _Coffee, sir,\r\ntea, will you please to walk in, sir; a fresh pot, upon my word_.”--TOM\r\nBROWN, vol iii., p. 17. Not only taverns but all sorts of shops kept\r\nthese barking advertisements at the door. The ballad of “London\r\nLyckpenny” enumerates a quantity of them. “What do you lack?” was the\r\nstereotype phrase. The “Buy, buy, what’ll you buy?” of the butchers, is\r\none of the last remains in London of this custom. At Greenwich, the\r\npractice of touting at the doors of the small coffee-houses is still\r\nkept up; and throughout the United States and Canada the custom of\r\nwaiting at steamboat wharves and railway termini, to catch passengers,\r\nand worry them with recommendations to this or that hotel, is\r\nunpleasantly prevalent. The touters there are known as hotel runners.\r\n\r\n[456] “Wine one pint for a pennie, and bread to drink it _was_ given\r\nfree in every tavern.”--Note by STOW.

Others painted\r\ntheir door-posts a particular colour, whence the origin of the\r\nwell-known BLUE POSTS. In still older times painted posts or poles in\r\nfront of the houses seem occasionally to have served as signs; to some\r\nsuch distinction, at least Caxton’s RED POLES, as mentioned in one of\r\nhis advertisements, seems to refer:--\r\n\r\n  “If it please ony man spirituel or temporel to bye our pyes of two or\r\n  thre comemoracio’s of salisburi use, emprynted after the form of this\r\n  prese’t letre whiche ben wel and truly correct, late hym come\r\n  Westmonester into the almonestrye at the REED PALE, and he shal have\r\n  them good and chepe:\r\n\r\n  Supplico stet cedula.”\r\n\r\nEven in the seventeenth century such a distinction was still\r\noccasionally used, as the GREEN PALES in Peter Street,\r\nWestminster;[543]--and Stukeley[544] speaks of Mr Brown’s garden at the\r\nGREEN POLES, where an urn was dug up lined with lead and filled with\r\nearth and bones. In Etheredge’s play “She Would if she Could,” the BLACK\r\nPOSTS in James Street are named, (Act i., sc. 1, 1703;) whilst the\r\nnewspapers in the beginning of the eighteenth century contain\r\nadvertisements stating that the mineral water from Hampstead Wells might\r\nbe obtained, at the rate of 3d. a flask, from the lessee of the wells,\r\nwho lived at the BLACK POSTS in King Street, near Guildhall.\r\n\r\nGARDEN-HOUSES, or Summer-houses, attached to a building, were also used\r\nto designate shops and residences, as appears from a trades token “at\r\nthe garden-house in Blackfriars,” and also from a newspaper\r\nadvertisement of 1679, where the garden-house in King Street, St Giles,\r\nis mentioned. Frequent allusions to these garden-houses are found in the\r\nold plays; they appear to have been similar in all intents and purposes\r\nto the _petites maisons_ of the profligate French nobility in the times\r\nof the Régence. Stubbe, in his “Anatomy of Abuses,” severely attacks\r\nthem:--\r\n\r\n  “In the suburbes of the citie they have gardens either paled or walled\r\n  round about very high, with their harbers and bowers fit for the\r\n  purpose; and lest they might be espied in those open places, they have\r\n  their banqueting houses, with galleries, turrets, and what not,\r\n  therein sumptuously erected, wherein they may, and doubtless do, many\r\n  of them, play the filthy persons.”\r\n\r\nThe young Rake in Shakespeare’s spurious play of the “London Prodigal,”\r\n(1604,) says to the lady:--\r\n\r\n  “Now, God thank you, sweet lady, if you have any friend, or a\r\n  garden-house where you may employ a poor gentleman as your friend, I\r\n  am yours to command in all sweet service.”\r\n\r\nAnd Corisca in Massinger’s “Bondsman,” (Act i., sc. 3):--\r\n\r\n  “And if need be I have a couch and banqueting-house in my orchard,\r\n  where many a man of honour has not scorned to spend an afternoon.”\r\n\r\nHe also alludes to it in the “City Madam.” A remnant of this custom is\r\nstill to be traced in a few country towns, (Sunderland for instance,)\r\nwhere the middle classes have little gardens, in the outskirts of the\r\ntown, with bowers and wooden summer-houses for tea-drinkings. In Holland\r\nthey still flourish; the family usually take tea in them, whilst\r\npaterfamilias placidly smokes his pipe and listens to the croaking of\r\nthe frogs and the lowing of the cows in the flat meadows beyond.\r\n\r\nThe WELL AND BUCKET is a sign in Shoreditch, not badly chosen, as it\r\nintimates an inexhaustible supply; it is of very old standing in London,\r\nfor it is mentioned in the “Paston Letters” in the year 1472.[545]\r\n\r\n  “I pray God send you all your desires and me my mewed goss-hawk in\r\n  haste, or, rather than fail, a scar-hawk; there is a grocer dwelling\r\n  right over against the WELL WITH TWO BUCKETS, a little from St Helen’s\r\n  Church, hath ever hawks to sell.”\r\n\r\nThe anxiety about the bird, expressed in this letter, is most\r\namusing:--“I ask no more good of you for all the services that I shall\r\ndo you, while the world standeth, but a goss-hawk,” is the commencement\r\nof the letter, which concludes:--\r\n\r\n  “Now, think on me, good lord, for if I have not an hawk I shall wax\r\n  fat for default of labour, and dead for default of company by my\r\n  troth.”\r\n\r\nIn old times the ale-house windows were generally open, so that the\r\ncompany within might enjoy the fresh air, and see all that was going on\r\nin the street; but, as the scenes within were not always fit to be seen\r\nby the “profanum vulgus” that passed by, a trellis was put up in the\r\nopen window. This trellis, or lattice, was generally painted red, to the\r\nintent, it has been jocularly suggested, that it might harmonise with\r\nthe rich hue of the customers’ noses; which effect, at all events, was\r\nobtained by the choice of this colour. Thus Pistol says:--\r\n\r\n  “He called me even now by word through a red lattice, and I could see\r\n  no part of his face from the window.”\r\n\r\nThe same idea is expressed in the “Last Will and Testament of Lawrence\r\nLucifer,” 1604:--\r\n\r\n  “Watched sometimes ten hours together in an ale-house, ever and anon\r\n  peeping forth and sampling thy nose with the red lattice.”\r\n\r\nSo common was this fixture, that no ale-house was without it:--\r\n\r\n  “A whole street is in some places but a continuous ale-house, not a\r\n  shop to be seen between red lattice and red lattice.”--_Decker’s\r\n  English Villanies Seven Times Pressed to Death._\r\n\r\nAt last it became synonymous with ale-house:--\r\n\r\n  “As well known by my wit as an ale-house by a _red lattice_.”[546]\r\n\r\n  “Trusty Rachel was drinking burnt brandy with a couple of tinder-box\r\n  cryers at the next _red lattice_.”[547]\r\n\r\nThe lattices continued in use until the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and after they disappeared from the windows were adopted as\r\nsigns, and as such they continue to the present day. The GREEN LATTICE\r\noccurs on a trades token of Cock Lane, and still figures at the door of\r\nan ale-house in Billingsgate, whilst not many years ago there was one,\r\nin Brownlow Street, Holborn, which had been corrupted into the GREEN\r\nLETTUCE.\r\n\r\nWhen balconies were newly introduced, they were also used in the place\r\nof signs. Lord Arundel was the inventor of them, and Covent Garden the\r\nfirst place where they became general. “Every house here has one of\r\n’em,” says Richard Broome, in 1659. Trades tokens “of THE BELLCONEY,” in\r\nBedford Street, are still extant, and also tokens of “John Williams, the\r\nking’s chairman, at y^{e} lower end of St Martin’s Lane, AT Y^{E}\r\nBALCONEY. 1667.” The first house that adopted a balcony was situated at\r\nthe corner of Chandos Street, “which country people were wont much to\r\ngaze on;” soon, however, they became so common that further distinctions\r\nhad to be added, as the IRON BALCONY, (St James’ Street, 1699,) the\r\nBLUE AND GILT BALCONY, (Hatton Street, 1673.) Lamps have also, for two\r\nor three centuries, frequently done duty as signs, and continue still to\r\nact as beacons to those who want the assistance of the doctor, the\r\nchemist, or the sweep. Ale and coffee-houses, too, are frequently\r\ndecorated with gorgeous lamps: this was already the custom in Tom\r\nBrown’s time:--\r\n\r\n  “Every coffee-house is illuminated both without and within doors;\r\n  without by a _fine Glass Lanthorn_, and within by a woman so light and\r\n  splendid you may see through her without the help of a\r\n  Perspective.”[548]\r\n\r\nThe Moorfield quacks had always lamps at their doors at night, with\r\nround glasses, having the same colours as the balls in their signs, and\r\nthis custom has been handed down to our day by the chemists, who still\r\nhave circular, red, green, and yellow bull’s-eye glasses in their lamps.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, in the sixteenth century, the pastry-cooks used at nights to\r\nplace a kind of lamp in their windows, which acted as magic lanterns.\r\nThey were made of transparent paper, covered with rudely-painted figures\r\nof men and animals. Regnier mentions them in his eleventh satire:--\r\n\r\n  “Ressemblait transparent une lanterne vive,\r\n  Dont quelques patissiers amusent les enfants,\r\n  Où des oysons bridez, guenuches, elefans,\r\n  Chiens, chats, lièvres, renards, et mainte estrange beste\r\n  Courent l’une après l’autre.”[549]\r\n\r\nA Dutch grocer, in the seventeenth century, put up the sign of the\r\nBURNING LAMP, and wrote under it the following distich:--\r\n\r\n  “Myn lampje brant uyt den Orienten,\r\n  Ik verkoop oly, vygen en krenten.”[550]\r\n\r\nThe BRASS KNOCKER in the Great Gardens, Bristol, is another sign taken\r\nfrom the exterior of the house; also the FLOWER-POT, which was very\r\ncommon in old London: one of the last remaining stood at the corner of\r\nBishopsgate and Leadenhall Streets. It dated from an early period, and\r\nwas, in the heyday of its fame, a celebrated coaching inn. The\r\nintroduction of railroads, however, gave it a death-blow; for some time\r\nit continued to languish as a starting-point for omnibuses, and was\r\nfinally demolished to make room for merchants’ offices in 1863. Trades\r\ntokens of this inn are extant in the Beaufoy collection. Mr Burn, the\r\ncompiler of the catalogue of this collection, suggests that the\r\nFlower-pot was originally the vase of lilies, always represented in the\r\nold pictures of the Salutation or Annunciation; according to his theory\r\nthe Angel and the Virgin were omitted at the Reformation, and nothing\r\nbut the vase left. This, however, seems somewhat improbable. There is no\r\napparent reason why it should not have been a real flower-pot, or rather\r\nvase, which our ancestors frequently had on the top of the pent-houses\r\nabove their shops. In order to distinguish them from ordinary\r\nflower-pots, some painted theirs blue, thus the sign of the BLUE\r\nFLOWER-POT, as appears from the advertisement of Cornelius a Tilborgh,\r\nwho styles himself “sworn chirurgeon in ordinary to King Charles II., to\r\nour late sovereign King William, as also to her present majesty Queen\r\nAnne.” This worthy lived in Great Lincoln’s Inn Fields, Holborn Row, and\r\nbesides the Blue Flower-pot at his front door, his customers might\r\nrecognise the house, by “a light at night over the door,” and a Blue\r\nBall at the back-door. The TWO BLUE FLOWER-POTS used to be a sign in\r\nDean Street, Soho; and the TWO FLOWER-POTS AND SUN DIAL in Parker’s\r\nLane, near Drury Lane, (_London Gazette_, Sept. 16-19, 1700.)\r\n\r\nInnumerable objects from the interior of the house were likewise adopted\r\nas signs, such as furniture of all kinds, and domestic utensils. The\r\nupholsterers, for instance, generally selected pieces of furniture. At\r\nthe end of the last century THE ROYAL BED was a great favourite, as may\r\nbe seen from engravings on several of the shop bills in the Banks\r\ncollection; the bed in olden times was a very important article in a\r\nhousehold, and was always particularly named in the will. Upholsterers\r\nin those days were also frequently called bed-joiners. Next we have the\r\nBOARD or Table, still a great favourite in the north--in Durham alone at\r\nleast sixty public-houses with that sign could be named.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the Table affords an opportunity for particularising\r\nthose good things which usually grace the festive board. First of all\r\nthere is the SALT HORN, (at Bradford and Leeds,) which formerly at\r\ndinner marked the line of demarcation; for whether a guest was to be\r\nplaced above or below the salt was a matter of etiquette strictly to be\r\nattended to. In Dudley we find a very substantial and tempting ROUND OF\r\nBEEF, with the following rhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “If you are hungry or a-dry,\r\n    Or your stomach out of order,\r\n  There’s sure relief at the Round of Beef,\r\n    For both these two disorders.”\r\n\r\nThe roast beef of old England is further represented by THE RIBS OF\r\nBEEF, in Wensum Street, Norwich. THE FLANK OF BEEF at Spalding, the much\r\nless tempting COW ROAST at Hampstead, besides a couple of unpretending\r\nBEEF-STEAKS in Bath. Our bill of fare also contains plenty of mutton,\r\nsometimes _rehaussé_ with a poetic sauce, as one that was at Hackney in\r\nthe last century, THE SHOULDER OF MUTTON AND CAT, having the following\r\nrhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “Pray Puss, don’t tear,\r\n    For the Mutton is so dear;\r\n  Pray Puss, don’t claw,\r\n    For the Mutton yet is raw.”\r\n\r\nThe sign is still there, but the verses are gone. This suggested to\r\nanother innkeeper on the common at Horsham, the sign of the DOG AND\r\nBACON. An epicurean publican at Yapton, Arundel, has a more gastronomic\r\ncombination, viz.:--the SHOULDER OF MUTTON AND CUCUMBERS. It was at the\r\nSHOULDER OF MUTTON in Brecknock that Mrs Siddons, England’s greatest\r\ntragic actress, was born, July 14, 1755. “Fancy,” writes an enthusiastic\r\nbiographer, “the English Melpomene behind the bar of such a place!” Legs\r\nof Mutton on the signboard do not appear to be so common as Shoulders.\r\nBut by far the finest of all the dishes represented on the signboard was\r\nthe BOAR’S HEAD, in Eastcheap, for the character of the famous inn\r\npatronised by Jack Falstaff makes the association of an excellent dish\r\nmuch more natural than any heraldic origin. The first mention of this\r\ninn occurs in the testament of William Warden, in the reign of Richard\r\nII., who gave “all that tenement called the Boar’s Head in Eastcheap,”\r\nto a college of priests, or chaplains, founded by Sir W. Walworth, the\r\nLord Mayor, in the adjoining church of St Michael, Crooked Lane. The\r\npresence of “Prince Hal” in this house was no invention of Shakespeare;\r\nhistory records his pranks, how one night, with his two brothers, John\r\nand Thomas, he made such a riot that they had to be taken before the\r\nmagistrate. No wonder, then, at the proud inscription on the sign, which\r\nstill existed in Maitland’s time:--“_This is the chief tavern in\r\nLondon_.” At one time the portal was decorated with carved oak figures\r\nof Falstaff and Prince Henry; and in 1834 the former was in the\r\npossession of a brazier of Eastcheap, whose ancestors had lived in the\r\nshop he then occupied since the great fire. The last great Shakespearian\r\ndinner-party at the Boar’s Head took place about 1784, on which occasion\r\nWilberforce and Pitt were present, and though there were many professed\r\nwits, Pitt was the most amusing of the company.\r\n\r\nOn the removal of a mound of rubbish at Whitechapel, brought there after\r\nthe great fire, a carved boxwood bas-relief boar’s head was found, set\r\nin a circular frame formed by two boars’ tusks, mounted and united with\r\nsilver. An inscription to the following effect was pricked in the\r\nback:--“Wm. Brooke, Landlord of the Bore’s Hedde, Estchepe, 1566.” This\r\nobject, formerly in the possession of Mr Stamford, the celebrated\r\npublisher, was sold at Christie and Manson’s, on January 27, 1855, and\r\nwas bought by Mr Halliwell.[551]\r\n\r\nThe original inn having been destroyed by the fire, was rebuilt and\r\ncontinued in existence until 1831, when it was finally demolished to\r\nmake way for the streets leading to new London Bridge. Its site was\r\nbetween Small Alley and St Michael’s Lane. The ancient sign, carved in\r\nstone, with the initials I. T. and the date 1668, is now preserved in\r\nthe City of London Library, Guildhall.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May 1718, one James Austin, “inventor of the Persian ink\r\npowder,” desiring to give his customers a substantial proof of his\r\ngratitude, invited them to the Boar’s Head to partake of an immense\r\nplum-pudding. This pudding weighed 1000 lbs.; a baked pudding of 1 foot\r\nsquare, and the best piece of an ox roasted: the principal dish was put\r\nin the copper on Monday, May 12, at the RED LION Inn, by the Mint in\r\nSouthwark, and had to boil fourteen days. From there it was to be\r\nbrought to the SWAN TAVERN, in Fish Street Hill, accompanied by a band\r\nof music playing--“What lumps of pudding my mother gave me;” one of the\r\ninstruments was a drum in proportion to the pudding, being 18 feet 2\r\ninches in length, and 4 feet diameter, which was drawn by “a device fixt\r\non six asses.” Finally the monstrous pudding was to be divided in St\r\nGeorge’s Fields, but apparently its smell was too much for the gluttony\r\nof the Londoners; the escort was routed, the pudding taken and devoured,\r\nand the whole ceremony brought to an end, before Mr Austin had a chance\r\nto regale his customers.\r\n\r\nPuddings seem to have been the _forte_ of this Austin. Twelve or\r\nthirteen years before this last pudding, he had baked one for a wager,\r\nten feet deep in the Thames, near Rotherhithe, by enclosing it in a\r\ngreat tin pan, and that in a sack of lime: it was taken up after about\r\ntwo hours and a half, and eaten with great relish, its only fault being\r\nthat it was somewhat overdone. The bet was for more than £100. Austin\r\nwas also noted for his fireworks.\r\n\r\nThe back windows of the Boar’s Head looked out upon the burial-ground of\r\nSt Michael’s Church,[552] and there rested all that was mortal of one of\r\nthe waiters of this tavern. His tomb, in Purbeck stone, had the\r\nfollowing epitaph:--\r\n\r\n  “HERE LIETH THE BODYE of Robert Preston, late Drawer at the Boar’s\r\n  Head Tavern, Great Eastcheap, who departed this Life, March 16, Anno\r\n  Domini, 1730, aged 27 years.”\r\n\r\n  “Bacchus, to give the topeing world surprize,\r\n  Produc’d one sober son, and here he lies.\r\n  Tho’ nurs’d among full Hogsheads, he defy’d\r\n  The charm of wine and ev’ry vice beside.\r\n  O Reader, if to Justice thou ’rt inclin’d,\r\n  Keep Honest Preston daily in thy Mind.\r\n  He drew good wine, took care to fill his pots,\r\n  Had sundry virtues that outweighed his fauts (sic)\r\n  You that on Bacchus have the like dependance,\r\n  Pray, copy Bob, in measure and attendance.”[553]\r\n\r\nAmongst other Boar’s Head Inns, we may notice one in Southwark, the\r\nproperty of Sir John Falstolf of Caistor Castle, Norfolk, who died in\r\n1460, and whose name Shakespeare adopted in the play. Then there was\r\nanother one without Aldgate, as appears from the following curious\r\ndocument:--\r\n\r\n  “At St James’s the v daye of September, an. 1557.\r\n\r\n  “A letter to the Lord Mayor of London, to give order forthwith that\r\n  some of his officers do forthwith repaire to the Boreshed w^{hout}\r\n  Aldgate, where the Lordes are enformed a lewde Playe, called ‘A Sacke\r\n  full of Newse,’ shall be plaied this daye, the Playeres whereof he is\r\n  willed to apprehende and to comitt to safe warde, untill he shall\r\n  heare further from hence, and to take their Playsbook from them, and\r\n  to send the same hither.\r\n\r\n  “At West^{r} the vj daye of Sep. 1557.”[554]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this century there was a noted tavern in Bond\r\nStreet, called THE BRAWN’S HEAD, and the general opinion was, that at\r\none time it had a brawn or boar’s head for its sign; this, however, was\r\na mistake; the house was named after the head of a noted cook whose name\r\nwas Theophilus Brawn, formerly landlord of Rummer Tavern in Great Queen\r\nStreet, and the article (as the letters THE were usually supposed to be)\r\nwas simply an abbreviation of the man’s magnificent Christian name.\r\n\r\nAll these gastronomic signs, doubtless, originated in the old custom of\r\nlandlords selling eatables:--\r\n\r\n  “You brave-minded and most joviall Sardanapalitans,” saith Taylor the\r\n  Water poet, addressing the country tavern-keepers, “have power and\r\n  prerogative (_cum privilegio_) to receive, lodge, feast, and feed,\r\n  both man and beast. You have the happinesse to Boyle, Roast, Broyle,\r\n  and Bake, Fish, Flesh, and Foule, whilst we in London have scarce the\r\n  command of a _Gull_, a _widgeon_, or a _woodcock_.”\r\n\r\nIn a little volume of 1685, entitled “The Praise of Yorkshire ale,” we\r\nare told that Bacchus held a parliament in the SUN, behind the Exchange\r\nin York, to consider the adulteration of wine, the various drinking\r\nvessels, and other matters sold in alehouses, as:--\r\n\r\n  “Papers of sugar, with such like knacks,\r\n  Biskets, Luke olives, Anchoves, Caveare,\r\n  Neats’ tongues, Westphalia Hambs, and\r\n  Such like cheat, Crabs, Lobsters, Collar Beef,\r\n  Cold puddings, oysters, and such like stuff.”\r\n\r\nHence, then, the once common sign of the THREE NEATS’ TONGUES, one of\r\nwhich still exists in Spitalfields; another one in the eighteenth\r\ncentury was very appropriately situated in Bull and Mouth Street.[555]\r\nThe HAM is the usual porkman’s sign, though at Walmyth, in Yorkshire,\r\nthere is a public-house sign of the HAM AND FIRKIN. THE CRAB AND LOBSTER\r\nInn occurs at Ventnor; the LOBSTER is a sign on trades tokens of a shop\r\nin Bearbinder (now St Swithin’s) Lane, and also near the Maypole in the\r\nStrand; the CRAWFISH at Thursford Guist, in Norfolk, and the BUTT AND\r\nOYSTER at Chelmondiston, Ipswich. Those eatables, all more or less salt,\r\nwere sold as incitements to drink, and went by the cant term of shoeing\r\nhorns, gloves, or pullers-on. They are often alluded to by ancient\r\nauthors:--\r\n\r\n  “Then, sir, comes me up a service of _shoeing-horns_ of all sorts,\r\n  salt cakes, red herrings, anchoves, and gammon of bacon, and abundance\r\n  of such _pullers-on_.”--Bishop Hall’s _Mundus alter et idem_.\r\n\r\nThe PIE was a sign in very early times, and gave its name to Pie Corner,\r\n“a place so called from such a sign, sometimes a fair inn for receipt of\r\ntravellers.”--_Stow_, p. 139. One of the most famous inns with that sign\r\nwas the PIE in Aldgate.\r\n\r\n  “One ask’d a friend where Captain Shark did lye,\r\n  Why, sir, quoth he, at Aldgate at the Pye.\r\n  Away, quoth th’ other, he lies not there, I know’t.\r\n  No, sayes the other, then he lies in ’s throat.”\r\n\r\n  _Wits’ Recreation_, p. 185, vol. ii.\r\n\r\nDe Foe, in his “History of the Plague,” tells of “a dreadful set of\r\nfellows” who used to revel and roar nightly in that inn during the time\r\nthe plague was at its height, but within a fortnight all of them were\r\nburied. The COCK AND PIE was once common. At an inn in Ipswich there\r\nused to be a rude representation of a cock perched on a pie, which was\r\ndiscovered whilst the house was undergoing some repairs. It was also,\r\nabout the middle of last century, the sign of a house famed for\r\nconviviality, which stood on the site of the present Rathbone Place,\r\nOxford Street, and was the resort of the “fancy” of those days. A row of\r\nfine elms connected this house with another, noted for the manufacture\r\nof Bath buns and Tunbridge water-cakes, the latter a dainty now almost\r\nobsolete, but which then was so famous, that it was one of the London\r\ncries, being sold by a man on horseback. With regard to the origin of\r\nthe sign COCK AND PIE, both the ancient Catholic oath, to swear by _Cock\r\nand Pie_, (by God and the Pie, or Roman Catholic service book,) and the\r\nfable of the magpie (Old English _pie_, or _pye_) and the peacocks, have\r\neach been duly considered by us; but the sign is probably only an\r\nabbreviation of the _Peacock and Pie_. In ancient times the peacock was\r\na favourite dish, and was introduced on the table in a pie; the head,\r\nwith gilt beak, being elevated above the crust, and the beautiful\r\nfeathers of the tail expanded. As a dainty dish, then, it may have been\r\nput up, like the other good things of this world, just mentioned, as a\r\ntrap to hungry or epicurean passers-by; at last the dish went out of\r\nfashion, the name even became a mystery, and was rendered by the\r\nsign-painters, according to their own understanding, by a COCK AND\r\nMAGPIE, which is still very common. There is a public-house with such a\r\nsign in Drury Lane, which was already in existence more than two\r\ncenturies ago, when the rest of Drury Lane was still occupied by farms\r\nand gardens, and the mansions of the Drury family. Hither the youths\r\nand maidens of the metropolis, who, on May-day, danced round the Maypole\r\nin the Strand, were accustomed to resort for cakes and ale, and other\r\nrefreshments. This ale-house gave its name to the _Cock and Pye_ Fields,\r\nbetween Drury Lane and St Giles’ Hospital. At Chatsworth, the original\r\nname was mutilated by a provincialism into the COCK AND PYNOT,\r\n(Derbyshire, for Magpie.) In this ale-house, still existing, the\r\nRevolution of 1688 was plotted, between Thomas Osborne Earl of Danby,\r\nWilliam Cavendish Earl of Devonshire, and Mr John d’Arcy. They met by\r\nappointment on a heath adjoining the house, but a shower of rain coming\r\non, they adjourned to the inn. The room is still shown in which the\r\nconspirators met. In Hone’s “Table Book” there is a woodcut of the inn,\r\nshowing the wooden construction across the road, by which the signs in\r\nvillages were generally suspended.\r\n\r\nLastly, we may mention the PICKLED EGG, in Clerkenwell. As the origin of\r\nthis sign, it is said that Charles II. here once partook of the dish,\r\nwhich so flattered the landlord, that he adopted it as his sign, and so\r\nit has remained till this day. It has given its name to a lane called\r\nPickled Egg Walk, in which there was a notorious cocking-house,\r\nfrequently mentioned in advertisements _circa_ 1775.\r\n\r\nWe may very appropriately terminate the gastronomic signs with the\r\nCHESHIRE CHEESE, which is still very common; there is a famous tavern of\r\nthis name in Wine Office Court, Fleet Street, and numerous public-houses\r\nin the country have adopted it as their signs. And as we began with the\r\n_Salt Horn_ we will end with the MUSTARD-POT, which was the sign of a\r\nmustard shop in Holland, in the seventeenth century, with these\r\nrhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “Ik lever uyt\r\n  Een zeldzaam kruyt\r\n  Daar zyn der weinig in de stad\r\n  Of ik heb ze by de neus gehad.”[556]\r\n\r\nThis reminds us of a rather indelicate sign of a mustard shop, formerly\r\nin the Rue du Chatel, at Beauvais, but now in the Musée d’Antiquités of\r\nthat town, representing a fool stirring mustard in a barrel with a large\r\nstick, whilst a tall grinning monkey stands just opposite, assisting\r\nhim in a way we need not describe.\r\n\r\nDrinkables are not frequent as signs, if we except such as the RHENISH\r\nWINE HOUSE, and the CANARY HOUSE; two taverns of Old London, named after\r\nthe wines they sold. BARLEY BROTH, BEE’S-WING, and YORKSHIRE STINGO, are\r\nat present all three common: the first applies either to whisky or beer;\r\nthe second is the delicate crimson film left in bottles by old port\r\nwine, and Yorkshire stingo is the well-known name of a kind of ale. From\r\na house with this name in the New Road, the first pair of London\r\nomnibuses were started, July 4, 1829, running to the Bank and back: they\r\nwere constructed to carry twenty-two passengers, all inside; the fare\r\nwas one shilling, or sixpence for half the distance, together with the\r\nluxury of a newspaper. A Mr J. Shillibeer was the owner of these\r\ncarriages, and the first conductors were the two sons of a British naval\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nDrinking vessels are very appropriate ale-house signs. Amongst the\r\noldest certainly ranks the BLACK JACK, common even in the present day,\r\nalthough the vessel that it represented is long since fallen into\r\ndisuse: it was a leather bottle, sometimes lined with silver or other\r\nmetal, and perhaps took its name from a part of the soldiers’ armour.\r\nSometimes it was ornamented with little silver bells “to ring peales of\r\ndrunkeness,” in which case it was called a “gyngle boy.”[557] This\r\nprimitive bottle has been celebrated in one of the Roxburghe Ballads,\r\n(vol. iii., fol. 433:)--\r\n\r\n  “God above that made all things,\r\n  The heaven, and earth, and all therein,\r\n  The ships that on the sea do swim\r\n  For to keepe the enemies out that none come in,\r\n  And let them all do what they can,\r\n  It is for the use and pains of man;\r\n  And I wish in heaven his soul may dwell,\r\n  Who first devized the leather bottle.”\r\n\r\nIts various good qualities are next explained, and finally:--\r\n\r\n  “Then when this bottle doth grow old,\r\n  And will no longer good liquor hold,\r\n  Out of its side you may take a clout,\r\n  Will mend your shoes when they are worn out,\r\n  Else take it and hang it upon a pin,\r\n  It will serve to put odd trifles in,\r\n  As hinges, awls, and candle ends,\r\n  For young beginners must have such things.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.\r\n\r\nBELL AND HORNS.\r\n\r\n(Formerly in Brompton Road, circa 1830.)\r\n\r\nRASP AND CROWN.\r\n\r\n(1780.)\r\n\r\nHAND AND GLOVE.\r\n\r\n(Harleian Collection, 1708.)\r\n\r\nGREEN MAN AND STILL.\r\n\r\n(Harleian Collection, 1630.)\r\n\r\nTHE PUMP.\r\n\r\n(Harleian Collection, 1710.)\r\n\r\nCROWN AND PATTEN.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1790.)]\r\n\r\nThere is another ballad in the same collection, (vol i., fol. 107,)\r\nentitled “Time’s Alteration, or the Old Man’s Rehearsal,” which speaks\r\nof the black jack in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n  “Black jacks to euery man\r\n  Were filled with wine and Beere,\r\n  No pewter Pot nor Canne\r\n  In those days did appeare:\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  We took not such delight\r\n  In cups of silver fine;\r\n  No pewter Pot nor Canne\r\n  In those days did appeare:\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  None under the degree of a knight\r\n  In Plate drunk Beere or Wine.”\r\n\r\nBut we may glean more full and complete particulars from Heywood’s\r\n“Philocothonista or Drunkard Opened, Dissected and Anatomized,” 1635,\r\nwhere we get a detailed inventory of all the various drinking vessels of\r\nthe day:--\r\n\r\n  “Of drinking Cups divers and sundry sorts we have; some of elme, some\r\n  of box, some of maple, some of holly, etc. Mazers, broad mouthed\r\n  dishes, naggins, whiskins, piggins, creuzes, alebowles, wassel bowles,\r\n  court dishes, tankards, kannes, from a pottle to a pint, from a pint\r\n  to a gill. Other bottles we have of leather, but they are most used\r\n  amongst the shepheards and harvest people of the countrey: small jacks\r\n  wee have in many alehouses of the citie and suburbs lipt with silver:\r\n  blackjacks and bombards at the Court; which when the Frenchmen first\r\n  saw, they reported at their return into their countrey that the\r\n  Englishmen used to drinke out of their bootes. We have besides cups\r\n  made of hornes of beastes, of cockernuts,[558] of goords, of eggs of\r\n  estriches; others made of the shells of divers fishes brought from the\r\n  Indies and other places, and shining like mother of pearle. Come to\r\n  plate, every taverne can afford you flat bowles, french bowles,\r\n  prounet cups, beare bowles, beakers; and private householders in the\r\n  citie, when they make a feaste to entertain their friends, can furnish\r\n  their cupboards with flaggons, tankards, beere cups, wine bowles, some\r\n  white, some percell guilt, some guilt all over, some with covers,\r\n  others without, of sundry shapes and qualities.”\r\n\r\nThat they were of ancient use and high in price appears from an entry in\r\nthe expenses of John, King of France, when prisoner in England after the\r\nbattle of Poictiers, 1359-60:--\r\n\r\n  “Pour deux bouteilles de cuir achetées a Londres pour Monseigneur\r\n  Philippe .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   9s. 8d.”\r\n\r\nThough these vessels are now completely superseded by pewter and glass,\r\nyet their memory still lives on the signboard, and the LEATHER BOTTLE\r\nis anything but an uncommon ale-house emblem at the present day. There\r\nis one still to be seen, carved in wood, suspended in front of an old\r\nale-house at the corner of Charles Street, Hatton Garden. In Germany,\r\nalso, the leather bottle was once in use; drinking vessels of various\r\nmaterials, in the shape of a boot, are common in that country, usually\r\nwith this inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Wer sein Stiefel nit drinken kan,\r\n  Der ist führwahr kein Teutscher Man.”\r\n\r\nThe _Black-jack_ Tavern, in Clare Market, still in existence, acquired\r\nsome celebrity from being the favourite haunt of Joe Miller, the reputed\r\nauthor of the famous Jest Book. The house was also for a long time known\r\nby the cant name of the Jump, which it had received from the fact of\r\nJack Sheppard one day escaping the clutches of Jonathan Wild’s\r\nemissaries by jumping from a window into the street, and so making his\r\nescape. From the Leather Bottle to the GOLDEN BOTTLE is not so great a\r\nstep as would appear at first sight, the golden bottle being simply the\r\nleather bottle gilt, as may be seen above the door of Messrs Hoare the\r\nbankers, in Fleet Street, a firm established for centuries under the\r\nsame sign, although not always occupying the same premises. In the\r\n“Little London Directory for 1677” we find:--“James Hore at the Golden\r\nBottle in Cheapside,” one of the goldsmiths that kept “running cashes.”\r\nIn 1693 we find Mr Richard Hoare, a goldsmith, “at the Golden Bottle” in\r\nCheapside, but in 1718 the house in Cheapside seems to have had a second\r\noccupant:--\r\n\r\n  “DROPT or taken from a Ladies’ side on Tuesday, the 25^{th} of March,\r\n  coming from the Spanish ambassadour’s at St James’ Square, a gold\r\n  watch and chain, with a seal to it, a pendulum[559] on the outside;\r\n  Windmill the maker. Whoever brings it to Mr Madding, Goldsmith at _the\r\n  Golden Bottle_, the upper end of Cheapside, or to Jonathan Wilde, over\r\n  against the _Duke of Grafton’s Head_ in the Old Bailey, shall have 8\r\n  Guineas and no questions asked.”--_Daily Courant_, April 5, 1718.\r\n\r\nThat the GOLDEN CAN was also an old sign may be concluded from a mention\r\nin the nursery rhyme:--\r\n\r\n  “Little Brown Betty lived at the _Golden Can_,\r\n  Where she brewed good ale for gentlemen.\r\n  And gentlemen came every day,\r\n  Till little brown Betty she hopt away.”\r\n\r\nWhere the fact of little brown Betty brewing good ale points to a very\r\nold custom, when ale-wives flourished, and Eleanor Rumying and her\r\ngossips brewed their own ale. The GOLDEN CAN is still to be seen on two\r\npublic-houses in Norwich. The GUILDED CUP in Houndsditch is mentioned in\r\na quaint little pamphlet on the virtues of “Warme Beere,” 1641.\r\n\r\nTHE FLASK was the sign of an old-established tavern in Ebury Square,\r\nPimlico. In the last century there were two famous _Flask_ taverns in\r\nHampstead; the one called the _Lower Flask_ was an inn at the foot of\r\nthe hill, and is mentioned in the following advertisement, printed on\r\nthe cover of the original edition of the _Spectator_, No. 428:--\r\n\r\n  “This is to give notice that Hampstead Fair is to be kept upon the\r\n  _Lower Flask_ Tavern Walk, on Friday, the first of August, and holds\r\n  for four days.”\r\n\r\nThe UPPER FLASK was a place of public entertainment near the summit of\r\nHampstead Hill, and is now a private residence. Here Richardson sends\r\nhis Clarissa:--“The Hampstead coach, when the dear fugitive came to it,\r\nhad but two passengers in it, but she made the fellow go off directly,\r\npaying for the vacant places. The two passengers directing the coachman\r\nto set them down at the _Upper Flask_, she bid them set her down there\r\nalso.” The well-known Kit-Kat Club used to meet at this tavern in the\r\nsummer months; and here, after it became a private abode, George\r\nSteevens, the celebrated critic and antiquary, lived and died.\r\n\r\nBesides these, more homely vessels occur as publicans’ signs at the\r\npresent day, which it requires no stretch of imagination to understand\r\nthe meaning of, as the PITCHER AND GLASS, the BROWN JUG, the JUG AND\r\nGLASS, the BOTTLE AND GLASS, the FOAMING QUART, &c. At Newark the BOTTLE\r\nis accompanied by the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “From this Bottle I am sure\r\n  You’ll get a glass both good and pure,\r\n  In opposition to a many,\r\n  I’m striving hard to get a penny.”\r\n\r\nThe PEWTER POT, an old sign, is thus alluded to by Randle Holme.[560]\r\n\r\n  “This should be looked upon by all good artists to be the most ignoble\r\n  and dishonourable bearing; but as the custom takes away the sense of\r\n  dislike, so the frequent use takes away the dishonour, which is seen\r\n  by those multitudes that have it for their cognizance, in so much\r\n  that it is painted over their doors by the wayside.”[561]\r\n\r\nThe _Pewter Pot_, in Leadenhall Street, was a famous carriers’ and\r\ncoaching inn in 1681. There are also the SIX CANS, in High Holborn, (a\r\nsign evidently suggested by the THREE TUNS;) and, in the same locality,\r\nthe SIX CANS AND PUNCHBOWL. This last object, the PUNCHBOWL, was\r\nintroduced on the signboard at the end of the seventeenth century, when\r\npunch became the fashionable drink; in one instance, at Penalney Kea,\r\nnear Truro, we have the PUNCHBOWL AND LADLE, but most generally it is\r\nfound in combination with other very heterogeneous objects. The reason\r\nof this is that punch, like music, had a sort of political prestige, and\r\nwas the Whig drink, whilst the Tories adhered to sack, claret, and\r\ncanary, connected in their memory with bygone things and times. Hence it\r\nfollowed that the punchbowl was added as a kind of party-badge to many\r\nof the Whig tavern signs, and hence such combinations as the following,\r\nall of which still survive at the present day:--\r\n\r\nThe CROWN AND PUNCHBOWL, Somersham, St Ives.\r\n\r\nThe MAGPIE AND PUNCHBOWL, Bishopsgate Within.\r\n\r\nThe ROSE AND PUNCHBOWL, Redman’s Row, Stepney, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe SHIP AND PUNCHBOWL, Wapping.\r\n\r\nThe RED LION AND PUNCHBOWL, St John’s Street, Clerkenwell.\r\n\r\nThe UNION FLAG AND PUNCHBOWL, High Street, Wapping.\r\n\r\nThe DOG AND PUNCHBOWL, Lymm, Warrington, Cheshire.\r\n\r\nThe HALFMOON AND PUNCHBOWL, Buckle Street, Whitechapel.\r\n\r\nThe PARROT AND PUNCHBOWL, Aldringham, Suffolk.\r\n\r\nThe FOX AND PUNCHBOWL, Old Windsor, (perhaps meant for the great\r\nstatesman, who was not disinclined to the beverage.)\r\n\r\nThe TWO POTS is the sign of a public-house at Boxworth, St Ives,\r\naccompanied by the following verses, which are enough to set the teeth\r\nof a Bœotian on edge: how then must they shock the refined ears of the\r\nCambridge dons?--\r\n\r\n  “Rest, traveller, rest; lo, Cooper’s hand\r\n  Obedient brings two pots at thy command;\r\n  Rest, traveller, rest; and banish thoughts of care,\r\n  Drink to thy friends and recommend them here.”\r\n\r\nAnother Two Pots, at Leatherhead, can boast a most venerable antiquity,\r\nfor it is believed to be the very ale-house where the notorious Eleanor\r\nRumying tunned her “noppy ale,” and made\r\n\r\n        “thereof fast sale\r\n  To travellers, to tinkers,\r\n  To sweaters, to swinkers,\r\n  And all good ale-drinkers.”\r\n\r\nThere was, at the end of the last century, a painted sign still\r\nremaining, which, under a coating of summer’s dust and winter’s sludge,\r\nfaintly showed two pots of beer placed in the same position as they are\r\non the title-page of the original edition of Skelton’s poem.\r\n\r\nThe sign of the Two Pots again gave rise to that of the THREE POTS, at\r\nHorseway Bridge, Chatteris, in the same county, and at Burbage, near\r\nHinckley.\r\n\r\nThe RUMMER, another drinking vessel, is also common: there is one in Old\r\nFish Street, and there are three _Rummer_ public-houses in Bristol\r\nalone. A tavern of that name was kept by Samuel Prior, uncle of Matthew\r\nPrior the poet. Uncle Sam took his nephew as an apprentice to learn the\r\nbusiness, and be his successor. Prior alludes to this uncle and his\r\nlittle professional tricks in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “My uncle, rest his soul, when living,\r\n  Might have contrived me ways of thriving;\r\n  Taught me with cider to replenish\r\n  My vats or ebbing tide of Rhenish;\r\n  So, when for Hock I drew pricked white Wine,\r\n  Swear ’t had the flavour and was right wine.”\r\n\r\nTo his stay in this tavern also alludes the bitter Whig satire in “State\r\nPoems,” (ii., p. 355,) beginning--\r\n\r\n  “A vintner’s boy the wretch was first preferr’d\r\n  To wait at vice’s gates and pimp for bread;\r\n  To hold the candle, and sometimes the door,\r\n  Let in the drunkard, and let out the w----.”\r\n\r\nIn 1709 there was another Rummer tavern “over against Bow Lane, in\r\nCheapside,” where “the surprizing Mr Higgins, the posture master, that\r\nlately performed at the Queen’s Theatre Royal in the Haymarket,” was to\r\nbe seen every evening at six; admission 18d. and 1s.\r\n\r\nThis sign was also common in Holland two centuries ago; at that time\r\nthere was one in Amsterdam with this inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Als gy dees Roemer ziet, gy kunt ze pryzen of laken,\r\n  Maar komt in, proeft zyn nat, dat zal u beeter smaaken.”[562]\r\n\r\nAnd another one at the Hague had this same idea, but added a caution to\r\nit on a double-sided signboard:--\r\n\r\n  “Dees Roemer die gy ziet en kan u niet vermaken,\r\n  Komt in en proeft het nat het zal u beter smaken\r\n  Maar siet eens wat hier achter staat.”\r\n\r\nOn the other side:--\r\n\r\n  “Betaal eerst, eer je henen gaat\r\n  Of anders hoed of mantel laat.”[563]\r\n\r\nA near relative of the Rummer was the BUMPER, a tavern in St James’\r\nStreet, Covent Garden, kept by Estcourt the actor. His drawer was “his\r\nold servant Trusty Anthony, who has so often adorned both the theatres\r\nin England and Ireland; and as he is a person altogether unknown in the\r\nWine Trade, it cannot be doubted but that he will deliver the wine in\r\nthe same natural purity as he receives it from the said merchants,”\r\n(Brooke & Hillier.)--Estcourt’s advertisements on the last page of the\r\noriginal Edition of the _Spectator_, cclx., 1711. To this occupation of\r\nEstcourt, Parnell alludes in the beginning of his poems:--\r\n\r\n  “Gay Bacchus liking Estcourt’s wine,\r\n    A noble meal bespoke us;\r\n  And for the guests that were to dine\r\n    Brought Comus, Love, and Jocus.”\r\n\r\nThis same Estcourt was sometime provedore of the Beefsteak Club.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may conclude this notice of drinking vessels on the\r\nsignboard with the TANKARD, which is still of frequent occurrence. There\r\nis a public-house at Ipswich with this sign, which was formerly part of\r\nthe house of Sir Anthony Wingfield, one of the legal executors of Henry\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nThe hanap or tankard was generally of silver, and was formerly one of\r\nthe most valuable properties of an ale-house, for in the Act 13 Edw. I.,\r\nit says that “if a tavern-keeper keep his house open after curfew he\r\nshall be put on his surety the first time by the _hanap_ of the tavern,\r\nor by some other good pledge therein found.”[564] Silver tankards were\r\nmore or less common in all the London taverns. In some houses they were\r\nreserved for the more distinguished visitors; in others, as at the\r\nBull’s Head in Leadenhall Street, “every poor mechanic drank in plate.”\r\nThey were of different sizes, and experienced topers well knew for which\r\nname to call when ordering a tankard proportionate to their thirst. From\r\na curious old tippler’s handbook, published in the reign of Queen Anne\r\nor George the First, entitled, “A Vade Mecum for Maltworms,” we gather\r\nthat the names of the tankards at the SWEET APPLE, in Sweet Apple Yard,\r\nwere “the Lamb,” “the Lion,” “the Peacock,” (in honour of the brewer,)\r\n“Sacheverell,” (in memory of the notorious divine of St Andrew’s,\r\nHolborn,) and “Nan Elton.” The same work also relates a curious instance\r\nof enthusiasm in a publican. His house, the Raven, in Fetter Lane, was\r\nfamous for\r\n\r\n  “Massy tankards form’d of silver plate,\r\n  That walk throughout his noted house in state;\r\n  Ever since Eaglesfield in Anna’s reign,\r\n  To compliment each fortunate campaign,\r\n  Made one be hammer’d out for every town was ta’en.”\r\n\r\nWe may suppose each tankard named after a victory--the greater the\r\nvictory, the greater the tankard; and can imagine the gratifying display\r\nof loyalty in emptying those tankards to the perdition of “Popery and\r\nwooden shoes.”\r\n\r\nBesides the tankard for drinking beer or wine, there was also the WATER\r\nTANKARD. In Ben Jonson’s comedy of “Every Man in his Humour,” 1598, Cob,\r\nthe water-carrier of the Old Jewry, says:--“I dwell, sir, at the sign of\r\nthe WATER TANKARD, hard by the _Green Lattice_. I have paid scot and lot\r\nthere many time this eighteen years.” These water-tankards were used for\r\ncarrying water from the conduits to the houses, and were therefore a\r\nprofessional sign of the water-carriers. The measures held about three\r\ngallons, and were shaped like a truncated cone, with an iron handle and\r\nhoops like a pail, and were closed with a cork, bung, or stopple. In\r\nWilkinson’s “Londina Illustrata,” there is an engraving of Westcheap as\r\nit appeared in the year 1585, copied from a drawing of the period, in\r\nwhich the Little Conduit is seen with a quantity of water-tankards\r\nranged round it.\r\n\r\nAmongst the other articles of furniture which are represented on the\r\nsignboard we must first of all notice that useful article the LOOKING\r\nGLASS, which was the favourite sign of the booksellers on London Bridge.\r\nThus, one of John Bunyan’s works, “The Saints’ Triumph, or the Glory of\r\nSaints with Jesus Christ discovered in a Divine Ejaculation by J. B.,”\r\nwas printed by J. Millet for J. Blare, at the Looking Glass on London\r\nBridge, in 1688. The French booksellers also used it: for instance,\r\nNicholas Despréaux, or Dupré, a bookseller of the seventeenth century,\r\nwho lived near the church of St Etienne du Mont, at Paris. Its origin\r\nwas this:--Speculum, a looking-glass, was in the middle ages a common\r\nname for a certain class of books. We find, as early as 1332, a work\r\nentitled “Speculum Historiale in consuetudine Parisiensi;” then there is\r\nthe “Grand Speculum Historiale,” the great historical work of Vincent of\r\nBeauvais, one of the most celebrated books of the Middle Ages; “Speculum\r\nHumanæ Salvationis;” “Speculum Humanæ Vitæ;” “Speculum Vitæ Christæ,” “a\r\nboke that is clepid the Myrrour of the blessed lyffe of our Lorde J’hu\r\ncryste;” the “Mirrour of Magistrates;” “Le miroir de l’ame pécheresse,”\r\nand innumerable other Speculums. These Speculums were amongst the first\r\nbooks that were printed; many of the early booksellers adopted the\r\n_Bible_ as their sign, whilst others chose the Speculum, which they\r\ntranslated and made more fit for the signboard under the name of the\r\nLOOKING GLASS.\r\n\r\nA curious fact is connected with this so common title of the Speculum\r\nfor early religious books. When the first pioneers in the art of\r\nprinting were pondering over their new invention, during the transition\r\nperiod from block-printing to printing with detached letters,\r\nGuttenberg, in 1436, entered into an agreement with John Riffe, Anthony\r\nHeilman, and Andrew Dreizehn, in which speculation the three associates\r\nwere to furnish the necessary funds, whilst Guttenberg was to pay them\r\none half of any profits, the other half being for himself. After a\r\ncertain time the association broke up, differences arose about the\r\nliquidation, and a lawsuit was the consequence. The documents of this\r\nlawsuit are still in existence; from them it appears that they kept\r\ntheir invention a secret, and called themselves “_Spiegelmachers_,”\r\n(makers of looking-glasses,) which looking-glasses, according to the\r\nevidence of witnesses, had found a very ready sale amongst the pilgrims\r\nwho at that period congregated at Aix-la-Chapelle on the occasion of\r\nsome religious festival. But as apparently no extra number of mirrors\r\nwere sold on that occasion, and there does not appear to have been any\r\nnew invention in the art of making them, it is evident that the\r\nlooking-glasses sold were the _Speculum_ books, which undoubtedly would\r\nbe readily purchased by the pilgrims to the holy shrine. This opinion is\r\nstill more corroborated by the mention made in the evidence of a\r\n_Press_, which could scarcely be used in the manufacture of\r\nlooking-glasses. It is therefore most probable that, as the art of\r\nprinting was at this period still in its infancy, and the printed works\r\nwere sold rather as an imitation or facsimile[565] of the written\r\nmanuscripts, this art was still kept a secret; by so doing, its early\r\npractitioners were not only safe from competition, but also from the\r\nattacks and opposition by which the new invention would have been\r\nassailed by all those connected with the business of transcribing and\r\nilluminating.[566]\r\n\r\nOther pieces of furniture are the CABINET, a common upholsterer’s sign\r\nin the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; the THREE CRICKETS, or\r\nlittle stools, which we gather from a trades token of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, was in Crooked Lane; and the CRADLE, a peculiar sign, occurs in\r\nTaylor’s “Carrier’s Cosmography,” 1637, where he gives a rather curious\r\ninsight into the postal arrangements of that time:--\r\n\r\n  “Those that will send any letter to Edinbourgh, that so they may be\r\n  conveyed to and fro to any parts of the kingdome of Scotland, the\r\n  poste doth lodge at the signe of the _kings armes_ or the CRADLE at\r\n  the upper end of Cheapside, from whence every Monday any that have\r\n  occasion may send.”\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, it did not designate so respectable a business; the\r\n“Compleat Vintner,” 1720, explains the secret arcana of that sign:--\r\n\r\n  “The pregnant Madam drawn aside,\r\n  By promise to be made a bride,\r\n  If near her time and in distress\r\n  For some obscure convenient place,\r\n  Let her but take the pains to waddle\r\n  About till she observes a _Cradle_\r\n  With the foot hanging towards the door,\r\n  And there she may be made secure\r\n  From all the parish plagues and terrors,\r\n  That wait on poor weak woman’s errors.\r\n  But if the head hang tow’rds the house,\r\n  As very often we see it does,\r\n  Avaunt, for she’s a cautious bawd\r\n  Whose business only lies abroad.”\r\n\r\nFrom the last interpretation of this sign to the Colt in the Cradle (see\r\nunder Humorous Signs) is but a step.\r\n\r\nThe TRUNK was the sign of Caleb Swinock, a bookseller in St Paul’s\r\nChurchyard in 1684, for which it is difficult to find any rational\r\nexplanation; almost equally incomprehensible is the sign of the GREEN\r\nBELLOWS, (_le soufflet vert_,) which was that of Johan Stoll and Peter\r\nCesaris, booksellers and printers in the Rue St Jacques, Paris, in\r\n1473.[567] This sign was also to be seen in other towns of France, as in\r\nAbbeville, where a stone bas-relief sign of the seventeenth century,\r\nwith the inscription “_le vert soufflet_,” remains at the present day in\r\nthe front of a house in the Rue des Jacobins. It may have been adopted\r\nin allusion to the occult sciences and alchemy, green being the\r\nemblematical colour of Hope.\r\n\r\nThe GOLDEN CANDLESTICK was the sign of a Marriage Insurance office in\r\nNewgate Street, in 1711, a time when there was a mania for insurance\r\noffices of every description; the THREE CANDLESTICKS occurs on a trades\r\ntoken of the Old Bailey in 1649. A publican in Tamworth, Staffordshire,\r\nhas taken the COFFEE-POT for a sign, probably on the strength of the\r\nderivation of “lucus a non lucendo,” because he sells no coffee; the\r\nROYAL COFFEE-MILL was the more appropriate sign of Paul Greenwood, in\r\nClothfair, for he was a seller of “Coffee-powder.”[568] Then there is\r\nthe SUGAR-LOAF, a common grocer’s sign of former times, the selection of\r\nwhich showed great disinterestedness on their part, the article being\r\nthat on which the least profit was made. Campbell said, in 1757:--\r\n\r\n  “There is indeed one article which they [the Grocers] must sell to\r\n  their loss, sugars. A custom has prevailed (but why?) amongst the\r\n  Grocers, to sell sugar for the prime cost, and are out of pocket by\r\n  the sale, with paper, packthread, and their labour in breaking and\r\n  weighing it out. The expense of some shops in London, for the article\r\n  of paper and packthread for sugars, amounts to £60 or £70 per annum;\r\n  but this they lay upon the other articles. The customer had much\r\n  better allow him a profit upon his sugars, than pay extravagant prices\r\n  for tea and other comodities.”\r\n\r\nAt present, we understand, loaf-sugar is not sold exactly at cost price,\r\nbut moist sugar is, whence many grocers refuse to sell that article to\r\nstrangers unless something else be bought at the same time. At No. 44\r\nFenchurch Street, a very old established grocery firm still carries on\r\nbusiness under the sign of the THREE SUGAR LOAVES. The house presents\r\nmuch the same appearance it had in the last century, with the gilt\r\nsugar-loaves above the doorway, and is one of the few places of business\r\nin London conducted in the ancient style. The small old-fashioned window\r\npanes, the complete absence of all show and decoration, the cleanliness\r\nof the interior, and the quiet order of the assistants in their long\r\nwhite aprons, betoken the respectable old tea-warehouse, and impress the\r\npasser-by with a complete conviction as to the genuineness of its\r\narticles. That the sugar-loaf was not always exclusively a grocer’s\r\nsign, nor the THREE BALLS a pawnbroker’s, appears from the following\r\nadvertisement in the _Postman_, February 3-6, 1711:--\r\n\r\n  “THOMAS SETH at the Sugarloaf in Fore Street, Pawnbroker, is going to\r\n  leave his house, and to leave off the said business: all persons\r\n  concerned are desired to fetch away their Goods on or before the\r\n  fourth of March next, else they will be disposed off and sold.”\r\n\r\nHere is another curious advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “A TANNY MORE [tawny Moor] with short bushy hair, very well shaped, in\r\n  a grey livery lined with yellow, about 17 or 18 years of age, _with a\r\n  silver collar about his neck_ with these directions:--‘Captain George\r\n  Hastings’ Boy, Brigadier in the King’s Horse guards.’ Whosoever brings\r\n  him to the Sugarloaf in the Pall Mall shall have forty shillings\r\n  Reward.”--_London Gazette_, March 23, 1685.\r\n\r\nThe Sugar-loaf is also a public-house sign, though not a very\r\nappropriate one. The BLUE BOWL, suggestive of punch-making, occurs on\r\nthree public-houses in Bristol; but much more significant for a resort\r\nof thirsty souls is that of the THREE FUNNELS, (_les Trois Entonnoirs_,)\r\nwhich in the time of Louis XIV. was the sign of a tavern in Paris,\r\nmostly patronised by the University people. An equally expressive sign,\r\nthe SIEVE, was used by John Johnson, in Aldermansbury, 1669, and\r\n“Richard Harris in Trinity Minories.”\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at kitchen utensils: foremost amongst these ranks the\r\nGRIDIRON, which was very common in the sixteenth century, and may\r\nperhaps have been a jocular rendering of the _Portcullis_. The FRYING\r\nPAN is still a constant ironmonger’s sign--thus in Highcross Street,\r\nLeicester, there is a gigantic gilt specimen with the inscription “the\r\nFamily Fry Pan.” There are trades tokens of “John Vere, at y^{e} _Frying\r\nPan_ in Islington, Mealman,” which, considered in connexion with\r\npancakes, one can understand; but it certainly looks out of place at the\r\ndoor of Samuel Wadsell, bookseller at the GOLDEN FRYING PAN, in\r\nLeadenhall Street, 1680. The COPPER POT (le Pot de Cuivre) at Dijon, in\r\nFrance, was the sign of one of the oldest inns in that country. It was\r\nopened in 1250 and continued till the middle of the seventeenth century.\r\nThe society of the _Mère Folle_ held their meetings at this house.\r\n\r\nThe PEWTER PLATTER occurs both in France and in England; it was famous\r\nas a carriers’ inn in St John Street, Clerkenwell, in 1681. At this inn\r\nCurll’s translators, in pay, were lodged, and had to sleep three in a\r\nbed, and there “he and they were for ever at work to deceive the\r\npublick.”[569] In mediæval Paris it was a common sign, and gave its name\r\nto several streets. Two of the inns victimised by that incorrigible\r\nscamp Villon, bore this sign:--\r\n\r\n  “Le cas advint au Plat d’etain\r\n  Emprès saint Pierre-des-Arsis.”[570]--_Repues Franches._\r\n\r\nProbably it was a very early sign for eating-houses.\r\n\r\nThe PUMP is a common ale-house sign, and occurs as such on a token of\r\nTooley Street, with the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “The Pump runs cleer\r\n  Wh. Ale and Beer.”\r\n\r\nwhich, as Mr Burn (Beaufoy Tokens) observes, may be a travesty of a\r\nverse in Histrio-Mastrix, 1610:--\r\n\r\n  “Yet a verse may run cleare,\r\n  That is tapt out of Beere.”\r\n\r\nAnother token belonging to Chick Lane, West Smithfield, represents a\r\nhand grasping the handle of a pump; and a publican in Old Swinford, who\r\ncombines engineering with his trade, has a similar sign with the words,\r\n“Hands to the Pump.” In the reign of Charles I. there was a\r\npublic-house, the BLUE PUMP, in Blackfriars, near the famous Hollands\r\nLeaguer. It represented a man, evidently a sailor, pumping with all his\r\nmight, and the legend ran:--“Poor Tom’s last refuge.”[571] With the pump\r\nwe may place the BUCKET, which was the sign of a shop in Aldersgate\r\nStreet, of which there are trades tokens extant, and the TUB, the name\r\nof a tavern in Jermyn Street, in the reign of Charles II., as appears\r\nfrom a letter sent, (not written, for she could not write,) by Nell\r\nGwynn, from Windsor in 1684, to her milliner and factotum, addressed “To\r\nMadam Jennings, over against the Tub tavern in Jermyn Street, London.”\r\nAnother utensil, the DUST-PAN, is common with hardware shops. There is\r\none in Islington, at a shop next to the house in which Charles Lamb\r\nlived; at night it is illuminated, and hence called the ILLUMINATED\r\nDUST-PAN. Lastly, there is the HOUR-GLASS, a colossal specimen carved in\r\nwood, in Upper Thames Street, near All Hallows Church, and the GOLDEN\r\nJAR, which was the sign of a china shop, as we see in the _Country\r\nJournal_, or _Craftsman_, for April 25, 1730, where Anne Cibber\r\nacquaints the public that she is removed from Charles Street to the\r\n_Golden Jar_ in Tavistock Street, carrying on two trades which now are\r\nrarely associated in London, viz., “All sorts of chinaware, and the best\r\nteas, coffees, chocolate,” &c. Now-a-days the _jars_, painted red and\r\ngreen, are the usual oilman’s sign, representing those vessels in which\r\noil is kept in Eastern countries, and in which Ali Baba’s forty thieves\r\ncame to such an untimely end. Formerly oil used to be imported in this\r\ncountry in similar jars, hence their adoption as trade emblems.\r\n\r\nWe may close this chapter, not inappropriately with the KEY, a sign once\r\nlargely used, not only by locksmiths, as at present, but by all manners\r\nof shops; thus there was a celebrated tavern, at the corner of Henrietta\r\nStreet, Covent Garden, _circa_ 1690, and many others that could be\r\nmentioned. The GOLDEN KEY is named in an old advertisement, speaking of\r\nsome sports and pastimes which many English gentlemen are now attempting\r\nto revive:--\r\n\r\n  “RICHARD FENNEY, Esquire of Alaxton in Leicestershire, about a\r\n  forthnight since, lost a lanner from that place; she has neither Bells\r\n  nor Varvels; she is a white Hawk, and her long feathers and sarcels\r\n  are both in the blood. If any one give tidings thereof to Mr Lambert\r\n  at the GOLDEN KEY, in Fleet Street, they shall have 40 shillings for\r\n  their pains.”--_Mercurius Publicus_, August 30 to September 6, 1660.\r\n\r\nThe LOCK AND KEY is a sign of a public-house in West Smithfield, and\r\nwas, during the Commonwealth, that of a house in the parish of St\r\nDunstan, belonging to Praise God Barebones, citizen and leather-seller\r\nof London. There is a MS. in the British Museum,[572] containing a\r\npetition of Barebones against Elisabeth and James Spight, the latter an\r\ninfant under age, offered to the court of judicature for determination\r\nof differences touching houses burned or demolished by the fire of 1666.\r\nFrom that paper it appears that Elisabeth Spight paid £40 a year for the\r\nrent of the Lock and Key.\r\n\r\n[543] _London Gazette_, August 28 to Sept. 1, 1679.\r\n\r\n[544] “Itinerarium Curiosum,” 1776, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[545] Letter of John Paston to Sir John Paston, Sept. 21, 1472.\r\n\r\n[546] Marston’s Antonio and Mellida, 1633.\r\n\r\n[547] Tom Brown’s Works, vol. iii, p. 243.\r\n\r\n[548] Tom Brown’s Amusements for the Meridian of London, 1706.\r\n\r\n[549] “It represented a burning lamp, such as some pastry-cooks have to\r\namuse the children, on which geese, monkeys, elephants, dogs, cats,\r\nhares, foxes, and many strange animals are to be seen running after each\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n[550]\r\n\r\n  “My lamp is kept burning by the produce of the East.\r\n  Oil, figs, and currants sold here.”\r\n\r\n[551] There is a drawing of this very curious relic in a number of the\r\n_Illustrated London News_, published shortly after the sale.\r\n\r\n[552] Also demolished to make room for the streets leading to London\r\nBridge.\r\n\r\n[553] Lansdowne MSS.

Thus, Gaspar Hedion (Paral. ad Chron. Conradi) calls\r\nit “novo _scribendi_ genere reperto,” and Fulgosus (Lib. viii., Dict. &\r\nFact. Memor.) says that Guttenberg could “uno die imprimendo plura\r\n_scribere_ quam uno anno calamis.”\r\n\r\n[566] See the whole of the documents of this law-suit in Count Leon de\r\nLaborde’s Débuts de l’Imprimerie à Strasbourg.\r\n\r\n[567] This De Cesaris family seemed to have a predilection for puzzling\r\nsignboards. When Peter de Cesaris, a bookseller and printer in the Rue\r\nSt Jacques, circa 1480, had for a sign the SWAN AND SOLDIER, (_le cygne\r\net soldat_,) in the absence of his colophon, we can only suppose that it\r\nwas a representation of the legend of the Knight of the Swan, _i.e._, a\r\nknight in a boat drawn by a swan. The steel armour of the knight might\r\neasily have bestowed upon him the title of “the soldier.”\r\n\r\n[568] _London Gazette_, Nov. 10-13, 1679.\r\n\r\n[569] _Loyd’s Evening Post_, Jan 9-12, 1767.\r\n\r\n[570]\r\n\r\n  “It happened at the Pewter Platter,\r\n  Near Saint Pierre des Arsis.”\r\n\r\n[571] Whether it would be just to conclude from this that sailors in\r\nthat time went by the generic name of Tom instead of Jack, we leave to\r\nthe reader to judge. That Tom was in former times a more common name\r\nthan now, (owing, it is said, to the respect at one time paid to the\r\ngreat saint Thomas a-Becket,) appears from the many words to which it is\r\nan affix, and from many imaginary names, as:--Tomtit, Tomcat,\r\nTomfoolery, Tomboy, Tommyshop, Tommy, (slang for bread,) double Tom, (a\r\nsort of plough,) Tom the Piper, (in the morris dance,) Tom Tiddler, Tom\r\nof Bedlam, Tom of Westminster, (a bell,) Tom and Jerry, Tom Telltruth,\r\nTom Hickathrift, Tom, (the knave of Trumps,) Whipping Tom, an itinerant\r\nflogger of wandering maids, Tom Tapster, “Tib’s rush for Tom’s\r\nforefingers,” (all’s well that ends well.)\r\n\r\n  “Then every wanton may dance at her will,\r\n  Both _Tomkin_ with _Tomlin_ and Jenkin with Gill.”\r\n\r\n  _Tusser’s Plowman’s Fasting Day_\r\n\r\n[572] Additional MSS., 5079.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nDRESS; PLAIN AND ORNAMENTAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf this class only a few signs are to be found; one of the most common\r\nis the HAT, the usual hatter’s sign, although it may also be found\r\nbefore taverns and public-houses, in which case, however, it is probable\r\nthat it was the previous sign of the house, which the publican on\r\nentering left unaltered; or it may have been used to suggest “a house of\r\ncall” to the trade. The age of each individual hat-sign may sometimes be\r\ngathered from its shape; thus there is one in Whitechapel, made out of\r\ntin, representing the cocked hat worn at the end of the last century; it\r\nis evidently a relic of that time. The continental hatters using this\r\nsign, occasionally indulged in a little humour. A hatter at Ghent in the\r\nsixteenth century added to it this distich:--\r\n\r\n  “Onder den Hoedt\r\n  Schuylt quaedt & goet.”[573]\r\n\r\nAnd a Dutch hatter made a still more unpleasant allusion to the brains\r\nof his customers:--\r\n\r\n  “Hier maakt men sterke hoeden om de hersens in te sluyten\r\n  Opdat het los verstand daar niet mag vliegen buyten.”[574]\r\n\r\nDr Franklin used to tell an amusing story of a journeyman hatter, his\r\ncompanion when young, who on commencing business for himself, was\r\nanxious to get a handsome signboard, with a proper inscription. This he\r\ncomposed himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n  +------------------------+\r\n  | JOHN THOMPSON, HATTER, |\r\n  |  MAKES AND SELLS HATS  |\r\n  |    FOR READY MONEY     |\r\n  +------------------------+\r\n\r\nAbove the inscription was the ordinary figure of a hat. But he thought\r\nhe would submit the composition to his friends for amendment. The first\r\nhe showed it to thought the word “hatter” tautologous, because followed\r\nby the words “makes hats,” which showed he was a hatter; it was struck\r\nout. The next observed that the word “makes” might as well be omitted,\r\nbecause his customers would not care who made the hats; if good, and to\r\ntheir mind, they would buy, by whomsoever made. He struck that out also.\r\nA third said he thought that the words “for ready money” were useless,\r\nas it was not the custom of the place to sell on credit--every one who\r\npurchased expected to pay. These, too, were parted with, and the\r\ninscription then stood, “John Thompson sells Hats.” “_Sells_ Hats!” says\r\nhis next friend; “why, who expects you to give them away? What, then, is\r\nthe use of the word?” It was struck out, and HATS was all that remained\r\nattached to the name John Thompson. Even this inscription, brief as it\r\nwas, was reduced ultimately to “John Thompson,” with the figure of the\r\nhat above it.\r\n\r\nThe HAT AND FEATHERS was almost equally common in those days, when no\r\nfull-fledged gallant could be deemed complete without his fluttering\r\nribbons and plume. The puritanical Philip Stubbe in his “Anatomie of\r\nAbuses,” 1585, is very hard upon this fashion:--\r\n\r\n  “Another sort, (as phantasticall as the rest,) are content with no\r\n  kind of hat, without a great bunch of feathers of divers and sondrie\r\n  colours, peaking on top of their heades, not unlike (I dare not saie)\r\n  cockes combes, but as Sternes of Pride and ensignes of vanitie and\r\n  these fluttering sailes and feathered flagges of defiaunce to virtue,\r\n  (for so they are,) are so advanced in Ailgnia [Anglia] that euery\r\n  child has thē in his Hatte or Cappe. Many get good living by deying\r\n  and selling of them, and not a fewe proue themselues more than fooles\r\n  in wearyng of them.”\r\n\r\nDecker calls the “swell” of his day “our feathered ostrich,” and in his\r\ncomedy of the “Sun’s Darling” he mentions “some alderman’s son wondrous\r\ngiddy and light-headed, one that blew his patrimony away in _feathers_\r\nand tobacco.” There is one sign of the HAT AND FEATHERS still in\r\nexistence, a publican’s, at Grantchester, in Cambridgeshire.\r\n\r\nAnother old hatter’s sign is the HAT AND BEAVER, which at present may be\r\nseen at the door of a publican’s in Leicester. Shopbills of this once\r\ncommon sign occur amongst the Banks Collection, representing a beaver\r\nseated on the edge of a stream, with a hat above him. The relation\r\nbetween the two is evident, and about as gratifying to the beaver as it\r\nwas to the widow of the hanged man to hear the gallows named. The beaver\r\nhats worn in England at the time of Edward III., and long after, were\r\nmade in Flanders and Picardy. From the Privy Purse expenses of Henry\r\nVIII. we see that the king paid in 1532:--\r\n\r\n  “Item, the xxiij day [of October] for a hath and plume for the King in\r\n  Boleyn, xv shillings.”\r\n\r\n“On 27 May MDLV. (ij of Queen Mary) Sir William Cecil [afterwards Lord\r\nBurghley] being then at Callice [Calais] bought [as appears from his MS.\r\nDiary] three hats for his children at xxd each.”\r\n\r\nThe Protestant refugees, however, from Flanders and France, introduced\r\nthe manufacture of these hats into England when they settled in Norwich;\r\nby a statute 5 and 6 Edw. VI., the manufacture of felt and thrummed hats\r\nwas confined to Norwich and the corporate and market towns in that\r\ncounty.[575] As for the shapes of the hats worn at that period we must\r\nagain refer to Stubbe’s satirical account:--\r\n\r\n  “Some tymes they use them sharpe on the crowne, pearking up like the\r\n  speare or shaft of a steeple, standing a quarter of a yarde above the\r\n  crowne of their heades, some more, some lesse, as pleases the\r\n  fantasies of their inconstant mindes; othersome be flat and broad in\r\n  the crowne like the battlements of a house. Another sort have round\r\n  crownes, sometymes with one kinde of bande, sometymes with another,\r\n  now blacke, now whyte, now russet, now red, now green, now yellowe,\r\n  now this, now that, never content, with one colour or fashion two\r\n  daies to an ende.”[576]\r\n\r\nFelt hats for a long time were exclusively worn by the aristocracy. Stow\r\ntells us that “about the beginning of Henry VIII. began the making of\r\nSpanish feltes in England, by Spaniardes and Dutchmen, before which\r\ntime, and long since the English used to ride, and goe winter and sommer\r\nin knitcapps, cloth hoods, and the best sort in silk throm’d Hatts.”\r\nThese caps were enforced by a statute of 13th Queen Elizabeth, which\r\ngives, at the same time, a curious picture of the fashions of that\r\nperiod:--\r\n\r\n  “If any person above six yeares of age, (except _maidens_, _ladies_,\r\n  _gentlewomen_, nobles, knights, gentlemen of twenty marks by year in\r\n  lands, and their heirs, and such as have borne office of worship,)\r\n  have not worn upon the Sundays and Holidays, (except it be in the time\r\n  of his travell out of the citie, towne, or hamlet, where he dwelleth,)\r\n  uppon his head one cap of wool knit, thicked, and dressed in England,\r\n  and onely dressed and finished by some of the trade of cappers, shall\r\n  be fined 3s. 4d. for each day’s transgression.”\r\n\r\nThese caps, termed statute caps, are frequently alluded to by the\r\ndramatists and authors of that period. Rosalind, for instance, in\r\n“Love’s Labour Lost,” taunts her lover with the words: “Well, better\r\nwits have worn plain statute caps.” The act was repealed in the year\r\n1597. The sign of the CAP AND STOCKING, still in Leicester, commemorates\r\nthe once-flourishing trade of that town in those articles. The quantity\r\nof workmen who found occupations in the manufacture of the above-named\r\n“statute caps,” (which came chiefly from Leicestershire and the\r\nsurrounding districts,) was one of the principal reasons why it was so\r\noften protected by parliamentary statutes. Fuller enumerates not less\r\nthan fifteen callings, “besides other exercises,” all employed in the\r\ntrade of capmaking, beginning with the woolcarder, and ending with the\r\nbandmaker. The HAT AND STAR, which occurs on the bill of Master Bates in\r\nSt Paul’s Churchyard, who sold all sorts of fine “caines, whippes,\r\nspurres,”[577] &c., if not a simple quartering of two signs, possibly\r\noriginated in the clasp ornament of precious stones, formerly worn in\r\nthe hat. The LEGHORN HAT, at the end of the last century, was generally\r\na turner’s sign, because the members of that trade sold straw hats\r\nimported from Leghorn. In St John Street, Clerkenwell, there was an old\r\nestablished public-house, and place of resort, called the THREE HATS. It\r\nis mentioned by Bickerstaff in his comedy of “The Hypocrite,” where\r\nMawworm thus alludes to it:--\r\n\r\n  “Till I went after him, [Dr Cantwell,] I was little better than the\r\n  devil, my conscience was tanned with sin, like a piece of neat’s\r\n  leather, and had no more feeling than the sole of my shoe; always a\r\n  roving after fantastical delights; I used to go every Sunday evening\r\n  to the Three Hats at Islington; it’s a public-house . . . mayhap your\r\n  Ladyship may know it. I was a great lover of skittles, too, but now I\r\n  cannot bear them.”\r\n\r\nAt this house the earliest prototypes of Astley used to perform in 1758.\r\nThere was Thomas, an Irishman, surnamed Tartar; then came Johnson,\r\nSampson, Price, and Cunningham. The great Dr Johnson went here to see\r\nhis namesake.\r\n\r\n  “Such a man, sir, said he, should be encouraged; for his performance\r\n  show the extent of human powers in one instance, and thus tend to\r\n  raise our opinion of the faculties of man. He shows what may be\r\n  obtained by persevering application; so that every man may hope, by\r\n  giving as much application, although, perhaps, he may never ride three\r\n  horses at a time, or dance upon a wire, yet he may be equally expert\r\n  in whatever profession he has chosen to pursue.”\r\n\r\nRoyalty also visited the place: “Yesterday his Royal Highness the Duke\r\nof York was at the Three Hats, Islington, to see the extraordinary feats\r\nof horsemanship exhibited there. There were near five hundred\r\nspectators.”[578] Sampson’s wife was the first female equestrian.\r\n\r\n  HORSEMANSHIP\r\n\r\n  _At Mr Dingley’s, the Three Hats, Islington._\r\n\r\n  “MR SAMPSON begs leave to inform the public, that besides the usual\r\n  feats which he exhibits, Mrs Sampson, to diversify the entertainment,\r\n  and prove that the fair sex are by no means inferior to the male,\r\n  either in Courage or Agility, will, this and every Evening during the\r\n  Summer, perform various exercises in the same art, in which she hopes\r\n  to acquit herself to the universal approbation of those Ladies and\r\n  Gentlemen whose curiosity may induce them to honour her attempt with\r\n  their company.”[579]\r\n\r\nThe Three Hats occurs amongst the trades tokens of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. There is one of the THREE HATS AND NAG’S HEAD in Southwark. In\r\nthe seventeenth century the sign of the Three Hats at Leeuwarden, in\r\nFriesland, was accompanied by the following stanza:--\r\n\r\n  “Dit is in de drie Hoeden\r\n  Om ’t hoofd te behoeden,\r\n  Voor wind en koud.\r\n  Tromp was stout,\r\n  Voor der staten kroon,\r\n  Hier maakt men hoeden schoon.”[580]\r\n\r\nThe LOCKS OF HAIR was the very appropriate sign of John Allen, a\r\nhairdresser on London Bridge in the last century, who sold “all sorts of\r\nhair, Curled or Uncurled; Bags, Roses, Cauls, Ribbons, Weaving Silk,\r\nSewing Cards, and Blocks. With all Goods made use of by Peruke makers,\r\nat the lowest prices.”[581] The locks of hair were represented curled\r\nand tied. This sign appears to have been not unusual with the\r\nhairdressers of a former age. In 1649, there was one in St\r\nDunstan’s-in-the-East, who had the LOCK AND SHEARS; which are\r\nrepresented on his trades token by a lock of hair between a pair of\r\nshears, intimating that the “unlovely lovelocks” were curtailed by him.\r\nWhat he would require the tokens for in his profession (they were used\r\nas farthings) it is difficult to guess, as apparently no such small\r\nchange was needed. This sign was in accordance with the spirit of the\r\ntimes; short hair was the unmistakable mark of the godly puritan, just\r\nas the straggling love-lock hanging over the shoulder denoted the\r\ncavalier. For this reason, Decker advises the young cavalier Gull:--\r\n\r\n  “Thy hair, whose length before the rigorous edge of any puritanical\r\n  pair of scissors should shorten the breadth of a finger, let the three\r\n  house-wifely spinsters of Destiny rather curtail the thread of thy\r\n  life. Oh, no! long hair is the only net that women spread abroad to\r\n  entrap man in, and why should not men be as far above women in that\r\n  comodity as they go far beyond them in others.”[582]\r\n\r\nThe PERIWIG was another common hairdresser’s sign. Even this had to\r\nsubmit to the favourite blue colour, for amongst the Banks bills there\r\nis one of John Thompson, in Brewer Street, Golden Square, who lived at\r\nthe BLUE PERUKE AND STAR. The star evidently was the original sign, to\r\nwhich the wig had been added on account of the profession of the\r\noccupant of the house.\r\n\r\nThe WHITE PERUKE, in Maiden Lane, was the sign of the barber, at whose\r\nlodgings Voltaire lived when on a visit to London; some of his letters\r\nto Swift are dated from that place. A white periwig was a highly\r\nfashionable object:--“Now, I think he looks very humorous and agreeable;\r\nI vow, in a _white periwig_ he might do mischief; could he but talk and\r\ntake snuff, there’s never a fop in town wou’d go beyond him.”--_Cibber’s\r\nDouble Gallant_, 1707. So Shadwell, in “The Humorist,” 1671, describes\r\nBrisk, one of the _dramatis personæ_, as “a fellow that never wore a\r\nnoble and polite garniture, or a _white periwig_.” Well might the\r\nbarbers give the peruke the honour of this signboard, for the profits on\r\nthat article must have been enormous. In Charles II.’s time, for\r\ninstance, a fine peruke cost as much as £50; and hence the great respect\r\nCibber paid to the one he wore in the character of Sir Fopling Flutter,\r\nwhich was brought on the stage in a sedan, and put on before the public.\r\nAs the glory of Miltiades prevented Epaminondas from sleeping, so the\r\nbeauty of this periwig disturbed the slumbers of Mr (afterwards Colonel)\r\nBrett, who in the end bought it from Cibber.[583] The thieves as well as\r\nthe beaux knew the value of those wigs, and practised all manner of\r\ntricks to obtain them. Sometimes a boy, carried in a basket on the\r\nshoulders of a man, would snatch the “curly honour” off the head of the\r\nunsuspecting beau;[584] at other times they would cut holes in the\r\nleather backs of the coaches,[585] whilst the highwaymen were sure to\r\ninclude the periwig with the rest of the booty captured on the road.\r\nThough this article is now shorn of its honours, there is still a\r\npublican at Great Redisham, Suffolk, who carries on his trade under the\r\nsign of the WIG.\r\n\r\nThe French have a sign quite as absurd as our BLUE PERUKE--viz., The\r\nGOLDEN BEARD, (_la barbe d’or_,) which is carved in stone in the Rue des\r\nBourdonnais, Paris, and also in the Marché aux Herbes, Amiens: both\r\nthese signs date from the eighteenth century, but their origin is much\r\nolder, as appears from the following:--\r\n\r\n  “The Duke of Lorraine, after the Battle of Nancy, wherein he killed\r\n  Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, went in procession to visit the\r\n  body, clothed in deep mourning, with a _golden beard_ fixed on, that\r\n  reached down to his waist, (after the manner of the old heroes that\r\n  were knighted for their prowess, who, on a signal victory over an\r\n  enemy, were honoured with such a beard.)”--_Richardsoniana_, London,\r\n  1776, p. 47.\r\n\r\nThe ANODYNE NECKLACE was as notorious in the eighteenth century, as\r\nHolloway’s Pills and Rowland’s Macassar Oil are in our day.\r\nAdvertisements concerning it were continually appearing in the papers:--\r\n\r\n  “THE Anodyne Necklace for children’s teeth, women in labour, and\r\n  distempers of the head; price 5s. Recommended by Dr Chamberlain. Sold\r\n  up one pair of stairs at the sign of the Anodyne Necklace, without\r\n  Temple Bar; at the SPANISH LADY at the Royal Exchange, next\r\n  Threadneedle Street; at the INDIAN HANDKERCHIEF, facing the New Stairs\r\n  in Wapping,” &c.[586]\r\n\r\nTo attract attention, there was frequently some book of not very\r\ndelicate character, advertised as “given away gratis” at this house. But\r\nas this kind of literature was sure to find a great many readers--more\r\nespecially when the book could be had for nothing--a restriction was\r\nsometimes added that “this curious book will not be given away to any\r\nboys or girls, or any paultry person.” Such a pamphlet, for instance,\r\nwas:--\r\n\r\n  “THE RABBIT-AFFAIR made clear in a full account of the whole matter,\r\n  with the pictures engraved of the pretended rabbit-breeder herself,\r\n  Mary Tofts, and of the rabbits, and of the persons who attended her\r\n  during her pretended deliveries, showing who were and who were not\r\n  deceived by her. ’Tis given gratis nowhere, but only up one pair of\r\n  stairs at the sign of the Anodyne Necklace, recommended by Dr\r\n  Chamberlain,” &c.--_Daily Courant_, Jan. 11, 1726.\r\n\r\nThis alluded to one of the most impudent frauds ever committed. A\r\ncertain profligate woman, Mary Tofts by name, a native of Godalming, in\r\nSurrey, pretended to give birth to rabbits. The first delivery was a\r\nfamily of seventeen; she actually found people who believed her, and\r\ngave their attention to this phenomenon. Amongst them were Sir Richard\r\nManningham, Dr St André, surgeon and anatomist to his Majesty, Dr\r\nMowbray, &c. By these gentlemen she was brought to Lacy’s Bagnio, and\r\nthe case was watched with intense interest; yet she succeeded in\r\nbaffling and deluding their attention. At last the fraud came out by one\r\nof her accomplices informing upon her. Prints, books, and ballads were\r\npublished upon the subject, Dr St André coming in for an extra share of\r\nridicule; but whether the woman was in any way punished, is not on\r\nrecord. The last information respecting her was in the _Weekly\r\nMiscellany_, April 19, 1740:--“The celebrated rabbit-woman, of\r\nGodalmin’, in Surrey, was committed to Guilford gaol for receiving\r\nstolen goods.” She died in January 1763.\r\n\r\nThe PEARL OF VENICE is named in an advertisement of a watch lost, “made\r\nat Paris, not so broad as a shilling, in a case of black leather with\r\ngold nails.”[587] It was the sign of “Mr Leroy, in St James’ Street,\r\nCovent Garding.” The pearls of Venice were celebrated:--\r\n\r\n                “Is your pearl orient, sir?\r\n  _Corv._ _Venice was never owner of the like._”\r\n\r\n  --BEN JONSON, _The Fox_, a. i., s. i.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that city was celebrated for its mock jewellery and\r\nglass imitations.\r\n\r\nFrom the Bagford shopbills, it appears that the BLUE BODDICE was, in\r\nQueen Anne’s reign, a milliner’s shop in the Long Walk, near\r\nChristchurch Hospital. At the same period another member of the same\r\n_fraternity_ (there were men-milliners in those days) had the HOOD AND\r\nSCARF, articles of female apparel; this shop was in Cornhill, “over\r\nagainst Wills’ Coffee-house.”[588] At the present time there is in the\r\nNorth a public-house called the BLUE STOOPS; this also seems to refer to\r\nan ancient garment, worn in the beginning of the seventeenth century,\r\nand named by Ben Jonson--“Alchymist,” a. iv., s. ii.--“Your Spanish\r\nstoop is the best garment.”\r\n\r\nThe BONNY CRAVAT, at Woodchurch, Tenterden, to judge from the adjective,\r\nseems rather to have been suggested by the old song of “Jenny, come tie\r\nmy bonny cravat,” than by the introduction of the cravat as an article\r\nof dress. The fashion is said to have been brought over from Germany,\r\nin the seventeenth century, by some of the young French nobility, who\r\nhad served the emperor in the wars against the Turks, and had copied\r\nthis garment from the _Croats_, whence the name.\r\n\r\nThe DOUBLET, formerly the HARROW AND DOUBLET,[589] is still the sign of\r\nan iron warehouse in Upper Thames Street; it bears the date 1720, and\r\nthe letters T. C., the initials of one of the Crowley family, to whom\r\nthis warehouse has belonged “time out of mind.” It is made of cast and\r\npainted iron, and is said to represent the leather doublet in which the\r\nfounder of the firm came to London as a day-labourer. The doublet was a\r\nkind of vestment which originated from the gambason or pourpoint worn\r\nunder the armour; sleeves were added when it was worn without armour,\r\nand so it became a universal garment.\r\n\r\nThere are trades tokens extant of the CHILD-COAT, in Whitecross Street,\r\nprobably a shop where children’s apparel was sold. Randle Holme, in his\r\nheraldic _Omnium Gatherum_, b. iii., ch. i, p. 18, gives a\r\nrepresentation of a child’s coat, which is very similar to the\r\n“Knickerbocker” suit of the present day, with a short kilt added to it.\r\nHe adds the following explanation:--“A boy’s coat is the last coat used\r\nfor boys, after which they are put into breeches. If it has hanging\r\nsleeves, they would term it a child’s coat.” In the same manner as the\r\nchild’s coat, the MINISTER’S GOWN figured at the door of the shop where\r\nthis article was sold. There is a shopbill of such a one in Booksellers’\r\nRow, St Paul’s Churchyard, among the Bagford bills.\r\n\r\nThe TABARD was the well-known inn in Southwark whence Chaucer and the\r\nother pilgrims started on their way to Canterbury. Mr Edmund Ollier has\r\nrecently contributed a very interesting paper on this old inn to _All\r\nthe Year Round_, and several paragraphs have appeared in other journals\r\nupon the same subject. A very few words, therefore, will be sufficient\r\nfor the present purpose. Originally, it was the property of the Abbot of\r\nHyde, near Winchester, who had his town residence within the inn-yard.\r\nThe earliest record relating to this property is in 33d Edw. I., (1304,)\r\nwhen the Abbot and convent of Hyde purchased of William of Lategareshall\r\ntwo houses in Southwark, held by the Archbishop of Canterbury at the\r\nannual rent of 5s. 1½d., and suit to his court in Southwark, and 1d. a\r\nyear for a purpresture of one foot wide on the king’s highway; £4 per\r\nannum to John de Tymberhutts, and 3s. to the Prior and convent of St\r\nMary Overie, in Southwark; value clear, 40s.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact on record that Henry Bayley, the hosteller of the Tabard,\r\nwas one of the burgesses who represented the borough of Southwark in the\r\nParliament held in Westminster in the 50th Edw. III., (1376;) and he was\r\nagain returned to the Parliament held at Gloucester in the 2d Richard\r\nII., in 1378.[590] The tavern itself is named, at the very period when\r\nChaucer’s poem is supposed to have been written, in one of the rolls of\r\nParliament, where, 5th Richard II., (1381,) in a list of malefactors who\r\nhad participated in the rebellion of Jack Cade, occurs the name of\r\n“Joh’es Brewersman, manens apud le Tabbard, London.” Stow thus notices\r\nthe old inn:--\r\n\r\n  “From thence to London, on the same side, be many fair inns for\r\n  receipt of travellers, by their signs--the SPURRE, CHRISTOPHER, BULL,\r\n  QUEEN’S HEAD, TABARDE, GEORGE, HART, KING’S HEAD, &c. Amongst the\r\n  which the most ancient is the Tabard; so called of the sign, which, as\r\n  we now term it, is a jacket or sleeveless coat, whole before, open on\r\n  both sides, with a square collar, winged at the shoulders, a stately\r\n  garment of old time, commonly worn of noblemen and others, both at\r\n  home and abroad in the wars, but then, (to wit, in the wars,) their\r\n  arms embroidered or otherwise depict upon them, that any man by his\r\n  coat of arms might be known from others; but now these tabardes are\r\n  only worn by the heralds, and be called their coate of armes in\r\n  service.”--_Stow_, p. 154.\r\n\r\nFormerly there stood in the road, in front of the Tabard, a beam laid\r\ncrosswise upon two uprights, upon which was the following\r\ninscription:--“This is the Inne where Sir Jeffrey Chaucer and the\r\nnine-and-twenty pilgrims lay in their journey to Canterbury, anno 1583.”\r\nOver this the sign was hung, but that disappeared with the rest of them\r\nin 1766. The writing of this inscription seemed ancient, yet Tyrwhitt is\r\nof opinion that it was not older than the seventeenth century, since\r\nSpeght, who describes the Tabard in his edition of Chaucer 1602, does\r\nnot mention it. Perhaps it was put up after the fire of 1676, when the\r\nTabard changed its name into the TALBOT.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the inn is known by the name of the Talbot; and\r\nalthough the building is by no means the same that sheltered Chaucer and\r\nhis merry pilgrims, yet it is full of traditionary lore concerning them.\r\nIn the centre of the gallery there was a picture, said to be by Blake,\r\nand well painted, representing the Canterbury Pilgrimage, almost\r\ninvisible from dirt, age, and smoke. Behind this picture was a door\r\nopening into a lofty passage, with rooms on either side, one of which,\r\non the right hand, was still designated as the Pilgrims’ Room. The house\r\nwas repaired in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and from that period,\r\nprobably, dated the fireplace, carved oak panels, and other parts spared\r\nby the fire of 1676, which were still to be seen in the beginning of\r\nthis century.\r\n\r\nAs leather breeches were much used for riding in the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries, the occupations of breeches-maker and glover were\r\nfrequently combined; hence the sign of the BREECHES AND GLOVE on old\r\nLondon Bridge, the shop of “Walter Watkins, Breeches-maker,\r\nLeather-seller, and Glover.” But what made a Cornish publican of the\r\npresent day, (at Camelford,) choose the sign of the COTTON BREECHES, is\r\nmore than we can pretend to explain.\r\n\r\nSTOCKINGS or LEGS are of constant occurrence in the seventeenth century\r\ntrades tokens, as the signs of hosiers--frequently real, not painted,\r\nstockings were suspended at the door.\r\n\r\n  “On hosier’s poles depending stockings ty’d,\r\n  Flag with the slacken’d gale from side to side.”--GAY’S _Trivia_.\r\n\r\nBoots and shoes occur in greater variety and abundance than any other\r\narticle of dress. The BOOT is a very common inn sign, either owing to\r\nthe thirsty reputation of cobblers, or from the premises where they are\r\nfound having been at one time occupied by shoemakers. The BOOT AND\r\nSLIPPER may be seen at Smethwick, near Birmingham; the GOLDEN SLIPPER at\r\nGoodrange, in West Riding; the HAND AND SLIPPERS was a sign in Long\r\nLane, Smithfield, in 1750. THE SHOE AND SLAP occurs in the following\r\nhandbill:--\r\n\r\n  “AT MR CROOME’S, at the sign of the Shoe and Slap, near the Hospital\r\n  Gate, in West Smithfield, is to be seen\r\n  THE WONDER OF NATURE,\r\n\r\n  A GIRL above Sixteen Years of Age, born in Cheshire, and not above\r\n  Eighteen inches long, having shed her Teeth seven several Times, and\r\n  not a perfect Bone in any Part of her, only the Head, yet she hath all\r\n  her senses to Admiration, and Discourses, Reads very well, Sings,\r\n  Whistles, and all very pleasant to hear.\r\n\r\n  “_Sept._ 4, 1667.\r\n  ‘God save the King.’”\r\n\r\nA slap was a kind of “ladies shoe, with a loose sole,”[591] the origin,\r\nprobably, of the present word _slipper_. Another kind of shoe is also\r\nmentioned in an advertisement--the LACED SHOE in Chancery Lane.[592]\r\n“Laced shoes,” says Randle Holme, “have the over leathers and edges of\r\nthe shoe laced in orderly courses with narrow galloon lace of any\r\ncolour;” this places the use of laced boots much earlier than we would\r\nhave been apt to imagine. The CLOG is often used as a shoemaker’s sign\r\nin Lancashire and the midland counties, and also in those parts of\r\nLondon where that article is worn. The FIVE CLOGS was, in 1718, the sign\r\nof William Wright, a quack, who lived over against Prescott Street,\r\nGoodman’s Fields.[593] Perhaps he occupied apartments at a clog-maker’s.\r\nEven the primitive WOODEN SHOE (_sabot_) of France has figured as a\r\ntavern sign in that country. In a farce of the fourteenth century,\r\nentitled, “Pernet qui va au Vin,” the husband names the following\r\ntaverns:--\r\n\r\n  “Au _Sabot_ ou à la _Lanterne_\r\n  J’ai mis en oubli la taverne.”\r\n\r\nRonsard addressed some of his verses to the hostess of this tavern,\r\nwhich was situated in the Faubourg St Marcel:--\r\n\r\n  “Je ne suis point, ma guerrière Cassandre,\r\n  Ni Mirmidon, ni Dolope soudard.”\r\n\r\n  “Il n’y a personne,” says Furretière in his _Roman Bourgeois_, “qui ne\r\n  se figure qu’on parle d’une Pentasilée ou d’une Talestris; cepandant\r\n  cette guerrière Cassandre n’était reellement qu’une grande hallebreda\r\n  qui tenit le cabaret du Sabot dans le faubourg Saint Marcel.”[594]\r\n\r\nThis sign has given its name to a street in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe PATTEN, the quaint little contrivance in which our\r\ngreat-grandmothers tripped through the winter’s sludge, was the sign of\r\na toy-shop in the Haymarket, “over against Great Suffolk Street, and by\r\nPall Mall;”[595] at the present day it is still extant as a fishmonger’s\r\nshop in Whitecross Street, near the prison.\r\n\r\nThe very common sign of the STAR AND GARTER refers to the insignia of\r\nthe Order of the Garter. Anciently it was simply called the GARTER, and\r\nthus it is designated by Shakespeare in his “Merry Wives of Windsor.”\r\nCharles I. added the star to the insignia, and his example was followed\r\non the signboard. At that time the Garter was treated with a great deal\r\nmore respect than at present, for Sandford, Lancaster Herald in 1686,\r\ncomplained that several coffee-houses had the sign of the Garter with\r\ncoffee-pots, &c., painted inside, which he considered downright\r\ndesecration; hence, order was given to those offenders, “to amend the\r\nsame, or else they should be pulled down.”\r\n\r\nThe Garter Inn at Windsor, where Falstaff lived in such grand style, “as\r\nan emperor in his expense,” was not a creation of Shakespeare’s fancy,\r\nbut did really exist, and most probably on the same site at present\r\noccupied by the Star and Garter.[596] The first Star and Garter at\r\nRichmond was built in 1738/9, on what was then a portion of the waste of\r\nPetersham Common; it was rented at 40s. a year. A drawing by Hearne, of\r\nthe comparatively insignificant tenement then raised, is still preserved\r\nat the hotel.\r\n\r\nIt was also the sign of a famous ordinary in Pall Mall. Here the Duke of\r\nOrmond, in the reign of Queen Anne, gave a dinner to a few friends, and\r\nwas charged £21, 6s. 8d. for the two courses, each of four dishes,\r\nwithout any wine or dessert, which, considering the value of money in\r\nthose days, was certainly a considerable sum. In this house, in 1765,\r\nLord Byron, the poet’s grandfather, killed Mr Chaworth in an irregular\r\nduel, the result of a dispute whether Mr Chaworth, who preserved his\r\ngame, or Lord Byron, who did not, had more game on his estate. About the\r\nsame time there was another Star and Garter tavern at the end of Burton\r\nStreet, near the famous Five Fields in Chelsea, “a place where robbers\r\nlie in wait,”[597] the site now occupied by Eaton Square and Belgrave\r\nSquare. At this tavern, Johnson the equestrian rode in July 1762, for\r\nthe gratification of the Cherokee king, when on a visit in this country.\r\nThe newspapers of the day describe the feats he performed:--“He rides\r\nthree horses, and when in full speed, tosses his cap and catches it\r\nseveral times; he stands with both feet on the horse whilst it goes\r\nthree times round the green in full speed,” and similar “astounding”\r\nacts, which would now be thought very little of.\r\n\r\nThe GLOVE is, in France, the common sign of the glove-makers; generally\r\nit is a colossal representation of a glove in tin painted red. This\r\narticle of dress has had more honour conferred upon it than any other;\r\nanciently it was given, by way of delivery or investiture, in sales and\r\nconveyances of lands and goods; it was worn by magistrates on certain\r\noccasions, presented to them on others; it was the challenge and sacred\r\npledge of a duel; the rural bridegroom in the time of Queen Elizabeth\r\nwore gloves on his hat as a sign of good husbandry; noblemen wore their\r\nladies’ gloves in front of their hats; in some parts of England it used\r\nto be the custom to hang a pair of white gloves on the pew of unmarried\r\nvillagers, who had died in the flower of their youth; it is used in\r\nmarriage by proxy, and is connected with innumerable other customs and\r\nceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe FAN, the CROWNED FAN, the TWO FANS, &c., were the ordinary signs of\r\nmilliners who sold fans.\r\n\r\nThe PINCUSHION is the sign of a public-house at Wyberton, Boston, but\r\nwhy chosen it is difficult to say; and the PURSE occurs amongst the\r\ntrades tokens of W. Smithfield, with the date 1669. This last object was\r\nalso the sign of one of the taverns visited at Barnet by Drunken\r\nBarnaby, where he had the misfortune with the bears.\r\n\r\nThe RING was the sign of one of the booksellers in Little Britain, in\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne; and the GOLDEN RING was, in 1723, the sign of\r\nG. Coniers on Ludgate Hill, who published a black letter edition of “The\r\nMerry Tales of the Mad Men of Gotam.” An old tradition that Guttenberg\r\nreceived the first idea of printing from the seal of his ring impressed\r\nin wax, may have led those booksellers to adopt that object for their\r\nsign.\r\n\r\n  “Respicit archetypos auri vestigia lustrans,\r\n    Et secum tacitus talia verba refert:\r\n  Quam belle pandit certas hæc orbita voces,\r\n    Monstrat et exactis apta reperta libris.”[598]\r\n\r\nA red or a bipartite UMBRELLA or PARASOL is the invariable sign of the\r\numbrella-maker. This now indispensable article was brought into fashion\r\nby Hanway the philanthropist, towards the end of the eighteenth century.\r\nBefore his time, a cloak was the only protection against a shower. Pepys\r\nwrites in his Diary, “This day in the afternoon, stepping with the Duke\r\nof York into St James’ Park, it rained, and I was forced to lend the\r\nduke my cloak, which he wore through the park.” On another occasion\r\nPepys was out with no less than four ladies, “and it rained all the way,\r\nit troubled us; but, however, my cloak kept us all dry.” Pepys\r\nsheltering the four ladies under his cloak of charity would make a very\r\npretty picture. In the reign of Queen Anne, good housewives defied the\r\nwinter’s shower, “underneath th’ umbrella’s oily shed,”[599] but Hanway\r\nwas the first who, braving laughter and sarcasm, accustomed the\r\nLondoners to the sight of a man carrying that useful contrivance. John\r\nPugh, who wrote Hanway’s life, says:--\r\n\r\n  “When it rained, a small _parapluie_ defended his face and wig; thus\r\n  he was always prepared to enter into any company without impropriety\r\n  or the appearance of negligence. And he was the first man who ventured\r\n  to walk the streets of London with an umbrella over his head; after\r\n  carrying one near thirty years he saw them come into general use.”\r\n\r\nThere is a small umbrella shop in Old Street, Shoreditch, called the\r\n_Umbrella Hospital_; two placards are in the window, one setting forth\r\nthe analogy between a human being and an umbrella, the second giving a\r\nlist of the prices charged for curing the several ills an umbrella is\r\nheir to, thus:--\r\n\r\n                                                  _s._ _d._\r\n  RESTORING A BROKEN rib,                          0    6\r\n  RESTORING a spine,                               0    6\r\n  INSERTING a new spine,                           1    0\r\n  RESUSCITATING the muscularia,                    0    6\r\n  A NEW membranous attachment,                     2    6\r\n  RESTORING a shattered constitution,              1    0\r\n  SETTING a dislocated neck,                       0    6\r\n  RESTORING a broken neck,                         0    9\r\n  A NEW set of nerves,                             1    0\r\n  A NEW rib,                                       0    6\r\n  A NEW muscle,                                    0    3\r\n  A NEW motive power,                              0    6\r\n  A CRENATED attachment,                           0    6\r\n  RESTORING the muscular power,                    1    6\r\n  FIXING on a new head,                            0    3\r\n  SUPPLYING a new head,                            1    0\r\n\r\n[573]\r\n\r\n  “The hat\r\n  Covers evil and good.”\r\n\r\n[574]\r\n\r\n  “Strong hats made here to enclose the head,\r\n  In order that the soft (loose) brains may be kept together.”\r\n\r\n[575] J. S.

One of the theatres, where Shakespeare used to\r\nperform, was called The Globe, from its sign representing Atlas\r\nsupporting the world. It was accompanied by the motto, TOTUS MUNDUS AGIT\r\nHISTRIONEM; upon which Ben Jonson made the following epigram:--\r\n\r\n  “If but _stage actors_ all the world displays,\r\n  Where shall we find spectators to their plays?”\r\n\r\nTo which Shakespeare is said to have returned this answer:--\r\n\r\n  “Little or much of what we see we do,\r\n  We are all actors and spectators too.”\r\n\r\nThe house stood on the Bankside, Southwark, and was burnt down in June\r\n1613, having been set on fire during one of the plays by a piece of\r\nwadding fired from a cannon falling on the thatched roof. It was\r\nrebuilt, but finally taken down in 1644 to make room for\r\ndwelling-houses.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous Globe taverns stood, till the beginning of this\r\ncentury, in Fleet Street. It had been one of the favourite haunts of\r\nOliver Goldsmith, who, it appears, was never tired of hearing a certain\r\n“tun of a man” sing “Nottingham Ale.” Goldsmith’s face was so well known\r\nhere that a wealthy pork-butcher, another _habitué_ of the house, used\r\nto drink to him in the familiar words, “Come, Noll, old boy, here’s my\r\nservice to you.” Several actors, also, “used” the house,--amongst\r\nothers, the centenarian Macklin, Tom King, and Dunstall. Many amusing\r\nanecdotes concerning the place have been preserved in the “Fruits of\r\nExperience,” a delightful book of city gossip, written in his eightieth\r\nyear by Joseph Brasbridge, a silversmith in Fleet Street. Brasbridge was\r\na constant visitor at this tavern.\r\n\r\nAt Aldborough, near Boroughbridge, there is a Globe public-house, in\r\nwhich a tessellated pavement, part of a Roman villa, may be seen. The\r\npublican informs passers-by of this by the following inscription on his\r\nsignboard:--\r\n\r\n  “This is the ancient manor-house, and in it you may see\r\n  The Romans work a great curiositee.”\r\n\r\nAnd the absence of the apostrophe certainly makes it so. Finally, John\r\nPartridge, the almanac-making shoemaker, so amusingly ridiculed in the\r\n_Tatler_, lived at the Globe in Salisbury Street. From the pursuits of\r\nthat great man, we may surmise his globe to have been a celestial one.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Globe was gilt, “for a difference.” Thus the GOLDEN GLOBE\r\nwas the sign of William Herbert, printseller, and editor of Joseph\r\nAmes’s well-known work on “Typographical Antiquities.” This shop was\r\nunder the Piazza on London Bridge, where he continued till 1758, when\r\nthe house was taken down.\r\n\r\nOf all the signs which may be termed “Geographical,” those referring to\r\nour own island are, of course, the most common in this country.\r\nBRITANNIA is very general. Hone, in his “Every-day Book,” mentions a\r\npublic-house in the country where London porter was sold, and the figure\r\nof Britannia was represented in a languishing, reclining posture, with\r\nthe motto,\r\n\r\n  “PRAY, SUP-PORTER.”\r\n\r\nThe first inhabitants are commemorated by the sign of the ANCIENT\r\nBRITON; but this is not one of the “Cærulei Britanni,” though _true\r\nblue_ for all that, but refers simply to a true patriot in the best\r\nsense of the word. Thus Boswell uses the expression in one of his\r\nletters to Dr Johnson:--\r\n\r\n  “I trust that you will be liberal enough to make allowance for my\r\n  differing from you on two points, [the Middlesex election and the\r\n  American war,] when my general principles of government are according\r\n  to your own heart, and when, at a crisis of doubtful event, I stand\r\n  forth with honest zeal as an _ancient_ and _faithful Briton_.”\r\n\r\nThat this is the meaning attached to the word is evident from other\r\nsigns of the same family, as TRUE BRITON, GENEROUS BRITON, &c., all\r\ncommon signatures to political letters in the newspapers of the Junius\r\nperiod. The modern JOHN BULL, and the still later OLD ENGLISH GENTLEMAN,\r\ndescend from the same stock, and are all equally common.\r\n\r\nENGLAND, SCOTLAND, AND IRELAND was, in 1673, the sign of John Thornton,\r\nin the Minories, hydrographer to the Hon. East India Company. As he also\r\nsold maps, he had probably a map of the United Kingdom as his sign.\r\nFormerly signs representing buildings or localities in London were\r\ncommon, though generally they bore very little resemblance to the places\r\nintended. Among the trades tokens we find the EXCHANGE, a tavern in the\r\nPoultry in 1651; the EAST INDIA HOUSE, in Leadenhall Street, like most\r\nof this description of signs, prompted by the vicinity of the building\r\nrepresented; CHARING CROSS, the sign of a shop in that locality where\r\nthey sold canaries in 1699, and also a sign at Norwich in 1750; THE OLD\r\nPRISON, in Whitechapel--this Old Prison was intended for King’s Cross;\r\nCAMDEN HOUSE, in Maiden Lane, 1668,--this must have been in honour of\r\nBaptist Hicks, the opulent mercer, at the White Bear, in Cheapside, who\r\ndied as Viscount Camden in 1628. He built Hicks Hall on Clerkenwell\r\nGreen, and presented it to the county magistrates as their\r\nsession-house.\r\n\r\nFurther, there was the TEMPLE, the sign of Mr Buck, bookseller, near the\r\nInner Temple Gate, in Fleet Street, in 1700; and at the same period,\r\nHYDE PARK, a shop or tavern in Gray’s Inn Lane. A public-house in Bridge\r\nRow, Chelsea, mentioned before 1750, and still in existence, bears the\r\nname of the CHELSEA WATERWORKS. The Waterworks, after which it was\r\nnamed, were constructed _circa_ 1724; a canal was dug from the Thames,\r\nnear Ranelagh, to Pimlico, where an engine was placed for the purpose of\r\nraising the water into pipes, which conveyed it to Chelsea, Westminster,\r\nand various parts of western London. The reservoirs in Hyde and Green\r\nPark were supplied by pipes from the Chelsea Waterworks, which, in 1767,\r\nyielded daily 1740 tons.\r\n\r\nThe LANCASHIRE WITCH, a sign of an exhibition of shell-work and\r\npetrifactions in Shoreditch, 1754, was doubtless named after our old\r\nfriend, Mother Shipton, born near the Petrifying Well at Knaresborough.\r\n\r\nEven on the Continent we meet with a London sign,--viz., at Verona,\r\nwhere, in 1825, the TOWER OF LONDON was one of the inns which\r\nrecommended itself to English travellers in the following grand\r\ncircular:--\r\n\r\n  “_Circulatory._--The old inn of London’s Tower, placed among the more\r\n  agreeable situation of Verona’s Course, belonging at Sir Theodosius\r\n  Ziguoni, restored by the decorum most indulgent to good things, of\r\n  life’s eases, which are favoured from every art at same inn, with all\r\n  object that is concern’d, conveniency of stage-coaches, proper horses,\r\n  and good foragers, and coach-house; do offers at innkeeper the\r\n  constant hope to be honoured from a great concourse, where politeness,\r\n  good genius of meats to delight of nations, round table, [table\r\n  d’hôte,] coffee-house, hackney-coach, men servant of place, swiftness\r\n  of service, and moderacion of prices, shall arrive to accomplish in\r\n  him all satisfaction, and at Sir’s who will do the favour honouring\r\n  him a very assur’d kindness.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.\r\n\r\nVER GALANT.\r\n\r\n(Rue Henri, Lyons, 1759.)\r\n\r\nGOAT IN BOOTS.\r\n\r\n(Fulham Road; said to be by Morland.)\r\n\r\nA LATTICE.\r\n\r\n(Roxburghe Ballads, circa 1650.)\r\n\r\nTHREE PIGEONS.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s collection.)\r\n\r\nUNICORN.\r\n\r\n(A Bookseller’s at Cologne, 1630.)]\r\n\r\nYork figures more frequently on the signboard than any other place in\r\nEngland. From the trades tokens we see that the CITY OF YORK was a sign\r\nin Middle Row, Holborn, in the seventeenth century. The YORK MINSTER is\r\none of the few cathedrals ever seen represented out of its own city,\r\nprobably for no other reason than because it stands in the capital of\r\nthe county from whence the Yorkshire stingo comes. York, however, seems\r\nto have been a right merry city, second only to the city of London, for\r\none of the oldest Roxburghe ballads, dated 1584, says:--\r\n\r\n  “Yorke, Yorke, for my monie, of all the cities that ever I see,\r\n  For mery pastime and companie, except the cittie of London.”\r\n\r\nThe CASTLE being such a general sign, many traders adopted some\r\nparticular castle. DOVER CASTLE, or WALMER CASTLE, is amongst the most\r\nfrequent. The first is mentioned in the following amusing\r\nadvertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “FOR FEMALE SATISFACTION.\r\n\r\n  “WHEREAS THE MYSTERY of Freemasonry has been kept a profound secret\r\n  for several Ages, till at length some Men assembled themselves at the\r\n  _Dover Castle_, in the parish of Lambeth, under pretence of knowing\r\n  the secret, and likewise in opposition to some gentlemen that are real\r\n  Freemasons, and hold a Lodge at the same house; therefore, to prove\r\n  that they are no more than pretenders, and as the Ladies have\r\n  sometimes been desirous of gaining knowledge of the noble _art_,\r\n  (sic,) several regular-made Masons, (both ancient and modern,) members\r\n  of constituted Lodges in this metropolis, have thought proper to unite\r\n  into a select Body at Beau Silvester’s, the sign of the _Angel_, Bull\r\n  Stairs, Southwark, and stile themselves UNIONS, think it highly\r\n  expedient, and in justice to the fair sex, to initiate them therein,\r\n  provided they are women of undeniable character; for tho’ no Lodge as\r\n  yet (except the Free Union Masons) have thought proper to admit Women\r\n  into the Fraternity, we, well knowing they have as much Right to\r\n  attain to the secrets as those Castle Humbugs, have thought proper so\r\n  to do, not doubting but they will prove an honour to the Craft; and as\r\n  we have had the honour to inculcate several worthy Sisters therein,\r\n  those that are desirous, and think themselves capable of having the\r\n  secret conferred on them, by proper Application, will be admitted, and\r\n  the charges will not exceed the Expences of our Lodge.”--_Publick\r\n  Advertiser_, March 7, 1759.\r\n\r\nThe sign of _the Angel_ at Beau Silvester’s was certainly well chosen by\r\nthose gallant _soi-disant_ Masons; but would not the SILENT WOMAN have\r\nbeen still more appropriate? Be that as it may, Lodges for ladies there\r\nwere--witness the following advertisement, a good specimen of\r\n“Stratford-le-Bow” French:--\r\n\r\n  “C. LOGE C.\r\n\r\n  “AVERTISSEMENT AUX DAMES, etc. Pour vincre que les Francs Massons ne\r\n  sont pas telles que le public les a representées en particulier la\r\n  sexe Feminine, cet Loge juge a propos de recevoir des Femmes aussi\r\n  bien que des Hommes.\r\n\r\n  “_N.B._--Les Dames seront introduits dans la Loge avec la Ceremonie\r\n  accoutumée ou le Serment ordinaire et le reel Secret leur seront\r\n  administrées. On commencera a recevoir des Dames Jeudy 11 de Mars\r\n  1762, at Mrs Maynard’s, next door to the Lying-in Hospital, Brownlow\r\n  Street, Longacre. La Porte sera ouverte a 6 Heures du Soir. Les Dames\r\n  et Messieurs sont priées de ne pas venir après sept. Le prix est £1,\r\n  1s.”--(_Newspaper_, 1762.)\r\n\r\nHow the ladies were initiated--or, as the worthy secretary of Beau\r\nSilvester’s Lodge calls it, “inculcated,”--we are not informed; but\r\ncertainly some modification must have been made in the usual ceremony\r\nattending the initiation of novices.\r\n\r\nLLANGOLLEN CASTLE is painted on a sign in Deansgate, Manchester: under\r\nit is the following rhyme:--\r\n\r\n  “Near the above place in a vault,\r\n    There is such liquor fixed,\r\n  You’ll say that water, hops, and malt,\r\n    Were never better mixed.”\r\n\r\nMany other castles occur, such as JERSEY CASTLE, on the token of Philip\r\nCrosse in Finch Lane, in the seventeenth century; ROCHESTER CASTLE,\r\nMITFORD CASTLE, HEREFORD CASTLE, WARWICK CASTLE, EDINBURGH CASTLE, &c.\r\n\r\nTowns are often adopted for signs as a _point de ralliement_ for the\r\nnatives of such places, the birthplace of the landlord being generally\r\nthe town which has the honour of his selection. The CITY OF NORWICH was\r\nthe sign of a house in Bishopsgate Street in the seventeenth century,\r\neither for the reason just alleged, or because “_the fall of Niniveh\r\nwith Norwich built in an hour_,” was one of the penny sights at that\r\nperiod. COVENTRY CROSS was the sign of a mercer in New Bond Street at\r\nthe end of the last century, evidently chosen on account of the silk\r\nribbons manufactured in that town; and the CHILTERN HUNDRED, a\r\npublic-house at Boxley, near Maidstone, doubtless refers to the\r\nwell-known range of hills extending from Henley-on-Thames to Tring in\r\nHerts. In old times these hills were covered with forests, and infested\r\nby numerous bands of thieves. To protect the people in the\r\nneighbourhood, an officer was appointed by the Crown, called the steward\r\nof the Chiltern Hundreds, and although the duties have long ceased the\r\noffice still exists, and is made use of to afford members of the House\r\nof Commons an opportunity of resigning their seats when they desire it.\r\nBeing a Government appointment, though without either duties or salary,\r\nthe acceptance of it disqualifies a member from retaining his seat.\r\n\r\nThe WILTSHIRE SHEPHERD was a sign in St Martin’s Lane in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. The Wiltshire downs were famous for their flocks of sheep.\r\nAubrey, himself a Wiltshireman, says that the innocent lives of those\r\nshepherds “doe give us a resemblance of the golden age.” He also states\r\nthat their sight inspired Sir Philip Sidney in charming pastorals, which\r\non those very downs he sketched from nature, as some of his old\r\nrelations well remembered. “’Twas about these purlieus,” says he, “that\r\nthe muses were wont to appeare to Sir Philip Sidney, and where he wrote\r\ndown their dictates in his table-book, though on horseback.” Many of the\r\ncustoms of these shepherds Aubrey traces down from the Romans.[600] The\r\nGENTLE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN is the name given to Farmer Peek’s\r\nhouse, on the road from Cape Town to Simon’s Bay, Cape of Good Hope. On\r\nhis signboard is the following mosaic inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Multum in parvo, pro bono publico\r\n  Entertainment for man or beast all of a row.\r\n  Lekker host as much as you please;\r\n  Excellent beds without any fleas.\r\n  Nos patriam fugimus--now we are here,\r\n  Vivamus, let us live by selling beer.\r\n  On donne à boire et à manger ici;\r\n  Come in and try it, whoever you be.\r\n    The Gentle Shepherd of Salisbury Plain.”\r\n\r\nNear Basingstoke there is a public-house sign representing a grenadier\r\nin full uniform, holding in his hand a foaming pot of ale; it is called\r\nthe WHITLEY GRENADIER, and bears the following disinterested verses:--\r\n\r\n  “This is the Whitley Grenadier,\r\n  A noted house for famous beer.\r\n  My friend, if you should chance to call,\r\n  Beware and get not drunk withal;\r\n  Let moderation be your guide,\r\n  It answers well whene’er ’tis try’d.\r\n  Then use, but not abuse, _strong beer_,\r\n  And don’t forget the Grenadier.”\r\n\r\nThis sign seems to have been suggested by the tragical death of a\r\ngrenadier, which is thus recorded on a tombstone in the churchyard of\r\nWinchester Cathedral:--\r\n\r\n  “Here sleeps in peace a Hampshire Grenadeer,\r\n  Who caught his death by drinking cold _small beer_.\r\n  Soldiers be warned by his untimely fall,\r\n  And when you’re hot, drink _strong_, or none at all.”\r\n\r\nTo which a wag appended the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “An honest soldier never is forgot,\r\n  Whether he die by musket or by pot.”\r\n\r\nThe FLITCH OF DUNMOW is a common sign in Essex, and is sometimes seen in\r\nother counties. The custom of giving a flitch of bacon, on the\r\nwell-known conditions, is not peculiar to Dunmow. In the reign of Edward\r\nIII., the Earl of Lancaster, lord of the honour of Tutbury, granted a\r\nmanor near Wichnor village, Burton-upon-Trent, to Sir Philip de\r\nSommerville, stipulating that he was to give a flitch of bacon on the\r\nsame conditions as at Dunmow.[601] At the abbey of St Milaine, near\r\nRennes, in Normandy, the same custom was observed, but the practice was\r\nstill less successful, for Dunmow at least has six times given the side\r\nof bacon away, but--\r\n\r\n  “A l’abbaye de Saint Milaine près Rennes y a plus de six cents ans ont\r\n  un costé de lard encore tout frais et non corrompu; et néanmoins ont\r\n  voué et ordonné aux premiers qui par an et jour ensemble mariez ont\r\n  vescu sans debat, grondement et sans s’en repentir.”[602]\r\n\r\nOur next sign is geographical only in its relationship. At Wansford\r\nBridge, which crosses the river Nen in Northampton, there is the HAYCOCK\r\nInn, deriving its name from a curious incident: the river overflowed its\r\nbanks and carried away a haycock with a man upon it. Taylor, the Water\r\npoet, says of the circumstance:--\r\n\r\n  “On a haycock sleeping soundly,\r\n  The river rose, and took me roundly\r\n  Down the current; people cried,\r\n  As along the stream I hied.\r\n  ‘Where away?’ quoth they, ‘From Greenland?’\r\n  ‘No; from Wansford Bridge, in England.’”\r\n\r\nThe stone bridge, of thirteen arches, carries the Great North Road\r\nacross the river, so much traversed in the coaching times; and well\r\nknown to many a traveller in those days was the Haycock Inn, at one end\r\nof the bridge, which has on the signboard a pictorial representation of\r\nthe scene.\r\n\r\nScotland, which, besides Edinburgh ales and Highland whisky, produces a\r\ngreat many publicans, is honoured in numberless signs. LAND O’ CAKES,\r\nthe name given by Burns to the country of the “brighter Scotch,” is a\r\nsign at Middle Hill Gate, near Stockport. And here we may observe the\r\npopularity of Burns among the publicans, for not only is the poet\r\nhimself, and several of his amusing heroes, exalted in innumerable\r\nplaces among the “living dead,” but at Kirby Moor some of his verses are\r\neven introduced on the sign:--\r\n\r\n  “When neebors anger at a plea,\r\n  An’ just as wud as wud can be,\r\n  How easy can the barley bree\r\n        Cement the quarrel?\r\n  It’s aye the cheapest lawyer’s fee,\r\n        To taste the barrel.”\r\n\r\nVery good advice indeed.\r\n\r\nSince the Highlander’s love for snuff and whisky was such, that he\r\nwished to have “a Benlomond of snuff, and a Loch Lomond of whisky,”\r\nnobody could make a better public-house sign than the HIGHLAND LADDIE,\r\nnor a better snuff-shop sign than the kilted Highlander who stands\r\ngenerally at the door of these establishments. Two others of the lares\r\nand penates of the tobacconist are the Sailor and the Moor or Oriental.\r\nThe first presiding over the snuff, the second over the chewing, the\r\nthird over the smoking “department,”--as the drapers term the divisions\r\nof their shop. After the rebellion of 1745, when everything was done by\r\nthe Government to extinguish the nationality of the Scotch, when Scotch\r\nballads were forbidden, and the names of some clans were deemed more\r\nodious than the word _raka_ to the Jews, the kilt was forbidden by the\r\nlegislature as an abomination. On that occasion the following trifle\r\nappeared in the newspapers:--\r\n\r\n  “We hear that the dapper wooden Highlanders, who guard so heroically\r\n  the doors of snuff-shops, intend to petition the Legislature, in order\r\n  that they may be excused from complying with the act of Parliament\r\n  with regard to their change of dress: alledging that they have ever\r\n  been faithful subjects to his Majesty, having constantly supplied his\r\n  Guards with a pinch out of their Mulls when they marched by them, and\r\n  so far from engaging in any Rebellion, that they have never\r\n  entertained a rebellious thought; whence they humbly hope that they\r\n  shall not be put to the Expense of buying new cloaths.”\r\n\r\nThe ubiquity of the Scotch packman produced the sign of the SCOTCHMAN’S\r\nPACK, St Michael’s Hill, Bristol, and in some other places. From the\r\nfollowing passage it appears that these Scottish packmen, in the\r\nsixteenth century, penetrated even as far as Poland:--“Ane pedder is\r\ncalled are merchõd or cremar quha beirs are pack or creame[603] upon his\r\nbak, quha are called beirares of the puddill be the Scottesmen in the\r\nrealme of Polonia, quhair I saw an greate multitude in the town of\r\nCracovia, anno Dom. 1569.”[604]\r\n\r\nGRETNA GREEN used at one time to be a not very uncommon sign on the\r\nBorder; there is one at Ayeliffe, Darlington. The origin of marriages at\r\nthis place is not so generally known that it would be superfluous to\r\nintroduce it here. Marriages in Scotland at all times having been\r\nconsidered legal if two parties accepted each other for man and wife in\r\nthe presence of witnesses, a dissipated tobacconist, named Joseph\r\nPaisley, about a century ago, conceived the idea of opening an\r\nestablishment on the Border to unite runaway couples in wedlock. For\r\nthis purpose he selected the common, or green, between Graitney and\r\nSpringfield, in Dumfries-shire, a place called Megshill, the first\r\nScottish ground on entering the country from Cumberland; there he\r\ncommenced business. In 1791 he settled in the then newly-built village\r\nof Springfield, but the reputation of his impromptu marriage-temple on\r\nGraitney Common, (or Gretna Green, as the English called it,) had\r\nalready so widely spread that the name of the place had passed into a\r\nby-word for clandestine marriages. Paisley died in 1814, but\r\nmarriage-mongering had become a trade in Springfield, and several\r\nself-appointed parsons started up to fill the office. Pennant says that\r\nin 1771 a young couple might be united “from two guineas a job to a dram\r\nof whisky” by a fisherman, a joiner, or a blacksmith; but the prices\r\nrose much higher afterwards, varying from £40 to half-a-guinea, and this\r\nlast sum was only accepted from pedestrian couples. As a rule, the fee\r\nwas settled by the post-boys from Carlisle, each patronising certain\r\nhouses, and the hymeneal priests, knowing the value of their patronage,\r\npermitted them to go snacks in the proceeds. It is estimated that about\r\n300 couples a year used to get married in this off-hand manner.\r\n\r\nOf our colonies, GIBRALTAR and the CAPE OF GOOD HOPE seem to be almost\r\nthe only ones considered worthy the honour of the signboard. Gibraltar\r\nbecame popular as soon as the acquisition had been esteemed at its\r\nproper value. As for the Cape of Good Hope, the frequency of this sign\r\nall over England seems to render it probable that it was not so much\r\nadopted in honour of the colony as to express the landlord’s _hope_ of\r\nsuccess, and therefore as a sort of equivalent to the Hope and Anchor,\r\nor the Hope.[605] The JAMAICA tavern, too, may have been christened in\r\ncompliment to the birth-place of rum. There is a house with this name in\r\nBermondsey, which is one of the many houses stated in our time to have\r\nbeen a residence of Oliver Cromwell. “The building, of which only a\r\nmoiety now remains, and that very ruinous, the other having been removed\r\nyears ago to make room for modern erections, presents probably almost\r\nthe same features as when tenanted by the Protector. The carved\r\nquatrefoils and flowers upon the staircase beams, the old-fashioned\r\nfastenings of the doors--‘bolts, locks, and bars’--the huge single\r\ngable, (which in a modern house would be double,) even the divided\r\nsection, like a monstrous amputated stump, imperfectly plastered over,\r\npatched here and there with planks, slates, and tiles, to keep the wind\r\nand weather out, though it be very poorly--all are in keeping; and the\r\nglimmer of the gas, by which the old and ruinous kitchen into which we\r\nstrayed was dimly lighted, seemed to ‘pale its ineffectual fires’ in\r\nstriving to illumine the old black settles, and still older\r\nwainscot.”[606] After the Restoration, this house seems to have become a\r\ntavern, and here, according to the homely, kind-hearted custom of the\r\ntimes, Pepys, on Sunday, April 14, 1667, took his wife and her maids to\r\ngive them a day’s pleasure. “Over the water to the Jamaica house, where\r\nI never was before, and then the girls did run wagers on the bowling\r\ngreen, and there with much pleasure spent little, and so home.”\r\nSubsequently, he frequently returned to this place, which seems to have\r\nbeen the same he elsewhere calls The Halfway House. Besides this, there\r\nis the JAMAICA AND MADEIRA coffee-house, a well-known business club or\r\ntavern in St Michael’s Alley, Cornhill.\r\n\r\nOnly a few European nations and towns are represented. Amongst the\r\nBagford shopbills there is one of a perfumer, named Dighton, who, in the\r\nreign of Queen Anne, sold “true Hungary Water, _all sorts of snuff_ and\r\nperfumes,” &c. His shop was next door to the King’s Head Tavern at\r\nChancery Lane End, and had the sign of the CITY OF SEVILLA; the woodcut\r\nabove his shop-bill presents a distant family resemblance to that place,\r\nand with a little goodwill one may recognise the Alcazar, the Giralda,\r\nSan Clementi, and San Juan de la Palma; the view is taken from the\r\nsuburb of Triana, on the other side of the river. This “famous Henry\r\nDighton,” as he styles himself in an advertisement in 1718, “sworn\r\nperfumer in ordinary to H. M. King George,” had chosen the sign of the\r\nCity of Sevilla from the fact of his importing Spanish snuff, the\r\nfashionable mixture in those days, which the gallants dislodged with\r\nsuch airy elegance from among the lace frills of their shirts and\r\nneckties. His successor, Henry Coulthurst, promised “to furnish greater\r\nvariety of the choicest and truest snuff than any perfumer in England,\r\nviz., Havana, Port St Mary’s, Barcelona, Port Mahon, Seville, plain\r\nSpanish, and fine Lisbon.” These Spanish snuffs had come greatly into\r\nfashion at the capture of Puerta St Maria, near Cadiz, when the fleet,\r\nunder Sir George Rooke, captured several thousand barrels of snuff. But\r\nlong before that time enormous quantities of Spanish tobacco had been\r\nyearly imported into England.\r\n\r\n  “There was wont to come out of Spain,” said Sir Edwin Sandys, in 1620,\r\n  “a great mass of money to the value of £100,000 per annum for our\r\n  cloths and other merchandises; and now we have from thence for all our\r\n  cloth and merchandises nothing but tobacco: nay, that will not pay for\r\n  all the tobacco we have from thence, but they have more from us in\r\n  money every year, £20,000; so there goes out of this kingdom as good\r\n  as £120,000 for tobacco every year.”[607]\r\n\r\nThe THREE SPANISH GYPSIES, in the New Exchange, was the shop of the\r\nfuture “Monkey Duchess,” the nickname given by her aristocratic friends\r\nto Anne Monk, Duchess of Albemarle. “She was the daughter of John\r\nClarges, a farrier in the Savoy, and horse-shoer to Colonel Monk. In\r\n1632 she was married, in the church of St Lawrence Poultney, to Thomas\r\nRadford, son of Thomas Radford, late a farrier, servant to Prince\r\nCharles, and resident in the Mews. She had a daughter who was born in\r\n1634, and died in 1638. She lived with her husband at the Three Spanish\r\nGypsies, in the New Exchange, and sold wash-balls, powder, gloves, and\r\nsuch things, and taught girls plain work. About 1647, being a sempstress\r\nto Colonel Monk, she used to carry him his linen. In 1648 her father and\r\nmother died. The year after she fell out with her husband, and they\r\nparted. But no certificate from any parish register appears reciting his\r\nburial. In 1652 she was married in the church of St George, Southwark,\r\nto General Monk, and in the following year was delivered of a son,\r\nChristopher, (afterwards the second and last Duke of Albemarle,) who was\r\nsuckled by Honour Mills, who sold apples, herbs, and oysters.”[608] What\r\nbecame of her first husband, and when he died, is not known.\r\n\r\nVENICE was the sign of B. Martin, a bookseller in the Old Bailey,\r\n_circa_ 1640, adopted probably in honour of the Aldi, the famous\r\nprinters, who carried on business in this city. In the reign of Charles\r\nII. there was a house of indifferent fame in Moorfields, called the\r\nRUSSIA HOUSE, whether opened during the time that the Russian\r\nambassadors visited the king, or how it obtained its name, is not known.\r\nThe house became notorious in 1667 through the trial of Gabriel Holmes\r\nand a band of incendiaries, among whom were two young boys, sons of\r\nJames Montague of Lackham, grandsons of the Earl of Manchester. The boys\r\nturned king’s evidence, and Holmes was hanged. Russia House was one of\r\nthe places where they planned their expeditions and spent their money:\r\nthe object of their incendiarism, it came out at the trial, was simply\r\nthat they might steal the goods which would be flung into the streets by\r\nthe terrified inmates of the burning houses.\r\n\r\nThe ANTWERP tavern was a famous house behind the Exchange, in the\r\nseventeenth century, of which tokens are extant, representing a view of\r\nAntwerp from the river. The extensive trade of Flanders, in the middle\r\nages and long after, made Antwerp a favourite subject for signboards, it\r\nbeing the best harbour in Flanders. In Dieppe there is still a house on\r\nthe Quai Henri IV., bearing a stone bas-relief sign of Antwerp, (_la\r\nville d’Anvers_,) with the date 1697; but this house and sign are named,\r\nas early as 1645, in a MS. list of rents of houses in Dieppe, due to the\r\nArchbishop of Rouen.\r\n\r\nDutchmen, in some instances, have been appointed the tutelar saints of\r\npublic-houses, on account of their reputed love for drink; thus we have\r\nthe TWO DUTCHMEN at Marsden, near Huddersfield, and the JOVIAL DUTCHMAN\r\nat Crick, in Derbyshire. Now, though the Dutchman’s joviality is\r\nquestionable, yet he certainly has at all times been reputed a heavy\r\ndrinker. Shakespeare names, “your swag-bellied Hollander,” along with\r\nthe Dane and German, as the only (though unsuccessful) rival of the\r\nEnglish in the art of hard drinking. Massinger, in his “Duke of\r\nFlorence,” has a similar remark; and Sir Richard Baker, in his\r\n“Chronicles,” says that the English “in these Dutch wars learned to be\r\ndrunkards, and as we do not like to do things by halves in this country,\r\nwe soon surpassed our masters.” Decker remarks that “Drunkenness, which\r\nwas once the Dutchman’s headake, is now become the Englishman’s.”[609]\r\n_Upsy Dutch_ and _upsy freeze_ (for “_op zyn Dutch_,” and “_op zyn\r\nVriesch_,” à la Dutch and à la Vriesch) are terms constantly used by\r\nDecker to denote a _very_ drunken condition. Yet there was a time, long\r\nbefore the “Dutch wars,” when the English did not want any foreign\r\nmasters to teach them drinking; how could it have been otherwise with\r\ndescendants of the beer-drinking Saxons and Danes? Malmesbury complains\r\nthat in his time “the English fashion was to sit bibbing whole hours\r\nafter dinner, as the Normane guise was to walke and get up and downe in\r\nthe stretes with great waines of idle serving men following them;”[610]\r\nand Hollinshed, who wrote at the very time of the Dutch wars, mentions\r\namong the improvements which old men in his time observed, was that the\r\nfarmers could pay their rent without selling a cow or a horse, as they\r\nhad been wont to do in former times, “owing to _too much attention to\r\nthe ale-house_, and too little to work.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, the Jovial Dutchman is a very good sign for\r\nlicensed victuallers, since the general opinion is:--\r\n\r\n  “Death’s not to be--, so Seneca doth think,\r\n  But Dutchmen say ’tis death to cease to drink.”[611]\r\n\r\nBesides drinking, the Dutchman has long had a reputation for smoking,\r\nwhence the tobacconists of the last century used frequently to have on\r\ntheir sign, a Scotchman, a Dutchman, and a sailor, with the following\r\nrhyme:--\r\n\r\n  “We three are engaged in one cause,\r\n  I snuffs, I smokes, and I chaws.”\r\n\r\nA tobacconist in Kingsland Road had the same men, but a different\r\nreading of the text:--\r\n\r\n  “This Indian weed is good indeed,\r\n  Puff on, keep up the joke,\r\n  ’Tis the best, ’twill stand the test,\r\n  Either to chew or smoke.”[612]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of coffee produced signs of various sultans, but the\r\nTURK’S HEAD may, perhaps, date from earlier times, possessing an origin\r\nsimilar to the Saracen’s Head. The Turks throughout the fifteenth,\r\nsixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, were a common topic of\r\nconversation, and the bugbear of the European nations. This is well\r\nexemplified in the church-wardens’ accounts of St Helen’s, Abingdon,\r\nwhere the following entry occurs:--“Anno MDLXV--8 of Q. Eliz.--payde for\r\ntwo bokes of common prayer agaynste invading of the Turke, 0. 6.” That\r\nyear the Turks had made a descent upon the isle of Malta, where they\r\nbesieged the town and castle of St Michael; but upon the approach of the\r\nfleet of the Order, they broke up the siege and suffered a considerable\r\nloss in their flight. During the war of Emperor Maximilian against the\r\nTurks in Hungary, similar prayer-books were annually purchased for the\r\nparish. The first prototypes of newspapers, also, were the printed\r\ndespatches concerning the battles and engagements of the emperor with\r\nthe Turks,[613] and even at the end of the seventeenth century no\r\nnewspaper was complete without its news from the Danube and “movements\r\nof the Turks.” One of the earliest patents granted for pistols, contains\r\na clause that square balls are not to be used, “except against the\r\nTurks.” The number of Turk’s Heads in London in the seventeenth century\r\nwas considerable; not less than eight trades tokens of different houses\r\nwith this sign are known to exist.\r\n\r\nIn 1667, Robert Boulter, at the Turk’s Head in Bishopsgate, published\r\nthe first edition of Milton’s “Paradise Lost.” It was with difficulty\r\nthat the author sold the copy for _five pounds_! he was to receive £5\r\nmore after the sale of the 1300 copies which comprised the first\r\nimpression, and £5 more after the sale of each new impression of 1300\r\ncopies each. “And what a poor consideration was this,” says one of his\r\nbiographers, “for such an inestimable performance,” and how much more do\r\nothers get by the works of great authors than the authors themselves!\r\nAnd yet we find that Hoyle, the author of the “Treatise on the Game of\r\nWhist,” after having disposed of the whole of the first impression, sold\r\nthe copyright to the bookseller for two hundred guineas.\r\n\r\nDr Johnson used often to take supper at the Turk’s Head in the Strand:\r\n“I encourage this house, (said he;) for the mistress of it is a good,\r\ncivil woman, and has not much business.”[614] At another Turk’s Head,\r\nGerrard Street, Soho, Johnson formed, in 1763, that well-known club,\r\nwhich was long without a name, but which after Garrick’s funeral became\r\ndistinguished by the name of the _Literary Club_.\r\n\r\n  “Sir Joshua Reynolds had the merit of being the first proposer of it,\r\n  to which Johnson acceded, and the original members were Sir Joshua\r\n  Reynolds, Dr Johnson, Mr Edmund Burke, Dr Nugent, Mr Beauclerck, Mr\r\n  Langton, Dr Goldsmith, Mr Chamier, and Sir John Hawkins. They met at\r\n  the Turk’s Head in Gerrard Street, Soho, one evening every week, at\r\n  seven, and generally continued their conversation till a pretty late\r\n  hour. This club has been gradually increased to its present [1791]\r\n  number thirty-five. After about ten years, instead of supping weekly,\r\n  it was resolved to dine together once a fortnight during the meeting\r\n  of Parliament.”[615]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the landlord of this house, the club removed to the\r\nPRINCE in Sackville Street; and after two or three more changes, it\r\nfinally settled down at the THATCHED HOUSE, St James’s. The original\r\nportrait of Sir Joshua Reynolds, presented to the club by the painter\r\nhimself, is still preserved; one of its peculiarities is, that the\r\nartist has represented himself wearing spectacles. The club is still in\r\nexistence, under the name of the Dilettanti Club. “The Turk’s Head in\r\nGerrard Street, Soho,” says Moser in his Memorandum-book, “was, more\r\nthan fifty years since, removed from a tavern of the same sign, the\r\ncorner of Greek and Compton Streets. This place was a kind of\r\nhead-quarters for the Loyal Association during the rebellion of\r\n1745.”[616]\r\n\r\nAbout that time there was a waiter in this tavern, who, like Tennyson’s\r\nwaiter at the Cock, Templebar, had obtained considerable celebrity. His\r\nname was _Little Will_. On an engraving dated 1752, he is represented as\r\na small man with a large head and a periwig, dressed in a long apron,\r\nwith a pair of snuffers suspended from the waist. The Rev. Mr\r\nHuddersford, of Trinity College, Oxford, in a letter to Granger, says,--\r\n\r\n  “Little Will, as I have heard, was a great favourite with the\r\n  gentlemen of the coffee-house; there is a print representing him in\r\n  his constant attitude, apparently insensible to anything around him,\r\n  but swallowing every article of politicks that dropped, which, I am\r\n  told, he understands better than any of his masters.”\r\n\r\nThe THREE TURKS was a sign at Norwich in 1750,[617] and even now, though\r\nthe crescent is decidedly in the “last quarter,” there are still signs\r\nof Turks to be found, as the TURK AND SLAVE, Brick Lane, Spitalfields;\r\nthe GREAT TURK (_i.e._, the Sultan) at Wolverhampton--the last is of\r\nconsiderable antiquity, for in 1600 it was the sign of John Barnes, a\r\nbookseller in Fleet Street. One of the most opulent Turkish towns was\r\ncommemorated by the SMYRNA coffee-house, in Pall Mall, a fashionable\r\ncoffee-house in the reign of Queen Anne, when the wits and beaux used to\r\ntake their constitutional in St James’ Park, and then go to the Smyrna,\r\nwhere, sitting before the open windows, they could see the ladies\r\ncarried past in their sedans or coaches, on their return from the Mall.\r\nThis coffee-house seems to have had a reputation for politics. In the\r\n_Tatler_, (No. 10,) a “cluster of wise heads” is said to sit every\r\nevening from the left side of the fire at the Smyrna to the door; and in\r\nNo. 78, the public is informed that “the seat of learning is now removed\r\nfrom the corner of the chimney on the left hand towards the window, to\r\nthe round table in the middle of the floor, over against the fire; a\r\nrevolution much lamented by the porters and chairmen, who were greatly\r\nedified through a pane of glass that remained broken all the last\r\nsummer.” Prior, Swift, and Pope, were constant visitors at this house.\r\n\r\nThere was a GRECIAN coffee-house in Devereux Court, Strand, which for\r\nnearly two centuries was equally well frequented. It derived its name\r\nprobably from having been opened by a Greek, the natives of that country\r\nhaving been among the first to open coffee-houses in London. It was a\r\nvery fashionable house in the time of the _Spectators_ and _Tatlers_:\r\n“My face is likewise very well known at the Grecian,” says Addison in\r\n_Spectator_, No. 1. It seems generally to have been frequented by\r\nliterati and savants, some of them rather hot-headed:--\r\n\r\n  “I remember two gentlemen, who were constant companions, disputing one\r\n  evening at the Grecian coffee-house, concerning the accent of a Greek\r\n  word. This dispute was carried to such a length that the two friends\r\n  thought proper to determine it with their swords; for this purpose\r\n  they stept into Devereux Court, where one of them (whose name, if I\r\n  remember right, was Fitzgerald) was run through the body, and died on\r\n  the spot.”[618]\r\n\r\nIn this coffee-house Mrs Mapp, the famous bone-setter, (see p. 113)\r\nperformed her cures before Sir Hans Sloane:--\r\n\r\n  “On Saturday and yesterday, Mrs Mapp performed several operations at\r\n  the Grecian coffee-house, particularly one upon a niece of Sir Hans\r\n  Sloane, to his great satisfaction and her credit. The patient had her\r\n  shoulder-bone out for about nine years.”--_Grub Street Journal_,\r\n  October 21, 1736.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-house was closed in 1843; a bust of Essex is in front of the\r\nhouse it formerly occupied with the inscription, “This is Devereux\r\nCourt, 1676.”\r\n\r\nVarious reasons are given to account for the sign of the SARACEN’S HEAD.\r\n“When our countrymen came home from fighting with the Saracens, and were\r\nbeaten by them, they pictured them with huge, big, terrible faces, (as\r\nyou still see the sign of the Saracen’s Head is,) when, in truth, they\r\nwere like other men. But this they did to save their own credit.”[619]\r\nOr the sign may have been adopted by those who had visited the Holy\r\nLand, either as pilgrims or when fighting the Saracens. Others, again,\r\nhold that it was first set up in compliment to the mother of Thomas à\r\nBecket, who was the daughter of a Saracen: formerly the sign was very\r\ngeneral. During the time of the Commonwealth, the Saracen’s Head in\r\nIslington was a place of resort for the Londoners. In the “Walks of\r\nIslington and Hogsden, with the Humours of Wood Street Compter,” a\r\ncomedy by Thomas Jordan, gentleman, 1648, the scene is laid at that\r\ntavern. It was also the sign of the house occupied by Sir Christopher\r\nWren in Friday Street, which remained almost unchanged till it was taken\r\ndown in 1844. The Saracen’s Head, Snow Hill, is one of the last\r\nremaining, and, at the same time, one of the oldest, being named in Dick\r\nTarlton’s Jests as “the Sarracen’s Head without Newgate;” and Stow says,\r\n“next to this church [St Sepulchre’s in the Bailey] is a fair and large\r\ninn for receipt of travellers, and hath to sign the Sarrazen’s Head.”\r\nThe courtyard has still many of the characteristics of an old English\r\ninn, with galleries all round leading to the bed-rooms, and a spacious\r\ngate, through which the dusty mail-coaches used to rumble in, the tired\r\npassengers creeping forth, and thanking their stars in having escaped\r\nthe highwaymen, and the holes and sloughs of the road. How many hearts,\r\nbeating with hope on their first entry into London, have passed under\r\nthis gate, that now lie mouldering in the quiet little churchyards of\r\nthe metropolis: some finding a resting-place in Westminster, whilst\r\nothers ceased to beat at Tyburn. It was at this inn that Nicholas\r\nNickleby and his uncle waited upon Squeers, the Yorkshire schoolmaster.\r\nMr Dickens describes the old tavern as it was in the last years of our\r\nmail-coaching, when it was one of the most important places for\r\narrivals and departures in London:--\r\n\r\n  “Near to the jail, and by consequence near to Smithfield also, and the\r\n  Compter and the bustle and noise of the city; and just on that\r\n  particular part of Snow Hill where omnibus horses going eastwards\r\n  seriously think of falling down on purpose, and where horses in\r\n  hackney cabriolets going westwards not unfrequently fall by accident,\r\n  is the coach-yard of the Saracen’s Head Inn, its portals guarded by\r\n  two Saracens’ heads and shoulders, which it was once the pride and\r\n  glory of the choice spirits of this metropolis to pull down at night,\r\n  but which have for some time remained in undisturbed tranquillity,\r\n  possibly because this species of humour is now confined to Saint\r\n  James’s parish, where door-knockers are preferred as being more\r\n  portable, and bell-wires esteemed as convenient toothpicks. Whether\r\n  this be the reason or not, there they are, frowning upon you from each\r\n  side of the gateway; and the inn itself, garnished with another\r\n  Saracen’s Head, frowns upon you from the top of the yard; while from\r\n  the door of the hind boot of all the red coaches that are standing\r\n  therein, there glares a small Saracen’s Head with a twin expression to\r\n  the large Saracen’s Head below, so that the general appearance of the\r\n  pile is of the Saracenic order.”\r\n\r\nBlackamoors and other dark-skinned foreigners have always possessed\r\nconsiderable attractions as signs for tobacconists, and sometimes also\r\nfor public-houses. Negroes, with feathered headdresses and kilts,\r\nsmoking pipes, are to be seen outside tobacco-shops on the Continent, as\r\nwell as in England. Thus, in the seventeenth century, there was one in\r\nAmsterdam with the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Josua badt den Heere van herten aan\r\n  Dat de zon en maan bleef stille staan.\r\n  Puik van Verinis en gœ Blaan\r\n  Haalt men hier in den Indiaan.”[620]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the VIRGINIAN was the most\r\ncommon in England, owing to the first tobacco having been imported from\r\nthat country:--\r\n\r\n  “They returned homewards, passing by Virginia, a colony which Sir\r\n  Walter Raleigh had there planted, from whence Drake brings home with\r\n  him Walter Lane, who was the first that brought tobacco into England,\r\n  which the Indians take against crudities of the stomach.”[621]\r\n\r\nPublicans have a strange fancy for INDIAN KINGS, QUEENS, and CHIEFS,\r\nthus bearing out Trinculo’s assertion of the nation at large:--“When\r\nthey will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out\r\nten to see _a dead Indian_.” There is a sculptured sign of an INDIAN\r\nCHIEF at Shoreditch, having all the appearance of an old ship’s\r\nfigure-head; and, as a _nomen ac præterea nihil_, it figures in many\r\nplaces. In Dolphin Lane, Boston, (Linc.,) there used formerly to be a\r\nsign with some fanciful, masked-ball dressed figures on it, which were\r\nmeant to represent the THREE KINGS of Cologne; but they conveyed so\r\nlittle the idea of those holy personages, that the _profanum vulgus_\r\ncalled them the THREE MERRY DEVILS. Eventually, by a metamorphosis more\r\nstrange than any in Ovid, these three merry devils were transformed into\r\none very strangely dressed female called the INDIAN QUEEN. The AFRICAN\r\nCHIEF, in Sommerstown, is evidently a variety of these Indian chiefs.\r\n\r\nAnother sign of venerable antiquity is the BLACK BOY. That this is of\r\nold standing, appears from an entry in Machyn’s Diary: “The XXX day of\r\nDesember 1562, was slayne in John Street, Gylbard Goldsmith, dwellyng at\r\nthe sene of the _Blake Boy_, in the Cheap, by ys wyff’s sun.”\r\n\r\nThis Black Boy seems to have been a tobacconist’s sign from the first;\r\nfor in Ben Jonson’s “Bartholomew Fair” we find:--“I thought he would\r\nhave run mad o’ the Black Boy in Bucklersbury, that takes the scurvy\r\nroguy tobacco there.”--_Act_ i., _Scene_ 1.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, it was the sign of a celebrated ordinary in\r\nSouthwark:--\r\n\r\n  “Jove, and all his hous’hold a’ter\r\n  Him, yesterday went crosse the water,\r\n  To th’ signe of the Black Boy in Southwarke,\r\n  To th’ ordinary, to find his mouth worke.\r\n  Here he intends to fuddle’s nose\r\n  This fortnight yet, under the rose.”\r\n\r\n  _Homer à la Mode_, 1665.\r\n\r\nAt the Black Boy in Newgate Street, the Calves’ Head Club was sometimes\r\nheld. It was not restricted to any particular house, but moved yearly\r\nfrom one place to another, as it was found most convenient. An axe was\r\nhung up in the club-room crowned with laurel: the bill of fare consisted\r\nof calves’ heads, dressed in various ways; a large pike, with a small\r\none in his mouth, (an emblem of tyranny;) a large cod’s head; and a\r\nboar’s head, to indicate stupidity and bestiality.[622]\r\n\r\nOne of the early editions of Cocker’s Arithmetic was published at the\r\nBlack Boy. Such was the fame of this work, that even as the Pythagorians\r\nswore _in verba magistris_, and αυτος ἑφη settled all questions, so our\r\nancestors proved their points “according to Cocker.” The title of the\r\nwork we must not abbreviate:--\r\n\r\n  “COCKER’S ARITHMETIC: Being a plain and familiar method, suitable to\r\n  the meanest capacity, for the full understanding of that incomparable\r\n  art, as now taught by the ablest schoolmasters in city and country.\r\n  Composed by Thomas Cocker, late practioner in the art of writing,\r\n  arithmetic, and engraving. Being that so long since promised to the\r\n  world. Perused and published by John Hawkins, writing-master, near St\r\n  George’s Church, in Southwark. By the author’s correct copy, and\r\n  commended to the world by many eminent Mathematicians and\r\n  writing-masters in and near London. Licensed September 1677. London:\r\n  printed by J. R. for T. P., and are to be sold by John Back, at the\r\n  Black Boy, on London Bridge. 1694. 12o.”\r\n\r\nThe BLACK GIRL is a variety of this sign at Clareborough, Notts. So,\r\ntoo, appears to be the ARAB BOY, an ale-house on the road between Putney\r\nand East-Sheen. The TWO BLACK BOYS occurs on one of the London trades\r\ntokens, where they are represented shaking hands. The BLACK BOY AND COMB\r\nwas, in 1730, a shop on Ludgate Hill, either a perfumer’s or a mercer’s,\r\nfor he advertises “right French Hungary water, at 1s. 3d. a half pint\r\nbottle; fine Florence oil, at 2s. per flask; right orange flower water,\r\nat 1s. 6d. per flask; Barbadoes citron water, at 14s. per quart; and all\r\nsort of Bermudas, Leghorn, and fine silk hats for ladies,” &c.[623] The\r\ncombination on the sign arose from the combs dangling at the doors of\r\nthe shops where they were sold.\r\n\r\nThe BLACK BOY AND CAMEL (doubtless a black boy leading a camel) was not\r\nmany years ago the sign of a tavern in Leadenhall Street, where it was\r\nalready in existence in the year 1700.\r\n\r\n  “The Annual feast for the Parish of St Dunstan, in Stepney, being\r\n  revived, will be kept the 29th instant, at the King’s Head, in\r\n  Stepney, where Tickets may be had, and at Tho. Warham’s, at the _Black\r\n  Boy and Camel_, Leaden Hall Street,” &c.--_London Gazette_, August\r\n  15-19, 1700.\r\n\r\nThese parish feasts show most unmistakably the general conviviality of\r\nthe time. Natives of the same county used also to have their public\r\nfeasts. Thus the _London Gazette_ for May 30 to June 3, 1700, advertises\r\n“the annual feast for gentlemen of the county of Huntingdon;” and the\r\n_Gazette_ for October 21-24, “the anniversary feast for the gentlemen,\r\nnatives of the county of Kent.” It is easy to imagine the attraction of\r\nsuch festivals in times when travelling was both very expensive and very\r\ndangerous,--when the post was badly conducted and extravagant in its\r\ncharges; and, moreover, but few people could write. Such meetings, then,\r\nwere the only ties that connected the provincial residing in London\r\nwith the home of his childhood. At such times friends brought up in the\r\nsame town or village could meet each other, talk over bygone times, call\r\nup the recollections of early years, remember mutual friends, and drink\r\na bumper to those left behind. Sometimes these feasts took a religious\r\nturn, when a native of the county or district preached in the\r\nneighbouring church or chapel. Blessed occasions were these religious\r\nyet merry feasts of the olden time. But the “march of intellect”--that\r\nis to say, improved locomotion, the spread of reading, writing, and high\r\nnotions--have done away with these meetings of warm hearts and jovial\r\ntempers as things low and vulgar.\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM was sure to figure early on signboards of those inns at which\r\npilgrims, on their way to the Holy Land, were wont to put up; and long\r\nafter pilgrimages were discontinued it was still retained as a sign. In\r\n1657 we find it in Fleet Street. What the sign was like it is impossible\r\nnow to say, but on the trades token of the house the Holy City is\r\nrepresented by one single building. There is another token extant of a\r\nhouse, also in Fleet Street, without date or name of the shop, on which\r\nthere is a view of a town, with the usual conventional representation of\r\nthe temple of Solomon. It was equally common in France. Regnard mentions\r\none in Nogent:--\r\n\r\n  “Entrant dans la bonne ville\r\n    Cité Nogent\r\n  Jerusalem fut l’asile\r\n    Soleil couchant,\r\n  Bon sejour pour le pelerin,\r\n  Vin du Vaulx, et le bon vin.”[624]\r\n\r\nOn a house in the Rue Etoupée, at Rouen, there is a stone carved sign of\r\nJerusalem, represented as a fortified town, with a figure arriving on\r\neach side, evidently meant for pilgrims. A similar idea seems to be\r\nconveyed by the sign of TRIP TO JERUSALEM, a public-house in Nottingham,\r\nand the PILGRIM in Coventry. There is still an Old Jerusalem tavern in\r\nClerkenwell, so called after the Knights of St John, of whose hospital\r\nthis house was the principal gateway.\r\n\r\nMOUNT PLEASANT is a name frequently bestowed upon public-houses, not\r\nalways with any allusion to such a locality, but simply on account of\r\nits being an alluring name of the same maudlin class as COTTAGE OF\r\nCONTENT, BANK OF FRIENDSHIP, &c. There is said to be a mountain of that\r\nname in America, which obtained some celebrity from being the locality\r\non which the sassafras (_Orchis mascula_) was gathered, the plant which\r\nproduces the saloop. This drink came in vogue at the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century. Reide’s coffee-house in Fleet Street was the first\r\nrespectable house where it was sold. When it was opened in 1719, the\r\nfollowing lines, painted on a board, hung in front of the house; in\r\nlatter times, until the closing of the establishment in 1833, they were\r\npreserved in the coffee-room:--\r\n\r\n  “Come all degrees now passing by,\r\n  My charming liquor taste and try;\r\n  To Lockyer[625] come and drink your fill,\r\n  Mount Pleasant has no kind of ill.\r\n  The fumes of wines, punch, drams, or beer,\r\n  It will expel; your spirits cheer;\r\n  From drowsiness your spirits free;\r\n  Sweet as a rose your breath shall be.\r\n  Come taste and try, and speak your mind,\r\n  Such rare ingredients here are joined.\r\n  Mount Pleasant pleases all mankind.”\r\n\r\nLockyer had begun life with half-a-crown, and by selling salop, or\r\nsaloop, at Fleet-ditch, amassed sufficient to open the above place in\r\nFleet Street, where he died worth £1000, in March 1739.[626]\r\n\r\nOur old friend Pepys mentions going to CHINA HALL, but gives no further\r\nparticulars. It is not unlikely that this was the same place which, in\r\nthe summer of 1777, was opened as a theatre. Whatever its use in former\r\ntimes, it was at that period the warehouse of a paper manufacturer. In\r\nthose days the West-end often visited the entertainments of the East,\r\nand the new theatre was sufficiently patronised to enable the\r\nproprietors to venture upon some embellishments. The prices were--boxes,\r\n3s.; pit, 2s.; gallery, 1s.; and the time of commencing varied from\r\nhalf-past six to seven o’clock, according to the season. “The Wonder,”\r\n“Love in a Village,” the “Comical Courtship,” and the “Lying Valet,”\r\nwere among the plays performed. The famous Cooke was one of the actors\r\nin the season of 1778. In that same year the building suffered the usual\r\nfate of all theatres, and was utterly destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nOne name we omitted to notice when speaking of signs derived from\r\nEuropean cities--COPENHAGEN HOUSE. Until very recently, this stood\r\nisolated in the fields north of the metropolis, near the old road to\r\nHighgate. It was said to have derived its name from the fact of a Danish\r\nprince or ambassador having resided in it during a great plague in\r\nLondon. Another tradition is to the effect that, early in the\r\nseventeenth century, upon some political occasion, great numbers of\r\nDanes left that kingdom, and came to London; whereupon the house was\r\nopened by an emigrant from Copenhagen, as a place of resort for his\r\ncountrymen resident in the metropolis. This tradition probably refers to\r\nthe reign of James I., who was visited in London by his brother-in-law,\r\nthe King of Denmark, at which time it is very probable that there was a\r\nconsiderable influx of persons from the Danish capital. _Coopen-Hagen_\r\nis the name given to the place in the map accompanying Camden’s\r\nBritannia, 1695. For many years previous to its demolition, the house\r\nhad a great reputation amongst Cockney excursionists, and its\r\ntea-gardens, skittle-ground, Dutch pins, and particularly Fives Play,\r\nwere great attractions. For this last game especially the place was very\r\nfamous. The house possessed another attraction. From its windows a very\r\nfine view of London, the Thames, and the Surrey hills beyond, was\r\nobtainable. The New Cattle Market now occupies its site, and a modern\r\npublic-house only perpetuates the name.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-mentioned geographical signs, we have others of more\r\nmodern introduction, such as the SOUTH AUSTRALIAN in Cadogan Street,\r\nChelsea, and the NORTH POLE in Oxford Street, which last commemorates\r\none of those equally brave and unsuccessful expeditions that have taken\r\nplace every now and then since Admiral Frobisher first started on the\r\ndiscovery of the Meta Incognita.\r\n\r\nThere exists a class of signs in some respects geographical, yet, from\r\ntheir indefinite character, they are more adapted for insertion in the\r\nfollowing chapter than here. We allude to such tavern decorations as\r\nthat picture of the fiery sun going down behind a hill, which is called\r\nTHE WORLD’S END, at St George’s, near Bristol; THE FIRST AND LAST INN IN\r\nENGLAND, a sign which may be seen in many other localities besides at\r\nthe Land’s End, in Cornwall; and NO PLACE INN, a public-house in the\r\nsuburbs of Plymouth, the sign representing an old woman standing at the\r\ndoor, accosting her husband, just arrived--“Where have you been?” “No\r\nplace.” Many others of an equally indefinite character might be given\r\nhere, but they would be found to be even less topographical than those\r\njust named.\r\n\r\n[600] Aubrey, Remains of Judaisme and Gentilisme.

This is a kind of comicality\r\nundoubtedly dating from the first development of human wit. The\r\n“Batromyomachia” is one of the oldest performances of the same\r\ndescription in literature, but the joke was already too well understood\r\nat the period that piece was produced to have been a first attempt. The\r\nFable was the higher walk of art in this branch, the simple Caricature\r\nthe lower.\r\n\r\nNumerous Egyptian, Greek, and Roman caricatures of animals personating\r\nmen have come down to us; from them this conceit was borrowed by the\r\nmediæval limners. Their MSS. teem with such subjects; and so much was\r\nthis kind of humour relished at that period, that even in church\r\ndecoration the caricatures of animals were liberally mixed up with the\r\nsacred subjects of biblical history. Not only the fable, conferring a\r\nmoral lesson, but even the plain and unpretending animal-caricature was\r\nadmitted indiscriminately with representations of saints and miracles.\r\nThus the well-known sign of PIG AND WHISTLE is seen in more than one\r\nchurch. In the stall carving of Winchester Cathedral a sow is\r\nrepresented sitting on her haunches, playing on a whistle, the companion\r\ncarving to which is a pig playing on a violin, in accompaniment to which\r\nanother pig appears to be singing. These musical pigs are also common in\r\nillustrated MSS. In Harl. MS., 4379, a sow is represented dressed in the\r\nfull fashion of the fifteenth century, with horned head-dress and\r\nstilted heels, playing on a harp.\r\n\r\nIn old towns, such as Chester, Macclesfield, Coventry, &c., the Pig and\r\nWhistle is still found on signboards. Very different and learned\r\nexplanations have been given for its origin, some saying it was a\r\ncorruption of the _pig and wassail bowl_, or of the _pix and housel_;\r\nothers that it is a facetious rendering of the Bear and Ragged Staff.\r\nVery lately the correspondents of a learned periodical have busied\r\nthemselves in claiming for it a Danish-Saxon descent, as _pige-washail_,\r\nour Ladies’ Salutation. The Scotch also claim it as their own; _pig_\r\nbeing a pot or pot-sherd; _whistle_, small change; and “to go to _pigs\r\nand whistles_,” a free translation of “going to _pot_,” which Mr\r\nJamieson states (quoting two examples) to have been at one time a\r\ncolloquial phrase. _Non nostrum est tantas componere lites_; but the\r\nproverb says, “a hog though in armour is still but a hog;” and therefore\r\nwe are inclined to think that a pig with a whistle is still but a pig,\r\nand not relating in any way to the Virgin; and we can see nothing in the\r\nPig and Whistle but simply a freak of the mediæval artist.\r\n\r\nAs little hidden meaning is there in the CAT AND FIDDLE, still a great\r\nfavourite in Hampshire, the only connexion between the animal and the\r\ninstrument being that the strings are made from the cat’s entrails, and\r\nthat a small fiddle is called a _kit_, and a small cat a _kitten_.\r\nBesides, they have been united from time immemorial in the nursery\r\nrhyme--\r\n\r\n  “Heigh diddle diddle,\r\n  The cat and the fiddle.”\r\n\r\nAmongst other explanations offered is, the one that it may have\r\noriginated with the sign of a certain _Caton fidèle_, a staunch\r\nProtestant in the reign of Queen Mary, and only have been changed into\r\nthe cat and fiddle by corruption; but, if so, it must have lost its\r\noriginal appellation very soon, for as early as 1589 we find “Henry\r\nCarr, signe of the Catte and Fidle in the Old Chaunge.” Formerly, there\r\nwas a Cat and Fiddle at Norwich, the cat being represented playing upon\r\na fiddle, and a number of mice dancing round her. The bagpipes being the\r\nnational instrument of the Irish, the sign is there frequently changed\r\ninto the CAT AND BAGPIPES. This was also, some twenty or thirty years\r\nago, a public- and chop-house, of considerable notoriety, at the corner\r\nof Downing Street, Westminster, where the clerks of the Foreign Office\r\nused to lunch; at the present day, it is the sign of a public-house near\r\nMoate, King’s Co., Ireland. The APE AND BAGPIPES occurs on trades tokens\r\nas the sign of John Tayler, in St Ann’s Lane. This, too, was a joke not\r\nconfined to our country, for in the marginal illustrations to the\r\ntitle-page of “P. Dioscoridæ Pharmacorum Simplicum,” &c., printed at\r\nStrasburg by John Schot in 1529, an ape is represented playing on the\r\nbagpipes, and a camel dancing to the tune, with these words, χαμηλον\r\nαλλαπτεν. The French were equally fond of this kind of caricature. The\r\nSPINNING SOW (_la Truie qui file_) is common even at the present day,\r\nand has given its name to more than one street in Paris and other\r\ncities. It is said to have originated from a legend:--A certain\r\nChristian queen, Pedauca, whose honour was in danger, imitated the\r\nchaste heroines of mythology; but, instead of praying to be\r\nmetamorphosed into a tree or a bird, she merely asked to have one of her\r\nfeet changed into a goose’s foot, which was enough to frighten her\r\nardent lover away.[627] Another young lady, under similar circumstances,\r\npreferred going the whole hog,--to use a colloquialism,--and was changed\r\ninto a sow, merely praying to be permitted to keep her spindle, as a\r\ntoken of her former condition: hence the sign. It is also--(and hence,\r\nprobably, the legend of the metamorphosis, to remove the prejudices of\r\nthe godly)--represented in relief carving on the exterior of the\r\ncathedral of Chartres. In the Fishmarket of the same town there is a\r\nstone carved sign of a _Donkey playing on a Hurdy-gurdy_, (L’ANE QUI\r\nVEILLE.) Both this sign and another, representing a _Cat playing at\r\nRacket_, (LA CHATTE QUI PELOTE,) have transmitted their names to streets\r\nin Paris. The French seem to have delighted above all things in such\r\ncomicalities. Besides those named above, they had _the Fishing Cat_, (LA\r\nCHATTE QUI PÊCHE,) the _Dancing Goat_, (LA CHÈVRE QUI DANCE,) both of\r\nwhich Walpole mentions. We have one modern sign in London of this\r\nclass--namely, the WHISTLING OYSTER, the name of an oyster-shop in Drury\r\nLane.\r\n\r\nThe JACKANAPES ON HORSEBACK was, unfortunately for the monkeys, a\r\npainful truth. A jackanapes or monkey on horseback was generally the\r\nwinding-up of a bear or bull baiting at Paris Garden. Hollinshed, in his\r\nChronicles, anno 1562, relates how, at the reception of the Danish\r\nambassadors at Greenwich--\r\n\r\n  “For the diversion of the populace, there was a horse with an ape on\r\n  his back which highly pleased them, so that they expressed their\r\n  inward conceived joy and delight with shrill shouts and variety of\r\n  gestures.”\r\n\r\nThe “inward conceived joy,” we may safely conclude, was not expressed by\r\neither the monkey or the horse, particularly when we remember that in\r\nthose days dogs were often let in the ring to frighten both the horse\r\nand its animal Mazeppa. The prevalence of this sport is to be inferred\r\nfrom an admonition to Parliament by Tho. Cartwright, published in 1572,\r\nin order to show the impropriety of an established form of prayer for\r\nthe church services, in which he remarks that the clergyman\r\n\r\n  “Posteth it over as fast as he can galope, for eyther he has two\r\n  places to serve, or else there are some games to be playde in the\r\n  afternoon, as lying for the whetstone,[628] heathenish dauncing for\r\n  the ring, a beare or a bull to be baited, or else a _jackanapes to\r\n  ride on horsebacke_, or an interlude to be playde in the church. We\r\n  speak not of [bell-] ringing after matins is done.”\r\n\r\nNot much more than ten years ago, the good people of Paris were, every\r\nThursday afternoon, in the summer, entertained in the Hippodrome, with\r\n“jackanapes on horseback,” dressed up like Arabs, and followed by\r\nminiature _chasseurs d’Afrique_, to the great gratification of our\r\nmartial neighbours. This sign is named in an advertisement, of the year\r\n1700, for a mare stolen by a “lusty black man with a brown coat,”[629]\r\nnotice of the mare to be given “to Mr John Wright, at the _Jackanapes_\r\non Horseback,” in Cheapside. The grinning, or, as it was written,\r\n“GRENNING IACKANAPES,” is a sign mentioned by Eliot in his “Fruits for\r\nthe French,” or “Parlement of Pratlers,” 1593, “ouer against the\r\nVnicorne in the Iewrie.” The HOG IN ARMOUR, in Hanging Sword Court,\r\nFleet Street, is mentioned in an advertisement,[630] in 1678, as the\r\nplace where there was to be sold “seacole sutt for the great improvement\r\nof all sorts of lands, as well as gardens and hop grounds.” It is named\r\namongst the absurd London signs in the _Spectator_ 28, April 2, 1711,\r\nand is still occasionally seen, as in James’ Street, Dublin. Though the\r\nsign does not exist any longer in London, yet the name is not lost among\r\nthe lower orders, it being a favourite epithet applied to rifle\r\nvolunteers by costermongers, street fishmongers, and such like. A\r\njocular name for this sign is the “_pig in misery_.” There is also a\r\nGOAT IN ARMOUR on the Narrow Quay, Bristol, and a GOAT IN BOOTS on the\r\nFulham Road, Little Chelsea. In 1663 this house was called the GOAT,\r\nand enjoyed the right of commonage for two cows and one heifer upon\r\nChelsea Heath.\r\n\r\n  “How the goat became equipped in boots, and the designation of the\r\n  house changed, have been the subject of various conjectures, the most\r\n  probable of which is, that it originated in a corruption of the latter\r\n  part of the Dutch legend--\r\n\r\n  ‘Mercurius is _der Goden Boode_,’\r\n  (Mercury is the messenger of the gods,)--\r\n\r\n  which being divided between each side of the sign, bearing the figure\r\n  of a Mercury--a sign commonly used in the early part of the last\r\n  century [?] to denote that post-horses were to be obtained--‘der Goden\r\n  Boode’ became freely translated into English, ‘the Goat in Boots.’ To\r\n  Le Blond[631] is attributed the execution of this sign and its motto;\r\n  but whoever the original artist may have been, or the intermediate\r\n  re-touchers or re-painters of the god, certain it is that the pencil\r\n  of Morland, in accordance with the desire of the landlord, either\r\n  transformed the Petasus of Mercury into the horned head of a goat, his\r\n  talaria into spurs upon boots of huge dimension, and his caduceus into\r\n  a cutlass, or thus decorated the original sign, thereby liquidating a\r\n  score which he had run up here, without any other means of payment\r\n  than what his pencil afforded. The sign, however, has been painted\r\n  over, with additional embellishments from gold leaf, so that not the\r\n  least trace of Morland’s work remains, except, perhaps, the\r\n  outline.”[632]\r\n\r\nWith all deference to the opinion of Mr Croker, we cannot help thinking\r\nof this, as of many other signboard explanations, “_Se non è vero è ben\r\ntrovato_.” 1^{o}. the house was called the Goat in 1663; 2^{o}. there is\r\nno proof that it ever was called the Mercury, (nor was that sign ever so\r\ncommon as Mr Croker asserts.) From the following quotation it will\r\nappear that as early as 1738 some Goats in Boots had already appeared,\r\nnot the result of any mythological metamorphosis. The _Craftsman_ for\r\nJune 17, 1738, in ridiculing some lenient measures taken by Government,\r\nblames the signs for putting a martial spirit in the nation, and\r\nproposes that “no lion should be drawn rampant, but couchant; and none\r\nof his teeth ought to be seen without this inscription, ‘Though he shows\r\nhis teeth he wont bite.’ All bucks, bulls, rams, stags, unicorns, and\r\nall other warlike animals ought to be drawn without horns. Let no\r\ngeneral be drawn in armour, and instead of truncheons let them have\r\nmuster-rolls in their hands. In like manner, I would have all admirals\r\npainted in a frock and jockey cap, like landed gentlemen. The common\r\nsign of the two Fighting Cocks might be better changed to a Cock and\r\nHen, and that of the Valiant Trooper to a _Hog in Armour_, or a GOAT IN\r\nJACKBOOTS, _as some Hampshire and Welsh publicans have done already_ for\r\nthe honour of their respective countries.” The sign, then, seems to be a\r\nsort of caricature of a Welshman, the Goat having always been considered\r\nthe emblem of that nation, and the jackboots an indispensable article of\r\nTaffy’s costume. Thus, Captain Grose, in his “Essay on\r\nCaricatures,”[633] mentions a Welshman with his _goat_, leek,\r\n_hay-boots_, and long pedigree, as a standard joke. Not improbably the\r\nswitch carried by the goat on this sign was originally a leek. Of the\r\nsame origin is the well-known WELSH TROOPER, representing a man with a\r\nleek in his hat riding on a goat. This sign may still be seen in London.\r\nIn the Roxburghe ballads the Welshman with his jackboots and leek occurs\r\nin an old woodcut; in other places he is drawn riding a goat, and\r\nsimilarly dressed.\r\n\r\nPUSS IN BOOTS occurs at Windley, Duffield, near Derby. The Goat in Boots\r\nmay have suggested the idea of making a sign of this nursery-tale hero.\r\nThe Dutch shoemakers, in pursuance of the proverb, seem to have taken a\r\nparticular delight in these booted animals. Various creatures in boots\r\noccur amongst the Dutch signboard inscriptions of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. One was the OX IN BOOTS, (_in den gelaarsden os_,) with this\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\n  “’t Leer geeft den Schoenmaker de os daar hy schoenen van maakt om te\r\n  verslyten;\r\n  Ik heb den os weer met leer tot dank gelaerst en gespoord doen\r\n  conterfyten.”[634]\r\n\r\nAnother innkeeper put up the COW IN BOOTS, (_de gelaersden koe_,) and\r\nwrote beneath:--\r\n\r\n  “Ziet dees koe heeft laarzen aan\r\n  Was ’t noch een Bul dan kon het gaan.”[635]\r\n\r\nA third, in Amsterdam, had the COCK IN BOOTS, (_de gelaarsde Haan_,)\r\nwith the following extraordinary rhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “Dit is de gelaarsde haan\r\n  Christus is naar ’t kruys gegaan,\r\n  Met een doornenkroon op ’t hoofd.\r\n  Hy slacht Thomas die ’t niet gelooft.”[636]\r\n\r\nThe JACKASS IN BOOTS (_de gelaarsde ezel_) was the sign of a publican,\r\nwith this inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “In den gelaarsden ezel zeer kloek,\r\n  Verkoopt men toebak, brandewyn, en knapkoek.”[637]\r\n\r\nThe Dog also appears dressed, as the DOG IN DOUBLET, a sign which may be\r\nseen at Pyebridge, Derby, at Northbank, Cambridge, and a few other\r\nout-of-the-way places. Dr Johnson did this sign the honour of applying\r\nit as a metaphor. Speaking of an old idea newly expressed, he said: “It\r\nis an old coat with a new facing.” Then (laughing heartily) “it is the\r\nold dog in a new doublet!”[638]\r\n\r\nThe Dog occurs in various other humorous combinations. Ned Ward mentions\r\na famous inn, in Petty Cury, Cambridge--\r\n\r\n  “the sign of the DEVIL’S LAPDOG, kept by an old grizly curmudgeon,\r\n  corniferously wedded to a plump, young, gay, brisk, black, beautiful,\r\n  good landlady, who I afterwards heard had so great a kindness for the\r\n  University, that she had rather see two or three gowns’ men come into\r\n  her house, than a c---- crew of aldermen in all their\r\n  pontificalibusses.”[639]\r\n\r\nThe DOG’S HEAD IN THE POT is mentioned on the Pardoner’s Roll in “Cocke\r\nLorell’s Bote:”--\r\n\r\n  “Also Annys Angry with the croked buttocke\r\n  That dwelled at y^{e} sygne of ye Dogges hede in ye Pot,\r\n  By her crafte a brechemaker.”\r\n\r\nIt seems originally to have been a mock sign to indicate a dirty,\r\nslovenly housewife. A woodcut above the second part of the Roxburghe\r\nballad of “The Coaches’ Overthrow” represents various dirty practices.\r\nFrom the upper windows of one of the houses a woman is emptying the\r\nunsavoury contents of a domestic vase almost on the heads of the people\r\nunderneath, and the sign of that house is the Dog’s head in the Pot,\r\nrepresenting a dog licking out a pot. A coarse woodcut sheet of the\r\ncommencement of the last century--evidently copied from a much older\r\noriginal--to judge by the costumes, represents two ancient beldames with\r\nhigh-crowned hats, starched ruffs and collars, and high-heeled boots, in\r\na very disorderly room or kitchen; one of the women wipes a plate with\r\nthe bushy tail of a large dog, whose head is completely buried in a\r\ncapacious pot, which he is licking clean; under it:--\r\n\r\n  “All sluts behold, take view of me,\r\n  Your own good housewifry to see.\r\n  It is (methinks) a cleanly care,\r\n  My dishclout in this sort to spare,\r\n  Whilst Dog, you see, doth lick the pot,\r\n  His taile for dishclout I have got,” &c.\r\n\r\nOne of the Roxburghe Ballads, vol. i., fol. 385, entitled, “Seldome\r\nCleanely,” has the same idea:--\r\n\r\n  “If otherwise she had\r\n  But a dishcloute faile,\r\n  She would set them to the dog to licke,\r\n  And wipe them with hys tayle.”\r\n\r\nIn Holland there is a proverb still in use, to the effect that when a\r\nperson is late for dinner he is said to “find the dog in the pot,” (_hy\r\nvindt den hond in de pot_,) meaning that he has arrived late,--that the\r\nempty pot has been given to the dog to lick out, previously to being\r\nwashed, a custom still daily practised by the peasantry of that country.\r\nThis sign is sometimes also called the DOG AND CROCK, as in the\r\nBlackfriars’ Road; at Michelmouth, Romsey, Hants, and elsewhere. In the\r\nwestern counties the word “crock” is indiscriminately applied to iron or\r\nearthen pots. From the latter application comes the term “_crockery_\r\nware.”\r\n\r\nThe DANCING DOGS was a sign at Battlebridge in 1668, as appears from the\r\ntrades tokens. This kind of canine entertainment was one of the\r\nattractions of Bartholomew Fair, where Ben Jonson mentions “dogs that\r\ndance the Morris.”\r\n\r\nThe LAUGHING DOG (_le chien qui rit_) was formerly a sign in Rouen, and\r\ngave its name to a street, now called Du Guay Troin, from the name of a\r\ncelebrated admiral. This was one of those quaint signs of which we have\r\nsome specimens in this country, as the TWO SNEEZING CATS, which is said\r\nto be somewhere in London; the FLYING MONKEY, Lambeth; the MONKEY\r\nISLAND, at Bray, near Maidenhead; the GAPING GOOSE, at Leeds, Oldham,\r\nand various parts of Yorkshire; and the LOVING LAMB, two in Dudley. In\r\nParis there was the old sign of the GREEN MONKEY, (_le singe vert_,) and\r\nsome fifteen years ago Lille could boast of the HUNCHBACKED CATS (_les\r\nchats bossus_) in the Rue Sec-Arembault.\r\n\r\nEqually absurd is the COW AND SNUFFERS, at Llandaff, Glamorgan. In a\r\nplay of George Colman, entitled the “Review, or the Wags of Windsor,”\r\nthe following lines occur:--\r\n\r\n  “Judy’s a darling; my kisses she suffers;\r\n    She’s an heiress, that’s clear,\r\n        For her father sells beer,\r\n  He keeps the sign of the _Cow and the Snuffers_.”\r\n\r\nThe same song also occurs in the “Irishman in London, or the Happy\r\nAfrican.” At Llandaff the sign is represented by a cow standing near a\r\nditch full of reeds and grasses, with a pair of snuffers, placed as if\r\nthey had fallen from the cow’s mouth. The oddity of the combination in\r\nall probability pleased a publican who had heard the song, and adopted\r\nit forthwith as his sign, leaving the arrangement of the objects to the\r\ntaste of the sign-painter.\r\n\r\nThe COLT AND CRADLE might have been seen in St Martin’s Lane in 1667. It\r\nis still a common sign for houses of evil repute in Holland, as may be\r\nseen from two examples in the Zandstraat, Rotterdam, where the cradle is\r\ncarved above the door, with the colt in it lying on his back: the\r\ninscription is, “Het paard in de Wieg,” (the horse in the cradle.) And\r\nsince, according to Stow, in ancient times “English people disdayned to\r\nbe bawdes, froes of Flaunders were women for that purpose,” it is more\r\nthan probable that these “froes” introduced this sign from their own\r\ncountry. In the Dutch language _paar_ means “a couple,” and is\r\nconstantly used for a man and woman, either united by the bands of\r\nlawful marriage or otherwise. The original form of the sign, then, we\r\nsuppose was “the couple in the cradle,” (_het paar in de wieg_.) But the\r\nDutch have an inveterate habit of adding diminutives, so that with this\r\nappendix it became _paartje_--from paar_t_je to paar_d_je, a small\r\nhorse, the transition was easy enough; and, covered with that\r\ntransparent veil, the indelicate sign has come down to the present day.\r\nThis seems so much the more probable to be the meaning, since the\r\n_Cradle_ in London also was a “bad sign,” (see p. 394.)\r\n\r\nThe GOOSE AND GRIDIRON occurs at Woodhall, Lincolnshire, and in a few\r\nother localities: it is said to owe its origin to the following\r\ncircumstances:--The Mitre (see p. 319) was a celebrated music-house in\r\nLondon House Yard, at the N.-W. end of St Paul’s. When it ceased to be a\r\nmusic-house, the succeeding landlord, to ridicule its former destiny,\r\nchose for his sign a goose stroking the bars of a gridiron with his\r\nfoot, in ridicule of the SWAN AND HARP, a common sign for the early\r\nmusic-houses. Such an origin does the _Tatler_ give; but it may also be\r\na vernacular reading of the coat of arms of the Company of Musicians,\r\nsuspended probably at the door of the Mitre when it was a music-house.\r\nThese arms are, a swan with his wings expanded, within a double\r\ntressure, counter, flory, argent. This double tressure might have\r\nsuggested a gridiron to unsophisticated passers-by. PADDY’S GOOSE is, at\r\nthe present day, a nickname for a public-house in Shadwell called the\r\nWhite Swan; but why it was thus travestied _non liquet_. This tavern\r\nacquired some notoriety during the Crimean campaign. When the Government\r\nwanted sailors to man the fleet, the landlord of the house used to go\r\namong the shipping in the river and enlist numbers of men. His system of\r\nrecruiting was to go in one of the small steamers, with flags and\r\ncolours flying and a band playing, the heart-stirring or heart-rending\r\nnotes of which used to awaken the martial ardour of the merchant\r\nsailors, and make them enlist in the Royal Navy. This sign also\r\ntriumphantly proclaims the presence of British gin and Irish whisky in a\r\nlow public-house near the harbour of La Valette at Malta.\r\n\r\nNot a few signs represent proverbs or proverbial expressions. The BIRD\r\nIN HAND, for instance, with occasionally the BOOK IN HAND,--the former\r\ndenoting the landlord’s full appreciation of the truth of the proverb,\r\n“One bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” It is frequently\r\naccompanied by the following truthful rather than grammatical distich:--\r\n\r\n  “A bird in hand far better ’tis\r\n  Than two that in the bushes is.”\r\n\r\nThis sign occurs among the trades tokens, being literally rendered by a\r\nhand holding a bird. Innumerable are the jokes resorted to by landlords\r\nto intimate that hard truth that no credit is given.[640] Frequently the\r\npill is gilt in the most agreeable manner: a deceptive hope of “better\r\nluck to-morrow” is frequently held out, as\r\n\r\n  “Drink here, and drown all sorrow;\r\n  Pay to-day, I’ll trust to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nOr:--\r\n\r\n  “Pay to-day and trust to-morrow,\r\n  And so endeth all our sorrow.”\r\n\r\nThe same in Holland:--\r\n\r\n  “Vandaag voor geld, morgen voor niet.”[641]\r\n\r\nIn Italy a cock is sometimes painted, with the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Quando questo gallo cantarà\r\n  Allora credenza si farà.”[642]\r\n\r\nThe inventive genius of the French, with its usual fondness for romance,\r\nhas constructed a little dramatic incident to express the idea:--\r\n\r\n  “Crédit est mort; les mauvais payeurs l’ont tué.”[643]\r\n\r\nWhich phrase was seen by Coryatt, nearly two centuries ago, on one of\r\nthe inns where he put up at in France: a similar idea is expressed at\r\nSmethwick in the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n  “Sacred to the memory of Poor Trust, who fought hard at the battle of\r\n  Deception, but fell under General Bad Pay.”\r\n\r\nA print hung up in a public-house in Nottingham, depicting a black\r\ntombstone (or signboard,--it is difficult to say which) spotted with\r\nbriny white tears, gives the inscription with still greater force:--\r\n\r\n  “This monument is erected to the memory of Mr Trust, who was some time\r\n  since most shamefully and cruelly murdered by a villain called Credit,\r\n  who is prowling about, both in town and country, seeking whom he may\r\n  devour.”\r\n\r\nOthers have the picture of a dead dog, and under him:--\r\n\r\n  “Died last night, Poor Trust! Who killed him? Bad Pay.”\r\n\r\nA very general inscription is:--\r\n\r\n  “This is a good world to live in,\r\n  To lend, or to spend, or to give in;\r\n  But to beg or to borrow, or to get a man’s own,\r\n  It is such a world as never was known.”\r\n\r\nOr:--\r\n\r\n  “The rule of this house, and it can’t be unjust,\r\n  Is to pay on delivery, and not to give trust;\r\n  I’ve trusted many to my sorrow,\r\n  Pay to-day, I’ll trust to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nStuck up in many tap-rooms may be seen the following:--\r\n\r\n  “All you that bring tobacco here\r\n  Must pay for pipes as well as beer;\r\n  And you that stand before the fire,\r\n  I pray sit down by good desire,\r\n  That other folks as well as you\r\n  May see the fire, and feel it too.\r\n  Since man to man is so unjust,\r\n  I cannot tell what man to trust.\r\n  My liquor’s good, ’tis no man’s sorrow,\r\n  Pay to-day, I’ll trust to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nAt an ale-house in Ranston, Norfolk, the usual information is conveyed\r\nin the following manner, (to be read upwards, beginning from the bottom\r\nof the last column):--\r\n\r\n  MORE     BEER     SCORE    CLERK\r\n  FOR      MY       MY       THEIR\r\n  DO       TRUST    PAY      SENT\r\n  I        I        MUST     HAVE\r\n  SHALL    IF       I        BREWERS\r\n  WHAT     AND      AND      MY\r\n\r\nAt other places it comes in a still more “questionable shape,” reminding\r\nus of the curious literary conceits of the old monkish rhymesters. In\r\nthe following, the letters must be connected into words, thus--_The\r\nbrewer_, &c.\r\n\r\n  Th.  ebr:  Ewe  !  Rh.  eH.  Ass?\r\n      en . THI.S. cLEr\r\n  k a N d  ! IM. ustp,  A.  YM.

Or .e.\r\n\r\nThe little wayside inn, between Pateley Bridge and Ripon, has the\r\nfollowing plaintive appeal to a stiffnecked race:--\r\n\r\n    “The malster doth crave\r\n    His money to have,\r\n  The exciseman says have I must.\r\n    By that you can see\r\n    How the case stands with me;\r\n  So I pray you don’t ask me for trust.”\r\n\r\nA small beer-house at Werrington, in Devonshire, yclept the Lengdon Inn,\r\nhas:--\r\n\r\n  “Gentlemen, walk in, and sit at your ease,\r\n  Pay what you call for, and call what you please;\r\n  As trusting of late has been to my sorrow,\r\n  Pay me to-day, and I’ll trust ee to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThe Maypole, near Hainault Forest, has:--\r\n\r\n  “My liquor’s good,\r\n  My measures just;\r\n  Excuse me, sirs!\r\n  I cannot trust.”\r\n\r\nAt Preston, in Lancashire:--\r\n\r\n  “Greadley Bob, he does live here,\r\n  And sells a pot of good strong beer;\r\n  His liquor’s good, his measure just,\r\n  But Bob’s so poor he cannot trust.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.\r\n\r\nHAT AND BEAVER.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1750.)\r\n\r\nSWAN WITH TWO NECKS.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1785.)\r\n\r\nHARROW AND DOUBLET.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1700.)\r\n\r\nMAN IN THE MOON.\r\n\r\n(Vine Street, Regent Street; modern.)\r\n\r\nTHE APE.\r\n\r\n(Stone carving, Philip Lane, Barbican, 1670.)]\r\n\r\nThe Green Man, on Finchley Common, under a trophy composed of two pipes\r\ncrossed and a pot of beer, presents us with the following:--\r\n\r\n          “Call. Softly,\r\n          Drink. Moderate\r\n          Pay. _Honourably_,\r\n          Be Good. _Company_\r\n          Part. _FRIENDLY_\r\n          Go. =HOME=. quietly.\r\n  _Let those lines be no MANS Sorrow_\r\n  _Pay to_ =DAY= _and i’ll_ =TRUST= _to Morrow_.”\r\n\r\nAt Middleton, Co. Cork, the verses usually accompanying the sign of the\r\nBee-hive are slightly altered to meet the emergency of the case, _surgit\r\namari aliquid_:--\r\n\r\n  “Within this hive we’re all alive\r\n  With whisky sweet as honey;\r\n  If you are dry, step in and try,\r\n  But don’t forget the money.”\r\n\r\nSo old is the necessity of informing the public that they must pay for\r\nwhat they obtain, that even in the ruined city of Pompeii a similar\r\ncaution is found. Above the door of a house, once inhabited by a\r\nsurgeon, occurs the following laconic intimation:--“EME ET HABEBIS.” And\r\nso widely spread is the evil, that even in Chinese towns the shopkeepers\r\nhave found it necessary to inform the public on their signs--\r\n\r\n  “Former customers have inspired us with caution; no credit given\r\n  here.”\r\n\r\nOne publican, at Littletown, in Durham, seems to have taken a somewhat\r\nopposite view, putting up, for a sign, the BIRD IN THE BUSH, but it may\r\nbe doubted if his experience has confirmed him in a preference of the\r\nbird in the bush to the bird in the hand.\r\n\r\nAnother proverb illustrated is the COW AND HARE, at Stafford, Bottisham,\r\n(near Newmarket,) and other places, evidently suggested by the adage, “A\r\ncow may catch a hare.” This sign is mentioned, about 1708, in a rather\r\ncurious memorandum from the pen of Partridge, the almanac-maker, at the\r\ncommencement of a book of “the Cælestial Motions and Aspects for the\r\nyears of our Lord 1708 to 1720.”[644] The MS. note is as follows:--“At\r\nthe Cowe and Hare by Whitechappel Church, a rare rogue lives there, a\r\npickpocket.” Of the same class as the Cow and Hare is WHO’D HA’ THOUGHT\r\nIT? which sometimes is seen on an ale-house sign, as, for instance, at\r\nNorth End, Fulham. A wag suggested this as the motto to the coat-of-arms\r\nof a certain baronet-brewer:\r\n\r\n  “Who’d ha’ thought it?\r\n  Hops had bought it.”\r\n\r\nThe sign of the JOLLY BREWER--WHO’D HA’ THOUGHT IT? occurs in the Jersey\r\nRoad, Hounslow. Originally, it seems to have implied that, after a hard\r\nstruggle in some other walk of life, the landlord had succeeded in\r\nopening the long-wished-for ale-house. So in Holland: many country\r\nretreats of retired tradespeople bear such names as “_Nooit gedacht_,”\r\n(never expected,) &c.\r\n\r\nWHY NOT, the name of a public-house at Essington, in Staffordshire,\r\nseems to imply quite the reverse, and to have been adopted as the motto\r\nof a more sanguine landlord; unless it may be considered as a ready\r\nanswer to the often-repeated question, before “popping in round the\r\ncorner,” “Shall we have a drop?”\r\n\r\nThe LAME DOG is very common; but is particularly appropriate at Brierley\r\nHill, near Dudley, the establishment being kept by a collier, rendered\r\nlame in a pit accident. Under a pictorial representation of a lame dog\r\ntrying to get over a stile, the following appeal is made to the thirsty\r\nand benevolent public:--\r\n\r\n  “Stop, my friends, and stay awhile\r\n  To help the Lame Dog over the stile.”\r\n\r\nSometimes, as at Bulmer, Essex, we see a somewhat similar idea expressed\r\nby a man struggling through a globe--head and arms protruding on one\r\nside, his legs on the other--with the inscription, “HELP ME THROUGH THIS\r\nWORLD.” The same allegory might have been seen on a beer-house in\r\nHolland in the seventeenth century, but the inscription was\r\ndifferent--“_Dus na ben ik door de wereld_,” (“Thus far I have got\r\nthrough the world.”) This sign is also called the STRUGGLER, or the\r\nSTRUGGLING MAN, and at Hampton, where the house is kept by a widow, the\r\nWIDOW’S STRUGGLE. In Salop Street, Dudley, the struggle is represented\r\nby a man, with a dog beside him, walking against a strong head wind. The\r\nLIVE AND LET LIVE has a somewhat similar meaning; it occurs at North\r\nEnd, Fulham, and in many other places. To this class, also, the\r\nfollowing seems to refer:--“A witty, though unfortunate, fellow having\r\ntryed all trades, but thriving by none, took the pot for his last\r\nrefuge, and set up an ale-house, with the sign of the SHIRT, inscribed\r\nunder it, ‘This is my last shift.’ Much company was brought him thereby,\r\nand much profit.”[645] Nathaniel Oldham, the friend of Sir Hans Sloane,\r\nDoctor Mead, and the leading _virtuosi_ of that time, himself a\r\ncollector, as well as a sporting man, at last got so reduced in\r\ncircumstances that he had to dispose of his curiosities and\r\nsuperfluities. He opened his house, therefore, as a curiosity shop, and\r\nwrote over the door, _Oldham’s last Shift_. Unfortunately, it _was_ his\r\n“last shift,” for scarcely had he opened his shop when one of his\r\ninnumerable creditors had him arrested and sent to King’s Bench Prison,\r\nwhere he died. J. T. Smith, in his “Cries of London,” tells a similar\r\ndevice of a sailor, maimed at the battle of Trafalgar, who used to go\r\nabout town with a wheelbarrow of ginger nuts, which he called “Jack’s\r\nlast shift.”\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty of success in trade is expressed by the sign of the TWO\r\nCHANCES; and HIT OR MISS, the good and the bad chance which innkeepers,\r\nas well as all other mortals, have to run in this transitory world. This\r\nsign occurs at Hannington, Northampton, and at Clun, in Salop. At\r\nOpenshaw, near Manchester, a similar idea is expressed by a sign\r\nrepresenting two men running a race, which seems to promise a dead heat,\r\nwith the inscription, LUCK’S ALL.\r\n\r\nOthers have a sort of satirical humour in them, such as the well-known\r\nFOUR ALLS, representing a king who says, “I rule all;” a priest who\r\nsays, “I pray for all;” a soldier who says, “I fight for all;” and John\r\nBull, or a farmer, who says, “I pay for all.” Sometimes a fifth is added\r\nin the shape of a lawyer, who says, “I plead for all.” It is an old and\r\nstill common sign, and may even be seen swinging under the blue sky in\r\nthe sunny streets of La Valette, Malta. In Holland, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury, it was used, but the king was left out, and a lawyer added;\r\neach person said exactly the same as on our signboards, but the farmer\r\nanswered:--\r\n\r\n  “Of gy vecht, of gy bidt, of gy pleyt,\r\n  Ik ben de boer die de eyeren leyt.”[646]\r\n\r\nThe author of “Tavern Anecdotes” observes that he used to notice in\r\nRosemary Street, the sign of the Four Alls, but passing that way some\r\ntime after, he found it altered into the _Four Awls_; the sign painter\r\nwho renewed the picture had probably found himself not equal to a\r\nrepresentation of the four human figures. In Ireland, a similar\r\ncorruption may be observed, the four shoemaker’s awls taking the place\r\nof the four representatives of society. Although having no connexion\r\nwith the Four Alls, it may be mentioned that three and four awls\r\nconstitute the charges in the shoemakers’ arms of some of the\r\ncontinental trade societies or guilds.\r\n\r\nThis enumeration of the various performances coupled with the word _all_\r\nhas been used in numerous different epigrams: an address to James I. in\r\nthe Ashmolean MSS., No. 1730, has:--\r\n\r\n  “THE LORDS craved all,\r\n  THE QUEENE graunted all,\r\n  THE LADIES of honour ruled all,\r\n  THE LORD-KEEPER seal’d all,\r\n  THE INTELLIGENCER marred all,\r\n  THE PARLIAMENT pass’d all,\r\n  HE THAT IS GONE oppos’d himself to all,\r\n  THE BISHOPS soothed all,\r\n  THE JUDGES pardon’d all,\r\n  THE LORDS buy, ROME spoil’d all,\r\n  Now, GOOD KING, mend all,\r\n  Or else THE DEVIL will have all.”\r\n\r\nThis again seems to have been imitated from a similar description of the\r\nState of Spain in Greene’s “Spanish Masquerade,” 1589:--\r\n\r\n  “THE CARDINALLS solicit all,\r\n  THE KING grauntes all,\r\n  THE NOBLES confirm all,\r\n  THE POPE determines all,\r\n  THE CLEARGIE disposeth all,\r\n  THE DUKE of Medina hopes for all,\r\n  ALONSO receives all,\r\n  THE INDIANS minister all,\r\n  THE SOLDIERS eat all,\r\n  THE PEOPLE paie all,\r\n  THE MONKS and friars consume all,\r\n  And THE DEVIL at length will carry away all.”\r\n\r\nThe NAKED BOY was a satirical sign reflecting upon the constant changes\r\nof the fashions of our ancestors. William Herbert has this observation\r\nin his manuscript memoranda, “I remember very well when I was a lad\r\nseeing on Windmill Hill, Moorfields, a taylor’s sign, a _naked boy_ with\r\nthis couplet:--\r\n\r\n  “So fickle is our English nation,\r\n  I wou’d be clothed if I knew the fashion.”[647]\r\n\r\nThe same idea is expressed in the “Introduction to Knowledge,” by Andrew\r\nBorde, (the original “Merry Andrew,”) Doctor of Physick, 1542, where a\r\n_naked man_ is introduced undecided as to the style of dress he should\r\nadopt on account of the continual change in the fashions:--\r\n\r\n  “Now am I a frysker, all men doth on me looke,\r\n  What should I do but set cocke on the hoope,\r\n  What do I care yf all the worlde me fayle,\r\n  I will get a garment shall reche to my tayle.”\r\n\r\nCoryatt also reflects upon this ever-varying change in his\r\n“Crudities:”--“For whereas they [the gentlemen of Venice] have but one\r\ncolour, we use many more than are in the rainbow; all the most light\r\ngarish and unseemly colours that are in the world. Also for fashion we\r\nare much inferior to them: for we weare more phantastical fashions than\r\nany nation vnder the Sunne doth, the French onely excepted; which hath\r\ngiven occasion to the Venetians and other Italians to brand the\r\nEnglishmen with a notable mark of levity by painting him stark naked\r\nwith a pair of shears in his hand, making his fashion of attire\r\naccording to the vain conception of his brain sick head, not to\r\ncomeliness and decorum.”\r\n\r\nSo ancient is this complaint as to the versatility of our fashions that\r\nwe verily believe even our tattooed forefathers must have been\r\nconstantly altering the hue of their blue stencilling, and bedaubing\r\nthemselves with new patterns. John Harding, in his “Chronicles,” of the\r\nreign of Richard II., describing the various materials and cuts of the\r\n“unpayed doublettes and gownes,” even long before his time, says, ch.\r\n193:--\r\n\r\n  “Broudur and furres and goldsmith werke ay newe,\r\n  In many a wyse eche day they did renewe.”\r\n\r\nDouglas, the monk of Glastonbury, wrote not less angrily in the days of\r\nEdward III:\r\n\r\n  “Englyshmen hawnted so moche unto the folye of strawngers that fro\r\n  that tyme every yere thei chaungedde them in diverse schappes and\r\n  disgisingges of clothengge now long, now large, now wide, now streite,\r\n  and every day clothingges newe destitute and deserte from alle honeste\r\n  of holde array and gode usage.”[648]\r\n\r\nIndeed so angry does the good monk become about these extravagant\r\nfashions, that he says,--“If I sethe shalle say, they weren more like to\r\nturmentours and Diviles in their clothing and also in schoyng and other\r\naray that they semed no menne.”\r\n\r\nNot only did we invent, but we borrowed absurd foreign fashions. Samuel\r\nRowland, in “The Letting of Humours Blood in the Head Vaine,” 1611,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  “Behold a most accomplish’d cavaleere,\r\n  That the world’s ape of fashions doth appeare;\r\n  Walking the streete his humours to disclose,\r\n  In the French dowblet and the German hose,\r\n  The muffes, cloake, Spanish hat, Tolledo blade,\r\n  Italian ruffe, a shoe right Flemish made,\r\n  Like the Lord of Misrule, where he comes he’ll revel.”\r\n\r\nAnd Heywood, in the “Rape of Lucrece,” 1638, epigr. xxvi., has:--\r\n\r\n  “The Spaniard loves his ancient slop,\r\n  The Lombard his Venetian;\r\n  And some like breechless women go,\r\n  The Russ, Turk, Jew, and Grecian;\r\n  The thrifty Frenchman wears small waist,\r\n  The Dutchman his belly boasteth,\r\n  The Englishman is for them all,\r\n  And for each fashion coasteth.”\r\n\r\nShakespeare seems to allude to the sign of the Naked Boy in his “Comedy\r\nof Errors,” act iv., scene 3, where Dromio says, “What, have you got the\r\npicture of old Adam new apparell’d.” At Skipton-in-Craven, there is\r\nstill a stone bas-relief of the Naked Boy, fixed in the front of a\r\nhouse, with the date 1633.\r\n\r\nThe GOOD WOMAN, or the SILENT WOMEN, and at Pershore, in Worcestershire,\r\nthe QUIET WOMAN, represent a headless woman carrying her head in her\r\nhand. Brady, in his “Clavis Calendaria,” vol. ii., p. 203, says, “The\r\nmartyrs who had been decapitated were, therefore, usually represented\r\nwith headless trunks, and the head on some adjoining table, or more\r\ncommonly in their hands; and it was easy for ignorance and credulity not\r\nonly to mistake that type, but to be led into belief that those holy\r\npersons had actually carried their heads about for the benefit of\r\nbelievers.” The sign, yet preserved, particularly by the oilshops, of\r\nthe Good Woman, although originally meant as expressive of some female\r\nsaint, holy or good woman, who had met death by the privation of her\r\nhead, has been converted into a joke against the females whose alleged\r\nloquacity is considered to be satirised by this representation, which,\r\nto conform to such meaning, they now more commonly call the Silent\r\nWoman. The fact, however, of it being particularly an oilman’s sign,\r\nmakes it possible that it may have some reference to the heedless\r\n[_head_ anciently was pronounced _heed_] or foolish virgins of the\r\nparable, who had no oil in their lamps when the bridegroom came. Where\r\nis your head? is still a question addressed to forgetful people.\r\n\r\nThere is a very curious example of this sign at Widford, near\r\nChelmsford, representing on one side a half-length portrait of Henry\r\nVIII., on the reverse, a woman without a head, dressed in the costume of\r\nthe latter half of the last century, with the inscription _Forte Bonne_.\r\nThe addition of the portrait of Henry VIII. has led to the popular\r\nbelief that the headless woman is meant for Anna Boleyn, though probably\r\nit is simply a combination of the KING’S HEAD AND GOOD WOMAN.\r\n\r\nThis sign is equally common on the Continent; the book of Dutch\r\nsignboard inscriptions of the seventeenth century, from which we have\r\nconstantly quoted, gives several verses which figured under various\r\nsigns of the Good Woman. Amongst them the following are worth\r\nnoticing:--\r\n\r\n  “Hier is de goede vrouw te vinden,\r\n  Na ’t leven zeer net afgebeeld,\r\n  Daar niet als ’t hoofd maar aan en scheeld,\r\n  Dewyl dat draait met duizend winden;\r\n  Indien er ’t hoofd was aangebleven\r\n  Sy was nooit goed haar gansche leven.”[649]\r\n\r\nAnother had:--\r\n\r\n  “De vrouw die is een mannen-plaag,\r\n  Al zyn snot-leepels daarna graag;\r\n  Dies als dat vuur is uitgedoofd\r\n  Dan wenschen zy, haar zonder hoofd.”[650]\r\n\r\nIn Italy, also, it is known, and serves as a sign to many an inn.\r\nReaders who may have visited Turin will remember the kind reception of\r\n“la buona Moglie” in that town. In Paris it gives its name to a street,\r\n_Rue de la Femme sans Tête_. The picture in France is generally\r\naccompanied by the legend, “_Tout en est bon_,” the absence of the head\r\nprobably implying “_fors la tête_,” except the head; _ergo_, everything\r\nis good in woman except her head--her ever-changing whims and fancies.\r\nAt the present day there is, in the Rue St Marguerite, a pork butcher\r\nwho has made the following use of this sign: Under the usual\r\nrepresentation of the Good Woman he has written in golden letters, “Tout\r\nen est bon, depuis les” (a representation of four pigs’ feet) “jusqu’à\r\nla,” (a representation of an enormous boar’s head.) This ungallant\r\nassociation of ideas of a woman and a pig is, we are sorry to say, not\r\nwithout an example in our nation, though fortunately our rudeness was\r\ntwo hundred years ago, and we have grown more refined since:--\r\n\r\n  “One Ambrose Westrop, vicar of the Parish church Much to Sham (?) in\r\n  the county of Essex, taught in a Sermon That a Woman is worse than a\r\n  sow in two respects; First: because a sowskin is good to make a cart\r\n  saddle and her bristles good for a sowter. Secondly: because a sow\r\n  will run away if a man cry but _hoy_, but a woman will not turn her\r\n  head, though beaten down with a leaver, and that all the difference\r\n  between a woman and a sow is in the nape of the neck, where a woman\r\n  can bend upwards, but a sow cannot, etc. The said Westrop is a great\r\n  malignant and very envious and full of venome against the Parliament.\r\n  But his benefit is sequestered, as well he deserves, from his\r\n  filthiness and unfitnesse to the place.”--_Remarkable Passages and\r\n  Occurrences of Parliament_, &c. December 8 to 15, 1644.\r\n\r\nLawyers, priests, and women have, at all times and in all countries,\r\nreceived a liberal share of abuse and slander; no wonder, then, that the\r\nLawyer kept the Good Woman in countenance. In a sign derived from the\r\nGood Woman the man of law is “damned to fame” as the HONEST LAWYER, the\r\nsign representing him with his head in his hand, as the only condition\r\nin which by any possibility he could be honest. Another sign abusive of\r\nthe softer sex is the MAN LOADED WITH MISCHIEF, the sign of an ale-house\r\nin Oxford Street. The original, said to be painted by Hogarth, is\r\nfastened to the front of the house, and has the honour of being\r\nspecified in the lease of the premises as one of the fixtures. An\r\nengraving of it is exhibited in the window. It represents a man carrying\r\na woman, a magpie, and a monkey, the woman with a glass of gin in her\r\nhand. In the background, on the left-hand side, is a public-house with a\r\npair of horns as a “finial” on the gable end; this house is called\r\n“_Cuckhold’s Fortune_;” a woman is passing in at the door, and a sow is\r\nasleep in a pot-house, with a label above, “She is as drunk as a sow,”\r\nwhilst two cats are making love on the roof. On the right-hand side is\r\nthe shop of _S. Gripe, Pawnbroker_, which a carpenter enters to pledge\r\nhis tools. The engraving is signed: “Drawn by Experience; engraved by\r\nSorrow.” Under it is the following rhyme:--\r\n\r\n  “A monkey, a magpie, and a wife,\r\n  Is the true emblem of strife.”\r\n\r\nThis sign has been imitated in other places, sometimes called the\r\nMISCHIEF, as at Blewbury, Wallingford, or the LOAD OF MISCHIEF, as at\r\nNorwich. About twenty years ago there was one to be seen in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cambridge, with this expressive addition, that the man\r\nwas tied to the woman by a chain and padlock. A similarly malicious\r\nreflection on the “softer sex” is seen in many parts of France, as in\r\nParis, Troyes, and various other towns. It is called “_Le trio de\r\nMalice_,” (the three bad ones,) the trio being composed of a cat, a\r\nwoman, and a monkey.\r\n\r\nNOBODY was the singular sign of John Trundell, a ballad-printer in\r\nBarbican in the seventeenth century. In one of Ben Jonson’s plays Nobody\r\nis introduced, “attyred in a payre of Breeches, which were made to come\r\nup to his neck, with his armes out at his pockets and cap drowning his\r\nface.” This comedy was “printed for John Trundle and are to be sold at\r\nhis shop in Barbican at the sygne of No-Body.” A unique ballad,\r\npreserved in the Miller Collection at Britwell House, entitled “The\r\nWell-spoken No-Body,” is accompanied by a woodcut representing a ragged\r\nbarefooted fool on pattens, with a torn money-bag under his arm, walking\r\nthrough a chaos of broken pots, pans, bellows, candlesticks, tongs,\r\ntools, windows, &c. Above him is a scroll in black-letter:--\r\n\r\n  “Nobody . is . my . Name . that . Beyreth . Every . Bodyes .\r\n                           Blame.”\r\n\r\nThe ballad commences as follows:--\r\n\r\n  “Many speke of Robin Hoode that never shott in his bowe,\r\n  So many have layed faultes to me, which I did never knowe;\r\n          But nowe, beholde, here I am,\r\n          Whom all the worlde doeth diffame;\r\n          Long have they also scorned me,\r\n          And locked my mouthe for speking free.\r\n          As many a Godly man they have so served\r\n          Which unto them God’s truth hath shewed;\r\n          Of such they have burned and hanged some,\r\n          That unto their ydolatrye wold not come:\r\n          The Ladye Truthe they have locked in cage,\r\n          Saying of her Nobodye had knowledge.\r\n          For as much nowe as they name Nobodye\r\n          I thinke verilye they speke of me:\r\n          Whereffore to answere I nowe beginne--\r\n          The locke of my mouthe is opened with ginne,\r\n          Wrought by no man, but by God’s grace,\r\n          Unto whom be prayse in every place,” &c.\r\n\r\nIn J. O. Halliwell’s “Shakespeare,” vol. i., p. 450, from whence we\r\nborrow the above, the subject is still further illustrated by the\r\nfollowing quotation:--\r\n\r\n  “Nobody keeps such a rule in every bodies house that from the\r\n  mistresse to the basest maide, there is not a shrewde turne done\r\n  without him: for if the husband finde his study opened and enquire who\r\n  did it? he shall finde Nobody: if the goodwife see her utensils\r\n  disordered and demand who displast them, the issue of every servant’s\r\n  reply will bee, Nobody: if the servants discover the beds towsed and\r\n  the chambers durtied it will bee, Nobody; when every child is\r\n  examined; nay, if the children fall and break their noses, or scratch\r\n  one another’s faces, and either mother or nursse seeme angry and aske,\r\n  who hurt them, they will quickly answer Nobody toucht them; and their\r\n  desire of excuse hath brought lying to a custom.”--_Rich Cabinet\r\n  furnished with Variety of Excellent Description_, 1616.\r\n\r\nAt present there is an inn in Plymouth called NO PLACE inn; and formerly\r\nthere was at Norwich a public-house called NOWHERE--a name which would,\r\nto the truant husband returning home in the small hours of night,\r\nsuggest a ready answer to the warm reception of his partner for better\r\nand for worse, who, for the last few hours, has been\r\n\r\n  “Gath’ring her brows, like gath’ring storm--\r\n  Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.”\r\n\r\nAnother ancient sign, to which constant allusions are made in the old\r\nwriters, is the THREE LOGGERHEADS, which, old as it is, and stale as the\r\njoke may be, has not yet lost its charms for the inhabitants of many of\r\nour villages and quiet inland towns. It represents two silly-looking\r\nfaces, with the inscription--\r\n\r\n  “WE THREE\r\n  LOGGERHEADS BE,”\r\n\r\n--the unsuspecting spectator being, of course, the third. Douce, in his\r\n“Illustrations to Shakespeare,” suggests that the original picture\r\nshould have represented three fools. Thus, in Shirley’s “Bird in Cage,”\r\nMorello, who counterfeits a fool, says, “_We be three of old_, without\r\nexception to your lordship, only with this difference, I am the wisest\r\nfool.” In Day’s “Comedy of Law Tricks,” 1608, Julia says, “Appoint the\r\nplace prest,” to which the answer is, “_At the three fools._” Sometimes,\r\nas Mr Henley has stated, it was two asses. Thus, in Beaumont and\r\nFletcher’s “Queen of Corinth.” ac. iii., sc. 1:--\r\n\r\n  “_Nean._ He is another ass, he says; I believe him.\r\n  _Uncle._ We be three, heroical prince.\r\n  _Nean._ Nay, then we must have the picture and the word _Nos sumus_.”\r\n\r\nIn this form it is still seen on valentines and humorous _cartes de\r\nvisite_. Shakespeare, too, alludes to this sign in “Twelfth Night,” ac.\r\nii., sc. 2:--“How now, my hearts? did you never see the picture of We\r\nThree?” Decker, ridiculing the manners and customs of his day, speaks of\r\nthe fast men sitting on the stage at theatrical representations--“but\r\nassure yourself, by continual residence, you are the first and principal\r\nman in election, to begin the number of _We three_.”[651] In a pamphlet,\r\nentitled, “Heads of all Fashions; being a plain Disection or Definition\r\nof Divers and Sundry Sorts of Heads,” London, 1642, the Loggerheads are\r\nthus mentioned:--\r\n\r\n  “A Logerhead alone cannot well be,\r\n  _At scriveners’ windows many time hang three_.\r\n  A country lobcocke, as I once did heare,\r\n  Upon a penman put a grievous jeare.\r\n  If I had been in place, as this man was,\r\n  I should have called this country coxcomb asse.”\r\n\r\nThis alludes to one of the jokes in “Mother Bunch’s Merriments,” 1604,\r\nwhere a country fellow asks a poor scrivener, sitting in his shop, “I\r\npray you, master, what might you sell in your shop, that you have so\r\nmany ding-dongs hang at your dore?” “Why, my friend,” quoth the\r\nobligation-maker, “I sell nothing but loggerheads.” “By my fay, master,”\r\nquoth the countryman, “you have a fair market with them, for you have\r\nleft but one in your shop, that I see;” and so, laughing, went his way,\r\nleaving much good sport to them that heard him. This old anecdote may\r\nhave given rise to scriveners using the Loggerheads as their sign, which\r\notherwise seems a not very pleasant reflection on their customers. We\r\ncan scarcely think that any symbolism was intended, and that the\r\nLoggerheads were emblematical of the secretary’s silence and discretion.\r\nIn the seventeenth century the sign might have been seen in London.\r\nThere was one in Tooley Street in 1665, having on its trades token the\r\ninscription, “We are 3;” another variety had “We three Logerheads”\r\nunderneath the usual heads. In the ballad of the “Arraigning and\r\nIndicting of Sir John Barleycorn, Knt., printed for Timothy Tosspot,”\r\nthe trial takes place at the Three Loggerheads, by the Justices Oliver\r\nand Old Nick. The witnesses are cited at the sign of the _Three Merry\r\nCompanions in Bedlam_--viz., Poor Robin, Merry Tom, and Jack Lackwit.\r\n\r\nThe LABOUR IN VAIN occurs among the trades tokens, and such a sign gave\r\nits name to Old Fish Street, which Hatton, in his “New View of London,”\r\n1708, p. 405, calls “Old Fish Street, or Labour in Vain Hill.” The sign\r\nrepresented two women scrubbing a negro; hence it was called by the\r\nlower classes, the DEVIL IN A TUB. “To wash an Æthiop,” is a proverbial\r\nexpression, often met with in ancient dramatists, for labour in\r\nvain.[652] THE CASE IS ALTERED, generally alludes to some alteration in\r\nthe affairs of the landlord, either “for better or for worse.” A\r\npublic-house near Banbury was so called on account of being built on the\r\nsite of a mere hovel. Another house of the same name was, in 1805,\r\nerected on the road between Woodbridge and Ipswich, to meet the demand\r\nof the thirsty sons of Mars then quartered in those two towns. Its sign\r\nin those days was the Duke of York, or some such name. But when, after\r\nthe downfall of the “Corsican Tyrant,” and the subsequent declaration of\r\npeace, the barracks were pulled down, the soldiers disbanded, and the\r\nbenches of the ale-house remained empty, the old sign was removed, and\r\nin its place put up the sad truth--“The Case is Altered.” In another\r\ninstance, the sign was adopted at Oxford as a quiet hint by a sharp\r\nbusiness man, who succeeded as landlord to an easy-going Boniface, under\r\nwhose sway the customers had been allowed to run up debts; but the case\r\nwas altered under the new regulations. A correspondent of _Notes and\r\nQueries_ (Nov. 21, 1857) gives the following example:--“I saw this sign\r\nonce pictorially represented in the West of England thus:--A person,\r\nwith a large wig and gown, and seated at a table; another, dressed like\r\na farmer, stood talking to him. In the distance, seen through the open\r\ndoor, was a bull. The story, of course, is that related of Plowden, the\r\ncelebrated lawyer,[653] and which is now in most books of fables. The\r\nfarmer told Plowden that his (the farmer’s) bull had gored and killed\r\nthe latter’s cow. ‘Well,’ said the lawyer, ‘the case is clear, you must\r\npay me her value.’ ‘Oh! but,’ said the farmer, ‘I have made a mistake.\r\nIt is _your_ bull which has killed my cow.’ ‘Ah! the case is altered,’\r\nquoth Plowden. The expression had passed into a proverb in Old Fuller’s\r\ntime.” This sign also occurs in some London localities, as at Upper\r\nKensal Green, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe GRINDING YOUNG is a very curious sign at Harold’s Cross, Dublin. The\r\nsubject is taken from the old ballad of the “Miller’s Maid Grinding Old\r\nMen Young,” commencing--\r\n\r\n  “Come, old, decrepit, lame, or blind,\r\n  Into my mill to take a grind.”\r\n\r\nIt is also a favourite subject on old chap-prints, which represent a\r\nkind of hand-mill, into the funnel-shaped top of which various\r\ndecrepit-looking old men creep by a ladder, most of them glass in hand,\r\ngreatly elated at the prospect of a renewal of youth. Meanwhile, a young\r\nmaid is turning the handle of the mill, from the bottom of which the\r\npatients come out, quite young and new--if not better--men. Pretty girls\r\nstand at the side, ready to receive the rejuvenated creatures and walk\r\noff with them, their arms affectionately twined round their necks, and\r\nevidently preparing to play the old game over again, for “the cordial\r\ndrop of life is love alone”--the whole affair a very decided improvement\r\nupon the usual way of entering the stage of this world.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar sign, though not quite so anacreontic, is of frequent\r\noccurrence in France, namely The FOUNTAIN OF JUVENCA,--_la Fontaine de\r\nJouvence_. A stone bas-relief of this subject, a carving of the\r\nsixteenth century, still remains in the Rue du Four, in Paris. The story\r\nwas borrowed by the French romancers from the Eastern tales.\r\n\r\nThe sign of the last house in a row on the outskirts of a town, used\r\nfrequently to be the WORLD’S END. This was represented in various\r\npunning ways; sometimes by a globe in clouds, as on the trades token of\r\nMargaret Tuttlesham, of Golden Lane, Barbican, in 1666. Others rendered\r\nit by a fractured globe in a dark background, with fire and smoke\r\nbursting through the rents, and thus it was represented at the World’s\r\nEnd in the King’s Road, Chelsea, in 1825. At Ecton, Northampton, it is\r\ntypified, with a truly classical notion of physical geography, by a\r\nhorseman whose steed is rearing over an abyss on the edge of a world\r\nterminated perpendicularly. A fourth, and more homely, way of\r\nrepresenting it was a man and a woman walking together on the margin of\r\na landscape, with this distich:\r\n\r\n  “I’ll go with my friend\r\n  To the world’s end.”\r\n\r\nThe out-of-the-way sites of such houses was the cause of their not\r\nenjoying the very best of reputations. Those, at least, of the World’s\r\nEnd at Chelsea and at Knightsbridge were rather exceptionable. Both\r\nthese houses were much patronised by the gallants of the reign of\r\nCharles II. when breaking the seventh commandment; hence the altercation\r\nbetween two sisters in Congreve’s play of “Love for Love:”\r\n\r\n  “_Mrs Foresight._ I suppose you would not go alone to the World’s End?\r\n\r\n  “_Mrs Frail._ The World’s End! What, do you mean to banter me?\r\n\r\n  “_Mrs Foresight._ Poor innocent; you don’t know that there is a place\r\n  called the World’s End. I’ll swear you can keep your\r\n  countenance--surely you’ll make an admirable player.\r\n\r\n  “_Mrs Frail._ I’ll swear you have a great deal of impudence, and in my\r\n  mind too much for the stage.\r\n\r\n  “_Mrs Foresight._ Very well, that will appear who has most. You never\r\n  were at the World’s End? eh.”\r\n\r\nPepys also honoured a World’s End, the “drinking-house by the Park,”\r\nwith an occasional visit. On Sunday, the 9th of May 1669, for instance,\r\nhe went to church at St Margaret’s, Westminster, and that duty\r\nperformed, walked “towards the park, but too soon to go in, so went on\r\nto Knightsbridge, and there eat and drank at the World’s End, _where we\r\nhad good things_, and then back to the park, and there till night, being\r\nfine weather and much company, and so home.” The “good things” evidently\r\nproved a strong attraction, for three weeks after he went again, “and\r\nthere was merry, and so home late.” In 1708 Tom Brown thus alluded to\r\nits equivocal reputation. “The lady must take a tour as far as\r\nKnightsbridge or Kensington, stop, maybe, at the World’s End or the\r\nSwan; offer my spark a small treat,” &c.[654] Under the name of _le Bout\r\ndu Monde_, the same sign was common in France, where in ancient Paris it\r\ngave a name to the street now called Rue du Cadran. With that inveterate\r\nweakness for punning inherent to sign-painters--those of the French\r\nnation in particular--it was sometimes represented by a he-goat (_bouc_)\r\nand a world.\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN is still common, being generally\r\nrepresented by a man walking at the south pole; in that guise it was to\r\nbe seen some twenty-five years ago on the Greenwich Road. But the\r\nmeaning of the sign is a state of things the opposite of what is natural\r\nand usual,--a conceit in which the artists of former ages took great\r\ndelight, and which they represented by animals chasing men, horses\r\nriding in carriages, and similar pleasantries. This also was a Dutch\r\nsign under the name of DE VERKEERDE WERELD, (_the world reversed_.) It\r\nwas used by a publican in the seventeenth century in Holland, with this\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n      “De wereld staat niet regt,\r\n      Voor de deur hangt hy verkeerd\r\n  ‘K Heb wyn en bier, en ’t geen gy meer begeert.”[655]\r\n\r\nOf the MOONRAKERS we only know one instance, that in Great Suffolk\r\nStreet, Borough, where it has been for at least half a century. The\r\noriginal of this may have been one of the stories of the Wise Men of\r\nGotham. A party of them going out one bright night, saw the reflection\r\nof the moon in the water; and, after due deliberation, decided that it\r\nwas a green cheese, and so raked for it. Another version is, that some\r\nGothamites, passing in the night over a bridge, saw from the parapet the\r\nmoon’s reflection in the river below, and took it for a green cheese.\r\nThey held a consultation as to the best means of securing it, when it\r\nwas resolved that one should hold fast to the parapet whilst the others\r\nhung from him, hand-in-hand, so as to form a chain to the water below,\r\nthe last man to seize the prize. When they were all in this position,\r\nthe uppermost, feeling the load heavy, and his hold giving way, called\r\nout, “Halloo! you below, hold tight while I take off my hand to spit on\r\nit!” The wise men below replied, “All right!” upon which he let go his\r\nhold, and they all dropped down into the water, and were drowned.\r\n\r\nA Moonraker is also the nickname for a native of Wiltshire, and a very\r\nsilly story is told there as its origin. Some Wiltshire smugglers, on\r\none of their nightly expeditions, being surprised by excisemen, were\r\ncompelled to hide a barrel of brandy in a pond, which one of the gang at\r\nthe first opportunity privately fished out for his own personal benefit.\r\nA few nights after, when the Argus eyes of the Excise were soundly\r\nclosed, the rest of the band availed themselves of a clear moonlight to\r\nreturn to the spot in order to “call the spirits from the vasty deep,”\r\nand began raking the water to their hearts’ content, for, taking the\r\nreflection of the moon to be the top of the barrel, they could not be\r\nconvinced that the “spirit was departed,” till morning came and showed\r\nthem that their barrel was all “moonshine.” Another version substitutes\r\nthieves and a cheese for the smugglers and the brandy barrel.\r\n\r\nThe CRADLE AND THE COFFIN, or FIRST AND LAST, was formerly a sign in\r\nNorwich, and one can still be seen on the South Quay, Yarmouth. This\r\ncombination may have its moral; not so the equally serious MORTAL MAN,\r\nin the little village of Troutbeck, near Ambleside, for there the\r\ndenomination is simply borrowed from the beginning of the inscription\r\nwhich has nothing of the _memento mori_ about it:--\r\n\r\n  “Thou mortal man that liv’st by bread,\r\n  What is it makes thy nose so red?”\r\n\r\n  “Thou silly elf with nose so pale,\r\n  It is with drinking Burkett’s ale.”\r\n\r\nThis imaginary dialogue is supposed to be held by the two figures on the\r\nsignboard, the one a poor miserable-looking object, the other, who\r\nindulged in Burkett’s ale, the chubby picture of health, with a nose\r\nlike that of Bardolph, “clothed in purple.” This sign was the work of\r\nIbbetson; the picture is now gone, but the verses remain.[656]\r\n\r\nAt Hedenham, on the road between Norwich and Bungay, there is a sign\r\ncalled TUMBLE-DOWN DICK, representing on one side Diogenes, on the\r\nother, a drunken man, with the following distich:\r\n\r\n  “Now Diogenes is dead and laid in his tomb,\r\n  Tumble-down Dick is come in his room.”\r\n\r\nAt Alton, in Hants, a drunken man is represented upsetting a table\r\ncovered with cups and glasses. The verses underneath this picture are\r\nthe same as at Hedenham, except that it is “Barnaby” who is said to be\r\ndefunct, and not Diogenes. At Woodton in Norfolk, another sign with this\r\nname represents a jolly old farmer in a red coat, with bottle and glass\r\nin his hand, falling off his chair in a state of _Bacchi plenus_. The\r\nearliest mention we find of the sign is in the _Original Weekly Journal_\r\nfor April 26--May 3, 1718, where a murder is reported to have been\r\ncommitted at the Tumbling-down Dick in Brentford. “Tumble-down Dick, in\r\nthe borough of Southwark,” says the _Adventurer_, No. 9, 1752, “is a\r\nfine moral on the instability of greatness, and the consequences of\r\nambition.” As such it was set up in derision of Richard Cromwell, the\r\nallusion to his fall from power, or “tumble down,” being very common in\r\nthe satires published after the Restoration, and amongst others,\r\nHudibras; thus, part iii., canto ii., 231:--\r\n\r\n  “Next him his son and heir apparent\r\n  Succeeded, though a lame viceregent,\r\n  Who first laid by the Parliament,\r\n  The only crutch on which he leant;\r\n  And then sunk underneath the state\r\n  That rode him above horseman’s weight.”\r\n\r\nThe same idea, and almost the identical words, occur again in his\r\n“Remains,” in the tale of the Cobbler and the Vicar of Bray:--\r\n\r\n  “What’s worse, old Noll is marching off,\r\n    And Dick, his heir apparent,\r\n  Succeeds him in the Government,\r\n    A very lame Vice-regent;\r\n  He’ll reign but little time, poor tool,\r\n    But sinks beneath the state,\r\n  That will not fail to ride the fool\r\n    ‘Bove common horseman’s weight.”\r\n\r\nWe meet it also in the ballad, “Old England is now a brave Barbary,”\r\n_i.e._ horse, from a “Collection of Loyal Songs,” reprinted in 1731,\r\nvol. ii., p. 231,--\r\n\r\n  “But _Nol_, a rank rider, gets first in the saddle,\r\n    And made her show tricks, and curvate, and rebound;\r\n  She quickly perceiv’d he rode widdle-waddle,\r\n    And like his coach-horses[657] threw his highness to ground.\r\n\r\n  “Then _Dick_, being lame, rode holding the pummel,\r\n    Not having the wit to get hold of the rein;\r\n  But the jade did so snort at the sight of a Cromwell,\r\n    That poor _Dick_ and his kindred turn’d footmen again.”\r\n\r\nDick’s bacchic propensities are also sung in many an old song. Two of\r\nthe Luttrell Ballads, vol. ii., pp. 11 and 36, allude to his weakness in\r\nthis respect:--\r\n\r\n  “Then thirdly Oliver he took place,\r\n  And set up young Dick the fool of his race;\r\n    _Dick loved a cup of nectar_.”\r\n\r\nIn another:--\r\n\r\n  “Drunken Dick was a lame Protector.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps to the same origin may be referred the sign of SOLDIER DICK,\r\nwhich occurs near Disley, Stockport; and HAPPY DICK, at Abingdon.\r\nTumbling-down Dick was also the name of a dance in the last century,\r\nwhich gives additional strength to the supposition that Dick Cromwell\r\nwas intended, since otherwise an ordinary signboard would scarcely have\r\ncome to such honour.\r\n\r\nThe JOLLY TOPER is a common public-house sign, probably put up as a good\r\nexample to the customers; in London, there is a TIPPLING PHILOSOPHER,\r\n“the right man in the right place,” for he “hangs out” in _Liquor Pond_\r\nStreet, opposite Reid’s great brewery. Here we have _l’embarras du\r\nchoix_; which philosopher was intended by the sign, for they all, more\r\nor less, “pleaded guilty to the soft impeachment.” Theophrastus, in his\r\n“Treaty on Drunkenness,” tells us that the seven sages of Greece often\r\nmet together to indulge in a cheerful glass. Plato not only excuses a\r\ndrop too much occasionally, but even orders it. Heraclitus, the weeping\r\nphilosopher, never laughed but when he was “half seas over.” Xenocrates\r\ngained a golden crown, awarded by Dionysius the tyrant to the deepest\r\ndrinker. Seneca states that Solon and Arcesilaus are believed to have\r\n“indulged in wine,” and Cornelius Gallus says that Socrates “carried off\r\nthe palm from his contemporaries by his drinking capacities.” Cato, we\r\nknow from various sources, liked his glass; Horace tells us--\r\n\r\n  “Narratur et prisci Catonis\r\n  Sæpe mero caluisse virtus;”[658]\r\n\r\nand Seneca says of him: “Cato vinum laxabat animum curis publicis\r\nfatigatum;”[659] elsewhere he remarks: “Catoni ebrietas objecta est, at\r\nfacilius efficiet quisquis qui objecerit honestum quam turpe\r\nCatoni.”[660] Seneca was certainly a biassed judge, for he says:\r\n“Habebitur aliquando ebrietas honor et plurimum meri cepisse virtus\r\nerit.”[661] Other tippling philosophers are enumerated in the following\r\nquaint Latin verses, the author of which is not known:--\r\n\r\n  “Tunc vix Democritus poterat compescere risum,\r\n    Riderent cum sibi vina labris.\r\n  Tergeret ut fletus contrarius alter amaros,\r\n    Sugebat lacrymas saepe, lagena, tuas.\r\n  Divinum ut Bacchi semper spiraret odorem,\r\n    Diogenes medii vixit in orbe cadi.\r\n  Dicitur ardentem cum sese misit in Æthnam,\r\n    Empedocles modico non caluisse mero.\r\n  Teque ferunt veteres guttas, Epicure, Lyæi\r\n    Vel minimas atomis antetulisse tuis.\r\n  Talia ne dubiter potare exempla secutus,\r\n    Qui sapit ille bibit, qui bibit ergo sapit.”[662]\r\n\r\nIn Holland they have a curious practice, which the _Spectator_ thus\r\ndescribes:--\r\n\r\n  “The Dutch who are more famous for their industry than for their wit\r\n  and humour, hang up in several of their streets what they call the\r\n  sign of the GAPER; that is, the head of an idiot dressed in a cap and\r\n  bells and gaping in a most immoderate manner; this is a standing jest\r\n  in Amsterdam.”\r\n\r\nBut the statement is slightly--probably wilfully--incorrect. Carved\r\nwooden busts of Gapers are still used at the present day in Holland, but\r\nare, and have always been, chemists’, or rather, druggists’ signs, to\r\nintimate that narcotics are sold within, as gaping or yawning is a\r\nprecursor of sleep. The costume of these busts is generally somewhat\r\nOriental, as Eastern nations were supposed to be not only expert in\r\nherbs and medicines, but also, because opium came from Eastern climes.\r\n\r\nA very curious and rare sign is to be seen in the little village of\r\nNidd, near Knaresborough; this is the ASS IN THE BAND-BOX. We find it\r\nmentioned in 1712 in Partridge’s MS. book of “Celestial Motions.”[663]\r\nIn the month of October of that year he entered the following\r\nmemorandum:--“At the end of this month the villains made the Band-box\r\nplot, to blow up Robin and his family with a couple of inkhorns, and\r\nthat rogue Swift was at the opening of the band-box and the discovery of\r\nthe plot. The truth of it all was: ‘---- in a Band-box.’”[664] It\r\nfigured also as one of the signs in Bonnel Thornton’s signboard\r\nexhibition of 1762.[665] It seems to have originated from an extremely\r\nindelicate joke called “selling bargains,” with which the maids of\r\nhonour amused themselves in Swift’s time, (see his “Polite\r\nConversation;”) unless it be a vernacular reading of some crest, such as\r\nan antelope or a unicorn issuing out of a mural crown.\r\n\r\nIn the borough of Southwark is a sign on which is inscribed “The OLD\r\nPICK-MY-TOE,” which, in the absence of any better origin, we may suppose\r\nto be a vulgar representation of the Roman slave who, being sent on some\r\nmessage of importance, would not stop to pick a thorn out of his foot,\r\nuntil he had completed his mission. Probably this was the same sign as\r\nthat represented on the trades token of Samuel Bovery in George Lane, a\r\nnaked figure picking one of its feet; but the name of the house is not\r\ngiven on the token. JACK OF BOTH SIDES, at Reading, is so named because\r\nthe house stands at a point where two roads meet in the form of a Y, and\r\nthe house being wedge-shaped, has an entry at each side. Such a house in\r\nLondon is often called by the vulgar a “Flat-iron.”\r\n\r\nThe OLD SMUGS is a sign on the trades token of Joseph Hall, at Newington\r\nButts, 1667, representing a smith and an anvil; but whether John Hall\r\nhimself was “old Smvgs,” or whether he kept a tavern frequented by\r\nblacksmiths, history does not inform us. This last is also the name of\r\none of the characters in the “Merry Devil at Edmonton.” The BATTERED\r\nNAGGIN (_sic_ for Noggin) is an Irish sign, it being in that country a\r\nfigurative expression for a man who has got more than is good for\r\nhim,--“he has got a lick of a battered naggin.” The NOGGIN, without the\r\nadjective, occurs at a few places in Lancashire and Yorkshire. The\r\nTUMBLING SAILORS, representing three seamen “half-seas-over,” and\r\nreeling arm-in-arm down a street, may be seen near Broseley, at Dudley,\r\nand in other places. The CRIPPLE’S INN at Stockingford, Warwick, is\r\ndoubtless nothing more than a very “lame” attempt at comicality. The HAT\r\nIN HAND, in Portsea, promises a polite host; but what can be expected of\r\nOLD CARELESS, the ominous name of a public-house at Stapleford, Notts,\r\nof SPITE HALL at Brandon, Durham, or of OLD NO, which occurs in Silver\r\nStreet, Sheffield? SLOW AND EASY is the unpromising name of an ale-house\r\nat Lostock, Chester; let us hope that it may be meant for a version of\r\nthe Italian proverb, “_chi va piano va sano_,” meaning that the landlord\r\nwill be content with small and fair profits, and acquire fortune by slow\r\nand easy steps.\r\n\r\n[627] The “goose’s foot” she obtained was most probably that at the\r\ncorner of her eye--_i.e._, she became an old woman--for the French call\r\n_patte d’oie_--goose’s foot--that first attack of time upon beauty which\r\nwe term the crow’s foot.\r\n\r\n[628] A whetstone was anciently the name given in derision to a liar.\r\nThe reason of it is explained in the following rhymes under an old\r\nengraving in the Bridgewater collection, representing a man with a\r\nwhetstone in his hand:--\r\n\r\n  “The whettstone is a man that all men know,\r\n  Yet many on him doe much cost bestowe:\r\n  Hee’s us’d almost in every shoppe, but why?\r\n  An edge must needs be set on every lye.”\r\n\r\nHow old is this connexion between lies and whetstones may be seen from\r\nStow:--“Of the like counterfeit physition have I noted (in the Summarie\r\nof my Chronicles, anno 1382,) to be set on horsebacke, his face to the\r\nhorsetaile, the same taile in his hand as a bridle, a collar of jordans\r\nabout his necke, _a whetstone on his breast_, and so led through the\r\ncitie of London with ringing of basons, and banished.”--_Stow’s\r\nChronicle_, Howe’s edition, 1614, p. 604. It is a curious coincidence\r\nthat in France and Germany a knife--the Rodomont knife--was handed over\r\nto outrageous liars. A vestige of this custom was still preserved at the\r\nuniversity of Bonn at the end of the last century, where, when one of\r\nthe company at the students’ mess drew the long bow a little too\r\nstrongly, it was customary for all who sat at the table, without making\r\nany remarks, to lay their dinner knives on the top of their glasses, all\r\npointing towards the offender.\r\n\r\n[629] _London Gazette_, Dec. 23-26, 1700.\r\n\r\n[630] _Ibid._, Jan. 10-14, 1678.\r\n\r\n[631] James Christopher le Blond, a Fleming by birth, obiit 1740, made\r\npreparations to copy the Hampton Court tapestry cartoons.

Another [Heraclius] on\r\nthe contrary, often drank thy tears, O bottle, in order to dry his own\r\ntears. Diogenes lived in a barrel so that he might always smell the\r\nodour of divine wine. It is said that Empedocles, when he jumped down\r\nburning Etna, had first warmed himself with no small quantity of wine.\r\nThey also say that thou, O Epicurus, didst prefer even the smallest\r\ndrops of old wine to thine atoms. In imitation of these examples, I do\r\nnot hesitate in drinking, for he who tastes drinks, consequently he that\r\ndrinks is wise.” It is almost impossible to translate this last line, on\r\naccount of the pun contained in the verb _sapere_, which at the same\r\ntime means “to taste” and “to be wise.” The second line is evidently\r\nimperfect.\r\n\r\n[663] Harl. MSS., 6200, p. 68.\r\n\r\n[664] This alludes to the well-known plot of a bandbox sent to the Lord\r\nTreasurer, containing a very poor infernal machine, made of inkhorns.\r\nThe affair, however, has never been satisfactorily cleared up. Swift is\r\ncalled a rogue by the indignant Partridge, because he had made a droll\r\nballad and epitaph upon the “Supposed death of Partridge, the\r\nAlmanac-maker,” which Swift had predicted and Partridge publicly denied.\r\n\r\n[665] See Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nPUNS AND REBUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPunning on names, or a figurative rendering of names, was probably at\r\nfirst adopted not so much with any intent at joking, as means to assist\r\nthe memory, giving the name a visible token, which would take the place\r\nof writing at a time when but few persons could either read or write. At\r\nthe revival of learning, and the spread of what we may term the\r\nrefinement of society, punning was one of the few accomplishments at\r\nwhich the fine ladies and gentlemen aimed. From the twelfth to the\r\nsixteenth century, it was at its greatest height. The conversation of\r\nthe witty gallants and ladies, and even of the clowns and other inferior\r\ncharacters, in the comedies of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, which\r\nwe may be sure was painted from the life, is full of puns and plays upon\r\nwords. The unavoidable result of such an excess was a surfeit, and the\r\nconsequent _dégout_, which lasted for more than a century.[666] Like\r\nother diseases, it broke out again subsequently with redoubled\r\nvirulence, and made great havoc in the reign of Queen Anne. “Several\r\nworthy gentlemen and critics,” says the _Tatler_ for June 23, 1709,\r\n“have applied to me to give my censure of an enormity, which has been\r\nrevived after being long suppressed, and is called Punning. I have\r\nseveral arguments ready to prove that he cannot be a man of honour who\r\nis guilty of this abuse of human society.”\r\n\r\nBagford makes the following remark on this subject:--\r\n\r\n  “As for rebuses or name devices, thei ware brought into use heare in\r\n  England after King Edward ye 3 had conquered France, and this was\r\n  taken up by most people heare in this nation, espesially by them which\r\n  had none armes; and if their names ended in _ton_, as Haton; Boulton;\r\n  Luton; Grafton; Middellton; Seton; Norton; they must presently have\r\n  for their signes or devises a hat and a tun; a boult and a tun; a lute\r\n  and a tun, and so on, which signifies nothing to ye name, for all\r\n  names ending in _Ton_ signifieth a toune from whence they tooke their\r\n  name. It would make one very merry to loke ouer ye learned Camden in\r\n  his ‘Remaines,’ and to consider ye titles of our ould books printed by\r\n  Haryson, Kingston, Islip, Woodcooke, Payer, Bushell,” &c.--_Harl.\r\n  MSS._, 5910, p. ii.\r\n\r\nCamden, in his “Remains,” mentions these punning signs, and gives a like\r\nstatement with Bagford, that they were introduced from France, where\r\nthey are still much in fashion. “These,” says Camden, “were so well\r\nliked by our English there and, sent hither ouer the streight of Calice\r\nwith full sayle, were so entertained here although they were most\r\nridiculous, by all degrees of the learned and unlearned, that he was\r\nnobody that could not hammer out of his name an invention by this\r\nwitcraft, and picture it accordingly: whereupon who did not busy his\r\nbrain to hammer his device out of this forge.” After many examples too\r\nlong to quote, he concludes with the following:--\r\n\r\n  “Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury, a man of great wisedome, and borne\r\n  to the universall good of this realme, was content to use _mor_ upon a\r\n  ton, and sometimes a mulberry-tree, called _Morus_ in Latine, out of a\r\n  ton. So _Luton_, _Thornton_, _Ashton_, did note their names with a\r\n  Lute, a Thorn, and an Ash upon a Ton. So an hare on a bottle for\r\n  _Harebottle_, a Maggot-pie upon a Goat for _Pigot_. _Med_ written on a\r\n  Calf for _Medcalfe_; _Chester_, a chest with a starre over it;\r\n  _Allet_, a Lot; _Lionel Ducket_, a Lion with L on his head, where it\r\n  should have beene in his tayle; if the lion had been eating a ducke it\r\n  had been a rare device,--worth a Duckat or a duck-egge. And if you\r\n  require more, I refer you to the wittie inventions of some Londoners;\r\n  but that for Garret Dewes is most memorable: two in a garret casting\r\n  dews at dice.[667] This for rebus may suffice, and yet if there were\r\n  more, I think some lips would like such kind of Lettice.”[668]\r\n\r\nHow punning signboards were concocted we may gather from a scene in Ben\r\nJonson’s “Alchymist,” act ii., scene 1, where a rebus sign is to be\r\nfound for Abel Drugger, who for that purpose goes to a kind of\r\nfortune-teller, styling himself an alchymist, and who provides our\r\nshopkeeper in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n  “He shall have a _bell_, that’s Abel,\r\n  And by it standing one whose name is _Dee_\r\n  In a _rug_ gown, there’s _D_ and _rug_, that’s _drug_,\r\n  And right anenst him a dog snarling _er_,\r\n  There’s _Drugger_, Abel Drugger. That’s his sign,\r\n  And here’s no mystery and hieroglyphic.”\r\n\r\nThis wonderful sign the Alchymist terms a “mystic character,” the\r\n“radii” of which are to produce no end of good results to Abel’s trade.\r\n\r\nThe Cockneys (“gentle dulness dearly loves a joke”) have at all times\r\nbeen celebrated for this kind of pleasantry. The mention of a few of\r\ntheir signs will be sufficient to show the extent of their wit and\r\noriginality in this direction. The well-known bird-bolt through a tun,\r\nor BOLT IN TUN, for Bolton, the device of one of the priors of St\r\nBartholomew, is still in existence in Fleet Street.\r\n\r\n  “It may seem doubtful,” says Camden, “whether Bolton, prior of St\r\n  Bartholomew, in Smithfield, was wiser when he invented for his name a\r\n  bird-bolt through his Tun, or when he built him a house upon Harrow\r\n  Hill, for fear of an inundation after a great conjunction of planets\r\n  in the watery triplicity.”\r\n\r\nFrom an entry in the Patent Roll of 21 Henry VI., (1443,) this house in\r\nFleet Street appears to have been an inn at that period. In a licence of\r\nalienation to the Friars Carmelites of London, of certain premises in\r\nthe parish of St Dunstan, Fleet Street, “_Hospitium vocatum le\r\nBoltenton_” is mentioned as a boundary. On some of the seventeenth\r\ncentury trades tokens, we meet with a tun pierced by three arrows; this\r\nvariation of the Bolt in Tun was called the TUN AND ARROWS, (or\r\n_h_arrows, as the Cockney tokens have it.) There was one in Bishopsgate\r\nStreet Within, and another in Bishopsgate Street Without, in the reign\r\nof Charles II.\r\n\r\nA HAND AND COCK was the punning sign of John Hancock, in Whitefriars.\r\nGeorge Cox, in the Minories, tallow-chandler by trade, had TWO COCKS for\r\nhis sign. Thomas Cockayne, a distiller in Southwark, had the same sign,\r\nas a feeble pun on part of his name; whilst Christopher Bostock, not\r\nseeing any possibility “to hammer” a rebus out of his own patronym,\r\nfortunately for him lived at Cock’s Key, and so could make up for this\r\nmisfortune by punning on the name of that place, whence his sign\r\ntriumphantly exhibited the COCK AND KEY. John Drinkwater, a publisher,\r\nintimated his name by a FOUNTAIN; and William Woodcock, a bookseller in\r\nSt Paul’s Churchyard in the seventeenth century, happily rendered his by\r\na cock standing on a bundle of wood. William Hill, another bookseller in\r\nSt Paul’s Churchyard in 1598, lived at the sign of the HILL. John\r\nBuckland, who followed the same profession in Paternoster Row, in 1750,\r\nwas modestly content with half a pun, and adopted the sign of the BUCK,\r\nwhile, in the same manner, another of his colleagues, Samuel Manship,\r\nwho in 1720 lived “against the Royal Exchange, Cornhill,” was satisfied\r\nwith the SHIP. The SUN AND RED CROSS, in Jewin Street, was the sign of\r\nJohn Cross, who, taking a house with the sign of the _Sun_, added to it\r\na _Cross_. In the same manner Pelham More, in _Moors_gate, had the SUN\r\nAND MOOR’S HEAD. John Cherry, of Maidenhead, adopted a CHERRY-TREE as\r\nhis sign, showing in this as much wit as the ancestor of the Crequi\r\nfamily in France, who chose a _Crequier_ (old French for cherry-tree) as\r\nhis coat of arms. Hugh Conny, of Caxton and Elsworth, Cambridge, had in\r\n1666 THREE CONIES, or rabbits, for a sign. Richard Lion, in the Strand,\r\nhad the LION. Bartholomew Fish, at Queenhithe, in 1667, THREE FISHES.\r\nWilliam Horne, in Oak Lane, 1671, the HORNS. Thomas Fox, in Newgate\r\nMarket, a FOX. William Geese, King Street, Westminster, THREE GEESE.\r\nEllinor Gandor, Upper Shadwell, 1667, a GANDER; whilst H. Goes, a native\r\nof Antwerp, printer at York in 1506, next at Beverley, and finally, in\r\nLondon, had for his sign a GOOSE with an H above it. Joseph Parsons, “at\r\nthe sign of PARSON’S GREEN,” Market Place, St James, seems to have had a\r\nview of Parson’s Green, Fulham, for his sign; though why he did not\r\nsimply take a parson is, we fear, a secret he has carried with him to\r\nthe grave. John Hive, St Mary’s Hill, 1667, had the sign of the BEEHIVE.\r\nGrace Pestell, in Fig-tree Yard, Ratcliffe, the PESTLE AND MORTAR. John\r\nAtwood, in Rose Lane, the MAN IN THE WOOD. Andrew Hind, over against the\r\nMews, Charing Cross, a HIND. Taylor, the Water poet, mentions a similar\r\nsign at Preston:--\r\n\r\n  “There at the Hinde, kinde Master Hinde, mine host,\r\n  Kept a good table, bak’d, and boyld, and rost.”[669]\r\n\r\nJane Keye, Bloomsbury Market, 1653, a KEY. The LION AND KEY was, in\r\n1651, a sign in Thames Street, punning perhaps on the neighbouring\r\nLion’s Quay; it is still the sign of a public-house in Hull, whilst the\r\nRED LION AND KEY still occurs in Mill Lane, Tooley Street. A grocer,\r\nnamed Laurence Green, proved that to the “_fortem ac tenacem propositi\r\nvirum_” nothing is impossible, and found means to pun upon his\r\nuntractable name by painting his doorposts _green_, and called his shop\r\nthe GREEN POSTS. We meet with him in a newspaper advertisement, which,\r\nas it gives the price of various articles at that date, is not\r\nuninteresting. Green sold--\r\n\r\n  “Chocolate, made of the best nuts, at 3s. a pound; the best, with\r\n  sugar, at 2s. a pound; a good sort of all nut, at 2s. 6d.; with sugar,\r\n  1s. 8d. To the buyers of three pounds, a quarter gratis. The best\r\n  coffee, at 5s. 4d. a pound; to the buyer of three pounds, 1s. allowed.\r\n  Bohee tea, at 16, 20, 24s., the very finest, at 28s. a pound. Fine\r\n  green tea, at 14s., good, at 10s. a pound. Fine Spanish snuff, at 4s.\r\n  a pound.” &c.[670]\r\n\r\nThe HARP was the sign of Richard Harper, West Smithfield; it occurs on a\r\ntrades token. The house seems afterwards to have assumed the sign of the\r\nBIBLE AND HARP. What occupation Richard Harper followed does not appear\r\nfrom his token, but in 1641 a Richard Harper at the sign of the Bible\r\nand Harp, published a tract called\r\n\r\n              “BARTHOLOMEW FAYRE,\r\n                      or\r\n  Varieties of Fancies where you may find,\r\n  A fayre of Wares and all to please your mind.”\r\n\r\nIn 1670 the house was occupied by a certain J. Clarke, and at a\r\nsubsequent period by J. Bisset; both these men published numerous\r\nballads.\r\n\r\nThe HAT AND TUN is a pun on the name of Hatton, and is still preserved\r\non a public-house sign in Hatton Wall. A man named Nobis, at the\r\nbeginning of the present century opened an inn on the road to\r\nPappenburgh, which he called NOBIS INN, and made free with grammar in\r\norder to find a punning motto, viz.: “SI DEUS PRO NOBIS QUIS CONTRA\r\nNOBIS.” BELLS have been used by innumerable persons of the name of Bell.\r\nThe SALMON was the sign of Mrs Salmon, the Madame Tussaud of the\r\neighteenth century; her gallery was first in St Martin’s-le-Grand, near\r\nAldersgate, whence she removed to Fleet Street, opposite what is now\r\nAnderton’s Hotel, then called the Horns Tavern. The BRACE Tavern, in\r\nQueen’s Bench prison, was so called on account of its being kept by two\r\nbrothers of the name of _Partridge_. The GOLDEN HEART was the sign of\r\nThomas Hart, a tailor in Monmouth Street, St Giles. (Harl. MSS., Bagford\r\nBills, 5931.) Bat Pidgeon, the hairdresser immortalised in the\r\n_Spectator_, lived at the THREE PIGEONS, “the corner house of St\r\nClement’s churchyard, next to the Strand,” says Pennant, where he “cut\r\nmy boyish locks in the year 1740.”\r\n\r\nThe BLACK SWAN in Bartholomew Lane, nicknamed Cobweb Hall, was kept by\r\nOwen Swan, parish clerk (hence the _Black_ Swan?) of St Michael’s,\r\nCornhill. It was a tavern of great resort for the musical wits in the\r\nseventeenth century. Failing in this business, Owen set up as a\r\ntobacconist in St Michael’s Alley; on the papers in which he wrapped\r\ntobacco for his customers, were the following rhymes:--\r\n\r\n  “The dying Swan in sad and mourning strains\r\n  Of his near end and hapless fate complains,\r\n  In pity then your kind assistance give,\r\n  Smoke of Swan’s best that the poor bird may live.”\r\n\r\nTo which a friend of his wrote the following reply:--\r\n\r\n  “The aged Swan opprest with time and cares,\r\n  With Indian sweets his funeral prepares.\r\n  Light up the pile! thus he’ll ascend the skies\r\n  And Phœnix-like from his own ashes rise.”\r\n\r\nThere is a well-known anecdote of a man named Farr, who opened a tobacco\r\nshop on Fish Street Hill, and soon obtained a good custom from the pun\r\nover his door, “The best tobacco _by Farr_,” rather than from the\r\nquality of his tobacco. Opposite him there was another tobacconist who\r\nlost his customers through his pun, but he regained them in the same way\r\nas he lost them, for he fought Farr with his own weapons, and wrote up\r\n“_Far_ better tobacco than the best tobacco _by Farr_.” This joke was\r\nthought so good that all his customers returned. Tobacco-papers of the\r\noriginal “finest tobacco _by Farr_” are preserved among the Banks\r\nhand-bills in the British Museum, as a proof of the truth of this\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nA LING, or codfish, strange to say, entwined with honeysuckles, was the\r\nsign of Nicholas Ling, at the north-west door of St Paul’s, where, in\r\n1595, he published “Pierce Pennylesse his Supplicacion to the Divell.”\r\nAn OAK was the sign of Nicholas Okes, a bookseller dwelling at Gray’s\r\nInn, publisher of some of Taylor the Water Poet’s works. His colophon\r\nrepresents Jupiter seated on an eagle between two oak trees. A French\r\npublisher, Nicholas Cheneau, in the Rue St Jacques, Paris, in 1580, had\r\nalso an oak for his sign, (_chêne_, an oak.)\r\n\r\nJohn Day, another publisher of the time of Queen Elizabeth, had a sort\r\nof pun, or charade, on his name in the sign of the RESURRECTION, his\r\ndevice representing a man waking a sleeper, with the words, “Arise, for\r\nit is _day_.” The Castle and Falcon was another of his signs. Richard\r\nGrafton, the first printer of the Common Prayer, who also printed the\r\nproclamation of Lady Jane Grey as Queen of England, for which he fell\r\nunder the displeasure of Queen Mary, had a tun with a grafted fruit-tree\r\ngrowing through it. Stow made a pun upon this sign, saying that one of\r\nGrafton’s works was “a noise of empty _tonnes_ and unfruitful\r\n_grafftes_,” to which Grafton retaliated by calling Stow’s Chronicle “a\r\ncollection of lyes foolishly _stowed_ together.” Hugh Singleton had a\r\nGOLDEN TUN; Harrison, 1560, a hare sheltering under a corn-sheaf tied\r\nwith a ribbon, and with the letters _ri_ and a sun shining above; but\r\nthe most absurd rebus of all was that of one Newberry, who, according to\r\nCamden, had a YEW TREE with several berries upon it, and in the midst a\r\ngreat golden N upon one of the branches, which by the help of a little\r\nfalse spelling made N-yew-berry.\r\n\r\nA few punning signs still remain. At Oswaldstwistle, near Accrington, a\r\nman named Bellthorn has the BELL IN THE THORN; at Warbleton, in Sussex,\r\nan old public-house has the sign of a war-bill in a tun, which sign of\r\nthe AXE AND TUN is further intended as an intimation to “axe for beer”!\r\nAnother innkeeper named Abraham Lowe, who lives half way up Richmond\r\nHill, near Douglas in the Isle of Man, has the following innocent\r\nattempt at punning on his name:--\r\n\r\n  “I’m Abraham Lowe, and half way up the Hill,\r\n  If I were higher up, what’s funnier still,\r\n  I should be _lowe_. Come in and take your fill,\r\n  Of porter, ale, wine, spirits, what you will,\r\n  Step in, my friend, I pray, no farther go;\r\n  My prices, like myself, are always low.”\r\n\r\nBesides rebuses, and puns on names, the French have another class of\r\npunning signs, for which we have only very few equivalents, namely,\r\nrebus signboards. One of the most common is the BŒUF À LA MODE, which\r\nsome twenty or thirty years ago was thus Englished in golden letters on\r\na low boarding-house at Brussels:--\r\n\r\n  “_The Board House of the Fashionable Beef._”\r\n\r\nIt is the usual sign for eating-houses, being the standard dish of the\r\nFrench _bourgeoisie_. The picture represents an ox dressed up in the\r\nheight of female elegance, with bonnet, shawl, &c. A good repartee is\r\ntold, originating in this method of representing the sign: a citizen’s\r\nwife, of aldermanic proportions, was coming out of a _magasin de\r\nnouveautés_ in Paris, just as two “social evils” were going in;\r\n“_Dis-donc, Pelagie_,” said one of the girls to her companion, “look at\r\nthat Bœuf-à-la-Mode who is going out.” “Yes,” replied the indignant\r\nmatron, who had overheard the remark, “and now _game_ is coming in!”\r\n\r\nOther French punning signs, such as ST JEAN BAPTISTE, _Au Juste Prix_,\r\nLE BOUT DU MONDE, LE SIGNE DE LA CROIX, and many more, have been noticed\r\nin former chapters, and need not, therefore, be again mentioned here.\r\n\r\n[666] In the old sermons and religious treatises of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, however, we occasionally find punning resorted to by the\r\npreachers of the time.\r\n\r\n[667] He was a printer who kept his shop at the sign of the Swan in St\r\nPaul’s Churchyard in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. This Garatt D’Ewes\r\nwas grandfather of the celebrated antiquary, Sir Symond D’Ewes; he\r\namassed a handsome fortune, which enabled him to purchase the manor of\r\nGains near Upminster, Essex, and thus laid the foundation of the future\r\ngreatness of his family. D’Ewes was of Dutch origin, being a native of\r\nthe province of Gelderland. Some of the letters of this early printer\r\nare preserved in the Harl. MS., No. 381.\r\n\r\n[668] Camden’s Remains, p. 140, _et seq._ 1629.\r\n\r\n[669] Taylor’s Pennylesse Pilgrimage, 1630.\r\n\r\n[670] _Postman_, January 25-27, 1711.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS SIGNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSigns which could not well be classed under any of the former divisions\r\nwill find their place in this chapter, and hence a motley gathering may\r\nbe expected. As in all inquiries it is proper to begin with the\r\na. b. c., we shall do so here. The A. B. C. was the sign of Richard\r\nFawkes, a bookseller, as the imprint of his works says:--\r\n\r\n  “In the suburbss of the famous Cytye of Lōdon, withoute Templebarre\r\n  dwellynge in Durresme rentes [part of Durham House, where now the\r\n  Adelphi stands] or else in Powles churche-yerde at the sygne of the\r\n  A. B. C. The year of our Lorde MCCCCCXXX.”\r\n\r\nThis, we must admit, was a very reasonable sign for a “man of letters.”\r\nContinental booksellers also employed it; amongst others, Jacob Pietersz\r\nPaetsy, of Amsterdam, in 1597; in the Hague such a sign gave its name to\r\na street. About 1825 there was a public-house in Clare Market called the\r\nA. B. C., where the alphabet from A to Z was painted over the door. Even\r\nat the present day many public-houses are called the LETTERS; thus there\r\nare two in Shrewsbury, two in Carlisle, one in Oldham, and others in\r\nvarious places. GRAND A is a public-house near East Dereham, Norfolk.\r\nLITTLE A was the sign of a tobacconist in Leadenhall Street, _circa_\r\n1780; his tobacco-papers, preserved among the Banks bills, were adorned\r\nwith a portrait of “Sir Jeffrey Dunstan, or Old Wigs,” one of the mayors\r\nof Garrat, styled “Old Wigs” from his practice of buying those articles,\r\nby which he made an honourable living before ambition flamed his soul\r\nand he entered upon a political career. GRAND B may be seen at Long\r\nFramlington, Morpeth; Q INN at Staleybridge; and Q IN THE CORNER in\r\nSheffield. Rhyming alphabets and nursery rhymes present us with the\r\nfirst and last, but the second we confess is somewhat mysterious: the\r\n_Crowned Q_, (au Q COURRONNE,) which was an old sign in the Rue de la\r\nFerronière, Paris, is easy enough to understand, and one of those broad\r\nRabelaisian strokes of humour which the public delighted in a century or\r\ntwo ago; indeed the sign continued in its old quarters until 1828. The Y\r\nwas formerly a mercer’s sign in France, and may have originated from the\r\ncustom of tying ribbons up in festoons, when they would assume somewhat\r\nthe shape of that letter. It was also the sign of Nicholas Duchemin, a\r\nbookseller in Paris, 1541-1576. He, however, took a Pythagorean view of\r\nthis letter, and considered it, as the freemasons do, an emblem of the\r\ndouble path of life, the broad way leading to destruction, the narrow\r\nway unto life; hence the top of the left hand branch terminated in\r\nflames, the right hand in a crown. The idea was evidently borrowed from\r\nMatt. vii. 13, unless it be from Persius, who says--\r\n\r\n  “Et tibi quæ Samios deduxit litera ramos,\r\n  Surgentem dextro monstravit limite callem.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nZ was formerly a grocer’s sign in this country, and was said to stand\r\nfor Zinzibar, (ginger,) but this Z after all was perhaps only a\r\ncorruption of the figure 4 which, we are informed, is or was a constant\r\ngrocer’s sign in some parts of Scotland, as for instance in Stirling,\r\nimplying that their provisions came from the four quarters of the world.\r\nNUMBER IV is still the sign of an ale-house at 74 Hope Street, Salford,\r\nManchester. NUMBER THREE is to be seen at Great Layton, near Blackpool.\r\nIn 1633 it was the sign of a bookseller, Jean Brunet, in the Rue Neuve\r\nS. Louis, Paris. He says on the imprints of his books, _au Trois de\r\nchiffres_, in contradistinction to the Roman numerals, which at that\r\ntime were not named _chiffres_ but _nombres_; chiffres applied only to\r\nthe Arab numerals. The latter were introduced by Pope Silvester II.\r\n(999-1003) who, having studied at Seville, acquired them from the Moors.\r\n\r\nThe BELL is one of the commonest signs in England, and was used as early\r\nas the fourteenth century, for Chaucer says that the “gentil hostelrie\r\nthat heighte the Tabard,” was “faste by the Belle.” Most probably bells\r\nwere set up as signs on account of our national fondness for\r\nbell-ringing, which procured for our island the name of the “ringing\r\nisland,” and made Handel say, that the bell was our national musical\r\ninstrument; and long may it be so! We confess to have derived infinitely\r\nmore pleasurable feelings from hearing the melodious bells on a summer\r\nafternoon ringing through the clear air and sending their sweet sounds\r\nover corn-field and meadow, over brook and stream, than from any\r\ncavatina or cantata, sung by the dearest paid Italians in crowded\r\noperas, and at over-heated concerts. Paul Hentzner, a German traveller,\r\nwho visited this country in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, says, “the\r\nEnglish are vastly fond of noises that fill the air, such as firing of\r\ncannon, beating of drums, and _ringing of bells_; so that it is common\r\nfor a number of them to go up into some belfry, and ring bells for hours\r\ntogether for the sake of exercise.” Aubrey makes a similar remark; and,\r\nfor further reference, we may go to Sir Symonds D’Ewes, who writes in\r\nhis “Memoirs,” that, in 1618, he was ringing the large bell of St John’s\r\nCollege, Cambridge, for exercise, when the great comet was in the\r\nheavens; the consequence was, that he got entangled in the ropes, and\r\nnearly fractured his skull, whereupon he wisely resolved not to ring so\r\nlong as the mischievous comet was to be seen. Generally, for a merry\r\npeal, the different toned octave bells are rung in succession; then\r\nchanges are introduced, which, by continually altering, the succession\r\nof the bells produces a most pleasing effect. A peal of bells usually\r\nconsists of eight, hence the frequency of the EIGHT BELLS; besides\r\nthese, there are the FOUR BELLS, the FIVE BELLS, the SIX BELLS, the TEN\r\nBELLS; the EIGHT RINGERS, (Norwich and elsewhere,) the OLD RING O’\r\nBELLS, Wolverhampton, Birmingham, &c. THREE SWANS AND PEAL, Walsall,\r\nStaffordshire; the NELSON AND PEAL, also in Warwickshire, and many\r\nothers mentioned in a previous chapter. In some old belfries, the rules\r\nand fines of the ringers are painted in rhymes on the walls; as for\r\ninstance, in St John’s Church, Chester, (dated 1687,) in All Saints’\r\nChurch, Hastings, (dated 1756,) &c. One of the oldest BELL taverns in\r\nMiddlesex stood in King Street, Westminster; it is named in the expenses\r\nof Sir John Howard, (Jockey of Norfolk,) in 1466. Pepys dined at this\r\nhouse, July 1, 1660, invited by purser Washington; but came away greatly\r\ndisgusted, for, says he, “the rogue had no more manners than to invite\r\nme, and let me pay my club.” In November of the same year, he was there\r\nagain, “to see the 7 flanders mares that my Lord has bought lately.” In\r\nQueen Anne’s reign, the October club, consisting of about one hundred\r\nand fifty county members of Parliament, all unmitigated Tories, used to\r\nmeet at this tavern. The BELL, in Warwick Lane, Newgate Street, is\r\nanother example of the old London coaching inns, still in its original\r\ncondition, the galleries being propped up to prevent their falling down:\r\neverything about the place has a seventeenth century look,--the country\r\ncarts, the chickens here in the very heart of the city, the inn kitchen\r\nwith its old black clock, its settles and white benches, the very smell\r\nof the cookery going on seems more homely and old English than the hot\r\ngreasy vapours emanating from the areas of modern taverns. Coming into\r\nthis yard from the adjacent crowded streets, is like entering a\r\nlatter-day Pompeii. It was at this inn that Archbishop Leighton, the\r\nhonest, steady advocate of peace and forbearance, died in 1684.\r\n\r\n  “He often used to say that if he were to choose a place to die in, it\r\n  should be an Inn; it looks like a pilgrim’s going home, to whom this\r\n  world was all as an Inn, and who was weary of the noise and confusion\r\n  in it. He added, that the officious tenderness and care of friends was\r\n  an entanglement to a dying man; and that the unconcerned attendance of\r\n  those that could be procured in such a place would give less\r\n  disturbance. And he obtained what he desired.”[671]\r\n\r\nAt the BELL, in the Poultry, lived, in the reign of King William and\r\nQueen Anne, Nathaniel Crouch, the famous bookseller, who was the first\r\nto condense great and learned works into a small and popular form. He\r\ngenerally wrote under the name of “John Burton.” His “Historical\r\nRarities in London and Westminster,” was one of the books Dr Johnson, in\r\nhis old age, desired to read again in remembrance of the pleasure\r\nderived from their teaching in the days of his youth.\r\n\r\nAt Finedon, three miles from Wellingborough, there is an old inn, called\r\nthe BELL, having for a sign the portrait of a female with the following\r\nlines beneath:--\r\n\r\n  “Queen Edith, lady once of Finedon,\r\n  Where at the Bell good fare is dined on.”\r\n\r\nThe BELL INN, kept by John Good, at Oxford, has:--\r\n\r\n  “My name, likewise my ale, is good,\r\n  Walk in and taste my own home brew’d;\r\n  For all that know John Good can tell,\r\n  That, like my sign, it bears the Bell.”\r\n\r\nThere was a GOLDEN BELL, in St Bride’s Lane, Fleet Street, in the reign\r\nof Queen Anne, next door to which lived Lydia Burcraft, a female\r\nhairdresser, who, as appears from her bill,[672] sold an infallible\r\npomatum to make the hair grow long and curly. The BLACK BELL is\r\nmentioned by Stowe, p. 81:--\r\n\r\n  “Above this lane’s [Crooked Lane] end upon Fish Hill Street, is one\r\n  great house, for the most part built of stone, which pertained some\r\n  time to Edward the Black Prince, son to Edward III., who was in his\r\n  lifetime lodged there. It is now altered to a common hostelry, having\r\n  the Black Bell for a sign.”\r\n\r\nThe Monument now stands on the site of this house.\r\n\r\nThe Bell occurs in innumerable combinations, most of which seem to have\r\nno particular meaning, but simply to arise from the old custom of\r\nquartering signs. Among them, we may mention the BELL AND ANCHOR,\r\nHammersmith, which was much visited by the fashion in the beginning of\r\nthe reign of George III. Representations of the place and its visitors\r\nmay be seen in several of the caricatures of that period, published by\r\nBowles and Carver, of St Paul’s Churchyard. It is still in existence,\r\nbut its days of glory are past, for, instead of youth and beauty, and\r\n“names known to chivalry,” its customers now mostly consist of the Irish\r\nlabourers who live in the lanes and back slums of North End. Further, we\r\nmeet with the BELL AND LION, Crew, Cheshire; the BELL AND BULLOCK,\r\nNetherem, Penrith, probably united on account of the alliteration; the\r\nBELL AND CUCKOO, Erdington, near Birmingham; and the BELL AND\r\nCANDLESTICK, also in Birmingham.\r\n\r\nThe BELL AND CROWN is very common, and withal is a reasonable\r\ncombination, for the bell has, from time immemorial, been rung to\r\nexpress the loyalty of the nation on royal entries, whether into the\r\nworld or into a town, on occasion of royal marriages or deaths, at times\r\nof great victories and declarations of peace, and other loyal\r\ncelebrations. Hence many bells are inscribed with the words, “=Fear God,\r\nhonour the King=,” which, in the beginning of the eighteenth century,\r\nseems also to have been a common inscription on the sign of the\r\nBell.[673] This sentiment was thus versified by a sign-painter, who\r\nevidently had more loyalty than poetical genius:--\r\n\r\n  “Let the King\r\n  Live Long,\r\n  Dong Ding,\r\n  Ding Dong.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHREE ANGELS.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Bills, 1770.)\r\n\r\nNAKED MAN.\r\n\r\n(From a print, 1542.)\r\n\r\nFIRE BALLOON.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1780.)\r\n\r\nTHREE MORRIS DANCERS.\r\n\r\n(Formerly in Old Change, Cheapside, circa 1668.)]\r\n\r\nFew signs have so often been wrongly explained as the BELL SAVAGE, on\r\nLudgate Hill. Stow, generally so accurate, says it received its name\r\nfrom one Isabella Savage, who had given the house to the company of\r\ncutlers. Where he gathered that information we do not know, but he was\r\n“burning,” as the children say, and was certainly much nearer the truth\r\nthan the _Spectator_, who states that it was called after a French play\r\nof “la Belle Sauvage.” The “Antiquarian Repertory,” following Stow,\r\nasserts that the inn was once the property of the Lady Arabella Savage,\r\nfamiliarly called “Bell Savage,” which name was represented in a rebus\r\nby a wild man and a bell, and so it was always drawn on the panels of\r\nthe coaches that used to run to and from it, until the railways changed\r\nour style of travelling. The true origin of the name is manifest from a\r\ndocument in the Clause Roll, 31 Henry VI.[674]\r\n\r\n  “D. Script, irrot. Frenssh.\r\n\r\n  Omnib; Xpi fidelib; ad quos p’sens Scriptum p’ven.

In cugis rei testimoniū, &c.”[675]\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, the Belle Savage appears to have been a place\r\nof amusement. “Those who go to Paris garden, the _Bel Savage_, or\r\ntheatre, to behold bear-baiting, interludes, or fence play, must not\r\naccount of any pleasant spectacle unless they first pay one penny at the\r\ngate, another at the entry of the scaffold, and a third for quiet\r\nstanding.”[676] One of the attractions about that period was Banks’s\r\nwonderful horse, Marocco, which here performed his tricks before a\r\nhalf-admiring, half-awe-stricken audience, many of whom doubtless\r\nconsidered the animal a witch, if not a devil. “To mine host of the Bel\r\nSauage and all his honest guests,” was dedicated the satirical tract of\r\n“Marocco Extaticus,” in which this horse is introduced.[677] During the\r\ncivil wars we find this inn mentioned as apparently a Royalist house:\r\n“Upon search at Bell Savage (by order of Parliament) great quantities of\r\nplate were found, intended for York, but stayed by order.”[678] A very\r\nodd accident happened in this inn during the terrific storm of November\r\n26, 1703. A Mr Hempson, we are told, was blown in his sleep out of an\r\nupper room window, and knew nothing of the storm nor of his aerial\r\nvoyage, till awaking, he found himself lying in his bed on Ludgate hill.\r\nNo doubt the good wine of mine host must have had something to do with\r\nthis miraculous flight.[679] Having been for centuries a coaching inn,\r\nits name spread to the provinces, and some inn-keepers copied its sign,\r\nwhence we meet with LA BELLE SAUVAGE, Macclesfield, and in one or two\r\nother places.\r\n\r\nBalls were extremely common in former times, frequently in combination\r\nwith other objects; this arose from the custom of the silk mercers in\r\nhanging out a GOLDEN BALL. Constantine the Great adopted a golden globe\r\n(termed _Hesa_) as the emblem of his imperial dignity, on which, after\r\nhe embraced Christianity, he placed a cross, and with this addition it\r\ncontinues as one of the insignia of royalty at the present day. The\r\nearly silk-mercers adopted this golden globe, or ball, as their sign,\r\nbecause in the middle ages, all silk was brought from the East, and more\r\nparticularly from Byzantium and the imperial manufactories there, whence\r\nit was called _serica Constantinopolitana_, _pannus imperialis_,\r\n_Basilica_, de _Basilicio_, ρηγικον, &c. The Golden Ball continued as a\r\nsilk-mercer’s sign until the end of the last century, when it gradually\r\nfell to the Berlin wool shops, and with them it continues at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBalls of various colours were invariably the signs of quacks and\r\nfortune-tellers in the eighteenth century; the Bagford Bills are full of\r\nRed, Blue, Black, White, and Green Balls, all signs of those gentry who\r\nprofess to cure all the evils flesh is heir to. How they came to choose\r\nthis sign is hard to say, for we can scarcely imagine that they were\r\nintended to represent magnified pills. Moorfields[680] was the\r\nhead-quarters of this trade:--\r\n\r\n  “If in Moorfields a Lady stroles\r\n  Among the _Globes_ and _Golden Balls_,\r\n  Where ere they hang she may be certain\r\n  Of knowing what shall be her fortune.\r\n  Her husband too, I dare to say,\r\n  But that she better knows than they.”\r\n\r\n  _Compleat Vintner_, London, 1720, p. 38.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Ball was the sign of J. Osborne, bookseller in Paternoster\r\nRow, _circa_ 1740, who printed one of the earliest “London Directories;”\r\nalso of Doctor Forman in Lambeth Marsh, who was deeply implicated in the\r\nmurder of Sir Thomas Overbury in 1613. The TWO GOLDEN BALLS at the upper\r\nend of Bow Street, Covent Garden, was a place famous for concerts,\r\nballs, and other amusements, in the end of the seventeenth and the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century. Prince Eugene once attended a\r\nconcert at this house. The TWO WHITE BALLS, in Marylebone Street, was\r\nthe sign of a school in 1712, where Latin, French, mathematics, &c.,\r\nwere taught; in the same house there also lived a clergyman who taught\r\n“to write well in _three_ days.”[681]\r\n\r\nThe balls of the silk mercers and the quacks, suspended from an iron\r\nabove the door, were generally added (in name at least) to the painted\r\nsign, when the house possessed one; as, for instance, the BALL AND CAP,\r\nHatton Garden, 1668; the BALL AND RAVEN, Spitalfields, in the\r\nseventeenth century, (both on trades tokens;) the RED BALL AND ACORN,\r\nQueen Street, Cheapside, “a [quack] gentlewoman, daughter of an eminent\r\nphysician in 1722;”[682] the PLOUGH AND BALL, at Nuneaton; the SALMON\r\nAND BALL, several in London; the BIBLE AND BALL, a bookseller’s in Ave\r\nMaria Lane, 1761; the HEART AND BALL, a silk-mercer’s in Little Britain,\r\n1710; the GREEN MAN AND BALL, on a trades token of Charter House Lane,\r\nwhere the man is represented throwing a ball; and thus innumerable other\r\ncombinations with the Ball might be mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe THREE BLUE BALLS, generally a pawnbroker’s sign, was also in old\r\ntimes used for taverns and other houses, while pawnbrokers used at\r\npleasure such signs as the BLACKAMOOR’S HEAD, the BLACK DOG AND STILL,\r\n&c.[683] On 26th March 1668, Pepys tells us that, coming from the\r\ntheatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, he and his party went to the BLUE BALLS\r\ntavern in the same locality, where they met some of their friends,\r\nincluding Mrs Knipp;\r\n\r\n  “And after much difficulty in getting of musick, we to dancing and\r\n  then to a supper of French dishes, which yet did not please me, and\r\n  then to dance and sing, and mighty merry we were till about eleven or\r\n  twelve at night, with mighty great content in all my company, and I\r\n  did, _as I love to do_, enjoy myself. My wife extraordinary fine\r\n  to-day, in her flower tabby suit, bought a year and more ago, before\r\n  my mother’s death put her into mourning, and so not worn till this\r\n  day, and everybody in love with it, and, indeed, she is very fine and\r\n  handsome in it. I having paid the reckoning, which came to almost £4,\r\n  we parted.”\r\n\r\nWhat a delightful flow of animal spirits that old Secretary of the\r\nAdmiralty enjoyed! Alas, for the awful dignity of his modern successors!\r\n\r\nThere is still a public-house sign of the Blue Balls, at Newport, I.W.\r\n\r\nThe RING AND BALL, Fenchurch Street, 1700, seems suggested by the game\r\nof pall mall, recently revived under the name of croquet, in which a\r\nball was struck by a mallet through an iron ring. This sign is mentioned\r\nin an advertisement of some valuable trinkets which had been lost:--\r\n\r\n  “A gold watch in a plain case, made by Thompson, with the hours of the\r\n  day only; a gold chain, pear fashion, two lengths, with a gold\r\n  watch-hook of Filegrin Indian work, and hung on it a diamond locket,\r\n  large diamonds with hair in the middle and death at length on a\r\n  tombstone; another diamond locket, less diamonds, with a cypher in\r\n  hair; a red cornelian set in gold engraved with a head; a plain locket\r\n  with A. K. in golden letters; a civet-box with a white stone, and\r\n  engraved on it outwards a small head and a camel [cameo?] Whosoever\r\n  stops them if offered to be pawned or valued, and gives notice to Mr\r\n  Hankey at the _Ring and Ball_ in Fenchurch Street, shall have 5\r\n  guineas for the whole, or proportionable for any part.”[684] A small\r\n  inducement to honesty!\r\n\r\nThe BAT AND BALL is a common sign for public-houses frequented by\r\ncricketers; also the CRICKETERS’ ARMS, the FIVE CRICKETERS, and many\r\nothers. The WRESTLERS obtain their name from a sport formerly in great\r\nfavour in this country, and still cultivated in some parts. At Yarmouth\r\nan inn of that name is more celebrated for the _jeu d’esprit_ of the\r\nimmortal Nelson than anything else. When the fleet was riding in the\r\nYarmouth roads, the landlord, desirous of the patronage of the\r\nblue-jackets, requested permission to call his house the Nelson Arms.\r\nHis lordship gave him full power to do so, but at the same time reminded\r\nhim that his _arms_ were only in the singular number.\r\n\r\n  “Odium quod certaminibus ortum ultra metum durat,”\r\n\r\nsays Velleius Paterculus, and the truth of the assertion is exemplified\r\nin the old national antipathy betwixt this country and our neighbours\r\nacross the channel, whence the ANTIGALLICAN (the name assumed by a\r\nLondon association in the middle of the last century) could not fail to\r\nbe a favourite sign. At present this feeling exists to only a very small\r\nextent in the minds of our lower orders; but formerly a Frenchman could\r\nnot pass through the streets of London with impunity. Stephen Perlin, a\r\nFrench ecclesiastic, who wrote in 1558 a description of England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland, says:--\r\n\r\n  “The people of this country have a mortal hatred for the French as\r\n  their ancient enemies, and in common call us _France chenesve_ [French\r\n  knave], France dogue, which is to say, French rascals and French dogs.\r\n  They also call us _or son_.”\r\n\r\nGrosley[685] devotes a whole chapter to this subject, and tells us that\r\nthe French were ridiculed on the stage, and insulted and ill-treated in\r\nthe streets. Even at the present day, when the penny romances are in\r\nwant of a melodramatic villain, a Frenchman is sure to have the honour\r\nof personating him.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this century there was a tavern of this name in\r\nShire Lane, Temple Bar, kept by Harry Lee, of sporting notoriety, and\r\nfather of Alexander Lee, the first and “original _tiger_,” in which\r\ncapacity he was produced by the notorious Lord Barrymore. This tavern\r\nwas much frequented by his lordship and other gentlemen fond of low\r\nlife, pugilism, and so-called sport. The nicknames of the brothers\r\nBarrymore will give a tolerably good idea of their amiable qualities;\r\nthe eldest was called _Hellgate_; the second _Cripplegate_, (he was\r\nlame,) and the third _Newgate_, so styled, because, though an honourable\r\nand a reverend, he had been in almost every gaol in England except\r\nNewgate. This interesting family circle was completed by a sister,\r\ncalled _Billingsgate_, on account of the forcible and flowery language\r\nshe made use of. The Antigallican is still in vogue, as there are three\r\npublic-houses with that sign in London, besides some in the country, and\r\nan ANTIGALLICAN ARMS at New Charlton, Kent.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of September 1783, the first balloon--or air-balloon as it\r\nwas then called--was let off at Versailles, in the presence of Louis\r\nXVI. and the Royal Family. A sheep was the first aeronaut, and with this\r\nfreight, in a cage, the balloon rose to a height of about 200 yards,\r\nfloated over a part of Paris, and came down in the Carrefour Maréchal.\r\nThe novelty was at once taken hold of by caricaturists, ballad-mongers,\r\nwriters of comic articles, and also by the sign-painters. One of the\r\nfirst balloon-signs in London was that of the BALLOON FRUIT-SHOP, in\r\nOxford Street, near Soho Square.[686] As those primitive balloons were,\r\nin the opinion of the vulgar, filled with _smoke_, the tobacconists\r\nconsidered them as within their province, and thus it became a favourite\r\ndevice with this class of shops. Several of their tobacco papers are\r\npreserved in the Banks collection. One has the following legend:--“The\r\nbest Virginia under the Balloon.” Another, “Smoke the best balloon.” A\r\nthird, “The best air-balloon tobacco,” &c. Some of these balloon-cuts\r\nwill be found in our illustrations. One of them represents a balloon\r\nascending, and two smokers standing beneath; one says, “I wish them a\r\ngood voyage;” the other, “Smoak the balloon.” As a sign, the BALLOON, or\r\nAIR-BALLOON, is still not uncommon, and may be seen at Kingston, Hants,\r\nBirdlip, Gloucester, &c.\r\n\r\nThe BLACK DOLL, hung at the doors of rag and marine store-dealers,\r\nprobably originated in these shops buying old clothes and finery, which\r\nwas sold to the buccaneers and coasting-traders, who exchanged them with\r\nthe natives of Africa and America, for gold, ivory, furs, &c.; just as\r\nwe see at the present day, Mr Abraham, or Mr Isaacs, constantly\r\nadvertising in the _Times_ for our “Left-off clothes for Australia and\r\nthe Colonies.” The popular legend, however, has spread a halo of romance\r\naround the black doll. Once upon a time, an ancient dame came to a\r\nrag-shop in Norton Folgate, with a bundle of old clothes, which she\r\ndesired to sell, but having no time to spare, she left them with the man\r\nto examine, promising to call for the money next day. The rag-merchant\r\nopened the bundle and found amongst the clothes a pair of diamond\r\near-rings, and a black doll. Anxious to restore the diamonds, (as may be\r\nimagined,) he expected the old woman to call day after day, but in vain;\r\nat last, thinking that she might have forgotten the house, he hung up\r\nthe black doll at the door, but the old woman never came, and the doll\r\nhung until it rotted away, when it was replaced by a new one. The\r\nnovelty of the object attracted many customers to the house, other\r\nragmen imitated it, and so it finally became a sign, one which is now\r\nfast dying away, and being supplanted by coarse coloured prints, with\r\nabsurd rhymes.\r\n\r\nAt the castles of the nobility the weary traveller formerly found food,\r\nshelter, and good “herborow;” the lower hall was always open to the\r\nadventurer, the tramp, the minstrel, and the pilgrim; the upper hall to\r\nthe nobleman, the squire, the wealthy abbot, and the fair ladies. It was\r\nnatural, then, that the CASTLE should at an early period have been\r\nadopted as a sign of “good entertainment for man and beast.” Such a sign\r\nbecame historical in the Wars of the Roses; for the Duke of Somerset,\r\nwho had been warned to “shun castles,” was killed by Richard\r\nPlantagenet, at an ale-house, the sign of the Castle.\r\n\r\n  “For underneath an ale-house’ paltry sign,\r\n  The Castle in Saint-Albans, Somerset\r\n  Hath made the Wizard famous in his death.”\r\n\r\n  2 _Henry VI._, ac. v., sc. 2.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hatton,[687] in 1708, the Castle Tavern in Fleet Street had\r\nthe largest sign in London; next to it came the WHITE HART Inn, on the\r\neast side of the Borough, in Southwark.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of George I., the Castle, near Covent Garden, was a famous\r\neating-house, kept by John Pierce, the Soyer of his day. Here the\r\ngallant feat was performed of a young blood taking one of the shoes from\r\nthe foot of a noted toast, filling it with wine, and drinking her\r\nhealth, after which it was consigned to the cook, who prepared from it\r\nan excellent _ragout_, which was eaten with great relish by the lady’s\r\nadmirers.\r\n\r\nThe CASTLE AND FALCON (probably a combination of two signs, as there is\r\na Falcon Court close by,) is the sign of an inn in Aldersgate, which\r\nhouse, or one on its site, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was occupied\r\nby John Day, the most considerable printer and publisher of his time. In\r\nafter years the house became a famous coaching inn, and its reputation\r\nspread to all parts of England, whence we meet, at present, with Castles\r\nand Falcons in various towns, as at Birmingham, Chester, &c. Although we\r\nincline to the opinion that the sign arose from a combination, still it\r\nis worthy of remark, that the crest of Queen Catherine Parr was a\r\ncrowned falcon, perched on a castle, and of course represented as large\r\nas the castle.\r\n\r\nThe THREE OLD CASTLES occurs at Mandeville, near Somerton; the CASTLE\r\nAND BANNER at Hunny Hill, Carisbrooke, originating in the banner\r\nfloating from the castle turret, when the Lord of the Manor was residing\r\nthere. CASTLES IN THE AIR is to be seen at Lower Quay, Fareham; the\r\norigin seems to be an allusion to the ordinary sign swinging in\r\nmid-air--a piece of humour on the part of the landlord. The CASTLE AND\r\nWHEELBARROW, at Rouse Lench, was, doubtless, another innkeeper’s notion\r\nof suggestive humour--but he was a dull wit.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most patriarchal of all signs is the CHEQUERS, which may be\r\nseen even on houses in exhumed Pompeii. On that of Hercules, for\r\ninstance, at the corner of the Strada Fullonica, they are painted\r\nlozenge-wise, red, white, and yellow, and on various other houses in\r\nthat ancient city, similar decorations may still be observed. Originally\r\nit is said to have indicated that draughts and backgammon were played\r\nwithin. Brand, in his “Popular Antiquities,” ignorant of any existence\r\nof the sign in so remote a period as that mentioned, says that it\r\nrepresented the coat of arms of the Earls of Warenne and Surrey, who\r\nbore checqui or and azure, and in the reign of Edward IV., possessed the\r\nprivilege of licensing ale-houses. A more plausible explanation, and one\r\nwhich is not set aside by the existence of the sign in Pompeii, is that\r\ngiven by Dr Lardner:--\r\n\r\n  “During the middle ages, it was usual for merchants, accountants, and\r\n  judges, who arranged matters of revenue, to appear on a covered banc,\r\n  so called from an old Saxon word, meaning a seat, (hence our Bank.)\r\n  Before them was placed a flat surface, divided by parallel white\r\n  lines, into perpendicular columns; these again divided transversely by\r\n  lines crossing the former, so as to separate each column into squares.\r\n  This table was called an Exchequer, from its resemblance to a\r\n  chess-board, and the calculations were made by counters placed on its\r\n  several divisions, (something after the manner of the Roman abacus.) A\r\n  money-changer’s office was generally indicated by a sign of the\r\n  chequered board suspended. This sign afterwards came to indicate an\r\n  inn or house of entertainment, probably from the circumstance of the\r\n  innkeeper also following the trade of money-changer--a coincidence\r\n  still very common in seaport towns.”[688]\r\n\r\nChaucer’s Merry Pilgrims put up in Canterbury, at the sign of the\r\n“Checker of the Hope,” (_i.e._ the Chequers on the Hoop.)\r\n\r\n  “They took their in and loggit them at mydmorowe, I trowe,\r\n  Atte _cheker of the Hope_ that many a man doth knowe.”\r\n\r\n  _Ludgate’s Continuation of the Canterbury Tales._\r\n\r\nThis inn (says Mr Wright, in his edition of the above work) is still\r\npointed out in Canterbury, at the corner of High Street and Mercery\r\nLane, and is often mentioned in the Corporation Reports, under the title\r\nof the _Chequer_. It is situated in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nCathedral, and was therefore appropriate for the reception of the\r\npilgrims.\r\n\r\nWhen the inn had another sign besides the Chequers, these last were\r\ninvariably painted on the door-post; an example of this may still be\r\nseen at the SWISS COTTAGE, Chelsea. In or near Calcots Alley, Lambeth,\r\nwas formerly situated an inn or house of entertainment called the\r\nChequers. In the year 1454 a licence was granted to its landlord, John\r\nCalcot, to have an oratory in the house and a chaplain for the use of\r\nhis family and guests, as long as his house should continue orderly and\r\nrespectable, and adapted to the celebration of divine service.[689] The\r\nBLACK CHEQUERS in Cowgate, Norwich, is so called on account of the\r\nchequers being black and white, whilst others are red and white, blue\r\nand white, or in such other contrast as may be fancied by the publican.\r\n\r\nThe CROOKED BILLET is a sign, for which we have not been able to\r\ndiscover any likely origin; it may have been originally a ragged staff,\r\nor a pastoral staff, or a _baton cornu_--the ancient name for a\r\nbattle-axe.[690] It is also the name for a part of the tankard.\r\nFrequently the sign is represented by an untrimmed stick suspended above\r\nthe door, as at Wold Newton, near Bridlington, where it is accompanied\r\nby the following poetical effusion on one side of the signboard:--\r\n\r\n  “When this comical stick grew in the wood,\r\n  Our ale was fresh and very good;\r\n  Step in and taste, O do make haste,\r\n  For if you don’t ’twill surely waste.”\r\n\r\nOn the other side:--\r\n\r\n  “When you have viewed the other side,\r\n  Come read this too before you ride,\r\n  And now to end we’ll let it pass;\r\n  Step in, kind friends, and take a glass.”\r\n\r\nThough a very rustic sign, it was also used in towns; thus it occurs\r\namong the trades tokens of Montague Close, and was the sign of Andrew\r\nSowle, a bookseller in Holloway Lane, Shoreditch, in 1683.\r\n\r\nThe GOLDEN HEAD appears to have been a favourite with artists, probably\r\na classic or modern bust gilded. It was the sign of Hogarth’s master and\r\nof himself.\r\n\r\n  “Hogarth made one essay in sculpture. He wanted a sign to distinguish\r\n  his house in Leicester Fields; and thinking none more proper than the\r\n  Golden Head, he out of a mass of cork made up several thicknesses\r\n  compacted together, carved a bust of Van Dyke, which he gilt and\r\n  placed over his door. It is long since decayed, and was succeeded by a\r\n  head in plaister, which has also perished, and is succeeded by a head\r\n  of Sir Isaac Newton.”--_Nichols’s Anecdotes of Hogarth._\r\n\r\nAt this sign in 1735 Hogarth published the “Harlot’s Progress,” and\r\nseveral other engravings. Sir Robert Strange the engraver (1721-92)\r\nlived at the Golden Head, Henrietta Street, Covent Garden; and in 1762\r\nthe portrait of Cunneshote, one of the Cherokee chiefs, then on a visit\r\nto this country, was for sale at the Golden Head in Queen Square, Ormond\r\nStreet; it was engraved after a painting by Francis Parsons. In 1700 it\r\nwas the sign of a Monsieur Desert, “almost over against the King’s\r\nBagnio in Long Acre, who sold guitars from 30 gs. to 30 sh. a\r\npiece.”[691] Thomas Carte the historian (1686 to 1754) lived at Mr Ker’s\r\nat the Golden Head, Newport Street, Long Acre. This sign also occurs in\r\na most amusing advertisement:--\r\n\r\n  “_An Exceeding Small Lap Spaniel._\r\n\r\n  ANY ONE THAT has (to dispose of) such a one, either dog or bitch, and\r\n  of any colour or colours, that is very, very small, with a very short\r\n  round snub nose, and good ears, if they will bring it to Mrs Smith, at\r\n  a coachmaker’s over against the _Golden Head_ in Great Queen Street,\r\n  near Lincoln’s Inn Fields, they shall (if approved of) have a very\r\n  good purchaser. And to prevent any further trouble, if it is not\r\n  exceeding small, and has anything of a longish peaked nose, it will\r\n  not at all do. And nevertheless after this advertisement is published\r\n  no more, if any person should have a little creature that answers the\r\n  character of the advertisement, if they will please but to remember\r\n  the direction and bring it to Mrs Smith; the person is not _so_\r\n  provided but that such a one will still at any time be hereafter\r\n  purchased.”--_Daily Advertiser_, Nov. 1744.\r\n\r\nThe TWO HEADS was the sign of a dentist in Coventry Street in 1760. One\r\nhead probably represented the mouth as possessing a fine set of teeth;\r\nthe other doubtless showed how unfortunate is their absence. The\r\nadvertisements of this man are gems in their way:--\r\n\r\n  “Ye Beauties, Beaux, ye Pleaders at the Bar,\r\n  Wives, Husbands, lovers, every one beside,\r\n  Wh’d have their heads deficient rectify’d,\r\n  The Dentist famed who by just application\r\n  Excels each other operator in the Nation,\r\n  In Coventry’s known street, near Leicester Fields,\r\n  At the _Two Heads_ full satisfaction yields.\r\n  Teeth artificial he fixes so secure,\r\n  That as our own they usefully endure;\r\n  Not merely outside show and ornament\r\n  But ev’ry property of Teeth intent;\r\n  To eat, as well as speak, and form support\r\n  The falling cheeks and stumps from further hurt.\r\n  Nor is he daunted when the whole is gone,\r\n  But by an art-peculiar to him known,\r\n  He’ll so supply you’ll think you’ve got your own.\r\n  He scales, he cleans, he draws; in Pain gives Ease,\r\n  Nor in each operation doth fail to please.\r\n  Doth the foul scurvy fierce your Gums assault?\r\n  In this he also rectifies the Fault\r\n  By a fam’d Tincture. And his Powder nam’d\r\n  A Dentifrice is also justly fam’d.\r\n  Us’d as directed ’tis excellent to serve\r\n  Both teeth and gums, cleanse, strengthen, and preserve;\r\n  Foul mouth and stinking breath can ne’er be loved.\r\n  But by his aid those evils are removed.”\r\n\r\n  _London Evening Post_, July 1760.\r\n\r\nTaylor the Water poet (1632) mentions two taverns with the sign of the\r\nMOUTH, the one without Bishopsgate, the other within Aldersgate. Trades\r\ntokens of the first house are extant, representing a human head with a\r\nhuge mouth wide open. An inventory is still extant of the stock in trade\r\nof this house in the year 1612,[692] which is not uninteresting. From it\r\nwe gather that the wines drunk at that period in taverns were white\r\nwine, Vin de Grave, (a small white Burgundy wine,) Orleans wine, Malaga,\r\nsherry, sack, Malmsey, (Malvasia, a wine from the coast of Morea, sweet\r\nand white,) Alicante, (also sweet,) claret, &c. Beer seems to have been\r\nbut little asked for by those that frequented this house; for whilst\r\nsome of the wines were kept in such large quantities as seven hogsheads,\r\nthere were only two dozen and eight bottles of ale. The names of the\r\nrooms in the house were “the Pomegranate,” “the Portcullis,” “Three\r\nTuns,” “Cross Keys,” “Vine,” “King’s Head,” “Crown,” “Dolphin,” and\r\n“Bell,” all of them favourite tavern signs, and (as remarked on page\r\n280) the usual names for tavern rooms. Among the utensils may be\r\nremarked fifteen silver bowls.\r\n\r\nThe MERRY MOUTH is still a sign at Fifield, Chipping Norton.\r\n\r\nThe HAND was the sign of a victualler near the Marshalsea in Southwark,\r\nin 1680. Hands occur in many combinations, owing to the custom of\r\ndraughtsmen and sign-painters representing a hand issuing from the\r\nclouds to perform some action or hold some object; thus a hand holding a\r\ncoffee-pot was a very general coffee-house sign. The “Hand” seems to\r\nhave been a bad or evil sign:--\r\n\r\n  “I’ll go back to the country of the coffee-houses, [Fleet Street,]\r\n  where being arrived I’m in a wood, there are so many of them I know\r\n  not which to enter; stay, let me see, where the sign is painted with a\r\n  _woman’s hand_ in it, ’tis a bawdy house, where a _man’s_ it has\r\n  another qualification; but where it has a star in the sign ’tis\r\n  calculated for every lewd purpose.”[693]\r\n\r\nThough this is a sweeping denunciation, yet we find the HAND AND STAR\r\noccurring as the sign of a very respectable bookseller, Richard Tothill\r\nin Fleet Street, within Temple Bar, who in 1553 printed the “Dialogue of\r\nComfort,” by Sir Thomas More. Not unlikely Tothill had adopted this sign\r\nfrom the watermarks in paper, for one of the most ancient of them is a\r\nhand, either in the position of giving benediction, or in that position\r\ncalled the upright hand, with a star above it. Messrs Butterworth, the\r\nlaw-publishers, who now occupy Tothill’s premises, possess all the\r\nleases and documents from the time of that old printer down to the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nQuacks, also, were very fond of a hand in their sign, pointing to an eye\r\nor an ear, to intimate that the great doctor cured the blind or the\r\ndeaf. Thus, in the Harleian collection (5931) there is a handbill of S.\r\nKetelby, sworn physician, who lived at the HAND AND EAR, in Exeter\r\nStreet near the Strand, and who professed to cure deafness, lameness,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n  “He is capable now, not only of curing those incurable by others, but\r\n  even those he could not cure himself six months ago! Note: He resolves\r\n  all persons deaf from external causes, whether curable or not, in two\r\n  minutes, in the dark as well as at noonday, which no _other_ pretender\r\n  can do,” &c.\r\n\r\nThe HAND AND FACE was the sign of another quack, who lived in Water\r\nLane, Blackfriars, near Apothecaries’ Hall, in 1735.[694]\r\n\r\nA few combinations of the hand refer to games, as the HAND AND BALL,\r\nBarking, (trades token,) 1650, which seems to be derived from some of\r\nthe innumerable games at ball in which our ancestors delighted, such as\r\nhandball, tennis, balloon or windball, stoolball, hurling, football,\r\nstowball, pallmall, clubball, trapball, northen-spell, cricket, bowling,\r\n&c. The HAND AND TENNIS, Whitcombe Street, Haymarket, is so called from\r\nthe adjoining Tennis Court, erected in 1678. The OLD HAND AND TANKARD is\r\na public-house sign at Wheatly, near Halifax. The HAND AND TENCH seems\r\nto point to a connexion with the followers of Isaac Walton; it was a\r\nmug-house in Seven Dials in 1717. The mugs in those days used to be\r\nsuspended above the door, or on the sign-iron, not only in this, but in\r\nall the mug-houses, for the mug might be considered as much a badge of\r\nKing George’s friends, as the white cockade was the badge of the\r\nJacobites.\r\n\r\nThe HAND AND HEART was, in 1711, the very appropriate sign of a marriage\r\ninsurance office in East Harding Street, Shoe Lane.[695] Two right hands\r\nholding a heart was a very old symbol of concord. Aubrey gives\r\nquotations from Tacitus, by which he derives it from the Romans, and\r\nadds:--\r\n\r\n  “I have seen some rings made for sweethearts with a heart enamelled\r\n  held between two hands. See an Epigrame of G. Buchanan, on two rings\r\n  that were made by Q. Elisabeth’s appointment, which, being laid one\r\n  upon the other, shewed the like figure. The heart was two diamonds,\r\n  w^{ch} joyned, made the Heart. Q. Elisabeth kept one moietie, and sent\r\n  y^{e} other as a token of her constant friendship to Mary Q. of\r\n  Scotts; but she cutt off her head for all that.”[696]\r\n\r\nThe HEART IN HAND is still a common ale-house sign. A similar meaning is\r\nconveyed by the equally common HAND IN HAND or CROSS HANDS; at\r\nTurnditch, Derby, this sign is called the CROSS O’ THE HANDS, and a\r\ncorruption of this again is the CROSS IN HAND, at Waldron, Sussex. The\r\nHand in Hand was also one of the usual signs of the marriage-mongers in\r\nFleet Street. Pennant says:--\r\n\r\n  “In walking along the streets in my youth, on the side next this\r\n  prison, (the Fleet,) I have often been tempted by the question, ’Sir,\r\n  will you be pleased to walk in and be married.’ Along this most\r\n  lawless space was most frequently hung up the sign of a male and\r\n  female hand conjoined, with ‘Marriages performed within’ written\r\n  beneath. A dirty fellow invited you in; the parson was seen walking\r\n  before his shop, a squalid, profligate figure, clad in a tattered\r\n  plaid nightgown, with a fiery face, and ready to couple you for a dram\r\n  of gin or a roll of tobacco.”\r\n\r\nThe two hands conjoined is also common in France--where it is called _à\r\nla bonne Foi_. In 1624 it was the sign of Pierre Billaine, bookseller\r\nand printer in the Rue St Jacques, Paris.\r\n\r\nThe LEG used formerly to be at the door of every hosier. It was also the\r\nsign of a tavern in King Street, Westminster, frequented by Pepys.\r\nTrades tokens are extant of the LEG AND STAR, kept by Richard Finch, in\r\nAldersgate, in the seventeenth century. It may have represented a leg\r\nwith the garter round it, and the star of that order; but more probably\r\nit was a combination of two signs.\r\n\r\nThe OLD MAN, Market Place, Westminster, was probably intended for Old\r\nParr, who was celebrated in ballads as “The Olde, Olde, Very Olde\r\nManne.” The token represents a bearded bust in profile, with a bare\r\nhead. In the reign of James I. it was the name of a tavern in the\r\nStrand, otherwise called the Hercules Tavern, and in the eighteenth\r\ncentury there were two coffee-houses, the one called the OLD MAN’S, the\r\nother the YOUNG MAN’S Coffee-house.\r\n\r\nThe FOUNTAIN was a favourite sign with the Londoners before the\r\nReformation, perhaps on account of its connexion with the martyrdom of\r\nSt Paul, whose head, says the legend, on being struck off, rebounded\r\nthree times, when a fountain gushed up at each spot where the sacred\r\nhead had touched the ground. Hence there is a church near Rome, in the\r\nmidst of the desolate Campagna, called San Paolo delle Tre Fontane,\r\nwhere altars are raised over each of those three fountains. There is\r\nalso a fountain connected with the martyrdom of St Alban, the English\r\nprotomartyr, and Saints’ Wells may be met with all over the kingdom.\r\n\r\nDuring the Plague of 1665, the following advertisement used to figure\r\nconstantly in the papers:--\r\n\r\n  “MONSIEUR AUGIER’S famous Remedies for stopping and preventing the\r\n  plague having not only been recommended by several certificates from\r\n  Lyons, Paris, Thoulouse, &c., but likewise experimented here by the\r\n  special directions of the Lords of his Majesty’s most honourable Privy\r\n  Council, and proved by Witnesses upon oath, and several Tryals, to be\r\n  of singular virtue and effect, are to be had at Mr Drinkwater’s, at\r\n  the Fountain, in Fleet Street, &c.”[697]\r\n\r\nMr Drinkwater had evidently intended a pun by selecting a fountain as\r\nhis sign.\r\n\r\nThe Fountain Tavern in the Strand was famous as the meeting-place of the\r\nultra-loyal party in 1685, who here talked over public affairs before\r\nthe meeting of Parliament. Roger Lestrange, who had been recently\r\nknighted by the king, took a leading part in these consultations. But\r\n“the fate of things lies always in the dark;” in the reign of George II.\r\nthis same house became a great resort for the Whigs, who sometimes used\r\nto meet here as many as two hundred at a time, making speeches and\r\npassing resolutions.\r\n\r\nFor this reason it was proposed that Master Jephson the landlord should\r\nwrite under his sign:--\r\n\r\n    “Hoc Fonte derivata libertas\r\n    In Patriam, Populumq: fluxit.”\r\n\r\n  “From this fam’d Fountain Freedom flow’d,\r\n  For Britain’s and the People’s good.”\r\n\r\nIn this tavern, Law, subsequently famous as the Mississippi schemer,\r\nquarrelled with the magnificent and mysterious Beau Wilson; they left\r\nthe house, adjourned to Bloomsbury Square, and fought a duel, in which\r\nthe Beau was killed. The Kit Cat Club, in winter, used to meet at this\r\nhouse. This club was first established in an obscure house in Shire\r\nLane; it consisted of thirty-nine distinguished noblemen or gentlemen,\r\nzealously attached to the Protestant succession of the house of Hanover.\r\nAmong the members were the Dukes of Richmond, Devonshire, Marlborough,\r\nSomerset, Grafton, Newcastle, and Dorset, the Earls of Sunderland and\r\nManchester, some lords, and Steele, Addison, Congreve, Garth, Vanbrugh,\r\nManwaring, Stepney, Walpole, and Pulteney; Lord Mohun (implicated in the\r\nmurder of Mountford the actor, and killed in a duel by the Duke of\r\nHamilton) was also a member.\r\n\r\n  “The day Lord Mohun and the Earl of Berwick were entered of it, Jacob\r\n  [Tonson, the secretary] said he saw they were just going to be ruined.\r\n  When Lord Mohun broke down the gilded emblem on the top of his chair,\r\n  Jacob complained to his friends, and said a man who would do that\r\n  would cut a man’s throat.”[698]\r\n\r\nTonson, for fulfilling the duties of this honorary office, was presented\r\nwith the portraits of all the members. After Jacob’s death, his brother\r\nRichard removed the pictures to his residence at Water Oakley, near\r\nWindsor. A list of them is to be found in Bray’s “History of Surrey,”\r\nvol. iii., p. 318. Forty-three of them have been engraved by Faber in\r\nmezzotint. The name of the club is said to have been derived from the\r\nfirst landlord, who was called Christopher Cat; he excelled in the\r\nmaking of mutton-pies, which were named after him Kit Cat, and were the\r\nstandard dish of the club.\r\n\r\n  “Here did th’ assembly’s title first arise,\r\n  And Kit Cat’s wits sprung first from Kit Cat’s pies.”\r\n\r\nNext door to the Fountain Tavern lived Charles Lillie, the celebrated\r\nsnuff-seller of the _Spectators_ and _Tatlers_, but “he was burnt out\r\nwhen he began to have a reputation in his way.”--(_Tatler_, xcii.)\r\n\r\nThe FOUNTAIN AND BEAR is a sign named in the following quaint imprint:--\r\n\r\n  “A Present for Teeming Women, or Scripture Directions for Women with\r\n  childe; how to prepare for the hour of Travel. Written first for the\r\n  private use of a Gentlewoman of quality in the West, and now published\r\n  for the common good by John Oliver, _less than the least of saints_.\r\n  Sold by Mary Rothwell, at the Fountain and Bear, in Cheapside, 1663.”\r\n\r\nThe SUN and the MOON have been considered as signs of Pagan origin,\r\ntypifying Apollo and Diana. Whether or no this conjecture be true, would\r\nbe difficult to prove, but certain it is that they rank among the oldest\r\nand most common signs, not only in England but on the Continent. Early\r\nin the sixteenth century the French poet Desiré Arthus wrote in his\r\n“Loyaulté Consciencieuse des Taverniers:”--\r\n\r\n  “Sur les chemins des grands villes et champs,\r\n  Ne trouverez de douze maisons l’une,\r\n  Qui n’ait enseigne d’un soleil, d’une lune.\r\n  Tous vendant vin, chascun à son quartier.”[699]\r\n\r\nLike the Star, (see p. 501,) the Sun did not enjoy a good reputation.\r\nHenry Peacham thus cautions young men from the country:--\r\n\r\n  “Let a monyed man or gentleman especially beware in the city, _ab\r\n  istis calidis et callidis solis filiabus_ as Lipsius: these overhot\r\n  and crafty daughters of the _Sunne_, your silken and gold laced\r\n  harlots, everywhere (especially in the suburbs) to be found.”[700]\r\n\r\nThe reason of this sign having been especially adopted by that\r\ndescription of houses, we are unable to state, unless it be the one Tom\r\nD’Urfey gives in “Collin’s Walk through London,” where, speaking of a\r\nfrail and fair one, he says:--\r\n\r\n  “And _like the Sun_, was understood\r\n  To all mankind a common good.”\r\n\r\nBut as the sun shines alike over good and evil, so respectable as well\r\nas disreputable persons have used him for a sign; thus Wynkyn de Worde,\r\nin Fleet Street, and Anthony Kytson, another early printer, and the\r\npublisher of some works of Master John Skelton, poet laureate, carried\r\non business under this device. Taylor the Water poet mentions three Sun\r\ntaverns: being compelled one day on his “pennylesse pilgrimage,” to dine\r\n_à la belle étoile_, he says:--“I made virtue of necessity, and went to\r\nbreakefast in the Sunne: I have fared better at three Sunnes many a time\r\nbefore now: in Aldersgate Street, Criplegate, and New Fish Street; but\r\nhere is the oddss: at those Sunnes they will come vpon a man with a\r\ntauerne bill as sharp cutting as a taylor’s bill of items: a watchman’s\r\nbill or a watch hooke falls not halfe so heauy vpon a man.”[701] The Sun\r\non Fish Street Hill is also named by Pepys:--\r\n\r\n  “Dec. 22, 1660.--Went to the Sun Tavern on Fish Street Hill, to a\r\n  dinner of Captain Teddimans, where was my Lord Inchequin, (who seems\r\n  to be a very fine person,) Sir W. Penn, Captain Cuttance, and Mr\r\n  Laurence, (a fine gentleman now going to Algiers,) and other good\r\n  company, where we had a very good dinner, good music, and a great deal\r\n  of wine. I very merry--went to bed, my head aching all night.”\r\n\r\nBut the finest of all the Sun Taverns did not exist in Taylor’s time; it\r\nwas built after the fire of 1666, behind the Exchange.\r\n\r\n  “Behind? I’ll ne’er believe it; you may as soon\r\n  Persuade me that the sun stands behind noon.”\r\n\r\nThese are the opening lines of a ballad of 1672, entitled “The Glory of\r\nthe Sun Tavern, behind the Exchange.”[702] From this ballad it is\r\nevident that the tavern was splendidly furnished, and offered comforts\r\nnot generally to be met with at that time.\r\n\r\n  “There every chamber has an aquaeduct,\r\n  As if the sun had fire for water truckt,\r\n  Water as’t were exhal’d up to heavens sprouds,\r\n  To cool your cups and glasses in the clouds.”\r\n\r\nPepys was a frequent visitor at this house, and, in fact, all the\r\npleasure-seekers of that mad reign patronised it; the profligate Duke of\r\nBuckingham, in particular, was a constant customer. Simon Wadloe, the\r\nlandlord, had made his fortune at the Devil in St Dunstan’s, whereupon\r\nhe went to live in the country, and spent his money in a couple of\r\nyears. He then “choused” Nick Colbourn out of the Sun, and Nick, who had\r\namassed a handsome competence in the house, was easily persuaded to\r\nretire, and left it “to live like a prince in the country,” says Pepys.\r\nDuring the reign of Charles II., the house appears to have had an\r\nexcellent custom, and was from morning till night full of the best\r\ncompany. The Sun Tavern, in Clare Street, was one of the haunts of the\r\nwitty Joe Miller, and is often given as the locality of his jokes:--\r\n\r\n  “Joe Miller, sitting one day in the window of the Sun Tavern, Clare\r\n  Street, a fish woman and her maid passing by, the woman cried: ‘Buy my\r\n  soals, buy my maids!’ ‘Ah! you wicked old creature,’ cry’d honest Joe,\r\n  ‘what, are you not content to sell your own soul, but you must sell\r\n  your maid’s too?’”\r\n\r\nA stereotype joke of the publican connected with the Sun is the motto,\r\n“the best liquor [generally beer] under the Sun,” which, of course, must\r\nbe believed, for _Solem quis dicere falsum audeat?_ Sometimes the sign\r\nis called the SUN IN SPLENDOUR, as at Nottinghill, the “splendour”\r\nhaving reference simply to the golden beams or rays usually drawn by the\r\npainter. There is still a carved stone sign of the Sun, now gilt, dating\r\nfrom the seventeenth century, walled in the front of a house in the\r\nPoultry.\r\n\r\nThe GOLDEN SUN was the sign of Ulrich Gering, in the Rue St Jacques,\r\nParis, printer of the first Bible in France, in 1475. At the end of the\r\nvolume the Bible thus addresses the reader:--\r\n\r\n  “Jam tribus undecimus lustris Francos Ludovicus\r\n  Rexerat; Ulricus, Martinus, itemque Michael\r\n  Orti Teutonia, hanc mihi composuere figuram\r\n  Parisii arte sua; me correctam vigilanter\r\n  Venalem in vico Jacobi _Sol Aureus_ offert.”[703]\r\n\r\nTheir successor, Berthold Rumbold, on removing the business to another\r\nhouse in the same street, opposite the Rue Fromentel, kept the same\r\nsign, and there it continued as late as 1689, having constantly been in\r\nthe hands of booksellers. Not improbably the first printers, both in\r\nEngland and abroad, adopted the sign of the Sun, as an emblem of the new\r\nera opened to the world by the invention of printing, which, when they\r\nreflected on their discovery, they saw would, at no distant period,\r\nspread an intellectual light over the world, as brilliant and as\r\nvivifying as that of the radiant sun.[704]\r\n\r\nThe sign of the Sun occurs in endless combinations, often capricious,\r\nwithout any other reason than a whim, and an alliteration, as the SUN\r\nAND SAWYERS; the SUN AND SWORD; the SUN AND SPORTSMAN; or quartered with\r\nother signs, as the SUN AND ANCHOR; DIAL; FALCON; LAST; HORSESHOE, &c.\r\nAll these, and innumerable others of the same sort, occur among the\r\nLondon public-house signs of the present day. The SUN AND HARE is a\r\nstone carved sign, walled up in the façade of a house in the High\r\nStreet, Southwark. Were it not for the initials H. N. A., it might be\r\ntaken for a rebus on the name Harrison; as it is, it may be a jocular\r\ncorruption of the Sun and Hart, the badge of Richard II. (See p. 109.)\r\n\r\nThe RISING SUN is nearly as common as the sun in his meridian; perhaps\r\non account of the favourable omen it presents for a man commencing\r\nbusiness. In 1726 it was the sign of a noted tavern in Islington, where\r\nsome merry doings went on occasionally:--\r\n\r\n  “ON TUESDAY NEXT, being Shrove Tuesday, will be a fine hog barbygu’d\r\n  whole at the house of Peter Brett, at the _Rising Sun_, in Islington\r\n  Road, with other diversions. It is the house where the ox was roasted\r\n  whole at Christmas last.”--_Mist’s Journal_, February 9, 1726.\r\n\r\nTo barbecue a hog, was a West Indian term for roasting a whole pig,\r\nstuffed with spice, and basted with Madeira wine.\r\n\r\nThe RISING SUN AND SEVEN STARS was the very appropriate sign, at which\r\nwas printed a work on “Astrological Optics;” but better still, it was\r\nprinted for R. _Moon_, whose shop was “in Paul’s Churchyarde, in the New\r\nBuilding, between the two North Doors. 1655.” An old jest-book says that\r\nan Irishman, seeing the sign of the Rising Sun was kept by A(nthony)\r\nMoon, accused the said Moon of having made a bull, for saying that the\r\nSun was kept by the Moon.\r\n\r\nOne of the learned questions propounded by Hudibras to that cunning man,\r\nSidrophel, the Rosicrucian, was:--\r\n\r\n  “Tell me but what’s the natural cause\r\n  Why on a sign no painter draws\r\n  The _full moon_ ever, but the _half_.”--_Hudibras_, part iii., c. 3.\r\n\r\nThis might be true in Butler’s time, but is no longer so; at Leicester,\r\nfor instance, there are two signs of the FULL MOON, and it occurs in\r\nmany other places. The Crescent, or HALF-MOON, was the emblem of the\r\ntemporal power, as the Sun was the distinction of the spiritual.\r\n\r\nBen Jonson once desiring a glass of sack, went to the Half-Moon Tavern,\r\nin Aldersgate Street, but found it closed, so he adjourned to the Sun\r\nTavern, in Long Lane, and wrote this epigram:--\r\n\r\n  “Since the Half Moon is so unkind,\r\n    To make me go about,\r\n  The Sun my money now shall have,\r\n    And the Moon shall go without.”\r\n\r\nThe Half-Moon, Upper Holloway, was famous in the last century for\r\nexcellent cheesecakes, which were hawked about the streets of London, by\r\na man on horseback, and formed one of the London cries. This\r\ncircumstance is noticed in a poem in the _Gentleman’s Magazine_ for\r\n1743, entitled “A Journey to Nottingham.” In April 1747, the following\r\nadvertisement appeared in the same magazine:--\r\n\r\n  “HALF-MOON TAVERN, Cheapside, April 13. His Royal Highness the _Duke\r\n  of Cumberland_ having restored peace to Britain, by the ever memorable\r\n  Battle of Culloden, fought on the 16th of April 1745, the _choice\r\n  spirits_ have agreed to celebrate that day annually by A GRAND JUBILEE\r\n  in the MOON, of which the Stars are hereby acquainted and summoned to\r\n  shine with their brightest Lustre by 6 o’clock on Thursday next in the\r\n  Evening.”\r\n\r\nThe CRESCENT AND ANCHOR is a sign at Norton-in-Hales, near Market\r\nDrayton; the HALF-MOON AND SEVEN STARS at Aston Clinton, near Tring; and\r\nthe SUN, MOON, AND SEVEN STARS at Blisworth, in Northampton. These SEVEN\r\nSTARS have always been great favourites; they seem to be the same pleiad\r\nwhich is used as a Masonic emblem--a circle of six stars, with one in\r\nthe centre; but to tell to ears profane, what this emblem means, would\r\nbe disclosing the sacred arcana. The SEVEN STARS was the sign of Richard\r\nMoone, before he was so ambitious as to place the whole firmament on his\r\nsign: in 1653 he printed--\r\n\r\n  “The first addresses to his Excellence the Lord General, &c., by John\r\n  Spittlehouse, a late Member of the Army, and a servant to the Saints\r\n  of the Most High God, &c. London, printed by J. C., for himself and\r\n  Richard Moon, at the Seven Stars, in Paul’s Churchyard, near the great\r\n  North Door. 1653.”\r\n\r\nAs a change upon the Seven Stars, a publican at Counterslip, Bristol,\r\nhas put up the FOURTEEN STARS.\r\n\r\nWe have seen (p. 492) that the sign of the STAR was “calculated for\r\nevery lewd purpose;” a great change certainly from mediæval times, when\r\na star was the emblem of the Holy Virgin, who was thus styled _Maris\r\nStella_ (star of the sea)--the signification of the name Miriam in\r\nHebrew--or _Stella Jacobi_, (star of Jacob,) _Stella Matutina_, (morning\r\nstar,) _Stella non erratica_, (fixed star, unerring star,) &c.; a star\r\nbeing always painted either on her right shoulder, or on her veil, as\r\nmay be readily observed in the works of the early Italian masters in our\r\nNational Gallery. A star of sixteen rays is the crest of the Innholders’\r\nCompany. Oliver Cromwell used to meet some of his party at the Star in\r\nColeman Street, as was deposed by one of the witnesses in the trial of\r\nHugh Peters:--\r\n\r\n  “_Gunter._ My Lord, I was servant at the Star in Coleman Street, with\r\n  one Hildesley. That house was a house where Oliver Cromwell and\r\n  several of that party did use to meet in consultation.”\r\n\r\nJohn Bunyan died in 1682 at the Star, on Snowhill, in the house of his\r\nfriend, Mr Strudwick, a grocer.\r\n\r\nThe POLE STAR is now a not uncommon sign. To make this device more\r\nintelligible, tavern-keepers ought to attach to it the motto it bore in\r\nthe middle ages, when it was a symbol of the Church: “_qui me non\r\naspicit errat_.” (He who does not look at me goes astray.) The STAR AND\r\nCROWN was the sign of a haberdasher in Princes Street, Coventry Street,\r\n1785, who, among other things, sold “dress and undress hoops.”\r\n\r\nThe signs of the zodiac appear occasionally to have been adopted by\r\nconjurors and astrologers. Ned Ward describes them as figuring, in his\r\ntime, on the door of “a star-peeper,” in Prescot Street.[705]\r\n\r\nThe TWO TWINS, or NAKED BOYS, was the sign of a quack in Moorfields,\r\n“near the steps going out of the Lower Field into the Middle Field.\r\nThere is a door above the steps, and another below the steps, with the\r\nTwins, and the name Langham on both doors;--keep the bill to prevent\r\nmistaking the house or being sent to a wrong place.”[706] To such\r\nlengthy explanations our ancestors were compelled to resort in the\r\nabsence of numbers on their houses. Either this quack had adopted the\r\nTwo Twins on account of his obstetrical pretensions, or he was an\r\nastrologer as well as a quack, for Moorfields was the head-quarters of\r\n\r\n  “Augurs and soothsayers, astrologers,\r\n  Diviners, and interpreters of dreams.”\r\n\r\nIn the last case he might have chosen it as being the ascendant of the\r\ncity of London, which “stands in a benign and temperate climate, in the\r\nlatitude of 52° and longitude of 19° 15´,--having (as artists reckon)\r\nthe _celestial twins_, the house of Mercury, patron of merchandise and\r\ningenious arts, for her ascendant.”[707]\r\n\r\nThe RAINBOW, in Fleet Street, opposite Chancery Lane, is the oldest\r\ncoffee-house in London:--\r\n\r\n  “I find it recorded that one James Farr, a barber, who kept the\r\n  coffee-house, which is now the Rainbow, by the Inner Temple gate, (one\r\n  of the first in England,) was, in the year 1657, presented by the\r\n  inquest of St Dunstan’s in the West, for making and selling a sort of\r\n  liquor called Coffee, as a great nuisance and prejudice to the\r\n  neighboorhood, &c., and who would have thought London would ever have\r\n  had near three thousand such nuisances, and that coffee would have\r\n  been (as now) so much drank by the best of quality and\r\n  physicians.”[708]\r\n\r\nThe presentation here alluded to is still preserved among the records of\r\nSt Sepulchre’s Church. It says:--\r\n\r\n  “We present James Farr, Barber, for making and selling a drink called\r\n  coffee, whereby, in making the same, he annoyeth his neighboors by\r\n  evill smells, and for keeping of fire the most part night and day,\r\n  whereby his chimney and chamber has been set on fire, to the great\r\n  danger and affreightment of his neighboors.”\r\n\r\nThis danger of fire was so much the greater, as a bookseller, Samuel\r\nSpeedal, had his shop in the same house. In 1682, the Phœnix Fire\r\nOffice, one of the first in this country, was established at this place.\r\n\r\nThe THUNDER STORM is the sign of a public-house at Framwellgate Moor,\r\nDurham; and the HAILSTONE, at Knowle, Staffordshire; both these houses\r\nmay have taken their names from a severe storm, which visited the\r\nneighbourhood at or about the time of their opening, just as the\r\nHAYLIFT, at Wansforth, Northampton, is said to owe its origin to the\r\nfact of a man floating a long way down the river on a haycock, during an\r\ninundation, and landing near that place.\r\n\r\nAs for the WILD SEA, the sign of John Horton, over against Parson’s\r\nBrewhouse, Croydon,[709] in 1718, no more plausible explanation occurs\r\nto us than that John Horton might have been a sailor in his younger\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe HOLE-IN-THE-WALL is believed to have originated from the hole made\r\nin the wall of the debtors’ or other prison, through which the poor\r\nprisoners received the money, broken meat, or other donations of the\r\ncharitably inclined. The old sign of the Hole-in-the-Wall (see our\r\nillustrations) shows such an opening in a square piece of brickwork.\r\nGenerally, it is believed to refer to some snug corner, perhaps near the\r\ntown walls; but at the old public-house in Chancery Lane the legend is\r\nas we have given it. Hard by, in Cursitor Street, prisoners for debt\r\nfound a temporary lodging up to a very recent date. Trades tokens are\r\nextant of this house, which, about 1820, was kept by Jack Randall,\r\n_alias_ Nonpareil, a famous member of the P.R.; on one occasion some\r\nverses were made containing the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  “Then blame me not, swells, kids, or lads of the fancy,\r\n  For opening a lush crib in _Chancery_ Lane,\r\n  An appropriate spot ’tis, you doubtless all can see,\r\n  Since _heads_ I’ve oft placed there, and let out again.”\r\n\r\nThe poet, Thomas Moore, in the fast days when George IV. was king, and\r\nwhen pugilism and gin drinking were fashionable accomplishments, used to\r\nvisit Mr Randall’s parlour. It was here that he picked up his materials\r\nfor those rhyming satires on the politics and general topics of his\r\ntime:--“Tom Crib’s Memorials to Congress, by one of the Fancy;”\r\n“Randall’s Diary of Proceedings at the House of Call for Genius;” “A Few\r\nSelections from Jack Randall’s Scrap Book, with Poems on the late Fight\r\nfor the Championship.”\r\n\r\nAt the Hole-in-the-Wall in Chandos Street, Claude Duval the highwayman\r\nwas taken prisoner; whilst the Hole-in-the-Wall in Baldwin’s Gardens was\r\nthe citadel in which Tom Brown used to intrench himself from duns and\r\nbailiffs, with Henry Purcell the musician, as his companion in revelry\r\nand merriment. Tom Brown’s introductory verses, prefixed to Playford’s\r\n“Musical Companion,” 1698, are dated “from Mr Stewart’s at the\r\nHole-in-the-Wall, in Baldwin’s Gardens.” Another Hole-in-the-Wall still\r\nexists in Kirby Street, Hatton Garden. It is a curious fact that the\r\nrefreshment-room, or liquor-bar, attached to the House of\r\nRepresentatives at Washington, is known to most thirsty American\r\npoliticians as _The Hole-in-the-Wall_.\r\n\r\nAnciently, instead of being a painted board, the object of the sign was\r\ncarved and hung within a hoop, hence (as we had occasion to remark on a\r\nformer page) nearly all the ancient signs are called the “---- ON THE\r\nHOOP.” In the Clause Roll, 43 Edward III., we find the GEORGE ON THE\r\nHOOP; 26 Henry VI., the HART ON THE HOOP; 30 Henry VI., the SWAN, the\r\nCOCK, and the HEN ON THE HOOP. Besides these we find mentioned the CROWN\r\nON THE HOOP, the BUNCH OF GRAPES ON THE HOOP, the MITRE ON THE HOOP, the\r\nANGEL ON THE HOOP, the FALCON ON THE HOOP, &c. In 1795, two of these\r\nsigns were still extant, for a periodical of the time says:--“A sign of\r\nthis nature is still preserved in Newport Street, and is a carved\r\nrepresentation of a Bunch of Grapes within a Hoop. The COCK ON THE HOOP\r\nmay be seen also in Holborn, painted on a board, to which, perhaps, it\r\nwas transferred on the removal of the sign-posts.”[710] These hoops seem\r\nto have originated in the highly ornamented bush or crown, which\r\nlatterly was made of hoops, covered with evergreens. In France, the HOOP\r\n(_le Cerceau_) was used as a sign. Jacques Androuet, a celebrated\r\narchitect, and author of a work entitled “Les plus excellents Batiments\r\nde France,” lived at the sign of the Hoop, whence he adopted the\r\nsurnames of Jacques Androuet du Cerceau. In 1570 he published a book on\r\nmetal-work, containing several designs for ornamental iron frames and\r\nposts to suspend signboards from. That names in this country also were\r\noccasionally derived from signboards, has been stated in our\r\nintroduction. Of this practice, Sir Peter Lely, the portrait painter,\r\nwas an illustrious example. He belonged to a Dutch family named Van der\r\nVaas. His grandfather was a perfumer, and lived at the sign of the Lily,\r\n(perhaps a _vase_ of lilies, with a pun on his name.) When his son\r\nentered the English army he discarded his Dutch name, and from the\r\npaternal sign, adopted the more euphonious one of Lilly or Lely; and\r\nthis name he and his children afterwards retained. The famous Rothschild\r\nfamily is another case in point. From the RED SHIELD (the _roth schild_)\r\nabove the door of an honest old Hebrew, in the Juden-gasse, (or Jews’\r\nAlley,) at Frankfort, has been derived the name of the richest family in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nThe HOOP AND BUNCH OF GRAPES was the sign of a public-house, in St\r\nAlbans Street, (now part of Waterloo Place,) kept at the beginning of\r\nthe present century, by the famous Matthew Skeggs, who obtained his\r\nrenown from playing, in the character of Signor Bumbasto, a concerto on\r\na broomstick, at the Haymarket Theatre, adjoining. His portrait was\r\npainted by King, a friend of Hogarth, engraved by Houston, and published\r\nby Skeggs himself. The HOOP AND GRIFFIN was a coffee-house in\r\nLeadenhall Street, _circa_ 1700;[711] and the HOOP AND TOY is a\r\npublic-house in Thurloe Place, Brompton. Here the original meaning of\r\nthe hoop seems entirely lost, as its combination with the toy seems to\r\nallude to the hoop trundled by children.\r\n\r\nThe TOY at Hampton used to be a favourite resort with the Londoners till\r\n1857, when it was pulled down to make room for private houses. Trades\r\ntokens of this house of the seventeenth century are extant. “In the\r\nsurvey of 1653 (in the Augmentation office) mention is made of a piece\r\nof pasture ground near the river, called the _Toying_ place, the site,\r\nprobably, of a well-known inn near the bridge now called the Toy.”[712]\r\n\r\nCardmakers usually took a card for their sign, as the QUEEN OF HEARTS\r\nAND KING’S ARMS, which was the sign of a cardmaker in Jermyn Street in\r\n1803.[713] One of the Bagford Bills has: “At the OLD KNAVE OF CLUBS at\r\nthe Bridgefoot, in Southwark, liveth Edward Butling, who maketh and\r\nselleth all sorts of hangings for rooms,” &c.[714] Possibly he sold also\r\nplaying-cards. These knaves, however, seem at one time to have been a\r\nbadge, for at the creation of seventeen knights of the Bath by Richard\r\nIII., the Duke of Buckingham was “richely appareled, and his horse\r\ntrapped in blue velvet embroudered with the _knaves of cartes_ burnyng\r\nof golde, which trapper was borne by foteman from the grounde.”[715] The\r\nQUEEN OF TRUMPS is a public-house sign at West Walton, near Wisbeach.\r\n\r\nThe HEART AND TRUMPET is a somewhat curious sign at Pentre-wern near\r\nOswestry, perhaps a corruption of Hearts and Trumps. Other games have\r\nproduced the sign of the GOLDEN QUOIT, in Whitehaven, and the CORNER\r\nPIN, which is so common that it figures in a Seven Dials ballad, a\r\nparody on the Low-back Car:--\r\n\r\n  “When first I saw Miss Bailey,\r\n    ’Twas on a Saturday,\r\n  At the _Corner Pin_ she was drinking gin,\r\n    And smoking a yard of clay,” &c.\r\n\r\nAll bowlers know that the corner pins are the most difficult to strike,\r\nand that from their fall with the rest depends whether the throw counts\r\ndouble or not.\r\n\r\nFormerly the merriest day of the year in “Merry England” was certainly\r\nthe first of May, but of its many festivities scarcely a trace is left\r\nexcept the dance of the sweeps and the sign of the MAYPOLE. Stubbe, with\r\npuritanical horror, thus describes the Maypole:--\r\n\r\n  “They have twenty or fourtie yoke of oxen, every one having a sweet\r\n  nosegay of flowers tyed on the tippe of his hornes, and these oxen\r\n  draw home this Maie pole (this stinckyng Idoll rather) which is\r\n  couered all ouer with flowers and hearbes bounde rounde aboute with\r\n  stringes, from the toppe to the bottome, and sometyme painted with\r\n  variable colours with two or three hundred men, women, and children\r\n  following it with great devotion. And thus being reared up with\r\n  handkerchiefs and flagges streaming on the toppe they strawe the\r\n  ground aboute, binde green boughes aboute it, sett up sommer houses,\r\n  Bowers, and Arbours hard by it. And then fall they to banquet and\r\n  feast, to leape and daunce aboute it, as the Heathen people did at the\r\n  dedication of their Idolles, whereof this is a perfect pattern, or\r\n  rather the thing itself.”[716]\r\n\r\nThe same author also reports that it was customary for lads and lasses\r\nto go the night before May-day to the hills and woodlands to gather\r\nbranches and flowers to deck the houses with on that day, and that they\r\nused to “spende all the night in pastymes” to the great detriment of\r\nfemale virtue; Featherstone, another sulky puritan, scandalised the fair\r\nsex by the assertion that “of tenne maydens which went to fetch May,\r\nnine of them came home with childe.”[717] The consequence of all this\r\ngrumbling was that the Maypole was abolished in the godly times of the\r\nCommonwealth, and as a matter of course, revived at the Restoration--but\r\nits prestige was gone. At present it is only commemorated by hundreds of\r\nsignboards. There is one on the outskirts of Hainault Forest,\r\nimmortalised in “Barnaby Rudge,” which has all the regulations of the\r\nhouse laid down in rhyme; part of these have been quoted on p. 449.\r\nThere is on the stable door:--\r\n\r\n  “Whosoever smokes tobacco here\r\n  Shall forfeit sixpence to spend in beer.\r\n  Your pipes lay by, when you come here,\r\n  Or fire to me may prove severe.”\r\n\r\nAn old, and not uncommon sign, is the WHEEL OF FORTUNE, which may be\r\nseen at Alpington, Norwich, and in other places. This wheel is sometimes\r\nrepresented with four kings, one on each quadrant. In the middle ages\r\nit was a very common symbol, as well in England as on the continent,\r\nbeing frequently painted in churches; there is one still to be seen\r\namong the half obliterated frescoes of Catfield church in Norfolk. Other\r\ninstances occur in the church of St Etienne, at Beauvais; in St Martin,\r\nat Basle; in San Zeno, at Verona; and in the beautiful pavement of the\r\nDuomo, at Sienna. Not only in those countries, but all over Europe, this\r\ndevice occurs as a sign. Peacham thus accounts for the wheel being\r\nchosen as the emblem of Fortune:--\r\n\r\n  “For like ourselves, the spoke that was on high\r\n  Is to the bottom in a moment cast,\r\n  As fast the lowest riseth by and by,\r\n  All human things thus find a change at last.”\r\n\r\n  _Peacham’s Minerva Brittana_, p. 76.\r\n\r\nThe MONSTER, at one period an inn of some resort in Willow Walk,\r\nChelsea, now a starting-point for the Pimlico omnibuses, is perhaps a\r\ncorruption of the Monastery. Robert de Heyle in 1368 leased the whole of\r\nthe manor of Chelsea to the abbot and convent of Westminster for the\r\nterm of his own life, for which they were to allow him a certain house\r\nwithin the convent for his residence, to pay him the sum of £20 per\r\nannum, to provide him every day two white loaves, two flagons of convent\r\nale, and once a year a robe of esquire’s silk. At this period, or\r\nshortly after, the sign of the Monastery may have been set up, to be\r\nhanded down from generation to generation, until the meaning and proper\r\npronunciation were forgotten, and it became “the Monster.” In still\r\nolder times, viz., during the Norman rule, Chelsea appears to have been\r\none of the manors of Westminster, so that the connexion between the\r\nvillage of Chelsea and the monastery of Westminster had been of very old\r\nstanding. This tavern, we believe, is the only one with such a sign. Ned\r\nWard mentions a GREEN MONSTER tavern in Prescott Street, but that may\r\nhave been one of Ned’s jokes on the very common Green Dragon. The tavern\r\nin question was a very unlucky house, and not less than three or four\r\nlandlords had failed in it, which was not to be wondered at, for the\r\nstreet appears at that time to have been one of the soberest in London.\r\nAccording to Ned, one “would walk by forty or fifty houses and not an\r\nalehouse.”[718]\r\n\r\nThe MILLION GARDENS, Strutton Ground, Westminster, was the singular\r\nname of the house where tickets might be obtained for a lottery of plate\r\nin 1718.[719] The name in reality refers to the “Melon Gardens,” which\r\nfruit was pronounced after the signboard orthography in the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nPepys, on the 3d of August 1660, informs us that he dined at an ordinary\r\ncalled the QUAKER, a somewhat unusual godfather for a sinful tavern.\r\nThis house was situated in the Great Sanctuary, Westminster, and was\r\nonly pulled down in the beginning of the present century to make way for\r\na market-place, which in its turn has made room for a new\r\nsessions-house. Tull, the last landlord, opened a new public-house in\r\nThieving Lane, and adorned the doorway of this house with twisted\r\npillars decorated with vine-leaves, brought from the old Quaker tavern.\r\nJ. T. Smith presents us with a view of this house in the additional\r\nplates to his “Antiquities of Westminster.”\r\n\r\nThe PILGRIM has been mentioned incidentally (on p. 434) as a sign at\r\nCoventry. There is another public-house of this name in Kew Lane. In\r\n1833 a figure of a pilgrim was placed upon the roof of this house, which\r\nby concealed machinery moved to and fro like the Wandering Jew, doomed\r\nto wander up and down until the end of the world; it was, however, of\r\ncontemptible workmanship, and very soon got out of order.\r\n\r\nThe GIPSY’S TENT occurs at Hagley, Stourbridge; the GIPSY QUEEN at\r\nHighbury and other places; and the QUEEN OF THE GIPSIES was the sign of\r\nthe so-called gipsy house near Norwood. The queen alluded to was\r\nMargaret Finch, who died at the great age of 109 years; Norwood was her\r\nresidence during the last years of her life, and there she told fortunes\r\nto the credulous. She was buried October 24, 1760, in a deep square box,\r\nas from her constant habit of sitting with her chin resting on her\r\nknees, her muscles had become so contracted that she could not at last\r\nalter her position. This woman, when a girl of seventeen, may have been\r\none of the dusky gang pretty Mrs Pepys and her companions went to\r\nconsult, August 11, 1668, which her lord duly chronicled in the evening:\r\n“This afternoon my wife and Mercer and Deb went with Pelling to see the\r\ngypsies at Lambeth, and have their fortunes told, but what they did I\r\ndid not enquire.” A granddaughter of Margaret Finch, also a so-styled\r\nqueen, was living in an adjoining cottage in the year 1800.\r\n\r\nThe TRUE LOVER’S KNOT is a sign at Uxbridge, the only example of it we\r\nhave met with. In the North of England and in Scotland it is still the\r\ncustom with betrothed lovers of the lower class to present each other\r\nwith a curious kind of knot called “a true lover’s knot.” Brand says the\r\nword is not derived from true love, but from trulofa, Danish for _fidem\r\ndo_. It was formerly a common present between lovers of all stations of\r\nlife in England.\r\n\r\nThe FOLLY is not unusual; it is generally applied to a very ambitious,\r\nextravagantly furnished, or highly ornamented house; in such a sense it\r\nwas already used in Queen Elizabeth’s reign:--\r\n\r\n  “Kirby Castle and _Fisher’s Folly_\r\n  Spinola’s Pleasure and Megse’s Glory.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most notorious “Follies” was an edifice of timber divided\r\ninto sundry rooms, with a platform and balustrade on the top, which in\r\nthe reign of Charles II. floated in the Thames above London Bridge. At\r\nfirst it was very well frequented, and the beauty and fashion of the\r\nperiod (Pepys amongst them, April 13, 1668,) used to go there on summer\r\nevenings, partake of refreshments on the platform, and enjoy the breeze\r\non the river (then guiltless of the modern sewers and filth.). On one\r\noccasion Queen Mary honoured it with a visit, accompanied by some of her\r\ncourtiers. Gradually, however, it took to evil courses; loose and\r\ndisorderly females were admitted, and unrestrained drinking and dancing\r\nsoon gave it an unenviable notoriety. In this condition it was visited\r\nby Tom Brown, who describes it with his usual coarse vigour: “This\r\nwhimsical piece of Architecture was designed as a musical Summer-house\r\nfor the entertainment of quality where they might meet and ogle one\r\nanother; but the Ladies of the Town finding it as convenient a\r\nrendez-vous, overstock’d the place with such an inundation of harlotry,\r\nthat dashed the female quality out of countenance, and made them seek\r\nsome more retired conveniency.” He next describes the company in very\r\nglowing colours, but found it such a confused scene of folly, madness,\r\nand debauchery, that he--no very bashful person--was compelled to return\r\nto his boat “_without drinking_!”[720] At length the place became so\r\nscandalous that it had to be closed; it went to decay, and at last was\r\nsold for firewood.\r\n\r\nThe sign of the BLUE-COAT BOY, usually chosen by toy-shops,\r\nprintsellers, and colourmen, was either in compliment to the scholars of\r\nKing Edward VI.’s foundation, Christ’s Hospital,--commonly called “the\r\nBlue Coat School,” from the blue tunic of the lads, or was named after\r\nthe Bridewell Boys, _i.e._, foundlings and deserted children, who wore a\r\nblue coat and trousers, with a white hat. Until the end of the last\r\ncentury they used to attend at all the fires with the Bridewell engine,\r\nbut on the whole they were an unruly mischievous set. There was a BLUE\r\nCOAT coffee-house in Sweeting’s Alley, near the Exchange, in 1711.[721]\r\nAt present it is generally called the BLUE BOY, as at Old Swinford,\r\nStourbridge; Minchinhampton, Gloucester, and in a few other places. In\r\nIslington there is still such a sign, and in Aldersgate Street, if we\r\nremember rightly, there is an ironmonger with such a decoration.\r\n\r\nA very strange sign occurs amongst the Banks Bills. On a shop-bill dated\r\n1698, is the following inscription: “At the signe of the TARE lives one\r\nMr Grenier who makes all sorts of good rasors, lancets, sisers, very\r\nwell, and all other sorts of instruments for chirugeons.” The engraving\r\nrepresents two angels holding a _tear_ by a string, surrounded by a\r\nquantity of surgical instruments, after the true meat-axe type, and\r\nvicious-looking enough to “draw tears of molten brass from the eyes of\r\nPluto himself.”\r\n\r\nThe WEARY TRAVELLER occurs at Sutton Road, Kidderminster; the\r\nTRAVELLER’S REST in a great many places, sometimes accompanied by the\r\nphrase REST AND BE THANKFUL, which last advice serves as a sign to two\r\npublic-houses at Whitehaven. Finally the FINISH was the sign of a\r\nnotorious night-house in Covent Garden, kept at the beginning of the\r\npresent century by a Mrs Butler. Here, according to “Tom Crib’s Memorial\r\nto Congress,” the gentlemen of the road used to divide their spoil in\r\nthe gray dawn of the morning, when it was time for the night-birds to\r\nfly to their roost. Crib (in reality Thomas Moore the poet, see p. 503)\r\nsays that the congress is:--\r\n\r\n  “Some place that’s like the _Finish_, lads,\r\n  Where all your high pedestrian pads\r\n  That have been _up_ and _out_ all night,\r\n    Running their rigs amongst the rattlers,[722]\r\n  At morning meet, and, honour bright,\r\n    Agree to share the blunt and tatlers.”\r\n\r\nThis house was originally named the Queen’s Head, but was nicknamed the\r\n_Finish_ from its being the place where the fast men of the day\r\ngenerally “finished off.” Ned Shuter was at one time a drawer in this\r\nhouse, but, inspired by the neighbourhood of the theatres, he left the\r\npots and bottles and took to the stage. Down to a recent date it was a\r\ngloomy disreputable coffee-house, kept by one Smith, and here, in\r\ninterdicted hours, beer and spirits could be obtained when all the\r\npublic-houses were closed. It was pulled down very recently. These last\r\nfour signs have in a measure been the expression of the authors’ minds:\r\nwho, weary of their long task, and fearful of having fatigued their\r\nreaders, will now betake themselves to _rest_, and _be thankful_ if they\r\nhave given a few hours’ entertainment upon the subject of signboards.\r\nThey now take their leave in the words of an old ballad:--\r\n\r\n  “Then faire fall all good tokens,\r\n  And well fare a good heart,\r\n  For by all _signs_ and _tokens_\r\n  ’Tis time for to depart.”\r\n\r\n[671] Burnet’s Own Times, vol. ii., p. 426, ed. 1823.\r\n\r\n[672] Harl.

Admiral Beaumont was shipwrecked and lost with\r\nnearly the whole of his ship’s company. The Eddystone lighthouse was\r\nblown down and swallowed by the sea, with its architect, Mr Henry\r\nWinstanley. A sermon is still yearly preached at Little Wild Street\r\nBaptist Chapel, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, in memory of this fearful storm, a\r\nMr John Taylor, bookseller of Paternoster Row, having left £40 to it as\r\na thank-offering for his miraculous preservation at the time of the\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\n[680] After having been for a long time one of the most secure\r\nstrongholds of the devil, a godly garrison was sent into Moorfields at\r\nthe end of the last century. The _Gazetteer_, 10th September 1790, has\r\nthe following paragraph:--“So numerous are become the _Gospel shops_ in\r\nthe vicinity of Moorfields, that like Monmouth Street, the proprietors\r\nemploy “pluckers in” on Sundays to inveigle customers. The cant phrase\r\nat the door is, “Good sound doctrine here in perfection.””\r\n\r\n[681] _Postboy_, Jan. 1, 1711-12.\r\n\r\n[682] Advertisements in the _Weekly Journal_ for that year.\r\n\r\n[683] Both named in the _Daily Courant_ for 1718.\r\n\r\n[684] _London Gazette_, Nov. 18-21, 1700.\r\n\r\n[685] Tour to London, vol i., p. 84. “A perfectly fair judge, and\r\nwriting in the true spirit of a philosopher,” says his translator.\r\nGrosley remarks that the foreigners would be in the wrong to complain of\r\nthe rude insults of the lower classes, since even “the better sort of\r\nLondoners” liberally show their hatred to the French whenever they can\r\nfind an opportunity.\r\n\r\n[686] Banks Bills, dated 1787.\r\n\r\n[687] “New View of London.” 1708, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[688] Dr Lardner’s Arithmetic, p. 44.\r\n\r\n[689] Allen’s History of Lambeth.\r\n\r\n[690] Siege of Carlaeverock, c. 11:--\r\n\r\n            “--on li respont\r\n  De grosses pierres et _cornues_.”\r\n\r\n[691] _London Gazette_, April 29-May 2, 1700.\r\n\r\n[692] Printed in Nichols’s Illustrations of Manners and Expenses in\r\nAncient Times, 1797.\r\n\r\n[693] Tom Brown’s Amusements for the Meridian of London, p. 71.\r\n\r\n[694] _Country Journal or Craftsman_, Feb. 1, 1734-5.\r\n\r\n[695] _Postman_, 1711.\r\n\r\n[696] Aubrey, Remains of Gentilisme and Judaisme.

The Virtuosi will have a new Opportunity\r\n  of displaying their Taste on this Occasion, by discovering the\r\n  different _Stile_ of the several Masters employed, and pointing out by\r\n  what _Hand_ each Piece is drawn. A remarkable _Cognoscente_ who has\r\n  attended at the Society’s great Room, _with his Glass_, for several\r\n  Mornings, has already piqued himself on discovering the famous Painter\r\n  of the _Rising Sun_, a modern _Claude Lorraine_, in an elegant\r\n  Night-piece of the _Man-in-the-Moon_. He is also convinced that no\r\n  other than the famous Artists who drew the _Red Lion at Brentford_,\r\n  can be equal to the bold figures in the _London ‘Prentice_, and that\r\n  the exquisite Colouring in the Piece called Pyramus and Thisbe must be\r\n  by the same hand as the _Hole-in-the-Wall_.”\r\n\r\nShortly after this advertisement, the Exhibition was opened. It was held\r\nin Bonnell Thornton’s chambers in Bow Street: the hours were from nine\r\ntill four, admission one shilling. The tickets had a catalogue prefixed\r\nto them. The names of the signboard-painters given in this catalogue\r\nwere those of the journeymen printers in Mr Baldwin’s office, where it\r\nwas printed. Hagarty alone was a transparent variation on the name of\r\nHogarth, who had largely contributed to the fun and humour of the\r\nExhibition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.\r\n\r\nTHREE NUNS.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1814.)\r\n\r\nABEL DRUGGER.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1780.)\r\n\r\nWELSH TROOPER.\r\n\r\n(From an old print, 1750.)\r\n\r\nELEPHANT AND CASTLE.\r\n\r\n(Belle Sauvage Yard, circa 1668.)\r\n\r\nBLACK PRINCE.\r\n\r\n(Banks’s Collection, 1790.)]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the saloons was the signal for a perfect storm among the\r\nnewspapers. The artists and their friends were terribly ruffled, and\r\npersisted in seeing in it a _persifflage_ of their exhibition just then\r\nopened in the Strand. To this animosity, however, we owe all the\r\nparticulars of the signs exhibited. Catalogues, criticisms, and reviews\r\nof the Exhibition were daily brought before the public, giving full\r\ndetails. The most important of them we present to our readers:--\r\n\r\n  BY PERMISSION.\r\n\r\n  A CATALOGUE _of the Original Paintings, Busts, Carved Figures, &c.,\r\n  &c., &c., Now exhibiting by the Society of Sign-Painters, at the Large\r\n  Rooms, the Upper End of Bow Street, Covent Garden, nearly opposite the\r\n  Play-House Passage_.\r\n\r\n  _In the Large Passage Room._\r\n\r\n  [_N.B._--That the Merit of the Modern Masters may be fairly examined\r\n  into, it has been thought proper to place some admired Works of the\r\n  most eminent Old Masters in this Room, and along the Passage thro’ the\r\n  Yard.]\r\n\r\n  No.\r\n\r\n  1. [_Over the Door._] A Coach and Four, Supposed to be by _Stanhope_.\r\n\r\n  2. WINDSOR, or any other CASTLE. By _Mason_. The CENTINEL and GREAT\r\n  GUN by another Hand.\r\n\r\n  3. HAND and LOCK OF HAIR. Hand unknown.\r\n\r\n  4. A PANDOUR, or INDIAN PRINCE, uncertain which. _Stanhope’s_\r\n  undoubtedly.\r\n\r\n  5. A SHIP AND CASTLE. _Thomas Knife_ written under. But it is not\r\n  known whether this is the name of the Artist or the Publican.\r\n\r\n  6. A HEN AND CHICKENS. By _Lodge_.\r\n\r\n  7. THREE NUNS. The Drapery copied from a _Bas-Relief_ at Rome.

A BARGE, in Still-Life. By _Van der Trout_.

The HERCULES PILLARS. The Architecture by _Young Soames_. THE\r\n  FIGURE (from the _Farnesian Hercules_) by the _Father_.\r\n\r\n  12. An HEROE’S HEAD, unknown. By _Moses White_.

An Original Half Length of CAMDEN, the great Historian and\r\n  Antiquary, in his Herald’s Coat. By _Van der Trout_.

They intend theirs as only an Appendix, or (in the\r\n  Stile of Painters) a Companion to the others. There is nothing in\r\n  their Collection, which will be understood by any Candid Person as a\r\n  Reflection on any Body, or any Body of Men. They are not in the least\r\n  prompted by any mean Jealousy to depreciate the Merits of their\r\n  Brother Artists. Animated by the same Public Spirit, their sole View\r\n  is to convince Foreigners as well as their own blinded Countrymen,\r\n  that however inferior this Nation may be unjustly deemed in other\r\n  Branches of the Polite Arts, the Palm for SIGN-PAINTING must be\r\n  universally ceded to US, the _Dutch_ themselves not excepted.]\r\n\r\n  1. PORTRAIT of a justly celebrated PAINTER, though an Englishman and a\r\n  Modern.\r\n\r\n  2. A CROOKED BILLET, formed exactly in the _Line of Beauty_,[724] its\r\n  Companion.

The\r\n  Busts, carved Figures, &c., are of corresponding Excellence, all of\r\n  them being the very worst of Signpost Work, and such as seem collected\r\n  for an Insult on the Human understanding.\r\n\r\n  “But that your Readers may _All_ save their Time, Money, and Credit,\r\n  by not falling into this Hum-trap, I shall give them an Account of\r\n  some of the choicest Articles of this Collection as a sample that must\r\n  damp their Curiosity for seeing the Whole.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  GRAND ROOM.\r\n\r\n  1.

If there is any Satyre in this\r\n  Design, it must be in humming their Customers. Wit or taste there is\r\n  certainly none; but there is a Magnitude of Imposition that is surely\r\n  deserving of Punishment.\r\n\r\n  It is well known that the Society for the Encouragement of Arts,\r\n  Manufactures, and Commerce, are at a great Expense for making their\r\n  elegant Exhibition, and give their Tickets all away. The Artists,\r\n  indeed, sell Catalogues there to those who chuse to buy them, and\r\n  dispose of the Money that is got by them to Charities.\r\n\r\n  The Body of Artists made their Catalogues Tickets to serve last year\r\n  for the whole Time of Exhibition in Spring Gardens, and sold them but\r\n  a shilling a-piece, the Profits of which were likewise distributed in\r\n  Charities.\r\n\r\n  The Society, as they call themselves, of Signpainters, or rather of\r\n  Bites who borrow that Name, have the Assurance to fix a Ticket to each\r\n  Catalogue, which they sell for their own Profit at a shilling; and, by\r\n  obliging the Ticket to be torn off at the Second Door, make the\r\n  Purchase of a New Catalogue absolutely necessary for a Second\r\n  Admission. It is true most Gentlemen do refuse to let their Catalogues\r\n  be torn; and many of those who had submitted to the tearing of them,\r\n  insisted upon their being exchanged for whole ones, resolving, like\r\n  Men of Spirit, not to be bubbled every Way.\r\n\r\n  In fine, this Mock Exhibition is a most impudent and scandalous Abuse\r\n  and Bubble. An Insult on Understanding, and a most pickpocket\r\n  Imposture. The best entertainment it can afford is that of standing in\r\n  the street, and observing with how much shame in their Faces People\r\n  come out of the House. Pity it will be, if all who are employed in the\r\n  carrying on this Cheat, are not seized and sent to serve the King. And\r\n  those who are Sharers in the Booty deserve likewise to be severely\r\n  chastised.\r\n\r\n  I am, SIR, yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n  A DESPISER OF ALL TRICKERY.”\r\n\r\n  “_The_ Signpainters _return their Thanks to the author of the above\r\n  most excellent Letter, which is seemingly abusive of their Design, but\r\n  is in Fact a most admirable Irony._\r\n\r\n  _The_ LEDGER _of this Morning, after having pillaged the_ CATALOGUE OF\r\n  SIGNPAINTING, _is candid enough to abuse it. But it is plain that the\r\n  author has not seen the Exhibition, or could not find out the Humour\r\n  of it._”\r\n\r\n  FROM THE GAZETTEER.--(_St James’ Chronicle_, Ap. 24-27, 1762.)--“The\r\n  Society of Signpainters, in their Catalogue, tell us they _take the\r\n  opportunity of refuting_ what they are pleased to call a _malicious\r\n  Suggestion_--viz., ‘Their Exhibition being designed as a Ridicule on\r\n  the Exhibition of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, etc., and\r\n  the Artists,’ and that they intend theirs only as an Appendix or (in\r\n  the Style of Painters) ‘Companion’ to the others. What is that but\r\n  ridiculing, or an attempt towards it? They say ‘there is nothing in\r\n  their Collection which will be understood by any candid person as a\r\n  Reflection on any Body or any Body of Men.’ They might have spared\r\n  this Assertion, for no Person, endued with the least Share of common\r\n  Sense, can imagine so impotent and futile an Attempt at Satire or\r\n  Ridicule on any Thing except the few Spectators who go there; which\r\n  would have been better understood had it opened on the First of April.\r\n\r\n  “They also say, ‘They are not in the least prompted by any mean\r\n  jealousy to depreciate the Merits of their Brother Artists.’ Which is\r\n  owing to their Inability, not want of Assurance; for an Attempt in\r\n  them to depreciate the Merit of the Professors of Painting and\r\n  Sculpture, whom they are impudently pleased to call their Brother\r\n  Artists, would be (to borrow a Simile from one of their own\r\n  Productions) like Dogs barking at the Moon.\r\n\r\n  “_Their sole View_, etc., etc.--‘Their sole View’ (without any Breach\r\n  of Charity) we may infer is that of filling their own Pockets by\r\n  duping the Publick; for no private Men would by an Advertisement\r\n  invite People to their House, and place a Porter at the Door to take a\r\n  Shilling of them, with a Pretence of being animated by a public\r\n  Spirit, for any other Motive.\r\n\r\n  “_Bow Street, Covent Garden, April 27._\r\n\r\n  “_The Society of_ SIGN-PAINTERS are obliged to the GAZETTEER for the\r\n  _above Remarks_.”\r\n\r\nArticles and letters abusive of the Exhibition appeared in most of the\r\nnewspapers, and not a day passed but it was attacked in no very measured\r\nterms. The committee, however, generally reprinted the articles in their\r\nown organ, thanking the critics for so successfully advertising their\r\nefforts, after which no more was heard from them. The following review,\r\nhaving very similar annotations upon the signs to those in the letter\r\nsigned “_A Despiser of all Trickery_,” may have come from one of their\r\nown pens. It appeared in a monthly sheet, entitled, “_The London\r\nRegister_,” for April:[734]--\r\n\r\n  “Humour is confessedly one of the chief characteristics of the English\r\n  nation. There is no Country that delights in it so much, exerts it on\r\n  such various occasions, or shows it in so many Shapes. In\r\n  conversation, in Books, on the Stage, we meet with it every Day; and\r\n  it has sometimes been introduced, not without success, even into the\r\n  Pulpit. To an Artist of our own Country, and of our own Times, we owe\r\n  the Practice of enriching Pictures with Humour, Character, Pleasantry,\r\n  and Satire. Such an Artist could not fail of Applause in such a Nation\r\n  as ours, and his Fame is equal to his Merit.\r\n\r\n  The original Paintings, etc., the Catalogue of which now lies before\r\n  us, are the Project of a well-known Gentleman, in whose house they are\r\n  exhibited; a Gentleman who has, in several instances, displayed a\r\n  most uncommon Vein of Humour. His Burlesque Ode on St Cecilia’s\r\n  Day,[735] his Labours in the _Drury Lane Journal_, and other papers,\r\n  all possess that singular Turn of Imagination so peculiar to himself.\r\n  This Gentleman is perhaps the only Person in England (if we except the\r\n  Artist above mentioned) who could have projected, or have carried\r\n  tolerably into Execution, this scheme of a Grand Exhibition. There is\r\n  a whimsical drollery in all his Plans, and a Comical Originality in\r\n  his Manner, that never fail to distinguish and to recommend all his\r\n  Undertakings. To exercise his Wit and Humour in an innocent Laugh, and\r\n  to raise that innocent Laugh in others, seems to have been his chief\r\n  Aim in the present Spectacle. The Ridicule or Exhibition, if it must\r\n  be accounted so, is pleasant without Malevolence; and the general\r\n  Strokes on the common Topics of Satire are given with the most\r\n  apparent Good-humour. . . . . .\r\n\r\n  On entering the Grand Room, . . . . you find yourself in a large and\r\n  commodious Apartment, hung round with green Bays, on which this\r\n  curious collection of Wooden Originals is fixt flat, (like the Signs\r\n  at present in Paris,) and from whence hang Keys, Bells, Swords, Poles,\r\n  Sugar-Loaves, Tobacco-Rolls, Candles, and other ornamental Furniture,\r\n  carved in Wood, that commonly dangle from the Penthouses of the\r\n  different Shops in our streets. On the Chimney-Board (to imitate the\r\n  Stile of the Catalogue) is a large, blazing Fire, painted in\r\n  Water-colours; and within a kind of Cupola, or rather Dome, which lets\r\n  the Light into the Room, is written in Golden Capitals, upon a blue\r\n  Ground, a Motto from Horace, disposed in the Form following:--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  From this short Description of the Grand-Room, (when we consider the\r\n  singular Nature of the Paintings themselves, and the Peculiarity of\r\n  the other Decorations,) it may be easily imagined that no Connoisseur,\r\n  who has made the Tour of Europe, ever entered a Picture-Gallery that\r\n  struck his Eye more forcibly at first Sight, or provoked his Attention\r\n  with more extraordinary Appearance.\r\n\r\n  We will now, if the Reader pleases, conduct him round the Room, and\r\n  take a more accurate Survey of the curious Originals before us. To\r\n  which End we shall proceed to transcribe the ingenious Society’s\r\n  Catalogue, adding (as we proposed before) such Notes and Illustrations\r\n  as may seem necessary for his Instruction or Entertainment.\r\n\r\n  8. _The Vicar of Bray: The Portrait of a Beneficed Clergyman, at Full\r\n  Length._ [The vicar of Bray is an Ass in a Feather-topped Grizzle,\r\n  Band, and Pudding Sleeves.--This is a much droller Conceit, and has\r\n  more Effect when executed, than the old Design of The Ass loaded with\r\n  Preferment.]\r\n\r\n  9. _The Irish Arms. By Patrick O’Blaney._ [_N.B. Captain Terence\r\n  O’Cutter stood for them._] [A Pair of extremely thick Legs in white\r\n  Stockings and black Garters.]\r\n\r\n  12. _The Scotch Fiddle. By M^{c}Pharson, done from Himself._ [The\r\n  Figure of a Highlander sitting under a Tree, and enjoying that\r\n  greatest of Pleasure of _scratching where it itches_.]\r\n\r\n  16. _A Man._ [Nine Taylors at Work; in Allusion to the old Saying of\r\n  _nine Taylors make a Man_.]\r\n\r\n  19. _Nobody, alias Somebody._ A Character. [The Figure of an Officer,\r\n  all Head, Arms, Legs and Thighs.--This Piece has a very odd Effect,\r\n  being so drolly executed that you don’t miss the Body.]\r\n\r\n  20. _Somebody, alias Nobody. A Caricature. Its Companion. Both these\r\n  by Hagarty._ [A rosy figure with a little Head and a huge Body, whose\r\n  Belly swags over, almost quite down to his Shoe-Buckles. By the Staff\r\n  in his Hand it appears to be intended to represent a Constable.--It\r\n  might also have been mistaken for an eminent Justice of Peace.]\r\n\r\n  22. _The Strugglers. A Conversation. By Bransley._ [Represents a Man\r\n  and Wife fighting for the Breeches.]\r\n\r\n  23. _A Free-Mason’s Lodge, or the Impenetrable Secret. By a Sworn\r\n  Brother._ [The supposed Ceremony and probable Consequences of what is\r\n  called _making a Mason_, representing the Master of the Lodge with a\r\n  red hot Salamander in his Hand, and the new Brother blindfold, and in\r\n  a comical Situation of _Fear and Good-Luck_.]\r\n\r\n  25. _A Man running away with the Monument. By Whitaker._ [This Picture\r\n  of a London Night, like the Farmer Returned, represents\r\n\r\n  ---- the Watchmen in Town,\r\n  Lame, feeble, half blind.----\r\n\r\n  Two of these Cripples are pursuing the Thief, one crying out, Stop\r\n  Thief! and the other, I can’t catch him.]\r\n\r\n  27. _The Spirit of Contradiction. Ditto. By Hagarty._ [Two Brewers\r\n  with a Barrel of Beer, pulling different Ways.]\r\n\r\n  28. _The Logger Heads. Ditto. By Ditto._ [Underwritten, the old Joke\r\n  of _We are Three_. Shakespeare plainly alludes to this sign in his\r\n  Twelfth Night, where the Fool comes between Sir Toby Belch and Sir\r\n  Andrew Aguecheek, and, taking each by the Hand, says, “How now, my\r\n  Hearts, did you never see the Picture of _We Three_?”]\r\n\r\n  30. _The Dancing Bears. By Hagarty._ [Most drolly conceived and\r\n  comically executed.--Represents Four Bears on their hind Legs, drest\r\n  in different Characters, one with a gold Chain round his Neck, giving\r\n  Right Paw and Left, gravely practising Country-Dances, under the\r\n  Tuition of a Monkey, drest like a Dancing-Master, and fiddling on a\r\n  KIT-ten.--The Seriousness and Solemnity of each of these Figures is\r\n  incomparable. Underneath is written, “Grown Gentlemen taught to\r\n  Dance.”]\r\n\r\n  31. _Band Box. By Sympson._ [Hieroglyphically expressed . . . . an Ass\r\n  standing in a Bandbox.]\r\n\r\n  33. _St John’s Head in a Charger._ [The dead Saint’s Eyes, like those\r\n  in most Portraits, seem to be looking at you.]\r\n\r\n  35. _A Man in his Element. A Sign for an Eating-House._ [A Cook\r\n  roasted upon a Spit at the Kitchen-Fire and basted by the Devil.]\r\n\r\n  36. _A Man out of his Element._ [A Sailor fallen off his Horse, with\r\n  his Skull lighting against the ten mile Stone from Portsmouth.]\r\n\r\n  38. _A Bird in the Hand, a Landscape. By Allison._ [A common sign in\r\n  various Parts of England, which has usually this Inscription,\r\n\r\n  A Bird in Hand is better far\r\n  Than two that in the Bushes are.\r\n\r\n  But these Lines are much improved in the Inscription that is under\r\n  this Sign in the Exhibition:\r\n\r\n  A Bird in Hand far better ’tis\r\n  Than two that in the Bushes is.]\r\n\r\n  39. _Absalon Hanging, a Peruke Maker’s Sign. By Sclater._ [Underneath\r\n  is written--\r\n\r\n  If Absalon had not worn his own Hair\r\n  Absalon had not been hanging there.]\r\n\r\n  40. _Welcome Cuckholds to Horn-Fair. By Hagarty._ [Whimsically\r\n  imagined, and drolly executed--Being a Picture of Horn-Fair containing\r\n  various Figures of Cuckholds in different Characters; some with large\r\n  staring Bulls’, Goats’-Horns, &c., others with their Horns just\r\n  budding. The center Figure is that of a fine Gentleman (copied from\r\n  the fine Gentleman in Lethe) with Rams’-Horns. On a Bank, fast asleep,\r\n  sits a Citizen-like Figure, with large branching antlers, and on the\r\n  other side of the Picture, is a jemmy Figure in Boots, who has no\r\n  Horns upon his Head, but carries them in his Pocket, out of which the\r\n  tops appear tipt with Gold. This last Gentleman’s Horse (to make the\r\n  Picture complete) is also represented as a Cuckhold, having a Horn in\r\n  his Forehead like an Unicorn’s.]\r\n\r\n  49. _An Ha! Ha!_\r\n\r\n  50 [_On a parallel Line with the foregoing on the other Side of the\r\n  Chimney_] _The Curiosity, its Companion._ [_These two by an unknown\r\n  Hand, the Exhibitors being favoured with them from an unknown\r\n  Quarter._] ⁂ _Ladies and Gentlemen are requested not to finger them,\r\n  as blue Curtains are hung over in purpose to preserve them._ [Behind\r\n  the blue Curtains on one of these Boards is written _Ha! Ha! Ha!_ and\r\n  on the other _He! He! He!_ At the first opening of the Exhibition the\r\n  Ladies had infinite Curiosity to know what was behind the Curtain, but\r\n  were afraid to gratify it. This _covered Laugh_ is no bad satire on\r\n  the indecent Pictures in some Collections, hung up in the same Manner\r\n  with Curtains over them.]\r\n\r\n  52. [_Over the Chimney_] _The Renowned Seven Champions of Christendom,\r\n  from an entire New Design._ [A Capital Piece. The Seven Champions are\r\n  represented in the following Manner. 1. St George is an English Sailor\r\n  mounted on a Lion, with a Spit (by Way of Lance) bearing a Sirloin of\r\n  Beef in one Hand, and a full Pot of Porter marked _only Three Pence a_\r\n  QUART in the other. By the Lion’s Foot are two Scrolls, like Ballads,\r\n  the one inscribed O the Roast Beef of Old England: the other, Hearts\r\n  of Oak are our Men. 2. St Andrew is a Highlander mounted on a Scotch\r\n  Galloway, with a Broad Sword, bearing an Oat Cake at the End of it in\r\n  one Hand, and a Flask of Whisky in the other. 3. St Dennis is a\r\n  Frenchman, mounted on a Deer, a timorous swift-footed Animal with a\r\n  small Sword in one Hand on which a Frog appears to be spitted, and a\r\n  Dish of Soupe Maigre in the other. 4. St Anthony is the Pope, mounted\r\n  on a _Bull_, with a Crosier and a Vessel of Holy Water dangling from\r\n  it, in one Hand, and a Cod-Fish inscribed Food for Lent in the other.\r\n  From his Right Foot hangs a Scroll inscribed Kiss my Toe, and on the\r\n  Ground several Rolls of Paper, on which are written, Pardons,\r\n  Indulgencies, &c. &c. 5. St James is a Spaniard mounted on a Mule with\r\n  an Ingot of Gold in one Hand and a _Padlock_ in the other. 6. St David\r\n  is Taffy mounted on a Goat brandishing a Leek in one Hand, and bearing\r\n  a Cheese, by Way of Target, in the other. 7. St Patrick is an Irish\r\n  Soldier, mounted on a large Stone-Horse, at whose Feet is a kind of\r\n  Bill with this Inscription--To cover this Season Black and All Black.\r\n  He has a Sword, bearing a Potatoe on the End of it in one Hand, and a\r\n  three-square Bottle, inscribed _Green Usquebaugh_ in the other.]\r\n\r\n  53. _An original Portrait of the present Emperor of Russia._\r\n\r\n  54. _Ditto of the Empress Queen of Hungary, its Antagonist._ [These\r\n  are two old signs of the Saracen’s Head and Queen Anne. Under the\r\n  first is written THE ZARR, and under the other the EMPRES QUEAN. They\r\n  are lolling their tongues out at each other, and over their heads runs\r\n  a wooden label, inscribed, _The present State of Europe_.]\r\n\r\n  56. _The Ghost of Cock Lane. By Miss Fanny ----._ [The figure of two\r\n  hands, one bearing a hammer, the other a curry-comb, in allusion to\r\n  knocking and scratching.]\r\n\r\n  58. _All the World and his Wife. By Blackman._ [The figure of a\r\n  foolish-looking fellow, with the globe round his body, (like Orbis in\r\n  the Rehearsal,) and his wife cudgelling him.]\r\n\r\n  60. _A Prospective View of Billingsgate, or Lectures on Elocution._\r\n\r\n  61. _The Robin Hood Society, a Conversation; or Lectures on Elocution.\r\n  Its Companion. These two by Barnsley._ [These two Strokes at a famous\r\n  Lecturer on Elocution,[736] and The Reverend Projector of a Rhetorical\r\n  Academy, are admirably conceived and executed: and (the latter more\r\n  especially) almost worthy the Hand of Hogarth. They are full of a\r\n  Variety of droll Figures, and seem indeed to be the Work of a great\r\n  Master, struggling to suppress his Superiority of Genius, and\r\n  endeavouring to paint down to the common Stile and Manner of the\r\n  School of Sign-painting.]\r\n\r\n  64. _View of the Road to Paddington, with a Presentation of the\r\n  Deadly-Never-Green, that bears Fruit all the year round. The Fruit at\r\n  full Length. By Hagarty._ [Tyburn with three Felons on the Gallows.\r\n  This _Piece_ is remarkable for the _Execution_.]\r\n\r\n  65. _The Salutation, or French and English Manners. By Blackman._ [An\r\n  English Jack Tar, kicking, and taking a tawdry Mounseer, cringing and\r\n  bowing, by the Nose.]\r\n\r\n  66. _Good Company. A Conversation. Intended as a Sign for a\r\n  Tobacconist. By Bransley._ [The Conceit and Execution are admirable.\r\n  It represents a Common-Council-Man, and two Friends, drunk, over a\r\n  Bottle and a Pipe. The Common-Council-Man is fallen back on his Chair\r\n  as asleep. One of the Friends, an officer, is lighting a Pipe at his\r\n  red Nose, while the other, a Doctor, is using his Thumb for a Tobacco\r\n  Stopper.]\r\n\r\n  68. _Hogs-Norton. A Sign for a Musick-Shop. By Bransley._ [Represents\r\n  (in allusion to the old saying concerning Hog’s Norton) an Hog drest\r\n  in a Laced Suit, and an enormous Tye Wig, playing upon the Organ.]\r\n\r\n  69. _St Dunstan and the Devil._ [The Saint Taking the Devil by the\r\n  Nose.]\r\n\r\n  70. _St Squintum and the Devil, its Companion. By ----._ [Dr W----d\r\n  doing the same. The Portrait is not unlike the Doctor.[737]]\r\n\r\n  71. _Shave for a Penny, Let Blood for Nothing._ [A Man under the Hands\r\n  of a Barber-Surgeon, who shaves and lets Blood at the same Time, by\r\n  cutting at every Stroke of his Razor.]\r\n\r\n  72. _Teeth Drawn with a Touch. A Caricature. Its Companion._ [A Man in\r\n  much the same circumstances, mutatis mutandis, under the Hands of a\r\n  Tooth-Drawer.]\r\n\r\n“Such,” says the _London Register_, “are the Original Paintings in the\r\nSociety’s Collection.” It may be remarked that there is some humour in\r\nplacing many of the signs, which of themselves would not be very\r\nstriking: for instance, THE THREE APOTHECARIES’ GALLIPOTS, with THE\r\nTHREE COFFINS as its companion; KING CHARLES IN THE OAK, and by its side\r\nTHE OWL IN THE IVY BUSH. Some of the signs are very indelicate, but this\r\nobjection does not appear amongst the many charges brought against Mr\r\nThornton and his friends. The opinion of society upon this point was\r\nvery different in the last century from what it is now.\r\n\r\nBesides the official catalogue there also appears to have been a comic\r\nor satirical guide, for the newspapers of the day advertise--\r\n\r\n  _This Day was published, Price 6d._,\r\n\r\n  HA! HA! HA! Or the Laugher’s Companion to the GRAND EXHIBITION of the\r\n  SIGN PAINTERS. Also He! He! He! Or the Artist’s Guide to the Society’s\r\n  Exhibition.\r\n\r\n  Printed for W. Nicholl, at the Papermill, in St Paul’s Churchyard.\r\n\r\nWe shall close this subject with a paper in favour of the much abused\r\nexhibition, a weak, but well meant, effusion in doggerel rhyme:--\r\n\r\n  _To the_ PRINTER _of_ THE ST JAMES’S CHRONICLE.\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n  As the Sign Painters in this Catalogue have directed any Essays on\r\n  their Exhibition to be sent to you, I have troubled you with the\r\n  enclosed Trifle, by inserting which in your Chronicle, you will oblige\r\n\r\n  Your humble Servant\r\n\r\n  And constant Reader\r\n\r\n  A FRIEND TO THE SIGN PAINTERS.\r\n\r\n  _Addressed to the Gentlemen of the Society of_ SIGN PAINTERS.\r\n\r\n  Though Malice darts around malignant Rays\r\n  And pow’rful Envy all its Spleen displays:\r\n  Go on, great Chiefs, pursue your noble Play,\r\n  And nobly end, what nobly you began.\r\n  Spite of Detraction shall your Mirth rise\r\n  With odorif’rous Flavour to the Skies,\r\n  And _Masmore’s_, _Lester’s_, _Ward’s_, and _Fishbourne’s_ Name,\r\n  With thine, Van Dyke, shall live to endless Fame;\r\n  For your Collection Wit and Skill combine,\r\n  And Humour flows in ev’ry well chose Sign;\r\n  To you the Palm, th’ admiring World must give,\r\n  To you the Honour ev’ry Artist leave.\r\n  Regard not they the little-minded’s Rage,\r\n  Nor dread the snarling Critic’s angry Page;\r\n  For conscious Worth shall be your safest Guard,\r\n  And Immortality your sure Reward.\r\n\r\n  April 27-29, 1762.       E. N.\r\n\r\n[723] In Farringdon Street; the head-quarters of the London\r\nSign-Painters.\r\n\r\n[724] In allusion to a well-known art-theory of Hogarth’s.\r\n\r\n[725] Fanny Parsons was the girl who played such an active part in the\r\nCock Lane ghost performances, Jan. and Feb. 1762.\r\n\r\n[726] A famous discussion club held at the Robin Hood Tavern, Essex\r\nStreet, Strand.\r\n\r\n[727] Evidently an allusion to Edmund Curll, the notorious bookseller,\r\nwho stood in the Pillory at Cheapside.\r\n\r\n[728] The gallows at Tyburn.\r\n\r\n[729] A corruption of _Hook-Norton_, the name of a small village in\r\nOxfordshire, where the hogs formerly played upon the church organ. So,\r\nat least, the story runs.\r\n\r\n[730] “St Squintum” was probably intended for John Whitfield, the famous\r\npreacher, whose personal appearance was the subject of numerous lampoons\r\nand caricatures at this time.\r\n\r\n[731] This seemed to be a sort of slang phrase equivalent to the\r\npresent--“It’s all my eye;” it occurs in “Tom Brown,” vol. ii., p. 13,\r\n1708. See also p. 467 of this work.\r\n\r\n[732] 35. From another source we learn that this was very\r\ndifferent:--“No. 35. A Man in his Element, a sign for an\r\nEating-house,”--a cook roasted on a spit at a kitchen fire, and basted\r\nby the devil.\r\n\r\n[733] In allusion to Peeping Tom, the shoemaker of Coventry.\r\n\r\n[734] Under the title of--“PARTICULAR ACCOUNT of the GRAND EXHIBITION in\r\nBow Street, with Remarks and Illustrations of it.”\r\n\r\n[735] Bonnell Thornton composed an ode on St Cecilia’s Day, which was\r\nset to music by Dr Burney, and performed by the aid of those national\r\ninstruments, the marrow bones and cleavers. The affair came off at\r\nRanelagh, and gave general satisfaction. In a former chapter we have\r\ngiven full particulars of this event. Thornton was born in London 1724,\r\neducated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. In connection\r\nwith Geo. Colman the elder he started the _Connoisseur_, the _St James’\r\nChronicle_, and other periodicals. He died May 9, 1768, and was buried\r\nin Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n[736] Orator Henley is doubtless intended.\r\n\r\n[737] The celebrated preacher, George Whitfield, who was chaplain to\r\nSelina, Countess of Huntingdon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.

retained, except as\r\nmentioned below. Names and publications that were spelled differently in\r\nvarious places have not been standardised. The sorting of the index has\r\nnot been changed.\r\n\r\nDepending on the hard- and software used and their settings, not all\r\ncharacters and symbols may display as intended.\r\n\r\nPhrases such as “this century,” “last century,” “the present day,”\r\n“modern,” etc. should be read with 1866 (the year of publication of the\r\nfirst impression) as the reference point.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemarks on the text\r\n\r\nNot all quotations presented in this book are verbatim quotations.\r\n\r\nWouwverman and Wouverman probably refer to Wouwerman.\r\n\r\nFootnote [35]: The Three Balls of the Pawnbrokers are explained under\r\nHeraldic and Emblematic Signs, not under Miscellaneous Signs.\r\n\r\nPage 103: Rivingtons the publishers: possibly an error for Rivington the\r\npublisher.\r\n\r\nPage 134, Sussen: possibly an error for Sussex.\r\n\r\nPage 336, reference to the Good Lawyer: presumably this is a reference\r\nto the HONEST LAWYER.\r\n\r\nPage 514, Hogarty: possibly error for Hagarty (as announced on page\r\n512).\r\n\r\nFootnote [677]: page 297 is in the chapter Saints, Martyrs, etc., not in\r\nthe chapter Legendary and Biblical Signs. The page reference is correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges made to the text\r\n\r\nFootnotes have been moved to the end of the chapter.\r\n\r\nObvious punctuation errors have been corrected silently; missing quote\r\nmarks have been added only when it was clear where they should be added\r\n(therefore not all quote marks close properly).\r\n\r\n_i. e._ has been standardised to _i.e._.\r\n\r\nWhere necessary, a space has been inserted before abbreviated Dutch\r\nwords (’t, ’n, ’s etc.). Other corrections in quotations have been\r\nverified with outside sources (if possible the ones referred to in this\r\nwork) or with the translation given; such corrections were only made\r\nwhen the printed text contained obvious errors.\r\n\r\nSecond Plate I. has been renumbered to Plate II.\r\n\r\nPage 70: che changed to the\r\n\r\nPage 77: footnote anchor [96] inserted after funera concors\r\n\r\nPage 83: twelve player changed to twelve players\r\n\r\nPage 109: Admyralyte changed to Admyraltye\r\n\r\nPage 117: y_{e} sign changed to y^{e} sign\r\n\r\nPage 122: as in merken kan changed to as ik merken kan\r\n\r\nPage 125: dwellig changed to dwelling\r\n\r\nPage 132: Compleat Ambssador changed to Compleat Ambassador\r\n\r\nPage 175: me tyzer changed to met yzer\r\n\r\nFootnote 265: bo ke changed to booke\r\n\r\nFootnote 276: dithy rambics changed to dithyrambics\r\n\r\nPage 201: anyrate changed to any rate\r\n\r\nPage 209: latterry changed to latterly\r\n\r\nPage 231: Comèdie changed to Comédie\r\n\r\nPage 251: Alseen changed to Als een\r\n\r\nPage 259: footnote anchor [373] added after extravagances\r\n\r\nPage 263: Alyso changed to Also\r\n\r\nPage 270: y Angel and Crown changed to y^{e} Angel and Crown\r\n\r\nPage 282: min de minsch int beeste villen changed to men de mensch uit\r\nbeestevellen; gilt changed to gelt; bestillen changed to bestellen; zeep\r\nchanged to zelf\r\n\r\nPage 299: Flechnoe changed to Flecknoe\r\n\r\nPage 305: ... the particular trade ... changed to ... of the particular\r\ntrade ...\r\n\r\nPage 346: dipsetic changed to dyspeptic\r\n\r\nPage 353: Troost for Zuigelingen changed to Troost voor Zuigelingen\r\n\r\nPage 354: that edel kruyt changed to dat edel kruyt; Teckere changed to\r\nLeckere; beginnez changed to beginnen; Zoekje changed to Zoek je\r\n\r\nPage 372: Tallemant des Reaux changed to Tallement des Réaux as\r\nelsewhere; Rucholt changed to Ruckholt\r\n\r\nPage 381: eighteeenth changed to eighteenth\r\n\r\nPage 390: maarkomt in changed to maar komt in\r\n\r\nPage 403: Our ’t hoofd changed to Om ’t hoofd; Voer der staten kroon\r\nchanged to Voor der staten kroon\r\n\r\nPage 404: three-house wifely changed to three house-wifely\r\n\r\nPage 442: gelaars de haan en gelaar de haan changed to gelaarsde haan;\r\ndrees changed to dees\r\n\r\nPage 443: In den gelaars den changed to In den gelaarsden\r\n\r\nPage 446: Van daag voor geld, morg in voor niet changed to Vandaag voor\r\ngeld, morgen voor niet\r\n\r\nPage 450: Dus na ben in changed to Dus na ben ik\r\n\r\nPage 453: garing changed to garish\r\n\r\nFootnote [667]: Geldorland changed to Gelderland\r\n\r\nPage 477: Hetzner changed to Hentzner\r\n\r\nPage 488: ckeker of the Hope changed to cheker of the Hope\r\n\r\nPage 529: 588 changed to 388\r\n\r\nPage 535: page number 147 added after Three Leopard’s Heads.",
