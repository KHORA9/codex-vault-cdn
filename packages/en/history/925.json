BUSH\r\n\r\n1789-2005\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nIN THE CITY OF NEW YORK THURSDAY, APRIL 30, 1789\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The Nation's first chief executive took his oath\r\nof office in April in New York City on the balcony of the Senate Chamber\r\nat Federal Hall on Wall Street. General Washington had been unanimously\r\nelected President by the first electoral college, and John Adams was\r\nelected Vice President because he received the second greatest number of\r\nvotes. Under the rules, each elector cast two votes. The Chancellor of\r\nNew York and fellow Freemason, Robert R. Livingston administered the\r\noath of office. The Bible on which the oath was sworn belonged to New\r\nYork's St. John's Masonic Lodge. The new President gave his inaugural\r\naddress before a joint session of the two Houses of Congress assembled\r\ninside the Senate Chamber.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:\r\n\r\nAmong the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me\r\nwith greater anxieties than that of which the notification was\r\ntransmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the present\r\nmonth. On the one hand, I was summoned by my Country, whose voice I can\r\nnever hear but with veneration and love, from a retreat which I had\r\nchosen with the fondest predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with\r\nan immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining years--a retreat\r\nwhich was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me\r\nby the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions\r\nin my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other\r\nhand, the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my\r\ncountry called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most\r\nexperienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his\r\nqualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who\r\n(inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the\r\nduties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his\r\nown deficiencies. In this conflict of emotions all I dare aver is that\r\nit has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just\r\nappreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected. All I\r\ndare hope is that if, in executing this task, I have been too much\r\nswayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances, or by an\r\naffectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of\r\nmy fellow-citizens, and have thence too little consulted my incapacity\r\nas well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me,\r\nmy error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me, and its\r\nconsequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality\r\nin which they originated.\r\n\r\nSuch being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the\r\npublic summons, repaired to the present station, it would be peculiarly\r\nimproper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to\r\nthat Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the\r\ncouncils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every human\r\ndefect, that His benediction may consecrate to the liberties and\r\nhappiness of the people of the United States a Government instituted by\r\nthemselves for these essential purposes, and may enable every instrument\r\nemployed in its administration to execute with success the functions\r\nallotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of\r\nevery public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your\r\nsentiments not less than my own, nor those of my fellow-citizens at\r\nlarge less than either. No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore\r\nthe Invisible Hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of\r\nthe United States. Every step by which they have advanced to the\r\ncharacter of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by\r\nsome token of providential agency; and in the important revolution just\r\naccomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil\r\ndeliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from\r\nwhich the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which\r\nmost governments have been established without some return of pious\r\ngratitude, along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings\r\nwhich the past seem to presage. These reflections, arising out of the\r\npresent crisis, have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be\r\nsuppressed. You will join with me, I trust, in thinking that there are\r\nnone under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free\r\ngovernment can more auspiciously commence.\r\n\r\nBy the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty\r\nof the President \"to recommend to your consideration such measures as he\r\nshall judge necessary and expedient.\" The circumstances under which I\r\nnow meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further than\r\nto refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are\r\nassembled, and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to\r\nwhich your attention is to be given. It will be more consistent with\r\nthose circumstances, and far more congenial with the feelings which\r\nactuate me, to substitute, in place of a recommendation of particular\r\nmeasures, the tribute that is due to the talents, the rectitude, and the\r\npatriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them.\r\nIn these honorable qualifications I behold the surest pledges that as on\r\none side no local prejudices or attachments, no separate views nor party\r\nanimosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought\r\nto watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests, so, on\r\nanother, that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the\r\npure and immutable principles of private morality, and the preeminence\r\nof free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win\r\nthe affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world. I\r\ndwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for\r\nmy country can inspire, since there is no truth more thoroughly\r\nestablished than that there exists in the economy and course of nature\r\nan indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and\r\nadvantage; between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous\r\npolicy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity; since we\r\nought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of Heaven can\r\nnever be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order\r\nand right which Heaven itself has ordained; and since the preservation\r\nof the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of\r\ngovernment are justly considered, perhaps, as deeply, as finally, staked\r\non the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with\r\nyour judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power\r\ndelegated by the fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient\r\nat the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been\r\nurged against the system, or by the degree of inquietude which has given\r\nbirth to them. Instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this\r\nsubject, in which I could be guided by no lights derived from official\r\nopportunities, I shall again give way to my entire confidence in your\r\ndiscernment and pursuit of the public good; for I assure myself that\r\nwhilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the\r\nbenefits of an united and effective government, or which ought to await\r\nthe future lessons of experience, a reverence for the characteristic\r\nrights of freemen and a regard  for the public harmony will sufficiently\r\ninfluence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be\r\nimpregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing observations I have one to add, which will be most\r\nproperly addressed to the House of Representatives. It concerns myself,\r\nand will therefore be as brief as possible. When I was first honored\r\nwith a call into the service of my country, then on the eve of an\r\narduous struggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my\r\nduty required that I should renounce every pecuniary compensation. From\r\nthis resolution I have in no instance departed; and being still under\r\nthe impressions which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable to\r\nmyself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably\r\nincluded in a permanent provision for the executive department, and must\r\naccordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which I\r\nam placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual\r\nexpenditures as the public good may be thought to require.\r\n\r\nHaving thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by\r\nthe occasion which brings us together, I shall take my present leave;\r\nbut not without resorting once more to the benign Parent of the Human\r\nRace in humble supplication that, since He has been pleased to favor the\r\nAmerican people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect\r\ntranquillity, and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity\r\non a form of government for the security of their union and the\r\nadvancement of their happiness, so His divine blessing may be equally\r\nconspicuous in the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and the\r\nwise measures on which the success of this Government must depend.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE WASHINGTON, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nIN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, MONDAY, MARCH 4, 1793\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: President Washington's second oath of office was\r\ntaken in the Senate Chamber of Congress Hall in Philadelphia on March 4,\r\nthe date fixed by the Continental Congress for inaugurations. Before an\r\nassembly of Congressmen, Cabinet officers, judges of the federal and\r\ndistrict courts, foreign officials, and a small gathering of\r\nPhiladelphians, the President offered the shortest inaugural address\r\never given. Associate Justice of the Supreme Court William Cushing\r\nadministered the oath of office.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow Citizens:\r\n\r\nI am again called upon by the voice of my country to execute the\r\nfunctions of its Chief Magistrate. When the occasion proper for it shall\r\narrive, I shall endeavor to express the high sense I entertain of this\r\ndistinguished honor, and of the confidence which has been reposed in me\r\nby the people of united America.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the execution of any official act of the President the\r\nConstitution requires an oath of office. This oath I am now about to\r\ntake, and in your presence: That if it shall be found during my\r\nadministration of the Government I have in any instance violated\r\nwillingly or knowingly the injunctions thereof, I may (besides incurring\r\nconstitutional punishment) be subject to the upbraidings of all who are\r\nnow witnesses of the present solemn ceremony.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nIN THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA SATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1797\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: The first Vice President became the second\r\nPresident of the United States. His opponent in the election, Thomas\r\nJefferson, had won the second greatest number of electoral votes and\r\ntherefore had been elected Vice President by the electoral college.\r\nChief Justice Oliver Ellsworth administered the oath of office in the\r\nHall of the House of Representatives in Federal Hall before a joint\r\nsession of Congress.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it was first perceived, in early times, that no middle course for\r\nAmerica remained between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature\r\nand a total independence of its claims, men of reflection were less\r\napprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleets and armies\r\nthey must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions\r\nwhich would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be\r\ninstituted over the whole and over the parts of this extensive country.\r\nRelying, however, on the purity of their intentions, the justice of\r\ntheir cause, and the integrity and intelligence of the people, under an\r\noverruling Providence which had so signally protected this country from\r\nthe first, the representatives of this nation, then consisting of little\r\nmore than half its present number, not only broke to pieces the chains\r\nwhich were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up, but frankly\r\ncut asunder the ties which had bound them, and launched into an ocean of\r\nuncertainty.\r\n\r\nThe zeal and ardor of the people during the Revolutionary war, supplying\r\nthe place of government, commanded a degree of order sufficient at least\r\nfor the temporary preservation of society. The Confederation which was\r\nearly felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the Batavian\r\nand Helvetic confederacies, the only examples which remain with any\r\ndetail and precision in history, and certainly the only ones which the\r\npeople at large had ever considered. But reflecting on the striking\r\ndifference in so many particulars between this country and those where a\r\ncourier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single\r\nday, it was then certainly foreseen by some who assisted in Congress at\r\nthe formation of it that it could not be durable.\r\n\r\nNegligence of its regulations, inattention to its recommendations, if\r\nnot disobedience to its authority, not only in individuals but in\r\nStates, soon appeared with their melancholy consequences--universal\r\nlanguor, jealousies and rivalries of States, decline of navigation and\r\ncommerce, discouragement of necessary manufactures, universal fall in\r\nthe value of lands and their produce, contempt of public and private\r\nfaith, loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations, and at\r\nlength in discontents, animosities, combinations, partial conventions,\r\nand insurrection, threatening some great national calamity.\r\n\r\nIn this dangerous crisis the people of America were not abandoned by\r\ntheir usual good sense, presence of mind, resolution, or integrity.\r\nMeasures were pursued to concert a plan to form a more perfect union,\r\nestablish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common\r\ndefense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of\r\nliberty. The public disquisitions, discussions, and deliberations issued\r\nin the present happy Constitution of Government.\r\n\r\nEmployed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of\r\nthese transactions, I first saw the Constitution of the United States in\r\na foreign country. Irritated by no literary altercation, animated by no\r\npublic debate, heated by no party animosity, I read it with great\r\nsatisfaction, as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts, as an\r\nexperiment better adapted to the genius, character, situation, and\r\nrelations of this nation and country than any which had ever been\r\nproposed or suggested. In its general principles and great outlines it\r\nwas conformable to such a system of government as I had ever most\r\nesteemed, and in some States, my own native State in particular, had\r\ncontributed to establish. Claiming a right of suffrage, in common with\r\nmy fellow-citizens, in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which\r\nwas to rule me and my posterity, as well as them and theirs, I did not\r\nhesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasions, in public and\r\nin private. It was not then, nor has been since, any objection to it in\r\nmy mind that the Executive and Senate were not more permanent. Nor have\r\nI ever entertained a thought of promoting any alteration in it but such\r\nas the people themselves, in the course of their experience, should see\r\nand feel to be necessary or expedient, and by their representatives in\r\nCongress and the State legislatures, according to the Constitution\r\nitself, adopt and ordain.\r\n\r\nReturning to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it\r\nfor ten years, I had the honor to be elected to a station under the new\r\norder of things, and I have repeatedly laid myself under the most\r\nserious obligations to support the Constitution. The operation of it has\r\nequaled the most sanguine expectations of its friends, and from an\r\nhabitual attention to it, satisfaction in its administration, and\r\ndelight in its effects upon the peace, order, prosperity, and happiness\r\nof the nation I have acquired an habitual attachment to it and\r\nveneration for it.\r\n\r\nWhat other form of government, indeed, can so well deserve our esteem\r\nand love?\r\n\r\nThere may be little solidity in an ancient idea that congregations of\r\nmen into cities and nations are the most pleasing objects in the sight\r\nof superior intelligences, but this is very certain, that to a\r\nbenevolent human mind there can be no spectacle presented by any nation\r\nmore pleasing, more noble, majestic, or august, than an assembly like\r\nthat which has so often been seen in this and the other Chamber of\r\nCongress, of a Government in which the Executive authority, as well as\r\nthat of all the branches of the Legislature, are exercised by citizens\r\nselected at regular periods by their neighbors to make and execute laws\r\nfor the general good. Can anything essential, anything more than mere\r\nornament and decoration, be added to this by robes and diamonds? Can\r\nauthority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from\r\naccidents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it\r\nsprings fresh from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened\r\npeople? For it is the people only that are represented. It is their\r\npower and majesty that is reflected, and only for their good, in every\r\nlegitimate government, under whatever form it may appear. The existence\r\nof such a government as ours for any length of time is a full proof of a\r\ngeneral dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body\r\nof the people. And what object or consideration more pleasing than this\r\ncan be presented to the human mind? If national pride is ever\r\njustifiable or excusable it is when it springs, not from power or\r\nriches, grandeur or glory, but from conviction of national innocence,\r\ninformation, and benevolence.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to\r\nourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if\r\nanything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free,\r\nfair, virtuous, and independent elections. If an election is to be\r\ndetermined by a majority of a single vote, and that can be procured by a\r\nparty through artifice or corruption, the Government may be the choice\r\nof a party for its own ends, not of the nation for the national good. If\r\nthat solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or\r\nmenaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the\r\nGovernment may not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign\r\nnations. It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the\r\npeople, who govern ourselves; and candid men will acknowledge that in\r\nsuch cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nSuch is the amiable and interesting system of government (and such are\r\nsome of the abuses to which it may be exposed) which the people of\r\nAmerica have exhibited to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and\r\nvirtuous of all nations for eight years under the administration of a\r\ncitizen who, by a long course of great actions, regulated by prudence,\r\njustice, temperance, and fortitude, conducting a people inspired with\r\nthe same virtues and animated with the same ardent patriotism and love\r\nof liberty to independence and peace, to increasing wealth and\r\nunexampled prosperity, has merited the gratitude of his fellow-citizens,\r\ncommanded the highest praises of foreign nations, and secured immortal\r\nglory with posterity.\r\n\r\nIn that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to\r\nenjoy the delicious recollection of his services, the gratitude of\r\nmankind, the happy fruits of them to himself and the world, which are\r\ndaily increasing, and that splendid prospect of the future fortunes of\r\nthis country which is opening from year to year. His name may be still a\r\nrampart, and the knowledge that he lives a bulwark, against all open or\r\nsecret enemies of his country's peace. This example has been recommended\r\nto the imitation of his successors by both Houses of Congress and by the\r\nvoice of the legislatures and the people throughout the nation.\r\n\r\nOn this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with\r\ndiffidence; but as something may be expected, the occasion, I hope, will\r\nbe admitted as an apology if I venture to say that if a preference, upon\r\nprinciple, of a free republican government, formed upon long and serious\r\nreflection, after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth; if an\r\nattachment to the Constitution of the United States, and a conscientious\r\ndetermination to support it until it shall be altered by the judgments\r\nand wishes of the people, expressed in the mode prescribed in it; if a\r\nrespectful attention to the constitutions of the individual States and a\r\nconstant caution and delicacy toward the State governments; if an equal\r\nand impartial regard to the rights, interest, honor, and happiness of\r\nall the States in the Union, without preference or regard to a northern\r\nor southern, an eastern or western, position, their various political\r\nopinions on unessential points or their personal attachments; if a love\r\nof virtuous men of all parties and denominations; if a love of science\r\nand letters and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage\r\nschools, colleges, universities, academies, and every institution for\r\npropagating knowledge, virtue, and religion among all classes of the\r\npeople, not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in\r\nall its stages and classes, and of society in all its forms, but as the\r\nonly means of preserving our Constitution from its natural enemies, the\r\nspirit of sophistry, the spirit of party, the spirit of intrigue, the\r\nprofligacy of corruption, and the pestilence of foreign influence, which\r\nis the angel of destruction to elective governments; if a love of equal\r\nlaws, of justice, and humanity in the interior administration; if an\r\ninclination to improve agriculture, commerce, and manufacturers for\r\nnecessity, convenience, and defense; if a spirit of equity and humanity\r\ntoward the aboriginal nations of America, and a disposition to meliorate\r\ntheir condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us, and our\r\ncitizens to be more friendly to them; if an inflexible determination to\r\nmaintain peace and inviolable faith with all nations, and that system of\r\nneutrality and impartiality among the belligerent powers of Europe which\r\nhas been adopted by this Government and so solemnly sanctioned by both\r\nHouses of Congress and applauded by the legislatures of the States and\r\nthe public opinion, until it shall be otherwise ordained by Congress; if\r\na personal esteem for the French nation, formed in a residence of seven\r\nyears chiefly among them, and a sincere desire to preserve the\r\nfriendship which has been so much for the honor and interest of both\r\nnations; if, while the conscious honor and integrity of the people of\r\nAmerica and the internal sentiment of their own power and energies must\r\nbe preserved, an earnest endeavor to investigate every just cause and\r\nremove every colorable pretense of complaint; if an intention to pursue\r\nby amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been\r\ncommitted on the commerce of our fellow-citizens by whatever nation, and\r\nif success can not be obtained, to lay the facts before the Legislature,\r\nthat they may consider what further measures the honor and interest of\r\nthe Government and its constituents demand; if a resolution to do\r\njustice as far as may depend upon me, at all times and to all nations,\r\nand maintain peace, friendship, and benevolence with all the world; if\r\nan unshaken confidence in the honor, spirit, and resources of the\r\nAmerican people, on which I have so often hazarded my all and never been\r\ndeceived; if elevated ideas of the high destinies of this country and of\r\nmy own duties toward it, founded on a knowledge of the moral principles\r\nand intellectual improvements of the people deeply engraven on my mind\r\nin early life, and not obscured but exalted by experience and age; and,\r\nwith humble reverence, I feel it to be my duty to add, if a veneration\r\nfor the religion of a people who profess and call themselves Christians,\r\nand a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for Christianity\r\namong the best recommendations for the public service, can enable me in\r\nany degree to comply with your wishes, it shall be my strenuous endeavor\r\nthat this sagacious injunction of the two Houses shall not be without\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nWith this great example before me, with the sense and spirit, the faith\r\nand honor, the duty and interest, of the same American people pledged to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States, I entertain no doubt of\r\nits continuance in all its energy, and my mind is prepared without\r\nhesitation to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support it\r\nto the utmost of my power.\r\n\r\nAnd may that Being who is supreme over all, the Patron of Order, the\r\nFountain of Justice, and the Protector in all ages of the world of\r\nvirtuous liberty, continue His blessing upon this nation and its\r\nGovernment and give it all possible success and duration consistent with\r\nthe ends of His providence.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nIN THE WASHINGTON, D.C., WEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1801\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  Chief Justice John Marshall administered the first\r\nexecutive oath of office ever taken in the new federal city in the new\r\nSenate Chamber (now the Old Supreme Court Chamber) of the partially\r\nbuilt Capitol building. The outcome of the election of 1800 had been in\r\ndoubt until late February because Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, the\r\ntwo leading candidates, each had received 73 electoral votes.\r\nConsequently, the House of Representatives met in a special session to\r\nresolve the impasse, pursuant to the terms spelled out in the\r\nConstitution. After 30 hours of debate and balloting, Mr. Jefferson\r\nemerged as the President and Mr. Burr the Vice President. President John\r\nAdams, who had run unsuccessfully for a second term, left Washington on\r\nthe day of the inauguration without attending the ceremony.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFriends and Fellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nCalled upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our\r\ncountry, I avail myself of the presence of that portion of my\r\nfellow-citizens which is here assembled to express my grateful thanks\r\nfor the favor with which they have been pleased to look toward me, to\r\ndeclare a sincere consciousness that the task is above my talents, and\r\nthat I approach it with those anxious and awful presentiments which the\r\ngreatness of the charge and the weakness of my powers so justly inspire.\r\nA rising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful land, traversing all\r\nthe seas with the rich productions of their industry, engaged in\r\ncommerce with nations who feel power and forget right, advancing rapidly\r\nto destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye--when I contemplate these\r\ntranscendent objects, and see the honor, the happiness, and the hopes of\r\nthis beloved country committed to the issue, and the auspices of this\r\nday, I shrink from the contemplation, and humble myself before the\r\nmagnitude of the undertaking. Utterly, indeed, should I despair did not\r\nthe presence of many whom I here see remind me that in the other high\r\nauthorities provided by our Constitution I shall find resources of\r\nwisdom, of virtue, and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties.\r\nTo you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with the sovereign functions of\r\nlegislation, and to those associated with you, I look with encouragement\r\nfor that guidance and support which may enable us to steer with safety\r\nthe vessel in which we are all embarked amidst the conflicting elements\r\nof a troubled world.\r\n\r\nDuring the contest of opinion through which we have passed the animation\r\nof discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might\r\nimpose on strangers unused to think freely and to speak and to write\r\nwhat they think; but this being now decided by the voice of the nation,\r\nannounced according to the rules of the Constitution, all will, of\r\ncourse, arrange themselves under the will of the law, and unite in\r\ncommon efforts for the common good. All, too, will bear in mind this\r\nsacred principle, that though the will of the majority is in all cases\r\nto prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that the\r\nminority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and\r\nto violate would be oppression. Let us, then, fellow-citizens, unite\r\nwith one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that\r\nharmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but\r\ndreary things. And let us reflect that, having banished from our land\r\nthat religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and\r\nsuffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance a political\r\nintolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody\r\npersecutions. During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world,\r\nduring the agonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking through blood and\r\nslaughter his long-lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the\r\nagitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful\r\nshore; that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by\r\nothers, and should divide opinions as to measures of safety. But every\r\ndifference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called\r\nby different names brethren of the same principle. We are all\r\nRepublicans, we are all Federalists. If there be any among us who would\r\nwish to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form, let them\r\nstand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion\r\nmay be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it. I know, indeed,\r\nthat some honest men fear that a republican government can not be\r\nstrong, that this Government is not strong enough; but would the honest\r\npatriot, in the full tide of successful experiment, abandon a government\r\nwhich has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary\r\nfear that this Government, the world's best hope, may by possibility\r\nwant energy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this, on the\r\ncontrary, the strongest Government on earth. I believe it the only one\r\nwhere every man, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of\r\nthe law, and would meet invasions of the public order as his own\r\npersonal concern. Sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with\r\nthe government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted with the government\r\nof others? Or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him?\r\nLet history answer this question.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, with courage and confidence pursue our own Federal and\r\nRepublican principles, our attachment to union and representative\r\ngovernment. Kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the\r\nexterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe; too high-minded to\r\nendure the degradations of the others; possessing a chosen country, with\r\nroom enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth\r\ngeneration; entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of\r\nour own faculties, to the acquisitions of our own industry, to honor and\r\nconfidence from our fellow-citizens, resulting not from birth, but from\r\nour actions and their sense of them; enlightened by a benign religion,\r\nprofessed, indeed, and practiced in various forms, yet all of them\r\ninculcating honesty, truth, temperance, gratitude, and the love of man;\r\nacknowledging and adoring an overruling Providence, which by all its\r\ndispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here and\r\nhis greater happiness hereafter--with all these blessings, what more is\r\nnecessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people? Still one thing\r\nmore, fellow-citizens--a wise and frugal Government, which shall\r\nrestrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free\r\nto regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall\r\nnot take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the\r\nsum of good government, and this is necessary to close the circle of our\r\nfelicities.\r\n\r\nAbout to enter, fellow-citizens, on the exercise of duties which\r\ncomprehend everything dear and valuable to you, it is proper you should\r\nunderstand what I deem the essential principles of our Government, and\r\nconsequently those which ought to shape its Administration. I will\r\ncompress them within the narrowest compass they will bear, stating the\r\ngeneral principle, but not all its limitations. Equal and exact justice\r\nto all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious or political;\r\npeace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling\r\nalliances with none; the support of the State governments in all their\r\nrights, as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns\r\nand the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies; the\r\npreservation of the General Government in its whole constitutional\r\nvigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad; a\r\njealous care of the right of election by the people--a mild and safe\r\ncorrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where\r\npeaceable remedies are unprovided; absolute acquiescence in the\r\ndecisions of the majority, the vital principle of republics, from which\r\nis no appeal but to force, the vital principle and immediate parent of\r\ndespotism; a well disciplined militia, our best reliance in peace and\r\nfor the first moments of war, till regulars may relieve them; the\r\nsupremacy of the civil over the military authority; economy in the\r\npublic expense, that labor may be lightly burthened; the honest payment\r\nof our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith; encouragement\r\nof agriculture, and of commerce as its handmaid; the diffusion of\r\ninformation and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public\r\nreason; freedom of religion; freedom of the press, and freedom of person\r\nunder the protection of the habeas corpus, and trial by juries\r\nimpartially selected. These principles form the bright constellation\r\nwhich has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of\r\nrevolution and reformation. The wisdom of our sages and blood of our\r\nheroes have been devoted to their attainment. They should be the creed\r\nof our political faith, the text of civic instruction, the touchstone by\r\nwhich to try the services of those we trust; and should we wander from\r\nthem in moments of error or of alarm, let us hasten to retrace our steps\r\nand to regain the road which alone leads to peace, liberty, and safety.\r\n\r\nI repair, then, fellow-citizens, to the post you have assigned me. With\r\nexperience enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties\r\nof this the greatest of all, I have learnt to expect that it will rarely\r\nfall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from this station with the\r\nreputation and the favor which bring him into it. Without pretensions to\r\nthat high confidence you reposed in our first and greatest revolutionary\r\ncharacter, whose preeminent services had entitled him to the first place\r\nin his country's love and destined for him the fairest page in the\r\nvolume of faithful history, I ask so much confidence only as may give\r\nfirmness and effect to the legal administration of your affairs. I shall\r\noften go wrong through defect of judgment. When right, I shall often be\r\nthought wrong by those whose positions will not command a view of the\r\nwhole ground. I ask your indulgence for my own errors, which will never\r\nbe intentional, and your support against the errors of others, who may\r\ncondemn what they would not if seen in all its parts. The approbation\r\nimplied by your suffrage is a great consolation to me for the past, and\r\nmy future solicitude will be to retain the good opinion of those who\r\nhave bestowed it in advance, to conciliate that of others by doing them\r\nall the good in my power, and to be instrumental to the happiness and\r\nfreedom of all.\r\n\r\nRelying, then, on the patronage of your good will, I advance with\r\nobedience to the work, ready to retire from it whenever you become\r\nsensible how much better choice it is in your power to make. And may\r\nthat Infinite Power which rules the destinies of the universe lead our\r\ncouncils to what is best, and give them a favorable issue for your peace\r\nand prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nIN WASHINGTON D.C., MONDAY, MARCH 4, 1805\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The second inauguration of Mr. Jefferson followed\r\nan election under which the offices of President and Vice President were\r\nto be separately sought, pursuant to the newly adopted 12th Amendment to\r\nthe Constitution. George Clinton of New York was elected Vice President.\r\nChief Justice John Marshall administered the oath of office in the\r\nSenate Chamber at the Capitol.]\r\n\r\n\r\nProceeding, fellow-citizens, to that qualification which the\r\nConstitution requires before my entrance on the charge again conferred\r\non me, it is my duty to express the deep sense I entertain of this new\r\nproof of confidence from my fellow-citizens at large, and the zeal with\r\nwhich it inspires me so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nOn taking this station on a former occasion I declared the principles on\r\nwhich I believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our\r\nCommonwealth. MY conscience tells me I have on every occasion acted up\r\nto that declaration according to its obvious import and to the\r\nunderstanding of every candid mind.\r\n\r\nIn the transaction of your foreign affairs we have endeavored to\r\ncultivate the friendship of all nations, and especially of those with\r\nwhich we have the most important relations. We have done them justice on\r\nall occasions, favored where favor was lawful, and cherished mutual\r\ninterests and intercourse on fair and equal terms. We are firmly\r\nconvinced, and we act on that conviction, that with nations as with\r\nindividuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found\r\ninseparable from our moral duties, and history bears witness to the fact\r\nthat a just nation is trusted on its word when recourse is had to\r\narmaments and wars to bridle others.\r\n\r\nAt home, fellow-citizens, you best know whether we have done well or\r\nill. The suppression of unnecessary offices, of useless establishments\r\nand expenses, enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes. These,\r\ncovering our land with officers and opening our doors to their\r\nintrusions, had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which\r\nonce entered is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively\r\nevery article of property and produce. If among these taxes some minor\r\nones fell which had not been inconvenient, it was because their amount\r\nwould not have paid the officers who collected them, and because, if\r\nthey had any merit, the State authorities might adopt them instead of\r\nothers less approved.\r\n\r\nThe remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles is paid\r\nchiefly by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic\r\ncomforts, being collected on our seaboard and frontiers only, and\r\nincorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens, it may be\r\nthe pleasure and the pride of an American to ask, What farmer, what\r\nmechanic, what laborer ever sees a taxgatherer of the United States?\r\nThese contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the\r\nGovernment, to fulfill contracts with foreign nations, to extinguish the\r\nnative right of soil within our limits, to extend those limits, and to\r\napply such a surplus to our public debts as places at a short day their\r\nfinal redemption, and that redemption once effected the revenue thereby\r\nliberated may, by a just repartition of it among the States and a\r\ncorresponding amendment of the Constitution, be applied in time of peace\r\nto rivers, canals, roads, arts, manufactures, education, and other great\r\nobjects within each State. In time of war, if injustice by ourselves or\r\nothers must sometimes produce war, increased as the same revenue will be\r\nby increased population and consumption, and aided by other resources\r\nreserved for that crisis, it may meet within the year all the expenses\r\nof the year without encroaching on the rights of future generations by\r\nburthening them with the debts of the past. War will then be but a\r\nsuspension of useful works, and a return to a state of peace, a return\r\nto the progress of improvement.\r\n\r\nI have said, fellow-citizens, that the income reserved had enabled us to\r\nextend our limits, but that extension may possibly pay for itself before\r\nwe are called on, and in the meantime may keep down the accruing\r\ninterest; in all events, it will replace the advances we shall have\r\nmade. I know that the acquisition of Louisiana had been disapproved by\r\nsome from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory\r\nwould endanger its union. But who can limit the extent to which the\r\nfederative principle may operate effectively? The larger our association\r\nthe less will it be shaken by local passions; and in any view is it not\r\nbetter that the opposite bank of the Mississippi should be settled by\r\nour own brethren and children than by strangers of another family? With\r\nwhich should we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly\r\nintercourse?\r\n\r\nIn matters of religion I have considered that its free exercise is\r\nplaced by the Constitution independent of the powers of the General\r\nGovernment. I have therefore undertaken on no occasion to prescribe the\r\nreligious exercises suited to it, but have left them, as the\r\nConstitution found them, under the direction and discipline of the\r\nchurch or state authorities acknowledged by the several religious\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nThe aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with the\r\ncommiseration their history inspires. Endowed with the faculties and the\r\nrights of men, breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence, and\r\noccupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed, the\r\nstream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on\r\nthese shores; without power to divert or habits to contend against it,\r\nthey have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it; now\r\nreduced within limits too narrow for the hunter's state, humanity\r\nenjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts; to encourage\r\nthem to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their\r\nplace in existence and to prepare them in time for that state of society\r\nwhich to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind and morals. We\r\nhave therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry\r\nand household use; we have placed among them instructors in the arts of\r\nfirst necessity, and they are covered with the aegis of the law against\r\naggressors from among ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their\r\npresent course of life, to induce them to exercise their reason, follow\r\nits dictates, and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances\r\nhave powerful obstacles to encounter; they are combated by the habits of\r\ntheir bodies, prejudices of their minds, ignorance, pride, and the\r\ninfluence of interested and crafty individuals among them who feel\r\nthemselves something in the present order of things and fear to become\r\nnothing in any other. These persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence\r\nfor the customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever they did must be\r\ndone through all time; that reason is a false guide, and to advance\r\nunder its counsel in their physical, moral, or political condition is\r\nperilous innovation; that their duty is to remain as their Creator made\r\nthem, ignorance being safety and knowledge full of danger; in short, my\r\nfriends, among them also is seen the action and counteraction of good\r\nsense and of bigotry; they too have their antiphilosophists who find an\r\ninterest in keeping things in their present state, who dread\r\nreformation, and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of\r\nhabit over the duty of improving our reason and obeying its mandates.\r\n\r\nIn giving these outlines I do not mean, fellow-citizens, to arrogate to\r\nmyself the merit of the measures. That is due, in the first place, to\r\nthe reflecting character of our citizens at large, who, by the weight of\r\npublic opinion, influence and strengthen the public measures. It is due\r\nto the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves\r\nthose to whom they confide the legislative duties. It is due to the zeal\r\nand wisdom of the characters thus selected, who lay the foundations of\r\npublic happiness in wholesome laws, the execution of which alone remains\r\nfor others, and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries, whose\r\npatriotism has associated them with me in the executive functions.\r\n\r\nDuring this course of administration, and in order to disturb it, the\r\nartillery of the press has been leveled against us, charged with\r\nwhatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare. These abuses of an\r\ninstitution so important to freedom and science are deeply to be\r\nregretted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap its\r\nsafety. They might, indeed, have been corrected by the wholesome\r\npunishments reserved to and provided by the laws of the several States\r\nagainst falsehood and defamation, but public duties more urgent press on\r\nthe time of public servants, and the offenders have therefore been left\r\nto find their punishment in the public indignation.\r\n\r\nNor was it uninteresting to the world that an experiment should be\r\nfairly and fully made, whether freedom of discussion, unaided by power,\r\nis not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth--whether a\r\ngovernment conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution,\r\nwith zeal and purity, and doing no act which it would be unwilling the\r\nwhole world should witness, can be written down by falsehood and\r\ndefamation. The experiment has been tried; you have witnessed the scene;\r\nour fellow-citizens looked on, cool and collected; they saw the latent\r\nsource from which these outrages proceeded; they gathered around their\r\npublic functionaries, and when the Constitution called them to the\r\ndecision by suffrage, they pronounced their verdict, honorable to those\r\nwho had served them and consolatory to the friend of man who believes\r\nthat he may be trusted with the control of his own affairs.\r\n\r\nNo inference is here intended that the laws provided by the States\r\nagainst false and defamatory publications should not be enforced; he who\r\nhas time renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity in\r\nreforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law; but the\r\nexperiment is noted to prove that, since truth and reason have\r\nmaintained their ground against false opinions in league with false\r\nfacts, the press, confined to truth, needs no other legal restraint; the\r\npublic judgment will correct false reasoning and opinions on a full\r\nhearing of all parties; and no other definite line can be drawn between\r\nthe inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing\r\nlicentiousness. If there be still improprieties which this rule would\r\nnot restrain, its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nContemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally as\r\nauguring harmony and happiness to our future course, I offer to our\r\ncountry sincere congratulations. With those, too, not yet rallied to the\r\nsame point the disposition to do so is gaining strength; facts are\r\npiercing through the veil drawn over them, and our doubting brethren\r\nwill at length see that the mass of their fellow-citizens with whom they\r\ncan not yet resolve to act as to principles and measures, think as they\r\nthink and desire what they desire; that our wish as well as theirs is\r\nthat the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good,\r\nthat peace be cultivated, civil and religious liberty unassailed, law\r\nand order preserved, equality of rights maintained, and that state of\r\nproperty, equal or unequal, which results to every man from his own\r\nindustry or that of his father's. When satisfied of these views it is\r\nnot in human nature that they should not approve and support them. In\r\nthe meantime let us cherish them with patient affection, let us do them\r\njustice, and more than justice, in all competitions of interest; and we\r\nneed not doubt that truth, reason, and their own interests will at\r\nlength prevail, will gather them into the fold of their country, and\r\nwill complete that entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the\r\nblessing of harmony and the benefit of all its strength.\r\n\r\nI shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow-citizens have again\r\ncalled me, and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which\r\nthey have approved. I fear not that any motives of interest may lead me\r\nastray; I am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from\r\nthe path of justice, but the weaknesses of human nature and the limits\r\nof my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes\r\ninjurious to your interests. I shall need, therefore, all the indulgence\r\nwhich I have heretofore experienced from my constituents; the want of it\r\nwill certainly not lessen with increasing years. I shall need, too, the\r\nfavor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as\r\nIsrael of old, from their native land and planted them in a country\r\nflowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered\r\nour infancy with His providence and our riper years with His wisdom and\r\npower, and to whose goodness I ask you to join in supplications with me\r\nthat He will so enlighten the minds of your servants, guide their\r\ncouncils, and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shall\r\nresult in your good, and shall secure to you the peace, friendship, and\r\napprobation of all nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1809\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  Chief Justice John Marshall administered the oath\r\nof office in the Hall of the House of Representatives (now National\r\nStatuary Hall). Subsequently the oath by Presidents-elect, with few\r\nexceptions, was taken in the House Chamber or in a place of the Capitol\r\nassociated with the Congress as a whole. The Vice Presidential oath of\r\noffice for most administrations was taken in the Senate Chamber.\r\nPresident Jefferson watched the ceremony, but he joined the crowd of\r\nassembled visitors since he no longer was an office-holder. The mild\r\nMarch weather drew a crowd of about 10,000 persons.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUnwilling to depart from examples of the most revered authority, I avail\r\nmyself of the occasion now presented to express the profound impression\r\nmade on me by the call of my country to the station to the duties of\r\nwhich I am about to pledge myself by the most solemn of sanctions. So\r\ndistinguished a mark of confidence, proceeding from the deliberate and\r\ntranquil suffrage of a free and virtuous nation, would under any\r\ncircumstances have commanded my gratitude and devotion, as well as\r\nfilled me with an awful sense of the trust to be assumed. Under the\r\nvarious circumstances which give peculiar solemnity to the existing\r\nperiod, I feel that both the honor and the responsibility allotted to me\r\nare inexpressibly enhanced.\r\n\r\nThe present situation of the world is indeed without a parallel and that\r\nof our own country full of difficulties. The pressure of these, too, is\r\nthe more severely felt because they have fallen upon us at a moment when\r\nthe national prosperity being at a height not before attained, the\r\ncontrast resulting from the change has been rendered the more striking.\r\nUnder the benign influence of our republican institutions, and the\r\nmaintenance of peace with all nations whilst so many of them were\r\nengaged in bloody and wasteful wars, the fruits of a just policy were\r\nenjoyed in an unrivaled growth of our faculties and resources. Proofs of\r\nthis were seen in the improvements of agriculture, in the successful\r\nenterprises of commerce, in the progress of manufacturers and useful\r\narts, in the increase of the public revenue and the use made of it in\r\nreducing the public debt, and in the valuable works and establishments\r\neverywhere multiplying over the face of our land.\r\n\r\nIt is a precious reflection that the transition from this prosperous\r\ncondition of our country to the scene which has for some time been\r\ndistressing us is not chargeable on any unwarrantable views, nor, as I\r\ntrust, on any involuntary errors in the public councils. Indulging no\r\npassions which trespass on the rights or the repose of other nations, it\r\nhas been the true glory of the United States to cultivate peace by\r\nobserving justice, and to entitle themselves to the respect of the\r\nnations at war by fulfilling their neutral obligations with the most\r\nscrupulous impartiality. If there be candor in the world, the truth of\r\nthese assertions will not be questioned; posterity at least will do\r\njustice to them.\r\n\r\nThis unexceptionable course could not avail against the injustice and\r\nviolence of the belligerent powers. In their rage against each other, or\r\nimpelled by more direct motives, principles of retaliation have been\r\nintroduced equally contrary to universal reason and acknowledged law.\r\nHow long their arbitrary edicts will be continued in spite of the\r\ndemonstrations that not even a pretext for them has been given by the\r\nUnited States, and of the fair and liberal attempt to induce a\r\nrevocation of them, can not be anticipated. Assuring myself that under\r\nevery vicissitude the determined spirit and united councils of the\r\nnation will be safeguards to its honor and its essential interests, I\r\nrepair to the post assigned me with no other discouragement than what\r\nsprings from my own inadequacy to its high duties. If I do not sink\r\nunder the weight of this deep conviction it is because I find some\r\nsupport in a consciousness of the purposes and a confidence in the\r\nprinciples which I bring with me into this arduous service.\r\n\r\nTo cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nations having\r\ncorrespondent dispositions; to maintain sincere neutrality toward\r\nbelligerent nations; to prefer in all cases amicable discussion and\r\nreasonable accommodation of differences to a decision of them by an\r\nappeal to arms; to exclude foreign intrigues and foreign partialities,\r\nso degrading to all countries and so baneful to free ones; to foster a\r\nspirit of independence too just to invade the rights of others, too\r\nproud to surrender our own, too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudices\r\nourselves and too elevated not to look down upon them in others; to hold\r\nthe union of the States as the basis of their peace and happiness; to\r\nsupport the Constitution, which is the cement of the Union, as well in\r\nits limitations as in its authorities; to respect the rights and\r\nauthorities reserved to the States and to the people as equally\r\nincorporated with and essential to the success of the general system; to\r\navoid the slightest interference with the right of conscience or the\r\nfunctions of religion, so wisely exempted from civil jurisdiction; to\r\npreserve in their full energy the other salutary provisions in behalf of\r\nprivate and personal rights, and of the freedom of the press; to observe\r\neconomy in public expenditures; to liberate the public resources by an\r\nhonorable discharge of the public debts; to keep within the requisite\r\nlimits a standing military force, always remembering that an armed and\r\ntrained militia is the firmest bulwark of republics--that without\r\nstanding armies their liberty can never be in danger, nor with large\r\nones safe; to promote by authorized means improvements friendly to\r\nagriculture, to manufactures, and to external as well as internal\r\ncommerce; to favor in like manner the advancement of science and the\r\ndiffusion of information as the best aliment to true liberty; to carry\r\non the benevolent plans which have been so meritoriously applied to the\r\nconversion of our aboriginal neighbors from the degradation and\r\nwretchedness of savage life to a participation of the improvements of\r\nwhich the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized\r\nstate--as far as sentiments and intentions such as these can aid the\r\nfulfillment of my duty, they will be a resource which can not fail me.\r\n\r\nIt is my good fortune, moreover, to have the path in which I am to tread\r\nlighted by examples of illustrious services successfully rendered in the\r\nmost trying difficulties by those who have marched before me. Of those\r\nof my immediate predecessor it might least become me here to speak. I\r\nmay, however, be pardoned for not suppressing the sympathy with which my\r\nheart is full in the rich reward he enjoys in the benedictions of a\r\nbeloved country, gratefully bestowed or exalted talents zealously\r\ndevoted through a long career to the advancement of its highest interest\r\nand happiness.\r\n\r\nBut the source to which I look or the aids which alone can supply my\r\ndeficiencies is in the well-tried intelligence and virtue of my\r\nfellow-citizens, and in the counsels of those representing them in the\r\nother departments associated in the care of the national interests. In\r\nthese my confidence will under every difficulty be best placed, next to\r\nthat which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and\r\nguidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of\r\nnations, whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this\r\nrising Republic, and to whom we are bound to address our devout\r\ngratitude for the past, as well as our fervent supplications and best\r\nhopes for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MADISON, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1813\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  Chief Justice John Marshall administered the oath\r\nof office in the Hall of the House of Representatives. The United States\r\nwas at war with Great Britain at the time of James Madison's second\r\ninauguration. Most of the battles had occurred at sea, and the physical\r\nreminders of war seemed remote to the group assembled at the Capitol. In\r\nlittle more than a year, however, both the Capitol and Executive Mansion\r\nwould be burned by an invading British garrison, and the city thrown\r\ninto a panic.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout to add the solemnity of an oath to the obligations imposed by a\r\nsecond call to the station in which my country heretofore placed me, I\r\nfind in the presence of this respectable assembly an opportunity of\r\npublicly repeating my profound sense of so distinguished a confidence\r\nand of the responsibility united with it. The impressions on me are\r\nstrengthened by such an evidence that my faithful endeavors to discharge\r\nmy arduous duties have been favorably estimated, and by a consideration\r\nof the momentous period at which the trust has been renewed. From the\r\nweight and magnitude now belonging to it I should be compelled to shrink\r\nif I had less reliance on the support of an enlightened and generous\r\npeople, and felt less deeply a conviction that the war with a powerful\r\nnation, which forms so prominent a feature in our situation, is stamped\r\nwith that justice which invites the smiles of Heaven on the means of\r\nconducting it to a successful termination.\r\n\r\nMay we not cherish this sentiment without presumption when we reflect on\r\nthe characters by which this war is distinguished?\r\n\r\nIt was not declared on the part of the United States until it had been\r\nlong made on them, in reality though not in name; until arguments and\r\npostulations had been exhausted; until a positive declaration had been\r\nreceived that the wrongs provoking it would not be discontinued; nor\r\nuntil this last appeal could no longer be delayed without breaking down\r\nthe spirit of the nation, destroying all confidence in itself and in its\r\npolitical institutions, and either perpetuating a state of disgraceful\r\nsuffering or regaining by more costly sacrifices and more severe\r\nstruggles our lost rank and respect among independent powers.\r\n\r\nOn the issue of the war are staked our national sovereignty on the high\r\nseas and the security of an important class of citizens whose\r\noccupations give the proper value to those of every other class. Not to\r\ncontend for such a stake is to surrender our equality with other powers\r\non the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every\r\nmember of the society has to its protection. I need not call into view\r\nthe unlawfulness of the practice by which our mariners are forced at the\r\nwill of every cruising officer from their own vessels into foreign ones,\r\nnor paint the outrages inseparable from it. The proofs are in the\r\nrecords of each successive Administration of our Government, and the\r\ncruel sufferings of that portion of the American people have found their\r\nway to every bosom not dead to the sympathies of human nature.\r\n\r\nAs the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its\r\nobjects, we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on\r\nno principle of justice or honor, no usage of civilized nations, no\r\nprecept of courtesy or humanity, have been infringed. The war has been\r\nwaged on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligations, and\r\nin a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed.\r\n\r\nHow little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the\r\nenemy!\r\n\r\nThey have retained as prisoners of war citizens of the United States not\r\nliable to be so considered under the usages of war.\r\n\r\nThey have refused to consider as prisoners of war, and threatened to\r\npunish as traitors and deserters, persons emigrating without restraint\r\nto the United States, incorporated by naturalization into our political\r\nfamily, and fighting under the authority of their adopted country in\r\nopen and honorable war for the maintenance of its rights and safety.\r\nSuch is the avowed purpose of a Government which is in the practice of\r\nnaturalizing by thousands citizens of other countries, and not only of\r\npermitting but compelling them to fight its battles against their native\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThey have not, it is true, taken into their own hands the hatchet and\r\nthe knife, devoted to indiscriminate massacre, but they have let loose\r\nthe savages armed with these cruel instruments; have allured them into\r\ntheir service, and carried them to battle by their sides, eager to glut\r\ntheir savage thirst with the blood of the vanquished and to finish the\r\nwork of torture and death on maimed and defenseless captives. And, what\r\nwas never before seen, British commanders have extorted victory over the\r\nunconquerable valor of our troops by presenting to the sympathy of their\r\nchief captives awaiting massacre from their savage associates. And now\r\nwe find them, in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare,\r\nsupplying the place of a conquering force by attempts to disorganize our\r\npolitical society, to dismember our confederated Republic. Happily, like\r\nothers, these will recoil on the authors; but they mark the degenerate\r\ncounsels from which they emanate, and if they did not belong to a sense\r\nof unexampled inconsistencies might excite the greater wonder as\r\nproceeding from a Government which founded the very war in which it has\r\nbeen so long engaged on a charge against the disorganizing and\r\ninsurrectional policy of its adversary.\r\n\r\nTo render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous, the\r\nreluctance to commence it was followed by the earliest and strongest\r\nmanifestations of a disposition to arrest its progress. The sword was\r\nscarcely out of the scabbard before the enemy was apprised of the\r\nreasonable terms on which it would be resheathed. Still more precise\r\nadvances were repeated, and have been received in a spirit forbidding\r\nevery reliance not placed on the military resources of the nation.\r\n\r\nThese resources are amply sufficient to bring the war to an honorable\r\nissue. Our nation is in number more than half that of the British Isles.\r\nIt is composed of a brave, a free, a virtuous, and an intelligent\r\npeople. Our country abounds in the necessaries, the arts, and the\r\ncomforts of life. A general prosperity is visible in the public\r\ncountenance. The means employed by the British cabinet to undermine it\r\nhave recoiled on themselves; have given to our national faculties a more\r\nrapid development, and, draining or diverting the precious metals from\r\nBritish circulation and British vaults, have poured them into those of\r\nthe United States. It is a propitious consideration that an unavoidable\r\nwar should have found this seasonable facility for the contributions\r\nrequired to support it. When the public voice called for war, all knew,\r\nand still know, that without them it could not be carried on through the\r\nperiod which it might last, and the patriotism, the good sense, and the\r\nmanly spirit of our fellow-citizens are pledges for the cheerfulness\r\nwith which they will bear each his share of the common burden. To render\r\nthe war short and its success sure, animated and systematic exertions\r\nalone are necessary, and the success of our arms now may long preserve\r\nour country from the necessity of another resort to them. Already have\r\nthe gallant exploits of our naval heroes proved to the world our\r\ninherent capacity to maintain our rights on one element. If the\r\nreputation of our arms has been thrown under clouds on the other,\r\npresaging flashes of heroic enterprise assure us that nothing is wanting\r\nto correspondent triumphs there also but the discipline and habits which\r\nare in daily progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, MARCH 4, 1817\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: Because the Capitol was under reconstruction after\r\nthe fire, President-elect Monroe offered to take his oath of office in\r\nthe House Chamber of the temporary \"Brick Capitol,\" located on the site\r\nwhere the Supreme Court building now stands. A controversy resulted from\r\nthe inaugural committees proposals concerning the use of the House\r\nChamber on the second floor of the brick building. Speaker Henry Clay\r\ndeclined the use of the hall and suggested that the proceedings be held\r\noutside. The President's speech to the crowd from a platform adjacent to\r\nthe brick building was the first outdoor inaugural address. Chief\r\nJustice John Marshall administered the oath of office.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI should be destitute of feeling if I was not deeply affected by the\r\nstrong proof which my fellow-citizens have given me of their confidence\r\nin calling me to the high office whose functions I am about to assume.\r\nAs the expression of their good opinion of my conduct in the public\r\nservice, I derive from it a gratification which those who are conscious\r\nof having done all that they could to merit it can alone feel. MY\r\nsensibility is increased by a just estimate of the importance of the\r\ntrust and of the nature and extent of its duties, with the proper\r\ndischarge of which the highest interests of a great and free people are\r\nintimately connected. Conscious of my own deficiency, I cannot enter on\r\nthese duties without great anxiety for the result. From a just\r\nresponsibility I will never shrink, calculating with confidence that in\r\nmy best efforts to promote the public welfare my motives will always be\r\nduly appreciated and my conduct be viewed with that candor and\r\nindulgence which I have experienced in other stations.\r\n\r\nIn commencing the duties of the chief executive office it has been the\r\npractice of the distinguished men who have gone before me to explain the\r\nprinciples which would govern them in their respective Administrations.\r\nIn following their venerated example my attention is naturally drawn to\r\nthe great causes which have contributed in a principal degree to produce\r\nthe present happy condition of the United States. They will best explain\r\nthe nature of our duties and shed much light on the policy which ought\r\nto be pursued in future.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of our Revolution to the present day almost forty\r\nyears have elapsed, and from the establishment of this Constitution\r\ntwenty-eight. Through this whole term the Government has been what may\r\nemphatically be called self-government. And what has been the effect? To\r\nwhatever object we turn our attention, whether it relates to our foreign\r\nor domestic concerns, we find abundant cause to felicitate ourselves in\r\nthe excellence of our institutions. During a period fraught with\r\ndifficulties and marked by very extraordinary events the United States\r\nhave flourished beyond example. Their citizens individually have been\r\nhappy and the nation prosperous.\r\n\r\nUnder this Constitution our commerce has been wisely regulated with\r\nforeign nations and between the States; new States have been admitted\r\ninto our Union; our territory has been enlarged by fair and honorable\r\ntreaty, and with great advantage to the original States; the States,\r\nrespectively protected by the National Government under a mild, parental\r\nsystem against foreign dangers, and enjoying within their separate\r\nspheres, by a wise partition of power, a just proportion of the\r\nsovereignty, have improved their police, extended their settlements, and\r\nattained a strength and maturity which are the best proofs of wholesome\r\nlaws well administered. And if we look to the condition of individuals\r\nwhat a proud spectacle does it exhibit! On whom has oppression fallen in\r\nany quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person\r\nor property? Who restrained from offering his vows in the mode which he\r\nprefers to the Divine Author of his being? It is well known that all\r\nthese blessings have been enjoyed in their fullest extent; and I add\r\nwith peculiar satisfaction that there has been no example of a capital\r\npunishment being inflicted on anyone for the crime of high treason.\r\n\r\nSome who might admit the competency of our Government to these\r\nbeneficent duties might doubt it in trials which put to the test its\r\nstrength and efficiency as a member of the great community of nations.\r\nHere too experience has afforded us the most satisfactory proof in its\r\nfavor. Just as this Constitution was put into action several of the\r\nprincipal States of Europe had become much agitated and some of them\r\nseriously convulsed. Destructive wars ensued, which have of late only\r\nbeen terminated. In the course of these conflicts the United States\r\nreceived great injury from several of the parties. It was their interest\r\nto stand aloof from the contest, to demand justice from the party\r\ncommitting the injury, and to cultivate by a fair and honorable conduct\r\nthe friendship of all. War became at length inevitable, and the result\r\nhas shown that our Government is equal to that, the greatest of trials,\r\nunder the most unfavorable circumstances. Of the virtue of the people\r\nand of the heroic exploits of the Army, the Navy, and the militia I need\r\nnot speak.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the happy Government under which we live--a Government\r\nadequate to every purpose for which the social compact is formed; a\r\nGovernment elective in all its branches, under which every citizen may\r\nby his merit obtain the highest trust recognized by the Constitution;\r\nwhich contains within it no cause of discord, none to put at variance\r\none portion of the community with another; a Government which protects\r\nevery citizen in the full enjoyment of his rights, and is able to\r\nprotect the nation against injustice from foreign powers.\r\n\r\nOther considerations of the highest importance admonish us to cherish\r\nour Union and to cling to the Government which supports it. Fortunate as\r\nwe are in our political institutions, we have not been less so in other\r\ncircumstances on which our prosperity and happiness essentially depend.\r\nSituated within the temperate zone, and extending through many degrees\r\nof latitude along the Atlantic, the United States enjoy all the\r\nvarieties of climate, and every production incident to that portion of\r\nthe globe. Penetrating internally to the Great Lakes and beyond the\r\nsources of the great rivers which communicate through our whole\r\ninterior, no country was ever happier with respect to its domain.\r\nBlessed, too, with a fertile soil, our produce has always been very\r\nabundant, leaving, even in years the least favorable, a surplus for the\r\nwants of our fellow-men in other countries. Such is our peculiar\r\nfelicity that there is not a part of our Union that is not particularly\r\ninterested in preserving it. The great agricultural interest of the\r\nnation prospers under its protection. Local interests are not less\r\nfostered by it. Our fellow-citizens of the North engaged in navigation\r\nfind great encouragement in being made the favored carriers of the vast\r\nproductions of the other portions of the United States, while the\r\ninhabitants of these are amply recompensed, in their turn, by the\r\nnursery for seamen and naval force thus formed and reared up for the\r\nsupport of our common rights. Our manufactures find a generous\r\nencouragement by the policy which patronizes domestic industry, and the\r\nsurplus of our produce a steady and profitable market by local wants in\r\nless-favored parts at home.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, being the highly favored condition of our country, it is the\r\ninterest of every citizen to maintain it. What are the dangers which\r\nmenace us? If any exist they ought to be ascertained and guarded\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\nIn explaining my sentiments on this subject it may be asked, What raised\r\nus to the present happy state? How did we accomplish the Revolution? How\r\nremedy the defects of the first instrument of our Union, by infusing\r\ninto the National Government sufficient power for national purposes,\r\nwithout impairing the just rights of the States or affecting those of\r\nindividuals? How sustain and pass with glory through the late war? The\r\nGovernment has been in the hands of the people. To the people,\r\ntherefore, and to the faithful and able depositaries of their trust is\r\nthe credit due. Had the people of the United States been educated in\r\ndifferent principles had they been less intelligent, less independent,\r\nor less virtuous can it be believed that we should have maintained the\r\nsame steady and consistent career or been blessed with the same success?\r\nWhile, then, the constituent body retains its present sound and\r\nhealthful state everything will be safe. They will choose competent and\r\nfaithful representatives for every department. It is only when the\r\npeople become ignorant and corrupt, when they degenerate into a\r\npopulace, that they are incapable of exercising the sovereignty.\r\nUsurpation is then an easy attainment, and an usurper soon found. The\r\npeople themselves become the willing instruments of their own debasement\r\nand ruin. Let us, then, look to the great cause, and endeavor to\r\npreserve it in full force. Let us by all wise and constitutional\r\nmeasures promote intelligence among the people as the best means of\r\npreserving our liberties.\r\n\r\nDangers from abroad are not less deserving of attention. Experiencing\r\nthe fortune of other nations, the United States may be again involved in\r\nwar, and it may in that event be the object of the adverse party to\r\noverset our Government, to break our Union, and demolish us as a nation.\r\nOur distance from Europe and the just, moderate, and pacific policy of\r\nour Government may form some security against these dangers, but they\r\nought to be anticipated and guarded against. Many of our citizens are\r\nengaged in commerce and navigation, and all of them are in a certain\r\ndegree dependent on their prosperous state. Many are engaged in the\r\nfisheries. These interests are exposed to invasion in the wars between\r\nother powers, and we should disregard the faithful admonition of\r\nexperience if we did not expect it. We must support our rights or lose\r\nour character, and with it, perhaps, our liberties. A people who fail to\r\ndo it can scarcely be said to hold a place among independent nations.\r\nNational honor is national property of the highest value. The sentiment\r\nin the mind of every citizen is national strength. It ought therefore to\r\nbe cherished.\r\n\r\nTo secure us against these dangers our coast and inland frontiers should\r\nbe fortified, our Army and Navy, regulated upon just principles as to\r\nthe force of each, be kept in perfect order, and our militia be placed\r\non the best practicable footing. To put our extensive coast in such a\r\nstate of defense as to secure our cities and interior from invasion will\r\nbe attended with expense, but the work when finished will be permanent,\r\nand it is fair to presume that a single campaign of invasion by a naval\r\nforce superior to our own, aided by a few thousand land troops, would\r\nexpose us to greater expense, without taking into the estimate the loss\r\nof property and distress of our citizens, than would be sufficient for\r\nthis great work. Our land and naval forces should be moderate, but\r\nadequate to the necessary purposes--the former to garrison and preserve\r\nour fortifications and to meet the first invasions of a foreign foe,\r\nand, while constituting the elements of a greater force, to preserve the\r\nscience as well as all the necessary implements of war in a state to be\r\nbrought into activity in the event of war; the latter, retained within\r\nthe limits proper in a state of peace, might aid in maintaining the\r\nneutrality of the United States with dignity in the wars of other powers\r\nand in saving the property of their citizens from spoliation. In time of\r\nwar, with the enlargement of which the great naval resources of the\r\ncountry render it susceptible, and which should be duly fostered in\r\ntime of peace, it would contribute essentially, both as an auxiliary of\r\ndefense and as a powerful engine of annoyance, to diminish the\r\ncalamities of war and to bring the war to a speedy and honorable\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\nBut it ought always to be held prominently in view that the safety of\r\nthese States and of everything dear to a free people must depend in an\r\neminent degree on the militia. Invasions may be made too formidable to\r\nbe resisted by any land and naval force which it would comport either\r\nwith the principles of our Government or the circumstances of the United\r\nStates to maintain. In such cases recourse must be had to the great body\r\nof the people, and in a manner to produce the best effect. It is of the\r\nhighest importance, therefore, that they be so organized and trained as\r\nto be prepared for any emergency. The arrangement should be such as to\r\nput at the command of the Government the ardent patriotism and youthful\r\nvigor of the country. If formed on equal and just principles, it can not\r\nbe oppressive. It is the crisis which makes the pressure, and not the\r\nlaws which provide a remedy for it. This arrangement should be formed,\r\ntoo, in time of peace, to be the better prepared for war. With such an\r\norganization of such a people the United States have nothing to dread\r\nfrom foreign invasion. At its approach an overwhelming force of gallant\r\nmen might always be put in motion.\r\n\r\nOther interests of high importance will claim attention, among which the\r\nimprovement of our country by roads and canals, proceeding always with a\r\nconstitutional sanction, holds a distinguished place. By thus\r\nfacilitating the intercourse between the States we shall add much to the\r\nconvenience and comfort of our fellow-citizens, much to the ornament of\r\nthe country, and, what is of greater importance, we shall shorten\r\ndistances, and, by making each part more accessible to and dependent on\r\nthe other, we shall bind the Union more closely together. Nature has\r\ndone so much for us by intersecting the country with so many great\r\nrivers, bays, and lakes, approaching from distant points so near to each\r\nother, that the inducement to complete the work seems to be peculiarly\r\nstrong. A more interesting spectacle was perhaps never seen than is\r\nexhibited within the limits of the United States--a territory so vast\r\nand advantageously situated, containing objects so grand, so useful, so\r\nhappily connected in all their parts!\r\n\r\nOur manufacturers will likewise require the systematic and fostering\r\ncare of the Government. Possessing as we do all the raw materials, the\r\nfruit of our own soil and industry, we ought not to depend in the degree\r\nwe have done on supplies from other countries. While we are thus\r\ndependent the sudden event of war, unsought and unexpected, can not fail\r\nto plunge us into the most serious difficulties. It is important, too,\r\nthat the capital which nourishes our manufacturers should be domestic,\r\nas its influence in that case instead of exhausting, as it may do in\r\nforeign hands, would be felt advantageously on agriculture and every\r\nother branch of industry. Equally important is it to provide at home a\r\nmarket for our raw materials, as by extending the competition it will\r\nenhance the price and protect the cultivator against the casualties\r\nincident to foreign markets.\r\n\r\nWith the Indian tribes it is our duty to cultivate friendly relations\r\nand to act with kindness and liberality in all our transactions. Equally\r\nproper is it to persevere in our efforts to extend to them the\r\nadvantages of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe great amount of our revenue and the flourishing state of the\r\nTreasury are a full proof of the competency of the national resources\r\nfor any emergency, as they are of the willingness of our fellow-citizens\r\nto bear the burdens which the public necessities require. The vast\r\namount of vacant lands, the value of which daily augments, forms an\r\nadditional resource of great extent and duration. These resources,\r\nbesides accomplishing every other necessary purpose, put it completely\r\nin the power of the United States to discharge the national debt at an\r\nearly period. Peace is the best time for improvement and preparation of\r\nevery kind; it is in peace that our commerce flourishes most, that taxes\r\nare most easily paid, and that the revenue is most productive.\r\n\r\nThe Executive is charged officially in the Departments under it with the\r\ndisbursement of the public money, and is responsible for the faithful\r\napplication of it to the purposes for which it is raised. The\r\nLegislature is the watchful guardian over the public purse. It is its\r\nduty to see that the disbursement has been honestly made. To meet the\r\nrequisite responsibility every facility should be afforded to the\r\nExecutive to enable it to bring the public agents intrusted with the\r\npublic money strictly and promptly to account. Nothing should be\r\npresumed against them; but if, with the requisite facilities, the public\r\nmoney is suffered to lie long and uselessly in their hands, they will\r\nnot be the only defaulters, nor will the demoralizing effect be confined\r\nto them. It will evince a relaxation and want of tone in the\r\nAdministration which will be felt by the whole community. I shall do all\r\nI can to secure economy and fidelity in this important branch of the\r\nAdministration, and I doubt not that the Legislature will perform its\r\nduty with equal zeal. A thorough examination should be regularly made,\r\nand I will promote it.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly gratifying to me to enter on the discharge of these\r\nduties at a time when the United States are blessed with peace. It is a\r\nstate most consistent with their prosperity and happiness. It will be my\r\nsincere desire to preserve it, so far as depends on the Executive, on\r\njust principles with all nations, claiming nothing unreasonable of any\r\nand rendering to each what is its due.\r\n\r\nEqually gratifying is it to witness the increased harmony of opinion\r\nwhich pervades our Union. Discord does not belong to our system. Union\r\nis recommended as well by the free and benign principles of our\r\nGovernment, extending its blessings to every individual, as by the other\r\neminent advantages attending it. The American people have encountered\r\ntogether great dangers and sustained severe trials with success. They\r\nconstitute one great family with a common interest. Experience has\r\nenlightened us on some questions of essential importance to the country.\r\nThe progress has been slow, dictated by a just reflection and a faithful\r\nregard to every interest connected with it. To promote this harmony in\r\naccord with the principles of our republican Government and in a manner\r\nto give them the most complete effect, and to advance in all other\r\nrespects the best interests of our Union, will be the object of my\r\nconstant and zealous exertions.\r\n\r\nNever did a government commence under auspices so favorable, nor ever\r\nwas success so complete. If we look to the history of other nations,\r\nancient or modern, we find no example of a growth so rapid, so gigantic,\r\nof a people so prosperous and happy. In contemplating what we have still\r\nto perform, the heart of every citizen must expand with joy when he\r\nreflects how near our Government has approached to perfection; that in\r\nrespect to it we have no essential improvement to make; that the great\r\nobject is to preserve it in the essential principles and features which\r\ncharacterize it, and that is to be done by preserving the virtue and\r\nenlightening the minds of the people; and as a security against foreign\r\ndangers to adopt such arrangements as are indispensable to the support\r\nof our independence, our rights and liberties. If we persevere in the\r\ncareer in which we have advanced so far and in the path already traced,\r\nwe can not fail, under the favor of a gracious Providence, to attain the\r\nhigh destiny which seems to await us.\r\n\r\nIn the Administrations of the illustrious men who have preceded me in\r\nthis high station, with some of whom I have been connected by the\r\nclosest ties from early life, examples are presented which will always\r\nbe found highly instructive and useful to their successors. From these I\r\nshall endeavor to derive all the advantages which they may afford. Of my\r\nimmediate predecessor, under whom so important a portion of this great\r\nand successful experiment has been made, I shall be pardoned for\r\nexpressing my earnest wishes that he may long enjoy in his retirement\r\nthe affections of a grateful country, the best reward of exalted talents\r\nand the most faithful and meritorious service. Relying on the aid to be\r\nderived from the other departments of the Government, I enter on the\r\ntrust to which I have been called by the suffrages of my fellow-citizens\r\nwith my fervent prayers to the Almighty that He will be graciously\r\npleased to continue to us that protection which He has already so\r\nconspicuously displayed in our favor.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES MONROE, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MARCH 5, 1821\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  In 1821, March 4 fell on a Sunday for the first\r\ntime that presidential inaugurations had been observed. Although his\r\nprevious term had expired on Saturday, the President waited until the\r\nfollowing Monday upon the advice of Chief Justice Marshall, before going\r\nto the newly rebuilt Hall of the House of Representatives to take the\r\noath of office. Because the weather was cold and wet, the ceremonies\r\nwere conducted indoors. The change in the location caused some confusion\r\nand many visitors and dignitaries were unable to find a place to stand\r\ninside the building.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to describe the grateful emotions which the new and\r\nvery distinguished proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens,\r\nevinced by my reelection to this high trust, has excited in my bosom.\r\nThe approbation which it announces of my conduct in the preceding term\r\naffords me a consolation which I shall profoundly feel through life. The\r\ngeneral accord with which it has been expressed adds to the great and\r\nnever-ceasing obligations which it imposes. To merit the continuance of\r\nthis good opinion, and to carry it with me into my retirement as the\r\nsolace of advancing years, will be the object of my most zealous and\r\nunceasing efforts.\r\n\r\nHaving no pretensions to the high and commanding claims of my\r\npredecessors, whose names are so much more conspicuously identified with\r\nour Revolution, and who contributed so preeminently to promote its\r\nsuccess, I consider myself rather as the instrument than the cause of\r\nthe union which has prevailed in the late election. In surmounting, in\r\nfavor of my humble pretensions, the difficulties which so often produce\r\ndivision in like occurrences, it is obvious that other powerful causes,\r\nindicating the great strength and stability of our Union, have\r\nessentially contributed to draw you together. That these powerful causes\r\nexist, and that they are permanent, is my fixed opinion; that they may\r\nproduce a like accord in all questions touching, however remotely, the\r\nliberty, prosperity and happiness of our country will always be the\r\nobject of my most fervent prayers to the Supreme Author of All Good.\r\n\r\nIn a government which is founded by the people, who possess exclusively\r\nthe sovereignty, it seems proper that the person who may be placed by\r\ntheir suffrages in this high trust should declare on commencing its\r\nduties the principles on which he intends to conduct the Administration.\r\nIf the person thus elected has served the preceding term, an opportunity\r\nis afforded him to review its principal occurrences and to give such\r\nfurther explanation respecting them as in his judgment may be useful to\r\nhis constituents. The events of one year have influence on those of\r\nanother, and, in like manner, of a preceding on the succeeding\r\nAdministration. The movements of a great nation are connected in all\r\ntheir parts. If errors have been committed they ought to be corrected;\r\nif the policy is sound it ought to be supported. It is by a thorough\r\nknowledge of the whole subject that our fellow-citizens are enabled to\r\njudge correctly of the past and to give a proper direction to the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nJust before the commencement of the last term the United States had\r\nconcluded a war with a very powerful nation on conditions equal and\r\nhonorable to both parties. The events of that war are too recent and too\r\ndeeply impressed on the memory of all to require a development from me.\r\nOur commerce had been in a great measure driven from the sea, our\r\nAtlantic and inland frontiers were invaded in almost every part; the\r\nwaste of life along our coast and on some parts of our inland frontiers,\r\nto the defense of which our gallant and patriotic citizens were called,\r\nwas immense, in addition to which not less than $120,000,000 were added\r\nat its end to the public debt.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the war had terminated, the nation, admonished by its events,\r\nresolved to place itself in a situation which should be better\r\ncalculated to prevent the recurrence of a like evil, and, in case it\r\nshould recur, to mitigate its calamities. With this view, after reducing\r\nour land force to the basis of a peace establishment, which has been\r\nfurther modified since, provision was made for the construction of\r\nfortifications at proper points through the whole extent of our coast\r\nand such an augmentation of our naval force as should be well adapted to\r\nboth purposes. The laws making this provision were passed in 1815 and\r\n1816, and it has been since the constant effort of the Executive to\r\ncarry them into effect.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of these fortifications and of an augmented naval force in\r\nthe extent contemplated, in a point of economy, has been fully\r\nillustrated by a report of the Board of Engineers and Naval\r\nCommissioners lately communicated to Congress, by which it appears that\r\nin an invasion by 20,000 men, with a correspondent naval force, in a\r\ncampaign of six months only, the whole expense of the construction of\r\nthe works would be defrayed by the difference in the sum necessary to\r\nmaintain the force which would be adequate to our defense with the aid\r\nof those works and that which would be incurred without them. The reason\r\nof this difference is obvious. If fortifications are judiciously placed\r\non our great inlets, as distant from our cities as circumstances will\r\npermit, they will form the only points of attack, and the enemy will be\r\ndetained there by a small regular force a sufficient time to enable our\r\nmilitia to collect and repair to that on which the attack is made. A\r\nforce adequate to the enemy, collected at that single point, with\r\nsuitable preparation for such others as might be menaced, is all that\r\nwould be requisite. But if there were no fortifications, then the enemy\r\nmight go where he pleased, and, changing his position and sailing from\r\nplace to place, our force must be called out and spread in vast numbers\r\nalong the whole coast and on both sides of every bay and river as high\r\nup in each as it might be navigable for ships of war. By these\r\nfortifications, supported by our Navy, to which they would afford like\r\nsupport, we should present to other powers an armed front from St. Croix\r\nto the Sabine, which would protect in the event of war our whole coast\r\nand interior from invasion; and even in the wars of other powers, in\r\nwhich we were neutral, they would be found eminently useful, as, by\r\nkeeping their public ships at a distance from our cities, peace and\r\norder in them would be preserved and the Government be protected from\r\ninsult.\r\n\r\nIt need scarcely be remarked that these measures have not been resorted\r\nto in a spirit of hostility to other powers. Such a disposition does not\r\nexist toward any power. Peace and good will have been, and will\r\nhereafter be, cultivated with all, and by the most faithful regard to\r\njustice. They have been dictated by a love of peace, of economy, and an\r\nearnest desire to save the lives of our fellow-citizens from that\r\ndestruction and our country from that devastation which are inseparable\r\nfrom war when it finds us unprepared for it. It is believed, and\r\nexperience has shown, that such a preparation is the best expedient that\r\ncan be resorted to prevent war. I add with much pleasure that\r\nconsiderable progress has already been made in these measures of\r\ndefense, and that they will be completed in a few years, considering the\r\ngreat extent and importance of the object, if the plan be zealously and\r\nsteadily persevered in.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Government in what relates to foreign powers is\r\nalways an object of the highest importance to the nation. Its\r\nagriculture, commerce, manufactures, fisheries, revenue, in short, its\r\npeace, may all be affected by it. Attention is therefore due to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAt the period adverted to the powers of Europe, after having been\r\nengaged in long and destructive wars with each other, had concluded a\r\npeace, which happily still exists. Our peace with the power with whom we\r\nhad been engaged had also been concluded. The war between Spain and the\r\ncolonies in South America, which had commenced many years before, was\r\nthen the only conflict that remained unsettled. This being a contest\r\nbetween different parts of the same community, in which other powers had\r\nnot interfered, was not affected by their accommodations.\r\n\r\nThis contest was considered at an early stage by my predecessor a civil\r\nwar in which the parties were entitled to equal rights in our ports.\r\nThis decision, the first made by any power, being formed on great\r\nconsideration of the comparative strength and resources of the parties,\r\nthe length of time, and successful opposition made by the colonies, and\r\nof all other circumstances on which it ought to depend, was in strict\r\naccord with the law of nations. Congress has invariably acted on this\r\nprinciple, having made no change in our relations with either party. Our\r\nattitude has therefore been that of neutrality between them, which has\r\nbeen maintained by the Government with the strictest impartiality. No\r\naid has been afforded to either, nor has any privilege been enjoyed by\r\nthe one which has not been equally open to the other party, and every\r\nexertion has been made in its power to enforce the execution of the laws\r\nprohibiting illegal equipments with equal rigor against both.\r\n\r\nBy this equality between the parties their public vessels have been\r\nreceived in our ports on the same footing; they have enjoyed an equal\r\nright to purchase and export arms, munitions of war, and every other\r\nsupply, the exportation of all articles whatever being permitted under\r\nlaws which were passed long before the commencement of the contest; our\r\ncitizens have traded equally with both, and their commerce with each has\r\nbeen alike protected by the Government.\r\n\r\nRespecting the attitude which it may be proper for the United States to\r\nmaintain hereafter between the parties, I have no hesitation in stating\r\nit as my opinion that the neutrality heretofore observed should still be\r\nadhered to. From the change in the Government of Spain and the\r\nnegotiation now depending, invited by the Cortes and accepted by the\r\ncolonies, it may be presumed, that their differences will be settled on\r\nthe terms proposed by the colonies. Should the war be continued, the\r\nUnited States, regarding its occurrences, will always have it in their\r\npower to adopt such measures respecting it as their honor and interest\r\nmay require.\r\n\r\nShortly after the general peace a band of adventurers took advantage of\r\nthis conflict and of the facility which it afforded to establish a\r\nsystem of buccaneering in the neighboring seas, to the great annoyance\r\nof the commerce of the United States, and, as was represented, of that\r\nof other powers. Of this spirit and of its injurious bearing on the\r\nUnited States strong proofs were afforded by the establishment at Amelia\r\nIsland, and the purposes to which it was made instrumental by this band\r\nin 1817, and by the occurrences which took place in other parts of\r\nFlorida in 1818, the details of which in both instances are too well\r\nknown to require to be now recited. I am satisfied had a less decisive\r\ncourse been adopted that the worst consequences would have resulted from\r\nit. We have seen that these checks, decisive as they were, were not\r\nsufficient to crush that piratical spirit. Many culprits brought within\r\nour limits have been condemned to suffer death, the punishment due to\r\nthat atrocious crime. The decisions of upright and enlightened tribunals\r\nfall equally on all whose crimes subject them, by a fair interpretation\r\nof the law, to its censure. It belongs to the Executive not to suffer\r\nthe executions under these decisions to transcend the great purpose for\r\nwhich punishment is necessary. The full benefit of example being\r\nsecured, policy as well as humanity equally forbids that they should be\r\ncarried further. I have acted on this principle, pardoning those who\r\nappear to have been led astray by ignorance of the criminality of the\r\nacts they had committed, and suffering the law to take effect on those\r\nonly in whose favor no extenuating circumstances could be urged.\r\n\r\nGreat confidence is entertained that the late treaty with Spain, which\r\nhas been ratified by both the parties, and the ratifications whereof\r\nhave been exchanged, has placed the relations of the two countries on a\r\nbasis of permanent friendship. The provision made by it for such of our\r\ncitizens as have claims on Spain of the character described will, it is\r\npresumed, be very satisfactory to them, and the boundary which is\r\nestablished between the territories of the parties westward of the\r\nMississippi, heretofore in dispute, has, it is thought, been settled on\r\nconditions just and advantageous to both. But to the acquisition of\r\nFlorida too much importance can not be attached. It secures to the\r\nUnited States a territory important in itself, and whose importance is\r\nmuch increased by its bearing on many of the highest interests of the\r\nUnion. It opens to several of the neighboring States a free passage to\r\nthe ocean, through the Province ceded, by several rivers, having their\r\nsources high up within their limits. It secures us against all future\r\nannoyance from powerful Indian tribes. It gives us several excellent\r\nharbors in the Gulf of Mexico for ships of war of the largest size. It\r\ncovers by its position in the Gulf the Mississippi and other great\r\nwaters within our extended limits, and thereby enables the United States\r\nto afford complete protection to the vast and very valuable productions\r\nof our whole Western country, which find a market through those streams.\r\n\r\nBy a treaty with the British Government, bearing date on the 20th of\r\nOctober, 1818, the convention regulating the commerce between the United\r\nStates and Great Britain, concluded on the 3d of July, 1815, which was\r\nabout expiring, was revived and continued for the term of ten years from\r\nthe time of its expiration. By that treaty, also, the differences which\r\nhad arisen under the treaty of Ghent respecting the right claimed by the\r\nUnited States for their citizens to take and cure fish on the coast of\r\nHis Britannic Majesty's dominions in America, with other differences on\r\nimportant interests, were adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties.\r\nNo agreement has yet been entered into respecting the commerce between\r\nthe United States and the British dominions in the West Indies and on\r\nthis continent. The restraints imposed on that commerce by Great\r\nBritain, and reciprocated by the United States on a principle of\r\ndefense, continue still in force.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation with France for the regulation of the commercial\r\nrelations between the two countries, which in the course of the last\r\nsummer had been commenced at Paris, has since been transferred to this\r\ncity, and will be pursued on the part of the United States in the spirit\r\nof conciliation, and with an earnest desire that it may terminate in an\r\narrangement satisfactory to both parties.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Barbary Powers are preserved in the same state\r\nand by the same means that were employed when I came into this office.\r\nAs early as 1801 it was found necessary to send a squadron into the\r\nMediterranean for the protection of our commerce and no period has\r\nintervened, a short term excepted, when it was thought advisable to\r\nwithdraw it. The great interests which the United States have in the\r\nPacific, in commerce and in the fisheries, have also made it necessary\r\nto maintain a naval force there. In disposing of this force in both\r\ninstances the most effectual measures in our power have been taken,\r\nwithout interfering with its other duties, for the suppression of the\r\nslave trade and of piracy in the neighboring seas.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the United States in regard to their resources, the\r\nextent of their revenue, and the facility with which it is raised\r\naffords a most gratifying spectacle. The payment of nearly $67,000,000\r\nof the public debt, with the great progress made in measures of defense\r\nand in other improvements of various kinds since the late war, are\r\nconclusive proofs of this extraordinary prosperity, especially when it\r\nis recollected that these expenditures have been defrayed without a\r\nburthen on the people, the direct tax and excise having been repealed\r\nsoon after the conclusion of the late war, and the revenue applied to\r\nthese great objects having been raised in a manner not to be felt. Our\r\ngreat resources therefore remain untouched for any purpose which may\r\naffect the vital interests of the nation. For all such purposes they are\r\ninexhaustible. They are more especially to be found in the virtue,\r\npatriotism, and intelligence of our fellow-citizens, and in the devotion\r\nwith which they would yield up by any just measure of taxation all their\r\nproperty in support of the rights and honor of their country.\r\n\r\nUnder the present depression of prices, affecting all the productions of\r\nthe country and every branch of industry, proceeding from causes\r\nexplained on a former occasion, the revenue has considerably diminished,\r\nthe effect of which has been to compel Congress either to abandon these\r\ngreat measures of defense or to resort to loans or internal taxes to\r\nsupply the deficiency. On the presumption that this depression and the\r\ndeficiency in the revenue arising from it would be temporary, loans were\r\nauthorized for the demands of the last and present year. Anxious to\r\nrelieve my fellow-citizens in 1817 from every burthen which could be\r\ndispensed with and the state of the Treasury permitting it, I\r\nrecommended the repeal of the internal taxes, knowing that such relief\r\nwas then peculiarly necessary in consequence of the great exertions made\r\nin the late war. I made that recommendation under a pledge that should\r\nthe public exigencies require a recurrence to them at any time while I\r\nremained in this trust, I would with equal promptitude perform the duty\r\nwhich would then be alike incumbent on me. By the experiment now making\r\nit will be seen by the next session of Congress whether the revenue\r\nshall have been so augmented as to be adequate to all these necessary\r\npurposes. Should the deficiency still continue, and especially should it\r\nbe probable that it would be permanent, the course to be pursued appears\r\nto me to be obvious. I am satisfied that under certain circumstances\r\nloans may be resorted to with great advantage. I am equally well\r\nsatisfied, as a general rule, that the demands of the current year,\r\nespecially in time of peace, should be provided for by the revenue of\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\nI have never dreaded, nor have I ever shunned, in any situation in which\r\nI have been placed making appeals to the virtue and patriotism of my\r\nfellow-citizens, well knowing that they could never be made in vain,\r\nespecially in times of great emergency or for purposes of high national\r\nimportance. Independently of the exigency of the case, many\r\nconsiderations of great weight urge a policy having in view a provision\r\nof revenue to meet to a certain extent the demands of the nation,\r\nwithout relying altogether on the precarious resource of foreign\r\ncommerce. I am satisfied that internal duties and excises, with\r\ncorresponding imposts on foreign articles of the same kind, would,\r\nwithout imposing any serious burdens on the people, enhance the price of\r\nproduce, promote our manufactures, and augment the revenue, at the same\r\ntime that they made it more secure and permanent.\r\n\r\nThe care of the Indian tribes within our limits has long been an\r\nessential part of our system, but, unfortunately, it has not been\r\nexecuted in a manner to accomplish all the objects intended by it. We\r\nhave treated them as independent nations, without their having any\r\nsubstantial pretensions to that rank. The distinction has flattered\r\ntheir pride, retarded their improvement, and in many instances paved the\r\nway to their destruction. The progress of our settlements westward,\r\nsupported as they are by a dense population, has constantly driven them\r\nback, with almost the total sacrifice of the lands which they have been\r\ncompelled to abandon. They have claims on the magnanimity and, I may\r\nadd, on the justice of this nation which we must all feel. We should\r\nbecome their real benefactors; we should perform the office of their\r\nGreat Father, the endearing title which they emphatically give to the\r\nChief Magistrate of our Union. Their sovereignty over vast territories\r\nshould cease, in lieu of which the right of soil should be secured to\r\neach individual and his posterity in competent portions; and for the\r\nterritory thus ceded by each tribe some reasonable equivalent should be\r\ngranted, to be vested in permanent funds for the support of civil\r\ngovernment over them and for the education of their children, for their\r\ninstruction in the arts of husbandry, and to provide sustenance for them\r\nuntil they could provide it for themselves. My earnest hope is that\r\nCongress will digest some plan, founded on these principles, with such\r\nimprovements as their wisdom may suggest, and carry it into effect as\r\nsoon as it may be practicable.\r\n\r\nEurope is again unsettled and the prospect of war increasing. Should the\r\nflame light up in any quarter, how far it may extend it is impossible to\r\nforesee. It is our peculiar felicity to be altogether unconnected with\r\nthe causes which produce this menacing aspect elsewhere. With every\r\npower we are in perfect amity, and it is our interest to remain so if it\r\nbe practicable on just conditions. I see no reasonable cause to\r\napprehend variance with any power, unless it proceed from a violation of\r\nour maritime rights. In these contests, should they occur, and to\r\nwhatever extent they may be carried, we shall be neutral; but as a\r\nneutral power we have rights which it is our duty to maintain. For like\r\ninjuries it will be incumbent on us to seek redress in a spirit of\r\namity, in full confidence that, injuring none, none would knowingly\r\ninjure us. For more imminent dangers we should be prepared, and it\r\nshould always be recollected that such preparation adapted to the\r\ncircumstances and sanctioned by the judgment and wishes of our\r\nconstituents can not fail to have a good effect in averting dangers of\r\nevery kind. We should recollect also that the season of peace is best\r\nadapted to these preparations.\r\n\r\nIf we turn our attention, fellow-citizens, more immediately to the\r\ninternal concerns of our country, and more especially to those on which\r\nits future welfare depends, we have every reason to anticipate the\r\nhappiest results. It is now rather more than forty-four years since we\r\ndeclared our independence, and thirty-seven since it was acknowledged.\r\nThe talents and virtues which were displayed in that great struggle were\r\na sure presage of all that has since followed. A people who were able to\r\nsurmount in their infant state such great perils would be more competent\r\nas they rose into manhood to repel any which they might meet in their\r\nprogress. Their physical strength would be more adequate to foreign\r\ndanger, and the practice of self-government, aided by the light of\r\nexperience, could not fail to produce an effect equally salutary on all\r\nthose questions connected with the internal organization. These\r\nfavorable anticipations have been realized.\r\n\r\nIn our whole system, national and State, we have shunned all the defects\r\nwhich unceasingly preyed on the vitals and destroyed the ancient\r\nRepublics. In them there were distinct orders, a nobility and a people,\r\nor the people governed in one assembly. Thus, in the one instance there\r\nwas a perpetual conflict between the orders in society for the\r\nascendency, in which the victory of either terminated in the overthrow\r\nof the government and the ruin of the state; in the other, in which the\r\npeople governed in a body, and whose dominions seldom exceeded the\r\ndimensions of a county in one of our States, a tumultuous and disorderly\r\nmovement permitted only a transitory existence. In this great nation\r\nthere is but one order, that of the people, whose power, by a peculiarly\r\nhappy improvement of the representative principle, is transferred from\r\nthem, without impairing in the slightest degree their sovereignty, to\r\nbodies of their own creation, and to persons elected by themselves, in\r\nthe full extent necessary for all the purposes of free, enlightened and\r\nefficient government. The whole system is elective, the complete\r\nsovereignty being in the people, and every officer in every department\r\nderiving his authority from and being responsible to them for his\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nOur career has corresponded with this great outline. Perfection in our\r\norganization could not have been expected in the outset either in the\r\nNational or State Governments or in tracing the line between their\r\nrespective powers. But no serious conflict has arisen, nor any contest\r\nbut such as are managed by argument and by a fair appeal to the good\r\nsense of the people, and many of the defects which experience had\r\nclearly demonstrated in both Governments have been remedied. By steadily\r\npursuing this course in this spirit there is every reason to believe\r\nthat our system will soon attain the highest degree of perfection of\r\nwhich human institutions are capable, and that the movement in all its\r\nbranches will exhibit such a degree of order and harmony as to command\r\nthe admiration and respect of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nOur physical attainments have not been less eminent. Twenty-five years\r\nago the river Mississippi was shut up and our Western brethren had no\r\noutlet for their commerce. What has been the progress since that time?\r\nThe river has not only become the property of the United States from its\r\nsource to the ocean, with all its tributary streams (with the exception\r\nof the upper part of the Red River only), but Louisiana, with a fair and\r\nliberal boundary on the western side and the Floridas on the eastern,\r\nhave been ceded to us. The United States now enjoy the complete and\r\nuninterrupted sovereignty over the whole territory from St. Croix to the\r\nSabine. New States, settled from among ourselves in this and in other\r\nparts, have been admitted into our Union in equal participation in the\r\nnational sovereignty with the original States. Our population has\r\naugmented in an astonishing degree and extended in every direction. We\r\nnow, fellow-citizens, comprise within our limits the dimensions and\r\nfaculties of a great power under a Government possessing all the\r\nenergies of any government ever known to the Old World, with an utter\r\nincapacity to oppress the people.\r\n\r\nEntering with these views the office which I have just solemnly sworn to\r\nexecute with fidelity and to the utmost of my ability, I derive great\r\nsatisfaction from a knowledge that I shall be assisted in the several\r\nDepartments by the very enlightened and upright citizens from whom I\r\nhave received so much aid in the preceding term. With full confidence in\r\nthe continuance of that candor and generous indulgence from my\r\nfellow-citizens at large which I have heretofore experienced, and with\r\na firm reliance on the protection of Almighty God, I shall forthwith\r\ncommence the duties of the high trust to which you have called me.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN QUINCY ADAMS, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, MARCH 4, 1825\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The only son of a former President to be elected\r\nto the Nation's highest office, John Quincy Adams was chosen by the\r\nHouse of Representatives when the electoral college could not determine\r\na clear winner of the 1824 election. The outcome was assured when Henry\r\nClay, one of the front-runners, threw his support to Mr. Adams so that\r\nAndrew Jackson's candidacy would fail. General Jackson had polled more\r\npopular votes in the election, but he did not gain enough electoral\r\nvotes to win outright. The oath of office was administered by Chief\r\nJustice John Marshall inside the Hall of the House of Representatives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn compliance with an usage coeval with the existence of our Federal\r\nConstitution, and sanctioned by the example of my predecessors in the\r\ncareer upon which I am about to enter, I appear, my fellow-citizens, in\r\nyour presence and in that of Heaven to bind myself by the solemnities of\r\nreligious obligation to the faithful performance of the duties allotted\r\nto me in the station to which I have been called.\r\n\r\nIn unfolding to my countrymen the principles by which I shall be\r\ngoverned in the fulfillment of those duties my first resort will be to\r\nthat Constitution which I shall swear to the best of my ability to\r\npreserve, protect, and defend. That revered instrument enumerates the\r\npowers and prescribes the duties of the Executive Magistrate, and in its\r\nfirst words declares the purposes to which these and the whole action of\r\nthe Government instituted by it should be invariably and sacredly\r\ndevoted--to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure\r\ndomestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the\r\ngeneral welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of\r\nthis Union in their successive generations. Since the adoption of this\r\nsocial compact one of these generations has passed away. It is the work\r\nof our forefathers. Administered by some of the most eminent men who\r\ncontributed to its formation, through a most eventful period in the\r\nannals of the world, and through all the vicissitudes of peace and war\r\nincidental to the condition of associated man, it has not disappointed\r\nthe hopes and aspirations of those illustrious benefactors of their age\r\nand nation. It has promoted the lasting welfare of that country so dear\r\nto us all; it has to an extent far beyond the ordinary lot of humanity\r\nsecured the freedom and happiness of this people. We now receive it as a\r\nprecious inheritance from those to whom we are indebted for its\r\nestablishment, doubly bound by the examples which they have left us and\r\nby the blessings which we have enjoyed as the fruits of their labors to\r\ntransmit the same unimpaired to the succeeding generation.\r\n\r\nIn the compass of thirty-six years since this great national covenant\r\nwas instituted a body of laws enacted under its authority and in\r\nconformity with its provisions has unfolded its powers and carried into\r\npractical operation its effective energies. Subordinate departments have\r\ndistributed the executive functions in their various relations to\r\nforeign affairs, to the revenue and expenditures, and to the military\r\nforce of the Union by land and sea. A coordinate department of the\r\njudiciary has expounded the Constitution and the laws, settling in\r\nharmonious coincidence with the legislative will numerous weighty\r\nquestions of construction which the imperfection of human language had\r\nrendered unavoidable. The year of jubilee since the first formation of\r\nour Union has just elapsed; that of the declaration of our independence\r\nis at hand. The consummation of both was effected by this Constitution.\r\n\r\nSince that period a population of four millions has multiplied to\r\ntwelve. A territory bounded by the Mississippi has been extended from\r\nsea to sea. New States have been admitted to the Union in numbers nearly\r\nequal to those of the first Confederation. Treaties of peace, amity, and\r\ncommerce have been concluded with the principal dominions of the earth.\r\nThe people of other nations, inhabitants of regions acquired not by\r\nconquest, but by compact, have been united with us in the participation\r\nof our rights and duties, of our burdens and blessings. The forest has\r\nfallen by the ax of our woodsmen; the soil has been made to teem by the\r\ntillage of our farmers; our commerce has whitened every ocean. The\r\ndominion of man over physical nature has been extended by the invention\r\nof our artists. Liberty and law have marched hand in hand. All the\r\npurposes of human association have been accomplished as effectively as\r\nunder any other government on the globe, and at a cost little exceeding\r\nin a whole generation the expenditure of other nations in a single year.\r\n\r\nSuch is the unexaggerated picture of our condition under a Constitution\r\nfounded upon the republican principle of equal rights. To admit that\r\nthis picture has its shades is but to say that it is still the condition\r\nof men upon earth. From evil--physical, moral, and political--it is not\r\nour claim to be exempt. We have suffered sometimes by the visitation of\r\nHeaven through disease; often by the wrongs and injustice of other\r\nnations, even to the extremities of war; and, lastly, by dissensions\r\namong ourselves--dissensions perhaps inseparable from the enjoyment of\r\nfreedom, but which have more than once appeared to threaten the\r\ndissolution of the Union, and with it the overthrow of all the\r\nenjoyments of our present lot and all our earthly hopes of the future.\r\nThe causes of these dissensions have been various, founded upon\r\ndifferences of speculation in the theory of republican government; upon\r\nconflicting views of policy in our relations with foreign nations; upon\r\njealousies of partial and sectional interests, aggravated by prejudices\r\nand prepossessions which strangers to each other are ever apt to\r\nentertain.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of gratification and of encouragement to me to observe\r\nthat the great result of this experiment upon the theory of human rights\r\nhas at the close of that generation by which it was formed been crowned\r\nwith success equal to the most sanguine expectations of its founders.\r\nUnion, justice, tranquillity, the common defense, the general welfare,\r\nand the blessings of liberty--all have been promoted by the Government\r\nunder which we have lived. Standing at this point of time, looking back\r\nto that generation which has gone by and forward to that which is\r\nadvancing, we may at once indulge in grateful exultation and in cheering\r\nhope. From the experience of the past we derive instructive lessons for\r\nthe future. Of the two great political parties which have divided the\r\nopinions and feelings of our country, the candid and the just will now\r\nadmit that both have contributed splendid talents, spotless integrity,\r\nardent patriotism, and disinterested sacrifices to the formation and\r\nadministration of this Government, and that both have required a liberal\r\nindulgence for a portion of human infirmity and error. The revolutionary\r\nwars of Europe, commencing precisely at the moment when the Government\r\nof the United States first went into operation under this Constitution,\r\nexcited a collision of sentiments and of sympathies which kindled all\r\nthe passions and imbittered the conflict of parties till the nation was\r\ninvolved in war and the Union was shaken to its center. This time of\r\ntrial embraced a period of five and twenty years, during which the\r\npolicy of the Union in its relations with Europe constituted the\r\nprincipal basis of our political divisions and the most arduous part of\r\nthe action of our Federal Government. With the catastrophe in which the\r\nwars of the French Revolution terminated, and our own subsequent peace\r\nwith Great Britain, this baneful weed of party strife was uprooted. From\r\nthat time no difference of principle, connected either with the theory\r\nof government or with our intercourse with foreign nations, has existed\r\nor been called forth in force sufficient to sustain a continued\r\ncombination of parties or to give more than wholesome animation to\r\npublic sentiment or legislative debate. Our political creed is, without\r\na dissenting voice that can be heard, that the will of the people is the\r\nsource and the happiness of the people the end of all legitimate\r\ngovernment upon earth; that the best security for the beneficence and\r\nthe best guaranty against the abuse of power consists in the freedom,\r\nthe purity, and the frequency of popular elections; that the General\r\nGovernment of the Union and the separate governments of the States are\r\nall sovereignties of limited powers, fellow-servants of the same\r\nmasters, uncontrolled within their respective spheres, uncontrollable by\r\nencroachments upon each other; that the firmest security of peace is the\r\npreparation during peace of the defenses of war; that a rigorous economy\r\nand accountability of public expenditures should guard against the\r\naggravation and alleviate when possible the burden of taxation; that the\r\nmilitary should be kept in strict subordination to the civil power; that\r\nthe freedom of the press and of religious opinion should be inviolate;\r\nthat the policy of our country is peace and the ark of our salvation\r\nunion are articles of faith upon which we are all now agreed. If there\r\nhave been those who doubted whether a confederated representative\r\ndemocracy were a government competent to the wise and orderly management\r\nof the common concerns of a mighty nation, those doubts have been\r\ndispelled; if there have been projects of partial confederacies to be\r\nerected upon the ruins of the Union, they have been scattered to the\r\nwinds; if there have been dangerous attachments to one foreign nation\r\nand antipathies against another, they have been extinguished. Ten years\r\nof peace, at home and abroad, have assuaged the animosities of political\r\ncontention and blended into harmony the most discordant elements of\r\npublic opinion. There still remains one effort of magnanimity, one\r\nsacrifice of prejudice and passion, to be made by the individuals\r\nthroughout the nation who have heretofore followed the standards of\r\npolitical party. It is that of discarding every remnant of rancor\r\nagainst each other, of embracing as countrymen and friends, and of\r\nyielding to talents and virtue alone that confidence which in times of\r\ncontention for principle was bestowed only upon those who bore the badge\r\nof party communion.\r\n\r\nThe collisions of party spirit which originate in speculative opinions\r\nor in different views of administrative policy are in their nature\r\ntransitory. Those which are founded on geographical divisions, adverse\r\ninterests of soil, climate, and modes of domestic life are more\r\npermanent, and therefore, perhaps, more dangerous. It is this which\r\ngives inestimable value to the character of our Government, at once\r\nfederal and national. It holds out to us a perpetual admonition to\r\npreserve alike and with equal anxiety the rights of each individual\r\nState in its own government and the rights of the whole nation in that\r\nof the Union. Whatsoever is of domestic concernment, unconnected with\r\nthe other members of the Union or with foreign lands, belongs\r\nexclusively to the administration of the State governments. Whatsoever\r\ndirectly involves the rights and interests of the federative fraternity\r\nor of foreign powers is of the resort of this General Government. The\r\nduties of both are obvious in the general principle, though sometimes\r\nperplexed with difficulties in the detail. To respect the rights of the\r\nState governments is the inviolable duty of that of the Union; the\r\ngovernment of every State will feel its own obligation to respect and\r\npreserve the rights of the whole. The prejudices everywhere too commonly\r\nentertained against distant strangers are worn away, and the jealousies\r\nof jarring interests are allayed by the composition and functions of the\r\ngreat national councils annually assembled from all quarters of the\r\nUnion at this place. Here the distinguished men from every section of\r\nour country, while meeting to deliberate upon the great interests of\r\nthose by whom they are deputed, learn to estimate the talents and do\r\njustice to the virtues of each other. The harmony of the nation is\r\npromoted and the whole Union is knit together by the sentiments of\r\nmutual respect, the habits of social intercourse, and the ties of\r\npersonal friendship formed between the representatives of its several\r\nparts in the performance of their service at this metropolis.\r\n\r\nPassing from this general review of the purposes and injunctions of the\r\nFederal Constitution and their results as indicating the first traces of\r\nthe path of duty in the discharge of my public trust, I turn to the\r\nAdministration of my immediate predecessor as the second. It has passed\r\naway in a period of profound peace, how much to the satisfaction of our\r\ncountry and to the honor of our country's name is known to you all. The\r\ngreat features of its policy, in general concurrence with the will of\r\nthe Legislature, have been to cherish peace while preparing for\r\ndefensive war; to yield exact justice to other nations and maintain the\r\nrights of our own; to cherish the principles of freedom and of equal\r\nrights wherever they were proclaimed; to discharge with all possible\r\npromptitude the national debt; to reduce within the narrowest limits of\r\nefficiency the military force; to improve the organization and\r\ndiscipline of the Army; to provide and sustain a school of military\r\nscience; to extend equal protection to all the great interests of the\r\nnation; to promote the civilization of the Indian tribes, and to proceed\r\nin the great system of internal improvements within the limits of the\r\nconstitutional power of the Union. Under the pledge of these promises,\r\nmade by that eminent citizen at the time of his first induction to this\r\noffice, in his career of eight years the internal taxes have been\r\nrepealed; sixty millions of the public debt have been discharged;\r\nprovision has been made for the comfort and relief of the aged and\r\nindigent among the surviving warriors of the Revolution; the regular\r\narmed force has been reduced and its constitution revised and perfected;\r\nthe accountability for the expenditure of public moneys has been made\r\nmore effective; the Floridas have been peaceably acquired, and our\r\nboundary has been extended to the Pacific Ocean; the independence of the\r\nsouthern nations of this hemisphere has been recognized, and recommended\r\nby example and by counsel to the potentates of Europe; progress has been\r\nmade in the defense of the country by fortifications and the increase of\r\nthe Navy, toward the effectual suppression of the African traffic in\r\nslaves; in alluring the aboriginal hunters of our land to the\r\ncultivation of the soil and of the mind, in exploring the interior\r\nregions of the Union, and in preparing by scientific researches and\r\nsurveys for the further application of our national resources to the\r\ninternal improvement of our country.\r\n\r\nIn this brief outline of the promise and performance of my immediate\r\npredecessor the line of duty for his successor is clearly delineated. To\r\npursue to their consummation those purposes of improvement in our common\r\ncondition instituted or recommended by him will embrace the whole sphere\r\nof my obligations. To the topic of internal improvement, emphatically\r\nurged by him at his inauguration, I recur with peculiar satisfaction. It\r\nis that from which I am convinced that the unborn millions of our\r\nposterity who are in future ages to people this continent will derive\r\ntheir most fervent gratitude to the founders of the Union; that in which\r\nthe beneficent action of its Government will be most deeply felt and\r\nacknowledged. The magnificence and splendor of their public works are\r\namong the imperishable glories of the ancient republics. The roads and\r\naqueducts of Rome have been the admiration of all after ages, and have\r\nsurvived thousands of years after all her conquests have been swallowed\r\nup in despotism or become the spoil of barbarians. Some diversity of\r\nopinion has prevailed with regard to the powers of Congress for\r\nlegislation upon objects of this nature. The most respectful deference\r\nis due to doubts originating in pure patriotism and sustained by\r\nvenerated authority. But nearly twenty years have passed since the\r\nconstruction of the first national road was commenced. The authority for\r\nits construction was then unquestioned. To how many thousands of our\r\ncountrymen has it proved a benefit? To what single individual has it\r\never proved an injury? Repeated, liberal, and candid discussions in the\r\nLegislature have conciliated the sentiments and approximated the\r\nopinions of enlightened minds upon the question of constitutional power.\r\nI can not but hope that by the same process of friendly, patient, and\r\npersevering deliberation all constitutional objections will ultimately\r\nbe removed. The extent and limitation of the powers of the General\r\nGovernment in relation to this transcendently important interest will be\r\nsettled and acknowledged to the common satisfaction of all, and every\r\nspeculative scruple will be solved by a practical public blessing.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, you are acquainted with the peculiar circumstances of\r\nthe recent election, which have resulted in affording me the opportunity\r\nof addressing you at this time. You have heard the exposition of the\r\nprinciples which will direct me in the fulfillment of the high and\r\nsolemn trust imposed upon me in this station. Less possessed of your\r\nconfidence in advance than any of my predecessors, I am deeply conscious\r\nof the prospect that I shall stand more and oftener in need of your\r\nindulgence. Intentions upright and pure, a heart devoted to the welfare\r\nof our country, and the unceasing application of all the faculties\r\nallotted to me to her service are all the pledges that I can give for\r\nthe faithful performance of the arduous duties I am to undertake. To the\r\nguidance of the legislative councils, to the assistance of the executive\r\nand subordinate departments, to the friendly cooperation of the\r\nrespective State governments, to the candid and liberal support of the\r\npeople so far as it may be deserved by honest industry and zeal, I shall\r\nlook for whatever success may attend my public service; and knowing that\r\n\"except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain,\" with\r\nfervent supplications for His favor, to His overruling providence I\r\ncommit with humble but fearless confidence my own fate and the future\r\ndestinies of my country.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1829\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The election of Andrew Jackson was heralded as a\r\nnew page in the history of the Republic. The first military leader\r\nelected President since George Washington, he was much admired by the\r\nelectorate, who came to Washington to celebrate \"Old Hickory's\"\r\ninauguration. Outgoing President Adams did not join in the ceremony,\r\nwhich was held for the first time on the East Portico of the Capitol\r\nbuilding. Chief Justice John Marshall administered the oath of office.\r\nAfter the proceedings at the Capitol, a large group of citizens walked\r\nwith the new President along Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, and\r\nmany of them visited the executive mansion that day and evening. Such\r\nlarge numbers of people arrived that many of the furnishings were\r\nruined. President Jackson left the building by a window to avoid the\r\ncrush of people.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nAbout to undertake the arduous duties that I have been appointed to\r\nperform by the choice of a free people, I avail myself of this customary\r\nand solemn occasion to express the gratitude which their confidence\r\ninspires and to acknowledge the accountability which my situation\r\nenjoins. While the magnitude of their interests convinces me that no\r\nthanks can be adequate to the honor they have conferred, it admonishes\r\nme that the best return I can make is the zealous dedication of my\r\nhumble abilities to their service and their good.\r\n\r\nAs the instrument of the Federal Constitution it will devolve on me for\r\na stated period to execute the laws of the United States, to superintend\r\ntheir foreign and their confederate relations, to manage their revenue,\r\nto command their forces, and, by communications to the Legislature, to\r\nwatch over and to promote their interests generally. And the principles\r\nof action by which I shall endeavor to accomplish this circle of duties\r\nit is now proper for me briefly to explain.\r\n\r\nIn administering the laws of Congress I shall keep steadily in view the\r\nlimitations as well as the extent of the Executive power trusting\r\nthereby to discharge the functions of my office without transcending its\r\nauthority. With foreign nations it will be my study to preserve peace\r\nand to cultivate friendship on fair and honorable terms, and in the\r\nadjustment of any differences that may exist or arise to exhibit the\r\nforbearance becoming a powerful nation rather than the sensibility\r\nbelonging to a gallant people.\r\n\r\nIn such measures as I may be called on to pursue in regard to the rights\r\nof the separate States I hope to be animated by a proper respect for\r\nthose sovereign members of our Union, taking care not to confound the\r\npowers they have reserved to themselves with those they have granted to\r\nthe Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThe management of the public revenue--that searching operation in all\r\ngovernments--is among the most delicate and important trusts in ours,\r\nand it will, of course, demand no inconsiderable share of my official\r\nsolicitude. Under every aspect in which it can be considered it would\r\nappear that advantage must result from the observance of a strict and\r\nfaithful economy. This I shall aim at the more anxiously both because it\r\nwill facilitate the extinguishment of the national debt, the unnecessary\r\nduration of which is incompatible with real independence, and because it\r\nwill counteract that tendency to public and private profligacy which a\r\nprofuse expenditure of money by the Government is but too apt to\r\nengender. Powerful auxiliaries to the attainment of this desirable end\r\nare to be found in the regulations provided by the wisdom of Congress\r\nfor the specific appropriation of public money and the prompt\r\naccountability of public officers.\r\n\r\nWith regard to a proper selection of the subjects of impost with a view\r\nto revenue, it would seem to me that the spirit of equity, caution and\r\ncompromise in which the Constitution was formed requires that the great\r\ninterests of agriculture, commerce, and manufactures should be equally\r\nfavored, and that perhaps the only exception to this rule should consist\r\nin the peculiar encouragement of any products of either of them that may\r\nbe found essential to our national independence.\r\n\r\nInternal improvement and the diffusion of knowledge, so far as they can\r\nbe promoted by the constitutional acts of the Federal Government, are of\r\nhigh importance.\r\n\r\nConsidering standing armies as dangerous to free governments in time of\r\npeace, I shall not seek to enlarge our present establishment, nor\r\ndisregard that salutary lesson of political experience which teaches\r\nthat the military should be held subordinate to the civil power. The\r\ngradual increase of our Navy, whose flag has displayed in distant climes\r\nour skill in navigation and our fame in arms; the preservation of our\r\nforts, arsenals, and dockyards, and the introduction of progressive\r\nimprovements in the discipline and science of both branches of our\r\nmilitary service are so plainly prescribed by prudence that I should be\r\nexcused for omitting their mention sooner than for enlarging on their\r\nimportance. But the bulwark of our defense is the national militia,\r\nwhich in the present state of our intelligence and population must\r\nrender us invincible. As long as our Government is administered for the\r\ngood of the people, and is regulated by their will; as long as it\r\nsecures to us the rights of person and of property, liberty of\r\nconscience and of the press, it will be worth defending; and so long as\r\nit is worth defending a patriotic militia will cover it with an\r\nimpenetrable aegis. Partial injuries and occasional mortifications we\r\nmay be subjected to, but a million of armed freemen, possessed of the\r\nmeans of war, can never be conquered by a foreign foe. To any just\r\nsystem, therefore, calculated to strengthen this natural safeguard of\r\nthe country I shall cheerfully lend all the aid in my power.\r\n\r\nIt will be my sincere and constant desire to observe toward the Indian\r\ntribes within our limits a just and liberal policy, and to give that\r\nhumane and considerate attention to their rights and their wants which\r\nis consistent with the habits of our Government and the feelings of our\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribes on the list of\r\nExecutive duties, in characters too legible to be overlooked, the task\r\nof reform, which will require particularly the correction of those\r\nabuses that have brought the patronage of the Federal Government into\r\nconflict with the freedom of elections, and the counteraction of those\r\ncauses which have disturbed the rightful course of appointment and have\r\nplaced or continued power in unfaithful or incompetent hands.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of a task thus generally delineated I shall endeavor\r\nto select men whose diligence and talents will insure in their\r\nrespective stations able and faithful cooperation, depending for the\r\nadvancement of the public service more on the integrity and zeal of the\r\npublic officers than on their numbers.\r\n\r\nA diffidence, perhaps too just, in my own qualifications will teach me\r\nto look with reverence to the examples of public virtue left by my\r\nillustrious predecessors, and with veneration to the lights that flow\r\nfrom the mind that founded and the mind that reformed our system. The\r\nsame diffidence induces me to hope for instruction and aid from the\r\ncoordinate branches of the Government, and for the indulgence and\r\nsupport of my fellow-citizens generally. And a firm reliance on the\r\ngoodness of that Power whose providence mercifully protected our\r\nnational infancy, and has since upheld our liberties in various\r\nvicissitudes, encourages me to offer up my ardent supplications that He\r\nwill continue to make our beloved country the object of His divine care\r\nand gracious benediction.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDREW JACKSON, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MARCH 4, 1833\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  Cold weather and the President's poor health\r\ncaused the second inauguration to be much quieter than the first. The\r\nPresident's speech was delivered to a large assembly inside the Hall of\r\nthe House of Representatives. Chief Justice John Marshall administered\r\nthe oath of office for the ninth, and last, time.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nThe will of the American people, expressed through their unsolicited\r\nsuffrages, calls me before you to pass through the solemnities\r\npreparatory to taking upon myself the duties of President of the United\r\nStates for another term. For their approbation of my public conduct\r\nthrough a period which has not been without its difficulties, and for\r\nthis renewed expression of their confidence in my good intentions, I am\r\nat a loss for terms adequate to the expression of my gratitude. It shall\r\nbe displayed to the extent of my humble abilities in continued efforts\r\nso to administer the Government as to preserve their liberty and promote\r\ntheir happiness.\r\n\r\nSo many events have occurred within the last four years which have\r\nnecessarily called forth--sometimes under circumstances the most\r\ndelicate and painful--my views of the principles and policy which ought\r\nto be pursued by the General Government that I need on this occasion but\r\nallude to a few leading considerations connected with some of them.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy adopted by our Government soon after the formation of\r\nour present Constitution, and very generally pursued by successive\r\nAdministrations, has been crowned with almost complete success, and has\r\nelevated our character among the nations of the earth. To do justice to\r\nall and to submit to wrong from none has been during my Administration\r\nits governing maxim, and so happy have been its results that we are not\r\nonly at peace with all the world, but have few causes of controversy,\r\nand those of minor importance, remaining unadjusted.\r\n\r\nIn the domestic policy of this Government there are two objects which\r\nespecially deserve the attention of the people and their\r\nrepresentatives, and which have been and will continue to be the\r\nsubjects of my increasing solicitude. They are the preservation of the\r\nrights of the several States and the integrity of the Union.\r\n\r\nThese great objects are necessarily connected, and can only be attained\r\nby an enlightened exercise of the powers of each within its appropriate\r\nsphere in conformity with the public will constitutionally expressed. To\r\nthis end it becomes the duty of all to yield a ready and patriotic\r\nsubmission to the laws constitutionally enacted and thereby promote and\r\nstrengthen a proper confidence in those institutions of the several\r\nStates and of the United States which the people themselves have\r\nordained for their own government.\r\n\r\nMy experience in public concerns and the observation of a life somewhat\r\nadvanced confirm the opinions long since imbibed by me, that the\r\ndestruction of our State governments or the annihilation of their\r\ncontrol over the local concerns of the people would lead directly to\r\nrevolution and anarchy, and finally to despotism and military\r\ndomination. In proportion, therefore, as the General Government\r\nencroaches upon the rights of the States, in the same proportion does it\r\nimpair its own power and detract from its ability to fulfill the\r\npurposes of its creation. Solemnly impressed with these considerations,\r\nmy countrymen will ever find me ready to exercise my constitutional\r\npowers in arresting measures which may directly or indirectly encroach\r\nupon the rights of the States or tend to consolidate all political power\r\nin the General Government. But of equal, and, indeed, of incalculable,\r\nimportance is the union of these States, and the sacred duty of all to\r\ncontribute to its preservation by a liberal support of the General\r\nGovernment in the exercise of its just powers. You have been wisely\r\nadmonished to \"accustom yourselves to think and speak of the Union as of\r\nthe palladium of your political safety and prosperity, watching for its\r\npreservation with Jealous anxiety, discountenancing whatever may suggest\r\neven a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly\r\nfrowning upon the first dawning of any attempt to alienate any portion\r\nof our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now\r\nlink together the various parts.\" Without union our independence and\r\nliberty would never have been achieved; without union they never can be\r\nmaintained. Divided into twenty-four, or even a smaller number, of\r\nseparate communities, we shall see our internal trade burdened with\r\nnumberless restraints and exactions; communication between distant\r\npoints and sections obstructed or cut off; our sons made soldiers to\r\ndeluge with blood the fields they now till in peace; the mass of our\r\npeople borne down and impoverished by taxes to support armies and\r\nnavies, and military leaders at the head of their victorious legions\r\nbecoming our lawgivers and judges. The loss of liberty, of all good\r\ngovernment, of peace, plenty, and happiness, must inevitably follow a\r\ndissolution of the Union. In supporting it, therefore, we support all\r\nthat is dear to the freeman and the philanthropist.\r\n\r\nThe time at which I stand before you is full of interest. The eyes of\r\nall nations are fixed on our Republic. The event of the existing crisis\r\nwill be decisive in the opinion of mankind of the practicability of our\r\nfederal system of government. Great is the stake placed in our hands;\r\ngreat is the responsibility which must rest upon the people of the\r\nUnited States. Let us realize the importance of the attitude in which we\r\nstand before the world. Let us exercise forbearance and firmness. Let us\r\nextricate our country from the dangers which surround it and learn\r\nwisdom from the lessons they inculcate.\r\n\r\nDeeply impressed with the truth of these observations, and under the\r\nobligation of that solemn oath which I am about to take, I shall\r\ncontinue to exert all my faculties to maintain the just powers of the\r\nConstitution and to transmit unimpaired to posterity the blessings of\r\nour Federal Union. At the same time, it will be my aim to inculcate by\r\nmy official acts the necessity of exercising by the General Government\r\nthose powers only that are clearly delegated; to encourage simplicity\r\nand economy in the expenditures of the Government; to raise no more\r\nmoney from the people than may be requisite for these objects, and in a\r\nmanner that will best promote the interests of all classes of the\r\ncommunity and of all portions of the Union. Constantly bearing in mind\r\nthat in entering into society \"individuals must give up a share of\r\nliberty to preserve the rest,\" it will be my desire so to discharge my\r\nduties as to foster with our brethren in all parts of the country a\r\nspirit of liberal concession and compromise, and, by reconciling our\r\nfellow-citizens to those partial sacrifices which they must unavoidably\r\nmake for the preservation of a greater good, to recommend our invaluable\r\nGovernment and Union to the confidence and affections of the American\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is my most fervent prayer to that Almighty Being before whom\r\nI now stand, and who has kept us in His hands from the infancy of our\r\nRepublic to the present day, that He will so overrule all my intentions\r\nand actions and inspire the hearts of my fellow-citizens that we may be\r\npreserved from dangers of all kinds and continue forever a united and\r\nhappy people.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTIN VAN BUREN, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1837\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The ailing President Jackson and his Vice\r\nPresident Van Buren rode together to the Capitol from the White House in\r\na carriage made of timbers from the U.S.S. Constitution. Chief Justice\r\nRoger Taney administered the oath of office on the East Portico of the\r\nCapitol. For the first and only time, the election for Vice President\r\nhad been decided by the Senate, as provided by the Constitution, when\r\nthe electoral college could not select a winner. The new Vice President,\r\nRichard M. Johnson, took his oath in the Senate Chamber.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nThe practice of all my predecessors imposes on me an obligation I\r\ncheerfully fulfill--to accompany the first and solemn act of my public\r\ntrust with an avowal of the principles that will guide me in performing\r\nit and an expression of my feelings on assuming a charge so responsible\r\nand vast. In imitating their example I tread in the footsteps of\r\nillustrious men, whose superiors it is our happiness to believe are not\r\nfound on the executive calendar of any country. Among them we recognize\r\nthe earliest and firmest pillars of the Republic--those by whom our\r\nnational independence was first declared, him who above all others\r\ncontributed to establish it on the field of battle, and those whose\r\nexpanded intellect and patriotism constructed, improved, and perfected\r\nthe inestimable institutions under which we live. If such men in the\r\nposition I now occupy felt themselves overwhelmed by a sense of\r\ngratitude for this the highest of all marks of their country's\r\nconfidence, and by a consciousness of their inability adequately to\r\ndischarge the duties of an office so difficult and exalted, how much\r\nmore must these considerations affect one who can rely on no such claims\r\nfor favor or forbearance! Unlike all who have preceded me, the\r\nRevolution that gave us existence as one people was achieved at the\r\nperiod of my birth; and whilst I contemplate with grateful reverence\r\nthat memorable event, I feel that I belong to a later age and that I may\r\nnot expect my countrymen to weigh my actions with the same kind and\r\npartial hand.\r\n\r\nSo sensibly, fellow-citizens, do these circumstances press themselves\r\nupon me that I should not dare to enter upon my path of duty did I not\r\nlook for the generous aid of those who will be associated with me in the\r\nvarious and coordinate branches of the Government; did I not repose with\r\nunwavering reliance on the patriotism, the intelligence, and the\r\nkindness of a people who never yet deserted a public servant honestly\r\nlaboring their cause; and, above all, did I not permit myself humbly to\r\nhope for the sustaining support of an ever-watchful and beneficent\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\nTo the confidence and consolation derived from these sources it would be\r\nungrateful not to add those which spring from our present fortunate\r\ncondition. Though not altogether exempt from embarrassments that disturb\r\nour tranquillity at home and threaten it abroad, yet in all the\r\nattributes of a great, happy, and flourishing people we stand without a\r\nparallel in the world. Abroad we enjoy the respect and, with scarcely an\r\nexception, the friendship of every nation; at home, while our Government\r\nquietly but efficiently performs the sole legitimate end of political\r\ninstitutions--in doing the greatest good to the greatest number--we\r\npresent an aggregate of human prosperity surely not elsewhere to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nHow imperious, then, is the obligation imposed upon every citizen, in\r\nhis own sphere of action, whether limited or extended, to exert himself\r\nin perpetuating a condition of things so singularly happy! All the\r\nlessons of history and experience must be lost upon us if we are content\r\nto trust alone to the peculiar advantages we happen to possess. Position\r\nand climate and the bounteous resources that nature has scattered with\r\nso liberal a hand--even the diffused intelligence and elevated character\r\nof our people--will avail us nothing if we fail sacredly to uphold those\r\npolitical institutions that were wisely and deliberately formed with\r\nreference to every circumstance that could preserve or might endanger\r\nthe blessings we enjoy. The thoughtful framers of our Constitution\r\nlegislated for our country as they found it. Looking upon it with the\r\neyes of statesmen and patriots, they saw all the sources of rapid and\r\nwonderful prosperity; but they saw also that various habits, opinions\r\nand institutions peculiar to the various portions of so vast a region\r\nwere deeply fixed. Distinct sovereignties were in actual existence,\r\nwhose cordial union was essential to the welfare and happiness of all.\r\nBetween many of them there was, at least to some extent, a real\r\ndiversity of interests, liable to be exaggerated through sinister\r\ndesigns; they differed in size, in population, in wealth, and in actual\r\nand prospective resources and power; they varied in the character of\r\ntheir industry and staple productions, and [in some] existed domestic\r\ninstitutions which, unwisely disturbed, might endanger the harmony of\r\nthe whole. Most carefully were all these circumstances weighed, and the\r\nfoundations of the new Government laid upon principles of reciprocal\r\nconcession and equitable compromise. The jealousies which the smaller\r\nStates might entertain of the power of the rest were allayed by a rule\r\nof representation confessedly unequal at the time, and designed forever\r\nto remain so. A natural fear that the broad scope of general legislation\r\nmight bear upon and unwisely control particular interests was\r\ncounteracted by limits strictly drawn around the action of the Federal\r\nauthority, and to the people and the States was left unimpaired their\r\nsovereign power over the innumerable subjects embraced in the internal\r\ngovernment of a just republic, excepting such only as necessarily\r\nappertain to the concerns of the whole confederacy or its intercourse as\r\na united community with the other nations of the world.\r\n\r\nThis provident forecast has been verified by time. Half a century,\r\nteeming with extraordinary events, and elsewhere producing astonishing\r\nresults, has passed along, but on our institutions it has left no\r\ninjurious mark. From a small community we have risen to a people\r\npowerful in numbers and in strength; but with our increase has gone hand\r\nin hand the progress of just principles. The privileges, civil and\r\nreligious, of the humblest individual are still sacredly protected at\r\nhome, and while the valor and fortitude of our people have removed far\r\nfrom us the slightest apprehension of foreign power, they have not yet\r\ninduced us in a single instance to forget what is right. Our commerce\r\nhas been extended to the remotest nations; the value and even nature of\r\nour productions have been greatly changed; a wide difference has arisen\r\nin the relative wealth and resources of every portion of our country;\r\nyet the spirit of mutual regard and of faithful adherence to existing\r\ncompacts has continued to prevail in our councils and never long been\r\nabsent from our conduct. We have learned by experience a fruitful\r\nlesson--that an implicit and undeviating adherence to the principles on\r\nwhich we set out can carry us prosperously onward through all the\r\nconflicts of circumstances and vicissitudes inseparable from the lapse\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nThe success that has thus attended our great experiment is in itself a\r\nsufficient cause for gratitude, on account of the happiness it has\r\nactually conferred and the example it has unanswerably given But to me,\r\nmy fellow-citizens, looking forward to the far-distant future with\r\nardent prayers and confiding hopes, this retrospect presents a ground\r\nfor still deeper delight. It impresses on my mind a firm belief that the\r\nperpetuity of our institutions depends upon ourselves; that if we\r\nmaintain the principles on which they were established they are destined\r\nto confer their benefits on countless generations yet to come, and that\r\nAmerica will present to every friend of mankind the cheering proof that\r\na popular government, wisely formed, is wanting in no element of\r\nendurance or strength. Fifty years ago its rapid failure was boldly\r\npredicted. Latent and uncontrollable causes of dissolution were supposed\r\nto exist even by the wise and good, and not only did unfriendly or\r\nspeculative theorists anticipate for us the fate of past republics, but\r\nthe fears of many an honest patriot overbalanced his sanguine hopes.\r\nLook back on these forebodings, not hastily but reluctantly made, and\r\nsee how in every instance they have completely failed.\r\n\r\nAn imperfect experience during the struggles of the Revolution was\r\nsupposed to warrant the belief that the people would not bear the\r\ntaxation requisite to discharge an immense public debt already incurred\r\nand to pay the necessary expenses of the Government. The cost of two wars\r\nhas been paid, not only without a murmur, but with unequaled alacrity.\r\nNo one is now left to doubt that every burden will be cheerfully borne\r\nthat may be necessary to sustain our civil institutions or guard our\r\nhonor or welfare. Indeed, all experience has shown that the willingness\r\nof the people to contribute to these ends in cases of emergency has\r\nuniformly outrun the confidence of their representatives.\r\n\r\nIn the early stages of the new Government, when all felt the imposing\r\ninfluence as they recognized the unequaled services of the first\r\nPresident, it was a common sentiment that the great weight of his\r\ncharacter could alone bind the discordant materials of our Government\r\ntogether and save us from the violence of contending factions. Since his\r\ndeath nearly forty years are gone. Party exasperation has been often\r\ncarried to its highest point; the virtue and fortitude of the people\r\nhave sometimes been greatly tried; yet our system, purified and enhanced\r\nin value by all it has encountered, still preserves its spirit of free\r\nand fearless discussion, blended with unimpaired fraternal feeling.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the people for self-government, and their willingness,\r\nfrom a high sense of duty and without those exhibitions of coercive\r\npower so generally employed in other countries, to submit to all needful\r\nrestraints and exactions of municipal law, have also been favorably\r\nexemplified in the history of the American States. Occasionally, it is\r\ntrue, the ardor of public sentiment, outrunning the regular progress of\r\nthe judicial tribunals or seeking to reach cases not denounced as\r\ncriminal by the existing law, has displayed itself in a manner\r\ncalculated to give pain to the friends of free government and to\r\nencourage the hopes of those who wish for its overthrow. These\r\noccurrences, however, have been far less frequent in our country than in\r\nany other of equal population on the globe, and with the diffusion of\r\nintelligence it may well be hoped that they will constantly diminish in\r\nfrequency and violence. The generous patriotism and sound common sense\r\nof the great mass of our fellow-citizens will assuredly in time produce\r\nthis result; for as every assumption of illegal power not only wounds\r\nthe majesty of the law, but furnishes a pretext for abridging the\r\nliberties of the people, the latter have the most direct and permanent\r\ninterest in preserving the landmarks of social order and maintaining on\r\nall occasions the inviolability of those constitutional and legal\r\nprovisions which they themselves have made.\r\n\r\nIn a supposed unfitness of our institutions for those hostile\r\nemergencies which no country can always avoid their friends found a\r\nfruitful source of apprehension, their enemies of hope. While they\r\nforesaw less promptness of action than in governments differently\r\nformed, they overlooked the far more important consideration that with\r\nus war could never be the result of individual or irresponsible will,\r\nbut must be a measure of redress for injuries sustained voluntarily\r\nresorted to by those who were to bear the necessary sacrifice, who would\r\nconsequently feel an individual interest in the contest, and whose\r\nenergy would be commensurate with the difficulties to be encountered.\r\nActual events have proved their error; the last war, far from impairing,\r\ngave new confidence to our Government, and amid recent apprehensions of\r\na similar conflict we saw that the energies of our country would not be\r\nwanting in ample season to vindicate its rights. We may not possess, as\r\nwe should not desire to possess, the extended and ever-ready military\r\norganization of other nations; we may occasionally suffer in the outset\r\nfor the want of it; but among ourselves all doubt upon this great point\r\nhas ceased, while a salutary experience will prevent a contrary opinion\r\nfrom inviting aggression from abroad.\r\n\r\nCertain danger was foretold from the extension of our territory, the\r\nmultiplication of States, and the increase of population. Our system was\r\nsupposed to be adapted only to boundaries comparatively narrow. These\r\nhave been widened beyond conjecture; the members of our Confederacy are\r\nalready doubled, and the numbers of our people are incredibly augmented.\r\nThe alleged causes of danger have long surpassed anticipation, but none\r\nof the consequences have followed. The power and influence of the\r\nRepublic have arisen to a height obvious to all mankind; respect for its\r\nauthority was not more apparent at its ancient than it is at its present\r\nlimits; new and inexhaustible sources of general prosperity have been\r\nopened; the effects of distance have been averted by the inventive\r\ngenius of our people, developed and fostered by the spirit of our\r\ninstitutions; and the enlarged variety and amount of interests,\r\nproductions, and pursuits have strengthened the chain of mutual\r\ndependence and formed a circle of mutual benefits too apparent ever to\r\nbe overlooked.\r\n\r\nIn justly balancing the powers of the Federal and State authorities\r\ndifficulties nearly insurmountable arose at the outset and subsequent\r\ncollisions were deemed inevitable. Amid these it was scarcely believed\r\npossible that a scheme of government so complex in construction could\r\nremain uninjured. From time to time embarrassments have certainly\r\noccurred; but how just is the confidence of future safety imparted by\r\nthe knowledge that each in succession has been happily removed!\r\nOverlooking partial and temporary evils as inseparable from the\r\npractical operation of all human institutions, and looking only to the\r\ngeneral result, every patriot has reason to be satisfied. While the\r\nFederal Government has successfully performed its appropriate functions\r\nin relation to foreign affairs and concerns evidently national, that of\r\nevery State has remarkably improved in protecting and developing local\r\ninterests and individual welfare; and if the vibrations of authority\r\nhave occasionally tended too much toward one or the other, it is\r\nunquestionably certain that the ultimate operation of the entire system\r\nhas been to strengthen all the existing institutions and to elevate our\r\nwhole country in prosperity and renown.\r\n\r\nThe last, perhaps the greatest, of the prominent sources of discord and\r\ndisaster supposed to lurk in our political condition was the institution\r\nof domestic slavery. Our forefathers were deeply impressed with the\r\ndelicacy of this subject, and they treated it with a forbearance so\r\nevidently wise that in spite of every sinister foreboding it never until\r\nthe present period disturbed the tranquillity of our common country.\r\nSuch a result is sufficient evidence of the justice and the patriotism\r\nof their course; it is evidence not to be mistaken that an adherence to\r\nit can prevent all embarrassment from this as well as from every other\r\nanticipated cause of difficulty or danger. Have not recent events made\r\nit obvious to the slightest reflection that the least deviation from\r\nthis spirit of forbearance is injurious to every interest, that of\r\nhumanity included? Amidst the violence of excited passions this generous\r\nand fraternal feeling has been sometimes disregarded; and standing as I\r\nnow do before my countrymen, in this high place of honor and of trust, I\r\ncan not refrain from anxiously invoking my fellow-citizens never to be\r\ndeaf to its dictates. Perceiving before my election the deep interest\r\nthis subject was beginning to excite, I believed it a solemn duty fully\r\nto make known my sentiments in regard to it, and now, when every motive\r\nfor misrepresentation has passed away, I trust that they will be\r\ncandidly weighed and understood. At least they will be my standard of\r\nconduct in the path before me. I then declared that if the desire of\r\nthose of my countrymen who were favorable to my election was gratified\r\n\"I must go into the Presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising\r\nopponent of every attempt on the part of Congress to abolish slavery in\r\nthe District of Columbia against the wishes of the slaveholding States,\r\nand also with a determination equally decided to resist the slightest\r\ninterference with it in the States where it exists.\" I submitted also to\r\nmy fellow-citizens, with fullness and frankness, the reasons which led\r\nme to this determination. The result authorizes me to believe that they\r\nhave been approved and are confided in by a majority of the people of\r\nthe United States, including those whom they most immediately affect. It\r\nnow only remains to add that no bill conflicting with these views can\r\never receive my constitutional sanction. These opinions have been\r\nadopted in the firm belief that they are in accordance with the spirit\r\nthat actuated the venerated fathers of the Republic, and that succeeding\r\nexperience has proved them to be humane, patriotic, expedient,\r\nhonorable, and just. If the agitation of this subject was intended to\r\nreach the stability of our institutions, enough has occurred to show\r\nthat it has signally failed, and that in this as in every other instance\r\nthe apprehensions of the timid and the hopes of the wicked for the\r\ndestruction of our Government are again destined to be disappointed.\r\nHere and there, indeed, scenes of dangerous excitement have occurred,\r\nterrifying instances of local violence have been witnessed, and a\r\nreckless disregard of the consequences of their conduct has exposed\r\nindividuals to popular indignation; but neither masses of the people nor\r\nsections of the country have been swerved from their devotion to the\r\nbond of union and the principles it has made sacred. It will be ever\r\nthus. Such attempts at dangerous agitation may periodically return, but\r\nwith each the object will be better understood. That predominating\r\naffection for our political system which prevails throughout our\r\nterritorial limits, that calm and enlightened judgment which ultimately\r\ngoverns our people as one vast body, will always be at hand to resist\r\nand control every effort, foreign or domestic, which aims or would lead\r\nto overthrow our institutions.\r\n\r\nWhat can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this? We look back\r\non obstacles avoided and dangers overcome, on expectations more than\r\nrealized and prosperity perfectly secured. To the hopes of the hostile,\r\nthe fears of the timid, and the doubts of the anxious actual experience\r\nhas given the conclusive reply. We have seen time gradually dispel every\r\nunfavorable foreboding and our Constitution surmount every adverse\r\ncircumstance dreaded at the outset as beyond control. Present excitement\r\nwill at all times magnify present dangers, but true philosophy must\r\nteach us that none more threatening than the past can remain to be\r\novercome; and we ought (for we have just reason) to entertain an abiding\r\nconfidence in the stability of our institutions and an entire conviction\r\nthat if administered in the true form, character, and spirit in which\r\nthey were established they are abundantly adequate to preserve to us and\r\nour children the rich blessings already derived from them, to make our\r\nbeloved land for a thousand generations that chosen spot where happiness\r\nsprings from a perfect equality of political rights.\r\n\r\nFor myself, therefore, I desire to declare that the principle that will\r\ngovern me in the high duty to which my country calls me is a strict\r\nadherence to the letter and spirit of the Constitution as it was\r\ndesigned by those who framed it. Looking back to it as a sacred\r\ninstrument carefully and not easily framed; remembering that it was\r\nthroughout a work of concession and compromise; viewing it as limited to\r\nnational objects; regarding it as leaving to the people and the States\r\nall power not explicitly parted with, I shall endeavor to preserve,\r\nprotect, and defend it by anxiously referring to its provision for\r\ndirection in every action. To matters of domestic concernment which it\r\nhas intrusted to the Federal Government and to such as relate to our\r\nintercourse with foreign nations I shall zealously devote myself; beyond\r\nthose limits I shall never pass.\r\n\r\nTo enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my\r\nviews on the various questions of domestic policy would be as obtrusive\r\nas it is probably unexpected. Before the suffrages of my countrymen were\r\nconferred upon me I submitted to them, with great precision, my opinions\r\non all the most prominent of these subjects. Those opinions I shall\r\nendeavor to carry out with my utmost ability.\r\n\r\nOur course of foreign policy has been so uniform and intelligible as to\r\nconstitute a rule of Executive conduct which leaves little to my\r\ndiscretion, unless, indeed, I were willing to run counter to the lights\r\nof experience and the known opinions of my constituents. We sedulously\r\ncultivate the friendship of all nations as the conditions most\r\ncompatible with our welfare and the principles of our Government. We\r\ndecline alliances as adverse to our peace. We desire commercial\r\nrelations on equal terms, being ever willing to give a fair equivalent\r\nfor advantages received. We endeavor to conduct our intercourse with\r\nopenness and sincerity, promptly avowing our objects and seeking to\r\nestablish that mutual frankness which is as beneficial in the dealings\r\nof nations as of men. We have no disposition and we disclaim all right\r\nto meddle in disputes, whether internal or foreign, that may molest\r\nother countries, regarding them in their actual state as social\r\ncommunities, and preserving a strict neutrality in all their\r\ncontroversies. Well knowing the tried valor of our people and our\r\nexhaustless resources, we neither anticipate nor fear any designed\r\naggression; and in the consciousness of our own just conduct we feel a\r\nsecurity that we shall never be called upon to exert our determination\r\nnever to permit an invasion of our rights without punishment or redress.\r\n\r\nIn approaching, then, in the presence of my assembled countrymen, to\r\nmake the solemn promise that yet remains, and to pledge myself that I\r\nwill faithfully execute the office I am about to fill, I bring with me a\r\nsettled purpose to maintain the institutions of my country, which I\r\ntrust will atone for the errors I commit.\r\n\r\nIn receiving from the people the sacred trust twice confided to my\r\nillustrious predecessor, and which he has discharged so faithfully and\r\nso well, I know that I can not expect to perform the arduous task with\r\nequal ability and success. But united as I have been in his counsels, a\r\ndaily witness of his exclusive and unsurpassed devotion to his country's\r\nwelfare, agreeing with him in sentiments which his countrymen have\r\nwarmly supported, and permitted to partake largely of his confidence, I\r\nmay hope that somewhat of the same cheering approbation will be found to\r\nattend upon my path. For him I but express with my own the wishes of\r\nall, that he may yet long live to enjoy the brilliant evening of his\r\nwell-spent life; and for myself, conscious of but one desire, faithfully\r\nto serve my country, I throw myself without fear on its justice and its\r\nkindness. Beyond that I only look to the gracious protection of the\r\nDivine Being whose strengthening support I humbly solicit, and whom I\r\nfervently pray to look down upon us all. May it be among the\r\ndispensations of His providence to bless our beloved country with honors\r\nand with length of days. May her ways be ways of pleasantness and all\r\nher paths be peace!\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY HARRISON, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1841\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  President Harrison has the dual distinction among\r\nall the Presidents of giving the longest inaugural speech and of serving\r\nthe shortest term of office. Known to the public as \"Old Tippecanoe,\"\r\nthe former general of the Indian campaigns delivered an\r\nhour-and-forty-five-minute speech in a snowstorm. The oath of office\r\nwas administered on the East Portico of the Capitol by Chief Justice\r\nRoger Taney. The 68-year-old President stood outside for the entire\r\nproceeding, greeted crowds of well-wishers at the White House later that\r\nday, and attended several celebrations that evening. One month later he\r\ndied of pneumonia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCalled from a retirement which I had supposed was to continue for the\r\nresidue of my life to fill the chief executive office of this great and\r\nfree nation, I appear before you, fellow-citizens, to take the oaths\r\nwhich the Constitution prescribes as a necessary qualification for the\r\nperformance of its duties; and in obedience to a custom coeval with our\r\nGovernment and what I believe to be your expectations I proceed to\r\npresent to you a summary of the principles which will govern me in the\r\ndischarge of the duties which I shall be called upon to perform.\r\n\r\nIt was the remark of a Roman consul in an early period of that\r\ncelebrated Republic that a most striking contrast was observable in the\r\nconduct of candidates for offices of power and trust before and after\r\nobtaining them, they seldom carrying out in the latter case the pledges\r\nand promises made in the former. However much the world may have\r\nimproved in many respects in the lapse of upward of two thousand years\r\nsince the remark was made by the virtuous and indignant Roman, I fear\r\nthat a strict examination of the annals of some of the modern elective\r\ngovernments would develop similar instances of violated confidence.\r\n\r\nAlthough the fiat of the people has gone forth proclaiming me the Chief\r\nMagistrate of this glorious Union, nothing upon their part remaining to\r\nbe done, it may be thought that a motive may exist to keep up the\r\ndelusion under which they may be supposed to have acted in relation to\r\nmy principles and opinions; and perhaps there may be some in this\r\nassembly who have come here either prepared to condemn those I shall now\r\ndeliver, or, approving them, to doubt the sincerity with which they are\r\nnow uttered. But the lapse of a few months will confirm or dispel their\r\nfears. The outline of principles to govern and measures to be adopted by\r\nan Administration not yet begun will soon be exchanged for immutable\r\nhistory, and I shall stand either exonerated by my countrymen or classed\r\nwith the mass of those who promised that they might deceive and\r\nflattered with the intention to betray. However strong may be my present\r\npurpose to realize the expectations of a magnanimous and confiding\r\npeople, I too well understand the dangerous temptations to which I shall\r\nbe exposed from the magnitude of the power which it has been the\r\npleasure of the people to commit to my hands not to place my chief\r\nconfidence upon the aid of that Almighty Power which has hitherto\r\nprotected me and enabled me to bring to favorable issues other important\r\nbut still greatly inferior trusts heretofore confided to me by my\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe broad foundation upon which our Constitution rests being the\r\npeople--a breath of theirs having made, as a breath can unmake, change,\r\nor modify it--it can be assigned to none of the great divisions of\r\ngovernment but to that of democracy. If such is its theory, those who\r\nare called upon to administer it must recognize as its leading principle\r\nthe duty of shaping their measures so as to produce the greatest good to\r\nthe greatest number. But with these broad admissions, if we would\r\ncompare the sovereignty acknowledged to exist in the mass of our people\r\nwith the power claimed by other sovereignties, even by those which have\r\nbeen considered most purely democratic, we shall find a most essential\r\ndifference. All others lay claim to power limited only by their own\r\nwill. The majority of our citizens, on the contrary, possess a\r\nsovereignty with an amount of power precisely equal to that which has\r\nbeen granted to them by the parties to the national compact, and nothing\r\nbeyond. We admit of no government by divine right, believing that so far\r\nas power is concerned the Beneficent Creator has made no distinction\r\namongst men; that all are upon an equality, and that the only legitimate\r\nright to govern is an express grant of power from the governed. The\r\nConstitution of the United States is the instrument containing this\r\ngrant of power to the several departments composing the Government. On\r\nan examination of that instrument it will be found to contain\r\ndeclarations of power granted and of power withheld. The latter is also\r\nsusceptible of division into power which the majority had the right to\r\ngrant, but which they do not think proper to intrust to their agents,\r\nand that which they could not have granted, not being possessed by\r\nthemselves. In other words, there are certain rights possessed by each\r\nindividual American citizen which in his compact with the others he has\r\nnever surrendered. Some of them, indeed, he is unable to surrender,\r\nbeing, in the language of our system, unalienable. The boasted privilege\r\nof a Roman citizen was to him a shield only against a petty provincial\r\nruler, whilst the proud democrat of Athens would console himself under a\r\nsentence of death for a supposed violation of the national faith--which\r\nno one understood and which at times was the subject of the mockery of\r\nall--or the banishment from his home, his family, and his country with\r\nor without an alleged cause, that it was the act not of a single tyrant\r\nor hated aristocracy, but of his assembled countrymen. Far different is\r\nthe power of our sovereignty. It can interfere with no one's faith,\r\nprescribe forms of worship for no one's observance, inflict no\r\npunishment but after well-ascertained guilt, the result of investigation\r\nunder rules prescribed by the Constitution itself. These precious\r\nprivileges, and those scarcely less important of giving expression to\r\nhis thoughts and opinions, either by writing or speaking, unrestrained\r\nbut by the liability for injury to others, and that of a full\r\nparticipation in all the advantages which flow from the Government, the\r\nacknowledged property of all, the American citizen derives from no\r\ncharter granted by his fellow-man. He claims them because he is himself\r\na man, fashioned by the same Almighty hand as the rest of his species\r\nand entitled to a full share of the blessings with which He has endowed\r\nthem. Notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possessed by the people of\r\nthe United States and the restricted grant of power to the Government\r\nwhich they have adopted, enough has been given to accomplish all the\r\nobjects for which it was created. It has been found powerful in war, and\r\nhitherto justice has been administered, and intimate union effected,\r\ndomestic tranquillity preserved, and personal liberty secured to the\r\ncitizen. As was to be expected, however, from the defect of language and\r\nthe necessarily sententious manner in which the Constitution is written,\r\ndisputes have arisen as to the amount of power which it has actually\r\ngranted or was intended to grant.\r\n\r\nThis is more particularly the case in relation to that part of the\r\ninstrument which treats of the legislative branch, and not only as\r\nregards the exercise of powers claimed under a general clause giving\r\nthat body the authority to pass all laws necessary to carry into effect\r\nthe specified powers, but in relation to the latter also. It is,\r\nhowever, consolatory to reflect that most of the instances of alleged\r\ndeparture from the letter or spirit of the Constitution have ultimately\r\nreceived the sanction of a majority of the people. And the fact that\r\nmany of our statesmen most distinguished for talent and patriotism have\r\nbeen at one time or other of their political career on both sides of\r\neach of the most warmly disputed questions forces upon us the inference\r\nthat the errors, if errors there were, are attributable to the intrinsic\r\ndifficulty in many instances of ascertaining the intentions of the\r\nframers of the Constitution rather than the influence of any sinister or\r\nunpatriotic motive. But the great danger to our institutions does not\r\nappear to me to be in a usurpation by the Government of power not\r\ngranted by the people, but by the accumulation in one of the departments\r\nof that which was assigned to others. Limited as are the powers which\r\nhave been granted, still enough have been granted to constitute a\r\ndespotism if concentrated in one of the departments. This danger is\r\ngreatly heightened, as it has been always observable that men are less\r\njealous of encroachments of one department upon another than upon their\r\nown reserved rights. When the Constitution of the United States first\r\ncame from the hands of the Convention which formed it, many of the\r\nsternest republicans of the day were alarmed at the extent of the power\r\nwhich had been granted to the Federal Government, and more particularly\r\nof that portion which had been assigned to the executive branch. There\r\nwere in it features which appeared not to be in harmony with their ideas\r\nof a simple representative democracy or republic, and knowing the\r\ntendency of power to increase itself, particularly when exercised by a\r\nsingle individual, predictions were made that at no very remote period\r\nthe Government would terminate in virtual monarchy. It would not become\r\nme to say that the fears of these patriots have been already realized;\r\nbut as I sincerely believe that the tendency of measures and of men's\r\nopinions for some years past has been in that direction, it is, I\r\nconceive, strictly proper that I should take this occasion to repeat the\r\nassurances I have heretofore given of my determination to arrest the\r\nprogress of that tendency if it really exists and restore the Government\r\nto its pristine health and vigor, as far as this can be effected by any\r\nlegitimate exercise of the power placed in my hands.\r\n\r\nI proceed to state in as summary a manner as I can my opinion of the\r\nsources of the evils which have been so extensively complained of and\r\nthe correctives which may be applied. Some of the former are\r\nunquestionably to be found in the defects of the Constitution; others,\r\nin my judgment, are attributable to a misconstruction of some of its\r\nprovisions. Of the former is the eligibility of the same individual to a\r\nsecond term of the Presidency. The sagacious mind of Mr. Jefferson early\r\nsaw and lamented this error, and attempts have been made, hitherto\r\nwithout success, to apply the amendatory power of the States to its\r\ncorrection. As, however, one mode of correction is in the power of every\r\nPresident, and consequently in mine, it would be useless, and perhaps\r\ninvidious, to enumerate the evils of which, in the opinion of many of\r\nour fellow-citizens, this error of the sages who framed the Constitution\r\nmay have been the source and the bitter fruits which we are still to\r\ngather from it if it continues to disfigure our system. It may be\r\nobserved, however, as a general remark, that republics can commit no\r\ngreater error than to adopt or continue any feature in their systems of\r\ngovernment which may be calculated to create or increase the lover of\r\npower in the bosoms of those to whom necessity obliges them to commit\r\nthe management of their affairs; and surely nothing is more likely to\r\nproduce such a state of mind than the long continuance of an office of\r\nhigh trust. Nothing can be more corrupting, nothing more destructive of\r\nall those noble feelings which belong to the character of a devoted\r\nrepublican patriot. When this corrupting passion once takes possession\r\nof the human mind, like the love of gold it becomes insatiable. It is\r\nthe never-dying worm in his bosom, grows with his growth and strengthens\r\nwith the declining years of its victim. If this is true, it is the part\r\nof wisdom for a republic to limit the service of that officer at least\r\nto whom she has intrusted the management of her foreign relations, the\r\nexecution of her laws, and the command of her armies and navies to a\r\nperiod so short as to prevent his forgetting that he is the accountable\r\nagent, not the principal; the servant, not the master. Until an\r\namendment of the Constitution can be effected public opinion may secure\r\nthe desired object. I give my aid to it by renewing the pledge\r\nheretofore given that under no circumstances will I consent to serve a\r\nsecond term.\r\n\r\nBut if there is danger to public liberty from the acknowledged defects\r\nof the Constitution in the want of limit to the continuance of the\r\nExecutive power in the same hands, there is, I apprehend, not much less\r\nfrom a misconstruction of that instrument as it regards the powers\r\nactually given. I can not conceive that by a fair construction any or\r\neither of its provisions would be found to constitute the President a\r\npart of the legislative power. It can not be claimed from the power to\r\nrecommend, since, although enjoined as a duty upon him, it is a\r\nprivilege which he holds in common with every other citizen; and\r\nalthough there may be something more of confidence in the propriety of\r\nthe measures recommended in the one case than in the other, in the\r\nobligations of ultimate decision there can be no difference. In the\r\nlanguage of the Constitution, \"all the legislative powers\" which it\r\ngrants \"are vested in the Congress of the United States.\" It would be a\r\nsolecism in language to say that any portion of these is not included in\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, indeed, that the Constitution has given to the Executive\r\nthe power to annul the acts of the legislative body by refusing to them\r\nhis assent. So a similar power has necessarily resulted from that\r\ninstrument to the judiciary, and yet the judiciary forms no part of the\r\nLegislature. There is, it is true, this difference between these grants\r\nof power: The Executive can put his negative upon the acts of the\r\nLegislature for other cause than that of want of conformity to the\r\nConstitution, whilst the judiciary can only declare void those which\r\nviolate that instrument. But the decision of the judiciary is final in\r\nsuch a case, whereas in every instance where the veto of the Executive\r\nis applied it may be overcome by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses of\r\nCongress. The negative upon the acts of the legislative by the executive\r\nauthority, and that in the hands of one individual, would seem to be an\r\nincongruity in our system. Like some others of a similar character,\r\nhowever, it appears to be highly expedient, and if used only with the\r\nforbearance and in the spirit which was intended by its authors it may\r\nbe productive of great good and be found one of the best safeguards to\r\nthe Union. At the period of the formation of the Constitution the\r\nprinciple does not appear to have enjoyed much favor in the State\r\ngovernments. It existed but in two, and in one of these there was a\r\nplural executive. If we would search for the motives which operated upon\r\nthe purely patriotic and enlightened assembly which framed the\r\nConstitution for the adoption of a provision so apparently repugnant to\r\nthe leading democratic principle that the majority should govern, we\r\nmust reject the idea that they anticipated from it any benefit to the\r\nordinary course of legislation. They knew too well the high degree of\r\nintelligence which existed among the people and the enlightened\r\ncharacter of the State legislatures not to have the fullest confidence\r\nthat the two bodies elected by them would be worthy representatives of\r\nsuch constituents, and, of course, that they would require no aid in\r\nconceiving and maturing the measures which the circumstances of the\r\ncountry might require. And it is preposterous to suppose that a thought\r\ncould for a moment have been entertained that the President, placed at\r\nthe capital, in the center of the country, could better understand the\r\nwants and wishes of the people than their own immediate representatives,\r\nwho spend a part of every year among them, living with them, often\r\nlaboring with them, and bound to them by the triple tie of interest,\r\nduty, and affection. To assist or control Congress, then, in its\r\nordinary legislation could not, I conceive, have been the motive for\r\nconferring the veto power on the President. This argument acquires\r\nadditional force from the fact of its never having been thus used by the\r\nfirst six Presidents--and two of them were members of the Convention,\r\none presiding over its deliberations and the other bearing a larger\r\nshare in consummating the labors of that august body than any other\r\nperson. But if bills were never returned to Congress by either of the\r\nPresidents above referred to upon the ground of their being inexpedient\r\nor not as well adapted as they might be to the wants of the people, the\r\nveto was applied upon that of want of conformity to the Constitution or\r\nbecause errors had been committed from a too hasty enactment.\r\n\r\nThere is another ground for the adoption of the veto principle, which\r\nhad probably more influence in recommending it to the Convention than\r\nany other. I refer to the security which it gives to the just and\r\nequitable action of the Legislature upon all parts of the Union. It\r\ncould not but have occurred to the Convention that in a country so\r\nextensive, embracing so great a variety of soil and climate, and\r\nconsequently of products, and which from the same causes must ever\r\nexhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of its\r\nvarious sections, calling for a great diversity in the employments of\r\nthe people, that the legislation of the majority might not always justly\r\nregard the rights and interests of the minority, and that acts of this\r\ncharacter might be passed under an express grant by the words of the\r\nConstitution, and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary\r\nto declare void; that however enlightened and patriotic they might\r\nsuppose from past experience the members of Congress might be, and\r\nhowever largely partaking, in the general, of the liberal feelings of\r\nthe people, it was impossible to expect that bodies so constituted\r\nshould not sometimes be controlled by local interests and sectional\r\nfeelings. It was proper, therefore, to provide some umpire from whose\r\nsituation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from\r\nsuch influences might be expected. Such a one was afforded by the\r\nexecutive department constituted by the Constitution. A person elected\r\nto that high office, having his constituents in every section, State,\r\nand subdivision of the Union, must consider himself bound by the most\r\nsolemn sanctions to guard, protect, and defend the rights of all and of\r\nevery portion, great or small, from the injustice and oppression of the\r\nrest. I consider the veto power, therefore, given by the Constitution to\r\nthe Executive of the United States solely as a conservative power, to be\r\nused only first, to protect the Constitution from violation; secondly,\r\nthe people from the effects of hasty legislation where their will has\r\nbeen probably disregarded or not well understood, and, thirdly, to\r\nprevent the effects of combinations violative of the rights of\r\nminorities. In reference to the second of these objects I may observe\r\nthat I consider it the right and privilege of the people to decide\r\ndisputed points of the Constitution arising from the general grant of\r\npower to Congress to carry into effect the powers expressly given; and I\r\nbelieve with Mr. Madison that \"repeated recognitions under varied\r\ncircumstances in acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial\r\nbranches of the Government, accompanied by indications in different\r\nmodes of the concurrence of the general will of the nation,\" as\r\naffording to the President sufficient authority for his considering such\r\ndisputed points as settled.\r\n\r\nUpward of half a century has elapsed since the adoption of the present\r\nform of government. It would be an object more highly desirable than the\r\ngratification of the curiosity of speculative statesmen if its precise\r\nsituation could be ascertained, a fair exhibit made of the operations of\r\neach of its departments, of the powers which they respectively claim and\r\nexercise, of the collisions which have occurred between them or between\r\nthe whole Government and those of the States or either of them. We could\r\nthen compare our actual condition after fifty years' trial of our system\r\nwith what it was in the commencement of its operations and ascertain\r\nwhether the predictions of the patriots who opposed its adoption or the\r\nconfident hopes of its advocates have been best realized. The great\r\ndread of the former seems to have been that the reserved powers of the\r\nStates would be absorbed by those of the Federal Government and a\r\nconsolidated power established, leaving to the States the shadow only of\r\nthat independent action for which they had so zealously contended and on\r\nthe preservation of which they relied as the last hope of liberty.\r\nWithout denying that the result to which they looked with so much\r\napprehension is in the way of being realized, it is obvious that they\r\ndid not clearly see the mode of its accomplishment. The General\r\nGovernment has seized upon none of the reserved rights of the States. AS\r\nfar as any open warfare may have gone, the State authorities have amply\r\nmaintained their rights. To a casual observer our system presents no\r\nappearance of discord between the different members which compose it.\r\nEven the addition of many new ones has produced no jarring. They move in\r\ntheir respective orbits in perfect harmony with the central head and\r\nwith each other. But there is still an undercurrent at work by which, if\r\nnot seasonably checked, the worst apprehensions of our antifederal\r\npatriots will be realized, and not only will the State authorities be\r\novershadowed by the great increase of power in the executive department\r\nof the General Government, but the character of that Government, if not\r\nits designation, be essentially and radically changed. This state of\r\nthings has been in part effected by causes inherent in the Constitution\r\nand in part by the never-failing tendency of political power to increase\r\nitself. By making the President the sole distributer of all the\r\npatronage of the Government the framers of the Constitution do not\r\nappear to have anticipated at how short a period it would become a\r\nformidable instrument to control the free operations of the State\r\ngovernments. Of trifling importance at first, it had early in Mr.\r\nJefferson's Administration become so powerful as to create great alarm\r\nin the mind of that patriot from the potent influence it might exert in\r\ncontrolling the freedom of the elective franchise. If such could have\r\nthen been the effects of its influence, how much greater must be the\r\ndanger at this time, quadrupled in amount as it certainly is and more\r\ncompletely under the control of the Executive will than their\r\nconstruction of their powers allowed or the forbearing characters of all\r\nthe early Presidents permitted them to make. But it is not by the extent\r\nof its patronage alone that the executive department has become\r\ndangerous, but by the use which it appears may be made of the appointing\r\npower to bring under its control the whole revenues of the country. The\r\nConstitution has declared it to be the duty of the President to see that\r\nthe laws are executed, and it makes him the Commander in Chief of the\r\nArmies and Navy of the United States. If the opinion of the most\r\napproved writers upon that species of mixed government which in modern\r\nEurope is termed monarchy in contradistinction to despotism is correct,\r\nthere was wanting no other addition to the powers of our Chief\r\nMagistrate to stamp a monarchical character on our Government but the\r\ncontrol of the public finances; and to me it appears strange indeed that\r\nanyone should doubt that the entire control which the President\r\npossesses over the officers who have the custody of the public money, by\r\nthe power of removal with or without cause, does, for all mischievous\r\npurposes at least, virtually subject the treasure also to his disposal.\r\nThe first Roman Emperor, in his attempt to seize the sacred treasure,\r\nsilenced the opposition of the officer to whose charge it had been\r\ncommitted by a significant allusion to his sword. By a selection of\r\npolitical instruments for the care of the public money a reference to\r\ntheir commissions by a President would be quite as effectual an argument\r\nas that of Caesar to the Roman knight. I am not insensible of the great\r\ndifficulty that exists in drawing a proper plan for the safe-keeping\r\nand disbursement of the public revenues, and I know the importance which\r\nhas been attached by men of great abilities and patriotism to the\r\ndivorce, as it is called, of the Treasury from the banking institutions\r\nIt is not the divorce which is complained of, but the unhallowed union\r\nof the Treasury with the executive department, which has created such\r\nextensive alarm. To this danger to our republican institutions and that\r\ncreated by the influence given to the Executive through the\r\ninstrumentality of the Federal officers I propose to apply all the\r\nremedies which may be at my command. It was certainly a great error in\r\nthe framers of the Constitution not to have made the officer at the head\r\nof the Treasury Department entirely independent of the Executive. He\r\nshould at least have been removable only upon the demand of the popular\r\nbranch of the Legislature. I have determined never to remove a Secretary\r\nof the Treasury without communicating all the circumstances attending\r\nsuch removal to both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Executive in controlling the freedom of the\r\nelective franchise through the medium of the public officers can be\r\neffectually checked by renewing the prohibition published by Mr.\r\nJefferson forbidding their interference in elections further than giving\r\ntheir own votes, and their own independence secured by an assurance of\r\nperfect immunity in exercising this sacred privilege of freemen under\r\nthe dictates of their own unbiased judgments. Never with my consent\r\nshall an officer of the people, compensated for his services out of\r\ntheir pockets, become the pliant instrument of Executive will.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of the means placed in the hands of the Executive which\r\nmight be used with greater effect for unhallowed purposes than the\r\ncontrol of the public press. The maxim which our ancestors derived from\r\nthe mother country that \"the freedom of the press is the great bulwark\r\nof civil and religious liberty\" is one of the most precious legacies\r\nwhich they have left us. We have learned, too, from our own as well as\r\nthe experience of other countries, that golden shackles, by whomsoever\r\nor by whatever pretense imposed, are as fatal to it as the iron bonds of\r\ndespotism. The presses in the necessary employment of the Government\r\nshould never be used \"to clear the guilty or to varnish crime.\" A decent\r\nand manly examination of the acts of the Government should be not only\r\ntolerated, but encouraged.\r\n\r\nUpon another occasion I have given my opinion at some length upon the\r\nimpropriety of Executive interference in the legislation of\r\nCongress--that the article in the Constitution making it the duty of\r\nthe President to communicate information and authorizing him to\r\nrecommend measures was not intended to make him the source in\r\nlegislation, and, in particular, that he should never be looked to for\r\nschemes of finance. It would be very strange, indeed, that the\r\nConstitution should have strictly forbidden one branch of the\r\nLegislature from interfering in the origination of such bills and that\r\nit should be considered proper that an altogether different department\r\nof the Government should be permitted to do so. Some of our best\r\npolitical maxims and opinions have been drawn from our parent isle.\r\nThere are others, however, which can not be introduced in our system\r\nwithout singular incongruity and the production of much mischief, and\r\nthis I conceive to be one. No matter in which of the houses of\r\nParliament a bill may originate nor by whom introduced--a minister or a\r\nmember of the opposition--by the fiction of law, or rather of\r\nconstitutional principle, the sovereign is supposed to have prepared it\r\nagreeably to his will and then submitted it to Parliament for their\r\nadvice and consent. Now the very reverse is the case here, not only with\r\nregard to the principle, but the forms prescribed by the Constitution.\r\nThe principle certainly assigns to the only body constituted by the\r\nConstitution (the legislative body) the power to make laws, and the\r\nforms even direct that the enactment should be ascribed to them. The\r\nSenate, in relation to revenue bills, have the right to propose\r\namendments, and so has the Executive by the power given him to return\r\nthem to the House of Representatives with his objections. It is in his\r\npower also to propose amendments in the existing revenue laws, suggested\r\nby his observations upon their defective or injurious operation. But the\r\ndelicate duty of devising schemes of revenue should be left where the\r\nConstitution has placed it--with the immediate representatives of the\r\npeople. For similar reasons the mode of keeping the public treasure\r\nshould be prescribed by them, and the further removed it may be from the\r\ncontrol of the Executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more\r\nin accordance with republican principle.\r\n\r\nConnected with this subject is the character of the currency. The idea\r\nof making it exclusively metallic, however well intended, appears to me\r\nto be fraught with more fatal consequences than any other scheme having\r\nno relation to the personal rights of the citizens that has ever been\r\ndevised. If any single scheme could produce the effect of arresting at\r\nonce that mutation of condition by which thousands of our most indigent\r\nfellow-citizens by their industry and enterprise are raised to the\r\npossession of wealth, that is the one. If there is one measure better\r\ncalculated than another to produce that state of things so much\r\ndeprecated by all true republicans, by which the rich are daily adding\r\nto their hoards and the poor sinking deeper into penury, it is an\r\nexclusive metallic currency. Or if there is a process by which the\r\ncharacter of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be\r\ndestroyed by the great increase and neck toleration of usury, it is an\r\nexclusive metallic currency.\r\n\r\nAmongst the other duties of a delicate character which the President is\r\ncalled upon to perform is the supervision of the government of the\r\nTerritories of the United States. Those of them which are destined to\r\nbecome members of our great political family are compensated by their\r\nrapid progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary\r\ndeprivation of their political rights. It is in this District only where\r\nAmerican citizens are to be found who under a settled policy are\r\ndeprived of many important political privileges without any inspiring\r\nhope as to the future. Their only consolation under circumstances of\r\nsuch deprivation is that of the devoted exterior guards of a camp--that\r\ntheir sufferings secure tranquillity and safety within. Are there any of\r\ntheir countrymen, who would subject them to greater sacrifices, to any\r\nother humiliations than those essentially necessary to the security of\r\nthe object for which they were thus separated from their\r\nfellow-citizens? Are their rights alone not to be guaranteed by the\r\napplication of those great principles upon which all our constitutions\r\nare founded? We are told by the greatest of British orators and\r\nstatesmen that at the commencement of the War of the Revolution the most\r\nstupid men in England spoke of \"their American subjects.\" Are there,\r\nindeed, citizens of any of our States who have dreamed of their subjects\r\nin the District of Columbia? Such dreams can never be realized by any\r\nagency of mine. The people of the District of Columbia are not the\r\nsubjects of the people of the States, but free American citizens. Being\r\nin the latter condition when the Constitution was formed, no words used\r\nin that instrument could have been intended to deprive them of that\r\ncharacter. If there is anything in the great principle of unalienable\r\nrights so emphatically insisted upon in our Declaration of Independence,\r\nthey could neither make nor the United States accept a surrender of\r\ntheir liberties and become the subjects--in other words, the slaves--of\r\ntheir former fellow-citizens. If this be true--and it will scarcely be\r\ndenied by anyone who has a correct idea of his own rights as an American\r\ncitizen--the grant to Congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the District\r\nof Columbia can be interpreted, so far as respects the aggregate people\r\nof the United States, as meaning nothing more than to allow to Congress\r\nthe controlling power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of\r\nthe functions assigned to the General Government by the Constitution. In\r\nall other respects the legislation of Congress should be adapted to\r\ntheir peculiar position and wants and be conformable with their\r\ndeliberate opinions of their own interests.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the necessity of keeping the respective departments of\r\nthe Government, as well as all the other authorities of our country,\r\nwithin their appropriate orbits. This is a matter of difficulty in some\r\ncases, as the powers which they respectively claim are often not defined\r\nby any distinct lines. Mischievous, however, in their tendencies as\r\ncollisions of this kind may be, those which arise between the respective\r\ncommunities which for certain purposes compose one nation are much more\r\nso, for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of\r\nthose feelings of confidence and affection which are the effective bonds\r\nto union between free and confederated states. Strong as is the tie of\r\ninterest, it has been often found ineffectual. Men blinded by their\r\npassions have been known to adopt measures for their country in direct\r\nopposition to all the suggestions of policy. The alternative, then, is\r\nto destroy or keep down a bad passion by creating and fostering a good\r\none, and this seems to be the corner stone upon which our American\r\npolitical architects have reared the fabric of our Government. The\r\ncement which was to bind it and perpetuate its existence was the\r\naffectionate attachment between all its members. To insure the\r\ncontinuance of this feeling, produced at first by a community of\r\ndangers, of sufferings, and of interests, the advantages of each were\r\nmade accessible to all. No participation in any good possessed by any\r\nmember of our extensive Confederacy, except in domestic government, was\r\nwithheld from the citizen of any other member. By a process attended\r\nwith no difficulty, no delay, no expense but that of removal, the\r\ncitizen of one might become the citizen of any other, and successively\r\nof the whole. The lines, too, separating powers to be exercised by the\r\ncitizens of one State from those of another seem to be so distinctly\r\ndrawn as to leave no room for misunderstanding. The citizens of each\r\nState unite in their persons all the privileges which that character\r\nconfers and all that they may claim as citizens of the United States,\r\nbut in no case can the same persons at the same time act as the citizen\r\nof two separate States, and he is therefore positively precluded from\r\nany interference with the reserved powers of any State but that of which\r\nhe is for the time being a citizen. He may, indeed, offer to the\r\ncitizens of other States his advice as to their management, and the form\r\nin which it is tendered is left to his own discretion and sense of\r\npropriety. It may be observed, however, that organized associations of\r\ncitizens requiring compliance with their wishes too much resemble the\r\nrecommendations of Athens to her allies, supported by an armed and\r\npowerful fleet. It was, indeed, to the ambition of the leading States of\r\nGreece to control the domestic concerns of the others that the\r\ndestruction of that celebrated Confederacy, and subsequently of all its\r\nmembers, is mainly to be attributed, and it is owing to the absence of\r\nthat spirit that the Helvetic Confederacy has for so many years been\r\npreserved. Never has there been seen in the institutions of the separate\r\nmembers of any confederacy more elements of discord. In the principles\r\nand forms of government and religion, as well as in the circumstances of\r\nthe several Cantons, so marked a discrepancy was observable as to\r\npromise anything but harmony in their intercourse or permanency in their\r\nalliance, and yet for ages neither has been interrupted. Content with\r\nthe positive benefits which their union produced, with the independence\r\nand safety from foreign aggression which it secured, these sagacious\r\npeople respected the institutions of each other, however repugnant to\r\ntheir own principles and prejudices.\r\n\r\nOur Confederacy, fellow-citizens, can only be preserved by the same\r\nforbearance. Our citizens must be content with the exercise of the\r\npowers with which the Constitution clothes them. The attempt of those of\r\none State to control the domestic institutions of another can only\r\nresult in feelings of distrust and jealousy, the certain harbingers of\r\ndisunion, violence, and civil war, and the ultimate destruction of our\r\nfree institutions. Our Confederacy is perfectly illustrated by the terms\r\nand principles governing a common copartnership. There is a fund of\r\npower to be exercised under the direction of the joint councils of the\r\nallied members, but that which has been reserved by the individual\r\nmembers is intangible by the common Government or the individual members\r\ncomposing it. To attempt it finds no support in the principles of our\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nIt should be our constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a\r\nspirit of concord and harmony among the various parts of our\r\nConfederacy. Experience has abundantly taught us that the agitation by\r\ncitizens of one part of the Union of a subject not confided to the\r\nGeneral Government, but exclusively under the guardianship of the local\r\nauthorities, is productive of no other consequences than bitterness,\r\nalienation, discord, and injury to the very cause which is intended to\r\nbe advanced. Of all the great interests which appertain to our country,\r\nthat of union--cordial, confiding, fraternal union--is by far the most\r\nimportant, since it is the only true and sure guaranty of all others.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the embarrassed state of business and the currency,\r\nsome of the States may meet with difficulty in their financial concerns.\r\nHowever deeply we may regret anything imprudent or excessive in the\r\nengagements into which States have entered for purposes of their own, it\r\ndoes not become us to disparage the States governments, nor to\r\ndiscourage them from making proper efforts for their own relief. On the\r\ncontrary, it is our duty to encourage them to the extent of our\r\nconstitutional authority to apply their best means and cheerfully to\r\nmake all necessary sacrifices and submit to all necessary burdens to\r\nfulfill their engagements and maintain their credit, for the character\r\nand credit of the several States form a part of the character and credit\r\nof the whole country. The resources of the country are abundant, the\r\nenterprise and activity of our people proverbial, and we may well hope\r\nthat wise legislation and prudent administration by the respective\r\ngovernments, each acting within its own sphere, will restore former\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nUnpleasant and even dangerous as collisions may sometimes be between the\r\nconstituted authorities of the citizens of our country in relation to\r\nthe lines which separate their respective jurisdictions, the results can\r\nbe of no vital injury to our institutions if that ardent patriotism,\r\nthat devoted attachment to liberty, that spirit of moderation and\r\nforbearance for which our countrymen were once distinguished, continue\r\nto be cherished. If this continues to be the ruling passion of our\r\nsouls, the weaker feeling of the mistaken enthusiast will be corrected,\r\nthe Utopian dreams of the scheming politician dissipated, and the\r\ncomplicated intrigues of the demagogue rendered harmless. The spirit of\r\nliberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our institutions\r\nmay receive. On the contrary, no care that can be used in the\r\nconstruction of our Government, no division of powers, no distribution\r\nof checks in its several departments, will prove effectual to keep us a\r\nfree people if this spirit is suffered to decay; and decay it will\r\nwithout constant nurture. To the neglect of this duty the best\r\nhistorians agree in attributing the ruin of all the republics with whose\r\nexistence and fall their writings have made us acquainted. The same\r\ncauses will ever produce the same effects, and as long as the love of\r\npower is a dominant passion of the human bosom, and as long as the\r\nunderstandings of men can be warped and their affections changed by\r\noperations upon their passions and prejudices, so long will the\r\nliberties of a people depend on their own constant attention to its\r\npreservation. The danger to all well-established free governments arises\r\nfrom the unwillingness of the people to believe in its existence or from\r\nthe influence of designing men diverting their attention from the\r\nquarter whence it approaches to a source from which it can never come.\r\nThis is the old trick of those who would usurp the government of their\r\ncountry. In the name of democracy they speak, warning the people against\r\nthe influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy. History, ancient\r\nand modern, is full of such examples. Caesar became the master of the\r\nRoman people and the senate under the pretense of supporting the\r\ndemocratic claims of the former against the aristocracy of the latter;\r\nCromwell, in the character of protector of the liberties of the people,\r\nbecame the dictator of England, and Bolivar possessed himself of\r\nunlimited power with the title of his country's liberator. There is, on\r\nthe contrary, no instance on record of an extensive and\r\nwell-established republic being changed into an aristocracy. The\r\ntendencies of all such governments in their decline is to monarchy, and\r\nthe antagonist principle to liberty there is the spirit of faction--a\r\nspirit which assumes the character and in times of great excitement\r\nimposes itself upon the people as the genuine spirit of freedom, and,\r\nlike the false Christs whose coming was foretold by the Savior, seeks\r\nto, and were it possible would, impose upon the true and most faithful\r\ndisciples of liberty. It is in periods like this that it behooves the\r\npeople to be most watchful of those to whom they have intrusted power.\r\nAnd although there is at times much difficulty in distinguishing the\r\nfalse from the true spirit, a calm and dispassionate investigation will\r\ndetect the counterfeit, as well by the character of its operations as\r\nthe results that are produced. The true spirit of liberty, although\r\ndevoted, persevering, bold, and uncompromising in principle, that\r\nsecured is mild and tolerant and scrupulous as to the means it employs,\r\nwhilst the spirit of party, assuming to be that of liberty, is harsh,\r\nvindictive, and intolerant, and totally reckless as to the character of\r\nthe allies which it brings to the aid of its cause. When the genuine\r\nspirit of liberty animates the body of a people to a thorough\r\nexamination of their affairs, it leads to the excision of every\r\nexcrescence which may have fastened itself upon any of the departments\r\nof the government, and restores the system to its pristine health and\r\nbeauty. But the reign of an intolerant spirit of party amongst a free\r\npeople seldom fails to result in a dangerous accession to the executive\r\npower introduced and established amidst unusual professions of devotion\r\nto democracy.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks relate almost exclusively to matters connected\r\nwith our domestic concerns. It may be proper, however, that I should\r\ngive some indications to my fellow-citizens of my proposed course of\r\nconduct in the management of our foreign relations. I assure them,\r\ntherefore, that it is my intention to use every means in my power to\r\npreserve the friendly intercourse which now so happily subsists with\r\nevery foreign nation, and that although, of course, not well informed as\r\nto the state of pending negotiations with any of them, I see in the\r\npersonal characters of the sovereigns, as well as in the mutual\r\ninterests of our own and of the governments with which our relations are\r\nmost intimate, a pleasing guaranty that the harmony so important to the\r\ninterests of their subjects as well as of our citizens will not be\r\ninterrupted by the advancement of any claim or pretension upon their\r\npart to which our honor would not permit us to yield. Long the defender\r\nof my country's rights in the field, I trust that my fellow-citizens\r\nwill not see in my earnest desire to preserve peace with foreign powers\r\nany indication that their rights will ever be sacrificed or the honor of\r\nthe nation tarnished by any admission on the part of their Chief\r\nMagistrate unworthy of their former glory. In our intercourse with our\r\naboriginal neighbors the same liberality and justice which marked the\r\ncourse prescribed to me by two of my illustrious predecessors when\r\nacting under their direction in the discharge of the duties of\r\nsuperintendent and commissioner shall be strictly observed. I can\r\nconceive of no more sublime spectacle, none more likely to propitiate an\r\nimpartial and common Creator, than a rigid adherence to the principles\r\nof justice on the part of a powerful nation in its transactions with a\r\nweaker and uncivilized people whom circumstances have placed at its\r\ndisposal.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, fellow-citizens, I must say something to you on the\r\nsubject of the parties at this time existing in our country. To me it\r\nappears perfectly clear that the interest of that country requires that\r\nthe violence of the spirit by which those parties are at this time\r\ngoverned must be greatly mitigated, if not entirely extinguished, or\r\nconsequences will ensue which are appalling to be thought of.\r\n\r\nIf parties in a republic are necessary to secure a degree of vigilance\r\nsufficient to keep the public functionaries within the bounds of law and\r\nduty, at that point their usefulness ends. Beyond that they become\r\ndestructive of public virtue, the parent of a spirit antagonist to that\r\nof liberty, and eventually its inevitable conqueror. We have examples of\r\nrepublics where the love of country and of liberty at one time were the\r\ndominant passions of the whole mass of citizens, and yet, with the\r\ncontinuance of the name and forms of free government, not a vestige of\r\nthese qualities remaining in the bosoms of any one of its citizens. It\r\nwas the beautiful remark of a distinguished English writer that \"in the\r\nRoman senate Octavius had a party and Anthony a party, but the\r\nCommonwealth had none.\" Yet the senate continued to meet in the temple\r\nof liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the Commonwealth and\r\ngaze at the statues of the elder Brutus and of the Curtii and Decii, and\r\nthe people assembled in the forum, not, as in the days of Camillus and\r\nthe Scipios, to cast their free votes for annual magistrates or pass\r\nupon the acts of the senate, but to receive from the hands of the\r\nleaders of the respective parties their share of the spoils and to shout\r\nfor one or the other, as those collected in Gaul or Egypt and the lesser\r\nAsia would furnish the larger dividend. The spirit of liberty had fled,\r\nand, avoiding the abodes of civilized man, had sought protection in the\r\nwilds of Scythia or Scandinavia; and so under the operation of the same\r\ncauses and influences it will fly from our Capitol and our forums. A\r\ncalamity so awful, not only to our country, but to the world, must be\r\ndeprecated by every patriot and every tendency to a state of things\r\nlikely to produce it immediately checked. Such a tendency has\r\nexisted--does exist. Always the friend of my countrymen, never their\r\nflatterer, it becomes my duty to say to them from this high place to\r\nwhich their partiality has exalted me that there exists in the land a\r\nspirit hostile to their best interests--hostile to liberty itself. It is\r\na spirit contracted in its views, selfish in its objects. It looks to\r\nthe aggrandizement of a few even to the destruction of the interests of\r\nthe whole. The entire remedy is with the people. Something, however, may\r\nbe effected by the means which they have placed in my hands. It is union\r\nthat we want, not of a party for the sake of that party, but a union of\r\nthe whole country for the sake of the whole country, for the defense of\r\nits interests and its honor against foreign aggression, for the defense\r\nof those principles for which our ancestors so gloriously contended. As\r\nfar as it depends upon me it shall be accomplished. All the influence\r\nthat I possess shall be exerted to prevent the formation at least of an\r\nExecutive party in the halls of the legislative body. I wish for the\r\nsupport of no member of that body to any measure of mine that does not\r\nsatisfy his judgment and his sense of duty to those from whom he holds\r\nhis appointment, nor any confidence in advance from the people but that\r\nasked for by Mr. Jefferson, \"to give firmness and effect to the legal\r\nadministration of their affairs.\"\r\n\r\nI deem the present occasion sufficiently important and solemn to justify\r\nme in expressing to my fellow-citizens a profound reverence for the\r\nChristian religion and a thorough conviction that sound morals,\r\nreligious liberty, and a just sense of religious responsibility are\r\nessentially connected with all true and lasting happiness; and to that\r\ngood Being who has blessed us by the gifts of civil and religious\r\nfreedom, who watched over and prospered the labors of our fathers and\r\nhas hitherto preserved to us institutions far exceeding in excellence\r\nthose of any other people, let us unite in fervently commending every\r\ninterest of our beloved country in all future time.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, being fully invested with that high office to which the\r\npartiality of my countrymen has called me, I now take an affectionate\r\nleave of you. You will bear with you to your homes the remembrance of\r\nthe pledge I have this day given to discharge all the high duties of my\r\nexalted station according to the best of my ability, and I shall enter\r\nupon their performance with entire confidence in the support of a just\r\nand generous people.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES KNOX POLK, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, MARCH 4, 1845\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The inaugural ceremonies of former Tennessee\r\nGovernor and Speaker of the House James Knox Polk were conducted before\r\na large crowd that stood in the pouring rain. The popular politician had\r\nbeen nominated on the ninth ballot as his party's candidate. His name\r\nhad not been in nomination until the third polling of the delegates at\r\nthe national convention. The outgoing President Tyler, who had taken\r\noffice upon the death of William Henry Harrison, rode to the Capitol\r\nwith Mr. Polk. The oath of office was administered on the East Portico\r\nby Chief Justice Roger Taney. The events of the ceremony were\r\ntelegraphed to Baltimore by Samuel Morse on his year-old invention.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nWithout solicitation on my part, I have been chosen by the free and\r\nvoluntary suffrages of my countrymen to the most honorable and most\r\nresponsible office on earth. I am deeply impressed with gratitude for\r\nthe confidence reposed in me. Honored with this distinguished\r\nconsideration at an earlier period of life than any of my predecessors,\r\nI can not disguise the diffidence with which I am about to enter on the\r\ndischarge of my official duties.\r\n\r\nIf the more aged and experienced men who have filled the office of\r\nPresident of the United States even in the infancy of the Republic\r\ndistrusted their ability to discharge the duties of that exalted\r\nstation, what ought not to be the apprehensions of one so much younger\r\nand less endowed now that our domain extends from ocean to ocean, that\r\nour people have so greatly increased in numbers, and at a time when so\r\ngreat diversity of opinion prevails in regard to the principles and\r\npolicy which should characterize the administration of our Government?\r\nWell may the boldest fear and the wisest tremble when incurring\r\nresponsibilities on which may depend our country's peace and prosperity,\r\nand in some degree the hopes and happiness of the whole human family.\r\n\r\nIn assuming responsibilities so vast I fervently invoke the aid of that\r\nAlmighty Ruler of the Universe in whose hands are the destinies of\r\nnations and of men to guard this Heaven-favored land against the\r\nmischiefs which without His guidance might arise from an unwise public\r\npolicy. With a firm reliance upon the wisdom of Omnipotence to sustain\r\nand direct me in the path of duty which I am appointed to pursue, I\r\nstand in the presence of this assembled multitude of my countrymen to\r\ntake upon myself the solemn obligation \"to the best of my ability to\r\npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nA concise enumeration of the principles which will guide me in the\r\nadministrative policy of the Government is not only in accordance with\r\nthe examples set me by all my predecessors, but is eminently befitting\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution itself, plainly written as it is, the safeguard of our\r\nfederative compact, the offspring of concession and compromise, binding\r\ntogether in the bonds of peace and union this great and increasing\r\nfamily of free and independent States, will be the chart by which I\r\nshall be directed.\r\n\r\nIt will be my first care to administer the Government in the true spirit\r\nof that instrument, and to assume no powers not expressly granted or\r\nclearly implied in its terms. The Government of the United States is one\r\nof delegated and limited powers, and it is by a strict adherence to the\r\nclearly granted powers and by abstaining from the exercise of doubtful\r\nor unauthorized implied powers that we have the only sure guaranty\r\nagainst the recurrence of those unfortunate collisions between the\r\nFederal and State authorities which have occasionally so much disturbed\r\nthe harmony of our system and even threatened the perpetuity of our\r\nglorious Union.\r\n\r\n\"To the States, respectively, or to the people\" have been reserved \"the\r\npowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor\r\nprohibited by it to the States.\" Each State is a complete sovereignty\r\nwithin the sphere of its reserved powers. The Government of the Union,\r\nacting within the sphere of its delegated authority, is also a complete\r\nsovereignty. While the General Government should abstain from the\r\nexercise of authority not clearly delegated to it, the States should be\r\nequally careful that in the maintenance of their rights they do not\r\noverstep the limits of powers reserved to them. One of the most\r\ndistinguished of my predecessors attached deserved importance to \"the\r\nsupport of the State governments in all their rights, as the most\r\ncompetent administration for our domestic concerns and the surest\r\nbulwark against antirepublican tendencies,\" and to the \"preservation of\r\nthe General Government in its whole constitutional vigor, as the sheet\r\nanchor of our peace at home and safety abroad.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Government of the United States has been intrusted the exclusive\r\nmanagement of our foreign affairs. Beyond that it wields a few general\r\nenumerated powers. It does not force reform on the States. It leaves\r\nindividuals, over whom it casts its protecting influence, entirely free\r\nto improve their own condition by the legitimate exercise of all their\r\nmental and physical powers. It is a common protector of each and all the\r\nStates; of every man who lives upon our soil, whether of native or\r\nforeign birth; of every religious sect, in their worship of the Almighty\r\naccording to the dictates of their own conscience; of every shade of\r\nopinion, and the most free inquiry; of every art, trade, and occupation\r\nconsistent with the laws of the States. And we rejoice in the general\r\nhappiness, prosperity, and advancement of our country, which have been\r\nthe offspring of freedom, and not of power.\r\n\r\nThis most admirable and wisest system of well-regulated self-government\r\namong men ever devised by human minds has been tested by its successful\r\noperation for more than half a century, and if preserved from the\r\nusurpations of the Federal Government on the one hand and the exercise\r\nby the States of powers not reserved to them on the other, will, I\r\nfervently hope and believe, endure for ages to come and dispense the\r\nblessings of civil and religious liberty to distant generations. To\r\neffect objects so dear to every patriot I shall devote myself with\r\nanxious solicitude. It will be my desire to guard against that most\r\nfruitful source of danger to the harmonious action of our system which\r\nconsists in substituting the mere discretion and caprice of the\r\nExecutive or of majorities in the legislative department of the\r\nGovernment for powers which have been withheld from the Federal\r\nGovernment by the Constitution. By the theory of our Government\r\nmajorities rule, but this right is not an arbitrary or unlimited one. It\r\nis a right to be exercised in subordination to the Constitution and in\r\nconformity to it. One great object of the Constitution was to restrain\r\nmajorities from oppressing minorities or encroaching upon their just\r\nrights. Minorities have a right to appeal to the Constitution as a\r\nshield against such oppression.\r\n\r\nThat the blessings of liberty which our Constitution secures may be\r\nenjoyed alike by minorities and majorities, the Executive has been\r\nwisely invested with a qualified veto upon the acts of the Legislature.\r\nIt is a negative power, and is conservative in its character. It arrests\r\nfor the time hasty, inconsiderate, or unconstitutional legislation,\r\ninvites reconsideration, and transfers questions at issue between the\r\nlegislative and executive departments to the tribunal of the people.\r\nLike all other powers, it is subject to be abused. When judiciously and\r\nproperly exercised, the Constitution itself may be saved from infraction\r\nand the rights of all preserved and protected.\r\n\r\nThe inestimable value of our Federal Union is felt and acknowledged by\r\nall. By this system of united and confederated States our people are\r\npermitted collectively and individually to seek their own happiness in\r\ntheir own way, and the consequences have been most auspicious. Since the\r\nUnion was formed the number of the States has increased from thirteen to\r\ntwenty-eight; two of these have taken their position as members of the\r\nConfederacy within the last week. Our population has increased from\r\nthree to twenty millions. New communities and States are seeking\r\nprotection under its aegis, and multitudes from the Old World are\r\nflocking to our shores to participate in its blessings. Beneath its\r\nbenign sway peace and prosperity prevail. Freed from the burdens and\r\nmiseries of war, our trade and intercourse have extended throughout the\r\nworld. Mind, no longer tasked in devising means to accomplish or resist\r\nschemes of ambition, usurpation, or conquest, is devoting itself to\r\nman's true interests in developing his faculties and powers and the\r\ncapacity of nature to minister to his enjoyments. Genius is free to\r\nannounce its inventions and discoveries, and the hand is free to\r\naccomplish whatever the head conceives not incompatible with the rights\r\nof a fellow-being. All distinctions of birth or of rank have been\r\nabolished. All citizens, whether native or adopted, are placed upon\r\nterms of precise equality. All are entitled to equal rights and equal\r\nprotection. No union exists between church and state, and perfect\r\nfreedom of opinion is guaranteed to all sects and creeds.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the blessings secured to our happy land by our Federal\r\nUnion. To perpetuate them it is our sacred duty to preserve it. Who\r\nshall assign limits to the achievements of free minds and free hands\r\nunder the protection of this glorious Union? No treason to mankind since\r\nthe organization of society would be equal in atrocity to that of him\r\nwho would lift his hand to destroy it. He would overthrow the noblest\r\nstructure of human wisdom, which protects himself and his fellow-man. He\r\nwould stop the progress of free government and involve his country\r\neither in anarchy or despotism. He would extinguish the fire of liberty,\r\nwhich warms and animates the hearts of happy millions and invites all\r\nthe nations of the earth to imitate our example. If he say that error\r\nand wrong are committed in the administration of the Government, let him\r\nremember that nothing human can be perfect, and that under no other\r\nsystem of government revealed by Heaven or devised by man has reason\r\nbeen allowed so free and broad a scope to combat error. Has the sword of\r\ndespots proved to be a safer or surer instrument of reform in government\r\nthan enlightened reason? Does he expect to find among the ruins of this\r\nUnion a happier abode for our swarming millions than they now have under\r\nit? Every lover of his country must shudder at the thought of the\r\npossibility of its dissolution, and will be ready to adopt the patriotic\r\nsentiment, \"Our Federal Union--it must be preserved.\" To preserve it the\r\ncompromises which alone enabled our fathers to form a common\r\nconstitution for the government and protection of so many States and\r\ndistinct communities, of such diversified habits, interests, and\r\ndomestic institutions, must be sacredly and religiously observed. Any\r\nattempt to disturb or destroy these compromises, being terms of the\r\ncompact of union, can lead to none other than the most ruinous and\r\ndisastrous consequences.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of deep regret that in some sections of our country\r\nmisguided persons have occasionally indulged in schemes and agitations\r\nwhose object is the destruction of domestic institutions existing in\r\nother sections--institutions which existed at the adoption of the\r\nConstitution and were recognized and protected by it. All must see that\r\nif it were possible for them to be successful in attaining their object\r\nthe dissolution of the Union and the consequent destruction of our happy\r\nform of government must speedily follow.\r\n\r\nI am happy to believe that at every period of our existence as a nation\r\nthere has existed, and continues to exist, among the great mass of our\r\npeople a devotion to the Union of the States which will shield and\r\nprotect it against the moral treason of any who would seriously\r\ncontemplate its destruction. To secure a continuance of that devotion\r\nthe compromises of the Constitution must not only be preserved, but\r\nsectional jealousies and heartburnings must be discountenanced, and all\r\nshould remember that they are members of the same political family,\r\nhaving a common destiny. To increase the attachment of our people to the\r\nUnion, our laws should be just. Any policy which shall tend to favor\r\nmonopolies or the peculiar interests of sections or classes must operate\r\nto the prejudice of the interest of their fellow-citizens, and should\r\nbe avoided. If the compromises of the Constitution be preserved, if\r\nsectional jealousies and heartburnings be discountenanced, if our laws\r\nbe just and the Government be practically administered strictly within\r\nthe limits of power prescribed to it, we may discard all apprehensions\r\nfor the safety of the Union.\r\n\r\nWith these views of the nature, character, and objects of the Government\r\nand the value of the Union, I shall steadily oppose the creation of\r\nthose institutions and systems which in their nature tend to pervert it\r\nfrom its legitimate purposes and make it the instrument of sections,\r\nclasses, and individuals. We need no national banks or other extraneous\r\ninstitutions planted around the Government to control or strengthen it\r\nin opposition to the will of its authors. Experience has taught us how\r\nunnecessary they are as auxiliaries of the public authorities--how\r\nimpotent for good and how powerful for mischief.\r\n\r\nOurs was intended to be a plain and frugal government, and I shall\r\nregard it to be my duty to recommend to Congress and, as far as the\r\nExecutive is concerned, to enforce by all the means within my power the\r\nstrictest economy in the expenditure of the public money which may be\r\ncompatible with the public interests.\r\n\r\nA national debt has become almost an institution of European monarchies.\r\nIt is viewed in some of them as an essential prop to existing\r\ngovernments. Melancholy is the condition of that people whose government\r\ncan be sustained only by a system which periodically transfers large\r\namounts from the labor of the many to the coffers of the few. Such a\r\nsystem is incompatible with the ends for which our republican Government\r\nwas instituted. Under a wise policy the debts contracted in our\r\nRevolution and during the War of 1812 have been happily extinguished. By\r\na judicious application of the revenues not required for other necessary\r\npurposes, it is not doubted that the debt which has grown out of the\r\ncircumstances of the last few years may be speedily paid off.\r\n\r\nI congratulate my fellow-citizens on the entire restoration of the\r\ncredit of the General Government of the Union and that of many of the\r\nStates. Happy would it be for the indebted States if they were freed\r\nfrom their liabilities, many of which were incautiously contracted.\r\nAlthough the Government of the Union is neither in a legal nor a moral\r\nsense bound for the debts of the States, and it would be a violation of\r\nour compact of union to assume them, yet we can not but feel a deep\r\ninterest in seeing all the States meet their public liabilities and pay\r\noff their just debts at the earliest practicable period. That they will\r\ndo so as soon as it can be done without imposing too heavy burdens on\r\ntheir citizens there is no reason to doubt. The sound moral and\r\nhonorable feeling of the people of the indebted States can not be\r\nquestioned, and we are happy to perceive a settled disposition on their\r\npart, as their ability returns after a season of unexampled pecuniary\r\nembarrassment, to pay off all just demands and to acquiesce in any\r\nreasonable measures to accomplish that object.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties which we have had to encounter in the practical\r\nadministration of the Government consists in the adjustment of our\r\nrevenue laws and the levy of the taxes necessary for the support of\r\nGovernment. In the general proposition that no more money shall be\r\ncollected than the necessities of an economical administration shall\r\nrequire all parties seem to acquiesce. Nor does there seem to be any\r\nmaterial difference of opinion as to the absence of right in the\r\nGovernment to tax one section of country, or one class of citizens, or\r\none occupation, for the mere profit of another. \"Justice and sound\r\npolicy forbid the Federal Government to foster one branch of industry to\r\nthe detriment of another, or to cherish the interests of one portion to\r\nthe injury of another portion of our common country.\" I have heretofore\r\ndeclared to my fellow-citizens that \"in my judgment it is the duty of\r\nthe Government to extend, as far as it may be practicable to do so, by\r\nits revenue laws and all other means within its power, fair and just\r\nprotection to all of the great interests of the whole Union, embracing\r\nagriculture, manufactures, the mechanic arts, commerce, and navigation.\"\r\nI have also declared my opinion to be \"in favor of a tariff for\r\nrevenue,\" and that \"in adjusting the details of such a tariff I have\r\nsanctioned such moderate discriminating duties as would produce the\r\namount of revenue needed and at the same time afford reasonable\r\nincidental protection to our home industry,\" and that I was \"opposed to\r\na tariff for protection merely, and not for revenue.\"\r\n\r\nThe power \"to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises\" was\r\nan indispensable one to be conferred on the Federal Government, which\r\nwithout it would possess no means of providing for its own support. In\r\nexecuting this power by levying a tariff of duties for the support of\r\nGovernment, the raising of revenue should be the object and protection\r\nthe incident. To reverse this principle and make protection the object\r\nand revenue the incident would be to inflict manifest injustice upon all\r\nother than the protected interests. In levying duties for revenue it is\r\ndoubtless proper to make such discriminations within the revenue\r\nprinciple as will afford incidental protection to our home interests.\r\nWithin the revenue limit there is a discretion to discriminate; beyond\r\nthat limit the rightful exercise of the power is not conceded. The\r\nincidental protection afforded to our home interests by discriminations\r\nwithin the revenue range it is believed will be ample. In making\r\ndiscriminations all our home interests should as far as practicable be\r\nequally protected. The largest portion of our people are agriculturists.\r\nOthers are employed in manufactures, commerce, navigation, and the\r\nmechanic arts. They are all engaged in their respective pursuits and\r\ntheir joint labors constitute the national or home industry. To tax one\r\nbranch of this home industry for the benefit of another would be unjust.\r\nNo one of these interests can rightfully claim an advantage over the\r\nothers, or to be enriched by impoverishing the others. All are equally\r\nentitled to the fostering care and protection of the Government. In\r\nexercising a sound discretion in levying discriminating duties within\r\nthe limit prescribed, care should be taken that it be done in a manner\r\nnot to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the toiling millions by\r\ntaxing lowest the luxuries of life, or articles of superior quality and\r\nhigh price, which can only be consumed by the wealthy, and highest the\r\nnecessaries of life, or articles of coarse quality and low price, which\r\nthe poor and great mass of our people must consume. The burdens of\r\ngovernment should as far as practicable be distributed justly and\r\nequally among all classes of our population. These general views, long\r\nentertained on this subject, I have deemed it proper to reiterate. It is\r\na subject upon which conflicting interests of sections and occupations\r\nare supposed to exist, and a spirit of mutual concession and compromise\r\nin adjusting its details should be cherished by every part of our\r\nwidespread country as the only means of preserving harmony and a\r\ncheerful acquiescence of all in the operation of our revenue laws. Our\r\npatriotic citizens in every part of the Union will readily submit to the\r\npayment of such taxes as shall be needed for the support of their\r\nGovernment, whether in peace or in war, if they are so levied as to\r\ndistribute the burdens as equally as possible among them.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Texas has made known her desire to come into our Union,\r\nto form a part of our Confederacy and enjoy with us the blessings of\r\nliberty secured and guaranteed by our Constitution. Texas was once a\r\npart of our country--was unwisely ceded away to a foreign power--is now\r\nindependent, and possesses an undoubted right to dispose of a part or\r\nthe whole of her territory and to merge her sovereignty as a separate\r\nand independent state in ours. I congratulate my country that by an act\r\nof the late Congress of the United States the assent of this Government\r\nhas been given to the reunion, and it only remains for the two countries\r\nto agree upon the terms to consummate an object so important to both.\r\n\r\nI regard the question of annexation as belonging exclusively to the\r\nUnited States and Texas. They are independent powers competent to\r\ncontract, and foreign nations have no right to interfere with them or to\r\ntake exceptions to their reunion. Foreign powers do not seem to\r\nappreciate the true character of our Government. Our Union is a\r\nconfederation of independent States, whose policy is peace with each\r\nother and all the world. To enlarge its limits is to extend the\r\ndominions of peace over additional territories and increasing millions.\r\nThe world has nothing to fear from military ambition in our Government.\r\nWhile the Chief Magistrate and the popular branch of Congress are\r\nelected for short terms by the suffrages of those millions who must in\r\ntheir own persons bear all the burdens and miseries of war, our\r\nGovernment can not be otherwise than pacific. Foreign powers should\r\ntherefore look on the annexation of Texas to the United States not as\r\nthe conquest of a nation seeking to extend her dominions by arms and\r\nviolence, but as the peaceful acquisition of a territory once her own,\r\nby adding another member to our confederation, with the consent of that\r\nmember, thereby diminishing the chances of war and opening to them new\r\nand ever-increasing markets for their products.\r\n\r\nTo Texas the reunion is important, because the strong protecting arm of\r\nour Government would be extended over her, and the vast resources of her\r\nfertile soil and genial climate would be speedily developed, while the\r\nsafety of New Orleans and of our whole southwestern frontier against\r\nhostile aggression, as well as the interests of the whole Union, would\r\nbe promoted by it.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier stages of our national existence the opinion prevailed\r\nwith some that our system of confederated States could not operate\r\nsuccessfully over an extended territory, and serious objections have at\r\ndifferent times been made to the enlargement of our boundaries. These\r\nobjections were earnestly urged when we acquired Louisiana. Experience\r\nhas shown that they were not well founded. The title of numerous Indian\r\ntribes to vast tracts of country has been extinguished; new States have\r\nbeen admitted into the Union; new Territories have been created and our\r\njurisdiction and laws extended over them. As our population has\r\nexpanded, the Union has been cemented and strengthened. AS our\r\nboundaries have been enlarged and our agricultural population has been\r\nspread over a large surface, our federative system has acquired\r\nadditional strength and security. It may well be doubted whether it\r\nwould not be in greater danger of overthrow if our present population\r\nwere confined to the comparatively narrow limits of the original\r\nthirteen States than it is now that they are sparsely settled over a\r\nmore expanded territory. It is confidently believed that our system may\r\nbe safely extended to the utmost bounds of our territorial limits, and\r\nthat as it shall be extended the bonds of our Union, so far from being\r\nweakened, will become stronger.\r\n\r\nNone can fail to see the danger to our safety and future peace if Texas\r\nremains an independent state or becomes an ally or dependency of some\r\nforeign nation more powerful than herself. Is there one among our\r\ncitizens who would not prefer perpetual peace with Texas to occasional\r\nwars, which so often occur between bordering independent nations? Is\r\nthere one who would not prefer free intercourse with her to high duties\r\non all our products and manufactures which enter her ports or cross her\r\nfrontiers? Is there one who would not prefer an unrestricted\r\ncommunication with her citizens to the frontier obstructions which must\r\noccur if she remains out of the Union? Whatever is good or evil in the\r\nlocal institutions of Texas will remain her own whether annexed to the\r\nUnited States or not. None of the present States will be responsible for\r\nthem any more than they are for the local institutions of each other.\r\nThey have confederated together for certain specified objects. Upon the\r\nsame principle that they would refuse to form a perpetual union with\r\nTexas because of her local institutions our forefathers would have been\r\nprevented from forming our present Union. Perceiving no valid objection\r\nto the measure and many reasons for its adoption vitally affecting the\r\npeace, the safety, and the prosperity of both countries, I shall on the\r\nbroad principle which formed the basis and produced the adoption of our\r\nConstitution, and not in any narrow spirit of sectional policy, endeavor\r\nby all Constitutional, honorable, and appropriate means to consummate\r\nthe expressed will of the people and Government of the United States by\r\nthe reannexation of Texas to our Union at the earliest practicable\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nNor will it become in a less degree my duty to assert and maintain by\r\nall constitutional means the right of the United States to that portion\r\nof our territory which lies beyond the Rocky Mountains. Our title to the\r\ncountry of the Oregon is \"clear and unquestionable,\" and already are our\r\npeople preparing to perfect that title by occupying it with their wives\r\nand children. But eighty years ago our population was confined on the\r\nwest by the ridge of the Alleghanies. Within that period--within the\r\nlifetime, I might say, of some of my hearers--our people, increasing to\r\nmany millions, have filled the eastern valley of the Mississippi,\r\nadventurously ascended the Missouri to its headsprings, and are already\r\nengaged in establishing the blessings of self-government in valleys of\r\nwhich the rivers flow to the Pacific. The world beholds the peaceful\r\ntriumphs of the industry of our emigrants. To us belongs the duty of\r\nprotecting them adequately wherever they may be upon our soil. The\r\njurisdiction of our laws and the benefits of our republican institutions\r\nshould be extended over them in the distant regions which they have\r\nselected for their homes. The increasing facilities of intercourse will\r\neasily bring the States, of which the formation in that part of our\r\nterritory can not be long delayed, within the sphere of our federative\r\nUnion. In the meantime every obligation imposed by treaty or\r\nconventional stipulations should be sacredly respected.\r\n\r\nIn the management of our foreign relations it will be my aim to observe\r\na careful respect for the rights of other nations, while our own will be\r\nthe subject of constant watchfulness. Equal and exact justice should\r\ncharacterize all our intercourse with foreign countries. All alliances\r\nhaving a tendency to jeopard the welfare and honor of our country or\r\nsacrifice any one of the national interests will be studiously avoided,\r\nand yet no opportunity will be lost to cultivate a favorable\r\nunderstanding with foreign governments by which our navigation and\r\ncommerce may be extended and the ample products of our fertile soil, as\r\nwell as the manufactures of our skillful artisans, find a ready market\r\nand remunerating prices in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nIn taking \"care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" a strict\r\nperformance of duty will be exacted from all public officers. From those\r\nofficers, especially, who are charged with the collection and\r\ndisbursement of the public revenue will prompt and rigid accountability\r\nbe required. Any culpable failure or delay on their part to account for\r\nthe moneys intrusted to them at the times and in the manner required by\r\nlaw will in every instance terminate the official connection of such\r\ndefaulting officer with the Government.\r\n\r\nAlthough in our country the Chief Magistrate must almost of necessity be\r\nchosen by a party and stand pledged to its principles and measures, yet\r\nin his official action he should not be the President of a part only,\r\nbut of the whole people of the United States. While he executes the laws\r\nwith an impartial hand, shrinks from no proper responsibility, and\r\nfaithfully carries out in the executive department of the Government the\r\nprinciples and policy of those who have chosen him, he should not be\r\nunmindful that our fellow-citizens who have differed with him in opinion\r\nare entitled to the full and free exercise of their opinions and\r\njudgments, and that the rights of all are entitled to respect and\r\nregard.\r\n\r\nConfidently relying upon the aid and assistance of the coordinate\r\ndepartments of the Government in conducting our public affairs, I enter\r\nupon the discharge of the high duties which have been assigned me by the\r\npeople, again humbly supplicating that Divine Being who has watched over\r\nand protected our beloved country from its infancy to the present hour\r\nto continue His gracious benedictions upon us, that we may continue to\r\nbe a prosperous and happy people.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZACHARY TAYLOR, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MARCH 5, 1849\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  For the second time in the history of the Republic,\r\nMarch 4 fell on a Sunday. The inaugural ceremony was postponed until the\r\nfollowing Monday, raising the question as to whether the Nation was\r\nwithout a President for a day. General Taylor, popularly known as \"Old\r\nRough and Ready,\" was famous for his exploits in the Mexican War. He\r\nnever had voted in a national election until his own contest for the\r\nPresidency. Outgoing President Polk accompanied the general to the\r\nceremony at the Capitol. The oath of office was administered by Chief\r\nJustice Roger Taney on the East Portico. After the ceremony, the new\r\nPresident attended several inaugural celebrations, including a ball that\r\nevening in a specially built pavilion on Judiciary Square.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElected by the American people to the highest office known to our laws,\r\nI appear here to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution, and, in\r\ncompliance with a time-honored custom, to address those who are now\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nThe confidence and respect shown by my countrymen in calling me to be\r\nthe Chief Magistrate of a Republic holding a high rank among the nations\r\nof the earth have inspired me with feelings of the most profound\r\ngratitude; but when I reflect that the acceptance of the office which\r\ntheir partiality has bestowed imposes the discharge of the most arduous\r\nduties and involves the weightiest obligations, I am conscious that the\r\nposition which I have been called to fill, though sufficient to satisfy\r\nthe loftiest ambition, is surrounded by fearful responsibilities.\r\nHappily, however, in the performance of my new duties I shall not be\r\nwithout able cooperation. The legislative and judicial branches of the\r\nGovernment present prominent examples of distinguished civil attainments\r\nand matured experience, and it shall be my endeavor to call to my\r\nassistance in the Executive Departments individuals whose talents,\r\nintegrity, and purity of character will furnish ample guaranties for the\r\nfaithful and honorable performance of the trusts to be committed to\r\ntheir charge. With such aids and an honest purpose to do whatever is\r\nright, I hope to execute diligently, impartially, and for the best\r\ninterests of the country the manifold duties devolved upon me.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of these duties my guide will be the Constitution,\r\nwhich I this day swear to \"preserve, protect, and defend.\" For the\r\ninterpretation of that instrument I shall look to the decisions of the\r\njudicial tribunals established by its authority and to the practice of\r\nthe Government under the earlier Presidents, who had so large a share in\r\nits formation. To the example of those illustrious patriots I shall\r\nalways defer with reverence, and especially to his example who was by so\r\nmany titles \"the Father of his Country.\"\r\n\r\nTo command the Army and Navy of the United States; with the advice and\r\nconsent of the Senate, to make treaties and to appoint ambassadors and\r\nother officers; to give to Congress information of the state of the\r\nUnion and recommend such measures as he shall judge to be necessary; and\r\nto take care that the laws shall be faithfully executed--these are the\r\nmost important functions intrusted to the President by the Constitution,\r\nand it may be expected that I shall briefly indicate the principles\r\nwhich will control me in their execution.\r\n\r\nChosen by the body of the people under the assurance that my\r\nAdministration would be devoted to the welfare of the whole country, and\r\nnot to the support of any particular section or merely local interest, I\r\nthis day renew the declarations I have heretofore made and proclaim my\r\nfixed determination to maintain to the extent of my ability the\r\nGovernment in its original purity and to adopt as the basis of my public\r\npolicy those great republican doctrines which constitute the strength of\r\nour national existence.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the Army and Navy, lately employed with so much\r\ndistinction on active service, care shall be taken to insure the highest\r\ncondition of efficiency, and in furtherance of that object the military\r\nand naval schools, sustained by the liberality of Congress, shall\r\nreceive the special attention of the Executive.\r\n\r\nAs American freemen we can not but sympathize in all efforts to extend\r\nthe blessings of civil and political liberty, but at the same time we\r\nare warned by the admonitions of history and the voice of our own\r\nbeloved Washington to abstain from entangling alliances with foreign\r\nnations. In all disputes between conflicting governments it is our\r\ninterest not less than our duty to remain strictly neutral, while our\r\ngeographical position, the genius of our institutions and our people,\r\nthe advancing spirit of civilization, and, above all, the dictates of\r\nreligion direct us to the cultivation of peaceful and friendly relations\r\nwith all other powers. It is to be hoped that no international question\r\ncan now arise which a government confident in its own strength and\r\nresolved to protect its own just rights may not settle by wise\r\nnegotiation; and it eminently becomes a government like our own, founded\r\non the morality and intelligence of its citizens and upheld by their\r\naffections, to exhaust every resort of honorable diplomacy before\r\nappealing to arms. In the conduct of our foreign relations I shall\r\nconform to these views, as I believe them essential to the best\r\ninterests and the true honor of the country.\r\n\r\nThe appointing power vested in the President imposes delicate and\r\nonerous duties. So far as it is possible to be informed, I shall make\r\nhonesty, capacity, and fidelity indispensable prerequisites to the\r\nbestowal of office, and the absence of either of these qualities shall\r\nbe deemed sufficient cause for removal.\r\n\r\nIt shall be my study to recommend such constitutional measures to\r\nCongress as may be necessary and proper to secure encouragement and\r\nprotection to the great interests of agriculture, commerce, and\r\nmanufactures, to improve our rivers and harbors, to provide for the\r\nspeedy extinguishment of the public debt, to enforce a strict\r\naccountability on the part of all officers of the Government and the\r\nutmost economy in all public expenditures; but it is for the wisdom of\r\nCongress itself, in which all legislative powers are vested by the\r\nConstitution, to regulate these and other matters of domestic policy. I\r\nshall look with confidence to the enlightened patriotism of that body to\r\nadopt such measures of conciliation as may harmonize conflicting\r\ninterests and tend to perpetuate that Union which should be the\r\nparamount object of our hopes and affections. In any action calculated\r\nto promote an object so near the heart of everyone who truly loves his\r\ncountry I will zealously unite with the coordinate branches of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I congratulate you, my fellow-citizens, upon the high\r\nstate of prosperity to which the goodness of Divine Providence has\r\nconducted our common country. Let us invoke a continuance of the same\r\nprotecting care which has led us from small beginnings to the eminence\r\nwe this day occupy, and let us seek to deserve that continuance by\r\nprudence and moderation in our councils, by well-directed attempts to\r\nassuage the bitterness which too often marks unavoidable differences of\r\nopinion, by the promulgation and practice of just and liberal\r\nprinciples, and by an enlarged patriotism, which shall acknowledge no\r\nlimits but those of our own widespread Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN PIERCE, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, MARCH 4, 1853\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  On religious grounds, former Senator and Congressman\r\nFranklin Pierce chose \"to affirm\" rather than \"to swear\" the executive\r\noath of office. He was the only President to use the choice offered by\r\nthe Constitution. Famed as an officer of a volunteer brigade in the\r\nMexican War, he was nominated as the Democratic candidate in the\r\nnational convention on the 49th ballot. His name had not been placed in\r\nnomination until the 35th polling of the delegates. Chief Justice Roger\r\nTaney administered the oath of office on the East Portico of the\r\nCapitol. Several weeks before arriving in Washington, the Pierces' only\r\nsurviving child had been killed in a train accident.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Countrymen:\r\n\r\nIt is a relief to feel that no heart but my own can know the personal\r\nregret and bitter sorrow over which I have been borne to a position so\r\nsuitable for others rather than desirable for myself.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which I have been called for a limited period to\r\npreside over the destinies of the Republic fill me with a profound sense\r\nof responsibility, but with nothing like shrinking apprehension. I\r\nrepair to the post assigned me not as to one sought, but in obedience to\r\nthe unsolicited expression of your will, answerable only for a fearless,\r\nfaithful, and diligent exercise of my best powers. I ought to be, and\r\nam, truly grateful for the rare manifestation of the nation's\r\nconfidence; but this, so far from lightening my obligations, only adds\r\nto their weight. You have summoned me in my weakness; you must sustain\r\nme by your strength. When looking for the fulfillment of reasonable\r\nrequirements, you will not be unmindful of the great changes which have\r\noccurred, even within the last quarter of a century, and the consequent\r\naugmentation and complexity of duties imposed in the administration both\r\nof your home and foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nWhether the elements of inherent force in the Republic have kept pace\r\nwith its unparalleled progression in territory, population, and wealth\r\nhas been the subject of earnest thought and discussion on both sides of\r\nthe ocean. Less than sixty-four years ago the Father of his Country made\r\n\"the\" then \"recent accession of the important State of North Carolina to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States\" one of the subjects of his\r\nspecial congratulation. At that moment, however, when the agitation\r\nconsequent upon the Revolutionary struggle had hardly subsided, when we\r\nwere just emerging from the weakness and embarrassments of the\r\nConfederation, there was an evident consciousness of vigor equal to the\r\ngreat mission so wisely and bravely fulfilled by our fathers. It was not\r\na presumptuous assurance, but a calm faith, springing from a clear view\r\nof the sources of power in a government constituted like ours. It is no\r\nparadox to say that although comparatively weak the new-born nation was\r\nintrinsically strong. Inconsiderable in population and apparent\r\nresources, it was upheld by a broad and intelligent comprehension of\r\nrights and an all-pervading purpose to maintain them, stronger than\r\narmaments. It came from the furnace of the Revolution, tempered to the\r\nnecessities of the times. The thoughts of the men of that day were as\r\npractical as their sentiments were patriotic. They wasted no portion of\r\ntheir energies upon idle and delusive speculations, but with a firm and\r\nfearless step advanced beyond the governmental landmarks which had\r\nhitherto circumscribed the limits of human freedom and planted their\r\nstandard, where it has stood against dangers which have threatened from\r\nabroad, and internal agitation, which has at times fearfully menaced at\r\nhome. They proved themselves equal to the solution of the great problem,\r\nto understand which their minds had been illuminated by the dawning\r\nlights of the Revolution. The object sought was not a thing dreamed of;\r\nit was a thing realized. They had exhibited only the power to achieve,\r\nbut, what all history affirms to be so much more unusual, the capacity\r\nto maintain. The oppressed throughout the world from that day to the\r\npresent have turned their eyes hitherward, not to find those lights\r\nextinguished or to fear lest they should wane, but to be constantly\r\ncheered by their steady and increasing radiance.\r\n\r\nIn this our country has, in my judgment, thus far fulfilled its highest\r\nduty to suffering humanity. It has spoken and will continue to speak,\r\nnot only by its words, but by its acts, the language of sympathy,\r\nencouragement, and hope to those who earnestly listen to tones which\r\npronounce for the largest rational liberty. But after all, the most\r\nanimating encouragement and potent appeal for freedom will be its own\r\nhistory--its trials and its triumphs. Preeminently, the power of our\r\nadvocacy reposes in our example; but no example, be it remembered, can\r\nbe powerful for lasting good, whatever apparent advantages may be\r\ngained, which is not based upon eternal principles of right and justice.\r\nOur fathers decided for themselves, both upon the hour to declare and\r\nthe hour to strike. They were their own judges of the circumstances\r\nunder which it became them to pledge to each other \"their lives, their\r\nfortunes, and their sacred honor\" for the acquisition of the priceless\r\ninheritance transmitted to us. The energy with which that great conflict\r\nwas opened and, under the guidance of a manifest and beneficent\r\nProvidence the uncomplaining endurance with which it was prosecuted to\r\nits consummation were only surpassed by the wisdom and patriotic spirit\r\nof concession which characterized all the counsels of the early fathers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive evidences of that wisdom is to be found in\r\nthe fact that the actual working of our system has dispelled a degree of\r\nsolicitude which at the outset disturbed bold hearts and far-reaching\r\nintellects. The apprehension of dangers from extended territory,\r\nmultiplied States, accumulated wealth, and augmented population has\r\nproved to be unfounded. The stars upon your banner have become nearly\r\nthreefold their original number; your densely populated possessions\r\nskirt the shores of the two great oceans; and yet this vast increase of\r\npeople and territory has not only shown itself compatible with the\r\nharmonious action of the States and Federal Government in their\r\nrespective constitutional spheres, but has afforded an additional\r\nguaranty of the strength and integrity of both.\r\n\r\nWith an experience thus suggestive and cheering, the policy of my\r\nAdministration will not be controlled by any timid forebodings of evil\r\nfrom expansion. Indeed, it is not to be disguised that our attitude as a\r\nnation and our position on the globe render the acquisition of certain\r\npossessions not within our jurisdiction eminently important for our\r\nprotection, if not in the future essential for the preservation of the\r\nrights of commerce and the peace of the world. Should they be obtained,\r\nit will be through no grasping spirit, but with a view to obvious\r\nnational interest and security, and in a manner entirely consistent with\r\nthe strictest observance of national faith. We have nothing in our\r\nhistory or position to invite aggression; we have everything to beckon\r\nus to the cultivation of relations of peace and amity with all nations.\r\nPurposes, therefore, at once just and pacific will be significantly\r\nmarked in the conduct of our foreign affairs. I intend that my\r\nAdministration shall leave no blot upon our fair record, and trust I may\r\nsafely give the assurance that no act within the legitimate scope of my\r\nconstitutional control will be tolerated on the part of any portion of\r\nour citizens which can not challenge a ready justification before the\r\ntribunal of the civilized world. An Administration would be unworthy of\r\nconfidence at home or respect abroad should it cease to be influenced by\r\nthe conviction that no apparent advantage can be purchased at a price so\r\ndear as that of national wrong or dishonor. It is not your privilege as\r\na nation to speak of a distant past. The striking incidents of your\r\nhistory, replete with instruction and furnishing abundant grounds for\r\nhopeful confidence, are comprised in a period comparatively brief. But\r\nif your past is limited, your future is boundless. Its obligations\r\nthrong the unexplored pathway of advancement, and will be limitless as\r\nduration. Hence a sound and comprehensive policy should embrace not less\r\nthe distant future than the urgent present.\r\n\r\nThe great objects of our pursuit as a people are best to be attained by\r\npeace, and are entirely consistent with the tranquillity and interests\r\nof the rest of mankind. With the neighboring nations upon our continent\r\nwe should cultivate kindly and fraternal relations. We can desire\r\nnothing in regard to them so much as to see them consolidate their\r\nstrength and pursue the paths of prosperity and happiness. If in the\r\ncourse of their growth we should open new channels of trade and create\r\nadditional facilities for friendly intercourse, the benefits realized\r\nwill be equal and mutual. Of the complicated European systems of\r\nnational polity we have heretofore been independent. From their wars,\r\ntheir tumults, and anxieties we have been, happily, almost entirely\r\nexempt. Whilst these are confined to the nations which gave them\r\nexistence, and within their legitimate jurisdiction, they can not affect\r\nus except as they appeal to our sympathies in the cause of human freedom\r\nand universal advancement. But the vast interests of commerce are common\r\nto all mankind, and the advantages of trade and international\r\nintercourse must always present a noble field for the moral influence of\r\na great people.\r\n\r\nWith these views firmly and honestly carried out, we have a right to\r\nexpect, and shall under all circumstances require, prompt reciprocity.\r\nThe rights which belong to us as a nation are not alone to be regarded,\r\nbut those which pertain to every citizen in his individual capacity, at\r\nhome and abroad, must be sacredly maintained. So long as he can discern\r\nevery star in its place upon that ensign, without wealth to purchase for\r\nhim preferment or title to secure for him place, it will be his\r\nprivilege, and must be his acknowledged right, to stand unabashed even\r\nin the presence of princes, with a proud consciousness that he is\r\nhimself one of a nation of sovereigns and that he can not in legitimate\r\npursuit wander so far from home that the agent whom he shall leave\r\nbehind in the place which I now occupy will not see that no rude hand of\r\npower or tyrannical passion is laid upon him with impunity. He must\r\nrealize that upon every sea and on every soil where our enterprise may\r\nrightfully seek the protection of our flag American citizenship is an\r\ninviolable panoply for the security of American rights. And in this\r\nconnection it can hardly be necessary to reaffirm a principle which\r\nshould now be regarded as fundamental. The rights, security, and repose\r\nof this Confederacy reject the idea of interference or colonization on\r\nthis side of the ocean by any foreign power beyond present jurisdiction\r\nas utterly inadmissible.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities of observation furnished by my brief experience as a\r\nsoldier confirmed in my own mind the opinion, entertained and acted upon\r\nby others from the formation of the Government, that the maintenance of\r\nlarge standing armies in our country would be not only dangerous, but\r\nunnecessary. They also illustrated the importance--I might well say the\r\nabsolute necessity--of the military science and practical skill\r\nfurnished in such an eminent degree by the institution which has made\r\nyour Army what it is, under the discipline and instruction of officers\r\nnot more distinguished for their solid attainments, gallantry, and\r\ndevotion to the public service than for unobtrusive bearing and high\r\nmoral tone. The Army as organized must be the nucleus around which in\r\nevery time of need the strength of your military power, the sure bulwark\r\nof your defense--a national militia--may be readily formed into a\r\nwell-disciplined and efficient organization. And the skill and\r\nself-devotion of the Navy assure you that you may take the performance\r\nof the past as a pledge for the future, and may confidently expect that\r\nthe flag which has waved its untarnished folds over every sea will still\r\nfloat in undiminished honor. But these, like many other subjects, will\r\nbe appropriately brought at a future time to the attention of the\r\ncoordinate branches of the Government, to which I shall always look with\r\nprofound respect and with trustful confidence that they will accord to\r\nme the aid and support which I shall so much need and which their\r\nexperience and wisdom will readily suggest.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of domestic affairs you expect a devoted integrity\r\nin the public service and an observance of rigid economy in all\r\ndepartments, so marked as never justly to be questioned. If this\r\nreasonable expectation be not realized, I frankly confess that one of\r\nyour leading hopes is doomed to disappointment, and that my efforts in a\r\nvery important particular must result in a humiliating failure. Offices\r\ncan be properly regarded only in the light of aids for the\r\naccomplishment of these objects, and as occupancy can confer no\r\nprerogative nor importunate desire for preferment any claim, the public\r\ninterest imperatively demands that they be considered with sole\r\nreference to the duties to be performed. Good citizens may well claim\r\nthe protection of good laws and the benign influence of good government,\r\nbut a claim for office is what the people of a republic should never\r\nrecognize. No reasonable man of any party will expect the Administration\r\nto be so regardless of its responsibility and of the obvious elements of\r\nsuccess as to retain persons known to be under the influence of\r\npolitical hostility and partisan prejudice in positions which will\r\nrequire not only severe labor, but cordial cooperation. Having no\r\nimplied engagements to ratify, no rewards to bestow, no resentments to\r\nremember, and no personal wishes to consult in selections for official\r\nstation, I shall fulfill this difficult and delicate trust, admitting no\r\nmotive as worthy either of my character or position which does not\r\ncontemplate an efficient discharge of duty and the best interests of my\r\ncountry. I acknowledge my obligations to the masses of my countrymen,\r\nand to them alone. Higher objects than personal aggrandizement gave\r\ndirection and energy to their exertions in the late canvass, and they\r\nshall not be disappointed. They require at my hands diligence,\r\nintegrity, and capacity wherever there are duties to be performed.\r\nWithout these qualities in their public servants, more stringent laws\r\nfor the prevention or punishment of fraud, negligence, and peculation\r\nwill be vain. With them they will be unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut these are not the only points to which you look for vigilant\r\nwatchfulness. The dangers of a concentration of all power in the general\r\ngovernment of a confederacy so vast as ours are too obvious to be\r\ndisregarded. You have a right, therefore, to expect your agents in every\r\ndepartment to regard strictly the limits imposed upon them by the\r\nConstitution of the United States. The great scheme of our\r\nconstitutional liberty rests upon a proper distribution of power between\r\nthe State and Federal authorities, and experience has shown that the\r\nharmony and happiness of our people must depend upon a just\r\ndiscrimination between the separate rights and responsibilities of the\r\nStates and your common rights and obligations under the General\r\nGovernment; and here, in my opinion, are the considerations which should\r\nform the true basis of future concord in regard to the questions which\r\nhave most seriously disturbed public tranquillity. If the Federal\r\nGovernment will confine itself to the exercise of powers clearly granted\r\nby the Constitution, it can hardly happen that its action upon any\r\nquestion should endanger the institutions of the States or interfere\r\nwith their right to manage matters strictly domestic according to the\r\nwill of their own people.\r\n\r\nIn expressing briefly my views upon an important subject rich has\r\nrecently agitated the nation to almost a fearful degree, I am moved by\r\nno other impulse than a most earnest desire for the perpetuation of that\r\nUnion which has made us what we are, showering upon us blessings and\r\nconferring a power and influence which our fathers could hardly have\r\nanticipated, even with their most sanguine hopes directed to a far-off\r\nfuture. The sentiments I now announce were not unknown before the\r\nexpression of the voice which called me here. My own position upon this\r\nsubject was clear and unequivocal, upon the record of my words and my\r\nacts, and it is only recurred to at this time because silence might\r\nperhaps be misconstrued. With the Union my best and dearest earthly\r\nhopes are entwined. Without it what are we individually or collectively?\r\nWhat becomes of the noblest field ever opened for the advancement of our\r\nrace in religion, in government, in the arts, and in all that dignifies\r\nand adorns mankind? From that radiant constellation which both illumines\r\nour own way and points out to struggling nations their course, let but a\r\nsingle star be lost, and, if these be not utter darkness, the luster of\r\nthe whole is dimmed. Do my countrymen need any assurance that such a\r\ncatastrophe is not to overtake them while I possess the power to stay\r\nit? It is with me an earnest and vital belief that as the Union has been\r\nthe source, under Providence, of our prosperity to this time, so it is\r\nthe surest pledge of a continuance of the blessings we have enjoyed, and\r\nwhich we are sacredly bound to transmit undiminished to our children.\r\nThe field of calm and free discussion in our country is open, and will\r\nalways be so, but never has been and never can be traversed for good in\r\na spirit of sectionalism and uncharitableness. The founders of the\r\nRepublic dealt with things as they were presented to them, in a spirit\r\nof self-sacrificing patriotism, and, as time has proved, with a\r\ncomprehensive wisdom which it will always be safe for us to consult.\r\nEvery measure tending to strengthen the fraternal feelings of all the\r\nmembers of our Union has had my heartfelt approbation. To every theory\r\nof society or government, whether the offspring of feverish ambition or\r\nof morbid enthusiasm, calculated to dissolve the bonds of law and\r\naffection which unite us, I shall interpose a ready and stern\r\nresistance. I believe that involuntary servitude, as it exists in\r\ndifferent States of this Confederacy, is recognized by the Constitution.\r\nI believe that it stands like any other admitted right, and that the\r\nStates where it exists are entitled to efficient remedies to enforce the\r\nconstitutional provisions. I hold that the laws of 1850, commonly called\r\nthe \"compromise measures,\" are strictly constitutional and to be\r\nunhesitatingly carried into effect. I believe that the constituted\r\nauthorities of this Republic are bound to regard the rights of the South\r\nin this respect as they would view any other legal and constitutional\r\nright, and that the laws to enforce them should be respected and obeyed,\r\nnot with a reluctance encouraged by abstract opinions as to their\r\npropriety in a different state of society, but cheerfully and according\r\nto the decisions of the tribunal to which their exposition belongs. Such\r\nhave been, and are, my convictions, and upon them I shall act. I\r\nfervently hope that the question is at rest, and that no sectional or\r\nambitious or fanatical excitement may again threaten the durability of\r\nour institutions or obscure the light of our prosperity.\r\n\r\nBut let not the foundation of our hope rest upon man's wisdom. It will\r\nnot be sufficient that sectional prejudices find no place in the public\r\ndeliberations. It will not be sufficient that the rash counsels of human\r\npassion are rejected. It must be felt that there is no national security\r\nbut in the nation's humble, acknowledged dependence upon God and His\r\noverruling providence.\r\n\r\nWe have been carried in safety through a perilous crisis. Wise counsels,\r\nlike those which gave us the Constitution, prevailed to uphold it. Let\r\nthe period be remembered as an admonition, and not as an encouragement,\r\nin any section of the Union, to make experiments where experiments are\r\nfraught with such fearful hazard. Let it be impressed upon all hearts\r\nthat, beautiful as our fabric is, no earthly power or wisdom could ever\r\nreunite its broken fragments. Standing, as I do, almost within view of\r\nthe green slopes of Monticello, and, as it were, within reach of the\r\ntomb of Washington, with all the cherished memories of the past\r\ngathering around me like so many eloquent voices of exhortation from\r\nheaven, I can express no better hope for my country than that the kind\r\nProvidence which smiled upon our fathers may enable their children to\r\npreserve the blessings they have inherited.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1857\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The Democratic Party chose another candidate instead\r\nof their incumbent President when they nominated James Buchanan at the\r\nnational convention. Since the Jackson Administration, he had a\r\ndistinguished career as a Senator, Congressman, Cabinet officer, and\r\nambassador. The oath of office was administered by Chief Justice Roger\r\nTaney on the East Portico of the Capitol. A parade had preceded the\r\nceremony at the Capitol, and an inaugural ball was held that evening for\r\n6,000 celebrants in a specially built hall on Judiciary Square.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nI appear before you this day to take the solemn oath \"that I will\r\nfaithfully execute the office of President of the United States and will\r\nto the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution\r\nof the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn entering upon this great office I must humbly invoke the God of our\r\nfathers for wisdom and firmness to execute its high and responsible\r\nduties in such a manner as to restore harmony and ancient friendship\r\namong the people of the several States and to preserve our free\r\ninstitutions throughout many generations. Convinced that I owe my\r\nelection to the inherent love for the Constitution and the Union which\r\nstill animates the hearts of the American people, let me earnestly ask\r\ntheir powerful support in sustaining all just measures calculated to\r\nperpetuate these, the richest political blessings which Heaven has ever\r\nbestowed upon any nation. Having determined not to become a candidate\r\nfor reelection, I shall have no motive to influence my conduct in\r\nadministering the Government except the desire ably and faithfully to\r\nserve my country and to live in grateful memory of my countrymen.\r\n\r\nWe have recently passed through a Presidential contest in which the\r\npassions of our fellow-citizens were excited to the highest degree by\r\nquestions of deep and vital importance; but when the people proclaimed\r\ntheir will the tempest at once subsided and all was calm.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the majority, speaking in the manner prescribed by the\r\nConstitution, was heard, and instant submission followed. Our own\r\ncountry could alone have exhibited so grand and striking a spectacle of\r\nthe capacity of man for self-government.\r\n\r\nWhat a happy conception, then, was it for Congress to apply this simple\r\nrule, that the will of the majority shall govern, to the settlement of\r\nthe question of domestic slavery in the Territories. Congress is neither\r\n\"to legislate slavery into any Territory or State nor to exclude it\r\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAs a natural consequence, Congress has also prescribed that when the\r\nTerritory of Kansas shall be admitted as a State it \"shall be received\r\ninto the Union with or without slavery, as their constitution may\r\nprescribe at the time of their admission.\"\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion has arisen in regard to the point of time when\r\nthe people of a Territory shall decide this question for themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is, happily, a matter of but little practical importance. Besides,\r\nit is a judicial question, which legitimately belongs to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, before whom it is now pending, and will, it\r\nis understood, be speedily and finally settled. To their decision, in\r\ncommon with all good citizens, I shall cheerfully submit, whatever this\r\nmay be, though it has ever been my individual opinion that under the\r\nNebraska-Kansas act the appropriate period will be when the number of\r\nactual residents in the Territory shall justify the formation of a\r\nconstitution with a view to its admission as a State into the Union. But\r\nbe this as it may, it is the imperative and indispensable duty of the\r\nGovernment of the United States to secure to every resident inhabitant\r\nthe free and independent expression of his opinion by his vote. This\r\nsacred right of each individual must be preserved. That being\r\naccomplished, nothing can be fairer than to leave the people of a\r\nTerritory free from all foreign interference to decide their own destiny\r\nfor themselves, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe whole Territorial question being thus settled upon the principle of\r\npopular sovereignty--a principle as ancient as free government\r\nitself--everything of a practical nature has been decided. No other\r\nquestion remains for adjustment, because all agree that under the\r\nConstitution slavery in the States is beyond the reach of any human\r\npower except that of the respective States themselves wherein it exists.\r\nMay we not, then, hope that the long agitation on this subject is\r\napproaching its end, and that the geographical parties to which it has\r\ngiven birth, so much dreaded by the Father of his Country, will speedily\r\nbecome extinct? Most happy will it be for the country when the public\r\nmind shall be diverted from this question to others of more pressing and\r\npractical importance. Throughout the whole progress of this agitation,\r\nwhich has scarcely known any intermission for more than twenty years,\r\nwhilst it has been productive of no positive good to any human being it\r\nhas been the prolific source of great evils to the master, to the slave,\r\nand to the whole country. It has alienated and estranged the people of\r\nthe sister States from each other, and has even seriously endangered the\r\nvery existence of the Union. Nor has the danger yet entirely ceased.\r\nUnder our system there is a remedy for all mere political evils in the\r\nsound sense and sober judgment of the people. Time is a great\r\ncorrective. Political subjects which but a few years ago excited and\r\nexasperated the public mind have passed away and are now nearly\r\nforgotten. But this question of domestic slavery is of far graver\r\nimportance than any mere political question, because should the\r\nagitation continue it may eventually endanger the personal safety of a\r\nlarge portion of our countrymen where the institution exists. In that\r\nevent no form of government, however admirable in itself and however\r\nproductive of material benefits, can compensate for the loss of peace\r\nand domestic security around the family altar. Let every Union-loving\r\nman, therefore, exert his best influence to suppress this agitation,\r\nwhich since the recent legislation of Congress is without any legitimate\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nIt is an evil omen of the times that men have undertaken to calculate\r\nthe mere material value of the Union. Reasoned estimates have been\r\npresented of the pecuniary profits and local advantages which would\r\nresult to different States and sections from its dissolution and of the\r\ncomparative injuries which such an event would inflict on other States\r\nand sections. Even descending to this low and narrow view of the mighty\r\nquestion, all such calculations are at fault. The bare reference to a\r\nsingle consideration will be conclusive on this point. We at present\r\nenjoy a free trade throughout our extensive and expanding country such\r\nas the world has never witnessed. This trade is conducted on railroads\r\nand canals, on noble rivers and arms of the sea, which bind together the\r\nNorth and the South, the East and the West, of our Confederacy.\r\nAnnihilate this trade, arrest its free progress by the geographical\r\nlines of jealous and hostile States, and you destroy the prosperity and\r\nonward march of the whole and every part and involve all in one common\r\nruin. But such considerations, important as they are in themselves, sink\r\ninto insignificance when we reflect on the terrific evils which would\r\nresult from disunion to every portion of the Confederacy--to the North,\r\nnot more than to the South, to the East not more than to the West. These\r\nI shall not attempt to portray, because I feel an humble confidence that\r\nthe kind Providence which inspired our fathers with wisdom to frame the\r\nmost perfect form of government and union ever devised by man will not\r\nsuffer it to perish until it shall have been peacefully instrumental by\r\nits example in the extension of civil and religious liberty throughout\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the maintenance of the Constitution and the Union\r\nis the duty of preserving the Government free from the taint or even the\r\nsuspicion of corruption. Public virtue is the vital spirit of republics,\r\nand history proves that when this has decayed and the love of money has\r\nusurped its place, although the forms of free government may remain for\r\na season, the substance has departed forever.\r\n\r\nOur present financial condition is without a parallel in history. No\r\nnation has ever before been embarrassed from too large a surplus in its\r\ntreasury. This almost necessarily gives birth to extravagant\r\nlegislation. It produces wild schemes of expenditure and begets a race\r\nof speculators and jobbers, whose ingenuity is exerted in contriving and\r\npromoting expedients to obtain public money. The purity of official\r\nagents, whether rightfully or wrongfully, is suspected, and the\r\ncharacter of the government suffers in the estimation of the people.\r\nThis is in itself a very great evil.\r\n\r\nThe natural mode of relief from this embarrassment is to appropriate the\r\nsurplus in the Treasury to great national objects for which a clear\r\nwarrant can be found in the Constitution. Among these I might mention\r\nthe extinguishment of the public debt, a reasonable increase of the\r\nNavy, which is at present inadequate to the protection of our vast\r\ntonnage afloat, now greater than that of any other nation, as well as to\r\nthe defense of our extended seacoast.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond all question the true principle that no more revenue ought\r\nto be collected from the people than the amount necessary to defray the\r\nexpenses of a wise, economical, and efficient administration of the\r\nGovernment. To reach this point it was necessary to resort to a\r\nmodification of the tariff, and this has, I trust, been accomplished in\r\nsuch a manner as to do as little injury as may have been practicable to\r\nour domestic manufactures, especially those necessary for the defense of\r\nthe country. Any discrimination against a particular branch for the\r\npurpose of benefiting favored corporations, individuals, or interests\r\nwould have been unjust to the rest of the community and inconsistent\r\nwith that spirit of fairness and equality which ought to govern in the\r\nadjustment of a revenue tariff.\r\n\r\nBut the squandering of the public money sinks into comparative\r\ninsignificance as a temptation to corruption when compared with the\r\nsquandering of the public lands.\r\n\r\nNo nation in the tide of time has ever been blessed with so rich and\r\nnoble an inheritance as we enjoy in the public lands. In administering\r\nthis important trust, whilst it may be wise to grant portions of them\r\nfor the improvement of the remainder, yet we should never forget that it\r\nis our cardinal policy to reserve these lands, as much as may be, for\r\nactual settlers, and this at moderate prices. We shall thus not only\r\nbest promote the prosperity of the new States and Territories, by\r\nfurnishing them a hardy and independent race of honest and industrious\r\ncitizens, but shall secure homes for our children and our children's\r\nchildren, as well as for those exiles from foreign shores who may seek\r\nin this country to improve their condition and to enjoy the blessings of\r\ncivil and religious liberty. Such emigrants have done much to promote\r\nthe growth and prosperity of the country. They have proved faithful both\r\nin peace and in war. After becoming citizens they are entitled, under\r\nthe Constitution and laws, to be placed on a perfect equality with\r\nnative-born citizens, and in this character they should ever be kindly\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution is a grant from the States to Congress of\r\ncertain specific powers, and the question whether this grant should be\r\nliberally or strictly construed has more or less divided political\r\nparties from the beginning. Without entering into the argument, I desire\r\nto state at the commencement of my Administration that long experience\r\nand observation have convinced me that a strict construction of the\r\npowers of the Government is the only true, as well as the only safe,\r\ntheory of the Constitution. Whenever in our past history doubtful powers\r\nhave been exercised by Congress, these have never failed to produce\r\ninjurious and unhappy consequences. Many such instances might be adduced\r\nif this were the proper occasion. Neither is it necessary for the public\r\nservice to strain the language of the Constitution, because all the\r\ngreat and useful powers required for a successful administration of the\r\nGovernment, both in peace and in war, have been granted, either in\r\nexpress terms or by the plainest implication.\r\n\r\nWhilst deeply convinced of these truths, I yet consider it clear that\r\nunder the war-making power Congress may appropriate money toward the\r\nconstruction of a military road when this is absolutely necessary for\r\nthe defense of any State or Territory of the Union against foreign\r\ninvasion. Under the Constitution Congress has power \"to declare war,\"\r\n\"to raise and support armies,\" \"to provide and maintain a navy,\" and to\r\ncall forth the militia to \"repel invasions.\" Thus endowed, in an ample\r\nmanner, with the war-making power, the corresponding duty is required\r\nthat \"the United States shall protect each of them [the States] against\r\ninvasion.\" Now, how is it possible to afford this protection to\r\nCalifornia and our Pacific possessions except by means of a military\r\nroad through the Territories of the United States, over which men and\r\nmunitions of war may be speedily transported from the Atlantic States to\r\nmeet and to repel the invader? In the event of a war with a naval power\r\nmuch stronger than our own we should then have no other available access\r\nto the Pacific Coast, because such a power would instantly close the\r\nroute across the isthmus of Central America. It is impossible to\r\nconceive that whilst the Constitution has expressly required Congress to\r\ndefend all the States it should yet deny to them, by any fair\r\nconstruction, the only possible means by which one of these States can\r\nbe defended. Besides, the Government, ever since its origin, has been in\r\nthe constant practice of constructing military roads. It might also be\r\nwise to consider whether the love for the Union which now animates our\r\nfellow-citizens on the Pacific Coast may not be impaired by our neglect\r\nor refusal to provide for them, in their remote and isolated condition,\r\nthe only means by which the power of the States on this side of the\r\nRocky Mountains can reach them in sufficient time to \"protect\" them\r\n\"against invasion.\" I forbear for the present from expressing an opinion\r\nas to the wisest and most economical mode in which the Government can\r\nlend its aid in accomplishing this great and necessary work. I believe\r\nthat many of the difficulties in the way, which now appear formidable,\r\nwill in a great degree vanish as soon as the nearest and best route\r\nshall have been satisfactorily ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper that on this occasion I should make some brief remarks\r\nin regard to our rights and duties as a member of the great family of\r\nnations. In our intercourse with them there are some plain principles,\r\napproved by our own experience, from which we should never depart. We\r\nought to cultivate peace, commerce, and friendship with all nations, and\r\nthis not merely as the best means of promoting our own material\r\ninterests, but in a spirit of Christian benevolence toward our\r\nfellow-men, wherever their lot may be cast. Our diplomacy should be\r\ndirect and frank, neither seeking to obtain more nor accepting less than\r\nis our due. We ought to cherish a sacred regard for the independence of\r\nall nations, and never attempt to interfere in the domestic concerns of\r\nany unless this shall be imperatively required by the great law of\r\nself-preservation. To avoid entangling alliances has been a maxim of\r\nour policy ever since the days of Washington, and its wisdom's no one\r\nwill attempt to dispute. In short, we ought to do justice in a kindly\r\nspirit to all nations and require justice from them in return.\r\n\r\nIt is our glory that whilst other nations have extended their dominions\r\nby the sword we have never acquired any territory except by fair\r\npurchase or, as in the case of Texas, by the voluntary determination of\r\na brave, kindred, and independent people to blend their destinies with\r\nour own. Even our acquisitions from Mexico form no exception. Unwilling\r\nto take advantage of the fortune of war against a sister republic, we\r\npurchased these possessions under the treaty of peace for a sum which\r\nwas considered at the time a fair equivalent. Our past history forbids\r\nthat we shall in the future acquire territory unless this be sanctioned\r\nby the laws of justice and honor. Acting on this principle, no nation\r\nwill have a right to interfere or to complain if in the progress of\r\nevents we shall still further extend our possessions. Hitherto in all\r\nour acquisitions the people, under the protection of the American flag,\r\nhave enjoyed civil and religious liberty, as well as equal and just\r\nlaws, and have been contented, prosperous, and happy. Their trade with\r\nthe rest of the world has rapidly increased, and thus every commercial\r\nnation has shared largely in their successful progress.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution,\r\nwhilst humbly invoking the blessing of Divine Providence on this great\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MARCH 4, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The national upheaval of secession was a grim\r\nreality at Abraham Lincoln's inauguration. Jefferson Davis had been\r\ninaugurated as the President of the Confederacy two weeks earlier. The\r\nformer Illinois Congressman had arrived in Washington by a secret route\r\nto avoid danger, and his movements were guarded by General Winfield\r\nScott's soldiers. Ignoring advice to the contrary, the President-elect\r\nrode with President Buchanan in an open carriage to the Capitol, where\r\nhe took the oath of office on the East Portico. Chief Justice Roger\r\nTaney administered the executive oath for the seventh time. The Capitol\r\nitself was sheathed in scaffolding because the copper and wood\r\n\"Bulfinch\" dome was being replaced with a cast iron dome designed by\r\nThomas U. Walter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens of the United States:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a custom as old as the Government itself, I appear\r\nbefore you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath\r\nprescribed by the Constitution of the United States to be taken by the\r\nPresident \"before he enters on the execution of this office.\"\r\n\r\nI do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those\r\nmatters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nApprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that\r\nby the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their\r\npeace and personal security are to be endangered. There has never been\r\nany reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample\r\nevidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to\r\ntheir inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of\r\nhim who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches\r\nwhen I declare that--\r\n\r\nI have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the\r\ninstitution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have\r\nno lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\r\n\r\nThose who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had\r\nmade this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them; and\r\nmore than this, they placed in the platform for my acceptance, and as a\r\nlaw to themselves and to me, the clear and emphatic resolution which I\r\nnow read:\r\n\r\nResolved, That the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States,\r\nand especially the right of each State to order and control its own\r\ndomestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively, is\r\nessential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance\r\nof our political fabric depend; and we denounce the lawless invasion by\r\narmed force of the soil of any State or Territory, no matter what\r\npretext, as among the gravest of crimes.\r\n\r\nI now reiterate these sentiments, and in doing so I only press upon the\r\npublic attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is\r\nsusceptible that the property, peace, and security of no section are to\r\nbe in any wise endangered by the now incoming Administration. I add,\r\ntoo, that all the protection which, consistently with the Constitution\r\nand the laws, can be given will be cheerfully given to all the States\r\nwhen lawfully demanded, for whatever cause--as cheerfully to one section\r\nas to another.\r\n\r\nThere is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from\r\nservice or labor. The clause I now read is as plainly written in the\r\nConstitution as any other of its provisions:\r\n\r\nNo person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof,\r\nescaping into another, shall in consequence of any law or regulation\r\ntherein be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered\r\nup on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who\r\nmade it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and the\r\nintention of the lawgiver is the law. All members of Congress swear\r\ntheir support to the whole Constitution--to this provision as much as to\r\nany other. To the proposition, then, that slaves whose cases come within\r\nthe terms of this clause \"shall be delivered up\" their oaths are\r\nunanimous. Now, if they would make the effort in good temper, could they\r\nnot with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which\r\nto keep good that unanimous oath?\r\n\r\nThere is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be\r\nenforced by national or by State authority, but surely that difference\r\nis not a very material one. If the slave is to be surrendered, it can be\r\nof but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is\r\ndone. And should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go\r\nunkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept?\r\n\r\nAgain: In any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of\r\nliberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced, so\r\nthat a free man be not in any case surrendered as a slave? And might it\r\nnot be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of\r\nthat clause in the Constitution which guarantees that \"the citizens of\r\neach State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of\r\ncitizens in the several States\"?\r\n\r\nI take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations and with no\r\npurpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules;\r\nand while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as\r\nproper to be enforced, I do suggest that it will be much safer for all,\r\nboth in official and private stations, to conform to and abide by all\r\nthose acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting\r\nto find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIt is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President\r\nunder our National Constitution. During that period fifteen different\r\nand greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the\r\nexecutive branch of the Government. They have conducted it through many\r\nperils, and generally with great success. Yet, with all this scope of\r\nprecedent, I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional\r\nterm of four years under great and peculiar difficulty. A disruption of\r\nthe Federal Union, heretofore only menaced, is now formidably attempted.\r\n\r\nI hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the Constitution\r\nthe Union of these States is perpetual. Perpetuity is implied, if not\r\nexpressed, in the fundamental law of all national governments. It is\r\nsafe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its\r\norganic law for its own termination. Continue to execute all the express\r\nprovisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will endure\r\nforever, it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not\r\nprovided for in the instrument itself.\r\n\r\nAgain: If the United States be not a government proper, but an\r\nassociation of States in the nature of contract merely, can it, as a\r\ncontract, be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?\r\nOne party to a contract may violate it--break it, so to speak--but does\r\nit not require all to lawfully rescind it?\r\n\r\nDescending from these general principles, we find the proposition that\r\nin legal contemplation the Union is perpetual confirmed by the history\r\nof the Union itself. The Union is much older than the Constitution. It\r\nwas formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association in 1774. It was\r\nmatured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in 1776. It was\r\nfurther matured, and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly\r\nplighted and engaged that it should be perpetual, by the Articles of\r\nConfederation in 1778. And finally, in 1787, one of the declared objects\r\nfor ordaining and establishing the Constitution was \"to form a more\r\nperfect Union.\"\r\n\r\nBut if destruction of the Union by one or by a part only of the States\r\nbe lawfully possible, the Union is less perfect than before the\r\nConstitution, having lost the vital element of perpetuity.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these views that no State upon its own mere motion can\r\nlawfully get out of the Union; that resolves and ordinances to that\r\neffect are legally void, and that acts of violence within any State or\r\nStates against the authority of the United States are insurrectionary or\r\nrevolutionary, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nI therefore consider that in view of the Constitution and the laws the\r\nUnion is unbroken, and to the extent of my ability, I shall take care,\r\nas the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me, that the laws of\r\nthe Union be faithfully executed in all the States. Doing this I deem to\r\nbe only a simple duty on my part, and I shall perform it so far as\r\npracticable unless my rightful masters, the American people, shall\r\nwithhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the\r\ncontrary. I trust this will not be regarded as a menace, but only as the\r\ndeclared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and\r\nmaintain itself.\r\n\r\nIn doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence, and there\r\nshall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority. The power\r\nconfided to me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess the property\r\nand places belonging to the Government and to collect the duties and\r\nimposts; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects, there will\r\nbe no invasion, no using of force against or among the people anywhere.\r\nWhere hostility to the United States in any interior locality shall be\r\nso great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from\r\nholding the Federal offices, there will be no attempt to force obnoxious\r\nstrangers among the people for that object. While the strict legal right\r\nmay exist in the Government to enforce the exercise of these offices,\r\nthe attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable\r\nwithal that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nThe mails, unless repelled, will continue to be furnished in all parts\r\nof the Union. So far as possible the people everywhere shall have that\r\nsense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and\r\nreflection. The course here indicated will be followed unless current\r\nevents and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper,\r\nand in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised,\r\naccording to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope\r\nof a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of\r\nfraternal sympathies and affections.\r\n\r\nThat there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the\r\nUnion at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it I will neither\r\naffirm nor deny; but if there be such, I need address no word to them.\r\nTo those, however, who really love the Union may I not speak?\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our\r\nnational fabric, with all its benefits, its memories, and its hopes,\r\nwould it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it? Will you\r\nhazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any\r\nportion of the ills you fly from have no real existence? Will you, while\r\nthe certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly\r\nfrom, will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake?\r\n\r\nAll profess to be content in the Union if all constitutional rights can\r\nbe maintained. Is it true, then, that any right plainly written in the\r\nConstitution has been denied? I think not. Happily, the human mind is so\r\nconstituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this.\r\nThink, if you can, of a single instance in which a plainly written\r\nprovision of the Constitution has ever been denied. If by the mere force\r\nof numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written\r\nconstitutional right, it might in a moral point of view justify\r\nrevolution; certainly would if such right were a vital one. But such is\r\nnot our case. All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are\r\nso plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations, guaranties and\r\nprohibitions, in the Constitution that controversies never arise\r\nconcerning them. But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision\r\nspecifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical\r\nadministration. No foresight can anticipate nor any document of\r\nreasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions.\r\nShall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by State\r\nauthority? The Constitution does not expressly say. May Congress\r\nprohibit slavery in the Territories? The Constitution does not expressly\r\nsay. Must Congress protect slavery in the Territories? The Constitution\r\ndoes not expressly say.\r\n\r\nFrom questions of this class spring all our constitutional\r\ncontroversies, and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities.\r\nIf the minority will not acquiesce, the majority must, or the Government\r\nmust cease. There is no other alternative, for continuing the Government\r\nis acquiescence on one side or the other. If a minority in such case\r\nwill secede rather than acquiesce, they make a precedent which in turn\r\nwill divide and ruin them, for a minority of their own will secede from\r\nthem whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. For\r\ninstance, why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two\r\nhence arbitrarily secede again, precisely as portions of the present\r\nUnion now claim to secede from it? All who cherish disunion sentiments\r\nare now being educated to the exact temper of doing this.\r\n\r\nIs there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose\r\na new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession?\r\n\r\nPlainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy. A\r\nmajority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and\r\nalways changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and\r\nsentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people. Whoever rejects\r\nit does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism. Unanimity is\r\nimpossible. The rule of a minority, as a permanent arrangement, is\r\nwholly inadmissible; so that, rejecting the majority principle, anarchy\r\nor despotism in some form is all that is left.\r\n\r\nI do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional\r\nquestions are to be decided by the Supreme Court, nor do I deny that\r\nsuch decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit as\r\nto the object of that suit, while they are also entitled to very high\r\nrespect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments\r\nof the Government. And while it is obviously possible that such decision\r\nmay be erroneous in any given case, still the evil effect following it,\r\nbeing limited to that particular case, with the chance that it may be\r\noverruled and never become a precedent for other cases, can better be\r\nborne than could the evils of a different practice. At the same time,\r\nthe candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government\r\nupon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably\r\nfixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made in\r\nordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will\r\nhave ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically\r\nresigned their Government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. Nor\r\nis there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges. It is a\r\nduty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought\r\nbefore them, and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their\r\ndecisions to political purposes.\r\n\r\nOne section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be\r\nextended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be\r\nextended. This is the only substantial dispute. The fugitive-slave\r\nclause of the Constitution and the law for the suppression of the\r\nforeign slave trade are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can\r\never be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly\r\nsupports the law itself. The great body of the people abide by the dry\r\nlegal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, I\r\nthink, can not be perfectly cured, and it would be worse in both cases\r\nafter the separation of the sections than before. The foreign slave\r\ntrade, now imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without\r\nrestriction in one section, while fugitive slaves, now only partially\r\nsurrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the other.\r\n\r\nPhysically speaking, we can not separate. We can not remove our\r\nrespective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between\r\nthem. A husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and\r\nbeyond the reach of each other, but the different parts of our country\r\ncan not do this. They can not but remain face to face, and intercourse,\r\neither amicable or hostile, must continue between them. Is it possible,\r\nthen, to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory\r\nafter separation than before? Can aliens make treaties easier than\r\nfriends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between\r\naliens than laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you can not\r\nfight always; and when, after much loss on both sides and no gain on\r\neither, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to terms of\r\nintercourse, are again upon you.\r\n\r\nThis country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit\r\nit. Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government, they can\r\nexercise their constitutional right of amending it or their\r\nrevolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it. I can not be ignorant\r\nof the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of\r\nhaving the National Constitution amended. While I make no recommendation\r\nof amendments, I fully recognize the rightful authority of the people\r\nover the whole subject, to be exercised in either of the modes\r\nprescribed in the instrument itself; and I should, under existing\r\ncircumstances, favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being\r\nafforded the people to act upon it. I will venture to add that to me the\r\nconvention mode seems preferable, in that it allows amendments to\r\noriginate with the people themselves, instead of only permitting them to\r\ntake or reject propositions originated by others, not especially chosen\r\nfor the purpose, and which might not be precisely such as they would\r\nwish to either accept or refuse. I understand a proposed amendment to\r\nthe Constitution--which amendment, however, I have not seen--has passed\r\nCongress, to the effect that the Federal Government shall never\r\ninterfere with the domestic institutions of the States, including that\r\nof persons held to service. To avoid misconstruction of what I have\r\nsaid, I depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so\r\nfar as to say that, holding such a provision to now be implied\r\nconstitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and\r\nirrevocable.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Magistrate derives all his authority from the people, and they\r\nhave referred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the\r\nStates. The people themselves can do this if also they choose, but the\r\nExecutive as such has nothing to do with it. His duty is to administer\r\nthe present Government as it came to his hands and to transmit it\r\nunimpaired by him to his successor.\r\n\r\nWhy should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of\r\nthe people? Is there any better or equal hope in the world? In our\r\npresent differences, is either party without faith of being in the\r\nright? If the Almighty Ruler of Nations, with His eternal truth and\r\njustice, be on your side of the North, or on yours of the South, that\r\ntruth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great\r\ntribunal of the American people.\r\n\r\nBy the frame of the Government under which we live this same people have\r\nwisely given their public servants but little power for mischief, and\r\nhave with equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their\r\nown hands at very short intervals. While the people retain their virtue\r\nand vigilance no Administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly\r\ncan very seriously injure the Government in the short space of four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, one and all, think calmly and well upon this whole\r\nsubject. Nothing valuable can be lost by taking time. If there be an\r\nobject to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never\r\ntake deliberately, that object will be frustrated by taking time; but no\r\ngood object can be frustrated by it. Such of you as are now dissatisfied\r\nstill have the old Constitution unimpaired, and, on the sensitive point,\r\nthe laws of your own framing under it; while the new Administration will\r\nhave no immediate power, if it would, to change either. If it were\r\nadmitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the\r\ndispute, there still is no single good reason for precipitate action.\r\nIntelligence, patriotism, Christianity, and a firm reliance on Him who\r\nhas never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust\r\nin the best way all our present difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is\r\nthe momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not assail you.\r\nYou can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors. You\r\nhave no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government, while I\r\nshall have the most solemn one to \"preserve, protect, and defend it.\"\r\n\r\nI am loath to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be\r\nenemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of\r\naffection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every\r\nbattlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all\r\nover this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again\r\ntouched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABRAHAM LINCOLN, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1865\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  Weeks of wet weather preceding Lincoln's second\r\ninauguration had caused Pennsylvania Avenue to become a sea of mud and\r\nstanding water. Thousands of spectators stood in thick mud at the\r\nCapitol grounds to hear the President. As he stood on the East Portico\r\nto take the executive oath, the completed Capitol dome over the\r\nPresident's head was a physical reminder of the resolve of his\r\nAdministration throughout the years of civil war. Chief Justice Salmon\r\nChase administered the oath of office. In little more than a month, the\r\nPresident would be assassinated.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Countrymen:\r\n\r\nAt this second appearing to take the oath of the Presidential office\r\nthere is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the\r\nfirst. Then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued\r\nseemed fitting and proper. Now, at the expiration of four years, during\r\nwhich public declarations have been constantly called forth on every\r\npoint and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention\r\nand engrosses the energies of the nation, little that is new could be\r\npresented. The progress of our arms, upon which all else chiefly\r\ndepends, is as well known to the public as to myself, and it is, I\r\ntrust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all. With high hope\r\nfor the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were\r\nanxiously directed to an impending civil war. All dreaded it, all sought\r\nto avert it. While the inaugural address was being delivered from this\r\nplace, devoted altogether to saving the Union without war, urgent agents\r\nwere in the city seeking to destroy it without war--seeking to dissolve\r\nthe Union and divide effects by negotiation. Both parties deprecated\r\nwar, but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive,\r\nand the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nOne-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves, not distributed\r\ngenerally over the Union, but localized in the southern part of it.\r\nThese slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest. All knew that\r\nthis interest was somehow the cause of the war. To strengthen,\r\nperpetuate, and extend this interest was the object for which the\r\ninsurgents would rend the Union even by war, while the Government\r\nclaimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement\r\nof it. Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration\r\nwhich it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the\r\nconflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should\r\ncease. Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental\r\nand astounding. Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and\r\neach invokes His aid against the other. It may seem strange that any men\r\nshould dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from\r\nthe sweat of other men's faces, but let us judge not, that we be not\r\njudged. The prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has\r\nbeen answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. \"Woe unto the\r\nworld because of offenses; for it must needs be that offenses come, but\r\nwoe to that man by whom the offense cometh.\" If we shall suppose that\r\nAmerican slavery is one of those offenses which, in the providence of\r\nGod, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed\r\ntime, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South\r\nthis terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came,\r\nshall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes\r\nwhich the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we\r\nhope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily\r\npass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled\r\nby the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall\r\nbe sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid\r\nby another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago,\r\nso still it must be said \"the judgments of the Lord are true and\r\nrighteous altogether.\" With malice toward none, with charity for all,\r\nwith firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us\r\nstrive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds,\r\nto care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and\r\nhis orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting\r\npeace among ourselves and with all nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nULYSSES S. GRANT, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1869\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  General Grant was the first of many Civil War\r\nofficers to become President of the United States. He refused to ride in\r\nthe carriage to the Capitol with President Johnson, who then decided not\r\nto attend the ceremony. The oath of office was administered by Chief\r\nJustice Salmon Chase on the East Portico. The inaugural parade boasted\r\neight full divisions of the Army--the largest contingent yet to march on\r\nsuch an occasion. That evening, a ball was held in the Treasury\r\nBuilding.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens of the United States:\r\n\r\nYour suffrages having elected me to the office of President of the\r\nUnited States, I have, in conformity to the Constitution of our country,\r\ntaken the oath of office prescribed therein. I have taken this oath\r\nwithout mental reservation and with the determination to do to the best\r\nof my ability all that is required of me. The responsibilities of the\r\nposition I feel, but accept them without fear. The office has come to me\r\nunsought; I commence its duties untrammeled. I bring to it a conscious\r\ndesire and determination to fill it to the best of my ability to the\r\nsatisfaction of the people.\r\n\r\nOn all leading questions agitating the public mind I will always express\r\nmy views to Congress and urge them according to my judgment, and when I\r\nthink it advisable will exercise the constitutional privilege of\r\ninterposing a veto to defeat measures which I oppose; but all laws will\r\nbe faithfully executed, whether they meet my approval or not.\r\n\r\nI shall on all subjects have a policy to recommend, but none to enforce\r\nagainst the will of the people. Laws are to govern all alike--those\r\nopposed as well as those who favor them. I know no method to secure the\r\nrepeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nThe country having just emerged from a great rebellion, many questions\r\nwill come before it for settlement in the next four years which\r\npreceding Administrations have never had to deal with. In meeting these\r\nit is desirable that they should be approached calmly, without\r\nprejudice, hate, or sectional pride, remembering that the greatest good\r\nto the greatest number is the object to be attained.\r\n\r\nThis requires security of person, property, and free religious and\r\npolitical opinion in every part of our common country, without regard to\r\nlocal prejudice. All laws to secure these ends will receive my best\r\nefforts for their enforcement.\r\n\r\nA great debt has been contracted in securing to us and our posterity the\r\nUnion. The payment of this, principal and interest, as well as the\r\nreturn to a specie basis as soon as it can be accomplished without\r\nmaterial detriment to the debtor class or to the country at large, must\r\nbe provided for. To protect the national honor, every dollar of\r\nGovernment indebtedness should be paid in gold, unless otherwise\r\nexpressly stipulated in the contract. Let it be understood that no\r\nrepudiator of one farthing of our public debt will be trusted in public\r\nplace, and it will go far toward strengthening a credit which ought to\r\nbe the best in the world, and will ultimately enable us to replace the\r\ndebt with bonds bearing less interest than we now pay. To this should be\r\nadded a faithful collection of the revenue, a strict accountability to\r\nthe Treasury for every dollar collected, and the greatest practicable\r\nretrenchment in expenditure in every department of Government.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the paying capacity of the country now, with the ten\r\nStates in poverty from the effects of war, but soon to emerge, I trust,\r\ninto greater prosperity than ever before, with its paying capacity\r\ntwenty-five years ago, and calculate what it probably will be\r\ntwenty-five years hence, who can doubt the feasibility of paying every\r\ndollar then with more ease than we now pay for useless luxuries? Why, it\r\nlooks as though Providence had bestowed upon us a strong box in the\r\nprecious metals locked up in the sterile mountains of the far West, and\r\nwhich we are now forging the key to unlock, to meet the very contingency\r\nthat is now upon us.\r\n\r\nUltimately it may be necessary to insure the facilities to reach these\r\nriches and it may be necessary also that the General Government should\r\ngive its aid to secure this access; but that should only be when a\r\ndollar of obligation to pay secures precisely the same sort of dollar to\r\nuse now, and not before. Whilst the question of specie payments is in\r\nabeyance the prudent business man is careful about contracting debts\r\npayable in the distant future. The nation should follow the same rule. A\r\nprostrate commerce is to be rebuilt and all industries encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe young men of the country--those who from their age must be its\r\nrulers twenty-five years hence--have a peculiar interest in maintaining\r\nthe national honor. A moment's reflection as to what will be our\r\ncommanding influence among the nations of the earth in their day, if\r\nthey are only true to themselves, should inspire them with national\r\npride. All divisions--geographical, political, and religious--can join\r\nin this common sentiment. How the public debt is to be paid or specie\r\npayments resumed is not so important as that a plan should be adopted\r\nand acquiesced in. A united determination to do is worth more than\r\ndivided counsels upon the method of doing. Legislation upon this subject\r\nmay not be necessary now, or even advisable, but it will be when the\r\ncivil law is more fully restored in all parts of the country and trade\r\nresumes its wonted channels.\r\n\r\nIt will be my endeavor to execute all laws in good faith, to collect all\r\nrevenues assessed, and to have them properly accounted for and\r\neconomically disbursed. I will to the best of my ability appoint to\r\noffice those only who will carry out this design.\r\n\r\nIn regard to foreign policy, I would deal with nations as equitable law\r\nrequires individuals to deal with each other, and I would protect the\r\nlaw-abiding citizen, whether of native or foreign birth, wherever his\r\nrights are jeopardized or the flag of our country floats. I would\r\nrespect the rights of all nations, demanding equal respect for our own.\r\nIf others depart from this rule in their dealings with us, we may be\r\ncompelled to follow their precedent.\r\n\r\nThe proper treatment of the original occupants of this land--the Indians\r\none deserving of careful study. I will favor any course toward them\r\nwhich tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe question of suffrage is one which is likely to agitate the public so\r\nlong as a portion of the citizens of the nation are excluded from its\r\nprivileges in any State. It seems to me very desirable that this\r\nquestion should be settled now, and I entertain the hope and express the\r\ndesire that it may be by the ratification of the fifteenth article of\r\namendment to the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I ask patient forbearance one toward another throughout\r\nthe land, and a determined effort on the part of every citizen to do his\r\nshare toward cementing a happy union; and I ask the prayers of the\r\nnation to Almighty God in behalf of this consummation.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nULYSSES S. GRANT, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, MARCH 4, 1873\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  Frigid temperatures caused many of the events\r\nplanned for the second inauguration to be abandoned. The thermometer did\r\nnot rise much above zero all day, persuading many to avoid the ceremony\r\non the East Portico of the Capitol. The oath of office was administered\r\nby Chief Justice Salmon Chase. A parade and a display of fireworks were\r\nfeatured later that day, as well as a ball in a temporary wooden\r\nstructure on Judiciary Square. The wind blew continuously through the\r\nballroom and many of the guests at the ball never removed their coats.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nUnder Providence I have been called a second time to act as Executive\r\nover this great nation. It has been my endeavor in the past to maintain\r\nall the laws, and, so far as lay in my power, to act for the best\r\ninterests of the whole people. My best efforts will be given in the same\r\ndirection in the future, aided, I trust, by my four years' experience in\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\nWhen my first term of the office of Chief Executive began, the country\r\nhad not recovered from the effects of a great internal revolution, and\r\nthree of the former States of the Union had not been restored to their\r\nFederal relations.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me wise that no new questions should be raised so long as\r\nthat condition of affairs existed. Therefore the past four years, so far\r\nas I could control events, have been consumed in the effort to restore\r\nharmony, public credit, commerce, and all the arts of peace and\r\nprogress. It is my firm conviction that the civilized world is tending\r\ntoward republicanism, or government by the people through their chosen\r\nrepresentatives, and that our own great Republic is destined to be the\r\nguiding star to all others.\r\n\r\nUnder our Republic we support an army less than that of any European\r\npower of any standing and a navy less than that of either of at least\r\nfive of them. There could be no extension of territory on the continent\r\nwhich would call for an increase of this force, but rather might such\r\nextension enable us to diminish it.\r\n\r\nThe theory of government changes with general progress. Now that the\r\ntelegraph is made available for communicating thought, together with\r\nrapid transit by steam, all parts of a continent are made contiguous for\r\nall purposes of government, and communication between the extreme limits\r\nof the country made easier than it was throughout the old thirteen\r\nStates at the beginning of our national existence.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the late civil strife have been to free the slave and\r\nmake him a citizen. Yet he is not possessed of the civil rights which\r\ncitizenship should carry with it. This is wrong, and should be\r\ncorrected. To this correction I stand committed, so far as Executive\r\ninfluence can avail.\r\n\r\nSocial equality is not a subject to be legislated upon, nor shall I ask\r\nthat anything be done to advance the social status of the colored man,\r\nexcept to give him a fair chance to develop what there is good in him,\r\ngive him access to the schools, and when he travels let him feel assured\r\nthat his conduct will regulate the treatment and fare he will receive.\r\n\r\nThe States lately at war with the General Government are now happily\r\nrehabilitated, and no Executive control is exercised in any one of them\r\nthat would not be exercised in any other State under like circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of the past Administration the proposition came up for\r\nthe admission of Santo Domingo as a Territory of the Union. It was not a\r\nquestion of my seeking, but was a proposition from the people of Santo\r\nDomingo, and which I entertained. I believe now, as I did then, that it\r\nwas for the best interest of this country, for the people of Santo\r\nDomingo, and all concerned that the proposition should be received\r\nfavorably. It was, however, rejected constitutionally, and therefore the\r\nsubject was never brought up again by me.\r\n\r\nIn future, while I hold my present office, the subject of acquisition of\r\nterritory must have the support of the people before I will recommend\r\nany proposition looking to such acquisition. I say here, however, that I\r\ndo not share in the apprehension held by many as to the danger of\r\ngovernments becoming weakened and destroyed by reason of their extension\r\nof territory. Commerce, education, and rapid transit of thought and\r\nmatter by telegraph and steam have changed all this. Rather do I believe\r\nthat our Great Maker is preparing the world, in His own good time, to\r\nbecome one nation, speaking one language, and when armies and navies\r\nwill be no longer required.\r\n\r\nMy efforts in the future will be directed to the restoration of good\r\nfeeling between the different sections of our common country; to the\r\nrestoration of our currency to a fixed value as compared with the\r\nworld's standard of values--gold--and, if possible, to a par with it; to\r\nthe construction of cheap routes of transit throughout the land, to the\r\nend that the products of all may find a market and leave a living\r\nremuneration to the producer; to the maintenance of friendly relations\r\nwith all our neighbors and with distant nations; to the reestablishment\r\nof our commerce and share in the carrying trade upon the ocean; to the\r\nencouragement of such manufacturing industries as can be economically\r\npursued in this country, to the end that the exports of home products\r\nand industries may pay for our imports--the only sure method of\r\nreturning to and permanently maintaining a specie basis; to the\r\nelevation of labor; and, by a humane course, to bring the aborigines of\r\nthe country under the benign influences of education and civilization.\r\nIt is either this or war of extermination: Wars of extermination,\r\nengaged in by people pursuing commerce and all industrial pursuits, are\r\nexpensive even against the weakest people, and are demoralizing and\r\nwicked. Our superiority of strength and advantages of civilization\r\nshould make us lenient toward the Indian. The wrong inflicted upon him\r\nshould be taken into account and the balance placed to his credit. The\r\nmoral view of the question should be considered and the question asked,\r\nCan not the Indian be made a useful and productive member of society by\r\nproper teaching and treatment? If the effort is made in good faith, we\r\nwill stand better before the civilized nations of the earth and in our\r\nown consciences for having made it.\r\n\r\nAll these things are not to be accomplished by one individual, but they\r\nwill receive my support and such recommendations to Congress as will in\r\nmy judgment best serve to carry them into effect. I beg your support and\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nIt has been, and is, my earnest desire to correct abuses that have grown\r\nup in the civil service of the country. To secure this reformation rules\r\nregulating methods of appointment and promotions were established and\r\nhave been tried. My efforts for such reformation shall be continued to\r\nthe best of my judgment. The spirit of the rules adopted will be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge before this assemblage, representing, as it does, every\r\nsection of our country, the obligation I am under to my countrymen for\r\nthe great honor they have conferred on me by returning me to the highest\r\noffice within their gift, and the further obligation resting on me to\r\nrender to them the best services within my power. This I promise,\r\nlooking forward with the greatest anxiety to the day when I shall be\r\nreleased from responsibilities that at times are almost overwhelming,\r\nand from which I have scarcely had a respite since the eventful firing\r\nupon Fort Sumter, in April, 1861, to the present day. My services were\r\nthen tendered and accepted under the first call for troops growing out\r\nof that event.\r\n\r\nI did not ask for place or position, and was entirely without influence\r\nor the acquaintance of persons of influence, but was resolved to perform\r\nmy part in a struggle threatening the very existence of the nation. I\r\nperformed a conscientious duty, without asking promotion or command, and\r\nwithout a revengeful feeling toward any section or individual.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, throughout the war, and from my candidacy for my\r\npresent office in 1868 to the close of the last Presidential campaign, I\r\nhave been the subject of abuse and slander scarcely ever equaled in\r\npolitical history, which to-day I feel that I can afford to disregard in\r\nview of your verdict, which I gratefully accept as my vindication.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUTHERFORD B. HAYES, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MARCH 5, 1877\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The outcome of the election of 1876 was not known\r\nuntil the week before the inauguration itself. Democrat Samuel Tilden\r\nhad won the greater number of popular votes and lacked only one\r\nelectoral vote to claim a majority in the electoral college. Twenty\r\ndisputed electoral votes, however, kept hopes alive for Republican\r\nGovernor Hayes of Ohio. A fifteen-member Electoral Commission was\r\nappointed by the Congress to deliberate the outcome of the election. By\r\na majority vote of 8 to 7 the Commission gave all of the disputed votes\r\nto the Republican candidate, and Mr. Hayes was elected President on\r\nMarch 2. Since March 4 was a Sunday, he took the oath of office in the\r\nRed Room at the White House on March 3, and again on Monday on the East\r\nPortico of the Capitol. Chief Justice Morrison Waite administered both\r\noaths.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nWe have assembled to repeat the public ceremonial, begun by Washington,\r\nobserved by all my predecessors, and now a time-honored custom, which\r\nmarks the commencement of a new term of the Presidential office. Called\r\nto the duties of this great trust, I proceed, in compliance with usage,\r\nto announce some of the leading principles, on the subjects that now\r\nchiefly engage the public attention, by which it is my desire to be\r\nguided in the discharge of those duties. I shall not undertake to lay\r\ndown irrevocably principles or measures of administration, but rather to\r\nspeak of the motives which should animate us, and to suggest certain\r\nimportant ends to be attained in accordance with our institutions and\r\nessential to the welfare of our country.\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the discussions which preceded the recent Presidential\r\nelection it seemed to me fitting that I should fully make known my\r\nsentiments in regard to several of the important questions which then\r\nappeared to demand the consideration of the country. Following the\r\nexample, and in part adopting the language, of one of my predecessors, I\r\nwish now, when every motive for misrepresentation has passed away, to\r\nrepeat what was said before the election, trusting that my countrymen\r\nwill candidly weigh and understand it, and that they will feel assured\r\nthat the sentiments declared in accepting the nomination for the\r\nPresidency will be the standard of my conduct in the path before me,\r\ncharged, as I now am, with the grave and difficult task of carrying them\r\nout in the practical administration of the Government so far as depends,\r\nunder the Constitution and laws on the Chief Executive of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe permanent pacification of the country upon such principles and by\r\nsuch measures as will secure the complete protection of all its citizens\r\nin the free enjoyment of all their constitutional rights is now the one\r\nsubject in our public affairs which all thoughtful and patriotic\r\ncitizens regard as of supreme importance.\r\n\r\nMany of the calamitous efforts of the tremendous revolution which has\r\npassed over the Southern States still remain. The immeasurable benefits\r\nwhich will surely follow, sooner or later, the hearty and generous\r\nacceptance of the legitimate results of that revolution have not yet\r\nbeen realized. Difficult and embarrassing questions meet us at the\r\nthreshold of this subject. The people of those States are still\r\nimpoverished, and the inestimable blessing of wise, honest, and peaceful\r\nlocal self-government is not fully enjoyed. Whatever difference of\r\nopinion may exist as to the cause of this condition of things, the fact\r\nis clear that in the progress of events the time has come when such\r\ngovernment is the imperative necessity required by all the varied\r\ninterests, public and private, of those States. But it must not be\r\nforgotten that only a local government which recognizes and maintains\r\ninviolate the rights of all is a true self-government.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the two distinct races whose peculiar relations to each\r\nother have brought upon us the deplorable complications and perplexities\r\nwhich exist in those States, it must be a government which guards the\r\ninterests of both races carefully and equally. It must be a government\r\nwhich submits loyally and heartily to the Constitution and the laws--the\r\nlaws of the nation and the laws of the States themselves--accepting and\r\nobeying faithfully the whole Constitution as it is.\r\n\r\nResting upon this sure and substantial foundation, the superstructure of\r\nbeneficent local governments can be built up, and not otherwise. In\r\nfurtherance of such obedience to the letter and the spirit of the\r\nConstitution, and in behalf of all that its attainment implies, all\r\nso-called party interests lose their apparent importance, and party\r\nlines may well be permitted to fade into insignificance. The question we\r\nhave to consider for the immediate welfare of those States of the Union\r\nis the question of government or no government; of social order and all\r\nthe peaceful industries and the happiness that belongs to it, or a\r\nreturn to barbarism. It is a question in which every citizen of the\r\nnation is deeply interested, and with respect to which we ought not to\r\nbe, in a partisan sense, either Republicans or Democrats, but\r\nfellow-citizens and fellowmen, to whom the interests of a common\r\ncountry and a common humanity are dear.\r\n\r\nThe sweeping revolution of the entire labor system of a large portion of\r\nour country and the advance of 4,000,000 people from a condition of\r\nservitude to that of citizenship, upon an equal footing with their\r\nformer masters, could not occur without presenting problems of the\r\ngravest moment, to be dealt with by the emancipated race, by their\r\nformer masters, and by the General Government, the author of the act of\r\nemancipation. That it was a wise, just, and providential act, fraught\r\nwith good for all concerned, is not generally conceded throughout the\r\ncountry. That a moral obligation rests upon the National Government to\r\nemploy its constitutional power and influence to establish the rights of\r\nthe people it has emancipated, and to protect them in the enjoyment of\r\nthose rights when they are infringed or assailed, is also generally\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nThe evils which afflict the Southern States can only be removed or\r\nremedied by the united and harmonious efforts of both races, actuated by\r\nmotives of mutual sympathy and regard; and while in duty bound and fully\r\ndetermined to protect the rights of all by every constitutional means at\r\nthe disposal of my Administration, I am sincerely anxious to use every\r\nlegitimate influence in favor of honest and efficient local\r\nself-government as the true resource of those States for the promotion\r\nof the contentment and prosperity of their citizens. In the effort I\r\nshall make to accomplish this purpose I ask the cordial cooperation of\r\nall who cherish an interest in the welfare of the country, trusting that\r\nparty ties and the prejudice of race will be freely surrendered in\r\nbehalf of the great purpose to be accomplished. In the important work of\r\nrestoring the South it is not the political situation alone that merits\r\nattention. The material development of that section of the country has\r\nbeen arrested by the social and political revolution through which it\r\nhas passed, and now needs and deserves the considerate care of the\r\nNational Government within the just limits prescribed by the\r\nConstitution and wise public economy.\r\n\r\nBut at the basis of all prosperity, for that as well as for every other\r\npart of the country, lies the improvement of the intellectual and moral\r\ncondition of the people. Universal suffrage should rest upon universal\r\neducation. To this end, liberal and permanent provision should be made\r\nfor the support of free schools by the State governments, and, if need\r\nbe, supplemented by legitimate aid from national authority.\r\n\r\nLet me assure my countrymen of the Southern States that it is my earnest\r\ndesire to regard and promote their truest interest--the interests of the\r\nwhite and of the colored people both and equally--and to put forth my\r\nbest efforts in behalf of a civil policy which will forever wipe out in\r\nour political affairs the color line and the distinction between North\r\nand South, to the end that we may have not merely a united North or a\r\nunited South, but a united country.\r\n\r\nI ask the attention of the public to the paramount necessity of reform\r\nin our civil service--a reform not merely as to certain abuses and\r\npractices of so-called official patronage which have come to have the\r\nsanction of usage in the several Departments of our Government, but a\r\nchange in the system of appointment itself; a reform that shall be\r\nthorough, radical, and complete; a return to the principles and\r\npractices of the founders of the Government. They neither expected nor\r\ndesired from public officers any partisan service. They meant that\r\npublic officers should owe their whole service to the Government and to\r\nthe people. They meant that the officer should be secure in his tenure\r\nas long as his personal character remained untarnished and the\r\nperformance of his duties satisfactory. They held that appointments to\r\noffice were not to be made nor expected merely as rewards for partisan\r\nservices, nor merely on the nomination of members of Congress, as being\r\nentitled in any respect to the control of such appointments.\r\n\r\nThe fact that both the great political parties of the country, in\r\ndeclaring their principles prior to the election, gave a prominent place\r\nto the subject of reform of our civil service, recognizing and strongly\r\nurging its necessity, in terms almost identical in their specific import\r\nwith those I have here employed, must be accepted as a conclusive\r\nargument in behalf of these measures. It must be regarded as the\r\nexpression of the united voice and will of the whole country upon this\r\nsubject, and both political parties are virtually pledged to give it\r\ntheir unreserved support.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States of necessity owes his election to\r\noffice to the suffrage and zealous labors of a political party, the\r\nmembers of which cherish with ardor and regard as of essential\r\nimportance the principles of their party organization; but he should\r\nstrive to be always mindful of the fact that he serves his party best\r\nwho serves the country best.\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of the reform we seek, and in other important respects a\r\nchange of great importance, I recommend an amendment to the Constitution\r\nprescribing a term of six years for the Presidential office and\r\nforbidding a reelection.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the financial condition of the country, I shall not\r\nattempt an extended history of the embarrassment and prostration which\r\nwe have suffered during the past three years. The depression in all our\r\nvaried commercial and manufacturing interests throughout the country,\r\nwhich began in September, 1873, still continues. It is very gratifying,\r\nhowever, to be able to say that there are indications all around us of a\r\ncoming change to prosperous times.\r\n\r\nUpon the currency question, intimately connected, as it is, with this\r\ntopic, I may be permitted to repeat here the statement made in my letter\r\nof acceptance, that in my judgment the feeling of uncertainty\r\ninseparable from an irredeemable paper currency, with its fluctuation of\r\nvalues, is one of the greatest obstacles to a return to prosperous\r\ntimes. The only safe paper currency is one which rests upon a coin basis\r\nand is at all times and promptly convertible into coin.\r\n\r\nI adhere to the views heretofore expressed by me in favor of\r\nCongressional legislation in behalf of an early resumption of specie\r\npayments, and I am satisfied not only that this is wise, but that the\r\ninterests, as well as the public sentiment, of the country imperatively\r\ndemand it.\r\n\r\nPassing from these remarks upon the condition of our own country to\r\nconsider our relations with other lands, we are reminded by the\r\ninternational complications abroad, threatening the peace of Europe,\r\nthat our traditional rule of noninterference in the affairs of foreign\r\nnations has proved of great value in past times and ought to be strictly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe policy inaugurated by my honored predecessor, President Grant, of\r\nsubmitting to arbitration grave questions in dispute between ourselves\r\nand foreign powers points to a new, and incomparably the best,\r\ninstrumentality for the preservation of peace, and will, as I believe,\r\nbecome a beneficent example of the course to be pursued in similar\r\nemergencies by other nations.\r\n\r\nIf, unhappily, questions of difference should at any time during the\r\nperiod of my Administration arise between the United States and any\r\nforeign government, it will certainly be my disposition and my hope to\r\naid in their settlement in the same peaceful and honorable way, thus\r\nsecuring to our country the great blessings of peace and mutual good\r\noffices with all the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, we have reached the close of a political contest marked\r\nby the excitement which usually attends the contests between great\r\npolitical parties whose members espouse and advocate with earnest faith\r\ntheir respective creeds. The circumstances were, perhaps, in no respect\r\nextraordinary save in the closeness and the consequent uncertainty of\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the history of the country it has been deemed\r\nbest, in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case, that the\r\nobjections and questions in dispute with reference to the counting of\r\nthe electoral votes should be referred to the decision of a tribunal\r\nappointed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThat tribunal--established by law for this sole purpose; its members,\r\nall of them, men of long-established reputation for integrity and\r\nintelligence, and, with the exception of those who are also members of\r\nthe supreme judiciary, chosen equally from both political parties; its\r\ndeliberations enlightened by the research and the arguments of able\r\ncounsel--was entitled to the fullest confidence of the American people.\r\nIts decisions have been patiently waited for, and accepted as legally\r\nconclusive by the general judgment of the public. For the present,\r\nopinion will widely vary as to the wisdom of the several conclusions\r\nannounced by that tribunal. This is to be anticipated in every instance\r\nwhere matters of dispute are made the subject of arbitration under the\r\nforms of law. Human judgment is never unerring, and is rarely regarded\r\nas otherwise than wrong by the unsuccessful party in the contest.\r\n\r\nThe fact that two great political parties have in this way settled a\r\ndispute in regard to which good men differ as to the facts and the law\r\nno less than as to the proper course to be pursued in solving the\r\nquestion in controversy is an occasion for general rejoicing.\r\n\r\nUpon one point there is entire unanimity in public sentiment--that\r\nconflicting claims to the Presidency must be amicably and peaceably\r\nadjusted, and that when so adjusted the general acquiescence of the\r\nnation ought surely to follow.\r\n\r\nIt has been reserved for a government of the people, where the right of\r\nsuffrage is universal, to give to the world the first example in history\r\nof a great nation, in the midst of the struggle of opposing parties for\r\npower, hushing its party tumults to yield the issue of the contest to\r\nadjustment according to the forms of law.\r\n\r\nLooking for the guidance of that Divine Hand by which the destinies of\r\nnations and individuals are shaped, I call upon you, Senators,\r\nRepresentatives, judges, fellow-citizens, here and everywhere, to unite\r\nwith me in an earnest effort to secure to our country the blessings, not\r\nonly of material prosperity, but of justice, peace, and union--a union\r\ndepending not upon the constraint of force, but upon the loving devotion\r\nof a free people; \"and that all things may be so ordered and settled\r\nupon the best and surest foundations that peace and happiness, truth and\r\njustice, religion and piety, may be established among us for all\r\ngenerations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES A. GARFIELD INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, MARCH 4, 1881\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  Snow on the ground discouraged many spectators from\r\nattending the ceremony at the Capitol. Congressman Garfield had been\r\nnominated on his party's 36th ballot at the convention; and he had won\r\nthe popular vote by a slim margin. The former Civil War general was\r\nadministered the oath of office by Chief Justice Morrison Waite on the\r\nsnow-covered East Portico of the Capitol. In the parade and the\r\ninaugural ball later that day, John Philip Sousa led the Marine Corps\r\nband. The ball was held at the Smithsonian Institution's new National\r\nMuseum (now the Arts and Industries Building).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nWe stand to-day upon an eminence which overlooks a hundred years of\r\nnational life--a century crowded with perils, but crowned with the\r\ntriumphs of liberty and law. Before continuing the onward march let us\r\npause on this height for a moment to strengthen our faith and renew our\r\nhope by a glance at the pathway along which our people have traveled.\r\n\r\nIt is now three days more than a hundred years since the adoption of the\r\nfirst written constitution of the United States--the Articles of\r\nConfederation and Perpetual Union. The new Republic was then beset with\r\ndanger on every hand. It had not conquered a place in the family of\r\nnations. The decisive battle of the war for independence, whose\r\ncentennial anniversary will soon be gratefully celebrated at Yorktown,\r\nhad not yet been fought. The colonists were struggling not only against\r\nthe armies of a great nation, but against the settled opinions of\r\nmankind; for the world did not then believe that the supreme authority\r\nof government could be safely intrusted to the guardianship of the\r\npeople themselves.\r\n\r\nWe can not overestimate the fervent love of liberty, the intelligent\r\ncourage, and the sum of common sense with which our fathers made the\r\ngreat experiment of self-government. When they found, after a short\r\ntrial, that the confederacy of States, was too weak to meet the\r\nnecessities of a vigorous and expanding republic, they boldly set it\r\naside, and in its stead established a National Union, founded directly\r\nupon the will of the people, endowed with full power of\r\nself-preservation and ample authority for the accomplishment of its\r\ngreat object.\r\n\r\nUnder this Constitution the boundaries of freedom have been enlarged,\r\nthe foundations of order and peace have been strengthened, and the\r\ngrowth of our people in all the better elements of national life has\r\nindicated the wisdom of the founders and given new hope to their\r\ndescendants. Under this Constitution our people long ago made themselves\r\nsafe against danger from without and secured for their mariners and flag\r\nequality of rights on all the seas. Under this Constitution twenty-five\r\nStates have been added to the Union, with constitutions and laws, framed\r\nand enforced by their own citizens, to secure the manifold blessings of\r\nlocal self-government.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdiction of this Constitution now covers an area fifty times\r\ngreater than that of the original thirteen States and a population\r\ntwenty times greater than that of 1780.\r\n\r\nThe supreme trial of the Constitution came at last under the tremendous\r\npressure of civil war. We ourselves are witnesses that the Union emerged\r\nfrom the blood and fire of that conflict purified and made stronger for\r\nall the beneficent purposes of good government.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at the close of this first century of growth, with the\r\ninspirations of its history in their hearts, our people have lately\r\nreviewed the condition of the nation, passed judgment upon the conduct\r\nand opinions of political parties, and have registered their will\r\nconcerning the future administration of the Government. To interpret and\r\nto execute that will in accordance with the Constitution is the\r\nparamount duty of the Executive.\r\n\r\nEven from this brief review it is manifest that the nation is resolutely\r\nfacing to the front, resolved to employ its best energies in developing\r\nthe great possibilities of the future. Sacredly preserving whatever has\r\nbeen gained to liberty and good government during the century, our\r\npeople are determined to leave behind them all those bitter\r\ncontroversies concerning things which have been irrevocably settled, and\r\nthe further discussion of which can only stir up strife and delay the\r\nonward march.\r\n\r\nThe supremacy of the nation and its laws should be no longer a subject\r\nof debate. That discussion, which for half a century threatened the\r\nexistence of the Union, was closed at last in the high court of war by a\r\ndecree from which there is no appeal--that the Constitution and the laws\r\nmade in pursuance thereof are and shall continue to be the supreme law\r\nof the land, binding alike upon the States and the people. This decree\r\ndoes not disturb the autonomy of the States nor interfere with any of\r\ntheir necessary rights of local self-government, but it does fix and\r\nestablish the permanent supremacy of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe will of the nation, speaking with the voice of battle and through\r\nthe amended Constitution, has fulfilled the great promise of 1776 by\r\nproclaiming \"liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants\r\nthereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of\r\ncitizenship is the most important political change we have known since\r\nthe adoption of the Constitution of 1787. NO thoughtful man can fail to\r\nappreciate its beneficent effect upon our institutions and people. It\r\nhas freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution. It has\r\nadded immensely to the moral and industrial forces of our people. It has\r\nliberated the master as well as the slave from a relation which wronged\r\nand enfeebled both. It has surrendered to their own guardianship the\r\nmanhood of more than 5,000,000 people, and has opened to each one of\r\nthem a career of freedom and usefulness. It has given new inspiration to\r\nthe power of self-help in both races by making labor more honorable to\r\nthe one and more necessary to the other. The influence of this force\r\nwill grow greater and bear richer fruit with the coming years.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this great change has caused serious disturbance to our\r\nSouthern communities. This is to be deplored, though it was perhaps\r\nunavoidable. But those who resisted the change should remember that\r\nunder our institutions there was no middle ground for the negro race\r\nbetween slavery and equal citizenship. There can be no permanent\r\ndisfranchised peasantry in the United States. Freedom can never yield\r\nits fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration\r\nplaces the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen.\r\n\r\nThe emancipated race has already made remarkable progress. With\r\nunquestioning devotion to the Union, with a patience and gentleness not\r\nborn of fear, they have \"followed the light as God gave them to see the\r\nlight.\" They are rapidly laying the material foundations of\r\nself-support, widening their circle of intelligence, and beginning to\r\nenjoy the blessings that gather around the homes of the industrious\r\npoor. They deserve the generous encouragement of all good men. So far as\r\nmy authority can lawfully extend they shall enjoy the full and equal\r\nprotection of the Constitution and the laws.\r\n\r\nThe free enjoyment of equal suffrage is still in question, and a frank\r\nstatement of the issue may aid its solution. It is alleged that in many\r\ncommunities negro citizens are practically denied the freedom of the\r\nballot. In so far as the truth of this allegation is admitted, it is\r\nanswered that in many places honest local government is impossible if\r\nthe mass of uneducated negroes are allowed to vote. These are grave\r\nallegations. So far as the latter is true, it is the only palliation\r\nthat can be offered for opposing the freedom of the ballot. Bad local\r\ngovernment is certainly a great evil, which ought to be prevented; but\r\nto violate the freedom and sanctities of the suffrage is more than an\r\nevil. It is a crime which, if persisted in, will destroy the Government\r\nitself. Suicide is not a remedy. If in other lands it be high treason to\r\ncompass the death of the king, it shall be counted no less a crime here\r\nto strangle our sovereign power and stifle its voice.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that unsettled questions have no pity for the repose of\r\nnations. It should be said with the utmost emphasis that this question\r\nof the suffrage will never give repose or safety to the States or to the\r\nnation until each, within its own jurisdiction, makes and keeps the\r\nballot free and pure by the strong sanctions of the law.\r\n\r\nBut the danger which arises from ignorance in the voter can not be\r\ndenied. It covers a field far wider than that of negro suffrage and the\r\npresent condition of the race. It is a danger that lurks and hides in\r\nthe sources and fountains of power in every state. We have no standard\r\nby which to measure the disaster that may be brought upon us by\r\nignorance and vice in the citizens when joined to corruption and fraud\r\nin the suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe voters of the Union, who make and unmake constitutions, and upon\r\nwhose will hang the destinies of our governments, can transmit their\r\nsupreme authority to no successors save the coming generation of voters,\r\nwho are the sole heirs of sovereign power. If that generation comes to\r\nits inheritance blinded by ignorance and corrupted by vice, the fall of\r\nthe Republic will be certain and remediless.\r\n\r\nThe census has already sounded the alarm in the appalling figures which\r\nmark how dangerously high the tide of illiteracy has risen among our\r\nvoters and their children.\r\n\r\nTo the South this question is of supreme importance. But the\r\nresponsibility for the existence of slavery did not rest upon the South\r\nalone. The nation itself is responsible for the extension of the\r\nsuffrage, and is under special obligations to aid in removing the\r\nilliteracy which it has added to the voting population. For the North\r\nand South alike there is but one remedy. All the constitutional power of\r\nthe nation and of the States and all the volunteer forces of the people\r\nshould be surrendered to meet this danger by the savory influence of\r\nuniversal education.\r\n\r\nIt is the high privilege and sacred duty of those now living to educate\r\ntheir successors and fit them, by intelligence and virtue, for the\r\ninheritance which awaits them.\r\n\r\nIn this beneficent work sections and races should be forgotten and\r\npartisanship should be unknown. Let our people find a new meaning in the\r\ndivine oracle which declares that \"a little child shall lead them,\" for\r\nour own little children will soon control the destinies of the Republic.\r\n\r\nMy countrymen, we do not now differ in our judgment concerning the\r\ncontroversies of past generations, and fifty years hence our children\r\nwill not be divided in their opinions concerning our controversies. They\r\nwill surely bless their fathers and their fathers' God that the Union\r\nwas preserved, that slavery was overthrown, and that both races were\r\nmade equal before the law. We may hasten or we may retard, but we can\r\nnot prevent, the final reconciliation. Is it not possible for us now to\r\nmake a truce with time by anticipating and accepting its inevitable\r\nverdict?\r\n\r\nEnterprises of the highest importance to our moral and material\r\nwell-being unite us and offer ample employment of our best powers. Let\r\nall our people, leaving behind them the battlefields of dead issues,\r\nmove forward and in their strength of liberty and the restored Union win\r\nthe grander victories of peace.\r\n\r\nThe prosperity which now prevails is without parallel in our history.\r\nFruitful seasons have done much to secure it, but they have not done\r\nall. The preservation of the public credit and the resumption of specie\r\npayments, so successfully attained by the Administration of my\r\npredecessors, have enabled our people to secure the blessings which the\r\nseasons brought.\r\n\r\nBy the experience of commercial nations in all ages it has been found\r\nthat gold and silver afford the only safe foundation for a monetary\r\nsystem. Confusion has recently been created by variations in the\r\nrelative value of the two metals, but I confidently believe that\r\narrangements can be made between the leading commercial nations which\r\nwill secure the general use of both metals. Congress should provide that\r\nthe compulsory coinage of silver now required by law may not disturb our\r\nmonetary system by driving either metal out of circulation. If possible,\r\nsuch an adjustment should be made that the purchasing power of every\r\ncoined dollar will be exactly equal to its debt-paying power in all the\r\nmarkets of the world.\r\n\r\nThe chief duty of the National Government in connection with the\r\ncurrency of the country is to coin money and declare its value. Grave\r\ndoubts have been entertained whether Congress is authorized by the\r\nConstitution to make any form of paper money legal tender. The present\r\nissue of United States notes has been sustained by the necessities of\r\nwar; but such paper should depend for its value and currency upon its\r\nconvenience in use and its prompt redemption in coin at the will of the\r\nholder, and not upon its compulsory circulation. These notes are not\r\nmoney, but promises to pay money. If the holders demand it, the promise\r\nshould be kept.\r\n\r\nThe refunding of the national debt at a lower rate of interest should be\r\naccomplished without compelling the withdrawal of the national-bank\r\nnotes, and thus disturbing the business of the country.\r\n\r\nI venture to refer to the position I have occupied on financial\r\nquestions during a long service in Congress, and to say that time and\r\nexperience have strengthened the opinions I have so often expressed on\r\nthese subjects.\r\n\r\nThe finances of the Government shall suffer no detriment which it may be\r\npossible for my Administration to prevent.\r\n\r\nThe interests of agriculture deserve more attention from the Government\r\nthan they have yet received. The farms of the United States afford homes\r\nand employment for more than one-half our people, and furnish much the\r\nlargest part of all our exports. As the Government lights our coasts for\r\nthe protection of mariners and the benefit of commerce, so it should\r\ngive to the tillers of the soil the best lights of practical science and\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nOur manufacturers are rapidly making us industrially independent, and\r\nare opening to capital and labor new and profitable fields of\r\nemployment. Their steady and healthy growth should still be matured. Our\r\nfacilities for transportation should be promoted by the continued\r\nimprovement of our harbors and great interior waterways and by the\r\nincrease of our tonnage on the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe development of the world's commerce has led to an urgent demand for\r\nshortening the great sea voyage around Cape Horn by constructing ship\r\ncanals or railways across the isthmus which unites the continents.\r\nVarious plans to this end have been suggested and will need\r\nconsideration, but none of them has been sufficiently matured to warrant\r\nthe United States in extending pecuniary aid. The subject, however, is\r\none which will immediately engage the attention of the Government with a\r\nview to a thorough protection to American interests. We will urge no\r\nnarrow policy nor seek peculiar or exclusive privileges in any\r\ncommercial route; but, in the language of my predecessor, I believe it\r\nto be the right \"and duty of the United States to assert and maintain\r\nsuch supervision and authority over any interoceanic canal across the\r\nisthmus that connects North and South America as will protect our\r\nnational interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe Constitution guarantees absolute religious freedom. Congress is\r\nprohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion\r\nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof. The Territories of the United\r\nStates are subject to the direct legislative authority of Congress, and\r\nhence the General Government is responsible for any violation of the\r\nConstitution in any of them. It is therefore a reproach to the\r\nGovernment that in the most populous of the Territories the\r\nconstitutional guaranty is not enjoyed by the people and the authority\r\nof Congress is set at naught. The Mormon Church not only offends the\r\nmoral sense of manhood by sanctioning polygamy, but prevents the\r\nadministration of justice through ordinary instrumentalities of law.\r\n\r\nIn my judgment it is the duty of Congress, while respecting to the\r\nuttermost the conscientious convictions and religious scruples of every\r\ncitizen, to prohibit within its jurisdiction all criminal practices,\r\nespecially of that class which destroy the family relations and endanger\r\nsocial order. Nor can any ecclesiastical organization be safely\r\npermitted to usurp in the smallest degree the functions and powers of\r\nthe National Government.\r\n\r\nThe civil service can never be placed on a satisfactory basis until it\r\nis regulated by law. For the good of the service itself, for the\r\nprotection of those who are intrusted with the appointing power against\r\nthe waste of time and obstruction to the public business caused by the\r\ninordinate pressure for place, and for the protection of incumbents\r\nagainst intrigue and wrong, I shall at the proper time ask Congress to\r\nfix the tenure of the minor offices of the several Executive Departments\r\nand prescribe the grounds upon which removals shall be made during the\r\nterms for which incumbents have been appointed.\r\n\r\nFinally, acting always within the authority and limitations of the\r\nConstitution, invading neither the rights of the States nor the reserved\r\nrights of the people, it will be the purpose of my Administration to\r\nmaintain the authority of the nation in all places within its\r\njurisdiction; to enforce obedience to all the laws of the Union in the\r\ninterests of the people; to demand rigid economy in all the expenditures\r\nof the Government, and to require the honest and faithful service of all\r\nexecutive officers, remembering that the offices were created, not for\r\nthe benefit of incumbents or their supporters, but for the service of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, I am about to assume the great trust which you\r\nhave committed to my hands. I appeal to you for that earnest and\r\nthoughtful support which makes this Government in fact, as it is in law,\r\na government of the people.\r\n\r\nI shall greatly rely upon the wisdom and patriotism of Congress and of\r\nthose who may share with me the responsibilities and duties of\r\nadministration, and, above all, upon our efforts to promote the welfare\r\nof this great people and their Government I reverently invoke the\r\nsupport and blessings of Almighty God.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1885\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  On the East Portico of the Capitol, the former\r\nGovernor of New York was administered the oath of office by Chief\r\nJustice Morrison Waite. A Democrat whose popularity, in part, was the\r\nresult that he was not part of the Washington political establishment,\r\nMr. Cleveland rode to the Capitol with President Arthur, who had taken\r\noffice upon the assassination of President Garfield. After the ceremony,\r\na fireworks display at the White House and a ball at the Pension\r\nBuilding on Judiciary Square were held for the public.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nIn the presence of this vast assemblage of my countrymen I am about to\r\nsupplement and seal by the oath which I shall take the manifestation of\r\nthe will of a great and free people. In the exercise of their power and\r\nright of self-government they have committed to one of their\r\nfellow-citizens a supreme and sacred trust, and he here consecrates\r\nhimself to their service.\r\n\r\nThis impressive ceremony adds little to the solemn sense of\r\nresponsibility with which I contemplate the duty I owe to all the people\r\nof the land. Nothing can relieve me from anxiety lest by any act of mine\r\ntheir interests may suffer, and nothing is needed to strengthen my\r\nresolution to engage every faculty and effort in the promotion of their\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nAmid the din of party strife the people's choice was made, but its\r\nattendant circumstances have demonstrated anew the strength and safety\r\nof a government by the people. In each succeeding year it more clearly\r\nappears that our democratic principle needs no apology, and that in its\r\nfearless and faithful application is to be found the surest guaranty of\r\ngood government.\r\n\r\nBut the best results in the operation of a government wherein every\r\ncitizen has a share largely depend upon a proper limitation of purely\r\npartisan zeal and effort and a correct appreciation of the time when the\r\nheat of the partisan should be merged in the patriotism of the citizen.\r\n\r\nTo-day the executive branch of the Government is transferred to new\r\nkeeping. But this is still the Government of all the people, and it\r\nshould be none the less an object of their affectionate solicitude. At\r\nthis hour the animosities of political strife, the bitterness of\r\npartisan defeat, and the exultation of partisan triumph should be\r\nsupplanted by an ungrudging acquiescence in the popular will and a\r\nsober, conscientious concern for the general weal. Moreover, if from\r\nthis hour we cheerfully and honestly abandon all sectional prejudice and\r\ndistrust, and determine, with manly confidence in one another, to work\r\nout harmoniously the achievements of our national destiny, we shall\r\ndeserve to realize all the benefits which our happy form of government\r\ncan bestow.\r\n\r\nOn this auspicious occasion we may well renew the pledge of our devotion\r\nto the Constitution, which, launched by the founders of the Republic and\r\nconsecrated by their prayers and patriotic devotion, has for almost a\r\ncentury borne the hopes and the aspirations of a great people through\r\nprosperity and peace and through the shock of foreign conflicts and the\r\nperils of domestic strife and vicissitudes.\r\n\r\nBy the Father of his Country our Constitution was commended for adoption\r\nas \"the result of a spirit of amity and mutual concession.\" In that same\r\nspirit it should be administered, in order to promote the lasting\r\nwelfare of the country and to secure the full measure of its priceless\r\nbenefits to us and to those who will succeed to the blessings of our\r\nnational life. The large variety of diverse and competing interests\r\nsubject to Federal control, persistently seeking the recognition of\r\ntheir claims, need give us no fear that \"the greatest good to the\r\ngreatest number\" will fail to be accomplished if in the halls of\r\nnational legislation that spirit of amity and mutual concession shall\r\nprevail in which the Constitution had its birth. If this involves the\r\nsurrender or postponement of private interests and the abandonment of\r\nlocal advantages, compensation will be found in the assurance that the\r\ncommon interest is subserved and the general welfare advanced.\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of my official duty I shall endeavor to be guided by a\r\njust and unstrained construction of the Constitution, a careful\r\nobservance of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal\r\nGovernment and those reserved to the States or to the people, and by a\r\ncautious appreciation of those functions which by the Constitution and\r\nlaws have been especially assigned to the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBut he who takes the oath today to preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution of the United States only assumes the solemn obligation\r\nwhich every patriotic citizen--on the farm, in the workshop, in the busy\r\nmarts of trade, and everywhere--should share with him. The Constitution\r\nwhich prescribes his oath, my countrymen, is yours; the Government you\r\nhave chosen him to administer for a time is yours; the suffrage which\r\nexecutes the will of freemen is yours; the laws and the entire scheme of\r\nour civil rule, from the town meeting to the State capitals and the\r\nnational capital, is yours. Your every voter, as surely as your Chief\r\nMagistrate, under the same high sanction, though in a different sphere,\r\nexercises a public trust. Nor is this all. Every citizen owes to the\r\ncountry a vigilant watch and close scrutiny of its public servants and a\r\nfair and reasonable estimate of their fidelity and usefulness. Thus is\r\nthe people's will impressed upon the whole framework of our civil\r\npolity--municipal, State, and Federal; and this is the price of our\r\nliberty and the inspiration of our faith in the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of those serving the people in public place to closely\r\nlimit public expenditures to the actual needs of the Government\r\neconomically administered, because this bounds the right of the\r\nGovernment to exact tribute from the earnings of labor or the property\r\nof the citizen, and because public extravagance begets extravagance\r\namong the people. We should never be ashamed of the simplicity and\r\nprudential economies which are best suited to the operation of a\r\nrepublican form of government and most compatible with the mission of\r\nthe American people. Those who are selected for a limited time to manage\r\npublic affairs are still of the people, and may do much by their example\r\nto encourage, consistently with the dignity of their official functions,\r\nthat plain way of life which among their fellow-citizens aids integrity\r\nand promotes thrift and prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe genius of our institutions, the needs of our people in their home\r\nlife, and the attention which is demanded for the settlement and\r\ndevelopment of the resources of our vast territory dictate the\r\nscrupulous avoidance of any departure from that foreign policy commended\r\nby the history, the traditions, and the prosperity of our Republic. It\r\nis the policy of independence, favored by our position and defended by\r\nour known love of justice and by our power. It is the policy of peace\r\nsuitable to our interests. It is the policy of neutrality, rejecting any\r\nshare in foreign broils and ambitions upon other continents and\r\nrepelling their intrusion here. It is the policy of Monroe and of\r\nWashington and Jefferson--\"Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with\r\nall nations; entangling alliance with none.\"\r\n\r\nA due regard for the interests and prosperity of all the people demands\r\nthat our finances shall be established upon such a sound and sensible\r\nbasis as shall secure the safety and confidence of business interests\r\nand make the wage of labor sure and steady, and that our system of\r\nrevenue shall be so adjusted as to relieve the people of unnecessary\r\ntaxation, having a due regard to the interests of capital invested and\r\nworkingmen employed in American industries, and preventing the\r\naccumulation of a surplus in the Treasury to tempt extravagance and\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nCare for the property of the nation and for the needs of future settlers\r\nrequires that the public domain should be protected from purloining\r\nschemes and unlawful occupation.\r\n\r\nThe conscience of the people demands that the Indians within our\r\nboundaries shall be fairly and honestly treated as wards of the\r\nGovernment and their education and civilization promoted with a view to\r\ntheir ultimate citizenship, and that polygamy in the Territories,\r\ndestructive of the family relation and offensive to the moral sense of\r\nthe civilized world, shall be repressed.\r\n\r\nThe laws should be rigidly enforced which prohibit the immigration of a\r\nservile class to compete with American labor, with no intention of\r\nacquiring citizenship, and bringing with them and retaining habits and\r\ncustoms repugnant to our civilization.\r\n\r\nThe people demand reform in the administration of the Government and the\r\napplication of business principles to public affairs. As a means to this\r\nend, civil-service reform should be in good faith enforced. Our citizens\r\nhave the right to protection from the incompetency of public employees\r\nwho hold their places solely as the reward of partisan service, and from\r\nthe corrupting influence of those who promise and the vicious methods of\r\nthose who expect such rewards; and those who worthily seek public\r\nemployment have the right to insist that merit and competency shall be\r\nrecognized instead of party subserviency or the surrender of honest\r\npolitical belief.\r\n\r\nIn the administration of a government pledged to do equal and exact\r\njustice to all men there should be no pretext for anxiety touching the\r\nprotection of the freedmen in their rights or their security in the\r\nenjoyment of their privileges under the Constitution and its amendments.\r\nAll discussion as to their fitness for the place accorded to them as\r\nAmerican citizens is idle and unprofitable except as it suggests the\r\nnecessity for their improvement. The fact that they are citizens\r\nentitles them to all the rights due to that relation and charges them\r\nwith all its duties, obligations, and responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThese topics and the constant and ever-varying wants of an active and\r\nenterprising population may well receive the attention and the patriotic\r\nendeavor of all who make and execute the Federal law. Our duties are\r\npractical and call for industrious application, an intelligent\r\nperception of the claims of public office, and, above all, a firm\r\ndetermination, by united action, to secure to all the people of the land\r\nthe full benefits of the best form of government ever vouchsafed to man.\r\nAnd let us not trust to human effort alone, but humbly acknowledging the\r\npower and goodness of Almighty God, who presides over the destiny of\r\nnations, and who has at all times been revealed in our country's\r\nhistory, let us invoke His aid and His blessings upon our labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN HARRISON, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MARCH 4, 1889\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  Nominated on the 8th ballot of the Republican\r\nconvention, the Civil War veteran, jurist, and Senator from Indiana was\r\nthe only grandson of a President to be elected to the office, as well as\r\nthe only incumbent to lose in the following election to the person he\r\nhad defeated. In a rainstorm, the oath of office was administered by\r\nChief Justice Melville Fuller on the East Portico of the Capitol.\r\nPresident Cleveland held an umbrella over his head as he took the oath.\r\nJohn Philip Sousa's Marine Corps band played for a large crowd at the\r\ninaugural ball in the Pension Building.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nThere is no constitutional or legal requirement that the President shall\r\ntake the oath of office in the presence of the people, but there is so\r\nmanifest an appropriateness in the public induction to office of the\r\nchief executive officer of the nation that from the beginning of the\r\nGovernment the people, to whose service the official oath consecrates\r\nthe officer, have been called to witness the solemn ceremonial. The oath\r\ntaken in the presence of the people becomes a mutual covenant. The\r\nofficer covenants to serve the whole body of the people by a faithful\r\nexecution of the laws, so that they may be the unfailing defense and\r\nsecurity of those who respect and observe them, and that neither wealth,\r\nstation, nor the power of combinations shall be able to evade their just\r\npenalties or to wrest them from a beneficent public purpose to serve the\r\nends of cruelty or selfishness.\r\n\r\nMy promise is spoken; yours unspoken, but not the less real and solemn.\r\nThe people of every State have here their representatives. Surely I do\r\nnot misinterpret the spirit of the occasion when I assume that the whole\r\nbody of the people covenant with me and with each other to-day to\r\nsupport and defend the Constitution and the Union of the States, to\r\nyield willing obedience to all the laws and each to every other citizen\r\nhis equal civil and political rights. Entering thus solemnly into\r\ncovenant with each other, we may reverently invoke and confidently\r\nexpect the favor and help of Almighty God--that He will give to me\r\nwisdom, strength, and fidelity, and to our people a spirit of fraternity\r\nand a love of righteousness and peace.\r\n\r\nThis occasion derives peculiar interest from the fact that the\r\nPresidential term which begins this day is the twenty-sixth under our\r\nConstitution. The first inauguration of President Washington took place\r\nin New York, where Congress was then sitting, on the 30th day of April,\r\n1789, having been deferred by reason of delays attending the\r\norganization of the Congress and the canvass of the electoral vote. Our\r\npeople have already worthily observed the centennials of the Declaration\r\nof Independence, of the battle of Yorktown, and of the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, and will shortly celebrate in New York the institution of\r\nthe second great department of our constitutional scheme of government.\r\nWhen the centennial of the institution of the judicial department, by\r\nthe organization of the Supreme Court, shall have been suitably\r\nobserved, as I trust it will be, our nation will have fully entered its\r\nsecond century.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to note the marvelous and in great part happy\r\ncontrasts between our country as it steps over the threshold into its\r\nsecond century of organized existence under the Constitution and that\r\nweak but wisely ordered young nation that looked undauntedly down the\r\nfirst century, when all its years stretched out before it.\r\n\r\nOur people will not fail at this time to recall the incidents which\r\naccompanied the institution of government under the Constitution, or to\r\nfind inspiration and guidance in the teachings and example of Washington\r\nand his great associates, and hope and courage in the contrast which\r\nthirty-eight populous and prosperous States offer to the thirteen\r\nStates, weak in everything except courage and the love of liberty, that\r\nthen fringed our Atlantic seaboard.\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Dakota has now a population greater than any of the\r\noriginal States (except Virginia) and greater than the aggregate of five\r\nof the smaller States in 1790. The center of population when our\r\nnational capital was located was east of Baltimore, and it was argued by\r\nmany well-informed persons that it would move eastward rather than\r\nwestward; yet in 1880 it was found to be near Cincinnati, and the new\r\ncensus about to be taken will show another stride to the westward. That\r\nwhich was the body has come to be only the rich fringe of the nation's\r\nrobe. But our growth has not been limited to territory, population and\r\naggregate wealth, marvelous as it has been in each of those directions.\r\nThe masses of our people are better fed, clothed, and housed than their\r\nfathers were. The facilities for popular education have been vastly\r\nenlarged and more generally diffused.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of courage and patriotism have given recent proof of their\r\ncontinued presence and increasing power in the hearts and over the lives\r\nof our people. The influences of religion have been multiplied and\r\nstrengthened. The sweet offices of charity have greatly increased. The\r\nvirtue of temperance is held in higher estimation. We have not attained\r\nan ideal condition. Not all of our people are happy and prosperous; not\r\nall of them are virtuous and law-abiding. But on the whole the\r\nopportunities offered to the individual to secure the comforts of life\r\nare better than are found elsewhere and largely better than they were\r\nhere one hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of a large measure of sovereignty to the General\r\nGovernment, effected by the adoption of the Constitution, was not\r\naccomplished until the suggestions of reason were strongly reenforced by\r\nthe more imperative voice of experience. The divergent interests of\r\npeace speedily demanded a \"more perfect union.\" The merchant, the\r\nshipmaster, and the manufacturer discovered and disclosed to our\r\nstatesmen and to the people that commercial emancipation must be added\r\nto the political freedom which had been so bravely won. The commercial\r\npolicy of the mother country had not relaxed any of its hard and\r\noppressive features. To hold in check the development of our commercial\r\nmarine, to prevent or retard the establishment and growth of\r\nmanufactures in the States, and so to secure the American market for\r\ntheir shops and the carrying trade for their ships, was the policy of\r\nEuropean statesmen, and was pursued with the most selfish vigor.\r\n\r\nPetitions poured in upon Congress urging the imposition of\r\ndiscriminating duties that should encourage the production of needed\r\nthings at home. The patriotism of the people, which no longer found\r\nafield of exercise in war, was energetically directed to the duty of\r\nequipping the young Republic for the defense of its independence by\r\nmaking its people self-dependent. Societies for the promotion of home\r\nmanufactures and for encouraging the use of domestics in the dress of\r\nthe people were organized in many of the States. The revival at the end\r\nof the century of the same patriotic interest in the preservation and\r\ndevelopment of domestic industries and the defense of our working people\r\nagainst injurious foreign competition is an incident worthy of\r\nattention. It is not a departure but a return that we have witnessed.\r\nThe protective policy had then its opponents. The argument was made, as\r\nnow, that its benefits inured to particular classes or sections.\r\n\r\nIf the question became in any sense or at any time sectional, it was\r\nonly because slavery existed in some of the States. But for this there\r\nwas no reason why the cotton-producing States should not have led or\r\nwalked abreast with the New England States in the production of cotton\r\nfabrics. There was this reason only why the States that divide with\r\nPennsylvania the mineral treasures of the great southeastern and central\r\nmountain ranges should have been so tardy in bringing to the smelting\r\nfurnace and to the mill the coal and iron from their near opposing\r\nhillsides. Mill fires were lighted at the funeral pile of slavery. The\r\nemancipation proclamation was heard in the depths of the earth as well\r\nas in the sky; men were made free, and material things became our better\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nThe sectional element has happily been eliminated from the tariff\r\ndiscussion. We have no longer States that are necessarily only planting\r\nStates. None are excluded from achieving that diversification of\r\npursuits among the people which brings wealth and contentment. The\r\ncotton plantation will not be less valuable when the product is spun in\r\nthe country town by operatives whose necessities call for diversified\r\ncrops and create a home demand for garden and agricultural products.\r\nEvery new mine, furnace, and factory is an extension of the productive\r\ncapacity of the State more real and valuable than added territory.\r\n\r\nShall the prejudices and paralysis of slavery continue to hang upon the\r\nskirts of progress? How long will those who rejoice that slavery no\r\nlonger exists cherish or tolerate the incapacities it put upon their\r\ncommunities? I look hopefully to the continuance of our protective\r\nsystem and to the consequent development of manufacturing and mining\r\nenterprises in the States hitherto wholly given to agriculture as a\r\npotent influence in the perfect unification of our people. The men who\r\nhave invested their capital in these enterprises, the farmers who have\r\nfelt the benefit of their neighborhood, and the men who work in shop or\r\nfield will not fail to find and to defend a community of interest.\r\n\r\nIs it not quite possible that the farmers and the promoters of the great\r\nmining and manufacturing enterprises which have recently been\r\nestablished in the South may yet find that the free ballot of the\r\nworkingman, without distinction of race, is needed for their defense as\r\nwell as for his own? I do not doubt that if those men in the South who\r\nnow accept the tariff views of Clay and the constitutional expositions\r\nof Webster would courageously avow and defend their real convictions\r\nthey would not find it difficult, by friendly instruction and\r\ncooperation, to make the black man their efficient and safe ally, not\r\nonly in establishing correct principles in our national administration,\r\nbut in preserving for their local communities the benefits of social\r\norder and economical and honest government. At least until the good\r\noffices of kindness and education have been fairly tried the contrary\r\nconclusion can not be plausibly urged.\r\n\r\nI have altogether rejected the suggestion of a special Executive policy\r\nfor any section of our country. It is the duty of the Executive to\r\nadminister and enforce in the methods and by the instrumentalities\r\npointed out and provided by the Constitution all the laws enacted by\r\nCongress. These laws are general and their administration should be\r\nuniform and equal. As a citizen may not elect what laws he will obey,\r\nneither may the Executive eject which he will enforce. The duty to obey\r\nand to execute embraces the Constitution in its entirety and the whole\r\ncode of laws enacted under it. The evil example of permitting\r\nindividuals, corporations, or communities to nullify the laws because\r\nthey cross some selfish or local interest or prejudices is full of\r\ndanger, not only to the nation at large, but much more to those who use\r\nthis pernicious expedient to escape their just obligations or to obtain\r\nan unjust advantage over others. They will presently themselves be\r\ncompelled to appeal to the law for protection, and those who would use\r\nthe law as a defense must not deny that use of it to others.\r\n\r\nIf our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their legal\r\nlimitations and duties, they would have less cause to complain of the\r\nunlawful limitations of their rights or of violent interference with\r\ntheir operations. The community that by concert, open or secret, among\r\nits citizens denies to a portion of its members their plain rights under\r\nthe law has severed the only safe bond of social order and prosperity.\r\nThe evil works from a bad center both ways. It demoralizes those who\r\npractice it and destroys the faith of those who suffer by it in the\r\nefficiency of the law as a safe protector. The man in whose breast that\r\nfaith has been darkened is naturally the subject of dangerous and\r\nuncanny suggestions. Those who use unlawful methods, if moved by no\r\nhigher motive than the selfishness that prompted them, may well stop and\r\ninquire what is to be the end of this.\r\n\r\nAn unlawful expedient can not become a permanent condition of\r\ngovernment. If the educated and influential classes in a community\r\neither practice or connive at the systematic violation of laws that seem\r\nto them to cross their convenience, what can they expect when the lesson\r\nthat convenience or a supposed class interest is a sufficient cause for\r\nlawlessness has been well learned by the ignorant classes? A community\r\nwhere law is the rule of conduct and where courts, not mobs, execute its\r\npenalties is the only attractive field for business investments and\r\nhonest labor.\r\n\r\nOur naturalization laws should be so amended as to make the inquiry into\r\nthe character and good disposition of persons applying for citizenship\r\nmore careful and searching. Our existing laws have been in their\r\nadministration an unimpressive and often an unintelligible form. We\r\naccept the man as a citizen without any knowledge of his fitness, and he\r\nassumes the duties of citizenship without any knowledge as to what they\r\nare. The privileges of American citizenship are so great and its duties\r\nso grave that we may well insist upon a good knowledge of every person\r\napplying for citizenship and a good knowledge by him of our\r\ninstitutions. We should not cease to be hospitable to immigration, but\r\nwe should cease to be careless as to the character of it. There are men\r\nof all races, even the best, whose coming is necessarily a burden upon\r\nour public revenues or a threat to social order. These should be\r\nidentified and excluded.\r\n\r\nWe have happily maintained a policy of avoiding all interference with\r\nEuropean affairs. We have been only interested spectators of their\r\ncontentions in diplomacy and in war, ready to use our friendly offices\r\nto promote peace, but never obtruding our advice and never attempting\r\nunfairly to coin the distresses of other powers into commercial\r\nadvantage to ourselves. We have a just right to expect that our European\r\npolicy will be the American policy of European courts.\r\n\r\nIt is so manifestly incompatible with those precautions for our peace\r\nand safety which all the great powers habitually observe and enforce in\r\nmatters affecting them that a shorter waterway between our eastern and\r\nwestern seaboards should be dominated by any European Government that we\r\nmay confidently expect that such a purpose will not be entertained by\r\nany friendly power.\r\n\r\nWe shall in the future, as in the past, use every endeavor to maintain\r\nand enlarge our friendly relations with all the great powers, but they\r\nwill not expect us to look kindly upon any project that would leave us\r\nsubject to the dangers of a hostile observation or environment. We have\r\nnot sought to dominate or to absorb any of our weaker neighbors, but\r\nrather to aid and encourage them to establish free and stable\r\ngovernments resting upon the consent of their own people. We have a\r\nclear right to expect, therefore, that no European Government will seek\r\nto establish colonial dependencies upon the territory of these\r\nindependent American States. That which a sense of justice restrains us\r\nfrom seeking they may be reasonably expected willingly to forego.\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed, however, that our interests are so exclusively\r\nAmerican that our entire inattention to any events that may transpire\r\nelsewhere can be taken for granted. Our citizens domiciled for purposes\r\nof trade in all countries and in many of the islands of the sea demand\r\nand will have our adequate care in their personal and commercial rights.\r\nThe necessities of our Navy require convenient coaling stations and dock\r\nand harbor privileges. These and other trading privileges we will feel\r\nfree to obtain only by means that do not in any degree partake of\r\ncoercion, however feeble the government from which we ask such\r\nconcessions. But having fairly obtained them by methods and for purposes\r\nentirely consistent with the most friendly disposition toward all other\r\npowers, our consent will be necessary to any modification or impairment\r\nof the concession.\r\n\r\nWe shall neither fail to respect the flag of any friendly nation or the\r\njust rights of its citizens, nor to exact the like treatment for our\r\nown. Calmness, justice, and consideration should characterize our\r\ndiplomacy. The offices of an intelligent diplomacy or of friendly\r\narbitration in proper cases should be adequate to the peaceful\r\nadjustment of all international difficulties. By such methods we will\r\nmake our contribution to the world's peace, which no nation values more\r\nhighly, and avoid the opprobrium which must fall upon the nation that\r\nruthlessly breaks it.\r\n\r\nThe duty devolved by law upon the President to nominate and, by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint all public officers\r\nwhose appointment is not otherwise provided for in the Constitution or\r\nby act of Congress has become very burdensome and its wise and efficient\r\ndischarge full of difficulty. The civil list is so large that a personal\r\nknowledge of any large number of the applicants is impossible. The\r\nPresident must rely upon the representations of others, and these are\r\noften made inconsiderately and without any just sense of responsibility.\r\nI have a right, I think, to insist that those who volunteer or are\r\ninvited to give advice as to appointments shall exercise consideration\r\nand fidelity. A high sense of duty and an ambition to improve the\r\nservice should characterize all public officers.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways in which the convenience and comfort of those who\r\nhave business with our public offices may be promoted by a thoughtful\r\nand obliging officer, and I shall expect those whom I may appoint to\r\njustify their selection by a conspicuous efficiency in the discharge of\r\ntheir duties. Honorable party service will certainly not be esteemed by\r\nme a disqualification for public office, but it will in no case be\r\nallowed to serve as a shield of official negligence, incompetency, or\r\ndelinquency. It is entirely creditable to seek public office by proper\r\nmethods and with proper motives, and all applicants will be treated with\r\nconsideration; but I shall need, and the heads of Departments will need,\r\ntime for inquiry and deliberation. Persistent importunity will not,\r\ntherefore, be the best support of an application for office. Heads of\r\nDepartments, bureaus, and all other public officers having any duty\r\nconnected therewith will be expected to enforce the civil-service law\r\nfully and without evasion. Beyond this obvious duty I hope to do\r\nsomething more to advance the reform of the civil service. The ideal, or\r\neven my own ideal, I shall probably not attain. Retrospect will be a\r\nsafer basis of judgment than promises. We shall not, however, I am sure,\r\nbe able to put our civil service upon a nonpartisan basis until we have\r\nsecured an incumbency that fair-minded men of the opposition will\r\napprove for impartiality and integrity. As the number of such in the\r\ncivil list is increased removals from office will diminish.\r\n\r\nWhile a Treasury surplus is not the greatest evil, it is a serious evil.\r\nOur revenue should be ample to meet the ordinary annual demands upon our\r\nTreasury, with a sufficient margin for those extraordinary but scarcely\r\nless imperative demands which arise now and then. Expenditure should\r\nalways be made with economy and only upon public necessity.\r\nWastefulness, profligacy, or favoritism in public expenditures is\r\ncriminal. But there is nothing in the condition of our country or of our\r\npeople to suggest that anything presently necessary to the public\r\nprosperity, security, or honor should be unduly postponed.\r\n\r\nIt will be the duty of Congress wisely to forecast and estimate these\r\nextraordinary demands, and, having added them to our ordinary\r\nexpenditures, to so adjust our revenue laws that no considerable annual\r\nsurplus will remain. We will fortunately be able to apply to the\r\nredemption of the public debt any small and unforeseen excess of\r\nrevenue. This is better than to reduce our income below our necessary\r\nexpenditures, with the resulting choice between another change of our\r\nrevenue laws and an increase of the public debt. It is quite possible, I\r\nam sure, to effect the necessary reduction in our revenues without\r\nbreaking down our protective tariff or seriously injuring any domestic\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a sufficient number of modern war ships and of their\r\nnecessary armament should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care\r\nand perfection in plans and workmanship. The spirit, courage, and skill\r\nof our naval officers and seamen have many times in our history given to\r\nweak ships and inefficient guns a rating greatly beyond that of the\r\nnaval list. That they will again do so upon occasion I do not doubt; but\r\nthey ought not, by premeditation or neglect, to be left to the risks and\r\nexigencies of an unequal combat. We should encourage the establishment\r\nof American steamship lines. The exchanges of commerce demand stated,\r\nreliable, and rapid means of communication, and until these are provided\r\nthe development of our trade with the States lying south of us is\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nOur pension laws should give more adequate and discriminating relief to\r\nthe Union soldiers and sailors and to their widows and orphans. Such\r\noccasions as this should remind us that we owe everything to their valor\r\nand sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of congratulation that there is a near prospect of the\r\nadmission into the Union of the Dakotas and Montana and Washington\r\nTerritories. This act of justice has been unreasonably delayed in the\r\ncase of some of them. The people who have settled these Territories are\r\nintelligent, enterprising, and patriotic, and the accession these new\r\nStates will add strength to the nation. It is due to the settlers in the\r\nTerritories who have availed themselves of the invitations of our land\r\nlaws to make homes upon the public domain that their titles should be\r\nspeedily adjusted and their honest entries confirmed by patent.\r\n\r\nIt is very gratifying to observe the general interest now being\r\nmanifested in the reform of our election laws. Those who have been for\r\nyears calling attention to the pressing necessity of throwing about the\r\nballot box and about the elector further safeguards, in order that our\r\nelections might not only be free and pure, but might clearly appear to\r\nbe so, will welcome the accession of any who did not so soon discover\r\nthe need of reform. The National Congress has not as yet taken control\r\nof elections in that case over which the Constitution gives it\r\njurisdiction, but has accepted and adopted the election laws of the\r\nseveral States, provided penalties for their violation and a method of\r\nsupervision. Only the inefficiency of the State laws or an unfair\r\npartisan administration of them could suggest a departure from this\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nIt was clearly, however, in the contemplation of the framers of the\r\nConstitution that such an exigency might arise, and provision was wisely\r\nmade for it. The freedom of the ballot is a condition of our national\r\nlife, and no power vested in Congress or in the Executive to secure or\r\nperpetuate it should remain unused upon occasion. The people of all the\r\nCongressional districts have an equal interest that the election in each\r\nshall truly express the views and wishes of a majority of the qualified\r\nelectors residing within it. The results of such elections are not\r\nlocal, and the insistence of electors residing in other districts that\r\nthey shall be pure and free does not savor at all of impertinence.\r\n\r\nIf in any of the States the public security is thought to be threatened\r\nby ignorance among the electors, the obvious remedy is education. The\r\nsympathy and help of our people will not be withheld from any community\r\nstruggling with special embarrassments or difficulties connected with\r\nthe suffrage if the remedies proposed proceed upon lawful lines and are\r\npromoted by just and honorable methods. How shall those who practice\r\nelection frauds recover that respect for the sanctity of the ballot\r\nwhich is the first condition and obligation of good citizenship? The man\r\nwho has come to regard the ballot box as a juggler's hat has renounced\r\nhis allegiance.\r\n\r\nLet us exalt patriotism and moderate our party contentions. Let those\r\nwho would die for the flag on the field of battle give a better proof of\r\ntheir patriotism and a higher glory to their country by promoting\r\nfraternity and justice. A party success that is achieved by unfair\r\nmethods or by practices that partake of revolution is hurtful and\r\nevanescent even from a party standpoint. We should hold our differing\r\nopinions in mutual respect, and, having submitted them to the\r\narbitrament of the ballot, should accept an adverse judgment with the\r\nsame respect that we would have demanded of our opponents if the\r\ndecision had been in our favor.\r\n\r\nNo other people have a government more worthy of their respect and love\r\nor a land so magnificent in extent, so pleasant to look upon, and so\r\nfull of generous suggestion to enterprise and labor. God has placed upon\r\nour head a diadem and has laid at our feet power and wealth beyond\r\ndefinition or calculation. But we must not forget that we take these\r\ngifts upon the condition that justice and mercy shall hold the reins of\r\npower and that the upward avenues of hope shall be free to all the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI do not mistrust the future. Dangers have been in frequent ambush along\r\nour path, but we have uncovered and vanquished them all. Passion has\r\nswept some of our communities, but only to give us a new demonstration\r\nthat the great body of our people are stable, patriotic, and\r\nlaw-abiding. No political party can long pursue advantage at the expense\r\nof public honor or by rude and indecent methods without protest and\r\nfatal disaffection in its own body. The peaceful agencies of commerce\r\nare more fully revealing the necessary unity of all our communities, and\r\nthe increasing intercourse of our people is promoting mutual respect. We\r\nshall find unalloyed pleasure in the revelation which our next census\r\nwill make of the swift development of the great resources of some of the\r\nStates. Each State will bring its generous contribution to the great\r\naggregate of the nation's increase. And when the harvests from the\r\nfields, the cattle from the hills, and the ores of the earth shall have\r\nbeen weighed, counted, and valued, we will turn from them all to crown\r\nwith the highest honor the State that has most promoted education,\r\nvirtue, justice, and patriotism among its people.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROVER CLEVELAND, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1893\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  A light snowfall the night before the inauguration\r\ndiscouraged many spectators from attending President Cleveland's second\r\ninauguration. The Democrat had decisively defeated President Harrison in\r\nthe election of 1892. Chief Justice Melville Fuller administered the\r\noath of office on the East Portico of the Capitol. The inaugural ball at\r\nthe Pension Building featured the new invention of electric lights.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nIn obedience of the mandate of my countrymen I am about to dedicate\r\nmyself to their service under the sanction of a solemn oath. Deeply\r\nmoved by the expression of confidence and personal attachment which has\r\ncalled me to this service, I am sure my gratitude can make no better\r\nreturn than the pledge I now give before God and these witnesses of\r\nunreserved and complete devotion to the interests and welfare of those\r\nwho have honored me.\r\n\r\nI deem it fitting on this occasion, while indicating the opinion I hold\r\nconcerning public questions of present importance, to also briefly refer\r\nto the existence of certain conditions and tendencies among our people\r\nwhich seem to menace the integrity and usefulness of their Government.\r\n\r\nWhile every American citizen must contemplate with the utmost pride and\r\nenthusiasm the growth and expansion of our country, the sufficiency of\r\nour institutions to stand against the rudest shocks of violence, the\r\nwonderful thrift and enterprise of our people, and the demonstrated\r\nsuperiority of our free government, it behooves us to constantly watch\r\nfor every symptom of insidious infirmity that threatens our national\r\nvigor.\r\n\r\nThe strong man who in the confidence of sturdy health courts the\r\nsternest activities of life and rejoices in the hardihood of constant\r\nlabor may still have lurking near his vitals the unheeded disease that\r\ndooms him to sudden collapse.\r\n\r\nIt can not be doubted that our stupendous achievements as a people and\r\nour country's robust strength have given rise to heedlessness of those\r\nlaws governing our national health which we can no more evade than human\r\nlife can escape the laws of God and nature.\r\n\r\nManifestly nothing is more vital to our supremacy as a nation and to the\r\nbeneficent purposes of our Government than a sound and stable currency.\r\nIts exposure to degradation should at once arouse to activity the most\r\nenlightened statesmanship, and the danger of depreciation in the\r\npurchasing power of the wages paid to toil should furnish the strongest\r\nincentive to prompt and conservative precaution.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with our present embarrassing situation as related to this\r\nsubject we will be wise if we temper our confidence and faith in our\r\nnational strength and resources with the frank concession that even\r\nthese will not permit us to defy with impunity the inexorable laws of\r\nfinance and trade. At the same time, in our efforts to adjust\r\ndifferences of opinion we should be free from intolerance or passion,\r\nand our judgments should be unmoved by alluring phrases and unvexed by\r\nselfish interests.\r\n\r\nI am confident that such an approach to the subject will result in\r\nprudent and effective remedial legislation. In the meantime, so far as\r\nthe executive branch of the Government can intervene, none of the powers\r\nwith which it is invested will be withheld when their exercise is deemed\r\nnecessary to maintain our national credit or avert financial disaster.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the exaggerated confidence in our country's greatness\r\nwhich tends to a disregard of the rules of national safety, another\r\ndanger confronts us not less serious. I refer to the prevalence of a\r\npopular disposition to expect from the operation of the Government\r\nespecial and direct individual advantages.\r\n\r\nThe verdict of our voters which condemned the injustice of maintaining\r\nprotection for protection's sake enjoins upon the people's servants the\r\nduty of exposing and destroying the brood of kindred evils which are the\r\nunwholesome progeny of paternalism. This is the bane of republican\r\ninstitutions and the constant peril of our government by the people. It\r\ndegrades to the purposes of wily craft the plan of rule our fathers\r\nestablished and bequeathed to us as an object of our love and\r\nveneration. It perverts the patriotic sentiments of our countrymen and\r\ntempts them to pitiful calculation of the sordid gain to be derived from\r\ntheir Government's maintenance. It undermines the self-reliance of our\r\npeople and substitutes in its place dependence upon governmental\r\nfavoritism. It stifles the spirit of true Americanism and stupefies\r\nevery ennobling trait of American citizenship.\r\n\r\nThe lessons of paternalism ought to be unlearned and the better lesson\r\ntaught that while the people should patriotically and cheerfully support\r\ntheir Government its functions do not include the support of the people.\r\n\r\nThe acceptance of this principle leads to a refusal of bounties and\r\nsubsidies, which burden the labor and thrift of a portion of our\r\ncitizens to aid ill-advised or languishing enterprises in which they\r\nhave no concern. It leads also to a challenge of wild and reckless\r\npension expenditure, which overleaps the bounds of grateful recognition\r\nof patriotic service and prostitutes to vicious uses the people's prompt\r\nand generous impulse to aid those disabled in their country's defense.\r\n\r\nEvery thoughtful American must realize the importance of checking at its\r\nbeginning any tendency in public or private station to regard frugality\r\nand economy as virtues which we may safely outgrow. The toleration of\r\nthis idea results in the waste of the people's money by their chosen\r\nservants and encourages prodigality and extravagance in the home life of\r\nour countrymen.\r\n\r\nUnder our scheme of government the waste of public money is a crime\r\nagainst the citizen, and the contempt of our people for economy and\r\nfrugality in their personal affairs deplorably saps the strength and\r\nsturdiness of our national character.\r\n\r\nIt is a plain dictate of honesty and good government that public\r\nexpenditures should be limited by public necessity, and that this should\r\nbe measured by the rules of strict economy; and it is equally clear that\r\nfrugality among the people is the best guaranty of a contented and\r\nstrong support of free institutions.\r\n\r\nOne mode of the misappropriation of public funds is avoided when\r\nappointments to office, instead of being the rewards of partisan\r\nactivity, are awarded to those whose efficiency promises a fair return\r\nof work for the compensation paid to them. To secure the fitness and\r\ncompetency of appointees to office and remove from political action the\r\ndemoralizing madness for spoils, civil-service reform has found a place\r\nin our public policy and laws. The benefits already gained through this\r\ninstrumentality and the further usefulness it promises entitle it to the\r\nhearty support and encouragement of all who desire to see our public\r\nservice well performed or who hope for the elevation of political\r\nsentiment and the purification of political methods.\r\n\r\nThe existence of immense aggregations of kindred enterprises and\r\ncombinations of business interests formed for the purpose of limiting\r\nproduction and fixing prices is inconsistent with the fair field which\r\nought to be open to every independent activity. Legitimate strife in\r\nbusiness should not be superseded by an enforced concession to the\r\ndemands of combinations that have the power to destroy, nor should the\r\npeople to be served lose the benefit of cheapness which usually results\r\nfrom wholesome competition. These aggregations and combinations\r\nfrequently constitute conspiracies against the interests of the people,\r\nand in all their phases they are unnatural and opposed to our American\r\nsense of fairness. To the extent that they can be reached and restrained\r\nby Federal power the General Government should relieve our citizens from\r\ntheir interference and exactions.\r\n\r\nLoyalty to the principles upon which our Government rests positively\r\ndemands that the equality before the law which it guarantees to every\r\ncitizen should be justly and in good faith conceded in all parts of the\r\nland. The enjoyment of this right follows the badge of citizenship\r\nwherever found, and, unimpaired by race or color, it appeals for\r\nrecognition to American manliness and fairness.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the Indians located within our border impose upon us\r\nresponsibilities we can not escape. Humanity and consistency require us\r\nto treat them with forbearance and in our dealings with them to honestly\r\nand considerately regard their rights and interests. Every effort should\r\nbe made to lead them, through the paths of civilization and education,\r\nto self-supporting and independent citizenship. In the meantime, as the\r\nnation's wards, they should be promptly defended against the cupidity of\r\ndesigning men and shielded from every influence or temptation that\r\nretards their advancement.\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States have decreed that on this day the\r\ncontrol of their Government in its legislative and executive branches\r\nshall be given to a political party pledged in the most positive terms\r\nto the accomplishment of tariff reform. They have thus determined in\r\nfavor of a more just and equitable system of Federal taxation. The\r\nagents they have chosen to carry out their purposes are bound by their\r\npromises not less than by the command of their masters to devote\r\nthemselves unremittingly to this service.\r\n\r\nWhile there should be no surrender of principle, our task must be\r\nundertaken wisely and without heedless vindictiveness. Our mission is\r\nnot punishment, but the rectification of wrong. If in lifting burdens\r\nfrom the daily life of our people we reduce inordinate and unequal\r\nadvantages too long enjoyed, this is but a necessary incident of our\r\nreturn to right and justice. If we exact from unwilling minds\r\nacquiescence in the theory of an honest distribution of the fund of the\r\ngovernmental beneficence treasured up for all, we but insist upon a\r\nprinciple which underlies our free institutions. When we tear aside the\r\ndelusions and misconceptions which have blinded our countrymen to their\r\ncondition under vicious tariff laws, we but show them how far they have\r\nbeen led away from the paths of contentment and prosperity. When we\r\nproclaim that the necessity for revenue to support the Government\r\nfurnishes the only justification for taxing the people, we announce a\r\ntruth so plain that its denial would seem to indicate the extent to\r\nwhich judgment may be influenced by familiarity with perversions of the\r\ntaxing power. And when we seek to reinstate the self-confidence and\r\nbusiness enterprise of our citizens by discrediting an abject dependence\r\nupon governmental favor, we strive to stimulate those elements of\r\nAmerican character which support the hope of American achievement.\r\n\r\nAnxiety for the redemption of the pledges which my party has made and\r\nsolicitude for the complete justification of the trust the people have\r\nreposed in us constrain me to remind those with whom I am to cooperate\r\nthat we can succeed in doing the work which has been especially set\r\nbefore us only by the most sincere, harmonious, and disinterested\r\neffort. Even if insuperable obstacles and opposition prevent the\r\nconsummation of our task, we shall hardly be excused; and if failure can\r\nbe traced to our fault or neglect we may be sure the people will hold us\r\nto a swift and exacting accountability.\r\n\r\nThe oath I now take to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of\r\nthe United States not only impressively defines the great responsibility\r\nI assume, but suggests obedience to constitutional commands as the rule\r\nby which my official conduct must be guided. I shall to the best of my\r\nability and within my sphere of duty preserve the Constitution by\r\nloyally protecting every grant of Federal power it contains, by\r\ndefending all its restraints when attacked by impatience and\r\nrestlessness, and by enforcing its limitations and reservations in favor\r\nof the States and the people.\r\n\r\nFully impressed with the gravity of the duties that confront me and\r\nmindful of my weakness, I should be appalled if it were my lot to bear\r\nunaided the responsibilities which await me. I am, however, saved from\r\ndiscouragement when I remember that I shall have the support and the\r\ncounsel and cooperation of wise and patriotic men who will stand at my\r\nside in Cabinet places or will represent the people in their legislative\r\nhalls.\r\n\r\nI find also much comfort in remembering that my countrymen are just and\r\ngenerous and in the assurance that they will not condemn those who by\r\nsincere devotion to their service deserve their forbearance and\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nAbove all, I know there is a Supreme Being who rules the affairs of men\r\nand whose goodness and mercy have always followed the American people,\r\nand I know He will not turn from us now if we humbly and reverently seek\r\nHis powerful aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MCKINLEY FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1897\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  A Civil War officer, and a Governor and Congressman\r\nfrom Ohio, Mr. McKinley took the oath on a platform erected on the north\r\nEast Front steps at the Capitol. It was administered by Chief Justice\r\nMelville Fuller. The Republican had defeated Democrat William Jennings\r\nBryan on the issue of the gold standard in the currency. Thomas Edison's\r\nnew motion picture camera captured the events, and his gramophone\r\nrecorded the address. The inaugural ball was held in the Pension\r\nBuilding.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the will of the people, and in their presence, by the\r\nauthority vested in me by this oath, I assume the arduous and\r\nresponsible duties of President of the United States, relying upon the\r\nsupport of my countrymen and invoking the guidance of Almighty God. Our\r\nfaith teaches that there is no safer reliance than upon the God of our\r\nfathers, who has so singularly favored the American people in every\r\nnational trial, and who will not forsake us so long as we obey His\r\ncommandments and walk humbly in His footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe responsibilities of the high trust to which I have been\r\ncalled--always of grave importance--are augmented by the prevailing\r\nbusiness conditions entailing idleness upon willing labor and loss to\r\nuseful enterprises. The country is suffering from industrial\r\ndisturbances from which speedy relief must be had. Our financial system\r\nneeds some revision; our money is all good now, but its value must not\r\nfurther be threatened. It should all be put upon an enduring basis, not\r\nsubject to easy attack, nor its stability to doubt or dispute. Our\r\ncurrency should continue under the supervision of the Government. The\r\nseveral forms of our paper money offer, in my judgment, a constant\r\nembarrassment to the Government and a safe balance in the Treasury.\r\nTherefore I believe it necessary to devise a system which, without\r\ndiminishing the circulating medium or offering a premium for its\r\ncontraction, will present a remedy for those arrangements which,\r\ntemporary in their nature, might well in the years of our prosperity\r\nhave been displaced by wiser provisions. With adequate revenue secured,\r\nbut not until then, we can enter upon such changes in our fiscal laws as\r\nwill, while insuring safety and volume to our money, no longer impose\r\nupon the Government the necessity of maintaining so large a gold\r\nreserve, with its attendant and inevitable temptations to speculation.\r\nMost of our financial laws are the outgrowth of experience and trial,\r\nand should not be amended without investigation and demonstration of the\r\nwisdom of the proposed changes. We must be both \"sure we are right\" and\r\n\"make haste slowly.\" If, therefore, Congress, in its wisdom, shall deem\r\nit expedient to create a commission to take under early consideration\r\nthe revision of our coinage, banking and currency laws, and give them\r\nthat exhaustive, careful and dispassionate examination that their\r\nimportance demands, I shall cordially concur in such action. If such\r\npower is vested in the President, it is my purpose to appoint a\r\ncommission of prominent, well-informed citizens of different parties,\r\nwho will command public confidence, both on account of their ability and\r\nspecial fitness for the work. Business experience and public training\r\nmay thus be combined, and the patriotic zeal of the friends of the\r\ncountry be so directed that such a report will be made as to receive the\r\nsupport of all parties, and our finances cease to be the subject of mere\r\npartisan contention. The experiment is, at all events, worth a trial,\r\nand, in my opinion, it can but prove beneficial to the entire country.\r\n\r\nThe question of international bimetallism will have early and earnest\r\nattention. It will be my constant endeavor to secure it by co-operation\r\nwith the other great commercial powers of the world. Until that\r\ncondition is realized when the parity between our gold and silver money\r\nsprings from and is supported by the relative value of the two metals,\r\nthe value of the silver already coined and of that which may hereafter\r\nbe coined, must be kept constantly at par with gold by every resource at\r\nour command. The credit of the Government, the integrity of its\r\ncurrency, and the inviolability of its obligations must be preserved.\r\nThis was the commanding verdict of the people, and it will not be\r\nunheeded.\r\n\r\nEconomy is demanded in every branch of the Government at all times, but\r\nespecially in periods, like the present, of depression in business and\r\ndistress among the people. The severest economy must be observed in all\r\npublic expenditures, and extravagance stopped wherever it is found, and\r\nprevented wherever in the future it may be developed. If the revenues\r\nare to remain as now, the only relief that can come must be from\r\ndecreased expenditures. But the present must not become the permanent\r\ncondition of the Government. It has been our uniform practice to retire,\r\nnot increase our outstanding obligations, and this policy must again be\r\nresumed and vigorously enforced. Our revenues should always be large\r\nenough to meet with ease and promptness not only our current needs and\r\nthe principal and interest of the public debt, but to make proper and\r\nliberal provision for that most deserving body of public creditors, the\r\nsoldiers and sailors and the widows and orphans who are the pensioners\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Government should not be permitted to run behind or increase its\r\ndebt in times like the present. Suitably to provide against this is the\r\nmandate of duty--the certain and easy remedy for most of our financial\r\ndifficulties. A deficiency is inevitable so long as the expenditures of\r\nthe Government exceed its receipts. It can only be met by loans or an\r\nincreased revenue. While a large annual surplus of revenue may invite\r\nwaste and extravagance, inadequate revenue creates distrust and\r\nundermines public and private credit. Neither should be encouraged.\r\nBetween more loans and more revenue there ought to be but one opinion.\r\nWe should have more revenue, and that without delay, hindrance, or\r\npostponement. A surplus in the Treasury created by loans is not a\r\npermanent or safe reliance. It will suffice while it lasts, but it can\r\nnot last long while the outlays of the Government are greater than its\r\nreceipts, as has been the case during the past two years. Nor must it be\r\nforgotten that however much such loans may temporarily relieve the\r\nsituation, the Government is still indebted for the amount of the\r\nsurplus thus accrued, which it must ultimately pay, while its ability to\r\npay is not strengthened, but weakened by a continued deficit. Loans are\r\nimperative in great emergencies to preserve the Government or its\r\ncredit, but a failure to supply needed revenue in time of peace for the\r\nmaintenance of either has no justification.\r\n\r\nThe best way for the Government to maintain its credit is to pay as it\r\ngoes--not by resorting to loans, but by keeping out of debt--through an\r\nadequate income secured by a system of taxation, external or internal,\r\nor both. It is the settled policy of the Government, pursued from the\r\nbeginning and practiced by all parties and Administrations, to raise the\r\nbulk of our revenue from taxes upon foreign productions entering the\r\nUnited States for sale and consumption, and avoiding, for the most part,\r\nevery form of direct taxation, except in time of war. The country is\r\nclearly opposed to any needless additions to the subject of internal\r\ntaxation, and is committed by its latest popular utterance to the system\r\nof tariff taxation. There can be no misunderstanding, either, about the\r\nprinciple upon which this tariff taxation shall be levied. Nothing has\r\never been made plainer at a general election than that the controlling\r\nprinciple in the raising of revenue from duties on imports is zealous\r\ncare for American interests and American labor. The people have declared\r\nthat such legislation should be had as will give ample protection and\r\nencouragement to the industries and the development of our country. It\r\nis, therefore, earnestly hoped and expected that Congress will, at the\r\nearliest practicable moment, enact revenue legislation that shall be\r\nfair, reasonable, conservative, and just, and which, while supplying\r\nsufficient revenue for public purposes, will still be signally\r\nbeneficial and helpful to every section and every enterprise of the\r\npeople. To this policy we are all, of whatever party, firmly bound by\r\nthe voice of the people--a power vastly more potential than the\r\nexpression of any political platform. The paramount duty of Congress is\r\nto stop deficiencies by the restoration of that protective legislation\r\nwhich has always been the firmest prop of the Treasury. The passage of\r\nsuch a law or laws would strengthen the credit of the Government both at\r\nhome and abroad, and go far toward stopping the drain upon the gold\r\nreserve held for the redemption of our currency, which has been heavy\r\nand well-nigh constant for several years.\r\n\r\nIn the revision of the tariff especial attention should be given to the\r\nre-enactment and extension of the reciprocity principle of the law of\r\n1890, under which so great a stimulus was given to our foreign trade in\r\nnew and advantageous markets for our surplus agricultural and\r\nmanufactured products. The brief trial given this legislation amply\r\njustifies a further experiment and additional discretionary power in the\r\nmaking of commercial treaties, the end in view always to be the opening\r\nup of new markets for the products of our country, by granting\r\nconcessions to the products of other lands that we need and cannot\r\nproduce ourselves, and which do not involve any loss of labor to our own\r\npeople, but tend to increase their employment.\r\n\r\nThe depression of the past four years has fallen with especial severity\r\nupon the great body of toilers of the country, and upon none more than\r\nthe holders of small farms. Agriculture has languished and labor\r\nsuffered. The revival of manufacturing will be a relief to both. No\r\nportion of our population is more devoted to the institution of free\r\ngovernment nor more loyal in their support, while none bears more\r\ncheerfully or fully its proper share in the maintenance of the\r\nGovernment or is better entitled to its wise and liberal care and\r\nprotection. Legislation helpful to producers is beneficial to all. The\r\ndepressed condition of industry on the farm and in the mine and factory\r\nhas lessened the ability of the people to meet the demands upon them,\r\nand they rightfully expect that not only a system of revenue shall be\r\nestablished that will secure the largest income with the least burden,\r\nbut that every means will be taken to decrease, rather than increase,\r\nour public expenditures. Business conditions are not the most promising.\r\nIt will take time to restore the prosperity of former years. If we\r\ncannot promptly attain it, we can resolutely turn our faces in that\r\ndirection and aid its return by friendly legislation. However\r\ntroublesome the situation may appear, Congress will not, I am sure, be\r\nfound lacking in disposition or ability to relieve it as far as\r\nlegislation can do so. The restoration of confidence and the revival of\r\nbusiness, which men of all parties so much desire, depend more largely\r\nupon the prompt, energetic, and intelligent action of Congress than upon\r\nany other single agency affecting the situation.\r\n\r\nIt is inspiring, too, to remember that no great emergency in the one\r\nhundred and eight years of our eventful national life has ever arisen\r\nthat has not been met with wisdom and courage by the American people,\r\nwith fidelity to their best interests and highest destiny, and to the\r\nhonor of the American name. These years of glorious history have exalted\r\nmankind and advanced the cause of freedom throughout the world, and\r\nimmeasurably strengthened the precious free institutions which we enjoy.\r\nThe people love and will sustain these institutions. The great essential\r\nto our happiness and prosperity is that we adhere to the principles upon\r\nwhich the Government was established and insist upon their faithful\r\nobservance. Equality of rights must prevail, and our laws be always and\r\neverywhere respected and obeyed. We may have failed in the discharge of\r\nour full duty as citizens of the great Republic, but it is consoling and\r\nencouraging to realize that free speech, a free press, free thought,\r\nfree schools, the free and unmolested right of religious liberty and\r\nworship, and free and fair elections are dearer and more universally\r\nenjoyed to-day than ever before. These guaranties must be sacredly\r\npreserved and wisely strengthened. The constituted authorities must be\r\ncheerfully and vigorously upheld. Lynchings must not be tolerated in a\r\ngreat and civilized country like the United States; courts, not mobs,\r\nmust execute the penalties of the law. The preservation of public order,\r\nthe right of discussion, the integrity of courts, and the orderly\r\nadministration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety upon\r\nwhich our Government securely rests.\r\n\r\nOne of the lessons taught by the late election, which all can rejoice\r\nin, is that the citizens of the United States are both law-respecting\r\nand law-abiding people, not easily swerved from the path of patriotism\r\nand honor. This is in entire accord with the genius of our institutions,\r\nand but emphasizes the advantages of inculcating even a greater love for\r\nlaw and order in the future. Immunity should be granted to none who\r\nviolate the laws, whether individuals, corporations, or communities; and\r\nas the Constitution imposes upon the President the duty of both its own\r\nexecution, and of the statutes enacted in pursuance of its provisions, I\r\nshall endeavor carefully to carry them into effect. The declaration of\r\nthe party now restored to power has been in the past that of \"opposition\r\nto all combinations of capital organized in trusts, or otherwise, to\r\ncontrol arbitrarily the condition of trade among our citizens,\" and it\r\nhas supported \"such legislation as will prevent the execution of all\r\nschemes to oppress the people by undue charges on their supplies, or by\r\nunjust rates for the transportation of their products to the market.\"\r\nThis purpose will be steadily pursued, both by the enforcement of the\r\nlaws now in existence and the recommendation and support of such new\r\nstatutes as may be necessary to carry it into effect.\r\n\r\nOur naturalization and immigration laws should be further improved to\r\nthe constant promotion of a safer, a better, and a higher citizenship. A\r\ngrave peril to the Republic would be a citizenship too ignorant to\r\nunderstand or too vicious to appreciate the great value and beneficence\r\nof our institutions and laws, and against all who come here to make war\r\nupon them our gates must be promptly and tightly closed. Nor must we be\r\nunmindful of the need of improvement among our own citizens, but with\r\nthe zeal of our forefathers encourage the spread of knowledge and free\r\neducation. Illiteracy must be banished from the land if we shall attain\r\nthat high destiny as the foremost of the enlightened nations of the\r\nworld which, under Providence, we ought to achieve.\r\n\r\nReforms in the civil service must go on; but the changes should be real\r\nand genuine, not perfunctory, or prompted by a zeal in behalf of any\r\nparty simply because it happens to be in power. As a member of Congress\r\nI voted and spoke in favor of the present law, and I shall attempt its\r\nenforcement in the spirit in which it was enacted. The purpose in view\r\nwas to secure the most efficient service of the best men who would\r\naccept appointment under the Government, retaining faithful and devoted\r\npublic servants in office, but shielding none, under the authority of\r\nany rule or custom, who are inefficient, incompetent, or unworthy. The\r\nbest interests of the country demand this, and the people heartily\r\napprove the law wherever and whenever it has been thus administrated.\r\n\r\nCongress should give prompt attention to the restoration of our American\r\nmerchant marine, once the pride of the seas in all the great ocean\r\nhighways of commerce. To my mind, few more important subjects so\r\nimperatively demand its intelligent consideration. The United States has\r\nprogressed with marvelous rapidity in every field of enterprise and\r\nendeavor until we have become foremost in nearly all the great lines of\r\ninland trade, commerce, and industry. Yet, while this is true, our\r\nAmerican merchant marine has been steadily declining until it is now\r\nlower, both in the percentage of tonnage and the number of vessels\r\nemployed, than it was prior to the Civil War. Commendable progress has\r\nbeen made of late years in the upbuilding of the American Navy, but we\r\nmust supplement these efforts by providing as a proper consort for it a\r\nmerchant marine amply sufficient for our own carrying trade to foreign\r\ncountries. The question is one that appeals both to our business\r\nnecessities and the patriotic aspirations of a great people.\r\n\r\nIt has been the policy of the United States since the foundation of the\r\nGovernment to cultivate relations of peace and amity with all the\r\nnations of the world, and this accords with my conception of our duty\r\nnow. We have cherished the policy of non-interference with affairs of\r\nforeign governments wisely inaugurated by Washington, keeping ourselves\r\nfree from entanglement, either as allies or foes, content to leave\r\nundisturbed with them the settlement of their own domestic concerns. It\r\nwill be our aim to pursue a firm and dignified foreign policy, which\r\nshall be just, impartial, ever watchful of our national honor, and\r\nalways insisting upon the enforcement of the lawful rights of American\r\ncitizens everywhere. Our diplomacy should seek nothing more and accept\r\nnothing less than is due us. We want no wars of conquest; we must avoid\r\nthe temptation of territorial aggression. War should never be entered\r\nupon until every agency of peace has failed; peace is preferable to war\r\nin almost every contingency. Arbitration is the true method of\r\nsettlement of international as well as local or individual differences.\r\nIt was recognized as the best means of adjustment of differences between\r\nemployers and employees by the Forty-ninth Congress, in 1886, and its\r\napplication was extended to our diplomatic relations by the unanimous\r\nconcurrence of the Senate and House of the Fifty-first Congress in 1890.\r\nThe latter resolution was accepted as the basis of negotiations with us\r\nby the British House of Commons in 1893, and upon our invitation a\r\ntreaty of arbitration between the United States and Great Britain was\r\nsigned at Washington and transmitted to the Senate for its ratification\r\nin January last. Since this treaty is clearly the result of our own\r\ninitiative; since it has been recognized as the leading feature of our\r\nforeign policy throughout our entire national history--the adjustment of\r\ndifficulties by judicial methods rather than force of arms--and since it\r\npresents to the world the glorious example of reason and peace, not\r\npassion and war, controlling the relations between two of the greatest\r\nnations in the world, an example certain to be followed by others, I\r\nrespectfully urge the early action of the Senate thereon, not merely as\r\na matter of policy, but as a duty to mankind. The importance and moral\r\ninfluence of the ratification of such a treaty can hardly be\r\noverestimated in the cause of advancing civilization. It may well engage\r\nthe best thought of the statesmen and people of every country, and I\r\ncannot but consider it fortunate that it was reserved to the United\r\nStates to have the leadership in so grand a work.\r\n\r\nIt has been the uniform practice of each President to avoid, as far as\r\npossible, the convening of Congress in extraordinary session. It is an\r\nexample which, under ordinary circumstances and in the absence of a\r\npublic necessity, is to be commended. But a failure to convene the\r\nrepresentatives of the people in Congress in extra session when it\r\ninvolves neglect of a public duty places the responsibility of such\r\nneglect upon the Executive himself. The condition of the public\r\nTreasury, as has been indicated, demands the immediate consideration of\r\nCongress. It alone has the power to provide revenues for the Government.\r\nNot to convene it under such circumstances I can view in no other sense\r\nthan the neglect of a plain duty. I do not sympathize with the sentiment\r\nthat Congress in session is dangerous to our general business interests.\r\nIts members are the agents of the people, and their presence at the seat\r\nof Government in the execution of the sovereign will should not operate\r\nas an injury, but a benefit. There could be no better time to put the\r\nGovernment upon a sound financial and economic basis than now. The\r\npeople have only recently voted that this should be done, and nothing is\r\nmore binding upon the agents of their will than the obligation of\r\nimmediate action. It has always seemed to me that the postponement of\r\nthe meeting of Congress until more than a year after it has been chosen\r\ndeprived Congress too often of the inspiration of the popular will and\r\nthe country of the corresponding benefits. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat to postpone action in the presence of so great a necessity would be\r\nunwise on the part of the Executive because unjust to the interests of\r\nthe people. Our action now will be freer from mere partisan\r\nconsideration than if the question of tariff revision was postponed\r\nuntil the regular session of Congress. We are nearly two years from a\r\nCongressional election, and politics cannot so greatly distract us as if\r\nsuch contest was immediately pending. We can approach the problem calmly\r\nand patriotically, without fearing its effect upon an early election.\r\n\r\nOur fellow-citizens who may disagree with us upon the character of this\r\nlegislation prefer to have the question settled now, even against their\r\npreconceived views, and perhaps settled so reasonably, as I trust and\r\nbelieve it will be, as to insure great permanence, than to have further\r\nuncertainty menacing the vast and varied business interests of the\r\nUnited States. Again, whatever action Congress may take will be given a\r\nfair opportunity for trial before the people are called to pass judgment\r\nupon it, and this I consider a great essential to the rightful and\r\nlasting settlement of the question. In view of these considerations, I\r\nshall deem it my duty as President to convene Congress in extraordinary\r\nsession on Monday, the 15th day of March, 1897.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I congratulate the country upon the fraternal spirit of\r\nthe people and the manifestations of good will everywhere so apparent.\r\nThe recent election not only most fortunately demonstrated the\r\nobliteration of sectional or geographical lines, but to some extent also\r\nthe prejudices which for years have distracted our councils and marred\r\nour true greatness as a nation. The triumph of the people, whose verdict\r\nis carried into effect today, is not the triumph of one section, nor\r\nwholly of one party, but of all sections and all the people. The North\r\nand the South no longer divide on the old lines, but upon principles and\r\npolicies; and in this fact surely every lover of the country can find\r\ncause for true felicitation.\r\n\r\nLet us rejoice in and cultivate this spirit; it is ennobling and will be\r\nboth a gain and a blessing to our beloved country. It will be my\r\nconstant aim to do nothing, and permit nothing to be done, that will\r\narrest or disturb this growing sentiment of unity and cooperation, this\r\nrevival of esteem and affiliation which now animates so many thousands\r\nin both the old antagonistic sections, but I shall cheerfully do\r\neverything possible to promote and increase it.\r\n\r\nLet me again repeat the words of the oath administered by the Chief\r\nJustice which, in their respective spheres, so far as applicable, I\r\nwould have all my countrymen observe: \"I will faithfully execute the\r\noffice of President of the United States, and will, to the best of my\r\nability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\" This is the obligation I have reverently taken before the Lord\r\nMost High. To keep it will be my single purpose, my constant prayer; and\r\nI shall confidently rely upon the forbearance and assistance of all the\r\npeople in the discharge of my solemn responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MCKINLEY, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MARCH 4, 1901\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The second inauguration was a patriotic celebration\r\nof the successes of the recently concluded Spanish American War. The new\r\nVice President, Theodore Roosevelt, was a popular figure from the War.\r\nPresident McKinley again had defeated William Jennings Bryan, but the\r\ncampaign issue was American expansionism overseas. Chief Justice\r\nMelville Fuller administered the oath of office on a covered platform\r\nerected in front of the East Portico of the Capitol. The parade featured\r\nsoldiers from the campaigns in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines.\r\nAn inaugural ball was held that evening in the Pension Building.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nWhen we assembled here on the 4th of March, 1897, there was great\r\nanxiety with regard to our currency and credit. None exists now. Then\r\nour Treasury receipts were inadequate to meet the current obligations of\r\nthe Government. Now they are sufficient for all public needs, and we\r\nhave a surplus instead of a deficit. Then I felt constrained to convene\r\nthe Congress in extraordinary session to devise revenues to pay the\r\nordinary expenses of the Government. Now I have the satisfaction to\r\nannounce that the Congress just closed has reduced taxation in the sum\r\nof $41,000,000. Then there was deep solicitude because of the long\r\ndepression in our manufacturing, mining, agricultural, and mercantile\r\nindustries and the consequent distress of our laboring population. Now\r\nevery avenue of production is crowded with activity, labor is well\r\nemployed, and American products find good markets at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nOur diversified productions, however, are increasing in such\r\nunprecedented volume as to admonish us of the necessity of still further\r\nenlarging our foreign markets by broader commercial relations. For this\r\npurpose reciprocal trade arrangements with other nations should in\r\nliberal spirit be carefully cultivated and promoted.\r\n\r\nThe national verdict of 1896 has for the most part been executed.\r\nWhatever remains unfulfilled is a continuing obligation resting with\r\nundiminished force upon the Executive and the Congress. But fortunate as\r\nour condition is, its permanence can only be assured by sound business\r\nmethods and strict economy in national administration and legislation.\r\nWe should not permit our great prosperity to lead us to reckless\r\nventures in business or profligacy in public expenditures. While the\r\nCongress determines the objects and the sum of appropriations, the\r\nofficials of the executive departments are responsible for honest and\r\nfaithful disbursement, and it should be their constant care to avoid\r\nwaste and extravagance.\r\n\r\nHonesty, capacity, and industry are nowhere more indispensable than in\r\npublic employment. These should be fundamental requisites to original\r\nappointment and the surest guaranties against removal.\r\n\r\nFour years ago we stood on the brink of war without the people knowing\r\nit and without any preparation or effort at preparation for the\r\nimpending peril. I did all that in honor could be done to avert the war,\r\nbut without avail. It became inevitable; and the Congress at its first\r\nregular session, without party division, provided money in anticipation\r\nof the crisis and in preparation to meet it. It came. The result was\r\nsignally favorable to American arms and in the highest degree honorable\r\nto the Government. It imposed upon us obligations from which we cannot\r\nescape and from which it would be dishonorable to seek escape. We are\r\nnow at peace with the world, and it is my fervent prayer that if\r\ndifferences arise between us and other powers they may be settled by\r\npeaceful arbitration and that hereafter we may be spared the horrors of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIntrusted by the people for a second time with the office of President,\r\nI enter upon its administration appreciating the great responsibilities\r\nwhich attach to this renewed honor and commission, promising unreserved\r\ndevotion on my part to their faithful discharge and reverently invoking\r\nfor my guidance the direction and favor of Almighty God. I should shrink\r\nfrom the duties this day assumed if I did not feel that in their\r\nperformance I should have the co-operation of the wise and patriotic men\r\nof all parties. It encourages me for the great task which I now\r\nundertake to believe that those who voluntarily committed to me the\r\ntrust imposed upon the Chief Executive of the Republic will give to me\r\ngenerous support in my duties to \"preserve, protect, and defend, the\r\nConstitution of the United States\" and to \"care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed.\" The national purpose is indicated through a\r\nnational election. It is the constitutional method of ascertaining the\r\npublic will. When once it is registered it is a law to us all, and\r\nfaithful observance should follow its decrees.\r\n\r\nStrong hearts and helpful hands are needed, and, fortunately, we have\r\nthem in every part of our beloved country. We are reunited. Sectionalism\r\nhas disappeared. Division on public questions can no longer be traced by\r\nthe war maps of 1861. These old differences less and less disturb the\r\njudgment. Existing problems demand the thought and quicken the\r\nconscience of the country, and the responsibility for their presence, as\r\nwell as for their righteous settlement, rests upon us all--no more upon\r\nme than upon you. There are some national questions in the solution of\r\nwhich patriotism should exclude partisanship. Magnifying their\r\ndifficulties will not take them off our hands nor facilitate their\r\nadjustment. Distrust of the capacity, integrity, and high purposes of\r\nthe American people will not be an inspiring theme for future political\r\ncontests. Dark pictures and gloomy forebodings are worse than useless.\r\nThese only becloud, they do not help to point the way of safety and\r\nhonor. \"Hope maketh not ashamed.\" The prophets of evil were not the\r\nbuilders of the Republic, nor in its crises since have they saved or\r\nserved it. The faith of the fathers was a mighty force in its creation,\r\nand the faith of their descendants has wrought its progress and\r\nfurnished its defenders. They are obstructionists who despair, and who\r\nwould destroy confidence in the ability of our people to solve wisely\r\nand for civilization the mighty problems resting upon them. The American\r\npeople, intrenched in freedom at home, take their love for it with them\r\nwherever they go, and they reject as mistaken and unworthy the doctrine\r\nthat we lose our own liberties by securing the enduring foundations of\r\nliberty to others. Our institutions will not deteriorate by extension,\r\nand our sense of justice will not abate under tropic suns in distant\r\nseas. As heretofore, so hereafter will the nation demonstrate its\r\nfitness to administer any new estate which events devolve upon it, and\r\nin the fear of God will \"take occasion by the hand and make the bounds\r\nof freedom wider yet.\" If there are those among us who would make our\r\nway more difficult, we must not be disheartened, but the more earnestly\r\ndedicate ourselves to the task upon which we have rightly entered. The\r\npath of progress is seldom smooth. New things are often found hard to\r\ndo. Our fathers found them so. We find them so. They are inconvenient.\r\nThey cost us something. But are we not made better for the effort and\r\nsacrifice, and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed?\r\n\r\nWe will be consoled, too, with the fact that opposition has confronted\r\nevery onward movement of the Republic from its opening hour until now,\r\nbut without success. The Republic has marched on and on, and its step\r\nhas exalted freedom and humanity. We are undergoing the same ordeal as\r\ndid our predecessors nearly a century ago. We are following the course\r\nthey blazed. They triumphed. Will their successors falter and plead\r\norganic impotency in the nation? Surely after 125 years of achievement\r\nfor mankind we will not now surrender our equality with other powers on\r\nmatters fundamental and essential to nationality. With no such purpose\r\nwas the nation created. In no such spirit has it developed its full and\r\nindependent sovereignty. We adhere to the principle of equality among\r\nourselves, and by no act of ours will we assign to ourselves a\r\nsubordinate rank in the family of nations.\r\n\r\nMy fellow-citizens, the public events of the past four years have gone\r\ninto history. They are too near to justify recital. Some of them were\r\nunforeseen; many of them momentous and far-reaching in their\r\nconsequences to ourselves and our relations with the rest of the world.\r\nThe part which the United States bore so honorably in the thrilling\r\nscenes in China, while new to American life, has been in harmony with\r\nits true spirit and best traditions, and in dealing with the results its\r\npolicy will be that of moderation and fairness.\r\n\r\nWe face at this moment a most important question that of the future\r\nrelations of the United States and Cuba. With our near neighbors we must\r\nremain close friends. The declaration of the purposes of this Government\r\nin the resolution of April 20, 1898, must be made good. Ever since the\r\nevacuation of the island by the army of Spain, the Executive, with all\r\npracticable speed, has been assisting its people in the successive steps\r\nnecessary to the establishment of a free and independent government\r\nprepared to assume and perform the obligations of international law\r\nwhich now rest upon the United States under the treaty of Paris. The\r\nconvention elected by the people to frame a constitution is approaching\r\nthe completion of its labors. The transfer of American control to the\r\nnew government is of such great importance, involving an obligation\r\nresulting from our intervention and the treaty of peace, that I am glad\r\nto be advised by the recent act of Congress of the policy which the\r\nlegislative branch of the Government deems essential to the best\r\ninterests of Cuba and the United States. The principles which led to our\r\nintervention require that the fundamental law upon which the new\r\ngovernment rests should be adapted to secure a government capable of\r\nperforming the duties and discharging the functions of a separate\r\nnation, of observing its international obligations of protecting life\r\nand property, insuring order, safety, and liberty, and conforming to the\r\nestablished and historical policy of the United States in its relation\r\nto Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe peace which we are pledged to leave to the Cuban people must carry\r\nwith it the guaranties of permanence. We became sponsors for the\r\npacification of the island, and we remain accountable to the Cubans, no\r\nless than to our own country and people, for the reconstruction of Cuba\r\nas a free commonwealth on abiding foundations of right, justice,\r\nliberty, and assured order. Our enfranchisement of the people will not\r\nbe completed until free Cuba shall \"be a reality, not a name; a perfect\r\nentity, not a hasty experiment bearing within itself the elements of\r\nfailure.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the treaty of peace with Spain was ratified on the 6th of\r\nFebruary, 1899, and ratifications were exchanged nearly two years ago,\r\nthe Congress has indicated no form of government for the Philippine\r\nIslands. It has, however, provided an army to enable the Executive to\r\nsuppress insurrection, restore peace, give security to the inhabitants,\r\nand establish the authority of the United States throughout the\r\narchipelago. It has authorized the organization of native troops as\r\nauxiliary to the regular force. It has been advised from time to time of\r\nthe acts of the military and naval officers in the islands, of my action\r\nin appointing civil commissions, of the instructions with which they\r\nwere charged, of their duties and powers, of their recommendations, and\r\nof their several acts under executive commission, together with the very\r\ncomplete general information they have submitted. These reports fully\r\nset forth the conditions, past and present, in the islands, and the\r\ninstructions clearly show the principles which will guide the Executive\r\nuntil the Congress shall, as it is required to do by the treaty,\r\ndetermine \"the civil rights and political status of the native\r\ninhabitants.\" The Congress having added the sanction of its authority to\r\nthe powers already possessed and exercised by the Executive under the\r\nConstitution, thereby leaving with the Executive the responsibility for\r\nthe government of the Philippines, I shall continue the efforts already\r\nbegun until order shall be restored throughout the islands, and as fast\r\nas conditions permit will establish local governments, in the formation\r\nof which the full co-operation of the people has been already invited,\r\nand when established will encourage the people to administer them. The\r\nsettled purpose, long ago proclaimed, to afford the inhabitants of the\r\nislands self-government as fast as they were ready for it will be\r\npursued with earnestness and fidelity. Already something has been\r\naccomplished in this direction. The Government's representatives, civil\r\nand military, are doing faithful and noble work in their mission of\r\nemancipation and merit the approval and support of their countrymen. The\r\nmost liberal terms of amnesty have already been communicated to the\r\ninsurgents, and the way is still open for those who have raised their\r\narms against the Government for honorable submission to its authority.\r\nOur countrymen should not be deceived. We are not waging war against the\r\ninhabitants of the Philippine Islands. A portion of them are making war\r\nagainst the United States. By far the greater part of the inhabitants\r\nrecognize American sovereignty and welcome it as a guaranty of order and\r\nof security for life, property, liberty, freedom of conscience, and the\r\npursuit of happiness. To them full protection will be given. They shall\r\nnot be abandoned. We will not leave the destiny of the loyal millions\r\nthe islands to the disloyal thousands who are in rebellion against the\r\nUnited States. Order under civil institutions will come as soon as those\r\nwho now break the peace shall keep it. Force will not be needed or used\r\nwhen those who make war against us shall make it no more. May it end\r\nwithout further bloodshed, and there be ushered in the reign of peace to\r\nbe made permanent by a government of liberty under law!\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The energetic Republican President had taken his\r\nfirst oath of office upon the death of President McKinley, who died of\r\nan assassin's gunshot wounds on September 14, 1901. Mr. Roosevelt had\r\nbeen President himself for three years at the election of 1904. The\r\ninaugural celebration was the largest and most diverse of any in\r\nmemory--cowboys, Indians (including the Apache Chief Geronimo), coal\r\nminers, soldiers, and students were some of the groups represented. The\r\noath of office was administered on the East Portico of the Capitol by\r\nChief Justice Melville Fuller.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fellow-citizens, no people on earth have more cause to be thankful\r\nthan ours, and this is said reverently, in no spirit of boastfulness in\r\nour own strength, but with gratitude to the Giver of Good who has\r\nblessed us with the conditions which have enabled us to achieve so large\r\na measure of well-being and of happiness. To us as a people it has been\r\ngranted to lay the foundations of our national life in a new continent.\r\nWe are the heirs of the ages, and yet we have had to pay few of the\r\npenalties which in old countries are exacted by the dead hand of a\r\nbygone civilization. We have not been obliged to fight for our existence\r\nagainst any alien race; and yet our life has called for the vigor and\r\neffort without which the manlier and hardier virtues wither away. Under\r\nsuch conditions it would be our own fault if we failed; and the success\r\nwhich we have had in the past, the success which we confidently believe\r\nthe future will bring, should cause in us no feeling of vainglory, but\r\nrather a deep and abiding realization of all which life has offered us;\r\na full acknowledgment of the responsibility which is ours; and a fixed\r\ndetermination to show that under a free government a mighty people can\r\nthrive best, alike as regards the things of the body and the things of\r\nthe soul.\r\n\r\nMuch has been given us, and much will rightfully be expected from us. We\r\nhave duties to others and duties to ourselves; and we can shirk neither.\r\nWe have become a great nation, forced by the fact of its greatness into\r\nrelations with the other nations of the earth, and we must behave as\r\nbeseems a people with such responsibilities. Toward all other nations,\r\nlarge and small, our attitude must be one of cordial and sincere\r\nfriendship. We must show not only in our words, but in our deeds, that\r\nwe are earnestly desirous of securing their good will by acting toward\r\nthem in a spirit of just and generous recognition of all their rights.\r\nBut justice and generosity in a nation, as in an individual, count most\r\nwhen shown not by the weak but by the strong. While ever careful to\r\nrefrain from wrongdoing others, we must be no less insistent that we are\r\nnot wronged ourselves. We wish peace, but we wish the peace of justice,\r\nthe peace of righteousness. We wish it because we think it is right and\r\nnot because we are afraid. No weak nation that acts manfully and justly\r\nshould ever have cause to fear us, and no strong power should ever be\r\nable to single us out as a subject for insolent aggression.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the other powers of the world are important; but\r\nstill more important are our relations among ourselves. Such growth in\r\nwealth, in population, and in power as this nation has seen during the\r\ncentury and a quarter of its national life is inevitably accompanied by\r\na like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation that\r\nrises to greatness. Power invariably means both responsibility and\r\ndanger. Our forefathers faced certain perils which we have outgrown. We\r\nnow face other perils, the very existence of which it was impossible\r\nthat they should foresee. Modern life is both complex and intense, and\r\nthe tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial\r\ndevelopment of the last half century are felt in every fiber of our\r\nsocial and political being. Never before have men tried so vast and\r\nformidable an experiment as that of administering the affairs of a\r\ncontinent under the forms of a Democratic republic. The conditions which\r\nhave told for our marvelous material well-being, which have developed\r\nto a very high degree our energy, self-reliance, and individual\r\ninitiative, have also brought the care and anxiety inseparable from the\r\naccumulation of great wealth in industrial centers. Upon the success of\r\nour experiment much depends, not only as regards our own welfare, but as\r\nregards the welfare of mankind. If we fail, the cause of free\r\nself-government throughout the world will rock to its foundations, and\r\ntherefore our responsibility is heavy, to ourselves, to the world as it\r\nis to-day, and to the generations yet unborn. There is no good reason\r\nwhy we should fear the future, but there is every reason why we should\r\nface it seriously, neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the\r\nproblems before us nor fearing to approach these problems with the\r\nunbending, unflinching purpose to solve them aright.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, though the problems are new, though the tasks set before\r\nus differ from the tasks set before our fathers who founded and\r\npreserved this Republic, the spirit in which these tasks must be\r\nundertaken and these problems faced, if our duty is to be well done,\r\nremains essentially unchanged. We know that self-government is\r\ndifficult. We know that no people needs such high traits of character as\r\nthat people which seeks to govern its affairs aright through the freely\r\nexpressed will of the freemen who compose it. But we have faith that we\r\nshall not prove false to the memories of the men of the mighty past.\r\nThey did their work, they left us the splendid heritage we now enjoy. We\r\nin our turn have an assured confidence that we shall be able to leave\r\nthis heritage unwasted and enlarged to our children and our children's\r\nchildren. To do so we must show, not merely in great crises, but in the\r\neveryday affairs of life, the qualities of practical intelligence, of\r\ncourage, of hardihood, and endurance, and above all the power of\r\ndevotion to a lofty ideal, which made great the men who founded this\r\nRepublic in the days of Washington, which made great the men who\r\npreserved this Republic in the days of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HOWARD TAFT, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 4, 1909\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  A blizzard the night before caused the ceremonies to\r\nbe moved into the Senate Chamber in the Capitol. The oath of office was\r\nadministered for the sixth time by Chief Justice Melville Fuller. The\r\nnew President took his oath on the Supreme Court Bible, which he used\r\nagain in 1921 to take his oaths as the Chief Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt. An inaugural ball that evening was held at the Pension Building.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow-Citizens:\r\n\r\nAnyone who has taken the oath I have just taken must feel a heavy weight\r\nof responsibility. If not, he has no conception of the powers and duties\r\nof the office upon which he is about to enter, or he is lacking in a\r\nproper sense of the obligation which the oath imposes.\r\n\r\nThe office of an inaugural address is to give a summary outline of the\r\nmain policies of the new administration, so far as they can be\r\nanticipated. I have had the honor to be one of the advisers of my\r\ndistinguished predecessor, and, as such, to hold up his hands in the\r\nreforms he has initiated. I should be untrue to myself, to my promises,\r\nand to the declarations of the party platform upon which I was elected\r\nto office, if I did not make the maintenance and enforcement of those\r\nreforms a most important feature of my administration. They were\r\ndirected to the suppression of the lawlessness and abuses of power of\r\nthe great combinations of capital invested in railroads and in\r\nindustrial enterprises carrying on interstate commerce. The steps which\r\nmy predecessor took and the legislation passed on his recommendation\r\nhave accomplished much, have caused a general halt in the vicious\r\npolicies which created popular alarm, and have brought about in the\r\nbusiness affected a much higher regard for existing law.\r\n\r\nTo render the reforms lasting, however, and to secure at the same time\r\nfreedom from alarm on the part of those pursuing proper and progressive\r\nbusiness methods, further legislative and executive action are needed.\r\nRelief of the railroads from certain restrictions of the antitrust law\r\nhave been urged by my predecessor and will be urged by me. On the other\r\nhand, the administration is pledged to legislation looking to a proper\r\nfederal supervision and restriction to prevent excessive issues of bonds\r\nand stock by companies owning and operating interstate commerce\r\nrailroads.\r\n\r\nThen, too, a reorganization of the Department of Justice, of the Bureau\r\nof Corporations in the Department of Commerce and Labor, and of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, looking to effective cooperation of\r\nthese agencies, is needed to secure a more rapid and certain enforcement\r\nof the laws affecting interstate railroads and industrial combinations.\r\n\r\nI hope to be able to submit at the first regular session of the incoming\r\nCongress, in December next, definite suggestions in respect to the\r\nneeded amendments to the antitrust and the interstate commerce law and\r\nthe changes required in the executive departments concerned in their\r\nenforcement.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that with the changes to be recommended American business\r\ncan be assured of that measure of stability and certainty in respect to\r\nthose things that may be done and those that are prohibited which is\r\nessential to the life and growth of all business. Such a plan must\r\ninclude the right of the people to avail themselves of those methods of\r\ncombining capital and effort deemed necessary to reach the highest\r\ndegree of economic efficiency, at the same time differentiating between\r\ncombinations based upon legitimate economic reasons and those formed\r\nwith the intent of creating monopolies and artificially controlling\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nThe work of formulating into practical shape such changes is creative\r\nword of the highest order, and requires all the deliberation possible in\r\nthe interval. I believe that the amendments to be proposed are just as\r\nnecessary in the protection of legitimate business as in the clinching\r\nof the reforms which properly bear the name of my predecessor.\r\n\r\nA matter of most pressing importance is the revision of the tariff. In\r\naccordance with the promises of the platform upon which I was elected, I\r\nshall call Congress into extra session to meet on the 15th day of March,\r\nin order that consideration may be at once given to a bill revising the\r\nDingley Act. This should secure an adequate revenue and adjust the\r\nduties in such a manner as to afford to labor and to all industries in\r\nthis country, whether of the farm, mine or factory, protection by tariff\r\nequal to the difference between the cost of production abroad and the\r\ncost of production here, and have a provision which shall put into\r\nforce, upon executive determination of certain facts, a higher or\r\nmaximum tariff against those countries whose trade policy toward us\r\nequitably requires such discrimination. It is thought that there has\r\nbeen such a change in conditions since the enactment of the Dingley Act,\r\ndrafted on a similarly protective principle, that the measure of the\r\ntariff above stated will permit the reduction of rates in certain\r\nschedules and will require the advancement of few, if any.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to revise the tariff made in such an authoritative way as\r\nto lead the business community to count upon it necessarily halts all\r\nthose branches of business directly affected; and as these are most\r\nimportant, it disturbs the whole business of the country. It is\r\nimperatively necessary, therefore, that a tariff bill be drawn in good\r\nfaith in accordance with promises made before the election by the party\r\nin power, and as promptly passed as due consideration will permit. It is\r\nnot that the tariff is more important in the long run than the\r\nperfecting of the reforms in respect to antitrust legislation and\r\ninterstate commerce regulation, but the need for action when the\r\nrevision of the tariff has been determined upon is more immediate to\r\navoid embarrassment of business. To secure the needed speed in the\r\npassage of the tariff bill, it would seem wise to attempt no other\r\nlegislation at the extra session. I venture this as a suggestion only,\r\nfor the course to be taken by Congress, upon the call of the Executive,\r\nis wholly within its discretion.\r\n\r\nIn the mailing of a tariff bill the prime motive is taxation and the\r\nsecuring thereby of a revenue. Due largely to the business depression\r\nwhich followed the financial panic of 1907, the revenue from customs and\r\nother sources has decreased to such an extent that the expenditures for\r\nthe current fiscal year will exceed the receipts by $100,000,000. It is\r\nimperative that such a deficit shall not continue, and the framers of\r\nthe tariff bill must, of course, have in mind the total revenues likely\r\nto be produced by it and so arrange the duties as to secure an adequate\r\nincome. Should it be impossible to do so by import duties, new kinds of\r\ntaxation must be adopted, and among these I recommend a graduated\r\ninheritance tax as correct in principle and as certain and easy of\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nThe obligation on the part of those responsible for the expenditures\r\nmade to carry on the Government, to be as economical as possible, and to\r\nmake the burden of taxation as light as possible, is plain, and should\r\nbe affirmed in every declaration of government policy. This is\r\nespecially true when we are face to face with a heavy deficit. But when\r\nthe desire to win the popular approval leads to the cutting off of\r\nexpenditures really needed to make the Government effective and to\r\nenable it to accomplish its proper objects, the result is as much to be\r\ncondemned as the waste of government funds in unnecessary expenditure.\r\nThe scope of a modern government in what it can and ought to accomplish\r\nfor its people has been widened far beyond the principles laid down by\r\nthe old \"laissez faire\" school of political writers, and this widening\r\nhas met popular approval.\r\n\r\nIn the Department of Agriculture the use of scientific experiments on a\r\nlarge scale and the spread of information derived from them for the\r\nimprovement of general agriculture must go on.\r\n\r\nThe importance of supervising business of great railways and industrial\r\ncombinations and the necessary investigation and prosecution of unlawful\r\nbusiness methods are another necessary tax upon Government which did not\r\nexist half a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe putting into force of laws which shall secure the conservation of\r\nour resources, so far as they may be within the jurisdiction of the\r\nFederal Government, including the most important work of saving and\r\nrestoring our forests and the great improvement of waterways, are all\r\nproper government functions which must involve large expenditure if\r\nproperly performed. While some of them, like the reclamation of arid\r\nlands, are made to pay for themselves, others are of such an indirect\r\nbenefit that this cannot be expected of them. A permanent improvement,\r\nlike the Panama Canal, should be treated as a distinct enterprise, and\r\nshould be paid for by the proceeds of bonds, the issue of which will\r\ndistribute its cost between the present and future generations in\r\naccordance with the benefits derived. It may well be submitted to the\r\nserious consideration of Congress whether the deepening and control of\r\nthe channel of a great river system, like that of the Ohio or of the\r\nMississippi, when definite and practical plans for the enterprise have\r\nbeen approved and determined upon, should not be provided for in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there are expenditures of Government absolutely necessary if\r\nour country is to maintain its proper place among the nations of the\r\nworld, and is to exercise its proper influence in defense of its own\r\ntrade interests in the maintenance of traditional American policy\r\nagainst the colonization of European monarchies in this hemisphere, and\r\nin the promotion of peace and international morality. I refer to the\r\ncost of maintaining a proper army, a proper navy, and suitable\r\nfortifications upon the mainland of the United States and in its\r\ndependencies.\r\n\r\nWe should have an army so organized and so officered as to be capable in\r\ntime of emergency, in cooperation with the national militia and under\r\nthe provisions of a proper national volunteer law, rapidly to expand\r\ninto a force sufficient to resist all probable invasion from abroad and\r\nto furnish a respectable expeditionary force if necessary in the\r\nmaintenance of our traditional American policy which bears the name of\r\nPresident Monroe.\r\n\r\nOur fortifications are yet in a state of only partial completeness, and\r\nthe number of men to man them is insufficient. In a few years however,\r\nthe usual annual appropriations for our coast defenses, both on the\r\nmainland and in the dependencies, will make them sufficient to resist\r\nall direct attack, and by that time we may hope that the men to man them\r\nwill be provided as a necessary adjunct. The distance of our shores from\r\nEurope and Asia of course reduces the necessity for maintaining under\r\narms a great army, but it does not take away the requirement of mere\r\nprudence--that we should have an army sufficiently large and so\r\nconstituted as to form a nucleus out of which a suitable force can\r\nquickly grow.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of the army may be affirmed in even a more emphatic\r\nway of the navy. A modern navy can not be improvised. It must be built\r\nand in existence when the emergency arises which calls for its use and\r\noperation. My distinguished predecessor has in many speeches and\r\nmessages set out with great force and striking language the necessity\r\nfor maintaining a strong navy commensurate with the coast line, the\r\ngovernmental resources, and the foreign trade of our Nation; and I wish\r\nto reiterate all the reasons which he has presented in favor of the\r\npolicy of maintaining a strong navy as the best conservator of our peace\r\nwith other nations, and the best means of securing respect for the\r\nassertion of our rights, the defense of our interests, and the exercise\r\nof our influence in international matters.\r\n\r\nOur international policy is always to promote peace. We shall enter into\r\nany war with a full consciousness of the awful consequences that it\r\nalways entails, whether successful or not, and we, of course, shall make\r\nevery effort consistent with national honor and the highest national\r\ninterest to avoid a resort to arms. We favor every instrumentality, like\r\nthat of the Hague Tribunal and arbitration treaties made with a view to\r\nits use in all international controversies, in order to maintain peace\r\nand to avoid war. But we should be blind to existing conditions and\r\nshould allow ourselves to become foolish idealists if we did not realize\r\nthat, with all the nations of the world armed and prepared for war, we\r\nmust be ourselves in a similar condition, in order to prevent other\r\nnations from taking advantage of us and of our inability to defend our\r\ninterests and assert our rights with a strong hand.\r\n\r\nIn the international controversies that are likely to arise in the\r\nOrient growing out of the question of the open door and other issues the\r\nUnited States can maintain her interests intact and can secure respect\r\nfor her just demands. She will not be able to do so, however, if it is\r\nunderstood that she never intends to back up her assertion of right and\r\nher defense of her interest by anything but mere verbal protest and\r\ndiplomatic note. For these reasons the expenses of the army and navy and\r\nof coast defenses should always be considered as something which the\r\nGovernment must pay for, and they should not be cut off through mere\r\nconsideration of economy. Our Government is able to afford a suitable\r\narmy and a suitable navy. It may maintain them without the slightest\r\ndanger to the Republic or the cause of free institutions, and fear of\r\nadditional taxation ought not to change a proper policy in this regard.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the United States in the Spanish war and since has given\r\nit a position of influence among the nations that it never had before,\r\nand should be constantly exerted to securing to its bona fide citizens,\r\nwhether native or naturalized, respect for them as such in foreign\r\ncountries. We should make every effort to prevent humiliating and\r\ndegrading prohibition against any of our citizens wishing temporarily to\r\nsojourn in foreign countries because of race or religion.\r\n\r\nThe admission of Asiatic immigrants who cannot be amalgamated with our\r\npopulation has been made the subject either of prohibitory clauses in\r\nour treaties and statutes or of strict administrative regulation secured\r\nby diplomatic negotiation. I sincerely hope that we may continue to\r\nminimize the evils likely to arise from such immigration without\r\nunnecessary friction and by mutual concessions between self-respecting\r\ngovernments. Meantime we must take every precaution to prevent, or\r\nfailing that, to punish outbursts of race feeling among our people\r\nagainst foreigners of whatever nationality who have by our grant a\r\ntreaty right to pursue lawful business here and to be protected against\r\nlawless assault or injury.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to point out a serious defect in the present federal\r\njurisdiction, which ought to be remedied at once. Having assured to\r\nother countries by treaty the protection of our laws for such of their\r\nsubjects or citizens as we permit to come within our jurisdiction, we\r\nnow leave to a state or a city, not under the control of the Federal\r\nGovernment, the duty of performing our international obligations in this\r\nrespect. By proper legislation we may, and ought to, place in the hands\r\nof the Federal Executive the means of enforcing the treaty rights of\r\nsuch aliens in the courts of the Federal Government. It puts our\r\nGovernment in a pusillanimous position to make definite engagements to\r\nprotect aliens and then to excuse the failure to perform those\r\nengagements by an explanation that the duty to keep them is in States or\r\ncities, not within our control. If we would promise we must put\r\nourselves in a position to perform our promise. We cannot permit the\r\npossible failure of justice, due to local prejudice in any State or\r\nmunicipal government, to expose us to the risk of a war which might be\r\navoided if federal jurisdiction was asserted by suitable legislation by\r\nCongress and carried out by proper proceedings instituted by the\r\nExecutive in the courts of the National Government.\r\n\r\nOne of the reforms to be carried out during the incoming administration\r\nis a change of our monetary and banking laws, so as to secure greater\r\nelasticity in the forms of currency available for trade and to prevent\r\nthe limitations of law from operating to increase the embarrassment of a\r\nfinancial panic. The monetary commission, lately appointed, is giving\r\nfull consideration to existing conditions and to all proposed remedies,\r\nand will doubtless suggest one that will meet the requirements of\r\nbusiness and of public interest.\r\n\r\nWe may hope that the report will embody neither the narrow dew of those\r\nwho believe that the sole purpose of the new system should be to secure\r\na large return on banking capital or of those who would have greater\r\nexpansion of currency with little regard to provisions for its immediate\r\nredemption or ultimate security. There is no subject of economic\r\ndiscussion so intricate and so likely to evoke differing views and\r\ndogmatic statements as this one. The commission, in studying the general\r\ninfluence of currency on business and of business on currency, have\r\nwisely extended their investigations in European banking and monetary\r\nmethods. The information that they have derived from such experts as\r\nthey have found abroad will undoubtedly be found helpful in the solution\r\nof the difficult problem they have in hand.\r\n\r\nThe incoming Congress should promptly fulfill the promise of the\r\nRepublican platform and pass a proper postal savings bank bill. It will\r\nnot be unwise or excessive paternalism. The promise to repay by the\r\nGovernment will furnish an inducement to savings deposits which private\r\nenterprise can not supply and at such a low rate of interest as not to\r\nwithdraw custom from existing banks. It will substantially increase the\r\nfunds available for investment as capital in useful enterprises. It will\r\nfurnish absolute security which makes the proposed scheme of government\r\nguaranty of deposits so alluring, without its pernicious results.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that the incoming Congress will be alive, as it should\r\nbe, to the importance of our foreign trade and of encouraging it in\r\nevery way feasible. The possibility of increasing this trade in the\r\nOrient, in the Philippines, and in South America are known to everyone\r\nwho has given the matter attention. The direct effect of free trade\r\nbetween this country and the Philippines will be marked upon our sales\r\nof cottons, agricultural machinery, and other manufactures. The\r\nnecessity of the establishment of direct lines of steamers between North\r\nand South America has been brought to the attention of Congress by my\r\npredecessor and by Mr. Root before and after his noteworthy visit to\r\nthat continent, and I sincerely hope that Congress may be induced to see\r\nthe wisdom of a tentative effort to establish such lines by the use of\r\nmail subsidies.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the part which the Departments of Agriculture and of\r\nCommerce and Labor may play in ridding the markets of Europe of\r\nprohibitions and discriminations against the importation of our products\r\nis fully understood, and it is hoped that the use of the maximum and\r\nminimum feature of our tariff law to be soon passed will be effective to\r\nremove many of those restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe Panama Canal will have a most important bearing upon the trade\r\nbetween the eastern and far western sections of our country, and will\r\ngreatly increase the facilities for transportation between the eastern\r\nand the western seaboard, and may possibly revolutionize the\r\ntranscontinental rates with respect to bulky merchandise. It will also\r\nhave a most beneficial effect to increase the trade between the eastern\r\nseaboard of the United States and the western coast of South America,\r\nand, indeed, with some of the important ports on the east coast of South\r\nAmerica reached by rail from the west coast.\r\n\r\nThe work on the canal is making most satisfactory progress. The type of\r\nthe canal as a lock canal was fixed by Congress after a full\r\nconsideration of the conflicting reports of the majority and minority of\r\nthe consulting board, and after the recommendation of the War Department\r\nand the Executive upon those reports. Recent suggestion that something\r\nhad occurred on the Isthmus to make the lock type of the canal less\r\nfeasible than it was supposed to be when the reports were made and the\r\npolicy determined on led to a visit to the Isthmus of a board of\r\ncompetent engineers to examine the Gatun dam and locks, which are the\r\nkey of the lock type. The report of that board shows nothing has\r\noccurred in the nature of newly revealed evidence which should change\r\nthe views once formed in the original discussion. The construction will\r\ngo on under a most effective organization controlled by Colonel Goethals\r\nand his fellow army engineers associated with him, and will certainly be\r\ncompleted early in the next administration, if not before.\r\n\r\nSome type of canal must be constructed. The lock type has been selected.\r\nWe are all in favor of having it built as promptly as possible. We must\r\nnot now, therefore, keep up a fire in the rear of the agents whom we\r\nhave authorized to do our work on the Isthmus. We must hold up their\r\nhands, and speaking for the incoming administration I wish to say that I\r\npropose to devote all the energy possible and under my control to\r\npushing of this work on the plans which have been adopted, and to stand\r\nbehind the men who are doing faithful, hard work to bring about the\r\nearly completion of this, the greatest constructive enterprise of modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe governments of our dependencies in Porto Rico and the Philippines\r\nare progressing as favorably as could be desired. The prosperity of\r\nPorto Rico continues unabated. The business conditions in the\r\nPhilippines are not all that we could wish them to be, but with the\r\npassage of the new tariff bill permitting free trade between the United\r\nStates and the archipelago, with such limitations on sugar and tobacco\r\nas shall prevent injury to domestic interests in those products, we can\r\ncount on an improvement in business conditions in the Philippines and\r\nthe development of a mutually profitable trade between this country and\r\nthe islands. Meantime our Government in each dependency is upholding the\r\ntraditions of civil liberty and increasing popular control which might\r\nbe expected under American auspices. The work which we are doing there\r\nredounds to our credit as a nation.\r\n\r\nI look forward with hope to increasing the already good feeling between\r\nthe South and the other sections of the country. My chief purpose is not\r\nto effect a change in the electoral vote of the Southern States. That is\r\na secondary consideration. What I look forward to is an increase in the\r\ntolerance of political views of all kinds and their advocacy throughout\r\nthe South, and the existence of a respectable political opposition in\r\nevery State; even more than this, to an increased feeling on the part of\r\nall the people in the South that this Government is their Government,\r\nand that its officers in their states are their officers.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of this question can not, however, be complete and\r\nfull without reference to the negro race, its progress and its present\r\ncondition. The thirteenth amendment secured them freedom; the fourteenth\r\namendment due process of law, protection of property, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness; and the fifteenth amendment attempted to secure the negro\r\nagainst any deprivation of the privilege to vote because he was a negro.\r\nThe thirteenth and fourteenth amendments have been generally enforced\r\nand have secured the objects for which they are intended. While the\r\nfifteenth amendment has not been generally observed in the past, it\r\nought to be observed, and the tendency of Southern legislation today is\r\ntoward the enactment of electoral qualifications which shall square with\r\nthat amendment. Of course, the mere adoption of a constitutional law is\r\nonly one step in the right direction. It must be fairly and justly\r\nenforced as well. In time both will come. Hence it is clear to all that\r\nthe domination of an ignorant, irresponsible element can be prevented by\r\nconstitutional laws which shall exclude from voting both negroes and\r\nwhites not having education or other qualifications thought to be\r\nnecessary for a proper electorate. The danger of the control of an\r\nignorant electorate has therefore passed. With this change, the interest\r\nwhich many of the Southern white citizens take in the welfare of the\r\nnegroes has increased. The colored men must base their hope on the\r\nresults of their own industry, self-restraint, thrift, and business\r\nsuccess, as well as upon the aid and comfort and sympathy which they may\r\nreceive from their white neighbors of the South.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when Northerners who sympathized with the negro in his\r\nnecessary struggle for better conditions sought to give him the suffrage\r\nas a protection to enforce its exercise against the prevailing sentiment\r\nof the South. The movement proved to be a failure. What remains is the\r\nfifteenth amendment to the Constitution and the right to have statutes\r\nof States specifying qualifications for electors subjected to the test\r\nof compliance with that amendment. This is a great protection to the\r\nnegro. It never will be repealed, and it never ought to be repealed. If\r\nit had not passed, it might be difficult now to adopt it; but with it in\r\nour fundamental law, the policy of Southern legislation must and will\r\ntend to obey it, and so long as the statutes of the States meet the test\r\nof this amendment and are not otherwise in conflict with the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States, it is not the disposition or\r\nwithin the province of the Federal Government to interfere with the\r\nregulation by Southern States of their domestic affairs. There is in the\r\nSouth a stronger feeling than ever among the intelligent well-to-do, and\r\ninfluential element in favor of the industrial education of the negro\r\nand the encouragement of the race to make themselves useful members of\r\nthe community. The progress which the negro has made in the last fifty\r\nyears, from slavery, when its statistics are reviewed, is marvelous, and\r\nit furnishes every reason to hope that in the next twenty-five years a\r\nstill greater improvement in his condition as a productive member of\r\nsociety, on the farm, and in the shop, and in other occupations may\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThe negroes are now Americans. Their ancestors came here years ago\r\nagainst their will, and this is their only country and their only flag.\r\nThey have shown themselves anxious to live for it and to die for it.\r\nEncountering the race feeling against them, subjected at times to cruel\r\ninjustice growing out of it, they may well have our profound sympathy\r\nand aid in the struggle they are making. We are charged with the sacred\r\nduty of making their path as smooth and easy as we can. Any recognition\r\nof their distinguished men, any appointment to office from among their\r\nnumber, is properly taken as an encouragement and an appreciation of\r\ntheir progress, and this just policy should be pursued when suitable\r\noccasion offers.\r\n\r\nBut it may well admit of doubt whether, in the case of any race, an\r\nappointment of one of their number to a local office in a community in\r\nwhich the race feeling is so widespread and acute as to interfere with\r\nthe ease and facility with which the local government business can be\r\ndone by the appointee is of sufficient benefit by way of encouragement\r\nto the race to outweigh the recurrence and increase of race feeling\r\nwhich such an appointment is likely to engender. Therefore the\r\nExecutive, in recognizing the negro race by appointments, must exercise\r\na careful discretion not thereby to do it more harm than good. On the\r\nother hand, we must be careful not to encourage the mere pretense of\r\nrace feeling manufactured in the interest of individual political\r\nambition.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have not the slightest race prejudice or feeling, and\r\nrecognition of its existence only awakens in my heart a deeper sympathy\r\nfor those who have to bear it or suffer from it, and I question the\r\nwisdom of a policy which is likely to increase it. Meantime, if nothing\r\nis done to prevent it, a better feeling between the negroes and the\r\nwhites in the South will continue to grow, and more and more of the\r\nwhite people will come to realize that the future of the South is to be\r\nmuch benefited by the industrial and intellectual progress of the negro.\r\nThe exercise of political franchises by those of this race who are\r\nintelligent and well to do will be acquiesced in, and the right to vote\r\nwill be withheld only from the ignorant and irresponsible of both races.\r\n\r\nThere is one other matter to which I shall refer. It was made the\r\nsubject of great controversy during the election and calls for at least\r\na passing reference now. My distinguished predecessor has given much\r\nattention to the cause of labor, with whose struggle for better things\r\nhe has shown the sincerest sympathy. At his instance Congress has passed\r\nthe bill fixing the liability of interstate carriers to their employees\r\nfor injury sustained in the course of employment, abolishing the rule of\r\nfellow-servant and the common-law rule as to contributory negligence,\r\nand substituting therefor the so-called rule of \"comparative\r\nnegligence.\" It has also passed a law fixing the compensation of\r\ngovernment employees for injuries sustained in the employ of the\r\nGovernment through the negligence of the superior. It has also passed a\r\nmodel child-labor law for the District of Columbia. In previous\r\nadministrations an arbitration law for interstate commerce railroads and\r\ntheir employees, and laws for the application of safety devices to save\r\nthe lives and limbs of employees of interstate railroads had been\r\npassed. Additional legislation of this kind was passed by the outgoing\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nI wish to say that insofar as I can I hope to promote the enactment of\r\nfurther legislation of this character. I am strongly convinced that the\r\nGovernment should make itself as responsible to employees injured in its\r\nemploy as an interstate-railway corporation is made responsible by\r\nfederal law to its employees; and I shall be glad, whenever any\r\nadditional reasonable safety device can be invented to reduce the loss\r\nof life and limb among railway employees, to urge Congress to require\r\nits adoption by interstate railways.\r\n\r\nAnother labor question has arisen which has awakened the most excited\r\ndiscussion. That is in respect to the power of the federal courts to\r\nissue injunctions in industrial disputes. As to that, my convictions are\r\nfixed. Take away from the courts, if it could be taken away, the power\r\nto issue injunctions in labor disputes, and it would create a privileged\r\nclass among the laborers and save the lawless among their number from a\r\nmost needful remedy available to all men for the protection of their\r\nbusiness against lawless invasion. The proposition that business is not\r\na property or pecuniary right which can be protected by equitable\r\ninjunction is utterly without foundation in precedent or reason. The\r\nproposition is usually linked with one to make the secondary boycott\r\nlawful. Such a proposition is at variance with the American instinct,\r\nand will find no support, in my judgment, when submitted to the American\r\npeople. The secondary boycott is an instrument of tyranny, and ought not\r\nto be made legitimate.\r\n\r\nThe issue of a temporary restraining order without notice has in several\r\ninstances been abused by its inconsiderate exercise, and to remedy this\r\nthe platform upon which I was elected recommends the formulation in a\r\nstatute of the conditions under which such a temporary restraining order\r\nought to issue. A statute can and ought to be framed to embody the best\r\nmodern practice, and can bring the subject so closely to the attention\r\nof the court as to make abuses of the process unlikely in the future.\r\nThe American people, if I understand them, insist that the authority of\r\nthe courts shall be sustained, and are opposed to any change in the\r\nprocedure by which the powers of a court may be weakened and the\r\nfearless and effective administration of justice be interfered with.\r\n\r\nHaving thus reviewed the questions likely to recur during my\r\nadministration, and having expressed in a summary way the position which\r\nI expect to take in recommendations to Congress and in my conduct as an\r\nExecutive, I invoke the considerate sympathy and support of my\r\nfellow-citizens and the aid of the Almighty God in the discharge of my\r\nresponsible duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODROW WILSON, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, MARCH 4, 1913\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The election of 1912 produced a Democratic victory\r\nover the split vote for President Taft's Republican ticket and Theodore\r\nRoosevelt's Progressive Party. The Governor of New Jersey and former\r\nPrinceton University president was accompanied by President Taft to the\r\nCapitol. The oath of office was administered on the East Portico by\r\nChief Justice Edward White.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been a change of government. It began two years ago, when the\r\nHouse of Representatives became Democratic by a decisive majority. It\r\nhas now been completed. The Senate about to assemble will also be\r\nDemocratic. The offices of President and Vice-President have been put\r\ninto the hands of Democrats. What does the change mean? That is the\r\nquestion that is uppermost in our minds to-day. That is the question I\r\nam going to try to answer, in order, if I may, to interpret the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIt means much more than the mere success of a party. The success of a\r\nparty means little except when the Nation is using that party for a\r\nlarge and definite purpose. No one can mistake the purpose for which the\r\nNation now seeks to use the Democratic Party. It seeks to use it to\r\ninterpret a change in its own plans and point of view. Some old things\r\nwith which we had grown familiar, and which had begun to creep into the\r\nvery habit of our thought and of our lives, have altered their aspect as\r\nwe have latterly looked critically upon them, with fresh, awakened eyes;\r\nhave dropped their disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister.\r\nSome new things, as we look frankly upon them, willing to comprehend\r\ntheir real character, have come to assume the aspect of things long\r\nbelieved in and familiar, stuff of our own convictions. We have been\r\nrefreshed by a new insight into our own life.\r\n\r\nWe see that in many things that life is very great. It is incomparably\r\ngreat in its material aspects, in its body of wealth, in the diversity\r\nand sweep of its energy, in the industries which have been conceived and\r\nbuilt up by the genius of individual men and the limitless enterprise of\r\ngroups of men. It is great, also, very great, in its moral force.\r\nNowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more\r\nstriking forms the beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and\r\ncounsel in their efforts to rectify wrong, alleviate suffering, and set\r\nthe weak in the way of strength and hope. We have built up, moreover, a\r\ngreat system of government, which has stood through a long age as in\r\nmany respects a model for those who seek to set liberty upon foundations\r\nthat will endure against fortuitous change, against storm and accident.\r\nOur life contains every great thing, and contains it in rich abundance.\r\n\r\nBut the evil has come with the good, and much fine gold has been\r\ncorroded. With riches has come inexcusable waste. We have squandered a\r\ngreat part of what we might have used, and have not stopped to conserve\r\nthe exceeding bounty of nature, without which our genius for enterprise\r\nwould have been worthless and impotent, scorning to be careful,\r\nshamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient. We have been proud\r\nof our industrial achievements, but we have not hitherto stopped\r\nthoughtfully enough to count the human cost, the cost of lives snuffed\r\nout, of energies overtaxed and broken, the fearful physical and\r\nspiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead\r\nweight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly the years through. The\r\ngroans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears, the solemn,\r\nmoving undertone of our life, coming up out of the mines and factories,\r\nand out of every home where the struggle had its intimate and familiar\r\nseat. With the great Government went many deep secret things which we\r\ntoo long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid, fearless eyes.\r\nThe great Government we loved has too often been made use of for private\r\nand selfish purposes, and those who used it had forgotten the people.\r\n\r\nAt last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see\r\nthe bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and\r\nvital. With this vision we approach new affairs. Our duty is to cleanse,\r\nto reconsider, to restore, to correct the evil without impairing the\r\ngood, to purify and humanize every process of our common life without\r\nweakening or sentimentalizing it. There has been something crude and\r\nheartless and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great. Our\r\nthought has been \"Let every man look out for himself, let every\r\ngeneration look out for itself,\" while we reared giant machinery which\r\nmade it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control\r\nshould have a chance to look out for themselves. We had not forgotten\r\nour morals. We remembered well enough that we had set up a policy which\r\nwas meant to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful, with an\r\neye single to the standards of justice and fair play, and remembered it\r\nwith pride. But we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great.\r\n\r\nWe have come now to the sober second thought. The scales of heedlessness\r\nhave fallen from our eyes. We have made up our minds to square every\r\nprocess of our national life again with the standards we so proudly set\r\nup at the beginning and have always carried at our hearts. Our work is a\r\nwork of restoration.\r\n\r\nWe have itemized with some degree of particularity the things that ought\r\nto be altered and here are some of the chief items: A tariff which cuts\r\nus off from our proper part in the commerce of the world, violates the\r\njust principles of taxation, and makes the Government a facile\r\ninstrument in the hand of private interests; a banking and currency\r\nsystem based upon the necessity of the Government to sell its bonds\r\nfifty years ago and perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and\r\nrestricting credits; an industrial system which, take it on all its\r\nsides, financial as well as administrative, holds capital in leading\r\nstrings, restricts the liberties and limits the opportunities of labor,\r\nand exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resources of the\r\ncountry; a body of agricultural activities never yet given the\r\nefficiency of great business undertakings or served as it should be\r\nthrough the instrumentality of science taken directly to the farm, or\r\nafforded the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs;\r\nwatercourses undeveloped, waste places unreclaimed, forests untended,\r\nfast disappearing without plan or prospect of renewal, unregarded waste\r\nheaps at every mine. We have studied as perhaps no other nation has the\r\nmost effective means of production, but we have not studied cost or\r\neconomy as we should either as organizers of industry, as statesmen, or\r\nas individuals.\r\n\r\nNor have we studied and perfected the means by which government may be\r\nput at the service of humanity, in safeguarding the health of the\r\nNation, the health of its men and its women and its children, as well as\r\ntheir rights in the struggle for existence. This is no sentimental duty.\r\nThe firm basis of government is justice, not pity. These are matters of\r\njustice. There can be no equality or opportunity, the first essential of\r\njustice in the body politic, if men and women and children be not\r\nshielded in their lives, their very vitality, from the consequences of\r\ngreat industrial and social processes which they can not alter, control,\r\nor singly cope with. Society must see to it that it does not itself\r\ncrush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts. The first duty of\r\nlaw is to keep sound the society it serves. Sanitary laws, pure food\r\nlaws, and laws determining conditions of labor which individuals are\r\npowerless to determine for themselves are intimate parts of the very\r\nbusiness of justice and legal efficiency.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the things we ought to do, and not leave the others\r\nundone, the old-fashioned, never-to-be-neglected, fundamental\r\nsafeguarding of property and of individual right. This is the high\r\nenterprise of the new day: To lift everything that concerns our life as\r\na Nation to the light that shines from the hearthfire of every man's\r\nconscience and vision of the right. It is inconceivable that we should\r\ndo this as partisans; it is inconceivable we should do it in ignorance\r\nof the facts as they are or in blind haste. We shall restore, not\r\ndestroy. We shall deal with our economic system as it is and as it may\r\nbe modified, not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to\r\nwrite upon; and step by step we shall make it what it should be, in the\r\nspirit of those who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and\r\nknowledge, not shallow self-satisfaction or the excitement of excursions\r\nwhither they can not tell. Justice, and only justice, shall always be\r\nour motto.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it will be no cool process of mere science. The Nation has been\r\ndeeply stirred, stirred by a solemn passion, stirred by the knowledge of\r\nwrong, of ideals lost, of government too often debauched and made an\r\ninstrument of evil. The feelings with which we face this new age of\r\nright and opportunity sweep across our heartstrings like some air out of\r\nGod's own presence, where justice and mercy are reconciled and the judge\r\nand the brother are one. We know our task to be no mere task of politics\r\nbut a task which shall search us through and through, whether we be able\r\nto understand our time and the need of our people, whether we be indeed\r\ntheir spokesmen and interpreters, whether we have the pure heart to\r\ncomprehend and the rectified will to choose our high course of action.\r\n\r\nThis is not a day of triumph; it is a day of dedication. Here muster,\r\nnot the forces of party, but the forces of humanity. Men's hearts wait\r\nupon us; men's lives hang in the balance; men's hopes call upon us to\r\nsay what we will do. Who shall live up to the great trust? Who dares\r\nfail to try? I summon all honest men, all patriotic, all forward-looking\r\nmen, to my side. God helping me, I will not fail them, if they will but\r\ncounsel and sustain me!\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODROW WILSON, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MARCH 5, 1917\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  March 4 was a Sunday, but the President took the\r\noath of office at the Capitol in the President's Room that morning. The\r\noath was taken again the next day, administered by Chief Justice Edward\r\nWhite on the East Portico of the Capitol. The specter of war with\r\nGermany hung over the events surrounding the inauguration. A Senate\r\nfilibuster on arming American merchant vessels against submarine attacks\r\nhad closed the last hours of the Sixty-fourth Congress without passage.\r\nDespite the campaign slogan \"He kept us out of war,\" the President asked\r\nCongress on April 2 to declare war. It was declared on April 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Fellow Citizens:\r\n\r\nThe four years which have elapsed since last I stood in this place have\r\nbeen crowded with counsel and action of the most vital interest and\r\nconsequence. Perhaps no equal period in our history has been so fruitful\r\nof important reforms in our economic and industrial life or so full of\r\nsignificant changes in the spirit and purpose of our political action.\r\nWe have sought very thoughtfully to set our house in order, correct the\r\ngrosser errors and abuses of our industrial life, liberate and quicken\r\nthe processes of our national genius and energy, and lift our politics\r\nto a broader view of the people's essential interests.\r\n\r\nIt is a record of singular variety and singular distinction. But I shall\r\nnot attempt to review it. It speaks for itself and will be of increasing\r\ninfluence as the years go by. This is not the time for retrospect. It is\r\ntime rather to speak our thoughts and purposes concerning the present\r\nand the immediate future.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have centered counsel and action with such unusual\r\nconcentration and success upon the great problems of domestic\r\nlegislation to which we addressed ourselves four years ago, other\r\nmatters have more and more forced themselves upon our attention--matters\r\nlying outside our own life as a nation and over which we had no control,\r\nbut which, despite our wish to keep free of them, have drawn us more and\r\nmore irresistibly into their own current and influence.\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible to avoid them. They have affected the life of the\r\nwhole world. They have shaken men everywhere with a passion and an\r\napprehension they never knew before. It has been hard to preserve calm\r\ncounsel while the thought of our own people swayed this way and that\r\nunder their influence. We are a composite and cosmopolitan people. We\r\nare of the blood of all the nations that are at war. The currents of our\r\nthoughts as well as the currents of our trade run quick at all seasons\r\nback and forth between us and them. The war inevitably set its mark from\r\nthe first alike upon our minds, our industries, our commerce, our\r\npolitics and our social action. To be indifferent to it, or independent\r\nof it, was out of the question.\r\n\r\nAnd yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part of\r\nit. In that consciousness, despite many divisions, we have drawn closer\r\ntogether. We have been deeply wronged upon the seas, but we have not\r\nwished to wrong or injure in return; have retained throughout the\r\nconsciousness of standing in some sort apart, intent upon an interest\r\nthat transcended the immediate issues of the war itself.\r\n\r\nAs some of the injuries done us have become intolerable we have still\r\nbeen clear that we wished nothing for ourselves that we were not ready\r\nto demand for all mankind--fair dealing, justice, the freedom to live\r\nand to be at ease against organized wrong.\r\n\r\nIt is in this spirit and with this thought that we have grown more and\r\nmore aware, more and more certain that the part we wished to play was\r\nthe part of those who mean to vindicate and fortify peace. We have been\r\nobliged to arm ourselves to make good our claim to a certain minimum of\r\nright and of freedom of action. We stand firm in armed neutrality since\r\nit seems that in no other way we can demonstrate what it is we insist\r\nupon and cannot forget. We may even be drawn on, by circumstances, not\r\nby our own purpose or desire, to a more active assertion of our rights\r\nas we see them and a more immediate association with the great struggle\r\nitself. But nothing will alter our thought or our purpose. They are too\r\nclear to be obscured. They are too deeply rooted in the principles of\r\nour national life to be altered. We desire neither conquest nor\r\nadvantage. We wish nothing that can be had only at the cost of another\r\npeople. We always professed unselfish purpose and we covet the\r\nopportunity to prove our professions are sincere.\r\n\r\nThere are many things still to be done at home, to clarify our own\r\npolitics and add new vitality to the industrial processes of our own\r\nlife, and we shall do them as time and opportunity serve, but we realize\r\nthat the greatest things that remain to be done must be done with the\r\nwhole world for stage and in cooperation with the wide and universal\r\nforces of mankind, and we are making our spirits ready for those things.\r\n\r\nWe are provincials no longer. The tragic events of the thirty months of\r\nvital turmoil through which we have just passed have made us citizens of\r\nthe world. There can be no turning back. Our own fortunes as a nation\r\nare involved whether we would have it so or not.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we are not the less Americans on that account. We shall be the\r\nmore American if we but remain true to the principles in which we have\r\nbeen bred. They are not the principles of a province or of a single\r\ncontinent. We have known and boasted all along that they were the\r\nprinciples of a liberated mankind. These, therefore, are the things we\r\nshall stand for, whether in war or in peace:\r\n\r\nThat all nations are equally interested in the peace of the world and in\r\nthe political stability of free peoples, and equally responsible for\r\ntheir maintenance; that the essential principle of peace is the actual\r\nequality of nations in all matters of right or privilege; that peace\r\ncannot securely or justly rest upon an armed balance of power; that\r\ngovernments derive all their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned and that no other powers should be supported by the common\r\nthought, purpose or power of the family of nations; that the seas should\r\nbe equally free and safe for the use of all peoples, under rules set up\r\nby common agreement and consent, and that, so far as practicable, they\r\nshould be accessible to all upon equal terms; that national armaments\r\nshall be limited to the necessities of national order and domestic\r\nsafety; that the community of interest and of power upon which peace\r\nmust henceforth depend imposes upon each nation the duty of seeing to it\r\nthat all influences proceeding from its own citizens meant to encourage\r\nor assist revolution in other states should be sternly and effectually\r\nsuppressed and prevented.\r\n\r\nI need not argue these principles to you, my fellow countrymen; they are\r\nyour own part and parcel of your own thinking and your own motives in\r\naffairs. They spring up native amongst us. Upon this as a platform of\r\npurpose and of action we can stand together. And it is imperative that\r\nwe should stand together. We are being forged into a new unity amidst\r\nthe fires that now blaze throughout the world. In their ardent heat we\r\nshall, in God's Providence, let us hope, be purged of faction and\r\ndivision, purified of the errant humors of party and of private\r\ninterest, and shall stand forth in the days to come with a new dignity\r\nof national pride and spirit. Let each man see to it that the dedication\r\nis in his own heart, the high purpose of the nation in his own mind,\r\nruler of his own will and desire.\r\n\r\nI stand here and have taken the high and solemn oath to which you have\r\nbeen audience because the people of the United States have chosen me for\r\nthis august delegation of power and have by their gracious judgment\r\nnamed me their leader in affairs.\r\n\r\nI know now what the task means. I realize to the full the responsibility\r\nwhich it involves. I pray God I may be given the wisdom and the prudence\r\nto do my duty in the true spirit of this great people. I am their\r\nservant and can succeed only as they sustain and guide me by their\r\nconfidence and their counsel. The thing I shall count upon, the thing\r\nwithout which neither counsel nor action will avail, is the unity of\r\nAmerica--an America united in feeling, in purpose and in its vision of\r\nduty, of opportunity and of service.\r\n\r\nWe are to beware of all men who would turn the tasks and the necessities\r\nof the nation to their own private profit or use them for the building\r\nup of private power.\r\n\r\nUnited alike in the conception of our duty and in the high resolve to\r\nperform it in the face of all men, let us dedicate ourselves to the\r\ngreat task to which we must now set our hand. For myself I beg your\r\ntolerance, your countenance and your united aid.\r\n\r\nThe shadows that now lie dark upon our path will soon be dispelled, and\r\nwe shall walk with the light all about us if we be but true to\r\nourselves--to ourselves as we have wished to be known in the counsels of\r\nthe world and in the thought of all those who love liberty and justice\r\nand the right exalted.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARREN G.

A former newspaper publisher and\r\nGovernor of Ohio, the President-elect rode to the Capitol with President\r\nWilson in the first automobile to be used in an inauguration. President\r\nWilson had suffered a stroke in 1919, and his fragile health prevented\r\nhis attendance at the ceremony on the East Portico of the Capitol. The\r\noath of office was administered by Chief Justice Edward White, using the\r\nBible from George Washington's first inauguration. The address to the\r\ncrowd at the Capitol was broadcast on a loudspeaker. A simple parade\r\nfollowed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Countrymen:\r\n\r\nWhen one surveys the world about him after the great storm, noting the\r\nmarks of destruction and yet rejoicing in the ruggedness of the things\r\nwhich withstood it, if he is an American he breathes the clarified\r\natmosphere with a strange mingling of regret and new hope. We have seen\r\na world passion spend its fury, but we contemplate our Republic\r\nunshaken, and hold our civilization secure. Liberty--liberty within the\r\nlaw--and civilization are inseparable, and though both were threatened\r\nwe find them now secure; and there comes to Americans the profound\r\nassurance that our representative government is the highest expression\r\nand surest guaranty of both.\r\n\r\nStanding in this presence, mindful of the solemnity of this occasion,\r\nfeeling the emotions which no one may know until he senses the great\r\nweight of responsibility for himself, I must utter my belief in the\r\ndivine inspiration of the founding fathers. Surely there must have been\r\nGod's intent in the making of this new-world Republic. Ours is an\r\norganic law which had but one ambiguity, and we saw that effaced in a\r\nbaptism of sacrifice and blood, with union maintained, the Nation\r\nsupreme, and its concord inspiring. We have seen the world rivet its\r\nhopeful gaze on the great truths on which the founders wrought. We have\r\nseen civil, human, and religious liberty verified and glorified. In the\r\nbeginning the Old World scoffed at our experiment; today our foundations\r\nof political and social belief stand unshaken, a precious inheritance to\r\nourselves, an inspiring example of freedom and civilization to all\r\nmankind. Let us express renewed and strengthened devotion, in grateful\r\nreverence for the immortal beginning, and utter our confidence in the\r\nsupreme fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThe recorded progress of our Republic, materially and spiritually, in\r\nitself proves the wisdom of the inherited policy of noninvolvement in\r\nOld World affairs. Confident of our ability to work out our own destiny,\r\nand jealously guarding our right to do so, we seek no part in directing\r\nthe destinies of the Old World. We do not mean to be entangled. We will\r\naccept no responsibility except as our own conscience and judgment, in\r\neach instance, may determine.\r\n\r\nOur eyes never will be blind to a developing menace, our ears never deaf\r\nto the call of civilization. We recognize the new order in the world,\r\nwith the closer contacts which progress has wrought. We sense the call\r\nof the human heart for fellowship, fraternity, and cooperation. We crave\r\nfriendship and harbor no hate. But America, our America, the America\r\nbuilded on the foundation laid by the inspired fathers, can be a party\r\nto no permanent military alliance. It can enter into no political\r\ncommitments, nor assume any economic obligations which will subject our\r\ndecisions to any other than our own authority.\r\n\r\nI am sure our own people will not misunderstand, nor will the world\r\nmisconstrue. We have no thought to impede the paths to closer\r\nrelationship. We wish to promote understanding. We want to do our part\r\nin making offensive warfare so hateful that Governments and peoples who\r\nresort to it must prove the righteousness of their cause or stand as\r\noutlaws before the bar of civilization.\r\n\r\nWe are ready to associate ourselves with the nations of the world, great\r\nand small, for conference, for counsel; to seek the expressed views of\r\nworld opinion; to recommend a way to approximate disarmament and relieve\r\nthe crushing burdens of military and naval establishments. We elect to\r\nparticipate in suggesting plans for mediation, conciliation, and\r\narbitration, and would gladly join in that expressed conscience of\r\nprogress, which seeks to clarify and write the laws of international\r\nrelationship, and establish a world court for the disposition of such\r\njusticiable questions as nations are agreed to submit thereto. In\r\nexpressing aspirations, in seeking practical plans, in translating\r\nhumanity's new concept of righteousness and justice and its hatred of\r\nwar into recommended action we are ready most heartily to unite, but\r\nevery commitment must be made in the exercise of our national\r\nsovereignty. Since freedom impelled, and independence inspired, and\r\nnationality exalted, a world supergovernment is contrary to everything\r\nwe cherish and can have no sanction by our Republic. This is not\r\nselfishness, it is sanctity. It is not aloofness, it is security. It is\r\nnot suspicion of others, it is patriotic adherence to the things which\r\nmade us what we are.\r\n\r\nToday, better than ever before, we know the aspirations of humankind,\r\nand share them. We have come to a new realization of our place in the\r\nworld and a new appraisal of our Nation by the world. The unselfishness\r\nof these United States is a thing proven; our devotion to peace for\r\nourselves and for the world is well established; our concern for\r\npreserved civilization has had its impassioned and heroic expression.\r\nThere was no American failure to resist the attempted reversion of\r\ncivilization; there will be no failure today or tomorrow.\r\n\r\nThe success of our popular government rests wholly upon the correct\r\ninterpretation of the deliberate, intelligent, dependable popular will\r\nof America. In a deliberate questioning of a suggested change of\r\nnational policy, where internationality was to supersede nationality, we\r\nturned to a referendum, to the American people. There was ample\r\ndiscussion, and there is a public mandate in manifest understanding.\r\n\r\nAmerica is ready to encourage, eager to initiate, anxious to participate\r\nin any seemly program likely to lessen the probability of war, and\r\npromote that brotherhood of mankind which must be God's highest\r\nconception of human relationship. Because we cherish ideals of justice\r\nand peace, because we appraise international comity and helpful\r\nrelationship no less highly than any people of the world, we aspire to a\r\nhigh place in the moral leadership of civilization, and we hold a\r\nmaintained America, the proven Republic, the unshaken temple of\r\nrepresentative democracy, to be not only an inspiration and example, but\r\nthe highest agency of strengthening good will and promoting accord on\r\nboth continents.\r\n\r\nMankind needs a world-wide benediction of understanding. It is needed\r\namong individuals, among peoples, among governments, and it will\r\ninaugurate an era of good feeling to make the birth of a new order. In\r\nsuch understanding men will strive confidently for the promotion of\r\ntheir better relationships and nations will promote the comities so\r\nessential to peace.\r\n\r\nWe must understand that ties of trade bind nations in closest intimacy,\r\nand none may receive except as he gives. We have not strengthened ours\r\nin accordance with our resources or our genius, notably on our own\r\ncontinent, where a galaxy of Republics reflects the glory of new-world\r\ndemocracy, but in the new order of finance and trade we mean to promote\r\nenlarged activities and seek expanded confidence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can make no more helpful contribution by example than prove a\r\nRepublic's capacity to emerge from the wreckage of war. While the\r\nworld's embittered travail did not leave us devastated lands nor\r\ndesolated cities, left no gaping wounds, no breast with hate, it did\r\ninvolve us in the delirium of expenditure, in expanded currency and\r\ncredits, in unbalanced industry, in unspeakable waste, and disturbed\r\nrelationships. While it uncovered our portion of hateful selfishness at\r\nhome, it also revealed the heart of America as sound and fearless, and\r\nbeating in confidence unfailing.\r\n\r\nAmid it all we have riveted the gaze of all civilization to the\r\nunselfishness and the righteousness of representative democracy, where\r\nour freedom never has made offensive warfare, never has sought\r\nterritorial aggrandizement through force, never has turned to the\r\narbitrament of arms until reason has been exhausted. When the\r\nGovernments of the earth shall have established a freedom like our own\r\nand shall have sanctioned the pursuit of peace as we have practiced it,\r\nI believe the last sorrow and the final sacrifice of international\r\nwarfare will have been written.\r\n\r\nLet me speak to the maimed and wounded soldiers who are present today,\r\nand through them convey to their comrades the gratitude of the Republic\r\nfor their sacrifices in its defense. A generous country will never\r\nforget the services you rendered, and you may hope for a policy under\r\nGovernment that will relieve any maimed successors from taking your\r\nplaces on another such occasion as this.\r\n\r\nOur supreme task is the resumption of our onward, normal way.\r\nReconstruction, readjustment, restoration all these must follow. I would\r\nlike to hasten them. If it will lighten the spirit and add to the\r\nresolution with which we take up the task, let me repeat for our Nation,\r\nwe shall give no people just cause to make war upon us; we hold no\r\nnational prejudices; we entertain no spirit of revenge; we do not hate;\r\nwe do not covet; we dream of no conquest, nor boast of armed prowess.\r\n\r\nIf, despite this attitude, war is again forced upon us, I earnestly hope\r\na way may be found which will unify our individual and collective\r\nstrength and consecrate all America, materially and spiritually, body\r\nand soul, to national defense. I can vision the ideal republic, where\r\nevery man and woman is called under the flag for assignment to duty for\r\nwhatever service, military or civic, the individual is best fitted;\r\nwhere we may call to universal service every plant, agency, or facility,\r\nall in the sublime sacrifice for country, and not one penny of war\r\nprofit shall inure to the benefit of private individual, corporation, or\r\ncombination, but all above the normal shall flow into the defense chest\r\nof the Nation. There is something inherently wrong, something out of\r\naccord with the ideals of representative democracy, when one portion of\r\nour citizenship turns its activities to private gain amid defensive war\r\nwhile another is fighting, sacrificing, or dying for national\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\nOut of such universal service will come a new unity of spirit and\r\npurpose, a new confidence and consecration, which would make our defense\r\nimpregnable, our triumph assured. Then we should have little or no\r\ndisorganization of our economic, industrial, and commercial systems at\r\nhome, no staggering war debts, no swollen fortunes to flout the\r\nsacrifices of our soldiers, no excuse for sedition, no pitiable\r\nslackerism, no outrage of treason. Envy and jealousy would have no soil\r\nfor their menacing development, and revolution would be without the\r\npassion which engenders it.\r\n\r\nA regret for the mistakes of yesterday must not, however, blind us to\r\nthe tasks of today. War never left such an aftermath. There has been\r\nstaggering loss of life and measureless wastage of materials. Nations\r\nare still groping for return to stable ways. Discouraging indebtedness\r\nconfronts us like all the war-torn nations, and these obligations must\r\nbe provided for. No civilization can survive repudiation.\r\n\r\nWe can reduce the abnormal expenditures, and we will. We can strike at\r\nwar taxation, and we must. We must face the grim necessity, with full\r\nknowledge that the task is to be solved, and we must proceed with a full\r\nrealization that no statute enacted by man can repeal the inexorable\r\nlaws of nature. Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too much of\r\ngovernment, and at the same time do for it too little. We contemplate\r\nthe immediate task of putting our public household in order. We need a\r\nrigid and yet sane economy, combined with fiscal justice, and it must be\r\nattended by individual prudence and thrift, which are so essential to\r\nthis trying hour and reassuring for the future.\r\n\r\nThe business world reflects the disturbance of war's reaction. Herein\r\nflows the lifeblood of material existence. The economic mechanism is\r\nintricate and its parts interdependent, and has suffered the shocks and\r\njars incident to abnormal demands, credit inflations, and price\r\nupheavals. The normal balances have been impaired, the channels of\r\ndistribution have been clogged, the relations of labor and management\r\nhave been strained. We must seek the readjustment with care and courage.\r\nOur people must give and take. Prices must reflect the receding fever of\r\nwar activities. Perhaps we never shall know the old levels of wages\r\nagain, because war invariably readjusts compensations, and the\r\nnecessaries of life will show their inseparable relationship, but we\r\nmust strive for normalcy to reach stability. All the penalties will not\r\nbe light, nor evenly distributed. There is no way of making them so.\r\nThere is no instant step from disorder to order. We must face a\r\ncondition of grim reality, charge off our losses and start afresh. It is\r\nthe oldest lesson of civilization. I would like government to do all it\r\ncan to mitigate; then, in understanding, in mutuality of interest, in\r\nconcern for the common good, our tasks will be solved. No altered system\r\nwill work a miracle. Any wild experiment will only add to the confusion.\r\nOur best assurance lies in efficient administration of our proven\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe forward course of the business cycle is unmistakable. Peoples are\r\nturning from destruction to production. Industry has sensed the changed\r\norder and our own people are turning to resume their normal, onward way.\r\nThe call is for productive America to go on. I know that Congress and\r\nthe Administration will favor every wise Government policy to aid the\r\nresumption and encourage continued progress.\r\n\r\nI speak for administrative efficiency, for lightened tax burdens, for\r\nsound commercial practices, for adequate credit facilities, for\r\nsympathetic concern for all agricultural problems, for the omission of\r\nunnecessary interference of Government with business, for an end to\r\nGovernment's experiment in business, and for more efficient business in\r\nGovernment administration. With all of this must attend a mindfulness of\r\nthe human side of all activities, so that social, industrial, and\r\neconomic justice will be squared with the purposes of a righteous\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWith the nation-wide induction of womanhood into our political life, we\r\nmay count upon her intuitions, her refinements, her intelligence, and\r\nher influence to exalt the social order. We count upon her exercise of\r\nthe full privileges and the performance of the duties of citizenship to\r\nspeed the attainment of the highest state.\r\n\r\nI wish for an America no less alert in guarding against dangers from\r\nwithin than it is watchful against enemies from without. Our fundamental\r\nlaw recognizes no class, no group, no section; there must be none in\r\nlegislation or administration. The supreme inspiration is the common\r\nweal. Humanity hungers for international peace, and we crave it with all\r\nmankind. My most reverent prayer for America is for industrial peace,\r\nwith its rewards, widely and generally distributed, amid the\r\ninspirations of equal opportunity. No one justly may deny the equality\r\nof opportunity which made us what we are. We have mistaken\r\nunpreparedness to embrace it to be a challenge of the reality, and due\r\nconcern for making all citizens fit for participation will give added\r\nstrength of citizenship and magnify our achievement.\r\n\r\nIf revolution insists upon overturning established order, let other\r\npeoples make the tragic experiment. There is no place for it in America.\r\nWhen World War threatened civilization we pledged our resources and our\r\nlives to its preservation, and when revolution threatens we unfurl the\r\nflag of law and order and renew our consecration. Ours is a\r\nconstitutional freedom where the popular will is the law supreme and\r\nminorities are sacredly protected. Our revisions, reformations, and\r\nevolutions reflect a deliberate judgment and an orderly progress, and we\r\nmean to cure our ills, but never destroy or permit destruction by force.\r\n\r\nI had rather submit our industrial controversies to the conference table\r\nin advance than to a settlement table after conflict and suffering. The\r\nearth is thirsting for the cup of good will, understanding is its\r\nfountain source. I would like to acclaim an era of good feeling amid\r\ndependable prosperity and all the blessings which attend.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved again and again that we cannot, while throwing our\r\nmarkets open to the world, maintain American standards of living and\r\nopportunity, and hold our industrial eminence in such unequal\r\ncompetition. There is a luring fallacy in the theory of banished\r\nbarriers of trade, but preserved American standards require our higher\r\nproduction costs to be reflected in our tariffs on imports. Today, as\r\nnever before, when peoples are seeking trade restoration and expansion,\r\nwe must adjust our tariffs to the new order. We seek participation in\r\nthe world's exchanges, because therein lies our way to widened influence\r\nand the triumphs of peace. We know full well we cannot sell where we do\r\nnot buy, and we cannot sell successfully where we do not carry.\r\nOpportunity is calling not alone for the restoration, but for a new era\r\nin production, transportation and trade. We shall answer it best by\r\nmeeting the demand of a surpassing home market, by promoting\r\nself-reliance in production, and by bidding enterprise, genius, and\r\nefficiency to carry our cargoes in American bottoms to the marts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe would not have an America living within and for herself alone, but we\r\nwould have her self-reliant, independent, and ever nobler, stronger, and\r\nricher. Believing in our higher standards, reared through constitutional\r\nliberty and maintained opportunity, we invite the world to the same\r\nheights. But pride in things wrought is no reflex of a completed task.\r\nCommon welfare is the goal of our national endeavor. Wealth is not\r\ninimical to welfare; it ought to be its friendliest agency. There never\r\ncan be equality of rewards or possessions so long as the human plan\r\ncontains varied talents and differing degrees of industry and thrift,\r\nbut ours ought to be a country free from the great blotches of\r\ndistressed poverty. We ought to find a way to guard against the perils\r\nand penalties of unemployment. We want an America of homes, illumined\r\nwith hope and happiness, where mothers, freed from the necessity for\r\nlong hours of toil beyond their own doors, may preside as befits the\r\nhearthstone of American citizenship. We want the cradle of American\r\nchildhood rocked under conditions so wholesome and so hopeful that no\r\nblight may touch it in its development, and we want to provide that no\r\nselfish interest, no material necessity, no lack of opportunity shall\r\nprevent the gaining of that education so essential to best citizenship.\r\n\r\nThere is no short cut to the making of these ideals into glad realities.\r\nThe world has witnessed again and again the futility and the mischief of\r\nill-considered remedies for social and economic disorders. But we are\r\nmindful today as never before of the friction of modern industrialism,\r\nand we must learn its causes and reduce its evil consequences by sober\r\nand tested methods. Where genius has made for great possibilities,\r\njustice and happiness must be reflected in a greater common welfare.\r\n\r\nService is the supreme commitment of life. I would rejoice to acclaim\r\nthe era of the Golden Rule and crown it with the autocracy of service. I\r\npledge an administration wherein all the agencies of Government are\r\ncalled to serve, and ever promote an understanding of Government purely\r\nas an expression of the popular will.\r\n\r\nOne cannot stand in this presence and be unmindful of the tremendous\r\nresponsibility. The world upheaval has added heavily to our tasks. But\r\nwith the realization comes the surge of high resolve, and there is\r\nreassurance in belief in the God-given destiny of our Republic. If I\r\nfelt that there is to be sole responsibility in the Executive for the\r\nAmerica of tomorrow I should shrink from the burden. But here are a\r\nhundred millions, with common concern and shared responsibility,\r\nanswerable to God and country. The Republic summons them to their duty,\r\nand I invite co-operation.\r\n\r\nI accept my part with single-mindedness of purpose and humility of\r\nspirit, and implore the favor and guidance of God in His Heaven. With\r\nthese I am unafraid, and confidently face the future.\r\n\r\nI have taken the solemn oath of office on that passage of Holy Writ\r\nwherein it is asked: \"What doth the Lord require of thee but to do\r\njustly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?\" This I\r\nplight to God and country.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCALVIN COOLIDGE, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 4, 1925\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  In 1923 President Coolidge first took the oath of\r\noffice, administered by his father, a justice of the peace and a notary,\r\nin his family's sitting room in Plymouth, Vermont. President Harding had\r\ndied while traveling in the western States. A year later, the President\r\nwas elected on the slogan \"Keep Cool with Coolidge.\" Chief Justice\r\nWilliam Howard Taft administered the oath of office on the East Portico\r\nof the Capitol. The event was broadcast to the nation by radio.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Countrymen:\r\n\r\nNo one can contemplate current conditions without finding much that is\r\nsatisfying and still more that is encouraging. Our own country is\r\nleading the world in the general readjustment to the results of the\r\ngreat conflict. Many of its burdens will bear heavily upon us for years,\r\nand the secondary and indirect effects we must expect to experience for\r\nsome time. But we are beginning to comprehend more definitely what\r\ncourse should be pursued, what remedies ought to be applied, what\r\nactions should be taken for our deliverance, and are clearly manifesting\r\na determined will faithfully and conscientiously to adopt these methods\r\nof relief. Already we have sufficiently rearranged our domestic affairs\r\nso that confidence has returned, business has revived, and we appear to\r\nbe entering an era of prosperity which is gradually reaching into every\r\npart of the Nation. Realizing that we can not live unto ourselves alone,\r\nwe have contributed of our resources and our counsel to the relief of\r\nthe suffering and the settlement of the disputes among the European\r\nnations. Because of what America is and what America has done, a firmer\r\ncourage, a higher hope, inspires the heart of all humanity.\r\n\r\nThese results have not occurred by mere chance. They have been secured\r\nby a constant and enlightened effort marked by many sacrifices and\r\nextending over many generations. We can not continue these brilliant\r\nsuccesses in the future, unless we continue to learn from the past. It\r\nis necessary to keep the former experiences of our country both at home\r\nand abroad continually before us, if we are to have any science of\r\ngovernment. If we wish to erect new structures, we must have a definite\r\nknowledge of the old foundations. We must realize that human nature is\r\nabout the most constant thing in the universe and that the essentials of\r\nhuman relationship do not change. We must frequently take our bearings\r\nfrom these fixed stars of our political firmament if we expect to hold a\r\ntrue course. If we examine carefully what we have done, we can determine\r\nthe more accurately what we can do.\r\n\r\nWe stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since our\r\nnational consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action with\r\nan array of force. The old sentiment of detached and dependent colonies\r\ndisappeared in the new sentiment of a united and independent Nation. Men\r\nbegan to discard the narrow confines of a local charter for the broader\r\nopportunities of a national constitution. Under the eternal urge of\r\nfreedom we became an independent Nation. A little less than 50 years\r\nlater that freedom and independence were reasserted in the face of all\r\nthe world, and guarded, supported, and secured by the Monroe doctrine.\r\nThe narrow fringe of States along the Atlantic seaboard advanced its\r\nfrontiers across the hills and plains of an intervening continent until\r\nit passed down the golden slope to the Pacific. We made freedom a\r\nbirthright. We extended our domain over distant islands in order to\r\nsafeguard our own interests and accepted the consequent obligation to\r\nbestow justice and liberty upon less favored peoples. In the defense of\r\nour own ideals and in the general cause of liberty we entered the Great\r\nWar. When victory had been fully secured, we withdrew to our own shores\r\nunrecompensed save in the consciousness of duty done.\r\n\r\nThroughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom, we have\r\nstrengthened our independence. We have been, and propose to be, more and\r\nmore American. We believe that we can best serve our own country and\r\nmost successfully discharge our obligations to humanity by continuing to\r\nbe openly and candidly, in tensely and scrupulously, American. If we\r\nhave any heritage, it has been that. If we have any destiny, we have\r\nfound it in that direction.\r\n\r\nBut if we wish to continue to be distinctively American, we must\r\ncontinue to make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the\r\nlegitimate desires of a civilized and enlightened people determined in\r\nall their relations to pursue a conscientious and religious life. We can\r\nnot permit ourselves to be narrowed and dwarfed by slogans and phrases.\r\nIt is not the adjective, but the substantive, which is of real\r\nimportance. It is not the name of the action, but the result of the\r\naction, which is the chief concern. It will be well not to be too much\r\ndisturbed by the thought of either isolation or entanglement of\r\npacifists and militarists. The physical configuration of the earth has\r\nseparated us from all of the Old World, but the common brotherhood of\r\nman, the highest law of all our being, has united us by inseparable\r\nbonds with all humanity. Our country represents nothing but peaceful\r\nintentions toward all the earth, but it ought not to fail to maintain\r\nsuch a military force as comports with the dignity and security of a\r\ngreat people. It ought to be a balanced force, intensely modern, capable\r\nof defense by sea and land, beneath the surface and in the air. But it\r\nshould be so conducted that all the world may see in it, not a menace,\r\nbut an instrument of security and peace.\r\n\r\nThis Nation believes thoroughly in an honorable peace under which the\r\nrights of its citizens are to be everywhere protected. It has never\r\nfound that the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintained\r\nonly by a great and threatening array of arms. In common with other\r\nnations, it is now more determined than ever to promote peace through\r\nfriendliness and good will, through mutual understandings and mutual\r\nforbearance. We have never practiced the policy of competitive\r\narmaments. We have recently committed ourselves by covenants with the\r\nother great nations to a limitation of our sea power. As one result of\r\nthis, our Navy ranks larger, in comparison, than it ever did before.\r\nRemoving the burden of expense and jealousy, which must always accrue\r\nfrom a keen rivalry, is one of the most effective methods of diminishing\r\nthat unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which are the most\r\npotent means of fomenting war. This policy represents a new departure in\r\nthe world. It is a thought, an ideal, which has led to an entirely new\r\nline of action. It will not be easy to maintain. Some never moved from\r\ntheir old positions, some are constantly slipping back to the old ways\r\nof thought and the old action of seizing a musket and relying on force.\r\nAmerica has taken the lead in this new direction, and that lead America\r\nmust continue to hold. If we expect others to rely on our fairness and\r\njustice we must show that we rely on their fairness and justice.\r\n\r\nIf we are to judge by past experience, there is much to be hoped for in\r\ninternational relations from frequent conferences and consultations. We\r\nhave before us the beneficial results of the Washington conference and\r\nthe various consultations recently held upon European affairs, some of\r\nwhich were in response to our suggestions and in some of which we were\r\nactive participants. Even the failures can not but be accounted useful\r\nand an immeasurable advance over threatened or actual warfare. I am\r\nstrongly in favor of continuation of this policy, whenever conditions\r\nare such that there is even a promise that practical and favorable\r\nresults might be secured.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather than a\r\nthreat of force should be the determining factor in the intercourse\r\namong nations, we have long advocated the peaceful settlement of\r\ndisputes by methods of arbitration and have negotiated many treaties to\r\nsecure that result. The same considerations should lead to our adherence\r\nto the Permanent Court of International Justice. Where great principles\r\nare involved, where great movements are under way which promise much for\r\nthe welfare of humanity by reason of the very fact that many other\r\nnations have given such movements their actual support, we ought not to\r\nwithhold our own sanction because of any small and inessential\r\ndifference, but only upon the ground of the most important and\r\ncompelling fundamental reasons. We can not barter away our independence\r\nor our sovereignty, but we ought to engage in no refinements of logic,\r\nno sophistries, and no subterfuges, to argue away the undoubted duty of\r\nthis country by reason of the might of its numbers, the power of its\r\nresources, and its position of leadership in the world, actively and\r\ncomprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of\r\nthe responsibility of a candid and disinterested attempt at the\r\nestablishment of a tribunal for the administration of even-handed\r\njustice between nation and nation. The weight of our enormous influence\r\nmust be cast upon the side of a reign not of force but of law and trial,\r\nnot by battle but by reason.\r\n\r\nWe have never any wish to interfere in the political conditions of any\r\nother countries. Especially are we determined not to become implicated\r\nin the political controversies of the Old World. With a great deal of\r\nhesitation, we have responded to appeals for help to maintain order,\r\nprotect life and property, and establish responsible government in some\r\nof the small countries of the Western Hemisphere. Our private citizens\r\nhave advanced large sums of money to assist in the necessary financing\r\nand relief of the Old World. We have not failed, nor shall we fail to\r\nrespond, whenever necessary to mitigate human suffering and assist in\r\nthe rehabilitation of distressed nations. These, too, are requirements\r\nwhich must be met by reason of our vast powers and the place we hold in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nSome of the best thought of mankind has long been seeking for a formula\r\nfor permanent peace. Undoubtedly the clarification of the principles of\r\ninternational law would be helpful, and the efforts of scholars to\r\nprepare such a work for adoption by the various nations should have our\r\nsympathy and support. Much may be hoped for from the earnest studies of\r\nthose who advocate the outlawing of aggressive war. But all these plans\r\nand preparations, these treaties and covenants, will not of themselves\r\nbe adequate. One of the greatest dangers to peace lies in the economic\r\npressure to which people find themselves subjected. One of the most\r\npractical things to be done in the world is to seek arrangements under\r\nwhich such pressure may be removed, so that opportunity may be renewed\r\nand hope may be revived. There must be some assurance that effort and\r\nendeavor will be followed by success and prosperity. In the making and\r\nfinancing of such adjustments there is not only an opportunity, but a\r\nreal duty, for America to respond with her counsel and her resources.\r\nConditions must be provided under which people can make a living and\r\nwork out of their difficulties. But there is another element, more\r\nimportant than all, without which there can not be the slightest hope of\r\na permanent peace. That element lies in the heart of humanity. Unless\r\nthe desire for peace be cherished there, unless this fundamental and\r\nonly natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highest\r\ndegree, all artificial efforts will be in vain. Peace will come when\r\nthere is realization that only under a reign of law, based on\r\nrighteousness and supported by the religious conviction of the\r\nbrotherhood of man, can there be any hope of a complete and satisfying\r\nlife. Parchment will fail, the sword will fail, it is only the spiritual\r\nnature of man that can be triumphant.\r\n\r\nIt seems altogether probable that we can contribute most to these\r\nimportant objects by maintaining our position of political detachment\r\nand independence. We are not identified with any Old World interests.\r\nThis position should be made more and more clear in our relations with\r\nall foreign countries. We are at peace with all of them. Our program is\r\nnever to oppress, but always to assist. But while we do justice to\r\nothers, we must require that justice be done to us. With us a treaty of\r\npeace means peace, and a treaty of amity means amity. We have made great\r\ncontributions to the settlement of contentious differences in both\r\nEurope and Asia. But there is a very definite point beyond which we can\r\nnot go. We can only help those who help themselves. Mindful of these\r\nlimitations, the one great duty that stands out requires us to use our\r\nenormous powers to trim the balance of the world.\r\n\r\nWhile we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have done\r\nabroad, we must remember that our continued success in that direction\r\ndepends upon what we do at home. Since its very outset, it has been\r\nfound necessary to conduct our Government by means of political parties.\r\nThat system would not have survived from generation to generation if it\r\nhad not been fundamentally sound and provided the best instrumentalities\r\nfor the most complete expression of the popular will. It is not\r\nnecessary to claim that it has always worked perfectly. It is enough to\r\nknow that nothing better has been devised. No one would deny that there\r\nshould be full and free expression and an opportunity for independence\r\nof action within the party. There is no salvation in a narrow and\r\nbigoted partisanship. But if there is to be responsible party\r\ngovernment, the party label must be something more than a mere device\r\nfor securing office. Unless those who are elected under the same party\r\ndesignation are willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit\r\nsufficient loyalty and coherence, so that they can cooperate with each\r\nother in the support of the broad general principles, of the party\r\nplatform, the election is merely a mockery, no decision is made at the\r\npolls, and there is no representation of the popular will. Common\r\nhonesty and good faith with the people who support a party at the polls\r\nrequire that party, when it enters office, to assume the control of that\r\nportion of the Government to which it has been elected. Any other course\r\nis bad faith and a violation of the party pledges.\r\n\r\nWhen the country has bestowed its confidence upon a party by making it a\r\nmajority in the Congress, it has a right to expect such unity of action\r\nas will make the party majority an effective instrument of government.\r\nThis Administration has come into power with a very clear and definite\r\nmandate from the people. The expression of the popular will in favor of\r\nmaintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisive.\r\nThere was a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courts\r\nthat we can consider that issue rejected for some time to come.\r\nLikewise, the policy of public ownership of railroads and certain\r\nelectric utilities met with unmistakable defeat. The people declared\r\nthat they wanted their rights to have not a political but a judicial\r\ndetermination, and their independence and freedom continued and\r\nsupported by having the ownership and control of their property, not in\r\nthe Government, but in their own hands. As they always do when they have\r\na fair chance, the people demonstrated that they are sound and are\r\ndetermined to have a sound government.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted, the\r\npolicy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy in\r\npublic expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation. The principle\r\ninvolved in this effort is that of conservation. The resources of this\r\ncountry are almost beyond computation. No mind can comprehend them. But\r\nthe cost of our combined governments is likewise almost beyond\r\ndefinition. Not only those who are now making their tax returns, but\r\nthose who meet the enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills,\r\nknow by hard experience what this great burden is and what it does. No\r\nmatter what others may want, these people want a drastic economy. They\r\nare opposed to waste. They know that extravagance lengthens the hours\r\nand diminishes the rewards of their labor. I favor the policy of\r\neconomy, not because I wish to save money, but because I wish to save\r\npeople. The men and women of this country who toil are the ones who bear\r\nthe cost of the Government. Every dollar that we carelessly waste means\r\nthat their life will be so much the more meager. Every dollar that we\r\nprudently save means that their life will be so much the more abundant.\r\nEconomy is idealism in its most practical form.\r\n\r\nIf extravagance were not reflected in taxation, and through taxation\r\nboth directly and indirectly injuriously affecting the people, it would\r\nnot be of so much consequence. The wisest and soundest method of solving\r\nour tax problem is through economy. Fortunately, of all the great\r\nnations this country is best in a position to adopt that simple remedy.\r\nWe do not any longer need wartime revenues. The collection of any taxes\r\nwhich are not absolutely required, which do not beyond reasonable doubt\r\ncontribute to the public welfare, is only a species of legalized\r\nlarceny. Under this republic the rewards of industry belong to those who\r\nearn them. The only constitutional tax is the tax which ministers to\r\npublic necessity. The property of the country belongs to the people of\r\nthe country. Their title is absolute. They do not support any privileged\r\nclass; they do not need to maintain great military forces; they ought\r\nnot to be burdened with a great array of public employees. They are not\r\nrequired to make any contribution to Government expenditures except that\r\nwhich they voluntarily assess upon themselves through the action of\r\ntheir own representatives. Whenever taxes become burdensome a remedy can\r\nbe applied by the people; but if they do not act for themselves, no one\r\ncan be very successful in acting for them.\r\n\r\nThe time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction, when,\r\nunless we wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living, we\r\nmust have tax reform. The method of raising revenue ought not to impede\r\nthe transaction of business; it ought to encourage it. I am opposed to\r\nextremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because\r\nthey are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong. We\r\ncan not finance the country, we can not improve social conditions,\r\nthrough any system of injustice, even if we attempt to inflict it upon\r\nthe rich. Those who suffer the most harm will be the poor. This country\r\nbelieves in prosperity. It is absurd to suppose that it is envious of\r\nthose who are already prosperous. The wise and correct course to follow\r\nin taxation and all other economic legislation is not to destroy those\r\nwho have already secured success but to create conditions under which\r\nevery one will have a better chance to be successful. The verdict of the\r\ncountry has been given on this question. That verdict stands. We shall\r\ndo well to heed it.\r\n\r\nThese questions involve moral issues. We need not concern ourselves much\r\nabout the rights of property if we will faithfully observe the rights of\r\npersons. Under our institutions their rights are supreme. It is not\r\nproperty but the right to hold property, both great and small, which our\r\nConstitution guarantees. All owners of property are charged with a\r\nservice. These rights and duties have been revealed, through the\r\nconscience of society, to have a divine sanction. The very stability of\r\nour society rests upon production and conservation. For individuals or\r\nfor governments to waste and squander their resources is to deny these\r\nrights and disregard these obligations. The result of economic\r\ndissipation to a nation is always moral decay.\r\n\r\nThese policies of better international understandings, greater economy,\r\nand lower taxes have contributed largely to peaceful and prosperous\r\nindustrial relations. Under the helpful influences of restrictive\r\nimmigration and a protective tariff, employment is plentiful, the rate\r\nof pay is high, and wage earners are in a state of contentment seldom\r\nbefore seen. Our transportation systems have been gradually recovering\r\nand have been able to meet all the requirements of the service.\r\nAgriculture has been very slow in reviving, but the price of cereals at\r\nlast indicates that the day of its deliverance is at hand.\r\n\r\nWe are not without our problems, but our most important problem is not\r\nto secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess.\r\nOur system of government made up of three separate and independent\r\ndepartments, our divided sovereignty composed of Nation and State, the\r\nmatchless wisdom that is enshrined in our Constitution, all these need\r\nconstant effort and tireless vigilance for their protection and support.\r\n\r\nIn a republic the first rule for the guidance of the citizen is\r\nobedience to law. Under a despotism the law may be imposed upon the\r\nsubject. He has no voice in its making, no influence in its\r\nadministration, it does not represent him. Under a free government the\r\ncitizen makes his own laws, chooses his own administrators, which do\r\nrepresent him. Those who want their rights respected under the\r\nConstitution and the law ought to set the example themselves of\r\nobserving the Constitution and the law. While there may be those of high\r\nintelligence who violate the law at times, the barbarian and the\r\ndefective always violate it. Those who disregard the rules of society\r\nare not exhibiting a superior intelligence, are not promoting freedom\r\nand independence, are not following the path of civilization, but are\r\ndisplaying the traits of ignorance, of servitude, of savagery, and\r\ntreading the way that leads back to the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe essence of a republic is representative government. Our Congress\r\nrepresents the people and the States. In all legislative affairs it is\r\nthe natural collaborator with the President. In spite of all the\r\ncriticism which often falls to its lot, I do not hesitate to say that\r\nthere is no more independent and effective legislative body in the\r\nworld. It is, and should be, jealous of its prerogative. I welcome its\r\ncooperation, and expect to share with it not only the responsibility,\r\nbut the credit, for our common effort to secure beneficial legislation.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the principles which America represents. We have not\r\nby any means put them fully into practice, but we have strongly\r\nsignified our belief in them. The encouraging feature of our country is\r\nnot that it has reached its destination, but that it has overwhelmingly\r\nexpressed its determination to proceed in the right direction. It is\r\ntrue that we could, with profit, be less sectional and more national in\r\nour thought. It would be well if we could replace much that is only a\r\nfalse and ignorant prejudice with a true and enlightened pride of race.\r\nBut the last election showed that appeals to class and nationality had\r\nlittle effect. We were all found loyal to a common citizenship. The\r\nfundamental precept of liberty is toleration. We can not permit any\r\ninquisition either within or without the law or apply any religious test\r\nto the holding of office. The mind of America must be forever free.\r\n\r\nIt is in such contemplations, my fellow countrymen, which are not\r\nexhaustive but only representative, that I find ample warrant for\r\nsatisfaction and encouragement. We should not let the much that is to do\r\nobscure the much which has been done. The past and present show faith\r\nand hope and courage fully justified. Here stands our country, an\r\nexample of tranquillity at home, a patron of tranquillity abroad. Here\r\nstands its Government, aware of its might but obedient to its\r\nconscience. Here it will continue to stand, seeking peace and\r\nprosperity, solicitous for the welfare of the wage earner, promoting\r\nenterprise, developing waterways and natural resources, attentive to the\r\nintuitive counsel of womanhood, encouraging education, desiring the\r\nadvancement of religion, supporting the cause of justice and honor among\r\nthe nations. America seeks no earthly empire built on blood and force.\r\nNo ambition, no temptation, lures her to thought of foreign dominions.\r\nThe legions which she sends forth are armed, not with the sword, but\r\nwith the cross. The higher state to which she seeks the allegiance of\r\nall mankind is not of human, but of divine origin. She cherishes no\r\npurpose save to merit the favor of Almighty God.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBERT HOOVER, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, MARCH 4, 1929\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  Popular opinion for the engineer, humanitarian, and\r\nSecretary of Commerce brought the President-elect to office with\r\nexpectations of continued national growth and prosperity. Chief Justice\r\nWilliam Howard Taft administered the oath of office on the East Portico\r\nof the Capitol. On taking his first elective office, the new President\r\naddressed a large crowd in the drizzling rain. Dirigibles and aircraft\r\nflew over the Capitol to mark the occasion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Countrymen:\r\n\r\nThis occasion is not alone the administration of the most sacred oath\r\nwhich can be assumed by an American citizen. It is a dedication and\r\nconsecration under God to the highest office in service of our people. I\r\nassume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the\r\nguidance of Almighty Providence can I hope to discharge its\r\never-increasing burdens.\r\n\r\nIt is in keeping with tradition throughout our history that I should\r\nexpress simply and directly the opinions which I hold concerning some of\r\nthe matters of present importance.\r\n\r\nOUR PROGRESS\r\n\r\nIf we survey the situation of our Nation both at home and abroad, we\r\nfind many satisfactions; we find some causes for concern. We have\r\nemerged from the losses of the Great War and the reconstruction\r\nfollowing it with increased virility and strength. From this strength we\r\nhave contributed to the recovery and progress of the world. What America\r\nhas done has given renewed hope and courage to all who have faith in\r\ngovernment by the people. In the large view, we have reached a higher\r\ndegree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history\r\nof the world. Through liberation from widespread poverty we have reached\r\na higher degree of individual freedom than ever before. The devotion to\r\nand concern for our institutions are deep and sincere. We are steadily\r\nbuilding a new race--a new civilization great in its own attainments.\r\nThe influence and high purposes of our Nation are respected among the\r\npeoples of the world. We aspire to distinction in the world, but to a\r\ndistinction based upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our\r\naccomplishments within our own borders and in our own lives. For wise\r\nguidance in this great period of recovery the Nation is deeply indebted\r\nto Calvin Coolidge.\r\n\r\nBut all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers\r\nfrom which self-government must be safeguarded. The strong man must at\r\nall times be alert to the attack of insidious disease.\r\n\r\nTHE FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEM OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE\r\n\r\nThe most malign of all these dangers today is disregard and disobedience\r\nof law. Crime is increasing. Confidence in rigid and speedy justice is\r\ndecreasing. I am not prepared to believe that this indicates any decay\r\nin the moral fiber of the American people. I am not prepared to believe\r\nthat it indicates an impotence of the Federal Government to enforce its\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nIt is only in part due to the additional burdens imposed upon our\r\njudicial system by the eighteenth amendment. The problem is much wider\r\nthan that. Many influences had increasingly complicated and weakened our\r\nlaw enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nTo reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must\r\ncritically consider the entire Federal machinery of justice, the\r\nredistribution of its functions, the simplification of its procedure,\r\nthe provision of additional special tribunals, the better selection of\r\njuries, and the more effective organization of our agencies of\r\ninvestigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may\r\nbe swift. While the authority of the Federal Government extends to but\r\npart of our vast system of national, State, and local justice, yet the\r\nstandards which the Federal Government establishes have the most\r\nprofound influence upon the whole structure.\r\n\r\nWe are fortunate in the ability and integrity of our Federal judges and\r\nattorneys. But the system which these officers are called upon to\r\nadminister is in many respects ill adapted to present-day conditions.\r\nIts intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of\r\nboth big and little criminals. There is a belief abroad that by invoking\r\ntechnicalities, subterfuge, and delay, the ends of justice may be\r\nthwarted by those who can pay the cost.\r\n\r\nReform, reorganization and strengthening of our whole judicial and\r\nenforcement system, both in civil and criminal sides, have been\r\nadvocated for years by statesmen, judges, and bar associations. First\r\nsteps toward that end should not longer be delayed. Rigid and\r\nexpeditious justice is the first safeguard of freedom, the basis of all\r\nordered liberty, the vital force of progress. It must not come to be in\r\nour Republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen,\r\nby exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law, or by\r\ncombinations of criminals. Justice must not fail because the agencies of\r\nenforcement are either delinquent or inefficiently organized. To\r\nconsider these evils, to find their remedy, is the most sore necessity\r\nof our times.\r\n\r\nENFORCEMENT OF THE EIGHTEENTH AMENDMENT\r\n\r\nOf the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth\r\namendment, part are due to the causes I have just mentioned; but part\r\nare due to the failure of some States to accept their share of\r\nresponsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many\r\nState and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of\r\noffice zealously to enforce the laws. With the failures from these many\r\ncauses has come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have\r\nfound enlarged opportunities in dealing in illegal liquor.\r\n\r\nBut a large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens. There would\r\nbe little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronized it. We\r\nmust awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of\r\nlaw-abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime.\r\n\r\nI have been selected by you to execute and enforce the laws of the\r\ncountry. I propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities, but the\r\nmeasure of success that the Government shall attain will depend upon the\r\nmoral support which you, as citizens, extend. The duty of citizens to\r\nsupport the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their\r\nGovernment to enforce the laws which exist. No greater national service\r\ncan be given by men and women of good will--who, I know, are not\r\nunmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship--than that they should,\r\nby their example, assist in stamping out crime and outlawry by refusing\r\nparticipation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor.\r\nOur whole system of self-government will crumble either if officials\r\nelect what laws they will enforce or citizens elect what laws they will\r\nsupport. The worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys\r\nrespect for all law. For our citizens to patronize the violation of a\r\nparticular law on the ground that they are opposed to it is destructive\r\nof the very basis of all that protection of life, of homes and property\r\nwhich they rightly claim under other laws. If citizens do not like a\r\nlaw, their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation;\r\ntheir right is openly to work for its repeal.\r\n\r\nTo those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous\r\nenforcement of the law. Fortunately they are but a small percentage of\r\nour people. Their activities must be stopped.\r\n\r\nA NATIONAL INVESTIGATION\r\n\r\nI propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation\r\nof the whole structure of our Federal system of jurisprudence, to\r\ninclude the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the\r\ncauses of abuse under it. Its purpose will be to make such\r\nrecommendations for reorganization of the administration of Federal laws\r\nand court procedure as may be found desirable. In the meantime it is\r\nessential that a large part of the enforcement activities be transferred\r\nfrom the Treasury Department to the Department of Justice as a beginning\r\nof more effective organization.\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION OF GOVERNMENT TO BUSINESS\r\n\r\nThe election has again confirmed the determination of the American\r\npeople that regulation of private enterprise and not Government\r\nownership or operation is the course rightly to be pursued in our\r\nrelation to business. In recent years we have established a\r\ndifferentiation in the whole method of business regulation between the\r\nindustries which produce and distribute commodities on the one hand and\r\npublic utilities on the other. In the former, our laws insist upon\r\neffective competition; in the latter, because we substantially confer a\r\nmonopoly by limiting competition, we must regulate their services and\r\nrates. The rigid enforcement of the laws applicable to both groups is\r\nthe very base of equal opportunity and freedom from domination for all\r\nour people, and it is just as essential for the stability and prosperity\r\nof business itself as for the protection of the public at large. Such\r\nregulation should be extended by the Federal Government within the\r\nlimitations of the Constitution and only when the individual States are\r\nwithout power to protect their citizens through their own authority. On\r\nthe other hand, we should be fearless when the authority rests only in\r\nthe Federal Government.\r\n\r\nCOOPERATION BY THE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nThe larger purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more\r\nfirmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby\r\nremove poverty still further from our borders. Our people have in recent\r\nyears developed a new-found capacity for cooperation among themselves to\r\neffect high purposes in public welfare. It is an advance toward the\r\nhighest conception of self-government. Self-government does not and\r\nshould not imply the use of political agencies alone. Progress is born\r\nof cooperation in the community--not from governmental restraints. The\r\nGovernment should assist and encourage these movements of collective\r\nself-help by itself cooperating with them. Business has by cooperation\r\nmade great progress in the advancement of service, in stability, in\r\nregularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuses. Such\r\nprogress, however, can continue only so long as business manifests its\r\nrespect for law.\r\n\r\nThere is an equally important field of cooperation by the Federal\r\nGovernment with the multitude of agencies, State, municipal and private,\r\nin the systematic development of those processes which directly affect\r\npublic health, recreation, education, and the home. We have need further\r\nto perfect the means by which Government can be adapted to human\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nAlthough education is primarily a responsibility of the States and local\r\ncommunities, and rightly so, yet the Nation as a whole is vitally\r\nconcerned in its development everywhere to the highest standards and to\r\ncomplete universality. Self-government can succeed only through an\r\ninstructed electorate. Our objective is not simply to overcome\r\nilliteracy. The Nation has marched far beyond that. The more complex the\r\nproblems of the Nation become, the greater is the need for more and more\r\nadvanced instruction. Moreover, as our numbers increase and as our life\r\nexpands with science and invention, we must discover more and more\r\nleaders for every walk of life. We can not hope to succeed in directing\r\nthis increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent\r\nof leadership from the whole people. One civilization after another has\r\nbeen wrecked upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a\r\nsingle group or class. If we would prevent the growth of class\r\ndistinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals\r\nof our people, we must draw constantly from the general mass. The full\r\nopportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective\r\nprocesses of education can alone secure to us this leadership.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC HEALTH\r\n\r\nIn public health the discoveries of science have opened a new era. Many\r\nsections of our country and many groups of our citizens suffer from\r\ndiseases the eradication of which are mere matters of administration and\r\nmoderate expenditure. Public health service should be as fully organized\r\nand as universally incorporated into our governmental system as is\r\npublic education. The returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits,\r\nand infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nWORLD PEACE\r\n\r\nThe United States fully accepts the profound truth that our own\r\nprogress, prosperity, and peace are interlocked with the progress,\r\nprosperity, and peace of all humanity. The whole world is at peace. The\r\ndangers to a continuation of this peace to-day are largely the fear and\r\nsuspicion which still haunt the world. No suspicion or fear can be\r\nrightly directed toward our country.\r\n\r\nThose who have a true understanding of America know that we have no\r\ndesire for territorial expansion, for economic or other domination of\r\nother peoples. Such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human\r\nfreedom. Our form of government is ill adapted to the responsibilities\r\nwhich inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of\r\nother peoples. Superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our\r\nabounding increase in population, in wealth and power except that of\r\nimperialism. They fail to see that the American people are engrossed in\r\nthe building for themselves of a new economic system, a new social\r\nsystem, a new political system all of which are characterized by\r\naspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby are the negation of\r\nimperialism. They fail to realize that because of our abounding\r\nprosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of\r\nlearning; that our people are seeking a larger vision through art,\r\nliterature, science, and travel; that they are moving toward stronger\r\nmoral and spiritual life--that from these things our sympathies are\r\nbroadening beyond the bounds of our Nation and race toward their true\r\nexpression in a real brotherhood of man. They fail to see that the\r\nidealism of America will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel, but\r\ninspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of\r\ncivilization. It will do that not by mere declaration but by taking a\r\npractical part in supporting all useful international undertakings. We\r\nnot only desire peace with the world, but to see peace maintained\r\nthroughout the world. We wish to advance the reign of justice and reason\r\ntoward the extinction of force.\r\n\r\nThe recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of\r\nnational policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the\r\nrelations of nations. Its acceptance should pave the way to greater\r\nlimitation of armament, the offer of which we sincerely extend to the\r\nworld. But its full realization also implies a greater and greater\r\nperfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of\r\ncontroversies between nations. In the creation and use of these\r\ninstrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation,\r\narbitration, and judicial settlement. American statesmen were among the\r\nfirst to propose and they have constantly urged upon the world, the\r\nestablishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a\r\njusticiable character. The Permanent Court of International Justice in\r\nits major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with American ideals and\r\nwith American statesmanship. No more potent instrumentality for this\r\npurpose has ever been conceived and no other is practicable of\r\nestablishment. The reservations placed upon our adherence should not be\r\nmisinterpreted. The United States seeks by these reservations no special\r\nprivilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory\r\nopinions and other matters which are subsidiary to the major purpose of\r\nthe court. The way should, and I believe will, be found by which we may\r\ntake our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nOur people have determined that we should make no political engagements\r\nsuch as membership in the League of Nations, which may commit us in\r\nadvance as a nation to become involved in the settlements of\r\ncontroversies between other countries. They adhere to the belief that\r\nthe independence of America from such obligations increases its ability\r\nand availability for service in all fields of human progress.\r\n\r\nI have lately returned from a journey among our sister Republics of the\r\nWestern Hemisphere. I have received unbounded hospitality and courtesy\r\nas their expression of friendliness to our country. We are held by\r\nparticular bonds of sympathy and common interest with them. They are\r\neach of them building a racial character and a culture which is an\r\nimpressive contribution to human progress. We wish only for the\r\nmaintenance of their independence, the growth of their stability, and\r\ntheir prosperity. While we have had wars in the Western Hemisphere, yet\r\non the whole the record is in encouraging contrast with that of other\r\nparts of the world. Fortunately the New World is largely free from the\r\ninheritances of fear and distrust which have so troubled the Old World.\r\nWe should keep it so.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, my countrymen, to speak of peace without profound\r\nemotion. In thousands of homes in America, in millions of homes around\r\nthe world, there are vacant chairs. It would be a shameful confession of\r\nour unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandoned the hope\r\nfor which all these men died. Surely civilization is old enough, surely\r\nmankind is mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a\r\nway to permanent peace. Abroad, to west and east, are nations whose sons\r\nmingled their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields. Most\r\nof these nations have contributed to our race, to our culture, our\r\nknowledge, and our progress. From one of them we derive our very\r\nlanguage and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions.\r\nTheir desire for peace is as deep and sincere as our own.\r\n\r\nPeace can be contributed to by respect for our ability in defense. Peace\r\ncan be promoted by the limitation of arms and by the creation of the\r\ninstrumentalities for peaceful settlement of controversies. But it will\r\nbecome a reality only through self-restraint and active effort in\r\nfriendliness and helpfulness. I covet for this administration a record\r\nof having further contributed to advance the cause of peace.\r\n\r\nPARTY RESPONSIBILITIES\r\n\r\nIn our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be\r\neffected only through the instrumentality of political parties. We\r\nmaintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but\r\nbecause opportunity must be given for expression of the popular will,\r\nand organization provided for the execution of its mandates and for\r\naccountability of government to the people. It follows that the\r\ngovernment both in the executive and the legislative branches must carry\r\nout in good faith the platforms upon which the party was entrusted with\r\npower. But the government is that of the whole people; the party is the\r\ninstrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring\r\nthem into being. The animosities of elections should have no place in\r\nour Government, for government must concern itself alone with the common\r\nweal.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SESSION OF THE CONGRESS\r\n\r\nAction upon some of the proposals upon which the Republican Party was\r\nreturned to power, particularly further agricultural relief and limited\r\nchanges in the tariff, cannot in justice to our farmers, our labor, and\r\nour manufacturers be postponed. I shall therefore request a special\r\nsession of Congress for the consideration of these two questions. I\r\nshall deal with each of them upon the assembly of the Congress.\r\n\r\nOTHER MANDATES FROM THE ELECTION\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that the more important further mandates from the\r\nrecent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the\r\nConstitution; the vigorous enforcement of the laws; the continuance of\r\neconomy in public expenditure; the continued regulation of business to\r\nprevent domination in the community; the denial of ownership or\r\noperation of business by the Government in competition with its\r\ncitizens; the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the\r\ncontroversies of foreign nations; the more effective reorganization of\r\nthe departments of the Federal Government; the expansion of public\r\nworks; and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and\r\nthe home.\r\n\r\nThese were the more tangible determinations of the election, but beyond\r\nthem was the confidence and belief of the people that we would not\r\nneglect the support of the embedded ideals and aspirations of America.\r\nThese ideals and aspirations are the touchstones upon which the\r\nday-to-day administration and legislative acts of government must be\r\ntested. More than this, the Government must, so far as lies within its\r\nproper powers, give leadership to the realization of these ideals and to\r\nthe fruition of these aspirations. No one can adequately reduce these\r\nthings of the spirit to phrases or to a catalogue of definitions. We do\r\nknow what the attainments of these ideals should be: The preservation of\r\nself-government and its full foundations in local government; the\r\nperfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields; the\r\nmaintenance of ordered liberty; the denial of domination by any group or\r\nclass; the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity; the\r\nstimulation of initiative and individuality; absolute integrity in\r\npublic affairs; the choice of officials for fitness to office; the\r\ndirection of economic progress toward prosperity for the further\r\nlessening of poverty; the freedom of public opinion; the sustaining of\r\neducation and of the advancement of knowledge; the growth of religious\r\nspirit and the tolerance of all faiths; the strengthening of the home;\r\nthe advancement of peace.\r\n\r\nThere is no short road to the realization of these aspirations. Ours is\r\na progressive people, but with a determination that progress must be\r\nbased upon the foundation of experience. Ill-considered remedies for\r\nour faults bring only penalties after them. But if we hold the faith of\r\nthe men in our mighty past who created these ideals, we shall leave them\r\nheightened and strengthened for our children.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThis is not the time and place for extended discussion. The questions\r\nbefore our country are problems of progress to higher standards; they\r\nare not the problems of degeneration. They demand thought and they serve\r\nto quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for\r\ntheir settlement. And that responsibility rests upon you, my countrymen,\r\nas much as upon those of us who have been selected for office.\r\n\r\nOurs is a land rich in resources; stimulating in its glorious beauty;\r\nfilled with millions of happy homes; blessed with comfort and\r\nopportunity. In no nation are the institutions of progress more\r\nadvanced. In no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure. In\r\nno nation is the government more worthy of respect. No country is more\r\nloved by its people. I have an abiding faith in their capacity,\r\nintegrity and high purpose. I have no fears for the future of our\r\ncountry. It is bright with hope.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of my countrymen, mindful of the solemnity of this\r\noccasion, knowing what the task means and the responsibility which it\r\ninvolves, I beg your tolerance, your aid, and your cooperation. I ask\r\nthe help of Almighty God in this service to my country to which you have\r\ncalled me.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, MARCH 4, 1933\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The former Governor of New York rode to the Capitol\r\nwith President Hoover. Pressures of the economy faced the\r\nPresident-elect as he took his oath of office from Chief Justice Charles\r\nEvans Hughes on the East Portico of the Capitol. He addressed the nation\r\nby radio and announced his plans for a New Deal. Throughout that day the\r\nPresident met with his Cabinet designees at the White House.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am certain that my fellow Americans expect that on my induction into\r\nthe Presidency I will address them with a candor and a decision which\r\nthe present situation of our Nation impels. This is preeminently the\r\ntime to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly. Nor need\r\nwe shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. This\r\ngreat Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will\r\nprosper. So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only\r\nthing we have to fear is fear itself--nameless, unreasoning, unjustified\r\nterror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\r\nIn every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and\r\nvigor has met with that understanding and support of the people\r\nthemselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will\r\nagain give that support to leadership in these critical days.\r\n\r\nIn such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common\r\ndifficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have\r\nshrunken to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has\r\nfallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of\r\nincome; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the\r\nwithered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find\r\nno markets for their produce; the savings of many years in thousands of\r\nfamilies are gone.\r\n\r\nMore important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of\r\nexistence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a\r\nfoolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.\r\n\r\nYet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We are stricken by\r\nno plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our forefathers\r\nconquered because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much\r\nto be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts\r\nhave multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it\r\nlanguishes in the very sight of the supply. Primarily this is because\r\nthe rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through their\r\nown stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their\r\nfailure, and abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers\r\nstand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts\r\nand minds of men.\r\n\r\nTrue they have tried, but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of\r\nan outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit they have proposed only\r\nthe lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which to\r\ninduce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted\r\nto exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They know\r\nonly the rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and\r\nwhen there is no vision the people perish.\r\n\r\nThe money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our\r\ncivilization. We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths. The\r\nmeasure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social\r\nvalues more noble than mere monetary profit.\r\n\r\nHappiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy\r\nof achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy and moral\r\nstimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of\r\nevanescent profits. These dark days will be worth all they cost us if\r\nthey teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to\r\nminister to ourselves and to our fellow men.\r\n\r\nRecognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success\r\ngoes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public\r\noffice and high political position are to be valued only by the\r\nstandards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an\r\nend to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to\r\na sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing. Small\r\nwonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on\r\nhonor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, on\r\nunselfish performance; without them it cannot live.\r\n\r\nRestoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. This Nation\r\nasks for action, and action now.\r\n\r\nOur greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no\r\nunsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be\r\naccomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself,\r\ntreating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the\r\nsame time, through this employment, accomplishing greatly needed\r\nprojects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of\r\npopulation in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national\r\nscale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land\r\nfor those best fitted for the land. The task can be helped by definite\r\nefforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the\r\npower to purchase the output of our cities. It can be helped by\r\npreventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through\r\nforeclosure of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by\r\ninsistence that the Federal, State, and local governments act forthwith\r\non the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped\r\nby the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered,\r\nuneconomical, and unequal. It can be helped by national planning for and\r\nsupervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and\r\nother utilities which have a definitely public character. There are many\r\nways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped merely by\r\ntalking about it. We must act and act quickly.\r\n\r\nFinally, in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two\r\nsafeguards against a return of the evils of the old order; there must be\r\na strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments; there\r\nmust be an end to speculation with other people's money, and there must\r\nbe provision for an adequate but sound currency.\r\n\r\nThere are the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon a new\r\nCongress in special session detailed measures for their fulfillment, and\r\nI shall seek the immediate assistance of the several States.\r\n\r\nThrough this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own\r\nnational house in order and making income balance outgo. Our\r\ninternational trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of\r\ntime and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national\r\neconomy. I favor as a practical policy the putting of first things\r\nfirst. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international\r\neconomic readjustment, but the emergency at home cannot wait on that\r\naccomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery\r\nis not narrowly nationalistic. It is the insistence, as a first\r\nconsideration, upon the interdependence of the various elements in all\r\nparts of the United States--a recognition of the old and permanently\r\nimportant manifestation of the American spirit of the pioneer. It is the\r\nway to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest assurance\r\nthat the recovery will endure.\r\n\r\nIn the field of world policy I would dedicate this Nation to the policy\r\nof the good neighbor--the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and,\r\nbecause he does so, respects the rights of others--the neighbor who\r\nrespects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in\r\nand with a world of neighbors.\r\n\r\nIf I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize as we have\r\nnever realized before our interdependence on each other; that we can not\r\nmerely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we\r\nmust move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good\r\nof a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress is\r\nmade, no leadership becomes effective. We are, I know, ready and willing\r\nto submit our lives and property to such discipline, because it makes\r\npossible a leadership which aims at a larger good. This I propose to\r\noffer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a\r\nsacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of\r\narmed strife.\r\n\r\nWith this pledge taken, I assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this\r\ngreat army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our\r\ncommon problems.\r\n\r\nAction in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of\r\ngovernment which we have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution\r\nis so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet\r\nextraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss\r\nof essential form. That is why our constitutional system has proved\r\nitself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world\r\nhas produced. It has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of\r\nforeign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative\r\nauthority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before\r\nus. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed\r\naction may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of\r\npublic procedure.\r\n\r\nI am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures\r\nthat a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require.\r\nThese measures, or such other measures as the Congress may build out of\r\nits experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my constitutional\r\nauthority, to bring to speedy adoption.\r\n\r\nBut in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of these two\r\ncourses, and in the event that the national emergency is still critical,\r\nI shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I\r\nshall ask the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the\r\ncrisis--broad Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as\r\ngreat as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded\r\nby a foreign foe.\r\n\r\nFor the trust reposed in me I will return the courage and the devotion\r\nthat befit the time. I can do no less.\r\n\r\nWe face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of the\r\nnational unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious\r\nmoral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern\r\nperformance of duty by old and young alike. We aim at the assurance of a\r\nrounded and permanent national life.\r\n\r\nWe do not distrust the future of essential democracy. The people of the\r\nUnited States have not failed. In their need they have registered a\r\nmandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for\r\ndiscipline and direction under leadership. They have made me the present\r\ninstrument of their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.\r\n\r\nIn this dedication of a Nation we humbly ask the blessing of God. May He\r\nprotect each and every one of us. May He guide me in the days to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1937\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  For the first time the inauguration of the President\r\nwas held on January 20, pursuant to the provisions of the 20th amendment\r\nto the Constitution. Having won the election of 1936 by a wide margin,\r\nand looking forward to the advantage of Democratic gains in the House\r\nand Senate, the President confidently outlined the continuation of his\r\nprograms. The oath of office was administered on the East Portico of the\r\nCapitol by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen four years ago we met to inaugurate a President, the Republic,\r\nsingle-minded in anxiety, stood in spirit here. We dedicated ourselves\r\nto the fulfillment of a vision--to speed the time when there would be\r\nfor all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of\r\nhappiness. We of the Republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple\r\nof our ancient faith those who had profaned it; to end by action,\r\ntireless and unafraid, the stagnation and despair of that day. We did\r\nthose first things first.\r\n\r\nOur covenant with ourselves did not stop there. Instinctively we\r\nrecognized a deeper need--the need to find through government the\r\ninstrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the\r\never-rising problems of a complex civilization. Repeated attempts at\r\ntheir solution without the aid of government had left us baffled and\r\nbewildered. For, without that aid, we had been unable to create those\r\nmoral controls over the services of science which are necessary to make\r\nscience a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind. To do\r\nthis we knew that we must find practical controls over blind economic\r\nforces and blindly selfish men.\r\n\r\nWe of the Republic sensed the truth that democratic government has\r\ninnate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered\r\ninevitable, to solve problems once considered unsolvable. We would not\r\nadmit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as,\r\nafter centuries of fatalistic suffering, we had found a way to master\r\nepidemics of disease. We refused to leave the problems of our common\r\nwelfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the hurricanes of\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nIn this we Americans were discovering no wholly new truth; we were\r\nwriting a new chapter in our book of self-government.\r\n\r\nThis year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the\r\nConstitutional Convention which made us a nation. At that Convention our\r\nforefathers found the way out of the chaos which followed the\r\nRevolutionary War; they created a strong government with powers of\r\nunited action sufficient then and now to solve problems utterly beyond\r\nindividual or local solution. A century and a half ago they established\r\nthe Federal Government in order to promote the general welfare and\r\nsecure the blessings of liberty to the American people.\r\n\r\nToday we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same\r\nobjectives.\r\n\r\nFour years of new experience have not belied our historic instinct. They\r\nhold out the clear hope that government within communities, government\r\nwithin the separate States, and government of the United States can do\r\nthe things the times require, without yielding its democracy. Our tasks\r\nin the last four years did not force democracy to take a holiday.\r\n\r\nNearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of human relationships\r\nincrease, so power to govern them also must increase--power to stop\r\nevil; power to do good. The essential democracy of our Nation and the\r\nsafety of our people depend not upon the absence of power, but upon\r\nlodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated\r\nintervals through an honest and free system of elections. The\r\nConstitution of 1787 did not make our democracy impotent.\r\n\r\nIn fact, in these last four years, we have made the exercise of all\r\npower more democratic; for we have begun to bring private autocratic\r\npowers into their proper subordination to the public's government. The\r\nlegend that they were invincible--above and beyond the processes of a\r\ndemocracy--has been shattered. They have been challenged and beaten.\r\n\r\nOur progress out of the depression is obvious. But that is not all that\r\nyou and I mean by the new order of things. Our pledge was not merely to\r\ndo a patchwork job with secondhand materials. By using the new materials\r\nof social justice we have undertaken to erect on the old foundations a\r\nmore enduring structure for the better use of future generations.\r\n\r\nIn that purpose we have been helped by achievements of mind and spirit.\r\nOld truths have been relearned; untruths have been unlearned. We have\r\nalways known that heedless self-interest was bad morals; we know now\r\nthat it is bad economics. Out of the collapse of a prosperity whose\r\nbuilders boasted their practicality has come the conviction that in the\r\nlong run economic morality pays. We are beginning to wipe out the line\r\nthat divides the practical from the ideal; and in so doing we are\r\nfashioning an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a\r\nmorally better world.\r\n\r\nThis new understanding undermines the old admiration of worldly success\r\nas such. We are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power\r\nby those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life.\r\n\r\nIn this process evil things formerly accepted will not be so easily\r\ncondoned. Hard-headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness. We\r\nare moving toward an era of good feeling. But we realize that there can\r\nbe no era of good feeling save among men of good will.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I am justified in believing that the greatest change\r\nwe have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of America.\r\n\r\nAmong men of good will, science and democracy together offer an\r\never-richer life and ever-larger satisfaction to the individual. With\r\nthis change in our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve\r\nour economic order, we have set our feet upon the road of enduring\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nShall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies ahead?\r\nShall we call this the promised land? Or, shall we continue on our way?\r\nFor \"each age is a dream that is dying, or one that is coming to birth.\"\r\n\r\nMany voices are heard as we face a great decision. Comfort says, \"Tarry\r\na while.\" Opportunism says, \"This is a good spot.\" Timidity asks, \"How\r\ndifficult is the road ahead?\"\r\n\r\nTrue, we have come far from the days of stagnation and despair. Vitality\r\nhas been preserved. Courage and confidence have been restored. Mental\r\nand moral horizons have been extended.\r\n\r\nBut our present gains were won under the pressure of more than ordinary\r\ncircumstances. Advance became imperative under the goad of fear and\r\nsuffering. The times were on the side of progress.\r\n\r\nTo hold to progress today, however, is more difficult. Dulled\r\nconscience, irresponsibility, and ruthless self-interest already\r\nreappear. Such symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster!\r\nProsperity already tests the persistence of our progressive purpose.\r\n\r\nLet us ask again: Have we reached the goal of our vision of that fourth\r\nday of March 1933? Have we found our happy valley?\r\n\r\nI see a great nation, upon a great continent, blessed with a great\r\nwealth of natural resources. Its hundred and thirty million people are\r\nat peace among themselves; they are making their country a good neighbor\r\namong the nations. I see a United States which can demonstrate that,\r\nunder democratic methods of government, national wealth can be\r\ntranslated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto unknown,\r\nand the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of\r\nmere subsistence.\r\n\r\nBut here is the challenge to our democracy: In this nation I see tens of\r\nmillions of its citizens--a substantial part of its whole\r\npopulation--who at this very moment are denied the greater part of what\r\nthe very lowest standards of today call the necessities of life.\r\n\r\nI see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the\r\npall of family disaster hangs over them day by day.\r\n\r\nI see millions whose daily lives in city and on farm continue under\r\nconditions labeled indecent by a so-called polite society half a century\r\nago.\r\n\r\nI see millions denied education, recreation, and the opportunity to\r\nbetter their lot and the lot of their children.\r\n\r\nI see millions lacking the means to buy the products of farm and factory\r\nand by their poverty denying work and productiveness to many other\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nI see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.\r\n\r\nIt is not in despair that I paint you that picture. I paint it for you\r\nin hope--because the Nation, seeing and understanding the injustice in\r\nit, proposes to paint it out. We are determined to make every American\r\ncitizen the subject of his country's interest and concern; and we will\r\nnever regard any faithful law-abiding group within our borders as\r\nsuperfluous. The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the\r\nabundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for\r\nthose who have too little.\r\n\r\nIf I know aught of the spirit and purpose of our Nation, we will not\r\nlisten to Comfort, Opportunism, and Timidity. We will carry on.\r\n\r\nOverwhelmingly, we of the Republic are men and women of good will; men\r\nand women who have more than warm hearts of dedication; men and women\r\nwho have cool heads and willing hands of practical purpose as well. They\r\nwill insist that every agency of popular government use effective\r\ninstruments to carry out their will.\r\n\r\nGovernment is competent when all who compose it work as trustees for the\r\nwhole people. It can make constant progress when it keeps abreast of all\r\nthe facts. It can obtain justified support and legitimate criticism when\r\nthe people receive true information of all that government does.\r\n\r\nIf I know aught of the will of our people, they will demand that these\r\nconditions of effective government shall be created and maintained. They\r\nwill demand a nation uncorrupted by cancers of injustice and, therefore,\r\nstrong among the nations in its example of the will to peace.\r\n\r\nToday we reconsecrate our country to long-cherished ideals in a suddenly\r\nchanged civilization. In every land there are always at work forces that\r\ndrive men apart and forces that draw men together. In our personal\r\nambitions we are individualists. But in our seeking for economic and\r\npolitical progress as a nation, we all go up, or else we all go down, as\r\none people.\r\n\r\nTo maintain a democracy of effort requires a vast amount of patience in\r\ndealing with differing methods, a vast amount of humility. But out of\r\nthe confusion of many voices rises an understanding of dominant public\r\nneed. Then political leadership can voice common ideals, and aid in\r\ntheir realization.\r\n\r\nIn taking again the oath of office as President of the United States, I\r\nassume the solemn obligation of leading the American people forward\r\nalong the road over which they have chosen to advance.\r\n\r\nWhile this duty rests upon me I shall do my utmost to speak their\r\npurpose and to do their will, seeking Divine guidance to help us each\r\nand every one to give light to them that sit in darkness and to guide\r\nour feet into the way of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, THIRD INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, JANUARY 20, 1941\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The only chief executive to serve more than two\r\nterms, President Roosevelt took office for the third time as Europe and\r\nAsia engaged in war. The oath of office was administered by Chief\r\nJustice Charles Evans Hughes on the East Portico of the Capitol. The\r\nRoosevelts hosted a reception for several thousand visitors at the White\r\nHouse later that day.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn each national day of inauguration since 1789, the people have renewed\r\ntheir sense of dedication to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn Washington's day the task of the people was to create and weld\r\ntogether a nation.\r\n\r\nIn Lincoln's day the task of the people was to preserve that Nation from\r\ndisruption from within.\r\n\r\nIn this day the task of the people is to save that Nation and its\r\ninstitutions from disruption from without.\r\n\r\nTo us there has come a time, in the midst of swift happenings, to pause\r\nfor a moment and take stock--to recall what our place in history has\r\nbeen, and to rediscover what we are and what we may be. If we do not, we\r\nrisk the real peril of inaction.\r\n\r\nLives of nations are determined not by the count of years, but by the\r\nlifetime of the human spirit. The life of a man is three-score years and\r\nten: a little more, a little less. The life of a nation is the fullness\r\nof the measure of its will to live.\r\n\r\nThere are men who doubt this. There are men who believe that democracy,\r\nas a form of Government and a frame of life, is limited or measured by a\r\nkind of mystical and artificial fate that, for some unexplained reason,\r\ntyranny and slavery have become the surging wave of the future--and that\r\nfreedom is an ebbing tide.\r\n\r\nBut we Americans know that this is not true.\r\n\r\nEight years ago, when the life of this Republic seemed frozen by a\r\nfatalistic terror, we proved that this is not true. We were in the midst\r\nof shock--but we acted. We acted quickly, boldly, decisively.\r\n\r\nThese later years have been living years--fruitful years for the people\r\nof this democracy. For they have brought to us greater security and, I\r\nhope, a better understanding that life's ideals are to be measured in\r\nother than material things. Most vital to our present and our future is\r\nthis experience of a democracy which successfully survived crisis at\r\nhome; put away many evil things; built new structures on enduring lines;\r\nand, through it all, maintained the fact of its democracy.\r\n\r\nFor action has been taken within the three-way framework of the\r\nConstitution of the United States. The coordinate branches of the\r\nGovernment continue freely to function. The Bill of Rights remains\r\ninviolate. The freedom of elections is wholly maintained. Prophets of\r\nthe downfall of American democracy have seen their dire predictions come\r\nto naught.\r\n\r\nDemocracy is not dying.\r\n\r\nWe know it because we have seen it revive--and grow.\r\n\r\nWe know it cannot die--because it is built on the unhampered initiative\r\nof individual men and women joined together in a common enterprise--an\r\nenterprise undertaken and carried through by the free expression of a\r\nfree majority.\r\n\r\nWe know it because democracy alone, of all forms of government, enlists\r\nthe full force of men's enlightened will.\r\n\r\nWe know it because democracy alone has constructed an unlimited\r\ncivilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWe know it because, if we look below the surface, we sense it still\r\nspreading on every continent--for it is the most humane, the most\r\nadvanced, and in the end the most unconquerable of all forms of human\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nA nation, like a person, has a body--a body that must be fed and clothed\r\nand housed, invigorated and rested, in a manner that measures up to the\r\nobjectives of our time.\r\n\r\nA nation, like a person, has a mind--a mind that must be kept informed\r\nand alert, that must know itself, that understands the hopes and the\r\nneeds of its neighbors--all the other nations that live within the\r\nnarrowing circle of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd a nation, like a person, has something deeper, something more\r\npermanent, something larger than the sum of all its parts. It is that\r\nsomething which matters most to its future--which calls forth the most\r\nsacred guarding of its present.\r\n\r\nIt is a thing for which we find it difficult--even impossible--to hit\r\nupon a single, simple word.\r\n\r\nAnd yet we all understand what it is--the spirit--the faith of America.\r\nIt is the product of centuries. It was born in the multitudes of those\r\nwho came from many lands--some of high degree, but mostly plain people,\r\nwho sought here, early and late, to find freedom more freely.\r\n\r\nThe democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history. It\r\nis human history. It permeated the ancient life of early peoples. It\r\nblazed anew in the middle ages. It was written in Magna Charta.\r\n\r\nIn the Americas its impact has been irresistible. America has been the\r\nNew World in all tongues, to all peoples, not because this continent was\r\na new-found land, but because all those who came here believed they\r\ncould create upon this continent a new life--a life that should be new\r\nin freedom.\r\n\r\nIts vitality was written into our own Mayflower Compact, into the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, into the Constitution of the United States,\r\ninto the Gettysburg Address.\r\n\r\nThose who first came here to carry out the longings of their spirit, and\r\nthe millions who followed, and the stock that sprang from them--all have\r\nmoved forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in\r\nitself has gained stature and clarity with each generation.\r\n\r\nThe hopes of the Republic cannot forever tolerate either undeserved\r\npoverty or self-serving wealth.\r\n\r\nWe know that we still have far to go; that we must more greatly build\r\nthe security and the opportunity and the knowledge of every citizen, in\r\nthe measure justified by the resources and the capacity of the land.\r\n\r\nBut it is not enough to achieve these purposes alone. It is not enough\r\nto clothe and feed the body of this Nation, and instruct and inform its\r\nmind. For there is also the spirit. And of the three, the greatest is\r\nthe spirit.\r\n\r\nWithout the body and the mind, as all men know, the Nation could not\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nBut if the spirit of America were killed, even though the Nation's body\r\nand mind, constricted in an alien world, lived on, the America we know\r\nwould have perished.\r\n\r\nThat spirit--that faith--speaks to us in our daily lives in ways often\r\nunnoticed, because they seem so obvious. It speaks to us here in the\r\nCapital of the Nation. It speaks to us through the processes of\r\ngoverning in the sovereignties of 48 States. It speaks to us in our\r\ncounties, in our cities, in our towns, and in our villages. It speaks to\r\nus from the other nations of the hemisphere, and from those across the\r\nseas--the enslaved, as well as the free. Sometimes we fail to hear or\r\nheed these voices of freedom because to us the privilege of our freedom\r\nis such an old, old story.\r\n\r\nThe destiny of America was proclaimed in words of prophecy spoken by our\r\nfirst President in his first inaugural in 1789--words almost directed,\r\nit would seem, to this year of 1941: \"The preservation of the sacred\r\nfire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government\r\nare justly considered... deeply,... finally, staked on the experiment\r\nintrusted to the hands of the American people.\"\r\n\r\nIf we lose that sacred fire--if we let it be smothered with doubt and\r\nfear--then we shall reject the destiny which Washington strove so\r\nvaliantly and so triumphantly to establish. The preservation of the\r\nspirit and faith of the Nation does, and will, furnish the highest\r\njustification for every sacrifice that we may make in the cause of\r\nnational defense.\r\n\r\nIn the face of great perils never before encountered, our strong purpose\r\nis to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy.\r\n\r\nFor this we muster the spirit of America, and the faith of America.\r\n\r\nWe do not retreat. We are not content to stand still. As Americans, we\r\ngo forward, in the service of our country, by the will of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, FOURTH INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, JANUARY 20, 1945\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The fourth inauguration was conducted without\r\nfanfare. Because of the expense and impropriety of festivity during the\r\nheight of war, the oath of office was taken on the South Portico of the\r\nWhite House. It was administered by Chief Justice Harlan Stone. No\r\nformal celebrations followed the address. Instead of renominating Vice\r\nPresident Henry Wallace in the election of 1944, the Democratic\r\nconvention chose the Senator from Missouri, Harry S. Truman.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, my friends, you will understand\r\nand, I believe, agree with my wish that the form of this inauguration be\r\nsimple and its words brief.\r\n\r\nWe Americans of today, together with our allies, are passing through a\r\nperiod of supreme test. It is a test of our courage--of our resolve--of\r\nour wisdom--our essential democracy.\r\n\r\nIf we meet that test--successfully and honorably--we shall perform a\r\nservice of historic importance which men and women and children will\r\nhonor throughout all time.\r\n\r\nAs I stand here today, having taken the solemn oath of office in the\r\npresence of my fellow countrymen--in the presence of our God--I know\r\nthat it is America's purpose that we shall not fail.\r\n\r\nIn the days and in the years that are to come we shall work for a just\r\nand honorable peace, a durable peace, as today we work and fight for\r\ntotal victory in war.\r\n\r\nWe can and we will achieve such a peace.\r\n\r\nWe shall strive for perfection. We shall not achieve it immediately--but\r\nwe still shall strive. We may make mistakes--but they must never be\r\nmistakes which result from faintness of heart or abandonment of moral\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nI remember that my old schoolmaster, Dr. Peabody, said, in days that\r\nseemed to us then to be secure and untroubled: \"Things in life will not\r\nalways run smoothly. Sometimes we will be rising toward the\r\nheights--then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward. The\r\ngreat fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is\r\nforever upward; that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and\r\nthe valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend.\"\r\n\r\nOur Constitution of 1787 was not a perfect instrument; it is not perfect\r\nyet. But it provided a firm base upon which all manner of men, of all\r\nraces and colors and creeds, could build our solid structure of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nAnd so today, in this year of war, 1945, we have learned lessons--at a\r\nfearful cost--and we shall profit by them.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that we cannot live alone, at peace; that our own\r\nwell-being is dependent on the well-being of other nations far away. We\r\nhave learned that we must live as men, not as ostriches, nor as dogs in\r\nthe manger.\r\n\r\nWe have learned to be citizens of the world, members of the human\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nWe have learned the simple truth, as Emerson said, that \"The only way to\r\nhave a friend is to be one.\"\r\n\r\nWe can gain no lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion and\r\nmistrust or with fear. We can gain it only if we proceed with the\r\nunderstanding, the confidence, and the courage which flow from\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nThe Almighty God has blessed our land in many ways. He has given our\r\npeople stout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows\r\nfor freedom and truth. He has given to our country a faith which has\r\nbecome the hope of all peoples in an anguished world.\r\n\r\nSo we pray to Him now for the vision to see our way clearly--to see the\r\nway that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow\r\nmen--to the achievement of His will to peace on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRY S. TRUMAN, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, JANUARY 20, 1949\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  A former county judge, Senator and Vice President,\r\nHarry S. Truman had taken the oath of office first on April 12, 1945,\r\nupon the death of President Roosevelt. Mr. Truman's victory in the 1948\r\nelection was so unexpected that many newspapers had declared the\r\nRepublican candidate, Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York, the winner.\r\nThe President went to the East Portico of the Capitol to take the oath\r\nof office on two Bibles--the personal one he had used for the first\r\noath, and a Gutenberg Bible donated by the citizens of Independence,\r\nMissouri. The ceremony was televised as well as broadcast on the radio.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, and fellow citizens, I accept\r\nwith humility the honor which the American people have conferred upon\r\nme. I accept it with a deep resolve to do all that I can for the welfare\r\nof this Nation and for the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nIn performing the duties of my office, I need the help and prayers of\r\nevery one of you. I ask for your encouragement and your support. The\r\ntasks we face are difficult, and we can accomplish them only if we work\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nEach period of our national history has had its special challenges.\r\nThose that confront us now are as momentous as any in the past. Today\r\nmarks the beginning not only of a new administration, but of a period\r\nthat will be eventful, perhaps decisive, for us and for the world.\r\n\r\nIt may be our lot to experience, and in large measure to bring about, a\r\nmajor turning point in the long history of the human race. The first\r\nhalf of this century has been marked by unprecedented and brutal attacks\r\non the rights of man, and by the two most frightful wars in history. The\r\nsupreme need of our time is for men to learn to live together in peace\r\nand harmony.\r\n\r\nThe peoples of the earth face the future with grave uncertainty,\r\ncomposed almost equally of great hopes and great fears. In this time of\r\ndoubt, they look to the United States as never before for good will,\r\nstrength, and wise leadership.\r\n\r\nIt is fitting, therefore, that we take this occasion to proclaim to the\r\nworld the essential principles of the faith by which we live, and to\r\ndeclare our aims to all peoples.\r\n\r\nThe American people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this\r\nNation from the beginning. We believe that all men have a right to equal\r\njustice under law and equal opportunity to share in the common good. We\r\nbelieve that all men have the right to freedom of thought and\r\nexpression. We believe that all men are created equal because they are\r\ncreated in the image of God.\r\n\r\nFrom this faith we will not be moved.\r\n\r\nThe American people desire, and are determined to work for, a world in\r\nwhich all nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves as they\r\nsee fit, and to achieve a decent and satisfying life. Above all else,\r\nour people desire, and are determined to work for, peace on earth--a\r\njust and lasting peace--based on genuine agreement freely arrived at by\r\nequals.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of these aims, the United States and other like-minded\r\nnations find themselves directly opposed by a regime with contrary aims\r\nand a totally different concept of life.\r\n\r\nThat regime adheres to a false philosophy which purports to offer\r\nfreedom, security, and greater opportunity to mankind. Misled by this\r\nphilosophy, many peoples have sacrificed their liberties only to learn\r\nto their sorrow that deceit and mockery, poverty and tyranny, are their\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nThat false philosophy is communism.\r\n\r\nCommunism is based on the belief that man is so weak and inadequate that\r\nhe is unable to govern himself, and therefore requires the rule of\r\nstrong masters.\r\n\r\nDemocracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and\r\nintellectual capacity, as well as the inalienable right, to govern\r\nhimself with reason and justice.\r\n\r\nCommunism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause,\r\npunishment without trial, and forced labor as the chattel of the state.\r\nIt decrees what information he shall receive, what art he shall produce,\r\nwhat leaders he shall follow, and what thoughts he shall think.\r\n\r\nDemocracy maintains that government is established for the benefit of\r\nthe individual, and is charged with the responsibility of protecting the\r\nrights of the individual and his freedom in the exercise of his\r\nabilities.\r\n\r\nCommunism maintains that social wrongs can be corrected only by\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nDemocracy has proved that social justice can be achieved through\r\npeaceful change.\r\n\r\nCommunism holds that the world is so deeply divided into opposing\r\nclasses that war is inevitable.\r\n\r\nDemocracy holds that free nations can settle differences justly and\r\nmaintain lasting peace.\r\n\r\nThese differences between communism and democracy do not concern the\r\nUnited States alone. People everywhere are coming to realize that what\r\nis involved is material well-being, human dignity, and the right to\r\nbelieve in and worship God.\r\n\r\nI state these differences, not to draw issues of belief as such, but\r\nbecause the actions resulting from the Communist philosophy are a threat\r\nto the efforts of free nations to bring about world recovery and lasting\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nSince the end of hostilities, the United States has invested its\r\nsubstance and its energy in a great constructive effort to restore\r\npeace, stability, and freedom to the world.\r\n\r\nWe have sought no territory and we have imposed our will on none. We\r\nhave asked for no privileges we would not extend to others.\r\n\r\nWe have constantly and vigorously supported the United Nations and\r\nrelated agencies as a means of applying democratic principles to\r\ninternational relations. We have consistently advocated and relied upon\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes among nations.\r\n\r\nWe have made every effort to secure agreement on effective international\r\ncontrol of our most powerful weapon, and we have worked steadily for the\r\nlimitation and control of all armaments.\r\n\r\nWe have encouraged, by precept and example, the expansion of world trade\r\non a sound and fair basis.\r\n\r\nAlmost a year ago, in company with 16 free nations of Europe, we\r\nlaunched the greatest cooperative economic program in history. The\r\npurpose of that unprecedented effort is to invigorate and strengthen\r\ndemocracy in Europe, so that the free people of that continent can\r\nresume their rightful place in the forefront of civilization and can\r\ncontribute once more to the security and welfare of the world.\r\n\r\nOur efforts have brought new hope to all mankind. We have beaten back\r\ndespair and defeatism. We have saved a number of countries from losing\r\ntheir liberty. Hundreds of millions of people all over the world now\r\nagree with us, that we need not have war--that we can have peace.\r\n\r\nThe initiative is ours.\r\n\r\nWe are moving on with other nations to build an even stronger structure\r\nof international order and justice. We shall have as our partners\r\ncountries which, no longer solely concerned with the problem of national\r\nsurvival, are now working to improve the standards of living of all\r\ntheir people. We are ready to undertake new projects to strengthen the\r\nfree world.\r\n\r\nIn the coming years, our program for peace and freedom will emphasize\r\nfour major courses of action.\r\n\r\nFirst, we will continue to give unfaltering support to the United\r\nNations and related agencies, and we will continue to search for ways to\r\nstrengthen their authority and increase their effectiveness. We believe\r\nthat the United Nations will be strengthened by the new nations which\r\nare being formed in lands now advancing toward self-government under\r\ndemocratic principles.\r\n\r\nSecond, we will continue our programs for world economic recovery.\r\n\r\nThis means, first of all, that we must keep our full weight behind the\r\nEuropean recovery program. We are confident of the success of this major\r\nventure in world recovery. We believe that our partners in this effort\r\nwill achieve the status of self-supporting nations once again.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we must carry out our plans for reducing the barriers to\r\nworld trade and increasing its volume. Economic recovery and peace\r\nitself depend on increased world trade.\r\n\r\nThird, we will strengthen freedom-loving nations against the dangers of\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nWe are now working out with a number of countries a joint agreement\r\ndesigned to strengthen the security of the North Atlantic area. Such an\r\nagreement would take the form of a collective defense arrangement within\r\nthe terms of the United Nations Charter.\r\n\r\nWe have already established such a defense pact for the Western\r\nHemisphere by the treaty of Rio de Janeiro.\r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of these agreements is to provide unmistakable proof\r\nof the joint determination of the free countries to resist armed attack\r\nfrom any quarter. Each country participating in these arrangements must\r\ncontribute all it can to the common defense.\r\n\r\nIf we can make it sufficiently clear, in advance, that any armed attack\r\naffecting our national security would be met with overwhelming force,\r\nthe armed attack might never occur.\r\n\r\nI hope soon to send to the Senate a treaty respecting the North Atlantic\r\nsecurity plan.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we will provide military advice and equipment to free\r\nnations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nFourth, we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of\r\nour scientific advances and industrial progress available for the\r\nimprovement and growth of underdeveloped areas.\r\n\r\nMore than half the people of the world are living in conditions\r\napproaching misery. Their food is inadequate. They are victims of\r\ndisease. Their economic life is primitive and stagnant. Their poverty is\r\na handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and the\r\nskill to relieve the suffering of these people.\r\n\r\nThe United States is pre-eminent among nations in the development of\r\nindustrial and scientific techniques. The material resources which we\r\ncan afford to use for the assistance of other peoples are limited. But\r\nour imponderable resources in technical knowledge are constantly growing\r\nand are inexhaustible.\r\n\r\nI believe that we should make available to peace-loving peoples the\r\nbenefits of our store of technical knowledge in order to help them\r\nrealize their aspirations for a better life. And, in cooperation with\r\nother nations, we should foster capital investment in areas needing\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nOur aim should be to help the free peoples of the world, through their\r\nown efforts, to produce more food, more clothing, more materials for\r\nhousing, and more mechanical power to lighten their burdens.\r\n\r\nWe invite other countries to pool their technological resources in this\r\nundertaking. Their contributions will be warmly welcomed. This should be\r\na cooperative enterprise in which all nations work together through the\r\nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies wherever practicable. It\r\nmust be a worldwide effort for the achievement of peace, plenty, and\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nWith the cooperation of business, private capital, agriculture, and\r\nlabor in this country, this program can greatly increase the industrial\r\nactivity in other nations and can raise substantially their standards of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nSuch new economic developments must be devised and controlled to benefit\r\nthe peoples of the areas in which they are established. Guarantees to\r\nthe investor must be balanced by guarantees in the interest of the\r\npeople whose resources and whose labor go into these developments.\r\n\r\nThe old imperialism--exploitation for foreign profit--has no place in\r\nour plans. What we envisage is a program of development based on the\r\nconcepts of democratic fair-dealing.\r\n\r\nAll countries, including our own, will greatly benefit from a\r\nconstructive program for the better use of the world's human and natural\r\nresources. Experience shows that our commerce with other countries\r\nexpands as they progress industrially and economically.\r\n\r\nGreater production is the key to prosperity and peace. And the key to\r\ngreater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modern\r\nscientific and technical knowledge.\r\n\r\nOnly by helping the least fortunate of its members to help themselves\r\ncan the human family achieve the decent, satisfying life that is the\r\nright of all people.\r\n\r\nDemocracy alone can supply the vitalizing force to stir the peoples of\r\nthe world into triumphant action, not only against their human\r\noppressors, but also against their ancient enemies--hunger, misery, and\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these four major courses of action we hope to help\r\ncreate the conditions that will lead eventually to personal freedom and\r\nhappiness for all mankind.\r\n\r\nIf we are to be successful in carrying out these policies, it is clear\r\nthat we must have continued prosperity in this country and we must keep\r\nourselves strong.\r\n\r\nSlowly but surely we are weaving a world fabric of international\r\nsecurity and growing prosperity.\r\n\r\nWe are aided by all who wish to live in freedom from fear--even by those\r\nwho live today in fear under their own governments.\r\n\r\nWe are aided by all who want relief from the lies of propaganda--who\r\ndesire truth and sincerity.\r\n\r\nWe are aided by all who desire self-government and a voice in deciding\r\ntheir own affairs.\r\n\r\nWe are aided by all who long for economic security--for the security and\r\nabundance that men in free societies can enjoy.\r\n\r\nWe are aided by all who desire freedom of speech, freedom of religion,\r\nand freedom to live their own lives for useful ends.\r\n\r\nOur allies are the millions who hunger and thirst after righteousness.\r\n\r\nIn due time, as our stability becomes manifest, as more and more nations\r\ncome to know the benefits of democracy and to participate in growing\r\nabundance, I believe that those countries which now oppose us will\r\nabandon their delusions and join with the free nations of the world in a\r\njust settlement of international differences.\r\n\r\nEvents have brought our American democracy to new influence and new\r\nresponsibilities. They will test our courage, our devotion to duty, and\r\nour concept of liberty.\r\n\r\nBut I say to all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass\r\nin greater liberty.\r\n\r\nSteadfast in our faith in the Almighty, we will advance toward a world\r\nwhere man's freedom is secure.\r\n\r\nTo that end we will devote our strength, our resources, and our firmness\r\nof resolve. With God's help, the future of mankind will be assured in a\r\nworld of justice, harmony, and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1953\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The Republican Party successfully promoted the\r\ncandidacy of the popular General of the Army in the 1952 election over\r\nthe Democratic candidate, Adlai Stevenson. The oath of office was\r\nadministered by Chief Justice Frederick Vinson on two Bibles--the one\r\nused by George Washington at the first inauguration, and the one General\r\nEisenhower received from his mother upon his graduation from the\r\nMilitary Academy at West Point. A large parade followed the ceremony,\r\nand inaugural balls were held at the National Armory and Georgetown\r\nUniversity's McDonough Hall.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy friends, before I begin the expression of those thoughts that I deem\r\nappropriate to this moment, would you permit me the privilege of\r\nuttering a little private prayer of my own. And I ask that you bow your\r\nheads:\r\n\r\nAlmighty God, as we stand here at this moment my future associates in\r\nthe executive branch of government join me in beseeching that Thou will\r\nmake full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in\r\nthis throng, and their fellow citizens everywhere.\r\n\r\nGive us, we pray, the power to discern clearly right from wrong, and\r\nallow all our words and actions to be governed thereby, and by the laws\r\nof this land. Especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the\r\npeople regardless of station, race, or calling.\r\n\r\nMay cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who, under\r\nthe concepts of our Constitution, hold to differing political faiths; so\r\nthat all may work for the good of our beloved country and Thy glory.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nThe world and we have passed the midway point of a century of continuing\r\nchallenge. We sense with all our faculties that forces of good and evil\r\nare massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history.\r\n\r\nThis fact defines the meaning of this day. We are summoned by this\r\nhonored and historic ceremony to witness more than the act of one\r\ncitizen swearing his oath of service, in the presence of God. We are\r\ncalled as a people to give testimony in the sight of the world to our\r\nfaith that the future shall belong to the free.\r\n\r\nSince this century's beginning, a time of tempest has seemed to come\r\nupon the continents of the earth. Masses of Asia have awakened to strike\r\noff shackles of the past. Great nations of Europe have fought their\r\nbloodiest wars. Thrones have toppled and their vast empires have\r\ndisappeared. New nations have been born.\r\n\r\nFor our own country, it has been a time of recurring trial. We have\r\ngrown in power and in responsibility. We have passed through the\r\nanxieties of depression and of war to a summit unmatched in man's\r\nhistory. Seeking to secure peace in the world, we have had to fight\r\nthrough the forests of the Argonne, to the shores of Iwo Jima, and to\r\nthe cold mountains of Korea.\r\n\r\nIn the swift rush of great events, we find ourselves groping to know the\r\nfull sense and meaning of these times in which we live. In our quest of\r\nunderstanding, we beseech God's guidance. We summon all our knowledge of\r\nthe past and we scan all signs of the future. We bring all our wit and\r\nall our will to meet the question:\r\n\r\nHow far have we come in man's long pilgrimage from darkness toward\r\nlight? Are we nearing the light--a day of freedom and of peace for all\r\nmankind? Or are the shadows of another night closing in upon us?\r\n\r\nGreat as are the preoccupations absorbing us at home, concerned as we\r\nare with matters that deeply affect our livelihood today and our vision\r\nof the future, each of these domestic problems is dwarfed by, and often\r\neven created by, this question that involves all humankind.\r\n\r\nThis trial comes at a moment when man's power to achieve good or to\r\ninflict evil surpasses the brightest hopes and the sharpest fears of all\r\nages. We can turn rivers in their courses, level mountains to the\r\nplains. Oceans and land and sky are avenues for our colossal commerce.\r\nDisease diminishes and life lengthens.\r\n\r\nYet the promise of this life is imperiled by the very genius that has\r\nmade it possible. Nations amass wealth. Labor sweats to create--and\r\nturns out devices to level not only mountains but also cities. Science\r\nseems ready to confer upon us, as its final gift, the power to erase\r\nhuman life from this planet.\r\n\r\nAt such a time in history, we who are free must proclaim anew our faith.\r\nThis faith is the abiding creed of our fathers. It is our faith in the\r\ndeathless dignity of man, governed by eternal moral and natural laws.\r\n\r\nThis faith defines our full view of life. It establishes, beyond debate,\r\nthose gifts of the Creator that are man's inalienable rights, and that\r\nmake all men equal in His sight.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this equality, we know that the virtues most cherished\r\nby free people--love of truth, pride of work, devotion to country--all\r\nare treasures equally precious in the lives of the most humble and of\r\nthe most exalted. The men who mine coal and fire furnaces and balance\r\nledgers and turn lathes and pick cotton and heal the sick and plant\r\ncorn--all serve as proudly, and as profitably, for America as the\r\nstatesmen who draft treaties and the legislators who enact laws.\r\n\r\nThis faith rules our whole way of life. It decrees that we, the people,\r\nelect leaders not to rule but to serve. It asserts that we have the\r\nright to choice of our own work and to the reward of our own toil. It\r\ninspires the initiative that makes our productivity the wonder of the\r\nworld. And it warns that any man who seeks to deny equality among all\r\nhis brothers betrays the spirit of the free and invites the mockery of\r\nthe tyrant.\r\n\r\nIt is because we, all of us, hold to these principles that the political\r\nchanges accomplished this day do not imply turbulence, upheaval or\r\ndisorder. Rather this change expresses a purpose of strengthening our\r\ndedication and devotion to the precepts of our founding documents, a\r\nconscious renewal of faith in our country and in the watchfulness of a\r\nDivine Providence.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of this faith know no god but force, no devotion but its\r\nuse. They tutor men in treason. They feed upon the hunger of others.\r\nWhatever defies them, they torture, especially the truth.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is joined no argument between slightly differing\r\nphilosophies. This conflict strikes directly at the faith of our fathers\r\nand the lives of our sons. No principle or treasure that we hold, from\r\nthe spiritual knowledge of our free schools and churches to the creative\r\nmagic of free labor and capital, nothing lies safely beyond the reach of\r\nthis struggle.\r\n\r\nFreedom is pitted against slavery; lightness against the dark.\r\n\r\nThe faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to the free of all the\r\nworld. This common bond binds the grower of rice in Burma and the\r\nplanter of wheat in Iowa, the shepherd in southern Italy and the\r\nmountaineer in the Andes. It confers a common dignity upon the French\r\nsoldier who dies in Indo-China, the British soldier killed in Malaya,\r\nthe American life given in Korea.\r\n\r\nWe know, beyond this, that we are linked to all free peoples not merely\r\nby a noble idea but by a simple need. No free people can for long cling\r\nto any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic solitude. For all our\r\nown material might, even we need markets in the world for the surpluses\r\nof our farms and our factories. Equally, we need for these same farms\r\nand factories vital materials and products of distant lands. This basic\r\nlaw of interdependence, so manifest in the commerce of peace, applies\r\nwith thousand-fold intensity in the event of war.\r\n\r\nSo we are persuaded by necessity and by belief that the strength of all\r\nfree peoples lies in unity; their danger, in discord.\r\n\r\nTo produce this unity, to meet the challenge of our time, destiny has\r\nlaid upon our country the responsibility of the free world's leadership.\r\n\r\nSo it is proper that we assure our friends once again that, in the\r\ndischarge of this responsibility, we Americans know and we observe the\r\ndifference between world leadership and imperialism; between firmness\r\nand truculence; between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic\r\nreaction to the stimulus of emergencies.\r\n\r\nWe wish our friends the world over to know this above all: we face the\r\nthreat--not with dread and confusion--but with confidence and\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nWe feel this moral strength because we know that we are not helpless\r\nprisoners of history. We are free men. We shall remain free, never to be\r\nproven guilty of the one capital offense against freedom, a lack of\r\nstanch faith.\r\n\r\nIn pleading our just cause before the bar of history and in pressing our\r\nlabor for world peace, we shall be guided by certain fixed principles.\r\n\r\nThese principles are:\r\n\r\n(1) Abhorring war as a chosen way to balk the purposes of those who\r\nthreaten us, we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop\r\nthe strength that will deter the forces of aggression and promote the\r\nconditions of peace. For, as it must be the supreme purpose of all free\r\nmen, so it must be the dedication of their leaders, to save humanity\r\nfrom preying upon itself.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this principle, we stand ready to engage with any and\r\nall others in joint effort to remove the causes of mutual fear and\r\ndistrust among nations, so as to make possible drastic reduction of\r\narmaments. The sole requisites for undertaking such effort are that--in\r\ntheir purpose--they be aimed logically and honestly toward secure peace\r\nfor all; and that--in their result--they provide methods by which every\r\nparticipating nation will prove good faith in carrying out its pledge.\r\n\r\n(2) Realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the\r\nfutility of appeasement, we shall never try to placate an aggressor by\r\nthe false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security. Americans,\r\nindeed all free men, remember that in the final choice a soldier's pack\r\nis not so heavy a burden as a prisoner's chains.\r\n\r\n(3) Knowing that only a United States that is strong and immensely\r\nproductive can help defend freedom in our world, we view our Nation's\r\nstrength and security as a trust upon which rests the hope of free men\r\neverywhere. It is the firm duty of each of our free citizens and of\r\nevery free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his country before\r\nthe comfort, the convenience of himself.\r\n\r\n(4) Honoring the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the\r\nworld, we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another\r\npeople our own cherished political and economic institutions.\r\n\r\n(5) Assessing realistically the needs and capacities of proven friends\r\nof freedom, we shall strive to help them to achieve their own security\r\nand well-being. Likewise, we shall count upon them to assume, within the\r\nlimits of their resources, their full and just burdens in the common\r\ndefense of freedom.\r\n\r\n(6) Recognizing economic health as an indispensable basis of military\r\nstrength and the free world's peace, we shall strive to foster\r\neverywhere, and to practice ourselves, policies that encourage\r\nproductivity and profitable trade. For the impoverishment of any single\r\npeople in the world means danger to the well-being of all other peoples.\r\n\r\n(7) Appreciating that economic need, military security and political\r\nwisdom combine to suggest regional groupings of free peoples, we hope,\r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations, to help strengthen such\r\nspecial bonds the world over. The nature of these ties must vary with\r\nthe different problems of different areas.\r\n\r\nIn the Western Hemisphere, we enthusiastically join with all our\r\nneighbors in the work of perfecting a community of fraternal trust and\r\ncommon purpose.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, we ask that enlightened and inspired leaders of the Western\r\nnations strive with renewed vigor to make the unity of their peoples a\r\nreality. Only as free Europe unitedly marshals its strength can it\r\neffectively safeguard, even with our help, its spiritual and cultural\r\nheritage.\r\n\r\n(8) Conceiving the defense of freedom, like freedom itself, to be one\r\nand indivisible, we hold all continents and peoples in equal regard and\r\nhonor. We reject any insinuation that one race or another, one people or\r\nanother, is in any sense inferior or expendable.\r\n\r\n(9) Respecting the United Nations as the living sign of all people's\r\nhope for peace, we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol\r\nbut an effective force. And in our quest for an honorable peace, we\r\nshall neither compromise, nor tire, nor ever cease.\r\n\r\nBy these rules of conduct, we hope to be known to all peoples.\r\n\r\nBy their observance, an earth of peace may become not a vision but a\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nThis hope--this supreme aspiration--must rule the way we live.\r\n\r\nWe must be ready to dare all for our country. For history does not long\r\nentrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid. We must acquire\r\nproficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose.\r\n\r\nWe must be willing, individually and as a Nation, to accept whatever\r\nsacrifices may be required of us. A people that values its privileges\r\nabove its principles soon loses both.\r\n\r\nThese basic precepts are not lofty abstractions, far removed from\r\nmatters of daily living. They are laws of spiritual strength that\r\ngenerate and define our material strength. Patriotism means equipped\r\nforces and a prepared citizenry. Moral stamina means more energy and\r\nmore productivity, on the farm and in the factory. Love of liberty means\r\nthe guarding of every resource that makes freedom possible--from the\r\nsanctity of our families and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\nAnd so each citizen plays an indispensable role. The productivity of our\r\nheads, our hands, and our hearts is the source of all the strength we\r\ncan command, for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nNo person, no home, no community can be beyond the reach of this call.\r\nWe are summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience, to work with\r\nindustry, to teach with persuasion, to preach with conviction, to weigh\r\nour every deed with care and with compassion. For this truth must be\r\nclear before us: whatever America hopes to bring to pass in the world\r\nmust first come to pass in the heart of America.\r\n\r\nThe peace we seek, then, is nothing less than the practice and\r\nfulfillment of our whole faith among ourselves and in our dealings with\r\nothers. This signifies more than the stilling of guns, easing the sorrow\r\nof war. More than escape from death, it is a way of life. More than a\r\nhaven for the weary, it is a hope for the brave.\r\n\r\nThis is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial. This\r\nis the work that awaits us all, to be done with bravery, with charity,\r\nand with prayer to Almighty God.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, JANUARY 21, 1957\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  January 20 occurred on a Sunday, so the President\r\ntook the oath in the East Room at the White House that morning. The next\r\nday he repeated the oath of office on the East Portico of the Capitol.\r\nChief Justice Earl Warren administered the oath of office on the\r\nPresident's personal Bible from West Point. Marian Anderson sang at the\r\nceremony at the Capitol. A large parade and four inaugural balls\r\nfollowed the ceremony.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRICE OF PEACE\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Speaker,\r\nmembers of my family and friends, my countrymen, and the friends of my\r\ncountry, wherever they may be, we meet again, as upon a like moment four\r\nyears ago, and again you have witnessed my solemn oath of service to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI, too, am a witness, today testifying in your name to the principles\r\nand purposes to which we, as a people, are pledged.\r\n\r\nBefore all else, we seek, upon our common labor as a nation, the\r\nblessings of Almighty God. And the hopes in our hearts fashion the\r\ndeepest prayers of our whole people.\r\n\r\nMay we pursue the right--without self-righteousness.\r\n\r\nMay we know unity--without conformity.\r\n\r\nMay we grow in strength--without pride in self.\r\n\r\nMay we, in our dealings with all peoples of the earth, ever speak truth\r\nand serve justice.\r\n\r\nAnd so shall America--in the sight of all men of good will--prove true\r\nto the honorable purposes that bind and rule us as a people in all this\r\ntime of trial through which we pass.\r\n\r\nWe live in a land of plenty, but rarely has this earth known such peril\r\nas today.\r\n\r\nIn our nation work and wealth abound. Our population grows. Commerce\r\ncrowds our rivers and rails, our skies, harbors, and highways. Our soil\r\nis fertile, our agriculture productive. The air rings with the song of\r\nour industry--rolling mills and blast furnaces, dynamos, dams, and\r\nassembly lines--the chorus of America the bountiful.\r\n\r\nThis is our home--yet this is not the whole of our world. For our world\r\nis where our full destiny lies--with men, of all people, and all\r\nnations, who are or would be free. And for them--and so for us--this is\r\nno time of ease or of rest.\r\n\r\nIn too much of the earth there is want, discord, danger. New forces and\r\nnew nations stir and strive across the earth, with power to bring, by\r\ntheir fate, great good or great evil to the free world's future. From\r\nthe deserts of North Africa to the islands of the South Pacific one\r\nthird of all mankind has entered upon an historic struggle for a new\r\nfreedom; freedom from grinding poverty. Across all continents, nearly a\r\nbillion people seek, sometimes almost in desperation, for the skills and\r\nknowledge and assistance by which they may satisfy from their own\r\nresources, the material wants common to all mankind.\r\n\r\nNo nation, however old or great, escapes this tempest of change and\r\nturmoil. Some, impoverished by the recent World War, seek to restore\r\ntheir means of livelihood. In the heart of Europe, Germany still stands\r\ntragically divided. So is the whole continent divided. And so, too, is\r\nall the world.\r\n\r\nThe divisive force is International Communism and the power that it\r\ncontrols.\r\n\r\nThe designs of that power, dark in purpose, are clear in practice. It\r\nstrives to seal forever the fate of those it has enslaved. It strives to\r\nbreak the ties that unite the free. And it strives to capture--to\r\nexploit for its own greater power--all forces of change in the world,\r\nespecially the needs of the hungry and the hopes of the oppressed.\r\n\r\nYet the world of International Communism has itself been shaken by a\r\nfierce and mighty force: the readiness of men who love freedom to pledge\r\ntheir lives to that love. Through the night of their bondage, the\r\nunconquerable will of heroes has struck with the swift, sharp thrust of\r\nlightning. Budapest is no longer merely the name of a city; henceforth\r\nit is a new and shining symbol of man's yearning to be free.\r\n\r\nThus across all the globe there harshly blow the winds of change. And,\r\nwe--though fortunate be our lot--know that we can never turn our backs\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nWe look upon this shaken earth, and we declare our firm and fixed\r\npurpose--the building of a peace with justice in a world where moral law\r\nprevails.\r\n\r\nThe building of such a peace is a bold and solemn purpose. To proclaim\r\nit is easy. To serve it will be hard. And to attain it, we must be aware\r\nof its full meaning--and ready to pay its full price.\r\n\r\nWe know clearly what we seek, and why.\r\n\r\nWe seek peace, knowing that peace is the climate of freedom. And now, as\r\nin no other age, we seek it because we have been warned, by the power of\r\nmodern weapons, that peace may be the only climate possible for human\r\nlife itself.\r\n\r\nYet this peace we seek cannot be born of fear alone: it must be rooted\r\nin the lives of nations. There must be justice, sensed and shared by all\r\npeoples, for, without justice the world can know only a tense and\r\nunstable truce. There must be law, steadily invoked and respected by all\r\nnations, for without law, the world promises only such meager justice as\r\nthe pity of the strong upon the weak. But the law of which we speak,\r\ncomprehending the values of freedom, affirms the equality of all\r\nnations, great and small.\r\n\r\nSplendid as can be the blessings of such a peace, high will be its cost:\r\nin toil patiently sustained, in help honorably given, in sacrifice\r\ncalmly borne.\r\n\r\nWe are called to meet the price of this peace.\r\n\r\nTo counter the threat of those who seek to rule by force, we must pay\r\nthe costs of our own needed military strength, and help to build the\r\nsecurity of others.\r\n\r\nWe must use our skills and knowledge and, at times, our substance, to\r\nhelp others rise from misery, however far the scene of suffering may be\r\nfrom our shores. For wherever in the world a people knows desperate\r\nwant, there must appear at least the spark of hope, the hope of\r\nprogress--or there will surely rise at last the flames of conflict.\r\n\r\nWe recognize and accept our own deep involvement in the destiny of men\r\neverywhere. We are accordingly pledged to honor, and to strive to\r\nfortify, the authority of the United Nations. For in that body rests the\r\nbest hope of our age for the assertion of that law by which all nations\r\nmay live in dignity.\r\n\r\nAnd, beyond this general resolve, we are called to act a responsible\r\nrole in the world's great concerns or conflicts--whether they touch\r\nupon the affairs of a vast region, the fate of an island in the Pacific,\r\nor the use of a canal in the Middle East. Only in respecting the hopes\r\nand cultures of others will we practice the equality of all nations.\r\nOnly as we show willingness and wisdom in giving counsel--in receiving\r\ncounsel--and in sharing burdens, will we wisely perform the work of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nFor one truth must rule all we think and all we do. No people can live\r\nto itself alone. The unity of all who dwell in freedom is their only\r\nsure defense. The economic need of all nations--in mutual\r\ndependence--makes isolation an impossibility; not even America's\r\nprosperity could long survive if other nations did not also prosper. No\r\nnation can longer be a fortress, lone and strong and safe. And any\r\npeople, seeking such shelter for themselves, can now build only their\r\nown prison.\r\n\r\nOur pledge to these principles is constant, because we believe in their\r\nrightness.\r\n\r\nWe do not fear this world of change. America is no stranger to much of\r\nits spirit. Everywhere we see the seeds of the same growth that America\r\nitself has known. The American experiment has, for generations, fired\r\nthe passion and the courage of millions elsewhere seeking freedom,\r\nequality, and opportunity. And the American story of material progress\r\nhas helped excite the longing of all needy peoples for some satisfaction\r\nof their human wants. These hopes that we have helped to inspire, we can\r\nhelp to fulfill.\r\n\r\nIn this confidence, we speak plainly to all peoples.\r\n\r\nWe cherish our friendship with all nations that are or would be free. We\r\nrespect, no less, their independence. And when, in time of want or\r\nperil, they ask our help, they may honorably receive it; for we no more\r\nseek to buy their sovereignty than we would sell our own. Sovereignty is\r\nnever bartered among freemen.\r\n\r\nWe honor the aspirations of those nations which, now captive, long for\r\nfreedom. We seek neither their military alliance nor any artificial\r\nimitation of our society. And they can know the warmth of the welcome\r\nthat awaits them when, as must be, they join again the ranks of freedom.\r\n\r\nWe honor, no less in this divided world than in a less tormented time,\r\nthe people of Russia. We do not dread, rather do we welcome, their\r\nprogress in education and industry. We wish them success in their\r\ndemands for more intellectual freedom, greater security before their own\r\nlaws, fuller enjoyment of the rewards of their own toil. For as such\r\nthings come to pass, the more certain will be the coming of that day\r\nwhen our peoples may freely meet in friendship.\r\n\r\nSo we voice our hope and our belief that we can help to heal this\r\ndivided world. Thus may the nations cease to live in trembling before\r\nthe menace of force. Thus may the weight of fear and the weight of arms\r\nbe taken from the burdened shoulders of mankind.\r\n\r\nThis, nothing less, is the labor to which we are called and our strength\r\ndedicated.\r\n\r\nAnd so the prayer of our people carries far beyond our own frontiers, to\r\nthe wide world of our duty and our destiny.\r\n\r\nMay the light of freedom, coming to all darkened lands, flame\r\nbrightly--until at last the darkness is no more.\r\n\r\nMay the turbulence of our age yield to a true time of peace, when men\r\nand nations shall share a life that honors the dignity of each, the\r\nbrotherhood of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN F. KENNEDY, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1961\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  Heavy snow fell the night before the inauguration,\r\nbut thoughts about cancelling the plans were overruled. The election of\r\n1960 had been close, and the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts was\r\neager to gather support for his agenda. He attended Holy Trinity\r\nCatholic Church in Georgetown that morning before joining President\r\nEisenhower to travel to the Capitol. The Congress had extended the East\r\nFront, and the inaugural platform spanned the new addition. The oath of\r\noffice was administered by Chief Justice Earl Warren. Robert Frost read\r\none of his poems at the ceremony.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President\r\nEisenhower, Vice President Nixon, President Truman, reverend clergy,\r\nfellow citizens, we observe today not a victory of party, but a\r\ncelebration of freedom--symbolizing an end, as well as a\r\nbeginning--signifying renewal, as well as change. For I have sworn\r\nbefore you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears\r\nprescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.\r\n\r\nThe world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the\r\npower to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.\r\nAnd yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought\r\nare still at issue around the globe--the belief that the rights of man\r\ncome not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God.\r\n\r\nWe dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution.\r\nLet the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike,\r\nthat the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in\r\nthis century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace,\r\nproud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the\r\nslow undoing of those human rights to which this Nation has always been\r\ncommitted, and to which we are committed today at home and around the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall\r\npay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend,\r\noppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThis much we pledge--and more.\r\n\r\nTo those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we\r\npledge the loyalty of faithful friends. United, there is little we\r\ncannot do in a host of cooperative ventures. Divided, there is little we\r\ncan do--for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split\r\nasunder.\r\n\r\nTo those new States whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge\r\nour word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away\r\nmerely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny. We shall not always\r\nexpect to find them supporting our view. But we shall always hope to\r\nfind them strongly supporting their own freedom--and to remember that,\r\nin the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the\r\ntiger ended up inside.\r\n\r\nTo those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to\r\nbreak the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them\r\nhelp themselves, for whatever period is required--not because the\r\nCommunists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because\r\nit is right. If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it\r\ncannot save the few who are rich.\r\n\r\nTo our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special\r\npledge--to convert our good words into good deeds--in a new alliance for\r\nprogress--to assist free men and free governments in casting off the\r\nchains of poverty. But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become\r\nthe prey of hostile powers. Let all our neighbors know that we shall\r\njoin with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the\r\nAmericas. And let every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to\r\nremain the master of its own house.\r\n\r\nTo that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last\r\nbest hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the\r\ninstruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support--to prevent it from\r\nbecoming merely a forum for invective--to strengthen its shield of the\r\nnew and the weak--and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.\r\n\r\nFinally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we\r\noffer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest\r\nfor peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science\r\nengulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction.\r\n\r\nWe dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are\r\nsufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will\r\nnever be employed.\r\n\r\nBut neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort\r\nfrom our present course--both sides overburdened by the cost of modern\r\nweapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom,\r\nyet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the\r\nhand of mankind's final war.\r\n\r\nSo let us begin anew--remembering on both sides that civility is not a\r\nsign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof. Let us never\r\nnegotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\r\n\r\nLet both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring\r\nthose problems which divide us.\r\n\r\nLet both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise\r\nproposals for the inspection and control of arms--and bring the absolute\r\npower to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nLet both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its\r\nterrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts,\r\neradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nLet both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of\r\nIsaiah--to \"undo the heavy burdens...and to let the oppressed go\r\nfree.\"\r\n\r\nAnd if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion,\r\nlet both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of\r\npower, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak\r\nsecure and the peace preserved.\r\n\r\nAll this will not be finished in the first 100 days. Nor will it be\r\nfinished in the first 1,000 days, nor in the life of this\r\nAdministration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let\r\nus begin.\r\n\r\nIn your hands, my fellow citizens, more than in mine, will rest the\r\nfinal success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded,\r\neach generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its\r\nnational loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call to\r\nservice surround the globe.\r\n\r\nNow the trumpet summons us again--not as a call to bear arms, though\r\narms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are--but a\r\ncall to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year\r\nout, \"rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation\"--a struggle against the\r\ncommon enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\r\n\r\nCan we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North\r\nand South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all\r\nmankind? Will you join in that historic effort?\r\n\r\nIn the long history of the world, only a few generations have been\r\ngranted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I\r\ndo not shrink from this responsibility--I welcome it. I do not believe\r\nthat any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other\r\ngeneration. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this\r\nendeavor will light our country and all who serve it--and the glow from\r\nthat fire can truly light the world.\r\n\r\nAnd so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for\r\nyou--ask what you can do for your country.\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you,\r\nbut what together we can do for the freedom of man.\r\n\r\nFinally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world,\r\nask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask\r\nof you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the\r\nfinal judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love,\r\nasking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's\r\nwork must truly be our own.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLYNDON BAINES JOHNSON, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1965\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  President Johnson had first taken the oath of office\r\non board Air Force One on November 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy\r\nwas assassinated in Dallas. The election of 1964 was a landslide victory\r\nfor the Democratic Party. Mrs. Johnson joined the President on the\r\nplatform on the East Front of the Capitol; she was the first wife to\r\nstand with her husband as he took the oath of office. The oath was\r\nadministered by Chief Justice Earl Warren. Leontyne Price sang at the\r\nceremony.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fellow countrymen, on this occasion, the oath I have taken before you\r\nand before God is not mine alone, but ours together. We are one nation\r\nand one people. Our fate as a nation and our future as a people rest not\r\nupon one citizen, but upon all citizens.\r\n\r\nThis is the majesty and the meaning of this moment.\r\n\r\nFor every generation, there is a destiny. For some, history decides. For\r\nthis generation, the choice must be our own.\r\n\r\nEven now, a rocket moves toward Mars. It reminds us that the world will\r\nnot be the same for our children, or even for ourselves in a short span\r\nof years. The next man to stand here will look out on a scene different\r\nfrom our own, because ours is a time of change--rapid and fantastic\r\nchange bearing the secrets of nature, multiplying the nations, placing\r\nin uncertain hands new weapons for mastery and destruction, shaking old\r\nvalues, and uprooting old ways.\r\n\r\nOur destiny in the midst of change will rest on the unchanged character\r\nof our people, and on their faith.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN COVENANT\r\n\r\nThey came here--the exile and the stranger, brave but frightened--to\r\nfind a place where a man could be his own man. They made a covenant with\r\nthis land. Conceived in justice, written in liberty, bound in union, it\r\nwas meant one day to inspire the hopes of all mankind; and it binds us\r\nstill. If we keep its terms, we shall flourish.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE AND CHANGE\r\n\r\nFirst, justice was the promise that all who made the journey would share\r\nin the fruits of the land.\r\n\r\nIn a land of great wealth, families must not live in hopeless poverty.\r\nIn a land rich in harvest, children just must not go hungry. In a land\r\nof healing miracles, neighbors must not suffer and die unattended. In a\r\ngreat land of learning and scholars, young people must be taught to read\r\nand write.\r\n\r\nFor the more than 30 years that I have served this Nation, I have\r\nbelieved that this injustice to our people, this waste of our resources,\r\nwas our real enemy. For 30 years or more, with the resources I have had,\r\nI have vigilantly fought against it. I have learned, and I know, that it\r\nwill not surrender easily.\r\n\r\nBut change has given us new weapons. Before this generation of Americans\r\nis finished, this enemy will not only retreat--it will be conquered.\r\n\r\nJustice requires us to remember that when any citizen denies his fellow,\r\nsaying, \"His color is not mine,\" or \"His beliefs are strange and\r\ndifferent,\" in that moment he betrays America, though his forebears\r\ncreated this Nation.\r\n\r\nLIBERTY AND CHANGE\r\n\r\nLiberty was the second article of our covenant. It was self-government.\r\nIt was our Bill of Rights. But it was more. America would be a place\r\nwhere each man could be proud to be himself: stretching his talents,\r\nrejoicing in his work, important in the life of his neighbors and his\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThis has become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem\r\nto tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men. We must work\r\nto provide the knowledge and the surroundings which can enlarge the\r\npossibilities of every citizen.\r\n\r\nThe American covenant called on us to help show the way for the\r\nliberation of man. And that is today our goal. Thus, if as a nation\r\nthere is much outside our control, as a people no stranger is outside\r\nour hope.\r\n\r\nChange has brought new meaning to that old mission. We can never again\r\nstand aside, prideful in isolation. Terrific dangers and troubles that\r\nwe once called \"foreign\" now constantly live among us. If American lives\r\nmust end, and American treasure be spilled, in countries we barely know,\r\nthat is the price that change has demanded of conviction and of our\r\nenduring covenant.\r\n\r\nThink of our world as it looks from the rocket that is heading toward\r\nMars. It is like a child's globe, hanging in space, the continents stuck\r\nto its side like colored maps. We are all fellow passengers on a dot of\r\nearth. And each of us, in the span of time, has really only a moment\r\namong our companions.\r\n\r\nHow incredible it is that in this fragile existence, we should hate and\r\ndestroy one another. There are possibilities enough for all who will\r\nabandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature. There is\r\nworld enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way.\r\n\r\nOur Nation's course is abundantly clear. We aspire to nothing that\r\nbelongs to others. We seek no dominion over our fellow man, but man's\r\ndominion over tyranny and misery.\r\n\r\nBut more is required. Men want to be a part of a common enterprise--a\r\ncause greater than themselves. Each of us must find a way to advance the\r\npurpose of the Nation, thus finding new purpose for ourselves. Without\r\nthis, we shall become a nation of strangers.\r\n\r\nUNION AND CHANGE\r\n\r\nThe third article was union. To those who were small and few against the\r\nwilderness, the success of liberty demanded the strength of union. Two\r\ncenturies of change have made this true again.\r\n\r\nNo longer need capitalist and worker, farmer and clerk, city and\r\ncountryside, struggle to divide our bounty. By working shoulder to\r\nshoulder, together we can increase the bounty of all. We have discovered\r\nthat every child who learns, every man who finds work, every sick body\r\nthat is made whole--like a candle added to an altar--brightens the hope\r\nof all the faithful.\r\n\r\nSo let us reject any among us who seek to reopen old wounds and to\r\nrekindle old hatreds. They stand in the way of a seeking nation.\r\n\r\nLet us now join reason to faith and action to experience, to transform\r\nour unity of interest into a unity of purpose. For the hour and the day\r\nand the time are here to achieve progress without strife, to achieve\r\nchange without hatred--not without difference of opinion, but without\r\nthe deep and abiding divisions which scar the union for generations.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN BELIEF\r\n\r\nUnder this covenant of justice, liberty, and union we have become a\r\nnation--prosperous, great, and mighty. And we have kept our freedom.  But\r\nwe have no promise from God that our greatness will endure.  We have\r\nbeen allowed by Him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and\r\nthe strength of our spirit.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that the Great Society is the ordered, changeless, and\r\nsterile battalion of the ants. It is the excitement of becoming--always\r\nbecoming, trying, probing, falling, resting, and trying again--but\r\nalways trying and always gaining.\r\n\r\nIn each generation, with toil and tears, we have had to earn our\r\nheritage again.\r\n\r\nIf we fail now, we shall have forgotten in abundance what we learned in\r\nhardship: that democracy rests on faith, that freedom asks more than it\r\ngives, and that the judgment of God is harshest on those who are most\r\nfavored.\r\n\r\nIf we succeed, it will not be because of what we have, but it will be\r\nbecause of what we are; not because of what we own, but, rather because\r\nof what we believe.\r\n\r\nFor we are a nation of believers. Underneath the clamor of building and\r\nthe rush of our day's pursuits, we are believers in justice and liberty\r\nand union, and in our own Union. We believe that every man must someday\r\nbe free. And we believe in ourselves.\r\n\r\nOur enemies have always made the same mistake. In my lifetime--in\r\ndepression and in war--they have awaited our defeat. Each time, from the\r\nsecret places of the American heart, came forth the faith they could not\r\nsee or that they could not even imagine. It brought us victory. And it\r\nwill again.\r\n\r\nFor this is what America is all about. It is the uncrossed desert and\r\nthe unclimbed ridge. It is the star that is not reached and the harvest\r\nsleeping in the unplowed ground. Is our world gone? We say \"Farewell.\"\r\nIs a new world coming? We welcome it--and we will bend it to the hopes\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nTo these trusted public servants and to my family and those close\r\nfriends of mine who have followed me down a long, winding road, and to\r\nall the people of this Union and the world, I will repeat today what I\r\nsaid on that sorrowful day in November 1963: \"I will lead and I will do\r\nthe best I can.\"\r\n\r\nBut you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the\r\nold dream. They will lead you best of all.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I ask only, in the words of an ancient leader: \"Give me now\r\nwisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in before this people:\r\nfor who can judge this thy people, that is so great?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD MILHOUS NIXON, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, JANUARY 20, 1969\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  An almost-winner of the 1960 election, and a close\r\nwinner of the 1968 election, the former Vice President and California\r\nSenator and Congressman had defeated the Democratic Vice President,\r\nHubert Humphrey, and the American Independent Party candidate, George\r\nWallace. Chief Justice Earl Warren administered the oath of office for\r\nthe fifth time. The President addressed the large crowd from a pavilion\r\non the East Front of the Capitol. The address was televised by satellite\r\naround the world.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Dirksen, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Vice President, President\r\nJohnson, Vice President Humphrey, my fellow Americans--and my fellow\r\ncitizens of the world community:\r\n\r\nI ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment. In the\r\norderly transfer of power, we celebrate the unity that keeps us free.\r\n\r\nEach moment in history is a fleeting time, precious and unique. But some\r\nstand out as moments of beginning, in which courses are set that shape\r\ndecades or centuries.\r\n\r\nThis can be such a moment.\r\n\r\nForces now are converging that make possible, for the first time, the\r\nhope that many of man's deepest aspirations can at last be realized. The\r\nspiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate, within our own\r\nlifetime, advances that once would have taken centuries.\r\n\r\nIn throwing wide the horizons of space, we have discovered new horizons\r\non earth.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, because the people of the world want peace, and the\r\nleaders of the world are afraid of war, the times are on the side of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nEight years from now America will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a\r\nnation. Within the lifetime of most people now living, mankind will\r\ncelebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand\r\nyears--the beginning of the third millennium.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in,\r\nwhether we shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to\r\ndetermine by our actions and our choices.\r\n\r\nThe greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker. This\r\nhonor now beckons America--the chance to help lead the world at last out\r\nof the valley of turmoil, and onto that high ground of peace that man\r\nhas dreamed of since the dawn of civilization.\r\n\r\nIf we succeed, generations to come will say of us now living that we\r\nmastered our moment, that we helped make the world safe for mankind.\r\n\r\nThis is our summons to greatness.\r\n\r\nI believe the American people are ready to answer this call.\r\n\r\nThe second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement.\r\nWe have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture.\r\nWe have shared our wealth more broadly than ever. We have learned at\r\nlast to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth.\r\n\r\nWe have given freedom new reach, and we have begun to make its promise\r\nreal for black as well as for white.\r\n\r\nWe see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today. I know America's\r\nyouth. I believe in them. We can be proud that they are better educated,\r\nmore committed, more passionately driven by conscience than any\r\ngeneration in our history.\r\n\r\nNo people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and\r\nabundant society, or so possessed of the will to achieve it. Because our\r\nstrengths are so great, we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with\r\ncandor and to approach them with hope.\r\n\r\nStanding in this same place a third of a century ago, Franklin Delano\r\nRoosevelt addressed a Nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear.\r\nHe could say in surveying the Nation's troubles: \"They concern, thank\r\nGod, only material things.\"\r\n\r\nOur crisis today is the reverse.\r\n\r\nWe have found ourselves rich in goods, but ragged in spirit; reaching\r\nwith magnificent precision for the moon, but falling into raucous\r\ndiscord on earth.\r\n\r\nWe are caught in war, wanting peace. We are torn by division, wanting\r\nunity. We see around us empty lives, wanting fulfillment. We see tasks\r\nthat need doing, waiting for hands to do them.\r\n\r\nTo a crisis of the spirit, we need an answer of the spirit.\r\n\r\nTo find that answer, we need only look within ourselves.\r\n\r\nWhen we listen to \"the better angels of our nature,\" we find that they\r\ncelebrate the simple things, the basic things--such as goodness,\r\ndecency, love, kindness.\r\n\r\nGreatness comes in simple trappings.\r\n\r\nThe simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount\r\nwhat divides us, and cement what unites us.\r\n\r\nTo lower our voices would be a simple thing.\r\n\r\nIn these difficult years, America has suffered from a fever of words;\r\nfrom inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver; from\r\nangry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds; from bombastic\r\nrhetoric that postures instead of persuading.\r\n\r\nWe cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one\r\nanother--until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as\r\nwell as our voices.\r\n\r\nFor its part, government will listen. We will strive to listen in new\r\nways--to the voices of quiet anguish, the voices that speak without\r\nwords, the voices of the heart--to the injured voices, the anxious\r\nvoices, the voices that have despaired of being heard.\r\n\r\nThose who have been left out, we will try to bring in.\r\n\r\nThose left behind, we will help to catch up.\r\n\r\nFor all of our people, we will set as our goal the decent order that\r\nmakes progress possible and our lives secure.\r\n\r\nAs we reach toward our hopes, our task is to build on what has gone\r\nbefore--not turning away from the old, but turning toward the new.\r\n\r\nIn this past third of a century, government has passed more laws, spent\r\nmore money, initiated more programs, than in all our previous history.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing our goals of full employment, better housing, excellence in\r\neducation; in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas; in\r\nprotecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life--in all\r\nthese and more, we will and must press urgently forward.\r\n\r\nWe shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from\r\nthe destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home.\r\n\r\nThe American dream does not come to those who fall asleep.\r\n\r\nBut we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do.\r\n\r\nOur greatest need now is to reach beyond government, and to enlist the\r\nlegions of the concerned and the committed.\r\n\r\nWhat has to be done, has to be done by government and people together or\r\nit will not be done at all. The lesson of past agony is that without the\r\npeople we can do nothing; with the people we can do everything.\r\n\r\nTo match the magnitude of our tasks, we need the energies of our\r\npeople--enlisted not only in grand enterprises, but more importantly in\r\nthose small, splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood\r\nnewspaper instead of the national journal.\r\n\r\nWith these, we can build a great cathedral of the spirit--each of us\r\nraising it one stone at a time, as he reaches out to his neighbor,\r\nhelping, caring, doing.\r\n\r\nI do not offer a life of uninspiring ease. I do not call for a life of\r\ngrim sacrifice. I ask you to join in a high adventure--one as rich as\r\nhumanity itself, and as exciting as the times we live in.\r\n\r\nThe essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his\r\nown destiny.\r\n\r\nUntil he has been part of a cause larger than himself, no man is truly\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nThe way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents; we achieve nobility\r\nin the spirit that inspires that use.\r\n\r\nAs we measure what can be done, we shall promise only what we know we\r\ncan produce, but as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams.\r\n\r\nNo man can be fully free while his neighbor is not. To go forward at all\r\nis to go forward together.\r\n\r\nThis means black and white together, as one nation, not two. The laws\r\nhave caught up with our conscience. What remains is to give life to what\r\nis in the law: to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity\r\nbefore God, all are born equal in dignity before man.\r\n\r\nAs we learn to go forward together at home, let us also seek to go\r\nforward together with all mankind.\r\n\r\nLet us take as our goal: where peace is unknown, make it welcome; where\r\npeace is fragile, make it strong; where peace is temporary, make it\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nAfter a period of confrontation, we are entering an era of negotiation.\r\n\r\nLet all nations know that during this administration our lines of\r\ncommunication will be open.\r\n\r\nWe seek an open world--open to ideas, open to the exchange of goods and\r\npeople--a world in which no people, great or small, will live in angry\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\nWe cannot expect to make everyone our friend, but we can try to make no\r\none our enemy.\r\n\r\nThose who would be our adversaries, we invite to a peaceful\r\ncompetition--not in conquering territory or extending dominion, but in\r\nenriching the life of man.\r\n\r\nAs we explore the reaches of space, let us go to the new worlds\r\ntogether--not as new worlds to be conquered, but as a new adventure to\r\nbe shared.\r\n\r\nWith those who are willing to join, let us cooperate to reduce the\r\nburden of arms, to strengthen the structure of peace, to lift up the\r\npoor and the hungry.\r\n\r\nBut to all those who would be tempted by weakness, let us leave no doubt\r\nthat we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be.\r\n\r\nOver the past twenty years, since I first came to this Capital as a\r\nfreshman Congressman, I have visited most of the nations of the world.\r\n\r\nI have come to know the leaders of the world, and the great forces, the\r\nhatreds, the fears that divide the world.\r\n\r\nI know that peace does not come through wishing for it--that there is no\r\nsubstitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy.\r\n\r\nI also know the people of the world.\r\n\r\nI have seen the hunger of a homeless child, the pain of a man wounded in\r\nbattle, the grief of a mother who has lost her son. I know these have no\r\nideology, no race.\r\n\r\nI know America. I know the heart of America is good.\r\n\r\nI speak from my own heart, and the heart of my country, the deep concern\r\nwe have for those who suffer, and those who sorrow.\r\n\r\nI have taken an oath today in the presence of God and my countrymen to\r\nuphold and defend the Constitution of the United States. To that oath I\r\nnow add this sacred commitment: I shall consecrate my office, my\r\nenergies, and all the wisdom I can summon, to the cause of peace among\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nLet this message be heard by strong and weak alike:\r\n\r\nThe peace we seek to win is not victory over any other people, but the\r\npeace that comes \"with healing in its wings\"; with compassion for those\r\nwho have suffered; with understanding for those who have opposed us;\r\nwith the opportunity for all the peoples of this earth to choose their\r\nown destiny.\r\n\r\nOnly a few short weeks ago, we shared the glory of man's first sight of\r\nthe world as God sees it, as a single sphere reflecting light in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nAs the Apollo astronauts flew over the moon's gray surface on Christmas\r\nEve, they spoke to us of the beauty of earth--and in that voice so clear\r\nacross the lunar distance, we heard them invoke God's blessing on its\r\ngoodness.\r\n\r\nIn that moment, their view from the moon moved poet Archibald MacLeish\r\nto write:\r\n\r\n\"To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that\r\neternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the\r\nearth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal\r\ncold--brothers who know now they are truly brothers.\"\r\n\r\nIn that moment of surpassing technological triumph, men turned their\r\nthoughts toward home and humanity--seeing in that far perspective that\r\nman's destiny on earth is not divisible; telling us that however far we\r\nreach into the cosmos, our destiny lies not in the stars but on Earth\r\nitself, in our own hands, in our own hearts.\r\n\r\nWe have endured a long night of the American spirit. But as our eyes\r\ncatch the dimness of the first rays of dawn, let us not curse the\r\nremaining dark. Let us gather the light.\r\n\r\nOur destiny offers, not the cup of despair, but the chalice of\r\nopportunity. So let us seize it, not in fear, but in gladness--and,\r\n\"riders on the earth together,\" let us go forward, firm in our faith,\r\nsteadfast in our purpose, cautious of the dangers; but sustained by our\r\nconfidence in the will of God and the promise of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRICHARD MILHOUS NIXON, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, JANUARY 20, 1973\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The election of 1972 consolidated the gains that the\r\nPresident had made with the electorate in 1968. Although the Democratic\r\nParty maintained majorities in the Congress, the presidential ambitions\r\nof South Dakota Senator George McGovern were unsuccessful. The oath of\r\noffice was administered by Chief Justice Warren Burger on a pavilion\r\nerected on the East Front of the Capitol.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Senator Cook, Mrs.\r\nEisenhower, and my fellow citizens of this great and good country we\r\nshare together:\r\n\r\nWhen we met here four years ago, America was bleak in spirit, depressed\r\nby the prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive\r\nconflict at home.\r\n\r\nAs we meet here today, we stand on the threshold of a new era of peace\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nThe central question before us is: How shall we use that peace? Let us\r\nresolve that this era we are about to enter will not be what other\r\npostwar periods have so often been: a time of retreat and isolation that\r\nleads to stagnation at home and invites new danger abroad.\r\n\r\nLet us resolve that this will be what it can become: a time of great\r\nresponsibilities greatly borne, in which we renew the spirit and the\r\npromise of America as we enter our third century as a nation.\r\n\r\nThis past year saw far-reaching results from our new policies for peace.\r\nBy continuing to revitalize our traditional friendships, and by our\r\nmissions to Peking and to Moscow, we were able to establish the base for\r\na new and more durable pattern of relationships among the nations of the\r\nworld. Because of America's bold initiatives, 1972 will be long\r\nremembered as the year of the greatest progress since the end of World\r\nWar II toward a lasting peace in the world.\r\n\r\nThe peace we seek in the world is not the flimsy peace which is merely\r\nan interlude between wars, but a peace which can endure for generations\r\nto come.\r\n\r\nIt is important that we understand both the necessity and the\r\nlimitations of America's role in maintaining that peace.\r\n\r\nUnless we in America work to preserve the peace, there will be no peace.\r\n\r\nUnless we in America work to preserve freedom, there will be no freedom.\r\n\r\nBut let us clearly understand the new nature of America's role, as a\r\nresult of the new policies we have adopted over these past four years.\r\n\r\nWe shall respect our treaty commitments.\r\n\r\nWe shall support vigorously the principle that no country has the right\r\nto impose its will or rule on another by force.\r\n\r\nWe shall continue, in this era of negotiation, to work for the\r\nlimitation of nuclear arms, and to reduce the danger of confrontation\r\nbetween the great powers.\r\n\r\nWe shall do our share in defending peace and freedom in the world. But\r\nwe shall expect others to do their share.\r\n\r\nThe time has passed when America will make every other nation's conflict\r\nour own, or make every other nation's future our responsibility, or\r\npresume to tell the people of other nations how to manage their own\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nJust as we respect the right of each nation to determine its own future,\r\nwe also recognize the responsibility of each nation to secure its own\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nJust as America's role is indispensable in preserving the world's peace,\r\nso is each nation's role indispensable in preserving its own peace.\r\n\r\nTogether with the rest of the world, let us resolve to move forward from\r\nthe beginnings we have made. Let us continue to bring down the walls of\r\nhostility which have divided the world for too long, and to build in\r\ntheir place bridges of understanding--so that despite profound\r\ndifferences between systems of government, the people of the world can\r\nbe friends.\r\n\r\nLet us build a structure of peace in the world in which the weak are as\r\nsafe as the strong--in which each respects the right of the other to\r\nlive by a different system--in which those who would influence others\r\nwill do so by the strength of their ideas, and not by the force of their\r\narms.\r\n\r\nLet us accept that high responsibility not as a burden, but\r\ngladly--gladly because the chance to build such a peace is the noblest\r\nendeavor in which a nation can engage; gladly, also, because only if we\r\nact greatly in meeting our responsibilities abroad will we remain a\r\ngreat Nation, and only if we remain a great Nation will we act greatly\r\nin meeting our challenges at home.\r\n\r\nWe have the chance today to do more than ever before in our history to\r\nmake life better in America--to ensure better education, better health,\r\nbetter housing, better transportation, a cleaner environment--to restore\r\nrespect for law, to make our communities more livable--and to insure the\r\nGod-given right of every American to full and equal opportunity.\r\n\r\nBecause the range of our needs is so great--because the reach of our\r\nopportunities is so great--let us be bold in our determination to meet\r\nthose needs in new ways.\r\n\r\nJust as building a structure of peace abroad has required turning away\r\nfrom old policies that failed, so building a new era of progress at home\r\nrequires turning away from old policies that have failed.\r\n\r\nAbroad, the shift from old policies to new has not been a retreat from\r\nour responsibilities, but a better way to peace.\r\n\r\nAnd at home, the shift from old policies to new will not be a retreat\r\nfrom our responsibilities, but a better way to progress.\r\n\r\nAbroad and at home, the key to those new responsibilities lies in the\r\nplacing and the division of responsibility. We have lived too long with\r\nthe consequences of attempting to gather all power and responsibility in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nAbroad and at home, the time has come to turn away from the\r\ncondescending policies of paternalism--of \"Washington knows best.\"\r\n\r\nA person can be expected to act responsibly only if he has\r\nresponsibility. This is human nature. So let us encourage individuals at\r\nhome and nations abroad to do more for themselves, to decide more for\r\nthemselves. Let us locate responsibility in more places. Let us measure\r\nwhat we will do for others by what they will do for themselves.\r\n\r\nThat is why today I offer no promise of a purely governmental solution\r\nfor every problem. We have lived too long with that false promise. In\r\ntrusting too much in government, we have asked of it more than it can\r\ndeliver. This leads only to inflated expectations, to reduced individual\r\neffort, and to a disappointment and frustration that erode confidence\r\nboth in what government can do and in what people can do.\r\n\r\nGovernment must learn to take less from people so that people can do\r\nmore for themselves.\r\n\r\nLet us remember that America was built not by government, but by\r\npeople--not by welfare, but by work--not by shirking responsibility, but\r\nby seeking responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn our own lives, let each of us ask--not just what will government do\r\nfor me, but what can I do for myself?\r\n\r\nIn the challenges we face together, let each of us ask--not just how can\r\ngovernment help, but how can I help?\r\n\r\nYour National Government has a great and vital role to play. And I\r\npledge to you that where this Government should act, we will act boldly\r\nand we will lead boldly. But just as important is the role that each and\r\nevery one of us must play, as an individual and as a member of his own\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nFrom this day forward, let each of us make a solemn commitment in his\r\nown heart: to bear his responsibility, to do his part, to live his\r\nideals--so that together, we can see the dawn of a new age of progress\r\nfor America, and together, as we celebrate our 200th anniversary as a\r\nnation, we can do so proud in the fulfillment of our promise to\r\nourselves and to the world.\r\n\r\nAs America's longest and most difficult war comes to an end, let us\r\nagain learn to debate our differences with civility and decency. And let\r\neach of us reach out for that one precious quality government cannot\r\nprovide--a new level of respect for the rights and feelings of one\r\nanother, a new level of respect for the individual human dignity which\r\nis the cherished birthright of every American.\r\n\r\nAbove all else, the time has come for us to renew our faith in ourselves\r\nand in America.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, that faith has been challenged.\r\n\r\nOur children have been taught to be ashamed of their country, ashamed of\r\ntheir parents, ashamed of America's record at home and of its role in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nAt every turn, we have been beset by those who find everything wrong\r\nwith America and little that is right. But I am confident that this will\r\nnot be the judgment of history on these remarkable times in which we are\r\nprivileged to live.\r\n\r\nAmerica's record in this century has been unparalleled in the world's\r\nhistory for its responsibility, for its generosity, for its creativity\r\nand for its progress.\r\n\r\nLet us be proud that our system has produced and provided more freedom\r\nand more abundance, more widely shared, than any other system in the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\nLet us be proud that in each of the four wars in which we have been\r\nengaged in this century, including the one we are now bringing to an\r\nend, we have fought not for our selfish advantage, but to help others\r\nresist aggression.\r\n\r\nLet us be proud that by our bold, new initiatives, and by our\r\nsteadfastness for peace with honor, we have made a break-through toward\r\ncreating in the world what the world has not known before--a structure\r\nof peace that can last, not merely for our time, but for generations to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nWe are embarking here today on an era that presents challenges great as\r\nthose any nation, or any generation, has ever faced.\r\n\r\nWe shall answer to God, to history, and to our conscience for the way in\r\nwhich we use these years.\r\n\r\nAs I stand in this place, so hallowed by history, I think of others who\r\nhave stood here before me. I think of the dreams they had for America,\r\nand I think of how each recognized that he needed help far beyond\r\nhimself in order to make those dreams come true.\r\n\r\nToday, I ask your prayers that in the years ahead I may have God's help\r\nin making decisions that are right for America, and I pray for your help\r\nso that together we may be worthy of our challenge.\r\n\r\nLet us pledge together to make these next four years the best four years\r\nin America's history, so that on its 200th birthday America will be as\r\nyoung and as vital as when it began, and as bright a beacon of hope for\r\nall the world.\r\n\r\nLet us go forward from here confident in hope, strong in our faith in\r\none another, sustained by our faith in God who created us, and striving\r\nalways to serve His purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJIMMY CARTER, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, JANUARY 20, 1977\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The Democrats reclaimed the White House in the 1976\r\nelection. The Governor from Georgia defeated Gerald Ford, who had become\r\nPresident on August 9, 1974, upon the resignation of President Nixon.\r\nThe oath of office was taken on the Bible used in the first inauguration\r\nby George | Washington; it was administered by Chief Justice Warren\r\nBurger on the East Front of the Capitol. The new President and his\r\nfamily surprised the spectators by walking from the Capitol to the White\r\nHouse after the ceremony.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor myself and for our Nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he\r\nhas done to heal our land.\r\n\r\nIn this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner\r\nand spiritual strength of our Nation. As my high school teacher, Miss\r\nJulia Coleman, used to say: \"We must adjust to changing times and still\r\nhold to unchanging principles.\"\r\n\r\nHere before me is the Bible used in the inauguration of our first\r\nPresident, in 1789, and I have just taken the oath of office on the\r\nBible my mother gave me a few years ago, opened to a timeless admonition\r\nfrom the ancient prophet Micah:\r\n\r\n\"He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord\r\nrequire of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly\r\nwith thy God.\" (Micah 6: 8)\r\n\r\nThis inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning, a new dedication\r\nwithin our Government, and a new spirit among us all. A President may\r\nsense and proclaim that new spirit, but only a people can provide it.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries ago our Nation's birth was a milestone in the long quest\r\nfor freedom, but the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders\r\nof this Nation still awaits its consummation. I have no new dream to set\r\nforth today, but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream.\r\n\r\nOurs was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both\r\nspirituality and of human liberty. It is that unique self-definition\r\nwhich has given us an exceptional appeal, but it also imposes on us a\r\nspecial obligation, to take on those moral duties which, when assumed,\r\nseem invariably to be in our own best interests.\r\n\r\nYou have given me a great responsibility--to stay close to you, to be\r\nworthy of you, and to exemplify what you are. Let us create together a\r\nnew national spirit of unity and trust. Your strength can compensate for\r\nmy weakness, and your wisdom can help to minimize my mistakes.\r\n\r\nLet us learn together and laugh together and work together and pray\r\ntogether, confident that in the end we will triumph together in the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nThe American dream endures. We must once again have full faith in our\r\ncountry--and in one another. I believe America can be better. We can be\r\neven stronger than before.\r\n\r\nLet our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic\r\nprinciples of our Nation, for we know that if we despise our own\r\ngovernment we have no future. We recall in special times when we have\r\nstood briefly, but magnificently, united. In those times no prize was\r\nbeyond our grasp.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot dwell upon remembered glory. We cannot afford to drift. We\r\nreject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of\r\nlife for any person. Our Government must at the same time be both\r\ncompetent and compassionate.\r\n\r\nWe have already found a high degree of personal liberty, and we are now\r\nstruggling to enhance equality of opportunity. Our commitment to human\r\nrights must be absolute, our laws fair, our natural beauty preserved;\r\nthe powerful must not persecute the weak, and human dignity must be\r\nenhanced.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that \"more\" is not necessarily \"better,\" that even our\r\ngreat Nation has its recognized limits, and that we can neither answer\r\nall questions nor solve all problems. We cannot afford to do everything,\r\nnor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future. So, together,\r\nin a spirit of individual sacrifice for the common good, we must simply\r\ndo our best.\r\n\r\nOur Nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home. And we\r\nknow that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to\r\ndemonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation.\r\n\r\nTo be true to ourselves, we must be true to others. We will not behave\r\nin foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home,\r\nfor we know that the trust which our Nation earns is essential to our\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThe world itself is now dominated by a new spirit. Peoples more numerous\r\nand more politically aware are craving and now demanding their place in\r\nthe sun--not just for the benefit of their own physical condition, but\r\nfor basic human rights.\r\n\r\nThe passion for freedom is on the rise. Tapping this new spirit, there\r\ncan be no nobler nor more ambitious task for America to undertake on\r\nthis day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world\r\nthat is truly humane.\r\n\r\nWe are a strong nation, and we will maintain strength so sufficient that\r\nit need not be proven in combat--a quiet strength based not merely on\r\nthe size of an arsenal, but on the nobility of ideas.\r\n\r\nWe will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable, and we will fight our\r\nwars against poverty, ignorance, and injustice--for those are the\r\nenemies against which our forces can be honorably marshaled.\r\n\r\nWe are a purely idealistic Nation, but let no one confuse our idealism\r\nwith weakness.\r\n\r\nBecause we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom\r\nelsewhere. Our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these\r\nsocieties which share with us an abiding respect for individual human\r\nrights. We do not seek to intimidate, but it is clear that a world which\r\nothers can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a\r\nthreat to the well-being of all people.\r\n\r\nThe world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to\r\nensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries. We\r\npledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world's\r\narmaments to those necessary for each nation's own domestic safety. And\r\nwe will move this year a step toward ultimate goal--the elimination of\r\nall nuclear weapons from this Earth. We urge all other people to join\r\nus, for success can mean life instead of death.\r\n\r\nWithin us, the people of the United States, there is evident a serious\r\nand purposeful rekindling of confidence. And I join in the hope that\r\nwhen my time as your President has ended, people might say this about\r\nour Nation:\r\n\r\n--that we had remembered the words of Micah and renewed our search for\r\nhumility, mercy, and justice;\r\n\r\n--that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different\r\nrace and region and religion, and where there had been mistrust, built\r\nunity, with a respect for diversity;\r\n\r\n--that we had found productive work for those able to perform it;\r\n\r\n--that we had strengthened the American family, which is the basis of\r\nour society;\r\n\r\n--that we had ensured respect for the law, and equal treatment under the\r\nlaw, for the weak and the powerful, for the rich and the poor;\r\n\r\n--and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own Government\r\nonce again.\r\n\r\nI would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a\r\nlasting peace, built not on weapons of war but on international policies\r\nwhich reflect our own most precious values.\r\n\r\nThese are not just my goals, and they will not be my accomplishments,\r\nbut the affirmation of our Nation's continuing moral strength and our\r\nbelief in an undiminished, ever-expanding American dream.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRONALD REAGAN, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, JANUARY 20, 1981\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  For the first time, an inauguration ceremony was\r\nheld on the terrace of the West Front of the Capitol. Chief Justice\r\nWarren Burger administered the oath of office to the former broadcaster,\r\nscreen actor, and Governor of California. In the election of 1980, the\r\nRepublicans won the White House and a majority in the Senate. On\r\ninauguration day, American hostages held by the revolutionary government\r\nof Iran were released.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Bush,\r\nVice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill, Reverend Moomaw,\r\nand my fellow citizens: To a few of us here today, this is a solemn and\r\nmost momentous occasion; and yet, in the history of our Nation, it is a\r\ncommonplace occurrence. The orderly transfer of authority as called for\r\nin the Constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two\r\ncenturies and few of us stop to think how unique we really are. In the\r\neyes of many in the world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as\r\nnormal is nothing less than a miracle.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to\r\ncarry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in the transition\r\nprocess, you have shown a watching world that we are a united people\r\npledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual\r\nliberty to a greater degree than any other, and I thank you and your\r\npeople for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the\r\nbulwark of our Republic.\r\n\r\nThe business of our nation goes forward. These United States are\r\nconfronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We suffer\r\nfrom the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our\r\nnational history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift,\r\nand crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike. It\r\nthreatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people.\r\n\r\nIdle industries have cast workers into unemployment, causing human\r\nmisery and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a fair\r\nreturn for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful\r\nachievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.\r\n\r\nBut great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public\r\nspending. For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging\r\nour future and our children's future for the temporary convenience of\r\nthe present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous\r\nsocial, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.\r\n\r\nYou and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but\r\nfor only a limited period of time. Why, then, should we think that\r\ncollectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?\r\n\r\nWe must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there be no\r\nmisunderstanding--we are going to begin to act, beginning today.\r\n\r\nThe economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades. They\r\nwill not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away. They\r\nwill go away because we, as Americans, have the capacity now, as we have\r\nhad in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last\r\nand greatest bastion of freedom.\r\n\r\nIn this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society has\r\nbecome too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an\r\nelite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people. But if\r\nno one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has\r\nthe capacity to govern someone else? All of us together, in and out of\r\ngovernment, must bear the burden. The solutions we seek must be\r\nequitable, with no one group singled out to pay a higher price.\r\n\r\nWe hear much of special interest groups. Our concern must be for a\r\nspecial interest group that has been too long neglected. It knows no\r\nsectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses\r\npolitical party lines. It is made up of men and women who raise our\r\nfood, patrol our streets, man our mines and our factories, teach our\r\nchildren, keep our homes, and heal us when we are sick--professionals,\r\nindustrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers. They\r\nare, in short, \"We the people,\" this breed called Americans.\r\n\r\nWell, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous,\r\ngrowing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans, with\r\nno barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America back to\r\nwork means putting all Americans back to work. Ending inflation means\r\nfreeing all Americans from the terror of runaway living costs. All must\r\nshare in the productive work of this \"new beginning\" and all must share\r\nin the bounty of a revived economy. With the idealism and fair play\r\nwhich are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong\r\nand prosperous America at peace with itself and the world.\r\n\r\nSo, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has a\r\ngovernment--not the other way around. And this makes us special among\r\nthe nations of the Earth. Our Government has no power except that\r\ngranted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse the growth of\r\ngovernment which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the\r\ngoverned.\r\n\r\nIt is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal\r\nestablishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the\r\npowers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the\r\nStates or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal\r\nGovernment did not create the States; the States created the Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nNow, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my intention to do\r\naway with government. It is, rather, to make it work-work with us, not\r\nover us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and\r\nmust provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not\r\nstifle it.\r\n\r\nIf we look to the answer as to why, for so many years, we achieved so\r\nmuch, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because here, in\r\nthis land, we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a\r\ngreater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom and the dignity\r\nof the individual have been more available and assured here than in any\r\nother place on Earth. The price for this freedom at times has been high,\r\nbut we have never been unwilling to pay that price.\r\n\r\nIt is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are\r\nproportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result\r\nfrom unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It is time for us\r\nto realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small\r\ndreams. We are not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an\r\ninevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no\r\nmatter what we do. I do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do\r\nnothing. So, with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin\r\nan era of national renewal. Let us renew our determination, our courage,\r\nand our strength. And let us renew our faith and our hope.\r\n\r\nWe have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that we are in\r\na time when there are no heroes just don't know where to look. You can\r\nsee heroes every day going in and out of factory gates. Others, a\r\nhandful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the\r\nworld beyond. You meet heroes across a counter--and they are on both\r\nsides of that counter. There are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves\r\nand faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity.\r\nThey are individuals and families whose taxes support the Government and\r\nwhose voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and\r\neducation. Their patriotism is quiet but deep. Their values sustain our\r\nnational life.\r\n\r\nI have used the words \"they\" and \"their\" in speaking of these heroes. I\r\ncould say \"you\" and \"your\" because I am addressing the heroes of whom I\r\nspeak--you, the citizens of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes,\r\nyour goals are going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this\r\nadministration, so help me God.\r\n\r\nWe shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup.\r\nHow can we love our country and not love our countrymen, and loving\r\nthem, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when they are sick, and\r\nprovide opportunities to make them self-sufficient so they will be\r\nequal in fact and not just in theory?\r\n\r\nCan we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is an\r\nunequivocal and emphatic \"yes.\" To paraphrase Winston Churchill, I did\r\nnot take the oath I have just taken with the intention of presiding over\r\nthe dissolution of the world's strongest economy.\r\n\r\nIn the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that have\r\nslowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be taken aimed\r\nat restoring the balance between the various levels of government.\r\nProgress may be slow--measured in inches and feet, not miles--but we\r\nwill progress. Is it time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get\r\ngovernment back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax\r\nburden. And these will be our first priorities, and on these principles,\r\nthere will be no compromise.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been\r\none of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph Warren,\r\nPresident of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow Americans,\r\n\"Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of.... On you depend\r\nthe fortunes of America. You are to decide the important questions upon\r\nwhich rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn. Act\r\nworthy of yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nWell, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy of\r\nourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty\r\nfor ourselves, our children and our children's children.\r\n\r\nAnd as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as\r\nhaving greater strength throughout the world. We will again be the\r\nexemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nTo those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen\r\nour historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment. We\r\nwill match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually beneficial\r\nrelations. We will not use our friendship to impose on their\r\nsovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.\r\n\r\nAs for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries, they\r\nwill be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the American\r\npeople. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it; we will not\r\nsurrender for it--now or ever.\r\n\r\nOur forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance for\r\nconflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. When action is\r\nrequired to preserve our national security, we will act. We will\r\nmaintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be, knowing that if we\r\ndo so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength.\r\n\r\nAbove all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the arsenals\r\nof the world, is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men\r\nand women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.\r\nIt is a weapon that we as Americans do have. Let that be understood by\r\nthose who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors.\r\n\r\nI am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on\r\nthis day, and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a nation under God,\r\nand I believe God intended for us to be free. It would be fitting and\r\ngood, I think, if on each Inauguration Day in future years it should be\r\ndeclared a day of prayer.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time in history that this ceremony has been held, as\r\nyou have been told, on this West Front of the Capitol. Standing here,\r\none faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this city's special beauty\r\nand history. At the end of this open mall are those shrines to the\r\ngiants on whose shoulders we stand.\r\n\r\nDirectly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man: George\r\nWashington, Father of our country. A man of humility who came to\r\ngreatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary victory into\r\ninfant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial to Thomas\r\nJefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with his eloquence.\r\n\r\nAnd then beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified columns of the Lincoln\r\nMemorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of America\r\nwill find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\nBeyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on the far\r\nshore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery with its row on\r\nrow of simple white markers bearing crosses or Stars of David. They add\r\nup to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nEach one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero I spoke of\r\nearlier. Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood, The Argonne,\r\nOmaha Beach, Salerno and halfway around the world on Guadalcanal,\r\nTarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir, and in a hundred rice\r\npaddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.\r\n\r\nUnder one such marker lies a young man--Martin Treptow--who left his job\r\nin a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with the famed\r\nRainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was killed trying to\r\ncarry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire.\r\n\r\nWe are told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf under the\r\nheading, \"My Pledge,\" he had written these words: \"America must win this\r\nwar. Therefore, I will work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will\r\nendure, I will fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the\r\nwhole struggle depended on me alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of\r\nsacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others were\r\ncalled upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort, and our\r\nwillingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to\r\nperform great deeds; to believe that together, with God's help, we can\r\nand will resolve the problems which now confront us.\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are Americans. God\r\nbless you, and thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRONALD REAGAN, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nMONDAY, JANUARY 21, 1985\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  January 20 was a Sunday, and the President took the\r\noath of office, administered by Chief Justice Warren Burger, in the\r\nGrand Foyer of the White House. Weather that hovered near zero that\r\nnight and on Monday forced the planners to cancel many of the outdoor\r\nevents for the second inauguration. For the first time a President took\r\nthe oath of office in the Capitol Rotunda. The oath was again\r\nadministered by Chief Justice Burger. Jessye Norman sang at the\r\nceremony.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker\r\nO'Neill, Senator Dole, Reverend Clergy, members of my family and\r\nfriends, and my fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nThis day has been made brighter with the presence here of one who, for a\r\ntime, has been absent--Senator John Stennis.\r\n\r\nGod bless you and welcome back.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one who is not with us today: Representative Gillis\r\nLong of Louisiana left us last night. I wonder if we could all join in a\r\nmoment of silent prayer. (Moment of silent prayer.) Amen.\r\n\r\nThere are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor\r\nthat you have bestowed on me. I will do my utmost to be deserving of\r\nyour trust.\r\n\r\nThis is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we the people\r\nhave celebrated this historic occasion. When the first President, George\r\nWashington, placed his hand upon the Bible, he stood less than a single\r\nday's journey by horseback from raw, untamed wilderness. There were 4\r\nmillion Americans in a union of 13 States. Today we are 60 times as many\r\nin a union of 50 States. We have lighted the world with our inventions,\r\ngone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for\r\nhelp, journeyed to the Moon and safely returned. So much has changed.\r\nAnd yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago.\r\n\r\nWhen I took this oath four years ago, I did so in a time of economic\r\nstress. Voices were raised saying we had to look to our past for the\r\ngreatness and glory. But we, the present-day Americans, are not given to\r\nlooking backward. In this blessed land, there is always a better\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, I spoke to you of a new beginning and we have\r\naccomplished that. But in another sense, our new beginning is a\r\ncontinuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when, for the\r\nfirst time in history, government, the people said, was not our master,\r\nit is our servant; its only power that which we the people allow it to\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nThat system has never failed us, but, for a time, we failed the system.\r\nWe asked things of government that government was not equipped to give.\r\nWe yielded authority to the National Government that properly belonged\r\nto States or to local governments or to the people themselves. We\r\nallowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and\r\nwatched the great industrial machine that had made us the most\r\nproductive people on Earth slow down and the number of unemployed\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nBy 1980, we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with all our\r\nstrength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an\r\norderly society.\r\n\r\nWe believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human\r\nprogress when men and women are free to follow their dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd we were right to believe that. Tax rates have been reduced,\r\ninflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than ever\r\nbefore in our history.\r\n\r\nWe are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive. But\r\nthere are many mountains yet to climb. We will not rest until every\r\nAmerican enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity as our\r\nbirthright. It is our birthright as citizens of this great Republic, and\r\nwe'll meet this challenge.\r\n\r\nThese will be years when Americans have restored their confidence and\r\ntradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work, and\r\nneighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy was\r\nfinally freed from government's grip; when we made sincere efforts at\r\nmeaningful arms reduction, rebuilding our defenses, our economy, and\r\ndeveloping new technologies, and helped preserve peace in a troubled\r\nworld; when Americans courageously supported the struggle for liberty,\r\nself-government, and free enterprise throughout the world, and turned\r\nthe tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm\r\nsunlight of human freedom.\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens, our Nation is poised for greatness. We must do what\r\nwe know is right and do it with all our might. Let history say of us,\r\n\"These were golden years--when the American Revolution was reborn, when\r\nfreedom gained new life, when America reached for her best.\"\r\n\r\nOur two-party system has served us well over the years, but never better\r\nthan in those times of great challenge when we came together not as\r\nDemocrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a common cause.\r\n\r\nTwo of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a Virginia\r\nplanter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group who met in\r\nIndependence Hall and dared to think they could start the world over\r\nagain, left us an important lesson. They had become political rivals in\r\nthe Presidential election of 1800. Then years later, when both were\r\nretired, and age had softened their anger, they began to speak to each\r\nother again through letters. A bond was reestablished between those two\r\nwho had helped create this government of ours.\r\n\r\nIn 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, they\r\nboth died. They died on the same day, within a few hours of each other,\r\nand that day was the Fourth of July.\r\n\r\nIn one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives,\r\nJefferson wrote: \"It carries me back to the times when, beset with\r\ndifficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the same cause,\r\nstruggling for what is most valuable to man, his right to\r\nself-government. Laboring always at the same oar, with some wave ever\r\nahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless...we rode\r\nthrough the storm with heart and hand.\"\r\n\r\nWell, with heart and hand, let us stand as one today: One people under\r\nGod determined that our future shall be worthy of our past. As we do, we\r\nmust not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our past. We must never\r\nagain abuse the trust of working men and women, by sending their\r\nearnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated\r\nFederal Establishment. You elected us in 1980 to end this prescription\r\nfor disaster, and I don't believe you reelected us in 1984 to reverse\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight months\r\nof economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the drive and\r\nentrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress. We have\r\nbegun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment; reduce\r\nthe increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in\r\npeople's lives.\r\n\r\nWe must simplify our tax system, make it more fair, and bring the rates\r\ndown for all who work and earn. We must think anew and move with a new\r\nboldness, so every American who seeks work can find work; so the least\r\namong us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things--to\r\nbe heroes who heal our sick, feed the hungry, protect peace among\r\nnations, and leave this world a better place.\r\n\r\nThe time has come for a new American emancipation--a great national\r\ndrive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of\r\nenterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. My friends,\r\ntogether we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God.\r\n\r\nFrom new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more\r\nproductive, fulfilled and united people, and a stronger America--an\r\nAmerica that will lead the technological revolution, and also open its\r\nmind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature, music, and\r\npoetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.\r\n\r\nA dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes, will be\r\nour strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But an almost unbroken\r\n50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of\r\nreckoning. We have come to a turning point, a moment for hard decisions.\r\nI have asked the Cabinet and my staff a question, and now I put the same\r\nquestion to all of you: If not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be\r\ndone by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a\r\nbalanced budget. We can then begin reducing the national debt.\r\n\r\nI will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing\r\ngovernment program spending for the next year. Beyond that, we must take\r\nfurther steps to permanently control Government's power to tax and\r\nspend. We must act now to protect future generations from Government's\r\ndesire to spend its citizens' money and tax them into servitude when the\r\nbills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional for the Federal\r\nGovernment to spend more than the Federal Government takes in.\r\n\r\nWe have already started returning to the people and to State and local\r\ngovernments responsibilities better handled by them. Now, there is a\r\nplace for the Federal Government in matters of social compassion. But\r\nour fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the\r\ndignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged. And here a growing\r\neconomy and support from family and community offer our best chance for\r\na society where compassion is a way of life, where the old and infirm\r\nare cared for, the young and, yes, the unborn protected, and the\r\nunfortunate looked after and made self-sufficient.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another area where the Federal Government can play a part.\r\nAs an older American, I remember a time when people of different race,\r\ncreed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed\r\nin social custom and, yes, in law. There is no story more heartening in\r\nour history than the progress that we have made toward the \"brotherhood\r\nof man\" that God intended for us. Let us resolve there will be no\r\nturning back or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and\r\nabundant with opportunity for all our citizens.\r\n\r\nLet us resolve that we the people will build an American opportunity\r\nsociety in which all of us--white and black, rich and poor, young and\r\nold--will go forward together arm in arm. Again, let us remember that\r\nthough our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the\r\nEarth, we are all Americans pledged to carry on this last, best hope of\r\nman on Earth.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations which we should\r\nput on our National Government. Now let me turn to a task which is the\r\nprimary responsibility of National Government--the safety and security\r\nof our people.\r\n\r\nToday, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for\r\npeace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace will not come, nor will\r\nour freedom be preserved, by good will alone. There are those in the\r\nworld who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom. One nation, the\r\nSoviet Union, has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history\r\nof man, building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons.\r\n\r\nWe have made progress in restoring our defense capability. But much\r\nremains to be done. There must be no wavering by us, nor any doubts by\r\nothers, that America will meet her responsibilities to remain free,\r\nsecure, and at peace.\r\n\r\nThere is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of\r\nnational security, and that is to reduce the need for it. And this we\r\nare trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union. We are not just\r\ndiscussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons. We seek,\r\ninstead, to reduce their number. We seek the total elimination one day\r\nof nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.\r\n\r\nNow, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat of\r\nmutual assured destruction; if either resorted to the use of nuclear\r\nweapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started\r\nit. Is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side\r\nthreatens to kill tens of millions of our people, our only recourse is\r\nto threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?\r\n\r\nI have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security shield\r\nthat would destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target. It\r\nwouldn't kill people, it would destroy weapons. It wouldn't militarize\r\nspace, it would help demilitarize the arsenals of Earth. It would render\r\nnuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet with the Soviets, hoping that we\r\ncan agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nWe strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all around\r\nus. Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies in the\r\nworld has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march, and nowhere\r\nmore so than our own hemisphere. Freedom is one of the deepest and\r\nnoblest aspirations of the human spirit. People, worldwide, hunger for\r\nthe right of self-determination, for those inalienable rights that make\r\nfor human dignity and progress.\r\n\r\nAmerica must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is our best\r\nally.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the world's only hope, to conquer poverty and preserve peace.\r\nEvery blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark\r\nallies of oppression and war. Every victory for human freedom will be a\r\nvictory for world peace.\r\n\r\nSo we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful\r\nin its purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with our economy\r\nleading the world to a new age of economic expansion, we look forward to\r\na world rich in possibilities. And all this because we have worked and\r\nacted together, not as members of political parties, but as Americans.\r\n\r\nMy friends, we live in a world that is lit by lightning. So much is\r\nchanging and will change, but so much endures, and transcends time.\r\n\r\nHistory is a ribbon, always unfurling; history is a journey. And as we\r\ncontinue our journey, we think of those who traveled before us. We stand\r\ntogether again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy--or we would\r\nhave been standing at the steps if it hadn't gotten so cold. Now we are\r\nstanding inside this symbol of our democracy. Now we hear again the\r\nechoes of our past: a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of\r\nValley Forge; a lonely President paces the darkened halls, and ponders\r\nhis struggle to preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out\r\nencouragement to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and\r\nthe song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.\r\n\r\nIt is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic,\r\ndaring, decent, and fair. That's our heritage; that is our song. We sing\r\nit still. For all our problems, our differences, we are together as of\r\nold, as we raise our voices to the God who is the Author of this most\r\ntender music. And may He continue to hold us close as we fill the world\r\nwith our sound--sound in unity, affection, and love--one people under\r\nGod, dedicated to the dream of freedom that He has placed in the human\r\nheart, called upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nGod bless you and may God bless America.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE BUSH, INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 1989\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note:  The 200th anniversary of the Presidency was observed\r\nas George Bush took the executive oath on the same Bible George\r\nWashington used in 1789. The ceremony occurred on a platform on the\r\nterrace of the West Front of the Capitol. The oath of office was\r\nadministered by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. After the ceremony the\r\nPresident and Mrs. Bush led the inaugural parade from the Capitol to the\r\nWhite House, walking along several blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue to\r\ngreet the spectators.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President Quayle, Senator\r\nMitchell, Speaker Wright, Senator Dole, Congressman Michel, and fellow\r\ncitizens, neighbors, and friends:\r\n\r\nThere is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in\r\nour history. President Reagan, on behalf of our Nation, I thank you for\r\nthe wonderful things that you have done for America.\r\n\r\nI have just repeated word for word the oath taken by George Washington\r\n200 years ago, and the Bible on which I placed my hand is the Bible on\r\nwhich he placed his. It is right that the memory of Washington be with\r\nus today, not only because this is our Bicentennial Inauguration, but\r\nbecause Washington remains the Father of our Country. And he would, I\r\nthink, be gladdened by this day; for today is the concrete expression of\r\na stunning fact: our continuity these 200 years since our government\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nWe meet on democracy's front porch, a good place to talk as neighbors\r\nand as friends. For this is a day when our nation is made whole, when\r\nour differences, for a moment, are suspended.\r\n\r\nAnd my first act as President is a prayer. I ask you to bow your heads:\r\n\r\nHeavenly Father, we bow our heads and thank You for Your love. Accept\r\nour thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that\r\nmakes its continuance likely. Make us strong to do Your work, willing to\r\nheed and hear Your will, and write on our hearts these words: \"Use power\r\nto help people.\" For we are given power not to advance our own purposes,\r\nnor to make a great show in the world, nor a name. There is but one just\r\nuse of power, and it is to serve people. Help us to remember it, Lord.\r\nAmen.\r\n\r\nI come before you and assume the Presidency at a moment rich with\r\npromise. We live in a peaceful, prosperous time, but we can make it\r\nbetter. For a new breeze is blowing, and a world refreshed by freedom\r\nseems reborn; for in man's heart, if not in fact, the day of the\r\ndictator is over. The totalitarian era is passing, its old ideas blown\r\naway like leaves from an ancient, lifeless tree. A new breeze is\r\nblowing, and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on.\r\nThere is new ground to be broken, and new action to be taken. There are\r\ntimes when the future seems thick as a fog; you sit and wait, hoping the\r\nmists will lift and reveal the right path. But this is a time when the\r\nfuture seems a door you can walk right through into a room called\r\ntomorrow.\r\n\r\nGreat nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door\r\nto freedom. Men and women of the world move toward free markets through\r\nthe door to prosperity. The people of the world agitate for free\r\nexpression and free thought through the door to the moral and\r\nintellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows.\r\n\r\nWe know what works: Freedom works. We know what's right: Freedom is\r\nright. We know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on\r\nEarth: through free markets, free speech, free elections, and the\r\nexercise of free will unhampered by the state.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in this century, for the first time in perhaps all\r\nhistory, man does not have to invent a system by which to live. We don't\r\nhave to talk late into the night about which form of government is\r\nbetter. We don't have to wrest justice from the kings. We only have to\r\nsummon it from within ourselves. We must act on what we know. I take as\r\nmy guide the hope of a saint: In crucial things, unity; in important\r\nthings, diversity; in all things, generosity.\r\n\r\nAmerica today is a proud, free nation, decent and civil, a place we\r\ncannot help but love. We know in our hearts, not loudly and proudly, but\r\nas a simple fact, that this country has meaning beyond what we see, and\r\nthat our strength is a force for good. But have we changed as a nation\r\neven in our time? Are we enthralled with material things, less\r\nappreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice?\r\n\r\nMy friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are not the\r\nmeasure of our lives. In our hearts we know what matters. We cannot hope\r\nonly to leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We must\r\nhope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend, a\r\nloving parent, a citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town\r\nbetter than he found it. What do we want the men and women who work with\r\nus to say when we are no longer there? That we were more driven to\r\nsucceed than anyone around us? Or that we stopped to ask if a sick child\r\nhad gotten better, and stayed a moment there to trade a word of\r\nfriendship?\r\n\r\nNo President, no government, can teach us to remember what is best in\r\nwhat we are. But if the man you have chosen to lead this government can\r\nhelp make a difference; if he can celebrate the quieter, deeper\r\nsuccesses that are made not of gold and silk, but of better hearts and\r\nfiner souls; if he can do these things, then he must.\r\n\r\nAmerica is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral\r\nprinciple. We as a people have such a purpose today. It is to make\r\nkinder the face of the Nation and gentler the face of the world. My\r\nfriends, we have work to do. There are the homeless, lost and roaming.\r\nThere are the children who have nothing, no love, no normalcy. There are\r\nthose who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever\r\naddiction--drugs, welfare, the demoralization that rules the slums.\r\nThere is crime to be conquered, the rough crime of the streets. There\r\nare young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children\r\nthey can't care for and might not love. They need our care, our\r\nguidance, and our education, though we bless them for choosing life.\r\n\r\nThe old solution, the old way, was to think that public money alone\r\ncould end these problems. But we have learned that is not so. And in any\r\ncase, our funds are low. We have a deficit to bring down. We have more\r\nwill than wallet; but will is what we need. We will make the hard\r\nchoices, looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently,\r\nmaking our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety. And then\r\nwe will do the wisest thing of all: We will turn to the only resource we\r\nhave that in times of need always grows--the goodness and the courage of\r\nthe American people.\r\n\r\nI am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others, a new\r\nactivism, hands-on and involved, that gets the job done. We must bring\r\nin the generations, harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the\r\nunfocused energy of the young. For not only leadership is passed from\r\ngeneration to generation, but so is stewardship. And the generation born\r\nafter the Second World War has come of age.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of a thousand points of light, of all the community\r\norganizations that are spread like stars throughout the Nation, doing\r\ngood. We will work hand in hand, encouraging, sometimes leading,\r\nsometimes being led, rewarding. We will work on this in the White House,\r\nin the Cabinet agencies. I will go to the people and the programs that\r\nare the brighter points of light, and I will ask every member of my\r\ngovernment to become involved. The old ideas are new again because they\r\nare not old, they are timeless: duty, sacrifice, commitment, and a\r\npatriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in.\r\n\r\nWe need a new engagement, too, between the Executive and the Congress.\r\nThe challenges before us will be thrashed out with the House and the\r\nSenate. We must bring the Federal budget into balance. And we must\r\nensure that America stands before the world united, strong, at peace,\r\nand fiscally sound. But, of course, things may be difficult. We need\r\ncompromise; we have had dissension. We need harmony; we have had a\r\nchorus of discordant voices.\r\n\r\nFor Congress, too, has changed in our time. There has grown a certain\r\ndivisiveness. We have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in\r\nwhich not each other's ideas are challenged, but each other's motives.\r\nAnd our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of\r\neach other. It has been this way since Vietnam. That war cleaves us\r\nstill. But, friends, that war began in earnest a quarter of a century\r\nago; and surely the statute of limitations has been reached. This is a\r\nfact: The final lesson of Vietnam is that no great nation can long\r\nafford to be sundered by a memory. A new breeze is blowing, and the old\r\nbipartisanship must be made new again.\r\n\r\nTo my friends--and yes, I do mean friends--in the loyal opposition--and\r\nyes, I mean loyal: I put out my hand. I am putting out my hand to you,\r\nMr. Speaker. I am putting out my hand to you Mr. Majority Leader. For\r\nthis is the thing: This is the age of the offered hand. We can't turn\r\nback clocks, and I don't want to. But when our fathers were young, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, our differences ended at the water's edge. And we don't wish to\r\nturn back time, but when our mothers were young, Mr. Majority Leader,\r\nthe Congress and the Executive were capable of working together to\r\nproduce a budget on which this nation could live. Let us negotiate soon\r\nand hard. But in the end, let us produce. The American people await\r\naction. They didn't send us here to bicker. They ask us to rise above\r\nthe merely partisan. \"In crucial things, unity\"--and this, my friends,\r\nis crucial.\r\n\r\nTo the world, too, we offer new engagement and a renewed vow: We will\r\nstay strong to protect the peace. The \"offered hand\" is a reluctant\r\nfist; but once made, strong, and can be used with great effect. There\r\nare today Americans who are held against their will in foreign lands,\r\nand Americans who are unaccounted for. Assistance can be shown here, and\r\nwill be long remembered. Good will begets good will. Good faith can be a\r\nspiral that endlessly moves on.\r\n\r\nGreat nations like great men must keep their word. When America says\r\nsomething, America means it, whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow\r\nmade on marble steps. We will always try to speak clearly, for candor is\r\na compliment, but subtlety, too, is good and has its place. While\r\nkeeping our alliances and friendships around the world strong, ever\r\nstrong, we will continue the new closeness with the Soviet Union,\r\nconsistent both with our security and with progress. One might say that\r\nour new relationship in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength\r\nover experience. But hope is good, and so are strength and vigilance.\r\n\r\nHere today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the\r\nunderstandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy\r\nand seen their hopes fulfilled. But my thoughts have been turning the\r\npast few days to those who would be watching at home to an older fellow\r\nwho will throw a salute by himself when the flag goes by, and the women\r\nwho will tell her sons the words of the battle hymns. I don't mean this\r\nto be sentimental. I mean that on days like this, we remember that we\r\nare all part of a continuum, inescapably connected by the ties that\r\nbind.\r\n\r\nOur children are watching in schools throughout our great land. And to\r\nthem I say, thank you for watching democracy's big day. For democracy\r\nbelongs to us all, and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go\r\nhigher and higher with the breeze. And to all I say: No matter what your\r\ncircumstances or where you are, you are part of this day, you are part\r\nof the life of our great nation.\r\n\r\nA President is neither prince nor pope, and I don't seek a window on\r\nmen's souls. In fact, I yearn for a greater tolerance, an\r\neasy-goingness about each other's attitudes and way of life.\r\n\r\nThere are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united\r\nand express our intolerance. The most obvious now is drugs. And when\r\nthat first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship, it may as well have been a\r\ndeadly bacteria, so much has it hurt the body, the soul of our country.\r\nAnd there is much to be done and to be said, but take my word for it:\r\nThis scourge will stop.\r\n\r\nAnd so, there is much to do; and tomorrow the work begins. I do not\r\nmistrust the future; I do not fear what is ahead. For our problems are\r\nlarge, but our heart is larger. Our challenges are great, but our will\r\nis greater. And if our flaws are endless, God's love is truly boundless.\r\n\r\nSome see leadership as high drama, and the sound of trumpets calling,\r\nand sometimes it is that. But I see history as a book with many pages,\r\nand each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning. The\r\nnew breeze blows, a page turns, the story unfolds. And so today a\r\nchapter begins, a small and stately story of unity, diversity, and\r\ngenerosity--shared, and written, together.\r\n\r\nThank you. God bless you and God bless the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nJANUARY 20, 1993\r\n\r\n\r\n[As presented on the Internet by Project Gutenberg on January 20th, 1993]\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nToday we celebrate the mystery of American renewal.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony is held in the depth of winter, but by the words we speak\r\nand the faces we show the world, we force the spring.  A spring reborn\r\nin the world's oldest democracy, that brings forth the vision and\r\ncourage to reinvent America.  When our founders boldly declared\r\nAmerica's independence to the world, and our purposes to the Almighty,\r\nthey knew that America, to endure, would have to change.  Not change for\r\nchange sake, but change to preserve America's ideals:  life, liberty,\r\nthe pursuit of happiness.\r\n\r\nThough we march to the music of our time, our mission is timeless. Each\r\ngeneration of American's must define what it means to be an American. On\r\nbehalf of our nation, I salute my predecessor, President Bush, for his\r\nhalf-century of service to America...and I thank the millions of men\r\nand women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression,\r\nfascism and communism.\r\n\r\nToday, a generation raised in the shadows of the Cold War assumes new\r\nresponsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom, but\r\nthreatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues.  Raised in\r\nunrivalled prosperity, we inherit an economy that is still the world's\r\nstrongest, but is weakened by business failures, stagnant wages,\r\nincreasing inequality, and deep divisions among *our own* people.\r\n\r\nWhen George Washington first took the oath I have just sworn to uphold,\r\nnews travelled slowly across the land by horseback, and across the ocean\r\nby boat. Now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast\r\ninstantaneously to billions around the world.  Communications and\r\ncommerce are global. Investment is mobile.  Technology is almost\r\nmagical, and ambition for a better life is now universal.\r\n\r\nWe earn our livelihood in America today in peaceful competition with\r\npeople all across the Earth.  Profound and powerful forces are shaking\r\nand remaking our world, and the *urgent* question of our time is whether\r\nwe can make change our friend and not our enemy.  This new world has\r\nalready enriched the lives of *millions* of Americans who are able to\r\ncompete and win in it.  But when most people are working harder for\r\nless, when others cannot work at all, when the cost of health care\r\ndevastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises, great and\r\nsmall; when the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens of their\r\nfreedom; and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the\r\nlives we are calling them to lead, we have not made change our friend.\r\n\r\nWe know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps, but we have\r\nnot done so.  Instead we have drifted, and that drifting has eroded our\r\nresources, fractured our economy, and shaken our confidence.  Though our\r\nchallenges are fearsome, so are our strengths.  Americans have ever been\r\na restless, questing, hopeful people, and we must bring to our task\r\ntoday the vision and will of those who came before us.  From our\r\nRevolution to the Civil War, to the Great Depression, to the Civil\r\nRights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to\r\nconstruct from these crises the pillars of our history.  Thomas\r\nJefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation\r\nwe would need dramatic change from time to time.  Well, my fellow\r\nAmericans, this is OUR time.  Let us embrace it.\r\n\r\nOur democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of\r\nour *own* renewal.  There is nothing *wrong* with America that cannot be\r\ncured by what is *right* with America.\r\n\r\nAnd so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift, and a\r\nnew season of American renewal has begun.\r\n\r\nTo renew America we must be bold.  We must do what no generation has had\r\nto do before.  We must invest more in our own people, in their jobs, and\r\nin their future, and at the same time cut our massive debt...and we\r\nmust do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity. It\r\nwill not be easy. It will require sacrifice, but it can be done, and\r\ndone fairly. Not choosing sacrifice for its own sake, but for *our* own\r\nsake. We must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its\r\nchildren.  Our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity. We can\r\ndo no less.  Anyone who has ever watched a child's eyes wander into\r\nsleep knows what posterity is.  Posterity is the world to come, the\r\nworld for whom we hold our ideals, from whom we have borrowed our\r\nplanet, and to whom we bear sacred responsibilities. We must do what\r\nAmerica does best, offer more opportunity TO all and demand more\r\nresponsibility *from* all.\r\n\r\nIt is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing:\r\nfrom our government, or from each other.  Let us all take more\r\nresponsibility, not only for ourselves and our families, but for our\r\ncommunities and our country.  To renew America we must revitalize our\r\ndemocracy.  This beautiful capitol, like every capitol since the dawn of\r\ncivilization, is often a place of intrigue and calculation. Powerful\r\npeople maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is *in* and\r\nwho is *out*, who is *up* and who is *down*, forgetting those people\r\nwhose toil and sweat sends us here and paves our way.\r\n\r\nAmericans deserve better, and in this city today there are people who\r\nwant to do better, and so I say to all of you here, let us resolve to\r\nreform our politics, so that power and privilege no longer shout down\r\nthe voice of the people.  Let us put aside personal advantage, so that\r\nwe can feel the pain and see the promise of America.  Let us resolve to\r\nmake our government a place for what Franklin Roosevelt called \"bold,\r\npersistent experimentation, a government for our tomorrows, not our\r\nyesterdays.\" Let us give this capitol back to the people to whom it\r\nbelongs.\r\n\r\nTo renew America we must meet challenges abroad, as well as at home.\r\nThere is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is\r\ndomestic.  The world economy, the world environment, the world AIDS\r\ncrisis, the world arms race:  they affect us all.  Today as an old order\r\npasses, the new world is more free, but less stable.  Communism's\r\ncollapse has called forth old animosities, and new dangers.  Clearly,\r\nAmerica must continue to lead the world we did so much to make.  While\r\nAmerica rebuilds at home, we will not shrink from the challenges nor\r\nfail to seize the opportunities of this new world. Together with our\r\nfriends and allies, we will work together to shape change, lest it\r\nengulf us.  When our vital interests are challenged, or the will and\r\nconscience of the international community is defied, we will act; with\r\npeaceful diplomacy whenever possible, with force when necessary.  The\r\nbrave Americans serving our nation today in the Persian Gulf, in\r\nSomalia, and wherever else they stand, are testament to our resolve, but\r\nour greatest strength is the power of our ideas, which are still new in\r\nmany lands.  Across the world, we see them embraced and we rejoice.  Our\r\nhopes, our hearts, our hands, are with those on every continent, who are\r\nbuilding democracy and freedom. Their cause is America's cause.  The\r\nAmerican people have summoned the change we celebrate today.  You have\r\nraised your voices in an unmistakable chorus, you have cast your votes\r\nin historic numbers, you have changed the face of congress, the\r\npresidency, and the political process itself.  Yes, *you*, my fellow\r\nAmericans, have forced the spring.  Now *we* must do the work the season\r\ndemands.  To that work I now turn with *all* the authority of my office.\r\nI ask the congress to join with me; but no president, no congress, no\r\ngovernment can undertake *this* mission alone.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, you, too, must play your part in our renewal. I\r\nchallenge a new generation of *young* Americans to a season of service,\r\nto act on your idealism, by helping troubled children, keeping company\r\nwith those in need, reconnecting our torn communities.  There is so much\r\nto be done.  Enough, indeed, for millions of others who are still young\r\nin spirit, to give of themselves in service, too.  In serving we\r\nrecognize a simple, but powerful, truth:  we need each other, and we\r\nmust care for one another.  Today we do more than celebrate America, we\r\nrededicate ourselves to the very idea of America, an idea born in\r\nrevolution, and renewed through two centuries of challenge, an idea\r\ntempered by the knowledge that but for fate, we, the fortunate and the\r\nunfortunate, might have been each other; an idea ennobled by the faith\r\nthat our nation can summon from its myriad diversity, the deepest\r\nmeasure of unity; an idea infused with the conviction that America's\r\njourney long, heroic journey must go forever upward.\r\n\r\nAnd so, my fellow Americans, as we stand at the edge of the 21st\r\nCentury, let us begin anew, with energy and hope, with faith and\r\ndiscipline, and let us work until our work is done.  The Scripture says:\r\n\"And let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due season we shall reap,\r\nif we faint not.\" From this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a\r\ncall to service in the valley.  We have heard the trumpets, we have\r\nchanged the guard, and now each in our own way, and with God's help, we\r\nmust answer the call.\r\n\r\nThank you, and God bless you all.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nJANUARY 20, 1997\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nAt this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century, let us lift\r\nour eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century.  It is\r\nour great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the\r\nedge of a new century, in a new millennium, but on the edge of a bright\r\nnew prospect in human affairs--a moment that will define our course,\r\nand our character, for decades to come.  We must keep our old democracy\r\nforever young. Guided by the ancient vision of a promised land, let us\r\nset our sights upon a land of new promise.\r\n\r\nThe promise of America was born in the 18th century out of the bold\r\nconviction that we are all created equal.  It was extended and preserved\r\nin the 19th century, when our nation spread across the continent, saved\r\nthe union, and abolished the awful scourge of slavery.\r\n\r\nThen, in turmoil and triumph, that promise exploded onto the world stage\r\nto make this the American Century.\r\n\r\nAnd what a century it has been.  America became the world's mightiest\r\nindustrial power; saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a\r\nlong cold war; and time and again, reached out across the globe to\r\nmillions who, like us, longed for the blessings of liberty.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, Americans produced a great middle class and security in\r\nold age; built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools\r\nto all; split the atom and explored the heavens; invented the computer\r\nand the microchip; and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a\r\nrevolution in civil rights for African Americans and all minorities, and\r\nextending the circle of citizenship, opportunity and dignity to women.\r\n\r\nNow, for the third time, a new century is upon us, and another time to\r\nchoose.  We began the 19th century with a choice, to spread our nation\r\nfrom coast to coast.  We began the 20th century with a choice, to\r\nharness the Industrial Revolution to our values of free enterprise,\r\nconservation, and human decency.  Those choices made all the difference.\r\nAt the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape\r\nthe forces of the Information Age and the global society, to unleash the\r\nlimitless potential of all our people, and, yes, to form a more perfect\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nWhen last we gathered, our march to this new future seemed less certain\r\nthan it does today.  We vowed then to set a clear course to renew our\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nIn these four years, we have been touched by tragedy, exhilarated by\r\nchallenge, strengthened by achievement. America stands alone as the\r\nworld's indispensable nation. Once again, our economy is the strongest\r\non Earth.  Once again, we are building stronger families, thriving\r\ncommunities, better educational opportunities, a cleaner environment.\r\nProblems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts:\r\nour streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have\r\nmoved from welfare to work.\r\n\r\nAnd once again, we have resolved for our time a great debate over the\r\nrole of government.  Today we can declare: Government is not the\r\nproblem, and government is not the solution. We--the American people--we\r\nare the solution.  Our founders understood that well and gave us a\r\ndemocracy strong enough to endure for centuries, flexible enough to face\r\nour common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day.\r\n\r\nAs times change, so government must change.  We need a new government\r\nfor a new century--humble enough not to try to solve all our problems\r\nfor us, but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for\r\nourselves; a government that is smaller, lives within its means, and\r\ndoes more with less.  Yet where it can stand up for our values and\r\ninterests in the world, and where it can give Americans the power to\r\nmake a real difference in their everyday lives, government should do\r\nmore, not less.  The preeminent mission of our new government is to give\r\nall Americans an opportunity--not a guarantee, but a real\r\nopportunity--to build better lives.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, my fellow citizens, the future is up to us. Our founders\r\ntaught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends\r\nupon responsible citizenship.  And we need a new sense of responsibility\r\nfor a new century.  There is work to do, work that government alone\r\ncannot do:  teaching children to read; hiring people off welfare rolls;\r\ncoming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help\r\nreclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime; taking time out of\r\nour own lives to serve others.\r\n\r\nEach and every one of us, in our own way, must assume personal\r\nresponsibility--not only for ourselves and our families, but for our\r\nneighbors and our nation.  Our greatest responsibility is to embrace a\r\nnew spirit of community for a new century. For any one of us to succeed,\r\nwe must succeed as one America.\r\n\r\nThe challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future--will we\r\nbe one nation, one people, with one common destiny, or not?  Will we all\r\ncome together, or come apart?\r\n\r\nThe divide of race has been America's constant curse. And each new wave\r\nof immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices. Prejudice and\r\ncontempt, cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction\r\nare no different.  These forces have nearly destroyed our nation in the\r\npast.  They plague us still. They fuel the fanaticism of terror.  And\r\nthey torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThese obsessions cripple both those who hate and, of course, those who\r\nare hated, robbing both of what they might become. We cannot, we will\r\nnot, succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the\r\nsoul everywhere.  We shall overcome them. And we shall replace them with\r\nthe generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another.\r\n\r\nOur rich texture of racial, religious and political diversity will be a\r\nGodsend in the 21st century.  Great rewards will come to those who can\r\nlive together, learn together, work together, forge new ties that bind\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAs this new era approaches we can already see its broad outlines. Ten\r\nyears ago, the Internet was the mystical province of physicists; today,\r\nit is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren.\r\nScientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life. Cures for our\r\nmost feared illnesses seem close at hand.\r\n\r\nThe world is no longer divided into two hostile camps. Instead, now we\r\nare building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries.  Growing\r\nconnections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the\r\nfortunes and spirits of people the world over. And for the very first\r\ntime in all of history, more people on this planet live under democracy\r\nthan dictatorship.\r\n\r\nMy fellow Americans, as we look back at this remarkable century, we may\r\nask, can we hope not just to follow, but even to surpass the\r\nachievements of the 20th century in America and to avoid the awful\r\nbloodshed that stained its legacy?  To that question, every American\r\nhere and every American in our land today must answer a resounding\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the heart of our task.  With a new vision of government, a new\r\nsense of responsibility, a new spirit of community, we will sustain\r\nAmerica's journey.  The promise we sought in a new land we will find\r\nagain in a land of new promise.\r\n\r\nIn this new land, education will be every citizen's most prized\r\npossession.  Our schools will have the highest standards in the world,\r\nigniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every\r\nboy.  And the doors of higher education will be open to all.  The\r\nknowledge and power of the Information Age will be within reach not just\r\nof the few, but of every classroom, every library, every child.  Parents\r\nand children will have time not only to work, but to read and play\r\ntogether.  And the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those\r\nof a better home, a better job, the certain chance to go to college.\r\n\r\nOur streets will echo again with the laughter of our children, because\r\nno one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore. Everyone who\r\ncan work, will work, with today's permanent under class part of\r\ntomorrow's growing middle class.  New miracles of medicine at last will\r\nreach not only those who can claim care now, but the children and\r\nhardworking families too long denied.\r\n\r\nWe will stand mighty for peace and freedom, and maintain a strong\r\ndefense against terror and destruction.  Our children will sleep free\r\nfrom the threat of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.  Ports and\r\nairports, farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and\r\nideas. And the world's greatest democracy will lead a whole world of\r\ndemocracies.\r\n\r\nOur land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations--a\r\nnation that balances its budget, but never loses the balance of its\r\nvalues. A nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and\r\nhealth care, and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms\r\nnecessary to sustain those benefits for their time.  A nation that\r\nfortifies the world's most productive economy even as it protects the\r\ngreat natural bounty of our water, air, and majestic land.\r\n\r\nAnd in this land of new promise, we will have reformed our politics so\r\nthat the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of\r\nnarrow interests--regaining the participation and deserving the trust of\r\nall Americans.\r\n\r\nFellow citizens, let us build that America, a nation ever moving forward\r\ntoward realizing the full potential of all its citizens.  Prosperity and\r\npower--yes, they are important, and we must maintain them.  But let us\r\nnever forget:  The greatest progress we have made, and the greatest\r\nprogress we have yet to make, is in the human heart.  In the end, all\r\nthe world's wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength\r\nand decency of the human spirit.\r\n\r\nThirty-four years ago, the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us\r\ndown there, at the other end of this Mall, in words that moved the\r\nconscience of a nation.  Like a prophet of old, he told of his dream\r\nthat one day America would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals\r\nbefore the law and in the heart.  Martin Luther King's dream was the\r\nAmerican Dream.  His quest is our quest: the ceaseless striving to live\r\nout our true creed.  Our history has been built on such dreams and\r\nlabors.  And by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of\r\nAmerica in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nTo that effort I pledge all my strength and every power of my office. I\r\nask the members of Congress here to join in that pledge. The American\r\npeople returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of\r\nanother.  Surely, they did not do this to advance the politics of petty\r\nbickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore.  No, they call\r\non us instead to be repairers of the breach, and to move on with\r\nAmerica's mission.\r\n\r\nAmerica demands and deserves big things from us--and nothing big ever\r\ncame from being small.  Let us remember the timeless wisdom of Cardinal\r\nBernardin, when facing the end of his own life.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"It is wrong to waste the precious gift of time, on acrimony and\r\ndivision.\"\r\n\r\nFellow citizens, we must not waste the precious gift of this time. For\r\nall of us are on that same journey of our lives, and our journey, too,\r\nwill come to an end.  But the journey of our America must go on.\r\n\r\nAnd so, my fellow Americans, we must be strong, for there is much to\r\ndare. The demands of our time are great and they are different.  Let us\r\nmeet them with faith and courage, with patience and a grateful and happy\r\nheart. Let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our\r\nhistory. Yes, let us build our bridge.  A bridge wide enough and strong\r\nenough for every American to cross over to a blessed land of new\r\npromise.\r\n\r\nMay those generations whose faces we cannot yet see, whose names we may\r\nnever know, say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new\r\ncentury with the American Dream alive for all her children; with the\r\nAmerican promise of a more perfect union a reality for all her people;\r\nwith America's bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nFrom the height of this place and the summit of this century, let us go\r\nforth.  May God strengthen our hands for the good work ahead--and\r\nalways, always bless our America.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. BUSH, FIRST INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, JANUARY 20, 2001\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident Clinton, distinguished guests and my fellow citizens, the\r\npeaceful transfer of authority is rare in history, yet common in our\r\ncountry.  With a simple oath, we affirm old traditions and make new\r\nbeginnings.\r\n\r\nAs I begin, I thank President Clinton for his service to our nation.\r\n\r\nAnd I thank Vice President Gore for a contest conducted with spirit and\r\nended with grace.\r\n\r\nI am honored and humbled to stand here, where so many of America's\r\nleaders have come before me, and so many will follow.\r\n\r\nWe have a place, all of us, in a long story--a story we continue, but\r\nwhose end we will not see.  It is the story of a new world that became a\r\nfriend and liberator of the old, a story of a slave-holding society that\r\nbecame a servant of freedom, the story of a power that went into the\r\nworld to protect but not possess, to defend but not to conquer.\r\n\r\nIt is the American story--a story of flawed and fallible people, united\r\nacross the generations by grand and enduring ideals.\r\n\r\nThe grandest of these ideals is an unfolding American promise that\r\neveryone belongs, that everyone deserves a chance, that no insignificant\r\nperson was ever born.\r\n\r\nAmericans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws.\r\nAnd though our nation has sometimes halted, and sometimes delayed, we\r\nmust follow no other course.\r\n\r\nThrough much of the last century, America's faith in freedom and\r\ndemocracy was a rock in a raging sea.  Now it is a seed upon the wind,\r\ntaking root in many nations.\r\n\r\nOur democratic faith is more than the creed of our country, it is the\r\ninborn hope of our humanity, an ideal we carry but do not own, a trust\r\nwe bear and pass along.  And even after nearly 225 years, we have a long\r\nway yet to travel.\r\n\r\nWhile many of our citizens prosper, others doubt the promise, even the\r\njustice, of our own country.  The ambitions of some Americans are\r\nlimited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of\r\ntheir birth.  And sometimes our differences run so deep, it seems we\r\nshare a continent, but not a country.\r\n\r\nWe do not accept this, and we will not allow it.  Our unity, our union,\r\nis the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation.  And\r\nthis is my solemn pledge:  I will work to build a single nation of\r\njustice and opportunity.\r\n\r\nI know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than\r\nourselves who creates us equal in His image.\r\n\r\nAnd we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward.\r\n\r\nAmerica has never been united by blood or birth or soil.  We are bound\r\nby ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds, lift us above our\r\ninterests and teach us what it means to be citizens.  Every child must\r\nbe taught these principles.  Every citizen must uphold them.  And every\r\nimmigrant, by embracing these ideals, makes our country more, not less,\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nToday, we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation's promise\r\nthrough civility, courage, compassion and character.\r\n\r\nAmerica, at its best, matches a commitment to principle with a concern\r\nfor civility.  A civil society demands from each of us good will and\r\nrespect, fair dealing and forgiveness.\r\n\r\nSome seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because,\r\nin a time of peace, the stakes of our debates appear small.\r\n\r\nBut the stakes for America are never small.  If our country does not\r\nlead the cause of freedom, it will not be led.  If we do not turn the\r\nhearts of children toward knowledge and character, we will lose their\r\ngifts and undermine their idealism.  If we permit our economy to drift\r\nand decline, the vulnerable will suffer most.\r\n\r\nWe must live up to the calling we share.  Civility is not a tactic or a\r\nsentiment.  It is the determined choice of trust over cynicism, of\r\ncommunity over chaos.  And this commitment, if we keep it, is a way to\r\nshared accomplishment.\r\n\r\nAmerica, at its best, is also courageous.\r\n\r\nOur national courage has been clear in times of depression and war, when\r\ndefending common dangers defined our common good.  Now we must choose if\r\nthe example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us.\r\nWe must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems\r\ninstead of passing them on to future generations.\r\n\r\nTogether, we will reclaim America's schools, before ignorance and apathy\r\nclaim more young lives.\r\n\r\nWe will reform Social Security and Medicare, sparing our children from\r\nstruggles we have the power to prevent.  And we will reduce taxes, to\r\nrecover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise\r\nof working Americans.\r\n\r\nWe will build our defenses beyond challenge, lest weakness invite\r\nchallenge.\r\n\r\nWe will confront weapons of mass destruction, so that a new century is\r\nspared new horrors.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake:  America\r\nremains engaged in the world by history and by choice, shaping a balance\r\nof power that favors freedom.  We will defend our allies and our\r\ninterests.  We will show purpose without arrogance.  We will meet\r\naggression and bad faith with resolve and strength.  And to all nations,\r\nwe will speak for the values that gave our nation birth.\r\n\r\nAmerica, at its best, is compassionate.  In the quiet of American\r\nconscience, we know that deep, persistent poverty is unworthy of our\r\nnation's promise.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever our views of its cause, we can agree that children at risk\r\nare not at fault.  Abandonment and abuse are not acts of God, they are\r\nfailures of love.\r\n\r\nAnd the proliferation of prisons, however necessary, is no substitute\r\nfor hope and order in our souls.\r\n\r\nWhere there is suffering, there is duty.  Americans in need are not\r\nstrangers, they are citizens, not problems, but priorities.  And all of\r\nus are diminished when any are hopeless.\r\n\r\nGovernment has great responsibilities for public safety and public\r\nhealth, for civil rights and common schools.  Yet compassion is the work\r\nof a nation, not just a government.\r\n\r\nAnd some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a\r\nmentor's touch or a pastor's prayer.  Church and charity, synagogue and\r\nmosque lend our communities their humanity, and they will have an\r\nhonored place in our plans and in our laws.\r\n\r\nMany in our country do not know the pain of poverty, but we can listen\r\nto those who do.\r\n\r\nAnd I can pledge our nation to a goal:  When we see that wounded\r\ntraveler on the road to Jericho, we will not pass to the other side.\r\n\r\nAmerica, at its best, is a place where personal responsibility is valued\r\nand expected.\r\n\r\nEncouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats, it is a call\r\nto conscience.  And though it requires sacrifice, it brings a deeper\r\nfulfillment.  We find the fullness of life not only in options, but in\r\ncommitments.  And we find that children and community are the\r\ncommitments that set us free.\r\n\r\nOur public interest depends on private character, on civic duty and\r\nfamily bonds and basic fairness, on uncounted, unhonored acts of decency\r\nwhich give direction to our freedom.\r\n\r\nSometimes in life we are called to do great things.  But as a saint of\r\nour times has said, every day we are called to do small things with\r\ngreat love.  The most important tasks of a democracy are done by\r\neveryone.\r\n\r\nI will live and lead by these principles: to advance my convictions with\r\ncivility, to pursue the public interest with courage, to speak for\r\ngreater justice and compassion, to call for responsibility and try to\r\nlive it as well.\r\n\r\nIn all these ways, I will bring the values of our history to the care of\r\nour times.\r\n\r\nWhat you do is as important as anything government does.  I ask you to\r\nseek a common good beyond your comfort; to defend needed reforms against\r\neasy attacks; to serve your nation, beginning with your neighbor.  I ask\r\nyou to be citizens: citizens, not spectators; citizens, not subjects;\r\nresponsible citizens, building communities of service and a nation of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAmericans are generous and strong and decent, not because we believe in\r\nourselves, but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves.  When this\r\nspirit of citizenship is missing, no government program can replace it.\r\nWhen this spirit is present, no wrong can stand against it.\r\n\r\nAfter the Declaration of Independence was signed, Virginia statesman\r\nJohn Page wrote to Thomas Jefferson:  \"We know the race is not to the\r\nswift nor the battle to the strong.  Do you not think an angel rides in\r\nthe whirlwind and directs this storm?\"\r\n\r\nMuch time has passed since Jefferson arrived for his inauguration.  The\r\nyears and changes accumulate.  But the themes of this day he would know:\r\nour nation's grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity.\r\n\r\nWe are not this story's author, who fills time and eternity with his\r\npurpose.  Yet his purpose is achieved in our duty, and our duty is\r\nfulfilled in service to one another.\r\n\r\nNever tiring, never yielding, never finishing, we renew that purpose\r\ntoday, to make our country more just and generous, to affirm the dignity\r\nof our lives and every life.\r\n\r\nThis work continues.  This story goes on.  And an angel still rides in\r\nthe whirlwind and directs this storm.\r\n\r\nGod bless you all, and God bless America.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE W. BUSH, SECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY, JANUARY 20, 2005\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVice President Cheney, Mr. Chief Justice, President Carter, President\r\nBush, President Clinton, reverend clergy, distinguished guests, fellow\r\ncitizens:\r\n\r\nOn this day, prescribed by law and marked by ceremony, we celebrate the\r\ndurable wisdom of our Constitution, and recall the deep commitments that\r\nunite our country. I am grateful for the honor of this hour, mindful of\r\nthe consequential times in which we live, and determined to fulfill the\r\noath that I have sworn and you have witnessed.\r\n\r\nAt this second gathering, our duties are defined not by the words I use,\r\nbut by the history we have seen together. For a half century, America\r\ndefended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders. After the\r\nshipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet, years of repose,\r\nyears of sabbatical--and then there came a day of fire.\r\n\r\nWe have seen our vulnerability--and we have seen its deepest source. For\r\nas long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and\r\ntyranny--prone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse\r\nmurder--violence will gather, and multiply in destructive power, and\r\ncross the most defended borders, and raise a mortal threat. There is\r\nonly one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and\r\nresentment, and expose the pretensions of tyrants, and reward the hopes\r\nof the decent and tolerant, and that is the force of human freedom.\r\n\r\nWe are led, by events and common sense, to one conclusion:  The survival\r\nof liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in\r\nother lands. The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of\r\nfreedom in all the world.\r\n\r\nAmerica's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one. From the\r\nday of our Founding, we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this\r\nearth has rights, and dignity, and matchless value, because they bear\r\nthe image of the Maker of Heaven and earth. Across the generations we\r\nhave proclaimed the imperative of self-government, because no one is fit\r\nto be a master, and no one deserves to be a slave. Advancing these\r\nideals is the mission that created our Nation. It is the honorable\r\nachievement of our fathers. Now it is the urgent requirement of our\r\nnation's security, and the calling of our time.\r\n\r\nSo it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth\r\nof democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture,\r\nwith the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world.\r\n\r\nThis is not primarily the task of arms, though we will defend ourselves\r\nand our friends by force of arms when necessary. Freedom, by its nature,\r\nmust be chosen, and defended by citizens, and sustained by the rule of\r\nlaw and the protection of minorities. And when the soul of a nation\r\nfinally speaks, the institutions that arise may reflect customs and\r\ntraditions very different from our own. America will not impose our own\r\nstyle of government on the unwilling. Our goal instead is to help others\r\nfind their own voice, attain their own freedom, and make their own way.\r\n\r\nThe great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of\r\ngenerations. The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it.\r\nAmerica's influence is not unlimited, but fortunately for the oppressed,\r\nAmerica's influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in\r\nfreedom's cause.\r\n\r\nMy most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people against\r\nfurther attacks and emerging threats. Some have unwisely chosen to test\r\nAmerica's resolve, and have found it firm.\r\n\r\nWe will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every\r\nnation:  The moral choice between oppression, which is always wrong, and\r\nfreedom, which is eternally right. America will not pretend that jailed\r\ndissidents prefer their chains, or that women welcome humiliation and\r\nservitude, or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of\r\nbullies.\r\n\r\nWe will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that\r\nsuccess in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own\r\npeople. America's belief in human dignity will guide our policies, yet\r\nrights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators; they are\r\nsecured by free dissent and the participation of the governed. In the\r\nlong run, there is no justice without freedom, and there can be no human\r\nrights without human liberty.\r\n\r\nSome, I know, have questioned the global appeal of liberty--though this\r\ntime in history, four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom\r\never seen, is an odd time for doubt. Americans, of all people, should\r\nnever be surprised by the power of our ideals. Eventually, the call of\r\nfreedom comes to every mind and every soul. We do not accept the\r\nexistence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility\r\nof permanent slavery. Liberty will come to those who love it.\r\n\r\nToday, America speaks anew to the peoples of the world:\r\n\r\nAll who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know: the United States\r\nwill not ignore your oppression, or excuse your oppressors. When you\r\nstand for your liberty, we will stand with you.\r\n\r\nDemocratic reformers facing repression, prison, or exile can know:\r\nAmerica sees you for who you are: the future leaders of your free\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham\r\nLincoln did:  \"Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for\r\nthemselves; and, under the rule of a just God, cannot long retain it.\"\r\n\r\nThe leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know:  To\r\nserve your people you must learn to trust them. Start on this journey of\r\nprogress and justice, and America will walk at your side.\r\n\r\nAnd all the allies of the United States can know: we honor your\r\nfriendship, we rely on your counsel, and we depend on your help.\r\nDivision among free nations is a primary goal of freedom's enemies. The\r\nconcerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to\r\nour enemies' defeat.\r\n\r\nToday, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nFrom all of you, I have asked patience in the hard task of securing\r\nAmerica, which you have granted in good measure. Our country has\r\naccepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be\r\ndishonorable to abandon. Yet because we have acted in the great\r\nliberating tradition of this nation, tens of millions have achieved\r\ntheir freedom. And as hope kindles hope, millions more will find it. By\r\nour efforts, we have lit a fire as well--a fire in the minds of men. It\r\nwarms those who feel its power, it burns those who fight its progress,\r\nand one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners\r\nof our world.\r\n\r\nA few Americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause--in the\r\nquiet work of intelligence and diplomacy...the idealistic work of\r\nhelping raise up free governments...the dangerous and necessary work\r\nof fighting our enemies. Some have shown their devotion to our country\r\nin deaths that honored their whole lives--and we will always honor their\r\nnames and their sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAll Americans have witnessed this idealism, and some for the first time.\r\nI ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes. You\r\nhave seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers.\r\nYou have seen that life is fragile, and evil is real, and courage\r\ntriumphs. Make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants,\r\nlarger than yourself--and in your days you will add not just to the\r\nwealth of our country, but to its character.\r\n\r\nAmerica has need of idealism and courage, because we have essential work\r\nat home--the unfinished work of American freedom. In a world moving\r\ntoward liberty, we are determined to show the meaning and promise of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nIn America's ideal of freedom, citizens find the dignity and security of\r\neconomic independence, instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence.\r\nThis is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the Homestead\r\nAct, the Social Security Act, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. And now we\r\nwill extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the\r\nneeds of our time. To give every American a stake in the promise and\r\nfuture of our country, we will bring the highest standards to our\r\nschools, and build an ownership society. We will widen the ownership of\r\nhomes and businesses, retirement savings and health insurance--preparing\r\nour people for the challenges of life in a free society. By making every\r\ncitizen an agent of his or her own destiny, we will give our fellow\r\nAmericans greater freedom from want and fear, and make our society more\r\nprosperous and just and equal.\r\n\r\nIn America's ideal of freedom, the public interest depends on private\r\ncharacter--on integrity, and tolerance toward others, and the rule of\r\nconscience in our own lives. Self-government relies, in the end, on the\r\ngoverning of the self. That edifice of character is built in families,\r\nsupported by communities with standards, and sustained in our national\r\nlife by the truths of Sinai, the Sermon on the Mount, the words of the\r\nKoran, and the varied faiths of our people. Americans move forward in\r\nevery generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came\r\nbefore--ideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday,\r\ntoday, and forever.\r\n\r\nIn America's ideal of freedom, the exercise of rights is ennobled by\r\nservice, and mercy, and a heart for the weak. Liberty for all does not\r\nmean independence from one another. Our nation relies on men and women\r\nwho look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love. Americans, at\r\nour best, value the life we see in one another, and must always remember\r\nthat even the unwanted have worth. And our country must abandon all the\r\nhabits of racism, because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the\r\nbaggage of bigotry at the same time.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of a single day, including this day of dedication,\r\nthe issues and questions before our country are many. From the viewpoint\r\nof centuries, the questions that come to us are narrowed and few. Did\r\nour generation advance the cause of freedom?  And did our character\r\nbring credit to that cause?\r\n\r\nThese questions that judge us also unite us, because Americans of every\r\nparty and background, Americans by choice and by birth, are bound to one\r\nanother in the cause of freedom. We have known divisions, which must be\r\nhealed to move forward in great purposes--and I will strive in good\r\nfaith to heal them. Yet those divisions do not define America. We felt\r\nthe unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack,\r\nand our response came like a single hand over a single heart. And we can\r\nfeel that same unity and pride whenever America acts for good, and the\r\nvictims of disaster are given hope, and the unjust encounter justice,\r\nand the captives are set free.\r\n\r\nWe go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of\r\nfreedom. Not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability; it is\r\nhuman choices that move events. Not because we consider ourselves a\r\nchosen nation; God moves and chooses as He wills. We have confidence\r\nbecause freedom is the permanent hope of mankind, the hunger in dark\r\nplaces, the longing of the soul. When our Founders declared a new order\r\nof the ages; when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on\r\nliberty; when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner\r\n\"Freedom Now\"--they were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be\r\nfulfilled. History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has\r\na visible direction, set by liberty and the Author of Liberty.\r\n\r\nWhen the Declaration of Independence was first read in public and the\r\nLiberty Bell was sounded in celebration, a witness said, \"It rang as if\r\nit meant something.\"  In our time it means something still. America, in\r\nthis young century, proclaims liberty throughout all the world, and to\r\nall the inhabitants thereof. Renewed in our strength--tested, but not\r\nweary--we are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nMay God bless you, and may He watch over the United States of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES--PRESIDENTS WHO WERE NOT INAUGURATED\r\n\r\nJOHN TYLER\r\nVice President John Tyler became President upon William Henry\r\nHarrison's death one month after his inauguration.
