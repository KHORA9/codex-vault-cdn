The Man in the Iron Mask we’re\r\nfamiliar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition.\r\n[Not all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the\r\nconfusion...but wait...there’s yet more reason for confusion.]\r\n\r\nWe intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four\r\netexts entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la\r\nVallière, and The Man in the Iron Mask.\r\n\r\nOne thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,\r\nentitled Ten Years Later, says it’s the sequel to The Three Musketeers.\r\nWhile this is technically true, there’s another book, Twenty Years\r\nAfter, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts\r\nthat we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years\r\nAfter, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty\r\nYears “After” the original story...however, this is why the different\r\nwords “After” and “Later”...the Ten Years “After” is ten years after\r\nthe Twenty Years later...as per history. Also, the third book of the\r\nD’Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the\r\nsubtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different\r\nvolumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the\r\nfirst volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later\r\ncan, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the\r\nfour-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,\r\nit refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material\r\nin the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the\r\nseries which may prove helpful:\r\n\r\nThe Three Musketeers: Etext 1257--First book of the D’Artagnan Romances.\r\nCovers the years 1625-1628.\r\n\r\nTwenty Years After: Etext 1259--Second book of the D’Artagnan Romances.\r\nCovers the years 1648-1649. [Third in the order that we published, but\r\nsecond in time sequence!!!]\r\n\r\nTen Years Later: Etext 1258--First 104 chapters of the third book of the\r\nD’Artagnan Romances.

It was based, he claimed, on some manuscripts he had\r\nfound a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale while researching a\r\nhistory he planned to write on Louis XIV. They chronicled the adventures\r\nof a young man named D’Artagnan who, upon entering Paris, became almost\r\nimmediately embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and\r\nill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over the next six years, readers\r\nwould enjoy the adventures of this youth and his three famous friends,\r\nPorthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits unraveled behind the\r\nscenes of some of the most momentous events in French and even English\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nEventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form,\r\nand became the three D’Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief\r\nsummary of the first two novels:\r\n\r\nThe Three Musketeers (serialized March--July, 1844): The year is 1625.\r\nThe young D’Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and\r\nalmost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.\r\nInstead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal’s\r\nguards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.\r\nThe four become fast friends, and, when asked by D’Artagnan’s landlord\r\nto find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them\r\nacross both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the\r\nCardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,\r\nnamed simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of\r\nAustria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the\r\nfour friends.\r\n\r\nTwenty Years After (serialized January--August, 1845): The year is now\r\n1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has\r\ndied, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit\r\nupon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV,\r\nthe real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.\r\nD’Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have\r\nretired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de\r\nla Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.\r\nAramis, whose real name is D’Herblay, has followed his intention of\r\nshedding the musketeer’s cassock for the priest’s robes, and Porthos has\r\nmarried a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But\r\ntrouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the\r\ninstitution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at\r\nhome the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D’Artagnan brings\r\nhis friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,\r\nbut Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother’s death\r\nat the musketeers’ hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our\r\nheroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,\r\nquiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.\r\n\r\nThe third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October,\r\n1847--January, 1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English\r\ntranslation. It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at\r\nvarious points in its history. The five-volume edition generally does\r\nnot give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do. In the\r\nthree-volume edition, the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne,\r\nLouise de la Vallière, and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of\r\nthis etext, I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition\r\ndoes, with these titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later,\r\nLouise de la Vallière, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In the first three\r\netexts:\r\n\r\nThe Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and\r\nD’Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become\r\ndisgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with\r\nthe Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on\r\nhis own project, that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England,\r\nand, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune\r\nin the process. D’Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich\r\ncitizen, and Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king’s\r\nbrother, to Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own\r\nestate, La Fere. Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to\r\nassume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly\r\nMazarin’s trusted clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet,\r\nthe king’s superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any\r\nmeans necessary to bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant\r\nbestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet’s\r\nloyal friends tried and executed. He then brings to the king’s attention\r\nthat Fouquet is fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could\r\npossibly be planning to use it as a base for some military operation\r\nagainst the king. Louis calls D’Artagnan out of retirement and sends\r\nhim to investigate the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his\r\nlong-promised promotion to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At\r\nBelle-Isle, D’Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications\r\nis, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that’s not all.\r\nThe blueprints for the island, although in Porthos’s handwriting,\r\nshow evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis.\r\nD’Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes,\r\nwhich is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting\r\nthat D’Artagnan has arrived on the king’s behalf to investigate, Aramis\r\ntricks D’Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos,\r\nand sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of\r\nthe danger. Fouquet rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a\r\npresent, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating\r\nColbert, just minutes before the usher announces someone else seeking an\r\naudience with the king.\r\n\r\nTen Years Later (Etext 2681): As 1661 approaches, Princess Henrietta of\r\nEngland arrives for her marriage, and throws the court of France into\r\ncomplete disorder. The jealousy of the Duke of Buckingham, who is\r\nin love with her, nearly occasions a war on the streets of Le Havre,\r\nthankfully prevented by Raoul’s timely and tactful intervention. After\r\nthe marriage, though, Monsieur Philip becomes horribly jealous of\r\nBuckingham, and has him exiled. Before leaving, however, the duke\r\nfights a duel with M. de Wardes at Calais. De Wardes is a malicious and\r\nspiteful man, the sworn enemy of D’Artagnan, and, by the same token,\r\nthat of Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and Raoul as well. Both men are\r\nseriously wounded, and the duke is taken back to England to recover.\r\nRaoul’s friend, the Comte de Guiche, is the next to succumb to\r\nHenrietta’s charms, and Monsieur obtains his exile as well, though De\r\nGuiche soon effects a reconciliation. But then the king’s eye falls on\r\nMadame Henrietta during the comte’s absence, and this time Monsieur’s\r\njealousy has no recourse. Anne of Austria intervenes, and the king and\r\nhis sister-in-law decide to pick a young lady with whom the king\r\ncan pretend to be in love, the better to mask their own affair. They\r\nunfortunately select Louise de la Vallière, Raoul’s fiancee. While the\r\ncourt is in residence at Fontainebleau, the king unwitting overhears\r\nLouise confessing her love for him while chatting with her friends\r\nbeneath the royal oak, and the king promptly forgets his affection for\r\nMadame. That same night, Henrietta overhears, at the same oak, De\r\nGuiche confessing his love for her to Raoul. The two embark on their\r\nown affair. A few days later, during a rainstorm, Louis and Louise\r\nare trapped alone together, and the whole court begins to talk of the\r\nscandal while their love affair blossoms. Aware of Louise’s attachment,\r\nthe king arranges for Raoul to be sent to England for an indefinite\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the struggle for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert.\r\nAlthough the Belle-Isle plot backfired, Colbert prompts the king to ask\r\nFouquet for more and more money, and without his two friends to raise it\r\nfor him, Fouquet is sorely pressed. The situation gets so bad that his\r\nnew mistress, Madame de Belliere, must resort to selling all her jewels\r\nand her gold and silver plate. Aramis, while this is going on, has grown\r\nfriendly with the governor of the Bastile, M. de Baisemeaux, a fact that\r\nBaisemeaux unwittingly reveals to D’Artagnan while inquiring of him\r\nas to Aramis’s whereabouts. This further arouses the suspicions of the\r\nmusketeer, who was made to look ridiculous by Aramis. He had ridden\r\novernight at an insane pace, but arrived a few minutes after Fouquet\r\nhad already presented Belle-Isle to the king. Aramis learns from the\r\ngovernor the location of a mysterious prisoner, who bears a remarkable\r\nresemblance to Louis XIV--in fact, the two are identical. He uses\r\nthe existence of this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk, the\r\ngeneral of the society of the Jesuits, to name him, Aramis, the new\r\ngeneral of the order. On Aramis’s advice, hoping to use Louise’s\r\ninfluence with the king to counteract Colbert’s influence, Fouquet also\r\nwrites a love letter to La Vallière, unfortunately undated. It never\r\nreaches its destination, however, as the servant ordered to deliver it\r\nturns out to be an agent of Colbert’s.\r\n\r\nLouise de la Vallière (Etext 2710): Believing D’Artagnan occupied at\r\nFontainebleau and Porthos safely tucked away at Paris, Aramis holds a\r\nfuneral for the dead Franciscan--but in fact, Aramis is wrong in both\r\nsuppositions. D’Artagnan has left Fontainebleau, bored to tears by\r\nthe _fetes_, retrieved Porthos, and is visiting the country-house of\r\nPlanchet, his old lackey. This house happens to be right next door\r\nto the graveyard, and upon observing Aramis at this funeral, and his\r\nsubsequent meeting with a mysterious hooded lady, D’Artagnan, suspicions\r\naroused, resolves to make a little trouble for the bishop. He presents\r\nPorthos to the king at the same time as Fouquet presents Aramis, thereby\r\nsurprising the wily prelate. Aramis’s professions of affection and\r\ninnocence do only a little to allay D’Artagnan’s concerns, and he\r\ncontinues to regard Aramis’s actions with a curious and wary eye.\r\nMeanwhile, much to his delight, Porthos is invited to dine with the king\r\nas a result of his presentation, and with D’Artagnan’s guidance, manages\r\nto behave in such a manner as to procure the king’s marked favor.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious woman turns out to be the Duchesse de Chevreuse, a\r\nnotorious schemer and former friend of Anne of Austria. She comes\r\nbearing more bad news for Fouquet, who is already in trouble, as the\r\nking has invited himself to a _fete_ at Vaux, Fouquet’s magnificent\r\nmansion, that will surely bankrupt the poor superintendent. The Duchesse\r\nhas letters from Mazarin that prove that Fouquet has received thirteen\r\nmillion francs from the royal coffers, and she wishes to sell these\r\nletters to Aramis. Aramis refuses, and the letters are instead sold to\r\nColbert. Fouquet, meanwhile, discovers that the receipt that proves his\r\ninnocence in the affair has been stolen from him. Even worse, Fouquet,\r\ndesperate for money, is forced to sell the parliamentary position that\r\nrenders him untouchable by any court proceedings. As part of her deal\r\nwith Colbert, though, Chevreuse also obtains a secret audience with the\r\nqueen-mother, where the two discuss a shocking secret--Louis XIV has a\r\ntwin brother, long believed, however, to be dead.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in other quarters, De Wardes, Raoul’s inveterate enemy, has\r\nreturned from Calais, barely recovered from his wounds, and no sooner\r\ndoes he return than he begins again to insult people, particularly La\r\nVallière, and this time the comte de Guiche is the one to challenge him.\r\nThe duel leaves De Guiche horribly wounded, but enables Madame to use\r\nher influence to destroy De Wardes’s standing at court. The _fetes_,\r\nhowever, come to an end, and the court returns to Paris. The king has\r\nbeen more than obvious about his affections for Louise, and Madame,\r\nthe queen-mother, and the queen join forces to destroy her. She is\r\ndishonorably discharged from court, and in despair, she flees to the\r\nconvent at Chaillot. Along the way, though, she runs into D’Artagnan,\r\nwho manages to get word back to the king of what has taken place. By\r\nliterally begging Madame in tears, Louis manages to secure Louise’s\r\nreturn to court--but Madame still places every obstacle possible before\r\nthe lovers. They have to resort to building a secret staircase and\r\nmeeting in the apartments of M. de Saint-Aignan, where Louis has a\r\npainter create a portrait of Louise. But Madame recalls Raoul from\r\nLondon and shows him these proofs of Louise’s infidelity. Raoul,\r\ncrushed, challenges Saint-Aignan to a duel, which the king prevents,\r\nand Athos, furious, breaks his sword before the king. The king has\r\nD’Artagnan arrest Athos, and at the Bastile they encounter Aramis, who\r\nis paying Baisemeaux another visit. Raoul learns of Athos’s arrest,\r\nand with Porthos in tow, they effect a daring rescue, surprising the\r\ncarriage containing D’Artagnan and Athos as they leave the Bastile.\r\nAlthough quite impressive, the intrepid raid is in vain, as D’Artagnan\r\nhas already secured Athos’s pardon from the king. Instead, everybody\r\nswitches modes of transport; D’Artagnan and Porthos take the horses back\r\nto Paris, and Athos and Raoul take the carriage back to La Fere, where\r\nthey intend to reside permanently, as the king is now their sworn enemy,\r\nRaoul cannot bear to see Louise, and they have no more dealings in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nAramis, left alone with Baisemeaux, inquires the governor of the prison\r\nabout his loyalties, in particular to the Jesuits. The bishop reveals\r\nthat he is a confessor of the society, and invokes their regulations\r\nin order to obtain access to this mysterious prisoner who bears such a\r\nstriking resemblance to Louis XIV...\r\n\r\nAnd so Baisemeaux is conducting Aramis to the prisoner as the final\r\nsection of The Vicomte de Bragelonne and this final story of the\r\nD’Artagnan Romances opens. I have written a “Cast of Historical\r\nCharacters,” Etext 2760, that will enable curious readers to compare\r\npersonages in the novel with their historical counterparts. Also of\r\ninterest may be an essay Dumas wrote on the possible identity of the\r\nreal Man in the Iron Mask, which is Etext 2751.

The Prisoner.\r\n\r\nSince Aramis’s singular transformation into a confessor of the order,\r\nBaisemeaux was no longer the same man. Up to that period, the place\r\nwhich Aramis had held in the worthy governor’s estimation was that of\r\na prelate whom he respected and a friend to whom he owed a debt of\r\ngratitude; but now he felt himself an inferior, and that Aramis was\r\nhis master. He himself lighted a lantern, summoned a turnkey, and said,\r\nreturning to Aramis, “I am at your orders, monseigneur.” Aramis merely\r\nnodded his head, as much as to say, “Very good”; and signed to him with\r\nhis hand to lead the way. Baisemeaux advanced, and Aramis followed him.\r\nIt was a calm and lovely starlit night; the steps of three men resounded\r\non the flags of the terraces, and the clinking of the keys hanging from\r\nthe jailer’s girdle made itself heard up to the stories of the towers,\r\nas if to remind the prisoners that the liberty of earth was a luxury\r\nbeyond their reach. It might have been said that the alteration effected\r\nin Baisemeaux extended even to the prisoners. The turnkey, the same who,\r\non Aramis’s first arrival had shown himself so inquisitive and curious,\r\nwas now not only silent, but impassible. He held his head down, and\r\nseemed afraid to keep his ears open. In this wise they reached the\r\nbasement of the Bertaudiere, the two first stories of which were\r\nmounted silently and somewhat slowly; for Baisemeaux, though far from\r\ndisobeying, was far from exhibiting any eagerness to obey. On arriving\r\nat the door, Baisemeaux showed a disposition to enter the prisoner’s\r\nchamber; but Aramis, stopping him on the threshold, said, “The rules do\r\nnot allow the governor to hear the prisoner’s confession.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux bowed, and made way for Aramis, who took the lantern and\r\nentered; and then signed to them to close the door behind him. For\r\nan instant he remained standing, listening whether Baisemeaux and the\r\nturnkey had retired; but as soon as he was assured by the sound of their\r\ndescending footsteps that they had left the tower, he put the lantern\r\non the table and gazed around. On a bed of green serge, similar in all\r\nrespect to the other beds in the Bastile, save that it was newer, and\r\nunder curtains half-drawn, reposed a young man, to whom we have already\r\nonce before introduced Aramis. According to custom, the prisoner was\r\nwithout a light. At the hour of curfew, he was bound to extinguish his\r\nlamp, and we perceive how much he was favored, in being allowed to keep\r\nit burning even till then. Near the bed a large leathern armchair,\r\nwith twisted legs, sustained his clothes. A little table--without pens,\r\nbooks, paper, or ink--stood neglected in sadness near the window; while\r\nseveral plates, still unemptied, showed that the prisoner had scarcely\r\ntouched his evening meal. Aramis saw that the young man was stretched\r\nupon his bed, his face half concealed by his arms. The arrival of a\r\nvisitor did not caused any change of position; either he was waiting in\r\nexpectation, or was asleep. Aramis lighted the candle from the lantern,\r\npushed back the armchair, and approached the bed with an evident mixture\r\nof interest and respect. The young man raised his head. “What is it?”\r\n said he.\r\n\r\n“You desired a confessor?” replied Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Because you were ill?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Very ill?”\r\n\r\nThe young man gave Aramis a piercing glance, and answered, “I thank\r\nyou.” After a moment’s silence, “I have seen you before,” he continued.\r\nAramis bowed.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the scrutiny the prisoner had just made of the cold, crafty,\r\nand imperious character stamped upon the features of the bishop of\r\nVannes was little reassuring to one in his situation, for he added, “I\r\nam better.”\r\n\r\n“And so?” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Why, then--being better, I have no longer the same need of a confessor,\r\nI think.”\r\n\r\n“Not even of the hair-cloth, which the note you found in your bread\r\ninformed you of?”\r\n\r\nThe young man started; but before he had either assented or denied,\r\nAramis continued, “Not even of the ecclesiastic from whom you were to\r\nhear an important revelation?”\r\n\r\n“If it be so,” said the young man, sinking again on his pillow, “it is\r\ndifferent; I am listening.”\r\n\r\nAramis then looked at him more closely, and was struck with the easy\r\nmajesty of his mien, one which can never be acquired unless Heaven\r\nhas implanted it in the blood or heart. “Sit down, monsieur,” said the\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nAramis bowed and obeyed. “How does the Bastile agree with you?” asked\r\nthe bishop.\r\n\r\n“Very well.”\r\n\r\n“You do not suffer?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“You have nothing to regret?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Not even your liberty?”\r\n\r\n“What do you call liberty, monsieur?” asked the prisoner, with the tone\r\nof a man who is preparing for a struggle.\r\n\r\n“I call liberty, the flowers, the air, light, the stars, the happiness\r\nof going whithersoever the sinewy limbs of one-and-twenty chance to wish\r\nto carry you.”\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled, whether in resignation or contempt, it was\r\ndifficult to tell. “Look,” said he, “I have in that Japanese vase two\r\nroses gathered yesterday evening in the bud from the governor’s garden;\r\nthis morning they have blown and spread their vermilion chalice beneath\r\nmy gaze; with every opening petal they unfold the treasures of their\r\nperfumes, filling my chamber with a fragrance that embalms it. Look now\r\non these two roses; even among roses these are beautiful, and the rose\r\nis the most beautiful of flowers. Why, then, do you bid me desire other\r\nflowers when I possess the loveliest of all?”\r\n\r\nAramis gazed at the young man in surprise.\r\n\r\n“If _flowers_ constitute liberty,” sadly resumed the captive, “I am\r\nfree, for I possess them.”\r\n\r\n“But the air!” cried Aramis; “air is so necessary to life!”\r\n\r\n“Well, monsieur,” returned the prisoner; “draw near to the window; it is\r\nopen. Between high heaven and earth the wind whirls on its waftages\r\nof hail and lightning, exhales its torrid mist or breathes in gentle\r\nbreezes. It caresses my face. When mounted on the back of this armchair,\r\nwith my arm around the bars of the window to sustain myself, I fancy\r\nI am swimming the wide expanse before me.” The countenance of Aramis\r\ndarkened as the young man continued: “Light I have! what is better than\r\nlight? I have the sun, a friend who comes to visit me every day without\r\nthe permission of the governor or the jailer’s company. He comes in\r\nat the window, and traces in my room a square the shape of the window,\r\nwhich lights up the hangings of my bed and floods the very floor. This\r\nluminous square increases from ten o’clock till midday, and decreases\r\nfrom one till three slowly, as if, having hastened to my presence, it\r\nsorrowed at bidding me farewell. When its last ray disappears I have\r\nenjoyed its presence for five hours. Is not that sufficient? I have been\r\ntold that there are unhappy beings who dig in quarries, and laborers who\r\ntoil in mines, who never behold it at all.” Aramis wiped the drops from\r\nhis brow. “As to the stars which are so delightful to view,” continued\r\nthe young man, “they all resemble each other save in size and\r\nbrilliancy. I am a favored mortal, for if you had not lighted that\r\ncandle you would have been able to see the beautiful stars which I was\r\ngazing at from my couch before your arrival, whose silvery rays were\r\nstealing through my brain.”\r\n\r\nAramis lowered his head; he felt himself overwhelmed with the bitter\r\nflow of that sinister philosophy which is the religion of the captive.\r\n\r\n“So much, then, for the flowers, the air, the daylight, and the stars,”\r\n tranquilly continued the young man; “there remains but exercise. Do\r\nI not walk all day in the governor’s garden if it is fine--here if it\r\nrains? in the fresh air if it is warm; in perfect warmth, thanks to my\r\nwinter stove, if it be cold? Ah! monsieur, do you fancy,” continued the\r\nprisoner, not without bitterness, “that men have not done everything for\r\nme that a man can hope for or desire?”\r\n\r\n“Men!” said Aramis; “be it so; but it seems to me you are forgetting\r\nHeaven.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I have forgotten Heaven,” murmured the prisoner, with emotion;\r\n“but why do you mention it? Of what use is it to talk to a prisoner of\r\nHeaven?”\r\n\r\nAramis looked steadily at this singular youth, who possessed the\r\nresignation of a martyr with the smile of an atheist. “Is not Heaven in\r\neverything?” he murmured in a reproachful tone.\r\n\r\n“Say rather, at the end of everything,” answered the prisoner, firmly.\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” said Aramis; “but let us return to our starting-point.”\r\n\r\n“I ask nothing better,” returned the young man.\r\n\r\n“I am your confessor.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, you ought, as a penitent, to tell me the truth.”\r\n\r\n“My whole desire is to tell it you.”\r\n\r\n“Every prisoner has committed some crime for which he has been\r\nimprisoned. What crime, then, have you committed?”\r\n\r\n“You asked me the same question the first time you saw me,” returned the\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n“And then, as now you evaded giving me an answer.”\r\n\r\n“And what reason have you for thinking that I shall now reply to you?”\r\n\r\n“Because this time I am your confessor.”\r\n\r\n“Then if you wish me to tell what crime I have committed, explain to\r\nme in what a crime consists. For as my conscience does not accuse me, I\r\naver that I am not a criminal.”\r\n\r\n“We are often criminals in the sight of the great of the earth, not\r\nalone for having ourselves committed crimes, but because we know that\r\ncrimes have been committed.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner manifested the deepest attention.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I understand you,” he said, after a pause; “yes, you are right,\r\nmonsieur; it is very possible that, in such a light, I am a criminal in\r\nthe eyes of the great of the earth.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! then you know something,” said Aramis, who thought he had pierced\r\nnot merely through a defect in the harness, but through the joints of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“No, I am not aware of anything,” replied the young man; “but sometimes\r\nI think--and I say to myself--”\r\n\r\n“What do you say to yourself?”\r\n\r\n“That if I were to think but a little more deeply I should either go mad\r\nor I should divine a great deal.”\r\n\r\n“And then--and then?” said Aramis, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“Then I leave off.”\r\n\r\n“You leave off?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; my head becomes confused and my ideas melancholy; I feel _ennui_\r\novertaking me; I wish--”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know; but I do not like to give myself up to longing for things\r\nwhich I do not possess, when I am so happy with what I have.”\r\n\r\n“You are afraid of death?” said Aramis, with a slight uneasiness.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the young man, smiling.\r\n\r\nAramis felt the chill of that smile, and shuddered. “Oh, as you fear\r\ndeath, you know more about matters than you say,” he cried.\r\n\r\n“And you,” returned the prisoner, “who bade me to ask to see you;\r\nyou, who, when I did ask to see you, came here promising a world of\r\nconfidence; how is it that, nevertheless, it is you who are silent,\r\nleaving it for me to speak? Since, then, we both wear masks, either let\r\nus both retain them or put them aside together.”\r\n\r\nAramis felt the force and justice of the remark, saying to himself,\r\n“This is no ordinary man; I must be cautious.--Are you ambitious?”\r\n said he suddenly to the prisoner, aloud, without preparing him for the\r\nalteration.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by ambitious?” replied the youth.\r\n\r\n“Ambition,” replied Aramis, “is the feeling which prompts a man to\r\ndesire more--much more--than he possesses.”\r\n\r\n“I said that I was contented, monsieur; but, perhaps, I deceive myself.\r\nI am ignorant of the nature of ambition; but it is not impossible I may\r\nhave some. Tell me your mind; that is all I ask.”\r\n\r\n“An ambitious man,” said Aramis, “is one who covets that which is beyond\r\nhis station.”\r\n\r\n“I covet nothing beyond my station,” said the young man, with an\r\nassurance of manner which for the second time made the bishop of Vannes\r\ntremble.\r\n\r\nHe was silent. But to look at the kindling eye, the knitted brow, and\r\nthe reflective attitude of the captive, it was evident that he expected\r\nsomething more than silence,--a silence which Aramis now broke. “You\r\nlied the first time I saw you,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Lied!” cried the young man, starting up on his couch, with such a tone\r\nin his voice, and such a lightning in his eyes, that Aramis recoiled, in\r\nspite of himself.\r\n\r\n“I _should_ say,” returned Aramis, bowing, “you concealed from me what\r\nyou knew of your infancy.”\r\n\r\n“A man’s secrets are his own, monsieur,” retorted the prisoner, “and not\r\nat the mercy of the first chance-comer.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Aramis, bowing still lower than before, “‘tis true; pardon\r\nme, but to-day do I still occupy the place of a chance-comer? I beseech\r\nyou to reply, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\nThis title slightly disturbed the prisoner; but nevertheless he did not\r\nappear astonished that it was given him. “I do not know you, monsieur,”\r\n said he.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but if I dared, I would take your hand and kiss it!”\r\n\r\nThe young man seemed as if he were going to give Aramis his hand;\r\nbut the light which beamed in his eyes faded away, and he coldly and\r\ndistrustfully withdrew his hand again. “Kiss the hand of a prisoner,” he\r\nsaid, shaking his head, “to what purpose?”\r\n\r\n“Why did you tell me,” said Aramis, “that you were happy here? Why, that\r\nyou aspired to nothing? Why, in a word, by thus speaking, do you prevent\r\nme from being frank in my turn?”\r\n\r\nThe same light shone a third time in the young man’s eyes, but died\r\nineffectually away as before.\r\n\r\n“You distrust me,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“And why say you so, monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, for a very simple reason; if you know what you ought to know, you\r\nought to mistrust everybody.”\r\n\r\n“Then do not be astonished that I am mistrustful, since you suspect me\r\nof knowing what I do not know.”\r\n\r\nAramis was struck with admiration at this energetic resistance. “Oh,\r\nmonseigneur! you drive me to despair,” said he, striking the armchair\r\nwith his fist.\r\n\r\n“And, on my part, I do not comprehend you, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, try to understand me.” The prisoner looked fixedly at\r\nAramis.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes it seems to me,” said the latter, “that I have before me the\r\nman whom I seek, and then--”\r\n\r\n“And then your man disappears,--is it not so?” said the prisoner,\r\nsmiling. “So much the better.”\r\n\r\nAramis rose. “Certainly,” said he; “I have nothing further to say to a\r\nman who mistrusts me as you do.”\r\n\r\n“And I, monsieur,” said the prisoner, in the same tone, “have nothing\r\nto say to a man who will not understand that a prisoner ought to be\r\nmistrustful of everybody.”\r\n\r\n“Even of his old friends,” said Aramis. “Oh, monseigneur, you are _too_\r\nprudent!”\r\n\r\n“Of my old friends?--you one of my old friends,--you?”\r\n\r\n“Do you no longer remember,” said Aramis, “that you once saw, in the\r\nvillage where your early years were spent--”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the name of the village?” asked the prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Noisy-le-Sec, monseigneur,” answered Aramis, firmly.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said the young man, with an immovable aspect.\r\n\r\n“Stay, monseigneur,” said Aramis; “if you are positively resolved to\r\ncarry on this game, let us break off. I am here to tell you many things,\r\n‘tis true; but you must allow me to see that, on your side, you have\r\na desire to know them. Before revealing the important matters I still\r\nwithhold, be assured I am in need of some encouragement, if not candor;\r\na little sympathy, if not confidence. But you keep yourself intrenched\r\nin a pretended which paralyzes me. Oh, not for the reason you think;\r\nfor, ignorant as you may be, or indifferent as you feign to be, you are\r\nnone the less what you are, monseigneur, and there is nothing--nothing,\r\nmark me! which can cause you not to be so.”\r\n\r\n“I promise you,” replied the prisoner, “to hear you without impatience.\r\nOnly it appears to me that I have a right to repeat the question I have\r\nalready asked, ‘Who _are_ you?’”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember, fifteen or eighteen years ago, seeing at Noisy-le-Sec\r\na cavalier, accompanied by a lady in black silk, with flame-colored\r\nribbons in her hair?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the young man; “I once asked the name of this cavalier, and\r\nthey told me that he called himself the Abbe d’Herblay. I was astonished\r\nthat the abbe had so warlike an air, and they replied that there was\r\nnothing singular in that, seeing that he was one of Louis XIII.’s\r\nmusketeers.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Aramis, “that musketeer and abbe, afterwards bishop of\r\nVannes, is your confessor now.”\r\n\r\n“I know it; I recognized you.”\r\n\r\n“Then, monseigneur, if you know that, I must further add a fact of which\r\nyou are ignorant--that if the king were to know this evening of the\r\npresence of this musketeer, this abbe, this bishop, this confessor,\r\n_here_--he, who has risked everything to visit you, to-morrow would\r\nbehold the steely glitter of the executioner’s axe in a dungeon more\r\ngloomy, more obscure than yours.”\r\n\r\nWhile listening to these words, delivered with emphasis, the young\r\nman had raised himself on his couch, and was now gazing more and more\r\neagerly at Aramis.\r\n\r\nThe result of his scrutiny was that he appeared to derive some\r\nconfidence from it. “Yes,” he murmured, “I remember perfectly. The\r\nwoman of whom you speak came once with you, and twice afterwards with\r\nanother.” He hesitated.\r\n\r\n“With another, who came to see you every month--is it not so,\r\nmonseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know who this lady was?”\r\n\r\nThe light seemed ready to flash from the prisoner’s eyes. “I am aware\r\nthat she was one of the ladies of the court,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You remember that lady well, do you not?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my recollection can hardly be very confused on this head,” said the\r\nyoung prisoner. “I saw that lady once with a gentleman about forty-five\r\nyears old. I saw her once with you, and with the lady dressed in black.\r\nI have seen her twice since then with the same person. These four\r\npeople, with my master, and old Perronnette, my jailer, and the governor\r\nof the prison, are the only persons with whom I have ever spoken, and,\r\nindeed, almost the only persons I have ever seen.”\r\n\r\n“Then you were in prison?”\r\n\r\n“If I am a prisoner here, then I was comparatively free, although in\r\na very narrow sense--a house I never quitted, a garden surrounded with\r\nwalls I could not climb, these constituted my residence, but you know\r\nit, as you have been there. In a word, being accustomed to live within\r\nthese bounds, I never cared to leave them. And so you will understand,\r\nmonsieur, that having never seen anything of the world, I have nothing\r\nleft to care for; and therefore, if you relate anything, you will be\r\nobliged to explain each item to me as you go along.”\r\n\r\n“And I will do so,” said Aramis, bowing; “for it is my duty,\r\nmonseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, begin by telling me who was my tutor.”\r\n\r\n“A worthy and, above all, an honorable gentleman, monseigneur; fit guide\r\nfor both body and soul. Had you ever any reason to complain of him?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; quite the contrary. But this gentleman of yours often used to\r\ntell me that my father and mother were dead. Did he deceive me, or did\r\nhe speak the truth?”\r\n\r\n“He was compelled to comply with the orders given him.”\r\n\r\n“Then he lied?”\r\n\r\n“In one respect. Your father is dead.”\r\n\r\n“And my mother?”\r\n\r\n“She is dead _for you_.”\r\n\r\n“But then she lives for others, does she not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And I--and I, then” (the young man looked sharply at Aramis) “am\r\ncompelled to live in the obscurity of a prison?”\r\n\r\n“Alas! I fear so.”\r\n\r\n“And that because my presence in the world would lead to the revelation\r\nof a great secret?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, a very great secret.”\r\n\r\n“My enemy must indeed be powerful, to be able to shut up in the Bastile\r\na child such as I then was.”\r\n\r\n“He is.”\r\n\r\n“More powerful than my mother, then?”\r\n\r\n“And why do you ask that?”\r\n\r\n“Because my mother would have taken my part.”\r\n\r\nAramis hesitated. “Yes, monseigneur; more powerful than your mother.”\r\n\r\n“Seeing, then, that my nurse and preceptor were carried off, and that I,\r\nalso, was separated from them--either they were, or I am, very dangerous\r\nto my enemy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but you are alluding to a peril from which he freed himself, by\r\ncausing the nurse and preceptor to disappear,” answered Aramis, quietly.\r\n\r\n“Disappear!” cried the prisoner, “how did they disappear?”\r\n\r\n“In a very sure way,” answered Aramis--“they are dead.”\r\n\r\nThe young man turned pale, and passed his hand tremblingly over his\r\nface. “Poison?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Poison.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner reflected a moment. “My enemy must indeed have been very\r\ncruel, or hard beset by necessity, to assassinate those two innocent\r\npeople, my sole support; for the worthy gentleman and the poor nurse had\r\nnever harmed a living being.”\r\n\r\n“In your family, monseigneur, necessity is stern. And so it is necessity\r\nwhich compels me, to my great regret, to tell you that this gentleman\r\nand the unhappy lady have been assassinated.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you tell me nothing I am not aware of,” said the prisoner, knitting\r\nhis brows.\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“I suspected it.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the young man, supporting himself on his two elbows,\r\ndrew close to Aramis’s face, with such an expression of dignity, of\r\nself-command and of defiance even, that the bishop felt the electricity\r\nof enthusiasm strike in devouring flashes from that great heart of his,\r\ninto his brain of adamant.\r\n\r\n“Speak, monseigneur. I have already told you that by conversing with you\r\nI endanger my life. Little value as it has, I implore you to accept it\r\nas the ransom of your own.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” resumed the young man, “this is why I suspected they had killed\r\nmy nurse and my preceptor--”\r\n\r\n“Whom you used to call your father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; whom I called my father, but whose son I well knew I was not.”\r\n\r\n“Who caused you to suppose so?”\r\n\r\n“Just as you, monsieur, are too respectful for a friend, he was also too\r\nrespectful for a father.”\r\n\r\n“I, however,” said Aramis, “have no intention to disguise myself.”\r\n\r\nThe young man nodded assent and continued: “Undoubtedly, I was not\r\ndestined to perpetual seclusion,” said the prisoner; “and that which\r\nmakes me believe so, above all, now, is the care that was taken to\r\nrender me as accomplished a cavalier as possible. The gentleman attached\r\nto my person taught me everything he knew himself--mathematics, a little\r\ngeometry, astronomy, fencing and riding. Every morning I went through\r\nmilitary exercises, and practiced on horseback. Well, one morning during\r\nthe summer, it being very hot, I went to sleep in the hall. Nothing, up\r\nto that period, except the respect paid me, had enlightened me, or even\r\nroused my suspicions. I lived as children, as birds, as plants, as the\r\nair and the sun do. I had just turned my fifteenth year--”\r\n\r\n“This, then, is eight years ago?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, nearly; but I have ceased to reckon time.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me; but what did your tutor tell you, to encourage you to work?”\r\n\r\n“He used to say that a man was bound to make for himself, in the world,\r\nthat fortune which Heaven had refused him at his birth. He added that,\r\nbeing a poor, obscure orphan, I had no one but myself to look to; and\r\nthat nobody either did, or ever would, take any interest in me. I\r\nwas, then, in the hall I have spoken of, asleep from fatigue with long\r\nfencing. My preceptor was in his room on the first floor, just over\r\nme. Suddenly I heard him exclaim, and then he called: ‘Perronnette!\r\nPerronnette!’ It was my nurse whom he called.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know it,” said Aramis. “Continue, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Very likely she was in the garden; for my preceptor came hastily\r\ndownstairs. I rose, anxious at seeing him anxious. He opened the\r\ngarden-door, still crying out, ‘Perronnette! Perronnette!’ The windows\r\nof the hall looked into the court; the shutters were closed; but through\r\na chink in them I saw my tutor draw near a large well, which was almost\r\ndirectly under the windows of his study. He stooped over the brim,\r\nlooked into the well, and again cried out, and made wild and affrighted\r\ngestures. Where I was, I could not only see, but hear--and see and hear\r\nI did.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, I pray you,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Dame Perronnette came running up, hearing the governor’s cries. He went\r\nto meet her, took her by the arm, and drew her quickly towards the edge;\r\nafter which, as they both bent over it together, ‘Look, look,’ cried he,\r\n‘what a misfortune!’\r\n\r\n“‘Calm yourself, calm yourself,’ said Perronnette; ‘what is the matter?’\r\n\r\n“‘The letter!’ he exclaimed; ‘do you see that letter?’ pointing to the\r\nbottom of the well.\r\n\r\n“‘What letter?’ she cried.\r\n\r\n“‘The letter you see down there; the last letter from the queen.’\r\n\r\n“At this word I trembled. My tutor--he who passed for my father, he who\r\nwas continually recommending me modesty and humility--in correspondence\r\nwith the queen!\r\n\r\n“‘The queen’s last letter!’ cried Perronnette, without showing more\r\nastonishment than at seeing this letter at the bottom of the well; ‘but\r\nhow came it there?’\r\n\r\n“‘A chance, Dame Perronnette--a singular chance. I was entering my room,\r\nand on opening the door, the window, too, being open, a puff of air came\r\nsuddenly and carried off this paper--this letter of her majesty’s; I\r\ndarted after it, and gained the window just in time to see it flutter a\r\nmoment in the breeze and disappear down the well.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said Dame Perronnette; ‘and if the letter has fallen into the\r\nwell, ‘tis all the same as if it was burnt; and as the queen burns all\r\nher letters every time she comes--’\r\n\r\n“And so you see this lady who came every month was the queen,” said the\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\n“‘Doubtless, doubtless,’ continued the old gentleman; ‘but this letter\r\ncontained instructions--how can I follow them?’\r\n\r\n“‘Write immediately to her; give her a plain account of the accident,\r\nand the queen will no doubt write you another letter in place of this.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh! the queen would never believe the story,’ said the good gentleman,\r\nshaking his head; ‘she will imagine that I want to keep this letter\r\ninstead of giving it up like the rest, so as to have a hold over her.\r\nShe is so distrustful, and M. de Mazarin so--Yon devil of an Italian is\r\ncapable of having us poisoned at the first breath of suspicion.’”\r\n\r\nAramis almost imperceptibly smiled.\r\n\r\n“‘You know, Dame Perronnette, they are both so suspicious in all that\r\nconcerns Philippe.’\r\n\r\n“Philippe was the name they gave me,” said the prisoner.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, ‘tis no use hesitating,’ said Dame Perronnette, ‘somebody must\r\ngo down the well.’\r\n\r\n“‘Of course; so that the person who goes down may read the paper as he\r\nis coming up.’\r\n\r\n“‘But let us choose some villager who cannot read, and then you will be\r\nat ease.’\r\n\r\n“‘Granted; but will not any one who descends guess that a paper must be\r\nimportant for which we risk a man’s life? However, you have given me\r\nan idea, Dame Perronnette; somebody shall go down the well, but that\r\nsomebody shall be myself.’\r\n\r\n“But at this notion Dame Perronnette lamented and cried in such a\r\nmanner, and so implored the old nobleman, with tears in her eyes, that\r\nhe promised her to obtain a ladder long enough to reach down, while she\r\nwent in search of some stout-hearted youth, whom she was to persuade\r\nthat a jewel had fallen into the well, and that this jewel was wrapped\r\nin a paper. ‘And as paper,’ remarked my preceptor, ‘naturally unfolds\r\nin water, the young man would not be surprised at finding nothing, after\r\nall, but the letter wide open.’\r\n\r\n“‘But perhaps the writing will be already effaced by that time,’ said\r\nDame Perronnette.\r\n\r\n“‘No consequence, provided we secure the letter. On returning it to\r\nthe queen, she will see at once that we have not betrayed her; and\r\nconsequently, as we shall not rouse the distrust of Mazarin, we shall\r\nhave nothing to fear from him.’\r\n\r\n“Having come to this resolution, they parted. I pushed back the shutter,\r\nand, seeing that my tutor was about to re-enter, I threw myself on\r\nmy couch, in a confusion of brain caused by all I had just heard. My\r\ngovernor opened the door a few moments after, and thinking I was asleep\r\ngently closed it again. As soon as ever it was shut, I rose, and,\r\nlistening, heard the sound of retiring footsteps. Then I returned to the\r\nshutters, and saw my tutor and Dame Perronnette go out together. I was\r\nalone in the house. They had hardly closed the gate before I sprang from\r\nthe window and ran to the well. Then, just as my governor had leaned\r\nover, so leaned I. Something white and luminous glistened in the green\r\nand quivering silence of the water. The brilliant disk fascinated and\r\nallured me; my eyes became fixed, and I could hardly breathe. The well\r\nseemed to draw me downwards with its slimy mouth and icy breath; and I\r\nthought I read, at the bottom of the water, characters of fire traced\r\nupon the letter the queen had touched. Then, scarcely knowing what I was\r\nabout, and urged on by one of those instinctive impulses which drive\r\nmen to destruction, I lowered the cord from the windlass of the well to\r\nwithin about three feet of the water, leaving the bucket dangling, at\r\nthe same time taking infinite pains not to disturb that coveted\r\nletter, which was beginning to change its white tint for the hue of\r\nchrysoprase,--proof enough that it was sinking,--and then, with the\r\nrope weltering in my hands, slid down into the abyss. When I saw myself\r\nhanging over the dark pool, when I saw the sky lessening above my head,\r\na cold shudder came over me, a chill fear got the better of me, I was\r\nseized with giddiness, and the hair rose on my head; but my strong will\r\nstill reigned supreme over all the terror and disquietude. I gained\r\nthe water, and at once plunged into it, holding on by one hand, while I\r\nimmersed the other and seized the dear letter, which, alas! came in two\r\nin my grasp. I concealed the two fragments in my body-coat, and, helping\r\nmyself with my feet against the sides of the pit, and clinging on with\r\nmy hands, agile and vigorous as I was, and, above all, pressed for time,\r\nI regained the brink, drenching it as I touched it with the water that\r\nstreamed off me. I was no sooner out of the well with my prize, than I\r\nrushed into the sunlight, and took refuge in a kind of shrubbery at\r\nthe bottom of the garden. As I entered my hiding-place, the bell which\r\nresounded when the great gate was opened, rang. It was my preceptor come\r\nback again. I had but just time. I calculated that it would take ten\r\nminutes before he would gain my place of concealment, even if, guessing\r\nwhere I was, he came straight to it; and twenty if he were obliged to\r\nlook for me. But this was time enough to allow me to read the cherished\r\nletter, whose fragments I hastened to unite again. The writing was\r\nalready fading, but I managed to decipher it all.\r\n\r\n“And will you tell me what you read therein, monseigneur?” asked Aramis,\r\ndeeply interested.\r\n\r\n“Quite enough, monsieur, to see that my tutor was a man of noble rank,\r\nand that Perronnette, without being a lady of quality, was far better\r\nthan a servant; and also to perceived that I must myself be high-born,\r\nsince the queen, Anne of Austria, and Mazarin, the prime minister,\r\ncommended me so earnestly to their care.” Here the young man paused,\r\nquite overcome.\r\n\r\n“And what happened?” asked Aramis.\r\n\r\n“It happened, monsieur,” answered he, “that the workmen they had\r\nsummoned found nothing in the well, after the closest search; that my\r\ngovernor perceived that the brink was all watery; that I was not so\r\ndried by the sun as to prevent Dame Perronnette spying that my garments\r\nwere moist; and, lastly, that I was seized with a violent fever, owing\r\nto the chill and the excitement of my discovery, an attack of delirium\r\nsupervening, during which I related the whole adventure; so that, guided\r\nby my avowal, my governor found the pieces of the queen’s letter inside\r\nthe bolster where I had concealed them.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Aramis, “now I understand.”\r\n\r\n“Beyond this, all is conjecture. Doubtless the unfortunate lady and\r\ngentleman, not daring to keep the occurrence secret, wrote of all this\r\nto the queen and sent back the torn letter.”\r\n\r\n“After which,” said Aramis, “you were arrested and removed to the\r\nBastile.”\r\n\r\n“As you see.”\r\n\r\n“Your two attendants disappeared?”\r\n\r\n“Alas!”\r\n\r\n“Let us not take up our time with the dead, but see what can be done\r\nwith the living. You told me you were resigned.”\r\n\r\n“I repeat it.”\r\n\r\n“Without any desire for freedom?”\r\n\r\n“As I told you.”\r\n\r\n“Without ambition, sorrow, or thought?”\r\n\r\nThe young man made no answer.\r\n\r\n“Well,” asked Aramis, “why are you silent?”\r\n\r\n“I think I have spoken enough,” answered the prisoner, “and that now it\r\nis your turn. I am weary.”\r\n\r\nAramis gathered himself up, and a shade of deep solemnity spread itself\r\nover his countenance. It was evident that he had reached the crisis in\r\nthe part he had come to the prison to play. “One question,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“What is it? speak.”\r\n\r\n“In the house you inhabited there were neither looking-glasses nor\r\nmirrors?”\r\n\r\n“What are those two words, and what is their meaning?” asked the young\r\nman; “I have no sort of knowledge of them.”\r\n\r\n“They designate two pieces of furniture which reflect objects; so that,\r\nfor instance, you may see in them your own lineaments, as you see mine\r\nnow, with the naked eye.”\r\n\r\n“No; there was neither a glass nor a mirror in the house,” answered the\r\nyoung man.\r\n\r\nAramis looked round him. “Nor is there anything of the kind here,\r\neither,” he said; “they have again taken the same precaution.”\r\n\r\n“To what end?”\r\n\r\n“You will know directly. Now, you have told me that you were instructed\r\nin mathematics, astronomy, fencing, and riding; but you have not said a\r\nword about history.”\r\n\r\n“My tutor sometimes related to me the principal deeds of the king, St.\r\nLouis, King Francis I., and King Henry IV.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“Very nearly.”\r\n\r\n“This also was done by design, then; just as they deprived you of\r\nmirrors, which reflect the present, so they left you in ignorance of\r\nhistory, which reflects the past. Since your imprisonment, books have\r\nbeen forbidden you; so that you are unacquainted with a number of facts,\r\nby means of which you would be able to reconstruct the shattered mansion\r\nof your recollections and your hopes.”\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said the young man.\r\n\r\n“Listen, then; I will in a few words tell you what has passed in France\r\nduring the last twenty-three or twenty-four years; that is, from the\r\nprobable date of your birth; in a word, from the time that interests\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Say on.” And the young man resumed his serious and attentive attitude.\r\n\r\n“Do you know who was the son of Henry IV.?”\r\n\r\n“At least I know who his successor was.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“By means of a coin dated 1610, which bears the effigy of Henry IV.; and\r\nanother of 1612, bearing that of Louis XIII. So I presumed that,\r\nthere being only two years between the two dates, Louis was Henry’s\r\nsuccessor.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Aramis, “you know that the last reigning monarch was Louis\r\nXIII.?”\r\n\r\n“I do,” answered the youth, slightly reddening.\r\n\r\n“Well, he was a prince full of noble ideas and great projects, always,\r\nalas! deferred by the trouble of the times and the dread struggle that\r\nhis minister Richelieu had to maintain against the great nobles of\r\nFrance. The king himself was of a feeble character, and died young and\r\nunhappy.”\r\n\r\n“I know it.”\r\n\r\n“He had been long anxious about having a heir; a care which weighs\r\nheavily on princes, who desire to leave behind them more than one pledge\r\nthat their best thoughts and works will be continued.”\r\n\r\n“Did the king, then, die childless?” asked the prisoner, smiling.\r\n\r\n“No, but he was long without one, and for a long while thought he should\r\nbe the last of his race. This idea had reduced him to the depths of\r\ndespair, when suddenly, his wife, Anne of Austria--”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner trembled.\r\n\r\n“Did you know,” said Aramis, “that Louis XIII.’s wife was called Anne of\r\nAustria?”\r\n\r\n“Continue,” said the young man, without replying to the question.\r\n\r\n“When suddenly,” resumed Aramis, “the queen announced an interesting\r\nevent. There was great joy at the intelligence, and all prayed for her\r\nhappy delivery. On the 5th of September, 1638, she gave birth to a son.”\r\n\r\nHere Aramis looked at his companion, and thought he observed him turning\r\npale. “You are about to hear,” said Aramis, “an account which few indeed\r\ncould now avouch; for it refers to a secret which they imagined buried\r\nwith the dead, entombed in the abyss of the confessional.”\r\n\r\n“And you will tell me this secret?” broke in the youth.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Aramis, with unmistakable emphasis, “I do not know that I\r\nought to risk this secret by intrusting it to one who has no desire to\r\nquit the Bastile.”\r\n\r\n“I hear you, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“The queen, then, gave birth to a son. But while the court was rejoicing\r\nover the event, when the king had shown the new-born child to the\r\nnobility and people, and was sitting gayly down to table, to celebrate\r\nthe event, the queen, who was alone in her room, was again taken ill and\r\ngave birth to a second son.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said the prisoner, betraying a better acquaintance with affairs\r\nthan he had owned to, “I thought that Monsieur was only born in--”\r\n\r\nAramis raised his finger; “Permit me to continue,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner sighed impatiently, and paused.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Aramis, “the queen had a second son, whom Dame Perronnette,\r\nthe midwife, received in her arms.”\r\n\r\n“Dame Perronnette!” murmured the young man.\r\n\r\n“They ran at once to the banqueting-room, and whispered to the king what\r\nhad happened; he rose and quitted the table. But this time it was no\r\nlonger happiness that his face expressed, but something akin to terror.\r\nThe birth of twins changed into bitterness the joy to which that of an\r\nonly son had given rise, seeing that in France (a fact you are assuredly\r\nignorant of) it is the oldest of the king’s sons who succeeds his\r\nfather.”\r\n\r\n“I know it.”\r\n\r\n“And that the doctors and jurists assert that there is ground for\r\ndoubting whether the son that first makes his appearance is the elder by\r\nthe law of heaven and of nature.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner uttered a smothered cry, and became whiter than the\r\ncoverlet under which he hid himself.\r\n\r\n“Now you understand,” pursued Aramis, “that the king, who with so much\r\npleasure saw himself repeated in one, was in despair about two; fearing\r\nthat the second might dispute the first’s claim to seniority, which had\r\nbeen recognized only two hours before; and so this second son, relying\r\non party interests and caprices, might one day sow discord and engender\r\ncivil war throughout the kingdom; by these means destroying the very\r\ndynasty he should have strengthened.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I understand!--I understand!” murmured the young man.\r\n\r\n“Well,” continued Aramis; “this is what they relate, what they declare;\r\nthis is why one of the queen’s two sons, shamefully parted from his\r\nbrother, shamefully sequestered, is buried in profound obscurity; this\r\nis why that second son has disappeared, and so completely, that not a\r\nsoul in France, save his mother, is aware of his existence.”\r\n\r\n“Yes! his mother, who has cast him off,” cried the prisoner in a tone of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n“Except, also,” Aramis went on, “the lady in the black dress; and,\r\nfinally, excepting--”\r\n\r\n“Excepting yourself--is it not? You who come and relate all this; you,\r\nwho rouse in my soul curiosity, hatred, ambition, and, perhaps, even the\r\nthirst of vengeance; except you, monsieur, who, if you are the man to\r\nwhom I expect, whom the note I have received applies to, whom, in short,\r\nHeaven ought to send me, must possess about you--”\r\n\r\n“What?” asked Aramis.\r\n\r\n“A portrait of the king, Louis XIV., who at this moment reigns upon the\r\nthrone of France.”\r\n\r\n“Here is the portrait,” replied the bishop, handing the prisoner a\r\nminiature in enamel, on which Louis was depicted life-like, with a\r\nhandsome, lofty mien. The prisoner eagerly seized the portrait, and\r\ngazed at it with devouring eyes.\r\n\r\n“And now, monseigneur,” said Aramis, “here is a mirror.” Aramis left the\r\nprisoner time to recover his ideas.\r\n\r\n“So high!--so high!” murmured the young man, eagerly comparing the\r\nlikeness of Louis with his own countenance reflected in the glass.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of it?” at length said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“I think that I am lost,” replied the captive; “the king will never set\r\nme free.”\r\n\r\n“And I--I demand to know,” added the bishop, fixing his piercing eyes\r\nsignificantly upon the prisoner, “I demand to know which of these two is\r\nking; the one this miniature portrays, or whom the glass reflects?”\r\n\r\n“The king, monsieur,” sadly replied the young man, “is he who is on\r\nthe throne, who is not in prison; and who, on the other hand, can cause\r\nothers to be entombed there. Royalty means power; and you behold how\r\npowerless I am.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur,” answered Aramis, with a respect he had not yet\r\nmanifested, “the king, mark me, will, if you desire it, be the one that,\r\nquitting his dungeon, shall maintain himself upon the throne, on which\r\nhis friends will place him.”\r\n\r\n“Tempt me not, monsieur,” broke in the prisoner bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Be not weak, monseigneur,” persisted Aramis; “I have brought you all\r\nthe proofs of your birth; consult them; satisfy yourself that you are a\r\nking’s son; it is for _us_ to act.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; it is impossible.”\r\n\r\n“Unless, indeed,” resumed the bishop ironically, “it be the destiny of\r\nyour race, that the brothers excluded from the throne should be always\r\nprinces void of courage and honesty, as was your uncle, M. Gaston\r\nd’Orleans, who ten times conspired against his brother Louis XIII.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried the prince, astonished; “my uncle Gaston ‘conspired\r\nagainst his brother’; conspired to dethrone him?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, monseigneur; for no other reason. I tell you the truth.”\r\n\r\n“And he had friends--devoted friends?”\r\n\r\n“As much so as I am to you.”\r\n\r\n“And, after all, what did he do?--Failed!”\r\n\r\n“He failed, I admit; but always through his own fault; and, for the\r\nsake of purchasing--not his life--for the life of the king’s brother is\r\nsacred and inviolable--but his liberty, he sacrificed the lives of all\r\nhis friends, one after another. And so, at this day, he is a very\r\nblot on history, the detestation of a hundred noble families in this\r\nkingdom.”\r\n\r\n“I understand, monsieur; either by weakness or treachery, my uncle slew\r\nhis friends.”\r\n\r\n“By weakness; which, in princes, is always treachery.”\r\n\r\n“And cannot a man fail, then, from incapacity and ignorance? Do you\r\nreally believe it possible that a poor captive such as I, brought up,\r\nnot only at a distance from the court, but even from the world--do you\r\nbelieve it possible that such a one could assist those of his friends\r\nwho should attempt to serve him?” And as Aramis was about to reply, the\r\nyoung man suddenly cried out, with a violence which betrayed the temper\r\nof his blood, “We are speaking of friends; but how can _I_ have any\r\nfriends--I, whom no one knows; and have neither liberty, money, nor\r\ninfluence, to gain any?”\r\n\r\n“I fancy I had the honor to offer myself to your royal highness.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do not style me so, monsieur; ‘tis either treachery or cruelty. Bid\r\nme not think of aught beyond these prison-walls, which so grimly\r\nconfine me; let me again love, or, at least, submit to my slavery and my\r\nobscurity.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, monseigneur; if you again utter these desperate words--if,\r\nafter having received proof of your high birth, you still remain\r\npoor-spirited in body and soul, I will comply with your desire, I will\r\ndepart, and renounce forever the service of a master, to whom so eagerly\r\nI came to devote my assistance and my life!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” cried the prince, “would it not have been better for you to\r\nhave reflected, before telling me all that you have done, that you have\r\nbroken my heart forever?”\r\n\r\n“And so I desire to do, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“To talk to me about power, grandeur, eye, and to prate of thrones! Is\r\na prison the fit place? You wish to make me believe in splendor, and we\r\nare lying lost in night; you boast of glory, and we are smothering our\r\nwords in the curtains of this miserable bed; you give me glimpses of\r\npower absolute whilst I hear the footsteps of the every-watchful jailer\r\nin the corridor--that step which, after all, makes you tremble more than\r\nit does me. To render me somewhat less incredulous, free me from the\r\nBastile; let me breathe the fresh air; give me my spurs and trusty\r\nsword, then we shall begin to understand each other.”\r\n\r\n“It is precisely my intention to give you all this, monseigneur, and\r\nmore; only, do you desire it?”\r\n\r\n“A word more,” said the prince. “I know there are guards in every\r\ngallery, bolts to every door, cannon and soldiery at every barrier.\r\nHow will you overcome the sentries--spike the guns? How will you break\r\nthrough the bolts and bars?”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur,--how did you get the note which announced my arrival to\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“You can bribe a jailer for such a thing as a note.”\r\n\r\n“If we can corrupt one turnkey, we can corrupt ten.”\r\n\r\n“Well; I admit that it may be possible to release a poor captive from\r\nthe Bastile; possible so to conceal him that the king’s people shall\r\nnot again ensnare him; possible, in some unknown retreat, to sustain the\r\nunhappy wretch in some suitable manner.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur!” said Aramis, smiling.\r\n\r\n“I admit that, whoever would do this much for me, would seem more than\r\nmortal in my eyes; but as you tell me I am a prince, brother of the\r\nking, how can you restore me the rank and power which my mother and my\r\nbrother have deprived me of? And as, to effect this, I must pass a\r\nlife of war and hatred, how can you cause me to prevail in those\r\ncombats--render me invulnerable by my enemies? Ah! monsieur, reflect on\r\nall this; place me, to-morrow, in some dark cavern at a mountain’s base;\r\nyield me the delight of hearing in freedom sounds of the river, plain\r\nand valley, of beholding in freedom the sun of the blue heavens, or the\r\nstormy sky, and it is enough. Promise me no more than this, for, indeed,\r\nmore you cannot give, and it would be a crime to deceive me, since you\r\ncall yourself my friend.”\r\n\r\nAramis waited in silence. “Monseigneur,” he resumed, after a moment’s\r\nreflection, “I admire the firm, sound sense which dictates your words; I\r\nam happy to have discovered my monarch’s mind.”\r\n\r\n“Again, again! oh, God! for mercy’s sake,” cried the prince, pressing\r\nhis icy hands upon his clammy brow, “do not play with me! I have no need\r\nto be a king to be the happiest of men.”\r\n\r\n“But I, monseigneur, wish you to be a king for the good of humanity.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the prince, with fresh distrust inspired by the word; “ah!\r\nwith what, then, has humanity to reproach my brother?”\r\n\r\n“I forgot to say, monseigneur, that if you would allow me to guide you,\r\nand if you consent to become the most powerful monarch in Christendom,\r\nyou will have promoted the interests of all the friends whom I devote to\r\nthe success of your cause, and these friends are numerous.”\r\n\r\n“Numerous?”\r\n\r\n“Less numerous than powerful, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself.”\r\n\r\n“It is impossible; I will explain, I swear before Heaven, on that day\r\nthat I see you sitting on the throne of France.”\r\n\r\n“But my brother?”\r\n\r\n“You shall decree his fate. Do you pity him?”\r\n\r\n“Him, who leaves me to perish in a dungeon? No, no. For him I have no\r\npity!”\r\n\r\n“So much the better.”\r\n\r\n“He might have himself come to this prison, have taken me by the hand,\r\nand have said, ‘My brother, Heaven created us to love, not to contend\r\nwith one another. I come to you. A barbarous prejudice has condemned you\r\nto pass your days in obscurity, far from mankind, deprived of every joy.\r\nI will make you sit down beside me; I will buckle round your waist our\r\nfather’s sword. Will you take advantage of this reconciliation to put\r\ndown or restrain me? Will you employ that sword to spill my blood?’ ‘Oh!\r\nnever,’ I would have replied to him, ‘I look on you as my preserver,\r\nI will respect you as my master. You give me far more than Heaven\r\nbestowed; for through you I possess liberty and the privilege of loving\r\nand being loved in this world.’”\r\n\r\n“And you would have kept your word, monseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“On my life! While now--now that I have guilty ones to punish--”\r\n\r\n“In what manner, monseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“What do you say as to the resemblance that Heaven has given me to my\r\nbrother?”\r\n\r\n“I say that there was in that likeness a providential instruction which\r\nthe king ought to have heeded; I say that your mother committed a\r\ncrime in rendering those different in happiness and fortune whom nature\r\ncreated so startlingly alike, of her own flesh, and I conclude that the\r\nobject of punishment should be only to restore the equilibrium.”\r\n\r\n“By which you mean--”\r\n\r\n“That if I restore you to your place on your brother’s throne, he shall\r\ntake yours in prison.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! there’s such infinity of suffering in prison, especially it would\r\nbe so for one who has drunk so deeply of the cup of enjoyment.”\r\n\r\n“Your royal highness will always be free to act as you may desire; and\r\nif it seems good to you, after punishment, you will have it in your\r\npower to pardon.”\r\n\r\n“Good. And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, my prince.”\r\n\r\n“It is that I will hear nothing further from you till I am clear of the\r\nBastile.”\r\n\r\n“I was going to say to your highness that I should only have the\r\npleasure of seeing you once again.”\r\n\r\n“And when?”\r\n\r\n“The day when my prince leaves these gloomy walls.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens! how will you give me notice of it?”\r\n\r\n“By myself coming to fetch you.”\r\n\r\n“Yourself?”\r\n\r\n“My prince, do not leave this chamber save with me, or if in my absence\r\nyou are compelled to do so, remember that I am not concerned in it.”\r\n\r\n“And so I am not to speak a word of this to any one whatever, save to\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Save only to me.” Aramis bowed very low. The prince offered his hand.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” he said, in a tone that issued from his heart, “one word\r\nmore, my last. If you have sought me for my destruction; if you are only\r\na tool in the hands of my enemies; if from our conference, in which\r\nyou have sounded the depths of my mind, anything worse than captivity\r\nresult, that is to say, if death befall me, still receive my blessing,\r\nfor you will have ended my troubles and given me repose from the\r\ntormenting fever that has preyed on me for eight long, weary years.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, wait the results ere you judge me,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“I say that, in such a case, I bless and forgive you. If, on the other\r\nhand, you are come to restore me to that position in the sunshine of\r\nfortune and glory to which I was destined by Heaven; if by your means I\r\nam enabled to live in the memory of man, and confer luster on my race by\r\ndeeds of valor, or by solid benefits bestowed upon my people; if, from\r\nmy present depths of sorrow, aided by your generous hand, I raise myself\r\nto the very height of honor, then to you, whom I thank with blessings,\r\nto you will I offer half my power and my glory: though you would still\r\nbe but partly recompensed, and your share must always remain incomplete,\r\nsince I could not divide with you the happiness received at your hands.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur,” replied Aramis, moved by the pallor and excitement of\r\nthe young man, “the nobleness of your heart fills me with joy and\r\nadmiration. It is not you who will have to thank me, but rather the\r\nnation whom you will render happy, the posterity whose name you will\r\nmake glorious. Yes; I shall indeed have bestowed upon you more than\r\nlife, I shall have given you immortality.”\r\n\r\nThe prince offered his hand to Aramis, who sank upon his knee and kissed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“It is the first act of homage paid to our future king,” said he. “When\r\nI see you again, I shall say, ‘Good day, sire.’”\r\n\r\n“Till then,” said the young man, pressing his wan and wasted fingers\r\nover his heart,--“till then, no more dreams, no more strain on my\r\nlife--my heart would break! Oh, monsieur, how small is my prison--how\r\nlow the window--how narrow are the doors! To think that so much pride,\r\nsplendor, and happiness, should be able to enter in and to remain here!”\r\n\r\n“Your royal highness makes me proud,” said Aramis, “since you infer it\r\nis I who brought all this.” And he rapped immediately on the door.\r\nThe jailer came to open it with Baisemeaux, who, devoured by fear and\r\nuneasiness, was beginning, in spite of himself, to listen at the door.\r\nHappily, neither of the speakers had forgotten to smother his voice,\r\neven in the most passionate outbreaks.\r\n\r\n“What a confessor!” said the governor, forcing a laugh; “who would\r\nbelieve that a compulsory recluse, a man as though in the very jaws of\r\ndeath, could have committed crimes so numerous, and so long to tell of?”\r\n\r\nAramis made no reply. He was eager to leave the Bastile, where the\r\nsecret which overwhelmed him seemed to double the weight of the walls.\r\nAs soon as they reached Baisemeaux’s quarters, “Let us proceed to\r\nbusiness, my dear governor,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” replied Baisemeaux.\r\n\r\n“You have to ask me for my receipt for one hundred and fifty thousand\r\nlivres,” said the bishop.\r\n\r\n“And to pay over the first third of the sum,” added the poor governor,\r\nwith a sigh, taking three steps towards his iron strong-box.\r\n\r\n“Here is the receipt,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“And here is the money,” returned Baisemeaux, with a threefold sigh.\r\n\r\n“The order instructed me only to give a receipt; it said nothing about\r\nreceiving the money,” rejoined Aramis. “Adieu, monsieur le governeur!”\r\n\r\nAnd he departed, leaving Baisemeaux almost more than stifled with\r\njoy and surprise at this regal present so liberally bestowed by the\r\nconfessor extraordinary to the Bastile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II. How Mouston Had Become Fatter without Giving Porthos Notice\r\nThereof, and of the Troubles Which Consequently Befell that Worthy\r\nGentleman.\r\n\r\nSince the departure of Athos for Blois, Porthos and D’Artagnan were\r\nseldom together. One was occupied with harassing duties for the king,\r\nthe other had been making many purchases of furniture which he intended\r\nto forward to his estate, and by aid of which he hoped to establish in\r\nhis various residences something of the courtly luxury he had witnessed\r\nin all its dazzling brightness in his majesty’s society. D’Artagnan,\r\never faithful, one morning during an interval of service thought about\r\nPorthos, and being uneasy at not having heard anything of him for a\r\nfortnight, directed his steps towards his hotel, and pounced upon him\r\njust as he was getting up. The worthy baron had a pensive--nay,\r\nmore than pensive--melancholy air. He was sitting on his bed, only\r\nhalf-dressed, and with legs dangling over the edge, contemplating a host\r\nof garments, which with their fringes, lace, embroidery, and slashes\r\nof ill-assorted hues, were strewed all over the floor. Porthos, sad and\r\nreflective as La Fontaine’s hare, did not observe D’Artagnan’s entrance,\r\nwhich was, moreover, screened at this moment by M. Mouston, whose\r\npersonal corpulency, quite enough at any time to hide one man from\r\nanother, was effectually doubled by a scarlet coat which the intendant\r\nwas holding up for his master’s inspection, by the sleeves, that he\r\nmight the better see it all over. D’Artagnan stopped at the threshold\r\nand looked in at the pensive Porthos and then, as the sight of the\r\ninnumerable garments strewing the floor caused mighty sighs to heave the\r\nbosom of that excellent gentleman, D’Artagnan thought it time to put\r\nan end to these dismal reflections, and coughed by way of announcing\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Porthos, whose countenance brightened with joy; “ah! ah!\r\nHere is D’Artagnan. I shall then get hold of an idea!”\r\n\r\nAt these words Mouston, doubting what was going on behind him, got out\r\nof the way, smiling kindly at the friend of his master, who thus\r\nfound himself freed from the material obstacle which had prevented\r\nhis reaching D’Artagnan. Porthos made his sturdy knees crack again in\r\nrising, and crossing the room in two strides, found himself face to face\r\nwith his friend, whom he folded to his breast with a force of affection\r\nthat seemed to increase with every day. “Ah!” he repeated, “you are\r\nalways welcome, dear friend; but just now you are more welcome than\r\never.”\r\n\r\n“But you seem to have the megrims here!” exclaimed D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nPorthos replied by a look expressive of dejection. “Well, then, tell me\r\nall about it, Porthos, my friend, unless it is a secret.”\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” returned Porthos, “you know I have no secrets from\r\nyou. This, then, is what saddens me.”\r\n\r\n“Wait a minute, Porthos; let me first get rid of all this litter of\r\nsatin and velvet!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, never mind,” said Porthos, contemptuously; “it is all trash.”\r\n\r\n“Trash, Porthos! Cloth at twenty-five livres an ell! gorgeous satin!\r\nregal velvet!”\r\n\r\n“Then you think these clothes are--”\r\n\r\n“Splendid, Porthos, splendid! I’ll wager that you alone in France have\r\nso many; and suppose you never had any more made, and were to live to\r\nbe a hundred years of age, which wouldn’t astonish me in the very least,\r\nyou could still wear a new dress the day of your death, without being\r\nobliged to see the nose of a single tailor from now till then.”\r\n\r\nPorthos shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Come, my friend,” said D’Artagnan, “this unnatural melancholy in you\r\nfrightens me. My dear Porthos, pray get it out, then. And the sooner the\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend, so I will: if, indeed, it is possible.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you have received bad news from Bracieux?”\r\n\r\n“No: they have felled the wood, and it has yielded a third more than the\r\nestimate.”\r\n\r\n“Then there has been a falling-off in the pools of Pierrefonds?”\r\n\r\n“No, my friend: they have been fished, and there is enough left to stock\r\nall the pools in the neighborhood.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps your estate at Vallon has been destroyed by an earthquake?”\r\n\r\n“No, my friend; on the contrary, the ground was struck with lightning\r\na hundred paces from the chateau, and a fountain sprung up in a place\r\nentirely destitute of water.”\r\n\r\n“What in the world _is_ the matter, then?”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, I have received an invitation for the _fete_ at Vaux,”\r\n said Porthos, with a lugubrious expression.\r\n\r\n“Well! do you complain of that? The king has caused a hundred mortal\r\nheart-burnings among the courtiers by refusing invitations. And so, my\r\ndear friend, you are really going to Vaux?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I am!”\r\n\r\n“You will see a magnificent sight.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! I doubt it, though.”\r\n\r\n“Everything that is grand in France will be brought together there!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried Porthos, tearing out a lock of hair in his despair.\r\n\r\n“Eh! good heavens, are you ill?” cried D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“I am as firm as the Pont-Neuf! It isn’t that.”\r\n\r\n“But what is it, then?”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis that I have no clothes!”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan stood petrified. “No clothes! Porthos, no clothes!” he cried,\r\n“when I see at least fifty suits on the floor.”\r\n\r\n“Fifty, truly; but not one which fits me!”\r\n\r\n“What? not one that fits you? But are you not measured, then, when you\r\ngive an order?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure he is,” answered Mouston; “but unfortunately _I_ have gotten\r\nstouter!”\r\n\r\n“What! _you_ stouter!”\r\n\r\n“So much so that I am now bigger than the baron. Would you believe it,\r\nmonsieur?”\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu!_ it seems to me that is quite evident.”\r\n\r\n“Do you see, stupid?” said Porthos, “that is quite evident!”\r\n\r\n“Be still, my dear Porthos,” resumed D’Artagnan, becoming slightly\r\nimpatient, “I don’t understand why your clothes should not fit you,\r\nbecause Mouston has grown stouter.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to explain it,” said Porthos. “You remember having related\r\nto me the story of the Roman general Antony, who had always seven wild\r\nboars kept roasting, each cooked up to a different point; so that he\r\nmight be able to have his dinner at any time of the day he chose to ask\r\nfor it. Well, then, I resolved, as at any time I might be invited to\r\ncourt to spend a week, I resolved to have always seven suits ready for\r\nthe occasion.”\r\n\r\n“Capitally reasoned, Porthos--only a man must have a fortune like yours\r\nto gratify such whims. Without counting the time lost in being measured,\r\nthe fashions are always changing.”\r\n\r\n“That is exactly the point,” said Porthos, “in regard to which I\r\nflattered myself I had hit on a very ingenious device.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me what it is; for I don’t doubt your genius.”\r\n\r\n“You remember what Mouston once was, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; when he used to call himself Mousqueton.”\r\n\r\n“And you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?”\r\n\r\n“No, not exactly. I beg your pardon, my good Mouston.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you are not in fault, monsieur,” said Mouston, graciously. “You\r\nwere in Paris, and as for us, we were at Pierrefonds.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, my dear Porthos; there was a time when Mouston began to\r\ngrow fat. Is that what you wished to say?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend; and I greatly rejoice over the period.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I believe you do,” exclaimed D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“You understand,” continued Porthos, “what a world of trouble it spared\r\nfor me.”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t--by any means.”\r\n\r\n“Look here, my friend. In the first place, as you have said, to be\r\nmeasured is a loss of time, even though it occur only once a fortnight.\r\nAnd then, one may be travelling; and then you wish to have seven suits\r\nalways with you. In short, I have a horror of letting any one take my\r\nmeasure. Confound it! either one is a nobleman or not. To be scrutinized\r\nand scanned by a fellow who completely analyzes you, by inch and\r\nline--‘tis degrading! Here, they find you too hollow; there, too\r\nprominent. They recognize your strong and weak points. See, now, when we\r\nleave the measurer’s hands, we are like those strongholds whose angles\r\nand different thicknesses have been ascertained by a spy.”\r\n\r\n“In truth, my dear Porthos, you possess ideas entirely original.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you see when a man is an engineer--”\r\n\r\n“And has fortified Belle-Isle--‘tis natural, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I had an idea, which would doubtless have proved a good one, but\r\nfor Mouston’s carelessness.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan glanced at Mouston, who replied by a slight movement of his\r\nbody, as if to say, “You will see whether I am at all to blame in all\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\n“I congratulated myself, then,” resumed Porthos, “at seeing Mouston get\r\nfat; and I did all I could, by means of substantial feeding, to make him\r\nstout--always in the hope that he would come to equal myself in girth,\r\nand could then be measured in my stead.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried D’Artagnan. “I see--that spared you both time and\r\nhumiliation.”\r\n\r\n“Consider my joy when, after a year and a half’s judicious feeding--for\r\nI used to feed him up myself--the fellow--”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I lent a good hand myself, monsieur,” said Mouston, humbly.\r\n\r\n“That’s true. Consider my joy when, one morning, I perceived Mouston was\r\nobliged to squeeze in, as I once did myself, to get through the little\r\nsecret door that those fools of architects had made in the chamber of\r\nthe late Madame du Vallon, in the chateau of Pierrefonds. And, by the\r\nway, about that door, my friend, I should like to ask you, who know\r\neverything, why these wretches of architects, who ought to have the\r\ncompasses run into them, just to remind them, came to make doorways\r\nthrough which nobody but thin people can pass?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, those doors,” answered D’Artagnan, “were meant for gallants, and\r\nthey have generally slight and slender figures.”\r\n\r\n“Madame du Vallon had no gallant!” answered Porthos, majestically.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly true, my friend,” resumed D’Artagnan; “but the architects\r\nwere probably making their calculations on a basis of the probability of\r\nyour marrying again.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that is possible,” said Porthos. “And now I have received an\r\nexplanation of how it is that doorways are made too narrow, let us\r\nreturn to the subject of Mouston’s fatness. But see how the two things\r\napply to each other. I have always noticed that people’s ideas run\r\nparallel. And so, observe this phenomenon, D’Artagnan. I was talking to\r\nyou of Mouston, who is fat, and it led us on to Madame du Vallon--”\r\n\r\n“Who was thin?”\r\n\r\n“Hum! Is it not marvelous?”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend, a _savant_ of my acquaintance, M. Costar, has made the\r\nsame observation as you have, and he calls the process by some Greek\r\nname which I forget.”\r\n\r\n“What! my remark is not then original?” cried Porthos, astounded. “I\r\nthought I was the discoverer.”\r\n\r\n“My friend, the fact was known before Aristotle’s days--that is to say,\r\nnearly two thousand years ago.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, ‘tis no less true,” said Porthos, delighted at the idea of\r\nhaving jumped to a conclusion so closely in agreement with the greatest\r\nsages of antiquity.\r\n\r\n“Wonderfully--but suppose we return to Mouston. It seems to me, we have\r\nleft him fattening under our very eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur,” said Mouston.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Porthos, “Mouston fattened so well, that he gratified all\r\nmy hopes, by reaching my standard; a fact of which I was well able to\r\nconvince myself, by seeing the rascal, one day, in a waistcoat of mine,\r\nwhich he had turned into a coat--a waistcoat, the mere embroidery of\r\nwhich was worth a hundred pistoles.”\r\n\r\n“‘Twas only to try it on, monsieur,” said Mouston.\r\n\r\n“From that moment I determined to put Mouston in communication with my\r\ntailors, and to have him measured instead of myself.”\r\n\r\n“A capital idea, Porthos; but Mouston is a foot and a half shorter than\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly! They measured him down to the ground, and the end of the skirt\r\ncame just below my knee.”\r\n\r\n“What a marvelous man you are, Porthos! Such a thing could happen only\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes; pay your compliments; you have ample grounds to go upon. It\r\nwas exactly at that time--that is to say, nearly two years and a half\r\nago--that I set out for Belle-Isle, instructing Mouston (so as always\r\nto have, in every event, a pattern of every fashion) to have a coat made\r\nfor himself every month.”\r\n\r\n“And did Mouston neglect complying with your instructions? Ah! that was\r\nanything but right, Mouston.”\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur, quite the contrary; quite the contrary!”\r\n\r\n“No, he never forgot to have his coats made; but he forgot to inform me\r\nthat he had got stouter!”\r\n\r\n“But it was not my fault, monsieur! your tailor never told me.”\r\n\r\n“And this to such an extent, monsieur,” continued Porthos, “that the\r\nfellow in two years has gained eighteen inches in girth, and so my last\r\ndozen coats are all too large, from a foot to a foot and a half.”\r\n\r\n“But the rest; those which were made when you were of the same size?”\r\n\r\n“They are no longer the fashion, my dear friend. Were I to put them on,\r\nI should look like a fresh arrival from Siam; and as though I had been\r\ntwo years away from court.”\r\n\r\n“I understand your difficulty. You have how many new suits?\r\nnine? thirty-six? and yet not one to wear. Well, you must have a\r\nthirty-seventh made, and give the thirty-six to Mouston.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! monsieur!” said Mouston, with a gratified air. “The truth is, that\r\nmonsieur has always been very generous to me.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to insinuate that I hadn’t that idea, or that I was\r\ndeterred by the expense? But it wants only two days to the _fete_; I\r\nreceived the invitation yesterday; made Mouston post hither with my\r\nwardrobe, and only this morning discovered my misfortune; and from now\r\ntill the day after to-morrow, there isn’t a single fashionable tailor\r\nwho will undertake to make me a suit.”\r\n\r\n“That is to say, one covered all over with gold, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“I wish it so! undoubtedly, all over.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we shall manage it. You won’t leave for three days. The invitations\r\nare for Wednesday, and this is only Sunday morning.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis true; but Aramis has strongly advised me to be at Vaux twenty-four\r\nhours beforehand.”\r\n\r\n“How, Aramis?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it was Aramis who brought me the invitation.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! to be sure, I see. You are invited on the part of M. Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“By no means! by the king, dear friend. The letter bears the following\r\nas large as life: ‘M. le Baron du Vallon is informed that the king has\r\ncondescended to place him on the invitation list--’”\r\n\r\n“Very good; but you leave with M. Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“And when I think,” cried Porthos, stamping on the floor, “when I think\r\nI shall have no clothes, I am ready to burst with rage! I should like to\r\nstrangle somebody or smash something!”\r\n\r\n“Neither strangle anybody nor smash anything, Porthos; I will manage it\r\nall; put on one of your thirty-six suits, and come with me to a tailor.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! my agent has seen them all this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Even M. Percerin?”\r\n\r\n“Who is M. Percerin?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! only the king’s tailor!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, ah, yes,” said Porthos, who wished to appear to know the king’s\r\ntailor, but now heard his name mentioned for the first time; “to M.\r\nPercerin’s, by Jove! I was afraid he would be too busy.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless he will be; but be at ease, Porthos; he will do for me\r\nwhat he wouldn’t do for another. Only you must allow yourself to be\r\nmeasured!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Porthos, with a sigh, “‘tis vexatious, but what would you\r\nhave me do?”\r\n\r\n“Do? As others do; as the king does.”\r\n\r\n“What! do they measure the king, too? does he put up with it?”\r\n\r\n“The king is a beau, my good friend, and so are you, too, whatever you\r\nmay say about it.”\r\n\r\nPorthos smiled triumphantly. “Let us go to the king’s tailor,” he said;\r\n“and since he measures the king, I think, by my faith, I may do worse\r\nthan allow him to measure _me!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III. Who Messire Jean Percerin Was.\r\n\r\nThe king’s tailor, Messire Jean Percerin, occupied a rather large house\r\nin the Rue St. Honore, near the Rue de l’Arbre Sec. He was a man\r\nof great taste in elegant stuffs, embroideries, and velvets, being\r\nhereditary tailor to the king. The preferment of his house reached as\r\nfar back as the time of Charles IX.; from whose reign dated, as we know,\r\nfancy in _bravery_ difficult enough to gratify. The Percerin of that\r\nperiod was a Huguenot, like Ambrose Pare, and had been spared by the\r\nQueen of Navarre, the beautiful Margot, as they used to write and say,\r\ntoo, in those days; because, in sooth, he was the only one who could\r\nmake for her those wonderful riding-habits which she so loved to wear,\r\nseeing that they were marvelously well suited to hide certain anatomical\r\ndefects, which the Queen of Navarre used very studiously to conceal.\r\nPercerin being saved, made, out of gratitude, some beautiful black\r\nbodices, very inexpensively indeed, for Queen Catherine, who ended by\r\nbeing pleased at the preservation of a Huguenot people, on whom she had\r\nlong looked with detestation. But Percerin was a very prudent man;\r\nand having heard it said that there was no more dangerous sign for a\r\nProtestant than to be smiled up on by Catherine, and having observed\r\nthat her smiles were more frequent than usual, he speedily turned\r\nCatholic with all his family; and having thus become irreproachable,\r\nattained the lofty position of master tailor to the Crown of France.\r\nUnder Henry III., gay king as he was, this position was as grand as the\r\nheight of one of the loftiest peaks of the Cordilleras. Now Percerin had\r\nbeen a clever man all his life, and by way of keeping up his reputation\r\nbeyond the grave, took very good care not to make a bad death of it, and\r\nso contrived to die very skillfully; and that at the very moment he felt\r\nhis powers of invention declining. He left a son and a daughter, both\r\nworthy of the name they were called upon to bear; the son, a cutter as\r\nunerring and exact as the square rule; the daughter, apt at embroidery,\r\nand at designing ornaments. The marriage of Henry IV. and Marie de\r\nMedici, and the exquisite court-mourning for the afore-mentioned queen,\r\ntogether with a few words let fall by M. de Bassompiere, king of the\r\n_beaux_ of the period, made the fortune of the second generation of\r\nPercerins. M. Concino Concini, and his wife Galligai, who subsequently\r\nshone at the French court, sought to Italianize the fashion, and\r\nintroduced some Florentine tailors; but Percerin, touched to the\r\nquick in his patriotism and his self-esteem, entirely defeated these\r\nforeigners, and that so well that Concino was the first to give up his\r\ncompatriots, and held the French tailor in such esteem that he would\r\nnever employ any other, and thus wore a doublet of his on the very day\r\nthat Vitry blew out his brains with a pistol at the Pont du Louvre.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was a doublet issuing from M. Percerin’s workshop, which the\r\nParisians rejoiced in hacking into so many pieces with the living human\r\nbody it contained. Notwithstanding the favor Concino Concini had shown\r\nPercerin, the king, Louis XIII., had the generosity to bear no malice to\r\nhis tailor, and to retain him in his service. At the time that Louis the\r\nJust afforded this great example of equity, Percerin had brought up two\r\nsons, one of whom made his _debut_ at the marriage of Anne of Austria,\r\ninvented that admirable Spanish costume, in which Richelieu danced a\r\nsaraband, made the costumes for the tragedy of “Mirame,” and stitched\r\non to Buckingham’s mantle those famous pearls which were destined to\r\nbe scattered about the pavements of the Louvre. A man becomes easily\r\nnotable who has made the dresses of a Duke of Buckingham, a M. de\r\nCinq-Mars, a Mademoiselle Ninon, a M. de Beaufort, and a Marion de\r\nLorme. And thus Percerin the third had attained the summit of his glory\r\nwhen his father died. This same Percerin III., old, famous and wealthy,\r\nyet further dressed Louis XIV.; and having no son, which was a great\r\ncause of sorrow to him, seeing that with himself his dynasty would end,\r\nhe had brought up several hopeful pupils. He possessed a carriage,\r\na country house, men-servants the tallest in Paris; and by special\r\nauthority from Louis XIV., a pack of hounds. He worked for MM. de Lyonne\r\nand Letellier, under a sort of patronage; but politic man as he was, and\r\nversed in state secrets, he never succeeded in fitting M. Colbert. This\r\nis beyond explanation; it is a matter for guessing or for intuition.\r\nGreat geniuses of every kind live on unseen, intangible ideas; they act\r\nwithout themselves knowing why. The great Percerin (for, contrary to\r\nthe rule of dynasties, it was, above all, the last of the Percerins who\r\ndeserved the name of Great), the great Percerin was inspired when he cut\r\na robe for the queen, or a coat for the king; he could mount a mantle\r\nfor Monsieur, the clock of a stocking for Madame; but, in spite of his\r\nsupreme talent, he could never hit off anything approaching a creditable\r\nfit for M. Colbert. “That man,” he used often to say, “is beyond my art;\r\nmy needle can never dot him down.” We need scarcely say that Percerin\r\nwas M. Fouquet’s tailor, and that the superintendent highly esteemed\r\nhim. M. Percerin was nearly eighty years old, nevertheless still fresh,\r\nand at the same time so dry, the courtiers used to say, that he was\r\npositively brittle. His renown and his fortune were great enough for\r\nM. le Prince, that king of fops, to take his arm when talking over the\r\nfashions; and for those least eager to pay never to dare to leave their\r\naccounts in arrear with him; for Master Percerin would for the first\r\ntime make clothes upon credit, but the second never, unless paid for the\r\nformer order.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see at once that a tailor of such renown, instead of\r\nrunning after customers, made difficulties about obliging any fresh\r\nones. And so Percerin declined to fit _bourgeois_, or those who had but\r\nrecently obtained patents of nobility. A story used to circulate that\r\neven M. de Mazarin, in exchange for Percerin supplying him with a full\r\nsuit of ceremonial vestments as cardinal, one fine day slipped letters\r\nof nobility into his pocket.\r\n\r\nIt was to the house of this grand llama of tailors that D’Artagnan\r\ntook the despairing Porthos; who, as they were going along, said to his\r\nfriend, “Take care, my good D’Artagnan, not to compromise the dignity\r\nof a man such as I am with the arrogance of this Percerin, who will, I\r\nexpect, be very impertinent; for I give you notice, my friend, that if\r\nhe is wanting in respect I will infallibly chastise him.”\r\n\r\n“Presented by me,” replied D’Artagnan, “you have nothing to fear, even\r\nthough you were what you are not.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! ‘tis because--”\r\n\r\n“What? Have you anything against Percerin, Porthos?”\r\n\r\n“I think that I once sent Mouston to a fellow of that name.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“The fellow refused to supply me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a misunderstanding, no doubt, which it will be now exceedingly easy\r\nto set right. Mouston must have made a mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“He has confused the names.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly. That rascal Mouston never can remember names.”\r\n\r\n“I will take it all upon myself.”\r\n\r\n“Very good.”\r\n\r\n“Stop the carriage, Porthos; here we are.”\r\n\r\n“Here! how here? We are at the Halles; and you told me the house was at\r\nthe corner of the Rue de l’Arbre Sec.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis true, but look.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I do look, and I see--”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ that we are at the Halles!”\r\n\r\n“You do not, I suppose, want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the\r\ncarriage in front of us?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Nor the carriage in front of us to mount on top of the one in front of\r\nit. Nor that the second should be driven over the roofs of the thirty or\r\nforty others which have arrived before us.”\r\n\r\n“No, you are right, indeed. What a number of people! And what are they\r\nall about?”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis very simple. They are waiting their turn.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! Have the comedians of the Hotel de Bourgogne shifted their\r\nquarters?”\r\n\r\n“No; their turn to obtain an entrance to M. Percerin’s house.”\r\n\r\n“And we are going to wait too?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, we shall show ourselves prompter and not so proud.”\r\n\r\n“What are we to do, then?”\r\n\r\n“Get down, pass through the footmen and lackeys, and enter the tailor’s\r\nhouse, which I will answer for our doing, if you go first.”\r\n\r\n“Come along, then,” said Porthos.\r\n\r\nThey accordingly alighted and made their way on foot towards the\r\nestablishment. The cause of the confusion was that M. Percerin’s doors\r\nwere closed, while a servant, standing before them, was explaining to\r\nthe illustrious customers of the illustrious tailor that just then M.\r\nPercerin could not receive anybody. It was bruited about outside still,\r\non the authority of what the great lackey had told some great noble whom\r\nhe favored, in confidence, that M. Percerin was engaged on five costumes\r\nfor the king, and that, owing to the urgency of the case, he was\r\nmeditating in his office on the ornaments, colors, and cut of these five\r\nsuits. Some, contented with this reason, went away again, contented\r\nto repeat the tale to others, but others, more tenacious, insisted\r\non having the doors opened, and among these last three Blue Ribbons,\r\nintended to take parts in a ballet, which would inevitably fail unless\r\nthe said three had their costumes shaped by the very hand of the great\r\nPercerin himself. D’Artagnan, pushing on Porthos, who scattered the\r\ngroups of people right and left, succeeded in gaining the counter,\r\nbehind which the journeyman tailors were doing their best to answer\r\nqueries. (We forgot to mention that at the door they wanted to put\r\noff Porthos like the rest, but D’Artagnan, showing himself, pronounced\r\nmerely these words, “The king’s order,” and was let in with his friend.)\r\nThe poor fellows had enough to do, and did their best, to reply to the\r\ndemands of the customers in the absence of their master, leaving\r\noff drawing a stitch to knit a sentence; and when wounded pride, or\r\ndisappointed expectation, brought down upon them too cutting a rebuke,\r\nhe who was attacked made a dive and disappeared under the counter.\r\nThe line of discontented lords formed a truly remarkable picture. Our\r\ncaptain of musketeers, a man of sure and rapid observation, took it all\r\nin at a glance; and having run over the groups, his eye rested on a man\r\nin front of him. This man, seated upon a stool, scarcely showed his head\r\nabove the counter that sheltered him. He was about forty years of age,\r\nwith a melancholy aspect, pale face, and soft luminous eyes. He was\r\nlooking at D’Artagnan and the rest, with his chin resting upon his hand,\r\nlike a calm and inquiring amateur. Only on perceiving, and doubtless\r\nrecognizing, our captain, he pulled his hat down over his eyes. It was\r\nthis action, perhaps, that attracted D’Artagnan’s attention. If so,\r\nthe gentleman who had pulled down his hat produced an effect entirely\r\ndifferent from what he had desired. In other respects his costume was\r\nplain, and his hair evenly cut enough for customers, who were not close\r\nobservers, to take him for a mere tailor’s apprentice, perched behind\r\nthe board, and carefully stitching cloth or velvet. Nevertheless, this\r\nman held up his head too often to be very productively employed with his\r\nfingers. D’Artagnan was not deceived,--not he; and he saw at once that\r\nif this man was working at anything, it certainly was not at velvet.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” said he, addressing this man, “and so you have become a tailor’s\r\nboy, Monsieur Moliere!”\r\n\r\n“Hush, M. d’Artagnan!” replied the man, softly, “you will make them\r\nrecognize me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and what harm?”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, there is no harm, but--”\r\n\r\n“You were going to say there is no good in doing it either, is it not\r\nso?”\r\n\r\n“Alas! no; for I was occupied in examining some excellent figures.”\r\n\r\n“Go on--go on, Monsieur Moliere. I quite understand the interest you\r\ntake in the plates--I will not disturb your studies.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\n“But on one condition; that you tell me where M. Percerin really is.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! willingly; in his own room. Only--”\r\n\r\n“Only that one can’t enter it?”\r\n\r\n“Unapproachable.”\r\n\r\n“For everybody?”\r\n\r\n“Everybody. He brought me here so that I might be at my ease to make my\r\nobservations, and then he went away.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear Monsieur Moliere, but you will go and tell him I am\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“I!” exclaimed Moliere, in the tone of a courageous dog, from which\r\nyou snatch the bone it has legitimately gained; “I disturb myself! Ah!\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan, how hard you are upon me!”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t go directly and tell M. Percerin that I am here, my dear\r\nMoliere,” said D’Artagnan, in a low tone, “I warn you of one thing: that\r\nI won’t exhibit to you the friend I have brought with me.”\r\n\r\nMoliere indicated Porthos by an imperceptible gesture, “This gentleman,\r\nis it not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nMoliere fixed upon Porthos one of those looks which penetrate the minds\r\nand hearts of men. The subject doubtless appeared a very promising one,\r\nfor he immediately rose and led the way into the adjoining chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV. The Patterns.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the noble mob was slowly heaving away, leaving at\r\nevery angle of the counter either a murmur or a menace, as the waves\r\nleave foam or scattered seaweed on the sands, when they retire with the\r\nebbing tide. In about ten minutes Moliere reappeared, making another\r\nsign to D’Artagnan from under the hangings. The latter hurried after\r\nhim, with Porthos in the rear, and after threading a labyrinth of\r\ncorridors, introduced him to M. Percerin’s room. The old man, with his\r\nsleeves turned up, was gathering up in folds a piece of gold-flowered\r\nbrocade, so as the better to exhibit its luster. Perceiving D’Artagnan,\r\nhe put the silk aside, and came to meet him, by no means radiant with\r\njoy, and by no means courteous, but, take it altogether, in a tolerably\r\ncivil manner.\r\n\r\n“The captain of the king’s musketeers will excuse me, I am sure, for I\r\nam engaged.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! yes, on the king’s costumes; I know that, my dear Monsieur\r\nPercerin. You are making three, they tell me.”\r\n\r\n“Five, my dear sir, five.”\r\n\r\n“Three or five, ‘tis all the same to me, my dear monsieur; and I know\r\nthat you will make them most exquisitely.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know. Once made they will be the most beautiful in the world,\r\nI do not deny it; but that they may be the most beautiful in the word,\r\nthey must first be made; and to do this, captain, I am pressed for\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, bah! there are two days yet; ‘tis much more than you require,\r\nMonsieur Percerin,” said D’Artagnan, in the coolest possible manner.\r\n\r\nPercerin raised his head with the air of a man little accustomed to be\r\ncontradicted, even in his whims; but D’Artagnan did not pay the least\r\nattention to the airs which the illustrious tailor began to assume.\r\n\r\n“My dear M. Percerin,” he continued, “I bring you a customer.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! ah!” exclaimed Percerin, crossly.\r\n\r\n“M. le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de Pierrefonds,” continued\r\nD’Artagnan. Percerin attempted a bow, which found no favor in the eyes\r\nof the terrible Porthos, who, from his first entry into the room, had\r\nbeen regarding the tailor askance.\r\n\r\n“A very good friend of mine,” concluded D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“I will attend to monsieur,” said Percerin, “but later.”\r\n\r\n“Later? but when?”\r\n\r\n“When I have time.”\r\n\r\n“You have already told my valet as much,” broke in Porthos,\r\ndiscontentedly.\r\n\r\n“Very likely,” said Percerin; “I am nearly always pushed for time.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” returned Porthos, sententiously, “there is always time to\r\nbe found when one chooses to seek it.”\r\n\r\nPercerin turned crimson; an ominous sign indeed in old men blanched by\r\nage.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur is quite at liberty to confer his custom elsewhere.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come, Percerin,” interposed D’Artagnan, “you are not in a good\r\ntemper to-day. Well, I will say one more word to you, which will bring\r\nyou on your knees; monsieur is not only a friend of mine, but more, a\r\nfriend of M. Fouquet’s.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! ah!” exclaimed the tailor, “that is another thing.” Then turning\r\nto Porthos, “Monsieur le baron is attached to the superintendent?” he\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n“I am attached to myself,” shouted Porthos, at the very moment that the\r\ntapestry was raised to introduce a new speaker in the dialogue. Moliere\r\nwas all observation, D’Artagnan laughed, Porthos swore.\r\n\r\n“My dear Percerin,” said D’Artagnan, “you will make a dress for the\r\nbaron. ‘Tis I who ask you.”\r\n\r\n“To you I will not say nay, captain.”\r\n\r\n“But that is not all; you will make it for him at once.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis impossible within eight days.”\r\n\r\n“That, then, is as much as to refuse, because the dress is wanted for\r\nthe _fete_ at Vaux.”\r\n\r\n“I repeat that it is impossible,” returned the obstinate old man.\r\n\r\n“By no means, dear Monsieur Percerin, above all if _I_ ask you,” said a\r\nmild voice at the door, a silvery voice which made D’Artagnan prick up\r\nhis ears. It was the voice of Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Herblay!” cried the tailor.\r\n\r\n“Aramis,” murmured D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Ah! our bishop!” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, D’Artagnan; good morning, Porthos; good-morning, my dear\r\nfriends,” said Aramis. “Come, come, M. Percerin, make the baron’s\r\ndress; and I will answer for it you will gratify M. Fouquet.” And he\r\naccompanied the words with a sign, which seemed to say, “Agree, and\r\ndismiss them.”\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior\r\neven to D’Artagnan’s, for the tailor bowed in assent, and turning round\r\nupon Porthos, said, “Go and get measured on the other side.”\r\n\r\nPorthos colored in a formidable manner. D’Artagnan saw the storm coming,\r\nand addressing Moliere, said to him, in an undertone, “You see before\r\nyou, my dear monsieur, a man who considers himself disgraced, if you\r\nmeasure the flesh and bones that Heaven has given him; study this type\r\nfor me, Master Aristophanes, and profit by it.”\r\n\r\nMoliere had no need of encouragement, and his gaze dwelt long and keenly\r\non the Baron Porthos. “Monsieur,” he said, “if you will come with me, I\r\nwill make them take your measure without touching you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Porthos, “how do you make that out, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“I say that they shall apply neither line nor rule to the seams of\r\nyour dress. It is a new method we have invented for measuring people of\r\nquality, who are too sensitive to allow low-born fellows to touch\r\nthem. We know some susceptible persons who will not put up with being\r\nmeasured, a process which, as I think, wounds the natural dignity of a\r\nman; and if perchance monsieur should be one of these--”\r\n\r\n“_Corboeuf!_ I believe I am too!”\r\n\r\n“Well, that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence, and you shall\r\nhave the benefit of our invention.”\r\n\r\n“But how in the world can it be done?” asked Porthos, delighted.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said Moliere, bowing, “if you will deign to follow me, you\r\nwill see.”\r\n\r\nAramis observed this scene with all his eyes. Perhaps he fancied from\r\nD’Artagnan’s liveliness that he would leave with Porthos, so as not to\r\nlose the conclusion of a scene well begun. But, clear-sighted as he was,\r\nAramis deceived himself. Porthos and Moliere left together: D’Artagnan\r\nremained with Percerin. Why? From curiosity, doubtless; probably to\r\nenjoy a little longer the society of his good friend Aramis. As Moliere\r\nand Porthos disappeared, D’Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes, a\r\nproceeding which appeared particularly to disconcert him.\r\n\r\n“A dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?”\r\n\r\nAramis smiled. “No,” said he.\r\n\r\n“You will go to Vaux, however?”\r\n\r\n“I shall go, but without a new dress. You forget, dear D’Artagnan, that\r\na poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to have new dresses for every\r\n_fete_.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said the musketeer, laughing, “and do we write no more poems now,\r\neither?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! D’Artagnan,” exclaimed Aramis, “I have long ago given up all such\r\ntomfoolery.”\r\n\r\n“True,” repeated D’Artagnan, only half convinced. As for Percerin, he\r\nwas once more absorbed in contemplation of the brocades.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you perceive,” said Aramis, smiling, “that we are greatly boring\r\nthis good gentleman, my dear D’Artagnan?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! ah!” murmured the musketeer, aside; “that is, I am boring you,\r\nmy friend.” Then aloud, “Well, then, let us leave; I have no further\r\nbusiness here, and if you are as disengaged as I, Aramis--”\r\n\r\n“No, not I--I wished--”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you had something particular to say to M. Percerin? Why did you not\r\ntell me so at once?”\r\n\r\n“Something particular, certainly,” repeated Aramis, “but not for you,\r\nD’Artagnan. But, at the same time, I hope you will believe that I can\r\nnever have anything so particular to say that a friend like you may not\r\nhear it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no! I am going,” said D’Artagnan, imparting to his voice an\r\nevident tone of curiosity; for Aramis’s annoyance, well dissembled as it\r\nwas, had not a whit escaped him; and he knew that, in that impenetrable\r\nmind, every thing, even the most apparently trivial, was designed to\r\nsome end; an unknown one, but an end that, from the knowledge he had of\r\nhis friend’s character, the musketeer felt must be important.\r\n\r\nOn his part, Aramis saw that D’Artagnan was not without suspicion, and\r\npressed him. “Stay, by all means,” he said, “this is what it is.” Then\r\nturning towards the tailor, “My dear Percerin,” said he,--“I am even\r\nvery happy that you are here, D’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed,” exclaimed the Gascon, for the third time, even less\r\ndeceived this time than before.\r\n\r\nPercerin never moved. Aramis roused him violently, by snatching from his\r\nhands the stuff upon which he was engaged. “My dear Percerin,” said he,\r\n“I have, near hand, M. Lebrun, one of M. Fouquet’s painters.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, very good,” thought D’Artagnan; “but why Lebrun?”\r\n\r\nAramis looked at D’Artagnan, who seemed to be occupied with an engraving\r\nof Mark Antony. “And you wish that I should make him a dress, similar to\r\nthose of the Epicureans?” answered Percerin. And while saying this, in\r\nan absent manner, the worthy tailor endeavored to recapture his piece of\r\nbrocade.\r\n\r\n“An Epicurean’s dress?” asked D’Artagnan, in a tone of inquiry.\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Aramis, with a most engaging smile, “it is written that\r\nour dear D’Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening. Yes,\r\nfriend, you have surely heard speak of M. Fouquet’s Epicureans, have you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly. Is it not a kind of poetical society, of which La\r\nFontaine, Loret, Pelisson, and Moliere are members, and which holds its\r\nsittings at Saint-Mande?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly so. Well, we are going to put our poets in uniform, and enroll\r\nthem in a regiment for the king.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very well, I understand; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for\r\nthe king. Be at ease; if that is the secret about M. Lebrun, I will not\r\nmention it.”\r\n\r\n“Always agreeable, my friend. No, Monsieur Lebrun has nothing to do with\r\nthis part of it; the secret which concerns him is far more important\r\nthan the other.”\r\n\r\n“Then, if it is so important as all that, I prefer not to know it,” said\r\nD’Artagnan, making a show of departure.\r\n\r\n“Come in, M. Lebrun, come in,” said Aramis, opening a side-door with his\r\nright hand, and holding back D’Artagnan with his left.\r\n\r\n“I’faith, I too, am quite in the dark,” quoth Percerin.\r\n\r\nAramis took an “opportunity,” as is said in theatrical matters.\r\n\r\n“My dear M. de Percerin,” Aramis continued, “you are making five dresses\r\nfor the king, are you not? One in brocade; one in hunting-cloth; one in\r\nvelvet; one in satin; and one in Florentine stuffs.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but how--do you know all that, monseigneur?” said Percerin,\r\nastounded.\r\n\r\n“It is all very simple, my dear monsieur; there will be a hunt, a\r\nbanquet, concert, promenade and reception; these five kinds of dress are\r\nrequired by etiquette.”\r\n\r\n“You know everything, monseigneur!”\r\n\r\n“And a thing or two in addition,” muttered D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“But,” cried the tailor, in triumph, “what you do not know,\r\nmonseigneur--prince of the church though you are--what nobody will\r\nknow--what only the king, Mademoiselle de la Vallière, and myself do\r\nknow, is the color of the materials and nature of the ornaments, and the\r\ncut, the _ensemble_, the finish of it all!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Aramis, “that is precisely what I have come to ask you,\r\ndear Percerin.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, bah!” exclaimed the tailor, terrified, though Aramis had pronounced\r\nthese words in his softest and most honeyed tones. The request appeared,\r\non reflection, so exaggerated, so ridiculous, so monstrous to M.\r\nPercerin that first he laughed to himself, then aloud, and finished\r\nwith a shout. D’Artagnan followed his example, not because he found the\r\nmatter so “very funny,” but in order not to allow Aramis to cool.\r\n\r\n“At the outset, I appear to be hazarding an absurd question, do I not?”\r\n said Aramis. “But D’Artagnan, who is incarnate wisdom itself, will tell\r\nyou that I could not do otherwise than ask you this.”\r\n\r\n“Let us see,” said the attentive musketeer; perceiving with his\r\nwonderful instinct that they had only been skirmishing till now, and\r\nthat the hour of battle was approaching.\r\n\r\n“Let us see,” said Percerin, incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Why, now,” continued Aramis, “does M. Fouquet give the king a\r\n_fete?_--Is it not to please him?”\r\n\r\n“Assuredly,” said Percerin. D’Artagnan nodded assent.\r\n\r\n“By delicate attentions? by some happy device? by a succession of\r\nsurprises, like that of which we were talking?--the enrolment of our\r\nEpicureans.”\r\n\r\n“Admirable.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then; this is the surprise we intend. M. Lebrun here is a man who\r\ndraws most excellently.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Percerin; “I have seen his pictures, and observed that his\r\ndresses were highly elaborated. That is why I at once agreed to make him\r\na costume--whether to agree with those of the Epicureans, or an original\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“My dear monsieur, we accept your offer, and shall presently avail\r\nourselves of it; but just now, M. Lebrun is not in want of the dresses\r\nyou will make for himself, but of those you are making for the king.”\r\n\r\nPercerin made a bound backwards, which D’Artagnan--calmest and most\r\nappreciative of men, did not consider overdone, so many strange and\r\nstartling aspects wore the proposal which Aramis had just hazarded. “The\r\nking’s dresses! Give the king’s dresses to any mortal whatever! Oh!\r\nfor once, monseigneur, your grace is mad!” cried the poor tailor in\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\n“Help me now, D’Artagnan,” said Aramis, more and more calm and smiling.\r\n“Help me now to persuade monsieur, for _you_ understand; do you not?”\r\n\r\n“Eh! eh!--not exactly, I declare.”\r\n\r\n“What! you do not understand that M. Fouquet wishes to afford the king\r\nthe surprise of finding his portrait on his arrival at Vaux; and that\r\nthe portrait, which be a striking resemblance, ought to be dressed\r\nexactly as the king will be on the day it is shown?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, yes,” said the musketeer, nearly convinced, so plausible was\r\nthis reasoning. “Yes, my dear Aramis, you are right; it is a happy idea.\r\nI will wager it is one of your own, Aramis.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don’t know,” replied the bishop; “either mine or M. Fouquet’s.”\r\n Then scanning Percerin, after noticing D’Artagnan’s hesitation, “Well,\r\nMonsieur Percerin,” he asked, “what do you say to this?”\r\n\r\n“I say, that--”\r\n\r\n“That you are, doubtless, free to refuse. I know well--and I by no means\r\ncount upon compelling you, my dear monsieur. I will say more, I even\r\nunderstand all the delicacy you feel in taking up with M. Fouquet’s\r\nidea; you dread appearing to flatter the king. A noble spirit, M.\r\nPercerin, a noble spirit!” The tailor stammered. “It would, indeed, be a\r\nvery pretty compliment to pay the young prince,” continued Aramis; “but\r\nas the surintendant told me, ‘if Percerin refuse, tell him that it\r\nwill not at all lower him in my opinion, and I shall always esteem him,\r\nonly--’”\r\n\r\n“‘Only?’” repeated Percerin, rather troubled.\r\n\r\n“‘Only,’” continued Aramis, “‘I shall be compelled to say to the\r\nking,’--you understand, my dear Monsieur Percerin, that these are M.\r\nFouquet’s words,--‘I shall be constrained to say to the king, “Sire, I\r\nhad intended to present your majesty with your portrait, but owing to a\r\nfeeling of delicacy, slightly exaggerated perhaps, although creditable,\r\nM. Percerin opposed the project.”’”\r\n\r\n“Opposed!” cried the tailor, terrified at the responsibility which would\r\nweigh upon him; “I to oppose the desire, the will of M. Fouquet when he\r\nis seeking to please the king! Oh, what a hateful word you have uttered,\r\nmonseigneur. Oppose! Oh, ‘tis not I who said it, Heaven have mercy on\r\nme. I call the captain of the musketeers to witness it! Is it not true,\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan, that I have opposed nothing?”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan made a sign indicating that he wished to remain neutral. He\r\nfelt that there was an intrigue at the bottom of it, whether comedy or\r\ntragedy; he was at his wit’s end at not being able to fathom it, but in\r\nthe meanwhile wished to keep clear.\r\n\r\nBut already Percerin, goaded by the idea that the king was to be told he\r\nstood in the way of a pleasant surprise, had offered Lebrun a chair, and\r\nproceeded to bring from a wardrobe four magnificent dresses, the\r\nfifth being still in the workmen’s hands; and these masterpieces he\r\nsuccessively fitted upon four lay figures, which, imported into France\r\nin the time of Concini, had been given to Percerin II. by Marshal\r\nd’Onore, after the discomfiture of the Italian tailors ruined in their\r\ncompetition. The painter set to work to draw and then to paint the\r\ndresses. But Aramis, who was closely watching all the phases of his\r\ntoil, suddenly stopped him.\r\n\r\n“I think you have not quite got it, my dear Lebrun,” he said; “your\r\ncolors will deceive you, and on canvas we shall lack that exact\r\nresemblance which is absolutely requisite. Time is necessary for\r\nattentively observing the finer shades.”\r\n\r\n“Quite true,” said Percerin, “but time is wanting, and on that head, you\r\nwill agree with me, monseigneur, I can do nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Then the affair will fail,” said Aramis, quietly, “and that because of\r\na want of precision in the colors.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless Lebrun went on copying the materials and ornaments with\r\nthe closest fidelity--a process which Aramis watched with ill-concealed\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n“What in the world, now, is the meaning of this imbroglio?” the\r\nmusketeer kept saying to himself.\r\n\r\n“That will never do,” said Aramis: “M. Lebrun, close your box, and roll\r\nup your canvas.”\r\n\r\n“But, monsieur,” cried the vexed painter, “the light is abominable\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\n“An idea, M. Lebrun, an idea! If we had a pattern of the materials, for\r\nexample, and with time, and a better light--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, then,” cried Lebrun, “I would answer for the effect.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” said D’Artagnan, “this ought to be the knotty point of the whole\r\nthing; they want a pattern of each of the materials. _Mordioux!_ Will\r\nthis Percerin give in now?”\r\n\r\nPercerin, beaten from his last retreat, and duped, moreover, by the\r\nfeigned good-nature of Aramis, cut out five patterns and handed them to\r\nthe bishop of Vannes.\r\n\r\n“I like this better. That is your opinion, is it not?” said Aramis to\r\nD’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“My dear Aramis,” said D’Artagnan, “my opinion is that you are always\r\nthe same.”\r\n\r\n“And, consequently, always your friend,” said the bishop in a charming\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” said D’Artagnan, aloud; then, in a low voice, “If I am your\r\ndupe, double Jesuit that you are, I will not be your accomplice; and\r\nto prevent it, ‘tis time I left this place.--Adieu, Aramis,” he added\r\naloud, “adieu; I am going to rejoin Porthos.”\r\n\r\n“Then wait for me,” said Aramis, pocketing the patterns, “for I have\r\ndone, and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend.”\r\n\r\nLebrun packed up his paints and brushes, Percerin put back the dresses\r\ninto the closet, Aramis put his hand on his pocket to assure himself the\r\npatterns were secure,--and they all left the study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V. Where, Probably, Moliere Obtained His First Idea of the\r\nBourgeois Gentilhomme.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan found Porthos in the adjoining chamber; but no longer an\r\nirritated Porthos, or a disappointed Porthos, but Porthos radiant,\r\nblooming, fascinating, and chattering with Moliere, who was looking\r\nupon him with a species of idolatry, and as a man would who had not only\r\nnever seen anything greater, but not even ever anything so great. Aramis\r\nwent straight up to Porthos and offered him his white hand, which lost\r\nitself in the gigantic clasp of his old friend,--an operation which\r\nAramis never hazarded without a certain uneasiness. But the friendly\r\npressure having been performed not too painfully for him, the bishop of\r\nVannes passed over to Moliere.\r\n\r\n“Well, monsieur,” said he, “will you come with me to Saint-Mande?”\r\n\r\n“I will go anywhere you like, monseigneur,” answered Moliere.\r\n\r\n“To Saint-Mande!” cried Porthos, surprised at seeing the proud bishop\r\nof Vannes fraternizing with a journeyman tailor. “What, Aramis, are you\r\ngoing to take this gentleman to Saint-Mande?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Aramis, smiling, “our work is pressing.”\r\n\r\n“And besides, my dear Porthos,” continued D’Artagnan, “M. Moliere is not\r\naltogether what he seems.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?” asked Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Why, this gentleman is one of M. Percerin’s chief clerks, and is\r\nexpected at Saint-Mande to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has\r\nordered for the Epicureans.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis precisely so,” said Moliere.\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Come, then, my dear M. Moliere,” said Aramis, “that is, if you have\r\ndone with M. du Vallon.”\r\n\r\n“We have finished,” replied Porthos.\r\n\r\n“And you are satisfied?” asked D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Completely so,” replied Porthos.\r\n\r\nMoliere took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony, and grasped the\r\nhand which the captain of the musketeers furtively offered him.\r\n\r\n“Pray, monsieur,” concluded Porthos, mincingly, “above all, be exact.”\r\n\r\n“You will have your dress the day after to-morrow, monsieur le baron,”\r\n answered Moliere. And he left with Aramis.\r\n\r\nThen D’Artagnan, taking Porthos’s arm, “What has this tailor done for\r\nyou, my dear Porthos,” he asked, “that you are so pleased with him?”\r\n\r\n“What has he done for me, my friend! done for me!” cried Porthos,\r\nenthusiastically.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I ask you, what has he done for you?”\r\n\r\n“My friend, he has done that which no tailor ever yet accomplished: he\r\nhas taken my measure without touching me!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, bah! tell me how he did it.”\r\n\r\n“First, then, they went, I don’t know where, for a number of lay\r\nfigures, of all heights and sizes, hoping there would be one to suit\r\nmine, but the largest--that of the drum-major of the Swiss guard--was\r\ntwo inches too short, and a half foot too narrow in the chest.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\n“It is exactly as I tell you, D’Artagnan; but he is a great man, or at\r\nthe very least a great tailor, is this M. Moliere. He was not at all put\r\nat fault by the circumstance.”\r\n\r\n“What did he do, then?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! it is a very simple matter. I’faith, ‘tis an unheard-of thing that\r\npeople should have been so stupid as not to have discovered this method\r\nfrom the first. What annoyance and humiliation they would have spared\r\nme!”\r\n\r\n“Not to mention of the costumes, my dear Porthos.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, thirty dresses.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear Porthos, come, tell me M. Moliere’s plan.”\r\n\r\n“Moliere? You call him so, do you? I shall make a point of recollecting\r\nhis name.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; or Poquelin, if you prefer that.”\r\n\r\n“No; I like Moliere best. When I wish to recollect his name, I shall\r\nthink of _voliere_ [an aviary]; and as I have one at Pierrefonds--”\r\n\r\n“Capital!” returned D’Artagnan. “And M. Moliere’s plan?”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis this: instead of pulling me to pieces, as all these rascals\r\ndo--of making me bend my back, and double my joints--all of them low and\r\ndishonorable practices--” D’Artagnan made a sign of approbation with\r\nhis head. “‘Monsieur,’ he said to me,” continued Porthos, “‘a gentleman\r\nought to measure himself. Do me the pleasure to draw near this glass;’\r\nand I drew near the glass. I must own I did not exactly understand what\r\nthis good M. Voliere wanted with me.”\r\n\r\n“Moliere!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes, Moliere--Moliere. And as the fear of being measured still\r\npossessed me, ‘Take care,’ said I to him, ‘what you are going to do with\r\nme; I am very ticklish, I warn you.’ But he, with his soft voice (for\r\nhe is a courteous fellow, we must admit, my friend), he with his soft\r\nvoice, ‘Monsieur,’ said he, ‘that your dress may fit you well, it must\r\nbe made according to your figure. Your figure is exactly reflected in\r\nthis mirror. We shall take the measure of this reflection.’”\r\n\r\n“In fact,” said D’Artagnan, “you saw yourself in the glass; but where\r\ndid they find one in which you could see your whole figure?”\r\n\r\n“My good friend, it is the very glass in which the king is used to look\r\nto see himself.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but the king is a foot and a half shorter than you are.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! well, I know not how that may be; it is, no doubt, a cunning way\r\nof flattering the king; but the looking-glass was too large for me.\r\n‘Tis true that its height was made up of three Venetian plates of\r\nglass, placed one above another, and its breadth of three similar\r\nparallelograms in juxtaposition.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Porthos! what excellent words you have command of. Where in the\r\nword did you acquire such a voluminous vocabulary?”\r\n\r\n“At Belle-Isle. Aramis and I had to use such words in our strategic\r\nstudies and castramentative experiments.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan recoiled, as though the sesquipedalian syllables had knocked\r\nthe breath out of his body.\r\n\r\n“Ah! very good. Let us return to the looking-glass, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Then, this good M. Voliere--”\r\n\r\n“Moliere.”\r\n\r\n“Yes--Moliere--you are right. You will see now, my dear friend, that I\r\nshall recollect his name quite well. This excellent M. Moliere set to\r\nwork tracing out lines on the mirror, with a piece of Spanish chalk,\r\nfollowing in all the make of my arms and my shoulders, all the while\r\nexpounding this maxim, which I thought admirable: ‘It is advisable that\r\na dress should not incommode its wearer.’”\r\n\r\n“In reality,” said D’Artagnan, “that is an excellent maxim, which is,\r\nunfortunately, seldom carried out in practice.”\r\n\r\n“That is why I found it all the more astonishing, when he expatiated\r\nupon it.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! he expatiated?”\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu!_”\r\n\r\n“Let me hear his theory.”\r\n\r\n“‘Seeing that,’ he continued, ‘one may, in awkward circumstances, or in\r\na troublesome position, have one’s doublet on one’s shoulder, and not\r\ndesire to take one’s doublet off--’”\r\n\r\n“True,” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“‘And so,’ continued M. Voliere--”\r\n\r\n“Moliere.”\r\n\r\n“Moliere, yes. ‘And so,’ went on M. Moliere, ‘you want to draw your\r\nsword, monsieur, and you have your doublet on your back. What do you\r\ndo?’\r\n\r\n“‘I take it off,’ I answered.\r\n\r\n“‘Well, no,’ he replied.\r\n\r\n“‘How no?’\r\n\r\n“‘I say that the dress should be so well made, that it will in no way\r\nencumber you, even in drawing your sword.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah, ah!’\r\n\r\n“‘Throw yourself on guard,’ pursued he.\r\n\r\n“I did it with such wondrous firmness, that two panes of glass burst out\r\nof the window.\r\n\r\n“‘’Tis nothing, nothing,’ said he. ‘Keep your position.’\r\n\r\n“I raised my left arm in the air, the forearm gracefully bent, the\r\nruffle drooping, and my wrist curved, while my right arm, half extended,\r\nsecurely covered my wrist with the elbow, and my breast with the wrist.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said D’Artagnan, “‘tis the true guard--the academic guard.”\r\n\r\n“You have said the very word, dear friend. In the meanwhile, Voliere--”\r\n\r\n“Moliere.”\r\n\r\n“Hold! I should certainly, after all, prefer to call him--what did you\r\nsay his other name was?”\r\n\r\n“Poquelin.”\r\n\r\n“I prefer to call him Poquelin.”\r\n\r\n“And how will you remember this name better than the other?”\r\n\r\n“You understand, he calls himself Poquelin, does he not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“If I were to call to mind Madame Coquenard.”\r\n\r\n“Good.”\r\n\r\n“And change _Coc_ into _Poc_, _nard_ into _lin_; and instead of\r\nCoquenard I shall have Poquelin.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis wonderful,” cried D’Artagnan, astounded. “Go on, my friend, I am\r\nlistening to you with admiration.”\r\n\r\n“This Coquelin sketched my arm on the glass.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon--Poquelin.”\r\n\r\n“What did I say, then?”\r\n\r\n“You said Coquelin.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! true. This Poquelin, then, sketched my arm on the glass; but he\r\ntook his time over it; he kept looking at me a good deal. The fact is,\r\nthat I must have been looking particularly handsome.”\r\n\r\n“‘Does it weary you?’ he asked.\r\n\r\n“‘A little,’ I replied, bending a little in my hands, ‘but I could hold\r\nout for an hour or so longer.’\r\n\r\n“‘No, no, I will not allow it; the willing fellows will make it a duty\r\nto support your arms, as of old, men supported those of the prophet.’\r\n\r\n“‘Very good,’ I answered.\r\n\r\n“‘That will not be humiliating to you?’\r\n\r\n“‘My friend,’ said I, ‘there is, I think, a great difference between\r\nbeing supported and being measured.’”\r\n\r\n“The distinction is full of the soundest sense,” interrupted D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Then,” continued Porthos, “he made a sign: two lads approached; one\r\nsupported my left arm, while the other, with infinite address, supported\r\nmy right.”\r\n\r\n“‘Another, my man,’ cried he. A third approached. ‘Support monsieur by\r\nthe waist,’ said he. The _garcon_ complied.”\r\n\r\n“So that you were at rest?” asked D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly; and Pocquenard drew me on the glass.”\r\n\r\n“Poquelin, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Poquelin--you are right. Stay, decidedly I prefer calling him Voliere.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and then it was over, wasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“During that time Voliere drew me as I appeared in the mirror.”\r\n\r\n“‘Twas delicate in him.”\r\n\r\n“I much like the plan; it is respectful, and keeps every one in his\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“And there it ended?”\r\n\r\n“Without a soul having touched me, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Except the three _garcons_ who supported you.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless; but I have, I think, already explained to you the difference\r\nthere is between supporting and measuring.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis true,” answered D’Artagnan; who said afterwards to himself,\r\n“I’faith, I greatly deceive myself, or I have been the means of a good\r\nwindfall to that rascal Moliere, and we shall assuredly see the scene\r\nhit off to the life in some comedy or other.” Porthos smiled.\r\n\r\n“What are you laughing at?” asked D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Must I confess? Well, I was laughing over my good fortune.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that is true; I don’t know a happier man than you. But what is this\r\nlast piece of luck that has befallen you?’\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear fellow, congratulate me.”\r\n\r\n“I desire nothing better.”\r\n\r\n“It seems that I am the first who has had his measure taken in that\r\nmanner.”\r\n\r\n“Are you so sure of it?’\r\n\r\n“Nearly so. Certain signs of intelligence which passed between Voliere\r\nand the other _garcons_ showed me the fact.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my friend, that does not surprise me from Moliere,” said\r\nD’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Voliere, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no, indeed! I am very willing to leave you to go on saying\r\nVoliere; but, as for me, I shall continued to say Moliere. Well, this,\r\nI was saying, does not surprise me, coming from Moliere, who is a very\r\ningenious fellow, and inspired you with this grand idea.”\r\n\r\n“It will be of great use to him by and by, I am sure.”\r\n\r\n“Won’t it be of use to him, indeed? I believe you, it will, and that\r\nin the highest degree;--for you see my friend Moliere is of all\r\nknown tailors the man who best clothes our barons, comtes, and\r\nmarquises--according to their measure.”\r\n\r\nOn this observation, neither the application nor depth of which we\r\nshall discuss, D’Artagnan and Porthos quitted M. de Percerin’s house and\r\nrejoined their carriages, wherein we will leave them, in order to look\r\nafter Moliere and Aramis at Saint-Mande.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI. The Bee-Hive, the Bees, and the Honey.\r\n\r\nThe bishop of Vannes, much annoyed at having met D’Artagnan at M.\r\nPercerin’s, returned to Saint-Mande in no very good humor. Moliere,\r\non the other hand, quite delighted at having made such a capital rough\r\nsketch, and at knowing where to find his original again, whenever he\r\nshould desire to convert his sketch into a picture, Moliere arrived in\r\nthe merriest of moods. All the first story of the left wing was occupied\r\nby the most celebrated Epicureans in Paris, and those on the freest\r\nfooting in the house--every one in his compartment, like the bees in\r\ntheir cells, employed in producing the honey intended for that royal\r\ncake which M. Fouquet proposed to offer his majesty Louis XIV. during\r\nthe _fete_ at Vaux. Pelisson, his head leaning on his hand, was engaged\r\nin drawing out the plan of the prologue to the “Facheux,” a comedy in\r\nthree acts, which was to be put on the stage by Poquelin de Moliere, as\r\nD’Artagnan called him, or Coquelin de Voliere, as Porthos styled him.\r\nLoret, with all the charming innocence of a gazetteer,--the gazetteers\r\nof all ages have always been so artless!--Loret was composing an\r\naccount of the _fetes_ at Vaux, before those _fetes_ had taken place.\r\nLa Fontaine sauntered about from one to the other, a peripatetic,\r\nabsent-minded, boring, unbearable dreamer, who kept buzzing and humming\r\nat everybody’s elbow a thousand poetic abstractions. He so often\r\ndisturbed Pelisson, that the latter, raising his head, crossly said, “At\r\nleast, La Fontaine, supply me with a rhyme, since you have the run of\r\nthe gardens at Parnassus.”\r\n\r\n“What rhyme do you want?” asked the _Fabler_ as Madame de Sevigne used\r\nto call him.\r\n\r\n“I want a rhyme to _lumiere_.”\r\n\r\n“_Orniere_,” answered La Fontaine.\r\n\r\n“Ah, but, my good friend, one cannot talk of _wheel-ruts_ when\r\ncelebrating the delights of Vaux,” said Loret.\r\n\r\n“Besides, it doesn’t rhyme,” answered Pelisson.\r\n\r\n“What! doesn’t rhyme!” cried La Fontaine, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes; you have an abominable habit, my friend,--a habit which will ever\r\nprevent your becoming a poet of the first order. You rhyme in a slovenly\r\nmanner.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, oh, you think so, do you, Pelisson?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do, indeed. Remember that a rhyme is never good so long as one\r\ncan find a better.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will never write anything again save in prose,” said La\r\nFontaine, who had taken up Pelisson’s reproach in earnest. “Ah! I often\r\nsuspected I was nothing but a rascally poet! Yes, ‘tis the very truth.”\r\n\r\n“Do not say so; your remark is too sweeping, and there is much that is\r\ngood in your ‘Fables.’”\r\n\r\n“And to begin,” continued La Fontaine, following up his idea, “I will go\r\nand burn a hundred verses I have just made.”\r\n\r\n“Where are your verses?”\r\n\r\n“In my head.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if they are in your head you cannot burn them.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said La Fontaine; “but if I do not burn them--”\r\n\r\n“Well, what will happen if you do not burn them?”\r\n\r\n“They will remain in my mind, and I shall never forget them!”\r\n\r\n“The deuce!” cried Loret; “what a dangerous thing! One would go mad with\r\nit!”\r\n\r\n“The deuce! the deuce!” repeated La Fontaine; “what can I do?”\r\n\r\n“I have discovered the way,” said Moliere, who had entered just at this\r\npoint of the conversation.\r\n\r\n“What way?”\r\n\r\n“Write them first and burn them afterwards.”\r\n\r\n“How simple! Well, I should never have discovered that. What a mind that\r\ndevil of a Moliere has!” said La Fontaine. Then, striking his forehead,\r\n“Oh, thou wilt never be aught but an ass, Jean La Fontaine!” he added.\r\n\r\n“_What_ are you saying there, my friend?” broke in Moliere, approaching\r\nthe poet, whose aside he had heard.\r\n\r\n“I say I shall never be aught but an ass,” answered La Fontaine, with\r\na heavy sigh and swimming eyes. “Yes, my friend,” he added, with\r\nincreasing grief, “it seems that I rhyme in a slovenly manner.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, ‘tis wrong to say so.”\r\n\r\n“Nay, I am a poor creature!”\r\n\r\n“Who said so?”\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu!_ ‘twas Pelisson; did you not, Pelisson?”\r\n\r\nPelisson, again absorbed in his work, took good care not to answer.\r\n\r\n“But if Pelisson said you were so,” cried Moliere, “Pelisson has\r\nseriously offended you.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I advise you, as you are a gentleman, not to leave an insult like\r\nthat unpunished.”\r\n\r\n“_What!_” exclaimed La Fontaine.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever fight?”\r\n\r\n“Once only, with a lieutenant in the light horse.”\r\n\r\n“What wrong had he done you?”\r\n\r\n“It seems he ran away with my wife.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, ah!” said Moliere, becoming slightly pale; but as, at La Fontaine’s\r\ndeclaration, the others had turned round, Moliere kept upon his lips the\r\nrallying smile which had so nearly died away, and continuing to make La\r\nFontaine speak--\r\n\r\n“And what was the result of the duel?”\r\n\r\n“The result was, that on the ground my opponent disarmed me, and then\r\nmade an apology, promising never again to set foot in my house.”\r\n\r\n“And you considered yourself satisfied?” said Moliere.\r\n\r\n“Not at all! on the contrary, I picked up my sword. ‘I beg your pardon,\r\nmonsieur,’ I said, ‘I have not fought you because you were my wife’s\r\nfriend, but because I was told I ought to fight. So, as I have never\r\nknown any peace save since you made her acquaintance, do me the pleasure\r\nto continue your visits as heretofore, or _morbleu!_ let us set to\r\nagain.’ And so,” continued La Fontaine, “he was compelled to resume his\r\nfriendship with madame, and I continue to be the happiest of husbands.”\r\n\r\nAll burst out laughing. Moliere alone passed his hand across his eyes.\r\nWhy? Perhaps to wipe away a tear, perhaps to smother a sigh. Alas! we\r\nknow that Moliere was a moralist, but he was not a philosopher. “‘Tis\r\nall one,” he said, returning to the topic of the conversation, “Pelisson\r\nhas insulted you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, truly! I had already forgotten it.”\r\n\r\n“And I am going to challenge him on your behalf.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you can do so, if you think it indispensable.”\r\n\r\n“I do think it indispensable, and I am going to--”\r\n\r\n“Stay,” exclaimed La Fontaine, “I want your advice.”\r\n\r\n“Upon what? this insult?”\r\n\r\n“No; tell me really now whether _lumiere_ does not rhyme with\r\n_orniere_.”\r\n\r\n“I should make them rhyme.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I knew you would.”\r\n\r\n“And I have made a hundred thousand such rhymes in my time.”\r\n\r\n“A hundred thousand!” cried La Fontaine. “Four times as many as ‘La\r\nPucelle,’ which M. Chaplain is meditating. Is it also on this subject,\r\ntoo, that you have composed a hundred thousand verses?”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, you eternally absent-minded creature,” said Moliere.\r\n\r\n“It is certain,” continued La Fontaine, “that _legume_, for instance,\r\nrhymes with _posthume_.”\r\n\r\n“In the plural, above all.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, above all in the plural, seeing that then it rhymes not with three\r\nletters, but with four; as _orniere_ does with _lumiere_.”\r\n\r\n“But give me _ornieres_ and _lumieres_ in the plural, my dear Pelisson,”\r\n said La Fontaine, clapping his hand on the shoulder of his friend, whose\r\ninsult he had quite forgotten, “and they will rhyme.”\r\n\r\n“Hem!” coughed Pelisson.\r\n\r\n“Moliere says so, and Moliere is a judge of such things; he declares he\r\nhas himself made a hundred thousand verses.”\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Moliere, laughing, “he is off now.”\r\n\r\n“It is like _rivage_, which rhymes admirably with _herbage_. I would\r\ntake my oath of it.”\r\n\r\n“But--” said Moliere.\r\n\r\n“I tell you all this,” continued La Fontaine, “because you are preparing\r\na _divertissement_ for Vaux, are you not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the ‘Facheux.’”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, the ‘Facheux;’ yes, I recollect. Well, I was thinking a\r\nprologue would admirably suit your _divertissement_.”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless it would suit capitally.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you are of my opinion?”\r\n\r\n“So much so, that I have asked you to write this very prologue.”\r\n\r\n“You asked _me_ to write it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you, and on your refusal begged you to ask Pelisson, who is\r\nengaged upon it at this moment.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that is what Pelisson is doing, then? I’faith, my dear Moliere, you\r\nare indeed often right.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“When you call me absent-minded. It is a monstrous defect; I will cure\r\nmyself of it, and do your prologue for you.”\r\n\r\n“But inasmuch as Pelisson is about it!--”\r\n\r\n“Ah, true, miserable rascal that I am! Loret was indeed right in saying\r\nI was a poor creature.”\r\n\r\n“It was not Loret who said so, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, whoever said so, ‘tis the same to me! And so your\r\n_divertissement_ is called the ‘Facheux?’ Well, can you make _heureux_\r\nrhyme with _facheux?_”\r\n\r\n“If obliged, yes.”\r\n\r\n“And even with _capriceux_.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no.”\r\n\r\n“It would be hazardous, and yet why so?”\r\n\r\n“There is too great a difference in the cadences.”\r\n\r\n“I was fancying,” said La Fontaine, leaving Moliere for Loret--“I was\r\nfancying--”\r\n\r\n“What were you fancying?” said Loret, in the middle of a sentence. “Make\r\nhaste.”\r\n\r\n“You are writing the prologue to the ‘Facheux,’ are you not?”\r\n\r\n“No! _mordieu!_ it is Pelisson.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Pelisson,” cried La Fontaine, going over to him, “I was fancying,”\r\n he continued, “that the nymph of Vaux--”\r\n\r\n“Ah, beautiful!” cried Loret. “The nymph of Vaux! thank you, La\r\nFontaine; you have just given me the two concluding verses of my paper.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you can rhyme so well, La Fontaine,” said Pelisson, “tell me\r\nnow in what way you would begin my prologue?”\r\n\r\n“I should say, for instance, ‘Oh! nymph, who--’ After ‘who’ I should\r\nplace a verb in the second person singular of the present indicative;\r\nand should go on thus: ‘this grot profound.’”\r\n\r\n“But the verb, the verb?” asked Pelisson.\r\n\r\n“To admire the greatest king of all kings round,” continued La Fontaine.\r\n\r\n“But the verb, the verb,” obstinately insisted Pelisson. “This second\r\nperson singular of the present indicative?”\r\n\r\n“Well, then; quittest:\r\n\r\n“Oh, nymph, who quittest now this grot profound, To admire the greatest\r\nking of all kings round.”\r\n\r\n“You would not put ‘who quittest,’ would you?”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“‘Quittest,’ after ‘you who’?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! my dear fellow,” exclaimed La Fontaine, “you are a shocking\r\npedant!”\r\n\r\n“Without counting,” said Moliere, “that the second verse, ‘king of all\r\nkings round,’ is very weak, my dear La Fontaine.”\r\n\r\n“Then you see clearly I am nothing but a poor creature,--a shuffler, as\r\nyou said.”\r\n\r\n“I never said so.”\r\n\r\n“Then, as Loret said.”\r\n\r\n“And it was not Loret either; it was Pelisson.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Pelisson was right a hundred times over. But what annoys me more\r\nthan anything, my dear Moliere, is, that I fear we shall not have our\r\nEpicurean dresses.”\r\n\r\n“You expected yours, then, for the _fete?_”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for the _fete_, and then for after the _fete_. My housekeeper told\r\nme that my own is rather faded.”\r\n\r\n“_Diable!_ your housekeeper is right; rather more than faded.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you see,” resumed La Fontaine, “the fact is, I left it on the floor\r\nin my room, and my cat--”\r\n\r\n“Well, your cat--”\r\n\r\n“She made her nest upon it, which has rather changed its color.”\r\n\r\nMoliere burst out laughing; Pelisson and Loret followed his example. At\r\nthis juncture, the bishop of Vannes appeared, with a roll of plans and\r\nparchments under his arm. As if the angel of death had chilled all gay\r\nand sprightly fancies--as if that wan form had scared away the Graces\r\nto whom Xenocrates sacrificed--silence immediately reigned through the\r\nstudy, and every one resumed his self-possession and his pen. Aramis\r\ndistributed the notes of invitation, and thanked them in the name of\r\nM. Fouquet. “The superintendent,” he said, “being kept to his room by\r\nbusiness, could not come and see them, but begged them to send him some\r\nof the fruits of their day’s work, to enable him to forget the fatigue\r\nof his labor in the night.”\r\n\r\nAt these words, all settled down to work. La Fontaine placed himself at\r\na table, and set his rapid pen an endless dance across the smooth white\r\nvellum; Pelisson made a fair copy of his prologue; Moliere contributed\r\nfifty fresh verses, with which his visit to Percerin had inspired him;\r\nLoret, an article on the marvelous _fetes_ he predicted; and Aramis,\r\nladen with his booty like the king of the bees, that great black drone,\r\ndecked with purple and gold, re-entered his apartment, silent and\r\nbusy. But before departing, “Remember, gentlemen,” said he, “we leave\r\nto-morrow evening.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, I must give notice at home,” said Moliere.\r\n\r\n“Yes; poor Moliere!” said Loret, smiling; “he loves his home.”\r\n\r\n“‘_He_ loves,’ yes,” replied Moliere, with his sad, sweet smile. “‘He\r\nloves,’ that does not mean, they love _him_.”\r\n\r\n“As for me,” said La Fontaine, “they love me at Chateau Thierry, I am\r\nvery sure.”\r\n\r\nAramis here re-entered after a brief disappearance.\r\n\r\n“Will any one go with me?” he asked. “I am going by Paris, after having\r\npassed a quarter of an hour with M. Fouquet. I offer my carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said Moliere, “I accept it. I am in a hurry.”\r\n\r\n“I shall dine here,” said Loret. “M. de Gourville has promised me some\r\ncraw-fish.”\r\n\r\n“He has promised me some whitings. Find a rhyme for that, La Fontaine.”\r\n\r\nAramis went out laughing, as only he could laugh, and Moliere followed\r\nhim. They were at the bottom of the stairs, when La Fontaine opened the\r\ndoor, and shouted out:\r\n\r\n\r\n“He has promised us some whitings, In return for these our writings.”\r\n\r\nThe shouts of laughter reached the ears of Fouquet at the moment Aramis\r\nopened the door of the study. As to Moliere, he had undertaken to\r\norder the horses, while Aramis went to exchange a parting word with the\r\nsuperintendent. “Oh, how they are laughing there!” said Fouquet, with a\r\nsigh.\r\n\r\n“Do you not laugh, monseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“I laugh no longer now, M. d’Herblay. The _fete_ is approaching; money\r\nis departing.”\r\n\r\n“Have I not told you that was my business?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you promised me millions.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have them the day after the king’s _entree_ into Vaux.”\r\n\r\nFouquet looked closely at Aramis, and passed the back of his icy hand\r\nacross his moistened brow. Aramis perceived that the superintendent\r\neither doubted him, or felt he was powerless to obtain the money. How\r\ncould Fouquet suppose that a poor bishop, ex-abbe, ex-musketeer, could\r\nfind any?\r\n\r\n“Why doubt me?” said Aramis. Fouquet smiled and shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Man of little faith!” added the bishop.\r\n\r\n“My dear M. d’Herblay,” answered Fouquet, “if I fall--”\r\n\r\n“Well; if you ‘fall’?”\r\n\r\n“I shall, at least, fall from such a height, that I shall shatter myself\r\nin falling.” Then giving himself a shake, as though to escape from\r\nhimself, “Whence came you,” said he, “my friend?”\r\n\r\n“From Paris--from Percerin.”\r\n\r\n“And what have you been doing at Percerin’s, for I suppose you attach no\r\ngreat importance to our poets’ dresses?”\r\n\r\n“No; I went to prepare a surprise.”\r\n\r\n“Surprise?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; which you are going to give to the king.”\r\n\r\n“And will it cost much?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! a hundred pistoles you will give Lebrun.”\r\n\r\n“A painting?--Ah! all the better! And what is this painting to\r\nrepresent?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you; then at the same time, whatever you may say or think\r\nof it, I went to see the dresses for our poets.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! and they will be rich and elegant?”\r\n\r\n“Splendid! There will be few great monseigneurs with so good. People\r\nwill see the difference there is between the courtiers of wealth and\r\nthose of friendship.”\r\n\r\n“Ever generous and grateful, dear prelate.”\r\n\r\n“In your school.”\r\n\r\nFouquet grasped his hand. “And where are you going?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I am off to Paris, when you shall have given a certain letter.”\r\n\r\n“For whom?”\r\n\r\n“M. de Lyonne.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you want with Lyonne?”\r\n\r\n“I wish to make him sign a _lettre de cachet_.”\r\n\r\n“‘_Lettre de cachet!_’ Do you desire to put somebody in the Bastile?”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary--to let somebody out.”\r\n\r\n“And who?”\r\n\r\n“A poor devil--a youth, a lad who has been Bastiled these ten years, for\r\ntwo Latin verses he made against the Jesuits.”\r\n\r\n“‘Two Latin verses!’ and, for ‘two Latin verses,’ the miserable being\r\nhas been in prison for ten years!”\r\n\r\n“Yes!”\r\n\r\n“And has committed no other crime?”\r\n\r\n“Beyond this, he is as innocent as you or I.”\r\n\r\n“On your word?”\r\n\r\n“On my honor!”\r\n\r\n“And his name is--”\r\n\r\n“Seldon.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.--But it is too bad. You knew this, and you never told me!”\r\n\r\n“‘Twas only yesterday his mother applied to me, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“And the woman is poor!”\r\n\r\n“In the deepest misery.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven,” said Fouquet, “sometimes bears with such injustice on earth,\r\nthat I hardly wonder there are wretches who doubt of its existence.\r\nStay, M. d’Herblay.” And Fouquet, taking a pen, wrote a few rapid lines\r\nto his colleague Lyonne. Aramis took the letter and made ready to go.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” said Fouquet. He opened his drawer, and took out ten government\r\nnotes which were there, each for a thousand francs. “Stay,” he said;\r\n“set the son at liberty, and give this to the mother; but, above all, do\r\nnot tell her--”\r\n\r\n“What, monseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“That she is ten thousand livres richer than I. She would say I am but\r\na poor superintendent! Go! and I pray that God will bless those who are\r\nmindful of his poor!”\r\n\r\n“So also do I pray,” replied Aramis, kissing Fouquet’s hand.\r\n\r\nAnd he went out quickly, carrying off the letter for Lyonne and the\r\nnotes for Seldon’s mother, and taking up Moliere, who was beginning to\r\nlose patience.\r\n\r\nChapter VII. Another Supper at the Bastile.\r\n\r\nSeven o’clock sounded from the great clock of the Bastile, that famous\r\nclock, which, like all the accessories of the state prison, the very use\r\nof which is a torture, recalled to the prisoners’ minds the destination\r\nof every hour of their punishment. The time-piece of the Bastile,\r\nadorned with figures, like most of the clocks of the period, represented\r\nSt. Peter in bonds. It was the supper hour of the unfortunate captives.\r\nThe doors, grating on their enormous hinges, opened for the passage of\r\nthe baskets and trays of provisions, the abundance and the delicacy of\r\nwhich, as M. de Baisemeaux has himself taught us, was regulated by\r\nthe condition in life of the prisoner. We understand on this head\r\nthe theories of M. de Baisemeaux, sovereign dispenser of gastronomic\r\ndelicacies, head cook of the royal fortress, whose trays, full-laden,\r\nwere ascending the steep staircases, carrying some consolation to the\r\nprisoners in the shape of honestly filled bottles of good vintages. This\r\nsame hour was that of M. le gouverneur’s supper also. He had a guest\r\nto-day, and the spit turned more heavily than usual. Roast partridges,\r\nflanked with quails and flanking a larded leveret; boiled fowls; hams,\r\nfried and sprinkled with white wine, _cardons_ of Guipuzcoa and _la\r\nbisque ecrevisses_: these, together with soups and _hors d’oeuvres_,\r\nconstituted the governor’s bill of fare. Baisemeaux, seated at table,\r\nwas rubbing his hands and looking at the bishop of Vannes, who, booted\r\nlike a cavalier, dressed in gray and sword at side, kept talking of\r\nhis hunger and testifying the liveliest impatience. M. de Baisemeaux de\r\nMontlezun was not accustomed to the unbending movements of his greatness\r\nmy lord of Vannes, and this evening Aramis, becoming sprightly,\r\nvolunteered confidence on confidence. The prelate had again a little\r\ntouch of the musketeer about him. The bishop just trenched on the\r\nborders only of license in his style of conversation. As for M. de\r\nBaisemeaux, with the facility of vulgar people, he gave himself up\r\nentirely upon this point of his guest’s freedom. “Monsieur,” said he,\r\n“for indeed to-night I dare not call you monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“By no means,” said Aramis; “call me monsieur; I am booted.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know, monsieur, of whom you remind me this evening?”\r\n\r\n“No! faith,” said Aramis, taking up his glass; “but I hope I remind you\r\nof a capital guest.”\r\n\r\n“You remind me of two, monsieur. Francois, shut the window; the wind may\r\nannoy his greatness.”\r\n\r\n“And let him go,” added Aramis. “The supper is completely served, and\r\nwe shall eat it very well without waiters. I like exceedingly to be\r\n_tete-a-tete_ when I am with a friend.” Baisemeaux bowed respectfully.\r\n\r\n“I like exceedingly,” continued Aramis, “to help myself.”\r\n\r\n“Retire, Francois,” cried Baisemeaux. “I was saying that your greatness\r\nputs me in mind of two persons; one very illustrious, the late cardinal,\r\nthe great Cardinal de la Rochelle, who wore boots like you.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said Aramis; “and the other?”\r\n\r\n“The other was a certain musketeer, very handsome, very brave, very\r\nadventurous, very fortunate, who, from being abbe, turned musketeer, and\r\nfrom musketeer turned abbe.” Aramis condescended to smile. “From\r\nabbe,” continued Baisemeaux, encouraged by Aramis’s smile--“from abbe,\r\nbishop--and from bishop--”\r\n\r\n“Ah! stay there, I beg,” exclaimed Aramis.\r\n\r\n“I have just said, monsieur, that you gave me the idea of a cardinal.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, dear M. Baisemeaux. As you said, I have on the boots of a\r\ncavalier, but I do not intend, for all that, to embroil myself with the\r\nchurch this evening.”\r\n\r\n“But you have wicked intentions, nevertheless, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, wicked, I own, as everything mundane is.”\r\n\r\n“You traverse the town and the streets in disguise?”\r\n\r\n“In disguise, as you say.”\r\n\r\n“And you still make use of your sword?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I should think so; but only when I am compelled. Do me the\r\npleasure to summon Francois.”\r\n\r\n“Have you no wine there?”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis not for wine, but because it is hot here, and the window is shut.”\r\n\r\n“I shut the windows at supper-time so as not to hear the sounds or the\r\narrival of couriers.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes. You hear them when the window is open?”\r\n\r\n“But too well, and that disturbs me. You understand?”\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless I am suffocated. Francois.” Francois entered. “Open the\r\nwindows, I pray you, Master Francois,” said Aramis. “You will allow him,\r\ndear M. Baisemeaux?”\r\n\r\n“You are at home here,” answered the governor. The window was opened.\r\n“Do you not think,” said M. de Baisemeaux, “that you will find yourself\r\nvery lonely, now M. de la Fere has returned to his household gods at\r\nBlois? He is a very old friend, is he not?”\r\n\r\n“You know it as I do, Baisemeaux, seeing that you were in the musketeers\r\nwith us.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! with my friends I reckon neither bottles of wine nor years.”\r\n\r\n“And you are right. But I do more than love M. de la Fere, dear\r\nBaisemeaux; I venerate him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, for my part, though ‘tis singular,” said the governor, “I prefer\r\nM. d’Artagnan to him. There is a man for you, who drinks long and well!\r\nThat kind of people allow you at least to penetrate their thoughts.”\r\n\r\n“Baisemeaux, make me tipsy to-night; let us have a merry time of it as\r\nof old, and if I have a trouble at the bottom of my heart, I promise\r\nyou, you shall see it as you would a diamond at the bottom of your\r\nglass.”\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” said Baisemeaux, and he poured out a great glass of wine and\r\ndrank it off at a draught, trembling with joy at the idea of being, by\r\nhook or by crook, in the secret of some high archiepiscopal misdemeanor.\r\nWhile he was drinking he did not see with what attention Aramis was\r\nnoting the sounds in the great court. A courier came in about eight\r\no’clock as Francois brought in the fifth bottle, and, although the\r\ncourier made a great noise, Baisemeaux heard nothing.\r\n\r\n“The devil take him,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“What! who?” asked Baisemeaux. “I hope ‘tis neither the wine you drank\r\nnor he who is the cause of your drinking it.”\r\n\r\n“No; it is a horse, who is making noise enough in the court for a whole\r\nsquadron.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! some courier or other,” replied the governor, redoubling his\r\nattention to the passing bottle. “Yes; and may the devil take him, and\r\nso quickly that we shall never hear him speak more. Hurrah! hurrah!”\r\n\r\n“You forget me, Baisemeaux! my glass is empty,” said Aramis, lifting his\r\ndazzling Venetian goblet.\r\n\r\n“Upon my honor, you delight me. Francois, wine!” Francois entered.\r\n“Wine, fellow! and better.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur, yes; but a courier has just arrived.”\r\n\r\n“Let him go to the devil, I say.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur, but--”\r\n\r\n“Let him leave his news at the office; we will see to it to-morrow.\r\nTo-morrow, there will be time to-morrow; there will be daylight,” said\r\nBaisemeaux, chanting the words.\r\n\r\n“Ah, monsieur,” grumbled the soldier Francois, in spite of himself,\r\n“monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Take care,” said Aramis, “take care!”\r\n\r\n“Of what? dear M. d’Herblay,” said Baisemeaux, half intoxicated.\r\n\r\n“The letter which the courier brings to the governor of a fortress is\r\nsometimes an order.”\r\n\r\n“Nearly always.”\r\n\r\n“Do not orders issue from the ministers?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, undoubtedly; but--”\r\n\r\n“And what to these ministers do but countersign the signature of the\r\nking?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right. Nevertheless, ‘tis very tiresome when you are\r\nsitting before a good table, _tete-a-tete_ with a friend--Ah! I beg your\r\npardon, monsieur; I forgot it is I who engage you at supper, and that I\r\nspeak to a future cardinal.”\r\n\r\n“Let us pass over that, dear Baisemeaux, and return to our soldier, to\r\nFrancois.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and what has Francois done?”\r\n\r\n“He has demurred!”\r\n\r\n“He was wrong, then?”\r\n\r\n“However, he _has_ demurred, you see; ‘tis because there is something\r\nextraordinary in this matter. It is very possible that it was not\r\nFrancois who was wrong in demurring, but you, who are in the wrong in\r\nnot listening to him.”\r\n\r\n“Wrong? I to be wrong before Francois? that seems rather hard.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, merely an irregularity. But I thought it my duty to make an\r\nobservation which I deem important.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! perhaps you are right,” stammered Baisemeaux. “The king’s order\r\nis sacred; but as to orders that arrive when one is at supper, I repeat\r\nthat the devil--”\r\n\r\n“If you had said as much to the great cardinal--hem! my dear Baisemeaux,\r\nand if his order had any importance.”\r\n\r\n“I do it that I may not disturb a bishop. _Mordioux!_ am I not, then,\r\nexcusable?”\r\n\r\n“Do not forget, Baisemeaux, that I have worn the soldier’s coat, and I\r\nam accustomed to obedience everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“You wish, then--”\r\n\r\n“I wish that you would do your duty, my friend; yes, at least before\r\nthis soldier.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis mathematically true,” exclaimed Baisemeaux. Francois still\r\nwaited: “Let them send this order of the king’s up to me,” he repeated,\r\nrecovering himself. And he added in a low tone, “Do you know what it is?\r\nI will tell you something about as interesting as this. ‘Beware of fire\r\nnear the powder magazine;’ or, ‘Look close after such and such a one,\r\nwho is clever at escaping,’ Ah! if you only knew, monseigneur, how many\r\ntimes I have been suddenly awakened from the very sweetest, deepest\r\nslumber, by messengers arriving at full gallop to tell me, or\r\nrather, bring me a slip of paper containing these words: ‘Monsieur de\r\nBaisemeaux, what news?’ ‘Tis clear enough that those who waste their\r\ntime writing such orders have never slept in the Bastile. They would\r\nknow better; they have never considered the thickness of my walls, the\r\nvigilance of my officers, the number of rounds we go. But, indeed, what\r\ncan you expect, monseigneur? It is their business to write and torment\r\nme when I am at rest, and to trouble me when I am happy,” added\r\nBaisemeaux, bowing to Aramis. “Then let them do their business.”\r\n\r\n“And do you do yours,” added the bishop, smiling.\r\n\r\nFrancois re-entered; Baisemeaux took from his hands the minister’s\r\norder. He slowly undid it, and as slowly read it. Aramis pretended to\r\nbe drinking, so as to be able to watch his host through the glass. Then,\r\nBaisemeaux, having read it: “What was I just saying?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked the bishop.\r\n\r\n“An order of release! There, now; excellent news indeed to disturb us!”\r\n\r\n“Excellent news for him whom it concerns, you will at least agree, my\r\ndear governor!”\r\n\r\n“And at eight o’clock in the evening!”\r\n\r\n“It is charitable!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! charity is all very well, but it is for that fellow who says he\r\nis so weary and tired, but not for me who am amusing myself,” said\r\nBaisemeaux, exasperated.\r\n\r\n“Will you lose by him, then? And is the prisoner who is to be set at\r\nliberty a good payer?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, indeed! a miserable, five-franc rat!”\r\n\r\n“Let me see it,” asked M. d’Herblay. “It is no indiscretion?”\r\n\r\n“By no means; read it.”\r\n\r\n“There is ‘Urgent,’ on the paper; you have seen that, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, admirable! ‘Urgent!’--a man who has been there ten years! It\r\nis _urgent_ to set him free to-day, this very evening, at eight\r\no’clock!--_urgent!_” And Baisemeaux, shrugging his shoulders with an air\r\nof supreme disdain, flung the order on the table and began eating again.\r\n\r\n“They are fond of these tricks!” he said, with his mouth full; “they\r\nseize a man, some fine day, keep him under lock and key for ten years,\r\nand write to you, ‘Watch this fellow well,’ or ‘Keep him very strictly.’\r\nAnd then, as soon as you are accustomed to look upon the prisoner as a\r\ndangerous man, all of a sudden, without rhyme or reason they write--‘Set\r\nhim at liberty,’ and actually add to their missive--‘urgent.’ You will\r\nown, my lord, ‘tis enough to make a man at dinner shrug his shoulders!”\r\n\r\n“What do you expect? It is for them to write,” said Aramis, “for you to\r\nexecute the order.”\r\n\r\n“Good! good! execute it! Oh, patience! You must not imagine that I am a\r\nslave.”\r\n\r\n“Gracious Heaven! my very good M. Baisemeaux, who ever said so? Your\r\nindependence is well known.”\r\n\r\n“Thank Heaven!”\r\n\r\n“But your goodness of heart is also known.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! don’t speak of it!”\r\n\r\n“And your obedience to your superiors. Once a soldier, you see,\r\nBaisemeaux, always a soldier.”\r\n\r\n“And I shall directly obey; and to-morrow morning, at daybreak, the\r\nprisoner referred to shall be set free.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“At dawn.”\r\n\r\n“Why not this evening, seeing that the _lettre de cachet_ bears, both on\r\nthe direction and inside, ‘_urgent_’?”\r\n\r\n“Because this evening we are at supper, and our affairs are urgent,\r\ntoo!”\r\n\r\n“Dear Baisemeaux, booted though I be, I feel myself a priest, and\r\ncharity has higher claims upon me than hunger and thirst. This\r\nunfortunate man has suffered long enough, since you have just told me\r\nthat he has been your prisoner these ten years. Abridge his suffering.\r\nHis good time has come; give him the benefit quickly. God will repay you\r\nin Paradise with years of felicity.”\r\n\r\n“You wish it?”\r\n\r\n“I entreat you.”\r\n\r\n“What! in the very middle of our repast?”\r\n\r\n“I implore you; such an action is worth ten Benedicites.”\r\n\r\n“It shall be as you desire, only our supper will get cold.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! never heed that.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux leaned back to ring for Francois, and by a very natural\r\nmotion turned round towards the door. The order had remained on the\r\ntable; Aramis seized the opportunity when Baisemeaux was not looking to\r\nchange the paper for another, folded in the same manner, which he drew\r\nswiftly from his pocket. “Francois,” said the governor, “let the major\r\ncome up here with the turnkeys of the Bertaudiere.” Francois bowed and\r\nquitted the room, leaving the two companions alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII. The General of the Order.\r\n\r\nThere was now a brief silence, during which Aramis never removed his\r\neyes from Baisemeaux for a moment. The latter seemed only half decided\r\nto disturb himself thus in the middle of supper, and it was clear he was\r\ntrying to invent some pretext, whether good or bad, for delay, at any\r\nrate till after dessert. And it appeared also that he had hit upon an\r\nexcuse at last.\r\n\r\n“Eh! but it is impossible!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“How impossible?” said Aramis. “Give me a glimpse of this\r\nimpossibility.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis impossible to set a prisoner at liberty at such an hour. Where can\r\nhe go to, a man so unacquainted with Paris?”\r\n\r\n“He will find a place wherever he can.”\r\n\r\n“You see, now, one might as well set a blind man free!”\r\n\r\n“I have a carriage, and will take him wherever he wishes.”\r\n\r\n“You have an answer for everything. Francois, tell monsieur le major to\r\ngo and open the cell of M. Seldon, No. 3, Bertaudiere.”\r\n\r\n“Seldon!” exclaimed Aramis, very naturally. “You said Seldon, I think?”\r\n\r\n“I said Seldon, of course. ‘Tis the name of the man they set free.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you mean to say Marchiali?” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Marchiali? oh! yes, indeed. No, no, Seldon.”\r\n\r\n“I think you are making a mistake, Monsieur Baisemeaux.”\r\n\r\n“I have read the order.”\r\n\r\n“And I also.”\r\n\r\n“And I saw ‘Seldon’ in letters as large as that,” and Baisemeaux held up\r\nhis finger.\r\n\r\n“And I read ‘Marchiali’ in characters as large as this,” said Aramis,\r\nalso holding up two fingers.\r\n\r\n“To the proof; let us throw a light on the matter,” said Baisemeaux,\r\nconfident he was right. “There is the paper, you have only to read it.”\r\n\r\n“I read ‘Marchiali,’” returned Aramis, spreading out the paper. “Look.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux looked, and his arms dropped suddenly. “Yes, yes,” he said,\r\nquite overwhelmed; “yes, Marchiali. ‘Tis plainly written Marchiali!\r\nQuite true!”\r\n\r\n“Ah!--”\r\n\r\n“How? the man of whom we have talked so much? The man whom they are\r\nevery day telling me to take such care of?”\r\n\r\n“There is ‘Marchiali,’” repeated the inflexible Aramis.\r\n\r\n“I must own it, monseigneur. But I understand nothing about it.”\r\n\r\n“You believe your eyes, at any rate.”\r\n\r\n“To tell me very plainly there is ‘Marchiali.’”\r\n\r\n“And in a good handwriting, too.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis a wonder! I still see this order and the name of Seldon, Irishman.\r\nI see it. Ah! I even recollect that under this name there was a blot of\r\nink.”\r\n\r\n“No, there is no ink; no, there is no blot.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! but there was, though; I know it, because I rubbed my finger--this\r\nvery one--in the powder that was over the blot.”\r\n\r\n“In a word, be it how it may, dear M. Baisemeaux,” said Aramis, “and\r\nwhatever you may have seen, the order is signed to release Marchiali,\r\nblot or no blot.”\r\n\r\n“The order is signed to release Marchiali,” replied Baisemeaux,\r\nmechanically, endeavoring to regain his courage.\r\n\r\n“And you are going to release this prisoner. If your heart dictates you\r\nto deliver Seldon also, I declare to you I will not oppose it the least\r\nin the world.” Aramis accompanied this remark with a smile, the irony of\r\nwhich effectually dispelled Baisemeaux’s confusion of mind, and restored\r\nhis courage.\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur,” he said, “this Marchiali is the very same prisoner whom\r\nthe other day a priest confessor of _our order_ came to visit in so\r\nimperious and so secret a manner.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that, monsieur,” replied the bishop.\r\n\r\n“‘Tis no such long time ago, dear Monsieur d’Herblay.”\r\n\r\n“It is true. But _with us_, monsieur, it is good that the man of to-day\r\nshould no longer know what the man of yesterday did.”\r\n\r\n“In any case,” said Baisemeaux, “the visit of the Jesuit confessor must\r\nhave given happiness to this man.”\r\n\r\nAramis made no reply, but recommenced eating and drinking. As for\r\nBaisemeaux, no longer touching anything that was on the table, he again\r\ntook up the order and examined it every way. This investigation, under\r\nordinary circumstances, would have made the ears of the impatient Aramis\r\nburn with anger; but the bishop of Vannes did not become incensed for\r\nso little, above all, when he had murmured to himself that to do so was\r\ndangerous. “Are you going to release Marchiali?” he said. “What mellow,\r\nfragrant and delicious sherry this is, my dear governor.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur,” replied Baisemeaux, “I shall release the prisoner\r\nMarchiali when I have summoned the courier who brought the order, and\r\nabove all, when, by interrogating him, I have satisfied myself.”\r\n\r\n“The order is sealed, and the courier is ignorant of the contents. What\r\ndo you want to satisfy yourself about?”\r\n\r\n“Be it so, monseigneur; but I shall send to the ministry, and M. de\r\nLyonne will either confirm or withdraw the order.”\r\n\r\n“What is the good of all that?” asked Aramis, coldly.\r\n\r\n“What good?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; what is your object, I ask?”\r\n\r\n“The object of never deceiving oneself, monseigneur; nor being wanting\r\nin the respect which a subaltern owes to his superior officers, nor\r\ninfringing the duties of a service one has accepted of one’s own free\r\nwill.”\r\n\r\n“Very good; you have just spoken so eloquently, that I cannot but admire\r\nyou. It is true that a subaltern owes respect to his superiors; he\r\nis guilty when he deceives himself, and he should be punished if he\r\ninfringed either the duties or laws of his office.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux looked at the bishop with astonishment.\r\n\r\n“It follows,” pursued Aramis, “that you are going to ask advice, to put\r\nyour conscience at ease in the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“And if a superior officer gives you orders, you will obey?”\r\n\r\n“Never doubt it, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“You know the king’s signature well, M. de Baisemeaux?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Is it not on this order of release?”\r\n\r\n“It is true, but it may--”\r\n\r\n“Be forged, you mean?”\r\n\r\n“That is evident, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“You are right. And that of M. de Lyonne?”\r\n\r\n“I see it plain enough on the order; but for the same reason that the\r\nking’s signature may have been forged, so also, and with even greater\r\nprobability, may M. de Lyonne’s.”\r\n\r\n“Your logic has the stride of a giant, M. de Baisemeaux,” said Aramis;\r\n“and your reasoning is irresistible. But on what special grounds do you\r\nbase your idea that these signatures are false?”\r\n\r\n“On this: the absence of counter-signatures. Nothing checks his\r\nmajesty’s signature; and M. de Lyonne is not there to tell me he has\r\nsigned.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Monsieur de Baisemeaux,” said Aramis, bending an eagle glance on\r\nthe governor, “I adopt so frankly your doubts, and your mode of clearing\r\nthem up, that I will take a pen, if you will give me one.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux gave him a pen.\r\n\r\n“And a sheet of white paper,” added Aramis.\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux handed him some paper.\r\n\r\n“Now, I--I, also--I, here present--incontestably, I--am going to write\r\nan order to which I am certain you will give credence, incredulous as\r\nyou are!”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux turned pale at this icy assurance of manner. It seemed to\r\nhim that the voice of the bishop’s, but just now so playful and gay, had\r\nbecome funereal and sad; that the wax lights changed into the tapers of\r\na mortuary chapel, the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood.\r\n\r\nAramis took a pen and wrote. Baisemeaux, in terror, read over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“A. M. D. G.,” wrote the bishop; and he drew a cross under these four\r\nletters, which signify _ad majorem Dei gloriam_, “to the greater glory\r\nof God;” and thus he continued: “It is our pleasure that the order\r\nbrought to M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun, governor, for the king, of\r\nthe castle of the Bastile, be held by him good and effectual, and be\r\nimmediately carried into operation.”\r\n\r\n(Signed) D’HERBLAY\r\n\r\n“General of the Order, by the grace of God.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux was so profoundly astonished, that his features remained\r\ncontracted, his lips parted, and his eyes fixed. He did not move an\r\ninch, nor articulate a sound. Nothing could be heard in that large\r\nchamber but the wing-whisper of a little moth, which was fluttering to\r\nits death about the candles. Aramis, without even deigning to look at\r\nthe man whom he had reduced to so miserable a condition, drew from his\r\npocket a small case of black wax; he sealed the letter, and stamped it\r\nwith a seal suspended at his breast, beneath his doublet, and when the\r\noperation was concluded, presented--still in silence--the missive to M.\r\nde Baisemeaux. The latter, whose hands trembled in a manner to excite\r\npity, turned a dull and meaningless gaze upon the letter. A last gleam\r\nof feeling played over his features, and he fell, as if thunder-struck,\r\non a chair.\r\n\r\n“Come, come,” said Aramis, after a long silence, during which the\r\ngovernor of the Bastile had slowly recovered his senses, “do not lead\r\nme to believe, dear Baisemeaux, that the presence of the general of the\r\norder is as terrible as His, and that men die merely from having seen\r\nHim. Take courage, rouse yourself; give me your hand--obey.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux, reassured, if not satisfied, obeyed, kissed Aramis’s hand,\r\nand rose. “Immediately?” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Oh, there is no pressing haste, my host; take your place again, and do\r\nthe honors over this beautiful dessert.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, I shall never recover such a shock as this; I who have\r\nlaughed, who have jested with you! I who have dared to treat you on a\r\nfooting of equality!”\r\n\r\n“Say nothing about it, old comrade,” replied the bishop, who perceived\r\nhow strained the cord was and how dangerous it would have been to break\r\nit; “say nothing about it. Let us each live in our own way; to you,\r\nmy protection and my friendship; to me, your obedience. Having exactly\r\nfulfilled these two requirements, let us live happily.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux reflected; he perceived, at a glance, the consequence of this\r\nwithdrawal of a prisoner by means of a forged order; and, putting in the\r\nscale the guarantee offered him by the official order of the general,\r\ndid not consider it of any value.\r\n\r\nAramis divined this. “My dear Baisemeaux,” said he, “you are a\r\nsimpleton. Lose this habit of reflection when I give myself the trouble\r\nto think for you.”\r\n\r\nAnd at another gesture he made, Baisemeaux bowed again. “How shall I set\r\nabout it?” he said.\r\n\r\n“What is the process for releasing a prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“I have the regulations.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, follow the regulations, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“I go with my major to the prisoner’s room, and conduct him, if he is a\r\npersonage of importance.”\r\n\r\n“But this Marchiali is not an important personage,” said Aramis\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” answered the governor, as if he would have said, “It is\r\nfor you to instruct me.”\r\n\r\n“Then if you don’t know it, I am right; so act towards Marchiali as you\r\nact towards one of obscure station.”\r\n\r\n“Good; the regulations so provide. They are to the effect that the\r\nturnkey, or one of the lower officials, shall bring the prisoner before\r\nthe governor, in the office.”\r\n\r\n“Well, ‘tis very wise, that; and then?”\r\n\r\n“Then we return to the prisoner the valuables he wore at the time of his\r\nimprisonment, his clothes and papers, if the minister’s orders have not\r\notherwise dictated.”\r\n\r\n“What was the minister’s order as to this Marchiali?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing; for the unhappy man arrived here without jewels, without\r\npapers, and almost without clothes.”\r\n\r\n“See how simple, then, all is. Indeed, Baisemeaux, you make a mountain\r\nof everything. Remain here, and make them bring the prisoner to the\r\ngovernor’s house.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux obeyed. He summoned his lieutenant, and gave him an order,\r\nwhich the latter passed on, without disturbing himself about it, to the\r\nnext whom it concerned.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterwards they heard a gate shut in the court; it was the\r\ndoor to the dungeon, which had just rendered up its prey to the free\r\nair. Aramis blew out all the candles which lighted the room but one,\r\nwhich he left burning behind the door. This flickering glare prevented\r\nthe sight from resting steadily on any object. It multiplied tenfold the\r\nchanging forms and shadows of the place, by its wavering uncertainty.\r\nSteps drew near.\r\n\r\n“Go and meet your men,” said Aramis to Baisemeaux.\r\n\r\nThe governor obeyed. The sergeant and turnkeys disappeared. Baisemeaux\r\nre-entered, followed by a prisoner. Aramis had placed himself in the\r\nshade; he saw without being seen. Baisemeaux, in an agitated tone of\r\nvoice, made the young man acquainted with the order which set him at\r\nliberty. The prisoner listened, without making a single gesture or\r\nsaying a word.\r\n\r\n“You will swear [‘tis the regulation that requires it),” added the\r\ngovernor, “never to reveal anything that you have seen or heard in the\r\nBastile.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner perceived a crucifix; he stretched out his hands and swore\r\nwith his lips. “And now, monsieur, you are free. Whither do you intend\r\ngoing?”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner turned his head, as if looking behind him for some\r\nprotection, on which he ought to rely. Then was it that Aramis came out\r\nof the shade: “I am here,” he said, “to render the gentleman whatever\r\nservice he may please to ask.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner slightly reddened, and, without hesitation, passed his arm\r\nthrough that of Aramis. “God have you in his holy keeping,” he said, in\r\na voice the firmness of which made the governor tremble as much as the\r\nform of the blessing astonished him.\r\n\r\nAramis, on shaking hands with Baisemeaux, said to him; “Does my order\r\ntrouble you? Do you fear their finding it here, should they come to\r\nsearch?”\r\n\r\n“I desire to keep it, monseigneur,” said Baisemeaux. “If they found it\r\nhere, it would be a certain indication I should be lost, and in that\r\ncase you would be a powerful and a last auxiliary for me.”\r\n\r\n“Being your accomplice, you mean?” answered Aramis, shrugging his\r\nshoulders. “Adieu, Baisemeaux,” said he.\r\n\r\nThe horses were in waiting, making each rusty spring reverberate the\r\ncarriage again with their impatience. Baisemeaux accompanied the bishop\r\nto the bottom of the steps. Aramis caused his companion to mount before\r\nhim, then followed, and without giving the driver any further order, “Go\r\non,” said he. The carriage rattled over the pavement of the courtyard.\r\nAn officer with a torch went before the horses, and gave orders at\r\nevery post to let them pass. During the time taken in opening all the\r\nbarriers, Aramis barely breathed, and you might have heard his “sealed\r\nheart knock against his ribs.” The prisoner, buried in a corner of the\r\ncarriage, made no more sign of life than his companion. At length, a\r\njolt more sever than the others announced to them that they had cleared\r\nthe last watercourse. Behind the carriage closed the last gate, that\r\nin the Rue St. Antoine. No more walls either on the right or the left;\r\nheaven everywhere, liberty everywhere, and life everywhere. The horses,\r\nkept in check by a vigorous hand, went quietly as far as the middle of\r\nthe faubourg. There they began to trot. Little by little, whether they\r\nwere warming to their work, or whether they were urged, they gained in\r\nswiftness, and once past Bercy, the carriage seemed to fly, so great was\r\nthe ardor of the coursers. The horses galloped thus as far as Villeneuve\r\nSt. George’s, where relays were waiting. Then four instead of two\r\nwhirled the carriage away in the direction of Melun, and pulled up for\r\na moment in the middle of the forest of Senart. No doubt the order had\r\nbeen given the postilion beforehand, for Aramis had no occasion even to\r\nmake a sign.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked the prisoner, as if waking from a long\r\ndream.\r\n\r\n“The matter is, monseigneur,” said Aramis, “that before going further,\r\nit is necessary your royal highness and I should converse.”\r\n\r\n“I will await an opportunity, monsieur,” answered the young prince.\r\n\r\n“We could not have a better, monseigneur. We are in the middle of a\r\nforest, and no one can hear us.”\r\n\r\n“The postilion?”\r\n\r\n“The postilion of this relay is deaf and dumb, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“I am at your service, M. d’Herblay.”\r\n\r\n“Is it your pleasure to remain in the carriage?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; we are comfortably seated, and I like this carriage, for it has\r\nrestored me to liberty.”\r\n\r\n“Wait, monseigneur; there is yet a precaution to be taken.”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“We are here on the highway; cavaliers or carriages traveling\r\nlike ourselves might pass, and seeing us stopping, deem us in some\r\ndifficulty. Let us avoid offers of assistance, which would embarrass\r\nus.”\r\n\r\n“Give the postilion orders to conceal the carriage in one of the side\r\navenues.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis exactly what I wished to do, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\nAramis made a sign to the deaf and dumb driver of the carriage, whom\r\nhe touched on the arm. The latter dismounted, took the leaders by the\r\nbridle, and led them over the velvet sward and the mossy grass of a\r\nwinding alley, at the bottom of which, on this moonless night, the deep\r\nshades formed a curtain blacker than ink. This done, the man lay down\r\non a slope near his horses, who, on either side, kept nibbling the young\r\noak shoots.\r\n\r\n“I am listening,” said the young prince to Aramis; “but what are you\r\ndoing there?”\r\n\r\n“I am disarming myself of my pistols, of which we have no further need,\r\nmonseigneur.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX. The Tempter.\r\n\r\n“My prince,” said Aramis, turning in the carriage towards his companion,\r\n“weak creature as I am, so unpretending in genius, so low in the scale\r\nof intelligent beings, it has never yet happened to me to converse with\r\na man without penetrating his thoughts through that living mask which\r\nhas been thrown over our mind, in order to retain its expression. But\r\nto-night, in this darkness, in the reserve which you maintain, I can\r\nread nothing on your features, and something tells me that I shall have\r\ngreat difficulty in wresting from you a sincere declaration. I beseech\r\nyou, then, not for love of me, for subjects should never weigh as\r\nanything in the balance which princes hold, but for love of yourself,\r\nto retain every syllable, every inflexion which, under the present most\r\ngrave circumstances, will all have a sense and value as important as any\r\nevery uttered in the world.”\r\n\r\n“I listen,” replied the young prince, “decidedly, without either eagerly\r\nseeking or fearing anything you are about to say to me.” And he buried\r\nhimself still deeper in the thick cushions of the carriage, trying to\r\ndeprive his companion not only of the sight of him, but even of the very\r\nidea of his presence.\r\n\r\nBlack was the darkness which fell wide and dense from the summits of the\r\nintertwining trees. The carriage, covered in by this prodigious roof,\r\nwould not have received a particle of light, not even if a ray could\r\nhave struggled through the wreaths of mist that were already rising in\r\nthe avenue.\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur,” resumed Aramis, “you know the history of the government\r\nwhich to-day controls France. The king issued from an infancy imprisoned\r\nlike yours, obscure as yours, and confined as yours; only, instead\r\nof ending, like yourself, this slavery in a prison, this obscurity in\r\nsolitude, these straightened circumstances in concealment, he was\r\nfain to bear all these miseries, humiliations, and distresses, in full\r\ndaylight, under the pitiless sun of royalty; on an elevation flooded\r\nwith light, where every stain appears a blemish, every glory a stain.\r\nThe king has suffered; it rankles in his mind; and he will avenge\r\nhimself. He will be a bad king. I say not that he will pour out his\r\npeople’s blood, like Louis XI., or Charles IX.; for he has no mortal\r\ninjuries to avenge; but he will devour the means and substance of his\r\npeople; for he has himself undergone wrongs in his own interest and\r\nmoney. In the first place, then, I acquit my conscience, when I consider\r\nopenly the merits and the faults of this great prince; and if I condemn\r\nhim, my conscience absolves me.”\r\n\r\nAramis paused. It was not to listen if the silence of the forest\r\nremained undisturbed, but it was to gather up his thoughts from the very\r\nbottom of his soul--to leave the thoughts he had uttered sufficient time\r\nto eat deeply into the mind of his companion.\r\n\r\n“All that Heaven does, Heaven does well,” continued the bishop of\r\nVannes; “and I am so persuaded of it that I have long been thankful\r\nto have been chosen depositary of the secret which I have aided you\r\nto discover. To a just Providence was necessary an instrument, at once\r\npenetrating, persevering, and convinced, to accomplish a great work. I\r\nam this instrument. I possess penetration, perseverance, conviction; I\r\ngovern a mysterious people, who has taken for its motto, the motto\r\nof God, ‘_Patiens quia oeternus_.’” The prince moved. “I divine,\r\nmonseigneur, why you are raising your head, and are surprised at the\r\npeople I have under my command. You did not know you were dealing with a\r\nking--oh! monseigneur, king of a people very humble, much disinherited;\r\nhumble because they have no force save when creeping; disinherited,\r\nbecause never, almost never in this world, do my people reap the harvest\r\nthey sow, nor eat the fruit they cultivate. They labor for an abstract\r\nidea; they heap together all the atoms of their power, so from a single\r\nman; and round this man, with the sweat of their labor, they create a\r\nmisty halo, which his genius shall, in turn, render a glory gilded with\r\nthe rays of all the crowns in Christendom. Such is the man you have\r\nbeside you, monseigneur. It is to tell you that he has drawn you from\r\nthe abyss for a great purpose, to raise you above the powers of the\r\nearth--above himself.” [1]\r\n\r\nThe prince lightly touched Aramis’s arm. “You speak to me,” he said,\r\n“of that religious order whose chief you are. For me, the result of your\r\nwords is, that the day you desire to hurl down the man you shall have\r\nraised, the event will be accomplished; and that you will keep under\r\nyour hand your creation of yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Undeceive yourself, monseigneur,” replied the bishop. “I should not\r\ntake the trouble to play this terrible game with your royal highness, if\r\nI had not a double interest in gaining it. The day you are elevated, you\r\nare elevated forever; you will overturn the footstool, as you rise, and\r\nwill send it rolling so far, that not even the sight of it will ever\r\nagain recall to you its right to simple gratitude.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, monsieur!”\r\n\r\n“Your movement, monseigneur, arises from an excellent disposition.\r\nI thank you. Be well assured, I aspire to more than gratitude! I am\r\nconvinced that, when arrived at the summit, you will judge me still more\r\nworthy to be your friend; and then, monseigneur, we two will do such\r\ngreat deeds, that ages hereafter shall long speak of them.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me plainly, monsieur--tell me without disguise--what I am to-day,\r\nand what you aim at my being to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“You are the son of King Louis XIII., brother of Louis XIV., natural\r\nand legitimate heir to the throne of France. In keeping you near him,\r\nas Monsieur has been kept--Monsieur, your younger brother--the king\r\nreserved to himself the right of being legitimate sovereign. The doctors\r\nonly could dispute his legitimacy. But the doctors always prefer the\r\nking who is to the king who is not. Providence has willed that you\r\nshould be persecuted; this persecution to-day consecrates you king of\r\nFrance. You had, then, a right to reign, seeing that it is disputed; you\r\nhad a right to be proclaimed seeing that you have been concealed; and\r\nyou possess royal blood, since no one has dared to shed yours, as that\r\nof your servants has been shed. Now see, then, what this Providence,\r\nwhich you have so often accused of having in every way thwarted you, has\r\ndone for you. It has given you the features, figure, age, and voice\r\nof your brother; and the very causes of your persecution are about\r\nto become those of your triumphant restoration. To-morrow, after\r\nto-morrow--from the very first, regal phantom, living shade of Louis\r\nXIV., you will sit upon his throne, whence the will of Heaven, confided\r\nin execution to the arm of man, will have hurled him, without hope of\r\nreturn.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” said the prince, “my brother’s blood will not be shed,\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\n“You will be sole arbiter of his fate.”\r\n\r\n“The secret of which they made an evil use against me?”\r\n\r\n“You will employ it against him. What did he do to conceal it? He\r\nconcealed you. Living image of himself, you will defeat the conspiracy\r\nof Mazarin and Anne of Austria. You, my prince, will have the same\r\ninterest in concealing him, who will, as a prisoner, resemble you, as\r\nyou will resemble him as a king.”\r\n\r\n“I fall back on what I was saying to you. Who will guard him?”\r\n\r\n“Who guarded _you?_”\r\n\r\n“You know this secret--you have made use of it with regard to myself.\r\nWho else knows it?”\r\n\r\n“The queen-mother and Madame de Chevreuse.”\r\n\r\n“What will they do?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, if you choose.”\r\n\r\n“How is that?”\r\n\r\n“How can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can\r\nrecognize you?”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis true; but there are grave difficulties.”\r\n\r\n“State them, prince.”\r\n\r\n“My brother is married; I cannot take my brother’s wife.”\r\n\r\n“I will cause Spain to consent to a divorce; it is in the interest of\r\nyour new policy; it is human morality. All that is really noble and\r\nreally useful in this world will find its account therein.”\r\n\r\n“The imprisoned king will speak.”\r\n\r\n“To whom do you think he will speak--to the walls?”\r\n\r\n“You mean, by walls, the men in whom you put confidence.”\r\n\r\n“If need be, yes. And besides, your royal highness--”\r\n\r\n“Besides?”\r\n\r\n“I was going to say, that the designs of Providence do not stop on such\r\na fair road. Every scheme of this caliber is completed by its results,\r\nlike a geometrical calculation. The king, in prison, will not be for you\r\nthe cause of embarrassment that you have been for the king enthroned.\r\nHis soul is naturally proud and impatient; it is, moreover, disarmed and\r\nenfeebled, by being accustomed to honors, and by the license of supreme\r\npower. The same Providence which has willed that the concluding step in\r\nthe geometrical calculation I have had the honor of describing to\r\nyour royal highness should be your ascension to the throne, and the\r\ndestruction of him who is hurtful to you, has also determined that\r\nthe conquered one shall soon end both his own and your sufferings.\r\nTherefore, his soul and body have been adapted for but a brief agony.\r\nPut into prison as a private individual, left alone with your doubts,\r\ndeprived of everything, you have exhibited the most sublime, enduring\r\nprinciple of life in withstanding all this. But your brother, a captive,\r\nforgotten, and in bonds, will not long endure the calamity; and Heaven\r\nwill resume his soul at the appointed time--that is to say, soon.”\r\n\r\nAt this point in Aramis’s gloomy analysis, a bird of night uttered from\r\nthe depths of the forest that prolonged and plaintive cry which makes\r\nevery creature tremble.\r\n\r\n“I will exile the deposed king,” said Philippe, shuddering; “‘twill be\r\nmore human.”\r\n\r\n“The king’s good pleasure will decide the point,” said Aramis. “But has\r\nthe problem been well put? Have I brought out of the solution according\r\nto the wishes or the foresight of your royal highness?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur, yes; you have forgotten nothing--except, indeed, two\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\n“The first?”\r\n\r\n“Let us speak of it at once, with the same frankness we have already\r\nconversed in. Let us speak of the causes which may bring about the ruin\r\nof all the hopes we have conceived. Let us speak of the risks we are\r\nrunning.”\r\n\r\n“They would be immense, infinite, terrific, insurmountable, if, as I\r\nhave said, all things did not concur to render them of absolutely no\r\naccount. There is no danger either for you or for me, if the constancy\r\nand intrepidity of your royal highness are equal to that perfection of\r\nresemblance to your brother which nature has bestowed upon you. I repeat\r\nit, there are no dangers, only obstacles; a word, indeed, which I find\r\nin all languages, but have always ill-understood, and, were I king,\r\nwould have obliterated as useless and absurd.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed, monsieur; there is a very serious obstacle, an\r\ninsurmountable danger, which you are forgetting.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“There is conscience, which cries aloud; remorse, that never dies.”\r\n\r\n“True, true,” said the bishop; “there is a weakness of heart of which\r\nyou remind me. You are right, too, for that, indeed, is an immense\r\nobstacle. The horse afraid of the ditch, leaps into the middle of it,\r\nand is killed! The man who trembling crosses his sword with that of\r\nanother leaves loopholes whereby his enemy has him in his power.”\r\n\r\n“Have you a brother?” said the young man to Aramis.\r\n\r\n“I am alone in the world,” said the latter, with a hard, dry voice.\r\n\r\n“But, surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?” added\r\nPhilippe.\r\n\r\n“No one!--Yes, I love you.”\r\n\r\nThe young man sank into so profound a silence, that the mere sound of\r\nhis respiration seemed like a roaring tumult for Aramis. “Monseigneur,”\r\n he resumed, “I have not said all I had to say to your royal highness;\r\nI have not offered you all the salutary counsels and useful resources\r\nwhich I have at my disposal. It is useless to flash bright visions\r\nbefore the eyes of one who seeks and loves darkness: useless, too, is\r\nit to let the magnificence of the cannon’s roar make itself heard in the\r\nears of one who loves repose and the quiet of the country. Monseigneur,\r\nI have your happiness spread out before me in my thoughts; listen to my\r\nwords; precious they indeed are, in their import and their sense,\r\nfor you who look with such tender regard upon the bright heavens, the\r\nverdant meadows, the pure air. I know a country instinct with\r\ndelights of every kind, an unknown paradise, a secluded corner of the\r\nworld--where alone, unfettered and unknown, in the thick covert of the\r\nwoods, amidst flowers, and streams of rippling water, you will forget\r\nall the misery that human folly has so recently allotted you. Oh! listen\r\nto me, my prince. I do not jest. I have a heart, and mind, and soul, and\r\ncan read your own,--aye, even to its depths. I will not take you unready\r\nfor your task, in order to cast you into the crucible of my own desires,\r\nof my caprice, or my ambition. Let it be all or nothing. You are chilled\r\nand galled, sick at heart, overcome by excess of the emotions which but\r\none hour’s liberty has produced in you. For me, that is a certain and\r\nunmistakable sign that you do not wish to continue at liberty. Would you\r\nprefer a more humble life, a life more suited to your strength? Heaven\r\nis my witness, that I wish your happiness to be the result of the trial\r\nto which I have exposed you.”\r\n\r\n“Speak, speak,” said the prince, with a vivacity which did not escape\r\nAramis.\r\n\r\n“I know,” resumed the prelate, “in the Bas-Poitou, a canton, of which\r\nno one in France suspects the existence. Twenty leagues of country is\r\nimmense, is it not? Twenty leagues, monseigneur, all covered with water\r\nand herbage, and reeds of the most luxuriant nature; the whole studded\r\nwith islands covered with woods of the densest foliage. These large\r\nmarshes, covered with reeds as with a thick mantle, sleep silently and\r\ncalmly beneath the sun’s soft and genial rays. A few fishermen with\r\ntheir families indolently pass their lives away there, with their great\r\nliving-rafts of poplar and alder, the flooring formed of reeds, and the\r\nroof woven out of thick rushes. These barks, these floating-houses, are\r\nwafted to and fro by the changing winds. Whenever they touch a bank, it\r\nis but by chance; and so gently, too, that the sleeping fisherman is not\r\nawakened by the shock. Should he wish to land, it is merely because he\r\nhas seen a large flight of landrails or plovers, of wild ducks, teal,\r\nwidgeon, or woodchucks, which fall an easy pray to net or gun. Silver\r\nshad, eels, greedy pike, red and gray mullet, swim in shoals into his\r\nnets; he has but to choose the finest and largest, and return the others\r\nto the waters. Never yet has the food of the stranger, be he soldier\r\nor simple citizen, never has any one, indeed, penetrated into that\r\ndistrict. The sun’s rays there are soft and tempered: in plots of solid\r\nearth, whose soil is swart and fertile, grows the vine, nourishing with\r\ngenerous juice its purple, white, and golden grapes. Once a week, a boat\r\nis sent to deliver the bread which has been baked at an oven--the common\r\nproperty of all. There--like the seigneurs of early days--powerful in\r\nvirtue of your dogs, your fishing-lines, your guns, and your beautiful\r\nreed-built house, would you live, rich in the produce of the chase,\r\nin plentitude of absolute secrecy. There would years of your life roll\r\naway, at the end of which, no longer recognizable, for you would have\r\nbeen perfectly transformed, you would have succeeded in acquiring a\r\ndestiny accorded to you by Heaven. There are a thousand pistoles in this\r\nbag, monseigneur--more, far more, than sufficient to purchase the whole\r\nmarsh of which I have spoken; more than enough to live there as many\r\nyears as you have days to live; more than enough to constitute you the\r\nrichest, the freest, and the happiest man in the country. Accept it,\r\nas I offer it you--sincerely, cheerfully. Forthwith, without a moment’s\r\npause, I will unharness two of my horses, which are attached to the\r\ncarriage yonder, and they, accompanied by my servant--my deaf and dumb\r\nattendant--shall conduct you--traveling throughout the night, sleeping\r\nduring the day--to the locality I have described; and I shall, at least,\r\nhave the satisfaction of knowing that I have rendered to my prince the\r\nmajor service he himself preferred. I shall have made one human being\r\nhappy; and Heaven for that will hold me in better account than if I had\r\nmade one man powerful; the former task is far more difficult. And now,\r\nmonseigneur, your answer to this proposition? Here is the money. Nay,\r\ndo not hesitate. At Poitou, you can risk nothing, except the chance of\r\ncatching the fevers prevalent there; and even of them, the so-called\r\nwizards of the country will cure you, for the sake of your pistoles. If\r\nyou play the other game, you run the chance of being assassinated on a\r\nthrone, strangled in a prison-cell. Upon my soul, I assure you, now I\r\nbegin to compare them together, I myself should hesitate which lot I\r\nshould accept.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied the young prince, “before I determine, let me alight\r\nfrom this carriage, walk on the ground, and consult that still voice\r\nwithin me, which Heaven bids us all to hearken to. Ten minutes is all I\r\nask, and then you shall have your answer.”\r\n\r\n“As you please, monseigneur,” said Aramis, bending before him with\r\nrespect, so solemn and august in tone and address had sounded these\r\nstrange words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X. Crown and Tiara.\r\n\r\nAramis was the first to descend from the carriage; he held the door open\r\nfor the young man. He saw him place his foot on the mossy ground with\r\na trembling of the whole body, and walk round the carriage with an\r\nunsteady and almost tottering step. It seemed as if the poor prisoner\r\nwas unaccustomed to walk on God’s earth. It was the 15th of August,\r\nabout eleven o’clock at night; thick clouds, portending a tempest,\r\noverspread the heavens, and shrouded every light and prospect underneath\r\ntheir heavy folds. The extremities of the avenues were imperceptibly\r\ndetached from the copse, by a lighter shadow of opaque gray, which, upon\r\ncloser examination, became visible in the midst of the obscurity.\r\nBut the fragrance which ascended from the grass, fresher and more\r\npenetrating than that which exhaled from the trees around him; the warm\r\nand balmy air which enveloped him for the first time for many years\r\npast; the ineffable enjoyment of liberty in an open country, spoke\r\nto the prince in so seductive a language, that notwithstanding the\r\npreternatural caution, we would almost say dissimulation of his\r\ncharacter, of which we have tried to give an idea, he could not restrain\r\nhis emotion, and breathed a sigh of ecstasy. Then, by degrees, he raised\r\nhis aching head and inhaled the softly scented air, as it was wafted in\r\ngentle gusts to his uplifted face. Crossing his arms on his chest, as if\r\nto control this new sensation of delight, he drank in delicious draughts\r\nof that mysterious air which interpenetrates at night the loftiest\r\nforests. The sky he was contemplating, the murmuring waters, the\r\nuniversal freshness--was not all this reality? Was not Aramis a madman\r\nto suppose that he had aught else to dream of in this world? Those\r\nexciting pictures of country life, so free from fears and troubles,\r\nthe ocean of happy days that glitters incessantly before all young\r\nimaginations, are real allurements wherewith to fascinate a poor,\r\nunhappy prisoner, worn out by prison cares, emaciated by the stifling\r\nair of the Bastile. It was the picture, it will be remembered, drawn\r\nby Aramis, when he offered the thousand pistoles he had with him in\r\nthe carriage to the prince, and the enchanted Eden which the deserts of\r\nBas-Poitou hid from the eyes of the world. Such were the reflections of\r\nAramis as he watched, with an anxiety impossible to describe, the\r\nsilent progress of the emotions of Philippe, whom he perceived gradually\r\nbecoming more and more absorbed in his meditations. The young prince was\r\noffering up an inward prayer to Heaven, to be divinely guided in this\r\ntrying moment, upon which his life or death depended. It was an anxious\r\ntime for the bishop of Vannes, who had never before been so perplexed.\r\nHis iron will, accustomed to overcome all obstacles, never finding\r\nitself inferior or vanquished on any occasion, to be foiled in so vast a\r\nproject from not having foreseen the influence which a view of nature in\r\nall its luxuriance would have on the human mind! Aramis, overwhelmed by\r\nanxiety, contemplated with emotion the painful struggle that was taking\r\nplace in Philippe’s mind. This suspense lasted the whole ten minutes\r\nwhich the young man had requested. During this space of time, which\r\nappeared an eternity, Philippe continued gazing with an imploring and\r\nsorrowful look towards the heavens; Aramis did not remove the piercing\r\nglance he had fixed on Philippe. Suddenly the young man bowed his head.\r\nHis thought returned to the earth, his looks perceptibly hardened, his\r\nbrow contracted, his mouth assuming an expression of undaunted courage;\r\nagain his looks became fixed, but this time they wore a worldly\r\nexpression, hardened by covetousness, pride, and strong desire. Aramis’s\r\nlook immediately became as soft as it had before been gloomy. Philippe,\r\nseizing his hand in a quick, agitated manner, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Lead me to where the crown of France is to be found.”\r\n\r\n“Is this your decision, monseigneur?” asked Aramis.\r\n\r\n“It is.”\r\n\r\n“Irrevocably so?”\r\n\r\nPhilippe did not even deign to reply. He gazed earnestly at the bishop,\r\nas if to ask him if it were possible for a man to waver after having\r\nonce made up his mind.\r\n\r\n“Such looks are flashes of the hidden fire that betrays men’s\r\ncharacter,” said Aramis, bowing over Philippe’s hand; “you will be\r\ngreat, monseigneur, I will answer for that.”\r\n\r\n“Let us resume our conversation. I wished to discuss two points with\r\nyou; in the first place the dangers, or the obstacles we may meet with.\r\nThat point is decided. The other is the conditions you intend imposing\r\non me. It is your turn to speak, M. d’Herblay.”\r\n\r\n“The conditions, monseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless. You will not allow so mere a trifle to stop me, and you will\r\nnot do me the injustice to suppose that I think you have no interest in\r\nthis affair. Therefore, without subterfuge or hesitation, tell me the\r\ntruth--”\r\n\r\n“I will do so, monseigneur. Once a king--”\r\n\r\n“When will that be?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow evening--I mean in the night.”\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself.”\r\n\r\n“When I shall have asked your highness a question.”\r\n\r\n“Do so.”\r\n\r\n“I sent to your highness a man in my confidence with instructions to\r\ndeliver some closely written notes, carefully drawn up, which will\r\nthoroughly acquaint your highness with the different persons who compose\r\nand will compose your court.”\r\n\r\n“I perused those notes.”\r\n\r\n“Attentively?”\r\n\r\n“I know them by heart.”\r\n\r\n“And understand them? Pardon me, but I may venture to ask that question\r\nof a poor, abandoned captive of the Bastile? In a week’s time it will\r\nnot be requisite to further question a mind like yours. You will then be\r\nin full possession of liberty and power.”\r\n\r\n“Interrogate me, then, and I will be a scholar representing his lesson\r\nto his master.”\r\n\r\n“We will begin with your family, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“My mother, Anne of Austria! all her sorrows, her painful malady. Oh! I\r\nknow her--I know her.”\r\n\r\n“Your second brother?” asked Aramis, bowing.\r\n\r\n“To these notes,” replied the prince, “you have added portraits so\r\nfaithfully painted, that I am able to recognize the persons whose\r\ncharacters, manners, and history you have so carefully portrayed.\r\nMonsieur, my brother, is a fine, dark young man, with a pale face; he\r\ndoes not love his wife, Henrietta, whom I, Louis XIV., loved a little,\r\nand still flirt with, even although she made me weep on the day she\r\nwished to dismiss Mademoiselle de la Vallière from her service in\r\ndisgrace.”\r\n\r\n“You will have to be careful with regard to the watchfulness of the\r\nlatter,” said Aramis; “she is sincerely attached to the actual king. The\r\neyes of a woman who loves are not easily deceived.”\r\n\r\n“She is fair, has blue eyes, whose affectionate gaze reveals her\r\nidentity. She halts slightly in her gait; she writes a letter every day,\r\nto which I have to send an answer by M. de Saint-Aignan.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the latter?”\r\n\r\n“As if I saw him, and I know the last verses he composed for me, as well\r\nas those I composed in answer to his.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. Do you know your ministers?”\r\n\r\n“Colbert, an ugly, dark-browed man, but intelligent enough, his hair\r\ncovering his forehead, a large, heavy, full head; the mortal enemy of M.\r\nFouquet.”\r\n\r\n“As for the latter, we need not disturb ourselves about him.”\r\n\r\n“No; because necessarily you will not require me to exile him, I\r\nsuppose?”\r\n\r\nAramis, struck with admiration at the remark, said, “You will become\r\nvery great, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“You see,” added the prince, “that I know my lesson by heart, and with\r\nHeaven’s assistance, and yours afterwards, I shall seldom go wrong.”\r\n\r\n“You have still an awkward pair of eyes to deal with, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, the captain of the musketeers, M. d’Artagnan, your friend.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I can well say ‘my friend.’”\r\n\r\n“He who escorted La Vallière to Le Chaillot; he who delivered up Monk,\r\ncooped in an iron box, to Charles II.; he who so faithfully served\r\nmy mother; he to whom the crown of France owes so much that it owes\r\neverything. Do you intend to ask me to exile him also?”\r\n\r\n“Never, sire. D’Artagnan is a man to whom, at a certain given time, I\r\nwill undertake to reveal everything; but be on your guard with him, for\r\nif he discovers our plot before it is revealed to him, you or I will\r\ncertainly be killed or taken. He is a bold and enterprising man.”\r\n\r\n“I will think it over. Now tell me about M. Fouquet; what do you wish to\r\nbe done with regard to him?”\r\n\r\n“One moment more, I entreat you, monseigneur; and forgive me, if I seem\r\nto fail in respect to questioning you further.”\r\n\r\n“It is your duty to do so, nay, more than that, your right.”\r\n\r\n“Before we pass to M. Fouquet, I should very much regret forgetting\r\nanother friend of mine.”\r\n\r\n“M. du Vallon, the Hercules of France, you mean; oh! as far as he is\r\nconcerned, his interests are more than safe.”\r\n\r\n“No; it is not he whom I intended to refer to.”\r\n\r\n“The Comte de la Fere, then?”\r\n\r\n“And his son, the son of all four of us.”\r\n\r\n“That poor boy who is dying of love for La Vallière, whom my brother\r\nso disloyally bereft him of? Be easy on that score. I shall know how to\r\nrehabilitate his happiness. Tell me only one thing, Monsieur d’Herblay;\r\ndo men, when they love, forget the treachery that has been shown them?\r\nCan a man ever forgive the woman who has betrayed him? Is that a French\r\ncustom, or is it one of the laws of the human heart?”\r\n\r\n“A man who loves deeply, as deeply as Raoul loves Mademoiselle de la\r\nVallière, finishes by forgetting the fault or crime of the woman he\r\nloves; but I do not yet know whether Raoul will be able to forget.”\r\n\r\n“I will see after that. Have you anything further to say about your\r\nfriend?”\r\n\r\n“No; that is all.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, now for M. Fouquet. What do you wish me to do for him?”\r\n\r\n“To keep him on as surintendant, in the capacity in which he has\r\nhitherto acted, I entreat you.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so; but he is the first minister at present.”\r\n\r\n“Not quite so.”\r\n\r\n“A king, ignorant and embarrassed as I shall be, will, as a matter of\r\ncourse, require a first minister of state.”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty will require a friend.”\r\n\r\n“I have only one, and that is yourself.”\r\n\r\n“You will have many others by and by, but none so devoted, none so\r\nzealous for your glory.”\r\n\r\n“You shall be my first minister of state.”\r\n\r\n“Not immediately, monseigneur, for that would give rise to too much\r\nsuspicion and astonishment.”\r\n\r\n“M. de Richelieu, the first minister of my grandmother, Marie de Medici,\r\nwas simply bishop of Lucon, as you are bishop of Vannes.”\r\n\r\n“I perceive that your royal highness has studied my notes to great\r\nadvantage; your amazing perspicacity overpowers me with delight.”\r\n\r\n“I am perfectly aware that M. de Richelieu, by means of the queen’s\r\nprotection, soon became cardinal.”\r\n\r\n“It would be better,” said Aramis, bowing, “that I should not be\r\nappointed first minister until your royal highness has procured my\r\nnomination as cardinal.”\r\n\r\n“You shall be nominated before two months are past, Monsieur d’Herblay.\r\nBut that is a matter of very trifling moment; you would not offend me if\r\nyou were to ask more than that, and you would cause me serious regret if\r\nyou were to limit yourself to that.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, I have something still further to hope for, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Speak! speak!”\r\n\r\n“M. Fouquet will not keep long at the head of affairs, he will soon get\r\nold. He is fond of pleasure, consistently, I mean, with all his labors,\r\nthanks to the youthfulness he still retains; but this protracted youth\r\nwill disappear at the approach of the first serious annoyance, or at\r\nthe first illness he may experience. We will spare him the annoyance,\r\nbecause he is an agreeable and noble-hearted man; but we cannot save him\r\nfrom ill-health. So it is determined. When you shall have paid all M.\r\nFouquet’s debts, and restored the finances to a sound condition, M.\r\nFouquet will be able to remain the sovereign ruler in his little court\r\nof poets and painters,--we shall have made him rich. When that has been\r\ndone, and I have become your royal highness’s prime minister, I shall be\r\nable to think of my own interests and yours.”\r\n\r\nThe young man looked at his interrogator.\r\n\r\n“M. de Richelieu, of whom we were speaking just now, was very much to\r\nblame in the fixed idea he had of governing France alone, unaided. He\r\nallowed two kings, King Louis XIII. and himself, to be seated on the\r\nself-same throne, whilst he might have installed them more conveniently\r\nupon two separate and distinct thrones.”\r\n\r\n“Upon two thrones?” said the young man, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“In fact,” pursued Aramis, quietly, “a cardinal, prime minister of\r\nFrance, assisted by the favor and by the countenance of his Most\r\nChristian Majesty the King of France, a cardinal to whom the king his\r\nmaster lends the treasures of the state, his army, his counsel, such\r\na man would be acting with twofold injustice in applying these mighty\r\nresources to France alone. Besides,” added Aramis, “you will not be a\r\nking such as your father was, delicate in health, slow in judgment, whom\r\nall things wearied; you will be a king governing by your brain and by\r\nyour sword; you will have in the government of the state no more than\r\nyou will be able to manage unaided; I should only interfere with you.\r\nBesides, our friendship ought never to be, I do not say impaired, but\r\nin any degree affected, by a secret thought. I shall have given you\r\nthe throne of France, you will confer on me the throne of St. Peter.\r\nWhenever your loyal, firm, and mailed hand should joined in ties of\r\nintimate association the hand of a pope such as I shall be, neither\r\nCharles V., who owned two-thirds of the habitable globe, nor\r\nCharlemagne, who possessed it entirely, will be able to reach to half\r\nyour stature. I have no alliances, I have no predilections; I will not\r\nthrow you into persecutions of heretics, nor will I cast you into the\r\ntroubled waters of family dissension; I will simply say to you: The\r\nwhole universe is our own; for me the minds of men, for you their\r\nbodies. And as I shall be the first to die, you will have my\r\ninheritance. What do you say of my plan, monseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“I say that you render me happy and proud, for no other reason than that\r\nof having comprehended you thoroughly. Monsieur d’Herblay, you shall be\r\ncardinal, and when cardinal, my prime minister; and then you will point\r\nout to me the necessary steps to be taken to secure your election as\r\npope, and I will take them. You can ask what guarantees from me you\r\nplease.”\r\n\r\n“It is useless. Never shall I act except in such a manner that you will\r\nbe the gainer; I shall never ascend the ladder of fortune, fame, or\r\nposition, until I have first seen you placed upon the round of the\r\nladder immediately above me; I shall always hold myself sufficiently\r\naloof from you to escape incurring your jealousy, sufficiently near to\r\nsustain your personal advantage and to watch over your friendship. All\r\nthe contracts in the world are easily violated because the interests\r\nincluded in them incline more to one side than to another. With us,\r\nhowever, this will never be the case; I have no need of any guarantees.”\r\n\r\n“And so--my dear brother--will disappear?”\r\n\r\n“Simply. We will remove him from his bed by means of a plank which\r\nyields to the pressure of the finger. Having retired to rest a crowned\r\nsovereign, he will awake a captive. Alone you will rule from that\r\nmoment, and you will have no interest dearer and better than that of\r\nkeeping me near you.”\r\n\r\n“I believe it. There is my hand on it, Monsieur d’Herblay.”\r\n\r\n“Allow me to kneel before you, sire, most respectfully. We will embrace\r\neach other on the day we shall have upon our temples, you the crown, I\r\nthe tiara.”\r\n\r\n“Still embrace me this very day also, and be, for and towards me, more\r\nthan great, more than skillful, more than sublime in genius; be kind and\r\nindulgent--be my father!”\r\n\r\nAramis was almost overcome as he listened to his voice; he fancied\r\nhe detected in his own heart an emotion hitherto unknown; but this\r\nimpression was speedily removed. “His father!” he thought; “yes, his\r\nHoly Father.”\r\n\r\nAnd they resumed their places in the carriage, which sped rapidly along\r\nthe road leading to Vaux-le-Vicomte.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XI. The Chateau de Vaux-le-Vicomte.\r\n\r\nThe chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte, situated about a league from Melun, had\r\nbeen built by Fouquet in 1655, at a time when there was a scarcity\r\nof money in France; Mazarin had taken all that there was, and Fouquet\r\nexpended the remainder. However, as certain men have fertile, false, and\r\nuseful vices, Fouquet, in scattering broadcast millions of money in\r\nthe construction of this palace, had found a means of gathering, as the\r\nresult of his generous profusion, three illustrious men together: Levau,\r\nthe architect of the building; Lenotre, the designer of the gardens;\r\nand Lebrun, the decorator of the apartments. If the Chateau de Vaux\r\npossessed a single fault with which it could be reproached, it was its\r\ngrand, pretentious character. It is even at the present day proverbial\r\nto calculate the number of acres of roofing, the restoration of which\r\nwould, in our age, be the ruin of fortunes cramped and narrowed as the\r\nepoch itself. Vaux-le-Vicomte, when its magnificent gates, supported\r\nby caryatides, have been passed through, has the principal front of the\r\nmain building opening upon a vast, so-called, court of honor, inclosed\r\nby deep ditches, bordered by a magnificent stone balustrade. Nothing\r\ncould be more noble in appearance than the central forecourt raised upon\r\nthe flight of steps, like a king upon his throne, having around it\r\nfour pavilions at the angles, the immense Ionic columns of which rose\r\nmajestically to the whole height of the building. The friezes ornamented\r\nwith arabesques, and the pediments which crowned the pilasters,\r\nconferred richness and grace on every part of the building, while the\r\ndomes which surmounted the whole added proportion and majesty. This\r\nmansion, built by a subject, bore a far greater resemblance to those\r\nroyal residences which Wolsey fancied he was called upon to construct,\r\nin order to present them to his master from the fear of rendering him\r\njealous. But if magnificence and splendor were displayed in any one\r\nparticular part of this palace more than another,--if anything could\r\nbe preferred to the wonderful arrangement of the interior, to the\r\nsumptuousness of the gilding, and to the profusion of the paintings and\r\nstatues, it would be the park and gardens of Vaux. The _jets d’eau_,\r\nwhich were regarded as wonderful in 1653, are still so, even at the\r\npresent time; the cascades awakened the admiration of kings and princes;\r\nand as for the famous grotto, the theme of so many poetical effusions,\r\nthe residence of that illustrious nymph of Vaux, whom Pelisson made\r\nconverse with La Fontaine, we must be spared the description of all\r\nits beauties. We will do as Despreaux did,--we will enter the park, the\r\ntrees of which are of eight years’ growth only--that is to say, in their\r\npresent position--and whose summits even yet, as they proudly tower\r\naloft, blushingly unfold their leaves to the earliest rays of the rising\r\nsun. Lenotre had hastened the pleasure of the Maecenas of his period;\r\nall the nursery-grounds had furnished trees whose growth had been\r\naccelerated by careful culture and the richest plant-food. Every tree in\r\nthe neighborhood which presented a fair appearance of beauty or stature\r\nhad been taken up by its roots and transplanted to the park. Fouquet\r\ncould well afford to purchase trees to ornament his park, since he had\r\nbought up three villages and their appurtenances (to use a legal word)\r\nto increase its extent. M. de Scudery said of this palace, that, for the\r\npurpose of keeping the grounds and gardens well watered, M. Fouquet had\r\ndivided a river into a thousand fountains, and gathered the waters of a\r\nthousand fountains into torrents. This same Monsieur de Scudery said a\r\ngreat many other things in his “Clelie,” about this palace of Valterre,\r\nthe charms of which he describes most minutely. We should be far wiser\r\nto send our curious readers to Vaux to judge for themselves, than to\r\nrefer them to “Clelie;” and yet there are as many leagues from Paris to\r\nVaux, as there are volumes of the “Clelie.”\r\n\r\nThis magnificent palace had been got ready for the reception of the\r\ngreatest reigning sovereign of the time. M. Fouquet’s friends had\r\ntransported thither, some their actors and their dresses, others their\r\ntroops of sculptors and artists; not forgetting others with their\r\nready-mended pens,--floods of impromptus were contemplated. The\r\ncascades, somewhat rebellious nymphs though they were, poured forth\r\ntheir waters brighter and clearer than crystal: they scattered over the\r\nbronze triton and nereids their waves of foam, which glistened like fire\r\nin the rays of the sun. An army of servants were hurrying to and fro in\r\nsquadrons in the courtyard and corridors; while Fouquet, who had\r\nonly that morning arrived, walked all through the palace with a calm,\r\nobservant glance, in order to give his last orders, after his intendants\r\nhad inspected everything.\r\n\r\nIt was, as we have said, the 15th of August. The sun poured down its\r\nburning rays upon the heathen deities of marble and bronze: it raised\r\nthe temperature of the water in the conch shells, and ripened, on the\r\nwalls, those magnificent peaches, of which the king, fifty years later,\r\nspoke so regretfully, when, at Marly, on an occasion of a scarcity of\r\nthe finer sorts of peaches being complained of, in the beautiful gardens\r\nthere--gardens which had cost France double the amount that had been\r\nexpended on Vaux--the _great king_ observed to some one: “You are far\r\ntoo young to have eaten any of M. Fouquet’s peaches.”\r\n\r\nOh, fame! Oh, blazon of renown! Oh, glory of this earth! That very man\r\nwhose judgment was so sound and accurate where merit was concerned--he\r\nwho had swept into his coffers the inheritance of Nicholas Fouquet, who\r\nhad robbed him of Lenotre and Lebrun, and had sent him to rot for the\r\nremainder of his life in one of the state prisons--merely remembered the\r\npeaches of that vanquished, crushed, forgotten enemy! It was to little\r\npurpose that Fouquet had squandered thirty millions of francs in the\r\nfountains of his gardens, in the crucibles of his sculptors, in\r\nthe writing-desks of his literary friends, in the portfolios of his\r\npainters; vainly had he fancied that thereby he might be remembered. A\r\npeach--a blushing, rich-flavored fruit, nestling in the trellis work\r\non the garden-wall, hidden beneath its long, green leaves,--this little\r\nvegetable production, that a dormouse would nibble up without a thought,\r\nwas sufficient to recall to the memory of this great monarch the\r\nmournful shade of the last surintendant of France.\r\n\r\nWith a perfect reliance that Aramis had made arrangements fairly to\r\ndistribute the vast number of guests throughout the palace, and that he\r\nhad not omitted to attend to any of the internal regulations for their\r\ncomfort, Fouquet devoted his entire attention to the _ensemble_ alone.\r\nIn one direction Gourville showed him the preparations which had been\r\nmade for the fireworks; in another, Moliere led him over the theater; at\r\nlast, after he had visited the chapel, the _salons_, and the galleries,\r\nand was again going downstairs, exhausted with fatigue, Fouquet saw\r\nAramis on the staircase. The prelate beckoned to him. The surintendant\r\njoined his friend, and, with him, paused before a large picture scarcely\r\nfinished. Applying himself, heart and soul, to his work, the painter\r\nLebrun, covered with perspiration, stained with paint, pale from fatigue\r\nand the inspiration of genius, was putting the last finishing touches\r\nwith his rapid brush. It was the portrait of the king, whom they were\r\nexpecting, dressed in the court suit which Percerin had condescended to\r\nshow beforehand to the bishop of Vannes. Fouquet placed himself before\r\nthis portrait, which seemed to live, as one might say, in the cool\r\nfreshness of its flesh, and in its warmth of color. He gazed upon it\r\nlong and fixedly, estimated the prodigious labor that had been bestowed\r\nupon it, and, not being able to find any recompense sufficiently great\r\nfor this Herculean effort, he passed his arm round the painter’s neck\r\nand embraced him. The surintendant, by this action, had utterly ruined\r\na suit of clothes worth a thousand pistoles, but he had satisfied, more\r\nthan satisfied, Lebrun. It was a happy moment for the artist; it was an\r\nunhappy moment for M. Percerin, who was walking behind Fouquet, and was\r\nengaged in admiring, in Lebrun’s painting, the suit that he had made for\r\nhis majesty, a perfect _objet d’art_, as he called it, which was not to\r\nbe matched except in the wardrobe of the surintendant. His distress and\r\nhis exclamations were interrupted by a signal which had been given\r\nfrom the summit of the mansion. In the direction of Melun, in the\r\nstill empty, open plain, the sentinels of Vaux had just perceived\r\nthe advancing procession of the king and the queens. His majesty was\r\nentering Melun with his long train of carriages and cavaliers.\r\n\r\n“In an hour--” said Aramis to Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“In an hour!” replied the latter, sighing.\r\n\r\n“And the people who ask one another what is the good of these royal\r\n_fetes!_” continued the bishop of Vannes, laughing, with his false\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“Alas! I, too, who am not the people, ask myself the same thing.”\r\n\r\n“I will answer you in four and twenty hours, monseigneur. Assume a\r\ncheerful countenance, for it should be a day of true rejoicing.”\r\n\r\n“Well, believe me or not, as you like, D’Herblay,” said the\r\nsurintendant, with a swelling heart, pointing at the _cortege_ of Louis,\r\nvisible in the horizon, “he certainly loves me but very little, and I do\r\nnot care much more for him; but I cannot tell you how it is, that since\r\nhe is approaching my house--”\r\n\r\n“Well, what?”\r\n\r\n“Well, since I know he is on his way here, as my guest, he is more\r\nsacred than ever for me; he is my acknowledged sovereign, and as such is\r\nvery dear to me.”\r\n\r\n“Dear? yes,” said Aramis, playing upon the word, as the Abbe Terray did,\r\nat a later period, with Louis XV.\r\n\r\n“Do not laugh, D’Herblay; I feel that, if he really seemed to wish it, I\r\ncould love that young man.”\r\n\r\n“You should not say that to me,” returned Aramis, “but rather to M.\r\nColbert.”\r\n\r\n“To M. Colbert!” exclaimed Fouquet. “Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Because he would allow you a pension out of the king’s privy purse,\r\nas soon as he becomes surintendant,” said Aramis, preparing to leave as\r\nsoon as he had dealt this last blow.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” returned Fouquet, with a gloomy look.\r\n\r\n“To my own apartment, in order to change my costume, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Whereabouts are you lodging, D’Herblay?”\r\n\r\n“In the blue room on the second story.”\r\n\r\n“The room immediately over the king’s room?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely.”\r\n\r\n“You will be subject to very great restraint there. What an idea to\r\ncondemn yourself to a room where you cannot stir or move about!”\r\n\r\n“During the night, monseigneur, I sleep or read in my bed.”\r\n\r\n“And your servants?”\r\n\r\n“I have but one attendant with me. I find my reader quite sufficient.\r\nAdieu, monseigneur; do not overfatigue yourself; keep yourself fresh for\r\nthe arrival of the king.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see you by and by, I suppose, and shall see your friend Du\r\nVallon also?”\r\n\r\n“He is lodging next to me, and is at this moment dressing.”\r\n\r\nAnd Fouquet, bowing, with a smile, passed on like a commander-in-chief\r\nwho pays the different outposts a visit after the enemy has been\r\nsignaled in sight. [2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XII. The Wine of Melun.\r\n\r\nThe king had, in point of fact, entered Melun with the intention of\r\nmerely passing through the city. The youthful monarch was most eagerly\r\nanxious for amusements; only twice during the journey had he been\r\nable to catch a glimpse of La Vallière, and, suspecting that his only\r\nopportunity of speaking to her would be after nightfall, in the gardens,\r\nand after the ceremonial of reception had been gone through, he had been\r\nvery desirous to arrive at Vaux as early as possible. But he reckoned\r\nwithout his captain of the musketeers, and without M. Colbert. Like\r\nCalypso, who could not be consoled at the departure of Ulysses, our\r\nGascon could not console himself for not having guessed why Aramis had\r\nasked Percerin to show him the king’s new costumes. “There is not a\r\ndoubt,” he said to himself, “that my friend the bishop of Vannes\r\nhad some motive in that;” and then he began to rack his brains most\r\nuselessly. D’Artagnan, so intimately acquainted with all the court\r\nintrigues, who knew the position of Fouquet better than even Fouquet\r\nhimself did, had conceived the strangest fancies and suspicions at the\r\nannouncement of the _fete_, which would have ruined a wealthy man, and\r\nwhich became impossible, utter madness even, for a man so poor as he\r\nwas. And then, the presence of Aramis, who had returned from Belle-Isle,\r\nand been nominated by Monsieur Fouquet inspector-general of all the\r\narrangements; his perseverance in mixing himself up with all the\r\nsurintendant’s affairs; his visits to Baisemeaux; all this suspicious\r\nsingularity of conduct had excessively troubled and tormented D’Artagnan\r\nduring the last two weeks.\r\n\r\n“With men of Aramis’s stamp,” he said, “one is never the stronger except\r\nsword in hand. So long as Aramis continued a soldier, there was hope of\r\ngetting the better of him; but since he has covered his cuirass with\r\na stole, we are lost. But what can Aramis’s object possibly be?” And\r\nD’Artagnan plunged again into deep thought. “What does it matter to\r\nme, after all,” he continued, “if his only object is to overthrow M.\r\nColbert? And what else can he be after?” And D’Artagnan rubbed his\r\nforehead--that fertile land, whence the plowshare of his nails had\r\nturned up so many and such admirable ideas in his time. He, at first,\r\nthought of talking the matter over with Colbert, but his friendship for\r\nAramis, the oath of earlier days, bound him too strictly. He revolted at\r\nthe bare idea of such a thing, and, besides, he hated the financier too\r\ncordially. Then, again, he wished to unburden his mind to the king; but\r\nyet the king would not be able to understand the suspicions which had\r\nnot even a shadow of reality at their base. He resolved to address\r\nhimself to Aramis, direct, the first time he met him. “I will get him,”\r\n said the musketeer, “between a couple of candles, suddenly, and when he\r\nleast expects it, I will place my hand upon his heart, and he will\r\ntell me--What will he tell me? Yes, he will tell me something, for\r\n_mordioux!_ there is something in it, I know.”\r\n\r\nSomewhat calmer, D’Artagnan made every preparation for the journey, and\r\ntook the greatest care that the military household of the king, as\r\nyet very inconsiderable in numbers, should be well officered and well\r\ndisciplined in its meager and limited proportions. The result was that,\r\nthrough the captain’s arrangements, the king, on arriving at Melun, saw\r\nhimself at the head of both the musketeers and Swiss guards, as well as\r\na picket of the French guards. It might almost have been called a small\r\narmy. M. Colbert looked at the troops with great delight: he even wished\r\nthey had been a third more in number.\r\n\r\n“But why?” said the king.\r\n\r\n“In order to show greater honor to M. Fouquet,” replied Colbert.\r\n\r\n“In order to ruin him the sooner,” thought D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nWhen this little army appeared before Melun, the chief magistrates came\r\nout to meet the king, and to present him with the keys of the city, and\r\ninvited him to enter the Hotel de Ville, in order to partake of the wine\r\nof honor. The king, who expected to pass through the city and to proceed\r\nto Vaux without delay, became quite red in the face from vexation.\r\n\r\n“Who was fool enough to occasion this delay?” muttered the king, between\r\nhis teeth, as the chief magistrate was in the middle of a long address.\r\n\r\n“Not I, certainly,” replied D’Artagnan, “but I believe it was M.\r\nColbert.”\r\n\r\nColbert, having heard his name pronounced, said, “What was M. d’Artagnan\r\ngood enough to say?”\r\n\r\n“I was good enough to remark that it was you who stopped the king’s\r\nprogress, so that he might taste the _vin de Brie_. Was I right?”\r\n\r\n“Quite so, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, then, it was you whom the king called some name or\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n“What name?”\r\n\r\n“I hardly know; but wait a moment--idiot, I think it was--no, no, it was\r\nfool or dolt. Yes; his majesty said that the man who had thought of the\r\n_vin de Melun_ was something of the sort.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, after this broadside, quietly caressed his mustache; M.\r\nColbert’s large head seemed to become larger and larger than ever.\r\nD’Artagnan, seeing how ugly anger made him, did not stop half-way. The\r\norator still went on with his speech, while the king’s color was visibly\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\n“_Mordioux!_” said the musketeer, coolly, “the king is going to have an\r\nattack of determination of blood to the head. Where the deuce did you\r\nget hold of that idea, Monsieur Colbert? You have no luck.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the financier, drawing himself up, “my zeal for the\r\nking’s service inspired me with the idea.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, Melun is a city, an excellent city, which pays well, and\r\nwhich it would be imprudent to displease.”\r\n\r\n“There, now! I, who do not pretend to be a financier, saw only one idea\r\nin your idea.”\r\n\r\n“What was that, monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“That of causing a little annoyance to M. Fouquet, who is making himself\r\nquite giddy on his donjons yonder, in waiting for us.”\r\n\r\nThis was a home-stroke, hard enough in all conscience. Colbert was\r\ncompletely thrown out of the saddle by it, and retired, thoroughly\r\ndiscomfited. Fortunately, the speech was now at an end; the king drank\r\nthe wine which was presented to him, and then every one resumed the\r\nprogress through the city. The king bit his lips in anger, for the\r\nevening was closing in, and all hope of a walk with La Vallière was at\r\nan end. In order that the whole of the king’s household should enter\r\nVaux, four hours at least were necessary, owing to the different\r\narrangements. The king, therefore, who was boiling with impatience,\r\nhurried forward as much as possible, in order to reach it before\r\nnightfall. But, at the moment he was setting off again, other and fresh\r\ndifficulties arose.\r\n\r\n“Is not the king going to sleep at Melun?” said Colbert, in a low tone\r\nof voice, to D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nM. Colbert must have been badly inspired that day, to address himself in\r\nthat manner to the chief of the musketeers; for the latter guessed that\r\nthe king’s intention was very far from that of remaining where he was.\r\nD’Artagnan would not allow him to enter Vaux except he were well and\r\nstrongly accompanied; and desired that his majesty would not enter\r\nexcept with all the escort. On the other hand, he felt that these delays\r\nwould irritate that impatient monarch beyond measure. In what way could\r\nhe possibly reconcile these difficulties? D’Artagnan took up Colbert’s\r\nremark, and determined to repeated it to the king.\r\n\r\n“Sire,” he said, “M. Colbert has been asking me if your majesty does not\r\nintend to sleep at Melun.”\r\n\r\n“Sleep at Melun! What for?” exclaimed Louis XIV. “Sleep at Melun! Who,\r\nin Heaven’s name, can have thought of such a thing, when M. Fouquet is\r\nexpecting us this evening?”\r\n\r\n“It was simply,” replied Colbert, quickly, “the fear of causing your\r\nmajesty the least delay; for, according to established etiquette, you\r\ncannot enter any place, with the exception of your own royal residences,\r\nuntil the soldiers’ quarters have been marked out by the quartermaster,\r\nand the garrison properly distributed.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan listened with the greatest attention, biting his mustache to\r\nconceal his vexation; and the queens were not less interested. They were\r\nfatigued, and would have preferred to go to rest without proceeding any\r\nfarther; more especially, in order to prevent the king walking about in\r\nthe evening with M. de Saint-Aignan and the ladies of the court, for, if\r\netiquette required the princesses to remain within their own rooms, the\r\nladies of honor, as soon as they had performed the services required of\r\nthem, had no restrictions placed upon them, but were at liberty to walk\r\nabout as they pleased. It will easily be conjectured that all these\r\nrival interests, gathering together in vapors, necessarily produced\r\nclouds, and that the clouds were likely to be followed by a tempest. The\r\nking had no mustache to gnaw, and therefore kept biting the handle of\r\nhis whip instead, with ill-concealed impatience. How could he get out of\r\nit? D’Artagnan looked as agreeable as possible, and Colbert as sulky as\r\nhe could. Who was there he could get in a passion with?\r\n\r\n“We will consult the queen,” said Louis XIV., bowing to the royal\r\nladies. And this kindness of consideration softened Maria Theresa’s\r\nheart, who, being of a kind and generous disposition, when left to her\r\nown free-will, replied:\r\n\r\n“I shall be delighted to do whatever your majesty wishes.”\r\n\r\n“How long will it take us to get to Vaux?” inquired Anne of Austria, in\r\nslow and measured accents, placing her hand upon her bosom, where the\r\nseat of her pain lay.\r\n\r\n“An hour for your majesty’s carriages,” said D’Artagnan; “the roads are\r\ntolerably good.”\r\n\r\nThe king looked at him. “And a quarter of an hour for the king,” he\r\nhastened to add.\r\n\r\n“We should arrive by daylight?” said Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n“But the billeting of the king’s military escort,” objected Colbert,\r\nsoftly, “will make his majesty lose all the advantage of his speed,\r\nhowever quick he may be.”\r\n\r\n“Double ass that you are!” thought D’Artagnan; “if I had any interest\r\nor motive in demolishing your credit with the king, I could do it in ten\r\nminutes. If I were in the king’s place,” he added aloud, “I should, in\r\ngoing to M. Fouquet, leave my escort behind me; I should go to him as a\r\nfriend; I should enter accompanied only by my captain of the guards;\r\nI should consider that I was acting more nobly, and should be invested\r\nwith a still more sacred character by doing so.”\r\n\r\nDelight sparkled in the king’s eyes. “That is indeed a very sensible\r\nsuggestion. We will go to see a friend as friends; the gentlemen who are\r\nwith the carriages can go slowly: but we who are mounted will ride on.”\r\n And he rode off, accompanied by all those who were mounted. Colbert hid\r\nhis ugly head behind his horse’s neck.\r\n\r\n“I shall be quits,” said D’Artagnan, as he galloped along, “by getting\r\na little talk with Aramis this evening. And then, M. Fouquet is a man of\r\nhonor. _Mordioux!_ I have said so, and it must be so.”\r\n\r\nAnd this was the way how, towards seven o’clock in the evening, without\r\nannouncing his arrival by the din of trumpets, and without even his\r\nadvanced guard, without out-riders or musketeers, the king presented\r\nhimself before the gate of Vaux, where Fouquet, who had been informed\r\nof his royal guest’s approach, had been waiting for the last half-hour,\r\nwith his head uncovered, surrounded by his household and his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIII. Nectar and Ambrosia.\r\n\r\nM. Fouquet held the stirrup of the king, who, having dismounted, bowed\r\nmost graciously, and more graciously still held out his hand to him,\r\nwhich Fouquet, in spite of a slight resistance on the king’s part,\r\ncarried respectfully to his lips. The king wished to wait in the first\r\ncourtyard for the arrival of the carriages, nor had he long to wait, for\r\nthe roads had been put into excellent order by the superintendent, and\r\na stone would hardly have been found of the size of an egg the whole way\r\nfrom Melun to Vaux; so that the carriages, rolling along as though on a\r\ncarpet, brought the ladies to Vaux, without jolting or fatigue, by eight\r\no’clock. They were received by Madame Fouquet, and at the moment they\r\nmade their appearance, a light as bright as day burst forth from every\r\nquarter, trees, vases, and marble statues. This species of enchantment\r\nlasted until their majesties had retired into the palace. All these\r\nwonders and magical effects which the chronicler has heaped up, or\r\nrather embalmed, in his recital, at the risk of rivaling the brain-born\r\nscenes of romancers; these splendors whereby night seemed vanquished and\r\nnature corrected, together with every delight and luxury combined for\r\nthe satisfaction of all the senses, as well as the imagination, Fouquet\r\ndid in real truth offer to his sovereign in that enchanting retreat of\r\nwhich no monarch could at that time boast of possessing an equal. We do\r\nnot intend to describe the grand banquet, at which the royal guests\r\nwere present, nor the concerts, nor the fairy-like and more than magic\r\ntransformations and metamorphoses; it will be enough for our purpose\r\nto depict the countenance the king assumed, which, from being gay, soon\r\nwore a very gloomy, constrained, and irritated expression. He remembered\r\nhis own residence, royal though it was, and the mean and indifferent\r\nstyle of luxury that prevailed there, which comprised but little more\r\nthan what was merely useful for the royal wants, without being his own\r\npersonal property. The large vases of the Louvre, the older furniture\r\nand plate of Henry II., of Francis I., and of Louis XI., were but\r\nhistoric monuments of earlier days; nothing but specimens of art, the\r\nrelics of his predecessors; while with Fouquet, the value of the article\r\nwas as much in the workmanship as in the article itself. Fouquet ate\r\nfrom a gold service, which artists in his own employ had modeled and\r\ncast for him alone. Fouquet drank wines of which the king of France did\r\nnot even know the name, and drank them out of goblets each more valuable\r\nthan the entire royal cellar.\r\n\r\nWhat, too, was to be said of the apartments, the hangings, the pictures,\r\nthe servants and officers, of every description, of his household? What\r\nof the mode of service in which etiquette was replaced by order;\r\nstiff formality by personal, unrestrained comfort; the happiness and\r\ncontentment of the guest became the supreme law of all who obeyed\r\nthe host? The perfect swarm of busily engaged persons moving about\r\nnoiselessly; the multitude of guests,--who were, however, even\r\nless numerous than the servants who waited on them,--the myriad of\r\nexquisitely prepared dishes, of gold and silver vases; the floods of\r\ndazzling light, the masses of unknown flowers of which the hot-houses\r\nhad been despoiled, redundant with luxuriance of unequaled scent and\r\nbeauty; the perfect harmony of the surroundings, which, indeed, was\r\nno more than the prelude of the promised _fete_, charmed all who were\r\nthere; and they testified their admiration over and over again, not\r\nby voice or gesture, but by deep silence and rapt attention, those\r\ntwo languages of the courtier which acknowledge the hand of no master\r\npowerful enough to restrain them.\r\n\r\nAs for the king, his eyes filled with tears; he dared not look at the\r\nqueen. Anne of Austria, whose pride was superior to that of any creature\r\nbreathing, overwhelmed her host by the contempt with which she treated\r\neverything handed to her. The young queen, kind-hearted by nature and\r\ncurious by disposition, praised Fouquet, ate with an exceedingly good\r\nappetite, and asked the names of the strange fruits as they were placed\r\nupon the table. Fouquet replied that he was not aware of their names.\r\nThe fruits came from his own stores; he had often cultivated them\r\nhimself, having an intimate acquaintance with the cultivation of exotic\r\nfruits and plants. The king felt and appreciated the delicacy of the\r\nreplies, but was only the more humiliated; he thought the queen a little\r\ntoo familiar in her manners, and that Anne of Austria resembled Juno\r\na little too much, in being too proud and haughty; his chief anxiety,\r\nhowever, was himself, that he might remain cold and distant in his\r\nbehavior, bordering lightly the limits of supreme disdain or simple\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\nBut Fouquet had foreseen all this; he was, in fact, one of those men who\r\nforesee everything. The king had expressly declared that, so long as he\r\nremained under Fouquet’s roof, he did not wish his own different repasts\r\nto be served in accordance with the usual etiquette, and that he would,\r\nconsequently, dine with the rest of society; but by the thoughtful\r\nattention of the surintendant, the king’s dinner was served up\r\nseparately, if one may so express it, in the middle of the general\r\ntable; the dinner, wonderful in every respect, from the dishes of\r\nwhich was composed, comprised everything the king liked and generally\r\npreferred to anything else. Louis had no excuse--he, indeed, who had the\r\nkeenest appetite in his kingdom--for saying that he was not hungry.\r\nNay, M. Fouquet did even better still; he certainly, in obedience to the\r\nking’s expressed desire, seated himself at the table, but as soon as\r\nthe soups were served, he arose and personally waited on the king, while\r\nMadame Fouquet stood behind the queen-mother’s armchair. The disdain\r\nof Juno and the sulky fits of temper of Jupiter could not resist this\r\nexcess of kindly feeling and polite attention. The queen ate a biscuit\r\ndipped in a glass of San-Lucar wine; and the king ate of everything,\r\nsaying to M. Fouquet: “It is impossible, monsieur le surintendant, to\r\ndine better anywhere.” Whereupon the whole court began, on all sides, to\r\ndevour the dishes spread before them with such enthusiasm that it looked\r\nas though a cloud of Egyptian locusts was settling down on green and\r\ngrowing crops.\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as his hunger was appeased, the king became morose\r\nand overgloomed again; the more so in proportion to the satisfaction he\r\nfancied he had previously manifested, and particularly on account of\r\nthe deferential manner which his courtiers had shown towards Fouquet.\r\nD’Artagnan, who ate a good deal and drank but little, without allowing\r\nit to be noticed, did not lose a single opportunity, but made a great\r\nnumber of observations which he turned to good profit.\r\n\r\nWhen the supper was finished, the king expressed a wish not to lose the\r\npromenade. The park was illuminated; the moon, too, as if she had placed\r\nherself at the orders of the lord of Vaux, silvered the trees and\r\nlake with her own bright and quasi-phosphorescent light. The air was\r\nstrangely soft and balmy; the daintily shell-gravelled walks through\r\nthe thickly set avenues yielded luxuriously to the feet. The _fete_ was\r\ncomplete in every respect, for the king, having met La Vallière in one\r\nof the winding paths of the wood, was able to press her hand and say,\r\n“I love you,” without any one overhearing him except M. d’Artagnan, who\r\nfollowed, and M. Fouquet, who preceded him.\r\n\r\nThe dreamy night of magical enchantments stole smoothly on. The king\r\nhaving requested to be shown to his room, there was immediately a\r\nmovement in every direction. The queens passed to their own apartments,\r\naccompanied by them music of theorbos and lutes; the king found his\r\nmusketeers awaiting him on the grand flight of steps, for M. Fouquet had\r\nbrought them on from Melun and had invited them to supper. D’Artagnan’s\r\nsuspicions at once disappeared. He was weary, he had supped well, and\r\nwished, for once in his life, thoroughly to enjoy a _fete_ given by a\r\nman who was in every sense of the word a king. “M. Fouquet,” he said,\r\n“is the man for me.”\r\n\r\nThe king was conducted with the greatest ceremony to the chamber of\r\nMorpheus, of which we owe some cursory description to our readers. It\r\nwas the handsomest and largest in the palace. Lebrun had painted on the\r\nvaulted ceiling the happy as well as the unhappy dreams which Morpheus\r\ninflicts on kings as well as on other men. Everything that sleep gives\r\nbirth to that is lovely, its fairy scenes, its flowers and nectar, the\r\nwild voluptuousness or profound repose of the senses, had the painter\r\nelaborated on his frescoes. It was a composition as soft and pleasing\r\nin one part as dark and gloomy and terrible in another. The poisoned\r\nchalice, the glittering dagger suspended over the head of the sleeper;\r\nwizards and phantoms with terrific masks, those half-dim shadows more\r\nalarming than the approach of fire or the somber face of midnight,\r\nthese, and such as these, he had made the companions of his more\r\npleasing pictures. No sooner had the king entered his room than a cold\r\nshiver seemed to pass through him, and on Fouquet asking him the cause\r\nof it, the king replied, as pale as death:\r\n\r\n“I am sleepy, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“Does your majesty wish for your attendants at once?”\r\n\r\n“No; I have to talk with a few persons first,” said the king. “Will you\r\nhave the goodness to tell M. Colbert I wish to see him.”\r\n\r\nFouquet bowed and left the room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIV. A Gascon, and a Gascon and a Half.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan had determined to lose no time, and in fact he never was in\r\nthe habit of doing so. After having inquired for Aramis, he had looked\r\nfor him in every direction until he had succeeded in finding him.\r\nBesides, no sooner had the king entered Vaux, than Aramis had retired to\r\nhis own room, meditating, doubtless, some new piece of gallant attention\r\nfor his majesty’s amusement. D’Artagnan desired the servants to announce\r\nhim, and found on the second story (in a beautiful room called the Blue\r\nChamber, on account of the color of its hangings) the bishop of Vannes\r\nin company with Porthos and several of the modern Epicureans. Aramis\r\ncame forward to embrace his friend, and offered him the best seat. As\r\nit was after awhile generally remarked among those present that the\r\nmusketeer was reserved, and wished for an opportunity for conversing\r\nsecretly with Aramis, the Epicureans took their leave. Porthos, however,\r\ndid not stir; for true it is that, having dined exceedingly well, he was\r\nfast asleep in his armchair; and the freedom of conversation therefore\r\nwas not interrupted by a third person. Porthos had a deep, harmonious\r\nsnore, and people might talk in the midst of its loud bass without fear\r\nof disturbing him. D’Artagnan felt that he was called upon to open the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Well, and so we have come to Vaux,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Why, yes, D’Artagnan. And how do you like the place?”\r\n\r\n“Very much, and I like M. Fouquet, also.”\r\n\r\n“Is he not a charming host?”\r\n\r\n“No one could be more so.”\r\n\r\n“I am told that the king began by showing great distance of manner\r\ntowards M. Fouquet, but that his majesty grew much more cordial\r\nafterwards.”\r\n\r\n“You did not notice it, then, since you say you have been told so?”\r\n\r\n“No; I was engaged with the gentlemen who have just left the room about\r\nthe theatrical performances and the tournaments which are to take place\r\nto-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, indeed! you are the comptroller-general of the _fetes_ here, then?”\r\n\r\n“You know I am a friend of all kinds of amusement where the exercise of\r\nthe imagination is called into activity; I have always been a poet in\r\none way or another.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I remember the verses you used to write, they were charming.”\r\n\r\n“I have forgotten them, but I am delighted to read the verses of others,\r\nwhen those others are known by the names of Moliere, Pelisson, La\r\nFontaine, etc.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what idea occurred to me this evening, Aramis?”\r\n\r\n“No; tell me what it was, for I should never be able to guess it, you\r\nhave so many.”\r\n\r\n“Well, the idea occurred to me, that the true king of France is not\r\nLouis XIV.”\r\n\r\n“_What!_” said Aramis, involuntarily, looking the musketeer full in the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“No, it is Monsieur Fouquet.”\r\n\r\nAramis breathed again, and smiled. “Ah! you are like all the rest,\r\njealous,” he said. “I would wager that it was M. Colbert who turned\r\nthat pretty phrase.” D’Artagnan, in order to throw Aramis off his guard,\r\nrelated Colbert’s misadventures with regard to the _vin de Melun_.\r\n\r\n“He comes of a mean race, does Colbert,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Quite true.”\r\n\r\n“When I think, too,” added the bishop, “that that fellow will be your\r\nminister within four months, and that you will serve him as blindly as\r\nyou did Richelieu or Mazarin--”\r\n\r\n“And as you serve M. Fouquet,” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“With this difference, though, that M. Fouquet is not M. Colbert.”\r\n\r\n“True, true,” said D’Artagnan, as he pretended to become sad and full of\r\nreflection; and then, a moment after, he added, “Why do you tell me that\r\nM. Colbert will be minister in four months?”\r\n\r\n“Because M. Fouquet will have ceased to be so,” replied Aramis.\r\n\r\n“He will be ruined, you mean?” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Completely so.”\r\n\r\n“Why does he give these _fetes_, then?” said the musketeer, in a tone so\r\nfull of thoughtful consideration, and so well assumed, that the bishop\r\nwas for the moment deceived by it. “Why did you not dissuade him from\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the phrase was just a little too much, and Aramis’s\r\nformer suspicions were again aroused. “It is done with the object of\r\nhumoring the king.”\r\n\r\n“By ruining himself?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, by ruining himself for the king.”\r\n\r\n“A most eccentric, one might say, sinister calculation, that.”\r\n\r\n“Necessity, necessity, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t see that, dear Aramis.”\r\n\r\n“Do you not? Have you not remarked M. Colbert’s daily increasing\r\nantagonism, and that he is doing his utmost to drive the king to get rid\r\nof the superintendent?”\r\n\r\n“One must be blind not to see it.”\r\n\r\n“And that a cabal is already armed against M. Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“That is well known.”\r\n\r\n“What likelihood is there that the king would join a party formed\r\nagainst a man who will have spent everything he had to please him?”\r\n\r\n“True, true,” said D’Artagnan, slowly, hardly convinced, yet curious\r\nto broach another phase of the conversation. “There are follies, and\r\nfollies,” he resumed, “and I do not like those you are committing.”\r\n\r\n“What do you allude to?”\r\n\r\n“As for the banquet, the ball, the concert, the theatricals, the\r\ntournaments, the cascades, the fireworks, the illuminations, and the\r\npresents--these are well and good, I grant; but why were not these\r\nexpenses sufficient? Why was it necessary to have new liveries and\r\ncostumes for your whole household?”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right. I told M. Fouquet that myself; he replied, that\r\nif he were rich enough he would offer the king a newly erected chateau,\r\nfrom the vanes at the houses to the very sub-cellars; completely new\r\ninside and out; and that, as soon as the king had left, he would burn\r\nthe whole building and its contents, in order that it might not be made\r\nuse of by any one else.”\r\n\r\n“How completely Spanish!”\r\n\r\n“I told him so, and he then added this: ‘Whoever advises me to spare\r\nexpense, I shall look upon as my enemy.’”\r\n\r\n“It is positive madness; and that portrait, too!”\r\n\r\n“What portrait?” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“That of the king, and the surprise as well.”\r\n\r\n“What surprise?”\r\n\r\n“The surprise you seem to have in view, and on account of which you took\r\nsome specimens away, when I met you at Percerin’s.” D’Artagnan paused.\r\nThe shaft was discharged, and all he had to do was to wait and watch its\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n“That is merely an act of graceful attention,” replied Aramis.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan went up to his friend, took hold of both his hands, and\r\nlooking him full in the eyes, said, “Aramis, do you still care for me a\r\nvery little?”\r\n\r\n“What a question to ask!”\r\n\r\n“Very good. One favor, then. Why did you take some patterns of the\r\nking’s costumes at Percerin’s?”\r\n\r\n“Come with me and ask poor Lebrun, who has been working upon them for\r\nthe last two days and nights.”\r\n\r\n“Aramis, that may be truth for everybody else, but for me--”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, D’Artagnan, you astonish me.”\r\n\r\n“Be a little considerate. Tell me the exact truth; you would not like\r\nanything disagreeable to happen to me, would you?”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend, you are becoming quite incomprehensible. What suspicion\r\ncan you have possibly got hold of?”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe in my instinctive feelings? Formerly you used to have\r\nfaith in them. Well, then, an instinct tells me that you have some\r\nconcealed project on foot.”\r\n\r\n“I--a project?”\r\n\r\n“I am convinced of it.”\r\n\r\n“What nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“I am not only sure of it, but I would even swear it.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, D’Artagnan, you cause me the greatest pain. Is it likely, if I\r\nhave any project in hand that I ought to keep secret from you, I should\r\ntell you about it? If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed,\r\nshould I not have long ago divulged it?”\r\n\r\n“No, Aramis, no. There are certain projects which are never revealed\r\nuntil the favorable opportunity arrives.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, my dear fellow,” returned the bishop, laughing, “the only\r\nthing now is, that the ‘opportunity’ has not yet arrived.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan shook his head with a sorrowful expression. “Oh, friendship,\r\nfriendship!” he said, “what an idle word you are! Here is a man who, if\r\nI were but to ask it, would suffer himself to be cut in pieces for my\r\nsake.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said Aramis, nobly.\r\n\r\n“And this man, who would shed every drop of blood in his veins for me,\r\nwill not open up before me the least corner in his heart. Friendship, I\r\nrepeat, is nothing but an unsubstantial shadow--a lure, like everything\r\nelse in this bright, dazzling world.”\r\n\r\n“It is not thus you should speak of _our_ friendship,” replied the\r\nbishop, in a firm, assured voice; “for ours is not of the same nature as\r\nthose of which you have been speaking.”\r\n\r\n“Look at us, Aramis; three out of the old ‘four.’ You are deceiving me;\r\nI suspect you; and Porthos is fast asleep. An admirable trio of friends,\r\ndon’t you think so? What an affecting relic of the former dear old\r\ntimes!”\r\n\r\n“I can only tell you one thing, D’Artagnan, and I swear it on the Bible:\r\nI love you just as I used to do. If I ever suspect you, it is on account\r\nof others, and not on account of either of us. In everything I may do,\r\nand should happen to succeed in, you will find your fourth. Will you\r\npromise me the same favor?”\r\n\r\n“If I am not mistaken, Aramis, your words--at the moment you pronounce\r\nthem--are full of generous feeling.”\r\n\r\n“Such a thing is very possible.”\r\n\r\n“You are conspiring against M. Colbert. If that be all, _mordioux_, tell\r\nme so at once. I have the instrument in my own hand, and will pull out\r\nthe tooth easily enough.”\r\n\r\nAramis could not conceal a smile of disdain that flitted over his\r\nhaughty features. “And supposing that I were conspiring against Colbert,\r\nwhat harm would there be in _that?_”\r\n\r\n“No, no; that would be too trifling a matter for you to take in hand,\r\nand it was not on that account you asked Percerin for those patterns of\r\nthe king’s costumes. Oh! Aramis, we are not enemies, remember--we are\r\nbrothers. Tell me what you wish to undertake, and, upon the word of a\r\nD’Artagnan, if I cannot help you, I will swear to remain neuter.”\r\n\r\n“I am undertaking nothing,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Aramis, a voice within me speaks and seems to trickle forth a rill of\r\nlight within my darkness: it is a voice that has never yet deceived me.\r\nIt is the king you are conspiring against.”\r\n\r\n“The king?” exclaimed the bishop, pretending to be annoyed.\r\n\r\n“Your face will not convince me; the king, I repeat.”\r\n\r\n“Will you help me?” said Aramis, smiling ironically.\r\n\r\n“Aramis, I will do more than help you--I will do more than remain\r\nneuter--I will save you.”\r\n\r\n“You are mad, D’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“I am the wiser of the two, in this matter.”\r\n\r\n“You to suspect me of wishing to assassinate the king!”\r\n\r\n“Who spoke of such a thing?” smiled the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“Well, let us understand one another. I do not see what any one can\r\ndo to a legitimate king as ours is, if he does not assassinate him.”\r\n D’Artagnan did not say a word. “Besides, you have your guards and your\r\nmusketeers here,” said the bishop.\r\n\r\n“True.”\r\n\r\n“You are not in M. Fouquet’s house, but in your own.”\r\n\r\n“True; but in spite of that, Aramis, grant me, for pity’s sake, one\r\nsingle word of a true friend.”\r\n\r\n“A true friend’s word is ever truth itself. If I think of touching, even\r\nwith my finger, the son of Anne of Austria, the true king of this realm\r\nof France--if I have not the firm intention of prostrating myself before\r\nhis throne--if in every idea I may entertain to-morrow, here at Vaux,\r\nwill not be the most glorious day my king ever enjoyed--may Heaven’s\r\nlightning blast me where I stand!” Aramis had pronounced these words\r\nwith his face turned towards the alcove of his own bedroom, where\r\nD’Artagnan, seated with his back towards the alcove, could not suspect\r\nthat any one was lying concealed. The earnestness of his words, the\r\nstudied slowness with which he pronounced them, the solemnity of his\r\noath, gave the musketeer the most complete satisfaction. He took hold\r\nof both Aramis’s hands, and shook them cordially. Aramis had endured\r\nreproaches without turning pale, and had blushed as he listened to words\r\nof praise. D’Artagnan, deceived, did him honor; but D’Artagnan, trustful\r\nand reliant, made him feel ashamed. “Are you going away?” he said, as he\r\nembraced him, in order to conceal the flush on his face.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Duty summons me. I have to get the watch-word. It seems I am to be\r\nlodged in the king’s ante-room. Where does Porthos sleep?”\r\n\r\n“Take him away with you, if you like, for he rumbles through his sleepy\r\nnose like a park of artillery.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! he does not stay with you, then?” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Not the least in the world. He has a chamber to himself, but I don’t\r\nknow where.”\r\n\r\n“Very good!” said the musketeer; from whom this separation of the two\r\nassociates removed his last suspicion, and he touched Porthos lightly\r\non the shoulder; the latter replied by a loud yawn. “Come,” said\r\nD’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“What, D’Artagnan, my dear fellow, is that you? What a lucky chance! Oh,\r\nyes--true; I have forgotten; I am at the _fete_ at Vaux.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and your beautiful dress, too.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it was very attentive on the part of Monsieur Coquelin de Voliere,\r\nwas it not?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Aramis. “You are walking so heavily you will make the\r\nflooring give way.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said the musketeer; “this room is above the dome, I think.”\r\n\r\n“And I did not choose it for a fencing-room, I assure you,” added the\r\nbishop. “The ceiling of the king’s room has all the lightness and calm\r\nof wholesome sleep. Do not forget, therefore, that my flooring is merely\r\nthe covering of his ceiling. Good night, my friends, and in ten minutes\r\nI shall be asleep myself.” And Aramis accompanied them to the door,\r\nlaughing quietly all the while. As soon as they were outside, he bolted\r\nthe door, hurriedly; closed up the chinks of the windows, and then\r\ncalled out, “Monseigneur!--monseigneur!” Philippe made his appearance\r\nfrom the alcove, as he pushed aside a sliding panel placed behind the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n“M. d’Artagnan entertains a great many suspicions, it seems,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Ah!--you recognized M. d’Artagnan, then?”\r\n\r\n“Before you called him by his name, even.”\r\n\r\n“He is your captain of musketeers.”\r\n\r\n“He is very devoted to _me_,” replied Philippe, laying a stress upon the\r\npersonal pronoun.\r\n\r\n“As faithful as a dog; but he bites sometimes. If D’Artagnan does not\r\nrecognize you before _the other_ has disappeared, rely upon D’Artagnan\r\nto the end of the world; for in that case, if he has seen nothing, he\r\nwill keep his fidelity. If he sees, when it is too late, he is a Gascon,\r\nand will never admit that he has been deceived.”\r\n\r\n“I thought so. What are we to do, now?”\r\n\r\n“Sit in this folding-chair. I am going to push aside a portion of the\r\nflooring; you will look through the opening, which answers to one of the\r\nfalse windows made in the dome of the king’s apartment. Can you see?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Philippe, starting as at the sight of an enemy; “I see the\r\nking!”\r\n\r\n“What is he doing?”\r\n\r\n“He seems to wish some man to sit down close to him.”\r\n\r\n“M. Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; wait a moment--”\r\n\r\n“Look at the notes and the portraits, my prince.”\r\n\r\n“The man whom the king wishes to sit down in his presence is M.\r\nColbert.”\r\n\r\n“Colbert sit down in the king’s presence!” exclaimed Aramis. “It is\r\nimpossible.”\r\n\r\n“Look.”\r\n\r\nAramis looked through the opening in the flooring. “Yes,” he said.\r\n“Colbert himself. Oh, monseigneur! what can we be going to hear--and\r\nwhat can result from this intimacy?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing good for M. Fouquet, at all events.”\r\n\r\nThe prince did not deceive himself.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that Louis XIV. had sent for Colbert, and Colbert had\r\narrived. The conversation began between them by the king according to\r\nhim one of the highest favors that he had ever done; it was true the\r\nking was alone with his subject. “Colbert,” said he, “sit down.”\r\n\r\nThe intendant, overcome with delight, for he feared he was about to be\r\ndismissed, refused this unprecedented honor.\r\n\r\n“Does he accept?” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“No, he remains standing.”\r\n\r\n“Let us listen, then.” And the future king and the future pope listened\r\neagerly to the simple mortals they held under their feet, ready to crush\r\nthem when they liked.\r\n\r\n“Colbert,” said the king, “you have annoyed me exceedingly to-day.”\r\n\r\n“I know it, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Very good; I like that answer. Yes, you knew it, and there was courage\r\nin the doing of it.”\r\n\r\n“I ran the risk of displeasing your majesty, but I risked, also, the\r\nconcealment of your best interests.”\r\n\r\n“What! you were afraid of something on _my_ account?”\r\n\r\n“I was, sire, even if it were nothing more than an indigestion,” said\r\nColbert; “for people do not give their sovereigns such banquets as the\r\none of to-day, unless it be to stifle them beneath the burden of good\r\nliving.” Colbert awaited the effect this coarse jest would produce upon\r\nthe king; and Louis XIV., who was the vainest and the most fastidiously\r\ndelicate man in his kingdom, forgave Colbert the joke.\r\n\r\n“The truth is,” he said, “that M. Fouquet has given me too good a meal.\r\nTell me, Colbert, where does he get all the money required for this\r\nenormous expenditure,--can you tell?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do know, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Will you be able to prove it with tolerable certainty?”\r\n\r\n“Easily; and to the utmost farthing.”\r\n\r\n“I know you are very exact.”\r\n\r\n“Exactitude is the principal qualification required in an intendant of\r\nfinances.”\r\n\r\n“But all are not so.”\r\n\r\n“I thank you majesty for so flattering a compliment from your own lips.”\r\n\r\n“M. Fouquet, therefore, is rich--very rich, and I suppose every man\r\nknows he is so.”\r\n\r\n“Every one, sire; the living as well as the dead.”\r\n\r\n“What does that mean, Monsieur Colbert?”\r\n\r\n“The living are witnesses of M. Fouquet’s wealth,--they admire and\r\napplaud the result produced; but the dead, wiser and better informed\r\nthan we are, know how that wealth was obtained--and they rise up in\r\naccusation.”\r\n\r\n“So that M. Fouquet owes his wealth to some cause or other.”\r\n\r\n“The occupation of an intendant very often favors those who practice\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“You have something to say to me more confidentially, I perceive; do not\r\nbe afraid, we are quite alone.”\r\n\r\n“I am never afraid of anything under the shelter of my own conscience,\r\nand under the protection of your majesty,” said Colbert, bowing.\r\n\r\n“If the dead, therefore, were to speak--”\r\n\r\n“They do speak sometimes, sire,--read.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” murmured Aramis, in the prince’s ear, who, close beside him,\r\nlistened without losing a syllable, “since you are placed here,\r\nmonseigneur, in order to learn your vocation of a king, listen to a\r\npiece of infamy--of a nature truly royal. You are about to be a\r\nwitness of one of those scenes which the foul fiend alone conceives and\r\nexecutes. Listen attentively,--you will find your advantage in it.”\r\n\r\nThe prince redoubled his attention, and saw Louis XIV. take from\r\nColbert’s hands a letter the latter held out to him.\r\n\r\n“The late cardinal’s handwriting,” said the king.\r\n\r\n“Your majesty has an excellent memory,” replied Colbert, bowing; “it\r\nis an immense advantage for a king who is destined for hard work to\r\nrecognize handwritings at the first glance.”\r\n\r\nThe king read Mazarin’s letter, and, as its contents are already known\r\nto the reader, in consequence of the misunderstanding between Madame de\r\nChevreuse and Aramis, nothing further would be learned if we stated them\r\nhere again.\r\n\r\n“I do not quite understand,” said the king, greatly interested.\r\n\r\n“Your majesty has not acquired the utilitarian habit of checking the\r\npublic accounts.”\r\n\r\n“I see that it refers to money that had been given to M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\n“Thirteen millions. A tolerably good sum.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Well, these thirteen millions are wanting to balance the total of\r\nthe account. That is what I do not very well understand. How was this\r\ndeficit possible?”\r\n\r\n“Possible I do not say; but there is no doubt about fact that it is\r\nreally so.”\r\n\r\n“You say that these thirteen millions are found to be wanting in the\r\naccounts?”\r\n\r\n“I do not say so, but the registry does.”\r\n\r\n“And this letter of M. Mazarin indicates the employment of that sum and\r\nthe name of the person with whom it was deposited?”\r\n\r\n“As your majesty can judge for yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and the result is, then, that M. Fouquet has not yet restored the\r\nthirteen millions.”\r\n\r\n“That results from the accounts, certainly, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and, consequently--”\r\n\r\n“Well, sire, in that case, inasmuch as M. Fouquet has not yet given\r\nback the thirteen millions, he must have appropriated them to his own\r\npurpose; and with those thirteen millions one could incur four times and\r\na little more as much expense, and make four times as great a display,\r\nas your majesty was able to do at Fontainebleau, where we only spent\r\nthree millions altogether, if you remember.”\r\n\r\nFor a blunderer, the _souvenir_ he had evoked was a rather skillfully\r\ncontrived piece of baseness; for by the remembrance of his own _fete_\r\nhe, for the first time, perceived its inferiority compared with that of\r\nFouquet. Colbert received back again at Vaux what Fouquet had given him\r\nat Fontainebleau, and, as a good financier, returned it with the best\r\npossible interest. Having once disposed the king’s mind in this artful\r\nway, Colbert had nothing of much importance to detain him. He felt that\r\nsuch was the case, for the king, too, had again sunk into a dull and\r\ngloomy state. Colbert awaited the first words from the king’s lips\r\nwith as much impatience as Philippe and Aramis did from their place of\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n“Are you aware what is the usual and natural consequence of all this,\r\nMonsieur Colbert?” said the king, after a few moments’ reflection.\r\n\r\n“No, sire, I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, the fact of the appropriation of the thirteen millions, if\r\nit can be proved--”\r\n\r\n“But it is so already.”\r\n\r\n“I mean if it were to be declared and certified, M. Colbert.”\r\n\r\n“I think it will be to-morrow, if your majesty--”\r\n\r\n“Were we not under M. Fouquet’s roof, you were going to say, perhaps,”\r\n replied the king, with something of nobility in his demeanor.\r\n\r\n“The king is in his own palace wherever he may be--especially in houses\r\nwhich the royal money has constructed.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Philippe in a low tone to Aramis, “that the architect\r\nwho planned this dome ought, anticipating the use it could be put to at\r\na future opportunity, so to have contrived that it might be made to fall\r\nupon the heads of scoundrels such as M. Colbert.”\r\n\r\n“I think so too,” replied Aramis; “but M. Colbert is so very _near the\r\nking_ at this moment.”\r\n\r\n“That is true, and that would open the succession.”\r\n\r\n“Of which your younger brother would reap all the advantage,\r\nmonseigneur. But stay, let us keep quiet, and go on listening.”\r\n\r\n“We shall not have long to listen,” said the young prince.\r\n\r\n“Why not, monseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“Because, if I were king, I should make no further reply.”\r\n\r\n“And what would you do?”\r\n\r\n“I should wait until to-morrow morning to give myself time for\r\nreflection.”\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. at last raised his eyes, and finding Colbert attentively\r\nwaiting for his next remarks, said, hastily, changing the conversation,\r\n“M. Colbert, I perceive it is getting very late, and I shall now retire\r\nto bed. By to-morrow morning I shall have made up my mind.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sire,” returned Colbert, greatly incensed, although he\r\nrestrained himself in the presence of the king.\r\n\r\nThe king made a gesture of adieu, and Colbert withdrew with a respectful\r\nbow. “My attendants!” cried the king; and, as they entered the\r\napartment, Philippe was about to quit his post of observation.\r\n\r\n“A moment longer,” said Aramis to him, with his accustomed gentleness of\r\nmanner; “what has just now taken place is only a detail, and to-morrow\r\nwe shall have no occasion to think anything more about it; but the\r\nceremony of the king’s retiring to rest, the etiquette observed in\r\naddressing the king, that indeed is of the greatest importance. Learn,\r\nsire, and study well how you ought to go to bed of a night. Look! look!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV. Colbert.\r\n\r\nHistory will tell us, or rather history has told us, of the various\r\nevents of the following day, of the splendid _fetes_ given by the\r\nsurintendant to his sovereign. Nothing but amusement and delight was\r\nallowed to prevail throughout the whole of the following day; there\r\nwas a promenade, a banquet, a comedy to be acted, and a comedy, too,\r\nin which, to his great amazement, Porthos recognized “M. Coquelin de\r\nVoliere” as one of the actors, in the piece called “Les Facheux.” Full\r\nof preoccupation, however, from the scene of the previous evening, and\r\nhardly recovered from the effects of the poison which Colbert had then\r\nadministered to him, the king, during the whole of the day, so brilliant\r\nin its effects, so full of unexpected and startling novelties, in which\r\nall the wonders of the “Arabian Night’s Entertainments” seemed to be\r\nreproduced for his especial amusement--the king, we say, showed himself\r\ncold, reserved, and taciturn. Nothing could smooth the frowns upon\r\nhis face; every one who observed him noticed that a deep feeling of\r\nresentment, of remote origin, increased by slow degrees, as the source\r\nbecomes a river, thanks to the thousand threads of water that increase\r\nits body, was keenly alive in the depths of the king’s heart. Towards\r\nthe middle of the day only did he begin to resume a little serenity of\r\nmanner, and by that time he had, in all probability, made up his mind.\r\nAramis, who followed him step by step in his thoughts, as in his walk,\r\nconcluded that the event he was expecting would not be long before it\r\nwas announced. This time Colbert seemed to walk in concert with the\r\nbishop of Vannes, and had he received for every annoyance which he\r\ninflicted on the king a word of direction from Aramis, he could not\r\nhave done better. During the whole of the day the king, who, in all\r\nprobability, wished to free himself from some of the thoughts which\r\ndisturbed his mind, seemed to seek La Vallière’s society as actively as\r\nhe seemed to show his anxiety to flee that of M. Colbert or M. Fouquet.\r\nThe evening came. The king had expressed a wish not to walk in the park\r\nuntil after cards in the evening. In the interval between supper and\r\nthe promenade, cards and dice were introduced. The king won a thousand\r\npistoles, and, having won them, put them in his pocket, and then rose,\r\nsaying, “And now, gentlemen, to the park.” He found the ladies of the\r\ncourt were already there. The king, we have before observed, had won a\r\nthousand pistoles, and had put them in his pocket; but M. Fouquet had\r\nsomehow contrived to lose ten thousand, so that among the courtiers\r\nthere was still left a hundred and ninety thousand francs’ profit to\r\ndivide, a circumstance which made the countenances of the courtiers and\r\nthe officers of the king’s household the most joyous countenances in\r\nthe world. It was not the same, however, with the king’s face; for,\r\nnotwithstanding his success at play, to which he was by no means\r\ninsensible, there still remained a slight shade of dissatisfaction.\r\nColbert was waiting for or upon him at the corner of one of the avenues;\r\nhe was most probably waiting there in consequence of a rendezvous which\r\nhad been given him by the king, as Louis XIV., who had avoided him, or\r\nwho had seemed to avoid him, suddenly made him a sign, and they then\r\nstruck into the depths of the park together. But La Vallière, too, had\r\nobserved the king’s gloomy aspect and kindling glances; she had remarked\r\nthis--and as nothing which lay hidden or smoldering in his heart\r\nwas hidden from the gaze of her affection, she understood that this\r\nrepressed wrath menaced some one; she prepared to withstand the current\r\nof his vengeance, and intercede like an angel of mercy. Overcome by\r\nsadness, nervously agitated, deeply distressed at having been so long\r\nseparated from her lover, disturbed at the sight of the emotion she\r\nhad divined, she accordingly presented herself to the king with an\r\nembarrassed aspect, which in his then disposition of mind the king\r\ninterpreted unfavorably. Then, as they were alone--nearly alone,\r\ninasmuch as Colbert, as soon as he perceived the young girl approaching,\r\nhad stopped and drawn back a dozen paces--the king advanced towards\r\nLa Vallière and took her by the hand. “Mademoiselle,” he said to her,\r\n“should I be guilty of an indiscretion if I were to inquire if you were\r\nindisposed? for you seem to breathe as if you were oppressed by some\r\nsecret cause of uneasiness, and your eyes are filled with tears.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! sire, if I be indeed so, and if my eyes are indeed full of tears, I\r\nam sorrowful only at the sadness which seems to oppress your majesty.”\r\n\r\n“My sadness? You are mistaken, mademoiselle; no, it is not sadness I\r\nexperience.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, then, sire?”\r\n\r\n“Humiliation.”\r\n\r\n“Humiliation? oh! sire, what a word for you to use!”\r\n\r\n“I mean, mademoiselle, that wherever I may happen to be, no one else\r\nought to be the master. Well, then, look round you on every side, and\r\njudge whether I am not eclipsed--I, the king of France--before the\r\nmonarch of these wide domains. Oh!” he continued, clenching his hands\r\nand teeth, “when I think that this king--”\r\n\r\n“Well, sire?” said Louise, terrified.\r\n\r\n“--That this king is a faithless, unworthy servant, who grows proud and\r\nself-sufficient upon the strength of property that belongs to me, and\r\nwhich he has stolen. And therefore I am about to change this impudent\r\nminister’s _fete_ into sorrow and mourning, of which the nymph of Vaux,\r\nas the poets say, shall not soon lose the remembrance.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! your majesty--”\r\n\r\n“Well, mademoiselle, are you about to take M. Fouquet’s part?” said\r\nLouis, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“No, sire; I will only ask whether you are well informed. Your majesty\r\nhas more than once learned the value of accusations made at court.”\r\n\r\nLouis XIV. made a sign for Colbert to approach. “Speak, Monsieur\r\nColbert,” said the young prince, “for I almost believe that Mademoiselle\r\nde la Vallière has need of your assistance before she can put any faith\r\nin the king’s word. Tell mademoiselle what M. Fouquet has done; and you,\r\nmademoiselle, will perhaps have the kindness to listen. It will not be\r\nlong.”\r\n\r\nWhy did Louis XIV. insist upon it in such a manner? A very simple\r\nreason--his heart was not at rest, his mind was not thoroughly\r\nconvinced; he imagined there lay some dark, hidden, tortuous intrigue\r\nbehind these thirteen millions of francs; and he wished that the\r\npure heart of La Vallière, which had revolted at the idea of theft\r\nor robbery, should approve--even were it only by a single word--the\r\nresolution he had taken, and which, nevertheless, he hesitated before\r\ncarrying into execution.\r\n\r\n“Speak, monsieur,” said La Vallière to Colbert, who had advanced;\r\n“speak, since the king wishes me to listen to you. Tell me, what is the\r\ncrime with which M. Fouquet is charged?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! not very heinous, mademoiselle,” he returned, “a mere abuse of\r\nconfidence.”\r\n\r\n“Speak, speak, Colbert; and when you have related it, leave us, and go\r\nand inform M. d’Artagnan that I have certain orders to give him.”\r\n\r\n“M. d’Artagnan, sire!” exclaimed La Vallière; “but why send for M.\r\nd’Artagnan? I entreat you to tell me.”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ in order to arrest this haughty, arrogant Titan who, true to\r\nhis menace, threatens to scale my heaven.”\r\n\r\n“Arrest M. Fouquet, do you say?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! does that surprise you?”\r\n\r\n“In his own house!”\r\n\r\n“Why not? If he be guilty, he is as guilty in his own house as anywhere\r\nelse.”\r\n\r\n“M. Fouquet, who at this moment is ruining himself for his sovereign.”\r\n\r\n“In plain truth, mademoiselle, it seems as if you were defending this\r\ntraitor.”\r\n\r\nColbert began to chuckle silently. The king turned round at the sound of\r\nthis suppressed mirth.\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said La Vallière, “it is not M. Fouquet I am defending; it is\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“Me! you are defending me?”\r\n\r\n“Sire, you would dishonor yourself if you were to give such an order.”\r\n\r\n“Dishonor myself!” murmured the king, turning pale with anger. “In plain\r\ntruth, mademoiselle, you show a strange persistence in what you say.”\r\n\r\n“If I do, sire, my only motive is that of serving your majesty,” replied\r\nthe noble-hearted girl: “for that I would risk, I would sacrifice my\r\nvery life, without the least reserve.”\r\n\r\nColbert seemed inclined to grumble and complain. La Vallière, that\r\ntimid, gentle lamb, turned round upon him, and with a glance like\r\nlightning imposed silence upon him. “Monsieur,” she said, “when the\r\nking acts well, whether, in doing so, he does either myself or those\r\nwho belong to me an injury, I have nothing to say; but were the king to\r\nconfer a benefit either upon me or mine, and if he acted badly, I should\r\ntell him so.”\r\n\r\n“But it appears to me, mademoiselle,” Colbert ventured to say, “that I\r\ntoo love the king.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur, we both love him, but each in a different manner,”\r\n replied La Vallière, with such an accent that the heart of the young\r\nking was powerfully affected by it. “I love him so deeply, that the\r\nwhole world is aware of it; so purely, that the king himself does not\r\ndoubt my affection. He is my king and my master; I am the least of all\r\nhis servants. But whoso touches his honor assails my life. Therefore, I\r\nrepeat, that they dishonor the king who advise him to arrest M. Fouquet\r\nunder his own roof.”\r\n\r\nColbert hung down his head, for he felt that the king had abandoned him.\r\nHowever, as he bent his head, he murmured, “Mademoiselle, I have only\r\none word to say.”\r\n\r\n“Do not say it, then, monsieur; for I would not listen to it. Besides,\r\nwhat could you have to tell me? That M. Fouquet has been guilty of\r\ncertain crimes? I believe he has, because the king has said so; and,\r\nfrom the moment the king said, ‘I think so,’ I have no occasion for\r\nother lips to say, ‘I affirm it.’ But, were M. Fouquet the vilest of\r\nmen, I should say aloud, ‘M. Fouquet’s person is sacred to the king\r\nbecause he is the guest of M. Fouquet. Were his house a den of thieves,\r\nwere Vaux a cave of coiners or robbers, his home is sacred, his palace\r\nis inviolable, since his wife is living in it; and that is an asylum\r\nwhich even executioners would not dare to violate.’”\r\n\r\nLa Vallière paused, and was silent. In spite of himself the king could\r\nnot but admire her; he was overpowered by the passionate energy of her\r\nvoice; by the nobleness of the cause she advocated. Colbert yielded,\r\novercome by the inequality of the struggle. At last the king breathed\r\nagain more freely, shook his head, and held out his hand to La Vallière.\r\n“Mademoiselle,” he said, gently, “why do you decide against me? Do you\r\nknow what this wretched fellow will do, if I give him time to breathe\r\nagain?”\r\n\r\n“Is he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?”\r\n\r\n“Should he escape, and take to flight?” exclaimed Colbert.\r\n\r\n“Well, monsieur, it will always remain on record, to the king’s eternal\r\nhonor, that he allowed M. Fouquet to flee; and the more guilty he may\r\nhave been, the greater will the king’s honor and glory appear, compared\r\nwith such unnecessary misery and shame.”\r\n\r\nLouis kissed La Vallière’s hand, as he knelt before her.\r\n\r\n“I am lost,” thought Colbert; then suddenly his face brightened up\r\nagain. “Oh! no, no, aha, old fox!--not yet,” he said to himself.\r\n\r\nAnd while the king, protected from observation by the thick covert of an\r\nenormous lime, pressed La Vallière to his breast, with all the ardor of\r\nineffable affection, Colbert tranquilly fumbled among the papers in his\r\npocket-book and drew out of it a paper folded in the form of a letter,\r\nsomewhat yellow, perhaps, but one that must have been most precious,\r\nsince the intendant smiled as he looked at it; he then bent a look, full\r\nof hatred, upon the charming group which the young girl and the king\r\nformed together--a group revealed but for a moment, as the light of the\r\napproaching torches shone upon it. Louis noticed the light reflected\r\nupon La Vallière’s white dress. “Leave me, Louise,” he said, “for some\r\none is coming.”\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle, mademoiselle, some one is coming,” cried Colbert, to\r\nexpedite the young girl’s departure.\r\n\r\nLouise disappeared rapidly among the trees; and then, as the king, who\r\nhad been on his knees before the young girl, was rising from his humble\r\nposture, Colbert exclaimed, “Ah! Mademoiselle de la Vallière has let\r\nsomething fall.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?” inquired the king.\r\n\r\n“A paper--a letter--something white; look there, sire.”\r\n\r\nThe king stooped down immediately and picked up the letter, crumpling it\r\nin his hand, as he did so; and at the same moment the torches arrived,\r\ninundating the blackness of the scene with a flood of light as bight as\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVI. Jealousy.\r\n\r\nThe torches we have just referred to, the eager attention every one\r\ndisplayed, and the new ovation paid to the king by Fouquet, arrived in\r\ntime to suspend the effect of a resolution which La Vallière had already\r\nconsiderably shaken in Louis XIV.’s heart. He looked at Fouquet with a\r\nfeeling almost of gratitude for having given La Vallière an opportunity\r\nof showing herself so generously disposed, so powerful in the influence\r\nshe exercised over his heart. The moment of the last and greatest\r\ndisplay had arrived. Hardly had Fouquet conducted the king towards\r\nthe chateau, when a mass of fire burst from the dome of Vaux, with a\r\nprodigious uproar, pouring a flood of dazzling cataracts of rays on\r\nevery side, and illumining the remotest corners of the gardens. The\r\nfireworks began. Colbert, at twenty paces from the king, who was\r\nsurrounded and _feted_ by the owner of Vaux, seemed, by the obstinate\r\npersistence of his gloomy thoughts, to do his utmost to recall Louis’s\r\nattention, which the magnificence of the spectacle was already, in his\r\nopinion, too easily diverting. Suddenly, just as Louis was on the point\r\nof holding it out to Fouquet, he perceived in his hand the paper which,\r\nas he believed, La Vallière had dropped at his feet as she hurried away.\r\nThe still stronger magnet of love drew the young prince’s attention\r\ntowards the _souvenir_ of his idol; and, by the brilliant light, which\r\nincreased momentarily in beauty, and drew from the neighboring villages\r\nloud cheers of admiration, the king read the letter, which he supposed\r\nwas a loving and tender epistle La Vallière had destined for him. But as\r\nhe read it, a death-like pallor stole over his face, and an expression\r\nof deep-seated wrath, illumined by the many-colored fire which gleamed\r\nso brightly, soaringly around the scene, produced a terrible spectacle,\r\nwhich every one would have shuddered at, could they only have read into\r\nhis heart, now torn by the most stormy and most bitter passions. There\r\nwas no truce for him now, influenced as he was by jealousy and mad\r\npassion. From the very moment when the dark truth was revealed to\r\nhim, every gentler feeling seemed to disappear; pity, kindness of\r\nconsideration, the religion of hospitality, all were forgotten. In\r\nthe bitter pang which wrung his heart, he, still too weak to hide his\r\nsufferings, was almost on the point of uttering a cry of alarm, and\r\ncalling his guards to gather round him. This letter which Colbert had\r\nthrown down at the king’s feet, the reader has doubtlessly guessed, was\r\nthe same that had disappeared with the porter Toby at Fontainebleau,\r\nafter the attempt which Fouquet had made upon La Vallière’s heart.\r\nFouquet saw the king’s pallor, and was far from guessing the evil;\r\nColbert saw the king’s anger, and rejoiced inwardly at the approach\r\nof the storm. Fouquet’s voice drew the young prince from his wrathful\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, sire?” inquired the superintendent, with an\r\nexpression of graceful interest.\r\n\r\nLouis made a violent effort over himself, as he replied, “Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid your majesty is suffering?”\r\n\r\n“I am suffering, and have already told you so, monsieur; but it is\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nAnd the king, without waiting for the termination of the fireworks,\r\nturned towards the chateau. Fouquet accompanied him, and the whole court\r\nfollowed, leaving the remains of the fireworks consuming for their own\r\namusement. The superintendent endeavored again to question Louis XIV.,\r\nbut did not succeed in obtaining a reply. He imagined there had been\r\nsome misunderstanding between Louis and La Vallière in the park,\r\nwhich had resulted in a slight quarrel; and that the king, who was not\r\nordinarily sulky by disposition, but completely absorbed by his passion\r\nfor La Vallière, had taken a dislike to every one because his mistress\r\nhad shown herself offended with him. This idea was sufficient to console\r\nhim; he had even a friendly and kindly smile for the young king, when\r\nthe latter wished him good night. This, however, was not all the king\r\nhad to submit to; he was obliged to undergo the usual ceremony, which on\r\nthat evening was marked by close adherence to the strictest etiquette.\r\nThe next day was the one fixed for the departure; it was but proper that\r\nthe guests should thank their host, and show him a little attention\r\nin return for the expenditure of his twelve millions. The only remark,\r\napproaching to amiability, which the king could find to say to M.\r\nFouquet, as he took leave of him, were in these words, “M. Fouquet,\r\nyou shall hear from me. Be good enough to desire M. d’Artagnan to come\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nBut the blood of Louis XIV., who had so profoundly dissimulated his\r\nfeelings, boiled in his veins; and he was perfectly willing to order\r\nM. Fouquet to be put an end to with the same readiness, indeed, as his\r\npredecessor had caused the assassination of le Marechal d’Ancre; and so\r\nhe disguised the terrible resolution he had formed beneath one of those\r\nroyal smiles which, like lightning-flashes, indicated _coups d’etat_.\r\nFouquet took the king’s hand and kissed it; Louis shuddered throughout\r\nhis whole frame, but allowed M. Fouquet to touch his hand with his lips.\r\nFive minutes afterwards, D’Artagnan, to whom the royal order had been\r\ncommunicated, entered Louis XIV.’s apartment. Aramis and Philippe were\r\nin theirs, still eagerly attentive, and still listening with all their\r\nears. The king did not even give the captain of the musketeers time\r\nto approach his armchair, but ran forward to meet him. “Take care,” he\r\nexclaimed, “that no one enters here.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sire,” replied the captain, whose glance had for a long time\r\npast analyzed the stormy indications on the royal countenance. He gave\r\nthe necessary order at the door; but, returning to the king, he said,\r\n“Is there something fresh the matter, your majesty?”\r\n\r\n“How many men have you here?” inquired the king, without making any\r\nother reply to the question addressed to him.\r\n\r\n“What for, sire?”\r\n\r\n“How many men have you, I say?” repeated the king, stamping upon the\r\nground with his foot.\r\n\r\n“I have the musketeers.”\r\n\r\n“Well; and what others?”\r\n\r\n“Twenty guards and thirteen Swiss.”\r\n\r\n“How many men will be required to--”\r\n\r\n“To do what, sire?” replied the musketeer, opening his large, calm eyes.\r\n\r\n“To arrest M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan fell back a step.\r\n\r\n“To arrest M. Fouquet!” he burst forth.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to tell me that it is impossible?” exclaimed the king, in\r\ntones of cold, vindictive passion.\r\n\r\n“I never say that anything is impossible,” replied D’Artagnan, wounded\r\nto the quick.\r\n\r\n“Very well; do it, then.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan turned on his heel, and made his way towards the door; it was\r\nbut a short distance, and he cleared it in half a dozen paces; when he\r\nreached it he suddenly paused, and said, “Your majesty will forgive me,\r\nbut, in order to effect this arrest, I should like written directions.”\r\n\r\n“For what purpose--and since when has the king’s word been insufficient\r\nfor you?”\r\n\r\n“Because the word of a king, when it springs from a feeling of anger,\r\nmay possibly change when the feeling changes.”\r\n\r\n“A truce to set phrases, monsieur; you have another thought besides\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I, at least, have certain thoughts and ideas, which, unfortunately,\r\nothers have not,” D’Artagnan replied, impertinently.\r\n\r\nThe king, in the tempest of his wrath, hesitated, and drew back in the\r\nface of D’Artagnan’s frank courage, just as a horse crouches on his\r\nhaunches under the strong hand of a bold and experienced rider. “What is\r\nyour thought?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“This, sire,” replied D’Artagnan: “you cause a man to be arrested when\r\nyou are still under his roof; and passion is alone the cause of that.\r\nWhen your anger shall have passed, you will regret what you have done;\r\nand then I wish to be in a position to show you your signature. If that,\r\nhowever, should fail to be a reparation, it will at least show us that\r\nthe king was wrong to lose his temper.”\r\n\r\n“Wrong to lose his temper!” cried the king, in a loud, passionate voice.\r\n“Did not my father, my grandfathers, too, before me, lose their temper\r\nat times, in Heaven’s name?”\r\n\r\n“The king your father and the king your grandfather never lost their\r\ntemper except when under the protection of their own palace.”\r\n\r\n“The king is master wherever he may be.”\r\n\r\n“That is a flattering, complimentary phrase which cannot proceed from\r\nany one but M. Colbert; but it happens not to be the truth. The king is\r\nat home in every man’s house when he has driven its owner out of it.”\r\n\r\nThe king bit his lips, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Can it be possible?” said D’Artagnan; “here is a man who is positively\r\nruining himself in order to please you, and you wish to have him\r\narrested! _Mordioux!_ Sire, if my name was Fouquet, and people treated\r\nme in that manner, I would swallow at a single gulp all sorts of\r\nfireworks and other things, and I would set fire to them, and send\r\nmyself and everybody else in blown-up atoms to the sky. But it is all\r\nthe same; it is your wish, and it shall be done.”\r\n\r\n“Go,” said the king; “but have you men enough?”\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose I am going to take a whole host to help me? Arrest M.\r\nFouquet! why, that is so easy that a very child might do it! It is like\r\ndrinking a glass of wormwood; one makes an ugly face, and that is all.”\r\n\r\n“If he defends himself?”\r\n\r\n“He! it is not at all likely. Defend himself when such extreme harshness\r\nas you are going to practice makes the man a very martyr! Nay, I am sure\r\nthat if he has a million of francs left, which I very much doubt, he\r\nwould be willing enough to give it in order to have such a termination\r\nas this. But what does that matter? it shall be done at once.”\r\n\r\n“Stay,” said the king; “do not make his arrest a public affair.”\r\n\r\n“That will be more difficult.”\r\n\r\n“Why so?”\r\n\r\n“Because nothing is easier than to go up to M. Fouquet in the midst of\r\na thousand enthusiastic guests who surround him, and say, ‘In the king’s\r\nname, I arrest you.’ But to go up to him, to turn him first one way\r\nand then another, to drive him up into one of the corners of the\r\nchess-board, in such a way that he cannot escape; to take him away from\r\nhis guests, and keep him a prisoner for you, without one of them, alas!\r\nhaving heard anything about it; that, indeed, is a genuine difficulty,\r\nthe greatest of all, in truth; and I hardly see how it is to be done.”\r\n\r\n“You had better say it is impossible, and you will have finished much\r\nsooner. Heaven help me, but I seem to be surrounded by people who\r\nprevent me doing what I wish.”\r\n\r\n“I do not prevent your doing anything. Have you indeed decided?”\r\n\r\n“Take care of M. Fouquet, until I shall have made up my mind by\r\nto-morrow morning.”\r\n\r\n“That shall be done, sire.”\r\n\r\n“And return, when I rise in the morning, for further orders; and now\r\nleave me to myself.”\r\n\r\n“You do not even want M. Colbert, then?” said the musketeer, firing his\r\nlast shot as he was leaving the room. The king started. With his whole\r\nmind fixed on the thought of revenge, he had forgotten the cause and\r\nsubstance of the offense.\r\n\r\n“No, no one,” he said; “no one here! Leave me.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan quitted the room. The king closed the door with his own\r\nhands, and began to walk up and down his apartment at a furious pace,\r\nlike a wounded bull in an arena, trailing from his horn the colored\r\nstreamers and the iron darts. At last he began to take comfort in the\r\nexpression of his violent feelings.\r\n\r\n“Miserable wretch that he is! not only does he squander my finances, but\r\nwith his ill-gotten plunder he corrupts secretaries, friends, generals,\r\nartists, and all, and tries to rob me of the one to whom I am most\r\nattached. This is the reason that perfidious girl so boldly took\r\nhis part! Gratitude! and who can tell whether it was not a stronger\r\nfeeling--love itself?” He gave himself up for a moment to the bitterest\r\nreflections. “A satyr!” he thought, with that abhorrent hate with which\r\nyoung men regard those more advanced in life, who still think of love.\r\n“A man who has never found opposition or resistance in any one, who\r\nlavishes his gold and jewels in every direction, and who retains his\r\nstaff of painters in order to take the portraits of his mistresses\r\nin the costume of goddesses.” The king trembled with passion as he\r\ncontinued, “He pollutes and profanes everything that belongs to me! He\r\ndestroys everything that is mine. He will be my death at last, I\r\nknow. That man is too much for me; he is my mortal enemy, but he\r\nshall forthwith fall! I hate him--I hate him--I hate him!” and as he\r\npronounced these words, he struck the arm of the chair in which he was\r\nsitting violently, over and over again, and then rose like one in an\r\nepileptic fit. “To-morrow! to-morrow! oh, happy day!” he murmured, “when\r\nthe sun rises, no other rival shall that brilliant king of space possess\r\nbut me. That man shall fall so low that when people look at the abject\r\nruin my anger shall have wrought, they will be forced to confess at\r\nlast and at least that I am indeed greater than he.” The king, who was\r\nincapable of mastering his emotions any longer, knocked over with a blow\r\nof his fist a small table placed close to his bedside, and in the very\r\nbitterness of anger, almost weeping, and half-suffocated, he threw\r\nhimself on his bed, dressed as he was, and bit the sheets in his\r\nextremity of passion, trying to find repose of body at least there. The\r\nbed creaked beneath his weight, and with the exception of a few broken\r\nsounds, emerging, or, one might say, exploding, from his overburdened\r\nchest, absolute silence soon reigned in the chamber of Morpheus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVII. High Treason.\r\n\r\nThe ungovernable fury which took possession of the king at the sight and\r\nat the perusal of Fouquet’s letter to La Vallière by degrees subsided\r\ninto a feeling of pain and extreme weariness. Youth, invigorated by\r\nhealth and lightness of spirits, requiring soon that what it loses\r\nshould be immediately restored--youth knows not those endless, sleepless\r\nnights which enable us to realize the fable of the vulture unceasingly\r\nfeeding on Prometheus. In cases where the man of middle life, in his\r\nacquired strength of will and purpose, and the old, in their state of\r\nnatural exhaustion, find incessant augmentation of their bitter sorrow,\r\na young man, surprised by the sudden appearance of misfortune, weakens\r\nhimself in sighs, and groans, and tears, directly struggling with his\r\ngrief, and is thereby far sooner overthrown by the inflexible enemy with\r\nwhom he is engaged. Once overthrown, his struggles cease. Louis could\r\nnot hold out more than a few minutes, at the end of which he had ceased\r\nto clench his hands, and scorch in fancy with his looks the invisible\r\nobjects of his hatred; he soon ceased to attack with his violent\r\nimprecations not M. Fouquet alone, but even La Vallière herself; from\r\nfury he subsided into despair, and from despair to prostration. After he\r\nhad thrown himself for a few minutes to and fro convulsively on his\r\nbed, his nerveless arms fell quietly down; his head lay languidly on\r\nhis pillow; his limbs, exhausted with excessive emotion, still trembled\r\noccasionally, agitated by muscular contractions; while from his breast\r\nfaint and infrequent sighs still issued. Morpheus, the tutelary deity of\r\nthe apartment, towards whom Louis raised his eyes, wearied by his anger\r\nand reconciled by his tears, showered down upon him the sleep-inducing\r\npoppies with which his hands are ever filled; so presently the monarch\r\nclosed his eyes and fell asleep. Then it seemed to him, as it often\r\nhappens in that first sleep, so light and gentle, which raises the body\r\nabove the couch, and the soul above the earth--it seemed to him, we say,\r\nas if the god Morpheus, painted on the ceiling, looked at him with eyes\r\nresembling human eyes; that something shone brightly, and moved to and\r\nfro in the dome above the sleeper; that the crowd of terrible dreams\r\nwhich thronged together in his brain, and which were interrupted for\r\na moment, half revealed a human face, with a hand resting against the\r\nmouth, and in an attitude of deep and absorbed meditation. And strange\r\nenough, too, this man bore so wonderful a resemblance to the king\r\nhimself, that Louis fancied he was looking at his own face reflected in\r\na mirror; with the exception, however, that the face was saddened by a\r\nfeeling of the profoundest pity. Then it seemed to him as if the dome\r\ngradually retired, escaping from his gaze, and that the figures and\r\nattributes painted by Lebrun became darker and darker as the distance\r\nbecame more and more remote. A gentle, easy movement, as regular as\r\nthat by which a vessel plunges beneath the waves, had succeeded to the\r\nimmovableness of the bed. Doubtless the king was dreaming, and in this\r\ndream the crown of gold, which fastened the curtains together, seemed\r\nto recede from his vision, just as the dome, to which it remained\r\nsuspended, had done, so that the winged genius which, with both its\r\nhand, supported the crown, seemed, though vainly so, to call upon the\r\nking, who was fast disappearing from it. The bed still sunk. Louis,\r\nwith his eyes open, could not resist the deception of this cruel\r\nhallucination. At last, as the light of the royal chamber faded away\r\ninto darkness and gloom, something cold, gloomy, and inexplicable in\r\nits nature seemed to infect the air. No paintings, nor gold, nor velvet\r\nhangings, were visible any longer, nothing but walls of a dull gray\r\ncolor, which the increasing gloom made darker every moment. And yet the\r\nbed still continued to descend, and after a minute, which seemed in its\r\nduration almost an age to the king, it reached a stratum of air, black\r\nand chill as death, and then it stopped. The king could no longer see\r\nthe light in his room, except as from the bottom of a well we can see\r\nthe light of day. “I am under the influence of some atrocious dream,” he\r\nthought. “It is time to awaken from it. Come! let me wake.”\r\n\r\nEvery one has experienced the sensation the above remark conveys; there\r\nis hardly a person who, in the midst of a nightmare whose influence is\r\nsuffocating, has not said to himself, by the help of that light which\r\nstill burns in the brain when every human light is extinguished, “It is\r\nnothing but a dream, after all.” This was precisely what Louis XIV. said\r\nto himself; but when he said, “Come, come! wake up,” he perceived that\r\nnot only was he already awake, but still more, that he had his eyes open\r\nalso. And then he looked all round him. On his right hand and on his\r\nleft two armed men stood in stolid silence, each wrapped in a huge\r\ncloak, and the face covered with a mask; one of them held a small lamp\r\nin his hand, whose glimmering light revealed the saddest picture a king\r\ncould look upon. Louis could not help saying to himself that his dream\r\nstill lasted, and that all he had to do to cause it to disappear was\r\nto move his arms or to say something aloud; he darted from his bed, and\r\nfound himself upon the damp, moist ground. Then, addressing himself to\r\nthe man who held the lamp in his hand, he said:\r\n\r\n“What is this, monsieur, and what is the meaning of this jest?”\r\n\r\n“It is no jest,” replied in a deep voice the masked figure that held the\r\nlantern.\r\n\r\n“Do you belong to M. Fouquet?” inquired the king, greatly astonished at\r\nhis situation.\r\n\r\n“It matters very little to whom we belong,” said the phantom; “we are\r\nyour masters now, that is sufficient.”\r\n\r\nThe king, more impatient than intimidated, turned to the other masked\r\nfigure. “If this is a comedy,” he said, “you will tell M. Fouquet that I\r\nfind it unseemly and improper, and that I command it should cease.”\r\n\r\nThe second masked person to whom the king had addressed himself was a\r\nman of huge stature and vast circumference. He held himself erect and\r\nmotionless as any block of marble. “Well!” added the king, stamping his\r\nfoot, “you do not answer!”\r\n\r\n“We do not answer you, my good monsieur,” said the giant, in a\r\nstentorian voice, “because there is nothing to say.”\r\n\r\n“At least, tell me what you want,” exclaimed Louis, folding his arms\r\nwith a passionate gesture.\r\n\r\n“You will know by and by,” replied the man who held the lamp.\r\n\r\n“In the meantime tell me where I am.”\r\n\r\n“Look.”\r\n\r\nLouis looked all round him; but by the light of the lamp which the\r\nmasked figure raised for the purpose, he could perceive nothing but the\r\ndamp walls which glistened here and there with the slimy traces of the\r\nsnail. “Oh--oh!--a dungeon,” cried the king.\r\n\r\n“No, a subterranean passage.”\r\n\r\n“Which leads--?”\r\n\r\n“Will you be good enough to follow us?”\r\n\r\n“I shall not stir from hence!” cried the king.\r\n\r\n“If you are obstinate, my dear young friend,” replied the taller of the\r\ntwo, “I will lift you up in my arms, and roll you up in your own cloak,\r\nand if you should happen to be stifled, why--so much the worse for you.”\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he disengaged from beneath his cloak a hand of which\r\nMilo of Crotona would have envied him the possession, on the day when\r\nhe had that unhappy idea of rending his last oak. The king dreaded\r\nviolence, for he could well believe that the two men into whose power he\r\nhad fallen had not gone so far with any idea of drawing back, and\r\nthat they would consequently be ready to proceed to extremities, if\r\nnecessary. He shook his head and said: “It seems I have fallen into the\r\nhands of a couple of assassins. Move on, then.”\r\n\r\nNeither of the men answered a word to this remark. The one who carried\r\nthe lantern walked first, the king followed him, while the second masked\r\nfigure closed the procession. In this manner they passed along a winding\r\ngallery of some length, with as many staircases leading out of it as\r\nare to be found in the mysterious and gloomy palaces of Ann Radcliffe’s\r\ncreation. All these windings and turnings, during which the king heard\r\nthe sound of running water _over his head_, ended at last in a long\r\ncorridor closed by an iron door. The figure with the lamp opened the\r\ndoor with one of the keys he wore suspended at his girdle, where, during\r\nthe whole of the brief journey, the king had heard them rattle. As soon\r\nas the door was opened and admitted the air, Louis recognized the balmy\r\nodors that trees exhale in hot summer nights. He paused, hesitatingly,\r\nfor a moment or two; but the huge sentinel who followed him thrust him\r\nout of the subterranean passage.\r\n\r\n“Another blow,” said the king, turning towards the one who had just had\r\nthe audacity to touch his sovereign; “what do you intend to do with the\r\nking of France?”\r\n\r\n“Try to forget that word,” replied the man with the lamp, in a tone\r\nwhich as little admitted of a reply as one of the famous decrees of\r\nMinos.\r\n\r\n“You deserve to be broken on the wheel for the words that you have just\r\nmade use of,” said the giant, as he extinguished the lamp his companion\r\nhanded to him; “but the king is too kind-hearted.”\r\n\r\nLouis, at that threat, made so sudden a movement that it seemed as if\r\nhe meditated flight; but the giant’s hand was in a moment placed on\r\nhis shoulder, and fixed him motionless where he stood. “But tell me, at\r\nleast, where we are going,” said the king.\r\n\r\n“Come,” replied the former of the two men, with a kind of respect in his\r\nmanner, and leading his prisoner towards a carriage which seemed to be\r\nin waiting.\r\n\r\nThe carriage was completely concealed amid the trees. Two horses, with\r\ntheir feet fettered, were fastened by a halter to the lower branches of\r\na large oak.\r\n\r\n“Get in,” said the same man, opening the carriage-door and letting down\r\nthe step. The king obeyed, seated himself at the back of the carriage,\r\nthe padded door of which was shut and locked immediately upon him and\r\nhis guide. As for the giant, he cut the fastenings by which the horses\r\nwere bound, harnessed them himself, and mounted on the box of the\r\ncarriage, which was unoccupied. The carriage set off immediately at a\r\nquick trot, turned into the road to Paris, and in the forest of Senart\r\nfound a relay of horses fastened to the trees in the same manner the\r\nfirst horses had been, and without a postilion. The man on the box\r\nchanged the horses, and continued to follow the road towards Paris with\r\nthe same rapidity, so that they entered the city about three o’clock in\r\nthe morning. They carriage proceeded along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine,\r\nand, after having called out to the sentinel, “By the king’s order,” the\r\ndriver conducted the horses into the circular inclosure of the Bastile,\r\nlooking out upon the courtyard, called La Cour du Gouvernement. There\r\nthe horses drew up, reeking with sweat, at the flight of steps, and a\r\nsergeant of the guard ran forward. “Go and wake the governor,” said the\r\ncoachman in a voice of thunder.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of this voice, which might have been heard at the\r\nentrance of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, everything remained as calm in\r\nthe carriage as in the prison. Ten minutes afterwards, M. de Baisemeaux\r\nappeared in his dressing-gown on the threshold of the door. “What is the\r\nmatter now?” he asked; “and whom have you brought me there?”\r\n\r\nThe man with the lantern opened the carriage-door, and said two or three\r\nwords to the one who acted as driver, who immediately got down from his\r\nseat, took up a short musket which he kept under his feet, and placed\r\nits muzzle on his prisoner’s chest.\r\n\r\n“And fire at once if he speaks!” added aloud the man who alighted from\r\nthe carriage.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” replied his companion, without another remark.\r\n\r\nWith this recommendation, the person who had accompanied the king in the\r\ncarriage ascended the flight of steps, at the top of which the governor\r\nwas awaiting him. “Monsieur d’Herblay!” said the latter.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Aramis. “Let us go into your room.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! what brings you here at this hour?”\r\n\r\n“A mistake, my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux,” Aramis replied, quietly.\r\n“It appears that you were quite right the other day.”\r\n\r\n“What about?” inquired the governor.\r\n\r\n“About the order of release, my dear friend.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me what you mean, monsieur--no, monseigneur,” said the governor,\r\nalmost suffocated by surprise and terror.\r\n\r\n“It is a very simple affair: you remember, dear M. de Baisemeaux, that\r\nan order of release was sent to you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, for Marchiali.”\r\n\r\n“Very good! we both thought that it was for Marchiali?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; you will recollect, however, that I would not credit it, but\r\nthat you compelled me to believe it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Baisemeaux, my good fellow, what a word to make use of!--strongly\r\nrecommended, that was all.”\r\n\r\n“Strongly recommended, yes; strongly recommended to give him up to you;\r\nand that you carried him off with you in your carriage.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux, it was a mistake; it was\r\ndiscovered at the ministry, so that I now bring you an order from the\r\nking to set at liberty Seldon,--that poor Seldon fellow, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Seldon! are you sure this time?”\r\n\r\n“Well, read it yourself,” added Aramis, handing him the order.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Baisemeaux, “this order is the very same that has already\r\npassed through my hands.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“It is the very one I assured you I saw the other evening. _Parbleu!_ I\r\nrecognize it by the blot of ink.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know whether it is that; but all I know is, that I bring it\r\nfor you.”\r\n\r\n“But then, what about the other?”\r\n\r\n“What other?”\r\n\r\n“Marchiali.”\r\n\r\n“I have got him here with me.”\r\n\r\n“But that is not enough for me. I require a new order to take him back\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t talk such nonsense, my dear Baisemeaux; you talk like a child!\r\nWhere is the order you received respecting Marchiali?”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux ran to his iron chest and took it out. Aramis seized hold\r\nof it, coolly tore it in four pieces, held them to the lamp, and burnt\r\nthem. “Good heavens! what are you doing?” exclaimed Baisemeaux, in an\r\nextremity of terror.\r\n\r\n“Look at your position quietly, my good governor,” said Aramis, with\r\nimperturbable self-possession, “and you will see how very simple the\r\nwhole affair is. You no longer possess any order justifying Marchiali’s\r\nrelease.”\r\n\r\n“I am a lost man!”\r\n\r\n“Far from it, my good fellow, since I have brought Marchiali back to\r\nyou, and all accordingly is just the same as if he had never left.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the governor, completely overcome by terror.\r\n\r\n“Plain enough, you see; and you will go and shut him up immediately.”\r\n\r\n“I should think so, indeed.”\r\n\r\n“And you will hand over this Seldon to me, whose liberation is\r\nauthorized by this order. Do you understand?”\r\n\r\n“I--I--”\r\n\r\n“You do understand, I see,” said Aramis. “Very good.” Baisemeaux clapped\r\nhis hands together.\r\n\r\n“But why, at all events, after having taken Marchiali away from me, do\r\nyou bring him back again?” cried the unhappy governor, in a paroxysm of\r\nterror, and completely dumbfounded.\r\n\r\n“For a friend such as you are,” said Aramis--“for so devoted a servant,\r\nI have no secrets;” and he put his mouth close to Baisemeaux’s ear, as\r\nhe said, in a low tone of voice, “you know the resemblance between that\r\nunfortunate fellow, and--”\r\n\r\n“And the king?--yes!”\r\n\r\n“Very good; the first use that Marchiali made of his liberty was to\r\npersist--Can you guess what?”\r\n\r\n“How is it likely I should guess?”\r\n\r\n“To persist in saying that he was king of France; to dress himself up in\r\nclothes like those of the king; and then pretend to assume that he was\r\nthe king himself.”\r\n\r\n“Gracious heavens!”\r\n\r\n“That is the reason why I have brought him back again, my dear friend.\r\nHe is mad and lets every one see how mad he is.”\r\n\r\n“What is to be done, then?”\r\n\r\n“That is very simple; let no one hold any communication with him. You\r\nunderstand that when his peculiar style of madness came to the king’s\r\nears, the king, who had pitied his terrible affliction, and saw that\r\nall his kindness had been repaid by black ingratitude, became perfectly\r\nfurious; so that, now--and remember this very distinctly, dear Monsieur\r\nde Baisemeaux, for it concerns you most closely--so that there is now, I\r\nrepeat, sentence of death pronounced against all those who may allow\r\nhim to communicate with any one else but me or the king himself. You\r\nunderstand, Baisemeaux, sentence of death!”\r\n\r\n“You need not ask me whether I understand.”\r\n\r\n“And now, let us go down, and conduct this poor devil back to his\r\ndungeon again, unless you prefer he should come up here.”\r\n\r\n“What would be the good of that?”\r\n\r\n“It would be better, perhaps, to enter his name in the prison-book at\r\nonce!”\r\n\r\n“Of course, certainly; not a doubt of it.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, have him up.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux ordered the drums to be beaten and the bell to be rung, as\r\na warning to every one to retire, in order to avoid meeting a prisoner,\r\nabout whom it was desired to observe a certain mystery. Then, when the\r\npassages were free, he went to take the prisoner from the carriage, at\r\nwhose breast Porthos, faithful to the directions which had been given\r\nhim, still kept his musket leveled. “Ah! is that you, miserable wretch?”\r\n cried the governor, as soon as he perceived the king. “Very good, very\r\ngood.” And immediately, making the king get out of the carriage, he led\r\nhim, still accompanied by Porthos, who had not taken off his mask, and\r\nAramis, who again resumed his, up the stairs, to the second Bertaudiere,\r\nand opened the door of the room in which Philippe for six long years had\r\nbemoaned his existence. The king entered the cell without pronouncing a\r\nsingle word: he faltered in as limp and haggard as a rain-struck lily.\r\nBaisemeaux shut the door upon him, turned the key twice in the lock,\r\nand then returned to Aramis. “It is quite true,” he said, in a low tone,\r\n“that he bears a striking resemblance to the king; but less so than you\r\nsaid.”\r\n\r\n“So that,” said Aramis, “you would not have been deceived by the\r\nsubstitution of the one for the other?”\r\n\r\n“What a question!”\r\n\r\n“You are a most valuable fellow, Baisemeaux,” said Aramis; “and now, set\r\nSeldon free.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. I was going to forget that. I will go and give orders at\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! to-morrow will be time enough.”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow!--oh, no. This very minute.”\r\n\r\n“Well; go off to your affairs, I will go away to mine. But it is quite\r\nunderstood, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“What ‘is quite understood’?”\r\n\r\n“That no one is to enter the prisoner’s cell, expect with an order from\r\nthe king; an order which I will myself bring.”\r\n\r\n“Quite so. Adieu, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\nAramis returned to his companion. “Now, Porthos, my good fellow, back\r\nagain to Vaux, and as fast as possible.”\r\n\r\n“A man is light and easy enough, when he has faithfully served his king;\r\nand, in serving him, saved his country,” said Porthos. “The horses will\r\nbe as light as if our tissues were constructed of the wind of heaven.\r\nSo let us be off.” And the carriage, lightened of a prisoner, who might\r\nwell be--as he in fact was--very heavy in the sight of Aramis, passed\r\nacross the drawbridge of the Bastile, which was raised again immediately\r\nbehind it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII. A Night at the Bastile.\r\n\r\nPain, anguish, and suffering in human life are always in proportion to\r\nthe strength with which a man is endowed. We will not pretend to say\r\nthat Heaven always apportions to a man’s capability of endurance the\r\nanguish with which he afflicts him; for that, indeed, would not be true,\r\nsince Heaven permits the existence of death, which is, sometimes, the\r\nonly refuge open to those who are too closely pressed--too bitterly\r\nafflicted, as far as the body is concerned. Suffering is in proportion\r\nto the strength which has been accorded; in other words, the weak suffer\r\nmore, where the trial is the same, than the strong. And what are the\r\nelementary principles, we may ask, that compose human strength? Is it\r\nnot--more than anything else--exercise, habit, experience? We shall not\r\neven take the trouble to demonstrate this, for it is an axiom in morals,\r\nas in physics. When the young king, stupefied and crushed in every sense\r\nand feeling, found himself led to a cell in the Bastile, he fancied\r\ndeath itself is but a sleep; that it, too, has its dreams as well; that\r\nthe bed had broken through the flooring of his room at Vaux; that death\r\nhad resulted from the occurrence; and that, still carrying out his\r\ndream, the king, Louis XIV., now no longer living, was dreaming one\r\nof those horrors, impossible to realize in life, which is termed\r\ndethronement, imprisonment, and insult towards a sovereign who formerly\r\nwielded unlimited power. To be present at--an actual witness, too--of\r\nthis bitterness of death; to float, indecisively, in an incomprehensible\r\nmystery, between resemblance and reality; to hear everything, to\r\nsee everything, without interfering in a single detail of agonizing\r\nsuffering, was--so the king thought within himself--a torture far\r\nmore terrible, since it might last forever. “Is this what is termed\r\neternity--hell?” he murmured, at the moment the door was closed upon\r\nhim, which we remember Baisemeaux had shut with his own hands. He did\r\nnot even look round him; and in the room, leaning with his back\r\nagainst the wall, he allowed himself to be carried away by the terrible\r\nsupposition that he was already dead, as he closed his eyes, in order to\r\navoid looking upon something even worse still. “How can I have died?” he\r\nsaid to himself, sick with terror. “The bed might have been let down by\r\nsome artificial means? But no! I do not remember to have felt a bruise,\r\nnor any shock either. Would they not rather have poisoned me at my\r\nmeals, or with the fumes of wax, as they did my ancestress, Jeanne\r\nd’Albret?” Suddenly, the chill of the dungeons seemed to fall like a wet\r\ncloak upon Louis’s shoulders. “I have seen,” he said, “my father lying\r\ndead upon his funeral couch, in his regal robes. That pale face, so calm\r\nand worn; those hands, once so skillful, lying nerveless by his side;\r\nthose limbs stiffened by the icy grasp of death; nothing there betokened\r\na sleep that was disturbed by dreams. And yet, how numerous were the\r\ndreams which Heaven might have sent that royal corpse--him whom so many\r\nothers had preceded, hurried away by him into eternal death! No, that\r\nking was still the king: he was enthroned still upon that funeral\r\ncouch, as upon a velvet armchair; he had not abdicated one title of his\r\nmajesty. God, who had not punished him, cannot, will not punish me, who\r\nhave done nothing.” A strange sound attracted the young man’s attention.\r\nHe looked round him, and saw on the mantel-shelf, just below an enormous\r\ncrucifix, coarsely painted in fresco on the wall, a rat of enormous size\r\nengaged in nibbling a piece of dry bread, but fixing all the time, an\r\nintelligent and inquiring look upon the new occupant of the cell. The\r\nking could not resist a sudden impulse of fear and disgust: he moved\r\nback towards the door, uttering a loud cry; and as if he but needed this\r\ncry, which escaped from his breast almost unconsciously, to recognize\r\nhimself, Louis knew that he was alive and in full possession of his\r\nnatural senses. “A prisoner!” he cried. “I--I, a prisoner!” He looked\r\nround him for a bell to summon some one to him. “There are no bells in\r\nthe Bastile,” he said, “and it is in the Bastile I am imprisoned. In\r\nwhat way can I have been made a prisoner? It must have been owing to a\r\nconspiracy of M. Fouquet. I have been drawn to Vaux, as to a snare. M.\r\nFouquet cannot be acting alone in this affair. His agent--That voice\r\nthat I but just now heard was M. d’Herblay’s; I recognized it. Colbert\r\nwas right, then. But what is Fouquet’s object? To reign in my place and\r\nstead?--Impossible. Yet who knows!” thought the king, relapsing into\r\ngloom again. “Perhaps my brother, the Duc d’Orleans, is doing that which\r\nmy uncle wished to do during the whole of his life against my father.\r\nBut the queen?--My mother, too? And La Vallière? Oh! La Vallière, she\r\nwill have been abandoned to Madame. Dear, dear girl! Yes, it is--it must\r\nbe so. They have shut her up as they have me. We are separated forever!”\r\n And at this idea of separation the poor lover burst into a flood of\r\ntears and sobs and groans.\r\n\r\n“There is a governor in this place,” the king continued, in a fury of\r\npassion; “I will speak to him, I will summon him to me.”\r\n\r\nHe called--no voice replied to his. He seized hold of his chair, and\r\nhurled it against the massive oaken door. The wood resounded against the\r\ndoor, and awakened many a mournful echo in the profound depths of the\r\nstaircase; but from a human creature, none.\r\n\r\nThis was a fresh proof for the king of the slight regard in which he was\r\nheld at the Bastile. Therefore, when his first fit of anger had passed\r\naway, having remarked a barred window through which there passed a\r\nstream of light, lozenge-shaped, which must be, he knew, the bright orb\r\nof approaching day, Louis began to call out, at first gently enough,\r\nthen louder and louder still; but no one replied. Twenty other attempts\r\nwhich he made, one after another, obtained no other or better success.\r\nHis blood began to boil within him, and mount to his head. His nature\r\nwas such, that, accustomed to command, he trembled at the idea of\r\ndisobedience. The prisoner broke the chair, which was too heavy for him\r\nto lift, and made use of it as a battering ram to strike against the\r\ndoor. He struck so loudly, and so repeatedly, that the perspiration soon\r\nbegan to pour down his face. The sound became tremendous and continuous;\r\ncertain stifled, smothered cries replied in different directions. This\r\nsound produced a strange effect upon the king. He paused to listen;\r\nit was the voice of the prisoners, formerly his victims, now his\r\ncompanions. The voices ascended like vapors through the thick ceilings\r\nand the massive walls, and rose in accusations against the author of\r\nthis noise, as doubtless their sighs and tears accused, in whispered\r\ntones, the author of their captivity. After having deprived so many\r\npeople of their liberty, the king came among them to rob them of their\r\nrest. This idea almost drove him mad; it redoubled his strength, or\r\nrather his will, bent upon obtaining some information, or a conclusion\r\nto the affair. With a portion of the broken chair he recommenced the\r\nnoise. At the end of an hour, Louis heard something in the corridor,\r\nbehind the door of his cell, and a violent blow, which was returned upon\r\nthe door itself, made him cease his own.\r\n\r\n“Are you mad?” said a rude, brutal voice. “What is the matter with you\r\nthis morning?”\r\n\r\n“This morning!” thought the king; but he said aloud, politely,\r\n“Monsieur, are you the governor of the Bastile?”\r\n\r\n“My good fellow, your head is out of sorts,” replied the voice; “but\r\nthat is no reason why you should make such a terrible disturbance. Be\r\nquiet; _mordioux!_”\r\n\r\n“Are you the governor?” the king inquired again.\r\n\r\nHe heard a door on the corridor close; the jailer had just left, not\r\ncondescending to reply a single word. When the king had assured himself\r\nof his departure, his fury knew no longer any bounds. As agile as a\r\ntiger, he leaped from the table to the window, and struck the iron bars\r\nwith all his might. He broke a pane of glass, the pieces of which\r\nfell clanking into the courtyard below. He shouted with increasing\r\nhoarseness, “The governor, the governor!” This excess lasted fully an\r\nhour, during which time he was in a burning fever. With his hair in\r\ndisorder and matted on his forehead, his dress torn and covered with\r\ndust and plaster, his linen in shreds, the king never rested until\r\nhis strength was utterly exhausted, and it was not until then that he\r\nclearly understood the pitiless thickness of the walls, the impenetrable\r\nnature of the cement, invincible to every influence but that of time,\r\nand that he possessed no other weapon but despair. He leaned his\r\nforehead against the door, and let the feverish throbbings of his heart\r\ncalm by degrees; it had seemed as if one single additional pulsation\r\nwould have made it burst.\r\n\r\n“A moment will come when the food which is given to the prisoners will\r\nbe brought to me. I shall then see some one, I shall speak to him, and\r\nget an answer.”\r\n\r\nAnd the king tried to remember at what hour the first repast of the\r\nprisoners was served at the Bastile; he was ignorant even of this\r\ndetail. The feeling of remorse at this remembrance smote him like the\r\nthrust of a dagger, that he should have lived for five and twenty years\r\na king, and in the enjoyment of every happiness, without having bestowed\r\na moment’s thought on the misery of those who had been unjustly deprived\r\nof their liberty. The king blushed for very shame. He felt that Heaven,\r\nin permitting this fearful humiliation, did no more than render to the\r\nman the same torture as had been inflicted by that man upon so many\r\nothers. Nothing could be more efficacious for reawakening his mind to\r\nreligious influences than the prostration of his heart and mind and soul\r\nbeneath the feeling of such acute wretchedness. But Louis dared not even\r\nkneel in prayer to God to entreat him to terminate his bitter trial.\r\n\r\n“Heaven is right,” he said; “Heaven acts wisely. It would be cowardly\r\nto pray to Heaven for that which I have so often refused my own\r\nfellow-creatures.”\r\n\r\nHe had reached this stage of his reflections, that is, of his agony of\r\nmind, when a similar noise was again heard behind his door, followed\r\nthis time by the sound of the key in the lock, and of the bolts being\r\nwithdrawn from their staples. The king bounded forward to be nearer to\r\nthe person who was about to enter, but, suddenly reflecting that it was\r\na movement unworthy of a sovereign, he paused, assumed a noble and calm\r\nexpression, which for him was easy enough, and waited with his back\r\nturned towards the window, in order, to some extent, to conceal his\r\nagitation from the eyes of the person who was about to enter. It was\r\nonly a jailer with a basket of provisions. The king looked at the man\r\nwith restless anxiety, and waited until he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the latter, “you have broken your chair. I said you had done\r\nso! Why, you have gone quite mad.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the king, “be careful what you say; it will be a very\r\nserious affair for you.”\r\n\r\nThe jailer placed the basket on the table, and looked at his prisoner\r\nsteadily. “What do you say?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Desire the governor to come to me,” added the king, in accents full of\r\ncalm and dignity.\r\n\r\n“Come, my boy,” said the turnkey, “you have always been very quiet and\r\nreasonable, but you are getting vicious, it seems, and I wish you\r\nto know it in time. You have broken your chair, and made a great\r\ndisturbance; that is an offense punishable by imprisonment in one of the\r\nlower dungeons. Promise me not to begin over again, and I will not say a\r\nword about it to the governor.”\r\n\r\n“I wish to see the governor,” replied the king, still governing his\r\npassions.\r\n\r\n“He will send you off to one of the dungeons, I tell you; so take care.”\r\n\r\n“I insist upon it, do you hear?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! ah! your eyes are becoming wild again. Very good! I shall take away\r\nyour knife.”\r\n\r\nAnd the jailer did what he said, quitted the prisoner, and closed the\r\ndoor, leaving the king more astounded, more wretched, more isolated than\r\never. It was useless, though he tried it, to make the same noise again\r\non his door, and equally useless that he threw the plates and dishes out\r\nof the window; not a single sound was heard in recognition. Two hours\r\nafterwards he could not be recognized as a king, a gentleman, a man, a\r\nhuman being; he might rather be called a madman, tearing the door with\r\nhis nails, trying to tear up the flooring of his cell, and uttering such\r\nwild and fearful cries that the old Bastile seemed to tremble to its\r\nvery foundations for having revolted against its master. As for the\r\ngovernor, the jailer did not even think of disturbing him; the turnkeys\r\nand the sentinels had reported the occurrence to him, but what was the\r\ngood of it? Were not these madmen common enough in such a prison?\r\nand were not the walls still stronger? M. de Baisemeaux, thoroughly\r\nimpressed with what Aramis had told him, and in perfect conformity with\r\nthe king’s order, hoped only that one thing might happen; namely, that\r\nthe madman Marchiali might be mad enough to hang himself to the canopy\r\nof his bed, or to one of the bars of the window. In fact, the prisoner\r\nwas anything but a profitable investment for M. Baisemeaux, and became\r\nmore annoying than agreeable to him. These complications of Seldon\r\nand Marchiali--the complications first of setting at liberty and then\r\nimprisoning again, the complications arising from the strong likeness in\r\nquestion--had at last found a very proper _denouement_. Baisemeaux\r\neven thought he had remarked that D’Herblay himself was not altogether\r\ndissatisfied with the result.\r\n\r\n“And then, really,” said Baisemeaux to his next in command, “an ordinary\r\nprisoner is already unhappy enough in being a prisoner; he suffers quite\r\nenough, indeed, to induce one to hope, charitably enough, that his death\r\nmay not be far distant. With still greater reason, accordingly, when the\r\nprisoner has gone mad, and might bite and make a terrible disturbance\r\nin the Bastile; why, in such a case, it is not simply an act of mere\r\ncharity to wish him dead; it would be almost a good and even commendable\r\naction, quietly to have him put out of his misery.”\r\n\r\nAnd the good-natured governor thereupon sat down to his late breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XIX. The Shadow of M. Fouquet.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, still confused and oppressed by the conversation he had just\r\nhad with the king, could not resist asking himself if he were really in\r\npossession of his senses, if he were really and truly at Vaux; if he,\r\nD’Artagnan, were really the captain of the musketeers, and M. Fouquet\r\nthe owner of the chateau in which Louis XIV. was at that moment\r\npartaking of his hospitality. These reflections were not those of a\r\ndrunken man, although everything was in prodigal profusion at Vaux, and\r\nthe surintendant’s wines had met with a distinguished reception at the\r\n_fete_. The Gascon, however, was a man of calm self-possession; and no\r\nsooner did he touch his bright steel blade, than he knew how to adopt\r\nmorally the cold, keen weapon as his guide of action.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, as he quitted the royal apartment, “I seem now to\r\nbe mixed up historically with the destinies of the king and of the\r\nminister; it will be written, that M. d’Artagnan, a younger son of a\r\nGascon family, placed his hand on the shoulder of M. Nicolas Fouquet,\r\nthe surintendant of the finances of France. My descendants, if I have\r\nany, will flatter themselves with the distinction which this arrest\r\nwill confer, just as the members of the De Luynes family have done with\r\nregard to the estates of the poor Marechal d’Ancre. But the thing is,\r\nhow best to execute the king’s directions in a proper manner. Any man\r\nwould know how to say to M. Fouquet, ‘Your sword, monsieur.’ But it\r\nis not every one who would be able to take care of M. Fouquet without\r\nothers knowing anything about it. How am I to manage, then, so that M.\r\nle surintendant pass from the height of favor to the direst disgrace;\r\nthat Vaux be turned into a dungeon for him; that after having been\r\nsteeped to his lips, as it were, in all the perfumes and incense of\r\nAhasuerus, he is transferred to the gallows of Haman; in other words, of\r\nEnguerrand de Marigny?” And at this reflection, D’Artagnan’s brow became\r\nclouded with perplexity. The musketeer had certain scruples on the\r\nmatter, it must be admitted. To deliver up to death (for not a doubt\r\nexisted that Louis hated Fouquet mortally) the man who had just shown\r\nhimself so delightful and charming a host in every way, was a real\r\ninsult to one’s conscience. “It almost seems,” said D’Artagnan to\r\nhimself, “that if I am not a poor, mean, miserable fellow, I should let\r\nM. Fouquet know the opinion the king has about him. Yet, if I betray\r\nmy master’s secret, I shall be a false-hearted, treacherous knave, a\r\ntraitor, too, a crime provided for and punishable by military laws--so\r\nmuch so, indeed, that twenty times, in former days when wars were rife,\r\nI have seen many a miserable fellow strung up to a tree for doing, in\r\nbut a small degree, what my scruples counsel me to undertake upon a\r\ngreat scale now. No, I think that a man of true readiness of wit ought\r\nto get out of this difficulty with more skill than that. And now, let\r\nus admit that I do possess a little readiness of invention; it is not at\r\nall certain, though, for, after having for forty years absorbed so\r\nlarge a quantity, I shall be lucky if there were to be a pistole’s-worth\r\nleft.” D’Artagnan buried his head in his hands, tore at his mustache\r\nin sheer vexation, and added, “What can be the reason of M. Fouquet’s\r\ndisgrace? There seem to be three good ones: the first, because M.\r\nColbert doesn’t like him; the second, because he wished to fall in love\r\nwith Mademoiselle de la Vallière; and lastly, because the king likes M.\r\nColbert and loves Mademoiselle de la Vallière. Oh! he is lost! But shall\r\nI put my foot on his neck, I, of all men, when he is falling a prey\r\nto the intrigues of a pack of women and clerks? For shame! If he\r\nbe dangerous, I will lay him low enough; if, however, he be\r\nonly persecuted, I will look on. I have come to such a decisive\r\ndetermination, that neither king nor living man shall change my mind.\r\nIf Athos were here, he would do as I have done. Therefore, instead of\r\ngoing, in cold blood, up to M. Fouquet, and arresting him off-hand and\r\nshutting him up altogether, I will try and conduct myself like a man who\r\nunderstands what good manners are. People will talk about it, of course;\r\nbut they shall talk well of it, I am determined.” And D’Artagnan,\r\ndrawing by a gesture peculiar to himself his shoulder-belt over his\r\nshoulder, went straight off to M. Fouquet, who, after he had taken\r\nleave of his guests, was preparing to retire for the night and to sleep\r\ntranquilly after the triumphs of the day. The air was still perfumed,\r\nor infected, whichever way it may be considered, with the odors of\r\nthe torches and the fireworks. The wax-lights were dying away in their\r\nsockets, the flowers fell unfastened from the garlands, the groups of\r\ndancers and courtiers were separating in the salons. Surrounded by his\r\nfriends, who complimented him and received his flattering remarks in\r\nreturn, the surintendant half-closed his wearied eyes. He longed for\r\nrest and quiet; he sank upon the bed of laurels which had been heaped\r\nup for him for so many days past; it might almost have been said that he\r\nseemed bowed beneath the weight of the new debts which he had incurred\r\nfor the purpose of giving the greatest possible honor to this _fete_.\r\nFouquet had just retired to his room, still smiling, but more than\r\nhalf-asleep. He could listen to nothing more, he could hardly keep his\r\neyes open; his bed seemed to possess a fascinating and irresistible\r\nattraction for him. The god Morpheus, the presiding deity of the dome\r\npainted by Lebrun, had extended his influence over the adjoining rooms,\r\nand showered down his most sleep-inducing poppies upon the master of the\r\nhouse. Fouquet, almost entirely alone, was being assisted by his _valet\r\nde chambre_ to undress, when M. d’Artagnan appeared at the entrance of\r\nthe room. D’Artagnan had never been able to succeed in making himself\r\ncommon at the court; and notwithstanding he was seen everywhere and\r\non all occasions, he never failed to produce an effect wherever and\r\nwhenever he made his appearance. Such is the happy privilege of certain\r\nnatures, which in that respect resemble either thunder or lightning;\r\nevery one recognizes them; but their appearance never fails to arouse\r\nsurprise and astonishment, and whenever they occur, the impression is\r\nalways left that the last was the most conspicuous or most important.\r\n\r\n“What! M. d’Artagnan?” said Fouquet, who had already taken his right arm\r\nout of the sleeve of his doublet.\r\n\r\n“At your service,” replied the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“Come in, my dear M. d’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\n“Have you come to criticise the _fete?_ You are ingenious enough in your\r\ncriticisms, I know.”\r\n\r\n“By no means.”\r\n\r\n“Are not your men looked after properly?”\r\n\r\n“In every way.”\r\n\r\n“You are not comfortably lodged, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be better.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, I have to thank you for being so amiably disposed, and I\r\nmust not fail to express my obligations to you for all your flattering\r\nkindness.”\r\n\r\nThese words were as much as to say, “My dear D’Artagnan, pray go to bed,\r\nsince you have a bed to lie down on, and let me do the same.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan did not seem to understand it.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to bed already?” he said to the superintendent.\r\n\r\n“Yes; have you anything to say to me?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, monsieur, nothing at all. You sleep in this room, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; as you see.”\r\n\r\n“You have given a most charming _fete_ to the king.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! beautiful!”\r\n\r\n“Is the king pleased?”\r\n\r\n“Enchanted.”\r\n\r\n“Did he desire you to say as much to me?”\r\n\r\n“He would not choose so unworthy a messenger, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“You do not do yourself justice, Monsieur d’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“Is that your bed, there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but why do you ask? Are you not satisfied with your own?”\r\n\r\n“My I speak frankly to you?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I am not.”\r\n\r\nFouquet started; and then replied, “Will you take my room, Monsieur\r\nd’Artagnan?”\r\n\r\n“What! deprive you of it, monseigneur? never!”\r\n\r\n“What am I to do, then?”\r\n\r\n“Allow me to share yours with you.”\r\n\r\nFouquet looked at the musketeer fixedly. “Ah! ah!” he said, “you have\r\njust left the king.”\r\n\r\n“I have, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“And the king wishes you to pass the night in my room?”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur--”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Monsieur d’Artagnan, very well. You are the master here.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you, monseigneur, that I do not wish to abuse--”\r\n\r\nFouquet turned to his valet, and said, “Leave us.” When the man had\r\nleft, he said to D’Artagnan, “You have something to say to me?”\r\n\r\n“I?”\r\n\r\n“A man of your superior intelligence cannot have come to talk with a man\r\nlike myself, at such an hour as the present, without grave motives.”\r\n\r\n“Do not interrogate me.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary. What do you want with me?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing more than the pleasure of your society.”\r\n\r\n“Come into the garden, then,” said the superintendent suddenly, “or into\r\nthe park.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the musketeer, hastily, “no.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“The fresh air--”\r\n\r\n“Come, admit at once that you arrest me,” said the superintendent to the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n“Never!” said the latter.\r\n\r\n“You intend to look after me, then?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur, I do, upon my honor.”\r\n\r\n“Upon your honor--ah! that is quite another thing! So I am to be\r\narrested in my own house.”\r\n\r\n“Do not say such a thing.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I will proclaim it aloud.”\r\n\r\n“If you do so, I shall be compelled to request you to be silent.”\r\n\r\n“Very good! Violence towards me, and in my own house, too.”\r\n\r\n“We do not seem to understand one another at all. Stay a moment; there\r\nis a chess-board there; we will have a game, if you have no objections.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan, I am in disgrace, then?”\r\n\r\n“Not at all; but--”\r\n\r\n“I am prohibited, I suppose, from withdrawing from your sight.”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand a word you are saying, monseigneur; and if you wish\r\nme to withdraw, tell me so.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, your mode of action is enough to drive\r\nme mad; I was almost sinking for want of sleep, but you have completely\r\nawakened me.”\r\n\r\n“I shall never forgive myself, I am sure; and if you wish to reconcile\r\nme with myself, why, go to sleep in your bed in my presence; and I shall\r\nbe delighted.”\r\n\r\n“I am under surveillance, I see.”\r\n\r\n“I will leave the room if you say any such thing.”\r\n\r\n“You are beyond my comprehension.”\r\n\r\n“Good night, monseigneur,” said D’Artagnan, as he pretended to withdraw.\r\n\r\nFouquet ran after him. “I will not lie down,” he said. “Seriously, and\r\nsince you refuse to treat me as a man, and since you finesse with me, I\r\nwill try and set you at bay, as a hunter does a wild boar.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” cried D’Artagnan, pretending to smile.\r\n\r\n“I shall order my horses, and set off for Paris,” said Fouquet, sounding\r\nthe captain of the musketeers.\r\n\r\n“If that be the case, monseigneur, it is very difficult.”\r\n\r\n“You will arrest me, then?”\r\n\r\n“No, but I shall go along with you.”\r\n\r\n“That is quite sufficient, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” returned Fouquet,\r\ncoldly. “It was not for nothing you acquired your reputation as a man\r\nof intelligence and resource; but with me all this is quite superfluous.\r\nLet us come to the point. Do me a service. Why do you arrest me? What\r\nhave I done?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I know nothing about what you may have done; but I do not arrest\r\nyou--this evening, at least!”\r\n\r\n“This evening!” said Fouquet, turning pale, “but to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“It is not to-morrow just yet, monseigneur. Who can ever answer for the\r\nmorrow?”\r\n\r\n“Quick, quick, captain! let me speak to M. d’Herblay.”\r\n\r\n“Alas! that is quite impossible, monseigneur. I have strict orders to\r\nsee that you hold no communication with any one.”\r\n\r\n“With M. d’Herblay, captain--with your friend!”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, is M. d’Herblay the only person with whom you ought to be\r\nprevented holding any communication?”\r\n\r\nFouquet colored, and then assuming an air of resignation, he said: “You\r\nare right, monsieur; you have taught me a lesson I ought not to have\r\nevoked. A fallen man cannot assert his right to anything, even from\r\nthose whose fortunes he may have made; for a still stronger reason,\r\nhe cannot claim anything from those to whom he may never have had the\r\nhappiness of doing a service.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur!”\r\n\r\n“It is perfectly true, Monsieur d’Artagnan; you have always acted in\r\nthe most admirable manner towards me--in such a manner, indeed, as most\r\nbecomes the man who is destined to arrest me. You, at least, have never\r\nasked me anything.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied the Gascon, touched by his eloquent and noble tone\r\nof grief, “will you--I ask it as a favor--pledge me your word as a man\r\nof honor that you will not leave this room?”\r\n\r\n“What is the use of it, dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, since you keep watch\r\nand ward over me? Do you suppose I should contend against the most\r\nvaliant sword in the kingdom?”\r\n\r\n“It is not that, at all, monseigneur; but that I am going to look for M.\r\nd’Herblay, and, consequently, to leave you alone.”\r\n\r\nFouquet uttered a cry of delight and surprise.\r\n\r\n“To look for M. d’Herblay! to leave me alone!” he exclaimed, clasping\r\nhis hands together.\r\n\r\n“Which is M. d’Herblay’s room? The blue room is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend, yes.”\r\n\r\n“Your friend! thank you for that word, monseigneur; you confer it upon\r\nme to-day, at least, if you have never done so before.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you have saved me.”\r\n\r\n“It will take a good ten minutes to go from hence to the blue room, and\r\nto return?” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Nearly so.”\r\n\r\n“And then to wake Aramis, who sleeps very soundly, when he is asleep,\r\nI put that down at another five minutes; making a total of fifteen\r\nminutes’ absence. And now, monseigneur, give me your word that you will\r\nnot in any way attempt to make your escape, and that when I return I\r\nshall find you here again.”\r\n\r\n“I give it, monsieur,” replied Fouquet, with an expression of the\r\nwarmest and deepest gratitude.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan disappeared. Fouquet looked at him as he quitted the room,\r\nwaited with a feverish impatience until the door was closed behind him,\r\nand as soon as it was shut, flew to his keys, opened two or three secret\r\ndoors concealed in various articles of furniture in the room, looked\r\nvainly for certain papers, which doubtless he had left at Saint-Mande,\r\nand which he seemed to regret not having found in them; then hurriedly\r\nseizing hold of letters, contracts, papers, writings, he heaped them\r\nup into a pile, which he burnt in the extremest haste upon the marble\r\nhearth of the fireplace, not even taking time to draw from the interior\r\nof it the vases and pots of flowers with which it was filled. As soon as\r\nhe had finished, like a man who has just escaped an imminent danger, and\r\nwhose strength abandons him as soon as the danger is past, he sank down,\r\ncompletely overcome, on a couch. When D’Artagnan returned, he found\r\nFouquet in the same position; the worthy musketeer had not the slightest\r\ndoubt that Fouquet, having given his word, would not even think of\r\nfailing to keep it, but he had thought it most likely that Fouquet would\r\nturn his (D’Artagnan’s) absence to the best advantage in getting rid of\r\nall the papers, memorandums, and contracts, which might possibly render\r\nhis position, which was even now serious enough, more dangerous than\r\never. And so, lifting up his head like a dog who has regained the scent,\r\nhe perceived an odor resembling smoke he had relied on finding in the\r\natmosphere, and having found it, made a movement of his head in token\r\nof satisfaction. As D’Artagnan entered, Fouquet, on his side, raised his\r\nhead, and not one of D’Artagnan’s movements escaped him. And then the\r\nlooks of the two men met, and they both saw that they had understood\r\neach other without exchanging a syllable.\r\n\r\n“Well!” asked Fouquet, the first to speak, “and M. d’Herblay?”\r\n\r\n“Upon my word, monseigneur,” replied D’Artagnan, “M. d’Herblay must\r\nbe desperately fond of walking out at night, and composing verses\r\nby moonlight in the park of Vaux, with some of your poets, in all\r\nprobability, for he is not in his own room.”\r\n\r\n“What! not in his own room?” cried Fouquet, whose last hope thus escaped\r\nhim; for unless he could ascertain in what way the bishop of Vannes\r\ncould assist him, he perfectly well knew that he could expect assistance\r\nfrom no other quarter.\r\n\r\n“Or, indeed,” continued D’Artagnan, “if he is in his own room, he has\r\nvery good reasons for not answering.”\r\n\r\n“But surely you did not call him in such a manner that he could have\r\nheard you?”\r\n\r\n“You can hardly suppose, monseigneur, that having already exceeded my\r\norders, which forbade me leaving you a single moment--you can hardly\r\nsuppose, I say, that I should have been mad enough to rouse the whole\r\nhouse and allow myself to be seen in the corridor of the bishop of\r\nVannes, in order that M. Colbert might state with positive certainty\r\nthat I gave you time to burn your papers.”\r\n\r\n“My papers?”\r\n\r\n“Of course; at least that is what I should have done in your place. When\r\nany one opens a door for me I always avail myself of it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, and I thank you, for I have availed myself of it.”\r\n\r\n“And you have done perfectly right. Every man has his own peculiar\r\nsecrets with which others have nothing to do. But let us return to\r\nAramis, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, I tell you, you could not have called loud enough, or\r\nAramis would have heard you.”\r\n\r\n“However softly any one may call Aramis, monseigneur, Aramis always\r\nhears when he has an interest in hearing. I repeat what I said\r\nbefore--Aramis was not in his own room, or Aramis had certain reasons\r\nfor not recognizing my voice, of which I am ignorant, and of which you\r\nmay be even ignorant yourself, notwithstanding your liege-man is His\r\nGreatness the Lord Bishop of Vannes.”\r\n\r\nFouquet drew a deep sigh, rose from his seat, took three or four turns\r\nin his room, and finished by seating himself, with an expression of\r\nextreme dejection, upon his magnificent bed with velvet hangings,\r\nand costliest lace. D’Artagnan looked at Fouquet with feelings of the\r\ndeepest and sincerest pity.\r\n\r\n“I have seen a good many men arrested in my life,” said the musketeer,\r\nsadly; “I have seen both M. de Cinq-Mars and M. de Chalais arrested,\r\nthough I was very young then. I have seen M. de Conde arrested with\r\nthe princes; I have seen M. de Retz arrested; I have seen M. Broussel\r\narrested. Stay a moment, monseigneur, it is disagreeable to have to say,\r\nbut the very one of all those whom you most resemble at this moment was\r\nthat poor fellow Broussel. You were very near doing as he did, putting\r\nyour dinner napkin in your portfolio, and wiping your mouth with your\r\npapers. _Mordioux!_ Monseigneur Fouquet, a man like you ought not to be\r\ndejected in this manner. Suppose your friends saw you?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” returned the surintendant, with a smile full\r\nof gentleness, “you do not understand me; it is precisely because my\r\nfriends are not looking on, that I am as you see me now. I do not live,\r\nexist even, isolated from others; I am nothing when left to myself.\r\nUnderstand that throughout my whole life I have passed every moment of\r\nmy time in making friends, whom I hoped to render my stay and support.\r\nIn times of prosperity, all these cheerful, happy voices--rendered so\r\nthrough and by my means--formed in my honor a concert of praise and\r\nkindly actions. In the least disfavor, these humbler voices accompanied\r\nin harmonious accents the murmur of my own heart. Isolation I have never\r\nyet known. Poverty (a phantom I have sometimes beheld, clad in rags,\r\nawaiting me at the end of my journey through life)--poverty has been the\r\nspecter with which many of my own friends have trifled for years past,\r\nwhich they poetize and caress, and which has attracted me towards them.\r\nPoverty! I accept it, acknowledge it, receive it, as a disinherited\r\nsister; for poverty is neither solitude, nor exile, nor imprisonment.\r\nIs it likely I shall ever be poor, with such friends as Pelisson, as\r\nLa Fontaine, as Moliere? with such a mistress as--Oh! if you knew how\r\nutterly lonely and desolate I feel at this moment, and how you, who\r\nseparate me from all I love, seem to resemble the image of solitude, of\r\nannihilation--death itself.”\r\n\r\n“But I have already told you, Monsieur Fouquet,” replied D’Artagnan,\r\nmoved to the depths of his soul, “that you are woefully exaggerating.\r\nThe king likes you.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Fouquet, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“M. Colbert hates you.”\r\n\r\n“M. Colbert! What does that matter to me?”\r\n\r\n“He will ruin you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I defy him to do that, for I am ruined already.”\r\n\r\nAt this singular confession of the superintendent, D’Artagnan cast\r\nhis glance all round the room; and although he did not open his lips,\r\nFouquet understood him so thoroughly, that he added: “What can be done\r\nwith such wealth of substance as surrounds us, when a man can no longer\r\ncultivate his taste for the magnificent? Do you know what good the\r\ngreater part of the wealth and the possessions which we rich enjoy,\r\nconfer upon us? merely to disgust us, by their very splendor even, with\r\neverything which does not equal it! Vaux! you will say, and the wonders\r\nof Vaux! What of it? What boot these wonders? If I am ruined, how shall\r\nI fill with water the urns which my Naiads bear in their arms, or\r\nforce the air into the lungs of my Tritons? To be rich enough, Monsieur\r\nd’Artagnan, a man must be too rich.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Oh! I know very well what you think,” replied Fouquet, quickly. “If\r\nVaux were yours, you would sell it, and would purchase an estate in the\r\ncountry; an estate which should have woods, orchards, and land attached,\r\nso that the estate should be made to support its master. With forty\r\nmillions you might--”\r\n\r\n“Ten millions,” interrupted D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Not a million, my dear captain. No one in France is rich enough to give\r\ntwo millions for Vaux, and to continue to maintain it as I have done; no\r\none could do it, no one would know how.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said D’Artagnan, “in any case, a million is not abject misery.”\r\n\r\n“It is not far from it, my dear monsieur. But you do not understand me.\r\nNo; I will not sell my residence at Vaux; I will give it to you, if\r\nyou like;” and Fouquet accompanied these words with a movement of the\r\nshoulders to which it would be impossible to do justice.\r\n\r\n“Give it to the king; you will make a better bargain.”\r\n\r\n“The king does not require me to give it to him,” said Fouquet; “he\r\nwill take it away from me with the most absolute ease and grace, if it\r\npleases him to do so; and that is the very reason I should prefer to see\r\nit perish. Do you know, Monsieur d’Artagnan, that if the king did not\r\nhappen to be under my roof, I would take this candle, go straight to the\r\ndome, and set fire to a couple of huge chests of fusees and fireworks\r\nwhich are in reserve there, and would reduce my palace to ashes.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said the musketeer, negligently. “At all events, you would not be\r\nable to burn the gardens, and that is the finest feature of the place.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” resumed Fouquet, thoughtfully, “what was I saying? Great\r\nheavens! burn Vaux! destroy my palace! But Vaux is not mine; these\r\nwonderful creations are, it is true, the property, as far as sense of\r\nenjoyment goes, of the man who has paid for them; but as far as duration\r\nis concerned, they belong to those who created them. Vaux belongs to\r\nLebrun, to Lenotre, to Pelisson, to Levau, to La Fontaine, to Moliere;\r\nVaux belongs to posterity, in fact. You see, Monsieur d’Artagnan, that\r\nmy very house has ceased to be my own.”\r\n\r\n“That is all well and good,” said D’Artagnan; “the idea is agreeable\r\nenough, and I recognize M. Fouquet himself in it. That idea, indeed,\r\nmakes me forget that poor fellow Broussel altogether; and I now fail to\r\nrecognize in you the whining complaints of that old Frondeur. If you are\r\nruined, monsieur, look at the affair manfully, for you too, _mordioux!_\r\nbelong to posterity, and have no right to lessen yourself in any way.\r\nStay a moment; look at me, I who seem to exercise in some degree a\r\nkind of superiority over you, because I am arresting you; fate, which\r\ndistributes their different parts to the comedians of this world,\r\naccorded me a less agreeable and less advantageous part to fill than\r\nyours has been. I am one of those who think that the parts which kings\r\nand powerful nobles are called upon to act are infinitely of more worth\r\nthan the parts of beggars or lackeys. It is far better on the stage--on\r\nthe stage, I mean, of another theater than the theater of this world--it\r\nis far better to wear a fine coat and to talk a fine language, than to\r\nwalk the boards shod with a pair of old shoes, or to get one’s backbone\r\ngently polished by a hearty dressing with a stick. In one word, you have\r\nbeen a prodigal with money, you have ordered and been obeyed--have been\r\nsteeped to the lips in enjoyment; while I have dragged my tether after\r\nme, have been commanded and have obeyed, and have drudged my life\r\naway. Well, although I may seem of such trifling importance beside you,\r\nmonseigneur, I do declare to you, that the recollection of what I have\r\ndone serves me as a spur, and prevents me from bowing my old head too\r\nsoon. I shall remain unto the very end a trooper; and when my turn\r\ncomes, I shall fall perfectly straight, all in a heap, still alive,\r\nafter having selected my place beforehand. Do as I do, Monsieur Fouquet,\r\nyou will not find yourself the worse for it; a fall happens only once\r\nin a lifetime to men like yourself, and the chief thing is, to take\r\nit gracefully when the chance presents itself. There is a Latin\r\nproverb--the words have escaped me, but I remember the sense of it very\r\nwell, for I have thought over it more than once--which says, ‘The end\r\ncrowns the work!’”\r\n\r\nFouquet rose from his seat, passed his arm round D’Artagnan’s neck, and\r\nclasped him in a close embrace, whilst with the other hand he pressed\r\nhis hand. “An excellent homily,” he said, after a moment’s pause.\r\n\r\n“A soldier’s, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“You have a regard for me, in telling me all that.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps.”\r\n\r\nFouquet resumed his pensive attitude once more, and then, a moment\r\nafter, he said: “Where can M. d’Herblay be? I dare not ask you to send\r\nfor him.”\r\n\r\n“You would not ask me, because I would not do it, Monsieur Fouquet.\r\nPeople would learn it, and Aramis, who is not mixed up with the affair,\r\nmight possibly be compromised and included in your disgrace.”\r\n\r\n“I will wait here till daylight,” said Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Yes; that is best.”\r\n\r\n“What shall we do when daylight comes?”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing at all about it, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan, will you do me a favor?”\r\n\r\n“Most willingly.”\r\n\r\n“You guard me, I remain; you are acting in the full discharge of your\r\nduty, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, then; remain as close to me as my shadow if you like; and I\r\ninfinitely prefer such a shadow to any one else.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan bowed to the compliment.\r\n\r\n“But, forget that you are Monsieur d’Artagnan, captain of the\r\nmusketeers; forget that I am Monsieur Fouquet, surintendant of the\r\nfinances; and let us talk about my affairs.”\r\n\r\n“That is rather a delicate subject.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but, for your sake, Monsieur Fouquet, I will do what may almost be\r\nregarded as an impossibility.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. What did the king say to you?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! is that the way you talk?”\r\n\r\n“The deuce!”\r\n\r\n“What do you think of my situation?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“However, unless you have some ill feeling against me--”\r\n\r\n“Your position is a difficult one.”\r\n\r\n“In what respect?”\r\n\r\n“Because you are under your own roof.”\r\n\r\n“However difficult it may be, I understand it very well.”\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose that, with any one else but yourself, I should have\r\nshown so much frankness?”\r\n\r\n“What! so much frankness, do you say? you, who refuse to tell me the\r\nslightest thing?”\r\n\r\n“At all events, then, so much ceremony and consideration.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I have nothing to say in that respect.”\r\n\r\n“One moment, monseigneur: let me tell you how I should have behaved\r\ntowards any one but yourself. It might be that I happened to arrive at\r\nyour door just as your guests or your friends had left you--or, if they\r\nhad not gone yet, I should wait until they were leaving, and should\r\nthen catch them one after the other, like rabbits; I should lock them up\r\nquietly enough, I should steal softly along the carpet of your corridor,\r\nand with one hand upon you, before you suspected the slightest thing\r\namiss, I should keep you safely until my master’s breakfast in the\r\nmorning. In this way, I should just the same have avoided all publicity,\r\nall disturbance, all opposition; but there would also have been no\r\nwarning for M. Fouquet, no consideration for his feelings, none of those\r\ndelicate concessions which are shown by persons who are essentially\r\ncourteous in their natures, whenever the decisive moment may arrive. Are\r\nyou satisfied with the plan?”\r\n\r\n“It makes me shudder.”\r\n\r\n“I thought you would not like it. It would have been very disagreeable\r\nto have made my appearance to-morrow, without any preparation, and to\r\nhave asked you to deliver up your sword.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! monsieur, I should have died of shame and anger.”\r\n\r\n“Your gratitude is too eloquently expressed. I have not done enough to\r\ndeserve it, I assure you.”\r\n\r\n“Most certainly, monsieur, you will never get me to believe that.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, monseigneur, if you are satisfied with what I have done,\r\nand have somewhat recovered from the shock which I prepared you for as\r\nmuch as I possibly could, let us allow the few hours that remain to pass\r\naway undisturbed. You are harassed, and should arrange your thoughts;\r\nI beg you, therefore, go to sleep, or pretend to go to sleep, either on\r\nyour bed, or in your bed; I will sleep in this armchair; and when I fall\r\nasleep, my rest is so sound that a cannon would not wake me.”\r\n\r\nFouquet smiled. “I expect, however,” continued the musketeer, “the case\r\nof a door being opened, whether a secret door, or any other; or the case\r\nof any one going out of, or coming into, the room--for anything like\r\nthat my ear is as quick and sensitive as the ear of a mouse. Creaking\r\nnoises make me start. It arises, I suppose, from a natural antipathy to\r\nanything of the kind. Move about as much as you like; walk up and down\r\nin any part of the room, write, efface, destroy, burn,--nothing like\r\nthat will prevent me from going to sleep or even prevent me from\r\nsnoring, but do not touch either the key or the handle of the door, for\r\nI should start up in a moment, and that would shake my nerves and make\r\nme ill.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said Fouquet, “you are certainly the most witty\r\nand the most courteous man I ever met with; and you will leave me only\r\none regret, that of having made your acquaintance so late.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan drew a deep sigh, which seemed to say, “Alas! you have\r\nperhaps made it too soon.” He then settled himself in his armchair,\r\nwhile Fouquet, half lying on his bed and leaning on his arm, was\r\nmeditating on his misadventures. In this way, both of them, leaving the\r\ncandles burning, awaited the first dawn of the day; and when Fouquet\r\nhappened to sigh too loudly, D’Artagnan only snored the louder. Not\r\na single visit, not even from Aramis, disturbed their quietude: not a\r\nsound even was heard throughout the whole vast palace. Outside, however,\r\nthe guards of honor on duty, and the patrol of musketeers, paced up and\r\ndown; and the sound of their feet could be heard on the gravel walks.\r\nIt seemed to act as an additional soporific for the sleepers, while the\r\nmurmuring of the wind through the trees, and the unceasing music of\r\nthe fountains whose waters tumbled in the basin, still went on\r\nuninterruptedly, without being disturbed at the slight noises and items\r\nof little moment that constitute the life and death of human nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XX. The Morning.\r\n\r\nIn vivid contrast to the sad and terrible destiny of the king imprisoned\r\nin the Bastile, and tearing, in sheer despair, the bolts and bars of\r\nhis dungeon, the rhetoric of the chroniclers of old would not fail to\r\npresent, as a complete antithesis, the picture of Philippe lying asleep\r\nbeneath the royal canopy. We do not pretend to say that such rhetoric is\r\nalways bad, and always scatters, in places where they have no right to\r\ngrow, the flowers with which it embellishes and enlivens history. But we\r\nshall, on the present occasion, carefully avoid polishing the antithesis\r\nin question, but shall proceed to draw another picture as minutely as\r\npossible, to serve as foil and counterfoil to the one in the preceding\r\nchapter. The young prince alighted from Aramis’s room, in the same way\r\nthe king had descended from the apartment dedicated to Morpheus.\r\nThe dome gradually and slowly sank down under Aramis’s pressure, and\r\nPhilippe stood beside the royal bed, which had ascended again after\r\nhaving deposited its prisoner in the secret depths of the subterranean\r\npassage. Alone, in the presence of all the luxury which surrounded him;\r\nalone, in the presence of his power; alone, with the part he was about\r\nto be forced to act, Philippe for the first time felt his heart, and\r\nmind, and soul expand beneath the influence of a thousand mutable\r\nemotions, which are the vital throbs of a king’s heart. He could not\r\nhelp changing color when he looked upon the empty bed, still tumbled\r\nby his brother’s body. This mute accomplice had returned, after having\r\ncompleted the work it had been destined to perform; it returned with the\r\ntraces of the crime; it spoke to the guilty author of that crime, with\r\nthe frank and unreserved language which an accomplice never fears to\r\nuse in the company of his companion in guilt; for it spoke the truth.\r\nPhilippe bent over the bed, and perceived a pocket-handkerchief lying on\r\nit, which was still damp from the cold sweat which had poured from Louis\r\nXIV.’s face. This sweat-bestained handkerchief terrified Philippe, as\r\nthe gore of Abel frightened Cain.\r\n\r\n“I am face to face with my destiny,” said Philippe, his eyes on fire,\r\nand his face a livid white. “Is it likely to be more terrifying than my\r\ncaptivity has been sad and gloomy? Though I am compelled to follow out,\r\nat every moment, the sovereign power and authority I have usurped, shall\r\nI cease to listen to the scruples of my heart? Yes! the king has lain\r\non this bed; it is indeed his head that has left its impression on this\r\npillow; his bitter tears that have stained this handkerchief: and yet,\r\nI hesitate to throw myself on the bed, or to press in my hand the\r\nhandkerchief which is embroidered with my brother’s arms. Away with such\r\nweakness; let me imitate M. d’Herblay, who asserts that a man’s action\r\nshould be always one degree above his thoughts; let me imitate M.\r\nd’Herblay, whose thoughts are of and for himself alone, who regards\r\nhimself as a man of honor, so long as he injures or betrays his enemies\r\nonly. I, I alone, should have occupied this bed, if Louis XIV. had not,\r\nowing to my mother’s criminal abandonment, stood in my way; and this\r\nhandkerchief, embroidered with the arms of France, would in right and\r\njustice belong to me alone, if, as M. d’Herblay observes, I had been\r\nleft my royal cradle. Philippe, son of France, take your place on that\r\nbed; Philippe, sole king of France, resume the blazonry that is yours!\r\nPhilippe, sole heir presumptive to Louis XIII., your father, show\r\nyourself without pity or mercy for the usurper who, at this moment, has\r\nnot even to suffer the agony of the remorse of all that you have had to\r\nsubmit to.”\r\n\r\nWith these words, Philippe, notwithstanding an instinctive repugnance of\r\nfeeling, and in spite of the shudder of terror which mastered his will,\r\nthrew himself on the royal bed, and forced his muscles to press the\r\nstill warm place where Louis XIV. had lain, while he buried his burning\r\nface in the handkerchief still moistened by his brother’s tears. With\r\nhis head thrown back and buried in the soft down of his pillow, Philippe\r\nperceived above him the crown of France, suspended, as we have stated,\r\nby angels with outspread golden wings.\r\n\r\nA man may be ambitious of lying in a lion’s den, but can hardly hope to\r\nsleep there quietly. Philippe listened attentively to every sound; his\r\nheart panted and throbbed at the very suspicion of approaching terror\r\nand misfortune; but confident in his own strength, which was confirmed\r\nby the force of an overpoweringly resolute determination, he waited\r\nuntil some decisive circumstance should permit him to judge for himself.\r\nHe hoped that imminent danger might be revealed to him, like those\r\nphosphoric lights of the tempest which show the sailors the altitude of\r\nthe waves against which they have to struggle. But nothing approached.\r\nSilence, that mortal enemy of restless hearts, and of ambitious minds,\r\nshrouded in the thickness of its gloom during the remainder of the night\r\nthe future king of France, who lay there sheltered beneath his stolen\r\ncrown. Towards the morning a shadow, rather than a body, glided into the\r\nroyal chamber; Philippe expected his approach and neither expressed nor\r\nexhibited any surprise.\r\n\r\n“Well, M. d’Herblay?”\r\n\r\n“Well, sire, all is accomplished.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Exactly as we expected.”\r\n\r\n“Did he resist?”\r\n\r\n“Terribly! tears and entreaties.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“A perfect stupor.”\r\n\r\n“But at last?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! at last, a complete victory, and absolute silence.”\r\n\r\n“Did the governor of the Bastile suspect anything?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“The resemblance, however--”\r\n\r\n“Was the cause of the success.”\r\n\r\n“But the prisoner cannot fail to explain himself. Think well of that. I\r\nhave myself been able to do as much as that, on former occasion.”\r\n\r\n“I have already provided for every chance. In a few days, sooner if\r\nnecessary, we will take the captive out of his prison, and will send him\r\nout of the country, to a place of exile so remote--”\r\n\r\n“People can return from their exile, Monsieur d’Herblay.”\r\n\r\n“To a place of exile so distant, I was going to say, that human strength\r\nand the duration of human life would not be enough for his return.”\r\n\r\nOnce more a cold look of intelligence passed between Aramis and the\r\nyoung king.\r\n\r\n“And M. du Vallon?” asked Philippe in order to change the conversation.\r\n\r\n“He will be presented to you to-day, and confidentially will\r\ncongratulate you on the danger which that conspirator has made you run.”\r\n\r\n“What is to be done with him?”\r\n\r\n“With M. du Vallon?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; confer a dukedom on him, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“A dukedom,” replied Aramis, smiling in a significant manner.\r\n\r\n“Why do you laugh, Monsieur d’Herblay?”\r\n\r\n“I laugh at the extreme caution of your idea.”\r\n\r\n“Cautious, why so?”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty is doubtless afraid that poor Porthos may possible become\r\na troublesome witness, and you wish to get rid of him.”\r\n\r\n“What! in making him a duke?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; you would assuredly kill him, for he would die from joy, and\r\nthe secret would die with him.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Aramis, phlegmatically; “I should lose a very good friend.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment, and in the middle of this idle conversation, under the\r\nlight tone of which the two conspirators concealed their joy and pride\r\nat their mutual success, Aramis heard something which made him prick up\r\nhis ears.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” said Philippe.\r\n\r\n“The dawn, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, before you retired to bed last night, you probably decided to do\r\nsomething this morning at break of day.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I told my captain of the musketeers,” replied the young man\r\nhurriedly, “that I should expect him.”\r\n\r\n“If you told him that, he will certainly be here, for he is a most\r\npunctual man.”\r\n\r\n“I hear a step in the vestibule.”\r\n\r\n“It must be he.”\r\n\r\n“Come, let us begin the attack,” said the young king resolutely.\r\n\r\n“Be cautious for Heaven’s sake. To begin the attack, and with\r\nD’Artagnan, would be madness. D’Artagnan knows nothing, he has seen\r\nnothing; he is a hundred miles from suspecting our mystery in the\r\nslightest degree, but if he comes into this room the first this morning,\r\nhe will be sure to detect something of what has taken place, and which\r\nhe would imagine it his business to occupy himself about. Before we\r\nallow D’Artagnan to penetrate into this room, we must air the room\r\nthoroughly, or introduce so many people into it, that the keenest scent\r\nin the whole kingdom may be deceived by the traces of twenty different\r\npersons.”\r\n\r\n“But how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?”\r\n observed the prince, impatient to measure swords with so redoubtable an\r\nantagonist.\r\n\r\n“I will take care of that,” replied the bishop, “and in order to begin,\r\nI am going to strike a blow which will completely stupefy our man.”\r\n\r\n“He, too, is striking a blow, for I hear him at the door,” added the\r\nprince, hurriedly.\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, a knock at the door was heard at that moment. Aramis was\r\nnot mistaken; for it was indeed D’Artagnan who adopted that mode of\r\nannouncing himself.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how he passed the night in philosophizing with M. Fouquet,\r\nbut the musketeer was very weary even of feigning to fall asleep, and\r\nas soon as earliest dawn illumined with its gloomy gleams of light the\r\nsumptuous cornices of the superintendent’s room, D’Artagnan rose from\r\nhis armchair, arranged his sword, brushed his coat and hat with his\r\nsleeve, like a private soldier getting ready for inspection.\r\n\r\n“Are you going out?” said Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur. And you?”\r\n\r\n“I shall remain.”\r\n\r\n“You pledge your word?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. Besides, my only reason for going out is to try and get that\r\nreply,--you know what I mean?”\r\n\r\n“That sentence, you mean--”\r\n\r\n“Stay, I have something of the old Roman in me. This morning, when I\r\ngot up, I remarked that my sword had got caught in one of the\r\n_aiguillettes_, and that my shoulder-belt had slipped quite off. That is\r\nan infallible sign.”\r\n\r\n“Of prosperity?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, be sure of it; for every time that that confounded belt of mine\r\nstuck fast to my back, it always signified a punishment from M. de\r\nTreville, or a refusal of money by M. de Mazarin. Every time my sword\r\nhung fast to my shoulder-belt, it always predicted some disagreeable\r\ncommission or another for me to execute, and I have had showers of\r\nthem all my life through. Every time, too, my sword danced about in its\r\nsheath, a duel, fortunate in its result, was sure to follow: whenever it\r\ndangled about the calves of my legs, it signified a slight wound; every\r\ntime it fell completely out of the scabbard, I was booked, and made up\r\nmy mind that I should have to remain on the field of battle, with two or\r\nthree months under surgical bandages into the bargain.”\r\n\r\n“I did not know your sword kept you so well informed,” said Fouquet,\r\nwith a faint smile, which showed how he was struggling against his\r\nown weakness. “Is your sword bewitched, or under the influence of some\r\nimperial charm?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you must know that my sword may almost be regarded as part of my\r\nown body. I have heard that certain men seem to have warnings given them\r\nby feeling something the matter with their legs, or a throbbing of their\r\ntemples. With me, it is my sword that warns me. Well, it told me of\r\nnothing this morning. But, stay a moment--look here, it has just fallen\r\nof its own accord into the last hole of the belt. Do you know what that\r\nis a warning of?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that tells me of an arrest that will have to be made this very\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the surintendant, more astonished than annoyed by this\r\nfrankness, “if there is nothing disagreeable predicted to you by your\r\nsword, I am to conclude that it is not disagreeable for you to arrest\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“You! arrest _you!_”\r\n\r\n“Of course. The warning--”\r\n\r\n“Does not concern you, since you have been arrested ever since\r\nyesterday. It is not you I shall have to arrest, be assured of that.\r\nThat is the reason why I am delighted, and also the reason why I said\r\nthat my day will be a happy one.”\r\n\r\nAnd with these words, pronounced with the most affectionate graciousness\r\nof manner, the captain took leave of Fouquet in order to wait upon the\r\nking. He was on the point of leaving the room, when Fouquet said to him,\r\n“One last mark of kindness.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, monseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“M. d’Herblay; let me see Monsieur d’Herblay.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to try and get him to come to you.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan did not think himself so good a prophet. It was written that\r\nthe day would pass away and realize all the predictions that had been\r\nmade in the morning. He had accordingly knocked, as we have seen, at the\r\nking’s door. The door opened. The captain thought that it was the king\r\nwho had just opened it himself; and this supposition was not altogether\r\ninadmissible, considering the state of agitation in which he had left\r\nLouis XIV. the previous evening; but instead of his royal master, whom\r\nhe was on the point of saluting with the greatest respect, he perceived\r\nthe long, calm features of Aramis. So extreme was his surprise that\r\nhe could hardly refrain from uttering a loud exclamation. “Aramis!” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, dear D’Artagnan,” replied the prelate, coldly.\r\n\r\n“You here!” stammered out the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“His majesty desires you to report that he is still sleeping, after\r\nhaving been greatly fatigued during the whole night.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said D’Artagnan, who could not understand how the bishop of\r\nVannes, who had been so indifferent a favorite the previous evening, had\r\nbecome in half a dozen hours the most magnificent mushroom of fortune\r\nthat had ever sprung up in a sovereign’s bedroom. In fact, to transmit\r\nthe orders of the king even to the mere threshold of that monarch’s\r\nroom, to serve as an intermediary of Louis XIV. so as to be able to\r\ngive a single order in his name at a couple paces from him, he must have\r\nbecome more than Richelieu had ever been to Louis XIII. D’Artagnan’s\r\nexpressive eye, half-opened lips, his curling mustache, said as much\r\nindeed in the plainest language to the chief favorite, who remained calm\r\nand perfectly unmoved.\r\n\r\n“Moreover,” continued the bishop, “you will be good enough, monsieur le\r\ncapitaine des mousquetaires, to allow those only to pass into the king’s\r\nroom this morning who have special permission. His majesty does not wish\r\nto be disturbed just yet.”\r\n\r\n“But,” objected D’Artagnan, almost on the point of refusing to obey this\r\norder, and particularly of giving unrestrained passage to the suspicions\r\nwhich the king’s silence had aroused--“but, monsieur l’eveque, his\r\nmajesty gave me a rendezvous for this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Later, later,” said the king’s voice, from the bottom of the alcove; a\r\nvoice which made a cold shudder pass through the musketeer’s veins. He\r\nbowed, amazed, confused, and stupefied by the smile with which Aramis\r\nseemed to overwhelm him, as soon as these words had been pronounced.\r\n\r\n“And then,” continued the bishop, “as an answer to what you were coming\r\nto ask the king, my dear D’Artagnan, here is an order of his majesty,\r\nwhich you will be good enough to attend to forthwith, for it concerns M.\r\nFouquet.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan took the order which was held out to him. “To be set at\r\nliberty!” he murmured. “Ah!” and he uttered a second “ah!” still more\r\nfull of intelligence than the former; for this order explained Aramis’s\r\npresence with the king, and that Aramis, in order to have obtained\r\nFouquet’s pardon, must have made considerable progress in the royal\r\nfavor, and that this favor explained, in its tenor, the hardly\r\nconceivable assurance with which M. d’Herblay issued the order in the\r\nking’s name. For D’Artagnan it was quite sufficient to have understood\r\nsomething of the matter in hand to order to understand the rest. He\r\nbowed and withdrew a couple of paces, as though he were about to leave.\r\n\r\n“I am going with you,” said the bishop.\r\n\r\n“Where to?”\r\n\r\n“To M. Fouquet; I wish to be a witness of his delight.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Aramis, how you puzzled me just now!” said D’Artagnan again.\r\n\r\n“But you understand _now_, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Of course I understand,” he said aloud; but added in a low tone to\r\nhimself, almost hissing the words between his teeth, “No, no, I do not\r\nunderstand yet. But it is all the same, for here is the order for it.”\r\n And then he added, “I will lead the way, monseigneur,” and he conducted\r\nAramis to Fouquet’s apartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXI. The King’s Friend.\r\n\r\nFouquet was waiting with anxiety; he had already sent away many of his\r\nservants and friends, who, anticipating the usual hour of his ordinary\r\nreceptions, had called at his door to inquire after him. Preserving\r\nthe utmost silence respecting the danger which hung suspended by a hair\r\nabove his head, he only asked them, as he did every one, indeed, who\r\ncame to the door, where Aramis was. When he saw D’Artagnan return,\r\nand when he perceived the bishop of Vannes behind him, he could hardly\r\nrestrain his delight; it was fully equal to his previous uneasiness. The\r\nmere sight of Aramis was a complete compensation to the surintendant for\r\nthe unhappiness he had undergone in his arrest. The prelate was silent\r\nand grave; D’Artagnan completely bewildered by such an accumulation of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n“Well, captain, so you have brought M. d’Herblay to me.”\r\n\r\n“And something better still, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Liberty.”\r\n\r\n“I am free!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; by the king’s order.”\r\n\r\nFouquet resumed his usual serenity, that he might interrogate Aramis\r\nwith a look.\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, you can thank M. l’eveque de Vannes,” pursued D’Artagnan, “for\r\nit is indeed to him that you owe the change that has taken place in the\r\nking.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Fouquet, more humiliated at the service than grateful at its\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n“But you,” continued D’Artagnan, addressing Aramis--“you, who have\r\nbecome M. Fouquet’s protector and patron, can you not do something for\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Anything in the wide world you like, my friend,” replied the bishop, in\r\nhis calmest tones.\r\n\r\n“One thing only, then, and I shall be perfectly satisfied. How on earth\r\ndid you manage to become the favorite of the king, you who have never\r\nspoken to him more than twice in your life?”\r\n\r\n“From a friend such as you are,” said Aramis, “I cannot conceal\r\nanything.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! very good, tell me, then.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. You think that I have seen the king only twice, whilst the\r\nfact is I have seen him more than a hundred times; only we have kept it\r\nvery secret, that is all.” And without trying to remove the color which\r\nat this revelation made D’Artagnan’s face flush scarlet, Aramis\r\nturned towards M. Fouquet, who was as much surprised as the musketeer.\r\n“Monseigneur,” he resumed, “the king desires me to inform you that he\r\nis more than ever your friend, and that your beautiful _fete_, so\r\ngenerously offered by you on his behalf, has touched him to the very\r\nheart.”\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon he saluted M. Fouquet with so much reverence of manner,\r\nthat the latter, incapable of understanding a man whose diplomacy was\r\nof so prodigious a character, remained incapable of uttering a single\r\nsyllable, and equally incapable of thought or movement. D’Artagnan\r\nfancied he perceived that these two men had something to say to\r\neach other, and he was about to yield to that feeling of instinctive\r\npoliteness which in such a case hurries a man towards the door, when\r\nhe feels his presence is an inconvenience for others; but his eager\r\ncuriosity, spurred on by so many mysteries, counseled him to remain.\r\n\r\nAramis thereupon turned towards him, and said, in a quiet tone, “You\r\nwill not forget, my friend, the king’s order respecting those whom\r\nhe intends to receive this morning on rising.” These words were clear\r\nenough, and the musketeer understood them; he therefore bowed to\r\nFouquet, and then to Aramis,--to the latter with a slight admixture of\r\nironical respect,--and disappeared.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he left, than Fouquet, whose impatience had hardly been\r\nable to wait for that moment, darted towards the door to close it, and\r\nthen returning to the bishop, he said, “My dear D’Herblay, I think it\r\nnow high time you should explain all that has passed, for, in plain and\r\nhonest truth, I do not understand anything.”\r\n\r\n“We will explain all that to you,” said Aramis, sitting down, and making\r\nFouquet sit down also. “Where shall I begin?”\r\n\r\n“With this first of all. Why does the king set me at liberty?”\r\n\r\n“You ought rather to ask me what his reason was for having you\r\narrested.”\r\n\r\n“Since my arrest, I have had time to think over it, and my idea is\r\nthat it arises out of some slight feeling of jealousy. My _fete_ put M.\r\nColbert out of temper, and M. Colbert discovered some cause of complaint\r\nagainst me; Belle-Isle, for instance.”\r\n\r\n“No; there is no question at all just now of Belle-Isle.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, then?”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember those receipts for thirteen millions which M. de\r\nMazarin contrived to steal from you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course!”\r\n\r\n“Well, you are pronounced a public robber.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! that is not all. Do you also remember that letter you wrote to La\r\nVallière?”\r\n\r\n“Alas! yes.”\r\n\r\n“And that proclaims you a traitor and a suborner.”\r\n\r\n“Why should he have pardoned me, then?”\r\n\r\n“We have not yet arrived at that part of our argument. I wish you to be\r\nquite convinced of the fact itself. Observe this well: the king knows\r\nyou to be guilty of an appropriation of public funds. Oh! of course _I_\r\nknow that you have done nothing of the kind; but, at all events, the\r\nking has seen the receipts, and he can do no other than believe you are\r\nincriminated.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, I do not see--”\r\n\r\n“You will see presently, though. The king, moreover, having read your\r\nlove-letter to La Vallière, and the offers you there made her, cannot\r\nretain any doubt of your intentions with regard to that young lady; you\r\nwill admit that, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. Pray conclude.”\r\n\r\n“In the fewest words. The king, we may henceforth assume, is your\r\npowerful, implacable, and eternal enemy.”\r\n\r\n“Agreed. But am I, then, so powerful, that he has not dared to sacrifice\r\nme, notwithstanding his hatred, with all the means which my weakness, or\r\nmy misfortunes, may have given him as a hold upon me?”\r\n\r\n“It is clear, beyond all doubt,” pursued Aramis, coldly, “that the king\r\nhas quarreled with you--irreconcilably.”\r\n\r\n“But, since he has absolved me--”\r\n\r\n“Do you believe it likely?” asked the bishop, with a searching look.\r\n\r\n“Without believing in his sincerity, I believe it in the accomplished\r\nfact.”\r\n\r\nAramis slightly shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“But why, then, should Louis XIV. have commissioned you to tell me what\r\nyou have just stated?”\r\n\r\n“The king charged me with no message for you.”\r\n\r\n“With nothing!” said the superintendent, stupefied. “But, that order--”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes. You are quite right. There _is_ an order, certainly;” and\r\nthese words were pronounced by Aramis in so strange a tone, that Fouquet\r\ncould not resist starting.\r\n\r\n“You are concealing something from me, I see. What is it?”\r\n\r\nAramis softly rubbed his white fingers over his chin, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Does the king exile me?”\r\n\r\n“Do not act as if you were playing at the game children play at when\r\nthey have to try and guess where a thing has been hidden, and are\r\ninformed, by a bell being rung, when they are approaching near to it, or\r\ngoing away from it.”\r\n\r\n“Speak, then.”\r\n\r\n“Guess.”\r\n\r\n“You alarm me.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! that is because you have not guessed, then.”\r\n\r\n“What did the king say to you? In the name of our friendship, do not\r\ndeceive me.”\r\n\r\n“The king has not said one word to me.”\r\n\r\n“You are killing me with impatience, D’Herblay. Am I still\r\nsuperintendent?”\r\n\r\n“As long as you like.”\r\n\r\n“But what extraordinary empire have you so suddenly acquired over his\r\nmajesty’s mind?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that’s the point.”\r\n\r\n“He does your bidding?”\r\n\r\n“I believe so.”\r\n\r\n“It is hardly credible.”\r\n\r\n“So any one would say.”\r\n\r\n“D’Herblay, by our alliance, by our friendship, by everything you hold\r\ndearest in the world, speak openly, I implore you. By what means have\r\nyou succeeded in overcoming Louis XIV.’s prejudices, for he did not like\r\nyou, I am certain.”\r\n\r\n“The king will like me _now_,” said Aramis, laying stress upon the last\r\nword.\r\n\r\n“You have something particular, then, between you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“A secret, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“A secret.”\r\n\r\n“A secret of such a nature as to change his majesty’s interests?”\r\n\r\n“You are, indeed, a man of superior intelligence, monseigneur, and\r\nhave made a particularly accurate guess. I have, in fact, discovered a\r\nsecret, of a nature to change the interests of the king of France.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Fouquet, with the reserve of a man who does not wish to ask\r\nany more questions.\r\n\r\n“And you shall judge of it yourself,” pursued Aramis; “and you shall\r\ntell me if I am mistaken with regard to the importance of this secret.”\r\n\r\n“I am listening, since you are good enough to unbosom yourself to me;\r\nonly do not forget that I have asked you about nothing which it may be\r\nindiscreet in you to communicate.”\r\n\r\nAramis seemed, for a moment, as if he were collecting himself.\r\n\r\n“Do not speak!” said Fouquet: “there is still time enough.”\r\n\r\n“Do you remember,” said the bishop, casting down his eyes, “the birth of\r\nLouis XIV.?”\r\n\r\n“As if it were yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Have you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing; except that the king was not really the son of Louis XIII.”\r\n\r\n“That does not matter to us, or the kingdom either; he is the son of his\r\nfather, says the French law, whose father is recognized by law.”\r\n\r\n“True; but it is a grave matter, when the quality of races is called\r\ninto question.”\r\n\r\n“A merely secondary question, after all. So that, in fact, you have\r\nnever learned or heard anything in particular?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“That is where my secret begins. The queen, you must know, instead of\r\nbeing delivered of a son, was delivered of twins.”\r\n\r\nFouquet looked up suddenly as he replied:\r\n\r\n“And the second is dead?”\r\n\r\n“You will see. These twins seemed likely to be regarded as the pride of\r\ntheir mother, and the hope of France; but the weak nature of the king,\r\nhis superstitious feelings, made him apprehend a series of conflicts\r\nbetween two children whose rights were equal; so he put out of the\r\nway--he suppressed--one of the twins.”\r\n\r\n“Suppressed, do you say?”\r\n\r\n“Have patience. Both the children grew up; the one on the throne, whose\r\nminister you are--the other, who is my friend, in gloom and isolation.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! What are you saying, Monsieur d’Herblay? And what is this\r\npoor prince doing?”\r\n\r\n“Ask me, rather, what has he done.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes.”\r\n\r\n“He was brought up in the country, and then thrown into a fortress which\r\ngoes by the name of the Bastile.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?” cried the surintendant, clasping his hands.\r\n\r\n“The one was the most fortunate of men: the other the most unhappy and\r\nmiserable of all living beings.”\r\n\r\n“Does his mother not know this?”\r\n\r\n“Anne of Austria knows it all.”\r\n\r\n“And the king?”\r\n\r\n“Knows absolutely nothing.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better,” said Fouquet.\r\n\r\nThis remark seemed to make a great impression on Aramis; he looked at\r\nFouquet with the most anxious expression of countenance.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon; I interrupted you,” said Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“I was saying,” resumed Aramis, “that this poor prince was the\r\nunhappiest of human beings, when Heaven, whose thoughts are over all His\r\ncreatures, undertook to come to his assistance.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! in what way? Tell me.”\r\n\r\n“You will see. The reigning king--I say the reigning king--you can guess\r\nvery well why?”\r\n\r\n“No. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because _both_ of them, being legitimate princes, ought to have been\r\nkings. Is not that your opinion?”\r\n\r\n“It is, certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Unreservedly?”\r\n\r\n“Most unreservedly; twins are one person in two bodies.”\r\n\r\n“I am pleased that a legist of your learning and authority should\r\nhave pronounced such an opinion. It is agreed, then, that each of them\r\npossessed equal rights, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Incontestably! but, gracious heavens, what an extraordinary\r\ncircumstance!”\r\n\r\n“We are not at the end of it yet.--Patience.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I shall find ‘patience’ enough.”\r\n\r\n“Heaven wished to raise up for that oppressed child an avenger, or\r\na supporter, or vindicator, if you prefer it. It happened that the\r\nreigning king, the usurper--you are quite of my opinion, I believe, that\r\nit is an act of usurpation quietly to enjoy, and selfishly to assume the\r\nright over, an inheritance to which a man has only half a right?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, usurpation is the word.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, I continue. It was Heaven’s will that the usurper should\r\npossess, in the person of his first minister, a man of great talent, of\r\nlarge and generous nature.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” said Fouquet, “I understand you; you have relied upon me\r\nto repair the wrong which has been done to this unhappy brother of Louis\r\nXIV. You have thought well; I will help you. I thank you, D’Herblay, I\r\nthank you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, it is not that at all; you have not allowed me to finish,” said\r\nAramis, perfectly unmoved.\r\n\r\n“I will not say another word, then.”\r\n\r\n“M. Fouquet, I was observing, the minister of the reigning sovereign,\r\nwas suddenly taken into the greatest aversion, and menaced with the\r\nruin of his fortune, loss of liberty, loss of life even, by intrigue and\r\npersonal hatred, to which the king gave too readily an attentive ear.\r\nBut Heaven permits (still, however, out of consideration for the unhappy\r\nprince who had been sacrificed) that M. Fouquet should in his turn have\r\na devoted friend who knew this state secret, and felt that he possessed\r\nstrength and courage enough to divulge this secret, after having had the\r\nstrength to carry it locked up in his own heart for twenty years.\r\n\r\n“Go no farther,” said Fouquet, full of generous feelings. “I understand\r\nyou, and can guess everything now. You went to see the king when the\r\nintelligence of my arrest reached you; you implored him, he refused to\r\nlisten to you; then you threatened him with that secret, threatened to\r\nreveal it, and Louis XIV., alarmed at the risk of its betrayal, granted\r\nto the terror of your indiscretion what he refused to your generous\r\nintercession. I understand, I understand; you have the king in your\r\npower; I understand.”\r\n\r\n“You understand _nothing_--as yet,” replied Aramis, “and again you\r\ninterrupt me. Then, too, allow me to observe that you pay no attention\r\nto logical reasoning, and seem to forget what you ought most to\r\nremember.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“You know upon what I laid the greatest stress at the beginning of our\r\nconversation?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, his majesty’s hate, invincible hate for me; yes, but what feeling\r\nof hate could resist the threat of such a revelation?”\r\n\r\n“Such a revelation, do you say? that is the very point where your logic\r\nfails you. What! do you suppose that if I had made such a revelation to\r\nthe king, I should have been alive now?”\r\n\r\n“It is not ten minutes ago that you were with the king.”\r\n\r\n“That may be. He might not have had the time to get me killed outright,\r\nbut he would have had the time to get me gagged and thrown in a dungeon.\r\nCome, come, show a little consistency in your reasoning, _mordieu!_”\r\n\r\nAnd by the mere use of this word, which was so thoroughly his old\r\nmusketeer’s expression, forgotten by one who never seemed to forget\r\nanything, Fouquet could not but understand to what a pitch of exaltation\r\nthe calm, impenetrable bishop of Vannes had wrought himself. He\r\nshuddered.\r\n\r\n“And then,” replied the latter, after having mastered his feelings,\r\n“should I be the man I really am, should I be the true friend you\r\nbelieve me, if I were to expose you, whom the king already hates so\r\nbitterly, to a feeling more than ever to be dreaded in that young man?\r\nTo have robbed him, is nothing; to have addressed the woman he loves, is\r\nnot much; but to hold in your keeping both his crown and his honor, why,\r\nhe would pluck out your heart with his own hands.”\r\n\r\n“You have not allowed him to penetrate your secret, then?”\r\n\r\n“I would sooner, far sooner, have swallowed at one draught all the\r\npoisons that Mithridates drank in twenty years, in order to try and\r\navoid death, than have betrayed my secret to the king.”\r\n\r\n“What have you done, then?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! now we are coming to the point, monseigneur. I think I shall not\r\nfail to excite in you a little interest. You are listening, I hope.”\r\n\r\n“How can you ask me if I am listening? Go on.”\r\n\r\nAramis walked softly all round the room, satisfied himself that they\r\nwere alone, and that all was silent, and then returned and placed\r\nhimself close to the armchair in which Fouquet was seated, awaiting with\r\nthe deepest anxiety the revelation he had to make.\r\n\r\n“I forgot to tell you,” resumed Aramis, addressing himself to Fouquet,\r\nwho listened to him with the most absorbed attention--“I forgot to\r\nmention a most remarkable circumstance respecting these twins, namely,\r\nthat God had formed them so startlingly, so miraculously, like each\r\nother, that it would be utterly impossible to distinguish the one from\r\nthe other. Their own mother would not be able to distinguish them.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?” exclaimed Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“The same noble character in their features, the same carriage, the same\r\nstature, the same voice.”\r\n\r\n“But their thoughts? degree of intelligence? their knowledge of human\r\nlife?”\r\n\r\n“There is inequality there, I admit, monseigneur. Yes; for the prisoner\r\nof the Bastile is, most incontestably, superior in every way to his\r\nbrother; and if, from his prison, this unhappy victim were to pass to\r\nthe throne, France would not, from the earliest period of its history,\r\nperhaps, have had a master more powerful in genius and nobility of\r\ncharacter.”\r\n\r\nFouquet buried his face in his hands, as if he were overwhelmed by the\r\nweight of this immense secret. Aramis approached him.\r\n\r\n“There is a further inequality,” he said, continuing his work of\r\ntemptation, “an inequality which concerns yourself, monseigneur, between\r\nthe twins, both sons of Louis XIII., namely, the last comer does not\r\nknow M. Colbert.”\r\n\r\nFouquet raised his head immediately--his features were pale and\r\ndistorted. The bolt had hit its mark--not his heart, but his mind and\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\n“I understand you,” he said to Aramis; “you are proposing a conspiracy\r\nto me?”\r\n\r\n“Something like it.”\r\n\r\n“One of those attempts which, as you said at the beginning of this\r\nconversation, alters the fate of empires?”\r\n\r\n“And of superintendents, too; yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“In a word, you propose that I should agree to the substitution of the\r\nson of Louis XIII., who is now a prisoner in the Bastile, for the son of\r\nLouis XIII., who is at this moment asleep in the Chamber of Morpheus?”\r\n\r\nAramis smiled with the sinister expression of the sinister thought which\r\nwas passing through his brain. “Exactly,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Have you thought,” continued Fouquet, becoming animated with that\r\nstrength of talent which in a few seconds originates, and matures the\r\nconception of a plan, and with that largeness of view which foresees all\r\nconsequences, and embraces every result at a glance--“have you thought\r\nthat we must assemble the nobility, the clergy, and the third estate\r\nof the realm; that we shall have to depose the reigning sovereign, to\r\ndisturb by so frightful a scandal the tomb of their dead father, to\r\nsacrifice the life, the honor of a woman, Anne of Austria, the life and\r\npeace of mind and heart of another woman, Maria Theresa; and suppose\r\nthat it were all done, if we were to succeed in doing it--”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you,” continued Aramis, coldly. “There is not a\r\nsingle syllable of sense in all you have just said.”\r\n\r\n“What!” said the superintendent, surprised, “a man like you refuse to\r\nview the practical bearing of the case! Do you confine yourself to the\r\nchildish delight of a political illusion, and neglect the chances of its\r\nbeing carried into execution; in other words, the reality itself, is it\r\npossible?”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said Aramis, emphasizing the word with a kind of disdainful\r\nfamiliarity, “what does Heaven do in order to substitute one king for\r\nanother?”\r\n\r\n“Heaven!” exclaimed Fouquet--“Heaven gives directions to its agent,\r\nwho seizes upon the doomed victim, hurries him away, and seats the\r\ntriumphant rival on the empty throne. But you forget that this agent is\r\ncalled death. Oh! Monsieur d’Herblay, in Heaven’s name, tell me if you\r\nhave had the idea--”\r\n\r\n“There is no question of that, monseigneur; you are going beyond the\r\nobject in view. Who spoke of Louis XIV.’s death? who spoke of adopting\r\nthe example which Heaven sets in following out the strict execution\r\nof its decrees? No, I wish you to understand that Heaven effects its\r\npurposes without confusion or disturbance, without exciting comment\r\nor remark, without difficulty or exertion; and that men, inspired by\r\nHeaven, succeed like Heaven itself, in all their undertakings, in all\r\nthey attempt, in all they do.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I mean, my _friend_,” returned Aramis, with the same intonation on the\r\nword friend that he had applied to it the first time--“I mean that\r\nif there has been any confusion, scandal, and even effort in the\r\nsubstitution of the prisoner for the king, I defy you to prove it.”\r\n\r\n“What!” cried Fouquet, whiter than the handkerchief with which he wiped\r\nhis temples, “what do you say?”\r\n\r\n“Go to the king’s apartment,” continued Aramis, tranquilly, “and you who\r\nknow the mystery, I defy even you to perceive that the prisoner of the\r\nBastile is lying in his brother’s bed.”\r\n\r\n“But the king,” stammered Fouquet, seized with horror at the\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n“What king?” said Aramis, in his gentlest tone; “the one who hates you,\r\nor the one who likes you?”\r\n\r\n“The king--of--_yesterday_.”\r\n\r\n“The king of yesterday! be quite easy on that score; he has gone to take\r\nthe place in the Bastile which his victim occupied for so many years.”\r\n\r\n“Great God! And who took him there?”\r\n\r\n“I.”\r\n\r\n“You?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and in the simplest way. I carried him away last night. While he\r\nwas descending into midnight, the other was ascending into day. I do\r\nnot think there has been any disturbance whatever. A flash of lightning\r\nwithout thunder awakens nobody.”\r\n\r\nFouquet uttered a thick, smothered cry, as if he had been struck by some\r\ninvisible blow, and clasping his head between his clenched hands, he\r\nmurmured: “You did that?”\r\n\r\n“Cleverly enough, too; what do you think of it?”\r\n\r\n“You dethroned the king? imprisoned him, too?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that has been done.”\r\n\r\n“And such an action was committed _here_, at Vaux?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, here, at Vaux, in the Chamber of Morpheus. It would almost seem\r\nthat it had been built in anticipation of such an act.”\r\n\r\n“And at what time did it occur?”\r\n\r\n“Last night, between twelve and one o’clock.”\r\n\r\nFouquet made a movement as if he were on the point of springing upon\r\nAramis; he restrained himself. “At Vaux; under my roof!” he said, in a\r\nhalf-strangled voice.\r\n\r\n“I believe so! for it is still your house, and it is likely to continue\r\nso, since M. Colbert cannot rob you of it now.”\r\n\r\n“It was under my roof, then, monsieur, that you committed this crime?”\r\n\r\n“This crime?” said Aramis, stupefied.\r\n\r\n“This abominable crime!” pursued Fouquet, becoming more and more\r\nexcited; “this crime more execrable than an assassination! this crime\r\nwhich dishonors my name forever, and entails upon me the horror of\r\nposterity.”\r\n\r\n“You are not in your senses, monsieur,” replied Aramis, in an irresolute\r\ntone of voice; “you are speaking too loudly; take care!”\r\n\r\n“I will call out so loudly, that the whole world shall hear me.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Fouquet, take care!”\r\n\r\nFouquet turned round towards the prelate, whom he looked at full in the\r\nface. “You have dishonored me,” he said, “in committing so foul an\r\nact of treason, so heinous a crime upon my guest, upon one who was\r\npeacefully reposing beneath my roof. Oh! woe, woe is me!”\r\n\r\n“Woe to the man, rather, who beneath your roof meditated the ruin of\r\nyour fortune, your life. Do you forget that?”\r\n\r\n“He was my guest, my sovereign.”\r\n\r\nAramis rose, his eyes literally bloodshot, his mouth trembling\r\nconvulsively. “Have I a man out of his senses to deal with?” he said.\r\n\r\n“You have an honorable man to deal with.”\r\n\r\n“You are mad.”\r\n\r\n“A man who will prevent you consummating your crime.”\r\n\r\n“You are mad, I say.”\r\n\r\n“A man who would sooner, oh! far sooner, die; who would kill you even,\r\nrather than allow you to complete his dishonor.”\r\n\r\nAnd Fouquet snatched up his sword, which D’Artagnan had placed at the\r\nhead of his bed, and clenched it resolutely in his hand. Aramis frowned,\r\nand thrust his hand into his breast as if in search of a weapon. This\r\nmovement did not escape Fouquet, who, full of nobleness and pride in\r\nhis magnanimity, threw his sword to a distance from him, and approached\r\nAramis so close as to touch his shoulder with his disarmed hand.\r\n“Monsieur,” he said, “I would sooner die here on the spot than survive\r\nthis terrible disgrace; and if you have any pity left for me, I entreat\r\nyou to take my life.”\r\n\r\nAramis remained silent and motionless.\r\n\r\n“You do not reply?” said Fouquet.\r\n\r\nAramis raised his head gently, and a glimmer of hope might be seen\r\nonce more to animate his eyes. “Reflect, monseigneur,” he said, “upon\r\neverything we have to expect. As the matter now stands, the king is\r\nstill alive, and his imprisonment saves your life.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Fouquet, “you may have been acting on my behalf, but I\r\nwill not, do not, accept your services. But, first of all, I do not wish\r\nyour ruin. You will leave this house.”\r\n\r\nAramis stifled the exclamation which almost escaped his broken heart.\r\n\r\n“I am hospitable towards all who are dwellers beneath my roof,”\r\n continued Fouquet, with an air of inexpressible majesty; “you will not\r\nbe more fatally lost than he whose ruin you have consummated.”\r\n\r\n“You will be so,” said Aramis, in a hoarse, prophetic voice, “you will\r\nbe so, believe me.”\r\n\r\n“I accept the augury, Monsieur d’Herblay; but nothing shall prevent me,\r\nnothing shall stop me. You will leave Vaux--you must leave France; I\r\ngive you four hours to place yourself out of the king’s reach.”\r\n\r\n“Four hours?” said Aramis, scornfully and incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Upon the word of Fouquet, no one shall follow you before the expiration\r\nof that time. You will therefore have four hours’ advance of those whom\r\nthe king may wish to dispatch after you.”\r\n\r\n“Four hours!” repeated Aramis, in a thick, smothered voice.\r\n\r\n“It is more than you will need to get on board a vessel and flee to\r\nBelle-Isle, which I give you as a place of refuge.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” murmured Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Belle-Isle is as much mine for you, as Vaux is mine for the king.\r\nGo, D’Herblay, go! as long as I live, not a hair of your head shall be\r\ninjured.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Aramis, with a cold irony of manner.\r\n\r\n“Go at once, then, and give me your hand, before we both hasten away;\r\nyou to save your life, I to save my honor.”\r\n\r\nAramis withdrew from his breast the hand he had concealed there; it was\r\nstained with his blood. He had dug his nails into his flesh, as if in\r\npunishment for having nursed so many projects, more vain, insensate, and\r\nfleeting than the life of the man himself. Fouquet was horror-stricken,\r\nand then his heart smote him with pity. He threw open his arms as if to\r\nembrace him.\r\n\r\n“I had no arms,” murmured Aramis, as wild and terrible in his wrath as\r\nthe shade of Dido. And then, without touching Fouquet’s hand, he turned\r\nhis head aside, and stepped back a pace or two. His last word was an\r\nimprecation, his last gesture a curse, which his blood-stained hand\r\nseemed to invoke, as it sprinkled on Fouquet’s face a few drops of blood\r\nwhich flowed from his breast. And both of them darted out of the room\r\nby the secret staircase which led down to the inner courtyard. Fouquet\r\nordered his best horses, while Aramis paused at the foot of the\r\nstaircase which led to Porthos’s apartment. He reflected profoundly\r\nand for some time, while Fouquet’s carriage left the courtyard at full\r\ngallop.\r\n\r\n“Shall I go alone?” said Aramis to himself, “or warn the prince? Oh!\r\nfury! Warn the prince, and then--do what? Take him with me? To carry\r\nthis accusing witness about with me everywhere? War, too, would\r\nfollow--civil war, implacable in its nature! And without any resource\r\nsave myself--it is impossible! What could he do without me? Oh!\r\nwithout me he will be utterly destroyed. Yet who knows--let destiny\r\nbe fulfilled--condemned he was, let him remain so then! Good or evil\r\nSpirit--gloomy and scornful Power, whom men call the genius of humanity,\r\nthou art a power more restlessly uncertain, more baselessly useless,\r\nthan wild mountain wind! Chance, thou term’st thyself, but thou art\r\nnothing; thou inflamest everything with thy breath, crumblest mountains\r\nat thy approach, and suddenly art thyself destroyed at the presence of\r\nthe Cross of dead wood behind which stand another Power invisible like\r\nthyself--whom thou deniest, perhaps, but whose avenging hand is on thee,\r\nand hurls thee in the dust dishonored and unnamed! Lost!--I am lost!\r\nWhat can be done? Flee to Belle-Isle? Yes, and leave Porthos behind me,\r\nto talk and relate the whole affair to every one! Porthos, too, who will\r\nhave to suffer for what he has done. I will not let poor Porthos suffer.\r\nHe seems like one of the members of my own frame; and his grief or\r\nmisfortune would be mine as well. Porthos shall leave with me, and shall\r\nfollow my destiny. It must be so.”\r\n\r\nAnd Aramis, apprehensive of meeting any one to whom his hurried\r\nmovements might appear suspicious, ascended the staircase without being\r\nperceived. Porthos, so recently returned from Paris, was already in a\r\nprofound sleep; his huge body forgot its fatigue, as his mind forgot\r\nits thoughts. Aramis entered, light as a shadow, and placed his nervous\r\ngrasp on the giant’s shoulder. “Come, Porthos,” he cried, “come.”\r\n\r\nPorthos obeyed, rose from his bed, opened his eyes, even before his\r\nintelligence seemed to be aroused.\r\n\r\n“We leave immediately,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” returned Porthos.\r\n\r\n“We shall go mounted, and faster than we have ever gone in our lives.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” repeated Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Dress yourself, my friend.”\r\n\r\nAnd he helped the giant to dress himself, and thrust his gold and\r\ndiamonds into his pocket. Whilst he was thus engaged, a slight noise\r\nattracted his attention, and on looking up, he saw D’Artagnan watching\r\nthem through the half-opened door. Aramis started.\r\n\r\n“What the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner?” said\r\nthe musketeer.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“We are going off on a mission of great importance,” added the bishop.\r\n\r\n“You are very fortunate,” said the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“Oh, dear me!” said Porthos, “I feel so wearied; I would far sooner have\r\nbeen fast asleep. But the service of the king....”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen M. Fouquet?” said Aramis to D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Yes, this very minute, in a carriage.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say to you?”\r\n\r\n“‘Adieu;’ nothing more.”\r\n\r\n“Was that all?”\r\n\r\n“What else do you think he could say? Am I worth anything now, since you\r\nhave got into such high favor?”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said Aramis, embracing the musketeer; “your good times are\r\nreturning again. You will have no occasion to be jealous of any one.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! bah!”\r\n\r\n“I predict that something will happen to you to-day which will increase\r\nyour importance more than ever.”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“You know that I know all the news?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!”\r\n\r\n“Come, Porthos, are you ready? Let us go.”\r\n\r\n“I am quite ready, Aramis.”\r\n\r\n“Let us embrace D’Artagnan first.”\r\n\r\n“Most certainly.”\r\n\r\n“But the horses?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! there is no want of them here. Will you have mine?”\r\n\r\n“No; Porthos has his own stud. So adieu! adieu!”\r\n\r\nThe fugitives mounted their horses beneath the very eyes of the captain\r\nof the musketeers, who held Porthos’s stirrup for him, and gazed after\r\nthem until they were out of sight.\r\n\r\n“On any other occasion,” thought the Gascon, “I should say that those\r\ngentlemen were making their escape; but in these days politics seem\r\nso changed that such an exit is termed going on a mission. I have no\r\nobjection; let me attend to my own affairs, that is more than enough for\r\n_me_,”--and he philosophically entered his apartments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXII. Showing How the Countersign Was Respected at the Bastile.\r\n\r\nFouquet tore along as fast as his horses could drag him. On his way he\r\ntrembled with horror at the idea of what had just been revealed to him.\r\n\r\n“What must have been,” he thought, “the youth of those extraordinary\r\nmen, who, even as age is stealing fast upon them, are still able to\r\nconceive such gigantic plans, and carry them through without a tremor?”\r\n\r\nAt one moment he could not resist the idea that all Aramis had just been\r\nrecounting to him was nothing more than a dream, and whether the fable\r\nitself was not the snare; so that when Fouquet arrived at the Bastile,\r\nhe might possibly find an order of arrest, which would send him to join\r\nthe dethroned king. Strongly impressed with this idea, he gave certain\r\nsealed orders on his route, while fresh horses were being harnessed\r\nto his carriage. These orders were addressed to M. d’Artagnan and to\r\ncertain others whose fidelity to the king was far above suspicion.\r\n\r\n“In this way,” said Fouquet to himself, “prisoner or not, I shall have\r\nperformed the duty that I owe my honor. The orders will not reach them\r\nuntil after my return, if I should return free, and consequently they\r\nwill not have been unsealed. I shall take them back again. If I am\r\ndelayed; it will be because some misfortune will have befallen me; and\r\nin that case assistance will be sent for me as well as for the king.”\r\n\r\nPrepared in this manner, the superintendent arrived at the Bastile;\r\nhe had traveled at the rate of five leagues and a half the hour. Every\r\ncircumstance of delay which Aramis had escaped in his visit to the\r\nBastile befell Fouquet. It was useless giving his name, equally useless\r\nhis being recognized; he could not succeed in obtaining an entrance.\r\nBy dint of entreaties, threats, commands, he succeeded in inducing a\r\nsentinel to speak to one of the subalterns, who went and told the major.\r\nAs for the governor they did not even dare disturb him. Fouquet sat in\r\nhis carriage, at the outer gate of the fortress, chafing with rage and\r\nimpatience, awaiting the return of the officers, who at last re-appeared\r\nwith a sufficiently sulky air.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Fouquet, impatiently, “what did the major say?”\r\n\r\n“Well, monsieur,” replied the soldier, “the major laughed in my face. He\r\ntold me that M. Fouquet was at Vaux, and that even were he at Paris, M.\r\nFouquet would not get up at so early an hour as the present.”\r\n\r\n“_Mordieu!_ you are an absolute set of fools,” cried the minister,\r\ndarting out of the carriage; and before the subaltern had time to shut\r\nthe gate, Fouquet sprang through it, and ran forward in spite of the\r\nsoldier, who cried out for assistance. Fouquet gained ground, regardless\r\nof the cries of the man, who, however, having at last come up with\r\nFouquet, called out to the sentinel of the second gate, “Look out, look\r\nout, sentinel!” The man crossed his pike before the minister; but\r\nthe latter, robust and active, and hurried away, too, by his passion,\r\nwrested the pike from the soldier and struck him a violent blow on the\r\nshoulder with it. The subaltern, who approached too closely, received a\r\nshare of the blows as well. Both of them uttered loud and furious cries,\r\nat the sound of which the whole of the first body of the advanced guard\r\npoured out of the guardhouse. Among them there was one, however,\r\nwho recognized the superintendent, and who called, “Monseigneur, ah!\r\nmonseigneur. Stop, stop, you fellows!” And he effectually checked the\r\nsoldiers, who were on the point of revenging their companions. Fouquet\r\ndesired them to open the gate, but they refused to do so without the\r\ncountersign; he desired them to inform the governor of his presence;\r\nbut the latter had already heard the disturbance at the gate. He ran\r\nforward, followed by his major, and accompanied by a picket of twenty\r\nmen, persuaded that an attack was being made on the Bastile. Baisemeaux\r\nalso recognized Fouquet immediately, and dropped the sword he bravely\r\nhad been brandishing.\r\n\r\n“Ah! monseigneur,” he stammered, “how can I excuse--”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the superintendent, flushed with anger, and heated by\r\nhis exertions, “I congratulate you. Your watch and ward are admirably\r\nkept.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux turned pale, thinking that this remark was made ironically,\r\nand portended a furious burst of anger. But Fouquet had recovered his\r\nbreath, and, beckoning the sentinel and the subaltern, who were rubbing\r\ntheir shoulders, towards him, he said, “There are twenty pistoles for\r\nthe sentinel, and fifty for the officer. Pray receive my compliments,\r\ngentlemen. I will not fail to speak to his majesty about you. And now,\r\nM. Baisemeaux, a word with you.”\r\n\r\nAnd he followed the governor to his official residence, accompanied by\r\na murmur of general satisfaction. Baisemeaux was already trembling with\r\nshame and uneasiness. Aramis’s early visit, from that moment, seemed to\r\npossess consequences, which a functionary such as he (Baisemeaux) was,\r\nwas perfectly justified in apprehending. It was quite another thing,\r\nhowever, when Fouquet in a sharp tone of voice, and with an imperious\r\nlook, said, “You have seen M. d’Herblay this morning?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“And are you not horrified at the crime of which you have made yourself\r\nan accomplice?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” thought Baisemeaux, “good so far;” and then he added, aloud,\r\n“But what crime, monseigneur, do you allude to?”\r\n\r\n“That for which you can be quartered alive, monsieur--do not forget\r\nthat! But this is not a time to show anger. Conduct me immediately to\r\nthe prisoner.”\r\n\r\n“To what prisoner?” said Baisemeaux, trembling.\r\n\r\n“You pretend to be ignorant? Very good--it is the best plan for you,\r\nperhaps; for if, in fact, you were to admit your participation in such\r\na crime, it would be all over with you. I wish, therefore, to seem to\r\nbelieve in your assumption of ignorance.”\r\n\r\n“I entreat you, monseigneur--”\r\n\r\n“That will do. Lead me to the prisoner.”\r\n\r\n“To Marchiali?”\r\n\r\n“Who is Marchiali?”\r\n\r\n“The prisoner who was brought back this morning by M. d’Herblay.”\r\n\r\n“He is called Marchiali?” said the superintendent, his conviction\r\nsomewhat shaken by Baisemeaux’s cool manner.\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur; that is the name under which he was inscribed here.”\r\n\r\nFouquet looked steadily at Baisemeaux, as if he would read his very\r\nheart; and perceived, with that clear-sightedness most men possess who\r\nare accustomed to the exercise of power, that the man was speaking with\r\nperfect sincerity. Besides, in observing his face for a few moments, he\r\ncould not believe that Aramis would have chosen such a confidant.\r\n\r\n“It is the prisoner,” said the superintendent to him, “whom M. d’Herblay\r\ncarried away the day before yesterday?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“And whom he brought back this morning?” added Fouquet, quickly: for he\r\nunderstood immediately the mechanism of Aramis’s plan.\r\n\r\n“Precisely, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“And his name is Marchiali, you say?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Marchiali. If monseigneur has come here to remove him, so much the\r\nbetter, for I was going to write about him.”\r\n\r\n“What has he done, then?”\r\n\r\n“Ever since this morning he has annoyed me extremely. He has had such\r\nterrible fits of passion, as almost to make me believe that he would\r\nbring the Bastile itself down about our ears.”\r\n\r\n“I will soon relieve you of his possession,” said Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Ah! so much the better.”\r\n\r\n“Conduct me to his prison.”\r\n\r\n“Will monseigneur give me the order?”\r\n\r\n“What order?”\r\n\r\n“An order from the king.”\r\n\r\n“Wait until I sign you one.”\r\n\r\n“That will not be sufficient, monseigneur. I must have an order from the\r\nking.”\r\n\r\nFouquet assumed an irritated expression. “As you are so scrupulous,” he\r\nsaid, “with regard to allowing prisoners to leave, show me the order by\r\nwhich this one was set at liberty.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux showed him the order to release Seldon.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said Fouquet; “but Seldon is not Marchiali.”\r\n\r\n“But Marchiali is not at liberty, monseigneur; he is here.”\r\n\r\n“But you said that M. d’Herblay carried him away and brought him back\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“I did not say so.”\r\n\r\n“So surely did you say it, that I almost seem to hear it now.”\r\n\r\n“It was a slip of my tongue, then, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Take care, M. Baisemeaux, take care.”\r\n\r\n“I have nothing to fear, monseigneur; I am acting according to the very\r\nstrictest regulation.”\r\n\r\n“Do you dare to say so?”\r\n\r\n“I would say so in the presence of one of the apostles. M. d’Herblay\r\nbrought me an order to set Seldon at liberty. Seldon is free.”\r\n\r\n“I tell you that Marchiali has left the Bastile.”\r\n\r\n“You must prove that, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Let me see him.”\r\n\r\n“You, monseigneur, who govern this kingdom, know very well that no one\r\ncan see any of the prisoners without an express order from the king.”\r\n\r\n“M. d’Herblay has entered, however.”\r\n\r\n“That remains to be proved, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“M. de Baisemeaux, once more I warn you to pay particular attention to\r\nwhat you are saying.”\r\n\r\n“All the documents are there, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“M. d’Herblay is overthrown.”\r\n\r\n“Overthrown?--M. d’Herblay! Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“You see that he has undoubtedly influenced you.”\r\n\r\n“No, monseigneur; what does, in fact, influence me, is the king’s\r\nservice. I am doing my duty. Give me an order from him, and you shall\r\nenter.”\r\n\r\n“Stay, M. le gouverneur, I give you my word that if you allow me to see\r\nthe prisoner, I will give you an order from the king at once.”\r\n\r\n“Give it to me now, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“And that, if you refuse me, I will have you and all your officers\r\narrested on the spot.”\r\n\r\n“Before you commit such an act of violence, monseigneur, you will\r\nreflect,” said Baisemeaux, who had turned very pale, “that we will only\r\nobey an order signed by the king; and that it will be just as easy for\r\nyou to obtain one to see Marchiali as to obtain one to do me so much\r\ninjury; me, too, who am perfectly innocent.”\r\n\r\n“True. True!” cried Fouquet, furiously; “perfectly true. M. de\r\nBaisemeaux,” he added, in a sonorous voice, drawing the unhappy governor\r\ntowards him, “do you know why I am so anxious to speak to the prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“No, monseigneur; and allow me to observe that you are terrifying me out\r\nof my senses; I am trembling all over--in fact, I feel as though I were\r\nabout to faint.”\r\n\r\n“You will stand a better chance of fainting outright, Monsieur\r\nBaisemeaux, when I return here at the head of ten thousand men and\r\nthirty pieces of cannon.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens, monseigneur, you are losing your senses.”\r\n\r\n“When I have roused the whole population of Paris against you and your\r\naccursed towers, and have battered open the gates of this place, and\r\nhanged you to the topmost tree of yonder pinnacle!”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur! monseigneur! for pity’s sake!”\r\n\r\n“I give you ten minutes to make up your mind,” added Fouquet, in a calm\r\nvoice. “I will sit down here, in this armchair, and wait for you; if,\r\nin ten minutes’ time, you still persist, I leave this place, and you may\r\nthink me as mad as you like. Then--you shall _see!_”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux stamped his foot on the ground like a man in a state of\r\ndespair, but he did not reply a single syllable; whereupon Fouquet\r\nseized a pen and ink, and wrote:\r\n\r\n“Order for M. le Prevot des Marchands to assemble the municipal guard\r\nand to march upon the Bastile on the king’s immediate service.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux shrugged his shoulders. Fouquet wrote:\r\n\r\n“Order for the Duc de Bouillon and M. le Prince de Conde to assume the\r\ncommand of the Swiss guards, of the king’s guards, and to march upon the\r\nBastile on the king’s immediate service.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux reflected. Fouquet still wrote:\r\n\r\n“Order for every soldier, citizen, or gentleman to seize and apprehend,\r\nwherever he may be found, le Chevalier d’Herblay, Eveque de Vannes,\r\nand his accomplices, who are: first, M. de Baisemeaux, governor of the\r\nBastile, suspected of the crimes of high treason and rebellion--”\r\n\r\n“Stop, monseigneur!” cried Baisemeaux; “I do not understand a single\r\njot of the whole matter; but so many misfortunes, even were it madness\r\nitself that had set them at their awful work, might happen here in\r\na couple of hours, that the king, by whom I must be judged, will see\r\nwhether I have been wrong in withdrawing the countersign before this\r\nflood of imminent catastrophes. Come with me to the keep, monseigneur,\r\nyou shall see Marchiali.”\r\n\r\nFouquet darted out of the room, followed by Baisemeaux as he wiped the\r\nperspiration from his face. “What a terrible morning!” he said; “what a\r\ndisgrace for _me!_”\r\n\r\n“Walk faster,” replied Fouquet.\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux made a sign to the jailer to precede them. He was afraid of\r\nhis companion, which the latter could not fail to perceive.\r\n\r\n“A truce to this child’s play,” he said, roughly. “Let the man remain\r\nhere; take the keys yourself, and show me the way. Not a single person,\r\ndo you understand, must hear what is going to take place here.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Baisemeaux, undecided.\r\n\r\n“Again!” cried M. Fouquet. “Ah! say ‘no’ at once, and I will leave the\r\nBastile and will myself carry my own dispatches.”\r\n\r\nBaisemeaux bowed his head, took the keys, and unaccompanied, except by\r\nthe minister, ascended the staircase. The higher they advanced up the\r\nspiral staircase, the more clearly did certain muffled murmurs become\r\ndistinct appeals and fearful imprecations.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” asked Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“That is your Marchiali,” said the governor; “this is the way these\r\nmadmen scream.”\r\n\r\nAnd he accompanied that reply with a glance more pregnant with injurious\r\nallusion, as far as Fouquet was concerned, than politeness. The latter\r\ntrembled; he had just recognized in one cry more terrible than any that\r\nhad preceded it, the king’s voice. He paused on the staircase, snatching\r\nthe bunch of keys from Baisemeaux, who thought this new madman was going\r\nto dash out his brains with one of them. “Ah!” he cried, “M. d’Herblay\r\ndid not say a word about that.”\r\n\r\n“Give me the keys at once!” cried Fouquet, tearing them from his hand.\r\n“Which is the key of the door I am to open?”\r\n\r\n“That one.”\r\n\r\nA fearful cry, followed by a violent blow against the door, made the\r\nwhole staircase resound with the echo.\r\n\r\n“Leave this place,” said Fouquet to Baisemeaux, in a threatening tone.\r\n\r\n“I ask nothing better,” murmured the latter, to himself. “There will be\r\na couple of madmen face to face, and the one will kill the other, I am\r\nsure.”\r\n\r\n“Go!” repeated Fouquet. “If you place your foot on this staircase\r\nbefore I call you, remember that you shall take the place of the meanest\r\nprisoner in the Bastile.”\r\n\r\n“This job will kill me, I am sure it will,” muttered Baisemeaux, as he\r\nwithdrew with tottering steps.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner’s cries became more and more terrible. When Fouquet\r\nhad satisfied himself that Baisemeaux had reached the bottom of the\r\nstaircase, he inserted the key in the first lock. It was then that he\r\nheard the hoarse, choking voice of the king, crying out, in a frenzy of\r\nrage, “Help, help! I am the king.” The key of the second door was not\r\nthe same as the first, and Fouquet was obliged to look for it on the\r\nbunch. The king, however, furious and almost mad with rage and passion,\r\nshouted at the top of his voice, “It was M. Fouquet who brought me here.\r\nHelp me against M. Fouquet! I am the king! Help the king against\r\nM. Fouquet!” These cries filled the minister’s heart with terrible\r\nemotions. They were followed by a shower of blows leveled against the\r\ndoor with a part of the broken chair with which the king had armed\r\nhimself. Fouquet at last succeeded in finding the key. The king was\r\nalmost exhausted; he could hardly articulate distinctly as he shouted,\r\n“Death to Fouquet! death to the traitor Fouquet!” The door flew open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIII. The King’s Gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe two men were on the point of darting towards each other when they\r\nsuddenly and abruptly stopped, as a mutual recognition took place, and\r\neach uttered a cry of horror.\r\n\r\n“Have you come to assassinate me, monsieur?” said the king, when he\r\nrecognized Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“The king in this state!” murmured the minister.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more terrible indeed than the appearance of the young\r\nprince at the moment Fouquet had surprised him; his clothes were in\r\ntatters; his shirt, open and torn to rags, was stained with sweat\r\nand with the blood which streamed from his lacerated breast and arms.\r\nHaggard, ghastly pale, his hair in disheveled masses, Louis XIV.\r\npresented the most perfect picture of despair, distress, anger and fear\r\ncombined that could possibly be united in one figure. Fouquet was so\r\ntouched, so affected and disturbed by it, that he ran towards him with\r\nhis arms stretched out and his eyes filled with tears. Louis held up the\r\nmassive piece of wood of which he had made such a furious use.\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said Fouquet, in a voice trembling with emotion, “do you not\r\nrecognize the most faithful of your friends?”\r\n\r\n“A friend--you!” repeated Louis, gnashing his teeth in a manner which\r\nbetrayed his hate and desire for speedy vengeance.\r\n\r\n“The most respectful of your servants,” added Fouquet, throwing himself\r\non his knees. The king let the rude weapon fall from his grasp.\r\nFouquet approached him, kissed his knees, and took him in his arms with\r\ninconceivable tenderness.\r\n\r\n“My king, my child,” he said, “how you must have suffered!”\r\n\r\nLouis, recalled to himself by the change of situation, looked at\r\nhimself, and ashamed of the disordered state of his apparel, ashamed\r\nof his conduct, and ashamed of the air of pity and protection that was\r\nshown towards him, drew back. Fouquet did not understand this movement;\r\nhe did not perceive that the king’s feeling of pride would never forgive\r\nhim for having been a witness of such an exhibition of weakness.\r\n\r\n“Come, sire,” he said, “you are free.”\r\n\r\n“Free?” repeated the king. “Oh! you set me at liberty, then, after\r\nhaving dared to lift up your hand against me.”\r\n\r\n“You do not believe that!” exclaimed Fouquet, indignantly; “you cannot\r\nbelieve me to be guilty of such an act.”\r\n\r\nAnd rapidly, warmly even, he related the whole particulars of the\r\nintrigue, the details of which are already known to the reader. While\r\nthe recital continued, Louis suffered the most horrible anguish of mind;\r\nand when it was finished, the magnitude of the danger he had run struck\r\nhim far more than the importance of the secret relative to his twin\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” he said, suddenly to Fouquet, “this double birth is a\r\nfalsehood; it is impossible--you cannot have been the dupe of it.”\r\n\r\n“Sire!”\r\n\r\n“It is impossible, I tell you, that the honor, the virtue of my mother\r\ncan be suspected, and my first minister has not yet done justice on the\r\ncriminals!”\r\n\r\n“Reflect, sire, before you are hurried away by anger,” replied Fouquet.\r\n“The birth of your brother--”\r\n\r\n“I have only one brother--and that is Monsieur. You know it as well as\r\nmyself. There is a plot, I tell you, beginning with the governor of the\r\nBastile.”\r\n\r\n“Be careful, sire, for this man has been deceived as every one else has\r\nby the prince’s likeness to yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Likeness? Absurd!”\r\n\r\n“This Marchiali must be singularly like your majesty, to be able to\r\ndeceive every one’s eye,” Fouquet persisted.\r\n\r\n“Ridiculous!”\r\n\r\n“Do not say so, sire; those who had prepared everything in order to face\r\nand deceive your ministers, your mother, your officers of state, the\r\nmembers of your family, must be quite confident of the resemblance\r\nbetween you.”\r\n\r\n“But where are these persons, then?” murmured the king.\r\n\r\n“At Vaux.”\r\n\r\n“At Vaux! and you suffer them to remain there!”\r\n\r\n“My most instant duty appeared to me to be your majesty’s release. I\r\nhave accomplished that duty; and now, whatever your majesty may command,\r\nshall be done. I await your orders.”\r\n\r\nLouis reflected for a few moments.\r\n\r\n“Muster all the troops in Paris,” he said.\r\n\r\n“All the necessary orders are given for that purpose,” replied Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“You have given orders!” exclaimed the king.\r\n\r\n“For that purpose, yes, sire; your majesty will be at the head of ten\r\nthousand men in less than an hour.”\r\n\r\nThe only reply the king made was to take hold of Fouquet’s hand with\r\nsuch an expression of feeling, that it was very easy to perceive how\r\nstrongly he had, until that remark, maintained his suspicions of the\r\nminister, notwithstanding the latter’s intervention.\r\n\r\n“And with these troops,” he said, “we shall go at once and besiege\r\nin your house the rebels who by this time will have established and\r\nintrenched themselves therein.”\r\n\r\n“I should be surprised if that were the case,” replied Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because their chief--the very soul of the enterprise--having been\r\nunmasked by me, the whole plan seems to me to have miscarried.”\r\n\r\n“You have unmasked this false prince also?”\r\n\r\n“No, I have not seen him.”\r\n\r\n“Whom have you seen, then?”\r\n\r\n“The leader of the enterprise, not that unhappy young man; the latter is\r\nmerely an instrument, destined through his whole life to wretchedness, I\r\nplainly perceive.”\r\n\r\n“Most certainly.”\r\n\r\n“It is M. l’Abbe d’Herblay, Eveque de Vannes.”\r\n\r\n“Your friend?”\r\n\r\n“He was my friend, sire,” replied Fouquet, nobly.\r\n\r\n“An unfortunate circumstance for you,” said the king, in a less generous\r\ntone of voice.\r\n\r\n“Such friendships, sire, had nothing dishonorable in them so long as I\r\nwas ignorant of the crime.”\r\n\r\n“You should have foreseen it.”\r\n\r\n“If I am guilty, I place myself in your majesty’s hands.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! Monsieur Fouquet, it was not that I meant,” returned the king,\r\nsorry to have shown the bitterness of his thought in such a manner.\r\n“Well! I assure you that, notwithstanding the mask with which the\r\nvillain covered his face, I had something like a vague suspicion that he\r\nwas the very man. But with this chief of the enterprise there was a\r\nman of prodigious strength, the one who menaced me with a force almost\r\nherculean; what is he?”\r\n\r\n“It must be his friend the Baron du Vallon, formerly one of the\r\nmusketeers.”\r\n\r\n“The friend of D’Artagnan? the friend of the Comte de la Fere? Ah!”\r\n exclaimed the king, as he paused at the name of the latter, “we must not\r\nforget the connection that existed between the conspirators and M. de\r\nBragelonne.”\r\n\r\n“Sire, sire, do not go too far. M. de la Fere is the most honorable man\r\nin France. Be satisfied with those whom I deliver up to you.”\r\n\r\n“With those whom you deliver up to me, you say? Very good, for you will\r\ndeliver up those who are guilty to me.”\r\n\r\n“What does your majesty understand by that?” inquired Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“I understand,” replied the king, “that we shall soon arrive at Vaux\r\nwith a large body of troops, that we will lay violent hands upon that\r\nnest of vipers, and that not a soul shall escape.”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty will put these men to death!” cried Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“To the very meanest of them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! sire.”\r\n\r\n“Let us understand one another, Monsieur Fouquet,” said the king,\r\nhaughtily. “We no longer live in times when assassination was the only\r\nand the last resource kings held in reservation at extremity. No, Heaven\r\nbe praised! I have parliaments who sit and judge in my name, and I have\r\nscaffolds on which supreme authority is carried out.”\r\n\r\nFouquet turned pale. “I will take the liberty of observing to your\r\nmajesty, that any proceedings instituted respecting these matters would\r\nbring down the greatest scandal upon the dignity of the throne. The\r\naugust name of Anne of Austria must never be allowed to pass the lips of\r\nthe people accompanied by a smile.”\r\n\r\n“Justice must be done, however, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Good, sire; but royal blood must not be shed upon a scaffold.”\r\n\r\n“The royal blood! you believe that!” cried the king with fury in\r\nhis voice, stamping his foot on the ground. “This double birth is an\r\ninvention; and in that invention, particularly, do I see M. d’Herblay’s\r\ncrime. It is the crime I wish to punish rather than the violence, or the\r\ninsult.”\r\n\r\n“And punish it with death, sire?”\r\n\r\n“With death; yes, monsieur, I have said it.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said the surintendant, with firmness, as he raised his head\r\nproudly, “your majesty will take the life, if you please, of your\r\nbrother Philippe of France; that concerns you alone, and you will\r\ndoubtless consult the queen-mother upon the subject. Whatever she may\r\ncommand will be perfectly correct. I do not wish to mix myself up in it,\r\nnot even for the honor of your crown, but I have a favor to ask of you,\r\nand I beg to submit it to you.”\r\n\r\n“Speak,” said the king, in no little degree agitated by his minister’s\r\nlast words. “What do you require?”\r\n\r\n“The pardon of M. d’Herblay and of M. du Vallon.”\r\n\r\n“My assassins?”\r\n\r\n“Two rebels, sire, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I understand, then, you ask me to forgive your friends.”\r\n\r\n“My friends!” said Fouquet, deeply wounded.\r\n\r\n“Your friends, certainly; but the safety of the state requires that an\r\nexemplary punishment should be inflicted on the guilty.”\r\n\r\n“I will not permit myself to remind your majesty that I have just\r\nrestored you to liberty, and have saved your life.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur!”\r\n\r\n“I will not allow myself to remind your majesty that had M. d’Herblay\r\nwished to carry out his character of an assassin, he could very easily\r\nhave assassinated your majesty this morning in the forest of Senart, and\r\nall would have been over.” The king started.\r\n\r\n“A pistol-bullet through the head,” pursued Fouquet, “and the disfigured\r\nfeatures of Louis XIV., which no one could have recognized, would be M.\r\nd’Herblay’s complete and entire justification.”\r\n\r\nThe king turned pale and giddy at the bare idea of the danger he had\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\n“If M. d’Herblay,” continued Fouquet, “had been an assassin, he had no\r\noccasion to inform me of his plan in order to succeed. Freed from the\r\nreal king, it would have been impossible in all futurity to guess the\r\nfalse. And if the usurper had been recognized by Anne of Austria,\r\nhe would still have been--her son. The usurper, as far as Monsieur\r\nd’Herblay’s conscience was concerned, was still a king of the blood of\r\nLouis XIII. Moreover, the conspirator, in that course, would have had\r\nsecurity, secrecy, impunity. A pistol-bullet would have procured him all\r\nthat. For the sake of Heaven, sire, grant me his forgiveness.”\r\n\r\nThe king, instead of being touched by the picture, so faithfully drawn\r\nin all details, of Aramis’s generosity, felt himself most painfully and\r\ncruelly humiliated. His unconquerable pride revolted at the idea that a\r\nman had held suspended at the end of his finger the thread of his royal\r\nlife. Every word that fell from Fouquet’s lips, and which he thought\r\nmost efficacious in procuring his friend’s pardon, seemed to pour\r\nanother drop of poison into the already ulcerated heart of Louis XIV.\r\nNothing could bend or soften him. Addressing himself to Fouquet, he\r\nsaid, “I really don’t know, monsieur, why you should solicit the pardon\r\nof these men. What good is there in asking that which can be obtained\r\nwithout solicitation?”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you, sire.”\r\n\r\n“It is not difficult, either. Where am I now?”\r\n\r\n“In the Bastile, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; in a dungeon. I am looked upon as a madman, am I not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“And no one is known here but Marchiali?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Well; change nothing in the position of affairs. Let the poor madman\r\nrot between the slimy walls of the Bastile, and M. d’Herblay and M.\r\ndu Vallon will stand in no need of my forgiveness. Their new king will\r\nabsolve them.”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty does me a great injustice, sire; and you are wrong,”\r\n replied Fouquet, dryly; “I am not child enough, nor is M. d’Herblay\r\nsilly enough, to have omitted to make all these reflections; and if I\r\nhad wished to make a new king, as you say, I had no occasion to have\r\ncome here to force open the gates and doors of the Bastile, to free\r\nyou from this place. That would show a want of even common sense. Your\r\nmajesty’s mind is disturbed by anger; otherwise you would be far from\r\noffending, groundlessly, the very one of your servants who has rendered\r\nyou the most important service of all.”\r\n\r\nLouis perceived that he had gone too far; that the gates of the Bastile\r\nwere still closed upon him, whilst, by degrees, the floodgates were\r\ngradually being opened, behind which the generous-hearted Fouquet had\r\nrestrained his anger. “I did not say that to humiliate you, Heaven\r\nknows, monsieur,” he replied. “Only you are addressing yourself to me in\r\norder to obtain a pardon, and I answer according to my conscience. And\r\nso, judging by my conscience, the criminals we speak of are not worthy\r\nof consideration or forgiveness.”\r\n\r\nFouquet was silent.\r\n\r\n“What I do is as generous,” added the king, “as what you have done, for\r\nI am in your power. I will even say it is more generous, inasmuch as you\r\nplace before me certain conditions upon which my liberty, my life, may\r\ndepend; and to reject which is to make a sacrifice of both.”\r\n\r\n“I was wrong, certainly,” replied Fouquet. “Yes,--I had the appearance\r\nof extorting a favor; I regret it, and entreat your majesty’s\r\nforgiveness.”\r\n\r\n“And you are forgiven, my dear Monsieur Fouquet,” said the king, with\r\na smile, which restored the serene expression of his features, which so\r\nmany circumstances had altered since the preceding evening.\r\n\r\n“I have my own forgiveness,” replied the minister, with some degree of\r\npersistence; “but M. d’Herblay, and M. du Vallon?”\r\n\r\n“They will never obtain theirs, as long as I live,” replied the\r\ninflexible king. “Do me the kindness not to speak of it again.”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty shall be obeyed.”\r\n\r\n“And you will bear me no ill-will for it?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no, sire; for I anticipated the event.”\r\n\r\n“You had ‘anticipated’ that I should refuse to forgive those gentlemen?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly; and all my measures were taken in consequence.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean to say?” cried the king, surprised.\r\n\r\n“M. d’Herblay came, as may be said, to deliver himself into my hands. M.\r\nd’Herblay left to me the happiness of saving my king and my country. I\r\ncould not condemn M. d’Herblay to death; nor could I, on the other hand,\r\nexpose him to your majesty’s justifiable wrath; it would have been just\r\nthe same as if I had killed him myself.”\r\n\r\n“Well! and what have you done?”\r\n\r\n“Sire, I gave M. d’Herblay the best horses in my stables and four hours’\r\nstart over all those your majesty might, probably, dispatch after him.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so!” murmured the king. “But still, the world is wide enough\r\nand large enough for those whom I may send to overtake your horses,\r\nnotwithstanding the ‘four hours’ start’ which you have given to M.\r\nd’Herblay.”\r\n\r\n“In giving him these four hours, sire, I knew I was giving him his life,\r\nand he will save his life.”\r\n\r\n“In what way?”\r\n\r\n“After having galloped as hard as possible, with the four hours’ start,\r\nbefore your musketeers, he will reach my chateau of Belle-Isle, where I\r\nhave given him a safe asylum.”\r\n\r\n“That may be! But you forget that you have made me a present of\r\nBelle-Isle.”\r\n\r\n“But not for you to arrest my friends.”\r\n\r\n“You take it back again, then?”\r\n\r\n“As far as that goes--yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“My musketeers shall capture it, and the affair will be at an end.”\r\n\r\n“Neither your musketeers, nor your whole army could take Belle-Isle,”\r\n said Fouquet, coldly. “Belle-Isle is impregnable.”\r\n\r\nThe king became perfectly livid; a lightning flash seemed to dart from\r\nhis eyes. Fouquet felt that he was lost, but he as not one to shrink\r\nwhen the voice of honor spoke loudly within him. He bore the king’s\r\nwrathful gaze; the latter swallowed his rage, and after a few moments’\r\nsilence, said, “Are we going to return to Vaux?”\r\n\r\n“I am at your majesty’s orders,” replied Fouquet, with a low bow; “but\r\nI think that your majesty can hardly dispense with changing your clothes\r\nprevious to appearing before your court.”\r\n\r\n“We shall pass by the Louvre,” said the king. “Come.” And they left the\r\nprison, passing before Baisemeaux, who looked completely bewildered as\r\nhe saw Marchiali once more leave; and, in his helplessness, tore out\r\nthe major portion of his few remaining hairs. It was perfectly true,\r\nhowever, that Fouquet wrote and gave him an authority for the prisoner’s\r\nrelease, and that the king wrote beneath it, “Seen and approved, Louis”;\r\na piece of madness that Baisemeaux, incapable of putting two ideas\r\ntogether, acknowledged by giving himself a terrible blow on the forehead\r\nwith his own fist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIV. The False King.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, usurped royalty was playing out its part bravely at\r\nVaux. Philippe gave orders that for his _petit lever_ the _grandes\r\nentrees_, already prepared to appear before the king, should be\r\nintroduced. He determined to give this order notwithstanding the absence\r\nof M. d’Herblay, who did not return--our readers know the reason. But\r\nthe prince, not believing that absence could be prolonged, wished,\r\nas all rash spirits do, to try his valor and his fortune far from all\r\nprotection and instruction. Another reason urged him to this--Anne of\r\nAustria was about to appear; the guilty mother was about to stand in the\r\npresence of her sacrificed son. Philippe was not willing, if he had a\r\nweakness, to render the man a witness of it before whom he was bound\r\nthenceforth to display so much strength. Philippe opened his folding\r\ndoors, and several persons entered silently. Philippe did not stir\r\nwhilst his _valets de chambre_ dressed him. He had watched, the evening\r\nbefore, all the habits of his brother, and played the king in such a\r\nmanner as to awaken no suspicion. He was thus completely dressed in\r\nhunting costume when he received his visitors. His own memory and\r\nthe notes of Aramis announced everybody to him, first of all Anne of\r\nAustria, to whom Monsieur gave his hand, and then Madame with M. de\r\nSaint-Aignan. He smiled at seeing these countenances, but trembled on\r\nrecognizing his mother. That still so noble and imposing figure, ravaged\r\nby pain, pleaded in his heart the cause of the famous queen who had\r\nimmolated a child to reasons of state. He found his mother still\r\nhandsome. He knew that Louis XIV. loved her, and he promised himself\r\nto love her likewise, and not to prove a scourge to her old age. He\r\ncontemplated his brother with a tenderness easily to be understood.\r\nThe latter had usurped nothing, had cast no shades athwart his life. A\r\nseparate tree, he allowed the stem to rise without heeding its elevation\r\nor majestic life. Philippe promised himself to be a kind brother to this\r\nprince, who required nothing but gold to minister to his pleasures. He\r\nbowed with a friendly air to Saint-Aignan, who was all reverences and\r\nsmiles, and trembling held out his hand to Henrietta, his sister-in-law,\r\nwhose beauty struck him; but he saw in the eyes of that princess an\r\nexpression of coldness which would facilitate, as he thought, their\r\nfuture relations.\r\n\r\n“How much more easy,” thought he, “it will be to be the brother of that\r\nwoman than her gallant, if she evinces towards me a coldness that my\r\nbrother could not have for her, but which is imposed upon me as a duty.”\r\n The only visit he dreaded at this moment was that of the queen; his\r\nheart--his mind--had just been shaken by so violent a trial, that,\r\nin spite of their firm temperament, they would not, perhaps, support\r\nanother shock. Happily the queen did not come. Then commenced, on the\r\npart of Anne of Austria, a political dissertation upon the welcome M.\r\nFouquet had given to the house of France. She mixed up hostilities with\r\ncompliments addressed to the king, and questions as to his health, with\r\nlittle maternal flatteries and diplomatic artifices.\r\n\r\n“Well, my son,” said she, “are you convinced with regard to M. Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“Saint-Aignan,” said Philippe, “have the goodness to go and inquire\r\nafter the queen.”\r\n\r\nAt these words, the first Philippe had pronounced aloud, the slight\r\ndifference that there was between his voice and that of the king was\r\nsensible to maternal ears, and Anne of Austria looked earnestly at her\r\nson. Saint-Aignan left the room, and Philippe continued:\r\n\r\n“Madame, I do not like to hear M. Fouquet ill-spoken of, you know I do\r\nnot--and you have even spoken well of him yourself.”\r\n\r\n“That is true; therefore I only question you on the state of your\r\nsentiments with respect to him.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said Henrietta, “I, on my part, have always liked M. Fouquet. He\r\nis a man of good taste,--a superior man.”\r\n\r\n“A superintendent who is never sordid or niggardly,” added Monsieur;\r\n“and who pays in gold all the orders I have on him.”\r\n\r\n“Every one in this thinks too much of himself, and nobody for the\r\nstate,” said the old queen. “M. Fouquet, it is a fact, M. Fouquet is\r\nruining the state.”\r\n\r\n“Well, mother!” replied Philippe, in rather a lower key, “do you\r\nlikewise constitute yourself the buckler of M. Colbert?”\r\n\r\n“How is that?” replied the old queen, rather surprised.\r\n\r\n“Why, in truth,” replied Philippe, “you speak that just as your old\r\nfriend Madame de Chevreuse would speak.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you mention Madame de Chevreuse to me?” said she, “and what sort\r\nof humor are you in to-day towards me?”\r\n\r\nPhilippe continued: “Is not Madame de Chevreuse always in league against\r\nsomebody? Has not Madame de Chevreuse been to pay you a visit, mother?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, you speak to me now in such a manner that I can almost fancy\r\nI am listening to your father.”\r\n\r\n“My father did not like Madame de Chevreuse, and had good reason for not\r\nliking her,” said the prince. “For my part, I like her no better than\r\n_he_ did, and if she thinks proper to come here as she formerly did, to\r\nsow divisions and hatreds under the pretext of begging money--why--”\r\n\r\n“Well! what?” said Anne of Austria, proudly, herself provoking the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n“Well!” replied the young man firmly, “I will drive Madame de Chevreuse\r\nout of my kingdom--and with her all who meddle with its secrets and\r\nmysteries.”\r\n\r\nHe had not calculated the effect of this terrible speech, or perhaps\r\nhe wished to judge the effect of it, like those who, suffering from a\r\nchronic pain, and seeking to break the monotony of that suffering,\r\ntouch their wound to procure a sharper pang. Anne of Austria was nearly\r\nfainting; her eyes, open but meaningless, ceased to see for several\r\nseconds; she stretched out her arms towards her other son, who supported\r\nand embraced her without fear of irritating the king.\r\n\r\n“Sire,” murmured she, “you are treating your mother very cruelly.”\r\n\r\n“In what respect, madame?” replied he. “I am only speaking of Madame de\r\nChevreuse; does my mother prefer Madame de Chevreuse to the security\r\nof the state and of my person? Well, then, madame, I tell you Madame de\r\nChevreuse has returned to France to borrow money, and that she addressed\r\nherself to M. Fouquet to sell him a certain secret.”\r\n\r\n“A certain secret!” cried Anne of Austria.\r\n\r\n“Concerning pretended robberies that monsieur le surintendant had\r\ncommitted, which is false,” added Philippe. “M. Fouquet rejected her\r\noffers with indignation, preferring the esteem of the king to complicity\r\nwith such intriguers. Then Madame de Chevreuse sold the secret to M.\r\nColbert, and as she is insatiable, and was not satisfied with having\r\nextorted a hundred thousand crowns from a servant of the state, she has\r\ntaken a still bolder flight, in search of surer sources of supply. Is\r\nthat true, madame?”\r\n\r\n“You know all, sire,” said the queen, more uneasy than irritated.\r\n\r\n“Now,” continued Philippe, “I have good reason to dislike this fury, who\r\ncomes to my court to plan the shame of some and the ruin of others. If\r\nHeaven has suffered certain crimes to be committed, and has concealed\r\nthem in the shadow of its clemency, I will not permit Madame de\r\nChevreuse to counteract the just designs of fate.”\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this speech had so agitated the queen-mother, that\r\nher son had pity on her. He took her hand and kissed it tenderly;\r\nshe did not feel that in that kiss, given in spite of repulsion\r\nand bitterness of the heart, there was a pardon for eight years of\r\nsuffering. Philippe allowed the silence of a moment to swallow the\r\nemotions that had just developed themselves. Then, with a cheerful\r\nsmile:\r\n\r\n“We will not go to-day,” said he, “I have a plan.” And, turning towards\r\nthe door, he hoped to see Aramis, whose absence began to alarm him. The\r\nqueen-mother wished to leave the room.\r\n\r\n“Remain where you are, mother,” said he, “I wish you to make your peace\r\nwith M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\n“I bear M. Fouquet no ill-will; I only dreaded his prodigalities.”\r\n\r\n“We will put that to rights, and will take nothing of the superintendent\r\nbut his good qualities.”\r\n\r\n“What is your majesty looking for?” said Henrietta, seeing the king’s\r\neyes constantly turned towards the door, and wishing to let fly a little\r\npoisoned arrow at his heart, supposing he was so anxiously expecting\r\neither La Vallière or a letter from her.\r\n\r\n“My sister,” said the young man, who had divined her thought, thanks to\r\nthat marvelous perspicuity of which fortune was from that time about to\r\nallow him the exercise, “my sister, I am expecting a most distinguished\r\nman, a most able counselor, whom I wish to present to you all,\r\nrecommending him to your good graces. Ah! come in, then, D’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“What does your majesty wish?” said D’Artagnan, appearing.\r\n\r\n“Where is monsieur the bishop of Vannes, your friend?”\r\n\r\n“Why, sire--”\r\n\r\n“I am waiting for him, and he does not come. Let him be sought for.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan remained for an instant stupefied; but soon, reflecting that\r\nAramis had left Vaux privately on a mission from the king, he concluded\r\nthat the king wished to preserve the secret. “Sire,” replied he, “does\r\nyour majesty absolutely require M. d’Herblay to be brought to you?”\r\n\r\n“Absolutely is not the word,” said Philippe; “I do not want him so\r\nparticularly as that; but if he can be found--”\r\n\r\n“I thought so,” said D’Artagnan to himself.\r\n\r\n“Is this M. d’Herblay the bishop of Vannes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame.”\r\n\r\n“A friend of M. Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, madame; an old musketeer.”\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria blushed.\r\n\r\n“One of the four braves who formerly performed such prodigies.”\r\n\r\nThe old queen repented of having wished to bite; she broke off the\r\nconversation, in order to preserve the rest of her teeth. “Whatever may\r\nbe your choice, sire,” said she, “I have no doubt it will be excellent.”\r\n\r\nAll bowed in support of that sentiment.\r\n\r\n“You will find in him,” continued Philippe, “the depth and penetration\r\nof M. de Richelieu, without the avarice of M. de Mazarin!”\r\n\r\n“A prime minister, sire?” said Monsieur, in a fright.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you all about that, brother; but it is strange that M.\r\nd’Herblay is not here!”\r\n\r\nHe called out:\r\n\r\n“Let M. Fouquet be informed that I wish to speak to him--oh! before you,\r\nbefore you; do not retire!”\r\n\r\nM. de Saint-Aignan returned, bringing satisfactory news of the queen,\r\nwho only kept her bed from precaution, and to have strength to carry out\r\nthe king’s wishes. Whilst everybody was seeking M. Fouquet and Aramis,\r\nthe new king quietly continued his experiments, and everybody, family,\r\nofficers, servants, had not the least suspicion of his identity, his\r\nair, his voice, and manners were so like the king’s. On his side,\r\nPhilippe, applying to all countenances the accurate descriptions and\r\nkey-notes of character supplied by his accomplice Aramis, conducted\r\nhimself so as not to give birth to a doubt in the minds of those who\r\nsurrounded him. Nothing from that time could disturb the usurper. With\r\nwhat strange facility had Providence just reversed the loftiest fortune\r\nof the world to substitute the lowliest in its stead! Philippe admired\r\nthe goodness of God with regard to himself, and seconded it with all the\r\nresources of his admirable nature. But he felt, at times, something like\r\na specter gliding between him and the rays of his new glory. Aramis\r\ndid not appear. The conversation had languished in the royal family;\r\nPhilippe, preoccupied, forgot to dismiss his brother and Madame\r\nHenrietta. The latter were astonished, and began, by degrees, to\r\nlose all patience. Anne of Austria stooped towards her son’s ear and\r\naddressed some words to him in Spanish. Philippe was completely ignorant\r\nof that language, and grew pale at this unexpected obstacle. But, as\r\nif the spirit of the imperturbable Aramis had covered him with his\r\ninfallibility, instead of appearing disconcerted, Philippe rose. “Well!\r\nwhat?” said Anne of Austria.\r\n\r\n“What is all that noise?” said Philippe, turning round towards the door\r\nof the second staircase.\r\n\r\nAnd a voice was heard saying, “This way, this way! A few steps more,\r\nsire!”\r\n\r\n“The voice of M. Fouquet,” said D’Artagnan, who was standing close to\r\nthe queen-mother.\r\n\r\n“Then M. d’Herblay cannot be far off,” added Philippe.\r\n\r\nBut he then saw what he little thought to have beheld so near to him.\r\nAll eyes were turned towards the door at which M. Fouquet was expected\r\nto enter; but it was not M. Fouquet who entered. A terrible cry\r\nresounded from all corners of the chamber, a painful cry uttered by\r\nthe king and all present. It is given to but few men, even those\r\nwhose destiny contains the strangest elements, and accidents the\r\nmost wonderful, to contemplate such a spectacle similar to that which\r\npresented itself in the royal chamber at that moment. The half-closed\r\nshutters only admitted the entrance of an uncertain light passing\r\nthrough thick violet velvet curtains lined with silk. In this soft\r\nshade, the eyes were by degrees dilated, and every one present saw\r\nothers rather with imagination than with actual sight. There could not,\r\nhowever, escape, in these circumstances, one of the surrounding details;\r\nand the new object which presented itself appeared as luminous as though\r\nit shone out in full sunlight. So it happened with Louis XIV., when he\r\nshowed himself, pale and frowning, in the doorway of the secret stairs.\r\nThe face of Fouquet appeared behind him, stamped with sorrow and\r\ndetermination. The queen-mother, who perceived Louis XIV., and who held\r\nthe hand of Philippe, uttered a cry of which we have spoken, as if she\r\nbeheld a phantom. Monsieur was bewildered, and kept turning his head in\r\nastonishment from one to the other. Madame made a step forward, thinking\r\nshe was looking at the form of her brother-in-law reflected in a mirror.\r\nAnd, in fact, the illusion was possible. The two princes, both pale as\r\ndeath--for we renounce the hope of being able to describe the fearful\r\nstate of Philippe--trembling, clenching their hands convulsively,\r\nmeasured each other with looks, and darted their glances, sharp as\r\nponiards, at each other. Silent, panting, bending forward, they appeared\r\nas if about to spring upon an enemy. The unheard-of resemblance of\r\ncountenance, gesture, shape, height, even to the resemblance of costume,\r\nproduced by chance--for Louis XIV. had been to the Louvre and put on a\r\nviolet-colored dress--the perfect analogy of the two princes, completed\r\nthe consternation of Anne of Austria. And yet she did not at once guess\r\nthe truth. There are misfortunes in life so truly dreadful that no one\r\nwill at first accept them; people rather believe in the supernatural and\r\nthe impossible. Louis had not reckoned on these obstacles. He expected\r\nthat he had only to appear to be acknowledged. A living sun, he could\r\nnot endure the suspicion of equality with any one. He did not admit that\r\nevery torch should not become darkness at the instant he shone out with\r\nhis conquering ray. At the aspect of Philippe, then, he was perhaps more\r\nterrified than any one round him, and his silence, his immobility\r\nwere, this time, a concentration and a calm which precede the violent\r\nexplosions of concentrated passion.\r\n\r\nBut Fouquet! who shall paint his emotion and stupor in presence of this\r\nliving portrait of his master! Fouquet thought Aramis was right, that\r\nthis newly-arrived was a king as pure in his race as the other, and\r\nthat, for having repudiated all participation in this _coup d’etat_,\r\nso skillfully got up by the General of the Jesuits, he must be a mad\r\nenthusiast, unworthy of ever dipping his hands in political grand\r\nstrategy work. And then it was the blood of Louis XIII. which Fouquet\r\nwas sacrificing to the blood of Louis XIII.; it was to a selfish\r\nambition he was sacrificing a noble ambition; to the right of keeping\r\nhe sacrificed the right of having. The whole extent of his fault was\r\nrevealed to him at simple sight of the pretender. All that passed in the\r\nmind of Fouquet was lost upon the persons present. He had five minutes\r\nto focus meditation on this point of conscience; five minutes, that is\r\nto say five ages, during which the two kings and their family scarcely\r\nfound energy to breathe after so terrible a shock. D’Artagnan, leaning\r\nagainst the wall, in front of Fouquet, with his hand to his brow, asked\r\nhimself the cause of such a wonderful prodigy. He could not have said at\r\nonce why he doubted, but he knew assuredly that he had reason to doubt,\r\nand that in this meeting of the two Louis XIV.s lay all the doubt and\r\ndifficulty that during late days had rendered the conduct of Aramis so\r\nsuspicious to the musketeer. These ideas were, however, enveloped in a\r\nhaze, a veil of mystery. The actors in this assembly seemed to swim in\r\nthe vapors of a confused waking. Suddenly Louis XIV., more impatient and\r\nmore accustomed to command, ran to one of the shutters, which he opened,\r\ntearing the curtains in his eagerness. A flood of living light entered\r\nthe chamber, and made Philippe draw back to the alcove. Louis seized\r\nupon this movement with eagerness, and addressing himself to the queen:\r\n\r\n“My mother,” said he, “do you not acknowledge your son, since every one\r\nhere has forgotten his king!” Anne of Austria started, and raised her\r\narms towards Heaven, without being able to articulate a single word.\r\n\r\n“My mother,” said Philippe, with a calm voice, “do you not acknowledge\r\nyour son?” And this time, in his turn, Louis drew back.\r\n\r\nAs to Anne of Austria, struck suddenly in head and heart with fell\r\nremorse, she lost her equilibrium. No one aiding her, for all were\r\npetrified, she sank back in her fauteuil, breathing a weak, trembling\r\nsigh. Louis could not endure the spectacle and the affront. He bounded\r\ntowards D’Artagnan, over whose brain a vertigo was stealing and who\r\nstaggered as he caught at the door for support.\r\n\r\n“_A moi! mousquetaire!_” said he. “Look us in the face and say which is\r\nthe paler, he or I!”\r\n\r\nThis cry roused D’Artagnan, and stirred in his heart the fibers of\r\nobedience. He shook his head, and, without more hesitation, he walked\r\nstraight up to Philippe, on whose shoulder he laid his hand, saying,\r\n“Monsieur, you are my prisoner!”\r\n\r\nPhilippe did not raise his eyes towards Heaven, nor stir from the spot,\r\nwhere he seemed nailed to the floor, his eye intently fixed upon the\r\nking his brother. He reproached him with a sublime silence for all\r\nmisfortunes past, all tortures to come. Against this language of the\r\nsoul the king felt he had no power; he cast down his eyes, dragging away\r\nprecipitately his brother and sister, forgetting his mother, sitting\r\nmotionless within three paces of the son whom she left a second time to\r\nbe condemned to death. Philippe approached Anne of Austria, and said to\r\nher, in a soft and nobly agitated voice:\r\n\r\n“If I were not your son, I should curse you, my mother, for having\r\nrendered me so unhappy.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan felt a shudder pass through the marrow of his bones. He\r\nbowed respectfully to the young prince, and said as he bent, “Excuse me,\r\nmonseigneur, I am but a soldier, and my oaths are his who has just left\r\nthe chamber.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, M. d’Artagnan.... What has become of M. d’Herblay?”\r\n\r\n“M. d’Herblay is in safety, monseigneur,” said a voice behind them; “and\r\nno one, while I live and am free, shall cause a hair to fall from his\r\nhead.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Fouquet!” said the prince, smiling sadly.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, monseigneur,” said Fouquet, kneeling, “but he who is just\r\ngone out from hence was my guest.”\r\n\r\n“Here are,” murmured Philippe, with a sigh, “brave friends and good\r\nhearts. They make me regret the world. On, M. d’Artagnan, I follow you.”\r\n\r\nAt the moment the captain of the musketeers was about to leave the room\r\nwith his prisoner, Colbert appeared, and, after remitting an order from\r\nthe king to D’Artagnan, retired. D’Artagnan read the paper, and then\r\ncrushed it in his hand with rage.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked the prince.\r\n\r\n“Read, monseigneur,” replied the musketeer.\r\n\r\nPhilippe read the following words, hastily traced by the hand of the\r\nking:\r\n\r\n“M. d’Artagnan will conduct the prisoner to the Ile Sainte-Marguerite.\r\nHe will cover his face with an iron vizor, which the prisoner shall\r\nnever raise except at peril of his life.”\r\n\r\n“That is just,” said Philippe, with resignation; “I am ready.”\r\n\r\n“Aramis was right,” said Fouquet, in a low voice, to the musketeer,\r\n“this one is every whit as much a king as the other.”\r\n\r\n“More so!” replied D’Artagnan. “He wanted only you and me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXV. In Which Porthos Thinks He Is Pursuing a Duchy.\r\n\r\nAramis and Porthos, having profited by the time granted them by Fouquet,\r\ndid honor to the French cavalry by their speed. Porthos did not clearly\r\nunderstand on what kind of mission he was forced to display so much\r\nvelocity; but as he saw Aramis spurring on furiously, he, Porthos,\r\nspurred on in the same way. They had soon, in this manner, placed twelve\r\nleagues between them and Vaux; they were then obliged to change horses,\r\nand organize a sort of post arrangement. It was during a relay that\r\nPorthos ventured to interrogate Aramis discreetly.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” replied the latter, “know only that our fortune depends on our\r\nspeed.”\r\n\r\nAs if Porthos had still been the musketeer, without a sou or a _maille_\r\nof 1626, he pushed forward. That magic word “fortune” always means\r\nsomething in the human ear. It means _enough_ for those who have\r\nnothing; it means _too much_ for those who have enough.\r\n\r\n“I shall be made a duke!” said Porthos, aloud. He was speaking to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“That is possible,” replied Aramis, smiling after his own fashion, as\r\nPorthos’s horse passed him. Aramis felt, notwithstanding, as though his\r\nbrain were on fire; the activity of the body had not yet succeeded\r\nin subduing that of the mind. All there is of raging passion, mental\r\ntoothache or mortal threat, raged, gnawed and grumbled in the thoughts\r\nof the unhappy prelate. His countenance exhibited visible traces of this\r\nrude combat. Free on the highway to abandon himself to every impression\r\nof the moment, Aramis did not fail to swear at every start of his horse,\r\nat every inequality in the road. Pale, at times inundated with boiling\r\nsweats, then again dry and icy, he flogged his horses till the blood\r\nstreamed from their sides. Porthos, whose dominant fault was not\r\nsensibility, groaned at this. Thus traveled they on for eight long\r\nhours, and then arrived at Orleans. It was four o’clock in the\r\nafternoon. Aramis, on observing this, judged that nothing showed pursuit\r\nto be a possibility. It would be without example that a troop capable\r\nof taking him and Porthos should be furnished with relays sufficient to\r\nperform forty leagues in eight hours. Thus, admitting pursuit, which was\r\nnot at all manifest, the fugitives were five hours in advance of their\r\npursuers.\r\n\r\nAramis thought that there might be no imprudence in taking a little\r\nrest, but that to continue would make the matter more certain. Twenty\r\nleagues more, performed with the same rapidity, twenty more leagues\r\ndevoured, and no one, not even D’Artagnan, could overtake the enemies\r\nof the king. Aramis felt obliged, therefore, to inflict upon Porthos the\r\npain of mounting on horseback again. They rode on till seven o’clock in\r\nthe evening, and had only one post more between them and Blois. But here\r\na diabolical accident alarmed Aramis greatly. There were no horses at\r\nthe post. The prelate asked himself by what infernal machination\r\nhis enemies had succeeded in depriving him of the means of going\r\nfurther,--he who never recognized chance as a deity, who found a\r\ncause for every accident, preferred believing that the refusal of the\r\npostmaster, at such an hour, in such a country, was the consequence of\r\nan order emanating from above: an order given with a view of stopping\r\nshort the king-maker in the midst of his flight. But at the moment he\r\nwas about to fly into a passion, so as to procure either a horse or an\r\nexplanation, he was struck with the recollection that the Comte de la\r\nFere lived in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n“I am not traveling,” said he; “I do not want horses for a whole\r\nstage. Find me two horses to go and pay a visit to a nobleman of my\r\nacquaintance who resides near this place.”\r\n\r\n“What nobleman?” asked the postmaster.\r\n\r\n“M. le Comte de la Fere.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” replied the postmaster, uncovering with respect, “a very worthy\r\nnobleman. But, whatever may be my desire to make myself agreeable to\r\nhim, I cannot furnish you with horses, for all mine are engaged by M. le\r\nDuc de Beaufort.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said Aramis, much disappointed.\r\n\r\n“Only,” continued the postmaster, “if you will put up with a little\r\ncarriage I have, I will harness an old blind horse who has still his\r\nlegs left, and peradventure will draw you to the house of M. le Comte de\r\nla Fere.”\r\n\r\n“It is worth a louis,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur, such a ride is worth no more than a crown; that is what\r\nM. Grimaud, the comte’s intendant, always pays me when he makes use of\r\nthat carriage; and I should not wish the Comte de la Fere to have to\r\nreproach me with having imposed on one of his friends.”\r\n\r\n“As you please,” said Aramis, “particularly as regards disobliging the\r\nComte de la Fere; only I think I have a right to give you a louis for\r\nyour idea.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! doubtless,” replied the postmaster with delight. And he himself\r\nharnessed the ancient horse to the creaking carriage. In the meantime\r\nPorthos was curious to behold. He imagined he had discovered a clew to\r\nthe secret, and he felt pleased, because a visit to Athos, in the first\r\nplace, promised him much satisfaction, and, in the next, gave him the\r\nhope of finding at the same time a good bed and good supper. The master,\r\nhaving got the carriage ready, ordered one of his men to drive the\r\nstrangers to La Fere. Porthos took his seat by the side of Aramis,\r\nwhispering in his ear, “I understand.”\r\n\r\n“Aha!” said Aramis, “and what do you understand, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“We are going, on the part of the king, to make some great proposal to\r\nAthos.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh!” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“You need tell me nothing about it,” added the worthy Porthos,\r\nendeavoring to reseat himself so as to avoid the jolting, “you need tell\r\nme nothing, I shall guess.”\r\n\r\n“Well! do, my friend; guess away.”\r\n\r\nThey arrived at Athos’s dwelling about nine o’clock in the evening,\r\nfavored by a splendid moon. This cheerful light rejoiced Porthos beyond\r\nexpression; but Aramis appeared annoyed by it in an equal degree. He\r\ncould not help showing something of this to Porthos, who replied--“Ay!\r\nay! I guess how it is! the mission is a secret one.”\r\n\r\nThese were his last words in the carriage. The driver interrupted him by\r\nsaying, “Gentlemen, we have arrived.”\r\n\r\nPorthos and his companion alighted before the gate of the little\r\nchateau, where we are about to meet again our old acquaintances Athos\r\nand Bragelonne, the latter of whom had disappeared since the discovery\r\nof the infidelity of La Vallière. If there be one saying truer than\r\nanother, it is this: great griefs contain within themselves the germ\r\nof consolation. This painful wound, inflicted upon Raoul, had drawn\r\nhim nearer to his father again; and God knows how sweet were the\r\nconsolations which flowed from the eloquent mouth and generous heart of\r\nAthos. The wound was not cicatrized, but Athos, by dint of conversing\r\nwith his son and mixing a little more of his life with that of the young\r\nman, had brought him to understand that this pang of a first infidelity\r\nis necessary to every human existence; and that no one has loved without\r\nencountering it. Raoul listened, again and again, but never understood.\r\nNothing replaces in the deeply afflicted heart the remembrance and\r\nthought of the beloved object. Raoul then replied to the reasoning of\r\nhis father:\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, all that you tell me is true; I believe that no one has\r\nsuffered in the affections of the heart so much as you have; but you\r\nare a man too great by reason of intelligence, and too severely tried by\r\nadverse fortune not to allow for the weakness of the soldier who suffers\r\nfor the first time. I am paying a tribute that will not be paid a second\r\ntime; permit me to plunge myself so deeply in my grief that I may forget\r\nmyself in it, that I may drown even my reason in it.”\r\n\r\n“Raoul! Raoul!”\r\n\r\n“Listen, monsieur. Never shall I accustom myself to the idea that\r\nLouise, the chastest and most innocent of women, has been able to so\r\nbasely deceive a man so honest and so true a lover as myself. Never can\r\nI persuade myself that I see that sweet and noble mask change into\r\na hypocritical lascivious face. Louise lost! Louise infamous!\r\nAh! monseigneur, that idea is much more cruel to me than Raoul\r\nabandoned--Raoul unhappy!”\r\n\r\nAthos then employed the heroic remedy. He defended Louise against Raoul,\r\nand justified her perfidy by her love. “A woman who would have yielded\r\nto a king because he is a king,” said he, “would deserve to be styled\r\ninfamous; but Louise loves Louis. Young, both, they have forgotten, he\r\nhis rank, she her vows. Love absolves everything, Raoul. The two young\r\npeople love each other with sincerity.”\r\n\r\nAnd when he had dealt this severe poniard-thrust, Athos, with a sigh,\r\nsaw Raoul bound away beneath the rankling wound, and fly to the thickest\r\nrecesses of the wood, or the solitude of his chamber, whence, an hour\r\nafter, he would return, pale, trembling, but subdued. Then, coming up\r\nto Athos with a smile, he would kiss his hand, like the dog who, having\r\nbeen beaten, caresses a respected master, to redeem his fault. Raoul\r\nredeemed nothing but his weakness, and only confessed his grief. Thus\r\npassed away the days that followed that scene in which Athos had\r\nso violently shaken the indomitable pride of the king. Never, when\r\nconversing with his son, did he make any allusion to that scene; never\r\ndid he give him the details of that vigorous lecture, which might,\r\nperhaps, have consoled the young man, by showing him his rival humbled.\r\nAthos did not wish that the offended lover should forget the respect due\r\nto his king. And when Bragelonne, ardent, angry, and melancholy, spoke\r\nwith contempt of royal words, of the equivocal faith which certain\r\nmadmen draw from promises that emanate from thrones, when, passing over\r\ntwo centuries, with that rapidity of a bird that traverses a narrow\r\nstrait to go from one continent to the other, Raoul ventured to predict\r\nthe time in which kings would be esteemed as less than other men, Athos\r\nsaid to him, in his serene, persuasive voice, “You are right, Raoul;\r\nall that you say will happen; kings will lose their privileges, as\r\nstars which have survived their aeons lose their splendor. But when that\r\nmoment comes, Raoul, we shall be dead. And remember well what I say\r\nto you. In this world, all, men, women, and kings, must live for the\r\npresent. We can only live for the future for God.”\r\n\r\nThis was the manner in which Athos and Raoul were, as usual, conversing,\r\nand walking backwards and forwards in the long alley of limes in the\r\npark, when the bell which served to announce to the comte either the\r\nhour of dinner or the arrival of a visitor, was rung; and, without\r\nattaching any importance to it, he turned towards the house with his\r\nson; and at the end of the alley they found themselves in the presence\r\nof Aramis and Porthos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVI. The Last Adieux.\r\n\r\nRaoul uttered a cry, and affectionately embraced Porthos. Aramis and\r\nAthos embraced like old men; and this embrace itself being a question\r\nfor Aramis, he immediately said, “My friend, we have not long to remain\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the comte.\r\n\r\n“Only time to tell you of my good fortune,” interrupted Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Raoul.\r\n\r\nAthos looked silently at Aramis, whose somber air had already appeared\r\nto him very little in harmony with the good news Porthos hinted.\r\n\r\n“What is the good fortune that has happened to you? Let us hear it,”\r\n said Raoul, with a smile.\r\n\r\n“The king has made me a duke,” said the worthy Porthos, with an air of\r\nmystery, in the ear of the young man, “a duke by _brevet_.”\r\n\r\nBut the _asides_ of Porthos were always loud enough to be heard by\r\neverybody. His murmurs were in the diapason of ordinary roaring. Athos\r\nheard him, and uttered an exclamation which made Aramis start. The\r\nlatter took Athos by the arm, and, after having asked Porthos’s\r\npermission to say a word to his friend in private, “My dear Athos,” he\r\nbegan, “you see me overwhelmed with grief and trouble.”\r\n\r\n“With grief and trouble, my dear friend?” cried the comte; “oh, what?”\r\n\r\n“In two words. I have conspired against the king; that conspiracy has\r\nfailed, and, at this moment, I am doubtless pursued.”\r\n\r\n“You are pursued!--a conspiracy! Eh! my friend, what do you tell me?”\r\n\r\n“The saddest truth. I am entirely ruined.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but Porthos--this title of duke--what does all that mean?”\r\n\r\n“That is the subject of my severest pain; that is the deepest of my\r\nwounds. I have, believing in infallible success, drawn Porthos into my\r\nconspiracy. He threw himself into it, as you know he would do, with all\r\nhis strength, without knowing what he was about; and now he is as much\r\ncompromised as myself--as completely ruined as I am.”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” And Athos turned towards Porthos, who was smiling\r\ncomplacently.\r\n\r\n“I must make you acquainted with the whole. Listen to me,” continued\r\nAramis; and he related the history as we know it. Athos, during the\r\nrecital, several times felt the sweat break from his forehead. “It was a\r\ngreat idea,” said he, “but a great error.”\r\n\r\n“For which I am punished, Athos.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore, I will not tell you my entire thought.”\r\n\r\n“Tell it, nevertheless.”\r\n\r\n“It is a crime.”\r\n\r\n“A capital crime; I know it is. _Lese majeste_.”\r\n\r\n“Porthos! poor Porthos!”\r\n\r\n“What would you advise me to do? Success, as I have told you, was\r\ncertain.”\r\n\r\n“M. Fouquet is an honest man.”\r\n\r\n“And I a fool for having so ill-judged him,” said Aramis. “Oh, the\r\nwisdom of man! Oh, millstone that grinds the world! and which is one day\r\nstopped by a grain of sand which has fallen, no one knows how, between\r\nits wheels.”\r\n\r\n“Say by a diamond, Aramis. But the thing is done. How do you think of\r\nacting?”\r\n\r\n“I am taking away Porthos. The king will never believe that that worthy\r\nman has acted innocently. He never can believe that Porthos has thought\r\nhe was serving the king, whilst acting as he has done. His head would\r\npay my fault. It shall not, must not, be so.”\r\n\r\n“You are taking him away, whither?”\r\n\r\n“To Belle-Isle, at first. That is an impregnable place of refuge. Then,\r\nI have the sea, and a vessel to pass over into England, where I have\r\nmany relations.”\r\n\r\n“You? in England?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, or else in Spain, where I have still more.”\r\n\r\n“But, our excellent Porthos! you ruin him, for the king will confiscate\r\nall his property.”\r\n\r\n“All is provided for. I know how, when once in Spain, to reconcile\r\nmyself with Louis XIV., and restore Porthos to favor.”\r\n\r\n“You have credit, seemingly, Aramis!” said Athos, with a discreet air.\r\n\r\n“Much; and at the service of my friends.”\r\n\r\nThese words were accompanied by a warm pressure of the hand.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” replied the comte.\r\n\r\n“And while we are on this head,” said Aramis, “you also are a\r\nmalcontent; you also, Raoul, have griefs to lay to the king. Follow our\r\nexample; pass over into Belle-Isle. Then we shall see, I guarantee upon\r\nmy honor, that in a month there will be war between France and Spain on\r\nthe subject of this son of Louis XIII., who is an Infante likewise,\r\nand whom France detains inhumanly. Now, as Louis XIV. would have no\r\ninclination for a war on that subject, I will answer for an arrangement,\r\nthe result of which must bring greatness to Porthos and to me, and a\r\nduchy in France to you, who are already a grandee of Spain. Will you\r\njoin us?”\r\n\r\n“No; for my part I prefer having something to reproach the king with;\r\nit is a pride natural to my race to pretend to a superiority over royal\r\nraces. Doing what you propose, I should become the obliged of the king;\r\nI should certainly be the gainer on that ground, but I should be a loser\r\nin my conscience.--No, thank you!”\r\n\r\n“Then give me two things, Athos,--your absolution.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I give it you if you really wished to avenge the weak and oppressed\r\nagainst the oppressor.”\r\n\r\n“That is sufficient for me,” said Aramis, with a blush which was lost\r\nin the obscurity of the night. “And now, give me your two best horses\r\nto gain the second post, as I have been refused any under the pretext of\r\nthe Duc de Beaufort being traveling in this country.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have the two best horses, Aramis; and again I recommend poor\r\nPorthos strongly to your care.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I have no fear on that score. One word more: do you think I am\r\nmaneuvering for him as I ought?”\r\n\r\n“The evil being committed, yes; for the king would not pardon him, and\r\nyou have, whatever may be said, always a supporter in M. Fouquet, who\r\nwill not abandon you, he being himself compromised, notwithstanding his\r\nheroic action.”\r\n\r\n“You are right. And that is why, instead of gaining the sea at once,\r\nwhich would proclaim my fear and guilt, that is why I remain upon French\r\nground. But Belle-Isle will be for me whatever ground I wish it to be,\r\nEnglish, Spanish, or Roman; all will depend, with me, on the standard I\r\nshall think proper to unfurl.”\r\n\r\n“How so?”\r\n\r\n“It was I who fortified Belle-Isle; and, so long as I defend it, nobody\r\ncan take Belle-Isle from me. And then, as you have said just now, M.\r\nFouquet is there. Belle-Isle will not be attacked without the signature\r\nof M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\n“That is true. Nevertheless, be prudent. The king is both cunning and\r\nstrong.” Aramis smiled.\r\n\r\n“I again recommend Porthos to you,” repeated the count, with a sort of\r\ncold persistence.\r\n\r\n“Whatever becomes of me, count,” replied Aramis, in the same tone, “our\r\nbrother Porthos will fare as I do--or _better_.”\r\n\r\nAthos bowed whilst pressing the hand of Aramis, and turned to embrace\r\nPorthos with emotion.\r\n\r\n“I was born lucky, was I not?” murmured the latter, transported with\r\nhappiness, as he folded his cloak round him.\r\n\r\n“Come, my dear friend,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\nRaoul had gone out to give orders for the saddling of the horses. The\r\ngroup was already divided. Athos saw his two friends on the point of\r\ndeparture, and something like a mist passed before his eyes and weighed\r\nupon his heart.\r\n\r\n“It is strange,” thought he, “whence comes the inclination I feel to\r\nembrace Porthos once more?” At that moment Porthos turned round, and\r\nhe came towards his old friend with open arms. This last endearment was\r\ntender as in youth, as in times when hearts were warm--life happy. And\r\nthen Porthos mounted his horse. Aramis came back once more to throw\r\nhis arms round the neck of Athos. The latter watched them along the\r\nhigh-road, elongated by the shade, in their white cloaks. Like phantoms\r\nthey seemed to enlarge on their departure from the earth, and it was not\r\nin the mist, but in the declivity of the ground that they disappeared.\r\nAt the end of the perspective, both seemed to have given a spring with\r\ntheir feet, which made them vanish as if evaporated into cloud-land.\r\n\r\nThen Athos, with a very heavy heart, returned towards the house, saying\r\nto Bragelonne, “Raoul, I don’t know what it is that has just told me\r\nthat I have seen those two for the last time.”\r\n\r\n“It does not astonish me, monsieur, that you should have such a\r\nthought,” replied the young man, “for I have at this moment the same,\r\nand think also that I shall never see Messieurs du Vallon and d’Herblay\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you,” replied the count, “you speak like a man rendered sad by a\r\ndifferent cause; you see everything in black; you are young, and if you\r\nchance never to see those old friends again, it will because they no\r\nlonger exist in the world in which you have yet many years to pass. But\r\nI--”\r\n\r\nRaoul shook his head sadly, and leaned upon the shoulder of the count,\r\nwithout either of them finding another word in their hearts, which were\r\nready to overflow.\r\n\r\nAll at once a noise of horses and voices, from the extremity of the road\r\nto Blois, attracted their attention that way. Flambeaux-bearers shook\r\ntheir torches merrily among the trees of their route, and turned round,\r\nfrom time to time, to avoid distancing the horsemen who followed them.\r\nThese flames, this noise, this dust of a dozen richly caparisoned\r\nhorses, formed a strange contrast in the middle of the night with the\r\nmelancholy and almost funereal disappearance of the two shadows of\r\nAramis and Porthos. Athos went towards the house; but he had hardly\r\nreached the parterre, when the entrance gate appeared in a blaze; all\r\nthe flambeaux stopped and appeared to enflame the road. A cry was heard\r\nof “M. le Duc de Beaufort”--and Athos sprang towards the door of his\r\nhouse. But the duke had already alighted from his horse, and was looking\r\naround him.\r\n\r\n“I am here, monseigneur,” said Athos.\r\n\r\n“Ah! good evening, dear count,” said the prince, with that frank\r\ncordiality which won him so many hearts. “Is it too late for a friend?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! my dear prince, come in!” said the count.\r\n\r\nAnd, M. de Beaufort leaning on the arm of Athos, they entered the\r\nhouse, followed by Raoul, who walked respectfully and modestly among the\r\nofficers of the prince, with several of whom he was acquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII. Monsieur de Beaufort.\r\n\r\nThe prince turned round at the moment when Raoul, in order to leave him\r\nalone with Athos, was shutting the door, and preparing to go with the\r\nother officers into an adjoining apartment.\r\n\r\n“Is that the young man I have heard M. le Prince speak so highly of?”\r\n asked M. de Beaufort.\r\n\r\n“It is, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“He is quite the soldier; let him stay, count, we cannot spare him.”\r\n\r\n“Remain, Raoul, since monseigneur permits it,” said Athos.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ he is tall and handsome!” continued the duke. “Will you give\r\nhim to me, monseigneur, if I ask him of you?”\r\n\r\n“How am I to understand you, monseigneur?” said Athos.\r\n\r\n“Why, I call upon you to bid you farewell.”\r\n\r\n“Farewell!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in good truth. Have you no idea of what I am about to become?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I suppose, what you have always been, monseigneur,--a valiant\r\nprince, and an excellent gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to become an African prince,--a Bedouin gentleman. The king\r\nis sending me to make conquests among the Arabs.”\r\n\r\n“What is this you tell me, monseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“Strange, is it not? I, the Parisian _par essence_, I who have reigned\r\nin the faubourgs, and have been called King of the Halles,--I am going\r\nto pass from the Place Maubert to the minarets of Gigelli; from a\r\nFrondeur I am becoming an adventurer!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, monseigneur, if you did not yourself tell me that--”\r\n\r\n“It would not be credible, would it? Believe me, nevertheless, and we\r\nhave but to bid each other farewell. This is what comes of getting into\r\nfavor again.”\r\n\r\n“Into favor?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You smile. Ah, my dear count, do you know why I have accepted this\r\nenterprise, can you guess?”\r\n\r\n“Because your highness loves glory above--everything.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no; there is no glory in firing muskets at savages. I see no glory\r\nin that, for my part, and it is more probable that I shall there meet\r\nwith something else. But I have wished, and still wish earnestly, my\r\ndear count, that my life should have that last _facet_, after all the\r\nwhimsical exhibitions I have seen myself make during fifty years. For,\r\nin short, you must admit that it is sufficiently strange to be born\r\nthe grandson of a king, to have made war against kings, to have been\r\nreckoned among the powers of the age, to have maintained my rank, to\r\nfeel Henry IV. within me, to be great admiral of France--and then to go\r\nand get killed at Gigelli, among all those Turks, Saracens, and Moors.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, you harp with strange persistence on that theme,” said\r\nAthos, in an agitated voice. “How can you suppose that so brilliant a\r\ndestiny will be extinguished in that remote and miserable scene?”\r\n\r\n“And can you believe, upright and simple as you are, that if I go into\r\nAfrica for this ridiculous motive, I will not endeavor to come out of it\r\nwithout ridicule? Shall I not give the world cause to speak of me? And\r\nto be spoken of, nowadays, when there are Monsieur le Prince, M. de\r\nTurenne, and many others, my contemporaries, I, admiral of France,\r\ngrandson of Henry IV., king of Paris, have I anything left but to get\r\nmyself killed? _Cordieu!_ I will be talked of, I tell you; I shall be\r\nkilled whether or not; if not there, somewhere else.”\r\n\r\n“Why, monseigneur, this is mere exaggeration; and hitherto you have\r\nshown nothing exaggerated save in bravery.”\r\n\r\n“_Peste!_ my dear friend, there is bravery in facing scurvy, dysentery,\r\nlocusts, poisoned arrows, as my ancestor St. Louis did. Do you know\r\nthose fellows still use poisoned arrows? And then, you know me of old,\r\nI fancy, and you know that when I once make up my mind to a thing, I\r\nperform it in grim earnest.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you made up your mind to escape from Vincennes.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, but you aided me in that, my master; and, _a propos_, I turn this\r\nway and that, without seeing my old friend, M. Vaugrimaud. How is he?”\r\n\r\n“M. Vaugrimaud is still your highness’s most respectful servant,” said\r\nAthos, smiling.\r\n\r\n“I have a hundred pistoles here for him, which I bring as a legacy. My\r\nwill is made, count.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! monseigneur! monseigneur!”\r\n\r\n“And you may understand that if Grimaud’s name were to appear in my\r\nwill--” The duke began to laugh; then addressing Raoul, who, from the\r\ncommencement of this conversation, had sunk into a profound reverie,\r\n“Young man,” said he, “I know there is to be found here a certain De\r\nVouvray wine, and I believe--” Raoul left the room precipitately to\r\norder the wine. In the meantime M. de Beaufort took the hand of Athos.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean to do with him?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“Nothing at present, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes, I know; since the passion of the king for La Vallière.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“That is all true, then, is it? I think I know her, that little La\r\nVallière. She is not particularly handsome, if I remember right?”\r\n\r\n“No, monseigneur,” said Athos.\r\n\r\n“Do you know whom she reminds me of?”\r\n\r\n“Does she remind your highness of any one?”\r\n\r\n“She reminds me of a very agreeable girl, whose mother lived in the\r\nHalles.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! ah!” said Athos, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Oh! the good old times,” added M. de Beaufort. “Yes, La Vallière\r\nreminds me of that girl.”\r\n\r\n“Who had a son, had she not?” [3]\r\n\r\n“I believe she had,” replied the duke, with careless _naivete_ and a\r\ncomplaisant forgetfulness, of which no words could translate the tone\r\nand the vocal expression. “Now, here is poor Raoul, who is your son, I\r\nbelieve.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is my son, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“And the poor lad has been cut out by the king, and he frets.”\r\n\r\n“Still better, monseigneur, he abstains.”\r\n\r\n“You are going to let the boy rust in idleness; it is a mistake. Come,\r\ngive him to me.”\r\n\r\n“My wish is to keep him at home, monseigneur. I have no longer anything\r\nin the world but him, and as long as he likes to remain--”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” replied the duke. “I could, nevertheless, have soon put\r\nmatters to rights again. I assure you, I think he has in him the\r\nstuff of which marechals of France are made; I have seen more than one\r\nproduced from less likely rough material.”\r\n\r\n“That is very possible, monseigneur; but it is the king who makes\r\nmarechals of France, and Raoul will never accept anything of the king.”\r\n\r\nRaoul interrupted this conversation by his return. He preceded Grimaud,\r\nwhose still steady hands carried the plateau with one glass and a bottle\r\nof the duke’s favorite wine. On seeing his old _protege_, the duke\r\nuttered an exclamation of pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Grimaud! Good evening, Grimaud!” said he; “how goes it?”\r\n\r\nThe servant bowed profoundly, as much gratified as his noble\r\ninterlocutor.\r\n\r\n“Two old friends!” said the duke, shaking honest Grimaud’s shoulder\r\nafter a vigorous fashion; which was followed by another still more\r\nprofound and delighted bow from Grimaud.\r\n\r\n“But what is this, count, only one glass?”\r\n\r\n“I should not think of drinking with your highness, unless your highness\r\npermitted me,” replied Athos, with noble humility.\r\n\r\n“_Cordieu!_ you were right to bring only one glass, we will both drink\r\nout of it, like two brothers in arms. Begin, count.”\r\n\r\n“Do me the honor,” said Athos, gently putting back the glass.\r\n\r\n“You are a charming friend,” replied the Duc de Beaufort, who drank, and\r\npassed the goblet to his companion. “But that is not all,” continued he,\r\n“I am still thirsty, and I wish to do honor to this handsome young man\r\nwho stands here. I carry good luck with me, vicomte,” said he to Raoul;\r\n“wish for something while drinking out of my glass, and may the black\r\nplague grab me if what you wish does not come to pass!” He held the\r\ngoblet to Raoul, who hastily moistened his lips, and replied with the\r\nsame promptitude:\r\n\r\n“I have wished for something, monseigneur.” His eyes sparkled with a\r\ngloomy fire, and the blood mounted to his cheeks; he terrified Athos, if\r\nonly with his smile.\r\n\r\n“And what have you wished for?” replied the duke, sinking back into his\r\nfauteuil, whilst with one hand he returned the bottle to Grimaud, and\r\nwith the other gave him a purse.\r\n\r\n“Will you promise me, monseigneur, to grant me what I wish for?”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ That is agreed upon.”\r\n\r\n“I wished, monsieur le duc, to go with you to Gigelli.”\r\n\r\nAthos became pale, and was unable to conceal his agitation. The duke\r\nlooked at his friend, as if desirous to assist him to parry this\r\nunexpected blow.\r\n\r\n“That is difficult, my dear vicomte, very difficult,” added he, in a\r\nlower tone of voice.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, monseigneur, I have been indiscreet,” replied Raoul, in a\r\nfirm voice; “but as you yourself invited me to wish--”\r\n\r\n“To wish to leave me?” said Athos.\r\n\r\n“Oh! monsieur--can you imagine--”\r\n\r\n“Well, _mordieu!_” cried the duke, “the young vicomte is right! What can\r\nhe do here? He will go moldy with grief.”\r\n\r\nRaoul blushed, and the excitable prince continued: “War is a\r\ndistraction: we gain everything by it; we can only lose one thing by\r\nit--life--then so much the worse!”\r\n\r\n“That is to say, memory,” said Raoul, eagerly; “and that is to say, so\r\nmuch the better!”\r\n\r\nHe repented of having spoken so warmly when he saw Athos rise and open\r\nthe window; which was, doubtless, to conceal his emotion. Raoul sprang\r\ntowards the comte, but the latter had already overcome his emotion, and\r\nturned to the lights with a serene and impassible countenance. “Well,\r\ncome,” said the duke, “let us see! Shall he go, or shall he not? If he\r\ngoes, comte, he shall be my aide-de-camp, my son.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur!” cried Raoul, bending his knee.\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur!” cried Athos, taking the hand of the duke; “Raoul shall do\r\njust as he likes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no, monsieur, just as you like,” interrupted the young man.\r\n\r\n“_Par la corbleu!_” said the prince in his turn, “it is neither the\r\ncomte nor the vicomte that shall have his way, it is I. I will take him\r\naway. The marine offers a superb fortune, my friend.”\r\n\r\nRaoul smiled again so sadly, that this time Athos felt his heart\r\npenetrated by it, and replied to him by a severe look. Raoul\r\ncomprehended it all; he recovered his calmness, and was so guarded, that\r\nnot another word escaped him. The duke at length rose, on observing the\r\nadvanced hour, and said, with animation, “I am in great haste, but if I\r\nam told I have lost time in talking with a friend, I will reply I have\r\ngained--on the balance--a most excellent recruit.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, monsieur le duc,” interrupted Raoul, “do not tell the king\r\nso, for it is not the king I wish to serve.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! my friend, whom, then, will you serve? The times are past when\r\nyou might have said, ‘I belong to M. de Beaufort.’ No, nowadays, we all\r\nbelong to the king, great or small. Therefore, if you serve on board my\r\nvessels, there can be nothing equivocal about it, my dear vicomte; it\r\nwill be the king you will serve.”\r\n\r\nAthos waited with a kind of impatient joy for the reply about to be made\r\nto this embarrassing question by Raoul, the intractable enemy of the\r\nking, his rival. The father hoped that the obstacle would overcome the\r\ndesire. He was thankful to M. de Beaufort, whose lightness or generous\r\nreflection had thrown an impediment in the way of the departure of a\r\nson, now his only joy. But Raoul, still firm and tranquil, replied:\r\n“Monsieur le duc, the objection you make I have already considered in my\r\nmind. I will serve on board your vessels, because you do me the honor\r\nto take me with you; but I shall there serve a more powerful master than\r\nthe king: I shall serve God!”\r\n\r\n“God! how so?” said the duke and Athos together.\r\n\r\n“My intention is to make profession, and become a knight of Malta,”\r\n added Bragelonne, letting fall, one by one, words more icy than the\r\ndrops which fall from the bare trees after the tempests of winter. [4]\r\n\r\nUnder this blow Athos staggered and the prince himself was moved.\r\nGrimaud uttered a heavy groan, and let fall the bottle, which was broken\r\nwithout anybody paying attention. M. de Beaufort looked the young man in\r\nthe face, and read plainly, though his eyes were cast down, the fire of\r\nresolution before which everything must give way. As to Athos, he was\r\ntoo well acquainted with that tender, but inflexible soul; he could not\r\nhope to make it deviate from the fatal road it had just chosen. He could\r\nonly press the hand the duke held out to him. “Comte, I shall set off in\r\ntwo days for Toulon,” said M. de Beaufort. “Will you meet me at Paris,\r\nin order that I may know your determination?”\r\n\r\n“I will have the honor of thanking you there, _mon prince_, for all your\r\nkindness,” replied the comte.\r\n\r\n“And be sure to bring the vicomte with you, whether he follows me or\r\ndoes not follow me,” added the duke; “he has my word, and I only ask\r\nyours.”\r\n\r\nHaving thrown a little balm upon the wound of the paternal heart, he\r\npulled the ear of Grimaud, whose eyes sparkled more than usual, and\r\nregained his escort in the parterre. The horses, rested and refreshed,\r\nset off with spirit through the lovely night, and soon placed a\r\nconsiderable distance between their master and the chateau.\r\n\r\nAthos and Bragelonne were again face to face. Eleven o’clock was\r\nstriking. The father and son preserved a profound silence towards each\r\nother, where an intelligent observer would have expected cries and\r\ntears. But these two men were of such a nature that all emotion\r\nfollowing their final resolutions plunged itself so deep into their\r\nhearts that it was lost forever. They passed, then, silently and almost\r\nbreathlessly, the hour that preceded midnight. The clock, by striking,\r\nalone pointed out to them how many minutes had lasted the painful\r\njourney made by their souls in the immensity of their remembrances of\r\nthe past and fear of the future. Athos rose first, saying, “it is late,\r\nthen.... Till to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nRaoul rose, and in his turn embraced his father. The latter held him\r\nclasped to his breast, and said, in a tremulous voice, “In two days, you\r\nwill have left me, my son--left me forever, Raoul!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied the young man, “I had formed a determination, that\r\nof piercing my heart with my sword; but you would have thought that\r\ncowardly. I have renounced that determination, and _therefore_ we must\r\npart.”\r\n\r\n“You leave me desolate by going, Raoul.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me again, monsieur, I implore you. If I do not go, I shall\r\ndie here of grief and love. I know how long a time I have to live thus.\r\nSend me away quickly, monsieur, or you will see me basely die before\r\nyour eyes--in your house--this is stronger than my will--stronger than\r\nmy strength--you may plainly see that within one month I have lived\r\nthirty years, and that I approach the end of my life.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Athos, coldly, “you go with the intention of getting killed\r\nin Africa? Oh, tell me! do not lie!”\r\n\r\nRaoul grew deadly pale, and remained silent for two seconds, which were\r\nto his father two hours of agony. Then, all at once: “Monsieur,” said\r\nhe, “I have promised to devote myself to God. In exchange for the\r\nsacrifice I make of my youth and liberty, I will only ask of Him one\r\nthing, and that is, to preserve me for you, because you are the only tie\r\nwhich attaches me to this world. God alone can give me the strength not\r\nto forget that I owe you everything, and that nothing ought to stand in\r\nmy esteem before you.”\r\n\r\nAthos embraced his son tenderly, and said:\r\n\r\n“You have just replied to me on the word of honor of an honest man; in\r\ntwo days we shall be with M. de Beaufort at Paris, and you will then do\r\nwhat will be proper for you to do. You are free, Raoul; adieu.”\r\n\r\nAnd he slowly gained his bedroom. Raoul went down into the garden, and\r\npassed the night in the alley of limes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXVIII. Preparations for Departure.\r\n\r\nAthos lost no more time in combating this immutable resolution. He gave\r\nall his attention to preparing, during the two days the duke had granted\r\nhim, the proper appointments for Raoul. This labor chiefly concerned\r\nGrimaud, who immediately applied himself to it with the good-will and\r\nintelligence we know he possessed. Athos gave this worthy servant orders\r\nto take the route to Paris when the equipments should be ready; and, not\r\nto expose himself to the danger of keeping the duke waiting, or delaying\r\nRaoul, so that the duke should perceive his absence, he himself, the day\r\nafter the visit of M. de Beaufort, set off for Paris with his son.\r\n\r\nFor the poor young man it was an emotion easily to be understood, thus\r\nto return to Paris amongst all the people who had known and loved him.\r\nEvery face recalled a pang to him who had suffered so much; to him who\r\nhad loved so much, some circumstance of his unhappy love. Raoul, on\r\napproaching Paris, felt as if he were dying. Once in Paris, he really\r\nexisted no longer. When he reached Guiche’s residence, he was informed\r\nthat Guiche was with Monsieur. Raoul took the road to the Luxembourg,\r\nand when arrived, without suspecting that he was going to the place\r\nwhere La Vallière had lived, he heard so much music and respired so\r\nmany perfumes, he heard so much joyous laughter, and saw so many dancing\r\nshadows, that if it had not been for a charitable woman, who perceived\r\nhim so dejected and pale beneath a doorway, he would have remained there\r\na few minutes, and then would have gone away, never to return. But, as\r\nwe have said, in the first ante-chamber he had stopped, solely for the\r\nsake of not mixing himself with all those happy beings he felt were\r\nmoving around him in the adjacent salons. And as one of Monsieur’s\r\nservants, recognizing him, had asked him if he wished to see Monsieur or\r\nMadame, Raoul had scarcely answered him, but had sunk down upon a bench\r\nnear the velvet doorway, looking at a clock, which had stopped\r\nfor nearly an hour. The servant had passed on, and another, better\r\nacquainted with him, had come up, and interrogated Raoul whether he\r\nshould inform M. de Guiche of his being there. This name did not even\r\narouse the recollections of Raoul. The persistent servant went on to\r\nrelate that De Guiche had just invented a new game of lottery, and\r\nwas teaching it to the ladies. Raoul, opening his large eyes, like the\r\nabsent man in Theophrastus, made no answer, but his sadness increased\r\ntwo shades. With his head hanging down, his limbs relaxed, his mouth\r\nhalf open for the escape of his sighs, Raoul remained, thus forgotten,\r\nin the ante-chamber, when all at once a lady’s robe passed, rubbing\r\nagainst the doors of a side salon, which opened on the gallery. A lady,\r\nyoung, pretty, and gay, scolding an officer of the household, entered by\r\nthat way, and expressed herself with much vivacity. The officer replied\r\nin calm but firm sentences; it was rather a little love pet than a\r\nquarrel of courtiers, and was terminated by a kiss on the fingers of the\r\nlady. Suddenly, on perceiving Raoul, the lady became silent, and pushing\r\naway the officer:\r\n\r\n“Make your escape, Malicorne,” said she; “I did not think there was any\r\none here. I shall curse you, if they have either heard or seen us!”\r\n\r\nMalicorne hastened away. The young lady advanced behind Raoul, and\r\nstretching her joyous face over him as he lay:\r\n\r\n“Monsieur is a gallant man,” said she, “and no doubt--”\r\n\r\nShe here interrupted herself by uttering a cry. “Raoul!” said she,\r\nblushing.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle de Montalais!” said Raoul, paler than death.\r\n\r\nHe rose unsteadily, and tried to make his way across the slippery mosaic\r\nof the floor; but she had comprehended that savage and cruel grief; she\r\nfelt that in the flight of Raoul there was an accusation of herself. A\r\nwoman, ever vigilant, she did not think she ought to let the opportunity\r\nslip of making good her justification; but Raoul, though stopped by her\r\nin the middle of the gallery, did not seem disposed to surrender without\r\na combat. He took it up in a tone so cold and embarrassed, that if they\r\nhad been thus surprised, the whole court would have no doubt about the\r\nproceedings of Mademoiselle de Montalais.\r\n\r\n“Ah! monsieur,” said she with disdain, “what you are doing is very\r\nunworthy of a gentleman. My heart inclines me to speak to you; you\r\ncompromise me by a reception almost uncivil; you are wrong, monsieur;\r\nand you confound your friends with enemies. Farewell!”\r\n\r\nRaoul had sworn never to speak of Louise, never even to look at those\r\nwho might have seen Louise; he was going into another world, that he\r\nmight never meet with anything Louise had seen, or even touched. But\r\nafter the first shock of his pride, after having had a glimpse of\r\nMontalais, the companion of Louise--Montalais, who reminded him of the\r\nturret of Blois and the joys of youth--all his reason faded away.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, mademoiselle; it enters not, it cannot enter into my\r\nthoughts to be uncivil.”\r\n\r\n“Do you wish to speak to me?” said she, with the smile of former days.\r\n“Well! come somewhere else; for we may be surprised.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said he.\r\n\r\nShe looked at the clock, doubtingly, then, having reflected:\r\n\r\n“In my apartment,” said she, “we shall have an hour to ourselves.” And\r\ntaking her course, lighter than a fairy, she ran up to her chamber,\r\nfollowed by Raoul. Shutting the door, and placing in the hands of her\r\n_cameriste_ the mantle she had held upon her arm:\r\n\r\n“You were seeking M. de Guiche, were you not?” said she to Raoul.\r\n\r\n“Yes, mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“I will go and ask him to come up here, presently, after I have spoken\r\nto you.”\r\n\r\n“Do so, mademoiselle.”\r\n\r\n“Are you angry with me?”\r\n\r\nRaoul looked at her for a moment, then, casting down his eyes, “Yes,”\r\n said he.\r\n\r\n“You think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture,\r\ndo you not?”\r\n\r\n“Rupture!” said he, with bitterness. “Oh! mademoiselle, there can be no\r\nrupture where there has been no love.”\r\n\r\n“You are in error,” replied Montalais; “Louise did love you.”\r\n\r\nRaoul started.\r\n\r\n“Not with love, I know; but she liked you, and you ought to have married\r\nher before you set out for London.”\r\n\r\nRaoul broke into a sinister laugh, which made Montalais shudder.\r\n\r\n“You tell me that very much at your ease, mademoiselle. Do people marry\r\nwhom they like? You forget that the king then kept for himself as his\r\nmistress her of whom we are speaking.”\r\n\r\n“Listen,” said the young woman, pressing the hands of Raoul in her own,\r\n“you were wrong in every way; a man of your age ought never to leave a\r\nwoman of hers alone.”\r\n\r\n“There is no longer any faith in the world, then,” said Raoul.\r\n\r\n“No, vicomte,” said Montalais, quietly. “Nevertheless, let me tell you\r\nthat, if, instead of loving Louise coldly and philosophically, you had\r\nendeavored to awaken her to love--”\r\n\r\n“Enough, I pray you, mademoiselle,” said Raoul. “I feel as though you\r\nare all, of both sexes, of a different age from me. You can laugh, and\r\nyou can banter agreeably. I, mademoiselle, I loved Mademoiselle de--”\r\n Raoul could not pronounce her name,--“I loved her well! I put my faith\r\nin her--now I am quits by loving her no longer.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, vicomte!” said Montalais, pointing to his reflection in a\r\nlooking-glass.\r\n\r\n“I know what you mean, mademoiselle; I am much altered, am I not? Well!\r\nDo you know why? Because my face is the mirror of my heart, the outer\r\nsurface changed to match the mind within.”\r\n\r\n“You are consoled, then?” said Montalais, sharply.\r\n\r\n“No, I shall never be consoled.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t understand you, M. de Bragelonne.”\r\n\r\n“I care but little for that. I do not quite understand myself.”\r\n\r\n“You have not even tried to speak to Louise?”\r\n\r\n“Who! I?” exclaimed the young man, with eyes flashing fire; “I!--Why do\r\nyou not advise me to marry her? Perhaps the king would consent now.” And\r\nhe rose from his chair full of anger.\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Montalais, “that you are not cured, and that Louise has\r\none enemy the more.”\r\n\r\n“One enemy the more!”\r\n\r\n“Yes; favorites are but little beloved at the court of France.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! while she has her lover to protect her, is not that enough? She\r\nhas chosen him of such a quality that her enemies cannot prevail against\r\nher.” But, stopping all at once, “And then she has you for a friend,\r\nmademoiselle,” added he, with a shade of irony which did not glide off\r\nthe cuirass.\r\n\r\n“Who! I?--Oh, no! I am no longer one of those whom Mademoiselle de la\r\nVallière condescends to look upon; but--”\r\n\r\nThis _but_, so big with menace and with storm; this _but_, which made\r\nthe heart of Raoul beat, such griefs did it presage for her whom lately\r\nhe loved so dearly; this terrible _but_, so significant in a woman\r\nlike Montalais, was interrupted by a moderately loud noise heard by the\r\nspeakers proceeding from the alcove behind the wainscoting. Montalais\r\nturned to listen, and Raoul was already rising, when a lady entered the\r\nroom quietly by the secret door, which she closed after her.\r\n\r\n“Madame!” exclaimed Raoul, on recognizing the sister-in-law of the king.\r\n\r\n“Stupid wretch!” murmured Montalais, throwing herself, but too late,\r\nbefore the princess, “I have been mistaken in an hour!” She had,\r\nhowever, time to warn the princess, who was walking towards Raoul.\r\n\r\n“M. de Bragelonne, Madame,” and at these words the princess drew back,\r\nuttering a cry in her turn.\r\n\r\n“Your royal highness,” said Montalais, with volubility, “is kind enough\r\nto think of this lottery, and--”\r\n\r\nThe princess began to lose countenance. Raoul hastened his departure,\r\nwithout divining all, but he felt that he was in the way. Madame was\r\npreparing a word of transition to recover herself, when a closet opened\r\nin front of the alcove, and M. de Guiche issued, all radiant, also from\r\nthat closet. The palest of the four, we must admit, was still Raoul. The\r\nprincess, however, was near fainting, and was obliged to lean upon the\r\nfoot of the bed for support. No one ventured to support her. This scene\r\noccupied several minutes of terrible suspense. But Raoul broke it.\r\nHe went up to the count, whose inexpressible emotion made his knees\r\ntremble, and taking his hand, “Dear count,” said he, “tell Madame I am\r\ntoo unhappy not to merit pardon; tell her also that I have loved in the\r\ncourse of my life, and that the horror of the treachery that has been\r\npracticed on me renders me inexorable towards all other treachery that\r\nmay be committed around me. This is why, mademoiselle,” said he, smiling\r\nto Montalais, “I never would divulge the secret of the visits of my\r\nfriend to your apartment. Obtain from Madame--from Madame, who is so\r\nclement and so generous,--obtain her pardon for you whom she has just\r\nsurprised also. You are both free, love each other, be happy!”\r\n\r\nThe princess felt for a moment a despair that cannot be described; it\r\nwas repugnant to her, notwithstanding the exquisite delicacy which Raoul\r\nhad exhibited, to feel herself at the mercy of one who had discovered\r\nsuch an indiscretion. It was equally repugnant to her to accept the\r\nevasion offered by this delicate deception. Agitated, nervous, she\r\nstruggled against the double stings of these two troubles. Raoul\r\ncomprehended her position, and came once more to her aid. Bending his\r\nknee before her: “Madame!” said he, in a low voice, “in two days I shall\r\nbe far from Paris; in a fortnight I shall be far from France, where I\r\nshall never be seen again.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going away, then?” said she, with great delight.\r\n\r\n“With M. de Beaufort.”\r\n\r\n“Into Africa!” cried De Guiche, in his turn. “You, Raoul--oh! my\r\nfriend--into Africa, where everybody dies!”\r\n\r\nAnd forgetting everything, forgetting that that forgetfulness itself\r\ncompromised the princess more eloquently than his presence, “Ingrate!”\r\n said he, “and you have not even consulted me!” And he embraced him;\r\nduring which time Montalais had led away Madame, and disappeared\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nRaoul passed his hand over his brow, and said, with a smile, “I have\r\nbeen dreaming!” Then warmly to Guiche, who by degrees absorbed him, “My\r\nfriend,” said he, “I conceal nothing from you, who are the elected of my\r\nheart. I am going to seek death in yonder country; your secret will not\r\nremain in my breast more than a year.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Raoul! a man!”\r\n\r\n“Do you know what is my thought, count? This is it--I shall live more\r\nvividly, being buried beneath the earth, than I have lived for this\r\nmonth past. We are Christians, my friend, and if such sufferings were to\r\ncontinue, I would not be answerable for the safety of my soul.”\r\n\r\nDe Guiche was anxious to raise objections.\r\n\r\n“Not one word more on my account,” said Raoul; “but advice to you, dear\r\nfriend; what I am going to say to you is of much greater importance.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Without doubt you risk much more than I do, because you love.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\n“It is a joy so sweet to me to be able to speak to you thus! Well, then,\r\nDe Guiche, beware of Montalais.”\r\n\r\n“What! of that kind friend?”\r\n\r\n“She was the friend of--her you know of. She ruined her by pride.”\r\n\r\n“You are mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“And now, when she has ruined her, she would ravish from her the only\r\nthing that renders that woman excusable in my eyes.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Her love.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by that?”\r\n\r\n“I mean that there is a plot formed against her who is the mistress of\r\nthe king--a plot formed in the very house of Madame.”\r\n\r\n“Can you think so?”\r\n\r\n“I am certain of it.”\r\n\r\n“By Montalais?”\r\n\r\n“Take her as the least dangerous of the enemies I dread for--the other!”\r\n\r\n“Explain yourself clearly, my friend; and if I can understand you--”\r\n\r\n“In two words. Madame has been long jealous of the king.”\r\n\r\n“I know she has--”\r\n\r\n“Oh! fear nothing--you are beloved--you are beloved, count; do you feel\r\nthe value of these three words? They signify that you can raise your\r\nhead, that you can sleep tranquilly, that you can thank God every\r\nminute of you life. You are beloved; that signifies that you may hear\r\neverything, even the counsel of a friend who wishes to preserve your\r\nhappiness. You are beloved, De Guiche, you are beloved! You do not\r\nendure those atrocious nights, those nights without end, which, with\r\narid eye and fainting heart, others pass through who are destined to\r\ndie. You will live long, if you act like the miser who, bit by bit,\r\ncrumb by crumb, collects and heaps up diamonds and gold. You are\r\nbeloved!--allow me to tell you what you must do that you may be beloved\r\nforever.”\r\n\r\nDe Guiche contemplated for some time this unfortunate young man, half\r\nmad with despair, till there passed through his heart something like\r\nremorse at his own happiness. Raoul suppressed his feverish excitement,\r\nto assume the voice and countenance of an impassible man.\r\n\r\n“They will make her, whose name I should wish still to be able to\r\npronounce--they will make her suffer. Swear to me that you will not\r\nsecond them in anything--but that you will defend her when possible, as\r\nI would have done myself.”\r\n\r\n“I swear I will,” replied De Guiche.\r\n\r\n“And,” continued Raoul, “some day, when you shall have rendered her\r\na great service--some day when she shall thank you, promise me to say\r\nthese words to her--‘I have done you this kindness, madame, at the warm\r\nrequest of M. de Bragelonne, whom you so deeply injured.’”\r\n\r\n“I swear I will,” murmured De Guiche.\r\n\r\n“That is all. Adieu! I set out to-morrow, or the day after, for\r\nToulon. If you have a few hours to spare, give them to me.”\r\n\r\n“All! all!” cried the young man.\r\n\r\n“Thank you!”\r\n\r\n“And what are you going to do now?”\r\n\r\n“I am going to meet M. le comte at Planchet’s residence, where we hope\r\nto find M. d’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“M. d’Artagnan?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I wish to embrace him before my departure. He is a brave man, who\r\nloves me dearly. Farewell, my friend; you are expected, no doubt; you\r\nwill find me, when you wish, at the lodgings of the comte. Farewell!”\r\n\r\nThe two young men embraced. Those who chanced to see them both thus,\r\nwould not have hesitated to say, pointing to Raoul, “That is the happy\r\nman!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX. Planchet’s Inventory.\r\n\r\nAthos, during the visit made to the Luxembourg by Raoul, had gone to\r\nPlanchet’s residence to inquire after D’Artagnan. The comte, on\r\narriving at the Rue des Lombards, found the shop of the grocer in great\r\nconfusion; but it was not the encumberment of a lucky sale, or that of\r\nan arrival of goods. Planchet was not enthroned, as usual, on sacks and\r\nbarrels. No. A young man with a pen behind his ear, and another with an\r\naccount-book in his hand, were setting down a number of figures, whilst\r\na third counted and weighed. An inventory was being taken. Athos,\r\nwho had no knowledge of commercial matters, felt himself a little\r\nembarrassed by material obstacles and the majesty of those who were thus\r\nemployed. He saw several customers sent away, and asked himself\r\nwhether he, who came to buy nothing, would not be more properly deemed\r\nimportunate. He therefore asked very politely if he could see M.\r\nPlanchet. The reply, quite carelessly given, was that M. Planchet was\r\npacking his trunks. These words surprised Athos. “What! his trunks?”\r\n said he; “is M. Planchet going away?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur, directly.”\r\n\r\n“Then, if you please, inform him that M. le Comte de la Fere desires to\r\nspeak to him for a moment.”\r\n\r\nAt the mention of the comte’s name, one of the young men, no doubt\r\naccustomed to hear it pronounced with respect, immediately went to\r\ninform Planchet. It was at this moment that Raoul, after his painful\r\nscene with Montalais and De Guiche, arrived at the grocer’s house.\r\nPlanchet left his job directly he received the comte’s message.\r\n\r\n“Ah! monsieur le comte!” exclaimed he, “how glad I am to see you! What\r\ngood star brings you here?”\r\n\r\n“My dear Planchet,” said Athos, pressing the hand of his son, whose sad\r\nlook he silently observed,--“we are come to learn of you--But in what\r\nconfusion do I find you! You are as white as a miller; where have you\r\nbeen rummaging?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, _diable!_ take care, monsieur; don’t come near me till I have well\r\nshaken myself.”\r\n\r\n“What for? Flour or dust only whiten.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; what you see on my arms is arsenic.”\r\n\r\n“Arsenic?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I am taking my precautions against rats.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, I suppose in an establishment like this, rats play a conspicuous\r\npart.”\r\n\r\n“It is not with this establishment I concern myself, monsieur le comte.\r\nThe rats have robbed me of more here than they will ever rob me of\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Why, you may have observed, monsieur, my inventory is being taken.”\r\n\r\n“Are you leaving trade, then?”\r\n\r\n“Eh! _mon Dieu!_ yes. I have disposed of my business to one of my young\r\nmen.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! you are rich, then, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, I have taken a dislike to the city; I don’t know whether it\r\nis because I am growing old, and as M. d’Artagnan one day said, when\r\nwe grow old we more often think of the adventures of our youth; but\r\nfor some time past I have felt myself attracted towards the country\r\nand gardening. I was a countryman formerly.” And Planchet marked this\r\nconfession with a rather pretentious laugh for a man making profession\r\nof humility.\r\n\r\nAthos made a gesture of approval, and then added: “You are going to buy\r\nan estate, then?”\r\n\r\n“I have bought one, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that is still better.”\r\n\r\n“A little house at Fontainebleau, with something like twenty acres of\r\nland round it.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Planchet! Accept my compliments on your acquisition.”\r\n\r\n“But, monsieur, we are not comfortable here; the cursed dust makes you\r\ncough. _Corbleu!_ I do not wish to poison the most worthy gentleman in\r\nthe kingdom.”\r\n\r\nAthos did not smile at this little pleasantry which Planchet had aimed\r\nat him, in order to try his strength in mundane facetiousness.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Athos, “let us have a little talk by ourselves--in your own\r\nroom, for example. You have a room, have you not?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, monsieur le comte.”\r\n\r\n“Upstairs, perhaps?” And Athos, seeing Planchet a little embarrassed,\r\nwished to relieve him by going first.\r\n\r\n“It is--but--” said Planchet, hesitating.\r\n\r\nAthos was mistaken in the cause of this hesitation, and, attributing it\r\nto a fear the grocer might have of offering humble hospitality, “Never\r\nmind, never mind,” said he, still going up, “the dwelling of a tradesman\r\nin this quarter is not expected to be a palace. Come on.”\r\n\r\nRaoul nimbly preceded him, and entered first. Two cries were heard\r\nsimultaneously--we may say three. One of these cries dominated the\r\nothers; it emanated from a woman. Another proceeded from the mouth of\r\nRaoul; it was an exclamation of surprise. He had no sooner uttered it\r\nthan he shut the door sharply. The third was from fright; it came from\r\nPlanchet.\r\n\r\n“I ask your pardon!” added he; “madame is dressing.”\r\n\r\nRaoul had, no doubt, seen that what Planchet said was true, for he\r\nturned round to go downstairs again.\r\n\r\n“Madame--” said Athos. “Oh! pardon me, Planchet, I did not know that you\r\nhad upstairs--”\r\n\r\n“It is Truchen,” added Planchet, blushing a little.\r\n\r\n“It is whoever you please, my good Planchet; but pardon my rudeness.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; go up now, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“We will do no such thing,” said Athos.\r\n\r\n“Oh! madame, having notice, has had time--”\r\n\r\n“No, Planchet; farewell!”\r\n\r\n“Eh, gentlemen! you would not disoblige me by thus standing on the\r\nstaircase, or by going away without having sat down.”\r\n\r\n“If we had known you had a lady upstairs,” replied Athos, with his\r\ncustomary coolness, “we would have asked permission to pay our respects\r\nto her.”\r\n\r\nPlanchet was so disconcerted by this little extravagance, that he forced\r\nthe passage, and himself opened the door to admit the comte and his son.\r\nTruchen was quite dressed: in the costume of the shopkeeper’s wife,\r\nrich yet coquettish; German eyes attacking French eyes. She left the\r\napartment after two courtesies, and went down into the shop--but not\r\nwithout having listened at the door, to know what Planchet’s gentlemen\r\nvisitors would say of her. Athos suspected that, and therefore turned\r\nthe conversation accordingly. Planchet, on his part, was burning to\r\ngive explanations, which Athos avoided. But, as certain tenacities are\r\nstronger than others, Athos was forced to hear Planchet recite his idyls\r\nof felicity, translated into a language more chaste than that of Longus.\r\nSo Planchet related how Truchen had charmed the years of his advancing\r\nage, and brought good luck to his business, as Ruth did to Boaz.\r\n\r\n“You want nothing now, then, but heirs to your property.”\r\n\r\n“If I had one he would have three hundred thousand livres,” said\r\nPlanchet.\r\n\r\n“Humph! you must have one, then,” said Athos, phlegmatically, “if only\r\nto prevent your little fortune being lost.”\r\n\r\nThis word _little fortune_ placed Planchet in his rank, like the voice\r\nof the sergeant when Planchet was but a _piqueur_ in the regiment of\r\nPiedmont, in which Rochefort had placed him. Athos perceived that the\r\ngrocer would marry Truchen, and, in spite of fate, establish a family.\r\nThis appeared the more evident to him when he learned that the young man\r\nto whom Planchet was selling the business was her cousin. Having heard\r\nall that was necessary of the happy prospects of the retiring grocer,\r\n“What is M. d’Artagnan about?” said he; “he is not at the Louvre.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! monsieur le comte, Monsieur d’Artagnan has disappeared.”\r\n\r\n“Disappeared!” said Athos, in surprise.\r\n\r\n“Oh! monsieur, we know what that means.”\r\n\r\n“But _I_ do not know.”\r\n\r\n“Whenever M. d’Artagnan disappears it is always for some mission or some\r\ngreat affair.”\r\n\r\n“Has he said anything to you about it?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“You were acquainted with his departure for England formerly, were you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“On account of the speculation.” said Planchet, heedlessly.\r\n\r\n“The speculation!”\r\n\r\n“I mean--” interrupted Planchet, quite confused.\r\n\r\n“Well, well; neither your affairs nor those of your master are in\r\nquestion; the interest we take in him alone has induced me to apply to\r\nyou. Since the captain of the musketeers is not here, and as we cannot\r\nlearn from you where we are likely to find M. d’Artagnan, we will take\r\nour leave of you. _Au revoir_, Planchet, _au revoir_. Let us be gone,\r\nRaoul.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le comte, I wish I were able to tell you--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, not at all; I am not the man to reproach a servant with\r\ndiscretion.”\r\n\r\nThis word “servant” struck rudely on the ears of the _demi-millionnaire_\r\nPlanchet, but natural respect and _bonhomie_ prevailed over pride.\r\n“There is nothing indiscreet in telling you, monsieur le comte, M.\r\nd’Artagnan came here the other day--”\r\n\r\n“Aha?”\r\n\r\n“And remained several hours consulting a geographical chart.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, then, my friend; say no more about it.”\r\n\r\n“And the chart is there as a proof,” added Planchet, who went to fetch\r\nfrom the neighboring wall, where it was suspended by a twist, forming a\r\ntriangle with the bar of the window to which it was fastened, the plan\r\nconsulted by the captain on his last visit to Planchet. This plan, which\r\nhe brought to the comte, was a map of France, upon which the practiced\r\neye of that gentleman discovered an itinerary, marked out with small\r\npins; wherever a pin was missing, a hole denoted its having been there.\r\nAthos, by following with his eye the pins and holes, saw that\r\nD’Artagnan had taken the direction of the south, and gone as far as the\r\nMediterranean, towards Toulon. It was near Cannes that the marks and\r\nthe punctured places ceased. The Comte de la Fere puzzled his brains for\r\nsome time, to divine what the musketeer could be going to do at Cannes,\r\nand what motive could have led him to examine the banks of the Var. The\r\nreflections of Athos suggested nothing. His accustomed perspicacity was\r\nat fault. Raoul’s researches were not more successful than his father’s.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said the young man to the comte, who silently, and with\r\nhis finger, had made him understand the route of D’Artagnan; “we must\r\nconfess that there is a Providence always occupied in connecting our\r\ndestiny with that of M. d’Artagnan. There he is on the coast of Cannes,\r\nand you, monsieur, will, at least, conduct me as far as Toulon. Be\r\nassured that we shall meet with him more easily upon our route than on\r\nthis map.”\r\n\r\nThen, taking leave of Planchet, who was scolding his shopmen, even the\r\ncousin of Truchen, his successor, the gentlemen set out to pay a visit\r\nto M. de Beaufort. On leaving the grocer’s shop, they saw a coach, the\r\nfuture depository of the charms of Mademoiselle Truchen and Planchet’s\r\nbags of crowns.\r\n\r\n“Every one journeys towards happiness by the route he chooses,” said\r\nRaoul, in a melancholy tone.\r\n\r\n“Road to Fontainebleau!” cried Planchet to his coachman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXX. The Inventory of M. de Beaufort.\r\n\r\nTo have talked of D’Artagnan with Planchet, to have seen Planchet quit\r\nParis to bury himself in his country retreat, had been for Athos and his\r\nson like a last farewell to the noise of the capital--to their life of\r\nformer days. What, in fact, did these men leave behind them--one of whom\r\nhad exhausted the past age in glory, and the other, the present age\r\nin misfortune? Evidently neither of them had anything to ask of his\r\ncontemporaries. They had only to pay a visit to M. de Beaufort, and\r\narrange with him the particulars of departure. The duke was lodged\r\nmagnificently in Paris. He had one of those superb establishments\r\npertaining to great fortunes, the like of which certain old men\r\nremembered to have seen in all their glory in the times of wasteful\r\nliberality of Henry III.’s reign. Then, really, several great nobles\r\nwere richer than the king. They knew it, used it, and never deprived\r\nthemselves of the pleasure of humiliating his royal majesty when they\r\nhad an opportunity. It was this egotistical aristocracy Richelieu had\r\nconstrained to contribute, with its blood, its purse, and its duties, to\r\nwhat was from his time styled the king’s service. From Louis XI.--that\r\nterrible mower-down of the great--to Richelieu, how many families had\r\nraised their heads! How many, from Richelieu to Louis XIV., had bowed\r\ntheir heads, never to raise them again! But M. de Beaufort was born a\r\nprince, and of a blood which is not shed upon scaffolds, unless by the\r\ndecree of peoples,--a prince who had kept up a grand style of living.\r\nHow did he maintain his horses, his people, and his table? Nobody knew;\r\nhimself less than others. Only there were then privileges for the sons\r\nof kings, to whom nobody refused to become a creditor, whether from\r\nrespect or the persuasion that they would some day be paid.\r\n\r\nAthos and Raoul found the mansion of the duke in as much confusion as\r\nthat of Planchet. The duke, likewise, was making his inventory; that is\r\nto say, he was distributing to his friends everything of value he had\r\nin his house. Owing nearly two millions--an enormous amount in those\r\ndays--M. de Beaufort had calculated that he could not set out for\r\nAfrica without a good round sum, and, in order to find that sum, he was\r\ndistributing to his old creditors plate, arms, jewels, and furniture,\r\nwhich was more magnificent in selling it, and brought him back double.\r\nIn fact, how could a man to whom ten thousand livres were owing, refuse\r\nto carry away a present worth six thousand, enhanced in estimation from\r\nhaving belonged to a descendant of Henry IV.? And how, after having\r\ncarried away that present, could he refuse ten thousand livres more to\r\nthis generous noble? This, then, was what had happened. The duke had\r\nno longer a dwelling-house--that had become useless to an admiral whose\r\nplace of residence is his ship; he had no longer need of superfluous\r\narms, when he was placed amidst his cannons; no more jewels, which the\r\nsea might rob him of; but he had three or four hundred thousand crowns\r\nfresh in his coffers. And throughout the house there was a joyous\r\nmovement of people who believed they were plundering monseigneur. The\r\nprince had, in a supreme degree, the art of making happy the creditors\r\nmost to be pitied. Every distressed man, every empty purse, found in him\r\npatience and sympathy for his position. To some he said, “I wish I had\r\nwhat _you_ have; I would give it you.” And to others, “I have but this\r\nsilver ewer; it is worth at least five hundred livres,--take it.” The\r\neffect of which was--so truly is courtesy a current payment--that the\r\nprince constantly found means to renew his creditors. This time he\r\nused no ceremony; it might be called a general pillage. He gave up\r\neverything. The Oriental fable of the poor Arab who carried away from\r\nthe pillage of palace a kettle at the bottom of which was concealed a\r\nbag of gold, and whom everybody allowed to pass without jealousy,--this\r\nfable had become a truth in the prince’s mansion. Many contractors paid\r\nthemselves upon the offices of the duke. Thus, the provision department,\r\nwho plundered the clothes-presses and the harness-rooms, attached very\r\nlittle value to things which tailors and saddlers set great store by.\r\nAnxious to carry home to their wives presents given them by monseigneur,\r\nmany were seen bounding joyously along, under the weight of earthen\r\njars and bottles, gloriously stamped with the arms of the prince. M. de\r\nBeaufort finished by giving away his horses and the hay from his lofts.\r\nHe made more than thirty happy with kitchen utensils; and thirty more\r\nwith the contents of his cellar. Still further; all these people went\r\naway with the conviction that M. de Beaufort only acted in this manner\r\nto prepare for a new fortune concealed beneath the Arabs’ tents. They\r\nrepeated to each other, while pillaging his hotel, that he was sent to\r\nGigelli by the king to reconstruct his lost fortunes; that the treasures\r\nof Africa would be equally divided between the admiral and the king of\r\nFrance; that these treasures consisted in mines of diamonds, or other\r\nfabulous stones; the gold and silver mines of Mount Atlas did not\r\neven obtain the honor of being named. In addition to the mines to be\r\nworked--which could not be begun till after the campaign--there would\r\nbe the booty made by the army. M. de Beaufort would lay his hands on\r\nall the riches pirates had robbed Christendom of since the battle of\r\nLepanto. The number of millions from these sources defied calculation.\r\nWhy, then, should he, who was going in quest of such treasure, set\r\nany store by the poor utensils of his past life? And reciprocally, why\r\nshould they spare the property of him who spared it so little himself?\r\n\r\nSuch was the position of affairs. Athos, with his piercing practiced\r\nglance, saw what was going on at once. He found the admiral of France a\r\nlittle exalted, for he was rising from a table of fifty covers, at\r\nwhich the guests had drunk long and deeply to the prosperity of the\r\nexpedition; at the conclusion of which repast, the remains, with the\r\ndessert, had been given to the servants, and the empty dishes and\r\nplates to the curious. The prince was intoxicated with his ruin and his\r\npopularity at one and the same time. He had drunk his old wine to the\r\nhealth of his wine of the future. When he saw Athos and Raoul:\r\n\r\n“There is my aide-de-camp being brought to me!” he cried. “Come hither,\r\ncomte; come hither, vicomte.”\r\n\r\nAthos tried to find a passage through the heaps of linen and plate.\r\n\r\n“Ah! step over, step over!” said the duke, offering a full glass to\r\nAthos. The latter drank it; Raoul scarcely moistened his lips.\r\n\r\n“Here is your commission,” said the prince to Raoul. “I had prepared it,\r\nreckoning upon you. You will go before me as far as Antibes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Here is the order.” And De Beaufort gave Raoul the order. “Do you know\r\nanything of the sea?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur; I have traveled with M. le Prince.”\r\n\r\n“That is well. All these barges and lighters must be in attendance to\r\nform an escort and carry my provisions. The army must be prepared to\r\nembark in a fortnight at the very latest.”\r\n\r\n“That shall be done, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“The present order gives you the right to visit and search all the isles\r\nalong the coast; you will there make the enrolments and levies you may\r\nwant for me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur le duc.”\r\n\r\n“And you are an active man, and will work freely, you will spend much\r\nmoney.”\r\n\r\n“I hope not, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“But I am sure you will. My intendant has prepared the orders of a\r\nthousand livres, drawn upon the cities of the south; he will give you a\r\nhundred of them. Now, dear vicomte, be gone.”\r\n\r\nAthos interrupted the prince. “Keep your money, monseigneur; war is to\r\nbe waged among the Arabs with gold as well as lead.”\r\n\r\n“I wish to try the contrary,” replied the duke; “and then you are\r\nacquainted with my ideas upon the expedition--plenty of noise, plenty\r\nof fire, and, if so it must be, I shall disappear in the smoke.” Having\r\nspoken thus, M. de Beaufort began to laugh; but his mirth was not\r\nreciprocated by Athos and Raoul. He perceived this at once. “Ah,” said\r\nhe, with the courteous egotism of his rank and age, “you are such people\r\nas a man should not see after dinner; you are cold, stiff, and dry when\r\nI am all fire, suppleness, and wine. No, devil take me! I should always\r\nsee you fasting, vicomte, and you, comte, if you wear such a face as\r\nthat, you shall see me no more.”\r\n\r\nHe said this, pressing the hand of Athos, who replied with a smile,\r\n“Monseigneur, do not talk so grandly because you happen to have plenty\r\nof money. I predict that within a month you will be dry, stiff, and\r\ncold, in presence of your strong-box, and that then, having Raoul at\r\nyour elbow, fasting, you will be surprised to see him gay, animated, and\r\ngenerous, because he will have some new crowns to offer you.”\r\n\r\n“God grant it may be so!” cried the delighted duke. “Comte, stay with\r\nme!”\r\n\r\n“No, I shall go with Raoul; the mission with which you charge him is\r\na troublesome and difficult one. Alone it would be too much for him to\r\nexecute. You do not observe, monseigneur, you have given him command of\r\nthe first order.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!”\r\n\r\n“And in your naval arrangements, too.”\r\n\r\n“That may be true. But one finds that such fine young fellows as your\r\nson generally do all that is required of them.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, I believe you will find nowhere so much zeal and\r\nintelligence, so much real bravery, as in Raoul; but if he failed\r\nto arrange your embarkation, you would only meet the fate that you\r\ndeserve.”\r\n\r\n“Humph! you are scolding me, then.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, to provision a fleet, to assemble a flotilla, to enroll\r\nyour maritime force, would take an admiral a year. Raoul is a cavalry\r\nofficer, and you allow him a fortnight!”\r\n\r\n“I tell you he will do it.”\r\n\r\n“He may; but I will go and help him.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure you will; I reckoned upon you, and still further believe\r\nthat when we are once at Toulon you will not let him depart alone.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Athos, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Patience! patience!”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, permit us to take our leave.”\r\n\r\n“Begone, then, and may my good luck attend you.”\r\n\r\n“Adieu! monseigneur; and may your own good luck attend you likewise.”\r\n\r\n“Here is an expedition admirably commenced!” said Athos to his son. “No\r\nprovisions--no store flotilla! What can be done, thus?”\r\n\r\n“Humph!” murmured Raoul; “if all are going to do as I am, provisions\r\nwill not be wanted.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied Athos, sternly, “do not be unjust and senseless in\r\nyour egotism, or your grief, whichever you please to call it. If you set\r\nout for this war solely with the intention of getting killed therein,\r\nyou stand in need of nobody, and it was scarcely worth while to\r\nrecommend you to M. de Beaufort. But when you have been introduced to\r\nthe prime commandant--when you have accepted the responsibility of a\r\npost in his army, the question is no longer about _you_, but about all\r\nthose poor soldiers, who, as well as you, have hearts and bodies, who\r\nwill weep for their country and endure all the necessities of their\r\ncondition. Remember, Raoul, that officers are ministers as useful to the\r\nworld as priests, and that they ought to have more charity.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, I know it and have practiced it; I would have continued to do\r\nso still, but--”\r\n\r\n“You forget also that you are of a country that is proud of its military\r\nglory; go and die if you like, but do not die without honor and without\r\nadvantage to France. Cheer up, Raoul! do not let my words grieve you; I\r\nlove you, and wish to see you perfect.”\r\n\r\n“I love your reproaches, monsieur,” said the young man, mildly; “they\r\nalone may cure me, because they prove to me that some one loves me\r\nstill.”\r\n\r\n“And now, Raoul, let us be off; the weather is so fine, the heavens so\r\nclear, those heavens which we always find above our heads, which you\r\nwill see more clear still at Gigelli, and which will speak to you of me\r\nthere, as they speak to me here of God.”\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen, after having agreed on this point, talked over the\r\nwild freaks of the duke, convinced that France would be served in a very\r\nincomplete manner, as regarded both spirit and practice, in the ensuing\r\nexpedition; and having summed up the ducal policy under the one word\r\nvanity, they set forward, in obedience rather to their will than\r\ndestiny. The sacrifice was half accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI. The Silver Dish.\r\n\r\nThe journey passed off pretty well. Athos and his son traversed France\r\nat the rate of fifteen leagues per day; sometimes more, sometimes less,\r\naccording to the intensity of Raoul’s grief. It took them a fortnight\r\nto reach Toulon, and they lost all traces of D’Artagnan at Antibes. They\r\nwere forced to believe that the captain of the musketeers was desirous\r\nof preserving an incognito on his route, for Athos derived from\r\nhis inquiries an assurance that such a cavalier as he described had\r\nexchanged his horse for a well-closed carriage on quitting Avignon.\r\nRaoul was much affected at not meeting with D’Artagnan. His affectionate\r\nheart longed to take a farewell and received consolation from that heart\r\nof steel. Athos knew from experience that D’Artagnan became impenetrable\r\nwhen engaged in any serious affair, whether on his own account or on the\r\nservice of the king. He even feared to offend his friend, or thwart him\r\nby too pressing inquiries. And yet when Raoul commenced his labor of\r\nclassing the flotilla, and got together the _chalands_ and lighters to\r\nsend them to Toulon, one of the fishermen told the comte that his boat\r\nhad been laid up to refit since a trip he had made on account of a\r\ngentleman who was in great haste to embark. Athos, believing that this\r\nman was telling a falsehood in order to be left at liberty to fish,\r\nand so gain more money when all his companions were gone, insisted upon\r\nhaving the details. The fisherman informed him that six days previously,\r\na man had come in the night to hire his boat, for the purpose of\r\nvisiting the island of St. Honnorat. The price was agreed upon, but the\r\ngentleman had arrived with an immense carriage case, which he insisted\r\nupon embarking, in spite of the many difficulties that opposed the\r\noperation. The fisherman wished to retract. He had even threatened,\r\nbut his threats had procured him nothing but a shower of blows from the\r\ngentleman’s cane, which fell upon his shoulders sharp and long. Swearing\r\nand grumbling, he had recourse to the syndic of his brotherhood at\r\nAntibes, who administer justice among themselves and protect each other;\r\nbut the gentleman had exhibited a certain paper, at sight of which\r\nthe syndic, bowing to the very ground, enjoined obedience from the\r\nfisherman, and abused him for having been refractory. They then departed\r\nwith the freight.\r\n\r\n“But all this does not tell us,” said Athos, “how you injured your\r\nboat.”\r\n\r\n“This is the way. I was steering towards St. Honnorat as the gentleman\r\ndesired me; but he changed his mind, and pretended that I could not pass\r\nto the south of the abbey.”\r\n\r\n“And why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because, monsieur, there is in front of the square tower of the\r\nBenedictines, towards the southern point, the bank of the _Moines_.”\r\n\r\n“A rock?” asked Athos.\r\n\r\n“Level with the water, but below water; a dangerous passage, yet one I\r\nhave cleared a thousand times; the gentleman required me to land him at\r\nSainte-Marguerite’s.”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well, monsieur!” cried the fisherman, with his _Provencal_ accent, “a\r\nman is a sailor, or he is not; he knows his course, or he is nothing but\r\na fresh-water lubber. I was obstinate, and wished to try the channel.\r\nThe gentleman took me by the collar, and told me quietly he would\r\nstrangle me. My mate armed himself with a hatchet, and so did I. We had\r\nthe affront of the night before to pay him out for. But the gentleman\r\ndrew his sword, and used it in such an astonishingly rapid manner, that\r\nwe neither of us could get near him. I was about to hurl my hatchet at\r\nhis head, and I had a right to do so, hadn’t I, monsieur? for a sailor\r\naboard is master, as a citizen is in his chamber; I was going, then, in\r\nself-defense, to cut the gentleman in two, when, all at once--believe me\r\nor not, monsieur--the great carriage case opened of itself, I don’t know\r\nhow, and there came out of it a sort of a phantom, his head covered with\r\na black helmet and a black mask, something terrible to look upon, which\r\ncame towards me threatening with its fist.”\r\n\r\n“And that was--” said Athos.\r\n\r\n“That was the devil, monsieur; for the gentleman, with great glee, cried\r\nout, on seeing him: ‘Ah! thank you, monseigneur!’”\r\n\r\n“A most strange story!” murmured the comte, looking at Raoul.\r\n\r\n“And what did you do?” asked the latter of the fisherman.\r\n\r\n“You must know, monsieur, that two poor men, such as we are, could be\r\nno match for two gentlemen; but when one of them turned out to be the\r\ndevil, we had no earthly chance! My companion and I did not stop to\r\nconsult one another; we made but one jump into the sea, for we were\r\nwithin seven or eight hundred feet of the shore.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and then?”\r\n\r\n“Why, and then, monseigneur, as there was a little wind from the\r\nsouthwest, the boat drifted into the sands of Sainte-Marguerite’s.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!--but the travelers?”\r\n\r\n“Bah! you need not be uneasy about them! It was pretty plain that one\r\nwas the devil, and protected the other; for when we recovered the boat,\r\nafter she got afloat again, instead of finding these two creatures\r\ninjured by the shock, we found nothing, not even the carriage or the\r\ncase.”\r\n\r\n“Very strange! very strange!” repeated the comte. “But after that, what\r\ndid you do, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“I made my complaint to the governor of Sainte-Marguerite’s, who brought\r\nmy finger under my nose by telling me if I plagued him with such silly\r\nstories he would have me flogged.”\r\n\r\n“What! did the governor himself say so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur; and yet my boat was injured, seriously injured, for the\r\nprow is left upon the point of Sainte-Marguerite’s, and the carpenter\r\nasks a hundred and twenty livres to repair it.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied Raoul; “you will be exempted from the service. Go.”\r\n\r\n“We will go to Sainte-Marguerite’s, shall we?” said the comte to\r\nBragelonne, as the man walked away.\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur, for there is something to be cleared up; that man does\r\nnot seem to me to have told the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Nor to me either, Raoul. The story of the masked man and the carriage\r\nhaving disappeared, may be told to conceal some violence these fellows\r\nhave committed upon their passengers in the open sea, to punish him for\r\nhis persistence in embarking.”\r\n\r\n“I formed the same suspicion; the carriage was more likely to contain\r\nproperty than a man.”\r\n\r\n“We shall see to that, Raoul. The gentleman very much resembles\r\nD’Artagnan; I recognize his methods of proceeding. Alas! we are no\r\nlonger the young invincibles of former days. Who knows whether the\r\nhatchet or the iron bar of this miserable coaster has not succeeded in\r\ndoing that which the best blades of Europe, balls, and bullets have not\r\nbeen able to do in forty years?”\r\n\r\nThat same day they set out for Sainte-Marguerite’s, on board a\r\n_chasse-maree_ come from Toulon under orders. The impression they\r\nexperienced on landing was a singularly pleasing one. The island seemed\r\nloaded with flowers and fruits. In its cultivated part it served as a\r\ngarden for the governor. Orange, pomegranate, and fig trees bent beneath\r\nthe weight of their golden or purple fruits. All round this garden, in\r\nthe uncultivated parts, red partridges ran about in conveys among the\r\nbrambles and tufts of junipers, and at every step of the comte and Raoul\r\na terrified rabbit quitted his thyme and heath to scuttle away to the\r\nburrow. In fact, this fortunate isle was uninhabited. Flat, offering\r\nnothing but a tiny bay for the convenience of embarkation, and under the\r\nprotection of the governor, who went shares with them, smugglers made\r\nuse of it as a provisional _entrepot_, at the expense of not killing the\r\ngame or devastating the garden. With this compromise, the governor was\r\nin a situation to be satisfied with a garrison of eight men to guard his\r\nfortress, in which twelve cannons accumulated coats of moldy green. The\r\ngovernor was a sort of happy farmer, harvesting wines, figs, oil,\r\nand oranges, preserving his citrons and _cedrates_ in the sun of his\r\ncasemates. The fortress, encircled by a deep ditch, its only guardian,\r\narose like three heads upon turrets connected with each other by\r\nterraces covered with moss.\r\n\r\nAthos and Raoul wandered for some time round the fences of the garden\r\nwithout finding any one to introduce them to the governor. They ended by\r\nmaking their own way into the garden. It was at the hottest time of\r\nthe day. Each living thing sought its shelter under grass or stone. The\r\nheavens spread their fiery veils as if to stifle all noises, to envelop\r\nall existences; the rabbit under the broom, the fly under the leaf,\r\nslept as the wave did beneath the heavens. Athos saw nothing living but\r\na soldier, upon the terrace beneath the second and third court, who was\r\ncarrying a basket of provisions on his head. This man returned almost\r\nimmediately without his basket, and disappeared in the shade of his\r\nsentry-box. Athos supposed he must have been carrying dinner to some\r\none, and, after having done so, returned to dine himself. All at once\r\nthey heard some one call out, and raising their heads, perceived in the\r\nframe of the bars of the window something of a white color, like a\r\nhand that was waved backwards and forwards--something shining, like a\r\npolished weapon struck by the rays of the sun. And before they were able\r\nto ascertain what it was, a luminous train, accompanied by a hissing\r\nsound in the air, called their attention from the donjon to the ground.\r\nA second dull noise was heard from the ditch, and Raoul ran to pick up\r\na silver plate which was rolling along the dry sand. The hand that\r\nhad thrown this plate made a sign to the two gentlemen, and then\r\ndisappeared. Athos and Raoul, approaching each other, commenced an\r\nattentive examination of the dusty plate, and they discovered, in\r\ncharacters traced upon the bottom of it with the point of a knife, this\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n“_I am the brother of the king of France--a prisoner to-day--a madman\r\nto-morrow. French gentlemen and Christians, pray to God for the soul and\r\nthe reason of the son of your old rulers_.”\r\n\r\nThe plate fell from the hands of Athos whilst Raoul was endeavoring\r\nto make out the meaning of these dismal words. At the same moment they\r\nheard a cry from the top of the donjon. Quick as lightning Raoul\r\nbent down his head, and forced down that of his father likewise. A\r\nmusket-barrel glittered from the crest of the wall. A white smoke\r\nfloated like a plume from the mouth of the musket, and a ball was\r\nflattened against a stone within six inches of the two gentlemen.\r\n\r\n“_Cordieu!_” cried Athos. “What, are people assassinated here? Come\r\ndown, cowards as you are!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, come down!” cried Raoul, furiously shaking his fist at the castle.\r\n\r\nOne of the assailants--he who was about to fire--replied to these cries\r\nby an exclamation of surprise; and, as his companion, who wished to\r\ncontinue the attack, had re-seized his loaded musket, he who had cried\r\nout threw up the weapon, and the ball flew into the air. Athos and\r\nRaoul, seeing them disappear from the platform, expected they would\r\ncome down to them, and waited with a firm demeanor. Five minutes had\r\nnot elapsed, when a stroke upon a drum called the eight soldiers of the\r\ngarrison to arms, and they showed themselves on the other side of\r\nthe ditch with their muskets in hand. At the head of these men was an\r\nofficer, whom Athos and Raoul recognized as the one who had fired the\r\nfirst musket. The man ordered the soldiers to “make ready.”\r\n\r\n“We are going to be shot!” cried Raoul; “but, sword in hand, at least,\r\nlet us leap the ditch! We shall kill at least two of these scoundrels,\r\nwhen their muskets are empty.” And, suiting the action to the word,\r\nRaoul was springing forward, followed by Athos, when a well-known voice\r\nresounded behind them, “Athos! Raoul!”\r\n\r\n“D’Artagnan!” replied the two gentlemen.\r\n\r\n“Recover arms! _Mordioux!_” cried the captain to the soldiers. “I was\r\nsure I could not be mistaken!”\r\n\r\n“What is the meaning of this?” asked Athos. “What! were we to be shot\r\nwithout warning?”\r\n\r\n“It was I who was going to shoot you, and if the governor missed you, I\r\nshould not have missed you, my dear friends. How fortunate it is that\r\nI am accustomed to take a long aim, instead of firing at the instant I\r\nraise my weapon! I thought I recognized you. Ah! my dear friends, how\r\nfortunate!” And D’Artagnan wiped his brow, for he had run fast, and\r\nemotion with him was not feigned.\r\n\r\n“How!” said Athos. “And is the gentleman who fired at us the governor of\r\nthe fortress?”\r\n\r\n“In person.”\r\n\r\n“And why did he fire at us? What have we done to him?”\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ You received what the prisoner threw to you?”\r\n\r\n“That is true.”\r\n\r\n“That plate--the prisoner has written something on it, has he not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! I was afraid he had.”\r\n\r\nAnd D’Artagnan, with all the marks of mortal disquietude, seized the\r\nplate, to read the inscription. When he had read it, a fearful pallor\r\nspread across his countenance. “Oh! good heavens!” repeated he.\r\n“Silence!--Here is the governor.”\r\n\r\n“And what will he do to us? Is it our fault?”\r\n\r\n“It is true, then?” said Athos, in a subdued voice. “It is true?”\r\n\r\n“Silence! I tell you--silence! If he only believes you can read; if he\r\nonly suspects you have understood; I love you, my dear friends, I would\r\nwillingly be killed for you, but--”\r\n\r\n“But--” said Athos and Raoul.\r\n\r\n“But I could not save you from perpetual imprisonment if I saved you\r\nfrom death. Silence, then! Silence again!”\r\n\r\nThe governor came up, having crossed the ditch upon a plank bridge.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said he to D’Artagnan, “what stops us?”\r\n\r\n“You are Spaniards--you do not understand a word of French,” said the\r\ncaptain, eagerly, to his friends in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Well!” replied he, addressing the governor, “I was right; these\r\ngentlemen are two Spanish captains with whom I was acquainted at Ypres,\r\nlast year; they don’t know a word of French.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the governor, sharply. “And yet they were trying to read the\r\ninscription on the plate.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan took it out of his hands, effacing the characters with the\r\npoint of his sword.\r\n\r\n“How!” cried the governor, “what are you doing? I cannot read them now!”\r\n\r\n“It is a state secret,” replied D’Artagnan, bluntly; “and as you know\r\nthat, according to the king’s orders, it is under the penalty of death\r\nany one should penetrate it, I will, if you like, allow you to read it,\r\nand have you shot immediately afterwards.”\r\n\r\nDuring this apostrophe--half serious, half ironical--Athos and Raoul\r\npreserved the coolest, most unconcerned silence.\r\n\r\n“But, is it possible,” said the governor, “that these gentlemen do not\r\ncomprehend at least some words?”\r\n\r\n“Suppose they do! If they do understand a few spoken words, it does not\r\nfollow that they should understand what is written. They cannot even\r\nread Spanish. A noble Spaniard, remember, ought never to know how to\r\nread.”\r\n\r\nThe governor was obliged to be satisfied with these explanations, but he\r\nwas still tenacious. “Invite these gentlemen to come to the fortress,”\r\n said he.\r\n\r\n“That I will willingly do. I was about to propose it to you.” The\r\nfact is, the captain had quite another idea, and would have wished his\r\nfriends a hundred leagues off. But he was obliged to make the best of\r\nit. He addressed the two gentlemen in Spanish, giving them a polite\r\ninvitation, which they accepted. They all turned towards the entrance of\r\nthe fort, and, the incident being at an end, the eight soldiers returned\r\nto their delightful leisure, for a moment disturbed by this unexpected\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII. Captive and Jailers.\r\n\r\nWhen they had entered the fort, and whilst the governor was making some\r\npreparations for the reception of his guests, “Come,” said Athos, “let\r\nus have a word of explanation whilst we are alone.”\r\n\r\n“It is simply this,” replied the musketeer. “I have conducted hither a\r\nprisoner, who the king commands shall not be seen. You came here, he\r\nhas thrown something to you through the lattice of his window; I was at\r\ndinner with the governor, I saw the object thrown, and I saw Raoul pick\r\nit up. It does not take long to understand this. I understood it, and I\r\nthought you in intelligence with my prisoner. And then--”\r\n\r\n“And then--you commanded us to be shot.”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ I admit it; but, if I was the first to seize a musket,\r\nfortunately, I was the last to take aim at you.”\r\n\r\n“If you had killed me, D’Artagnan, I should have had the good fortune\r\nto die for the royal house of France, and it would be an honor to die by\r\nyour hand--you, its noblest and most loyal defender.”\r\n\r\n“What the devil, Athos, do you mean by the royal house?” stammered\r\nD’Artagnan. “You don’t mean that you, a well-informed and sensible man,\r\ncan place any faith in the nonsense written by an idiot?”\r\n\r\n“I do believe in it.”\r\n\r\n“With so much the more reason, my dear chevalier, from your having\r\norders to kill all those who do believe in it,” said Raoul.\r\n\r\n“That is because,” replied the captain of the musketeers--“because every\r\ncalumny, however absurd it may be, has the almost certain chance of\r\nbecoming popular.”\r\n\r\n“No, D’Artagnan,” replied Athos, promptly; “but because the king is not\r\nwilling that the secret of his family should transpire among the people,\r\nand cover with shame the executioners of the son of Louis XIII.”\r\n\r\n“Do not talk in such a childish manner, Athos, or I shall begin to think\r\nyou have lost your senses. Besides, explain to me how it is possible\r\nLouis XIII. should have a son in the Isle of Sainte-Marguerite.”\r\n\r\n“A son whom you have brought hither masked, in a fishing-boat,” said\r\nAthos. “Why not?”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan was brought to a pause.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said he; “whence do you know that a fishing-boat--?”\r\n\r\n“Brought you to Sainte-Marguerite’s with the carriage containing\r\nthe prisoner--with a prisoner whom you styled monseigneur. Oh! I\r\nam acquainted with all that,” resumed the comte. D’Artagnan bit his\r\nmustache.\r\n\r\n“If it were true,” said he, “that I had brought hither in a boat and\r\nwith a carriage a masked prisoner, nothing proves that this prisoner\r\nmust be a prince--a prince of the house of France.”\r\n\r\n“Ask Aramis such riddles,” replied Athos, coolly.\r\n\r\n“Aramis,” cried the musketeer, quite at a stand. “Have you seen Aramis?”\r\n\r\n“After his discomfiture at Vaux, yes; I have seen Aramis, a fugitive,\r\npursued, bewildered, ruined; and Aramis has told me enough to make me\r\nbelieve in the complaints this unfortunate young prince cut upon the\r\nbottom of the plate.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan’s head sunk on his breast in some confusion. “This is the\r\nway,” said he, “in which God turns to nothing that which men call\r\nwisdom! A fine secret must that be of which twelve or fifteen persons\r\nhold the tattered fragments! Athos, cursed be the chance which has\r\nbrought you face to face with me in this affair! for now--”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Athos, with his customary mild severity, “is your secret\r\nlost because I know it? Consult your memory, my friend. Have I not borne\r\nsecrets heavier than this?”\r\n\r\n“You have never borne one so dangerous,” replied D’Artagnan, in a tone\r\nof sadness. “I have something like a sinister idea that all who are\r\nconcerned with this secret will die, and die unhappily.”\r\n\r\n“The will of God be done!” said Athos, “but here is your governor.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan and his friends immediately resumed their parts. The\r\ngovernor, suspicious and hard, behaved towards D’Artagnan with a\r\npoliteness almost amounting to obsequiousness. With respect to the\r\ntravelers, he contented himself with offering good cheer, and never\r\ntaking his eye from them. Athos and Raoul observed that he often tried\r\nto embarrass them by sudden attacks, or to catch them off their guard;\r\nbut neither the one nor the other gave him the least advantage. What\r\nD’Artagnan had said was probable, if the governor did not believe it to\r\nbe quite true. They rose from the table to repose awhile.\r\n\r\n“What is this man’s name? I don’t like the looks of him,” said Athos to\r\nD’Artagnan in Spanish.\r\n\r\n“De Saint-Mars,” replied the captain.\r\n\r\n“He is, then, I suppose, the prince’s jailer?”\r\n\r\n“Eh! how can I tell? I may be kept at Sainte-Marguerite forever.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no, not you!”\r\n\r\n“My friend, I am in the situation of a man who finds a treasure in the\r\nmidst of a desert. He would like to carry it away, but he cannot; he\r\nwould like to leave it, but he dares not. The king will not dare to\r\nrecall me, for no one else would serve him as faithfully as I do; he\r\nregrets not having me near him, from being aware that no one would be of\r\nso much service near his person as myself. But it will happen as it may\r\nplease God.”\r\n\r\n“But,” observed Raoul, “your not being certain proves that your\r\nsituation here is provisional, and you will return to Paris?”\r\n\r\n“Ask these gentlemen,” interrupted the governor, “what was their purpose\r\nin coming to Saint-Marguerite?”\r\n\r\n“They came from learning there was a convent of Benedictines at\r\nSainte-Honnorat which is considered curious; and from being told there\r\nwas excellent shooting in the island.”\r\n\r\n“That is quite at their service, as well as yours,” replied Saint-Mars.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan politely thanked him.\r\n\r\n“When will they depart?” added the governor.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow,” replied D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nM. de Saint-Mars went to make his rounds, and left D’Artagnan alone with\r\nthe pretended Spaniards.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed the musketeer, “here is a life and a society that suits\r\nme very little. I command this man, and he bores me, _mordioux!_ Come,\r\nlet us have a shot or two at the rabbits; the walk will be beautiful,\r\nand not fatiguing. The whole island is but a league and a half in\r\nlength, with the breadth of a league; a real park. Let us try to amuse\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n“As you please, D’Artagnan; not for the sake of amusing ourselves, but\r\nto gain an opportunity for talking freely.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan made a sign to a soldier, who brought the gentlemen some\r\nguns, and then returned to the fort.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said the musketeer, “answer me the question put to you by\r\nthat black-looking Saint-Mars: what did you come to do at the Lerin\r\nIsles?”\r\n\r\n“To bid you farewell.”\r\n\r\n“Bid me farewell! What do you mean by that? Is Raoul going anywhere?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will lay a wager it is with M. de Beaufort.”\r\n\r\n“With M. de Beaufort it is, my dear friend. You always guess correctly.”\r\n\r\n“From habit.”\r\n\r\nWhilst the two friends were commencing their conversation, Raoul, with\r\nhis head hanging down and his heart oppressed, seated himself on a\r\nmossy rock, his gun across his knees, looking at the sea--looking at\r\nthe heavens, and listening to the voice of his soul; he allowed the\r\nsportsmen to attain a considerable distance from him. D’Artagnan\r\nremarked his absence.\r\n\r\n“He has not recovered the blow?” said he to Athos.\r\n\r\n“He is struck to death.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! your fears exaggerate, I hope. Raoul is of a tempered nature.\r\nAround all hearts as noble as his, there is a second envelope that forms\r\na cuirass. The first bleeds, the second resists.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Athos, “Raoul will die of it.”\r\n\r\n“_Mordioux!_” said D’Artagnan, in a melancholy tone. And he did not add\r\na word to this exclamation. Then, a minute after, “Why do you let him\r\ngo?”\r\n\r\n“Because he insists on going.”\r\n\r\n“And why do you not go with him?”\r\n\r\n“Because I could not bear to see him die.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan looked his friend earnestly in the face. “You know one\r\nthing,” continued the comte, leaning upon the arm of the captain; “you\r\nknow that in the course of my life I have been afraid of but few things.\r\nWell! I have an incessant gnawing, insurmountable fear that an hour will\r\ncome in which I shall hold the dead body of that boy in my arms.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” murmured D’Artagnan; “oh!”\r\n\r\n“He will die, I know, I have a perfect conviction of that; but I would\r\nnot see him die.”\r\n\r\n“How is this, Athos? you come and place yourself in the presence of the\r\nbravest man, you say you have ever seen, of your own D’Artagnan, of that\r\nman without an equal, as you formerly called him, and you come and tell\r\nhim, with your arms folded, that you are afraid of witnessing the death\r\nof your son, you who have seen all that can be seen in this world! Why\r\nhave you this fear, Athos? Man upon this earth must expect everything,\r\nand ought to face everything.”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, my friend. After having worn myself out upon this earth\r\nof which you speak, I have preserved but two religions: that of life,\r\nfriendship, my duty as a father--that of eternity, love, and respect for\r\nGod. Now, I have within me the revelation that if God should decree that\r\nmy friend or my son should render up his last sigh in my presence--oh!\r\nno, I cannot even tell you, D’Artagnan!”\r\n\r\n“Speak, speak, tell me!”\r\n\r\n“I am strong against everything, except against the death of those I\r\nlove. For that only there is no remedy. He who dies, gains; he who sees\r\nothers die, loses. No, this is it--to know that I should no more meet on\r\nearth him whom I now behold with joy; to know that there would nowhere\r\nbe a D’Artagnan any more, nowhere again be a Raoul, oh! I am old, look\r\nyou, I have no longer courage; I pray God to spare me in my weakness;\r\nbut if he struck me so plainly and in that fashion, I should curse him.\r\nA Christian gentleman ought not to curse his God, D’Artagnan; it is\r\nenough to once have cursed a king!”\r\n\r\n“Humph!” sighed D’Artagnan, a little confused by this violent tempest of\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n“Let me speak to him, Athos. Who knows?”\r\n\r\n“Try, if you please, but I am convinced you will not succeed.”\r\n\r\n“I will not attempt to console him. I will serve him.”\r\n\r\n“You will?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, I will. Do you think this would be the first time a woman\r\nhad repented of an infidelity? I will go to him, I tell you.”\r\n\r\nAthos shook his head, and continued his walk alone, D’Artagnan, cutting\r\nacross the brambles, rejoined Raoul and held out his hand to him. “Well,\r\nRaoul! You have something to say to me?”\r\n\r\n“I have a kindness to ask of you,” replied Bragelonne.\r\n\r\n“Ask it, then.”\r\n\r\n“You will some day return to France?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so.”\r\n\r\n“Ought I to write to Mademoiselle de la Vallière?”\r\n\r\n“No, you must not.”\r\n\r\n“But I have many things to say to her.”\r\n\r\n“Go and say them to her, then.”\r\n\r\n“Never!”\r\n\r\n“Pray, what virtue do you attribute to a letter, which your speech might\r\nnot possess?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right.”\r\n\r\n“She loves the king,” said D’Artagnan, bluntly; “and she is an honest\r\ngirl.” Raoul started. “And you, you whom she abandons, she, perhaps,\r\nloves better than she does the king, but after another fashion.”\r\n\r\n“D’Artagnan, do you believe she loves the king?”\r\n\r\n“To idolatry. Her heart is inaccessible to any other feeling. You might\r\ncontinue to live near her, and would be her best friend.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” exclaimed Raoul, with a passionate burst of repugnance at such a\r\nhideous hope.\r\n\r\n“Will you do so?”\r\n\r\n“It would be base.”\r\n\r\n“That is a very absurd word, which would lead me to think slightly of\r\nyour understanding. Please to understand, Raoul, that it is never base\r\nto do that which is imposed upon us by a superior force. If your heart\r\nsays to you, ‘Go there, or die,’ why go, Raoul. Was she base or brave,\r\nshe whom you loved, in preferring the king to you, the king whom her\r\nheart commanded her imperiously to prefer to you? No, she was the\r\nbravest of women. Do, then, as she has done. Oblige yourself. Do you\r\nknow one thing of which I am sure, Raoul?”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that by seeing her closely with the eyes of a jealous man--”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“Well! you would cease to love her.”\r\n\r\n“Then I am decided, my dear D’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“To set off to see her again?”\r\n\r\n“No; to set off that I may _never_ see her again. I wish to love her\r\nforever.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! I must confess,” replied the musketeer, “that is a conclusion which\r\nI was far from expecting.”\r\n\r\n“This is what I wish, my friend. You will see her again, and you will\r\ngive her a letter which, if you think proper, will explain to her, as to\r\nyourself, what is passing in my heart. Read it; I drew it up last night.\r\nSomething told me I should see you to-day.” He held the letter out, and\r\nD’Artagnan read:\r\n\r\n“MADEMOISELLE,--You are not wrong in my eyes in not loving me. You have\r\nonly been guilty of one fault towards me, that of having left me to\r\nbelieve you loved me. This error will cost me my life. I pardon you,\r\nbut I cannot pardon myself. It is said that happy lovers are deaf to the\r\nsorrows of rejected lovers. It will not be so with you, who did not love\r\nme, save with anxiety. I am sure that if I had persisted in endeavoring\r\nto change that friendship into love, you would have yielded out of a\r\nfear of bringing about my death, or lessening the esteem I had for you.\r\nIt is much more delightful to me to die, knowing that _you_ are free\r\nand satisfied. How much, then, will you love me, when you will no\r\nlonger fear either my presence or reproaches? You will love me, because,\r\nhowever charming a new love may appear to you, God has not made me in\r\nanything inferior to him you have chosen, and because my devotedness,\r\nmy sacrifice, and my painful end will assure me, in your eyes, a certain\r\nsuperiority over him. I have allowed to escape, in the candid credulity\r\nof my heart, the treasure I possessed. Many people tell me that you\r\nloved me enough to lead me to hope you would have loved me much. That\r\nidea takes from my mind all bitterness, and leads me only to blame\r\nmyself. You will accept this last farewell, and you will bless me\r\nfor having taken refuge in the inviolable asylum where hatred is\r\nextinguished, and where all love endures forever. Adieu, mademoiselle.\r\nIf your happiness could be purchased by the last drop of my blood, I\r\nwould shed that drop. I willingly make the sacrifice of it to my misery!\r\n\r\n“RAOUL, VICOTME DE BRAGELONNE.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“The letter reads very well,” said the captain. “I have only one fault\r\nto find with it.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me what that is!” said Raoul.\r\n\r\n“Why, it is that it tells everything, except the thing which exhales,\r\nlike a mortal poison from your eyes and from your heart; except the\r\nsenseless love which still consumes you.” Raoul grew paler, but remained\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n“Why did you not write simply these words:\r\n\r\n“‘MADEMOISELLE,--Instead of cursing you, I love you and I die.’”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” exclaimed Raoul, with a sinister kind of joy.\r\n\r\nAnd tearing the letter he had just taken back, he wrote the following\r\nwords upon a leaf of his tablets:\r\n\r\n“To procure the happiness of once more telling you I love you, I commit\r\nthe baseness of writing to you; and to punish myself for that baseness,\r\nI die.” And he signed it.\r\n\r\n“You will give her these tablets, captain, will you not?”\r\n\r\n“When?” asked the latter.\r\n\r\n“On the day,” said Bragelonne, pointing to the last sentence, “on the\r\nday when you can place a date under these words.” And he sprang away\r\nquickly to join Athos, who was returning with slow steps.\r\n\r\nAs they re-entered the fort, the sea rose with that rapid, gusty\r\nvehemence which characterizes the Mediterranean; the ill-humor of\r\nthe element became a tempest. Something shapeless, and tossed about\r\nviolently by the waves, appeared just off the coast.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” said Athos,--“a wrecked boat?”\r\n\r\n“No, it is not a boat,” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said Raoul, “there is a bark gaining the port rapidly.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is a bark in the creek, which is prudently seeking shelter\r\nhere; but that which Athos points to in the sand is not a boat at\r\nall--it has run aground.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I see it.”\r\n\r\n“It is the carriage, which I threw into the sea after landing the\r\nprisoner.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” said Athos, “if you take my advice, D’Artagnan, you will burn\r\nthat carriage, in order that no vestige of it may remain, without which\r\nthe fishermen of Antibes, who have believed they had to do with the\r\ndevil, will endeavor to prove that your prisoner was but a man.”\r\n\r\n“Your advice is good, Athos, and I will this night have it carried out,\r\nor rather, I will carry it out myself; but let us go in, for the rain\r\nfalls heavily, and the lightning is terrific.”\r\n\r\nAs they were passing over the ramparts to a gallery of which D’Artagnan\r\nhad the key, they saw M. de Saint-Mars directing his steps towards the\r\nchamber inhabited by the prisoner. Upon a sign from D’Artagnan, they\r\nconcealed themselves in an angle of the staircase.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” said Athos.\r\n\r\n“You will see. Look. The prisoner is returning from chapel.”\r\n\r\nAnd they saw, by the red flashes of lightning against the violet fog\r\nwhich the wind stamped upon the bank-ward sky, they saw pass gravely,\r\nat six paces behind the governor, a man clothed in black and masked by a\r\nvizor of polished steel, soldered to a helmet of the same nature, which\r\naltogether enveloped the whole of his head. The fire of the heavens cast\r\nred reflections on the polished surface, and these reflections, flying\r\noff capriciously, seemed to be angry looks launched by the unfortunate,\r\ninstead of imprecations. In the middle of the gallery, the prisoner\r\nstopped for a moment, to contemplate the infinite horizon, to respire\r\nthe sulphurous perfumes of the tempest, to drink in thirstily the hot\r\nrain, and to breathe a sigh resembling a smothered groan.\r\n\r\n“Come on, monsieur,” said Saint-Mars, sharply, to the prisoner, for\r\nhe already became uneasy at seeing him look so long beyond the walls.\r\n“Monsieur, come on!”\r\n\r\n“Say monseigneur!” cried Athos, from his corner, with a voice so solemn\r\nand terrible, that the governor trembled from head to foot. Athos\r\ninsisted upon respect being paid to fallen majesty. The prisoner turned\r\nround.\r\n\r\n“Who spoke?” asked Saint-Mars.\r\n\r\n“It was I,” replied D’Artagnan, showing himself promptly. “You know that\r\nis the order.”\r\n\r\n“Call me neither monsieur nor monseigneur,” said the prisoner in his\r\nturn, in a voice that penetrated to the very soul of Raoul; “call me\r\nACCURSED!” He passed on, and the iron door croaked after him.\r\n\r\n“There goes a truly unfortunate man!” murmured the musketeer in a hollow\r\nwhisper, pointing out to Raoul the chamber inhabited by the prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIII. Promises.\r\n\r\nScarcely had D’Artagnan re-entered his apartment with his two friends,\r\nwhen one of the soldiers of the fort came to inform him that the\r\ngovernor was seeking him. The bark which Raoul had perceived at sea, and\r\nwhich appeared so eager to gain the port, came to Sainte-Marguerite with\r\nan important dispatch for the captain of the musketeers. On opening it,\r\nD’Artagnan recognized the writing of the king: “I should think,”\r\n said Louis XIV., “you will have completed the execution of my orders,\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan; return, then, immediately to Paris, and join me at\r\nthe Louvre.”\r\n\r\n“There is the end of my exile!” cried the musketeer with joy; “God be\r\npraised, I am no longer a jailer!” And he showed the letter to Athos.\r\n\r\n“So, then, you must leave us?” replied the latter, in a melancholy tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but to meet again, dear friend, seeing that Raoul is old enough\r\nnow to go alone with M. de Beaufort, and will prefer his father going\r\nback in company with M. d’Artagnan, to forcing him to travel two hundred\r\nleagues solitarily to reach home at La Fere; will you not, Raoul?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” stammered the latter, with an expression of tender regret.\r\n\r\n“No, no, my friend,” interrupted Athos, “I will never quit Raoul till\r\nthe day his vessel disappears on the horizon. As long as he remains in\r\nFrance he shall not be separated from me.”\r\n\r\n“As you please, dear friend; but we will, at least, leave\r\nSainte-Marguerite together; take advantage of the bark that will convey\r\nme back to Antibes.”\r\n\r\n“With all my heart; we cannot too soon be at a distance from this fort,\r\nand from the spectacle that shocked us so just now.”\r\n\r\nThe three friends quitted the little isle, after paying their respects\r\nto the governor, and by the last flashes of the departing tempest they\r\ntook their farewell of the white walls of the fort. D’Artagnan parted\r\nfrom his friend that same night, after having seen fire set to the\r\ncarriage upon the shore by the orders of Saint-Mars, according to the\r\nadvice the captain had given him. Before getting on horseback, and after\r\nleaving the arms of Athos: “My friends,” said he, “you bear too much\r\nresemblance to two soldiers who are abandoning their post. Something\r\nwarns me that Raoul will require being supported by you in his rank.\r\nWill you allow me to ask permission to go over into Africa with a\r\nhundred good muskets? The king will not refuse me, and I will take you\r\nwith me.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” replied Raoul, pressing his hand with emotion,\r\n“thanks for that offer, which would give us more than we wish, either\r\nmonsieur le comte or I. I, who am young, stand in need of labor of mind\r\nand fatigue of body; monsieur le comte wants the profoundest repose. You\r\nare his best friend. I recommend him to your care. In watching over him,\r\nyou are holding both our souls in your hands.”\r\n\r\n“I must go; my horse is all in a fret,” said D’Artagnan, with whom\r\nthe most manifest sign of a lively emotion was the change of ideas\r\nin conversation. “Come, comte, how many days longer has Raoul to stay\r\nhere?”\r\n\r\n“Three days at most.”\r\n\r\n“And how long will it take you to reach home?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! a considerable time,” replied Athos. “I shall not like the idea\r\nof being separated too quickly from Raoul. Time will travel too fast\r\nof itself to require me to aid it by distance. I shall only make\r\nhalf-stages.”\r\n\r\n“And why so, my friend? Nothing is more dull than traveling slowly; and\r\nhostelry life does not become a man like you.”\r\n\r\n“My friend, I came hither on post-horses; but I wish to purchase two\r\nanimals of a superior kind. Now, to take them home fresh, it would not\r\nbe prudent to make them travel more than seven or eight leagues a day.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Grimaud?”\r\n\r\n“He arrived yesterday morning with Raoul’s appointments; and I have left\r\nhim to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“That is, never to come back again,” D’Artagnan suffered to escape him.\r\n“Till we meet again, then, dear Athos--and if you are diligent, I shall\r\nembrace you the sooner.” So saying, he put his foot in the stirrup,\r\nwhich Raoul held.\r\n\r\n“Farewell!” said the young man, embracing him.\r\n\r\n“Farewell!” said D’Artagnan, as he got into his saddle.\r\n\r\nHis horse made a movement which divided the cavalier from his friends.\r\nThis scene had taken place in front of the house chosen by Athos, near\r\nthe gates of Antibes, whither D’Artagnan, after his supper, had ordered\r\nhis horses to be brought. The road began to branch off there, white and\r\nundulating in the vapors of the night. The horse eagerly respired the\r\nsalt, sharp perfume of the marshes. D’Artagnan put him to a trot; and\r\nAthos and Raoul sadly turned towards the house. All at once they heard\r\nthe rapid approach of a horse’s steps, and first believed it to be one\r\nof those singular repercussions which deceive the ear at every turn in\r\na road. But it was really the return of the horseman. They uttered a\r\ncry of joyous surprise; and the captain, springing to the ground like\r\na young man, seized within his arms the two beloved heads of Athos and\r\nRaoul. He held them long embraced thus, without speaking a word, or\r\nsuffering the sigh which was bursting his breast to escape him. Then, as\r\nrapidly as he had come back, he set off again, with a sharp application\r\nof his spurs to the sides of his fiery horse.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said the comte, in a low voice, “alas! alas!”\r\n\r\n“An evil omen!” on his side, said D’Artagnan to himself, making up for\r\nlost time. “I could not smile upon them. An evil omen!”\r\n\r\nThe next day Grimaud was on foot again. The service commanded by M. de\r\nBeaufort was happily accomplished. The flotilla, sent to Toulon by the\r\nexertions of Raoul, had set out, dragging after it in little nutshells,\r\nalmost invisible, the wives and friends of the fishermen and smugglers\r\nput in requisition for the service of the fleet. The time, so short,\r\nwhich remained for father and son to live together, appeared to go\r\nby with double rapidity, like some swift stream that flows towards\r\neternity. Athos and Raoul returned to Toulon, which began to be filled\r\nwith the noise of carriages, with the noise of arms, the noise of\r\nneighing horses. The trumpeters sounded their spirited marches; the\r\ndrummers signalized their strength; the streets were overflowing\r\nwith soldiers, servants, and tradespeople. The Duc de Beaufort was\r\neverywhere, superintending the embarkation with the zeal and interest of\r\na good captain. He encouraged the humblest of his companions; he scolded\r\nhis lieutenants, even those of the highest rank. Artillery, provisions,\r\nbaggage, he insisted upon seeing all himself. He examined the equipment\r\nof every soldier; assured himself of the health and soundness of every\r\nhorse. It was plain that, light, boastful, egotistical, in his hotel,\r\nthe gentleman became the soldier again--the high noble, a captain--in\r\nface of the responsibility he had accepted. And yet, it must be admitted\r\nthat, whatever was the care with which he presided over the preparations\r\nfor departure, it was easy to perceive careless precipitation, and the\r\nabsence of all the precaution that make the French soldier the first\r\nsoldier in the world, because, in that world, he is the one most\r\nabandoned to his own physical and moral resources. All things having\r\nsatisfied, or appearing to have satisfied, the admiral, he paid his\r\ncompliments to Raoul, and gave the last orders for sailing, which was\r\nordered the next morning at daybreak. He invited the comte had his son\r\nto dine with him; but they, under a pretext of service, kept themselves\r\napart. Gaining their hostelry, situated under the trees of the great\r\nPlace, they took their repast in haste, and Athos led Raoul to the\r\nrocks which dominate the city, vast gray mountains, whence the view is\r\ninfinite and embraces a liquid horizon which appears, so remote is it,\r\non a level with the rocks themselves. The night was fine, as it always\r\nis in these happy climes. The moon, rising behind the rocks, unrolled\r\na silver sheet on the cerulean carpet of the sea. In the roadsteads\r\nmaneuvered silently the vessels which had just taken their rank to\r\nfacilitate the embarkation. The sea, loaded with phosphoric light,\r\nopened beneath the hulls of the barks that transported the baggage and\r\nmunitions; every dip of the prow plowed up this gulf of white flames;\r\nfrom every oar dropped liquid diamonds. The sailors, rejoicing in the\r\nlargesses of the admiral, were heard murmuring their slow and artless\r\nsongs. Sometimes the grinding of the chains was mixed with the dull\r\nnoise of shot falling into the holds. Such harmonies, such a spectacle,\r\noppress the heart like fear, and dilate it like hope. All this life\r\nspeaks of death. Athos had seated himself with his son, upon the moss,\r\namong the brambles of the promontory. Around their heads passed and\r\nrepassed large bats, carried along by the fearful whirl of their blind\r\nchase. The feet of Raoul were over the edge of the cliff, bathed in that\r\nvoid which is peopled by vertigo, and provokes to self-annihilation.\r\nWhen the moon had risen to its fullest height, caressing with light\r\nthe neighboring peaks, when the watery mirror was illumined in its full\r\nextent, and the little red fires had made their openings in the black\r\nmasses of every ship, Athos, collecting all his ideas and all his\r\ncourage, said:\r\n\r\n“God has made all these things that we see, Raoul; He has made us\r\nalso,--poor atoms mixed up with this monstrous universe. We shine like\r\nthose fires and those stars; we sigh like those waves; we suffer like\r\nthose great ships, which are worn out in plowing the waves, in obeying\r\nthe wind that urges them towards an end, as the breath of God blows us\r\ntowards a port. Everything likes to live, Raoul; and everything seems\r\nbeautiful to living things.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said Raoul, “we have before us a beautiful spectacle!”\r\n\r\n“How good D’Artagnan is!” interrupted Athos, suddenly, “and what a rare\r\ngood fortune it is to be supported during a whole life by such a friend\r\nas he is! That is what you have missed, Raoul.”\r\n\r\n“A friend!” cried Raoul, “I have wanted a friend!”\r\n\r\n“M. de Guiche is an agreeable companion,” resumed the comte, coldly,\r\n“but I believe, in the times in which you live, men are more engaged in\r\ntheir own interests and their own pleasures than they were in ours. You\r\nhave sought a secluded life; that is a great happiness, but you have\r\nlost your strength thereby. We four, more weaned from those delicate\r\nabstractions that constitute your joy, furnished much more resistance\r\nwhen misfortune presented itself.”\r\n\r\n“I have not interrupted you, monsieur, to tell you that I had a friend,\r\nand that that friend is M. de Guiche. _Certes_, he is good and generous,\r\nand moreover he loves me. But I have lived under the guardianship of\r\nanother friendship, monsieur, as precious and as strong as that of which\r\nyou speak, since it is yours.”\r\n\r\n“I have not been a friend for you, Raoul,” said Athos.\r\n\r\n“Eh! monsieur, and in what respect not?”\r\n\r\n“Because I have given you reason to think that life has but one face,\r\nbecause, sad and severe, alas! I have always cut off for you, without,\r\nGod knows, wishing to do so, the joyous buds that spring incessantly\r\nfrom the fair tree of youth; so that at this moment I repent of not\r\nhaving made of you a more expansive, dissipated, animated man.”\r\n\r\n“I know why you say that, monsieur. No, it is not you who have made me\r\nwhat I am; it was love, which took me at the time when children only\r\nhave inclinations; it is the constancy natural to my character, which\r\nwith other creatures is but habit. I believed that I should always be as\r\nI was; I thought God had cast me in a path quite clear, quite straight,\r\nbordered with fruits and flowers. I had ever watching over me your\r\nvigilance and strength. I believed myself to be vigilant and strong.\r\nNothing prepared me; I fell once, and that once deprived me of courage\r\nfor the whole of my life. It is quite true that I wrecked myself. Oh,\r\nno, monsieur! you are nothing in my past but happiness--in my future but\r\nhope! No, I have no reproach to make against life such as you made it\r\nfor me; I bless you, and I love you ardently.”\r\n\r\n“My dear Raoul, your words do me good. They prove to me that you will\r\nact a little for me in the time to come.”\r\n\r\n“I shall only act for you, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Raoul, what I have never hitherto done with respect to you, I will\r\nhenceforward do. I will be your friend, not your father. We will live in\r\nexpanding ourselves, instead of living and holding ourselves prisoners,\r\nwhen you come back. And that will be soon, will it not?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, monsieur, for such an expedition cannot last long.”\r\n\r\n“Soon, then, Raoul, soon, instead of living moderately on my income, I\r\nwill give you the capital of my estates. It will suffice for launching\r\nyou into the world till my death; and you will give me, I hope, before\r\nthat time, the consolation of not seeing my race extinct.”\r\n\r\n“I will do all you may command,” said Raoul, much agitated.\r\n\r\n“It is not necessary, Raoul, that your duty as aide-de-camp should lead\r\nyou into too hazardous enterprises. You have gone through your ordeal;\r\nyou are known to be a true man under fire. Remember that war with Arabs\r\nis a war of snares, ambuscades, and assassinations.”\r\n\r\n“So it is said, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“There is never much glory in falling in an ambuscade. It is a death\r\nwhich always implies a little rashness or want of foresight. Often,\r\nindeed, he who falls in one meets with but little pity. Those who are\r\nnot pitied, Raoul, have died to little purpose. Still further, the\r\nconqueror laughs, and we Frenchmen ought not to allow stupid infidels to\r\ntriumph over our faults. Do you clearly understand what I am saying to\r\nyou, Raoul? God forbid I should encourage you to avoid encounters.”\r\n\r\n“I am naturally prudent, monsieur, and I have very good fortune,” said\r\nRaoul, with a smile which chilled the heart of his poor father; “for,”\r\n the young man hastened to add, “in twenty combats through which I have\r\nbeen, I have only received one scratch.”\r\n\r\n“There is in addition,” said Athos, “the climate to be dreaded: that is\r\nan ugly end, to die of fever! King Saint-Louis prayed God to send him an\r\narrow or the plague, rather than the fever.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, monsieur! with sobriety, with reasonable exercise--”\r\n\r\n“I have already obtained from M. de Beaufort a promise that his\r\ndispatches shall be sent off every fortnight to France. You, as his\r\naide-de-camp, will be charged with expediting them, and will be sure not\r\nto forget me.”\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur,” said Raoul, almost choked with emotion.\r\n\r\n“Besides, Raoul, as you are a good Christian, and I am one also, we\r\nought to reckon upon a more special protection of God and His guardian\r\nangels. Promise me that if anything evil should happen to you, on any\r\noccasion, you will think of me at once.”\r\n\r\n“First and at once! Oh! yes, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“And will call upon me?”\r\n\r\n“Instantly.”\r\n\r\n“You dream of me sometimes, do you not, Raoul?”\r\n\r\n“Every night, monsieur. During my early youth I saw you in my dreams,\r\ncalm and mild, with one hand stretched out over my head, and that it was\r\nwhich made me sleep so soundly--formerly.”\r\n\r\n“We love each other too dearly,” said the comte, “that from this moment,\r\nin which we separate, a portion of both our souls should not travel with\r\none and the other of us, and should not dwell wherever we may dwell.\r\nWhenever you may be sad, Raoul, I feel that my heart will be dissolved\r\nin sadness; and when you smile on thinking of me, be assured you will\r\nsend me, from however remote a distance, a vital scintillation of your\r\njoy.”\r\n\r\n“I will not promise you to be joyous,” replied the young man; “but you\r\nmay be certain that I will never pass an hour without thinking of you,\r\nnot one hour, I swear, unless I shall be dead.”\r\n\r\nAthos could contain himself no longer; he threw his arm round the neck\r\nof his son, and held him embraced with all the power of his heart. The\r\nmoon began to be now eclipsed by twilight; a golden band surrounded the\r\nhorizon, announcing the approach of the day. Athos threw his cloak over\r\nthe shoulders of Raoul, and led him back to the city, where burdens and\r\nporters were already in motion, like a vast ant-hill. At the extremity\r\nof the plateau which Athos and Bragelonne were quitting, they saw a dark\r\nshadow moving uneasily backwards and forwards, as if in indecision or\r\nashamed to be seen. It was Grimaud, who in his anxiety had tracked his\r\nmaster, and was there awaiting him.\r\n\r\n“Oh! my good Grimaud,” cried Raoul, “what do you want? You are come to\r\ntell us it is time to be gone, have you not?”\r\n\r\n“Alone?” said Grimaud, addressing Athos and pointing to Raoul in a tone\r\nof reproach, which showed to what an extent the old man was troubled.\r\n\r\n“Oh! you are right!” cried the comte. “No, Raoul shall not go alone; no,\r\nhe shall not be left alone in a strange land without some friendly hand\r\nto support him, some friendly heart to recall to him all he loved!”\r\n\r\n“I?” said Grimaud.\r\n\r\n“You, yes, you!” cried Raoul, touched to the inmost heart.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” said Athos, “you are very old, my good Grimaud.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better,” replied the latter, with an inexpressible depth of\r\nfeeling and intelligence.\r\n\r\n“But the embarkation is begun,” said Raoul, “and you are not prepared.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Grimaud, showing the keys of his trunks, mixed with those of\r\nhis young master.\r\n\r\n“But,” again objected Raoul, “you cannot leave monsieur le comte thus\r\nalone; monsieur le comte, whom you have never quitted?”\r\n\r\nGrimaud turned his diamond eyes upon Athos and Raoul, as if to measure\r\nthe strength of both. The comte uttered not a word.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le comte prefers my going,” said Grimaud.\r\n\r\n“I do,” said Athos, by an inclination of the head.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the drums suddenly rolled, and the clarions filled\r\nthe air with their inspiring notes. The regiments destined for the\r\nexpedition began to debouch from the city. They advanced to the number\r\nof five, each composed of forty companies. Royals marched first,\r\ndistinguished by their white uniform, faced with blue. The _ordonnance_\r\ncolors, quartered cross-wise, violet and dead leaf, with a sprinkling\r\nof golden _fleurs-de-lis_, left the white-colored flag, with its\r\n_fleur-de-lised_ cross, to dominate the whole. Musketeers at the wings,\r\nwith their forked sticks and their muskets on their shoulders; pikemen\r\nin the center, with their lances, fourteen feet in length, marched gayly\r\ntowards the transports, which carried them in detail to the ships. The\r\nregiments of Picardy, Navarre, Normandy, and Royal Vaisseau, followed\r\nafter. M. de Beaufort had known well how to select his troops. He\r\nhimself was seen closing the march with his staff--it would take a full\r\nhour before he could reach the sea. Raoul with Athos turned his steps\r\nslowly towards the beach, in order to take his place when the prince\r\nembarked. Grimaud, boiling with the ardor of a young man, superintended\r\nthe embarkation of Raoul’s baggage in the admiral’s vessel. Athos, with\r\nhis arm passed through that of the son he was about to lose, absorbed\r\nin melancholy meditation, was deaf to every noise around him. An officer\r\ncame quickly towards them to inform Raoul that M. de Beaufort was\r\nanxious to have him by his side.\r\n\r\n“Have the kindness to tell the prince,” said Raoul, “that I request he\r\nwill allow me this hour to enjoy the company of my father.”\r\n\r\n“No, no,” said Athos, “an aide-de-camp ought not thus to quit his\r\ngeneral. Please to tell the prince, monsieur, that the vicomte will join\r\nhim immediately.” The officer set off at a gallop.\r\n\r\n“Whether we part here or part there,” added the comte, “it is no less\r\na separation.” He carefully brushed the dust from his son’s coat, and\r\npassed his hand over his hair as they walked along. “But, Raoul,” said\r\nhe, “you want money. M. de Beaufort’s train will be splendid, and I am\r\ncertain it will be agreeable to you to purchase horses and arms, which\r\nare very dear things in Africa. Now, as you are not actually in the\r\nservice of the king or M. de Beaufort, and are simply a volunteer, you\r\nmust not reckon upon either pay or largesse. But I should not like you\r\nto want for anything at Gigelli. Here are two hundred pistoles; if you\r\nwould please me, Raoul, spend them.”\r\n\r\nRaoul pressed the hand of his father, and, at the turning of a street,\r\nthey saw M. de Beaufort, mounted on a magnificent white _genet_, which\r\nresponded by graceful curvets to the applause of the women of the city.\r\nThe duke called Raoul, and held out his hand to the comte. He spoke to\r\nhim for some time, with such a kindly expression that the heart of the\r\npoor father even felt a little comforted. It was, however, evident to\r\nboth father and son that their walk amounted to nothing less than a\r\npunishment. There was a terrible moment--that at which, on quitting the\r\nsands of the shore, the soldiers and sailors exchanged the last\r\nkisses with their families and friends; a supreme moment, in which,\r\nnotwithstanding the clearness of the heavens, the warmth of the sun, of\r\nthe perfumes of the air, and the rich life that was circulating in their\r\nveins, everything appeared black, everything bitter, everything created\r\ndoubts of Providence, nay, at the most, of God. It was customary for\r\nthe admiral and his suite to embark last; the cannon waited to announce,\r\nwith its formidable voice, that the leader had placed his foot on board\r\nhis vessel. Athos, forgetful of both the admiral and the fleet, and of\r\nhis own dignity as a strong man, opened his arms to his son, and pressed\r\nhim convulsively to his heart.\r\n\r\n“Accompany us on board,” said the duke, very much affected; “you will\r\ngain a good half-hour.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Athos, “my farewell has been spoken, I do not wish to voice a\r\nsecond.”\r\n\r\n“Then, vicomte, embark--embark quickly!” added the prince, wishing\r\nto spare the tears of these two men, whose hearts were bursting. And\r\npaternally, tenderly, very much as Porthos might have done, he took\r\nRaoul in his arms and placed him in the boat, the oars of which, at a\r\nsignal, immediately were dipped in the waves. He himself, forgetful of\r\nceremony, jumped into his boat, and pushed it off with a vigorous foot.\r\n“Adieu!” cried Raoul.\r\n\r\nAthos replied only by a sign, but he felt something burning on his hand:\r\nit was the respectful kiss of Grimaud--the last farewell of the faithful\r\ndog. This kiss given, Grimaud jumped from the step of the mole upon\r\nthe stem of a two-oared yawl, which had just been taken in tow by a\r\n_chaland_ served by twelve galley-oars. Athos seated himself on the\r\nmole, stunned, deaf, abandoned. Every instant took from him one of the\r\nfeatures, one of the shades of the pale face of his son. With his arms\r\nhanging down, his eyes fixed, his mouth open, he remained confounded\r\nwith Raoul--in one same look, in one same thought, in one same stupor.\r\nThe sea, by degrees, carried away boats and faces to that distance at\r\nwhich men become nothing but points,--loves, nothing but remembrances.\r\nAthos saw his son ascend the ladder of the admiral’s ship, he saw him\r\nlean upon the rail of the deck, and place himself in such a manner as\r\nto be always an object in the eye of his father. In vain the cannon\r\nthundered, in vain from the ship sounded the long and lordly tumult,\r\nresponded to by immense acclamations from the shore; in vain did the\r\nnoise deafen the ear of the father, the smoke obscured the cherished\r\nobject of his aspirations. Raoul appeared to him to the last moment; and\r\nthe imperceptible atom, passing from black to pale, from pale to white,\r\nfrom white to nothing, disappeared for Athos--disappeared very long\r\nafter, to all the eyes of the spectators, had disappeared both gallant\r\nships and swelling sails. Towards midday, when the sun devoured space,\r\nand scarcely the tops of the masts dominated the incandescent limit of\r\nthe sea, Athos perceived a soft aerial shadow rise, and vanish as soon\r\nas seen. This was the smoke of a cannon, which M. de Beaufort ordered to\r\nbe fired as a last salute to the coast of France. The point was buried\r\nin its turn beneath the sky, and Athos returned with slow and painful\r\nstep to his deserted hostelry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIV. Among Women.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan had not been able to hide his feelings from his friends\r\nso much as he would have wished. The stoical soldier, the impassive\r\nman-at-arms, overcome by fear and sad presentiments, had yielded, for\r\na few moments, to human weakness. When, therefore, he had silenced\r\nhis heart and calmed the agitation of his nerves, turning towards his\r\nlackey, a silent servant, always listening, in order to obey the more\r\npromptly:\r\n\r\n“Rabaud,” said he, “mind, we must travel thirty leagues a day.”\r\n\r\n“At your pleasure, captain,” replied Rabaud.\r\n\r\nAnd from that moment, D’Artagnan, accommodating his action to the pace\r\nof the horse, like a true centaur, gave up his thoughts to nothing--that\r\nis to say, to everything. He asked himself why the king had sent for\r\nhim back; why the Iron Mask had thrown the silver plate at the feet of\r\nRaoul. As to the first subject, the reply was negative; he knew right\r\nwell that the king’s calling him was from necessity. He still further\r\nknew that Louis XIV. must experience an imperious desire for a private\r\nconversation with one whom the possession of such a secret placed on a\r\nlevel with the highest powers of the kingdom. But as to saying exactly\r\nwhat the king’s wish was, D’Artagnan found himself completely at a loss.\r\nThe musketeer had no doubts, either, upon the reason which had urged the\r\nunfortunate Philippe to reveal his character and birth. Philippe, buried\r\nforever beneath a mask of steel, exiled to a country where the men\r\nseemed little more than slaves of the elements; Philippe, deprived\r\neven of the society of D’Artagnan, who had loaded him with honors and\r\ndelicate attentions, had nothing more to see than odious specters in\r\nthis world, and, despair beginning to devour him, he poured himself\r\nforth in complaints, in the belief that his revelations would raise up\r\nsome avenger for him. The manner in which the musketeer had been near\r\nkilling his two best friends, the destiny which had so strangely brought\r\nAthos to participate in the great state secret, the farewell of Raoul,\r\nthe obscurity of the future which threatened to end in a melancholy\r\ndeath; all this threw D’Artagnan incessantly back on lamentable\r\npredictions and forebodings, which the rapidity of his pace did not\r\ndissipate, as it used formerly to do. D’Artagnan passed from these\r\nconsiderations to the remembrance of the proscribed Porthos and Aramis.\r\nHe saw them both, fugitives, tracked, ruined--laborious architects of\r\nfortunes they had lost; and as the king called for his man of execution\r\nin hours of vengeance and malice, D’Artagnan trembled at the very\r\nidea of receiving some commission that would make his very soul bleed.\r\nSometimes, ascending hills, when the winded horse breathed hard from his\r\nred nostrils, and heaved his flanks, the captain, left to more freedom\r\nof thought, reflected on the prodigious genius of Aramis, a genius of\r\nacumen and intrigue, a match to which the Fronde and the civil war had\r\nproduced but twice. Soldier, priest, diplomatist; gallant, avaricious,\r\ncunning; Aramis had never taken the good things of this life except\r\nas stepping-stones to rise to giddier ends. Generous in spirit, if not\r\nlofty in heart, he never did ill but for the sake of shining even\r\nyet more brilliantly. Towards the end of his career, at the moment of\r\nreaching the goal, like the patrician Fuscus, he had made a false step\r\nupon a plank, and had fallen into the sea. But Porthos, good, harmless\r\nPorthos! To see Porthos hungry, to see Mousqueton without gold lace,\r\nimprisoned, perhaps; to see Pierrefonds, Bracieux, razed to the very\r\nstones, dishonored even to the timber,--these were so many poignant\r\ngriefs for D’Artagnan, and every time that one of these griefs struck\r\nhim, he bounded like a horse at the sting of a gadfly beneath the vaults\r\nof foliage where he has sought shady shelter from the burning sun. Never\r\nwas the man of spirit subjected to _ennui_, if his body was exposed to\r\nfatigue; never did the man of healthy body fail to find life light, if\r\nhe had something to engage his mind. D’Artagnan, riding fast, thinking\r\nas constantly, alighted from his horse in Pairs, fresh and tender in\r\nhis muscles as the athlete preparing for the gymnasium. The king did not\r\nexpect him so soon, and had just departed for the chase towards Meudon.\r\nD’Artagnan, instead of riding after the king, as he would formerly have\r\ndone, took off his boots, had a bath, and waited till his majesty\r\nshould return dusty and tired. He occupied the interval of five hours\r\nin taking, as people say, the air of the house, and in arming himself\r\nagainst all ill chances. He learned that the king, during the last\r\nfortnight, had been gloomy; that the queen-mother was ill and much\r\ndepressed; that Monsieur, the king’s brother, was exhibiting a\r\ndevotional turn; that Madame had the vapors; and that M. de Guiche was\r\ngone to one of his estates. He learned that M. Colbert was radiant; that\r\nM. Fouquet consulted a fresh physician every day, who still did not cure\r\nhim, and that his principal complaint was one which physicians do not\r\nusually cure, unless they are political physicians. The king, D’Artagnan\r\nwas told, behaved in the kindest manner to M. Fouquet, and did not allow\r\nhim to be ever out of his sight; but the surintendant, touched to the\r\nheart, like one of those fine trees a worm has punctured, was declining\r\ndaily, in spite of the royal smile, that sun of court trees. D’Artagnan\r\nlearned that Mademoiselle de la Vallière had become indispensable to the\r\nking; that the king, during his sporting excursions, if he did not take\r\nher with him, wrote to her frequently, no longer verses, but, which\r\nwas much worse, prose, and that whole pages at a time. Thus, as the\r\npolitical Pleiad of the day said, the _first king in the world_ was seen\r\ndescending from his horse _with an ardor beyond compare_, and on the\r\ncrown of his hat scrawling bombastic phrases, which M. de Saint-Aignan,\r\naide-de-camp in perpetuity, carried to La Vallière at the risk of\r\nfoundering his horses. During this time, deer and pheasants were left to\r\nthe free enjoyment of their nature, hunted so lazily that, it was said,\r\nthe art of venery ran great risk of degenerating at the court of France.\r\nD’Artagnan then thought of the wishes of poor Raoul, of that desponding\r\nletter destined for a woman who passed her life in hoping, and as\r\nD’Artagnan loved to philosophize a little occasionally, he resolved\r\nto profit by the absence of the king to have a minute’s talk with\r\nMademoiselle de la Vallière. This was a very easy affair; while the king\r\nwas hunting, Louise was walking with some other ladies in one of\r\nthe galleries of the Palais Royal, exactly where the captain of the\r\nmusketeers had some guards to inspect. D’Artagnan did not doubt that,\r\nif he could but open the conversation on Raoul, Louise might give him\r\ngrounds for writing a consolatory letter to the poor exile; and hope,\r\nor at least consolation for Raoul, in the state of heart in which he had\r\nleft him, was the sun, was life to two men, who were very dear to our\r\ncaptain. He directed his course, therefore, to the spot where he knew\r\nhe should find Mademoiselle de la Vallière. D’Artagnan found La Vallière\r\nthe center of the circle. In her apparent solitude, the king’s favorite\r\nreceived, like a queen, more, perhaps, than the queen, a homage of which\r\nMadame had been so proud, when all the king’s looks were directed to her\r\nand commanded the looks of the courtiers. D’Artagnan, although no squire\r\nof dames, received, nevertheless, civilities and attentions from the\r\nladies; he was polite, as a brave man always is, and his terrible\r\nreputation had conciliated as much friendship among the men as\r\nadmiration among the women. On seeing him enter, therefore, they\r\nimmediately accosted him; and, as is not unfrequently the case with fair\r\nladies, opened the attack by questions. “Where _had_ he been? What _had_\r\nbecome of him so long? Why had they not seen him as usual make his fine\r\nhorse curvet in such beautiful style, to the delight and astonishment of\r\nthe curious from the king’s balcony?”\r\n\r\nHe replied that he had just come from the land of oranges. This set all\r\nthe ladies laughing. Those were times in which everybody traveled, but\r\nin which, notwithstanding, a journey of a hundred leagues was a problem\r\noften solved by death.\r\n\r\n“From the land of oranges?” cried Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente. “From\r\nSpain?”\r\n\r\n“Eh! eh!” said the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“From Malta?” echoed Montalais.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ You are coming very near, ladies.”\r\n\r\n“Is it an island?” asked La Vallière.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” said D’Artagnan; “I will not give you the trouble of\r\nseeking any further; I come from the country where M. de Beaufort is, at\r\nthis moment, embarking for Algiers.”\r\n\r\n“Have you seen the army?” asked several warlike fair ones.\r\n\r\n“As plainly as I see you,” replied D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“And the fleet?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I saw everything.”\r\n\r\n“Have we any of us any friends there?” said Mademoiselle de\r\nTonnay-Charente, coldly, but in a manner to attract attention to a\r\nquestion that was not without its calculated aim.\r\n\r\n“Why,” replied D’Artagnan, “yes; there were M. de la Guillotiere, M. de\r\nManchy, M. de Bragelonne--”\r\n\r\nLa Vallière became pale. “M. de Bragelonne!” cried the perfidious\r\nAthenais. “Eh, what!--is he gone to the wars?--he!”\r\n\r\nMontalais trod on her toe, but all in vain.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what my opinion is?” continued she, addressing D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“No, mademoiselle; but I should like very much to know it.”\r\n\r\n“My opinion is, then, that all the men who go to this war are desperate,\r\ndesponding men, whom love has treated ill; and who go to try if they\r\ncannot find jet-complexioned women more kind than fair ones have been.”\r\n\r\nSome of the ladies laughed; La Vallière was evidently confused;\r\nMontalais coughed loud enough to waken the dead.\r\n\r\n“Mademoiselle,” interrupted D’Artagnan, “you are in error when you speak\r\nof black women at Gigelli; the women there have not jet faces; it is\r\ntrue they are not white--they are yellow.”\r\n\r\n“Yellow!” exclaimed the bevy of fair beauties.\r\n\r\n“Eh! do not disparage it. I have never seen a finer color to match with\r\nblack eyes and a coral mouth.”\r\n\r\n“So much the better for M. de Bragelonne,” said Mademoiselle de\r\nTonnay-Charente, with persistent malice. “He will make amends for his\r\nloss. Poor fellow!”\r\n\r\nA profound silence followed these words; and D’Artagnan had time to\r\nobserve and reflect that women--mild doves--treat each other more\r\ncruelly than tigers. But making La Vallière pale did not satisfy\r\nAthenais; she determined to make her blush likewise. Resuming the\r\nconversation without pause, “Do you know, Louise,” said she, “that there\r\nis a great sin on your conscience?”\r\n\r\n“What sin, mademoiselle?” stammered the unfortunate girl, looking round\r\nher for support, without finding it.\r\n\r\n“Eh!--why,” continued Athenais, “the poor young man was affianced to\r\nyou; he loved you; you cast him off.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that is a right which every honest woman has,” said Montalais, in\r\nan affected tone. “When we know we cannot constitute the happiness of a\r\nman, it is much better to cast him off.”\r\n\r\n“Cast him off! or refuse him!--that’s all very well,” said Athenais,\r\n“but that is not the sin Mademoiselle de la Vallière has to reproach\r\nherself with. The actual sin is sending poor Bragelonne to the wars; and\r\nto wars in which death is so very likely to be met with.” Louise pressed\r\nher hand over her icy brow. “And if he dies,” continued her pitiless\r\ntormentor, “you will have killed him. That is the sin.”\r\n\r\nLouise, half-dead, caught at the arm of the captain of the musketeers,\r\nwhose face betrayed unusual emotion. “You wished to speak with me,\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan,” said she, in a voice broken by anger and pain.\r\n“What had you to say to me?”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan made several steps along the gallery, holding Louise on his\r\narm; then, when they were far enough removed from the others--“What\r\nI had to say to you, mademoiselle,” replied he, “Mademoiselle de\r\nTonnay-Charente has just expressed; roughly and unkindly, it is true but\r\nstill in its entirety.”\r\n\r\nShe uttered a faint cry; pierced to the heart by this new wound, she\r\nwent her way, like one of those poor birds which, struck unto death,\r\nseek the shade of the thicket in which to die. She disappeared at one\r\ndoor, at the moment the king was entering by another. The first glance\r\nof the king was directed towards the empty seat of his mistress. Not\r\nperceiving La Vallière, a frown came over his brow; but as soon as he\r\nsaw D’Artagnan, who bowed to him--“Ah! monsieur!” cried he, “you _have_\r\nbeen diligent! I am much pleased with you.” This was the superlative\r\nexpression of royal satisfaction. Many men would have been ready to lay\r\ndown their lives for such a speech from the king. The maids of honor and\r\nthe courtiers, who had formed a respectful circle round the king on his\r\nentrance, drew back, on observing he wished to speak privately with\r\nhis captain of the musketeers. The king led the way out of the gallery,\r\nafter having again, with his eyes, sought everywhere for La Vallière,\r\nwhose absence he could not account for. The moment they were out of\r\nthe reach of curious ears, “Well! Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said he, “the\r\nprisoner?”\r\n\r\n“Is in his prison, sire.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say on the road?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, sire.”\r\n\r\n“What did he do?”\r\n\r\n“There was a moment at which the fisherman--who took me in his boat\r\nto Sainte-Marguerite--revolted, and did his best to kill me. The--the\r\nprisoner defended me instead of attempting to fly.”\r\n\r\nThe king became pale. “Enough!” said he; and D’Artagnan bowed. Louis\r\nwalked about his cabinet with hasty steps. “Were you at Antibes,” said\r\nhe, “when Monsieur de Beaufort came there?”\r\n\r\n“No, sire; I was setting off when monsieur le duc arrived.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” which was followed by a fresh silence. “Whom did you see there?”\r\n\r\n“A great many persons,” said D’Artagnan, coolly.\r\n\r\nThe king perceived he was unwilling to speak. “I have sent for you,\r\nmonsieur le capitaine, to desire you to go and prepare my lodgings at\r\nNantes.”\r\n\r\n“At Nantes!” cried D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“In Bretagne.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire, it is in Bretagne. Will you majesty make so long a journey\r\nas to Nantes?”\r\n\r\n“The States are assembled there,” replied the king. “I have two demands\r\nto make of them: I wish to be there.”\r\n\r\n“When shall I set out?” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“This evening--to-morrow--to-morrow evening; for you must stand in need\r\nof rest.”\r\n\r\n“I have rested, sire.”\r\n\r\n“That is well. Then between this and to-morrow evening, when you\r\nplease.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan bowed as if to take his leave; but, perceiving the king\r\nvery much embarrassed, “Will you majesty,” said he, stepping two paces\r\nforward, “take the court with you?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I shall.”\r\n\r\n“Then you majesty will, doubtless, want the musketeers?” And the eye of\r\nthe king sank beneath the penetrating glance of the captain.\r\n\r\n“Take a brigade of them,” replied Louis.\r\n\r\n“Is that all? Has your majesty no other orders to give me?”\r\n\r\n“No--ah--yes.”\r\n\r\n“I am all attention, sire.”\r\n\r\n“At the castle of Nantes, which I hear is very ill arranged, you will\r\nadopt the practice of placing musketeers at the door of each of the\r\nprincipal dignitaries I shall take with me.”\r\n\r\n“Of the principal?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“For instance, at the door of M. de Lyonne?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And that of M. Letellier?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Of M. de Brienne?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And of monsieur le surintendant?”\r\n\r\n“Without doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, sire. By to-morrow I shall have set out.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes; but one more word, Monsieur d’Artagnan. At Nantes you will\r\nmeet with M. le Duc de Gesvres, captain of the guards. Be sure that\r\nyour musketeers are placed before his guards arrive. Precedence always\r\nbelongs to the first comer.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“And if M. de Gesvres should question you?”\r\n\r\n“Question me, sire! Is it likely that M. de Gesvres should question\r\nme?” And the musketeer, turning cavalierly on his heel, disappeared. “To\r\nNantes!” said he to himself, as he descended from the stairs. “Why did\r\nhe not dare to say, from thence to Belle-Isle?”\r\n\r\nAs he reached the great gates, one of M. Brienne’s clerks came running\r\nafter him, exclaiming, “Monsieur d’Artagnan! I beg your pardon--”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, Monsieur Ariste?”\r\n\r\n“The king has desired me to give you this order.”\r\n\r\n“Upon your cash-box?” asked the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur; on that of M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan was surprised, but he took the order, which was in the king’s\r\nown writing, and was for two hundred pistoles. “What!” thought he, after\r\nhaving politely thanked M. Brienne’s clerk, “M. Fouquet is to pay for\r\nthe journey, then! _Mordioux!_ that is a bit of pure Louis XI. Why was\r\nnot this order on the chest of M. Colbert? He would have paid it with\r\nsuch joy.” And D’Artagnan, faithful to his principle of never letting\r\nan order at sight get cold, went straight to the house of M. Fouquet, to\r\nreceive his two hundred pistoles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV. The Last Supper.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent had no doubt received advice of the approaching\r\ndeparture, for he was giving a farewell dinner to his friends. From\r\nthe bottom to the top of the house, the hurry of the servants bearing\r\ndishes, and the diligence of the _registres_, denoted an approaching\r\nchange in offices and kitchen. D’Artagnan, with his order in his hand,\r\npresented himself at the offices, when he was told it was too late\r\nto pay cash, the chest was closed. He only replied: “On the king’s\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\nThe clerk, a little put out by the serious air of the captain, replied,\r\nthat “that was a very respectable reason, but that the customs of the\r\nhouse were respectable likewise; and that, in consequence, he begged the\r\nbearer to call again next day.” D’Artagnan asked if he could not see\r\nM. Fouquet. The clerk replied that M. le surintendant did not interfere\r\nwith such details, and rudely closed the outer door in the captain’s\r\nface. But the latter had foreseen this stroke, and placed his boot\r\nbetween the door and the door-case, so that the lock did not catch, and\r\nthe clerk was still nose to nose with his interlocutor. This made him\r\nchange his tone, and say, with terrified politeness, “If monsieur wishes\r\nto speak to M. le surintendant, he must go to the ante-chambers; these\r\nare the offices, where monseigneur never comes.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! very well! Where are they?” replied D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“On the other side of the court,” said the clerk, delighted to be free.\r\nD’Artagnan crossed the court, and fell in with a crowd of servants.\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur sees nobody at this hour,” he was answered by a fellow\r\ncarrying a vermeil dish, in which were three pheasants and twelve\r\nquails.\r\n\r\n“Tell him,” said the captain, laying hold of the servant by the end\r\nof his dish, “that I am M. d’Artagnan, captain of his majesty’s\r\nmusketeers.”\r\n\r\nThe fellow uttered a cry of surprise, and disappeared; D’Artagnan\r\nfollowing him slowly. He arrived just in time to meet M. Pelisson in\r\nthe ante-chamber: the latter, a little pale, came hastily out of the\r\ndining-room to learn what was the matter. D’Artagnan smiled.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing unpleasant, Monsieur Pelisson; only a little order to\r\nreceive the money for.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Fouquet’s friend, breathing more freely; and he took the\r\ncaptain by the hand, and, dragging him behind him, led him into the\r\ndining-room, where a number of friends surrounded the surintendant,\r\nplaced in the center, and buried in the cushions of a _fauteuil_. There\r\nwere assembled all the Epicureans who so lately at Vaux had done the\r\nhonors of the mansion of wit and money in aid of M. Fouquet. Joyous\r\nfriends, for the most part faithful, they had not fled their protector\r\nat the approach of the storm, and, in spite of the threatening heavens,\r\nin spite of the trembling earth, they remained there, smiling, cheerful,\r\nas devoted in misfortune as they had been in prosperity. On the left\r\nof the surintendant sat Madame de Belliere; on his right was Madame\r\nFouquet; as if braving the laws of the world, and putting all vulgar\r\nreasons of propriety to silence, the two protecting angels of this\r\nman united to offer, at the moment of the crisis, the support of\r\ntheir twined arms. Madame de Belliere was pale, trembling, and full of\r\nrespectful attentions for madame la surintendante, who, with one hand on\r\nher husband’s, was looking anxiously towards the door by which Pelisson\r\nhad gone out to bring D’Artagnan. The captain entered at first full\r\nof courtesy, and afterwards of admiration, when, with his infallible\r\nglance, he had divined as well as taken in the expression of every face.\r\nFouquet raised himself up in his chair.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said he, “if I did not myself receive\r\nyou when coming in the king’s name.” And he pronounced the last words\r\nwith a sort of melancholy firmness, which filled the hearts of all his\r\nfriends with terror.\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur,” replied D’Artagnan, “I only come to you in the king’s\r\nname to demand payment of an order for two hundred pistoles.”\r\n\r\nThe clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet, which still\r\nremained overcast.\r\n\r\n“Ah! then,” said he, “perhaps you also are setting out for Nantes?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know whither I am setting out, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Madame Fouquet, recovered from her fright, “you are not\r\ngoing so soon, monsieur le capitaine, as not to do us the honor to take\r\na seat with us?”\r\n\r\n“Madame, I should esteem that a great honor done me, but I am so\r\npressed for time, that, you see, I have been obliged to permit myself to\r\ninterrupt your repast to procure payment of my note.”\r\n\r\n“The reply to which shall be gold,” said Fouquet, making a sign to his\r\nintendant, who went out with the order D’Artagnan handed him.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said the latter, “I was not uneasy about the payment; the house is\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\nA painful smile passed over the pale features of Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Are you in pain?” asked Madame de Belliere.\r\n\r\n“Do you feel your attack coming on?” asked Madame Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Neither, thank you both,” said Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Your attack?” said D’Artagnan, in his turn; “are you unwell,\r\nmonseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“I have a tertian fever, which seized me after the _fete_ at Vaux.”\r\n\r\n“Caught cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“No, no; nothing but agitation, that was all.”\r\n\r\n“The too much heart you displayed in your reception of the king,”\r\n said La Fontaine, quietly, without suspicion that he was uttering a\r\nsacrilege.\r\n\r\n“We cannot devote too much heart to the reception of our king,” said\r\nFouquet, mildly, to his poet.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur meant to say the too great ardor,” interrupted D’Artagnan,\r\nwith perfect frankness and much amenity. “The fact is, monseigneur, that\r\nhospitality was never practiced as at Vaux.”\r\n\r\nMadame Fouquet permitted her countenance to show clearly that if Fouquet\r\nhad conducted himself well towards the king, the king had hardly done\r\nthe like to the minister. But D’Artagnan knew the terrible secret. He\r\nalone with Fouquet knew it; those two men had not, the one the courage\r\nto complain, the other the right to accuse. The captain, to whom the\r\ntwo hundred pistoles were brought, was about to take his leave, when\r\nFouquet, rising, took a glass of wine, and ordered one to be given to\r\nD’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he, “to the health of the king, _whatever may happen_.”\r\n\r\n“And to your health, monseigneur, _whatever may happen_,” said\r\nD’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nHe bowed, with these words of evil omen, to all the company, who rose as\r\nsoon as they heard the sound of his spurs and boots at the bottom of the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n“I, for a moment, thought it was I and not my money he wanted,” said\r\nFouquet, endeavoring to laugh.\r\n\r\n“You!” cried his friends; “and what for, in the name of Heaven!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! do not deceive yourselves, my dear brothers in Epicurus,” said the\r\nsuperintendent; “I do not wish to make a comparison between the most\r\nhumble sinner on the earth, and the God we adore, but remember, he gave\r\none day to his friends a repast which is called the Last Supper, and\r\nwhich was nothing but a farewell dinner, like that which we are making\r\nat this moment.”\r\n\r\nA painful cry of denial arose from all parts of the table. “Shut the\r\ndoors,” said Fouquet, and the servants disappeared. “My friends,”\r\n continued Fouquet, lowering his voice, “what was I formerly? What am\r\nI now? Consult among yourselves and reply. A man like me sinks when\r\nhe does not continue to rise. What shall we say, then, when he really\r\nsinks? I have no more money, no more credit; I have no longer anything\r\nbut powerful enemies, and powerless friends.”\r\n\r\n“Quick!” cried Pelisson. “Since you explain yourself with such\r\nfrankness, it is our duty to be frank, likewise. Yes, you are\r\nruined--yes, you are hastening to your ruin--stop. And, in the first\r\nplace, what money have we left?”\r\n\r\n“Seven hundred thousand livres,” said the intendant.\r\n\r\n“Bread,” murmured Madame Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Relays,” said Pelisson, “relays, and fly!”\r\n\r\n“Whither?”\r\n\r\n“To Switzerland--to Savoy--but fly!”\r\n\r\n“If monseigneur flies,” said Madame Belliere, “it will be said that he\r\nwas guilty--was afraid.”\r\n\r\n“More than that, it will be said that I have carried away twenty\r\nmillions with me.”\r\n\r\n“We will draw up memoirs to justify you,” said La Fontaine. “Fly!”\r\n\r\n“I will remain,” said Fouquet. “And, besides, does not everything serve\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“You have Belle-Isle,” cried the Abbe Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“And I am naturally going there, when going to Nantes,” replied the\r\nsuperintendent. “Patience, then, patience!”\r\n\r\n“Before arriving at Nantes, what a distance!” said Madame Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know that well,” replied Fouquet. “But what is to be done there?\r\nThe king summons me to the States. I know well it is for the purpose of\r\nruining me; but to refuse to go would be to evince uneasiness.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I have discovered the means of reconciling everything,” cried\r\nPelisson. “You are going to set out for Nantes.”\r\n\r\nFouquet looked at him with an air of surprise.\r\n\r\n“But with friends; but in your own carriage as far as Orleans; in your\r\nown barge as far as Nantes; always ready to defend yourself, if you are\r\nattacked; to escape, if you are threatened. In fact, you will carry your\r\nmoney against all chances; and, whilst flying, you will only have obeyed\r\nthe king; then, reaching the sea, when you like, you will embark for\r\nBelle-Isle, and from Belle-Isle you will shoot out wherever it may\r\nplease you, like the eagle that leaps into space when it has been driven\r\nfrom its eyrie.”\r\n\r\nA general assent followed Pelisson’s words. “Yes, do so,” said Madame\r\nFouquet to her husband.\r\n\r\n“Do so,” said Madame de Belliere.\r\n\r\n“Do it! do it!” cried all his friends.\r\n\r\n“I will do so,” replied Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“This very evening?”\r\n\r\n“In an hour?”\r\n\r\n“Instantly.”\r\n\r\n“With seven hundred thousand livres you can lay the foundation of\r\nanother fortune,” said the Abbe Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“What is there to prevent our arming corsairs at Belle-Isle?”\r\n\r\n“And, if necessary, we will go and discover a new world,” added La\r\nFontaine, intoxicated with fresh projects and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nA knock at the door interrupted this concert of joy and hope. “A courier\r\nfrom the king,” said the master of the ceremonies.\r\n\r\nA profound silence immediately ensued, as if the message brought by this\r\ncourier was nothing but a reply to all the projects given birth to a\r\nmoment before. Every one waited to see what the master would do. His\r\nbrow was streaming with perspiration, and he was really suffering from\r\nhis fever at that instant. He passed into his cabinet, to receive the\r\nking’s message. There prevailed, as we have said, such a silence in the\r\nchambers, and throughout the attendance, that from the dining-room could\r\nbe heard the voice of Fouquet, saying, “That is well, monsieur.” This\r\nvoice was, however, broken by fatigue, and trembled with emotion. An\r\ninstant after, Fouquet called Gourville, who crossed the gallery amidst\r\nthe universal expectation. At length, he himself re-appeared among his\r\nguests; but it was no longer the same pale, spiritless countenance they\r\nhad beheld when he left them; from pale he had become livid; and from\r\nspiritless, annihilated. A breathing, living specter, he advanced with\r\nhis arms stretched out, his mouth parched, like a shade that comes to\r\nsalute the friends of former days. On seeing him thus, every one cried\r\nout, and every one rushed towards Fouquet. The latter, looking at\r\nPelisson, leaned upon his wife, and pressed the icy hand of the Marquise\r\nde Belliere.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, in a voice which had nothing human in it.\r\n\r\n“What has happened, my God!” said some one to him.\r\n\r\nFouquet opened his right hand, which was clenched, but glistening\r\nwith perspiration, and displayed a paper, upon which Pelisson cast a\r\nterrified glance. He read the following lines, written by the king’s\r\nhand:\r\n\r\n“‘DEAR AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET,--Give us, upon that which you\r\nhave left of ours, the sum of seven hundred thousand livres, of which we\r\nstand in need to prepare for our departure.\r\n\r\n“‘And, as we know your health is not good, we pray God to restore you,\r\nand to have you in His holy keeping. “‘LOUIS.\r\n\r\n“‘The present letter is to serve as a receipt.’”\r\n\r\nA murmur of terror circulated through the apartment.\r\n\r\n“Well,” cried Pelisson, in his turn, “you have received that letter?”\r\n\r\n“Received it, yes!”\r\n\r\n“What will you do, then?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing, since I have received it.”\r\n\r\n“But--”\r\n\r\n“If I have received it, Pelisson, I have paid it,” said the\r\nsurintendant, with a simplicity that went to the heart of all present.\r\n\r\n“You have paid it!” cried Madame Fouquet. “Then we are ruined!”\r\n\r\n“Come, no useless words,” interrupted Pelisson. “Next to money, life.\r\nMonseigneur, to horse! to horse!”\r\n\r\n“What, leave us!” at once cried both the women, wild with grief.\r\n\r\n“Eh! monseigneur, in saving yourself, you save us all. To horse!”\r\n\r\n“But he cannot hold himself on. Look at him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! if he takes time to reflect--” said the intrepid Pelisson.\r\n\r\n“He is right,” murmured Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur! Monseigneur!” cried Gourville, rushing up the stairs, four\r\nsteps at once. “Monseigneur!”\r\n\r\n“Well! what?”\r\n\r\n“I escorted, as you desired, the king’s courier with the money.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well! when I arrived at the Palais Royal, I saw--”\r\n\r\n“Take breath, my poor friend, take breath; you are suffocating.”\r\n\r\n“What did you see?” cried the impatient friends.\r\n\r\n“I saw the musketeers mounting on horseback,” said Gourville.\r\n\r\n“There, then!” cried every voice at once; “there, then! is there an\r\ninstant to be lost?”\r\n\r\nMadame Fouquet rushed downstairs, calling for her horses; Madame de\r\nBelliere flew after her, catching her in her arms, and saying: “Madame,\r\nin the name of his safety, do not betray anything, do not manifest\r\nalarm.”\r\n\r\nPelisson ran to have the horses put to the carriages. And, in the\r\nmeantime, Gourville gathered in his hat all that the weeping friends\r\nwere able to throw into it of gold and silver--the last offering, the\r\npious alms made to misery by poverty. The surintendant, dragged along by\r\nsome, carried by others, was shut up in his carriage. Gourville took the\r\nreins, and mounted the box. Pelisson supported Madame Fouquet, who had\r\nfainted. Madame de Belliere had more strength, and was well paid for\r\nit; she received Fouquet’s last kiss. Pelisson easily explained this\r\nprecipitate departure by saying that an order from the king had summoned\r\nthe minister to Nantes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVI. In M. Colbert’s Carriage.\r\n\r\nAs Gourville had seen, the king’s musketeers were mounting and following\r\ntheir captain. The latter, who did not like to be confined in his\r\nproceedings, left his brigade under the orders of a lieutenant, and set\r\noff on post horses, recommending his men to use all diligence. However\r\nrapidly they might travel, they could not arrive before him. He had\r\ntime, in passing along the Rue des Petits-Champs, to see something\r\nwhich afforded him plenty of food for thought and conjecture. He saw M.\r\nColbert coming out from his house to get into his carriage, which was\r\nstationed before the door. In this carriage D’Artagnan perceived the\r\nhoods of two women, and being rather curious, he wished to know the\r\nnames of the ladies hid beneath these hoods. To get a glimpse at them,\r\nfor they kept themselves closely covered up, he urged his horse so near\r\nthe carriage, that he drove him against the step with such force as to\r\nshake everything containing and contained. The terrified women uttered,\r\nthe one a faint cry, by which D’Artagnan recognized a young woman, the\r\nother an imprecation, in which he recognized the vigor and _aplomb_ that\r\nhalf a century bestows. The hoods were thrown back: one of the women\r\nwas Madame Vanel, the other the Duchesse de Chevreuse. D’Artagnan’s\r\neyes were quicker than those of the ladies; he had seen and known them,\r\nwhilst they did not recognize him; and as they laughed at their fright,\r\npressing each other’s hands,--\r\n\r\n“Humph!” said D’Artagnan, “the old duchesse is no more inaccessible to\r\nfriendship than formerly. _She_ paying her court to the mistress of M.\r\nColbert! Poor M. Fouquet! that presages you nothing good!”\r\n\r\nHe rode on. M. Colbert got into his carriage and the distinguished trio\r\ncommenced a sufficiently slow pilgrimage toward the wood of Vincennes.\r\nMadame de Chevreuse set down Madame Vanel at her husband’s house, and,\r\nleft alone with M. Colbert, chatted upon affairs whilst continuing her\r\nride. She had an inexhaustible fund of conversation, that dear duchesse,\r\nand as she always talked for the ill of others, though ever with a view\r\nto her own good, her conversation amused her interlocutor, and did not\r\nfail to leave a favorable impression.\r\n\r\nShe taught Colbert, who, poor man! was ignorant of the fact, how great\r\na minister he was, and how Fouquet would soon become a cipher. She\r\npromised to rally around him, when he should become surintendant,\r\nall the old nobility of the kingdom, and questioned him as to the\r\npreponderance it would be proper to allow La Vallière. She praised him,\r\nshe blamed him, she bewildered him. She showed him the secret of so many\r\nsecrets that, for a moment, Colbert thought he was doing business with\r\nthe devil. She proved to him that she held in her hand the Colbert of\r\nto-day, as she had held the Fouquet of yesterday; and as he asked her\r\nvery simply the reason of her hatred for the surintendant: “Why do you\r\nyourself hate him?” said she.\r\n\r\n“Madame, in politics,” replied he, “the differences of system oft bring\r\nabout dissentions between men. M. Fouquet always appeared to me to\r\npractice a system opposed to the true interests of the king.”\r\n\r\nShe interrupted him.--“I will say no more to you about M. Fouquet. The\r\njourney the king is about to take to Nantes will give a good account of\r\nhim. M. Fouquet, for me, is a man gone by--and for you also.”\r\n\r\nColbert made no reply. “On his return from Nantes,” continued the\r\nduchesse, “the king, who is only anxious for a pretext, will find\r\nthat the States have not behaved well--that they have made too few\r\nsacrifices. The States will say that the imposts are too heavy, and that\r\nthe surintendant has ruined them. The king will lay all the blame on M.\r\nFouquet, and then--”\r\n\r\n“And then?” said Colbert.\r\n\r\n“Oh! he will be disgraced. Is not that your opinion?”\r\n\r\nColbert darted a glance at the duchesse, which plainly said: “If M.\r\nFouquet be only disgraced, you will not be the cause of it.”\r\n\r\n“Your place, M. Colbert,” the duchesse hastened to say, “must be a high\r\nplace. Do you perceive any one between the king and yourself, after the\r\nfall of M. Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“I do not understand,” said he.\r\n\r\n“You _will_ understand. To what does your ambition aspire?”\r\n\r\n“I have none.”\r\n\r\n“It was useless, then, to overthrow the superintendent, Monsieur\r\nColbert. It was idle.”\r\n\r\n“I had the honor to tell you, madame--”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes, I know, all about the interest of the king--but, if you\r\nplease, we will speak of your own.”\r\n\r\n“Mine! that is to say, the affairs of his majesty.”\r\n\r\n“In short, are you, or are you not endeavoring to ruin M. Fouquet?\r\nAnswer without evasion.”\r\n\r\n“Madame, I ruin nobody.”\r\n\r\n“I am endeavoring to comprehend, then, why you purchased from me the\r\nletters of M. Mazarin concerning M. Fouquet. Neither can I conceive why\r\nyou have laid those letters before the king.”\r\n\r\nColbert, half stupefied, looked at the duchesse with an air of\r\nconstraint.\r\n\r\n“Madame,” said he, “I can less easily conceive how you, who received the\r\nmoney, can reproach me on that head--”\r\n\r\n“That is,” said the old duchesse, “because we must will that which we\r\nwish for, unless we are not able to obtain what we wish.”\r\n\r\n“_Will!_” said Colbert, quite confounded by such coarse logic.\r\n\r\n“You are not able, _hein!_ Speak.”\r\n\r\n“I am not able, I allow, to destroy certain influences near the king.”\r\n\r\n“That fight in favor of M. Fouquet? What are they? Stop, let me help\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Do, madame.”\r\n\r\n“La Vallière?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! very little influence; no knowledge of business, and small means.\r\nM. Fouquet has paid his court to her.”\r\n\r\n“To defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?”\r\n\r\n“I think it would.”\r\n\r\n“There is still another influence, what do you say to that?”\r\n\r\n“Is it considerable?”\r\n\r\n“The queen-mother, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Her majesty, the queen-mother, has a weakness for M. Fouquet very\r\nprejudicial to her son.”\r\n\r\n“Never believe that,” said the old duchesse, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Colbert, with incredulity, “I have often experienced it.”\r\n\r\n“Formerly?”\r\n\r\n“Very recently, madame, at Vaux. It was she who prevented the king from\r\nhaving M. Fouquet arrested.”\r\n\r\n“People do not forever entertain the same opinions, my dear monsieur.\r\nThat which the queen may have wished recently, she would not wish,\r\nperhaps, to-day.”\r\n\r\n“And why not?” said Colbert, astonished.\r\n\r\n“Oh! the reason is of very little consequence.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I think it is of great consequence; for, if I were\r\ncertain of not displeasing her majesty, the queen-mother, my scruples\r\nwould be all removed.”\r\n\r\n“Well! have you never heard talk of a certain secret?”\r\n\r\n“A secret?”\r\n\r\n“Call it what you like. In short, the queen-mother has conceived a\r\nbitter hatred for all those who have participated, in one fashion or\r\nanother, in the discovery of this secret, and M. Fouquet I believe is\r\none of these.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Colbert, “we may be sure of the assent of the\r\nqueen-mother?”\r\n\r\n“I have just left her majesty, and she assures me so.”\r\n\r\n“So be it, then, madame.”\r\n\r\n“But there is something further; do you happen to know a man who was the\r\nintimate friend of M. Fouquet, M. d’Herblay, a bishop, I believe?”\r\n\r\n“Bishop of Vannes.”\r\n\r\n“Well! this M. d’Herblay, who also knew the secret, the queen-mother is\r\npursuing with the utmost rancor.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\n“So hotly pursued, that if he were dead, she would not be satisfied with\r\nanything less than his head, to satisfy her he would never speak again.”\r\n\r\n“And is that the desire of the queen-mother?”\r\n\r\n“An order is given for it.”\r\n\r\n“This Monsieur d’Herblay shall be sought for, madame.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! it is well known where he is.”\r\n\r\nColbert looked at the duchesse.\r\n\r\n“Say where, madame.”\r\n\r\n“He is at Belle-Ile-en-Mer.”\r\n\r\n“At the residence of M. Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“At the residence of M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\n“He shall be taken.”\r\n\r\nIt was now the duchesse’s turn to smile. “Do not fancy the capture so\r\neasy,” said she; “do not promise it so lightly.”\r\n\r\n“Why not, madame?”\r\n\r\n“Because M. d’Herblay is not one of those people who can be taken when\r\nand where you please.”\r\n\r\n“He is a rebel, then?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Monsieur Colbert, we have passed all our lives in making rebels,\r\nand yet you see plainly, that so far from being taken, we take others.”\r\n\r\nColbert fixed upon the old duchesse one of those fierce looks of which\r\nno words can convey the expression, accompanied by a firmness not\r\naltogether wanting in grandeur. “The times are gone,” said he, “in which\r\nsubjects gained duchies by making war against the king of France. If M.\r\nd’Herblay conspires, he will perish on the scaffold. That will give, or\r\nwill not give, pleasure to his enemies,--a matter, by the way, of little\r\nimportance to _us_.”\r\n\r\nAnd this _us_, a strange word in the mouth of Colbert, made the duchesse\r\nthoughtful for a moment. She caught herself reckoning inwardly with this\r\nman--Colbert had regained his superiority in the conversation, and he\r\nmeant to keep it.\r\n\r\n“You ask me, madame,” he said, “to have this M. d’Herblay arrested?”\r\n\r\n“I?--I ask you nothing of the kind!”\r\n\r\n“I thought you did, madame. But as I have been mistaken, we will leave\r\nhim alone; the king has said nothing about him.”\r\n\r\nThe duchesse bit her nails.\r\n\r\n“Besides,” continued Colbert, “what a poor capture would this bishop be!\r\nA bishop game for a king! Oh! no, no; I will not even take the slightest\r\nnotice of him.”\r\n\r\nThe hatred of the duchesse now discovered itself.\r\n\r\n“Game for a woman!” said she. “Is not the queen a woman? If she wishes\r\nM. d’Herblay arrested, she has her reasons. Besides, is not M. d’Herblay\r\nthe friend of him who is doomed to fall?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! never mind that,” said Colbert. “This man shall be spared, if he is\r\nnot the enemy of the king. Is that displeasing to you?”\r\n\r\n“I say nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Yes--you wish to see him in prison, in the Bastile, for instance.”\r\n\r\n“I believe a secret better concealed behind the walls of the Bastile\r\nthan behind those of Belle-Isle.”\r\n\r\n“I will speak to the king about it; he will clear up the point.”\r\n\r\n“And whilst waiting for that enlightenment, Monsieur l’Eveque de Vannes\r\nwill have escaped. I would do so.”\r\n\r\n“Escaped! he! and whither should he escape? Europe is ours, in will, if\r\nnot in fact.”\r\n\r\n“He will always find an asylum, monsieur. It is evident you know nothing\r\nof the man you have to do with. You do not know D’Herblay; you do not\r\nknow Aramis. He was one of those four musketeers who, under the late\r\nking, made Cardinal de Richelieu tremble, and who, during the regency,\r\ngave so much trouble to Monseigneur Mazarin.”\r\n\r\n“But, madame, what can he do, unless he has a kingdom to back him?”\r\n\r\n“He has one, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“A kingdom, he! what, Monsieur d’Herblay?”\r\n\r\n“I repeat to you, monsieur, that if he wants a kingdom, he either has it\r\nor will have it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, as you are so earnest that this rebel should not escape, madame,\r\nI promise you he shall not escape.”\r\n\r\n“Belle-Isle is fortified, M. Colbert, and fortified by him.”\r\n\r\n“If Belle-Isle were also defended by him, Belle-Isle is not impregnable;\r\nand if Monsieur l’Eveque de Vannes is shut up in Belle-Isle, well,\r\nmadame, the place shall be besieged, and he will be taken.”\r\n\r\n“You may be very certain, monsieur, that the zeal you display in the\r\ninterest of the queen-mother will please her majesty mightily, and\r\nyou will be magnificently rewarded; but what shall I tell her of your\r\nprojects respecting this man?”\r\n\r\n“That when once taken, he shall be shut up in a fortress from which her\r\nsecret shall never escape.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Monsieur Colbert, and we may say, that, dating from this\r\ninstant, we have formed a solid alliance, that is, you and I, and that I\r\nam absolutely at your service.”\r\n\r\n“It is I, madame, who place myself at yours. This Chevalier d’Herblay is\r\na kind of Spanish spy, is he not?”\r\n\r\n“Much more.”\r\n\r\n“A secret ambassador?”\r\n\r\n“Higher still.”\r\n\r\n“Stop--King Phillip III. of Spain is a bigot. He is, perhaps, the\r\nconfessor of Phillip III.”\r\n\r\n“You must go higher even than that.”\r\n\r\n“_Mordieu!_” cried Colbert, who forgot himself so far as to swear in the\r\npresence of this great lady, of this old friend of the queen-mother. “He\r\nmust then be the general of the Jesuits.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you have guessed it at last,” replied the duchesse.\r\n\r\n“Ah! then, madame, this man will ruin us all if we do not ruin him; and\r\nwe must make haste, too.”\r\n\r\n“Such was my opinion, monsieur, but I did not dare to give it you.”\r\n\r\n“And it was lucky for us he has attacked the throne, and not us.”\r\n\r\n“But, mark this well, M. Colbert. M. d’Herblay is never discouraged; if\r\nhe has missed one blow, he will be sure to make another; he will begin\r\nagain. If he has allowed an opportunity to escape of making a king for\r\nhimself, sooner or later, he will make another, of whom, to a certainty,\r\nyou will not be prime minister.”\r\n\r\nColbert knitted his brow with a menacing expression. “I feel assured\r\nthat a prison will settle this affair for us, madame, in a manner\r\nsatisfactory for both.”\r\n\r\nThe duchesse smiled again.\r\n\r\n“Oh! if you knew,” said she, “how many times Aramis has got out of\r\nprison!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” replied Colbert, “we will take care that he shall not get out\r\n_this_ time.”\r\n\r\n“But you were not attending to what I said to you just now. Do you\r\nremember that Aramis was one of the four invincibles whom Richelieu so\r\ndreaded? And at that period the four musketeers were not in possession\r\nof that which they have now--money and experience.”\r\n\r\nColbert bit his lips.\r\n\r\n“We will renounce the idea of the prison,” said he, in a lower tone:\r\n“we will find a little retreat from which the invincible cannot possibly\r\nescape.”\r\n\r\n“That was well spoken, our ally!” replied the duchesse. “But it is\r\ngetting late; had we not better return?”\r\n\r\n“The more willingly, madame, from my having my preparations to make for\r\nsetting out with the king.”\r\n\r\n“To Paris!” cried the duchesse to the coachman.\r\n\r\nAnd the carriage returned towards the Faubourg Saint Antoine, after the\r\nconclusion of the treaty that gave to death the last friend of Fouquet,\r\nthe last defender of Belle-Isle, the former friend of Marie Michon, the\r\nnew foe of the old duchesse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVII. The Two Lighters.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan had set off; Fouquet likewise was gone, and with a rapidity\r\nwhich doubled the tender interest of his friends. The first moments of\r\nthis journey, or better say, this flight, were troubled by a ceaseless\r\ndread of every horse and carriage to be seen behind the fugitive. It was\r\nnot natural, in fact, if Louis XIV. was determined to seize this prey,\r\nthat he should allow it to escape; the young lion was already accustomed\r\nto the chase, and he had bloodhounds sufficiently clever to be trusted.\r\nBut insensibly all fears were dispersed; the surintendant, by hard\r\ntraveling, placed such a distance between himself and his persecutors,\r\nthat no one of them could reasonably be expected to overtake him. As\r\nto his position, his friends had made it excellent for him. Was he not\r\ntraveling to join the king at Nantes, and what did the rapidity prove\r\nbut his zeal to obey? He arrived, fatigued, but reassured, at Orleans,\r\nwhere he found, thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him,\r\na handsome lighter of eight oars. These lighters, in the shape of\r\ngondolas, somewhat wide and heavy, containing a small chamber, covered\r\nby the deck, and a chamber in the poop, formed by a tent, then acted as\r\npassage-boats from Orleans to Nantes, by the Loire, and this passage,\r\na long one in our days, appeared then more easy and convenient than the\r\nhigh-road, with its post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages. Fouquet went\r\non board this lighter, which set out immediately. The rowers, knowing\r\nthey had the honor of conveying the surintendant of the finances, pulled\r\nwith all their strength, and that magic word, the _finances_, promised\r\nthem a liberal gratification, of which they wished to prove themselves\r\nworthy. The lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire.\r\nMagnificent weather, a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape,\r\ndisplayed the river in all its limpid serenity. The current and the\r\nrowers carried Fouquet along as wings carry a bird, and he arrived\r\nbefore Beaugency without the slightest accident having signalized the\r\nvoyage. Fouquet hoped to be the first to arrive at Nantes; there he\r\nwould see the notables and gain support among the principal members of\r\nthe States; he would make himself a necessity, a thing very easy for a\r\nman of his merit, and would delay the catastrophe, if he did not succeed\r\nin avoiding it entirely. “Besides,” said Gourville to him, “at Nantes,\r\nyou will make out, or we will make out, the intentions of your enemies;\r\nwe will have horses always ready to convey you to Poitou, a bark in\r\nwhich to gain the sea, and when once upon the open sea, Belle-Isle is\r\nyour inviolable port. You see, besides, that no one is watching you, no\r\none is following.” He had scarcely finished when they discovered at\r\na distance, behind an elbow formed by the river, the masts of a huge\r\nlighter coming down. The rowers of Fouquet’s boat uttered a cry of\r\nsurprise on seeing this galley.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“The matter is, monseigneur,” replied the patron of the bark, “that it\r\nis a truly remarkable thing--that lighter comes along like a hurricane.”\r\n\r\nGourville started, and mounted to the deck, in order to obtain a better\r\nview.\r\n\r\nFouquet did not go up with him, but said to Gourville, with restrained\r\nmistrust: “See what it is, dear friend.”\r\n\r\nThe lighter had just passed the elbow. It came on so fast, that behind\r\nit might be plainly seen the white wake illumined with the fires of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n“How they go,” repeated the skipper, “how they go! They must be well\r\npaid! I did not think,” he added, “that oars of wood could behave better\r\nthan ours, but yonder oarsmen prove the contrary.”\r\n\r\n“Well they may,” said one of the rowers, “they are twelve, and we but\r\neight.”\r\n\r\n“Twelve rowers!” replied Gourville, “twelve! impossible.”\r\n\r\nThe number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded, even\r\nfor the king. This honor had been paid to monsieur le surintendant, more\r\nfor the sake of haste than of respect.\r\n\r\n“What does it mean?” said Gourville, endeavoring to distinguish beneath\r\nthe tent, which was already apparent, travelers which the most piercing\r\neye could not yet have succeeded in discovering.\r\n\r\n“They must be in a hurry, for it is not the king,” said the patron.\r\n\r\nFouquet shuddered.\r\n\r\n“By what sign do you know that it is not the king?” said Gourville.\r\n\r\n“In the first place, because there is no white flag with fleurs-de-lis,\r\nwhich the royal lighter always carries.”\r\n\r\n“And then,” said Fouquet, “because it is impossible it should be the\r\nking, Gourville, as the king was still in Paris yesterday.”\r\n\r\nGourville replied to the surintendant by a look which said: “You were\r\nthere yourself yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“And by what sign do you make out they are in such haste?” added he, for\r\nthe sake of gaining time.\r\n\r\n“By this, monsieur,” said the patron; “these people must have set out a\r\nlong while after us, and they have already nearly overtaken us.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said Gourville, “who told you that they do not come from\r\nBeaugency or from Moit even?”\r\n\r\n“We have seen no lighter of that shape, except at Orleans. It comes from\r\nOrleans, monsieur, and makes great haste.”\r\n\r\nFouquet and Gourville exchanged a glance. The captain remarked their\r\nuneasiness, and, to mislead him, Gourville immediately said:\r\n\r\n“Some friend, who has laid a wager he would catch us; let us win the\r\nwager, and not allow him to come up with us.”\r\n\r\nThe patron opened his mouth to say that it was quite impossible, but\r\nFouquet said with much _hauteur_,--“If it is any one who wishes to\r\novertake us, let him come.”\r\n\r\n“We can try, monseigneur,” said the man, timidly. “Come, you fellows,\r\nput out your strength; row, row!”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Fouquet, “on the contrary; stop short.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur! what folly!” interrupted Gourville, stooping towards his\r\near.\r\n\r\n“Pull up!” repeated Fouquet. The eight oars stopped, and resisting the\r\nwater, created a retrograde motion. It stopped. The twelve rowers in the\r\nother did not, at first, perceive this maneuver, for they continued\r\nto urge on their boat so vigorously that it arrived quickly within\r\nmusket-shot. Fouquet was short-sighted, Gourville was annoyed by the\r\nsun, now full in his eyes; the skipper alone, with that habit and\r\nclearness which are acquired by a constant struggle with the elements,\r\nperceived distinctly the travelers in the neighboring lighter.\r\n\r\n“I can see them!” cried he; “there are two.”\r\n\r\n“I can see nothing,” said Gourville.\r\n\r\n“You will not be long before you distinguish them; in twenty strokes of\r\ntheir oars they will be within ten paces of us.”\r\n\r\nBut what the patron announced was not realized; the lighter imitated\r\nthe movement commanded by Fouquet, and instead of coming to join its\r\npretended friends, it stopped short in the middle of the river.\r\n\r\n“I cannot comprehend this,” said the captain.\r\n\r\n“Nor I,” cried Gourville.\r\n\r\n“You who can see so plainly the people in that lighter,” resumed\r\nFouquet, “try to describe them to us, before we are too far off.”\r\n\r\n“I thought I saw two,” replied the boatman. “I can only see one now,\r\nunder the tent.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of man is he?”\r\n\r\n“He is a dark man, broad-shouldered, bull-necked.”\r\n\r\nA little cloud at that moment passed across the azure, darkening the\r\nsun. Gourville, who was still looking, with one hand over his eyes,\r\nbecame able to see what he sought, and all at once, jumping from the\r\ndeck into the chamber where Fouquet awaited him: “Colbert!” said he, in\r\na voice broken by emotion.\r\n\r\n“Colbert!” repeated Fouquet. “Too strange! but no, it is impossible!”\r\n\r\n“I tell you I recognized him, and he, at the same time, so plainly\r\nrecognized me, that he is just gone into the chamber on the poop.\r\nPerhaps the king has sent him on our track.”\r\n\r\n“In that case he would join us, instead of lying by. What is he doing\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\n“He is watching us, without a doubt.”\r\n\r\n“I do not like uncertainty,” said Fouquet; “let us go straight up to\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! monseigneur, do not do that, the lighter is full of armed men.”\r\n\r\n“He wishes to arrest me, then, Gourville? Why does he not come on?”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, it is not consistent with your dignity to go to meet even\r\nyour ruin.”\r\n\r\n“But to allow them to watch me like a malefactor!”\r\n\r\n“Nothing yet proves that they are watching you, monseigneur; be\r\npatient!”\r\n\r\n“What is to be done, then?”\r\n\r\n“Do not stop; you were only going so fast to appear to obey the king’s\r\norder with zeal. Redouble the speed. He who lives will see!”\r\n\r\n“That is better. Come!” cried Fouquet; “since they remain stock-still\r\nyonder, let us go on.”\r\n\r\nThe captain gave the signal, and Fouquet’s rowers resumed their task\r\nwith all the success that could be looked for from men who had rested.\r\nScarcely had the lighter made a hundred fathoms, than the other, that\r\nwith the twelve rowers, resumed its rapid course. This position lasted\r\nall day, without any increase or diminution of distance between the two\r\nvessels. Towards evening Fouquet wished to try the intentions of his\r\npersecutor. He ordered his rowers to pull towards the shore, as if to\r\neffect a landing. Colbert’s lighter imitated this maneuver, and steered\r\ntowards the shore in a slanting direction. By the merest chance, at\r\nthe spot where Fouquet pretended to wish to land, a stableman, from\r\nthe chateau of Langeais, was following the flowery banks leading three\r\nhorses in halters. Without doubt the people of the twelve-oared lighter\r\nfancied that Fouquet was directing his course to these horses ready\r\nfor flight, for four or five men, armed with muskets, jumped from the\r\nlighter on to the shore, and marched along the banks, as if to gain\r\nground on the horseman. Fouquet, satisfied of having forced the enemy to\r\na demonstration, considered his intention evident, and put his boat\r\nin motion again. Colbert’s people returned likewise to theirs, and the\r\ncourse of the two vessels was resumed with fresh perseverance. Upon\r\nseeing this, Fouquet felt himself threatened closely, and in a prophetic\r\nvoice--“Well, Gourville,” said he, whisperingly, “what did I say at our\r\nlast repast, at my house? Am I going, or not, to my ruin?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! monseigneur!”\r\n\r\n“These two boats, which follow each other with so much emulation, as if\r\nwe were disputing, M. Colbert and I, a prize for swiftness on the\r\nLoire, do they not aptly represent our fortunes; and do you not believe,\r\nGourville, that one of the two will be wrecked at Nantes?”\r\n\r\n“At least,” objected Gourville, “there is still uncertainty; you are\r\nabout to appear at the States; you are about to show what sort of man\r\nyou are; your eloquence and genius for business are the buckler and\r\nsword that will serve to defend you, if not to conquer with. The Bretons\r\ndo not know you; and when they become acquainted with you your cause\r\nis won! Oh! let M. Colbert look to it well, for his lighter is as much\r\nexposed as yours to being upset. Both go quickly, his faster than yours,\r\nit is true; we shall see which will be wrecked first.”\r\n\r\nFouquet, taking Gourville’s hand--“My friend,” said he, “everything\r\nconsidered, remember the proverb, ‘First come, first served!’ Well! M.\r\nColbert takes care not to pass me. He is a prudent man is M. Colbert.”\r\n\r\nHe was right; the two lighters held their course as far as Nantes,\r\nwatching each other. When the surintendant landed, Gourville hoped he\r\nshould be able to seek refuge at once, and have the relays prepared.\r\nBut, at the landing, the second lighter joined the first, and Colbert,\r\napproaching Fouquet, saluted him on the quay with marks of the\r\nprofoundest respect--marks so significant, so public, that their result\r\nwas the bringing of the whole population upon La Fosse. Fouquet was\r\ncompletely self-possessed; he felt that in his last moments of greatness\r\nhe had obligations towards himself. He wished to fall from such a height\r\nthat his fall should crush some of his enemies. Colbert was there--so\r\nmuch the worse for Colbert. The surintendant, therefore, coming up to\r\nhim, replied, with that arrogant semi-closure of the eyes peculiar to\r\nhim--“What! is that you, M. Colbert?”\r\n\r\n“To offer you my respects, monseigneur,” said the latter.\r\n\r\n“Were you in that lighter?”--pointing to the one with twelve rowers.\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Of twelve rowers?” said Fouquet; “what luxury, M. Colbert. For a moment\r\nI thought it was the queen-mother.”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur!”--and Colbert blushed.\r\n\r\n“This is a voyage that will cost those who have to pay for it\r\ndear, Monsieur l’Intendant!” said Fouquet. “But you have, happily,\r\narrived!--You see, however,” added he, a moment after, “that I, who had\r\nbut eight rowers, arrived before you.” And he turned his back towards\r\nhim, leaving him uncertain whether the maneuvers of the second lighter\r\nhad escaped the notice of the first. At least he did not give him\r\nthe satisfaction of showing that he had been frightened. Colbert, so\r\nannoyingly attacked, did not give way.\r\n\r\n“I have not been quick, monseigneur,” he replied, “because I followed\r\nyour example whenever you stopped.”\r\n\r\n“And why did you do that, Monsieur Colbert?” cried Fouquet, irritated by\r\nthe base audacity; “as you had a superior crew to mine, why did you not\r\neither join me or pass me?”\r\n\r\n“Out of respect,” said the intendant, bowing to the ground.\r\n\r\nFouquet got into a carriage which the city had sent to him, we know not\r\nwhy or how, and he repaired to _la Maison de Nantes_, escorted by a vast\r\ncrowd of people, who for several days had been agog with expectation of\r\na convocation of the States. Scarcely was he installed when Gourville\r\nwent out to order horses on the route to Poitiers and Vannes, and a boat\r\nat Paimboef. He performed these various operations with so much mystery,\r\nactivity, and generosity, that never was Fouquet, then laboring under an\r\nattack of fever, more nearly saved, except for the counteraction of that\r\nimmense disturber of human projects,--chance. A report was spread during\r\nthe night, that the king was coming in great haste on post horses, and\r\nwould arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest. The people, while\r\nwaiting for the king, were greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers, newly\r\narrived, with Monsieur d’Artagnan, their captain, and quartered in the\r\ncastle, of which they occupied all the posts, in quality of guard of\r\nhonor. M. d’Artagnan, who was very polite, presented himself, about\r\nten o’clock, at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful\r\ncompliments; and although the minister suffered from fever, although\r\nhe was in such pain as to be bathed in sweat, he would receive M.\r\nd’Artagnan, who was delighted with that honor, as will be seen by the\r\nconversation they had together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXVIII. Friendly Advice.\r\n\r\nFouquet had gone to bed, like a man who clings to life, and wishes to\r\neconomize, as much as possible, that slender tissue of existence, of\r\nwhich the shocks and frictions of this world so quickly wear out the\r\ntenuity. D’Artagnan appeared at the door of this chamber, and was\r\nsaluted by the superintendent with a very affable “Good day.”\r\n\r\n“_Bon jour!_ monseigneur,” replied the musketeer; “how did you get\r\nthrough the journey?”\r\n\r\n“Tolerably well, thank you.”\r\n\r\n“And the fever?”\r\n\r\n“But poorly. I drink, as you perceive. I am scarcely arrived, and I have\r\nalready levied a contribution of _tisane_ upon Nantes.”\r\n\r\n“You should sleep first, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! _corbleu!_ my dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, I should be very glad to\r\nsleep.”\r\n\r\n“Who hinders you?”\r\n\r\n“Why, _you_ in the first place.”\r\n\r\n“I? Oh, monseigneur!”\r\n\r\n“No doubt you do. Is it at Nantes as at Paris? Do you not come in the\r\nking’s name?”\r\n\r\n“For Heaven’s sake, monseigneur,” replied the captain, “leave the king\r\nalone! The day on which I shall come on the part of the king, for the\r\npurpose you mean, take my word for it, I will not leave you long in\r\ndoubt. You will see me place my hand on my sword, according to the\r\n_ordonnance_, and you will hear my say at once, in ceremonial voice,\r\n‘Monseigneur, in the name of the king, I arrest you!’”\r\n\r\n“You promise me that frankness?” said the superintendent.\r\n\r\n“Upon my honor! But we have not come to that, believe me.”\r\n\r\n“What makes you think that, M. d’Artagnan? For my part, I think quite\r\nthe contrary.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard speak of nothing of the kind,” replied D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Eh! eh!” said Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, no. You are an agreeable man, in spite of your fever. The king\r\nshould not, cannot help loving you, at the bottom of his heart.”\r\n\r\nFouquet’s expression implied doubt. “But M. Colbert?” said he; “does M.\r\nColbert love me as much as you say?”\r\n\r\n“I am not speaking of M. Colbert,” replied D’Artagnan. “He is an\r\nexceptional man. He does not love you; so much is very possible; but,\r\n_mordioux!_ the squirrel can guard himself against the adder with very\r\nlittle trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know that you are speaking to me quite as a friend?” replied\r\nFouquet; “and that, upon my life! I have never met with a man of your\r\nintelligence, and heart?”\r\n\r\n“You are pleased to say so,” replied D’Artagnan. “Why did you wait till\r\nto-day to pay me such a compliment?”\r\n\r\n“Blind that we are!” murmured Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Your voice is getting hoarse,” said D’Artagnan; “drink, monseigneur,\r\ndrink!” And he offered him a cup of _tisane_, with the most friendly\r\ncordiality; Fouquet took it, and thanked him by a gentle smile. “Such\r\nthings only happen to me,” said the musketeer. “I have passed ten years\r\nunder your very beard, while you were rolling about tons of gold. You\r\nwere clearing an annual pension of four millions; you never observed me;\r\nand you find out there is such a person in the world, just at the moment\r\nyou--”\r\n\r\n“Just at the moment I am about to fall,” interrupted Fouquet. “That is\r\ntrue, my dear Monsieur d’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“I did not say so.”\r\n\r\n“But you thought so; and that is the same thing. Well! if I fall,\r\ntake my word as truth, I shall not pass a single day without saying\r\nto myself, as I strike my brow, ‘Fool! fool!--stupid mortal! You had a\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan under your eye and hand, and you did not employ him,\r\nyou did not enrich him!’”\r\n\r\n“You overwhelm me,” said the captain. “I esteem you greatly.”\r\n\r\n“There exists another man, then, who does not think as M. Colbert\r\nthinks,” said the surintendant.\r\n\r\n“How this M. Colbert looms up in your imagination! He is worse than\r\nfever!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I have good cause,” said Fouquet. “Judge for yourself.” And he\r\nrelated the details of the course of the lighters, and the hypocritical\r\npersecution of Colbert. “Is not this a clear sign of my ruin?”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan became very serious. “That is true,” he said. “Yes; it has\r\nan unsavory odor, as M. de Treville used to say.” And he fixed on M.\r\nFouquet his intelligent and significant look.\r\n\r\n“Am I not clearly designated in that, captain? Is not the king bringing\r\nme to Nantes to get me away from Paris, where I have so many creatures,\r\nand to possess himself of Belle-Isle?”\r\n\r\n“Where M. d’Herblay is,” added D’Artagnan. Fouquet raised his head. “As\r\nfor me, monseigneur,” continued D’Artagnan, “I can assure you the king\r\nhas said nothing to me against you.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\n“The king commanded me to set out for Nantes, it is true; and to say\r\nnothing about it to M. de Gesvres.”\r\n\r\n“My friend.”\r\n\r\n“To M. de Gesvres, yes, monseigneur,” continued the musketeer, whose eye\r\ns did not cease to speak a language different from the language of his\r\nlips. “The king, moreover, commanded me to take a brigade of musketeers,\r\nwhich is apparently superfluous, as the country is quite quiet.”\r\n\r\n“A brigade!” said Fouquet, raising himself upon his elbow.\r\n\r\n“Ninety-six horsemen, yes, monseigneur. The same number as were employed\r\nin arresting MM. de Chalais, de Cinq-Mars, and Montmorency.”\r\n\r\nFouquet pricked up his ears at these words, pronounced without apparent\r\nvalue. “And what else?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Oh! nothing but insignificant orders; such as guarding the castle,\r\nguarding every lodging, allowing none of M. de Gesvres’s guards to\r\noccupy a single post.”\r\n\r\n“And as to myself,” cried Fouquet, “what orders had you?”\r\n\r\n“As to you, monseigneur?--not the smallest word.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan, my safety, my honor, perhaps my life are at stake.\r\nYou would not deceive me?”\r\n\r\n“I?--to what end? Are you threatened? Only there really is an order with\r\nrespect to carriages and boats--”\r\n\r\n“An order?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but it cannot concern you--a simple measure of police.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, captain?--what is it?”\r\n\r\n“To forbid all horses or boats to leave Nantes, without a pass, signed\r\nby the king.”\r\n\r\n“Great God! but--”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan began to laugh. “All that is not to be put into execution\r\nbefore the arrival of the king at Nantes. So that you see plainly,\r\nmonseigneur, the order in nowise concerns you.”\r\n\r\nFouquet became thoughtful, and D’Artagnan feigned not to observe his\r\npreoccupation. “It is evident, by my thus confiding to you the orders\r\nwhich have been given to me, that I am friendly towards you, and that I\r\nam trying to prove to you that none of them are directed against you.”\r\n\r\n“Without doubt!--without doubt!” said Fouquet, still absent.\r\n\r\n“Let us recapitulate,” said the captain, his glance beaming with\r\nearnestness. “A special guard about the castle, in which your lodging is\r\nto be, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the castle?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! monseigneur, a regular prison! The absence of M. de Gesvres, who\r\nhas the honor of being one of your friends. The closing of the gates of\r\nthe city, and of the river without a pass; but, only when the king shall\r\nhave arrived. Please to observe, Monsieur Fouquet, that if, instead of\r\nspeaking to man like you, who are one of the first in the kingdom, I\r\nwere speaking to a troubled, uneasy conscience--I should compromise\r\nmyself forever. What a fine opportunity for any one who wished to be\r\nfree! No police, no guards, no orders; the water free, the roads free,\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan obliged to lend his horses, if required. All this\r\nought to reassure you, Monsieur Fouquet, for the king would not have\r\nleft me thus independent, if he had any sinister designs. In truth,\r\nMonsieur Fouquet, ask me whatever you like, I am at your service; and,\r\nin return, if you will consent to do it, do me a service, that of giving\r\nmy compliments to Aramis and Porthos, in case you embark for Belle-Isle,\r\nas you have a right to do without changing your dress, immediately, in\r\nyour _robe de chambre_--just as you are.” Saying these words, and with\r\na profound bow, the musketeer, whose looks had lost none of their\r\nintelligent kindness, left the apartment. He had not reached the steps\r\nof the vestibule, when Fouquet, quite beside himself, hung to the\r\nbell-rope, and shouted, “My horses!--my lighter!” But nobody answered.\r\nThe surintendant dressed himself with everything that came to hand.\r\n\r\n“Gourville!--Gourville!” cried he, while slipping his watch into\r\nhis pocket. And the bell sounded again, whilst Fouquet repeated,\r\n“Gourville!--Gourville!”\r\n\r\nGourville at length appeared, breathless and pale.\r\n\r\n“Let us be gone! Let us be gone!” cried Fouquet, as soon as he saw him.\r\n\r\n“It is too late!” said the surintendant’s poor friend.\r\n\r\n“Too late!--why?”\r\n\r\n“Listen!” And they heard the sounds of trumpets and drums in front of\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\n“What does that mean, Gourville?”\r\n\r\n“It means the king is come, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“The king!”\r\n\r\n“The king, who has ridden double stages, who has killed horses, and who\r\nis eight hours in advance of all our calculations.”\r\n\r\n“We are lost!” murmured Fouquet. “Brave D’Artagnan, all is over, thou\r\nhas spoken to me too late!”\r\n\r\nThe king, in fact, was entering the city, which soon resounded with the\r\ncannon from the ramparts, and from a vessel which replied from the lower\r\nparts of the river. Fouquet’s brow darkened; he called his _valets de\r\nchambre_ and dressed in ceremonial costume. From his window, behind the\r\ncurtains, he could see the eagerness of the people, and the movement of\r\na large troop, which had followed the prince. The king was conducted\r\nto the castle with great pomp, and Fouquet saw him dismount under the\r\nportcullis, and say something in the ear of D’Artagnan, who held his\r\nstirrup. D’Artagnan, when the king had passed under the arch, directed\r\nhis steps towards the house Fouquet was in; but so slowly, and stopping\r\nso frequently to speak to his musketeers, drawn up like a hedge, that\r\nit might be said he was counting the seconds, or the steps, before\r\naccomplishing his object. Fouquet opened the window to speak to him in\r\nthe court.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” cried D’Artagnan, on perceiving him, “are you still there,\r\nmonseigneur?”\r\n\r\nAnd that word _still_ completed the proof to Fouquet of how much\r\ninformation and how many useful counsels were contained in the first\r\nvisit the musketeer had paid him. The surintendant sighed deeply.\r\n“Good heavens! yes, monsieur,” replied he. “The arrival of the king has\r\ninterrupted me in the projects I had formed.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, then you know that the king has arrived?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur, I have seen him; and this time you come from him--”\r\n\r\n“To inquire after you, monseigneur; and, if your health is not too bad,\r\nto beg you to have the kindness to repair to the castle.”\r\n\r\n“Directly, Monsieur d’Artagnan, directly!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, _mordioux!_” said the captain, “now the king is come, there is no\r\nmore walking for anybody--no more free will; the password governs all\r\nnow, you as much as me, me as much as you.”\r\n\r\nFouquet heaved a last sigh, climbed with difficulty into his carriage,\r\nso great was his weakness, and went to the castle, escorted by\r\nD’Artagnan, whose politeness was not less terrifying this time than it\r\nhad just before been consoling and cheerful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIX. How the King, Louis XIV., Played His Little Part.\r\n\r\nAs Fouquet was alighting from his carriage, to enter the castle of\r\nNantes, a man of mean appearance went up to him with marks of the\r\ngreatest respect, and gave him a letter. D’Artagnan endeavored to\r\nprevent this man from speaking to Fouquet, and pushed him away, but the\r\nmessage had been given to the surintendant. Fouquet opened the letter\r\nand read it, and instantly a vague terror, which D’Artagnan did not\r\nfail to penetrate, was painted on the countenance of the first minister.\r\nFouquet put the paper into the portfolio which he had under his arm, and\r\npassed on towards the king’s apartments. D’Artagnan, through the small\r\nwindows made at every landing of the donjon stairs, saw, as he went up\r\nbehind Fouquet, the man who had delivered the note, looking round him\r\non the place and making signs to several persons, who disappeared in the\r\nadjacent streets, after having themselves repeated the signals. Fouquet\r\nwas made to wait for a moment on the terrace of which we have spoken,--a\r\nterrace which abutted on the little corridor, at the end of which the\r\ncabinet of the king was located. Here D’Artagnan passed on before the\r\nsurintendant, whom, till that time, he had respectfully accompanied, and\r\nentered the royal cabinet.\r\n\r\n“Well?” asked Louis XIV., who, on perceiving him, threw on to the table\r\ncovered with papers a large green cloth.\r\n\r\n“The order is executed, sire.”\r\n\r\n“And Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le surintendant follows me,” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“In ten minutes let him be introduced,” said the king, dismissing\r\nD’Artagnan again with a gesture. The latter retired; but had scarcely\r\nreached the corridor at the extremity of which Fouquet was waiting for\r\nhim, when he was recalled by the king’s bell.\r\n\r\n“Did he not appear astonished?” asked the king.\r\n\r\n“Who, sire?”\r\n\r\n“_Fouquet_,” replied the king, without saying monsieur, a peculiarity\r\nwhich confirmed the captain of the musketeers in his suspicions.\r\n\r\n“No, sire,” replied he.\r\n\r\n“That’s well!” And a second time Louis dismissed D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nFouquet had not quitted the terrace where he had been left by his guide.\r\nHe reperused his note, conceived thus:\r\n\r\n“Something is being contrived against you. Perhaps they will not dare to\r\ncarry it out at the castle; it will be on your return home. The house\r\nis already surrounded by musketeers. Do not enter. A white horse is in\r\nwaiting for you behind the esplanade!”\r\n\r\nFouquet recognized the writing and zeal of Gourville. Not being willing\r\nthat, if any evil happened to himself, this paper should compromise a\r\nfaithful friend, the surintendant was busy tearing it into a thousand\r\nmorsels, spread about by the wind from the balustrade of the terrace.\r\nD’Artagnan found him watching the snowflake fluttering of the last\r\nscraps in space.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he, “the king awaits you.”\r\n\r\nFouquet walked with a deliberate step along the little corridor, where\r\nMM. de Brienne and Rose were at work, whilst the Duc de Saint-Aignan,\r\nseated on a chair, likewise in the corridor, appeared to be waiting\r\nfor orders, with feverish impatience, his sword between his legs. It\r\nappeared strange to Fouquet that MM. Brienne, Rose, and de Saint-Aignan,\r\nin general so attentive and obsequious, should scarcely take the least\r\nnotice, as he, the surintendant, passed. But how could he expect to find\r\nit otherwise among courtiers, he whom the king no longer called anything\r\nbut _Fouquet?_ He raised his head, determined to look every one and\r\neverything bravely in the face, and entered the king’s apartment, where\r\na little bell, which we already know, had already announced him to his\r\nmajesty.\r\n\r\nThe king, without rising, nodded to him, and with interest: “Well! how\r\nare you, Monsieur Fouquet?” said he.\r\n\r\n“I am in a high fever,” replied the surintendant; “but I am at the\r\nking’s service.”\r\n\r\n“That is well; the States assemble to-morrow; have you a speech ready?”\r\n\r\nFouquet looked at the king with astonishment. “I have not, sire,”\r\n replied he; “but I will improvise one. I am too well acquainted with\r\naffairs to feel any embarrassment. I have only one question to ask; will\r\nyour majesty permit me?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. Ask it.”\r\n\r\n“Why did not your majesty do his first minister the honor of giving him\r\nnotice of this in Paris?”\r\n\r\n“You were ill; I was not willing to fatigue you.”\r\n\r\n“Never did a labor--never did an explanation fatigue me, sire; and since\r\nthe moment is come for me to demand an explanation of my king--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Monsieur Fouquet! an explanation? An explanation, pray, of what?”\r\n\r\n“Of your majesty’s intentions with respect to myself.”\r\n\r\nThe king blushed. “I have been calumniated,” continued Fouquet, warmly,\r\n“and I feel called upon to adjure the justice of the king to make\r\ninquiries.”\r\n\r\n“You say all this to me very uselessly, Monsieur Fouquet; I know what I\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty can only know the things that have been told to you; and\r\nI, on my part, have said nothing to you, whilst others have spoken many,\r\nmany times--”\r\n\r\n“What do you wish to say?” said the king, impatient to put an end to\r\nthis embarrassing conversation.\r\n\r\n“I will go straight to the facts, sire; and I accuse a certain man of\r\nhaving injured me in your majesty’s opinion.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody has injured you, Monsieur Fouquet.”\r\n\r\n“That reply proves to me, sire, that I am right.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Fouquet, I do not like people to be accused.”\r\n\r\n“Not when one is accused?”\r\n\r\n“We have already spoken too much about this affair.”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty will not allow me to justify myself?”\r\n\r\n“I repeat that I do not accuse you.”\r\n\r\nFouquet, with a half-bow, made a step backward. “It is certain,” thought\r\nhe, “that he has made up his mind. He alone who cannot go back can show\r\nsuch obstinacy. Not to see the danger now would be to be blind indeed;\r\nnot to shun it would be stupid.” He resumed aloud, “Did your majesty\r\nsend for me on business?”\r\n\r\n“No, Monsieur Fouquet, but for some advice I wish to give you.”\r\n\r\n“I respectfully await it, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Rest yourself, Monsieur Fouquet, do not throw away your strength; the\r\nsession of the States will be short, and when my secretaries shall\r\nhave closed it, I do not wish business to be talked of in France for a\r\nfortnight.”\r\n\r\n“Has the king nothing to say to me on the subject of this assembly of\r\nthe States?”\r\n\r\n“No, Monsieur Fouquet.”\r\n\r\n“Not to me, the surintendant of the finances?”\r\n\r\n“Rest yourself, I beg you; that is all I have to say to you.”\r\n\r\nFouquet bit his lips and hung his head. He was evidently busy with\r\nsome uneasy thought. This uneasiness struck the king. “Are you angry at\r\nhaving to rest yourself, M. Fouquet?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire, I am not accustomed to take rest.”\r\n\r\n“But you are ill; you must take care of yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty spoke just now of a speech to be pronounced to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nHis majesty made no reply; this unexpected stroke embarrassed him.\r\nFouquet felt the weight of this hesitation. He thought he could\r\nread danger in the eyes of the young prince, which fear would but\r\nprecipitate. “If I appear frightened, I am lost,” thought he.\r\n\r\nThe king, on his part, was only uneasy at the alarm of Fouquet. “Has he\r\na suspicion of anything?” murmured he.\r\n\r\n“If his first word is severe,” again thought Fouquet; “if he becomes\r\nangry, or feigns to be angry for the sake of a pretext, how shall I\r\nextricate myself? Let us smooth the declivity a little. Gourville was\r\nright.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said he, suddenly, “since the goodness of the king watches over\r\nmy health to the point of dispensing with my labor, may I not be allowed\r\nto be absent from the council of to-morrow? I could pass the day in\r\nbed, and will entreat the king to grant me his physician, that we may\r\nendeavor to find a remedy against this fearful fever.”\r\n\r\n“So be it, Monsieur Fouquet, it shall be as you desire; you shall have\r\na holiday to-morrow, you shall have the physician, and shall be restored\r\nto health.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks!” said Fouquet, bowing. Then, opening his game: “Shall I\r\nnot have the happiness of conducting your majesty to my residence of\r\nBelle-Isle?”\r\n\r\nAnd he looked Louis full in the face, to judge of the effect of such a\r\nproposal. The king blushed again.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” replied he, endeavoring to smile, “that you have just\r\nsaid, ‘My residence of Belle-Isle’?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Well! do you not remember,” continued the king in the same cheerful\r\ntone, “that you gave me Belle-Isle?”\r\n\r\n“That is true again, sire. Only, as you have not taken it, you will\r\ndoubtless come with me and take possession of it.”\r\n\r\n“I mean to do so.”\r\n\r\n“That was, besides, your majesty’s intention as well as mine; and I\r\ncannot express to your majesty how happy and proud I have been to see\r\nall the king’s regiments from Paris to help take possession.”\r\n\r\nThe king stammered out that he did not bring the musketeers for that\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am convinced of that,” said Fouquet, warmly; “your majesty knows\r\nvery well that you have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in\r\nyour hand, to bring to the ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle.”\r\n\r\n“_Peste!_” cried the king; “I do not wish those fine fortifications,\r\nwhich cost so much to build, to fall at all. No, let them stand against\r\nthe Dutch and English. You would not guess what I want to see at\r\nBelle-Isle, Monsieur Fouquet; it is the pretty peasants and women of\r\nthe lands on the sea-shore, who dance so well, and are so seducing\r\nwith their scarlet petticoats! I have heard great boast of your pretty\r\ntenants, monsieur le surintendant; well, let me have a sight of them.”\r\n\r\n“Whenever your majesty pleases.”\r\n\r\n“Have you any means of transport? It shall be to-morrow, if you like.”\r\n\r\nThe surintendant felt this stroke, which was not adroit, and replied,\r\n“No, sire; I was ignorant of your majesty’s wish; above all, I was\r\nignorant of your haste to see Belle-Isle, and I am prepared with\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\n“You have a boat of your own, nevertheless?”\r\n\r\n“I have five; but they are all in port, or at Paimboeuf; and to join\r\nthem, or bring them hither, would require at least twenty-four hours.\r\nHave I any occasion to send a courier? Must I do so?”\r\n\r\n“Wait a little, put an end to the fever,--wait till to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“That is true. Who knows but that by to-morrow we may not have a hundred\r\nother ideas?” replied Fouquet, now perfectly convinced and very pale.\r\n\r\nThe king started, and stretched his hand out towards his little bell,\r\nbut Fouquet prevented his ringing.\r\n\r\n“Sire,” said he, “I have an ague--I am trembling with cold. If I remain\r\na moment longer, I shall most likely faint. I request your majesty’s\r\npermission to go and fling myself beneath the bedclothes.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, you are in a shiver; it is painful to behold! Come, Monsieur\r\nFouquet, begone! I will send to inquire after you.”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty overwhelms me with kindness. In an hour I shall be\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\n“I will call some one to reconduct you,” said the king.\r\n\r\n“As you please, sire; I would gladly take the arm of any one.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried the king, ringing his little bell.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sire,” interrupted Fouquet, laughing in such a manner as made the\r\nprince feel cold, “would you give me the captain of your musketeers to\r\ntake me to my lodgings? An equivocal honor that, sire! A simple footman,\r\nI beg.”\r\n\r\n“And why, M. Fouquet? M. d’Artagnan conducts me often, and extremely\r\nwell!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but when he conducts you, sire, it is to obey you; whilst me--”\r\n\r\n“Go on!”\r\n\r\n“If I am obliged to return home supported by the leader of the\r\nmusketeers, it would be everywhere said you had had me arrested.”\r\n\r\n“Arrested!” replied the king, who became paler than Fouquet\r\nhimself,--“arrested! oh!”\r\n\r\n“And why should they not say so?” continued Fouquet, still laughing;\r\n“and I would lay a wager there would be people found wicked enough to\r\nlaugh at it.” This sally disconcerted the monarch. Fouquet was skillful\r\nenough, or fortunate enough, to make Louis XIV. recoil before the\r\nappearance of the deed he meditated. M. d’Artagnan, when he appeared,\r\nreceived an order to desire a musketeer to accompany the surintendant.\r\n\r\n“Quite unnecessary,” said the latter; “sword for sword; I prefer\r\nGourville, who is waiting for me below. But that will not prevent me\r\nenjoying the society of M. d’Artagnan. I am glad he will see Belle-Isle,\r\nhe is so good a judge of fortifications.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan bowed, without at all comprehending what was going on.\r\nFouquet bowed again and left the apartment, affecting all the slowness\r\nof a man who walks with difficulty. When once out of the castle, “I am\r\nsaved!” said he. “Oh! yes, disloyal king, you shall see Belle-Isle, but\r\nit shall be when I am no longer there.”\r\n\r\nHe disappeared, leaving D’Artagnan with the king.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said the king, “you will follow M. Fouquet at the distance of\r\na hundred paces.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“He is going to his lodgings again. You will go with him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“You will arrest him in my name, and will shut him up in a carriage.”\r\n\r\n“In a carriage. Well, sire?”\r\n\r\n“In such a fashion that he may not, on the road, either converse with\r\nany one or throw notes to people he may meet.”\r\n\r\n“That will be rather difficult, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, sire, I cannot stifle M. Fouquet, and if he asks for liberty\r\nto breathe, I cannot prevent him by closing both the windows and\r\nthe blinds. He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes\r\npossible.”\r\n\r\n“The case is provided for, Monsieur d’Artagnan; a carriage with a\r\ntrellis will obviate both the difficulties you point out.”\r\n\r\n“A carriage with an iron trellis!” cried D’Artagnan; “but a carriage\r\nwith an iron trellis is not made in half an hour, and your majesty\r\ncommands me to go immediately to M. Fouquet’s lodgings.”\r\n\r\n“The carriage in question is already made.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that is quite a different thing,” said the captain; “if the\r\ncarriage is ready made, very well, then, we have only to set it in\r\nmotion.”\r\n\r\n“It is ready--and the horses harnessed.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“And the coachman, with the outriders, is waiting in the lower court of\r\nthe castle.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan bowed. “There only remains for me to ask your majesty whither\r\nI shall conduct M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\n“To the castle of Angers, at first.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Afterwards we will see.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan, one last word: you have remarked that, for making\r\nthis capture of M. Fouquet, I have not employed my guards, on which\r\naccount M. de Gesvres will be furious.”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty does not employ your guards,” said the captain, a little\r\nhumiliated, “because you mistrust M. de Gesvres, that is all.”\r\n\r\n“That is to say, monsieur, that I have more confidence in you.”\r\n\r\n“I know that very well, sire! and it is of no use to make so much of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“It is only for the sake of arriving at this, monsieur, that if, from\r\nthis moment, it should happen that by any chance whatever M. Fouquet\r\nshould escape--such chances have been, monsieur--”\r\n\r\n“Oh! very often, sire; but for others, not for me.”\r\n\r\n“And why not with you?”\r\n\r\n“Because I, sire, have, for an instant, wished to save M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\nThe king started. “Because,” continued the captain, “I had then a right\r\nto do so, having guessed your majesty’s plan, without you having spoken\r\nto me of it, and that I took an interest in M. Fouquet. Now, was I not\r\nat liberty to show my interest in this man?”\r\n\r\n“In truth, monsieur, you do not reassure me with regard to your\r\nservices.”\r\n\r\n“If I had saved him then, I should have been perfectly innocent; I will\r\nsay more, I should have done well, for M. Fouquet is not a bad man. But\r\nhe was not willing; his destiny prevailed; he let the hour of liberty\r\nslip by. So much the worse! Now I have orders, I will obey those orders,\r\nand M. Fouquet you may consider as a man arrested. He is at the castle\r\nof Angers, this very M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you have not got him yet, captain.”\r\n\r\n“That concerns me; every one to his trade, sire; only, once more,\r\nreflect! Do you seriously give me orders to arrest M. Fouquet, sire?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, a thousand times, yes!”\r\n\r\n“In writing, sire, then.”\r\n\r\n“Here is the order.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan read it, bowed to the king, and left the room. From the\r\nheight of the terrace he perceived Gourville, who went by with a joyous\r\nair towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XL: The White Horse and the Black.\r\n\r\n“That is rather surprising,” said D’Artagnan; “Gourville running about\r\nthe streets so gayly, when he is almost certain that M. Fouquet is in\r\ndanger; when it is almost equally certain that it was Gourville who\r\nwarned M. Fouquet just now by the note which was torn into a thousand\r\npieces upon the terrace, and given to the winds by monsieur le\r\nsurintendant. Gourville is rubbing his hands; that is because he has\r\ndone something clever. Whence comes M. Gourville? Gourville is coming\r\nfrom the Rue aux Herbes. Whither does the Rue aux Herbes lead?” And\r\nD’Artagnan followed, along the tops of the houses of Nantes, dominated\r\nby the castle, the line traced by the streets, as he would have done\r\nupon a topographical plan; only, instead of the dead, flat paper, the\r\nliving chart rose in relief with the cries, the movements, and the\r\nshadows of men and things. Beyond the inclosure of the city, the great\r\nverdant plains stretched out, bordering the Loire, and appeared to run\r\ntowards the pink horizon, which was cut by the azure of the waters and\r\nthe dark green of the marshes. Immediately outside the gates of Nantes\r\ntwo white roads were seen diverging like separate fingers of a gigantic\r\nhand. D’Artagnan, who had taken in all the panorama at a glance by\r\ncrossing the terrace, was led by the line of the Rue aux Herbes to\r\nthe mouth of one of those roads which took its rise under the gates of\r\nNantes. One step more, and he was about to descend the stairs, take\r\nhis trellised carriage, and go towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet. But\r\nchance decreed, at the moment of plunging into the staircase, that he\r\nwas attracted by a moving point then gaining ground upon that road.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” said the musketeer to himself; “a horse galloping,--a\r\nrunaway horse, no doubt. What a rate he is going at!” The moving point\r\nbecame detached from the road, and entered into the fields. “A white\r\nhorse,” continued the captain, who had just observed the color thrown\r\nluminously against the dark ground, “and he is mounted; it must be some\r\nboy whose horse is thirsty and has run away with him.”\r\n\r\nThese reflections, rapid as lightning, simultaneous with visual\r\nperception, D’Artagnan had already forgotten when he descended the\r\nfirst steps of the staircase. Some morsels of paper were spread over the\r\nstairs, and shone out white against the dirty stones. “Eh! eh!” said the\r\ncaptain to himself, “here are some of the fragments of the note torn by\r\nM. Fouquet. Poor man! he has given his secret to the wind; the wind will\r\nhave no more to do with it, and brings it back to the king. Decidedly,\r\nFouquet, you play with misfortune! the game is not a fair one,--fortune\r\nis against you. The star of Louis XIV. obscures yours; the adder is\r\nstronger and more cunning than the squirrel.” D’Artagnan picked up one\r\nof these morsels of paper as he descended. “Gourville’s pretty little\r\nhand!” cried he, whilst examining one of the fragments of the note; “I\r\nwas not mistaken.” And he read the word “horse.” “Stop!” said he; and he\r\nexamined another, upon which there was not a letter traced. Upon a third\r\nhe read the word “white;” “white horse,” repeated he, like a child that\r\nis spelling. “Ah, _mordioux!_” cried the suspicious spirit, “a white\r\nhorse!” And, like that grain of powder which, burning, dilates into\r\nten thousand times its volume, D’Artagnan, enlightened by ideas and\r\nsuspicions, rapidly reascended the stairs towards the terrace. The\r\nwhite horse was still galloping in the direction of the Loire, at the\r\nextremity of which, melting into the vapors of the water, a little\r\nsail appeared, wave-balanced like a water-butterfly. “Oh!” cried the\r\nmusketeer, “only a man who wants to fly would go at that pace across\r\nplowed lands; there is but one Fouquet, a financier, to ride thus in\r\nopen day upon a white horse; there is no one but the lord of Belle-Isle\r\nwho would make his escape towards the sea, while there are such thick\r\nforests on land, and there is but one D’Artagnan in the world to catch\r\nM. Fouquet, who has half an hour’s start, and who will have gained his\r\nboat within an hour.” This being said, the musketeer gave orders that\r\nthe carriage with the iron trellis should be taken immediately to a\r\nthicket situated just outside the city. He selected his best horse,\r\njumped upon his back, galloped along the Rue aux Herbes, taking, not the\r\nroad Fouquet had taken, but the bank itself of the Loire, certain\r\nthat he should gain ten minutes upon the total distance, and, at the\r\nintersection of the two lines, come up with the fugitive, who could have\r\nno suspicion of being pursued in that direction. In the rapidity of the\r\npursuit, and with the impatience of the avenger, animating himself as in\r\nwar, D’Artagnan, so mild, so kind towards Fouquet, was surprised to find\r\nhimself become ferocious--almost sanguinary. For a long time he galloped\r\nwithout catching sight of the white horse. His rage assumed fury, he\r\ndoubted himself,--he suspected that Fouquet had buried himself in some\r\nsubterranean road, or that he had changed the white horse for one of\r\nthose famous black ones, as swift as the wind, which D’Artagnan, at\r\nSaint-Mande, had so frequently admired and envied for their vigor and\r\ntheir fleetness.\r\n\r\nAt such moments, when the wind cut his eyes so as to make the tears\r\nspring from them, when the saddle had become burning hot, when the\r\ngalled and spurred horse reared with pain, and threw behind him a shower\r\nof dust and stones, D’Artagnan, raising himself in his stirrups, and\r\nseeing nothing on the waters, nothing beneath the trees, looked up into\r\nthe air like a madman. He was losing his senses. In the paroxysms of\r\neagerness he dreamt of aerial ways,--the discovery of the following century;\r\nhe called to his mind Daedalus and the vast wings that had saved him\r\nfrom the prisons of Crete. A hoarse sigh broke from his lips, as he\r\nrepeated, devoured by the fear of ridicule, “I! I! duped by a Gourville!\r\nI! They will say that I am growing old,--they will say I have received a\r\nmillion to allow Fouquet to escape!” And he again dug his spurs into the\r\nsides of his horse: he had ridden astonishingly fast. Suddenly, at the\r\nextremity of some open pasture-ground, behind the hedges, he saw a white\r\nform which showed itself, disappeared, and at last remained distinctly\r\nvisible against the rising ground. D’Artagnan’s heart leaped with joy.\r\nHe wiped the streaming sweat from his brow, relaxed the tension of his\r\nknees,--by which the horse breathed more freely,--and, gathering up his\r\nreins, moderated the speed of the vigorous animal, his active accomplice\r\non this man-hunt. He had then time to study the direction of the\r\nroad, and his position with regard to Fouquet. The superintendent had\r\ncompletely winded his horse by crossing the soft ground. He felt the\r\nnecessity of gaining a firmer footing, and turned towards the road by\r\nthe shortest secant line. D’Artagnan, on his part, had nothing to do but\r\nto ride straight on, concealed by the sloping shore; so that he would\r\ncut his quarry off the road when he came up with him. Then the real race\r\nwould begin,--then the struggle would be in earnest.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan gave his horse good breathing-time. He observed that the\r\nsuperintendent had relaxed into a trot, which was to say, he, too, was\r\nfavoring his horse. But both of them were too much pressed for time to\r\nallow them to continue long at that pace. The white horse sprang off\r\nlike an arrow the moment his feet touched firm ground. D’Artagnan\r\ndropped his head, and his black horse broke into a gallop. Both followed\r\nthe same route; the quadruple echoes of this new race-course were\r\nconfounded. Fouquet had not yet perceived D’Artagnan. But on issuing\r\nfrom the slope, a single echo struck the air; it was that of the steps\r\nof D’Artagnan’s horse, which rolled along like thunder. Fouquet turned\r\nround, and saw behind him, within a hundred paces, his enemy bent over\r\nthe neck of his horse. There could be no doubt--the shining baldrick,\r\nthe red cassock--it was a musketeer. Fouquet slackened his hand\r\nlikewise, and the white horse placed twenty feet more between his\r\nadversary and himself.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but,” thought D’Artagnan, becoming very anxious, “that is not\r\na common horse M. Fouquet is upon--let us see!” And he attentively\r\nexamined with his infallible eye the shape and capabilities of the\r\ncourser. Round full quarters--a thin long tail--large hocks--thin legs,\r\nas dry as bars of steel--hoofs hard as marble. He spurred his own, but\r\nthe distance between the two remained the same. D’Artagnan listened\r\nattentively; not a breath of the horse reached him, and yet he seemed\r\nto cut the air. The black horse, on the contrary, began to puff like any\r\nblacksmith’s bellows.\r\n\r\n“I must overtake him, if I kill my horse,” thought the musketeer; and he\r\nbegan to saw the mouth of the poor animal, whilst he buried the rowels\r\nof his merciless spurs into his sides. The maddened horse gained twenty\r\ntoises, and came up within pistol-shot of Fouquet.\r\n\r\n“Courage!” said the musketeer to himself, “courage! the white horse will\r\nperhaps grow weaker, and if the horse does not fall, the master must\r\npull up at last.” But horse and rider remained upright together, gaining\r\nground by difficult degrees. D’Artagnan uttered a wild cry, which made\r\nFouquet turn round, and added speed to the white horse.\r\n\r\n“A famous horse! a mad rider!” growled the captain. “Hola! _mordioux!_\r\nMonsieur Fouquet! stop! in the king’s name!” Fouquet made no reply.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear me?” shouted D’Artagnan, whose horse had just stumbled.\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_” replied Fouquet, laconically; and rode on faster.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan was nearly mad; the blood rushed boiling to his temples and\r\nhis eyes. “In the king’s name!” cried he again, “stop, or I will bring\r\nyou down with a pistol-shot!”\r\n\r\n“Do!” replied Fouquet, without relaxing his speed.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan seized a pistol and cocked it, hoping that the double click\r\nof the spring would stop his enemy. “You have pistols likewise,” said\r\nhe, “turn and defend yourself.”\r\n\r\nFouquet did turn round at the noise, and looking D’Artagnan full in the\r\nface, opened, with his right hand, the part of his dress which concealed\r\nhis body, but he did not even touch his holsters. There were not more\r\nthan twenty paces between the two.\r\n\r\n“_Mordioux!_” said D’Artagnan, “I will not assassinate you; if you will\r\nnot fire upon me, surrender! what is a prison?”\r\n\r\n“I would rather die!” replied Fouquet; “I shall suffer less.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, drunk with despair, hurled his pistol to the ground. “I\r\nwill take you alive!” said he; and by a prodigy of skill which this\r\nincomparable horseman alone was capable, he threw his horse forward to\r\nwithin ten paces of the white horse; already his hand was stretched out\r\nto seize his prey.\r\n\r\n“Kill me! kill me!” cried Fouquet, “‘twould be more humane!”\r\n\r\n“No! alive--alive!” murmured the captain.\r\n\r\nAt this moment his horse made a false step for the second time, and\r\nFouquet’s again took the lead. It was an unheard-of spectacle, this\r\nrace between two horses which now only kept alive by the will of their\r\nriders. It might be said that D’Artagnan rode, carrying his horse along\r\nbetween his knees. To the furious gallop had succeeded the fast trot,\r\nand that had sunk to what might be scarcely called a trot at all.\r\nBut the chase appeared equally warm in the two fatigued _athletoe_.\r\nD’Artagnan, quite in despair, seized his second pistol, and cocked it.\r\n\r\n“At your horse! not at you!” cried he to Fouquet. And he fired. The\r\nanimal was hit in the quarters--he made a furious bound, and plunged\r\nforward. At that moment D’Artagnan’s horse fell dead.\r\n\r\n“I am dishonored!” thought the musketeer; “I am a miserable wretch! for\r\npity’s sake, M. Fouquet, throw me one of your pistols, that I may blow\r\nout my brains!” But Fouquet rode away.\r\n\r\n“For mercy’s sake! for mercy’s sake!” cried D’Artagnan; “that which you\r\nwill not do at this moment, I myself will do within an hour, but here,\r\nupon this road, I should die bravely; I should die esteemed; do me that\r\nservice, M. Fouquet!”\r\n\r\nM. Fouquet made no reply, but continued to trot on. D’Artagnan began to\r\nrun after his enemy. Successively he threw away his hat, his coat, which\r\nembarrassed him, and then the sheath of his sword, which got between his\r\nlegs as he was running. The sword in his hand itself became too heavy,\r\nand he threw it after the sheath. The white horse began to rattle in\r\nits throat; D’Artagnan gained upon him. From a trot the exhausted animal\r\nsunk to a staggering walk--the foam from his mouth was mixed with blood.\r\nD’Artagnan made a desperate effort, sprang towards Fouquet, and seized\r\nhim by the leg, saying in a broken, breathless voice, “I arrest you in\r\nthe king’s name! blow my brains out, if you like; we have both done our\r\nduty.”\r\n\r\nFouquet hurled far from him, into the river, the two pistols D’Artagnan\r\nmight have seized, and dismounting from his horse--“I am your prisoner,\r\nmonsieur,” said he; “will you take my arm, for I see you are ready to\r\nfaint?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks!” murmured D’Artagnan, who, in fact, felt the earth sliding from\r\nunder his feet, and the light of day turning to blackness around him;\r\nthen he rolled upon the sand, without breath or strength. Fouquet\r\nhastened to the brink of the river, dipped some water in his hat, with\r\nwhich he bathed the temples of the musketeer, and introduced a few drop\r\nbetween his lips. D’Artagnan raised himself with difficulty, and looked\r\nabout him with a wandering eye. He beheld Fouquet on his knees, with his\r\nwet hat in his hand, smiling upon him with ineffable sweetness. “You are\r\nnot off, then?” cried he. “Oh, monsieur! the true king of royalty,\r\nin heart, in soul, is not Louis of the Louvre, or Philippe of\r\nSainte-Marguerite; it is you, proscribed, condemned!”\r\n\r\n“I, who this day am ruined by a single error, M. d’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“What, in the name of Heaven, is that?”\r\n\r\n“I should have had you for a friend! But how shall we return to Nantes?\r\nWe are a great way from it.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” said D’Artagnan, gloomily.\r\n\r\n“The white horse will recover, perhaps; he is a good horse! Mount,\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan; I will walk till you have rested a little.”\r\n\r\n“Poor beast! and wounded, too?” said the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“He will go, I tell you; I know him; but we can do better still, let us\r\nboth get up, and ride slowly.”\r\n\r\n“We can try,” said the captain. But they had scarcely charged the animal\r\nwith this double load, when he began to stagger, and then with a great\r\neffort walked a few minutes, then staggered again, and sank down dead by\r\nthe side of the black horse, which he had just managed to come up to.\r\n\r\n“We will go on foot--destiny wills it so--the walk will be pleasant,”\r\n said Fouquet, passing his arm through that of D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“_Mordioux!_” cried the latter, with a fixed eye, a contracted brow, and\r\na swelling heart--“What a disgraceful day!”\r\n\r\nThey walked slowly the four leagues which separated them from the little\r\nwood behind which the carriage and escort were in waiting. When Fouquet\r\nperceived that sinister machine, he said to D’Artagnan, who cast down\r\nhis eyes, ashamed of Louis XIV., “There is an idea that did not emanate\r\nfrom a brave man, Captain d’Artagnan; it is not yours. What are these\r\ngratings for?” said he.\r\n\r\n“To prevent your throwing letters out.”\r\n\r\n“Ingenious!”\r\n\r\n“But you can speak, if you cannot write,” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Can I speak to you?”\r\n\r\n“Why, certainly, if you wish to do so.”\r\n\r\nFouquet reflected for a moment, then looking the captain full in the\r\nface, “One single word,” said he; “will you remember it?”\r\n\r\n“I will not forget it.”\r\n\r\n“Will you speak it to whom I wish?”\r\n\r\n“I will.”\r\n\r\n“Saint-Mande,” articulated Fouquet, in a low voice.\r\n\r\n“Well! and for whom?”\r\n\r\n“For Madame de Belliere or Pelisson.”\r\n\r\n“It shall be done.”\r\n\r\nThe carriage rolled through Nantes, and took the route to Angers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLI. In Which the Squirrel Falls,--the Adder Flies.\r\n\r\nIt was two o’clock in the afternoon. The king, full of impatience,\r\nwent to his cabinet on the terrace, and kept opening the door of the\r\ncorridor, to see what his secretaries were doing. M. Colbert, seated in\r\nthe same place M. de Saint-Aignan had so long occupied in the morning,\r\nwas chatting in a low voice with M. de Brienne. The king opened the door\r\nsuddenly, and addressed them. “What is it you are saying?”\r\n\r\n“We were speaking of the first sitting of the States,” said M. de\r\nBrienne, rising.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied the king, and returned to his room.\r\n\r\nFive minutes after, the summons of the bell recalled Rose, whose hour it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n“Have you finished your copies?” asked the king.\r\n\r\n“Not yet, sire.”\r\n\r\n“See if M. d’Artagnan has returned.”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, sire.”\r\n\r\n“It is very strange,” murmured the king. “Call M. Colbert.”\r\n\r\nColbert entered; he had been expecting this all the morning.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Colbert,” said the king, very sharply; “you must ascertain\r\nwhat has become of M. d’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\nColbert in his calm voice replied, “Where does your majesty desire him\r\nto be sought for?”\r\n\r\n“Eh! monsieur! do you not know on what I have sent him?” replied Louis,\r\nacrimoniously.\r\n\r\n“Your majesty did not inform me.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, there are things that must be guessed; and you, above all,\r\nare apt to guess them.”\r\n\r\n“I might have been able to imagine, sire; but I do not presume to be\r\npositive.”\r\n\r\nColbert had not finished these words when a rougher voice than that of\r\nthe king interrupted the interesting conversation thus begun between the\r\nmonarch and his clerk.\r\n\r\n“D’Artagnan!” cried the king, with evident joy.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, pale and in evidently bad humor, cried to the king, as\r\nhe entered, “Sire, is it your majesty who has given orders to my\r\nmusketeers?”\r\n\r\n“What orders?” said the king.\r\n\r\n“About M. Fouquet’s house?”\r\n\r\n“None!” replied Louis.\r\n\r\n“Ha!” said D’Artagnan, biting his mustache; “I was not mistaken, then;\r\nit was monsieur here;” and he pointed to Colbert.\r\n\r\n“What orders? Let me know,” said the king.\r\n\r\n“Orders to turn the house topsy-turvy, to beat M. Fouquet’s servants, to\r\nforce the drawers, to give over a peaceful house to pillage! _Mordioux!_\r\nthese are savage orders!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur!” said Colbert, turning pale.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” interrupted D’Artagnan, “the king alone, understand,--the\r\nking alone has a right to command my musketeers; but, as to you, I\r\nforbid you to do it, and I tell you so before his majesty; gentlemen who\r\ncarry swords do not sling pens behind their ears.”\r\n\r\n“D’Artagnan! D’Artagnan!” murmured the king.\r\n\r\n“It is humiliating,” continued the musketeer; “my soldiers are\r\ndisgraced. I do not command _reitres_, thank you, nor clerks of the\r\nintendant, _mordioux!_”\r\n\r\n“Well! but what is all this about?” said the king with authority.\r\n\r\n“About this, sire; monsieur--monsieur, who could not guess your\r\nmajesty’s orders, and consequently could not know I was gone to arrest\r\nM. Fouquet; monsieur, who has caused the iron cage to be constructed for\r\nhis patron of yesterday--has sent M. de Roncherolles to the lodgings\r\nof M. Fouquet, and, under the pretense of securing the surintendant’s\r\npapers, they have taken away the furniture. My musketeers have been\r\nposted round the house all the morning; such were my orders. Why did any\r\none presume to order them to enter? Why, by forcing them to assist in\r\nthis pillage, have they been made accomplices in it? _Mordioux!_ we\r\nserve the king, we do; but we do not serve M. Colbert!” [5]\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the king, sternly, “take care; it is not in\r\nmy presence that such explanations, and made in such a tone, should take\r\nplace.”\r\n\r\n“I have acted for the good of the king,” said Colbert, in a faltering\r\nvoice. “It is hard to be so treated by one of your majesty’s officers,\r\nand that without redress, on account of the respect I owe the king.”\r\n\r\n“The respect you owe the king,” cried D’Artagnan, his eyes flashing\r\nfire, “consists, in the first place, in making his authority respected,\r\nand his person beloved. Every agent of a power without control\r\nrepresents that power, and when people curse the hand which strikes\r\nthem, it is the royal hand that God reproaches, do you hear? Must a\r\nsoldier, hardened by forty years of wounds and blood, give you this\r\nlesson, monsieur? Must mercy be on my side, and ferocity on yours? You\r\nhave caused the innocent to be arrested, bound, and imprisoned!”\r\n\r\n“Accomplices, perhaps, of M. Fouquet,” said Colbert.\r\n\r\n“Who told you M. Fouquet had accomplices, or even that he was guilty?\r\nThe king alone knows that; his justice is not blind! When he says,\r\n‘Arrest and imprison’ such and such a man, he is obeyed. Do not talk to\r\nme, then, any more of the respect you owe the king, and be careful of\r\nyour words, that they may not chance to convey the slightest menace;\r\nfor the king will not allow those to be threatened who do him service\r\nby others who do him disservice; and if in case I should have, which God\r\nforbid! a master so ungrateful, I would make myself respected.”\r\n\r\nThus saying, D’Artagnan took his station haughtily in the king’s\r\ncabinet, his eyes flashing, his hand on his sword, his lips trembling,\r\naffecting much more anger than he really felt. Colbert, humiliated and\r\ndevoured with rage, bowed to the king as if to ask his permission to\r\nleave the room. The king, thwarted alike in pride and in curiosity, knew\r\nnot which part to take. D’Artagnan saw him hesitate. To remain longer\r\nwould have been a mistake: it was necessary to score a triumph over\r\nColbert, and the only method was to touch the king so near the quick,\r\nthat his majesty would have no other means of extrication but choosing\r\nbetween the two antagonists. D’Artagnan bowed as Colbert had done; but\r\nthe king, who, in preference to everything else, was anxious to have all\r\nthe exact details of the arrest of the surintendant of the finances from\r\nhim who had made him tremble for a moment,--the king, perceiving that\r\nthe ill-humor of D’Artagnan would put off for half an hour at least the\r\ndetails he was burning to be acquainted with,--Louis, we say, forgot\r\nColbert, who had nothing new to tell him, and recalled his captain of\r\nthe musketeers.\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” said he, “let me see the result of your\r\ncommission, monsieur; you may rest yourself hereafter.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, who was just passing through the doorway, stopped at the\r\nvoice of the king, retraced his steps, and Colbert was forced to leave\r\nthe closet. His countenance assumed almost a purple hue, his black and\r\nthreatening eyes shone with a dark fire beneath their thick brows; he\r\nstepped out, bowed before the king, half drew himself up in passing\r\nD’Artagnan, and went away with death in his heart. D’Artagnan, on\r\nbeing left alone with the king, softened immediately, and composing his\r\ncountenance: “Sire,” said he, “you are a young king. It is by the dawn\r\nthat people judge whether the day will be fine or dull. How, sire, will\r\nthe people, whom the hand of God has placed under your law, argue\r\nof your reign, if between them and you, you allow angry and violent\r\nministers to interpose their mischief? But let us speak of myself, sire,\r\nlet us leave a discussion that may appear idle, and perhaps inconvenient\r\nto you. Let us speak of myself. I have arrested M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\n“You took plenty of time about it,” said the king, sharply.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan looked at the king. “I perceive that I have expressed\r\nmyself badly. I announced to your majesty that I had arrested Monsieur\r\nFouquet.”\r\n\r\n“You did; and what then?”\r\n\r\n“Well! I ought to have told your majesty that M. Fouquet had arrested\r\nme; that would have been more just. I re-establish the truth, then; I\r\nhave been arrested by M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\nIt was now the turn of Louis XIV. to be surprised. His majesty was\r\nastonished in his turn.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, with his quick glance, appreciated what was passing in the\r\nheart of his master. He did not allow him time to put any questions. He\r\nrelated, with that poetry, that picturesqueness, which perhaps he\r\nalone possessed at that period, the escape of Fouquet, the pursuit,\r\nthe furious race, and, lastly, the inimitable generosity of the\r\nsurintendant, who might have fled ten times over, who might have killed\r\nthe adversary in the pursuit, but who had preferred imprisonment,\r\nperhaps worse, to the humiliation of one who wished to rob him of his\r\nliberty. In proportion as the tale advanced, the king became agitated,\r\ndevouring the narrator’s words, and drumming with his finger-nails upon\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n“It results from all this, sire, in my eyes, at least, that the man who\r\nconducts himself thus is a gallant man, and cannot be an enemy to the\r\nking. That is my opinion, and I repeat it to your majesty. I know what\r\nthe king will say to me, and I bow to it,--reasons of state. So be it!\r\nTo my ears that sounds highly respectable. But I am a soldier, and I\r\nhave received my orders, my orders are executed--very unwillingly on my\r\npart, it is true, but they are executed. I say no more.”\r\n\r\n“Where is M. Fouquet at this moment?” asked Louis, after a short\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“M. Fouquet, sire,” replied D’Artagnan, “is in the iron cage that M.\r\nColbert had prepared for him, and is galloping as fast as four strong\r\nhorses can drag him, towards Angers.”\r\n\r\n“Why did you leave him on the road?”\r\n\r\n“Because your majesty did not tell me to go to Angers. The proof, the\r\nbest proof of what I advance, is that the king desired me to be sought\r\nfor but this minute. And then I had another reason.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“Whilst I was with him, poor M. Fouquet would never attempt to escape.”\r\n\r\n“Well!” cried the king, astonished.\r\n\r\n“Your majesty ought to understand, and does understand, certainly, that\r\nmy warmest wish is to know that M. Fouquet is at liberty. I have\r\ngiven him one of my brigadiers, the most stupid I could find among my\r\nmusketeers, in order that the prisoner might have a chance of escaping.”\r\n\r\n“Are you mad, Monsieur d’Artagnan?” cried the king, crossing his arms\r\non his breast. “Do people utter such enormities, even when they have the\r\nmisfortune to think them?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! sire, you cannot expect that I should be an enemy to M. Fouquet,\r\nafter what he has just done for you and me. No, no; if you desire that\r\nhe should remain under your lock and bolt, never give him in charge to\r\nme; however closely wired might be the cage, the bird would, in the end,\r\ntake wing.”\r\n\r\n“I am surprised,” said the king, in his sternest tone, “you did not\r\nfollow the fortunes of the man M. Fouquet wished to place upon my\r\nthrone. You had in him all you want--affection, gratitude. In my\r\nservice, monsieur, you will only find a master.”\r\n\r\n“If M. Fouquet had not gone to seek you in the Bastile, sire,” replied\r\nD’Artagnan, with a deeply impressive manner, “one single man would have\r\ngone there, and I should have been that man--you know that right well,\r\nsire.”\r\n\r\nThe king was brought to a pause. Before that speech of his captain of\r\nthe musketeers, so frankly spoken and so true, the king had nothing to\r\noffer. On hearing D’Artagnan, Louis remembered the D’Artagnan of former\r\ntimes; him who, at the Palais Royal, held himself concealed behind the\r\ncurtains of his bed, when the people of Paris, led by Cardinal de Retz,\r\ncame to assure themselves of the presence of the king; the D’Artagnan\r\nwhom he saluted with his hand at the door of his carriage, when\r\nrepairing to Notre Dame on his return to Paris; the soldier who had\r\nquitted his service at Blois; the lieutenant he had recalled to be\r\nbeside his person when the death of Mazarin restored his power; the man\r\nhe had always found loyal, courageous, devoted. Louis advanced towards\r\nthe door and called Colbert. Colbert had not left the corridor where the\r\nsecretaries were at work. He reappeared.\r\n\r\n“Colbert, did you make a perquisition on the house of M. Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“What has it produced?”\r\n\r\n“M. de Roncherolles, who was sent with your majesty’s musketeers, has\r\nremitted me some papers,” replied Colbert.\r\n\r\n“I will look at them. Give me your hand.”\r\n\r\n“My hand, sire!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that I may place it in that of M. d’Artagnan. In fact, M.\r\nd’Artagnan,” added he, with a smile, turning towards the soldier, who,\r\nat sight of the clerk, had resumed his haughty attitude, “you do not\r\nknow this man; make his acquaintance.” And he pointed to Colbert. “He\r\nhas been made but a moderately valuable servant in subaltern positions,\r\nbut he will be a great man if I raise him to the foremost rank.”\r\n\r\n“Sire!” stammered Colbert, confused with pleasure and fear.\r\n\r\n“I always understood why,” murmured D’Artagnan in the king’s ear; “he\r\nwas jealous.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely, and his jealousy confined his wings.”\r\n\r\n“He will henceforward be a winged-serpent,” grumbled the musketeer, with\r\na remnant of hatred against his recent adversary.\r\n\r\nBut Colbert, approaching him, offered to his eyes a physiognomy so\r\ndifferent from that which he had been accustomed to see him wear; he\r\nappeared so good, so mild, so easy; his eyes took the expression of an\r\nintelligence so noble, that D’Artagnan, a connoisseur in physiognomies,\r\nwas moved, and almost changed in his convictions. Colbert pressed his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“That which the king has just told you, monsieur, proves how well\r\nhis majesty is acquainted with men. The inveterate opposition I have\r\ndisplayed, up to this day, against abuses and not against men, proves\r\nthat I had it in view to prepare for my king a glorious reign, for my\r\ncountry a great blessing. I have many ideas, M. d’Artagnan. You will\r\nsee them expand in the sun of public peace; and if I have not the good\r\nfortune to conquer the friendship of honest men, I am at least certain,\r\nmonsieur, that I shall obtain their esteem. For their admiration,\r\nmonsieur, I would give my life.”\r\n\r\nThis change, this sudden elevation, this mute approbation of the king,\r\ngave the musketeer matter for profound reflection. He bowed civilly to\r\nColbert, who did not take his eyes off him. The king, when he saw they\r\nwere reconciled, dismissed them. They left the room together. As soon\r\nas they were out of the cabinet, the new minister, stopping the captain,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“Is it possible, M. d’Artagnan, that with such an eye as yours, you did\r\nnot, at the first glance, at the first impression, discover what sort of\r\nman I am?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Colbert,” replied the musketeer, “a ray of the sun in our eyes\r\nprevents us from seeing the most vivid flame. The man in power radiates,\r\nyou know; and since you are there, why should you continue to persecute\r\nhim who had just fallen into disgrace, and fallen from such a height?”\r\n\r\n“I, monsieur!” said Colbert; “oh, monsieur! I would never persecute\r\nhim. I wished to administer the finances and to administer them alone,\r\nbecause I am ambitious, and, above all, because I have the most entire\r\nconfidence in my own merit; because I know that all the gold of this\r\ncountry will ebb and flow beneath my eyes, and I love to look at the\r\nking’s gold; because, if I live thirty years, in thirty years not a\r\n_denir_ of it will remain in my hands; because, with that gold, I will\r\nbuild granaries, castles, cities, and harbors; because I will create a\r\nmarine, I will equip navies that shall waft the name of France to the\r\nmost distant people; because I will create libraries and academies;\r\nbecause I will make France the first country in the world, and the\r\nwealthiest. These are the motives for my animosity against M. Fouquet,\r\nwho prevented my acting. And then, when I shall be great and strong,\r\nwhen France is great and strong, in my turn, then, will I cry, ‘Mercy’!”\r\n\r\n“Mercy, did you say? then ask his liberty of the king. The king is only\r\ncrushing him on _your_ account.”\r\n\r\nColbert again raised his head. “Monsieur,” said he, “you know that is\r\nnot so, and that the king has his own personal animosity against M.\r\nFouquet; it is not for me to teach you that.”\r\n\r\n“But the king will grow tired; he will forget.”\r\n\r\n“The king never forgets, M. d’Artagnan. Hark! the king calls. He is\r\ngoing to issue an order. I have not influenced him, have I? Listen.”\r\n\r\nThe king, in fact, was calling his secretaries. “Monsieur d’Artagnan,”\r\n said he.\r\n\r\n“I am here, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Give twenty of your musketeers to M. de Saint-Aignan, to form a guard\r\nfor M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan and Colbert exchanged looks. “And from Angers,” continued the\r\nking, “they will conduct the prisoner to the Bastile, in Paris.”\r\n\r\n“You were right,” said the captain to the minister.\r\n\r\n“Saint-Aignan,” continued the king, “you will have any one shot who\r\nshall attempt to speak privately with M. Fouquet, during the journey.”\r\n\r\n“But myself, sire,” said the duke.\r\n\r\n“You, monsieur, you will only speak to him in the presence of the\r\nmusketeers.” The duke bowed and departed to execute his commission.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan was about to retire likewise; but the king stopped him.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he, “you will go immediately, and take possession of\r\nthe isle and fief of Belle-Ile-en-Mer.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire. Alone?”\r\n\r\n“You will take a sufficient number of troops to prevent delay, in case\r\nthe place should be contumacious.”\r\n\r\nA murmur of courtly incredulity rose from the group of courtiers. “That\r\nshall be done,” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“I saw the place in my infancy,” resumed the king, “and I do not wish to\r\nsee it again. You have heard me? Go, monsieur, and do not return without\r\nthe keys.”\r\n\r\nColbert went up to D’Artagnan. “A commission which, if you carry it out\r\nwell,” said he, “will be worth a marechal’s baton to you.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you employ the words, ‘if you carry it out well’?”\r\n\r\n“Because it is difficult.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! in what respect?”\r\n\r\n“You have friends in Belle-Isle, Monsieur d’Artagnan; and it is not an\r\neasy thing for men like you to march over the bodies of their friends to\r\nobtain success.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan hung his head in deepest thought, whilst Colbert returned to\r\nthe king. A quarter of an hour after, the captain received the written\r\norder from the king, to blow up the fortress of Belle-Isle, in case of\r\nresistance, with power of life and death over all the inhabitants or\r\nrefugees, and an injunction not to allow one to escape.\r\n\r\n“Colbert was right,” thought D’Artagnan; “for me the baton of a marechal\r\nof France will cost the lives of my two friends. Only they seem to\r\nforget that my friends are not more stupid than the birds, and that they\r\nwill not wait for the hand of the fowler to extend over their wings.\r\nI will show them that hand so plainly, that they will have quite time\r\nenough to see it. Poor Porthos! Poor Aramis! No; my fortune should shall\r\nnot cost your wings a feather.”\r\n\r\nHaving thus determined, D’Artagnan assembled the royal army, embarked it\r\nat Paimboeuf, and set sail, without the loss of an unnecessary minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLII. Belle-Ile-en-Mer.\r\n\r\nAt the extremity of the mole, against which the furious sea beats at the\r\nevening tide, two men, holding each other by the arm, were conversing\r\nin an animated and expansive tone, without the possibility of any other\r\nhuman being hearing their words, borne away, as they were, one by one,\r\nby the gusts of wind, with the white foam swept from the crests of the\r\nwaves. The sun had just gone down in the vast sheet of the crimsoned\r\nocean, like a gigantic crucible. From time to time, one of these men,\r\nturning towards the east, cast an anxious, inquiring look over the sea.\r\nThe other, interrogating the features of his companion, seemed to seek\r\nfor information in his looks. Then, both silent, busied with dismal\r\nthoughts, they resumed their walk. Every one has already perceived that\r\nthese two men were our proscribed heroes, Porthos and Aramis, who had\r\ntaken refuge in Belle-Isle, since the ruin of their hopes, since the\r\ndiscomfiture of the colossal schemes of M. d’Herblay.\r\n\r\n“If is of no use your saying anything to the contrary, my dear Aramis,”\r\n repeated Porthos, inhaling vigorously the salt breeze with which he\r\ncharged his massive chest, “It is of no use, Aramis. The disappearance\r\nof all the fishing-boats that went out two days ago is not an ordinary\r\ncircumstance. There has been no storm at sea; the weather has been\r\nconstantly calm, not even the lightest gale; and even if we had had\r\na tempest, all our boats would not have foundered. I repeat, it is\r\nstrange. This complete disappearance astonishes me, I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“True,” murmured Aramis. “You are right, friend Porthos; it is true,\r\nthere is something strange in it.”\r\n\r\n“And further,” added Porthos, whose ideas the assent of the bishop of\r\nVannes seemed to enlarge; “and, further, do you not observe that if the\r\nboats have perished, not a single plank has washed ashore?”\r\n\r\n“I have remarked it as well as yourself.”\r\n\r\n“And do you not think it strange that the two only boats we had left in\r\nthe whole island, and which I sent in search of the others--”\r\n\r\nAramis here interrupted his companion by a cry, and by so sudden a\r\nmovement, that Porthos stopped as if he were stupefied. “What do you\r\nsay, Porthos? What!--You have sent the two boats--”\r\n\r\n“In search of the others! Yes, to be sure I have,” replied Porthos,\r\ncalmly.\r\n\r\n“Unhappy man! What have you done? Then we are indeed lost,” cried the\r\nbishop.\r\n\r\n“Lost!--what did you say?” exclaimed the terrified Porthos. “How lost,\r\nAramis? How are we lost?”\r\n\r\nAramis bit his lips. “Nothing! nothing! Your pardon, I meant to say--”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“That if we were inclined--if we took a fancy to make an excursion by\r\nsea, we could not.”\r\n\r\n“Very good! and why should that vex you? A precious pleasure, _ma foi!_\r\nFor my part, I don’t regret it at all. What I regret is certainly not\r\nthe more or less amusement we can find at Belle-Isle: what I regret,\r\nAramis, is Pierrefonds; Bracieux; le Vallon; beautiful France! Here, we\r\nare not in France, my dear friend; we are--I know not where. Oh! I\r\ntell you, in full sincerity of soul, and your affection will excuse my\r\nfrankness, but I declare to you I am not happy at Belle-Isle. No; in\r\ngood truth, I am not happy!”\r\n\r\nAramis breathed a long, but stifled sigh. “Dear friend,” replied he:\r\n“that is why it is so sad a thing you have sent the two boats we had\r\nleft in search of the boats which disappeared two days ago. If you had\r\nnot sent them away, we would have departed.”\r\n\r\n“‘Departed!’ And the orders, Aramis?”\r\n\r\n“What orders?”\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu!_ Why, the orders you have been constantly, in and out of\r\nseason, repeating to me--that we were to hold Belle-Isle against the\r\nusurper. You know very well!”\r\n\r\n“That is true!” murmured Aramis again.\r\n\r\n“You see, then, plainly, my friend, that we could not depart; and that\r\nthe sending away of the boats in search of the others cannot prove\r\nprejudicial to us in the very least.”\r\n\r\nAramis was silent; and his vague glances, luminous as that of an\r\nalbatross, hovered for a long time over the sea, interrogating space,\r\nseeking to pierce the very horizon.\r\n\r\n“With all that, Aramis,” continued Porthos, who adhered to his idea,\r\nand that the more closely from the bishop having apparently endorsed\r\nit,--“with all that, you give me no explanation about what can have\r\nhappened to these unfortunate boats. I am assailed by cries and\r\ncomplaints whichever way I go. The children cry to see the desolation of\r\nthe women, as if I could restore the absent husbands and fathers. What\r\ndo you suppose, my friend, and how ought I to answer them?”\r\n\r\n“Think all you like, my good Porthos, and say nothing.”\r\n\r\nThis reply did not satisfy Porthos at all. He turned away grumbling\r\nsomething in ill-humor. Aramis stopped the valiant musketeer. “Do you\r\nremember,” said he, in a melancholy tone, kneading the two hands of the\r\ngiant between his own with affectionate cordiality, “do you remember,\r\nmy friend, that in the glorious days of youth--do you remember, Porthos,\r\nwhen we were all strong and valiant--we, and the other two--if we had\r\nthen had an inclination to return to France, do you think this sheet of\r\nsalt water would have stopped us?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Porthos; “but six leagues.”\r\n\r\n“If you had seen me get astride of a plank, would you have remained on\r\nland, Porthos?”\r\n\r\n“No, _pardieu!_ No, Aramis. But, nowadays, what sort of a plank should\r\nwe want, my friend! I, in particular.” And the Seigneur de Bracieux cast\r\na profound glance over his colossal rotundity with a loud laugh. “And do\r\nyou mean seriously to say you are not tired of Belle-Isle a little,\r\nand that you would not prefer the comforts of your dwelling--of your\r\nepiscopal palace, at Vannes? Come, confess.”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Aramis, without daring to look at Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Let us stay where we are, then,” said his friend, with a sigh, which,\r\nin spite of the efforts he made to restrain it, escaped his echoing\r\nbreast. “Let us remain!--let us remain! And yet,” added he, “and yet,\r\nif we seriously wished, but that decidedly--if we had a fixed idea, one\r\nfirmly taken, to return to France, and there were not boats--”\r\n\r\n“Have you remarked another thing, my friend--that is, since the\r\ndisappearance of our barks, during the last two days’ absence of\r\nfishermen, not a single small boat has landed on the shores of the\r\nisle?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, certainly! you are right. I, too, have remarked it, and the\r\nobservation was the more naturally made, for, before the last two fatal\r\ndays, barks and shallops were as plentiful as shrimps.”\r\n\r\n“I must inquire,” said Aramis, suddenly, and with great agitation. “And\r\nthen, if we had a raft constructed--”\r\n\r\n“But there are some canoes, my friend; shall I board one?”\r\n\r\n“A canoe!--a canoe! Can you think of such a thing, Porthos? A canoe to\r\nbe upset in. No, no,” said the bishop of Vannes; “it is not our trade to\r\nride upon the waves. We will wait, we will wait.”\r\n\r\nAnd Aramis continued walking about with increased agitation. Porthos,\r\nwho grew tired of following all the feverish movements of his\r\nfriend--Porthos, who in his faith and calmness understood nothing of\r\nthe sort of exasperation which was betrayed by his companion’s continual\r\nconvulsive starts--Porthos stopped him. “Let us sit down upon this\r\nrock,” said he. “Place yourself there, close to me, Aramis, and I\r\nconjure you, for the last time, to explain to me in a manner I can\r\ncomprehend--explain to me what we are doing here.”\r\n\r\n“Porthos,” said Aramis, much embarrassed.\r\n\r\n“I know that the false king wished to dethrone the true king. That is a\r\nfact, that I understand. Well--”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“I know that the false king formed the project of selling Belle-Isle to\r\nthe English. I understand that, too.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?”\r\n\r\n“I know that we engineers and captains came and threw ourselves into\r\nBelle-Isle to take direction of the works, and the command of ten\r\ncompanies levied and paid by M. Fouquet, or rather the ten companies of\r\nhis son-in-law. All that is plain.”\r\n\r\nAramis rose in a state of great impatience. He might be said to be a\r\nlion importuned by a gnat. Porthos held him by the arm. “But what I\r\ncannot understand, what, in spite of all the efforts of my mind, and\r\nall my reflections, I cannot comprehend, and never shall comprehend, is,\r\nthat instead of sending us troops, instead of sending us reinforcements\r\nof men, munitions, provisions, they leave us without boats, they\r\nleave Belle-Isle without arrivals, without help; it is that instead of\r\nestablishing with us a correspondence, whether by signals, or written\r\nor verbal communications, all relations with the shore are intercepted.\r\nTell me, Aramis, answer me, or rather, before answering me, will you\r\nallow me to tell you what I have thought? Will you hear what my idea is,\r\nthe plan I have conceived?”\r\n\r\nThe bishop raised his head. “Well! Aramis,” continued Porthos, “I have\r\ndreamed, I have imagined that an event has taken place in France. I\r\ndreamt of M. Fouquet all the night, of lifeless fish, of broken eggs,\r\nof chambers badly furnished, meanly kept. Villainous dreams, my dear\r\nD’Herblay; very unlucky, such dreams!”\r\n\r\n“Porthos, what is that yonder?” interrupted Aramis, rising suddenly, and\r\npointing out to his friend a black spot upon the empurpled line of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n“A bark!” said Porthos; “yes, it is a bark! Ah! we shall have some news\r\nat last.”\r\n\r\n“There are two!” cried the bishop, on discovering another mast; “two!\r\nthree! four!”\r\n\r\n“Five!” said Porthos, in his turn. “Six! seven! Ah! _mon Dieu! mon\r\nDieu!_ it is a fleet!”\r\n\r\n“Our boats returning, probably,” said Aramis, very uneasily, in spite of\r\nthe assurance he affected.\r\n\r\n“They are very large for fishing-boats,” observed Porthos, “and do you\r\nnot remark, my friend, that they come from the Loire?”\r\n\r\n“They come from the Loire--yes--”\r\n\r\n“And look! everybody here sees them as well as ourselves; look, women\r\nand children are beginning to crowd the jetty.”\r\n\r\nAn old fisherman passed. “Are those our barks, yonder?” asked Aramis.\r\n\r\nThe old man looked steadily into the eye of the horizon.\r\n\r\n“No, monseigneur,” replied he, “they are lighter boars, boats in the\r\nking’s service.”\r\n\r\n“Boats in the royal service?” replied Aramis, starting. “How do you know\r\nthat?” said he.\r\n\r\n“By the flag.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Porthos, “the boat is scarcely visible; how the devil, my\r\nfriend, can you distinguish the flag?”\r\n\r\n“I see there is one,” replied the old man; “our boats, trade lighters,\r\ndo not carry any. That sort of craft is generally used for transport of\r\ntroops.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” groaned Aramis.\r\n\r\n“_Vivat!_” cried Porthos, “they are sending us reinforcements, don’t you\r\nthink they are, Aramis?”\r\n\r\n“Probably.”\r\n\r\n“Unless it is the English coming.”\r\n\r\n“By the Loire? That would have an evil look, Porthos; for they must have\r\ncome through Paris!”\r\n\r\n“You are right; they are reinforcements, decidedly, or provisions.”\r\n\r\nAramis leaned his head upon his hands, and made no reply. Then, all at\r\nonce,--“Porthos,” said he, “have the alarm sounded.”\r\n\r\n“The alarm! do you imagine such a thing?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and let the cannoniers mount their batteries, the artillerymen be\r\nat their pieces, and be particularly watchful of the coast batteries.”\r\n\r\nPorthos opened his eyes to their widest extent. He looked attentively at\r\nhis friend, to convince himself he was in his proper senses.\r\n\r\n“_I_ will do it, my dear Porthos,” continued Aramis, in his blandest\r\ntone; “I will go and have these orders executed myself, if you do not\r\ngo, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Well! I will--instantly!” said Porthos, who went to execute the orders,\r\ncasting all the while looks behind him, to see if the bishop of Vannes\r\nwere not deceived; and if, on recovering more rational ideas, he would\r\nnot recall him. The alarm was sounded, trumpets brayed, drums rolled;\r\nthe great bronze bell swung in horror from its lofty belfry. The dikes\r\nand moles were quickly filled with the curious and soldiers; matches\r\nsparkled in the hands of the artillerymen, placed behind the large\r\ncannon bedded in their stone carriages. When every man was at his post,\r\nwhen all the preparations for defense were made: “Permit me, Aramis, to\r\ntry to comprehend,” whispered Porthos, timidly, in Aramis’s ear.\r\n\r\n“My dear friend, you will comprehend but too soon,” murmured M.\r\nd’Herblay, in reply to this question of his lieutenant.\r\n\r\n“The fleet which is coming yonder, with sails unfurled, straight towards\r\nthe port of Belle-Isle, is a royal fleet, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“But as there are two kings in France, Porthos, to which of these two\r\nkings does this fleet belong?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you open my eyes,” replied the giant, stunned by the insinuation.\r\n\r\nAnd Porthos, whose eyes this reply of his friend’s had at last opened,\r\nor rather thickened the bandage which covered his sight, went with his\r\nbest speed to the batteries to overlook his people, and exhort every\r\none to do his duty. In the meantime, Aramis, with his eye fixed on the\r\nhorizon, saw the ships continually drawing nearer. The people and the\r\nsoldiers, perched on the summits of the rocks, could distinguish the\r\nmasts, then the lower sails, and at last the hulls of the lighters,\r\nbearing at the masthead the royal flag of France. It was night when\r\none of these vessels, which had created such a sensation among the\r\ninhabitants of Belle-Isle, dropped anchor within cannon shot of the\r\nplace. It was soon seen, notwithstanding the darkness, that some sort\r\nof agitation reigned on board the vessel, from the side of which a skiff\r\nwas lowered, of which the three rowers, bending to their oars, took the\r\ndirection of the port, and in a few instants struck land at the foot\r\nof the fort. The commander jumped ashore. He had a letter in his hand,\r\nwhich he waved in the air, and seemed to wish to communicate with\r\nsomebody. This man was soon recognized by several soldiers as one of\r\nthe pilots of the island. He was the captain of one of the two barks\r\nretained by Aramis, but which Porthos, in his anxiety with regard to\r\nthe fate of the fishermen who had disappeared, had sent in search of the\r\nmissing boats. He asked to be conducted to M. d’Herblay. Two soldiers,\r\nat a signal from a sergeant, marched him between them, and escorted him.\r\nAramis was upon the quay. The envoy presented himself before the\r\nbishop of Vannes. The darkness was almost absolute, notwithstanding the\r\nflambeaux borne at a small distance by the soldiers who were following\r\nAramis in his rounds.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jonathan, from whom do you come?”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, from those who captured me.”\r\n\r\n“Who captured you?”\r\n\r\n“You know, monseigneur, we set out in search of our comrades?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; and afterwards?”\r\n\r\n“Well! monseigneur, within a short league we were captured by a _chasse\r\nmaree_ belonging to the king.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Of which king?” cried Porthos.\r\n\r\nJonathan started.\r\n\r\n“Speak!” continued the bishop.\r\n\r\n“We were captured, monseigneur, and joined to those who had been taken\r\nyesterday morning.”\r\n\r\n“What was the cause of the mania for capturing you all?” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, to prevent us from telling you,” replied Jonathan.\r\n\r\nPorthos was again at a loss to comprehend. “And they have released you\r\nto-day?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“That I might tell you they have captured us, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Trouble upon trouble,” thought honest Porthos.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Aramis was reflecting.\r\n\r\n“Humph!” said he, “then I suppose it is a royal fleet blockading the\r\ncoasts?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Who commands it?”\r\n\r\n“The captain of the king’s musketeers.”\r\n\r\n“D’Artagnan?”\r\n\r\n“D’Artagnan!” exclaimed Porthos.\r\n\r\n“I believe that is the name.”\r\n\r\n“And did he give you this letter?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Bring the torches nearer.”\r\n\r\n“It is his writing,” said Porthos.\r\n\r\nAramis eagerly read the following lines:\r\n\r\n“Order of the king to take Belle-Isle; or to put the garrison to the\r\nsword, if they resist; order to make prisoners of all the men of the\r\ngarrison; signed, D’ARTAGNAN, who, the day before yesterday, arrested M.\r\nFouquet, for the purpose of his being sent to the Bastile.”\r\n\r\nAramis turned pale, and crushed the paper in his hands.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Nothing, my friend, nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Jonathan?”\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur?”\r\n\r\n“Did you speak to M. d’Artagnan?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say to you?”\r\n\r\n“That for ampler information, he would speak with monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“On board his own vessel.”\r\n\r\n“On board his vessel!” and Porthos repeated, “On board his vessel!”\r\n\r\n“M. le mousquetaire,” continued Jonathan, “told me to take you both on\r\nboard my canoe, and bring you to him.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go at once,” exclaimed Porthos. “Dear D’Artagnan!”\r\n\r\nBut Aramis stopped him. “Are you mad?” cried he. “Who knows that it is\r\nnot a snare?”\r\n\r\n“Of the other king’s?” said Porthos, mysteriously.\r\n\r\n“A snare, in fact! That’s what it is, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Very possibly; what is to be done, then? If D’Artagnan sends for us--”\r\n\r\n“Who assures you that D’Artagnan sends for us?”\r\n\r\n“Well, but--but his writing--”\r\n\r\n“Writing is easily counterfeited. This looks counterfeited--unsteady--”\r\n\r\n“You are always right; but, in the meantime, we know nothing.”\r\n\r\nAramis was silent.\r\n\r\n“It is true,” said the good Porthos, “we do not want to know anything.”\r\n\r\n“What shall I do?” asked Jonathan.\r\n\r\n“You will return on board this captain’s vessel.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“And will tell him that we beg he will himself come into the island.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I comprehend!” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur,” replied Jonathan; “but if the captain should refuse\r\nto come to Belle-Isle?”\r\n\r\n“If he refuses, as we have cannon, we will make use of them.”\r\n\r\n“What! against D’Artagnan?”\r\n\r\n“If it is D’Artagnan, Porthos, he will come. Go, Jonathan, go!”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ I no longer comprehend anything,” murmured Porthos.\r\n\r\n“I will make you comprehend it all, my dear friend; the time for it has\r\ncome; sit down upon this gun-carriage, open your ears, and listen well\r\nto me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! _pardieu!_ I will listen, no fear of that.”\r\n\r\n“May I depart, monseigneur?” cried Jonathan.\r\n\r\n“Yes, begone, and bring back an answer. Allow the canoe to pass, you men\r\nthere!” And the canoe pushed off to regain the fleet.\r\n\r\nAramis took Porthos by the hand, and commenced his explanations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIII. Explanations by Aramis.\r\n\r\n“What I have to say to you, friend Porthos, will probably surprise you,\r\nbut it may prove instructive.”\r\n\r\n“I like to be surprised,” said Porthos, in a kindly tone; “do not spare\r\nme, therefore, I beg. I am hardened against emotions; don’t fear, speak\r\nout.”\r\n\r\n“It is difficult, Porthos--difficult; for, in truth, I warn you a second\r\ntime, I have very strange things, very extraordinary things, to tell\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you speak so well, my friend, that I could listen to you for days\r\ntogether. Speak, then, I beg--and--stop, I have an idea: I will, to make\r\nyour task more easy, I will, to assist you in telling me such things,\r\nquestion you.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be pleased at your doing so.”\r\n\r\n“What are we going to fight for, Aramis?”\r\n\r\n“If you ask me many such questions as that--if you would render my task\r\nthe easier by interrupting my revelations thus, Porthos, you will not\r\nhelp me at all. So far, on the contrary, that is the very Gordian knot.\r\nBut, my friend, with a man like you, good, generous, and devoted, the\r\nconfession must be bravely made. I have deceived you, my worthy friend.”\r\n\r\n“You have deceived me!”\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens! yes.”\r\n\r\n“Was it for my good, Aramis?”\r\n\r\n“I thought so, Porthos; I thought so sincerely, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said the honest seigneur of Bracieux, “you have rendered me a\r\nservice, and I thank you for it; for if you had not deceived me, I might\r\nhave deceived myself. In what, then, have you deceived me, tell me?”\r\n\r\n“In that I was serving the usurper against whom Louis XIV., at this\r\nmoment, is directing his efforts.”\r\n\r\n“The usurper!” said Porthos, scratching his head. “That is--well, I do\r\nnot quite clearly comprehend!”\r\n\r\n“He is one of the two kings who are contending for the crown of France.”\r\n\r\n“Very well! Then you were serving him who is not Louis XIV.?”\r\n\r\n“You have hit the matter in one word.”\r\n\r\n“It follows that--”\r\n\r\n“It follows that we are rebels, my poor friend.”\r\n\r\n“The devil! the devil!” cried Porthos, much disappointed.\r\n\r\n“Oh! but, dear Porthos, be calm, we shall still find means of getting\r\nout of the affair, trust me.”\r\n\r\n“It is not that which makes me uneasy,” replied Porthos; “that which\r\nalone touches me is that ugly word _rebels_.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! but--”\r\n\r\n“And so, according to this, the duchy that was promised me--”\r\n\r\n“It was the usurper that was to give it to you.”\r\n\r\n“And that is not the same thing, Aramis,” said Porthos, majestically.\r\n\r\n“My friend, if it had only depended upon me, you should have become a\r\nprince.”\r\n\r\nPorthos began to bite his nails in a melancholy way.\r\n\r\n“That is where you have been wrong,” continued he, “in deceiving me; for\r\nthat promised duchy I reckoned upon. Oh! I reckoned upon it seriously,\r\nknowing you to be a man of your word, Aramis.”\r\n\r\n“Poor Porthos! pardon me, I implore you!”\r\n\r\n“So, then,” continued Porthos, without replying to the bishop’s prayer,\r\n“so then, it seems, I have quite fallen out with Louis XIV.?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I will settle all that, my good friend, I will settle all that. I\r\nwill take it on myself alone!”\r\n\r\n“Aramis!”\r\n\r\n“No, no, Porthos, I conjure you, let me act. No false generosity! No\r\ninopportune devotedness! You knew nothing of my projects. You have done\r\nnothing of yourself. With me it is different. I alone am the author of\r\nthis plot. I stood in need of my inseparable companion; I called upon\r\nyou, and you came to me in remembrance of our ancient device, ‘All for\r\none, one for all.’ My crime is that I was an egotist.”\r\n\r\n“Now, that is a word I like,” said Porthos; “and seeing that you have\r\nacted entirely for yourself, it is impossible for me to blame you. It is\r\nnatural.”\r\n\r\nAnd upon this sublime reflection, Porthos pressed his friend’s hand\r\ncordially.\r\n\r\nIn presence of this ingenuous greatness of soul, Aramis felt his own\r\nlittleness. It was the second time he had been compelled to bend before\r\nreal superiority of heart, which is more imposing than brilliancy of\r\nmind. He replied by a mute and energetic pressure to the endearment of\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Porthos, “that we have come to an explanation, now that I am\r\nperfectly aware of our situation with respect to Louis XIV., I think, my\r\nfriend, it is time to make me comprehend the political intrigue of which\r\nwe are the victims--for I plainly see there is a political intrigue at\r\nthe bottom of all this.”\r\n\r\n“D’Artagnan, my good Porthos, D’Artagnan is coming, and will detail it\r\nto you in all its circumstances; but, excuse me, I am deeply grieved, I\r\nam bowed down with mental anguish, and I have need of all my presence\r\nof mind, all my powers of reflection, to extricate you from the false\r\nposition in which I have so imprudently involved you; but nothing can be\r\nmore clear, nothing more plain, than your position, henceforth. The king\r\nLouis XIV. has no longer now but one enemy: that enemy is myself,\r\nmyself alone. I have made you a prisoner, you have followed me, to-day\r\nI liberate you, you fly back to your prince. You can perceive, Porthos,\r\nthere is not one difficulty in all this.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think so?” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“I am quite sure of it.”\r\n\r\n“Then why,” said the admirable good sense of Porthos, “then why, if\r\nwe are in such an easy position, why, my friend, do we prepare cannon,\r\nmuskets, and engines of all sorts? It seems to me it would be much\r\nmore simple to say to Captain d’Artagnan: ‘My dear friend, we have been\r\nmistaken; that error is to be repaired; open the door to us, let us pass\r\nthrough, and we will say good-bye.’”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that!” said Aramis, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Why do you say ‘that’? Do you not approve of my plan, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“I see a difficulty in it.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“The hypothesis that D’Artagnan may come with orders which will oblige\r\nus to defend ourselves.”\r\n\r\n“What! defend ourselves against D’Artagnan? Folly! Against the good\r\nD’Artagnan!”\r\n\r\nAramis once more replied by shaking his head.\r\n\r\n“Porthos,” at length said he, “if I have had the matches lighted and\r\nthe guns pointed, if I have had the signal of alarm sounded, if I have\r\ncalled every man to his post upon the ramparts, those good ramparts of\r\nBelle-Isle which you have so well fortified, it was not for nothing.\r\nWait to judge; or rather, no, do not wait--”\r\n\r\n“What can I do?”\r\n\r\n“If I knew, my friend, I would have told you.”\r\n\r\n“But there is one thing much more simple than defending ourselves:--a\r\nboat, and away for France--where--”\r\n\r\n“My dear friend,” said Aramis, smiling with a strong shade of sadness,\r\n“do not let us reason like children; let us be men in council and in\r\nexecution.--But, hark! I hear a hail for landing at the port. Attention,\r\nPorthos, serious attention!”\r\n\r\n“It is D’Artagnan, no doubt,” said Porthos, in a voice of thunder,\r\napproaching the parapet.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is I,” replied the captain of the musketeers, running lightly\r\nup the steps of the mole, and gaining rapidly the little esplanade on\r\nwhich his two friends waited for him. As soon as he came towards them,\r\nPorthos and Aramis observed an officer who followed D’Artagnan, treading\r\napparently in his very steps. The captain stopped upon the stairs of the\r\nmole, when half-way up. His companions imitated him.\r\n\r\n“Make your men draw back,” cried D’Artagnan to Porthos and Aramis; “let\r\nthem retire out of hearing.” This order, given by Porthos, was executed\r\nimmediately. Then D’Artagnan, turning towards him who followed him:\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he, “we are no longer on board the king’s fleet, where,\r\nin virtue of your order, you spoke so arrogantly to me, just now.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied the officer, “I did not speak arrogantly to you; I\r\nsimply, but rigorously, obeyed instructions. I was commanded to follow\r\nyou. I follow you. I am directed not to allow you to communicate with\r\nany one without taking cognizance of what you do; I am in duty bound,\r\naccordingly, to overhear your conversations.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan trembled with rage, and Porthos and Aramis, who heard this\r\ndialogue, trembled likewise, but with uneasiness and fear. D’Artagnan,\r\nbiting his mustache with that vivacity which denoted in him\r\nexasperation, closely to be followed by an explosion, approached the\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he, in a low voice, so much the more impressive, that,\r\naffecting calm, it threatened tempest--“monsieur, when I sent a canoe\r\nhither, you wished to know what I wrote to the defenders of Belle-Isle.\r\nYou produced an order to that effect; and, in my turn, I instantly\r\nshowed you the note I had written. When the skipper of the boat sent by\r\nme returned, when I received the reply of these two gentlemen” (and\r\nhe pointed to Aramis and Porthos), “you heard every word of what the\r\nmessenger said. All that was plainly in your orders, all that was well\r\nexecuted, very punctually, was it not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur,” stammered the officer; “yes, without doubt, but--”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” continued D’Artagnan, growing warm--“monsieur, when I\r\nmanifested the intention of quitting my vessel to cross to Belle-Isle,\r\nyou demanded to accompany me; I did not hesitate; I brought you with me.\r\nYou are now at Belle-Isle, are you not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur; but--”\r\n\r\n“But--the question no longer is of M. Colbert, who has given you that\r\norder, or of whomsoever in the world you are following the instructions;\r\nthe question now is of a man who is a clog upon M. d’Artagnan, and who\r\nis alone with M. d’Artagnan upon steps whose feet are bathed by thirty\r\nfeet of salt water; a bad position for that man, a bad position,\r\nmonsieur! I warn you.”\r\n\r\n“But, monsieur, if I am a restraint upon you,” said the officer,\r\ntimidly, and almost faintly, “it is my duty which--”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, you have had the misfortune, either you or those that sent\r\nyou, to insult me. It is done. I cannot seek redress from those who\r\nemploy you,--they are unknown to me, or are at too great a distance. But\r\nyou are under my hand, and I swear that if you make one step behind me\r\nwhen I raise my feet to go up to those gentlemen, I swear to you by my\r\nname, I will cleave your head in two with my sword, and pitch you into\r\nthe water. Oh! it will happen! it will happen! I have only been six\r\ntimes angry in my life, monsieur, and all five preceding times _I killed\r\nmy man_.”\r\n\r\nThe officer did not stir; he became pale under this terrible threat, but\r\nreplied with simplicity, “Monsieur, you are wrong in acting against my\r\norders.”\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis, mute and trembling at the top of the parapet, cried\r\nto the musketeer, “Good D’Artagnan, take care!”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan made them a sign to keep silence, raised his foot with\r\nominous calmness to mount the stair, and turned round, sword in hand,\r\nto see if the officer followed him. The officer made a sign of the cross\r\nand stepped up. Porthos and Aramis, who knew their D’Artagnan, uttered\r\na cry, and rushed down to prevent the blow they thought they already\r\nheard. But D’Artagnan passed his sword into his left hand,--\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he to the officer, in an agitated voice, “you are a\r\nbrave man. You will all the better comprehend what I am going to say to\r\nyou now.”\r\n\r\n“Speak, Monsieur d’Artagnan, speak,” replied the officer.\r\n\r\n“These gentlemen we have just seen, and against whom you have orders,\r\nare my friends.”\r\n\r\n“I know they are, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“You can understand whether or not I ought to act towards them as your\r\ninstructions prescribe.”\r\n\r\n“I understand your reserve.”\r\n\r\n“Very well; permit me, then, to converse with them without a witness.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan, if I yield to your request, if I do that which\r\nyou beg me, I break my word; but if I do not do it, I disoblige you. I\r\nprefer the one dilemma to the other. Converse with your friends, and do\r\nnot despise me, monsieur, for doing this for _your_ sake, whom I esteem\r\nand honor; do not despise me for committing for you, and you alone, an\r\nunworthy act.” D’Artagnan, much agitated, threw his arm round the\r\nneck of the young man, and then went up to his friends. The officer,\r\nenveloped in his cloak, sat down on the damp, weed-covered steps.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said D’Artagnan to his friends, “such is my position, judge for\r\nyourselves.” All three embraced as in the glorious days of their youth.\r\n\r\n“What is the meaning of all these preparations?” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“You ought to have a suspicion of what they signify,” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Not any, I assure you, my dear captain; for, in fact, I have done\r\nnothing, no more has Aramis,” the worthy baron hastened to say.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan darted a reproachful look at the prelate, which penetrated\r\nthat hardened heart.\r\n\r\n“Dear Porthos!” cried the bishop of Vannes.\r\n\r\n“You see what is being done against you,” said D’Artagnan; “interception\r\nof all boats coming to or going from Belle-Isle. Your means of transport\r\nseized. If you had endeavored to fly, you would have fallen into the\r\nhands of the cruisers that plow the sea in all directions, on the\r\nwatch for you. The king wants you to be taken, and he will take you.”\r\n D’Artagnan tore at his gray mustache. Aramis grew somber, Porthos angry.\r\n\r\n“My idea was this,” continued D’Artagnan: “to make you both come on\r\nboard, to keep you near me, and restore you your liberty. But now, who\r\ncan say, when I return to my ship, I may not find a superior; that I may\r\nnot find secret orders which will take from me my command, and give it\r\nto another, who will dispose of me and you without hope of help?”\r\n\r\n“We must remain at Belle-Isle,” said Aramis, resolutely; “and I assure\r\nyou, for my part, I will not surrender easily.” Porthos said nothing.\r\nD’Artagnan remarked the silence of his friend.\r\n\r\n“I have another trial to make of this officer, of this brave fellow who\r\naccompanies me, and whose courageous resistance makes me very happy;\r\nfor it denotes an honest man, who, though an enemy, is a thousand times\r\nbetter than a complaisant coward. Let us try to learn from him what his\r\ninstructions are, and what his orders permit or forbid.”\r\n\r\n“Let us try,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan went to the parapet, leaned over towards the steps of the\r\nmole, and called the officer, who immediately came up. “Monsieur,”\r\n said D’Artagnan, after having exchanged the cordial courtesies natural\r\nbetween gentlemen who know and appreciate each other, “monsieur, if I\r\nwished to take away these gentlemen from here, what would you do?”\r\n\r\n“I should not oppose it, monsieur; but having direct explicit orders to\r\nput them under guard, I should detain them.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“That’s all over,” said Aramis, gloomily. Porthos did not stir.\r\n\r\n“But still take Porthos,” said the bishop of Vannes. “He can prove to\r\nthe king, and I will help him do so, and you too, Monsieur d’Artagnan,\r\nthat he had nothing to do with this affair.”\r\n\r\n“Hum!” said D’Artagnan. “Will you come? Will you follow me, Porthos? The\r\nking is merciful.”\r\n\r\n“I want time for reflection,” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“You will remain here, then?”\r\n\r\n“Until fresh orders,” said Aramis, with vivacity.\r\n\r\n“Until we have an idea,” resumed D’Artagnan; “and I now believe that\r\nwill not be long, for I have one already.”\r\n\r\n“Let us say adieu, then,” said Aramis; “but in truth, my good Porthos,\r\nyou ought to go.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the latter, laconically.\r\n\r\n“As you please,” replied Aramis, a little wounded in his\r\nsusceptibilities at the morose tone of his companion. “Only I am\r\nreassured by the promise of an idea from D’Artagnan, an idea I fancy I\r\nhave divined.”\r\n\r\n“Let us see,” said the musketeer, placing his ear near Aramis’s mouth.\r\nThe latter spoke several words rapidly, to which D’Artagnan replied,\r\n“That is it, precisely.”\r\n\r\n“Infallible!” cried Aramis.\r\n\r\n“During the first emotion this resolution will cause, take care of\r\nyourself, Aramis.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! don’t be afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Now, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan to the officer, “thanks, a thousand\r\nthanks! You have made yourself three friends for life.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” added Aramis. Porthos alone said nothing, but merely bowed.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, having tenderly embraced his two old friends, left\r\nBelle-Isle with the inseparable companion with whom M. Colbert had\r\nsaddled him. Thus, with the exception of the explanation with which the\r\nworthy Porthos had been willing to be satisfied, nothing had changed in\r\nappearance in the fate of one or the other, “Only,” said Aramis, “there\r\nis D’Artagnan’s idea.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan did not return on board without profoundly analyzing the idea\r\nhe had discovered. Now, we know that whatever D’Artagnan did examine,\r\naccording to custom, daylight was certain to illuminate. As to the\r\nofficer, now grown mute again, he had full time for meditation.\r\nTherefore, on putting his foot on board his vessel, moored within\r\ncannon-shot of the island, the captain of the musketeers had already got\r\ntogether all his means, offensive and defensive.\r\n\r\nHe immediately assembled his council, which consisted of the officers\r\nserving under his orders. These were eight in number; a chief of the\r\nmaritime forces; a major directing the artillery; an engineer, the\r\nofficer we are acquainted with, and four lieutenants. Having assembled\r\nthem, D’Artagnan arose, took of his hat, and addressed them thus:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, I have been to reconnoiter Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and I have\r\nfound in it a good and solid garrison; moreover, preparations are made\r\nfor a defense that may prove troublesome. I therefore intend to send for\r\ntwo of the principal officers of the place, that we may converse with\r\nthem. Having separated them from their troops and cannon, we shall be\r\nbetter able to deal with them; particularly by reasoning with them. Is\r\nnot this your opinion, gentlemen?”\r\n\r\nThe major of artillery rose.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he, with respect, but firmness, “I have heard you say\r\nthat the place is preparing to make a troublesome defense. The place is\r\nthen, as you know, determined on rebellion?”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan was visibly put out by this reply; but he was not the man to\r\nallow himself to be subdued by a trifle, and resumed:\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he, “your reply is just. But you are ignorant that\r\nBelle-Isle is a fief of M. Fouquet’s, and that former monarchs gave the\r\nright to the seigneurs of Belle-Isle to arm their people.” The major\r\nmade a movement. “Oh! do not interrupt me,” continued D’Artagnan. “You\r\nare going to tell me that that right to arm themselves against the\r\nEnglish was not a right to arm themselves against their king. But it is\r\nnot M. Fouquet, I suppose, who holds Belle-Isle at this moment, since\r\nI arrested M. Fouquet the day before yesterday. Now the inhabitants and\r\ndefenders of Belle-Isle know nothing of this arrest. You would announce\r\nit to them in vain. It is a thing so unheard-of and extraordinary, so\r\nunexpected, that they would not believe you. A Breton serves his master,\r\nand not his masters; he serves his master till he has seen him dead. Now\r\nthe Bretons, as far as I know, have not seen the body of M. Fouquet. It\r\nis not, then, surprising they hold out against that which is neither M.\r\nFouquet nor his signature.”\r\n\r\nThe major bowed in token of assent.\r\n\r\n“That is why,” continued D’Artagnan, “I propose to cause two of the\r\nprincipal officers of the garrison to come on board my vessel. They will\r\nsee you, gentlemen; they will see the forces we have at our disposal;\r\nthey will consequently know to what they have to trust, and the fate\r\nthat attends them, in case of rebellion. We will affirm to them, upon\r\nour honor, that M. Fouquet is a prisoner, and that all resistance can\r\nonly be prejudicial to them. We will tell them that at the first cannon\r\nfired, there will be no further hope of mercy from the king. Then, or so\r\nat least I trust, they will resist no longer. They will yield up without\r\nfighting, and we shall have a place given up to us in a friendly way\r\nwhich it might cost prodigious efforts to subdue.”\r\n\r\nThe officer who had followed D’Artagnan to Belle-Isle was preparing to\r\nspeak, but D’Artagnan interrupted him.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know what you are going to tell me, monsieur; I know that there\r\nis an order of the king’s to prevent all secret communications with\r\nthe defenders of Belle-Isle, and that is exactly why I do not offer to\r\ncommunicate except in presence of my staff.”\r\n\r\nAnd D’Artagnan made an inclination of the head to his officers, who knew\r\nhim well enough to attach a certain value to the condescension.\r\n\r\nThe officers looked at each other as if to read each other’s opinions in\r\ntheir eyes, with the intention of evidently acting, should they agree,\r\naccording to the desire of D’Artagnan. And already the latter saw with\r\njoy that the result of their consent would be sending a bark to Porthos\r\nand Aramis, when the king’s officer drew from a pocket a folded paper,\r\nwhich he placed in the hands of D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nThis paper bore upon its superscription the number 1.\r\n\r\n“What, more!” murmured the surprised captain.\r\n\r\n“Read, monsieur,” said the officer, with a courtesy that was not free\r\nfrom sadness.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, full of mistrust, unfolded the paper, and read these words:\r\n“Prohibition to M. d’Artagnan to assemble any council whatever, or to\r\ndeliberate in any way before Belle-Isle be surrendered and the prisoners\r\nshot. Signed--LOUIS.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan repressed the quiver of impatience that ran through his whole\r\nbody, and with a gracious smile:\r\n\r\n“That is well, monsieur,” said he; “the king’s orders shall be complied\r\nwith.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIV. Result of the Ideas of the King, and the Ideas of\r\nD’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nThe blow was direct. It was severe, mortal. D’Artagnan, furious at\r\nhaving been anticipated by an idea of the king’s, did not despair,\r\nhowever, even yet; and reflecting upon the idea he had brought back from\r\nBelle-Isle, he elicited therefrom novel means of safety for his friends.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, suddenly, “since the king has charged some other\r\nthan myself with his secret orders, it must be because I no longer\r\npossess his confidence, and I should really be unworthy of it if I had\r\nthe courage to hold a command subject to so many injurious suspicions.\r\nTherefore I will go immediately and carry my resignation to the king.\r\nI tender it before you all, enjoining you all to fall back with me upon\r\nthe coast of France, in such a way as not to compromise the safety of\r\nthe forces his majesty has confided to me. For this purpose, return all\r\nto your posts; within an hour, we shall have the ebb of the tide. To\r\nyour posts, gentlemen! I suppose,” added he, on seeing that all prepared\r\nto obey him, except the surveillant officer, “you have no orders to\r\nobject, this time?”\r\n\r\nAnd D’Artagnan almost triumphed while speaking these words. This plan\r\nwould prove the safety of his friends. The blockade once raised, they\r\nmight embark immediately, and set sail for England or Spain, without\r\nfear of being molested. Whilst they were making their escape, D’Artagnan\r\nwould return to the king; would justify his return by the indignation\r\nwhich the mistrust of Colbert had raised in him; he would be sent back\r\nwith full powers, and he would take Belle-Isle; that is to say, the\r\ncage, after the birds had flown. But to this plan the officer opposed a\r\nfurther order of the king’s. It was thus conceived:\r\n\r\n“From the moment M. d’Artagnan shall have manifested the desire of\r\ngiving in his resignation, he shall no longer be reckoned leader of the\r\nexpedition, and every officer placed under his orders shall be held to\r\nno longer obey him. Moreover, the said Monsieur d’Artagnan, having lost\r\nthat quality of leader of the army sent against Belle-Isle, shall set\r\nout immediately for France, accompanied by the officer who will have\r\nremitted the message to him, and who will consider him a prisoner for\r\nwhom he is answerable.”\r\n\r\nBrave and careless as he was, D’Artagnan turned pale. Everything had\r\nbeen calculated with a depth of precognition which, for the first time\r\nin thirty years, recalled to him the solid foresight and inflexible\r\nlogic of the great cardinal. He leaned his head on his hand, thoughtful,\r\nscarcely breathing. “If I were to put this order in my pocket,” thought\r\nhe, “who would know it, what would prevent my doing it? Before the king\r\nhad had time to be informed, I should have saved those poor fellows\r\nyonder. Let us exercise some small audacity! My head is not one of those\r\nthe executioner strikes off for disobedience. We will disobey!” But at\r\nthe moment he was about to adopt this plan, he saw the officers around\r\nhim reading similar orders, which the passive agent of the thoughts of\r\nthat infernal Colbert had distributed to them. This contingency of his\r\ndisobedience had been foreseen--as all the rest had been.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the officer, coming up to him, “I await your good\r\npleasure to depart.”\r\n\r\n“I am ready, monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan, grinding his teeth.\r\n\r\nThe officer immediately ordered a canoe to receive M. d’Artagnan and\r\nhimself. At sight of this he became almost distraught with rage.\r\n\r\n“How,” stammered he, “will you carry on the directions of the different\r\ncorps?”\r\n\r\n“When you are gone, monsieur,” replied the commander of the fleet, “it\r\nis to me the command of the whole is committed.”\r\n\r\n“Then, monsieur,” rejoined Colbert’s man, addressing the new leader, “it\r\nis for you that this last order remitted to me is intended. Let us see\r\nyour powers.”\r\n\r\n“Here they are,” said the officer, exhibiting the royal signature.\r\n\r\n“Here are your instructions,” replied the officer, placing the folded\r\npaper in his hands; and turning round towards D’Artagnan, “Come,\r\nmonsieur,” said he, in an agitated voice (such despair did he behold in\r\nthat man of iron), “do me the favor to depart at once.”\r\n\r\n“Immediately!” articulated D’Artagnan, feebly, subdued, crushed by\r\nimplacable impossibility.\r\n\r\nAnd he painfully subsided into the little boat, which started, favored\r\nby wind and tide, for the coast of France. The king’s guards embarked\r\nwith him. The musketeer still preserved the hope of reaching Nantes\r\nquickly, and of pleading the cause of his friends eloquently enough\r\nto incline the king to mercy. The bark flew like a swallow. D’Artagnan\r\ndistinctly saw the land of France profiled in black against the white\r\nclouds of night.\r\n\r\n“Ah! monsieur,” said he, in a low voice, to the officer to whom, for\r\nan hour, he had ceased speaking, “what would I give to know the\r\ninstructions for the new commander! They are all pacific, are they not?\r\nand--”\r\n\r\nHe did not finish; the thunder of a distant cannon rolled athwart the\r\nwaves, another, and two or three still louder. D’Artagnan shuddered.\r\n\r\n“They have commenced the siege of Belle-Isle,” replied the officer. The\r\ncanoe had just touched the soil of France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLV. The Ancestors of Porthos.\r\n\r\nWhen D’Artagnan left Aramis and Porthos, the latter returned to the\r\nprincipal fort, in order to converse with greater liberty. Porthos,\r\nstill thoughtful, was a restraint on Aramis, whose mind had never felt\r\nitself more free.\r\n\r\n“Dear Porthos,” said he, suddenly, “I will explain D’Artagnan’s idea to\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“What idea, Aramis?”\r\n\r\n“An idea to which we shall owe our liberty within twelve hours.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! indeed!” said Porthos, much astonished. “Let us hear it.”\r\n\r\n“Did you remark, in the scene our friend had with the officer, that\r\ncertain orders constrained him with regard to us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I did notice that.”\r\n\r\n“Well! D’Artagnan is going to give in his resignation to the king, and\r\nduring the confusion that will result from his absence, we will get\r\naway, or rather you will get away, Porthos, if there is possibility of\r\nflight for only one.”\r\n\r\nHere Porthos shook his head and replied: “We will escape together,\r\nAramis, or we will stay together.”\r\n\r\n“Thine is a right, a generous heart,” said Aramis, “only your melancholy\r\nuneasiness affects me.”\r\n\r\n“I am not uneasy,” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Then you are angry with me.”\r\n\r\n“I am not angry with you.”\r\n\r\n“Then why, my friend, do you put on such a dismal countenance?”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you; I am making my will.” And while saying these words,\r\nthe good Porthos looked sadly in the face of Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Your will!” cried the bishop. “What, then! do you think yourself lost?”\r\n\r\n“I feel fatigued. It is the first time, and there is a custom in our\r\nfamily.”\r\n\r\n“What is it, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“My grandfather was a man twice as strong as I am.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” said Aramis; “then your grandfather must have been Samson\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\n“No; his name was Antoine. Well! he was about my age, when, setting\r\nout one day for the chase, he felt his legs weak, the man who had never\r\nknown what weakness was before.”\r\n\r\n“What was the meaning of that fatigue, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing good, as you will see; for having set out, complaining still of\r\nweakness of the legs, he met a wild boar, which made head against him;\r\nhe missed him with his arquebuse, and was ripped up by the beast and\r\ndied immediately.”\r\n\r\n“There is no reason in that why you should alarm yourself, dear\r\nPorthos.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you will see. My father was as strong again as I am. He was a rough\r\nsoldier, under Henry III. and Henry IV.; his name was not Antoine, but\r\nGaspard, the same as M. de Coligny. Always on horseback, he had never\r\nknown what lassitude was. One evening, as he rose from table, his legs\r\nfailed him.”\r\n\r\n“He had supped heartily, perhaps,” said Aramis, “and that was why he\r\nstaggered.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! A friend of M. de Bassompierre, nonsense! No, no, he was\r\nastonished at this lassitude, and said to my mother, who laughed at him,\r\n‘Would not one believe I was going to meet with a wild boar, as the late\r\nM. du Vallon, my father did?’”\r\n\r\n“Well?” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Well, having this weakness, my father insisted upon going down into the\r\ngarden, instead of going to bed; his foot slipped on the first stair,\r\nthe staircase was steep; my father fell against a stone in which an iron\r\nhinge was fixed. The hinge gashed his temple; and he was stretched out\r\ndead upon the spot.”\r\n\r\nAramis raised his eyes to his friend: “These are two extraordinary\r\ncircumstances,” said he; “let us not infer that there may succeed a\r\nthird. It is not becoming in a man of your strength to be superstitious,\r\nmy brave Porthos. Besides, when were your legs known to fail? Never have\r\nyou stood so firm, so haughtily; why, you could carry a house on your\r\nshoulders.”\r\n\r\n“At this moment,” said Porthos, “I feel myself pretty active; but at\r\ntimes I vacillate; I sink; and lately this phenomenon, as you say, has\r\noccurred four times. I will not say this frightens me, but it annoys me.\r\nLife is an agreeable thing. I have money; I have fine estates; I have\r\nhorses that I love; I have also friends that I love: D’Artagnan, Athos,\r\nRaoul, and you.”\r\n\r\nThe admirable Porthos did not even take the trouble to dissimulate in\r\nthe very presence of Aramis the rank he gave him in his friendship.\r\nAramis pressed his hand: “We will still live many years,” said he, “to\r\npreserve to the world such specimens of its rarest men. Trust yourself\r\nto me, my friend; we have no reply from D’Artagnan, that is a good sign.\r\nHe must have given orders to get the vessels together and clear the\r\nseas. On my part I have just issued directions that a bark should be\r\nrolled on rollers to the mouth of the great cavern of Locmaria, which\r\nyou know, where we have so often lain in wait for the foxes.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and which terminates at the little creek by a trench where we\r\ndiscovered the day that splendid fox escaped that way.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely. In case of misfortunes, a bark is to be concealed for us in\r\nthat cavern; indeed, it must be there by this time. We will wait for a\r\nfavorable moment, and during the night we will go to sea!”\r\n\r\n“That is a grand idea. What shall we gain by it?”\r\n\r\n“We shall gain this--nobody knows that grotto, or rather its issue,\r\nexcept ourselves and two or three hunters of the island; we shall gain\r\nthis--that if the island is occupied, the scouts, seeing no bark upon\r\nthe shore, will never imagine we can escape, and will cease to watch.”\r\n\r\n“I understand.”\r\n\r\n“Well! that weakness in the legs?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! better, much, just now.”\r\n\r\n“You see, then, plainly, that everything conspires to give us quietude\r\nand hope. D’Artagnan will sweep the sea and leave us free. No royal\r\nfleet or descent to be dreaded. _Vive Dieu!_ Porthos, we have still\r\nhalf a century of magnificent adventure before us, and if I once touch\r\nSpanish ground, I swear to you,” added the bishop with terrible energy,\r\n“that your brevet of duke is not such a chance as it is said to be.”\r\n\r\n“We live by hope,” said Porthos, enlivened by the warmth of his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\nAll at once a cry resounded in their ears: “To arms! to arms!”\r\n\r\nThis cry, repeated by a hundred throats, piercing the chamber where the\r\ntwo friends were conversing, carried surprise to one, and uneasiness to\r\nthe other. Aramis opened the window; he saw a crowd of people running\r\nwith flambeaux. Women were seeking places of safety, the armed\r\npopulation were hastening to their posts.\r\n\r\n“The fleet! the fleet!” cried a soldier, who recognized Aramis.\r\n\r\n“The fleet?” repeated the latter.\r\n\r\n“Within half cannon-shot,” continued the soldier.\r\n\r\n“To arms!” cried Aramis.\r\n\r\n“To arms!” repeated Porthos, formidably. And both rushed forth towards\r\nthe mole to place themselves within the shelter of the batteries. Boats,\r\nladen with soldiers, were seen approaching; and in three directions, for\r\nthe purpose of landing at three points at once.\r\n\r\n“What must be done?” said an officer of the guard.\r\n\r\n“Stop them; and if they persist, fire!” said Aramis.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later, the cannonade commenced. These were the shots that\r\nD’Artagnan had heard as he landed in France. But the boats were too\r\nnear the mole to allow the cannon to aim correctly. They landed, and the\r\ncombat commenced hand to hand.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter, Porthos?” said Aramis to his friend.\r\n\r\n“Nothing! nothing!--only my legs; it is really incomprehensible!--they\r\nwill be better when we charge.” In fact, Porthos and Aramis did\r\ncharge with such vigor, and so thoroughly animated their men, that the\r\nroyalists re-embarked precipitately, without gaining anything but the\r\nwounds they carried away.\r\n\r\n“Eh! but Porthos,” cried Aramis, “we must have a prisoner, quick!\r\nquick!” Porthos bent over the stair of the mole, and seized by the nape\r\nof the neck one of the officers of the royal army who was waiting to\r\nembark till all his people should be in the boat. The arm of the giant\r\nlifted up his prey, which served him as a buckler, and he recovered\r\nhimself without a shot being fired at him.\r\n\r\n“Here is a prisoner for you,” said Porthos coolly to Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Well!” cried the latter, laughing, “did you not calumniate your legs?”\r\n\r\n“It was not with my legs I captured him,” said Porthos, “it was with my\r\narms!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVI. The Son of Biscarrat.\r\n\r\nThe Bretons of the Isle were very proud of this victory; Aramis did not\r\nencourage them in the feeling.\r\n\r\n“What will happen,” said he to Porthos, when everybody was gone home,\r\n“will be that the anger of the king will be roused by the account of the\r\nresistance; and that these brave people will be decimated or shot when\r\nthey are taken, which cannot fail to take place.”\r\n\r\n“From which it results, then,” said Porthos, “that what we have done is\r\nof not the slightest use.”\r\n\r\n“For the moment it may be,” replied the bishop, “for we have a prisoner\r\nfrom whom we shall learn what our enemies are preparing to do.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, let us interrogate the prisoner,” said Porthos, “and the means of\r\nmaking him speak are very simple. We are going to supper; we will invite\r\nhim to join us; as he drinks he will talk.”\r\n\r\nThis was done. The officer was at first rather uneasy, but became\r\nreassured on seeing what sort of men he had to deal with. He gave,\r\nwithout having any fear of compromising himself, all the details\r\nimaginable of the resignation and departure of D’Artagnan. He explained\r\nhow, after that departure, the new leader of the expedition had ordered\r\na surprise upon Belle-Isle. There his explanations stopped. Aramis\r\nand Porthos exchanged a glance that evinced their despair. No more\r\ndependence to be placed now on D’Artagnan’s fertile imagination--no\r\nfurther resource in the event of defeat. Aramis, continuing his\r\ninterrogations, asked the prisoner what the leaders of the expedition\r\ncontemplated doing with the leaders of Belle-Isle.\r\n\r\n“The orders are,” replied he, “to kill _during_ combat, or hang\r\n_afterwards_.”\r\n\r\nPorthos and Aramis looked at each other again, and the color mounted to\r\ntheir faces.\r\n\r\n“I am too light for the gallows,” replied Aramis; “people like me are\r\nnot hung.”\r\n\r\n“And I am too heavy,” said Porthos; “people like me break the cord.”\r\n\r\n“I am sure,” said the prisoner, gallantly, “that we could have\r\nguaranteed you the exact kind of death you preferred.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand thanks!” said Aramis, seriously. Porthos bowed.\r\n\r\n“One more cup of wine to your health,” said he, drinking himself. From\r\none subject to another the chat with the officer was prolonged. He was\r\nan intelligent gentleman, and suffered himself to be led on by the charm\r\nof Aramis’s wit and Porthos’s cordial _bonhomie_.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said he, “if I address a question to you; but men who are\r\nin their sixth bottle have a clear right to forget themselves a little.”\r\n\r\n“Address it!” cried Porthos; “address it!”\r\n\r\n“Speak,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Were you not, gentlemen, both in the musketeers of the late king?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur, and amongst the best of them, if you please,” said\r\nPorthos.\r\n\r\n“That is true; I should say even the best of all soldiers, messieurs, if\r\nI did not fear to offend the memory of my father.”\r\n\r\n“Of your father?” cried Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Do you know what my name is?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ no, monsieur; but you can tell us, and--”\r\n\r\n“I am called Georges de Biscarrat.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried Porthos, in his turn. “Biscarrat! Do you remember that name,\r\nAramis?”\r\n\r\n“Biscarrat!” reflected the bishop. “It seems to me--”\r\n\r\n“Try to recollect, monsieur,” said the officer.\r\n\r\n“_Pardieu!_ that won’t take me long,” said Porthos. “Biscarrat--called\r\nCardinal--one of the four who interrupted us on the day on which we\r\nformed our friendship with D’Artagnan, sword in hand.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“The only one,” cried Aramis, eagerly, “we could not scratch.”\r\n\r\n“Consequently, a capital blade?” said the prisoner.\r\n\r\n“That’s true! most true!” exclaimed both friends together. “_Ma foi!_\r\nMonsieur Biscarrat, we are delighted to make the acquaintance of such a\r\nbrave man’s son.”\r\n\r\nBiscarrat pressed the hands held out by the two musketeers. Aramis\r\nlooked at Porthos as much as to say, “Here is a man who will help us,”\r\n and without delay,--“Confess, monsieur,” said he, “that it is good to\r\nhave once been a good man.”\r\n\r\n“My father always said so, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Confess, likewise, that it is a sad circumstance in which you find\r\nyourself, of falling in with men destined to be shot or hung, and\r\nto learn that these men are old acquaintances, in fact, hereditary\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you are not reserved for such a frightful fate as that, messieurs\r\nand friends!” said the young man, warmly.\r\n\r\n“Bah! you said so yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I said so just now, when I did not know you; but now that I know you, I\r\nsay--you will evade this dismal fate, if you wish!”\r\n\r\n“How--if we wish?” echoed Aramis, whose eyes beamed with intelligence as\r\nhe looked alternately at the prisoner and Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Provided,” continued Porthos, looking, in his turn, with noble\r\nintrepidity, at M. Biscarrat and the bishop--“provided nothing\r\ndisgraceful be required of us.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing at all will be required of you, gentlemen,” replied the\r\nofficer--“what should they ask of you? If they find you they will kill\r\nyou, that is a predetermined thing; try, then, gentlemen, to prevent\r\ntheir finding you.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think I am mistaken,” said Porthos, with dignity; “but it\r\nappears evident to me that if they want to find us, they must come and\r\nseek us here.”\r\n\r\n“In that you are perfectly right, my worthy friend,” replied Aramis,\r\nconstantly consulting with his looks the countenance of Biscarrat, who\r\nhad grown silent and constrained. “You wish, Monsieur de Biscarrat, to\r\nsay something to us, to make us some overture, and you dare not--is that\r\ntrue?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! gentlemen and friends! it is because by speaking I betray the\r\nwatchword. But, hark! I hear a voice that frees mine by dominating it.”\r\n\r\n“Cannon!” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Cannon and musketry, too!” cried the bishop.\r\n\r\nOn hearing at a distance, among the rocks, these sinister reports of a\r\ncombat which they thought had ceased:\r\n\r\n“What can that be?” asked Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Eh! _Pardieu!_” cried Aramis; “that is just what I expected.”\r\n\r\n“What is that?”\r\n\r\n“That the attack made by you was nothing but a feint; is not that true,\r\nmonsieur? And whilst your companions allowed themselves to be repulsed,\r\nyou were certain of effecting a landing on the other side of the\r\nisland.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! several, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“We are lost, then,” said the bishop of Vannes, quietly.\r\n\r\n“Lost! that is possible,” replied the Seigneur de Pierrefonds, “but we\r\nare not taken or hung.” And so saying, he rose from the table, went to\r\nthe wall, and coolly took down his sword and pistols, which he examined\r\nwith the care of an old soldier who is preparing for battle, and who\r\nfeels that life, in a great measure, depends upon the excellence and\r\nright conditions of his arms.\r\n\r\nAt the report of the cannon, at the news of the surprise which might\r\ndeliver up the island to the royal troops, the terrified crowd rushed\r\nprecipitately to the fort to demand assistance and advice from their\r\nleaders. Aramis, pale and downcast, between two flambeaux, showed\r\nhimself at the window which looked into the principal court, full of\r\nsoldiers waiting for orders and bewildered inhabitants imploring succor.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” said D’Herblay, in a grave and sonorous voice, “M.\r\nFouquet, your protector, your friend, you father, has been arrested by\r\nan order of the king, and thrown into the Bastile.” A sustained yell of\r\nvengeful fury came floating up to the window at which the bishop stood,\r\nand enveloped him in a magnetic field.\r\n\r\n“Avenge Monsieur Fouquet!” cried the most excited of his hearers, “death\r\nto the royalists!”\r\n\r\n“No, my friends,” replied Aramis, solemnly; “no, my friends; no\r\nresistance. The king is master in his kingdom. The king is the mandatory\r\nof God. The king and God have struck M. Fouquet. Humble yourselves\r\nbefore the hand of God. Love God and the king, who have struck M.\r\nFouquet. But do not avenge your seigneur, do not think of avenging him.\r\nYou would sacrifice yourselves in vain--you, your wives and children,\r\nyour property, your liberty. Lay down your arms, my friends--lay down\r\nyour arms! since the king commands you so to do--and retire peaceably to\r\nyour dwellings. It is I who ask you to do so; it is I who beg you to do\r\nso; it is I who now, in the hour of need, command you to do so, in the\r\nname of M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\nThe crowd collected under the window uttered a prolonged roar of anger\r\nand terror. “The soldiers of Louis XIV. have reached the island,”\r\n continued Aramis. “From this time it would no longer be a fight betwixt\r\nthem and you--it would be a massacre. Begone, then, begone, and forget;\r\nthis time I command you, in the name of the Lord of Hosts!”\r\n\r\nThe mutineers retired slowly, submissive, silent.\r\n\r\n“Ah! what have you just been saying, my friend?” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said Biscarrat to the bishop, “you may save all these\r\ninhabitants, but thus you will neither save yourself nor your friend.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur de Biscarrat,” said the bishop of Vannes, with a singular\r\naccent of nobility and courtesy, “Monsieur de Biscarrat, be kind enough\r\nto resume your liberty.”\r\n\r\n“I am very willing to do so, monsieur; but--”\r\n\r\n“That would render us a service, for when announcing to the king’s\r\nlieutenant the submission of the islanders, you will perhaps obtain some\r\ngrace for us on informing him of the manner in which that submission has\r\nbeen effected.”\r\n\r\n“Grace!” replied Porthos with flashing eyes, “what is the meaning of\r\nthat word?”\r\n\r\nAramis touched the elbow of his friend roughly, as he had been\r\naccustomed to do in the days of their youth, when he wanted to warn\r\nPorthos that he had committed, or was about to commit, a blunder.\r\nPorthos understood him, and was silent immediately.\r\n\r\n“I will go, messieurs,” replied Biscarrat, a little surprised likewise\r\nat the word “grace” pronounced by the haughty musketeer, of and to whom,\r\nbut a few minutes before, he had related with so much enthusiasm the\r\nheroic exploits with which his father had delighted him.\r\n\r\n“Go, then, Monsieur Biscarrat,” said Aramis, bowing to him, “and at\r\nparting receive the expression of our entire gratitude.”\r\n\r\n“But you, messieurs, you whom I think it an honor to call my friends,\r\nsince you have been willing to accept that title, what will become of\r\nyou in the meantime?” replied the officer, very much agitated at taking\r\nleave of the two ancient adversaries of his father.\r\n\r\n“We will wait here.”\r\n\r\n“But, _mon Dieu!_--the order is precise and formal.”\r\n\r\n“I am bishop of Vannes, Monsieur de Biscarrat; and they no more shoot a\r\nbishop than they hang a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes, monsieur--yes, monseigneur,” replied Biscarrat; “it is true,\r\nyou are right, there is still that chance for you. Then, I will depart,\r\nI will repair to the commander of the expedition, the king’s lieutenant.\r\nAdieu! then, messieurs, or rather, to meet again, I hope.”\r\n\r\nThe worthy officer, jumping upon a horse given him by Aramis, departed\r\nin the direction of the sound of cannon, which, by surging the crowd\r\ninto the fort, had interrupted the conversation of the two friends with\r\ntheir prisoner. Aramis watched the departure, and when left alone with\r\nPorthos:\r\n\r\n“Well, do you comprehend?” said he.\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ no.”\r\n\r\n“Did not Biscarrat inconvenience you here?”\r\n\r\n“No; he is a brave fellow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but the grotto of Locmaria--is it necessary all the world should\r\nknow it?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! that is true, that is true; I comprehend. We are going to escape by\r\nthe cavern.”\r\n\r\n“If you please,” cried Aramis, gayly. “Forward, friend Porthos; our boat\r\nawaits us. King Louis has not caught us--_yet_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVII. The Grotto of Locmaria.\r\n\r\nThe cavern of Locmaria was sufficiently distant from the mole to render\r\nit necessary for our friends to husband their strength in order to\r\nreach it. Besides, night was advancing; midnight had struck at the fort.\r\nPorthos and Aramis were loaded with money and arms. They walked, then,\r\nacross the heath, which stretched between the mole and the cavern,\r\nlistening to every noise, in order better to avoid an ambush. From time\r\nto time, on the road which they had carefully left on their left, passed\r\nfugitives coming from the interior, at the news of the landing of the\r\nroyal troops. Aramis and Porthos, concealed behind some projecting mass\r\nof rock, collected the words that escaped from the poor people, who\r\nfled, trembling, carrying with them their most valuable effects, and\r\ntried, whilst listening to their complaints, to gather something from\r\nthem for their own interest. At length, after a rapid race, frequently\r\ninterrupted by prudent stoppages, they reached the deep grottoes, in\r\nwhich the prophetic bishop of Vannes had taken care to have secreted a\r\nbark capable of keeping the sea at this fine season.\r\n\r\n“My good friend,” said Porthos, panting vigorously, “we have arrived, it\r\nseems. But I thought you spoke of three men, three servants, who were to\r\naccompany us. I don’t see them--where are they?”\r\n\r\n“Why should you see them, Porthos?” replied Aramis. “They are certainly\r\nwaiting for us in the cavern, and, no doubt, are resting, having\r\naccomplished their rough and difficult task.”\r\n\r\nAramis stopped Porthos, who was preparing to enter the cavern. “Will you\r\nallow me, my friend,” said he to the giant, “to pass in first? I know\r\nthe signal I have given to these men; who, not hearing it, would be very\r\nlikely to fire upon you or slash away with their knives in the dark.”\r\n\r\n“Go on, then, Aramis; go on--go first; you impersonate wisdom and\r\nforesight; go. Ah! there is that fatigue again, of which I spoke to you.\r\nIt has just seized me afresh.”\r\n\r\nAramis left Porthos sitting at the entrance of the grotto, and bowing\r\nhis head, he penetrated into the interior of the cavern, imitating the\r\ncry of the owl. A little plaintive cooing, a scarcely distinct echo,\r\nreplied from the depths of the cave. Aramis pursued his way cautiously,\r\nand soon was stopped by the same kind of cry as he had first uttered,\r\nwithin ten paces of him.\r\n\r\n“Are you there, Yves?” said the bishop.\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur; Goenne is here likewise. His son accompanies us.”\r\n\r\n“That is well. Are all things ready?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monseigneur.”\r\n\r\n“Go to the entrance of the grottoes, my good Yves, and you will there\r\nfind the Seigneur de Pierrefonds, who is resting after the fatigue of\r\nour journey. And if he should happen not to be able to walk, lift him\r\nup, and bring him hither to me.”\r\n\r\nThe three men obeyed. But the recommendation given to his servants was\r\nsuperfluous. Porthos, refreshed, had already commenced the descent, and\r\nhis heavy step resounded amongst the cavities, formed and supported by\r\ncolumns of porphyry and granite. As soon as the Seigneur de Bracieux had\r\nrejoined the bishop, the Bretons lighted a lantern with which they were\r\nfurnished, and Porthos assured his friend that he felt as strong again\r\nas ever.\r\n\r\n“Let us inspect the boat,” said Aramis, “and satisfy ourselves at once\r\nwhat it will hold.”\r\n\r\n“Do not go too near with the light,” said the patron Yves; “for as you\r\ndesired me, monseigneur, I have placed under the bench of the poop, in\r\nthe coffer you know of, the barrel of powder, and the musket-charges\r\nthat you sent me from the fort.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Aramis; and, taking the lantern himself, he examined\r\nminutely all parts of the canoe, with the precautions of a man who is\r\nneither timid nor ignorant in the face of danger. The canoe was long,\r\nlight, drawing little water, thin of keel; in short, one of those that\r\nhave always been so aptly built at Belle-Isle; a little high in its\r\nsides, solid upon the water, very manageable, furnished with planks\r\nwhich, in uncertain weather, formed a sort of deck over which the waves\r\nmight glide, so as to protect the rowers. In two well-closed coffers,\r\nplaced beneath the benches of the prow and the poop, Aramis found bread,\r\nbiscuit, dried fruits, a quarter of bacon, a good provision of water in\r\nleathern bottles; the whole forming rations sufficient for people who\r\ndid not mean to quit the coast, and would be able to revictual, if\r\nnecessity commanded. The arms, eight muskets, and as many horse-pistols,\r\nwere in good condition, and all loaded. There were additional oars, in\r\ncase of accident, and that little sail called _trinquet_, which assists\r\nthe speed of the canoe at the same time the boatmen row, and is so\r\nuseful when the breeze is slack. When Aramis had seen to all these\r\nthings, and appeared satisfied with the result of his inspection, “Let\r\nus consult Porthos,” said he, “to know if we must endeavor to get the\r\nboat out by the unknown extremity of the grotto, following the descent\r\nand the shade of the cavern, or whether it be better, in the open air,\r\nto make it slide upon its rollers through the bushes, leveling the road\r\nof the little beach, which is but twenty feet high, and gives, at high\r\ntide, three or four fathoms of good water upon a sound bottom.”\r\n\r\n“It must be as you please, monseigneur,” replied the skipper Yves,\r\nrespectfully; “but I don’t believe that by the slope of the cavern, and\r\nin the dark in which we shall be obliged to maneuver our boat, the road\r\nwill be so convenient as the open air. I know the beach well, and can\r\ncertify that it is as smooth as a grass-plot in a garden; the\r\ninterior of the grotto, on the contrary, is rough; without reckoning,\r\nmonseigneur, that at its extremity we shall come to the trench which\r\nleads into the sea, and perhaps the canoe will not pass down it.”\r\n\r\n“I have made my calculation,” said the bishop, “and I am certain it will\r\npass.”\r\n\r\n“So be it; I wish it may, monseigneur,” continued Yves; “but your\r\nhighness knows very well that to make it reach the extremity of the\r\ntrench, there is an enormous stone to be lifted--that under which the\r\nfox always passes, and which closes the trench like a door.”\r\n\r\n“It can be raised,” said Porthos; “that is nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I know that monseigneur has the strength of ten men,” replied Yves;\r\n“but that is giving him a great deal of trouble.”\r\n\r\n“I think the skipper may be right,” said Aramis; “let us try the\r\nopen-air passage.”\r\n\r\n“The more so, monseigneur,” continued the fisherman, “that we should not\r\nbe able to embark before day, it will require so much labor, and that\r\nas soon as daylight appears, a good _vedette_ placed outside the grotto\r\nwould be necessary, indispensable even, to watch the maneuvers of the\r\nlighters or cruisers that are on the look-out for us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, Yves, your reasons are good; we will go by the beach.”\r\n\r\nAnd the three robust Bretons went to the boat, and were beginning to\r\nplace their rollers underneath it to put it in motion, when the distant\r\nbarking of dogs was heard, proceeding from the interior of the island.\r\n\r\nAramis darted out of the grotto, followed by Porthos. Dawn just tinted\r\nwith purple and white the waves and plain; through the dim light,\r\nmelancholy fir-trees waved their tender branches over the pebbles,\r\nand long flights of crows were skimming with their black wings the\r\nshimmering fields of buckwheat. In a quarter of an hour it would be\r\nclear daylight; the wakened birds announced it to all nature. The\r\nbarkings which had been heard, which had stopped the three fishermen\r\nengaged in moving the boat, and had brought Aramis and Porthos out of\r\nthe cavern, now seemed to come from a deep gorge within about a league\r\nof the grotto.\r\n\r\n“It is a pack of hounds,” said Porthos; “the dogs are on a scent.”\r\n\r\n“Who can be hunting at such a moment as this?” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“And this way, particularly,” continued Porthos, “where they might\r\nexpect the army of the royalists.”\r\n\r\n“The noise comes nearer. Yes, you are right, Porthos, the dogs are on a\r\nscent. But, Yves!” cried Aramis, “come here! come here!”\r\n\r\nYves ran towards him, letting fall the cylinder which he was about to\r\nplace under the boat when the bishop’s call interrupted him.\r\n\r\n“What is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Eh! monseigneur, I cannot understand it,” replied the Breton. “It is\r\nnot at such a moment that the Seigneur de Locmaria would hunt. No, and\r\nyet the dogs--”\r\n\r\n“Unless they have escaped from the kennel.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Goenne, “they are not the Seigneur de Locmaria’s hounds.”\r\n\r\n“In common prudence,” said Aramis, “let us go back into the grotto; the\r\nvoices evidently draw nearer, we shall soon know what we have to trust\r\nto.”\r\n\r\nThey re-entered, but had scarcely proceeded a hundred steps in the\r\ndarkness, when a noise like the hoarse sigh of a creature in distress\r\nresounded through the cavern, and breathless, rapid, terrified, a fox\r\npassed like a flash of lightning before the fugitives, leaped over\r\nthe boat and disappeared, leaving behind its sour scent, which was\r\nperceptible for several seconds under the low vaults of the cave.\r\n\r\n“The fox!” cried the Bretons, with the glad surprise of born hunters.\r\n\r\n“Accursed mischance!” cried the bishop, “our retreat is discovered.”\r\n\r\n“How so?” said Porthos; “are you afraid of a fox?”\r\n\r\n“Eh! my friend, what do you mean by that? why do you specify the fox? It\r\nis not the fox alone. _Pardieu!_ But don’t you know, Porthos, that after\r\nthe foxes come hounds, and after hounds men?”\r\n\r\nPorthos hung his head. As though to confirm the words of Aramis, they\r\nheard the yelping pack approach with frightful swiftness upon the trail.\r\nSix foxhounds burst at once upon the little heath, with mingling yelps\r\nof triumph.\r\n\r\n“There are the dogs, plain enough!” said Aramis, posted on the look-out\r\nbehind a chink in the rocks; “now, who are the huntsmen?”\r\n\r\n“If it is the Seigneur de Locmaria’s,” replied the sailor, “he will\r\nleave the dogs to hunt the grotto, for he knows them, and will not enter\r\nin himself, being quite sure that the fox will come out the other side;\r\nit is there he will wait for him.”\r\n\r\n“It is not the Seigneur de Locmaria who is hunting,” replied Aramis,\r\nturning pale in spite of his efforts to maintain a placid countenance.\r\n\r\n“Who is it, then?” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Look!”\r\n\r\nPorthos applied his eye to the slit, and saw at the summit of a hillock\r\na dozen horsemen urging on their horses in the track of the dogs,\r\nshouting, “_Taiaut! taiaut!_”\r\n\r\n“The guards!” said he.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend, the king’s guards.”\r\n\r\n“The king’s guards! do you say, monseigneur?” cried the Bretons, growing\r\npale in turn.\r\n\r\n“With Biscarrat at their head, mounted upon my gray horse,” continued\r\nAramis.\r\n\r\nThe hounds at the same moment rushed into the grotto like an avalanche,\r\nand the depths of the cavern were filled with their deafening cries.\r\n\r\n“Ah! the devil!” said Aramis, resuming all his coolness at the sight of\r\nthis certain, inevitable danger. “I am perfectly satisfied we are lost,\r\nbut we have, at least, one chance left. If the guards who follow their\r\nhounds happen to discover there is an issue to the grotto, there is no\r\nhelp for us, for on entering they must see both ourselves and our boat.\r\nThe dogs must not go out of the cavern. Their masters must not enter.”\r\n\r\n“That is clear,” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“You understand,” added Aramis, with the rapid precision of command;\r\n“there are six dogs that will be forced to stop at the great stone under\r\nwhich the fox has glided--but at the too narrow opening of which they\r\nmust be themselves stopped and killed.”\r\n\r\nThe Bretons sprang forward, knife in hand. In a few minutes there was a\r\nlamentable concert of angry barks and mortal howls--and then, silence.\r\n\r\n“That’s well!” said Aramis, coolly, “now for the masters!”\r\n\r\n“What is to be done with them?” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Wait their arrival, conceal ourselves, and kill them.”\r\n\r\n“_Kill them!_” replied Porthos.\r\n\r\n“There are sixteen,” said Aramis, “at least, at present.”\r\n\r\n“And well armed,” added Porthos, with a smile of consolation.\r\n\r\n“It will last about ten minutes,” said Aramis. “To work!”\r\n\r\nAnd with a resolute air he took up a musket, and placed a hunting-knife\r\nbetween his teeth.\r\n\r\n“Yves, Goenne, and his son,” continued Aramis, “will pass the muskets to\r\nus. You, Porthos, will fire when they are close. We shall have brought\r\ndown, at the lowest computation, eight, before the others are aware of\r\nanything--that is certain; then all, there are five of us, will dispatch\r\nthe other eight, knife in hand.”\r\n\r\n“And poor Biscarrat?” said Porthos.\r\n\r\nAramis reflected a moment--“Biscarrat first,” replied he, coolly. “He\r\nknows us.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLVIII. The Grotto.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the sort of divination which was the remarkable side of\r\nthe character of Aramis, the event, subject to the risks of things over\r\nwhich uncertainty presides, did not fall out exactly as the bishop of\r\nVannes had foreseen. Biscarrat, better mounted than his companions,\r\narrived first at the opening of the grotto, and comprehended that\r\nfox and hounds were one and all engulfed in it. Only, struck by that\r\nsuperstitious terror which every dark and subterraneous way naturally\r\nimpresses upon the mind of man, he stopped at the outside of the grotto,\r\nand waited till his companions should have assembled round him.\r\n\r\n“Well!” asked the young men, coming up, out of breath, and unable to\r\nunderstand the meaning of this inaction.\r\n\r\n“Well! I cannot hear the dogs; they and the fox must all be lost in this\r\ninfernal cavern.”\r\n\r\n“They were too close up,” said one of the guards, “to have lost scent\r\nall at once. Besides, we should hear them from one side or another. They\r\nmust, as Biscarrat says, be in this grotto.”\r\n\r\n“But then,” said one of the young men, “why don’t they give tongue?”\r\n\r\n“It is strange!” muttered another.\r\n\r\n“Well, but,” said a fourth, “let us go into this grotto. Does it happen\r\nto be forbidden we should enter it?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Biscarrat. “Only, as it looks as dark as a wolf’s mouth,\r\nwe might break our necks in it.”\r\n\r\n“Witness the dogs,” said a guard, “who seem to have broken theirs.”\r\n\r\n“What the devil can have become of them?” asked the young men in chorus.\r\nAnd every master called his dog by his name, whistled to him in his\r\nfavorite mode, without a single one replying to either call or whistle.\r\n\r\n“It is perhaps an enchanted grotto,” said Biscarrat; “let us see.” And,\r\njumping from his horse, he made a step into the grotto.\r\n\r\n“Stop! stop! I will accompany you,” said one of the guards, on seeing\r\nBiscarrat disappear in the shades of the cavern’s mouth.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Biscarrat, “there must be something extraordinary in the\r\nplace--don’t let us risk ourselves all at once. If in ten minutes you do\r\nnot hear of me, you can come in, but not all at once.”\r\n\r\n“Be it so,” said the young man, who, besides, did not imagine that\r\nBiscarrat ran much risk in the enterprise, “we will wait for you.” And\r\nwithout dismounting from their horses, they formed a circle round the\r\ngrotto.\r\n\r\nBiscarrat entered then alone, and advanced through the darkness till\r\nhe came in contact with the muzzle of Porthos’s musket. The resistance\r\nwhich his chest met with astonished him; he naturally raised his hand\r\nand laid hold of the icy barrel. At the same instant, Yves lifted a\r\nknife against the young man, which was about to fall upon him with\r\nall force of a Breton’s arm, when the iron wrist of Porthos stopped it\r\nhalf-way. Then, like low muttering thunder, his voice growled in the\r\ndarkness, “I will not have him killed!”\r\n\r\nBiscarrat found himself between a protection and a threat, the one\r\nalmost as terrible as the other. However brave the young man might\r\nbe, he could not prevent a cry escaping him, which Aramis immediately\r\nsuppressed by placing a handkerchief over his mouth. “Monsieur de\r\nBiscarrat,” said he, in a low voice, “we mean you no harm, and you must\r\nknow that if you have recognized us; but, at the first word, the first\r\ngroan, the first whisper, we shall be forced to kill you as we have\r\nkilled your dogs.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I recognize you, gentlemen,” said the officer, in a low voice.\r\n“But why are you here--what are you doing, here? Unfortunate men! I\r\nthought you were in the fort.”\r\n\r\n“And you, monsieur, you were to obtain conditions for us, I think?”\r\n\r\n“I did all I was able, messieurs, but--”\r\n\r\n“But what?”\r\n\r\n“But there are positive orders.”\r\n\r\n“To kill us?”\r\n\r\nBiscarrat made no reply. It would have cost him too much to speak of the\r\ncord to gentlemen. Aramis understood the silence of the prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Biscarrat,” said he, “you would be already dead if we had not\r\nregard for your youth and our ancient association with your father; but\r\nyou may yet escape from the place by swearing that you will not tell\r\nyour companions what you have seen.”\r\n\r\n“I will not only swear that I will not speak of it,” said Biscarrat,\r\n“but I still further swear that I will do everything in the world to\r\nprevent my companions from setting foot in the grotto.”\r\n\r\n“Biscarrat! Biscarrat!” cried several voices from the outside, coming\r\nlike a whirlwind into the cave.\r\n\r\n“Reply,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Here I am!” cried Biscarrat.\r\n\r\n“Now, begone; we depend on your loyalty.” And he left his hold of the\r\nyoung man, who hastily returned towards the light.\r\n\r\n“Biscarrat! Biscarrat!” cried the voices, still nearer. And the shadows\r\nof several human forms projected into the interior of the grotto.\r\nBiscarrat rushed to meet his friends in order to stop them, and met them\r\njust as they were adventuring into the cave. Aramis and Porthos listened\r\nwith the intense attention of men whose life depends upon a breath of\r\nair.\r\n\r\n“Oh! oh!” exclaimed one of the guards, as he came to the light, “how\r\npale you are!”\r\n\r\n“Pale!” cried another; “you ought to say corpse-color.”\r\n\r\n“I!” said the young man, endeavoring to collect his faculties.\r\n\r\n“In the name of Heaven! what has happened?” exclaimed all the voices.\r\n\r\n“You have not a drop of blood in your veins, my poor friend,” said one\r\nof them, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Messieurs, it is serious,” said another, “he is going to faint; does\r\nany one of you happen to have any salts?” And they all laughed.\r\n\r\nThis hail of jests fell round Biscarrat’s ears like musket-balls in a\r\n_melee_. He recovered himself amidst a deluge of interrogations.\r\n\r\n“What do you suppose I have seen?” asked he. “I was too hot when I\r\nentered the grotto, and I have been struck with a chill. That is all.”\r\n\r\n“But the dogs, the dogs; have you seen them again--did you see anything\r\nof them--do you know anything about them?”\r\n\r\n“I suppose they have got out some other way.”\r\n\r\n“Messieurs,” said one of the young men, “there is in that which is going\r\non, in the paleness and silence of our friend, a mystery which Biscarrat\r\nwill not, or cannot reveal. Only, and this is certain, Biscarrat has\r\nseen something in the grotto. Well, for my part, I am very curious to\r\nsee what it is, even if it is the devil! To the grotto! messieurs, to\r\nthe grotto!”\r\n\r\n“To the grotto!” repeated all the voices. And the echo of the cavern\r\ncarried like a menace to Porthos and Aramis, “To the grotto! to the\r\ngrotto!”\r\n\r\nBiscarrat threw himself before his companions. “Messieurs! messieurs!”\r\n cried he, “in the name of Heaven! do not go in!”\r\n\r\n“Why, what is there so terrific in the cavern?” asked several at once.\r\n“Come, speak, Biscarrat.”\r\n\r\n“Decidedly, it is the devil he has seen,” repeated he who had before\r\nadvanced that hypothesis.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said another, “if he has seen him, he need not be selfish; he\r\nmay as well let us have a look at him in turn.”\r\n\r\n“Messieurs! messieurs! I beseech you,” urged Biscarrat.\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! Let us pass!”\r\n\r\n“Messieurs, I implore you not to enter!”\r\n\r\n“Why, you went in yourself.”\r\n\r\nThen one of the officers, who--of a riper age than the others--had till\r\nthis time remained behind, and had said nothing, advanced. “Messieurs,”\r\n said he, with a calmness which contrasted with the animation of the\r\nyoung men, “there is in there some person, or something, that is not\r\nthe devil; but which, whatever it may be, has had sufficient power to\r\nsilence our dogs. We must discover who this some one is, or what this\r\nsomething is.”\r\n\r\nBiscarrat made a last effort to stop his friends, but it was useless. In\r\nvain he threw himself before the rashest; in vain he clung to the rocks\r\nto bar the passage; the crowd of young men rushed into the cave, in the\r\nsteps of the officer who had spoken last, but who had sprung in first,\r\nsword in hand, to face the unknown danger. Biscarrat, repulsed by\r\nhis friends, unable to accompany them, without passing in the eyes\r\nof Porthos and Aramis for a traitor and a perjurer, with painfully\r\nattentive ear and unconsciously supplicating hands leaned against the\r\nrough side of a rock which he thought must be exposed to the fire of the\r\nmusketeers. As to the guards, they penetrated further and further,\r\nwith exclamations that grew fainter as they advanced. All at once, a\r\ndischarge of musketry, growling like thunder, exploded in the entrails\r\nof the vault. Two or three balls were flattened against the rock on\r\nwhich Biscarrat was leaning. At the same instant, cries, shrieks,\r\nimprecations burst forth, and the little troop of gentlemen\r\nreappeared--some pale, some bleeding--all enveloped in a cloud of\r\nsmoke, which the outer air seemed to suck from the depths of the cavern.\r\n“Biscarrat! Biscarrat!” cried the fugitives, “you knew there was an\r\nambuscade in that cavern, and you did not warn us! Biscarrat, you are\r\nthe cause that four of us are murdered men! Woe be to you, Biscarrat!”\r\n\r\n“You are the cause of my being wounded unto death,” said one of the\r\nyoung men, letting a gush of scarlet life-blood vomit in his palm, and\r\nspattering it into Biscarrat’s livid face. “My blood be on your head!”\r\n And he rolled in agony at the feet of the young man.\r\n\r\n“But, at least, tell us who is there?” cried several furious voices.\r\n\r\nBiscarrat remained silent. “Tell us, or die!” cried the wounded man,\r\nraising himself upon one knee, and lifting towards his companion an\r\narm bearing a useless sword. Biscarrat rushed towards him, opening his\r\nbreast for the blow, but the wounded man fell back not to rise again,\r\nuttering a groan which was his last. Biscarrat, with hair on end,\r\nhaggard eyes, and bewildered head, advanced towards the interior of\r\nthe cavern, saying, “You are right. Death to me, who have allowed my\r\ncomrades to be assassinated. I am a worthless wretch!” And throwing away\r\nhis sword, for he wished to die without defending himself, he rushed\r\nhead foremost into the cavern. The others followed him. The eleven\r\nwho remained out of sixteen imitated his example; but they did not go\r\nfurther than the first. A second discharge laid five upon the icy sand;\r\nand as it was impossible to see whence this murderous thunder issued,\r\nthe others fell back with a terror that can be better imagined than\r\ndescribed. But, far from flying, as the others had done, Biscarrat\r\nremained safe and sound, seated on a fragment of rock, and waited. There\r\nwere only six gentlemen left.\r\n\r\n“Seriously,” said one of the survivors, “is it the devil?”\r\n\r\n“_Ma foi!_ it is much worse,” said another.\r\n\r\n“Ask Biscarrat, he knows.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Biscarrat?” The young men looked round them, and saw that\r\nBiscarrat did not answer.\r\n\r\n“He is dead!” said two or three voices.\r\n\r\n“Oh! no!” replied another, “I saw him through the smoke, sitting quietly\r\non a rock. He is in the cavern; he is waiting for us.”\r\n\r\n“He must know who are there.”\r\n\r\n“And how should he know them?”\r\n\r\n“He was taken prisoner by the rebels.”\r\n\r\n“That is true. Well! let us call him, and learn from him whom we have\r\nto deal with.” And all voices shouted, “Biscarrat! Biscarrat!” But\r\nBiscarrat did not answer.\r\n\r\n“Good!” said the officer who had shown so much coolness in the affair.\r\n“We have no longer any need of him; here are reinforcements coming.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, a company of guards, left in the rear by their officers, whom\r\nthe ardor of the chase had carried away--from seventy-five to eighty\r\nmen--arrived in good order, led by their captain and the first\r\nlieutenant. The five officers hastened to meet their soldiers; and, in\r\nlanguage the eloquence of which may be easily imagined, they related the\r\nadventure, and asked for aid. The captain interrupted them. “Where are\r\nyour companions?” demanded he.\r\n\r\n“Dead!”\r\n\r\n“But there were sixteen of you!”\r\n\r\n“Ten are dead. Biscarrat is in the cavern, and we are five.”\r\n\r\n“Biscarrat is a prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“Probably.”\r\n\r\n“No, for here he is--look.” In fact, Biscarrat appeared at the opening\r\nof the grotto.\r\n\r\n“He is making a sign to come on,” said the officer. “Come on!”\r\n\r\n“Come on!” cried all the troop. And they advanced to meet Biscarrat.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the captain, addressing Biscarrat, “I am assured that\r\nyou know who the men are in that grotto, and who make such a desperate\r\ndefense. In the king’s name I command you to declare what you know.”\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Biscarrat, “you have no need to command me. My word has\r\nbeen restored to me this very instant; and I came in the name of these\r\nmen.”\r\n\r\n“To tell me who they are?”\r\n\r\n“To tell you they are determined to defend themselves to the death,\r\nunless you grant them satisfactory terms.”\r\n\r\n“How many are there of them, then?”\r\n\r\n“There are two,” said Biscarrat.\r\n\r\n“There are two--and want to impose conditions upon us?”\r\n\r\n“There are two, and they have already killed ten of our men.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of people are they--giants?”\r\n\r\n“Worse than that. Do you remember the history of the Bastion\r\nSaint-Gervais, captain?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; where four musketeers held out against an army.”\r\n\r\n“Well, these are two of those same musketeers.”\r\n\r\n“And their names?”\r\n\r\n“At that period they were called Porthos and Aramis. Now they are styled\r\nM. d’Herblay and M. du Vallon.”\r\n\r\n“And what interest have they in all this?”\r\n\r\n“It is they who were holding Bell-Isle for M. Fouquet.”\r\n\r\nA murmur ran through the ranks of the soldiers on hearing the two words\r\n“Porthos and Aramis.” “The musketeers! the musketeers!” repeated they.\r\nAnd among all these brave men, the idea that they were going to have a\r\nstruggle against two of the oldest glories of the French army, made a\r\nshiver, half enthusiasm, two-thirds terror, run through them. In fact,\r\nthose four names--D’Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis--were venerated\r\namong all who wore a sword; as, in antiquity, the names of Hercules,\r\nTheseus, Castor, and Pollux were venerated.\r\n\r\n“Two men--and they have killed ten in two discharges! It is impossible,\r\nMonsieur Biscarrat!”\r\n\r\n“Eh! captain,” replied the latter, “I do not tell you that they have\r\nnot with them two or three men, as the musketeers of the Bastion\r\nSaint-Gervais had two or three lackeys; but, believe me, captain, I\r\nhave seen these men, I have been taken prisoner by them--I know they\r\nthemselves alone are all-sufficient to destroy an army.”\r\n\r\n“That we shall see,” said the captain, “and that in a moment, too.\r\nGentlemen, attention!”\r\n\r\nAt this reply, no one stirred, and all prepared to obey. Biscarrat alone\r\nrisked a last attempt.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he, in a low voice, “be persuaded by me; let us pass\r\non our way. Those two men, those two lions you are going to attack, will\r\ndefend themselves to the death. They have already killed ten of our men;\r\nthey will kill double the number, and end by killing themselves rather\r\nthan surrender. What shall we gain by fighting them?”\r\n\r\n“We shall gain the consciousness, monsieur, of not having allowed eighty\r\nof the king’s guards to retire before two rebels. If I listened to\r\nyour advice, monsieur, I should be a dishonored man; and by dishonoring\r\nmyself I should dishonor the army. Forward, my men!”\r\n\r\nAnd he marched first as far as the opening of the grotto. There he\r\nhalted. The object of this halt was to give Biscarrat and his companions\r\ntime to describe to him the interior of the grotto. Then, when he\r\nbelieved he had a sufficient acquaintance with the place, he divided his\r\ncompany into three bodies, which were to enter successively, keeping up\r\na sustained fire in all directions. No doubt, in this attack they would\r\nlose five more, perhaps ten; but, certainly, they must end by taking the\r\nrebels, since there was no issue; and, at any rate, two men could not\r\nkill eighty.\r\n\r\n“Captain,” said Biscarrat, “I beg to be allowed to march at the head of\r\nthe first platoon.”\r\n\r\n“So be it,” replied the captain; “you have all the honor. I make you a\r\npresent of it.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks!” replied the young man, with all the firmness of his race.\r\n\r\n“Take your sword, then.”\r\n\r\n“I shall go as I am, captain,” said Biscarrat, “for I do not go to kill,\r\nI go to be killed.”\r\n\r\nAnd placing himself at the head of the first platoon, with head\r\nuncovered and arms crossed,--“March, gentlemen,” said he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XLIX. An Homeric Song.\r\n\r\nIt is time to pass to the other camp, and to describe at once the\r\ncombatants and the field of battle. Aramis and Porthos had gone to the\r\ngrotto of Locmaria with the expectation of finding there their canoe\r\nready armed, as well as the three Bretons, their assistants; and they\r\nat first hoped to make the bark pass through the little issue of the\r\ncavern, concealing in that fashion both their labors and their flight.\r\nThe arrival of the fox and dogs obliged them to remain concealed. The\r\ngrotto extended the space of about a hundred _toises_, to that little\r\nslope dominating a creek. Formerly a temple of the Celtic divinities,\r\nwhen Belle-Isle was still called Kalonese, this grotto had beheld more\r\nthan one human sacrifice accomplished in its mystic depths. The first\r\nentrance to the cavern was by a moderate descent, above which distorted\r\nrocks formed a weird arcade; the interior, very uneven and dangerous\r\nfrom the inequalities of the vault, was subdivided into several\r\ncompartments, which communicated with each other by means of rough and\r\njagged steps, fixed right and left, in uncouth natural pillars. At the\r\nthird compartment the vault was so low, the passage so narrow, that the\r\nbark would scarcely have passed without touching the side; nevertheless,\r\nin moments of despair, wood softens and stone grows flexible beneath the\r\nhuman will. Such was the thought of Aramis, when, after having fought\r\nthe fight, he decided upon flight--a flight most dangerous, since all\r\nthe assailants were not dead; and that, admitting the possibility of\r\nputting the bark to sea, they would have to fly in open day, before the\r\nconquered, so interested on recognizing their small number, in pursuing\r\ntheir conquerors. When the two discharges had killed ten men, Aramis,\r\nfamiliar with the windings of the cavern, went to reconnoiter them one\r\nby one, and counted them, for the smoke prevented seeing outside; and\r\nhe immediately commanded that the canoe should be rolled as far as the\r\ngreat stone, the closure of the liberating issue. Porthos collected all\r\nhis strength, took the canoe in his arms, and raised it up, whilst the\r\nBretons made it run rapidly along the rollers. They had descended into\r\nthe third compartment; they had arrived at the stone which walled the\r\noutlet. Porthos seized this gigantic stone at its base, applied his\r\nrobust shoulder, and gave a heave which made the wall crack. A cloud of\r\ndust fell from the vault, with the ashes of ten thousand generations of\r\nsea birds, whose nests stuck like cement to the rock. At the third shock\r\nthe stone gave way, and oscillated for a minute. Porthos, placing his\r\nback against the neighboring rock, made an arch with his foot, which\r\ndrove the block out of the calcareous masses which served for hinges and\r\ncramps. The stone fell, and daylight was visible, brilliant, radiant,\r\nflooding the cavern through the opening, and the blue sea appeared to\r\nthe delighted Bretons. They began to lift the bark over the barricade.\r\nTwenty more _toises_, and it would glide into the ocean. It was during\r\nthis time that the company arrived, was drawn up by the captain, and\r\ndisposed for either an escalade or an assault. Aramis watched\r\nover everything, to favor the labors of his friends. He saw the\r\nreinforcements, counted the men, and convinced himself at a single\r\nglance of the insurmountable peril to which fresh combat would expose\r\nthem. To escape by sea, at the moment the cavern was about to be\r\ninvaded, was impossible. In fact, the daylight which had just been\r\nadmitted to the last compartments had exposed to the soldiers the bark\r\nbeing rolled towards the sea, the two rebels within musket-shot; and\r\none of their discharges would riddle the boat if it did not kill the\r\nnavigators. Besides, allowing everything,--if the bark escaped with the\r\nmen on board of it, how could the alarm be suppressed--how could notice\r\nto the royal lighters be prevented? What could hinder the poor canoe,\r\nfollowed by sea and watched from the shore, from succumbing before the\r\nend of the day? Aramis, digging his hands into his gray hair with rage,\r\ninvoked the assistance of God and the assistance of the demons. Calling\r\nto Porthos, who was doing more work than all the rollers--whether of\r\nflesh or wood--“My friend,” said he, “our adversaries have just received\r\na reinforcement.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, ah!” said Porthos, quietly, “what is to be done, then?”\r\n\r\n“To recommence the combat,” said Aramis, “is hazardous.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Porthos, “for it is difficult to suppose that out of two,\r\none should not be killed; and certainly, if one of us was killed, the\r\nother would get himself killed also.” Porthos spoke these words with\r\nthat heroic nature which, with him, grew grander with necessity.\r\n\r\nAramis felt it like a spur to his heart. “We shall neither of us be\r\nkilled if you do what I tell you, friend Porthos.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me what?”\r\n\r\n“These people are coming down into the grotto.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“We could kill about fifteen of them, but no more.”\r\n\r\n“How many are there in all?” asked Porthos.\r\n\r\n“They have received a reinforcement of seventy-five men.”\r\n\r\n“Seventy-five and five, eighty. Ah!” sighed Porthos.\r\n\r\n“If they fire all at once they will riddle us with balls.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly they will.”\r\n\r\n“Without reckoning,” added Aramis, “that the detonation might occasion a\r\ncollapse of the cavern.”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Porthos, “a piece of falling rock just now grazed my\r\nshoulder.”\r\n\r\n“You see, then?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! it is nothing.”\r\n\r\n“We must determine upon something quickly. Our Bretons are going to\r\ncontinue to roll the canoe towards the sea.”\r\n\r\n“Very well.”\r\n\r\n“We two will keep the powder, the balls, and the muskets here.”\r\n\r\n“But only two, my dear Aramis--we shall never fire three shots\r\ntogether,” said Porthos, innocently, “the defense by musketry is a bad\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“Find a better, then.”\r\n\r\n“I have found one,” said the giant, eagerly; “I will place myself\r\nin ambuscade behind the pillar with this iron bar, and invisible,\r\nunattackable, if they come in floods, I can let my bar fall upon their\r\nskulls, thirty times in a minute. _Hein!_ what do you think of the\r\nproject? You smile!”\r\n\r\n“Excellent, dear friend, perfect! I approve it greatly; only you will\r\nfrighten them, and half of them will remain outside to take us by\r\nfamine. What we want, my good friend, is the entire destruction of the\r\ntroop. A single survivor encompasses our ruin.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, my friend, but how can we attract them, pray?”\r\n\r\n“By not stirring, my good Porthos.”\r\n\r\n“Well! we won’t stir, then; but when they are all together--”\r\n\r\n“Then leave it to me, I have an idea.”\r\n\r\n“If it is so, and your idea proves a good one--and your idea is most\r\nlikely to be good--I am satisfied.”\r\n\r\n“To your ambuscade, Porthos, and count how many enter.”\r\n\r\n“But you, what will you do?”\r\n\r\n“Don’t trouble yourself about me; I have a task to perform.”\r\n\r\n“I think I hear shouts.”\r\n\r\n“It is they! To your post. Keep within reach of my voice and hand.”\r\n\r\nPorthos took refuge in the second compartment, which was in darkness,\r\nabsolutely black. Aramis glided into the third; the giant held in his\r\nhand an iron bar of about fifty pounds weight. Porthos handled this\r\nlever, which had been used in rolling the bark, with marvelous facility.\r\nDuring this time, the Bretons had pushed the bark to the beach. In the\r\nfurther and lighter compartment, Aramis, stooping and concealed, was\r\nbusy with some mysterious maneuver. A command was given in a loud voice.\r\nIt was the last order of the captain commandant. Twenty-five men jumped\r\nfrom the upper rocks into the first compartment of the grotto, and\r\nhaving taken their ground, began to fire. The echoes shrieked and\r\nbarked, the hissing balls seemed actually to rarefy the air, and then\r\nopaque smoke filled the vault.\r\n\r\n“To the left! to the left!” cried Biscarrat, who, in his first assault,\r\nhad seen the passage to the second chamber, and who, animated by the\r\nsmell of powder, wished to guide his soldiers in that direction. The\r\ntroop, accordingly, precipitated themselves to the left--the passage\r\ngradually growing narrower. Biscarrat, with his hands stretched forward,\r\ndevoted to death, marched in advance of the muskets. “Come on! come on!”\r\n exclaimed he, “I see daylight!”\r\n\r\n“Strike, Porthos!” cried the sepulchral voice of Aramis.\r\n\r\nPorthos breathed a heavy sigh--but he obeyed. The iron bar fell full and\r\ndirect upon the head of Biscarrat, who was dead before he had ended his\r\ncry. Then the formidable lever rose ten times in ten seconds, and\r\nmade ten corpses. The soldiers could see nothing; they heard sighs and\r\ngroans; they stumbled over dead bodies, but as they had no conception\r\nof the cause of all this, they came forward jostling each other. The\r\nimplacable bar, still falling, annihilated the first platoon, without\r\na single sound to warn the second, which was quietly advancing; only,\r\ncommanded by the captain, the men had stripped a fir, growing on the\r\nshore, and, with its resinous branches twisted together, the captain had\r\nmade a flambeau. On arriving at the compartment where Porthos, like the\r\nexterminating angel, had destroyed all he touched, the first rank drew\r\nback in terror. No firing had replied to that of the guards, and yet\r\ntheir way was stopped by a heap of dead bodies--they literally walked in\r\nblood. Porthos was still behind his pillar. The captain, illumining with\r\ntrembling pine-torch this frightful carnage, of which he in vain\r\nsought the cause, drew back towards the pillar behind which Porthos was\r\nconcealed. Then a gigantic hand issued from the shade, and fastened\r\non the throat of the captain, who uttered a stifle rattle; his\r\nstretched-out arms beating the air, the torch fell and was extinguished\r\nin blood. A second after, the corpse of the captain dropped close to\r\nthe extinguished torch, and added another body to the heap of dead which\r\nblocked up the passage. All this was effected as mysteriously as though\r\nby magic. At hearing the rattling in the throat of the captain, the\r\nsoldiers who accompanied him had turned round, caught a glimpse of his\r\nextended arms, his eyes starting from their sockets, and then the torch\r\nfell and they were left in darkness. From an unreflective, instinctive,\r\nmechanical feeling, the lieutenant cried:\r\n\r\n“Fire!”\r\n\r\nImmediately a volley of musketry flamed, thundered, roared in the\r\ncavern, bringing down enormous fragments from the vaults. The cavern was\r\nlighted for an instant by this discharge, and then immediately returned\r\nto pitchy darkness rendered thicker by the smoke. To this succeeded a\r\nprofound silence, broken only by the steps of the third brigade, now\r\nentering the cavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter L: The Death of a Titan.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Porthos, more accustomed to the darkness than these\r\nmen, coming from open daylight, was looking round him to see if through\r\nthis artificial midnight Aramis were not making him some signal, he felt\r\nhis arm gently touched, and a voice low as a breath murmured in his ear,\r\n“Come.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Porthos.\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Aramis, if possible, yet more softly.\r\n\r\nAnd amidst the noise of the third brigade, which continued to advance,\r\nthe imprecations of the guards still left alive, the muffled groans of\r\nthe dying, Aramis and Porthos glided unseen along the granite walls of\r\nthe cavern. Aramis led Porthos into the last but one compartment, and\r\nshowed him, in a hollow of the rocky wall, a barrel of powder weighing\r\nfrom seventy to eighty pounds, to which he had just attached a fuse. “My\r\nfriend,” said he to Porthos, “you will take this barrel, the match of\r\nwhich I am going to set fire to, and throw it amidst our enemies; can\r\nyou do so?”\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu!_” replied Porthos; and he lifted the barrel with one hand.\r\n“Light it!”\r\n\r\n“Stop,” said Aramis, “till they are all massed together, and then, my\r\nJupiter, hurl your thunderbolt among them.”\r\n\r\n“Light it,” repeated Porthos.\r\n\r\n“On my part,” continued Aramis, “I will join our Bretons, and help them\r\nto get the canoe to the sea. I will wait for you on the shore; launch it\r\nstrongly, and hasten to us.”\r\n\r\n“Light it,” said Porthos, a third time.\r\n\r\n“But do you understand me?”\r\n\r\n“_Parbleu!_” said Porthos again, with laughter that he did not even\r\nattempt to restrain, “when a thing is explained to me I understand it;\r\nbegone, and give me the light.”\r\n\r\nAramis gave the burning match to Porthos, who held out his arm to him,\r\nhis hands being engaged. Aramis pressed the arm of Porthos with both his\r\nhands, and fell back to the outlet of the cavern where the three rowers\r\nawaited him.\r\n\r\nPorthos, left alone, applied the spark bravely to the match. The\r\nspark--a feeble spark, first principle of conflagration--shone in the\r\ndarkness like a glow-worm, then was deadened against the match which it\r\nset fire to, Porthos enlivening the flame with his breath. The smoke\r\nwas a little dispersed, and by the light of the sparkling match objects\r\nmight, for two seconds, be distinguished. It was a brief but splendid\r\nspectacle, that of this giant, pale, bloody, his countenance lighted by\r\nthe fire of the match burning in surrounding darkness! The soldiers saw\r\nhim, they saw the barrel he held in his hand--they at once understood\r\nwhat was going to happen. Then, these men, already choked with horror at\r\nthe sight of what had been accomplished, filled with terror at thought\r\nof what was about to be accomplished, gave out a simultaneous shriek of\r\nagony. Some endeavored to fly, but they encountered the third brigade,\r\nwhich barred their passage; others mechanically took aim and attempted\r\nto fire their discharged muskets; others fell instinctively upon their\r\nknees. Two or three officers cried out to Porthos to promise him his\r\nliberty if he would spare their lives. The lieutenant of the third\r\nbrigade commanded his men to fire; but the guards had before them their\r\nterrified companions, who served as a living rampart for Porthos. We\r\nhave said that the light produced by the spark and the match did not\r\nlast more than two seconds; but during these two seconds this is what\r\nit illumined: in the first place, the giant, enlarged in the darkness;\r\nthen, at ten paces off, a heap of bleeding bodies, crushed, mutilated,\r\nin the midst of which some still heaved in the last agony, lifting the\r\nmass as a last respiration inflating the sides of some old monster dying\r\nin the night. Every breath of Porthos, thus vivifying the match, sent\r\ntowards this heap of bodies a phosphorescent aura, mingled with streaks\r\nof purple. In addition to this principal group scattered about the\r\ngrotto, as the chances of death or surprise had stretched them, isolated\r\nbodies seemed to be making ghastly exhibitions of their gaping wounds.\r\nAbove ground, bedded in pools of blood, rose, heavy and sparkling, the\r\nshort, thick pillars of the cavern, of which the strongly marked shades\r\nthrew out the luminous particles. And all this was seen by the tremulous\r\nlight of a match attached to a barrel of powder, that is to say, a torch\r\nwhich, whilst throwing a light on the dead past, showed death to come.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, this spectacle did not last above two seconds. During\r\nthis short space of time an officer of the third brigade got together\r\neight men armed with muskets, and, through an opening, ordered them to\r\nfire upon Porthos. But they who received the order to fire trembled so\r\nthat three guards fell by the discharge, and the five remaining balls\r\nhissed on to splinter the vault, plow the ground, or indent the pillars\r\nof the cavern.\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter replied to this volley; then the arm of the giant\r\nswung round; then was seen whirling through the air, like a falling\r\nstar, the train of fire. The barrel, hurled a distance of thirty\r\nfeet, cleared the barricade of dead bodies, and fell amidst a group of\r\nshrieking soldiers, who threw themselves on their faces. The officer had\r\nfollowed the brilliant train in the air; he endeavored to precipitate\r\nhimself upon the barrel and tear out the match before it reached the\r\npowder it contained. Useless! The air had made the flame attached to the\r\nconductor more active; the match, which at rest might have burnt five\r\nminutes, was consumed in thirty seconds, and the infernal work exploded.\r\nFurious vortices of sulphur and nitre, devouring shoals of fire which\r\ncaught every object, the terrible thunder of the explosion, this is what\r\nthe second which followed disclosed in that cavern of horrors. The rocks\r\nsplit like planks of deal beneath the axe. A jet of fire, smoke, and\r\n_debris_ sprang from the middle of the grotto, enlarging as it mounted.\r\nThe large walls of silex tottered and fell upon the sand, and the sand\r\nitself, an instrument of pain when launched from its hard bed, riddled\r\nthe faces with its myriad cutting atoms. Shrieks, imprecations, human\r\nlife, dead bodies--all were engulfed in one terrific crash.\r\n\r\nThe three first compartments became one sepulchral sink into which fell\r\ngrimly back, in the order of their weight, every vegetable, mineral,\r\nor human fragment. Then the lighter sand and ash came down in turn,\r\nstretching like a winding sheet and smoking over the dismal scene. And\r\nnow, in this burning tomb, this subterranean volcano, seek the king’s\r\nguards with their blue coats laced with silver. Seek the officers,\r\nbrilliant in gold, seek for the arms upon which they depended for their\r\ndefense. One single man has made of all of those things a chaos more\r\nconfused, more shapeless, more terrible than the chaos which existed\r\nbefore the creation of the world. There remained nothing of the three\r\ncompartments--nothing by which God could have recognized His handiwork.\r\nAs for Porthos, after having hurled the barrel of powder amidst his\r\nenemies, he had fled, as Aramis had directed him to do, and had gained\r\nthe last compartment, into which air, light, and sunshine penetrated\r\nthrough the opening. Scarcely had he turned the angle which separated\r\nthe third compartment from the fourth when he perceived at a hundred\r\npaces from him the bark dancing on the waves. There were his friends,\r\nthere liberty, there life and victory. Six more of his formidable\r\nstrides, and he would be out of the vault; out of the vault! a dozen of\r\nhis vigorous leaps and he would reach the canoe. Suddenly he felt his\r\nknees give way; his knees seemed powerless, his legs to yield beneath\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Oh! oh!” murmured he, “there is my weakness seizing me again! I can\r\nwalk no further! What is this?”\r\n\r\nAramis perceived him through the opening, and unable to conceive what\r\ncould induce him to stop thus--“Come on, Porthos! come on,” he cried;\r\n“come quickly!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” replied the giant, making an effort that contorted every muscle of\r\nhis body--“oh! but I cannot.” While saying these words, he fell upon\r\nhis knees, but with his mighty hands he clung to the rocks, and raised\r\nhimself up again.\r\n\r\n“Quick! quick!” repeated Aramis, bending forward towards the shore, as\r\nif to draw Porthos towards him with his arms.\r\n\r\n“Here I am,” stammered Porthos, collecting all his strength to make one\r\nstep more.\r\n\r\n“In the name of Heaven! Porthos, make haste! the barrel will blow up!”\r\n\r\n“Make haste, monseigneur!” shouted the Bretons to Porthos, who was\r\nfloundering as in a dream.\r\n\r\nBut there was no time; the explosion thundered, earth gaped, the smoke\r\nwhich hurled through the clefts obscured the sky; the sea flowed back as\r\nthough driven by the blast of flame which darted from the grotto as if\r\nfrom the jaws of some gigantic fiery chimera; the reflux took the\r\nbark out twenty _toises_; the solid rocks cracked to their base, and\r\nseparated like blocks beneath the operation of the wedge; a portion\r\nof the vault was carried up towards heaven, as if it had been built of\r\ncardboard; the green and blue and topaz conflagration and black lava of\r\nliquefactions clashed and combated an instant beneath a majestic dome\r\nof smoke; then oscillated, declined, and fell successively the mighty\r\nmonoliths of rock which the violence of the explosion had not been able\r\nto uproot from the bed of ages; they bowed to each other like grave and\r\nstiff old men, then prostrating themselves, lay down forever in their\r\ndusty tomb.\r\n\r\nThis frightful shock seemed to restore Porthos the strength that he had\r\nlost; he arose, a giant among granite giants. But at the moment he was\r\nflying between the double hedge of granite phantoms, these latter, which\r\nwere no longer supported by the corresponding links, began to roll and\r\ntotter round our Titan, who looked as if precipitated from heaven amidst\r\nrocks which he had just been launching. Porthos felt the very earth\r\nbeneath his feet becoming jelly-tremulous. He stretched both hands to\r\nrepulse the falling rocks. A gigantic block was held back by each of his\r\nextended arms. He bent his head, and a third granite mass sank between\r\nhis shoulders. For an instant the power of Porthos seemed about to fail\r\nhim, but this new Hercules united all his force, and the two walls of\r\nthe prison in which he was buried fell back slowly and gave him place.\r\nFor an instant he appeared, in this frame of granite, like the angel\r\nof chaos, but in pushing back the lateral rocks, he lost his point of\r\nsupport, for the monolith which weighed upon his shoulders, and the\r\nboulder, pressing upon him with all its weight, brought the giant down\r\nupon his knees. The lateral rocks, for an instant pushed back, drew\r\ntogether again, and added their weight to the ponderous mass which would\r\nhave been sufficient to crush ten men. The hero fell without a groan--he\r\nfell while answering Aramis with words of encouragement and hope, for,\r\nthanks to the powerful arch of his hands, for an instant he believed\r\nthat, like Enceladus, he would succeed in shaking off the triple load.\r\nBut by degrees Aramis beheld the block sink; the hands, strung for an\r\ninstant, the arms stiffened for a last effort, gave way, the extended\r\nshoulders sank, wounded and torn, and the rocks continued to gradually\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\n“Porthos! Porthos!” cried Aramis, tearing his hair. “Porthos! where are\r\nyou? Speak!”\r\n\r\n“Here, here,” murmured Porthos, with a voice growing evidently weaker,\r\n“patience! patience!”\r\n\r\nScarcely had he pronounced these words, when the impulse of the fall\r\naugmented the weight; the enormous rock sank down, pressed by those\r\nothers which sank in from the sides, and, as it were, swallowed up\r\nPorthos in a sepulcher of badly jointed stones. On hearing the dying\r\nvoice of his friend, Aramis had sprung to land. Two of the Bretons\r\nfollowed him, with each a lever in his hand--one being sufficient to\r\ntake care of the bark. The dying rattle of the valiant gladiator guided\r\nthem amidst the ruins. Aramis, animated, active and young as at twenty,\r\nsprang towards the triple mass, and with his hands, delicate as those of\r\na woman, raised by a miracle of strength the corner-stone of this great\r\ngranite grave. Then he caught a glimpse, through the darkness of that\r\ncharnel-house, of the still brilliant eye of his friend, to whom the\r\nmomentary lifting of the mass restored a momentary respiration. The\r\ntwo men came rushing up, grasped their iron levers, united their triple\r\nstrength, not merely to raise it, but sustain it. All was useless. They\r\ngave way with cries of grief, and the rough voice of Porthos, seeing\r\nthem exhaust themselves in a useless struggle, murmured in an almost\r\ncheerful tone those supreme words which came to his lips with the last\r\nrespiration, “Too heavy!”\r\n\r\nAfter which his eyes darkened and closed, his face grew ashy pale, the\r\nhands whitened, and the colossus sank quite down, breathing his last\r\nsigh. With him sank the rock, which, even in his dying agony he had\r\nstill held up. The three men dropped the levers, which rolled upon the\r\ntumulary stone. Then, breathless, pale, his brow covered with sweat,\r\nAramis listened, his breast oppressed, his heart ready to break.\r\n\r\nNothing more. The giant slept the eternal sleep, in the sepulcher which\r\nGod had built about him to his measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LI. Porthos’s Epitaph.\r\n\r\nAramis, silent and sad as ice, trembling like a timid child, arose\r\nshivering from the stone. A Christian does not walk on tombs. But,\r\nthough capable of standing, he was not capable of walking. It might\r\nbe said that something of dead Porthos had just died within him. His\r\nBretons surrounded him; Aramis yielded to their kind exertions, and the\r\nthree sailors, lifting him up, carried him to the canoe. Then, having\r\nlaid him down upon the bench near the rudder, they took to their oars,\r\npreferring this to hoisting sail, which might betray them.\r\n\r\nOn all that leveled surface of the ancient grotto of Locmaria, one\r\nsingle hillock attracted their eyes. Aramis never removed his from it;\r\nand, at a distance out in the sea, in proportion as the shore receded,\r\nthat menacing proud mass of rock seemed to draw itself up, as formerly\r\nPorthos used to draw himself up, raising a smiling, yet invincible head\r\ntowards heaven, like that of his dear old honest valiant friend, the\r\nstrongest of the four, yet the first dead. Strange destiny of these men\r\nof brass! The most simple of heart allied to the most crafty; strength\r\nof body guided by subtlety of mind; and in the decisive moment, when\r\nvigor alone could save mind and body, a stone, a rock, a vile material\r\nweight, triumphed over manly strength, and falling upon the body, drove\r\nout the mind.\r\n\r\nWorthy Porthos! born to help other men, always ready to sacrifice\r\nhimself for the safety of the weak, as if God had only given him\r\nstrength for that purpose; when dying he only thought he was carrying\r\nout the conditions of his compact with Aramis, a compact, however, which\r\nAramis alone had drawn up, and which Porthos had only known to suffer\r\nby its terrible solidarity. Noble Porthos! of what good now are thy\r\nchateaux overflowing with sumptuous furniture, forests overflowing with\r\ngame, lakes overflowing with fish, cellars overflowing with wealth! Of\r\nwhat service to thee now thy lackeys in brilliant liveries, and in the\r\nmidst of them Mousqueton, proud of the power delegated by thee! Oh,\r\nnoble Porthos! careful heaper-up of treasure, was it worth while to\r\nlabor to sweeten and gild life, to come upon a desert shore, surrounded\r\nby the cries of seagulls, and lay thyself, with broken bones, beneath\r\na torpid stone? Was it worth while, in short, noble Porthos, to heap so\r\nmuch gold, and not have even the distich of a poor poet engraven upon\r\nthy monument? Valiant Porthos! he still, without doubt, sleeps, lost,\r\nforgotten, beneath the rock the shepherds of the heath take for the\r\ngigantic abode of a _dolmen_. And so many twining branches, so many\r\nmosses, bent by the bitter wind of ocean, so many lichens solder thy\r\nsepulcher to earth, that no passers-by will imagine such a block of\r\ngranite could ever have been supported by the shoulders of one man.\r\n\r\nAramis, still pale, still icy-cold, his heart upon his lips, looked,\r\neven till, with the last ray of daylight, the shore faded on the\r\nhorizon. Not a word escaped him, not a sigh rose from his deep breast.\r\nThe superstitious Bretons looked upon him, trembling. Such silence was\r\nnot that of a man, it was the silence of a statue. In the meantime, with\r\nthe first gray lines that lighted up the heavens, the canoe hoisted its\r\nlittle sail, which, swelling with the kisses of the breeze, and carrying\r\nthem rapidly from the coast, made bravest way towards Spain, across the\r\ndreaded Gulf of Gascony, so rife with storms. But scarcely half an hour\r\nafter the sail had been hoisted, the rowers became inactive, reclining\r\non their benches, and, making an eye-shade with their hands, pointed out\r\nto each other a white spot which appeared on the horizon as motionless\r\nas a gull rocked by the viewless respiration of the waves. But that\r\nwhich might have appeared motionless to ordinary eyes was moving at a\r\nquick rate to the experienced eye of the sailor; that which appeared\r\nstationary upon the ocean was cutting a rapid way through it. For some\r\ntime, seeing the profound torpor in which their master was plunged,\r\nthey did not dare to rouse him, and satisfied themselves with exchanging\r\ntheir conjectures in whispers. Aramis, in fact, so vigilant, so\r\nactive--Aramis, whose eye, like that of the lynx, watched without\r\nceasing, and saw better by night than by day--Aramis seemed to sleep\r\nin this despair of soul. An hour passed thus, during which daylight\r\ngradually disappeared, but during which also the sail in view gained so\r\nswiftly on the bark, that Goenne, one of the three sailors, ventured to\r\nsay aloud:\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, we are being chased!”\r\n\r\nAramis made no reply; the ship still gained upon them. Then, of their\r\nown accord, two of the sailors, by the direction of the patron Yves,\r\nlowered the sail, in order that that single point upon the surface of\r\nthe waters should cease to be a guide to the eye of the enemy pursuing\r\nthem. On the part of the ship in sight, on the contrary, two more small\r\nsails were run up at the extremities of the masts. Unfortunately, it was\r\nthe time of the finest and longest days of the year, and the moon, in\r\nall her brilliancy, succeeded inauspicious daylight. The _balancelle_,\r\nwhich was pursuing the little bark before the wind, had then still half\r\nan hour of twilight, and a whole night almost as light as day.\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur! monseigneur! we are lost!” said the captain. “Look! they\r\nsee us plainly, though we have lowered sail.”\r\n\r\n“That is not to be wondered at,” murmured one of the sailors, “since\r\nthey say that, by the aid of the devil, the Paris-folk have fabricated\r\ninstruments with which they see as well at a distance as near, by night\r\nas well as by day.”\r\n\r\nAramis took a telescope from the bottom of the boat, focussed it\r\nsilently, and passing it to the sailor, “Here,” said he, “look!” The\r\nsailor hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be alarmed,” said the bishop, “there is no sin in it; and if\r\nthere is any sin, I will take it on myself.”\r\n\r\nThe sailor lifted the glass to his eye, and uttered a cry. He believed\r\nthat the vessel, which appeared to be distant about cannon-shot, had\r\nat a single bound cleared the whole distance. But, on withdrawing\r\nthe instrument from his eye, he saw that, except the way which the\r\n_balancelle_ had been able to make during that brief instant, it was\r\nstill at the same distance.\r\n\r\n“So,” murmured the sailor, “they can see us as we see them.”\r\n\r\n“They see us,” said Aramis, and sank again into impassibility.\r\n\r\n“What!--they see us!” said Yves. “Impossible!”\r\n\r\n“Well, captain, look yourself,” said the sailor. And he passed him the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this?”\r\n asked Yves.\r\n\r\nAramis shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe skipper lifted the glass to his eye. “Oh! monseigneur,” said he, “it\r\nis a miracle--there they are; it seems as if I were going to touch them.\r\nTwenty-five men at least! Ah! I see the captain forward. He holds a\r\nglass like this, and is looking at us. Ah! he turns round, and gives\r\nan order; they are rolling a piece of cannon forward--they are loading\r\nit--pointing it. _Misericorde!_ they are firing at us!”\r\n\r\nAnd by a mechanical movement, the skipper put aside the telescope, and\r\nthe pursuing ship, relegated to the horizon, appeared again in its true\r\naspect. The vessel was still at the distance of nearly a league, but the\r\nmaneuver sighted thus was not less real. A light cloud of smoke appeared\r\nbeneath the sails, more blue than they, and spreading like a flower\r\nopening; then, at about a mile from the little canoe, they saw the ball\r\ntake the crown off two or three waves, dig a white furrow in the sea,\r\nand disappear at the end of it, as inoffensive as the stone with which,\r\nin play, a boy makes ducks and drakes. It was at once a menace and a\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\n“What is to be done?” asked the patron.\r\n\r\n“They will sink us!” said Goenne, “give us absolution, monseigneur!” And\r\nthe sailors fell on their knees before him.\r\n\r\n“You forget that they can see you,” said he.\r\n\r\n“That is true!” said the sailors, ashamed of their weakness. “Give us\r\nyour orders, monseigneur, we are prepared to die for you.”\r\n\r\n“Let us wait,” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“How--let us wait?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; do you not see, as you just now said, that if we endeavor to fly,\r\nthey will sink us?”\r\n\r\n“But, perhaps,” the patron ventured to say, “perhaps under cover of\r\nnight, we could escape them.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Aramis, “they have, no doubt, Greek fire with which to\r\nlighten their own course and ours likewise.”\r\n\r\nAt the same moment, as if the vessel was responsive to the appeal of\r\nAramis, a second cloud of smoke mounted slowly to the heavens, and from\r\nthe bosom of that cloud sparkled an arrow of flame, which described a\r\nparabola like a rainbow, and fell into the sea, where it continued to\r\nburn, illuminating a space of a quarter of a league in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe Bretons looked at each other in terror. “You see plainly,” said\r\nAramis, “it will be better to wait for them.”\r\n\r\nThe oars dropped from the hands of the sailors, and the bark, ceasing\r\nto make way, rocked motionless upon the summits of the waves. Night came\r\non, but still the ship drew nearer. It might be imagined it redoubled\r\nits speed with darkness. From time to time, as a vulture rears its head\r\nout of its nest, the formidable Greek fire darted from its sides, and\r\ncast its flame upon the ocean like an incandescent snowfall. At last\r\nit came within musket-shot. All the men were on deck, arms in hand; the\r\ncannoniers were at their guns, the matches burning. It might be thought\r\nthey were about to board a frigate and to fight a crew superior in\r\nnumber to their own, not to attempt the capture of a canoe manned by\r\nfour people.\r\n\r\n“Surrender!” cried the commander of the _balancelle_, with the aid of\r\nhis speaking-trumpet.\r\n\r\nThe sailors looked at Aramis. Aramis made a sign with his head. Yves\r\nwaved a white cloth at the end of a gaff. This was like striking their\r\nflag. The pursuer came on like a race-horse. It launched a fresh Greek\r\nfire, which fell within twenty paces of the little canoe, and threw a\r\nlight upon them as white as sunshine.\r\n\r\n“At the first sign of resistance,” cried the commander of the\r\n_balancelle_, “fire!” The soldiers brought their muskets to the present.\r\n\r\n“Did we not say we surrendered?” said Yves.\r\n\r\n“Alive, alive, captain!” cried one excited soldier, “they must be taken\r\nalive.”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes--living,” said the captain. Then turning towards the Bretons,\r\n“Your lives are safe, my friends!” cried he, “all but the Chevalier\r\nd’Herblay.”\r\n\r\nAramis stared imperceptibly. For an instant his eye was fixed upon the\r\ndepths of the ocean, illumined by the last flashes of the Greek fire,\r\nwhich ran along the sides of the waves, played on the crests like\r\nplumes, and rendered still darker and more terrible the gulfs they\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear, monseigneur?” said the sailors.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What are your orders?”\r\n\r\n“Accept!”\r\n\r\n“But you, monseigneur?”\r\n\r\nAramis leaned still more forward, and dipped the ends of his long white\r\nfingers in the green limpid waters of the sea, to which he turned with\r\nsmiles as to a friend.\r\n\r\n“Accept!” repeated he.\r\n\r\n“We accept,” repeated the sailors; “but what security have we?”\r\n\r\n“The word of a gentleman,” said the officer. “By my rank and by my name\r\nI swear that all except M. le Chevalier d’Herblay shall have their lives\r\nspared. I am lieutenant of the king’s frigate the ‘Pomona,’ and my name\r\nis Louis Constant de Pressigny.”\r\n\r\nWith a rapid gesture, Aramis--already bent over the side of the bark\r\ntowards the sea--drew himself up, and with a flashing eye, and a smile\r\nupon his lips, “Throw out the ladder, messieurs,” said he, as if the\r\ncommand had belonged to him. He was obeyed. When Aramis, seizing the\r\nrope ladder, walked straight up to the commander, with a firm step,\r\nlooked at him earnestly, made a sign to him with his hand, a mysterious\r\nand unknown sign at sight of which the officer turned pale, trembled,\r\nand bowed his head, the sailors were profoundly astonished. Without a\r\nword Aramis then raised his hand to the eyes of the commander and showed\r\nhim the collet of a ring he wore on the ring-finger of his left hand.\r\nAnd while making this sign Aramis, draped in cold and haughty majesty,\r\nhad the air of an emperor giving his hand to be kissed. The commandant,\r\nwho for a moment had raised his head, bowed a second time with marks of\r\nthe most profound respect. Then stretching his hand out, in his turn,\r\ntowards the poop, that is to say, towards his own cabin, he drew back to\r\nallow Aramis to go first. The three Bretons, who had come on board after\r\ntheir bishop, looked at each other, stupefied. The crew were awed to\r\nsilence. Five minutes after, the commander called the second lieutenant,\r\nwho returned immediately, ordering the head to be put towards Corunna.\r\nWhilst this order was being executed, Aramis reappeared upon the deck,\r\nand took a seat near the _bastingage_. Night had fallen; the moon had\r\nnot yet risen, yet Aramis looked incessantly towards Belle-Isle. Yves\r\nthen approached the captain, who had returned to take his post in the\r\nstern, and said, in a low and humble voice, “What course are we to\r\nfollow, captain?”\r\n\r\n“We take what course monseigneur pleases,” replied the officer.\r\n\r\nAramis passed the night leaning upon the _bastingage_. Yves, on\r\napproaching him next morning, remarked that “the night must have been\r\na very damp one, for the wood on which the bishop’s head had rested was\r\nsoaked with dew.” Who knows?--that dew was, it may be, the first tears\r\nthat had ever fallen from the eyes of Aramis!\r\n\r\nWhat epitaph would have been worth that, good Porthos?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LII. M. de Gesvres’s Round.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan was little used to resistance like that he had just\r\nexperienced. He returned, profoundly irritated, to Nantes. Irritation,\r\nwith this vigorous man, usually vented itself in impetuous attack, which\r\nfew people, hitherto, were they king, were they giants, had been able to\r\nresist. Trembling with rage, he went straight to the castle, and asked\r\nan audience with the king. It might be about seven o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and, since his arrival at Nantes, the king had been an early\r\nriser. But on arriving at the corridor with which we are acquainted,\r\nD’Artagnan found M. de Gesvres, who stopped him politely, telling him\r\nnot to speak too loud and disturb the king. “Is the king asleep?” said\r\nD’Artagnan. “Well, I will let him sleep. But about what o’clock do you\r\nsuppose he will rise?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! in about two hours; his majesty has been up all night.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan took his hat again, bowed to M. de Gesvres, and returned to\r\nhis own apartments. He came back at half-past nine, and was told that\r\nthe king was at breakfast. “That will just suit me,” said D’Artagnan. “I\r\nwill talk to the king while he is eating.”\r\n\r\nM. de Brienne reminded D’Artagnan that the king would not see any one at\r\nmeal-time.\r\n\r\n“But,” said D’Artagnan, looking askant at Brienne, “you do not know,\r\nperhaps, monsieur, that I have the privilege of _entree_ anywhere--and\r\nat any hour.”\r\n\r\nBrienne took the captain’s hand kindly, and said, “Not at Nantes, dear\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan. The king, in this journey, has changed everything.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, a little softened, asked about what o’clock the king would\r\nhave finished his breakfast.\r\n\r\n“We don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“Eh?--don’t know! What does that mean? You don’t know how much time the\r\nking devotes to eating? It is generally an hour; and, if we admit that\r\nthe air of the Loire gives an additional appetite, we will extend it to\r\nan hour and a half; that is enough, I think. I will wait where I am.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, the order of the day is not to allow any\r\nperson to remain in this corridor; I am on guard for that particular\r\npurpose.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan felt his anger mounting to his brain a second time. He\r\nwent out quickly, for fear of complicating the affair by a display of\r\npremature ill-humor. As soon as he was out he began to reflect. “The\r\nking,” said he, “will not receive me, that is evident. The young man is\r\nangry; he is afraid, beforehand, of the words that I may speak to him.\r\nYes; but in the meantime Belle-Isle is besieged, and my two friends by\r\nnow probably taken or killed. Poor Porthos! As to Master Aramis, he is\r\nalways full of resources, and I am easy on his account. But, no, no;\r\nPorthos is not yet an invalid, nor is Aramis in his dotage. The one\r\nwith his arm, the other with his imagination, will find work for his\r\nmajesty’s soldiers. Who knows if these brave men may not get up for\r\nthe edification of his most Christian majesty a little bastion of\r\nSaint-Gervais! I don’t despair of it. They have cannon and a garrison.\r\nAnd yet,” continued D’Artagnan, “I don’t know whether it would not\r\nbe better to stop the combat. For myself alone I will not put up with\r\neither surly looks or insults from the king; but for my friends I must\r\nput up with everything. Shall I go to M. Colbert? Now, there is a man\r\nI must acquire the habit of terrifying. I will go to M. Colbert.” And\r\nD’Artagnan set forward bravely to find M. Colbert, but was informed that\r\nhe was working with the king, at the castle of Nantes. “Good!” cried he,\r\n“the times have come again in which I measured my steps from De Treville\r\nto the cardinal, from the cardinal to the queen, from the queen to\r\nLouis XIII. Truly is it said that men, in growing old, become children\r\nagain!--To the castle, then!” He returned thither. M. de Lyonne was\r\ncoming out. He gave D’Artagnan both hands, but told him that the king\r\nhad been busy all the preceding evening and all night, and that orders\r\nhad been given that no one should be admitted. “Not even the captain who\r\ntakes the order?” cried D’Artagnan. “I think that is rather too strong.”\r\n\r\n“Not even he,” said M. de Lyonne.\r\n\r\n“Since that is the case,” replied D’Artagnan, wounded to the heart;\r\n“since the captain of the musketeers, who has always entered the\r\nking’s chamber, is no longer allowed to enter it, his cabinet, or\r\nhis _salle-a-manger_, either the king is dead, or his captain is in\r\ndisgrace. Do me the favor, then, M. de Lyonne, who are in favor, to\r\nreturn and tell the king, plainly, I send him my resignation.”\r\n\r\n“D’Artagnan, beware of what you are doing!”\r\n\r\n“For friendship’s sake, go!” and he pushed him gently towards the\r\ncabinet.\r\n\r\n“Well, I will go,” said Lyonne.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan waited, walking about the corridor in no enviable mood.\r\nLyonne returned.\r\n\r\n“Well, what did the king say?” exclaimed D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“He simply answered, ‘’Tis well,’” replied Lyonne.\r\n\r\n“That it was well!” said the captain, with an explosion. “That is to\r\nsay, that he accepts it? Good! Now, then, I am free! I am only a plain\r\ncitizen, M. de Lyonne. I have the pleasure of bidding you good-bye!\r\nFarewell, castle, corridor, ante-chamber! a _bourgeois_, about to\r\nbreathe at liberty, takes his farewell of you.”\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting longer, the captain sprang from the terrace down the\r\nstaircase, where he had picked up the fragments of Gourville’s letter.\r\nFive minutes after, he was at the hostelry, where, according to the\r\ncustom of all great officers who have lodgings at the castle, he had\r\ntaken what was called his city-chamber. But when he arrived there,\r\ninstead of throwing off his sword and cloak, he took his pistols, put\r\nhis money into a large leather purse, sent for his horses from the\r\ncastle-stables, and gave orders that would ensure their reaching Vannes\r\nduring the night. Everything went on according to his wishes. At eight\r\no’clock in the evening, he was putting his foot in the stirrup, when\r\nM. de Gesvres appeared, at the head of twelve guards, in front of the\r\nhostelry. D’Artagnan saw all from the corner of his eye; he could not\r\nfail seeing thirteen men and thirteen horses. But he feigned not to\r\nobserve anything, and was about to put his horse in motion. Gesvres rode\r\nup to him. “Monsieur d’Artagnan!” said he, aloud.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Monsieur de Gesvres! good evening!”\r\n\r\n“One would say you were getting on horseback.”\r\n\r\n“More than that,--I am mounted,--as you see.”\r\n\r\n“It is fortunate I have met with you.”\r\n\r\n“Were you looking for me, then?”\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu!_ yes.”\r\n\r\n“On the part of the king, I will wager?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“As I, three days ago, went in search of M. Fouquet?”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! It is of no use being over-delicate with me; that is all\r\nlabor lost. Tell me at once you are come to arrest me.”\r\n\r\n“To arrest you?--Good heavens! no.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you come to accost me with twelve horsemen at your heels, then?”\r\n\r\n“I am making my round.”\r\n\r\n“That isn’t bad! And so you pick me up in your round, eh?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t pick you up; I meet with you, and I beg you to come with me.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“To the king.”\r\n\r\n“Good!” said D’Artagnan, with a bantering air; “the king is disengaged.”\r\n\r\n“For Heaven’s sake, captain,” said M. de Gesvres, in a low voice to the\r\nmusketeer, “do not compromise yourself! these men hear you.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan laughed aloud, and replied:\r\n\r\n“March! People who are arrested are placed between the six first guards\r\nand the six last.”\r\n\r\n“But as I am not arresting you,” said M. de Gesvres, “you will march\r\nbehind, with me, if you please.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said D’Artagnan, “that is very polite, duke, and you are\r\nright in being so; for if ever I had had to make my rounds near your\r\n_chambre-de-ville_, I should have been courteous to you, I assure you,\r\non the word of a gentleman! Now, one favor more; what does the king want\r\nwith me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the king is furious!”\r\n\r\n“Very well! the king, who has thought it worth while to be angry, may\r\ntake the trouble to grow calm again; that is all. I shan’t die of that,\r\nI will swear.”\r\n\r\n“No, but--”\r\n\r\n“But--I shall be sent to keep company with unfortunate M. Fouquet.\r\n_Mordioux!_ That is a gallant man, a worthy man! We shall live very\r\nsociably together, I will be sworn.”\r\n\r\n“Here we are at our place of destination,” said the duke. “Captain, for\r\nHeaven’s sake be calm with the king!”\r\n\r\n“Ah! ah! you are playing the brave man with me, duke!” said D’Artagnan,\r\nthrowing one of his defiant glances over Gesvres. “I have been told\r\nthat you are ambitious of uniting your guards with my musketeers. This\r\nstrikes me as a splendid opportunity.”\r\n\r\n“I will take exceeding good care not to avail myself of it, captain.”\r\n\r\n“And why not, pray?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, for many reasons--in the first place, for this: if I were to\r\nsucceed you in the musketeers after having arrested you--”\r\n\r\n“Ah! then you admit you have arrested me?”\r\n\r\n“No, I _don’t_.”\r\n\r\n“Say met me, then. So, you were saying _if_ you were to succeed me after\r\nhaving arrested me?”\r\n\r\n“Your musketeers, at the first exercise with ball cartridges, would fire\r\n_my_ way, by mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, as to that I won’t say; for the fellows _do_ love me a little.”\r\n\r\nGesvres made D’Artagnan pass in first, and took him straight to the\r\ncabinet where Louis was waiting for his captain of the musketeers, and\r\nplaced himself behind his colleague in the ante-chamber. The king could\r\nbe heard distinctly, speaking aloud to Colbert in the same cabinet where\r\nColbert might have heard, a few days before, the king speaking aloud\r\nwith M. d’Artagnan. The guards remained as a mounted picket before the\r\nprincipal gate; and the report was quickly spread throughout the city\r\nthat monsieur le capitaine of the musketeers had been arrested by order\r\nof the king. Then these men were seen to be in motion, and as in the\r\ngood old times of Louis XIII. and M. de Treville, groups were formed,\r\nand staircases were filled; vague murmurs, issuing from the court below,\r\ncame rolling to the upper stories, like the distant moaning of the\r\nwaves. M. de Gesvres became uneasy. He looked at his guards, who, after\r\nbeing interrogated by the musketeers who had just got among their ranks,\r\nbegan to shun them with a manifestation of innocence. D’Artagnan was\r\ncertainly less disturbed by all this than M. de Gesvres, the captain of\r\nthe guards. As soon as he entered, he seated himself on the ledge of a\r\nwindow whence with his eagle glance he saw all that was going on without\r\nthe least emotion. No step of the progressive fermentation which had\r\nshown itself at the report of his arrest escaped him. He foresaw\r\nthe very moment the explosion would take place; and we know that his\r\nprevisions were in general correct.\r\n\r\n“It would be very whimsical,” thought he, “if, this evening, my\r\npraetorians should make me king of France. How I should laugh!”\r\n\r\nBut, at the height, all was stopped. Guards, musketeers, officers,\r\nsoldiers, murmurs, uneasiness, dispersed, vanished, died away; there was\r\nan end of menace and sedition. One word had calmed the waves. The king\r\nhad desired Brienne to say, “Hush, messieurs! you disturb the king.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan sighed. “All is over!” said he; “the musketeers of the\r\npresent day are not those of his majesty Louis XIII. All is over!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan, you are wanted in the ante-chamber of the king,”\r\n proclaimed an usher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIII. King Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThe king was seated in his cabinet, with his back turned towards the\r\ndoor of entrance. In front of him was a mirror, in which, while turning\r\nover his papers, he could see at a glance those who came in. He did\r\nnot take any notice of the entrance of D’Artagnan, but spread above his\r\nletters and plans the large silk cloth he used to conceal his secrets\r\nfrom the importunate. D’Artagnan understood this by-play, and kept\r\nin the background; so that at the end of a minute the king, who heard\r\nnothing, and saw nothing save from the corner of his eye, was obliged to\r\ncry, “Is not M. d’Artagnan there?”\r\n\r\n“I am here, sire,” replied the musketeer, advancing.\r\n\r\n“Well, monsieur,” said the king, fixing his pellucid eyes on D’Artagnan,\r\n“what have you to say to me?”\r\n\r\n“I, sire!” replied the latter, who watched the first blow of his\r\nadversary to make a good retort; “I have nothing to say to your majesty,\r\nunless it be that you have caused me to be arrested, and here I am.”\r\n\r\nThe king was going to reply that he had not had D’Artagnan arrested, but\r\nany such sentence appeared too much like an excuse, and he was silent.\r\nD’Artagnan likewise preserved an obstinate silence.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” at length resumed the king, “what did I charge you to go and\r\ndo at Belle-Isle? Tell me, if you please.”\r\n\r\nThe king while uttering these words looked intently at his captain.\r\nHere D’Artagnan was fortunate; the king seemed to place the game in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” replied he, “that your majesty does me the honor to ask\r\nwhat I went to Belle-Isle to accomplish?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Well! sire, I know nothing about it; it is not of me that question\r\nshould be asked, but of that infinite number of officers of all kinds,\r\nto whom have been given innumerable orders of all kinds, whilst to me,\r\nhead of the expedition, nothing precise was said or stated in any form\r\nwhatever.”\r\n\r\nThe king was hurt: he showed it by his reply. “Monsieur,” said he,\r\n“orders have only been given to such as were judged faithful.”\r\n\r\n“And, therefore, I have been astonished, sire,” retorted the musketeer,\r\n“that a captain like myself, who ranks with a marechal of France,\r\nshould have found himself under the orders of five or six lieutenants or\r\nmajors, good to make spies of, possibly, but not at all fit to conduct\r\na warlike expedition. It was upon this subject I came to demand an\r\nexplanation of your majesty, when I found the door closed against me,\r\nwhich, the final insult offered to a brave man, has led me to quit your\r\nmajesty’s service.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied the king, “you still believe that you are living in\r\nan age when kings were, as you complain of having been, under the orders\r\nand at the discretion of their inferiors. You seem to forget that a king\r\nowes an account of his actions to none but God.”\r\n\r\n“I forget nothing, sire,” said the musketeer, wounded by this lesson.\r\n“Besides, I do not see in what an honest man, when he asks of his king\r\nhow he has ill-served him, offends him.”\r\n\r\n“You have ill-served me, monsieur, by siding with my enemies against\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Who are your enemies, sire?”\r\n\r\n“The men I sent you to fight.”\r\n\r\n“Two men the enemies of the whole of your majesty’s army! That is\r\nincredible.”\r\n\r\n“You have no power to judge of my will.”\r\n\r\n“But I have to judge of my own friendships, sire.”\r\n\r\n“He who serves his friends does not serve his master.”\r\n\r\n“I so well understand this, sire, that I have respectfully offered your\r\nmajesty my resignation.”\r\n\r\n“And I have accepted it, monsieur,” said the king. “Before being\r\nseparated from you I was willing to prove to you that I know how to keep\r\nmy word.”\r\n\r\n“Your majesty has kept more than your word, for your majesty has had me\r\narrested,” said D’Artagnan, with his cold, bantering air; “you did not\r\npromise me that, sire.”\r\n\r\nThe king would not condescend to perceive the pleasantry, and continued,\r\nseriously, “You see, monsieur, to what grave steps your disobedience\r\nforces me.”\r\n\r\n“My disobedience!” cried D’Artagnan, red with anger.\r\n\r\n“It is the mildest term that I can find,” pursued the king. “My idea was\r\nto take and punish rebels; was I bound to inquire whether these rebels\r\nwere your friends or not?”\r\n\r\n“But I was,” replied D’Artagnan. “It was a cruelty on your majesty’s\r\npart to send me to capture my friends and lead them to your gibbets.”\r\n\r\n“It was a trial I had to make, monsieur, of pretended servants, who eat\r\nmy bread and _should_ defend my person. The trial has succeeded ill,\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan.”\r\n\r\n“For one bad servant your majesty loses,” said the musketeer, with\r\nbitterness, “there are ten who, on that same day, go through a like\r\nordeal. Listen to me, sire; I am not accustomed to that service. Mine\r\nis a rebel sword when I am required to do ill. It was ill to send me\r\nin pursuit of two men whose lives M. Fouquet, your majesty’s preserver,\r\nimplored you to save. Still further, these men were my friends. They did\r\nnot attack your majesty, they succumbed to your blind anger. Besides,\r\nwhy were they not allowed to escape? What crime had they committed? I\r\nadmit you may contest with me the right of judging their conduct.\r\nBut why suspect me before the action? Why surround me with spies? Why\r\ndisgrace me before the army? Why me, in whom till now you showed the\r\nmost entire confidence--who for thirty years have been attached to your\r\nperson, and have given you a thousand proofs of my devotion--for it must\r\nbe said, now that I am accused--why reduce me to see three thousand of\r\nthe king’s soldiers march in battle against two men?”\r\n\r\n“One would say you have forgotten what these men have done to me!” said\r\nthe king, in a hollow voice, “and that it was no merit of theirs I was\r\nnot lost.”\r\n\r\n“Sire, one would imagine you forget that I was there.”\r\n\r\n“Enough, Monsieur d’Artagnan, enough of these dominating interests which\r\narise to keep the sun itself from my interests. I am founding a state in\r\nwhich there shall be but one master, as I promised you; the moment is at\r\nhand for me to keep my promise. You wish to be, according to your tastes\r\nor private friendships, free to destroy my plans and save my enemies? I\r\nwill thwart you or will drop you--seek a more compliant master. I know\r\nfull well that another king would not conduct himself as I do, and would\r\nallow himself to be dominated by you, at the risk of sending you\r\nsome day to keep company with M. Fouquet and the rest; but I have an\r\nexcellent memory, and for me, services are sacred titles to gratitude,\r\nto impunity. You shall only have this lesson, Monsieur d’Artagnan, as\r\nthe punishment of your want of discipline, and I will not imitate my\r\npredecessors in anger, not having imitated them in favor. And, then,\r\nother reasons make me act mildly towards you; in the first place,\r\nbecause you are a man of sense, a man of excellent sense, a man of\r\nheart, and that you will be a capital servant to him who shall have\r\nmastered you; secondly, because you will cease to have any motives for\r\ninsubordination. Your friends are now destroyed or ruined by me. These\r\nsupports on which your capricious mind instinctively relied I have\r\ncaused to disappear. At this moment, my soldiers have taken or killed\r\nthe rebels of Belle-Isle.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan became pale. “Taken or killed!” cried he. “Oh! sire, if you\r\nthought what you tell, if you were sure you were telling me the truth,\r\nI should forget all that is just, all that is magnanimous in your words,\r\nto call you a barbarous king, and an unnatural man. But I pardon you\r\nthese words,” said he, smiling with pride; “I pardon them to a young\r\nprince who does not know, who cannot comprehend what such men as M.\r\nd’Herblay, M. du Vallon, and myself are. Taken or killed! Ah! Ah! sire!\r\ntell me, if the news is true, how much has it cost you in men and money.\r\nWe will then reckon if the game has been worth the stakes.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke thus, the king went up to him in great anger, and said,\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan, your replies are those of a rebel! Tell me, if you\r\nplease, who is king of France? Do you know any other?”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” replied the captain of the musketeers, coldly, “I very well\r\nremember that one morning at Vaux you addressed that question to many\r\npeople who did not answer to it, whilst I, on my part, did answer to\r\nit. If I recognized my king on that day, when the thing was not easy,\r\nI think it would be useless to ask the question of me now, when your\r\nmajesty and I are alone.”\r\n\r\nAt these words Louis cast down his eyes. It appeared to him that the\r\nshade of the unfortunate Philippe passed between D’Artagnan and himself,\r\nto evoke the remembrance of that terrible adventure. Almost at the same\r\nmoment an officer entered and placed a dispatch in the hands of the\r\nking, who, in his turn, changed color, while reading it.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he, “what I learn here you would know later; it is\r\nbetter I should tell you, and that you should learn it from the mouth of\r\nyour king. A battle has taken place at Belle-Isle.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible?” said D’Artagnan, with a calm air, though his heart was\r\nbeating fast enough to choke him. “Well, sire?”\r\n\r\n“Well, monsieur--and I have lost a hundred and ten men.”\r\n\r\nA beam of joy and pride shone in the eyes of D’Artagnan. “And the\r\nrebels?” said he.\r\n\r\n“The rebels have fled,” said the king.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan could not restrain a cry of triumph. “Only,” added the king,\r\n“I have a fleet which closely blockades Belle-Isle, and I am certain not\r\na bark can escape.”\r\n\r\n“So that,” said the musketeer, brought back to his dismal idea, “if\r\nthese two gentlemen are taken--”\r\n\r\n“They will be hanged,” said the king, quietly.\r\n\r\n“And do they know it?” replied D’Artagnan, repressing his trembling.\r\n\r\n“They know it, because you must have told them yourself; and all the\r\ncountry knows it.”\r\n\r\n“Then, sire, they will never be taken alive, I will answer for that.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said the king, negligently, and taking up his letter again. “Very\r\nwell, they will be dead, then, Monsieur d’Artagnan, and that will come\r\nto the same thing, since I should only take them to have them hanged.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan wiped the sweat which flowed from his brow.\r\n\r\n“I have told you,” pursued Louis XIV., “that I would one day be an\r\naffectionate, generous, and constant master. You are now the only man of\r\nformer times worthy of my anger or my friendship. I will not spare you\r\neither sentiment, according to your conduct. Could you serve a king,\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan, who should have a hundred kings, his equals, in\r\nthe kingdom? Could I, tell me, do with such weak instruments the great\r\nthings I meditate? Did you ever see an artist effect great works with\r\nan unworthy tool? Far from us, monsieur, the old leaven of feudal abuse!\r\nThe Fronde, which threatened to ruin monarchy, has emancipated it. I\r\nam master at home, Captain d’Artagnan, and I shall have servants who,\r\nlacking, perhaps, your genius, will carry devotion and obedience to the\r\nverge of heroism. Of what consequence, I ask you, of what consequence\r\nis it that God has given no sense to arms and legs? It is to the head he\r\nhas given genius, and the head, you know, the rest obey. I am the head.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan started. Louis XIV. continued as if he had seen nothing,\r\nalthough this emotion had not by any means escaped him. “Now, let us\r\nconclude between us two the bargain I promised to make with you one day\r\nwhen you found me in a very strange predicament at Blois. Do me justice,\r\nmonsieur, when you admit I do not make any one pay for the tears of\r\nshame that I then shed. Look around you; lofty heads have bowed. Bow\r\nyours, or choose such exile as will suit you. Perhaps, when reflecting\r\nupon it, you will find your king has a generous heart, who reckons\r\nsufficiently upon your loyalty to allow you to leave him dissatisfied,\r\nwhen you possess a great state secret. You are a brave man; I know you\r\nto be so. Why have you judged me prematurely? Judge me from this day\r\nforward, D’Artagnan, and be as severe as you please.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan remained bewildered, mute, undecided for the first time in\r\nhis life. At last he had found an adversary worthy of him. This was no\r\nlonger trick, it was calculation; no longer violence, but strength; no\r\nlonger passion, but will; no longer boasting, but council. This young\r\nman who had brought down a Fouquet, and could do without a D’Artagnan,\r\nderanged the somewhat headstrong calculations of the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“Come, let us see what stops you?” said the king, kindly. “You have\r\ngiven in your resignation; shall I refuse to accept it? I admit that it\r\nmay be hard for such an old captain to recover lost good-humor.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” replied D’Artagnan, in a melancholy tone, “that is not my most\r\nserious care. I hesitate to take back my resignation because I am old in\r\ncomparison with you, and have habits difficult to abandon. Henceforward,\r\nyou must have courtiers who know how to amuse you--madmen who will get\r\nthemselves killed to carry out what you call your great works. Great\r\nthey will be, I feel--but, if by chance I should not think them so?\r\nI have seen war, sire, I have seen peace; I have served Richelieu and\r\nMazarin; I have been scorched with your father, at the fire of Rochelle;\r\nriddled with sword-thrusts like a sieve, having grown a new skin ten\r\ntimes, as serpents do. After affronts and injustices, I have a command\r\nwhich was formerly something, because it gave the bearer the right of\r\nspeaking as he liked to his king. But your captain of the musketeers\r\nwill henceforward be an officer guarding the outer doors. Truly, sire,\r\nif that is to be my employment from this time, seize the opportunity of\r\nour being on good terms, to take it from me. Do not imagine that I bear\r\nmalice; no, you have tamed me, as you say; but it must be confessed that\r\nin taming me you have lowered me; by bowing me you have convicted me of\r\nweakness. If you knew how well it suits me to carry my head high,\r\nand what a pitiful mien I shall have while scenting the dust of your\r\ncarpets! Oh! sire, I regret sincerely, and you will regret as I do, the\r\nold days when the king of France saw in every vestibule those insolent\r\ngentlemen, lean, always swearing--cross-grained mastiffs, who could bite\r\nmortally in the hour of danger or of battle. These men were the best of\r\ncourtiers to the hand which fed them--they would lick it; but for the\r\nhand that struck them, oh! the bite that followed! A little gold on the\r\nlace of their cloaks, a slender stomach in their _hauts-de-chausses_,\r\na little sparkling of gray in their dry hair, and you will behold the\r\nhandsome dukes and peers, the haughty _marechaux_ of France. But why\r\nshould I tell you all this? The king is master; he wills that I\r\nshould make verses, he wills that I should polish the mosaics of his\r\nante-chambers with satin shoes. _Mordioux!_ that is difficult, but I\r\nhave got over greater difficulties. I will do it. Why should I do it?\r\nBecause I love money?--I have enough. Because I am ambitious?--my career\r\nis almost at an end. Because I love the court? No. I will remain here\r\nbecause I have been accustomed for thirty years to go and take the\r\norderly word of the king, and to have said to me ‘Good evening,\r\nD’Artagnan,’ with a smile I did not beg for. That smile I will beg for!\r\nAre you content, sire?” And D’Artagnan bowed his silver head, upon which\r\nthe smiling king placed his white hand with pride.\r\n\r\n “Thanks, my old servant, my faithful friend,” said he. “As, reckoning\r\nfrom this day, I have no longer any enemies in France, it remains with\r\nme to send you to a foreign field to gather your marshal’s baton. Depend\r\nupon me for finding you an opportunity. In the meanwhile, eat of my very\r\nbest bread, and sleep in absolute tranquillity.”\r\n\r\n“That is all kind and well!” said D’Artagnan, much agitated. “But those\r\npoor men at Belle-Isle? One of them, in particular--so good! so brave!\r\nso true!”\r\n\r\n“Do you ask their pardon of me?”\r\n\r\n“Upon my knees, sire!”\r\n\r\n“Well! then, go and take it to them, if it be still in time. But do you\r\nanswer for them?”\r\n\r\n“With my life, sire.”\r\n\r\n“Go, then. To-morrow I set out for Paris. Return by that time, for I do\r\nnot wish you to leave me in the future.”\r\n\r\n“Be assured of that, sire,” said D’Artagnan, kissing the royal hand.\r\n\r\nAnd with a heart swelling with joy, he rushed out of the castle on his\r\nway to Belle-Isle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIV. M. Fouquet’s Friends.\r\n\r\nThe king had returned to Paris, and with him D’Artagnan, who, in\r\ntwenty-four hours, having made with greatest care all possible inquiries\r\nat Belle-Isle, succeeded in learning nothing of the secret so well kept\r\nby the heavy rock of Locmaria, which had fallen on the heroic Porthos.\r\nThe captain of the musketeers only knew what those two valiant\r\nmen--these two friends, whose defense he had so nobly taken up, whose\r\nlives he had so earnestly endeavored to save--aided by three faithful\r\nBretons, had accomplished against a whole army. He had seen, spread on\r\nthe neighboring heath, the human remains which had stained with clouted\r\nblood the scattered stones among the flowering broom. He learned also\r\nthat a bark had been seen far out at sea, and that, like a bird of prey,\r\na royal vessel had pursued, overtaken, and devoured the poor little\r\nbird that was flying with such palpitating wings. But there D’Artagnan’s\r\ncertainties ended. The field of supposition was thrown open. Now, what\r\ncould he conjecture? The vessel had not returned. It is true that a\r\nbrisk wind had prevailed for three days; but the corvette was known to\r\nbe a good sailer and solid in its timbers; it had no need to fear a gale\r\nof wind, and it ought, according to the calculation of D’Artagnan, to\r\nhave either returned to Brest, or come back to the mouth of the Loire.\r\nSuch was the news, ambiguous, it is true, but in some degree reassuring\r\nto him personally, which D’Artagnan brought to Louis XIV., when the\r\nking, followed by all the court, returned to Paris.\r\n\r\nLouis, satisfied with his success--Louis, more mild and affable as he\r\nfelt himself more powerful--had not ceased for an instant to ride beside\r\nthe carriage door of Mademoiselle de la Vallière. Everybody was anxious\r\nto amuse the two queens, so as to make them forget this abandonment by\r\nson and husband. Everything breathed the future, the past was nothing to\r\nanybody. Only that past was like a painful bleeding wound to the hearts\r\nof certain tender and devoted spirits. Scarcely was the king reinstalled\r\nin Paris, when he received a touching proof of this. Louis XIV. had\r\njust risen and taken his first repast when his captain of the musketeers\r\npresented himself before him. D’Artagnan was pale and looked unhappy.\r\nThe king, at the first glance, perceived the change in a countenance\r\ngenerally so unconcerned. “What is the matter, D’Artagnan?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Sire, a great misfortune has happened to me.”\r\n\r\n“Good heavens! what is that?”\r\n\r\n“Sire, I have lost one of my friends, M. du Vallon, in the affair of\r\nBelle-Isle.”\r\n\r\nAnd, while speaking these words, D’Artagnan fixed his falcon eye upon\r\nLouis XIV., to catch the first feeling that would show itself.\r\n\r\n“I knew it,” replied the king, quietly.\r\n\r\n“You knew it, and did not tell me!” cried the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“To what good? Your grief, my friend, was so well worthy of respect. It\r\nwas my duty to treat it gently. To have informed you of this misfortune,\r\nwhich I knew would pain you so greatly, D’Artagnan, would have been, in\r\nyour eyes, to have triumphed over you. Yes, I knew that M. du Vallon had\r\nburied himself beneath the rocks of Locmaria; I knew that M. d’Herblay\r\nhad taken one of my vessels with its crew, and had compelled it to\r\nconvey him to Bayonne. But I was willing you should learn these matters\r\nin a direct manner, in order that you might be convinced my friends are\r\nwith me respected and sacred; that always in me the man will sacrifice\r\nhimself to subjects, whilst the king is so often found to sacrifice men\r\nto majesty and power.”\r\n\r\n“But, sire, how could you know?”\r\n\r\n“How do you yourself know, D’Artagnan?”\r\n\r\n“By this letter, sire, which M. d’Herblay, free and out of danger,\r\nwrites me from Bayonne.”\r\n\r\n“Look here,” said the king, drawing from a casket placed upon the table\r\ncloset to the seat upon which D’Artagnan was leaning, “here is a letter\r\ncopied exactly from that of M. d’Herblay. Here is the very letter, which\r\nColbert placed in my hands a week before you received yours. I am well\r\nserved, you may perceive.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sire,” murmured the musketeer, “you were the only man whose star\r\nwas equal to the task of dominating the fortune and strength of my two\r\nfriends. You have used your power, sire, you will not abuse it, will\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“D’Artagnan,” said the king, with a smile beaming with kindness, “I\r\ncould have M. d’Herblay carried off from the territories of the king\r\nof Spain, and brought here, alive, to inflict justice upon him. But,\r\nD’Artagnan, be assured I will not yield to this first and natural\r\nimpulse. He is free--let him continue free.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sire! you will not always remain so clement, so noble, so generous\r\nas you have shown yourself with respect to me and M. d’Herblay; you will\r\nhave about you counselors who will cure you of that weakness.”\r\n\r\n“No, D’Artagnan, you are mistaken when you accuse my council of urging\r\nme to pursue rigorous measures. The advice to spare M. d’Herblay comes\r\nfrom Colbert himself.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sire!” said D’Artagnan, extremely surprised.\r\n\r\n“As for you,” continued the king, with a kindness very uncommon to him,\r\n“I have several pieces of good news to announce to you; but you shall\r\nknow them, my dear captain, the moment I have made my accounts all\r\nstraight. I have said that I wish to make, and would make, your fortune;\r\nthat promise will soon become reality.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand times thanks, sire! I can wait. But I implore you, whilst I\r\ngo and practice patience, that your majesty will deign to notice those\r\npoor people who have for so long a time besieged your ante-chamber, and\r\ncome humbly to lay a petition at your feet.”\r\n\r\n“Who are they?”\r\n\r\n“Enemies of your majesty.” The king raised his head.\r\n\r\n“Friends of M. Fouquet,” added D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Their names?”\r\n\r\n“M. Gourville, M. Pelisson, and a poet, M. Jean de la Fontaine.”\r\n\r\nThe king took a moment to reflect. “What do they want?”\r\n\r\n“I do not know.”\r\n\r\n“How do they appear?”\r\n\r\n“In great affliction.”\r\n\r\n“What do they say?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing.”\r\n\r\n“What do they do?”\r\n\r\n“They weep.”\r\n\r\n“Let them come in,” said the king, with a serious brow.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan turned rapidly on his heel, raised the tapestry which closed\r\nthe entrance to the royal chamber, and directing his voice to the\r\nadjoining room, cried, “Enter.”\r\n\r\nThe three men D’Artagnan had named immediately appeared at the door of\r\nthe cabinet in which were the king and his captain. A profound silence\r\nprevailed in their passage. The courtiers, at the approach of the\r\nfriends of the unfortunate superintendent of finances, drew back, as\r\nif fearful of being affected by contagion with disgrace and misfortune.\r\nD’Artagnan, with a quick step, came forward to take by the hand the\r\nunhappy men who stood trembling at the door of the cabinet; he led them\r\nin front of the king’s _fauteuil_, who, having placed himself in the\r\nembrasure of a window, awaited the moment of presentation, and was\r\npreparing himself to give the supplicants a rigorously diplomatic\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nThe first of the friends of Fouquet’s to advance was Pelisson. He did\r\nnot weep, but his tears were only restrained that the king might better\r\nhear his voice and prayer. Gourville bit his lips to check his tears,\r\nout of respect for the king. La Fontaine buried his face in his\r\nhandkerchief, and the only signs of life he gave were the convulsive\r\nmotions of his shoulders, raised by his sobs.\r\n\r\nThe king preserved his dignity. His countenance was impassible. He\r\neven maintained the frown which appeared when D’Artagnan announced his\r\nenemies. He made a gesture which signified, “Speak;” and he remained\r\nstanding, with his eyes fixed searchingly on these desponding men.\r\nPelisson bowed to the ground, and La Fontaine knelt as people do in\r\nchurches. This dismal silence, disturbed only by sighs and groans, began\r\nto excite in the king, not compassion, but impatience.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur Pelisson,” said he, in a sharp, dry tone. “Monsieur Gourville,\r\nand you, Monsieur--” and he did not name La Fontaine, “I cannot, without\r\nsensible displeasure, see you come to plead for one of the greatest\r\ncriminals it is the duty of justice to punish. A king does not allow\r\nhimself to soften save at the tears of the innocent, the remorse of the\r\nguilty. I have no faith either in the remorse of M. Fouquet or the tears\r\nof his friends, because the one is tainted to the very heart, and the\r\nothers ought to dread offending me in my own palace. For these reasons,\r\nI beg you, Monsieur Pelisson, Monsieur Gourville, and you, Monsieur--,\r\nto say nothing that will not plainly proclaim the respect you have for\r\nmy will.”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” replied Pelisson, trembling at these words, “we are come to say\r\nnothing to your majesty that is not the most profound expression of\r\nthe most sincere respect and love that are due to a king from all his\r\nsubjects. Your majesty’s justice is redoubtable; every one must yield to\r\nthe sentences it pronounces. We respectfully bow before it. Far from us\r\nthe idea of coming to defend him who has had the misfortune to offend\r\nyour majesty. He who has incurred your displeasure may be a friend of\r\nours, but he is an enemy to the state. We abandon him, but with tears,\r\nto the severity of the king.”\r\n\r\n“Besides,” interrupted the king, calmed by that supplicating voice,\r\nand those persuasive words, “my parliament will decide. I do not strike\r\nwithout first having weighed the crime; my justice does not wield the\r\nsword without employing first a pair of scales.”\r\n\r\n“Therefore we have every confidence in that impartiality of the king,\r\nand hope to make our feeble voices heard, with the consent of your\r\nmajesty, when the hour for defending an accused friend strikes.”\r\n\r\n“In that case, messieurs, what do you ask of me?” said the king, with\r\nhis most imposing air.\r\n\r\n“Sire,” continued Pelisson, “the accused has a wife and family. The\r\nlittle property he had was scarcely sufficient to pay his debts,\r\nand Madame Fouquet, since her husband’s captivity, is abandoned by\r\neverybody. The hand of your majesty strikes like the hand of God. When\r\nthe Lord sends the curse of leprosy or pestilence into a family,\r\nevery one flies and shuns the abode of the leprous or plague-stricken.\r\nSometimes, but very rarely, a generous physician alone ventures to\r\napproach the ill-reputed threshold, passes it with courage, and risks\r\nhis life to combat death. He is the last resource of the dying, the\r\nchosen instrument of heavenly mercy. Sire, we supplicate you, with\r\nclasped hands and bended knees, as a divinity is supplicated! Madame\r\nFouquet has no longer any friends, no longer any means of support; she\r\nweeps in her deserted home, abandoned by all those who besieged its\r\ndoors in the hour of prosperity; she has neither credit nor hope left.\r\nAt least, the unhappy wretch upon whom your anger falls receives from\r\nyou, however culpable he may be, his daily bread though moistened by\r\nhis tears. As much afflicted, more destitute than her husband, Madame\r\nFouquet--the lady who had the honor to receive your majesty at her\r\ntable--Madame Fouquet, the wife of the ancient superintendent of your\r\nmajesty’s finances, Madame Fouquet has no longer bread.”\r\n\r\nHere the mortal silence which had chained the breath of Pelisson’s two\r\nfriends was broken by an outburst of sobs; and D’Artagnan, whose chest\r\nheaved at hearing this humble prayer, turned round towards the angle of\r\nthe cabinet to bite his mustache and conceal a groan.\r\n\r\nThe king had preserved his eye dry and his countenance severe; but\r\nthe blood had mounted to his cheeks, and the firmness of his look was\r\nvisibly diminished.\r\n\r\n“What do you wish?” said he, in an agitated voice.\r\n\r\n“We come humbly to ask your majesty,” replied Pelisson, upon whom\r\nemotion was fast gaining, “to permit us, without incurring the\r\ndispleasure of your majesty, to lend to Madame Fouquet two thousand\r\npistoles collected among the old friends of her husband, in order that\r\nthe widow may not stand in need of the necessaries of life.”\r\n\r\nAt the word _widow_, pronounced by Pelisson whilst Fouquet was still\r\nalive, the king turned very pale;--his pride disappeared; pity rose from\r\nhis heart to his lips; he cast a softened look upon the men who knelt\r\nsobbing at his feet.\r\n\r\n“God forbid,” said he, “that I should confound the innocent with the\r\nguilty. They know me but ill who doubt my mercy towards the weak. I\r\nstrike none but the arrogant. Do, messieurs, do all that your hearts\r\ncounsel you to assuage the grief of Madame Fouquet. Go, messieurs--go!”\r\n\r\nThe three now rose in silence with dry eyes. The tears had been scorched\r\naway by contact with their burning cheeks and eyelids. They had not\r\nthe strength to address their thanks to the king, who himself cut short\r\ntheir solemn reverences by entrenching himself suddenly behind the\r\n_fauteuil_.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan remained alone with the king.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said he, approaching the young prince, who interrogated him with\r\nhis look. “Well, my master! If you had not the device which belongs to\r\nyour sun, I would recommend you one which M. Conrart might translate\r\ninto eclectic Latin, ‘Calm with the lowly; stormy with the strong.’”\r\n\r\nThe king smiled, and passed into the next apartment, after having said\r\nto D’Artagnan, “I give you the leave of absence you must want to put the\r\naffairs of your friend, the late M. du Vallon, in order.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LV. Porthos’s Will.\r\n\r\nAt Pierrefonds everything was in mourning. The courts were deserted--the\r\nstables closed--the parterres neglected. In the basins, the fountains,\r\nformerly so jubilantly fresh and noisy, had stopped of themselves. Along\r\nthe roads around the chateau came a few grave personages mounted on\r\nmules or country nags. These were rural neighbors, cures and bailiffs of\r\nadjacent estates. All these people entered the chateau silently, handed\r\ntheir horses to a melancholy-looking groom, and directed their steps,\r\nconducted by a huntsman in black, to the great dining-room, where\r\nMousqueton received them at the door. Mousqueton had become so thin in\r\ntwo days that his clothes moved upon him like an ill-fitting scabbard in\r\nwhich the sword-blade dances at each motion. His face, composed of red\r\nand white, like that of the Madonna of Vandyke, was furrowed by two\r\nsilver rivulets which had dug their beds in his cheeks, as full formerly\r\nas they had become flabby since his grief began. At each fresh arrival,\r\nMousqueton found fresh tears, and it was pitiful to see him press\r\nhis throat with his fat hand to keep from bursting into sobs and\r\nlamentations. All these visits were for the purpose of hearing the\r\nreading of Porthos’s will, announced for that day, and at which all the\r\ncovetous friends of the dead man were anxious to be present, as he had\r\nleft no relations behind him.\r\n\r\nThe visitors took their places as they arrived, and the great room had\r\njust been closed when the clock struck twelve, the hour fixed for the\r\nreading of the important document. Porthos’s procureur--and that\r\nwas naturally the successor of Master Coquenard--commenced by slowly\r\nunfolding the vast parchment upon which the powerful hand of Porthos had\r\ntraced his sovereign will. The seal broken--the spectacles put on--the\r\npreliminary cough having sounded--every one pricked up his ears.\r\nMousqueton had squatted himself in a corner, the better to weep and the\r\nbetter to hear. All at once the folding-doors of the great room, which\r\nhad been shut, were thrown open as if by magic, and a warlike figure\r\nappeared upon the threshold, resplendent in the full light of the sun.\r\nThis was D’Artagnan, who had come alone to the gate, and finding nobody\r\nto hold his stirrup, had tied his horse to the knocker and announced\r\nhimself. The splendor of daylight invading the room, the murmur of all\r\npresent, and, more than all, the instinct of the faithful dog, drew\r\nMousqueton from his reverie; he raised his head, recognized the old\r\nfriend of his master, and, screaming with grief, he embraced his knees,\r\nwatering the floor with his tears. D’Artagnan raised the poor intendant,\r\nembraced him as if he had been a brother, and, having nobly saluted the\r\nassembly, who all bowed as they whispered to each other his name, he\r\nwent and took his seat at the extremity of the great carved oak hall,\r\nstill holding by the hand poor Mousqueton, who was suffocating with\r\nexcess of woe, and sank upon the steps. Then the procureur, who, like\r\nthe rest, was considerably agitated, commenced.\r\n\r\nPorthos, after a profession of faith of the most Christian character,\r\nasked pardon of his enemies for all the injuries he might have done\r\nthem. At this paragraph, a ray of inexpressible pride beamed from the\r\neyes of D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nHe recalled to his mind the old soldier; all those enemies of Porthos\r\nbrought to earth by his valiant hand; he reckoned up the numbers\r\nof them, and said to himself that Porthos had acted wisely, not to\r\nenumerate his enemies or the injuries done to them, or the task would\r\nhave been too much for the reader. Then came the following schedule of\r\nhis extensive lands:\r\n\r\n“I possess at this present time, by the grace of God--\r\n\r\n“1. The domain of Pierrefonds, lands, woods, meadows, waters, and\r\nforests, surrounded by good walls.\r\n\r\n“2. The domain of Bracieux, chateaux, forests, plowed lands, forming\r\nthree farms.\r\n\r\n“3. The little estate Du Vallon, so named because it is in the valley.”\r\n (Brave Porthos!)\r\n\r\n“4. Fifty farms in Touraine, amounting to five hundred acres.\r\n\r\n“5. Three mills upon the Cher, bringing in six hundred livres each.\r\n\r\n“6. Three fish-pools in Berry, producing two hundred livres a year.\r\n\r\n“As to my personal or movable property, so called because it can be\r\nmoved, as is so well explained by my learned friend the bishop of\r\nVannes--” (D’Artagnan shuddered at the dismal remembrance attached to\r\nthat name)--the procureur continued imperturbably--“they consist--”\r\n\r\n“1. In goods which I cannot detail here for want of room, and which\r\nfurnish all my chateaux or houses, but of which the list is drawn up by\r\nmy intendant.”\r\n\r\nEvery one turned his eyes towards Mousqueton, who was still lost in\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\n“2. In twenty horses for saddle and draught, which I have particularly\r\nat my chateau of Pierrefonds, and which are called--Bayard, Roland,\r\nCharlemagne, Pepin, Dunois, La Hire, Ogier, Samson, Milo, Nimrod,\r\nUrganda, Armida, Flastrade, Dalilah, Rebecca, Yolande, Finette,\r\nGrisette, Lisette, and Musette.\r\n\r\n“3. In sixty dogs, forming six packs, divided as follows: the first, for\r\nthe stag; the second, for the wolf; the third, for the wild boar; the\r\nfourth, for the hare; and the two others, for setters and protection.\r\n\r\n“4. In arms for war and the chase contained in my gallery of arms.\r\n\r\n“5. My wines of Anjou, selected for Athos, who liked them formerly;\r\nmy wines of Burgundy, Champagne, Bordeaux, and Spain, stocking eight\r\ncellars and twelve vaults, in my various houses.\r\n\r\n“6. My pictures and statues, which are said to be of great value, and\r\nwhich are sufficiently numerous to fatigue the sight.\r\n\r\n“7. My library, consisting of six thousand volumes, quite new, and have\r\nnever been opened.\r\n\r\n“8. My silver plate, which is perhaps a little worn, but which ought to\r\nweigh from a thousand to twelve hundred pounds, for I had great trouble\r\nin lifting the coffer that contained it and could not carry it more than\r\nsix times round my chamber.\r\n\r\n“9. All these objects, in addition to the table and house linen, are\r\ndivided in the residences I liked the best.”\r\n\r\nHere the reader stopped to take breath. Every one sighed, coughed, and\r\nredoubled his attention. The procureur resumed:\r\n\r\n“I have lived without having any children, and it is probable I never\r\nshall have any, which to me is a cutting grief. And yet I am mistaken,\r\nfor I have a son, in common with my other friends; that is, M. Raoul\r\nAuguste Jules de Bragelonne, the true son of M. le Comte de la Fere.\r\n\r\n“This young nobleman appears to me extremely worthy to succeed the\r\nvaliant gentleman of whom I am the friend and very humble servant.”\r\n\r\nHere a sharp sound interrupted the reader. It was D’Artagnan’s sword,\r\nwhich, slipping from his baldric, had fallen on the sonorous flooring.\r\nEvery one turned his eyes that way, and saw that a large tear had rolled\r\nfrom the thick lid of D’Artagnan, half-way down to his aquiline nose,\r\nthe luminous edge of which shone like a little crescent moon.\r\n\r\n“This is why,” continued the procureur, “I have left all my property,\r\nmovable, or immovable, comprised in the above enumerations, to M. le\r\nVicomte Raoul Auguste Jules de Bragelonne, son of M. le Comte de la\r\nFere, to console him for the grief he seems to suffer, and enable him to\r\nadd more luster to his already glorious name.”\r\n\r\nA vague murmur ran through the auditory. The procureur continued,\r\nseconded by the flashing eye of D’Artagnan, which, glancing over the\r\nassembly, quickly restored the interrupted silence:\r\n\r\n“On condition that M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne do give to M. le\r\nChevalier d’Artagnan, captain of the king’s musketeers, whatever the\r\nsaid Chevalier d’Artagnan may demand of my property. On condition that\r\nM. le Vicomte de Bragelonne do pay a good pension to M. le Chevalier\r\nd’Herblay, my friend, if he should need it in exile. I leave to my\r\nintendant Mousqueton all of my clothes, of city, war, or chase, to the\r\nnumber of forty-seven suits, in the assurance that he will wear them\r\ntill they are worn out, for the love of and in remembrance of his\r\nmaster. Moreover, I bequeath to M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne my old\r\nservant and faithful friend Mousqueton, already named, providing that\r\nthe said vicomte shall so act that Mousqueton shall declare, when dying,\r\nhe has never ceased to be happy.”\r\n\r\nOn hearing these words, Mousqueton bowed, pale and trembling; his\r\nshoulders shook convulsively; his countenance, compressed by a frightful\r\ngrief, appeared from between his icy hands, and the spectators saw him\r\nstagger and hesitate, as if, though wishing to leave the hall, he did\r\nnot know the way.\r\n\r\n“Mousqueton, my good friend,” said D’Artagnan, “go and make your\r\npreparations. I will take you with me to Athos’s house, whither I shall\r\ngo on leaving Pierrefonds.”\r\n\r\nMousqueton made no reply. He scarcely breathed, as if everything in that\r\nhall would from that time be foreign. He opened the door, and slowly\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe procureur finished his reading, after which the greater part\r\nof those who had come to hear the last will of Porthos dispersed by\r\ndegrees, many disappointed, but all penetrated with respect. As\r\nfor D’Artagnan, thus left alone, after having received the formal\r\ncompliments of the procureur, he was lost in admiration of the wisdom of\r\nthe testator, who had so judiciously bestowed his wealth upon the most\r\nnecessitous and the most worthy, with a delicacy that neither nobleman\r\nnor courtier could have displayed more kindly. When Porthos enjoined\r\nRaoul de Bragelonne to give D’Artagnan all that he would ask, he knew\r\nwell, our worthy Porthos, that D’Artagnan would ask or take nothing; and\r\nin case he did demand anything, none but himself could say what. Porthos\r\nleft a pension to Aramis, who, if he should be inclined to ask too much,\r\nwas checked by the example of D’Artagnan; and that word _exile_, thrown\r\nout by the testator, without apparent intention, was it not the mildest,\r\nmost exquisite criticism upon that conduct of Aramis which had brought\r\nabout the death of Porthos? But there was no mention of Athos in the\r\ntestament of the dead. Could the latter for a moment suppose that the\r\nson would not offer the best part to the father? The rough mind of\r\nPorthos had fathomed all these causes, seized all these shades more\r\nclearly than law, better than custom, with more propriety than taste.\r\n\r\n“Porthos had indeed a heart,” said D’Artagnan to himself with a sigh.\r\nAs he made this reflection, he fancied he hard a groan in the room above\r\nhim; and he thought immediately of poor Mousqueton, whom he felt it was\r\na pleasing duty to divert from his grief. For this purpose he left the\r\nhall hastily to seek the worthy intendant, as he had not returned. He\r\nascended the staircase leading to the first story, and perceived, in\r\nPorthos’s own chamber, a heap of clothes of all colors and materials,\r\nupon which Mousqueton had laid himself down after heaping them all on\r\nthe floor together. It was the legacy of the faithful friend. Those\r\nclothes were truly his own; they had been given to him; the hand of\r\nMousqueton was stretched over these relics, which he was kissing with\r\nhis lips, with all his face, and covered with his body. D’Artagnan\r\napproached to console the poor fellow.\r\n\r\n“My God!” said he, “he does not stir--he has fainted!”\r\n\r\nBut D’Artagnan was mistaken. Mousqueton was dead! Dead, like the dog\r\nwho, having lost his master, crawls back to die upon his cloak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVI. The Old Age of Athos.\r\n\r\nWhile these affairs were separating forever the four musketeers,\r\nformerly bound together in a manner that seemed indissoluble, Athos,\r\nleft alone after the departure of Raoul, began to pay his tribute to\r\nthat foretaste of death which is called the absence of those we love.\r\nBack in his house at Blois, no longer having even Grimaud to receive\r\na poor smile as he passed through the parterre, Athos daily felt\r\nthe decline of vigor of a nature which for so long a time had seemed\r\nimpregnable. Age, which had been kept back by the presence of the\r\nbeloved object, arrived with that _cortege_ of pains and inconveniences,\r\nwhich grows by geometrical accretion. Athos had no longer his son to\r\ninduce him to walk firmly, with head erect, as a good example; he had no\r\nlonger, in those brilliant eyes of the young man, an ever-ardent focus\r\nat which to kindle anew the fire of his looks. And then, must it be\r\nsaid, that nature, exquisite in tenderness and reserve, no longer\r\nfinding anything to understand its feelings, gave itself up to grief\r\nwith all the warmth of common natures when they yield to joy. The Comte\r\nde la Fere, who had remained a young man to his sixty-second year;\r\nthe warrior who had preserved his strength in spite of fatigue; his\r\nfreshness of mind in spite of misfortune, his mild serenity of soul and\r\nbody in spite of Milady, in spite of Mazarin, in spite of La Vallière;\r\nAthos had become an old man in a week, from the moment at which he lost\r\nthe comfort of his later youth. Still handsome, though bent, noble, but\r\nsad, he sought, since his solitude, the deeper glades where sunshine\r\nscarcely penetrated. He discontinued all the mighty exercises he had\r\nenjoyed through life, when Raoul was no longer with him. The servants,\r\naccustomed to see him stirring with the dawn at all seasons, were\r\nastonished to hear seven o’clock strike before their master quitted his\r\nbed. Athos remained in bed with a book under his pillow--but he did not\r\nsleep, neither did he read. Remaining in bed that he might no longer\r\nhave to carry his body, he allowed his soul and spirit to wander from\r\ntheir envelope and return to his son, or to God. [6]\r\n\r\nHis people were sometimes terrified to see him, for hours together,\r\nabsorbed in silent reverie, mute and insensible; he no longer heard the\r\ntimid step of the servant who came to the door of his chamber to watch\r\nthe sleeping or waking of his master. It often occurred that he forgot\r\nthe day had half passed away, that the hours for the two first meals\r\nwere gone by. Then he was awakened. He rose, descended to his shady\r\nwalk, then came out a little into the sun, as though to partake of its\r\nwarmth for a minute in memory of his absent child. And then the dismal\r\nmonotonous walk recommenced, until, exhausted, he regained the chamber\r\nand his bed, his domicile by choice. For several days the comte did not\r\nspeak a single word. He refused to receive the visits that were paid\r\nhim, and during the night he was seen to relight his lamp and pass long\r\nhours in writing, or examining parchments.\r\n\r\nAthos wrote one of these letters to Vannes, another to Fontainebleau;\r\nthey remained without answers. We know why: Aramis had quitted France,\r\nand D’Artagnan was traveling from Nantes to Paris, from Paris to\r\nPierrefonds. His _valet de chambre_ observed that he shortened his walk\r\nevery day by several turns. The great alley of limes soon became too\r\nlong for feet that used to traverse it formerly a hundred times a day.\r\nThe comte walked feebly as far as the middle trees, seated himself upon\r\na mossy bank that sloped towards a sidewalk, and there waited the return\r\nof his strength, or rather the return of night. Very shortly a hundred\r\nsteps exhausted him. At length Athos refused to rise at all; he declined\r\nall nourishment, and his terrified people, although he did not complain,\r\nalthough he wore a smile upon his lips, although he continued to speak\r\nwith his sweet voice--his people went to Blois in search of the ancient\r\nphysician of the late Monsieur, and brought him to the Comte de la Fere\r\nin such a fashion that he could see the comte without being himself\r\nseen. For this purpose, they placed him in a closet adjoining the\r\nchamber of the patient, and implored him not to show himself, for fear\r\nof displeasing their master, who had not asked for a physician. The\r\ndoctor obeyed. Athos was a sort of model for the gentlemen of the\r\ncountry; the Blaisois boasted of possessing this sacred relic of French\r\nglory. Athos was a great seigneur compared with such nobles as the king\r\nimprovised by touching with his artificial scepter the patched-up trunks\r\nof the heraldic trees of the province.\r\n\r\nPeople respected Athos, we say, and they loved him. The physician could\r\nnot bear to see his people weep, to see flock round him the poor of the\r\ncanton, to whom Athos had so often given life and consolation by his\r\nkind words and his charities. He examined, therefore, from the depths\r\nof his hiding-place, the nature of that mysterious malady which bent\r\nand aged more mortally every day a man but lately so full of life and a\r\ndesire to live. He remarked upon the cheeks of Athos the hectic hue of\r\nfever, which feeds upon itself; slow fever, pitiless, born in a fold\r\nof the heart, sheltering itself behind that rampart, growing from\r\nthe suffering it engenders, at once cause and effect of a perilous\r\nsituation. The comte spoke to nobody; he did not even talk to\r\nhimself. His thought feared noise; it approached to that degree of\r\nover-excitement which borders upon ecstasy. Man thus absorbed, though he\r\ndoes not yet belong to God, already appertains no longer to the earth.\r\nThe doctor remained for several hours studying this painful struggle of\r\nthe will against superior power; he was terrified at seeing those eyes\r\nalways fixed, ever directed on some invisible object; was terrified at\r\nthe monotonous beating of that heart from which never a sigh arose\r\nto vary the melancholy state; for often pain becomes the hope of the\r\nphysician. Half a day passed away thus. The doctor formed his resolution\r\nlike a brave man; he issued suddenly from his place of retreat, and went\r\nstraight up to Athos, who beheld him without evincing more surprise than\r\nif he had understood nothing of the apparition.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le comte, I crave your pardon,” said the doctor, coming up\r\nto the patient with open arms; “but I have a reproach to make you--you\r\nshall hear me.” And he seated himself by the pillow of Athos, who had\r\ngreat trouble in rousing himself from his preoccupation.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter, doctor?” asked the comte, after a silence.\r\n\r\n“The matter is, you are ill, monsieur, and have had no advice.”\r\n\r\n“I! ill!” said Athos, smiling.\r\n\r\n“Fever, consumption, weakness, decay, monsieur le comte!”\r\n\r\n“Weakness!” replied Athos; “is it possible? I do not get up.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come! monsieur le comte, no subterfuges; you are a good\r\nChristian?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” said Athos.\r\n\r\n“Is it your wish to kill yourself?”\r\n\r\n“Never, doctor.”\r\n\r\n“Well! monsieur, you are in a fair way of doing so. Thus to remain is\r\nsuicide. Get well! monsieur le comte, get well!”\r\n\r\n“Of what? Find the disease first. For my part, I never knew myself\r\nbetter; never did the sky appear more blue to me; never did I take more\r\ncare of my flowers.”\r\n\r\n“You have a hidden grief.”\r\n\r\n“Concealed!--not at all; the absence of my son, doctor; that is my\r\nmalady, and I do not conceal it.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le comte, your son lives, he is strong, he has all the future\r\nbefore him--the future of men of merit, of his race; live for him--”\r\n\r\n“But I do live, doctor; oh! be satisfied of that,” added he, with a\r\nmelancholy smile; “for as long as Raoul lives, it will be plainly known,\r\nfor as long as he lives, I shall live.”\r\n\r\n“What do you say?”\r\n\r\n“A very simple thing. At this moment, doctor, I leave life suspended\r\nwithin me. A forgetful, dissipated, indifferent life would be beyond my\r\nstrength, now I have no longer Raoul with me. You do not ask the lamp\r\nto burn when the match has not illumed the flame; do not ask me to live\r\namidst noise and merriment. I vegetate, I prepare myself, I wait. Look,\r\ndoctor; remember those soldiers we have so often seen together at the\r\nports, where they were waiting to embark; lying down, indifferent, half\r\non one element, half on the other; they were neither at the place where\r\nthe sea was going to carry them, nor at the place the earth was going\r\nto lose them; baggage prepared, minds on the stretch, arms stacked--they\r\nwaited. I repeat it, the word is the one which paints my present life.\r\nLying down like the soldiers, my ear on the stretch for the report that\r\nmay reach me, I wish to be ready to set out at the first summons. Who\r\nwill make me that summons? life or death? God or Raoul? My baggage\r\nis packed, my soul is prepared, I await the signal--I wait, doctor, I\r\nwait!”\r\n\r\nThe doctor knew the temper of that mind; he appreciated the strength\r\nof that body; he reflected for the moment, told himself that words\r\nwere useless, remedies absurd, and left the chateau, exhorting Athos’s\r\nservants not to quit him for a moment.\r\n\r\nThe doctor being gone, Athos evinced neither anger nor vexation at\r\nhaving been disturbed. He did not even desire that all letters that\r\ncame should be brought to him directly. He knew very well that every\r\ndistraction which should arise would be a joy, a hope, which his\r\nservants would have paid with their blood to procure him. Sleep had\r\nbecome rare. By intense thinking, Athos forgot himself, for a few hours\r\nat most, in a reverie most profound, more obscure than other people\r\nwould have called a dream. The momentary repose which this forgetfulness\r\nthus gave the body, still further fatigued the soul, for Athos lived a\r\ndouble life during these wanderings of his understanding. One night,\r\nhe dreamt that Raoul was dressing himself in a tent, to go upon an\r\nexpedition commanded by M. de Beaufort in person. The young man was sad;\r\nhe clasped his cuirass slowly, and slowly he girded on his sword.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” asked his father, tenderly.\r\n\r\n“What afflicts me is the death of Porthos, ever so dear a friend,”\r\n replied Raoul. “I suffer here the grief you soon will feel at home.”\r\n\r\nAnd the vision disappeared with the slumber of Athos. At daybreak one of\r\nhis servants entered his master’s apartment, and gave him a letter which\r\ncame from Spain.\r\n\r\n“The writing of Aramis,” thought the comte; and he read.\r\n\r\n“Porthos is dead!” cried he, after the first lines. “Oh! Raoul, Raoul!\r\nthanks! thou keepest thy promise, thou warnest me!”\r\n\r\nAnd Athos, seized with a mortal sweat, fainted in his bed, without any\r\nother cause than weakness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVII. Athos’s Vision.\r\n\r\nWhen this fainting of Athos had ceased, the comte, almost ashamed of\r\nhaving given way before this superior natural event, dressed himself\r\nand ordered his horse, determined to ride to Blois, to open more certain\r\ncorrespondences with either Africa, D’Artagnan, or Aramis. In fact, this\r\nletter from Aramis informed the Comte de la Fere of the bad success\r\nof the expedition of Belle-Isle. It gave him sufficient details of the\r\ndeath of Porthos to move the tender and devoted heart of Athos to its\r\ninnermost fibers. Athos wished to go and pay his friend Porthos a last\r\nvisit. To render this honor to his companion in arms, he meant to send\r\nto D’Artagnan, to prevail upon him to recommence the painful voyage to\r\nBelle-Isle, to accomplish in his company that sad pilgrimage to the tomb\r\nof the giant he had so much loved, then to return to his dwelling to\r\nobey that secret influence which was conducting him to eternity by a\r\nmysterious road. But scarcely had his joyous servants dressed their\r\nmaster, whom they saw with pleasure preparing for a journey which might\r\ndissipate his melancholy; scarcely had the comte’s gentlest horse been\r\nsaddled and brought to the door, when the father of Raoul felt his\r\nhead become confused, his legs give way, and he clearly perceived\r\nthe impossibility of going one step further. He ordered himself to be\r\ncarried into the sun; they laid him upon his bed of moss where he passed\r\na full hour before he could recover his spirits. Nothing could be more\r\nnatural than this weakness after then inert repose of the latter days.\r\nAthos took a _bouillon_, to give him strength, and bathed his dried\r\nlips in a glassful of the wine he loved the best--that old Anjou wine\r\nmentioned by Porthos in his admirable will. Then, refreshed, free in\r\nmind, he had his horse brought again; but only with the aid of his\r\nservants was he able painfully to climb into the saddle. He did not go a\r\nhundred paces; a shivering seized him again at the turning of the road.\r\n\r\n“This is very strange!” said he to his _valet de chambre_, who\r\naccompanied him.\r\n\r\n“Let us stop, monsieur--I conjure you!” replied the faithful servant;\r\n“how pale you are getting!”\r\n\r\n“That will not prevent my pursuing my route, now I have once started,”\r\n replied the comte. And he gave his horse his head again. But suddenly,\r\nthe animal, instead of obeying the thought of his master, stopped. A\r\nmovement, of which Athos was unconscious, had checked the bit.\r\n\r\n“Something,” said Athos, “wills that I should go no further. Support\r\nme,” added he, stretching out his arms; “quick! come closer! I feel my\r\nmuscles relax--I shall fall from my horse.”\r\n\r\nThe valet had seen the movement made by his master at the moment he\r\nreceived the order. He went up to him quickly, received the comte in his\r\narms, and as they were not yet sufficiently distant from the house\r\nfor the servants, who had remained at the door to watch their master’s\r\ndeparture, not to perceive the disorder in the usually regular\r\nproceeding of the comte, the valet called his comrades by gestures and\r\nvoice, and all hastened to his assistance. Athos had gone but a few\r\nsteps on his return, when he felt himself better again. His strength\r\nseemed to revive and with it the desire to go to Blois. He made his\r\nhorse turn round: but, at the animal’s first steps, he sunk again into a\r\nstate of torpor and anguish.\r\n\r\n“Well! decidedly,” said he, “it is _willed_ that I should stay at home.”\r\n His people flocked around him; they lifted him from his horse, and\r\ncarried him as quickly as possible into the house. Everything was\r\nprepared in his chamber, and they put him to bed.\r\n\r\n“You will be sure to remember,” said he, disposing himself to sleep,\r\n“that I expect letters from Africa this very day.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur will no doubt hear with pleasure that Blaisois’s son is gone\r\non horseback, to gain an hour over the courier of Blois,” replied his\r\n_valet de chambre_.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” replied Athos, with his placid smile.\r\n\r\nThe comte fell asleep, but his disturbed slumber resembled torture\r\nrather than repose. The servant who watched him saw several times the\r\nexpression of internal suffering shadowed on his features. Perhaps Athos\r\nwas dreaming.\r\n\r\nThe day passed away. Blaisois’s son returned; the courier had brought\r\nno news. The comte reckoned the minutes with despair; he shuddered when\r\nthose minutes made an hour. The idea that he was forgotten seized him\r\nonce, and brought on a fearful pang of the heart. Everybody in the house\r\nhad given up all hopes of the courier--his hour had long passed. Four\r\ntimes the express sent to Blois had repeated his journey, and there was\r\nnothing to the address of the comte. Athos knew that the courier only\r\narrived once a week. Here, then, was a delay of eight mortal days to be\r\nendured. He commenced the night in this painful persuasion. All that a\r\nsick man, irritated by suffering, can add of melancholy suppositions to\r\nprobabilities already gloomy, Athos heaped up during the early hours of\r\nthis dismal night. The fever rose: it invaded the chest, where the fire\r\nsoon caught, according to the expression of the physician, who had been\r\nbrought back from Blois by Blaisois at his last journey. Soon it gained\r\nthe head. The physician made two successive bleedings, which dislodged\r\nit for the time, but left the patient very weak, and without power of\r\naction in anything but his brain. And yet this redoubtable fever had\r\nceased. It besieged with its last palpitations the tense extremities; it\r\nended by yielding as midnight struck.\r\n\r\nThe physician, seeing the incontestable improvement, returned to Blois,\r\nafter having ordered some prescriptions, and declared that the comte was\r\nsaved. Then commenced for Athos a strange, indefinable state. Free to\r\nthink, his mind turned towards Raoul, that beloved son. His imagination\r\npenetrated the fields of Africa in the environs of Gigelli, where M. de\r\nBeaufort must have landed with his army. A waste of gray rocks, rendered\r\ngreen in certain parts by the waters of the sea, when it lashed the\r\nshore in storms and tempest. Beyond, the shore, strewed over with these\r\nrocks like gravestones, ascended, in form of an amphitheater among\r\nmastic-trees and cactus, a sort of small town, full of smoke, confused\r\nnoises, and terrified movements. All of a sudden, from the bosom of\r\nthis smoke arose a flame, which succeeded, creeping along the houses,\r\nin covering the entire surface of the town, and increased by degrees,\r\nuniting in its red and angry vortices tears, screams, and supplicating\r\narms outstretched to Heaven.\r\n\r\nThere was, for a moment, a frightful _pele-mele_ of timbers falling\r\nto pieces, of swords broken, of stones calcined, trees burnt and\r\ndisappearing. It was a strange thing that in this chaos, in which Athos\r\ndistinguished raised arms, in which he heard cries, sobs, and groans,\r\nhe did not see one human figure. The cannon thundered at a distance,\r\nmusketry madly barked, the sea moaned, flocks made their escape,\r\nbounding over the verdant slope. But not a soldier to apply the match\r\nto the batteries of cannon, not a sailor to assist in maneuvering the\r\nfleet, not a shepherd in charge of the flocks. After the ruin of the\r\nvillage, the destruction of the forts which dominated it, a ruin and\r\ndestruction magically wrought without the co-operation of a single human\r\nbeing, the flames were extinguished, the smoke began to subside, then\r\ndiminished in intensity, paled and disappeared entirely. Night then came\r\nover the scene; night dark upon the earth, brilliant in the firmament.\r\nThe large blazing stars which spangled the African sky glittered and\r\ngleamed without illuminating anything.\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued, which gave, for a moment, repose to the troubled\r\nimagination of Athos; and as he felt that that which he saw was not\r\nterminated, he applied more attentively the eyes of his understanding\r\non the strange spectacle which his imagination had presented. This\r\nspectacle was soon continued for him. A mild pale moon rose behind the\r\ndeclivities of the coast, streaking at first the undulating ripples of\r\nthe sea, which appeared to have calmed after the roaring it had sent\r\nforth during the vision of Athos--the moon, we say, shed its diamonds\r\nand opals upon the briers and bushes of the hills. The gray rocks, so\r\nmany silent and attentive phantoms, appeared to raise their heads to\r\nexamine likewise the field of battle by the light of the moon, and Athos\r\nperceived that the field, empty during the combat, was now strewn with\r\nfallen bodies.\r\n\r\nAn inexpressible shudder of fear and horror seized his soul as he\r\nrecognized the white and blue uniforms of the soldiers of Picardy,\r\nwith their long pikes and blue handles, and muskets marked with the\r\n_fleur-de-lis_ on the butts. When he saw all the gaping wounds, looking\r\nup to the bright heavens as if to demand back of them the souls to which\r\nthey had opened a passage,--when he saw the slaughtered horses, stiff,\r\ntheir tongues hanging out at one side of their mouths, sleeping in the\r\nshiny blood congealed around them, staining their furniture and their\r\nmanes,--when he saw the white horse of M. de Beaufort, with his head\r\nbeaten to pieces, in the first ranks of the dead, Athos passed a cold\r\nhand over his brow, which he was astonished not to find burning. He was\r\nconvinced by this touch that he was present, as a spectator, without\r\ndelirium’s dreadful aid, the day after the battle fought upon the shores\r\nof Gigelli by the army of the expedition, which he had seen leave the\r\ncoast of France and disappear upon the dim horizon, and of which he had\r\nsaluted with thought and gesture the last cannon-shot fired by the duke\r\nas a signal of farewell to his country.\r\n\r\nWho can paint the mortal agony with which his soul followed, like a\r\nvigilant eye, these effigies of clay-cold soldiers, and examined them,\r\none after the other, to see if Raoul slept among them? Who can express\r\nthe intoxication of joy with which Athos bowed before God, and thanked\r\nHim for not having seen him he sought with so much fear among the dead?\r\nIn fact, fallen in their ranks, stiff, icy, the dead, still recognizable\r\nwith ease, seemed to turn with complacency towards the Comte de la Fere,\r\nto be the better seen by him, during his sad review. But yet, he\r\nwas astonished, while viewing all these bodies, not to perceive the\r\nsurvivors. To such a point did the illusion extend, that this vision\r\nwas for him a real voyage made by the father into Africa, to obtain more\r\nexact information respecting his son.\r\n\r\nFatigued, therefore, with having traversed seas and continents, he\r\nsought repose under one of the tents sheltered behind a rock, on the\r\ntop of which floated the white _fleur-de-lised_ pennon. He looked for\r\na soldier to conduct him to the tent of M. de Beaufort. Then, while his\r\neye was wandering over the plain, turning on all sides, he saw a white\r\nform appear behind the scented myrtles. This figure was clothed in the\r\ncostume of an officer; it held in its hand a broken sword; it advanced\r\nslowly towards Athos, who, stopping short and fixing his eyes upon it,\r\nneither spoke nor moved, but wished to open his arms, because in this\r\nsilent officer he had already recognized Raoul. The comte attempted to\r\nutter a cry, but it was stifled in his throat. Raoul, with a gesture,\r\ndirected him to be silent, placing his finger on his lips and drawing\r\nback by degrees, without Athos being able to see his legs move. The\r\ncomte, still paler than Raoul, followed his son, painfully traversing\r\nbriers and bushes, stones and ditches, Raoul not appearing to touch the\r\nearth, no obstacle seeming to impede the lightness of his march.\r\nThe comte, whom the inequalities of the path fatigued, soon stopped,\r\nexhausted. Raoul still continued to beckon him to follow him. The tender\r\nfather, to whom love restored strength, made a last effort, and climbed\r\nthe mountain after the young man, who attracted him by gesture and by\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nAt length he gained the crest of the hill, and saw, thrown out in black,\r\nupon the horizon whitened by the moon, the aerial form of Raoul.\r\nAthos reached forth his hand to get closer to his beloved son upon the\r\nplateau, and the latter also stretched out his; but suddenly, as if the\r\nyoung man had been drawn away in his own despite, still retreating, he\r\nleft the earth, and Athos saw the clear blue sky shine between the feet\r\nof his child and the ground of the hill. Raoul rose insensibly into the\r\nvoid, smiling, still calling with gesture:--he departed towards heaven.\r\nAthos uttered a cry of tenderness and terror. He looked below again. He\r\nsaw a camp destroyed, and all those white bodies of the royal army, like\r\nso many motionless atoms. And, then, raising his head, he saw the figure\r\nof his son still beckoning him to climb the mystic void.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LVIII. The Angel of Death.\r\n\r\nAthos was at this part of his marvelous vision, when the charm was\r\nsuddenly broken by a great noise rising from the outer gates. A horse\r\nwas heard galloping over the hard gravel of the great alley, and the\r\nsound of noisy and animated conversations ascended to the chamber in\r\nwhich the comte was dreaming. Athos did not stir from the place he\r\noccupied; he scarcely turned his head towards the door to ascertain the\r\nsooner what these noises could be. A heavy step ascended the stairs; the\r\nhorse, which had recently galloped, departed slowly towards the stables.\r\nGreat hesitation appeared in the steps, which by degrees approached the\r\nchamber. A door was opened, and Athos, turning a little towards the part\r\nof the room the noise came from, cried, in a weak voice:\r\n\r\n“It is a courier from Africa, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur le comte,” replied a voice which made the father of Raoul\r\nstart upright in his bed.\r\n\r\n“Grimaud!” murmured he. And the sweat began to pour down his face.\r\nGrimaud appeared in the doorway. It was no longer the Grimaud we have\r\nseen, still young with courage and devotion, when he jumped the first\r\ninto the boat destined to convey Raoul de Bragelonne to the vessels of\r\nthe royal fleet. ‘Twas now a stern and pale old man, his clothes covered\r\nwith dust, and hair whitened by old age. He trembled whilst leaning\r\nagainst the door-frame, and was near falling on seeing, by the light of\r\nthe lamps, the countenance of his master. These two men who had lived so\r\nlong together in a community of intelligence, and whose eyes, accustomed\r\nto economize expressions, knew how to say so many things silently--these\r\ntwo old friends, one as noble as the other in heart, if they were\r\nunequal in fortune and birth, remained tongue-tied whilst looking at\r\neach other. By the exchange of a single glance they had just read to\r\nthe bottom of each other’s hearts. The old servitor bore upon his\r\ncountenance the impression of a grief already old, the outward token of\r\na grim familiarity with woe. He appeared to have no longer in use more\r\nthan a single version of his thoughts. As formerly he was accustomed not\r\nto speak much, he was now accustomed not to smile at all. Athos read at\r\na glance all these shades upon the visage of his faithful servant, and\r\nin the same tone he would have employed to speak to Raoul in his dream:\r\n\r\n“Grimaud,” said he, “Raoul is dead. _Is it not so?_”\r\n\r\nBehind Grimaud the other servants listened breathlessly, with their\r\neyes fixed upon the bed of their sick master. They heard the terrible\r\nquestion, and a heart-breaking silence followed.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the old man, heaving the monosyllable from his chest with\r\na hoarse, broken sigh.\r\n\r\nThen arose voices of lamentation, which groaned without measure, and\r\nfilled with regrets and prayers the chamber where the agonized father\r\nsought with his eyes the portrait of his son. This was for Athos like\r\nthe transition which led to his dream. Without uttering a cry, without\r\nshedding a tear, patient, mild, resigned as a martyr, he raised his eyes\r\ntowards Heaven, in order there to see again, rising above the mountain\r\nof Gigelli, the beloved shade that was leaving him at the moment of\r\nGrimaud’s arrival. Without doubt, while looking towards the heavens,\r\nresuming his marvelous dream, he repassed by the same road by which the\r\nvision, at once so terrible and sweet, had led him before; for after\r\nhaving gently closed his eyes, he reopened them and began to smile: he\r\nhad just seen Raoul, who had smiled upon him. With his hands joined upon\r\nhis breast, his face turned towards the window, bathed by the fresh air\r\nof night, which brought upon its wings the aroma of the flowers and\r\nthe woods, Athos entered, never again to come out of it, into the\r\ncontemplation of that paradise which the living never see. God willed,\r\nno doubt, to open to this elect the treasures of eternal beatitude,\r\nat this hour when other men tremble with the idea of being severely\r\nreceived by the Lord, and cling to this life they know, in the dread of\r\nthe other life of which they get but merest glimpses by the dismal murky\r\ntorch of death. Athos was spirit-guided by the pure serene soul of his\r\nson, which aspired to be like the paternal soul. Everything for this\r\njust man was melody and perfume in the rough road souls take to return\r\nto the celestial country. After an hour of this ecstasy, Athos softly\r\nraised his hands as white as wax; the smile did not quit his lips, and\r\nhe murmured low, so low as scarcely to be audible, these three words\r\naddressed to God or to Raoul:\r\n\r\n“HERE I AM!”\r\n\r\nAnd his hands fell slowly, as though he himself had laid them on the\r\nbed.\r\n\r\nDeath had been kind and mild to this noble creature. It had spared him\r\nthe tortures of the agony, convulsions of the last departure; had opened\r\nwith an indulgent finger the gates of eternity to that noble soul. God\r\nhad no doubt ordered it thus that the pious remembrance of this death\r\nshould remain in the hearts of those present, and in the memory of other\r\nmen--a death which caused to be loved the passage from this life to the\r\nother by those whose existence upon this earth leads them not to dread\r\nthe last judgment. Athos preserved, even in the eternal sleep, that\r\nplacid and sincere smile--an ornament which was to accompany him to the\r\ntomb. The quietude and calm of his fine features made his servants for\r\na long time doubt whether he had really quitted life. The comte’s people\r\nwished to remove Grimaud, who, from a distance, devoured the face now\r\nquickly growing marble-pale, and did not approach, from pious fear of\r\nbringing to him the breath of death. But Grimaud, fatigued as he was,\r\nrefused to leave the room. He sat himself down upon the threshold,\r\nwatching his master with the vigilance of a sentinel, jealous to receive\r\neither his first waking look or his last dying sigh. The noises all were\r\nquiet in the house--every one respected the slumber of their lord. But\r\nGrimaud, by anxiously listening, perceived that the comte no longer\r\nbreathed. He raised himself with his hands leaning on the ground, looked\r\nto see if there did not appear some motion in the body of his master.\r\nNothing! Fear seized him; he rose completely up, and, at the very\r\nmoment, heard some one coming up the stairs. A noise of spurs knocking\r\nagainst a sword--a warlike sound familiar to his ears--stopped him as he\r\nwas going towards the bed of Athos. A voice more sonorous than brass or\r\nsteel resounded within three paces of him.\r\n\r\n“Athos! Athos! my friend!” cried this voice, agitated even to tears.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur le Chevalier d’Artagnan,” faltered out Grimaud.\r\n\r\n“Where is he? Where is he?” continued the musketeer. Grimaud seized\r\nhis arm in his bony fingers, and pointed to the bed, upon the sheets of\r\nwhich the livid tints of death already showed.\r\n\r\nA choked respiration, the opposite to a sharp cry, swelled the throat of\r\nD’Artagnan. He advanced on tip-toe, trembling, frightened at the noise\r\nhis feet made on the floor, his heart rent by a nameless agony. He\r\nplaced his ear to the breast of Athos, his face to the comte’s mouth.\r\nNeither noise, nor breath! D’Artagnan drew back. Grimaud, who had\r\nfollowed him with his eyes, and for whom each of his movements had been\r\na revelation, came timidly; seated himself at the foot of the bed, and\r\nglued his lips to the sheet which was raised by the stiffened feet of\r\nhis master. Then large drops began to flow from his red eyes. This old\r\nman in invincible despair, who wept, bent doubled without uttering a\r\nword, presented the most touching spectacle that D’Artagnan, in a life\r\nso filled with emotion, had ever met with.\r\n\r\nThe captain resumed standing in contemplation before that smiling dead\r\nman, who seemed to have burnished his last thought, to give his best\r\nfriend, the man he had loved next to Raoul, a gracious welcome even\r\nbeyond life. And for reply to that exalted flattery of hospitality,\r\nD’Artagnan went and kissed Athos fervently on the brow, and with his\r\ntrembling fingers closed his eyes. Then he seated himself by the pillow\r\nwithout dread of that dead man, who had been so kind and affectionate\r\nto him for five and thirty years. He was feeding his soul with the\r\nremembrances the noble visage of the comte brought to his mind in\r\ncrowds--some blooming and charming as that smile--some dark, dismal, and\r\nicy as that visage with its eyes now closed to all eternity.\r\n\r\nAll at once the bitter flood which mounted from minute to minute invaded\r\nhis heart, and swelled his breast almost to bursting. Incapable of\r\nmastering his emotion, he arose, and tearing himself violently from the\r\nchamber where he had just found dead him to whom he came to report the\r\nnews of the death of Porthos, he uttered sobs so heart-rending that the\r\nservants, who seemed only to wait for an explosion of grief, answered to\r\nit by their lugubrious clamors, and the dogs of the late comte by their\r\nlamentable howlings. Grimaud was the only one who did not lift up his\r\nvoice. Even in the paroxysm of his grief he would not have dared to\r\nprofane the dead, or for the first time disturb the slumber of his\r\nmaster. Had not Athos always bidden him be dumb?\r\n\r\nAt daybreak D’Artagnan, who had wandered about the lower hall, biting\r\nhis fingers to stifle his sighs--D’Artagnan went up once more; and\r\nwatching the moments when Grimaud turned his head towards him, he made\r\nhim a sign to come to him, which the faithful servant obeyed without\r\nmaking more noise than a shadow. D’Artagnan went down again, followed\r\nby Grimaud; and when he had gained the vestibule, taking the old man’s\r\nhands, “Grimaud,” said he, “I have seen how the father died; now let me\r\nknow about the son.”\r\n\r\nGrimaud drew from his breast a large letter, upon the envelope of which\r\nwas traced the address of Athos. He recognized the writing of M. de\r\nBeaufort, broke the seal, and began to read, while walking about in the\r\nfirst steel-chill rays of dawn, in the dark alley of old limes, marked\r\nby the still visible footsteps of the comte who had just died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LIX. The Bulletin.\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Beaufort wrote to Athos. The letter destined for the living\r\nonly reached the dead. God had changed the address.\r\n\r\n“MY DEAR COMTE,” wrote the prince, in his large, school-boy’s hand,--“a\r\ngreat misfortune has struck us amidst a great triumph. The king\r\nloses one of the bravest of soldiers. I lose a friend. You lose M. de\r\nBragelonne. He has died gloriously, so gloriously that I have not the\r\nstrength to weep as I could wish. Receive my sad compliments, my dear\r\ncomte. Heaven distributes trials according to the greatness of our\r\nhearts. This is an immense one, but not above your courage. Your good\r\nfriend,\r\n\r\n“LE DUC DE BEAUFORT.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter contained a relation written by one of the prince’s\r\nsecretaries. It was the most touching recital, and the most true,\r\nof that dismal episode which unraveled two existences. D’Artagnan,\r\naccustomed to battle emotions, and with a heart armed against\r\ntenderness, could not help starting on reading the name of Raoul, the\r\nname of that beloved boy who had become a shade now--like his father.\r\n\r\n“In the morning,” said the prince’s secretary, “monseigneur commanded\r\nthe attack. Normandy and Picardy had taken positions in the rocks\r\ndominated by the heights of the mountain, upon the declivity of which\r\nwere raised the bastions of Gigelli.\r\n\r\n“The cannon opened the action; the regiments marched full of resolution;\r\nthe pikemen with pikes elevated, the musket-bearers with their weapons\r\nready. The prince followed attentively the march and movements of the\r\ntroops, so as to be able to sustain them with a strong reserve. With\r\nmonseigneur were the oldest captains and his aides-de-camp. M. le\r\nVicomte de Bragelonne had received orders not to leave his highness. In\r\nthe meantime the enemy’s cannon, which at first thundered with little\r\nsuccess against the masses, began to regulate their fire, and the balls,\r\nbetter directed, killed several men near the prince. The regiments\r\nformed in column, and, advancing against the ramparts, were rather\r\nroughly handled. There was a sort of hesitation in our troops, who found\r\nthemselves ill-seconded by the artillery. In fact, the batteries which\r\nhad been established the evening before had but a weak and uncertain\r\naim, on account of their position. The upward direction of the aim\r\nlessened the justness of the shots as well as their range.\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur, comprehending the bad effect of this position on the siege\r\nartillery, commanded the frigates moored in the little road to commence\r\na regular fire against the place. M. de Bragelonne offered himself at\r\nonce to carry this order. But monseigneur refused to acquiesce in the\r\nvicomte’s request. Monseigneur was right, for he loved and wished to\r\nspare the young nobleman. He was quite right, and the event took upon\r\nitself to justify his foresight and refusal; for scarcely had the\r\nsergeant charged with the message solicited by M. de Bragelonne gained\r\nthe seashore, when two shots from long carbines issued from the enemy’s\r\nranks and laid him low. The sergeant fell, dyeing the sand with his\r\nblood; observing which, M. de Bragelonne smiled at monseigneur, who said\r\nto him, ‘You see, vicomte, I have saved your life. Report that, some\r\nday, to M. le Comte de la Fere, in order that, learning it from you, he\r\nmay thank me.’ The young nobleman smiled sadly, and replied to the duke,\r\n‘It is true, monseigneur, that but for your kindness I should have been\r\nkilled, where the poor sergeant has fallen, and should be at rest.’ M.\r\nde Bragelonne made this reply in such a tone that monseigneur answered\r\nhim warmly, ‘_Vrai Dieu!_ Young man, one would say that your mouth\r\nwaters for death; but, by the soul of Henry IV., I have promised your\r\nfather to bring you back alive; and, please the Lord, I mean to keep my\r\nword.’\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur de Bragelonne colored, and replied, in a lower voice,\r\n‘Monseigneur, pardon me, I beseech you. I have always had a desire\r\nto meet good opportunities; and it is so delightful to distinguish\r\nourselves before our general, particularly when that general is M. le\r\nDuc de Beaufort.’\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur was a little softened by this; and, turning to the officers\r\nwho surrounded him, gave different orders. The grenadiers of the two\r\nregiments got near enough to the ditches and intrenchments to launch\r\ntheir grenades, which had but small effect. In the meanwhile, M.\r\nd’Estrees, who commanded the fleet, having seen the attempt of the\r\nsergeant to approach the vessels, understood that he must act without\r\norders, and opened fire. Then the Arabs, finding themselves seriously\r\ninjured by the balls from the fleet, and beholding the destruction and\r\nthe ruin of their walls, uttered the most fearful cries. Their horsemen\r\ndescended the mountain at a gallop, bent over their saddles, and rushed\r\nfull tilt upon the columns of infantry, which, crossing their pikes,\r\nstopped this mad assault. Repulsed by the firm attitude of the\r\nbattalion, the Arabs threw themselves with fury towards the\r\n_etat-major_, which was not on its guard at that moment.\r\n\r\n“The danger was great; monseigneur drew his sword; his secretaries and\r\npeople imitated him; the officers of the suite engaged in combat with\r\nthe furious Arabs. It was then M. de Bragelonne was able to satisfy the\r\ninclination he had so clearly shown from the commencement of the action.\r\nHe fought near the prince with the valor of a Roman, and killed three\r\nArabs with his small sword. But it was evident that his bravery did not\r\narise from that sentiment of pride so natural to all who fight. It was\r\nimpetuous, affected, even forced; he sought to glut, intoxicate himself\r\nwith strife and carnage. He excited himself to such a degree that\r\nmonseigneur called to him to stop. He must have heard the voice of\r\nmonseigneur, because we who were close to him heard it. He did not,\r\nhowever, stop, but continued his course to the intrenchments. As M.\r\nde Bragelonne was a well-disciplined officer, this disobedience to the\r\norders of monseigneur very much surprised everybody, and M. de Beaufort\r\nredoubled his earnestness, crying, ‘Stop, Bragelonne! Where are you\r\ngoing? Stop,’ repeated monseigneur, ‘I command you!’\r\n\r\n“We all, imitating the gesture of M. le duc, we all raised our hands.\r\nWe expected that the cavalier would turn bridle; but M. de Bragelonne\r\ncontinued to ride towards the palisades.\r\n\r\n“‘Stop, Bragelonne!’ repeated the prince, in a very loud voice, ‘stop!\r\nin the name of your father!’\r\n\r\n“At these words M. de Bragelonne turned round; his countenance expressed\r\na lively grief, but he did not stop; we then concluded that his horse\r\nmust have run away with him. When M. le duc saw cause to conclude that\r\nthe vicomte was no longer master of his horse, and had watched him\r\nprecede the first grenadiers, his highness cried, ‘Musketeers, kill\r\nhis horse! A hundred pistoles for the man who kills his horse!’ But who\r\ncould expect to hit the beast without at least wounding his rider?\r\nNo one dared the attempt. At length one presented himself; he was a\r\nsharp-shooter of the regiment of Picardy, named Luzerne, who took aim\r\nat the animal, fired, and hit him in the quarters, for we saw the blood\r\nredden the hair of the horse. Instead of falling, the cursed jennet was\r\nirritated, and carried him on more furiously than ever. Every Picard who\r\nsaw this unfortunate young man rushing on to meet certain death,\r\nshouted in the loudest manner, ‘Throw yourself off, monsieur le\r\nvicomte!--off!--off! throw yourself off!’ M. de Bragelonne was an\r\nofficer much beloved in the army. Already had the vicomte arrived within\r\npistol-shot of the ramparts, when a discharge was poured upon him\r\nthat enshrouded him in fire and smoke. We lost sight of him; the smoke\r\ndispersed; he was on foot, upright; his horse was killed.\r\n\r\n“The vicomte was summoned to surrender by the Arabs, but he made them\r\na negative sign with his head, and continued to march towards the\r\npalisades. This was a mortal imprudence. Nevertheless the entire army\r\nwas pleased that he would not retreat, since ill-chance had led him\r\nso near. He marched a few paces further, and the two regiments clapped\r\ntheir hands. It was at this moment the second discharge shook the walls,\r\nand the Vicomte de Bragelonne again disappeared in the smoke; but this\r\ntime the smoke dispersed in vain; we no longer saw him standing. He was\r\ndown, with his head lower than his legs, among the bushes, and the Arabs\r\nbegan to think of leaving their intrenchments to come and cut off\r\nhis head or take his body--as is the custom with the infidels. But\r\nMonseigneur le Duc de Beaufort had followed all this with his eyes, and\r\nthe sad spectacle drew from him many painful sighs. He then cried aloud,\r\nseeing the Arabs running like white phantoms among the mastic-trees,\r\n‘Grenadiers! lancers! will you let them take that noble body?’\r\n\r\n“Saying these words and waving his sword, he himself rode towards the\r\nenemy. The regiments, rushing in his steps, ran in their turn, uttering\r\ncries as terrible as those of the Arabs were wild.\r\n\r\n“The combat commenced over the body of M. de Bragelonne, and with such\r\ninveteracy was it fought that a hundred and sixty Arabs were left\r\nupon the field, by the side of at least fifty of our troops. It was\r\na lieutenant from Normandy who took the body of the vicomte on his\r\nshoulders and carried it back to the lines. The advantage was, however,\r\npursued, the regiments took the reserve with them, and the enemy’s\r\npalisades were utterly destroyed. At three o’clock the fire of the Arabs\r\nceased; the hand-to-hand fight lasted two hours; it was a massacre. At\r\nfive o’clock we were victorious at all points; the enemy had abandoned\r\nhis positions, and M. le duc ordered the white flag to be planted on the\r\nsummit of the little mountain. It was then we had time to think of M. de\r\nBragelonne, who had eight large wounds in his body, through which almost\r\nall his blood had welled away. Still, however, he had breathed, which\r\nafforded inexpressible joy to monseigneur, who insisted on being\r\npresent at the first dressing of the wounds and the consultation of the\r\nsurgeons. There were two among them who declared M. de Bragelonne would\r\nlive. Monseigneur threw his arms around their necks, and promised them a\r\nthousand louis each if they could save him.\r\n\r\n“The vicomte heard these transports of joy, and whether he was in\r\ndespair, or whether he suffered much from his wounds, he expressed\r\nby his countenance a contradiction, which gave rise to reflection,\r\nparticularly in one of the secretaries when he had heard what follows.\r\nThe third surgeon was the brother of Sylvain de Saint-Cosme, the most\r\nlearned of them all. He probed the wounds in his turn, and said nothing.\r\nM. de Bragelonne fixed his eyes steadily upon the skillful surgeon,\r\nand seemed to interrogate his every movement. The latter, upon being\r\nquestioned by monseigneur, replied that he saw plainly three mortal\r\nwounds out of eight, but so strong was the constitution of the wounded,\r\nso rich was he in youth, and so merciful was the goodness of God, that\r\nperhaps M. de Bragelonne might recover, particularly if he did not\r\nmove in the slightest manner. Frere Sylvain added, turning towards his\r\nassistants, ‘Above everything, do not allow him to move, even a finger,\r\nor you will kill him;’ and we all left the tent in very low spirits.\r\nThat secretary I have mentioned, on leaving the tent, thought he\r\nperceived a faint and sad smile glide over the lips of M. de Bragelonne\r\nwhen the duke said to him, in a cheerful, kind voice, ‘We will save you,\r\nvicomte, we will save you yet.’\r\n\r\n“In the evening, when it was believed the wounded youth had taken some\r\nrepose, one of the assistants entered his tent, but rushed out again\r\nimmediately, uttering loud cries. We all ran up in disorder, M. le duc\r\nwith us, and the assistant pointed to the body of M. de Bragelonne\r\nupon the ground, at the foot of his bed, bathed in the remainder of his\r\nblood. It appeared that he had suffered some convulsion, some delirium,\r\nand that he had fallen; that the fall had accelerated his end, according\r\nto the prognosis of Frere Sylvain. We raised the vicomte; he was cold\r\nand dead. He held a lock of fair hair in his right hand, and that hand\r\nwas tightly pressed upon his heart.”\r\n\r\nThen followed the details of the expedition, and of the victory obtained\r\nover the Arabs. D’Artagnan stopped at the account of the death of poor\r\nRaoul. “Oh!” murmured he, “unhappy boy! a suicide!” And turning his\r\neyes towards the chamber of the chateau, in which Athos slept in eternal\r\nsleep, “They kept their words with each other,” said he, in a low voice;\r\n“now I believe them to be happy; they must be reunited.” And he\r\nreturned through the parterre with slow and melancholy steps. All the\r\nvillage--all the neighborhood--were filled with grieving neighbors\r\nrelating to each other the double catastrophe, and making preparations\r\nfor the funeral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter LX. The Last Canto of the Poem.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, all the _noblesse_ of the provinces, of the environs, and\r\nwherever messengers had carried the news, might have been seen arriving\r\nin detachments. D’Artagnan had shut himself up, without being willing\r\nto speak to anybody. Two such heavy deaths falling upon the captain,\r\nso closely after the death of Porthos, for a long time oppressed that\r\nspirit which had hitherto been so indefatigable and invulnerable.\r\nExcept Grimaud, who entered his chamber once, the musketeer saw neither\r\nservants nor guests. He supposed, from the noises in the house, and the\r\ncontinual coming and going, that preparations were being made for the\r\nfuneral of the comte. He wrote to the king to ask for an extension of\r\nhis leave of absence. Grimaud, as we have said, had entered D’Artagnan’s\r\napartment, had seated himself upon a joint-stool near the door, like a\r\nman who meditates profoundly; then, rising, he made a sign to D’Artagnan\r\nto follow him. The latter obeyed in silence. Grimaud descended to the\r\ncomte’s bed-chamber, showed the captain with his finger the place of the\r\nempty bed, and raised his eyes eloquently towards Heaven.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied D’Artagnan, “yes, good Grimaud--now with the son he loved\r\nso much!”\r\n\r\nGrimaud left the chamber, and led the way to the hall, where, according\r\nto the custom of the province, the body was laid out, previously to\r\nbeing put away forever. D’Artagnan was struck at seeing two open coffins\r\nin the hall. In reply to the mute invitation of Grimaud, he approached,\r\nand saw in one of them Athos, still handsome in death, and, in the\r\nother, Raoul with his eyes closed, his cheeks pearly as those of the\r\nPalls of Virgil, with a smile on his violet lips. He shuddered at seeing\r\nthe father and son, those two departed souls, represented on earth by\r\ntwo silent, melancholy bodies, incapable of touching each other, however\r\nclose they might be.\r\n\r\n“Raoul here!” murmured he. “Oh! Grimaud, why did you not tell me this?”\r\n\r\nGrimaud shook his head, and made no reply; but taking D’Artagnan by\r\nthe hand, he led him to the coffin, and showed him, under the thin\r\nwinding-sheet, the black wounds by which life had escaped. The captain\r\nturned away his eyes, and, judging it was useless to question Grimaud,\r\nwho would not answer, he recollected that M. de Beaufort’s secretary had\r\nwritten more than he, D’Artagnan, had had the courage to read. Taking up\r\nthe recital of the affair which had cost Raoul his life, he found these\r\nwords, which ended the concluding paragraph of the letter:\r\n\r\n“Monseigneur le duc has ordered that the body of monsieur le vicomte\r\nshould be embalmed, after the manner practiced by the Arabs when they\r\nwish their dead to be carried to their native land; and monsieur le duc\r\nhas appointed relays, so that the same confidential servant who brought\r\nup the young man might take back his remains to M. le Comte de la Fere.”\r\n\r\n“And so,” thought D’Artagnan, “I shall follow thy funeral, my dear\r\nboy--I, already old--I, who am of no value on earth--and I shall scatter\r\ndust upon that brow I kissed but two months since. God has willed it to\r\nbe so. Thou hast willed it to be so, thyself. I have no longer the right\r\neven to weep. Thou hast chosen death; it seemed to thee a preferable\r\ngift to life.”\r\n\r\nAt length arrived the moment when the chill remains of these two\r\ngentlemen were to be given back to mother earth. There was such an\r\naffluence of military and other people that up to the place of the\r\nsepulture, which was a little chapel on the plain, the road from the\r\ncity was filled with horsemen and pedestrians in mourning. Athos had\r\nchosen for his resting-place the little inclosure of a chapel erected by\r\nhimself near the boundary of his estates. He had had the stones, cut\r\nin 1550, brought from an old Gothic manor-house in Berry, which had\r\nsheltered his early youth. The chapel, thus rebuilt, transported, was\r\npleasing to the eye beneath its leafy curtains of poplars and sycamores.\r\nIt was ministered in every Sunday, by the cure of the neighboring bourg,\r\nto whom Athos paid an allowance of two hundred francs for this service;\r\nand all the vassals of his domain, with their families, came thither to\r\nhear mass, without having any occasion to go to the city.\r\n\r\nBehind the chapel extended, surrounded by two high hedges of\r\nhazel, elder and white thorn, and a deep ditch, the little\r\ninclosure--uncultivated, though gay in its sterility; because the mosses\r\nthere grew thick, wild heliotrope and ravenelles there mingled perfumes,\r\nwhile from beneath an ancient chestnut issued a crystal spring, a\r\nprisoner in its marble cistern, and on the thyme all around alighted\r\nthousands of bees from the neighboring plants, whilst chaffinches and\r\nredthroats sang cheerfully among the flower-spangled hedges. It was to\r\nthis place the somber coffins were carried, attended by a silent and\r\nrespectful crowd. The office of the dead being celebrated, the last\r\nadieux paid to the noble departed, the assembly dispersed, talking,\r\nalong the roads, of the virtues and mild death of the father, of the\r\nhopes the son had given, and of his melancholy end upon the arid coast\r\nof Africa.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, all noises were extinguished, like the lamps\r\nilluminating the humble nave. The minister bowed for the last time to\r\nthe altar and the still fresh graves; then, followed by his assistant,\r\nhe slowly took the road back to the presbytery. D’Artagnan, left alone,\r\nperceived that night was coming on. He had forgotten the hour, thinking\r\nonly of the dead. He arose from the oaken bench on which he was seated\r\nin the chapel, and wished, as the priest had done, to go and bid a last\r\nadieu to the double grave which contained his two lost friends.\r\n\r\nA woman was praying, kneeling on the moist earth. D’Artagnan stopped at\r\nthe door of the chapel, to avoid disturbing her, and also to endeavor to\r\nfind out who was the pious friend who performed this sacred duty with\r\nso much zeal and perseverance. The unknown had hidden her face in her\r\nhands, which were white as alabaster. From the noble simplicity of her\r\ncostume, she must be a woman of distinction. Outside the inclosure were\r\nseveral horses mounted by servants; a travelling carriage was in waiting\r\nfor this lady. D’Artagnan in vain sought to make out what caused her\r\ndelay. She continued praying, and frequently pressed her handkerchief to\r\nher face, by which D’Artagnan perceived she was weeping. He beheld her\r\nstrike her breast with the compunction of a Christian woman. He heard\r\nher several times exclaim as from a wounded heart: “Pardon! pardon!” And\r\nas she appeared to abandon herself entirely to her grief, as she threw\r\nherself down, almost fainting, exhausted by complaints and prayers,\r\nD’Artagnan, touched by this love for his so much regretted friends,\r\nmade a few steps towards the grave, in order to interrupt the melancholy\r\ncolloquy of the penitent with the dead. But as soon as his step sounded\r\non the gravel, the unknown raised her head, revealing to D’Artagnan a\r\nface aflood with tears, a well-known face. It was Mademoiselle de la\r\nVallière! “Monsieur d’Artagnan!” murmured she.\r\n\r\n“You!” replied the captain, in a stern voice, “you here!--oh! madame, I\r\nshould better have liked to see you decked with flowers in the mansion\r\nof the Comte de la Fere. You would have wept less--and they too--and I!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur!” said she, sobbing.\r\n\r\n“For it was you,” added this pitiless friend of the dead,--“it was you\r\nwho sped these two men to the grave.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! spare me!”\r\n\r\n“God forbid, madame, that I should offend a woman, or that I should make\r\nher weep in vain; but I must say that the place of the murderer is not\r\nupon the grave of her victims.” She wished to reply.\r\n\r\n“What I now tell you,” added he, coldly, “I have already told the king.”\r\n\r\nShe clasped her hands. “I know,” said she, “I have caused the death of\r\nthe Vicomte de Bragelonne.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you know it?”\r\n\r\n“The news arrived at court yesterday. I have traveled during the night\r\nforty leagues to come and ask pardon of the comte, whom I supposed to be\r\nstill living, and to pray God, on the tomb of Raoul, that he would\r\nsend me all the misfortunes I have merited, except a single one. Now,\r\nmonsieur, I know that the death of the son has killed the father; I have\r\ntwo crimes to reproach myself with; I have two punishments to expect\r\nfrom Heaven.”\r\n\r\n“I will repeat to you, mademoiselle,” said D’Artagnan, “what M. de\r\nBragelonne said of you, at Antibes, when he already meditated death: ‘If\r\npride and coquetry have misled her, I pardon her while despising her. If\r\nlove has produced her error, I pardon her, but I swear that no one could\r\nhave loved her as I have done.’”\r\n\r\n“You know,” interrupted Louise, “that of my love I was about to\r\nsacrifice myself; you know whether I suffered when you met me lost,\r\ndying, abandoned. Well! never have I suffered so much as now; because\r\nthen I hoped, desired,--now I have no longer anything to wish for;\r\nbecause this death drags all my joy into the tomb; because I can no\r\nlonger dare to love without remorse, and I feel that he whom I love--oh!\r\nit is but just!--will repay me with the tortures I have made others\r\nundergo.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan made no reply; he was too well convinced that she was not\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” added she, “dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, do not overwhelm me\r\nto-day, I again implore you! I am like the branch torn from the trunk, I\r\nno longer hold to anything in this world--a current drags me on, I\r\nknow not whither. I love madly, even to the point of coming to tell it,\r\nwretch that I am, over the ashes of the dead, and I do not blush for\r\nit--I have no remorse on this account. Such love is a religion. Only, as\r\nhereafter you will see me alone, forgotten, disdained; as you will see\r\nme punished, as I am destined to be punished, spare me in my ephemeral\r\nhappiness, leave it to me for a few days, for a few minutes. Now, even\r\nat the moment I am speaking to you, perhaps it no longer exists. My God!\r\nthis double murder is perhaps already expiated!”\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking thus, the sound of voices and of horses drew the\r\nattention of the captain. M. de Saint-Aignan came to seek La\r\nVallière. “The king,” he said, “is a prey to jealousy and uneasiness.”\r\n Saint-Aignan did not perceive D’Artagnan, half concealed by the trunk\r\nof a chestnut-tree which shaded the double grave. Louise thanked\r\nSaint-Aignan, and dismissed him with a gesture. He rejoined the party\r\noutside the inclosure.\r\n\r\n“You see, madame,” said the captain bitterly to the young woman,--“you\r\nsee your happiness still lasts.”\r\n\r\nThe young woman raised her head with a solemn air. “A day will come,”\r\n said she, “when you will repent of having so misjudged me. On that day,\r\nit is I who will pray God to forgive you for having been unjust towards\r\nme. Besides, I shall suffer so much that you yourself will be the first\r\nto pity my sufferings. Do not reproach me with my fleeting happiness,\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan; it costs me dear, and I have not paid all my debt.”\r\n Saying these words, she again knelt down, softly and affectionately.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me the last time, my affianced Raoul!” said she. “I have\r\nbroken our chain; we are both destined to die of grief. It is thou who\r\ndepartest first; fear nothing, I shall follow thee. See, only, that I\r\nhave not been base, and that I have come to bid thee this last adieu.\r\nThe Lord is my witness, Raoul, that if with my life I could have\r\nredeemed thine, I would have given that life without hesitation. I could\r\nnot give my love. Once more, forgive me, dearest, kindest friend.”\r\n\r\nShe strewed a few sweet flowers on the freshly sodded earth; then,\r\nwiping the tears from her eyes, the heavily stricken lady bowed to\r\nD’Artagnan, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe captain watched the departure of the horses, horsemen, and carriage,\r\nthen crossing his arms upon his swelling chest, “When will it be my turn\r\nto depart?” said he, in an agitated voice. “What is there left for\r\nman after youth, love, glory, friendship, strength, and wealth have\r\ndisappeared? That rock, under which sleeps Porthos, who possessed all I\r\nhave named; this moss, under which repose Athos and Raoul, who possessed\r\nmuch more!”\r\n\r\nHe hesitated for a moment, with a dull eye; then, drawing himself up,\r\n“Forward! still forward!” said he. “When it is time, God will tell me,\r\nas he foretold the others.”\r\n\r\nHe touched the earth, moistened with the evening dew, with the ends\r\nof his fingers, signed himself as if he had been at the _benitier_ in\r\nchurch, and retook alone--ever alone--the road to Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpilogue.\r\n\r\nFour years after the scene we have just described, two horsemen, well\r\nmounted, traversed Blois early in the morning, for the purpose of\r\narranging a hawking party the king had arranged to make in that uneven\r\nplain the Loire divides in two, which borders on the one side Meung, on\r\nthe other Amboise. These were the keeper of the king’s harriers and the\r\nmaster of the falcons, personages greatly respected in the time of\r\nLouis XIII., but rather neglected by his successor. The horsemen, having\r\nreconnoitered the ground, were returning, their observations made, when\r\nthey perceived certain little groups of soldiers, here and there,\r\nwhom the sergeants were placing at distances at the openings of the\r\ninclosures. These were the king’s musketeers. Behind them came, upon a\r\nsplendid horse, the captain, known by his richly embroidered uniform.\r\nHis hair was gray, his beard turning so. He seemed a little bent,\r\nalthough sitting and handling his horse gracefully. He was looking about\r\nhim watchfully.\r\n\r\n“M. d’Artagnan does not get any older,” said the keeper of the harriers\r\nto his colleague the falconer; “with ten years more to carry than either\r\nof us, he has the seat of a young man on horseback.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” replied the falconer. “I don’t see any change in him for\r\nthe last twenty years.”\r\n\r\nBut this officer was mistaken; D’Artagnan in the last four years had\r\nlived a dozen. Age had printed its pitiless claws at each angle of his\r\neyes; his brow was bald; his hands, formerly brown and nervous, were\r\ngetting white, as if the blood had half forgotten them.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan accosted the officers with the shade of affability which\r\ndistinguishes superiors, and received in turn for his courtesy two most\r\nrespectful bows.\r\n\r\n“Ah! what a lucky chance to see you here, Monsieur d’Artagnan!” cried\r\nthe falconer.\r\n\r\n“It is rather I who should say that, messieurs,” replied the captain,\r\n“for nowadays, the king makes more frequent use of his musketeers than\r\nof his falcons.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! it is not as it was in the good old times,” sighed the falconer.\r\n“Do you remember, Monsieur d’Artagnan, when the late king flew the pie\r\nin the vineyards beyond Beaugence? Ah! _dame!_ you were not the captain\r\nof the musketeers at that time, Monsieur d’Artagnan.” [7]\r\n\r\n“And you were nothing but under-corporal of the tiercelets,” replied\r\nD’Artagnan, laughing. “Never mind that, it was a good time, seeing\r\nthat it is always a good time when we are young. Good day, monsieur the\r\nkeeper of the harriers.”\r\n\r\n“You do me honor, monsieur le comte,” said the latter. D’Artagnan made\r\nno reply. The title of comte had hardly struck him; D’Artagnan had been\r\na comte four years.\r\n\r\n“Are you not very much fatigued with the long journey you have taken,\r\nmonsieur le capitaine?” continued the falconer. “It must be full two\r\nhundred leagues from hence to Pignerol.”\r\n\r\n“Two hundred and sixty to go, and as many to return,” said D’Artagnan,\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n“And,” said the falconer, “is _he_ well?”\r\n\r\n“Who?” asked D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Why, poor M. Fouquet,” continued the falconer, in a low voice. The\r\nkeeper of the harriers had prudently withdrawn.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied D’Artagnan, “the poor man frets terribly; he cannot\r\ncomprehend how imprisonment can be a favor; he says that parliament\r\nabsolved him by banishing him, and banishment is, or should be, liberty.\r\nHe cannot imagine that they had sworn his death, and that to save his\r\nlife from the claws of parliament was to be under too much obligation to\r\nHeaven.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! yes; the poor man had a close chance of the scaffold,” replied the\r\nfalconer; “it is said that M. Colbert had given orders to the governor\r\nof the Bastile, and that the execution was ordered.”\r\n\r\n“Enough!” said D’Artagnan, pensively, and with a view of cutting short\r\nthe conversation.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the keeper of the harriers, drawing towards them, “M.\r\nFouquet is now at Pignerol; he has richly deserved it. He had the good\r\nfortune to be conducted there by you; he robbed the king sufficiently.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan launched at the master of the dogs one of his crossest looks,\r\nand said to him, “Monsieur, if any one told me you had eaten your dogs’\r\nmeat, not only would I refuse to believe it; but still more, if you were\r\ncondemned to the lash or to jail for it, I should pity you and would not\r\nallow people to speak ill of you. And yet, monsieur, honest man as you\r\nmay be, I assure you that you are not more so than poor M. Fouquet was.”\r\n\r\nAfter having undergone this sharp rebuke, the keeper of the harriers\r\nhung his head, and allowed the falconer to get two steps in advance of\r\nhim nearer to D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“He is content,” said the falconer, in a low voice, to the musketeer;\r\n“we all know that harriers are in fashion nowadays; if he were a\r\nfalconer he would not talk in that way.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan smiled in a melancholy manner at seeing this great political\r\nquestion resolved by the discontent of such humble interest. He for a\r\nmoment ran over in his mind the glorious existence of the surintendant,\r\nthe crumbling of his fortunes, and the melancholy death that awaited\r\nhim; and to conclude, “Did M. Fouquet love falconry?” said he.\r\n\r\n“Oh, passionately, monsieur!” repeated the falconer, with an accent of\r\nbitter regret and a sigh that was the funeral oration of Fouquet.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan allowed the ill-humor of the one and the regret of the other\r\nto pass, and continued to advance. They could already catch glimpses\r\nof the huntsmen at the issue of the wood, the feathers of the outriders\r\npassing like shooting stars across the clearings, and the white horses\r\nskirting the bosky thickets looking like illuminated apparitions.\r\n\r\n“But,” resumed D’Artagnan, “will the sport last long? Pray, give us a\r\ngood swift bird, for I am very tired. Is it a heron or a swan?”\r\n\r\n“Both, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the falconer; “but you need not be\r\nalarmed; the king is not much of a sportsman; he does not take the field\r\non his own account, he only wishes to amuse the ladies.”\r\n\r\nThe words “to amuse the ladies” were so strongly accented they set\r\nD’Artagnan thinking.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said he, looking keenly at the falconer.\r\n\r\nThe keeper of the harriers smiled, no doubt with a view of making it up\r\nwith the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“Oh! you may safely laugh,” said D’Artagnan; “I know nothing of current\r\nnews; I only arrived yesterday, after a month’s absence. I left the\r\ncourt mourning the death of the queen-mother. The king was not willing\r\nto take any amusement after receiving the last sigh of Anne of Austria;\r\nbut everything comes to an end in this world. Well! then he is no longer\r\nsad? So much the better.” [8]\r\n\r\n“And everything begins as well as ends,” said the keeper with a coarse\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said D’Artagnan, a second time,--he burned to know, but dignity\r\nwould not allow him to interrogate people below him,--“there is\r\nsomething beginning, then, it seems?”\r\n\r\nThe keeper gave him a significant wink; but D’Artagnan was unwilling to\r\nlearn anything from this man.\r\n\r\n“Shall we see the king early?” asked he of the falconer.\r\n\r\n“At seven o’clock, monsieur, I shall fly the birds.”\r\n\r\n“Who comes with the king? How is Madame? How is the queen?”\r\n\r\n“Better, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“Has she been ill, then?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur, since the last chagrin she suffered, her majesty has been\r\nunwell.”\r\n\r\n“What chagrin? You need not fancy your news is old. I have but just\r\nreturned.”\r\n\r\n“It appears that the queen, a little neglected since the death of her\r\nmother-in-law, complained to the king, who answered her,--‘Do I not\r\nsleep at home every night, madame? What more do you expect?’”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said D’Artagnan,--“poor woman! She must heartily hate Mademoiselle\r\nde la Vallière.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! not Mademoiselle de la Vallière,” replied the falconer.\r\n\r\n“Who then--” The blast of a hunting-horn interrupted this conversation.\r\nIt summoned the dogs and the hawks. The falconer and his companions set\r\noff immediately, leaving D’Artagnan alone in the midst of the suspended\r\nsentence. The king appeared at a distance, surrounded by ladies and\r\nhorsemen. All the troop advanced in beautiful order, at a foot’s pace,\r\nthe horns of various sorts animating the dogs and horses. There was an\r\nanimation in the scene, a mirage of light, of which nothing now can give\r\nan idea, unless it be the fictitious splendor of a theatric spectacle.\r\nD’Artagnan, with an eye a little, just a little, dimmed by age,\r\ndistinguished behind the group three carriages. The first was intended\r\nfor the queen; it was empty. D’Artagnan, who did not see Mademoiselle de\r\nla Vallière by the king’s side, on looking about for her, saw her in the\r\nsecond carriage. She was alone with two of her women, who seemed as dull\r\nas their mistress. On the left hand of the king, upon a high-spirited\r\nhorse, restrained by a bold and skillful hand, shone a lady of most\r\ndazzling beauty. The king smiled upon her, and she smiled upon the king.\r\nLoud laughter followed every word she uttered.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I must know that woman,” thought the musketeer; “who can she be?” And\r\nhe stooped towards his friend, the falconer, to whom he addressed the\r\nquestion he had put to himself.\r\n\r\nThe falconer was about to reply, when the king, perceiving D’Artagnan,\r\n“Ah, comte!” said he, “you are amongst us once more then! Why have I not\r\nseen you?”\r\n\r\n“Sire,” replied the captain, “because your majesty was asleep when I\r\narrived, and not awake when I resumed my duties this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Still the same,” said Louis, in a loud voice, denoting satisfaction.\r\n“Take some rest, comte; I command you to do so. You will dine with me\r\nto-day.”\r\n\r\nA murmur of admiration surrounded D’Artagnan like a caress. Every one\r\nwas eager to salute him. Dining with the king was an honor his majesty\r\nwas not so prodigal of as Henry IV. had been. The king passed a few\r\nsteps in advance, and D’Artagnan found himself in the midst of a fresh\r\ngroup, among whom shone Colbert.\r\n\r\n“Good-day, Monsieur d’Artagnan,” said the minister, with marked\r\naffability, “have you had a pleasant journey?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, monsieur,” said D’Artagnan, bowing to the neck of his horse.\r\n\r\n“I heard the king invite you to his table for this evening,” continued\r\nthe minister; “you will meet an old friend there.”\r\n\r\n“An old friend of mine?” asked D’Artagnan, plunging painfully into\r\nthe dark waves of the past, which had swallowed up for him so many\r\nfriendships and so many hatreds.\r\n\r\n“M. le Duc d’Almeda, who is arrived this morning from Spain.”\r\n\r\n“The Duc d’Almeda?” said D’Artagnan, reflecting in vain.\r\n\r\n“Here!” cried an old man, white as snow, sitting bent in his carriage,\r\nwhich he caused to be thrown open to make room for the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“_Aramis!_” cried D’Artagnan, struck with profound amazement. And he\r\nfelt, inert as it was, the thin arm of the old nobleman hanging round\r\nhis neck.\r\n\r\nColbert, after having observed them in silence for a few moments, urged\r\nhis horse forward, and left the two old friends together.\r\n\r\n“And so,” said the musketeer, taking Aramis’s arm, “you, the exile, the\r\nrebel, are again in France?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! and I shall dine with you at the king’s table,” said Aramis,\r\nsmiling. “Yes, will you not ask yourself what is the use of fidelity\r\nin this world? Stop! let us allow poor La Vallière’s carriage to pass.\r\nLook, how uneasy she is! How her eyes, dim with tears, follow the king,\r\nwho is riding on horseback yonder!”\r\n\r\n“With whom?”\r\n\r\n“With Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, now Madame de Montespan,” replied\r\nAramis.\r\n\r\n“She is jealous. Is she then deserted?”\r\n\r\n“Not quite yet, but it will not be long before she _is_.” [9]\r\n\r\nThey chatted together, while following the sport, and Aramis’s coachman\r\ndrove them so cleverly that they arrived at the instant when the falcon,\r\nattacking the bird, beat him down, and fell upon him. The king alighted;\r\nMadame de Montespan followed his example. They were in front of an\r\nisolated chapel, concealed by huge trees, already despoiled of their\r\nleaves by the first cutting winds of autumn. Behind this chapel was an\r\ninclosure, closed by a latticed gate. The falcon had beaten down his\r\nprey in the inclosure belonging to this little chapel, and the king was\r\ndesirous of going in to take the first feather, according to custom. The\r\n_cortege_ formed a circle round the building and the hedges, too small\r\nto receive so many. D’Artagnan held back Aramis by the arm, as he was\r\nabout, like the rest, to alight from his carriage, and in a hoarse,\r\nbroken voice, “Do you know, Aramis,” said he, “whither chance has\r\nconducted us?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the duke.\r\n\r\n“Here repose men that we knew well,” said D’Artagnan, greatly agitated.\r\n\r\nAramis, without divining anything, and with a trembling step, penetrated\r\ninto the chapel by a little door which D’Artagnan opened for him. “Where\r\nare they buried?” said he.\r\n\r\n“There, in the inclosure. There is a cross, you see, beneath yon little\r\ncypress. The tree of grief is planted over their tomb; don’t go to it;\r\nthe king is going that way; the heron has fallen just there.”\r\n\r\nAramis stopped, and concealed himself in the shade. They then saw,\r\nwithout being seen, the pale face of La Vallière, who, neglected in her\r\ncarriage, at first looked on, with a melancholy heart, from the door,\r\nand then, carried away by jealousy, advanced into the chapel, whence,\r\nleaning against a pillar, she contemplated the king smiling and making\r\nsigns to Madame de Montespan to approach, as there was nothing to be\r\nafraid of. Madame de Montespan complied; she took the hand the king held\r\nout to her, and he, plucking out the first feather from the heron, which\r\nthe falconer had strangled, placed it in his beautiful companion’s hat.\r\nShe, smiling in her turn, kissed the hand tenderly which made her this\r\npresent. The king grew scarlet with vanity and pleasure; he looked at\r\nMadame de Montespan with all the fire of new love.\r\n\r\n“What will you give me in exchange?” said he.\r\n\r\nShe broke off a little branch of cypress and offered it to the king, who\r\nlooked intoxicated with hope.\r\n\r\n“Humph!” said Aramis to D’Artagnan; “the present is but a sad one, for\r\nthat cypress shades a tomb.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and the tomb is that of Raoul de Bragelonne,” said D’Artagnan\r\naloud; “of Raoul, who sleeps under that cross with his father.”\r\n\r\nA groan resounded--they saw a woman fall fainting to the ground.\r\nMademoiselle de la Vallière had seen all, heard all.\r\n\r\n“Poor woman!” muttered D’Artagnan, as he helped the attendants to carry\r\nback to her carriage the lonely lady whose lot henceforth in life was\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nThat evening D’Artagnan was seated at the king’s table, near M. Colbert\r\nand M. le Duc d’Almeda. The king was very gay. He paid a thousand little\r\nattentions to the queen, a thousand kindnesses to Madame, seated at his\r\nleft hand, and very sad. It might have been supposed that time of calm\r\nwhen the king was wont to watch his mother’s eyes for the approval or\r\ndisapproval of what he had just done.\r\n\r\nOf mistresses there was no question at this dinner. The king addressed\r\nAramis two or three times, calling him M. l’ambassadeur, which increased\r\nthe surprise already felt by D’Artagnan at seeing his friend the rebel\r\nso marvelously well received at court.\r\n\r\nThe king, on rising from table, gave his hand to the queen, and made\r\na sign to Colbert, whose eye was on his master’s face. Colbert took\r\nD’Artagnan and Aramis on one side. The king began to chat with his\r\nsister, whilst Monsieur, very uneasy, entertained the queen with a\r\npreoccupied air, without ceasing to watch his wife and brother from\r\nthe corner of his eye. The conversation between Aramis, D’Artagnan,\r\nand Colbert turned upon indifferent subjects. They spoke of preceding\r\nministers; Colbert related the successful tricks of Mazarin, and desired\r\nthose of Richelieu to be related to him. D’Artagnan could not overcome\r\nhis surprise at finding this man, with his heavy eyebrows and low\r\nforehead, display so much sound knowledge and cheerful spirits. Aramis\r\nwas astonished at that lightness of character which permitted this\r\nserious man to retard with advantage the moment for more important\r\nconversation, to which nobody made any allusion, although all\r\nthree interlocutors felt its imminence. It was very plain, from the\r\nembarrassed appearance of Monsieur, how much the conversation of the\r\nking and Madame annoyed him. Madame’s eyes were almost red: was she\r\ngoing to complain? Was she going to expose a little scandal in open\r\ncourt? The king took her on one side, and in a tone so tender that\r\nit must have reminded the princess of the time when she was loved for\r\nherself:\r\n\r\n“Sister,” said he, “why do I see tears in those lovely eyes?”\r\n\r\n“Why--sire--” said she.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur is jealous, is he not, sister?”\r\n\r\nShe looked towards Monsieur, an infallible sign that they were talking\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said she.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me,” said the king; “if your friends compromise you, it is\r\nnot Monsieur’s fault.”\r\n\r\nHe spoke these words with so much kindness that Madame, encouraged,\r\nhaving borne so many solitary griefs so long, was nearly bursting into\r\ntears, so full was her heart.\r\n\r\n“Come, come, dear little sister,” said the king, “tell me your griefs;\r\non the word of a brother, I pity them; on the word of a king, I will put\r\nan end to them.”\r\n\r\nShe raised her glorious eyes and, in a melancholy tone:\r\n\r\n“It is not my friends who compromise me,” said she; “they are either\r\nabsent or concealed; they have been brought into disgrace with your\r\nmajesty; they, so devoted, so good, so loyal!”\r\n\r\n“You say this on account of De Guiche, whom I have exiled, at Monsieur’s\r\ndesire?”\r\n\r\n“And who, since that unjust exile, has endeavored to get himself killed\r\nonce every day.”\r\n\r\n“Unjust, say you, sister?”\r\n\r\n“So unjust, that if I had not had the respect mixed with friendship that\r\nI have always entertained for your majesty--”\r\n\r\n“Well!”\r\n\r\n“Well! I would have asked my brother Charles, upon whom I can always--”\r\n\r\nThe king started. “What, then?”\r\n\r\n“I would have asked him to have had it represented to you that Monsieur\r\nand his favorite M. le Chevalier de Lorraine ought not with impunity to\r\nconstitute themselves the executioners of my honor and my happiness.”\r\n\r\n“The Chevalier de Lorraine,” said the king; “that dismal fellow?”\r\n\r\n“Is my mortal enemy. Whilst that man lives in my household, where\r\nMonsieur retains him and delegates his power to him, I shall be the most\r\nmiserable woman in the kingdom.”\r\n\r\n“So,” said the king, slowly, “you call your brother of England a better\r\nfriend than I am?”\r\n\r\n“Actions speak for themselves, sire.”\r\n\r\n“And you would prefer going to ask assistance there--”\r\n\r\n“To my own country!” said she with pride; “yes, sire.”\r\n\r\n“You are the grandchild of Henry IV. as well as myself, lady. Cousin\r\nand brother-in-law, does not that amount pretty well to the title of\r\nbrother-germain?”\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Henrietta, “act!”\r\n\r\n“Let us form an alliance.”\r\n\r\n“Begin.”\r\n\r\n“I have, you say, unjustly exiled De Guiche.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! yes,” said she, blushing.\r\n\r\n“De Guiche shall return.” [10]\r\n\r\n“So far, well.”\r\n\r\n“And now you say that I do wrong in having in your household the\r\nChevalier de Lorraine, who gives Monsieur ill advice respecting you?”\r\n\r\n“Remember well what I tell you, sire; the Chevalier de Lorraine some\r\nday--Observe, if ever I come to a dreadful end, I beforehand accuse the\r\nChevalier de Lorraine; he has a spirit that is capable of any crime!”\r\n\r\n“The Chevalier de Lorraine shall no longer annoy you--I promise you\r\nthat.” [11]\r\n\r\n“Then that will be a true preliminary of alliance, sire,--I sign; but\r\nsince you have done your part, tell me what shall be mine.”\r\n\r\n“Instead of embroiling me with your brother Charles, you must make him a\r\nmore intimate friend than ever.”\r\n\r\n“That is very easy.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! not quite so easy as you may suppose, for in ordinary friendship\r\npeople embrace or exercise hospitality, and that only costs a kiss or a\r\nreturn, profitable expenses; but in political friendship--”\r\n\r\n“Ah! it’s a political friendship, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my sister; and then, instead of embraces and feasts, it is\r\nsoldiers--it is soldiers all alive and well equipped--that we must serve\r\nup to our friends; vessels we must offer, all armed with cannons and\r\nstored with provisions. It hence results that we have not always coffers\r\nin a fit condition for such friendships.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you are quite right,” said Madame; “the coffers of the king of\r\nEngland have been sonorous for some time.”\r\n\r\n“But you, my sister, who have so much influence over your brother, you\r\ncan secure more than an ambassador could ever get the promise of.”\r\n\r\n“To effect that I must go to London, my dear brother.”\r\n\r\n“I have thought so,” replied the king, eagerly; “and I have said to\r\nmyself that such a voyage would do your health and spirits good.”\r\n\r\n“Only,” interrupted Madame, “it is possible I should fail. The king of\r\nEngland has dangerous counselors.”\r\n\r\n“Counselors, do you say?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely. If, by chance, your majesty had any intention--I am only\r\nsupposing so--of asking Charles II. his alliance in a war--”\r\n\r\n“A war?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; well! then the king’s counselors, who are in number\r\nseven--Mademoiselle Stewart, Mademoiselle Wells, Mademoiselle Gwyn,\r\nMiss Orchay, Mademoiselle Zunga, Miss Davies, and the proud Countess of\r\nCastlemaine--will represent to the king that war costs a great deal of\r\nmoney; that it is better to give balls and suppers at Hampton Court than\r\nto equip ships of the line at Portsmouth and Greenwich.”\r\n\r\n“And then your negotiations will fail?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! those ladies cause all negotiations to fall through which they\r\ndon’t make themselves.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know the idea that has struck me, sister?”\r\n\r\n“No; inform me what it is.”\r\n\r\n“It is that, searching well around you, you might perhaps find a female\r\ncounselor to take with you to your brother, whose eloquence might\r\nparalyze the ill-will of the seven others.”\r\n\r\n“That is really an idea, sire, and I will search.”\r\n\r\n“You will find what you want.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so.”\r\n\r\n“A pretty ambassadress is necessary; an agreeable face is better than an\r\nugly one, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly.”\r\n\r\n“An animated, lively, audacious character.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Nobility; that is, enough to enable her to approach the king without\r\nawkwardness--not too lofty, so as not to trouble herself about the\r\ndignity of her race.”\r\n\r\n“Very true.”\r\n\r\n“And who knows a little English.”\r\n\r\n“_Mon Dieu!_ why, some one,” cried Madame, “like Mademoiselle de\r\nKeroualle, for instance!”\r\n\r\n“Oh! why, yes!” said Louis XIV.; “you have hit the mark,--it is you who\r\nhave found, my sister.”\r\n\r\n“I will take her; she will have no cause to complain, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! no, I will name her _seductrice plenipotentiaire_ at once, and will\r\nadd a dowry to the title.”\r\n\r\n“That is well.”\r\n\r\n“I fancy you already on your road, my dear little sister, consoled for\r\nall your griefs.”\r\n\r\n“I will go, on two conditions. The first is, that I shall know what I am\r\nnegotiating about.”\r\n\r\n“That is it. The Dutch, you know, insult me daily in their gazettes, and\r\nby their republican attitude. I do not like republics.”\r\n\r\n“That may easily be imagined, sire.”\r\n\r\n“I see with pain that these kings of the sea--they call themselves\r\nso--keep trade from France in the Indies, and that their vessels will\r\nsoon occupy all the ports of Europe. Such a power is too near me,\r\nsister.”\r\n\r\n“They are your allies, nevertheless.”\r\n\r\n“That is why they were wrong in having the medal you have heard of\r\nstruck; a medal which represents Holland stopping the sun, as Joshua\r\ndid, with this legend: _The sun had stopped before me_. There is not\r\nmuch fraternity in that, _is_ there?”\r\n\r\n“I thought you had forgotten that miserable episode?”\r\n\r\n“I never forget anything, sister. And if my true friends, such as your\r\nbrother Charles, are willing to second me--” The princess remained\r\npensively silent.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me; there is the empire of the seas to be shared,” said\r\nLouis XIV. “For this partition, which England submits to, could I not\r\nrepresent the second party as well as the Dutch?”\r\n\r\n“We have Mademoiselle de Keroualle to treat that question,” replied\r\nMadame.\r\n\r\n“Your second condition for going, if you please, sister?”\r\n\r\n“The consent of Monsieur, my husband.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have it.”\r\n\r\n“Then consider me already gone, brother.”\r\n\r\nOn hearing these words, Louis XIV. turned round towards the corner of\r\nthe room in which D’Artagnan, Colbert, and Aramis stood, and made\r\nan affirmative sign to his minister. Colbert then broke in on the\r\nconversation suddenly, and said to Aramis:\r\n\r\n“Monsieur l’ambassadeur, shall we talk about business?”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan immediately withdrew, from politeness. He directed his steps\r\ntowards the fireplace, within hearing of what the king was about to say\r\nto Monsieur, who, evidently uneasy, had gone to him. The face of the\r\nking was animated. Upon his brow was stamped a strength of will, the\r\nexpression of which already met no further contradiction in France, and\r\nwas soon to meet no more in Europe.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said the king to his brother, “I am not pleased with M. le\r\nChevalier de Lorraine. You, who do him the honor to protect him, must\r\nadvise him to travel for a few months.”\r\n\r\nThese words fell with the crush of an avalanche upon Monsieur, who\r\nadored his favorite, and concentrated all his affections in him.\r\n\r\n“In what has the chevalier been inconsiderate enough to displease your\r\nmajesty?” cried he, darting a furious look at Madame.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you that when he is gone,” said the king, suavely. “And\r\nalso when Madame, here, shall have crossed over into England.”\r\n\r\n“Madame! in England!” murmured Monsieur, in amazement.\r\n\r\n“In a week, brother,” continued the king, “whilst we will go whither I\r\nwill shortly tell you.” And the king turned on his heel, smiling in his\r\nbrother’s face, to sweeten, as it were, the bitter draught he had given\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Colbert was talking with the Duc d’Almeda.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said Colbert to Aramis, “this is the moment for us to come\r\nto an understanding. I have made your peace with the king, and I owed\r\nthat clearly to a man of so much merit; but as you have often expressed\r\nfriendship for me, an opportunity presents itself for giving me a proof\r\nof it. You are, besides, more a Frenchman than a Spaniard. Shall we\r\nsecure--answer me frankly--the neutrality of Spain, if we undertake\r\nanything against the United Provinces?”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” replied Aramis, “the interest of Spain is clear. To embroil\r\nEurope with the Provinces would doubtless be our policy, but the king\r\nof France is an ally of the United Provinces. You are not ignorant,\r\nbesides, that it would infer a maritime war, and that France is in no\r\nstate to undertake this with advantage.”\r\n\r\nColbert, turning round at this moment, saw D’Artagnan who was seeking\r\nsome interlocutor, during this “aside” of the king and Monsieur. He\r\ncalled him, at the same time saying in a low voice to Aramis, “We may\r\ntalk openly with D’Artagnan, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! certainly,” replied the ambassador.\r\n\r\n“We were saying, M. d’Almeda and I,” said Colbert, “that a conflict with\r\nthe United Provinces would mean a maritime war.”\r\n\r\n“That’s evident enough,” replied the musketeer.\r\n\r\n“And what do you think of it, Monsieur d’Artagnan?”\r\n\r\n“I think that to carry on such a war successfully, you must have very\r\nlarge land forces.”\r\n\r\n“What did you say?” said Colbert, thinking he had ill understood him.\r\n\r\n“Why such a large land army?” said Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Because the king will be beaten by sea if he has not the English with\r\nhim, and that when beaten by sea, he will soon be invaded, either by the\r\nDutch in his ports, or by the Spaniards by land.”\r\n\r\n“And Spain neutral?” asked Aramis.\r\n\r\n“Neutral as long as the king shall prove stronger,” rejoined D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nColbert admired that sagacity which never touched a question without\r\nenlightening it thoroughly. Aramis smiled, as he had long known that in\r\ndiplomacy D’Artagnan acknowledged no superior. Colbert, who, like all\r\nproud men, dwelt upon his fantasy with a certainty of success, resumed\r\nthe subject, “Who told you, M. d’Artagnan, that the king had no navy?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I take no heed of these details,” replied the captain. “I am but an\r\nindifferent sailor. Like all nervous people, I hate the sea; and yet I\r\nhave an idea that, with ships, France being a seaport with two hundred\r\nexits, we might have sailors.”\r\n\r\nColbert drew from his pocket a little oblong book divided into two\r\ncolumns. On the first were the names of vessels, on the other the\r\nfigures recapitulating the number of cannon and men requisite to equip\r\nthese ships. “I have had the same idea as you,” said he to\r\nD’Artagnan, “and I have had an account drawn up of the vessels we have\r\naltogether--thirty-five ships.”\r\n\r\n“Thirty-five ships! impossible!” cried D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Something like two thousand pieces of cannon,” said Colbert. “That is\r\nwhat the king possesses at this moment. Of five and thirty vessels we\r\ncan make three squadrons, but I must have five.”\r\n\r\n“Five!” cried Aramis.\r\n\r\n“They will be afloat before the end of the year, gentlemen; the king\r\nwill have fifty ship of the line. We may venture on a contest with them,\r\nmay we not?”\r\n\r\n“To build vessels,” said D’Artagnan, “is difficult, but possible. As\r\nto arming them, how is that to be done? In France there are neither\r\nfoundries nor military docks.”\r\n\r\n“Bah!” replied Colbert, in a bantering tone, “I have planned all\r\nthat this year and a half past, did you not know it? Do you know M.\r\nd’Imfreville?”\r\n\r\n“D’Imfreville?” replied D’Artagnan; “no.”\r\n\r\n“He is a man I have discovered; he has a specialty; he is a man of\r\ngenius--he knows how to set men to work. It is he who has cast cannon\r\nand cut the woods of Bourgogne. And then, monsieur l’ambassadeur, you\r\nmay not believe what I am going to tell you, but I have a still further\r\nidea.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, monsieur!” said Aramis, civilly, “I always believe you.”\r\n\r\n“Calculating upon the character of the Dutch, our allies, I said to\r\nmyself, ‘They are merchants, they are friendly with the king; they will\r\nbe happy to sell to the king what they fabricate for themselves; then\r\nthe more we buy’--Ah! I must add this: I have Forant--do you know\r\nForant, D’Artagnan?”\r\n\r\nColbert, in his warmth, forgot himself; he called the captain simply\r\n_D’Artagnan_, as the king did. But the captain only smiled at it.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied he, “I do not know him.”\r\n\r\n“That is another man I have discovered, with a genius for buying. This\r\nForant has purchased for me 350,000 pounds of iron in balls, 200,000\r\npounds of powder, twelve cargoes of Northern timber, matches, grenades,\r\npitch, tar--I know not what! with a saving of seven per cent upon what\r\nall those articles would cost me fabricated in France.”\r\n\r\n“That is a capital and quaint idea,” replied D’Artagnan, “to have Dutch\r\ncannon-balls cast which will return to the Dutch.”\r\n\r\n“Is it not, with loss, too?” And Colbert laughed aloud. He was delighted\r\nwith his own joke.\r\n\r\n“Still further,” added he, “these same Dutch are building for the king,\r\nat this moment, six vessels after the model of the best of their name.\r\nDestouches--Ah! perhaps you don’t know Destouches?”\r\n\r\n“No, monsieur.”\r\n\r\n“He is a man who has a sure glance to discern, when a ship is launched,\r\nwhat are the defects and qualities of that ship--that is valuable,\r\nobserve! Nature is truly whimsical. Well, this Destouches appeared to\r\nme to be a man likely to prove useful in marine affairs, and he is\r\nsuperintending the construction of six vessels of seventy-eight guns,\r\nwhich the Provinces are building for his majesty. It results from this,\r\nmy dear Monsieur d’Artagnan, that the king, if he wished to quarrel with\r\nthe Provinces, would have a very pretty fleet. Now, you know better than\r\nanybody else if the land army is efficient.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan and Aramis looked at each other, wondering at the mysterious\r\nlabors this man had undertaken in so short a time. Colbert understood\r\nthem, and was touched by this best of flatteries.\r\n\r\n“If we, in France, were ignorant of what was going on,” said D’Artagnan,\r\n“out of France still less must be known.”\r\n\r\n“That is why I told monsieur l’ambassadeur,” said Colbert, “that, Spain\r\npromising its neutrality, England helping us--”\r\n\r\n“If England assists you,” said Aramis, “I promise the neutrality of\r\nSpain.”\r\n\r\n“I take you at your word,” Colbert hastened to reply with his blunt\r\n_bonhomie_. “And, _a propos_ of Spain, you have not the ‘Golden Fleece,’\r\nMonsieur d’Almeda. I heard the king say the other day that he should\r\nlike to see you wear the _grand cordon_ of St. Michael.”\r\n\r\nAramis bowed. “Oh!” thought D’Artagnan, “and Porthos is no longer here!\r\nWhat ells of ribbons would there be for him in these _largesses!_ Dear\r\nPorthos!”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur d’Artagnan,” resumed Colbert, “between us two, you will have,\r\nI wager, an inclination to lead your musketeers into Holland. Can you\r\nswim?” And he laughed like a man in high good humor.\r\n\r\n“Like an eel,” replied D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Ah! but there are some bitter passages of canals and marshes yonder,\r\nMonsieur d’Artagnan, and the best swimmers are sometimes drowned there.”\r\n\r\n“It is my profession to die for his majesty,” said the musketeer. “Only,\r\nas it is seldom in war that much water is met with without a little\r\nfire, I declare to you beforehand, that I will do my best to choose\r\nfire. I am getting old; water freezes me--but fire warms, Monsieur\r\nColbert.”\r\n\r\nAnd D’Artagnan looked so handsome still in quasi-juvenile strength as\r\nhe pronounced these words, that Colbert, in his turn, could not help\r\nadmiring him. D’Artagnan perceived the effect he had produced. He\r\nremembered that the best tradesman is he who fixes a high price upon his\r\ngoods, when they are valuable. He prepared his price in advance.\r\n\r\n“So, then,” said Colbert, “we go into Holland?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied D’Artagnan; “only--”\r\n\r\n“Only?” said M. Colbert.\r\n\r\n“Only,” repeated D’Artagnan, “there lurks in everything the question of\r\ninterest, the question of self-love. It is a very fine title, that of\r\ncaptain of the musketeers; but observe this: we have now the king’s\r\nguards and the military household of the king. A captain of musketeers\r\nought to command all that, and then he would absorb a hundred thousand\r\nlivres a year for expenses.”\r\n\r\n“Well! but do you suppose the king would haggle with you?” said Colbert.\r\n\r\n“Eh! monsieur, you have not understood me,” replied D’Artagnan, sure of\r\ncarrying his point. “I was telling you that I, an old captain, formerly\r\nchief of the king’s guard, having precedence of the _marechaux_ of\r\nFrance--I saw myself one day in the trenches with two other equals, the\r\ncaptain of the guards and the colonel commanding the Swiss. Now, at no\r\nprice will I suffer that. I have old habits, and I will stand or fall by\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nColbert felt this blow, but he was prepared for it.\r\n\r\n“I have been thinking of what you said just now,” replied he.\r\n\r\n“About what, monsieur?”\r\n\r\n“We were speaking of canals and marshes in which people are drowned.”\r\n\r\n“Well!”\r\n\r\n“Well! if they are drowned, it is for want of a boat, a plank, or a\r\nstick.”\r\n\r\n“Of a stick, however short it may be,” said D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said Colbert. “And, therefore, I never heard of an instance\r\nof a _marechal_ of France being drowned.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan became very pale with joy, and in a not very firm voice,\r\n“People would be very proud of me in my country,” said he, “if I were\r\na _marechal_ of France; but a man must have commanded an expedition in\r\nchief to obtain the _baton_.”\r\n\r\n“Monsieur!” said Colbert, “here is in this pocket-book which you will\r\nstudy, a plan of campaign you will have to lead a body of troops to\r\ncarry out in the next spring.” [12]\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan took the book, tremblingly, and his fingers meeting those of\r\nColbert, the minister pressed the hand of the musketeer loyally.\r\n\r\n“Monsieur,” said he, “we had both a revenge to take, one over the other.\r\nI have begun; it is now your turn!”\r\n\r\n“I will do you justice, monsieur,” replied D’Artagnan, “and implore you\r\nto tell the king that the first opportunity that shall offer, he may\r\ndepend upon a victory, or to behold me dead--_or both_.”\r\n\r\n“Then I will have the _fleurs-de-lis_ for your _marechal’s baton_\r\nprepared immediately,” said Colbert.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, Aramis, who was setting out for Madrid, to negotiate the\r\nneutrality of Spain, came to embrace D’Artagnan at his hotel.\r\n\r\n“Let us love each other for four,” said D’Artagnan. “We are now but\r\ntwo.”\r\n\r\n“And you will, perhaps, never see me again, dear D’Artagnan,” said\r\nAramis; “if you knew how I have loved you! I am old, I am extinct--ah, I\r\nam almost dead.”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” said D’Artagnan, “you will live longer than I shall:\r\ndiplomacy commands you to live; but, for my part, honor condemns me to\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! such men as we are, monsieur le marechal,” said Aramis, “only die\r\nsatisfied with joy in glory.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” replied D’Artagnan, with a melancholy smile, “I assure you,\r\nmonsieur le duc, I feel very little appetite for either.”\r\n\r\nThey once more embraced, and, two hours after, separated--forever.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of D’Artagnan.\r\n\r\nContrary to that which generally happens, whether in politics or morals,\r\neach kept his promises, and did honor to his engagements.\r\n\r\nThe king recalled M. de Guiche, and banished M. le Chevalier de\r\nLorraine; so that Monsieur became ill in consequence. Madame set out\r\nfor London, where she applied herself so earnestly to make her brother,\r\nCharles II., acquire a taste for the political counsels of Mademoiselle\r\nde Keroualle, that the alliance between England and France was signed,\r\nand the English vessels, ballasted by a few millions of French gold,\r\nmade a terrible campaign against the fleets of the United Provinces.\r\nCharles II. had promised Mademoiselle de Keroualle a little gratitude\r\nfor her good counsels; he made her Duchess of Portsmouth. Colbert had\r\npromised the king vessels, munitions, victories. He kept his word, as\r\nis well known. At length Aramis, upon whose promises there was least\r\ndependence to be placed, wrote Colbert the following letter, on the\r\nsubject of the negotiations which he had undertaken at Madrid:\r\n\r\n“MONSIEUR COLBERT,--I have the honor to expedite to you the R. P. Oliva,\r\ngeneral _ad interim_ of the Society of Jesus, my provisional successor.\r\nThe reverend father will explain to you, Monsieur Colbert, that I\r\npreserve to myself the direction of all the affairs of the order which\r\nconcern France and Spain; but that I am not willing to retain the title\r\nof general, which would throw too high a side-light on the progress of\r\nthe negotiations with which His Catholic Majesty wishes to intrust me. I\r\nshall resume that title by the command of his majesty, when the labors I\r\nhave undertaken in concert with you, for the great glory of God and His\r\nChurch, shall be brought to a good end. The R. P. Oliva will inform you\r\nlikewise, monsieur, of the consent His Catholic Majesty gives to the\r\nsignature of a treaty which assures the neutrality of Spain in the event\r\nof a war between France and the United Provinces. This consent will be\r\nvalid even if England, instead of being active, should satisfy herself\r\nwith remaining neutral. As for Portugal, of which you and I have spoken,\r\nmonsieur, I can assure you it will contribute with all its resources to\r\nassist the Most Christian King in his war. I beg you, Monsieur\r\nColbert, to preserve your friendship and also to believe in my profound\r\nattachment, and to lay my respect at the feet of His Most Christian\r\nMajesty. Signed,\r\n\r\n“LE DUC D’ALMEDA.” [13]\r\n\r\n\r\nAramis had performed more than he had promised; it remained to be seen\r\nhow the king, M. Colbert, and D’Artagnan would be faithful to each\r\nother. In the spring, as Colbert had predicted, the land army entered\r\non its campaign. It preceded, in magnificent order, the court of Louis\r\nXIV., who, setting out on horseback, surrounded by carriages filled\r\nwith ladies and courtiers, conducted the _elite_ of his kingdom to this\r\nsanguinary _fete_. The officers of the army, it is true, had no other\r\nmusic save the artillery of the Dutch forts; but it was enough for a\r\ngreat number, who found in this war honor, advancement, fortune--or\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nM. d’Artagnan set out commanding a body of twelve thousand men, cavalry,\r\nand infantry, with which he was ordered to take the different places\r\nwhich form knots of that strategic network called La Frise. Never was an\r\narmy conducted more gallantly to an expedition. The officers knew that\r\ntheir leader, prudent and skillful as he was brave, would not sacrifice\r\na single man, nor yield an inch of ground without necessity. He had\r\nthe old habits of war, to live upon the country, keeping his soldiers\r\nsinging and the enemy weeping. The captain of the king’s musketeers\r\nwell knew his business. Never were opportunities better chosen,\r\n_coups-de-main_ better supported, errors of the besieged more quickly\r\ntaken advantage of.\r\n\r\nThe army commanded by D’Artagnan took twelve small places within a\r\nmonth. He was engaged in besieging the thirteenth, which had held out\r\nfive days. D’Artagnan caused the trenches to be opened without appearing\r\nto suppose that these people would ever allow themselves to be taken.\r\nThe pioneers and laborers were, in the army of this man, a body full of\r\nideas and zeal, because their commander treated them like soldiers, knew\r\nhow to render their work glorious, and never allowed them to be killed\r\nif he could help it. It should have been seen with what eagerness the\r\nmarshy glebes of Holland were turned over. Those turf-heaps, mounds of\r\npotter’s clay, melted at the word of the soldiers like butter in the\r\nfrying-pans of Friesland housewives.\r\n\r\nM. d’Artagnan dispatched a courier to the king to give him an account of\r\nthe last success, which redoubled the good humor of his majesty and his\r\ninclination to amuse the ladies. These victories of M. d’Artagnan gave\r\nso much majesty to the prince, that Madame de Montespan no longer\r\ncalled him anything but Louis the Invincible. So that Mademoiselle de\r\nla Vallière, who only called the king Louis the Victorious, lost much\r\nof his majesty’s favor. Besides, her eyes were frequently red, and to an\r\nInvincible nothing is more disagreeable than a mistress who weeps while\r\neverything is smiling round her. The star of Mademoiselle de la Vallière\r\nwas being drowned in clouds and tears. But the gayety of Madame de\r\nMontespan redoubled with the successes of the king, and consoled him for\r\nevery other unpleasant circumstance. It was to D’Artagnan the king owed\r\nthis; and his majesty was anxious to acknowledge these services; he\r\nwrote to M. Colbert:\r\n\r\n“MONSIEUR COLBERT,--We have a promise to fulfil with M. d’Artagnan,\r\nwho so well keeps his. This is to inform you that the time is come for\r\nperforming it. All provisions for this purpose you shall be furnished\r\nwith in due time. LOUIS.”\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this, Colbert, detaining D’Artagnan’s envoy, placed in\r\nthe hands of that messenger a letter from himself, and a small coffer\r\nof ebony inlaid with gold, not very important in appearance, but which,\r\nwithout doubt, was very heavy, as a guard of five men was given to the\r\nmessenger, to assist him in carrying it. These people arrived before\r\nthe place which D’Artagnan was besieging towards daybreak, and presented\r\nthemselves at the lodgings of the general. They were told that M.\r\nd’Artagnan, annoyed by a sortie which the governor, an artful man, had\r\nmade the evening before, and in which the works had been destroyed and\r\nseventy-seven men killed, and the reparation of the breaches commenced,\r\nhad just gone with twenty companies of grenadiers to reconstruct the\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nM. Colbert’s envoy had orders to go and seek M. d’Artagnan, wherever\r\nhe might be, or at whatever hour of the day or night. He directed his\r\ncourse, therefore, towards the trenches, followed by his escort, all\r\non horseback. They perceived M. d’Artagnan in the open plain, with his\r\ngold-laced hat, his long cane, and gilt cuffs. He was biting his white\r\nmustache, and wiping off, with his left hand, the dust which the passing\r\nballs threw up from the ground they plowed so near him. They also saw,\r\namidst this terrible fire, which filled the air with whistling hisses,\r\nofficers handling the shovel, soldiers rolling barrows, and vast\r\nfascines, rising by being either carried or dragged by from ten to\r\ntwenty men, cover the front of the trench reopened to the center by this\r\nextraordinary effort of the general. In three hours, all was reinstated.\r\nD’Artagnan began to speak more mildly; and he became quite calm when the\r\ncaptain of the pioneers approached him, hat in hand, to tell him that\r\nthe trench was again in proper order. This man had scarcely finished\r\nspeaking, when a ball took off one of his legs, and he fell into the\r\narms of D’Artagnan. The latter lifted up his soldier, and quietly, with\r\nsoothing words, carried him into the trench, amidst the enthusiastic\r\napplause of the regiments. From that time it was no longer a question of\r\nvalor--the army was delirious; two companies stole away to the advanced\r\nposts, which they instantly destroyed.\r\n\r\nWhen their comrades, restrained with great difficulty by D’Artagnan, saw\r\nthem lodged upon the bastions, they rushed forward likewise; and soon a\r\nfurious assault was made upon the counterscarp, upon which depended the\r\nsafety of the place. D’Artagnan perceived there was only one means left\r\nof checking his army--to take the place. He directed all his force to\r\nthe two breaches, where the besieged were busy in repairing. The shock\r\nwas terrible; eighteen companies took part in it, and D’Artagnan went\r\nwith the rest, within half cannon-shot of the place, to support the\r\nattack by _echelons_. The cries of the Dutch, who were being poniarded\r\nupon their guns by D’Artagnan’s grenadiers, were distinctly audible. The\r\nstruggle grew fiercer with the despair of the governor, who disputed his\r\nposition foot by foot. D’Artagnan, to put an end to the affair, and\r\nto silence the fire, which was unceasing, sent a fresh column, which\r\npenetrated like a very wedge; and he soon perceived upon the ramparts,\r\nthrough the fire, the terrified flight of the besieged, pursued by the\r\nbesiegers.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the general, breathing feely and full of joy, heard a\r\nvoice behind him, saying, “Monsieur, if you please, from M. Colbert.”\r\n\r\nHe broke the seal of the letter, which contained these words:\r\n\r\n“MONSIEUR D’ARTAGNAN:--The king commands me to inform you that he has\r\nnominated you marechal of France, as a reward for your magnificent\r\nservices, and the honor you do to his arms. The king is highly\r\npleased, monsieur, with the captures you have made; he commands you, in\r\nparticular, to finish the siege you have commenced, with good fortune to\r\nyou, and success for him.”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan was standing with a radiant countenance and sparkling eye.\r\nHe looked up to watch the progress of his troops upon the walls, still\r\nenveloped in red and black volumes of smoke. “I have finished,” replied\r\nhe to the messenger; “the city will have surrendered in a quarter of an\r\nhour.” He then resumed his reading:\r\n\r\n“The _coffret_, Monsieur d’Artagnan, is my own present. You will not be\r\nsorry to see that, whilst you warriors are drawing the sword to defend\r\nthe king, I am moving the pacific arts to ornament a present worthy of\r\nyou. I commend myself to your friendship, monsieur le marechal, and beg\r\nyou to believe in mine. COLBERT”\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan, intoxicated with joy, made a sign to the messenger, who\r\napproached, with his _coffret_ in his hands. But at the moment the\r\n_marechal_ was going to look at it, a loud explosion resounded from the\r\nramparts, and called his attention towards the city. “It is strange,”\r\n said D’Artagnan, “that I don’t yet see the king’s flag on the walls, or\r\nhear the drums beat the _chamade_.” He launched three hundred fresh men,\r\nunder a high-spirited officer, and ordered another breach to be made.\r\nThen, more tranquilly, he turned towards the _coffret_, which Colbert’s\r\nenvoy held out to him.--It was his treasure--he had won it.\r\n\r\nD’Artagnan was holding out his hand to open the _coffret_, when a ball\r\nfrom the city crushed the _coffret_ in the arms of the officer, struck\r\nD’Artagnan full in the chest, and knocked him down upon a sloping heap\r\nof earth, whilst the _fleur-de-lised baton_, escaping from the broken\r\nbox, came rolling under the powerless hand of the _marechal_. D’Artagnan\r\nendeavored to raise himself. It was thought he had been knocked down\r\nwithout being wounded. A terrible cry broke from the group of terrified\r\nofficers; the _marechal_ was covered with blood; the pallor of death\r\nascended slowly to his noble countenance. Leaning upon the arms held\r\nout on all sides to receive him, he was able once more to turn his eyes\r\ntowards the place, and to distinguish the white flag at the crest of the\r\nprincipal bastion; his ears, already deaf to the sounds of life, caught\r\nfeebly the rolling of the drum which announced the victory. Then,\r\nclasping in his nerveless hand the _baton_, ornamented with its\r\n_fleurs-de-lis_, he cast on it his eyes, which had no longer the power\r\nof looking upwards towards Heaven, and fell back, murmuring strange\r\nwords, which appeared to the soldiers cabalistic--words which had\r\nformerly represented so many things on earth, and which none but the\r\ndying man any longer comprehended:\r\n\r\n“Athos--Porthos, farewell till we meet again! Aramis, adieu forever!”\r\n\r\nOf the four valiant men whose history we have related, there now\r\nremained but one. Heaven had taken to itself three noble souls.
