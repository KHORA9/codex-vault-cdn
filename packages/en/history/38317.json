Fragments of the tale, it is true, have been\r\ntold at times; latest of all, an abstract, brief but accurate, has been\r\ngiven in Mr. Edwards' valuable _Memoirs of Libraries_. But the present\r\nnarrative, while it embraces a wider range, is, at the same time,\r\nindependent throughout of all that have preceded it, being largely\r\ncompiled from sources available only to those who are familiar with the\r\nstores of the Library and habituated to their use, as well as from\r\nprivate accounts and papers, for access to which, as for other kind\r\nassistance, the writer is indebted to the Librarian. Yet it is only as\r\nan _attempt_ that the volume asks to be received and judged; for a work\r\nof this kind cannot at once attain completeness. Its very size will show\r\nto those who are acquainted with its subject, that minuteness in detail\r\ncannot be expected. The difficulty has been, out of the abundance of\r\nmaterials, to compile an epitome which should at once be concise and\r\nyet not, through conciseness, be deprived of interest. To point out all\r\nthe special treasures in each branch in which the Library is rich, as it\r\nwould occupy the extent of several volumes, so it would require the\r\ncombined knowledge of several students, each in his several sphere.\r\nWhile, therefore, no portion of the Library has been unnoticed, it will,\r\nthe writer trusts, be readily pardoned, should those portions with which\r\nhe is specially acquainted, and in the direction of which his own line\r\nof work specially leads, seem to any to occupy more prominence than\r\nothers of equal importance. It is worthy of notice that, in tracing the\r\ngrowth and history of the Library, the fact of its older divisions\r\nhaving undergone comparatively little change in arrangement, greatly\r\nfacilitates examination, and, at the same time, often imparts an\r\ninterest of its own to well-nigh each successive shelf of books; for\r\neach tier has thus its own record of successive benefactions and\r\nsuccessive purchases to display, and leads us on step by step from one\r\nyear to another.\r\n\r\n'_Bowers of Paradise!_' Thus it was that an enthusiastic Hebrew student,\r\nwriting of the Bodleian but a few years ago, apostrophized the little\r\ncells and curtained cages wherein readers sit, while hedged in and\r\ncanopied with all the wisdom and learning of bygone generations, which\r\nhere bloom their blossoms and yield up their fruits. And, as if\r\nanswering in actual living type to the parable which the Eastern\r\nmetaphor suggests, these cells from year to year have been and (though\r\nof late more infrequently) still are, the resort of grand and grave old\r\nbees, majestic in size and deportment, of sonorous sound, and covered\r\nwith the dust, as it were, of ages. Just as a solemn rookery befits an\r\nancestral mansion, so these Bees of the Bodleian form a fitting\r\naccompaniment to the place of their choice. And while the Metaphor well\r\ndescribes the character of that place whither men resort for refreshment\r\namidst the work of the world and for the recruiting of mental strength\r\nfor the doing of such work, so the Type well describes those who from\r\nthe bowers gather sweetness and wealth, first for their own enriching\r\nand next for the enriching of others. Long then in these bowers may\r\nthere be found busy hives of men; above all, those that gather thence,\r\nabundantly, such Wisdom as is _præ melle ori_.\r\n\r\n  BODLEIAN LIBRARY,\r\n    _May_ 30, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          PAGE.\r\n\r\n  ANNALS                                                     1\r\n\r\n  APPENDIX A.

Here of old\r\nsat the Chancellor of the University, surrounded by the Doctors and\r\nMasters of the Great Congregation, in a fashion which was formerly\r\ndepicted in the great west window of St. Mary's Church, and is still\r\nrepresented on the University seal, and which, in the early part of the\r\nlast century, was adopted by Dr. Richard Rawlinson as his book-plate,\r\nbeing engraved from the impression attached to his own diploma in Civil\r\nLaw. Above this chamber there is another, lighted by four windows,\r\ncontaining forty-five feet in length and twenty in breadth, and now\r\nassigned as the lecture-room of the Professor of Law. Here was begun\r\nabout 1367, and finally established and furnished in 1409, the first\r\nactual University Library, called after Bishop Thomas Cobham, of\r\nWorcester, who about 1320 (seven years before his death) had commenced\r\npreparations for the building of the room and the making provision for\r\nits contents[1]. Wood tells us that before this time there were indeed\r\nsome books kept in chests in St. Mary's Church, which were to be lent\r\nout under pledges, as well as some chained to desks, which were only to\r\nbe read _in situ_; but _this_ University chest soon gave way to the\r\nformal Library, as, at a later period, another University chest was lost\r\nin funded investments and a banker's balance[2]. Another precursor of\r\nthe general Library was found in the collection bequeathed to Durham\r\nCollege (on the site of which now stands Trinity College) in 1345 by one\r\nof its founders, the earnest lover and preserver of books, Philip of\r\nBury; he of that charming book, that 'tractatus vere pulcherrimus,' the\r\n_Philobiblion_. He,--who apostrophizes books as the masters who teach\r\nwithout flogging or fleecing, without punishment or payment; as ears of\r\ncorn, full of grain, to be rubbed only by apostolic hands; as golden\r\npots of manna; as Noah's ark and Jacob's ladder, and Joshua's stones of\r\ntestimony and Gideon's lamps and David's scrip, and who says that in the\r\nnoblest monasteries of England he found precious volumes defiled and\r\ninjured by mice and worms, and abandoned to moths,--gave strict\r\ninjunctions for the care of the large collection, gathered from all\r\nquarters, with which he enriched his College[3]. It was to be free for\r\npurposes of study to all scholars, who might have the loan of any work\r\nof which there was a duplicate, provided they left a pledge exceeding\r\nit in value, but for purposes of transcription no volume was to go\r\nbeyond the walls of the house. A register was to be kept, and a yearly\r\nvisitation was to be held[4]. Some of these books, on the dissolution of\r\nthe College by Henry VIII, are said to have been transferred to Duke\r\nHumphrey's Library, and some to Balliol College.\r\n\r\nThe Librarian of Cobham's Library was also entitled Chaplain to the\r\nUniversity, and as such was ordered, in 1412, to offer masses yearly for\r\nthose who were benefactors of the University and Library, and was\r\nendowed with half a mark yearly, as well as with £5 issuing from the\r\nassize of bread and ale, which had been granted to the University by\r\nKing Henry IV, who was also a principal contributor to the completion of\r\nthe Library, and is therefore to this day duly remembered in the\r\nBidding-Prayer at all the academic 'Commemorationes Solenniores.' But no\r\ntrace remains of the devotional and sacred duties once attaching to the\r\noffice, and laymen have been eligible to it from the time of Bodley's\r\nre-foundation. The old regal stipend, however, amounting at last to £6\r\n13_s._ 4_d._, continued to be paid to the Librarian, until in 1856, by\r\nthe revised code of statutes, various small payments were consolidated;\r\nit is found entered in the annual printed accounts up to that year.\r\n\r\nBut not a score of years had passed after Cobham's Library had been\r\nactually completed and opened before the building of a room more worthy\r\nof the University was commenced. In 1426 the University began to erect\r\nthe present noble Divinity School for the exercises in that faculty; but\r\nas their own means soon failed they betook themselves to all likely\r\nquarters to procure help. And Duke Humphrey of Gloucester, the patron of\r\nall learning[5], and the fosterer of the New School of theological\r\nthought, the protector of Pecock, responded so liberally to the petition\r\nof the University for aid to the fabric of their Material School, that\r\nhe is styled (says Wood) in the Bedell's Book its Founder, while the\r\nroof to this day perpetuates his memory among the shields of arms of\r\nbenefactors with which its graceful pendants terminate. His gifts of\r\nmoney for the School were quickly followed by still larger gifts of\r\nbooks for the Library. Between the years 1439 and 1446 he appears to\r\nhave forwarded about 600 MSS., which were for the time deposited in\r\nchests in Cobham's Library. The first donation, consisting of 129\r\nvolumes, was forwarded in November, 1439. The letter of thanks from\r\nConvocation is dated the 25th of that month, and on the same day a\r\nletter was sent to the House of Commons, to the 'ryght worshypfull\r\nsyres, the Speker, knyghtes, and burges (_sic_) of the worshepfull\r\nparlament,' informing them that the Duke had magnified the University\r\n'with a thousand pounds worth and more of preciose bokes,' and therefore\r\nbeseeching their 'sage discrecions to considere the gloriose gifts of\r\nthe graciose prince ... for the comyn profyte and worshyp of the Reme,\r\nto thanke hym hertyly, and also prey Godde to thanke hym in tyme comyng\r\nwher goode dedys ben rewarded.' Statutes for the regulation of the gift\r\nwere made on the same day, prayers appointed, and provision made for\r\nthe observance of the Duke's obit[6]. A catalogue of 364 of the MSS. is\r\nprinted, from the lists preserved in the University Register, p. 758,\r\nvol. ii. of Rev. H. Anstey's _Documents Illustrative of Social and\r\nAcademic Life at Oxford_, published in the series of Chronicles issued\r\nby the Master of the Rolls. The extent of these gifts rendered the room\r\nat St. Mary's quite insufficient for the purpose to which it was\r\nassigned, and the University therefore, in a letter to the Duke, dated\r\nJuly 14, 1444, informed him of their intention to erect a more suitable\r\nbuilding, of which (as a delicate way, probably, of bespeaking his aid\r\ntowards the cost, as well as of testifying their gratitude for past\r\nbenefactions) they formally offered him the title of Founder. In the\r\nsubjoined note is given an extract from this letter (copied from the\r\nRegister of Convocation), which is interesting from its description of\r\nthe inconveniences of the old room, and the advantages of the new\r\nsite[7]. And this new building, first contemplated in A.D. 1444 and\r\nfinished about 1480, forms now the central portion of the great\r\nReading-Room, still retaining its old advantages of convenience and of\r\nseclusion 'a strepitu sæculari.'\r\n\r\nThe Duke's MSS. were, as became the object of his gift, very varied in\r\ncharacter. With works in Divinity are mingled in the catalogue a large\r\nnumber in Medicine and Science, together with some in lighter\r\nliterature, amongst which latter are found no less than seven MSS. of\r\nPetrarch and three of Boccaccio. Some additional MSS., being 'all the\r\nLatyn bokes that he had,' together with £100 towards the completion of\r\nthe 'Divyne Scoles,' which the Duke had intended to bequeath, but the\r\nformal bequest of which was prevented by his dying intestate in 1447,\r\nwere subsequently procured, although with considerable difficulty[8].\r\nBut only three out of the whole number of his MSS. are now known to\r\nexist in the present Library. One of these is a fine copy of books\r\niv.-ix. of Valerius Maximus, with the commentary by D. de Burgo, and\r\nwith an index by John de Whethamstede, Abbot of St. Alban's (now marked,\r\nAuctarium, F. infra, i. 1[9]); the second is a translation by L. Aretine\r\nof the Politics of Aristotle (marked, Auct. F. v. 27); and the third,\r\nthe Epistles of Pliny (Auct. F. ii. 23). The first bears the Duke's\r\narms; the second has an original dedication to him by the translator;\r\nthe last (which was restored to the University by Dr. Robert Master,\r\nOct. 30, 1620) contains his own autograph. Six MSS. now in the British\r\nMuseum, which formerly belonged to the Duke, are described in Sir H.\r\nEllis' _Letters of Eminent Literary Men_, (printed by the Camden\r\nSociety,) pp. 357-8. Two of these appear in the List of Humphrey's\r\nbenefaction to Oxford; for Harl. 1705, which is a translation of Plato's\r\nPolitics by Peter Candidus, or White, who gave it to the Duke, is\r\ndoubtless the book entered at the end of the List as 'Item, novam\r\ntraductionem totius Politeiæ Platonicæ;' while Cotton, Nero. D. v., the\r\nActs of the Council of Constance, appears at fol. 67. Another of these\r\nsix MSS., Harl. 988, is an anonymous commentary on the Canticles[10],\r\nwhich formerly belonged to Sir Robert Cotton, and which contains an\r\ninscription by him intended to commemorate his returning it to the\r\nUniversity Library in 1602. It came into Harley's possession amongst\r\nBishop Stillingfleet's MSS., all of which were bought by him. A letter\r\nfrom Wanley to Hearne, in which the book is mentioned, is preserved in\r\nthe Bodleian in a Rawlinson MS. (Letters xvii.) under date of Oct. 13,\r\n1714, Hearne's reply to which is printed by Sir H. Ellis, _ubi supra_;\r\nwhile Wanley's rejoinder is also found in the above MS, dated Oct. 27,\r\nin which he says, 'As for my Lord's MS. of the Canticles, designed for\r\nthe Bodleyan Library by Sir Robert Cotton, I know not how you find it to\r\nhave once belonged to Humphrey, duke of Gloucester. My Lord has indeed\r\ntwo of his books, which we know to have been his, for certain; because\r\none of them (which was given to his Lordship) hath a note therein of his\r\nhand-writing, and the other hath his armes and stile on the outside, as\r\nalso his library-mark. This last (which was bought of Sir Simonds\r\nD'Ewes), together with the Cotton MS. of the Canticles, I besought his\r\nLordship to give to the University for your Library, and I hope his\r\nLordship will do so in a little time.' Another of the Duke's books,\r\nbeing Capgrave's Commentary on Genesis, which occurs in the second list\r\nof those given to the University, is now in the library of Oriel\r\nCollege. One volume, containing, among other philosophical treatises,\r\nPlato's _Phædo_, _Timæus_, &c., with the Duke's autograph, 'Cest livre a\r\nmoy Homfrey duc de Gloucestre' (given to him by an Abbot of St. Alban's)\r\nis in Corpus Christi College, 243. And a copy of Wickliffe's Bible, in\r\ntwo volumes, which bears Humphrey's arms, is amongst the Egerton MSS.\r\n(617-8), Brit. Mus.\r\n\r\nThe large increase of treasures which these benefactions brought to the\r\nUniversity probably caused the first institution of a formal Visitation.\r\nOn Nov. 29, 1449, we find that Visitors were appointed by Congregation\r\nfor the purpose of receiving from the Chaplain an account of the books\r\ncontained in the Library[11].\r\n\r\nDuke Humphrey was followed in the good work of the Divinity School and\r\nLibrary by another whose name still retains its place in the formal list\r\nof benefactors, Bishop Thomas Kempe, of London, who, besides\r\ncontributing very largely in money towards the completion of the former,\r\nsent some books to the latter in 1487, some seven years after the new\r\nroom had been finally completed and opened for use. But Antony Wood (in\r\nwhose pages records of other benefactors may be found) tells us that\r\nvery few years passed before the Library began to lose some of its\r\nnewly-acquired treasures; for Scholars borrowed books upon petty and\r\ninsufficient pledges, and so chose to forfeit the latter rather than\r\nreturn the former[12], while tradition reported that Polydore Virgil,\r\nthe historian, being at length refused any further opportunities of\r\nabstraction, obtained a special licence from Henry VIII for the taking\r\nout any MS. for his use! From this traditionary report Sir H. Ellis, in\r\nhis introduction to a translation of Virgil's history, printed for the\r\nCamden Society in 1844, endeavours to vindicate his author's reputation,\r\nbut more by conjecture than evidence. In 1513 a Chaplain and Librarian\r\nwas elected, named Adam Kirkebote[13]. The new Librarian, soon after,\r\nsupplicated Congregation that on Festival Days he should not be bound to\r\nopen the Library before twelve o'clock; a practice which, commencing at\r\nthat day, does still unto this (the Library on Holy Days during Term\r\nbeing now not opened until the conclusion of the University sermon, at\r\neleven o'clock) witness to the religious spirit which pervades all the\r\nold institutions of Oxford. In 1527, when one Flecher was Chaplain, it\r\nis recorded[14] that 'Magister' Claymond (doubtless the President of\r\nCorpus Christi College, of that name) was permitted by vote of\r\nCongregation to take Pliny's Natural History out of the Library. In 1543\r\nHumphrey Burnford was elected Chaplain on Oct. 31, in the room of --\r\nWhytt, deceased[15]. It was probably during his tenure of office that\r\nthe Library was destroyed. For in 1550 the Commissioners deputed by\r\nEdward VI for reformation of the University visited the Libraries in the\r\nspirit of John Knox, destroying, without examination, all MSS.\r\nornamented by illuminations or rubricated initials as being eminently\r\nPopish, and leaving the rest exposed to any chance of injury and\r\nrobbery. The traditions which Wood has recorded as having been learned\r\nat the mouths of aged men who had in their turn received them from those\r\nwho were contemporaneous with the Visitation, are abundantly confirmed\r\nby the well-known descriptions of Leland and Bale of what went on in\r\nother places, and therefore, although no direct documentary evidence of\r\nthe proceedings of the spoilers is known to exist, we may believe that\r\nWood's account of pillage and waste, of MSS. burned, and sold to tailors\r\nfor their measures, to bookbinders for covers, and the like, until not\r\none remained _in situ_, is not a whit exaggerated. One solitary entry\r\nthere is, however, in the University Register (I. fol. 157^a), which,\r\nwhile it records the completion of the catastrophe, sufficiently thereby\r\ncorroborates the story of all that preceded, viz. the entry which tells\r\nthat in Convocation on Jan. 25, 1555-6, 'electi sunt hii venerabiles\r\nviri, Vice-cancellarius et Procuratores, Magister Morwent, præses\r\nCorporis Christi, et Magister Wright, ad vendenda subsellia librorum in\r\npublica Academiæ bibliotheca, ipsius Universitatis nomine.' The books of\r\nthe 'public' library had all disappeared; what need then to retain the\r\nshelves and stalls, when no one thought of replacing their contents, and\r\nwhen the University could turn an honest penny by their sale? and so the\r\n_venerabiles viri_ made a timber-yard of Duke Humphrey's treasure-house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut four years after the final despoiling of the Library there was an\r\nundergraduate entered at Magdalen College, who, by the good Providence\r\nwhich always out of evil brings somewhat to counterpoise and correct,\r\nwas to be moved by the sight of the ruin and desolation to restore what\r\nhis seniors had destroyed, and to reconstruct the old Plantagenet's\r\nLibrary on such a basis, and with such means for carrying on its\r\nre-edification, that the glory of the latter house should soon eclipse\r\nthat of the former. All around him he doubtless found traces of the\r\nrecent destruction; his stationer may have sold him books bound in\r\nfragments of those MSS. for which the University but a century before\r\nhad consecrated the memory of the donors in her solemn prayers; the\r\ntailor who measured him for his sad-coloured doublet, may have done it\r\nwith a strip of parchment brilliant with gold, that had consequently\r\nbeen condemned as Popish, or covered with strange symbols of an old\r\nheathen Greek's devising, that probably passed for magical and unlawful\r\nincantations. And the soul of the young student must have burned with\r\nshame and indignation at the apathy which had not merely tolerated this\r\ndestruction by strangers, but had contentedly assisted in carrying it\r\nout to its thorough completion. Himself a successful student, he became\r\neager to help others to whom thus the advantages of a library were\r\ndenied; and, for a while without fee or reward, undertook a public Greek\r\nlecture in the Hall of Merton College, to which college he had been\r\nelected in 1563[16]. And when, after years thus spent in academic\r\npursuits, THOMAS BODLEY betook himself to diplomatic service abroad, he\r\nstill, amidst all the distractions of foreign and domestic politics,\r\npreserved his affection for the scenes and the studies of his early\r\nfamiliarity. So, when the days came wherein statecraft began to weary\r\nhim and Courts ceased to charm, his thoughts reverted to the place\r\nwhere, free from these, he might still, although in a more private\r\ncapacity, labour for the good of the commonwealth; he remembered the\r\nroom once precious to students, 'scientiarum sedes,' as the University\r\nhad called it of old, but now destitute alike both of science and of\r\nseats. 'And thus,' says he himself, 'I concluded at the last to set up\r\nmy staff at the Library-door in Oxon; being thoroughly persuaded that,\r\nin my solitude and surcease from the commonwealth-affairs, I could not\r\nbusy myself to better purpose than by reducing that place (which then in\r\nevery part lay ruined and waste) to the publick use of students[17].' So\r\ntherefore, on Feb. 23, 1597-8, he wrote a letter to the Vice-Chancellor,\r\noffering that whereas 'there hath bin heretofore a publike library in\r\nOxford, which, you know, is apparant by the roome itself remayning, and\r\nby your statute records, I will take the charge and cost upon me, to\r\nreduce it again to his former use,' first by fitting it up with shelves\r\nand seats, next by procuring benefactions of books, and lastly by\r\nendowing it with an annual rent[18]. This offer being accepted with\r\ngreat gratitude, other letters followed from him in March, in which he\r\ndesired that delegates should be chosen to consider the best mode of\r\nfitting up the room, and mentioned an offer on the part of his own\r\nCollege, Merton, to provide timber for the purpose. Two years were spent\r\nin the carrying out of this work and in the preliminary arrangements.\r\nAmongst these preparations was the putting up the beautiful roof which\r\nto this day is such an object of deserved admiration. It is divided into\r\nsquare compartments, on each of which are painted the arms of the\r\nUniversity, being the open Bible, with seven seals[19], between three\r\nducal crowns, on the open pages of which are the words (so truly fitting\r\nfor a Christian School) 'DOMINUS Illuminatio mea[20];' while on bosses\r\nthat intervene between each compartment are painted the arms of Bodley\r\nhimself, being five martlets with a crescent for difference, quartered\r\nwith the arms of Hone (his mother's family), two bars wavy between three\r\nbillets; on a chief the three ducal crowns of the University shield,\r\n'quarum merito gloriam ab Academia derivavit.' (Wake, _Rex Platon_. p.\r\n12.) The striking motto 'Quarta perennis erit' was assigned to Bodley at\r\nthe same time with this academic augmentation[21]. When, in 1610, the\r\neastern wing of the Library was erected, a similar roof was added, as\r\nwas also done to the Picture Gallery (built between 1613-1619); in the\r\nlatter room the roof, having become decayed and out of repair, was\r\nunhappily altogether removed in the year 1831, and a plaster ceiling,\r\ndivided into compartments, substituted. A few of the panels of this roof\r\nhave been preserved, one bearing the figures of two cats, which used to\r\nbe an object of interest to juvenile visitors, and a series bearing the\r\nletters which compose Sir Thomas Bodley's name, together with a portrait\r\nof him upon a centre panel. A high-backed arm-chair, the Librarian's\r\nseat of office in the Library, was formed out of oak from the roof, and\r\nan engraving hangs in the Gallery which represents the room before its\r\nchange for the worse.\r\n\r\nOn June 25, 1600, Bodley wrote to the Vice-Chancellor, mentioning that,\r\nas the mechanical work was now brought to a good pass, he had begun to\r\nbusy himself in the gathering of books, and had provided a Register for\r\nthe enrolment of the names of all benefactors, with particulars of their\r\ngifts. This Register (formerly, like all the books in folio, chained to\r\nits desk), consisting of two large folio volumes, on vellum, now lies on\r\na table in the great room, and is an object of notice by most visitors.\r\nThe volumes are ornamented exteriorly with silver-gilt bosses on their\r\nmassy covers, on which are engraved the arms of Bodley and those of the\r\nUniversity, and interiorly in many places with the donors' coats of arms\r\npainted in their proper colours, and with various devices. Vol. i.\r\nextends from 1600 to 1688, containing 428 pages in double columns; and\r\ncommences with a printed record of the gifts for the first four years,\r\non pp. 1-90. The following printed title is prefixed: 'Munificentissimis\r\natque optimis cujusvis ordinis, dignitatis, sexus, qui Bibliothecam hanc\r\nlibris, aut pecuniis numeratis ad libros coemendos, aliove quovis genere\r\nampliarunt, Thomas Bodleius, eques auratus, honorarium hoc volumen, in\r\nquod hujuscemodi donationes, simulque nomina donantium singillatim\r\nreferuntur, pietatis, memoriæ, virtutisque causa, dedit, dedicavit.' A\r\nparagraph follows, which mentions Bodley's own work of refitting and\r\nendowing, and notes that his own large gifts are not entered because he\r\nhopes throughout his life to make continually large additions. The whole\r\nof this title is printed in the preface to James' first Catalogue,\r\nissued in 1605, who was probably part-writer of it[22]. Wake (_Rex\r\nPlatonicus_, p. 120) speaks of the Register, 'aureis umbilicis\r\nfibulisque fulgidum,' as always lying 'eminentissimo loco,' a prominent\r\nobject of notice to all who entered the Library. Vol. ii. extends from\r\n1692 to 1795, ending in the middle of the volume, on p. 216; but there\r\nis reason to fear that there are many omissions in the later portion of\r\nits period. Each volume has an index of names. The gifts of the\r\nprincipal donors, as recorded in this Register up to its close, are\r\nprinted in Gutch's edition of _Wood's History_, vol. ii. part ii. pp.\r\n920-950. It will not be necessary, therefore, to mention here the names\r\nof many, but of such only as are 'e principibus principes.' From the\r\nyear 1796 inclusive, when the gifts of donors began to be entered in the\r\nannual printed catalogues of purchases and statements of accounts, this\r\nMS. Register ceased to be used.\r\n\r\nAmong the first and largest benefactors in the year 1600 occur Lord\r\nBuckhurst (afterwards Earl of Dorset), the Earl of Essex, Lords Hunsdon,\r\nMontacute, [editions of the Fathers], Lisle (afterwards Leicester),\r\nLumley[23], and William Gent, who gave a large collection of books,\r\nchiefly medical.\r\n\r\nMany volumes were given about this time by Bodley, which had been\r\ncollected in Italy by Bill, the London bookseller, who was employed by\r\nSir Thomas to travel on the Continent as his agent for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe famous copy of the French _Romance of Alexander_ (now numbered Bodl.\r\n264) must have been one of the MSS. given by Bodley himself at the\r\ncommencement of his work, as it is found entered in the printed\r\nCatalogue of 1605, but does not occur in the Benefactors' Register. It\r\nis decorated with a large number of beautiful paintings on a chequered\r\nbackground of gold and colour; but its special interest lies in the\r\nillustrations at the foot of about half the pages, which exhibit the\r\nmost quaint and grotesque representations of customs, trades,\r\namusements, dress, &c., of the time. Some of these were engraved by\r\nStrutt; and four specimens, together with one of the larger miniatures\r\nillustrating the text, are given by Dibdin in his _Bibl. Decam._ vol.\r\ni., where, at pp. 198-201, he discourses, in his own peculiar fashion,\r\non the merits of the volume. A notice of the book may also be found in\r\nWarton's _Hist. of Engl. Poetry_, edit. 1840, vol. i. p. 142. At f. 208\r\nis the following colophon, which is of much interest, as affording\r\nevidence that the work of the painter occupied upwards of five years:--\r\n\r\n    'Che define li romans du boin roi Alixandre,\r\n    Et les veus du pavon, les accomplissemens,\r\n    Le Restor du pavon et le pris, qui fu perescript\r\n    Le xviii^e ior de Decembre, lan M.ccc.xxxviii.\r\n    Explicit iste liber, scriptor sit crimine liber,\r\n    Xpristus scriptorem custodiat ac det honorem.\r\n\r\n    (_In gold letters._) 'Che liure fu perfais de le enluminure au\r\n    xviii^e jour dauryl. Per Jehan de grise, Lan de grace, M.ccc.xliij.'\r\n\r\nThis is followed by a continuation (of later date) of the romance, in\r\nNorthern-English verse, on seven leaves[24]; and lastly, by a French\r\nRomance of the 'grant kaan à la graunt cite de Tambaluc.' A scribe's\r\nname is given in the following lines on f. 208, but in a hand apparently\r\nnot that of any part of the book:--\r\n\r\n    'Laus tibi sit Christe, quoniam liber explicit iste.\r\n    Nomen scriptoris est Thomas Plenus Amoris[25].'\r\n\r\nThe earliest owner's name occurring in the volume is that of 'Richart\r\nde Widevelle, seigneur de Rivières,' recorded in an inscription on the\r\ncover at the end, which proceeds to say that 'le dist Seigneur acetast\r\nle dist liure lan de grace mille cccclxvi. le premier jour de lan a\r\nLondres.' Rivers' own autograph follows ('Ryverys'), with some words in\r\nFrench, written in a perfectly frantic scrawl. Subsequent owners were\r\n'Gyles Strangwayes' and 'Jaspere Ffylolle' (whose signatures are\r\nengraved by Dibdin, _ubi supra_), and 'Thomas Smythe[26].'\r\n\r\n[1] When Duke Humphrey's Library was completed, and the books were\r\nremoved thither, this upper room took the place of that beneath it as\r\nthe Convocation House, 'in which upper room,' says Hearne, 'was brave\r\npainted glass containing the arms of the benefactors, which painted\r\nglass continued till the times of the late rebellion.' (Bliss, _Reliquiæ\r\nHearnianæ_, ii. 693.)\r\n\r\n[2] The original treasure-chest, from which all academic money-grants\r\nare still said to be made, is preserved in the Bursary of Corpus Christi\r\nCollege, in which college it was kept in accordance with the statutes of\r\nthe University, tit. xx. § 1.\r\n\r\n[3] The Bishop's Bibliomania is thus noticed by a contemporary, W. de\r\nChambre, in his _Continuatio Hist. Dunelm._ (_Hist. Dunelm. Scriptt.\r\ntres_; Surtees Society, 1839, p. 130):--'Iste summe delectabatur in\r\nmultitudine librorum. Plures enim libros habuit, sicut passim dicebatur,\r\nquam omnes Pontifices Angliæ. Et præter eos quos habuit in diversis\r\nmaneriis suis, repositos separatim, ubicunque cum sua familia residebat,\r\ntot libri jacebant sparsim in camera qua dormivit, quod ingredientes vix\r\nstare poterant vel incedere nisi librum aliquem pedibus conculcarent.'\r\nThe bedroom of the late centenarian President of Magdalene College, Dr.\r\nRouth, was in this respect just like Bishop Bury's; and as the latter\r\nsent his library from Durham to be in some sort a nucleus for an\r\nUniversity Library at Oxford, so the former bequeathed his to Durham\r\nthat it might assist the development of the University Library there.\r\n\r\n[4] _Philobiblion_, cap. xix.\r\n\r\n[5] His love of literature was evinced by the motto which, according to\r\nLeland, was frequently written by him in his books: 'Moun bien mondain.'\r\n(Hearne's _MS. Diary_, xxxvi. 199.) Hearne, in his esteem for the memory\r\nof this 'religious, good, and learned Prince,' quaintly says that he\r\nused, whenever he saw his handwriting in the Bodleian Library (where it\r\noccurs several times), 'to show a sort of particular respect' to it.\r\n(_Preface to Langtoft_, p. xx.) Was this 'sort of respect' a reverential\r\nkiss, such as that with which (as Warton in his _Companion to the Guide_\r\ntells us) he saluted the pavement of sheeps' trotters, supposed by him\r\nto be a Roman tesselated floor?\r\n\r\n[6] Register of Convoc. F., ff. 53^b, 54^b. The subsequent gifts are\r\nentered in the same Register as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. Last day of Feb., 1440. A letter to thank the Duke for 126\r\n      volumes brought by John Kyrkeby. (f. 57^b.)\r\n\r\n    2. Nov. 10, 1441. Letter acknowledging ten books (Treatises of\r\n      Augustine, Rabanus, &c.,) received through Will. Say, proctor, and\r\n      John Kyrkeby. (ff. 59^b-60.)\r\n\r\n    3. Jan. 25, 1443. Letter of thanks for 139 volumes. (f. 63.)\r\n\r\n    4. Oct. 1443. Letter for another gift, number of volumes not\r\n      specified. (f. 66.)\r\n\r\n    5. Feb. 25, 1443 (-4?). Catalogue of 135 volumes. (ff. 67-68^b.)\r\n\r\n    6. Feb. 1446. Letter of thanks for another gift, not specified. (f.\r\n      75^b.)\r\n\r\n[7] 'Nemo illos [libros] sine admiratione conspicit, cunctis una voce\r\ntestantibus, se nunquam libros tanta claritate conspicuos, tanta\r\ngravitate refertos vidisse.... Et uc per hoc, si quid maximo addi\r\npossit, tantæ munificentiæ gloria fiat illustrior, optamus sacram et\r\ncelebrem scientiarum sedem reparari, ubi honorificentius et ad\r\nutilitatem studentium multo commodius libri vestri, ab aliis segregati,\r\ncollocentur. Jam enim si quis, ut fit, uni libro inhæreat, aliis studere\r\nvolentibus ad tres vel quatuor pro vicinitate colligationis præcludit\r\naccessum. Itaque locus huic rei nobis maxime videtur idoneus ubi\r\nvenerabilis vir, modo Cancellarius noster, semper reverendus pater\r\namantissimus Magister Thomas Chace, spectabilem novarum Scolarum\r\nfabricam ad cætera suæ virtutis testimonia insigni mensura ab humo\r\nerexit, quam nos cito, quoad exigua suppetebat facultas, promovimus. Hic\r\nlocus, propterea quod a strepitu sæculari removetur, Bibliotecæ admodum\r\nvidetur conveniens, cujus fundationis titulum, si Magnanimitati vestræ\r\nacceptabilis fuerit, cum omni devotione offerrimus.' Register F. ff.\r\n71^b, 72. We find from an entry on the latter page that on January 13,\r\n1444 (-5), 'liber Platonis in Phedro' (_sic_) was lent by Convocation to\r\nthe Duke.\r\n\r\n[8] They were not received by August, 1450, on the 28th of which month a\r\nletter was written from Convocation to Thomas Bokelonde, Esq., and John\r\nSummerset, M.D., on the subject. (Register F. ff. 88^b-9.)\r\n\r\n[9] It contains inscriptions recording its gift by Whethamstede 'ad usum\r\nscolarium studencium Oxoniæ,' with anathemas upon those who should\r\nalienate it, or destroy, were it but its title: 'Si quis rapiat, raptim\r\ntitulumve retractet, vel Judæ laqueum vel furcas sensiat.'\r\n\r\n[10] Two treatises on the Canticles, by Gilbert Porret and Musca, were\r\ncontained in the Duke's first gift to Oxford. (Anstey, vol. ii. p. 759.)\r\n\r\n[11] Wood MS. F. 27. (Bodl. Libr.)\r\n\r\n[12] A sale of a collection of (apparently) these forfeited pledges, or\r\nelse of books deposited as securities for loans of money, took place in\r\nthe year 1546. On Jan. 18, 1545-6, the following decree passed\r\nConvocation: 'Decretum est authoritate Convocationis Magnæ ut cistæ in\r\ndomo inferiori sub domo Congregationis, et omnes libri pro pignoribus\r\njacentes, aut etiam alii in eadem domo inventi, venderentur, secundum\r\narbitrium quinque in eadem Convocatione eligendorum. Electi itaque sunt\r\net a Vice-Cancellario admissi ibidem, Doctor Standishe, Mr. Parret,\r\nprocurator, Mr. Slythers, Mr. Symonds, et Mr. Wattsone.' Reg. I. 107^b.\r\n\r\n[13] Wood MS. F. 27.\r\n\r\n[14] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[15] Ibid. fol. 94^a.\r\n\r\n[16] Bodley appears to have been altogether an accomplished linguist.\r\nJames, in the preface to the first Catalogue of 1605, after speaking of\r\nhis proficiency in the classical languages, adds, 'Linguas vero\r\nexoticas, veluti Italicam, Gallicam, Hispanicam, Hebræam præcipue,\r\ncæterarum omnium parentem, tam perfecte callet, ut illo neminem fere\r\nscientiorem invenies.' And in one of four letters addressed to him on\r\nthe interpretation of passages in the Old Testament, which are printed\r\namong the Epistles of J. Drusius, _De Quæsitis_ (1595, p. 40), Drusius\r\nsays, 'Vere dicam, Bodlæe, et intelligis optime litteras Hebræas, et\r\namas unice earum peritos.' The same volume contains also one letter to\r\nhis brothers, Laurence, Miles, and Josias, on the _Pastor_ of Hermas.\r\n\r\n[17] _Reliquiæ Bodleianæ_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[18] This letter (with the subsequent correspondence) is printed by\r\nHearne, at the end of the Chronicle of John of Glastonbury, vol. ii. p.\r\n612, from the Reg. of Convoc. M^a. f. 31^a.\r\n\r\n[19] Most probably intended to refer to the Apocalyptic book (Rev. v.\r\n1.), and to signify the unsealing of Divine Revelation, the fountain of\r\nall wisdom, by our Blessed Lord. Sir J. Wake prefers to take the seven\r\nseals as representing the seven liberal arts.\r\n\r\n[20] The motto appears to have varied. It is sometimes given in titles\r\nof books printed at Oxford about the time of James I, as 'Sapientiæ et\r\nFelicitatis;' and in an heraldic MS. of the seventeenth century as 'XX.\r\nExod. Decem ... Omnipotens mandata. Verbum Dei manet in eternum. Amen.'\r\n(Rawl. B. xl. f. 81.) Others [have] this, 'Veritas liberabit, Bonitas\r\nregnabit;' and others this, 'In principio erat Verbum,' &c. (Hearne, in\r\nRawl. MS. C. 876, f. 51.)\r\n\r\n[21] Wake notices it as a singular coincidence that the Library was\r\nfirst opened on the day of the 'Quatuor coronati Martyres,' Nov. 8,\r\nwhom, by mistake, he calls 'Tres.'\r\n\r\n[22] See _Reliquiæ Bodleianæ_, p. 158.\r\n\r\n[23] One of the books given by Lord Lumley has the autograph of Cranmer,\r\n'Thomas Cantuarien.,' on the title-page. The book, appositely enough,\r\nbears the title of _Sicbardi Antidotum contra diversas omnium fere\r\nsæculorum bæreses_, fol. Bas. 1528.\r\n\r\n[24] Printed by Rev. J. Stevenson at the end of the _Romance of\r\nAlexander_, edited by him for the Roxburghe Club in 1849, from Ashmole\r\nMS. 44.\r\n\r\n[25] _Plenus-Amoris_, or _Fullalove_, seems to have been the name of a\r\nfamily of scribes. But the expression seems often also to have been used\r\nfor the mere sake of rhyme. In the colophon of a translation of Alan\r\nChartier in Rawl. A. 338, are these lines:--\r\n\r\n        'Nomen scriptoris,\r\n    Dei gracia, Plenus Amoris:\r\n        Careat meroris\r\n    Deus det sibi omnibus horis.'\r\n\r\nPeter Plenus-Amoris was the scribe of Fairfax 6; Thomas, of Univ. Coll.\r\nMS. 142; William, of All Souls' 51; Geoffrey, of Sloane 513 (Brit. Mus.)\r\nIn the following instances the name appears to be used only\r\nrhythmically:--\r\n\r\n  'Nomen scriptoris est Jhon Wilde plenus amoris.'--(_Rawlinson B._ 214.)\r\n\r\n  'Nomen scriptoris Jon. semper plenus amoris,\r\n  Esteby cognomen, cui semper det Deus homen' (_sic_).--(_Bodl._ 643.)\r\n\r\n[26] Probably this book is the 'large liure en fraunceis tresbien\r\nesluminez de le Rymance de Alexandre,' once in the library of Tho. of\r\nWoodstock, Duke of Glouc. See Mr. Coxe's pref. to Gower's _Vox Clam._\r\n(Roxb. Club, 1850,) p. 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1601.\r\n\r\nIt is from this date that our notes on the history of the Library can\r\nbegin to assume an annalistic form. A gift of £20 from Herbert\r\nWestphaling, Bishop of Hereford, was expended in the purchase of books\r\nwith great success; no fewer than thirty were obtained, and amongst them\r\nwere, 'Evangelia quatuor Saxonica, lingua et charactere vetustiss.,'\r\nbeing the MS. from which John Foxe had taken the text of the Saxon\r\nGospels in the edition published at the expense of Archbishop Parker in\r\n1571, and which was subsequently re-edited by Junius. It is now\r\nnumbered, Bodl. MS. 441. An early edition (qu. _editio princeps?_) of\r\nthe Gospels in the Russian language (now placed among the Bodley MSS.\r\n213) appears among some books given by Sir Henry Savile[27], whose\r\nbrother-historian and antiquary, William Camden, is also registered as\r\nthe donor of a few MSS. and printed books. Thomas Allen, M.A., of\r\nGloucester Hall, the astrologer, gave twenty MSS[28]; the rest of his\r\ncollection came subsequently to the Library, included in that of Sir\r\nKenelm Digby, to whom Allen had bequeathed it. One of the twenty now\r\ngiven was an extremely curious volume, chiefly written in the ninth\r\ncentury (marked Auctarium F. iv. 32), including in its contents an\r\noriginal drawing (engraved in Hickes' _Thesaurus_, p. 144) by St.\r\nDunstan of himself as prostrate at the feet of the throned Christ[29], a\r\ngrammatical tract by Eutychius (or Eutex, as the scribe calls him, while\r\nprofessing doubt as to the right form), with Welsh glosses (noticed by\r\nLhuyd in his _Archæol. Brit._ p. 226); the first book of Ovid _De Arte\r\namandi_, with similar glosses[30]; and lections in Greek and Latin from\r\nthe Prophets and Pentateuch, amongst which is one from Hosea containing,\r\nin the Latin version, a line or two unlike any known early version,\r\n(although faithful to the Hebrew), but found also in a quotation in\r\nGildas[31]. Capt. Josias Bodley[32] gave an astronomical sphere and\r\nother instruments in brass, which now stand in the south window\r\nadjoining the entrance to the Library. But the great benefactor of the\r\nyear was the newly-appointed Librarian, Thomas James, who gave various\r\nMSS., chiefly patristic (which, however, Wood says, 'he had taken out of\r\nseveral College libraries'), and sixty printed volumes. From the first\r\npreparation of the new foundation Bodley had fixed upon James, then a\r\nFellow of New College, as his Library-Keeper. The volume of letters\r\npublished by Hearne (from Bodl. MS. 699) in 1703, under the title of\r\n_Reliquiæ Bodleianæ_, consists chiefly of those which the Founder\r\naddressed to James while his collection of books was in process of\r\nformation, but unfortunately they have no dates of years, and Hearne\r\nprinted them simply as they came into his hands, without any attempt to\r\ndetermine their order of sequence. We learn from these that James'\r\nsalary at the outset was £5 13_s._ 4_d._ quarterly; but almost at once\r\nhe threatened to 'strike' unless it were raised to an annual stipend of\r\n£30 or £40, while at the same time he demanded permission to marry. This\r\nlatter requisition appeared particularly grievous to Bodley, who had\r\nmade celibacy a stringent condition in his Statutes, and he forthwith\r\nexpostulated strongly with his Librarian on these his 'unseasonable and\r\nunreasonable motions' (p. 52). The upshot, however, was that Bodley,\r\nvery unwillingly, consented to become the 'first breaker' of his own\r\ninstitution, (which 'hereafter,' he says, 'I purpose to become\r\ninviolable,') and, for the love he bore to James, allowed him to\r\nmarry[33]. But it was not until the year 1813 that the Statute was\r\naltered and the Librarian released from his obligation of perpetual\r\ncelibacy, and even then, by a singular and unmeaning compromise, it was\r\nordered that he, as well as the Under-Librarians, should be unmarried\r\n_at the time of election_. The whole restriction was, however, finally\r\nremoved on the revision of the Statutes in 1856. But its infringement\r\nappears to have been again tolerated, in one instance, at least, during\r\nthe last century, viz. in the case of Dr. Hudson. Hearne[34] enters the\r\nfollowing 'memorandum' of uncharitable hearsay gossip respecting his\r\nquondam chief and friend: 'Dr. Hudson was married when he was elected\r\nLibrarian. His first wife was one Biesley. That he hath now is his\r\nsecond. It is said that he was married to this Biesley when he was\r\nTaberder of Queen's. The Dr. hath been of a loose, profligate, and\r\nirreligious life, as I have often heard. The family of the Harrisons he\r\nis married into now is good for just nothing, being as stingy (if it can\r\nbe) as himself.'\r\n\r\n[27] Savile's benefactions were continued in the years 1609 and 1614,\r\nand in 1620 he sent a large number of Greek and Latin MSS.\r\n\r\n[28] In the year 1604 he appears again as the donor of some printed\r\nbooks. A notice of one of his MSS. (now Bodl. 198), which once belonged\r\nto Bishop Grosteste, was by him given to the Friars Minor at Oxford, and\r\nby them, about 1433, to Gascoigne, who presented it to Durham College,\r\nis to be found in Warton's _Life of Sir T. Pope_, 1772, pp. 392-3. The\r\nvolume contains MS. notes by both Grosteste and Gascoigne.\r\n\r\n[29] Another relic of Dunstan is preserved among the Hatton MSS. No. 30\r\nof that collection. 'Expositio Augustini in Apocalypsin,' written in\r\nAnglo-Saxon characters, has the following inscription in large letters\r\non the last leaf: 'Dunstan abbas hunc libellum scribere jussit.'\r\n\r\n[30] These glosses, together with an 'Alphabetum Nemnivi' in Runic\r\ncharacters, (of which a facsimile is given in Hickes' _Thesaurus_, p.\r\n168), and some Welsh and Latin notes on weights and measures, are\r\nprinted, with copious notes, by Zeuss in his _Grammatica Celtica_, 8vo.\r\nLeipz. 1853, vol. ii. pp. 1076-96. The MS. is described also in Wanley's\r\nCatalogue, p. 63, and the latest account of it, together with a\r\nfacsimile from the tract by Eutychius, is to be found in Villemarqué's\r\n_Notice des principaux MSS. des anciens Bretons_, 8vo. Par. 1856. And\r\nthe Alphabet of Nemnivus, together with another, and somewhat later,\r\nRunic Alphabet (of the 'winged' form), found in Bodl. MS. 572, is\r\nprinted at pp. 10-12 of the _Ancient Welsh Grammar of Edeyrn_, edited\r\nfor the Welsh MSS. Soc. in 1856 by Rev. John Williams, ab Ithel.\r\n\r\n[31] This reading was pointed out to the author by Rev. A. W. Haddan,\r\nB.D.\r\n\r\n[32] Afterwards Sir Josias, a younger brother of Sir Thomas, and\r\nGovernor of Duncannon in Ireland, author of a humorous Latin tour in\r\nLecale (a barony in the county of Down), which, although not\r\nunfrequently met with in MS, has never yet been printed.\r\n\r\n[33] _Reliquiæ Bodl._ p. 162. See also p. 183.\r\n\r\n[34] _Diary_, vol. lviii. p. 157.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1602.\r\n\r\nThe largest pecuniary donor of this year was Blount, Lord Mountjoy\r\n(afterwards Earl of Devon), who forwarded £100 to Sir T. Bodley from\r\nWaterford; which were expended upon books in most classes of literature,\r\nincluding music. Among various gifts of MSS. were some Russian volumes\r\nfrom Lancelot Browne, M.D., and (together with Persian, Finnish, &c.)\r\nfrom Sir Rich. Lee, ambassador in Muscovy. Lord Cobham gave £50 in\r\nmoney, with the promise of 'divers MSS. out of St. Augustin's library in\r\nCanterbury[35].' 'Biblia Latina pulcherrima,' 2 vols. fol. was given by\r\nGeorge Rives, Warden of New College. This is probably a huge and\r\nmagnificent specimen of twelfth-century work, now numbered Auctarium, E.\r\ninfra, 1, 2[36]. But the year was specially marked by the donation of 47\r\nMSS. (including some early English volumes) from Walter (afterwards Sir\r\nWalter) Cope; and above all, by the gift, from the Dean and Chapter of\r\nExeter to their fellow-countryman Bodley, of 81 Latin MSS. from their\r\nChapter Library. By what right they thus alienated their corporate\r\nproperty no one probably cared to enquire; but, from the tokens of\r\nneglect still visible upon the books, we may conclude that only by this\r\nalienation were they in all likelihood saved from ultimate destruction:\r\nfor they nearly all bear more or less sign of having been exposed to\r\ngreat damp, which in several instances has well-nigh destroyed the\r\ninitial and final leaves. Most of them are beautiful specimens of early\r\npenmanship, ranging chiefly from the eleventh century to the thirteenth;\r\nand amongst them is that precious relic of English Church offices, the\r\nService-book given to Exeter Cathedral by Bishop Leofric in the reign of\r\nEdward Conf., described in the 'Registrum Benefactorum' simply as\r\n'Missale antiquissimum.' This is happily perfect; in size a small and\r\nthick quarto volume, written on very stout vellum, and containing 377\r\nleaves. Four other volumes (possibly more) were also gifts of Leofric to\r\nhis Church; they are now numbered Auct. D. II. 16 (the four Gospels),\r\nAuct. F. I. 15 (Boethius and Persius), Auct. F. III. 6 (Prudentius), and\r\nBodley MS. 708 (Gregory's _Pastorale_.) They each contain an inscription\r\nin Latin and Anglo-Saxon, varying in expression, but all to the\r\nfollowing effect (as in the last-mentioned volume): 'Hunc librum dat\r\nLeofricus episcopus ecclesiæ Sancti Petri Apostoli in Exonia ad sedem\r\nsuam episcopalem, pro remedio animæ suæ, ad utilitatem successorum\r\nsuorum. Siquis autem illum inde abstulerit, perpetuæ maledictioni\r\nsubjaceat. Fiat. [OE: Ðas boc gef leofric ƀ. into Scē petres\r\nminstre on exancestre þær his biscopstol is. his æfterfiligendū to\r\nnittweorðnisse. [&] gif hig hwa ut ætbrede hæbbe he ece geniðerunge mid\r\neallū deoflum.] Ā[=m].' To the MS. of the Gospels are prefixed\r\nvery curious lists in Anglo-Saxon of the lands, vestments, books, &c.,\r\ngiven by Leofric to his Church, and of relics given by King Athelstan\r\n(of which another copy is preserved in the Missal); these lists are\r\nprinted in the Monasticon, and the titles of the books are given in\r\nWanley's Catalogue (p. 80).\r\n\r\nThe Library being now supplied with upwards of 2000 volumes, it was\r\nsolemnly opened on Nov. 8 (the day appointed for the annual visitation,)\r\nby the Vice-Chancellor, with a procession of doctors and delegates.\r\nMeeting them at the door of the room, the Librarian hastily extemporized\r\na short speech in honour of the occasion, 'in qua,' as the University\r\nRegister records, 'tribus ferme versibus amplexus est omnia.'\r\n\r\n[35] _Reliquiæ Bodl._ p. 92.\r\n\r\n[36] See _ibid._ pp. 137 and 219.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1603.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh appears in this year as a donor of £50. He is\r\nsometimes said to have procured for Oxford the library of Hieron.\r\nOsorius, which was carried off from Faro in Portugal (of which place\r\nOsorius had been bishop), when that town was captured by the English\r\nfleet under the Earl of Essex in 1598. Raleigh was a captain in the\r\nsquadron, and probably influenced the disposal of the books; but no\r\ndirect mention has been found of his name in relation to them. Sir\r\nWilliam Monson, in the account of the expedition given in his _Naval\r\nTracts_, only says that the library 'was brought into England by us, and\r\nmany of the books bestowed upon the new erected library of Oxford.'\r\nEleven MSS. were given by Sir Rob. Cotton, of which the list in the\r\nRegister is printed in Sir H. Ellis' _Letters of Eminent Literary Men_,\r\nissued by the Camden Society in 1843 (p. 103). One of these (Auct. D.\r\nII. 14) is the MS. of the Gospels, traditionally believed to be one of\r\nthose two copies of the old Italic version sent by St. Gregory to St.\r\nAugustine in Britain, which were preserved in St. Augustine's Abbey,\r\nCanterbury[37]; of which the other now exists among Archbp. Parker's\r\nMSS. in Corp. Chr. Coll. Cambr., No. 286. They are both written in\r\nquarto, in uncial letters and double columns. Their date may possibly be\r\nsomewhat later than that which is traditionally assigned; but at any\r\nrate they are certainly among what the historian Elmham calls 'primitiæ\r\nlibrorum totius ecclesiæ Anglicanæ.' On the last fly-leaf of the Bodley\r\nMS. is the following list of English Priests' libraries. [OE: 'Þas bocas\r\nhaueð Salomon p[=rs]t. [-þ]is þecodspel t{r}aht.

It now numbers 172 leaves, besides the\r\nfly-leaf, and contains 29 lines in a column; the Cambridge MS. has 25\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nTwo Russian MSS. were given in this year by John Mericke, English Consul\r\nin Russia, and a collection of Italian books by Sir Michael Dormer.\r\n\r\n[37] Wanley, p. 172.

F. 27.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1605.\r\n\r\nThe bust of Bodley, which is seen in the large room, was sent by\r\nSackville, Earl of Dorset, the Chancellor of the University. It\r\nattracted the notice of King James upon his entering the Library on the\r\nfourth day of his visit to Oxford in August of this year, who, upon\r\nreading its inscription, indulged in the very mild pun that the Founder\r\nshould rather be called Sir Thomas Godly than Bodly[39]. And, looking on\r\nthe well-filled cases, he said he had often had proof from the\r\nUniversity of the fruits of talent and ability, but had never before\r\nseen the garden where those fruits grew and whence they were gathered.\r\nHe examined various MSS. of the Holy Scriptures, and especially of the\r\nold English version, as well as of the Ethiopic, on the authority of\r\nwhich, 'more suo, summo cum judicio disceptavit.' Then, taking up\r\nGaguinus' treatise _De Puritate Conceptionis Virg. Mar._, printed at\r\nParis in 1498, he remarked that the author had so written about purity\r\nas if he wished that it should only be found on the title of his book;\r\nand said it had often been his desire that such objectionable writings\r\n(especially on religious subjects) could be altogether suppressed rather\r\nthan be tolerated to the corruption of minds and manners. He admitted,\r\nhowever, that probably there was no disadvantage from their being stored\r\nup in collections of this kind. Moved to a wonderful temper of\r\nliberality, the king then offered to present from all the libraries of\r\nthe royal palaces whatsoever precious and rare books Sir T. Bodley, on\r\nexamination, might choose to carry away; and promised that the grant\r\nshould be made under seal, lest any hindrance should arise. It\r\nappears[40] that this (somewhat hasty) grant was actually passed under\r\nthe Privy Seal about the beginning of November in the same year, and\r\nthat Bodley expected to carry off a great many MSS. from Whitehall.\r\nProbably the full execution of his intentions was hindered, as he\r\nhimself appears to have suspected might happen; at any rate, there is\r\nvery little in the Library that tells of having come from the royal\r\ncollections, except a few folio editions of the Fathers which once were\r\nin the possession of Hen. VIII, as his arms stamped upon the covers\r\ntestify[41], and three or four MSS. which bear like evidence of having\r\nbelonged to James I. Upon leaving the room, after spending considerable\r\ntime in its examination, the king exclaimed that were he not King James\r\nhe would be an University man; and that, were it his fate at any time to\r\nbe a captive, he would wish to be shut up, could he but have the choice,\r\nin this place as his prison, to be bound with its chains, and to consume\r\nhis days amongst its books as his fellows in captivity[42].\r\n\r\nIn this year appeared the first Catalogue of the Library, compiled by\r\nThomas James. It is a quarto volume, published by Joseph Barnes at\r\nOxford, consisting of 425 pages, with an Appendix of 230 more; the\r\nPreface is dated June 27. The book is dedicated to Henry, Prince of\r\nWales[43]. It includes both printed books and MSS. arranged\r\nalphabetically under the four classes of Theology, Medicine, Law, and\r\nArts, with lists of expositors of Holy Scripture, commentators on\r\nAristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen, and in Civil and Canon Law. The legal\r\nand medical lists were added at Bodley's special desire[44]. A\r\ncontinuation of this classified index, embracing writers on Arts and\r\nSciences, Geography and History, is to be found in Rawlinson MS.\r\n_Miscell._ 730. It was drawn up by James, after his quitting the\r\nLibrary, for the use of young students in the faculty of Arts, in order\r\nto show his continued interest in them and in the place of his old\r\noccupation. In the preface he thus describes the arrangement of his\r\nbook: 'Exhibeo, primo, libros distributos secundum facultates suas;\r\nsecundo, dissectos in minutissimas portiones vel sectiones, idque\r\nalphabetice; tertio, habetis cognitos et exploratos auctores singulos\r\nqui de singulis subjectis vel generatim vel speciatim scripserunt\r\nlibros, tractatus, epistolas; postremo, ne quid desit, habetis editiones\r\ncertas, et maxime ex parte ex pluribus selectas et meliores, cito\r\nparabiles, digitos ad pluteos et pluteorum sectiones intendendo.' This\r\nvolume came into Rawlinson's possession from Hearne, who notes in it:\r\n'This MS. came out of the study of Dr. Anthony Hall, of Queen's College,\r\nOxford, who married the widow of Dr. John Hudson, to whom this book once\r\nbelong'd.'\r\n\r\n[39] This would-be witticism is made the subject of a quatrain in the\r\n_Justa Funebria Bodlei_, p. 108.\r\n\r\n[40] _Reliquiæ Bodl._ pp. 205, 339.\r\n\r\n[41] His arms also occur in several places in a Greek MS. now numbered\r\nAuct. E. I. 15. And there is one volume among Selden's books (8^o. A.\r\n24, Art. Seld.) which appears to possess considerable interest as having\r\ncome from the library of the many-wived king. It is a fine copy of Æsop,\r\nwith the _Batrachomyomachia_, &c., printed by Froben in 1518, which may\r\nbe conjectured, from the binding, to have been a gift from Henry to Anne\r\nBoleyn. The cover is of embossed calf; on one side is the Tudor rose\r\nsupported by angels, with the sun, moon, and four stars above, encircled\r\nby the lines:--\r\n\r\n    'Hec rosa virtutis de celo missa sereno,\r\n    Eternum florens regia sceptra feret.'\r\n\r\nBelow are the initials A. H., conjoined with a knot. On the other side\r\nis a representation of the Annunciation, with the same initials\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\n[42] The account of the king's visit is given in Sir J. Wake's _Rex\r\nPlatonicus_, pp. 116-123.\r\n\r\n[43] At the suggestion of Bodley, who thought that more reward was to be\r\ngained from the prince than from the king. (_Reliquiæ Bodl._ 206.)\r\n\r\n[44] _Reliquiæ Bodl._ pp. 195, 256.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1606.\r\n\r\nChinese literature began to make its appearance even at this early date.\r\nAmong the books bought with £20 given by Lady Kath. Sandys were, 'Octo\r\nvolumina lingua Chinensi,' while two others, '_Excusa_ in regno et\r\nlingua Chinensi,' were bought, together with the donor's own 'Historie\r\nof Great Britaine,' with a gift of £5 from John Clapham.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1610.\r\n\r\nThe books having some time since begun to crowd the room provided for\r\nthem, so that James, in his Preface to the Catalogue of 1605, said there\r\nalready seemed to be more need of a Library for the books than books for\r\nthe Library, the Founder commenced in this year an extension of his\r\nbuilding. On July 16 the first stone was laid of the eastern wing, and\r\nof the Proscholium, or vestibule of the Divinity School, beneath; which\r\nwere completed by 1612, as in that year several donations were placed in\r\nthe new room[45]. An inscription in gold letters, in the front of this\r\nbuilding, commemorates Bodley's work; having become barely legible, it\r\nhas recently been restored to its pristine lustre by the care of the\r\npresent Librarian. The noble east window contains some very curious and\r\ninteresting relics in stained glass which were presented to the Library\r\n(with numerous other fragments, which adorn some of the other windows in\r\nthe Library and partly fill two of those in the Picture Gallery[46]), in\r\n1797, by Alderman William Fletcher of Oxford, a zealous local antiquary\r\nand Churchman of the good old school. The three principal fragments\r\nrepresent: 1. Henry II, stripped naked, and suffering flagellation with\r\nbirch rods, at the hands of two monks, before the shrine of Thomas à\r\nBecket. 2. The marriage (as supposed) of Henry VI with Margaret of\r\nAnjou, representing, says Dr. Rock[47], that portion of the ceremony\r\nwhich took place at the Church door; formerly in a window of Rollright\r\nChurch, Oxfordshire. There is no evidence, however, to connect this\r\nrepresentation with Henry VI, and it has been conjectured to describe\r\nhis marriage chiefly from its corresponding in some very small degree to\r\na representation of that event, formerly at Strawberry Hill, and\r\ndescribed and engraved in Walpole's _Anecdotes of Painting_, i. 36. It\r\nis probably of an earlier date. 3. The doing homage by William, King of\r\nScotland, with his abbots and barons, to Henry II in York Minster in\r\n1171. Of the first of these, two coloured engravings, and of the second,\r\none, are found in a copy of Gutch's Wood, which came to the Library from\r\nthe same donor, Alderman Fletcher, in 1818, illustrated with very\r\nnumerous and curious engravings and drawings, as well as enriched with\r\nsome MS. notes, and bound in seven large quarto volumes[48].\r\n\r\nThe large coats of arms appear to have been inserted in 1716, as in the\r\naccounts for that year we find, 'For paynted armes in the Library\r\nwindow, £5.' But one coat of arms was put up in the year 1771, (_q. v._)\r\n\r\nIt was in this year that the Library began to be enlarged with the gift\r\nof copies of all works published by the members of the Stationers'\r\nCompany, in pursuance of an agreement made with them by Bodley, which\r\nbecame the precursor of the obligations of the Copyright Acts. On Dec.\r\n12 the Company made a grant of one perfect copy of every book printed by\r\nthem, on condition that they should have liberty to borrow the books\r\nthus given, if needed for reprinting, and also to examine, collate, and\r\ncopy the books which were given by others. An order of the Star-Chamber\r\nwas made July 11, 1637, in confirmation of this grant[49]. The proposal\r\nof such an agreement emanated from the Librarian James; but in the\r\neffecting it Bodley says that he met with 'many rubs and delays[50].'\r\nAyliffe say[51] that the agreement was very well observed until about\r\n1640. He should rather have said 'about 1630,' for in that year, in a\r\npaper of notes made by the Librarian for the use of Archbishop Laud, as\r\nChancellor of the University (in which the mention of a gift of books by\r\nFetherston, a London bookseller, fixes the date), complaint is made that\r\nthe Company were very negligent in sending their books, and it is\r\nsuggested that a message from the Chancellor might quickly remedy that\r\nneglect[52]. In 1642, Verneuil, the Sub-Libraria[53], complained in the\r\nPreface to his _Nomenclator, &c_, of the neglect which had then begun;\r\nmentioning the names of several benefactors, he adds: 'These have beene\r\nmore courteous than the Stationers of London, who by indenture are bound\r\nto give the Library a copy of every booke they print.' In the Visitation\r\nOrder-Book, under the year 1695, is the following 'memorandum' by Hyde,\r\nthen Head Librarian: 'That in November, 1695, a copy of the indenture\r\nbetween Sir Thomas Bodley and the Company of Stationers, as also a copy\r\nof their By-Law to inforce their particular members to complyance, was\r\nsent up to the Master of the Company to be communicated and publicly\r\nread to the Company once every year, as is in the indenture expressed.\r\nThe originall was also some years agon carryed up and shewed to the\r\nMaster and Wardens, because some of them used to raile at the unjustness\r\nof the Act of Parliament in forcing them to give a copy of each book to\r\nthe Bodleian Library; and therefore we shewed them that we had also\r\nanother antecedent right to a copy of each book printed by any member in\r\ntheir Company. The Indenture mentions only the giving of books new\r\nprinted, but the By-law mentions books both new-printed and also\r\nreprinted with additions[54]. We have been told that Sir Thomas Bodley\r\ngave to the Company 50 pounds worth of plate when they entred into this\r\nIndenture. But its not mentioned in our counter-part. Every book is to\r\nbe delivered to the junior Warden within 10 dayes after its off from the\r\npress, and we are to appoint somebody to demand them of him. The\r\nobligation is upon every printer to give books; it were to be wished it\r\nhad been upon every proprietor; for the proprietor must give them to\r\nus.'\r\n\r\n[45] It is probably to aid given for the erection of this structure that\r\nthe following passage refers: 'To the building Bodley's Library at\r\nOxford a considerable sum was contributed by the Bishop of London, being\r\nhis share of the moneys paid into court for commutation of penance.'\r\nArchd. Hale's Notes to the _Register of Worcester_ (Camden Soc. 1855),\r\np. cxxviii. Aid was also given by the Crown, for on May 3, 1611, an\r\norder was issued by the Lord Treasurer to the officers of the woods at\r\nStow, Shotover, &c., near Oxford, to deliver to Sir T. Bodley, for\r\nenlarging the Library, the timber which was to have been employed for\r\nmaking the Thames navigable to Oxford, a work which did not proceed.\r\n(_Calendar of State Papers_, Dom.

His tomb is remarkable as exhibiting, before Architectural and\r\nEcclesiological societies had been thought of, an anticipation of better\r\ndays in monumental design than had yet appeared; a brass, upon a high\r\naltar-tomb, represents him clad in his aldermanic gown, with his hands\r\nclasped in prayer.

From the former,\r\nnow called Hindhay farm, in the parishes of Bray and Cookham, Berks, the\r\nLibrary receives an annual rent, at the present time, of about £220; the\r\nlatter, which consisted of houses situated in Distaff Lane, were sold in\r\n1853, and the produce invested in £3455 10_s._ 3 per cent. Consols.\r\n\r\nThe first book which came from the Stationers' Company, in pursuance of\r\nthe Indenture made in Dec. 1610, was an anonymous catechetical work\r\nprinted in this year by Felix Kingston for Thomas Man, entitled,\r\n'Christian Religion substantially, methodicallie, plainlie, and\r\nprofitablie treatised.' It is now numbered 4^o R. 34 Th., and a note in\r\nBodley's own handwriting records its presentation.\r\n\r\nTwenty Arabic, Persian, and other MSS., were presented by -- Pindar,\r\nConsul at Aleppo of the Company of English Merchants, whom Bodley three\r\nyears previously had requested to procure such books[55].\r\n\r\nAmong other minor matters which called forth the care of Bodley, was the\r\nproviding a bell for the purpose of giving notice when the Library was\r\nabout to be closed. After it had been placed in the Library some\r\naccident appears to have happened to it, since we read in one of his\r\nletters to James[56], 'As touching the bell, I would have it cast again,\r\nand if my friends think it good, made somewhat better.' In 1655 a\r\nbell-rope was bought at the price of 1_s._ 4_d._ Of late years, however,\r\nthe Founder's bell had altogether disappeared, and the fact of its very\r\nexistence was unknown, while a small hand-bell, suggestive of a\r\nmuffin-man, and, more recently, a hand-bell taken from a Chinese temple\r\nat Tien-tsin, and presented by Col. Rigaud, supplied its place. But in\r\nJuly, 1866, in the course of moving some boxes and rubbish buried under\r\nsome stairs, a mouldy bell of considerable size was dragged to light,\r\nwhich proved to be the missing bell of the Founder. It was immediately\r\nput by the Librarian into the hands of Messrs. White, of Appleton,\r\nBerks, who fitted it with a frame and wheel; and now, restored to a\r\nconspicuous place in the great room, it daily thunders forth an\r\nunmistakeable signal for departure. Around it, in gold letters, runs the\r\ninscription:--'Sir Thomas Bodley gave this bell, 1611.' The\r\nbell-founder's initials, W. S., are accompanied by the device of a crown\r\nbetween three bells.\r\n\r\nAnother relic of Bodley's furniture is a massy iron chest, fastened with\r\nthree locks, two of which are enormous padlocks, for the preservation of\r\nthe moneys of the Library, of which the keys used to be in the custody\r\nof the Vice-Chancellor and Proctors. This is now exhibited in the\r\nPicture Gallery, on account of the extreme beauty of the ironwork of\r\nthe locks, which covers in its intricate ramifications the whole of the\r\ninside of the lid. On the outside are painted the arms of the University\r\n(with the older motto 'Sapientiæ et Fælicitatis') and of Bodley.\r\n\r\n[55] Hearne's _Job.

It is\r\nhere printed (for the first time) from the original, preserved in the\r\nUniversity Archives, marked A. 27[57].\r\n\r\n    '_Vicesimo octavo Januarii 1611 nono regni regis Jacobi, at\r\n      Stacõners Hall, in Ave Mary Lane in London.

Griffiths, M.A.\r\n\r\n[58] Probably the son of the John Haryson who signs above.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1613.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Founder occurred on Jan. 28, after long suffering from\r\nstone, dropsy, and scurvy, for which he is said to have been mis-treated\r\nby a Dr. Hen. Atkins[59]. Two volumes of elegiac verses were thereupon\r\nissued by the University, of which one (_Bodleiomnema_) was written\r\nentirely by members of Merton College; the other (_Justa Funebria\r\nPtolemæi Oxoniensis_) by members of the University in general. In the\r\nlatter collection are Latin verses by Laud, then President of St.\r\nJohn's, and Greek verses by Isaac Casaubon. Bodley was buried (according\r\nto his desire in his will) in the chapel of his old College, Merton, on\r\nMarch 29, with all the state of a public funeral. He bequeathed the\r\ngreater part of his property for the building of the east wing of the\r\nLibrary and the completion of the Schools, appointing Sir John Bennett\r\nand Mr. William Hakewill his executors. The former, however, proved in\r\nsome measure an unfaithful steward. When prosecuted in Parliament in\r\n1621, for gross bribery in his office as Judge of the Prerogative Court,\r\nsome of Bodley's money was still remaining in his hands, and was\r\nmentioned in the charges brought against him. For the due payment of a\r\nportion of this, by annual instalments of £150, the University, on June\r\n28, 1624, accepted four bonds from him, witnessed by Thomas Coventreye,\r\nMatthew Bennet, and Henry Wigmore; only one of these appears to have\r\nbeen paid off, leaving an unpaid deficit of £450[60]. The entry of this\r\ndebt is carried on, together with the loan made to King Charles I in\r\n1642, in the Library accounts[61], from year to year up to 1782, when\r\nby order of the Curators the entries were discontinued. In the notice of\r\nthe Library contributed (as it is said) by Dr. Hudson to Ayliffe's\r\n_Ancient and Present State of Oxford_ (vol. i. p. 460), it is stated\r\nthat the Library estate falls miserably short by reason of 'the fraud of\r\nhis [Bodley's] executor, the loan of a great sum of money to Charles I\r\nin his distress, and by the fire of London,' that event, doubtless,\r\nnecessitating the rebuilding of the houses in Distaff Lane.\r\n\r\nBodley was charged by some of his contemporaries, and apparently with\r\nsome justice, with sacrificing in his will the claims of relatives and\r\nfriends too much to the interests of the Library. One Mr. John\r\nChamberlain, a friend of Bodley, whose gossiping letters to Sir Dudley\r\nCarleton, Alice Carleton, and others, are preserved in the State Paper\r\nOffice, does not spare his accusations on this head. In a letter dated\r\nFeb. 4, 1613, he says that Bodley has left legacies to great people,\r\n£7000 to the Library, and £200 to Merton College, but little to his\r\nbrothers, his old servants, his friends, or the children of his wife, by\r\nwhom he had all his wealth[62]. In another, dated June 23, 1613, he\r\nremarks that the executors cannot excuse Bodley of unthankfulness to\r\nmany of his relatives and friends, he being 'so drunk with the applause\r\nand vanitie of his librarie that he made no conscience to rob Peter to\r\npay Paul[63].' Some inferential corroboration of this is afforded by the\r\nfollowing curious paper preserved among Rawlinson's gatherings (now in a\r\nvol. numbered Rawl. MS. Miscell., 1203), being no other than a petition\r\nfor relief addressed by the grand-nephew and grand-niece of Bodley in\r\nthe year 1712 (as appears from the Library accounts) to the Heads of\r\nHouses and Curators of the Library, who appear both officially and\r\nindividually to have been very parsimonious in their response:--\r\n\r\n    'To the Worshipful Mr. Vice-Chancellor and to all heads and\r\n      governors of Colleges and Halls within the famous University of\r\n      Oxon.\r\n\r\n    'The humble petition of William Snoshill of East Lockinge in the\r\n      county of Berks, labourer, and of Jane the wife of Thomas Hatton\r\n      of Childrey in the county aforesaid, labourer, sister of the\r\n      said William Snoshill,\r\n\r\n    'Humbly sheweth,\r\n\r\n    'That your Petitioners being the grand-children of the sister of Sir\r\n    Thomas Bodley, the munificent founder of the Bodleian Library in\r\n    your University, being now reduc'd to a poor and low estate, do with\r\n    all humility make bold to represent their distrest condition to your\r\n    consideration, hoping that out of your tender pity and\r\n    commiseration, and that regard you have for the pious memory of so\r\n    great a benefactor to your University, to whom your poor Petitioners\r\n    are so nearly allied, you will be pleas'd to consider them as real\r\n    objects of your charity and compassion, and thereby you will lay an\r\n    eternal obligation on them of praying for your present and future\r\n    happiness.\r\n\r\n    'William Snoshill\r\n    'Jane Hatton.\r\n\r\n    'We, whose names are subscribed to this Petition, are well satisfied\r\n    of the truth thereof.\r\n\r\n    'Thomas Paris, rector of Childrey\r\n    'John Holmes\r\n    'John Bell, vic. of Sparsholt\r\n    'John Aldworth, rector of East Lockinge\r\n    'Ralph Kedden, M.A., vicar of Denchworth, Berks.\r\n\r\n    '(_Mem._) The Curators gave the Petitioners the sum of four pounds\r\n    out of Sir Thomas Bodley's chest. Dr. Altham, Hebrew professor, and\r\n    Dr. Hudson, Library-keeper, gave, each of them, ten shillings.'\r\n\r\nAn alphabetical catalogue was prepared in this year by James, but was\r\nnot printed. The MS, in two small hand-books, remains in the Library. It\r\nwas ordered by the Curators, at the Visitation on Nov. 13, that 6_s._\r\n8_d._ be paid quarterly to the Bedel of the Stationers' Company as a\r\ngratuity for his trouble. MSS. were received from Edw. James, B.D., who\r\nhad been a contributor already in the year 1601.\r\n\r\n[59] _Calendar of State Papers_, 1611-18, p. 137.\r\n\r\n[60] A full account of Bennet's defalcations is given by B. Twyne, from\r\nthe University Registers, in vol. vi. (pp. 120-4) of his _Collectanea_,\r\nnow in the Univ. Archives. See also _Parliam. Hist._ vol. v. p. 462.\r\n\r\n[61] These accounts, as now preserved, unfortunately only commence at\r\nthe year 1653, and there is a hiatus from 1661 to 1676, both inclusive.\r\n\r\n[62] _Calendar of State Papers_, 1611-18, p. 169.\r\n\r\n[63] _Ibid._ p. 187.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1614.\r\n\r\nVarious orders were made by the Curators at the Visitation on Nov. 10,\r\nwhich are prefixed to the small MS. 'hand-catalogues' made at that time\r\nfor the use of those authorities. They resolve that the catalogues of\r\nnewly-published works issued at Frankfort in each spring and summer\r\nshall be examined by them within one week after their arrival. They make\r\nan attempt to obtain possession of a gift of the Founder's giving, which\r\nhad never yet reached the place of its intended deposit. In 1609 it had\r\nbeen reported to Convocation that there was about to be sent to the\r\nLibrary by Sir T. Bodley 'toga ex lana agni Tartarici ζωοφυτον,\r\nmagni quidam valoris, ei data (ut in publica Bibliotheca conservetur) ab\r\nRichardo Lee, milite, qui eandem dono recepit ab augustissimo Imperatore\r\nMuscoviæ[64].' But the precious cloak had never yet arrived; the\r\nCurators therefore resolve 'quod literæ scribantur ad exequutores domini\r\nFundatoris pro illo pretioso pallio ex zoophyto confecto, et legato ad\r\nnos per Ric. Leigh, militem, olim legatum apud Imperatorem Russiæ, et\r\nquod in cista ex ligno bene olenti, ad eam finem comparanda, reponatur\r\nin archivis, munita sera affabre facta; clavis permaneat semper apud\r\nVice-Cancellarium vel ejus deputatum, nec cuiquam illud inspiciendi vel\r\ncontrectandi potestas esto, nisi in præsentia eorundem.' At this\r\nVisitation Joseph Barnes, the Oxford printer, appeared and promised to\r\ngive a copy of every book which he might print. Complaint was made that\r\nthe London Stationers had already begun to fail in the fulfilment of\r\ntheir agreement.\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 29 the King visited the Library on his way to Woodstock, and,\r\nasking for Fulke's _Annotations on the Rhemish New Test._, pointed out\r\nthe remarks at Rom. x. 15, on the calling of ministers; 'deprehendit\r\ncalumnias et imposturas quorundam pontificiorum de ordine et vocatione\r\nministrorum[65].' In 1620 the editions of 1601 and 1617 of these\r\n_Annotations_ were both in the Library, as appears from the Catalogue of\r\nthat year, but in Hyde's Catalogue, published in 1674, only the edition\r\nof 1633 is found. This is one out of various instances which prove that,\r\nby a great miscalculation of literary value, later editions of a\r\nwriter's works were thought to supersede so entirely the earlier, that\r\nthe latter could be advantageously parted with. The Library has,\r\nhowever, since become re-possessed of the earlier editions, that of 1601\r\nhaving been presented in 1824, and that of 1617 having been bought more\r\nrecently. But the most remarkable example of this mistaken alienation of\r\nbooks occurs with reference to the first folio edition of Shakespeare.\r\nIn the Supplemental Catalogue of 1635, the folio of 1623 duly appears;\r\nbut in the Catalogue of 1674 we find only the third edition, that of\r\n1664, which doubtless had been thought to be sufficient as well as best;\r\nupon its arrival, therefore, from Stationers' Hall, the precious volume\r\nof 1623 was probably regarded as little more than waste-paper. Nor was\r\nit until the year 1821, when Malone's collection was received, that a\r\ncopy was again possessed by the Library[66].\r\n\r\n[64] 'Reg. Conv. K. f. 43,' MS. note by Dr. P. Bliss. Bodley mentions in\r\na letter to James his expectation of exhibiting the 'lamb's-wool-gown'\r\nto the King. _Reliqq. Bodl._ 173. An account of this marvellous garment\r\nwill be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[65] Wood's _Hist._ vol. ii. p. 319.\r\n\r\n[66] The extraordinary _fancy_ prices sometimes given for books, and\r\ntheir variations, are particularly exemplified in the case of the first\r\nfolio Shakespeare. In 1778 Stevens said it was 'usually valued at seven\r\nor eight' guineas. (_Shakespeare_, second edit. vol. i. p. 239.) At the\r\nRoxburghe sale (a sufficiently bibliomaniacal one) in 1812 a copy was\r\nsold for £100; in 1864 Miss Burdett Coutts gave for Mr. G. Daniel's\r\nspecially fine copy, £716 2_s._; while in July, 1867, a copy belonging\r\nto a Mr. -- Smith was sold for £410. In Dec. 1867 another copy was on\r\nsale at Mr. Beet's, the bookseller, to which the owner very discreetly\r\nattached in his catalogue no specific sum.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1615.\r\n\r\nRichard Connock, auditor and solicitor to Prince Henry of Wales, gave a\r\nMS. book of _Horæ_[67], which had formerly belonged to Mary I, and\r\nafterwards to Prince Henry. The donor, in a note prefixed, records that\r\nhe gives the volume, 'not for the religion it contains, but for the\r\npictures and former royall owners' sake.' It is a volume of the early\r\npart of the fifteenth century, in small quarto, containing 224 leaves,\r\nand ornamented with very beautiful illuminated borders and exquisite\r\ndrawings in _camaieu gris_. Among these is one of the martyrdom of\r\nBecket, which, doubtless in consequence of the book being in the\r\npossession of the Princess Mary, has entirely escaped the defacement and\r\nobliteration ordered by her father to be made in all Service-books where\r\nthe office for S. Thomas of Canterbury occurred. The following\r\ninscription (nearly effaced at its close by over-much handling in former\r\nyears), addressed by Mary to one of her ladies, whose name does not\r\nappear, to whom probably she presented the book, occurs in the blank\r\nportion of one of the leaves:--\r\n\r\n    'Geate you such riches as when the shype is broken, may swyme away\r\n    wythe the Master. For dyverse chances take away the goods of\r\n    fortune; but the goods of the soule whyche bee only the trewe goods,\r\n    nother fyer nor water can take away. Yf you take labour and payne to\r\n    doo a vertuous thyng, the labour goeth away, and the vertue\r\n    remaynethe. Yf through pleasure you do any vicious thyng, the\r\n    pleasure goeth away and the vice remaynethe. Good Madame, for my\r\n    sake remembre thys.\r\n\r\n                                'Your lovyng mystres,\r\n                                          'Marye Princesse.'\r\n\r\nThis inscription (which does so much credit to its writer) was first\r\nprinted by Hearne at the end of _Titi Livii Forojulien. Vita Hen. V._\r\n(p. 228) and last, in Bliss' _Reliquiæ Hearn._ i. 105. Mr. Coxe has\r\nnoted (from _Alstedii Systema Mnemonicum_, 1610, i. 705) that the latter\r\npart is taken directly and literally from Musonius, while indirectly it\r\ncomes from an oration by Cato[68]. Probably the first part may be traced\r\nto some similar source.\r\n\r\nAnother autograph inscription by Mary while Princess is found in a small\r\nbook (Laud MS. Miscell. i.) of private prayers in Latin and English,\r\nwhich belonged to Jane Wriothesley, wife of Thomas Earl of Southampton,\r\nand which she seems to have employed as a kind of album. At f. 45^a are\r\nthese lines, which appear to form a triplet, although not written in\r\nmetrical form by the Princess:--\r\n\r\n    'Good Madame, I do desyer you most hartly to pray,\r\n    That in prosperyte and adversyte I may\r\n    Have grace to keep the trewe way.\r\n\r\n                                'Your lovyng frend,\r\n                                          to my ... [power?]'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the conclusion, with the signature, has been cut off. A\r\ncouplet, signed by Queen Katherine Parr, has an equal, and most regal,\r\ndisregard of the restraints of metrical rhythm (f. 8^b.):--\r\n\r\n    'Madam, althowe I have differred writtyng in your booke,\r\n    I am no lesse your frend than you do looke.\r\n\r\n                                'Kateryn the Quene KP.'\r\n\r\nOther inscriptions are inserted by Margaret Queen of Scotland, Mary\r\nCountess of Lennox and mother of Lord Darnley, and by the Countess of\r\nSouthampton's daughters, Elizabeth, Mary, and Anne.\r\n\r\nJames Button, Esq., of the county of Worcester, gave, on March 28, a\r\ncurious relic of the ancient language of Cornwall, being three\r\nMiracle-Plays of the Creation, the Passion, and the Resurrection, in\r\nCornish, contained in a MS. on vellum, small folio, eighty-three leaves,\r\nwritten in the fifteenth century; now numbered Bodl. 791. A copy on\r\npaper of the Play of the Creation, written by John Jordan in 1611, is\r\nalso in the Library, numbered Bodl. 219, which appears to have come from\r\nthe library of King James I, having the royal crown stamped on the\r\nparchment cover, with the initials I.K. A second modern copy has also\r\nbeen recently presented (in 1849) by Edwin Ley, Esq., of Bosahan,\r\nCornwall, which is accompanied by a translation by John Keigwyn, made in\r\n1695. The dramas were printed in two volumes at the University Press,\r\nwith a translation, notes, and glossary, by Mr. Edwin Norris, in 1859.\r\n\r\nSome MSS. were given about this time by the three sons of Rich. Colf,\r\nD.D., and in 1618 twenty Greek volumes by Cecil, Earl of Exeter.\r\n\r\n[67] The gift is omitted in the Benefaction-Register, apparently because\r\nit was a rule not to record donations of single volumes [_Reliquiæ\r\nBodl._ pp. 91, 283]; consequently several books of the greatest value\r\nare omitted.\r\n\r\n[68] George Herbert expresses the same idea at the end of his _Church\r\nPorch_:--\r\n\r\n    'If thou do ill, the joy fades, not the pains;\r\n    If well, the pain doth fade, the joy remains.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1620.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of May, James resigned the office of Librarian, but not\r\nas Wood says, on account of his promotion to the Subdeanery of Wells,\r\nsince that took place in the year 1614. His appointment to the rectory\r\nof Mongeham, Kent (also mentioned by Wood), was in 1617. He continued,\r\nhowever, to reside in Oxford, and dying there in August, 1629, was\r\nburied in New College Chapel.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of the same month of May, John Rouse, M.A., Fellow of Oriel,\r\nwas elected James' successor. No account of him is given by Wood,\r\npossibly from dislike of his Puritanical principles, and of his\r\ncontinuing to hold office during the usurpation. He appears to have\r\ndischarged his trust in the Library with faithfulness, and, at least, to\r\nhave deserved some mention at the historiographer's hands for the\r\nAppendix to the Catalogue which he issued in the year 1635 (_q.v._)[69]\r\nHe is best known as the friend of Milton, who, on Rouse's application to\r\nhim for a copy of his _Poems both English and Latin_, published in 1645,\r\nin the place of one previously given by Milton which had been lost, sent\r\nthe volume, together with a long autograph Latin Ode, dated Jan. 23,\r\n1646 (-7), and bearing the following title: 'Ad Joannem Rousium,\r\nOxoniensis Academiæ Bibliothecarium, de libro poematum amisso quem ille\r\nsibi denuo mitti postulabat, ut cum aliis nostris in Bibliotheca publica\r\nreponeret, Ode Joannis Miltonj[70].' The volume is now numbered 8^o. M.\r\n168 Art. A facsimile of a considerable portion of the Ode (which Cowper\r\ntranslated into English, and which is said to have been the last of\r\nMilton's Latin poetical effusions) is given in plate xvii. of Sam. Leigh\r\nSotheby's sumptuous volume, entitled _Ramblings in the Elucidation of\r\nthe Autograph of Milton_, 4^o. Lond. 1861; and at p. 120 there is a\r\nfacsimile in full of Milton's inscription in another volume (4^o. F. 56\r\nTh.) which contains a collection of the political and polemical\r\ntreatises published by him in the years 1641-5. This latter inscription,\r\nwhich gives a list of the contents of the volume, is addressed as\r\nfollows: 'Doctissimo viro proboque librorum æstimatori Joanni Rousio,\r\nOxoniensis academiæ Bibliothecario, gratum hoc sibi fore testanti,\r\nJoannes Miltonius opuscula hæc sua in Bibliothecam antiquissimam atque\r\nceleberrimam adsciscenda libens tradit, tanquam in memoriæ perpetuæ\r\nFanum, emeritamque, uti sperat, invidiæ calumniæque vacationem; si\r\nVeritati, Bonoque simul Eventui satis litatum sit.' Warton tells the\r\nalmost incredible story, in his edition of Milton's _Poems_, that about\r\nthe year 1720 these two volumes were thrown out into a heap of\r\nduplicates, from which Nathaniel Crynes, who afterwards bequeathed his\r\nown collection to the Library[71], was permitted to pick out what he\r\npleased for himself; fortunately, however, he was too good a royalist\r\nand churchman to choose anything that bore the name of Milton, and so\r\nthe books, despised and rejected on both sides, by mere chance remained\r\nin the place of their original deposit! Such an incident, if true, goes\r\nfar to justify the charges of ignorance and neglect of the Library which\r\nHearne in his Diary constantly brings against Hudson, the Librarian at\r\nthat time, and those whom he employed.\r\n\r\nThe second edition of the Catalogue was issued by James, shortly after\r\nhis resignation of his office, with a Dedication to Prince Charles, and\r\na Preface dated June 30. It consists of 539 quarto pages, in double\r\ncolumns. It abandons the classified arrangement of the former Catalogue,\r\nand adopts that (followed ever since) of one alphabet of names. James,\r\nin his Preface, gives as his reason for this course, the frequent\r\ndifficulty (already experienced even in so small a collection) of\r\ndeciding to what class a book should be assigned, and the inconvenience\r\nresulting from division of the works of the same author. He points out\r\nthe value of the Library to foreigners, who can there consult 16,000\r\nvolumes for six hours a day, excepting Sundays and holidays[72]. As\r\ninstances of the copiousness of its stores, he mentions that there are\r\nto be found above 100 folio and quarto volumes on Military Art, in\r\nGreek, Latin, and other languages; and that there are 3000 or 4000 books\r\nin French, Italian, and Spanish. He notes that heretical and\r\nschismatical books are not to be read without leave of the\r\nVice-Chancellor and Regius Professor of Divinity; and makes some remarks\r\non the method of keeping a Common-place-book. He gives as the reason for\r\nhis quitting his post, his severe sufferings from stone and\r\nparalysis[73].\r\n\r\nOn June 4, King James presented the folio edition of his _Works_ as\r\nedited by Bishop Montague. The book (now marked B. 14. 17. Theol.)\r\ncontains the following presentation inscription, written and signed by\r\nSir R. Naunton:--\r\n\r\n'Jacobus Dei gratia Magnæ Britanniæ, Franciæ et Hiberniæ Rex, fidei\r\ndefensor, &c. Postquam decrevisset publici juris facere quæ sibi erat\r\ncommentatus, ne videretur vel palam pudere literarum quas privatim\r\namaverat, vel eorum seu opinioni seu invidiæ cedere qui Regis Majestatem\r\nliteris dictitabant imminui, vel Christiani Orbis et in eo Principum\r\njudicia expavescere, quorum maxime intererat vera esse omnia quæ\r\nscripsit; circumspicere etiam cœpit certum aliquod libro suo\r\ndomicilium, locum, si fieri possit, semotum a fato, æternitati et paci\r\nsacrum. Ecce commodum sua se obtulit Academia, illa pæne orbi notior\r\nquam Cantabrigiæ, ubi exulibus Musis jam olim melius est quam in patria,\r\nubi a codicibus famæ nuncupatis tineæ absterrentur legentium manibus,\r\nsycophantæ scribentium ingeniis. In hoc immortali literarum sacrario,\r\ninter monumenta clarorum virorum, quos quantum dilexit studiorum\r\nparticipatione satis indicavit, in bibliotheca publica, lucubrationes\r\nhas suas Deo Opt. Max., Cui ab initio devotæ erant, æternum consecrat,\r\nin venerando Almæ Matris sinu, unde contra seculorum rubiginem fidam\r\nilli custodiam promittit, et contra veritatis hostes stabile\r\npatrocinium.'\r\n\r\nThe book, which was carried to Oxford by a special deputation,\r\nconsisting of Patrick Young, the Librarian at St. James's (to whom £20\r\nwas given by the University for his pains), and others, was received by\r\nthe University with great ceremony. A Convocation was held in St. Mary's\r\nChurch, on May 29, at which an oration was delivered by Rich. Gardiner,\r\nthe Deputy-Orator, and at which a letter of thanks was approved (which\r\nis printed in Wood's _Annals_, ii. 336); from thence the\r\nVice-Chancellor, attended by 24 doctors in their scarlet robes, and a\r\nmixed multitude of others, carried it in solemn procession to the\r\nLibrary, where the keeper, Rouse, 'made a verie prettie speech,' says\r\nPatrick Young, 'and placed it _in archivis_ ... with a great deale of\r\nrespect[74].' The King was greatly pleased with the formality and\r\nflattery with which his works were received, and the more so 'because\r\nCambridge received them without extraordinary respect[75].'\r\n\r\nAnother gift in this year, presented by Thomas Nevile, K.B., eldest son\r\nof Sir H. Nevile, Knt., is thus described in the Register:\r\n'Elegantissimum libellum diversa scripturæ genera continentem, manu\r\nEsteris Anglicæ, characteribus exquisitis conscriptum.' This is,\r\ndoubtless, the MS. of the Book of Proverbs, dated 1599, in which every\r\nchapter, as well as the dedication to the Earl of Essex, is written in a\r\ndifferent style of caligraphy, which is now exhibited in the glass case\r\nnearest the entrance to the Library. It is an extremely beautiful\r\nspecimen of the handiwork of Mrs. Esther Inglis, of whose skill the\r\nLibrary possesses another and smaller specimen (Bodl. 987), consisting\r\nof some French verses by Guy de Faur, Sieur de Pybrac, written for Dr.\r\nJoseph Hall (afterwards the Bishop of Norwich), in 1617. These are\r\ndescribed in the account of Mrs. Inglis, in Ballard's _Memoirs of\r\nBritish Ladies_. A third specimen of her work is in the Library of Ch.\r\nCh.: it is a Psalter in French, presented to Queen Elizabeth in 1599,\r\nbound in embroidered crimson velvet, set with pearls[76].\r\n\r\nThe Douay Bible of 1609 was presented by Sir Rich. Anderson, and a\r\nPersian MS. of the Liturgy of the Greek Church by Sir Thos. Roe. The\r\nfirst architectural model also was given in this year; but unfortunately\r\nit is not now extant. Its description is as follows: 'Clemens Edmonds,\r\neques auratus, consilio Regis ab epistolis, donavit egregium παραδειγμα\r\nquinque columnarum, nunc primum inventum, secundum formam rusticam, ex\r\nalabastrite singulari artificio confectum.'\r\n\r\n[69] One fact to his credit is indeed mentioned by Wood in the _Fasti_,\r\nunder the year 1648, viz. that he prevented the then Vice-Chancellor,\r\nDr. Reynolds, and the Proctors from breaking open Bodley's chest in\r\nsearch of money, by assuring them that there was nothing in it. Hearne\r\n(_MS. Diary_, vol. xii. p. 13) says that Rouse inserted a portrait of\r\nSir Thos. Bodley, done at his own charge, in the window of the room\r\nwhich he occupied on the west side of Oriel College.\r\n\r\n[70] Cowley followed Milton's example by inserting an Ode, in this case\r\nin English, in a folio copy of his _Poems_ (numbered C. 2. 21. Art.),\r\nwhich he gave June 26, 1656. It is printed exactly from the original in\r\n_Reliquiæ Hearn._ ii. 921-3.\r\n\r\n[71] See _sub anno_ 1745.\r\n\r\n[72] At this time there were only two other public libraries in Europe,\r\nboth later in date than the Bodleian, viz. that of Angelo Rocca at Rome,\r\nopened in 1604, and the Ambrosian at Milan, opened in 1609. The fourth\r\npublic library was that of Card. Mazarin at Paris, opened in 1643.\r\nEvidence of the consequent appreciation by foreigners of the advantages\r\nof the Bodleian Library is given under the year 1641.\r\n\r\n[73] An Appendix to James' Catalogue was printed in 1635, _q. v._\r\n\r\n[74] Nichols' _Progresses of James I_, vol. iii. p. 1105. Rouse's speech\r\n(with the letter) is printed in Hearne's _Titus Liv. Forojul._ p. 198.\r\n\r\n[75] Letter from J. Chamberlain to Sir D. Carleton, June 28, 1620:\r\n_Calendar of State Papers, 1619-23_, p. 157.\r\n\r\n[76] An account of Mrs. Esther Inglis, and of all her known existing\r\nMSS., is preparing for publication by David Laing, Esq., LL.D., of\r\nEdinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1621.\r\n\r\nA gift of £5 is noticeable as coming from the Girdlers' Company,\r\n'Societas Zonariorum.' Sir Francis Bacon occurs as a donor of books.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1623.\r\n\r\nDelegates were appointed by Convocation to consider 'de modulo\r\nfrontispicii Bibliothecæ publicæ in parte occidentali versus collegium\r\nExon[77].'\r\n\r\n[77] Reg. Conv. N. ff. 167, 169.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1624.\r\n\r\n'Williams, Bishop of Lincoln, and then Lord Chancellor of England, would\r\nhave borrowed Paulus Benius Eugubinus _De dirimend. Controvers. de Grat.\r\net Lib. Arb._, but was deny'd[78].'\r\n\r\nThe first theft of a book from the Library occurred in this year. An\r\naccount of it, with several others, will be found in a note to the year\r\n1654.\r\n\r\n[78] Barlow's MS. Arg. against lending books out of the Library; see\r\n_post, sub anno_ 1659.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1627.\r\n\r\nAndrew James, of Newport, Isle of Wight, is recorded to have given 'duas\r\ncapsulas in quibus asservantur scripta vetustissima, exotici et ignoti\r\ncharacteris, alia stylo, calamo alia, in corticibus exarata, ex\r\norientalis Indiæ partibus allata[79].' An East India merchant, John\r\nJourdain, gave four Arabic MSS., and Bacon's _Works_ were presented by\r\nPeter Ince, a bookseller at Chester. It appears from the Register that\r\nJoseph Barnes, the Oxford printer and publisher, died in this year, as\r\nhe bequeathed a legacy of £5.\r\n\r\n[79] At the end of the Barocci collection (numbered 245, 246, in the\r\nCatalogue of 1697) are two Javanese MSS., written on palm-leaves: the\r\none written with a reed in the sacred or Pali character, preserved in a\r\nbox; the other written with a style in the common character, and having\r\nthe leaves tied together in the usual manner between two boards. As\r\nthere does not seem to be any evidence for supposing that Barocci's\r\ncollection included any Oriental MSS., it is possible that these were\r\nthe writings 'ignotis characteris' given two years previously by Andr.\r\nJames.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1628.\r\n\r\nTwenty-nine MSS., all of which, except three, are Greek, were given by\r\nSir Thomas Roe, who had previously been ambassador in Turkey, and who\r\nafterwards sat, at the commencement of the Long Parliament, as Burgess\r\nfor the University, in company with Selden. One of the three exceptions\r\nis an original copy of the Synodal Epistles of the Council of Basle,\r\nwith the leaden seal attached; and another, a valuable Arabic MS. of the\r\nApostolic Canons, &c., which is noticed at length by Selden in the second\r\nbook of his treatise, _De Synedriis Hebræorum_. Roe proposed that his\r\nbooks should be permitted to be lent out for purposes of printing, on\r\nproper security being given; a proposition which was accepted by\r\nConvocation[80]. Special licence of borrowing Lord Pembroke's (the\r\nBarocci) and Roe's MSS. was granted by the donors themselves to Dr.\r\nLindsell (afterwards Bishop of Peterborough and Hereford) and Patrick\r\nYoung, the keeper of the King's Library at St. James's. The latter is\r\nfound, from the Register of Readers, to have used his privilege as late\r\nas Feb. and March, 1647-8, various volumes of Pembroke's MSS. being then\r\nlent to him, together with some marked 'Archbp.', which were doubtless\r\nLaud's[81].\r\n\r\nThe copy of Bacon's _Essays_ (1625) which was presented by the author to\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham, was given to the Library by Lewis Roberts, a\r\nmerchant of London. It is now exhibited among the curiosities in the\r\nfirst glass case, as a specimen of binding, being clad in green velvet,\r\nembroidered with gold and silver thread, with the head of the duke\r\nworked in silk. The same donor also presented the copy of Bishop\r\nWilliams' Funeral Sermon on James I, which had been given to the same\r\nduke by the author. Several other specimens of embroidered bindings are\r\npreserved in the Library, which are all, it is believed, comprehended in\r\nthe following list[82]:--\r\n\r\n1. A part of L. Tomson's version of the New Test., printed by Barker, in\r\n16^o (in 1578?), now marked MS. _e Musæo_, 242. This belonged to Queen\r\nElizabeth, and is bound in a covering worked by herself, with various\r\nmottos, _e.g._ 'Celum patria,' 'Scopus vitæ Xpũs,' &c. And on a\r\nfly-leaf occurs this note in her handwriting: 'August[ine?]. I walke\r\nmanie times into the pleasant fieldes of the Holye Scriptures, where I\r\nplucke up the goodlie greene herbes of sentences by pruning, eate them\r\nby reading, chawe them by musing, and laie them up at length in the hie\r\nseate of memorie by gathering them together; that so hauing tasted thy\r\nsweetenes I may the lesse perceave the bitternes of this miserable\r\nlife[83].'\r\n\r\n2. Another of Elizabeth's bibliopegic achievements is the cover of her\r\nown translation from the French of _The Miroir or Glasse of the\r\nsynnefull Soule_, executed when only eleven years old. She says that she\r\ntranslated it 'out of frenche ryme into englishe prose, joyning the\r\nsentences together as well as the capacitie of my symple witte and small\r\nlerning coulde extende themselves;' and prefixes a dedication, dated\r\n'from Assherige, the laste daye of the yeare of our Lord God, 1544,' in\r\nwhich, 'to our moste noble and vertuous quene Katherin, Elizabeth her\r\nhumble daughter wisheth perpetuall felicitie and everlasting ioye.' The\r\nvolume consists of 63 small quarto leaves, and has the queen's initials\r\nK. P. embroidered within an ornamental border of gold and silver thread,\r\non a ground of blue corded silk. It is numbered Cherry MS. 38.\r\n\r\n3. _Dialogue de la Vie et de la Mort_, trans. from the Italian by J.\r\nLouveau, and printed in imitation of MS., second edit., 12^o. Lyon,\r\n1558. Red velvet, embroidered with gold and silver thread. A French\r\ninscription on a fly-leaf is in a handwriting resembling that of Queen\r\nElizabeth. Bodl. MS., 660.\r\n\r\n4. A Testament in 16^o, printed by Norton and Bill in 1625. Very thick\r\nand clumsy embroidery: on one side, David, in a flowing wig, playing on\r\nthe harp, with a dog, dragon-fly, &c; on the other, Abraham, in a\r\nsimilar wig and with a falling collar, stopped in the sacrifice of his\r\nson. There is a tradition that this formed part of a waistcoat of\r\nCharles I; but it is not known on what evidence it rests, nor does the\r\nmaterial seem likely to have been so employed. In the Douce collection.\r\nExhibited in the glass case at the entrance of the Library.\r\n\r\n5. Bible, 8^o Lond. 1639. Landscape, &c., worked in silk, with embroidery\r\nin gold and silver thread. Arch Bodl. D subt. 75.\r\n\r\n6. Prayer-book, New Test., and Metrical Psalms, 1630-1, bound by the\r\nnuns of Little Gidding. Exhibited in the glass case. Bought in 1866 for\r\n£10[84].\r\n\r\n7. New Testament, printed at Cambridge in 1628, in 16^mo. This was the\r\nfirst edition printed there of any portion of the Authorized Version,\r\nand only the second of any English translation[85]. The binding of the\r\nLibrary copy (which was bought, in 1859, for five guineas) is covered\r\nwith silver filigree work.\r\n\r\nAmong Dr. Rawlinson's multifarious collections is a volume of curious\r\nearly specimens of worked samplers, humorously lettered on the back,\r\n'Works of Learned Ladies.'\r\n\r\n[80] 'Reg. Conv. R. 1628. f. 6.' MS. note by Dr. P. Bliss.\r\n\r\n[81] See _sub anno_ 1635.\r\n\r\n[82] A lady, whose name is not mentioned, but who is graced with the\r\nappellation of 'heroina,' is recorded to have given to the University\r\nthe Life of our Blessed Lord depicted in needle-work, 'byssina et aurata\r\ntextura,' which was duly presented in Convocation on July 9, 1636. [Reg.\r\nConv. R. 24.] It is not now preserved in the Library.\r\n\r\n[83] This note is printed and the book described in Hearne's Appendix to\r\n_Titi Livii Forojul. Vit. Hen. V_, and, from thence, in Ballard's\r\n_Lives_; but not very correctly in either case. Also in Bliss' _Reliqq.\r\nHearn._ i. 104.\r\n\r\n[84] In the life of Rich. Ferrar, junior, in Wordsworth's _Eccl. Biogr._\r\n(third edit. vol. iv. p. 232) a note is quoted from a MS. stating that a\r\ncopy of Ferrar's _Whole Law of God_, bound by the nuns of Gidding in\r\ngreen velvet, was given to the University Library by Archbp. Laud. This\r\nis a mistake; the book in question was given by the Archbishop to the\r\nlibrary of his own college, St. John's, where it still remains.\r\n\r\n[85] The first was the Genevan Version, printed in 1591.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1629.\r\n\r\nThe extremely valuable series of Greek MSS., called from its collector\r\nthe Barocci Collection, comprising 242 volumes, was presented by Will.\r\nHerbert, Earl of Pembroke, and Chancellor of the University. The manner\r\nof its acquisition is recorded in Archbp. Usher's correspondence. In a\r\nletter from Dublin of Jan. 22, 1628-9, Usher says: 'That famous library\r\nof Giacomo Barocci, a gentleman of Venice, consisting of 242 manuscript\r\nvolumes, is now brought into England by Mr. Featherstone the\r\nstationer[86].' He recommended that the King should buy it, and add to\r\nit the collection of Arabic MSS. which the Duke of Buckingham had bought\r\nof the heirs of Erpenius[87]. On April 13, 1629, Sir H. Bourgchier\r\nwriting to Usher, tells him that the Earl of Pembroke has bought the\r\ncollection, for the University of Oxford, at the price of £700, and that\r\nit consists of 250 volumes[88]. It was forwarded to the University with\r\nthe following letter, which is here copied from the Convocation\r\nRegister, R. 24 (f. 9^b.):--\r\n\r\n    'Good Mr. Vice-Chancelor,\r\n\r\n    'Understanding of an excellent collection of Greke manuscripts\r\n    brought from Venice, and thincking that they would bee of more use\r\n    to the Church in being kept united in some publick Librarye then\r\n    scattered in particular hands; remembring the obligation I had to my\r\n    mother the Universitie, first for breeding mee, after for the honor\r\n    they did mee in making mee their Chancelor, I was glad of this\r\n    occasion to repay some part of that great debt I owe her. And\r\n    therefore I sent you downe the collection entire, which I pray\r\n    present with my beste love to the Convocation house. And I shall\r\n    unfaynedly remaine,\r\n\r\n                      'Your most assured freind,\r\n                                          'PEMBROKE.\r\n  'Greenewich, the 25th of May, 1629.'\r\n\r\nThe Earl was willing that the MSS. should, if necessary, be allowed to\r\nbe borrowed. And, in pursuance of this expressed wish, Patrick Young\r\nhad, in 1648, the use of various MSS. from this collection, as we find\r\nfrom a memorandum at the end of the Register of Readers in 1648-9. But\r\none MS. suffered in consequence considerable injury[89]. A further\r\nportion of the collection (consisting of 22 Greek MSS. and 2 Russian),\r\nwhich had been retained by the Earl, was subsequently purchased by\r\nOliver Cromwell, and given by him to the Library in 1654. There they\r\nstill bear the Protector's name; but, strange to say, no entry of the\r\ngift appears in the Benefaction Book[90]. These are all fully described\r\nin the first volume of the general Catalogue of MSS., published by Rev.\r\nH. O. Coxe in 1853. A Catalogue of the Barocci and Roe MSS., by Dr.\r\nPeter Turner, of Merton College, beautifully written, filling 38 folio\r\nleaves, is bound up among Selden's printed books, marked AA. 1. Med.\r\nSeld.\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 27, the Library was visited for the first time by King Charles\r\nand his Queen, little anticipating under what circumstances that visit\r\nwould be repeated. He was received with an oration by the Public Orator,\r\nStrode, a copy of which is preserved in Smith MS. xxvi. 26, and which,\r\nin the exaggerated style of the Court-adulation of the time, began with\r\nwords that sound blasphemously in our ears, '_Excellentissime\r\nVice-Deus_.' From the Library the King ascended to the leads of the\r\nSchools; and there discussed the proposed removal of some mean houses in\r\nCat Street, which then intervened between the Schools and St. Mary's\r\nChurch. A plan of the ground and buildings was made at his desire, which\r\nwas sent up to him at London.\r\n\r\n[86] In the following year Mr. Henry Featherstone, bookseller in London,\r\ngave to the Library a number of Hebrew books.\r\n\r\n[87] Parr's _Life of Usher_, Letters, p. 400.\r\n\r\n[88] _Ibid._ Quoted in Sir H. Ellis' _Letters of Eminent Literary Men_,\r\nCamden Soc., 1843. p. 130.\r\n\r\n[89] See _sub anno_ 1654.\r\n\r\n[90] Richard Cromwell proposed at one time to perpetuate his own name in\r\nthe Library, together with his father's, by sending a collection of the\r\naddresses which had been made to him, in order to show the temper of the\r\nnation, and the readiness of the greatest persons 'to compliment people\r\non purpose for secular interest.' _Reliquiæ Hearn._ i. 263.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1631.\r\n\r\nCharles Robson, B.D., of Queen's College, who had been Chaplain to the\r\nMerchants at Aleppo, gave a fine Syriac MS. of the Four Gospels, which\r\nhe had brought from the East; it is now numbered Bodl. Orient. 361.\r\nAnother MS. of his gift has been by some mistake placed amongst the\r\nThurston MSS., No. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1632.\r\n\r\nWilliam Burton, the historian of Leicestershire, gave the original MSS.\r\nof Leland's _Itinerary_ (together with a transcript of some parts) and\r\nof his _Collectanea_; the former filling seven volumes in quarto[91],\r\nand the latter (including the book _De Scriptoribus Britannicis_) four\r\nin folio. The _Collectanea_, after the death of Leland, had been in the\r\npossession of Sir John Cheke, to whom Edward VI entrusted the custody of\r\nLeland's papers; on his going into exile in the reign of Queen Mary, he\r\ngave them to Humphrey Purefoy, Esq., whose son, Thomas Purefoy,\r\npresented them to Burton in the year 1612. The _Itinerary_ was first\r\npublished by Hearne in 1710, in 9 vols.; the _Collectanea_ in 1715, in 6\r\nvols.; the _De Scriptoribus_, by Ant. Hall, in 1709. The MS. of the\r\n_Itinerary_ is much stained and injured by damp; but it is no longer in\r\nthe perishable condition described by Hearne. There are, besides, three\r\ntranscripts of it in the Library; one, of part of the book (Bodl. 470)\r\nis a copy (mentioned above) which was made for Burton, and sent by him\r\nto Rouse, with a letter dated 'Lindley, Leic. 17 July, 1632,' in which\r\nhe describes it as being 'written, though not with so fine a letter, yet\r\nwith a judicious hand.' He says that another part is 'now (as I heere)\r\nin the hands of Doctor Burton, Archdeacon of Gloucester, which he\r\nreceived by loane from a freind of mine, but never yet restored; the\r\nwhich, I thinke, upon request he will impart unto you;' and adds, 'Some\r\nmore partes there were of this _Itinerary_, but through the negligence\r\nof him to whom they were first lent, are embesiled and gone.' He\r\nundertakes to send the three parts of the _Collectanea_ and the book _De\r\nScriptt. Angliæ_, according to promise, as soon as he has done using\r\nthem. Another copy, made by Burton himself in 1628, was given to Dr. W.\r\nStukeley by Thomas Allen, Esq., lord of Finchley, in June, 1758, and\r\nfinally came to the Library with Gough's collection. It is now numbered\r\nGough, General Topog. 2. It is injured by damp at the beginning, but has\r\nbeen repaired by Stukeley. The third copy is a later transcript, also in\r\nGough's collection, and numbered General Topog. 1.\r\n\r\n[91] An eighth volume of the _Itinerary_ was given by Charles King, M.A.\r\nof Ch. Ch. some time subsequently, having been lent by Burton and not\r\nrecovered at the time of his own gift.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1633.\r\n\r\nA singular motto stamped upon the binding of two books, and it may be of\r\nmore, within a border of cornucopiæ, &c., attracts the attention of the\r\nreader. The books are, vols. i. ii. of Du Chesne's _Historiæ Francorum\r\nScriptores_, 1636 (A. 2. 9. 10. Jur.), and Halloix's _Ecclesiæ\r\nOrientalis Scriptores_, 1633 (G. 2. 3. Th.); the motto is, 'Coronasti\r\nannum bonitatis Tuæ, Ps. 65. Annuo reditu quinque librarum Margaretæ\r\nBrooke.' An explanation is found in an entry in the Benefaction-Register\r\nunder the year 1632 or 1633, where we read as follows: 'D. Margareta\r\nBrooke, vidua, quondam uxor Ducis Brooke, de Temple-Combe in comitatu\r\nSomerset, armigeri defuncti, donavit centum libras, quibus perquisitus\r\nest annuus reditus quinque librarum ad coemendos libros in usum\r\nbibliothecæ in perpetuum.' Probably the books thus stamped were the\r\nfirst that were bought after the final settlement of the gift. The rent\r\narises from land at Wick-Risington, in Gloucestershire, and the sum duly\r\nappears to this day in the annual accounts of the Library. In 1655, the\r\nthen Librarian, Barlow, makes a memorandum in his accounts that the\r\nUniversity had not paid over this rent for several years; in consequence\r\nof his calling attention to this neglect, the arrears were paid up in\r\n1658. At the same time the rents of the houses in Distaff Lane were\r\nheavily in arrear.\r\n\r\nA (second) gift from Sir Henry Wotton consisted of the copy of Tycho\r\nBrahe's _Astronomiæ instaurandæ mechanica_, 1598, which the author gave\r\nto Grimani, Doge of Venice, containing several additional pages in MS.\r\nwith two autograph epigrams; and also of a MS. of the _Acta Concilii\r\nConstantiensis_, which had formerly belonged to Card. Bembi, now\r\nnumbered _e Musæo_, 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1634.\r\n\r\nIn this year Sir Kenelm Digby gave a collection of 238 MSS. (including\r\nfive rolls) all on vellum, uniformly bound, and stamped with his arms,\r\nwhich still form a distinct series. They are, for the most part, of the\r\nhighest interest and importance, especially with reference to the early\r\nhistory of science in England. Amongst them are works by Roger Bacon,\r\nGrosteste, Will. Reade, John Eschyndon or Ashton, Roger of Hereford,\r\nRichard Wallingford, Simon Bredon, Thomas of New-market, and many\r\nothers. They also comprise much relating to the general history of\r\nEngland, and are almost entirely the work of English scribes. Many of\r\nthem had previously belonged to Thomas Allen, of Gloucester Hall, who\r\nhimself was a liberal donor to the Library. [_See_ p. 19.] Two\r\nadditional MSS., which formerly belonged to Digby, and which each\r\ncontain his inscription, 'Hic est liber publicæ Bibliothecæ academiæ\r\nOxoniensis, K.D.,' were purchased in 1825. One of these, _R. Baconis\r\nopuscula_, was bought for £51; the other, a Latin translation, by W. de\r\nMorbeck, of Proclus' Commentary on Plato, for £31 10_s._ They are\r\nuniformly bound with the rest of the series, and are numbered 235 and\r\n236 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe donor stipulated that his MSS. should not be strictly confined to\r\nuse within the walls of the Library. Archbishop Laud says, in the letter\r\nin which, as Chancellor, he announced the gift to the University, 'hee\r\nwill not subiect these manuscripts to the strictnes of Sir Thomas\r\nBodley's statutes[92], but will haue libertie given for any man of\r\nwoorth, that wilbee at the paines and charge to print any of these\r\nbookes, to haue them oute of the Librarye vpon good caution giuen; but\r\nto that purpose and noe other[93].' But he afterwards left the\r\nUniversity at liberty to deal as it pleased with his MSS. in this\r\nparticular, as well as in all other questions that might arise\r\nconcerning his books. In a letter to Dr. Langbaine, dated Nov. 7, 1654,\r\nhe says: 'The absolute disposition of them in all occurrences dependeth\r\nwholly and singly of the University; for she knoweth best what will be\r\nmost for her service and advantage, and she is absolute mistress to\r\ndispose of them as she pleaseth[94].' He mentions in the same letter two\r\ntrunks of Arabic MSS. which he gave to Archbp. Laud to send to the\r\nUniversity or to St. John's College, but he never heard whether they\r\nreached their destination or no. He promises also to send over some more\r\nMSS. from France when he has returned thither; since, when the troubles\r\nof the Rebellion drove him into exile, he had carried his library with\r\nhim. Upon the Restoration, however, and his own return to England, he\r\nunfortunately left his books behind; and after his death they were\r\nconfiscated by the French King as belonging to an alien, and\r\nsubsequently sold. Doubtless the two MSS. acquired in 1825 were among\r\nthose to which his letter refers.\r\n\r\nThe first stone of the western end of the Library, with the Convocation\r\nHouse beneath, was laid on May 13, 1634; it was fitted up with shelves\r\nand ready for use by 1640. Selden's books were placed here in 1659. The\r\nhideous great west window is a monument of the bad taste of the time; it\r\nis much to be hoped that it may some day be replaced by a window more\r\nworthy of its conspicuous position, and affording a less marked contrast\r\nwith its opposite neighbour, the noble east window erected by Bodley\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n[92] See under 1654-9.\r\n\r\n[93] Reg. Conv. R. 24, 102. From MS. note by Dr. Bliss.\r\n\r\n[94] [Walker's] _Letters by Eminent Persons, from the Bodl. and Ashm._,\r\n1813, vol. i. pp. 2, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1635.\r\n\r\nIn this year Rouse issued an Appendix to the Catalogue published in\r\n1620, consisting of 208 pages in quarto, in double columns, and\r\ncontaining, as he says, about 1500 authors. James, on the title-page of\r\nhis Catalogue in 1620, speaks of an Appendix accompanying that issue;\r\nhence, probably, it is that the words 'Editio secunda' are placed on the\r\ntitle of the Appendix of 1635. But, strange to say, no copy of the\r\nearlier Appendix can now be found existing in the Library. At the end of\r\nthe later one is added [by John Verneuil, then Sub-Librarian,] an\r\nanonymous enlarged edition (which was also sold separately) of James'\r\n_Catalogus interpretum S. Script, in Bibl. Bodl._, with an Appendix of\r\nauthors who had written on the _Sentences_ and the _Summa_, on the\r\nSunday-Gospels, on Cases of Conscience, on the Lord's Prayer, the\r\nApostles' Creed, and the Decalogue. A book giving an account of all the\r\ncopies of the Catalogue sold between 1620-47, with the names of the\r\npurchasers, still exists, the latter part being in the handwriting of\r\nVerneuil; but some leaves have been torn out at the year 1635. It\r\nappears from this book that the price of James' Catalogue was 2_s._\r\n8_d._, that of the Catalogue of Interpreters 6_d._, of the Appendix\r\n2_s._, and of the whole series complete 5_s._\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1635-1640.\r\n\r\nThe Register for these years presents a connected series of benefactions\r\non the part of Archbishop Laud.\r\n\r\nOn May 22, 1635, he sent to the Library the first instalment of his\r\nmagnificent gifts of MSS. which consisted of 462 volumes and five rolls.\r\nAmong these were 46 Latin MSS., 'e Collegio Herbipolensi [Würtzburg] in\r\nGermania sumpti A.D. 1631, cum Suecorum Regis exercitus per universam\r\nfere Germaniam grassarentur.' Laud directs, in his letter of gift, that\r\nnone of the books shall on any account be taken out of the Library,\r\n'nisi solum ut typis mandentur, et sic publici et juris et utilitatis\r\nfiant,' upon sufficient security, to be approved by the Vice-Chancellor\r\nand Proctors; the MS., in such cases, being immediately after printing\r\nrestored to its place in the Library[95]. This permission was acted upon\r\nin the year 1647-8, when Patrick Young, the Librarian of the Royal\r\nLibrary at St. James's, was allowed to have the use of several\r\nvolumes[96].\r\n\r\nIn 1636, 181 MSS. formed the Archbishop's second gift, which were\r\naccompanied by five cabinets of coins in gold, silver, and brass, with a\r\nlist arranged chronologically; an Arabic astrolabe, of brass[97]; two\r\nidols, one Egyptian, the other from the West Indies; and the fine bust\r\nof King Charles I, 'singulari artificio ex purissimo ære conflatam,'\r\nwhich is now placed under the arch opening into the central portion of\r\nthe Library. This beautiful work of art is believed by Mr. John Bruce,\r\nthe learned Vice-President of the Society of Antiquaries, who is engaged\r\nin researches into the life and productions of Hubert Le Sœur, the\r\nartist of the statue at Charing Cross, to be, (as well as the bust given\r\nby Laud to St. John's College,) a specimen of the skill of that famous\r\ncraftsman. The existing arrangements of the Library being found\r\ninsufficient for such large accessions, the lower end was fitted up in\r\n1638-9 for the reception of Laud's books, for the cost of which £300 was\r\nvoted by Convocation[98]. In the following year, 555 more MSS. were\r\nreceived, together with a magical wand or staff, and some additional\r\ncoins. The wand is of dark polished wood, 2 feet 9 inches long, with a\r\ngrotesquely-carved figure at the head, apparently of Mexican\r\nworkmanship: it is now kept in one of the Sub-Librarians' studies. The\r\nlast gift from the munificent Chancellor of the University came in the\r\nnext year, 1640, and consisted of no more than 81 MSS.; for troubles\r\nwere beginning to gather now around the head of the Archbishop, and the\r\nLibrary at Oxford felt the blows which were levelled at Lambeth. This\r\nwas accompanied with the following touching letter:--\r\n\r\n    'Viris mihi amicissimis Doctori Potter, Vice-Cancellario,\r\n    reliquisque Doctoribus, Procuratoribus, necnon singulis in domo\r\n    Convocationis intra almam Universitatem Oxon. congregatis.\r\n\r\n    'Non datur scribendi otium.

CANT.[99]\r\n    'Dat. ex ædibus meis\r\n  'Lambethanis, 6^to Nov. 1640.'\r\n\r\nThe collection, which contains in the whole nearly 1300 MSS., comprises\r\nworks in very many languages: Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic, Persian,\r\nTurkish, Armenian, Ethiopic, Chinese, Russian, Greek, Latin, French,\r\nGerman, Italian, Irish, Anglo-Saxon, and English are all represented. It\r\nis impossible, in the limits of this survey, to point out many of the\r\ntreasures with which the collection abounds; but that which is\r\npre-eminently styled 'Codex Laudianus' (numbered Laud, Gr. 35) must not,\r\nof course, be omitted. It is a MS. of the Acts of the Apostles, in\r\nquarto, consisting of 227 leaves, and containing the text in both Greek\r\nand Latin, in parallel columns. Its date has been variously fixed by\r\ncritics, from the sixth to the eighth century; Mr. Coxe places it\r\ntowards the end of the seventh century, with whom Dr. Tischendorf, who\r\nexamined it in 1865, and for whom some photographs of portions were\r\nexecuted, is believed to coincide. Some leaves are wanting at the end,\r\ncommencing at chap. xxvi. 29. It is the only MS. known to be extant\r\nwhich contains the peculiar readings (in number 74) cited by Bede in his\r\nCommentary as existing in the copy which he used; it has consequently\r\nbeen conjectured, with much reason, that this was the very MS. which he\r\npossessed. It was published by Thomas Hearne in 1715, printed in\r\ncapitals corresponding line for line with the MS., but not with entire\r\ncorrectness; only 120 copies were printed, and it is therefore one of\r\nthe rarest in the series of his works. A very fairly engraved facsimile\r\nof one verse (vii. 2) is to be found in Horne's _Introduction_.\r\n\r\nAnother famous MS. (No. 636) is a copy of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,\r\nwhich ends at the year 1154, and appears to have been written in, and to\r\nhave belonged to, the abbey of Peterborough, from its containing many\r\nadditions relating thereto. And a third treasure calling for special\r\nmention is an Irish vellum MS. (No. 610), which contains the Psalter of\r\nCashel, Cormac's Glossary, Poems attributed to SS. Columb-kill and\r\nPatrick, &c.[100] The Greek MSS. of the collection are fully described\r\nin vol. i. of the _Catal. Codd. Bibl. Bodl._, by Mr. H. O. Coxe,\r\npublished in 1853; the Latin, Biblical, and Classical, with the\r\nMiscellaneous, in Part I of the second volume, published by the same\r\ngentleman in 1858; the Oriental, in the various Catalogues of Uri,\r\nNicoll, Pusey, Dillmann, and Payne Smith.\r\n\r\nOne of the Würtzburg books rescued from the Swedish soldiery is a\r\nmagnificent Missal printed on vellum by Jeorius Ryser in 1481, with\r\nilluminated initials. On a fly-leaf is the following note: '1481,\r\nJohannes Kewsch, vicarius in ecclesia Herb[ipolensi] hunc librum\r\ncomparavit propriis expensis, et pro omnibus, scil. pergameno,\r\nimpressura, rubricatione, illinatura, et ligatione, xviii. flor.' Then\r\nfollows a bequest, in his own hand, in 1486, of the book to the\r\nsuccessive vicars of St. Bartholomew, which is repeated at the end of\r\nthe 'Canon Missæ.' In the latter place four subsequent possessors, from\r\n1565 to 1580, have written their names, the last of them adding, 'Omnis\r\narbor qui non facit fructum bonum excidetur et in ignem mittetur.'

Carew, afterwards Earl of Totness, are also to be found here.\r\nA list of their contents, as of those of the other volumes preserved at\r\nLambeth and in University College, is printed in Mr. T. Duffus Hardy's\r\n_Report to the Master of the Rolls on the Carte and Carew Papers_, 8^o,\r\nLond. 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1637.\r\n\r\nA Bachelor of Arts and Fellow of St. John's College, one Abraham Wright,\r\npublished the results of his lighter reading in the Bodleian in a little\r\nvolume printed by Leonard Lichfield, which he entitled, _Delitiæ\r\nDelitiarum, sive Epigrammatum ex optimis quibusque hujus et novissimi\r\nseculi Poetis in amplissima illa Bibliotheca Bodleiana, et pene omnino\r\nalibi extantibus, ανθολογια_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1640.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 25, 1639-40, died Robert Burton, of Ch. Ch., 'Democritus\r\njunior,' and bequeathed out of his large library whatever he possessed\r\nwhich was wanting in the Bodleian. A list of the Latin books thus\r\nacquired is given in the Benefaction Book, followed by this sentence:\r\n'Porro [d. d.] comœdiarum, tragediarum, et schediasmatum ludicrorum\r\n(præsertim idiomate vernaculo) aliquot centurias, quas propter\r\nmultitudinem non adjecimus.' These latter were just the classes of books\r\nthe admission of which the Founder had almost prohibited, viz.,\r\n'almanacks, plays, and an infinite number that are daily printed.' Even\r\nif 'some little profit might be reaped (which God knows is very little)\r\nout of some of our play-books, the benefit thereof,' said he, 'will\r\nnothing near countervail the harm that the scandal will bring upon the\r\nLibrary, when it shall be given out that we stuffed it full of baggage\r\nbooks[101].' In consequence of this well-meant but mistaken resolution,\r\nthe Library was bare of just those books which Burton's collection could\r\nafford, and which now form some of its rarest and most curious\r\ndivisions. In his own address 'To the Reader' of his _Anatomy of\r\nMelancholy_ he very fully describes the nature of his own gatherings. 'I\r\nhear new news every day; and those ordinary rumours of war, plagues,\r\nfires, inundations, thefts, murders, massacres, meteors, comets,\r\nspectrums, prodigies, apparitions, of towns taken, cities besieged in\r\nFrance, Germany, Turkey, Persia, Poland, &c. * * * * are daily brought\r\nto our ears; new books every day, pamphlets, currantoes, stories (&c).\r\nNow come tidings of weddings, maskings, mummeries, entertainments,\r\njubilees, embassies, tilts and tournaments, trophies, triumphs, revels,\r\nsports, plays; then again, as in a new shifted scene, treasons, cheating\r\ntricks, robberies, enormous villainies, in all kinds, funerals, burials,\r\ndeath of princes, new discoveries, expeditions; now comical, then\r\ntragical matters.' His books are chiefly to be found in the classes\r\nmarked 4^o Art. (particularly under letter L), Theol., and Art. BS.\r\nAmongst his smaller books is one of the only two known copies of the\r\nedition of _Venus and Adonis_ in 1602. He is specially mentioned also in\r\nthe preface to Verneuil's _Nomenclator_, 1642, as being (together with\r\nMr. Kilby of Linc. Coll., Mr. Prestwich, of All Souls', and Mr. Francis\r\nWright, of Merton) a donor of Commentaries and Sermons. Besides his\r\nbooks, he bequeathed £100, with which an annual payment of £5 was\r\nobtained. For some time, however, this payment was subsequently lost;\r\nfor in Barlow's Accounts for 1655, after mentioning the receipt of £40\r\npaid by one Mr. Thomas Smith, occurs this '_Memorandum_:--that the £40\r\nabove mentioned amongst the _Recepta_ is a part of an £100 given to the\r\nLibrary by Mr. Rob. Burton of Ch. Ch. It was first lent to Mr. Thomas\r\nSmith, and he (by bond) was to pay to the Library £5 per annum. He\r\nbreaking, or very much decay'd in his estate, and deade, this £40 was\r\npayd in by his executors, £50 more is to be payd us by University Coll.\r\n(it was owinge to Mr. Smith, and his executors assigned it over to us),\r\nand Dr. Langbaine hath in his keepinge a bond of one Spencer for £10\r\nmore.' The latter was paid in 1658, as appears from an entry, 'Recept. a\r\nDno. Spicer (_sic_) et Hopkins, ex syngrapha;' but the former was still\r\nunpaid in 1660.\r\n\r\n[101] _Reliquiæ Bodl._ p. 278.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1641.\r\n\r\nThe famous 'Guy Fawkes' Lantern,' which is to this day such an object of\r\ninterest in the Picture Gallery to most sight-seers, was presented to\r\nthe University by Robert Heywood, M.A., Brasenose College, who had been\r\nProctor in 1639. It came into his possession from his being the son of a\r\nJustice of the Peace who assisted in searching the cellars of the\r\nParliament House, and arrested Fawkes with the lantern in his hand. In\r\n1640 this Justice Heywood was wounded by a Roman Catholic when, while\r\nstill holding office as a Justice for Westminster, he was engaged in\r\nproposing the oaths to the recusants of that city[102]. The following\r\ninscription is attached to it, engraved upon a brass plate: 'Lāterna\r\nilla ipsa, qua usus est et cum qua deprehensus Guido Faux in crypta\r\nsubterranea, ubi domo Parlamenti difflandæ operam dabat. Ex dono Rob.\r\nHeywood, nuper Academiæ Procuratoris, Apr. 4, 1641.' From being for many\r\nyears exposed to the handling of every visitor, it became much broken;\r\nbut it has now for a long time been secured from further injury by being\r\nenclosed in a glass case.\r\n\r\nIn May an order was made by the Curators that no strangers should have\r\nthe use of any MSS. without finding sureties for the safety of the same,\r\nin consequence of a suspicion that whole pages had been in some cases\r\nabstracted. Hereupon a very earnest, and, in sooth, indignant,\r\nremonstrance was presented to the 'Curatores vigilantissimi' by the\r\nstrangers then residing in Oxford 'studiorum causa.' The original\r\ndocument is preserved in Wood MS. F. 27, and is signed by eleven persons\r\nfrom Prussia and other parts of Germany, six Danes, and one Englishman\r\n(John Wyberd), a medical student. Some of these visitors are found, by\r\nreference to the Register of Readers, to have been students for a\r\nconsiderable time; the Baron ab Eulenberg, for instance, having been\r\nadmitted on Jan. 18, 1638-9, and one Ven, a Dane, in 1633. The\r\nmemorialists say that there is not even the very slightest ground for\r\nattributing such an offence to any of them, and that the Librarian\r\nhimself candidly confesses that it has never been proved to him that\r\nstrangers have ever done anything of the kind; they urge the difficulty\r\nof their finding sponsors for their honesty when they themselves are\r\nstrangers and foreigners; they appeal to Bodley's own statutes as\r\nproviding sufficiently for the contingency by ordering the Librarian to\r\nnumber the pages of a MS. before giving it out, and to examine it when\r\nreturned; they fortify their arguments by abundant references to the\r\ncivil law; they upbraid those who,--'internecino exterorum atque\r\nadvenarum odio æstuantes (O celebratam Britanniæ\r\nhospitalitatem!),'--have originated the calumny; and, finally, warn the\r\nCurators against giving occasion for suspicion to the learned men of the\r\nwhole world that 'doctos Angliæ viros, priscæ hospitalitatis immemores,\r\nmajori exterorum quam Athenienses Megarensium odio flagrare.' The\r\nmemorial is endorsed: 'De hac re amplius deliberandum censebant Præfecti\r\nult. Maii, 1641;' and no doubt the obnoxious order was soon repealed.\r\nHalf a century later, on Nov. 8, 1693, the order was in a certain degree\r\nrenewed: it was then enjoined 'that no one be permitted to _transcribe_\r\nany manuscript, but such as have a right to study in the Library.' The\r\nrevival, however, was not due to any revived fear of foreigners; the\r\nfollowing reason is given in a letter of information on Library matters\r\nfrom Dr. Hyde to Hudson, his successor, written on the latter's\r\nappointment in 1701:--'Some in the University have been very troublesome\r\nin pressing that their Servitors may transcribe manuscripts for them,\r\nthough not sworn to the Library, nor yet capable of being sworn;\r\nwherefore the Curators made an order (as you will find in the Book of\r\nOrders in the Archives) \"that none were capable of transcribing, except\r\nthose who had the right of studying in the Library,\" viz.\r\nBatchelors[103].' But no doubt this order also soon became dormant, even\r\nif it were not definitely repealed.\r\n\r\n[102] Neal's _History of the Puritans_, i. 688.\r\n\r\n[103] Walker's _Letters of Eminent Men_, 1813, vol. i. p. 175.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1642.\r\n\r\n'The Kinge, Jul. 11, 1642, had £500 out of Sir Th.

Dunst._ p. 757.)\r\n\r\nIt must have been about the close of this year or beginning of the next,\r\nwhile the king was in winter quarters at Oxford, that the visit was paid\r\nto the Library, which is the subject of the following well-known\r\nanecdote. It is here quoted from the earliest authority in which it is\r\nfound, viz. Welwood's _Memoirs_, Lond. 1700. pp. 105-107:--\r\n\r\n'The King being at Oxford during the Civil Wars, went one day to see the\r\nPublick Library, where he was show'd among other Books, a Virgil nobly\r\nprinted and exquisitely bound. The Lord Falkland, to divert the King,\r\nwould have his Majesty make a trial of his fortune by the _Sortes\r\nVirgilianæ_, which everybody knows was an usual kind of augury some ages\r\npast. Whereupon the King opening the book, the period which happen'd to\r\ncome up was that part of Dido's imprecation against Æneas, which Mr.\r\nDryden translates thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"Yet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes,\r\n    His peaceful entrance with dire arts oppose,\r\n    Oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field,\r\n    His men discourag'd, and himself expell'd,\r\n    Let him for succour sue from place to place,\r\n    Torn from his subjects, and his son's embrace.\r\n    First let him see his friends in battel slain,\r\n    And their untimely fate lament in vain:\r\n    And when at length the cruel war shall cease,\r\n    On hard conditions may he buy his peace.\r\n    Nor let him then enjoy supreme command,\r\n    But fall untimely by some hostile hand,\r\n    And lye unburi'd in the common sand.\"\r\n\r\n  (Æneid, iv. 88.)\r\n\r\nIt is said K. Charles seem'd concerned at this accident, and that the\r\nLord Falkland observing it, would likewise try his own fortune in the\r\nsame manner; hoping he might fall upon some passage that could have no\r\nrelation to his case, and thereby divert the King's thoughts from any\r\nimpression the other might have upon him. But the place that Falkland\r\nstumbled upon was yet more suited to his destiny than the other had been\r\nto the King's, being the following expressions of Evander upon the\r\nuntimely death of his son Pallas, as they are translated by the same\r\nhand:--\r\n\r\n    \"O Pallas, thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,\r\n    To fight with reason, not to tempt the sword.\r\n    I warned thee, but in vain, for well I knew\r\n    What perils youthful ardor would pursue;\r\n    That boiling blood would carry thee too far,\r\n    Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war.\r\n    Oh! curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,\r\n    Prelude of bloody fields and fights to come.\"\r\n\r\n  (Æneid, xi. 220.)'\r\n\r\nThere is no copy of Virgil now in the Library amongst those which it\r\npossessed previously to 1642, which is 'exquisitely bound' as well as\r\n'nobly printed;' it is not therefore possible to fix on the particular\r\nvolume which the King consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1645.\r\n\r\nA small slip of paper, carefully preserved, is the memorial of an\r\ninteresting incident connected with the last days in Oxford of the\r\nMartyr-King whose history is so indissolubly united with that of the\r\nplace. Amidst all the darkening anxieties which filled the three or four\r\nmonths preceding the surrender of himself to the Scots, King Charles\r\nappears to have snatched some leisure moments for refreshment in quiet\r\nreading. His own library was no longer his; but there was one close at\r\nhand which could more than supply it. So, to the Librarian Rous, (the\r\nfriend of Milton, but whose anti-monarchical tendencies, we may be sure,\r\nhad always hitherto been carefully concealed) there came, on Dec. 30,\r\nan order, 'To the Keeper of the University Library, or to his deputy,'\r\ncouched in the following terms: 'Deliver unto the bearer hereof, for the\r\npresent use of his Majesty, a book intituled, _Histoire universelle du\r\nSieur D'Aubigné_, and this shall be your warrant;' and the order was one\r\nwhich the Vice-Chancellor had subscribed with his special authorization,\r\n'His Majestyes use is in commaund to us. S. Fell, Vice Can.' But the\r\nLibrarian had sworn to observe the Statutes which, with no respect of\r\npersons, forbad such a removal of a book; and so, on the reception of\r\nFell's order, Rous 'goes to the King; and shews him the Statutes, which\r\nbeing read, the King would not have the booke, nor permit it to be taken\r\nout of the Library, saying it was fit that the will and statutes of the\r\npious founder should be religiously observed[104].'\r\n\r\nPerhaps a little of the hitherto undeveloped Puritan spirit may have\r\nhelped to enliven the conscience of the Librarian, who, had he been a\r\nCavalier, might have possibly found something in the exceptional\r\ncircumstances of the case, to excuse a violation of the rule; but, as\r\nthe matter stood, it reflects, on the one hand, the highest credit both\r\non Rous's honesty and courage, and shows him to have been fit for the\r\nplace he held, while, on the other hand, the King's acquiescence in the\r\nrefusal does equal credit to his good-sense and good-temper. We shall\r\nsee that this occurrence formed a precedent for a like refusal to the\r\nProtector in 1654 by Rous's successor, when Cromwell showed equal good\r\nfeeling and equal respect for law.\r\n\r\n[104] Bp. Barlow's Argument against Lending Books. _MS._\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1646.\r\n\r\n'When Oxford was surrendered (24^o Junii, 1646) the first thing Generall\r\nFairfax did was to set a good guard of soldiers to preserve the\r\nBodleian Library. 'Tis said there was more hurt donne by the Cavaliers\r\n(during their garrison) by way of embezzilling and cutting off chaines\r\nof bookes then there was since. He was a lover of learning, and had he\r\nnot taken this special care, that noble library had been utterly\r\ndestroyed, for there were ignorant senators enough who would have been\r\ncontented to have had it so. This I doe assure you from an ocular\r\nwitnesse, E. W. esq[105].'\r\n\r\n[105] Aubrey's _Lives_; in _Letters by Eminent Persons_, ii. 346.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1647.\r\n\r\nJohn Verneuil, M.A., Sub-librarian, died about the end of September. He\r\nwas a native of Bordeaux, and came into England as a Protestant refugee\r\nshortly before 1608. In that year he entered at Magdalene College, and\r\nwas incorporated M.A. from his own University of Montauban in 1625.\r\nBesides his share in the Appendix to the Catalogue noticed under the\r\nyear 1635, the following small book of a similar kind in English was\r\nissued by him: _A Nomenclator of such Tracts and Sermons as have beene\r\nprinted, or translated into English upon any place or booke of Holy\r\nScripture; now to be had in the most famous and publique Library of Sir\r\nThomas Bodley in Oxford_. This is the title of the second and enlarged\r\nedition, which appeared in 1642 in a small duodecimo volume, printed at\r\nOxford, by Henry Hall. The first edition (which was not entirely\r\nconfined to books in the Library) was printed under the author's\r\ninitials by William Turner in 1637. Some books communicated by friends\r\nare here cited, which would, says Verneuil, have been accessible in the\r\nBodleian, 'had the Company of Stationers beene as mindfull of their\r\ncovenant as my selfe have beene zealous for the good of this our\r\nLibrary.' In an interesting undated letter from Sir Richard Napier, Knt.\r\n(while apparently an undergraduate of Wadham College, before 1630) to\r\nhis uncle the Rev. Richard Napier, which is preserved in Ashmole MS.\r\n1730, fol. 168, is the following curious passage relating to the\r\nfacilities for studying in the Library, which were afforded to him by\r\nVerneuil:--\r\n\r\n'I have made a faire way to goe into the Library privately when I\r\nplease, and there to sitt from 6 of the clocke in the morneing to 5 at\r\nnight. I have a private place in the Library to lay those bookes and to\r\nwrite out what I list, without being seene by any, or any comeing to me.\r\nI have made the second Keeper of the Library [_i.e._ Verneuil] my friend\r\nand servant, who promised me his key at all tymes to goe in privately,\r\nwhen as otherwise it is not opened above 4 houres a day, and some days\r\nnot att all, as on Hollidays, and their eves in the afternoone, yett\r\nthen by his meanes I shall [have] free accesse and recesse at all tymes.\r\nHe hath pleasured me so farr as to lett me write in his counting house,\r\nor his little private study in the great publick library, where I may\r\nvery privately write, and locke up all safely when I depart thence; he\r\nwill write for me when I have not the leisure, or will transcribe any\r\nthinge I shall desire him, and if it be French translate it, for that is\r\nhis mother tonge.'\r\n\r\nProbably the practice here mentioned of admitting readers by favour into\r\nthe Library at unstatutable times grew in the course of years to a\r\nconsiderable height, or was found (as might naturally be expected)\r\nproductive of mischievous consequences, for on Nov. 8, 1722, it was\r\n'ordered by the Curators that no person under any pretence whatsoever be\r\npermitted to study in the said Library at any other time than what is\r\nprescribed and limited by the Bodleian Statutes.'\r\n\r\nVerneuil was succeeded in his office in the Library by Francis Yonge,\r\nM.A., of Oriel College.\r\n\r\nMilton's gift of his _Poems_. See under 1620.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1648.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Readers' Register for 1647-8, 1648-9, is a list of\r\nnine volumes 'olim surrepti,' of which five had been replaced by other\r\ncopies. Entries are made in the same place of some coins which were\r\ngiven in 1648-50. At this period the Library appears to have been well\r\nattended by readers; about twelve or fifteen quarto and octavo volumes\r\nbeing daily entered, those of folio size being accessible (as, in regard\r\nto a portion of the Library, is still the case) by the readers\r\nthemselves, and not registered because at that time chained to their\r\nshelves. The register for the next years (as well as those which\r\nfollowed, up to the year 1708) appears to be lost, so that it cannot be\r\nascertained whether this daily average continued during the Usurpation;\r\nbut thus far it seems that Dr. John Allibond's description of the state\r\nof the Library as consequent on the Puritan visitation of the University\r\nin 1648, is not borne out by facts. For that loyal humourist, in his\r\n_Rustica Academiæ Oxoniensis nuper reformatæ Descriptio_, which is\r\nsupposed to commemorate the condition of Oxford in Oct. 1648, writes\r\nthus of our Library:--\r\n\r\n    'Conscendo orbis illud decus\r\n      Bodleio fundatore:\r\n    Sed intus erat nullum pecus,\r\n      Excepto janitore.\r\n\r\n    Neglectos vidi libros multos,\r\n      Quod mimime mirandum:\r\n    Nam inter bardos tot et stultos\r\n      There's few could understand 'em.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1649.\r\n\r\n'The Jews proffer £600,000 for Paul's, and Oxford Library, and may have\r\nthem for £200,000 more[106].' They wished to obtain the first for a\r\nsynagogue, and to do a little commercial business with the second. It is\r\nsaid in Monteith's _History of the Troubles_ (translated by Ogilvie,\r\n1735, p. 473) that the sum they offered was £500,000, but that the\r\nCouncil of War refused to take less than £800,000: probably they\r\nafterwards increased this their original bid to £600,000.\r\n\r\nPhilip, Earl of Pembroke, the Puritan Chancellor of the University, gave\r\na splendidly bound copy of the Paris Polyglott, printed in 1645 in 10\r\nvols.\r\n\r\n[106] London News-letter of April 2; printed in Carte's _Collection of\r\nLetters_, vol. i. p. 275.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1652.\r\n\r\nJohn Rous, the Librarian, died in the beginning of April, probably on\r\nApril 3, as, the Statutes requiring the election of Librarian to take\r\nplace within three days of a vacancy, it was on the 6th of that month\r\nthat Thomas Barlow, M.A., Fellow of Queen's College, was unanimously\r\nelected to be Rous's successor. At the same time certain orders were\r\nread in Convocation which the Curators had made, for the formation by\r\nthe Librarian of a Catalogue of the coins and other rarities, providing\r\nalso that they should be regularly visited and verified by the Curators\r\nevery November[107].\r\n\r\nA legacy of £20 from Rous to the Library is entered in the Benefaction\r\nRegister, under the year 1661, probably because it may not have been\r\nactually received until that year.\r\n\r\n[107] Reg.

See under 1629.\r\n\r\n[108] Barlow's Argument against Lending Books out.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1654-1659.\r\n\r\nThe death of John Selden occurred on Nov. 30[109]. By his will the\r\nLibrary became possessed at once of his collection of Oriental and Greek\r\nMSS., together with a few Latin MSS. specially designated, as well as of\r\nsuch of his Talmudical and Rabbinical books as were not already to be\r\nfound there. It has generally been supposed that no part of his library\r\nwas received before the year 1659, and that none at all was actually\r\nbequeathed by Selden. The account usually given (taken from Burnet's\r\nLife of Sir M. Hales, p. 156[110]) is that Selden was so offended with\r\nthe University for refusing the loan of a MS., except upon a bond for\r\n£1000, that he revoked that part of his will which left his library to\r\nthe Bodleian, and put it entirely at the free disposal of his executors,\r\nand that they, when five years had passed, during which the Society of\r\nthe Inner Temple (to whom it was first offered) had taken no steps to\r\nprovide a building for its reception, conceiving themselves to be\r\nexecutors not of Selden's passion but of his will, sent it in 1659 to\r\nits original destination[111]. But it is clear from Selden's will (as\r\nprinted by Wilkins in his _Works_, vol. i. p. lv.) that the books\r\nmentioned above were really bequeathed by him to Oxford; a line or two\r\nappears to be somehow omitted, by which the sense of the passage is\r\nlost, and in consequence of which the name of the Library does not\r\nappear, but there is a general reference to it both in the specification\r\nof such Hebrew books as are 'not already in the Library,' and in the\r\nmention of the '_said_ Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars' of the\r\nUniversity (although no previous mention of them occurs); while all\r\nother books not thus conveyed are left to the disposal of his executors.\r\nBut a letter from Langbaine to Pococke, written from London only three\r\ndays after Selden's death, furnishes proof positive; for there the\r\nformer writes, as executor, that all the Oriental MSS., with such\r\nRabbinical and Talmudical printed books as were not already in the\r\nLibrary, and the Greek MSS. not otherwise disposed of, are left to\r\nOxford[112]. And in the Annual Accounts, under the year 1655, we find\r\nthe following entries:--\r\n\r\n  Pro vectura codicum MSS. a Londino Oxoniam                £0 9_s._\r\n  D. Langbaine pro expensis cum Londinum petiit, libros a\r\n    Seldeno legatos repetiturus                              5 0\r\n  D. Ed. Pococke eodem tempore in rem eandem Londinum misso. 7 0\r\n\r\nIt is clear, therefore, that a portion of Selden's collection came to\r\nthe Library by his bequest immediately after his death. And the reason\r\nwhy the whole was not bequeathed is certainly not correctly stated by\r\nBurnet, nor even by Wood, who says that he had been informed that it was\r\nbecause the borrowing of certain MSS. had been refused. For the\r\nConvocation Register shows that a grace was _passed_ in Convocation, on\r\nAug. 29, 1654, which sanctioned the giving leave to Selden to have MSS.\r\nfrom the collections of Barocci, Roe, and Digby (these donors having\r\neither expressed an opinion, or distinctly stipulated, that the rigour\r\nof the Library Statutes should sometimes be relaxed), provided he did\r\nnot have more than three at a time, and that he gave bond in £100 (not\r\n£1000) for the return of each of them within a year[113]. Had these\r\nconditions been really the cause of Selden's taking offence, his\r\nexecutors would hardly have stipulated, as they actually did, in their\r\nown conditions of gift, that no book from his collection should\r\nhereafter be lent to any person upon any condition whatsoever. But there\r\nis certainly some obscurity hanging over the matter, which probably may\r\nbe dispersed by further investigation. The writer of the sketch of the\r\nhistory of the Bodleian prefixed to Bernard's _Cat. MSS._, after quoting\r\nWood's account, only says, when barely more than forty years had\r\nelapsed, that he will not venture to speak rashly about the case of the\r\nlending of books; as if it were already forgotten how the facts stood.\r\nOn the proposal to lend being first mooted, Barlow, the Librarian, drew\r\nup a paper on the general question, in which he opposed it both on the\r\ngrounds of Statute and expediency; the original MS. of which still\r\nexists in the Library. Selden was at first mentioned in this paper by\r\nname, with distinct reference to his application; but the name was\r\nsubsequently crossed out wherever it thus occurred, and the subject\r\ntreated without any personal reference[114]. In this paper the\r\nLibrarian objects to the proposal, firstly, on the ground of precedent,\r\nsince, though the University had power, with the joint consent of the\r\nChancellor, Heads of Houses, and Convocation, to lend books, yet it had\r\nnever thought fit to do so, except with regard to Lord Pembroke's MSS.;\r\nsecondly, on the ground that if the rule were once broken, it would be\r\nimpossible to refuse any person, without incurring great odium, while\r\nthe gratifying all applicants would disperse into private hands the\r\nbooks intended for the public. He then proceeds as follows:--\r\n\r\n'3. Suppose 3 bookes at a time be sent to any private man, 'tis true he\r\nis furnish'd, but 'tis manifestly to the prejudice of the Publick, the\r\nUniversity wanting those books while he has them; so that if any\r\nforreigner coming hither from abroad desire to see them, or any at home\r\ndesire to use them, both are disappointed, to the diminution of the\r\nhonour of the University, in the one, and the benefit it might have by\r\nthose books, in the other. And therefore it seems more agreeable to\r\nreason and the public good (and the declared will and precept of our\r\nprudent and pious Founder[115]) not to lend any books out of the\r\nLibrary; for by not lending, private persons only want the use of those\r\nbooks which are another's, whereas by lending, the University wants the\r\nuse of those books which are her own. Sure no prudent man can think it\r\nfit to gratify particular persons with the publick detriment.\r\n\r\n'4. The Library is a magazine which the pious Founder hath fix'd in a\r\npublick place for a publick use; and though his charity to private\r\npersons is such that he will hinder none (who is justly qualify'd and\r\nworthy) to come to it, yet his charity to the publick is such that he\r\nwould not have it ambulatory, to goe to any private person. And sure\r\n'tis more rational that Mahomet should go to the mountaine, than that\r\nthe mountaine should come to Mahomet.\r\n\r\n'5. Lending of books makes them lyable to many casualties, as, I.\r\nabsolute losse, either 1. _in via_, by the carrier's negligence, or\r\nviolence offer'd him, or, 2. _in termino_, they may be lost by the\r\nperson that borrows them; for (presuming the person noble, and carefull\r\nfor their preservation, yet) his house may be burn'd, or (by robbers)\r\nbroken open (as Mr. Selden's unhappily was not long since): or, (in case\r\nthey scape these casualties) they may be spoyl'd in the carriage, as by\r\nsad experience we find, for above 60 or 100 leaves of a Greek MS.[116]\r\nlent out of _Archiva Pembrochiana_ to Mr. Pat. Younge were irrecoverably\r\ndefaced. Now what has happen'd heretofore may happen hereafter; and\r\ntherefore to keep them sacredly (and without any lending) in the Library\r\n(according to our good Founder's will and statute) will be the best way\r\nfor their preservation.'\r\n\r\nBarlow adds finally, in the sixth and seventh places, that if all\r\nlending were declared unlawful, it would greatly encourage others to\r\ngive more to the Library when they saw how religiously their gifts would\r\nbe preserved, and that if no exceptions were made (except, as allowed\r\nby Archbp. Laud, for the purpose of printing), no applications would be\r\nmade, and no one would take it ill if he were denied.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for Selden's withholding his library in its entirety has,\r\nhowever, been assigned, besides those mentioned above, and this, too, by\r\nclosely contemporary writers. In July, 1649, the new intruded officers\r\nand fellows of Magdalene College found in the Muniment-room in the\r\ncloister-tower of the College, a large sum of money in the old coinage\r\ncalled _Spur-royals_[117], or _Ryals_, amounting to £1400, the\r\nequivalent of which had been left by the Founder as a reserve fund for\r\nlaw expenses, for re-erecting or repairing buildings destroyed by fire,\r\n&c., or for other extraordinary charges. This gold had been laid up and\r\ncounted in Q. Elizabeth's time and had remained untouched since then;\r\nconsequently, although some of the old members of the College were aware\r\nof its existence, to the new-comers it seemed a welcome and unexpected\r\ndiscovery, especially as the College was at the time heavily in debt.\r\nThey immediately proceeded to divide it among all the members on the\r\nFoundation proportionately, not excluding the choristers, (who were at\r\nthat time undergraduates), the Puritan President, Wilkinson, being alone\r\nopposed to such an illegal proceeding, and being with difficulty\r\nprevailed upon to accept £100 as his share, which, however, upon his\r\ndeath-bed he charged his executors to repay. The spur-royals were\r\nexchanged at the rate of 18_s._ 6_d._ to 20_s._each, and each fellow had\r\n33 of them. But when the fact of this embezzlement of corporate funds\r\nbecame known, the College was called to account by Parliament, and,\r\nalthough they attempted to defend themselves, they individually deemed\r\nit wise to refund the greater, or a considerable, part of what had been\r\nabstracted.[118] Fuller, whose _Church History_ was published in the\r\nyear following Selden's death, after telling this scandalous story,\r\nproceeds thus (book ix. p. 234):--'Sure I am, a great antiquarie lately\r\ndeceased (rich as well in his state as learning) at the hearing hereof\r\nquitted all his intention of benefaction to Oxford or any place else, on\r\nsuspition it would be diverted to other uses, on the same token that he\r\nmerrily said, I think the best way for a man to perpetuate his memory is\r\nto procure the Pope to canonize him for a saint, for then he shall be\r\nsure to be remembred in their Calender; whereas otherwise I see all\r\nProtestant charity subject to the covetousness of posterity to devour\r\nit, and bury the donor thereof in oblivion.' And the name of this 'great\r\nantiquarie' was supplied in 1659 by the Puritan writer Henry Hickman,\r\nwho, as a Demy of Magdalene College, had shared in the spoils. He, in\r\nthe Appendix to his _Justification of the Fathers and Schoolmen_, gives\r\n(in answer to a passage in Heylin's _Examen Historicum_) a full account\r\nof the dividing of the gold, adding, 'which, as is said, did hinder Mr.\r\nJohn Selden from bestowing his library on the University.' And Wood\r\n(_Hist. and Antiq._ by Gutch, ii. 942) says that he had been told that\r\nthis misappropriation was one reason of Selden's distaste at Oxford.\r\nFrom all this it is clear that Burnet's narrative gives a very\r\ninaccurate account of the matter.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1659 that the great mass of Selden's collection was\r\nforwarded by his executors. In the accounts for 1660 appear payments to\r\nBarlow of £20 'for his paines in procuring Mr. Selden's books,' and of\r\n£51 for his expenses thereon. The bringing the books from London cost\r\nabout £34, and the providing chains for them £25 10_s._[119]\r\nUnfortunately, during the interval, many books had been lost which had\r\nbeen borrowed in London, and were never returned. (Life, in _Works_, I.\r\nlii.) And a part, which somehow was not sent to Oxford, afterwards\r\naltogether perished, 'for the fire of the Temple destroyed in one of\r\ntheir chambers eight chests full of the registers of abbeys, and other\r\nmanuscripts relating to the history of England; tho' most of his\r\nlaw-books are still safe in Lincoln's Inn[120].' Some medical books were\r\nbequeathed to the College of Physicians. Some of the original deeds\r\nrelating to the gift were bought for the Library in 1837 for £1 1_s._\r\n\r\nAbout 8000 volumes were, in all, added to the Library by this gift, most\r\nof which bear Selden's well-known motto: 'περι παντος την ελευθεριαν.'\r\nAmongst them are some which belonged to Ben Jonson, Dr. Donne, and Sir\r\nRobert Cotton. The number of miscellaneous foreign works, in several\r\nEuropean languages, is noticeable, many of which had been published but\r\na short time before Selden's death. In curious contrast to the character\r\nof the greater part of his collection (rich in classics and science,\r\ntheology and history, law and Hebrew literature) there occurs one\r\nvolume (marked 4^o C. 32. Art. Seld.) which is priceless in the eyes of\r\nthe lovers of old English black-letter tracts. It contains twenty-six\r\ntracts (most bearing the name of a previous possessor, one Thomas\r\nNewton) which are among the rarest of early popular tales and romances.\r\nAs mere specimens of the collection may be mentioned, _Richard Cuer de\r\nLyon_, _Syr Bevis of Hampton_ (unique edit.?), _Syr Degore_, _Syr\r\nTryamoure_ (only two copies known), _Syr Eglamoure_ (unique?), _Dan Hew\r\nof Leicestre_ (unique?), _Battayle of Egyngecourt_ (unique?), _Mylner of\r\nAbyngton_ (unique?), _Wyl Bucke_, _&c._ Among the MSS. is one of\r\nHarding's _Chronicle_ (Arch. Seld. B. 10) which appears to have belonged\r\nto Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, from his arms being painted at\r\nthe end, and which some have supposed was also a presentation copy to\r\nEdward IV. A curious map accompanies the description of Scotland (here\r\ngiven in prose, not, as in the printed editions, in verse), in which,\r\nnext to Sutherland and Caithness, the author, who would have won Dr.\r\nJohnson's respect as being 'a good hater,' places 'Styx, the infernal\r\nflode,' and 'The palais of Pluto, King of hel, _neighbore to Scottz_.'\r\nThis map was engraved for the first time in Gough's _British\r\nTopography_, vol. ii. pl. viii.; the description of it occupies pp.\r\n579-583 in that volume. Another interesting volume is a copy of the\r\nLatin _Articles_ of 1562, printed by Reginald Wolfe in 1563, with the\r\nautograph signatures of the members of the Lower House of Convocation\r\n(Arch. Seld. A. 76). Fifty-four Greek MSS. are described in Mr. Coxe's\r\nCatalogue, vol. i. cols. 583-648.\r\n\r\n[109] As Aubrey (_Lives_, with _Letters by Eminent Persons_, ii. 532)\r\nhas preserved a story that Selden on his death-bed refused, through\r\nHobbes' persuasion, to see a clergyman (Mr Johnson) who was coming 'to\r\nassoile him,' it is worth while to print the following notice of his\r\ndeath from Rawlinson MS. B. clviii. fol. 75, a volume containing a\r\ncollection of biographical anecdotes, &c., written in a rather clumsy\r\ncopyist's hand, about the beginning of the last century: 'Mr. Selden\r\nupon his death-bed disclaimed all Hobbisme and the like wicked and\r\nAtheisticall opinions, commanded that neither Mr. Hobbs nor Capt.\r\nRossingham should be admitted to him, confessed his sins, and desired\r\nabsolution, which was given him by Archbp. Usher; but amongst other\r\nthings he much deplored the loss of his time in studying of things more\r\ncurious than usefull, and wished that he [had] rather executed the\r\noffice of a justice of peace than spent his time in that which the world\r\ncalls learning.'\r\n\r\n[110] See also Aubrey's _Lives_, _ut supra_, ii. 536.\r\n\r\n[111] Nichols (_Lit. Anecd._ i. 333) gives another and very different\r\nstory, for which he produces no authority. He says that Selden had\r\nactually sent his library to Oxford during his lifetime, but hearing\r\nthat they had lent out a book _without sufficient caution_, he sent for\r\nit back again.\r\n\r\n[112] Twells' Life of Pococke, in Pococke's _Theol. Works_, 1740, vol.\r\ni. p. 43.\r\n\r\n[113] Reg. Conv. T. p. 251. It is added, as an additional reason for the\r\nconcession, 'porro spes sit virum in rem nostram academicam optime\r\naffectum, hanc ei extra ordinem gratiam factam abunde olim\r\ncompensaturum.'\r\n\r\n[114] A copy also exists of this paper made by Hearne with a view to\r\npublication, and, as appears from a short preface by him, from a double\r\nmotive; firstly, to prevent persons taking offence in his own day at\r\nrefusals; secondly, to afford warning to persons with 'fanatical\r\nconsciences,' who seem to have thought there was no harm done in\r\ncarrying books away secretly, provided they returned them again.\r\nUnfortunately 'consciences' such as these still exist, and there is\r\nreason for quoting, with a present application, the words with which the\r\nwarm-hearted Hearne concludes: 'Let these men consider seriously how\r\nthey will answer this before God, and withall assure themselves that if\r\nthey be found out, they will, besides the punishment like to come upon\r\nthem hereafter (without an earnest, hearty repentance) be expos'd to all\r\nthat infamy and disgrace which the Statute enjoyns to be inflicted upon\r\nsuch notorious offenders.' (Misc. MSS. papers relating to the Library.)\r\n\r\nThe first actual theft of a book occurred in 1624. At the Visitation on\r\nNov. 9, the Curators drew up a formal document, publishing and\r\ndenouncing the deed, and exhorting the unknown doer to a timely\r\nrepentance. A copy of it is preserved in volume 23 of Bryan Twyne's\r\nCollections, in the University Archives (p. 683), and runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n'Cum in hac visitatione nostra anniversaria Bibliothecæ Bodleianæ, post\r\ndiligentem et religiosam status ejus pro officii nostri ratione\r\nexaminationem factam, compertum sit volumen unum (Jod.

Professor Regius.\r\n  JOHANNES SOUTH, Græcæ Linguæ Prælector Regius.'\r\n\r\nMore serious abstractions, however, than such as these, have lately\r\n(_i.e._ within the last twenty or thirty years) been practised. It has\r\nrecently been discovered that two extremely rare tracts by Thomas\r\nChurchyard, his _Epitaph of Sir P. Sidney_, and _Feast full of sad\r\nCheere_, have been cut out of the volume of tracts in which they were\r\nbound up. May it be hoped that Book-lovers, as well as lovers of\r\nhonesty, will remember this, should unknown copies suddenly come to\r\nlight? Another book, mentioned by Warton as being in Tanner's\r\ncollection, _The Children of the Chapel Stript and Whipt_, is also not\r\nforthcoming; but no trace of its actual existence at any time within the\r\nwalls of the Library has, as yet, been found. As in the course of making\r\na new General Catalogue of the whole library, every separate volume and\r\ntract is now conspicuously stamped with the name of its _locale_, it is\r\nhoped that depredations of this character will be entirely checked.\r\n\r\nTwo instances, however, in which 'consciences' have been sufficiently\r\nawakened to make restitution of stolen goods, have occurred within the\r\nlast twenty years. In 185- (exact year forgotten), on a day on which a\r\nConvocation had been held on some exciting subject, which had\r\nconsequently brought up country voters from all parts, the present\r\nwriter happened to notice that a small book had been laid in a shelf of\r\nfolios near the Library door. Taking it up, he found it to be a rare\r\nvolume of tracts by J. Preston and T. Goodwin, printed at Amsterdam, and\r\nbearing a Library reference. On proceeding to restore it to its place,\r\nthat place was found to be occupied by another book; this, of course,\r\nled to further examination, and it was then discovered that the former\r\nvolume had been missing for so many years, that at last, all hope of its\r\nrecovery being abandoned, its place had been filled up. The old\r\nregister-books of readers were then ransacked, and at length an entry\r\nwas found of the delivery of this book to a reader, who was still living\r\nat the time of this Convocation, on Feb. 14, 1807. A quarto volume was\r\nalso found about the same time thrust in amongst other quartos in a\r\nshelf near the door, but the particulars of this case have been\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nA third case of recovery, but of a different kind, occurred in 1851. In\r\nthe year 1789 the Library was visited by Hen. E. G. Paulus, of Jena,\r\nafterwards the too-well-known author of the _Leben Jesu_, who copied\r\nfrom Pococke MS. 32 (a small octavo volume) an Arabic translation of\r\nIsaiah made, in Hebrew characters, by R. Saadiah, which he published in\r\nthe following year, transposed into Arabic characters. Thenceforward the\r\nMS. was lost from the Library, although no direct evidence of the manner\r\nof its disappearance appears to have been obtained. But after the death\r\nof Paulus in the year 1850, a bookseller at Breslau, to whom the volume\r\nhad in some way been offered, entered into communication with the\r\nLibrarian, Dr. Bandinel, and the result was that the missing MS. was at\r\nlength restored, _clothed in an entirely different German binding_, and\r\nwith all trace of its original ownership removed, to its right place.\r\nThe abstraction of this MS. 'by an Oriental professor,' and its\r\nrecovery, are mentioned, without further particulars, by Dr. Pusey, in\r\nhis Evidence printed in the _University Report upon the Recommendations\r\nof the University Commissioners_, 1853. p. 171.\r\n\r\n[115] Bodley frequently in his letters expresses his positive\r\ndetermination not to allow books to be removed from the Library by any\r\nmeans. He mentions the having connived at first at Sir H. Savile's\r\nhaving a book for a very short space of time, because he was like to\r\nbecome a very great benefactor; but declares that after the making the\r\nStatutes neither he nor any one else shall be allowed the same liberty\r\nupon any occasion whatsoever. (_Reliquiæ Bodl._ pp. 176, 264.) And in\r\nanother letter he says, in reference to a particular application, 'The\r\nsending of any book out of the Library may be assented to by no means,\r\nneither is it a matter that the University or Vice-Chancellor are to\r\ndeal in. It cannot stand with my publick resolution with the University,\r\nand my denial made to the Bishop of Glocester and the rest of the\r\nInterpreters [_i.e._ the Translators of the Authorized Version of the\r\nBible] in their assembly in Christ Church, who requested the like at my\r\nhands for one or two books.' (_Ibid._ p. 207.) In 1636 the University\r\nrefused leave to Archbishop Laud to borrow Rob. Hare's MS. _Liber\r\nPrivilegiorum Universitatis_ (compiled in 1592), when the Archbishop was\r\nprosecuting his claim to visit the two Universities as Metropolitan. But\r\nthe refusal was doubtless rather from jealousy respecting their\r\nimmunities (as Wood says) than from regard to the rules of the Library\r\n(Huber's _English Universities_, by F. Newman, vol. ii. p. 45.) However,\r\nthe book was at last produced before the Council. (Wood's _Hist. and\r\nAntiq._, by Gutch, vol. ii. p. 403.)\r\n\r\n[116] 'Μυριοβιβλος, num. 131' [Barocci].\r\n\r\n[117] These were gold coins, of the value of fifteen shillings, which\r\nderived their name from bearing a star on the reverse which resembled\r\nthe rowel of a spur.\r\n\r\n[118] A few of these coins are still preserved in an ancient chest in\r\nthe same room where they were of old deposited. Here is also carefully\r\npreserved a very large and valuable collection of early charters,\r\nincluding all which belonged to the Hospital of St. John Bapt. upon the\r\nsite of which the College was built, and to several suppressed priories\r\nwhich were annexed to the College, reaching back to the twelfth century.\r\nOf these the author of this volume is engaged in preparing a MS.\r\ncatalogue, for the use of the College.\r\n\r\n[119] The conditions imposed by the executors (which are printed in\r\nGutch's _Wood_, ii. 943, and elsewhere) expressly stipulated that the\r\nbooks should be chained. As late as the year 1751 notices occur in the\r\nLibrarian's account-books of the procuring additional chains for the\r\nLibrary. But the removal of them appears to have commenced as shortly\r\nafterwards as 1757, and in 1761 there was a payment for unchaining 1448\r\nbooks at one halfpenny each. Several of the chains are still preserved\r\nloose, as relics.\r\n\r\n[120] Ayliffe's _Ancient and Present State of the Univ. of Oxford_,\r\n1714, vol. i. p. 462. Pointer, in his _Oxoniensis Academia_, 1749, p.\r\n136, quotes the account of the Bodleian given by Ayliffe as having been\r\nwritten by Dr. Hudson, under whose name it is also found in Macky's\r\n_Journey through England_ vol. ii. The fire here mentioned was probably\r\nthat which occurred about 1679 or 1680, in which the chambers called the\r\nPaper-Buildings were destroyed, where Selden's rooms were situated. At\r\nLincoln's Inn some MSS. are now amongst Sir M. Hale's.\r\n\r\n[121] This was never recovered, but a later edition, in 1609, was\r\nprocured instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1655.\r\n\r\nThe stipends of the Librarian and Assistants at this time amounted\r\njointly to £51 6_s._ 8_d._ Of this it appears from the account for 1657\r\nthat the Librarian received £33 6_s._ 8_d._, the Second Keeper, then H.\r\nStubbe, £10, and [the janitor] S. Rugleye (?), £8. A volume of curious\r\ntracts, published during the early part of the reign of Charles I, now\r\nmarked 4^o _F. 2 Art. B. S._, furnishes the name of a preceding janitor,\r\nby bearing the inscription, 'Liber Thomæ Roch, defuncti, quondam\r\njanitoris bibliothecæ.' The janitor originally appointed by Bodley\r\nappears to be mentioned in the following passage in a letter from him to\r\nJames: 'There is one Thomas Scott, Under-butler of Magdalen College,\r\nthat hath made means unto me for the Porter's place, whom I propose to\r\nelect[122].'\r\n\r\nJohn Evelyn appears in this year, as well as subsequently, as a donor of\r\nbooks. Nineteen MSS. were given by Peter Whalley, of Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\n[122] _Reliquæ Bodl._ p. 263.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1656.\r\n\r\nCowley's _Poems_. See 1620.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1657.\r\n\r\nIn this year the gifts to the Library, which since 1640 had been but\r\nfew, begin once more to increase in number. Five hundred gold and silver\r\ncoins were given by Ralph Freke, of Hannington, Wilts, and a cabinet for\r\ntheir reception, 'auro gemmisque coruscum,' by his brother William.\r\nAmongst various other donations occur a copy of Caxton's Description of\r\nBritain, 1480, from Ralph Bathurst, M.D., Trinity College, and four\r\nOriental MSS. from William Juxon, 'Londinensis olim Episc.' One entry in\r\nthe Benefaction Register has been at one time carefully pasted over, and\r\nat another brought again to light; it is the record of a gift from _Hugh\r\nPeters_. 'Hugo Peters, serenissimo Britanniarum Protectori Olivero a\r\nsacris, pro sua in academiam et rempubl. literariam benevolentia,\r\ncodices insequentes Bibl. Bodleianæ dono dedit Maii iiii^o, Anno CIƆ.\r\nIƆC. LVII;' viz. the great Dutch Bible with annotations, 'edit. ult.\r\n[scil. Hague, 1637] auro sericoque compacta,' and the Æthiopic Psalter\r\nof 1513. A leaf which followed this entry has been removed from the\r\nRegister, probably because it contained some further particulars of\r\nPeters' gift, or possibly the record of the MSS. presented by the\r\nProtector himself in 1654[123]. The binding of silk and gold has now\r\naltogether disappeared, and the Bible is clad in a plain calf coat, with\r\nno note of its former condition or of its donor.\r\n\r\nFrancis Yonge, M.A. of Oriel College, the Sub-librarian, died in this\r\nyear. In his place succeeded, through the influence of Dr. Owen, Dean of\r\nCh. Ch., Henry Stubbe, M.A., the well-known violent and varying\r\npolitical writer, then a Student of that House. From the posts, however,\r\nof both Librarian and Student Stubbe was ejected in March, 1659, on\r\naccount of the publication of his book entitled, _A Light Shining out of\r\nDarkness_, which was supposed to attack the Universities and clergy.\r\n\r\n[123] See p. 55.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1658.\r\n\r\nGerard Langbaine, D.D., the learned Provost of Queen's College, died on\r\nFeb. 10 in this year. Twenty-one vols. of his _Adversaria_, consisting\r\nchiefly of extracts from Bodleian MSS. and of notes concerning the\r\narrangement of the books in the Library, were bought for £11. Nine other\r\nvolumes were bequeathed by Ant. à Wood in 1695. They are all fully\r\ndescribed by Mr. Coxe in vol. i. [cols. 877-888] of the General\r\nCatalogue of the MSS. of the Library, which appeared in 1853, as well as\r\nmore briefly in Bernard's Catalogue. Besides obtaining his own\r\nautograph collections by purchase, the Library became possessed by\r\nbequest from him of the very valuable MS. (_e Mus. 86_) on the history\r\nof Wickliffe and his followers, entitled _Fasciculi Zizaniorum_, written\r\nby Thomas Walden. This was edited by the late Dr. Shirley in 1858, as\r\npart of the Master of the Rolls' Series of Chronicles. Dr. Shirley\r\ntraced the volume to the hands of Bale and Usher, but was not aware of\r\nthe way in which it came to the Library.\r\n\r\nThe effect which civil war and confusion had had upon literature may be\r\ncommercially estimated by the fact that a gift of £5 from Joseph\r\nMaynard, B.D., of Exeter College, proved sufficient for the purchase of\r\n28 printed volumes and 11 MSS., many of which were curious.\r\n\r\nA crocodile, from Jamaica, was given by John Desborow, the republican\r\nMajor-General, and brother-in-law to the Protector.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1659.\r\n\r\nThomas Hyde, M.A., of Queen's College, was appointed Under-keeper on the\r\nexpulsion of Henry Stubbe.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1660.\r\n\r\nThomas Barlow, D.D. (who had been elected Provost of Queen's College in\r\n1658), resigned the Librarianship on Sept. 25, in consequence of his\r\nappointment to the Margaret Professorship of Divinity. Thomas Lockey,\r\nB.D., Student of Ch. Ch., was elected in his place, on Sept. 28, by 102\r\nvotes to 80, over Mr. [John] Good, M.A., Balliol College[124].\r\n\r\nA curious story is preserved by Wanley and Dr. Wallis, in memoranda,\r\ndated 1698-1701, on the fly-leaves of a copy of the rare _Index Librorum\r\nprohibitorum_ printed at Madrid in 1612-14 (4^o U. 46. Th.), respecting\r\nthe visit of a Roman Catholic priest to the Library during the period of\r\nBarlow's headship. In the course of conversation with Barlow, the priest\r\ndenied that such a book as this Index had ever been printed at Madrid\r\n(there being various discrepancies between it and the Roman Index),\r\nwhereupon this copy was produced, bearing the names of several\r\ninquisitors who had from time to time possessed it. The visitor was\r\nextremely surprised, and, being very desirous of purchasing it, offered\r\nany sum for it that might be demanded, with the intent (as the somewhat\r\nsuspicious tellers of the tale suggest) to destroy it; but the Doctor\r\nwas above corruption. The vigilance of the Librarians being aroused, the\r\nbook was removed from an exposed place where it had formerly been kept,\r\nto a less accessible situation in the gallery, and securely chained.\r\nWallis adds that one fly-leaf, containing some of the previous owners'\r\nnames, had since then been torn out[125].\r\n\r\n[124] Reg. Convoc. T^a. 27, p. 57.\r\n\r\n[125] The memoranda are printed in Mendham's _Lit. Policy of the Church\r\nof Rome_, second edit., pp. 152-4, and in Bliss' _Reliquiæ Hearnianæ_,\r\ni. 12-14.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1662.\r\n\r\nA legacy of £50 was paid which had been bequeathed some time previously\r\nby Alex. Ross, now-a-days best known as the Ross of Hudibrastic memory.\r\nIt is singular that a copy of the old printed quarto catalogue of the\r\nLibrary was amongst the books purchased with this gift; which shows\r\nthat, within forty years after publication, it had become scarce even in\r\nthe Library itself.\r\n\r\nFive Arabic and eight Chinese MSS. were given by William Thurston, a\r\nLondon merchant. By a mistaken arrangement of various other small gifts,\r\nThurston now passes as the donor of forty Arabic, Persian, and Syriac\r\nMSS., instead of five. Several of these, at present all numbered alike\r\nas Thurston MSS., were given in 1684 by Jos. Taylor, LL.D., of St.\r\nJohn's College, one by Crewe, Bishop of Durham, in 1680, one by Benj.\r\nPolsted, a London African merchant, in 1678, one by Charles Robson,\r\nB.D., Queen's College, about 1630, and one is an Armenian poem of thanks\r\nfor benefits received from the University, presented by the author, Jac.\r\nde Gregoriis, an Armenian priest, in 1674. One other volume (a\r\nmathematical MS. bought at Constantinople, by Const. Ravius, in 1641)\r\nwas at one time, as it appears, abstracted from the Library, and was\r\nrestored by means of Dr. Marshall, who, after the words 'Liber\r\nBibliothecæ Bodleianæ Oxon.' has added the following note: 'quem ex\r\nRatelbandi cujusdam bibliopolæ officina libraria, prope novum templum\r\nAmstelodami, redimendum pretio persoluto curavit Tho. Mareschallus, e\r\nCollegio Lincolniensi apud Oxonienses.'\r\n\r\nThe first statutory obligation upon the Stationers' Company to deliver a\r\ncopy of each book printed by them to this Library, together with that of\r\nCambridge and the Royal Library, was imposed by the act of 14 Chas. II.\r\nc. 33, for two years, which was renewed from time to time until the\r\npassing of the Copyright Act of 8 Q. Anne.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1663.\r\n\r\nThe University was visited in September by Charles II and his Queen. And\r\n'on Munday, September 28, about four in the afternoon, the University,\r\nbeing in their Formalities placed from Christ Church east-gate to the\r\nsouth gate of the publique Schooles, the King and Queen, the Duke and\r\nDutches of Yorke, with the nobility and gentry attending, went to the\r\nSchooles, where the Chanceller, Vice-Chanceller and Heads of Houses\r\nreceived them, and invited them up to the Library; and Mr. Crew, the\r\nSenior Proctor, placed neer the globes, addrest himselfe to their\r\nMajesties in an oration upon his knees; which being ended, the King and\r\nQueen, with the Royal Family and nobility, were by our Chanceller,\r\nVice-Chanceller, and the Heads of Houses, conducted to Selden's Library,\r\nand there entertained with a very sumptuous banquett[126].'\r\n\r\n[126] Reg. Convoc. T^a. 27, p. 173.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1664.\r\n\r\nJames Lamb, of St. Mary Hall, D.D. and Canon of Westminster, died in\r\nthis year. Nine MSS. volumes, written by him, consisting of collections\r\nfor an Arabic Lexicon and Grammar, together with the book of Daniel, in\r\nSyriac, are preserved in the Library, and form a small separate\r\ncollection under his name.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1665.\r\n\r\nThomas Lockey, D.D., resigned the Librarianship, on Nov. 29, 1665, in\r\nconsequence of his appointment to a canonry of Ch. Ch. In the following\r\nyear he gave some coins and the sum of £6 16_s._ In his place was\r\nelected, on Dec. 2, Thomas Hyde, M.A., of Queen's College, then\r\nUnder-keeper. Upon Lockey's death, in 1680, books to the value of £16\r\n15_s._ were bought out of his study.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1666.\r\n\r\nTwenty MSS. were given by Sir Thos. Herbert, Bart. of York.\r\n\r\nAn East India merchant of London, one John Ken, gave (with other MSS.)\r\nthe first Gentoo [i.e. Sanscrit.] book which the Library possessed. It\r\nis noticeable what a real, although somewhat indiscriminating, interest\r\nthe London merchants appear to have taken in the Library. Continual\r\nmention occurs not merely of books but of curiosities of all kinds,\r\nnatural and artificial, which persons engaged in commerce, chiefly with\r\nthe East Indies, sent as for a general repository. Most of these\r\ncuriosities are now to be found, it is believed, in the Ashmolean\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nAt some period between 1660 and 1667, _i.e._ during Clarendon's\r\nChancellorship of the University, two volumes of MSS. notes and\r\nobservations upon Josephus, by Sam. Petit, the Professor of Greek at\r\nNismes (who died in 1643), are said by Moreri to have been purchased by\r\nClarendon, for 150 louis d'or, and given to the University. But in\r\nBernard's Catalogue the volumes are said to have been bought by the\r\nUniversity 'ære suo.' Dr. T. Smith remarks, in his life of Bernard, that\r\nwhen the latter was preparing to edit Josephus, he used 'Sam. Petiti\r\nlargis commentariis, longe antea in bibliothecæ Bodleianæ gazophylacium\r\nex Gallia transvectis,' but found that they were filled only with notes\r\nfrom Rabbinical writers. They are now numbered Auct. F. infra, I. 1, 2.\r\nOne other MS. was certainly given by Clarendon, during his\r\nChancellorship. It is a Greek _Evangelistarium_ of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, formerly the property of a monastery described as 'της παναγιας\r\nτης αχειροποιητου,' which was given by Parthenius, Patriarch of\r\nConstantinople, to Heneage Finch, Earl of Winchelsea, when in Turkey, in\r\n1661, as Ambassador from England, and subsequently given by Clarendon to\r\nthe University. On the cover is a silver crucifix, of Byzantine work. It\r\nis now numbered Auct. D. infra II. 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1668.\r\n\r\nJohn Davies, of Camberwell, the storekeeper at Deptford dockyard, caused\r\na chair to be made out of the remains of the ship, 'The Golden Hind,' in\r\nwhich Sir F. Drake accomplished his voyage round the world, which had\r\nbeen kept at Deptford until the timber decayed, and presented it to the\r\nLibrary. It stands now in the Picture Gallery, beside a chair which is\r\nsaid (but on what authority is not known) to have belonged to Henry\r\nVIII[127], and bears a plate on which are inscribed some verses, in\r\nLatin and English, by Abraham Cowley. A good engraving of it is to be\r\nfound in Lascelles' and Storer's _Oxford_, published in 1821[128], and\r\nin the _Life of Drake_, published in 1828.\r\n\r\n[127] The style of moulding on the back seems to point to a somewhat\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\n[128] A description, including a copy of the verses, and illustrated by\r\na woodcut, is also to be found in vol. xxix. (1837) of the _Mirror_, p.\r\n8, copied from the _Nautical Magazine_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1670.\r\n\r\nThirteen Oriental MSS. (chiefly in their possessor's own writing) were\r\nbought from the heirs of Samuel Clarke, M.A., of Merton College, printer\r\nto the University and Esquire Bedel of Law, who died Dec. 17, 1669. He\r\nwas greatly distinguished as an Orientalist, and assisted in the\r\nproduction of Walton's Polyglott. A list of his MSS. is given in\r\nBernard's Catalogue, and another, by Prof. Nicoll, _Ath. Oxon._ iii.\r\n885. He himself gave four printed Arabic books in 1663.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1671.\r\n\r\nUpon the death of Meric Casaubon, on July 14, the Library became\r\npossessed, by his bequest, of sixty-one volumes of the _Adversaria_\r\n(chiefly consisting of notes on Greek criticism) of his father, Isaac\r\nCasaubon, who died in 1614. From these Jo. Christ. Wolf made some\r\nextracts when visiting the Library in 1709, which he published in the\r\nfollowing year at Hamburgh, under the title of _Casauboniana_, with a\r\npreface giving some account of all previous collections of _Ana_, and\r\nwith copious notes. The MSS. are catalogued in Mr. Coxe's first volume,\r\ncols. 825-850.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1673.\r\n\r\nThomas, Lord Fairfax, to whose care the Library had been indebted for\r\npreservation in 1646, bequeathed to it on his decease, in November,\r\n1671, twenty-eight very valuable MSS., including several early English\r\nbooks (Chaucer, Gower, Wickliffe's Bible, &c.) and works relating to the\r\nhistory of England, Scotland (Elphinston[129]), and Ireland (Keating).\r\nBut besides these, he gave that invaluable collection of genealogical\r\nMSS. known to all pedigree-hunters by the name of their indefatigable\r\ncompiler, Roger Dodsworth, to whom he had allowed an annuity of £40\r\nduring his life, in order to enable him the better to prosecute his\r\nresearches. This collection numbers 161 volumes (bound in 86) in folio\r\nand quarto[130], and consists of extracts bearing chiefly on the family\r\nand ecclesiastical history of Yorkshire and the North of England, with\r\nan innumerable mass of pedigrees, from all the authentic records within\r\nDodsworth's reach, including many which were destroyed when the Tower of\r\nSt. Mary, at York, was blown up during the siege of that city in June,\r\n1644. He appears to have commenced this wonderful series of notes about\r\nthe year 1618, and not to have ceased before 1652, dying, in the\r\nseventieth year of his age, in August, 1654. Besides the very full\r\ncatalogue of his MSS. which is given by Bernard (pp. 187-233), an\r\nextremely useful and original synopsis of their contents, prefaced with\r\nan account of Dodsworth's life and labours, and drawn up by Mr. Joseph\r\nHunter, is to be found in the Report of the Record Commission for 1837;\r\nwhich was reprinted by Mr. Hunter, in an octavo volume, in 1838,\r\ntogether with a list of the contents of the Red Book of the Exchequer,\r\nand a Catalogue of the MSS. in Lincoln's Inn. After the MSS. were\r\nbrought to the Library, they became in some way exposed to the damp,\r\n'and were in danger of being spoiled by a wet season.' Fortunately the\r\ndanger was perceived by Ant. à Wood, who obtained leave of the\r\nVice-Chancellor to dry them, which he accomplished by spreading them out\r\nin the sun upon the leads of the Schools' quadrangle. This cost him a\r\nmonth's labour, which, he says, he underwent with pleasure out of\r\nrespect to the memory of Dodsworth, and care to preserve whatever might\r\nadvantage the commonwealth of learning. The MSS. to this day give\r\nabundant proof, by their stains and tender condition, that, had it not\r\nbeen for Wood's unselfish labour, they would probably soon have\r\nperished. Some part of the collection appears to have been sent to the\r\nLibrary as late as 1684, for in the accounts of that year there is an\r\nentry of 4_s._ 10_d._ as having been paid for the 'carriage of\r\nDodsworth's MSS.'\r\n\r\nAn interesting volume, written by the donor of these MSS., Fairfax, and\r\nentitled by him 'The Employment of my Solitude,' being metrical versions\r\nof the Psalms, with other poems, was bought, in 1858, for £36 10_s._, at\r\nthe sale of the library of Dr. Bliss, who had purchased it at the Duke\r\nof Sussex's sale. It is described in Archdeacon Cotton's List of Bibles.\r\n\r\n[129] A transcript of Elphinston's Chronicle is to be found among the\r\nJones MSS.\r\n\r\n[130] No. 20 is a volume of Camden's Collections, formerly in the Cotton\r\nLibrary, Julius B. x., from whence Dodsworth must have borrowed it, and\r\nwhither, with an obliviousness too common in book-borrowers, he must\r\nhave forgotten to return it. And No. 161 was given to the Library by Mr.\r\nFras. Drake, the historian of York, in 1736.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1674.\r\n\r\nIn this year appeared the third _Catalogus impressorum Librorum\r\nBibliothecæ Bodleianæ_, in one folio volume, divided into two parts of\r\n478 and 272 pages respectively. It is dedicated to Archbishop Sheldon,\r\nby Hyde the Librarian, not without reason, as being printed in that\r\nTheatre which the Archbishop had so lately built. The Keeper, in this\r\ndedication, speaks very feelingly of the daily weariness of mind and\r\nbody which the compilation of the Catalogue had cost him, and tells how\r\nhis very hours for refreshment had been spent among books alone, and how\r\n(_mirabile dictu!_) he actually had not shrunk even from the\r\ninclemency of winter[131]. In his preface he says that, on his entrance\r\ninto office, he reckoned that the work of a new catalogue would occupy\r\nhim for two, or at most three, years; six, however, had been spent in\r\ncompilation and transcription, one in revision and enlargement, and,\r\nlastly, two in the actual printing. Yet, says he, he never withdrew his\r\nneck from the yoke, and postponed all considerations of bodily health.\r\nPeople little know, he proceeds, what it is to accomplish a work of this\r\nkind. What is easier, say they, than to look at the beginning of a book\r\nand to copy out its title? They judge only from one or two weeks' work\r\nin some little library of their own. But, what with careful examining of\r\nvolumes of pamphlets (which of itself was labour perfectly exhausting),\r\nwhat with distinguishing synonymous authors and works, and identifying\r\nmetonymous ones, unravelling anagrammatical names and those derived from\r\nplaces, and the like, the poor man declares he endured the greatest\r\ntorment of mind ('maximo animi cruciatu') as well as waste of precious\r\ntime. It is clear, from these pathetic lamentations, that Hyde had no\r\ngreat love for Bibliography for its own sake. But, after all his\r\ncomplaints, it is actually asserted by Hearne that he 'did not do much\r\nin the work besides writing the dedication and preface[132]!' Hearne\r\nattributes the real compilation of the Catalogue to Emmanuel Prichard,\r\nor Pritchard, of Hart Hall, the janitor, who examined every book in the\r\nwhole library, and wrote out the Catalogue, in two volumes, with his own\r\nhand. Hearne repeats this assertion frequently; it is found, _e.g._, in\r\nhis preface to the _Chronicon Dunstap._ p. xii., and in his\r\n_Autobiography_ (1772, p. 11), where he adds that he was well informed\r\nof this by Dr. Mill and others. If this be true, the inditing such a\r\npreface, while totally suppressing Prichard's name, does little credit\r\nto Hyde.\r\n\r\nFrequent mention of this Emmanuel Prichard is found between 1686 and\r\n1699 as being employed upon the MSS., and as engaged in taking an\r\naccount of duplicates and arranging Bishop Barlow's books. In 1687, £20\r\nwere paid him for 'writing a Catalogue of MSS.' Probably this was the\r\nlist upon which Hearne asserts that the index to the Bodleian MSS., in\r\nBernard's Catalogue, was founded[133]. Hearne describes him[134] as\r\nbeing 'a very industrious, usefull man.' Although a member of Hart Hall,\r\nhe never took any degree; but wore a civilian's gown. He died in the\r\nHall about 1704, aged upwards of 70, and was buried in St.\r\nPeter's-in-the-East. He left £200 to the Vice-Principal of Hart Hall,\r\nwhich was partly spent in building a library-room[135].\r\n\r\n[131] Of the 'hyemis inclementia' before the present system of warming\r\nthe Library was introduced, several of the present staff of officers can\r\nspeak as feelingly as Hyde. The writer remembers, in particular, one\r\nwinter when, in consequence of the roof being under repair, the\r\nthermometer fell some eleven degrees below freezing point!\r\n\r\n[132] _MS. Diary_, 1714, vol. ii. p. 193.\r\n\r\n[133] _Reliquiæ Hearn._ ii. 591. But see p. 116, _infra_.\r\n\r\n[134] _MS. Diary_, li. 193.\r\n\r\n[135] Hearne's _MS. Diary_, ciii. 38.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1675.\r\n\r\nIn the Register of Benefactions, on a page faintly headed in pencil with\r\nthis date, is entered a gift from Christopher, Lord Hatton, 'Homiliarum\r\nSaxonicarum 4 volumina antiqua.' The donor was consequently the second\r\nbaron, and first viscount, Hatton, who succeeded his father Christopher\r\n(a firm royalist, and close friend of Clarendon, as well as antiquarian,\r\nand friend of Dodsworth) in 1670, and died in 1706. Possibly this gift\r\nmay have been made through the influence of his uncle, Capt. Charles\r\nHatton, who appears to have been much interested in Anglo-Saxon studies,\r\nwho himself gave three MSS. to the Library, and several of whose letters\r\nto Dr. Charlett in 1694-1707 are preserved in vol. xxxiii. of Ballard's\r\nMSS. Strange to say, these volumes of Homilies (written shortly after\r\nthe Norman Conquest) are now among the Junian MSS., Nos. 22, 23, 24, 99,\r\nand their appearance in that collection is accounted for by Wanley\r\n(_Cat._ p. 45, where they are fully described) by a story which, he\r\nsays, was often told him by Hyde, viz. that, immediately upon the\r\narrival of the MSS. at the Library, they were lent to Dr. Marshall, who\r\nmost probably in turn lent them to Junius; that, Marshall dying soon\r\nafter, Junius kept them until his own death, when they returned to the\r\nLibrary with his own books, by his bequest. Junius himself frequently\r\nrefers to them under the description of _Codices Hattoniani_.\r\n\r\nThe Library also contains a collection of 112 miscellaneous and valuable\r\nMSS., 'ex Codicibus Hattonianis,' of the presentation of which no record\r\nhas been found[136], but which doubtless came about the same time from\r\nthe same donor. Some precious Anglo-Saxon volumes form the special\r\nfeature of this collection. Amongst them are, King Alfred's translation\r\nof Gregory's _Pastoral Care_, of which the king designed to send a copy\r\nto each Cathedral Church in the kingdom, this being the copy sent to\r\nWorcester (No. 20); the translation by Werfrith, Bishop of Worcester, of\r\nGregory's _Dialogues_, with King Alfred's preface (No. 76); and a\r\nversion of the Four Gospels, written about the time of Henry II (No.\r\n65).\r\n\r\nHenry Justell, afterwards Librarian at St. James's, sent to the\r\nUniversity from France, through Dr. Hickes, three very precious MSS. of\r\nthe seventh century, written in uncial characters, containing the Acts\r\nof the Council of Ephesus, the Canons of Carthage, Nicæa, Chalcedon, &c.,\r\nwhich had been used by his father Christopher Justell in his\r\n_Bibliotheca Juris Canonici veteris_, 1661. They are now numbered, _e\r\nMus._ 100-102. Several other MSS. given at the same time are preserved\r\nin the same series. In return for this valuable gift Justell was created\r\nD.C.L. by diploma.\r\n\r\n[136] The Register has evidently been kept very irregularly and\r\nimperfectly during the time that Barlow and Hyde held the headship.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1677.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful collection of Early English poetry known as 'the Vernon\r\nMS.,' was presented 'soon after the Civil Wars' by Col. Edward Vernon,\r\nof Trinity College, who had been an officer in the royal army. One who\r\nbore the same name, doubtless the same person, of North Aston, Oxon, was\r\ncreated D.C.L. Aug. 6, 1677; it was probably therefore about that time\r\nthat the MS. was presented. The volume is described in Bernard's\r\nCatalogue, 1697, p. 181, as being a 'vast massy manuscript;' and very\r\ncorrectly. Its measurements are these: length of page, 22-1/2 inches;\r\nlength of written text, 17-1/2 inches; breadth of page, 15 inches;\r\nbreadth of written text, 12-1/2 inches. It is written in triple columns,\r\non 412 leaves of stout vellum; and having been clad of late years in a\r\nproportionate russia binding, is altogether a Goliath among books. In\r\ndate it is of the early part of the fourteenth century. Its first\r\narticle bears the titles of 'Salus Animæ' and 'Sowle-Hele,' and its\r\nchief contents are Lives of the Saints, Hampole's _Prick of Conscience_,\r\nGrosteste's _Castle of Love_, Hampole's _Perfect Living_, the treatise\r\non _Contemplative Life_, the _Mirror of S. Edmund_, the _Abbey of the\r\nHoly Ghost_, and _Piers Plowman_; besides a multitude of smaller pieces,\r\nseveral of which have been recently copied with a view to publication by\r\nthe Early English Text Society[137]. Fifty copies of a brief list of the\r\ncontents (numbering altogether 161 articles) were printed by J. O.\r\nHalliwell, Esq., in 1848. A MS., similar in size and contents, was\r\npresented to the British Museum a few years ago by Sir John Simeon; it\r\nis, apparently, the work of the same scribe as the Bodleian book.\r\n\r\n[137] This Society has also just issued Part 1. of Piers Plowman from\r\nthis MS., edited by W. W. Skeat, M.A. (Oct. 1867).\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1678.\r\n\r\nFrancis Junius, born at Heidelberg in 1589, who had passed a large part\r\nof his life in England as librarian to that Howard Earl of Arundel who\r\ncollected the marbles which go under his name at Oxford, as well as the\r\nMSS. similarly entitled, which are preserved in the British Museum and\r\nat Heralds' College, bequeathed to the Library, on his decease at\r\nWindsor in this year, all his Anglo-Saxon MSS. and his own life-long\r\ncollections bearing on the philology of the Northern nations. Amongst\r\nthese are some English relics of the greatest value and importance. The\r\nbook of metrical Homilies on the Dominical Gospels, compiled by an\r\nAugustinian monk named Ormin, who thence called his book _Ormulum_ ([OE:\r\n'þiss boc iss nemmnedd Orrmulum, Forrþi þatt Orrm itt wrohte']) is one\r\nof the chief of these. Its date is conjectured to be the 13th century.\r\nIt is written on parchment, on folio leaves, very long and very narrow\r\n(averaging 20 inches by 8) in a very broad and rude hand, with many\r\nadditions inserted on extra parchment scraps. Twenty-seven leaves appear\r\nto be wanting. The whole work was first published in 2 vols., at the\r\nUniversity Press in 1852, under the editorship of R. M. White, D.D.,\r\nformerly Professor of Anglo-Saxon. Cædmon's metrical paraphrase of\r\nGenesis and other parts of Holy Scripture, illustrated with numerous\r\ncurious drawings, is another of the gems of this collection. The MS. is\r\nof the end of the tenth century, but the work itself is now generally\r\nbelieved to be, in the main, the production of the earliest English\r\npoet, the Cædmon noticed by Bede (iii. 24), who died towards the close\r\nof the seventh century, and not, as Hickes conjectured, of some later\r\nwriter of the same name. The MS. first came to light in the hands of\r\nArchbp. Usher, by whom it was given to Junius. The latter published it\r\nat Amsterdam in 1655, and it was re-edited by Mr. Benj. Thorpe in 1832;\r\nseveral English and German translations have also appeared. Many of the\r\ndrawings were engraved and published in 1754, as illustrations of the\r\nmanners and buildings of the Anglo-Saxons; and the whole of them have\r\nbeen engraved in vol. xxiv. of the _Archæologia_, with some remarks by\r\nSir H. Ellis. MS. 121 is an extremely valuable collection of the Canons\r\nof the Anglo-Saxon Church, written in the tenth century, which belonged\r\nto Worcester Cathedral; and there are four valuable volumes of Homilies,\r\nwhich appear, however, to have been part of Lord Hatton's gift to the\r\nLibrary. (See under 1675[138].) Besides books, Junius left to the\r\nUniversity six founts of Gothic, Saxon, and other types, together with\r\nthe moulds and matrices.\r\n\r\nFifty-five MSS. and printed books, chiefly Oriental, were purchased in\r\nthis year from the library of Dr. Thomas Greaves, Deputy-professor of\r\nArabic, who died May 22, 1676. It appears from the list in Bernard's\r\nCatalogue that sixty-five volumes were purchased, but that ten of these\r\nwere never sent. With Greaves' own books were obtained also the MSS. of\r\nRichard James, of Corpus Christi College, nephew of Thomas James, the\r\nfirst Librarian, which had come into the possession of his friend\r\nGreaves upon his death in Dec. 1638. These amount to forty-three\r\nvolumes, entirely written by James himself, in a large bold hand; they\r\nconsist chiefly of _Collectanea_ bearing on the history of England from\r\nvarious MSS. Chronicles, Registers, and early writers, particularly with\r\nreference to the corruption of the Church and clergy before the\r\nReformation, and in opposition to Becket. A full list of their contents,\r\ndrawn up by Tanner, is given at pp. 248-253 of Bernard's Catalogue. The\r\nprice paid for the books bought out of Greaves' library was £55.\r\n\r\nFifteen shillings were paid, as appears from the accounts for the year,\r\nfor the carriage of a whale from Lechlade, which, strange to say, had\r\nbeen caught in the Severn, and was presented by William Jordan, an\r\napothecary at Gloucester[139]. Ten shillings were also paid for a 'sea\r\nelephant.'\r\n\r\n[138] Parts of MSS. 4 and 5, which had been stolen from the Library,\r\nwere recovered, in 1720, in the manner recorded in the following entry\r\nin the Benefaction Book: 'Vir doctissimus Joannes Georgius Eckardus,\r\nbibliothecæ Brunsvicensis præfectus, pro singulari sua humanitate, folia\r\nquammulta MSS. Dictionarii Fr. Junii, continentia sc. litteras F. et S.,\r\na nequissimo quodam Dano jam olim surrepta, propriis sumptibus redemit\r\net Bibl. Bodl. ultro restituit.' Some further portions of Junius' papers\r\n(including some which had formerly been in the Library) are recorded to\r\nhave been given in 1753 by the Provost and Fellows of Queen's College.\r\n\r\n[139] In the Benefaction Book this gift is assigned to the year 1672.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1680. [See A.D. 1665.]\r\n\r\nSir W. Dugdale gave copies of his own works. Two hundred coins were\r\ngiven by Dr. George Hickes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1681.\r\n\r\nIn this year John Rushworth, of Lincoln's Inn, the historian of the Long\r\nParliament, was a member of the Parliament held at Oxford. Probably it\r\nmay have been at this time that he presented to the Library one of its\r\nmost precious κειμηλια, called, from its donor, 'Codex\r\nRushworthianus.' (Auct. D. 2. 19.) In 1665, Junius mentions it in the\r\nPreface to his _Glossarium Gothicum_, as being then still in Rushworth's\r\nown hands[140]. It is a MS. of the Latin Gospels, written by an Irish\r\nscribe, Mac-Regol, (who records his name on the last leaf, 'Macregol\r\ndipincxit hoc evangelium,' &c.,) and glossed with an interlinear\r\nAnglo-Saxon version by Owun and by Færmen, a priest at Harewood. The\r\nvolume is traditionally reported to have been in Bede's possession, but\r\nsince the Irish annals record the death of Mac Riagoil, a scribe and\r\nabbot of Birr in 820, the volume must be about a century too late. It\r\nhas been published in full, together with the Lindisfarne Gospels, by\r\nthe Surtees Society in 3 vols., under the editorship of Rev. J.\r\nStevenson and George Waring, Esq., M.A. A description is given in Prof.\r\nWestwood's _Palæographia Sacra Pictoria_.\r\n\r\nNine shillings were paid for the carriage of a mummy from London,\r\nprobably one of those which are now in the Ashmolean Museum. It was\r\ngiven by Aaron Goodyear, a Turkey merchant, who gave also a model of the\r\nChurch of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and various little images,\r\nand in 1684 more than forty coins.\r\n\r\n[140] It is strange that no entry of the gift of this priceless volume\r\nis found in the Register of Benefactions, any more than of that of the\r\nVernon MS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1682.\r\n\r\nRichard Davis, M.A., of Sandford, Oxon, gave the portrait of Margaret,\r\nCountess of Richmond, a book of Russian laws, and the Runic Calendar or\r\nClog Almanack, now exhibited in the glass case at the entrance of the\r\nLibrary. The latter is thus described in the Register: 'Calendarium\r\nligneum, tam materia quam usu perpetuum, unius ligni quadrati angulis\r\nincisum, more antiquo.'\r\n\r\nDr. John Morris, Regius Professor of Hebrew, who died in 1648,\r\nbequeathed five pounds annually to the University, to be paid to some\r\nMaster of Arts of Ch. Ch., chosen by the Dean, for a speech 'in Schola\r\nLinguarum,' in honour of Sir Thomas Bodley, 'and as a panegyric and\r\nencouragement of the Hebrew studies,' on Nov. 8, in the presence of the\r\nVisitors of the Library after the conclusion of the annual visitation.\r\nThe bequest was to take effect after the death of his wife, which\r\nhappened on Nov. 11, 1681; and on Oct. 6, 1682, Convocation fixed 3 p.m.\r\nas the hour for delivery of the Speech on the Visitation-day.\r\n\r\nThe Speeches are continued annually, although, probably for want of\r\npublic notice, only scantily attended, none but those actually\r\ninterested in the Visitation of the Library, together with the speaker's\r\nfriends, being generally aware of it. If provision were made for the\r\ndeposit of the Speeches in the Library after delivery, they would no\r\ndoubt form an interesting and accurate record of its growth, and of many\r\npassing events which, for want of such a record, are soon forgotten.\r\nOnly one speech appears to be preserved in the Library: it is that\r\ndelivered on Nov. 8, 1701, by Edmund Smith, M.A., of Ch. Ch., and is\r\nvery beautifully written in imitation of typography. But in this case\r\nnothing is recorded of the history of the preceding year, the speech\r\nbeing simply a panegyric of the Founder. It has been printed among\r\nSmith's _Works_, a pamphlet of 103 pages dignified with that name, of\r\nwhich the third edition appeared at London in 1719[141]. Dr. Rawlinson\r\nappears to have endeavoured to compile a list of the Speakers; for\r\nBishop Tanner, in a letter to him dated Oct. 11, 1735, from Ch. Ch.,\r\nsays he will enquire them out, if he can, but that they are not entered\r\nupon the Chapter books, since they are not appointed by the Chapter, but\r\nprivately by the Dean or Hebrew Professor, and paid by the\r\nVice-Chancellor, in whose accounts alone their names are probably\r\nentered[142].\r\n\r\nThe names of the Speakers up to the year 1690 are given in Wood's\r\n_Athenæ_ (ii. 127) as follows. They were all M.A., and Students of Ch.\r\nCh.:--\r\n\r\n  1682  Thomas Sparke\r\n  1683  Zach. Isham\r\n  1684  Chas. Hickman\r\n  1685  Thos. Newey\r\n  1686  Thos. Burton\r\n  1687  Will.

Aldrich\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1683.\r\n\r\nThree MSS., containing the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Syriac Pentateuch,\r\nand the Syriac Old Testament, were purchased at the cost of the\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1684.\r\n\r\nNine Oriental and Russian MSS. were given by Joseph Taylor, LL.D., of\r\nSt. John's College. And Sir Rob. Viner, Bart., the loyal alderman of\r\nLondon, favoured the Library with a human skeleton, a tanned human skin,\r\nand the dried body of a negro boy!\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1685.\r\n\r\nThomas Marshall, or Mareschall, D.D., Rector of Lincoln College, and\r\nDean of Gloucester, who died April 18, bequeathed his MSS., and all such\r\namong his printed books as were not already in the Library. The MSS.\r\namounted to 159, chiefly Oriental, including some valuable Coptic copies\r\nof the Gospels, &c., which were procured for him by Huntington, with a\r\nfew in Dutch, and others miscellaneous in language and subject. They are\r\nentered in Bernard's Catalogue, pp. 272-3, and 373-4. The printed books\r\nare still kept together under his name.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1686.\r\n\r\nFell, Bishop of Oxford, who died July 10, bequeathed a few MSS. They\r\nconsist of an early and curious collection of _Vitæ Sanctorum_ in four\r\nfolio volumes, of a transcript (in nine folio volumes) of a _Glossarium\r\nSeptentrionale_ by Francis Junius, Dionysius Syrus in Latin by Dudley\r\nLoftus, and two Greek MSS., Damascius and Euthymius Zigabenus, described\r\nat the end (col. 907) of Mr. Coxe's Catalogue of the Greek MSS. One\r\nother MS. has somehow been incorporated in this collection (now numbered\r\n21-23) which does not belong to it. It is a _Clavis Linguæ Sanctæ_, or\r\nexplanation of all the Hebrew, and some Chaldee, roots, found in the Old\r\nTestament, by Nicholas Trott, in three folio volumes, written with great\r\ncare and neatness. This, of which the first part had been printed at\r\nOxford in 1719, was sent to the Library in 1746, as appears from the\r\nfollowing letter, preserved (without address) in a parcel of papers\r\nrelating to the Library, now in the Librarian's study:--\r\n\r\n'MY LORD,\r\n\r\n'My wife's grandfather Judge Trott, cheif justice of South Carolina,\r\ndesired on his death bed that his forty years' labour relating to the\r\nHebrew root might be sent as a present to the Publick Library at Oxford.\r\nI proposed to have carried it, but my time has allways been taken up at\r\na disagreable series of Court Martials, and now I am again going to the\r\nWest Indies. That I must beg your Lordship will order or give it a\r\nconveyance to the University, and I am, with great respect, my Lord,\r\n\r\n                 'Your Lordship's most humble servant,\r\n  '_23 Nov., 1746._                       'THOS. FRANKLAND.'\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, from the accounts, &c., that the MS. was not\r\nactually delivered until 1748 or 1749, when it was received through Dr.\r\nHunt.\r\n\r\nA few of Bishop Fell's MSS. came subsequently to the Library among those\r\nof Rev. Henry Jones[144], who succeeded Fell in his rectory of\r\nSunningwell, Berks, in the church of which parish the Bishop's wife was\r\nburied.\r\n\r\nAt the Visitation on Nov. 8, it was ordered that notice be given that\r\n'Nullus in posterum quemlibet librum aut volumen extra Bibliothecam\r\nasportet,' and that monition be sent to every College and Hall for the\r\nreturn of any books taken out within three days. Several books appear to\r\nhave been reported in previous years as missing; hence, doubtless, the\r\nissue of this order.\r\n\r\n[144] Hearne's pref. to John Ross, p. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1687.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the visit of King James II to Oxford, chiefly, but\r\nunsuccessfully, made for the purpose of overawing the fellows of\r\nMagdalen College, who had refused to elect as president his nominee,\r\nAnth. Farmer, he was invited by the University to partake of a breakfast\r\nor collation in the Library. For this purpose he came hither on the\r\nmorning of Sept. 5, between nine and ten, where, at the south part of\r\nthe Selden end, a banquet was prepared which cost the University £160,\r\nconsisting of 111 dishes of meat, sweetmeats, and fruit. The King sat\r\nhere for about three quarters of an hour, and held some conversation\r\nwith Hyde about a Chinese, 'a little blinking fellow,' who had recently\r\nvisited the place, and about the religion of China; but asked no one to\r\njoin him at the table. Upon rising to depart, a scene of strange\r\nindecorum, as it would now appear, ensued; the 'rabble' (as they are\r\ndescribed) of courtiers and academics rushed upon the mass of untouched\r\ndainties, and began a disorderly scramble, in which they 'flung the wet\r\nsweetmeats on the ladies linnen and petticoats, and stained them.' The\r\nKing watched the scramble for two or three minutes, and then departed,\r\ncommending to the Vice-Chancellor and doctors his chaplain, W. Hall, who\r\nhad preached before him the day previous, and delivering a most fatherly\r\nhomily on the sin of pride, the virtue of charity, and the duty of doing\r\nas they would be done to. Good, gossipping, Ant. à Wood gives in his\r\n_Autobiography_ a full account of all that passed, from which are taken\r\nthe quotations made above[145].\r\n\r\n[145] See also Miss Seward's _Anecdotes_, Supplement, 1797, p. 72.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1688.\r\n\r\nDr. Hyde went up to London in this year to demand personally of the\r\nCompany of Stationers the books which were due to the Library by Act of\r\nParliament (1 James II, cap. 17, for seven years, continuing previous\r\nacts), but which they had neglected to send. His expenses were £6 5_s._\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1690.\r\n\r\nThirty pounds were paid in this year to Antony à Wood for twenty-five\r\nMSS. out of his library[146]. These are volumes of great value,\r\nincluding Chartularies of the Abbeys of Glastonbury and Malmesbury, and\r\nof the Preceptory of Sandford, Oxon, copies of Papal bulls relating to\r\nEngland, a register of lands in Leicestershire _temp._ Hen. VI, &c.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Wood's MSS., and printed books, came to the Library,\r\ntogether with the other collections preserved in the Ashmolean Museum,\r\nin 1860.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Wood in this year estimated the number of MSS. in the\r\nLibrary at 10,141. This must have been the number of separate books, not\r\nvolumes, as in 1697 the latter appear from Bernard's Catalogue to have\r\nbeen about 6700.\r\n\r\n[146] In Bernard's Catalogue the purchase is said to have been made in\r\n1692, but this is an error, as it is entered in the accounts of 1690.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1691.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 8, died Dr. Thomas Barlow, Bishop of Lincoln, who, retaining his\r\nattachment for the place over which he had presided from 1652 to 1660,\r\nbequeathed to it seventy-eight MSS. (now bound in fifty-four volumes),\r\nand all the printed books in his collection which the Library did not\r\npossess, the remainder going to Queen's College. They appear to have\r\nbeen received in the years 1693-4, as large payments for the carriage\r\nare found in the accounts then. His MSS. are described in the old\r\nCatalogue of 1697. The printed books, which are particularly rich in\r\ntracts of the time of Charles I and the Usurpation, are still kept\r\ndistinct, being called _Linc._; ending, in the 8^o series, at about the\r\nmiddle of the shelves marked with the letter C in that division. They\r\nare placed in the gallery on the left hand of the great central\r\nroom[147]. His legacy included a copy of the famous _Exposicio Sancti\r\nJeronimi in Simbolo Apostolorum_, which was printed at Oxford in 1468,\r\nand completed, as the colophon states, on Dec. 17. This volume was given\r\nto Barlow, as he notes at the beginning, by Bishop Juxon, July 31, 1657.\r\nIt is exhibited in the glass case near the entrance. The Library\r\npossesses also seven other productions of the early Oxford press. They\r\nare as follow:--\r\n\r\n    1. _Ægidius Romanus de Peccato Originali_, dated March 14, 1479.\r\n    This was one of Rob. Burton's books. Qu. unique?\r\n\r\n    2. _Textus Ethicorum Aristotelis, per Leonardum Arretinum\r\n    translatus_, 1479. One of Selden's books.\r\n\r\n    3. _Expositio Alexandri [de Ales] super tertium librum [Arist.] De\r\n    Anima_. 'Impressum per me Theodericum rood de Colonia in alma\r\n    universitate Oxon.' Oct. 11, 1481.\r\n\r\n    4. _Joh. Latteburii Exposicio Trenorum Jheremie_, July 31, 1482. No\r\n    place, but printed with the same type as the last.\r\n\r\n    5. _Liber Festivalis_, in English, printed by Rood and Hunt, 1486.\r\n    Two copies, but both very imperfect. The more imperfect one of the\r\n    two formerly belonged to Herbert, and was bought for £6 6_s._ in\r\n    1832; two additional leaves have been inserted by Mr. Coxe, which\r\n    were found among Hearne's scraps, having been given to him as\r\n    fragments of a Caxton by Bagford. The other copy was bought in 1852,\r\n    at Utterson's sale, for £6 10_s._\r\n\r\n    6. _Opus Wilhelmi Lyndewoode super Constitutiones Provinciales_. No\r\n    place or date, but identified by the type.\r\n\r\n    7. _Vulgaria quedam abs Terentio in Anglicam linguam traducta_.\r\n    Without place or date, but also identified by the type. The\r\n    following note, which corroborates the identification, is written in\r\n    red ink on a fly-leaf in the volume (which includes several other\r\n    tracts): '1483. Frater Johannes Grene emit hunc librum Oxon. de\r\n    elemosinis amicorum suorum[148].'\r\n\r\nA list of sixty-six books, which Hunt, the Oxford printer and\r\nbookseller, had in his hands for sale in 1483, is preserved in his own\r\nwriting on a fly-leaf in a copy of a French translation of Livy, Paris,\r\n1486, which was bought for the Library from Mr. C. J. Stewart, in Dec.\r\n1860, for £12. The list is headed thus: 'Inventorium librorum quos ego\r\nThomas Hunt, stacionarius universitatis Oxoniensis, recepi de Magistro\r\nPetro Actore et Johannis (_sic_) de Aquisgrano ad vendendum, cum precio\r\ncujuslibet libri, et promito (_sic_) fideliter restituere libros aut\r\npecunias secundum precium inferius scriptum, prout patebit in\r\nsequentibus, Anno Domini M^o. CCCC^o. octuagesimo tercio.'\r\n\r\n[147] In most of them is inscribed the motto, αιεν αριστευειν.\r\n\r\n[148] This last book is described by Dr. Cotton in the second series of\r\nhis _Typographical Gazetteer_, published in 1866, from a copy in the\r\nUniversity Library at Cambridge. Besides the other Oxford books\r\nenumerated by that learned bibliographer, several fragments of another,\r\na _Compendium totius Grammaticæ_ (conjectured to have been written by\r\nJohn Anwykyll, Waynflete's first Grammar Master at Magdalene College)\r\nhave been discovered. They have been identified by Mr. H. Bradshaw, the\r\nLibrarian of the University of Cambridge, whose extensive acquaintance\r\nwith early typography is well known. That gentleman found, at Cambridge,\r\ntwo leaves in the University Library in 1859, two more in Corpus Christi\r\nin 1861, and two in St. John's in 1866. Four other leaves were\r\ndiscovered by the present writer in 1867, bound up as fly-leaves in a\r\nvolume in the library of Viscount Dillon, at Ditchley, Oxfordshire. Mr.\r\nBradshaw supposes the book to have been printed about 1483-6.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1692.\r\n\r\nThirty-eight Persian and Arabic MSS., with one printed book, were bought\r\nfrom Hyde, the Librarian. They are entered in Bernard's Catalogue, pp.\r\n286-7. Being bought out of the funds of the University, no mention of\r\nthe price paid for them is found in the Library accounts.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1693.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental MSS., in number 420, of the famous Edward Pococke, Regius\r\nProfessor of Hebrew (who had deceased Sept. 10, 1691), were purchased by\r\nthe University for £600. They are chiefly in Armenian, Hebrew, and\r\nArabic, with three volumes in Æthiopic, a Samaritan Pentateuch, and a\r\nPersian Evangeliary. A list is given at pp. 274-278 of Bernard's\r\nCatalogue. In 1822 the Library became possessed of a portion of\r\nPococke's Collection of printed miscellaneous books, by the bequest of\r\nRev. C. Francis, M.A., of Brasenose College. They are chiefly small\r\nvolumes in Latin, on historical subjects; and are, for the most part,\r\nplaced in the shelves marked 8^o Z. Jur. [Arabic version of Isaiah, see\r\np. 81.]\r\n\r\nAnother large Oriental collection was added in this year by the\r\npurchase, from Dr. Robert Huntington, for the sum of £700, of about 600\r\nMSS. These he had procured while holding the post of chaplain to the\r\nEnglish merchants at Aleppo[149]. The collection is one of very great\r\nvalue and rarity. No. 1 is a fine and ponderous Syriac volume,\r\ncontaining the works of Gregory Abulpharage. No. 2 is a very fine folio\r\nArabic MS., written in the year of the Hegira 777 (= A.D. 1375), and\r\ndedicated to the Sultan Almalek Alashraf Shalian ben Hosain; in it, as\r\nUri says in his Catalogue, 'variæ Ægypti regiones recensentur, agrorum\r\ncujusque regionis mensura definitur, et annui redditus exponuntur.'\r\nDibdin[150] describes it in his own exaggerated style, as follows:--'One\r\nof the grandest books-- ... a sort of Domesday compilation--which can\r\npossibly be seen.... The scription is in double columns, with the\r\nmargins emblazoned only in stars. The title, on the reverse of the first\r\nleaf, is highly illuminated, in a fine style; not crowded with\r\nornaments, but grand from its simplicity. At the end, we observe that it\r\nis (rightly) called _Munus Pretiosum_, and that the author was\r\nSherfiddin Iahia ben Almocar ben Algiaian. The inspection of such a\r\nvolume, on the coldest possible morning, even when the thermometer\r\nstands at _zero_, is sufficient to warm the most torpid system.' No. 80\r\nis a copy of Maimonides' _Yad Hachazaka_, revised by the author, with\r\nhis autograph signature at the bottom of fol. 165, and a MS. note by him\r\non fol. 1. Of these an engraved facsimile is given in _Treasures of\r\nOxford, containing Poetical Compositions by the ancient Jewish Authors\r\nin Spain, and compiled from MSS. in the Bodl. Libr. by H. Edelman and\r\nLeop. Dukes; edited and rendered into English by M. H. Bresslau_: part\r\ni. 8^o. Lond. 1851. A second part of this work was to have contained\r\nprose selections from MSS. in the Huntington, Pococke, Michael, and\r\nOppenheim collections, but no more was published. Among Huntington's\r\nbooks there are also three, of no great antiquity, in the Mendean\r\ncharacter, of which Dr. T. Smith narrates in his life of Bernard (1704,\r\np. 21) that two were said to have been given by God to Adam, and the\r\nthird to the angels, 330,000 years before Adam. And one volume (No. 598)\r\nis in the Ouigour language, a Tartar dialect, of which very few\r\nspecimens are known to exist. A gentleman (M. Vaḿbery M.\r\nVaḿbery), the traveller in Tartary, who is engaged in forming a\r\nChrestomathy of this dialect, came in the last year to England for the\r\npurpose of examining this volume, as one of the few on which his work\r\ncould be based. Three MSS. exist at Paris; but that in the Bodleian is\r\nsaid to be the most beautiful of all as a specimen of writing, as well\r\nas the most ancient. It is a version of the _Bakhtiar Nameh_. A\r\ndescription of it, with an engraved facsimile, is given in Davids'\r\n_Turkish Grammar_, 4^o. Lond. 1832, pref. p. xxxi.\r\n\r\nAn exchange of some duplicates was made with the Library of Queen's\r\nCollege, and in 1695 the duplicates of Bishop Barlow's Collection were\r\ntransferred, in accordance with his will, to the same Library.\r\n\r\n[149] He had previously given thirty-five MSS. in the years 1678, 1680,\r\nand 1683. He died on Sept. 2, 1701, only twelve days after his\r\nconsecration as Bishop of Raphoe.\r\n\r\n[150] _Bibliogr. Decam._ iii. 472.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1694.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Clarke was employed in this year in making a catalogue of\r\nPococke's and Huntington's MSS., for which he altogether received\r\nbetween £13 and £14.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1695.\r\n\r\nBooks were bought from Mr. Bobart, and at the auction of the library of\r\nSir Charles Scarborough, M.D.\r\n\r\n_Stationers' Company._ See 1610.\r\n\r\n_MSS. from Wood._ See 1658.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1696.\r\n\r\nFrom this year until 1700, Humphrey Wanley was an assistant in the\r\nLibrary, at an annual salary of £12. He had also £10 at the end of this\r\nyear 'extraordinary, for his paines already past,' and £15, at the\r\nbeginning of 1700, 'for his pains about Dr. Bernard's books.' Possibly\r\nthis grant may have been in consequence of the interposition of Bishop\r\nLloyd of Worcester, who, in a letter to Wanley of Jan. 6, in that year,\r\npromises to speak to the Bishop of Oxford to see whether he can get his\r\nplace in the Library made better for him[151]. Wanley was no favourite\r\nwith Hearne. The following passage from the _MS. Diary_ of the\r\nlatter[152] is a specimen of the censure which he on several occasions\r\npasses on him: 'Humphrey Wanley appears from several passages to be a\r\nvery illiterate silly fellow. He committed strange and almost incredible\r\nblunders when he was employed by Dr. Charlett and some others in\r\nprinting the catalogue of the MSS. of England and Ireland, which work\r\nwas committed first to the care of Dr. Bernard; but he being then very\r\nweak and otherwise employed, he could not take so much pains about it as\r\nhe would, had he not been thus hindered.' The very accurate index,\r\nhowever, to this Catalogue was Bernard's own work, made from the\r\nproof-sheets, and written with his own hand, 'uti ab illo accepi,' says\r\nDr. T. Smith in his Life (1704, p. 48). He prepared also another index,\r\nwhich included besides the contents of eight of the great foreign\r\nlibraries, but not the Royal Library at Paris, the catalogue of which he\r\nwas unable to obtain.\r\n\r\n[151] Walker's _Letters by Eminent Persons_, i. 102. It is pleasant to\r\nfind that Wanley in more prosperous days evinced his gratitude for the\r\nhelp he had received in the Library, by giving, in the year 1721, £7\r\n7_s._, together with a MS. Latin Bible.\r\n\r\n[152] 1714, vol. li. p. 193.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1697.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Edward Bernard, D.D., the Savilian Professor of\r\nAstronomy (which occurred on Jan. 12), the University became the\r\npurchaser from his widow of the greater part of his library. A selection\r\nfrom his printed books, made on behalf of the Library by H. Wanley,\r\ncomprising many rare Aldines and specimens of the 15th century, were\r\nbought for £140, and his MSS., many of which were valuable copies of\r\nclassical authors, together with collated printed texts and his own\r\n_Adversaria_, for £200. Of 218 of the latter, Bernard has given a very\r\nbrief list in his own invaluable _Catalogus Manuscriptorum Angliæ_,\r\nwhich appeared posthumously, in the year of his death. (Vol. ii. pp.\r\n226-8.) The bulk of his books are dispersed through various divisions of\r\nthe Library; but about thirty volumes of his own _Adversaria_ are kept\r\ntogether under his name. A very full account, by H. Wanley, of the\r\npurchase of the collection is printed by Dr. Bliss in his notes to the\r\n_Ath. Oxon._ (iv. 709), who adds that this addition 'contained many of\r\nthe most valuable books, both printed and MSS., now in the Library.'\r\n\r\nIn the discharge of his duty of selection, Wanley came into sharp\r\ncollision with his chief, Dr. Hyde, as is shown by a curious paper, in\r\nWanley's handwriting, which was transcribed by Dr. Rawlinson from the\r\noriginal in Dr. Charlett's possession[153]. The paper gives a list of\r\nbooks for the not securing which, together with others, out of Dr.\r\nBernard's collection, blame had been thrown upon Wanley, and which Hyde\r\nhad said must by all means be bought at the auction which was to be held\r\nin October, 1697. To the title of each book so specified, Wanley appends\r\nsome caustic remarks, exposing Dr. Hyde's little acquaintance with the\r\nLibrary or with the books themselves; and sums up thus at the\r\nclose:--'This is what I have to say to these 13 books, one whereof I\r\nlook upon as imperfect, two more I was charged not to meddle with, and\r\nthe other ten are in the Library already. I shall wave all unmannerly\r\nreflections, as whether this be not in you _insignis insufficientia_,\r\nfor which you are liable to be turned out of your place; or [whether,]\r\nif you had been employed to bring in a list of Dr. Bernard's books\r\nwanting in the Library, and took the same method as now, the University\r\nwould not have bought a fair parcel of duplicates, and such like; but I\r\npass them by. Tho' it must be owned that the University being willing to\r\nlay out but 140 pounds, some different editions of the Bible, Fathers,\r\nClassicks, &c., were preferr'd to some books not at all in the Library,\r\nbut they were at the same time judged to be of less moment, and likely\r\nto be given to it by future benefactors.'\r\n\r\nThe quarrel, however, soon ceased; for, in the following year, Hyde was\r\nanxious to see Wanley appointed as his successor. The latter, in a\r\nletter to Dr. Charlett, dated Oct. 10, 1698[154], repeats a conversation\r\nheld with Hyde on the previous evening, in which the Librarian said\r\n'that he is heartily weary of the place of Library-keeper; that he must\r\nuse more exercise in riding out, &c., if he intends to preserve his\r\nhealth; which will of necessity hinder his attendance there. He had\r\nrather I succeeded him than anybody else, which I cannot do untill I am\r\na graduate; that, if I have any friends amongst the heads of houses,\r\nthey cann't do better for me than in procuring for me the degree of\r\nBatchellor of Law, that I may be in a condition to stand for his place\r\nwith others, which he will resign as soon as I have obtain'd the said\r\ndegree, and (for my sake) will communicate his intentions to nobody else\r\nin the mean time. He presses me to get this degree as soon as possible,\r\nurging that he does not care how soon he is rid of his place.' Wanley\r\nasks for Charlett's advice; what that was does not appear, but, at any\r\nrate, he did not obtain the degree which he desired, and consequently\r\ndid not become eligible as Hyde's successor.\r\n\r\nSixteen MS. treatises on Mathematics, Astronomy, and Ancient History, by\r\nThomas Lydiat, were given by Will. Coward, M.D. They are placed amongst\r\nthe Bodl. MSS., chiefly between Nos. 658-671.\r\n\r\n[153] Rawlinson's copy is now in MS. Rawl. Misc. 937. For the knowledge\r\nof this paper the writer is indebted to Rev. W. H. Bliss.\r\n\r\n[154] Ballard MSS. xiii. 45.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1700.\r\n\r\nConsiderable fears were entertained for the safety of the Divinity\r\nSchool and that portion of the Library which is built over it. About\r\nthirty-two years before, some failure had been observed in the roof of\r\nthe former, which was rectified under the superintendence of Sir\r\nChristopher Wren. When Bishop Barlow's books were brought to the\r\nLibrary, in 1692 or 1693, the galleries on either side of the middle\r\nroom were erected; and, as the beams of the roof of the School were then\r\nobserved to give from the wall, they were anchored on both sides, under\r\nthe direction of Dr. Aldrich. But the tight bracing had now caused the\r\nsouth wall, that which adjoins Exeter College garden, to bulge outwards,\r\nso that the book-stalls were found to have started from the wall by\r\nthree and a-half inches at the top and two and a-half at the bottom; the\r\nwall itself was seven and a-half inches out of the perpendicular, and\r\nthe four great arches of the vault of the School were all cracked.\r\nHereupon Dr. Gregory, the Savilian Professor, was despatched to London\r\nto consult Sir C. Wren again, and, by his advice, additional buttresses\r\nof great depth and strength were erected on the south side, the weight\r\nof the bookstalls was removed from the roof of the School by their being\r\ntrussed up to the walls with iron cramps; and the cracks in the vault\r\nwere filled with lead or oyster-shells, and in some places with the\r\ninsertion of new stones, and were then 'wedged up with well-seasoned\r\noaken wedges.' This work went on through the summers of 1701 and 1702;\r\nand in 1703 some similar repairs were executed in some of the other\r\nSchools. The letters and papers of Wren on the subject, with the\r\ndraughts, and reports of the workmen employed, are preserved in Bodley\r\nMS. 907. They are printed in [Walker's] _Oxoniana_, iii. 16-27.\r\n\r\nIn this year died Henry Jones, M.A., Vicar of Sunningwell, Berks[155].\r\nHe bequeathed to the Library sixty volumes in MS., very miscellaneous in\r\ncharacter, and chiefly of the 16th and 17th centuries. Some of them had\r\nbelonged to Bishop Fell. The bequest probably came to Oxford some few\r\nyears after Mr. Jones' death, as the books are entered (in a full and\r\naccurate list) by Hearne, in the Benefaction Book, among the gifts of\r\nabout the years 1706-12. It was from a modern transcript among these\r\nthat Hearne edited the _Historia Regum Angliæ_ of John Ross or Rouse;\r\nand seventy-one documents from No. 23, which is an Hereford Chartulary,\r\nwere printed by Rawlinson at the end of his _History of Hereford_, 8^o,\r\nLond. 1717. One volume has for many years been missing from the\r\ncollection, viz., a funeral oration, by John Sonibanck, on the death of\r\nQueen Elizabeth of York, in 1503. A list of the MSS. is printed from the\r\nBenefaction Register, in Uffenbach's _Commercium Epistolicum_, pp.\r\n200-208.\r\n\r\nBetween 1700 and 1738 Sir Hans Sloane is recorded to have given\r\nconsiderably more than 1400 volumes, together with his picture in 1731;\r\nbut the majority of them do not appear to have been considered of much\r\nvalue, and only 415 are specified by name in the Benefaction Register.\r\nDr. Hyde, in a letter to Hudson, which accompanied a list of the books\r\nfor which the latter had asked with a view to registration, says he\r\nscarce thinks the entry to be 'for the credit of the business, _nos\r\ninter nos_[156].' But Hudson appears to have thought that the\r\nomission proceeded rather from carelessness, for, in a letter to Wanley,\r\nhe says that he thinks Hyde assigned '_non causa pro causa_[157].'\r\n\r\n[155] Steele's _MSS.

It is here printed from a\r\ncopy sent by Hyde to Wake, then Rector of St. James, Westminster, and\r\npreserved amongst the Wake Correspondence in the library of Ch. Ch.:--\r\n\r\n  'March 10, 1700/01,\r\n  'CHRIST CHURCH, OXON.\r\n\r\n    'SIR,--I being a little indisposed by the gout, acquaint you thus by\r\n    letter, that what I long agoe designed (as you partly knew) I am now\r\n    about to put in execution. That is to say, I shall shortly lay down\r\n    my office of Library-keeper, about a month hence, which resolution I\r\n    do now declare, and I do hereby give you timely and statuteable\r\n    notice of the same as Pro-Vice-Chancellor, entreating that, as the\r\n    Statute requires, you will in two days order Mr. Cowper to draw a\r\n    Programma to be set up at the Schools to the sence of the enclosed\r\n    paper, he best knowing forms and lawyers' Latin.\r\n\r\n    'Among the Bodleian Statutes in the Appendix, in the Statute _de\r\n    causis amovendi aut libere recedendi_, you will find that upon the\r\n    Library-keeper's notice thus given, you are in two days' time to fix\r\n    up the programma preparatory to make it known that about a month\r\n    hence (which is about the end of this term) that office will be\r\n    actually resigned and void.\r\n\r\n    'My reasons for leaving the place are two, viz. one is because (my\r\n    feet being left weak by the gout) I am weary of the toil and\r\n    drudgery of daily attendance all times and weathers; and secondly,\r\n    that I may have my time free to myself to digest and finish my\r\n    papers and collections upon hard places of Scripture, and to fit\r\n    them for the press[158]; seing that Lectures (though we must attend\r\n    upon them) will do but little good, hearers being scarce and\r\n    practicers more scarce.\r\n\r\n    'I should have left the Library more compleat and better furnish'd\r\n    but that the building of the Elaboratory[159] did so exhaust the\r\n    University mony, that no books were bought in severall years after\r\n    it. And at other times when books were sometimes bought, it was (as\r\n    you well know) never left to me to buy them, the Vice-Chancellor not\r\n    allowing me to lay out any University mony. And therefore some have\r\n    blamed me without cause for not getting all sorts of books.\r\n\r\n    'Before the Visitations I did usually spend a month's time in\r\n    preparing a list of good books to offer to the Curators; but I could\r\n    seldom get them bought, being commongly (_sic_) answered in short,\r\n    that they had no mony. Nay, I have been chid and reproved by the\r\n    Vice-Chancellor for offering to put them to so much charge in buying\r\n    books. These things at last discouraged me from medling in it. But,\r\n    however, I leave the Library three times bigger than I found\r\n    it[160], and furnished with a Catalogue of which I found it\r\n    destitute. I wish the University a man who may take as much pains\r\n    and drudgery as I have done whilst I was able to do it.\r\n\r\n    'I entreat you with all speed to cause the Register to put up the\r\n    programma signed with your name, that so things may be regularly and\r\n    statutably dispatched in order, until the time of actuall\r\n    resignation shall come.\r\n\r\n  'In the mean time I remain,\r\n            'Your humble servant,\r\n                      'THOMAS HYDE.'\r\n\r\nJohn Hudson, M.A., of Queen's, afterwards D.D. and Princ. of St. Mary\r\nHall, was elected in Hyde's room; he was opposed by J. Wallis, M.A., of\r\nMagd., the Laudian Professor of Arabic, but was chosen by 194 votes to\r\n173[161]. A letter to him from Hyde on his election, with advice about\r\nthe entering of Sir H. Sloane's books in the Register, the augmentation\r\nof Mr. Crabbe's salary, the Catalogues and the Statutes, is printed in\r\n[Walker's] _Letters by Eminent Persons_, i. 173. He had previously, in\r\n1696-98, given seventy books to the Library, and in 1705-10 he added\r\nnearly 600. Hyde did not long survive his resignation, dying before one\r\nyear had elapsed, on Feb. 18, 1702. He was buried at Handborough, near\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\nIn this year Thomas Hearne, the famous antiquary, was appointed Janitor,\r\nor Assistant, in the Library. He tells us in his _Autobiography_ (p. 10)\r\nthat, from the time of his taking the degree of B.A. in Act term, 1699,\r\n'he constantly went to the Bodleian Library every day, and studied there\r\nas long as the time allowed by the Statutes would admit,' and that the\r\nfact of this his 'diligence being taken notice of by all persons that\r\ncame thither, and his skill in books being likewise well known to those\r\nwith whom he had at any time conversed,' occasioned Hudson's appointing\r\nhim to be an Assistant immediately upon his own election as Librarian.\r\nIt appears, from the Visitors' Book, that a payment of £10 was made to\r\nhim in this year, and that, in the next year, £30 were voted to him for\r\nhis assistance in making an Appendix to the Catalogue of printed\r\nbooks[162], and for enlarging and correcting the Catalogues of MSS. and\r\nCoins. Extra payments of 50_s._ were also made to him in 1704 and 1706,\r\nand of 20_s._ in 1709.\r\n\r\n_The Bodley Speech._ See 1682.\r\n\r\n[158] These were left in MS. at Hyde's death, and have never been\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n[159] _i.e._ the Ashmolean Museum.\r\n\r\n[160] Hyde was greatly mistaken here, as a calculation made by Hearne in\r\n1714 (_q.v._) showed that the Library had then little more than doubled\r\nsince 1620.\r\n\r\n[161] _Reliqq. Hearn._ ii. 616.\r\n\r\n[162] For an account of Hearne's Appendix, see 1738.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1702.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of printed books were given by Steph. Penton,\r\nB.D., and a collection of 500 coins was bequeathed about this time by\r\nTim. Nourse, of Univ. Coll.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1704.\r\n\r\nThe name of John Locke appears in the Register, as the donor of his own\r\nworks (which he gave at Hudson's request), together with some others,\r\nincluding, with an honourable fairness, those of Bishop Stillingfleet\r\nwritten in controversy with himself. As Locke's expulsion from Ch. Ch.,\r\nin 1684, by royal mandate, for political reasons, is sometimes, with an\r\ninjustice which he himself would doubtless have warmly repudiated,\r\nrepresented as if it had been the act of Oxford itself, it is worth\r\nwhile to quote the language in which this gift from him, twenty years\r\nafterwards, is recorded, and recorded, too, by the pen of the earnest\r\nand conscientious Jacobite, Thomas Hearne: 'Joannes Lock, generosus, et\r\nhujus Academiæ olim alumnus, præter Opera ab ipso edita, ob ingenii\r\nelegantiam, doctrinæ varietatem, et philosophicam subtilitatem, omnibus\r\nsuspicienda (_here follow the titles of his own works_), insuper ex suo\r\nin optimas artes amore, animoque ad supellectilem literariam augendam\r\npropenso, Bibliothecæ huic dono dedit libros sequentes;' _scil._\r\nChurchill's _Voyages and Travels_, 4 vols., 1704, Stillingfleet's\r\n_Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity_, Stillingfleet's _Answer to\r\nLocke_, and Rob. Boyle's _History of the Air_. Locke desired, in a\r\ncodicil to his will, that in compliance with a second request from\r\nHudson, all his anonymous works should also be sent to the Library[163].\r\n\r\nWilliam Ray, formerly consul at Smyrna, presented about 600 coins,\r\nchiefly Greek, which E. Lhwyd (who reported their number to be about\r\n2000) said he had been told had been collected at Smyrna by his\r\ncook[164]. But the Benefaction Register records that they were obtained\r\nby Ray from the widow of one 'domini Dan. Patridge,' who had himself\r\nintended to present them to the University. They were put in order, and\r\na Catalogue made of them, some years afterwards, by Hearne, who intended\r\nto have given the Catalogue to the Library, 'had not,' he says, 'the ill\r\nusage he afterwards met with there obliged him to alter his mind[165].'\r\nRay also gave a Turkish almanac.\r\n\r\n[163] Lord King's _Life of Locke_, edit. 1830, vol. ii. p. 51.\r\n\r\n[164] Walker's _Letters by Eminent Persons_, i. 137.\r\n\r\n[165] _Life_, p. 13, in _Lives of Leland, Hearne, and Wood_, 1772.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1706.\r\n\r\nThe supposed original MS. of _The Causes of the Decay of Christian\r\nPiety_, by the author of _The Whole Duty of Man_, was given by Mr.\r\nKeble, the London bookseller. It is now numbered Bodl. MS. 21. Dr.\r\nAldrich was of opinion that it is not in the author's own hand, but\r\ncopied in a disguised hand by Bishop Fell. Hearne thought it to be in a\r\ndisguised hand of Sancroft's; but the resemblance is very slight\r\nindeed[166].\r\n\r\n[166] See _Letters by Eminent Persons_, vol. ii. pp. 133-4.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1707.\r\n\r\nSix volumes of Archbishop Usher's _Collectanea_, with two or three other\r\nMSS. which had belonged to him, were given to the Library by James\r\nTyrrell, the historian, who was the archbishop's grandson. He had placed\r\nthem previously in the hands of Dr. Mill, for use by him in his edition\r\nof the Greek Test., and it was about a week before Mill's death, June\r\n21, 1707, that they were transferred, together with a gift from Mill of\r\nvarious printed books, to the Library[167]. They are now placed among\r\nthe Rawlinson Miscellaneous MSS., 1065-1074, and one volume containing\r\nvarious readings in the Gr. Test., is numbered Auct. T. v. 30. Other\r\nvolumes of his MSS. Collections in the Library are Barlow, 10 and 13; _e\r\nMusæo_, 46 and 47; Rawl. Misc. 225, 280; Rawl. Letters, 89, and\r\nRawlinson C. 849, 850, which last were given to Hearne by Tyrrell.\r\nHearne has printed some extracts at the end of _Gul. Neubrig._ iii. 804.\r\nSix Samaritan and other MSS. which belonged to Usher are now in the\r\nclass called _Bodl.

These last, amounting to\r\ntwenty-three volumes, are now numbered Bodl. Addit. 1. D. 1-4, 2. B.\r\n1-16, 2. C. 1-3.\r\n\r\nThomas, Archbishop of Gocthan, in Armenia, visited England on an errand\r\nwhich seems to have justly excited great sympathy and attention.\r\nSensible of the low condition of his fellow-countrymen, through their\r\nwant of means of instruction, and being earnestly anxious to do\r\nsomething towards their elevation, he had spent some forty years in\r\ntravels through Europe and Asia for the purpose of procuring books,\r\nestablishing printing-presses, educating young men, and obtaining help\r\nfor the furtherance of his Christian and patriotic projects. His first\r\nprinting establishment, at Marseilles, was ruined by the mismanagement\r\nand fraud of those to whom it was entrusted. He then, for ten years,\r\ncarried on a press at Amsterdam, where he printed, in Armenian, the New\r\nTestament, the Prayers and Hymns of the Church, a translation of Thomas\r\nà Kempis, and several other theological works, together with some in\r\ngeography, history, and science. But troubles and trials again overtook\r\nhim; disputes and law-suits involved him in debt; one hundred books,\r\nwhich he shipped for Armenia in 1698, were taken at sea, and so never\r\nreached their destination. And so, poor and sorrowful, in extreme old\r\nage, the Archbishop came to England to seek for help, recommended by Dr.\r\nJohn Cockburn, the English Minister at Amsterdam. He was well received\r\nby the Archbishops, and Sharp, of York, procured him an interview with\r\nthe Queen, who gave him some assistance. Then, recommended by Bishop\r\nCompton[168], of London, he came to Oxford. What he received in the way\r\nof the help which he most of all needed, deponent sayeth not; let us\r\nhope it was not small. What he received in the way of honour, and what\r\nhe did to cause the introduction of his name in these _Annals_, Hearne\r\ntells, in his own interesting way, in his _Diary_[169]:--\r\n\r\n    'May 24. Last night came to Oxon one of the Armenian Patriarchs. He\r\n    is Patriarch of the Holy Cross in Gogthan (near Mount Ararat) in\r\n    Greater Armenia. He subscribes himself in his speech to the Queen in\r\n    the last month, by translation, Thomas. The next day he was attended\r\n    to the publick Library by Dr. Charlett, Pro-Vice-Chancellor. At the\r\n    entrance, Dr. Hudson, the Keeper, made him a handsome complement in\r\n    Latin; but the Patriarch, being about 90 years of age, and\r\n    understanding no Latin, nor Greek, nor any European language but\r\n    Italian, took but little notice of any thing. He afterwards was\r\n    carried to Dr. Charlett's lodgings, where he was treated.\r\n\r\n    'May 29. This day was a Convocation in the Theatre, when the\r\n    Archbishop of the Holy Cross in Gocthan was created Doctor of\r\n    Divinity, and his nephew, Luke Nurigian, and Mr. Cockburn, son of\r\n    Dr. Cockburn, were created Masters of Arts. The day before, the\r\n    Archbishop presented to the publick Library several books in\r\n    Armenian which he has caused to be printed. Mr. Wyatt, the orator,\r\n    spoke a speech in his commendation, and presented him, the Queen\r\n    having been pleased to let us be without a Professor. During the\r\n    Convocation, several papers printed at the Theatre were given to the\r\n    Doctors, Noblemen, and some others, entitled, _Reverendissimi in\r\n    Christo Patris Thomæ, Archiepiscopi Sanctæ Crucis in Gocthan\r\n    Perso-Armeniæ, peregrinationis suæ in Europam, pietatis et literarum\r\n    promovendarum caussa susceptæ, brevis narratio; una cum dicti\r\n    Archiepiscopi ad serenissimam Magnæ Britanniæ Reginam oratiuncula\r\n    ejusque responso. Accedunt de eodem Archiepiscopo testimonia ampla\r\n    et præclara._ Printed upon two sheets, folio[170].'\r\n\r\nIn another volume of memoranda[171], Hearne adds the following notice of\r\none of the books given by the Archbishop: 'Amongst other books which he\r\ngave to the Bodleian Library is a History, at the beginning of which the\r\nArchbishop's nephew put the following memorandums: \"_Historia Nationis\r\nArmeniæ, a Moise Chorenensi grammatico, doctore Armeno_.

IV. c. 110.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1710.\r\n\r\nDr. Richard Middleton Massey, formerly of Brasenose College, gave (with\r\na few other books) a very curious and valuable series of Registers of\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee for augmentation of poor vicarages, from\r\n1645 to 1652, in eight folio volumes, with one earlier volume containing\r\na list of livings in the diocese of Norwich, with their values and\r\nincumbents. To local antiquaries these proceedings are full of interest,\r\nwhile their historical and biographical value is equally great. They are\r\nnow numbered Bodl. MSS. 322-330. Of the printed books given by Dr.\r\nMassey, most of those in octavo were placed at the end of Bishop\r\nBarlow's books, in the shelves marked _D. Linc._\r\n\r\nThree thousand pounds were offered by the University for the library of\r\nIsaac Vossius, but refused.

He was buried on Monday night following (between 7 and 8\r\no'cl.) in Haly-well Churchyard, very privately. Upon his coffin was\r\nput, _I. C. ag. 38. 1712_; but I heard him say some time since he was 39\r\nyears old[173].' He is described in the following caustic terms by Zach.\r\nConr. Uffenbach, in a letter written in 1713, and printed in his\r\n_Commercium Epistolicum_[174]:--\r\n\r\n    'Alteri [præfecto Bibliothecæ], nomine Crab, caput vacuum cerebro\r\n    est, lepidum alias, dignusque homo quem ridiculo illo encomio, quo\r\n    tamen multi serio egregios viros onerarunt, ornetur, vociteturque\r\n    Helluo, non librorum tamen sed præmiorum, quæ ab exteris\r\n    Bibliothecam hanc invisentibus avide excipit, statimque cauponibus\r\n    reddit pro liquore, ad guttur colluendum purgandumque a pulvisculo,\r\n    qui librorum tractationem velut umbra aut nebula comitari solet.\r\n    Quamvis non ejus, sed tertii infimique Bibliothecarii, hoc sit\r\n    muneris, ut libros in loculos reponat, quævis in ordinem redigat\r\n    atque emundet.'\r\n\r\nThe date of Crabb's appointment has not been ascertained, but it must\r\nhave been previous to 1699, as on Nov. 8 of that year an order appears\r\nin the Visitors' Book for an extra payment to him of £10[175]; other\r\nadditional payments of £5 and 50_s._ are made to him annually until\r\n1710. Two vols. of an index to texts of printed sermons, ending about\r\nthe year 1708, (now Bodl. MSS. 47 and 657,) which were, doubtless,\r\nintended to form a continuation of Verneuil's little book, are said in\r\nan old entry in the Catalogue to be by 'Mr. Crabb.' The following brief\r\naccount of him is given in Rawlinson's MSS. collections for a\r\ncontinuation of Wood's _Athenæ_:--\r\n\r\n    'Joseph Crabb, son of Will. Crabb, clerk, born at Child-Ockford in\r\n    Dorsetshire on ---- 1674; educated in grammar learning at ----;\r\n    matriculated as a member of Exeter College, 18 July 1691; took the\r\n    degree of B.A. 17 Oct. 1695; became Sub-librarian at the public\r\n    library; removed to Gloucester Hall, where he became M.A., 4 July\r\n    1705, and died ----.'\r\n\r\nRawlinson goes on to attribute to him (as his solitary claim to a place\r\nin the _Athenæ_) a _Poem on the late Storm_, Lond. 1704, fol., but this\r\nwas written (as well as a Latin poem _In Georgium reducem_, Lond. 1719,\r\nfol.) by John Crabb, Fellow of Exeter College (B.A., Oct. 15, 1685;\r\nM.A., June 19, 1688), who was also a Sub-librarian at an earlier period,\r\nbut the date of whose entrance into office as well as of quittance is\r\nnot known. The latter became Rector of Breamore, Hants, in 1709, where\r\nhe died in 1748 at the age of eighty-five. He is remarkable for having\r\nmarried four wives, all of whom lie buried with him in his church. The\r\nthird of these, Grace Shuckbridge, became his wife when he was aged\r\nseventy-six and she was forty-nine; the last (who survived until March\r\n13, 1777) was thirty-six when she took him, at the age of eighty-one,\r\nfor better or worse. There is a handsome marble tablet to his memory on\r\nthe north wall of the Chancel of Breamore Church, bearing the following\r\ninscription, and surmounted by his arms (_scil._, on a field gules a\r\nchevron between two fleur-de-lis above and a crab displayed below or;\r\ncrest, a demi-lion rampant or) painted in their proper colours:--\r\n\r\n    'H.

By this\r\narrangement Hearne retained the keys, so that he could go in and out\r\nwhen he pleased[178].\r\n\r\n'Sept. 16, Dr. Hudson told me to-day that some have complain'd that\r\nbooks in the Publick Library are not so easily come at as usual. I am\r\nglad there is such a complaint.

At his fourth wedding\r\nthat prelate had the good taste and feeling to present his friends with\r\nmemorial rings inscribed with the couplet:--\r\n\r\n    'If I survive\r\n    I'll make them five.'\r\n\r\nBut the lady did not afford him the wished-for opportunity.\r\n\r\n[177] Hearne's _MS.

Diary_, xxxix. 120.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1713.\r\n\r\nThe learned and munificent Narcissus Marsh, Archbishop successively of\r\nCashel, Dublin, and Armagh, on his death, Nov. 2, in this year,\r\nbequeathed to the Library a very large and valuable gathering of\r\nOriental MSS., which had been chiefly procured for him in the East by\r\nHuntington, and at the sale of Golius' library, at Leyden, in October,\r\n1696, by Bernard. The collection numbers at present 714 volumes, but\r\nprobably some of these may have been books added for convenience' sake\r\nfrom other sources. Many of them bear the motto of some former owner\r\n(_qu._ Golius?), somewhat like in form to Selden's, but better in\r\nspirit, 'πανταχη την αληθειαν.' It is strange that no notice of\r\nthis liberal gift is found in any of the Library Registers, and it is\r\nonly from a passing mention in Hearne's preface to Camden's _Elizabeth_\r\n(p. lxvi.) that we find it was a death-bed legacy, and consequently\r\nlearn the date of its acquisition. Hearne there says that the books were\r\nplaced in the Library 'in tenebris;' and this expression was made one of\r\nthe subjects of complaint against him when prosecuted in 1718 in the\r\nVice-Chancellor's court on account of that preface. He then replied that\r\nthe expression was correct, for that they were placed in a dark corner\r\nto which access was only had through a trap-door, but that he himself\r\nhad put them there for want of a better place. He had wished to deposit\r\nthem in one of the rooms in the Picture Gallery, but Dr. Hudson kept\r\nthat for his own purposes[180].\r\n\r\nAt this period every stranger admitted to read in the Library had to pay\r\nnine shillings in fees, of which 1_s._ went to the Head Librarian, 3_s._\r\n6_d._ to the Second Librarian, 1_s._ 6_d._ to the Janitor, 2_s._ to the\r\nRegistrar (for an order for admission, but in the Long Vacation this fee\r\nwent to the Second Librarian), and 1_s._ to the Proctor's man[181]. In\r\n1720 the fee to be received from every visitor not qualified to read was\r\nfixed at one penny, to be paid to a porter who was then first appointed\r\nto the charge of the Picture Gallery. It subsequently rose by a silent\r\ncustom to the large sum of a shilling; but some few years ago the\r\nCurators fixed the charge to visitors at threepence each, unless\r\naccompanied, and in consequence _franked_, by some member of the\r\nUniversity in his academic dress. Since this moderate sum has been\r\nfixed, the number of ordinary sight-seeing visitors has, naturally, much\r\nincreased[182].\r\n\r\nThe suppression, by an order of the Heads of Houses, dated March 23,\r\n1712/3, of Hearne's edition of Dodwell's tract _De Parma Equestri\r\nWoodwardiana_, was attributed by Hearne himself to (as the remote\r\noccasion) an incident connected with his office in the Library, which is\r\nrelated very fully by himself in vol. xliv. of his _MS. Diary_. On Feb.\r\n20, Mr. Keil, the Savilian Professor of Geometry, brought to the Library\r\nan Irish gentleman named Mollineux, recommended by Sir Andrew Fountaine,\r\nto whom he requested Hearne to show the curiosities of the place. As\r\nKeil was 'a very honest gentleman,' Hearne little suspected that his\r\nfriend was possessed with the 'republican ill principles' and 'malignant\r\ntemper' of Whiggism, and consequently was not very guarded in his talk.\r\nAfter showing him various MSS. and coins, he took the visitor into the\r\nAnatomy School[183], where all kinds of odds and ends were preserved;\r\namongst which was (as Hearne gravely notes in another place) a calf\r\nwhich, being born in the year of the Union, 1707, had (it is to be\r\npresumed in consequence thereof) two bodies and one head. What followed\r\nduring the exhibition of this museum is worth relating in the diarist's\r\nown words:--\r\n\r\n    'I mentioned a picture engraved and hanging there with horns and\r\n    wings, and underneath, _uxor ejus ad vivum pinxil_. This picture\r\n    many had said was Benjamin Hoadley, the seditious divine of London;\r\n    but, for my part, I gave no other description of it than this, that\r\n    'twas the picture of one of the greatest Presbyterian, republican,\r\n    antimonarchical, Whiggish, fanatical preachers living in England.\r\n    And this description was enough to exasperate him. And yet, for all\r\n    that, he did not discover any passion, nor give the least hint that\r\n    he was a Whig himself. Neither did he give any hint of it afterwards\r\n    till I came to mention a tobacco stopper tipped with silver, and\r\n    given to me by a reverend divine, who had informed me that it was\r\n    made out of an oak that lately grew in St. James's Park, but was\r\n    destroyed by the D. of M. for the great house he was building near\r\n    St. James's, and that the said oak came from an acorn that was\r\n    planted there by King Charles II, being one of those acorns that he\r\n    had gathered in the Royal Oak, where he was forced to shelter\r\n    himself from the fury of the rebells after the fight at Worcester.\r\n    Mr. Mollineux was at the other end of the room when this was shew'd,\r\n    and the said story told; but hearing it he comes immediately to the\r\n    tables, and expresses himself in words of this kind, viz. _that\r\n    'twas a bawble, and that an hundred such things were not worth the\r\n    seeing_. Mr. Keil however thought otherwise, and said that he\r\n    thought my collection was better than that in the Laboratory. Some\r\n    mirth passing after this, I went on with my description, and had not\r\n    yet formed an opinion that Mr. Mollineux was a Whig; but finding\r\n    that he was still inquisitive after other curiosities, and that he\r\n    pretended to much skill in good ingraving and drawing, I produced\r\n    the picture of a beautifull young man, over the head of which was\r\n    ΕΙΚΩΝ ΒΑΣΙΛΙΚΗ, and underneath, _Quid quæritis ultra?_ I did not\r\n    tell them whose picture it was, but said that I shew'd it them as a\r\n    thing excellently well done, which they all allow'd and view'd it\r\n    over and over, and seemed to be mightily taken with it, and Mr.\r\n    Mollineux in particular was pleased to say that 'twas admirably well\r\n    done, and deserved a place amongst the most exquisite performances\r\n    of this kind, at the same time asking how long I had had it, and\r\n    whose picture I took it to be. To the former of which questions I\r\n    reply'd, about a quarter of a year, to the latter that I did not\r\n    pretend to tell who it was designed for. Yet Mr. Keil was pleased to\r\n    laugh, and to tell Mr. Mollineux, _They are all rebells, Mr.\r\n    Mollineux, they are all rebells in this place_, speaking these words\r\n    in a merry joking way, and not with any intent to do me an injury.\r\n    Mr. Mollineux took the words upon the picture down, which I did not\r\n    deny him, not thinking that 'twas with a design to inform against\r\n    me, as it afterwards proved. Yet from this time I began a little to\r\n    suspect his integrity, and that he was not one of those good men I\r\n    expected from Mr. Keil, whom I had always found to be a man of\r\n    honesty.'\r\n\r\n_Hinc illæ lachrymæ!_ Poor Hearne was reported to Dr. Charlett the same\r\nafternoon for showing the Pretender's Picture; a meeting of the Curators\r\nof the Library was threatened; but eventually the matter seemed to pass\r\nover by his being desired by the Vice-Chancellor to give up the key of\r\nthe Anatomy School, in order that the determining Bachelors might meet\r\nthere, by which change Hearne was mulcted of the fees which he obtained\r\nfor showing the room, and was sometimes detained one hour, or two, later\r\nthan usual in order to see to the locking up of the staircase on which\r\nit is situated. On March 23, however, he was summoned before the Heads\r\nof Houses for remarks made in his preface to Dodwell's above-mentioned\r\ntract, and, after a sharp discussion, in which reference was made to his\r\nexhibition of the portraits, he was ordered to suppress his preface, and\r\nre-issue the book without it; to which he consented. He was pressed to\r\nmake a formal retractation of the passages to which objection was made,\r\nbut this he stiffly refused to do. He says in a letter to Sir Philip\r\nSydenham that the only form of retractation or expression of sorrow he\r\ncould have been prevailed on to sign (strongly resembling the famous\r\napology of a middy to an insulted naval surgeon) would have been some\r\nsuch form as this:--'I, Thomas Hearne, A.M., of the University of\r\nOxford, having ever since my matriculation followed my studies with as\r\nmuch application as I have been capable of, and having published several\r\nbooks for the honour and credit of learning, and particularly for the\r\nreputation of the foresaid University, am very sorry that by my\r\ndeclining to say anything but what I knew to be true in any of my\r\nwritings, and especially in the last book I published, intituled,\r\n_Henrici Dodwelli de Parma Equestri Woodwardiana Dissertatio, &c_, I\r\nshould incurr the displeasure of any of the Heads of Houses, and as a\r\ntoken of my sorrow for their being offended at truth, I subscribe my\r\nname to this paper, and permitt them to make what use of it they\r\nplease[184].'\r\n\r\n[180] Hearne's _MS. Diary_, vol. lxxi. May 20.\r\n\r\n[181] _Ibid._ vol. xlvii. p. 89.\r\n\r\n[182] In an account of a visit to Oxford by an American tourist, which\r\nappeared very recently in the _New York Times_, and was copied into\r\nEnglish journals, written with the warm-hearted tone of one who could\r\nrightly appreciate the interest of the place, although (like most\r\nTransatlantic visitors) he spent but twenty-four hours in it, the\r\nfollowing comment is made upon the smallness of this Bodleian fee:--'The\r\ngentleman [_i.e._ the present Janitor, Mr. John Norris] who showed me\r\nthrough this noble collection, and gave me the most interesting\r\nexplanations, politely informed me that the charge was 3_d._ It went\r\nagainst my conscience to give a gentleman of his civility and erudition\r\nthe price of a pot of beer, and I added a small testimonial, for which\r\nhe seemed more than sufficiently grateful.'\r\n\r\n[183] This was the room which is now attached to the Library under the\r\nname of the _Auctarium_.\r\n\r\n[184] Hearne's _MS. Diary_, xlviii. 22. The retractation and apology\r\nwhich Hearne afterwards actually submitted to the Vice-Chancellor in\r\ncourt in 1718, when in trouble again for his preface to Camden's\r\nElizabeth, was very similar in style to this. But he was not allowed to\r\nread it. _Ibid._ lxxi. 3 May.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1714.\r\n\r\nAn evidence of the increased intercourse which sprang up between Denmark\r\nand England, in consequence of the marriage of Queen Anne, is probably\r\nto be found in the number of Danish readers who frequented the Library\r\nin the interval between her marriage and her death. Between the years\r\n1683 and 1714, forty-nine Danes are entered in the _Liber Admissorum_,\r\nbesides many from Sweden, Norway, and the North of Germany. The total\r\nnumber of foreigners admitted within the same period was no less than\r\n244.\r\n\r\n'In the year 1714 were in the Bodleian Library:--\r\n\r\n          30169 pr. vols.\r\n          05916 MSS. vols.\r\n          -----\r\n  In all  36085.'\r\n\r\n  (Hearne's _MS. Diary_, vol. xci. p. 256.)\r\n\r\nIt is strange that, notwithstanding Selden's and Laud's large additions,\r\nthe Library had therefore very little more than doubled since 1620.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded in vol. li. of the same Diary (p. 187) that the old\r\nseries of portraits which were painted on the wall of the Picture\r\nGallery was renewed in November of this year. These portraits, amounting\r\nin number to about 222, ran round the gallery, immediately under the\r\nroof; many of them were fancy-heads of ancient philosophers and writers,\r\nbut besides these there were some real portraits of English writers and\r\ndivines, up to the time of James I. A list of the whole series, as well\r\nas of the oil paintings in the Gallery, was printed by Hearne together\r\nwith his _Letter containing an Account of some Antiquities between\r\nWindsor and Oxford_. Of the renovation of the wall-paintings he thus\r\nspeaks in his preface to _Rossi Historia Regum Angliæ_ (1716): 'Non\r\npossim quin bibliothecæ Bodleianæ Curatores laudem, qui pictori\r\nAcademico [_i.e._ Wildgoose] in mandatis dederunt, ut veteres effigies\r\nrenovet nitorique pristino restituat: quippe quas eo pluris æstimendas\r\nesse censeo, quod eas in galeria depingendas jusserit ipse Bodleius,\r\nLoci Genius.' When the Gallery was re-roofed in 1831, all these\r\npaintings were, however, removed [_see_ p. 15].\r\n\r\nAbout the end of this year the Arundel Marbles, which, strange to say,\r\nhad been exposed to the open air within the quadrangle of the Schools\r\never since they were given to the University, were removed into one of\r\nthe rooms on the ground-floor, where they still remain. It was said that\r\nthey had suffered more 'since they were exposed to our air, than they\r\ndid in many hundred years before they came into it[185].' But the\r\ninfluence of the air was not all they had to contend against, for Hearne\r\ntells us that the defacing of the Marble Chronicle (of which there are\r\nportions that were read by Selden, which now can no longer be read at\r\nall) and some others, was owing not merely to exposure to the weather,\r\nbut 'to the abuses of children who are continually playing in the area,\r\nand of other ignorant persons[186].'\r\n\r\n[185] _Letters by Eminent Persons_, 1813, vol. i. p. 297.\r\n\r\n[186] _Letters by Eminent Persons_, 1813, vol. i. p. 204.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1715.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Hearne's MS. Diary [vol. liii.] that differences between\r\nhim and Dr. Hudson (of which he makes frequent mention) increased during\r\nthis year. He was reported to the Vice-Chancellor in April for absence\r\nfrom the Library through his duties as Bedel, by reason of which readers\r\nhad difficulty in obtaining books lodged above stairs. To this complaint\r\nhis reply was that he was not bound, as Second Librarian, exclusively to\r\ndo such 'drudgery,' but that Dr. Hudson was himself obliged by statute\r\nto deliver out such books as were under lock-and-key, and books in\r\nquarto and octavo, either personally or by his own special deputy. At\r\nthe same time a complaint was made against him by three Bachelors of\r\nArts of Queen's College, for refusing books to them which were out of\r\nthe faculty of Arts prescribed to them by the statutes of the Library.\r\nHearne's only reply to the Vice-Chancellor in this case was the asking\r\nwhether they had, also in accordance with the Statutes, come to the\r\nLibrary in their hoods, if under two years' standing; at which 'he\r\nsmiled.' It appears, therefore, that this requirement had already become\r\nobsolete. Dr. Hudson, however, regarded the matter more seriously, and\r\nthreatened that Hearne should be turned out of both his places.\r\n\r\n    April 15. (Good Friday!) 'This morning Dr. Hudson went out of town,\r\n    and that pert jackanapes Bowles (who is Dr. Hudson's servitor) came\r\n    to tell me that he is gone, and that the sweeper of the Library\r\n    being dead, I must not admitt any one to sweep the Library as\r\n    formerly. I returned answer I had nothing to do in that case. In the\r\n    afternoon I was at study in the Library, and Bowles brings up a\r\n    woman and girl, and set them to sweeping, and left them there, tho'\r\n    this should not have been, they being not sworn nor admitted as\r\n    sweepers. Indeed all things are now done very irregularly in the\r\n    Library by the permission of Dr. Hudson, and by the impudence of\r\n    this pert, silly servitour, and I am afraid much mischief is done\r\n    withall. The whole Library and galleries and studies and the Anatomy\r\n    School used to be swept this day; they began about eight, and had\r\n    not done till four or five in the afternoon. But now the Library\r\n    only below stairs was swept over, and that very slightly, and all\r\n    things were left in a bad condition, to my very great concern[187].'\r\n\r\nAt the visitation on Nov. 8, the Curators passed a resolution that the\r\nplaces of Under-librarian and Bedel were inconsistent, and that on S.\r\nThomas' day Hudson should be at liberty to appoint some other person to\r\nHearne's office. Hereupon Hearne immediately, without a moment's delay,\r\nresigned both the offices of Architypographus and Superior Bedel of\r\nCivil Law, and claimed to remain in the Library; but Hudson had fresh\r\nlocks put on the doors, of which Bowles kept the keys, so that Hearne\r\nwas unable to go in and out as before. However, he continued to execute\r\nhis office whenever the Library was open until Jan. 23, 1716, when the\r\nAct which imposed a fine of £500, with other penalties, upon any one who\r\nheld any public office without having taken the Oaths, came into\r\noperation. Then at once, all worldly interests, all affection for the\r\nold place of his studies and his care, gave way to the honest and\r\nunwavering dictates of his conscience; the Non-juror withdrew, and, with\r\nsingularly hard measure, in spite of his representations, his place was\r\nordered by the Curators to be filled up at Lady-Day, not on the ground\r\nof his own retirement, but on that of _neglect of duty_! His successor\r\nwas Rev. John Fletcher, M.A., Chaplain, and afterwards Fellow, of\r\nQueen's College. Hearne states that his salary was, with great\r\nunfairness, withheld from him for the whole half-year preceding\r\nLady-Day, together with some fees which were due[188]. But to the end of\r\nhis life he maintained that he was still, _de jure_, Sub-librarian, and,\r\nwith a quaint pertinacity, regularly at the end of each term and\r\nhalf-year, up to March 30, 1735[189], continued to set down, in one of\r\nthe volumes of his Diary, that no fees had been paid him, and that his\r\nhalf-year's salary was due.\r\n\r\nOn Hearne's announcing John Ross's _Historia Angliæ_ for publication in\r\nthis year, W. Whiston forwarded to him a MS. of a Latin historical poem\r\nentitled _Britannica_, written in 1606 by an author of the same names as\r\nthe forth-coming historian, with the following note inserted:--\r\n\r\n    'This book was written, as I think, by my great uncle, Mr. John\r\n    Rosse, rector of Norton-juxta-Twycross in Leicestershire, where I\r\n    was myself born. If it may be of any use to Mr. Hern at Oxford in\r\n    his intended edition of this or some other work of the same author\r\n    now advertis'd, or may be thought worthy of a place in the publick\r\n    library of that University, it is hereby freely given thereto by\r\n\r\n                                        'WILLIAM WHISTON.\r\n  '_London, December 12, 1715._'\r\n\r\nHearne adds that (of course) the author was altogether different from\r\nthe Ross of his editing, and that the poem had been printed at Frankfort\r\nin 1607, as he learned from a MS. Catalogue of Mr. Richard Smith's books\r\nlent him by Bp. Fleetwood of Ely[190]. The MS. is now numbered, Bodley\r\n573.\r\n\r\nA learned tailor of Norwich was in this year recommended by Dr. Tanner,\r\nthen Chancellor of Norwich Cathedral, for the Janitor's place in the\r\nLibrary should it be vacant. Although but a journeyman tailor of thirty\r\nyears of age, who had been taught nothing but English in his childhood,\r\nHenry Wild had contrived within seven years to master seven languages,\r\nLatin, Greek, Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic and Persian, to which\r\nTanner adds, in another letter to Dr. Rawlinson, Samaritan and Ethiopic.\r\nThe application appears to have been unsuccessful so far as the holding\r\noffice in the Library was concerned; but Wild found some employment in\r\nthe Library for a time in the translating and copying Oriental MSS[191].\r\nHe removed to London about 1720, and died in the following year, as we\r\nlearn from an entry in Hearne's _MS. Diary_, (xcii. 128-9,) under date\r\nof Oct. 29, 1721, where we read:--\r\n\r\n    'About a fortnight since died in London Mr. Henry Wild, commonly\r\n    called, the _Arabick Taylour_. I have more than once mentioned him\r\n    formerly. He was by profession a taylour of Norwich, and was a\r\n    married man. But having a strange inclination to languages, by a\r\n    prodigious industry he obtain'd a very considerable knowledge in\r\n    many, without any help or assistance from others. He understood\r\n    Arabick perfectly well, and transcrib'd, very fairly, much from\r\n    Bodley, being patroniz'd by that most eminent physician, Dr. Rich.\r\n    Mead. He died of a feaver, aged about 39. He was about a\r\n    considerable work, viz. a history of the old Arabian physicians,\r\n    from an Arabick MS. in Bodley. The MS. was wholly transcrib'd by him\r\n    a year agoe, but what progress he had made for the press I know\r\n    not.'\r\n\r\nFive MSS., including the Leiger Book of Malmesbury Abbey, together with\r\na large number of printed books, were given on May 7, by William\r\nBrewster, M.D. of Hereford, a well-known antiquary[192].\r\n\r\nA thick quarto volume (1052 pages) containing a Latin treatise by Adam\r\nZernichaus on the controversy between the Eastern and Western Churches,\r\nconcerning the Procession of the Holy Ghost, was forwarded to the\r\nLibrary through Sir Robert Sutton, ambassador at Constantinople, by\r\nChrysanthus, Patriarch of Jerusalem, nephew and successor of Dositheus,\r\nan autograph Greek epistle from whom, occupying seven pages, is\r\nprefixed. At the end is a list of eleven German scribes who were\r\nemployed upon the transcription of the volume, with the payments they\r\nseverally received. It appears from the Benefaction Register that the\r\nvolume was not actually received at the Library until 1722; and in 1731,\r\nan entry in the catalogue records that the MS. 'was restored to Sir\r\nRobert Sutton, by order of the Vice-Chancellor;' but no reason or\r\nexplanation is given. For more than a century the Patriarch's gift was\r\nconsequently lost from the place of its destination; but in Dec. 1864,\r\nhaving turned up for sale among the well-known stores of Mr. C.

Wheatly's, printed in\r\n_Letters by Eminent Persons_, ii. 116, that the learned commentator\r\nSamuel Parker, son of the Bishop of Oxford, was also at some time\r\nemployed in the Library; for Wheatly expresses a wish that S. Parker's\r\nson, then (1739) an apprentice to Mr. Clements the bookseller, might, if\r\nthe accounts of his extraordinary proficiency be true, be placed 'in his\r\nfather's seat, the Bodleian Library.' As Parker was a non-juror, his\r\nemployment must doubtless have been at some earlier period than this,\r\nbut his name is not met with in any of the old Account-books or\r\nRegisters. One Thomas Parker occurs in the Library accounts in 1766 and\r\nin 1772.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1719.\r\n\r\nDr. Hudson died, on Nov. 27, of dropsy. And at one o'clock on the\r\nafternoon of the very next day, Joseph Bowles, M.A., of Oriel College,\r\nwas elected in his room.\r\n\r\nThe bitter terms in which Hearne frequently, in the course of his\r\n_Diary_, condemns Hudson's management, or rather mismanagement, of the\r\nLibrary, may be supposed to be owing in a considerable degree to\r\npersonal pique and quarrel[194]. But they meet with very singular and\r\nabundant confirmation in the letter of Z. C. Uffenbach, quoted above (p.\r\n130), when the writer expresses, in the following strong language, his\r\nopinion of Hudson's neglect and incapacity, and of the general condition\r\nof the Library under his management:--\r\n\r\n    'Perpende, quæso, mecum, vir eruditissime, quantus thesaurus ex\r\n    solius Bodleianæ Bibliothecæ codicibus elici possit, nisi\r\n    Proto-Bibliothecarii Hudson negligentia ac pertinacia obstaret. Is\r\n    enim muneri abunde satisfecisse, imo eximie ornasse Spartam videri\r\n    vult, dum tot annis unico scriptori, Thucydidem ejus puto, omni\r\n    Bibliothecæ cura plane abjecta, insudavit, cum hoc, quod supra dixi,\r\n    potius agendum fuisset. Nefandam hujus insignis Bibliothecæ sortem\r\n    (ignosce justæ indignationi) satis deplorare nequeo. Inculta plane\r\n    jacet, nemo ferme tanto thesauro uti, frui, gestit. Singulis sane\r\n    diebus per trium mensium spatium illam frequentavi, sed, ita me dii\r\n    ament, nunquam tot una vice homines in illa vidi quot numero sunt\r\n    Musæ, vel saltem artes liberales. De librorum studiosis loquor; nam\r\n    puerorum, muliercularum, rusticorum, hinc inde cursitantium,\r\n    voluminumque multitudinem per transennas spectantium mirantiumque,\r\n    cœtum excipio.... De Proto-bibliothecarii incuria jam dixi,\r\n    ejusque stupendam in historia literaria librariaque, inprimis extra\r\n    Insulam ultraque maria, ignorantiam taceo.'\r\n\r\nOf Hearne, however, Uffenbach writes in the following different\r\nstrain:--\r\n\r\n    'Hîc scholaris, ut hîc loqui amant, esse solet, atque etiamnum est,\r\n    nomine Hearne, qui, præ reliquis, diligentiam suam non modo\r\n    scriptis, sed in novo etiam Bibliothecæ catalogo confitiendo, typis\r\n    proxime exscribendo, probavit; ast, quod dolendum, ad exemplum\r\n    prioris, qui satis jejunus, inconcinnus, erroribusque innumeris\r\n    scatens est.'\r\n\r\nHudson's successor, Bowles, had previously been his Assistant for some\r\nyears, and as, while Hearne was Under-keeper, he had come into sharp\r\ncollision with that irascible antiquary (see under 1715), his election\r\nnow was a matter of sore annoyance to the latter. Hearne dwells upon it\r\nin his _Diary_ with great bitterness and at great length: 'Competitors\r\nwere Mr. Hall, of Queen's, and that pert conceited coxcomb Mr. Bowles\r\n(who is not yet Regent Master) of Oriel College. Bowles carried it by a\r\ngreat majority, having about 160 votes, and Mr. Hall about 77. I think\r\nit the most scandalous election that I have yet heard of in Oxford.' Of\r\nhis supporters he speaks thus:--'Charlett and such rogues, who contrived\r\nto bring in that most compleat coxcomb Bowles to be Head-Librarian, to\r\nthe immortal scandal of all that were concern'd in it[195].' And even,\r\nwhen ten years later he records Bowles' death, he indulges, in\r\nforgetfulness of charity to the departed, in the following strain: 'Of\r\nthis gentleman (a most vile, wicked wretch) frequent mention hath been\r\nmade in these Memoirs. He took the degree of M.A. Oct. 12, 1719. 'Tis\r\nincredible what damage he did to the Bodl. Library, by putting it into\r\ndisorder and confusion, which before, by the great pains I had taken in\r\nit (&c.), was the best regulated library in the world[196].' Bowles'\r\nname never occurs in the _Diary_ without some opprobrious epithet being\r\nattached to it, which may be accounted for partly from his having taken\r\nthe oaths of allegiance after declaring he would never do it (a\r\ndefection which Hearne never forgave in any one), but chiefly also from\r\nhis having personally excluded Hearne from the Library, when the latter\r\nrefused to resign his keys in 1715, by procuring new locks and keys,\r\nwhich he kept in his own custody.\r\n\r\nThree or four days after Bowles' election, Mr. Fletcher, the\r\nSub-librarian (disliking, no doubt, the appointment of his junior over\r\nhis head), resigned his office, to which Bowles appointed the well-known\r\nantiquary, Francis Wise. Upon this appointment Hearne comments thus:\r\n'Bowles put in Mr. Wise, A.M., of Trin. Coll. (a pretender to\r\nantiquities), tho' he had promised it to one of Oriel Coll., that came\r\nin fellow of Oriel when he did, and was very serviceable to him in\r\ngetting the Head Librarian's place; for which Bowles is strangely\r\nscouted and despis'd at Oriel, as a breaker of his word, and a\r\nwhiffling, silly, unfaithfull, coxcomb.' It must be allowed that the\r\nportrait of Bowles in the Library bears out in some degree Hearne's last\r\nepithet, by giving him the appearance rather of a fine clerical\r\ngentleman than of a student.\r\n\r\nBaskett, the printer, presented to the Library a magnificent copy on\r\nvellum of the 'Vinegar' Bible, printed by him in 1717. Only three copies\r\nwere so struck off; the second was placed in the King's Library, and the\r\nthird was sold to the Duke of Chandos, for five hundred guineas, at\r\nwhose sale, in 1747, Lord Foley purchased it for £72 9_s._\r\n\r\n[194] In one passage, Hearne says that such was Hudson's self-esteem\r\nthat he reckoned himself equal to Erasmus or Sir Thomas More, while all\r\nthat was curious in his books was gained from Hearne himself or others.\r\n(_MS. Diary_, vol. lviii. p. 158.)\r\n\r\n[195] Vol. lxxxiv. pp. 59, 60.\r\n\r\n[196] Vol. cxxii. p. 158.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1720.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, one John Hawkins, a highwayman (who was executed in\r\nMay, 1722), is said by an accomplice, Ralph Wilson, who published an\r\naccount of his robberies, to have defaced some pictures in the Library.\r\nThe University is said to have offered £100 for discovery, and a poor\r\nWhig tailor was taken up on suspicion, and narrowly escaped a whipping.\r\nNo particulars, however, of Hawkins' act are given in the pamphlet, and\r\nno further notice of it has been found elsewhere.\r\n\r\nJoseph Swallow, B.A., who died in this year, is found from the Accounts\r\nto have been employed, for some short time, in the Library.\r\n\r\nIn this year the titles of all books which were bought out of the\r\nLibrary funds begin to be recorded, together with their prices; they are\r\nentered in a Register marked with the letter C.\r\n\r\n_Visitors' Fees._ See 1713.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1721.\r\n\r\nThe inscription on the Schools' Tower, beneath the statue of James I,\r\nwas renewed in this year[197].\r\n\r\nSir Godfrey Kneller presented his own portrait to the Gallery.\r\n\r\n[197] Hearne's _Diary_, xci. 196.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1722.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Prince is recorded to have presented heads of our Blessed LORD\r\nand of King Charles I, painted by herself. They appear to be the two\r\npaintings on copper, now hanging in the Sub-librarian's study, called\r\n_Mus. Bibl. II._ Beneath that of our LORD is the following inscription:\r\n'This present figure is the symylytude of our Lorde Jesus our Saviour,\r\nimprinted in amyrald by the Predecessors of the Great Turke, & sent to\r\nPope Innocent y^e Eight at the cost of the Great Turke for a token, for\r\nthis caus, to redeme his brother that was taken prisner.' The\r\ninscription is, of course, if the painting be Mrs. Prince's work,\r\nreproduced _literatim_ from some older copy.\r\n\r\nThe attachment to the old Stuart family, which was so warmly cherished\r\nin Oxford, appears to have lingered in the Bodleian, notwithstanding\r\nHearne's departure, who himself would scarcely have thought that a\r\nvestige of it had been left behind. For in the Benefaction Register for\r\nthis year, the gift of a portrait of Sheffield, Duke of Buckingham, from\r\nhis widow Catherine, a natural daughter of James II, is entered as\r\ncoming from 'filia Regis Jacobi II, του μακαριτου.'\r\n\r\n_Chrysanthus, Patriarch of Jerusalem._ See 1715.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1723.\r\n\r\nThe noble brass statue of William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, (who was\r\nChancellor of the University from 1617 to his death in 1630, and was the\r\ndonor of the Barocci MSS.,) which forms such a conspicuous feature in\r\nthe Picture Gallery, was presented this year by the earl's great nephew,\r\nThomas, the seventh Earl of Pembroke. It was cast by the famous artist\r\nHubert le Sœur, from a picture by Rubens, and is said to weigh about\r\n1600 lbs. The letter of thanks from the University was read in\r\nConvocation on April 19; it is criticized by Hearne in his _Diary_[198]\r\nin the following terms: 'I am told that this letter is very silly and\r\npoor, and that, among other things, his Lordship is told in it that the\r\nstatue is placed _in æde immortalitatis_. Now what this _ædes\r\nimmortalitatis_, church, temple or chappel of immortality is, I cannot\r\nconceive, but am sure that the statue is at present fix'd in the Picture\r\nGallery, adjoyning to the Bodl. Library.'\r\n\r\n[198] Vol. xcvi. p. 101.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1724.\r\n\r\nThe MSS. _Adversaria_ of Dr. J. E. Grabe came to the Library in this\r\nyear after the death of Bishop Smalridge (Sept. 27, 1719), in accordance\r\nwith the will of their writer, who at his death (Nov. 12, 1712)\r\nbequeathed them first to Hickes and next to Smalridge, with the final\r\nreversion to the Bodleian. They form forty-three volumes. Some account\r\nof them is given in Hickes' _Discourse_ prefixed to Grabe's _Defects and\r\nOmissions in Whiston's Collection of Testimonies, &c._ (8^o. Lond.\r\n1712), and they are fully catalogued by Mr. Coxe in vol. i. of the\r\ngeneral Catalogue of MSS., cols. 851-876. In a written list of them,\r\npreserved in the Library, Dr. Bandinel has noted that several volumes of\r\nthe series were purloined before they came to Oxford, while remaining in\r\nthe possession of a friend after Grabe's death.\r\n\r\nA Zend MS. very well and clearly written (dated in the year 1005 of the\r\nera of Yezdegird, _i.e._ A.D. 1635), of the _Leges Sacræ, Ritus, &c.\r\nZoroastris_, was received from G. Bowcher, a merchant in the East\r\nIndies. It was given in 1718, but not forwarded until 1723, when it was\r\nbrought from India by Rev. Rich. Cobbe, M.A. It is now numbered Bodl.\r\nOr. 321. And a Coptic Lexicon, compiled and prepared for the press by\r\nRev. Thos. Edward, M.A., a former Chaplain of Ch. Ch., was bought for\r\nthe sum of ten guineas, which was specially granted from the University\r\nChest. It is now numbered Bodl. Orient. 344. The author was originally\r\nof St. John's College, Cambridge, and tells us in his preface that\r\nBishop Fell, who was also Dean of Ch. Ch., meeting him there in the\r\nhouse of Dr. Edmund Castell, with whom he was living, brought him to\r\nOxford by appointing him a Chaplain of the Cathedral, with the view of\r\ncarrying on the study of the Coptic language, which had fallen to the\r\nground upon the death of Dr. Marshal of Lincoln College. But just when\r\nEdward was prepared to begin printing the results of his labours, his\r\npatron, the Bishop, died; and, as he found no one else cared for the\r\nsubject, he took the College living of Badby in Northamptonshire, and\r\nquitted Oxford. He finally became Rector of Aldwinkle in the same\r\ncounty, and died there in the year 1721. His book is dated 1711. It is\r\ncited by Archdeacon Tattam in his _Lexicon Ægyptiaco-Latinum_. Another\r\nMS. Coptic Lexicon, in two volumes, was purchased in 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1726.\r\n\r\nA large collection (in twenty-five volumes) of the tracts on the Roman\r\nCatholic Controversy which appeared between 1680-1690, was given by\r\nWill. Smith, M.A., of Univ. Coll., and Rector of Melsonby, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1727.\r\n\r\nThomas Perrott, D.C.L., of St. John's College, gave nine volumes of\r\nMSS., the most important of which is a copy-book of the letters written\r\nby Sir John Perrott, Lord Deputy of Ireland, in 1584-6. Another is a\r\nbook of orders from the Privy Council to the officers of the Customs at\r\nLondon, 1604-18: a third, notes of a sermon preached by Usher at the\r\nTemple, July 2, 1620. A few political and miscellaneous tracts, _tempp.\r\nEliz.--Jac. I_, and two heraldic MSS., complete the number. The MSS. are\r\nnoticed in the return printed in the Record Commission Report for 1800,\r\np. 348.\r\n\r\nSome Greek MSS. were bought which had been brought from Mount Athos;\r\nthree of them are now placed amongst the Cromwell MSS., Nos. 15, 16, and\r\n27, and three others are numbered Miscell. Gr. 137-9.\r\n\r\n_Sale of Duplicates._ See 1745.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1729.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowles, the Librarian, died at Shaftesbury, the place of his birth,\r\nand was buried there on Nov. 25. On Dec. 2, Mr. Robert Fysher, B.M.,\r\nFellow of Oriel College, was elected his successor by 100 votes to 85\r\nover Francis Wise, the Under-librarian. Mr. John Bilstone, M.A.,\r\nChaplain of All Souls' and Janitor of the Library, was also a candidate,\r\nbut retired before the election, in the hope of securing Wise's return.\r\nAs Wise held Hearne's old place, and was regarded by him as an usurper,\r\nand as Bilstone held in his possession the new keys which Bowles\r\noriginally procured to render Hearne's old ones useless, the latter\r\nconsequently regarded them both with great disfavour, and rejoiced\r\ngreatly at the result of the election. His account of it is printed in\r\nthe _Reliqq. Hearn._ vol. ii. p. 712.\r\n\r\nForty-two MS. volumes came to the Library by the bequest of the widow of\r\nMr. Francis Cherry, of Shottesbrooke, Berks, the early patron and\r\nconstant friend of Hearne[199]. Cherry himself died Sept. 23, 1713, and\r\nHearne says that he had intended to give his MSS. to his old _protégée_.\r\nThey are not, for the most part, of very great value, but among them are\r\nvarious volumes by Dodwell; and a book written and bound by Q. Eliz. is\r\ndescribed above, under the year 1628. Hearne was greatly annoyed at a\r\npaper of his own, containing reasons for taking the oath of allegiance,\r\nwhich he had written in 1700, coming into the Library amongst these\r\nbooks; he endeavoured in vain (although now in these days his legal\r\nright would be at once recognized) to recover it, and it was published,\r\nto his still greater annoyance, by the Whigs, under the editorship of\r\nMr. Bilstone, the janitor. An account of Hearne's endeavours to regain\r\nit, together with a notice of Mrs. Cherry's bequest and of the MSS., is\r\nto be found in Dr. Bliss' Appendix to his _Reliqq. Hearn._ ii. 899-906.\r\n\r\nIn the Register of Readers admitted by favour occurs, under date of\r\nApril 19, the name of 'C. Wesley, Ædis Xti alumn.,' written in a neat\r\nand clear hand. The name of his great brother is not found in any\r\nregister extending over the period of his stay in Oxford. At this time\r\nthe Library appears to have been almost entirely forsaken. Between\r\n1730-1740 it rarely happens that above one or two books are registered\r\nto readers in a day, while often for whole days together not a single\r\nentry occurs; and since, in the register for this period, the books are\r\nnoted down by three hands, it can hardly be possible that the blanks are\r\ndue to the negligence of librarians (as might have been supposed were\r\nthe same handwriting found throughout) rather than to the lack of\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n[199] In the Benefaction Register they are erroneously entered as coming\r\nby the bequest of Mr. Cherry himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1735.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Hearne (June 10, 1735) fifteen of the MSS. of Thomas\r\nSmith, D.D., of Magdalen College, the well-known and learned non-juror,\r\ncame to the Library, Smith having bequeathed them to Hearne on this\r\ncondition. With them came also copies of Camden's _Britannia_ and\r\n_Annales Eliz._, with MSS. notes by their author. The rest of Smith's\r\nMSS. appear to have come to the Library together with the mass of\r\nHearne's collections, included in Rawlinson's bequest in 1755. They\r\namount altogether to 138 thin volumes, containing notes, extracts and\r\nletters on all kinds of subjects. There is a very full _written_\r\ncatalogue of their contents, in two volumes. Three Greek MSS. were given\r\nby Smith himself on his return from his travels in the East about 1681.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1736.\r\n\r\nThe Library was enriched with the collections of the well-known\r\nantiquary, Thomas Tanner, Bishop of St. Asaph, who died on Dec. 14, in\r\nthe preceding year. By his will, dated Nov. 22, 1733, he bequeathed his\r\nMSS. to the Library together with such printed books, not already there,\r\nas the Curators and Library-keeper should think fit to accept. But he\r\ndirected his executor to burn all his sermon-notes, 'and other little\r\npieces and attempts in divinity,' as well as all his own private papers\r\nand letters. The largest portion of his MSS. (nearly 300 volumes out of\r\n467) consists of the papers which he himself says he 'bought of\r\nArchbishop Sancroft's executors,' but which it is said in the _Gent.\r\nMag._ for 1782 (cited by Gough in his _British Topography_, i. 126) he\r\nbought for eighty guineas of the bookseller Bateman, to whom Sancroft's\r\nexecutors had sold them[200]. Together with these, and perhaps not now\r\nto be distinguished, are some of the collections of Dr. Nalson between\r\n1640 and 1660. To the latter a claim was made through Archdeacon Knight,\r\nin 1737, by Dr. Williams of St. John's College, as grandson of Nalson;\r\nbut the Bishop's brother replied (as we learn from a copy of his answer\r\nand of another letter written by him in 1753) that the Bishop had\r\nbought them at Ely, where they had lain neglected for many years, and he\r\nthought possibly from some one living in the house which Nalson\r\ninhabited when Prebendary of Ely. The matter ended by Dr. Williams\r\nwaiving any claim which he had, in consideration of the place of deposit\r\nbeing the Bodleian[201]. Sancroft's and Nalson's papers together\r\ncomprise a large series of letters of the time of the Civil War, of the\r\nhighest interest and value, from most of the leading personages on both\r\nsides, including Charles I, Rupert, the Protector Oliver, and Hampden.\r\nThere are also collections relating to various dioceses, with very much\r\nthat illustrates both the ecclesiastical and literary history of the\r\nseventeenth century[202]. A selection from the Civil War letters was\r\npublished, in 2 vols. in 1842, by Rev. Henry Cary, M.A. (a son of the\r\ntranslator of Dante, and at that time an assistant in the Library),\r\nunder the title of _Memorials of the Civil War_; but the transcripts\r\nwere very carelessly made, and scarcely a single letter can be trusted\r\nas faithfully and _verbatim_ representing the original. Another volume\r\nof selections from Sancroft's papers was published, with much better\r\ncare, by Will. Nelson Clarke, D.C.L., 8^o, Edinb. 1848, entitled, _A\r\nCollection of Letters addressed by Prelates and Individuals of high rank\r\nin Scotland, and by two Bishops of Sodor and Man, to Archbishop\r\nSancroft, in the reigns of Charles II and James VII_[203]. A catalogue\r\nof the MSS., compiled by the Rev. Alfred Hackman, M.A. (now\r\nSub-librarian) was published in 1860, in a thick quarto volume, forming\r\nvol. iv. of the general Catalogue of MSS. The several volumes are\r\ndescribed in brief in the body of the work; but a very full Index is\r\nsubjoined, in which the contents of all the letters and papers are\r\nentered in detail. The printed books (upwards of 900) contain many, by\r\nthe Reformers and their opponents, which are of the utmost rarity in\r\nearly English black-letter divinity. One of these is an unique copy (as\r\nit is believed) of an edition, printed without place or date, of the\r\n_Pore Helpe_, of which there is also an unique copy of another edition,\r\nequally without place or date, among the Douce books. It has not\r\nhitherto been remarked that two copies, or two editions, exist of this\r\nmetrical satire. Another volume, which contains several tracts printed\r\nby W. de Worde and Gerard Leeu, has also two by Caxton, hitherto\r\nunnoticed as exhibiting his type, and described in the Catalogue simply\r\nas being books without place or date. The merit of their discovery as\r\nCaxton's is due to the recent research of Mr. Bradshaw, the Librarian of\r\nthe Cambridge Library. The one is a clean and perfect copy of the\r\n_Governayle of Helthe_, with the verses called _Medicina Stomachi_, of\r\nwhich the only copy known to Mr. Blades is in the library of the Earl of\r\nDysart at Ham House; the other a wholly unknown quarto edition, in the\r\nsame type, of the _Ars Moriendi_.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when Tanner was removing his books from Norwich to\r\nOxford, in Dec. 1731, by some accident in their transit (which was made\r\nby river) they fell into the water, and were submerged for twenty\r\nhours[204]. The effects of this soaking are only too evident upon very\r\nmany of them[205]. The whole of the printed books were uniformly bound\r\nin dark green calf, apparently about fifty years ago; the binder's work\r\nwas well done, but unhappily all the fly-leaves, many of which would\r\ndoubtless have afforded something of interest, with regard to the books\r\nand their former possessors, were removed. Many of Tanner's own letters\r\nare to be found amongst the Ballard and Hearne MSS., as well as\r\nscattered here and there in other collections; and one volume of them\r\nwas purchased in 1859. Some coins were given by him in 1733. We learn\r\nfrom the Accounts that Thomas Toynbee, an undergraduate of Balliol\r\nCollege (B.A. 1743, M.A. 1745), received £12 12_s._, in 1741, for making\r\na list of Tanner's MSS., and that E. Rowe Mores, the subsequently\r\nwell-known antiquary, arranged some of his deeds in 1753-4.\r\n\r\n[200] Eighteen other volumes of Sancroft's MSS. are to be found in the\r\nHarleian Collection, Brit. Mus., and a few among Wharton's books at\r\nLambeth.\r\n\r\n[201] Thirty-one other volumes of Nalson's papers were offered for sale\r\nto Dr. Rawlinson in 1751 (Letter to H. Owen, Rawl. MS. C. 989. fol.\r\n121). Four volumes which belonged to Bp. Moore's library were restored\r\nto Cambridge out of Tanner's collection in 1741; two of them were\r\nregisters of the Abbeys of St. Edmund's-bury and Langley.\r\n\r\n[202] Some collections for Wiltshire made by Tanner did not come to\r\nOxford with his library, but were forwarded by his son in 1751.\r\n\r\n[203] Dr. Clarke appears not to have been aware of the existence of an\r\ninteresting volume of letters from Scottish Bishops to Bishop Compton of\r\nLondon, among Rawlinson's MSS. (C. 985), which was rescued by Rawlinson,\r\nwith the rest of Compton's papers, from being destroyed as waste paper.\r\nOther letters, including a large number from Archbishop Burnett of\r\nGlasgow, addressed to Archbishop Sheldon, are in a volume of the Sheldon\r\npapers.\r\n\r\n[204] _Gent. Magaz._ 1732, p. 583.\r\n\r\n[205] None of them, however, are now in the state described in a note in\r\n_Letters by Eminent Persons_, ii. 89, where it is said that many 'have\r\nreceived so much injury as to be altogether useless, crumbling into\r\npieces on the slightest touch.' Perhaps the unique copy of _The Children\r\nof the Chapel Stript and Whipt_ which Warton says was amongst Tanner's\r\nbooks, but which has never appeared in any Bodleian Catalogue, may have\r\nperished from this cause. For a notice of the disappearance of two of\r\nChurchyard's tracts, see under the year 1659, p. 81.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1738.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Catalogue of the printed books appeared this year in two\r\nvolumes, folio, of 611 and 714 pp. respectively. It is still a Catalogue\r\nof great use and value, from its remarkable accuracy, and from the\r\nabundance and minuteness of its cross-references. The secret history of\r\nthis Catalogue, however, as of the preceding one, is related by Hearne.\r\nBy him, as he himself frequently tells us[206], the greater portion of\r\nit was virtually prepared soon after his appointment as Sub-librarian,\r\nin 1712 (although no mention of his name is made in Fysher's preface),\r\nand to him, therefore, its accuracy is most probably in a great measure\r\ndue[207]. He compared every book in the Library with Hyde's Catalogue,\r\nand corrected many mistakes, adding notes here and there about anonymous\r\nand synonymous authors, and, as the Vice-Chancellor (Dr. Maunder, of\r\nBalliol) was anxious to have an Appendix issued, he transcribed for this\r\npurpose all his corrections and additions into two folio volumes,\r\n'which' (to take up now Hearne's own account in his _Diary_, vol. lxii.\r\np. 58, under date 1717) 'now lye and are to be seen in the Library....\r\nBut at last Dr. Hudson thought it more convenient with respect to\r\nhimself that both Dr. Hyde's Catalogue and my Appendix should come out\r\ntogether as one intire work, so that he might have the honour of all.\r\nUpon which he employed one Moses Williams, his servitour[208] (the Dr.\r\nbeing then Fellow of University College), to transcribe it, the said\r\nWilliams being in the Dr.'s debt. When Williams had done, he demanded\r\nthe remaining part of his money, which was about ten or twelve pounds,\r\nthe rest having been stopped by the Dr. for the debt just now mentioned.\r\nThe whole was fifty lbs. which he bargained for with the Dr. But when\r\nWilliams desired the said ten or twelve pounds, of which he had\r\nimmediate occasion to discharge the fees and charges for the degree of\r\nBachelor of Arts, the Dr. was in a very great passion, and refused to\r\npay it. Upon which Williams moved the matter so far that the Catalogue\r\nwas laid before the Delegates of the Press, and the Dr. was called\r\nbefore them to his very great mortification, and they told him that\r\n'twas highly unreasonable to stop the poor lad's money. Upon which the\r\nDr. in a great rage and fury paid him; otherwise Williams had most\r\ncertainly put him into the Court. This Catalogue was last summer ordered\r\nto be printed, and the Dr. was refunded his money; but 'tis not yet put\r\nto the press, the Dr. being unwilling it should be printed till such\r\ntime as he hath done Josephus.' But Hudson died before his Josephus was\r\nfinished, and the proposed new Catalogue was consequently begun, and\r\nonly begun, by his successor, Bowles. The latter printed as far as p.\r\n244 of vol. i. and p. 292 of vol. ii. His successor, Fysher, upon his\r\nappointment, engaged the assistance of his friend, Emmanuel Langford,\r\nM.A., Vice-Principal of Hart Hall, who completed the second volume,\r\nwhile Fysher himself finished the first. At the end of the second volume\r\nappeared an announcement of a supplemental Catalogue, as being ready for\r\nthe press, containing the books existing in College Libraries but\r\nwanting in the Bodleian. This, however, never appeared, and nothing is\r\nknown of the MS. from which it was to have been printed. Fysher's\r\nCatalogue appears, from the University Accounts, to have occupied from\r\n1735 in preparation, for which, and for transcribing it for the press,\r\n£194 5_s._ were paid to him.\r\n\r\nAlexander Pope gave, together with copies of his _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_,\r\na curious volume, containing a series of 178 Portraits of East Indian\r\nRajahs and Great Moguls, down to Aurung-Zebe. It is now numbered Bodl.\r\nMS. Sansk. 14.\r\n\r\nThe names of various persons (all, probably, undergraduates) employed in\r\nthe Library about this time are learned from the Accounts:--1738, Mr.\r\nHall; 1740-1, Mr. Allen; 1740, Mr. Toynbee (Ball. Coll., B.A., 1743);\r\n1743, Mr. Jessett (All Souls', B.A., 1745); 1747, Mr. Thomas Winbolt\r\n(All Souls', B.A. 1748).\r\n\r\n[206] Pref. to _Chron. de Dunstaple_, p. xii. _Autobiogr._ p. 11, &c.\r\n\r\n[207] It is fair to say that Fysher remarks in his preface that\r\nexperience proved how entirely vain and foolish were the reports which\r\nhad been spread abroad of the little or the nothing which, after the\r\nlabours of their predecessors, would remain for the then editors to do.\r\n\r\n[208] Moses Williams took his degree as B.A. in 1708. One John Williams\r\n(probably the one of that name who is entered in the Register of\r\nGraduates as having taken the degree of B.A. at Oriel in 1704) appears\r\nto have been a colleague of Hearne's in employment in the Library, about\r\n1704. For in a letter written to Hearne, March 20, 1705/6, one year and\r\na-half after he had quitted Oxford, in which he mentions his having been\r\nappointed to the Head-mastership of Ruthin School in November, 1705, he\r\nrefers to 'our dear friends that are in irons at the Bodleian Library,\r\nthere being several, I suppose, that have been manacled in that pleasing\r\nprison since my being there.' (_Rawlinson Letters_, vol. xii. f. 1.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1739.\r\n\r\nNotification was given to the Vice-Chancellor, on June 9, that thirteen\r\npictures (of no great value) were bequeathed to the Gallery by Dr. King,\r\nMaster of the Charter House, by his will dated July 28, 1736, together\r\nwith £200 for the cleansing and repairing the frames of the pictures\r\nalready in the Gallery. A list of these thirteen is given in Gutch's\r\ntransl. of _Wood's Annals_, vol. ii. pp. 969, 970. The pictures\r\nthemselves are now in the Randolph Gallery. Dr. King also left a legacy\r\nof £400 to the University to prepare a complete and handsome edition of\r\nZoroaster's Works, in Persian, with a Latin translation and notes; but\r\nthis portion of his bequest was not accepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1740.\r\n\r\nA copy of the Byzantine historian, Pachymeres, was restored in this\r\nyear, by order of the Curators, to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, from\r\nwhich it had by some means been removed; but the College paid £4 4_s._\r\nfor its restoration.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1745.\r\n\r\nIn this year died Nathaniel Crynes, M.A., Fellow of St. John's College\r\nand Superior Bedel of Arts, to which latter office he had been elected\r\nJan. 26, 1715/16[209]. He bequeathed to the Library all such books out\r\nof his own valuable collection as it did not already possess, the rest\r\ngoing to his own College. His books in octavo and smaller sizes, with a\r\nfew quartos, are still kept distinct, under his own name, and number 968\r\nvolumes, many of which are of great rarity. Seven MSS. were presented\r\nby him in 1736. In 1727 he purchased some duplicates from the Library,\r\nfor £3 16_s._ 8_d._, and a story, told by Warton in connection with this\r\npurchase, of his fortunately rejecting books which bore the name of\r\nMilton, will be found under the year 1620. There is a biographical\r\nnotice of him in J. Haslewood's Introduction to Juliana Barnes' _Boke of\r\nSt. Alban's_, Lond. 1810, pp. 86-7. In the Accounts for 1746 occur\r\nspecial payments to Fr. Wise, and to one Mr. Gerard Bodley, for\r\ncataloguing and arranging Crynes' books.\r\n\r\n[209] He left a benefaction to his successor in this office, which now\r\nproduces £13 6_s._ 8_d._ yearly.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1746.\r\n\r\nTrott's _Clavis Linguæ Sanctæ_. See 1686.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1747.\r\n\r\nDr. Fysher, the Librarian, died on Nov. 4, at Mr. Warneford's, of\r\nSevenhampton, Wilts, and was buried, on Nov. 7, in Adam de Brome's\r\nchapel in St. Mary's Church, Oxford. And on Nov. 10, Rev. Humphrey Owen,\r\nB.D., Fellow of Jesus College (afterwards D.D., and chosen Principal of\r\nhis College in 1763), was unanimously elected his successor[210].\r\nRawlinson mentions, in a letter to Owen of April 15, 1751, that he had\r\nheard a complaint that in Fysher's time 'there was a great neglect in\r\nthe entry of books into the Benefactors' Catalogue, and into the\r\ninterleaved one of the Library; as to these objections, my answers were\r\nas ready as true, at least I hope so, that Dr. Fysher's indisposition\r\ndisabled him much from the duty of his office, and that I did not think\r\nevery small benefaction ought to load the velom register[211].'\r\n\r\n[210] Memorandum by Owen himself, in reply to a question from Rawlinson,\r\nRawl. MS. C. 989, f. 142. This volume contains a collection of letters\r\nto Owen, chiefly from Browne Willis and Rawlinson, between the years\r\n1748-1756. It affords proof that Owen was what his correspondents would\r\ncall an 'honest' man, _i.e._ a Jacobite. In one letter, Willis sends him\r\na Latin inscription in praise of Flora Macdonald, which he says is 'on a\r\nfair lady's picture, in an honest gentl. seat in the province of St.\r\nDavid's;' in another, Rawlinson sends him, as a contribution to the\r\nOxford collection of verses on the death of Frederick, Prince of Wales,\r\nthis Jacobite epitaph:--\r\n\r\n    'Here lies Fred., Down among the dead;\r\n    Had it been his Father, Most had much rather;\r\n    Had it been his Brother, Better than any other;\r\n    Had it been a Sister, More would have mist her;\r\n    Wer't the whole generation, Happy for the nation;\r\n    But since it is only Fred., There is no more to be said.'\r\n\r\n[211] Rawl. MS. C. 989.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1749.\r\n\r\nA Runic Primstaff, or Clog Almanack, was given by Mr. Guy Dickens, a\r\ngentleman-commoner of Ch. Ch. It is now exhibited, together with another\r\n(_see_ p. 105), in the glass case near the entrance of the Library.\r\nPointer, in his _Oxoniensis Academia_ (p. 143), mentions that an\r\nexplanation of the Primstaff was given by himself; the Accounts show\r\nthat it was also in this year.\r\n\r\nA number of coins were added to the Numismatic Museum, which had been\r\ncollected by the late Librarian, Fysher.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1750.\r\n\r\nA copy _on vellum_, with illuminated initials, &c., of vol. i. (reaching\r\nto the Psalms) of the Vulgate Bible, printed by Fust and Schoeffer in\r\n1462, was bought for £2 10_s._! The volume was imperfect at the end,\r\nceasing at Job xxxii. 5, and seven leaves followed in contemporary and\r\nbeautiful MS., which also ended imperfectly at Ps. xxxvi. 9, with one\r\nleaf wanting at the end of Job. But when the Canonici Collection of MSS.\r\nwas received from Venice, in 1818, among some fragments which were found\r\nin one of the boxes were fourteen leaves of a MS. Bible, which were at\r\nonce recognised as being part of those wanted to complete this book, and\r\nwhich left only four still deficient. The volume came to the Library\r\nfrom the collection of Nic. Jos. Foucault, 'Comes Consistorianus,' many\r\nother of whose MSS. and printed books came by Rawlinson's bequest; but\r\nthrough how many hands the missing leaves had passed in the seventy\r\nsubsequent years ere they were thus marvellously restored to their\r\nplace, it is impossible to tell[212].\r\n\r\n[212] The story of this recovery has been already related by Archd.\r\nCotton in his _Typographical Gazetteer_, p. 339, where by mistake he\r\nrefers the original purchase to the year 1752.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1751.\r\n\r\nA benefaction from Lord Crewe, Bishop of Durham, of £60 to the Librarian\r\nand of £10 for the purchase of books, appears for the first time in the\r\nAccounts for this year. These sums (which are still annually paid into\r\nthe General Fund) proceed from a bequest of £200 _per ann._ from Crewe\r\n(who died Sept. 24, 1721) to the University. A proposal to give these\r\nsame sums to the Library, with other assignments for the remainder, was\r\nbrought forward in Convocation on June 5, 1723, but the scheme was then\r\nrejected[213]. And thus nearly thirty years seem to have elapsed from\r\nthe time of the bequest before the share for the Library was definitely\r\nfixed and paid.\r\n\r\nCharles Gray, M.P. for Colchester, presented a MS. Roll, containing a\r\nSurvey of the estates of the Abbey of Glastonbury at the Dissolution,\r\nwhich is printed by Hearne in his Appendix to Langtoft's _Chronicle_,\r\nvol. ii. pp. 343-388, from a copy made from this original; and an\r\ninscription, in the Phœnician language, upon a white marble stone,\r\nwhich was brought, with many others, from Citium, in the island of\r\nCyprus, by Dr. Porter, a physician of Thaxted in Essex. The stone\r\nmeasures twelve inches in length, by three in breadth, and three in\r\ndepth. It has been frequently engraved: first by Pocock (_Travels in the\r\nEast_, vol. ii. pl. xxxiii. 2); next by Swinton (_Inscriptiones Citieæ_,\r\n1750, and _Philos. Trans._ 1764); afterwards by Chandler, Barthélemy,\r\n&c; and, lastly, by Gesenius (for whom former copies were collated with\r\nthe original, and corrected, by Mr. Reay) in his _Scripturæ Linguæque\r\nPhœniciæ Monumenta_, published in 1837, where the inscription is\r\ndescribed at pp. 126-133, part i., and engraved at pl. xi. part iii. It\r\nappears to be an epitaph by a husband in memory of his wife. The stone\r\nis now kept in one of the Sub-librarians' studies.\r\n\r\nThomas Shaw, the well-known Eastern traveller, bequeathed his collection\r\nof natural curiosities, which was sent to the Ashmolean Museum, and the\r\nMS. of his own travels, with corrections, and other papers. Copies of\r\nCaxton's _Game of the Chesse_ and _Recuyell of Troye_ were given by Mr.\r\nJames Bowen, of Shrewsbury, painter[214].\r\n\r\n[213] Hearne's _Diary_, xcvii. 12.\r\n\r\n[214] A MS. vol. of collections by him relating to the history of\r\nShropshire, dated 1768, is among Gough's books, Salop MS. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1753.\r\n\r\nIn May of this year died Henry Hyde, Lord Cornbury, son of Henry Hyde,\r\nEarl of Rochester, and great-grandson of the great Earl of Clarendon. He\r\nhad made a will bequeathing all the Chancellor's MSS. to the University\r\nof Oxford, to be printed at their press, and the profits to be devoted\r\nto a school for riding and other athletic exercises in the University,\r\nshould such an institution be accepted, or else to other approved uses.\r\nDying before his father, through the effects of an accident, his bequest\r\nwas void, as he was never actually in possession of the papers to which\r\nit referred; but after the death of his father in Dec. following, his\r\nsisters, who were the co-heiresses, carried out his will, by sending all\r\nthe Clarendon MSS. in their possession to the University on the same\r\nconditions[215]. From these was published in 1759 (in which year the\r\npapers appear to have been deposited in the Library) the _Life_ of the\r\nfirst Earl, reprinted in several editions up to the year 1827. This was\r\nfollowed, in 1767-73, by the publication, under the editorship of Dr.\r\nRich. Scrope, of Magd. Coll., of vols. i., ii. of a selection from the\r\n_State Papers_; of which vol. iii. appeared under the editorship of Mr.\r\nThos. Monkhouse, of Queen's Coll., in 1786. During the progress of this\r\npublication, however, the original collection of MSS. papers was very\r\nlargely increased by the acquisition of various portions which had long\r\nbefore been detached. Some were obtained, before the publication of vol.\r\ni., from the executors of Rich. Powney, LL.D.; and many were presented\r\nto the University, before the publication of vol. ii., by the Radcliffe\r\nTrustees, who had bought them for £170 when sold by auction in 1764 by\r\nthe executors of Joseph Radcliffe, Esq., one of the executors to Edward,\r\nthird Earl of Clarendon, who died in 1723. Dr. Douglas (afterwards\r\nBishop of Salisbury), who was employed in the latter purchase, himself\r\nbought and gave some MSS. which had belonged to Mr. Guthrie, and was\r\ninstrumental also in procuring some letters from Viscountess Middleton,\r\n&c. Again, before the publication of vol. iii. many further papers were\r\npurchased by the Radcliffe Trustees from a Mr. Richards, near Salisbury\r\n(from whose father Mr. Powney had obtained his portion), and from Mr. W.\r\nM. Godschall, of Albury, Surrey. And lastly, about eight or ten years\r\nago, several boxes (including Clarendon's own iron-bound _escritoire_),\r\ncontaining miscellaneous papers, were forwarded by the Clarendon\r\nTrustees in final discharge of their trust.\r\n\r\nA MS. of the _History of the Rebellion_, in seven volumes, together with\r\none of the _Contemplations_, in three volumes, was forwarded in 1785 or\r\n1786 by the Duke of Queensbury. The former MS. appears to be that from\r\nwhich the first edition was printed by the Earl of Rochester[216].\r\n\r\nA complete Calendar of the _Clarendon State Papers_ is now in progress\r\nunder the care of several editors. As far as it has advanced, it has\r\nproved the good judgment and the extreme correctness with which the\r\nprinted selection was made; but as that selection ended with the\r\nRestoration, while the papers themselves reach on to 1667, the year of\r\nthe Earl's banishment, the later portion may be expected to contain much\r\nof fresh interest and value.\r\n\r\nIt was in this year also that the first portion of the MSS. of Thomas\r\nCarte, the 'Englishman' and historian, came to the Library. It has been\r\nuniversally supposed that his voluminous and invaluable collections came\r\n_en masse_ subsequently to his death, but the Library Register shows\r\nthat Oxford was indebted to him for a considerable and important portion\r\nduring his life. In this year we find that he sent the papers which\r\nrelate to the life of the great Duke of Ormonde, with a large number of\r\nothers bearing on the history of Ireland from the time of Queen\r\nElizabeth, comprised in thirty volumes folio and quarto. In the\r\nfollowing year, shortly before his death (which occurred on April 2,\r\n1754) he forwarded twenty-six more of his Irish volumes, in folio,\r\nmarked A, B, C, D, &c. And in 1757 nine more of the same series were\r\nforwarded by his widow from Caldecot, near Abingdon, according to an\r\nentry in the old Catalogue, which appears to correspond to one in the\r\nannual Register to the effect that four more boxes were forwarded by the\r\nexecutors, 'by order of Rev. Mr. Hill.' The remainder of his collections\r\nwere left in the hands of his widow, who, re-marrying to Mr. Nicholas\r\nJernegan, or Jerningham (of the family seated at Cossey, Norfolk),\r\nbequeathed them, upon her death, to him, with the reversion to the\r\nUniversity of Oxford. While they were in Mr. Jernegan's possession they\r\nwere largely used by Macpherson for his publication of _State Papers_,\r\nfor which use of them £300 were paid; and the agreement entered into by\r\nthe publisher Cadell, when borrowing some of them for this purpose, is\r\npreserved in the MS. Catalogue of the collection. In 1778, however, Mr.\r\nJernegan disposed of his life-interest to the University, for (as\r\nNichols[217] was informed by Price) the sum of £50, and the remainder\r\nwere consequently at once transferred to the Library. The collection\r\nnumbers altogether 180 volumes in folio, fifty-four in quarto, and seven\r\nin octavo, besides several bundles of Carte's own papers; and is\r\naccompanied by a very full list of contents, compiled by Carte himself,\r\nin one folio volume. The mass of papers relating to Ireland which these\r\nvolumes contain is enormous, drawn chiefly from the stores accumulated\r\nby Ormonde at Kilkenny Castle; to which are added miscellaneous\r\nhistorical collections derived from Lords Huntingdon, Sandwich, and\r\nWharton. There are, also, several volumes of extracts and papers,\r\ncollected with immediate reference to Carte's _History of England_. And\r\na third, and especially interesting, portion consists of the papers of\r\nMr. David Nairne, under-secretary to James II during his exile, which\r\nreach from 1692 to 1718, and fill two volumes in folio and eight or nine\r\nin quarto. It was from these that Macpherson chiefly compiled his\r\n_Original Papers_, published in 1775, in 2 vols., 4^o. A Report upon the\r\ncontents of the collection, with special reference to Ireland (omitting\r\nthe Nairne papers) was made to the Master of the Rolls by T. Duffus\r\nHardy, Esq., and Rev. J. S. Brewer in 1863, and was printed in the\r\nfollowing year, together with an extremely useful summary of the\r\ncontents of the various volumes, and a reference-table of the letters,\r\n&c., printed by Carte in his Ormonde volumes. In consequence of this\r\nReport, two Commissioners (the Rev. Dr. Russell, President of Maynooth,\r\nand J. P. Prendergast, Esq.) were appointed to examine the whole series,\r\nand select for transcription all historical and official papers of\r\ninterest relating to Ireland, with a view to the preservation of copies\r\nin the Record Office at Dublin. Several transcribers are therefore now\r\ncontinuously employed in transcribing for this purpose the papers\r\nselected by the Commissioners. Some notice of the MSS. is to be found in\r\nthe Record Commission Report for 1800, p. 354.\r\n\r\n[215] On Feb. 4, 1868, a scheme for the appropriation of the accumulated\r\nfund (now amounting to about £12,000), which had been approved by the\r\nClarendon Trustees, was accepted by Convocation. The money is to be\r\napplied to the erection of laboratories, &c., at the University Museum,\r\nfor the Professor of Experimental Philosophy.\r\n\r\n[216] In the Benefaction Book this gift is entered under 1793, but it is\r\nmentioned in the Preface to vol. iii. of the _State Papers_, dated May\r\n29, 1786, as having been '_lately_' given. Another copy of part of the\r\n_History_, partly written by William Edgeman, who was Hyde's secretary\r\nat Scilly and during his first exile, came to the Library among\r\nRawlinson's MSS., by whom it was bought at the sale of the Chandos\r\nLibrary in 1747 for £1 10_s._!\r\n\r\n[217] _Lit. Anecd._ ii. 514.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1754.\r\n\r\nIn this year the MS. collections of Rev. John Walker, D.D., of Exeter\r\n(son of Endymion Walker, of Exeter; born 1674, dec. 1747[218]), from\r\nwhich he compiled his valuable and laborious work, _The Sufferings of\r\nthe Clergy_, were forwarded to the Library by his son, William Walker, a\r\ndruggist in Exeter, as appears from a letter from the latter preserved\r\namong papers relating to the Library in the Librarian's study. The\r\nannual accounts, however, mention the gift under the year 1756. Dr.\r\nWalker had expressed in his book (_pref._ p. xliii.) his intention to\r\ndeposit his papers in some public repository, and his purpose was\r\nfortunately thus carried out. The papers have recently been bound, and\r\nnow form twelve volumes in folio and eleven in quarto, with a few papers\r\nstill in bundles[219]. A large number of letters from many among the\r\nsufferers and their representatives are here preserved; but,\r\nunfortunately, Walker's own handwriting is often hard to decipher. Many\r\npamphlets which belonged to him (identified by the peculiar handwriting\r\nin MS. notes) are amongst a vast series recently bound and placed in\r\ncontinuation of the Godwyn Tracts; and several volumes of pamphlets\r\nwritten by Dissenters were given by himself in the years 1719-21.\r\n\r\nThe name of Hogarth occurs in the list of donors, as presenting his two\r\nengravings of the _Analysis of Beauty_, which he had published in the\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\n[218] His successor in his Exeter prebend was appointed in that year.\r\n\r\n[219] The present writer, in answer to an enquiry in _Notes and Queries_\r\nin 1862 (3rd series, i. 218), said that these papers were amongst the\r\n_Rawlinson_ MSS. This mistake arose from the fact that the least\r\nimportant portion had recently been found in a mass of papers belonging\r\nto that collection, but they did not at any time themselves form part of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1755.\r\n\r\nThis year is remarkable for the number and variety of the collections\r\nwith which, during its course, the Library was enriched, comprehending\r\nthose of Rawlinson, Furney, St. Amand, and Ballard.\r\n\r\nOn April 6 died Richard Rawlinson, D.C.L., a Bishop among the\r\nNon-jurors, notwithstanding that he passed in the world as a layman.\r\nFrom the time of Bodley, Laud, and Selden, he was the greatest\r\nbenefactor the Library had known; and his only rivals since his own day\r\nhave been Gough and Douce. In point of numbers, his donation of MSS. far\r\nexceeded all. From the short autobiographical notice of himself, given\r\nin his own collections for a continuation of the _Athenæ Oxon._ (where\r\nhe has inserted a small portrait of himself, engraved, without his name,\r\nby Van der Gucht), we learn the following particulars. He was born Jan.\r\n3, 1689/90, in the Old Bailey, his father being Sir Thos. Rawlinson, who\r\nwas Lord Mayor of London in 1706. On March 9, 1707/8 (having been\r\npreviously at St. Paul's School and Eton), he was matriculated as a\r\ncommoner of St. John's College; but in consequence of the death of his\r\nfather in the same year, he became a gentleman-commoner in 1709; B.A.,\r\nOct. 10, 1711[220]; M.A., July 5, 1713; Governor of Bridewell and\r\nBethlehem Hospitals, 1713; F.R.S., 1714; ordained (among the Non-jurors)\r\nDeacon, Sept. 21, and Priest, Sept. 23, 1716[221]. He then travelled\r\nthrough the whole of England, except some of the northern parts, and in\r\n1719 went into Normandy, where, while staying at Rouen, he received\r\nfrom Oxford the degree of D.C.L. by diploma of June 30. Thence he went\r\nto the Low Countries, where, in Sept., he was admitted into the\r\nUniversities of both Utrecht and Leyden, and returned into England in\r\nNov. On June 12 in the following year, he started on a longer journey,\r\nwhich he extended through Holland, France, Germany, the whole of Italy,\r\nand Sicily, to Malta; and returned on the death of his elder brother\r\nThomas, also a well-known book-collector, in 1726. During his six years'\r\ntravels, he had seen, he remarks, four Popes[222]. Admitted F.S.A. May\r\n10, 1727. On March 25, 1728, he was consecrated Bishop, by Bishops\r\nGandy, Doughty, and Blackbourne, in Gandy's Chapel[223]. Appointed a\r\nGovernor of St. Bartholomew's Hospital in March, 1733. He resided at\r\nLondon House, Aldersgate, so called from having been in early days a\r\nmansion of the Bishops of London. During his lifetime he was a constant\r\nbenefactor to the Library; in the years 1733-4-5-7-8-9 and 1750, he is\r\nentered in the great Register for special gifts of coins, books, and\r\npictures. Some hundreds of printed books, now in the gallery called\r\n'_Jur._,' and elsewhere, were given by him at these times; while many of\r\nthe Holbeins and other valuable portraits in the Picture Gallery came\r\nfrom him[224]. A few MSS. also came from him during his lifetime which\r\nare now placed in the general Bodley collection. But at his death all\r\nhis collections came _en masse_[225]; collections formed abroad and at\r\nhome, the choice of book-auctions, the pickings of chandlers' and\r\ngrocers' waste-paper, everything, especially, in the shape of a MS.,\r\nfrom early copies of Classics and Fathers to the well-nigh most recent\r\nlog-books of sailors' voyages[226]. Not a sale of MSS. occurred,\r\napparently, in London, during his time, at which he was not an\r\nomnigenous purchaser; so that students of every subject now bury\r\nthemselves in his stores with great content and profit. But history in\r\nall its branches, heraldry and genealogy, biography and topography, are\r\nhis specially strong points. The printed books bequeathed by him in\r\nselection from his whole library (of which those in quarto and smaller\r\nsizes are still called by his name) amounted to between 1800 and\r\n1900[227], but the MSS. to upwards of 4800, besides a large number of\r\nold charters and miscellaneous unsorted deeds.\r\n\r\nThe staff of the Library being very small at the time, as well as\r\nill-paid[228], and such an accession being completely overwhelming, the\r\nofficers appear to have contented themselves with duly entering the\r\nprinted books, while leaving the MSS. entirely neglected. About the\r\nbeginning of the present century some steps were taken towards a\r\nCatalogue, and a portion were arranged and numbered; still later,\r\nconsiderably more was done. But it was only on the accession of the\r\npresent Librarian to the Headship, that the full extent of Rawlinson's\r\ncollections was ascertained. Every corner of the Library was then\r\nthoroughly examined, and cupboard after cupboard was found filled with\r\nMSS. and papers huddled together in confusion, while, last not least, a\r\ndark hole under a staircase, explored by the present writer on hands and\r\nknees, afforded a rich 'take,' including many writings of Rawlinson's\r\nNon-juring friends. The whole number of volumes thus brought to light\r\namounted to about 1300.\r\n\r\nThe classes into which the whole collection of MSS. is now divided are\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n1. _Class A_: 500 volumes, chiefly of English history, with a few\r\ntheological books. Amongst these are the _Thurloe State Papers_, in\r\nsixty-seven volumes, of which all of importance were published by Birch,\r\nin seven vols. folio, in 1742. These papers were found after the\r\nRevolution concealed in the ceiling of garrets in Lincoln's Inn, which\r\nbelonged to the rooms formerly occupied by Thurloe; and they still bear\r\ntoo evident marks of the damp to which they were there exposed. They\r\npassed through Lord Somers' and Sir Jos. Jekyll's hands into those of a\r\nbookseller, Fletcher Gyles, from whom Rawlinson obtained them in 1751,\r\nand who, as Rawlinson says, asked at first an 'immoderate price' for\r\nthem. Another series is that of _Miscellaneous Papers of Sam. Pepys_, in\r\ntwenty-five volumes, containing his correspondence, collections on\r\nAdmiralty business, &c.[229] These, together with many other volumes\r\nwhich belonged to Pepys (including many curious dockyard account-books\r\nof the times of Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth) were 'redeemed from\r\n_thus et odores vendentibus_[230].' Of another acquisition Rawlinson\r\nwrites thus:--\r\n\r\n    'There was lately an auction here of Mr. Bridgeman's books,\r\n    curiosities, and MSS., who was formerly clerk of the Council to K.\r\n    James II, and register to the Ecclesiastical Commission. Here I laid\r\n    out some pence, and picked up some curiosities; the original\r\n    minute-book of the High Commission, the proceedings every session\r\n    with the names of those present, by which it appears that Bp. Sprat\r\n    was not so innocent as he would persuade us in his letter to the\r\n    Earl of Dorset to think, and that notwithstanding all his shiftings\r\n    he sat to the penultim. Session of that Court;' [Letters canvassing\r\n    the nobility, gentry, justices of the peace, &c., in favour of the\r\n    repeal of the Test;] '3 letters from the D. of Monmouth, two to the\r\n    King and one to the Queen, desiring an audience in which he would\r\n    give them such satisfaction, ... very pathetic, and deserved at\r\n    least some attention[231]; ... several volumes of treaties, ...\r\n    instructions to ambassadors. Very remarkable are those to Lord\r\n    Castlemain on his going to Rome, the King's two letters to the Pope,\r\n    a third of revocation, all personal and complement, but no embassy\r\n    of obedience. Copy-books of letters, private and public, wrote by K.\r\n    Charles and K. James II, from which might be collected such a fund\r\n    of true tho' secret history, that the prize is not to be\r\n    valued[232], and will, I hope, be a standing monument of great\r\n    events, and preserved in Bodley's repository, with the papers of Bp.\r\n    Turner and other great men at and since the year 1688[233].'\r\n\r\nThere are also some papers in this class and in Class C which belonged\r\nto Archbp. Wake, about which Rawlinson writes, on June 24, 1741[234]:--\r\n\r\n    'My agent last week met with some papers of Archbp. Wake at a\r\n    chandler's shop; this is unpardonable in his executors, as all his\r\n    MSS. were left to Christ Church. But quære whether these did not\r\n    fall into some servant's hands who was ordered to burn them, and Mr.\r\n    Martin Folkes ought to have seen that done. They fell into the\r\n    curate's hands of St. George, Bloomsbury.'\r\n\r\n2. _Class B_ numbers 520 volumes nominally, but really, including double\r\nnumbers, 534. They comprise heraldry and genealogy (including MSS. of\r\nSir Richard and Sir Thos. St. George, W. Wyrley, Guillim, Ryley, Glover,\r\nLe Neve, and other heralds) English and Irish history, and topography,\r\nincluding several monastic chartularies. Among the genealogical MSS. is\r\na remarkable collection of pedigrees, in twelve volumes, which the\r\npresent writer ascertained to have been compiled by Thomas Wilkinson,\r\nVicar of Laurence Waltham, Berks, between about 1647 and 1681. They are\r\narranged alphabetically, as far as the letter P in tolerable order and\r\nregularity, but thenceforward only in a rough and incomplete state.\r\nUnfortunately the handwriting is far from clear, and the ink has often\r\nmade it worse. Among the volumes relating to _Essex_, _Norfolk_,\r\n_Suffolk_, &c., are twelve or thirteen which belonged to William Holman,\r\na voluminous collector for the first-mentioned county, who incorporated\r\nthe gatherings of Rev. John Ousley and Thos. Jekyll. Morant, the\r\nhistorian of Essex, obtained the larger portion of Holman's books; some\r\nare in the British Museum; and the remainder ('the refuse,' says Morant)\r\nwere bought by Rawlinson in 1752 for £10[235]. Besides the\r\nabove-mentioned volumes, there are a large number of Holman's MSS. which\r\nare kept distinct, and which have been recently bound in fourteen folio\r\nvolumes, eleven quarto, and five octavo. Under _London_ are some\r\nnineteen or twenty volumes of Diocesan papers which belonged to Bp. John\r\nRobinson. They formed (with one volume in Class A and several in Class\r\nC) a mass which are described by Rawlinson, as follows[236]:--\r\n\r\n    'I lately rescued from the grocers, chandlers, &c. a parcel of\r\n    papers once the property of Compton and Robinson, successively Bps.\r\n    of London. Amongst those of the first were original subscription and\r\n    visitation books, letters and conferences during the apprehensions\r\n    of Popery amongst the clergy of this diocese, remarkable\r\n    intelligences relating to Burnet and the Orange Court in Holland in\r\n    those extraordinary times before 1688[237], minutes of the\r\n    proceedings of the Commissioners for the Propagation of the Gospel,\r\n    and a great variety of other papers. Amongst those of Bp. Robinson,\r\n    numbers of originals relating to the transactions at the treaty of\r\n    Utrecht, copies of his own letters to Lord Bolingbroke, and\r\n    originals from Lord Bolingbroke, Lord Oxford, Electress and Elector\r\n    of Hanover, Ormonde, Strafford, Prior, &c.; letters from the Scots\r\n    deprived Bishops to Compton, and variety of State papers. They\r\n    belonged to one Mr. [Anth.] Gibbon, lately dead, who was private\r\n    secretary to both the afore-mentioned prelates.'\r\n\r\nUnder _Bucks_ are Rawlinson's own collections for a history of Eton\r\nCollege, and under _Middlesex_ and _Oxon._ his parochial collections for\r\nthose counties. The _Irish_ MSS. include many of great antiquity and\r\nvalue which formerly belonged to Sir James Ware, _e.g._ Tigernach's\r\nAnnals, Annals of Ulster, Lives of Saints, Dublin Chartularies, Arms of\r\nIrish families, Irish poems, &c. Among them is the often noticed Life of\r\nSt. Columba by Magnus O'Donnell, written in 1532, which was bought by\r\nRawlinson at the Chandos sale for twenty-three shillings.\r\n\r\nOf these two classes a Catalogue, in one volume quarto, was printed in\r\n1862, which was compiled by the writer of this volume[238]. A full index\r\nto the contents of all the MSS. has been made, which remains at present\r\nunprinted, but may possibly at some time appear in conjunction with a\r\nvolume describing the contents of the succeeding class.\r\n\r\n3. _Class C_ comprehends 989 MSS. of very miscellaneous character, but\r\nchiefly consisting of law, history and theology, with a few medical\r\nworks. Among the theological portion are papers of John Dury, the\r\nzealous labourer for union amongst Protestants in the time of Charles I,\r\npapers of Bedell and Usher, some volumes of John Lewis of Margate[239],\r\nand some interesting Service-books of English use, including a\r\nPontifical given to Salisbury Cathedral by Bp. Roger de Martivale\r\nbetween 1315-1329, and an early Oseney book. Several volumes consist of\r\npapers of Dr. Chamberlaine (author of _Notitia Angliæ_) and Mr. Henry\r\nNewman, secretaries of the Societies for the Propagation of the Gospel,\r\nand Promoting Christian Knowledge, which, Rawlinson mentions in a\r\nletter, dated April 28, 1744, (Ballard MS. ii.) that he had then\r\nrecently purchased. Some seventeen or eighteen volumes came from the\r\nlibrary of Bp. Turner of Ely (together with others in the classes called\r\n_Miscellaneous_ and _Letters_), containing papers of himself and his\r\nbrother, Dr. Thomas Turner, Dean of Canterbury. These were obtained by\r\nRawlinson in 1742, who in them became master, as he says, of a\r\nconsiderable treasure for ten guineas[240].' Early English poets are\r\nrepresented by Lydgate, Rolle of Hampole, William of Nassyngton, and\r\nothers[241]; and one volume contains a few Welsh verses. A catalogue\r\nexists in MS. The volumes relating to English history in classes A and C\r\nare noticed in the return printed in the Record Commission Report for\r\n1800, pp. 348-353.\r\n\r\n4. The class entitled _Miscellaneous_ numbers about 1400 volumes, and\r\nincludes the greater part of those which were discovered in 1861. They\r\nare so entirely miscellaneous that it is impossible to give in a few\r\nlines a real idea of their nature. History, travels, biography, and\r\nreligious controversy largely prevail. There are papers of Sir Thos.\r\nBrowne, Dr. Dee, Maittaire, Peter Le Neve, Ashmole[242], John Dunton,\r\nand Bagford, with a very large mass of _Hearniana_. Of the Non-jurors,\r\nthere are papers of Grascome, Gandy, Spinckes, Hickes, Fitzwilliams,\r\nHowell, and Dean Granville. Some nine or ten volumes are occupied with\r\nthe accounts of the Royal Surveyor of Works from 1532 to 1545. The\r\nChurch-wardens' accounts of Sutterton, Lincolnshire, from 1493 to 1536,\r\nand of St. Peter's, Cornhill, from 1664 to 1689, are also found\r\nhere[243]. There is a large series of Italian MSS. (amongst other\r\nforeign books, chiefly French) which bear on English history, as\r\ncontaining copies of reports made to Rome by Papal agents and to Venice\r\nby ambassadors, together with the proceedings at many conclaves. These\r\nwere bought by Rawlinson at Sir Jos. Jekyll's sale of the Somers' MSS.\r\nin 1739, for £3 15_s._[244] There is also a mass of papers of J. J.\r\nZamboni, Venetian Resident in England, and a friend of Maittaire. A\r\nconsiderable number of autograph signatures, barbarously cut out from\r\nvarious books, by Thomas Rawlinson, were found in loose papers; these\r\nhave now been mounted and bound in two volumes. There are not, however,\r\nmany of interest among them, except several of Ben Jonson.\r\n\r\n5. In _Letters_ there are upwards of 100 volumes, comprising all the\r\nmultifarious correspondence of Hearne with Anstis, Bagford, Baker,\r\nBarnes, Dodwell, Smith, &c., the correspondence of Rawlinson, Dr. Thomas\r\nTurner, and Bishop Francis Turner, Philip Lord Wharton, and Sir Edm.\r\nWarcupp. One volume contains a few letters by Dryden, Pope, Edw. Young,\r\n&c. There is also a series of letters in three vols. relating to Dr.\r\nJohn Polyander, of Kerckhoven, Professor of Divinity at Leyden, and\r\neight or nine volumes of Vossius' correspondence, being the originals\r\nfrom which the folio volume published at London in 1691 was printed.\r\n\r\n6. The class of _Poetry_ contains 221 volumes, including Chaucer,\r\nHoccleve, Lydgate, Capgrave (Life of St. Catherine), and Rolle of\r\nHampole, with Piers Plowman and the Romance of Parthenope of Blois (both\r\nimperfect). The majority are miscellaneous poems and plays of the\r\nseventeenth century. One volume, containing the words of anthems with\r\nthe composers' names, is supposed to be the Chapel-book used by Charles\r\nI.\r\n\r\nOf the three last-mentioned classes, a brief MS. list was drawn up with\r\ngreat neatness and accuracy by Dr. Bliss, in 1812 (reaching in the case\r\nof the _Miscell._ only as far as No. 407); an index, in continuation, to\r\nall the later additions is now in process of formation.\r\n\r\n7. Of _Sermons_ there are about 200 volumes; many of which are by\r\nNon-jurors, including three by Rawlinson himself. Ten volumes are by\r\nDan. Price, Dean of St. Asaph, 1696-1706; and one volume is said to\r\ncontain unpublished sermons by Leighton, apparently from notes taken by\r\nsome auditor at the time of delivery. These have been copied for\r\npublication in a proposed new edition (under the care of Rev. W. West,\r\nof Nairn, N.B.) of Leighton's whole works.\r\n\r\n8. A selection of Biblical and Classical MSS., with a few others,\r\namounting to 199, are placed in the case marked '_Auctarium_,' G.\r\nAmongst these are a few Greek volumes, with critical _Adversaria_ of\r\nMaittaire, Josh. Lasher, and J. G. Grævius. Early copies of Statius,\r\nOvid, Virgil, &c. form part of the classics; while among the Biblical\r\nMSS. is a grand eighth-century copy (written in rounded minuscules, in\r\nthe same style as the Rushworth book) of the Gospels of St. Luke and St.\r\nJohn, and a beautiful eleventh-century Psalter with the commentary of\r\nSt. Bruno. One other fine book is a Psalter written for Ch. Ch.\r\nCathedral, Dublin, by the care of Stephen Derby, Prior, about A.D.\r\n1360-80, with remarkable miniatures illustrating Psalms xxxix, liii,\r\nlxix, lxxxi, and xcviii.\r\n\r\n9. Of _Missals_, _Horæ_, and other Service-books, there are (besides\r\nthose which are scattered in Classes C and G Auct.) about 130. These\r\n(most of which are of French origin, bought out of the library of Nic.\r\nJos. Foucault[245], of Flemish, or of Italian) are now incorporated with\r\na large collection of Liturgical books, which are called _Canon.\r\nLiturg._, from their having formed part of the Canonici collection\r\npurchased in 1818.\r\n\r\n10. A small collection of _Statutes_, comprising sixty-five volumes, is\r\nkept distinct. They consist of the Statutes of various Colleges at\r\nOxford and Cambridge, of the Cathedrals of Lichfield, Hereford,\r\nWorcester, Chester, Manchester, Canterbury, Exeter, and the Abbey of\r\nWestminster; of the Order of the Garter (various copies); of Hospitals\r\nat Croydon, Chipping-Barnet, and Chichester; of the Gresham Charities,\r\ntogether with the Charters of London and Bristol; Statutes made by the\r\nChapter of Paris for the Church of the Holy Sepulchre there in 1421, and\r\nan eighteenth-century transcript of the Statutes of the College at\r\nBayeux. But the volume of most interest in this class is the rare\r\nprinted volume of the Statutes of Thame School, issued in 1575. Of this,\r\nonly five other copies are known, one kept at the School itself, a\r\nsecond in the custody of the Warden of New College (the Visitor of the\r\nSchool), a third in the Royal Library, Brit. Mus., and the fourth and\r\nfifth, both on vellum, in the possession of the Earl of Abingdon and in\r\nthe Grenville Library, Brit. Mus. Rawlinson's copy, which wants the\r\ntitle, has in it the book-plate of John, Duke of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n11. Of the MSS. of Dr. Thomas Smith, the Non-juror, of Magd. Coll.,\r\nOxford, there are 139 volumes, which (with the exception of a few\r\nbequeathed by Smith himself) came into Rawlinson's hands together with\r\nthe rest of Hearne's collections. They are noticed above, under the year\r\n1735.\r\n\r\n12. Besides the multitude of books, scattered throughout every class of\r\nRawlinson's library, which belonged to Hearne or were written by him,\r\nthere are about 150 small duodecimo volumes of Hearne's daily diary and\r\nnote-books, commencing in July, 1705, and ending on June 4, 1735, the\r\nlast actual entry being on June 1, and his decease occurring on June 10.\r\nThe character of this diary is well known from the two volumes of\r\nExtracts published by Dr. Bliss in 1857, with the title, _Reliquiæ\r\nHearnianæ_. But it must not be supposed that these volumes comprehend\r\nall that deserves publication; the diary throughout is full of like\r\ncurious personal history and anecdote, antiquarian gleanings and amusing\r\ngossip, mixed, of course, with a good deal of occasional acrimony\r\nagainst those with whom Hearne came in collision either from\r\ndifferences in academic or literary matters, or from their being\r\nfriends of the 'Elector of Hanover.' There is scarcely a subject falling\r\nwithin its writer's scope of observation on which this Diary may not be\r\nconsulted; and as it is written in his usual plain and neat hand, with\r\nan index to each volume, it is fortunately easy for reference. Hearne\r\nbequeathed all his MSS., and books with MSS. notes, to Mr. William\r\nBedford, son of the well-known bishop among the Non-jurors, Hilkiah\r\nBedford; the legatee died on July 11, 1747, and Rawlinson bought them of\r\nhis widow for £105. Hence it was that they came finally to the place\r\nwhere Hearne would himself have rejoiced to see them deposited. The\r\nautobiographical sketch of Hearne's own life, which Huddesford published\r\nin 1772, in conjunction with the lives of Leland and Wood, is preserved\r\namong the _Miscellaneous_ MSS. Of this Rawlinson says, in a letter dated\r\nJune 19, 1740[246]: 'Tom's own life was so low and poor a performance\r\nthat I recommended it to Bedford to burn.' On account, probably, of the\r\nnumerous reflections which the Diary contained on living persons,\r\nRawlinson ordered in his bequest that it should not be open to\r\ninspection until after the lapse of seven years. He laid also the same\r\nrestraint upon the use of his own papers noticed in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\n13. Large collections were made by Rawlinson for a continuation of\r\nWood's _Athenæ Oxon._ These contain much valuable biographical\r\ninformation, derived in very many cases from the actual information of\r\nthe persons noticed, letters from many of whom are inserted. There are,\r\nin all, twenty-five volumes, folio and quarto; among the folios there\r\nare two series of notices arranged alphabetically, and one volume (also\r\nalphabetical) of notices of Cambridge men admitted _ad eundem_; the\r\nquartos contain 1331 notices, numbered but not arranged in any other\r\norder, with one general alphabetical index. These collections, together\r\nwith Hearne's Diaries, and Rawlinson's Non-jurors' Papers, and notes of\r\nhis own Travels, were included in a fourth and last codicil, dated Feb.\r\n14, 1755, which directed that all these papers should be kept locked up\r\nduring a period of seven years. By the same codicil also were conveyed\r\nnumerous engravings by Vertue, portraits of Englishmen, some paintings,\r\nand a collection of Roman, Persian, Italian, and English medals[247].\r\nSome of the Italian medals, particularly a fine set in copper of the\r\nmembers of the House of Medici, are now exhibited in a case in the\r\nPicture Gallery[248]. By a codicil of June 17, 1752, Rawlinson had\r\npreviously bequeathed a series of medals of Popes, of which he remarks,\r\n'as they are, I take them to be one of the most complete collections now\r\nin Europe;' together with twenty shillings _per annum_ for enlarging and\r\ncontinuing the set[249].\r\n\r\n14. Finally (as regards MSS.), Rawlinson left a mass of ancient\r\ncharters, five hundred of which were catalogued by Mr. Coxe some years\r\nago, and of vellum deeds and documents of all kinds, chiefly of the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries. He left, also, all the\r\ncopper-plates containing engravings of some of his ancient documents and\r\nother curiosities, as well as a large number of impressions from these\r\nplates. Many of these impressions were sold at the sale of Bodleian\r\nduplicates in 1862. The copper-plates were added to his bequest by a\r\nsecond codicil, dated July 25, 1754, in which he desired that\r\nimpressions should be taken from them, to be sold in one volume for the\r\nuse and benefit of the University. A last item in Rawlinson's\r\nmiscellaneous gifts (besides various bas-reliefs, figures, a Jewish\r\nvessel, Muscovite cup, &c.) was a large collection of matrices of\r\nancient conventual and personal seals, chiefly foreign; together with\r\nimpressions of seals, ancient and modern, in metal and wax, 'most of\r\nwhich,' it is said in the Will (p. 4), 'were of the collection of Mr.\r\nCharles Christian, the celebrated seal engraver.' The wax impressions\r\nare now exhibited in the Picture Gallery.\r\n\r\nDistinct from Rawlinson's other printed books is a curious series of\r\nAlmanacs, in 175 volumes, extending from 1607 to 1747, which were sent\r\nto the Library in 1752. Some volumes in continuation, from 1747 to 1768,\r\nwere given by Sir Rob. H. Inglis, Bart., in 1846[250]. Another series,\r\nbetween 1571 and 1663, is in the Ashmole collection.\r\n\r\nBy his second codicil, of July 25, 1754, Rawlinson bequeathed a fee-farm\r\nrent of £4 _per annum_ to the Under-librarian, in consideration of his\r\ntaking charge of the MSS., but clogged with the strange conditions that\r\nhe should not be a doctor in any faculty, married, or in Holy\r\nOrders[251]. The receipt of this sum is entered in the Accounts for\r\n1756, but in no subsequent year.\r\n\r\nThe following is an alphabetical list of the principal libraries from\r\nwhich Rawlinson's MSS. were collected, with the dates (so far as\r\nascertained) at which these libraries were dispersed:--\r\n\r\n  Acton (Oliver), of Bridewell Hosp.\r\n  Bacon (Thos. Sclater), 1737.\r\n  Bridgeman (Will. & Rich.), 1742.\r\n  Chandos (Duke of), 1747.\r\n  Clarendon (Henry, Earl of). Through _Chandos_.\r\n  Clavell (Walter), 1742.\r\n  Compton (Bishop).

The printed books (nineteen in all)\r\nconsisted almost entirely of early editions of classics. The MSS. (six\r\nfolio volumes) are thus described in a list made by the Librarian,\r\nHumphrey Owen, at the time of their receipt:--\r\n\r\n    '1, 2, 3 and 4 contain collections relating to the history and\r\n    antiquities of the city, church and county of Gloucester. 5, 6, a\r\n    fair copy, seemingly prepared for the press, of the history and\r\n    antiquities of the said city, church and county, by the Arch-deacon\r\n    himself, or some friend of his from whom these papers came into his\r\n    hands.'\r\n\r\nThe gift comprised also two ancient brass seals, and eighteen original\r\ndeeds, amongst which is the original confirmation charter granted to\r\nGloucester Abbey, by Burgred King of Mercia, in 862. This remarkable\r\ndeed (which is not printed in Kemble's _Codex_) is in admirable\r\npreservation, is written in seventeen lines, with five lines containing\r\nseventeen signatures, and measures sixteen inches in width and ten and\r\none-third in length. There are also original grants to the abbey from\r\nHen. II and Stephen, and a confirmation, 29 Edw. I, of Magna Charta,\r\nwhich has a magnificent impression of the beautiful great seal. The\r\ndeeds are noticed in the Report on the Public Records for 1800, p. 354.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the death on Sept. 5, 1754, of James St. Amand, Esq.[253] (formerly\r\nof Lincoln College), a bequest of books, MSS., coins, &c. which had been\r\nmade by a will dated Nov. 9, 1749, accrued to the Library, being\r\nreceived in the year 1755. The books consist chiefly of the then modern\r\neditions of the classics, and of the writings of modern Latin scholars;\r\nsuch of them as the Library did not need, were to go to Lincoln\r\nCollege. The MSS., sixty-eight in number, comprise various papers\r\nrelating to the history chiefly of the Low Countries[254], together with\r\nnotes and indices by St. Amand himself to Theocritus and other Greek\r\npoets, Horace, &c. They are described by Mr. Coxe, in vol. i. of the\r\nCatalogue of MSS., cols. 889-908. The main part of the residue of his\r\nproperty was bequeathed to Christ's Hospital, together with a picture of\r\nhis grandfather James St. Amand, done in miniature and set in gold, with\r\nthe singular proviso that the picture should be exhibited, and the part\r\nof the will relating to these bequests be read, at the first annual\r\ncourt of the Hospital, and also that the picture be shown annually to\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor of Oxford, if required. Should a refusal to show the\r\npicture be persistently made, or any of the conditions of the will be\r\navoided, then all the residue was to be given to the University, first\r\nto increase the stipend of the chief Librarian to £120 and of the second\r\nLibrarian to £70, but only so long as both of them were unmarried, and\r\nthen to be devoted to the purchasing of books and MSS., specially of\r\nclassic authors.\r\n\r\nMany of his books have a book-plate, which the author has ascertained to\r\nbe that of Dr. Arthur Charlett; being the initials A. C., interlaced\r\nwith the same repeated in an inverse way, surrounded by piles of books,\r\nand with the motto, 'Animus si æquus, quod petis hîc est.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the bequest of George Ballard (the author of the _Memoirs of Learned\r\nLadies_), who died on June 24, the Library became enriched with\r\nforty-four volumes of Letters, chiefly addressed, by ecclesiastical and\r\nliterary personages of all ranks, to Dr. Arthur Charlett, Master of\r\nUniversity College, between the reigns of James II and George I. For the\r\nbiographical and bibliographical history of the time these letters\r\npossess great interest and value; it was from them that the _Letters by\r\nEminent Persons_, published in 1813, by Rev. John Walker, M.A., Fellow\r\nof New College, were chiefly drawn. No printed catalogue of them has yet\r\nappeared, but the Library possesses a MS. index to the contents of each\r\nvolume, and a more complete and minute index has been recently\r\ncommenced[255]. Besides the Letters, Ballard bequeathed some other MSS.,\r\nin number twenty-three, among which is a volume of various voyages and\r\nexpeditions, 1589-1634; Sir Edm. Warcupp's autograph account of the\r\ntreaty in the Isle of Wight;[256] a dialogue between a tutor and his\r\npupil, by Lord Herbert, of Cherbury; the second book of the\r\n_Supplication of Soules_, by Sir Thos. More, a precious little volume of\r\n103 closely-written duodecimo pages, entirely in the handwriting of the\r\ngreat Chancellor; the _Universitie's Musterings_, by Brian Twyne;\r\ncollections by Ant. à Wood; a small volume of Gloucestershire notes,\r\nsupposed by Guillim; and several volumes written by Mr. Elstob and his\r\nsister. An extract from Ballard's will, with a list of his MSS., is in\r\nthe Register marked 'C.'\r\n\r\nBallard was originally a stay-maker or mantua-maker at Campden,\r\nGloucestershire; but, following the study of antiquities with great\r\nardour, became well known and highly esteemed amongst all of like\r\npursuits. At the age of forty-four he was appointed one of the eight\r\nclerks of Magdalen College, being matriculated Dec. 15, 1750, but never\r\ntook any degree. He bequeathed to the College Library some of his books\r\nwhich were there wanting. The fullest account of him will be found in\r\nvol. ii. of _A Register of St. Mary Magd. College_, by J. R. Bloxam,\r\nD.D., pp. 95-102, 1857. Some letters from him are printed in Nichols'\r\n_Lit. Hist._ iv. 206-226.\r\n\r\nThe very valuable MS. of the letters of Gilbert Foliot, Bishop of London\r\n(which are of great importance for the illustration of the history of\r\nThomas à Becket), now numbered _E. Musæo_ 247, was given by Sir Thomas\r\nCave, Bart. It is described in the Benefaction Book as 'liber\r\nrarissimus; per totam Angliam unum hoc tantum modo exstat exemplar.' The\r\nletters were first printed by Dr. Giles, together with the Lives of\r\nBecket, in his series of _Patres Ecclesiæ Anglicanæ_, in 1845.\r\n\r\n[220] This date is from the _Register of Graduates_; Rawlinson says,\r\nMich. Term, 1710.\r\n\r\n[221] By Bishop Jeremy Collier, in Mr. Laurence's Chapel on College\r\nHill, London. (See a communication from the present writer in _Notes and\r\nQueries_, 3rd series, iii. 244.) He appears to have endeavoured to\r\nconceal from the world his clerical character. In a letter to T.\r\nRawlins, of Pophills, Warw. in 1736, he requests him not to address him\r\nas _Rev._ (Ballard's MSS. ii. 6.) Some volumes of Sermons in his\r\nhandwriting are among his MSS. His writing is of a very broad, rude, and\r\nclumsy character; and it is singular that his brother Thomas wrote a\r\nhand very similar. Richard usually signs only with his initials,\r\nseparated by a cross, 'R + R.'\r\n\r\n[222] The small note-books kept on his journeys, containing epitaphs,\r\ninscriptions, accounts of places visited, &c., are preserved (but,\r\nunfortunately, in an imperfect series) among his Miscellaneous MSS.\r\n\r\n[223] See _Notes and Queries_, 3rd series, i. 225.\r\n\r\n[224] Two beautiful miniature portraits of James Edward, son of James\r\nII, and his wife Clementina Sobieski, which could not, probably, at the\r\ntime be safely exhibited, have recently been exhumed by the Librarian\r\nfrom the obscurity to which they had been consigned, and are now hung in\r\nthe Picture Gallery. In Feb. 1749/50, Rawlinson sent Kelly's 'Holy\r\nTable,' a marble slab, covered with astrological figures (engraved in\r\nDr. Dee's _Actions with Spirits_), which, he says, had been subsequently\r\nin the possession of Lilly. It is now in the Ashmolean Museum.\r\n\r\n[225] By the terms of his will, dated June 2, 1752, and printed in 1755,\r\nhe bequeathed all his MSS. of every kind (excepting private papers and\r\nletters) to the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University, to\r\nbe placed in the Bodleian Library, or in such other place as they should\r\ndeem most proper, for the use and benefit of the University, and of all\r\nother persons, properly and with leave resorting thereto with a view to\r\nthe public good; and to be kept separate and apart from every other\r\ncollection. With these he gave also all his books printed on vellum or\r\nsilk (of which latter kind there are two or three small specimens), all\r\nhis deeds and charters, and all his printed books containing any MSS.\r\nnotes, together with various antiquities and miscellaneous curiosities.\r\nHis MS. and printed music he bequeathed to the Music School. Of the\r\nMusical library preserved in this room, a MS. Catalogue was made a few\r\nyears ago by Rev. Robert Hake, M.A., then Chaplain of New College, now\r\nPrecentor of Canterbury.\r\n\r\n[226] _Apropos_ of log-books, it may be mentioned that whereas it\r\nappears from the eighth Report of the Deputy-Keeper of the Records, p.\r\n26, 1847, that the earliest log among the Admiralty Records is of the\r\nyear 1673, there are several of about the same date and a little earlier\r\nto be found in Rawlinson's collection.\r\n\r\n[227] Among the printed books are two copies of Archbp. Parker's rare\r\n_De Antiq. Eccl. Brit._, 1572. One of these is the identical copy\r\ndescribed by Strype in his _Life of Parker_, and which was then in the\r\npossession of Bp. Fleetwood of Ely; the other (which was given to the\r\nLibrary by Jos. Sanford, B.D., Balliol Coll., in 1753) was presented to\r\nRich. Cosin by John Parker, the Archbishop's eldest son, Jan. 5, 1593.\r\nOwen, the Librarian, notes on the cover that Dr. Rawlinson tells him\r\nthis copy was bought at the sale of the library of his brother, Thos.\r\nRawlinson, by the Earl of Oxford, for £40. A collection of the original\r\nbroadsides proclamations issued during the whole of the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, in beautiful condition, forms a remarkable and splendid\r\nvolume; the collection is complete, except that a few proclamations, of\r\nwhich printed copies are wanting, are supplied in MS. As far as the year\r\n1577 they are printed by Richard Jugge, sometimes alone and sometimes in\r\nconjunction with John Cawood; thenceforward they are printed by the two\r\nBarkers, first by Christopher, and afterwards by Robert. They appear to\r\nhave been collected in the reign of James I. A printed chronological\r\ntable of contents is prefixed, together with a portrait of the Queen,\r\nengraved by Fr. Delaram, with six lines of verse by 'Jo. Davies, Heref.'\r\nAt the year 1559 a leaf is inserted containing the arms of Q. Mary of\r\nScotland quartering those of England (the assumption of which by Mary\r\ngave irreconcileable offence to Q. Eliz.), beautifully painted, with the\r\nnote, 'Sent out of Fraunce, in July, 1559,' and these lines below:--\r\n\r\n    'The armes of Marie Queene Dolphines of ffraunce,\r\n    The nobillest Lady in earth for till aduaunce:\r\n    Off Scotland queene, and of Ingland also,\r\n    Off Ireland als, God haith providit so.'\r\n\r\nThis leaf is one of two copies executed for Cecil and Q. Eliz. Two,\r\nprobably unique, 'red-letter' books are also among the rarities of\r\nRawlinson's printed collection. The one is a Sermon on Ps. iv. 7,\r\npreached before Charles I at Oxford by Josias Howe, B.D., of Trinity\r\nCollege. It is printed entirely in red, and has no title. It was bought,\r\nincluded in a volume of miscellaneous sermons, out of Dr. Charlett's\r\nlibrary, by Hearne, who says in a MS. note that only thirty copies were\r\nprinted. A description of it is given by Dr. Bliss in his _Reliquiæ\r\nHearn._ vol. ii. pp. 960-1, where Hearne's note is printed in full. The\r\nother is a volume entitled, _The Bloody Court; or, the Fatal Tribunal_,\r\nbeing an account of the trial and execution of Charles I. The lengthy\r\ntitle is printed by Dr. Bliss, _ubi supra_. Some few of Rawlinson's\r\nprinted books came to the Library among Gough's, in 1809.\r\n\r\n[228] The salaries being miserably insufficient, the recognised duties\r\nof the officers appear to have been simply the cataloguing the few books\r\nthat were received in ordinary course, and attending upon the readers.\r\nConsequently for any other work, for arranging or cataloguing any new\r\ncollections, &c., special payments were always made. A somewhat amusing\r\ninstance of this occurs under the year 1722, when the Librarian craved\r\npayment for making with his own hand certain new hand-lists, &c., but was\r\nrefused. However, he carried on his claim from year to year until it was\r\nadmitted to the amount of £5 15_s._ 6_d._ in 1725. And as the funds were\r\ninsufficient to defray in this way the extra cost of cataloguing such a\r\ncollection as Rawlinson's, hence, doubtless, came the neglect which it\r\nexperienced. Such work was so clearly understood to form no part of the\r\nLibrarians' regular duties, that Rawlinson says, in a letter to Owen,\r\nApr. 15, 1751 (MS. C. 989), 'I think large benefactors should pay the\r\nexpense of entries into the Bodleian, as their books are useless till so\r\nentered.'\r\n\r\n[229] It was chiefly from these that the two volumes published in 1841\r\nunder the title of _Life, Journals, and Correspondence of S. Pepys_ were\r\ncompiled. Unfortunately the editor, or his copyist, appears to have been\r\nsometimes unable to read the MSS., and at other times very careless; his\r\nbook therefore abounds with errors. The following is one of the worst,\r\nas it libels the memory of a statesman who deserved better treatment:\r\nSir R. Southwell is represented as saying in a letter to Pepys (vol. i.\r\np. 282) that he has lost his health 'by sitting many years at the\r\n_sack_-bottle,' whereas the poor man had lost it by sitting many years\r\n'at the _inck_-bottle.' A line or two farther on, Southwell's occupation\r\nwith 'some care and much sorrow,' is changed into 'love, care and much\r\nsorrow.' Certain '_Novelles_,' or newspapers, which Mr. Hill sends to\r\nPepys are explained (vol. ii. p. 135) to have been the _Novellæ_ of\r\nJustinian! Throughout the book proper names are frequently made to\r\nbecome anything but proper to their owners.\r\n\r\n[230] Letter from Rawlinson to T. Rawlins, Jan. 25, 1749/50; Ballard MS.\r\nii. 115.\r\n\r\n[231] The same volume (now A. 139^b) also contains Monmouth's\r\nacknowledgment, written and signed by himself on the day of his\r\nexecution, that Charles II had declared that he was never married to his\r\nmother; witnessed by Bishops Turner and Ken, together with Tenison and\r\nHooper. This is now exhibited in the glass case at the entrance to the\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\n[232] In his delight at his new purchase, Rawlinson seems to have\r\nexaggerated the interest of these volumes.\r\n\r\n[233] Letter to T. Rawlins, Feb. 24, 1742/3; Ballard MS. ii. 78.\r\n\r\n[234] To the same; _Ibid._ 59.\r\n\r\n[235] Gough, _Brit. Topogr._ i. 370, 345.\r\n\r\n[236] Letter, June 24, 1741; Ballard MS. ii. 59.\r\n\r\n[237] Including some letters from Ken while Chaplain to Princess Mary.\r\nThese papers of Compton are in class C.\r\n\r\n[238] For the description of the contents of three of the Irish volumes,\r\nthe author was indebted to an experienced Irish scholar, Standish Hayes\r\nO'Grady, Esq.\r\n\r\n[239] A volume of collections by him relating to the early versions of\r\nthe Bible was bought in 1858 for five guineas.\r\n\r\n[240] Ballard MS. ii. 87.\r\n\r\n[241] One curious volume is described by Sir F. Madden in his preface to\r\n_Syr Gawayne_, printed by the Roxburghe Club in 1839.\r\n\r\n[242] With relation to these Rawlinson says, in a letter dated Feb. 25,\r\n1736-7, that he had bought, about two years since, some of Ashmole's\r\npapers from his heirs, including some of Dugdale's (Ballard MS. ii. 11).\r\n\r\n[243] For Parish Registers, see under 1821.\r\n\r\n[244] Two MS. volumes of the Relations of Venetian Residents in various\r\ncountries were given to the Library by Will. Gent, in 1600, and Sir\r\nRich. Spencer, in 1603.\r\n\r\n[245] From this library Rawlinson also obtained some French editions of\r\nthe _Horæ_, printed on vellum.\r\n\r\n[246] Ballard MS. ii. 41.\r\n\r\n[247] The clock, still in use in the Library, made by Robinson in\r\nGracechurch Street, was one of the items comprised in this codicil,\r\nwhere it is described as a 'table clock,' then in the custody of Mr.\r\nJohn King, a bookseller, in Moorfields.\r\n\r\n[248] These were bought, 'very cheap,' at Mrs. Kennon's sale, Feb. 24,\r\n1755, by a dealer named Angel Carmey, who sold them to Rawlinson for £10\r\n10_s._ Carmey's letter conveying his offer of sale is preserved in\r\nRawlinson's copy of the sale catalogue.\r\n\r\n[249] It does not appear, however, that this sum was ever paid.\r\n\r\n[250] A curious, and probably unique, little 'Almanacke for XII yere,\r\nafter the latytude of Oxenforde,' printed in 48^o (measuring two and\r\na-half inches by one and three-quarters), by Wynkyn de Worde, 'in the\r\nfletestrete,' in 1508, was presented by David Laing, LL.D., the eminent\r\nLibrarian to the Writers to the Signet, Edinburgh, in 1842. The Library\r\nalso possesses two copies of a sheet Almanack, by Simon Heuringius, for\r\n1551, printed by John Turck, at London; and other almanacs for 1564,\r\n1567, and 1569. A volume containing five almanacs for the year 1589 was\r\nbought in 1857.\r\n\r\n[251] With the same perverse eccentricity he ordered that the recipients\r\nof his endowments for the Keepership of the Ashmolean Museum and the\r\nProfessorship of Anglo-Saxon, should be unmarried (in the former case\r\nonly M.A. or B.C.L.), not a native of Scotland, Ireland, or the\r\nPlantations, nor a son of such native, nor, in the case of the Museum,\r\neven educated in Scotland, and not a member of either the Royal Society\r\nor the Society of Antiquaries.\r\n\r\n[252] Autobiographical memoirs by Foucault, extending to 1719, were\r\npublished under the editorship of F. Baudry, 4^o. Paris, 1862, in the\r\nFrench Government series of _Documents inédits sur l'Histoire de\r\nFrance_. The editor remarks in the preface (p. xli.), 'On ignore en\r\nquelles mains la bibliothèque de Foucault passa après sa mort [1721]. Le\r\nP. Le Long nous apprend seulement qu'elle fut vendue, et probablement\r\ndispersée.'\r\n\r\n[253] A record of his birth and baptism is entered in a family register\r\nkept by his father on the fly-leaves of a splendid copy of the folio\r\nPrayer-Book of 1662. He was the second son; born in Covent Garden, Apr.\r\n7, 1687; bapt. Apr. 21, by Dr. Patrick, the sponsors being Major-Gen.\r\nWerden, Sir Peter Apsley and the Countess of Bath. Prince George of\r\nDenmark was one of the sponsors to his elder brother, George. He had\r\nalso a sister, Martha.\r\n\r\n[254] Amongst these is a large collection of MS. news-letters written\r\nfrom various places abroad about the years 1637-1642; one of these,\r\ncontaining particulars of movements of the Swedish and Imperialist\r\narmies, is printed, as a specimen, in _Letters by Eminent Persons_,\r\n1813, vol. i. pp. 15-17.\r\n\r\n[255] References to many particulars relative to Thoresby, Bishop\r\nGibson, White Kennett and Hickes (with a few others) are given in J.\r\nNichols' notes to the _Letters of Archbp. Nicolson_ (2 vols. 1809), an\r\ninteresting and varied biographical miscellany, but which is guilty of\r\nthe capital crime of omitting an index.\r\n\r\n[256] This ought, apparently, to have reached the Library much sooner,\r\nthrough the hands of Dr. Charlett; since it has the following\r\ninscription on the fly-leaf: 'Given by the Hon^ble. S^r. Edmund Warcup\r\n(being all writ w^th his own hand at y^e Isle of Wight at y^e Treaty)\r\nto the Public Library in Oxford, to be placed there when I thought\r\nfitting.\r\n\r\n                                      'AR. CHARLETT.\r\n\r\n  'Univ. Coll.\r\n  Nov. 25, 97.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1756.\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel Johnson presented the account of Zachariah Williams' attempt\r\nto ascertain the longitude at sea, which he had published under\r\nWilliams' name in the preceding year; and, as Warton noted[257], he\r\nentered it with his own hand in the Library Catalogue. The entry is\r\nstill to be seen, with a memorandum of its being in Johnson's hand, in\r\nan interleaved, and now disused, copy of the Catalogue of 1738.\r\n\r\n[257] Boswell's _Life of Johnson_, edit. 1835, vol. ii. p. 54.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1759.\r\n\r\nAbove forty Syriac, Greek and Arabic MSS. are recorded in the Registers\r\nto have been presented by Henry Dawkins, Esq., of Standlynch, Wilts,\r\nwho had collected them while travelling in the East with Robert Wood,\r\nwhose works on Baalbec and Palmyra he presented at the same time. There\r\nare now _sixty_ MSS. in Syriac alone which pass under the name of\r\nDawkins, some of which are of great age and value. They are described in\r\nDr. R. Payne Smith's Catalogue of the Syriac MSS. Mr. Dawkins died in\r\nLondon, June 19, 1814, aged eighty-six.\r\n\r\nSwedenborg's _Arcana Cœlestia_, published anonymously, in 8 vols.\r\nwere sent 'by the author, unknown.' The same donor, still unknown, sent\r\nin 1766 _Selecti Dionys. Halicarn. tractatus_.\r\n\r\nIn this year and in 1761 published music began to be received from\r\nStationers' Hall, and to be entered in the Register. It remained piled\r\nup in cupboards until about twenty-three years ago, when it was all\r\ndisinterred and carefully arranged by Rev. H. E. Havergal, M.A., then\r\nChaplain of New Coll. and Ch. Ch., and an assistant in the Library (now\r\nVicar of Cople, Beds.), and bound in some 300 or 400 volumes. Since that\r\ntime two further series of musical volumes have been arranged and bound.\r\n\r\nA meagre list of the pictures, &c., in the Picture Gallery and Library\r\nwas printed by the Janitor (or Under-janitor), N. Bull, and 'sold by him\r\nat the Picture Gallery.' It fills twelve duodecimo pages. A new edition,\r\n'with additions and amendments,' including the pictures in the Ashmolean\r\nMuseum, was issued by him in 1762, in sixteen octavo pages. This was, as\r\nit seems, the first list that had been issued since Hearne printed his\r\noriginal Catalogue in his _Letter containing an Account of some\r\nAntiquities between Windsor and Oxford_. A list, equally meagre with\r\nBull's, was published by W. Cowderoy, Janitor, in 1806. He was succeeded\r\nin office (before 1825) by ---- Lenthall; on whom followed the present\r\nJanitor, J. Norris, appointed in 1835. By him a new Catalogue, enlarged\r\nwith biographical notices, was issued, filling sixty pages; which was\r\nreissued, with a few alterations, in 1847, when such of the pictures as\r\nwere not portraits had been removed to the new Randolph Gallery. As all\r\nthe portraits were a few years ago distinctly labelled, but few copies\r\nof the Catalogue have, consequently, been since sold, and no new edition\r\nhas appeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1760.\r\n\r\nThe MSS. of the eminent antiquary, Browne Willis, who died on Feb. 5, in\r\nthis year, came to the Library by his bequest. They were received from\r\nhis executor, Dr. Eyre, on April 24. There are altogether fifty-nine\r\nvolumes in folio, forty-eight in quarto, and five in octavo, consisting\r\nchiefly of Willis' own collections for his various works, with much\r\ncorrespondence intermingled and a few older historical papers. There is\r\nmuch of value for general ecclesiastical topography and biography,\r\nbesides his large collections for the county of Bucks, and special\r\nvolumes relating to the four Welsh Cathedrals. He desired in his will\r\nthat the books should be placed in the Picture Gallery, 'next to those\r\nof my friend Bishop Tanner;' both collections have since been removed to\r\na room on the floor below, but the presses which contain them still\r\nadjoin each other. Many of his letters are to be found among Ballard's\r\nand Rawlinson's papers, and show throughout both the warm interest which\r\nhe took in ecclesiastical renovation and religious work generally, but\r\nparticularly in the state of the Church in Wales, and the continual\r\nefforts which he made to rouse slothful and negligent dignitaries to a\r\nsense of their duties and responsibilities. The restoration of the\r\nruined and desolate Cathedral at Llandaff was an object especially dear\r\nto him. By his will, which was dated Dec. 20, 1741, he bequeathed to the\r\nUniversity, besides his MSS., all his numerous silver, brass, copper and\r\npewter coins, and also his gold coins, if purchased at the rate of £4\r\nper oz., as the best return he could make for the many favours he\r\nacknowledged to have been conferred on him and on his grandfather, Dr.\r\nThomas Willis, Professor of Natural Philosophy. This latter provision of\r\nhis will was at once carried into execution; in the following year the\r\nUniversity purchased one hundred and sixty-seven gold coins for £150 at\r\n£4 4_s._ per oz., and two more in 1743 for £8 5_s._ His other coins were\r\ngiven by him in the years 1739, 1740, 1741, 1747 and 1750; and by a\r\ncodicil to his will dated Feb. 5, 1742, he desired that the whole\r\ncollection should be annually visited on the Feast of St. Frideswide\r\n(Oct. 19), which day he had himself been wont annually to celebrate in\r\nOxford. His first gift to the Library was in the year 1720, when he gave\r\nten valuable MSS., chiefly historical (now placed among the general\r\n_Bodley_ Series), together with his grandfather's portrait.\r\n\r\nA bequest of £70, towards the purchase of an orrery, was received from\r\nRev. Jos. Parsons, M.A., of Merton College.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1761.\r\n\r\nKennicott's collations of Hebrew Biblical MSS., made during the years\r\n1759-60, were received from him on Dec. 17, in this year, according to\r\nan entry in the Register. But all his MSS., collations, correspondence,\r\nand miscellaneous books (including one in Zend, upon cloth), were\r\nsubsequently deposited in the Radcliffe Library, whence they were\r\nremoved, in 1862, together with the other contents of that collection,\r\nto the place of their present deposit, the New Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1762.\r\n\r\nThe west, or Selden, end of the Library was re-floored at a cost of £66.\r\nUnchaining of those books which hitherto, on account of their\r\naccessibility to all comers, were fastened to their shelves, appears to\r\nhave been commenced in this year.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1763.\r\n\r\nThe Janitor, Rev. John Bilstone, M.A., was deprived of his office by Dr.\r\nOwen, the Librarian, on account of his neglecting to perform his duties\r\nin person. An action for arrears of salary was subsequently brought by\r\nBilstone against Owen[258]. He died Feb. 13, 1767, at which time he held\r\nthree livings, besides his Chaplaincy of All Souls' College.\r\n\r\n[258] 'See papers in _Files_, 1763; Archiv.' (MS. note in Dr. P. Bliss'\r\n_Collectanea_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1764.\r\n\r\nThe _Editio princeps_ of Homer, Florence, 1488, was bought for £6 6_s._\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1768.\r\n\r\nH. Owen, the Librarian, and Principal of Jesus College, died in March of\r\nthis year, and was buried in his College Chapel. In his room was elected\r\nthe Rev. John Price, B.D., of Jesus College, 'after a severe contest\r\nwith Mr. Cleaver, of Brasenose, afterwards head of that College and\r\nBishop of St. Asaph, who used to say that he was indebted to Mr. Price\r\nfor his mitre, for had he obtained the Bodleian he should have there\r\ncontinued, instead of becoming tutor in a noble family, and so placed in\r\nthe road to advancement. In this election the votes were equal, and Mr.\r\nPrice, being senior, was nominated by the Vice-Chancellor[259].' Price\r\nappears to have been employed in the Library as early as the year 1760,\r\nwhen a payment of £8 8_s._ was made to him; in 1766 he signs, together\r\nwith Owen and Thomas Parker, an account of books received from\r\nStationers' Hall.\r\n\r\n[259] Note by Dr. Bliss in the edition of Wood's _Life_ published, in\r\n1848, by the Eccl. Hist. Soc. p. 88.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1770.\r\n\r\nThe Library was largely enriched with books which were then modern, in\r\nwhich it appears to have been very deficient, by the legacy of the\r\nlibrary of Rev. Charles Godwyn, M.A., Fellow of Balliol College. The\r\ncollection, which is still in the main kept undivided (although a few\r\nfolio and quarto volumes are placed in the general class marked _Art._),\r\nconsists chiefly of works in English and general history, civil and\r\necclesiastical, published in the eighteenth century, and includes\r\nbesides the later Benedictine editions of the Fathers. There is also a\r\nseries of theological and literary pamphlets; to which have been added\r\nof late years upwards of 2400 volumes, of all dates and on all subjects,\r\nwhich are now all alike numbered, for convenience sake, in connection\r\nwith Godwyn's own. The residue of his property, after payment of all\r\nclaims and bequests, formed a further portion of his legacy; and the\r\ninterest upon £1050 which accrued from this source, still forms part of\r\nthe annual income of the Library.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1771.\r\n\r\nA payment of £2 12_s._ 6_d._ was made in this year (or rather, at the\r\nclose of 1770) to a glass-painter, named Brooks, for one of the coats of\r\narms in the great east window.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1775.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four Oriental MSS. and bundles of papers which had been found in\r\nthe study of Rev. Dr. Thos. Hunt, Reg. Prof. of Hebrew, who died in the\r\npreceding year, were given by various persons.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1776.\r\n\r\nLord North, the Chancellor of the University, presented to the Library\r\nthe observations made by Dr. James Bradley, while Astronomer Royal, at\r\nGreenwich, 1750-62. These had been given to him by Mr. John Peach,\r\nson-in-law to Dr. Bradley, while a suit was pending between the Board of\r\nLongitude on behalf of the Crown and Mr. Peach respecting his right to\r\ntheir possession. The claim of the Crown had been first made in 1765, on\r\nthe ground that they were the papers drawn up by Bradley in discharge of\r\nhis public and official duties, but the executor, Mr. Sam. Peach,\r\nrefused to resign them except for some valuable consideration. But after\r\nhis death, his son, Mr. John Peach, who married Dr. Bradley's daughter,\r\npresented them to Lord North, with the understanding that the latter\r\nshould give them to the University, on condition that they should be\r\nforthwith printed. They were, consequently, immediately put into the\r\nhands of Dr. Hornsby, the Savilian Professor of Astronomy, for\r\npublication; but the work progressed very slowly, in consequence of his\r\nill-health, and a remonstrant correspondence ensued between the Board of\r\nLongitude, the Royal Society, and the University, which was printed by\r\nthe Board, together with a statement of the whole case and of the steps\r\ntaken by them for the recovery of the papers, in 1795. Several letters\r\nfrom Sir Joseph Banks, as President of the Royal Society, to Price the\r\nLibrarian, in 1785, on the slow progress of the work, are preserved in a\r\nvolume of MS. Letters to Librarians, recently bound up by Mr. Coxe. The\r\nfirst volume at length appeared in 1798, in folio, and the second,\r\nedited by Prof. A. Robertson, in 1805, with an appendix of observations\r\nmade by Bradley's successor, Rev. Nath. Bliss, and his assistant, Mr.\r\nCharles Green, to March, 1765, which had been purchased by the Board of\r\nLongitude, and were presented by them to the University, in March, 1804.\r\nSome further remains of Dr. Bradley were, after Dr. Hornsby's death,\r\nfound among the papers of the latter, and these (having been restored to\r\nthe University by his family, on application, about 1829) were published\r\nin 1831, under the editorship of Prof. S. P. Rigaud, in one vol.\r\nquarto, entitled _Miscellaneous Works and Correspondence of Rev. J.\r\nBradley_. In 1861, a fresh application for the return of the\r\nObservations was made to the University, by Mr. Airy, the Astronomer\r\nRoyal, on the ground that they were the only volumes wanting in the\r\nseries preserved at Greenwich, and that they were frequently needed\r\nthere for reference. By a vote of Convocation, on May 2, this\r\napplication was acceded to, and thirteen volumes of Observations were\r\nreturned to what was certainly their legitimate place of deposit. Some\r\nmiscellaneous papers, making about thirty parcels, still remain in the\r\nLibrary.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1778.\r\n\r\n_Carte's MSS._ See 1753.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1780.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 22, a Statute was passed which imposed an annual fee of four\r\nshillings[260] on all persons entitled to read in the Library and all\r\nwho had exceeded four years from matriculation, as well as assigned to\r\nthe Library a share of the matriculation fees. The preamble of the\r\nStatute alleges that the funds of the Library were so insufficient for\r\ntheir purpose that of works of importance daily published throughout the\r\nworld 'vix unus et alter publicis sumptibus adscribi possit.' The\r\nStatute also provided for the holding of regular meetings by the\r\nCurators, and the issuing of an annual Catalogue of the books purchased\r\nduring the year, with their prices, together with a statement of\r\naccounts. The commencement of the annual printed purchase-catalogues\r\ndates in consequence from this year.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Thos. Burgess, afterwards the Bishop of St. David's and\r\nSalisbury, to Mr. Tyrwhitt, the editor of Chaucer, dated Corp. Chr.\r\nColl., Nov. 16, 1779, the plan for increasing the funds of the Library,\r\nestablished by this Statute, is mentioned as a scheme 'much talked of,'\r\nthe defects of the Library being such as 'we are now astonished should\r\nhave been of so long continuance[261].' A paper in behalf of the\r\nproposal was circulated among Members of Convocation, upon a copy of\r\nwhich, preserved by Dr. Bliss with his set of the annual Catalogues, the\r\nlatter has noted that it was written by Sir William Scott, afterwards\r\nLord Stowell.\r\n\r\nThe exquisite portrait of Sir Kenelm Digby, supposed to be by Vandyke,\r\nwas given by Edw. Stanley, Esq. It is now in the Picture Gallery; and,\r\nhaving recently been cleaned and covered with plate-glass, appears once\r\nmore in all the freshness of its original perfection[262].\r\n\r\nThe Sub-librarian at this time was John Walters, an undergraduate\r\nScholar of Jesus College. He published in this year a small volume of\r\n_Poems_ ('written before the age of nineteen'), the chief portion of\r\nwhich consists of a description of the Library, written with a warm\r\nadmiration of his subject, and by no means destitute of poetic feeling.\r\nIt numbers 1188 lines, and is illustrated with some well-selected notes.\r\nIn 1782, when B.A. and still Scholar of his College, he published\r\n_Specimens of Welsh Poetry in English verse, with some Original Pieces\r\nand Notes_. He took the degree of M.A. in 1784, and died in 1791[263].\r\nWe learn from a MS. note in a copy of his _Poems_, presented to the\r\nLibrary by the present Principal of Jesus College, that he was the son\r\nof John Walters, Rector of Llandough (author of a Welsh Dictionary,\r\n1794), by Hannah his wife, and that he was baptized there, July 9, 1760.\r\n\r\n[260] By the Statute passed in 1813, and by that on Fees passed in 1855,\r\nan annual payment of _eight_ shillings was ordered to be made to the\r\nLibrary out of the total sum (now £1 6_s._) paid by each graduate whose\r\nname is on the University Books. But these individual fees, varying with\r\nthe numbers on the Books, were consolidated, in 1861 in one fixed annual\r\nsum, from the University Chest, of £2800.\r\n\r\n[261] Note by Dr. Bliss, in his MS. _Collectanea_, bequeathed by him to\r\nRev. H. O. Coxe.\r\n\r\n[262] Another portrait of Sir Kenelm, which hangs in the Library, was\r\ngiven, in 1692, by Mr. William Pate, a woollen-draper of London. To this\r\nMr. Pate, Thos. Brown dedicated, in 1710, as 'his honest friend,' his\r\ntranslation from the French of _Memoirs of the Present State of the\r\nCourt and Councils of Spain_.\r\n\r\n[263] Nichols' _Lit. Anecd._ viii. 122.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1785.\r\n\r\nGeorge III and Queen Charlotte visited the Library, from Nuneham, on\r\nOct. 13. Price, the Librarian, was in attendance, and kissed hands.\r\n\r\nSeveral Assistants, whose names are not perpetuated in the Library\r\nrecords, are found perpetuated by the inscriptions written by successive\r\ngenerations on the old oak staircases which run from their studies to\r\nthe galleries above. In June of this year, Thomas Whiting, of Jesus\r\nCollege (B.A. also in this year), does in this way transmit the memory\r\nof his service to posterity. E. Thomas (_qu._ Evan Thomas, of All Souls'\r\nCollege, B.A., 1793?) does the same in 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1787.\r\n\r\nOn May 31, the Reader in Chemistry, Thomas Beddoes, M.D., of Pembroke\r\nCollege, issued a printed Memorial to the Curators 'concerning the state\r\nof the Bodleian Library, and the conduct of the Principal Librarian.'\r\nThe utmost laxity appears from this statement to have prevailed with\r\nregard to attendance, and to the hours of opening the Library; the\r\nLibrarian was always absent on Saturdays and Mondays, as on those days\r\nhe was occupied in journeys to and from a curacy eleven miles distant,\r\nwhich he held together with a living more remote; and the Library which\r\nshould then in summer have been opened at eight was found unopened\r\nbetween nine and ten, and unopened also after University sermons. The\r\nLibrarian is charged besides with having discouraged readers by neglect\r\nand incivility, with being very careless in regard to the value and\r\ncondition of books purchased by the Library[264], and with having but\r\nlittle knowledge of foreign publications. An anecdote is related\r\n(amongst others) of his lending _Cook's Voyages_, which had been\r\npresented by King Geo. III, to the Rector of Lincoln College, and\r\ntelling him that the longer he kept it the better, 'for if it was known\r\nto be in the Library, he (Mr. Price) should be perpetually plagued with\r\nenquiries after it[265].' In consequence of these complaints, the\r\nCurators, in 1788, prepared on their part a new form of Statute, while\r\nthe Heads of Houses prepared another. This separate action led to a\r\npaper war between the two bodies, in which the Regius Professors of\r\nDivinity, Law, Medicine, Hebrew and Greek, (Randolph, Vansittart,\r\nVivian, Blayney and Jackson) appeared on the Curators' side of the\r\nquestion, and, as the Hebdomadal Board persisted in pressing their own\r\nscheme, they at length (with the exception of Blayney) adopted the\r\nstrong step, on the day when the rival plan was proposed in Convocation\r\n(June 23, 1788), of formally protesting before a notary public against\r\nthis violation of their privileges. The consequence was that the Statute\r\nwas withdrawn, and the proposal for a new code abandoned by both\r\nparties. The chief points of difference were, that the Curators objected\r\nto the proposal being put forward as 'cum consensu Curatorum' instead of\r\n'ex relatione Curatorum,' to the increase of the Librarian's stipend to\r\n£150, to the appointment of two Sub-librarians instead of one, and to\r\nthe leaving the appointment of these in the hands of the Librarian (in\r\naccordance with Bodley's own Statute) instead of assigning it to the\r\nCurators.\r\n\r\nEleven Arabic and Persian MSS. were given by Turner Camac, Esq., co.\r\nDown.\r\n\r\nA first part of a Catalogue of the Oriental MSS., comprehending those in\r\nHebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Æthiopic, Arabic, Persian, Turkish and Coptic,\r\nwas issued in this year, in folio. It was compiled by John Uri, a\r\nHungarian, who had studied Oriental literature under Schultens, at\r\nLeyden, and who was recommended for this purpose to Archbp. Secker, by\r\nSir Joseph Yorke, then Ambassador in the Netherlands. Many years were\r\noccupied in the preparation of this volume, as Uri appears to have\r\ncommenced his work in 1766, his signature occurring in the 'Registrum\r\nadmissorum' under Feb. 17, in that year[266]. Sixty closely-printed\r\nfolio pages of corrections and additions are, however, supplied by Dr.\r\nPusey, in the second part of the Catalogue, which he completed after Dr.\r\nNicoll's death and published in 1835. In his preface to this part, Dr.\r\nPusey remarks that Uri frequently copied with carelessness; and that the\r\nwhole series of Arabic MSS. was found to need re-examination from the\r\ndiscovery that all kinds of cheats and impositions had been played upon\r\nall the purchasers of Eastern MSS., Pococke alone excepted, by the\r\ncunning sellers with whom they dealt, particularly in the passing off of\r\nsupposititious works for genuine[267]. And upon carrying out this\r\nre-examination, the following was found to be the result:--\r\n\r\n    'Varias errorum formas deprehendi, titulis nunc charta coopertis,\r\n    nunc atramento oblitis, nunc cultro pæne abrasis; auctorum porro\r\n    nominibus paullulum immutatis quo notiora quædam referrent; numeris\r\n    etiam, quibus singula volumina signata sunt, permutatis, quo quis\r\n    opus imperfectum pro integro habeat, paginis denique pauculis operi\r\n    alieno a fronte assutis.'\r\n\r\n[264] Among other instances the purchase (in 1784) of Sir John Hill's\r\n_Vegetable System_, at the cost of £140, is mentioned.\r\n\r\n[265] It appears incidentally, from this pamphlet, that three o'clock\r\nwas the dinner-hour at almost every College at that time.\r\n\r\n[266] He died suddenly at his lodgings in Oxford, Oct. 18, 1796, aged\r\nupwards of seventy (_Gent. Magaz._, vol. lxvi. p. 884.)\r\n\r\n[267] The late Dr. Simonides was evidently by no means the first in his\r\nart, although probably _facile princeps_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1789.\r\n\r\nThe Anatomy School, on the Library staircase, was fitted up in this year\r\nas a room for receiving the Greek and Biblical MSS., and\r\nfifteenth-century editions of classics. In 1794 it was ordered that it\r\nshould be distinguished by the name of the _Auctarium_, a name which it\r\nstill retains. Mr. John Thomas, of Wadham College, (B.A. 1790, M.A.\r\n1793) was employed in 1790 in arranging the room and making a list of\r\nits contents.\r\n\r\nMany early editions of the classics were purchased at the sale of the\r\nlibrary of Mapheo Pinelli, at Venice. To enable these purchases to be\r\nmade, the Curators made a public application for loans, to which a\r\nliberal response was returned, as noted under the following year.\r\n\r\nThe increased attention which began to be paid to the Library about this\r\ntime is thus mentioned in a letter from Mr. Dan. Prince, the Oxford\r\nbookseller:--\r\n\r\n    'Our Bodleian Library is putting into good order. It has been\r\n    already one year in hand. Some one, two or three of the Curators\r\n    work at it daily, and several assistants. The revenue from the tax\r\n    on the Members of the University is about £460 per annum, which has\r\n    existed 12 years. This has increased the Library so much that it\r\n    must be attended to, and a new Catalogue put in hand. They have\r\n    lately bought all the expensive foreign publications. A young man of\r\n    this place is about making a Catalogue of all the singular books in\r\n    this place, in the College libraries as well as the Bodleian.... We\r\n    have a young man in this place, his name is Curtis, who was an\r\n    apprentice to me, who has hitherto only dealt in books of\r\n    curiosities, in which he is greatly skilled, superior in many\r\n    respects to De Bure, Ames, or his continuator. He has been employed\r\n    five or six years in the Bodleian Library, and since at Wadham,\r\n    Queen's and Balliol. He purposes to publish a Catalogue of little or\r\n    not known books in Oxford, particularly in Merton, Balliol and\r\n    Oriel[268].'\r\n\r\n[268] Nichols, _Lit. Anecd._ iii. 699, 701.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1790.\r\n\r\nA very large number of _Editiones principes_ and other early-printed\r\nbooks were purchased at the sale at Amsterdam of the library of P. A.\r\nCrevenna. The first entire Hebrew Bible, printed at Soncino in 1488, was\r\npurchased for £43 15_s._; and Fust and Schoeffer's first _dated_ Latin\r\nBible (Mentz, 1462) for £127 15_s._ To enable the Library to make the\r\npurchases of this and the preceding year, benefactions were received to\r\nthe amount of nearly £200, and upwards of £1550 were lent by various\r\nbodies and individuals. The repayment of the loans was completed in\r\n1795.\r\n\r\n£120 were received for duplicates sold to Messrs. Chapman and King.\r\nOther small receipts from similar sales are found under the years 1793,\r\n1794 and 1804.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1791.\r\n\r\nFrom this year onwards until 1803, inclusive, the name of Mr. Edward\r\nLewton, of Wadham College (B.A. 1792, M.A. 1794), is found as that of an\r\nAssistant employed upon the Catalogues. Further benefactions to the\r\namount of £232, for the purpose of aiding the purchase of early-printed\r\nbooks, were received in this year. The list of all the donors is printed\r\nin Gutch's edition of Wood's _History and Antiquities_, vol. ii. part ii.\r\np. 949.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1792.\r\n\r\nThe collections of notes and various readings made by Joseph Torelli, of\r\nVerona, in preparation for his edition of Archimedes, were deposited in\r\nthe Library, (F. _infra_, 2. _Auct._). They were given to the University\r\nafter his death (in 1781) by his executor, Albert Albertini, partly\r\nthrough the instrumentality of Mr. John Strange, envoy to Venice, upon\r\ncondition that the University undertook the publication. The work was\r\nconsequently printed at the University Press, and issued in a handsome\r\nfolio volume in this year.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1793.\r\n\r\nA magnificent copy of Gutenberg's Bible, not dated, but supposed to have\r\nbeen printed about 1455, fresh and clean as if it had just come from the\r\nhands of the men of the New Craft, carefully set at their work, was\r\nbought for the very small sum of £100. It is exhibited in the first\r\nglass case in the Library. This is the edition often called the\r\n_Mazarine Bible_, from the circumstance that the first copy which\r\nobtained notice was found in the Mazarine Library at Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1794.\r\n\r\nThe _Editio princeps_ of the Bible in German, printed by Eggesteyn about\r\n1466, was bought for £50.\r\n\r\nA chronological Catalogue, in two folio volumes, of a very large and\r\nvaluable collection of pamphlets (which had hitherto been kept in the\r\nRadcliffe Library), extending from 1603 to 1740, was made in 1793-4, by\r\nMr. Abel Lendon, of Ch. Ch. (B.A. 1795, M.A. 1798.)\r\n\r\nMr. Rich. S. Skillerne, of All Souls' (B.A. 1796, M.A. 1800), was\r\nemployed in the Library.\r\n\r\nWith a view to the formation of a new Catalogue, the Curators at the end\r\nof the annual list made a first application for returns of such books\r\nexisting in the several College libraries as were not in the Bodleian,\r\nin order thereby to accomplish what would be a most useful work, and is\r\nstill a great _desideratum_, a General Catalogue of all the books in\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1795.\r\n\r\nA brief list (filling sixty small octavo pages) was printed at the\r\nClarendon Press, of the _Editiones principes_, the fifteenth-century\r\nbooks, and the Aldines, then in the Library. The name of the compiler\r\ndoes not appear. It is entitled, 'Notitia editionum quoad libros Hebr.,\r\nGr. et Lat. quæ vel primariæ, vel sæc. xv. impressæ, vel Aldinæ, in\r\nBibliotheca Bodleiana adservantur.'\r\n\r\nFour cabinets of English coins were presented by Thomas Knight, Esq., of\r\nGodmersham, Kent. Among them was an ornament (now exhibited in the glass\r\ncase near the Library door) said to have been worn by John Hampden when\r\nhe fell at Chalgrove Field[269]. It consists of a plain cornelian set in\r\nsilver, with the following couplet engraved on the rim:--\r\n\r\n    'Against my King I do not fight,\r\n    But for my King and kingdom's right.'\r\n\r\nThe Curators renewed a request, made ineffectually some time before,\r\nthat the several Colleges would make out returns for the Library of all\r\nsuch books in their own collections as did not appear in the Bodl.\r\nCatalogue. In the year 1801 they acknowledged the receipt of such lists\r\nfrom Magdalen[270], Balliol, Exeter, and Jesus; Oriel sent a list\r\nsubsequently (in 1808?); but these were all that were ever forwarded.\r\n\r\n[269] Lord Nugent, in his _Memorials of Hampden_, erroneously mentions\r\nthis as being preserved in the Ashmolean Museum. He also repeats two\r\nmistaken readings first given in Miss Seward's _Anecdotes_, iv. 358 (a\r\nvolume dedicated to Price, the Librarian), where a small woodcut of the\r\nornament is given.\r\n\r\n[270] A complete Catalogue of the Library of this College, compiled by\r\nRev. E. M. Macfarlane, M.A., of Linc. Coll., was issued by the College,\r\nin three handsomely-printed quarto volumes, in 1860-62. The books of all\r\nwriters belonging to the College, are entered separately in an Appendix\r\nin vol. iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1796.\r\n\r\nA few _incunabula_ and Aldines were purchased at Göttingen.\r\n\r\nThe annual list of donations was, for the first time, printed in this\r\nyear. It does not include, however, a large gift which was partly\r\nreceived now, the presentation having been made in the year preceding.\r\nIt was the gift by Rev. Dr. Nath. Bridges of the MSS. collections made\r\nby Mr. John Bridges for his _History of Northamptonshire_. They number\r\nthirty-seven volumes in folio, eight in quarto, and one in octavo; and\r\nconsist chiefly of extracts from Public Records and from the Episcopal\r\nRegisters of Lincoln, the volumes in quarto containing Church notes for\r\nthe several parishes. Some account of them is given in Mr. Whalley's\r\npreface to vol. i. of Bridges' _History_, published in 1791.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1798.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished historical antiquary, Sir Henry Ellis, D.C.L., was\r\nappointed in this year, by his friend the Librarian, to be one of the\r\nAssistant-librarians; commencing thus, while still an undergraduate\r\nFellow of St. John's (which College he had entered in 1796) the studies\r\nand pursuits which eventually led to the post, so long and honourably\r\nheld by him, of Principal Librarian and Head of the British Museum. In a\r\nletter with which the author of this volume was recently favoured by him\r\n('_jam senior, sed mente virens_,') Sir Henry mentions that the Rev.\r\nHenry Hervey Baber, of All Souls' College (B.A. 1799, M.A. 1805), who\r\nwas afterwards one of his colleagues in the Museum, and who now (_ætat._\r\n92) is Vicar of Stretham, in the Isle of Ely, was his senior in the\r\nBodleian, as Coadjutor-under-librarian, by a year or two. In consequence\r\nof the insufficiency of the statutable staff, the place of the one\r\nUnder-librarian was at this time, and subsequently, shared by two\r\noccupants. In 1800 Sir H. Ellis signed, in conjunction with Mr. Price,\r\nthe return printed in the first Record Commission Report relative to the\r\nHistorical MSS. possessed by the Library.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1799.\r\n\r\nSome MSS. papers of the eminent French divine, Pet. Franc. le Courayer,\r\nwere bequeathed by Rev. Bertrand Russel. Courayer's portrait,\r\nrepresenting him in his alb, was given by Courayer himself in 1769.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1800.\r\n\r\nThe chief purchases in this year were of English and foreign maps,\r\npurchases which were continued in 1802 and 1804. For Maraldi's and\r\nCassini's _Atlas of France_, in 2 vols., no less than £104 was paid! The\r\ninterest now taken in French politics was also shown by the purchase of\r\na set of the _Moniteur_ from 1789, which was bought for £66.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1801.\r\n\r\nA large and valuable collection of MS. and printed music was received,\r\nat the beginning of this year or the close of the preceding, by the\r\nbequest of Rev. Osborne Wight, M.A., formerly a Fellow of New College,\r\nwho died Feb. 6, 1800[271]. The MSS. number about 190 volumes. They\r\ncontain anthems, &c., by Arnold, Bishop, Blow, Boyce, Croft, Greene,\r\nPurcell, &c; a large number of the works of Drs. Philip and William\r\nHayes; with very many madrigals and motetts by early Italian and English\r\ncomposers, and some of Handel's compositions. The printed volumes\r\nconsist chiefly of the original folio editions of Handel, Arnold's and\r\nBoyce's collections, and the works of Playford, Purcell, Croft, Greene,\r\nand other English composers. A MS. Catalogue of the whole was made by\r\nRev. H. E. Havergal, M.A., about 1846, when the collection was put in\r\norder. The Library also possesses full band and voice parts of several\r\nof the odes and other compositions by both Philip and William Hayes.\r\nBesides his books Mr. Wight also bequeathed £100 in the 3 per cents. 'to\r\ndefray expenses.' Few additions have been made in the class of old music\r\nsince his gift. Some rare sets of madrigals have been purchased,\r\nspecially, in 1856, those of Morley, Watson, Weelkes, Wilbye, and Yonge,\r\nfor £24 14_s._ 6_d._; Mr. Vincent Novello gave, in 1849, MSS. of\r\nHandel's _Te Deum in D_, and Greene's anthem, 'Ponder my words,' and in\r\nthe following year a MS. of part of the ancient Gregorian Mass, 'De\r\nAngelis,' harmonized by Sam. Wesley, in 1812; the Professor of Music,\r\nSir F. Ouseley, Bart., gave some French _Cantates_ in 1856; and two or\r\nthree volumes have been added by the present writer.\r\n\r\n[271] A short memoir of this gentleman is given in _Gent. Magaz._ for\r\n1800, p. 1212, where it is said that 'he was eminently skilled in the\r\npractice and composition of music, and was probably excelled by no one,\r\nwhether _dilettante_ or professor, as a sightsman in vocal execution.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1803.\r\n\r\nAn Arabic MS., in seven volumes, written in 1764-5, and containing what\r\nis rarely met with, a complete collection of the Thousand and One Tales\r\nof the _Arabian Nights' Entertainments_, was bought from Capt. Jonathan\r\nScott for £50. Mr. Scott published, in 1811, an edition of the Tales, in\r\nsix volumes, in which this MS. is described. He obtained it from Dr.\r\nWhite, the Professor of Hebrew and Arabic at Oxford, who had bought it\r\nat the sale of the library of Edward Wortley Montague, by whom it had\r\nbeen brought from the East. It is noticed in Ouseley's _Oriental\r\nCollections_, vol. ii. p. 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1805.\r\n\r\nIn this year the last volume (numbered 142) of Dr. Holmes' Collations of\r\nMSS. of the Septuagint-Version, was deposited in the Library. This great\r\nand important work had been commenced in the year 1789; it was intended\r\nto embrace collations of all the known MSS. of the Greek text, as well\r\nas of Oriental versions; and for seventeen years, by the help of liberal\r\nsubscriptions, in spite of the difficulties interposed by the\r\ncontinental wars, the collection of the various readings from MSS. in\r\nlibraries throughout Europe was carried on. And each year's work was, on\r\nits completion, deposited in the Bodleian. During this period, annual\r\naccounts were published of the progress of the work, which possess both\r\ncritical and bibliographical interest; and the results of the whole are\r\nseen in the fine edition printed at the Clarendon Press, in five vols.,\r\nfolio, 1808-1827.\r\n\r\nThe MSS. of the distinguished classical scholar, James Philip D'Orville,\r\nwho died at Amsterdam, Sept. 14, 1751, were bought for £1025. After the\r\npurchase was completed, a question arose whether the University of\r\nLeyden were not, by the terms of his will, entitled to them after the\r\ndeath of his son, but it was ascertained that this provision was only\r\nmade in case his son did not reach manhood. The collection numbers about\r\n570 volumes, containing many valuable Greek and Latin Classics, together\r\nwith numerous collations of texts, and annotated printed copies.\r\nThirty-four volumes contain correspondence (autograph and in copy) of\r\nIs. Vossius, Heinsius, Cuper, Paolo Sarpi, Beverland, and the letters\r\naddressed to D'Orville by all the great scholars of his time. And\r\nthirty-eight volumes, in folio and quarto, contain _Adversaria_ of\r\nScipio and Alberic Gentilis. There are also six Turkish and Arabic MSS.\r\nThe gem of the collection is a quarto MS. of _Euclid_, containing 387\r\nleaves, which was written, 'χειρι Στεφανου κληρικου,' A.M.\r\n6397 = A.D. 889. It contains a memorandum by one Arethas of Patras, that\r\nhe bought the book for four (or, most probably, fourteen,) _nummi_. A\r\nCatalogue of the MSS., compiled anonymously by Dr. (then Mr.) Gaisford,\r\nwas printed in quarto, in 1806. D'Orville's signature occurs in the\r\nAdmission-book as having been admitted to read on Aug. 18, 1718.\r\n\r\nA form of new Statute was put out on March 28, to be proposed to\r\nConvocation in May; but it appears to have been withdrawn, as no fresh\r\nStatutes were actually enacted until 1813. The staff was proposed to be\r\nincreased to the number which was adopted in the latter year, but with\r\nsmaller salaries; and the Library was to be open from nine to three,\r\nthroughout the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1806.\r\n\r\nFifty pounds were paid for some 'Tibetan MSS.' of Capt. Samuel Turner,\r\nE.I.C.S., who had been sent by Warren Hastings, on a mission to the\r\nGrand Llama, in 1785. Of this mission he published an account, in a\r\nquarto volume, in 1800. His MSS. consist chiefly of nine bundles of\r\npapers and letters in the Persian and Tartar languages, written in the\r\nlast century, together with a few Chinese printed books. Capt. Turner\r\ndied Jan. 2, 1802; but as one of his sisters was married to Prof. White,\r\nit was probably through him that the papers were now purchased.\r\n\r\nA beautiful copy of the _Koran_ which had been in the library of Tippoo\r\nSahib (now exhibited in the glass case near the door) was presented,\r\ntogether with another MS. from the same collection, by the East India\r\nCompany. Dibdin speaks of it as a work 'upon which caligraphy seems to\r\nhave exhausted all its powers of intricacy and splendour,' and adds the\r\nfollowing description:--\r\n\r\n    'The preservation of it is perfect, and the beauty of the binding,\r\n    especially of the interior ornaments, is quite surprising. The first\r\n    few leaves of the text are highly ornamented, without figures,\r\n    chiefly in red and blue. The latter leaves are more ornamental; they\r\n    are even gorgeous, curious and minute. The generality of the leaves\r\n    have two star-like ornaments in the margin, out of the border. Upon\r\n    the whole this is an exquisite treasure, in its way[272].'\r\n\r\nThe _Catholicon_ of J. de Janua, printed at Mentz, in 1460, was bought\r\nfor £63.\r\n\r\nThe following singular memorandum, relating to this year, is preserved\r\non a small paper:--\r\n\r\n    'Oxford, Aug. 29, 1806. Borrowed this day, of the Rev. the Bodleian\r\n    Librarian, the picture given to the Library by Mr. Peters, which I\r\n    promise to return upon demand.\r\n\r\n                                          'JOSEPH WHITE.\r\n\r\n  '_Mem._ Not returned, June 24, 1807.\r\n              'Nor as yet, Oct., 1808. J. P. (_i.e._ J. Price).\r\n              'And never to be ret^d.' (added at some later period.)\r\n\r\nThis picture must have been the portrait of Professor White himself,\r\nwhich was painted and presented by Rev. Will. Peters, R.A., in\r\n1785[273]. It has never been restored.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of Saturday, April 19, probably but little after nine\r\no'clock, the statutable time for the opening of the Library, some\r\nzealous student stood at the door, but could get no further. No one\r\nappeared to give him entrance; the Librarian himself never came on a\r\nSaturday, and probably his Assistants were not scrupulous in\r\npunctuality; at any rate, the expectant student stood and expected in\r\nvain. But ere he departed, he denounced a 'Woe' which perpetuates to\r\nthis day the memory of his vain expectancy; he affixed to the door the\r\nfollowing text, which doubtless seemed to him naturally suggested:\r\n'Ουαι ὑμιν, ὁτι ηρατε την κλειδα της γνωσεως; αυτοι ουκ εισηλθετε, και\r\nτους εισερχομενους εκωλυσατε.' The paper is now preserved over the door\r\nof one of the Sub-librarians' studies, with this note added: 'Affixed to\r\nthe outer door of the Library by some _scavant inconnu_, April 19,\r\n1806.'\r\n\r\n[272] _Bibliogr. Decam._ iii. 472.\r\n\r\n[273] Gutch's _Wood_, II. ii. 979.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1807.\r\n\r\nA list of the books printed during the year at the University Press is\r\nadded to the annual account. This was not repeated.\r\n\r\nA copy of the _Speculum Christiani_, printed by Will. de Machlinia, was\r\ngiven by Rev. A. H. Matthews, of Jesus College.\r\n\r\nAmongst the names of Assistants, written by them, _more Anglico_, on the\r\nwood-work of their studies, occurs the name of 'Rob. Fr. Walker, New\r\nColl., Dec. 1807.' Mr. Walker (B.A. 1811, M.A. 1813) was subsequently\r\nCurate of Purleigh, Essex, where he died in 1854. He was known as the\r\ntranslator of a _Life of Bengel_, and other works, from the German. A\r\nmemoir of him was published by Rev. T. Pyne, from which the account\r\ngiven by Dr. Bloxam in his _Register of Magd. Coll._ ii. 115-117, was\r\ntaken. In 1810, John Woodcock (B.A. 1817, M.A. 1818, Chaplain of New\r\nCollege) appears, from the same evidence as Mr. Walker, to have been an\r\nAssistant, one Will. John Lennox in 1808, and John Jones, (Ch. Ch.? B.A.\r\n1808, M.A. 1815), in 1809.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1808.\r\n\r\nThe Latin Bible printed by Ulric Zell, at Cologne, in two volumes, about\r\n1470, was bought for £47 5_s._ The Bible printed at Rome, by Sweynheym\r\nand Pannartz, in 1471, had been bought, in 1804, for £35; and in 1826 a\r\nStrasburgh edition, printed with Mentelin's types, without date, was\r\nobtained for £94 10_s._\r\n\r\nA set of the Oxford Almanacks, from the commencement in 1674 to this\r\nyear, was given by a frequent donor, Alderman Fletcher[274].\r\n\r\n[274] A limited number of copies of the engravings of these Almanacks,\r\nfrom the original plates which remain in the University Press, were\r\nre-issued in 1867, under the superintendence of Rev. John Griffiths,\r\nM.A.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1809.\r\n\r\nThe death of the eminent topographer and antiquary, Richard Gough, on\r\nFeb. 20, 1809[275], brought into operation the bequest made to the\r\nLibrary in his will, dated ten years previously. This consisted of all\r\nhis topographical collections, together with all his books relating to\r\nSaxon and Northern literature, 'for the use of the Saxon Professor,' his\r\nmaps and engravings, and all the copper-plates used in the illustration\r\nof the various works published by himself. The transmission of this vast\r\ncollection was accomplished by Mr. J. Nichols, the executor, in the\r\ncourse of the year; and some of his correspondence on the subject is\r\nprinted in his _Illustrations of Literary History_, vol. v. pp. 556-561.\r\nThe collection (which numbers upwards of 3700 volumes) was placed in the\r\nroom formerly the Civil Law School, that room having been assigned to\r\nthe Library a few years previously, and fitted up (at a cost of about\r\n£675) for the reception of various historical collections. In the same\r\nroom are now the Carte, Dodsworth, Tanner, Willis, Junius, and portion\r\nof the Rawlinson, manuscripts, with other smaller collections; the name\r\nproposed to be given to it, and by which it was designated in Gough's\r\nwill, was 'The Antiquaries' Closet.' Gough's library consists, firstly,\r\nof a large series of maps[276] and topographical prints and drawings, in\r\nelephant-folio volumes; of this a very brief outline-list is given in\r\nthe printed catalogue, but a full list in detail exists in MS[277].\r\nSecondly, of printed books and MSS., arranged under the heads of General\r\nTopography, Ecclesiastical Topography[278], Natural History, the several\r\nCounties (with London, Westminster, and Southwark) in order[279], Wales,\r\nIslands, Scotland, and Ireland. Thirdly, of 227 works connected with\r\nAnglo-Saxon literature and that of the Scandinavian races generally.\r\nFourthly, of an extremely large and valuable series of printed\r\nService-books of the English Church before the Reformation, together\r\nwith a few MSS., chiefly _Horæ_. The value of this series may be\r\ngathered from the following statement of the Missals, Breviaries,\r\nManuals, Processionals, and Hours, which it comprises, besides which\r\nthere are Graduals, Psalters, Hymns, Primers, &c.\r\n\r\n  _Missals_,  Salisbury use,                                     30\r\n      \"       York       \"                                        4\r\n      \"       Rouen      \"                                        1\r\n      \"       Roman      \"                                        3\r\n      \"       'pro sacerdotibus in Anglia, &c. itinerantibus.'    1\r\n  _Breviaries_ and _Portiforia_, Salisbury use,                  18\r\n      \"                 \"        York       \"                     2\r\n      \"                 \"        Hereford   \"                     1[280]\r\n  _Manuals_, Salisbury use,                                      10\r\n      \"      York (MS.) \"                                         1\r\n  _Processionals_, Salisbury use,                                10\r\n      \"            York       \"                                   1\r\n  _Hours_, Salisbury use,                                        24\r\n      \"    Roman      \" (besides several MSS.)                    1\r\n\r\nOf several of these books there are more than single copies.\r\n\r\nA fifth division of Gough's library consists of sixteen large folio\r\nvolumes of coloured drawings of monuments in churches of France, chiefly\r\nat Paris, in Normandy, Valois, Champagne, Burgundy and Brie, and at\r\nBeauvais, Chartres, Vendosme and Noyon. They form part of a large\r\ncollection extending through the whole of France, which was made by M.\r\nGagnières, tutor to the sons of the Grand Dauphin, and given by him to\r\nLouis XIV in 1711. Of this collection, now preserved in the Imperial\r\nLibrary, twenty-five volumes were lost amid the troubles of the French\r\nRevolution, between 1785 and 1801; but in what way, out of the\r\ntwenty-five, these sixteen came into Gough's hands, has not been clearly\r\nascertained. The collection is of great value, as most of the monuments\r\nwere defaced or destroyed by the revolutionary mobs. Gough's volumes\r\ncontain about 2000 drawings, of the whole of which facsimiles were made\r\nin 1860 by M. Jules Frappaz, by direction of the French Minister of\r\nPublic Instruction, (who made application for the purpose, through Mr.\r\nJ. H. Parker, in 1859) for the purpose of so far supplying the\r\ndeficiency in the series at Paris[281].\r\n\r\nThe copy of the _British Topography_, which Gough had prepared for a\r\nthird edition (of which a considerable part of vol. i. had been printed,\r\nbut was burned in the disastrous fire at Mr. Nichols' printing-office in\r\nFeb., 1808,) was bought by the Curators of Mr. Nichols in 1812 for\r\n£150[282]. It has been recently bound in four very thick volumes. A\r\nfifth volume contains the proof-sheets of that portion of vol. i. which\r\nhad been printed, extending to _Cheshire_, p. 446. The collections for\r\nthe first edition make three volumes.\r\n\r\nBy Gough's bequest the Library became also possessed (as mentioned\r\nabove) of the very valuable copper-plates which illustrated his\r\n_Sepulchral Monuments_, and other works. In 1811, one hundred guineas\r\nwere paid to Basire, the engraver, for cleaning and arranging 380 of\r\nthese plates. Amongst these was the actual brass effigy of one of the\r\nWingfield family in the fifteenth century, from Letheringham Church,\r\nSuffolk, of which an engraving is found in the _Monuments_. The brass is\r\nnow exhibited in the glass case of miscellaneous objects of curiosity in\r\nthe Picture Gallery.\r\n\r\nThe Catalogue of the collection was issued from the University Press, in\r\na quarto volume, in 1814. It was chiefly compiled by Dr. Bandinel, to\r\nwhom fifty guineas were paid for it, in 1813; but Dr. Bliss has\r\nnoted[283] that the first 136 pages were prepared by himself. In the\r\n_Bibliographical Decameron_ (vol. i. p. xcv.) Dibdin has made honourable\r\nmention of the 'perseverance, energy, and exactness' with which he found\r\nDr. Bandinel working on a very hot day in the year 1812, in the\r\narrangement of the collection, 'in an oaken-floored room, light,\r\nspacious, and dry.'\r\n\r\nSome account and survey-books, belonging to University and Magdalen\r\nColleges, which came to the Library among Gough's MSS., were restored by\r\nvote of Convocation on March 9, 1814.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe MSS. which the well-known traveller, Rev. Edw. Dan. Clarke, LL.D.,\r\nhad collected during his journeys through a large part of Europe and\r\nAsia, were purchased from him in this year for £1000. A first portion of\r\na Catalogue, comprising descriptions of fifty volumes, of which fifteen\r\nare in Latin, two in French (Alain Chartier, one being the printed edit.\r\nof 1526), and the rest in Greek, was published in 1812, in quarto, by\r\nDr. Gaisford, who printed in full some inedited Scholia on Plato and on\r\nthe Poems of Gregory Nazianzen. A second part of the Catalogue,\r\ncontaining a description of forty-five volumes in Arabic, Persian, and\r\nÆthiopic, was issued by Dr. Nicoll, in 1814. The special feature in the\r\ncollection is a MS. of Plato's Dialogues, from which the Scholia are\r\nprinted in the Catalogue, written (on 418 vellum quarto leaves) by a\r\nscribe named John (who styles himself _Calligraphus_) in the year 896,\r\nfor Arethas, a deacon of Patras, for the sum of thirteen Byzantine\r\n_nummi_. The D'Orville MS. of Euclid was also written for this Arethas\r\n(see p. 208).\r\n\r\n[275] A very full memoir of him is to be found in the _Lit. Anecd._ vol.\r\nvi. pp. 262-343, and 613-626. His miscellaneous library was sold by\r\nauction in 1810. Two drawings in sepia, by F. Lewis, of his house at\r\nEnfield, were bought in 1861.\r\n\r\n[276] One of these is a very curious manuscript map of England and\r\nScotland, executed in the fourteenth century, which now hangs, framed\r\nand glazed, in the eastern wing of the Library. It was bought by Gough\r\nat the sale of the MSS. of Mr. Thomas Martin, of Palgrave, Suffolk, in\r\n1774. A facsimile (engraved by Basire) and a description are given in\r\nthe _British Topography_, 1780, vol. i. pp. 76-85. Another object of\r\ninterest among the maps is a piece of tapestry, in three fragments,\r\ncontaining portions of the counties of Hereford, Salop, Staffordshire,\r\nWorcestershire, Warwickshire, Gloucestershire, Middlesex, &c. They are\r\nsaid by Gough, in a MS. note in his collections for a third edition of\r\nhis _Topography_, to be parts of the three great maps of the Midland\r\nCounties, formerly at Mr. Sheldon's house at Weston, Long Compton,\r\nWarwickshire, which are the earliest specimens of tapestry weaving in\r\nEngland, the art having been introduced by William Sheldon, who died in\r\n1570. They are described in vol. ii. of the _Topography_, pp. 309-310.\r\nThey were bought by Lord Orford at a sale at Weston for £30, and\r\npresented by him to Earl Harcourt, whose successor, Archbishop Harcourt,\r\ngave them to the Museum at York (where they now are) in 1827. In\r\nMurray's _Handbook for Yorkshire_, they are said to have been made in\r\n1579. One guinea was given by Gough for his fragments.\r\n\r\n[277] This list was drawn up about 1844-6 by Mr. Fred. Oct. Garlick,\r\nthen an assistant in the Library (afterwards of Ch. Ch., B.A., deceased\r\n1851).\r\n\r\n[278] Mr. A. Chalmers gave, in 1813, the second volume of a copy of\r\nWharton's _Anglia Sacra_, with MSS. notes by White Kennett, of which the\r\nfirst volume was in this division of Gough's library. But both volumes\r\nhad been bought by Gough for £1 1_s._ at the sale of J. West's library\r\nin 1773, at which sale he procured, besides, several other books with\r\nKennett's notes. There are also volumes with MSS. notes by Baker (the\r\n'socius ejectus') Cole, Rowe Mores, and other well-known antiquaries.\r\n\r\n[279] The County Histories are in many instances enriched with various\r\nnotes and papers in print and MS. The Berkshire MSS. have been increased\r\nin the present year (1868) by the addition of the collections of the\r\nlate Will. Nelson Clarke, D.C.L., of Ch. Ch., author of the _History of\r\nthe Hundred of Wanting_ (4^o. 1824), which have been presented to the\r\nLibrary by Mr. Coxe, to whom they were given by his cousin, the\r\ncollector, when the latter relinquished the idea of writing a history of\r\nBerks. They consist of a Parochial History of the county, transcripts of\r\nHeralds' Visitations and of early records, and miscellaneous note-books\r\nand papers.\r\n\r\n[280] The splendid and, as it is believed, unique vellum copy of the\r\n_Hereford Missal_ ('ad usum eccl. Helfordensis,' fol. Rouen, 1502) which\r\nthe Library possesses, came to it from Rawlinson among the books of T.\r\nHearne, to whom it had been given by Charles Eyston, Esq., of East\r\nHendred, Berks. (Hearne's pref. to Camden's _Annales Eliz._ 1. xxvii.)\r\nThis Hereford volume is described, together with many of Gough's books,\r\nin a book by Ed. Frère, entitled _Des Livres de Liturgie des Eglises\r\nd'Angleterre imprimés à Rouen dans les_ xv. _et_ xvi. _Siècles_, 8^o\r\nRouen, 1867.\r\n\r\n[281] See _Gent. Magaz._ for 1860, p. 406.\r\n\r\n[282] So in the Library Register of accounts. Nichols (_Lit. Hist._ vol.\r\nv. p. 559) says £100.\r\n\r\n[283] In his MS. _Collectanea_, in the possession of Rev. H. O. Coxe.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1810.\r\n\r\nIn March, the Prince Regent forwarded to the University four rolls of\r\npapyrus, brought from Herculaneum, burned to a state resembling\r\ncharcoal, together with engravings of rolls hitherto deciphered, and\r\nmany facsimile copies, in pencil, of inedited rolls. A committee was\r\nappointed from the Curators of the Library and the Delegates of the\r\nPress, at the beginning of the year 1811, to have the charge of this\r\ngift, and £500 were granted towards publication. Two volumes of\r\nlithographed facsimiles were in consequence published at the Clarendon\r\nPress, in 1824-5. Some further selections from these papers have\r\nrecently been published by a German scholar, Dr. Th. Gompertz.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 15, it was resolved in Convocation to restore to the Chancery at\r\nDurham, on the application of the Bishop of Durham, the MS. Register of\r\nRichard Kellow, Bishop of Durham, 1310-16, containing also a portion of\r\nthe Register of Rich. Bury, 1338-42, which had come to the Library among\r\nRawlinson's collections, and was the only volume wanting at Durham in an\r\nunbroken series of Episcopal Registers, of which this was the first. It\r\nwas borrowed in 1639/40, as it appeared, by an agent of the Marquis of\r\nNewcastle, for the purpose of production in some law-suit affecting his\r\nproperty; remained through the Civil War in his hands; fell subsequently\r\ninto those of the Earl of Oxford, and was bought by Rawlinson from\r\nOsborne the bookseller, in whose sale-catalogue of the Harleian Library\r\nin 1743 it was numbered 20734.\r\n\r\nIn this year Dr. Philip Bliss, the editor of Wood's _Athenæ_, appears to\r\nhave entered the Library as an assistant, the entries in the register of\r\nbooks received from Stationers' Hall being partly made by him, in his\r\nvery clear and neat hand. In 1812 he drew up short catalogues of the St.\r\nAmand MSS. and of a portion of the Rawlinson collection (the _Poetry_,\r\nthe _Letters_, and the commencement of the _Miscell._) for which a\r\npayment was made to him of £21. He afterwards quitted the Library for\r\nthe British Museum, but returned in 1822, as Sub-librarian, for a short\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHis life-long friend, Dr. Bandinel, entered the Library also in this\r\nyear. To him, for a list of a further portion of the Rawlinson MSS., £26\r\n5_s._ were paid in 1812.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1811.\r\n\r\nOnly eighteen books were purchased in this year! The list, scantly\r\nfilling one page, is consequently the _minimum_ in the series of annual\r\ncatalogues.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1813.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Price, B.D., the Librarian, died on Aug. 11, aged\r\nseventy-nine, after forty-five years of office. A short biographical\r\nnotice is given in the _Gentleman's Magazine_ for Oct., 1813, p. 400,\r\nand a fuller account, together with many letters, and an engraved\r\nportrait, with facsimile signature, (from a sketch taken in 1798, by\r\nRev. H. H. Baber), in vols. v. and vi. of Nichols' _Illustrations of the\r\nLit. Hist. of the 18th Century_. The following character of him with\r\nregard to his discharge of his official duties is there given (vi. 471),\r\nwhich in some respects forms a strong contrast to the representation of\r\nProf. Beddoes in the year 1787 (_see_ p. 197). 'In the faithful\r\ndischarge of his public duties in the University, he acquitted himself\r\nwith the highest credit, and deservedly conciliated the esteem of others\r\nby his readiness to communicate information from the rich literary\r\nstores over which he presided, and of which he was a most jealous and\r\nwatchful guardian. He was, from long habit, so completely attached to\r\nthe Library, that he considered every acquisition made to its contents\r\nas a personal favour conferred upon himself.' It was chiefly owing to\r\nhis assiduous attention to Mr. Gough and his frequent correspondence\r\nwith him, that the Library was enriched with the bequest of the latter's\r\nsplendid topographical collections. But there is not much existing to\r\ntell of personal work in the Library during his long tenure of office,\r\nand the fact that nothing was done till near the close of that period\r\ntowards arranging and cataloguing the Rawlinson MSS., seems to prove\r\nthat there was no great activity in the Library under his management.\r\nThis is corroborated also by the wonderful difference which is\r\nimmediately seen in the annual catalogue of purchases; the Catalogue for\r\n1813 grows at once from the two folio pages of the preceding year to\r\nseventeen, while the sum expended becomes £725 in the place of\r\n£261[284]. And the list of books forwarded from Stationers' Hall, and\r\nhitherto received only twice yearly, at Lady-day and Michaelmas, becomes\r\nin 1815 largely increased, while in the year 1822 the number of yearly\r\nparcels is increased to eight. At the present time, as for a long time\r\npast, books are received monthly.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Bulkeley Bandinel, M.A. (D.D. in 1823), of New College, was\r\nelected Librarian by Convocation on Aug. 25. He had been appointed\r\nSub-librarian in 1810, by Mr. Price, who was his godfather; and for a\r\nshort time previously had been a Chaplain in the Royal Navy, having\r\nserved with Adm. Sir James Saumarez on board the 'Victory,' in the\r\nBaltic, in 1808.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of a new Librarian was followed by the enacting of a new\r\nStatute, passed by Convocation on Dec. 2, which provided for the\r\nincrease of the Librarian's stipend to £400, exclusive of his share of\r\nfees from degrees; for the appointment of two Sub-librarians, instead of\r\none, and these not under the degree of M.A., with salaries of £150; of\r\ntwo assistants, Bachelors of Arts or undergraduates, with salaries of\r\n£50; and of the Janitor, with a salary of £20. An additional annual\r\ngrant, calculated at £680, equal to that which resulted from the\r\nprovision made by the Statute of 1780, and to be paid, like that, out of\r\nthe yearly fees of graduates whose names are on the books, was\r\nsanctioned, with the triple object of providing for this enlarged staff,\r\nfor the commencement of a new Catalogue, and for repairs hitherto\r\ndefrayed out of the general University funds. The state of the roof and\r\nceiling were said to be such as to justify an apprehension that they\r\nmust at no distant period be entirely constructed anew; happily this\r\nreconstruction was only carried out with respect to the Picture Gallery,\r\nand the roof of the Library remains as a precious relic still.\r\n\r\nThe hours at which the Library should be open, were fixed to be from 9\r\nto 4 in the summer half-year, and 10 to 3 in the winter; the only change\r\nsince made has been the enacting, in 1867, that nine o'clock shall be\r\nthe invariable hour of opening on all ordinary days[285].\r\n\r\nThe junior assistants in the Library in this year were Mr. Francis\r\nThurland, of New College (B.A. 1812, M.A. 1814), and Mr. Sam. Slack, of\r\nCh. Ch. (B.A. 1813, M.A. 1816).\r\n\r\n[284] Among the purchases is a set of the _Gentleman's Magazine_ to the\r\nyear 1810 for £52 10_s._\r\n\r\n[285] This alteration of hours had been previously proposed in a Statute\r\nwhich was to have been submitted to Convocation on Dec. 11, 1812, but\r\nwhich appears to have been withdrawn ere the day came, probably because\r\nthis larger measure of revision of the old Statutes was already in\r\ncontemplation. A blank is left in the Convocation Book under that date,\r\nby the then Registrar, Mr. Gutch; and his successor, Dr. Bliss, has\r\nadded a pencil-note to the effect that he supposes from the blank not\r\nbeing filled up, that the proposal was previously abandoned. The Statute\r\nof 1769 had required that the Library should be open in summer from 8 to\r\n2 and from 3 to 5, but it was stated in some remarks which accompanied\r\nthe proposed enactment that these injunctions had 'long been disregarded\r\nin practice,' and that the Library had been open throughout the year\r\nfrom nine to three o'clock. But it was added that 'experience' had\r\n'shewn that there is no occasion for requiring the attendance of the\r\nLibrarians before ten in the winter season.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1814.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of the Rev. Henry Cotton, M.A., then Student of Ch. Ch.,\r\nnow the venerable Archdeacon of Cashel, as Sub-librarian, was approved\r\nin Convocation on March 9. Of the interest which he took in his work, of\r\nhis qualifications for it, and of the advantages which the\r\nbibliographical world has derived from it, his _Typographical Gazetteer_\r\nand _List of Editions of the English Bible_, afford abundant\r\ntestimony[286]. He remained in the Library eight years, quitting it when\r\nhis friend Dr. Laurence, on his appointment to the Archbishopric of\r\nCashel, carried him with himself to Ireland.\r\n\r\nDuring his continuance in the Library, a descriptive Catalogue of the\r\n_Editiones principes_ and _Incunabula_ was projected by him and Dr.\r\nBandinel; but only one specimen page in octavo was printed, of which a\r\ncopy has been preserved by Dr. Bliss, with his set of the annual\r\ncatalogues.\r\n\r\nAlex. Nicoll, M.A., of Balliol College (a native of Aberdeen), was\r\nappointed Sub-librarian at the early age of twenty-one; the nomination\r\nwas approved in Convocation on April 27. He at once devoted himself to\r\nthe study of Oriental languages, and became a proficient in Hebrew,\r\nArabic, Persian, Syriac, Æthiopic, and Sanscrit. His facility in\r\nacquiring languages must have been truly marvellous, for, in addition\r\nto these Eastern tongues, and although his death occurred at the early\r\nage of thirty-six, it is said that 'he spoke and wrote with ease and\r\naccuracy, French, Italian, German, Danish, Swedish, and Romaic.' In 1822\r\nhe was, much to his own surprise, appointed, at the age of twenty-nine,\r\nto the Regius Professorship of Hebrew, by Lord Liverpool, on the\r\nrecommendation of Dr. Laurence, who vacated that post in consequence of\r\nhis appointment to the see of Cashel. Nicoll held the Professorship for\r\nonly seven years, dying on Sept. 24, 1828. The records of his labours in\r\nthe Bodleian are found in the Catalogue of Clarke's Oriental MSS.\r\nnoticed under the year 1809, and in his second part of the General\r\nCatalogue of Oriental MSS., published in 1821, _q. v._\r\n\r\nThe total receipts and expenditure of the Library were for the first\r\ntime fully stated in the annual accounts. Hitherto the practice had been\r\nto omit the Bodley endowment and the Crewe benefaction, &c., which were\r\ndevoted to salaries, repairs and other ordinary expenses (including also\r\nthe occasional purchase of MSS.), and only to report the amount received\r\nfrom University fees and expended on printed books and incidental\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\n[286] In a clever and amusing little squib of four pages, which he\r\nprinted anonymously in 1819, and which is preserved in the\r\nLibrary-collection of University papers, professing to be a 'Syllabus'\r\nof treatises on academic matters, to be printed at the University Press\r\nin not more than thirty vols., elephant quarto, Mr. Cotton satirized\r\nhimself and his colleagues, doubtless with the more readiness because\r\nwith no reason. '21. De Bibliothecario et ejus adjutoribus. _Captain._\r\nWhat are you about, Dick? _Dick._ Nothing, sir. _Captain._ Tom, what are\r\nyou doing? _Tom._ Helping Dick, sir.' Treatise 24 has for its title the\r\nfew but emphatic words, '_De Dodd_.' Lest some future delver in Oxford\r\nantiquities should be lost in a maze of conjectures as to the\r\npersonality and history of this worthy, so evidently then well known,\r\nlet it here be told that Dodd was the _Clerk of the Schools_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1815.\r\n\r\n_Cedunt arma togæ!_ The effect which the cessation of the war produced,\r\nin diverting to quiet academic channels the stream of youth which\r\nhitherto had flowed in the turbid currents of continental strife, is\r\nshown by the large increase of the Library receipts derived from\r\nmatriculation fees. These, which previously fell below (and often far\r\nbelow) £250, rose in 1814, on the first sign of peace, to £424, and in\r\nthis year, on its final establishment, to £633.\r\n\r\nIn January, Mr. John Calcott, of Lincoln College (B.A. 1814, M.A. 1816,\r\nB.D. 1825; Fellow of Linc.; deceased 1864) was appointed _Minister_ in\r\nthe room of Mr. Francis Thurland, of New College, resigned. Mr.\r\nCalcott, however, only held the office for one year, being succeeded, in\r\nFeb. 1816, by Mr. Sam. Fenton, of Jesus College (B.A. 1818, M.A., Ch.\r\nCh. 1821).\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1816.\r\n\r\nA very important MS., with relation to Scottish history, was placed in\r\nthe Library on Dec. 5, in this year. It is a transcript (from the\r\noriginals,) by Col. J. Hooke, agent in Scotland for James II[287], of\r\nall his political correspondence between the beginning of the year 1704\r\nand the end of 1707. It forms two folio volumes, but is unfinished, as\r\nthe second volume ends with the commencement of a letter from James\r\nOgilvie, of Boyn, to M. de Torcy, Dec. 26, 1707. A brief narrative of\r\nHooke's negotiations, which contains copies of a few of the letters here\r\ngiven, was published in France, in the French language, and a\r\ntranslation was printed in a small volume at Dublin in 1760; but the\r\ngreat mass of the correspondence is as yet inedited. The volumes came to\r\nthe Library in pursuance of a bequest from the Rev. J. Tickell, Rector\r\nof Gawsworth, Cheshire and East Mersea, Essex, who died at Wargrave,\r\nBerks, July 3, 1802. The bequest was to take effect upon the death of\r\nhis wife, which occurred towards the close of 1816[288].\r\n\r\nThe Curators reported, at the end of the annual list, that considerable\r\nprogress had been made towards the formation of a new general Catalogue.\r\nFurther progress was reported in the following year; in which year also\r\nDibdin[289] announced that the Catalogue would be finished, in four\r\nfolio volumes, by Messrs. Bandinel and Cotton under the superintendence\r\nof Professor Gaisford[290]. He adds, 'The Prince Regent hath\r\nmunificently given a considerable sum towards the completion of these\r\nglorious labours.' There is no record in the annual accounts of any such\r\ndonation; but in 1823 and 1824 payments amounting to £420 were made to\r\nthe Librarian, Sub-librarians, and Assistant, for their work on the new\r\nCatalogue[291], out of 'the Prince Regent's benefaction.' On the\r\nproposition of the Chancellor, Lord Grenville, in 1814, Mr. Vansittart,\r\nthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, had expressed his willingness to apply\r\nto Parliament for a grant of £5000 for the purpose; probably this idea\r\nwas abandoned for the more easily practicable one of a grant from the\r\nPrivy Purse.\r\n\r\nFour Greek MSS. were presented in this year by Rev. ---- Hall, Chaplain at\r\nLeghorn[292]; a copy of Lucan's _Pharsalia_, with MSS. collations by\r\nJoseph Addison, by the Warden of Merton College; and a large collection\r\nof books in Oriental literature, printed in Bengal, by the East India\r\nCompany.\r\n\r\n[287] Hooke in 1685 was one of the Chaplains attending Monmouth in his\r\nrebellion! _Lockhart Papers_, 1817, vol. i. p. 148.\r\n\r\n[288] _Gent. Magaz._ vol. lxxv. ii. 569.\r\n\r\n[289] _Bibliogr. Decam._ iii. 429.\r\n\r\n[290] Portions of the Letters A F and P which had been thus prepared\r\nwere subsequently printed, but the whole work was then for some years\r\nsuspended, and afterwards commenced _de novo_. And nearly thirty years\r\nelapsed before it was finally completed.\r\n\r\n[291] Previous grants amounting to £260, had been made in 1820.\r\n\r\n[292] Three of these are described in Mr. Coxe's Catalogue, cols.\r\n812-14.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1817.\r\n\r\nThe large Canonici collection of MSS. was obtained from Venice in this\r\nyear, for the sum of £5444, a purchase unprecedented in greatness in the\r\nhistory of the Library[293]. The collection was formed by Matheo Luigi\r\nCanonici, a Venetian Jesuit, who was born in 1727 and died in Sept. 1805\r\nor 1806. Indefatigable in his passion for antiquities, he first formed a\r\nMuseum of statues and of medals at Parma, but, in consequence of the\r\nJesuits being expelled from the State, this was sold to the government.\r\nHe then at Bologna set himself to collect religious objects of interest,\r\nand had succeeded to some extent, when the rector of his society\r\nobserved to him that such a collection was little suitable to a poor\r\nmonk, and he consequently disposed of it to a Roman prince. Finally, at\r\nVenice, he commenced the gathering of a library, in which it is said, as\r\none evidence of its extent, there were more than four thousand Bibles\r\nwritten in fifty-two languages[294].\r\n\r\nThe MSS. purchased by the Bodleian amount in number to about 2045.\r\nDibdin, almost immediately upon the acquisition, noticed it thus[295]:--\r\n\r\n    'They have recently acquired a very curious and valuable collection\r\n    of MSS., which formerly belonged to an ex-Jesuit Abbé, who intended\r\n    (had he lived to have seen the restoration of the order of the\r\n    Jesuits) to have presented them to the Jesuits' College at Venice.\r\n    Neither pains nor expense were spared among his brethren, in all\r\n    parts of the world, to make the collection, on that account, as\r\n    perfect as possible.'\r\n\r\nIn Greek there are 128 volumes, chiefly of the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies, with a few of earlier date, including two _Evangelistaria_\r\nassigned by Montfaucon to the ninth century. Of Latin classical authors\r\nand Mediæval poets there are 311 volumes; some of those of the former\r\nclass are of great age and value, notably a Virgil of the tenth century\r\n(No. 50). Ninety-three MSS. form the class of Latin Bibles; the finest\r\nof these are, one written in 1178 for the church of SS. Mary and Pancras\r\nin Ranshoven, and another, in five very large folio volumes, written and\r\nilluminated in France, in the years 1507-1511. Of Latin ecclesiastical\r\nwriters and Fathers there are 232 volumes; and of Latin miscellanies\r\n(chiefly in medicine, philosophy and science, theology, and _belles\r\nlettres_, with scarcely anything of an historical character), 576\r\nvolumes. Of all these classes a catalogue was published by Mr. Coxe in\r\n1854, forming part iii. of the new general Catalogue of MSS.\r\n\r\nAnother division consists of Liturgical books. In this class there are\r\nnow 400 volumes, but about 130 of these were added from the Rawlinson\r\ncollection. They consist chiefly of _Horæ_, Breviaries, Missals, and\r\nPsalters, with a few other service-books; most of those which belonged\r\nto Canonici being 'secundum usum Romanum.' No catalogue of this series\r\nhas, as yet, been made.\r\n\r\nA sixth division comprehends 300 Italian MSS. (including five in\r\nSpanish) of which a very elaborate catalogue was compiled, as a labour\r\nof love, by the Count Alessandro Mortara, during the years of his stay\r\nin Oxford[296]. His MS. was bought after his death from his executor the\r\nAbate Giuseppe Manuzzi, of Florence, for £201, in the year 1858; it was\r\nafterwards put to press under the care of the accomplished Italian\r\nscholar, and intimate friend of Count Mortara, Dr. H. Wellesley, the\r\nlate Principal of New Inn Hall, and appeared, with an Italian preface by\r\nhim giving some account of the whole collection, in one volume quarto\r\n(158 pages,) in 1864.\r\n\r\nThe last portion of the collection consists of 135 Oriental MSS.,\r\nchiefly valuable Hebrew books on vellum. One of these (No. 78) is a copy\r\nof Maimonides' Commentary on the Law, in fourteen books, which is dated\r\n1366. Seven of the Biblical volumes are noticed in De Rossi's _Variæ\r\nLectiones Veteris Testamenti_. The few Arabic MSS. are described in Dr.\r\nPusey's Continuation of Nicol's Catalogue.\r\n\r\nA curious story of the recovery, amidst these books, of some leaves\r\nbelonging to a printed vellum Bible already in the Library, will be\r\nfound related under the year 1750. A few other MSS. from Canonici's\r\nlibrary were sold by auction, with some from Saibante's, in London, in\r\n1821. And many relating to Italian and Venetian history, which were at\r\nfirst retained by one of the heirs, passed afterwards into the hands of\r\nthe Rev. Walter Sneyd, of Baginton, Warwickshire, their present\r\npossessor. A MS. volume of notices of the Canonici library, drawn up by\r\nSignor Lorenzi, of Venice, was bought by the Bodleian, in 1859, for ten\r\nguineas[297].\r\n\r\nA MS. of Suidas, of the fifteenth century, was purchased for £220 10_s._\r\nAnother acquisition was a French translation, made in 1417, by Laurens\r\nde Preme, of the _Ethics_, _Politics,_ &c., of Aristotle[298]. Some\r\nspecimens of the Javanese language were given by Capt. L. H. Davy.\r\n\r\nAmong printed books, the most noticeable purchase (besides the _Edd.\r\nPr._ of Livy, 1469, Lactantius, 1465, &c.) was that of a vellum copy of\r\nthe first edition of the Hebrew Pentateuch, printed at Bologna in 1482,\r\nfor £17 10_s._ Some sets of controversial and political tracts, with\r\nother books, which had belonged to Thomas Brande Hollis and Dr. John\r\nDisney, were bought at the sale of the library of the latter.\r\n\r\n[293] The money was raised by loans of £2000 from the Radcliffe Trustees\r\nand £3644 from the University Bankers. They were both repaid by the year\r\n1820.\r\n\r\n[294] De Backer's _Bibliothèque des écrivains de la comp. de Jésus_;\r\nquatr. série, p. 93. 8vo. Liège, 1858.\r\n\r\n[295] _Bibliogr. Decam._ iii. 429.\r\n\r\n[296] See under the year 1852.\r\n\r\n[297] The first MSS. of Dante which the Library possessed, came in the\r\nCanonici collection; they are in number fifteen. This fact is worth\r\nmentioning, on account of an extraordinary story told by Girolamo Gigli,\r\nin his _Vocabolario Cateriniano_, p. cciii. (a book the printing of\r\nwhich was commenced at Rome in 1717, but which was suppressed, by bull,\r\nbefore completion), that in the Bodleian Library at 'Osfolk,' there was\r\na MS. of the _Divina Commedia_, which, from being employed in enveloping\r\na consignment of cheese (and so imported into England by a mode of\r\nconveyance said to have been usually adopted by Florentine merchants,\r\nwith a view of spreading at once a knowledge of their luxuries and their\r\nliterature), had become so saturated with a caseous savour as to require\r\nthe constant guardianship of two traps to protect it from the voracity\r\nof mice. Hence, according to this marvellous travellers' story, the MS.\r\nwent by the name of _The Book of the Mousetrap_! (See _Notes and\r\nQueries_, i. 154.)\r\n\r\n[298] Bodl. MS. 965.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1818.\r\n\r\nA return was made to the House of Commons of such books received since\r\n1814, in pursuance of the Copyright Act, from Stationers' Hall, as it\r\nhad not been deemed necessary to place in the Library. The list is but a\r\ntrifling one, consisting chiefly of school-books and anonymous novels,\r\nwith music; but, nevertheless, it is sufficient to show the great need\r\nof caution in rejecting any books excepting such as are of the simplest\r\nelementary character, and the advantage of erring rather on the side of\r\ninclusiveness than exclusiveness. Miss Edgeworth's _Parents' Assistant_,\r\nMrs. H. More's _Sacred Dramas_, Mrs. Opie's _Simple Tales_, and an\r\nedition of _Ossian_, were all consigned to the limbo of 'rubbish.' But\r\nthe Cambridge Return (which is much more detailed than that from\r\nOxford[299]) shows a recklessness of rejection which speaks little for\r\nthe judgment of the Librarians for the time being. Besides school-books\r\nand music, a large number of pamphlets figure in the list, including\r\nsome by Chalmers and Cobbett; the _Theology_ includes Owen's _History of\r\nthe Bible Society_; the _History_ includes _Memoirs of Oliver Cromwell\r\nand his Children_; the _Poetry_, Byron's _Siege of Corinth_, L. Hunt's\r\n_Story of Rimini_, and Wordsworth's _Thanksgiving Ode_; and the\r\n_Novels_, [Peacock's] _Headlong Hall_, one by Mrs. Opie, and--_The\r\nAntiquary_! The far wiser plan is now carried out in the Bodleian of\r\nrejecting nothing; even the elementary works that do not need entering\r\nin the Catalogue, are so kept that access can be had to them at all\r\ntimes and examination made; and the music is from time to time sorted\r\nand bound. And this plan was commenced in the year of which we are\r\nwriting; for, (in consequence, of course, of this return being called\r\nfor by the House of Commons,) the Curators ordered, on May 27, that\r\n_all_ publications sent from Stationers' Hall should in future be\r\nentered and preserved.\r\n\r\nA very valuable and curious series of original editions of Latin and\r\nGerman tracts, issued by the German Reformers between 1518 and 1550, in\r\neighty-four volumes, was bought for £95 15_s._ Additions have been made\r\nto this collection at various times subsequently, so that now it\r\nprobably comprises as complete a gathering of these controversial\r\npublications, so easily lost or destroyed from their small extent and\r\noften ephemeral character, as can anywhere be found. A kindred\r\ncollection (although not of like value or interest) was obtained through\r\nthe gift by Mr. A. Müller, a well-known bookseller at Amsterdam, of a\r\nseries of tracts, in sixty-two volumes, and chiefly in the Dutch\r\nlanguage, on the controversy with the Remonstrants in 1618-19. A MS.\r\nCatalogue, by Mr. Müller, dated March 3, is kept in the Librarian's\r\nstudy. Besides the books, Mr. Müller gave a few coins, including one\r\nstruck on leather during the siege of Leyden in 1574, and some natural\r\ncuriosities, which latter are now preserved in the New Museum. A _black\r\nnegro baby_, preserved in spirits (!) has, however, unaccountably\r\ndisappeared; let us hope it was decently buried. Seventeen panes of\r\npainted glass, probably by disciples of Crabeth, who painted the windows\r\nin the Church of Gouda, also formed part of this very miscellaneous\r\ndonation; these, most probably, are included among the curious fragments\r\nwhich decorate some of the Library windows.\r\n\r\nSix Persian MSS. were given by the late venerable Principal of Magdalen\r\nHall, and Lord Almoner's Reader in Arabic, Dr. Macbride. The signature\r\nof this gentleman, who has only been removed by death while these sheets\r\nhave been passing through the press, occurs in the Admission-book of the\r\nlast century, as having been admitted to read in the Library, while\r\nstill an undergraduate of Exeter College, on May 10, 1797.\r\n\r\n_Alderman Fletcher's illustrated copy of Gulch's Wood._ See under 1610.\r\n\r\nMr. John Walker, Queen's College (B.A. 1820; Chaplain of New College,\r\nM.A., 1823), succeeded Mr. Fenton as _minister_ in July.\r\n\r\n[299] The minuteness of specification is such that '_Turner's Real Japan\r\nBlacking, a Label_' is duly entered.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1819.\r\n\r\nA copy of the extremely rare Polish version of the Bible, made by the\r\nSocinians at the expense of Prince Nicholas Radzivil, and printed in\r\n1563, was bought for £45[300]; and a folio Psalter, printed by Fust and\r\nSchoeffer in 1459, (finished Aug. 29), on vellum, for £70. The second\r\nvellum printed book in the Library is a copy of Durandus' _Rationale_,\r\nprinted by the same printers in the same year, but completed on Oct. 6.\r\nThis was bought in 1790 for £80 10_s._ Large additions were made to the\r\ncollection of Aldines.\r\n\r\nThe name of Lady Hester Stanhope occurs among the benefactors as\r\npresenting an Arabic MS. of the Romance of Antar, in thirty volumes.\r\n\r\n[300] The rarity of this edition was caused by its being bought up and\r\ndestroyed by the sons of Prince Radzivil.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1820.\r\n\r\nFrom Messrs. Payne and Foss was bought, for £150, the famous MS. of the\r\nGreek New Testament called, from its former possessor, the 'Codex\r\nEbnerianus.' It is a small quarto, containing 425 leaves of fine vellum,\r\nin excellent condition and well written, and ornamented with eleven rich\r\npaintings, besides occasional arabesque borders, &c. It comprehends all\r\nthe books of the New Testament except the Apocalypse, and is assigned in\r\ndate to the twelfth or thirteenth century. The former owner, whose name\r\nit perpetuates, Jerome William Ebner von Eschenbach, of Nuremberg,\r\nobtained it, it is said, when first brought from the East 'ex singulari\r\nNuminis providentia.' While in his possession, a small descriptive\r\nvolume, comprising forty-four pages and an engraved facsimile, was\r\npublished by Conrad Schoenleben, under the title of _Notitia egregii\r\ncodicis Græci Novi Testamenti manuscripti_, &c. 4^o. Norib. 1738. This\r\nwas incorporated by De Murr in his _Memorabilia Bibliothecarum\r\npublicarum Norimbergensium_, published in 1788, part ii. p. 100, who\r\nadded thirteen well-engraved plates of the illuminations, binding and\r\ntext. It was formerly bound in leather-covered boards, ornamented with\r\ngold, with five silver-gilt stars on the sides, and fastened with four\r\nsilver clasps. This cover being much decayed, Ebner cased the volume in\r\na most costly binding of pure silver, preserving the silver stars, and\r\naffixing on the outside a beautiful ivory figure (coæval with the MS.)\r\nof our Saviour, throned, and in the attitude of benediction. Above the\r\nfigure, Ebner engraved an inscription in Greek characters, corresponding\r\nto the style of the MS., praying for a blessing upon himself and his\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nA MS. of Terence, of the eleventh or twelfth century, which also\r\nbelonged to Ebner, was bought from Payne and Foss, at the same time, for\r\nten guineas. It is described in De Murr, _ubi supra_, pp. 135-7.\r\n\r\nFifty Greek manuscripts were bought for £500, which had formerly been in\r\nthe possession of Giovanni Saibante, of Verona. The library of this\r\ncollector is noticed in Scipio Maffei's _Verona Illustrata_ (fol. 1731),\r\npart ii. col. 48[301]. The MSS. purchased by the Library are described\r\nin Mr. Coxe's Catalogue, cols. 774-808.\r\n\r\nA collection of Arabic tracts and papers, which had formerly belonged to\r\nDr. Kennicott, was given by Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham.\r\n\r\n[301] Some MSS. which had belonged to Saibante, together with some of\r\nthe Abate Canonici's collection, which had been brought to England by\r\nthe Abate Celotti, were sold by auction, in London, in 1821. The sale of\r\na further portion, which had passed into the hands of P. de' Gianfilippi\r\n(also of Verona), took place at Paris in January, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1821.\r\n\r\nThe great event of this year was the reception of the famous and\r\nextensive collection of English dramatic literature and early poetry,\r\nformed by Edmund Malone[302]. It was bequeathed by him on his decease\r\n(May 25, 1812) to his brother, Lord Sunderlin, with the expression of a\r\nwish that, if not retained as an heirloom in the family, it should be\r\ndeposited in some public library. In fulfilment of this wish, Lord\r\nSunderlin communicated to the University, in 1815, his intention to\r\ntransfer the collection to the Bodleian so soon as Mr. James Boswell, to\r\nwhom it was entrusted in order to assist him in the preparation of a new\r\nedition of Malone's _Shakespeare_, should have finished his use of it.\r\nThat edition being at length issued in 1821, the library was sent to\r\nOxford in the same year. The character of the collection is too well\r\nknown to need description; suffice it to say that it contains upwards of\r\n800 volumes, of which by far the greater number are distinguished by\r\ntheir rarity. There are first quartos of many of Shakespeare's plays,\r\nand second editions of others[303]; of his collected works there are\r\nboth the first and second folios. Barnfield, Beaumont and Fletcher,\r\nChapman, Decker, Greene, Heywood, Ben Jonson, Lodge, Massinger, Rich.\r\nTaylor the water-poet, and Whetstone are amongst those who are most\r\nfully represented. There are also a few MSS. A Catalogue of the\r\ncollection, in folio (52 pp.), with a life of Malone by Boswell\r\n(previously printed in _Gent. Magaz._ and Nichol's _Lit. Hist._), was\r\npublished in 1836; and, in 1861, Mr. J. O. Halliwell printed fifty-one\r\ncopies of a small _Hand-list_ of the early English literature preserved\r\nin it. Various volumes of Malone's own MSS. collections have been\r\nsubsequently added by purchase; viz. in 1836 some papers relating to the\r\nlife and writings of Pope; in 1838, his collections for the last\r\nedition of his _Shakespeare_ and for the illustration of ancient\r\nmanners, together with a portion of his literary correspondence; in 1851\r\na volume of letters written to him by Bishop Percy, between 1783 and\r\n1807; in 1858 three octavo volumes of collections made by him at Oxford;\r\nand in 1864 a volume of letters to him from Dr. Johnson, Mrs. Siddons,\r\nand others. A large series of pamphlets, chiefly relating to Irish\r\nhistory and to literary matters, comprised in seventy-five volumes, was\r\nalso purchased in 1838[304]. Almost all his books are uniformly bound in\r\nhalf-calf, with 'E. M.' in an interlaced monogram on the back; a very\r\nfew have a book-plate consisting of his coat-of-arms within a square of\r\nbooks, with the inscription (in imitation of Grolier's) 'Edm. Malone et\r\namicorum,' and a motto from the _Menagiana_.\r\n\r\nA curious instance of the variableness and uncertainty of the prices of\r\nbooks is afforded by the purchase-list of this year, when contrasted\r\nwith prices paid at the present time. A copy (wanting the preliminary\r\nleaves and a few others) of one of the Antwerp editions of Tyndale's New\r\nTest. in 1534, (which had belonged to Mr. Benj. Ibott, and is mentioned\r\nin Herbert's _Ames_, vol. iii. p. 1543) was bought for nineteen\r\nshillings; Mr. Stevens in 1855 priced another imperfect copy at fifteen\r\nguineas. But, on the other hand, £63 were given in this year for the\r\nrare _Ed. Pr._ of Virgil, printed by Sweynheim and Pannartz in\r\n1469[305]. A somewhat similar instance occurred also in 1826, when\r\nDaye's edition of the Apocrypha, printed in 1549 (being vol. iv. of his\r\nedition of the Bible in that year), was obtained for fifteen shillings,\r\nwhile £73 10_s._ were paid for an edition of Virgil printed at Venice\r\nabout 1473.\r\n\r\nThe very rare German Bible, printed at Strasburgh about 1466, was bought\r\nfor £42, and a perfect copy of the first edition of the Bishops' Bible,\r\nin 1568, for seven guineas[306]. A volume of interest in typographical\r\nhistory was presented, in the first book printed in New South Wales. It\r\nis entitled _Michael Howe, the last and worst of the Bush Rangers of Van\r\nDieman's Land; narrative of the chief atrocities committed by this great\r\nmurderer and his associates during a period of six years in Van Dieman's\r\nLand_: it extends to thirty-six small octavo pages, and was printed at\r\nHobart Town, by Andrew Bent, in Dec, 1818[307].\r\n\r\nThe Catalogue of the Oriental MSS., commenced in the year 1787 by Uri,\r\nwas continued in this year by the publication by Mr. Nicoll of the first\r\npart of a second volume, containing notices of 234 additional Arabic\r\nMSS. His premature death occurred before the publication of the second\r\npart, which he had printed as far as p. 388; this was completed and\r\nedited (with nine lithographic plates of specimens of Arabic MSS.) by\r\nhis successor in the Hebrew Professorship, Dr. Pusey, in 1835. It\r\ncontains altogether descriptions of 296 Arabic volumes, together with\r\ncopious additions by Dr. Pusey to Uri's first portion, which are noticed\r\nabove, p. 199.\r\n\r\nThe Parish Registers of Newington, Kent, and of Bures, in Suffolk, which\r\nhad come into the Library among Dr. Rawlinson's books, were restored to\r\ntheir respective parishes by a decree submitted to Convocation on Nov.\r\n9. In the Register of Convocation itself, by a singular omission, no\r\nmention of the former of these parish books is made (although included\r\nin the proposal), and the restoration of that of Bures is alone\r\nrecorded. But by enquiry addressed to the Vicar of Newington, it has\r\nbeen ascertained that one of the Registers contains a memorandum of its\r\nhaving been returned by vote of Convocation on the day in question.\r\n\r\nBy a vote of Convocation on July 7, the rooms on the first floor of the\r\nSchools' quadrangle, which were formerly used as the Hebrew and Greek\r\nSchools, were assigned to the Library; the former (on the south side)\r\nnow contains, in two rooms, the Bodley, Laud, and other collections of\r\nMSS.; the latter (on the north side), also in two rooms, the foreign and\r\nEnglish periodicals[308].\r\n\r\nOn May 25, a plan for warming the Library was, for the first time,\r\nadopted. It consisted in introducing hot air simply at two small\r\ngratings at one end of the Library, from pipes communicating with a\r\nstove placed (with the consent of Exeter College) where the furnace of\r\nthe present apparatus is situated, in the wall between the north-west\r\ncorner of the Library and the Ashmolean Museum. As a means of warming\r\nthe Library generally the system was wholly ineffectual, no benefit\r\nbeing experienced except by those who remained in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the gratings. It remained, however, in use until 1845, when pipes\r\nwere laid down through a considerable part of the Library for the\r\npurpose of warming it by steam. This plan, however, did not give\r\nsatisfaction, either on the ground of safety or of effectiveness. In\r\n1855 Mr. Braidwood, the late distinguished head of the London Fire\r\nBrigade, was brought down to survey the apparatus and to examine\r\ngenerally how the Library could best be secured against fire; and, by\r\nhis advice and that of Mr. G. G. Scott, the pipes were enclosed in slate\r\ncasings, so as effectually to hinder contact with any inflammable\r\nmaterials, and two fire-proof iron doors were inserted at the entrances\r\nto the great Reading-room, in order to cut it off from the rest of the\r\nbuilding[309]. But in 1861 steam was discarded for the safer and more\r\neffectual system, now in use, of warming by hot water; new pipes (cased\r\nin slate) were laid down by Messrs. Haden and Son, and were carried\r\nthrough the Examination Schools on the ground-floor of the quadrangle,\r\nas well as through the Library.\r\n\r\nIn Feb. Mr. J. P. Roberts, New College (B.A. 1821, M.A. 1826, now Minor\r\nCanon of Chichester) was appointed _minister_, _vice_ Mr. P. Barrett,\r\nWadham College (B.A. 1828); and Mr. Robert Eden, of St. John's College\r\n(Corp. Chr. Coll. B.A. 1825, M.A. 1827, now Vicar of Wymondham,\r\nNorfolk), was appointed _vice_ Walker. From this time there appear to\r\nhave been two assistants, although it was not until 1837 that that\r\nnumber was formally allowed by Statute.\r\n\r\n[302] Malone was the son of an Irish Judge. He was born in Dublin, Oct.\r\n4, 1741, was educated at Trin. Coll. Dublin, where he took the degree of\r\nM.A., and became a barrister, but soon retired from legal practice.\r\n\r\n[303] For notices of the purchase of several early quartos, wanting in\r\nthis series, see 1834.\r\n\r\n[304] These are now incorporated with the large collection called\r\n_Godwyn Pamphlets_. A copy of Wood's _Ath. Oxon._ with MSS. notes by\r\nMalone, was given by Mr. B. H. Bright in 1835.\r\n\r\n[305] Various other _editt. princ._ were bought in this year, with some\r\nAldines. Also a collection of modern Greek works printed at Venice.\r\n\r\n[306] Offor's copy sold for £41; Lea Wilson's for £61 10_s._\r\n\r\n[307] The present writer has in his possession an early newspaper\r\nprinted in New Zealand, the _Auckland Times_, No. 41, for Apr. 6, 1843,\r\nnot merely curious in relation to the history of the colony, but also as\r\na typographical relic. Its crowning interest is to be found in its\r\ncolophon (if such a classical word may be applied to the imprint of a\r\nnewspaper), which states that it was '_Printed in a mangle_.'\r\n\r\n[308] In Lascelles' Account of Oxford, published in this year, it is\r\nsaid that the printed books in the Library were computed at 160,000, and\r\nthe MSS. at 30,000.\r\n\r\n[309] Mr. Braidwood's report was printed in 1856, together with one from\r\nMr. Scott, on the extension of the Library, and the means of rendering\r\nit fire-proof.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1822.\r\n\r\nIn July, the Rev. Dr. Bliss returned to the Library as Sub-librarian, in\r\nthe room of Mr. Nicoll, appointed Regius Professor of Hebrew. And in\r\nOctober the Rev. Rich. French Laurence, M.A., of Pembroke College,\r\nsucceeded Dr. Cotton, who quitted Oxford for Ireland.\r\n\r\n'Tuesday, August 6, 1822, I was at the Library the whole day, and not a\r\nsingle member of the University came into the room, excepting Mr. Eden,\r\nthe assistant. Oxford race-day.' This note occurs in vol. x. of Dr.\r\nBliss's MS. antiquarian and miscellaneous memoranda. Considering that\r\nthe time of the year was well-nigh the middle of the Long Vacation, it\r\ndoes not seem surprising that on one day there should have been no\r\nacademic readers in the Library, even if there may have been academic\r\nriders on the race-course. The two occurrences have so little\r\ncorrespondence with each other that one would hope that the zealous\r\nSub-librarian (who has deemed the same want of readers worth\r\ncommemorating also in another note) assigned _non causa pro causa_.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1823.\r\n\r\nBy the exertions of the brothers J. S. and P. B. Duncan, Esqs., Fellows\r\nof New College, distinguished for their efforts to promote the study of\r\nthe Arts and Sciences in the University, a subscription-fund was raised\r\nfor the purpose of adorning the Picture Gallery with plaster models of\r\nsome of the finest buildings of Greek and Roman antiquity. The result\r\nwas that in the present year the following series, by Fouquet, of Paris,\r\nwas placed in the Gallery, at a total cost of about £400:--The Arch of\r\nConstantine, the Parthenon, the Temple of the Sybil at Tivoli, the\r\nMaison Carrée at Nismes, the Erechtheum and Lantern of Demosthenes at\r\nAthens, the Theatre of Herculaneum, and the Temple of Fortuna Virilis at\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nA large number of works by foreign authors, chiefly theological, was\r\nbought (for £375) at the sale at Leyden of the library of Jonas Wilh. Te\r\nWater, professor of Eccl. Hist. in that University. A separate\r\ncatalogue, occupying twenty-three folio pages, was issued of these\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nMr. E. P. New, of St. John's College (B.A. 1822, M.A. 1825, B.D. 1831),\r\nwas appointed in December to assist in the compilation of the new\r\nCatalogue; but how long he remained in the Library does not appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1824.\r\n\r\nA collection of valuable original papers relating to affairs in Church\r\nand State, which had belonged to Archbishop Sheldon, were sold by his\r\ngreat-nephew, Sir John English Dolben, of Finedon, Northamptonshire, to\r\nthe Library for £40 5_s._ They are now bound in six volumes, of which\r\nthree are lettered _Sheldon_, and three _Dolben_. Of the first three,\r\ntwo contain letters from English, Welsh, Scotch and Irish Bishops, and\r\nthe contents of the other are miscellaneous; of the second three, one\r\ncontains miscellaneous letters and papers commencing at 1585, another\r\nhas similar papers from 1626 to 1721, and the third contains\r\nmiscellaneous ecclesiastical letters and documents. Some of the letters\r\nare addressed to the Archbishop's secretary, Miles Smyth, Esq. A short\r\nletter from Sir John Dolben to Dr. Bandinel, relating to his disposal of\r\nthese papers, dated Oct. 12, 1824, is preserved in Bodl. MS. Addit. ii.\r\nA. 32. He had previously given, in 1822, a fine copy of a quarto Bible\r\nwhich had belonged to Sheldon, containing (1) the Prayer-Book and\r\nMetrical Psalms, printed at Cambridge in 1638, (2) the Old Test.,\r\nprinted by Field at London in 1648, and (3) the New Test., Cambr. 1637.\r\nAt the end are some memoranda by the Archbishop of the births, baptisms,\r\nand deaths of members of the Sheldon and Okeover families, and of the\r\nlegitimate children of Charles II and the Duke of York. The Library more\r\nthan a century before had received benefactions from a member of the\r\nsame family of Dolben; Gilbert Dolben, of Finedon, having given some\r\nprinted books in 1697, together with a manuscript of Gower. And twenty\r\nvols. of Chamberlaine's _State of Great Britain_ were given by Mr. J. E.\r\nDolben in 1796. An additional volume of the Sheldon correspondence was\r\ngiven to the Library in 1840, by Dr. Routh, the President of Magdalen\r\nCollege. It is a copy-book of business-letters written by the\r\nArchbishop. In a note to Dr. Bandinel which accompanied the gift, and\r\nwhich is now fixed in vol. i. of Burnet's autograph copy of his _Own\r\nTimes_, Dr. Routh says:--\r\n\r\n    'The President takes the opportunity of sending a volume containing\r\n    the first draught of letters sent by Archbp. Sheldon to different\r\n    persons, together with a few other contemporary papers. They were\r\n    put into the President's hands by the late Sir John English Dolben,\r\n    and as the University purchased of that gentleman what were commonly\r\n    called the Sheldon Papers, he thinks they cannot be deposited\r\n    anywhere more suitably than in the Bodleian Library.'\r\n\r\nTo the annual catalogue for this year was attached a special list,\r\nfilling thirty-two folio pages, of the books (upwards of 1500 in number)\r\nwhich were bought at the Hague, at the sale of the library collected by\r\nthe distinguished Dutch scholars and lawyers, Gerard and John Meerman.\r\nThe sale-catalogue is a volume of more than 1200 pages. The books bought\r\nfor the Library were chiefly such as supplied deficiencies in foreign\r\nhistory and law, together with some Greek[310] and Latin MSS., for the\r\nmost part patristic and classical. The sum expended was £925. Some rare\r\nSpanish historical books (in which class of literature, thanks to Dr.\r\nBandinel's care in keeping it steadily in view, the Library is now very\r\nrich) were bought at the sale of Don J. Ant. Conde.\r\n\r\nBut the chief distinction of this year lies in the acquisition, by\r\nbequest of Mrs. Elizabeth Dennis Denyer (widow of Mr. John Denyer, of\r\nChelsea, who died in 1806) of a most valuable collection of early\r\neditions of the English Bible, numbering altogether about twenty-five.\r\nTo show the rarity and worth of this collection, it will be sufficient\r\nto mention but a few of the volumes which it contains. _Imprimis_,\r\nCoverdale's first edition, 1535[311], and his second edition, 1537;\r\nCranmer's, in April, 1540 and in 1541, and by Grafton in 1553;\r\nMatthew's, by Becke, in 1551; Tyndale's New Testament, in 1536, and\r\nanother of his earliest editions; Hollybush's English and Latin\r\nTestament, 1538, and Erasmus' Testament, 1540. Besides the Biblical\r\ncollection, Mrs. Denyer also bequeathed twenty-one English theological\r\nworks, nearly all printed before 1600; including a beautiful copy of\r\nFisher on the Penitential Psalms (by Wynkyn de Worde) and books by\r\n(amongst others) Bale, Bonner, Brightwell, Erasmus, Hooper, Joye, and\r\nTonstall.\r\n\r\nMr. L. E. Judge, New College (B.A. 1827, M.A. 1830; Chaplain; deceased\r\n1853), succeeded Mr. Roberts, in March, as assistant; but in July of the\r\nnext year retired, and was succeeded by Mr. W. Bailey, also of New\r\nCollege (B.A. 1829).\r\n\r\n[310] These, in number thirty-eight, are described in Mr. Coxe's\r\nCatalogue, cols. 724-773. An eighth-century copy of Eusebius'\r\n_Chronicon_ is among the Latin MSS.\r\n\r\n[311] Wanting title and map. A title had been supplied by Mrs. Denyer,\r\nwho in several instances had supplied deficiencies very successfully in\r\npen and ink; a perfect facsimile, however, by Mr. J. Harris, which might\r\npass for the original, were not the minute mark '_Fs. T. H._' seen on\r\nthe back of the page, has since been substituted. It is a marvel of\r\ncaligraphic skill. Another imperfect copy came to the Library among\r\nSelden's books.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1825.\r\n\r\nThe sale at Paris of the library of L. M. Langlès, the keeper of the\r\nOriental MSS. in the Bibl. Royale, afforded a large accession of books\r\nin that branch of literature which was his specialty.\r\n\r\nMr. Sim. J. Etty, New College (B.A. 1829, M.A. 1832, now Vicar of\r\nWanborough, Wilts), was appointed assistant in the room of Mr. Eden. Mr.\r\nEtty remained in the Library until the year 1834. The Catalogue of\r\n_Dissertationes Academicæ_, which appeared in 1832, was in a great\r\nmeasure his work.\r\n\r\nTwo MSS. intended of old for the Library by Sir K. Digby, were bought in\r\nthis year. To the account of them given at p. 58 _supra_, it should be\r\nadded that the library left in France by Digby on his death (from which,\r\nno doubt, these volumes came) was bought back by George, Earl of\r\nBristol, and finally sold by auction at London, in April and May, 1680.\r\nSixty-nine MSS. were included in this dispersion. It should further be\r\nadded to the previous notice that it was at Laud's instance, and through\r\nhim as Chancellor of the University, that Digby presented his collection\r\nto the Library. A letter from the Archbishop, which accompanied the\r\ngift, is printed in Wharton's collection of his _Remains_, vol. ii. p.\r\n73.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1826.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to notice in the acquisitions of this year. A few\r\nPersian and other Oriental MSS. were purchased, and more in the two\r\nfollowing years; and some Burmese MSS. were given by Sir C. Grey, Chief\r\nJustice of Calcutta. A curious volume of manuscript and printed papers\r\nrelative to the siege of Oxford, 1643-46, was presented by Mr. W.\r\nHamper, of Birmingham. In January, the Rev. Chas. Hen. Cox, M.A.,\r\nStudent of Ch. Ch., was appointed Sub-librarian in the room of Mr.\r\nLaurence.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1827.\r\n\r\nA very large collection of Academic Dissertations published in Germany,\r\namounting to about 43,400, was bought at Altona for £332 16_s._ Of these\r\na folio catalogue was published in 1834, which, by a singular error,\r\nbears on its title the date 1832, as the year in which this accession\r\ncame to the Library. In 1828, 160 volumes of the same character were\r\nadded, and other large additions were made in 1836 and 1837, but\r\nparticularly in 1846, when no fewer than 7000 were purchased[312].\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Forster, New College (B.A. 1832, M.A. 1834; Esquire Bedel of\r\nDivinity; deceased 1857), succeeded Mr. Bailey, in March, as Assistant.\r\n\r\n[312] There is scarcely an imaginable subject in law, theology, or\r\nhistory, on which something may not be found in this vast collection.\r\nThe _something_ may often be meagre and superficial, but it is still\r\noftener curious, and even in the former case it may be useful as\r\npointing to sources of further information. In days of Ritual\r\ncontroversy, one party or another may be glad to know that in 1725,\r\nGeorge Henry Goetz, D.D., wrote on the interesting question whether a\r\nclergyman might do duty in his dressing-gown,--_Num Verbi ministro toga\r\ncubicularia_ (Schlaffpeltze) _induto officio sacro defungi liceat?_\r\nThose who know what curses were invoked of old upon the heads of\r\nstealers of books, may be interested in hearing what one Pipping had to\r\nsay on the subject in 1721, in his _Diss. de Imprecationibus libris\r\nascriptis_; while the title of Sam. Schelging's discourse in 1729, _De\r\nApparitionibus mortuorum vivis ex pacto factis_, will have attraction\r\nfor not a few. Sometimes the dryest subjects were lightened up at the\r\nclose with ponderous jokes, or unexpected turns were given to the matter\r\nin hand; _e.g._ those worthy Germans who had gone to sleep at Jena, in\r\n1660, during the reading of a dissertation _De Jure et Potestate\r\nParlamenti Britannici_, by one J. A. Gerhard, (who must have taken\r\nunusual interest in the history of the English Rebellion,) were wakened\r\nup at the end by the discussion of the following novel questions in\r\nlaw:--'Casus ex jure privato.\r\n\r\n'I. Titius ducit uxorem Caiam. Caia, elapso uno vel altero anno,\r\ntransmutatur in virum. Q. an Caia hæc, soluto per hanc metamorphosin\r\nmatrimonio, possit repetere dotem? Dist.\r\n\r\n'II. Sempronia, defuncto marito Mævio, nubit Titio. Mævius divinâ\r\npotentiâ in vitam resuscitatur mortalem. Q. an Mævius hic, secundum\r\nvivus, uxorem Semproniam et bona sua repetere possit? Aff.'\r\n\r\nIt was usual for the friends of the candidate who defended the thesis of\r\nthe Dissertation (generally written for him by the _Præses_) to attach\r\nsome complimentary letters or verses. In the case of those published at\r\nUpsal, the zeal of the encomiasts frequently breaks out into wild\r\ncompositions in Hebrew, Greek, French, German and English, affording in\r\nthe latter instance (and it may be in others) very curious specimens of\r\nthe language. A laborious trifler, named P. Wettersten, compliments a\r\nfriend, who had read at Upsal, in 1742, a dissertation by Prof. Peter\r\nEkerman on the antiquities of a small town called Norkoping, with a kind\r\nof acrostic in twenty-five lines on the verse, 'Nunc erit et seclis\r\nNorcopia clara futuris,' which, starting from the centre of the page,\r\nmay be read upwards, downwards, and in every form of mazy irregularity;\r\nevery way, in short, except the right.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1828.\r\n\r\nA collection of 153 Northern MSS., chiefly in the Icelandic and Danish\r\nlanguages, formed by Finn Magnusen, was purchased from him for\r\n£350[313]. A catalogue (56 pp. quarto) was published in the year 1832.\r\nAmongst them are many early and curious volumes in poetry and history.\r\nOther collections of MSS. were sold by the same collector to the British\r\nMuseum and to the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nA large number of Aldines were obtained at the sale of the collection of\r\nM. Renouard, the Aldine bibliographer, which took place in London, June\r\n26-30. And the rare first edition of John Knox's _Historie of the Church\r\nof Scotland_ was purchased for sixteen guineas.\r\n\r\nSome additional rooms on the second story of the Schools' quadrangle, on\r\nthe north and east sides, which went by the names of the Schools of\r\nGeometry and Medicine, were permanently attached to the Library, by vote\r\nof Convocation, on June 5.\r\n\r\nOn June 26, the nomination of the Rev. Stephen Reay, M.A., of St.\r\nAlban's Hall (afterwards B.D., and Laudian Professor of Arabic in 1840),\r\nas Sub-librarian in the room of Mr. C. H. Cox, was approved in\r\nConvocation. Mr. Reay was appointed to the charge of the Oriental\r\ndepartment, his knowledge of Hebrew specially qualifying him for the\r\ncare of the yearly increasing mass of Rabbinical lore. To this branch he\r\nadded, and retained to the close of his life, the care of the 'Progress'\r\nRoom, or room containing the publications, foreign and English, which\r\nappeared in parts. And on Dec. 20, the Rev. John Besly, M.A., Fellow of\r\nBalliol (afterwards D.C.L., and Vicar of Long Benton, Northumberland,\r\ndeceased April 17, 1868, aged sixty-eight), was confirmed as Mr. Reay's\r\ncolleague, in the place of Dr. Bliss.\r\n\r\n[313] Some notes by G. J. Thorkelin on Northern Antiquities were bought\r\nin 1846.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1829.\r\n\r\nThe great Hebrew collection, which at present forms so distinguished a\r\nfeature in the contents of the Library, was virtually commenced in this\r\nyear by the purchase, at Hamburgh (for £2080), of the famous Oppenheimer\r\nlibrary, consisting of upwards of 5000 volumes, of which 780 are\r\nMSS[314]. Many Hebrew works had, it is true, come with Selden's library,\r\nin 1659; but little or nothing had been done since that period to\r\nadvance upon that beginning. The additions made in this department from\r\n1844 up to about the year 1857, are said, in Dr. Steinschneider's\r\nintroduction to his catalogue (_col._ 50), to have numbered no fewer\r\nthan about 2100 volumes[315].\r\n\r\nDavid Oppenheimer, Chief Rabbi at Prague, devoted more than half a\r\ncentury to the formation of his library. On his death, Sept. 23, 1735,\r\nit came into the possession of his son, a Rabbi at Hildesheim, and\r\nthence into the hands of Isaac Seligmann at Hamburgh. Several catalogues\r\nwere issued during this period, the last being one in octavo, at\r\nHamburgh, in 1826, an index to which, compiled by Dr. J. Goldenthal, was\r\nprinted at the expense of the Library in 1845. The collection would have\r\nbeen dispersed by auction, had it not been bought _en masse_ for Oxford.\r\nIt possesses extreme interest and value in the eyes of Jewish students,\r\ninsomuch that for a series of years the Library was never without\r\nseveral foreign visitors engaged in its examination. A very elaborate\r\ncatalogue of all the printed Hebrew books contained in it, and\r\nthroughout the whole of the Library, was compiled by Dr. M.\r\nSteinschneider during the years 1850-1860, and printed at Berlin, where\r\nit was published in the latter year in a very thick quarto volume. The\r\nbook is divided into two parts: the first containing a description of\r\nthe Biblical, Talmudical, liturgical and anonymous volumes; the second\r\ncontaining the works of miscellaneous authors, in the alphabetical order\r\nof their names. Prefixed is a brief list of the Hebrew MSS. in the\r\nLibrary, with the numbers at present attached to them, and references to\r\nthe catalogues in which they are described. Of several rare books in the\r\nOppenheimer library there are duplicate copies, varying in condition and\r\nornamentation; of some there are copies on red, yellow, and blue paper.\r\nDistinguished amongst all is a copy of the Talmud, printed in 1713-28,\r\nin twenty-four folio volumes, entirely on vellum. 'Perhaps,' says\r\nArchdeacon Cotton, 'this work is the grandest and most extensive vellum\r\npublication extant[316].'\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Bowyer, miniature painter to Queen Charlotte, who had devoted\r\na considerable part of his life to the collection of drawings and\r\nengravings illustrating the Holy Scriptures, put forward a proposal for\r\ntheir purchase by subscription with a view to their being deposited in\r\nthe Bodleian. Their number amounted to nearly seven thousand (including\r\n113 drawings by Loutherbourg), described as being in fine condition and\r\nof great value; and they were inserted as additional illustrations in a\r\ncopy of Macklin's folio Bible, which was enlarged thereby from its\r\noriginal extent of seven volumes to forty-five. Hence the collection\r\npassed, and passes, under the name of Bowyer's Bible. Mr. Bowyer, who\r\nhad spent upon it upwards of three thousand pounds, proposed to dispose\r\nof it for £2500, and a committee was formed in London, upon which\r\nappeared the names of many distinguished persons, to raise a\r\nsubscription for the purpose. But upon Mr. Bowyer's despatching an agent\r\nto Oxford, the matter met with so little encouragement here, the\r\nLibrarian, in particular, being (as Dr. Bliss has noted upon his copy of\r\nthe original proposal) unfavourable to it, that the project fell to the\r\nground. The reasons why Oxford made so little response do not appear;\r\nprobably the value set upon the collection was deemed to be greatly\r\nexaggerated. After the death of Mr. Bowyer (June 4, 1834, aged\r\nseventy-six) the Bible came into the hands of one Mrs. Parkes, of Golden\r\nSquare, by whom it was disposed of, in 1848, in a lottery (together with\r\na few other prizes) for which four thousand tickets were issued at one\r\nguinea each. The successful speculator was Mr. Saxon, a\r\ngentleman-farmer, near Shepton Mallet. In 1852 it was in the hands of\r\nMessrs. Puttick and Simpson, the well-known book-auctioneers, for sale.\r\nBy them it was announced for an auction on Feb. 26, 1853, and was\r\ndisposed of, about that time, to Messrs. Willis and Sotheran, the\r\nbooksellers, for about £500. Since then it has been announced for sale\r\nat Manchester.\r\n\r\n[314] One MS. which had strayed from Oppenheimer's library previously to\r\nits transfer to the Bodleian, was purchased and restored to its place in\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n[315] A notice of the Oppenheimer collection, and of the other Hebrew\r\nportions of the Library is given in the preface to vol. iii. of Fürst's\r\n_Bibliotheca Judaica_, 8^o. Leipz. 1863, pp. 42-51. The _Catalogus\r\nInterpretum S. Script._, by Thomas James, in 1635, is here metamorphosed\r\ninto one by Thomas _Jones_, in 1735.\r\n\r\n[316] _Typographical Gazetteer_, p. 349.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1830.\r\n\r\nA copy of the rare edition of Luther's translation of the Bible, printed\r\nat Wittemberg in 1541, was bought, through Messrs. Payne and Foss, for\r\nfifty guineas, at the sale, in London, of the library of the Archdeacon\r\nde la Tour, of Hildesheim, which was said to have been formerly the\r\nproperty of the English Benedictine Monastery of Landspring, and which\r\nwas then, it appears, in the possession of Mr. -- Solly. It contains some\r\ntexts on the fly-leaves in the autograph, and with the signatures, of\r\nboth Luther and Melanchthon, which seem to have been unnoticed at the\r\ntime of the sale. A facsimile of a part of Luther's inscription is\r\ngiven in plate xxxi. in Mr. Leigh Sotheby's _Illustrations of the\r\nHandwriting of Melanchthon_[317]. The book is now exhibited in a glass\r\ncase, in one of the windows of the Library.\r\n\r\n[317] A copy of this edition, with MS. notes by Luther, Melanchthon,\r\nBugenhagen and Major, was sold to the British Museum, at Hibbert's sale\r\nin 1829, for £267 15_s._!\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1831.\r\n\r\nIn December of this year, Viscount Kingsborough[318] presented a\r\nmagnificent copy (being one of four which were printed on vellum) of his\r\n_Antiquities of Mexico_, or coloured facsimiles, executed at his\r\nexpense, in seven folio volumes, of Mexican paintings and hieroglyphics\r\npreserved in the libraries of Paris, Berlin, Dresden, Vienna, Rome,\r\nBologna, and Oxford (in Laud's and Selden's collections), together with\r\npreliminary dissertations. This sumptuous book is exhibited near the\r\nentrance of the library, in a case made expressly for its reception.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, the nomination, as Sub-librarian, of Rev. Ernest Hawkins,\r\nM.A., of Balliol, afterwards Fellow of Exeter, (of late well-known for\r\nhis labours in the cause of Missions, as Secretary to the Society for\r\nthe Propagation of the Gospel), was approved by Convocation. He\r\nsucceeded Dr. Besly, who had taken the Balliol College living of Long\r\nBenton, in Northumberland.\r\n\r\n[318] This learned and spirited nobleman died, in 1837, in a debtors'\r\nprison in Dublin, where he was confined for liabilities incurred on\r\nbehalf of his father, the Earl of Kingston.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1832.\r\n\r\nA twelfth-century MS. of Scholia on the _Odyssey_ was purchased for\r\n£100. The collection of Bibles, which had during some time past made\r\nsome slow progress, was increased by copies of various early printed\r\nversions in European languages, and its further enlargement was steadily\r\nkept in view in succeeding years.\r\n\r\nSix guineas were given for copies of Servetus' treatise _De Trinitatis\r\nerroribus_ and his _Dialogi de Trinitate_, printed in 1531 and 1532,\r\nwhich are of very great rarity, in consequence of their having very\r\ngenerally shared the fate of their author.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1833.\r\n\r\nSome precious Shakespearian volumes, consisting of the _Venus and\r\nAdonis_ of 1594 and 1617, the _Lucrece_ of 1594 and 1616, with a\r\nsubsequent edition of 1655, and the _Sonnets_ of 1609, were presented by\r\nthe well-known collector, Mr. Thomas Caldecott, who had been formerly a\r\nFellow of New College. They are now incorporated with the Malone\r\ncollection. Several MSS. of Sir William Jones were presented by the\r\nbrothers Augustus and Julius C. Hare. An interesting and large\r\ncollection of tracts on the Roman Catholic disabilities, affairs in\r\nIreland, &c., in forty-five volumes, was purchased at the sale of the\r\nlibrary of Charles Butler, of Lincoln's Inn.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous pamphlet, entitled, _A Few Words on the Bodleian Library_,\r\nappeared in this year; its author was Sir Edmund Head, M.A., Merton\r\nCollege. The object was to urge the desirableness of allowing books to\r\nbe borrowed from the Library, after the example of Cambridge. One of the\r\narguments by which the author supported the proposal, viz. that College\r\ntutors were unable to visit the Library in term time during the hours at\r\nwhich it is open, has since been entirely removed by the attachment of\r\nthe Radcliffe Library as a Reading-room, which remains open until ten\r\no'clock at night. The pamphlet was reprinted in the Report of the\r\nUniversity Commission in 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1834.\r\n\r\nNumerous purchases were made during the sale of Mr. Heber's library.\r\nAmongst these were some rare English tracts of the Reformers, Bale,\r\nBecon, Tyndal, Knox, &c; a large and valuable collection of booksellers'\r\ncatalogues and sale catalogues of books and coins between 1726 and\r\n1814[319]; and a mass of some 1100 or 1200 plays, published in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries[320]. Numerous early Shakespeare\r\neditions were also obtained; _inter alias_, the first edition (1594) of\r\nthe first part of the _Contention betwixt the Houses of Yorke and\r\nLancaster_, for £64; _Richard III_, 1598, £17; fourth edit. of _Henry\r\nIV_, 1608, £12 12_s._[321], &c. The greater part of the collection of\r\neditions of Horace up to the year 1738, formed by Dr. Douglas, a\r\ncollection which was used in the preparation of the edition published at\r\nLondon, by James Watson, in 1760, was bought for £20. It consists of\r\ntwenty-seven vols. in folio, thirty-nine in quarto, and 248 in octavo\r\nand smaller sizes. Dibdin (_Introd. to the Classics_) says that the\r\nwhole collection consisted of 450 editions. A Prayer-Book of 1707, with\r\nMSS. collations by Rev. John Lewis, of Margate, of alterations in\r\neditions between 1549 and 1637, was bought for £8 8_s._ One of the\r\nchief gems in the Picture Gallery was bequeathed by James Paine, Esq.,\r\nbeing the portrait of his father, James Paine, the architect[322], while\r\ninstructing his son in drawing, by Sir Joshua Reynolds. This beautiful\r\npicture has retained its freshness of colour far more perfectly than\r\nmost others of Sir Joshua's paintings; and it has recently, under the\r\ndirection of the present Librarian, been carefully cleaned, and\r\nprotected with glass and a curtain, that its brilliancy may incur no\r\nrisk of deterioration. But this year is chiefly distinguished in the\r\nAnnals of the Library by the bequest of the\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUCE COLLECTION.\r\n\r\nFrancis Douce, the donor of this magnificent library (who died on March\r\n30, in this year), is said to have been induced to make this disposition\r\nof his treasures through the courteous reception afforded to him by Dr.\r\nBandinel, upon the occasion of a visit to Oxford, in 1830. The\r\ngatherings of a lifetime with which the Bodleian was thus enriched,\r\nconsist of 393 manuscripts, ninety-eight charters, about 16,480 printed\r\nvolumes, a very large collection of early and valuable prints and\r\ndrawings, and some coins[323]. For the most part, the books which thus\r\ncame were of classes in which the Library was then deficient. Nearly all\r\nthe finest specimens of Missal-painting which it now possesses are found\r\namong the Douce MSS., several of which are exhibited in a glass case at\r\nthe further end of the Library. Chief among these are three volumes of\r\n_Horæ_, one executed, perhaps by G. da Libri, at the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century for Leonora Gonzaga, Duchess of Urbino, a second\r\nbelonged to Mary de Medici, and the other was completed in 1527 for B.\r\nSforza, second wife of Sigism. I of Poland. These are priceless gems,\r\nrivalled only by such as the Bedford Missal. In the same case is a\r\nPsalter on purple vellum, probably of the ninth century, which came from\r\nthe old Royal Library of France, and which, from this circumstance and\r\nits age, has sometimes been called Charlemagne's Psalter. The printed\r\nbooks are rich in history, biography, antiquities, manners and customs,\r\nand the fine arts[324]. In Bibles (English and French), Horæ, Primers,\r\nBooks of Common Prayer and Psalters, the collection is very strong.\r\nAmong the Psalters is a copy of Archbishop Parker's rare metrical\r\nversion. Early French literature is also a conspicuous feature, in which\r\nthe Library had previously been very deficient. Of fifteenth-century\r\ntypography there are no fewer than 311 specimens. The finest of these is\r\na magnificent copy of Christoforo Landino's Italian translation of\r\nPliny's Natural History, printed on vellum by Nic. Janson, at Venice, in\r\n1476. It is enriched with exquisite illuminated borders at the\r\ncommencement of each book, a specimen of which, together with a\r\ndescription of the volume, is given in Shaw's _Illuminated Ornaments_,\r\npl. xxxviii[325]. There are also a large number of fragments of works by\r\nearly English printers, including two by Caxton, which are unique. One\r\nof these is a portion (two quarters of an octavo or duodecimo sheet) of\r\nan edition of the _Horæ_, conjecturally assigned by Mr. Blades to 1478,\r\nand the other is of an edition of the _Booke of Curtesye_, probably\r\nprinted in 1491, consisting of two quarto pages. There is also one of\r\nthe two known copies of a curious placard, issued by Caxton, inviting\r\nthose who were disposed to buy 'ony pyes of two and thre comemoracions\r\nof Salisburi vse' to come to him at Westminster, and they should have\r\nthem 'good chepe[326].' The other copy is in the possession of Earl\r\nSpencer. A very different, but still very curious, item is a large\r\ncollection of chap-books and children's penny books of the last century\r\nand commencement of the present; and two folio volumes are filled with\r\nblack-letter ballads. A catalogue of the library was published in one\r\nvolume, in folio, in 1840; the part containing the printed books was the\r\nwork of Mr. H. Symonds, of Magdalen Hall (B.A. 1840, M.A. 1842, now\r\nPrecentor of Norwich), and that which describes the Fragments, the\r\nCharters and the Manuscripts was drawn up by Rev. H. O. Coxe. From the\r\nyear 1839 until the commencement of 1842, Mr. Thomas Dodd, formerly a\r\nwell-known London dealer in prints, and author of the _Connoisseur's\r\nRepertory_, was employed in making a catalogue of the Douce prints and\r\ndrawings. This catalogue still remains in MS. Four very grand studies of\r\nheads, drawn either by Raffaelle or Giulio Romano, have recently been\r\nframed and hung at the western end of the Library.\r\n\r\nOn June 25, Convocation sanctioned the transfer to the Library of the\r\nroom immediately over the entrance in the gateway-tower of the Schools,\r\n(now called the _Mason Room_) which had been hitherto assigned as the\r\n'Savile Study,' on condition that a small room in the adjoining\r\nsouth-east angle of the quadrangle should be prepared at the expense of\r\nthe Bodleian for the reception of the MSS. and printed books,\r\ninstruments, &c., which were given to the University by Sir Henry Savile\r\nfor the use of his Professors. This is the room in which the Savile\r\nlibrary (which includes also some books given by Dr. Wallis and Sir\r\nChristopher Wren) is still preserved, under the charge of the Savilian\r\nProfessors of Geometry and Astronomy.\r\n\r\nOn July 5, Convocation confirmed the nomination of Rev. William Cureton,\r\nM.A., of Ch. Ch. (afterwards so well known for his Syriac studies,\r\nwhich gained him the patronage of the Prince Consort and a Canonry at\r\nWestminster), to the Sub-librarianship vacated by Rev. E. Hawkins.\r\n\r\nMr. Edmund Grove, of Magdalen College (who never graduated), was\r\nappointed Assistant in April, _vice_ Mr. Stephen Exup. Wentworth, of\r\nBalliol (B.A. 1833, M.A. 1835). Mr. Wentworth appears to have succeeded\r\nMr. Forster in 1832.\r\n\r\n[319] Another collection of sale catalogues in forty-five vols. was\r\npurchased in 1836.\r\n\r\n[320] Another collection, in twenty-eight vols., of plays chiefly dating\r\nfrom 1630 to 1707, was bought, in 1842, for £6 17_s._\r\n\r\n[321] In 1837 _Romeo and Juliet_, printed by Smethwicke, n. d., was\r\nbought for £9 10_s._; in 1840, _Richard III_, 1605, for £21, and\r\n_Hamlet_, 1611, for £10 10_s._; and in 1841 the first edit. 1595, of\r\npart iii. of _Henry VI._ was bought at Chalmers' sale for £131!\r\n\r\n[322] Mr. Paine died in France in 1789, aged 73 years. The picture was\r\npainted by Reynolds in June, 1764. Among the buildings erected by Paine\r\nwere Brocket Hall, Herts; Wardour Castle, Wilts; and Richmond Bridge.\r\n\r\n[323] To the British Museum Mr. Douce bequeathed his own Diaries and\r\nNotebooks, to remain sealed up until Jan. 1, 1900, in order that all of\r\nhis own and the succeeding generation may have passed away before the\r\npersonal histories which they undoubtedly contain are brought to light.\r\n\r\n[324] In the majority of instances the books bear MS. notes by Douce,\r\nwhich often are valuable for the references they afford to other works\r\nand sources of further information. A few specimens of some of the\r\nfuller notes of this kind were contributed by the present writer to the\r\nearly volumes of the second series of _Notes and Queries_. One book,\r\nviz. John Weever's _Epigrammes_, 1599, containing notes by Douce, which\r\nhad somehow escaped from his library before it came to Oxford, was\r\npurchased in 1838, for £24 10_s._ A letter written by Douce in 1804,\r\ndated from the British Museum, where he was for a short time Keeper of\r\nthe MSS., was bought in 1864, and a few other papers in 1866.\r\n\r\n[325] In the same beautiful volume are facsimiles from three of Douce's\r\nMS. _Horæ_.\r\n\r\n[326] A facsimile of this advertisement is given in the catalogue of the\r\nDouce library.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1835.\r\n\r\nThe original MS. of Burnet's _History of his Own Times_, with a copy\r\nprepared for the press, a portion of his _History of the Reformation_,\r\nand some other papers by him, was purchased, from a family descended\r\nfrom the Bishop, for £210. An account of these MSS. may be found at p.\r\n474 of the Appendix to Burnet's _History of James II_, being an extract\r\nfrom the _Own Times_ which Dr. Routh edited, with additional notes, when\r\nninety-six years old, in 1852. The copy prepared for the press is\r\nexpressly mentioned in the catalogue for 1835 as forming part of the\r\npurchase; and yet that copy appears from a passage in a letter from\r\nRawlinson, dated Aug. 18, 1743, to have been then in the hands of that\r\ncollector, whence it would have been supposed that it must have passed\r\nat once into the possession of the Library. After mentioning the book,\r\nRawlinson says, 'I purchased the MSS. of a gentleman who corrected the\r\npress where that book was printed, and amongst his papers I have all the\r\ncastrations[327].'\r\n\r\nThe MS. of Lewis' _Life of Wyclif_, with some additions by the author,\r\nwas bought for £4 14_s._ 6_d._ Various other MSS. by Lewis were already\r\nin the Library among Dr. Rawlinson's collections. The purchases of\r\nprinted books were chiefly amongst early editions of Classics (Juvenal,\r\nOvid, Virgil, &c), Fathers (Augustine, Jerome), Schoolmen, and a very\r\nlarge series of fifteenth-century editions of the Decretals, Digest,\r\nInstitutes, and other works in Canon and Civil Law. These were obtained\r\nat the sale of the famous library of Dr. Kloss, of Frankfort, whose\r\ncollection was so remarkably rich in books bearing MS. notes by\r\nMelanchthon.\r\n\r\nA curious collection of papers and pamphlets, printed and MS., relating\r\nto Spanish affairs, and of much interest to students of Spanish history,\r\ncontained in thirty-two volumes in folio and eighty in quarto, was\r\npurchased for £40. It was lot 4583 in Heber's sale, by whom it had been\r\nbought at the Yriarte sale for more than £100.\r\n\r\n[327] Ballard MS. ii. 88.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1836.\r\n\r\nAubrey's collection of notes and drawings concerning Druidical and Roman\r\nantiquities in Britain, together with some miscellaneous historical\r\nnotes, entitled by him _Monumenta Britannica_, in four parts (now bound\r\nin two folio volumes), was purchased, for £50, of Col. Charles Greville.\r\nAccounts of Avebury and Stonehenge, which are important from their early\r\ndate (the former being the earliest known), are to be found in these\r\ncurious and interesting volumes[328]. The remainder of Aubrey's MSS.\r\ncame to the Library in 1860, upon the transfer of the books from the\r\nAshmolean Museum. See _sub anno_ 1858.\r\n\r\nA collection of about 300 tracts, relating to American affairs and the\r\nWar of Independence, in forty-one vols., formed by Rev. Jonathan\r\nBoucher[329], was bought for £8 18_s._ 6_d._ These are now included in\r\nthe series of tracts called _Godwyn Pamphlets_, in continuation of those\r\nwhich came, in 1770, from the donor so named. Another large gathering of\r\nAmerican tracts, collected by Mr. George Chalmers, when engaged in\r\nwriting his _History of the Revolt_, was bought in 1841 for £24 13_s._;\r\nat the same time, the first and only volume of his _History_, which\r\nitself was never actually published, was bought for £2 7_s._\r\n\r\n_Sale Catalogues._ See 1834.\r\n\r\nWhen the new Copyright Act was introduced into Parliament in this year,\r\nit was proposed to allow £500 _per annum_ to the Bodleian, in the manner\r\nadopted with regard to six other libraries, in lieu of the old privilege\r\nof receiving a copy of every book entered at Stationers' Hall. The\r\nCurators, however, on May 27, resolved that it would be highly desirable\r\nto retain the privilege, but that, should an alteration be made, it\r\nwould be inexpedient to receive an annual grant by way of compensation;\r\nand in consequence of this opinion, the proposed abolition of the\r\nprivilege was abandoned.\r\n\r\n[328] A short description of them will be found in Gough's _Brit.\r\nTopogr._ vol. ii. pp. 369-70, and a fuller account in Britton's _Memoir\r\nof Aubrey_, 1845, pp. 87-91. Mr. Britton, however, strange to say, was\r\nnot aware that the volumes had been for nine years in safe custody in\r\nthe Bodleian, and consequently deplores their unfortunate disappearance!\r\nHe describes their contents from an abstract in the Gough collection.\r\n\r\n[329] An account of Mr. Boucher, who quitted America on account of his\r\nroyalist principles, and afterwards was Head-Master of a well-known\r\nschool at Cheam, will be found in _Notes and Queries_ for 1866, vol. ix.\r\npp. 75, 282.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1837.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent series of historical prints and drawings which is\r\ncalled, from the name of its collectors and its donor, the Sutherland\r\ncollection, was presented to the University on May 4 in this year,\r\nalthough it was not actually deposited in the Library until March,\r\n1839[330]. The six volumes of the folio editions of Clarendon's _History\r\nof the Rebellion_ and _Life_, and of Burnet's _Own Times_, are inlaid\r\nand bound in sixty-one elephant folio volumes, and illustrated with the\r\nenormous number of 19,224 portraits of every person and views of every\r\nplace in any way mentioned in the text, or connected with its\r\nsubject-matter[331]. The gathering was commenced in 1795 by Alexander\r\nHendras Sutherland, Esq., F.S.A.; on his death (May 21, 1820) it was\r\ntaken up by his widow[332], who spared neither labour nor money to\r\nrender it as complete as possible, and by whom its contents were,\r\nconsequently, nearly doubled. At length, desiring, in accordance with\r\nher husband's will, that the results of her own and his labour should be\r\nalways preserved intact, Mrs. Sutherland presented the whole collection\r\nto the Bodleian. Its extent may be in some degree appreciated when it is\r\nmentioned that there are (according to Mrs. Sutherland's statement in\r\nthe preface to the Supplementary Catalogue) 184 portraits of James I, of\r\nwhich 135 are distinct plates; 743 of Charles I, of which 573 are\r\ndistinct plates, besides sixteen drawings; 373 of Cromwell (253 plates);\r\n552 of Charles II (428 plates); 276 of James II; 175 of Mary II (143\r\nplates); and 431 of William III, of which 363 are separate plates[333].\r\nThere are also 309 views of London and 166 of Westminster. Amongst those\r\nof London is a drawing on many sheets, by a Dutch artist, Antonio van\r\nden Wyngaerde, executed between 1558-1563. It affords a view which\r\nextends from the Palace at Westminster to that at Greenwich, both\r\nincluded; and comprehends also Lambeth Palace and part of Southwark,\r\nwith the palace there of the Protector Somerset, in which the Mint was\r\nsituated. The whole amount expended on the formation of the series is\r\nestimated at £20,000.\r\n\r\nThe collection is accompanied by a handsomely printed Catalogue,\r\ncompiled by Mrs. Sutherland, and published in 1837 in three volumes\r\nquarto, two containing the portraits, and one the topography[334]. A\r\nSupplement to this was printed in the following year, in the preface to\r\nwhich Mrs. Sutherland records her transfer of the collection. She adds\r\nthat 'the University of Oxford, by the manner in which it has received\r\nthe collection, has afforded her the high gratification of witnessing\r\nthe fulfilment, in their utmost extent, of the wishes of its founder;\r\nand in the liberal step which its future conservators have taken, to\r\ninsure a direct and easy means of reference to the prints, she finds\r\nproof of their intention to comply with her own earnest desire, that the\r\nbooks should be as freely open to those really interested in them as may\r\nbe consistent with their safe preservation. Under the superintendence of\r\nthe compiler, but at the expense of the University, a copy of the\r\nCatalogue has been prepared, in which every print is marked with the\r\npage which it respectively fills in the volumes; by means of this, every\r\ndifficulty of reference, and every doubt as to the print intended to be\r\ndescribed, is obviated, and the manuscript indices will be preserved\r\nfrom the injury of constant use. In order to prevent the possibility of\r\ndisappointment in referring from this marked catalogue, every print\r\n(with four exceptions only) of which the page has not been ascertained,\r\nhas been struck out, although probably several of the portraits not at\r\npresent found are still in the volumes.' The following letter of thanks\r\nwas addressed by Convocation to the donor[335]:--\r\n\r\n    'To Mrs. Sutherland, of Merrow, in the County of Surrey.\r\n\r\n    'MADAM,--We, the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University\r\n    of Oxford, feel ourselves called upon to acknowledge, in a public\r\n    and formal manner, the splendid donation recently made by you to our\r\n    Bodleian Library.\r\n\r\n    'It is doubtless a source of much gratification to us that our\r\n    University should have been selected by you as the fittest\r\n    depository of so valuable a collection; but we are not, on that\r\n    account, less disposed to appreciate and admire the feeling which\r\n    has led you to make so considerable a sacrifice, and to relinquish\r\n    the possession of what has been to you, for many years, an object of\r\n    constant interest and occupation.\r\n\r\n    'We shall prize the matchless volumes about to be committed to our\r\n    care, not merely as being embellished with the richest specimens of\r\n    the graphic art, but as possessing a real historical character; as\r\n    enhancing, in no slight degree, the value of works which we have\r\n    long been accustomed to regard as most important contributions to\r\n    the annals and literature of our Country.\r\n\r\n      'Given at our House of Convocation, under our Common Seal, this\r\n      first day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight\r\n      hundred and thirty-seven[336].'\r\n\r\nA few other books were sent by Mrs. Sutherland at the same time,\r\nincluding Boydell's _Shakespeare_, Heath's _Chronicle_, Scott's edition\r\nof Dalrymple's _Preservation of Charles II_, Faber's _Kit-Cat Club_,\r\nWilson's _Catalogue of an Amateur_, &c. And in 1843 she increased her\r\nformer gift by the presentation of copies of a large number of\r\nillustrated, biographical, and historical works, many of which are in a\r\nlike manner enriched with additional engravings. Chief amongst these is\r\na copy of Park's edition of Walpole's _Royal and Noble Authors_,\r\nenlarged from five vols. 8^o. to 20 vols. 4^o. by the insertion of\r\nprints, portraits, and some of the original drawings. Similarly enlarged\r\ncopies of Dr. Dibdin's works are also included; together with framed\r\noil-portraits of Frederic, King of Bohemia, and of Mr. Sutherland.\r\n\r\nA curious collection of rare Dutch tracts, in two vols., printed at\r\nAmsterdam between 1637 and 1664, and relating to English, Irish, and\r\nScottish affairs, chiefly during the Civil Wars, was bought for £2\r\n13_s._ And an enormous gathering of English pamphlets, on every kind of\r\nsubject, in prose and verse, between about 1600 and 1820, said to number\r\n19,380 articles, and which had accumulated in the stores of the\r\nwell-known bookseller, Mr. Thomas Rodd, was bought of him for £101\r\n14_s._ 6_d._ These exceeding, from their number, the powers of the then\r\nvery slender staff of the Library for arrangement and cataloguing,\r\nremained piled up in cupboards for about twenty-five years. But a\r\ngeneral clearance out of all neglected corners taking place on the\r\nappointment of the present Librarian to the Headship, they were then\r\nsorted (to a certain extent), bound, numbered, and incorporated in the\r\ngeneral Catalogue; when they proved to be a valuable addition to the\r\npamphlet-literature, comparatively few of them being found to be\r\nduplicates.\r\n\r\n_Shakespeare_; _Romeo and Juliet._ See 1834.\r\n\r\n_Sanscrit MSS._ See 1842.\r\n\r\nA grant was made by Convocation of £400 annually, for five years,\r\ntowards the expense of the new Catalogue, the printing of which was\r\ncommenced in the summer. A statute also was passed providing that there\r\nshould be two 'ministri,' or assistants, with salaries regulated by the\r\nCurators.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Herbert Hill, M.A., Fellow of New College, was approved by\r\nConvocation, on Oct. 26, as Sub-librarian, in the room of Mr. Cureton,\r\nwho removed in this year to the British Museum. Mr. Hill, however, only\r\nheld the office for one year. And Mr. Richard Firth, New College (B.A.\r\n1839, M.A. 1849, now, and from 1850, a Chaplain in the diocese of\r\nMadras), became _minister_ in the room of Mr. F. J. Marshall, New\r\nCollege (B.A. 1834, M.A. 1837, Chaplain of New College, deceased 1843),\r\nwho had probably entered the Library in 1834 in the place of Mr. Etty.\r\n\r\n[330] MS. note by Mrs. Sutherland in the Library copy of her catalogue.\r\n\r\n[331] As early as 1819 the collection numbered 10,000 prints, bound in\r\n57 volumes. Clarke's _Repert. Bibliogr._ pp. 574-577.\r\n\r\n[332] Mrs. Sutherland died March 18, 1852.\r\n\r\n[333] In Mrs. Sutherland's own copy of the catalogue (now in the\r\npossession of E. L. Hussey, Esq., Oxford), some of these numbers are\r\nenlarged in MS. as follows: Charles II, 557, being 432 plates; Cromwell,\r\n379, 255 plates; William III, 436, 367 plates. Amongst the portraits,\r\nthere are frequently numerous copies of the same plate, being\r\nimpressions in all its different states. In a few instances\r\n(particularly with regard to Charles I) some of the prints entered in\r\nthe catalogue have not been found in the volumes.\r\n\r\n[334] Ten copies were printed of a larger and finer edition, for\r\npresentation to various Libraries, but as only four of these (Bodleian,\r\nCambridge University, British Museum, and Bibl. Royale, Paris)\r\nacknowledged the gift (the letters from which are preserved in one copy\r\nof the catalogue), no more than five copies were printed of the\r\nSupplement. Consequently those Libraries which did not return thanks for\r\nthe gift have now an imperfect book.\r\n\r\n[335] It is here printed from the original (written in the beautifully\r\nneat hand of the late Registrar, Dr. Bliss,) which is now in the\r\npossession of a nephew of Mrs. Sutherland, Edw. Law Hussey, Esq., of\r\nOxford, M.R.C.S. It is sealed with the old University seal, described on\r\np. 1 of these _Annals_, enclosed in a gold box. The late Rev. R. Hussey,\r\nRegius Professor of Ecclesiastical History, was one of the brothers of\r\nMrs. Sutherland.\r\n\r\n[336] A very erroneous notice of the collection, written in a singularly\r\ndepreciatory tone, was inserted in an article in the _Quarterly Review_,\r\nin 1852, vol. xci. p. 217. The writer appears to have confounded the\r\nfacts connected with Gough's preference of the Bodleian to the British\r\nMuseum (as told in Nichols' _Lit. Hist._), or possibly Douce's, with the\r\ntotally different circumstances of Mrs. Sutherland's gift, whose husband\r\nhad left the collection entirely at her disposal, provided only that it\r\nwere not dispersed.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1838.\r\n\r\nOne of the 'curiosities of literature' was obtained by the purchase (for\r\n£10 10_s._) of the _System of Divinity, in a Course of Sermons on the\r\nfirst Institutions of Religion_, by Rev. Will. Davy, A.B., Vicar of\r\nLustleigh, Devon. It is a work in twenty-six volumes, of which only\r\nfourteen copies were printed, entirely by the hands of the indefatigable\r\nauthor himself, between the years 1795 and 1807. It is very roughly\r\nexecuted, the author having purchased only just so much old and worn-out\r\ntype, as sufficed for the printing of two pages at once; accomplishing\r\nin this way the work upon which he had set his heart, 'arte meâ, diurno\r\nnocturnoque labore' (as he says in a Latin preface), in consequence of\r\nhaving failed to procure in any other way the publication of his book.\r\nThe copy in our Library is distinguished by having many additions\r\ninserted, printed (in many cases with later and better type) upon small\r\nslips[337].\r\n\r\nA set of the _Monthly Review_, from the commencement to 1828, in 200\r\nvolumes, in which the names of the contributors are appended in MS. to\r\ntheir several articles, together with a volume of Correspondence with\r\nthe Editor, Ralph Griffiths, LL.D., between 1758 and 1802 (now numbered\r\nBodl. MS. Addit. VII. D. 11), was bought for £42.\r\n\r\nAmong the donations were: 1. A collection of twenty-one Oriental works,\r\nprinted between 1808-1835 by the East India Company, presented by the\r\nDirectors, and, 2. A valuable series, MS. and printed, of the Statutes\r\nof various Italian cities, presented by George Bowyer, Esq. (the present\r\nbaronet, who succeeded to the title in 1860), who also in the years\r\n1839, 1842, and 1843, forwarded large additions to the printed series.\r\nThese volumes are now kept distinct as a separate collection. Altogether\r\nthere are seventy-eight printed volumes, besides four MSS.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 15, a Statute was approved by Convocation which raised the\r\nstipend of the Sub-librarians from £150 to £250.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1825 an annual folio Catalogue had been printed,\r\ncontaining, in one list, all the accessions accruing in each year from\r\npurchases, gifts, and the supply of new publications from Stationers'\r\nHall. The issue of these lists was discontinued after the appearance of\r\nthat for the years 1837 and 1838 jointly; except that in 1843 one for\r\nthat year was printed in octavo.\r\n\r\nA form of declaration and promise for due use of the privilege of\r\nadmission to the Library, to be made by all graduates upon taking their\r\nfirst degree, in lieu of the oath formerly required, was approved by\r\nConvocation, on June 9[338]. In accordance with this form, which is\r\nstill used, each graduate now promises: 'Me libros cæterumque cultum sic\r\ntractaturum ut superesse quam diutissime possint, et, quantum in me est,\r\ncuraturum ne quid Bibliotheca detrimenti aut incommodi capiat.' The same\r\ndeclaration is subscribed in the Library by all non-graduates who are\r\nadmitted to read there, with the addition of a promise that they will\r\ndevote their attention 'ad studia et silentium.' The statutable penalty\r\nfor any wilful mutilation or abstraction of any book, or portion of a\r\nbook, is immediate expulsion from the Library and University, 'sine ulla\r\nspe regressûs.'\r\n\r\nOn the resignation of Rev. H. Hill, Sub-librarian, in this year, he was\r\nsucceeded by Rev. H. O. Coxe, M.A., of Worcester College, who had\r\npreviously worked for five years and a-half in the Department of MSS. in\r\nthe British Museum[339]. Mr. Coxe's nomination was approved by\r\nConvocation on Nov. 16.\r\n\r\n[337] Mr. Davy has had a rival, with much more success, within late\r\nyears in the Rev. Thos. R. Brown, M.A., Vicar of Southwick,\r\nNorthamptonshire. The Library possesses three works written and printed\r\nby this gentleman in his own house. The first is entitled, _A Grammar of\r\nthe Hebrew Hieroglyphs applied to the S. Scriptures, containing the\r\nHistory of the Creation of the Universe and the Fall of Man_, 8^o.\r\n1840. This appears to have been partly _composed_ in type, literally as\r\nwell as technically, for the author says that 'a considerable part of\r\nthe mental composition is coeval with' the manual labour, which last was\r\nentirely performed by himself. A second book appeared in 1841, _Elements\r\nof Sanscrit Grammar_. A third, _A Dictionary, containing English Words\r\nof difficult Etymology_, tracing them chiefly to Sanscrit roots,\r\nappeared in two vols. 8^o. 1843. Of this the author certifies that\r\nonly nine copies were printed, and the one now in the Library was bought\r\nof Mr. Lilly (who had it from the author) for £5 5_s._ in 1855. The\r\nexecution of all these volumes does the reverend printer great credit.\r\nThe Rev. Dr. J. A. Giles had also a private press for some time in his\r\nhouse at Bampton, Oxon., which he taught some of the village children to\r\nwork, and from which issued some of the publications of the Caxton\r\nSociety, but the results were anything but satisfactory, although\r\nprobably quite as good as could be expected from such juvenile\r\ncompositors.\r\n\r\n[338] A previous proposal of this alteration had been rejected by\r\nConvocation on March 17, 1836.\r\n\r\n[339] Mr. Coxe had a considerable share in the compilation of the folio\r\ncatalogue of the Arundel MSS. preserved in the Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1839.\r\n\r\nAn application was made by Magdalen College for the return of a copy of\r\nthe Statutes of the College, found among the Rawlinson MSS., but it was\r\nrefused by the Curators, on the ground that sufficient evidence was not\r\nproduced of its having ever been the property of the College.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1840.\r\n\r\nNinety specimens of the Aldine press, together with other volumes\r\nchiefly printed at Venice by A. de Asula, were purchased at the sale of\r\nthe library of Dr. Samuel Butler, Bishop of Lichfield. From the same\r\nlibrary was purchased, in the following year, a collection of portions\r\nof more than twenty of the very earliest editions of Donatus' _De Octo\r\nPartibus Orationis_, many of which were unknown; these had previously\r\ncome from the library of Dr. Kloss. A ninth-century MS. of St. Gregory's\r\n_Sacramentary_ was purchased for £63; and early MSS. of Juvenal, Lucan,\r\n&c. A fine and perfect copy of Caxton's _Dictes and Sayinges of the\r\nPhilosophres_, printed in 1477, was purchased for £50. It had previously\r\nbeen sold, at Dr. Vincent's sale in 1816, for £99 15_s._; this sum,\r\nwhich is marked in pencil on a fly-leaf, having been altered by some\r\npractical joker, by the insertion of a figure, to £199 15_s._, Mr.\r\nBlades has in consequence recorded that as being the price at which the\r\nLibrary secured the volume[340].\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Rob. J. M'Ghee, Rector of Holywell, Hunts, deposited in the\r\nBodleian (as also in the University Library, Cambridge, and in that of\r\nTrinity College, Dublin,) a collection of thirty-one volumes relating to\r\nthe controversy with the Church of Rome, and to the Moral Theology\r\ntaught at Maynooth. The volumes consist of editions of the Douay and\r\nRheims versions, of some Irish diocesan Statutes, of Bailly's _Theologia\r\nMoralis_, and Delahogue's Dogmatic Treatises, and of various Irish\r\npolemical pamphlets; and they are enclosed in a mahogany case, with\r\nglass door. In consequence of reference having been made to this\r\ncollection by the donor, at a County Meeting held at Huntingdon, Dec.\r\n28, 1850, upon the occasion of the 'Papal Aggression,' some slight\r\ndegree of public attention was called to it; and a controversial volume\r\nwas in consequence published by Mr. M'Ghee, in 1852, entitled, _The\r\nChurch of Rome; a Report on the Books and Documents on the Papacy,\r\ndeposited in the University Library, Cambridge_, &c.\r\n\r\n_Shakespeare_; _Richard III_ and _Hamlet_. See 1834.\r\n\r\nThe first non-academic _minister_ was appointed in Mr. H. S. Harper\r\n(_vice_ Mr. Firth), of whose valuable services and acquaintance with\r\ndetails the Library still enjoys the benefit. Mr. Harper had acted for\r\nthree years previously as an under-assistant.\r\n\r\n[340] As Mr. Blades' valuable work on _The Life and Typography of\r\nCaxton_, 1863, gives most accurate descriptions of all the copies and\r\nfragments of our great printer's works which are preserved in the\r\nLibrary, it is only necessary to refer the reader to it for detailed\r\ninformation. A notice of two, however, which were unknown to be Caxtons\r\nat the time of Mr. Blades' investigations, will be found in the account\r\nof Bishop Tanner's books, p. 155; and two fragments, among Douce's\r\nbooks, are mentioned at p. 250.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1841.\r\n\r\nThe very large and valuable MS. collections of the Rev. John Brickdale\r\nBlakeway, relating to the history of Shropshire, were presented by his\r\nwidow. Mr. Blakeway was minister of St. Mary's Church, Shrewsbury, for\r\nthirty-two years, and died March 10, 1826. He was long engaged in\r\ngathering materials for a county history, and his collections now form\r\nfifteen closely-written volumes in folio, nine in quarto, and two in\r\noctavo, arranged, and lettered on their backs, according to their\r\nseveral subjects, viz. Pedigrees, County History, Parochial History, &c.\r\nA list of them is given at the end of the Annual Catalogue. They were\r\nsupplemented in 1850 by the purchase (for £42) of a copy of Mr. T. F.\r\nDukes' _Antiquities of Shropshire_ (4^o. Shrewsbury, 1844), divided into\r\ntwo large volumes, and enriched by the author with many MS. additions\r\nand copies of ancient deeds, and with upwards of 700 portraits and\r\noriginal drawings of churches, fonts, &c. relating to almost every\r\nparish in the county. As Mr. Blakeway's collections are not accompanied\r\nwith engravings or drawings, these volumes largely assist to make the\r\nmaterials for the history of this county complete.\r\n\r\nA parcel of 136 early French and Anglo-Saxon coins was presented by Her\r\nMajesty the Queen, out of a mass of upwards of 6700 which were found in\r\ndigging at the bank of the river Ribble, at Cuerdale, in Lancashire, and\r\nwere adjudged to belong to Her Majesty in right of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster. The largest part of the Saxon coins were of the reigns of S.\r\nEdmund of East Anglia (in number 1770) and of Alfred (793); of the\r\nContinental, of Charles le Chauve (712) and, apparently, of Charles le\r\nSimple (2942).\r\n\r\nSome rare and interesting books issued by English printers about the\r\nmiddle of the sixteenth century were acquired in this year; among them,\r\nthe _Boke of Common Prayer_, printed by Oswen, at Worcester, in 1552,\r\nbought for the very moderate sum of £3 16_s._ Two rare American Psalters\r\nwere purchased, the one called _The Massachuset Psalter_, printed at\r\nBoston in 1709, for £2, and the other, the Psalms in blank verse with\r\ntunes, printed at Boston in 1718, for £1 19_s._\r\n\r\n_Shakespeare_, _Henry VI._ See 1834.\r\n\r\n_American Tracts._ See 1836.\r\n\r\n_Donatus._ See 1840.\r\n\r\nThe hitherto somewhat narrow funds of the Library received in this year\r\na welcome increase by the bequest of the large sum of £36,000 in the\r\nThree per Cents. from Rev. Robert Mason, D.D., of Queen's College,\r\ndeceased Jan. 5. He bequeathed also a further sum of £30,000 for a new\r\nlibrary to his own College. In commemoration of this munificent legacy,\r\none room, devoted to the reception of costly illustrated works, and\r\nworks of some degree of value or rarity in various languages, has been\r\nstyled the _Mason Room_ (see p. 251). The elegant model of the Church of\r\nthe Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, now exhibited in the Library, came by\r\nhis bequest, together with a painting of the Zodiac of Tentyra, in\r\nEgypt, which is hung in the Picture Gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1842.\r\n\r\nSeven Sanscrit MSS. had been given to the Library in 1837 by B. H.\r\nHodgson, Esq., the British Resident in Nepaul, before which time there\r\nwere but a very few works in that language scattered through some of the\r\nvarious Oriental collections, and most of them recently acquired[341].\r\nBut in this year the real foundation of the present very large and\r\nvaluable collection was laid, by the purchase for £500 of the MSS.\r\nobtained by Professor H. H. Wilson (_dec._ May 8, 1860) during his\r\nresidence in India, numbering 616 works and 540 volumes, of which 147\r\nare MSS. of the Vedas. A brief list of them is attached to the Annual\r\nCatalogue for 1842, and the whole are fully described in the catalogue\r\nof the Sanscrit MSS., compiled by Theod. Aufrecht, M.A., now Professor\r\nof Sanscrit in the Univ. of Edinburgh, the second and last part of which\r\nwas published in 1864. The greater part of Mr. Wilson's collection\r\nconsists of MSS. written in the last and present centuries.\r\n\r\nSome small collections towards the history of Cheshire, made by Rev. F.\r\nGower, were purchased in this year and in 1846.\r\n\r\nIn printed books the chief purchase was a copy (at the price of fifty\r\nguineas) of the original and hitherto unknown edition of the poems of\r\nDrummond, of Hawthornden. It is in quarto, with a portrait, having the\r\nletter-press only on one side of the page, and was printed at Edinburgh\r\nby Andro Hart in 1614. There are three or four small corrections in\r\nDrummond's own handwriting[342].\r\n\r\n_Bowyer._ _Italian Municipal Statutes._ See 1838.\r\n\r\n_Laing._ _Almanac by W. de Worde._ See 1755.\r\n\r\n_Old Plays._ See 1834.\r\n\r\nIn March, Mr. J. B. Taunton, All Souls' College (B.A. 1843, M.A. 1848),\r\nwas appointed Assistant _vice_ Mr. F. E. Thurland, New College (B.A.\r\n1841, M.A. 1846, now Rector of Thurstaston, Cheshire), who was made an\r\n_extra_, in the place of Mr. Symonds, resigned. Mr. Thurland had,\r\nprobably, succeeded Mr. Grove in 1838 or 1839.\r\n\r\nThe stipend of the Librarian was increased by £150, by a statute which\r\npassed on May 6. By the same statute an annual payment was ordered of\r\n£20 to the Janitor, in lieu of fees hitherto taken for showing the\r\nLibrary or Picture Gallery to Members of the University. These,\r\nundergraduates as well as graduates, have now, if wearing their\r\nacademical dress, the right of free entrance for themselves and friends;\r\nother visitors are admitted, by a regulation made five or six years ago,\r\nat the very moderate fee of threepence each person. (See p. 134.)\r\n\r\n[341] The gift of the first Sanscrit book (described in the\r\nBenefaction-Register as being 'Gentuanâ linguâ') by one John _Ken_, in\r\n1666, is noticed at p. 113. The book is now numbered, Walker 214.\r\n\r\n[342] A copy of Blackwood's _Martyre de la Royne d'Escosse_ (Edinb.\r\n1587), among Rawlinson's books, has an autograph of Drummond: 'Gŭi.\r\nDrŭ[=m]ond, a Paris, 1607.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1843.\r\n\r\nThe valuable collection of Oriental MSS. formed by the celebrated\r\ntraveller, James Bruce, of Kinnaird, was purchased for £1000. It\r\nconsists of ninety-six volumes, of which twenty-six are in Ethiopic, and\r\nseventy in Arabic; there is also one Coptic MS. on papyrus. Included in\r\nvol. iv. of an Ethiopic copy of the Old Testament is one of the three\r\ncopies of the Book of Enoch, which were brought by Bruce from Abyssinia,\r\nand which were then (if they be not even still) the only manuscripts of\r\nthe book to be found in Europe. One of the three had been given by Bruce\r\nhimself to the University, in 1788, through the hands of Dr. Douglas,\r\nBishop of Salisbury; it is written on forty leaves of vellum, in triple\r\ncolumns, and is now exhibited in the glass case near the entrance of the\r\nLibrary. It was from this MS. that Dr. Laurence, afterwards Archbishop\r\nof Cashel, first made the translation which he published in 1821, and\r\nthen subsequently, in 1838, published the original text. The second copy\r\n('elegantissimum et celeberrimum') was given by Bruce to Louis XVI, and\r\nis now in the Imperial Library at Paris. By the purchase of the third,\r\nthe Bodleian is, therefore, the possessor of two out of the three.\r\n\r\nTwo unsuccessful attempts had previously been made to dispose of the\r\ncollection by auction. It was first announced for sale by Mr. Christie,\r\nfor May 17, 1827, to be disposed of in one lot; and a list was issued,\r\nabridged from the catalogue made by Dr. Alex. Murray, the editor of\r\nBruce's _Travels_. The issue of this proposed sale is recorded by Douce\r\nin the following MS. note on his copy of the auction catalogue: 'These\r\nMSS. were put in by the owner at £5500, and after an elaborate eulogium\r\non them by Mr. Christie, no bidding or advance took place, and they were\r\nof course withdrawn. Had the owner offered them for £500, I should think\r\nthe same result would have happened.' The second attempt was made in\r\n1842, when the MSS. were offered for sale by Mr. George Robins, on May\r\n30, but it appears that even all the eloquence of that most moving of\r\nauctioneers failed to elicit a bid corresponding to the expectation of\r\nthe seller; and so the collection fortunately remained intact, to be\r\ndisposed of to our Library in the year following.\r\n\r\nA catalogue of the Ethiopic MSS. of the collection was issued in a small\r\nquarto volume (eighty-seven pages), in 1848, as part vii. of the General\r\nCatalogue of MSS. It was compiled by a German scholar, well acquainted\r\nwith this branch of Oriental literature, Dr. A. Dillmann, and contains,\r\nbesides Bruce's books, three of Pococke's MSS., one of Laud's, one of\r\nClarke's, and three others; in all thirty-five.\r\n\r\nValuable materials for the history of Devon were secured by the purchase\r\n(for £90) of the collections made for that purpose by Jeremiah Milles,\r\nD.D., Dean of Exeter, and Pres. of the Soc. of Antiquaries. The library\r\nof Dean Milles (who died Feb. 13, 1784) was sold by auction by Mr. Leigh\r\nSotheby, in April; and these collections, comprised in eighteen volumes\r\nin folio, one in quarto, and one in octavo, formed a principal feature\r\nin the sale.\r\n\r\nIn this year the new Catalogue of the general Library of printed books,\r\nexclusive of the Gough and Douce libraries, and the collections of\r\nHebrew books and Dissertations, of which already special catalogues were\r\nin print, was completed and published in three folio volumes. It had\r\nbeen commenced in the year 1837, and was prepared by the Rev. Arthur\r\nBrowne, M.A., Chaplain of Ch. Ch. (now a retired Chaplain of the Royal\r\nNavy), whose share comprises the letters P-R, and the commencement of S;\r\nthe Rev. Henry Cary, M.A. (son of the Translator of _Dante_, then\r\nIncumbent of St. Paul's, Oxford, but now, by returning to his previous\r\nprofession of the Law, a barrister in Australia), who is responsible for\r\nthe letters F-K, and part of L; and Rev. Alfred Hackman, M.A., Chaplain\r\nand Precentor of Ch. Ch., and now Sub-librarian, who completed the\r\ngreater part of it, viz. the letters A-E, L (from _London_)-O, S (from\r\n_Shakespeare_)-Z. The whole charges of the printing of the Catalogue\r\namounted to £2990 12_s._[343]; the previous cost of compilation was\r\nabout £2000.\r\n\r\n_Bowyer._ _Italian Municipal Statutes._ See 1838.\r\n\r\n_Sutherland._ _Illustrated Books._ See 1839.\r\n\r\n[343] MS. note by Dr. Bliss.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1844.\r\n\r\nSir William Ouseley, the editor of the three volumes entitled _Oriental\r\nCollections_ (brother to Sir Gore Ouseley, whom he accompanied when he\r\nwent as ambassador to Persia in 1810), gathered, during some forty years\r\nspent in accumulation, about 750 Oriental MSS., chiefly in Persian, but\r\nincluding also a few in Arabic, Sanscrit, Zend, &c. Of these, in 1831 a\r\ncatalogue (in 24 pp. quarto) was issued by the owner, who wished to\r\ndispose of them collectively, but no purchaser was then found, and they\r\nconsequently remained in Sir William's possession. After his death,\r\nhowever (in Sept. 1842), they were again proposed for sale _en masse_,\r\nand the Library became a purchaser in this year for the sum of £2000.\r\nMany of the volumes are specimens of the best styles of Persian writing\r\nand illumination, while others are of great antiquity and rarity. The\r\nprinted Oriental collection was also increased by various works printed\r\nin the East Indies in 1830-1839, which were presented by the Asiatic\r\nSociety of Bengal, and by some Sanscrit and Mahratta books given by Rev.\r\nG. Pigott, Chaplain at Bombay.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1845.\r\n\r\nThis year is rendered noticeable in the later annals of the Library by\r\nthe fact that not a single MS. was purchased during its course. But a\r\nvery valuable collection of Arabic, Persian and Sanscrit MSS. formed by\r\nBrigadier Gen. Alex. Walker, during his service in India, was presented\r\nby his son, Sir Will. Walker, of Edinburgh[344]. These are kept as a\r\ndistinct collection, like other donations or purchases of similar\r\nextent; the Sanscrit portion is described in the catalogue compiled by\r\nProf. Aufrecht. The collection of printed Hebrew books was increased by\r\nthe purchase (for £176 14_s._ 6_d._) of 483 volumes from the library of\r\nthe celebrated lexicographer, Gesenius, of Halle, who died Oct. 23,\r\n1842, and whose library was sold by auction at Halle, in Jan. 1844. Two\r\ncurious collections of tracts were also bought; the one in English\r\nconsisting of 300 volumes, ranging from 1688 to 1766, and chiefly\r\ntreating of the case of the Non-jurors, the Bangorian controversy, and\r\nthe affairs of the city of London (for £22 10_s._); and the other in\r\nFrench, consisting only of four small volumes, but containing a very\r\nlarge number of '_Merveilles_,' strange histories of strange wonders,\r\nbetween 1557 and 1637, of great rarity and singularity. These were\r\nobtained at the sale of the library of Mr. Benj. Heywood Bright, No.\r\n3796, for £13.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 23, the present writer (then a Clerk of Magdalen College) was\r\nappointed Assistant, _vice_ Mr. Taunton, after upwards of five years'\r\nprevious service as a supernumerary, having first entered the Library in\r\nJune, 1840.\r\n\r\n[344] Gen. Walker, who in the beginning of the century was Governor of\r\nBaroda, in Guzerat, died at Edinburgh in 1832. His MSS., in the words of\r\nProf. Aufrecht, 'integritate et antiquitate eminent.'\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1846.\r\n\r\nThe original MS., or first copy, of Wood's _History and Antiquities of\r\nOxford_, in English, was purchased for the moderate sum of £8 8_s._\r\nAlready the Library possessed the corrected copy, in the author's\r\nautograph, in two large folio volumes, which had formed part of his\r\ncollection in the Ashmolean Museum, but were transferred to the\r\nBodleian as early as the year 1769. The volume now obtained had been in\r\nthe possession of Edw. Roberts, Esq., of Ealing, a letter to whom from\r\nMr. Joseph Parker, of Oxford, is inserted, dated July 4, 1827, in which\r\nhe mentions the sale of the book to Mr. B. Roberts, and says that it was\r\npurchased at a sale at Burford, in 1797 or 1798.\r\n\r\nA curious and valuable account-roll of Sir John Williams, Knt., Master\r\nof the Jewels to Henry VIII, which specifies all the treasures which\r\nwere in his custody, was bought for £25[345].\r\n\r\nThe department of Italian topography, antiquities and art was largely\r\nenriched by the purchase from Rev. R. A. Scott (for £234 6_s._) of a\r\ncollection of 1426 volumes made by his brother the late George C. Scott,\r\nEsq., during ten years' residence in Italy.\r\n\r\n_Dissertations._ See 1828.\r\n\r\n_Gower's Cheshire._ See 1842.\r\n\r\n_Thorkelin._ See 1828.\r\n\r\n[345] An original account, by the same Master of the Jewels, of the\r\nplate and jewels received for the King's use from dissolved monasteries\r\nin the years 1540-1542, is preserved in MS. _e Musæo_, 57.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1847.\r\n\r\nA valuable MS. of Star-Chamber Reports, from June 17, 1635, to June 4,\r\n1638, was purchased for £11. Several similar volumes of Reports are\r\namong the Rawlinson MSS. Two curious collections of pamphlets were\r\nbought; the one consisting of tracts, broadsides and proclamations\r\nrelating to the Gunpowder Plot, made by H. Glynn, Under-secretary of\r\nState (£12 10_s._); the other, a series of State special Forms of\r\nPrayer, from 1665 to 1840 (£10 10_s._)\r\n\r\nWorks relating to the history of America, in which the Library is now\r\nvery rich, begin in this year to form a specially noticeable feature in\r\nthe catalogue of purchases. Many rare tracts had been of old in the\r\nLibrary, but much of the completeness of the present collection is due\r\nto the energy of the well-known American bibliophilist, Henry Stevens,\r\nEsq.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1848.\r\n\r\nA collection of Hebrew MSS., numbering 862 volumes and nearly 1300\r\nseparate works, was purchased at Hamburgh for £1030. It had been amassed\r\nby Heimann Joseph Michael (born Apr. 12, 1792, deceased June 10, 1846),\r\nwho had devoted thirty years to the formation of his library. One\r\nhundred and ten vellum MSS. are included in it, written for the most\r\npart between 1240 and 1450. Michael's printed books amounted to 5471;\r\nthese were purchased by the British Museum. A short catalogue of the\r\ncollection, drawn up from the owner's papers, was issued at Hamburgh in\r\n1848, with a preface by Dr. L. Zunz, and an index to the MSS. by Dr. M.\r\nSteinschneider. They will ere long be re-catalogued, together with all\r\nthe other Hebrew MSS. in the Library, by Dr. Neubauer, who has now, in\r\nthe present year, commenced his important task.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1849.\r\n\r\nThe valuable collection of Oriental MSS. formed by Rev. W. H. Mill,\r\nD.D., Regius Professor of Hebrew at Cambridge, during his residence in\r\nIndia as Principal of Bishop's College, Calcutta, was purchased from him\r\nfor £350. A small remaining portion of his collection, comprising\r\nthirty-six volumes, was bought in 1858, after his death, for £35. In all\r\nthere are 160 volumes, of which 145 are in Sanscrit. These latter are\r\nfully described in Prof. Aufrecht's Sanscrit Catalogue.\r\n\r\nThe chief purchases of printed books were made at the sale at Berlin, in\r\nMay, of the library of Professor C. F. G. Jacobs, the editor of the\r\n_Anthologia Græca_ (who died March 30, 1847), whence a large number of\r\nclassical dissertations, many of them authors' presentation copies, were\r\nobtained[346], and at the sale of the library of Rev. Hen. Francis Lyte\r\n(deceased 1847) which took place in July. A collection of 360 sermons,\r\npublished by Non-juring divines between 1688 and 1750, is an interesting\r\nitem in the year's list; another is a copy of Pliny's _Historia\r\nNaturalis_, printed at Rome by Sweynheym and Pannartz in 1473, with a\r\nMS. collation of three very early codices made by Ang. Politian in 1490,\r\nwhich was bought for £21, at an extremely curious sale at Messrs. Leigh\r\nSotheby's, in Feb., of books 'selected from the library of an eminent\r\nliterary character' (M. Libri?).\r\n\r\nThe two statutable Assistants at this time and for one or two years\r\npreviously were Mr. J. M. Price, All Souls' College (B.A. 1849, M.A.\r\n1852, now Vicar of Cuddington, Bucks,) and Mr. W. W. Garrett, New\r\nCollege (B.A. 1849). The former of these was succeeded about 1850, by\r\nthe last undergraduate Assistant, Mr. J. C. Hyatt, Magd. Hall (B.A.\r\n1852, now Perp. Curate of Queenshead, Yorkshire). Since then, in\r\nconsequence of the difficulty of reconciling attendance on College\r\nlectures, &c. with attention to the continually increasing work of the\r\nLibrary, the junior Assistants have been taken from the City instead of\r\nfrom the undergraduate members of the University, as had been generally\r\nthe case hitherto.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of an address from the House of Commons, Sept. 4, 1848, on\r\nthe motion of Mr. Ewart, various returns relative to public libraries\r\nwere obtained, which were printed by Parliament in 1849, State Paper,\r\nNo. 18. The following is the reply from Dr. Bandinel there printed:--\r\n\r\n    'BODLEIAN LIBRARY,\r\n    '_January_ 9, 1849.\r\n\r\n    'SIR,--In compliance with your letter, dated Oct. 27, 1848, desiring\r\n    certain Returns respecting the Bodleian Library, I have to state--\r\n\r\n    '1. As to the number of books received under the various Copyright\r\n    Acts, no distinct register of the books so received has been kept,\r\n    but they have, at the end of each year, been incorporated into the\r\n    general collection, so that I am unable to give the number of the\r\n    books so received.\r\n\r\n    '2. The number of printed volumes in the Bodleian Library amounts to\r\n    about 220,000; but this statement will very inadequately express the\r\n    real extent of the collection, as so many works have been bound\r\n    together in one volume.\r\n\r\n    '3. The number of manuscripts is about 21,000.\r\n\r\n    '4. All graduates of the University have the right of admission to\r\n    the Library; other persons must apply for admission to the regular\r\n    authorities.\r\n\r\n    '5. No register is kept of persons consulting the Library;\r\n    accordingly, the number of students who have frequented it during\r\n    the last ten years cannot be ascertained.\r\n\r\n                                'I have, &c.\r\n                                    'BULKELEY BANDINEL,\r\n                                        '_Bodleian Librarian_.\r\n\r\n    'George Cornewall Lewis, Esq.,\r\n      'Under-Secretary of State, Whitehall.'\r\n\r\nThe estimate of printed volumes here given is believed to be as nearly\r\naccurate as it was possible to make it, as considerable pains were taken\r\nin forming the calculation. The number of separate printed books and\r\ntracts may be reckoned as at least treble the number of volumes. With\r\nregard to the reply to the fifth enquiry some explanation is requisite.\r\nA register is kept of all the octavo and most of the quarto volumes\r\ntaken out for readers, of all the volumes from special and separate\r\ncollections, and of all the MSS.; but no account is kept of the folios\r\nand other books on the ground-floor of the great room, which are\r\naccessible to readers themselves, and frequently used by them without\r\nthe help of the assistants. Consequently, any return of the number of\r\nreaders entered on the register would not adequately represent the whole\r\nnumber of students who use the Library, although, of course, it would,\r\nwith a margin for allowance, afford a very fair approximation. No\r\nrecord, however, of separate _visits_ of readers is kept, as distinct\r\nfrom the books required; so that although a reader may be at work for\r\ndays or weeks together, yet, if he continue to use only the same books,\r\none entry alone will be made of his name.\r\n\r\n[346] A separate list of the books purchased at Jacobs' sale is appended\r\nto the annual Catalogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1850.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew collection was still further increased in this year by the\r\npurchase of sixty-two MSS., of which fifty-seven had been brought from\r\nItaly; and in 1851, by the purchase of some printed books collected by\r\nDr. Isaac L. Auerbach, of Berlin, who had recently deceased. Every year\r\nabout this time[347] saw additions to this branch of the Library, made\r\nchiefly through the agency of the late Mr. Asher, the well-known Jewish\r\nbookseller of Berlin, and also through the late Hirsch Edelmann, a\r\nlearned Rabbi, who was for years a frequent reader in the Bodleian, from\r\nwhence he commenced the publication of a series of extracts (see under\r\nthe year 1693). Mr. Edelmann died a few years since in Germany. A series\r\nof works illustrating the history, civil and ecclesiastical, the\r\ngeography, &c. of Hungary, Transylvania, Croatia, and other neighbouring\r\nprovinces of the Austrian Empire, amounting to 400 volumes, was\r\npurchased for £78; and a similar but much larger collection, relating to\r\nthe history of Poland, numbering no fewer than 1200 volumes, was\r\npurchased for £366. Three hundred and twenty volumes of early printed\r\nworks, some of which were fine specimens of _incunabula_, were obtained\r\nat the sale of the duplicates from the Royal Library at Munich. It was\r\nannounced at the end of the Annual Catalogue that a special list of\r\nthese, together with a catalogue of the Hebrew MSS. noticed above, and\r\nof the Hungarian and Polish collections, would be printed and circulated\r\nin the following year; this, however, was not done.\r\n\r\nA series of 600 English sermons, printed between 1600 and 1720, bound\r\nseparately, was purchased for £59.\r\n\r\nVarious specimens of the first beginning of printing in one of the\r\nFriendly Islands, Vavau, consisting of the Bible in the Tonga language,\r\nand of several elementary books, were presented by Capt. Sir Jas.\r\nEverard Home, R.N. as also some elementary books printed at Apea by the\r\nnatives, under the direction of the Missionaries, for the use of the\r\nnatives of the Navigators' Islands.\r\n\r\n_Dukes' Shropshire Collections._ See 1841.\r\n\r\n[347] In 1845, about 320 printed volumes were purchased from a catalogue\r\nissued at Berlin by A. Rebenstein, or Bernstein, and D. Cassel.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1851.\r\n\r\nAt the sale of the books of the poet Gray, by Messrs. Sotheby and\r\nWilkinson, on Aug. 28, his copies of Clarendon and of Burnet's _Own\r\nTimes_ (vol. i.), with many MSS. notes written by him in the margins,\r\nwere bought for £49 10_s._ and £2 18_s._ respectively[348]. Perfect\r\nspecimens of facsimiles, which would defy detection, were obtained for\r\nthe completion of the Library copy of Coverdale's Bible; being\r\npen-and-ink copies of the title, from Lord Leicester's copy, and of the\r\nmap of Palestine, from Lord Jersey's copy, executed with admirable skill\r\nby the late well-known facsimilist, Mr. J. Harris.\r\n\r\nA Supplemental Catalogue of the printed books, comprehending all the\r\naccessions which had been made during the years 1835-1847, was published\r\nin this year, in one folio volume, under the editorship of the Rev.\r\nAlfred Hackman, M.A., by whom the greater part of the earlier Catalogue\r\nhad been compiled, as mentioned at p. 268.\r\n\r\nOn March 27, Convocation voted an addition of £50 _per annum_ to the\r\nstipends of the Sub-librarians.\r\n\r\n_Recovery of Pococke MS. 32._ See p. 81.\r\n\r\n_Malone's Correspondence._ See p. 232.\r\n\r\n[348] The Clarendon had been previously sold at an auction on Nov. 29,\r\n1845, by Messrs. Evans, with various other books which had belonged to\r\nGray.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1852.\r\n\r\nIn the Report of the University Commission, which was issued in this\r\nyear, various suggestions were embodied which had been made by several\r\nwitnesses. Sir Edmund Head renewed his plan of allowing books to be\r\ntaken out of the Library by readers, and was supported by the opinions\r\nof Professors Wall and Jowett; but the proposal was met with the strong\r\ncounter-testimony of Mr. H. E. Strickland[349], Prof. Vaughan, Dr. W. A.\r\nGreenhill (at that time a constant reader in the Library), Prof. Donkin,\r\nMr. E. S. Foulkes, and others. And the Commissioners were not prepared\r\nto report in favour of a plan which would at once lessen what was\r\ndescribed as being one of the great advantages of the place, namely, the\r\ncertainty of finding within its walls every book which it possessed. At\r\nthe same time, they were disposed to recommend a relaxation in some\r\ninstances of the strictness of the rule, and concurred in a suggestion\r\nmade by Dr. Macbride and Mr. Storey Maskelyne, that duplicates should be\r\nallowed to circulate. Most, however, of the suggestions for extension of\r\nfacilities to readers, as well as of the reasons alleged for alteration\r\nof system, have now been answered by the opening (through the liberality\r\nof the Radcliffe Trustees) of the Radcliffe Library as a noble\r\nreading-room for both day and evening. As the hours during which the\r\nLibrary may be used extend now, in consequence of this addition, from\r\nnine a.m. to ten p.m., it is at once apparent that the Bodleian presents\r\ngreater advantages to students than can anywhere else be enjoyed; to\r\nwhich is to be added the readiness and quickness (specially testified\r\nto, in 1852, by Dr. Greenhill) with which, under all ordinary\r\ncircumstances, readers are supplied with the books which they require.\r\nThe Commissioners in their Report called attention to a suggestion of\r\nSir Henry Bishop, then Professor of Music, for the establishment of a\r\nclassified musical library, which should comprehend, not merely the\r\nmusic received by the Bodleian from Stationers' Hall, but all superior\r\nforeign music as well, of every school and every age. Such collections\r\nthe Professor said were only to be found at Munich and Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe Report and Evidence upon the recommendations of the Commissioners,\r\nwhich were issued by the Hebdomadal Board in the following year, did not\r\ndiffer widely in testimony or suggestions from those of the Commission.\r\nDr. Pusey and Mr. Marriott agreed in deprecating the allowing removal of\r\nbooks, speaking (as did several of the witnesses before the Commission)\r\nfrom actual experience as constant readers in the place; and Dr.\r\nBandinel mentioned, in a paper of observations which he contributed, the\r\nfact that he had been told by the Librarian of the Advocates' Library at\r\nEdinburgh that between 6,000 and 7,000 volumes appeared to have been\r\nlost there from the facilities afforded to borrowers. A comparative\r\ntabular statement respecting the arrangements and rules of the libraries\r\nat Berlin, Dresden, Florence, Munich, Paris and Vienna, drawn up by Mr.\r\nCoxe from the Parliamentary Report on Libraries, which showed very\r\nfavourably in behalf of the Bodleian, was subjoined by Dr. Bandinel to\r\nhis evidence.\r\n\r\nThe great feature of this year was the acquisition of the Italian\r\nLibrary of the Count Alessandro Mortara, consisting of about 1400\r\nvolumes, choice in character and condition, for £1000. The Count, who\r\nwas distinguished for his literary taste and knowledge of the literature\r\nof his own country, had, although holding the nominal office of Grand\r\nChamberlain to the Duke of Lucca, taken up his abode in Oxford some ten\r\nyears previously, on account of his desire to examine the Canonici MSS.\r\nand of his friendship with Dr. Wellesley, the late Principal of New Inn\r\nHall. He became a daily reader in the Bodleian, where the interest which\r\nhe took in the place, together with his polished, yet genuine, courtesy,\r\nmade him a welcome and popular visitor. It was upon returning to Italy\r\n(where he died, June 14, 1855, at Florence), that he disposed of his\r\nvaluable collection. A catalogue, compiled by himself, with occasional\r\nshort notes, was issued with the purchase-catalogue for the year. He\r\nalso drew up a catalogue of the Italian MSS. in the Canonici collection,\r\nwhich was published, in a quarto volume, in 1864. (See under 1817.)\r\n\r\nAmong miscellaneous purchases were a few volumes which were wanted to\r\nmake the Library set of De Bry's _Voyages_ complete, an imperfect copy\r\nof the Oxford _Liber Festivalis_ (see 1691), and a large collection of\r\nDr. Priestley's writings (believed to have been made by himself), in\r\nthirty-nine vols.\r\n\r\n[349] Several important suggestions were made by this gentleman. One,\r\nthat the Library Books should all be stamped with a distinguishing mark,\r\nis now in process of being carried out. Another, respecting the great\r\nimportance of collecting the most ephemeral local literature, especially\r\nfor the county of Oxford, and of procuring books printed at provincial\r\npresses, relates to a subject which has received much more attention of\r\nlate years than formerly. A third, on the desirability, acknowledged (as\r\nwe have seen) in the last century, of having a general Catalogue\r\ncompiled of the books found in College Libraries which are wanting in\r\nthe Bodleian, has unfortunately as yet seen no accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1853.\r\n\r\nA portion of the collection of Hebrew MSS. formed by Prof. Isaac Sam.\r\nReggio, at Goritz, amounting to about seventy-two volumes, was purchased\r\nfor £108. Many other MSS. in this class of literature occur yearly in\r\nthe accounts at this time. But the great acquisition of 1853 was the\r\n_Breviarium secundum regulam beati Ysidori, dictum Mozarabes_, printed\r\n_on vellum_ at Toledo, by command of Cardinal Ximenes, in 1502. £200\r\nwere given for this book, which is the only vellum copy known, and which\r\nis in most immaculate condition. It is of extreme rarity even on paper,\r\nas it is believed that only thirty-five copies were printed.\r\n\r\nAn imperfect copy of Caxton's _Chronicle_, 1480, was bought for £21; and\r\na large gathering of Norfolk tracts was obtained at the sale of Mr.\r\nDawson Turner's library.\r\n\r\nIt was in this year that Dr. Constantine Simonides visited the Library\r\nin the hope of disposing of some of the products of his Eastern\r\ningenuity, but failed here, as also at the British Museum, although\r\nsuccessful in most other quarters. It is much to be lamented that the\r\ntalent and ability which he undoubtedly possessed in no small degree\r\nwere devoted to such unworthy purpose as his history discloses. The\r\nstory of his interview with Mr. Coxe, then Sub-librarian, is well known,\r\nand was reproduced in an article in the _Cornhill Magazine_ for Oct.\r\n1867 (p. 499); and as the version there given appears to be\r\nsubstantially correct, it will be sufficient to borrow it from its\r\npages:--\r\n\r\n    'On visiting the [Bodleian Library, Mr. Simonides] showed some\r\n    fragments of MSS. to Mr. Coxe, who assented to their belonging to\r\n    the twelfth century. \"And these, Mr. Coxe, belong to the tenth or\r\n    eleventh century?\" \"Yes, probably.\" \"And now, Mr. Coxe, let me show\r\n    you a very ancient and valuable MS. I have for sale, and which ought\r\n    to be in your Library. To what century do you consider this\r\n    belongs?\" \"This, Mr. Simonides, I have no doubt,\" said Mr. Coxe,\r\n    \"belongs to the [latter half of the] nineteenth century.\" The Greek\r\n    and his MS. disappeared.'\r\n\r\nAn account of this visit was given in the _Athenæum_ for March 1, 1856,\r\nand a full narrative, including a letter from Sir F. Madden respecting\r\nthe dealings with Simonides on the part of the British Museum, is to be\r\nfound in S. L. Sotheby's _Principia Typographica_, vol. ii. pp.\r\n133-136f[350].\r\n\r\n[350] The death of Simonides, from the terrible disease of leprosy, was\r\nannounced as having occurred at Cairo in last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1854.\r\n\r\nA very interesting series of eighteen autograph letters from Henry Hyde,\r\nthe second Earl of Clarendon, was presented to the University by 'our\r\nhonoured Lord and Chancellor,' the Earl of Derby[351]. They are best\r\ndescribed in the following letter to the Vice-Chancellor, which\r\naccompanied the gift, and which is now bound in the same volume:--\r\n\r\n    'KNOWSLEY, _Oct._ 17, 1854.\r\n\r\n    'MY DEAR SIR,--In looking over some old papers here the other day, I\r\n    found (how they came here I know not) some original and apparently\r\n    autograph letters, which appeared to me to be curious. They are\r\n    private letters, addressed by Lord Clarendon, to the Earl of\r\n    Abingdon, as Lord Lieutenant of Oxfordshire, during, and on the\r\n    suppression of, the Duke of Monmouth's Rebellion. I have no doubt\r\n    of their genuineness; and if from the connexion of the University\r\n    with the writer[352], as well as the locality, you think they would\r\n    be worth depositing in the Bodleian Library, I shall have great\r\n    pleasure in offering them to the acceptance of the University for\r\n    that purpose; and in that case would send with them a miniature\r\n    pencil drawing of the Duke of Monmouth, which is not too large to be\r\n    let into the cover of the portfolio which should contain the\r\n    letters, and for the authenticity of which I can so far vouch that\r\n    it has been in this house since 1729, at least; since it appears in\r\n    a catalogue of the pictures and engravings here which formed the\r\n    collection at that time.\r\n\r\n    'I am, my dear sir,\r\n        'Yours sincerely,\r\n            'DERBY.'\r\n\r\nThe portrait in question, which is a beautifully executed drawing, in an\r\noak frame, marked on the back, 'Duke of Monmouth, by Foster,' is now\r\nfixed, as desired, in the present morocco binding of the volume.\r\n\r\nA collection of early editions of the Prayer-Book (including\r\nWhitchurch's May and June editions of 1549 and that of 1552), of the\r\nMetrical Psalter, and of Visitation Articles (amongst others, Edward the\r\nSixth's Articles of 1547, and Injunctions of the same year), with a few\r\nmiscellaneous books, was bought of the Rev. T. Lathbury, M.A., the\r\nwell-known writer on English Church history, for £300. Various rare\r\nEnglish books were purchased at Mr. Pickering's sale, and foreign\r\ndissertations, &c. at that of the library of Professor Godfrey Hermann,\r\nthe Greek editor and commentator (who died Dec. 31, 1848), at Leipsic,\r\nin April.\r\n\r\n[351] A portrait of Lord Derby, in his Chancellor's robes, painted by\r\nSir F. A. Grant, was given by him to the University about 1858, and now\r\nhangs in the Picture Gallery.\r\n\r\n[352] The Earl was High Steward of the University.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1855.\r\n\r\nThree Greek Biblical MSS. of great antiquity were obtained from the\r\ncollection of Prof. Tischendorf, being Nos. 3-5 of the volumes\r\ndescribed in a small quarto catalogue issued (anonymously) by him of\r\n_Codices Græci_, &c. One of these three is of the ninth century,\r\ncontaining the Gospel of St. Luke, with portions of the other Gospels,\r\nwhich was bought for £125; another of the eighth century, containing the\r\nwhole of St. Luke and St. John, bought for £140; the third, also of the\r\neighth century, containing the greatest part of Genesis, for £108.\r\n\r\n_Rev. T. R. Brown's Dictionary, &c. printed by himself._ See 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1856.\r\n\r\nA volume containing two autograph letters of Luther was bought for £20,\r\ntogether with a large collection of printed books (formed by --\r\nSchneider, of Berlin,) relating to him and the German Reformation, with\r\nvarious editions of his works, for £300. Another volume, with some small\r\nadditional papers in the Reformer's hand, was subsequently obtained.\r\n\r\nThe ever-increasing Bible collection received the addition of the very\r\nrare _ed. princ._ of the Bohemian Bible, printed at Prague in 1488,\r\nwhich was obtained for £17 10_s._, and a still more rare edition of the\r\nPentateuch, with New Test., &c. printed at Wittemberg in 1529, obtained\r\nfor eighteen guineas. A Roman Missal, printed 'ad longum, absque ulla\r\nrequisitione,' (_i.e._ in a kind of 'Prayer-book-as-read' form,) Lyons,\r\n1550, was obtained for £20. It was arranged by Nicholas Roillet, Chanter\r\nof the Church of S. Nicetius at Lyons, with the view of avoiding\r\ndifficulties and delays, 'sacerdotesque expectantibus molestos\r\nreddentes, ipsosque erga dictos circumstantes scandalum generantes, qui\r\nexistimant illos non solum ignaros sed nescientes quid agendum vel\r\nfaciendam habeant;' and was issued with the papal _imprimatur_ of Paul\r\nIII. But as Pius V and Clem. VIII subsequently forbade any variation\r\nwhatsoever from the authorized Roman form, this Missal, like the\r\nBreviary of Card. Quignones, was, with others, suppressed. And hence its\r\nrarity.\r\n\r\nFifty guineas were given for a very large collection of Chinese works,\r\nnumbering altogether about 1100, which had been gathered by Rev. F.\r\nEvans, for some time a missionary in China. Some of the Chinese books in\r\nthe Library have been subsequently examined and catalogued by Professor\r\nSummers, of King's College, London.\r\n\r\nOn May 22, a new body of Library Statutes was confirmed by Convocation,\r\nafter a complete revision of the previous regulations. The principal\r\nchanges, besides the omission of various obsolete requirements, were the\r\nadding five elected Curators, holding office for ten years, to the old\r\n_ex officio_ body of eight; the providing for the removal of books to\r\nthe extra-mural 'Camera,' or reading-room, about to be added; the fixing\r\nthe stipend of the Librarian (including all the former fees and small\r\nseparate payments) at £700, and that of the Sub-librarians at £300, and\r\nthe assigning to the former a retiring pension after twenty years'\r\nservice of £200, and after thirty years', of £300, and to the latter,\r\nafter thirty years', of £150; and the making a few alterations with\r\nregard to the times at which the Library should be closed, these times\r\nbeing lessened by about one week in the course of the year.\r\n\r\nA report from the eminent architect, Mr. G. G. Scott, on the means which\r\nmight be adopted for the enlargement of the Library, and for rendering\r\nit fire-proof, dated in Dec. 1855, was printed in this year, together\r\nwith one from Mr. Braidwood on the warming apparatus (see under 1821).\r\nMr. Scott's report contained suggestions for the extension of the\r\nLibrary throughout the whole of the quadrangle and adjoining buildings,\r\nincluding the Ashmolean Museum, and proposed that the Divinity School\r\nshould be assigned as a reading room, for which the great degree of\r\nlight afforded by its large windows appeared peculiarly to fit it. The\r\nsubsequent assignment, however, of the Radcliffe Library as a\r\nreading-room for the Library, removed the immediate necessity for any\r\nother extension. In 1858 a paper on the subject, illustrated with a plan\r\nof the Library, was printed by the late Dr. Wellesley, who, after\r\nconsidering the various modes then suggested for the enlargement of the\r\nLibrary, recommended the adoption (from the British Museum) of presses\r\nrunning up direct from the ground through all the floors, by which the\r\ndangers attendant upon the increase of weight of the wall-pressure would\r\nbe obviated.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1857.\r\n\r\nA collection of manuscripts, more interesting as to their history than\r\nas to their actual contents[353], was presented by William and Hubert\r\nHamilton, in memory, and in accordance with the wish, of their\r\ncelebrated father, Sir William Hamilton. It comprises fifty-eight\r\nvolumes (thirty-nine in folio, sixteen in quarto, and three in octavo)\r\nfrom the library of the Carthusian Monastery of Erfurt, famous as the\r\nplace of Luther's early abode. A short catalogue of them, by Joh. Broad,\r\nwas printed at Berlin in 1841, with a prefatory notice, from which we\r\nlearn that they were preserved at Erfurt until 1805, when the library\r\nwas broken up and dispersed on the occupation of the city by the French\r\narmy, who stabled their horses in the place where the books were\r\ndeposited, and burned many of them for fuel, while others were carried\r\naway and secreted with a view to their safety. Some of the latter were\r\nbought by the Count de Buelow, on whose death they were purchased from\r\nthe subsequent possessors by Broad, and finally sold by him to Sir W.\r\nHamilton. 'Nunc in eam terram demigrant,' says the bibliopolist, 'quæ,\r\nquodcunque alicujus pretii est aut materialium aut spiritualium rerum,\r\nin suo gremio accumulare a Providentia Divina destinata videtur.'\r\nAnother collection of MSS., from the same library at Erfurt, was on sale\r\nby Mr. J. M. Stark, the well-known bookseller (now of London), at Hull,\r\nin 1855, who issued a small catalogue of them in duodecimo.\r\n\r\nA valuable collection of Italian and Spanish MSS., amounting to about\r\nforty-six volumes, came to the Library by the bequest of Rev. Joseph\r\nMendham, M.A., of Sutton Coldfield, who died Nov. 1, 1856. The most\r\nimportant part of these is a series of twenty-eight volumes relating to\r\nthe Council of Trent, which were purchased at the sale of the Earl of\r\nGuildford's library in 1830 by Thorpe, the bookseller, for £35, and\r\nre-sold by him to Mr. Mendham in 1832 for fifty guineas. It was chiefly\r\nfrom the materials afforded by these that Mr. Mendham drew up his\r\n_Memoirs of the Council of Trent_, published in 1834. They are described\r\nin Thorpe's Catalogue of MSS. on sale in 1831, and in the preface to Mr.\r\nMendham's book.\r\n\r\nOn June 18, the Rev. Robert Payne Smith, M.A., of Pembroke College, was\r\nappointed an Assistant Sub-librarian for the Oriental department, in\r\nconsequence of the increasing infirmities of the aged senior\r\nSub-librarian, Mr. Reay.\r\n\r\n[353] For the most part, they consist of mediæval sermons and\r\ntheological treatises by writers of no great fame, together with some of\r\nthe works of Aquinas.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1858.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 30, an offer made by the Trustees of the Ashmolean Museum for\r\nthe transfer of the printed books, coins, and MSS. there contained to\r\nthe Bodleian, in order to facilitate the devotion of a part of the\r\nbuilding to the purposes of an Examination School, was accepted by the\r\nCurators; but a similar offer with regard to the antiquities was\r\ndeclined. The latter consequently remain in their old repository, but\r\nthe collections in Natural History were transferred to the New Museum.\r\nIt was not, however, until 1860, that the books were actually received\r\ninto the Library, where they now fill one small room. Altogether they\r\namount to upwards of 3700 volumes, forming five different series. First\r\nare those of Elias Ashmole himself, numbering originally 2175, but\r\nreduced by losses before the transfer to 2136, of which about 850 are\r\nMSS[354]. This collection is extremely rich in heraldic and genealogical\r\nmatter, together with an abundance of astrology. The printed books are\r\nchiefly scientific and historical; these, with the books in the\r\nfollowing collections, are now in process of incorporation into the new\r\nGeneral Catalogue of the Library. A list of the MSS. is given in\r\nBernard's catalogue, A.D. 1697; but a very elaborate and minute\r\naccount, forming a thick quarto volume, was drawn up by Mr. W. H. Black,\r\nthe well-known antiquary, and published in 1845. As this, however, was\r\ndestitute of an index, it remained comparatively useless until 1866,\r\nwhen a full Index, edited by the writer of this volume, was published\r\nunder the direction of the Delegates of the University Press.\r\n\r\nThe next collection is that of Anthony à Wood, containing about 130 MSS.\r\nand 970 printed volumes[355], which were bequeathed to the Museum by the\r\nowner on his death in Nov. 1695. The former are of extreme value for the\r\nhistory of Oxford and the neighbourhood; among the latter are most\r\ncurious sets of the pamphlets of the time, with the ballads, fly-sheets,\r\nchap-books, almanacks, &c. just such 'unconsidered trifles' as most men\r\nsuffer to perish in the using, but a few, like Wood, lay by for the\r\namusement and information of future generations. There are also seven\r\nvolumes of his own correspondence, including letters from Dugdale,\r\nEvelyn, &c. Of the MSS. a list is to be found in the old Catalogue of\r\n1697; a fuller and better one, compiled by William Huddesford, M.A.,\r\nthe Keeper of the Museum, was printed in a thin octavo volume, in 1761,\r\nwhich was reprinted by Sir Thomas Phillips, at Middlehill,\r\nWorcestershire, in 1824. There are also bundles of charters and deeds,\r\nchiefly monastic, but nearly all more or less mutilated or injured by\r\ndamp and dirt, so as to be partially useless.\r\n\r\nThe third collection is that of Dr. Martin Lister, physician to Queen\r\nAnne, who died Feb. 2, 1711/2. Besides his books, he was the donor of\r\nvarious other gifts to the Museum, in return for which he was created\r\nM.D. of Oxford, in 1683. The books are chiefly medical and scientific,\r\nand number in a written catalogue 1451 volumes (including thirty-two\r\nMSS.), but thirty-five of these were missing when the transfer from the\r\nMuseum was made.\r\n\r\nThe collections of Sir William Dugdale, which form a fourth series,\r\nnumber forty-eight volumes. A list of these is in the old Catalogue of\r\n1697.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth place there are the MSS. of the well-known antiquary, John\r\nAubrey. These are about twenty in number, of which fifteen are in his\r\nown hand, and are described in Britton's Life of him, printed for the\r\nWilts Topographical Society, pp. 88-123. Collections for the history of\r\nWiltshire, entitled _Hypomnemata Antiquaria_, form one of Aubrey's own\r\nworks[356], but unfortunately the second volume (marked with the letter\r\nB) is missing. It was borrowed from the Museum, in 1703, by William\r\nAubrey, the author's brother, and was never returned. A paper on the\r\nsubject was inserted by Rev. J. E. Jackson, in 1860, in vol. vii. of the\r\nWiltshire Archæological Magazine, and a reward for information as to the\r\npresent _locale_ of the missing volume was subsequently publicly\r\noffered, but to no purpose, by the same gentleman. A small MS. of\r\n_Horæ_, which had belonged to Sir Thomas Pope, the founder of Trinity\r\nCollege, is among Aubrey's books. A MS. of Matthew of Westminster, (now\r\n_e Mus._ 149) had been given to the Library by Aubrey, in 1675, through\r\nAnt. à Wood.\r\n\r\nThere are also five or six MSS. which were given to the Museum by\r\nWilliam Kingsley before 1700. Some few others, which were given by E.\r\nLhuyd and Dr. W. Borlase, together with a volume of W. Huddesford's\r\ncorrespondence, are now incorporated with the Ashmole MSS., and are\r\ndescribed in Mr. Black's catalogue, as well as the latest gift of this\r\nkind which was made to the Museum, _viz._ a little volume of _Private\r\nThoughts_, by Bishop Wilson, of Sodor and Man, which was presented in\r\n1824 by Lieut. Brett, R.N.\r\n\r\nThirty-nine choice Persian and Arabic MSS., which had formed part of Sir\r\nGore Ouseley's collection, were bought from his son, Sir Fred. Gore\r\nOuseley, Bart., the present Professor of Music, for £500. The rest of\r\nthe collection came by gift, as will be seen under the following year.\r\n\r\nAt the sale (in June-Aug.) of the library of Dr. Bliss, a large number\r\nof volumes (still kept separate) were purchased, including a volume of\r\noriginal letters of Charles I, Clarendon, &c., and poems by Lord Fairfax\r\n(see p. 97); together with many from the series of books of _Characters_\r\ncollected by Dr. Bliss, and from his like series, both of books printed\r\nin London shortly before the fire of 1666, and of books printed at\r\nOxford. The Library obtained by his bequest his own interleaved copy of\r\nthe _Athenæ_, with many MS. additions[357].\r\n\r\nA copy of the octavo Bible printed by Barker in 1631 (not 1632, as\r\ngenerally said), in which the word 'not' was omitted in the seventh\r\ncommandment, was bought for £40. For this error (which looks very much\r\nlike a wicked jest) the printer was fined 1000 marks by the High\r\nCommission Court[358], and the edition was rigidly suppressed, all the\r\ncopies which could be found being condemned to the flames.\r\n\r\nAnother purchase was a large collection of political tracts in seventy\r\nvolumes, chiefly relating to foreign affairs, which had been formed by\r\nMr. -- Hamilton, of the Diplomatic Service.\r\n\r\n[354] This number includes some fifteen or sixteen volumes given by\r\nsubsequent donors, but incorporated with Ashmole's own books.\r\n\r\n[355] About fifty volumes out of Wood's whole number were missing when\r\nthe Library became possessed of them.\r\n\r\n[356] These were printed by the Wiltshire Archæological Society in 1862,\r\nin one volume quarto, under the editorship of Rev. J. E. Jackson.\r\n\r\n[357] A very valuable Index of notes and references on all kinds of\r\nbiographical, historical, and antiquarian matters, contained in forty\r\nsmall covers, which had been the growth of the many years of Dr. Bliss's\r\nliterary researches, was bequeathed by him to Rev. H. O. Coxe, by whom\r\nit is kept in the Library for the use of readers. Several references are\r\nmade to this Index in the earlier part of the volume.\r\n\r\n[358] In Burn's _High Commission Court_, 1865, it is said (from the\r\nReports of proceedings in the Court) that the fine inflicted on Barker\r\nwas £200 and on Lucas £100. 'With some part of this fine Laud causeth a\r\nfair Greek character to be provided, for publishing such manuscripts as\r\ntime and industry should make ready for the publick view; of which sort\r\nwere the _Catena_ and _Theophylact_ set out by Lyndsell.' Heylin's\r\n_Cyprianus Anglicus_, p. 228.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1859.\r\n\r\nNumerous MSS., chiefly classical, patristic, or Italian, were purchased\r\nat the sale of M. Libri's collection in London, in March. Amongst them\r\nwas a Sacramentary, of the commencement of the ninth century, which was\r\nobtained for £43; and a copy of S. Cyprian's Epistles, also of the ninth\r\ncentury, for £84. Four volumes of the correspondence of Scholars at home\r\nand abroad with E. H. Barker, of Thetford, were also added to the\r\nLibrary from the sale of Mr. Dawson Turner's library. They are now\r\nnumbered Bodl. MSS. 1003-1006. And the munificent gift of a very\r\nvaluable collection of 422 volumes of Arabic and Persian MSS. was\r\nreceived from J. B. Elliott, Esq., of Calcutta. These chiefly consist of\r\nthe MSS. which Sir Gore Ouseley (who died Nov. 18, 1844,) obtained\r\nduring his diplomatic service in the East, commencing his collection\r\nwhen stationed at Lucknow, and completing it while ambassador in\r\nPersia; of which Mr. Elliott had been the purchaser. A small remaining\r\npart had previously been bought by the Library, as noted under 1858. In\r\n1860, Mr. Elliott added to his former gift a series of Eastern coins,\r\nand various handsome specimens of Eastern weapons; the latter are now\r\nexhibited in a case in the Picture Gallery. Five Sanscrit MSS. were\r\nreceived from Fitz-Edward Hall, Esq., of Saugur, who, at the same time,\r\nexpressed his munificent intention of presenting hereafter the whole of\r\nhis large collection.\r\n\r\nIn this year, after considerable enquiry had been made respecting\r\ndifferent modes of cataloguing, and Mr. Coxe had reported on the\r\narrangements adopted in the great libraries at home and some of those\r\nabroad, it was resolved by the Curators, upon that gentleman's\r\nrecommendation, that the plan in use in the British Museum should be\r\nimmediately introduced, for the purpose of commencing a new General\r\nCatalogue of all the printed books (excepting the Hebrew, of which a\r\nseparate catalogue had been made) in the whole Library. By this plan,\r\nthree or five copies, according as the case may be that of a single or\r\ndouble entry, are written simultaneously on prepared paper, as with a\r\nmanifold-copier, the transcribers writing out in this way the entries of\r\ntitles previously examined and corrected by the cataloguers. The\r\nseparate titles are then mounted, arranged in alphabetical order, and\r\nbound in volumes. By this plan two copies of the Catalogue are at once\r\nwritten with the labour of one, while surplus slips are also provided\r\nfor the formation hereafter of a classified catalogue as well. The use\r\nof the Catalogue, however, is thus confined to the Library itself; and\r\nthe literary world in general must still refer to the printed Catalogues\r\nof 1843 and 1851. A commencement of the new undertaking was made in this\r\nyear; but it was not until 1862 that the present staff (as to numbers)\r\nof assistants was employed, and the work completely organized. At\r\npresent the letters A-E, G-H are catalogued; and the extent to which the\r\nwhole Catalogue will run may be estimated from the fact that the letters\r\nB, C, and G fill sixty, sixty-five, and thirty-four volumes\r\nrespectively. All the books are seen and examined separately; anonymous\r\nauthors are, if possible, traced out; many errors in previous catalogues\r\nare corrected, and the number of entries is very largely increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1860.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of the Librarianship by Dr. Bandinel, after forty-seven\r\nyears of office in the capacity of Head, and a total of fifty of work in\r\nthe Library, forms a leading feature in the Bodley Annals of this year.\r\nAt the age of seventy-nine the natural infirmities of age were felt by\r\nhimself to be incapacitating him for the duties which he had so long and\r\nso regularly discharged, while at the same time the continually\r\nincreasing pressure of work and enlargement of the Library, made those\r\nduties much more onerous than they had been even a quarter of a century\r\nbefore. And so he resolved to withdraw at Michaelmas from the place to\r\nwhich he had been so heartily and entirely devoted, and which under his\r\nheadship had been doubled in contents. The parting was not without a\r\ngreat struggle; it was the abandoning what had been the cherished\r\noccupation of his life, and with the ceasing of that occupation he felt\r\na too-certain foreboding (which he expressed to the writer of these\r\npages) that the life would soon cease as well. A well-merited tribute\r\nwas paid to him by Convocation in June, in both increasing the amount of\r\nhis statutable pension, so that he retired on a full stipend, and in\r\nspecially enrolling him among the Curators of the Library. But he was\r\nseldom seen in the old place after his resignation; on two or three\r\noccasions only did he again mount the long flight of stairs which had of\r\nlate tried both his strength and breath severely; and then, when only\r\nseven months had elapsed, on Feb. 6, 1861, he passed away. And little\r\nmore than a fortnight previously, on January 20, his old colleague,\r\nProfessor Reay, departed this life, at the age of seventy-eight. He also\r\nhad retired on his pension at Michaelmas, 1860, and had been succeeded\r\nas Oriental Sub-librarian by Rev. R. Payne Smith (Assistant-librarian in\r\nthe same department since 1857), whose appointment was confirmed by\r\nConvocation on Nov. 22. Memoirs of Dr. Bandinel and Mr. Reay are given\r\nin the _Gentleman's Magazine_, (1861, pp. 463-6), which do justice, in\r\nthe case of the former, to his watchful solicitude for the Library and\r\nhis thorough acquaintance with it; and in the case of the latter\r\n(evidently from intimate personal acquaintance), to his great kindliness\r\nof heart, and simplicity and gentleness of character.\r\n\r\nThe Convocation for the election of Dr. Bandinel's successor was held on\r\nNovember 6, when, with unanimous consent, the Rev. H. O. Coxe, M.A.,\r\nSub-librarian since 1837, was appointed to the office.\r\n\r\nA most seasonable and valuable enlargement of the Library was effected,\r\nby an addition which henceforth marks an æra in our Annals. On June 12,\r\nConvocation thankfully accepted an offer from the Radcliffe Trustees\r\n(which had been first mooted by Dr. Acland in 1856), of the use, as a\r\nBodleian reading-room, of the noble building hitherto under their\r\ncontrol, the existing contents of which had (for the most part) been\r\nremoved to the New Museum. Dr. Radcliffe's own original intention had\r\nbeen the building an additional wing to the Bodleian rather than the\r\nerecting a library of his own; and subsequently the idea had been\r\nentertained of devoting his structure to the exclusive reception of\r\nmanuscripts[359]. Its appropriation, therefore, to the Bodleian upon\r\nthe removal of the library of medicine and natural history, was, in some\r\nsort, a return to the founder's first design. And the return came most\r\nseasonably, when the old walls of the Schools' quadrangle were well-nigh\r\nbursting from a plethora of books, and still the cry 'They come' daily\r\ncaused fresh bewilderment as to whither those that came should go. It\r\nwas resolved that the new reading-room thus opportunely gained should be\r\nappropriated to new books (arranged under a system of classification)\r\nand magazines; that it should be called the 'Camera Radcliviana;' and\r\nthat it should be open from ten A.M. to ten P.M., thus affording the\r\nfacilities for evening use of the Bodleian which had often been desired\r\nfor those who were occupied in college work during the day. It was at\r\nthe close of the year 1861 that the building began to be filled by its\r\nnew occupants, and on Jan. 27, 1862, (the necessary alterations and\r\npreparations having been completed in the short space of the Christmas\r\nvacation) it was announced by the Vice-Chancellor to be open as a\r\nReading Room in connection with the Bodleian. A grant of £200 _per\r\nannum_ towards the expense of management was made by Convocation on\r\nNov. 28, 1861, which was increased to £300 in 1865, the remainder of the\r\ncharge, consisting of the incidental expenses, being defrayed from the\r\ngeneral funds of the Library.\r\n\r\nA large additional space for the reception of books was gained by the\r\nclosing up the open ground-floor (through which was the former entrance\r\nto the reading-room), converting the spaces between the outer arches\r\ninto windows, and lining the walls within with book-shelves, thus\r\naffording accommodation, according to the present reckoning, for about\r\n50,000 volumes. The whole building may probably be reckoned as capable\r\nof containing altogether about 75,000 volumes[360].\r\n\r\nThe terms on which the Radcliffe Trustees made their offer, and which\r\nwere accepted by the University, were these:--1. That the Radcliffe\r\nBuilding should be a reading-room to the Bodleian, or be used for any\r\nother purpose of the Bodleian Library. 2. That it should remain the\r\nproperty of the Trustees, being esteemed a loan to the University. 3.\r\nThat no alteration should be made in the building without consent of the\r\nTrustees or a Representative approved by them. 4. That the expense of\r\nmaintaining the building should be borne by the Trustees.\r\n\r\nThe transfer of this magnificent room afforded a rare opportunity for\r\ndeveloping the usefulness of the Library to which it is now attached,\r\nand all who frequent it will acknowledge that that opportunity has been\r\nwell and worthily improved under the direction of the present Librarian.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 25, leave was granted by Convocation for the lending two Laud\r\nManuscripts, 561 and 563, being copies of the _Historia\r\nHierosoylmitana_, by Albert of Aix, to the French Government.\r\n\r\nAt the sale of the library of Dr. Wellesley, Principal of New Inn Hall,\r\na copy of Boccaccio's _Corbaccio_, 1569, was purchased, on account of\r\nits possessing the autograph of Sir Thomas Bodley, to whom it had been\r\ngiven by the editor, J. Corbinelli.\r\n\r\nA rare Salisbury _Primer_, printed at Rouen by Rob. Valentin in 1556,\r\nwas purchased for £22. Its title affords an amusing specimen of a\r\nforeigner's mode of printing English; it runs thus--_This prymer of\r\nSalisbury vse is se tout along with houtonyser chyng, with many prayers\r\n& goodly pyctures._ It is intended hereby to be conveyed to the English\r\nreader that, without any searching, he will find his prayers and psalms\r\nset out in their proper order.\r\n\r\n[359] In prosecution of this idea several valuable collections of\r\nOriental MSS. were obtained, which still form part of the stores of the\r\nold Radcliffe Library. They consist of the Arabic, Persian, and Sanscrit\r\nMSS. collected by -- Frazer and by Sale, the translator of the Koran,\r\nwhich were obtained (as we learn from Sharpe's _Prolegomena_ to Hyde's\r\n_Dissertationes_, 1767, vol. i. p. xvii.) through Professor Thomas Hunt,\r\nat the suggestion of Dr. Gregory Sharpe; and of the collations of the\r\nMSS. of the Hebrew Old Test. by Dr. Kennicott (Librarian 1767-1783),\r\ntogether with his correspondence and miscellaneous _codices_. The\r\nSanscrit MSS. of Frazer and Sale are described in Prof. Aufrecht's\r\ncatalogue. Other collections in the Radcliffe Library are the classical\r\nand historical (as well as medical) books of Dr. Frewin, a physician and\r\nCamden Professor of Anc. History; and the law books of Mr. Viner,\r\nfounder of the Vinerian Professorship and Scholarships; together with\r\nthe works of J. Gibbs, the justly famous architect of the building in\r\nwhich they were kept, and some coins bequeathed by Wise, the first\r\nLibrarian. Two volumes of Clarendon MSS. were bought for the Library in\r\n1780, but were united some years since to the mass of those papers\r\npreserved in the Bodleian. It was not until the year 1811 that the\r\nLibrary was specially assigned to Medicine and Natural History. (See\r\n_Report on the transfer of the Radcliffe Library to the Univ. Museum_,\r\nby Dr. Acland, 1861.)\r\n\r\n[360] An account of this assignment and arrangement of the Radcliffe\r\nLibrary, as also of the transfer of the Ashmolean books to the Bodleian,\r\nappeared in the _Athenæum_ for Jan. 1865, p. 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1861.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and four volumes of Tamil MSS. were purchased; as well as\r\nfour Samaritan MSS. of the Pentateuch, of the twelfth century, which had\r\nbeen brought to England by a native of Samaria.\r\n\r\nThe Syriac MSS. of the well-known Orientalist, Dr. Bernstein, were\r\npurchased by the Delegates of the Press, with a view to assisting in the\r\ngreat work of a Syriac Lexicon, upon which Mr. (now Dr.) Payne Smith was\r\n(and still is) engaged.\r\n\r\nThe printing of the Annual Catalogues of purchases was discontinued,\r\nafter the issue of the Catalogue for this year. Written registers are\r\nnow kept in the Library of all the books bought in the course of each\r\nyear; and only a list of benefactors, with the statement of accounts, is\r\nannually printed for circulation in the University and amongst donors.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1862.\r\n\r\nA large collection of British Essayists and Periodicals was presented by\r\nthe late Rev. F. W. Hope, D.C.L., the munificent benefactor to the\r\nUniversity Museum, the founder of the Professorship of Zoology, and the\r\ndonor also of a large collection of engraved portraits and other\r\nprints[361]. The collection was one which had been formed by John Thomas\r\nHope, Esq., the donor's father. It contains some 760 specimens of its\r\nclass of literature, belonging chiefly to the eighteenth century.\r\nSpecial thanks for the gift were returned by Convocation, on Feb. 20. A\r\ncatalogue, which had been drawn up for Mr. Hope by Mr. Jacob Henry Burn,\r\ncontaining notices in detail of the various publications, was printed at\r\nthe University Press, in 1865, in an octavo volume.\r\n\r\nA Hebrew MS. of the Pentateuch, probably of the thirteenth century, was\r\nbought for £32 10_s._ Some tracts relating to the period of the Great\r\nRebellion were bought at the sale of Dr. Bandinel's extensive Caroline\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nOn March 4, the Curators accepted the gift of a bust of Rev. F. W.\r\nRobertson, late incumbent of Trinity Chapel, Brighton, which had been\r\npurchased by subscription. It is now placed in the Picture Gallery.\r\n\r\nA large number of purchase-duplicates, which had accumulated during the\r\ncourse of many years, were removed from the Library and sold by auction,\r\nin London, by Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson, in May. Among them were\r\nsome of great rarity. The sale, which lasted five days, produced £766\r\n2_s._ 6_d._; of which £110 5_s._ were given for a specimen of the St.\r\nAlban's press, the _Rhetorica Nova_ of Gul. de Saona, printed in 1489.\r\nA second and smaller sale, containing many English works of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, took place on April 12, 1865, at\r\nwhich a copy of Chettle's _Kind-Harts Dreame_ (1593), produced £101, and\r\nDecker's _Guls Horne-Booke_, 1609, £81. The proceeds of the whole sale\r\namounted to £750 18_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Alfred Hackman, M.A., Chaplain and Precentor of Ch. Ch., and P.\r\nC. of St. Paul's, Oxford, and an Assistant in the Library of twenty-five\r\nyears' standing, was approved by Convocation, on April 12, as Mr. Coxe's\r\nsuccessor in the Sub-librarianship; after a discussion, which led to the\r\nabrogation by Convocation, in February, of a provision in the Statutes\r\nforbidding the holding cure of souls in connection with that office or\r\nthat of Head-librarian without special licence from the Curators.\r\n\r\n[361] These engravings are deposited in the gallery of the Radcliffe,\r\nunder the charge of a separate Keeper, the Rev. J. Treacher, M.A. They\r\ndo not belong to the Bodleian.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1863.\r\n\r\nAmong the purchases made in this year were the following: Card. Ximenes'\r\nrare treatise entitled _Crestia_, printed at Valentia in 1483 (£25);\r\nCourt-Rolls of Tamworth, Solihull, and other neighbouring places,\r\nobtained from Mr. Halliwell; and a collection, in three thick folio\r\nvolumes, of placards, hand-bills, &c., relating to the town of Coventry,\r\nformed by Mr. W. Reader, a printer in that place.\r\n\r\nCapt. Montagu Montagu, R.N., who died at Bath, on July 3 in this year,\r\nbequeathed a collection of about 700 volumes, in various branches of\r\nliterature, which was received at the Library about the beginning of\r\n1864. There are about ninety editions and versions of the Psalter, with\r\nworks on Psalmody, including a metrical version by Capt. Montagu\r\nhimself; a large number of editions of Anacreon, Horace, Juvenal,\r\nPhædrus, Petrarch, Boileau, and Fontaine's _Fables_; a few MSS. of\r\nJuvenal, Petrarch, &c. with a large series of autograph letters,\r\nchiefly obtained at Upcott's sale. There are, besides, a number of\r\ntopographical and biographical works illustrated, _more Sutherlandico_,\r\nwith additional engravings, together with many parcels of separate\r\nprints arranged for the same purpose. One item of particular interest\r\nwhich accompanied the collection is a small sketch of Napoleon I, in\r\nprofile, admirably executed by the well-known Italian artist, Giuseppe\r\nLonghi. It now hangs, framed and glazed, in the Library, together with a\r\nletter from Longhi himself, in French, dated at Milan, June 4, 1828, in\r\nwhich he narrates the occasion on which it was taken. He attended, in\r\n1801, at Lyons, as a member of the 'Consulte Cisàlpine,' for the\r\nsettling the affairs of the Republic of Italy, under the presidency of\r\nthe First Consul. It happened that during the delivery of a long\r\nharangue, full of tedious flattery, Napoleon sat _vis-à-vis_ with the\r\norator; and Longhi saw that an opportunity for exercising the cunning of\r\nhis pencil had come. The light, which streamed in through the great\r\nwindow of the Church (!) where they were assembled, brought out the\r\nprofile very clearly; there was little fear of being cut short by the\r\nspeaker's suddenly ceasing his declamation, or of being interrupted by\r\nmovement on the part of the unconscious subject of the operation, for\r\nthe latter sat immersed in thought upon matters far away, while\r\nregarding the speaker with a pensive air; and so, while Napoleon sat\r\npondering, Longhi sat sketching. And everybody, he declares with a\r\npardonable pride, at Lyons and Paris, pronounced the likeness to be\r\nexcellent. A small bust of Napoleon, now placed in the great window,\r\ncame to the Library at the same time. A catalogue of Capt. Montagu's\r\nbooks, comprising forty octavo pages, was printed and circulated with\r\nthe Annual Statement for 1864.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1864.\r\n\r\nThe chief acquisitions in manuscript books were various Hebrew volumes\r\n(for £159), and a series of letters to Malone from Dr. Johnson, Mrs.\r\nSiddons, and others; and in printed books, a perfect copy of Cromwell's\r\nGreat Bible, printed by Grafton in 1539, which was bought of Mr. Fry,\r\nthe well-known collector, for £100.\r\n\r\nA sixth part of the general catalogue of MSS. was issued, containing the\r\nSyriac, Carshunic and Mendean MSS., in number 205, which had been drawn\r\nup by Rev. R. Payne Smith, M.A., and to which several facsimiles were\r\nappended. And the eighth part, containing the Sanscrit MSS., in number\r\n854, appeared under the editorship of Theodore Aufrecht, M.A., now\r\nProfessor of Sanscrit in the University of Edinburgh. A first\r\n_fasciculus_ of this had been issued in 1859.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1865.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of January, a sale was held in London by Messrs.\r\nSotheby and Wilkinson, of the stock of the late Mr. William Henry\r\nElkins, a bookseller, of 41, Lombard Street. At this sale, the Library\r\nwas the fortunate purchaser of what appears to be a genuine _Shakespeare\r\nAutograph_. The book is Ovid's _Metamorphoses_, printed by Aldus, at\r\nVenice, in October, 1502, in octavo; and on the title is the signature\r\n'W^m. Sh^r.' in a hand bearing no resemblance whatever to that of\r\nthe Ireland forgeries, but not unlike that of the signature attached to\r\nShakespeare's will. Opposite to the title, on a leaf pasted down on the\r\noriginal binding of the book, is the note, most certainly a genuine\r\nmemorandum of the date to which it professedly belongs, of which a\r\nfaithful facsimile is given with that of the autograph itself, in the\r\naccompanying lithograph[362]. That the note itself is no forgery is\r\nadmitted by all who have examined it; the volume, therefore, is\r\ncertainly, by tradition, one which belonged to the poet. The only\r\nquestion is, whether the name may not have been forged in consequence of\r\nthe existence of this note. To this, which is the opinion of some, it\r\nmay fairly be replied, that, seeing no contracted form of Shakespeare's\r\nsignature is known to exist, a forger would hardly have invented one for\r\nthe occasion, but would have given the name in full; while, on the other\r\nhand, if the signature be real, what more natural than that a subsequent\r\nowner should record the tradition that the indefinite 'Sh^r.' of this\r\nunimportant title-page was no other than the very definite 'Shakspere'\r\nhimself? The names mentioned in the note are names, as every one knows,\r\nconnected with the poet's history. _Hall_ was the marriage name of his\r\ndaughter Susannah, to whom he left his house in Henley Street; and one\r\nWilliam Hall, a glover, appears from the Stratford Records printed by\r\nMr. Halliwell, to have had a house in that street in 1660. He,\r\ndoubtless, was the donor of the volume. Susannah Hall's daughter,\r\nElizabeth, was married to a Thomas Nash, who died in 1647; but though he\r\ndied without issue, the initials 'T. N.' may well stand for some member\r\nof the family who bore the same names. That, therefore, a Hall should\r\npossess the book, and subsequently give it to (most probably) a Nash,\r\ngoes far to establish its genuineness as a Shakespeare relic. In a full\r\naccount of the volume, supporting its pretensions, which appeared in the\r\n_Athenæum_ for Jan. 28, 1865 (p. 126), it was pointed out that the two\r\nreferences to the story of Baucis and Philemon, which are found in\r\nShakespeare's Plays, show that he was not unacquainted with the\r\n_Metamorphoses_. To this may be added a better proof of his knowledge of\r\nOvid's writings in the fact that two lines from the _Amores_ (I. xv.\r\n35, 36) form the motto to the _Venus and Adonis_. As the volume is\r\nsomewhat dirty, and has a well-worn air, it may possibly have been used\r\nby Shakespeare during those school-keeping experiences of which Aubrey\r\ntells us; possibly, however, the wear and tear may be due to an older\r\nowner, who has plentifully interspersed his MS. notes in, apparently, a\r\nforeign hand, on many of the pages. Owing to a generally-entertained\r\nsuspicion throughout the auction-room on the occasion of the sale of the\r\nvolume, that the autograph must be a forgery, the Library became its\r\npossessor for the small sum of £9[363]!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OVIDII METAMORPHOSEΩN\r\n  LIBRI QVINDECIM.\r\n\r\n  W^m Sh^r.\r\n\r\n  ALDVS\r\n\r\n  This little Book of Ovid was given to me\r\n  by W Hall who sayd it was once Will\r\n  Shakspares\r\n\r\n  T N\r\n\r\n  1682\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nA small volume, containing several papers in the handwriting of Luther,\r\nwas bought for £45. The first edition of Coverdale's New Testament,\r\nprinted at Antwerp, by Matthew Crom, in 1538, was added to the Biblical\r\ncollection. Two interesting and important series of newspapers were\r\nobtained; the one, a set (not quite perfect) of the _London Gazette_,\r\nfrom 1669 to 1859, bought for £200[364]; and the other, a collection of\r\nLondon newspapers, from 1672 to 1737, arranged in chronological order in\r\nninety-six volumes, obtained also for £200. This very curious collection\r\nhad been formed by Mr. John Nichols; its escape from destruction by the\r\ndisastrous fire at his printing-office in 1808, is mentioned at p. 99 of\r\nthe _Gentleman's Magazine_ for that year. It is accompanied by a MS.\r\nindex, drawn up by Mr. Nichols himself. Many unknown contributions by\r\nDefoe to the journals of his time, have recently been traced in this\r\nseries by a gentleman who has made a special study of the Defoe\r\nliterature, Mr. W. Lee.\r\n\r\nConsiderable assistance in completing the Library sets of the Public and\r\nPrivate Acts of Parliament was afforded, in this year, by the late Mr.\r\nW. Salt.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the first books printed in the Dyak language, which were\r\nissued at Singapore in 1862, were given by Rev. J. Rigaud, B.D., of\r\nMagdalene College.\r\n\r\nOn the appointment of Dr. Jacobson to the See of Chester, Mr. R. Payne\r\nSmith became his successor in the office of Regius Professor of\r\nDivinity. Professor Max Müller, M.A., was thereupon nominated to take\r\nMr. Smith's place as the Sub-librarian in special charge of the Oriental\r\ndepartment, and the nomination was confirmed in Convocation on Nov. 7.\r\n\r\n[362] The lithograph represents the lower half of the title-page.\r\n\r\n[363] The purchase of it, as of a relic 'which there is little doubt is\r\ngenuine,' is noticed in an article on Books and Book-collecting in the\r\n_Cornhill Magazine_ for Oct. 1867, p. 496.\r\n\r\n[364] The only portions of the _London Gazette_ previously to be found\r\nin the Library, were of the reign of Charles II; and these only came by\r\nthe transfer of the Ashmolean Library.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1866.\r\n\r\nThere is not much to notice under this year, save that the _Vulgaria\r\nquedam abs Terencio in Anglicam linguam traducta_, printed at Oxford\r\nbefore 1483, was obtained, in a volume containing also two tracts\r\nprinted by J. de Westphalia, at the sale of the library of Mr. Thomas\r\nThomson, of Edinburgh, for £36. Although complete in itself, it appears\r\nto have formed a part of a larger work, as the signatures run from n. to\r\nq., in eights.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D. 1867.\r\n\r\nThe closing year of these memorials is distinguished by the acquisition\r\nof a volume described by Archdeacon Cotton, in his _Typographical\r\nGazetteer_, as being 'of the very highest rarity.' It is a fine copy of\r\nthe _Breviarium Illerdense_, printed at Lerida, in Spain, in 1479, by\r\nHenry Botel. Besides being remarkable from its rarity, there is special\r\ninterest attaching to the volume from the fact that it was printed at\r\nthe sole expense of the bell-ringer of the cathedral! The colophon\r\nstates that 'Antonius Palares, campanarum ejusdem ecclesiæ pulsator,\r\npropriis expensis fieri fecit.' The volume was bought from Mr. Boone\r\nfor £36.\r\n\r\nA somewhat imperfect copy of the rare Bible printed at Edinburgh by\r\nArbuthnot and Bassandyne in 1579, being the first edition printed in\r\nScotland, was another purchase of the year; as were also two thick\r\nvolumes of recent transcripts of the Stuart correspondence, preserved in\r\nthe Imperial Library at Paris.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few years considerable attention has been paid by the\r\nLibrarian to the formation of a series of editions of the English Bible.\r\nThe number now collected is very large, and approaches very nearly to a\r\ncomplete gathering of every edition before 1800, which has any claim to\r\nregard either from date, imprint, variety of size, correctness, or\r\nincorrectness. Early Quaker tracts have also been largely collected,\r\ntogether with editions of Cotton Mather's works and those of John\r\nBunyan.\r\n\r\nA portrait of the Prince of Wales, in academic dress, painted by Sir J.\r\nWatson Gordon, was presented towards the close of the year to the\r\nUniversity by the Prince, in memory of his academic days, and now hangs\r\nconspicuously at the entrance of the Picture Gallery, to which it forms\r\nthe latest addition.\r\n\r\nProf. Max Müller having resigned his Sub-librarianship on account of\r\nhealth, the Rev. J. W. Nutt, M.A., Fellow of All Souls' College, was\r\napproved by Convocation, on June 25, as his successor in the charge of\r\nthe Oriental department.\r\n\r\nThe number of printed _volumes_ at present in the Library may be\r\nestimated at nearly 350,000. It was returned to Parliament, in 1848, as\r\nabout 220,000; and with a view to this return a calculation as nearly\r\naccurate as possible was then made. An estimate has now been made of the\r\nadditions received since that date; and from this it appears that some\r\n79,500 volumes have been placed in the old Library and 45,000 in the\r\n_Camera Radcliviana_, making a total for the whole collection of about\r\n345,000 volumes. Within the same period about 5000 additional\r\nmanuscripts have been obtained, making a total of nearly 25,000. The\r\nnumber was returned in 1848 as being about 21,000, but this appears to\r\nhave been somewhat in excess of the fact. The proportion was singularly\r\noverestimated in 1819, for Clarke, in his _Repertorium Bibliographicum_\r\npublished in that year (p. 68), states that the Library contains upwards\r\nof 160,000 volumes, of which 30,000 are manuscripts! The annual rate of\r\nordinary increase of printed books at present, apart, of course, from\r\nthe accession of any entire collection or special purchase, may be\r\nreckoned at about 3000 volumes, exclusive of magazines, of which\r\ntwo-thirds come from Stationers' Hall under the provisions of the\r\nCopyright Act.\r\n\r\nFloreat Bibliotheca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Account of the Muscovite Cloak mentioned at p. 40. Extracted from vol.\r\nvi. of B. Twyne's Collections (among the University Archives), f. 97._\r\n\r\n'_Mr. Smyth's Relation of the Tartar Lambskinne garment in Bodleiana,\r\nOxon._\r\n\r\n'Sir Rich. Lee, knight, about the later ende of the raigne of the late\r\nQu. Elizabeth, being by her Maiestie sent ambassador into Russia,\r\namongest other novelties of the cuntry found by the information of the\r\ninhabitants, that in Tartaria, a cuntrie neere adioyning to Muscovia and\r\nRussia, and vnder the gouernement of the Emperour of Russia, there did\r\nsome yeres growe out of the ground certaine livinge creatures in the\r\nshape of lambes, bearinge wooll vppon them, very like to the lambes of\r\nEngland, in this manner; viz., a stalke like the stalke of an\r\nhartichocke did growe vp out of the ground, and vppon the toppe thereof\r\na budd, which by degrees did growe into the shape of a lambe, and became\r\na liuinge creature, resting vppon the stalke by the navell; and as soone\r\nas it did come to life, it would eate of the grasse growinge round about\r\nit, and when it had eaten vp the grasse within its reach it would die.\r\nAnd then the people of the cuntry as they finde these lambes doe flea of\r\ntheir skins, which they preserue and keepe, esteeminge them to bee of\r\nexcellent vse and vertue, especially against the plague and other\r\nnoysome diseases of those cuntries.\r\n\r\n'Vppon this information, Sir Rich. Lee was very desirous to haue some of\r\nthe skyns of these Tartar lambes for his money, which at that time was\r\nnot to be gotten for money; for that whensoeuer any of those lambes were\r\nat any time found, it was very rarely; and then also when they were\r\nfound, they were presented to the Emperor, or to some other great man of\r\nthe cuntrie, as a present of great worthe.\r\n\r\n'At this time the Emperour had a gowne or longe cloake, made after the\r\nfashion of that cuntrie with the skins of those Tartar lambes; which\r\ngarment the then Duke, and since Kinge, of Swethland was very desirous\r\nto haue and offered great summes of money for, but could by no meanes\r\nobtayne his desire.\r\n\r\n'At this time also Sir Rich. Lee had an agatt of so great biggenesse\r\nthat he made thereof a pestle and a morter, whiche the Emperour hauinge\r\nnotice of, was desirous to haue for his money. Sir Rich. Lee,\r\nvnderstandinge thereof, sent it to the Emperour as a present from him,\r\nwhich the Emperour would not accept as a gift, neither would he haue it\r\nbut for his money. Sir Richard, beinge willinge the Emperour should haue\r\nthe pestle and the morter, yet lothe to playe the marchant at that time,\r\ndid therefore deliuer this pestle and morter, into the hands and\r\ncustodie of the Emperour's physitian to beate his physicke in it for the\r\nEmperour; which manner of giuinge this pestle and morter did so please\r\nthe Emperour, as that he caused secret enquirie to be made whether there\r\nwere any thinge in those cuntries which Sir Richard was desirous to\r\nhaue, and by that means had notice that Sir Richard had endeuoured to\r\nhaue gotten some of their lambeskyns. Wherevppon the Emperour, after Sir\r\nRichard had taken his leaue of him, and had receaued a great gift of him\r\nas an Ambassador, and was departed one dayes iourney toward England, the\r\nEmperour sent after him the before mentioned garment so made with their\r\nTartar lambeskyns as aforesaide, and with it some fewe skynnes loose,\r\nand gaue them all vnto him freelie.\r\n\r\n'Sir Richard Lee, travaylinge homewards, came to the Kinge of\r\nSwethlandes court, who demaunded of him of diverse thinges of the\r\ncuntrie of Muscovia; and, amongest other thinges, asked him whether he\r\nhad seene the aforesaid garment, and he answered, that he had not only\r\nseene it, but had it in his possession; whereat the Kinge of Swethland\r\nadmired, sayinge he had longe laboured to get it for loue or money, but\r\ncould neuer obtayne it.\r\n\r\n'Sir Rich. Lee in this iourney had not onely gotten this garment and\r\nTartar lambeskyns, but diverse other rich furres and other rarities of\r\ngreat price; the greatest part whereof the Queene tooke of him, and\r\npromised him recompence for them, which she neuer performed; which was\r\npartly the cause that he concealed this garment from her duringe her\r\nlife. And when Sir Rich. Lee died himselfe, he by his will gaue it to\r\nthe Library in Oxford, to be kept as a monument there, beinge, as he\r\nconceiued, the fittest place for a jewell of so great worth and\r\næstimation as that is or ought to be.\r\n\r\n'Sir Rich. Lee was the neere kinseman of my wife; by reason whereof, I\r\nwas very familiarly acquaynted with him; and vppon conference had with\r\nhim about his trauayles at sundry times, I had the true relation of all\r\nthe premisses from his owne mouthe. And I comminge to Oxford to the Act,\r\nand findinge this garment in Sir Tho. Bodley's studdie or closet,\r\nwithout any expression made of the raritie or worth of this garment,\r\ndid discouer so much as I haue herein written to Mr. Russe, the Keeper\r\nof the Library; at whose request I haue sett it downe, in writinge. And\r\nin testimonie of the truthe thereof, I haue herevnto subscribed my name,\r\nthe 13th of July, 1624.\r\n\r\n                                          'EDWARD SMYTHE.\r\n\r\n  'Transcribed out of the originall with Mr. Russe.\r\n  'This Mr. Smyth was a Counsellor of the Temple.'\r\n\r\nIt appears from this account that the box of scented wood ordered by the\r\nCurators in 1614 had never been provided, and that the cloak was already\r\nbeginning to be neglected. Doubtless suspicion had been early excited as\r\nto the truth of the traveller's story which had accompanied the gift,\r\nand which could scarcely have obtained real credence later than the days\r\nof Marco Polo or Sir John Mandeville. In the Ashmolean Museum a painting\r\nis preserved which represents the _Agnus Scythicus_ in its fabled state;\r\na full-grown lamb poised on the top of a vegetable stalk, with its legs\r\ndependent in the air[365]. But the key to the mystery is attached in the\r\nlabel on the frame: '_Polypodium Barometz_. Linn.' It is, in truth, only\r\na large fern found in Tartary, of which the rhizoma is covered with the\r\nwoolly fungus-like growth, found in greater or less degree on many\r\nspecies of ferns. If the plant be dug up and inverted, the roots being\r\nuppermost and the fronds pendent, a strong imagination might find some\r\nresemblance in the former to a wool-clad body, and in the latter to\r\nlimbs, while some of the young fronds with their spiral convolutions\r\nmight be compared to the horns of a ram, such as are duly represented in\r\nthe painting mentioned above. A specimen of the plant may be seen in the\r\ngreenhouses of the Botanic Garden, Oxford, where it is still known by\r\nthe name which the fable imposed, _Agnus Scythicus_. So great is the\r\nwoolly growth found upon one species of tree-fern in New Zealand, that\r\n(as the writer was informed by Mr. Baxter, the Keeper of the Botanic\r\nGarden) tons of it are yearly imported into this country for the purpose\r\nof stuffing cushions. A finer and silkier substance is found on a fern\r\nindigenous in Mexico.\r\n\r\n[365] For acquaintance with this picture the author is indebted to Mr.\r\nRowell, whose scientific knowledge so well fits him for the post he\r\nworthily holds as Under-keeper of the Ashmolean Museum. In Tradescant's\r\nCatalogue of the first contents of this Museum as formed by himself,\r\npublished in 1656, occurs 'a coat lyned with _Agnus Scythicus_,' but it\r\ndoes not now exist in the collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Books printed on Vellum, which have been added to the Library\r\nsince the year 1830[366]._\r\n\r\n1460. _Clementis VIII Constitutiones, cum glossa Jo.

Rawlinson, B. 455.\r\n\r\n[Many of Laud's MSS. came from a Carthusian Monastery near Mentz, and\r\nfrom the Monastery of Eberbach, in the Duchy of Baden. It is worth\r\nmentioning that No. 233 amongst his Miscellaneous MSS. belonged to John\r\nLydgate, and No. 576 to John Foxe. Several others had been previously in\r\nthe possession of Archbp. Usher, and of Lindsell, Bishop of\r\nPeterborough.\r\n\r\nNo. 76 of Digby's MSS. was bought by Dr. John Dee, at London, May 18,\r\n1556, 'ex bibliotheca Joh. Lelandi.']\r\n\r\n[367] This list does not profess to be complete. But it is believed to\r\ncomprehend most of the MSS. which afford distinct evidence of former\r\nownership of this kind.\r\n\r\n[368] _Picus Mirandula de Providentia Dei_, 1508. Given to the library\r\nof the Church by Rich. Sparchiford, Archdeacon of Salop, Oct. 19, 1557.\r\nIt had previously belonged to Linacer.\r\n\r\n[369] 'Hunc librum emit ... a magistro Philips, rectore collegii Exon,\r\na^o. Xi. 1468, una cum volvella solis et lunæ.'\r\n\r\n[370] _Galani Conciliatio Eccl. Armenæ cum Romana_, 1650. It is\r\nsatisfactory to be able to add, that the Bodleian obtained this book, as\r\nBishop Booth obtained the Robertsbridge MS. (_infra_) 'modo legitimo;' a\r\nmemorandum records that it was 'bought of Fletcher the bookseller.'\r\n\r\n[371] On the last leaf of this MS. there is a list, faintly written with\r\na style, of some twenty MSS. (including 'triplices cantus' for the\r\norgan), written by one monk, to which the memorandum is added: 'Hec sunt\r\nopera fratris W. de Wi[=c]b. per quadriennium apud Leom. (_i.e._\r\nLeominster, a cell to Reading) commorantis.' The list commences, 'Nota\r\nquod frater W. de Wi[=c]b. (_probably Wicumbe_), precibus domini J. de\r\nAbbend. tunc precentoris, hortatu vero et precepto domino R. de Wygorn.\r\ntunc supprioris, collectarium cotidianum secundum usum Rading correxit\r\net de duobus unum fecit.' The book may have belonged to either Reading\r\nor Leominster.\r\n\r\n[372] The usual anathema is subjoined on any one stealing the book from\r\nthe house of St. Mary 'de Ponte Roberti,' or in any part mutilating it;\r\nwhich is followed by this self-exculpatory note on the part of a\r\nsubsequent possessor: 'Ego Johannes, Exon. episcopus, nescio ubi est\r\ndomus prædicta, nec hunc librum abstuli, sed modo legittimo adquisivi.'\r\nThis _John_ would seem to be John Booth, who was Bishop of Exeter from\r\n1466 to 1479.\r\n\r\n[373] The name of Peter Fader is found also in MS. Arch. Seld. B 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of MSS. and Miscellaneous Objects of interest exhibited in the\r\nLibrary._\r\n\r\n\r\nGLASS CASE NEAR THE ENTRANCE OF THE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n1. A Telugu MS. on palm-leaves, brought from India by Sir Thos. Strange,\r\nformerly Chief Justice of Madras, together with a style employed for\r\nwritings of this kind, and a pocket-knife. Given by Sir T. Strange's\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Edmund Foulkes, in 1864.\r\n\r\n2. Drawings and engravings of Buddhist idols; brought from a Joss-house\r\nin a Llama monastery in Pekin, in 1862, and given to the Library by\r\nLieut.-Col. Gibbes Rigaud, of the 60th Rifles.\r\n\r\n3. Autograph book of distinguished visitors.\r\n\r\n    This book commences at the year 1820. Among the autographs which\r\n    it contains may be mentioned the following in particular:--\r\n\r\n    Her Majesty the Queen, Nov. 8, 1832, with the Duchess of Kent;\r\n    Dec. 12, 1860.\r\n\r\n    The Prince Consort, June 15, 1841; June 4, 1856; Jan. 9, 1857 (in\r\n    company with his three eldest children); Dec. 12, 1860.\r\n\r\n    Prince of Wales, Jan. 9, 1857; March 27, 1860; June 18, 1863.\r\n\r\n    Princess of Wales, June 18, 1863.\r\n\r\n    Duke of Wellington, Oct. 20, 1835 (in company with Q. Adelaide);\r\n    Sept. 14, 1839; June 15, 1841; Aug. 20, 1844.\r\n\r\n    Gul. Gesenius, Aug. 5, 1820.\r\n\r\n    Sir John Franklin, 1829.\r\n\r\n    Sir D. Wilkie, June 14, 1834.\r\n\r\n    Bishop Selwyn, June 30, 1837.\r\n\r\n    Chevalier Bunsen, Jan. 24, 1839; Aug. 20, 1844.\r\n\r\n    Princes of Ashantee, June 10, 1840.\r\n\r\n    Henry Hallam, Oct. 16, 1840.\r\n\r\n    Bishop of Malabar, Mar Athanasius Abdelmesih, June 12, 1841.\r\n\r\n    M. Berryer, Nov. 23, 1843.\r\n\r\n    W. H. Prescott, June 24, 1850.\r\n\r\n    Alfred Tennyson, June 21, 1855.\r\n\r\n    A Siamese Prince, June 29, 1858.\r\n\r\n    Lord Brougham, June 20, 1860.\r\n\r\n    Lord Palmerston, July 2, 1862.\r\n\r\n    Queen Emma of Honolulu, Aug. 14, 1865.\r\n\r\n    Chinese Ambassadors, June 7, 1866.\r\n\r\n    Until the year 1861 it was also the custom for all graduates of\r\n    Cambridge and Dublin who were admitted ad _eundem_ to enter their\r\n    names in this book; it is to this custom that we owe possession of\r\n    the signature of the ex-Metropolitan of New Zealand[374].\r\n\r\n4. _New Testament_, said to be bound in a piece of a waistcoat of King\r\nCharles I. See p. 53.\r\n\r\n5. Another, bound by the Sisters of Little Gidding. See p. 53.\r\n\r\n6. _Xiphilini Epitome Dionis Nicæi_; Gr. 4to. Par. printed by Rob.\r\nStephens, 1551. Bound in a handsomely tooled and gilt calf binding, in\r\nthe Grolier style, with the badge of Dudley, Earl of Leicester, viz. the\r\nBear and Ragged Staff, in the centre. Bequeathed by Selden.\r\n\r\n7. _Bacon's Essays_; in a worked binding. See p. 51.\r\n\r\n8. Specimen of the early _Block-books_, or books printed from engraved\r\nblocks before the invention of moveable types; being the Apocalypse,\r\nrepresented in a series of rudely-engraved scenes, with short\r\nexplanatory descriptions.\r\n\r\n    This is a copy of the edition called by Mr. S. Leigh Sotheby, in his\r\n    _Principia Typographica_, the Second; it belonged to Mr. Douce, who\r\n    bought it for thirty-one guineas at Mr. Inglis' sale[375].\r\n\r\n9. The first book printed from moveable types; being a very fine copy,\r\nof the grand Latin Bible, printed by Gutenberg at Mentz about 1455. See\r\np. 202.\r\n\r\n    A copy was sold at the auction of the library of the Duke of Sussex,\r\n    in 1844, for the moderate sum of £190; when the same copy, however,\r\n    was re-sold at the auction of the library of Dr. Daly, Bishop of\r\n    Cashel, in 1858, it produced no less than £596.\r\n\r\n10. A copy of the first book printed in the English language, being _The\r\nRecuyell of the Histories of Troy_, printed by Caxton, most probably at\r\nBruges, about 1472.\r\n\r\n    This copy wants three leaves; it was given to the Library in 1750,\r\n    by James Bowen, a painter of Shrewsbury, well known as a local\r\n    antiquarian. A second copy, which wants seven leaves, is also in the\r\n    Library. A copy, wanting forty-four leaves, was sold at Utterson's\r\n    sale in 1852 to the Earl of Ashburnham for £155.\r\n\r\n11. The English Bible, translated by Myles Coverdale from the Vulgate,\r\nand printed abroad in 1535.\r\n\r\n    This copy of the first complete Bible printed in our language, is\r\n    one of the largest and soundest known to be in existence, although,\r\n    like almost all other copies, it wants the title. It was formerly in\r\n    the possession of Selden. A facsimile title, engraved by Mr. Fry, of\r\n    Bristol, from the Marq. of Northampton's copy, accompanies it,\r\n    together with another leaf in facsimile, from the Earl of\r\n    Leicester's copy. Another and more imperfect copy came to the\r\n    Library among the books bequeathed by Mrs. Denyer. In 1854 a copy\r\n    nearly perfect, having only two leaves in facsimile by Mr. Harris,\r\n    was sold at Mr. Dunn Gardner's sale for the large sum of £364; and a\r\n    very imperfect copy was sold for £190 in 1857.\r\n\r\n12. Hieronymus (_rectius_, Rufinus) _de Symbolo Apostolorum_; printed at\r\nOxford in 1468. See p. 111.\r\n\r\n13. Latin verses in the autograph of Milton. See p. 45.\r\n\r\n14. The original MS. of Addison's _Letter_ (in verse) _from Italy to\r\nLord Halifax_.\r\n\r\n    A Rawlinson MS.\r\n\r\n15. Letter from Alex. Pope to H. Cromwell, Esq.; dated July 15, 1711.\r\n\r\n    The same volume contains various other letters from the same to the\r\n    same, which were printed by Curll in 1727; one by Dryden, three by\r\n    J. Norris of Bemerton, three short notes from Young, and several\r\n    letters by Ladies Hester Pakington and Mary Chudleigh. It belongs to\r\n    the Rawlinson collection of MSS.\r\n\r\n16. Letter from Archbp. Laud to Sir W. Boswell, the English Resident at\r\nthe Hague; dated from Lambeth, Nov. 26, 1638.\r\n\r\n    It refers to libels printed in Holland, and particularly to one\r\n    against Laud, supposed to be then printing at Amsterdam, entitled,\r\n    _The Beast is Wounded_. 'I thanke God I trouble not myselfe much\r\n    with these things; but am very sorry for the Publicke, which suffers\r\n    much by them.' Bought in 1863 at a sale at the Hague for £7 17_s._,\r\n    together with a letter on diplomatic business signed by Sir Thomas\r\n    Bodley, and dated at the Hague, April 11, 1589, which is now bound\r\n    in the same volume.\r\n\r\n17. Archbp. Laud's formal Letter of resignation of his office as\r\nChancellor of the University, signed by himself, and dated from the\r\nTower, June 22, 1641. In Latin; on parchment.\r\n\r\n    Endorsed by Ant. à Wood with this memorandum: 'Given to me by Rob.\r\n    Whorwood, of Oxon, Gent., 29 Feb., 1679[376].'\r\n\r\n18. Lord Clarendon's Letter, resigning the same office upon his going\r\ninto exile; written in a secretary's hand, but signed by himself. Very\r\ntouching and beautiful. It runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n                          'For Mr. Vicechancellor of Oxford.\r\n\r\n    'Good Mr. Vicechancellor,\r\n\r\n    'Having found it necessary to transport myselfe out of England, and\r\n    not knowing when it will please God that I shall returne againe; it\r\n    becomes me to take care that the University may not be without the\r\n    service of a person better able to be of use to them, then I am like\r\n    to be; and I doe therefore hereby surrender the office of Chancellor\r\n    into the hands of the said University, to the end that they make\r\n    choyce of some other person better qualifyed to assist and protect\r\n    them then I am, I am sure he can never be more affectionate to it. I\r\n    desire you, as the last suite I am like to make to you, to believe\r\n    that I doe not fly my Country for guilt, and how passionately soever\r\n    I am pursued, that I have not done any thing to make the University\r\n    ashamed of me, or to repent the good opinion they had once of me,\r\n    and though I must have noe farther mention in your publique\r\n    devotions (which I have alwayes exceedingly valued) I hope I shall\r\n    be alwayes remembred in your private prayers as\r\n\r\n                                'Good Mr. Vicechancellor,\r\n                                    'Your affectionate servant,\r\n                                          'CLARENDON.\r\n\r\n    'Calice, this 7/17 Dec. 1667.'\r\n\r\n19. A volume of the Papers of W. Bridgeman, Under-secretary of State to\r\nJames II (bequeathed to the Library by Dr. R. Rawlinson; _see p. 173_),\r\nopen at a leaf containing the original declaration written and signed by\r\nthe Duke of Monmouth, on the day of his execution, of the nullity of his\r\nclaim to the Crown.\r\n\r\n    The following is a copy:--\r\n\r\n    'I declare y^t y^e title of King was forct upon mee, & y^t it was\r\n    very much contrary to my opinion when I was proclam'd. For y^e\r\n    satisfaction of the world I doe declare that y^e late King told mee\r\n    that Hee was never married to my Mother.\r\n\r\n    'Haveing declar'd this I hope y^t the King who is now will not let\r\n    my Children suffer on this Account. And to this I put my hand this\r\n    fifteenth day of July, 1685.\r\n\r\n                                                    'MONMOUTH.\r\n\r\n    'Declar'd by Himselfe, & sign'd in the presence of us.\r\n\r\n                                          'Fran.

These have been\r\n    frequently printed.\r\n\r\n20. A Sanscrit roll, written at the end of the last century, containing\r\nextracts from the _Bhagavadgita_; with paintings representing the\r\nincarnations of Vishnu, &c.\r\n\r\n    In a wooden case. One of the Frazer MSS.\r\n\r\n21. A magnificent folio volume, containing a series of illustrations of\r\nScripture History from Genesis to Job; written about the beginning of\r\nthe fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n    Each page contains, in double columns, four pairs of miniatures\r\n    painted, in medallion-form, upon a gorgeous ground of gold; the\r\n    first of each pair represents some historical scene, which the\r\n    second treats allegorically, and applies to the condition of the\r\n    Church or of individual Christians. Two other volumes are to be\r\n    found in the British Museum, and in the Imperial Library at Paris.\r\n\r\n22. A small oaken platter, bearing the following inscription: 'This\r\nSalver is part of that Oak in which his Majesty K. Charles the 2d,\r\nConcealed himself from the Rebells, and was given to this University by\r\nMrs. Lætitia Lane.'\r\n\r\n    The donor was the daughter of Col. John Lane, the chief agent in the\r\n    King's escape from Worcester; she died in 1709[377].\r\n\r\n23. Specimen of Javanese writing, being a letter from a Javanese Chief\r\nto the Resident of Soorabaya. The seal bears the date of 1780.\r\n\r\n24. Small specimen of an Arabic MS.\r\n\r\n25. A fragment in large Persian characters.\r\n\r\n26. A specimen of Malabaric writing, upon a palm-leaf, three feet in\r\nlength. 'Aug. 9, 1630. Ex dono Jo. Trefusis, generosi Cornubiensis, e\r\nColl. Exon.'\r\n\r\n27. A Russian painting upon a shell, representing a female saint called\r\nS. Parasceve, ἡ ἁγια Παρασκευη, who is found in the Greek\r\nMenology, but whose history is believed by the Bollandists to be a pious\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\n28. A Hebrew _Bible_, beautifully written in the fourteenth century; in\r\ntriple columns, with the Masoretic commentary written in very minute\r\ncharacters, and frequently in fantastic figures, round each page.\r\n\r\n    One of the Oppenheimer MSS.\r\n\r\n29. _Horæ._ An illuminated MS. of the middle of the fifteenth century,\r\nin 4to., probably by a French scribe and artist.\r\n\r\n    From the Canonici collection.\r\n\r\n30. Another MS. of the _Hours_, in folio, of the fifteenth century,\r\nbeautifully illuminated, with many miniatures varying in the treatment\r\nof some of the scenes which they represent from the common type.\r\n\r\n    Traditionally said, but on what evidence does not appear, to have\r\n    belonged to Henry VIII.\r\n\r\n31. A third fifteenth-century MS. of the _Hours_, in 8vo.\r\n\r\n    From the Rawlinson collection.\r\n\r\n32. A fourth MS. of the _Hours_, very early in the fifteenth century, or\r\nabout the close of the fourteenth.\r\n\r\n    Also from the Rawlinson collection. All these copies of the _Horæ_\r\n    appear to be of French execution.\r\n\r\n33. A pair of long white leather gloves, worked with gold thread, which\r\nwere worn by Queen Elizabeth when she visited the University in\r\n1566[378].\r\n\r\n34. A Latin exercise book, in 4to., which appears to have been filled up\r\nby Edward VI and his sister Elizabeth, jointly.\r\n\r\n    Sentences written by the former are dated from Jan. 1548-9 to Aug.\r\n    1549. The boy-monarch has written his own name in several parts of\r\n    the book. It came to the Bodleian 'ex dono doctissimi viri P. Junii,\r\n    Bibliothecarii Regii, A.D. 1639.' Patrick Young also gave another\r\n    book in Edward's handwriting in folio, containing Greek and Latin\r\n    phrases, written very neatly in 1551-1552[379].\r\n\r\n35. Mexican Hieroglyphics; painted on a long skin of leather.\r\n\r\n36. The Book of _Proverbs_, written by Mrs. Esther Inglis. See p. 48.\r\n\r\n37. Two Runic Primstaves, or wooden Clog-Almanacks: one in the form of a\r\nwalking stick; the other, an oblong block, with a handle. See pp. 105,\r\n161.\r\n\r\n    An engraving of the second may be found in the _Anglican Church\r\n    Calendar illustrated_, published by Messrs. Parker. And a\r\n    description of these primitive Calendars is given by Plot in his\r\n    _Natural History of Staffordshire_, 1686, pp. 418-432, where there\r\n    is an engraving of a Clog which was still in use in Staffordshire at\r\n    that time.\r\n\r\n38. Eight small wooden tablets, apparently a pocket-edition of a\r\nClog-Almanack, with very quaint figures.\r\n\r\n    Given by Archbp. Laud.\r\n\r\n39. The Book of _Enoch_, in Æthiopic. See p. 267.\r\n\r\n40. A Persian poem, by Jami, on the history of Joseph and Potiphar's\r\nwife. Written A.D. 1569, and decorated with some very good paintings and\r\narabesque borders[380].\r\n\r\n    One of Greaves' MSS.\r\n\r\n41. A specimen of Telugu writing on palm-leaves; being an almanack for\r\nthe year 1630.\r\n\r\n    Given by Archbp. Laud.\r\n\r\n42. A French panegyrical poem, presented to Queen Elizabeth, in 1586, by\r\nGeorges de la Motthe, a French refugee; with a prefatory address in\r\nprose.\r\n\r\n    Enriched with an exquisite portrait of the Queen, in all the\r\n    grandeur of her wide circumference, and with golden hair of very\r\n    _prononcée_ hue; and with a great variety of beautifully-executed\r\n    monograms, symbols, &c. around each page. The binding is richly\r\n    tooled and covered with designs; while in the centre on either side,\r\n    protected by glass, are brilliant bosses, said to be composed of\r\n    humming-birds' feathers.\r\n\r\n    'Ex dono ornatissimi, simul ac optimæ spei, juvenis D. Johannis\r\n    Cope, armigeri, equitis aurati, baronetti f. natu maximi, olim\r\n    Reginensis Oxon, Almæ Matris ergô. 4 Cal. Jan. 1626.'\r\n\r\n    On a fly-leaf at the end is attached a fragment from some English\r\n    theological treatise, in wonderfully minute, although clear,\r\n    handwriting.\r\n\r\n43. The _Koran_, on a long and narrow roll, very elegantly written in\r\nminute characters.\r\n\r\n    Given by Archbp. Laud.\r\n\r\n44. A Syriac fragment, on three leaves of paper.\r\n\r\n45. A specimen of Chinese printing, on rice-paper.\r\n\r\n46. A specimen of the Papyrus-plant, in its natural state.\r\n\r\n47. A fine MS. of the _Koran_, from the library of Tippoo Sahib at\r\nSeringapatam.\r\n\r\n    Given by the East India Company in 1806; see p. 208.\r\n\r\n48. A small Egyptian mummy-figure, of baked clay.\r\n\r\n    Given by Archbp. Laud.\r\n\r\n49. A Burmese MS., written in large black characters on thirty-nine\r\ngilded palm-leaves.\r\n\r\n    'Taken from a priest's chest in an idol-house of the deserted\r\n    village of Myanoung, on the Irawaddy, thirty-five miles below Prome,\r\n    April 17, 1825.' Given by Rev. Joseph Dornford, Oriel College, Nov.\r\n    8, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE OPPOSITE, OR NORTH, WING.\r\n\r\nA large glass case containing a series of MSS. executed by English\r\nscribes, arranged chronologically, so as to exhibit the progress and\r\ndevelopment of the arts of caligraphy and illuminating in England. This\r\ncase was added by the present Librarian three or four years ago. The\r\nfollowing are its contents:--\r\n\r\n1. King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon version of the treatise _De cura pastorali_\r\nof Pope Gregory the Great, being the copy sent by the King to Werfrith,\r\nBishop of Worcester.\r\n\r\n    Given by Lord Hatton; see p. 100.\r\n\r\n2. A beautiful Latin _Psalter_ of the tenth century, written in\r\nAnglo-Saxon characters, with an interlinear translation, and decorated\r\nwith grotesque initial letters.\r\n\r\n    Junius MS. 37. The volume is frequently called _Codex Vossianus_,\r\n    from its having been in the possession of Isaac Voss, who gave it to\r\n    Junius. Facsimiles are given by Professor Westwood, in his\r\n    _Palæographia Sacra_, and in his new and splendid book of\r\n    _Fac-similes of the Miniatures and Ornaments of Anglo-Saxon and\r\n    Irish MSS_[381].\r\n\r\n3. The _Four Gospels_, in Latin, written in Anglo-Saxon characters,\r\nabout the beginning of the eleventh century.\r\n\r\n    Noticed in Westwood's _Miniatures_, &c. (_ut supra_), p. 123.\r\n\r\n    It appears to have belonged to the abbey at Barking, a gift of\r\n    tithes at Laleseie, by Adam, son of Leomar de Cochefeld, being\r\n    entered on a leaf at the end by order of the abbess Ælfgiva. Now\r\n    numbered Bodl. 155.\r\n\r\n4. The famous _Anglo-Saxon metrical paraphrase_ of parts of Genesis,\r\nExodus, Daniel, &c. by Cædmon[382]; illustrated, as far as Abraham's\r\njourney into Egypt, with a very curious series of drawings.\r\n\r\n    The MS. is considered to have been written about A.D. 1000. The\r\n    latest description of the volume is in Westwood's magnificent book\r\n    of _Fac-similes_. See p. 102.\r\n\r\n5. The _Psalter_, _Canticles_, &c., in Latin, with a Calendar; written in\r\nthe first half of the eleventh century.\r\n\r\n    Noticed in Westwood's _Miniatures and Ornaments_, &c., p. 122. Douce,\r\n    296.\r\n\r\n6. A twelfth-century volume containing, besides various historical\r\nworks, a _Bestiary_, or Natural History of Beasts, illustrated with very\r\ncurious drawings.\r\n\r\n    Given by Archbp. Laud.\r\n\r\n7. A _Bestiary_ of the beginning of the thirteenth century, enriched\r\nwith many very curious paintings upon a ground of brilliant gold.\r\n\r\n    Ashmole, 1511.\r\n\r\n8. Another _Bestiary_, of slightly later date, illuminated in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n    Bodl. 764.\r\n\r\n9. The _Apocalypse_, illustrated in a series of very curious drawings,\r\nlightly coloured. Executed about 1250.\r\n\r\n    These illuminations have been pronounced by Mr. Coxe, to be, with\r\n    little or no doubt, executed by the same hand as those of MS. Ee.\r\n    III. 59. in the University Library, Cambridge, a volume which\r\n    contains a Life of Edward the Confessor, in French verse, and which\r\n    was printed in 1858, under the editorship of H. R. Luard, M.A., in\r\n    the series of Chronicles published under the authority of the Master\r\n    of the Rolls. In this Life is found a particular description of\r\n    Westminster Abbey, which is not elsewhere met with, and it is\r\n    consequently inferred that the writer was a monk of that church. And\r\n    in the course of the restorations which are now being carried on in\r\n    the Chapter House (which was built about 1250), a series of mural\r\n    paintings, illustrating the history of St. John, has been brought to\r\n    light, one of which is a representation similar to that in the\r\n    Bodley MS. of St. John 'ante portam Latinam,' and in both cases the\r\n    cauldron bears the same inscription of '_Dolium_ ferventis olei.'\r\n\r\n10. A _Primer_, written about the middle of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n    The arms of Edw. III (England 1 and 4, France 2 and 3) are painted\r\n    on the first leaf. One of Rawlinson's MSS.\r\n\r\n11. A beautiful _Psalter_, which belonged to Peterborough Cathedral.\r\n\r\n    'Psalterium fratris Walteri de Rouceby,' followed by the Canticles,\r\n    Athanasian Creed, Litany, &c. A Calendar is prefixed, with\r\n    Peterborough obits, from which it appears that Rouceby died May 4,\r\n    1341. A series of nineteen miniatures, illustrating the life of our\r\n    Blessed Lord and of the Virgin Mary, precedes the Psalter. The arms\r\n    of Edward III appear at the head of Ps. i. One of Bp. Barlow's MSS.;\r\n    in 1604 it belonged to one John Harborne.\r\n\r\n12. A _Psalter_, with Canticles, Hymns, &c., written in the latter half\r\nof the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n    Apparently one of Rawlinson's MSS.\r\n\r\n13. '_Ye Dreme of Pilgrimage of ye Soule_, translated out of French [of\r\nG. Guilevile] into Inglissh, with somwhat of addicions of ye\r\ntranslatour, ye zeere of our Lord, 1400.' Illustrated with curious\r\ncoloured drawings.\r\n\r\n    A precursor of Bunyan's _Pilgrim's Progress_, with which it has been\r\n    compared. It was printed by Caxton in 1483, and his edition was\r\n    reprinted in 1859.\r\n\r\n    This MS. was given to the Library, apparently in Bodley's time, by\r\n    Sir James Lee, Knt.\r\n\r\n14. _Commentary on the Passion of our B. Lord_ ('Scripta super totam\r\nPassionem Christi a quatuor Evangelistis formatam'), by Michael de\r\nMassa, of the order of Augustinian Hermits.\r\n\r\n    Written (as a final colophon records) by Ralph de Medyltone at\r\n    Ingham (Suffolk?), A.D. 1405, for Sir Miles de Stapiltone. A\r\n    drawing of the Crucifixion at the beginning. Bodl. MS. 758.\r\n\r\n15. '_The Mirroure of the Worlde_, that some calleth Vice and Vertu;'\r\ntranslated from the Latin of Laurence the Frenchman (Laur. Gallus), and\r\nillustrated with some drawings of remarkable grace and spirit, supposed\r\nto be by some Flemish artist.\r\n\r\n    A MS. of the early part of the fifteenth century; on paper. Bodl.\r\n    283.\r\n\r\n16. _Horæ_, formerly in the possession of Queen Mary I. See p. 42.\r\n\r\n17. _Treatise of Roger Bacon_, 'de retardacione accidentium senectutis;'\r\nwith two drawings. Middle of the fifteenth century. Bodl. MS. 211.\r\n\r\n18. An English astrological Calendar, in six divisions, folded for the\r\npocket; written in the latter half of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n    Extremely curious; contains prognostications of the weather,\r\n    fatality of the seasons, &c., accompanied with innumerable figures of\r\n    saints, illustrations of prognostics, the symbols found on the Runic\r\n    Clog-Almanacks, the occupations of the several months, the signs of\r\n    the Zodiac, and two quaint figures respectively labelled 'Harry ye\r\n    Haywarde' with his dog 'Talbat,' and 'Peris ye Pyndare.' Formerly\r\n    kept in a tin box. It contains the following note by T. Hearne:\r\n    'Oct. 17, 1719. This strange odd book (upon which I set a very great\r\n    value, having never seen the like) was given me by the Rt. Reverend\r\n    Father in God William [Fleetwood] Lord Bishop of Ely, to whom I am\r\n    oblig'd upon many other accounts.'\r\n\r\n19. An _Historical Roll_, upwards of thirteen feet long, showing the\r\ndescent of the English Kings, from the expedition of Jason in search of\r\nthe Golden Fleece to the accession of Edward I (1272). Formerly\r\nbelonging to the Abbey of St. Mary at York.\r\n\r\n    Illustrated with representations of various scenes up to the landing\r\n    of Brute in the Isle of Wight, and thenceforward with portraits of\r\n    the monarchs.\r\n\r\n20. _Map of the Holy Land_, on a paper roll, nearly seven feet long;\r\nwritten, apparently, in the first half of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n    In the Douce collection. Engraved in facsimile during the past year,\r\n    1867, for the Roxburghe Club, to illustrate the Itineraries of\r\n    William Wey, which were edited by Rev. G. Williams, B.D., for the\r\n    same Club, from Bodl. MS. 565, in 1857. The Map in many points\r\n    agrees very closely with the latter, but contains also some\r\n    discrepancies, and is somewhat earlier in date.\r\n\r\n21. A _Psalter_, with the usual Canticles, Litany, &c; written about the\r\nmiddle of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n    This magnificent volume was given by Robert de Ormesby, a monk of\r\n    Norwich, to the choir of the Cathedral Church, 'ad jacendum coram\r\n    Suppriore qui pro tempore fuerit inperpetuum.' It is illustrated\r\n    with illuminations most beautifully executed, but, at the same\r\n    time, containing the most grotesque and profanely inappropriate\r\n    figures, resembling those sometimes found on the _Misereres_ of\r\n    collegiate churches. It is bound in a large covering of sheepskin,\r\n    which by overlapping the volume has no doubt greatly contributed to\r\n    preserve its freshness and beauty of condition. A facsimile from one\r\n    page is to be found in Shaw's _Illuminated Ornaments_, 1833, with a\r\n    description by Sir F. Madden. It belongs to the Douce collection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a separate glass case adjoining the preceding (in which was formerly\r\nexhibited a fine specimen of the typography of the Royal Press at\r\nBerlin, in a German Bible given by the King of Prussia) is now displayed\r\na fine Bible printed at Glasgow in 1862, in two folio volumes, and\r\nillustrated with very beautiful photographs by Frith, which was called\r\nthe Queen's Bible from its being dedicated by permission to Her Majesty.\r\n\r\nIn a glass case in the adjoining window is a German Bible, printed in\r\n1541, with texts on the fly-leaves in the handwriting of Luther and\r\nMelanchthon, whose signatures, although much defaced by some possessor,\r\nare still very legible. See p. 245.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN A GLASS CASE, WEST END OF THE LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n1. _Plinii Historia Naturalis_; in folio. Printed 1476.\r\n\r\n    From the Douce collection. See p. 250.\r\n\r\n2. _Breviary_ and Psalter according to the use of the Carthusian Order;\r\nwritten about 1480.\r\n\r\n    A specimen of Italian art, from the Canonici collection.\r\n\r\n3. _Horæ B. M. Virg._ 12mo. An exquisite MS., of the school of Albert\r\nDurer, executed for Bona Sforza. See p. 249.\r\n\r\n4. _Psalter_, on purple vellum, written about the close of the ninth\r\ncentury. From the old library of the kings of France. See p. 249.\r\n\r\n    A MS. of the _Horæ_, written on purple vellum, about 1500, is among\r\n    the Canonici MSS.\r\n\r\n5. _Boccaccio's Il Filocalo_; in folio, of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n    A beautiful MS., with five exquisite miniatures, and interlaced\r\n    arabesque borders of the richest character. A facsimile, with a\r\n    notice of the book, will be found in Shaw's _Illuminated Ornaments_.\r\n    From the Canonici collection.\r\n\r\n6. _Horæ_, quarto; fourteenth century. A beautiful book.\r\n\r\n    From the Douce collection.\r\n\r\n7. _Horæ_, small quarto; end of the fifteenth century. The illuminations\r\npossess exquisite softness and delicacy.\r\n\r\n    Also from the Douce collection.\r\n\r\n8. _The Miracles of the B. Virgin_, in French.

Si aliquid hoc\r\n    tempore haberem (Serenissime Rex) quod mihi ad dandum esset\r\n    accommodatum, & Maiestati tuæ congruens ad accipiendum, equidem de\r\n    hac re vehementer lætarer. Tua Maiestas res magnas & excellentes\r\n    meretur, et mea facultas exigua tantum suppeditare potest, sed\r\n    quamvis facultate possim minima, tamen animo tibi maxima prestare\r\n    cupio, & quum ab aliis opibus superer, a nemine amore & benevolentia\r\n    vincor. Ita iubet natura, authoritas tua commouet, & bonitas me\r\n    hortatur, ut cum princeps meus sis te officio obseruem, & cum frater\r\n    meus sis vnicus & amantissimus, intimo amore afficiam. Ecce autem\r\n    pro huius noui anni felici auspicio, & observantiæ meæ testimonio,\r\n    offero M. T. breuem istam Bernardi Ochini orationem, ab eo Italicè\r\n    primum scriptam, & a me in latinum sermonem conuersum. Argumentum\r\n    quum de Christo sit, bene conuenire tibi potest, qui quotidie\r\n    Christum discis, & post eum in terris proximum locum & dignitatem\r\n    habes. Tractatio ita pia est & docta, ut lectio non possit non esse\r\n    vtilis et fructuosa. Et si nihil aliud commendaret opus, authoritas\r\n    scriptoris ornaret satis, qui propter religionem et Christum patria\r\n    expulsus, cogitur in locis peregrinis & inter ignotos homines vitam\r\n    traducere. Si quicquam in eo mediocre sit, mea translatio est, quæ\r\n    profecto talis non est qualis esse debet, sed qualis a me effici\r\n    posset. At istarum rerum omnium M. tua inter legendum iudex sit, cui\r\n    ego hunc meum laborem commendo, & vna meipsam etiam dedico, Deumque\r\n    precor vt M. tua multos nouos & felices annos videat & lucris ac\r\n    pietate perpetuo crescat. Enfeldiæ, 30 Decembris.\r\n\r\n  'Maiestatis tuæ,\r\n  'humill. soror,\r\n  '& serua,\r\n  'Elizabeta.'\r\n\r\n16.

A small copper figure of our Blessed Lord, crowned and robed,\r\n        with eyes open, and arms extended.\r\n\r\n      The following account is given by Hearne in a volume of his MS.\r\n        collections[385]:--\r\n\r\n      'About five years since the workmen in digging the gardens that\r\n        formerly belong'd to St. Frideswyd's, Oxford, found a crucifix;\r\n        the figure in pontifical robes, enamelled and gilt, with stones\r\n        in the arms and breast. It came afterwards into the hands of Mr.\r\n        Edw. Thwaites of Queen's College, who gave it to the Bodleian\r\n        Library, where in the Physick schoole 'tis now reserved, and\r\n        seems to be very ancient.'\r\n\r\n      A drawing of the figure made for Thwaites by J. T. [alman] lies\r\n        beside it, which was given to the Library by the late Dr.\r\n        Wellesley. The figure resembles a crucifix found at Lucca, of\r\n        the seventh century.\r\n\r\n21. _Psalterium_; close of thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n    Bound in solid silver, on which are engraved the Annunciation and\r\n    the Coronation of the Blessed Virgin, seen beneath a coloured\r\n    transparency which gives an appearance of great richness to the\r\n    otherwise uncoloured silver.\r\n\r\n    A beautifully decorated volume, given by Sir Rob.

One of the round sets\r\n        belonged, in 1599, to Queen Elizabeth. The verses are sometimes\r\n        humorous, sometimes moral, and strongly dehortatory from\r\n        marriage; not, however, out of any flattering deference to the\r\n        condition or supposed inclination of the 'Virgin Queen,' but\r\n        chiefly in accordance with the opposite view taken by some\r\n        hard-hearted misogynist. Of the two classes of motto, let these\r\n        stand as  specimens:--\r\n\r\n    'If that a bachelor thou bee\r\n    Keepe thou so, still be ruled by mee,\r\n    Leaste that repentance all to late\r\n    Reward thee with a broken pate.'\r\n\r\n    'Content thyselfe with thyn estate,\r\n    And send noo poor wight from thi gate:\r\n    For why this councell I thee give\r\n    To learne to die and die to lyve.'\r\n\r\n    iv.

Model, in wood, of the Temple at Pæstum.\r\n\r\n    Carved by Mr. Thomas Wyatt, of Oxford, about 1830.\r\n\r\n[374] Many autographs of distinguished literary men are found in the old\r\nRegisters of all the persons admitted to read in the Library, since in\r\nthese the readers themselves generally entered their own names. The\r\nfirst 'Liber admissorum' contains the names of both graduates and\r\nnon-academics, the names in the first case being only in part autograph;\r\nit commences about the year 1610, and ends, in the case of graduates,\r\narranged under their several colleges, about 1676; in the case of\r\nstrangers, at 1692. The second Register, which is 'peregrinorum et\r\naliorum admissorum' alone, begins at 1682 and ends at 1833. The first\r\nexisting register of books used by readers begins Jan. 3, 1647-8, and\r\nends Dec. 30, 1649.

Laud, and the other being that called the Fifth by\r\nSotheby, but 'Editio princeps' by Heinecken, which was bought in 1853\r\nfor £120 5_s._ Other Block-books in the Library are, (1) two editions of\r\nthe _Biblia Pauperum_, or Scenes from Bible History; one coloured, the\r\nother (which belonged to Douce) uncoloured; (2) the _Historia B. M. V.\r\nex Cantico Canticorum_, being the edition called the Second by Sotheby;\r\n(3) _Propugnacula, seu Turris Sapientiæ_, a broadside, bought in 1853\r\nfor six guineas. A facsimile of this is given in vol. ii. of Sotheby's\r\n_Principia_; (4) _Speculum Humanæ Salvationis._ In this book, which is\r\nthe second Latin edition of the work (formerly described as the _Editio\r\nprinceps_), twenty pages are taken off from wood-blocks, and the rest\r\nfrom moveable type. The copy belonged to Douce. It came previously 'ex\r\nMusæo Pauli Girardot de Prefond,' but is not mentioned in De Bure's\r\ncatalogue of that library, published in 1757. It is said that a copy of\r\nthis book has been sold for the large sum of 300 guineas.\r\n\r\n[376] A touching letter, in English, dated June 28, which Laud\r\nforwarded, together with this formal document, is printed in vol. ii. of\r\nWharton's edition of his _Remains_, p. 217. In the same volume are\r\nincluded copies of all the letters which accompanied the Archbishop's\r\ngifts to the Library. The following reply (_ibid._ p. 177) to a\r\nnotification from the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Frewen, of the visitation of\r\nhis collection, and of the giving special charge to the Librarian\r\nrespecting their safe custody, seeing that they stood unchained, and in\r\na place frequented by strangers who came to see them, should have been\r\nnoticed in its due place in the _Annals_.\r\n\r\n  'SIR,\r\n\r\n    'I thank you heartily for your care of my books. And I beseech you\r\n    that the Library-keeper may be very watchful to look to them since\r\n    they stand unchain'd. And I would to God the place in the Library\r\n    for them were once ready, that they might be set up safe, and\r\n    chained as the other books are; and yet then, if there be not care\r\n    taken, you may have some of the best and choisest tractats cut out\r\n    of the covers and purloin'd, as hath been done in some other\r\n    libraries.'\r\n\r\n                                    'W.

VI_, printed by the Roxburghe Club in 1857 (vol. i. pp.\r\ncccxxiii-cccxxv), describes these volumes at length, and assigns the\r\nwhole of both of them to the pen of the King, but some part of the first\r\nvolume corresponds much more closely with the usual style of Elizabeth's\r\nearly writing, and a memorandum by Hearne testifies that it was regarded\r\nin his day as having been written by her.\r\n\r\n[380] 'The poem of Joseph and Zuleikha, in the Public Library at Oxford,\r\nis perhaps the most beautiful MS. in the world; the margins of every\r\npage are gilt and adorned with garlands of flowers, and the handwriting\r\nis elegant to the highest degree.' (I. Disraeli's _Romances_, 1799, p.\r\n52.)\r\n\r\n[381] This book, which has appeared since the earlier sheets of this\r\nvolume were printed, contains descriptions, with facsimiles, of the\r\nLeofric, Dunstan, and Mac-Regol MSS. and of the Rawlinsonian Life of St.\r\nColumba, besides those noticed above.\r\n\r\n[382] Cædmon was a monk of St. Hilda's Abbey, and died in 680. Bede\r\n(_Eccl. Hist._ iv. 24) tells the well-known story of his being\r\nmiraculously enabled by a vision to compose vernacular verses, when\r\npreviously he had been entirely unable to compose or sing a line, so\r\nthat when present as a layman at feasts where, on the principle of 'no\r\nsong, no supper,' every one was expected to raise a lay in his turn, he\r\nwas wont, when he saw the harp coming round, to rise from his place and\r\ngo home supperless.\r\n\r\n[383] This MS. is noticed by Warton in his _Life of Sir T. Pope_, p. 73,\r\nwhere he also quotes Hearne's account of Elizabeth's New Testament,\r\nwhich is described at p. 52 _supra_.\r\n\r\n[384] Lent to the South Kensington Museum in 1862, from the catalogue of\r\nwhich exhibition (under No. 202) the above description is taken.\r\n\r\n[385] Rawlinson, C. 876, f. 52.\r\n\r\n[386] _Catalogue of the South Kensington Exhibition_, 1862, p. 672.\r\n\r\n[387] Another specimen of Mr. Rassam's caligraphic skill is to be seen\r\nin the Common Room of Magdalene College (in which College he was\r\nentertained for some time), where the College arms are represented in\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\n[388] Besides some restorations from the Randolph Gallery of portraits\r\nformerly removed thither.\r\n\r\n[389] An engraving of a roundel (then, with others, in the possession of\r\nJohn Fenton of Fishguard) of which the exact counterpart is found in one\r\nof these sets, is given in the _Gent. Magaz._ for 1799, p. 465. As it is\r\nnot known how long the Library has been in possession of its present\r\ncollection, it is possible that Mr. Fenton's series may now be included\r\nin it. A description of a set of the time of James I may be found in\r\nvol. xxxiv of the _Archæologia_, pp. 225-230; and a notice of the\r\nBodleian trenchers in _Notes and Queries_, 1866, p. 472, and other\r\ncommunications on the subject in the first volume for 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Numismatic Collection._\r\n\r\nThe collection of Coins and Medals was commenced by the gift from\r\nArchbishop Laud of five cabinets of coins, in 1636[390], to which he\r\nsubsequently made some additions. These were accompanied by a very full\r\nMS. catalogue, which is now preserved among Laud's MSS., No. 554. In\r\n1657 a large addition was made by Mr. Ralph Freke (see p. 88), and\r\nnumerous small gifts came from many donors in following years. A\r\ncatalogue, upon which Francis Wise had been engaged for a long period,\r\nwas published by him in a folio volume, in 1750, entitled, _Nummorum\r\nantiquorum scriniis Bodleianis reconditorum catalogus, cum commentario,\r\ntabulis æneis et appendice_. Wise remarks in his Preface, that no\r\ndonation, however trifling, was rejected, and that, consequently, there\r\nwas (as there is still) a very large quantity of Middle and Third brass\r\ncoins of little or no value. From Rawlinson there came, in 1755, besides\r\ncoins, a collection of Italian medals (Popes, Medici family, &c.), and\r\nnumerous matrices of seals, chiefly foreign. Browne Willis contributed\r\nthe most valuable portion of the whole collection, in his series of gold\r\nand silver English coins[391].\r\n\r\nSubsequent benefactors have been C. Godwyn, in 1770; Douce, whose\r\ncollection included those of Calder, Moore, and Keate, and from whom\r\ncame a series of Tradesmen's Tokens; Dr. Ingram, in 1850, whose bequest\r\nincluded some British specimens; the Queen, who gave, in 1841, a portion\r\nof the treasure found at Cuerdale (see p. 264); Mackie, Roberts,\r\nElliott, whose valuable series of Indo-Bactrian coins was presented in\r\n1860 (see p. 291), and Dr. Caulfield of Cork, who presented in 1866 a\r\nlarge collection of the Gun-money struck by James II in Ireland. The\r\nAshmole coins were transferred from the Museum, together with Ashmole's\r\nlibrary, in 1861. There is also a cabinet of Napoleon medals.\r\n\r\nNo catalogue of any portion of the contents of this room (excepting a\r\nbrief description of the Cuerdale coins) has been issued since the\r\npublication of Wise's volume. For some short time past, however, W. S.\r\nVaux, Esq., of the British Museum, has occasionally afforded his\r\nvaluable services in arrangement and description; and it is hoped that\r\nbefore long the whole of the collection may be reduced to order and\r\nproperly indexed.\r\n\r\nBy the statutes of the Library, the Librarian, or one of the\r\nSub-librarians, must always be present when any coins are exhibited; nor\r\nmay they be shown to more than two persons at a time, unless two\r\nofficers of the Library, or a Curator, are present. No examination of\r\ncoins for the purpose of comparison with other specimens is permitted.\r\n\r\n[390] Amongst these are several rare Hebrew specimens. Laud's letter of\r\ngift, dated June 16, is printed at p. 94, vol. ii., of his _Remains_,\r\nedited by H. Wharton. A curious collection of Roman weights came among\r\nearly benefactions; they are entered in Wise's catalogue.\r\n\r\n[391] The special gems are a gold Allectus, and the famous _Reddite_ and\r\n_Petition_ crowns of Thomas Simon, the latter of which was struck in\r\n1663. The Petition crown is probably the one which was sold in Dr.\r\nMead's sale in February, 1755 (_Cat._ p. 186), and which is noted by\r\nRawlinson in his copy of the sale catalogue as having been purchased\r\nby -- Hodsall for £12. A gold Allectus was sold at the same sale to the\r\nDuke of Devonshire for £21 5_s._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Past Librarians._\r\n\r\n  1598.

Holland's _Oratio Sarisb. babita_, which records that it came to the\r\nLibrary in that year: 'Ex dono Johannis Vernulii, hypobibliothecarii.'\r\n\r\n[393] His name first appears in 1746 as making out the accounts and\r\nreceiving money.\r\n\r\n[394] The reference to the source whence this quotation was taken has\r\nbeen lost.\r\n\r\n[395] See Nichols' _Lit.

It is closed from\r\nChristmas Eve to the Feast of the Circumcision, both inclusive; on the\r\nEpiphany; on Good Friday, Easter Eve, and through the whole of Easter\r\nweek; on Ascension Day; on Whit-Monday and Whit-Tuesday; on the day of\r\nthe University Commemoration; for the first week in October (Oct. 1-7),\r\nfor purposes of dusting and cleaning; and on Nov. 7th and 8th (or Nov.\r\n6-7th, should the 8th fall on a Sunday) for the Visitation.\r\n\r\nOn other festival days, being days for which services are appointed in\r\nthe Prayer-Book, and on which Sermons are, consequently, preached before\r\nthe University, as well as on the days of Latin Litany and Sermon (viz.\r\nthe first day of each Term), the Library is opened when the Sermon is\r\nover, _i.e._ ordinarily at 11 o'clock.\r\n\r\nAll graduate members of the University have the right to use the\r\nLibrary. Undergraduates are admitted upon bringing letters of\r\nrecommendation from their Tutors. Strangers are admitted upon being\r\nintroduced by a Master of Arts or higher graduate, or upon producing\r\nsufficient letters of introduction; but every facility is afforded to\r\nstrangers who make personal application to the Librarian for permission\r\nto make researches for any definite and special purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Library is under the control of a Board of Curators, consisting of\r\nthe Vice-Chancellor, the two Proctors, the five Regius Professors of\r\nDivinity, Civil Law, Medicine, Hebrew, and Greek, and five Members of\r\nCongregation, elected by that House for ten years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Camera Radcliviana_, formerly the Radcliffe Library, is open all\r\nthe year round from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.; excepting that it is closed\r\nduring the same periods at which the old Library is closed. In it are to\r\nbe found most of the publications of the last sixteen years, with the\r\nmost recent magazines; and books from the general collection may be\r\ncarried over for use there, upon proper application.\r\n\r\nThe Statutes of the Library are printed in the general _Corpus\r\nStatutorum Universitatis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ABBOT, Archbp., 36.\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Robert, 36.\r\n\r\n  Abel-Remusat, J.
