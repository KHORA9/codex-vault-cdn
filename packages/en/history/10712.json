The gash being made, a metamorphosis\r\ntook place, transcending any related by Ovid. For, presto! the shirt\r\nwas a coat!—a strange-looking coat, to be sure; of a Quakerish\r\namplitude about the skirts; with an infirm, tumble-down collar; and a\r\nclumsy fullness about the wristbands; and white, yea, white as a\r\nshroud. And my shroud it afterward came very near proving, as he who\r\nreads further will find.\r\n\r\nBut, bless me, my friend, what sort of a summer jacket is this, in\r\nwhich to weather Cape Horn? A very tasty, and beautiful white linen\r\ngarment it may have seemed; but then, people almost universally sport\r\ntheir linen next to their skin.\r\n\r\nVery true; and that thought very early occurred to me; for no idea had\r\nI of scudding round Cape Horn in my shirt; for _that_ would have been\r\nalmost scudding under bare poles, indeed.\r\n\r\nSo, with many odds and ends of patches—old socks, old trowser-legs, and\r\nthe like—I bedarned and bequilted the inside of my jacket, till it\r\nbecame, all over, stiff and padded, as King James’s cotton-stuffed and\r\ndagger-proof doublet; and no buckram or steel hauberk stood up more\r\nstoutly.\r\n\r\nSo far, very good; but pray, tell me, White-Jacket, how do you propose\r\nkeeping out the rain and the wet in this quilted _grego_ of yours? You\r\ndon’t call this wad of old patches a Mackintosh, do you?——you don’t\r\npretend to say that worsted is water-proof?\r\n\r\nNo, my dear friend; and that was the deuce of it. Waterproof it was\r\nnot, no more than a sponge. Indeed, with such recklessness had I\r\nbequilted my jacket, that in a rain-storm I became a universal\r\nabsorber; swabbing bone-dry the very bulwarks I leaned against. Of a\r\ndamp day, my heartless shipmates even used to stand up against me, so\r\npowerful was the capillary attraction between this luckless jacket of\r\nmine and all drops of moisture. I dripped like a turkey a roasting; and\r\nlong after the rain storms were over, and the sun showed his face, I\r\nstill stalked a Scotch mist; and when it was fair weather with others,\r\nalas! it was foul weather with me.\r\n\r\n_Me?_ Ah me! Soaked and heavy, what a burden was that jacket to carry\r\nabout, especially when I was sent up aloft; dragging myself up step by\r\nstep, as if I were weighing the anchor. Small time then, to strip, and\r\nwring it out in a rain, when no hanging back or delay was permitted.\r\nNo, no; up you go: fat or lean: Lambert or Edson: never mind how much\r\navoirdupois you might weigh. And thus, in my own proper person, did\r\nmany showers of rain reascend toward the skies, in accordance with the\r\nnatural laws.\r\n\r\nBut here be it known, that I had been terribly disappointed in carrying\r\nout my original plan concerning this jacket. It had been my intention\r\nto make it thoroughly impervious, by giving it a coating of paint, But\r\nbitter fate ever overtakes us unfortunates. So much paint had been\r\nstolen by the sailors, in daubing their overhaul trowsers and\r\ntarpaulins, that by the time I—an honest man—had completed my\r\nquiltings, the paint-pots were banned, and put under strict lock and\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nSaid old Brush, the captain of the _paint-room_—“Look ye,\r\nWhite-Jacket,” said he, “ye can’t have any paint.”\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was my jacket: a well-patched, padded, and porous one; and\r\nin a dark night, gleaming white as the White Lady of Avenel!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nHOMEWARD BOUND.\r\n\r\n\r\n“All hands up anchor! Man the capstan!”\r\n\r\n“High die! my lads, we’re homeward bound!”\r\n\r\nHomeward bound!—harmonious sound! Were you _ever_ homeward\r\nbound?—No?—Quick! take the wings of the morning, or the sails of a\r\nship, and fly to the uttermost parts of the earth. There, tarry a year\r\nor two; and then let the gruffest of boatswains, his lungs all\r\ngoose-skin, shout forth those magical words, and you’ll swear “the harp\r\nof Orpheus were not more enchanting.”\r\n\r\nAll was ready; boats hoisted in, stun’ sail gear rove, messenger\r\npassed, capstan-bars in their places, accommodation-ladder below; and\r\nin glorious spirits, we sat down to dinner. In the ward-room, the\r\nlieutenants were passing round their oldest port, and pledging their\r\nfriends; in the steerage, the _middies_ were busy raising loans to\r\nliquidate the demands of their laundress, or else—in the navy\r\nphrase—preparing to pay their creditors _with a flying fore-topsail_.\r\nOn the poop, the captain was looking to windward; and in his grand,\r\ninaccessible cabin, the high and mighty commodore sat silent and\r\nstately, as the statue of Jupiter in Dodona.\r\n\r\nWe were all arrayed in our best, and our bravest; like strips of blue\r\nsky, lay the pure blue collars of our frocks upon our shoulders; and\r\nour pumps were so springy and playful, that we danced up and down as we\r\ndined.\r\n\r\nIt was on the gun-deck that our dinners were spread; all along between\r\nthe guns; and there, as we cross-legged sat, you would have thought a\r\nhundred farm-yards and meadows were nigh. Such a cackling of ducks,\r\nchickens, and ganders; such a lowing of oxen, and bleating of lambkins,\r\npenned up here and there along the deck, to provide sea repasts for the\r\nofficers. More rural than naval were the sounds; continually reminding\r\neach mother’s son of the old paternal homestead in the green old clime;\r\nthe old arching elms; the hill where we gambolled; and down by the\r\nbarley banks of the stream where we bathed.\r\n\r\n“All hands up anchor!”\r\n\r\nWhen that order was given, how we sprang to the bars, and heaved round\r\nthat capstan; every man a Goliath, every tendon a hawser!—round and\r\nround—round, round it spun like a sphere, keeping time with our feet to\r\nthe time of the fifer, till the cable was straight up and down, and the\r\nship with her nose in the water.\r\n\r\n“Heave and pall! unship your bars, and make sail!”\r\n\r\nIt was done: barmen, nipper-men, tierers, veerers, idlers and all,\r\nscrambled up the ladder to the braces and halyards; while like monkeys\r\nin Palm-trees, the sail-loosers ran out on those broad boughs, our\r\nyards; and down fell the sails like white clouds from the\r\nether—topsails, top-gallants, and royals; and away we ran with the\r\nhalyards, till every sheet was distended.\r\n\r\n“Once more to the bars!”\r\n\r\n“Heave, my hearties, heave hard!”\r\n\r\nWith a jerk and a yerk, we broke ground; and up to our bows came\r\nseveral thousand pounds of old iron, in the shape of our ponderous\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\nWhere was White-Jacket then?\r\n\r\nWhite-Jacket was where he belonged. It was White-Jacket that loosed\r\nthat main-royal, so far up aloft there, it looks like a white\r\nalbatross’ wing. It was White-Jacket that was taken for an albatross\r\nhimself, as he flew out on the giddy yard-arm!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nA GLANCE AT THE PRINCIPAL DIVISIONS,\r\nINTO WHICH A MAN-OF-WAR’S CREW IS DIVIDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving just designated the place where White-Jacket belonged, it must\r\nneeds be related how White-Jacket came to belong there.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that in merchantmen the seamen are divided into\r\nwatches—starboard and larboard—taking their turn at the ship’s duty by\r\nnight. This plan is followed in all men-of-war. But in all men-of-war,\r\nbesides this division, there are others, rendered indispensable from\r\nthe great number of men, and the necessity of precision and discipline.\r\nNot only are particular bands assigned to the three _tops_, but in\r\ngetting under weigh, or any other proceeding requiring all hands,\r\nparticular men of these bands are assigned to each yard of the tops.\r\nThus, when the order is given to loose the main-royal, White-Jacket\r\nflies to obey it; and no one but him.\r\n\r\nAnd not only are particular bands stationed on the three decks of the\r\nship at such times, but particular men of those bands are also assigned\r\nto particular duties. Also, in tacking ship, reefing top-sails, or\r\n“coming to,” every man of a frigate’s five-hundred-strong, knows his\r\nown special place, and is infallibly found there. He sees nothing else,\r\nattends to nothing else, and will stay there till grim death or an\r\nepaulette orders him away. Yet there are times when, through the\r\nnegligence of the officers, some exceptions are found to this rule. A\r\nrather serious circumstance growing out of such a case will be related\r\nin some future chapter.\r\n\r\nWere it not for these regulations a man-of-war’s crew would be nothing\r\nbut a mob, more ungovernable stripping the canvas in a gale than Lord\r\nGeorge Gordon’s tearing down the lofty house of Lord Mansfield.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Besides White-Jacket’s office as looser of the\r\nmain-royal, when all hands were called to make sail; and besides his\r\nspecial offices, in tacking ship, coming to anchor, etc.; he\r\npermanently belonged to the Starboard Watch, one of the two primary,\r\ngrand divisions of the ship’s company. And in this watch he was a\r\nmaintop-man; that is, was stationed in the main-top, with a number of\r\nother seamen, always in readiness to execute any orders pertaining to\r\nthe main-mast, from above the main-yard. For, including the main-yard,\r\nand below it to the deck, the main-mast belongs to another detachment.\r\n\r\nNow the fore, main, and mizen-top-men of each watch—Starboard and\r\nLarboard—are at sea respectively subdivided into Quarter Watches; which\r\nregularly relieve each other in the tops to which they may belong;\r\nwhile, collectively, they relieve the whole Larboard Watch of top-men.\r\n\r\nBesides these topmen, who are always made up of active sailors, there\r\nare Sheet-Anchor-men—old veterans all—whose place is on the forecastle;\r\nthe fore-yard, anchors, and all the sails on the bowsprit being under\r\ntheir care.\r\n\r\nThey are an old weather-beaten set, culled from the most experienced\r\nseamen on board. These are the fellows that sing you “_The Bay of\r\nBiscay Oh!_” and “_Here a sheer hulk lies poor Torn Bowling!_” “_Cease,\r\nrude Boreas, blustering railer!_” who, when ashore, at an eating-house,\r\ncall for a bowl of tar and a biscuit. These are the fellows who spin\r\ninterminable yarns about Decatur, Hull, and Bainbridge; and carry about\r\ntheir persons bits of “Old Ironsides,” as Catholics do the wood of the\r\ntrue cross. These are the fellows that some officers never pretend to\r\ndamn, however much they may anathematize others. These are the fellows\r\nthat it does your soul good to look at;—hearty old members of the Old\r\nGuard; grim sea grenadiers, who, in tempest time, have lost many a\r\ntarpaulin overboard. These are the fellows whose society some of the\r\nyoungster midshipmen much affect; from whom they learn their best\r\nseamanship; and to whom they look up as veterans; if so be, that they\r\nhave any reverence in their souls, which is not the case with all\r\nmidshipmen.\r\n\r\nThen, there is the _After-guard_, stationed on the Quarterdeck; who,\r\nunder the Quarter-Masters and Quarter-Gunners, attend to the main-sail\r\nand spanker, and help haul the main-brace, and other ropes in the stern\r\nof the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe duties assigned to the After-Guard’s-Men being comparatively light\r\nand easy, and but little seamanship being expected from them, they are\r\ncomposed chiefly of landsmen; the least robust, least hardy, and least\r\nsailor-like of the crew; and being stationed on the Quarter-deck, they\r\nare generally selected with some eye to their personal appearance.\r\nHence, they are mostly slender young fellows, of a genteel figure and\r\ngentlemanly address; not weighing much on a rope, but weighing\r\nconsiderably in the estimation of all foreign ladies who may chance to\r\nvisit the ship. They lounge away the most part of their time, in\r\nreading novels and romances; talking over their lover affairs ashore;\r\nand comparing notes concerning the melancholy and sentimental career\r\nwhich drove them—poor young gentlemen—into the hard-hearted navy.\r\nIndeed, many of them show tokens of having moved in very respectable\r\nsociety. They always maintain a tidy exterior; and express an\r\nabhorrence of the tar-bucket, into which they are seldom or never\r\ncalled to dip their digits. And pluming themselves upon the cut of\r\ntheir trowsers, and the glossiness of their tarpaulins, from the rest\r\nof the ship’s company, they acquire the name of “_sea-dandies_” and\r\n“_silk-sock-gentry_.”\r\n\r\nThen, there are the _Waisters_, always stationed on the gun-deck. These\r\nhaul aft the fore and main-sheets, besides being subject to ignoble\r\nduties; attending to the drainage and sewerage below hatches. These\r\nfellows are all Jimmy Duxes—sorry chaps, who never put foot in ratlin,\r\nor venture above the bulwarks. Inveterate “_sons of farmers_,” with the\r\nhayseed yet in their hair, they are consigned to the congenial\r\nsuperintendence of the chicken-coops, pig-pens, and potato-lockers.\r\nThese are generally placed amidships, on the gun-deck of a frigate,\r\nbetween the fore and main hatches; and comprise so extensive an area,\r\nthat it much resembles the market place of a small town. The melodious\r\nsounds thence issuing, continually draw tears from the eyes of the\r\nWaisters; reminding them of their old paternal pig-pens and\r\npotato-patches. They are the tag-rag and bob-tail of the crew; and he\r\nwho is good for nothing else is good enough for a _Waister_.\r\n\r\nThree decks down—spar-deck, gun-deck, and berth-deck—and we come to a\r\nparcel of Troglodytes or “_holders_,” who burrow, like rabbits in\r\nwarrens, among the water-tanks, casks, and cables. Like Cornwall\r\nminers, wash off the soot from their skins, and they are all pale as\r\nghosts. Unless upon rare occasions, they seldom come on deck to sun\r\nthemselves. They may circumnavigate the world fifty times, and they see\r\nabout as much of it as Jonah did in the whale’s belly. They are a lazy,\r\nlumpish, torpid set; and when going ashore after a long cruise, come\r\nout into the day like terrapins from their caves, or bears in the\r\nspring, from tree-trunks. No one ever knows the names of these fellows;\r\nafter a three years’ voyage, they still remain strangers to you. In\r\ntime of tempests, when all hands are called to save ship, they issue\r\nforth into the gale, like the mysterious old men of Paris, during the\r\nmassacre of the Three Days of September: every one marvels who they\r\nare, and whence they come; they disappear as mysteriously; and are seen\r\nno more, until another general commotion.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal divisions into which a man-of-war’s crew is\r\ndivided; but the inferior allotments of duties are endless, and would\r\nrequire a German commentator to chronicle.\r\n\r\nWe say nothing here of Boatswain’s mates, Gunner’s mates, Carpenter’s\r\nmates, Sail-maker’s mates, Armorer’s mates, Master-at-Arms, Ship’s\r\ncorporals, Cockswains, Quarter-masters, Quarter-gunners, Captains of\r\nthe Forecastle, Captains of the Fore-top, Captains of the Main-top,\r\nCaptains of the Mizen-top, Captains of the After-Guard, Captains of the\r\nMain-Hold, Captains of the Fore-Hold, Captains of the Head, Coopers,\r\nPainters, Tinkers, Commodore’s Steward, Captain’s Steward, Ward-Room\r\nSteward, Steerage Steward, Commodore’s cook, Captain’s cook, Officers’\r\ncook, Cooks of the range, Mess-cooks, hammock-boys, messenger boys,\r\ncot-boys, loblolly-boys and numberless others, whose functions are\r\nfixed and peculiar.\r\n\r\nIt is from this endless subdivision of duties in a man-of-war, that,\r\nupon first entering one, a sailor has need of a good memory, and the\r\nmore of an arithmetician he is, the better.\r\n\r\nWhite-Jacket, for one, was a long time rapt in calculations, concerning\r\nthe various “numbers” allotted him by the _First Luff_, otherwise known\r\nas the First Lieutenant. In the first place, White-Jacket was given the\r\n_number of his mess_; then, his _ship’s number_, or the number to which\r\nhe must answer when the watch-roll is called; then, the number of his\r\nhammock; then, the number of the gun to which he was assigned; besides\r\na variety of other numbers; all of which would have taken Jedediah\r\nBuxton himself some time to arrange in battalions, previous to adding\r\nup. All these numbers, moreover, must be well remembered, or woe betide\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nConsider, now, a sailor altogether unused to the tumult of a\r\nman-of-war, for the first time stepping on board, and given all these\r\nnumbers to recollect. Already, before hearing them, his head is half\r\nstunned with the unaccustomed sounds ringing in his ears; which ears\r\nseem to him like belfries full of tocsins. On the gun-deck, a thousand\r\nscythed chariots seem passing; he hears the tread of armed marines; the\r\nclash of cutlasses and curses. The Boatswain’s mates whistle round him,\r\nlike hawks screaming in a gale, and the strange noises under decks are\r\nlike volcanic rumblings in a mountain. He dodges sudden sounds, as a\r\nraw recruit falling bombs.\r\n\r\nWell-nigh useless to him, now, all previous circumnavigations of this\r\nterraqueous globe; of no account his arctic, antarctic, or equinoctial\r\nexperiences; his gales off Beachy Head, or his dismastings off\r\nHatteras. He must begin anew; he knows nothing; Greek and Hebrew could\r\nnot help him, for the language he must learn has neither grammar nor\r\nlexicon.\r\n\r\nMark him, as he advances along the files of old ocean-warriors; mark\r\nhis debased attitude, his deprecating gestures, his Sawney stare, like\r\na Scotchman in London; his—“_cry your merry, noble seignors!_” He is\r\nwholly nonplussed, and confounded. And when, to crown all, the First\r\nLieutenant, whose business it is to welcome all new-corners, and assign\r\nthem their quarters: when this officer—none of the most bland or\r\namiable either—gives him number after number to\r\nrecollect—246—139—478—351—the poor fellow feels like decamping.\r\n\r\nStudy, then, your mathematics, and cultivate all your memories, oh ye!\r\nwho think of cruising in men-of-war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nJACK CHASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first night out of port was a clear, moonlight one; the frigate\r\ngliding though the water, with all her batteries.\r\n\r\nIt was my Quarter Watch in the top; and there I reclined on the best\r\npossible terms with my top-mates. Whatever the other seamen might have\r\nbeen, these were a noble set of tars, and well worthy an introduction\r\nto the reader.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost was Jack Chase, our noble First Captain of the Top.\r\nHe was a Briton, and a true-blue; tall and well-knit, with a clear open\r\neye, a fine broad brow, and an abounding nut-brown beard. No man ever\r\nhad a better heart or a bolder. He was loved by the seamen and admired\r\nby the officers; and even when the Captain spoke to him, it was with a\r\nslight air of respect. Jack was a frank and charming man.\r\n\r\nNo one could be better company in forecastle or saloon; no man told\r\nsuch stories, sang such songs, or with greater alacrity sprang to his\r\nduty. Indeed, there was only one thing wanting about him; and that was\r\na finger of his left hand, which finger he had lost at the great battle\r\nof Navarino.\r\n\r\nHe had a high conceit of his profession as a seaman; and being deeply\r\nversed in all things pertaining to a man-of-war, was universally\r\nregarded as an oracle. The main-top, over which he presided, was a sort\r\nof oracle of Delphi; to which many pilgrims ascended, to have their\r\nperplexities or differences settled.\r\n\r\nThere was such an abounding air of good sense and good feeling about\r\nthe man, that he who could not love him, would thereby pronounce\r\nhimself a knave. I thanked my sweet stars, that kind fortune had placed\r\nme near him, though under him, in the frigate; and from the outset Jack\r\nand I were fast friends.\r\n\r\nWherever you may be now rolling over the blue billows, dear Jack! take\r\nmy best love along with you; and God bless you, wherever you go!\r\n\r\nJack was a gentleman. What though his hand was hard, so was not his\r\nheart, too often the case with soft palms. His manners were easy and\r\nfree; none of the boisterousness, so common to tars; and he had a\r\npolite, courteous way of saluting you, if it were only to borrow your\r\nknife. Jack had read all the verses of Byron, and all the romances of\r\nScott. He talked of Rob Roy, Don Juan, and Pelham; Macbeth and Ulysses;\r\nbut, above all things, was an ardent admirer of Camoens. Parts of the\r\nLusiad, he could recite in the original. Where he had obtained his\r\nwonderful accomplishments, it is not for me, his humble subordinate, to\r\nsay. Enough, that those accomplishments were so various; the languages\r\nhe could converse in, so numerous; that he more than furnished an\r\nexample of that saying of Charles the Fifth—_ he who speaks five\r\nlanguages is as good as five men_. But Jack, he was better than a\r\nhundred common mortals; Jack was a whole phalanx, an entire army; Jack\r\nwas a thousand strong; Jack would have done honour to the Queen of\r\nEngland’s drawing-room; Jack must have been a by-blow of some British\r\nAdmiral of the Blue. A finer specimen of the island race of Englishmen\r\ncould not have been picked out of Westminster Abbey of a coronation\r\nday.\r\n\r\nHis whole demeanor was in strong contrast to that of one of the\r\nCaptains of the fore-top. This man, though a good seaman, furnished an\r\nexample of those insufferable Britons, who, while preferring other\r\ncountries to their own as places of residence; still, overflow with all\r\nthe pompousness of national and individual vanity combined. “When I was\r\non board the Audacious”—for a long time, was almost the invariable\r\nexordium to the fore-top Captain’s most cursory remarks. It is often\r\nthe custom of men-of-war’s-men, when they deem anything to be going on\r\nwrong aboard ship to refer to _last cruise_ when of course everything\r\nwas done _ship-shape and Bristol fashion_. And by referring to the\r\n_Audacious_—an expressive name by the way—the fore-top Captain meant a\r\nship in the English navy, in which he had had the honour of serving. So\r\ncontinual were his allusions to this craft with the amiable name, that\r\nat last, the _Audacious_ was voted a bore by his shipmates. And one hot\r\nafternoon, during a calm, when the fore-top Captain like many others,\r\nwas standing still and yawning on the spar-deck; Jack Chase, his own\r\ncountryman, came up to him, and pointing at his open mouth, politely\r\ninquired, whether that was the way they caught _flies_ in Her Britannic\r\nMajesty’s ship, the _Audacious?_ After that, we heard no more of the\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nNow, the tops of a frigate are quite spacious and cosy. They are railed\r\nin behind so as to form a kind of balcony, very pleasant of a tropical\r\nnight. From twenty to thirty loungers may agreeably recline there,\r\ncushioning themselves on old sails and jackets. We had rare times in\r\nthat top. We accounted ourselves the best seamen in the ship; and from\r\nour airy perch, literally looked down upon the landlopers below,\r\nsneaking about the deck, among the guns. In a large degree, we\r\nnourished that feeling of “_esprit de corps_,” always pervading, more\r\nor less, the various sections of a man-of-war’s crew. We main-top-men\r\nwere brothers, one and all, and we loaned ourselves to each other with\r\nall the freedom in the world.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I had not long been a member of this fraternity of fine\r\nfellows, ere I discovered that Jack Chase, our captain was—like all\r\nprime favorites and oracles among men—a little bit of a dictator; not\r\nperemptorily, or annoyingly so, but amusingly intent on egotistically\r\nmending our manners and improving our taste, so that we might reflect\r\ncredit upon our tutor.\r\n\r\nHe made us all wear our hats at a particular angle—instructed us in the\r\ntie of our neck-handkerchiefs; and protested against our wearing vulgar\r\n_dungeree_ trowsers; besides giving us lessons in seamanship; and\r\nsolemnly conjuring us, forever to eschew the company of any sailor we\r\nsuspected of having served in a whaler. Against all whalers, indeed, he\r\ncherished the unmitigated detestation of a true man-of-war’s man. Poor\r\nTubbs can testify to that.\r\n\r\nTubbs was in the After-Guard; a long, lank Vineyarder, eternally\r\ntalking of line-tubs, Nantucket, sperm oil, stove boats, and Japan.\r\nNothing could silence him; and his comparisons were ever invidious.\r\n\r\nNow, with all his soul, Jack abominated this Tubbs. He said he was\r\nvulgar, an upstart—Devil take him, he’s been in a whaler. But like many\r\nmen, who have been where _you_ haven’t been; or seen what _you_ haven’t\r\nseen; Tubbs, on account of his whaling experiences, absolutely affected\r\nto look down upon Jack, even as Jack did upon him; and this it was that\r\nso enraged our noble captain.\r\n\r\nOne night, with a peculiar meaning in his eye, he sent me down on deck\r\nto invite Tubbs up aloft for a chat. Flattered by so marked an\r\nhonor—for we were somewhat fastidious, and did not extend such\r\ninvitations to every body—Tubb’s quickly mounted the rigging, looking\r\nrather abashed at finding himself in the august presence of the\r\nassembled Quarter-Watch of main-top-men. Jack’s courteous manner,\r\nhowever, very soon relieved his embarrassment; but it is no use to be\r\ncourteous to _some_ men in this world. Tubbs belonged to that category.\r\nNo sooner did the bumpkin feel himself at ease, than he launched out,\r\nas usual, into tremendous laudations of whalemen; declaring that\r\nwhalemen alone deserved the name of sailors. Jack stood it some time;\r\nbut when Tubbs came down upon men-of-war, and particularly upon\r\nmain-top-men, his sense of propriety was so outraged, that he launched\r\ninto Tubbs like a forty-two pounder.\r\n\r\n“Why, you limb of Nantucket! you train-oil man! you sea-tallow\r\nstrainer! you bobber after carrion! do _you_ pretend to vilify a\r\nman-of-war? Why, you lean rogue, you, a man-of-war is to whalemen, as a\r\nmetropolis to shire-towns, and sequestered hamlets. _Here’s_ the place\r\nfor life and commotion; _here’s_ the place to be gentlemanly and jolly.\r\nAnd what did you know, you bumpkin! before you came on board this\r\n_Andrew Miller?_ What knew you of gun-deck, or orlop, mustering round\r\nthe capstan, beating to quarters, and piping to dinner? Did you ever\r\nroll to _grog_ on board your greasy ballyhoo of blazes? Did you ever\r\nwinter at Mahon? Did you ever ‘_lash and carry?_’ Why, what are even a\r\nmerchant-seaman’s sorry yarns of voyages to China after tea-caddies,\r\nand voyages to the West Indies after sugar puncheons, and voyages to\r\nthe Shetlands after seal-skins—what are even these yarns, you Tubbs\r\nyou! to high life in a man-of-war? Why, you dead-eye! I have sailed\r\nwith lords and marquises for captains; and the King of the Two Sicilies\r\nhas passed me, as I here stood up at my gun. Bah! you are full of the\r\nfore-peak and the forecastle; you are only familiar with Burtons and\r\nBilly-tackles; your ambition never mounted above pig-killing! which, in\r\nmy poor opinion, is the proper phrase for whaling! Topmates! has not\r\nthis Tubbs here been but a misuser of good oak planks, and a vile\r\ndesecrator of the thrice holy sea? turning his ship, my hearties! into\r\na fat-kettle, and the ocean into a whale-pen? Begone! you graceless,\r\ngodless knave! pitch him over the top there, White-Jacket!”\r\n\r\nBut there was no necessity for my exertions. Poor Tubbs, astounded at\r\nthese fulminations, was already rapidly descending by the rigging.\r\n\r\nThis outburst on the part of my noble friend Jack made me shake all\r\nover, spite of my padded surtout; and caused me to offer up devout\r\nthanksgivings, that in no evil hour had I divulged the fact of having\r\nmyself served in a whaler; for having previously marked the prevailing\r\nprejudice of men-of-war’s men to that much-maligned class of mariners,\r\nI had wisely held my peace concerning stove boats on the coast of\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nJACK CHASE ON A SPANISH QUARTER-DECK.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, I must frankly tell a story about Jack, which as touching his\r\nhonour and integrity, I am sure, will not work against him, in any\r\ncharitable man’s estimation. On this present cruise of the frigate\r\nNeversink, Jack had deserted; and after a certain interval, had been\r\ncaptured.\r\n\r\nBut with what purpose had he deserted? To avoid naval discipline? To\r\nriot in some abandoned sea-port? for love of some worthless signorita?\r\nNot at all. He abandoned the frigate from far higher and nobler, nay,\r\nglorious motives. Though bowing to naval discipline afloat; yet ashore,\r\nhe was a stickler for the Rights of Man, and the liberties of the\r\nworld. He went to draw a partisan blade in the civil commotions of\r\nPeru; and befriend, heart and soul, what he deemed the cause of the\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nAt the time, his disappearance excited the utmost astonishment among\r\nthe officers, who had little suspected him of any such conduct of\r\ndeserting.\r\n\r\n“What? Jack, my great man of the main-top, gone!” cried the captain;\r\n“I’ll not believe it.”\r\n\r\n“Jack Chase cut and run!” cried a sentimental middy. “It must have been\r\nall for love, then; the signoritas have turned his head.”\r\n\r\n“Jack Chase not to be found?” cried a growling old sheet-anchor-man,\r\none of your malicious prophets of past events: “I though so; I know’d\r\nit; I could have sworn it—just the chap to make sail on the sly. I\r\nalways s’pected him.”\r\n\r\nMonths passed away, and nothing was heard of Jack; till at last, the\r\nfrigate came to anchor on the coast, alongside of a Peruvian sloop of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nBravely clad in the Peruvian uniform, and with a fine, mixed martial\r\nand naval step, a tall, striking figure of a long-bearded officer was\r\ndescried, promenading the Quarter-deck of the stranger; and\r\nsuperintending the salutes, which are exchanged between national\r\nvessels on these occasions.\r\n\r\nThis fine officer touched his laced hat most courteously to our\r\nCaptain, who, after returning the compliment, stared at him, rather\r\nimpolitely, through his spy-glass.\r\n\r\n“By Heaven!” he cried at last—“it is he—he can’t disguise his\r\nwalk—that’s the beard; I’d know him in Cochin China.—Man the first\r\ncutter there! Lieutenant Blink, go on board that sloop of war, and\r\nfetch me yon officer.”\r\n\r\nAll hands were aghast—What? when a piping-hot peace was between the\r\nUnited States and Peru, to send an armed body on board a Peruvian sloop\r\nof war, and seize one of its officers, in broad daylight?—Monstrous\r\ninfraction of the Law of Nations! What would Vattel say?\r\n\r\nBut Captain Claret must be obeyed. So off went the cutter, every man\r\narmed to the teeth, the lieutenant-commanding having secret\r\ninstructions, and the midshipmen attending looking ominously wise,\r\nthough, in truth, they could not tell what was coming.\r\n\r\nGaining the sloop of war, the lieutenant was received with the\r\ncustomary honours; but by this time the tall, bearded officer had\r\ndisappeared from the Quarter-deck. The Lieutenant now inquired for the\r\nPeruvian Captain; and being shown into the cabin, made known to him,\r\nthat on board his vessel was a person belonging to the United States\r\nShip Neversink; and his orders were, to have that person delivered up\r\ninstanter.\r\n\r\nThe foreign captain curled his mustache in astonishment and\r\nindignation; he hinted something about beating to quarters, and\r\nchastising this piece of Yankee insolence.\r\n\r\nBut resting one gloved hand upon the table, and playing with his\r\nsword-knot, the Lieutenant, with a bland firmness, repeated his demand.\r\nAt last, the whole case being so plainly made out, and the person in\r\nquestion being so accurately described, even to a mole on his cheek,\r\nthere remained nothing but immediate compliance.\r\n\r\nSo the fine-looking, bearded officer, who had so courteously doffed his\r\nchapeau to our Captain, but disappeared upon the arrival of the\r\nLieutenant, was summoned into the cabin, before his superior, who\r\naddressed him thus:—\r\n\r\n“Don John, this gentleman declares, that of right you belong to the\r\nfrigate Neversink. Is it so?”\r\n\r\n“It is even so, Don Sereno,” said Jack Chase, proudly folding his\r\ngold-laced coat-sleeves across his chest—“and as there is no resisting\r\nthe frigate, I comply.—Lieutenant Blink, I am ready. Adieu! Don Sereno,\r\nand Madre de Dios protect you? You have been a most gentlemanly friend\r\nand captain to me. I hope you will yet thrash your beggarly foes.”\r\n\r\nWith that he turned; and entering the cutter, was pulled back to the\r\nfrigate, and stepped up to Captain Claret, where that gentleman stood\r\non the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\n“Your servant, my fine Don,” said the Captain, ironically lifting his\r\nchapeau, but regarding Jack at the same time with a look of intense\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n“Your most devoted and penitent Captain of the Main-top, sir; and one\r\nwho, in his very humility of contrition is yet proud to call Captain\r\nClaret his commander,” said Jack, making a glorious bow, and then\r\ntragically flinging overboard his Peruvian sword.\r\n\r\n“Reinstate him at once,” shouted Captain Claret—“and now, sir, to your\r\nduty; and discharge that well to the end of the cruise, and you will\r\nhear no more of your having run away.”\r\n\r\nSo Jack went forward among crowds of admiring tars, who swore by his\r\nnut-brown beard, which had amazingly lengthened and spread during his\r\nabsence. They divided his laced hat and coat among them; and on their\r\nshoulders, carried him in triumph along the gun-deck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\nTHE QUARTER-DECK OFFICERS, WARRANT OFFICERS, AND BERTH-DECK UNDERLINGS\r\nOF A MAN-OF-WAR; WHERE THEY LIVE IN THE SHIP; HOW THEY LIVE; THEIR\r\nSOCIAL STANDING ON SHIP-BOARD; AND WHAT SORT OF GENTLEMEN THEY ARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome account has been given of the various divisions into which our\r\ncrew was divided; so it may be well to say something of the officers;\r\nwho they are, and what are their functions.\r\n\r\nOur ship, be it know, was the flag-ship; that is, we sported a\r\n_broad-pennant_, or _bougee_, at the main, in token that we carried a\r\nCommodore—the highest rank of officers recognised in the American navy.\r\nThe bougee is not to be confounded with the _long pennant_ or\r\n_coach-whip_, a tapering serpentine streamer worn by all men-of-war.\r\n\r\nOwing to certain vague, republican scruples, about creating great\r\nofficers of the navy, America has thus far had no admirals; though, as\r\nher ships of war increase, they may become indispensable. This will\r\nassuredly be the case, should she ever have occasion to employ large\r\nfleets; when she must adopt something like the English plan, and\r\nintroduce three or four grades of flag-officers, above a\r\nCommodore—Admirals, Vice-Admirals, and Rear-Admirals of Squadrons;\r\ndistinguished by the color of their flags,—red, white, and blue,\r\ncorresponding to the centre, van, and rear. These rank respectively\r\nwith Generals, Lieutenant-Generals, and Major-Generals in the army;\r\njust as Commodore takes rank with a Brigadier-General. So that the same\r\nprejudice which prevents the American Government from creating Admirals\r\nshould have precluded the creation of all army officers above a\r\nBrigadier.\r\n\r\nAn American Commodore, like an English Commodore, or the French _Chef\r\nd’Escadre_, is but a senior Captain, temporarily commanding a small\r\nnumber of ships, detached for any special purpose. He has no permanent\r\nrank, recognised by Government, above his captaincy; though once\r\nemployed as a Commodore, usage and courtesy unite in continuing the\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\nOur Commodore was a gallant old man, who had seen service in his time.\r\nWhen a lieutenant, he served in the late war with England; and in the\r\ngun-boat actions on the Lakes near New Orleans, just previous to the\r\ngrand land engagements, received a musket-ball in his shoulder; which,\r\nwith the two balls in his eyes, he carries about with him to this day.\r\n\r\nOften, when I looked at the venerable old warrior, doubled up from the\r\neffect of his wound, I thought what a curious, as well as painful\r\nsensation, it must be, to have one’s shoulder a lead-mine; though,\r\nsooth to say, so many of us civilised mortals convert our mouths into\r\nGolcondas.\r\n\r\nOn account of this wound in his shoulder, our Commodore had a\r\nbody-servant’s pay allowed him, in addition to his regular salary. I\r\ncannot say a great deal, personally, of the Commodore; he never sought\r\nmy company at all, never extended any gentlemanly courtesies.\r\n\r\nBut though I cannot say much of him personally, I can mention something\r\nof him in his general character, as a flag-officer. In the first place,\r\nthen, I have serious doubts, whether for the most part, he was not\r\ndumb; for in my hearing, he seldom or never uttered a word. And not\r\nonly did he seem dumb himself, but his presence possessed the strange\r\npower of making other people dumb for the time. His appearance on the\r\nQuarter-deck seemed to give every officer the lock-jaw.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon about him was the strange manner in which everyone\r\nshunned him. At the first sign of those epaulets of his on the weather\r\nside of the poop, the officers there congregated invariably shrunk over\r\nto leeward, and left him alone. Perhaps he had an evil eye; may be he\r\nwas the Wandering Jew afloat. The real reason probably was, that like\r\nall high functionaries, he deemed it indispensable religiously to\r\nsustain his dignity; one of the most troublesome things in the world,\r\nand one calling for the greatest self-denial. And the constant watch,\r\nand many-sided guardedness, which this sustaining of a Commodore’s\r\ndignity requires, plainly enough shows that, apart from the common\r\ndignity of manhood, Commodores, in general possess no real dignity at\r\nall. True, it is expedient for crowned heads, generalissimos,\r\nLord-high-admirals, and Commodores, to carry themselves straight, and\r\nbeware of the spinal complaint; but it is not the less veritable, that\r\nit is a piece of assumption, exceedingly uncomfortable to themselves,\r\nand ridiculous to an enlightened generation.\r\n\r\nNow, how many rare good fellows there were among us main-top-men, who,\r\ninvited into his cabin over a social bottle or two, would have rejoiced\r\nour old Commodore’s heart, and caused that ancient wound of his to heal\r\nup at once.\r\n\r\nCome, come, Commodore don’t look so sour, old boy; step up aloft here\r\ninto the _top_, and we’ll spin you a sociable yarn.\r\n\r\nTruly, I thought myself much happier in that white jacket of mine, than\r\nour old Commodore in his dignified epaulets.\r\n\r\nOne thing, perhaps, that more than anything else helped to make our\r\nCommodore so melancholy and forlorn, was the fact of his having so\r\nlittle to do. For as the frigate had a captain; of course, so far as\r\n_she_ was concerned, our Commodore was a supernumerary. What abundance\r\nof leisure he must have had, during a three years’ cruise; how\r\nindefinitely he might have been improving his mind!\r\n\r\nBut as everyone knows that idleness is the hardest work in the world,\r\nso our Commodore was specially provided with a gentleman to assist him.\r\nThis gentleman was called the _Commodore’s secretary_. He was a\r\nremarkably urbane and polished man; with a very graceful exterior, and\r\nlooked much like an Ambassador Extraordinary from Versailles. He messed\r\nwith the Lieutenants in the Ward-room, where he had a state-room,\r\nelegantly furnished as the private cabinet of Pelham. His cot-boy used\r\nto entertain the sailors with all manner of stories about the\r\nsilver-keyed flutes and flageolets, fine oil paintings, morocco bound\r\nvolumes, Chinese chess-men, gold shirt-buttons, enamelled pencil cases,\r\nextraordinary fine French boots with soles no thicker than a sheet of\r\nscented note-paper, embroidered vests, incense-burning sealing-wax,\r\nalabaster statuettes of Venus and Adonis, tortoise-shell snuff-boxes,\r\ninlaid toilet-cases, ivory-handled hair-brushes and mother-of-pearl\r\ncombs, and a hundred other luxurious appendages scattered about this\r\nmagnificent secretary’s state-room.\r\n\r\nI was a long time in finding out what this secretary’s duties\r\ncomprised. But it seemed, he wrote the Commodore’s dispatches for\r\nWashington, and also was his general amanuensis. Nor was this a very\r\nlight duty, at times; for some commodores, though they do not _say_ a\r\ngreat deal on board ship, yet they have a vast deal to write. Very\r\noften, the regimental orderly, stationed at our Commodore’s cabin-door,\r\nwould touch his hat to the First Lieutenant, and with a mysterious air\r\nhand him a note. I always thought these notes must contain most\r\nimportant matters of state; until one day, seeing a slip of wet, torn\r\npaper in a scupper-hole, I read the following:\r\n\r\n“Sir, you will give the people pickles to-day with their fresh meat.\r\n\r\n    “To Lieutenant Bridewell.\r\n                 “By command of the Commodore;\r\n                            “Adolphus Dashman, Priv. Sec.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a new revelation; for, from his almost immutable reserve, I\r\nhad supposed that the Commodore never meddled immediately with the\r\nconcerns of the ship, but left all that to the captain. But the longer\r\nwe live, the more we learn of commodores.\r\n\r\nTurn we now to the second officer in rank, almost supreme, however, in\r\nthe internal affairs of his ship. Captain Claret was a large, portly\r\nman, a Harry the Eighth afloat, bluff and hearty; and as kingly in his\r\ncabin as Harry on his throne. For a ship is a bit of terra firma cut\r\noff from the main; it is a state in itself; and the captain is its\r\nking.\r\n\r\nIt is no limited monarchy, where the sturdy Commons have a right to\r\npetition, and snarl if they please; but almost a despotism like the\r\nGrand Turk’s. The captain’s word is law; he never speaks but in the\r\nimperative mood. When he stands on his Quarter-deck at sea, he\r\nabsolutely commands as far as eye can reach. Only the moon and stars\r\nare beyond his jurisdiction. He is lord and master of the sun.\r\n\r\nIt is not twelve o’clock till he says so. For when the sailing-master,\r\nwhose duty it is to take the regular observation at noon, touches his\r\nhat, and reports twelve o’clock to the officer of the deck; that\r\nfunctionary orders a midshipman to repair to the captain’s cabin, and\r\nhumbly inform him of the respectful suggestion of the sailing-master.\r\n\r\n“Twelve o’clock reported, sir,” says the middy.\r\n\r\n“_Make_ it so,” replies the captain.\r\n\r\nAnd the bell is struck eight by the messenger-boy, and twelve o’clock\r\nit is.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the Commodore, when the captain visits the deck, his\r\nsubordinate officers generally beat a retreat to the other side and, as\r\na general rule, would no more think of addressing him, except\r\nconcerning the ship, than a lackey would think of hailing the Czar of\r\nRussia on his throne, and inviting him to tea. Perhaps no mortal man\r\nhas more reason to feel such an intense sense of his own personal\r\nconsequence, as the captain of a man-of-war at sea.\r\n\r\nNext in rank comes the First or Senior Lieutenant, the chief executive\r\nofficer. I have no reason to love the particular gentleman who filled\r\nthat post aboard our frigate, for it was he who refused my petition for\r\nas much black paint as would render water-proof that white-jacket of\r\nmine. All my soakings and drenchings lie at his state-room door. I\r\nhardly think I shall ever forgive him; every twinge of the rheumatism,\r\nwhich I still occasionally feel, is directly referable to him. The\r\nImmortals have a reputation for clemency; and _they_ may pardon him;\r\nbut he must not dun me to be merciful. But my personal feelings toward\r\nthe man shall not prevent me from here doing him justice. In most\r\nthings he was an excellent seaman; prompt, loud, and to the point; and\r\nas such was well fitted for his station. The First Lieutenancy of a\r\nfrigate demands a good disciplinarian, and, every way, an energetic\r\nman. By the captain he is held responsible for everything; by that\r\nmagnate, indeed, he is supposed to be omnipresent; down in the hold,\r\nand up aloft, at one and the same time.\r\n\r\nHe presides at the head of the Ward-room officers’ table, who are so\r\ncalled from their messing together in a part of the ship thus\r\ndesignated. In a frigate it comprises the after part of the berth-deck.\r\nSometimes it goes by the name of the Gun-room, but oftener is called\r\nthe Ward-room. Within, this Ward-room much resembles a long, wide\r\ncorridor in a large hotel; numerous doors opening on both hands to the\r\nprivate apartments of the officers. I never had a good interior look at\r\nit but once; and then the Chaplain was seated at the table in the\r\ncentre, playing chess with the Lieutenant of Marines. It was mid-day,\r\nbut the place was lighted by lamps.\r\n\r\nBesides the First Lieutenant, the Ward-room officers include the junior\r\nlieutenants, in a frigate six or seven in number, the Sailing-master,\r\nPurser, Chaplain, Surgeon, Marine officers, and Midshipmen’s\r\nSchoolmaster, or “the Professor.” They generally form a very agreeable\r\nclub of good fellows; from their diversity of character, admirably\r\ncalculated to form an agreeable social whole. The Lieutenants discuss\r\nsea-fights, and tell anecdotes of Lord Nelson and Lady Hamilton; the\r\nMarine officers talk of storming fortresses, and the siege of\r\nGibraltar; the Purser steadies this wild conversation by occasional\r\nallusions to the rule of three; the Professor is always charged with a\r\nscholarly reflection, or an apt line from the classics, generally Ovid;\r\nthe Surgeon’s stories of the amputation-table judiciously serve to\r\nsuggest the mortality of the whole party as men; while the good\r\nchaplain stands ready at all times to give them pious counsel and\r\nconsolation.\r\n\r\nOf course these gentlemen all associate on a footing of perfect social\r\nequality.\r\n\r\nNext in order come the Warrant or Forward officers, consisting of the\r\nBoatswain, Gunner, Carpenter, and Sailmaker. Though these worthies\r\nsport long coats and wear the anchor-button; yet, in the estimation of\r\nthe Ward-room officers, they are not, technically speaking, rated\r\ngentlemen. The First Lieutenant, Chaplain, or Surgeon, for example,\r\nwould never dream of inviting them to dinner, In sea parlance, “they\r\ncome in at the hawse holes;” they have hard hands; and the carpenter\r\nand sail-maker practically understand the duties which they are called\r\nupon to superintend. They mess by themselves. Invariably four in\r\nnumber, they never have need to play whist with a dummy.\r\n\r\nIn this part of the category now come the “reefers,” otherwise\r\n“middies” or midshipmen. These boys are sent to sea, for the purpose of\r\nmaking commodores; and in order to become commodores, many of them deem\r\nit indispensable forthwith to commence chewing tobacco, drinking brandy\r\nand water, and swearing at the sailors. As they are only placed on\r\nboard a sea-going ship to go to school and learn the duty of a\r\nLieutenant; and until qualified to act as such, have few or no special\r\nfunctions to attend to; they are little more, while midshipmen, than\r\nsupernumeraries on board. Hence, in a crowded frigate, they are so\r\neverlastingly crossing the path of both men and officers, that in the\r\nnavy it has become a proverb, that a useless fellow is “_as much in the\r\nway as a reefer_.”\r\n\r\nIn a gale of wind, when all hands are called and the deck swarms with\r\nmen, the little “middies” running about distracted and having nothing\r\nparticular to do, make it up in vociferous swearing; exploding all\r\nabout under foot like torpedoes. Some of them are terrible little boys,\r\ncocking their cups at alarming angles, and looking fierce as young\r\nroosters. They are generally great consumers of Macassar oil and the\r\nBalm of Columbia; they thirst and rage after whiskers; and sometimes,\r\napplying their ointments, lay themselves out in the sun, to promote the\r\nfertility of their chins.\r\n\r\nAs the only way to learn to command, is to learn to obey, the usage of\r\na ship of war is such that the midshipmen are constantly being ordered\r\nabout by the Lieutenants; though, without having assigned them their\r\nparticular destinations, they are always going somewhere, and never\r\narriving. In some things, they almost have a harder time of it than the\r\nseamen themselves. They are messengers and errand-boys to their\r\nsuperiors.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Pert,” cries an officer of the deck, hailing a young gentleman\r\nforward. Mr. Pert advances, touches his hat, and remains in an attitude\r\nof deferential suspense. “Go and tell the boatswain I want him.” And\r\nwith this perilous errand, the middy hurries away, looking proud as a\r\nking.\r\n\r\nThe middies live by themselves in the steerage, where, nowadays, they\r\ndine off a table, spread with a cloth. They have a castor at dinner;\r\nthey have some other little boys (selected from the ship’s company) to\r\nwait upon them; they sometimes drink coffee out of china. But for all\r\nthese, their modern refinements, in some instances the affairs of their\r\nclub go sadly to rack and ruin. The china is broken; the japanned\r\ncoffee-pot dented like a pewter mug in an ale-house; the pronged forks\r\nresemble tooth-picks (for which they are sometimes used); the\r\ntable-knives are hacked into hand-saws; and the cloth goes to the\r\nsail-maker to be patched. Indeed, they are something like collegiate\r\nfreshmen and sophomores, living in the college buildings, especially so\r\nfar as the noise they make in their quarters is concerned. The steerage\r\nbuzzes, hums, and swarms like a hive; or like an infant-school of a hot\r\nday, when the school-mistress falls asleep with a fly on her nose.\r\n\r\nIn frigates, the ward-room—the retreat of the Lieutenants—immediately\r\nadjoining the steerage, is on the same deck with it. Frequently, when\r\nthe middies, waking early of a morning, as most youngsters do, would be\r\nkicking up their heels in their hammocks, or running about with\r\ndouble-reefed night-gowns, playing tag among the “clews;” the Senior\r\nlieutenant would burst among them with a—“Young gentlemen, I am\r\nastonished. You must stop this sky-larking. Mr. Pert, what are you\r\ndoing at the table there, without your pantaloons? To your hammock,\r\nsir. Let me see no more of this. If you disturb the ward-room again,\r\nyoung gentleman, you shall hear of it.” And so saying, this\r\nhoary-headed Senior Lieutenant would retire to his cot in his\r\nstate-room, like the father of a numerous family after getting up in\r\nhis dressing-gown and slippers, to quiet a daybreak tumult in his\r\npopulous nursery.\r\n\r\nHaving now descended from Commodore to Middy, we come lastly to a set\r\nof nondescripts, forming also a “mess” by themselves, apart from the\r\nseamen. Into this mess, the usage of a man-of-war thrusts various\r\nsubordinates—including the master-at-arms, purser’s steward, ship’s\r\ncorporals, marine sergeants, and ship’s yeomen, forming the first\r\naristocracy above the sailors.\r\n\r\nThe master-at-arms is a sort of high constable and school-master,\r\nwearing citizen’s clothes, and known by his official rattan. He it is\r\nwhom all sailors hate. His is the universal duty of a universal\r\ninformer and hunter-up of delinquents. On the berth-deck he reigns\r\nsupreme; spying out all grease-spots made by the various cooks of the\r\nseamen’s messes, and driving the laggards up the hatches, when all\r\nhands are called. It is indispensable that he should be a very Vidocq\r\nin vigilance. But as it is a heartless, so is it a thankless office. Of\r\ndark nights, most masters-of-arms keep themselves in readiness to dodge\r\nforty-two pound balls, dropped down the hatchways near them.\r\n\r\nThe ship’s corporals are this worthy’s deputies and ushers.\r\n\r\nThe marine sergeants are generally tall fellows with unyielding spines\r\nand stiff upper lips, and very exclusive in their tastes and\r\npredilections.\r\n\r\nThe ship’s yeoman is a gentleman who has a sort of counting-room in a\r\ntar-cellar down in the fore-hold. More will be said of him anon.\r\n\r\nExcept the officers above enumerated, there are none who mess apart\r\nfrom the seamen. The “_petty officers_,” so called; that is, the\r\nBoatswain’s, Gunner’s, Carpenter’s, and Sail-maker’s mates, the\r\nCaptains of the Tops, of the Forecastle, and of the After-Guard, and of\r\nthe Fore and Main holds, and the Quarter-Masters, all mess in common\r\nwith the crew, and in the American navy are only distinguished from the\r\ncommon seamen by their slightly additional pay. But in the English navy\r\nthey wear crowns and anchors worked on the sleeves of their jackets, by\r\nway of badges of office. In the French navy they are known by strips of\r\nworsted worn in the same place, like those designating the Sergeants\r\nand Corporals in the army.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen, that the dinner-table is the criterion of rank in\r\nour man-of-war world. The Commodore dines alone, because he is the only\r\nman of his rank in the ship. So too with the Captain; and the Ward-room\r\nofficers, warrant officers, midshipmen, the master-at-arms’ mess, and\r\nthe common seamen;—all of them, respectively, dine together, because\r\nthey are, respectively, on a footing of equality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nBREAKFAST, DINNER, AND SUPPER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only is the dinner-table a criterion of rank on board a man-of-war,\r\nbut also the dinner hour. He who dines latest is the greatest man; and\r\nhe who dines earliest is accounted the least. In a flag-ship, the\r\nCommodore generally dines about four or five o’clock; the Captain about\r\nthree; the Lieutenants about two; while _the people_ (by which phrase\r\nthe common seamen are specially designated in the nomenclature of the\r\nquarter-deck) sit down to their salt beef exactly at noon.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen, that while the two estates of sea-kings and\r\nsea-lords dine at rather patrician hours—and thereby, in the long run,\r\nimpair their digestive functions—the sea-commoners, or _the people_,\r\nkeep up their constitutions, by keeping up the good old-fashioned,\r\nElizabethan, Franklin-warranted dinner hour of twelve.\r\n\r\nTwelve o’clock! It is the natural centre, key-stone, and very heart of\r\nthe day. At that hour, the sun has arrived at the top of his hill; and\r\nas he seems to hang poised there a while, before coming down on the\r\nother side, it is but reasonable to suppose that he is then stopping to\r\ndine; setting an eminent example to all mankind. The rest of the day is\r\ncalled _afternoon_; the very sound of which fine old Saxon word conveys\r\na feeling of the lee bulwarks and a nap; a summer sea—soft breezes\r\ncreeping over it; dreamy dolphins gliding in the distance. _Afternoon!_\r\nthe word implies, that it is an after-piece, coming after the grand\r\ndrama of the day; something to be taken leisurely and lazily. But how\r\ncan this be, if you dine at five? For, after all, though Paradise Lost\r\nbe a noble poem, and we men-of-war’s men, no doubt, largely partake in\r\nthe immortality of the immortals yet, let us candidly confess it,\r\nshipmates, that, upon the whole, our dinners are the most momentous\r\nattains of these lives we lead beneath the moon. What were a day\r\nwithout a dinner? a dinnerless day! such a day had better be a night.\r\n\r\nAgain: twelve o’clock is the natural hour for us men-of-war’s men to\r\ndine, because at that hour the very time-pieces we have invented arrive\r\nat their terminus; they can get no further than twelve; when\r\nstraightway they continue their old rounds again. Doubtless, Adam and\r\nEve dined at twelve; and the Patriarch Abraham in the midst of his\r\ncattle; and old Job with his noon mowers and reapers, in that grand\r\nplantation of Uz; and old Noah himself, in the Ark, must have gone to\r\ndinner at precisely _eight bells_ (noon), with all his floating\r\nfamilies and farm-yards.\r\n\r\nBut though this antediluvian dinner hour is rejected by modern\r\nCommodores and Captains, it still lingers among “_the people_” under\r\ntheir command. Many sensible things banished from high life find an\r\nasylum among the mob.\r\n\r\nSome Commodores are very particular in seeing to it, that no man on\r\nboard the ship dare to dine after his (the Commodore’s,) own dessert is\r\ncleared away.—Not even the Captain. It is said, on good authority, that\r\na Captain once ventured to dine at five, when the Commodore’s hour was\r\nfour. Next day, as the story goes, that Captain received a private\r\nnote, and in consequence of that note, dined for the future at\r\nhalf-past three.\r\n\r\nThough in respect of the dinner hour on board a man-of-war, _the\r\npeople_ have no reason to complain; yet they have just cause, almost\r\nfor mutiny, in the outrageous hours assigned for their breakfast and\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nEight o’clock for breakfast; twelve for dinner; four for supper; and no\r\nmeals but these; no lunches and no cold snacks. Owing to this\r\narrangement (and partly to one watch going to their meals before the\r\nother, at sea), all the meals of the twenty-four hours are crowded into\r\na space of less than eight! Sixteen mortal hours elapse between supper\r\nand breakfast; including, to one watch, eight hours on deck! This is\r\nbarbarous; any physician will tell you so. Think of it! Before the\r\nCommodore has dined, you have supped. And in high latitudes, in\r\nsummer-time, you have taken your last meal for the day, and five hours,\r\nor more, daylight to spare!\r\n\r\nMr. Secretary of the Navy, in the name of _the people_, you should\r\ninterpose in this matter. Many a time have I, a maintop-man, found\r\nmyself actually faint of a tempestuous morning watch, when all my\r\nenergies were demanded—owing to this miserable, unphilosophical mode of\r\nallotting the government meals at sea. We beg you, Mr. Secretary, not\r\nto be swayed in this matter by the Honourable Board of Commodores, who\r\nwill no doubt tell you that eight, twelve, and four are the proper\r\nhours for _the people_ to take their Meals; inasmuch, as at these hours\r\nthe watches are relieved. For, though this arrangement makes a neater\r\nand cleaner thing of it for the officers, and looks very nice and\r\nsuperfine on paper; yet it is plainly detrimental to health; and in\r\ntime of war is attended with still more serious consequences to the\r\nwhole nation at large. If the necessary researches were made, it would\r\nperhaps be found that in those instances where men-of-war adopting the\r\nabove-mentioned hours for meals have encountered an enemy at night,\r\nthey have pretty generally been beaten; that is, in those cases where\r\nthe enemies’ meal times were reasonable; which is only to be accounted\r\nfor by the fact that _the people_ of the beaten vessels were fighting\r\non an empty stomach instead of a full one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nSELVAGEE CONTRASTED WITH MAD-JACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving glanced at the grand divisions of a man-of-war, let us now\r\ndescend to specialities: and, particularly, to two of the junior\r\nlieutenants; lords and noblemen; members of that House of Peers, the\r\ngun-room. There were several young lieutenants on board; but from these\r\ntwo—representing the extremes of character to be found in their\r\ndepartment—the nature of the other officers of their grade in the\r\nNeversink must be derived.\r\n\r\nOne of these two quarter-deck lords went among the sailors by a name of\r\ntheir own devising—Selvagee. Of course, it was intended to be\r\ncharacteristic; and even so it was.\r\n\r\nIn frigates, and all large ships of war, when getting under weigh, a\r\nlarge rope, called a _messenger_ used to carry the strain of the cable\r\nto the capstan; so that the anchor may be weighed, without the muddy,\r\nponderous cable, itself going round the capstan. As the cable enters\r\nthe hawse-hole, therefore, something must be constantly used, to keep\r\nthis travelling chain attached to this travelling _messenger_;\r\nsomething that may be rapidly wound round both, so as to bind them\r\ntogether. The article used is called a _selvagee_. And what could be\r\nbetter adapted to the purpose? It is a slender, tapering, unstranded\r\npiece of rope prepared with much solicitude; peculiarly flexible; and\r\nwreathes and serpentines round the cable and messenger like an\r\nelegantly-modeled garter-snake round the twisted stalks of a vine.\r\nIndeed, _Selvagee_ is the exact type and symbol of a tall, genteel,\r\nlimber, spiralising exquisite. So much for the derivation of the name\r\nwhich the sailors applied to the Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nFrom what sea-alcove, from what mermaid’s milliner’s shop, hast thou\r\nemerged, Selvagee! with that dainty waist and languid cheek? What\r\nheartless step-dame drove thee forth, to waste thy fragrance on the\r\nsalt sea-air?\r\n\r\nWas it _you_, Selvagee! that, outward-bound, off Cape Horn, looked at\r\nHermit Island through an opera-glass? Was it _you_, who thought of\r\nproposing to the Captain that, when the sails were furled in a gale, a\r\nfew drops of lavender should be dropped in their “bunts,” so that when\r\nthe canvas was set again, your nostrils might not be offended by its\r\nmusty smell? I do not _say_ it was you, Selvagee; I but deferentially\r\ninquire.\r\n\r\nIn plain prose, Selvagee was one of those officers whom the sight of a\r\ntrim-fitting naval coat had captivated in the days of his youth. He\r\nfancied, that if a _sea-officer_ dressed well, and conversed genteelly,\r\nhe would abundantly uphold the honour of his flag, and immortalise the\r\ntailor that made him. On that rock many young gentlemen split. For upon\r\na frigate’s quarter-deck, it is not enough to sport a coat fashioned by\r\na Stultz; it is not enough to be well braced with straps and\r\nsuspenders; it is not enough to have sweet reminiscences of Lauras and\r\nMatildas. It is a right down life of hard wear and tear, and the man\r\nwho is not, in a good degree, fitted to become a common sailor will\r\nnever make an officer. Take that to heart, all ye naval aspirants.\r\nThrust your arms up to the elbow in pitch and see how you like it, ere\r\nyou solicit a warrant. Prepare for white squalls, living gales and\r\ntyphoons; read accounts of shipwrecks and horrible disasters; peruse\r\nthe Narratives of Byron and Bligh; familiarise yourselves with the\r\nstory of the English frigate Alceste and the French frigate Medusa.\r\nThough you may go ashore, now and then, at Cadiz and Palermo; for every\r\nday so spent among oranges and ladies, you will have whole months of\r\nrains and gales.\r\n\r\nAnd even thus did Selvagee prove it. But with all the intrepid\r\neffeminacy of your true dandy, he still continued his Cologne-water\r\nbaths, and sported his lace-bordered handkerchiefs in the very teeth of\r\na tempest. Alas, Selvagee! there was no getting the lavender out of\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nBut Selvagee was no fool. Theoretically he understood his profession;\r\nbut the mere theory of seamanship forms but the thousandth part of what\r\nmakes a seaman. You cannot save a ship by working out a problem in the\r\ncabin; the deck is the field of action.\r\n\r\nWell aware of his deficiency in some things, Selvagee never took the\r\ntrumpet—which is the badge of the deck officer for the time—without a\r\ntremulous movement of the lip, and an earnest inquiring eye to the\r\nwindward. He encouraged those old Tritons, the Quarter-masters, to\r\ndiscourse with him concerning the likelihood of a squall; and often\r\nfollowed their advice as to taking in, or making sail. The smallest\r\nfavours in that way were thankfully received. Sometimes, when all the\r\nNorth looked unusually lowering, by many conversational blandishments,\r\nhe would endeavour to prolong his predecessor’s stay on deck, after\r\nthat officer’s watch had expired. But in fine, steady weather, when the\r\nCaptain would emerge from his cabin, Selvagee might be seen, pacing the\r\npoop with long, bold, indefatigable strides, and casting his eye up\r\naloft with the most ostentatious fidelity.\r\n\r\nBut vain these pretences; he could not deceive. Selvagee! you know very\r\nwell, that if it comes on to blow pretty hard, the First Lieutenant\r\nwill be sure to interfere with his paternal authority. Every man and\r\nevery boy in the frigate knows, Selvagee, that you are no Neptune.\r\n\r\nHow unenviable his situation! His brother officers do not insult him,\r\nto be sure; but sometimes their looks are as daggers. The sailors do\r\nnot laugh at him outright; but of dark nights they jeer, when they\r\nhearken to that mantuamaker’s voice ordering _a strong pull at the main\r\nbrace_, or _hands by the halyards!_ Sometimes, by way of being\r\nterrific, and making the men jump, Selvagee raps out an oath; but the\r\nsoft bomb stuffed with confectioner’s kisses seems to burst like a\r\ncrushed rose-bud diffusing its odours. Selvagee! Selvagee! take a\r\nmain-top-man’s advice; and this cruise over, never more tempt the sea.\r\n\r\nWith this gentleman of cravats and curling irons, how strongly\r\ncontrasts the man who was born in a gale! For in some time of\r\ntempest—off Cape Horn or Hatteras—_Mad Jack_ must have entered the\r\nworld—such things have been—not with a silver spoon, but with a\r\nspeaking-trumpet in his mouth; wrapped up in a caul, as in a\r\nmain-sail—for a charmed life against shipwrecks he bears—and crying,\r\n_Luff! luff, you may!—steady!—port! World ho!—here I am!_\r\n\r\nMad Jack is in his saddle on the sea. _That_ is his home; he would not\r\ncare much, if another Flood came and overflowed the dry land; for what\r\nwould it do but float his good ship higher and higher and carry his\r\nproud nation’s flag round the globe, over the very capitals of all\r\nhostile states! Then would masts surmount spires; and all mankind, like\r\nthe Chinese boatmen in Canton River, live in flotillas and fleets, and\r\nfind their food in the sea.\r\n\r\nMad Jack was expressly created and labelled for a tar. Five feet nine\r\nis his mark, in his socks; and not weighing over eleven stone before\r\ndinner. Like so many ship’s shrouds, his muscles and tendons are all\r\nset true, trim, and taut; he is braced up fore and aft, like a ship on\r\nthe wind. His broad chest is a bulkhead, that dams off the gale; and\r\nhis nose is an aquiline, that divides it in two, like a keel. His loud,\r\nlusty lungs are two belfries, full of all manner of chimes; but you\r\nonly hear his deepest bray, in the height of some tempest—like the\r\ngreat bell of St. Paul’s, which only sounds when the King or the Devil\r\nis dead.\r\n\r\nLook at him there, where he stands on the poop—one foot on the rail,\r\nand one hand on a shroud—his head thrown back, and his trumpet like an\r\nelephant’s trunk thrown up in the air. Is he going to shoot dead with\r\nsounds, those fellows on the main-topsail-yard?\r\n\r\nMad Jack was a bit of a tyrant—they _say_ all good officers are—but the\r\nsailors loved him all round; and would much rather stand fifty watches\r\nwith him, than one with a rose-water sailor.\r\n\r\nBut Mad Jack, alas! has one fearful failing. He drinks. And so do we\r\nall. But Mad Jack, _He_ only drinks brandy. The vice was inveterate;\r\nsurely, like Ferdinand, Count Fathom, he must have been suckled at a\r\npuncheon. Very often, this bad habit got him into very serious scrapes.\r\nTwice was he put off duty by the Commodore; and once he came near being\r\nbroken for his frolics. So far as his efficiency as a sea-officer was\r\nconcerned, on shore at least, Jack might _bouse away_ as much as he\r\npleased; but afloat it will not do at all.\r\n\r\nNow, if he only followed the wise example set by those ships of the\r\ndesert, the camels; and while in port, drank for the thirst past, the\r\nthirst present, and the thirst to come—so that he might cross the ocean\r\nsober; Mad Jack would get along pretty well. Still better, if he would\r\nbut eschew brandy altogether; and only drink of the limpid white-wine\r\nof the rills and the brooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nOF THE POCKETS THAT WERE IN THE JACKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nI MUST make some further mention of that white jacket of mine.\r\n\r\nAnd here be it known—by way of introduction to what is to follow—that\r\nto a common sailor, the living on board a man-of-war is like living in\r\na market; where you dress on the door-steps, and sleep in the cellar.\r\nNo privacy can you have; hardly one moment’s seclusion. It is almost a\r\nphysical impossibility, that you can ever be alone. You dine at a vast\r\n_table d’hote_; sleep in commons, and make your toilet where and when\r\nyou can. There is no calling for a mutton chop and a pint of claret by\r\nyourself; no selecting of chambers for the night; no hanging of\r\npantaloons over the back of a chair; no ringing your bell of a rainy\r\nmorning, to take your coffee in bed. It is something like life in a\r\nlarge manufactory. The bell strikes to dinner, and hungry or not, you\r\nmust dine.\r\n\r\nYour clothes are stowed in a large canvas bag, generally painted black,\r\nwhich you can get out of the “rack” only once in the twenty-four hours;\r\nand then, during a time of the utmost confusion; among five hundred\r\nother bags, with five hundred other sailors diving into each, in the\r\nmidst of the twilight of the berth-deck. In some measure to obviate\r\nthis inconvenience, many sailors divide their wardrobes between their\r\nhammocks and their bags; stowing a few frocks and trowsers in the\r\nformer; so that they can shift at night, if they wish, when the\r\nhammocks are piped down. But they gain very little by this.\r\n\r\nYou have no place whatever but your bag or hammock, in which to put\r\nanything in a man-of-war. If you lay anything down, and turn your back\r\nfor a moment, ten to one it is gone.\r\n\r\nNow, in sketching the preliminary plan, and laying out the foundation\r\nof that memorable white jacket of mine, I had had an earnest eye to all\r\nthese inconveniences, and re-solved to avoid them. I proposed, that not\r\nonly should my jacket keep me warm, but that it should also be so\r\nconstructed as to contain a shirt or two, a pair of trowsers, and\r\ndivers knick-knacks—sewing utensils, books, biscuits, and the like.\r\nWith this object, I had accordingly provided it with a great variety of\r\npockets, pantries, clothes-presses, and cupboards.\r\n\r\nThe principal apartments, two in number, were placed in the skirts,\r\nwith a wide, hospitable entrance from the inside; two more, of smaller\r\ncapacity, were planted in each breast, with folding-doors\r\ncommunicating, so that in case of emergency, to accommodate any bulky\r\narticles, the two pockets in each breast could be thrown into one.\r\nThere were, also, several unseen recesses behind the arras; insomuch,\r\nthat my jacket, like an old castle, was full of winding stairs, and\r\nmysterious closets, crypts, and cabinets; and like a confidential\r\nwriting-desk, abounded in snug little out-of-the-way lairs and\r\nhiding-places, for the storage of valuables.\r\n\r\nSuperadded to these, were four capacious pockets on the outside; one\r\npair to slip books into when suddenly startled from my studies to the\r\nmain-royal-yard; and the other pair, for permanent mittens, to thrust\r\nmy hands into of a cold night-watch. This last contrivance was regarded\r\nas needless by one of my top-mates, who showed me a pattern for\r\nsea-mittens, which he said was much better than mine.\r\n\r\nIt must be known, that sailors, even in the bleakest weather, only\r\ncover their hands when unemployed; they never wear mittens aloft, since\r\naloft they literally carry their lives in their hands, and want nothing\r\nbetween their grasp of the hemp, and the hemp itself.—Therefore, it is\r\ndesirable, that whatever things they cover their hands with, should be\r\ncapable of being slipped on and off in a moment. Nay, it is desirable,\r\nthat they should be of such a nature, that in a dark night, when you\r\nare in a great hurry—say, going to the helm—they may be jumped into,\r\nindiscriminately; and not be like a pair of right-and-left kids;\r\nneither of which will admit any hand, but the particular one meant for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMy top-mate’s contrivance was this—he ought to have got out a patent\r\nfor it—each of his mittens was provided with two thumbs, one on each\r\nside; the convenience of which needs no comment. But though for clumsy\r\nseamen, whose fingers are all thumbs, this description of mitten might\r\ndo very well, White-Jacket did not so much fancy it. For when your hand\r\nwas once in the bag of the mitten, the empty thumb-hole sometimes\r\ndangled at your palm, confounding your ideas of where your real thumb\r\nmight be; or else, being carefully grasped in the hand, was continually\r\nsuggesting the insane notion, that you were all the while having hold\r\nof some one else’s thumb.\r\n\r\nNo; I told my good top-mate to go away with his four thumbs, I would\r\nhave nothing to do with them; two thumbs were enough for any man.\r\n\r\nFor some time after completing my jacket, and getting the furniture and\r\nhousehold stores in it; I thought that nothing could exceed it for\r\nconvenience. Seldom now did I have occasion to go to my bag, and be\r\njostled by the crowd who were making their wardrobe in a heap. If I\r\nwanted anything in the way of clothing, thread, needles, or literature,\r\nthe chances were that my invaluable jacket contained it. Yes: I fairly\r\nhugged myself, and revelled in my jacket; till, alas! a long rain put\r\nme out of conceit of it. I, and all my pockets and their contents, were\r\nsoaked through and through, and my pocket-edition of Shakespeare was\r\nreduced to an omelet.\r\n\r\nHowever, availing myself of a fine sunny day that followed, I emptied\r\nmyself out in the main-top, and spread all my goods and chattels to\r\ndry. But spite of the bright sun, that day proved a black one. The\r\nscoundrels on deck detected me in the act of discharging my saturated\r\ncargo; they now knew that the white jacket was used for a storehouse.\r\nThe consequence was that, my goods being well dried and again stored\r\naway in my pockets, the very next night, when it was my quarter-watch\r\non deck, and not in the top (where they were all honest men), I noticed\r\na parcel of fellows skulking about after me, wherever I went. To a man,\r\nthey were pickpockets, and bent upon pillaging me. In vain I kept\r\nclapping my pocket like a nervous old gentlemen in a crowd; that same\r\nnight I found myself minus several valuable articles. So, in the end, I\r\nmasoned up my lockers and pantries; and save the two used for mittens,\r\nthe white jacket ever after was pocketless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nFROM POCKETS TO PICKPOCKETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the latter part of the preceding chapter may seem strange to those\r\nlandsmen, who have been habituated to indulge in high-raised, romantic\r\nnotions of the man-of-war’s man’s character; it may not be amiss, to\r\nset down here certain facts on this head, which may serve to place the\r\nthing in its true light.\r\n\r\nFrom the wild life they lead, and various other causes (needless to\r\nmention), sailors, as a class, entertain the most liberal notions\r\nconcerning morality and the Decalogue; or rather, they take their own\r\nviews of such matters, caring little for the theological or ethical\r\ndefinitions of others concerning what may be criminal, or wrong.\r\n\r\nTheir ideas are much swayed by circumstances. They will covertly\r\nabstract a thing from one, whom they dislike; and insist upon it, that,\r\nin such a case, stealing is not robbing. Or, where the theft involves\r\nsomething funny, as in the case of the white jacket, they only steal\r\nfor the sake of the joke; but this much is to be observed nevertheless,\r\ni. e., that they never spoil the joke by returning the stolen article.\r\n\r\nIt is a good joke; for instance, and one often perpetrated on board\r\nship, to stand talking to a man in a dark night watch, and all the\r\nwhile be cutting the buttons from his coat. But once off, those buttons\r\nnever grow on again. There is no spontaneous vegetation in buttons.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is a thing unavoidable, but the truth is that, among the\r\ncrew of a man-of-war, scores of desperadoes are too often found, who\r\nstop not at the largest enormities. A species of highway robbery is not\r\nunknown to them. A _gang_ will be informed that such a fellow has three\r\nor four gold pieces in the money-bag, so-called, or purse, which many\r\ntars wear round their necks, tucked out of sight. Upon this, they\r\ndeliberately lay their plans; and in due time, proceed to carry them\r\ninto execution. The man they have marked is perhaps strolling along the\r\nbenighted berth-deck to his mess-chest; when of a sudden, the foot-pads\r\ndash out from their hiding-place, throw him down, and while two or\r\nthree gag him, and hold him fast, another cuts the bag from his neck,\r\nand makes away with it, followed by his comrades. This was more than\r\nonce done in the Neversink.\r\n\r\nAt other times, hearing that a sailor has something valuable secreted\r\nin his hammock, they will rip it open from underneath while he sleeps,\r\nand reduce the conjecture to a certainty.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate all the minor pilferings on board a man-of-war would be\r\nendless. With some highly commendable exceptions, they rob from one\r\nanother, and rob back again, till, in the matter of small things, a\r\ncommunity of goods seems almost established; and at last, as a whole,\r\nthey become relatively honest, by nearly every man becoming the\r\nreverse. It is in vain that the officers, by threats of condign\r\npunishment, endeavour to instil more virtuous principles into their\r\ncrew; so thick is the mob, that not one thief in a thousand is\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE PURSUIT OF POETRY UNDER DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feeling of insecurity concerning one’s possessions in the\r\nNeversink, which the things just narrated begat in the minds of honest\r\nmen, was curiously exemplified in the case of my poor friend Lemsford,\r\na gentlemanly young member of the After-Guard. I had very early made\r\nthe acquaintance of Lemsford. It is curious, how unerringly a man\r\npitches upon a spirit, any way akin to his own, even in the most\r\nmiscellaneous mob.\r\n\r\nLemsford was a poet; so thoroughly inspired with the divine afflatus,\r\nthat not even all the tar and tumult of a man-of-war could drive it out\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nAs may readily be imagined, the business of writing verse is a very\r\ndifferent thing on the gun-deck of a frigate, from what the gentle and\r\nsequestered Wordsworth found it at placid Rydal Mount in Westmoreland.\r\nIn a frigate, you cannot sit down and meander off your sonnets, when\r\nthe full heart prompts; but only, when more important duties permit:\r\nsuch as bracing round the yards, or reefing top-sails fore and aft.\r\nNevertheless, every fragment of time at his command was religiously\r\ndevoted by Lemsford to the Nine. At the most unseasonable hours, you\r\nwould behold him, seated apart, in some corner among the guns—a\r\nshot-box before him, pen in hand, and eyes “_in a fine frenzy\r\nrolling_.”\r\n\r\n“What’s that ’ere born nat’ral about?”—“He’s got a fit, hain’t he?”\r\nwere exclamations often made by the less learned of his shipmates. Some\r\ndeemed him a conjurer; others a lunatic; and the knowing ones said,\r\nthat he must be a crazy Methodist. But well knowing by experience the\r\ntruth of the saying, that _poetry is its own exceeding great reward_,\r\nLemsford wrote on; dashing off whole epics, sonnets, ballads, and\r\nacrostics, with a facility which, under the circumstances, amazed me.\r\nOften he read over his effusions to me; and well worth the hearing they\r\nwere. He had wit, imagination, feeling, and humour in abundance; and\r\nout of the very ridicule with which some persons regarded him, he made\r\nrare metrical sport, which we two together enjoyed by ourselves; or\r\nshared with certain select friends.\r\n\r\nStill, the taunts and jeers so often levelled at my friend the poet,\r\nwould now and then rouse him into rage; and at such times the haughty\r\nscorn he would hurl on his foes, was proof positive of his possession\r\nof that one attribute, irritability, almost universally ascribed to the\r\nvotaries of Parnassus and the Nine.\r\n\r\nMy noble captain, Jack Chase, rather patronised Lemsford, and he would\r\nstoutly take his part against scores of adversaries. Frequently,\r\ninviting him up aloft into his top, he would beg him to recite some of\r\nhis verses; to which he would pay the most heedful attention, like\r\nMaecenas listening to Virgil, with a book of Aeneid in his hand. Taking\r\nthe liberty of a well-wisher, he would sometimes gently criticise the\r\npiece, suggesting a few immaterial alterations. And upon my word, noble\r\nJack, with his native-born good sense, taste, and humanity, was not ill\r\nqualified to play the true part of a _Quarterly Review_;—which is, to\r\ngive quarter at last, however severe the critique.\r\n\r\nNow Lemsford’s great care, anxiety, and endless source of tribulation\r\nwas the preservation of his manuscripts. He had a little box, about the\r\nsize of a small dressing-case, and secured with a lock, in which he\r\nkept his papers and stationery. This box, of course, he could not keep\r\nin his bag or hammock, for, in either case, he would only be able to\r\nget at it once in the twenty-four hours. It was necessary to have it\r\naccessible at all times. So when not using it, he was obliged to hide\r\nit out of sight, where he could. And of all places in the world, a ship\r\nof war, above her _hold_, least abounds in secret nooks. Almost every\r\ninch is occupied; almost every inch is in plain sight; and almost every\r\ninch is continually being visited and explored. Added to all this, was\r\nthe deadly hostility of the whole tribe of\r\nship-underlings—master-at-arms, ship’s corporals, and boatswain’s\r\nmates,—both to the poet and his casket. They hated his box, as if it\r\nhad been Pandora’s, crammed to the very lid with hurricanes and gales.\r\nThey hunted out his hiding-places like pointers, and gave him no peace\r\nnight or day.\r\n\r\nStill, the long twenty-four-pounders on the main-deck offered some\r\npromise of a hiding-place to the box; and, accordingly, it was often\r\ntucked away behind the carriages, among the side tackles; its black\r\ncolour blending with the ebon hue of the guns.\r\n\r\nBut Quoin, one of the quarter-gunners, had eyes like a ferret. Quoin\r\nwas a little old man-of-war’s man, hardly five feet high, with a\r\ncomplexion like a gun-shot wound after it is healed. He was\r\nindefatigable in attending to his duties; which consisted in taking\r\ncare of one division of the guns, embracing ten of the aforesaid\r\ntwenty-four-pounders. Ranged up against the ship’s side at regular\r\nintervals, they resembled not a little a stud of sable chargers in\r\ntheir stall. Among this iron stud little Quoin was continually running\r\nin and out, currying them down, now and then, with an old rag, or\r\nkeeping the flies off with a brush. To Quoin, the honour and dignity of\r\nthe United States of America seemed indissolubly linked with the\r\nkeeping his guns unspotted and glossy. He himself was black as a\r\nchimney-sweep with continually tending them, and rubbing them down with\r\nblack paint. He would sometimes get outside of the port-holes and peer\r\ninto their muzzles, as a monkey into a bottle. Or, like a dentist, he\r\nseemed intent upon examining their teeth. Quite as often, he would be\r\nbrushing out their touch-holes with a little wisp of oakum, like a\r\nChinese barber in Canton, cleaning a patient’s ear.\r\n\r\nSuch was his solicitude, that it was a thousand pities he was not able\r\nto dwarf himself still more, so as to creep in at the touch-hole, and\r\nexamining the whole interior of the tube, emerge at last from the\r\nmuzzle. Quoin swore by his guns, and slept by their side. Woe betide\r\nthe man whom he found leaning against them, or in any way soiling them.\r\nHe seemed seized with the crazy fancy, that his darling\r\ntwenty-four-pounders were fragile, and might break, like glass retorts.\r\n\r\nNow, from this Quoin’s vigilance, how could my poor friend the poet\r\nhope to escape with his box? Twenty times a week it was pounced upon,\r\nwith a “here’s that d——d pillbox again!” and a loud threat, to pitch it\r\noverboard the next time, without a moment’s warning, or benefit of\r\nclergy. Like many poets, Lemsford was nervous, and upon these occasions\r\nhe trembled like a leaf. Once, with an inconsolable countenance, he\r\ncame to me, saying that his casket was nowhere to be found; he had\r\nsought for it in his hiding-place, and it was not there.\r\n\r\nI asked him where he had hidden it?\r\n\r\n“Among the guns,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“Then depend upon it, Lemsford, that Quoin has been the death of it.”\r\n\r\nStraight to Quoin went the poet. But Quoin knew nothing about it. For\r\nten mortal days the poet was not to be comforted; dividing his leisure\r\ntime between cursing Quoin and lamenting his loss. The world is undone,\r\nhe must have thought: no such calamity has befallen it since the\r\nDeluge;—my verses are perished.\r\n\r\nBut though Quoin, as it afterward turned out, had indeed found the box,\r\nit so happened that he had not destroyed it; which no doubt led\r\nLemsford to infer that a superintending Providence had interposed to\r\npreserve to posterity his invaluable casket. It was found at last,\r\nlying exposed near the galley.\r\n\r\nLemsford was not the only literary man on board the Neversink. There\r\nwere three or four persons who kept journals of the cruise. One of\r\nthese journalists embellished his work—which was written in a large\r\nblank account-book—with various coloured illustrations of the harbours\r\nand bays at which the frigate had touched; and also, with small crayon\r\nsketches of comical incidents on board the frigate itself. He would\r\nfrequently read passages of his book to an admiring circle of the more\r\nrefined sailors, between the guns. They pronounced the whole\r\nperformance a miracle of art. As the author declared to them that it\r\nwas all to be printed and published so soon as the vessel reached home,\r\nthey vied with each other in procuring interesting items, to be\r\nincorporated into additional chapters. But it having been rumoured\r\nabroad that this journal was to be ominously entitled “_The Cruise of\r\nthe Neversink, or a Paixhan shot into Naval Abuses;_” and it having\r\nalso reached the ears of the Ward-room that the work contained\r\nreflections somewhat derogatory to the dignity of the officers, the\r\nvolume was seized by the master-at-arms, armed with a warrant from the\r\nCaptain. A few days after, a large nail was driven straight through the\r\ntwo covers, and clinched on the other side, and, thus everlastingly\r\nsealed, the book was committed to the deep. The ground taken by the\r\nauthorities on this occasion was, perhaps, that the book was obnoxious\r\nto a certain clause in the Articles of War, forbidding any person in\r\nthe Navy to bring any other person in the Navy into contempt, which the\r\nsuppressed volume undoubtedly did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\nTHE GOOD OR BAD TEMPER OF MEN-OF-WAR’S MEN, IN A GREAT DEGREE,\r\nATTRIBUTABLE TO THEIR PARTICULAR STATIONS AND DUTIES ABOARD SHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuoin, the quarter-gunner, was the representative of a class on board\r\nthe Neversink, altogether too remarkable to be left astern, without\r\nfurther notice, in the rapid wake of these chapters.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, Quoin was full of unaccountable whimsies; he was,\r\nwithal, a very cross, bitter, ill-natured, inflammable old man. So,\r\ntoo, were all the members of the gunner’s gang; including the two\r\ngunner’s mates, and all the quarter-gunners. Every one of them had the\r\nsame dark brown complexion; all their faces looked like smoked hams.\r\nThey were continually grumbling and growling about the batteries;\r\nrunning in and out among the guns; driving the sailors away from them;\r\nand cursing and swearing as if all their conscience had been\r\npowder-singed, and made callous, by their calling. Indeed they were a\r\nmost unpleasant set of men; especially Priming, the nasal-voiced\r\ngunner’s mate, with the hare-lip; and Cylinder, his stuttering\r\ncoadjutor, with the clubbed foot. But you will always observe, that the\r\ngunner’s gang of every man-of-war are invariably ill-tempered, ugly\r\nfeatured, and quarrelsome. Once when I visited an English\r\nline-of-battle ship, the gunner’s gang were fore and aft, polishing up\r\nthe batteries, which, according to the Admiral’s fancy, had been\r\npainted white as snow. Fidgeting round the great thirty-two-pounders,\r\nand making stinging remarks at the sailors and each other, they\r\nreminded one of a swarm of black wasps, buzzing about rows of white\r\nheadstones in a church-yard.\r\n\r\nNow, there can be little doubt, that their being so much among the guns\r\nis the very thing that makes a gunner’s gang so cross and quarrelsome.\r\nIndeed, this was once proved to the satisfaction of our whole company\r\nof main-top-men. A fine top-mate of ours, a most merry and\r\ncompanionable fellow, chanced to be promoted to a quarter-gunner’s\r\nberth. A few days afterward, some of us main-top-men, his old comrades,\r\nwent to pay him a visit, while he was going his regular rounds through\r\nthe division of guns allotted to his care. But instead of greeting us\r\nwith his usual heartiness, and cracking his pleasant jokes, to our\r\namazement, he did little else but scowl; and at last, when we rallied\r\nhim upon his ill-temper, he seized a long black rammer from overhead,\r\nand drove us on deck; threatening to report us, if we ever dared to be\r\nfamiliar with him again.\r\n\r\nMy top-mates thought that this remarkable metamorphose was the effect\r\nproduced upon a weak, vain character suddenly elevated from the level\r\nof a mere seaman to the dignified position of a _petty officer_. But\r\nthough, in similar cases, I had seen such effects produced upon some of\r\nthe crew; yet, in the present instance, I knew better than that;—it was\r\nsolely brought about by his consorting with with those villainous,\r\nirritable, ill-tempered cannon; more especially from his being subject\r\nto the orders of those deformed blunderbusses, Priming and Cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be, indeed, that all people should be very careful\r\nin selecting their callings and vocations; very careful in seeing to\r\nit, that they surround themselves by good-humoured, pleasant-looking\r\nobjects; and agreeable, temper-soothing sounds. Many an angelic\r\ndisposition has had its even edge turned, and hacked like a saw; and\r\nmany a sweet draught of piety has soured on the heart from people’s\r\nchoosing ill-natured employments, and omitting to gather round them\r\ngood-natured landscapes. Gardeners are almost always pleasant, affable\r\npeople to converse with; but beware of quarter-gunners, keepers of\r\narsenals, and lonely light-house men.\r\n\r\nIt would be advisable for any man, who from an unlucky choice of a\r\nprofession, which it is too late to change for another, should find his\r\ntemper souring, to endeavour to counteract that misfortune, by filling\r\nhis private chamber with amiable, pleasurable sights and sounds. In\r\nsummer time, an Aeolian harp can be placed in your window at a very\r\ntrifling expense; a conch-shell might stand on your mantel, to be taken\r\nup and held to the ear, that you may be soothed by its continual\r\nlulling sound, when you feel the blue fit stealing over you. For\r\nsights, a gay-painted punch-bowl, or Dutch tankard—never mind about\r\nfilling it—might be recommended. It should be placed on a bracket in\r\nthe pier. Nor is an old-fashioned silver ladle, nor a chased\r\ndinner-castor, nor a fine portly demijohn, nor anything, indeed, that\r\nsavors of eating and drinking, bad to drive off the spleen. But perhaps\r\nthe best of all is a shelf of merrily-bound books, containing comedies,\r\nfarces, songs, and humorous novels. You need never open them; only have\r\nthe titles in plain sight. For this purpose, Peregrine Pickle is a good\r\nbook; so is Gil Blas; so is Goldsmith.\r\n\r\nBut of all chamber furniture in the world, best calculated to cure a\r\nhad temper, and breed a pleasant one, is the sight of a lovely wife. If\r\nyou have children, however, that are teething, the nursery should be a\r\ngood way up stairs; at sea, it ought to be in the mizzen-top. Indeed,\r\nteething children play the very deuce with a husband’s temper. I have\r\nknown three promising young husbands completely spoil on their wives’\r\nhands, by reason of a teething child, whose worrisomeness happened to\r\nbe aggravated at the time by the summer-complaint. With a breaking\r\nheart, and my handkerchief to my eyes, I followed those three hapless\r\nyoung husbands, one after the other, to their premature graves.\r\n\r\nGossiping scenes breed gossips. Who so chatty as hotel-clerks, market\r\nwomen, auctioneers, bar-keepers, apothecaries, newspaper-reporters,\r\nmonthly-nurses, and all those who live in bustling crowds, or are\r\npresent at scenes of chatty interest.\r\n\r\nSolitude breeds taciturnity; _that_ every body knows; who so taciturn\r\nas authors, taken as a race?\r\n\r\nA forced, interior quietude, in the midst of great out-ward commotion,\r\nbreeds moody people. Who so moody as railroad-brakemen,\r\nsteam-boat-engineers, helmsmen, and tenders of power-looms in cotton\r\nfactories? For all these must hold their peace while employed, and let\r\nthe machinery do the chatting; they cannot even edge in a single\r\nsyllable.\r\n\r\nNow, this theory about the wondrous influence of habitual sights and\r\nsounds upon the human temper, was suggested by my experiences on board\r\nour frigate. And al-though I regard the example furnished by our\r\nquarter-gunners—especially him who had once been our top-mate—as by far\r\nthe strongest argument in favour of the general theory; yet, the entire\r\nship abounded with illustrations of its truth. Who were more\r\nliberal-hearted, lofty-minded, gayer, more jocund, elastic,\r\nadventurous, given to fun and frolic, than the top-men of the fore,\r\nmain, and mizzen masts? The reason of their liberal-heartedness was,\r\nthat they were daily called upon to expatiate themselves all over the\r\nrigging. The reason of their lofty-mindedness was, that they were high\r\nlifted above the petty tumults, carping cares, and paltrinesses of the\r\ndecks below.\r\n\r\nAnd I feel persuaded in my inmost soul, that it is to the fact of my\r\nhaving been a main-top-man; and especially my particular post being on\r\nthe loftiest yard of the frigate, the main-royal-yard; that I am now\r\nenabled to give such a free, broad, off-hand, bird’s-eye, and, more\r\nthan all, impartial account of our man-of-war world; withholding\r\nnothing; inventing nothing; nor flattering, nor scandalising any; but\r\nmeting out to all—commodore and messenger-boy alike—their precise\r\ndescriptions and deserts.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the mirthfulness of these top-men was, that they always\r\nlooked out upon the blue, boundless, dimpled, laughing, sunny sea. Nor\r\ndo I hold, that it militates against this theory, that of a stormy day,\r\nwhen the face of the ocean was black, and overcast, that some of them\r\nwould grow moody, and chose to sit apart. On the contrary, it only\r\nproves the thing which I maintain. For even on shore, there are many\r\npeople naturally gay and light-hearted, who, whenever the autumnal wind\r\nbegins to bluster round the corners, and roar along the chimney-stacks,\r\nstraight becomes cross, petulant, and irritable. What is more mellow\r\nthan fine old ale? Yet thunder will sour the best nut-brown ever\r\nbrewed.\r\n\r\nThe _Holders_ of our frigate, the Troglodytes, who lived down in the\r\ntarry cellars and caves below the berth-deck, were, nearly all of them,\r\nmen of gloomy dispositions, taking sour views of things; one of them\r\nwas a blue-light Calvinist. Whereas, the old-sheet-anchor-men, who\r\nspent their time in the bracing sea-air and broad-cast sunshine of the\r\nforecastle, were free, generous-hearted, charitable, and full of\r\ngood-will to all hands; though some of them, to tell the truth, proved\r\nsad exceptions; but exceptions only prove the rule.\r\n\r\nThe “steady-cooks” on the berth-deck, the “steady-sweepers,” and\r\n“steady-spit-box-musterers,” in all divisions of the frigate, fore and\r\naft, were a narrow-minded set; with contracted souls; imputable, no\r\ndoubt, to their groveling duties. More especially was this evinced in\r\nthe case of those odious ditchers and night scavengers, the ignoble\r\n“Waisters.”\r\n\r\nThe members of the band, some ten or twelve in number, who had nothing\r\nto do but keep their instruments polished, and play a lively air now\r\nand then, to stir the stagnant current in our poor old Commodore’s\r\ntorpid veins, were the most gleeful set of fellows you ever saw. They\r\nwere Portuguese, who had been shipped at the Cape De Verd islands, on\r\nthe passage out. They messed by themselves; forming a dinner-party, not\r\nto be exceeded ire mirthfulness, by a club of young bridegrooms, three\r\nmonths after marriage, completely satisfied with their bargains, after\r\ntesting them.\r\n\r\nBut what made them, now, so full of fun? What indeed but their merry,\r\nmartial, mellow calling. Who could he a churl, and play a flageolet?\r\nwho mean and spiritless, braying forth the souls of thousand heroes\r\nfrom his brazen trump? But still more efficacious, perhaps, in\r\nministering to the light spirits of the band, was the consoling\r\nthought, that should the ship ever go into action, they would be\r\nexempted from the perils of battle. In ships of war, the members of the\r\n“music,” as the band is called, are generally non-combatants; and\r\nmostly ship, with the express understanding, that as soon as the vessel\r\ncomes within long gun-shot of an enemy, they shall have the privilege\r\nof burrowing down in the cable-tiers, or sea coal-hole. Which shows\r\nthat they are inglorious, but uncommonly sensible fellows.\r\n\r\nLook at the barons of the gun-room—Lieutenants, Purser, Marine\r\nofficers, Sailing-master—all of them gentlemen with stiff upper lips,\r\nand aristocratic cut noses. Why was this? Will any one deny, that from\r\ntheir living so long in high military life, served by a crowd of menial\r\nstewards and cot-boys, and always accustomed to command right and left;\r\nwill any one deny, I say, that by reason of this, their very noses had\r\nbecome thin, peaked, aquiline, and aristocratically cartilaginous? Even\r\nold Cuticle, the Surgeon, had a Roman nose.\r\n\r\nBut I never could account how it came to be, that our grey headed First\r\nLieutenant was a little lop-sided; that is, one of his shoulders\r\ndisproportionately dropped. And when I observed, that nearly all the\r\nFirst Lieutenants I saw in other men-of-war, besides many Second and\r\nThird Lieutenants, were similarly lop-sided, I knew that there must be\r\nsome general law which induced the phenomenon; and I put myself to\r\nstudying it out, as an interesting problem. At last, I came to the\r\nconclusion—to which I still adhere—that their so long wearing only one\r\nepaulet (for to only one does their rank entitle them) was the\r\ninfallible clew to this mystery. And when any one reflects upon so\r\nwell-known a fact, that many sea Lieutenants grow decrepit from age,\r\nwithout attaining a Captaincy and wearing _two_ epaulets, which would\r\nstrike the balance between their shoulders, the above reason assigned\r\nwill not appear unwarrantable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\nA MAN-OF-WAR HERMIT IN A MOB.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe allusion to the poet Lemsford in a previous chapter, leads me to\r\nspeak of our mutual friends, Nord and Williams, who, with Lemsford\r\nhimself, Jack Chase, and my comrades of the main-top, comprised almost\r\nthe only persons with whom I unreservedly consorted while on board the\r\nfrigate. For I had not been long on board ere I found that it would not\r\ndo to be intimate with everybody. An indiscriminate intimacy with all\r\nhands leads to sundry annoyances and scrapes, too often ending with a\r\ndozen at the gang-way. Though I was above a year in the frigate, there\r\nwere scores of men who to the last remained perfect strangers to me,\r\nwhose very names I did not know, and whom I would hardly be able to\r\nrecognise now should I happen to meet them in the streets.\r\n\r\nIn the dog-watches at sea, during the early part of the evening, the\r\nmain-deck is generally filled with crowds of pedestrians, promenading\r\nup and down past the guns, like people taking the air in Broadway. At\r\nsuch times, it is curious to see the men nodding to each other’s\r\nrecognitions (they might not have seen each other for a week);\r\nexchanging a pleasant word with a friend; making a hurried appointment\r\nto meet him somewhere aloft on the morrow, or passing group after group\r\nwithout deigning the slightest salutation. Indeed, I was not at all\r\nsingular in having but comparatively few acquaintances on board, though\r\ncertainly carrying my fastidiousness to an unusual extent.\r\n\r\nMy friend Nord was a somewhat remarkable character; and if mystery\r\nincludes romance, he certainly was a very romantic one. Before seeking\r\nan introduction to him through Lemsford, I had often marked his tall,\r\nspare, upright figure stalking like Don Quixote among the pigmies of\r\nthe Afterguard, to which he belonged. At first I found him exceedingly\r\nreserved and taciturn; his saturnine brow wore a scowl; he was almost\r\nrepelling in his demeanour. In a word, he seemed desirous of hinting,\r\nthat his list of man-of war friends was already made up, complete, and\r\nfull; and there was no room for more. But observing that the only man\r\nhe ever consorted with was Lemsford, I had too much magnanimity, by\r\ngoing off in a pique at his coldness, to let him lose forever the\r\nchance of making so capital an acquaintance as myself. Besides, I saw\r\nit in his eye, that the man had been a reader of good books; I would\r\nhave staked my life on it, that he seized the right meaning of\r\nMontaigne. I saw that he was an earnest thinker; I more than suspected\r\nthat he had been bolted in the mill of adversity. For all these things,\r\nmy heart yearned toward him; I determined to know him.\r\n\r\nAt last I succeeded; it was during a profoundly quiet midnight watch,\r\nwhen I perceived him walking alone in the waist, while most of the men\r\nwere dozing on the carronade-slides.\r\n\r\nThat night we scoured all the prairies of reading; dived into the\r\nbosoms of authors, and tore out their hearts; and that night\r\nWhite-Jacket learned more than he has ever done in any single night\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThe man was a marvel. He amazed me, as much as Coleridge did the\r\ntroopers among whom he enlisted. What could have induced such a man to\r\nenter a man-of-war, all my sapience cannot fathom. And how he managed\r\nto preserve his dignity, as he did, among such a rabble rout was\r\nequally a mystery. For he was no sailor; as ignorant of a ship, indeed,\r\nas a man from the sources of the Niger. Yet the officers respected him;\r\nand the men were afraid of him. This much was observable, however, that\r\nhe faithfully discharged whatever special duties devolved upon him; and\r\nwas so fortunate as never to render himself liable to a reprimand.\r\nDoubtless, he took the same view of the thing that another of the crew\r\ndid; and had early resolved, so to conduct himself as never to run the\r\nrisk of the scourge. And this it must have been—added to whatever\r\nincommunicable grief which might have been his—that made this Nord such\r\na wandering recluse, even among our man-of-war mob. Nor could he have\r\nlong swung his hammock on board, ere he must have found that, to insure\r\nhis exemption from that thing which alone affrighted him, he must be\r\ncontent for the most part to turn a man-hater, and socially expatriate\r\nhimself from many things, which might have rendered his situation more\r\ntolerable. Still more, several events that took place must have\r\nhorrified him, at times, with the thought that, however he might\r\nisolate and entomb himself, yet for all this, the improbability of his\r\nbeing overtaken by what he most dreaded never advanced to the\r\ninfallibility of the impossible.\r\n\r\nIn my intercourse with Nord, he never made allusion to his past\r\ncareer—a subject upon which most high-bred castaways in a man-of-war\r\nare very diffuse; relating their adventures at the gaming-table; the\r\nrecklessness with which they have run through the amplest fortunes in a\r\nsingle season; their alms-givings, and gratuities to porters and poor\r\nrelations; and above all, their youthful indiscretions, and the\r\nbroken-hearted ladies they have left behind. No such tales had Nord to\r\ntell. Concerning the past, he was barred and locked up like the specie\r\nvaults of the Bank of England. For anything that dropped from him, none\r\nof us could be sure that he had ever existed till now. Altogether, he\r\nwas a remarkable man.\r\n\r\nMy other friend, Williams, was a thorough-going Yankee from Maine, who\r\nhad been both a peddler and a pedagogue in his day. He had all manner\r\nof stories to tell about nice little country frolics, and would run\r\nover an endless list of his sweethearts. He was honest, acute, witty,\r\nfull of mirth and good humour—a laughing philosopher. He was invaluable\r\nas a pill against the spleen; and, with the view of extending the\r\nadvantages of his society to the saturnine Nord, I introduced them to\r\neach other; but Nord cut him dead the very same evening, when we\r\nsallied out from between the guns for a walk on the main-deck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nA DRAUGHT IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were not many days out of port, when a rumour was set afloat that\r\ndreadfully alarmed many tars. It was this: that, owing to some\r\nunprecedented oversight in the Purser, or some equally unprecedented\r\nremissness in the Naval-storekeeper at Callao, the frigate’s supply of\r\nthat delectable beverage, called “grog,” was well-nigh expended.\r\n\r\nIn the American Navy, the law allows one gill of spirits per day to\r\nevery seaman. In two portions, it is served out just previous to\r\nbreakfast and dinner. At the roll of the drum, the sailors assemble\r\nround a large tub, or cask, filled with liquid; and, as their names are\r\ncalled off by a midshipman, they step up and regale themselves from a\r\nlittle tin measure called a “tot.” No high-liver helping himself to\r\nTokay off a well-polished sideboard, smacks his lips with more mighty\r\nsatisfaction than the sailor does over this _tot_. To many of them,\r\nindeed, the thought of their daily _tots_ forms a perpetual perspective\r\nof ravishing landscapes, indefinitely receding in the distance. It is\r\ntheir great “prospect in life.” Take away their grog, and life\r\npossesses no further charms for them. It is hardly to be doubted, that\r\nthe controlling inducement which keeps many men in the Navy, is the\r\nunbounded confidence they have in the ability of the United States\r\ngovernment to supply them, regularly and unfailingly, with their daily\r\nallowance of this beverage. I have known several forlorn individuals,\r\nshipping as landsmen, who have confessed to me, that having contracted\r\na love for ardent spirits, which they could not renounce, and having by\r\ntheir foolish courses been brought into the most abject\r\npoverty—insomuch that they could no longer gratify their thirst\r\nashore—they incontinently entered the Navy; regarding it as the asylum\r\nfor all drunkards, who might there prolong their lives by regular hours\r\nand exercise, and twice every day quench their thirst by moderate and\r\nundeviating doses.\r\n\r\nWhen I once remonstrated with an old toper of a top-man about this\r\ndaily dram-drinking; when I told him it was ruining him, and advised\r\nhim to _stop his grog_ and receive the money for it, in addition to his\r\nwages as provided by law, he turned about on me, with an irresistibly\r\nwaggish look, and said, “Give up my grog? And why? Because it is\r\nruining me? No, no; I am a good Christian, White-Jacket, and love my\r\nenemy too much to drop his acquaintance.”\r\n\r\nIt may be readily imagined, therefore, what consternation and dismay\r\npervaded the gun-deck at the first announcement of the tidings that the\r\ngrog was expended.\r\n\r\n“The grog gone!” roared an old Sheet-anchor-man.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Lord! what a pain in my stomach!” cried a Main-top-man.\r\n\r\n“It’s worse than the cholera!” cried a man of the After-guard.\r\n\r\n“I’d sooner the water-casks would give out!” said a Captain of the\r\nHold.\r\n\r\n“Are we ganders and geese, that we can live without grog?” asked a\r\nCorporal of Marines.\r\n\r\n“Ay, we must now drink with the ducks!” cried a Quarter-master.\r\n\r\n“Not a tot left?” groaned a Waister.\r\n\r\n“Not a toothful!” sighed a Holder, from the bottom of his boots.\r\n\r\nYes, the fatal intelligence proved true. The drum was no longer heard\r\nrolling the men to the tub, and deep gloom and dejection fell like a\r\ncloud. The ship was like a great city, when some terrible calamity has\r\novertaken it. The men stood apart, in groups, discussing their woes,\r\nand mutually condoling. No longer, of still moonlight nights, was the\r\nsong heard from the giddy tops; and few and far between were the\r\nstories that were told. It was during this interval, so dismal to many,\r\nthat to the amazement of all hands, ten men were reported by the\r\nmaster-at-arms to be intoxicated. They were brought up to the mast, and\r\nat their appearance the doubts of the most skeptical were dissipated;\r\nbut whence they had obtained their liquor no one could tell. It was\r\nobserved, however at the time, that the tarry knaves all smelled of\r\nlavender, like so many dandies.\r\n\r\nAfter their examination they were ordered into the “brig,” a jail-house\r\nbetween two guns on the main-deck, where prisoners are kept. Here they\r\nlaid for some time, stretched out stark and stiff, with their arms\r\nfolded over their breasts, like so many effigies of the Black Prince on\r\nhis monument in Canterbury Cathedral.\r\n\r\nTheir first slumbers over, the marine sentry who stood guard over them\r\nhad as much as he could do to keep off the crowd, who were all\r\neagerness to find out how, in such a time of want, the prisoners had\r\nmanaged to drink themselves into oblivion. In due time they were\r\nliberated, and the secret simultaneously leaked out.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that an enterprising man of their number, who had suffered\r\nseverely from the common deprivation, had all at once been struck by a\r\nbrilliant idea. It had come to his knowledge that the purser’s steward\r\nwas supplied with a large quantity of _Eau-de-Cologne_, clandestinely\r\nbrought out in the ship, for the purpose of selling it on his own\r\naccount, to the people of the coast; but the supply proving larger than\r\nthe demand, and having no customers on board the frigate but Lieutenant\r\nSelvagee, he was now carrying home more than a third of his original\r\nstock. To make a short story of it, this functionary, being called upon\r\nin secret, was readily prevailed upon to part with a dozen bottles,\r\nwith whose contents the intoxicated party had regaled themselves.\r\n\r\nThe news spread far and wide among the men, being only kept secret from\r\nthe officers and underlings, and that night the long, crane-necked\r\nCologne bottles jingled in out-of-the-way corners and by-places, and,\r\nbeing emptied, were sent flying out of the ports. With brown sugar,\r\ntaken from the mess-chests, and hot water begged from the galley-cooks,\r\nthe men made all manner of punches, toddies, and cocktails, letting\r\nfall therein a small drop of tar, like a bit of brown toast, by way of\r\nimparting a flavour. Of course, the thing was managed with the utmost\r\nsecrecy; and as a whole dark night elapsed after their orgies, the\r\nrevellers were, in a good measure, secure from detection; and those who\r\nindulged too freely had twelve long hours to get sober before daylight\r\nobtruded.\r\n\r\nNext day, fore and aft, the whole frigate smelled like a lady’s toilet;\r\nthe very tar-buckets were fragrant; and from the mouth of many a grim,\r\ngrizzled old quarter-gunner came the most fragrant of breaths. The\r\namazed Lieutenants went about snuffing up the gale; and, for once.\r\nSelvagee had no further need to flourish his perfumed hand-kerchief. It\r\nwas as if we were sailing by some odoriferous shore, in the vernal\r\nseason of violets. Sabaean odours!\r\n\r\n                      “For many a league,\r\n      Cheered with grateful smell, old Ocean smiled.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBut, alas! all this perfume could not be wasted for nothing; and the\r\nmasters-at-arms and ship’s corporals, putting this and that together,\r\nvery soon burrowed into the secret. The purser’s steward was called to\r\naccount, and no more lavender punches and Cologne toddies were drank on\r\nboard the Neversink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nA SALT-JUNK CLUB IN A MAN-OF-WAR, WITH A NOTICE TO QUIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about the period of the Cologne-water excitement that my\r\nself-conceit was not a little wounded, and my sense of delicacy\r\naltogether shocked, by a polite hint received from the cook of the mess\r\nto which I happened to belong. To understand the matter, it is needful\r\nto enter into preliminaries.\r\n\r\nThe common seamen in a large frigate are divided into some thirty or\r\nforty messes, put down on the purser’s books as _Mess_ No. 1, _Mess_\r\nNo. 2, _Mess_ No. 3, etc. The members of each mess club, their rations\r\nof provisions, and breakfast, dine, and sup together in allotted\r\nintervals between the guns on the main-deck. In undeviating rotation,\r\nthe members of each mess (excepting the petty-officers) take their turn\r\nin performing the functions of cook and steward. And for the time\r\nbeing, all the affairs of the club are subject to their inspection and\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nIt is the cook’s business, also, to have an eye to the general\r\ninterests of his mess; to see that, when the aggregated allowances of\r\nbeef, bread, etc., are served out by one of the master’s mates, the\r\nmess over which he presides receives its full share, without stint or\r\nsubtraction. Upon the berth-deck he has a chest, in which to keep his\r\npots, pans, spoons, and small stores of sugar, molasses, tea, and\r\nflour.\r\n\r\nBut though entitled a cook, strictly speaking, the head of the mess is\r\nno cook at all; for the cooking for the crew is all done by a high and\r\nmighty functionary, officially called the “_ship’s cook_,” assisted by\r\nseveral deputies. In our frigate, this personage was a dignified\r\ncoloured gentleman, whom the men dubbed “_Old Coffee;_” and his\r\nassistants, negroes also, went by the poetical appellations of\r\n“_Sunshine_,” “_Rose-water_,” and “_May-day_.”\r\n\r\nNow the _ship’s cooking_ required very little science, though old\r\nCoffee often assured us that he had graduated at the New York Astor\r\nHouse, under the immediate eye of the celebrated Coleman and Stetson.\r\nAll he had to do was, in the first place, to keep bright and clean the\r\nthree huge coppers, or caldrons, in which many hundred pounds of beef\r\nwere daily boiled. To this end, Rose-water, Sunshine, and May-day every\r\nmorning sprang into their respective apartments, stripped to the waist,\r\nand well provided with bits of soap-stone and sand. By exercising these\r\nin a very vigorous manner, they threw themselves into a violent\r\nperspiration, and put a fine polish upon the interior of the coppers.\r\n\r\nSunshine was the bard of the trio; and while all three would be busily\r\nemployed clattering their soap-stones against the metal, he would\r\nexhilarate them with some remarkable St. Domingo melodies; one of which\r\nwas the following:\r\n\r\n     “Oh! I los’ my shoe in an old canoe,\r\n          Johnio! come Winum so!\r\n      Oh! I los’ my boot in a pilot-boat,\r\n          Johnio! come Winum so!\r\n      Den rub-a-dub de copper, oh!\r\n      Oh! copper rub-a-dub-a-oh!”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I listened to these jolly Africans, thus making gleeful their toil\r\nby their cheering songs, I could not help murmuring against that\r\nimmemorial rule of men-of-war, which forbids the sailors to sing out,\r\nas in merchant-vessels, when pulling ropes, or occupied at any other\r\nship’s duty. Your only music, at such times, is the shrill pipe of the\r\nboatswain’s mate, which is almost worse than no music at all. And if\r\nthe boatswain’s mate is not by, you must pull the ropes, like convicts,\r\nin profound silence; or else endeavour to impart unity to the exertions\r\nof all hands, by singing out mechanically, _one_, _two_, _three_, and\r\nthen pulling all together.\r\n\r\nNow, when Sunshine, Rose-water, and May-day have so polished the ship’s\r\ncoppers, that a white kid glove might be drawn along the inside and\r\nshow no stain, they leap out of their holes, and the water is poured in\r\nfor the coffee. And the coffee being boiled, and decanted off in\r\nbucketfuls, the cooks of the messes march up with their salt beef for\r\ndinner, strung upon strings and tallied with labels; all of which are\r\nplunged together into the self-same coppers, and there boiled. When,\r\nupon the beef being fished out with a huge pitch-fork, the water for\r\nthe evening’s tea is poured in; which, consequently possesses a flavour\r\nnot unlike that of shank-soup.\r\n\r\nFrom this it will be seen, that, so far as cooking is concerned, a\r\n“_cook of the mess_” has very little to do; merely carrying his\r\nprovisions to and from the grand democratic cookery. Still, in some\r\nthings, his office involves many annoyances. Twice a week butter and\r\ncheese are served out—so much to each man—and the mess-cook has the\r\nsole charge of these delicacies. The great difficulty consists in so\r\ncatering for the mess, touching these luxuries, as to satisfy all. Some\r\nguzzlers are for devouring the butter at a meal, and finishing off with\r\nthe cheese the same day; others contend for saving it up against\r\n_Banyan Day_, when there is nothing but beef and bread; and others,\r\nagain, are for taking a very small bit of butter and cheese, by way of\r\ndessert, to each and every meal through the week. All this gives rise\r\nto endless disputes, debates, and altercations.\r\n\r\nSometimes, with his mess-cloth—a square of painted canvas—set out on\r\ndeck between the guns, garnished with pots, and pans, and _kids_, you\r\nsee the mess-cook seated on a matchtub at its head, his trowser legs\r\nrolled up and arms bared, presiding over the convivial party.\r\n\r\n“Now, men, you can’t have any butter to-day. I’m saving it up for\r\nto-morrow. You don’t know the value of butter, men. You, Jim, take your\r\nhoof off the cloth! Devil take me, if some of you chaps haven’t no more\r\nmanners than so many swines! Quick, men, quick; bear a hand, and\r\n‘_scoff_’ (eat) away.—I’ve got my to-morrow’s _duff_ to make yet, and\r\nsome of you fellows keep _scoffing_ as if I had nothing to do but sit\r\nstill here on this here tub here, and look on. There, there, men,\r\nyou’ve all had enough: so sail away out of this, and let me clear up\r\nthe wreck.”\r\n\r\nIn this strain would one of the periodical cooks of mess No. 15 talk to\r\nus. He was a tall, resolute fellow, who had once been a brakeman on a\r\nrailroad, and he kept us all pretty straight; from his fiat there was\r\nno appeal.\r\n\r\nBut it was not thus when the turn came to others among us. Then it was\r\n_look out for squalls_. The business of dining became a bore, and\r\ndigestion was seriously impaired by the unamiable discourse we had over\r\nour _salt horse_.\r\n\r\nI sometimes thought that the junks of lean pork—which were boiled in\r\ntheir own bristles, and looked gaunt and grim, like pickled chins of\r\nhalf-famished, unwashed Cossacks—had something to do with creating the\r\nbristling bitterness at times prevailing in our mess. The men tore off\r\nthe tough hide from their pork, as if they were Indians scalping\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nSome cursed the cook for a rogue, who kept from us our butter and\r\ncheese, in order to make away with it himself in an underhand manner;\r\nselling it at a premium to other messes, and thus accumulating a\r\nprincely fortune at our expense. Others anthematised him for his\r\nslovenliness, casting hypercritical glances into their pots and pans,\r\nand scraping them with their knives. Then he would be railed at for his\r\nmiserable “duffs,” and other shortcoming preparations.\r\n\r\nMarking all this from the beginning, I, White-Jacket, was sorely\r\ntroubled with the idea, that, in the course of time, my own turn would\r\ncome round to undergo the same objurgations. How to escape, I knew not.\r\nHowever, when the dreaded period arrived, I received the keys of office\r\n(the keys of the mess-chest) with a resigned temper, and offered up a\r\ndevout ejaculation for fortitude under the trial. I resolved, please\r\nHeaven, to approve myself an unexceptionable caterer, and the most\r\nimpartial of stewards.\r\n\r\nThe first day there was “_duff_” to make—a business which devolved upon\r\nthe mess-cooks, though the boiling of it pertained to Old Coffee and\r\nhis deputies. I made up my mind to lay myself out on that _duff_; to\r\ncentre all my energies upon it; to put the very soul of art into it,\r\nand achieve an unrivalled _duff_—a _duff_ that should put out of\r\nconceit all other _duffs_, and for ever make my administration\r\nmemorable.\r\n\r\nFrom the proper functionary the flour was obtained, and the raisins;\r\nthe beef-fat, or “_slush_,” from Old Coffee; and the requisite supply\r\nof water from the scuttle-butt. I then went among the various cooks, to\r\ncompare their receipts for making “duffs:” and having well weighed them\r\nall, and gathered from each a choice item to make an original receipt\r\nof my own, with due deliberation and solemnity I proceeded to business.\r\nPlacing the component parts in a tin pan, I kneaded them together for\r\nan hour, entirely reckless as to pulmonary considerations, touching the\r\nruinous expenditure of breath; and having decanted the semi-liquid\r\ndough into a canvas-bag, secured the muzzle, tied on the tally, and\r\ndelivered it to Rose-water, who dropped the precious bag into the\r\ncoppers, along with a score or two of others.\r\n\r\nEight bells had struck. The boatswain and his mates had piped the hands\r\nto dinner; my mess-cloth was set out, and my messmates were assembled,\r\nknife in hand, all ready to precipitate themselves upon the devoted\r\n_duff_: Waiting at the grand cookery till my turn came, I received the\r\nbag of pudding, and gallanting it into the mess, proceeded to loosen\r\nthe string.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious, I may say, a fearful moment. My hands trembled;\r\nevery eye was upon me; my reputation and credit were at stake. Slowly I\r\nundressed the _duff_, dandling it upon my knee, much as a nurse does a\r\nbaby about bed-time. The excitement increased, as I curled down the bag\r\nfrom the pudding; it became intense, when at last I plumped it into the\r\npan, held up to receive it by an eager hand. Bim! it fell like a man\r\nshot down in a riot. Distraction! It was harder than a sinner’s heart;\r\nyea, tough as the cock that crowed on the morn that Peter told a lie.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen of the mess, for heaven’s sake! permit me one word. I have\r\ndone my duty by that duff—I have——”\r\n\r\nBut they beat down my excuses with a storm of criminations. One present\r\nproposed that the fatal pudding should be tied round my neck, like a\r\nmill-stone, and myself pushed overboard. No use, no use; I had failed;\r\never after, that duff lay heavy at my stomach and my heart.\r\n\r\nAfter this, I grew desperate; despised popularity; returned scorn for\r\nscorn; till at length my week expired, and in the duff-bag I\r\ntransferred the keys of office to the next man on the roll.\r\n\r\nSomehow, there had never been a very cordial feeling between this mess\r\nand me; all along they had nourished a prejudice against my white\r\njacket. They must have harbored the silly fancy that in it I gave\r\nmyself airs, and wore it in order to look consequential; perhaps, as a\r\ncloak to cover pilferings of tit-bits from the mess. But to out with\r\nthe plain truth, they themselves were not a very irreproachable set.\r\nConsidering the sequel I am coming to, this avowal may be deemed sheer\r\nmalice; but for all that, I cannot avoid speaking my mind.\r\n\r\nAfter my week of office, the mess gradually changed their behaviour to\r\nme; they cut me to the heart; they became cold and reserved; seldom or\r\nnever addressed me at meal-times without invidious allusions to my\r\n_duff_, and also to my jacket, and its dripping in wet weather upon the\r\nmess-cloth. However, I had no idea that anything serious, on their\r\npart, was brewing; but alas! so it turned out.\r\n\r\nWe were assembled at supper one evening when I noticed certain winks\r\nand silent hints tipped to the cook, who presided. He was a little,\r\noily fellow, who had once kept an oyster-cellar ashore; he bore me a\r\ngrudge. Looking down on the mess-cloth, he observed that some fellows\r\nnever knew when their room was better than their company. This being a\r\nmaxim of indiscriminate application, of course I silently assented to\r\nit, as any other reasonable man would have done. But this remark was\r\nfollowed up by another, to the effect that, not only did some fellows\r\nnever know when their room was better than their company, but they\r\npersisted in staying when their company wasn’t wanted; and by so doing\r\ndisturbed the serenity of society at large. But this, also, was a\r\ngeneral observation that could not be gainsaid. A long and ominous\r\npause ensued; during which I perceived every eye upon me, and my white\r\njacket; while the cook went on to enlarge upon the disagreeableness of\r\na perpetually damp garment in the mess, especially when that garment\r\nwas white. This was coming nearer home.\r\n\r\nYes, they were going to black-ball me; but I resolved to sit it out a\r\nlittle longer; never dreaming that my moralist would proceed to\r\nextremities, while all hands were present. But bethinking him that by\r\ngoing this roundabout way he would never get at his object, he went off\r\non another tack; apprising me, in substance, that he was instructed by\r\nthe whole mess, then and there assembled, to give me warning to seek\r\nout another club, as they did not longer fancy the society either of\r\nmyself or my jacket.\r\n\r\nI was shocked. Such a want of tact and delicacy! Common propriety\r\nsuggested that a point-blank intimation of that nature should be\r\nconveyed in a private interview; or, still better, by note. I\r\nimmediately rose, tucked my jacket about me, bowed, and departed.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to do myself justice, I must add that, the next day, I was\r\nreceived with open arms by a glorious set of fellows—Mess No.\r\n1!—numbering, among the rest, my noble Captain Jack Chase.\r\n\r\nThis mess was principally composed of the headmost men of the gun-deck;\r\nand, out of a pardonable self-conceit, they called themselves the\r\n“_Forty-two-pounder Club;_” meaning that they were, one and all,\r\nfellows of large intellectual and corporeal calibre. Their mess-cloth\r\nwas well located. On their starboard hand was Mess No. 2, embracing\r\nsundry rare jokers and high livers, who waxed gay and epicurean over\r\ntheir salt fare, and were known as the “_Society for the Destruction of\r\nBeef and Pork_.” On the larboard hand was Mess No. 31, made up entirely\r\nof fore-top-men, a dashing, blaze-away set of men-of-war’s-men, who\r\ncalled themselves the “_Cape Horn Snorters and Neversink Invincibles_.”\r\nOpposite, was one of the marine messes, mustering the aristocracy of\r\nthe marine corps—the two corporals, the drummer and fifer, and some six\r\nor eight rather gentlemanly privates, native-born Americans, who had\r\nserved in the Seminole campaigns of Florida; and they now enlivened\r\ntheir salt fare with stories of wild ambushes in the Everglades; and\r\none of them related a surprising tale of his hand-to-hand encounter\r\nwith Osceola, the Indian chief, whom he fought one morning from\r\ndaybreak till breakfast time. This slashing private also boasted that\r\nhe could take a chip from between your teeth at twenty paces; he\r\noffered to bet any amount on it; and as he could get no one to hold the\r\nchip, his boast remained for ever good.\r\n\r\nBesides many other attractions which the _Forty-two-pounder Club_\r\nfurnished, it had this one special advantage, that, owing to there\r\nbeing so many _petty officers_ in it, all the members of the mess were\r\nexempt from doing duty as cooks and stewards. A fellow called _a\r\nsteady-cook_, attended to that business during the entire cruise. He\r\nwas a long, lank, pallid varlet, going by the name of Shanks. In very\r\nwarm weather this Shanks would sit at the foot of the mess-cloth,\r\nfanning himself with the front flap of his frock or shirt, which he\r\ninelegantly wore over his trousers. Jack Chase, the President of the\r\nClub, frequently remonstrated against this breach of good manners; but\r\nthe _steady-cook_ had somehow contracted the habit, and it proved\r\nincurable.\r\n\r\nFor a time, Jack Chase, out of a polite nervousness touching myself, as\r\na newly-elected member of the club, would frequently endeavour to\r\nexcuse to me the vulgarity of Shanks. One day he wound up his remarks\r\nby the philosophic reflection—“But, White-Jacket, my dear fellow, what\r\ncan you expect of him? Our real misfortune is, that our noble club\r\nshould be obliged to dine with its cook.”\r\n\r\nThere were several of these _steady-cooks_ on board; men of no mark or\r\nconsideration whatever in the ship; lost to all noble promptings;\r\nsighing for no worlds to conquer, and perfectly contented with mixing\r\ntheir _duff’s_, and spreading their mess-cloths, and mustering their\r\npots and pans together three times every day for a three years’ cruise.\r\nThey were very seldom to be seen on the spar-deck, but kept below out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\nGENERAL TRAINING IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a quiet, contemplative character, averse to uproar, undue exercise\r\nof his bodily members, and all kind of useless confusion, nothing can\r\nbe more distressing than a proceeding in all men-of-war called\r\n“_general quarters_.” And well may it be so called, since it amounts to\r\na general drawing and quartering of all the parties concerned.\r\n\r\nAs the specific object for which a man-of-war is built and put into\r\ncommission is to fight and fire off cannon, it is, of course, deemed\r\nindispensable that the crew should be duly instructed in the art and\r\nmystery involved. Hence these “general quarters,” which is a mustering\r\nof all hands to their stations at the guns on the several decks, and a\r\nsort of sham-fight with an imaginary foe.\r\n\r\nThe summons is given by the ship’s drummer, who strikes a peculiar\r\nbeat—short, broken, rolling, shuffling—like the sound made by the march\r\ninto battle of iron-heeled grenadiers. It is a regular tune, with a\r\nfine song composed to it; the words of the chorus, being most\r\nartistically arranged, may give some idea of the air:\r\n\r\n    “Hearts of oak are our ships, jolly tars are our men,\r\n     We always are ready, steady, boys, steady,\r\n     To fight and to conquer, again and again.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIn warm weather this pastime at the guns is exceedingly unpleasant, to\r\nsay the least, and throws a quiet man into a violent passion and\r\nperspiration. For one, I ever abominated it.\r\n\r\nI have a heart like Julius Caesar, and upon occasions would fight like\r\nCaius Marcius Coriolanus. If my beloved and for ever glorious country\r\nshould be ever in jeopardy from invaders, let Congress put me on a\r\nwar-horse, in the van-guard, and _then_ see how I will acquit myself.\r\nBut to toil and sweat in a fictitious encounter; to squander the\r\nprecious breath of my precious body in a ridiculous fight of shams and\r\npretensions; to hurry about the decks, pretending to carry the killed\r\nand wounded below; to be told that I must consider the ship blowing up,\r\nin order to exercise myself in presence of mind, and prepare for a real\r\nexplosion; all this I despise, as beneath a true tar and man of valour.\r\n\r\nThese were my sentiments at the time, and these remain my sentiments\r\nstill; but as, while on board the frigate, my liberty of thought did\r\nnot extend to liberty of expression, I was obliged to keep these\r\nsentiments to myself; though, indeed, I had some thoughts of addressing\r\na letter, marked _Private and Confidential_, to his Honour the\r\nCommodore, on the subject.\r\n\r\nMy station at the batteries was at one of the thirty-two-pound\r\ncarronades, on the starboard side of the quarter-deck.[1]\r\n\r\n [1] For the benefit of a Quaker reader here and there, a word or two\r\n in explanation of a carronade may not be amiss. The carronade is a gun\r\n comparatively short and light for its calibre. A carronade throwing a\r\n thirty-two-pound shot weighs considerably less than a long-gun only\r\n throwing a twenty-four-pound shot. It further differs from a long-gun,\r\n in working with a joint and bolt underneath, instead of the short arms\r\n or _trunnions_ at the sides. Its _carriage_, likewise, is quite\r\n different from that of a long-gun, having a sort of sliding apparatus,\r\n something like an extension dining-table; the goose on it, however, is\r\n a tough one, and villainously stuffed with most indigestible\r\n dumplings. Point-blank, the range of a carronade does not exceed one\r\n hundred and fifty yards, much less than the range of a long-gun. When\r\n of large calibre, however, it throws within that limit, Paixhan shot,\r\n all manner of shells and combustibles, with great effect, being a very\r\n destructive engine at close quarters. This piece is now very generally\r\n found mounted in the batteries of the English and American navies. The\r\n quarter-deck armaments of most modern frigates wholly consist of\r\n carronades. The name is derived from the village of Carron, in\r\n Scotland, at whose celebrated founderies this iron Attila was first\r\n cast.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not fancy this station at all; for it is well known on shipboard\r\nthat, in time of action, the quarter-deck is one of the most dangerous\r\nposts of a man-of-war. The reason is, that the officers of the highest\r\nrank are there stationed; and the enemy have an ungentlemanly way of\r\ntarget-shooting at their buttons. If we should chance to engage a ship,\r\nthen, who could tell but some bungling small-arm marks-man in the\r\nenemy’s tops might put a bullet through _me_ instead of the Commodore?\r\nIf they hit _him_, no doubt he would not feel it much, for he was used\r\nto that sort of thing, and, indeed, had a bullet in him already.\r\nWhereas, _I_ was altogether unaccustomed to having blue pills playing\r\nround my head in such an indiscriminate way. Besides, ours was a\r\nflag-ship; and every one knows what a peculiarly dangerous predicament\r\nthe quarter-deck of Nelson’s flag-ship was in at the battle of\r\nTrafalgar; how the lofty tops of the enemy were full of soldiers,\r\npeppering away at the English Admiral and his officers. Many a poor\r\nsailor, at the guns of that quarter-deck, must have received a bullet\r\nintended for some wearer of an epaulet.\r\n\r\nBy candidly confessing my feelings on this subject, I do by no means\r\ninvalidate my claims to being held a man of prodigious valour. I merely\r\nstate my invincible repugnance to being shot for somebody else. If I am\r\nshot, be it with the express understanding in the shooter that I am the\r\nidentical person intended so to be served. That Thracian who, with his\r\ncompliments, sent an arrow into the King of Macedon, superscribed “_for\r\nPhilip’s right eye_,” set a fine example to all warriors. The hurried,\r\nhasty, indiscriminate, reckless, abandoned manner in which both sailors\r\nand soldiers nowadays fight is really painful to any serious-minded,\r\nmethodical old gentleman, especially if he chance to have systematized\r\nhis mind as an accountant. There is little or no skill and bravery\r\nabout it. Two parties, armed with lead and old iron, envelop themselves\r\nin a cloud of smoke, and pitch their lead and old iron about in all\r\ndirections. If you happen to be in the way, you are hit; possibly,\r\nkilled; if not, you escape. In sea-actions, if by good or bad luck, as\r\nthe case may be, a round shot, fired at random through the smoke,\r\nhappens to send overboard your fore-mast, another to unship your\r\nrudder, there you lie crippled, pretty much at the mercy of your foe:\r\nwho, accordingly, pronounces himself victor, though that honour\r\nproperly belongs to the Law of Gravitation operating on the enemy’s\r\nballs in the smoke. Instead of tossing this old lead and iron into the\r\nair, therefore, it would be much better amicably to toss up a copper\r\nand let heads win.\r\n\r\nThe carronade at which I was stationed was known as “Gun No. 5,” on the\r\nFirst Lieutenant’s quarter-bill. Among our gun’s crew, however, it was\r\nknown as _Black Bet_. This name was bestowed by the captain of the\r\ngun—a fine negro—in honour of his sweetheart, a coloured lady of\r\nPhiladelphia. Of Black Bet I was rammer-and-sponger; and ram and sponge\r\nI did, like a good fellow. I have no doubt that, had I and my gun been\r\nat the battle of the Nile, we would mutually have immortalised\r\nourselves; the ramming-pole would have been hung up in Westminster\r\nAbbey; and I, ennobled by the king, besides receiving the illustrious\r\nhonour of an autograph letter from his majesty through the perfumed\r\nright hand of his private secretary.\r\n\r\nBut it was terrible work to help run in and out of the porthole that\r\namazing mass of metal, especially as the thing must be clone in a\r\ntrice. Then, at the summons of a horrid, rasping rattle, swayed by the\r\nCaptain in person, we were made to rush from our guns, seize pikes and\r\npistols, and repel an imaginary army of boarders, who, by a fiction of\r\nthe officers, were supposed to be assailing all sides of the ship at\r\nonce. After cutting and slashing at them a while, we jumped back to our\r\nguns, and again went to jerking our elbows.\r\n\r\nMeantime, a loud cry is heard of “Fire! fire! fire!” in the fore-top;\r\nand a regular engine, worked by a set of Bowery-boy tars, is forthwith\r\nset to playing streams of water aloft. And now it is “Fire! fire!\r\nfire!” on the main-deck; and the entire ship is in as great a commotion\r\nas if a whole city ward were in a blaze.\r\n\r\nAre our officers of the Navy utterly unacquainted with the laws of good\r\nhealth? Do they not know that this violent exercise, taking place just\r\nafter a hearty dinner, as it generally does, is eminently calculated to\r\nbreed the dyspepsia? There was no satisfaction in dining; the flavour\r\nof every mouthful was destroyed by the thought that the next moment the\r\ncannonading drum might be beating to quarters.\r\n\r\nSuch a sea-martinet was our Captain, that sometimes we were roused from\r\nour hammocks at night; when a scene would ensue that it is not in the\r\npower of pen and ink to describe. Five hundred men spring to their\r\nfeet, dress themselves, take up their bedding, and run to the nettings\r\nand stow it; then he to their stations—each man jostling his\r\nneighbour—some alow, some aloft; some this way, some that; and in less\r\nthan five minutes the frigate is ready for action, and still as the\r\ngrave; almost every man precisely where he would be were an enemy\r\nactually about to be engaged. The Gunner, like a Cornwall miner in a\r\ncave, is burrowing down in the magazine under the Ward-room, which is\r\nlighted by battle-lanterns, placed behind glazed glass bull’s-eyes\r\ninserted in the bulkhead. The Powder-monkeys, or boys, who fetch and\r\ncarry cartridges, are scampering to and fro among the guns; and the\r\n_first and second loaders_ stand ready to receive their supplies.\r\n\r\nThese _Powder-monkeys_, as they are called, enact a curious part in\r\ntime of action. The entrance to the magazine on the berth-deck, where\r\nthey procure their food for the guns, is guarded by a woollen screen;\r\nand a gunner’s mate, standing behind it, thrusts out the cartridges\r\nthrough a small arm-hole in this screen. The enemy’s shot (perhaps red\r\nhot) are flying in all directions; and to protect their cartridges, the\r\npowder-monkeys hurriedly wrap them up in their jackets; and with all\r\nhaste scramble up the ladders to their respective guns, like\r\neating-house waiters hurrying along with hot cakes for breakfast.\r\n\r\nAt _general quarters_ the shot-boxes are uncovered; showing the\r\ngrape-shot—aptly so called, for they precisely resemble bunches of the\r\nfruit; though, to receive a bunch of iron grapes in the abdomen would\r\nbe but a sorry dessert; and also showing the canister-shot—old iron of\r\nvarious sorts, packed in a tin case, like a tea-caddy.\r\n\r\nImagine some midnight craft sailing down on her enemy thus; twenty-four\r\npounders levelled, matches lighted, and each captain of his gun at his\r\npost!\r\n\r\nBut if verily going into action, then would the Neversink have made\r\nstill further preparations; for however alike in some things, there is\r\nalways a vast difference—if you sound them—between a reality and a\r\nsham. Not to speak of the pale sternness of the men at their guns at\r\nsuch a juncture, and the choked thoughts at their hearts, the ship\r\nitself would here and there present a far different appearance.\r\nSomething like that of an extensive mansion preparing for a grand\r\nentertainment, when folding-doors are withdrawn, chambers converted\r\ninto drawing-rooms, and every inch of available space thrown into one\r\ncontinuous whole. For previous to an action, every bulk-head in a\r\nman-of-war is knocked down; great guns are run out of the Commodore’s\r\nparlour windows; nothing separates the ward-room officers’ quarters\r\nfrom those of the men, but an ensign used for a curtain. The sailors’\r\nmess-chests are tumbled down into the hold; and the hospital cots—of\r\nwhich all men-of-war carry a large supply—are dragged forth from the\r\nsail-room, and piled near at hand to receive the wounded;\r\namputation-tables are ranged in the _cock-pit_ or in the _tiers_,\r\nwhereon to carve the bodies of the maimed. The yards are slung in\r\nchains; fire-screens distributed here and there: hillocks of\r\ncannon-balls piled between the guns; shot-plugs suspended within easy\r\nreach from the beams; and solid masses of wads, big as Dutch cheeses,\r\nbraced to the cheeks of the gun-carriages.\r\n\r\nNo small difference, also, would be visible in the wardrobe of both\r\nofficers and men. The officers generally fight as dandies dance,\r\nnamely, in silk stockings; inasmuch as, in case of being wounded in the\r\nleg, the silk-hose can be more easily drawn off by the Surgeon; cotton\r\nsticks, and works into the wound. An economical captain, while taking\r\ncare to case his legs in silk, might yet see fit to save his best suit,\r\nand fight in his old clothes. For, besides that an old garment might\r\nmuch better be cut to pieces than a new one, it must be a mighty\r\ndisagreeable thing to die in a stiff, tight-breasted coat, not yet\r\nworked easy under the arm-pits. At such times, a man should feel free,\r\nunencumbered, and perfectly at his ease in point of straps and\r\nsuspenders. No ill-will concerning his tailor should intrude upon his\r\nthoughts of eternity. Seneca understood this, when he chose to die\r\nnaked in a bath. And men-of-war’s men understand it, also; for most of\r\nthem, in battle, strip to the waist-bands; wearing nothing but a pair\r\nof duck trowsers, and a handkerchief round their head.\r\n\r\nA captain combining a heedful patriotism with economy would probably\r\n“bend” his old topsails before going into battle, instead of exposing\r\nhis best canvas to be riddled to pieces; for it is generally the case\r\nthat the enemy’s shot flies high. Unless allowance is made for it in\r\npointing the tube, at long-gun distance, the slightest roll of the\r\nship, at the time of firing, would send a shot, meant for the hull,\r\nhigh over the top-gallant yards.\r\n\r\nBut besides these differences between a sham-fight at _general\r\nquarters_ and a real cannonading, the aspect of the ship, at the\r\nbeating of the retreat, would, in the latter case, be very dissimilar\r\nto the neatness and uniformity in the former.\r\n\r\n_Then_ our bulwarks might look like the walls of the houses in West\r\nBroadway in New York, after being broken into and burned out by the\r\nNegro Mob. Our stout masts and yards might be lying about decks, like\r\ntree boughs after a tornado in a piece of woodland; our dangling ropes,\r\ncut and sundered in all directions, would be bleeding tar at every\r\nyard; and strew with jagged splinters from our wounded planks, the\r\ngun-deck might resemble a carpenter’s shop. _Then_, when all was over,\r\nand all hands would be piped to take down the hammocks from the exposed\r\nnettings (where they play the part of the cotton bales at New Orleans),\r\nwe might find bits of broken shot, iron bolts and bullets in our\r\nblankets. And, while smeared with blood like butchers, the surgeon and\r\nhis mates would be amputating arms and legs on the berth-deck, an\r\nunderling of the carpenter’s gang would be new-legging and arming the\r\nbroken chairs and tables in the Commodore’s cabin; while the rest of\r\nhis _squad_ would be _splicing_ and _fishing_ the shattered masts and\r\nyards. The scupper-holes having discharged the last rivulet of blood,\r\nthe decks would be washed down; and the galley-cooks would be going\r\nfore and aft, sprinkling them with hot vinegar, to take out the\r\nshambles’ smell from the planks; which, unless some such means are\r\nemployed, often create a highly offensive effluvia for weeks after a\r\nfight.\r\n\r\n_Then_, upon mustering the men, and calling the quarter-bills by the\r\nlight of a battle-lantern, many a wounded seaman with his arm in a\r\nsling, would answer for some poor shipmate who could never more make\r\nanswer for himself:\r\n\r\n“Tom Brown?”\r\n\r\n“Killed, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Jack Jewel?”\r\n\r\n“Killed, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Joe Hardy?”\r\n\r\n“Killed, sir.”\r\n\r\nAnd opposite all these poor fellows’ names, down would go on the\r\nquarter-bills the bloody marks of red ink—a murderer’s fluid, fitly\r\nused on these occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nAWAY! SECOND, THIRD, AND FOURTH CUTTERS, AWAY!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the morning succeeding one of these _general quarters_ that we\r\npicked up a life-buoy, descried floating by.\r\n\r\nIt was a circular mass of cork, about eight inches thick and four feet\r\nin diameter, covered with tarred canvas. All round its circumference\r\nthere trailed a number of knotted ropes’-ends, terminating in fanciful\r\nTurks’ heads. These were the life-lines, for the drowning to clutch.\r\nInserted into the middle of the cork was an upright, carved pole,\r\nsomewhat shorter than a pike-staff. The whole buoy was embossed with\r\nbarnacles, and its sides festooned with sea-weeds. Dolphins were\r\nsporting and flashing around it, and one white bird was hovering over\r\nthe top of the pole. Long ago, this thing must have been thrown\r\nover-board to save some poor wretch, who must have been drowned; while\r\neven the life-buoy itself had drifted away out of sight.\r\n\r\nThe forecastle-men fished it up from the bows, and the seamen thronged\r\nround it.\r\n\r\n“Bad luck! bad luck!” cried the Captain of the Head; “we’ll number one\r\nless before long.”\r\n\r\nThe ship’s cooper strolled by; he, to whose department it belongs to\r\nsee that the ship’s life-buoys are kept in good order.\r\n\r\nIn men-of-war, night and day, week in and week out, two life-buoys are\r\nkept depending from the stern; and two men, with hatchets in their\r\nhands, pace up and down, ready at the first cry to cut the cord and\r\ndrop the buoys overboard. Every two hours they are regularly relieved,\r\nlike sentinels on guard. No similar precautions are adopted in the\r\nmerchant or whaling service.\r\n\r\nThus deeply solicitous to preserve human life are the regulations of\r\nmen-of-war; and seldom has there been a better illustration of this\r\nsolicitude than at the battle of Trafalgar, when, after “several\r\nthousand” French seamen had been destroyed, according to Lord\r\nCollingwood, and, by the official returns, sixteen hundred and ninety\r\nEnglishmen were killed or wounded, the Captains of the surviving ships\r\nordered the life-buoy sentries from their death-dealing guns to their\r\nvigilant posts, as officers of the Humane Society.\r\n\r\n“There, Bungs!” cried Scrimmage, a sheet-anchor-man,[2] “there’s a good\r\npattern for you; make us a brace of life-buoys like that; something\r\nthat will save a man, and not fill and sink under him, as those leaky\r\nquarter-casks of yours will the first time there’s occasion to drop\r\n’ern. I came near pitching off the bowsprit the other day; and, when I\r\nscrambled inboard again, I went aft to get a squint at ’em. Why, Bungs,\r\nthey are all open between the staves. Shame on you! Suppose you\r\nyourself should fall over-board, and find yourself going down with\r\nbuoys under you of your own making—what then?”\r\n\r\n [2] In addition to the _Bower-anchors_ carried on her bows, a frigate\r\n carries large anchors in her fore-chains, called _Sheet-anchors_.\r\n Hence, the old seamen stationed in that part of a man-of-war are\r\n called _sheet-anchor-man_.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I never go aloft, and don’t intend to fall overboard,” replied Bungs.\r\n\r\n“Don’t believe it!” cried the sheet-anchor-man; “you lopers that live\r\nabout the decks here are nearer the bottom of the sea than the light\r\nhand that looses the main-royal. Mind your eye, Bungs—mind your eye!”\r\n\r\n“I will,” retorted Bungs; “and you mind yours!”\r\n\r\nNext day, just at dawn, I was startled from my hammock by the cry of\r\n“_All hands about ship and shorten sail_!” Springing up the ladders, I\r\nfound that an unknown man had fallen overboard from the chains; and\r\ndarting a glance toward the poop, perceived, from their gestures, that\r\nthe life-sentries there had cut away the buoys.\r\n\r\nIt was blowing a fresh breeze; the frigate was going fast through the\r\nwater. But the one thousand arms of five hundred men soon tossed her\r\nabout on the other tack, and checked her further headway.\r\n\r\n“Do you see him?” shouted the officer of the watch through his trumpet,\r\nhailing the main-mast-head. “Man or _buoy_, do you see either?”\r\n\r\n“See nothing, sir,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“Clear away the cutters!” was the next order. “Bugler! call away the\r\nsecond, third, and fourth cutters’ crews. Hands by the tackles!”\r\n\r\nIn less than three minutes the three boats were down; More hands were\r\nwanted in one of them, and, among others, I jumped in to make up the\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\n“Now, men, give way! and each man look out along his oar, and look\r\nsharp!” cried the officer of our boat. For a time, in perfect silence,\r\nwe slid up and down the great seething swells of the sea, but saw\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“There, it’s no use,” cried the officer; “he’s gone, whoever he is.\r\nPull away, men—pull away! they’ll be recalling us soon.”\r\n\r\n“Let him drown!” cried the strokesman; “he’s spoiled my watch below for\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“Who the devil is he?” cried another.\r\n\r\n“He’s one who’ll never have a coffin!” replied a third.\r\n\r\n“No, no! they’ll never sing out, ‘_All hands bury the dead!_’ for him,\r\nmy hearties!” cried a fourth.\r\n\r\n“Silence,” said the officer, “and look along your oars.” But the\r\nsixteen oarsmen still continued their talk; and, after pulling about\r\nfor two or three hours, we spied the recall-signal at the frigate’s\r\nfore-t’-gallant-mast-head, and returned on board, having seen no sign\r\neven of the life-buoys.\r\n\r\nThe boats were hoisted up, the yards braced forward, and away we\r\nbowled—one man less.\r\n\r\n“Muster all hands!” was now the order; when, upon calling the roll, the\r\ncooper was the only man missing.\r\n\r\n“I told you so, men,” cried the Captain of the Head; “I said we would\r\nlose a man before long.”\r\n\r\n“Bungs, is it?” cried Scrimmage, the sheet-anchor-man; “I told him his\r\nbuoys wouldn’t save a drowning man; and now he has proved it!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\nA MAN-OF-WAR FULL AS A NUT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to supply the lost cooper’s place; accordingly, word\r\nwas passed for all who belonged to that calling to muster at the\r\nmain-mast, in order that one of them might be selected. Thirteen men\r\nobeyed the summons—a circumstance illustrative of the fact that many\r\ngood handicrafts-men are lost to their trades and the world by serving\r\nin men-of-war. Indeed, from a frigate’s crew might he culled out men of\r\nall callings and vocations, from a backslidden parson to a broken-down\r\ncomedian. The Navy is the asylum for the perverse, the home of the\r\nunfortunate. Here the sons of adversity meet the children of calamity,\r\nand here the children of calamity meet the offspring of sin. Bankrupt\r\nbrokers, boot-blacks, blacklegs, and blacksmiths here assemble\r\ntogether; and cast-away tinkers, watch-makers, quill-drivers, cobblers,\r\ndoctors, farmers, and lawyers compare past experiences and talk of old\r\ntimes. Wrecked on a desert shore, a man-of-war’s crew could quickly\r\nfound an Alexandria by themselves, and fill it with all the things\r\nwhich go to make up a capital.\r\n\r\nFrequently, at one and the same time, you see every trade in operation\r\non the gun-deck—coopering, carpentering, tailoring, tinkering,\r\nblacksmithing, rope-making, preaching, gambling, and fortune-telling.\r\n\r\nIn truth, a man-of-war is a city afloat, with long avenues set out with\r\nguns instead of trees, and numerous shady lanes, courts, and by-ways.\r\nThe quarter-deck is a grand square, park, or parade ground, with a\r\ngreat Pittsfield elm, in the shape of the main-mast, at one end, and\r\nfronted at the other by the palace of the Commodore’s cabin.\r\n\r\nOr, rather, a man-of-war is a lofty, walled, and garrisoned town, like\r\nQuebec, where the thoroughfares and mostly ramparts, and peaceable\r\ncitizens meet armed sentries at every corner.\r\n\r\nOr it is like the lodging-houses in Paris, turned upside down; the\r\nfirst floor, or deck, being rented by a lord; the second, by a select\r\nclub of gentlemen; the third, by crowds of artisans; and the fourth, by\r\na whole rabble of common people.\r\n\r\nFor even thus is it in a frigate, where the commander has a whole cabin\r\nto himself and the spar-deck, the lieutenants their ward-room\r\nunderneath, and the mass of sailors swing their hammocks under all.\r\n\r\nAnd with its long rows of port-hole casements, each revealing the\r\nmuzzle of a cannon, a man-of-war resembles a three-story house in a\r\nsuspicions part of the town, with a basement of indefinite depth, and\r\nugly-looking fellows gazing out at the windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\nTHE JACKET ALOFT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain must I call attention to my white jacket, which, about this time\r\ncame near being the death of me.\r\n\r\nI am of a meditative humour, and at sea used often to mount aloft at\r\nnight, and seating myself on one of the upper yards, tuck my jacket\r\nabout me and give loose to reflection. In some ships in which. I have\r\ndone this, the sailors used to fancy that I must be studying\r\nastronomy—which, indeed, to some extent, was the case—and that my\r\nobject in mounting aloft was to get a nearer view of the stars,\r\nsupposing me, of course, to be short-sighted. A very silly conceit of\r\ntheirs, some may say, but not so silly after all; for surely the\r\nadvantage of getting nearer an object by two hundred feet is not to be\r\nunderrated. Then, to study the stars upon the wide, boundless sea, is\r\ndivine as it was to the Chaldean Magi, who observed their revolutions\r\nfrom the plains.\r\n\r\nAnd it is a very fine feeling, and one that fuses us into the universe\r\nof things, and mates us a part of the All, to think that, wherever we\r\nocean-wanderers rove, we have still the same glorious old stars to keep\r\nus company; that they still shine onward and on, forever beautiful and\r\nbright, and luring us, by every ray, to die and be glorified with them.\r\n\r\nAy, ay! we sailors sail not in vain, We expatriate ourselves to\r\nnationalise with the universe; and in all our voyages round the world,\r\nwe are still accompanied by those old circumnavigators, the stars, who\r\nare shipmates and fellow-sailors of ours—sailing in heaven’s blue, as\r\nwe on the azure main. Let genteel generations scoff at our hardened\r\nhands, and finger-nails tipped with tar—did they ever clasp truer palms\r\nthan ours? Let them feel of our sturdy hearts beating like\r\nsledge-hammers in those hot smithies, our bosoms; with their\r\namber-headed canes, let them feel of our generous pulses, and swear\r\nthat they go off like thirty-two-pounders.\r\n\r\nOh, give me again the rover’s life—the joy, the thrill, the whirl! Let\r\nme feel thee again, old sea! let me leap into thy saddle once more. I\r\nam sick of these terra firma toils and cares; sick of the dust and reek\r\nof towns. Let me hear the clatter of hailstones on icebergs, and not\r\nthe dull tramp of these plodders, plodding their dull way from their\r\ncradles to their graves. Let me snuff thee up, sea-breeze! and whinny\r\nin thy spray. Forbid it, sea-gods! intercede for me with Neptune, O\r\nsweet Amphitrite, that no dull clod may fall on my coffin! Be mine the\r\ntomb that swallowed up Pharaoh and all his hosts; let me lie down with\r\nDrake, where he sleeps in the sea.\r\n\r\nBut when White-Jacket speaks of the rover’s life, he means not life in\r\na man-of-war, which, with its martial formalities and thousand vices,\r\nstabs to the heart the soul of all free-and-easy honourable rovers.\r\n\r\nI have said that I was wont to mount up aloft and muse; and thus was it\r\nwith me the night following the loss of the cooper. Ere my watch in the\r\ntop had expired, high up on the main-royal-yard I reclined, the white\r\njacket folded around me like Sir John Moore in his frosted cloak.\r\n\r\nEight bells had struck, and my watchmates had hied to their hammocks,\r\nand the other watch had gone to their stations, and the _top_ below me\r\nwas full of strangers, and still one hundred feet above even _them_ I\r\nlay entranced; now dozing, now dreaming; now thinking of things past,\r\nand anon of the life to come. Well-timed was the latter thought, for\r\nthe life to come was much nearer overtaking me than I then could\r\nimagine. Perhaps I was half conscious at last of a tremulous voice\r\nhailing the main-royal-yard from the _top_. But if so, the\r\nconsciousness glided away from me, and left me in Lethe. But when, like\r\nlightning, the yard dropped under me, and instinctively I clung with\r\nboth hands to the “_tie_,” then I came to myself with a rush, and felt\r\nsomething like a choking hand at my throat. For an instant I thought\r\nthe Gulf Stream in my head was whirling me away to eternity; but the\r\nnext moment I found myself standing; the yard had descended to the\r\n_cup_; and shaking myself in my jacket, I felt that I was unharmed and\r\nalive.\r\n\r\nWho had done this? who had made this attempt on my life? thought I, as\r\nI ran down the rigging.\r\n\r\n“Here it comes!—Lord! Lord! here it comes! See, see! it is white as a\r\nhammock.”\r\n\r\n“Who’s coming?” I shouted, springing down into the top; “who’s white as\r\na hammock?”\r\n\r\n“Bless my soul, Bill it’s only White-Jacket—that infernal White-Jacket\r\nagain!”\r\n\r\nIt seems they had spied a moving white spot there aloft, and,\r\nsailor-like, had taken me for the ghost of the cooper; and after\r\nhailing me, and bidding me descend, to test my corporeality, and\r\ngetting no answer, they had lowered the halyards in affright.\r\n\r\nIn a rage I tore off the jacket, and threw it on the deck.\r\n\r\n“Jacket,” cried I, “you must change your complexion! you must hie to\r\nthe dyers and be dyed, that I may live. I have but one poor life,\r\nWhite-Jacket, and that life I cannot spare. I cannot consent to die for\r\n_you_, but be dyed you must for me. You can dye many times without\r\ninjury; but I cannot die without irreparable loss, and running the\r\neternal risk.”\r\n\r\nSo in the morning, jacket in hand, I repaired to the First Lieutenant,\r\nand related the narrow escape I had had during the night. I enlarged\r\nupon the general perils I ran in being taken for a ghost, and earnestly\r\nbesought him to relax his commands for once, and give me an order on\r\nBrush, the captain of the paint-room, for some black paint, that my\r\njacket might be painted of that colour.\r\n\r\n“Just look at it, sir,” I added, holding it lip; “did you ever see\r\nanything whiter? Consider how it shines of a night, like a bit of the\r\nMilky Way. A little paint, sir, you cannot refuse.”\r\n\r\n“The ship has no paint to spare,” he said; “you must get along without\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Sir, every rain gives me a soaking; Cape Horn is at hand—six\r\nbrushes-full would make it waterproof; and no longer would I be in\r\nperil of my life!”\r\n\r\n“Can’t help it, sir; depart!”\r\n\r\nI fear it will not be well with me in the end; for if my own sins are\r\nto be forgiven only as I forgive that hard-hearted and unimpressible\r\nFirst Lieutenant, then pardon there is none for me.\r\n\r\nWhat! when but one dab of paint would make a man of a ghost, and it\r\nMackintosh of a herring-net—to refuse it I am full. I can say no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\nHOW THEY SLEEP IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo more of my luckless jacket for a while; let me speak of my hammock,\r\nand the tribulations I endured therefrom.\r\n\r\nGive me plenty of room to swing it in; let me swing it between two\r\ndate-trees on an Arabian plain; or extend it diagonally from Moorish\r\npillar to pillar, in the open marble Court of the Lions in Granada’s\r\nAlhambra: let me swing it on a high bluff of the Mississippi—one swing\r\nin the pure ether for every swing over the green grass; or let me\r\noscillate in it beneath the cool dome of St. Peter’s; or drop me in it,\r\nas in a balloon, from the zenith, with the whole firmament to rock and\r\nexpatiate in; and I would not exchange my coarse canvas hammock for the\r\ngrand state-bed, like a stately coach-and-four, in which they tuck in a\r\nking when he passes a night at Blenheim Castle.\r\n\r\nWhen you have the requisite room, you always have “spreaders” in your\r\nhammock; that is, two horizontal sticks, one at each end, which serve\r\nto keep the sides apart, and create a wide vacancy between, wherein you\r\ncan turn over and over—lay on this side or that; on your back, if you\r\nplease; stretch out your legs; in short, take your ease in your\r\nhammock; for of all inns, your bed is the best.\r\n\r\nBut when, with five hundred other hammocks, yours is crowded and jammed\r\non all sides, on a frigate berth-deck; the third from above, when\r\n“_spreaders_” are prohibited by an express edict from the Captain’s\r\ncabin; and every man about you is jealously watchful of the rights and\r\nprivileges of his own proper hammock, as settled by law and usage;\r\n_then_ your hammock is your Bastile and canvas jug; into which, or out\r\nof which, it is very hard to get; and where sleep is but a mockery and\r\na name.\r\n\r\nEighteen inches a man is all they allow you; eighteen inches in width;\r\nin _that_ you must swing. Dreadful! they give you more swing than that\r\nat the gallows.\r\n\r\nDuring warm nights in the Tropics, your hammock is as a stew-pan; where\r\nyou stew and stew, till you can almost hear yourself hiss. Vain are all\r\nstratagems to widen your accommodations. Let them catch you insinuating\r\nyour boots or other articles in the head of your hammock, by way of a\r\n“spreader.” Near and far, the whole rank and file of the row to which\r\nyou belong feel the encroachment in an instant, and are clamorous till\r\nthe guilty one is found out, and his pallet brought back to its\r\nbearings.\r\n\r\nIn platoons and squadrons, they all lie on a level; their hammock\r\n_clews_ crossing and recrossing in all directions, so as to present one\r\nvast field-bed, midway between the ceiling and the floor; which are\r\nabout five feet asunder.\r\n\r\nOne extremely warm night, during a calm, when it was so hot that only a\r\nskeleton could keep cool (from the free current of air through its\r\nbones), after being drenched in my own perspiration, I managed to wedge\r\nmyself out of my hammock; and with what little strength I had left,\r\nlowered myself gently to the deck. Let me see now, thought I, whether\r\nmy ingenuity cannot devise some method whereby I can have room to\r\nbreathe and sleep at the same time. I have it. I will lower my hammock\r\nunderneath all these others; and then—upon that separate and\r\nindependent level, at least—I shall have the whole berth-deck to\r\nmyself. Accordingly, I lowered away my pallet to the desired\r\npoint—about three inches from the floor—and crawled into it again.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! this arrangement made such a sweeping semi-circle of my\r\nhammock, that, while my head and feet were at par, the small of my back\r\nwas settling down indefinitely; I felt as if some gigantic archer had\r\nhold of me for a bow.\r\n\r\nBut there was another plan left. I triced up my hammock with all my\r\nstrength, so as to bring it wholly _above_ the tiers of pallets around\r\nme. This done, by a last effort, I hoisted myself into it; but, alas!\r\nit was much worse than before. My luckless hammock was stiff and\r\nstraight as a board; and there I was—laid out in it, with my nose\r\nagainst the ceiling, like a dead man’s against the lid of his coffin.\r\n\r\nSo at last I was fain to return to my old level, and moralise upon the\r\nfolly, in all arbitrary governments, of striving to get either _below_\r\nor _above_ those whom legislation has placed upon an equality with\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of hammocks, recalls a circumstance that happened one night in\r\nthe Neversink. It was three or four times repeated, with various but\r\nnot fatal results.\r\n\r\nThe watch below was fast asleep on the berth-deck, where perfect\r\nsilence was reigning, when a sudden shock and a groan roused up all\r\nhands; and the hem of a pair of white trowsers vanished up one of the\r\nladders at the fore-hatchway.\r\n\r\nWe ran toward the groan, and found a man lying on the deck; one end of\r\nhis hammock having given way, pitching his head close to three\r\ntwenty-four pound cannon shot, which must have been purposely placed in\r\nthat position. When it was discovered that this man had long been\r\nsuspected of being an _informer_ among the crew, little surprise and\r\nless pleasure were evinced at his narrow escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nONE REASON WHY MEN-OF-WAR’S MEN ARE, GENERALLY, SHORT-LIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot quit this matter of the hammocks without making mention of a\r\ngrievance among the sailors that ought to be redressed.\r\n\r\nIn a man-of-war at sea, the sailors have _watch and watch;_ that is,\r\nthrough every twenty-four hours, they are on and off duty every four\r\nhours. Now, the hammocks are piped down from the nettings (the open\r\nspace for stowing them, running round the top of the bulwarks) a little\r\nafter sunset, and piped up again when the forenoon watch is called, at\r\neight o’clock in the morning; so that during the daytime they are\r\ninaccessible as pallets. This would be all well enough, did the sailors\r\nhave a complete night’s rest; but every other night at sea, one watch\r\nhave only four hours in their hammocks. Indeed, deducting the time\r\nallowed for the other watch to turn out; for yourself to arrange your\r\nhammock, get into it, and fairly get asleep; it maybe said that, every\r\nother night, you have but three hours’ sleep in your hammock. Having\r\nthen been on deck for twice four hours, at eight o’clock in the morning\r\nyour _watch-below_ comes round, and you are not liable to duty until\r\nnoon. Under like circumstances, a merchant seaman goes to his _bunk_,\r\nand has the benefit of a good long sleep. But in a man-of-war you can\r\ndo no such thing; your hammock is very neatly stowed in the nettings,\r\nand there it must remain till nightfall.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps there is a corner for you somewhere along the batteries on\r\nthe gun-deck, where you may enjoy a snug nap. But as no one is allowed\r\nto recline on the larboard side of the gun-deck (which is reserved as a\r\ncorridor for the officers when they go forward to their smoking-room at\r\nthe _bridle-port_), the starboard side only is left to the seaman. But\r\nmost of this side, also, is occupied by the carpenters, sail-makers,\r\nbarbers, and coopers. In short, so few are the corners where you can\r\nsnatch a nap during daytime in a frigate, that not one in ten of the\r\nwatch, who have been on deck eight hours, can get a wink of sleep till\r\nthe following night. Repeatedly, after by good fortune securing a\r\ncorner, I have been roused from it by some functionary commissioned to\r\nkeep it clear.\r\n\r\nOff Cape Horn, what before had been very uncomfortable became a serious\r\nhardship. Drenched through and through by the spray of the sea at\r\nnight. I have sometimes slept standing on the spar-deck—and shuddered\r\nas I slept—for the want of sufficient sleep in my hammock.\r\n\r\nDuring three days of the stormiest weather, we were given the privilege\r\nof the _berth-deck_ (at other times strictly interdicted), where we\r\nwere permitted to spread our jackets, and take a nap in the morning\r\nafter the eight hours’ night exposure. But this privilege was but a\r\nbeggarly one, indeed. Not to speak of our jackets—used for\r\nblankets—being soaking wet, the spray, coming down the hatchways, kept\r\nthe planks of the berth-deck itself constantly wet; whereas, had we\r\nbeen permitted our hammocks, we might have swung dry over all this\r\ndeluge. But we endeavoured to make ourselves as warm and comfortable as\r\npossible, chiefly by close stowing, so as to generate a little steam,\r\nin the absence of any fire-side warmth. You have seen, perhaps, the way\r\nin which they box up subjects intended to illustrate the winter\r\nlectures of a professor of surgery. Just so we laid; heel and point,\r\nface to back, dove-tailed into each other at every ham and knee. The\r\nwet of our jackets, thus densely packed, would soon begin to distill.\r\nBut it was like pouring hot water on you to keep you from freezing. It\r\nwas like being “packed” between the soaked sheets in a Water-cure\r\nEstablishment.\r\n\r\nSuch a posture could not be preserved for any considerable period\r\nwithout shifting side for side. Three or four times during the four\r\nhours I would be startled from a wet doze by the hoarse cry of a fellow\r\nwho did the duty of a corporal at the after-end of my file. “_Sleepers\r\nahoy! stand by to slew round!_” and, with a double shuffle, we all\r\nrolled in concert, and found ourselves facing the taffrail instead of\r\nthe bowsprit. But, however you turned, your nose was sure to stick to\r\none or other of the steaming backs on your two flanks. There was some\r\nlittle relief in the change of odour consequent upon this.\r\n\r\nBut what is the reason that, after battling out eight stormy hours on\r\ndeck at, night, men-of-war’s-men are not allowed the poor boon of a dry\r\nfour hours’ nap during the day following? What is the reason? The\r\nCommodore, Captain, and first Lieutenant, Chaplain, Purser, and scores\r\nof others, have _all night in_, just as if they were staying at a hotel\r\non shore. And the junior Lieutenants not only have their cots to go to\r\nat any time: but as only one of them is required to head the watch, and\r\nthere are so many of them among whom to divide that duty, they are only\r\non deck four hours to twelve hours below. In some eases the proportion\r\nis still greater. Whereas, with _the people_ it is four hours in and\r\nfour hours off continually.\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason, then, that the common seamen should fare so hard in\r\nthis matter? It would seem but a simple thing to let them get down\r\ntheir hammocks during the day for a nap. But no; such a proceeding\r\nwould mar the uniformity of daily events in a man-of-war. It seems\r\nindispensable to the picturesque effect of the spar-deck, that the\r\nhammocks should invariably remain stowed in the nettings between\r\nsunrise and sundown. But the chief reason is this—a reason which has\r\nsanctioned many an abuse in this world—_precedents are against it;_\r\nsuch a thing as sailors sleeping in their hammocks in the daytime,\r\nafter being eight hours exposed to a night-storm, was hardly ever heard\r\nof in the navy. Though, to the immortal honour of some captains be it\r\nsaid, the fact is upon navy record, that off Cape Horn, they _have_\r\nvouchsafed the morning hammocks to their crew. Heaven bless such\r\ntender-hearted officers; and may they and their descendants—ashore or\r\nafloat—have sweet and pleasant slumbers while they live, and an\r\nundreaming siesta when they die.\r\n\r\nIt is concerning such things as the subject of this chapter that\r\nspecial enactments of Congress are demanded. Health and comfort—so far\r\nas duly attainable under the circumstances—should be legally guaranteed\r\nto the man-of-war’s-men; and not left to the discretion or caprice of\r\ntheir commanders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nWASH-DAY AND HOUSE-CLEANING IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides the other tribulations connected with your hammock, you must\r\nkeep it snow-white and clean; who has not observed the long rows of\r\nspotless hammocks exposed in a frigate’s nettings, where, through the\r\nday, their outsides, at least, are kept airing?\r\n\r\nHence it comes that there are regular mornings appointed for the\r\nscrubbing of hammocks; and such mornings are called\r\n_scrub-hammock-mornings;_ and desperate is the scrubbing that ensues.\r\n\r\nBefore daylight the operation begins. All hands are called, and at it\r\nthey go. Every deck is spread with hammocks, fore and aft; and lucky\r\nare you if you can get sufficient superfices to spread your own hammock\r\nin. Down on their knees are five hundred men, scrubbing away with\r\nbrushes and brooms; jostling, and crowding, and quarrelling about using\r\neach other’s suds; when all their Purser’s soap goes to create one\r\nindiscriminate yeast.\r\n\r\nSometimes you discover that, in the dark, you have been all the while\r\nscrubbing your next neighbour’s hammock instead of your own. But it is\r\ntoo late to begin over again; for now the word is passed for every man\r\nto advance with his hammock, that it may be tied to a net-like\r\nframe-work of clothes-lines, and hoisted aloft to dry.\r\n\r\nThat done, without delay you get together your frocks and trowsers, and\r\non the already flooded deck embark in the laundry business. You have no\r\nspecial bucket or basin to yourself—the ship being one vast wash-tub,\r\nwhere all hands wash and rinse out, and rinse out and wash, till at\r\nlast the word is passed again, to make fast your clothes, that they,\r\nalso, may be elevated to dry.\r\n\r\nThen on all three decks the operation of holy-stoning begins, so called\r\nfrom the queer name bestowed upon the principal instruments employed.\r\nThese are ponderous flat stones with long ropes at each end, by which\r\nthe stones are slidden about, to and fro, over the wet and sanded\r\ndecks; a most wearisome, dog-like, galley-slave employment. For the\r\nbyways and corners about the masts and guns, smaller stones are used,\r\ncalled _prayer-books;_ inasmuch as the devout operator has to down with\r\nthem on his knees.\r\n\r\nFinally, a grand flooding takes place, and the decks are remorselessly\r\nthrashed with dry swabs. After which an extraordinary implement—a sort\r\nof leathern hoe called a “_squilgee_”—is used to scrape and squeeze the\r\nlast dribblings of water from the planks. Concerning this “squilgee,” I\r\nthink something of drawing up a memoir, and reading it before the\r\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences. It is a most curious affair.\r\n\r\nBy the time all these operations are concluded it is _eight bell’s_,\r\nand all hands are piped to breakfast upon the damp and every-way\r\ndisagreeable decks.\r\n\r\nNow, against this invariable daily flooding of the three decks of a\r\nfrigate, as a man-of-war’s-man, White-Jacket most earnestly protests.\r\nIn sunless weather it keeps the sailors’ quarters perpetually damp; so\r\nmuch so, that you can scarce sit down without running the risk of\r\ngetting the lumbago. One rheumatic old sheet-anchor-man among us was\r\ndriven to the extremity of sewing a piece of tarred canvas on the seat\r\nof his trowsers.\r\n\r\nLet those neat and tidy officers who so love to see a ship kept spick\r\nand span clean; who institute vigorous search after the man who chances\r\nto drop the crumb of a biscuit on deck, when the ship is rolling in a\r\nsea-way; let all such swing their hammocks with the sailors; and they\r\nwould soon get sick of this daily damping of the decks.\r\n\r\nIs a ship a wooden platter, that is to be scrubbed out every morning\r\nbefore breakfast, even if the thermometer be at zero, and every sailor\r\ngoes barefooted through the flood with the chilblains? And all the\r\nwhile the ship carries a doctor, well aware of Boerhaave’s great maxim\r\n“_keep the feet dry_.” He has plenty of pills to give you when you are\r\ndown with a fever, the consequence of these things; but enters no\r\nprotest at the outset—as it is his duty to do—against the cause that\r\ninduces the fever.\r\n\r\nDuring the pleasant night watches, the promenading officers, mounted on\r\ntheir high-heeled boots, pass dry-shod, like the Israelites, over the\r\ndecks; but by daybreak the roaring tide sets back, and the poor sailors\r\nare almost overwhelmed in it, like the Egyptians in the Red Sea.\r\n\r\nOh! the chills, colds, and agues that are caught. No snug stove, grate,\r\nor fireplace to go to; no, your only way to keep warm is to keep in a\r\nblazing passion, and anathematise the custom that every morning makes a\r\nwash-house of a man-of-war.\r\n\r\nLook at it. Say you go on board a line-of-battle-ship: you see\r\neverything scrupulously neat; you see all the decks clear and\r\nunobstructed as the sidewalks of Wall Street of a Sunday morning; you\r\nsee no trace of a sailor’s dormitory; you marvel by what magic all this\r\nis brought about. And well you may. For consider, that in this\r\nunobstructed fabric nearly one thousand mortal men have to sleep, eat,\r\nwash, dress, cook, and perform all the ordinary functions of humanity.\r\nThe same number of men ashore would expand themselves into a township.\r\nIs it credible, then, that this extraordinary neatness, and especially\r\nthis _unobstructedness_ of a man-of-war, can be brought about, except\r\nby the most rigorous edicts, and a very serious sacrifice, with respect\r\nto the sailors, of the domestic comforts of life? To be sure, sailors\r\nthemselves do not often complain of these things; they are used to\r\nthem; but man can become used even to the hardest usage. And it is\r\nbecause he is used to it, that sometimes he does not complain of it.\r\n\r\nOf all men-of-war, the American ships are the most excessively neat,\r\nand have the greatest reputation for it. And of all men-of-war the\r\ngeneral discipline of the American ships is the most arbitrary.\r\n\r\nIn the English navy, the men liberally mess on tables, which, between\r\nmeals, are triced up out of the way. The American sailors mess on deck,\r\nand pick up their broken biscuit, or _midshipman’s nuts_, like fowls in\r\na barn-yard.\r\n\r\nBut if this unobstructedness in an American fighting-ship be, at all\r\nhazards, so desirable, why not imitate the Turks? In the Turkish navy\r\nthey have no mess-chests; the sailors roll their mess things up in a\r\nrug, and thrust them under a gun. Nor do they have any hammocks; they\r\nsleep anywhere about the decks in their _gregoes_. Indeed, come to look\r\nat it, what more does a man-of-war’s-man absolutely require to live in\r\nthan his own skin? That’s room enough; and room enough to turn in, if\r\nhe but knew how to shift his spine, end for end, like a ramrod, without\r\ndisturbing his next neighbour.\r\n\r\nAmong all men-of-war’s-men, it is a maxim that over-neat vessels are\r\nTartars to the crew: and perhaps it may be safely laid down that, when\r\nyou see such a ship, some sort of tyranny is not very far off.\r\n\r\nIn the Neversink, as in other national ships, the business of\r\n_holy-stoning_ the decks was often prolonged, by way of punishment to\r\nthe men, particularly of a raw, cold morning. This is one of the\r\npunishments which a lieutenant of the watch may easily inflict upon the\r\ncrew, without infringing the statute which places the power of\r\npunishment solely in the hands of the Captain.\r\n\r\nThe abhorrence which men-of-war’s-men have for this protracted\r\n_holy-stoning_ in cold, comfortless weather—with their bare feet\r\nexposed to the splashing inundations—is shown in a strange story, rife\r\namong them, curiously tinctured with their proverbial superstitions.\r\n\r\nThe First Lieutenant of an English sloop of war, a severe\r\ndisciplinarian, was uncommonly particular concerning the whiteness of\r\nthe quarter-deck. One bitter winter morning at sea, when the crew had\r\nwashed that part of the vessel, as usual, and put away their\r\nholy-stones, this officer came on deck, and after inspecting it,\r\nordered the _holy-stones_ and _prayer-books_ up again. Once more\r\nslipping off the shoes from their frosted feet, and rolling up their\r\ntrowsers, the crew kneeled down to their task; and in that suppliant\r\nposture, silently invoked a curse upon their tyrant; praying, as he\r\nwent below, that he might never more come out of the ward-room alive.\r\nThe prayer seemed answered: for shortly after being visited with a\r\nparalytic stroke at his breakfast-table, the First Lieutenant next\r\nmorning was carried out of the ward-room feet foremost, dead. As they\r\ndropped him over the side—so goes the story—the marine sentry at the\r\ngangway turned his back upon the corpse.\r\n\r\nTo the credit of the humane and sensible portion of the roll of\r\nAmerican navy-captains, be it added, that _they_ are not so particular\r\nin keeping the decks spotless at all times, and in all weathers; nor do\r\nthey torment the men with scraping bright-wood and polishing\r\nring-bolts; but give all such gingerbread-work a hearty coat of black\r\npaint, which looks more warlike, is a better preservative, and exempts\r\nthe sailors from a perpetual annoyance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nTHEATRICALS IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Neversink had summered out her last Christmas on the Equator; she\r\nwas now destined to winter out the Fourth of July not very far from the\r\nfrigid latitudes of Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes the custom in the American Navy to celebrate this\r\nnational holiday by doubling the allowance of spirits to the men; that\r\nis, if the ship happen to be lying in harbour. The effects of this\r\npatriotic plan may be easily imagined: the whole ship is converted into\r\na dram-shop; and the intoxicated sailors reel about, on all three\r\ndecks, singing, howling, and fighting. This is the time that, owing to\r\nthe relaxed discipline of the ship, old and almost forgotten quarrels\r\nare revived, under the stimulus of drink; and, fencing themselves up\r\nbetween the guns—so as to be sure of a clear space with at least three\r\nwalls—the combatants, two and two, fight out their hate, cribbed and\r\ncabined like soldiers duelling in a sentry-box. In a word, scenes ensue\r\nwhich would not for a single instant be tolerated by the officers upon\r\nany other occasion. This is the time that the most venerable of\r\nquarter-gunners and quarter-masters, together with the smallest\r\napprentice boys, and men never known to have been previously\r\nintoxicated during the cruise—this is the time that they all roll\r\ntogether in the same muddy trough of drunkenness.\r\n\r\nIn emulation of the potentates of the Middle Ages, some Captains\r\naugment the din by authorising a grand jail-delivery of all the\r\nprisoners who, on that auspicious Fourth of the month, may happen to be\r\nconfined in the ship’s prison—“_the brig_.”\r\n\r\nBut from scenes like these the Neversink was happily delivered. Besides\r\nthat she was now approaching a most perilous part of the ocean—which\r\nwould have made it madness to intoxicate the sailors—her complete\r\ndestitution of _grog_, even for ordinary consumption, was an obstacle\r\naltogether insuperable, even had the Captain felt disposed to indulge\r\nhis man-of-war’s-men by the most copious libations.\r\n\r\nFor several days previous to the advent of the holiday, frequent\r\nconferences were held on the gun-deck touching the melancholy prospects\r\nbefore the ship.\r\n\r\n“Too bad—too bad!” cried a top-man, “Think of it, shipmates—a Fourth of\r\nJuly without grog!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll hoist the Commodore’s pennant at half-mast that day,” sighed the\r\nsignal-quarter-master.\r\n\r\n“And I’ll turn my best uniform jacket wrong side out, to keep company\r\nwith the pennant, old Ensign,” sympathetically responded an\r\nafter-guard’s-man.\r\n\r\n“Ay, do!” cried a forecastle-man. “I could almost pipe my eye to think\r\non’t.”\r\n\r\n“No grog on de day dat tried men’s souls!” blubbered Sunshine, the\r\ngalley-cook.\r\n\r\n“Who would be a _Jankee_ now?” roared a Hollander of the fore-top, more\r\nDutch than sour-crout.\r\n\r\n“Is this the _riglar_ fruits of liberty?” touchingly inquired an Irish\r\nwaister of an old Spanish sheet-anchor-man.\r\n\r\nYou will generally observe that, of all Americans, your foreign-born\r\ncitizens are the most patriotic—especially toward the Fourth of July.\r\n\r\nBut how could Captain Claret, the father of his crew, behold the grief\r\nof his ocean children with indifference? He could not. Three days\r\nbefore the anniversary—it still continuing very pleasant weather for\r\nthese latitudes—it was publicly announced that free permission was\r\ngiven to the sailors to get up any sort of theatricals they desired,\r\nwherewith to honour the Fourth.\r\n\r\nNow, some weeks prior to the Neversink’s sailing from home—nearly three\r\nyears before the time here spoken of—some of the seamen had clubbed\r\ntogether, and made up a considerable purse, for the purpose of\r\npurchasing a theatrical outfit having in view to diversify the monotony\r\nof lying in foreign harbours for weeks together, by an occasional\r\ndisplay on the boards—though if ever there w-as a continual theatre in\r\nthe world, playing by night and by day, and without intervals between\r\nthe acts, a man-of-war is that theatre, and her planks are the _boards_\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\nThe sailors who originated this scheme had served in other American\r\nfrigates, where the privilege of having theatricals was allowed to the\r\ncrew. What was their chagrin, then, when, upon making an application to\r\nthe Captain, in a Peruvian harbour, for permission to present the\r\nmuch-admired drama of “_The Ruffian Boy_,” under the Captain’s personal\r\npatronage, that dignitary assured them that there were already enough\r\n_ruffian boys_ on board, without conjuring up any more from the\r\ngreen-room.\r\n\r\nThe theatrical outfit, therefore, was stowed down in the bottom of the\r\nsailors’ bags, who little anticipated _then_ that it would ever be\r\ndragged out while Captain Claret had the sway.\r\n\r\nBut immediately upon the announcement that the embargo was removed,\r\nvigorous preparations were at once commenced to celebrate the Fourth\r\nwith unwonted spirit. The half-deck was set apart for the theatre, and\r\nthe signal-quarter-master was commanded to loan his flags to decorate\r\nit in the most patriotic style.\r\n\r\nAs the stage-struck portion of the crew had frequently during the\r\ncruise rehearsed portions of various plays, to while away the tedium of\r\nthe night-watches, they needed no long time now to perfect themselves\r\nin their parts.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on the very next morning after the indulgence had been\r\ngranted by the Captain, the following written placard, presenting a\r\nbroadside of staring capitals, was found tacked against the main-mast\r\non the gun-deck. It was as if a Drury-Lane bill had been posted upon\r\nthe London Monument.\r\n\r\n                   CAPE HORN THEATRE. *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *\r\n                   _Grand Celebration of the Fourth of July_.

True Yankee Sailor (in\r\n                  costume), Patrick Flinegan, Captain of the Head.\r\n   Performance to commence with “Hail Columbia,” by the Brass Band.\r\n   Ensign rises at three bells, P.M. No sailor permitted to enter in\r\n   his shirt-sleeves. Good order is expected to be maintained. The\r\n   Master-at-arms and Ship’s Corporals to be in attendance to keep the\r\n   peace.\r\n\r\nAt the earnest entreaties of the seamen, Lemsford, the gun-deck poet,\r\nhad been prevailed upon to draw up this bill. And upon this one\r\noccasion his literary abilities were far from being underrated, even by\r\nthe least intellectual person on board. Nor must it be omitted that,\r\nbefore the bill was placarded, Captain Claret, enacting the part of\r\ncensor and grand chamberlain ran over a manuscript copy of “_The Old\r\nWagon Paid Off_,” to see whether it contained anything calculated to\r\nbreed disaffection against lawful authority among the crew. He objected\r\nto some parts, but in the end let them all pass.\r\n\r\nThe morning of The Fourth—most anxiously awaited—dawned clear and fair.\r\nThe breeze was steady; the air bracing cold; and one and all the\r\nsailors anticipated a gleeful afternoon. And thus was falsified the\r\nprophecies of certain old growlers averse to theatricals, who had\r\npredicted a gale of wind that would squash all the arrangements of the\r\ngreen-room.\r\n\r\nAs the men whose regular turns, at the time of the performance, would\r\ncome round to be stationed in the tops, and at the various halyards and\r\nrunning ropes about the spar-deck, could not be permitted to partake in\r\nthe celebration, there accordingly ensued, during the morning, many\r\namusing scenes of tars who were anxious to procure substitutes at their\r\nposts. Through the day, many anxious glances were cast to windward; but\r\nthe weather still promised fair.\r\n\r\nAt last _the people_ were piped to dinner; two bells struck; and soon\r\nafter, all who could be spared from their stations hurried to the\r\nhalf-deck. The capstan bars were placed on shot-boxes, as at prayers on\r\nSundays, furnishing seats for the audience, while a low stage, rigged\r\nby the carpenter’s gang, was built at one end of the open space. The\r\ncurtain was composed of a large ensign, and the bulwarks round about\r\nwere draperied with the flags of all nations. The ten or twelve members\r\nof the brass band were ranged in a row at the foot of the stage, their\r\npolished instruments in their hands, while the consequential Captain of\r\nthe Band himself was elevated upon a gun carriage.\r\n\r\nAt three bells precisely a group of ward-room officers emerged from the\r\nafter-hatchway, and seated themselves upon camp-stools, in a central\r\nposition, with the stars and stripes for a canopy. _That_ was the royal\r\nbox. The sailors looked round for the Commodore but neither Commodore\r\nnor Captain honored _the people_ with their presence.\r\n\r\nAt the call of a bugle the band struck up _Hail Columbia_, the whole\r\naudience keeping time, as at Drury Lane, when _God Save The King_ is\r\nplayed after a great national victory.\r\n\r\nAt the discharge of a marine’s musket the curtain rose, and four\r\nsailors, in the picturesque garb of Maltese mariners, staggered on the\r\nstage in a feigned state of intoxication. The truthfulness of the\r\nrepresentation was much heightened by the roll of the ship.\r\n\r\n“The Commodore,” “Old Luff,” “The Mayor,” and “Gin and Sugar Sall,”\r\nwere played to admiration, and received great applause. But at the\r\nfirst appearance of that universal favourite, Jack Chase, in the\r\nchivalric character of _Percy Royal-Mast_, the whole audience\r\nsimultaneously rose to their feet, and greeted hire with three hearty\r\ncheers, that almost took the main-top-sail aback.\r\n\r\nMatchless Jack, _in full fig_, bowed again and again, with true\r\nquarter-deck grace and self possession; and when five or six untwisted\r\nstrands of rope and bunches of oakum were thrown to him, as substitutes\r\nfor bouquets, he took them one by one, and gallantly hung them from the\r\nbuttons of his jacket.\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!—go on! go on!—stop hollering—hurrah!—go\r\non!—stop hollering—hurrah!” was now heard on all sides, till at last,\r\nseeing no end to the enthusiasm of his ardent admirers, Matchless Jack\r\nstepped forward, and, with his lips moving in pantomime, plunged into\r\nthe thick of the part. Silence soon followed, but was fifty times\r\nbroken by uncontrollable bursts of applause. At length, when that\r\nheart-thrilling scene came on, where Percy Royal-Mast rescues fifteen\r\noppressed sailors from the watch-house, in the teeth of a posse of\r\nconstables, the audience leaped to their feet, overturned the capstan\r\nbars, and to a man hurled their hats on the stage in a delirium of\r\ndelight. Ah Jack, that was a ten-stroke indeed!\r\n\r\nThe commotion was now terrific; all discipline seemed gone for ever;\r\nthe Lieutenants ran in among the men, the Captain darted from his\r\ncabin, and the Commodore nervously questioned the armed sentry at his\r\ndoor as to what the deuce _the people_ were about. In the midst of all\r\nthis, the trumpet of the officer-of-the-deck, commanding the\r\ntop-gallant sails to be taken in, was almost completely drowned. A\r\nblack squall was coming down on the weather-bow, and the boat-swain’s\r\nmates bellowed themselves hoarse at the main-hatchway. There is no\r\nknowing what would have ensued, had not the bass drum suddenly been\r\nheard, calling all hands to quarters, a summons not to be withstood.\r\nThe sailors pricked their ears at it, as horses at the sound of a\r\ncracking whip, and confusedly stumbled up the ladders to their\r\nstations. The next moment all was silent but the wind, howling like a\r\nthousand devils in the cordage.\r\n\r\n“Stand by to reef all three top-sails!—settle away the halyards!—haul\r\nout—so: make fast!—aloft, top-men! and reef away!”\r\n\r\nThus, in storm and tempest terminated that day’s theatricals. But the\r\nsailors never recovered from the disappointment of not having the\r\n“_True Yankee Sailor_” sung by the Irish Captain of the Head.\r\n\r\nAnd here White-jacket must moralize a bit. The unwonted spectacle of\r\nthe row of gun-room officers mingling with “the people” in applauding a\r\nmere seaman like Jack Chase, filled me at the time with the most\r\npleasurable emotions. It is a sweet thing, thought I, to see these\r\nofficers confess a human brotherhood with us, after all; a sweet thing\r\nto mark their cordial appreciation of the manly merits of my matchless\r\nJack. Ah! they are noble fellows all round, and I do not know but I\r\nhave wronged them sometimes in my thoughts.\r\n\r\nNor was it without similar pleasurable feelings that I witnessed the\r\ntemporary rupture of the ship’s stern discipline, consequent upon the\r\ntumult of the theatricals. I thought to myself, this now is as it\r\nshould be. It is good to shake off, now and then, this iron yoke round\r\nour necks. And after having once permitted us sailors to be a little\r\nnoisy, in a harmless way—somewhat merrily turbulent—the officers\r\ncannot, with any good grace, be so excessively stern and unyielding as\r\nbefore. I began to think a man-of-war a man-of-peace-and-good-will,\r\nafter all. But, alas! disappointment came.\r\n\r\nNext morning the same old scene was enacted at the gang-way. And\r\nbeholding the row of uncompromising-looking-officers there assembled\r\nwith the Captain, to witness punishment—the same officers who had been\r\nso cheerfully disposed over night—an old sailor touched my shoulder and\r\nsaid, “See, White-Jacket, all round they have _shipped their\r\nquarter-deck faces again_. But this is the way.”\r\n\r\nI afterward learned that this was an old man-of-war’s-man’s phrase,\r\nexpressive of the facility with which a sea-officer falls back upon all\r\nthe severity of his dignity, after a temporary suspension of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\nINTRODUCTORY TO CAPE HORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, through drizzling fogs and vapours, and under damp,\r\ndouble-reefed top-sails, our wet-decked frigate drew nearer and nearer\r\nto the squally Cape.\r\n\r\nWho has not heard of it? Cape Horn, Cape Horn—a _horn_ indeed, that has\r\ntossed many a good ship. Was the descent of Orpheus, Ulysses, or Dante\r\ninto Hell, one whit more hardy and sublime than the first navigator’s\r\nweathering of that terrible Cape?\r\n\r\nTurned on her heel by a fierce West Wind, many an outward-bound ship\r\nhas been driven across the Southern Ocean to the Cape of Good\r\nHope—_that_ way to seek a passage to the Pacific. And that stormy Cape,\r\nI doubt not, has sent many a fine craft to the bottom, and told no\r\ntales. At those ends of the earth are no chronicles. What signify the\r\nbroken spars and shrouds that, day after day, are driven before the\r\nprows of more fortunate vessels? or the tall masts, imbedded in\r\nicebergs, that are found floating by? They but hint the old story—of\r\nships that have sailed from their ports, and never more have been heard\r\nof.\r\n\r\nImpracticable Cape! You may approach it from this direction or that—in\r\nany way you please—from the East or from the West; with the wind\r\nastern, or abeam, or on the quarter; and still Cape Horn is Cape Horn.\r\nCape Horn it is that takes the conceit out of fresh-water sailors, and\r\nsteeps in a still salter brine the saltest. Woe betide the tyro; the\r\nfool-hardy, Heaven preserve!\r\n\r\nYour Mediterranean captain, who with a cargo of oranges has hitherto\r\nmade merry runs across the Atlantic, without so much as furling a\r\nt’-gallant-sail, oftentimes, off Cape Horn, receives a lesson which he\r\ncarries to the grave; though the grave—as is too often the case—follows\r\nso hard on the lesson that no benefit comes from the experience.\r\n\r\nOther strangers who draw nigh to this Patagonia termination of our\r\nContinent, with their souls full of its shipwrecks and\r\ndisasters—top-sails cautiously reefed, and everything guardedly\r\nsnug—these strangers at first unexpectedly encountering a tolerably\r\nsmooth sea, rashly conclude that the Cape, after all, is but a bugbear;\r\nthey have been imposed upon by fables, and founderings and sinkings\r\nhereabouts are all cock-and-bull stories.\r\n\r\n“Out reefs, my hearties; fore and aft set t’-gallant-sails! stand by to\r\ngive her the fore-top-mast stun’-sail!”\r\n\r\nBut, Captain Rash, those sails of yours were much safer in the\r\nsail-maker’s loft. For now, while the heedless craft is bounding over\r\nthe billows, a black cloud rises out of the sea; the sun drops down\r\nfrom the sky; a horrible mist far and wide spreads over the water.\r\n\r\n“Hands by the halyards! Let go! Clew up!”\r\n\r\nToo late.\r\n\r\nFor ere the ropes’ ends can be the east off from the pins, the tornado\r\nis blowing down to the bottom of their throats. The masts are willows,\r\nthe sails ribbons, the cordage wool; the whole ship is brewed into the\r\nyeast of the gale.\r\n\r\nAn now, if, when the first green sea breaks over him, Captain Rash is\r\nnot swept overboard, he has his hands full be sure. In all probability\r\nhis three masts have gone by the board, and, ravelled into list, his\r\nsails are floating in the air. Or, perhaps, the ship _broaches to_, or\r\nis _brought by the lee_. In either ease, Heaven help the sailors, their\r\nwives and their little ones; and heaven help the underwriters.\r\n\r\nFamiliarity with danger makes a brave man braver, but less daring. Thus\r\nwith seamen: he who goes the oftenest round Cape Horn goes the most\r\ncircumspectly. A veteran mariner is never deceived by the treacherous\r\nbreezes which sometimes waft him pleasantly toward the latitude of the\r\nCape. No sooner does he come within a certain distance of it—previously\r\nfixed in his own mind—than all hands are turned to setting the ship in\r\nstorm-trim; and never mind how light the breeze, down come his\r\nt’-gallant-yards. He “bends” his strongest storm-sails, and lashes\r\nevery-thing on deck securely. The ship is then ready for the worst; and\r\nif, in reeling round the headland, she receives a broadside, it\r\ngenerally goes well with her. If ill, all hands go to the bottom with\r\nquiet consciences.\r\n\r\nAmong sea-captains, there are some who seem to regard the genius of the\r\nCape as a wilful, capricious jade, that must be courted and coaxed into\r\ncomplaisance. First, they come along under easy sails; do not steer\r\nboldly for the headland, but tack this way and that—sidling up to it,\r\nNow they woo the Jezebel with a t’-gallant-studding-sail; anon, they\r\ndeprecate her wrath with double-reefed-topsails. When, at length, her\r\nunappeasable fury is fairly aroused, and all round the dismantled ship\r\nthe storm howls and howls for days together, they still persevere in\r\ntheir efforts. First, they try unconditional submission; furling every\r\nrag and _heaving to_: laying like a log, for the tempest to toss\r\nwheresoever it pleases.\r\n\r\nThis failing, they set a _spencer_ or _try-sail_, and shift on the\r\nother tack. Equally vain! The gale sings as hoarsely as before. At\r\nlast, the wind comes round fair; they drop the fore-sail; square the\r\nyards, and scud before it; their implacable foe chasing them with\r\ntornadoes, as if to show her insensibility to the last.\r\n\r\nOther ships, without encountering these terrible gales, spend week\r\nafter week endeavouring to turn this boisterous world-corner against a\r\ncontinual head-wind. Tacking hither and thither, in the language of\r\nsailors they _polish_ the Cape by beating about its edges so long.\r\n\r\nLe Mair and Schouten, two Dutchmen, were the first navigators who\r\nweathered Cape Horn. Previous to this, passages had been made to the\r\nPacific by the Straits of Magellan; nor, indeed, at that period, was it\r\nknown to a certainty that there was any other route, or that the land\r\nnow called Terra del Fuego was an island. A few leagues southward from\r\nTerra del Fuego is a cluster of small islands, the Diegoes; between\r\nwhich and the former island are the Straits of Le Mair, so called in\r\nhonour of their discoverer, who first sailed through them into the\r\nPacific. Le Mair and Schouten, in their small, clumsy vessels,\r\nencountered a series of tremendous gales, the prelude to the long train\r\nof similar hardships which most of their followers have experienced. It\r\nis a significant fact, that Schouten’s vessel, the _Horne_, which gave\r\nits name to the Cape, was almost lost in weathering it.\r\n\r\nThe next navigator round the Cape was Sir Francis Drake, who, on\r\nRaleigh’s Expedition, beholding for the first time, from the Isthmus of\r\nDarien, the “goodlie South Sea,” like a true-born Englishman, vowed,\r\nplease God, to sail an English ship thereon; which the gallant sailor\r\ndid, to the sore discomfiture of the Spaniards on the coasts of Chili\r\nand Peru.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the greatest hardships on record, in making this celebrated\r\npassage, were those experienced by Lord Anson’s squadron in 1736. Three\r\nremarkable and most interesting narratives record their disasters and\r\nsufferings. The first, jointly written by the carpenter and gunner of\r\nthe Wager; the second by young Byron, a midshipman in the same ship;\r\nthe third, by the chaplain of the Centurion. White-Jacket has them all;\r\nand they are fine reading of a boisterous March night, with the\r\ncasement rattling in your ear, and the chimney-stacks blowing down upon\r\nthe pavement, bubbling with rain-drops.\r\n\r\nBut if you want the best idea of Cape Horn, get my friend Dana’s\r\nunmatchable “Two Years Before the Mast.” But you can read, and so you\r\nmust have read it. His chapters describing Cape Horn must have been\r\nwritten with an icicle.\r\n\r\nAt the present day the horrors of the Cape have somewhat abated. This\r\nis owing to a growing familiarity with it; but, more than all, to the\r\nimproved condition of ships in all respects, and the means now\r\ngenerally in use of preserving the health of the crews in times of\r\nsevere and prolonged exposure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nTHE DOG-DAYS OFF CAPE HORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nColder and colder; we are drawing nigh to the Cape. Now gregoes, pea\r\njackets, monkey jackets reefing jackets, storm jackets, oil jackets,\r\npaint jackets, round jackets short jackets, long jackets, and all\r\nmanner of jackets, are the order of the day, not excepting the immortal\r\nwhite jacket, which begins to be sturdily buttoned up to the throat,\r\nand pulled down vigorously at the skirts, to bring them well over the\r\nloins.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! those skirts were lamentably scanty; and though, with its\r\nquiltings, the jacket was stuffed out about the breasts like a\r\nChristmas turkey, and of a dry cold day kept the wearer warm enough in\r\nthat vicinity, yet about the loins it was shorter than ballet-dancer’s\r\nskirts; so that while my chest was in the temperate zone close\r\nadjoining the torrid, my hapless thighs were in Nova Zembla, hardly an\r\nicicle’s toss from the Pole.\r\n\r\nThen, again, the repeated soakings and dryings it had undergone, had by\r\nthis time made it shrink woefully all over, especially in the arms, so\r\nthat the wristbands had gradually crawled up near to the elbows; and it\r\nrequired an energetic thrust to push the arm through, in drawing the\r\njacket on.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to amend these misfortunes by sewing a sort of canvas\r\nruffle round the skirts, by way of a continuation or supplement to the\r\noriginal work, and by doing the same with the wristbands.\r\n\r\nThis is the time for oil-skin suits, dread-naughts, tarred trowsers and\r\noveralls, sea-boots, comforters, mittens, woollen socks, Guernsey\r\nfrocks, Havre shirts, buffalo-robe shirts, and moose-skin drawers.\r\nEvery man’s jacket is his wigwam, and every man’s hat his caboose.\r\n\r\nPerfect license is now permitted to the men respecting their clothing.\r\nWhatever they can rake and scrape together they put on—swaddling\r\nthemselves in old sails, and drawing old socks over their heads for\r\nnight-caps. This is the time for smiting your chest with your hand, and\r\ntalking loud to keep up the circulation.\r\n\r\nColder, and colder, and colder, till at last we spoke a fleet of\r\nicebergs bound North. After that, it was one incessant “_cold snap_,”\r\nthat almost snapped off our fingers and toes. Cold! It was cold as\r\n_Blue Flujin_, where sailors say fire freezes.\r\n\r\nAnd now coming up with the latitude of the Cape, we stood southward to\r\ngive it a wide berth, and while so doing were becalmed; ay, becalmed\r\noff Cape Horn, which is worse, far worse, than being becalmed on the\r\nLine.\r\n\r\nHere we lay forty-eight hours, during which the cold was intense. I\r\nwondered at the liquid sea, which refused to freeze in such a\r\ntemperature. The clear, cold sky overhead looked like a steel-blue\r\ncymbal, that might ring, could you smite it. Our breath came and went\r\nlike puffs’ of smoke from pipe-bowls. At first there was a long gauky\r\nswell, that obliged us to furl most of the sails, and even send down\r\nt’-gallant-yards, for fear of pitching them overboard.\r\n\r\nOut of sight of land, at this extremity of both the inhabitable and\r\nuninhabitable world, our peopled frigate, echoing with the voices of\r\nmen, the bleating of lambs, the cackling of fowls, the gruntings of\r\npigs, seemed like Noah’s old ark itself, becalmed at the climax of the\r\nDeluge.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be done but patiently to await the pleasure of the\r\nelements, and “whistle for a wind,” the usual practice of seamen in a\r\ncalm. No fire was allowed, except for the indispensable purpose of\r\ncooking, and heating bottles of water to toast Selvagee’s feet. He who\r\npossessed the largest stock of vitality, stood the best chance to\r\nescape freezing. It was horrifying. In such weather any man could have\r\nundergone amputation with great ease, and helped take up the arteries\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this state of affairs had not lasted quite twenty-four hours,\r\nwhen the extreme frigidity of the air, united to our increased tendency\r\nto inactivity, would very soon have rendered some of us subjects for\r\nthe surgeon and his mates, had not a humane proceeding of the Captain\r\nsuddenly impelled us to vigorous exercise.\r\n\r\nAnd here be it said, that the appearance of the Boat-swain, with his\r\nsilver whistle to his mouth, at the main hatchway of the gun-deck, is\r\nalways regarded by the crew with the utmost curiosity, for this\r\nbetokens that some general order is about to be promulgated through the\r\nship. What now? is the question that runs on from man to man. A short\r\npreliminary whistle is then given by “Old Yarn,” as they call him,\r\nwhich whistle serves to collect round him, from their various stations,\r\nhis four mates. Then Yarn, or Pipes, as leader of the orchestra, begins\r\na peculiar call, in which his assistants join. This over, the order,\r\nwhatever it may be, is loudly sung out and prolonged, till the remotest\r\ncorner echoes again. The Boatswain and his mates are the town-criers of\r\na man-of-war.\r\n\r\nThe calm had commenced in the afternoon: and the following morning the\r\nship’s company were electrified by a general order, thus set forth and\r\ndeclared: “_D’ye hear there, for and aft! all hands skylark!_”\r\n\r\nThis mandate, nowadays never used except upon very rare occasions,\r\nproduced the same effect upon the men that Exhilarating Gas would have\r\ndone, or an extra allowance of “grog.” For a time, the wonted\r\ndiscipline of the ship was broken through, and perfect license allowed.\r\nIt was a Babel here, a Bedlam there, and a Pandemonium everywhere. The\r\nTheatricals were nothing compared with it. Then the faint-hearted and\r\ntimorous crawled to their hiding-places, and the lusty and bold shouted\r\nforth their glee.\r\n\r\nGangs of men, in all sorts of outlandish habiliments, wild as those\r\nworn at some crazy carnival, rushed to and fro, seizing upon whomsoever\r\nthey pleased—warrant-officers and dangerous pugilists excepted—pulling\r\nand hauling the luckless tars about, till fairly baited into a genial\r\nwarmth. Some were made fast to and hoisted aloft with a will: others,\r\nmounted upon oars, were ridden fore and aft on a rail, to the\r\nboisterous mirth of the spectators, any one of whom might be the next\r\nvictim. Swings were rigged from the tops, or the masts; and the most\r\nreluctant wights being purposely selected, spite of all struggles, were\r\nswung from East to West, in vast arcs of circles, till almost\r\nbreathless. Hornpipes, fandangoes, Donnybrook-jigs, reels, and\r\nquadrilles, were danced under the very nose of the most mighty captain,\r\nand upon the very quarter-deck and poop. Sparring and wrestling, too,\r\nwere all the vogue; _Kentucky bites_ were given, and the _Indian hug_\r\nexchanged. The din frightened the sea-fowl, that flew by with\r\naccelerated wing.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that several casualties occurred, of which,\r\nhowever, I will relate but one. While the “sky-larking” was at its\r\nheight, one of the fore-top-men—an ugly-tempered devil of a Portuguese,\r\nlooking on—swore that he would be the death of any man who laid violent\r\nhands upon his inviolable person. This threat being overheard, a band\r\nof desperadoes, coming up from behind, tripped him up in an instant,\r\nand in the twinkling of an eye the Portuguese was straddling an oar,\r\nborne aloft by an uproarious multitude, who rushed him along the deck\r\nat a railroad gallop. The living mass of arms all round and beneath him\r\nwas so dense, that every time he inclined one side he was instantly\r\npushed upright, but only to fall over again, to receive another push\r\nfrom the contrary direction. Presently, disengaging his hands from\r\nthose who held them, the enraged seaman drew from his bosom an iron\r\nbelaying-pin, and recklessly laid about him to right and left. Most of\r\nhis persecutors fled; but some eight or ten still stood their ground,\r\nand, while bearing him aloft, endeavoured to wrest the weapon from his\r\nhands. In this attempt, one man was struck on the head, and dropped\r\ninsensible. He was taken up for dead, and carried below to Cuticle, the\r\nsurgeon, while the Portuguese was put under guard. But the wound did\r\nnot prove very serious; and in a few days the man was walking about the\r\ndeck, with his head well bandaged.\r\n\r\nThis occurrence put an end to the “skylarking,” further head-breaking\r\nbeing strictly prohibited. In due time the Portuguese paid the penalty\r\nof his rashness at the gangway; while once again the officers _shipped\r\ntheir quarter-deck faces_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\nTHE PITCH OF THE CAPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEre the calm had yet left us, a sail had been discerned from the\r\nfore-top-mast-head, at a great distance, probably three leagues or\r\nmore. At first it was a mere speck, altogether out of sight from the\r\ndeck. By the force of attraction, or something else equally\r\ninscrutable, two ships in a calm, and equally affected by the currents,\r\nwill always approximate, more or less. Though there was not a breath of\r\nwind, it was not a great while before the strange sail was descried\r\nfrom our bulwarks; gradually, it drew still nearer.\r\n\r\nWhat was she, and whence? There is no object which so excites interest\r\nand conjecture, and, at the same time, baffles both, as a sail, seen as\r\na mere speck on these remote seas off Cape Horn. A breeze! a breeze!\r\nfor lo! the stranger is now perceptibly nearing the frigate; the\r\nofficer’s spy-glass pronounces her a full-rigged ship, with all sail\r\nset, and coming right down to us, though in our own vicinity the calm\r\nstill reigns.\r\n\r\nShe is bringing the wind with her. Hurrah! Ay, there it is! Behold how\r\nmincingly it creeps over the sea, just ruffling and crisping it.\r\n\r\nOur top-men were at once sent aloft to loose the sails, and presently\r\nthey faintly began to distend. As yet we hardly had steerage-way.\r\nToward sunset the stranger bore down before the wind, a complete\r\npyramid of canvas. Never before, I venture to say, was Cape Horn so\r\naudaciously insulted. Stun’-sails alow and aloft; royals, moon-sails,\r\nand everything else. She glided under our stern, within hailing\r\ndistance, and the signal-quarter-master ran up our ensign to the gaff.\r\n\r\n“Ship ahoy!” cried the Lieutenant of the Watch, through his trumpet.\r\n\r\n“Halloa!” bawled an old fellow in a green jacket, clap-ping one hand to\r\nhis mouth, while he held on with the other to the mizzen-shrouds.\r\n\r\n“What ship’s that?”\r\n\r\n“The Sultan, Indiaman, from New York, and bound to Callao and Canton,\r\nsixty days out, all well. What frigate’s that?”\r\n\r\n“The United States ship Neversink, homeward bound.” “Hurrah! hurrah!\r\nhurrah!” yelled our enthusiastic countryman, transported with\r\npatriotism.\r\n\r\nBy this time the Sultan had swept past, but the Lieutenant of the Watch\r\ncould not withhold a parting admonition.\r\n\r\n“D’ye hear? You’d better take in some of your flying-kites there. Look\r\nout for Cape Horn!”\r\n\r\nBut the friendly advice was lost in the now increasing wind. With a\r\nsuddenness by no means unusual in these latitudes, the light breeze\r\nsoon became a succession of sharp squalls, and our sail-proud\r\nbraggadacio of an India-man was observed to let everything go by the\r\nrun, his t’-gallant stun’-sails and flying-jib taking quick leave of\r\nthe spars; the flying-jib was swept into the air, rolled together for a\r\nfew minutes, and tossed about in the squalls like a foot-ball. But the\r\nwind played no such pranks with the more prudently managed canvas of\r\nthe Neversink, though before many hours it was stirring times with us.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight, when the starboard watch, to which, I belonged, was\r\nbelow, the boatswain’s whistle was heard, followed by the shrill cry of\r\n“_All hands take in sail_! jump, men, and save ship!”\r\n\r\nSpringing from our hammocks, we found the frigate leaning over to it so\r\nsteeply, that it was with difficulty we could climb the ladders leading\r\nto the upper deck.\r\n\r\nHere the scene was awful. The vessel seemed to be sailing on her side.\r\nThe main-deck guns had several days previous been run in and housed,\r\nand the port-holes closed, but the lee carronades on the quarter-deck\r\nand forecastle were plunging through the sea, which undulated over them\r\nin milk-white billows of foam. With every lurch to leeward the\r\nyard-arm-ends seemed to dip in the sea, while forward the spray dashed\r\nover the bows in cataracts, and drenched the men who were on the\r\nfore-yard. By this time the deck was alive with the whole strength of\r\nthe ship’s company, five hundred men, officers and all, mostly clinging\r\nto the weather bulwarks. The occasional phosphorescence of the yeasting\r\nsea cast a glare upon their uplifted faces, as a night fire in a\r\npopulous city lights up the panic-stricken crowd.\r\n\r\nIn a sudden gale, or when a large quantity of sail is suddenly to be\r\nfurled, it is the custom for the First Lieutenant to take the trumpet\r\nfrom whoever happens then to be officer of the deck. But Mad Jack had\r\nthe trumpet that watch; nor did the First Lieutenant now seek to wrest\r\nit from his hands. Every eye was upon him, as if we had chosen him from\r\namong us all, to decide this battle with the elements, by single combat\r\nwith the spirit of the Cape; for Mad Jack was the saving genius of the\r\nship, and so proved himself that night. I owe this right hand, that is\r\nthis moment flying over my sheet, and all my present being to Mad Jack.\r\nThe ship’s bows were now butting, battering, ramming, and thundering\r\nover and upon the head seas, and with a horrible wallowing sound our\r\nwhole hull was rolling in the trough of the foam. The gale came athwart\r\nthe deck, and every sail seemed bursting with its wild breath.\r\n\r\nAll the quarter-masters, and several of the forecastle-men, were\r\nswarming round the double-wheel on the quarter-deck. Some jumping up\r\nand down, with their hands upon the spokes; for the whole helm and\r\ngalvanised keel were fiercely feverish, with the life imparted to them\r\nby the tempest.\r\n\r\n“Hard _up_ the helm!” shouted Captain Claret, bursting from his cabin\r\nlike a ghost in his night-dress.\r\n\r\n“Damn you!” raged Mad Jack to the quarter-masters; “hard down—hard\r\n_down_, I say, and be damned to you!”\r\n\r\nContrary orders! but Mad Jack’s were obeyed. His object was to throw\r\nthe ship into the wind, so as the better to admit of close-reefing the\r\ntop-sails. But though the halyards were let go, it was impossible to\r\nclew down the yards, owing to the enormous horizontal strain on the\r\ncanvas. It now blew a hurricane. The spray flew over the ship in\r\nfloods. The gigantic masts seemed about to snap under the world-wide\r\nstrain of the three entire top-sails.\r\n\r\n“Clew down! clew down!” shouted Mad Jack, husky with excitement, and in\r\na frenzy, beating his trumpet against one of the shrouds. But, owing to\r\nthe slant of the ship, the thing could not be done. It was obvious that\r\nbefore many minutes something must go—either sails, rigging, or sticks;\r\nperhaps the hull itself, and all hands.\r\n\r\nPresently a voice from the top exclaimed that there was a rent in the\r\nmain-top-sail. And instantly we heard a report like two or three\r\nmuskets discharged together; the vast sail was rent up and down like\r\nthe Vail of the Temple. This saved the main-mast; for the yard was now\r\nclewed down with comparative ease, and the top-men laid out to stow the\r\nshattered canvas. Soon, the two remaining top-sails were also clewed\r\ndown and close reefed.\r\n\r\nAbove all the roar of the tempest and the shouts of the crew, was heard\r\nthe dismal tolling of the ship’s bell—almost as large as that of a\r\nvillage church—which the violent rolling of the ship was occasioning.\r\nImagination cannot conceive the horror of such a sound in a\r\nnight-tempest at sea.\r\n\r\n“Stop that ghost!” roared Mad Jack; “away, one of you, and wrench off\r\nthe clapper!”\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was this ghost gagged, than a still more appalling sound\r\nwas heard, the rolling to and fro of the heavy shot, which, on the\r\ngun-deck, had broken loose from the gun-racks, and converted that part\r\nof the ship into an immense bowling-alley. Some hands were sent down to\r\nsecure them; but it was as much as their lives were worth. Several were\r\nmaimed; and the midshipmen who were ordered to see the duty performed\r\nreported it impossible, until the storm abated.\r\n\r\nThe most terrific job of all was to furl the main-sail, which, at the\r\ncommencement of the squalls, had been clewed up, coaxed and quieted as\r\nmuch as possible with the bunt-lines and slab-lines. Mad Jack waited\r\nsome time for a lull, ere he gave an order so perilous to be executed.\r\nFor to furl this enormous sail, in such a gale, required at least fifty\r\nmen on the yard; whose weight, superadded to that of the ponderous\r\nstick itself, still further jeopardised their lives. But there was no\r\nprospect of a cessation of the gale, and the order was at last given.\r\n\r\nAt this time a hurricane of slanting sleet and hail was descending upon\r\nus; the rigging was coated with a thin glare of ice, formed within the\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n“Aloft, main-yard-men! and all you main-top-men! and furl the\r\nmain-sail!” cried Mad Jack.\r\n\r\nI dashed down my hat, slipped out of my quilted jacket in an instant,\r\nkicked the shoes from my feet, and, with a crowd of others, sprang for\r\nthe rigging. Above the bulwarks (which in a frigate are so high as to\r\nafford much protection to those on deck) the gale was horrible. The\r\nsheer force of the wind flattened us to the rigging as we ascended, and\r\nevery hand seemed congealing to the icy shrouds by which we held.\r\n\r\n“Up—up, my brave hearties!” shouted Mad Jack; and up we got, some way\r\nor other, all of us, and groped our way out on the yard-arms.\r\n\r\n“Hold on, every mother’s son!” cried an old quarter-gunner at my side.\r\nHe was bawling at the top of his compass; but in the gale, he seemed to\r\nbe whispering; and I only heard him from his being right to windward of\r\nme.\r\n\r\nBut his hint was unnecessary; I dug my nails into the _jack-stays_, and\r\nswore that nothing but death should part me and them until I was able\r\nto turn round and look to windward. As yet, this was impossible; I\r\ncould scarcely hear the man to leeward at my elbow; the wind seemed to\r\nsnatch the words from his mouth and fly away with them to the South\r\nPole.\r\n\r\nAll this while the sail itself was flying about, sometimes catching\r\nover our heads, and threatening to tear us from the yard in spite of\r\nall our hugging. For about three quarters of an hour we thus hung\r\nsuspended right over the rampant billows, which curled their very\r\ncrests under the feet of some four or five of us clinging to the\r\nlee-yard-arm, as if to float us from our place.\r\n\r\nPresently, the word passed along the yard from wind-ward, that we were\r\nordered to come down and leave the sail to blow, since it could not be\r\nfurled. A midshipman, it seemed, had been sent up by the officer of the\r\ndeck to give the order, as no trumpet could be heard where we were.\r\n\r\nThose on the weather yard-arm managed to crawl upon the spar and\r\nscramble down the rigging; but with us, upon the extreme leeward side,\r\nthis feat was out of the question; it was, literary, like climbing a\r\nprecipice to get to wind-ward in order to reach the shrouds: besides,\r\nthe entire yard was now encased in ice, and our hands and feet were so\r\nnumb that we dared not trust our lives to them. Nevertheless, by\r\nassisting each other, we contrived to throw ourselves prostrate along\r\nthe yard, and embrace it with our arms and legs. In this position, the\r\nstun’-sail-booms greatly assisted in securing our hold. Strange as it\r\nmay appear, I do not suppose that, at this moment, the slightest\r\nsensation of fear was felt by one man on that yard. We clung to it with\r\nmight and main; but this was instinct. The truth is, that, in\r\ncircumstances like these, the sense of fear is annihilated in the\r\nunutterable sights that fill all the eye, and the sounds that fill all\r\nthe ear. You become identified with the tempest; your insignificance is\r\nlost in the riot of the stormy universe around.\r\n\r\nBelow us, our noble frigate seemed thrice its real length—a vast black\r\nwedge, opposing its widest end to the combined fury of the sea and\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nAt length the first fury of the gale began to abate, and we at once\r\nfell to pounding our hands, as a preliminary operation to going to\r\nwork; for a gang of men had now ascended to help secure what was left\r\nof the sail; we somehow packed it away, at last, and came down.\r\n\r\nAbout noon the next day, the gale so moderated that we shook two reefs\r\nout of the top-sails, set new courses, and stood due east, with the\r\nwind astern.\r\n\r\nThus, all the fine weather we encountered after first weighing anchor\r\non the pleasant Spanish coast, was but the prelude to this one terrific\r\nnight; more especially, that treacherous calm immediately preceding it.\r\nBut how could we reach our long-promised homes without encountering\r\nCape Horn? by what possibility avoid it? And though some ships have\r\nweathered it without these perils, yet by far the greater part must\r\nencounter them. Lucky it is that it comes about midway in the\r\nhomeward-bound passage, so that the sailors have time to prepare for\r\nit, and time to recover from it after it is astern.\r\n\r\nBut, sailor or landsman, there is some sort of a Cape Horn for all.\r\nBoys! beware of it; prepare for it in time. Gray-beards! thank God it\r\nis passed. And ye lucky livers, to whom, by some rare fatality, your\r\nCape Horns are placid as Lake Lemans, flatter not yourselves that good\r\nluck is judgment and discretion; for all the yolk in your eggs, you\r\nmight have foundered and gone down, had the Spirit of the Cape said the\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nSOME THOUGHTS GROWING OUT OF MAD JACK’S COUNTERMANDING HIS SUPERIOR’S\r\nORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn time of peril, like the needle to the loadstone, obedience,\r\nirrespective of rank, generally flies to him who is best fitted to\r\ncommand. The truth of this seemed evinced in the case of Mad Jack,\r\nduring the gale, and especially at that perilous moment when he\r\ncountermanded the Captain’s order at the helm. But every seaman knew,\r\nat the time, that the Captain’s order was an unwise one in the extreme;\r\nperhaps worse than unwise.\r\n\r\nThese two orders given, by the Captain and his Lieutenant, exactly\r\ncontrasted their characters. By putting the helm _hard up_, the Captain\r\nwas for _scudding_; that is, for flying away from the gale. Whereas,\r\nMad Jack was for running the ship into its teeth. It is needless to say\r\nthat, in almost all cases of similar hard squalls and gales, the latter\r\nstep, though attended with more appalling appearances is, in reality,\r\nthe safer of the two, and the most generally adopted.\r\n\r\nScudding makes you a slave to the blast, which drives you headlong\r\nbefore it; but _running up into the wind’s eye_ enables you, in a\r\ndegree, to hold it at bay. Scudding exposes to the gale your stern, the\r\nweakest part of your hull; the contrary course presents to it your\r\nbows, your strongest part. As with ships, so with men; he who turns his\r\nback to his foe gives him an advantage. Whereas, our ribbed chests,\r\nlike the ribbed bows of a frigate, are as bulkheads to dam off an\r\nonset.\r\n\r\nThat night, off the pitch of the Cape, Captain Claret was hurried forth\r\nfrom his disguises, and, at a manhood-testing conjuncture, appeared in\r\nhis true colours. A thing which every man in the ship had long\r\nsuspected that night was proved true. Hitherto, in going about the\r\nship, and casting his glances among the men, the peculiarly lustreless\r\nrepose of the Captain’s eye—his slow, even, unnecessarily methodical\r\nstep, and the forced firmness of his whole demeanour—though, to a\r\ncasual observer, expressive of the consciousness of command and a\r\ndesire to strike subjection among the crew—all this, to some minds, had\r\nonly been deemed indications of the fact that Captain Claret, while\r\ncarefully shunning positive excesses, continually kept himself in an\r\nuncertain equilibrio between soberness and its reverse; which\r\nequilibrio might be destroyed by the first sharp vicissitude of events.\r\n\r\nAnd though this is only a surmise, nevertheless, as having some\r\nknowledge of brandy and mankind, White-Jacket will venture to state\r\nthat, had Captain Claret been an out-and-out temperance man, he would\r\nnever have given that most imprudent order to _hard up_ the helm. He\r\nwould either have held his peace, and stayed in his cabin, like his\r\ngracious majesty the Commodore, or else have anticipated Mad Jack’s\r\norder, and thundered forth “Hard down the helm!”\r\n\r\nTo show how little real sway at times have the severest restrictive\r\nlaws, and how spontaneous is the instinct of discretion in some minds,\r\nit must here be added, that though Mad Jack, under a hot impulse, had\r\ncountermanded an order of his superior officer before his very face,\r\nyet that severe Article of War, to which he thus rendered himself\r\nobnoxious, was never enforced against him. Nor, so far as any of the\r\ncrew ever knew, did the Captain even venture to reprimand him for his\r\ntemerity.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Mad Jack himself was a lover of strong drink. So\r\nhe was. But here we only see the virtue of being placed in a station\r\nconstantly demanding a cool head and steady nerves, and the misfortune\r\nof filling a post that does _not_ at all times demand these qualities.\r\nSo exact and methodical in most things was the discipline of the\r\nfrigate, that, to a certain extent, Captain Claret was exempted from\r\npersonal interposition in many of its current events, and thereby,\r\nperhaps, was he lulled into security, under the enticing lee of his\r\ndecanter.\r\n\r\nBut as for Mad Jack, he must stand his regular watches, and pace the\r\nquarter-deck at night, and keep a sharp eye to windward. Hence, at sea,\r\nMad Jack tried to make a point of keeping sober, though in very fine\r\nweather he was sometimes betrayed into a glass too many. But with Cape\r\nHorn before him, he took the temperance pledge outright, till that\r\nperilous promontory should be far astern.\r\n\r\nThe leading incident of the gale irresistibly invites the question, Are\r\nthere incompetent officers in the American navy?—that is, incompetent\r\nto the due performance of whatever duties may devolve upon them. But in\r\nthat gallant marine, which, during the late war, gained so much of what\r\nis called _glory_, can there possibly be to-day incompetent officers?\r\n\r\nAs in the camp ashore, so on the quarter-deck at sea—the trumpets of\r\none victory drown the muffled drums of a thousand defeats. And, in\r\ndegree, this holds true of those events of war which are neuter in\r\ntheir character, neither making renown nor disgrace. Besides, as a long\r\narray of ciphers, led by but one solitary numeral, swell, by mere force\r\nof aggregation, into an immense arithmetical sum, even so, in some\r\nbrilliant actions, do a crowd of officers, each inefficient in himself,\r\naggregate renown when banded together, and led by a numeral Nelson or a\r\nWellington. And the renown of such heroes, by outliving themselves,\r\ndescends as a heritage to their subordinate survivors. One large brain\r\nand one large heart have virtue sufficient to magnetise a whole fleet\r\nor an army. And if all the men who, since the beginning of the world,\r\nhave mainly contributed to the warlike successes or reverses of\r\nnations, were now mustered together, we should be amazed to behold but\r\na handful of heroes. For there is no heroism in merely running in and\r\nout a gun at a port-hole, enveloped in smoke or vapour, or in firing\r\noff muskets in platoons at the word of command. This kind of merely\r\nmanual valour is often born of trepidation at the heart. There may be\r\nmen, individually craven, who, united, may display even temerity. Yet\r\nit would be false to deny that, in some in-stances, the lowest privates\r\nhave acquitted themselves with even more gallantry than their\r\ncommodores. True heroism is not in the hand, but in the heart and the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nBut are there incompetent officers in the gallant American navy? For an\r\nAmerican, the question is of no grateful cast. White Jacket must again\r\nevade it, by referring to an historical fact in the history of a\r\nkindred marine, which, from its long standing and magnitude, furnishes\r\nmany more examples of all kinds than our own. And this is the only\r\nreason why it is ever referred to in this narrative. I thank God I am\r\nfree from all national invidiousness.\r\n\r\nIt is indirectly on record in the books of the English Admiralty, that\r\nin the year 1808—after the death of Lord Nelson—when Lord Collingwood\r\ncommanded on the Mediterranean station, and his broken health induced\r\nhim to solicit a furlough, that out of a list of upward of one hundred\r\nadmirals, not a single officer was found who was deemed qualified to\r\nrelieve the applicant with credit to the country. This fact Collingwood\r\nsealed with his life; for, hopeless of being recalled, he shortly after\r\ndied, worn out, at his post. Now, if this was the case in so renowned a\r\nmarine as England’s, what must be inferred with respect to our own? But\r\nherein no special disgrace is involved. For the truth is, that to be an\r\naccomplished and skillful naval generalissimo needs natural\r\ncapabilities of an uncommon order. Still more, it may safely be\r\nasserted, that, worthily to command even a frigate, requires a degree\r\nof natural heroism, talent, judgment, and integrity, that is denied to\r\nmediocrity. Yet these qualifications are not only required, but\r\ndemanded; and no one has a right to be a naval captain unless he\r\npossesses them.\r\n\r\nRegarding Lieutenants, there are not a few Selvagees and Paper Jacks in\r\nthe American navy. Many Commodores know that they have seldom taken a\r\nline-of-battle ship to sea, without feeling more or less nervousness\r\nwhen some of the Lieutenants have the deck at night.\r\n\r\nAccording to the last Navy Register (1849), there are now 68 Captains\r\nin the American navy, collectively drawing about $300,000 annually from\r\nthe public treasury; also, 297 Commanders, drawing about $200,000; and\r\n377 Lieutenants, drawing about half a million; and 451 Midshipmen\r\n(including Passed-midshipmen), also drawing nearly half a million.\r\nConsidering the known facts, that some of these officers are seldom or\r\nnever sent to sea, owing to the Navy Department being well aware of\r\ntheir inefficiency; that others are detailed for pen-and-ink work at\r\nobservatories, and solvers of logarithms in the Coast Survey; while the\r\nreally meritorious officers, who are accomplished practical seamen, are\r\nknown to be sent from ship to ship, with but small interval of a\r\nfurlough; considering all this, it is not too much to say, that no\r\nsmall portion of the million and a half of money above mentioned is\r\nannually paid to national pensioners in disguise, who live on the navy\r\nwithout serving it.\r\n\r\nNothing like this can be even insinuated against the “_forward\r\nofficers_”—Boatswains, Gunners, etc.; nor against the _petty\r\nofficers_—Captains of the Tops, etc.; nor against the able seamen in\r\nthe navy. For if any of _these_ are found wanting, they are forthwith\r\ndisrated or discharged.\r\n\r\nTrue, all experience teaches that, whenever there is a great national\r\nestablishment, employing large numbers of officials, the public must be\r\nreconciled to support many incompetent men; for such is the favouritism\r\nand nepotism always prevailing in the purlieus of these establishments,\r\nthat some incompetent persons are always admitted, to the exclusion of\r\nmany of the worthy.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in a country like ours, boasting of the political\r\nequality of all social conditions, it is a great reproach that such a\r\nthing as a common seaman rising to the rank of a commissioned officer\r\nin our navy, is nowadays almost unheard-of. Yet, in former times, when\r\nofficers have so risen to rank, they have generally proved of signal\r\nusefulness in the service, and sometimes have reflected solid honour\r\nupon the country. Instances in point might be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIs it not well to have our institutions of a piece? Any American\r\nlandsman may hope to become President of the Union—commodore of our\r\nsquadron of states. And every American sailor should be placed in such\r\na position, that he might freely aspire to command a squadron of\r\nfrigates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\nEDGING AWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight before the wind! Ay, blow, blow, ye breezes; so long as ye stay\r\nfair, and we are homeward bound, what care the jolly crew?\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning here that, in nineteen cases out of twenty, a\r\npassage from the Pacific round the Cape is almost sure to be much\r\nshorter, and attended with less hardship, than a passage undertaken\r\nfrom the Atlantic. The reason is, that the gales are mostly from the\r\nwestward, also the currents.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, going before the wind in a frigate, in such a tempest,\r\nhas its annoyances and drawbacks, as well as many other blessings. The\r\ndisproportionate weight of metal upon the spar and gun decks induces a\r\nviolent rolling, unknown to merchant ships. We rolled and rolled on our\r\nway, like the world in its orbit, shipping green seas on both sides,\r\nuntil the old frigate dipped and went into it like a diving-bell.\r\n\r\nThe hatchways of some armed vessels are but poorly secured in bad\r\nweather. This was peculiarly the ease with those of the Neversink. They\r\nwere merely spread over with an old tarpaulin, cracked and rent in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\nIn fair weather, the ship’s company messed on the gun-deck; but as this\r\nwas now flooded almost continually, we were obliged to take our meals\r\nupon the berth-deck, the next one below. One day, the messes of the\r\nstarboard-watch were seated here at dinner; forming little groups,\r\ntwelve or fifteen men in each, reclining about the beef-kids and their\r\npots and pans; when all of a sudden the ship was seized with such a\r\nparoxysm of rolling that, in a single instant, everything on the\r\nberth-deck—pots, kids, sailors, pieces of beef, bread-bags,\r\nclothes-bags, and barges—were tossed indiscriminately from side to\r\nside. It was impossible to stay one’s self; there was nothing but the\r\nbare deck to cling to, which was slippery with the contents of the\r\nkids, and heaving under us as if there were a volcano in the frigate’s\r\nhold. While we were yet sliding in uproarious crowds—all seated—the\r\nwindows of the deck opened, and floods of brine descended,\r\nsimultaneously with a violent lee-roll. The shower was hailed by the\r\nreckless tars with a hurricane of yells; although, for an instant, I\r\nreally imagined we were about being swamped in the sea, such volumes of\r\nwater came cascading down.\r\n\r\nA day or two after, we had made sufficient Easting to stand to the\r\nnorthward, which we did, with the wind astern; thus fairly turning the\r\ncorner without abating our rate of progress. Though we had seen no land\r\nsince leaving Callao, Cape Horn was said to be somewhere to the west of\r\nus; and though there was no positive evidence of the fact, the weather\r\nencountered might be accounted pretty good presumptive proof.\r\n\r\nThe land near Cape Horn, however, is well worth seeing, especially\r\nStaten Land. Upon one occasion, the ship in which I then happened to be\r\nsailing drew near this place from the northward, with a fair, free\r\nwind, blowing steadily, through a bright translucent clay, whose air\r\nwas almost musical with the clear, glittering cold. On our starboard\r\nbeam, like a pile of glaciers in Switzerland, lay this Staten Land,\r\ngleaming in snow-white barrenness and solitude. Unnumbered white\r\nalbatross were skimming the sea near by, and clouds of smaller white\r\nwings fell through the air like snow-flakes. High, towering in their\r\nown turbaned snows, the far-inland pinnacles loomed up, like the border\r\nof some other world. Flashing walls and crystal battlements, like the\r\ndiamond watch-towers along heaven’s furthest frontier.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the latitude of the Cape, we had several storms of snow;\r\none night a considerable quantity laid upon the decks, and some of the\r\nsailors enjoyed the juvenile diversion of snow-balling. Woe unto the\r\n“middy” who that night went forward of the booms. Such a target for\r\nsnow-balls! The throwers could never be known. By some curious sleight\r\nin hurling the missiles, they seemed to be thrown on board by some\r\nhoydenish sea-nymphs outside the frigate.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak Midshipman Pert went below to the surgeon with an alarming\r\nwound, gallantly received in discharging his perilous duty on the\r\nforecastle. The officer of the deck had sent him on an errand, to tell\r\nthe boatswain that he was wanted in the captain’s cabin. While in the\r\nvery act of performing the exploit of delivering the message, Mr. Pert\r\nwas struck on the nose with a snow-ball of wondrous compactness. Upon\r\nbeing informed of the disaster, the rogues expressed the liveliest\r\nsympathy. Pert was no favourite.\r\n\r\nAfter one of these storms, it was a curious sight to see the men\r\nrelieving the uppermost deck of its load of snow. It became the duty of\r\nthe captain of each gun to keep his own station clean; accordingly,\r\nwith an old broom, or “squilgee,” he proceeded to business, often\r\nquarrelling with his next-door neighbours about their scraping their\r\nsnow on his premises. It was like Broadway in winter, the morning after\r\na storm, when rival shop-boys are at work cleaning the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nNow and then, by way of variety, we had a fall of hailstones, so big\r\nthat sometimes we found ourselves dodging them.\r\n\r\nThe Commodore had a Polynesian servant on board, whose services he had\r\nengaged at the Society Islands. Unlike his countrymen, Wooloo was of a\r\nsedate, earnest, and philosophic temperament. Having never been outside\r\nof the tropics before, he found many phenomena off Cape Horn, which\r\nabsorbed his attention, and set him, like other philosophers, to feign\r\ntheories corresponding to the marvels he beheld. At the first snow,\r\nwhen he saw the deck covered all over with a white powder, as it were,\r\nhe expanded his eyes into stewpans; but upon examining the strange\r\nsubstance, he decided that this must be a species of super-fine flower,\r\nsuch as was compounded into his master’s “_duffs_,” and other dainties.\r\nIn vain did an experienced natural philosopher belonging to the\r\nfore-top maintain before his face, that in this hypothesis Wooloo was\r\nmistaken. Wooloo’s opinion remained unchanged for some time.\r\n\r\nAs for the hailstones, they transported him; he went about with a\r\nbucket, making collections, and receiving contributions, for the\r\npurpose of carrying them home to his sweethearts for glass beads; but\r\nhaving put his bucket away, and returning to it again, and finding\r\nnothing but a little water, he accused the by-standers of stealing his\r\nprecious stones.\r\n\r\nThis suggests another story concerning him. The first time he was given\r\na piece of “duff” to eat, he was observed to pick out very carefully\r\nevery raisin, and throw it away, with a gesture indicative of the\r\nhighest disgust. It turned out that he had taken the raisins for bugs.\r\n\r\nIn our man-of-war, this semi-savage, wandering about the gun-deck in\r\nhis barbaric robe, seemed a being from some other sphere. His tastes\r\nwere our abominations: ours his. Our creed he rejected: his we. We\r\nthought him a loon: he fancied us fools. Had the case been reversed;\r\nhad we been Polynesians and he an American, our mutual opinion of each\r\nother would still have remained the same. A fact proving that neither\r\nwas wrong, but both right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\nTHE NIGHT-WATCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough leaving the Cape behind us, the severe cold still continued, and\r\none of its worst consequences was the almost incurable drowsiness\r\ninduced thereby during the long night-watches. All along the decks,\r\nhuddled between the guns, stretched out on the carronade slides, and in\r\nevery accessible nook and corner, you would see the sailors wrapped in\r\ntheir monkey jackets, in a state of half-conscious torpidity, lying\r\nstill and freezing alive, without the power to rise and shake\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“Up—up, you lazy dogs!” our good-natured Third Lieutenant, a Virginian,\r\nwould cry, rapping them with his speaking trumpet. “Get up, and stir\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\nBut in vain. They would rise for an instant, and as soon as his back\r\nwas turned, down they would drop, as if shot through the heart.\r\n\r\nOften I have lain thus when the fact, that if I laid much longer I\r\nwould actually freeze to death, would come over me with such\r\noverpowering force as to break the icy spell, and starting to my feet,\r\nI would endeavour to go through the combined manual and pedal exercise\r\nto restore the circulation. The first fling of my benumbed arm\r\ngenerally struck me in the face, instead of smiting my chest, its true\r\ndestination. But in these cases one’s muscles have their own way.\r\n\r\nIn exercising my other extremities, I was obliged to hold on to\r\nsomething, and leap with both feet; for my limbs seemed as destitute of\r\njoints as a pair of canvas pants spread to dry, and frozen stiff.\r\n\r\nWhen an order was given to haul the braces—which required the strength\r\nof the entire watch, some two hundred men—a spectator would have\r\nsupposed that all hands had received a stroke of the palsy. Roused from\r\ntheir state of enchantment, they came halting and limping across the\r\ndecks, falling against each other, and, for a few moments, almost\r\nunable to handle the ropes. The slightest exertion seemed intolerable;\r\nand frequently a body of eighty or a hundred men summoned to brace the\r\nmain-yard, would hang over the rope for several minutes, waiting for\r\nsome active fellow to pick it up and put it into their hands. Even\r\nthen, it was some time before they were able to do anything. They made\r\nall the motions usual in hauling a rope, but it was a long time before\r\nthe yard budged an inch. It was to no purpose that the officers swore\r\nat them, or sent the midshipmen among them to find out who those\r\n“_horse-marines_” and “_sogers_” were. The sailors were so enveloped in\r\nmonkey jackets, that in the dark night there was no telling one from\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n“Here, _you_, sir!” cries little Mr. Pert eagerly catching hold of the\r\nskirts of an old sea-dog, and trying to turn him round, so as to peer\r\nunder his tarpaulin. “Who are _you_, sir? What’s your name?”\r\n\r\n“Find out, Milk-and-Water,” was the impertinent rejoinder.\r\n\r\n“Blast you! you old rascal; I’ll have you licked for that! Tell me his\r\nname, some of you!” turning round to the bystanders.\r\n\r\n“Gammon!” cries a voice at a distance.\r\n\r\n“Hang me, but I know _you_, sir! and here’s at you!” and, so saying,\r\nMr. Pert drops the impenetrable unknown, and makes into the crowd after\r\nthe bodiless voice. But the attempt to find an owner for that voice is\r\nquite as idle as the effort to discover the contents of the monkey\r\njacket.\r\n\r\nAnd here sorrowful mention must be made of something which, during this\r\nstate of affairs, most sorely afflicted me. Most monkey jackets are of\r\na dark hue; mine, as I have fifty times repeated, and say again, was\r\nwhite. And thus, in those long, dark nights, when it was my\r\nquarter-watch on deck, and not in the top, and others went skulking and\r\n“sogering” about the decks, secure from detection—their identity\r\nundiscoverable—my own hapless jacket for ever proclaimed the name of\r\nits wearer. It gave me many a hard job, which otherwise I should have\r\nescaped. When an officer wanted a man for any particular duty—running\r\naloft, say, to communicate some slight order to the captains of the\r\ntops—how easy, in that mob of incognitoes, to individualise “_that\r\nwhite jacket_,” and dispatch him on the errand. Then, it would never do\r\nfor me to hang back when the ropes were being pulled.\r\n\r\nIndeed, upon all these occasions, such alacrity and cheerfulness was I\r\nobliged to display, that I was frequently held up as an illustrious\r\nexample of activity, which the rest were called upon to emulate.\r\n“Pull—pull! you lazy lubbers! Look at White-Jacket, there; pull like\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\nOh! how I execrated my luckless garment; how often I scoured the deck\r\nwith it to give it a tawny hue; how often I supplicated the inexorable\r\nBrush, captain of the paint-room, for just one brushful of his\r\ninvaluable pigment. Frequently, I meditated giving it a toss overboard;\r\nbut I had not the resolution. Jacketless at sea! Jacketless so near\r\nCape Horn! The thought was unendurable. And, at least, my garment was a\r\njacket in name, if not in utility.\r\n\r\nAt length I essayed a “swap.” “Here, Bob,” said I, assuming all\r\npossible suavity, and accosting a mess-mate with a sort of diplomatic\r\nassumption of superiority, “suppose I was ready to part with this\r\n‘grego’ of mine, and take yours in exchange—what would you give me to\r\nboot?”\r\n\r\n“Give you to _boot?_” he exclaimed, with horror; “I wouldn’t take your\r\ninfernal jacket for a gift!”\r\n\r\nHow I hailed every snow-squall; for then—blessings on them!—many of the\r\nmen became _white-jackets_ along with myself; and, powdered with the\r\nflakes, we all looked like millers.\r\n\r\nWe had six lieutenants, all of whom, with the exception of the First\r\nLieutenant, by turns headed the watches. Three of these officers,\r\nincluding Mad Jack, were strict disciplinarians, and never permitted us\r\nto lay down on deck during the night. And, to tell the truth, though it\r\ncaused much growling, it was far better for our health to be thus kept\r\non our feet. So promenading was all the vogue. For some of us, however,\r\nit was like pacing in a dungeon; for, as we had to keep at our\r\nstations—some at the halyards, some at the braces, and elsewhere—and\r\nwere not allowed to stroll about indefinitely, and fairly take the\r\nmeasure of the ship’s entire keel, we were fain to confine ourselves to\r\nthe space of a very few feet. But the worse of this was soon over. The\r\nsuddenness of the change in the temperature consequent on leaving Cape\r\nHorn, and steering to the northward with a ten-knot breeze, is a\r\nnoteworthy thing. To-day, you are assailed by a blast that seems to\r\nhave edged itself on icebergs; but in a little more than a week, your\r\njacket may be superfluous.\r\n\r\nOne word more about Cape Horn, and we have done with it.\r\n\r\nYears hence, when a ship-canal shall have penetrated the Isthmus of\r\nDarien, and the traveller be taking his seat in the ears at Cape Cod\r\nfor Astoria, it will be held a thing almost incredible that, for so\r\nlong a period, vessels bound to the Nor’-west Coast from New York\r\nshould, by going round Cape Horn, have lengthened their voyages some\r\nthousands of miles. “In those unenlightened days” (I quote, in advance,\r\nthe language of some future philosopher), “entire years were frequently\r\nconsumed in making the voyage to and from the Spice Islands, the\r\npresent fashionable watering-place of the beau-monde of Oregon.” Such\r\nmust be our national progress.\r\n\r\nWhy, sir, that boy of yours will, one of these days, be sending your\r\ngrandson to the salubrious city of Jeddo to spend his summer vacations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\nA PEEP THROUGH A PORT-HOLE AT THE SUBTERRANEAN PARTS OF A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile now running rapidly away from the bitter coast of Patagonia,\r\nbattling with the night-watches—still cold—as best we may; come under\r\nthe lee of my white-jacket, reader, while I tell of the less painful\r\nsights to be seen in a frigate.\r\n\r\nA hint has already been conveyed concerning the subterranean depths of\r\nthe Neversink’s hold. But there is no time here to speak of the\r\n_spirit-room_, a cellar down in the after-hold, where the sailor’s\r\n“grog” is kept; nor of the _cabletiers_, where the great hawsers and\r\nchains are piled, as you see them at a large ship-chandler’s on shore;\r\nnor of the grocer’s vaults, where tierces of sugar, molasses, vinegar,\r\nrice, and flour are snugly stowed; nor of the _sail-room_, full as a\r\nsail-maker’s loft ashore—piled up with great top-sails and\r\ntop-gallant-sails, all ready-folded in their places, like so many white\r\nvests in a gentleman’s wardrobe; nor of the copper and copper-fastened\r\n_magazine_, closely packed with kegs of powder, great-gun and small-arm\r\ncartridges; nor of the immense _shot-lockers_, or subterranean\r\narsenals, full as a bushel of apples with twenty-four-pound balls; nor\r\nof the _bread-room_, a large apartment, tinned all round within to keep\r\nout the mice, where the hard biscuit destined for the consumption of\r\nfive hundred men on a long voyage is stowed away by the cubic yard; nor\r\nof the vast iron tanks for fresh water in the hold, like the reservoir\r\nlakes at Fairmount, in Philadelphia; nor of the _paint-room_, where the\r\nkegs of white-lead, and casks of linseed oil, and all sorts of pots and\r\nbrushes, are kept; nor of the _armoror’s smithy_, where the ship’s\r\nforges and anvils may be heard ringing at times; I say I have no time\r\nto speak of these things, and many more places of note.\r\n\r\nBut there is one very extensive warehouse among the rest that needs\r\nspecial mention—_the ship’s Yeoman’s storeroom_. In the Neversink it\r\nwas down in the ship’s basement, beneath the berth-deck, and you went\r\nto it by way of the _Fore-passage_, a very dim, devious corridor,\r\nindeed. Entering—say at noonday—you find yourself in a gloomy\r\napartment, lit by a solitary lamp. On one side are shelves, filled with\r\nballs of _marline, ratlin-stuf, seizing-stuff, spun-yarn_, and numerous\r\ntwines of assorted sizes. In another direction you see large cases\r\ncontaining heaps of articles, reminding one of a shoemaker’s\r\nfurnishing-store—wooden _serving-mallets, fids, toggles_, and\r\n_heavers:_ iron _prickers_ and _marling-spikes;_ in a third quarter you\r\nsee a sort of hardware shop—shelves piled with all manner of hooks,\r\nbolts, nails, screws, and _thimbles;_ and, in still another direction,\r\nyou see a block-maker’s store, heaped up with lignum-vitae sheeves and\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nThrough low arches in the bulkhead beyond, you peep in upon distant\r\nvaults and catacombs, obscurely lighted in the far end, and showing\r\nimmense coils of new ropes, and other bulky articles, stowed in tiers,\r\nall savouring of tar.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most curious department of these mysterious store-rooms\r\nis the armoury, where the spikes, cutlasses, pistols, and belts,\r\nforming the arms of the boarders in time of action, are hung against\r\nthe walls, and suspended in thick rows from the beams overhead. Here,\r\ntoo, are to be seen scores of Colt’s patent revolvers, which, though\r\nfurnished with but one tube, multiply the fatal bullets, as the naval\r\ncat-o’-nine-tails, with a cannibal cruelty, in one blow nine times\r\nmultiplies a culprit’s lashes; so that when a sailor is ordered one\r\ndozen lashes, the sentence should read one hundred and eight. All these\r\narms are kept in the brightest order, wearing a fine polish, and may\r\ntruly be said to _reflect_ credit on the Yeoman and his mates.\r\n\r\nAmong the lower grade of officers in a man-of-war, that of Yeoman is\r\nnot the least important. His responsibilities are denoted by his pay.\r\nWhile the _petty officers_, quarter-gunners, captains of the tops, and\r\nothers, receive but fifteen and eighteen dollars a month—but little\r\nmore than a mere able seamen—the Yeoman in an American line-of-battle\r\nship receives forty dollars, and in a frigate thirty-five dollars per\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nHe is accountable for all the articles under his charge, and on no\r\naccount must deliver a yard of twine or a ten-penny nail to the\r\nboatswain or carpenter, unless shown a written requisition and order\r\nfrom the Senior Lieutenant. The Yeoman is to be found burrowing in his\r\nunderground store-rooms all the day long, in readiness to serve\r\nlicensed customers. But in the counter, behind which he usually stands,\r\nthere is no place for a till to drop the shillings in, which takes away\r\nnot a little from the most agreeable part of a storekeeper’s duties.\r\nNor, among the musty, old account-books in his desk, where he registers\r\nall expenditures of his stuffs, is there any cash or check book.\r\n\r\nThe Yeoman of the Neversink was a somewhat odd specimen of a\r\nTroglodyte. He was a little old man, round-shouldered, bald-headed,\r\nwith great goggle-eyes, looking through portentous round spectacles,\r\nwhich he called his _barnacles_. He was imbued with a wonderful zeal\r\nfor the naval service, and seemed to think that, in keeping his pistols\r\nand cutlasses free from rust, he preserved the national honour\r\nuntarnished. After _general quarters_, it was amusing to watch his\r\nanxious air as the various _petty officers_ restored to him the arms\r\nused at the martial exercises of the crew. As successive bundles would\r\nbe deposited on his counter, he would count over the pistols and\r\ncutlasses, like an old housekeeper telling over her silver forks and\r\nspoons in a pantry before retiring for the night. And often, with a\r\nsort of dark lantern in his hand, he might be seen poking into his\r\nfurthest vaults and cellars, and counting over his great coils of\r\nropes, as if they were all jolly puncheons of old Port and Madeira.\r\n\r\nBy reason of his incessant watchfulness and unaccountable bachelor\r\noddities, it was very difficult for him to retain in his employment the\r\nvarious sailors who, from time to time, were billeted with him to do\r\nthe duty of subalterns. In particular, he was always desirous of having\r\nat least one steady, faultless young man, of a literary taste, to keep\r\nan eye to his account-books, and swab out the armoury every morning. It\r\nwas an odious business this, to be immured all day in such a bottomless\r\nhole, among tarry old ropes and villainous guns and pistols. It was\r\nwith peculiar dread that I one day noticed the goggle-eyes of _Old\r\nRevolver_, as they called him, fastened upon me with a fatal glance of\r\ngood-will and approbation. He had somehow heard of my being a very\r\nlearned person, who could both read and write with extraordinary\r\nfacility; and moreover that I was a rather reserved youth, who kept his\r\nmodest, unassuming merits in the background. But though, from the keen\r\nsense of my situation as a man-of-war’s-man all this about my keeping\r\nmyself in the _back_ ground was true enough, yet I had no idea of\r\nhiding my diffident merits _under_ ground. I became alarmed at the old\r\nYeoman’s goggling glances, lest he should drag me down into tarry\r\nperdition in his hideous store-rooms. But this fate was providentially\r\naverted, owing to mysterious causes which I never could fathom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\nTHE GUNNER UNDER HATCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong such a crowd of marked characters as were to be met with on board\r\nour frigate, many of whom moved in mysterious circles beneath the\r\nlowermost deck, and at long intervals flitted into sight like\r\napparitions, and disappeared again for whole weeks together, there were\r\nsome who inordinately excited my curiosity, and whose names, callings,\r\nand precise abodes I industriously sought out, in order to learn\r\nsomething satisfactory concerning them.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in these inquiries, often fruitless, or but partially\r\ngratified, I could not but regret that there was no public printed\r\nDirectory for the Neversink, such as they have in large towns,\r\ncontaining an alphabetic list of all the crew, and where they might be\r\nfound. Also, in losing myself in some remote, dark corner of the bowels\r\nof the frigate, in the vicinity of the various store-rooms, shops, and\r\nwarehouses, I much lamented that no enterprising tar had yet thought of\r\ncompiling a _Hand-book of the Neversink_, so that the tourist might\r\nhave a reliable guide.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there were several parts of the ship under hatches shrouded in\r\nmystery, and completely inaccessible to the sailor.\r\n\r\nWondrous old doors, barred and bolted in dingy bulkheads, must have\r\nopened into regions full of interest to a successful explorer.\r\n\r\nThey looked like the gloomy entrances to family vaults of buried dead;\r\nand when I chanced to see some unknown functionary insert his key, and\r\nenter these inexplicable apartments with a battle-lantern, as if on\r\nsolemn official business, I almost quaked to dive in with him, and\r\nsatisfy myself whether these vaults indeed contained the mouldering\r\nrelics of by-gone old Commodores and Post-captains. But the habitations\r\nof the living commodore and captain—their spacious and curtained\r\ncabins—were themselves almost as sealed volumes, and I passed them in\r\nhopeless wonderment, like a peasant before a prince’s palace. Night and\r\nday armed sentries guarded their sacred portals, cutlass in hand; and\r\nhad I dared to cross their path, I would infallibly have been cut down,\r\nas if in battle. Thus, though for a period of more than a year I was an\r\ninmate of this floating box of live-oak, yet there were numberless\r\nthings in it that, to the last, remained wrapped in obscurity, or\r\nconcerning which I could only lose myself in vague speculations. I was\r\nas a Roman Jew of the Middle Ages, confined to the Jews’ quarter of the\r\ntown, and forbidden to stray beyond my limits. Or I was as a modern\r\ntraveller in the same famous city, forced to quit it at last without\r\ngaining ingress to the most mysterious haunts—the innermost shrine of\r\nthe Pope, and the dungeons and cells of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nBut among all the persons and things on board that puzzled me, and\r\nfilled me most with strange emotions of doubt, misgivings and mystery,\r\nwas the Gunner—a short, square, grim man, his hair and beard grizzled\r\nand singed, as if with gunpowder. His skin was of a flecky brown, like\r\nthe stained barrel of a fowling-piece, and his hollow eyes burned in\r\nhis head like blue-lights. He it was who had access to many of those\r\nmysterious vaults I have spoken of. Often he might be seen groping his\r\nway into them, followed by his subalterns, the old quarter-gunners, as\r\nif intent upon laying a train of powder to blow up the ship. I\r\nremembered Guy Fawkes and the Parliament-house, and made earnest\r\ninquiry whether this gunner was a Roman Catholic. I felt relieved when\r\ninformed that he was not.\r\n\r\nA little circumstance which one of his _mates_ once told me heightened\r\nthe gloomy interest with which I regarded his chief. He told me that,\r\nat periodical intervals, his master the Gunner, accompanied by his\r\nphalanx, entered into the great Magazine under the Gun-room, of which\r\nhe had sole custody and kept the key, nearly as big as the key of the\r\nBastile, and provided with lanterns, something like Sir Humphrey Davy’s\r\nSafety-lamp for coal mines, proceeded to turn, end for end, all the\r\nkegs of powder and packages of cartridges stored in this innermost\r\nexplosive vault, lined throughout with sheets of copper. In the\r\nvestibule of the Magazine, against the panelling, were several pegs for\r\nslippers, and, before penetrating further than that vestibule, every\r\nman of the gunner’s gang silently removed his shoes, for fear that the\r\nnails in their heels might possibly create a spark, by striking against\r\nthe coppered floor within. Then, with slippered feet and with hushed\r\nwhispers, they stole into the heart of the place.\r\n\r\nThis turning of the powder was to preserve its inflammability. And\r\nsurely it was a business full of direful interest, to be buried so deep\r\nbelow the sun, handling whole barrels of powder, any one of which,\r\ntouched by the smallest spark, was powerful enough to blow up a whole\r\nstreet of warehouses.\r\n\r\nThe gunner went by the name of _Old Combustibles_, though I thought\r\nthis an undignified name for so momentous a personage, who had all our\r\nlives in his hand.\r\n\r\nWhile we lay in Callao, we received from shore several barrels of\r\npowder. So soon as the _launch_ came alongside with them, orders were\r\ngiven to extinguish all lights and all fires in the ship; and the\r\nmaster-at-arms and his corporals inspected every deck to see that this\r\norder was obeyed; a very prudent precaution, no doubt, but not observed\r\nat all in the Turkish navy. The Turkish sailors will sit on their\r\ngun-carriages, tranquilly smoking, while kegs of powder are being\r\nrolled under their ignited pipe-bowls. This shows the great comfort\r\nthere is in the doctrine of these Fatalists, and how such a doctrine,\r\nin some things at least, relieves men from nervous anxieties. But we\r\nall are Fatalists at bottom. Nor need we so much marvel at the heroism\r\nof that army officer, who challenged his personal foe to bestride a\r\nbarrel of powder with him—the match to be placed between them—and be\r\nblown up in good company, for it is pretty certain that the whole earth\r\nitself is a vast hogshead, full of inflammable materials, and which we\r\nare always bestriding; at the same time, that all good Christians\r\nbelieve that at any minute the last day may come and the terrible\r\ncombustion of the entire planet ensue.\r\n\r\nAs if impressed with a befitting sense of the awfulness of his calling,\r\nour gunner always wore a fixed expression of solemnity, which was\r\nheightened by his grizzled hair and beard. But what imparted such a\r\nsinister look to him, and what wrought so upon my imagination\r\nconcerning this man, was a frightful scar crossing his left cheek and\r\nforehead. He had been almost mortally wounded, they said, with a\r\nsabre-cut, during a frigate engagement in the last war with Britain.\r\n\r\nHe was the most methodical, exact, and punctual of all the forward\r\nofficers. Among his other duties, it pertained to him, while in\r\nharbour, to see that at a certain hour in the evening one of the great\r\nguns was discharged from the forecastle, a ceremony only observed in a\r\nflag-ship. And always at the precise moment you might behold him\r\nblowing his match, then applying it; and with that booming thunder in\r\nhis ear, and the smell of the powder in his hair, he retired to his\r\nhammock for the night. What dreams he must have had!\r\n\r\nThe same precision was observed when ordered to fire a gun to _bring\r\nto_ some ship at sea; for, true to their name, and preserving its\r\napplicability, even in times of peace, all men-of-war are great bullies\r\non the high seas. They domineer over the poor merchantmen, and with a\r\nhissing hot ball sent bowling across the ocean, compel them to stop\r\ntheir headway at pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt was enough to make you a man of method for life, to see the gunner\r\nsuperintending his subalterns, when preparing the main-deck batteries\r\nfor a great national salute. While lying in harbour, intelligence\r\nreached us of the lamentable casualty that befell certain high officers\r\nof state, including the acting Secretary of the Navy himself, some\r\nother member of the President’s cabinet, a Commodore, and others, all\r\nengaged in experimenting upon a new-fangled engine of war. At the same\r\ntime with the receipt of this sad news, orders arrived to fire\r\nminute-guns for the deceased head of the naval department. Upon this\r\noccasion the gunner was more than usually ceremonious, in seeing that\r\nthe long twenty-fours were thoroughly loaded and rammed down, and then\r\naccurately marked with chalk, so as to be discharged in undeviating\r\nrotation, first from the larboard side, and then from the starboard.\r\n\r\nBut as my ears hummed, and all my bones danced in me with the\r\nreverberating din, and my eyes and nostrils were almost suffocated with\r\nthe smoke, and when I saw this grim old gunner firing away so solemnly,\r\nI thought it a strange mode of honouring a man’s memory who had himself\r\nbeen slaughtered by a cannon. Only the smoke, that, after rolling in at\r\nthe port-holes, rapidly drifted away to leeward, and was lost to view,\r\nseemed truly emblematical touching the personage thus honoured, since\r\nthat great non-combatant, the Bible, assures us that our life is but a\r\nvapour, that quickly passeth away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\nA DISH OF DUNDERFUNK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn men-of-war, the space on the uppermost deck, round about the\r\nmain-mast, is the Police-office, Court-house, and yard of execution,\r\nwhere all charges are lodged, causes tried, and punishment\r\nadministered. In frigate phrase, to be _brought up to the mast_, is\r\nequivalent to being presented before the grand-jury, to see whether a\r\ntrue bill will be found against you.\r\n\r\nFrom the merciless, inquisitorial _baiting_, which sailors, charged\r\nwith offences, too often experience _at the mast_, that vicinity is\r\nusually known among them as the _bull-ring_.\r\n\r\nThe main-mast, moreover, is the only place where the sailor can hold\r\nformal communication with the captain and officers. If any one has been\r\nrobbed; if any one has been evilly entreated; if any one’s character\r\nhas been defamed; if any one has a request to present; if any one has\r\naught important for the executive of the ship to know—straight to the\r\nmain-mast he repairs; and stands there—generally with his hat\r\noff—waiting the pleasure of the officer of the deck, to advance and\r\ncommunicate with him. Often, the most ludicrous scenes occur, and the\r\nmost comical complaints are made.\r\n\r\nOne clear, cold morning, while we were yet running away from the Cape,\r\na raw boned, crack-pated Down Easter, belonging to the Waist, made his\r\nappearance at the mast, dolefully exhibiting a blackened tin pan,\r\nbearing a few crusty traces of some sort of a sea-pie, which had been\r\ncooked in it.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, what now?” said the Lieutenant of the Deck, advancing.\r\n\r\n“They stole it, sir; all my nice _dunderfunk_, sir; they did, sir,”\r\nwhined the Down Easter, ruefully holding up his pan. “Stole your\r\n_dunderfunk!_ what’s that?”\r\n\r\n“_Dunderfunk_, sir, _dunderfunk_; a cruel nice dish as ever man put\r\ninto him.”\r\n\r\n“Speak out, sir; what’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“My _dunderfunk_, sir—as elegant a dish of _dunderfunk_ as you ever\r\nsee, sir—they stole it, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Go forward, you rascal!” cried the Lieutenant, in a towering rage, “or\r\nelse stop your whining. Tell me, what’s the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, them ’ere two fellows, Dobs and Hodnose, stole my\r\n_dunderfunk_.”\r\n\r\n“Once more, sir, I ask what that _dundledunk_ is? Speak!” “As cruel a\r\nnice——”\r\n\r\n“Be off, sir! sheer!” and muttering something about _non compos\r\nmentis_, the Lieutenant stalked away; while the Down Easter beat a\r\nmelancholy retreat, holding up his pan like a tambourine, and making\r\ndolorous music on it as he went.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going with that tear in your eye, like a travelling\r\nrat?” cried a top-man.\r\n\r\n“Oh! he’s going home to Down East,” said another; “so far eastward, you\r\nknow, _shippy_, that they have to pry up the sun with a handspike.”\r\n\r\nTo make this anecdote plainer, be it said that, at sea, the monotonous\r\nround of salt beef and pork at the messes of the sailors—where but very\r\nfew of the varieties of the season are to be found—induces them to\r\nadopt many contrivances in order to diversify their meals. Hence the\r\nvarious sea-rolls, made dishes, and Mediterranean pies, well known by\r\nmen-of-war’s-men—_Scouse, Lob-scouse, Soft-Tack, Soft-Tommy,\r\nSkillagalee, Burgoo, Dough-boys, Lob-Dominion, Dog’s-Body_, and lastly,\r\nand least known, _Dunderfunk_; all of which come under the general\r\ndenomination of _Manavalins_.\r\n\r\n_Dunderfunk_ is made of hard biscuit, hashed and pounded, mixed with\r\nbeef fat, molasses, and water, and baked brown in a pan. And to those\r\nwho are beyond all reach of shore delicacies, this _dunderfunk_, in the\r\nfeeling language of the Down Easter, is certainly “_a cruel nice\r\ndish_.”\r\n\r\nNow the only way that a sailor, after preparing his _dunderfunk_, could\r\nget it cooked on board the Neversink, was by slily going to _Old\r\nCoffee_, the ship’s cook, and bribing him to put it into his oven. And\r\nas some such dishes or other are well known to be all the time in the\r\noven, a set of unprincipled gourmands are constantly on the look-out\r\nfor the chance of stealing them. Generally, two or three league\r\ntogether, and while one engages _Old Coffee_ in some interesting\r\nconversation touching his wife and family at home, another snatches the\r\nfirst thing he can lay hands on in the oven, and rapidly passes it to\r\nthe third man, who at his earliest leisure disappears with it.\r\n\r\nIn this manner had the Down Easter lost his precious pie, and afterward\r\nfound the empty pan knocking about the forecastle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\nA FLOGGING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you begin the day with a laugh, you may, nevertheless, end it with a\r\nsob and a sigh.\r\n\r\nAmong the many who were exceedingly diverted with the scene between the\r\nDown Easter and the Lieutenant, none laughed more heartily than John,\r\nPeter, Mark, and Antone—four sailors of the starboard-watch. The same\r\nevening these four found themselves prisoners in the “brig,” with a\r\nsentry standing over them. They were charged with violating a\r\nwell-known law of the ship—having been engaged in one of those tangled,\r\ngeneral fights sometimes occurring among sailors. They had nothing to\r\nanticipate but a flogging, at the captain’s pleasure.\r\n\r\nToward evening of the next day, they were startled by the dread summons\r\nof the boatswain and his mates at the principal hatchway—a summons that\r\never sends a shudder through every manly heart in a frigate:\r\n\r\n“_All hands witness punishment, ahoy!_”\r\n\r\nThe hoarseness of the cry, its unrelenting prolongation, its being\r\ncaught up at different points, and sent through the lowermost depths of\r\nthe ship; all this produces a most dismal effect upon every heart not\r\ncalloused by long habituation to it.\r\n\r\nHowever much you may desire to absent yourself from the scene that\r\nensues, yet behold it you must; or, at least, stand near it you must;\r\nfor the regulations enjoin the attendance of the entire ship’s company,\r\nfrom the corpulent Captain himself to the smallest boy who strikes the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n“_All hands witness punishment, ahoy!_”\r\n\r\nTo the sensitive seaman that summons sounds like a doom. He knows that\r\nthe same law which impels it—the same law by which the culprits of the\r\nday must suffer; that by that very law he also is liable at any time to\r\nbe judged and condemned. And the inevitableness of his own presence at\r\nthe scene; the strong arm that drags him in view of the scourge, and\r\nholds him there till all is over; forcing upon his loathing eye and\r\nsoul the sufferings and groans of men who have familiarly consorted\r\nwith him, eaten with him, battled out watches with him—men of his own\r\ntype and badge—all this conveys a terrible hint of the omnipotent\r\nauthority under which he lives. Indeed, to such a man the naval summons\r\nto witness punishment carries a thrill, somewhat akin to what we may\r\nimpute to the quick and the dead, when they shall hear the Last Trump,\r\nthat is to bid them all arise in their ranks, and behold the final\r\npenalties inflicted upon the sinners of our race.\r\n\r\nBut it must not be imagined that to all men-of-war’s-men this summons\r\nconveys such poignant emotions; but it is hard to decide whether one\r\nshould be glad or sad that this is not the case; whether it is grateful\r\nto know that so much pain is avoided, or whether it is far sadder to\r\nthink that, either from constitutional hard-heartedness or the\r\nmultiplied searings of habit, hundreds of men-of-war’s-men have been\r\nmade proof against the sense of degradation, pity, and shame.\r\n\r\nAs if in sympathy with the scene to be enacted, the sun, which the day\r\nprevious had merrily flashed upon the tin pan of the disconsolate Down\r\nEaster, was now setting over the dreary waters, veiling itself in\r\nvapours. The wind blew hoarsely in the cordage; the seas broke heavily\r\nagainst the bows; and the frigate, staggering under whole top-sails,\r\nstrained as in agony on her way.\r\n\r\n“_All hands witness punishment, ahoy!_”\r\n\r\nAt the summons the crew crowded round the main-mast; multitudes eager\r\nto obtain a good place on the booms, to overlook the scene; many\r\nlaughing and chatting, others canvassing the case of the culprits; some\r\nmaintaining sad, anxious countenances, or carrying a suppressed\r\nindignation in their eyes; a few purposely keeping behind to avoid\r\nlooking on; in short, among five hundred men, there was every possible\r\nshade of character.\r\n\r\nAll the officers—midshipmen included—stood together in a group on the\r\nstarboard side of the main-mast; the First Lieutenant in advance, and\r\nthe surgeon, whose special duty it is to be present at such times,\r\nstanding close by his side.\r\n\r\nPresently the Captain came forward from his cabin, and stood in the\r\ncentre of this solemn group, with a small paper in his hand. That paper\r\nwas the daily report of offences, regularly laid upon his table every\r\nmorning or evening, like the day’s journal placed by a bachelor’s\r\nnapkin at breakfast.\r\n\r\n“Master-at-arms, bring up the prisoners,” he said.\r\n\r\nA few moments elapsed, during which the Captain, now clothed in his\r\nmost dreadful attributes, fixed his eyes severely upon the crew, when\r\nsuddenly a lane formed through the crowd of seamen, and the prisoners\r\nadvanced—the master-at-arms, rattan in hand, on one side, and an armed\r\nmarine on the other—and took up their stations at the mast.\r\n\r\n“You John, you Peter, you Mark, you Antone,” said the Captain, “were\r\nyesterday found fighting on the gun-deck. Have you anything to say?”\r\n\r\nMark and Antone, two steady, middle-aged men, whom I had often admired\r\nfor their sobriety, replied that they did not strike the first blow;\r\nthat they had submitted to much before they had yielded to their\r\npassions; but as they acknowledged that they had at last defended\r\nthemselves, their excuse was overruled.\r\n\r\nJohn—a brutal bully, who, it seems, was the real author of the\r\ndisturbance—was about entering into a long extenuation, when he was cut\r\nshort by being made to confess, irrespective of circumstances, that he\r\nhad been in the fray.\r\n\r\nPeter, a handsome lad about nineteen years old, belonging to the\r\nmizzen-top, looked pale and tremulous. He was a great favourite in his\r\npart of the ship, and especially in his own mess, principally composed\r\nof lads of his own age. That morning two of his young mess-mates had\r\ngone to his bag, taken out his best clothes, and, obtaining the\r\npermission of the marine sentry at the “brig,” had handed them to him,\r\nto be put on against being summoned to the mast. This was done to\r\npropitiate the Captain, as most captains love to see a tidy sailor. But\r\nit would not do. To all his supplications the Captain turned a deaf\r\near. Peter declared that he had been struck twice before he had\r\nreturned a blow. “No matter,” said the Captain, “you struck at last,\r\ninstead of reporting the case to an officer. I allow no man to fight on\r\nboard here but myself. I do the fighting.”\r\n\r\n“Now, men,” he added, “you all admit the charge; you know the penalty.\r\nStrip! Quarter-masters, are the gratings rigged?”\r\n\r\nThe gratings are square frames of barred wood-work, sometimes placed\r\nover the hatchways. One of these squares was now laid on the deck,\r\nclose to the ship’s bulwarks, and while the remaining preparations were\r\nbeing made, the master-at-arms assisted the prisoners in removing their\r\njackets and shirts. This done, their shirts were loosely thrown over\r\ntheir shoulders.\r\n\r\nAt a sign from the Captain, John, with a shameless leer, advanced, and\r\nstood passively upon the grating, while the bare-headed old\r\nquarter-master, with grey hair streaming in the wind, bound his feet to\r\nthe cross-bars, and, stretching out his arms over his head, secured\r\nthem to the hammock-nettings above. He then retreated a little space,\r\nstanding silent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the boatswain stood solemnly on the other side, with a green\r\nbag in his hand, from which, taking four instruments of punishment, he\r\ngave one to each of his mates; for a fresh “cat” applied by a fresh\r\nhand, is the ceremonious privilege accorded to every man-of-war\r\nculprit.\r\n\r\nAt another sign from the Captain, the master-at-arms, stepping up,\r\nremoved the shirt from the prisoner. At this juncture a wave broke\r\nagainst the ship’s side, and clashed the spray over his exposed back.\r\nBut though the air was piercing cold, and the water drenched him, John\r\nstood still, without a shudder.\r\n\r\nThe Captain’s finger was now lifted, and the first boatswain’s-mate\r\nadvanced, combing out the nine tails of his _cat_ with his hand, and\r\nthen, sweeping them round his neck, brought them with the whole force\r\nof his body upon the mark. Again, and again, and again; and at every\r\nblow, higher and higher rose the long, purple bars on the prisoner’s\r\nback. But he only bowed over his head, and stood still. Meantime, some\r\nof the crew whispered among themselves in applause of their ship-mate’s\r\nnerve; but the greater part were breathlessly silent as the keen\r\nscourge hissed through the wintry air, and fell with a cutting, wiry\r\nsound upon the mark. One dozen lashes being applied, the man was taken\r\ndown, and went among the crew with a smile, saying, “D——n me! it’s\r\nnothing when you’re used to it! Who wants to fight?”\r\n\r\nThe next was Antone, the Portuguese. At every blow he surged from side\r\nto side, pouring out a torrent of involuntary blasphemies. Never before\r\nhad he been heard to curse. When cut down, he went among the men,\r\nswearing to have the life of the Captain. Of course, this was unheard\r\nby the officers.\r\n\r\nMark, the third prisoner, only cringed and coughed under his\r\npunishment. He had some pulmonary complaint. He was off duty for\r\nseveral days after the flogging; but this was partly to be imputed to\r\nhis extreme mental misery. It was his first scourging, and he felt the\r\ninsult more than the injury. He became silent and sullen for the rest\r\nof the cruise.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last was Peter, the mizzen-top lad. He had often boasted\r\nthat he had never been degraded at the gangway. The day before his\r\ncheek had worn its usual red but now no ghost was whiter. As he was\r\nbeing secured to the gratings, and the shudderings and creepings of his\r\ndazzlingly white back were revealed, he turned round his head\r\nimploringly; but his weeping entreaties and vows of contrition were of\r\nno avail. “I would not forgive God Almighty!” cried the Captain. The\r\nfourth boatswain’s-mate advanced, and at the first blow, the boy,\r\nshouting “_My God! Oh! my God!_” writhed and leaped so as to displace\r\nthe gratings, and scatter the nine tails of the scourge all over his\r\nperson. At the next blow he howled, leaped, and raged in unendurable\r\ntorture.\r\n\r\n“What are you stopping for, boatswain’s-mate?” cried the Captain. “Lay\r\non!” and the whole dozen was applied.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what happens to me now!” wept Peter, going among the\r\ncrew, with blood-shot eyes, as he put on his shirt. “I have been\r\nflogged once, and they may do it again, if they will. Let them look for\r\nme now!”\r\n\r\n“Pipe down!” cried the Captain, and the crew slowly dispersed.\r\n\r\nLet us have the charity to believe them—as we do—when some Captains in\r\nthe Navy say, that the thing of all others most repulsive to them, in\r\nthe routine of what they consider their duty, is the administration of\r\ncorporal punishment upon the crew; for, surely, not to feel scarified\r\nto the quick at these scenes would argue a man but a beast.\r\n\r\nYou see a human being, stripped like a slave; scourged worse than a\r\nhound. And for what? For things not essentially criminal, but only made\r\nso by arbitrary laws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\nSOME OF THE EVIL EFFECTS OF FLOGGING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are incidental considerations touching this matter of flogging,\r\nwhich exaggerate the evil into a great enormity. Many illustrations\r\nmight be given, but let us be content with a few.\r\n\r\nOne of the arguments advanced by officers of the Navy in favour of\r\ncorporal punishment is this: it can be inflicted in a moment; it\r\nconsumes no valuable time; and when the prisoner’s shirt is put on,\r\n_that_ is the last of it. Whereas, if another punishment were\r\nsubstituted, it would probably occasion a great waste of time and\r\ntrouble, besides thereby begetting in the sailor an undue idea of his\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nAbsurd, or worse than absurd, as it may appear, all this is true; and\r\nif you start from the same premises with these officers, you, must\r\nadmit that they advance an irresistible argument. But in accordance\r\nwith this principle, captains in the Navy, to a certain extent, inflict\r\nthe scourge—which is ever at hand—for nearly all degrees of\r\ntransgression. In offences not cognisable by a court-martial, little,\r\nif any, discrimination is shown. It is of a piece with the penal laws\r\nthat prevailed in England some sixty years ago, when one hundred and\r\nsixty different offences were declared by the statute-book to be\r\ncapital, and the servant-maid who but pilfered a watch was hung beside\r\nthe murderer of a family.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most common punishments for very trivial offences in\r\nthe Navy, to “stop” a seaman’s _grog_ for a day or a week. And as most\r\nseamen so cling to their _grog_, the loss of it is generally deemed by\r\nthem a very serious penalty. You will sometimes hear them say, “I would\r\nrather have my wind _stopped_ than _my grog!_”\r\n\r\nBut there are some sober seamen that would much rather draw the money\r\nfor it, instead of the grog itself, as provided by law; but they are\r\ntoo often deterred from this by the thought of receiving a scourging\r\nfor some inconsiderable offence, as a substitute for the stopping of\r\ntheir spirits. This is a most serious obstacle to the cause of\r\ntemperance in the Navy. But, in many cases, even the reluctant drawing\r\nof his grog cannot exempt a prudent seaman from ignominy; for besides\r\nthe formal administering of the “_cat_” at the gangway for petty\r\noffences, he is liable to the “colt,” or rope’s-end, a bit of\r\n_ratlin-stuff_, indiscriminately applied—without stripping the\r\nvictim—at any time, and in any part of the ship, at the merest wink\r\nfrom the Captain. By an express order of that officer, most boatswain’s\r\nmates carry the “colt” coiled in their hats, in readiness to be\r\nadministered at a minute’s warning upon any offender. This was the\r\ncustom in the Neversink. And until so recent a period as the\r\nadministration of President Polk, when the historian Bancroft,\r\nSecretary of the Navy, officially interposed, it was an almost\r\nuniversal thing for the officers of the watch, at their own discretion,\r\nto inflict chastisement upon a sailor, and this, too, in the face of\r\nthe ordinance restricting the power of flogging solely to Captains and\r\nCourts Martial. Nor was it a thing unknown for a Lieutenant, in a\r\nsudden outburst of passion, perhaps inflamed by brandy, or smarting\r\nunder the sense of being disliked or hated by the seamen, to order a\r\nwhole watch of two hundred and fifty men, at dead of night, to undergo\r\nthe indignity of the “colt.”\r\n\r\nIt is believed that, even at the present day, there are instances of\r\nCommanders still violating the law, by delegating the power of the colt\r\nto subordinates. At all events, it is certain that, almost to a man,\r\nthe Lieutenants in the Navy bitterly rail against the officiousness of\r\nBancroft, in so materially abridging their usurped functions by\r\nsnatching the colt from their hands. At the time, they predicted that\r\nthis rash and most ill-judged interference of the Secretary would end\r\nin the breaking up of all discipline in the Navy. But it has not so\r\nproved. These officers _now_ predict that, if the “cat” be abolished,\r\nthe same unfulfilled prediction would be verified.\r\n\r\nConcerning the license with which many captains violate the express\r\nlaws laid down by Congress for the government of the Navy, a glaring\r\ninstance may be quoted. For upward of forty years there has been on the\r\nAmerican Statute-book a law prohibiting a captain from inflicting, on\r\nhis own authority, more than twelve lashes at one time. If more are to\r\nbe given, the sentence must be passed by a Court-martial. Yet, for\r\nnearly half a century, this law has been frequently, and with almost\r\nperfect impunity, set at naught: though of late, through the exertions\r\nof Bancroft and others, it has been much better observed than formerly;\r\nindeed, at the present day, it is generally respected. Still, while the\r\nNeversink was lying in a South American port, on the cruise now written\r\nof, the seamen belonging to another American frigate informed us that\r\ntheir captain sometimes inflicted, upon his own authority, eighteen and\r\ntwenty lashes. It is worth while to state that this frigate was vastly\r\nadmired by the shore ladies for her wonderfully neat appearance. One of\r\nher forecastle-men told me that he had used up three jack-knives\r\n(charged to him on the books of the purser) in scraping the\r\nbelaying-pins and the combings of the hatchways.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that while the Lieutenants of the watch in American\r\nmen-of-war so long usurped the power of inflicting corporal punishment\r\nwith the _colt_, few or no similar abuses were known in the English\r\nNavy. And though the captain of an English armed ship is authorised to\r\ninflict, at his own discretion, _more_ than a dozen lashes (I think\r\nthree dozen), yet it is to be doubted whether, upon the whole, there is\r\nas much flogging at present in the English Navy as in the American. The\r\nchivalric Virginian, John Randolph of Roanoke, declared, in his place\r\nin Congress, that on board of the American man-of-war that carried him\r\nout Ambassador to Russia he had witnessed more flogging than had taken\r\nplace on his own plantation of five hundred African slaves in ten\r\nyears. Certain it is, from what I have personally seen, that the\r\nEnglish officers, as a general thing, seem to be less disliked by their\r\ncrews than the American officers by theirs. The reason probably is,\r\nthat many of them, from their station in life, have been more\r\naccustomed to social command; hence, quarter-deck authority sits more\r\nnaturally on them. A coarse, vulgar man, who happens to rise to high\r\nnaval rank by the exhibition of talents not incompatible with\r\nvulgarity, invariably proves a tyrant to his crew. It is a thing that\r\nAmerican men-of-war’s-men have often observed, that the Lieutenants\r\nfrom the Southern States, the descendants of the old Virginians, are\r\nmuch less severe, and much more gentle and gentlemanly in command, than\r\nthe Northern officers, as a class.\r\n\r\nAccording to the present laws and usages of the Navy, a seaman, for the\r\nmost trivial alleged offences, of which he may be entirely innocent,\r\nmust, without a trial, undergo a penalty the traces whereof he carries\r\nto the grave; for to a man-of-war’s-man’s experienced eye the marks of\r\na naval scourging with the “_cat_” are through life discernible. And\r\nwith these marks on his back, this image of his Creator must rise at\r\nthe Last Day. Yet so untouchable is true dignity, that there are cases\r\nwherein to be flogged at the gangway is no dishonour; though, to abase\r\nand hurl down the last pride of some sailor who has piqued him, be\r\nsome-times the secret motive, with some malicious officer, in procuring\r\nhim to be condemned to the lash. But this feeling of the innate dignity\r\nremaining untouched, though outwardly the body be scarred for the whole\r\nterm of the natural life, is one of the hushed things, buried among the\r\nholiest privacies of the soul; a thing between a man’s God and himself;\r\nand for ever undiscernible by our fellow-men, who account _that_ a\r\ndegradation which seems so to the corporal eye. But what torments must\r\nthat seaman undergo who, while his back bleeds at the gangway, bleeds\r\nagonized drops of shame from his soul! Are we not justified in\r\nimmeasurably denouncing this thing? Join hands with me, then; and, in\r\nthe name of that Being in whose image the flogged sailor is made, let\r\nus demand of Legislators, by what right they dare profane what God\r\nhimself accounts sacred.\r\n\r\nIs it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman? asks the\r\nintrepid Apostle, well knowing, as a Roman citizen, that it was not.\r\nAnd now, eighteen hundred years after, is it lawful for you, my\r\ncountrymen, to scourge a man that is an American? to scourge him round\r\nthe world in your frigates?\r\n\r\nIt is to no purpose that you apologetically appeal to the general\r\ndepravity of the man-of-war’s-man. Depravity in the oppressed is no\r\napology for the oppressor; but rather an additional stigma to him, as\r\nbeing, in a large degree, the effect, and not the cause and\r\njustification of oppression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\nFLOGGING NOT LAWFUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is next to idle, at the present day, merely to denounce an iniquity.\r\nBe ours, then, a different task.\r\n\r\nIf there are any three things opposed to the genius of the American\r\nConstitution, they are these: irresponsibility in a judge, unlimited\r\ndiscretionary authority in an executive, and the union of an\r\nirresponsible judge and an unlimited executive in one person.\r\n\r\nYet by virtue of an enactment of Congress, all the Commodores in the\r\nAmerican navy are obnoxious to these three charges, so far as concerns\r\nthe punishment of the sailor for alleged misdemeanors not particularly\r\nset forth in the Articles of War.\r\n\r\nHere is the enactment in question.\r\n\r\nXXXII. _Of the Articles of War_.—“All crimes committed by persons\r\nbelonging to the Navy, which are not specified in the foregoing\r\narticles, shall be punished according to the laws and customs in such\r\ncases at sea.”\r\n\r\nThis is the article that, above all others, puts the scourge into the\r\nhands of the Captain, calls him to no account for its exercise, and\r\nfurnishes him with an ample warrant for inflictions of cruelty upon the\r\ncommon sailor, hardly credible to landsmen.\r\n\r\nBy this article the Captain is made a legislator, as well as a judge\r\nand an executive. So far as it goes, it absolutely leaves to his\r\ndiscretion to decide what things shall be considered crimes, and what\r\nshall be the penalty; whether an accused person has been guilty of\r\nactions by him declared to be crimes; and how, when, and where the\r\npenalty shall be inflicted.\r\n\r\nIn the American Navy there is an everlasting suspension of the Habeas\r\nCorpus. Upon the bare allegation of misconduct there is no law to\r\nrestrain the Captain from imprisoning a seaman, and keeping him\r\nconfined at his pleasure. While I was in the Neversink, the Captain of\r\nan American sloop of war, from undoubted motives of personal pique,\r\nkept a seaman confined in the brig for upward of a month.\r\n\r\nCertainly the necessities of navies warrant a code for their government\r\nmore stringent than the law that governs the land; but that code should\r\nconform to the spirit of the political institutions of the country that\r\nordains it. It should not convert into slaves some of the citizens of a\r\nnation of free-men. Such objections cannot be urged against the laws of\r\nthe Russian navy (not essentially different from our own), because the\r\nlaws of that navy, creating the absolute one-man power in the Captain,\r\nand vesting in him the authority to scourge, conform in spirit to the\r\nterritorial laws of Russia, which is ruled by an autocrat, and whose\r\ncourts inflict the _knout_ upon the subjects of the land. But with us\r\nit is different. Our institutions claim to be based upon broad\r\nprinciples of political liberty and equality. Whereas, it would hardly\r\naffect one iota the condition on shipboard of an American\r\nman-of-war’s-man, were he transferred to the Russian navy and made a\r\nsubject of the Czar.\r\n\r\nAs a sailor, he shares none of our civil immunities; the law of our\r\nsoil in no respect accompanies the national floating timbers grown\r\nthereon, and to which he clings as his home. For him our Revolution was\r\nin vain; to him our Declaration of Independence is a lie.\r\n\r\nIt is not sufficiently borne in mind, perhaps, that though the naval\r\ncode comes under the head of the martial law, yet, in time of peace,\r\nand in the thousand questions arising between man and man on board\r\nship, this code, to a certain extent, may not improperly be deemed\r\nmunicipal. With its crew of 800 or 1,000 men, a three-decker is a city\r\non the sea. But in most of these matters between man and man, the\r\nCaptain instead of being a magistrate, dispensing what the law\r\npromulgates, is an absolute ruler, making and unmaking law as he\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the XXth of the Articles of War provides, that if\r\nany person in the Navy negligently perform the duties assigned him, he\r\nshall suffer such punishment as a court-martial shall adjudge; but if\r\nthe offender be a private (common sailor) he may, at the discretion of\r\nthe Captain, be put in irons or flogged. It is needless to say, that in\r\ncases where an officer commits a trivial violation of this law, a\r\ncourt-martial is seldom or never called to sit upon his trial; but in\r\nthe sailor’s case, he is at once condemned to the lash. Thus, one set\r\nof sea-citizens is exempted from a law that is hung in terror over\r\nothers. What would landsmen think, were the State of New York to pass a\r\nlaw against some offence, affixing a fine as a penalty, and then add to\r\nthat law a section restricting its penal operation to mechanics and day\r\nlaborers, exempting all gentlemen with an income of one thousand\r\ndollars? Yet thus, in the spirit of its practical operation, even thus,\r\nstands a good part of the naval laws wherein naval flogging is\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nBut a law should be “universal,” and include in its possible penal\r\noperations the very judge himself who gives decisions upon it; nay, the\r\nvery judge who expounds it. Had Sir William Blackstone violated the\r\nlaws of England, he would have been brought before the bar over which\r\nhe had presided, and would there have been tried, with the counsel for\r\nthe crown reading to him, perhaps, from a copy of his own\r\n_Commentaries_. And should he have been found guilty, he would have\r\nsuffered like the meanest subject, “according to law.”\r\n\r\nHow is it in an American frigate? Let one example suffice. By the\r\nArticles of War, and especially by Article I., an American Captain may,\r\nand frequently does, inflict a severe and degrading punishment upon a\r\nsailor, while he himself is for ever removed from the possibility of\r\nundergoing the like disgrace; and, in all probability, from undergoing\r\nany punishment whatever, even if guilty of the same thing—contention\r\nwith his equals, for instance—for which he punishes another. Yet both\r\nsailor and captain are American citizens.\r\n\r\nNow, in the language of Blackstone, again, there is a law, “coeval with\r\nmankind, dictated by God himself, superior in obligation to any other,\r\nand no human laws are of any validity if contrary to this.” That law is\r\nthe Law of Nature; among the three great principles of which Justinian\r\nincludes “that to every man should be rendered his due.” But we have\r\nseen that the laws involving flogging in the Navy do _not_ render to\r\nevery man his due, since in some cases they indirectly exclude the\r\nofficers from any punishment whatever, and in all cases protect them\r\nfrom the scourge, which is inflicted upon the sailor. Therefore,\r\naccording to Blackstone and Justinian, those laws have no binding\r\nforce; and every American man-of-war’s-man would be morally justified\r\nin resisting the scourge to the uttermost; and, in so resisting, would\r\nbe religiously justified in what would be judicially styled “the act of\r\nmutiny” itself.\r\n\r\nIf, then, these scourging laws be for any reason necessary, make them\r\nbinding upon all who of right come under their sway; and let us see an\r\nhonest Commodore, duly authorised by Congress, condemning to the lash a\r\ntransgressing Captain by the side of a transgressing sailor. And if the\r\nCommodore himself prove a transgressor, let us see one of his brother\r\nCommodores take up the lash against _him_, even as the boatswain’s\r\nmates, the navy executioners, are often called upon to scourge each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOr will you say that a navy officer is a man, but that an American-born\r\ncitizen, whose grandsire may have ennobled him by pouring out his blood\r\nat Bunker Hill—will you say that, by entering the service of his\r\ncountry as a common seaman, and standing ready to fight her foes, he\r\nthereby loses his manhood at the very time he most asserts it? Will you\r\nsay that, by so doing, he degrades himself to the liability of the\r\nscourge, but if he tarries ashore in time of danger, he is safe from\r\nthat indignity? All our linked states, all four continents of mankind,\r\nunite in denouncing such a thought.\r\n\r\nWe plant the question, then, on the topmost argument of all.\r\nIrrespective of incidental considerations, we assert that flogging in\r\nthe navy is opposed to the essential dignity, of man, which no\r\nlegislator has a right to violate; that it is oppressive, and glaringly\r\nunequal in its operations; that it is utterly repugnant to the spirit\r\nof our democratic institutions; indeed, that it involves a lingering\r\ntrait of the worst times of a barbarous feudal aristocracy; in a word,\r\nwe denounce it as religiously, morally, and immutably _wrong_.\r\n\r\nNo matter, then, what may be the consequences of its abolition; no\r\nmatter if we have to dismantle our fleets, and our unprotected commerce\r\nshould fall a prey to the spoiler, the awful admonitions of justice and\r\nhumanity demand that abolition without procrastination; in a voice that\r\nis not to be mistaken, demand that abolition today. It is not a\r\ndollar-and-cent question of expediency; it is a matter of _right and\r\nwrong_. And if any man can lay his hand on his heart, and solemnly say\r\nthat this scourging is right, let that man but once feel the lash on\r\nhis own back, and in his agony you will hear the apostate call the\r\nseventh heavens to witness that it is _wrong_. And, in the name of\r\nimmortal manhood, would to God that every man who upholds this thing\r\nwere scourged at the gangway till he recanted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\nFLOGGING NOT NECESSARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut White-Jacket is ready to come down from the lofty mast-head of an\r\neternal principle, and fight you—Commodores and Captains of the navy—on\r\nyour own quarter-deck, with your own weapons, at your own paces.\r\n\r\nExempt yourselves from the lash, you take Bible oaths to it that it is\r\nindispensable for others; you swear that, without the lash, no armed\r\nship can be kept in suitable discipline. Be it proved to you, officers,\r\nand stamped upon your foreheads, that herein you are utterly wrong.\r\n\r\n“Send them to Collingwood,” said Lord Nelson, “and _he_ will bring them\r\nto order.” This was the language of that renowned Admiral, when his\r\nofficers reported to him certain seamen of the fleet as wholly\r\nungovernable. “Send them to Collingwood.” And who was Collingwood,\r\nthat, after these navy rebels had been imprisoned and scourged without\r\nbeing brought to order, Collingwood could convert them to docility?\r\n\r\nWho Admiral Collinngwood was, as an historical hero, history herself\r\nwill tell you; nor, in whatever triumphal hall they may be hanging,\r\nwill the captured flags of Trafalgar fail to rustle at the mention of\r\nthat name. But what Collingwood was as a disciplinarian on board the\r\nships he commanded perhaps needs to be said. He was an officer, then,\r\nwho held in abhorrence all corporal punishment; who, though seeing more\r\nactive service than any sea-officer of his time, yet, for years\r\ntogether, governed his men without inflicting the lash.\r\n\r\nBut these seaman of his must have been most exemplary saints to have\r\nproved docile under so lenient a sway. Were they saints? Answer, ye\r\njails and alms-houses throughout the length and breadth of Great\r\nBritain, which, in Collingwood’s time, were swept clean of the last\r\nlingering villain and pauper to man his majesty’s fleets.\r\n\r\nStill more, _that_ was a period when the uttermost resources of England\r\nwere taxed to the quick; when the masts of her multiplied fleets almost\r\ntransplanted her forests, all standing to the sea; when British\r\npress-gangs not only boarded foreign ships on the high seas, and\r\nboarded foreign pier-heads, but boarded their own merchantmen at the\r\nmouth of the Thames, and boarded the very fire-sides along its banks;\r\nwhen Englishmen were knocked down and dragged into the navy, like\r\ncattle into the slaughter-house, with every mortal provocation to a mad\r\ndesperation against the service that thus ran their unwilling heads\r\ninto the muzzles of the enemy’s cannon. _This_ was the time, and\r\n_these_ the men that Collingwood governed without the lash.\r\n\r\nI know it has been said that Lord Collingwood began by inflicting\r\nsevere punishments, and afterward ruling his sailors by the mere memory\r\nof a by-gone terror, which he could at pleasure revive; and that his\r\nsailors knew this, and hence their good behaviour under a lenient sway.\r\nBut, granting the quoted assertion to be true, how comes it that many\r\nAmerican Captains, who, after inflicting as severe punishment as ever\r\nCollingwood could have authorized—how comes it that _they_, also, have\r\nnot been able to maintain good order without subsequent floggings,\r\nafter once showing to the crew with what terrible attributes they were\r\ninvested? But it is notorious, and a thing that I myself, in several\r\ninstances, _know_ to have been the case, that in the American navy,\r\nwhere corporal punishment has been most severe, it has also been most\r\nfrequent.\r\n\r\nBut it is incredible that, with such crews as Lord\r\nCollingwood’s—composed, in part, of the most desperate characters, the\r\nrakings of the jails—it is incredible that such a set of men could have\r\nbeen governed by the mere _memory_ of the lash. Some other influence\r\nmust have been brought to bear; mainly, no doubt, the influence wrought\r\nby a powerful brain, and a determined, intrepid spirit over a\r\nmiscellaneous rabble.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Lord Nelson himself, in point of policy, was\r\naverse to flogging; and that, too, when he had witnessed the mutinous\r\neffects of government abuses in the navy—unknown in our times—and\r\nwhich, to the terror of all England, developed themselves at the great\r\nmutiny of the Nore: an outbreak that for several weeks jeopardised the\r\nvery existence of the British navy.\r\n\r\nBut we may press this thing nearly two centuries further back, for it\r\nis a matter of historical doubt whether, in Robert Blake’s time,\r\nCromwell’s great admiral, such a thing as flogging was known at the\r\ngangways of his victorious fleets. And as in this matter we cannot go\r\nfurther back than to Blake, so we cannot advance further than to our\r\nown time, which shows Commodore Stockton, during the recent war with\r\nMexico, governing the American squadron in the Pacific without\r\nemploying the scourge.\r\n\r\nBut if of three famous English Admirals one has abhorred flogging,\r\nanother almost governed his ships without it, and to the third it may\r\nbe supposed to have been unknown, while an American Commander has,\r\nwithin the present year almost, been enabled to sustain the good\r\ndiscipline of an entire squadron in time of war without having an\r\ninstrument of scourging on board, what inevitable inferences must be\r\ndrawn, and how disastrous to the mental character of all advocates of\r\nnavy flogging, who may happen to be navy officers themselves.\r\n\r\nIt cannot have escaped the discernment of any observer of mankind,\r\nthat, in the presence of its conventional inferiors, conscious\r\nimbecility in power often seeks to carry off that imbecility by\r\nassumptions of lordly severity. The amount of flogging on board an\r\nAmerican man-of-war is, in many cases, in exact proportion to the\r\nprofessional and intellectual incapacity of her officers to command.\r\nThus, in these cases, the law that authorises flogging does but put a\r\nscourge into the hand of a fool. In most calamitous instances this has\r\nbeen shown.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of record, that some English ships of war have fallen a\r\nprey to the enemy through the insubordination of the crew, induced by\r\nthe witless cruelty of their officers; officers so armed by the law\r\nthat they could inflict that cruelty without restraint. Nor have there\r\nbeen wanting instances where the seamen have ran away with their ships,\r\nas in the case of the Hermione and Danae, and forever rid themselves of\r\nthe outrageous inflictions of their officers by sacrificing their lives\r\nto their fury.\r\n\r\nEvents like these aroused the attention of the British public at the\r\ntime. But it was a tender theme, the public agitation of which the\r\ngovernment was anxious to suppress. Nevertheless, whenever the thing\r\nwas privately discussed, these terrific mutinies, together with the\r\nthen prevailing insubordination of the men in the navy, were almost\r\nuniversally attributed to the exasperating system of flogging. And the\r\nnecessity for flogging was generally believed to be directly referable\r\nto the impressment of such crowds of dissatisfied men. And in high\r\nquarters it was held that if, by any mode, the English fleet could be\r\nmanned without resource to coercive measures, then the necessity of\r\nflogging would cease.\r\n\r\n“If we abolish either impressment or flogging, the abolition of the\r\nother will follow as a matter of course.” This was the language of the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, at a still later period, 1824.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the necessity of flogging in the British armed marine was\r\nsolely attributed to the impressment of the seamen, what faintest\r\nshadow of reason is there for the continuance of this barbarity in the\r\nAmerican service, which is wholly freed from the reproach of\r\nimpressment?\r\n\r\nIt is true that, during a long period of non-impressment, and even down\r\nto the present day, flogging has been, and still is, the law of the\r\nEnglish navy. But in things of this kind England should be nothing to\r\nus, except an example to be shunned. Nor should wise legislators wholly\r\ngovern themselves by precedents, and conclude that, since scourging has\r\nso long prevailed, some virtue must reside in it. Not so. The world has\r\narrived at a period which renders it the part of Wisdom to pay homage\r\nto the prospective precedents of the Future in preference to those of\r\nthe Past. The Past is dead, and has no resurrection; but the Future is\r\nendowed with such a life, that it lives to us even in anticipation. The\r\nPast is, in many things, the foe of mankind; the Future is, in all\r\nthings, our friend. In the Past is no hope; the Future is both hope and\r\nfruition. The Past is the text-book of tyrants; the Future the Bible of\r\nthe Free. Those who are solely governed by the Past stand like Lot’s\r\nwife, crystallised in the act of looking backward, and forever\r\nincapable of looking before.\r\n\r\nLet us leave the Past, then, to dictate laws to immovable China; let us\r\nabandon it to the Chinese Legitimists of Europe. But for us, we will\r\nhave another captain to rule over us—that captain who ever marches at\r\nthe head of his troop and beckons them forward, not lingering in the\r\nrear, and impeding their march with lumbering baggage-wagons of old\r\nprecedents. _This_ is the Past.\r\n\r\nBut in many things we Americans are driven to a rejection of the maxims\r\nof the Past, seeing that, ere long, the van of the nations must, of\r\nright, belong to ourselves. There are occasions when it is for America\r\nto make precedents, and not to obey them. We should, if possible, prove\r\na teacher to posterity, instead of being the pupil of by-gone\r\ngenerations. More shall come after us than have gone before; the world\r\nis not yet middle-aged.\r\n\r\nEscaped from the house of bondage, Israel of old did not follow after\r\nthe ways of the Egyptians. To her was given an express dispensation; to\r\nher were given new things under the sun. And we Americans are the\r\npeculiar, chosen people—the Israel of our time; we bear the ark of the\r\nliberties of the world. Seventy years ago we escaped from thrall; and,\r\nbesides our first birthright—embracing one continent of earth—God has\r\ngiven to us, for a future inheritance, the broad domains of the\r\npolitical pagans, that shall yet come and lie down under the shade of\r\nour ark, without bloody hands being lifted. God has predestinated,\r\nmankind expects, great things from our race; and great things we feel\r\nin our souls. The rest of the nations must soon be in our rear. We are\r\nthe pioneers of the world; the advance-guard, sent on through the\r\nwilderness of untried things, to break a new path in the New World that\r\nis ours. In our youth is our strength; in our inexperience, our wisdom.\r\nAt a period when other nations have but lisped, our deep voice is heard\r\nafar. Long enough, have we been skeptics with regard to ourselves, and\r\ndoubted whether, indeed, the political Messiah had come. But he has\r\ncome in us, if we would but give utterance to his promptings. And let\r\nus always remember that with ourselves, almost for the first time in\r\nthe history of earth, national selfishness is unbounded philanthropy;\r\nfor we can not do a good to America but we give alms to the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\nSOME SUPERIOR OLD “LONDON DOCK” FROM THE WINE-COOLERS OF NEPTUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had just slid into pleasant weather, drawing near to the Tropics,\r\nwhen all hands were thrown into a wonderful excitement by an event that\r\neloquently appealed to many palates.\r\n\r\nA man at the fore-top-sail-yard sung out that there were eight or ten\r\ndark objects floating on the sea, some three points off our lee-bow.\r\n\r\n“Keep her off three points!” cried Captain Claret, to the\r\nquarter-master at the _cun_.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, with all our batteries, store-rooms, and five hundred men,\r\nwith their baggage, and beds, and provisions, at one move of a round\r\nbit of mahogany, our great-embattled ark edged away for the strangers,\r\nas easily as a boy turns to the right or left in pursuit of insects in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nDirectly the man on the top-sail-yard reported the dark objects to be\r\nhogsheads. Instantly all the top-men were straining their eyes, in\r\ndelirious expectation of having their long _grog fast_ broken at last,\r\nand that, too, by what seemed an almost miraculous intervention. It was\r\na curious circumstance that, without knowing the contents of the\r\nhogsheads, they yet seemed certain that the staves encompassed the\r\nthing they longed for.\r\n\r\nSail was now shortened, our headway was stopped, and a cutter was\r\nlowered, with orders to tow the fleet of strangers alongside. The men\r\nsprang to their oars with a will, and soon five goodly puncheons lay\r\nwallowing in the sea, just under the main-chains. We got overboard the\r\nslings, and hoisted them out of the water.\r\n\r\nIt was a sight that Bacchus and his bacchanals would have gloated over.\r\nEach puncheon was of a deep-green color, so covered with minute\r\nbarnacles and shell-fish, and streaming with sea-weed, that it needed\r\nlong searching to find out their bung-holes; they looked like venerable\r\nold _loggerhead-turtles._ How long they had been tossing about, and\r\nmaking voyages for the benefit of the flavour of their contents, no one\r\ncould tell. In trying to raft them ashore, or on board of some\r\nmerchant-ship, they must have drifted off to sea. This we inferred from\r\nthe ropes that length-wise united them, and which, from one point of\r\nview, made them resemble a long sea-serpent. They were _struck_ into\r\nthe gun-deck, where, the eager crowd being kept off by sentries, the\r\ncooper was called with his tools.\r\n\r\n“Bung up, and bilge free!” he cried, in an ecstasy, flourishing his\r\ndriver and hammer.\r\n\r\nUpon clearing away the barnacles and moss, a flat sort of shell-fish\r\nwas found, closely adhering, like a California-shell, right over one of\r\nthe bungs. Doubtless this shell-fish had there taken up his quarters,\r\nand thrown his own body into the breach, in order the better to\r\npreserve the precious contents of the cask. The by-standers were\r\nbreathless, when at last this puncheon was canted over and a tin-pot\r\nheld to the orifice. What was to come forth? salt-water or wine? But a\r\nrich purple tide soon settled the question, and the lieutenant assigned\r\nto taste it, with a loud and satisfactory smack of his lips, pronounced\r\nit Port!\r\n\r\n“Oporto!” cried Mad Jack, “and no mistake!”\r\n\r\nBut, to the surprise, grief, and consternation of the sailors, an order\r\nnow came from the quarter-deck to strike the “strangers down into the\r\nmain-hold!” This proceeding occasioned all sorts of censorious\r\nobservations upon the Captain, who, of course, had authorised it.\r\n\r\nIt must be related here that, on the passage out from home, the\r\nNeversink had touched at Madeira; and there, as is often the case with\r\nmen-of-war, the Commodore and Captain had laid in a goodly stock of\r\nwines for their own private tables, and the benefit of their foreign\r\nvisitors. And although the Commodore was a small, spare man, who\r\nevidently emptied but few glasses, yet Captain Claret was a portly\r\ngentleman, with a crimson face, whose father had fought at the battle\r\nof the Brandywine, and whose brother had commanded the well-known\r\nfrigate named in honour of that engagement. And his whole appearance\r\nevinced that Captain Claret himself had fought many Brandywine battles\r\nashore in honour of his sire’s memory, and commanded in many bloodless\r\nBrandywine actions at sea.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore with some savour of provocation that the sailors held\r\nforth on the ungenerous conduct of Captain Claret, in stepping in\r\nbetween them and Providence, as it were, which by this lucky windfall,\r\nthey held, seemed bent upon relieving their necessities; while Captain\r\nClaret himself, with an inexhaustible cellar, emptied his Madeira\r\ndecanters at his leisure.\r\n\r\nBut next day all hands were electrified by the old familiar sound—so\r\nlong hushed—of the drum rolling to grog.\r\n\r\nAfter that the port was served out twice a day, till all was expended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\nTHE CHAPLAIN AND CHAPEL IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday; a fact set down in the almanac, spite of\r\nmerchant seamen’s maxim, that _there are no Sundays of soundings_.\r\n\r\n_No Sundays off soundings,_ indeed! No Sundays on shipboard! You may as\r\nwell say there should be no Sundays in churches; for is not a ship\r\nmodeled after a church? has it not three spires—three steeples? yea,\r\nand on the gun-deck, a bell and a belfry? And does not that bell\r\nmerrily peal every Sunday morning, to summon the crew to devotions?\r\n\r\nAt any rate, there were Sundays on board this particular frigate of\r\nours, and a clergyman also. He was a slender, middle-aged man, of an\r\namiable deportment and irreproachable conversation; but I must say,\r\nthat his sermons were but ill calculated to benefit the crew. He had\r\ndrank at the mystic fountain of Plato; his head had been turned by the\r\nGermans; and this I will say, that White-Jacket himself saw him with\r\nColeridge’s Biographia Literaria in his hand.\r\n\r\nFancy, now, this transcendental divine standing behind a gun-carriage\r\non the main-deck, and addressing five hundred salt-sea sinners upon the\r\npsychological phenomena of the soul, and the ontological necessity of\r\nevery sailor’s saving it at all hazards. He enlarged upon the follies\r\nof the ancient philosophers; learnedly alluded to the Phiedon of Plato;\r\nexposed the follies of Simplicius’s Commentary on Aristotle’s “De\r\nCoelo,” by arraying against that clever Pagan author the admired tract\r\nof Tertullian—_De Prascriptionibus Haereticorum_—and concluded by a\r\nSanscrit invocation. He was particularly hard upon the Gnostics and\r\nMarcionites of the second century of the Christian era; but he never,\r\nin the remotest manner, attacked the everyday vices of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, as eminently illustrated in our man-of-war world. Concerning\r\ndrunkenness, fighting, flogging, and oppression—things expressly or\r\nimpliedly prohibited by Christianity—he never said aught. But the most\r\nmighty Commodore and Captain sat before him; and in general, if, in a\r\nmonarchy, the state form the audience of the church, little evangelical\r\npiety will be preached. Hence, the harmless, non-committal abstrusities\r\nof our Chaplain were not to be wondered at. He was no Massillon, to\r\nthunder forth his ecclesiastical rhetoric, even when a Louis le Grand\r\nwas enthroned among his congregation. Nor did the chaplains who\r\npreached on the quarter-deck of Lord Nelson ever allude to the guilty\r\nFelix, nor to Delilah, nor practically reason of righteousness,\r\ntemperance, and judgment to come, when that renowned Admiral sat,\r\nsword-belted, before them.\r\n\r\nDuring these Sunday discourses, the officers always sat in a circle\r\nround the Chaplain, and, with a business-like air, steadily preserved\r\nthe utmost propriety. In particular, our old Commodore himself made a\r\npoint of looking intensely edified; and not a sailor on board but\r\nbelieved that the Commodore, being the greatest man present, must alone\r\ncomprehend the mystic sentences that fell from our parson’s lips.\r\n\r\nOf all the noble lords in the ward-room, this lord-spiritual, with the\r\nexception of the Purser, was in the highest favour with the Commodore,\r\nwho frequently conversed with him in a close and confidential manner.\r\nNor, upon reflection, was this to be marvelled at, seeing how\r\nefficacious, in all despotic governments, it is for the throne and\r\naltar to go hand-in-hand.\r\n\r\nThe accommodations of our chapel were very poor. We had nothing to sit\r\non but the great gun-rammers and capstan-bars, placed horizontally upon\r\nshot-boxes. These seats were exceedingly uncomfortable, wearing out our\r\ntrowsers and our tempers, and, no doubt, impeded the con-version of\r\nmany valuable souls.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth, men-of-war’s-men, in general, make but poor auditors\r\nupon these occasions, and adopt every possible means to elude them.\r\nOften the boatswain’s-mates were obliged to drive the men to service,\r\nviolently swearing upon these occasions, as upon every other.\r\n\r\n“Go to prayers, d——n you! To prayers, you rascals—to prayers!” In this\r\nclerical invitation Captain Claret would frequently unite.\r\n\r\nAt this Jack Chase would sometimes make merry. “Come, boys, don’t hang\r\nback,” he would say; “come, let us go hear the parson talk about his\r\nLord High Admiral Plato, and Commodore Socrates.”\r\n\r\nBut, in one instance, grave exception was taken to this summons. A\r\nremarkably serious, but bigoted seaman, a sheet-anchor-man—whose\r\nprivate devotions may hereafter be alluded to—once touched his hat to\r\nthe Captain, and respectfully said, “Sir, I am a Baptist; the chaplain\r\nis an Episcopalian; his form of worship is not mine; I do not believe\r\nwith him, and it is against my conscience to be under his ministry. May\r\nI be allowed, sir, _not_ to attend service on the half-deck?”\r\n\r\n“You will be allowed, sir!” said the Captain, haughtily, “to obey the\r\nlaws of the ship. If you absent yourself from prayers on Sunday\r\nmornings, you know the penalty.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the Articles of War, the Captain was perfectly right; but\r\nif any law requiring an American to attend divine service against his\r\nwill be a law respecting the establishment of religion, then the\r\nArticles of War are, in this one particular, opposed to the American\r\nConstitution, which expressly says, “Congress shall make no law\r\nrespecting the establishment of religion, or the free exercise\r\nthereof.” But this is only one of several things in which the Articles\r\nof War are repugnant to that instrument. They will be glanced at in\r\nanother part of the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe motive which prompts the introduction of chaplains into the Navy\r\ncannot but be warmly responded to by every Christian. But it does not\r\nfollow, that because chaplains are to be found in men-of-war, that,\r\nunder the present system, they achieve much good, or that, under any\r\nother, they ever will.\r\n\r\nHow can it be expected that the religion of peace should flourish in an\r\noaken castle of war? How can it be expected that the clergyman, whose\r\npulpit is a forty-two-pounder, should convert sinners to a faith that\r\nenjoins them to turn the right cheek when the left is smitten? How is\r\nit to be expected that when, according to the XLII. of the Articles of\r\nWar, as they now stand unrepealed on the Statute-book, “a bounty shall\r\nbe paid” (to the officers and crew) “by the United States government of\r\n$20 for each person on board any ship of an enemy which shall be sunk\r\nor destroyed by any United States ship;” and when, by a subsequent\r\nsection (vii.), it is provided, among other apportionings, that the\r\nchaplain shall receive “two twentieths” of this price paid for sinking\r\nand destroying ships full of human beings? How is it to be expected\r\nthat a clergyman, thus provided for, should prove efficacious in\r\nenlarging upon the criminality of Judas, who, for thirty pieces of\r\nsilver, betrayed his Master?\r\n\r\nAlthough, by the regulations of the Navy, each seaman’s mess on board\r\nthe _Neversink_ was furnished with a Bible, these Bibles were seldom or\r\nnever to be seen, except on Sunday mornings, when usage demands that\r\nthey shall be exhibited by the cooks of the messes, when the\r\nmaster-at-arms goes his rounds on the berth-deck. At such times, they\r\nusually surmounted a highly-polished tin-pot placed on the lid of the\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nYet, for all this, the Christianity of men-of-war’s men, and their\r\ndisposition to contribute to pious enterprises, are often relied upon.\r\nSeveral times subscription papers were circulated among the crew of the\r\nNeversink, while in harbour, under the direct patronage of the\r\nChaplain. One was for the purpose of building a seaman’s chapel in\r\nChina; another to pay the salary of a tract-distributor in Greece; a\r\nthird to raise a fund for the benefit of an African Colonization\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nWhere the Captain himself is a moral man, he makes a far better\r\nchaplain for his crew than any clergyman can be. This is sometimes\r\nillustrated in the case of sloops of war and armed brigs, which are not\r\nallowed a regular chaplain. I have known one crew, who were warmly\r\nattached to a naval commander worthy of their love, who have mustered\r\neven with alacrity to the call to prayer; and when their Captain would\r\nread the Church of England service to them, would present a\r\ncongregation not to be surpassed for earnestness and devotion by any\r\nScottish Kirk. It seemed like family devotions, where the head of the\r\nhouse is foremost in confessing himself before his Maker. But our own\r\nhearts are our best prayer-rooms, and the chaplains who can most help\r\nus are ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\nTHE FRIGATE IN HARBOUR.—THE BOATS.—GRAND STATE RECEPTION OF THE\r\nCOMMODORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn good time we were up with the parallel of Rio de Janeiro, and,\r\nstanding in for the land, the mist soon cleared; and high aloft the\r\nfamed Sugar Loaf pinnacle was seen, our bowsprit pointing for it\r\nstraight as a die.\r\n\r\nAs we glided on toward our anchorage, the bands of the various\r\nmen-of-war in harbour saluted us with national airs, and gallantly\r\nlowered their ensigns. Nothing can exceed the courteous etiquette of\r\nthese ships, of all nations, in greeting their brethren. Of all men,\r\nyour accomplished duellist is generally the most polite.\r\n\r\nWe lay in Rio some weeks, lazily taking in stores and otherwise\r\npreparing for the passage home. But though Rio is one of the most\r\nmagnificent bays in the world; though the city itself contains many\r\nstriking objects; and though much might be said of the Sugar Loaf and\r\nSignal Hill heights; and the little islet of Lucia; and the fortified\r\nIhla Dos Cobras, or Isle of the Snakes (though the only anacondas and\r\nadders now found in the arsenals there are great guns and pistols); and\r\nLord Wood’s Nose—a lofty eminence said by seamen to resemble his\r\nlordship’s conch-shell; and the Prays do Flamingo—a noble tract of\r\nbeach, so called from its having been the resort, in olden times, of\r\nthose gorgeous birds; and the charming Bay of Botofogo, which, spite of\r\nits name, is fragrant as the neighbouring Larangieros, or Valley of the\r\nOranges; and the green Gloria Hill, surmounted by the belfries of the\r\nqueenly Church of Nossa Senora de Gloria; and the iron-gray Benedictine\r\nconvent near by; and the fine drive and promenade, Passeo Publico; and\r\nthe massive arch-over-arch aqueduct, Arcos de Carico; and the Emperor’s\r\nPalace; and the Empress’s Gardens; and the fine Church de Candelaria;\r\nand the gilded throne on wheels, drawn by eight silken, silver-belled\r\nmules, in which, of pleasant evenings, his Imperial Majesty is driven\r\nout of town to his Moorish villa of St. Christova—ay, though much might\r\nbe said of all this, yet must I forbear, if I may, and adhere to my one\r\nproper object, _the world in a man-of-war_.\r\n\r\nBehold, now, the Neversink under a new aspect. With all her batteries,\r\nshe is tranquilly lying in harbour, surrounded by English, French,\r\nDutch, Portuguese, and Brazilian seventy-fours, moored in the\r\ndeep-green water, close under the lee of that oblong, castellated mass\r\nof rock, Ilha Dos Cobras, which, with its port-holes and lofty\r\nflag-staffs, looks like another man-of-war, fast anchored in the way.\r\nBut what is an insular fortress, indeed, but an embattled land-slide\r\ninto the sea from the world Gibraltars and Quebecs? And what a\r\nmain-land fortress but a few decks of a line-of-battle ship\r\ntransplanted ashore? They are all one—all, as King David, men-of-war\r\nfrom their youth.\r\n\r\nAy, behold now the Neversink at her anchors, in many respects\r\npresenting a different appearance from what she presented at sea. Nor\r\nis the routine of life on board the same.\r\n\r\nAt sea there is more to employ the sailors, and less temptation to\r\nviolations of the law. Whereas, in port, unless some particular service\r\nengages them, they lead the laziest of lives, beset by all the\r\nallurements of the shore, though perhaps that shore they may never\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\nUnless you happen to belong to one of the numerous boats, which, in a\r\nman-of-war in harbour, are continually plying to and from the land, you\r\nare mostly thrown upon your own resources to while away the time. Whole\r\ndays frequently pass without your being individually called upon to\r\nlift a finger; for though, in the merchant-service, they make a point\r\nof keeping the men always busy about something or other, yet, to employ\r\nfive hundred sailors when there is nothing definite to be done wholly\r\nsurpasses the ingenuity of any First Lieutenant in the Navy.\r\n\r\nAs mention has just been made of the numerous boats employed in\r\nharbour, something more may as well be put down concerning them. Our\r\nfrigate carried a very large boat—as big as a small sloop—called a\r\n_launch_, which was generally used for getting off wood, water, and\r\nother bulky articles. Besides this, she carried four boats of an\r\narithmetical progression in point of size—the largest being known as\r\nthe first cutter, the next largest the second cutter, then the third\r\nand fourth cutters. She also carried a Commodore’s Barge, a Captain’s\r\nGig, and a “dingy,” a small yawl, with a crew of apprentice boys. All\r\nthese boats, except the “dingy,” had their regular crews, who were\r\nsubordinate to their cockswains—_petty officers_, receiving pay in\r\naddition to their seaman’s wages.\r\n\r\nThe _launch_ was manned by the old Tritons of the forecastle, who were\r\nno ways particular about their dress, while the other\r\nboats—commissioned for genteeler duties—were rowed by young follows,\r\nmostly, who had a dandy eye to their personal appearance. Above all,\r\nthe officers see to it that the Commodore’s Barge and the Captain’s Gig\r\nare manned by gentlemanly youths, who may do credit to their country,\r\nand form agreeable objects for the eyes of the Commodore or Captain to\r\nrepose upon as he tranquilly sits in the stern, when pulled ashore by\r\nhis barge-men or gig-men, as the case may be. Some sailors are very\r\nfond of belonging to the boats, and deem it a great honour to be a\r\n_Commodore’s barge-man_; but others, perceiving no particular\r\ndistinction in that office, do not court it so much.\r\n\r\nOn the second day after arriving at Rio, one of the gig-men fell sick,\r\nand, to my no small concern, I found myself temporarily appointed to\r\nhis place.\r\n\r\n“Come, White-Jacket, rig yourself in white—that’s the gig’s uniform\r\nto-day; you are a gig-man, my boy—give ye joy!” This was the first\r\nannouncement of the fact that I heard; but soon after it was officially\r\nratified.\r\n\r\nI was about to seek the First Lieutenant, and plead the scantiness of\r\nmy wardrobe, which wholly disqualified me to fill so distinguished a\r\nstation, when I heard the bugler call away the “gig;” and, without more\r\nado, I slipped into a clean frock, which a messmate doffed for my\r\nbenefit, and soon after found myself pulling off his High Mightiness,\r\nthe Captain, to an English seventy-four.\r\n\r\nAs we were bounding along, the cockswain suddenly cried “Oars!” At the\r\nword every oar was suspended in the air, while our Commodore’s barge\r\nfloated by, bearing that dignitary himself. At the sight, Captain\r\nClaret removed his chapeau, and saluted profoundly, our boat lying\r\nmotionless on the water. But the barge never stopped; and the Commodore\r\nmade but a slight return to the obsequious salute he had received.\r\n\r\nWe then resumed rowing, and presently I heard “Oars!” again; but from\r\nanother boat, the second cutter, which turned out to be carrying a\r\nLieutenant ashore. If was now Captain Claret’s turn to be honoured. The\r\ncutter lay still, and the Lieutenant off hat; while the Captain only\r\nnodded, and we kept on our way.\r\n\r\nThis naval etiquette is very much like the etiquette at the Grand Porte\r\nof Constantinople, where, after washing the Sublime Sultan’s feet, the\r\nGrand Vizier avenges himself on an Emir, who does the same office for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived aboard the English seventy-four, the Captain was\r\nreceived with the usual honours, and the gig’s crew were conducted\r\nbelow, and hospitably regaled with some spirits, served out by order of\r\nthe officer of the deck.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the English crew went to quarters; and as they stood up at\r\ntheir guns, all along the main-deck, a row of beef-fed Britons,\r\nstalwart-looking fellows, I was struck with the contrast they afforded\r\nto similar sights on board of the Neversink.\r\n\r\nFor on board of us our “_quarters_” showed an array of rather slender,\r\nlean-checked chaps. But then I made no doubt, that, in a sea-tussle,\r\nthese lantern-jawed varlets would have approved themselves as slender\r\nDamascus blades, nimble and flexible; whereas these Britons would have\r\nbeen, perhaps, as sturdy broadswords. Yet every one remembers that\r\nstory of Saladin and Richard trying their respective blades; how\r\ngallant Richard clove an anvil in twain, or something quite as\r\nponderous, and Saladin elegantly severed a cushion; so that the two\r\nmonarchs were even—each excelling in his way—though, unfortunately for\r\nmy simile, in a patriotic point of view, Richard whipped Saladin’s\r\narmies in the end.\r\n\r\nThere happened to be a lord on board of this ship—the younger son of an\r\nearl, they told me. He was a fine-looking fellow. I chanced to stand by\r\nwhen he put a question to an Irish captain of a gum; upon the seaman’s\r\ninadvertently saying sir to him, his lordship looked daggers at the\r\nslight; and the sailor touching his hat a thousand times, said,\r\n“Pardon, your honour; I meant to say _my lord_, sir!”\r\n\r\nI was much pleased with an old white-headed musician, who stood at the\r\nmain hatchway, with his enormous bass drum full before him, and\r\nthumping it sturdily to the tune of “God Save the King!” though small\r\nmercy did he have on his drum-heads. Two little boys were clashing\r\ncymbals, and another was blowing a fife, with his cheeks puffed out\r\nlike the plumpest of his country’s plum-puddings.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned from this trip, there again took place that\r\nceremonious reception of our captain on board the vessel he commanded,\r\nwhich always had struck me as exceedingly diverting.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, while in port, one of the quarter-masters is always\r\nstationed on the poop with a spy-glass, to look out for all boats\r\napproaching, and report the same to the officer of the deck; also, who\r\nit is that may be coming in them; so that preparations may be made\r\naccordingly. As soon, then, as the gig touched the side, a mighty\r\nshrill piping was heard, as if some boys were celebrating the Fourth of\r\nJuly with penny whistles. This proceeded from a boatswain’s mate, who,\r\nstanding at the gangway, was thus honouring the Captain’s return after\r\nhis long and perilous absence.\r\n\r\nThe Captain then slowly mounted the ladder, and gravely marching\r\nthrough a lane of “_side-boys_,” so called—all in their best bibs and\r\ntuckers, and who stood making sly faces behind his back—was received by\r\nall the Lieutenants in a body, their hats in their hands, and making a\r\nprodigious scraping and bowing, as if they had just graduated at a\r\nFrench dancing-school. Meanwhile, preserving an erect, inflexible, and\r\nram-rod carriage, and slightly touching his chapeau, the Captain made\r\nhis ceremonious way to the cabin, disappearing behind the scenes, like\r\nthe pasteboard ghost in Hamlet.\r\n\r\nBut these ceremonies are nothing to those in homage of the Commodore’s\r\narrival, even should he depart and arrive twenty times a day. Upon such\r\noccasions, the whole marine guard, except the sentries on duty, are\r\nmarshalled on the quarter-deck, presenting arms as the Commodore passes\r\nthem; while their commanding officer gives the military salute with his\r\nsword, as if making masonic signs. Meanwhile, the boatswain himself—not\r\na _boatswain’s mate_—is keeping up a persevering whistling with his\r\nsilver pipe; for the Commodore is never greeted with the rude whistle\r\nof a boatswain’s subaltern; _that_ would be positively insulting. All\r\nthe Lieutenants and Midshipmen, besides the Captain himself, are drawn\r\nup in a phalanx, and off hat together; and the _side-boys_, whose\r\nnumber is now increased to ten or twelve, make an imposing display at\r\nthe gangway; while the whole brass band, elevated upon the poop, strike\r\nup “See! the Conquering Hero Comes!” At least, this was the tune that\r\nour Captain always hinted, by a gesture, to the captain of the band,\r\nwhenever the Commodore arrived from shore.\r\n\r\nIt conveyed a complimentary appreciation, on the Captain’s part, of the\r\nCommodore’s heroism during the late war.\r\n\r\nTo return to the gig. As I did not relish the idea of being a sort of\r\nbody-servant to Captain Claret—since his gig-men were often called upon\r\nto scrub his cabin floor, and perform other duties for him—I made it my\r\nparticular business to get rid of my appointment in his boat as soon as\r\npossible, and the next day after receiving it, succeeded in procuring a\r\nsubstitute, who was glad of the chance to fill the position I so much\r\nundervalued.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, with our counterlikes and dislikes, most of us\r\nmen-of-war’s-men harmoniously dove-tail into each other, and, by our\r\nvery points of opposition, unite in a clever whole, like the parts of a\r\nChinese puzzle. But as, in a Chinese puzzle, many pieces are hard to\r\nplace, so there are some unfortunate fellows who can never slip into\r\ntheir proper angles, and thus the whole puzzle becomes a puzzle indeed,\r\nwhich is the precise condition of the greatest puzzle in the world—this\r\nman-of-war world itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\nSOME OF THE CEREMONIES IN A MAN-OF-WAR UNNECESSARY AND INJURIOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ceremonials of a man-of-war, some of which have been described in\r\nthe preceding chapter, may merit a reflection or two.\r\n\r\nThe general usages of the American Navy are founded upon the usages\r\nthat prevailed in the navy of monarchical England more than a century\r\nago; nor have they been materially altered since. And while both\r\nEngland and America have become greatly liberalised in the interval;\r\nwhile shore pomp in high places has come to be regarded by the more\r\nintelligent masses of men as belonging to the absurd, ridiculous, and\r\nmock-heroic; while that most truly august of all the majesties of\r\nearth, the President of the United States, may be seen entering his\r\nresidence with his umbrella under his arm, and no brass band or\r\nmilitary guard at his heels, and unostentatiously taking his seat by\r\nthe side of the meanest citizen in a public conveyance; while this is\r\nthe case, there still lingers in American men-of-war all the stilted\r\netiquette and childish parade of the old-fashioned Spanish court of\r\nMadrid. Indeed, so far as the things that meet the eye are concerned,\r\nan American Commodore is by far a greater man than the President of\r\ntwenty millions of freemen.\r\n\r\nBut we plain people ashore might very willingly be content to leave\r\nthese commodores in the unmolested possession of their gilded penny\r\nwhistles, rattles, and gewgaws, since they seem to take so much\r\npleasure in them, were it not that all this is attended by consequences\r\nto their subordinates in the last degree to be deplored.\r\n\r\nWhile hardly any one will question that a naval officer should be\r\nsurrounded by circumstances calculated to impart a requisite dignity to\r\nhis position, it is not the less certain that, by the excessive pomp he\r\nat present maintains, there is naturally and unavoidably generated a\r\nfeeling of servility and debasement in the hearts of most of the seamen\r\nwho continually behold a fellow-mortal flourishing over their heads\r\nlike the archangel Michael with a thousand wings. And as, in degree,\r\nthis same pomp is observed toward their inferiors by all the grades of\r\ncommissioned officers, even down to a midshipman, the evil is\r\nproportionately multiplied.\r\n\r\nIt would not at all diminish a proper respect for the officers, and\r\nsubordination to their authority among the seamen, were all this idle\r\nparade—only ministering to the arrogance of the officers, without at\r\nall benefiting the state—completely done away. But to do so, we voters\r\nand lawgivers ourselves must be no respecters of persons.\r\n\r\nThat saying about _levelling upward, and not downward_, may seem very\r\nfine to those who cannot see its self-involved absurdity. But the truth\r\nis, that, to gain the true level, in some things, we _must_ cut\r\ndownward; for how can you make every sailor a commodore? or how raise\r\nthe valleys, without filling them up with the superfluous tops of the\r\nhills?\r\n\r\nSome discreet, but democratic, legislation in this matter is much to be\r\ndesired. And by bringing down naval officers, in these things at least,\r\nwithout affecting their legitimate dignity and authority, we shall\r\ncorrespondingly elevate the common sailor, without relaxing the\r\nsubordination, in which he should by all means be retained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\nA MAN-OF-WAR LIBRARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere does time pass more heavily than with most men-of-war’s-men on\r\nboard their craft in harbour.\r\n\r\nOne of my principal antidotes against _ennui_ in Rio, was reading.\r\nThere was a public library on board, paid for by government, and\r\nintrusted to the custody of one of the marine corporals, a little,\r\ndried-up man, of a somewhat literary turn. He had once been a clerk in\r\na post-office ashore; and, having been long accustomed to hand over\r\nletters when called for, he was now just the man to hand over books. He\r\nkept them in a large cask on the berth-deck, and, when seeking a\r\nparticular volume, had to capsize it like a barrel of potatoes. This\r\nmade him very cross and irritable, as most all librarians are. Who had\r\nthe selection of these books, I do not know, but some of them must have\r\nbeen selected by our Chaplain, who so pranced on Coleridge’s “_High\r\nGerman horse_.”\r\n\r\nMason Good’s Book of Nature—a very good book, to be sure, but not\r\nprecisely adapted to tarry tastes—was one of these volumes; and\r\nMachiavel’s Art of War—which was very dry fighting; and a folio of\r\nTillotson’s Sermons—the best of reading for divines, indeed, but with\r\nlittle relish for a main-top-man; and Locke’s Essays—incomparable\r\nessays, everybody knows, but miserable reading at sea; and Plutarch’s\r\nLives—super-excellent biographies, which pit Greek against Roman in\r\nbeautiful style, but then, in a sailor’s estimation, not to be\r\nmentioned with the _Lives of the Admirals_; and Blair’s Lectures,\r\nUniversity Edition—a fine treatise on rhetoric, but having nothing to\r\nsay about nautical phrases, such as “_splicing the main-brace_,”\r\n“_passing a gammoning_,” “_puddinging the dolphin_,” and “_making a\r\nCarrick-bend_;” besides numerous invaluable but unreadable tomes, that\r\nmight have been purchased cheap at the auction of some\r\ncollege-professor’s library.\r\n\r\nBut I found ample entertainment in a few choice old authors, whom I\r\nstumbled upon in various parts of the ship, among the inferior\r\nofficers. One was “_Morgan’s History of Algiers_,” a famous old quarto,\r\nabounding in picturesque narratives of corsairs, captives, dungeons,\r\nand sea-fights; and making mention of a cruel old Dey, who, toward the\r\nlatter part of his life, was so filled with remorse for his cruelties\r\nand crimes that he could not stay in bed after four o’clock in the\r\nmorning, but had to rise in great trepidation and walk off his bad\r\nfeelings till breakfast time. And another venerable octavo, containing\r\na certificate from Sir Christopher Wren to its authenticity, entitled\r\n“_Knox’s Captivity in Ceylon, 1681_”—abounding in stories about the\r\nDevil, who was superstitiously supposed to tyrannise over that\r\nunfortunate land: to mollify him, the priests offered up buttermilk,\r\nred cocks, and sausages; and the Devil ran roaring about in the woods,\r\nfrightening travellers out of their wits; insomuch that the Islanders\r\nbitterly lamented to Knox that their country was full of devils, and\r\nconsequently, there was no hope for their eventual well-being. Knox\r\nswears that he himself heard the Devil roar, though he did not see his\r\nhorns; it was a terrible noise, he says, like the baying of a hungry\r\nmastiff.\r\n\r\nThen there was Walpole’s Letters—very witty, pert, and polite—and some\r\nodd volumes of plays, each of which was a precious casket of jewels of\r\ngood things, shaming the trash nowadays passed off for dramas,\r\ncontaining “The Jew of Malta,” “Old Fortunatus,” “The City Madam.”\r\n“Volpone,” “The Alchymist,” and other glorious old dramas of the age of\r\nMarlow and Jonson, and that literary Damon and Pythias, the\r\nmagnificent, mellow old Beaumont and Fletcher, who have sent the long\r\nshadow of their reputation, side by side with Shakspeare’s, far down\r\nthe endless vale of posterity. And may that shadow never be less! but\r\nas for St. Shakspeare may his never be more, lest the commentators\r\narise, and settling upon his sacred text like unto locusts, devour it\r\nclean up, leaving never a dot over an I.\r\n\r\nI diversified this reading of mine, by borrowing Moore’s “_Loves of the\r\nAngels_” from Rose-water, who recommended it as “_de charmingest of\r\nvolumes;_” and a Negro Song-book, containing _Sittin’ on a Rail_,\r\n_Gumbo Squash_, and _Jim along Josey_, from Broadbit, a\r\nsheet-anchor-man. The sad taste of this old tar, in admiring such\r\nvulgar stuff, was much denounced by Rose-water, whose own predilections\r\nwere of a more elegant nature, as evinced by his exalted opinion of the\r\nliterary merits of the “_Loves of the Angels_.”\r\n\r\nI was by no means the only reader of books on board the Neversink.\r\nSeveral other sailors were diligent readers, though their studies did\r\nnot lie in the way of belles-lettres. Their favourite authors were such\r\nas you may find at the book-stalls around Fulton Market; they were\r\nslightly physiological in their nature. My book experiences on board of\r\nthe frigate proved an example of a fact which every book-lover must\r\nhave experienced before me, namely, that though public libraries have\r\nan imposing air, and doubtless contain invaluable volumes, yet,\r\nsomehow, the books that prove most agreeable, grateful, and\r\ncompanionable, are those we pick up by chance here and there; those\r\nwhich seem put into our hands by Providence; those which pretend to\r\nlittle, but abound in much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\nKILLING TIME IN A MAN-OF-WAR IN HARBOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\nReading was by no means the only method adopted by my shipmates in\r\nwhiling away the long, tedious hours in harbour. In truth, many of them\r\ncould not have read, had they wanted to ever so much; in early youth\r\ntheir primers had been sadly neglected. Still, they had other pursuits;\r\nsome were experts at the needle, and employed their time in making\r\nelaborate shirts, stitching picturesque eagles, and anchors, and all\r\nthe stars of the federated states in the collars thereof; so that when\r\nthey at last completed and put on these shirts, they may be said to\r\nhave hoisted the American colors.\r\n\r\nOthers excelled in _tattooing_ or _pricking_, as it is called in a\r\nman-of-war. Of these prickers, two had long been celebrated, in their\r\nway, as consummate masters of the art. Each had a small box full of\r\ntools and colouring matter; and they charged so high for their\r\nservices, that at the end of the cruise they were supposed to have\r\ncleared upward of four hundred dollars. They would _prick_ you to order\r\na palm-tree, or an anchor, a crucifix, a lady, a lion, an eagle, or\r\nanything else you might want.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic sailors on board had at least the crucifix pricked\r\non their arms, and for this reason: If they chanced to die in a\r\nCatholic land, they would be sure of a decent burial in consecrated\r\nground, as the priest would be sure to observe the symbol of Mother\r\nChurch on their persons. They would not fare as Protestant sailors\r\ndying in Callao, who are shoved under the sands of St. Lorenzo, a\r\nsolitary, volcanic island in the harbour, overrun with reptiles, their\r\nheretical bodies not being permitted to repose in the more genial loam\r\nof Lima.\r\n\r\nAnd many sailors not Catholics were anxious to have the crucifix\r\npainted on them, owing to a curious superstition of theirs. They\r\naffirm—some of them—that if you have that mark tattooed upon all four\r\nlimbs, you might fall overboard among seven hundred and seventy-five\r\nthousand white sharks, all dinnerless, and not one of them would so\r\nmuch as dare to smell at your little finger.\r\n\r\nWe had one fore-top-man on board, who, during the entire cruise, was\r\nhaving an endless cable _pricked_ round and round his waist, so that,\r\nwhen his frock was off, he looked like a capstan with a hawser coiled\r\nround about it. This fore-top-man paid eighteen pence per link for the\r\ncable, besides being on the smart the whole cruise, suffering the\r\neffects of his repeated puncturings; so he paid very dear for his\r\ncable.\r\n\r\nOne other mode of passing time while in port was cleaning and polishing\r\nyour _bright-work_; for it must be known that, in men-of-war, every\r\nsailor has some brass or steel of one kind or other to keep in high\r\norder—like housemaids, whose business it is to keep well-polished the\r\nknobs on the front door railing and the parlour-grates.\r\n\r\nExcepting the ring-bolts, eye-bolts, and belaying-pins scattered about\r\nthe decks, this bright-work, as it is called, is principally about the\r\nguns, embracing the “_monkey-tails_” of the carronades, the screws,\r\n_prickers_, little irons, and other things.\r\n\r\nThe portion that fell to my own share I kept in superior order, quite\r\nequal in polish to Rogers’s best cutlery. I received the most\r\nextravagant encomiums from the officers; one of whom offered to match\r\nme against any brazier or brass-polisher in her British Majesty’s Navy.\r\nIndeed, I devoted myself to the work body and soul, and thought no\r\npains too painful, and no labour too laborious, to achieve the highest\r\nattainable polish possible for us poor lost sons of Adam to reach.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion, even, when woollen rags were scarce, and no\r\nburned-brick was to be had from the ship’s Yeoman, I sacrificed the\r\ncorners of my woollen shirt, and used some dentrifice I had, as\r\nsubstitutes for the rags and burned-brick. The dentrifice operated\r\ndelightfully, and made the threading of my carronade screw shine and\r\ngrin again, like a set of false teeth in an eager heiress-hunter’s\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nStill another mode of passing time, was arraying yourself in your best\r\n“_togs_” and promenading up and down the gun-deck, admiring the shore\r\nscenery from the port-holes, which, in an amphitheatrical bay like\r\nRio—belted about by the most varied and charming scenery of hill, dale,\r\nmoss, meadow, court, castle, tower, grove, vine, vineyard, aqueduct,\r\npalace, square, island, fort—is very much like lounging round a\r\ncircular cosmorama, and ever and anon lazily peeping through the\r\nglasses here and there. Oh! there is something worth living for, even\r\nin our man-of-war world; and one glimpse of a bower of grapes, though a\r\ncable’s length off, is almost satisfaction for dining off a shank-bone\r\nsalted down.\r\n\r\nThis promenading was chiefly patronised by the marines, and\r\nparticularly by Colbrook, a remarkably handsome and very gentlemanly\r\ncorporal among them. He was a complete lady’s man; with fine black\r\neyes, bright red cheeks, glossy jet whiskers, and a refined\r\norganisation of the whole man. He used to array himself in his\r\nregimentals, and saunter about like an officer of the Coldstream\r\nGuards, strolling down to his club in St. James’s. Every time he passed\r\nme, he would heave a sentimental sigh, and hum to himself “_The girl I\r\nleft behind me_.” This fine corporal afterward became a representative\r\nin the Legislature of the State of New Jersey; for I saw his name\r\nreturned about a year after my return home.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, there was not much room, while in port, for\r\npromenading, at least on the gun-deck, for the whole larboard side is\r\nkept clear for the benefit of the officers, who appreciate the\r\nadvantages of having a clear stroll fore and aft; and they well know\r\nthat the sailors had much better be crowded together on the other side\r\nthan that the set of their own coat-tails should be impaired by\r\nbrushing against their tarry trowsers.\r\n\r\nOne other way of killing time while in port is playing checkers; that\r\nis, when it is permitted; for it is not every navy captain who will\r\nallow such a scandalous proceeding, But, as for Captain Claret, though\r\nhe _did_ like his glass of Madeira uncommonly well, and was an\r\nundoubted descendant from the hero of the Battle of the Brandywine, and\r\nthough he sometimes showed a suspiciously flushed face when\r\nsuperintending in person the flogging of a sailor for getting\r\nintoxicated against his particular orders, yet I will say for Captain\r\nClaret that, upon the whole, he was rather indulgent to his crew, so\r\nlong as they were perfectly docile. He allowed them to play checkers as\r\nmuch as they pleased. More than once I have known him, when going\r\nforward to the forecastle, pick his way carefully among scores of\r\ncanvas checker-cloths spread upon the deck, so as not to tread upon the\r\nmen—the checker-men and man-of-war’s-men included; but, in a certain\r\nsense, they were both one; for, as the sailors used their checker-men,\r\nso, at quarters, their officers used these man-of-war’s men.\r\n\r\nBut Captain Claret’s leniency in permitting checkers on board his ship\r\nmight have arisen from the following little circumstance,\r\nconfidentially communicated to me. Soon after the ship had sailed from\r\nhome, checkers were prohibited; whereupon the sailors were exasperated\r\nagainst the Captain, and one night, when he was walking round the\r\nforecastle, bim! came an iron belaying-pin past his ears; and while he\r\nwas dodging that, bim! came another, from the other side; so that, it\r\nbeing a very dark night, and nobody to be seen, and it being impossible\r\nto find out the trespassers, he thought it best to get back into his\r\ncabin as soon as possible. Some time after—just as if the belaying-pins\r\nhad nothing to do with it—it was indirectly rumoured that the\r\nchecker-boards might be brought out again, which—as a philosophical\r\nshipmate observed—showed that Captain Claret was a man of a ready\r\nunderstanding, and could understand a hint as well as any other man,\r\neven when conveyed by several pounds of iron.\r\n\r\nSome of the sailors were very precise about their checker-cloths, and\r\neven went so far that they would not let you play with them unless you\r\nfirst washed your hands, especially if so be you had just come from\r\ntarring down the rigging.\r\n\r\nAnother way of beguiling the tedious hours, is to get a cosy seat\r\nsomewhere, and fall into as snug a little reverie as you can. Or if a\r\nseat is not to be had—which is frequently the case—then get a tolerably\r\ncomfortable _stand-up_ against the bulwarks, and begin to think about\r\nhome and bread and butter—always inseparably connected to a\r\nwanderer—which will very soon bring delicious tears into your eyes; for\r\nevery one knows what a luxury is grief, when you can get a private\r\ncloset to enjoy it in, and no Paul Prys intrude. Several of my shore\r\nfriends, indeed, when suddenly overwhelmed by some disaster, always\r\nmake a point of flying to the first oyster-cellar, and shutting\r\nthemselves up in a box with nothing but a plate of stewed oysters, some\r\ncrackers, the castor, and a decanter of old port.\r\n\r\nStill another way of killing time in harbour, is to lean over the\r\nbulwarks, and speculate upon where, under the sun, you are going to be\r\nthat day next year, which is a subject full of interest to every living\r\nsoul; so much so, that there is a particular day of a particular month\r\nof the year, which, from my earliest recollections, I have always kept\r\nthe run of, so that I can even now tell just where I was on that\r\nidentical day of every year past since I was twelve years old. And,\r\nwhen I am all alone, to run over this almanac in my mind is almost as\r\nentertaining as to read your own diary, and far more interesting than\r\nto peruse a table of logarithms on a rainy afternoon. I always keep the\r\nanniversary of that day with lamb and peas, and a pint of sherry, for\r\nit comes in Spring. But when it came round in the Neversink, I could\r\nget neither lamb, peas, nor sherry.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the best way to drive the hours before you four-in-hand, is\r\nto select a soft plank on the gun-deck, and go to sleep. A fine\r\nspecific, which seldom fails, unless, to be sure, you have been\r\nsleeping all the twenty-four hours beforehand.\r\n\r\nWhenever employed in killing time in harbour, I have lifted myself up\r\non my elbow and looked around me, and seen so many of my shipmates all\r\nemployed at the same common business; all under lock and key; all\r\nhopeless prisoners like myself; all under martial law; all dieting on\r\nsalt beef and biscuit; all in one uniform; all yawning, gaping, and\r\nstretching in concert, it was then that I used to feel a certain love\r\nand affection for them, grounded, doubtless, on a fellow-feeling.\r\n\r\nAnd though, in a previous part of this narrative, I have mentioned that\r\nI used to hold myself somewhat aloof from the mass of seamen on board\r\nthe Neversink; and though this was true, and my real acquaintances were\r\ncomparatively few, and my intimates still fewer, yet, to tell the\r\ntruth, it is quite impossible to live so long with five hundred of your\r\nfellow-beings, even if not of the best families in the land, and with\r\nmorals that would not be spoiled by further cultivation; it is quite\r\nimpossible, I say, to live with five hundred of your fellow-beings, be\r\nthey who they may, without feeling a common sympathy with them at the\r\ntime, and ever after cherishing some sort of interest in their welfare.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this was curiously corroborated by a rather equivocal\r\nacquaintance of mine, who, among the men, went by the name of\r\n“_Shakings_.” He belonged to the fore-hold, whence, of a dark night, he\r\nwould sometimes emerge to chat with the sailors on deck. I never liked\r\nthe man’s looks; I protest it was a mere accident that gave me the\r\nhonour of his acquaintance, and generally I did my best to avoid him,\r\nwhen he would come skulking, like a jail-bird, out of his den into the\r\nliberal, open air of the sky. Nevertheless, the anecdote this _holder_\r\ntold me is well worth preserving, more especially the extraordinary\r\nfrankness evinced in his narrating such a thing to a comparative\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nThe substance of his story was as follows: Shakings, it seems, had once\r\nbeen a convict in the New York State’s Prison at Sing Sing, where he\r\nhad been for years confined for a crime, which he gave me his solemn\r\nword of honour he was wholly innocent of. He told me that, after his\r\nterm had expired, and he went out into the world again, he never could\r\nstumble upon any of his old Sing Sing associates without dropping into\r\na public house and talking over old times. And when fortune would go\r\nhard with him, and he felt out of sorts, and incensed at matters and\r\nthings in general, he told me that, at such time, he almost wished he\r\nwas back again in Sing Sing, where he was relieved from all anxieties\r\nabout what he should eat and drink, and was supported, like the\r\nPresident of the United States and Prince Albert, at the public charge.\r\nHe used to have such a snug little cell, he said, all to himself, and\r\nnever felt afraid of house-breakers, for the walls were uncommonly\r\nthick, and his door was securely bolted for him, and a watchman was all\r\nthe time walking up and down in the passage, while he himself was fast\r\nasleep and dreaming. To this, in substance, the _holder_ added, that he\r\nnarrated this anecdote because he thought it applicable to a\r\nman-of-war, which he scandalously asserted to be a sort of State Prison\r\nafloat.\r\n\r\nConcerning the curious disposition to fraternise and be sociable, which\r\nthis Shakings mentioned as characteristic of the convicts liberated\r\nfrom his old homestead at Sing Sing, it may well be asked, whether it\r\nmay not prove to be some feeling, somehow akin to the reminiscent\r\nimpulses which influenced them, that shall hereafter fraternally\r\nreunite all us mortals, when we shall have exchanged this State’s\r\nPrison man-of-war world of ours for another and a better.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing account of the great difficulty we had in killing\r\ntime while in port, it must not be inferred that on board of the\r\nNeversink in Rio there was literally no work to be done, at long\r\nintervals the _launch_ would come alongside with water-casks, to be\r\nemptied into iron tanks in the hold. In this way nearly fifty thousand\r\ngallons, as chronicled in the books of the master’s mate, were decanted\r\ninto the ship’s bowels—a ninety day’s allowance. With this huge Lake\r\nOntario in us, the mighty Neversink might be said to resemble the\r\nunited continent of the Eastern Hemisphere—floating in a vast ocean\r\nherself, and having a Mediterranean floating in her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\nSMUGGLING IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is in a good degree owing to the idleness just described, that,\r\nwhile lying in harbour, the man-of-war’s-man is exposed to the most\r\ntemptations and gets into his saddest scrapes. For though his vessel be\r\nanchored a mile from the shore, and her sides are patrolled by sentries\r\nnight and day, yet these things cannot entirely prevent the seductions\r\nof the land from reaching him. The prime agent in working his\r\ncalamities in port is his old arch-enemy, the ever-devilish god of\r\ngrog.\r\n\r\nImmured as the man-of-war’s-man is, serving out his weary three years\r\nin a sort of sea-Newgate, from which he cannot escape, either by the\r\nroof or burrowing underground, he too often flies to the bottle to seek\r\nrelief from the intolerable ennui of nothing to do, and nowhere to go.\r\nHis ordinary government allowance of spirits, one gill per diem, is not\r\nenough to give a sufficient to his listless senses; he pronounces his\r\ngrog basely _watered_; he scouts at it as _thinner than muslin;_ he\r\ncraves a more vigorous _nip at the cable_, a more sturdy _swig at the\r\nhalyards;_ and if opium were to be had, many would steep themselves a\r\nthousand fathoms down in the densest fumes of that oblivious drug. Tell\r\nhim that the delirium tremens and the mania-a-potu lie in ambush for\r\ndrunkards, he will say to you, “Let them bear down upon me, then,\r\nbefore the wind; anything that smacks of life is better than to feel\r\nDavy Jones’s chest-lid on your nose.” He is reckless as an avalanche;\r\nand though his fall destroy himself and others, yet a ruinous commotion\r\nis better than being frozen fast in unendurable solitudes. No wonder,\r\nthen, that he goes all lengths to procure the thing he craves; no\r\nwonder that he pays the most exorbitant prices, breaks through all law,\r\nand braves the ignominious lash itself, rather than be deprived of his\r\nstimulus.\r\n\r\nNow, concerning no one thing in a man-of-war, are the regulations more\r\nsevere than respecting the smuggling of grog, and being found\r\nintoxicated. For either offence there is but one penalty, invariably\r\nenforced; and that is the degradation of the gangway.\r\n\r\nAll conceivable precautions are taken by most frigate-executives to\r\nguard against the secret admission of spirits into the vessel. In the\r\nfirst place, no shore-boat whatever is allowed to approach a man-of-war\r\nin a foreign harbour without permission from the officer of the deck.\r\nEven the _bum-boats_, the small craft licensed by the officers to bring\r\noff fruit for the sailors, to be bought out of their own money—these\r\nare invariably inspected before permitted to hold intercourse with the\r\nship’s company. And not only this, but every one of the numerous ship’s\r\nboats—kept almost continually plying to and from the shore—are\r\nsimilarly inspected, sometimes each boat twenty times in the day.\r\n\r\nThis inspection is thus performed: The boat being descried by the\r\nquarter-master from the poop, she is reported to the deck officer, who\r\nthereupon summons the master-at-arms, the ship’s chief of police. This\r\nfunctionary now stations himself at the gangway, and as the boat’s\r\ncrew, one by one, come up the side, he personally overhauls them,\r\nmaking them take off their hats, and then, placing both hands upon\r\ntheir heads, draws his palms slowly down to their feet, carefully\r\nfeeling all unusual protuberances. If nothing suspicious is felt, the\r\nman is let pass; and so on, till the whole boat’s crew, averaging about\r\nsixteen men, are examined. The chief of police then descends into the\r\nboat, and walks from stem to stern, eyeing it all over, and poking his\r\nlong rattan into every nook and cranny. This operation concluded, and\r\nnothing found, he mounts the ladder, touches his hat to the\r\ndeck-officer, and reports the boat _clean_; whereupon she is hauled out\r\nto the booms.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that not a man of the ship’s company ever enters\r\nthe vessel from shore without it being rendered next to impossible,\r\napparently, that he should have succeeded in smuggling anything. Those\r\nindividuals who are permitted to board the ship without undergoing this\r\nordeal, are only persons whom it would be preposterous to search—such\r\nas the Commodore himself, the Captain, Lieutenants, etc., and gentlemen\r\nand ladies coming as visitors.\r\n\r\nFor anything to be clandestinely thrust through the lower port-holes at\r\nnight, is rendered very difficult, from the watchfulness of the\r\nquarter-master in hailing all boats that approach, long before they\r\ndraw alongside, and the vigilance of the sentries, posted on platforms\r\noverhanging the water, whose orders are to fire into a strange boat\r\nwhich, after being warned to withdraw, should still persist in drawing\r\nnigh. Moreover, thirty-two-pound shots are slung to ropes, and\r\nsuspended over the bows, to drop a hole into and sink any small craft,\r\nwhich, spite of all precautions, by strategy should succeed in getting\r\nunder the bows with liquor by night. Indeed, the whole power of martial\r\nlaw is enlisted in this matter; and every one of the numerous officers\r\nof the ship, besides his general zeal in enforcing the regulations,\r\nadds to that a personal feeling, since the sobriety of the men abridges\r\nhis own cares and anxieties.\r\n\r\nHow then, it will be asked, in the face of an argus-eyed police, and in\r\ndefiance even of bayonets and bullets, do men-of-war’s-men contrive to\r\nsmuggle their spirits? Not to enlarge upon minor stratagems—every few\r\ndays detected, and rendered naught (such as rolling up, in a\r\nhandkerchief, a long, slender “skin” of grog, like a sausage, and in\r\nthat manner ascending to the deck out of a boat just from shore; or\r\nopenly bringing on board cocoa-nuts and melons, procured from a knavish\r\nbum-boat filled with spirits, instead of milk or water)—we will only\r\nmention here two or three other modes, coming under my own observation.\r\n\r\nWhile in Rio, a fore-top-man, belonging to the second cutter, paid down\r\nthe money, and made an arrangement with a person encountered at the\r\nPalace-landing ashore, to the following effect. Of a certain moonless\r\nnight, he was to bring off three gallons of spirits, _in skins_, and\r\nmoor them to the frigate’s anchor-buoy—some distance from the\r\nvessel—attaching something heavy, to sink them out of sight. In the\r\nmiddle watch of the night, the fore-top-man slips out of his hammock,\r\nand by creeping along in the shadows, eludes the vigilance of the\r\nmaster-at-arms and his mates, gains a port-hole, and softly lowers\r\nhimself into the water, almost without creating a ripple—the sentries\r\nmarching to and fro on their overhanging platform above him. He is an\r\nexpert swimmer, and paddles along under the surface, every now and then\r\nrising a little, and lying motionless on his back to breathe—little but\r\nhis nose exposed. The buoy gained, he cuts the skins adrift, ties them\r\nround his body, and in the same adroit manner makes good his return.\r\n\r\nThis feat is very seldom attempted, for it needs the utmost caution,\r\naddress, and dexterity; and no one but a super-expert burglar, and\r\nfaultless Leander of a swimmer, could achieve it.\r\n\r\nFrom the greater privileges which they enjoy, the “_forward officers_,”\r\nthat is, the Gunner, Boatswain, etc., have much greater opportunities\r\nfor successful smuggling than the common seamen. Coming alongside one\r\nnight in a cutter, Yarn, our boatswain, in some inexplicable way,\r\ncontrived to slip several skins of brandy through the air-port of his\r\nown state-room. The feat, however, must have been perceived by one of\r\nthe boat’s crew, who immediately, on gaining the deck, sprung down the\r\nladders, stole into the boatswain’s room, and made away with the prize,\r\nnot three minutes before the rightful owner entered to claim it.\r\nThough, from certain circumstances, the thief was known to the\r\naggrieved party, yet the latter could say nothing, since he himself had\r\ninfringed the law. But the next day, in the capacity of captain of the\r\nship’s executioners, Yarn had the satisfaction (it was so to him) of\r\nstanding over the robber at the gangway; for, being found intoxicated\r\nwith the very liquor the boatswain himself had smuggled, the man had\r\nbeen condemned to a flogging.\r\n\r\nThis recalls another instance, still more illustrative of the knotted,\r\ntrebly intertwisted villainy, accumulating at a sort of compound\r\ninterest in a man-of-war. The cockswain of the Commodore’s barge takes\r\nhis crew apart, one by one, and cautiously sounds them as to their\r\nfidelity—not to the United States of America, but to himself. Three\r\nindividuals, whom he deems doubtful—that is, faithful to the United\r\nStates of America—he procures to be discharged from the barge, and men\r\nof his own selection are substituted; for he is always an influential\r\ncharacter, this cockswain of the Commodore’s barge. Previous to this,\r\nhowever, he has seen to it well, that no Temperance men—that is,\r\nsailors who do not draw their government ration of grog, but take the\r\nmoney for it—he has seen to it, that none of these _balkers_ are\r\nnumbered among his crew. Having now proved his men, he divulges his\r\nplan to the assembled body; a solemn oath of secrecy is obtained, and\r\nhe waits the first fit opportunity to carry into execution his\r\nnefarious designs.\r\n\r\nAt last it comes. One afternoon the barge carries the Commodore across\r\nthe Bay to a fine water-side settlement of noblemen’s seats, called\r\nPraya Grande. The Commodore is visiting a Portuguese marquis, and the\r\npair linger long over their dinner in an arbour in the garden.\r\nMeanwhile, the cockswain has liberty to roam about where he pleases. He\r\nsearches out a place where some choice _red-eye_ (brandy) is to be had,\r\npurchases six large bottles, and conceals them among the trees. Under\r\nthe pretence of filling the boat-keg with water, which is always kept\r\nin the barge to refresh the crew, he now carries it off into the grove,\r\nknocks out the head, puts the bottles inside, reheads the keg, fills it\r\nwith water, carries it down to the boat, and audaciously restores it to\r\nits conspicuous position in the middle, with its bung-hole up. When the\r\nCommodore comes down to the beach, and they pull off for the ship, the\r\ncockswain, in a loud voice, commands the nearest man to take that bung\r\nout of the keg—that precious water will spoil. Arrived alongside the\r\nfrigate, the boat’s crew are overhauled, as usual, at the gangway; and\r\nnothing being found on them, are passed. The master-at-arms now\r\ndescending into the barge, and finding nothing suspicious, reports it\r\n_clean_, having put his finger into the open bung of the keg and tasted\r\nthat the water was pure. The barge is ordered out to the booms, and\r\ndeep night is waited for, ere the cockswain essays to snatch the\r\nbottles from the keg.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately for the success of this masterly smuggler, one of\r\nhis crew is a weak-pated fellow, who, having drank somewhat freely\r\nashore, goes about the gun-deck throwing out profound, tipsy hints\r\nconcerning some unutterable proceeding on the ship’s anvil. A knowing\r\nold sheet-anchor-man, an unprincipled fellow, putting this, that, and\r\nthe other together, ferrets out the mystery; and straightway resolves\r\nto reap the goodly harvest which the cockswain has sowed. He seeks him\r\nout, takes him to one side, and addresses him thus:\r\n\r\n“Cockswain, you have been smuggling off some _red-eye_, which at this\r\nmoment is in your barge at the booms. Now, cockswain, I have stationed\r\ntwo of my mess-mates at the port-holes, on that side of the ship; and\r\nif they report to me that you, or any of your bargemen, offer to enter\r\nthat barge before morning, I will immediately report you as a smuggler\r\nto the officer of the deck.”\r\n\r\nThe cockswain is astounded; for, to be reported to the deck-officer as\r\na smuggler, would inevitably procure him a sound flogging, and be the\r\ndisgraceful _breaking_ of him as a petty officer, receiving four\r\ndollars a month beyond his pay as an able seaman. He attempts to bribe\r\nthe other to secrecy, by promising half the profits of the enterprise;\r\nbut the sheet-anchor-man’s integrity is like a rock; he is no\r\nmercenary, to be bought up for a song. The cockswain, therefore, is\r\nforced to swear that neither himself, nor any of his crew, shall enter\r\nthe barge before morning. This done, the sheet-anchor-man goes to his\r\nconfidants, and arranges his plans. In a word, he succeeds in\r\nintroducing the six brandy bottles into the ship; five of which he\r\nsells at eight dollars a bottle; and then, with the sixth, between two\r\nguns, he secretly regales himself and confederates; while the helpless\r\ncockswain, stifling his rage, bitterly eyes them from afar.\r\n\r\nThus, though they say that there is honour among thieves, there is\r\nlittle among man-of-war smugglers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\nA KNAVE IN OFFICE IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last smuggling story now about to be related also occurred while we\r\nlay in Rio. It is the more particularly presented, since it furnishes\r\nthe most curious evidence of the almost incredible corruption pervading\r\nnearly all ranks in some men-of-war.\r\n\r\nFor some days, the number of intoxicated sailors collared and brought\r\nup to the mast by the master-at-arms, to be reported to the\r\ndeck-officers—previous to a flogging at the gangway—had, in the last\r\ndegree, excited the surprise and vexation of the Captain and senior\r\nofficers. So strict were the Captain’s regulations concerning the\r\nsuppression of grog-smuggling, and so particular had he been in\r\ncharging the matter upon all the Lieutenants, and every understrapper\r\nofficial in the frigate, that he was wholly at a loss how so large a\r\nquantity of spirits could have been spirited into the ship, in the face\r\nof all these checks, guards, and precautions.\r\n\r\nStill additional steps were adopted to detect the smugglers; and Bland,\r\nthe master-at-arms, together with his corporals, were publicly\r\nharangued at the mast by the Captain in person, and charged to exert\r\ntheir best powers in suppressing the traffic. Crowds were present at\r\nthe time, and saw the master-at-arms touch his cap in obsequious\r\nhomage, as he solemnly assured the Captain that he would still continue\r\nto do his best; as, indeed, he said he had always done. He concluded\r\nwith a pious ejaculation expressive of his personal abhorrence of\r\nsmuggling and drunkenness, and his fixed resolution, so help him\r\nHeaven, to spend his last wink in sitting up by night, to spy out all\r\ndeeds of darkness.\r\n\r\n“I do not doubt you, master-at-arms,” returned the Captain; “now go to\r\nyour duty.” This master-at-arms was a favourite of the Captain’s.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, before breakfast, when the market-boat came off (that\r\nis, one of the ship’s boats regularly deputed to bring off the daily\r\nfresh provisions for the officers)—when this boat came off, the\r\nmaster-at-arms, as usual, after carefully examining both her and her\r\ncrew, reported them to the deck-officer to be free from suspicion. The\r\nprovisions were then hoisted out, and among them came a good-sized\r\nwooden box, addressed to “Mr. —— Purser of the United States ship\r\nNeversink.” Of course, any private matter of this sort, destined for a\r\ngentleman of the ward-room, was sacred from examination, and the\r\nmaster-at-arms commanded one of his corporals to carry it down into the\r\nPurser’s state-room. But recent occurrences had sharpened the vigilance\r\nof the deck-officer to an unwonted degree, and seeing the box going\r\ndown the hatchway, he demanded what that was, and whom it was for.\r\n\r\n“All right, sir,” said the master-at-arms, touching his cap; “stores\r\nfor the Purser, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Let it remain on deck,” said the Lieutenant. “Mr. Montgomery!” calling\r\na midshipman, “ask the Purser whether there is any box coming off for\r\nhim this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, sir,” said the middy, touching his cap.\r\n\r\nPresently he returned, saying that the Purser was ashore.\r\n\r\n“Very good, then; Mr. Montgomery, have that box put into the ‘brig,’\r\nwith strict orders to the sentry not to suffer any one to touch it.”\r\n\r\n“Had I not better take it down into my mess, sir, till the Purser comes\r\noff?” said the master-at-arms, deferentially.\r\n\r\n“I have given my orders, sir!” said the Lieutenant, turning away.\r\n\r\nWhen the Purser came on board, it turned out that he knew nothing at\r\nall about the box. He had never so much as heard of it in his life. So\r\nit was again brought up before the deck-officer, who immediately\r\nsummoned the master-at-arms.\r\n\r\n“Break open that box!”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, sir!” said the master-at-arms; and, wrenching off the\r\ncover, twenty-five brown jugs like a litter of twenty-five brown pigs,\r\nwere found snugly nestled in a bed of straw.\r\n\r\n“The smugglers are at work, sir,” said the master-at-arms, looking up.\r\n\r\n“Uncork and taste it,” said the officer.\r\n\r\nThe master-at-arms did so; and, smacking his lips after a puzzled\r\nfashion, was a little doubtful whether it was American whisky or\r\nHolland gin; but he said he was not used to liquor.\r\n\r\n“Brandy; I know it by the smell,” said the officer; “return the box to\r\nthe brig.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, sir,” said the master-at-arms, redoubling his activity.\r\n\r\nThe affair was at once reported to the Captain, who, incensed at the\r\naudacity of the thing, adopted every plan to detect the guilty parties.\r\nInquiries were made ashore; but by whom the box had been brought down\r\nto the market-boat there was no finding out. Here the matter rested for\r\na time.\r\n\r\nSome days after, one of the boys of the mizzen-top was flogged for\r\ndrunkenness, and, while suspended in agony at the gratings, was made to\r\nreveal from whom he had procured his spirits. The man was called, and\r\nturned out to be an old superannuated marine, one Scriggs, who did the\r\ncooking for the marine-sergeants and masters-at-arms’ mess. This marine\r\nwas one of the most villainous-looking fellows in the ship, with a\r\nsquinting, pick-lock, gray eye, and hang-dog gallows gait. How such a\r\nmost unmartial vagabond had insinuated himself into the honourable\r\nmarine corps was a perfect mystery. He had always been noted for his\r\npersonal uncleanliness, and among all hands, fore and aft, had the\r\nreputation of being a notorious old miser, who denied himself the few\r\ncomforts, and many of the common necessaries of a man-of-war life.\r\n\r\nSeeing no escape, Scriggs fell on his knees before the Captain, and\r\nconfessed the charge of the boy. Observing the fellow to be in an agony\r\nof fear at the sight of the boatswain’s mates and their lashes, and all\r\nthe striking parade of public punishment, the Captain must have thought\r\nthis a good opportunity for completely pumping him of all his secrets.\r\nThis terrified marine was at length forced to reveal his having been\r\nfor some time an accomplice in a complicated system of underhand\r\nvillainy, the head of which was no less a personage than the\r\nindefatigable chief of police, the master-at-arms himself. It appeared\r\nthat this official had his confidential agents ashore, who supplied him\r\nwith spirits, and in various boxes, packages, and bundles—addressed to\r\nthe Purser and others—brought them down to the frigate’s boats at the\r\nlanding. Ordinarily, the appearance of these things for the Purser and\r\nother ward-room gentlemen occasioned no surprise; for almost every day\r\nsome bundle or other is coming off for them, especially for the Purser;\r\nand, as the master-at-arms was always present on these occasions, it\r\nwas an easy matter for him to hurry the smuggled liquor out of sight,\r\nand, under pretence of carrying the box or bundle down to the Purser’s\r\nroom, hide it away upon his own premises.\r\n\r\nThe miserly marine, Scriggs, with the pick-lock eye, was the man who\r\nclandestinely sold the spirits to the sailors, thus completely keeping\r\nthe master-at-arms in the background. The liquor sold at the most\r\nexorbitant prices; at one time reaching twelve dollars the bottle in\r\ncash, and thirty dollars a bottle in orders upon the Purser, to be\r\nhonored upon the frigate’s arrival home. It may seem incredible that\r\nsuch prices should have been given by the sailors; but when some\r\nman-of-war’s-men crave liquor, and it is hard to procure, they would\r\nalmost barter ten years of their life-time for but one solitary “_tot_”\r\nif they could.\r\n\r\nThe sailors who became intoxicated with the liquor thus smuggled on\r\nboard by the master-at-arms, were, in almost numberless instances,\r\nofficially seized by that functionary and scourged at the gangway. In a\r\nprevious place it has been shown how conspicuous a part the\r\nmaster-at-arms enacts at this scene.\r\n\r\nThe ample profits of this iniquitous business were divided, between all\r\nthe parties concerned in it; Scriggs, the marine, coming in for one\r\nthird. His cook’s mess-chest being brought on deck, four canvas bags of\r\nsilver were found in it, amounting to a sum something short of as many\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\nThe guilty parties were scourged, double-ironed, and for several weeks\r\nwere confined in the “brig” under a sentry; all but the master-at-arms,\r\nwho was merely cashiered and imprisoned for a time; with bracelets at\r\nhis wrists. Upon being liberated, he was turned adrift among the ship’s\r\ncompany; and by way of disgracing him still more, was thrust into the\r\n_waist_, the most inglorious division of the ship.\r\n\r\nUpon going to dinner one day, I found him soberly seated at my own\r\nmess; and at first I could not but feel some very serious scruples\r\nabout dining with him. Nevertheless, he was a man to study and digest;\r\nso, upon a little reflection; I was not displeased at his presence. It\r\namazed me, however, that he had wormed himself into the mess, since so\r\nmany of the other messes had declined the honour, until at last, I\r\nascertained that he had induced a mess-mate of ours, a distant relation\r\nof his, to prevail upon the cook to admit him.\r\n\r\nNow it would not have answered for hardly any other mess in the ship to\r\nhave received this man among them, for it would have torn a huge rent\r\nin their reputation; but our mess, A. No. 1—the Forty-two-pounder\r\nClub—was composed of so fine a set of fellows; so many captains of\r\ntops, and quarter-masters—men of undeniable mark on board ship—of\r\nlong-established standing and consideration on the gun-deck; that, with\r\nimpunity, we could do so many equivocal things, utterly inadmissible\r\nfor messes of inferior pretension. Besides, though we all abhorred the\r\nmonster of Sin itself, yet, from our social superiority, highly\r\nrarified education in our lofty top, and large and liberal sweep of the\r\naggregate of things, we were in a good degree free from those useless,\r\npersonal prejudices, and galling hatreds against conspicuous _sinners_,\r\nnot _Sin_—which so widely prevail among men of warped understandings\r\nand unchristian and uncharitable hearts. No; the superstitions and\r\ndogmas concerning Sin had not laid their withering maxims upon our\r\nhearts. We perceived how that evil was but good disguised, and a knave\r\na saint in his way; how that in other planets, perhaps, what we deem\r\nwrong, may there be deemed right; even as some substances, without\r\nundergoing any mutations in themselves utterly change their colour,\r\naccording to the light thrown upon them. We perceived that the\r\nanticipated millennium must have begun upon the morning the first words\r\nwere created; and that, taken all in all, our man-of-war world itself\r\nwas as eligible a round-sterned craft as any to be found in the Milky\r\nWay. And we fancied that though some of us, of the gun-deck, were at\r\ntimes condemned to sufferings and blights, and all manner of\r\ntribulation and anguish, yet, no doubt, it was only our misapprehension\r\nof these things that made us take them for woeful pains instead of the\r\nmost agreeable pleasures. I have dreamed of a sphere, says Pinzella,\r\nwhere to break a man on the wheel is held the most exquisite of\r\ndelights you can confer upon him; where for one gentleman in any way to\r\nvanquish another is accounted an everlasting dishonour; where to tumble\r\none into a pit after death, and then throw cold clods upon his upturned\r\nface, is a species of contumely, only inflicted upon the most notorious\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\nBut whatever we mess-mates thought, in whatever circumstances we found\r\nourselves, we never forgot that our frigate, had as it was, was\r\nhomeward-bound. Such, at least, were our reveries at times, though\r\nsorely jarred, now and then, by events that took our philosophy aback.\r\nFor after all, philosophy—that is, the best wisdom that has ever in any\r\nway been revealed to our man-of-war world—is but a slough and a mire,\r\nwith a few tufts of good footing here and there.\r\n\r\nBut there was one man in the mess who would have naught to do with our\r\nphilosophy—a churlish, ill-tempered, unphilosophical, superstitious old\r\nbear of a quarter-gunner; a believer in Tophet, for which he was\r\naccordingly preparing himself. Priming was his name; but methinks I\r\nhave spoken of him before.\r\n\r\nBesides, this Bland, the master-at-arms, was no vulgar, dirty knave. In\r\nhim—to modify Burke’s phrase—vice _seemed_, but only seemed, to lose\r\nhalf its seeming evil by losing all its apparent grossness. He was a\r\nneat and gentlemanly villain, and broke his biscuit with a dainty hand.\r\nThere was a fine polish about his whole person, and a pliant,\r\ninsinuating style in his conversation, that was, socially, quite\r\nirresistible. Save my noble captain, Jack Chase, he proved himself the\r\nmost entertaining, I had almost said the most companionable man in the\r\nmess. Nothing but his mouth, that was somewhat small, Moorish-arched,\r\nand wickedly delicate, and his snaky, black eye, that at times shone\r\nlike a dark-lantern in a jeweller-shop at midnight, betokened the\r\naccomplished scoundrel within. But in his conversation there was no\r\ntrace of evil; nothing equivocal; he studiously shunned an indelicacy,\r\nnever swore, and chiefly abounded in passing puns and witticisms,\r\nvaried with humorous contrasts between ship and shore life, and many\r\nagreeable and racy anecdotes, very tastefully narrated. In short—in a\r\nmerely psychological point of view, at least—he was a charming\r\nblackleg. Ashore, such a man might have been an irreproachable\r\nmercantile swindler, circulating in polite society.\r\n\r\nBut he was still more than this. Indeed, I claim for this\r\nmaster-at-arms a lofty and honourable niche in the Newgate Calendar of\r\nhistory. His intrepidity, coolness, and wonderful self-possession in\r\ncalmly resigning himself to a fate that thrust him from an office in\r\nwhich he had tyrannised over five hundred mortals, many of whom hated\r\nand loathed him, passed all belief; his intrepidity, I say, in now\r\nfearlessly gliding among them, like a disarmed swordfish among\r\nferocious white-sharks; this, surely, bespoke no ordinary man. While in\r\noffice, even, his life had often been secretly attempted by the seamen\r\nwhom he had brought to the gangway. Of dark nights they had dropped\r\nshot down the hatchways, destined “to damage his pepper-box,” as they\r\nphrased it; they had made ropes with a hangman’s noose at the end and\r\ntried to _lasso_ him in dark corners. And now he was adrift among them,\r\nunder notorious circumstances of superlative villainy, at last dragged\r\nto light; and yet he blandly smiled, politely offered his cigar-holder\r\nto a perfect stranger, and laughed and chatted to right and left, as if\r\nspringy, buoyant, and elastic, with an angelic conscience, and sure of\r\nkind friends wherever he went, both in this life and the life to come.\r\n\r\nWhile he was lying ironed in the “brig,” gangs of the men were\r\nsometimes overheard whispering about the terrible reception they would\r\ngive him when he should be set at large. Nevertheless, when liberated,\r\nthey seemed confounded by his erect and cordial assurance, his\r\ngentlemanly sociability and fearless companionableness. From being an\r\nimplacable policeman, vigilant, cruel, and remorseless in his office,\r\nhowever polished in his phrases, he was now become a disinterested,\r\nsauntering man of leisure, winking at all improprieties, and ready to\r\nlaugh and make merry with any one. Still, at first, the men gave him a\r\nwide berth, and returned scowls for his smiles; but who can forever\r\nresist the very Devil himself, when he comes in the guise of a\r\ngentleman, free, fine, and frank? Though Goethe’s pious Margaret hates\r\nthe Devil in his horns and harpooner’s tail, yet she smiles and nods to\r\nthe engaging fiend in the persuasive, _winning_, oily, wholly harmless\r\nMephistopheles. But, however it was, I, for one, regarded this\r\nmaster-at-arms with mixed feelings of detestation, pity, admiration,\r\nand something opposed to enmity. I could not but abominate him when I\r\nthought of his conduct; but I pitied the continual gnawing which, under\r\nall his deftly-donned disguises, I saw lying at the bottom of his soul.\r\nI admired his heroism in sustaining himself so well under such\r\nreverses. And when I thought how arbitrary the _Articles of War_ are in\r\ndefining a man-of-war villain; how much undetected guilt might be\r\nsheltered by the aristocratic awning of our quarter-deck; how many\r\nflorid pursers, ornaments of the ward-room, had been legally protected\r\nin defrauding _the people_, I could not but say to myself, Well, after\r\nall, though this man is a most wicked one indeed, yet is he even more\r\nluckless than depraved.\r\n\r\nBesides, a studied observation of Bland convinced me that he was an\r\norganic and irreclaimable scoundrel, who did wicked deeds as the cattle\r\nbrowse the herbage, because wicked deeds seemed the legitimate\r\noperation of his whole infernal organisation. Phrenologically, he was\r\nwithout a soul. Is it to be wondered at, that the devils are\r\nirreligious? What, then, thought I, who is to blame in this matter? For\r\none, I will not take the Day of Judgment upon me by authoritatively\r\npronouncing upon the essential criminality of any man-of-war’s-man; and\r\nChristianity has taught me that, at the last day, man-of-war’s-men will\r\nnot be judged by the _Articles of War_, nor by the _United States\r\nStatutes at Large_, but by immutable laws, ineffably beyond the\r\ncomprehension of the honourable Board of Commodores and Navy\r\nCommissioners. But though I will stand by even a man-of-war thief, and\r\ndefend him from being seized up at the gangway, if I can—remembering\r\nthat my Saviour once hung between two thieves, promising one\r\nlife-eternal—yet I would not, after the plain conviction of a villain,\r\nagain let him entirely loose to prey upon honest seamen, fore and aft\r\nall three decks. But this did Captain Claret; and though the thing may\r\nnot perhaps be credited, nevertheless, here it shall be recorded.\r\n\r\nAfter the master-at-arms had been adrift among the ship’s company for\r\nseveral weeks, and we were within a few days’ sail of home, he was\r\nsummoned to the mast, and publicly reinstated in his office as the\r\nship’s chief of police. Perhaps Captain Claret had read the Memoirs of\r\nVidocq, and believed in the old saying, _set a rogue to catch a rogue_.\r\nOr, perhaps, he was a man of very tender feelings, highly susceptible\r\nto the soft emotions of gratitude, and could not bear to leave in\r\ndisgrace a person who, out of the generosity of his heart, had, about a\r\nyear previous, presented him with a rare snuff-box, fabricated from a\r\nsperm-whale’s tooth, with a curious silver hinge, and cunningly wrought\r\nin the shape of a whale; also a splendid gold-mounted cane, of a costly\r\nBrazilian wood, with a gold plate, bearing the Captain’s name and rank\r\nin the service, the place and time of his birth, and with a vacancy\r\nunderneath—no doubt providentially left for his heirs to record his\r\ndecease.\r\n\r\nCertain it was that, some months previous to the master-at-arms’\r\ndisgrace, he had presented these articles to the Captain, with his best\r\nlove and compliments; and the Captain had received them, and seldom\r\nwent ashore without the cane, and never took snuff but out of that box.\r\nWith some Captains, a sense of propriety might have induced them to\r\nreturn these presents, when the generous donor had proved himself\r\nunworthy of having them retained; but it was not Captain Claret who\r\nwould inflict such a cutting wound upon any officer’s sensibilities,\r\nthough long-established naval customs had habituated him to scourging\r\n_the people_ upon an emergency.\r\n\r\nNow had Captain Claret deemed himself constitutionally bound to decline\r\nall presents from his subordinates, the sense of gratitude would not\r\nhave operated to the prejudice of justice. And, as some of the\r\nsubordinates of a man-of-war captain are apt to invoke his good wishes\r\nand mollify his conscience by making him friendly gifts, it would\r\nperhaps _have_ been an excellent thing for him to adopt the plan\r\npursued by the President of the United States, when he received a\r\npresent of lions and Arabian chargers from the Sultan of Muscat. Being\r\nforbidden by his sovereign lords and masters, the imperial people, to\r\naccept of any gifts from foreign powers, the President sent them to an\r\nauctioneer, and the proceeds were deposited in the Treasury. In the\r\nsame manner, when Captain Claret received his snuff-box and cane, he\r\nmight have accepted them very kindly, and then sold them off to the\r\nhighest bidder, perhaps to the donor himself, who in that case would\r\nnever have tempted him again.\r\n\r\nUpon his return home, Bland was paid off for his full term, not\r\ndeducting the period of his suspension. He again entered the service in\r\nhis old capacity.\r\n\r\nAs no further allusion will be made to this affair, it may as well be\r\nstated now that, for the very brief period elapsing between his\r\nrestoration and being paid off in port by the Purser, the\r\nmaster-at-arms conducted himself with infinite discretion, artfully\r\nsteering between any relaxation of discipline—which would have awakened\r\nthe displeasure of the officers—and any unwise severity—which would\r\nhave revived, in tenfold force, all the old grudges of the seamen under\r\nhis command.\r\n\r\nNever did he show so much talent and tact as when vibrating in this his\r\nmost delicate predicament; and plenty of cause was there for the\r\nexercise of his cunningest abilities; for, upon the discharge of our\r\nman-of-war’s-men at home, should he _then_ be held by them as an enemy,\r\nas free and independent citizens they would waylay him in the public\r\nstreets, and take purple vengeance for all his iniquities, past,\r\npresent, and possible in the future. More than once a master-at-arms\r\nashore has been seized by night by an exasperated crew, and served as\r\nOrigen served himself, or as his enemies served Abelard.\r\n\r\nBut though, under extreme provocation, _the people_ of a man-of-war\r\nhave been guilty of the maddest vengeance, yet, at other times, they\r\nare very placable and milky-hearted, even to those who may have\r\noutrageously abused them; many things in point might be related, but I\r\nforbear.\r\n\r\nThis account of the master-at-arms cannot better be concluded than by\r\ndenominating him, in the vivid language of the Captain of the Fore-top,\r\nas “_the two ends and middle of the thrice-laid strand of a bloody\r\nrascal_,” which was intended for a terse, well-knit, and\r\nall-comprehensive assertion, without omission or reservation. It was\r\nalso asserted that, had Tophet itself been raked with a fine-tooth\r\ncomb, such another ineffable villain could not by any possibility have\r\nbeen caught.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\nPUBLISHING POETRY IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nA day or two after our arrival in Rio, a rather amusing incident\r\noccurred to a particular acquaintance of mine, young Lemsford, the\r\ngun-deck bard.\r\n\r\nThe great guns of an armed ship have blocks of wood, called _tompions_,\r\npainted black, inserted in their muzzles, to keep out the spray of the\r\nsea. These tompions slip in and out very handily, like covers to butter\r\nfirkins.\r\n\r\nBy advice of a friend, Lemsford, alarmed for the fate of his box of\r\npoetry, had latterly made use of a particular gun on the main-deck, in\r\nthe tube of which he thrust his manuscripts, by simply crawling partly\r\nout of the porthole, removing the tompion, inserting his papers,\r\ntightly rolled, and making all snug again.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, he and I were reclining in the main-top—where, by\r\npermission of my noble master, Jack Chase, I had invited him—when, of a\r\nsudden, we heard a cannonading. It was our own ship.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said a top-man, “returning the shore salute they gave us\r\nyesterday.”\r\n\r\n“O Lord!” cried Lemsford, “my _Songs of the Sirens!_” and he ran down\r\nthe rigging to the batteries; but just as he touched the gun-deck, gun\r\nNo. 20—his literary strong-box—went off with a terrific report.\r\n\r\n“Well, my after-guard Virgil,” said Jack Chase to him, as he slowly\r\nreturned up the rigging, “did you get it? You need not answer; I see\r\nyou were too late. But never mind, my boy: no printer could do the\r\nbusiness for you better. That’s the way to publish, White-Jacket,”\r\nturning to me—“fire it right into ’em; every canto a twenty-four-pound\r\nshot; _hull_ the blockheads, whether they will or no. And mind you,\r\nLemsford, when your shot does the most execution, your hear the least\r\nfrom the foe. A killed man cannot even lisp.”\r\n\r\n“Glorious Jack!” cried Lemsford, running up and snatching him by the\r\nhand, “say that again, Jack! look me in the eyes. By all the Homers,\r\nJack, you have made my soul mount like a balloon! Jack, I’m a poor\r\ndevil of a poet. Not two months before I shipped aboard here, I\r\npublished a volume of poems, very aggressive on the world, Jack. Heaven\r\nknows what it cost me. I published it, Jack, and the cursed publisher\r\nsued me for damages; my friends looked sheepish; one or two who liked\r\nit were non-committal; and as for the addle-pated mob and rabble, they\r\nthought they had found out a fool. Blast them, Jack, what they call the\r\npublic is a monster, like the idol we saw in Owhyhee, with the head of\r\na jackass, the body of a baboon, and the tail of a scorpion!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t like that,” said Jack; “when I’m ashore, I myself am part of\r\nthe public.”\r\n\r\n“Your pardon, Jack; you are not, you are then a part of the people,\r\njust as you are aboard the frigate here. The public is one thing, Jack,\r\nand the people another.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said Jack; “right as this leg. Virgil, you are a\r\ntrump; you are a jewel, my boy. The public and the people! Ay, ay, my\r\nlads, let us hate the one and cleave to the other.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\nTHE COMMODORE ON THE POOP, AND ONE OF “THE PEOPLE” UNDER THE HANDS OF\r\nTHE SURGEON.\r\n\r\n\r\nA day or two after the publication of Lemsford’s “Songs of the Sirens,”\r\na sad accident befell a mess-mate of mine, one of the captains of the\r\nmizzen-top. He was a fine little Scot, who, from the premature loss of\r\nthe hair on the top of his head, always went by the name of _Baldy_.\r\nThis baldness was no doubt, in great part, attributable to the same\r\ncause that early thins the locks of most man-of-war’s-men—namely, the\r\nhard, unyielding, and ponderous man-of-war and navy-regulation\r\ntarpaulin hat, which, when new, is stiff enough to sit upon, and\r\nindeed, in lieu of his thumb, sometimes serves the common sailor for a\r\nbench.\r\n\r\nNow, there is nothing upon which the Commodore of a squadron more\r\nprides himself than upon the celerity with which his men can handle the\r\nsails, and go through with all the evolutions pertaining thereto. This\r\nis especially manifested in harbour, when other vessels of his squadron\r\nare near, and perhaps the armed ships of rival nations.\r\n\r\nUpon these occasions, surrounded by his post-captain satraps—each of\r\nwhom in his own floating island is king—the Commodore domineers over\r\nall—emperor of the whole oaken archipelago; yea, magisterial and\r\nmagnificent as the Sultan of the Isles of Sooloo.\r\n\r\nBut, even as so potent an emperor and Caesar to boot as the great Don\r\nof Germany, Charles the Fifth, was used to divert himself in his dotage\r\nby watching the gyrations of the springs and cogs of a long row of\r\nclocks, even so does an elderly Commodore while away his leisure in\r\nharbour, by what is called “_exercising guns_,” and also “_exercising\r\nyards and sails;_” causing the various spars of all the ships under his\r\ncommand to be “braced,” “topped,” and “cock billed” in concert, while\r\nthe Commodore himself sits, something like King Canute, on an arm-chest\r\non the poop of his flag-ship.\r\n\r\nBut far more regal than any descendant of Charlemagne, more haughty\r\nthan any Mogul of the East, and almost mysterious and voiceless in his\r\nauthority as the Great Spirit of the Five Nations, the Commodore deigns\r\nnot to verbalise his commands; they are imparted by signal.\r\n\r\nAnd as for old Charles the Fifth, again, the gay-pranked, coloured\r\nsuits of cards were invented, to while away his dotage, even so,\r\ndoubtless, must these pretty little signals of blue and red spotted\r\n_bunting_ have been devised to cheer the old age of all Commodores.\r\n\r\nBy the Commodore’s side stands the signal-midshipman, with a sea-green\r\nbag swung on his shoulder (as a sportsman bears his game-bag), the\r\nsignal-book in one hand, and the signal spy-glass in the other. As this\r\nsignal-book contains the Masonic signs and tokens of the navy, and\r\nwould therefore be invaluable to an enemy, its binding is always\r\nbordered with lead, so as to insure its sinking in case the ship should\r\nbe captured. Not the only book this, that might appropriately be bound\r\nin lead, though there be many where the author, and not the bookbinder,\r\nfurnishes the metal.\r\n\r\nAs White-Jacket understands it, these signals consist of\r\nvariously-coloured flags, each standing for a certain number. Say there\r\nare ten flags, representing the cardinal numbers—the red flag, No. 1;\r\nthe blue flag, No. 2; the green flag, No. 3, and so forth; then, by\r\nmounting the blue flag over the red, that would stand for No. 21: if\r\nthe green flag were set underneath, it would then stand for 213. How\r\neasy, then, by endless transpositions, to multiply the various numbers\r\nthat may be exhibited at the mizzen-peak, even by only three or four of\r\nthese flags.\r\n\r\nTo each number a particular meaning is applied. No. 100, for instance,\r\nmay mean, “_Beat to quarters_.” No. 150, “_All hands to grog_.” No.\r\n2000, “_Strike top-gallant-yards_.” No. 2110, “_See anything to\r\nwindward?_” No. 2800, “_No_.”\r\n\r\nAnd as every man-of-war is furnished with a signal-book, where all\r\nthese things are set down in order, therefore, though two American\r\nfrigates—almost perfect strangers to each other—came from the opposite\r\nPoles, yet at a distance of more than a mile they could carry on a very\r\nliberal conversation in the air.\r\n\r\nWhen several men-of-war of one nation lie at anchor in one port,\r\nforming a wide circle round their lord and master, the flag-ship, it is\r\na very interesting sight to see them all obeying the Commodore’s\r\norders, who meanwhile never opens his lips.\r\n\r\nThus was it with us in Rio, and hereby hangs the story of my poor\r\nmessmate Bally.\r\n\r\nOne morning, in obedience to a signal from our flag-ship, the various\r\nvessels belonging to the American squadron then in harbour\r\nsimultaneously loosened their sails to dry. In the evening, the signal\r\nwas set to furl them. Upon such occasions, great rivalry exists between\r\nthe First Lieutenants of the different ships; they vie with each other\r\nwho shall first have his sails stowed on the yards. And this rivalry is\r\nshared between all the officers of each vessel, who are respectively\r\nplaced over the different top-men; so that the main-mast is all\r\neagerness to vanquish the fore-mast, and the mizzen-mast to vanquish\r\nthem both. Stimulated by the shouts of their officers, the sailors\r\nthroughout the squadron exert themselves to the utmost.\r\n\r\n“Aloft, topmen! lay out! furl!” cried the First Lieutenant of the\r\nNeversink.\r\n\r\nAt the word the men sprang into the rigging, and on all three masts\r\nwere soon climbing about the yards, in reckless haste, to execute their\r\norders.\r\n\r\nNow, in furling top-sails or courses, the point of honour, and the\r\nhardest work, is in the _bunt_, or middle of the yard; this post\r\nbelongs to the first captain of the top.\r\n\r\n“What are you ’bout there, mizzen-top-men?” roared the First\r\nLieutenant, through his trumpet. “D——n you, you are clumsy as Russian\r\nbears! don’t you see the main—top-men are nearly off the yard? Bear a\r\nhand, bear a hand, or I’ll stop your grog all round! You, Baldy! are\r\nyou going to sleep there in the bunt?”\r\n\r\nWhile this was being said, poor Baldy—his hat off, his face streaming\r\nwith perspiration—was frantically exerting himself, piling up the\r\nponderous folds of canvas in the middle of the yard; ever and anon\r\nglancing at victorious Jack Chase, hard at work at the\r\nmain-top-sail-yard before him.\r\n\r\nAt last, the sail being well piled up, Baldy jumped with both feet into\r\nthe _bunt_, holding on with one hand to the chain “_tie_,” and in that\r\nmanner was violently treading down the canvas, to pack it close.\r\n\r\n“D——n you, Baldy, why don’t you move, you crawling caterpillar;” roared\r\nthe First Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nBaldy brought his whole weight to bear on the rebellious sail, and in\r\nhis frenzied heedlessness let go his hold on the _tie_.\r\n\r\n“You, Baldy! are you afraid of falling?” cried the First Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, with all his force, Baldy jumped down upon the sail;\r\nthe _bunt gasket_ parted; and a dark form dropped through the air.\r\nLighting upon the _top-rim_, it rolled off; and the next instant, with\r\na horrid crash of all his bones, Baldy came, like a thunderbolt, upon\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\nAboard of most large men-of-war there is a stout oaken platform, about\r\nfour feet square, on each side of the quarter-deck. You ascend to it by\r\nthree or four steps; on top, it is railed in at the sides, with\r\nhorizontal brass bars. It is called _the Horse Block;_ and there the\r\nofficer of the deck usually stands, in giving his orders at sea.\r\n\r\nIt was one of these horse blocks, now unoccupied, that broke poor\r\nBaldy’s fall. He fell lengthwise across the brass bars, bending them\r\ninto elbows, and crushing the whole oaken platform, steps and all,\r\nright down to the deck in a thousand splinters.\r\n\r\nHe was picked up for dead, and carried below to the surgeon. His bones\r\nseemed like those of a man broken on the wheel, and no one thought he\r\nwould survive the night. But with the surgeon’s skillful treatment he\r\nsoon promised recovery. Surgeon Cuticle devoted all his science to this\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nA curious frame-work of wood was made for the maimed man; and placed in\r\nthis, with all his limbs stretched out, Baldy lay flat on the floor of\r\nthe Sick-bay, for many weeks. Upon our arrival home, he was able to\r\nhobble ashore on crutches; but from a hale, hearty man, with bronzed\r\ncheeks, he was become a mere dislocated skeleton, white as foam; but\r\nere this, perhaps, his broken bones are healed and whole in the last\r\nrepose of the man-of-war’s-man.\r\n\r\nNot many days after Baldy’s accident in furling sails—in this same\r\nfrenzied manner, under the stimulus of a shouting officer—a seaman fell\r\nfrom the main-royal-yard of an English line-of-battle ship near us, and\r\nburied his ankle-bones in the deck, leaving two indentations there, as\r\nif scooped out by a carpenter’s gouge.\r\n\r\nThe royal-yard forms a cross with the mast, and falling from that lofty\r\ncross in a line-of-battle ship is almost like falling from the cross of\r\nSt. Paul’s; almost like falling as Lucifer from the well-spring of\r\nmorning down to the Phlegethon of night.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, a man, hurled thus from a yard, has fallen upon his own\r\nshipmates in the tops, and dragged them down with him to the same\r\ndestruction with himself.\r\n\r\nHardly ever will you hear of a man-of-war returning home after a\r\ncruise, without the loss of some of her crew from aloft, whereas\r\nsimilar accidents in the merchant service—considering the much greater\r\nnumber of men employed in it—are comparatively few.\r\n\r\nWhy mince the matter? The death of most of these man-of-war’s-men lies\r\nat the door of the souls of those officers, who, while safely standing\r\non deck themselves, scruple not to sacrifice an immortal man or two, in\r\norder to show off the excelling discipline of the ship. And thus do\r\n_the people_ of the gun-deck suffer, that the Commodore on the poop may\r\nbe glorified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\nAN AUCTION IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome allusion has been made to the weariness experienced by the\r\nman-of-war’s-men while lying at anchor; but there are scenes now and\r\nthen that serve to relieve it. Chief among these are the Purser’s\r\nauctions, taking place while in harbour. Some weeks, or perhaps months,\r\nafter a sailor dies in an armed vessel, his bag of clothes is in this\r\nmanner sold, and the proceeds transferred to the account of his heirs\r\nor executors.\r\n\r\nOne of these auctions came off in Rio, shortly after the sad accident\r\nof Baldy.\r\n\r\nIt was a dreamy, quiet afternoon, and the crew were listlessly lying\r\naround, when suddenly the Boatswain’s whistle was heard, followed by\r\nthe announcement, “D’ye hear there, fore and aft? Purser’s auction on\r\nthe spar-deck!”\r\n\r\nAt the sound, the sailors sprang to their feet and mustered round the\r\nmain-mast. Presently up came the Purser’s steward, marshalling before\r\nhim three or four of his subordinates, carrying several clothes’ bags,\r\nwhich were deposited at the base of the mast.\r\n\r\nOur Purser’s steward was a rather gentlemanly man in his way. Like many\r\nyoung Americans of his class, he had at various times assumed the most\r\nopposite functions for a livelihood, turning from one to the other with\r\nall the facility of a light-hearted, clever adventurer. He had been a\r\nclerk in a steamer on the Mississippi River; an auctioneer in Ohio; a\r\nstock actor at the Olympic Theatre in New York; and now he was Purser’s\r\nsteward in the Navy. In the course of this deversified career his\r\nnatural wit and waggery had been highly spiced, and every way improved;\r\nand he had acquired the last and most difficult art of the joker, the\r\nart of lengthening his own face while widening those of his hearers,\r\npreserving the utmost solemnity while setting them all in a roar. He\r\nwas quite a favourite with the sailors, which, in a good degree, was\r\nowing to his humour; but likewise to his off-hand, irresistible,\r\nromantic, theatrical manner of addressing them.\r\n\r\nWith a dignified air, he now mounted the pedestal of the main-top-sail\r\nsheet-bitts, imposing silence by a theatrical wave of his hand;\r\nmeantime, his subordinates were rummaging the bags, and assorting their\r\ncontents before him.\r\n\r\n“Now, my noble hearties,” he began, “we will open this auction by\r\noffering to your impartial competition a very superior pair of old\r\nboots;” and so saying, he dangled aloft one clumsy cowhide cylinder,\r\nalmost as large as a fire bucket, as a specimen of the complete pair.\r\n\r\n“What shall I have now, my noble tars, for this superior pair of\r\nsea-boots?”\r\n\r\n“Where’s t’other boot?” cried a suspicious-eyed waister. “I remember\r\nthem ’ere boots. They were old Bob’s the quarter-gunner’s; there was\r\ntwo on ’em, too. I want to see t’other boot.”\r\n\r\n“My sweet and pleasant fellow,” said the auctioneer, with his blandest\r\naccents, “the other boot is not just at hand, but I give you my word of\r\nhonour that it in all respects corresponds to the one you here see—it\r\ndoes, I assure you. And I solemnly guarantee, my noble sea-faring\r\nfencibles,” he added, turning round upon all, “that the other boot is\r\nthe exact counterpart of this. Now, then, say the word, my fine\r\nfellows. What shall I have? Ten dollars, did you say?” politely bowing\r\ntoward some indefinite person in the background.\r\n\r\n“No; ten cents,” responded a voice.\r\n\r\n“Ten cents! ten cents! gallant sailors, for this noble pair of boots,”\r\nexclaimed the auctioneer, with affected horror; “I must close the\r\nauction, my tars of Columbia; this will never do. But let’s have\r\nanother bid; now, come,” he added, coaxingly and soothingly. “What is\r\nit? One dollar, one dollar then—one dollar; going at one dollar; going,\r\ngoing—going. Just see how it vibrates”—swinging the boot to and\r\nfro—“this superior pair of sea-boots vibrating at one dollar; wouldn’t\r\npay for the nails in their heels; going, going—gone!” And down went the\r\nboots.\r\n\r\n“Ah, what a sacrifice! what a sacrifice!” he sighed, tearfully eyeing\r\nthe solitary fire-bucket, and then glancing round the company for\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\n“A sacrifice, indeed!” exclaimed Jack Chase, who stood by; “Purser’s\r\nSteward, you are Mark Antony over the body of Julius Cesar.”\r\n\r\n“So I am, so I am,” said the auctioneer, without moving a muscle. “And\r\nlook!” he exclaimed, suddenly seizing the boot, and exhibiting it on\r\nhigh, “look, my noble tars, if you have tears, prepare to shed them\r\nnow. You all do know this boot. I remember the first time ever old Bob\r\nput it on. ’Twas on a winter evening, off Cape Horn, between the\r\nstarboard carronades—that day his precious grog was stopped. Look! in\r\nthis place a mouse has nibbled through; see what a rent some envious\r\nrat has made, through this another filed, and, as he plucked his cursed\r\nrasp away, mark how the bootleg gaped. This was the unkindest cut of\r\nall. But whose are the boots?” suddenly assuming a business-like air;\r\n“yours? yours? yours?”\r\n\r\nBut not a friend of the lamented Bob stood by.\r\n\r\n“Tars of Columbia,” said the auctioneer, imperatively, “these boots\r\nmust be sold; and if I can’t sell them one way, I must sell them\r\nanother. How much _a pound_, now, for this superior pair of old boots?\r\ngoing by _the pound_ now, remember, my gallant sailors! what shall I\r\nhave? one cent, do I hear? going now at one cent a\r\npound—going—going—going—_gone!_”\r\n\r\n“Whose are they? Yours, Captain of the Waist? Well, my sweet and\r\npleasant friend, I will have them weighed out to you when the auction\r\nis over.”\r\n\r\nIn like manner all the contents of the bags were disposed of, embracing\r\nold frocks, trowsers, and jackets, the various sums for which they went\r\nbeing charged to the bidders on the books of the Purser.\r\n\r\nHaving been present at this auction, though not a purchaser, and seeing\r\nwith what facility the most dismantled old garments went off, through\r\nthe magical cleverness of the accomplished auctioneer, the thought\r\noccurred to me, that if ever I calmly and positively decided to dispose\r\nof my famous white jacket, this would be the very way to do it. I\r\nturned the matter over in my mind a long time.\r\n\r\nThe weather in Rio was genial and warm, and that I would ever again\r\nneed such a thing as a heavy quilted jacket—and such a jacket as the\r\nwhite one, too—seemed almost impossible. Yet I remembered the American\r\ncoast, and that it would probably be Autumn when we should arrive\r\nthere. Yes, I thought of all that, to be sure; nevertheless, the\r\nungovernable whim seized me to sacrifice my jacket and recklessly abide\r\nthe consequences. Besides, was it not a horrible jacket? To how many\r\nannoyances had it subjected me? How many scrapes had it dragged me\r\ninto? Nay, had it not once jeopardised my very existence? And I had a\r\ndreadful presentiment that, if I persisted in retaining it, it would do\r\nso again. Enough! I will sell it, I muttered; and so muttering, I\r\nthrust my hands further down in my waistband, and walked the main-top\r\nin the stern concentration of an inflexible purpose. Next day, hearing\r\nthat another auction was shortly to take place, I repaired to the\r\noffice of the Purser’s steward, with whom I was upon rather friendly\r\nterms. After vaguely and delicately hinting at the object of my visit,\r\nI came roundly to the point, and asked him whether he could slip my\r\njacket into one of the bags of clothes next to be sold, and so dispose\r\nof it by public auction. He kindly acquiesced and the thing was done.\r\n\r\nIn due time all hands were again summoned round the main-mast; the\r\nPurser’s steward mounted his post, and the ceremony began. Meantime, I\r\nlingered out of sight, but still within hearing, on the gun-deck below,\r\ngazing up, un-perceived, at the scene.\r\n\r\nAs it is now so long ago, I will here frankly make confession that I\r\nhad privately retained the services of a friend—Williams, the Yankee\r\npedagogue and peddler—whose business it would be to linger near the\r\nscene of the auction, and, if the bids on the jacket loitered, to start\r\nit roundly himself; and if the bidding then became brisk, he was\r\ncontinually to strike in with the most pertinacious and infatuated\r\nbids, and so exasperate competition into the maddest and most\r\nextravagant overtures.\r\n\r\nA variety of other articles having been put up, the white jacket was\r\nslowly produced, and, held high aloft between the auctioneer’s thumb\r\nand fore-finger, was submitted to the inspection of the discriminating\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nHere it behooves me once again to describe my jacket; for, as a\r\nportrait taken at one period of life will not answer for a later stage;\r\nmuch more this jacket of mine, undergoing so many changes, needs to be\r\npainted again and again, in order truly to present its actual\r\nappearance at any given period.\r\n\r\nA premature old age had now settled upon it; all over it bore\r\nmelancholy sears of the masoned-up pockets that had once trenched it in\r\nvarious directions. Some parts of it were slightly mildewed from\r\ndampness; on one side several of the buttons were gone, and others were\r\nbroken or cracked; while, alas! my many mad endeavours to rub it black\r\non the decks had now imparted to the whole garment an exceedingly\r\nuntidy appearance. Such as it was, with all its faults, the auctioneer\r\ndisplayed it.\r\n\r\n“You, venerable sheet-anchor-men! and you, gallant fore-top-men! and\r\nyou, my fine waisters! what do you say now for this superior old\r\njacket? Buttons and sleeves, lining and skirts, it must this day be\r\nsold without reservation. How much for it, my gallant tars of Columbia?\r\nsay the word, and how much?”\r\n\r\n“My eyes!” exclaimed a fore-top-man, “don’t that ’ere bunch of old\r\nswabs belong to Jack Chase’s pet? Aren’t that _the white jacket?_”\r\n\r\n“_The white jacket!_” cried fifty voices in response; “_the white\r\njacket!_” The cry ran fore and aft the ship like a slogan, completely\r\noverwhelming the solitary voice of my private friend Williams, while\r\nall hands gazed at it with straining eyes, wondering how it came among\r\nthe bags of deceased mariners.\r\n\r\n“Ay, noble tars,” said the auctioneer, “you may well stare at it; you\r\nwill not find another jacket like this on either side of Cape Horn, I\r\nassure you. Why, just look at it! How much, now? _Give_ me a bid—but\r\ndon’t be rash; be prudent, be prudent, men; remember your Purser’s\r\naccounts, and don’t be betrayed into extravagant bids.”\r\n\r\n“Purser’s Steward!” cried Grummet, one of the quarter-gunners, slowly\r\nshifting his quid from one cheek to the other, like a ballast-stone, “I\r\nwon’t bid on that ’ere bunch of old swabs, unless you put up ten pounds\r\nof soap with it.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t mind that old fellow,” said the auctioneer. “How much for the\r\njacket, my noble tars?”\r\n\r\n“Jacket;” cried a dandy _bone polisher_ of the gun-room. “The\r\nsail-maker was the tailor, then. How many fathoms of canvas in it,\r\nPurser’s Steward?”\r\n\r\n“How much for this _jacket_?” reiterated the auctioneer, emphatically.\r\n\r\n“_Jacket_, do you call it!” cried a captain of the hold.\r\n\r\n“Why not call it a white-washed man-of-war schooner? Look at the\r\nport-holes, to let in the air of cold nights.”\r\n\r\n“A reg’lar herring-net,” chimed in Grummet.\r\n\r\n“Gives me the _fever nagur_ to look at it,” echoed a mizzen-top-man.\r\n\r\n“Silence!” cried the auctioneer. “Start it now—start it, boys; anything\r\nyou please, my fine fellows! it _must_ be sold. Come, what ought I to\r\nhave on it, now?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Purser’s Steward,” cried a waister, “you ought to have new\r\nsleeves, a new lining, and a new body on it, afore you try to shove it\r\noff on a greenhorn.”\r\n\r\n“What are you, ‘busin’ that ’ere garment for?” cried an old\r\nsheet-anchor-man. “Don’t you see it’s a ‘uniform mustering\r\njacket’—three buttons on one side, and none on t’other?”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” again cried the auctioneer. “How much, my sea-fencibles, for\r\nthis superior old jacket?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Grummet, “I’ll take it for cleaning-rags at one cent.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come, give us a bid! say something, Colombians.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” said Grummet, all at once bursting into genuine\r\nindignation, “if you want us to say something, then heave that bunch of\r\nold swabs overboard, _say I_, and show us something worth looking at.”\r\n\r\n“No one will give me a bid, then? Very good; here, shove it aside.\r\nLet’s have something else there.”\r\n\r\nWhile this scene was going forward, and my white jacket was thus being\r\nabused, how my heart swelled within me! Thrice was I on the point of\r\nrushing out of my hiding-place, and bearing it off from derision; but I\r\nlingered, still flattering myself that all would be well, and the\r\njacket find a purchaser at last. But no, alas! there was no getting rid\r\nof it, except by rolling a forty-two-pound shot in it, and committing\r\nit to the deep. But though, in my desperation, I had once contemplated\r\nsomething of that sort, yet I had now become unaccountably averse to\r\nit, from certain involuntary superstitious considerations. If I sink my\r\njacket, thought I, it will be sure to spread itself into a bed at the\r\nbottom of the sea, upon which I shall sooner or later recline, a dead\r\nman. So, unable to conjure it into the possession of another, and\r\nwithheld from burying it out of sight for ever, my jacket stuck to me\r\nlike the fatal shirt on Nessus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\nPURSER, PURSER’S STEWARD, AND POSTMASTER IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Purser’s steward so conspicuously figured at the unsuccessful\r\nauction of my jacket, it reminds me of how important a personage that\r\nofficial is on board of all men-of-war. He is the right-hand man and\r\nconfidential deputy and clerk of the Purser, who intrusts to him all\r\nhis accounts with the crew, while, in most cases, he himself, snug and\r\ncomfortable in his state-room, glances over a file of newspapers\r\ninstead of overhauling his ledgers.\r\n\r\nOf all the non-combatants of a man-of-war, the Purser, perhaps, stands\r\nforemost in importance. Though he is but a member of the gun-room mess,\r\nyet usage seems to assign him a conventional station somewhat above\r\nthat of his equals in navy rank—the Chaplain, Surgeon, and Professor.\r\nMoreover, he is frequently to be seen in close conversation with the\r\nCommodore, who, in the Neversink, was more than once known to be\r\nslightly jocular with our Purser. Upon several occasions, also, he was\r\ncalled into the Commodore’s cabin, and remained closeted there for\r\nseveral minutes together. Nor do I remember that there ever happened a\r\ncabinet meeting of the ward-room barons, the Lieutenants, in the\r\nCommodore’s cabin, but the Purser made one of the party. Doubtless the\r\nimportant fact of the Purser having under his charge all the financial\r\naffairs of a man-of-war, imparts to him the great importance he enjoys.\r\nIndeed, we find in every government—monarchies and republics alike—that\r\nthe personage at the head of the finances invariably occupies a\r\ncommanding position. Thus, in point of station, the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury of the United States is deemed superior to the other heads of\r\ndepartments. Also, in England, the real office held by the great\r\nPremier himself is—as every one knows—that of First Lord of the\r\nTreasury.\r\n\r\nNow, under this high functionary of state, the official known as the\r\nPurser’s Steward was head clerk of the frigate’s fiscal affairs. Upon\r\nthe berth-deck he had a regular counting-room, full of ledgers,\r\njournals, and day-books. His desk was as much littered with papers as\r\nany Pearl Street merchant’s, and much time was devoted to his accounts.\r\nFor hours together you would see him, through the window of his\r\nsubterranean office, writing by the light of his perpetual lamp.\r\n\r\n_Ex-officio_, the Purser’s Steward of most ships is a sort of\r\npostmaster, and his office the post-office. When the letter-bags for\r\nthe squadron—almost as large as those of the United States mail—arrived\r\non board the Neversink, it was the Purser’s Steward that sat at his\r\nlittle window on the berth-deck and handed you your letter or paper—if\r\nany there were to your address. Some disappointed applicants among the\r\nsailors would offer to buy the epistles of their more fortunate\r\nshipmates, while yet the seal was unbroken—maintaining that the sole\r\nand confidential reading of a fond, long, domestic letter from any\r\nman’s home, was far better than no letter at all.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of the office of the Purser’s Steward are the principal\r\nstore-rooms of the Purser, where large quantities of goods of every\r\ndescription are to be found. On board of those ships where goods are\r\npermitted to be served out to the crew for the purpose of selling them\r\nashore, to raise money, more business is transacted at the office of a\r\nPurser’s Steward in one _Liberty-day_ morning than all the dry goods\r\nshops in a considerable village would transact in a week.\r\n\r\nOnce a month, with undeviating regularity, this official has his hands\r\nmore than usually full. For, once a month, certain printed bills,\r\ncalled Mess-bills, are circulated among the crew, and whatever you may\r\nwant from the Purser—be it tobacco, soap, duck, dungaree, needles,\r\nthread, knives, belts, calico, ribbon, pipes, paper, pens, hats, ink,\r\nshoes, socks, or whatever it may be—down it goes on the mess-bill,\r\nwhich, being the next day returned to the office of the Steward, the\r\n“slops,” as they are called, are served out to the men and charged to\r\ntheir accounts.\r\n\r\nLucky is it for man-of-war’s-men that the outrageous impositions to\r\nwhich, but a very few years ago, they were subjected from the abuses in\r\nthis department of the service, and the unscrupulous cupidity of many\r\nof the pursers—lucky is it for them that _now_ these things are in a\r\ngreat degree done away. The Pursers, instead of being at liberty to\r\nmake almost what they pleased from the sale of their wares, are now\r\npaid by regular stipends laid down by law.\r\n\r\nUnder the exploded system, the profits of some of these officers were\r\nalmost incredible. In one cruise up the Mediterranean, the Purser of an\r\nAmerican line-of-battle ship was, on good authority, said to have\r\ncleared the sum of $50,000. Upon that he quitted the service, and\r\nretired into the country. Shortly after, his three daughters—not very\r\nlovely—married extremely well.\r\n\r\nThe ideas that sailors entertain of Pursers is expressed in a rather\r\ninelegant but expressive saying of theirs: “The Purser is a conjurer;\r\nhe can make a dead man chew tobacco”—insinuating that the accounts of a\r\ndead man are sometimes subjected to post-mortem charges. Among sailors,\r\nalso, Pursers commonly go by the name of _nip-cheeses_.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that on board of the old frigate Java, upon her return from a\r\ncruise extending over a period of more than four years, one thousand\r\ndollars paid off eighty of her crew, though the aggregate wages of the\r\neighty for the voyage must have amounted to about sixty thousand\r\ndollars. Even under the present system, the Purser of a line-of-battle\r\nship, for instance, is far better paid than any other officer, short of\r\nCaptain or Commodore. While the Lieutenant commonly receives but\r\neighteen hundred dollars, the Surgeon of the fleet but fifteen hundred,\r\nthe Chaplain twelve hundred, the Purser of a line-of-battle ship\r\nreceives thirty-five hundred dollars. In considering his salary,\r\nhowever, his responsibilities are not to be over-looked; they are by no\r\nmeans insignificant.\r\n\r\nThere are Pursers in the Navy whom the sailors exempt from the\r\ninsinuations above mentioned, nor, as a class, are they so obnoxious to\r\nthem now as formerly; for one, the florid old Purser of the\r\nNeversink—never coming into disciplinary contact with the seamen, and\r\nbeing withal a jovial and apparently good-hearted gentleman—was\r\nsomething of a favourite with many of the crew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\nNEVERSINK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile lying in the harbour of Callao, in Peru, certain rumours had come\r\nto us touching a war with England, growing out of the long-vexed\r\nNortheastern Boundary Question. In Rio these rumours were increased;\r\nand the probability of hostilities induced our Commodore to authorize\r\nproceedings that closely brought home to every man on board the\r\nNeversink his liability at any time to be killed at his gun.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, a number of men were detailed to pass up the rusty\r\ncannon-balls from the shot-lockers in the hold, and scrape them clean\r\nfor service. The Commodore was a very neat gentleman, and would not\r\nfire a dirty shot into his foe.\r\n\r\nIt was an interesting occasion for a tranquil observer; nor was it\r\naltogether neglected. Not to recite the precise remarks made by the\r\nseamen while pitching the shot up the hatchway from hand to hand, like\r\nschoolboys playing ball ashore, it will be enough to say that, from the\r\ngeneral drift of their discourse—jocular as it was—it was manifest\r\nthat, almost to a man, they abhorred the idea of going into action.\r\n\r\nAnd why should they desire a war? Would their wages be raised? Not a\r\ncent. The prize-money, though, ought to have been an inducement. But of\r\nall the “rewards of virtue,” prize-money is the most uncertain; and\r\nthis the man-of-war’s-man knows. What, then, has he to expect from war?\r\nWhat but harder work, and harder usage than in peace; a wooden leg or\r\narm; mortal wounds, and death? Enough, however, that by far the\r\nmajority of the common sailors of the Neversink were plainly concerned\r\nat the prospect of war, and were plainly averse to it.\r\n\r\nBut with the officers of the quarter-deck it was just the reverse. None\r\nof them, to be sure, in my hearing at least, verbally expressed their\r\ngratification; but it was unavoidably betrayed by the increased\r\ncheerfulness of their demeanour toward each other, their frequent\r\nfraternal conferences, and their unwonted animation for several clays\r\nin issuing their orders. The voice of Mad Jack—always a belfry to\r\nhear—now resounded like that famous bell of England, Great Tom of\r\nOxford. As for Selvagee, he wore his sword with a jaunty air, and his\r\nservant daily polished the blade.\r\n\r\nBut why this contrast between the forecastle and the quarter-deck,\r\nbetween the man-of-war’s-man and his officer? Because, though war would\r\nequally jeopardize the lives of both, yet, while it held out to the\r\nsailor no promise of promotion, and what is called _glory_, these\r\nthings fired the breast of his officers.\r\n\r\nIt is no pleasing task, nor a thankful one, to dive into the souls of\r\nsome men; but there are occasions when, to bring up the mud from the\r\nbottom, reveals to us on what soundings we are, on what coast we\r\nadjoin.\r\n\r\nHow were these officers to gain glory? How but by a distinguished\r\nslaughtering of their fellow-men. How were they to be promoted? How but\r\nover the buried heads of killed comrades and mess-mates.\r\n\r\nThis hostile contrast between the feelings with which the common seamen\r\nand the officers of the Neversink looked forward to this more than\r\npossible war, is one of many instances that might be quoted to show the\r\nantagonism of their interests, the incurable antagonism in which they\r\ndwell. But can men, whose interests are diverse, ever hope to live\r\ntogether in a harmony uncoerced? Can the brotherhood of the race of\r\nmankind ever hope to prevail in a man-of-war, where one man’s bane is\r\nalmost another’s blessing? By abolishing the scourge, shall we do away\r\ntyranny; _that_ tyranny which must ever prevail, where of two\r\nessentially antagonistic classes in perpetual contact, one is\r\nimmeasurably the stronger? Surely it seems all but impossible. And as\r\nthe very object of a man-of-war, as its name implies, is to fight the\r\nvery battles so naturally averse to the seamen; so long as a man-of-war\r\nexists, it must ever remain a picture of much that is tyrannical and\r\nrepelling in human nature.\r\n\r\nBeing an establishment much more extensive than the American Navy, the\r\nEnglish armed marine furnishes a yet more striking example of this\r\nthing, especially as the existence of war produces so vast an\r\naugmentation of her naval force compared with what it is in time of\r\npeace. It is well known what joy the news of Bonaparte’s sudden return\r\nfrom Elba created among crowds of British naval officers, who had\r\npreviously been expecting to be sent ashore on half-pay. Thus, when all\r\nthe world wailed, these officers found occasion for thanksgiving. I\r\nurge it not against them as men—their feelings belonged to their\r\nprofession. Had they not been naval officers, they had not been\r\nrejoicers in the midst of despair.\r\n\r\nWhen shall the time come, how much longer will God postpone it, when\r\nthe clouds, which at times gather over the horizons of nations, shall\r\nnot be hailed by any class of humanity, and invoked to burst as a bomb?\r\nStanding navies, as well as standing armies, serve to keep alive the\r\nspirit of war even in the meek heart of peace. In its very embers and\r\nsmoulderings, they nourish that fatal fire, and half-pay officers, as\r\nthe priests of Mars, yet guard the temple, though no god be there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\nTHE BAY OF ALL BEAUTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have said that I must pass over Rio without a description; but just\r\nnow such a flood of scented reminiscences steals over me, that I must\r\nneeds yield and recant, as I inhale that musky air.\r\n\r\nMore than one hundred and fifty miles’ circuit of living green hills\r\nembosoms a translucent expanse, so gemmed in by sierras of grass, that\r\namong the Indian tribes the place was known as “The Hidden Water.” On\r\nall sides, in the distance, rise high conical peaks, which at sunrise\r\nand sunset burn like vast tapers; and down from the interior, through\r\nvineyards and forests, flow radiating streams, all emptying into the\r\nharbour.\r\n\r\nTalk not of Bahia de Todos os Santos—the Bay of All Saints; for though\r\nthat be a glorious haven, yet Rio is the Bay of all Rivers—the Bay of\r\nall Delights—the Bay of all Beauties. From circumjacent hillsides,\r\nuntiring summer hangs perpetually in terraces of vivid verdure; and,\r\nembossed with old mosses, convent and castle nestle in valley and glen.\r\n\r\nAll round, deep inlets run into the green mountain land, and, overhung\r\nwith wild Highlands, more resemble Loch Katrines than Lake Lemans. And\r\nthough Loch Katrine has been sung by the bonneted Scott, and Lake Leman\r\nby the coroneted Byron; yet here, in Rio, both the loch and the lake\r\nare but two wild flowers in a prospect that is almost unlimited. For,\r\nbehold! far away and away, stretches the broad blue of the water, to\r\nyonder soft-swelling hills of light green, backed by the purple\r\npinnacles and pipes of the grand Organ Mountains; fitly so called, for\r\nin thunder-time they roll cannonades down the bay, drowning the blended\r\nbass of all the cathedrals in Rio. Shout amain, exalt your voices,\r\nstamp your feet, jubilate, Organ Mountains! and roll your Te Deums\r\nround the world!\r\n\r\nWhat though, for more than five thousand five hundred years, this grand\r\nharbour of Rio lay hid in the hills, unknown by the Catholic\r\nPortuguese? Centuries ere Haydn performed before emperors and kings,\r\nthese Organ Mountains played his Oratorio of the Creation, before the\r\nCreator himself. But nervous Haydn could not have endured that\r\ncannonading choir, since this composer of thunderbolts himself died at\r\nlast through the crashing commotion of Napoleon’s bombardment of\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nBut all mountains are Organ Mountains: the Alps and the Himalayas; the\r\nAppalachian Chain, the Ural, the Andes, the Green Hills and the White.\r\nAll of them play anthems forever: The Messiah, and Samson, and Israel\r\nin Egypt, and Saul, and Judas Maccabeus, and Solomon.\r\n\r\nArchipelago Rio! ere Noah on old Ararat anchored his ark, there lay\r\nanchored in you all these green, rocky isles I now see. But God did not\r\nbuild on you, isles! those long lines of batteries; nor did our blessed\r\nSaviour stand godfather at the christening of yon frowning fortress of\r\nSanta Cruz, though named in honour of himself, the divine Prince of\r\nPeace!\r\n\r\nAmphitheatrical Rio! in your broad expanse might be held the\r\nResurrection and Judgment-day of the whole world’s men-of-war,\r\nrepresented by the flag-ships of fleets—the flag-ships of the\r\nPhoenician armed galleys of Tyre and Sidon; of King Solomon’s annual\r\nsquadrons that sailed to Ophir; whence in after times, perhaps, sailed\r\nthe Acapulco fleets of the Spaniards, with golden ingots for\r\nballasting; the flag-ships of all the Greek and Persian craft that\r\nexchanged the war-hug at Salamis; of all the Roman and Egyptian galleys\r\nthat, eagle-like, with blood-dripping prows, beaked each other at\r\nActium; of all the Danish keels of the Vikings; of all the musquito\r\ncraft of Abba Thule, king of the Pelaws, when he went to vanquish\r\nArtinsall; of all the Venetian, Genoese, and Papal fleets that came to\r\nthe shock at Lepanto; of both horns of the crescent of the Spanish\r\nArmada; of the Portuguese squadron that, under the gallant Gama,\r\nchastised the Moors, and discovered the Moluccas; of all the Dutch\r\nnavies red by Van Tromp, and sunk by Admiral Hawke; of the forty-seven\r\nFrench and Spanish sail-of-the-line that, for three months, essayed to\r\nbatter down Gibraltar; of all Nelson’s seventy-fours that\r\nthunder-bolted off St. Vincent’s, at the Nile, Copenhagen, and\r\nTrafalgar; of all the frigate-merchantmen of the East India Company; of\r\nPerry’s war-brigs, sloops, and schooners that scattered the British\r\narmament on Lake Erie; of all the Barbary corsairs captured by\r\nBainbridge; of the war-canoes of the Polynesian kings, Tammahammaha and\r\nPomare—ay! one and all, with Commodore Noah for their Lord High\r\nAdmiral—in this abounding Bay of Rio these flag-ships might all come to\r\nanchor, and swing round in concert to the first of the flood.\r\n\r\nRio is a small Mediterranean; and what was fabled of the entrance to\r\nthat sea, in Rio is partly made true; for here, at the mouth, stands\r\none of Hercules’ Pillars, the Sugar-Loaf Mountain, one thousand feet\r\nhigh, inclining over a little, like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. At its\r\nbase crouch, like mastiffs, the batteries of Jose and Theodosia; while\r\nopposite, you are menaced by a rock-founded fort.\r\n\r\nThe channel between—the sole inlet to the bay—seems but a biscuit’s\r\ntoss over; you see naught of the land-locked sea within till fairly in\r\nthe strait. But, then, what a sight is beheld! Diversified as the\r\nharbour of Constantinople, but a thousand-fold grander. When the\r\nNeversink swept in, word was passed, “Aloft, top-men! and furl\r\nt’-gallant-sails and royals!”\r\n\r\nAt the sound I sprang into the rigging, and was soon at my perch. How I\r\nhung over that main-royal-yard in a rapture High in air, poised over\r\nthat magnificent bay, a new world to my ravished eyes, I felt like the\r\nforemost of a flight of angels, new-lighted upon earth, from some star\r\nin the Milky Way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\nONE OF “THE PEOPLE” HAS AN AUDIENCE WITH THE COMMODORE AND THE CAPTAIN\r\nON THE QUARTER-DECK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had not lain in Rio long, when in the innermost recesses of the\r\nmighty soul of my noble Captain of the Top—incomparable Jack Chase—the\r\ndeliberate opinion was formed, and rock-founded, that our ship’s\r\ncompany must have at least one day’s “_liberty_” to go ashore ere we\r\nweighed anchor for home.\r\n\r\nHere it must be mentioned that, concerning anything of this kind, no\r\nsailor in a man-of-war ever presumes to be an agitator, unless he is of\r\na rank superior to a mere able-seaman; and no one short of a petty\r\nofficer—that is, a captain of the top, a quarter-gunner, or boatswain’s\r\nmate—ever dreams of being a spokesman to the supreme authority of the\r\nvessel in soliciting any kind of favor for himself and shipmates.\r\n\r\nAfter canvassing the matter thoroughly with several old quarter-masters\r\nand other dignified sea-fencibles, Jack, hat in hand, made his\r\nappearance, one fine evening, at the mast, and, waiting till Captain\r\nClaret drew nigh, bowed, and addressed him in his own off-hand,\r\npolished, and poetical style. In his intercourse with the quarter-deck,\r\nhe always presumed upon his being such a universal favourite.\r\n\r\n“Sir, this Rio is a charming harbour, and we poor mariners—your trusty\r\nsea-warriors, valiant Captain! who, with _you_ at their head, would\r\nboard the Rock of Gibraltar itself, and carry it by storm—we poor\r\nfellows, valiant Captain! have gazed round upon this ravishing\r\nlandscape till we can gaze no more. Will Captain Claret vouchsafe one\r\nday’s liberty, and so assure himself of eternal felicity, since, in our\r\nflowing cups, he will be ever after freshly remembered?”\r\n\r\nAs Jack thus rounded off with a snatch from Shakspeare, he saluted the\r\nCaptain with a gallant flourish of his tarpaulin, and then, bringing\r\nthe rim to his mouth, with his head bowed, and his body thrown into a\r\nfine negligent attitude, stood a picture of eloquent but passive\r\nappeal. He seemed to say, Magnanimous Captain Claret, we fine fellows,\r\nand hearts of oak, throw ourselves upon your unparalleled goodness.\r\n\r\n“And what do you want to go ashore for?” asked the Captain, evasively,\r\nand trying to conceal his admiration of Jack by affecting some\r\nhaughtiness.\r\n\r\n“Ah! sir,” sighed Jack, “why do the thirsty camels of the desert desire\r\nto lap the waters of the fountain and roll in the green grass of the\r\noasis? Are we not but just from the ocean Sahara? and is not this Rio a\r\nverdant spot, noble Captain? Surely you will not keep us always\r\ntethered at anchor, when a little more cable would admit of our\r\ncropping the herbage! And it is a weary thing, Captain Claret, to be\r\nimprisoned month after month on the gun-deck, without so much as\r\nsmelling a citron. Ah! Captain Claret, what sings sweet Waller:\r\n\r\n     ‘But who can always on the billows lie?\r\n      The watery wilderness yields no supply.’\r\n\r\n\r\ncompared with such a prisoner, noble Captain,\r\n\r\n     ‘Happy, thrice happy, who, in battle slain,\r\n      Press’d in Atrides’ cause the Trojan pain!’\r\n\r\n\r\nPope’s version, sir, not the original Greek.”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, Jack once more brought his hat-rim to his mouth, and\r\nslightly bending forward, stood mute.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the Most Serene Commodore himself happened to emerge\r\nfrom the after-gangway, his gilded buttons, epaulets, and the gold lace\r\non his chapeau glittering in the flooding sunset. Attracted by the\r\nscene between Captain Claret and so well-known and admired a commoner\r\nas Jack Chase he approached, and assuming for the moment an air of\r\npleasant condescension—never shown to his noble barons the officers of\r\nthe ward-room—he said, with a smile, “Well, Jack, you and your\r\nshipmates are after some favour, I suppose—a day’s liberty, is it not?”\r\n\r\nWhether it was the horizontal setting sun, streaming along the deck,\r\nthat blinded Jack, or whether it was in sun-worshipping homage of the\r\nmighty Commodore, there is no telling; but just at this juncture noble\r\nJack was standing reverentially holding his hat to his brow, like a man\r\nwith weak eyes.\r\n\r\n“Valiant Commodore,” said he, at last, “this audience is indeed an\r\nhonour undeserved. I almost sink beneath it. Yes, valiant Commodore,\r\nyour sagacious mind has truly divined our object. Liberty, sir; liberty\r\nis, indeed, our humble prayer. I trust your honourable wound, received\r\nin glorious battle, valiant Comodore, pains you less today than\r\ncommon.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! cunning Jack!” cried the Commodore, by no means blind to the bold\r\nsortie of his flattery, but not at all displeased with it. In more\r\nrespects than one, our Commodore’s wound was his weak side.\r\n\r\n“I think we must give them liberty,” he added, turning to Captain\r\nClaret; who thereupon, waving Jack further off, fell into confidential\r\ndiscourse with his superior.\r\n\r\n“Well, Jack, we will see about it,” at last cried the Commodore,\r\nadvancing. “I think we must let you go.”\r\n\r\n“To your duty, captain of the main-top!” said the Captain, rather\r\nstiffly. He wished to neutralise somewhat the effect of the Commodore’s\r\ncondescension. Besides, he had much rather the Commodore had been in\r\nhis cabin. His presence, for the time, affected his own supremacy in\r\nhis ship. But Jack was nowise cast down by the Captain’s coldness; he\r\nfelt safe enough; so he proceeded to offer his acknowledgments.\r\n\r\n“‘Kind gentlemen,’” he sighed, “‘your pains are registered where every\r\nday I turn the leaf to read,’—Macbeth, valiant Commodore and\r\nCaptain!—what the Thane says to the noble lords, Ross and Angus.”\r\n\r\nAnd long and lingeringly bowing to the two noble officers, Jack backed\r\naway from their presence, still shading his eyes with the broad rim of\r\nhis hat.\r\n\r\n“Jack Chase for ever!” cried his shipmates, as he carried the grateful\r\nnews of liberty to them on the forecastle. “Who can talk to Commodores\r\nlike our matchless Jack!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\nSOMETHING CONCERNING MIDSHIPMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the next morning after matchless Jack’s interview with the\r\nCommodore and Captain, that a little incident occurred, soon forgotten\r\nby the crew at large, but long remembered by the few seamen who were in\r\nthe habit of closely scrutinising every-day proceedings. Upon the face\r\nof it, it was but a common event—at least in a man-of-war—the flogging\r\nof a man at the gangway. But the under-current of circumstances in the\r\ncase were of a nature that magnified this particular flogging into a\r\nmatter of no small importance. The story itself cannot here be related;\r\nit would not well bear recital: enough that the person flogged was a\r\nmiddle-aged man of the Waist—a forlorn, broken-down, miserable object,\r\ntruly; one of those wretched landsmen sometimes driven into the Navy by\r\ntheir unfitness for all things else, even as others are driven into the\r\nworkhouse. He was flogged at the complaint of a midshipman; and hereby\r\nhangs the drift of the thing. For though this waister was so ignoble a\r\nmortal, yet his being scourged on this one occasion indirectly\r\nproceeded from the mere wanton spite and unscrupulousness of the\r\nmidshipman in question—a youth, who was apt to indulge at times in\r\nundignified familiarities with some of the men, who, sooner or later,\r\nalmost always suffered from his capricious preferences.\r\n\r\nBut the leading principle that was involved in this affair is far too\r\nmischievous to be lightly dismissed.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, it would seem to be a cardinal principle with a Navy\r\nCaptain that his subordinates are disintegrated parts of himself,\r\ndetached from the main body on special service, and that the order of\r\nthe minutest midshipman must be as deferentially obeyed by the seamen\r\nas if proceeding from the Commodore on the poop. This principle was\r\nonce emphasised in a remarkable manner by the valiant and handsome Sir\r\nPeter Parker, upon whose death, on a national arson expedition on the\r\nshores of Chesapeake Bay, in 1812 or 1813, Lord Byron wrote his\r\nwell-known stanzas. “By the god of war!” said Sir Peter to his sailors,\r\n“I’ll make you touch your hat to a midshipman’s coat, if it’s only hung\r\non a broomstick to dry!”\r\n\r\nThat the king, in the eye of the law, can do no wrong, is the\r\nwell-known fiction of despotic states; but it has remained for the\r\nnavies of Constitutional Monarchies and Republics to magnify this\r\nfiction, by indirectly extending it to all the quarter-deck\r\nsubordinates of an armed ship’s chief magistrate. And though judicially\r\nunrecognised, and unacknowledged by the officers themselves, yet this\r\nis the principle that pervades the fleet; this is the principle that is\r\nevery hour acted upon, and to sustain which, thousands of seamen have\r\nbeen flogged at the gangway.\r\n\r\nHowever childish, ignorant, stupid, or idiotic a midshipman, if he but\r\norders a sailor to perform even the most absurd action, that man is not\r\nonly bound to render instant and unanswering obedience, but he would\r\nrefuse at his peril. And if, having obeyed, he should then complain to\r\nthe Captain, and the Captain, in his own mind, should be thoroughly\r\nconvinced of the impropriety, perhaps of the illegality of the order,\r\nyet, in nine cases out of ten, he would not publicly reprimand the\r\nmidshipman, nor by the slightest token admit before the complainant\r\nthat, in this particular thing, the midshipman had done otherwise than\r\nperfectly right.\r\n\r\nUpon a midshipman’s complaining of a seaman to Lord Collingwood, when\r\nCaptain of a line-of-battle ship, he ordered the man for punishment;\r\nand, in the interval, calling the midshipman aside, said to him, “In\r\nall probability, now, the fault is yours—you know; therefore, when the\r\nman is brought to the mast, you had better ask for his pardon.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, upon the lad’s public intercession, Collingwood, turning\r\nto the culprit, said, “This young gentleman has pleaded so humanely for\r\nyou, that, in hope you feel a due gratitude to him for his benevolence,\r\nI will, for this time, overlook your offence.” This story is related by\r\nthe editor of the Admiral’s “Correspondence,” to show the Admiral’s\r\nkindheartedness.\r\n\r\nNow Collingood was, in reality, one of the most just, humane, and\r\nbenevolent admirals that ever hoisted a flag. For a sea-officer,\r\nCollingwood was a man in a million. But if a man like him, swayed by\r\nold usages, could thus violate the commonest principle of justice—with\r\nhowever good motives at bottom—what must be expected from other\r\nCaptains not so eminently gifted with noble traits as Collingwood?\r\n\r\nAnd if the corps of American midshipmen is mostly replenished from the\r\nnursery, the counter, and the lap of unrestrained indulgence at home:\r\nand if most of them at least, by their impotency as officers, in all\r\nimportant functions at sea, by their boyish and overweening conceit of\r\ntheir gold lace, by their overbearing manner toward the seamen, and by\r\ntheir peculiar aptitude to construe the merest trivialities of manner\r\ninto set affronts against their dignity; if by all this they sometimes\r\ncontract the ill-will of the seamen; and if, in a thousand ways, the\r\nseamen cannot but betray it—how easy for any of these midshipmen, who\r\nmay happen to be unrestrained by moral principle, to resort to spiteful\r\npractices in procuring vengeance upon the offenders, in many instances\r\nto the extremity of the lash; since, as we have seen, the tacit\r\nprinciple in the Navy seems to be that, in his ordinary intercourse\r\nwith the sailors, a midshipman can do nothing obnoxious to the public\r\ncensure of his superiors.\r\n\r\n“You fellow, I’ll get you _licked_ before long,” is often heard from a\r\nmidshipman to a sailor who, in some way not open to the judicial action\r\nof the Captain, has chanced to offend him.\r\n\r\nAt times you will see one of these lads, not five feet high, gazing up\r\nwith inflamed eye at some venerable six-footer of a forecastle man,\r\ncursing and insulting him by every epithet deemed most scandalous and\r\nunendurable among men. Yet that man’s indignant tongue is\r\ntreble-knotted by the law, that suspends death itself over his head\r\nshould his passion discharge the slightest blow at the boy-worm that\r\nspits at his feet.\r\n\r\nBut since what human nature is, and what it must for ever continue to\r\nbe, is well enough understood for most practical purposes, it needs no\r\nspecial example to prove that, where the merest boys, indiscriminately\r\nsnatched from the human family, are given such authority over mature\r\nmen, the results must be proportionable in monstrousness to the custom\r\nthat authorises this worse than cruel absurdity.\r\n\r\nNor is it unworthy of remark that, while the noblest-minded and most\r\nheroic sea-officers—men of the topmost stature, including Lord Nelson\r\nhimself—have regarded flogging in the Navy with the deepest concern,\r\nand not without weighty scruples touching its general necessity, still,\r\none who has seen much of midshipmen can truly say that he has seen but\r\nfew midshipmen who were not enthusiastic advocates and admirers of\r\nscourging. It would almost seem that they themselves, having so\r\nrecently escaped the posterior discipline of the nursery and the infant\r\nschool, are impatient to recover from those smarting reminiscences by\r\nmincing the backs of full-grown American freemen.\r\n\r\nIt should not to be omitted here, that the midshipmen in the English\r\nNavy are not permitted to be quite so imperious as in the American\r\nships. They are divided into three (I think) probationary classes of\r\n“volunteers,” instead of being at once advanced to a warrant. Nor will\r\nyou fail to remark, when you see an English cutter officered by one of\r\nthose volunteers, that the boy does not so strut and slap his dirk-hilt\r\nwith a Bobadil air, and anticipatingly feel of the place where his\r\nwarlike whiskers are going to be, and sputter out oaths so at the men,\r\nas is too often the case with the little boys wearing best-bower\r\nanchors on their lapels in the American Navy.\r\n\r\nYet it must be confessed that at times you see midshipmen who are noble\r\nlittle fellows, and not at all disliked by the crew. Besides three\r\ngallant youths, one black-eyed little lad in particular, in the\r\nNeversink, was such a one. From his diminutiveness, he went by the name\r\nof _Boat Plug_ among the seamen. Without being exactly familiar with\r\nthem, he had yet become a general favourite, by reason of his kindness\r\nof manner, and never cursing them. It was amusing to hear some of the\r\nolder Tritons invoke blessings upon the youngster, when his kind tones\r\nfell on their weather-beaten ears. “Ah, good luck to you, sir!”\r\ntouching their hats to the little man; “you have a soul to be saved,\r\nsir!” There was a wonderful deal of meaning involved in the latter\r\nsentence. _You have a soul to be saved_, is the phrase which a\r\nman-of-war’s-man peculiarly applies to a humane and kind-hearted\r\nofficer. It also implies that the majority of quarter-deck officers are\r\nregarded by them in such a light that they deny to them the possession\r\nof souls. Ah! but these plebeians sometimes have a sublime vengeance\r\nupon patricians. Imagine an outcast old sailor seriously cherishing the\r\npurely speculative conceit that some bully in epaulets, who orders him\r\nto and fro like a slave, is of an organization immeasurably inferior to\r\nhimself; must at last perish with the brutes, while he goes to his\r\nimmortality in heaven.\r\n\r\nBut from what has been said in this chapter, it must not be inferred\r\nthat a midshipman leads a lord’s life in a man-of-war. Far from it. He\r\nlords it over those below him, while lorded over himself by his\r\nsuperiors. It is as if with one hand a school-boy snapped his fingers\r\nat a dog, and at the same time received upon the other the discipline\r\nof the usher’s ferule. And though, by the American Articles of War, a\r\nNavy Captain cannot, of his own authority, legally punish a midshipman,\r\notherwise than by suspension from duty (the same as with respect to the\r\nWard-room officers), yet this is one of those sea-statutes which the\r\nCaptain, to a certain extent, observes or disregards at his pleasure.\r\nMany instances might be related of the petty mortifications and\r\nofficial insults inflicted by some Captains upon their midshipmen; far\r\nmore severe, in one sense, than the old-fashioned punishment of sending\r\nthem to the mast-head, though not so arbitrary as sending them before\r\nthe mast, to do duty with the common sailors—a custom, in former times,\r\npursued by Captains in the English Navy.\r\n\r\nCaptain Claret himself had no special fondness for midshipmen. A tall,\r\novergrown young midshipman, about sixteen years old, having fallen\r\nunder his displeasure, he interrupted the humble apologies he was\r\nmaking, by saying, “Not a word, sir! I’ll not hear a word! Mount the\r\nnetting, sir, and stand there till you are ordered to come down!”\r\n\r\nThe midshipman obeyed; and, in full sight of the entire ship’s company,\r\nCaptain Claret promenaded to and fro below his lofty perch, reading him\r\na most aggravating lecture upon his alleged misconduct. To a lad of\r\nsensibility, such treatment must have been almost as stinging as the\r\nlash itself would have been.\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that, wherever these chapters treat of\r\nmidshipmen, the officers known as passed-midshipmen are not at all\r\nreferred to. In the American Navy, these officers form a class of young\r\nmen, who, having seen sufficient service at sea as midshipmen to pass\r\nan examination before a Board of Commodores, are promoted to the rank\r\nof passed-midshipmen, introductory to that of lieutenant. They are\r\nsupposed to be qualified to do duty as lieutenants, and in some cases\r\ntemporarily serve as such. The difference between a passed-midshipman\r\nand a midshipman may be also inferred from their respective rates of\r\npay. The former, upon sea-service, receives $750 a year; the latter,\r\n$400. There were no passed-midshipmen in the Neversink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\nSEAFARING PERSONS PECULIARLY SUBJECT TO BEING UNDER THE WEATHER.—THE\r\nEFFECTS OF THIS UPON A MAN-OF-WAR CAPTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that some midshipmen, in certain cases, are guilty of\r\nspiteful practices against the man-of-war’s-man. But as these\r\nmidshipmen are presumed to have received the liberal and lofty breeding\r\nof gentlemen, it would seem all but incredible that any of their corps\r\ncould descend to the paltriness of cherishing personal malice against\r\nso conventionally degraded a being as a sailor. So, indeed, it would\r\nseem. But when all the circumstances are considered, it will not appear\r\nextraordinary that some of them should thus cast discredit upon the\r\nwarrants they wear. Title, and rank, and wealth, and education cannot\r\nunmake human nature; the same in cabin-boy and commodore, its only\r\ndifferences lie in the different modes of development.\r\n\r\nAt sea, a frigate houses and homes five hundred mortals in a space so\r\ncontracted that they can hardly so much as move but they touch. Cut off\r\nfrom all those outward passing things which ashore employ the eyes,\r\ntongues, and thoughts of landsmen, the inmates of a frigate are thrown\r\nupon themselves and each other, and all their ponderings are\r\nintrospective. A morbidness of mind is often the consequence,\r\nespecially upon long voyages, accompanied by foul weather, calms, or\r\nhead-winds. Nor does this exempt from its evil influence any rank on\r\nboard. Indeed, high station only ministers to it the more, since the\r\nhigher the rank in a man-of-war, the less companionship.\r\n\r\nIt is an odious, unthankful, repugnant thing to dwell upon a subject\r\nlike this; nevertheless, be it said, that, through these jaundiced\r\ninfluences, even the captain of a frigate is, in some cases, indirectly\r\ninduced to the infliction of corporal punishment upon a seaman. Never\r\nsail under a navy captain whom you suspect of being dyspeptic, or\r\nconstitutionally prone to hypochondria.\r\n\r\nThe manifestation of these things is sometimes remarkable. In the\r\nearlier part of the cruise, while making a long, tedious run from\r\nMazatlan to Callao on the Main, baffled by light head winds and\r\nfrequent intermitting calms, when all hands were heartily wearied by\r\nthe torrid, monotonous sea, a good-natured fore-top-man, by the name of\r\nCandy—quite a character in his way—standing in the waist among a crowd\r\nof seamen, touched me, and said, “D’ye see the old man there,\r\nWhite-Jacket, walking the poop? Well, don’t he look as if he wanted to\r\nflog someone? Look at him once.”\r\n\r\nBut to me, at least, no such indications were visible in the deportment\r\nof the Captain, though his thrashing the arm-chest with the slack of\r\nthe spanker-out-haul looked a little suspicious. But any one might have\r\nbeen doing that to pass away a calm.\r\n\r\n“Depend on it,” said the top-man, “he must somehow have thought I was\r\nmaking sport of _him_ a while ago, when I was only taking off old\r\nPriming, the gunner’s mate. Just look at him once, White-Jacket, while\r\nI make believe coil this here rope; if there arn’t a dozen in that ’ere\r\nCaptain’s top-lights, my name is _horse-marine_. If I could only touch\r\nmy tile to him now, and take my Bible oath on it, that I was only\r\ntaking off Priming, and not _him_, he wouldn’t have such hard thoughts\r\nof me. But that can’t be done; he’d think I meant to insult him. Well,\r\nit can’t be helped; I suppose I must look out for a baker’s dozen afore\r\nlong.”\r\n\r\nI had an incredulous laugh at this. But two days afterward, when we\r\nwere hoisting the main-top-mast stun’-sail, and the Lieutenant of the\r\nWatch was reprimanding the crowd of seamen at the halyards for their\r\nlaziness—for the sail was but just crawling up to its place, owing to\r\nthe languor of the men, induced by the heat—the Captain, who had been\r\nimpatiently walking the deck, suddenly stopped short, and darting his\r\neyes among the seamen, suddenly fixed them, crying out, “You, Candy,\r\nand be damned to you, you don’t pull an ounce, you blackguard! Stand up\r\nto that gun, sir; I’ll teach you to be grinning over a rope that way,\r\nwithout lending your pound of beef to it. Boatswain’s mate, where’s\r\nyour _colt?_ Give that man a dozen.”\r\n\r\nRemoving his hat, the boatswain’s mate looked into the crown aghast;\r\nthe coiled rope, usually worn there, was not to be found; but the next\r\ninstant it slid from the top of his head to the deck. Picking it up,\r\nand straightening it out, he advanced toward the sailor.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said Candy, touching and retouching his cap to the Captain, “I\r\nwas pulling, sir, as much as the rest, sir; I was, indeed, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Stand up to that gun,” cried the Captain. “Boatswain’s mate, do your\r\nduty.”\r\n\r\nThree stripes were given, when the Captain raised his finger.\r\n“You——,[3] do you dare stand up to be flogged with your hat on! Take it\r\noff, sir, instantly.”\r\n\r\n [3] The phrase here used I have never seen either written or printed,\r\n and should not like to be the first person to introduce it to the\r\n public.\r\n\r\n\r\nCandy dropped it on deck.\r\n\r\n“Now go on, boatswain’s mate.” And the sailor received his dozen.\r\n\r\nWith his hand to his back he came up to me, where I stood among the\r\nby-standers, saying, “O Lord, O Lord! that boatswain’s mate, too, had a\r\nspite agin me; he always thought it was _me_ that set afloat that yarn\r\nabout his wife in Norfolk. O Lord! just run your hand under my shirt\r\nwill you, White-Jacket? There!! didn’t he have a spite agin me, to\r\nraise such bars as them? And my shirt all cut to pieces, too—arn’t it,\r\nWhite-Jacket? Damn me, but these coltings puts the tin in the Purser’s\r\npocket. O Lord! my back feels as if there was a red-hot gridiron lashed\r\nto it. But I told you so—a widow’s curse on him, say I—he thought I\r\nmeant _him_, and not Priming.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n“THE PEOPLE” ARE GIVEN “LIBERTY.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever, in intervals of mild benevolence, or yielding to mere politic\r\ndictates, Kings and Commodores relax the yoke of servitude, they should\r\nsee to it well that the concession seem not too sudden or unqualified;\r\nfor, in the commoner’s estimation, that might argue feebleness or fear.\r\n\r\nHence it was, perhaps, that, though noble Jack had carried the day\r\ncaptive in his audience at the mast, yet more than thirty-six hours\r\nelapsed ere anything official was heard of the “liberty” his shipmates\r\nso earnestly coveted. Some of the people began to growl and grumble.\r\n\r\n“It’s turned out all gammon, Jack,” said one.\r\n\r\n“Blast the Commodore!” cried another, “he bamboozled you, Jack.”\r\n\r\n“Lay on your oars a while,” answered Jack, “and we shall see; we’ve\r\nstruck for liberty, and liberty we’ll have! I’m your tribune, boys; I’m\r\nyour Rienzi. The Commodore must keep his word.”\r\n\r\nNext day, about breakfast-time, a mighty whistling and piping was heard\r\nat the main-hatchway, and presently the boatswain’s voice was heard:\r\n“D’ye hear there, fore and aft! all you starboard-quarter watch! get\r\nready to go ashore on liberty!”\r\n\r\nIn a paroxysm of delight, a young mizzen-top-man, standing by at the\r\ntime, whipped the tarpaulin from his head, and smashed it like a\r\npancake on the deck. “Liberty!” he shouted, leaping down into the\r\nberth-deck after his bag.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour, the quarter-watch mustered round the capstan, at\r\nwhich stood our old First Lord of the Treasury and Pay-Master-General,\r\nthe Purser, with several goodly buck-skin bags of dollars, piled up on\r\nthe capstan. He helped us all round to half a handful or so, and then\r\nthe boats were manned, and, like so many Esterhazys, we were pulled\r\nashore by our shipmates. All their lives lords may live in listless\r\nstate; but give the commoners a holiday, and they outlord the Commodore\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe ship’s company were divided into four sections or quarter-watches,\r\nonly one of which were on shore at a time, the rest remaining to\r\ngarrison the frigate—the term of liberty for each being twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nWith Jack Chase and a few other discreet and gentlemanly top-men, I\r\nwent ashore on the first day, with the first quarter-watch. Our own\r\nlittle party had a charming time; we saw many fine sights; fell in—as\r\nall sailors must—with dashing adventures. But, though not a few good\r\nchapters might be written on this head, I must again forbear; for in\r\nthis book I have nothing to do with the shore further than to glance at\r\nit, now and then, from the water; my man-of-war world alone must supply\r\nme with the staple of my matter; I have taken an oath to keep afloat to\r\nthe last letter of my narrative.\r\n\r\nHad they all been as punctual as Jack Chase’s party, the whole\r\nquarter-watch of liberty-men had been safe on board the frigate at the\r\nexpiration of the twenty-four hours. But this was not the case; and\r\nduring the entire day succeeding, the midshipmen and others were\r\nengaged in ferreting them out of their hiding-places on shore, and\r\nbringing them off in scattered detachments to the ship.\r\n\r\nThey came in all imaginable stages of intoxication; some with blackened\r\neyes and broken heads; some still more severely injured, having been\r\nstabbed in frays with the Portuguese soldiers. Others, unharmed, were\r\nimmediately dropped on the gun-deck, between the guns, where they lay\r\nsnoring for the rest of the day. As a considerable degree of license is\r\ninvariably permitted to man-of-war’s-men just “off liberty,” and as\r\nman-of-war’s-men well know this to be the case, they occasionally avail\r\nthemselves of the privilege to talk very frankly to the officers when\r\nthey first cross the gangway, taking care, meanwhile, to reel about\r\nvery industriously, so that there shall be no doubt about their being\r\nseriously intoxicated, and altogether _non compos_ for the time. And\r\nthough but few of them have cause to feign intoxication, yet some\r\nindividuals may be suspected of enacting a studied part upon these\r\noccasions. Indeed—judging by certain symptoms—even when really\r\ninebriated, some of the sailors must have previously determined upon\r\ntheir conduct; just as some persons who, before taking the exhilarating\r\ngas, secretly make up their minds to perform certain mad feats while\r\nunder its influence, which feats consequently come to pass precisely as\r\nif the actors were not accountable for them.\r\n\r\nFor several days, while the other quarter-watches were given liberty,\r\nthe Neversink presented a sad scene. She was more like a madhouse than\r\na frigate; the gun-deck resounded with frantic fights, shouts, and\r\nsongs. All visitors from shore were kept at a cable’s length.\r\n\r\nThese scenes, however, are nothing to those which have repeatedly been\r\nenacted in American men-of-war upon other stations. But the custom of\r\nintroducing women on board, in harbour, is now pretty much\r\ndiscontinued, both in the English and American Navy, unless a ship,\r\ncommanded by some dissolute Captain, happens to lie in some far away,\r\noutlandish port, in the Pacific or Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe British line-of-battle ship, Royal George, which in 1782 sunk at\r\nher anchors at Spithead, carried down three hundred English women among\r\nthe one thousand souls that were drowned on that memorable morning.\r\n\r\nWhen, at last, after all the mad tumult and contention of “Liberty,”\r\nthe reaction came, our frigate presented a very different scene. The\r\nmen looked jaded and wan, lethargic and lazy; and many an old mariner,\r\nwith hand upon abdomen, called upon the Flag-staff to witness that\r\nthere were more _hot coppers_ in the Neversink than those in the ship’s\r\ngalley.\r\n\r\nSuch are the lamentable effects of suddenly and completely releasing\r\n“_the people_” of a man-of-war from arbitrary discipline. It shows\r\nthat, to such, “liberty,” at first, must be administered in small and\r\nmoderate quantities, increasing with the patient’s capacity to make\r\ngood use of it.\r\n\r\nOf course while we lay in Rio, our officers frequently went ashore for\r\npleasure, and, as a general thing, conducted themselves with propriety.\r\nBut it is a sad thing to say, that, as for Lieutenant Mad Jack, he\r\nenjoyed himself so delightfully for three consecutive days in the town,\r\nthat, upon returning to the ship, he sent his card to the Surgeon, with\r\nhis compliments, begging him to drop into his state-room the first time\r\nhe happened to pass that way in the ward-room.\r\n\r\nBut one of our Surgeon’s mates, a young medico of fine family but\r\nslender fortune, must have created by far the strongest impression\r\namong the hidalgoes of Rio. He had read Don Quixote, and, instead of\r\ncuring him of his Quixotism, as it ought to have done, it only made him\r\nstill more Quixotic. Indeed, there are some natures concerning whose\r\nmoral maladies the grand maxim of Mr. Similia Similibus Curantur\r\nHahneman does not hold true, since, with them, _like cures_ not _like_,\r\nbut only aggravates _like_. Though, on the other hand, so incurable are\r\nthe moral maladies of such persons, that the antagonist maxim,\r\n_contraria contrariis curantar_, often proves equally false.\r\n\r\nOf a warm tropical day, this Surgeon’s mate must needs go ashore in his\r\nblue cloth boat-cloak, wearing it, with a gallant Spanish toss, over\r\nhis cavalier shoulder. By noon, he perspired very freely; but then his\r\ncloak attracted all eyes, and that was huge satisfaction. Nevertheless,\r\nhis being knock-kneed, and spavined of one leg, sorely impaired the\r\neffect of this hidalgo cloak, which, by-the-way, was some-what rusty in\r\nfront, where his chin rubbed against it, and a good deal bedraggled all\r\nover, from his having used it as a counterpane off Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nAs for the midshipmen, there is no knowing what their mammas would have\r\nsaid to their conduct in Rio. Three of them drank a good deal too much;\r\nand when they came on board, the Captain ordered them to be sewed up in\r\ntheir hammocks, to cut short their obstreperous capers till sober.\r\n\r\nThis shows how unwise it is to allow children yet in their teens to\r\nwander so far from home. It more especially illustrates the folly of\r\ngiving them long holidays in a foreign land, full of seductive\r\ndissipation. Port for men, claret for boys, cried Dr. Johnson. Even so,\r\nmen only should drink the strong drink of travel; boys should still be\r\nkept on milk and water at home. Middies! you may despise your mother’s\r\nleading-strings, but they are the _man-ropes_ my lads, by which many\r\nyoungsters have steadied the giddiness of youth, and saved themselves\r\nfrom lamentable falls. And middies! know this, that as infants, being\r\ntoo early put on their feet, grow up bandy-legged, and curtailed of\r\ntheir fair proportions, even so, my dear middies, does it morally prove\r\nwith some of you, who prematurely are sent off to sea.\r\n\r\nThese admonitions are solely addressed to the more diminutive class of\r\nmidshipmen—those under five feet high, and under seven stone in weight.\r\n\r\nTruly, the records of the steerages of men-of-war are full of most\r\nmelancholy examples of early dissipation, disease, disgrace, and death.\r\nAnswer, ye shades of fine boys, who in the soils of all climes, the\r\nround world over, far away sleep from your homes.\r\n\r\nMothers of men! If your hearts have been cast down when your boys have\r\nfallen in the way of temptations ashore, how much more bursting your\r\ngrief, did you know that those boys were far from your arms, cabined\r\nand cribbed in by all manner of iniquities. But this some of you cannot\r\nbelieve. It is, perhaps, well that it is so.\r\n\r\nBut hold them fast—all those who have not yet weighed their anchors for\r\nthe Navy-round and round, hitch over hitch, bind your leading-strings\r\non them, and clinching a ring-bolt into your chimmey-jam, moor your\r\nboys fast to that best of harbours, the hearth-stone.\r\n\r\nBut if youth be giddy, old age is staid; even as young saplings, in the\r\nlitheness of their limbs, toss to their roots in the fresh morning air;\r\nbut, stiff and unyielding with age, mossy trunks never bend. With pride\r\nand pleasure be it said, that, as for our old Commodore, though he\r\nmight treat himself to as many “_liberty days_” as he pleased, yet\r\nthroughout our stay in Rio he conducted himself with the utmost\r\ndiscretion.\r\n\r\nBut he was an old, old man; physically, a very small man; his spine was\r\nas an unloaded musket-barrel—not only attenuated, but destitute of a\r\nsolitary cartridge, and his ribs were as the ribs of a weasel.\r\n\r\nBesides, he was Commodore of the fleet, supreme lord of the Commons in\r\nBlue. It beseemed him, therefore, to erect himself into an ensample of\r\nvirtue, and show the gun-deck what virtue was. But alas! when Virtue\r\nsits high aloft on a frigate’s poop, when Virtue is crowned in the\r\ncabin a Commodore, when Virtue rules by compulsion, and domineers over\r\nVice as a slave, then Virtue, though her mandates be outwardly\r\nobserved, bears little interior sway. To be efficacious, Virtue must\r\ncome down from aloft, even as our blessed Redeemer came down to redeem\r\nour whole man-of-war world; to that end, mixing with its sailors and\r\nsinners as equals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\nMIDSHIPMEN ENTERING THE NAVY EARLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe allusion in the preceding chapter to the early age at which some of\r\nthe midshipmen enter the Navy, suggests some thoughts relative to more\r\nimportant considerations.\r\n\r\nA very general modern impression seems to be, that, in order to learn\r\nthe profession of a sea-officer, a boy can hardly be sent to sea too\r\nearly. To a certain extent, this may be a mistake. Other professions,\r\ninvolving a knowledge of technicalities and things restricted to one\r\nparticular field of action, are frequently mastered by men who begin\r\nafter the age of twenty-one, or even at a later period of life. It was\r\nonly about the middle of the seventeenth century that the British\r\nmilitary and naval services were kept distinct. Previous to that epoch\r\nthe king’s officers commanded indifferently either by sea or by land.\r\n\r\nRobert Blake, perhaps one of the most accomplished, and certainly one\r\nof the most successful Admirals that ever hoisted a flag, was more than\r\nhalf a century old (fifty-one years) before he entered the naval\r\nservice, or had aught to do, professionally, with a ship. He was of a\r\nstudious turn, and, after leaving Oxford, resided quietly on his\r\nestate, a country gentleman, till his forty-second year, soon after\r\nwhich he became connected with the Parliamentary army.\r\n\r\nThe historian Clarendon says of him, “He was the first man that made it\r\nmanifest that the science (seamanship) might be attained in less time\r\nthan was imagined.” And doubtless it was to his shore sympathies that\r\nthe well-known humanity and kindness which Blake evinced in his\r\nintercourse with the sailors is in a large degree to be imputed.\r\n\r\nMidshipmen sent into the Navy at a very early age are exposed to the\r\npassive reception of all the prejudices of the quarter-deck in favour\r\nof ancient usages, however useless or pernicious; those prejudices grow\r\nup with them, and solidify with their very bones. As they rise in rank,\r\nthey naturally carry them up, whence the inveterate repugnance of many\r\nCommodores and Captains to the slightest innovations in the service,\r\nhowever salutary they may appear to landsmen.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be doubted that, in matters connected with the general\r\nwelfare of the Navy, government has paid rather too much deference to\r\nthe opinions of the officers of the Navy, considering them as men\r\nalmost born to the service, and therefore far better qualified to judge\r\nconcerning any and all questions touching it than people on shore. But\r\nin a nation under a liberal Constitution, it must ever be unwise to\r\nmake too distinct and peculiar the profession of either branch of its\r\nmilitary men. True, in a country like ours, nothing is at present to be\r\napprehended of their gaining political rule; but not a little is to be\r\napprehended concerning their perpetuating or creating abuses among\r\ntheir subordinates, unless civilians have full cognisance of their\r\nadministrative affairs, and account themselves competent to the\r\ncomplete overlooking and ordering them.\r\n\r\nWe do wrong when we in any way contribute to the prevailing\r\nmystification that has been thrown about the internal affairs of the\r\nnational sea-service. Hitherto those affairs have been regarded even by\r\nsome high state functionaries as things beyond their insight—altogether\r\ntoo technical and mysterious to be fully comprehended by landsmen. And\r\nthis it is that has perpetuated in the Navy many evils that otherwise\r\nwould have been abolished in the general amelioration of other things.\r\nThe army is sometimes remodelled, but the Navy goes down from\r\ngeneration to generation almost untouched and unquestioned, as if its\r\ncode were infallible, and itself a piece of perfection that no\r\nstatesman could improve. When a Secretary of the Navy ventures to\r\ninnovate upon its established customs, you hear some of the Navy\r\nofficers say, “What does this landsman know about our affairs? Did he\r\never head a watch? He does not know starboard from larboard, girt-line\r\nfrom back-stay.”\r\n\r\nWhile we deferentially and cheerfully leave to Navy officers the sole\r\nconduct of making and shortening sail, tacking ship, and performing\r\nother nautical manoeuvres, as may seem to them best; let us beware of\r\nabandoning to their discretion those general municipal regulations\r\ntouching the well-being of the great body of men before the mast; let\r\nus beware of being too much influenced by their opinions in matters\r\nwhere it is but natural to suppose that their long-established\r\nprejudices are enlisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\nA SHORE EMPEROR ON BOARD A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we lay in Rio, we sometimes had company from shore; but an\r\nunforeseen honour awaited us. One day, the young Emperor, Don Pedro\r\nII., and suite—making a circuit of the harbour, and visiting all the\r\nmen-of-war in rotation—at last condescendingly visited the Neversink.\r\n\r\nHe came in a splendid barge, rowed by thirty African slaves, who, after\r\nthe Brazilian manner, in concert rose upright to their oars at every\r\nstroke; then sank backward again to their seats with a simultaneous\r\ngroan.\r\n\r\nHe reclined under a canopy of yellow silk, looped with tassels of\r\ngreen, the national colours. At the stern waved the Brazilian flag,\r\nbearing a large diamond figure in the centre, emblematical, perhaps, of\r\nthe mines of precious stones in the interior; or, it may be, a\r\nmagnified portrait of the famous “Portuguese diamond” itself, which was\r\nfound in Brazil, in the district of Tejuco, on the banks of the Rio\r\nBelmonte.\r\n\r\nWe gave them a grand salute, which almost made the ship’s live-oak\r\n_knees_ knock together with the tremendous concussions. We manned the\r\nyards, and went through a long ceremonial of paying the Emperor homage.\r\nRepublicans are often more courteous to royalty than royalists\r\nthemselves. But doubtless this springs from a noble magnanimity.\r\n\r\nAt the gangway, the Emperor was received by our Commodore in person,\r\narrayed in his most resplendent coat and finest French epaulets. His\r\nservant had devoted himself to polishing every button that morning with\r\nrotten-stone and rags—your sea air is a sworn foe to metallic glosses;\r\nwhence it comes that the swords of sea-officers have, of late, so\r\nrusted in their scabbards that they are with difficulty drawn.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine sight to see this Emperor and Commodore complimenting\r\neach other. Both were _chapeaux-de-bras_, and both continually waved\r\nthem. By instinct, the Emperor knew that the venerable personage before\r\nhim was as much a monarch afloat as he himself was ashore. Did not our\r\nCommodore carry the sword of state by his side? For though not borne\r\nbefore him, it must have been a sword of state, since it looked far to\r\nlustrous to have been his fighting sword. _That_ was naught but a\r\nlimber steel blade, with a plain, serviceable handle, like the handle\r\nof a slaughter-house knife.\r\n\r\nWho ever saw a star when the noon sun was in sight? But you seldom see\r\na king without satellites. In the suite of the youthful Emperor came a\r\nprincely train; so brilliant with gems, that they seemed just emerged\r\nfrom the mines of the Rio Belmonte.\r\n\r\nYou have seen cones of crystallised salt? Just so flashed these\r\nPortuguese Barons, Marquises, Viscounts, and Counts. Were it not for\r\ntheir titles, and being seen in the train of their lord, you would have\r\nsworn they were eldest sons of jewelers all, who had run away with\r\ntheir fathers’ cases on their backs.\r\n\r\nContrasted with these lamp-lustres of Barons of Brazil, how waned the\r\ngold lace of our barons of the frigate, the officers of the gun-room!\r\nand compared with the long, jewel-hilted rapiers of the Marquises, the\r\nlittle dirks of our cadets of noble houses—the middies—looked like\r\ngilded tenpenny nails in their girdles.\r\n\r\nBut there they stood! Commodore and Emperor, Lieutenants and Marquises,\r\nmiddies and pages! The brazen band on the poop struck up; the marine\r\nguard presented arms; and high aloft, looking down on this scene, all\r\n_the people_ vigorously hurraed. A top-man next me on the\r\nmain-royal-yard removed his hat, and diligently manipulated his head in\r\nhonour of the event; but he was so far out of sight in the clouds, that\r\nthis ceremony went for nothing.\r\n\r\nA great pity it was, that in addition to all these honours, that\r\nadmirer of Portuguese literature, Viscount Strangford, of Great\r\nBritain—who, I believe, once went out Ambassador Extraordinary to the\r\nBrazils—it was a pity that he was not present on this occasion, to\r\nyield his tribute of “A Stanza to Braganza!” For our royal visitor was\r\nan undoubted Braganza, allied to nearly all the great families of\r\nEurope. His grandfather, John VI., had been King of Portugal; his own\r\nsister, Maria, was now its queen. He was, indeed, a distinguished young\r\ngentleman, entitled to high consideration, and that consideration was\r\nmost cheerfully accorded him.\r\n\r\nHe wore a green dress-coat, with one regal morning-star at the breast,\r\nand white pantaloons. In his chapeau was a single, bright, golden-hued\r\nfeather of the Imperial Toucan fowl, a magnificent, omnivorous,\r\nbroad-billed bandit bird of prey, a native of Brazil. Its perch is on\r\nthe loftiest trees, whence it looks down upon all humbler fowls, and,\r\nhawk-like, flies at their throats. The Toucan once formed part of the\r\nsavage regalia of the Indian caciques of the country, and upon the\r\nestablishment of the empire, was symbolically retained by the\r\nPortuguese sovereigns.\r\n\r\nHis Imperial Majesty was yet in his youth; rather corpulent, if\r\nanything, with a care-free, pleasant face, and a polite, indifferent,\r\nand easy address. His manners, indeed, were entirely unexceptionable.\r\n\r\nNow here, thought I, is a very fine lad, with very fine prospects\r\nbefore him. He is supreme Emperor of all these Brazils; he has no\r\nstormy night-watches to stand; he can lay abed of mornings just as long\r\nas he pleases. Any gentleman in Rio would be proud of his personal\r\nacquaintance, and the prettiest girl in all South America would deem\r\nherself honoured with the least glance from the acutest angle of his\r\neye.\r\n\r\nYes: this young Emperor will have a fine time of this life, even so\r\nlong as he condescends to exist. Every one jumps to obey him; and see,\r\nas I live, there is an old nobleman in his suit—the Marquis d’Acarty\r\nthey call him, old enough to be his grandfather—who, in the hot sun, is\r\nstanding bareheaded before him, while the Emperor carries his hat on\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n“I suppose that old gentleman, now,” said a young New England tar\r\nbeside me, “would consider it a great honour to put on his Royal\r\nMajesty’s boots; and yet, White-Jacket, if yonder Emperor and I were to\r\nstrip and jump overboard for a bath, it would be hard telling which was\r\nof the blood royal when we should once be in the water. Look you, Don\r\nPedro II.,” he added, “how do you come to be Emperor? Tell me that. You\r\ncannot pull as many pounds as I on the main-topsail-halyards; you are\r\nnot as tall as I: your nose is a pug, and mine is a cut-water; and how\r\ndo you come to be a ‘_brigand_,’ with that thin pair of spars? A\r\n_brigand_, indeed!”\r\n\r\n“_Braganza_, you mean,” said I, willing to correct the rhetoric of so\r\nfierce a republican, and, by so doing, chastise his censoriousness.\r\n\r\n“Braganza! _bragger_ it is,” he replied; “and a bragger, indeed. See\r\nthat feather in his cap! See how he struts in that coat! He may well\r\nwear a green one, top-mates—he’s a green-looking swab at the best.”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Jonathan,” said I; “there’s the _First Duff_ looking up. Be\r\nstill! the Emperor will hear you;” and I put my hand on his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Take your hand away, White-Jacket,” he cried; “there’s no law up aloft\r\nhere. I say, you Emperor—you greenhorn in the green coat, there—look\r\nyou, you can’t raise a pair of whiskers yet; and see what a pair of\r\nhomeward-bounders I have on my jowls! _Don Pedro_, eh? What’s that,\r\nafter all, but plain Peter—reckoned a shabby name in my country. Damn\r\nme, White-Jacket, I wouldn’t call my dog Peter!”\r\n\r\n“Clap a stopper on your jaw-tackle, will you?” cried Ringbolt, the\r\nsailor on the other side of him. “You’ll be getting us all into darbies\r\nfor this.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t trice up my red rag for nobody,” retorted Jonathan. “So you\r\nhad better take a round turn with yours, Ringbolt, and let me alone, or\r\nI’ll fetch you such a swat over your figure-head, you’ll think a Long\r\nWharf truck-horse kicked you with all four shoes on one hoof! You\r\nEmperor—you counter-jumping son of a gun—cock your weather eye up aloft\r\nhere, and see your betters! I say, top-mates, he ain’t any Emperor at\r\nall—I’m the rightful Emperor. Yes, by the Commodore’s boots! they stole\r\nme out of my cradle here in the palace of Rio, and put that green-horn\r\nin my place. Ay, you timber-head, you, I’m Don Pedro II., and by good\r\nrights you ought to be a main-top-man here, with your fist in a\r\ntar-bucket! Look you, I say, that crown of yours ought to be on my\r\nhead; or, if you don’t believe _that_, just heave it into the ring\r\nonce, and see who’s the best man.”\r\n\r\n“What’s this hurra’s nest here aloft?” cried Jack Chase, coming up the\r\nt’-gallant rigging from the top-sail yard. “Can’t you behave yourself,\r\nroyal-yard-men, when an Emperor’s on board?”\r\n\r\n“It’s this here Jonathan,” answered Ringbolt; “he’s been blackguarding\r\nthe young nob in the green coat, there. He says Don Pedro stole his\r\nhat.”\r\n\r\n“How?”\r\n\r\n“Crown, he means, noble Jack,” said a top-man.\r\n\r\n“Jonathan don’t call himself an Emperor, does he?” asked Jack.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” cried Jonathan; “that greenhorn, standing there by the\r\nCommodore, is sailing under false colours; he’s an impostor, I say; he\r\nwears my crown.”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha!” laughed Jack, now seeing into the joke, and willing to humour\r\nit; “though I’m born a Briton, boys, yet, by the mast! these Don Pedros\r\nare all Perkin Warbecks. But I say, Jonathan, my lad, don’t pipe your\r\neye now about the loss of your crown; for, look you, we all wear\r\ncrowns, from our cradles to our graves, and though in _double-darbies_\r\nin the _brig_, the Commodore himself can’t unking us.”\r\n\r\n“A riddle, noble Jack.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit; every man who has a sole to his foot has a crown to his\r\nhead. Here’s mine;” and so saying, Jack, removing his tarpaulin,\r\nexhibited a bald spot, just about the bigness of a crown-piece, on the\r\nsummit of his curly and classical head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\nTHE EMPEROR REVIEWS THE PEOPLE AT QUARTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI Beg their Royal Highnesses’ pardons all round, but I had almost\r\nforgotten to chronicle the fact, that with the Emperor came several\r\nother royal Princes—kings for aught we knew—since it was just after the\r\ncelebration of the nuptials of a younger sister of the Brazilian\r\nmonarch to some European royalty. Indeed, the Emperor and his suite\r\nformed a sort of bridal party, only the bride herself was absent.\r\n\r\nThe first reception over, the smoke of the cannonading salute having\r\ncleared away, and the martial outburst of the brass band having also\r\nrolled off to leeward, the people were called down from the yards, and\r\nthe drum beat to quarters.\r\n\r\nTo quarters we went; and there we stood up by our iron bull-dogs, while\r\nour royal and noble visitors promenaded along the batteries, breaking\r\nout into frequent exclamations at our warlike array, the extreme\r\nneatness of our garments, and, above all, the extraordinary polish of\r\nthe _bright-work_ about the great guns, and the marvellous whiteness of\r\nthe decks.\r\n\r\n“Que gosto!” cried a Marquis, with several dry goods samples of ribbon,\r\ntallied with bright buttons, hanging from his breast.\r\n\r\n“Que gloria!” cried a crooked, coffee-coloured Viscount, spreading both\r\npalms.\r\n\r\n“Que alegria!” cried a little Count, mincingly circumnavigating a\r\nshot-box.\r\n\r\n“Que contentamento he o meu!” cried the Emperor himself, complacently\r\nfolding his royal arms, and serenely gazing along our ranks.\r\n\r\n_Pleasure, Glory_, and _Joy_—this was the burden of the three noble\r\ncourtiers. _And very pleasing indeed_—was the simple rendering of Don\r\nPedro’s imperial remark.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay,” growled a grim rammer-and-sponger behind me; “it’s all\r\ndevilish fine for you nobs to look at; but what would you say if you\r\nhad to holy-stone the deck yourselves, and wear out your elbows in\r\npolishing this cursed old iron, besides getting a dozen at the gangway,\r\nif you dropped a grease-spot on deck in your mess? Ay, ay, devilish\r\nfine for you, but devilish dull for us!”\r\n\r\nIn due time the drums beat the retreat, and the ship’s company\r\nscattered over the decks.\r\n\r\nSome of the officers now assumed the part of cicerones, to show the\r\ndistinguished strangers the bowels of the frigate, concerning which\r\nseveral of them showed a good deal of intelligent curiosity. A guard of\r\nhonour, detached from the marine corps, accompanied them, and they made\r\nthe circuit of the berth-deck, where, at a judicious distance, the\r\nEmperor peeped down into the cable-tier, a very subterranean vault.\r\n\r\nThe Captain of the Main-Hold, who there presided, made a polite bow in\r\nthe twilight, and respectfully expressed a desire for His Royal Majesty\r\nto step down and honour him with a call; but, with his handkerchief to\r\nhis Imperial nose, his Majesty declined. The party then commenced the\r\nascent to the spar-deck; which, from so great a depth in a frigate, is\r\nsomething like getting up to the top of Bunker Hill Monument from the\r\nbasement.\r\n\r\nWhile a crowd of people was gathered about the forward part of the\r\nbooms, a sudden cry was heard from below; a lieutenant came running\r\nforward to learn the cause, when an old sheet-anchor-man, standing by,\r\nafter touching his hat hitched up his waistbands, and replied, “I don’t\r\nknow, sir, but I’m thinking as how one o’ them ’ere kings has been\r\ntumblin’ down the hatchway.”\r\n\r\nAnd something like this it turned out. In ascending one of the narrow\r\nladders leading from the berth-deck to the gun-deck, the Most Noble\r\nMarquis of Silva, in the act of elevating the Imperial coat-tails, so\r\nas to protect them from rubbing against the newly-painted combings of\r\nthe hatchway, this noble marquis’s sword, being an uncommonly long one,\r\nhad caught between his legs, and tripped him head over heels down into\r\nthe fore-passage.\r\n\r\n“Onde ides?” (where are you going?) said his royal master, tranquilly\r\npeeping down toward the falling Marquis; “and what did you let go of my\r\ncoat-tails for?” he suddenly added, in a passion, glancing round at the\r\nsame time, to see if they had suffered from the unfaithfulness of his\r\ntrain bearer.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lord!” sighed the Captain of the Fore-top, “who would be a Marquis\r\nof Silva?”\r\n\r\nUpon being assisted to the spar-deck, the unfortunate Marquis was found\r\nto have escaped without serious harm; but, from the marked coolness of\r\nhis royal master, when the Marquis drew near to apologise for his\r\nawkwardness, it was plain that he was condemned to languish for a time\r\nunder the royal displeasure.\r\n\r\nShortly after, the Imperial party withdrew, under another grand\r\nnational salute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\nA QUARTER-DECK OFFICER BEFORE THE MAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we were somewhat short-handed while we lay in Rio, we received a\r\nsmall draft of men from a United States sloop of war, whose three\r\nyears’ term of service would expire about the time of our arrival in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nUnder guard of an armed Lieutenant and four midshipmen, they came on\r\nboard in the afternoon. They were immediately mustered in the starboard\r\ngangway, that Mr. Bridewell, our First Lieutenant, might take down\r\ntheir names, and assign them their stations.\r\n\r\nThey stood in a mute and solemn row; the officer advanced, with his\r\nmemorandum-book and pencil.\r\n\r\nMy casual friend, Shakings, the holder, happened to be by at the time.\r\nTouching my arm, he said, “White-Jacket, this here reminds me of\r\nSing-Sing, when a draft of fellows in darbies, came on from the State\r\nPrison at Auburn for a change of scene like, you know!”\r\n\r\nAfter taking down four or five names, Mr. Bridewell accosted the next\r\nman, a rather good-looking person, but, from his haggard cheek and\r\nsunken eye, he seemed to have been in the sad habit, all his life, of\r\nsitting up rather late at night; and though all sailors do certainly\r\nkeep late hours enough—standing watches at midnight—yet there is no\r\nsmall difference between keeping late hours at sea and keeping late\r\nhours ashore.\r\n\r\n“What’s your name?” asked the officer, of this rather rakish-looking\r\nrecruit.\r\n\r\n“Mandeville, sir,” said the man, courteously touching his cap. “You\r\nmust remember me, sir,” he added, in a low, confidential tone,\r\nstrangely dashed with servility; “we sailed together once in the old\r\nMacedonian, sir. I wore an epaulet then; we had the same state-room,\r\nyou know, sir. I’m your old chum, Mandeville, sir,” and he again\r\ntouched his cap.\r\n\r\n“I remember an _officer_ by that name,” said the First Lieutenant,\r\nemphatically, “and I know _you_, fellow. But I know you henceforth for\r\na common sailor. I can show no favouritism here. If you ever violate\r\nthe ship’s rules, you shall be flogged like any other seaman. I place\r\nyou in the fore-top; go forward to your duty.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed this Mandeville had entered the Navy when very young, and had\r\nrisen to be a lieutenant, as he said. But brandy had been his bane. One\r\nnight, when he had the deck of a line-of-battle ship, in the\r\nMediterranean, he was seized with a fit of mania-a-potu, and being out\r\nof his senses for the time, went below and turned into his berth,\r\nleaving the deck without a commanding officer. For this unpardonable\r\noffence he was broken.\r\n\r\nHaving no fortune, and no other profession than the sea, upon his\r\ndisgrace he entered the merchant-service as a chief mate; but his love\r\nof strong drink still pursuing him, he was again cashiered at sea, and\r\ndegraded before the mast by the Captain. After this, in a state of\r\nintoxication, he re-entered the Navy at Pensacola as a common sailor.\r\nBut all these lessons, so biting-bitter to learn, could not cure him of\r\nhis sin. He had hardly been a week on board the Neversink, when he was\r\nfound intoxicated with smuggled spirits. They lashed him to the\r\ngratings, and ignominiously scourged him under the eye of his old\r\nfriend and comrade, the First Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThis took place while we lay in port, which reminds me of the\r\ncircumstance, that when punishment is about to be inflicted in harbour,\r\nall strangers are ordered ashore; and the sentries at the side have it\r\nin strict charge to waive off all boats drawing near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\nA MAN-OF-WAR BUTTON DIVIDES TWO BROTHERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conduct of Mandeville, in claiming the acquaintance of the First\r\nLieutenant under such disreputable circumstances was strongly\r\ncontrasted by the behaviour of another person on board, placed for a\r\ntime in a somewhat similar situation.\r\n\r\nAmong the genteel youths of the after-guard was a lad of about sixteen,\r\na very handsome young fellow, with starry eyes, curly hair of a golden\r\ncolour, and a bright, sunshiny complexion: he must have been the son of\r\nsome goldsmith. He was one of the few sailors—not in the main-top—whom\r\nI used to single out for occasional conversation. After several\r\nfriendly interviews he became quite frank, and communicated certain\r\nportions of his history. There is some charm in the sea, which induces\r\nmost persons to be very communicative concerning themselves.\r\n\r\nWe had lain in Rio but a day, when I observed that this lad—whom I\r\nshall here call Frank—wore an unwonted expression of sadness, mixed\r\nwith apprehension. I questioned him as to the cause, but he chose to\r\nconceal it. Not three days after, he abruptly accosted me on the\r\ngun-deck, where I happened to be taking a promenade.\r\n\r\n“I can’t keep it to myself any more,” he said; “I must have a\r\nconfidant, or I shall go mad!”\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” said I, in alarm.\r\n\r\n“Matter enough—look at this!” and he handed me a torn half sheet of an\r\nold New York _Herald_, putting his finger upon a particular word in a\r\nparticular paragraph. It was the announcement of the sailing from the\r\nBrooklyn Navy-yard of a United States store ship, with provisions for\r\nthe squadron in Rio. It was upon a particular name, in the list of\r\nofficers and midshipmen, that Frank’s fingers was placed.\r\n\r\n“That is my own brother,” said he; “he must have got a reefer’s warrant\r\nsince I left home. Now, White-Jacket, what’s to be done? I have\r\ncalculated that the store ship may be expected here every day; my\r\nbrother will then see me—he an officer and I a miserable sailor that\r\nany moment may be flogged at the gangway, before his very eyes.\r\nHeavens! White-Jacket, what shall I do? Would you run? Do you think\r\nthere is any chance to desert? I won’t see him, by Heaven, with this\r\nsailor’s frock on, and he with the anchor button!”\r\n\r\n“Why, Frank,” said I, “I do not really see sufficient cause for this\r\nfit you are in. Your brother is an of officer—very good; and you are\r\nnothing but a sailor—but that is no disgrace. If he comes on board\r\nhere, go up to him, and take him by the hand; believe me, he will be\r\nglad enough to see you!”\r\n\r\nFrank started from his desponding attitude, and fixing his eyes full\r\nupon mine, with clasped hands exclaimed, “White-Jacket, I have been\r\nfrom home nearly three years; in that time I have never heard one word\r\nfrom my family, and, though God knows how I love them, yet I swear to\r\nyou, that though my brother can tell me whether my sisters are still\r\nalive, yet, rather than accost him in this _lined-frock_, I would go\r\nten centuries without hearing one syllable from home?”\r\n\r\nAmazed at his earnestness, and hardly able to account for it\r\naltogether, I stood silent a moment; then said, “Why, Frank, this\r\nmidshipman is your own brother, you say; now, do you really think that\r\nyour own flesh and blood is going to give himself airs over you, simply\r\nbecause he sports large brass buttons on his coat? Never believe it. If\r\nhe does, he can be no brother, and ought to be hanged—that’s all!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t say that again,” said Frank, resentfully; “my brother is a\r\nnoble-hearted fellow; I love him as I do myself. You don’t understand\r\nme, White-Jacket; don’t you see, that when my brother arrives, he must\r\nconsort more or less with our chuckle-headed reefers on board here?\r\nThere’s that namby-pamby Miss Nancy of a white-face, Stribbles, who,\r\nthe other day, when Mad Jack’s back was turned, ordered me to hand him\r\nthe spy-glass, as if he were a Commodore. Do you suppose, now, I want\r\nmy brother to see me a lackey abroad here? By Heaven it is enough to\r\ndrive one distracted! What’s to be done?” he cried, fiercely.\r\n\r\nMuch more passed between us, but all my philosophy was in vain, and at\r\nlast Frank departed, his head hanging down in despondency.\r\n\r\nFor several days after, whenever the quarter-master reported a sail\r\nentering the harbour, Frank was foremost in the rigging to observe it.\r\nAt length, one afternoon, a vessel drawing near was reported to be the\r\nlong-expected store ship. I looked round for Frank on the spar-deck,\r\nbut he was nowhere to be seen. He must have been below, gazing out of a\r\nport-hole. The vessel was hailed from our poop, and came to anchor\r\nwithin a biscuit’s toss of our batteries.\r\n\r\nThat evening I heard that Frank had ineffectually endeavoured to get\r\nremoved from his place as an oarsman in the First-Cutter—a boat which,\r\nfrom its size, is generally employed with the launch in carrying\r\nship-stores. When I thought that, the very next day, perhaps, this boat\r\nwould be plying between the store ship and our frigate, I was at no\r\nloss to account for Frank’s attempts to get rid of his oar, and felt\r\nheartily grieved at their failure.\r\n\r\nNext morning the bugler called away the First-Cutter’s crew, and Frank\r\nentered the boat with his hat slouched over his eyes. Upon his return,\r\nI was all eagerness to learn what had happened, and, as the\r\ncommunication of his feelings was a grateful relief, he poured his\r\nwhole story into my ear.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that, with his comrades, he mounted the store ship’s side,\r\nand hurried forward to the forecastle. Then, turning anxiously toward\r\nthe quarter-deck, he spied two midshipmen leaning against the bulwarks,\r\nconversing. One was the officer of his boat—was the other his brother?\r\nNo; he was too tall—too large. Thank Heaven! it was not him. And\r\nperhaps his brother had not sailed from home, after all; there might\r\nhave been some mistake. But suddenly the strange midshipman laughed\r\naloud, and that laugh Frank had heard a thousand times before. It was a\r\nfree, hearty laugh—a brother’s laugh; but it carried a pang to the\r\nheart of poor Frank.\r\n\r\nHe was now ordered down to the main-deck to assist in removing the\r\nstores. The boat being loaded, he was ordered into her, when, looking\r\ntoward the gangway, he perceived the two midshipmen lounging upon each\r\nside of it, so that no one could pass them without brushing their\r\npersons. But again pulling his hat over his eyes, Frank, darting\r\nbetween them, gained his oar. “How my heart thumped,” he said, “when I\r\nactually, felt him so near me; but I wouldn’t look at him—no! I’d have\r\ndied first!”\r\n\r\nTo Frank’s great relief, the store ship at last moved further up the\r\nbay, and it fortunately happened that he saw no more of his brother\r\nwhile in Rio; and while there, he never in any way made himself known\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\nA MAN-OF-WAR’S-MAN SHOT AT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a seaman belonging to the fore-top—a mess-mate, though not a\r\ntop-mate of mine, and no favourite of the Captain’s,—who, for certain\r\nvenial transgressions, had been prohibited from going ashore on liberty\r\nwhen the ship’s company went. Enraged at the deprivation—for he had not\r\ntouched earth in upward of a year—he, some nights after, lowered\r\nhimself overboard, with the view of gaining a canoe, attached by a rope\r\nto a Dutch galiot some cables’-lengths distant. In this canoe he\r\nproposed paddling himself ashore. Not being a very expert swimmer, the\r\ncommotion he made in the water attracted the ear of the sentry on that\r\nside of the ship, who, turning about in his walk, perceived the faint\r\nwhite spot where the fugitive was swimming in the frigate’s shadow. He\r\nhailed it; but no reply.\r\n\r\n“Give the word, or I fire!”\r\n\r\nNot a word was heard.\r\n\r\nThe next instant there was a red flash, and, before it had completely\r\nceased illuminating the night the white spot was changed into crimson.\r\nSome of the officers, returning from a party at the Beach of the\r\nFlamingoes, happened to be drawing near the ship in one of her cutters.\r\nThey saw the flash, and the bounding body it revealed. In a moment the\r\ntopman was dragged into the boat, a handkerchief was used for a\r\ntourniquet, and the wounded fugitive was soon on board the frigate,\r\nwhen, the surgeon being called, the necessary attentions were rendered.\r\n\r\nNow, it appeared, that at the moment the sentry fired, the top-man—in\r\norder to elude discovery, by manifesting the completest quietude—was\r\nfloating on the water, straight and horizontal, as if reposing on a\r\nbed. As he was not far from the ship at the time, and the sentry was\r\nconsiderably elevated above him—pacing his platform, on a level with\r\nthe upper part of the hammock-nettings—the ball struck with great\r\nforce, with a downward obliquity, entering the right thigh just above\r\nthe knee, and, penetrating some inches, glanced upward along the bone,\r\nburying itself somewhere, so that it could not be felt by outward\r\nmanipulation. There was no dusky discoloration to mark its internal\r\ntrack, as in the case when a partly-spent ball—obliquely hitting—after\r\nentering the skin, courses on, just beneath the surface, without\r\npenetrating further. Nor was there any mark on the opposite part of the\r\nthigh to denote its place, as when a ball forces itself straight\r\nthrough a limb, and lodges, perhaps, close to the skin on the other\r\nside. Nothing was visible but a small, ragged puncture, bluish about\r\nthe edges, as if the rough point of a tenpenny nail had been forced\r\ninto the flesh, and withdrawn. It seemed almost impossible, that\r\nthrough so small an aperture, a musket-bullet could have penetrated.\r\n\r\nThe extreme misery and general prostration of the man, caused by the\r\ngreat effusion of blood—though, strange to say, at first he said he\r\nfelt no pain from the wound itself—induced the Surgeon, very\r\nreluctantly, to forego an immediate search for the ball, to extract it,\r\nas that would have involved the dilating of the wound by the knife; an\r\noperation which, at that juncture, would have been almost certainly\r\nattended with fatal results. A day or two, therefore, was permitted to\r\npass, while simple dressings were applied.\r\n\r\nThe Surgeon of the other American ships of war in harbour occasionally\r\nvisited the Neversink, to examine the patient, and incidentally to\r\nlisten to the expositions of our own Surgeon, their senior in rank. But\r\nCadwallader Cuticle, who, as yet, has been but incidentally alluded to,\r\nnow deserves a chapter by himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\nTHE SURGEON OF THE FLEET.\r\n\r\n\r\nCadwallader Cuticle, M. D., and Honorary Member of the most\r\ndistinguished Colleges of Surgeons both in Europe and America, was our\r\nSurgeon of the Fleet. Nor was he at all blind to the dignity of his\r\nposition; to which, indeed, he was rendered peculiarly competent, if\r\nthe reputation he enjoyed was deserved. He had the name of being the\r\nforemost Surgeon in the Navy, a gentleman of remarkable science, and a\r\nveteran practitioner.\r\n\r\nHe was a small, withered man, nearly, perhaps quite, sixty years of\r\nage. His chest was shallow, his shoulders bent, his pantaloons hung\r\nround skeleton legs, and his face was singularly attenuated. In truth,\r\nthe corporeal vitality of this man seemed, in a good degree, to have\r\ndied out of him. He walked abroad, a curious patch-work of life and\r\ndeath, with a wig, one glass eye, and a set of false teeth, while his\r\nvoice was husky and thick; but his mind seemed undebilitated as in\r\nyouth; it shone out of his remaining eye with basilisk brilliancy.\r\n\r\nLike most old physicians and surgeons who have seen much service, and\r\nhave been promoted to high professional place for their scientific\r\nattainments, this Cuticle was an enthusiast in his calling. In private,\r\nhe had once been heard to say, confidentially, that he would rather cut\r\noff a man’s arm than dismember the wing of the most delicate pheasant.\r\nIn particular, the department of Morbid Anatomy was his peculiar love;\r\nand in his state-room below he had a most unsightly collection of\r\nParisian casts, in plaster and wax, representing all imaginable\r\nmalformations of the human members, both organic and induced by\r\ndisease. Chief among these was a cast, often to be met with in the\r\nAnatomical Museums of Europe, and no doubt an unexaggerated copy of a\r\ngenuine original; it was the head of an elderly woman, with an aspect\r\nsingularly gentle and meek, but at the same time wonderfully expressive\r\nof a gnawing sorrow, never to be relieved. You would almost have\r\nthought it the face of some abbess, for some unspeakable crime\r\nvoluntarily sequestered from human society, and leading a life of\r\nagonised penitence without hope; so marvellously sad and tearfully\r\npitiable was this head. But when you first beheld it, no such emotions\r\never crossed your mind. All your eyes and all your horrified soul were\r\nfast fascinated and frozen by the sight of a hideous, crumpled horn,\r\nlike that of a ram, downward growing out from the forehead, and partly\r\nshadowing the face; but as you gazed, the freezing fascination of its\r\nhorribleness gradually waned, and then your whole heart burst with\r\nsorrow, as you contemplated those aged features, ashy pale and wan. The\r\nhorn seemed the mark of a curse for some mysterious sin, conceived and\r\ncommitted before the spirit had entered the flesh. Yet that sin seemed\r\nsomething imposed, and not voluntarily sought; some sin growing out of\r\nthe heartless necessities of the predestination of things; some sin\r\nunder which the sinner sank in sinless woe.\r\n\r\nBut no pang of pain, not the slightest touch of concern, ever crossed\r\nthe bosom of Cuticle when he looked on this cast. It was immovably\r\nfixed to a bracket, against the partition of his state-room, so that it\r\nwas the first object that greeted his eyes when he opened them from his\r\nnightly sleep. Nor was it to hide the face, that upon retiring, he\r\nalways hung his Navy cap upon the upward curling extremity of the horn,\r\nfor that obscured it but little.\r\n\r\nThe Surgeon’s cot-boy, the lad who made up his swinging bed and took\r\ncare of his room, often told us of the horror he sometimes felt when he\r\nwould find himself alone in his master’s retreat. At times he was\r\nseized with the idea that Cuticle was a preternatural being; and once\r\nentering his room in the middle watch of the night, he started at\r\nfinding it enveloped in a thick, bluish vapour, and stifling with the\r\nodours of brimstone. Upon hearing a low groan from the smoke, with a\r\nwild cry he darted from the place, and, rousing the occupants of the\r\nneighbouring state-rooms, it was found that the vapour proceeded from\r\nsmouldering bunches of lucifer matches, which had become ignited\r\nthrough the carelessness of the Surgeon. Cuticle, almost dead, was\r\ndragged from the suffocating atmosphere, and it was several days ere he\r\ncompletely recovered from its effects. This accident took place\r\nimmediately over the powder magazine; but as Cuticle, during his\r\nsickness, paid dearly enough for transgressing the laws prohibiting\r\ncombustibles in the gun-room, the Captain contented himself with\r\nprivately remonstrating with him.\r\n\r\nWell knowing the enthusiasm of the Surgeon for all specimens of morbid\r\nanatomy, some of the ward-room officers used to play upon his\r\ncredulity, though, in every case, Cuticle was not long in discovering\r\ntheir deceptions. Once, when they had some sago pudding for dinner, and\r\nCuticle chanced to be ashore, they made up a neat parcel of this\r\nbluish-white, firm, jelly-like preparation, and placing it in a tin\r\nbox, carefully sealed with wax, they deposited it on the gun-room\r\ntable, with a note, purporting to come from an eminent physician in\r\nRio, connected with the Grand National Museum on the Praca d’\r\nAcclamacao, begging leave to present the scientific Senhor Cuticle—with\r\nthe donor’s compliments—an uncommonly fine specimen of a cancer.\r\n\r\nDescending to the ward-room, Cuticle spied the note, and no sooner read\r\nit, than, clutching the case, he opened it, and exclaimed, “Beautiful!\r\nsplendid! I have never seen a finer specimen of this most interesting\r\ndisease.”\r\n\r\n“What have you there, Surgeon Cuticle?” said a Lieutenant, advancing.\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, look at it; did you ever see anything more exquisite?”\r\n\r\n“Very exquisite indeed; let me have a bit of it, will you, Cuticle?”\r\n\r\n“Let you have a bit of it!” shrieked the Surgeon, starting back. “Let\r\nyou have one of my limbs! I wouldn’t mar so large a specimen for a\r\nhundred dollars; but what can you want of it? You are not making\r\ncollections!”\r\n\r\n“I’m fond of the article,” said the Lieutenant; “it’s a fine cold\r\nrelish to bacon or ham. You know, I was in New Zealand last cruise,\r\nCuticle, and got into sad dissipation there among the cannibals; come,\r\nlet’s have a bit, if it’s only a mouthful.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you infernal Feejee!” shouted Cuticle, eyeing the other with a\r\nconfounded expression; “you don’t really mean to eat a piece of this\r\ncancer?”\r\n\r\n“Hand it to me, and see whether I will not,” was the reply.\r\n\r\n“In God’s name, take it!” cried the Surgeon, putting the case into his\r\nhands, and then standing with his own uplifted.\r\n\r\n“Steward!” cried the Lieutenant, “the castor—quick! I always use plenty\r\nof pepper with this dish, Surgeon; it’s oystery. Ah! this is really\r\ndelicious,” he added, smacking his lips over a mouthful. “Try it now,\r\nSurgeon, and you’ll never keep such a fine dish as this, lying uneaten\r\non your hands, as a mere scientific curiosity.”\r\n\r\nCuticle’s whole countenance changed; and, slowly walking up to the\r\ntable, he put his nose close to the tin case, then touched its contents\r\nwith his finger and tasted it. Enough. Buttoning up his coat, in all\r\nthe tremblings of an old man’s rage he burst from the ward-room, and,\r\ncalling for a boat, was not seen again for twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nBut though, like all other mortals, Cuticle was subject at times to\r\nthese fits of passion—at least under outrageous provocation—nothing\r\ncould exceed his coolness when actually employed in his imminent\r\nvocation. Surrounded by moans and shrieks, by features distorted with\r\nanguish inflicted by himself, he yet maintained a countenance almost\r\nsupernaturally calm; and unless the intense interest of the operation\r\nflushed his wan face with a momentary tinge of professional enthusiasm,\r\nhe toiled away, untouched by the keenest misery coming under a\r\nfleet-surgeon’s eye. Indeed, long habituation to the dissecting-room\r\nand the amputation-table had made him seemingly impervious to the\r\nordinary emotions of humanity. Yet you could not say that Cuticle was\r\nessentially a cruel-hearted man. His apparent heartlessness must have\r\nbeen of a purely scientific origin. It is not to be imagined even that\r\nCuticle would have harmed a fly, unless he could procure a microscope\r\npowerful enough to assist him in experimenting on the minute vitals of\r\nthe creature.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding his marvellous indifference to the sufferings of\r\nhis patients, and spite even of his enthusiasm in his vocation—not\r\ncooled by frosting old age itself—Cuticle, on some occasions, would\r\neffect a certain disrelish of his profession, and declaim against the\r\nnecessity that forced a man of his humanity to perform a surgical\r\noperation. Especially was it apt to be thus with him, when the case was\r\none of more than ordinary interest. In discussing it previous to\r\nsetting about it, he would veil his eagerness under an aspect of great\r\ncircumspection, curiously marred, however, by continual sallies of\r\nunsuppressible impatience. But the knife once in his hand, the\r\ncompassionless surgeon himself, undisguised, stood before you. Such was\r\nCadwallader Cuticle, our Surgeon of the Fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\nA CONSULTATION OF MAN-OF-WAR SURGEONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems customary for the Surgeon of the Fleet, when any important\r\noperation in his department is on the anvil, and there is nothing to\r\nabsorb professional attention from it, to invite his brother surgeons,\r\nif at hand at the time, to a ceremonious consultation upon it. And\r\nthis, in courtesy, his brother surgeons expect.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this custom, then, the surgeons of the neighbouring\r\nAmerican ships of war were requested to visit the Neversink in a body,\r\nto advise concerning the case of the top-man, whose situation had now\r\nbecome critical. They assembled on the half-deck, and were soon joined\r\nby their respected senior, Cuticle. In a body they bowed as he\r\napproached, and accosted him with deferential regard.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said Cuticle, unostentatiously seating himself on a\r\ncamp-stool, handed him by his cot-boy, “we have here an extremely\r\ninteresting case. You have all seen the patient, I believe. At first I\r\nhad hopes that I should have been able to cut down to the ball, and\r\nremove it; but the state of the patient forbade. Since then, the\r\ninflammation and sloughing of the part has been attended with a copious\r\nsuppuration, great loss of substance, extreme debility and emaciation.\r\nFrom this, I am convinced that the ball has shattered and deadened the\r\nbone, and now lies impacted in the medullary canal. In fact, there can\r\nbe no doubt that the wound is incurable, and that amputation is the\r\nonly resource. But, gentlemen, I find myself placed in a very delicate\r\npredicament. I assure you I feel no professional anxiety to perform the\r\noperation. I desire your advice, and if you will now again visit the\r\npatient with me, we can then return here and decide what is best to be\r\ndone. Once more, let me say, that I feel no personal anxiety whatever\r\nto use the knife.”\r\n\r\nThe assembled surgeons listened to this address with the most serious\r\nattention, and, in accordance with their superior’s desire, now\r\ndescended to the sick-bay, where the patient was languishing. The\r\nexamination concluded, they returned to the half-deck, and the\r\nconsultation was renewed.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” began Cuticle, again seating himself, “you have now just\r\ninspected the limb; you have seen that there is no resource but\r\namputation; and now, gentlemen, what do you say? Surgeon Bandage, of\r\nthe Mohawk, will you express your opinion?”\r\n\r\n“The wound is a very serious one,” said Bandage—a corpulent man, with a\r\nhigh German forehead—shaking his head solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Can anything save him but amputation?” demanded Cuticle.\r\n\r\n“His constitutional debility is extreme,” observed Bandage, “but I have\r\nseen more dangerous cases.”\r\n\r\n“Surgeon Wedge, of the Malay,” said Cuticle, in a pet, “be pleased to\r\ngive _your_ opinion; and let it be definitive, I entreat:” this was\r\nsaid with a severe glance toward Bandage.\r\n\r\n“If I thought,” began Wedge, a very spare, tall man, elevating himself\r\nstill higher on his toes, “that the ball had shattered and divided the\r\nwhole _femur_, including the _Greater_ and _Lesser Trochanter_ the\r\n_Linear aspera_ the _Digital fossa_, and the _Intertrochanteric_, I\r\nshould certainly be in favour of amputation; but that, sir, permit me\r\nto observe, is not my opinion.”\r\n\r\n“Surgeon Sawyer, of the Buccaneer,” said Cuticle, drawing in his thin\r\nlower lip with vexation, and turning to a round-faced, florid, frank,\r\nsensible-looking man, whose uniform coat very handsomely fitted him,\r\nand was adorned with an unusual quantity of gold lace; “Surgeon Sawyer,\r\nof the Buccaneer, let us now hear _your_ opinion, if you please. Is not\r\namputation the only resource, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” said Sawyer, “I am decidedly opposed to it; for if\r\nhitherto the patient has not been strong enough to undergo the\r\nextraction of the ball, I do not see how he can be expected to endure a\r\nfar more severe operation. As there is no immediate danger of\r\nmortification, and you say the ball cannot be reached without making\r\nlarge incisions, I should support him, I think, for the present, with\r\ntonics, and gentle antiphlogistics, locally applied. On no account\r\nwould I proceed to amputation until further symptoms are exhibited.”\r\n\r\n“Surgeon Patella, of the Algerine,” said Cuticle, in an ill-suppressed\r\npassion, abruptly turning round on the person addressed, “will _you_\r\nhave the kindness to say whether _you_ do not think that amputation is\r\nthe only resource?”\r\n\r\nNow Patella was the youngest of the company, a modest man, filled with\r\na profound reverence for the science of Cuticle, and desirous of\r\ngaining his good opinion, yet not wishing to commit himself altogether\r\nby a decided reply, though, like Surgeon Sawyer, in his own mind he\r\nmight have been clearly against the operation.\r\n\r\n“What you have remarked, Mr. Surgeon of the Fleet,” said Patella,\r\nrespectfully hemming, “concerning the dangerous condition of the limb,\r\nseems obvious enough; amputation would certainly be a cure to the\r\nwound; but then, as, notwithstanding his present debility, the patient\r\nseems to have a strong constitution, he might rally as it is, and by\r\nyour scientific treatment, Mr. Surgeon of the Fleet”—bowing—“be\r\nentirely made whole, without risking an amputation. Still, it is a very\r\ncritical case, and amputation may be indispensable; and if it is to be\r\nperformed, there ought to be no delay whatever. That is my view of the\r\ncase, Mr. Surgeon of the Fleet.”\r\n\r\n“Surgeon Patella, then, gentlemen,” said Cuticle, turning round\r\ntriumphantly, “is clearly of opinion that amputation should be\r\nimmediately performed. For my own part—individually, I mean, and\r\nwithout respect to the patient—I am sorry to have it so decided. But\r\nthis settles the question, gentlemen—in my own mind, however, it was\r\nsettled before. At ten o’clock to-morrow morning the operation will be\r\nperformed. I shall be happy to see you all on the occasion, and also\r\nyour juniors” (alluding to the absent _Assistant Surgeons_).\r\n“Good-morning, gentlemen; at ten o’clock, remember.”\r\n\r\nAnd Cuticle retreated to the Ward-room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\nTHE OPERATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, at the appointed hour, the surgeons arrived in a body.\r\nThey were accompanied by their juniors, young men ranging in age from\r\nnineteen years to thirty. Like the senior surgeons, these young\r\ngentlemen were arrayed in their blue navy uniforms, displaying a\r\nprofusion of bright buttons, and several broad bars of gold lace about\r\nthe wristbands. As in honour of the occasion, they had put on their\r\nbest coats; they looked exceedingly brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe whole party immediately descended to the half-deck, where\r\npreparations had been made for the operation. A large garrison-ensign\r\nwas stretched across the ship by the main-mast, so as completely to\r\nscreen the space behind. This space included the whole extent aft to\r\nthe bulk-head of the Commodore’s cabin, at the door of which the\r\nmarine-orderly paced, in plain sight, cutlass in hand.\r\n\r\nUpon two gun-carriages, dragged amidships, the Death-board (used for\r\nburials at sea) was horizontally placed, covered with an old\r\nroyal-stun’-sail. Upon this occasion, to do duty as an\r\namputation-table, it was widened by an additional plank. Two\r\nmatch-tubs, near by, placed one upon another, at either end supported\r\nanother plank, distinct from the table, whereon was exhibited an array\r\nof saws and knives of various and peculiar shapes and sizes; also, a\r\nsort of steel, something like the dinner-table implement, together with\r\nlong needles, crooked at the end for taking up the arteries, and large\r\ndarning-needles, thread and bee’s-wax, for sewing up a wound.\r\n\r\nAt the end nearest the larger table was a tin basin of water,\r\nsurrounded by small sponges, placed at mathematical intervals. From the\r\nlong horizontal pole of a great-gun rammer—fixed in its usual place\r\noverhead—hung a number of towels, with “U.S.” marked in the corners.\r\n\r\nAll these arrangements had been made by the “Surgeon’s steward,” a\r\nperson whose important functions in a man-of-war will, in a future\r\nchapter, be entered upon at large. Upon the present occasion, he was\r\nbustling about, adjusting and readjusting the knives, needles, and\r\ncarver, like an over-conscientious butler fidgeting over a dinner-table\r\njust before the convivialists enter.\r\n\r\nBut by far the most striking object to be seen behind the ensign was a\r\nhuman skeleton, whose every joint articulated with wires. By a rivet at\r\nthe apex of the skull, it hung dangling from a hammock-hook fixed in a\r\nbeam above. Why this object was here, will presently be seen; but why\r\nit was placed immediately at the foot of the amputation-table, only\r\nSurgeon Cuticle can tell.\r\n\r\nWhile the final preparations were being made, Cuticle stood conversing\r\nwith the assembled Surgeons and Assistant Surgeons, his invited guests.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” said he, taking up one of the glittering knives and\r\nartistically drawing the steel across it; “Gentlemen, though these\r\nscenes are very unpleasant, and in some moods, I may say, repulsive to\r\nme—yet how much better for our patient to have the contusions and\r\nlacerations of his present wound—with all its dangerous\r\nsymptoms—converted into a clean incision, free from these objections,\r\nand occasioning so much less subsequent anxiety to himself and the\r\nSurgeon. Yes,” he added, tenderly feeling the edge of his knife,\r\n“amputation is our only resource. Is it not so, Surgeon Patella?”\r\nturning toward that gentleman, as if relying upon some sort of an\r\nassent, however clogged with conditions.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Patella, “amputation is your only resource, Mr.\r\nSurgeon of the Fleet; that is, I mean, if you are fully persuaded of\r\nits necessity.”\r\n\r\nThe other surgeons said nothing, maintaining a somewhat reserved air,\r\nas if conscious that they had no positive authority in the case,\r\nwhatever might be their own private opinions; but they seemed willing\r\nto behold, and, if called upon, to assist at the operation, since it\r\ncould not now be averted.\r\n\r\nThe young men, their Assistants, looked very eager, and cast frequent\r\nglances of awe upon so distinguished a practitioner as the venerable\r\nCuticle.\r\n\r\n“They say he can drop a leg in one minute and ten seconds from the\r\nmoment the knife touches it,” whispered one of them to another.\r\n\r\n“We shall see,” was the reply, and the speaker clapped his hand to his\r\nfob, to see if his watch would be forthcoming when wanted.\r\n\r\n“Are you all ready here?” demanded Cuticle, now advancing to his\r\nsteward; “have not those fellows got through yet?” pointing to three\r\nmen of the carpenter’s gang, who were placing bits of wood under the\r\ngun-carriages supporting the central table.\r\n\r\n“They are just through, sir,” respectfully answered the steward,\r\ntouching his hand to his forehead, as if there were a cap-front there.\r\n\r\n“Bring up the patient, then,” said Cuticle.\r\n\r\n“Young gentlemen,” he added, turning to the row of Assistant Surgeons,\r\n“seeing you here reminds me of the classes of students once under my\r\ninstruction at the Philadelphia College of Physicians and Surgeons. Ah,\r\nthose were happy days!” he sighed, applying the extreme corner of his\r\nhandkerchief to his glass-eye. “Excuse an old man’s emotions, young\r\ngentlemen; but when I think of the numerous rare cases that then came\r\nunder my treatment, I cannot but give way to my feelings. The town, the\r\ncity, the metropolis, young gentlemen, is the place for you students;\r\nat least in these dull times of peace, when the army and navy furnish\r\nno inducements for a youth ambitious of rising in our honourable\r\nprofession. Take an old man’s advice, and if the war now threatening\r\nbetween the States and Mexico should break out, exchange your navy\r\ncommissions for commissions in the army. From having no military marine\r\nherself, Mexico has always been backward in furnishing subjects for the\r\namputation-tables of foreign navies. The cause of science has\r\nlanguished in her hands. The army, young gentlemen, is your best\r\nschool; depend upon it. You will hardly believe it, Surgeon Bandage,”\r\nturning to that gentleman, “but this is my first important case of\r\nsurgery in a nearly three years’ cruise. I have been almost wholly\r\nconfined in this ship to doctor’s practice prescribing for fevers and\r\nfluxes. True, the other day a man fell from the mizzen-top-sail-yard;\r\nbut that was merely an aggravated case of dislocations and bones\r\nsplintered and broken. No one, sir, could have made an amputation of\r\nit, without severely contusing his conscience. And mine—I may say it,\r\ngentlemen, without ostentation is—peculiarly susceptible.”\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, the knife and carver touchingly dropped to his sides,\r\nand he stood for a moment fixed in a tender reverie but a commotion\r\nbeing heard beyond the curtain, he started, and, briskly crossing and\r\nrecrossing the knife and carver, exclaimed, “Ali, here comes our\r\npatient; surgeons, this side of the table, if you please; young\r\ngentlemen, a little further off, I beg. Steward, take off my coat—so;\r\nmy neckerchief now; I must be perfectly unencumbered, Surgeon Patella,\r\nor I can do nothing whatever.”\r\n\r\nThese articles being removed, he snatched off his wig, placing it on\r\nthe gun-deck capstan; then took out his set of false teeth, and placed\r\nit by the side of the wig; and, lastly, putting his forefinger to the\r\ninner angle of his blind eye, spirited out the glass optic with\r\nprofessional dexterity, and deposited that, also, next to the wig and\r\nfalse teeth.\r\n\r\nThus divested of nearly all inorganic appurtenances, what was left of\r\nthe Surgeon slightly shook itself, to see whether anything more could\r\nbe spared to advantage.\r\n\r\n“Carpenter’s mates,” he now cried, “will you never get through with\r\nthat job?”\r\n\r\n“Almost through, sir—just through,” they replied, staring round in\r\nsearch of the strange, unearthly voice that addressed them; for the\r\nabsence of his teeth had not at all improved the conversational tones\r\nof the Surgeon of the Fleet.\r\n\r\nWith natural curiosity, these men had purposely been lingering, to see\r\nall they could; but now, having no further excuse, they snatched up\r\ntheir hammers and chisels, and—like the stage-builders decamping from a\r\npublic meeting at the eleventh hour, after just completing the rostrum\r\nin time for the first speaker—the Carpenter’s gang withdrew.\r\n\r\nThe broad ensign now lifted, revealing a glimpse of the crowd of\r\nman-of-war’s-men outside, and the patient, borne in the arms of two of\r\nhis mess-mates, entered the place. He was much emaciated, weak as an\r\ninfant, and every limb visibly trembled, or rather jarred, like the\r\nhead of a man with the palsy. As if an organic and involuntary\r\napprehension of death had seized the wounded leg, its nervous motions\r\nwere so violent that one of the mess-mates was obliged to keep his hand\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nThe top-man was immediately stretched upon the table, the attendants\r\nsteadying his limbs, when, slowly opening his eyes, he glanced about at\r\nthe glittering knives and saws, the towels and sponges, the armed\r\nsentry at the Commodore’s cabin-door, the row of eager-eyed students,\r\nthe meagre death’s-head of a Cuticle, now with his shirt sleeves rolled\r\nup upon his withered arms, and knife in hand, and, finally, his eyes\r\nsettled in horror upon the skeleton, slowly vibrating and jingling\r\nbefore him, with the slow, slight roll of the frigate in the water.\r\n\r\n“I would advise perfect repose of your every limb, my man,” said\r\nCuticle, addressing him; “the precision of an operation is often\r\nimpaired by the inconsiderate restlessness of the patient. But if you\r\nconsider, my good fellow,” he added, in a patronising and almost\r\nsympathetic tone, and slightly pressing his hand on the limb, “if you\r\nconsider how much better it is to live with three limbs than to die\r\nwith four, and especially if you but knew to what torments both sailors\r\nand soldiers were subjected before the time of Celsus, owing to the\r\nlamentable ignorance of surgery then prevailing, you would certainly\r\nthank God from the bottom of your heart that _your_ operation has been\r\npostponed to the period of this enlightened age, blessed with a Bell, a\r\nBrodie, and a Lally. My man, before Celsus’s time, such was the general\r\nignorance of our noble science, that, in order to prevent the excessive\r\neffusion of blood, it was deemed indispensable to operate with a\r\nred-hot knife”—making a professional movement toward the thigh—“and\r\npour scalding oil upon the parts”—elevating his elbow, as if with a\r\ntea-pot in his hand—“still further to sear them, after amputation had\r\nbeen performed.”\r\n\r\n“He is fainting!” said one of his mess-mates; “quick! some water!” The\r\nsteward immediately hurried to the top-man with the basin.\r\n\r\nCuticle took the top-man by the wrist, and feeling it a while,\r\nobserved, “Don’t be alarmed, men,” addressing the two mess-mates;\r\n“he’ll recover presently; this fainting very generally takes place.”\r\nAnd he stood for a moment, tranquilly eyeing the patient.\r\n\r\nNow the Surgeon of the Fleet and the top-man presented a spectacle\r\nwhich, to a reflecting mind, was better than a church-yard sermon on\r\nthe mortality of man.\r\n\r\nHere was a sailor, who four days previous, had stood erect—a pillar of\r\nlife—with an arm like a royal-mast and a thigh like a windlass. But the\r\nslightest conceivable finger-touch of a bit of crooked trigger had\r\neventuated in stretching him out, more helpless than an hour-old babe,\r\nwith a blasted thigh, utterly drained of its brawn. And who was it that\r\nnow stood over him like a superior being, and, as if clothed himself\r\nwith the attributes of immortality, indifferently discoursed of carving\r\nup his broken flesh, and thus piecing out his abbreviated days. Who was\r\nit, that in capacity of Surgeon, seemed enacting the part of a\r\nRegenerator of life? The withered, shrunken, one-eyed, toothless,\r\nhairless Cuticle; with a trunk half dead—a _memento mori_ to behold!\r\n\r\nAnd while, in those soul-sinking and panic-striking premonitions of\r\nspeedy death which almost invariably accompany a severe gun-shot wound,\r\neven with the most intrepid spirits; while thus drooping and dying,\r\nthis once robust top-man’s eye was now waning in his head like a\r\nLapland moon being eclipsed in clouds—Cuticle, who for years had still\r\nlived in his withered tabernacle of a body—Cuticle, no doubt sharing in\r\nthe common self-delusion of old age—Cuticle must have felt his hold of\r\nlife as secure as the grim hug of a grizzly bear. Verily, Life is more\r\nawful than Death; and let no man, though his live heart beat in him\r\nlike a cannon—let him not hug his life to himself; for, in the\r\npredestinated necessities of things, that bounding life of his is not a\r\nwhit more secure than the life of a man on his death-bed. To-day we\r\ninhale the air with expanding lungs, and life runs through us like a\r\nthousand Niles; but to-morrow we may collapse in death, and all our\r\nveins be dry as the Brook Kedron in a drought.\r\n\r\n“And now, young gentlemen,” said Cuticle, turning to the Assistant\r\nSurgeons, “while the patient is coming to, permit me to describe to you\r\nthe highly-interesting operation I am about to perform.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Surgeon of the Fleet,” said Surgeon Bandage, “if you are about to\r\nlecture, permit me to present you with your teeth; they will make your\r\ndiscourse more readily understood.” And so saying, Bandage, with a bow,\r\nplaced the two semicircles of ivory into Cuticle’s hands.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Surgeon Bandage,” said Cuticle, and slipped the ivory into\r\nits place.\r\n\r\n“In the first place, now, young gentlemen, let me direct your attention\r\nto the excellent preparation before you. I have had it unpacked from\r\nits case, and set up here from my state-room, where it occupies the\r\nspare berth; and all this for your express benefit, young gentlemen.\r\nThis skeleton I procured in person from the Hunterian department of the\r\nRoyal College of Surgeons in London. It is a masterpiece of art. But we\r\nhave no time to examine it now. Delicacy forbids that I should amplify\r\nat a juncture like this”—casting an almost benignant glance toward the\r\npatient, now beginning to open his eyes; “but let me point out to you\r\nupon this thigh-bone”—disengaging it from the skeleton, with a gentle\r\ntwist—“the precise place where I propose to perform the operation.\r\n_Here_, young gentlemen, _here_ is the place. You perceive it is very\r\nnear the point of articulation with the trunk.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” interposed Surgeon Wedge, rising on his toes, “yes, young\r\ngentlemen, the point of articulation with the _acetabulum_ of the _os\r\ninnominatum_.”\r\n\r\n“Where’s your Bell on Bones, Dick?” whispered one of the assistants to\r\nthe student next him. “Wedge has been spending the whole morning over\r\nit, getting out the hard names.”\r\n\r\n“Surgeon Wedge,” said Cuticle, looking round severely, “we will\r\ndispense with your commentaries, if you please, at present. Now, young\r\ngentlemen, you cannot but perceive, that the point of operation being\r\nso near the trunk and the vitals, it becomes an unusually beautiful\r\none, demanding a steady hand and a true eye; and, after all, the\r\npatient may die under my hands.”\r\n\r\n“Quick, Steward! water, water; he’s fainting again!” cried the two\r\nmess-mates.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be alarmed for your comrade; men,” said Cuticle, turning round.\r\n“I tell you it is not an uncommon thing for the patient to betray some\r\nemotion upon these occasions—most usually manifested by swooning; it is\r\nquite natural it should be so. But we must not delay the operation.\r\nSteward, that knife—no, the next one—there, that’s it. He is coming to,\r\nI think”—feeling the top-man’s wrist. “Are you all ready, sir?”\r\n\r\nThis last observation was addressed to one of the Neversink’s assistant\r\nsurgeons, a tall, lank, cadaverous young man, arrayed in a sort of\r\nshroud of white canvas, pinned about his throat, and completely\r\nenveloping his person. He was seated on a match-tub—the skeleton\r\nswinging near his head—at the foot of the table, in readiness to grasp\r\nthe limb, as when a plank is being severed by a carpenter and his\r\napprentice.\r\n\r\n“The sponges, Steward,” said Cuticle, for the last time taking out his\r\nteeth, and drawing up his shirt sleeves still further. Then, taking the\r\npatient by the wrist, “Stand by, now, you mess-mates; keep hold of his\r\narms; pin him down. Steward, put your hand on the artery; I shall\r\ncommence as soon as his pulse begins to—_now, now!_” Letting fall the\r\nwrist, feeling the thigh carefully, and bowing over it an instant, he\r\ndrew the fatal knife unerringly across the flesh. As it first touched\r\nthe part, the row of surgeons simultaneously dropped their eyes to the\r\nwatches in their hands while the patient lay, with eyes horribly\r\ndistended, in a kind of waking trance. Not a breath was heard; but as\r\nthe quivering flesh parted in a long, lingering gash, a spring of blood\r\nwelled up between the living walls of the wounds, and two thick\r\nstreams, in opposite directions, coursed down the thigh. The sponges\r\nwere instantly dipped in the purple pool; every face present was\r\npinched to a point with suspense; the limb writhed; the man shrieked;\r\nhis mess-mates pinioned him; while round and round the leg went the\r\nunpitying cut.\r\n\r\n“The saw!” said Cuticle.\r\n\r\nInstantly it was in his hand.\r\n\r\nFull of the operation, he was about to apply it, when, looking up, and\r\nturning to the assistant surgeons, he said, “Would any of you young\r\ngentlemen like to apply the saw? A splendid subject!”\r\n\r\nSeveral volunteered; when, selecting one, Cuticle surrendered the\r\ninstrument to him, saying, “Don’t be hurried, now; be steady.”\r\n\r\nWhile the rest of the assistants looked upon their comrade with glances\r\nof envy, he went rather timidly to work; and Cuticle, who was earnestly\r\nregarding him, suddenly snatched the saw from his hand. “Away, butcher!\r\nyou disgrace the profession. Look at _me!_”\r\n\r\nFor a few moments the thrilling, rasping sound was heard; and then the\r\ntop-man seemed parted in twain at the hip, as the leg slowly slid into\r\nthe arms of the pale, gaunt man in the shroud, who at once made away\r\nwith it, and tucked it out of sight under one of the guns.\r\n\r\n“Surgeon Sawyer,” now said Cuticle, courteously turning to the surgeon\r\nof the Mohawk, “would you like to take up the arteries? They are quite\r\nat your service, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Do, Sawyer; be prevailed upon,” said Surgeon Bandage.\r\n\r\nSawyer complied; and while, with some modesty he was conducting the\r\noperation, Cuticle, turning to the row of assistants said, “Young\r\ngentlemen, we will now proceed with our Illustration. Hand me that\r\nbone, Steward.” And taking the thigh-bone in his still bloody hands,\r\nand holding it conspicuously before his auditors, the Surgeon of the\r\nFleet began:\r\n\r\n“Young gentlemen, you will perceive that precisely at this\r\nspot—_here_—to which I previously directed your attention—at the\r\ncorresponding spot precisely—the operation has been performed. About\r\nhere, young gentlemen, here”—lifting his hand some inches from the\r\nbone—“about _here_ the great artery was. But you noticed that I did not\r\nuse the tourniquet; I never do. The forefinger of my steward is far\r\nbetter than a tourniquet, being so much more manageable, and leaving\r\nthe smaller veins uncompressed. But I have been told, young gentlemen,\r\nthat a certain Seignior Seignioroni, a surgeon of Seville, has recently\r\ninvented an admirable substitute for the clumsy, old-fashioned\r\ntourniquet. As I understand it, it is something like a pair of\r\n_calipers_, working with a small Archimedes screw—a very clever\r\ninvention, according to all accounts. For the padded points at the end\r\nof the arches”—arching his forefinger and thumb—“can be so worked as to\r\napproximate in such a way, as to—but you don’t attend to me, young\r\ngentlemen,” he added, all at once starting.\r\n\r\nBeing more interested in the active proceedings of Surgeon Sawyer, who\r\nwas now threading a needle to sew up the overlapping of the stump, the\r\nyoung gentlemen had not scrupled to turn away their attention\r\naltogether from the lecturer.\r\n\r\nA few moments more, and the top-man, in a swoon, was removed below into\r\nthe sick-bay. As the curtain settled again after the patient had\r\ndisappeared, Cuticle, still holding the thigh-bone of the skeleton in\r\nhis ensanguined hands, proceeded with his remarks upon it; and having\r\nconcluded them, added, “Now, young gentlemen, not the least interesting\r\nconsequence of this operation will be the finding of the ball, which,\r\nin case of non-amputation, might have long eluded the most careful\r\nsearch. That ball, young gentlemen, must have taken a most circuitous\r\nroute. Nor, in cases where the direction is oblique, is this at all\r\nunusual. Indeed, the learned Henner gives us a most remarkable—I had\r\nalmost said an incredible—case of a soldier’s neck, where the bullet,\r\nentering at the part called Adam’s Apple—”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Surgeon Wedge, elevating himself, “the _pomum Adami_.”\r\n\r\n“Entering the point called _Adam’s Apple_,” continued Cuticle, severely\r\nemphasising the last two words, “ran completely round the neck, and,\r\nemerging at the same hole it had entered, shot the next man in the\r\nranks. It was afterward extracted, says Renner, from the second man,\r\nand pieces of the other’s skin were found adhering to it. But examples\r\nof foreign substances being received into the body with a ball, young\r\ngentlemen, are frequently observed. Being attached to a United States\r\nship at the time, I happened to be near the spot of the battle of\r\nAyacucho, in Peru. The day after the action, I saw in the barracks of\r\nthe wounded a trooper, who, having been severely injured in the brain,\r\nwent crazy, and, with his own holster-pistol, committed suicide in the\r\nhospital. The ball drove inward a portion of his woollen night-cap——”\r\n\r\n“In the form of a _cul-de-sac_, doubtless,” said the undaunted Wedge.\r\n\r\n“For once, Surgeon Wedge, you use the only term that can be employed;\r\nand let me avail myself of this opportunity to say to you, young\r\ngentlemen, that a man of true science”—expanding his shallow chest a\r\nlittle—“uses but few hard words, and those only when none other will\r\nanswer his purpose; whereas the smatterer in science”—slightly glancing\r\ntoward Wedge—“thinks, that by mouthing hard words, he proves that he\r\nunderstands hard things. Let this sink deep in your minds, young\r\ngentlemen; and, Surgeon Wedge “—with a stiff bow—“permit me to submit\r\nthe reflection to yourself. Well, young gentlemen, the bullet was\r\nafterward extracted by pulling upon the external parts of the\r\n_cul-de-sac_—a simple, but exceedingly beautiful operation. There is a\r\nfine example, somewhat similar, related in Guthrie; but, of course, you\r\nmust have met with it, in so well-known a work as his Treatise upon\r\nGun-shot Wounds. When, upward of twenty years ago, I was with Lord\r\nCochrane, then Admiral of the fleets of this very country”—pointing\r\nshoreward, out of a port-hole—“a sailor of the vessel to which I was\r\nattached, during the blockade of Bahia, had his leg——” But by this time\r\nthe fidgets had completely taken possession of his auditors, especially\r\nof the senior surgeons; and turning upon them abruptly, he added, “But\r\nI will not detain you longer, gentlemen”—turning round upon all the\r\nsurgeons—“your dinners must be waiting you on board your respective\r\nships. But, Surgeon Sawyer, perhaps you may desire to wash your hands\r\nbefore you go. There is the basin, sir; you will find a clean towel on\r\nthe rammer. For myself, I seldom use them”—taking out his handkerchief.\r\n“I must leave you now, gentlemen”—bowing. “To-morrow, at ten, the limb\r\nwill be upon the table, and I shall be happy to see you all upon the\r\noccasion. Who’s there?” turning to the curtain, which then rustled.\r\n\r\n“Please, sir,” said the Steward, entering, “the patient is dead.”\r\n\r\n“The body also, gentlemen, at ten precisely,” said Cuticle, once more\r\nturning round upon his guests. “I predicted that the operation might\r\nprove fatal; he was very much run down. Good-morning;” and Cuticle\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\n“He does not, surely, mean to touch the body?” exclaimed Surgeon\r\nSawyer, with much excitement.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” said Patella, “that’s only his way; he means, doubtless, that\r\nit may be inspected previous to being taken ashore for burial.”\r\n\r\nThe assemblage of gold-laced surgeons now ascended to the quarter-deck;\r\nthe second cutter was called away by the bugler, and, one by one, they\r\nwere dropped aboard of their respective ships.\r\n\r\nThe following evening the mess-mates of the top-man rowed his remains\r\nashore, and buried them in the ever-vernal Protestant cemetery, hard by\r\nthe Beach of the Flamingoes, in plain sight from the bay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\nMAN-OF-WAR TROPHIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the second cutter pulled about among the ships, dropping the\r\nsurgeons aboard the American men-of-war here and there—as a pilot-boat\r\ndistributes her pilots at the mouth of the harbour—she passed several\r\nforeign frigates, two of which, an Englishman and a Frenchman, had\r\nexcited not a little remark on board the Neversink. These vessels often\r\nloosed their sails and exercised yards simultaneously with ourselves,\r\nas if desirous of comparing the respective efficiency of the crews.\r\n\r\nWhen we were nearly ready for sea, the English frigate, weighing her\r\nanchor, made all sail with the sea-breeze, and began showing off her\r\npaces by gliding about among all the men-of-war in harbour, and\r\nparticularly by running down under the Neversink’s stern. Every time\r\nshe drew near, we complimented her by lowering our ensign a little, and\r\ninvariably she courteously returned the salute. She was inviting us to\r\na sailing-match; and it was rumoured that, when we should leave the\r\nbay, our Captain would have no objections to gratify her; for, be it\r\nknown, the Neversink was accounted the fleetest keeled craft sailing\r\nunder the American long-pennant. Perhaps this was the reason why the\r\nstranger challenged us.\r\n\r\nIt may have been that a portion of our crew were the more anxious to\r\nrace with this frigate, from a little circumstance which a few of them\r\ndeemed rather galling. Not many cables’-length distant from our\r\nCommodore’s cabin lay the frigate President, with the red cross of St.\r\nGeorge flying from her peak. As its name imported, this fine craft was\r\nan American born; but having been captured during the last war with\r\nBritain, she now sailed the salt seas as a trophy.\r\n\r\nThink of it, my gallant countrymen, one and all, down the sea-coast and\r\nalong the endless banks of the Ohio and Columbia—think of the twinges\r\nwe sea-patriots must have felt to behold the live-oak of the Floridas\r\nand the pines of green Maine built into the oaken walls of Old England!\r\nBut, to some of the sailors, there was a counterbalancing thought, as\r\ngrateful as the other was galling, and that was, that somewhere,\r\nsailing under the stars and stripes, was the frigate Macedonian, a\r\nBritish-born craft which had once sported the battle-banner of Britain.\r\n\r\nIt has ever been the custom to spend almost any amount of money in\r\nrepairing a captured vessel, in order that she may long survive to\r\ncommemorate the heroism of the conqueror. Thus, in the English Navy,\r\nthere are many Monsieurs of seventy-fours won from the Gaul. But we\r\nAmericans can show but few similar trophies, though, no doubt, we would\r\nmuch like to be able so to do.\r\n\r\nBut I never have beheld any of thee floating trophies without being\r\nreminded of a scene once witnessed in a pioneer village on the western\r\nbank of the Mississippi. Not far from this village, where the stumps of\r\naboriginal trees yet stand in the market-place, some years ago lived a\r\nportion of the remnant tribes of the Sioux Indians, who frequently\r\nvisited the white settlements to purchase trinkets and cloths.\r\n\r\nOne florid crimson evening in July, when the red-hot sun was going down\r\nin a blaze, and I was leaning against a corner in my huntsman’s frock,\r\nlo! there came stalking out of the crimson West a gigantic red-man,\r\nerect as a pine, with his glittering tomahawk, big as a broad-ax,\r\nfolded in martial repose across his chest, Moodily wrapped in his\r\nblanket, and striding like a king on the stage, he promenaded up and\r\ndown the rustic streets, exhibiting on the back of his blanket a crowd\r\nof human hands, rudely delineated in red; one of them seemed recently\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\n“Who is this warrior?” asked I; “and why marches he here? and for what\r\nare these bloody hands?”\r\n\r\n“That warrior is the _Red-Hot Coal_,” said a pioneer in moccasins, by\r\nmy side. “He marches here to show-off his last trophy; every one of\r\nthose hands attests a foe scalped by his tomahawk; and he has just\r\nemerged from Ben Brown’s, the painter, who has sketched the last red\r\nhand that you see; for last night this _Red-Hot Coal_ outburned the\r\n_Yellow Torch_, the chief of a band of the Foxes.”\r\n\r\nPoor savage thought I; and is this the cause of your lofty gait? Do you\r\nstraighten yourself to think that you have committed a murder, when a\r\nchance-falling stone has often done the same? Is it a proud thing to\r\ntopple down six feet perpendicular of immortal manhood, though that\r\nlofty living tower needed perhaps thirty good growing summers to bring\r\nit to maturity? Poor savage! And you account it so glorious, do you, to\r\nmutilate and destroy what God himself was more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury in building?\r\n\r\nAnd yet, fellow-Christians, what is the American frigate Macedonian, or\r\nthe English frigate President, but as two bloody red hands painted on\r\nthis poor savage’s blanket?\r\n\r\nAre there no Moravians in the Moon, that not a missionary has yet\r\nvisited this poor pagan planet of ours, to civilise civilisation and\r\nchristianise Christendom?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\nA MAN-OF-WAR RACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe lay in Rio so long—for what reason the Commodore only knows—that a\r\nsaying went abroad among the impatient sailors that our frigate would\r\nat last ground on the beef-bones daily thrown overboard by the cooks.\r\n\r\nBut at last good tidings came. “All hands up anchor, ahoy!” And bright\r\nand early in the morning up came our old iron, as the sun rose in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nThe land-breezes at Rio—by which alone vessels may emerge from the\r\nbay—is ever languid and faint. It comes from gardens of citrons and\r\ncloves, spiced with all the spices of the Tropic of Capricorn. And,\r\nlike that old exquisite, Mohammed, who so much loved to snuff perfumes\r\nand essences, and used to lounge out of the conservatories of Khadija,\r\nhis wife, to give battle to the robust sons of Koriesh; even so this\r\nRio land-breeze comes jaded with sweet-smelling savours, to wrestle\r\nwith the wild Tartar breezes of the sea.\r\n\r\nSlowly we dropped and dropped down the bay, glided like a stately swan\r\nthrough the outlet, and were gradually rolled by the smooth, sliding\r\nbillows broad out upon the deep. Straight in our wake came the tall\r\nmain-mast of the English fighting-frigate, terminating, like a steepled\r\ncathedral, in the bannered cross of the religion of peace; and straight\r\nafter _her_ came the rainbow banner of France, sporting God’s token\r\nthat no more would he make war on the earth.\r\n\r\nBoth Englishmen and Frenchmen were resolved upon a race; and we Yankees\r\nswore by our top-sails and royals to sink their blazing banners that\r\nnight among the Southern constellations we should daily be\r\nextinguishing behind us in our run to the North.\r\n\r\n“Ay,” said Mad Jack, “St. George’s banner shall be as the _Southern\r\nCross_, out of sight, leagues down the horizon, while our gallant\r\nstars, my brave boys, shall burn all alone in the North, like the Great\r\nBear at the Pole! Come on, Rainbow and Cross!”\r\n\r\nBut the wind was long languid and faint, not yet recovered from its\r\nnight’s dissipation ashore, and noon advanced, with the Sugar-Loaf\r\npinnacle in sight.\r\n\r\nNow it is not with ships as with horses; for though, if a horse walk\r\nwell and fast, it generally furnishes good token that he is not bad at\r\na gallop, yet the ship that in a light breeze is outstripped, may sweep\r\nthe stakes, so soon as a t’gallant breeze enables her to strike into a\r\ncanter. Thus fared it with us. First, the Englishman glided ahead, and\r\nbluffly passed on; then the Frenchman politely bade us adieu, while the\r\nold Neversink lingered behind, railing at the effeminate breeze. At one\r\ntime, all three frigates were irregularly abreast, forming a diagonal\r\nline; and so near were all three, that the stately officers on the\r\npoops stiffly saluted by touching their caps, though refraining from\r\nany further civilities. At this juncture, it was a noble sight to\r\nbehold those fine frigates, with dripping breast-hooks, all rearing and\r\nnodding in concert, and to look through their tall spars and wilderness\r\nof rigging, that seemed like inextricably-entangled, gigantic cobwebs\r\nagainst the sky.\r\n\r\nToward sundown the ocean pawed its white hoofs to the spur of its\r\nhelter-skelter rider, a strong blast from the Eastward, and, giving\r\nthree cheers from decks, yards, and tops, we crowded all sail on St.\r\nGeorge and St. Denis.\r\n\r\nBut it is harder to overtake than outstrip; night fell upon us, still\r\nin the rear—still where the little boat was, which, at the eleventh\r\nhour, according to a Rabbinical tradition, pushed after the ark of old\r\nNoah.\r\n\r\nIt was a misty, cloudy night; and though at first our look-outs kept\r\nthe chase in dim sight, yet at last so thick became the atmosphere,\r\nthat no sign of a strange spar was to be seen. But the worst of it was\r\nthat, when last discerned, the Frenchman was broad on our weather-bow,\r\nand the Englishman gallantly leading his van.\r\n\r\nThe breeze blew fresher and fresher; but, with even our main-royal set,\r\nwe dashed along through a cream-coloured ocean of illuminated foam.\r\nWhite-Jacket was then in the top; and it was glorious to look down and\r\nsee our black hull butting the white sea with its broad bows like a\r\nram.\r\n\r\n“We must beat them with such a breeze, dear Jack,” said I to our noble\r\nCaptain of the Top.\r\n\r\n“But the same breeze blows for John Bull, remember,” replied Jack, who,\r\nbeing a Briton, perhaps favoured the Englishman more than the\r\nNeversink.\r\n\r\n“But how we boom through the billows!” cried Jack, gazing over the\r\ntop-rail; then, flinging forth his arm, recited,\r\n\r\n  “‘Aslope, and gliding on the leeward side,\r\n    The bounding vessel cuts the roaring tide.’\r\n\r\n\r\nCamoens! White-Jacket, Camoens! Did you ever read him? The Lusiad, I\r\nmean? It’s the man-of-war epic of the world, my lad. Give me Gama for a\r\nCommodore, say I—Noble Gama! And Mickle, White-Jacket, did you ever\r\nread of him? William Julius Mickle? Camoens’s Translator? A\r\ndisappointed man though, White-Jacket. Besides his version of the\r\nLusiad, he wrote many forgotten things. Did you ever see his ballad of\r\nCumnor Hall?—No?—Why, it gave Sir Walter Scott the hint of Kenilworth.\r\nMy father knew Mickle when he went to sea on board the old Romney\r\nman-of-war. How many great men have been sailors, White-Jacket! They\r\nsay Homer himself was once a tar, even as his hero, Ulysses, was both a\r\nsailor and a shipwright. I’ll swear Shakspeare was once a captain of\r\nthe forecastle. Do you mind the first scene in _The Tempest_,\r\nWhite-Jacket? And the world-finder, Christopher Columbus, was a sailor!\r\nand so was Camoens, who went to sea with Gama, else we had never had\r\nthe Lusiad, White-Jacket. Yes, I’ve sailed over the very track that\r\nCamoens sailed—round the East Cape into the Indian Ocean. I’ve been in\r\nDon Jose’s garden, too, in Macao, and bathed my feet in the blessed dew\r\nof the walks where Camoens wandered before me. Yes, White-Jacket, and I\r\nhave seen and sat in the cave at the end of the flowery, winding way,\r\nwhere Camoens, according to tradition, composed certain parts of his\r\nLusiad. Ay, Camoens was a sailor once! Then, there’s Falconer, whose\r\n‘Ship-wreck’ will never founder, though he himself, poor fellow, was\r\nlost at sea in the Aurora frigate. Old Noah was the first sailor. And\r\nSt. Paul, too, knew how to box the compass, my lad! mind you that\r\nchapter in Acts? I couldn’t spin the yarn better myself. Were you ever\r\nin Malta? They called it Melita in the Apostle’s day. I have been in\r\nPaul’s cave there, White-Jacket. They say a piece of it is good for a\r\ncharm against shipwreck; but I never tried it. There’s Shelley, he was\r\nquite a sailor. Shelley—poor lad! a Percy, too—but they ought to have\r\nlet him sleep in his sailor’s grave—he was drowned in the\r\nMediterranean, you know, near Leghorn—and not burn his body, as they\r\ndid, as if he had been a bloody Turk. But many people thought him so,\r\nWhite-Jacket, because he didn’t go to mass, and because he wrote Queen\r\nMab. Trelawney was by at the burning; and he was an ocean-rover, too!\r\nAy, and Byron helped put a piece of a keel on the fire; for it was made\r\nof bits of a wreck, they say; one wreck burning another! And was not\r\nByron a sailor? an amateur forecastle-man, White-Jacket, so he was;\r\nelse how bid the ocean heave and fall in that grand, majestic way? I\r\nsay, White-Jacket, d’ye mind me? there never was a very great man yet\r\nwho spent all his life inland. A snuff of the sea, my boy, is\r\ninspiration; and having been once out of sight of land, has been the\r\nmaking of many a true poet and the blasting of many pretenders; for,\r\nd’ye see, there’s no gammon about the ocean; it knocks the false keel\r\nright off a pretender’s bows; it tells him just what he is, and makes\r\nhim feel it, too. A sailor’s life, I say, is the thing to bring us\r\nmortals out. What does the blessed Bible say? Don’t it say that we\r\nmain-top-men alone see the marvellous sights and wonders? Don’t deny\r\nthe blessed Bible, now! don’t do it! How it rocks up here, my boy!”\r\nholding on to a shroud; “but it only proves what I’ve been saying—the\r\nsea is the place to cradle genius! Heave and fall, old sea!”\r\n\r\n“And _you_, also, noble Jack,” said I, “what are you but a sailor?”\r\n\r\n“You’re merry, my boy,” said Jack, looking up with a glance like that\r\nof a sentimental archangel doomed to drag out his eternity in disgrace.\r\n“But mind you, White-Jacket, there are many great men in the world\r\nbesides Commodores and Captains. I’ve that here, White-Jacket”—touching\r\nhis forehead—“which, under happier skies—perhaps in you solitary star\r\nthere, peeping down from those clouds—might have made a Homer of me.\r\nBut Fate is Fate, White-Jacket; and we Homers who happen to be captains\r\nof tops must write our odes in our hearts, and publish them in our\r\nheads. But look! the Captain’s on the poop.”\r\n\r\nIt was now midnight; but all the officers were on deck.\r\n\r\n“Jib-boom, there!” cried the Lieutenant of the Watch, going forward and\r\nhailing the headmost look-out. “D’ye see anything of those fellows\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“See nothing, sir.”\r\n\r\n“See nothing, sir,” said the Lieutenant, approaching the Captain, and\r\ntouching his cap.\r\n\r\n“Call all hands!” roared the Captain. “This keel sha’n’t be beat while\r\nI stride it.”\r\n\r\nAll hands were called, and the hammocks stowed in the nettings for the\r\nrest of the night, so that no one could lie between blankets.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to explain the means adopted by the Captain to insure us\r\nthe race, it needs to be said of the Neversink, that, for some years\r\nafter being launched, she was accounted one of the slowest vessels in\r\nthe American Navy. But it chanced upon a time, that, being on a cruise\r\nin the Mediterranean, she happened to sail out of Port Mahon in what\r\nwas then supposed to be very bad trim for the sea. Her bows were\r\nrooting in the water, and her stern kicking up its heels in the air.\r\nBut, wonderful to tell, it was soon discovered that in this comical\r\nposture she sailed like a shooting-star; she outstripped every vessel\r\non the station. Thenceforward all her Captains, on all cruises,\r\n_trimmed her by the head;_ and the Neversink gained the name of a\r\nclipper.\r\n\r\nTo return. All hands being called, they were now made use of by Captain\r\nClaret as make-weights, to trim the ship, scientifically, to her most\r\napproved bearings. Some were sent forward on the spar-deck, with\r\ntwenty-four-pound shot in their hands, and were judiciously scattered\r\nabout here and there, with strict orders not to budge an inch from\r\ntheir stations, for fear of marring the Captain’s plans. Others were\r\ndistributed along the gun and berth-decks, with similar orders; and, to\r\ncrown all, several carronade guns were unshipped from their carriages,\r\nand swung in their breechings from the beams of the main-deck, so as to\r\nimpart a sort of vibratory briskness and oscillating buoyancy to the\r\nfrigate.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we five hundred make-weights stood out that whole night, some\r\nof us exposed to a drenching rain, in order that the Neversink might\r\nnot be beaten. But the comfort and consolation of all make-weights is\r\nas dust in the balance in the estimation of the rulers of our\r\nman-of-war world.\r\n\r\nThe long, anxious night at last came to an end, and, with the first\r\npeep of day, the look-out on the jib-boom was hailed; but nothing was\r\nin sight. At last it was broad day; yet still not a bow was to be seen\r\nin our rear, nor a stern in our van.\r\n\r\n“Where are they?” cried the Captain.\r\n\r\n“Out of sight, astern, to be sure, sir,” said the officer of the deck.\r\n\r\n“Out of sight, _ahead_, to be sure, sir,” muttered Jack Chase, in the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nPrecisely thus stood the question: whether we beat them, or whether\r\nthey beat us, no mortal can tell to this hour, since we never saw them\r\nagain; but for one, White-Jacket will lay his two hands on the bow\r\nchasers of the Neversink, and take his ship’s oath that we Yankees\r\ncarried the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\nFUN IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the race (our man-of-war Derby) we had many days fine weather,\r\nduring which we continued running before the Trades toward the north.\r\nExhilarated by the thought of being homeward-bound, many of the seamen\r\nbecame joyous, and the discipline of the ship, if anything, became a\r\nlittle relaxed. Many pastimes served to while away the _Dog-Watches_ in\r\nparticular. These _Dog-Watches_ (embracing two hours in the early part\r\nof the evening) form the only authorised play-time for the crews of\r\nmost ships at sea.\r\n\r\nAmong other diversions at present licensed by authority in the\r\nNeversink, were those of single-stick, sparring, hammer-and-anvil, and\r\nhead-bumping. All these were under the direct patronage of the Captain,\r\notherwise—seeing the consequences they sometimes led to—they would\r\nundoubtedly have been strictly prohibited. It is a curious coincidence,\r\nthat when a navy captain does not happen to be an admirer of the\r\n_Fistiana_ his crew seldom amuse themselves in that way.\r\n\r\n_Single-stick_, as every one knows, is a delightful pastime, which\r\nconsists in two men standing a few feet apart, and rapping each other\r\nover the head with long poles. There is a good deal of fun in it, so\r\nlong as you are not hit; but a hit—in the judgment of discreet\r\npersons—spoils the sport completely. When this pastime is practiced by\r\nconnoisseurs ashore, they wear heavy, wired helmets, to break the force\r\nof the blows. But the only helmets of our tars were those with which\r\nnature had furnished them. They played with great gun-rammers.\r\n\r\n_Sparring_ consists in playing single-stick with bone poles instead of\r\nwooden ones. Two men stand apart, and pommel each other with their\r\nfists (a hard bunch of knuckles permanently attached to the arms, and\r\nmade globular, or extended into a palm, at the pleasure of the\r\nproprietor), till one of them, finding himself sufficiently thrashed,\r\ncries _enough_.\r\n\r\n_Hammer-and-anvil_ is thus practised by amateurs: Patient No. 1 gets on\r\nall-fours, and stays so; while patient No. 2 is taken up by his arms\r\nand legs, and his base is swung against the base of patient No. 1, till\r\npatient No. 1, with the force of the final blow, is sent flying along\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\n_Head-bumping_, as patronised by Captain Claret, consists in two\r\nnegroes (whites will not answer) butting at each other like rams. This\r\npastime was an especial favourite with the Captain. In the dog-watches,\r\nRose-water and May-day were repeatedly summoned into the lee waist to\r\ntilt at each other, for the benefit of the Captain’s health.\r\n\r\nMay-day was a full-blooded “_bull-negro_,” so the sailors called him,\r\nwith a skull like an iron tea-kettle, wherefore May-day much fancied\r\nthe sport. But Rose-water, he was a slender and rather handsome\r\nmulatto, and abhorred the pastime. Nevertheless, the Captain must be\r\nobeyed; so at the word poor Rose-water was fain to put himself in a\r\nposture of defence, else May-day would incontinently have bumped him\r\nout of a port-hole into the sea. I used to pity poor Rose-water from\r\nthe bottom of my heart. But my pity was almost aroused into indignation\r\nat a sad sequel to one of these gladiatorial scenes.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, lifted up by the unaffected, though verbally unexpressed\r\napplause of the Captain, May-day had begun to despise Rose-water as a\r\npoltroon—a fellow all brains and no skull; whereas he himself was a\r\ngreat warrior, all skull and no brains.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after they had been bumping one evening to the Captain’s\r\ncontent, May-day confidentially told Rose-water that he considered him\r\na “_nigger_,” which, among some blacks, is held a great term of\r\nreproach. Fired at the insult, Rose-water gave May-day to understand\r\nthat he utterly erred; for his mother, a black slave, had been one of\r\nthe mistresses of a Virginia planter belonging to one of the oldest\r\nfamilies in that state. Another insulting remark followed this innocent\r\ndisclosure; retort followed retort; in a word, at last they came\r\ntogether in mortal combat.\r\n\r\nThe master-at-arms caught them in the act, and brought them up to the\r\nmast. The Captain advanced.\r\n\r\n“Please, sir,” said poor Rose-water, “it all came of dat ’ar bumping;\r\nMay-day, here, aggrawated me ’bout it.”\r\n\r\n“Master-at-arms,” said the Captain, “did you see them fighting?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, sir,” said the master-at-arms, touching his cap.\r\n\r\n“Rig the gratings,” said the Captain. “I’ll teach you two men that,\r\nthough I now and then permit you to _play_, I will have no _fighting_.\r\nDo your duty, boatswain’s mate!” And the negroes were flogged.\r\n\r\nJustice commands that the fact of the Captain’s not showing any\r\nleniency to May-day—a decided favourite of his, at least while in the\r\nring—should not be passed over. He flogged both culprits in the most\r\nimpartial manner.\r\n\r\nAs in the matter of the scene at the gangway, shortly after the Cape\r\nHorn theatricals, when my attention had been directed to the fact that\r\nthe officers had _shipped their quarter-deck faces_—upon that occasion,\r\nI say, it was seen with what facility a sea-officer assumes his wonted\r\nseverity of demeanour after a casual relaxation of it. This was\r\nespecially the case with Captain Claret upon the present occasion. For\r\nany landsman to have beheld him in the lee waist, of a pleasant\r\ndog-watch, with a genial, good-humoured countenance, observing the\r\ngladiators in the ring, and now and then indulging in a playful\r\nremark—that landsman would have deemed Captain Claret the indulgent\r\nfather of his crew, perhaps permitting the excess of his\r\nkind-heartedness to encroach upon the appropriate dignity of his\r\nstation. He would have deemed Captain Claret a fine illustration of\r\nthose two well-known poetical comparisons between a sea-captain and a\r\nfather, and between a sea-captain and the master of apprentices,\r\ninstituted by those eminent maritime jurists, the noble Lords Tenterden\r\nand Stowell.\r\n\r\nBut surely, if there is anything hateful, it is this _shipping of the\r\nquarter-deck face_ after wearing a merry and good-natured one. How can\r\nthey have the heart? Methinks, if but once I smiled upon a man—never\r\nmind how much beneath me—I could not bring myself to condemn him to the\r\nshocking misery of the lash. Oh officers! all round the world, if this\r\nquarter-deck face you wear at all, then never unship it for another, to\r\nbe merely sported for a moment. Of all insults, the temporary\r\ncondescension of a master to a slave is the most outrageous and\r\ngalling. That potentate who most condescends, mark him well; for that\r\npotentate, if occasion come, will prove your uttermost tyrant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\nWHITE-JACKET ARRAIGNED AT THE MAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen with five hundred others I made one of the compelled spectators at\r\nthe scourging of poor Rose-water, I little thought what Fate had\r\nordained for myself the next day.\r\n\r\nPoor mulatto! thought I, one of an oppressed race, they degrade you\r\nlike a hound. Thank God! I am a white. Yet I had seen whites also\r\nscourged; for, black or white, all my shipmates were liable to that.\r\nStill, there is something in us, somehow, that in the most degraded\r\ncondition, we snatch at a chance to deceive ourselves into a fancied\r\nsuperiority to others, whom we suppose lower in the scale than\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nPoor Rose-water! thought I; poor mulatto! Heaven send you a release\r\nfrom your humiliation!\r\n\r\nTo make plain the thing about to be related, it needs to repeat what\r\nhas somewhere been previously mentioned, that in _tacking ship_ every\r\nseaman in a man-of-war has a particular station assigned him. What that\r\nstation is, should be made known to him by the First Lieutenant; and\r\nwhen the word is passed to _tack_ or _wear_, it is every seaman’s duty\r\nto be found at his post. But among the various _numbers and stations_\r\ngiven to me by the senior Lieutenant, when I first came on board the\r\nfrigate, he had altogether omitted informing me of my particular place\r\nat those times, and, up to the precise period now written of, I had\r\nhardly known that I should have had any special place then at all. For\r\nthe rest of the men, they seemed to me to catch hold of the first rope\r\nthat offered, as in a merchant-man upon similar occasions. Indeed, I\r\nsubsequently discovered, that such was the state of discipline—in this\r\none particular, at least—that very few of the seamen could tell where\r\ntheir proper stations were, at _tacking or wearing_.\r\n\r\n“All hands tack ship, ahoy!” such was the announcement made by the\r\nboatswain’s mates at the hatchways the morning after the hard fate of\r\nRose-water. It was just eight bells—noon, and springing from my white\r\njacket, which I had spread between the guns for a bed on the main-deck,\r\nI ran up the ladders, and, as usual, seized hold of the main-brace,\r\nwhich fifty hands were streaming along forward. When _main-top-sail\r\nhaul!_ was given through the trumpet, I pulled at this brace with such\r\nheartiness and good-will, that I almost flattered myself that my\r\ninstrumentality in getting the frigate round on the other tack,\r\ndeserved a public vote of thanks, and a silver tankard from Congress.\r\n\r\nBut something happened to be in the way aloft when the yards swung\r\nround; a little confusion ensued; and, with anger on his brow, Captain\r\nClaret came forward to see what occasioned it. No one to let go the\r\nweather-lift of the main-yard! The rope was cast off, however, by a\r\nhand, and the yards unobstructed, came round.\r\n\r\nWhen the last rope was coiled, away, the Captain desired to know of the\r\nFirst Lieutenant who it might be that was stationed at the weather\r\n(then the starboard) main-lift. With a vexed expression of countenance\r\nthe First Lieutenant sent a midshipman for the Station Bill, when, upon\r\nglancing it over, my own name was found put down at the post in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nAt the time I was on the gun-deck below, and did not know of these\r\nproceedings; but a moment after, I heard the boatswain’s mates bawling\r\nmy name at all the hatch-ways, and along all three decks. It was the\r\nfirst time I had ever heard it so sent through the furthest recesses of\r\nthe ship, and well knowing what this generally betokened to other\r\nseamen, my heart jumped to my throat, and I hurriedly asked Flute, the\r\nboatswain’s-mate at the fore-hatchway, what was wanted of me.\r\n\r\n“Captain wants ye at the mast,” he replied. “Going to flog ye, I\r\nguess.”\r\n\r\n“What for?”\r\n\r\n“My eyes! you’ve been chalking your face, hain’t ye?”\r\n\r\n“What am I wanted for?” I repeated.\r\n\r\nBut at that instant my name was again thundered forth by the other\r\nboatswain’s mate, and Flute hurried me away, hinting that I would soon\r\nfind out what the Captain desired of me.\r\n\r\nI swallowed down my heart in me as I touched the spar-deck, for a\r\nsingle instant balanced myself on my best centre, and then, wholly\r\nignorant of what was going to be alleged against me, advanced to the\r\ndread tribunal of the frigate.\r\n\r\nAs I passed through the gangway, I saw the quarter-master rigging the\r\ngratings; the boatswain with his green bag of scourges; the\r\nmaster-at-arms ready to help off some one’s shirt.\r\n\r\nAgain I made a desperate swallow of my whole soul in me, and found\r\nmyself standing before Captain Claret. His flushed face obviously\r\nshowed him in ill-humour. Among the group of officers by his side was\r\nthe First Lieutenant, who, as I came aft, eyed me in such a manner,\r\nthat I plainly perceived him to be extremely vexed at me for having\r\nbeen the innocent means of reflecting upon the manner in which he kept\r\nup the discipline of the ship.\r\n\r\n“Why were you not at your station, sir?” asked the Captain.\r\n\r\n“What station do you mean, sir?” said I.\r\n\r\nIt is generally the custom with man-of-war’s-men to stand obsequiously\r\ntouching their hat at every sentence they address to the Captain. But\r\nas this was not obligatory upon me by the Articles of War, I did not do\r\nso upon the present occasion, and previously, I had never had the\r\ndangerous honour of a personal interview with Captain Claret.\r\n\r\nHe quickly noticed my omission of the homage usually rendered him, and\r\ninstinct told me, that to a certain extent, it set his heart against\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“What station, sir, do you mean?” said I.\r\n\r\n“You pretend ignorance,” he replied; “it will not help you, sir.”\r\n\r\nGlancing at the Captain, the First Lieutenant now produced the Station\r\nBill, and read my name in connection with that of the starboard\r\nmain-lift.\r\n\r\n“Captain Claret,” said I, “it is the first time I ever heard of my\r\nbeing assigned to that post.”\r\n\r\n“How is this, Mr. Bridewell?” he said, turning to the First Lieutenant,\r\nwith a fault-finding expression.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible, sir,” said that officer, striving to hide his\r\nvexation, “but this man must have known his station.”\r\n\r\n“I have never known it before this moment, Captain Claret,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Do you contradict my officer?” he returned. “I shall flog you.”\r\n\r\nI had now been on board the frigate upward of a year, and remained\r\nunscourged; the ship was homeward-bound, and in a few weeks, at most, I\r\nwould be a free man. And now, after making a hermit of myself in some\r\nthings, in order to avoid the possibility of the scourge, here it was\r\nhanging over me for a thing utterly unforeseen, for a crime of which I\r\nwas as utterly innocent. But all that was as naught. I saw that my case\r\nwas hopeless; my solemn disclaimer was thrown in my teeth, and the\r\nboatswain’s mate stood curling his fingers through the _cat_.\r\n\r\nThere are times when wild thoughts enter a man’s heart, when he seems\r\nalmost irresponsible for his act and his deed. The Captain stood on the\r\nweather-side of the deck. Sideways, on an unobstructed line with him,\r\nwas the opening of the lee-gangway, where the side-ladders are\r\nsuspended in port. Nothing but a slight bit of sinnate-stuff served to\r\nrail in this opening, which was cut right down to the level of the\r\nCaptain’s feet, showing the far sea beyond. I stood a little to\r\nwindward of him, and, though he was a large, powerful man, it was\r\ncertain that a sudden rush against him, along the slanting deck, would\r\ninfallibly pitch him headforemost into the ocean, though he who so\r\nrushed must needs go over with him. My blood seemed clotting in my\r\nveins; I felt icy cold at the tips of my fingers, and a dimness was\r\nbefore my eyes. But through that dimness the boatswain’s mate, scourge\r\nin hand, loomed like a giant, and Captain Claret, and the blue sea seen\r\nthrough the opening at the gangway, showed with an awful vividness. I\r\ncannot analyse my heart, though it then stood still within me. But the\r\nthing that swayed me to my purpose was not altogether the thought that\r\nCaptain Claret was about to degrade me, and that I had taken an oath\r\nwith my soul that he should not. No, I felt my man’s manhood so\r\nbottomless within me, that no word, no blow, no scourge of Captain\r\nClaret could cut me deep enough for that. I but swung to an instinct in\r\nme—the instinct diffused through all animated nature, the same that\r\nprompts even a worm to turn under the heel. Locking souls-with him, I\r\nmeant to drag Captain Claret from this earthly tribunal of his to that\r\nof Jehovah and let Him decide between us. No other way could I escape\r\nthe scourge.\r\n\r\nNature has not implanted any power in man that was not meant to be\r\nexercised at times, though too often our powers have been abused. The\r\nprivilege, inborn and inalienable, that every man has of dying himself,\r\nand inflicting death upon another, was not given to us without a\r\npurpose. These are the last resources of an insulted and unendurable\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n“To the gratings, sir!” said Captain Claret; “do you hear?”\r\n\r\nMy eye was measuring the distance between him and the sea.\r\n\r\n“Captain Claret,” said a voice advancing from the crowd. I turned to\r\nsee who this might be, that audaciously interposed at a juncture like\r\nthis. It was the same remarkably handsome and gentlemanly corporal of\r\nmarines, Colbrook, who has been previously alluded to, in the chapter\r\ndescribing killing time in a man-of-war.\r\n\r\n“I know that man,” said Colbrook, touching his cap, and speaking in a\r\nmild, firm, but extremely deferential manner; “and I know that he would\r\nnot be found absent from his station, if he knew where it was.”\r\n\r\nThis speech was almost unprecedented. Seldom or never before had a\r\nmarine dared to speak to the Captain of a frigate in behalf of a seaman\r\nat the mast. But there was something so unostentatiously commanding in\r\nthe calm manner of the man, that the Captain, though astounded, did not\r\nin any way reprimand him. The very unusualness of his interference\r\nseemed Colbrook’s protection.\r\n\r\nTaking heart, perhaps, from Colbrook’s example, Jack Chase interposed,\r\nand in a manly but carefully respectful manner, in substance repeated\r\nthe corporal’s remark, adding that he had never found me wanting in the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nThe Captain looked from Chase to Colbrook, and from Colbrook to\r\nChase—one the foremost man among the seamen, the other the foremost man\r\namong the soldiers—then all round upon the packed and silent crew, and,\r\nas if a slave to Fate, though supreme Captain of a frigate, he turned\r\nto the First Lieutenant, made some indifferent remark, and saying to me\r\n_you may go_, sauntered aft into his cabin; while I, who, in the\r\ndesperation of my soul, had but just escaped being a murderer and a\r\nsuicide, almost burst into tears of thanks-giving where I stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\nA MAN-OF-WAR FOUNTAIN, AND OTHER THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us forget the scourge and the gangway a while, and jot down in our\r\nmemories a few little things pertaining to our man-of-war world. I let\r\nnothing slip, however small; and feel myself actuated by the same\r\nmotive which has prompted many worthy old chroniclers, to set down the\r\nmerest trifles concerning things that are destined to pass away\r\nentirely from the earth, and which, if not preserved in the nick of\r\ntime, must infallibly perish from the memories of man. Who knows that\r\nthis humble narrative may not hereafter prove the history of an\r\nobsolete barbarism? Who knows that, when men-of-war shall be no more,\r\n“White-Jacket” may not be quoted to show to the people in the\r\nMillennium what a man-of-war was? God hasten the time! Lo! ye years,\r\nescort it hither, and bless our eyes ere we die.\r\n\r\nThere is no part of a frigate where you will see more going and coming\r\nof strangers, and overhear more greetings and gossipings of\r\nacquaintances, than in the immediate vicinity of the scuttle-butt, just\r\nforward of the main-hatchway, on the gun-deck.\r\n\r\nThe scuttle-butt is a goodly, round, painted cask, standing on end, and\r\nwith its upper head removed, showing a narrow, circular shelf within,\r\nwhere rest a number of tin cups for the accommodation of drinkers.\r\nCentral, within the scuttle-butt itself, stands an iron pump, which,\r\nconnecting with the immense water-tanks in the hold, furnishes an\r\nunfailing supply of the much-admired Pale Ale, first brewed in the\r\nbrooks of the garden of Eden, and stamped with the _brand_ of our old\r\nfather Adam, who never knew what wine was. We are indebted to the old\r\nvintner Noah for that. The scuttle-butt is the only fountain in the\r\nship; and here alone can you drink, unless at your meals. Night and day\r\nan armed sentry paces before it, bayonet in hand, to see that no water\r\nis taken away, except according to law. I wonder that they station no\r\nsentries at the port-holes, to see that no air is breathed, except\r\naccording to Navy regulations.\r\n\r\nAs five hundred men come to drink at this scuttle-butt; as it is often\r\nsurrounded by officers’ servants drawing water for their masters to\r\nwash; by the cooks of the range, who hither come to fill their\r\ncoffee-pots; and by the cooks of the ship’s messes to procure water for\r\ntheir _duffs_; the scuttle-butt may be denominated the town-pump of the\r\nship. And would that my fine countryman, Hawthorne of Salem, had but\r\nserved on board a man-of-war in his time, that he might give us the\r\nreading of a “_rill_” from the scuttle-butt.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in all extensive establishments—abbeys, arsenals, colleges,\r\ntreasuries, metropolitan post-offices, and monasteries—there are many\r\nsnug little niches, wherein are ensconced certain superannuated old\r\npensioner officials; and, more especially, as in most ecclesiastical\r\nestablishments, a few choice prebendary stalls are to be found,\r\nfurnished with well-filled mangers and racks; so, in a man-of-war,\r\nthere are a variety of similar snuggeries for the benefit of decrepit\r\nor rheumatic old tars. Chief among these is the office of _mast-man_.\r\n\r\nThere is a stout rail on deck, at the base of each mast, where a number\r\nof _braces, lifts_, and _buntlines_ are belayed to the pins. It is the\r\nsole duty of the mast-man to see that these ropes are always kept\r\nclear, to preserve his premises in a state of the greatest attainable\r\nneatness, and every Sunday morning to dispose his ropes in neat\r\n_Flemish coils_.\r\n\r\nThe _main-mast-man_ of the Neversink was a very aged seaman, who well\r\ndeserved his comfortable berth. He had seen more than half a century of\r\nthe most active service, and, through all, had proved himself a good\r\nand faithful man. He furnished one of the very rare examples of a\r\nsailor in a green old age; for, with most sailors, old age comes in\r\nyouth, and Hardship and Vice carry them on an early bier to the grave.\r\n\r\nAs in the evening of life, and at the close of the day, old Abraham sat\r\nat the door of his tent, biding his time to die, so sits our old\r\nmast-man on the _coat of the mast_, glancing round him with patriarchal\r\nbenignity. And that mild expression of his sets off very strangely a\r\nface that has been burned almost black by the torrid suns that shone\r\nfifty years ago—a face that is seamed with three sabre cuts. You would\r\nalmost think this old mast-man had been blown out of Vesuvius, to look\r\nalone at his scarred, blackened forehead, chin, and cheeks. But gaze\r\ndown into his eye, and though all the snows of Time have drifted higher\r\nand higher upon his brow, yet deep down in that eye you behold an\r\ninfantile, sinless look, the same that answered the glance of this old\r\nman’s mother when first she cried for the babe to be laid by her side.\r\nThat look is the fadeless, ever infantile immortality within.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lord Nelsons of the sea, though but Barons in the state, yet\r\noftentimes prove more potent than their royal masters; and at such\r\nscenes as Trafalgar—dethroning this Emperor and reinstating that—enact\r\non the ocean the proud part of mighty Richard Neville, the king-making\r\nEarl of the land. And as Richard Neville entrenched himself in his\r\nmoated old man-of-war castle of Warwick, which, underground, was\r\ntraversed with vaults, hewn out of the solid rock, and intricate as the\r\nwards of the old keys of Calais surrendered to Edward III.; even so do\r\nthese King-Commodores house themselves in their water-rimmed,\r\ncannon-sentried frigates, oaken dug, deck under deck, as cell under\r\ncell. And as the old Middle-Age warders of Warwick, every night at\r\ncurfew, patrolled the battlements, and dove down into the vaults to see\r\nthat all lights were extinguished, even so do the master-at-arms and\r\nship’s corporals of a frigate perambulate all the decks of a\r\nman-of-war, blowing out all tapers but those burning in the legalized\r\nbattle-lanterns. Yea, in these things, so potent is the authority of\r\nthese sea-wardens, that, though almost the lowest subalterns in the\r\nship, yet should they find the Senior Lieutenant himself sitting up\r\nlate in his state-room, reading Bowditch’s Navigator, or D’Anton “_On\r\nGunpowder and Fire-arms_,” they would infallibly blow the light out\r\nunder his very nose; nor durst that Grand-Vizier resent the indignity.\r\n\r\nBut, unwittingly, I have ennobled, by grand historical comparisons,\r\nthis prying, pettifogging, Irish-informer of a master-at-arms.\r\n\r\nYou have seen some slim, slip-shod housekeeper, at midnight ferreting\r\nover a rambling old house in the country, startling at fancied witches\r\nand ghosts, yet intent on seeing every door bolted, every smouldering\r\nember in the fireplaces smothered, every loitering domestic abed, and\r\nevery light made dark. This is the master-at-arms taking his\r\nnight-rounds in a frigate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that but little is seen of the Commodore in these\r\nchapters, and that, since he so seldom appears on the stage, he cannot\r\nbe so august a personage, after all. But the mightiest potentates keep\r\nthe most behind the veil. You might tarry in Constantinople a month,\r\nand never catch a glimpse of the Sultan. The grand Lama of Thibet,\r\naccording to some accounts, is never beheld by the people. But if any\r\none doubts the majesty of a Commodore, let him know that, according to\r\nXLII. of the Articles of War, he is invested with a prerogative which,\r\naccording to monarchical jurists, is inseparable from the throne—the\r\nplenary pardoning power. He may pardon all offences committed in the\r\nsquadron under his command.\r\n\r\nBut this prerogative is only his while at sea, or on a foreign station.\r\nA circumstance peculiarly significant of the great difference between\r\nthe stately absolutism of a Commodore enthroned on his poop in a\r\nforeign harbour, and an unlaced Commodore negligently reclining in an\r\neasy-chair in the bosom of his family at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\nPRAYERS AT THE GUNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe training-days, or general quarters, now and then taking place in\r\nour frigate, have already been described, also the Sunday devotions on\r\nthe half-deck; but nothing has yet been said concerning the daily\r\nmorning and evening quarters, when the men silently stand at their\r\nguns, and the chaplain simply offers up a prayer.\r\n\r\nLet us now enlarge upon this matter. We have plenty of time; the\r\noccasion invites; for behold! the homeward-bound Neversink bowls along\r\nover a jubilant sea.\r\n\r\nShortly after breakfast the drum beats to quarters; and among five\r\nhundred men, scattered over all three decks, and engaged in all manner\r\nof ways, that sudden rolling march is magical as the monitory sound to\r\nwhich every good Mussulman at sunset drops to the ground whatsoever his\r\nhands might have found to do, and, throughout all Turkey, the people in\r\nconcert kneel toward their holy Mecca.\r\n\r\nThe sailors run to and fro-some up the deck-ladders, some down—to gain\r\ntheir respective stations in the shortest possible time. In three\r\nminutes all is composed. One by one, the various officers stationed\r\nover the separate divisions of the ship then approach the First\r\nLieutenant on the quarter-deck, and report their respective men at\r\ntheir quarters. It is curious to watch their countenances at this time.\r\nA profound silence prevails; and, emerging through the hatchway, from\r\none of the lower decks, a slender young officer appears, hugging his\r\nsword to his thigh, and advances through the long lanes of sailors at\r\ntheir guns, his serious eye all the time fixed upon the First\r\nLieutenant’s—his polar star. Sometimes he essays a stately and\r\ngraduated step, an erect and martial bearing, and seems full of the\r\nvast national importance of what he is about to communicate.\r\n\r\nBut when at last he gains his destination, you are amazed to perceive\r\nthat all he has to say is imparted by a Freemason touch of his cap, and\r\na bow. He then turns and makes off to his division, perhaps passing\r\nseveral brother Lieutenants, all bound on the same errand he himself\r\nhas just achieved. For about five minutes these officers are coming and\r\ngoing, bringing in thrilling intelligence from all quarters of the\r\nfrigate; most stoically received, however, by the First Lieutenant.\r\nWith his legs apart, so as to give a broad foundation for the\r\nsuperstructure of his dignity, this gentleman stands stiff as a\r\npike-staff on the quarter-deck. One hand holds his sabre—an\r\nappurtenance altogether unnecessary at the time; and which he\r\naccordingly tucks, point backward, under his arm, like an umbrella on a\r\nsun-shiny day. The other hand is continually bobbing up and down to the\r\nleather front of his cap, in response to the reports and salute of his\r\nsubordinates, to whom he never deigns to vouchsafe a syllable, merely\r\ngoing through the motions of accepting their news, without bestowing\r\nthanks for their pains.\r\n\r\nThis continual touching of caps between officers on board a man-of-war\r\nis the reason why you invariably notice that the glazed fronts of their\r\ncaps look jaded, lack-lustre, and worn; sometimes slightly\r\noleaginous—though, in other respects, the cap may appear glossy and\r\nfresh. But as for the First Lieutenant, he ought to have extra pay\r\nallowed to him, on account of his extraordinary outlays in cap fronts;\r\nfor he it is to whom, all day long, reports of various kinds are\r\nincessantly being made by the junior Lieutenants; and no report is made\r\nby them, however trivial, but caps are touched on the occasion. It is\r\nobvious that these individual salutes must be greatly multiplied and\r\naggregated upon the senior Lieutenant, who must return them all.\r\nIndeed, when a subordinate officer is first promoted to that rank, he\r\ngenerally complains of the same exhaustion about the shoulder and elbow\r\nthat La Fayette mourned over, when, in visiting America, he did little\r\nelse but shake the sturdy hands of patriotic farmers from sunrise to\r\nsunset.\r\n\r\nThe various officers of divisions having presented their respects, and\r\nmade good their return to their stations, the First Lieutenant turns\r\nround, and, marching aft, endeavours to catch the eye of the Captain,\r\nin order to touch his own cap to that personage, and thereby, without\r\nadding a word of explanation, communicate the fact of all hands being\r\nat their gun’s. He is a sort of retort, or receiver-general, to\r\nconcentrate the whole sum of the information imparted to him, and\r\ndischarge it upon his superior at one touch of his cap front.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the Captain feels out of sorts, or in ill-humour, or is\r\npleased to be somewhat capricious, or has a fancy to show a touch of\r\nhis omnipotent supremacy; or, peradventure, it has so happened that the\r\nFirst Lieutenant has, in some way, piqued or offended him, and he is\r\nnot unwilling to show a slight specimen of his dominion over him, even\r\nbefore the eyes of all hands; at all events, only by some one of these\r\nsuppositions can the singular circumstance be accounted for, that\r\nfrequently Captain Claret would pertinaciously promenade up and down\r\nthe poop, purposely averting his eye from the First Lieutenant, who\r\nwould stand below in the most awkward suspense, waiting the first wink\r\nfrom his superior’s eye.\r\n\r\n“Now I have him!” he must have said to himself, as the Captain would\r\nturn toward him in his walk; “now’s my time!” and up would go his hand\r\nto his cap; but, alas! the Captain was off again; and the men at the\r\nguns would cast sly winks at each other as the embarrassed Lieutenant\r\nwould bite his lips with suppressed vexation.\r\n\r\nUpon some occasions this scene would be repeated several times, till at\r\nlast Captain Claret, thinking, that in the eyes of all hands, his\r\ndignity must by this time be pretty well bolstered, would stalk towards\r\nhis subordinate, looking him full in the eyes; whereupon up goes his\r\nhand to the cap front, and the Captain, nodding his acceptance of the\r\nreport, descends from his perch to the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\nBy this time the stately Commodore slowly emerges from his cabin, and\r\nsoon stands leaning alone against the brass rails of the\r\nafter-hatchway. In passing him, the Captain makes a profound\r\nsalutation, which his superior returns, in token that the Captain is at\r\nperfect liberty to proceed with the ceremonies of the hour.\r\n\r\nMarching on, Captain Claret at last halts near the main-mast, at the\r\nhead of a group of the ward-room officers, and by the side of the\r\nChaplain. At a sign from his finger, the brass band strikes up the\r\nPortuguese hymn. This over, from Commodore to hammock-boy, all hands\r\nuncover, and the Chaplain reads a prayer. Upon its conclusion, the drum\r\nbeats the retreat, and the ship’s company disappear from the guns. At\r\nsea or in harbour, this ceremony is repeated every morning and evening.\r\n\r\nBy those stationed on the quarter-deck the Chaplain is distinctly\r\nheard; but the quarter-deck gun division embraces but a tenth part of\r\nthe ship’s company, many of whom are below, on the main-deck, where not\r\none syllable of the prayer can be heard. This seemed a great\r\nmisfortune; for I well knew myself how blessed and soothing it was to\r\nmingle twice every day in these peaceful devotions, and, with the\r\nCommodore, and Captain, and smallest boy, unite in acknowledging\r\nAlmighty God. There was also a touch of the temporary equality of the\r\nChurch about it, exceedingly grateful to a man-of-war’s-man like me.\r\n\r\nMy carronade-gun happened to be directly opposite the brass railing\r\nagainst which the Commodore invariably leaned at prayers. Brought so\r\nclose together, twice every day, for more than a year, we could not but\r\nbecome intimately acquainted with each other’s faces. To this fortunate\r\ncircumstance it is to be ascribed, that some time after reaching home,\r\nwe were able to recognise each other when we chanced to meet in\r\nWashington, at a ball given by the Russian Minister, the Baron de\r\nBodisco. And though, while on board the frigate, the Commodore never in\r\nany manner personally addressed me—nor did I him—yet, at the Minister’s\r\nsocial entertainment, we _there_ became exceedingly chatty; nor did I\r\nfail to observe, among that crowd of foreign dignitaries and magnates\r\nfrom all parts of America, that my worthy friend did not appear so\r\nexalted as when leaning, in solitary state, against the brass railing\r\nof the Neversink’s quarter-deck. Like many other gentlemen, he appeared\r\nto the best advantage, and was treated with the most deference in the\r\nbosom of his home, the frigate.\r\n\r\nOur morning and evening quarters were agreeably diversified for some\r\nweeks by a little circumstance, which to some of us at least, always\r\nseemed very pleasing.\r\n\r\nAt Callao, half of the Commodore’s cabin had been hospitably yielded to\r\nthe family of a certain aristocratic-looking magnate, who was going\r\nambassador from Peru to the Court of the Brazils, at Rio. This\r\ndignified diplomatist sported a long, twirling mustache, that almost\r\nenveloped his mouth. The sailors said he looked like a rat with his\r\nteeth through a bunch of oakum, or a St. Jago monkey peeping through a\r\nprickly-pear bush.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied by a very beautiful wife, and a still more beautiful\r\nlittle daughter, about six years old. Between this dark-eyed little\r\ngipsy and our chaplain there soon sprung up a cordial love and good\r\nfeeling, so much so, that they were seldom apart. And whenever the drum\r\nbeat to quarters, and the sailors were hurrying to their stations, this\r\nlittle signorita would outrun them all to gain her own quarters at the\r\ncapstan, where she would stand by the chaplain’s side, grasping his\r\nhand, and looking up archly in his face.\r\n\r\nIt was a sweet relief from the domineering sternness of our martial\r\ndiscipline—a sternness not relaxed even at our devotions before the\r\naltar of the common God of commodore and cabin-boy—to see that lovely\r\nlittle girl standing among the thirty-two pounders, and now and then\r\ncasting a wondering, commiserating glance at the array of grim seamen\r\naround her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\nMONTHLY MUSTER ROUND THE CAPSTAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides general quarters, and the regular morning and evening quarters\r\nfor prayers on board the Neversink, on the first Sunday of every month\r\nwe had a grand “_muster round the capstan_,” when we passed in solemn\r\nreview before the Captain and officers, who closely scanned our frocks\r\nand trowsers, to see whether they were according to the Navy cut. In\r\nsome ships, every man is required to bring his bag and hammock along\r\nfor inspection.\r\n\r\nThis ceremony acquires its chief solemnity, and, to a novice, is\r\nrendered even terrible, by the reading of the Articles of War by the\r\nCaptain’s clerk before the assembled ship’s company, who in testimony\r\nof their enforced reverence for the code, stand bareheaded till the\r\nlast sentence is pronounced.\r\n\r\nTo a mere amateur reader the quiet perusal of these Articles of War\r\nwould be attended with some nervous emotions. Imagine, then, what _my_\r\nfeelings must have been, when, with my hat deferentially in my hand, I\r\nstood before my lord and master, Captain Claret, and heard these\r\nArticles read as the law and gospel, the infallible, unappealable\r\ndispensation and code, whereby I lived, and moved, and had my being on\r\nboard of the United States ship Neversink.\r\n\r\nOf some twenty offences—made penal—that a seaman may commit, and which\r\nare specified in this code, thirteen are punishable by death.\r\n\r\n“_Shall suffer death!_” This was the burden of nearly every Article\r\nread by the Captain’s clerk; for he seemed to have been instructed to\r\nomit the longer Articles, and only present those which were brief and\r\nto the point.\r\n\r\n“_Shall suffer death!_” The repeated announcement falls on your ear\r\nlike the intermitting discharge of artillery. After it has been\r\nrepeated again and again, you listen to the reader as he deliberately\r\nbegins a new paragraph; you hear him reciting the involved, but\r\ncomprehensive and clear arrangement of the sentence, detailing all\r\npossible particulars of the offence described, and you breathlessly\r\nawait, whether _that_ clause also is going to be concluded by the\r\ndischarge of the terrible minute-gun. When, lo! it again booms on your\r\near—_shall suffer death!_ No reservations, no contingencies; not the\r\nremotest promise of pardon or reprieve; not a glimpse of commutation of\r\nthe sentence; all hope and consolation is shut out—_shall suffer\r\ndeath!_ that is the simple fact for you to digest; and it is a tougher\r\nmorsel, believe White-Jacket when he says it, than a forty-two-pound\r\ncannon-ball.\r\n\r\nBut there is a glimmering of an alternative to the sailor who infringes\r\nthese Articles. Some of them thus terminates: “_Shall suffer death, or\r\nsuch punishment as a court-martial shall adjudge_.” But hints this at a\r\npenalty still more serious? Perhaps it means “_death, or worse\r\npunishment_.”\r\n\r\nYour honours of the Spanish Inquisition, Loyola and Torquemada!\r\nproduce, reverend gentlemen, your most secret code, and match these\r\nArticles of War, if you can. Jack Ketch, _you_ also are experienced in\r\nthese things! Thou most benevolent of mortals, who standest by us, and\r\nhangest round our necks, when all the rest of this world are against\r\nus—tell us, hangman, what punishment is this, horribly hinted at as\r\nbeing worse than death? Is it, upon an empty stomach, to read the\r\nArticles of War every morning, for the term of one’s natural life? Or\r\nis it to be imprisoned in a cell, with its walls papered from floor to\r\nceiling with printed copies, in italics, of these Articles of War?\r\n\r\nBut it needs not to dilate upon the pure, bubbling milk of human\r\nkindness, and Christian charity, and forgiveness of injuries which\r\npervade this charming document, so thoroughly imbued, as a Christian\r\ncode, with the benignant spirit of the Sermon on the Mount. But as it\r\nis very nearly alike in the foremost states of Christendom, and as it\r\nis nationally set forth by those states, it indirectly becomes an index\r\nto the true condition of the present civilization of the world.\r\n\r\nAs, month after month, I would stand bareheaded among my shipmates, and\r\nhear this document read, I have thought to myself, Well, well,\r\nWhite-Jacket, you are in a sad box, indeed. But prick your ears, there\r\ngoes another minute-gun. It admonishes you to take all bad usage in\r\ngood part, and never to join in any public meeting that may be held on\r\nthe gun-deck for a redress of grievances. Listen:\r\n\r\nArt. XIII. “If any person in the navy shall make, or attempt to make,\r\nany mutinous assembly, he shall, on conviction thereof by a court\r\nmartial, suffer death.”\r\n\r\nBless me, White-Jacket, are you a great gun yourself, that you so\r\nrecoil, to the extremity of your breechings, at that discharge?\r\n\r\nBut give ear again. Here goes another minute-gun. It indirectly\r\nadmonishes you to receive the grossest insult, and stand still under\r\nit:\r\n\r\nArt. XIV. “No private in the navy shall disobey the lawful orders of\r\nhis superior officer, or strike him, or draw, or offer to draw, or\r\nraise any weapon against him, while in the execution of the duties of\r\nhis office, on pain of death.”\r\n\r\nDo not hang back there by the bulwarks, White-Jacket; come up to the\r\nmark once more; for here goes still another minute-gun, which\r\nadmonishes you never to be caught napping:\r\n\r\nPart of Art. XX. “If any person in the navy shall sleep upon his watch,\r\nhe shall suffer death.”\r\n\r\nMurderous! But then, in time of peace, they do not enforce these\r\nblood-thirsty laws? Do they not, indeed? What happened to those three\r\nsailors on board an American armed vessel a few years ago, quite within\r\nyour memory, White-Jacket; yea, while you yourself were yet serving on\r\nboard this very frigate, the Neversink? What happened to those three\r\nAmericans, White-Jacket—those three sailors, even as you, who once were\r\nalive, but now are dead? “_Shall suffer death!_” those were the three\r\nwords that hung those three sailors.\r\n\r\nHave a care, then, have a care, lest you come to a sad end, even the\r\nend of a rope; lest, with a black-and-blue throat, you turn a dumb\r\ndiver after pearl-shells; put to bed for ever, and tucked in, in your\r\nown hammock, at the bottom of the sea. And there you will lie,\r\nWhite-Jacket, while hostile navies are playing cannon-ball billiards\r\nover your grave.\r\n\r\nBy the main-mast! then, in a time of profound peace, I am subject to\r\nthe cut-throat martial law. And when my own brother, who happens to be\r\ndwelling ashore, and does not serve his country as I am now doing—when\r\n_he_ is at liberty to call personally upon the President of the United\r\nStates, and express his disapprobation of the whole national\r\nadministration, here am I, liable at any time to be run up at the\r\nyard-arm, with a necklace, made by no jeweler, round my neck!\r\n\r\nA hard case, truly, White-Jacket; but it cannot be helped. Yes; you\r\nlive under this same martial law. Does not everything around you din\r\nthe fact in your ears? Twice every day do you not jump to your quarters\r\nat the sound of a drum? Every morning, in port, are you not roused from\r\nyour hammock by the _reveille_, and sent to it again at nightfall by\r\nthe _tattoo?_ Every Sunday are you not commanded in the mere matter of\r\nthe very dress you shall wear through that blessed day? Can your\r\nshipmates so much as drink their “tot of grog?” nay, can they even\r\ndrink but a cup of water at the scuttle-butt, without an armed sentry\r\nstanding over them? Does not every officer wear a sword instead of a\r\ncane? You live and move among twenty-four-pounders. White-Jacket; the\r\nvery cannon-balls are deemed an ornament around you, serving to\r\nembellish the hatchways; and should you come to die at sea,\r\nWhite-Jacket, still two cannon-balls would bear you company when you\r\nwould be committed to the deep. Yea, by all methods, and devices, and\r\ninventions, you are momentarily admonished of the fact that you live\r\nunder the Articles of War. And by virtue of them it is, White-Jacket,\r\nthat, without a hearing and without a trial, you may, at a wink from\r\nthe Captain, be condemned to the scourge.\r\n\r\nSpeak you true? Then let me fly!\r\n\r\nNay, White-Jacket, the landless horizon hoops you in.\r\n\r\nSome tempest, then, surge all the sea against us! hidden reefs and\r\nrocks, arise and dash the ships to chips! I was not born a serf, and\r\nwill not live a slave! Quick! cork-screw whirlpools, suck us down!\r\nworld’s end whelm us!\r\n\r\nNay, White-Jacket, though this frigate laid her broken bones upon the\r\nAntarctic shores of Palmer’s Land; though not two planks adhered;\r\nthough all her guns were spiked by sword-fish blades, and at her\r\nyawning hatchways mouth-yawning sharks swam in and out; yet, should you\r\nescape the wreck and scramble to the beach, this Martial Law would meet\r\nyou still, and snatch you by the throat. Hark!\r\n\r\nArt. XLII. Part of Sec. 3.-“In all cases where the crews of the ships\r\nor vessels of the United States shall be separated from their vessels\r\nby the latter being wrecked, lost, or destroyed, all the command,\r\npower, and authority given to the officers of such ships or vessels\r\nshall remain, and be in full force, as effectually as if such ship or\r\nvessel were not so wrecked, lost or destroyed.”\r\n\r\nHear you that, White-Jacket! I tell you there is no escape. Afloat or\r\nwrecked the Martial Law relaxes not its gripe. And though, by that\r\nself-same warrant, for some offence therein set down, you were indeed\r\nto “suffer death,” even then the Martial Law might hunt you straight\r\nthrough the other world, and out again at its other end, following you\r\nthrough all eternity, like an endless thread on the inevitable track of\r\nits own point, passing unnumbered needles through.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\nTHE GENEALOGY OF THE ARTICLES OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Articles of War form the ark and constitution of the penal laws\r\nof the American Navy, in all sobriety and earnestness it may be well to\r\nglance at their origin. Whence came they? And how is it that one arm of\r\nthe national defences of a Republic comes to be ruled by a Turkish\r\ncode, whose every section almost, like each of the tubes of a revolving\r\npistol, fires nothing short of death into the heart of an offender? How\r\ncomes it that, by virtue of a law solemnly ratified by a Congress of\r\nfreemen, the representatives of freemen, thousands of Americans are\r\nsubjected to the most despotic usages, and, from the dockyards of a\r\nrepublic, absolute monarchies are launched, with the “glorious stars\r\nand stripes” for an ensign? By what unparalleled anomaly, by what\r\nmonstrous grafting of tyranny upon freedom did these Articles of War\r\never come to be so much as heard of in the American Navy?\r\n\r\nWhence came they? They cannot be the indigenous growth of those\r\npolitical institutions, which are based upon that arch-democrat Thomas\r\nJefferson’s Declaration of Independence? No; they are an importation\r\nfrom abroad, even from Britain, whose laws we Americans hurled off as\r\ntyrannical, and yet retained the most tyrannical of all.\r\n\r\nBut we stop not here; for these Articles of War had their congenial\r\norigin in a period of the history of Britain when the Puritan Republic\r\nhad yielded to a monarchy restored; when a hangman Judge Jeffreys\r\nsentenced a world’s champion like Algernon Sidney to the block; when\r\none of a race by some deemed accursed of God—even a Stuart, was on the\r\nthrone; and a Stuart, also, was at the head of the Navy, as Lord High\r\nAdmiral. One, the son of a King beheaded for encroachments upon the\r\nrights of his people, and the other, his own brother, afterward a king,\r\nJames II., who was hurled from the throne for his tyranny. This is the\r\norigin of the Articles of War; and it carries with it an unmistakable\r\nclew to their despotism.[4]\r\n\r\n [4] The first Naval Articles of War in the English language were\r\n passed in the thirteenth year of the reign of Charles the Second,\r\n under the title of “_An act for establishing Articles and Orders for\r\n the regulating and better Government of his Majesty’s Navies,\r\n Ships-of-War, and Forces by Sea_.” This act was repealed, and, so far\r\n as concerned the officers, a modification of it substituted, in the\r\n twenty-second year of the reign of George the Second, shortly after\r\n the Peace of Aix la Chapelle, just one century ago. This last act, it\r\n is believed, comprises, in substance, the Articles of War at this day\r\n in force in the British Navy. It is not a little curious, nor without\r\n meaning, that neither of these acts explicitly empowers an officer to\r\n inflict the lash. It would almost seem as if, in this case, the\r\n British lawgivers were willing to leave such a stigma out of an\r\n organic statute, and bestow the power of the lash in some less solemn,\r\n and perhaps less public manner. Indeed, the only broad enactments\r\n directly sanctioning naval scourging at sea are to be found in the\r\n United States Statute Book and in the “Sea Laws” of the absolute\r\n monarch, Louis le Grand, of France.[5]\r\n    Taking for their basis the above-mentioned British Naval Code, and\r\n    ingrafting upon it the positive scourging laws, which Britain was\r\n    loth to recognise as organic statutes, our American lawgivers, in\r\n    the year 1800, framed the Articles of War now governing the\r\n    American Navy. They may be found in the second volume of the\r\n    “United States Statutes at Large,” under chapter xxxiii.—“An act\r\n    for the _better_ government of the Navy of the United States.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] For reference to the latter (L’Ord. de la Marine), _vide_ Curtis’s\r\n _Treatise on the Rights and Duties of Merchant-Seamen, according to\r\n the General Maritime Law_, Part ii., c. i.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor is it a dumb thing that the men who, in democratic Cromwell’s time,\r\nfirst proved to the nations the toughness of the British oak and the\r\nhardihood of the British sailor—that in Cromwell’s time, whose fleets\r\nstruck terror into the cruisers of France, Spain, Portugal, and\r\nHolland, and the corsairs of Algiers and the Levant; in Cromwell’s\r\ntime, when Robert Blake swept the Narrow Seas of all the keels of a\r\nDutch Admiral who insultingly carried a broom at his fore-mast; it is\r\nnot a dumb thing that, at a period deemed so glorious to the British\r\nNavy, these Articles of War were unknown.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is granted that some laws or other must have governed\r\nBlake’s sailors at that period; but they must have been far less severe\r\nthan those laid down in the written code which superseded them, since,\r\naccording to the father-in-law of James II., the Historian of the\r\nRebellion, the English Navy, prior to the enforcement of the new code,\r\nwas full of officers and sailors who, of all men, were the most\r\nrepublican. Moreover, the same author informs us that the first work\r\nundertaken by his respected son-in-law, then Duke of York, upon\r\nentering on the duties of Lord High Admiral, was to have a grand\r\nre-christening of the men-of-war, which still carried on their sterns\r\nnames too democratic to suit his high-tory ears.\r\n\r\nBut if these Articles of War were unknown in Blake’s time, and also\r\nduring the most brilliant period of Admiral Benbow’s career, what\r\ninference must follow? That such tyrannical ordinances are not\r\nindispensable—even during war—to the highest possible efficiency of a\r\nmilitary marine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n“HEREIN ARE THE GOOD ORDINANCES OF THE SEA, WHICH WISE MEN, WHO VOYAGED\r\nROUND THE WORLD, GAVE TO OUR ANCESTORS, AND WHICH CONSTITUTE THE BOOKS\r\nOF THE SCIENCE OF GOOD CUSTOMS.”—_The Consulate of the Sea_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present usages of the American Navy are such that, though there is\r\nno government enactment to that effect, yet, in many respect, its\r\nCommanders seem virtually invested with the power to observe or\r\nviolate, as seems to them fit, several of the Articles of War.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article XV., “_No person in the Navy shall quarrel with\r\nany other person in the Navy, nor use provoking or reproachful words,\r\ngestures, or menaces, on pain of such punishment as a court-martial\r\nshall adjudge_.”\r\n\r\n“_Provoking or reproachful words!_” Officers of the Navy, answer me!\r\nHave you not, many of you, a thousand times violated this law, and\r\naddressed to men, whose tongues were tied by this very Article,\r\nlanguage which no landsman would ever hearken to without flying at the\r\nthroat of his insulter? I know that worse words than _you_ ever used\r\nare to be heard addressed by a merchant-captain to his crew; but the\r\nmerchant-captain does not live under this XVth Article of War.\r\n\r\nNot to make an example of him, nor to gratify any personal feeling, but\r\nto furnish one certain illustration of what is here asserted, I\r\nhonestly declare that Captain Claret, of the Neversink, repeatedly\r\nviolated this law in his own proper person.\r\n\r\nAccording to Article III., no officer, or other person in the Navy,\r\nshall be guilty of “oppression, fraud, profane swearing, drunkenness,\r\nor any other scandalous conduct.”\r\n\r\nAgain let me ask you, officers of the Navy, whether many of you have\r\nnot repeatedly, and in more than one particular, violated this law? And\r\nhere, again, as a certain illustration, I must once more cite Captain\r\nClaret as an offender, especially in the matter of profane swearing. I\r\nmust also cite four of the lieutenants, some eight of the midshipmen,\r\nand nearly all the seamen.\r\n\r\nAdditional Articles might be quoted that are habitually violated by the\r\nofficers, while nearly all those _exclusively_ referring to the sailors\r\nare unscrupulously enforced. Yet those Articles, by which the sailor is\r\nscourged at the gangway, are not one whit more laws than those _other_\r\nArticles, binding upon the officers, that have become obsolete from\r\nimmemorial disuse; while still other Articles, to which the sailors\r\nalone are obnoxious, are observed or violated at the caprice of the\r\nCaptain. Now, if it be not so much the severity as the certainty of\r\npunishment that deters from transgression, how fatal to all proper\r\nreverence for the enactments of Congress must be this disregard of its\r\nstatutes.\r\n\r\nStill more. This violation of the law, on the part of the officers, in\r\nmany cases involves oppression to the sailor. But throughout the whole\r\nnaval code, which so hems in the mariner by law upon law, and which\r\ninvests the Captain with so much judicial and administrative authority\r\nover him—in most cases entirely discretionary—not one solitary clause\r\nis to be found which in any way provides means for a seaman deeming\r\nhimself aggrieved to obtain redress. Indeed, both the written and\r\nunwritten laws of the American Navy are as destitute of individual\r\nguarantees to the mass of seamen as the Statute Book of the despotic\r\nEmpire of Russia.\r\n\r\nWho put this great gulf between the American Captain and the American\r\nsailor? Or is the Captain a creature of like passions with ourselves?\r\nOr is he an infallible archangel, incapable of the shadow of error? Or\r\nhas a sailor no mark of humanity, no attribute of manhood, that, bound\r\nhand and foot, he is cast into an American frigate shorn of all rights\r\nand defences, while the notorious lawlessness of the Commander has\r\npassed into a proverb, familiar to man-of-war’s-men, _the law was not\r\nmade for the Captain!_ Indeed, he may almost be said to put off the\r\ncitizen when he touches his quarter-deck; and, almost exempt from the\r\nlaw of the land himself, he comes down upon others with a judicial\r\nseverity unknown on the national soil. With the Articles of War in one\r\nhand, and the cat-o’-nine-tails in the other, he stands an undignified\r\nparody upon Mohammed enforcing Moslemism with the sword and the Koran.\r\n\r\nThe concluding sections of the Articles of War treat of the naval\r\ncourts-martial before which officers are tried for serious offences as\r\nwell as the seamen. The oath administered to members of these\r\ncourts—which sometimes sit upon matters of life and death—explicitly\r\nenjoins that the members shall not “at any time divulge the vote or\r\nopinion of any particular member of the court, unless required so to do\r\nbefore a court of justice in due course of law.”\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a Council of Ten and a Star Chamber indeed! Remember,\r\nalso, that though the sailor is sometimes tried for his life before a\r\ntribunal like this, in no case do his fellow-sailors, his peers, form\r\npart of the court. Yet that a man should be tried by his peers is the\r\nfundamental principle of all civilised jurisprudence. And not only\r\ntried by his peers, but his peers must be unanimous to render a\r\nverdict; whereas, in a court-martial, the concurrence of a majority of\r\nconventional and social superiors is all that is requisite.\r\n\r\nIn the English Navy, it is said, they had a law which authorised the\r\nsailor to appeal, if he chose, from the decision of the Captain—even in\r\na comparatively trivial case—to the higher tribunal of a court-martial.\r\nIt was an English seaman who related this to me. When I said that such\r\na law must be a fatal clog to the exercise of the penal power in the\r\nCaptain, he, in substance, told me the following story.\r\n\r\nA top-man guilty of drunkenness being sent to the gratings, and the\r\nscourge about to be inflicted, he turned round and demanded a\r\ncourt-martial. The Captain smiled, and ordered him to be taken down and\r\nput into the “brig,” There he was kept in irons some weeks, when,\r\ndespairing of being liberated, he offered to compromise at two dozen\r\nlashes. “Sick of your bargain, then, are you?” said the Captain. “No,\r\nno! a court-martial you demanded, and a court-martial you shall have!”\r\nBeing at last tried before the bar of quarter-deck officers, he was\r\ncondemned to two hundred lashes. What for? for his having been drunk?\r\nNo! for his having had the insolence to appeal from an authority, in\r\nmaintaining which the men who tried and condemned him had so strong a\r\nsympathetic interest.\r\n\r\nWhether this story be wholly true or not, or whether the particular law\r\ninvolved prevails, or ever did prevail, in the English Navy, the thing,\r\nnevertheless, illustrates the ideas that man-of-war’s-men themselves\r\nhave touching the tribunals in question.\r\n\r\nWhat can be expected from a court whose deeds are done in the darkness\r\nof the recluse courts of the Spanish Inquisition? when that darkness is\r\nsolemnised by an oath on the Bible? when an oligarchy of epaulets sits\r\nupon the bench, and a plebeian top-man, without a jury, stands\r\njudicially naked at the bar?\r\n\r\nIn view of these things, and especially in view of the fact that, in\r\nseveral cases, the degree of punishment inflicted upon a\r\nman-of-war’s-man is absolutely left to the discretion of the court,\r\nwhat shame should American legislators take to themselves, that with\r\nperfect truth we may apply to the entire body of the American\r\nman-of-war’s-men that infallible principle of Sir Edward Coke: “It is\r\none of the genuine marks of servitude to have the law either concealed\r\nor precarious.” But still better may we subscribe to the saying of Sir\r\nMatthew Hale in his History of the Common Law, that “the Martial Law,\r\nbeing based upon no settled principles, is, in truth and reality, no\r\nlaw, but something indulged rather than allowed as a law.”\r\n\r\nI know it may be said that the whole nature of this naval code is\r\npurposely adapted to the war exigencies of the Navy. But waiving the\r\ngrave question that might be raised concerning the moral, not judicial,\r\nlawfulness of this arbitrary code, even in time of war; be it asked,\r\nwhy it is in force during a time of peace? The United States has now\r\nexisted as a nation upward of seventy years, and in all that time the\r\nalleged necessity for the operation of the naval code—in cases deemed\r\ncapital—has only existed during a period of two or three years at most.\r\n\r\nSome may urge that the severest operations of the code are tacitly made\r\nnull in time of peace. But though with respect to several of the\r\nArticles this holds true, yet at any time any and all of them may be\r\nlegally enforced. Nor have there been wanting recent instances,\r\nillustrating the spirit of this code, even in cases where the letter of\r\nthe code was not altogether observed. The well-known case of a United\r\nStates brig furnishes a memorable example, which at any moment may be\r\nrepeated. Three men, in a time of peace, were then hung at the\r\nyard-arm, merely because, in the Captain’s judgment, it became\r\nnecessary to hang them. To this day the question of their complete\r\nguilt is socially discussed.\r\n\r\nHow shall we characterise such a deed? Says Blackstone, “If any one\r\nthat hath commission of martial authority doth, in time of peace, hang,\r\nor otherwise execute any man by colour of martial law, this is murder;\r\nfor it is against Magna Charta.”* [* Commentaries, b. i., c. xiii.]\r\n\r\nMagna Charta! We moderns, who may be landsmen, may justly boast of\r\ncivil immunities not possessed by our forefathers; but our remoter\r\nforefathers who happened to be mariners may straighten themselves even\r\nin their ashes to think that their lawgivers were wiser and more humane\r\nin their generation than our lawgivers in ours. Compare the sea-laws of\r\nour Navy with the Roman and Rhodian ocean ordinances; compare them with\r\nthe “Consulate of the Sea;” compare them with the Laws of the Hanse\r\nTowns; compare them with the ancient Wisbury laws. In the last we find\r\nthat they were ocean democrats in those days. “If he strikes, he ought\r\nto receive blow for blow.” Thus speak out the Wisbury laws concerning a\r\nGothland sea-captain.\r\n\r\nIn final reference to all that has been said in previous chapters\r\ntouching the severity and unusualness of the laws of the American Navy,\r\nand the large authority vested in its commanding officers, be it here\r\nobserved, that White-Jacket is not unaware of the fact, that the\r\nresponsibility of an officer commanding at sea—whether in the merchant\r\nservice or the national marine—is unparalleled by that of any other\r\nrelation in which man may stand to man. Nor is he unmindful that both\r\nwisdom and humanity dictate that, from the peculiarity of his position,\r\na sea-officer in command should be clothed with a degree of authority\r\nand discretion inadmissible in any master ashore. But, at the same\r\ntime, these principles—recognised by all writers on maritime law—have\r\nundoubtedly furnished warrant for clothing modern sea-commanders and\r\nnaval courts-martial with powers which exceed the due limits of reason\r\nand necessity. Nor is this the only instance where right and salutary\r\nprinciples, in themselves almost self-evident and infallible, have been\r\nadvanced in justification of things, which in themselves are just as\r\nself-evidently wrong and pernicious.\r\n\r\nBe it here, once and for all, understood, that no sentimental and\r\ntheoretic love for the common sailor; no romantic belief in that\r\npeculiar noble-heartedness and exaggerated generosity of disposition\r\nfictitiously imputed to him in novels; and no prevailing desire to gain\r\nthe reputation of being his friend, have actuated me in anything I have\r\nsaid, in any part of this work, touching the gross oppression under\r\nwhich I know that the sailors suffers. Indifferent as to who may be the\r\nparties concerned, I but desire to see wrong things righted, and equal\r\njustice administered to all.\r\n\r\nNor, as has been elsewhere hinted, is the general ignorance or\r\ndepravity of any race of men to be alleged as an apology for tyranny\r\nover them. On the contrary, it cannot admit of a reasonable doubt, in\r\nany unbiased mind conversant with the interior life of a man-of-war,\r\nthat most of the sailor iniquities practised therein are indirectly to\r\nbe ascribed to the morally debasing effects of the unjust, despotic,\r\nand degrading laws under which the man-of-war’s-man lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\nNIGHT AND DAY GAMBLING IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nMention has been made that the game of draughts, or checkers, was\r\npermitted to be played on board the Neversink. At the present time,\r\nwhile there was little or no shipwork to be done, and all hands, in\r\nhigh spirits, were sailing homeward over the warm smooth sea of the\r\ntropics; so numerous became the players, scattered about the decks,\r\nthat our First Lieutenant used ironically to say that it was a pity\r\nthey were not tesselated with squares of white and black marble, for\r\nthe express benefit and convenience of the players. Had this gentleman\r\nhad his way, our checker-boards would very soon have been pitched out\r\nof the ports. But the Captain—usually lenient in some things—permitted\r\nthem, and so Mr. Bridewell was fain to hold his peace.\r\n\r\nBut, although this one game was allowable in the frigate, all kinds of\r\ngambling were strictly interdicted, under the penalty of the gangway;\r\nnor were cards or dice tolerated in any way whatever. This regulation\r\nwas indispensable, for, of all human beings, man-of-war’s-men are\r\nperhaps the most inclined to gambling. The reason must be obvious to\r\nany one who reflects upon their condition on shipboard. And\r\ngambling—the most mischievous of vices anywhere—in a man-of-war\r\noperates still more perniciously than on shore. But quite as often as\r\nthe law against smuggling spirits is transgressed by the unscrupulous\r\nsailors, the statutes against cards and dice are evaded.\r\n\r\nSable night, which, since the beginning of the world, has winked and\r\nlooked on at so many deeds of iniquity—night is the time usually\r\nselected for their operations by man-of-war gamblers. The place pitched\r\nupon is generally the berth-deck, where the hammocks are swung, and\r\nwhich is lighted so stintedly as not to disturb the sleeping seamen\r\nwith any obtruding glare. In so spacious an area the two lanterns\r\nswinging from the stanchions diffuse a subdued illumination, like a\r\nnight-taper in the apartment of some invalid. Owing to their position,\r\nalso, these lanterns are far from shedding an impartial light, however\r\ndim, but fling long angular rays here and there, like burglar’s\r\ndark-lanterns in the fifty-acre vaults of the West India Docks on the\r\nThames.\r\n\r\nIt may well be imagined, therefore, how well adapted is this mysterious\r\nand subterranean Hall of Eblis to the clandestine proceedings of\r\ngamblers, especially as the hammocks not only hang thickly, but many of\r\nthem swing very low, within two feet of the floor, thus forming\r\ninnumerable little canvas glens, grottoes, nooks, corners, and\r\ncrannies, where a good deal of wickedness may be practiced by the wary\r\nwith considerable impunity.\r\n\r\nNow the master-at-arms, assisted by his mates, the ship’s corporals,\r\nreigns supreme in these bowels of the ship. Throughout the night these\r\npolicemen relieve each other at standing guard over the premises; and,\r\nexcept when the watches are called, they sit in the midst of a profound\r\nsilence, only invaded by trumpeters’ snores, or the ramblings of some\r\nold sheet-anchor-man in his sleep.\r\n\r\nThe two ship’s corporals went among the sailors by the names of Leggs\r\nand Pounce; Pounce had been a policeman, it was said, in Liverpool;\r\nLeggs, a turnkey attached to “The Tombs” in New York. Hence their\r\neducation eminently fitted them for their stations; and Bland, the\r\nmaster-at-arms, ravished with their dexterity in prying out offenders,\r\nused to call them his two right hands.\r\n\r\nWhen man-of-war’s-men desire to gamble, they appoint the hour, and\r\nselect some certain corner, in some certain shadow, behind some certain\r\nhammock. They then contribute a small sum toward a joint fund, to be\r\ninvested in a bribe for some argus-eyed shipmate, who shall play the\r\npart of a spy upon the master-at-arms and corporals while the gaming is\r\nin progress. In nine cases out of ten these arrangements are so cunning\r\nand comprehensive, that the gamblers, eluding all vigilance, conclude\r\ntheir game unmolested. But now and then, seduced into unwariness, or\r\nperhaps, from parsimony, being unwilling to employ the services of a\r\nspy, they are suddenly lighted upon by the constables, remorselessly\r\ncollared, and dragged into the brig there to await a dozen lashes in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nSeveral times at midnight I have been startled out of a sound sleep by\r\na sudden, violent rush under my hammock, caused by the abrupt breaking\r\nup of some nest of gamblers, who have scattered in all directions,\r\nbrushing under the tiers of swinging pallets, and setting them all in a\r\nrocking commotion.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, while laying in port that gambling most thrives in a\r\nman-of-war. Then the men frequently practice their dark deeds in the\r\nlight of the day, and the additional guards which, at such times, they\r\ndeem indispensable, are not unworthy of note. More especially, their\r\nextra precautions in engaging the services of several spies,\r\nnecessitate a considerable expenditure, so that, in port, the diversion\r\nof gambling rises to the dignity of a nabob luxury.\r\n\r\nDuring the day the master-at-arms and his corporals are continually\r\nprowling about on all three decks, eager to spy out iniquities. At one\r\ntime, for example, you see Leggs switching his magisterial rattan, and\r\nlurking round the fore-mast on the spar-deck; the next moment, perhaps,\r\nhe is three decks down, out of sight, prowling among the cable-tiers.\r\nJust so with his master, and Pounce his coadjutor; they are here,\r\nthere, and everywhere, seemingly gifted with ubiquity.\r\n\r\nIn order successfully to carry on their proceedings by day, the\r\ngamblers must see to it that each of these constables is relentlessly\r\ndogged wherever he goes; so that, in case of his approach toward the\r\nspot where themselves are engaged, they may be warned of the fact in\r\ntime to make good their escape. Accordingly, light and active scouts\r\nare selected to follow the constable about. From their youthful\r\nalertness and activity, the boys of the mizzen-top are generally chosen\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Onboard of most men-of-war there is a set of sly,\r\nknavish foxes among the crew, destitute of every principle of honour,\r\nand on a par with Irish informers. In man-of-war parlance, they come\r\nunder the denomination of _fancy-men_ and _white-mice_, They are called\r\n_fancy-men_ because, from their zeal in craftily reporting offenders,\r\nthey are presumed to be regarded with high favour by some of the\r\nofficers. Though it is seldom that these informers can be certainly\r\nindividualised, so secret and subtle are they in laying their\r\ninformation, yet certain of the crew, and especially certain of the\r\nmarines, are invariably suspected to be _fancy-men_ and _white-mice_,\r\nand are accordingly more or less hated by their comrades.\r\n\r\nNow, in addition to having an eye on the master-at-arms and his aids,\r\nthe day-gamblers must see to it, that every person suspected of being a\r\n_white-mouse_ or _fancy-man_, is like-wise dogged wherever he goes.\r\nAdditional scouts are retained constantly to snuff at their trail. But\r\nthe mysteries of man-of-war vice are wonderful; and it is now to be\r\nrecorded, that, from long habit and observation, and familiarity with\r\nthe _guardo moves_ and _manoeuvres_ of a frigate, the master-at-arms\r\nand his aids can almost invariably tell when any gambling is going on\r\nby day; though, in the crowded vessel, abounding in decks, tops, dark\r\nplaces, and outlandish corners of all sorts, they may not be able to\r\npounce upon the identical spot where the gamblers are hidden.\r\n\r\nDuring the period that Bland was suspended from his office as\r\nmaster-at-arms, a person who, among the sailors, went by the name of\r\nSneak, having been long suspected to have been a _white-mouse_, was put\r\nin Bland’s place. He proved a hangdog, sidelong catch-thief, but gifted\r\nwith a marvellous perseverance in ferreting out culprits; following in\r\ntheir track like an inevitable Cuba blood-hound, with his noiseless\r\nnose. When disconcerted, however, you sometimes heard his bay.\r\n\r\n“The muffled dice are somewhere around,” Sneak would say to his aids;\r\n“there are them three chaps, there, been dogging me about for the last\r\nhalf-hour. I say, Pounce, has any one been scouting around _you_ this\r\nmorning?”\r\n\r\n“Four on ’em,” says Pounce. “I know’d it; I know’d the muffled dice was\r\nrattlin’!”\r\n\r\n“Leggs!” says the master-at-arms to his other aid, “Leggs, how is it\r\nwith _you_—any spies?”\r\n\r\n“Ten on’ em,” says Leggs. “There’s one on ’em now—that fellow stitching\r\na hat.”\r\n\r\n“Halloo, you, sir!” cried the master-at-arms, “top your boom and sail\r\nlarge, now. If I see you about me again, I’ll have you up to the mast.”\r\n\r\n“What am I a-doin’ now?” says the hat-stitcher, with a face as long as\r\na rope-walk. “Can’t a feller be workin’ here, without being ’spected of\r\nTom Coxe’s traverse, up one ladder and down t’other?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know the moves, sir; I have been on board a _guardo_. Top your\r\nboom, I say, and be off, or I’ll have you hauled up and riveted in a\r\nclinch—both fore-tacks over the main-yard, and no bloody knife to cut\r\nthe seizing. Sheer! or I’ll pitch into you like a shin of beef into a\r\nbeggar’s wallet.”\r\n\r\nIt is often observable, that, in vessels of all kinds, the men who talk\r\nthe most sailor lingo are the least sailor-like in reality. You may\r\nsometimes hear even marines jerk out more salt phrases than the Captain\r\nof the Forecastle himself. On the other hand, when not actively engaged\r\nin his vocation, you would take the best specimen of a seaman for a\r\nlandsman. When you see a fellow yawning about the docks like a\r\nhomeward-bound Indiaman, a long Commodore’s pennant of black ribbon\r\nflying from his mast-head, and fetching up at a grog-shop with a slew\r\nof his hull, as if an Admiral were coming alongside a three-decker in\r\nhis barge; you may put that man down for what man-of-war’s-men call a\r\n_damn-my-eyes-tar_, that is, a humbug. And many damn-my-eyes humbugs\r\nthere are in this man-of-war world of ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\nTHE MAIN-TOP AT NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of our run from Rio to the Line was one delightful yachting,\r\nso far as fine weather and the ship’s sailing were concerned. It was\r\nespecially pleasant when our quarter-watch lounged in the main-top,\r\ndiverting ourselves in many agreeable ways. Removed from the immediate\r\npresence of the officers, we there harmlessly enjoyed ourselves, more\r\nthan in any other part of the ship. By day, many of us were very\r\nindustrious, making hats or mending our clothes. But by night we became\r\nmore romantically inclined.\r\n\r\nOften Jack Chase, an enthusiastic admirer of sea-scenery, would direct\r\nour attention to the moonlight on the waves, by fine snatches from his\r\ncatalogue of poets. I shall never forget the lyric air with which, one\r\nmorning, at dawn of day, when all the East was flushed with red and\r\ngold, he stood leaning against the top-mast shrouds, and stretching his\r\nbold hand over the sea, exclaimed, “Here comes Aurora: top-mates, see!”\r\nAnd, in a liquid, long-lingering tone, he recited the lines,\r\n\r\n     “With gentle hand, as seeming oft to pause,\r\n      The purple curtains of the morn she draws.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Commodore Camoens, White-Jacket.—But bear a hand there; we must rig\r\nout that stun’-sail boom—the wind is shifting.”\r\n\r\nFrom our lofty perch, of a moonlight night, the frigate itself was a\r\nglorious sight. She was going large before the wind, her stun’-sails\r\nset on both sides, so that the canvas on the main-mast and fore-mast\r\npresented the appearance of majestic, tapering pyramids, more than a\r\nhundred feet broad at the base, and terminating in the clouds with the\r\nlight copestone of the royals. That immense area of snow-white canvas\r\nsliding along the sea was indeed a magnificent spectacle. The three\r\nshrouded masts looked like the apparitions of three gigantic Turkish\r\nEmirs striding over the ocean.\r\n\r\nNor, at times, was the sound of music wanting, to augment the poetry of\r\nthe scene. The whole band would be assembled on the poop, regaling the\r\nofficers, and incidentally ourselves, with their fine old airs. To\r\nthese, some of us would occasionally dance in the _top_, which was\r\nalmost as large as an ordinary sized parlour. When the instrumental\r\nmelody of the band was not to be had, our nightingales mustered their\r\nvoices, and gave us a song.\r\n\r\nUpon these occasions Jack Chase was often called out, and regaled us,\r\nin his own free and noble style, with the “_Spanish Ladies_”—a\r\nfavourite thing with British man-of-war’s-men—and many other salt-sea\r\nballads and ditties, including,\r\n\r\n     “Sir Patrick Spens was the best sailor\r\n      That ever sailed the sea.”\r\n\r\n\r\nalso,\r\n\r\n     “And three times around spun our gallant ship;\r\n          Three times around spun she;\r\n      Three times around spun our gallant ship,\r\n          And she went to the bottom of the sea—\r\n              The sea, the sea, the sea,\r\n      And she went to the bottom of the sea!”\r\n\r\n\r\nThese songs would be varied by sundry _yarns_ and _twisters_ of the\r\ntop-men. And it was at these times that I always endeavoured to draw\r\nout the oldest Tritons into narratives of the war-service they had\r\nseen. There were but few of them, it is true, who had been in action;\r\nbut that only made their narratives the more valuable.\r\n\r\nThere was an old negro, who went by the name of Tawney, a\r\nsheet-anchor-man, whom we often invited into our top of tranquil\r\nnights, to hear him discourse. He was a staid and sober seaman, very\r\nintelligent, with a fine, frank bearing, one of the best men in the\r\nship, and held in high estimation by every one.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, during the last war between England and America, he had,\r\nwith several others, been “impressed” upon the high seas, out of a New\r\nEngland merchantman. The ship that impressed him was an English\r\nfrigate, the Macedonian, afterward taken by the Neversink, the ship in\r\nwhich we were sailing.\r\n\r\nIt was the holy Sabbath, according to Tawney, and, as the Briton bore\r\ndown on the American—her men at their quarters—Tawney and his\r\ncountrymen, who happened to be stationed at the quarter-deck battery,\r\nrespectfully accosted the captain—an old man by the name of Cardan—as\r\nhe passed them, in his rapid promenade, his spy-glass under his arm.\r\nAgain they assured him that they were not Englishmen, and that it was a\r\nmost bitter thing to lift their hands against the flag of that country\r\nwhich harboured the mothers that bore them. They conjured him to\r\nrelease them from their guns, and allow them to remain neutral during\r\nthe conflict. But when a ship of any nation is running into action, it\r\nis no time for argument, small time for justice, and not much time for\r\nhumanity. Snatching a pistol from the belt of a boarder standing by,\r\nthe Captain levelled it at the heads of the three sailors, and\r\ncommanded them instantly to their quarters, under penalty of being shot\r\non the spot. So, side by side with his country’s foes, Tawney and his\r\ncompanions toiled at the guns, and fought out the fight to the last;\r\nwith the exception of one of them, who was killed at his post by one of\r\nhis own country’s balls.\r\n\r\nAt length, having lost her fore and main-top-masts, and her mizzen-mast\r\nhaving been shot away to the deck, and her fore-yard lying in two\r\npieces on her shattered forecastle, and in a hundred places having been\r\n_hulled_ with round shot, the English frigate was reduced to the last\r\nextremity. Captain Cardan ordered his signal quarter-master to strike\r\nthe flag.\r\n\r\nTawney was one of those who, at last, helped pull him on board the\r\nNeversink. As he touched the deck, Cardan saluted Decatur, the hostile\r\ncommander, and offered his sword; but it was courteously declined.\r\nPerhaps the victor remembered the dinner parties that he and the\r\nEnglishman had enjoyed together in Norfolk, just previous to the\r\nbreaking out of hostilities—and while both were in command of the very\r\nfrigates now crippled on the sea. The Macedonian, it seems, had gone\r\ninto Norfolk with dispatches. _Then_ they had laughed and joked over\r\ntheir wine, and a wager of a beaver hat was said to have been made\r\nbetween them upon the event of the hostile meeting of their ships.\r\n\r\nGazing upon the heavy batteries before him, Cardan said to Decatur,\r\n“This is a seventy-four, not a frigate; no wonder the day is yours!”\r\n\r\nThis remark was founded upon the Neversink’s superiority in guns. The\r\nNeversink’s main-deck-batteries then consisted, as now, of\r\ntwenty-four-pounders; the Macedonian’s of only eighteens. In all, the\r\nNeversink numbered fifty-four guns and four hundred and fifty men; the\r\nMacedonian, forty-nine guns and three hundred men; a very great\r\ndisparity, which, united to the other circumstances of this action,\r\ndeprives the victory of all claims to glory beyond those that might be\r\nset up by a river-horse getting the better of a seal.\r\n\r\nBut if Tawney spoke truth—and he was a truth-telling man this fact\r\nseemed counterbalanced by a circumstance he related. When the guns of\r\nthe Englishman were examined, after the engagement, in more than one\r\ninstance the wad was found rammed against the cartridge, without\r\nintercepting the ball. And though, in a frantic sea-fight, such a thing\r\nmight be imputed to hurry and remissness, yet Tawney, a stickler for\r\nhis tribe, always ascribed it to quite a different and less honourable\r\ncause. But, even granting the cause he assigned to have been the true\r\none, it does not involve anything inimical to the general valour\r\ndisplayed by the British crew. Yet, from all that may be learned from\r\ncandid persons who have been in sea-fights, there can be but little\r\ndoubt that on board of all ships, of whatever nation, in time of\r\naction, no very small number of the men are exceedingly nervous, to say\r\nthe least, at the guns; ramming and sponging at a venture. And what\r\nspecial patriotic interest could an impressed man, for instance, take\r\nin a fight, into which he had been dragged from the arms of his wife?\r\nOr is it to be wondered at that impressed English seamen have not\r\nscrupled, in time of war, to cripple the arm that has enslaved them?\r\n\r\nDuring the same general war which prevailed at and previous to the\r\nperiod of the frigate-action here spoken of, a British flag-officer, in\r\nwriting to the Admiralty, said, “Everything appears to be quiet in the\r\nfleet; but, in preparing for battle last week, several of the guns in\r\nthe after part of the ship were found to be spiked;” that is to say,\r\nrendered useless. Who had spiked them? The dissatisfied seamen. Is it\r\naltogether improbable, then, that the guns to which Tawney referred\r\nwere manned by men who purposely refrained from making them tell on the\r\nfoe; that, in this one action, the victory America gained was partly\r\nwon for her by the sulky insubordination of the enemy himself?\r\n\r\nDuring this same period of general war, it was frequently the case that\r\nthe guns of English armed ships were found in the mornings with their\r\nbreechings cut over night. This maiming of the guns, and for the time\r\nincapacitating them, was only to be imputed to that secret spirit of\r\nhatred to the service which induced the spiking above referred to. But\r\neven in cases where no deep-seated dissatisfaction was presumed to\r\nprevail among the crew, and where a seaman, in time of action, impelled\r\nby pure fear, “shirked from his gun;” it seems but flying in the face\r\nof Him who made such a seaman what he constitutionally was, to sew\r\n_coward_ upon his back, and degrade and agonise the already trembling\r\nwretch in numberless other ways. Nor seems it a practice warranted by\r\nthe Sermon on the Mount, for the officer of a battery, in time of\r\nbattle, to stand over the men with his drawn sword (as was done in the\r\nMacedonian), and run through on the spot the first seaman who showed a\r\nsemblance of fear. Tawney told me that he distinctly heard this order\r\ngiven by the English Captain to his officers of divisions. Were the\r\nsecret history of all sea-fights written, the laurels of sea-heroes\r\nwould turn to ashes on their brows.\r\n\r\nAnd how nationally disgraceful, in every conceivable point of view, is\r\nthe IV. of our American Articles of War: “If any person in the Navy\r\nshall pusillanimously cry for quarter, he shall suffer death.” Thus,\r\nwith death before his face from the foe, and death behind his back from\r\nhis countrymen, the best valour of a man-of-war’s-man can never assume\r\nthe merit of a noble spontaneousness. In this, as in every other case,\r\nthe Articles of War hold out no reward for good conduct, but only\r\ncompel the sailor to fight, like a hired murderer, for his pay, by\r\ndigging his grave before his eyes if he hesitates.\r\n\r\nBut this Article IV. is open to still graver objections. Courage is the\r\nmost common and vulgar of the virtues; the only one shared with us by\r\nthe beasts of the field; the one most apt, by excess, to run into\r\nviciousness. And since Nature generally takes away with one hand to\r\ncounter-balance her gifts with the other, excessive animal courage, in\r\nmany cases, only finds room in a character vacated of loftier things.\r\nBut in a naval officer, animal courage is exalted to the loftiest\r\nmerit, and often procures him a distinguished command.\r\n\r\nHence, if some brainless bravo be Captain of a frigate in action, he\r\nmay fight her against invincible odds, and seek to crown himself with\r\nthe glory of the shambles, by permitting his hopeless crew to be\r\nbutchered before his eyes, while at the same time that crew must\r\nconsent to be slaughtered by the foe, under penalty of being murdered\r\nby the law. Look at the engagement between the American frigate Essex\r\nwith the two English cruisers, the Phoebe and Cherub, off the Bay of\r\nValparaiso, during the late war. It is admitted on all hands that the\r\nAmerican Captain continued to fight his crippled ship against a greatly\r\nsuperior force; and when, at last, it became physically impossible that\r\nhe could ever be otherwise than vanquished in the end; and when, from\r\npeculiarly unfortunate circumstances, his men merely stood up to their\r\nnearly useless batteries to be dismembered and blown to pieces by the\r\nincessant fire of the enemy’s long guns. Nor, by thus continuing to\r\nfight, did this American frigate, one iota, promote the true interests\r\nof her country. I seek not to underrate any reputation which the\r\nAmerican Captain may have gained by this battle. He was a brave man;\r\n_that_ no sailor will deny. But the whole world is made up of brave\r\nmen. Yet I would not be at all understood as impugning his special good\r\nname. Nevertheless, it is not to be doubted, that if there were any\r\ncommon-sense sailors at the guns of the Essex, however valiant they may\r\nhave been, those common-sense sailors must have greatly preferred to\r\nstrike their flag, when they saw the day was fairly lost, than postpone\r\nthat inevitable act till there were few American arms left to assist in\r\nhauling it down. Yet had these men, under these circumstances,\r\n“pusillanimously cried for quarter,” by the IV. Article of War they\r\nmight have been legally hung.\r\n\r\nAccording to the negro, Tawney, when the Captain of the\r\nMacedonian—seeing that the Neversink had his vessel completely in her\r\npower—gave the word to strike the flag, one of his officers, a man\r\nhated by the seamen for his tyranny, howled out the most terrific\r\nremonstrances, swearing that, for his part, he would not give up, but\r\nwas for sinking the Macedonian alongside the enemy. Had he been\r\nCaptain, doubtless he would have done so; thereby gaining the name of a\r\nhero in this world;—but what would they have called him in the next?\r\n\r\nBut as the whole matter of war is a thing that smites common-sense and\r\nChristianity in the face; so everything connected with it is utterly\r\nfoolish, unchristian, barbarous, brutal, and savouring of the Feejee\r\nIslands, cannibalism, saltpetre, and the devil.\r\n\r\nIt is generally the case in a man-of-war when she strikes her flag that\r\nall discipline is at an end, and the men for a time are ungovernable.\r\nThis was so on board of the English frigate. The spirit-room was broken\r\nopen, and buckets of grog were passed along the decks, where many of\r\nthe wounded were lying between the guns. These mariners seized the\r\nbuckets, and, spite of all remonstrances, gulped down the burning\r\nspirits, till, as Tawney said, the blood suddenly spirted out of their\r\nwounds, and they fell dead to the deck.\r\n\r\nThe negro had many more stories to tell of this fight; and frequently\r\nhe would escort me along our main-deck batteries—still mounting the\r\nsame guns used in the battle—pointing out their ineffaceable\r\nindentations and scars. Coated over with the accumulated paint of more\r\nthan thirty years, they were almost invisible to a casual eye; but\r\nTawney knew them all by heart; for he had returned home in the\r\nNeversink, and had beheld these scars shortly after the engagement.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, I was walking with him along the gun-deck, when he\r\npaused abreast of the main-mast. “This part of the ship,” said he, “we\r\ncalled the _slaughter-house_ on board the Macedonian. Here the men\r\nfell, five and six at a time. An enemy always directs its shot here, in\r\norder to hurl over the mast, if possible. The beams and carlines\r\noverhead in the Macedonian _slaughter-house_ were spattered with blood\r\nand brains. About the hatchways it looked like a butcher’s stall; bits\r\nof human flesh sticking in the ring-bolts. A pig that ran about the\r\ndecks escaped unharmed, but his hide was so clotted with blood, from\r\nrooting among the pools of gore, that when the ship struck the sailors\r\nhove the animal overboard, swearing that it would be rank cannibalism\r\nto eat him.”\r\n\r\nAnother quadruped, a goat, lost its fore legs in this fight.\r\n\r\nThe sailors who were killed—according to the usual custom—were ordered\r\nto be thrown overboard as soon as they fell; no doubt, as the negro\r\nsaid, that the sight of so many corpses lying around might not appall\r\nthe survivors at the guns. Among other instances, he related the\r\nfollowing. A shot entering one of the port-holes, dashed dead two\r\nthirds of a gun’s crew. The captain of the next gun, dropping his\r\nlock-string, which he had just pulled, turned over the heap of bodies\r\nto see who they were; when, perceiving an old messmate, who had sailed\r\nwith him in many cruises, he burst into tears, and, taking the corpse\r\nup in his arms, and going with it to the side, held it over the water a\r\nmoment, and eying it, cried, “Oh God! Tom!”—“D——n your prayers over\r\nthat thing! overboard with it, and down to your gun!” roared a wounded\r\nLieutenant. The order was obeyed, and the heart-stricken sailor\r\nreturned to his post.\r\n\r\nTawney’s recitals were enough to snap this man-of-war world’s sword in\r\nits scabbard. And thinking of all the cruel carnal glory wrought out by\r\nnaval heroes in scenes like these, I asked myself whether, indeed, that\r\nwas a glorious coffin in which Lord Nelson was entombed—a coffin\r\npresented to him, during life, by Captain Hallowell; it had been dug\r\nout of the main-most of the French line-of-battle ship L’Orient, which,\r\nburning up with British fire, destroyed hundreds of Frenchmen at the\r\nbattle of the Nile.\r\n\r\nPeace to Lord Nelson where he sleeps in his mouldering mast! but rather\r\nwould I be urned in the trunk of some green tree, and even in death\r\nhave the vital sap circulating round me, giving of my dead body to the\r\nliving foliage that shaded my peaceful tomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n“SINK, BURN, AND DESTROY.”—_Printed Admiralty orders in time of war_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong innumerable “_yarns and twisters_” reeled off in our main-top\r\nduring our pleasant run to the North, none could match those of Jack\r\nChase, our captain.\r\n\r\nNever was there better company than ever-glorious Jack. The things\r\nwhich most men only read of, or dream about, he had seen and\r\nexperienced. He had been a dashing smuggler in his day, and could tell\r\nof a long nine-pounder rammed home with wads of French silks; of\r\ncartridges stuffed with the finest gunpowder tea; of cannister-shot\r\nfull of West India sweetmeats; of sailor frocks and trowsers, quilted\r\ninside with costly laces; and table legs, hollow as musket barrels,\r\ncompactly stowed with rare drugs and spices. He could tell of a wicked\r\nwidow, too—a beautiful receiver of smuggled goods upon the English\r\ncoast—who smiled so sweetly upon the smugglers when they sold her silks\r\nand laces, cheap as tape and ginghams. She called them gallant fellows,\r\nhearts of game; and bade them bring her more.\r\n\r\nHe could tell of desperate fights with his British majesty’s cutters,\r\nin midnight coves upon a stormy coast; of the capture of a reckless\r\nband, and their being drafted on board a man-of-war; of their swearing\r\nthat their chief was slain; of a writ of habeas corpus sent on board\r\nfor one of them for a debt—a reserved and handsome man—and his going\r\nashore, strongly suspected of being the slaughtered captain, and this a\r\nsuccessful scheme for his escape.\r\n\r\nBut more than all, Jack could tell of the battle of Navarino, for he\r\nhad been a captain of one of the main-deck guns on board Admiral\r\nCodrington’s flag-ship, the Asia. Were mine the style of stout old\r\nChapman’s Homer, even then I would scarce venture to give noble Jack’s\r\nown version of this fight, wherein, on the 20th of October, A. D. 1827,\r\nthirty-two sail of Englishmen, Frenchmen, and Russians, attacked and\r\nvanquished in the Levant an Ottoman fleet of three ships-of-the line,\r\ntwenty-five frigates, and a swarm of fire ships and hornet craft.\r\n\r\n“We bayed to be at them,” said Jack; “and when we _did_ open fire, we\r\nwere like dolphin among the flying-fish. ‘Every man take his bird’ was\r\nthe cry, when we trained our guns. And those guns all smoked like rows\r\nof Dutch pipe-bowls, my hearties! My gun’s crew carried small flags in\r\ntheir bosoms, to nail to the mast in case the ship’s colours were shot\r\naway. Stripped to the waistbands, we fought like skinned tigers, and\r\nbowled down the Turkish frigates like nine-pins. Among their\r\nshrouds—swarming thick with small-arm men, like flights of pigeons\r\nlighted on pine-trees—our marines sent their leaden pease and\r\ngoose-berries, like a shower of hail-stones in Labrador. It was a\r\nstormy time, my hearties! The blasted Turks pitched into the old Asia’s\r\nhull a whole quarry of marble shot, each ball one hundred and fifty\r\npounds. They knocked three port-holes into one. But we gave them better\r\nthan they sent. ‘Up and at them, my bull-dog!’ said I, patting my gun\r\non the breech; ‘tear open hatchways in their Moslem sides!\r\nWhite-Jacket, my lad, you ought to have been there. The bay was covered\r\nwith masts and yards, as I have seen a raft of snags in the Arkansas\r\nRiver. Showers of burned rice and olives from the exploding foe fell\r\nupon us like manna in the wilderness. ‘_Allah! Allah! Mohammed!\r\nMohammed!_’ split the air; some cried it out from the Turkish\r\nport-holes; others shrieked it forth from the drowning waters, their\r\ntop-knots floating on their shaven skulls, like black snakes on\r\nhalf-tide rocks. By those top-knots they believed that their Prophet\r\nwould drag them up to Paradise, but they sank fifty fathoms, my\r\nhearties, to the bottom of the bay. ‘Ain’t the bloody ’Hometons going\r\nto strike yet?’ cried my first loader, a Guernsey man, thrusting his\r\nneck out of the port-hole, and looking at the Turkish\r\nline-of-battle-ship near by. That instant his head blew by me like a\r\nbursting Paixhan shot, and the flag of Neb Knowles himself was hauled\r\ndown for ever. We dragged his hull to one side, and avenged him with\r\nthe cooper’s anvil, which, endways, we rammed home; a mess-mate shoved\r\nin the dead man’s bloody Scotch cap for the wad, and sent it flying\r\ninto the line-of-battle ship. By the god of war! boys, we hardly left\r\nenough of that craft to boil a pot of water with. It was a hard day’s\r\nwork—a sad day’s work, my hearties. That night, when all was over, I\r\nslept sound enough, with a box of cannister shot for my pillow! But you\r\nought to have seen the boat-load of Turkish flags one of our captains\r\ncarried home; he swore to dress his father’s orchard in colours with\r\nthem, just as our spars are dressed for a gala day.”\r\n\r\n“Though you tormented the Turks at Navarino, noble Jack, yet you came\r\noff yourself with only the loss of a splinter, it seems,” said a\r\ntop-man, glancing at our captain’s maimed hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes; but I and one of the Lieutenants had a narrower escape than that.\r\nA shot struck the side of my port-hole, and sent the splinters right\r\nand left. One took off my hat rim clean to my brow; another _razed_ the\r\nLieutenant’s left boot, by slicing off the heel; a third shot killed my\r\npowder-monkey without touching him.”\r\n\r\n“How, Jack?”\r\n\r\n“It _whizzed_ the poor babe dead. He was seated on a _cheese of wads_\r\nat the time, and after the dust of the powdered bulwarks had blown\r\naway, I noticed he yet sat still, his eyes wide open. ‘_My little\r\nhero!_’ cried I, and I clapped him on the back; but he fell on his face\r\nat my feet. I touched his heart, and found he was dead. There was not a\r\nlittle finger mark on him.”\r\n\r\nSilence now fell upon the listeners for a time, broken at last by the\r\nSecond Captain of the Top.\r\n\r\n“Noble Jack, I know you never brag, but tell us what you did yourself\r\nthat day?”\r\n\r\n“Why, my hearties, I did not do quite as much as my gun. But I flatter\r\nmyself it was that gun that brought clown the Turkish Admiral’s\r\nmain-mast; and the stump left wasn’t long enough to make a wooden leg\r\nfor Lord Nelson.”\r\n\r\n“How? but I thought, by the way you pull a lock-string on board here,\r\nand look along the sight, that you can steer a shot about right—hey,\r\nJack?”\r\n\r\n“It was the Admiral of the fleet—God Almighty—who directed the shot\r\nthat dismasted the Turkish Admiral,” said Jack; “I only pointed the\r\ngun.”\r\n\r\n“But how did you feel, Jack, when the musket-ball carried away one of\r\nyour hooks there?”\r\n\r\n“Feel! only a finger the lighter. I have seven more left, besides\r\nthumbs; and they did good service, too, in the torn rigging the day\r\nafter the fight; for you must know, my hearties, that the hardest work\r\ncomes after the guns are run in. Three days I helped work, with one\r\nhand, in the rigging, in the same trowsers that I wore in the action;\r\nthe blood had dried and stiffened; they looked like glazed red\r\nmorocco.”\r\n\r\nNow, this Jack Chase had a heart in him like a mastodon’s. I have seen\r\nhim weep when a man has been flogged at the gangway; yet, in relating\r\nthe story of the Battle of Navarino, he plainly showed that he held the\r\nGod of the blessed Bible to have been the British Commodore in the\r\nLevant, on the bloody 20th of October, A. D. 1827. And thus it would\r\nseem that war almost makes blasphemers of the best of men, and brings\r\nthem all down to the Feejee standard of humanity. Some man-of-war’s-men\r\nhave confessed to me, that as a battle has raged more and more, their\r\nhearts have hardened in infernal harmony; and, like their own guns,\r\nthey have fought without a thought.\r\n\r\nSoldier or sailor, the fighting man is but a fiend; and the staff and\r\nbody-guard of the Devil musters many a baton. But war at times is\r\ninevitable. Must the national honour be trampled under foot by an\r\ninsolent foe?\r\n\r\nSay on, say on; but know you this, and lay it to heart, war-voting\r\nBench of Bishops, that He on whom we believe _himself_ has enjoined us\r\nto turn the left cheek if the right be smitten. Never mind what\r\nfollows. That passage you can not expunge from the Bible; that passage\r\nis as binding upon us as any other; that passage embodies the soul and\r\nsubstance of the Christian faith; without it, Christianity were like\r\nany other faith. And that passage will yet, by the blessing of God,\r\nturn the world. But in some things we must turn Quakers first.\r\n\r\nBut though unlike most scenes of carnage, which have proved useless\r\nmurders of men, Admiral Codrington’s victory undoubtedly achieved the\r\nemancipation of Greece, and terminated the Turkish atrocities in that\r\ntomahawked state, yet who shall lift his hand and swear that a Divine\r\nProvidence led the van of the combined fleets of England, France, and\r\nRussia at the battle of Navarino? For if this be so, then it led the\r\nvan against the Church’s own elect—the persecuted Waldenses in\r\nSwitzerland—and kindled the Smithfield fires in bloody Mary’s time.\r\n\r\nBut all events are mixed in a fusion indistinguishable. What we call\r\nFate is even, heartless, and impartial; not a fiend to kindle bigot\r\nflames, nor a philanthropist to espouse the cause of Greece. We may\r\nfret, fume, and fight; but the thing called Fate everlastingly sustains\r\nan armed neutrality.\r\n\r\nYet though all this be so, nevertheless, in our own hearts, we mould\r\nthe whole world’s hereafters; and in our own hearts we fashion our own\r\ngods. Each mortal casts his vote for whom he will to rule the worlds; I\r\nhave a voice that helps to shape eternity; and my volitions stir the\r\norbits of the furthest suns. In two senses, we are precisely what we\r\nworship. Ourselves are Fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\r\nTHE CHAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen wearied with the tumult and occasional contention of the gun-deck\r\nof our frigate, I have often retreated to a port-hole, and calmed\r\nmyself down by gazing broad off upon a placid sea. After the battle-din\r\nof the last two chapters, let us now do the like, and, in the\r\nsequestered fore-chains of the Neversink, tranquillise ourselves, if we\r\nmay.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the domestic communism to which the seamen in a\r\nman-of-war are condemned, and the publicity in which actions the most\r\ndiffident and retiring in their nature must be performed, there is yet\r\nan odd corner or two where you may sometimes steal away, and, for a few\r\nmoments, almost be private.\r\n\r\nChief among these places is the _chains_, to which I would sometimes\r\nhie during our pleasant homeward-bound glide over those pensive\r\ntropical latitudes. After hearing my fill of the wild yarns of our top,\r\nhere would I recline—if not disturbed—serenely concocting information\r\ninto wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe chains designates the small platform outside of the hull, at the\r\nbase of the large shrouds leading down from the three mast-heads to the\r\nbulwarks. At present they seem to be getting out of vogue among\r\nmerchant-vessels, along with the fine, old-fashioned quarter-galleries,\r\nlittle turret-like ap-purtenances, which, in the days of the old\r\nAdmirals, set off the angles of an armed ship’s stern. Here a naval\r\nofficer might lounge away an hour after action, smoking a cigar, to\r\ndrive out of his whiskers the villainous smoke of the gun-powder. The\r\npicturesque, delightful stern-gallery, also, a broad balcony\r\noverhanging the sea, and entered from the Captain’s cabin, much as you\r\nmight enter a bower from a lady’s chamber; this charming balcony,\r\nwhere, sailing over summer seas in the days of the old Peruvian\r\nviceroys, the Spanish cavalier Mendanna, of Lima, made love to the Lady\r\nIsabella, as they voyaged in quest of the Solomon Islands, the fabulous\r\nOphir, the Grand Cyclades; and the Lady Isabella, at sunset, blushed\r\nlike the Orient, and gazed down to the gold-fish and silver-hued\r\nflying-fish, that wove the woof and warp of their wakes in bright,\r\nscaly tartans and plaids underneath where the Lady reclined; this\r\ncharming balcony—exquisite retreat—has been cut away by Vandalic\r\ninnovations. Ay, that claw-footed old gallery is no longer in fashion;\r\nin Commodore’s eyes, is no longer genteel.\r\n\r\nOut on all furniture fashions but those that are past! Give me my\r\ngrandfather’s old arm-chair, planted upon four carved frogs, as the\r\nHindoos fabled the world to be supported upon four tortoises; give me\r\nhis cane, with the gold-loaded top—a cane that, like the musket of\r\nGeneral Washington’s father and the broadsword of William Wallace,\r\nwould break down the back of the switch-carrying dandies of these\r\nspindle-shank days; give me his broad-breasted vest, coming bravely\r\ndown over the hips, and furnished with two strong-boxes of pockets to\r\nkeep guineas in; toss this toppling cylinder of a beaver overboard, and\r\ngive me my grandfather’s gallant, gable-ended, cocked hat.\r\n\r\nBut though the quarter-galleries and the stern-gallery of a man-of-war\r\nare departed, yet the _chains_ still linger; nor can there be imagined\r\na more agreeable retreat. The huge blocks and lanyards forming the\r\npedestals of the shrouds divide the chains into numerous little\r\nchapels, alcoves, niches, and altars, where you lazily lounge—outside\r\nof the ship, though on board. But there are plenty to divide a good\r\nthing with you in this man-of-war world. Often, when snugly seated in\r\none of these little alcoves, gazing off to the horizon, and thinking of\r\nCathay, I have been startled from my repose by some old quarter-gunner,\r\nwho, having newly painted a parcel of match-tubs, wanted to set them to\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nAt other times, one of the tattooing artists would crawl over the\r\nbulwarks, followed by his sitter; and then a bare arm or leg would be\r\nextended, and the disagreeable business of “_pricking_” commence, right\r\nunder my eyes; or an irruption of tars, with ditty-bags or\r\nsea-reticules, and piles of old trowsers to mend, would break in upon\r\nmy seclusion, and, forming a sewing-circle, drive me off with their\r\nchatter.\r\n\r\nBut once—it was a Sunday afternoon—I was pleasantly reclining in a\r\nparticularly shady and secluded little niche between two lanyards, when\r\nI heard a low, supplicating voice. Peeping through the narrow space\r\nbetween the ropes, I perceived an aged seaman on his knees, his face\r\nturned seaward, with closed eyes, buried in prayer. Softly rising, I\r\nstole through a port-hole, and left the venerable worshipper alone.\r\n\r\nHe was a sheet-anchor-man, an earnest Baptist, and was well known, in\r\nhis own part of the ship, to be constant in his solitary devotions in\r\nthe _chains_. He reminded me of St. Anthony going out into the\r\nwilderness to pray.\r\n\r\nThis man was captain of the starboard bow-chaser, one of the two long\r\ntwenty-four-pounders on the forecastle. In time of action, the command\r\nof that iron Thalaba the Destroyer would devolve upon _him_. It would\r\nbe his business to “train” it properly; to see it well loaded; the\r\ngrape and cannister rammed home; also, to “prick the cartridge,” “take\r\nthe sight,” and give the word for the match-man to apply his wand;\r\nbidding a sudden hell to flash forth from the muzzle, in wide\r\ncombustion and death.\r\n\r\nNow, this captain of the bow-chaser was an upright old man, a sincere,\r\nhumble believer, and he but earned his bread in being captain of that\r\ngun; but how, with those hands of his begrimed with powder, could he\r\nbreak that _other_ and most peaceful and penitent bread of the Supper?\r\nthough in that hallowed sacrament, it seemed, he had often partaken\r\nashore. The omission of this rite in a man-of-war—though there is a\r\nchaplain to preside over it, and at least a few communicants to\r\npartake—must be ascribed to a sense of religious propriety, in the last\r\ndegree to be commended.\r\n\r\nAh! the best righteousness of our man-of-war world seems but an\r\nunrealised ideal, after all; and those maxims which, in the hope of\r\nbringing about a Millennium, we busily teach to the heathen, we\r\nChristians ourselves disregard. In view of the whole present social\r\nframe-work of our world, so ill adapted to the practical adoption of\r\nthe meekness of Christianity, there seems almost some ground for the\r\nthought, that although our blessed Saviour was full of the wisdom of\r\nheaven, yet his gospel seems lacking in the practical wisdom of\r\nearth—in a due appreciation of the necessities of nations at times\r\ndemanding bloody massacres and wars; in a proper estimation of the\r\nvalue of rank, title, and money. But all this only the more crowns the\r\ndivine consistency of Jesus; since Burnet and the best theologians\r\ndemonstrate, that his nature was not merely human—was not that of a\r\nmere man of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\r\nTHE HOSPITAL IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter running with a fine steady breeze up to the Line, it fell calm,\r\nand there we lay, three days enchanted on the sea. We were a most\r\npuissant man-of-war, no doubt, with our five hundred men, Commodore and\r\nCaptain, backed by our long batteries of thirty-two and twenty-four\r\npounders; yet, for all that, there we lay rocking, helpless as an\r\ninfant in the cradle. Had it only been a gale instead of a calm, gladly\r\nwould we have charged upon it with our gallant bowsprit, as with a\r\nstout lance in rest; but, as with man-kind, this serene, passive\r\nfoe—unresisting and irresistible—lived it out, unconquered to the last.\r\n\r\nAll these three days the heat was excessive; the sun drew the tar from\r\nthe seams of the ship; the awnings were spread fore and aft; the decks\r\nwere kept constantly sprinkled with water. It was during this period\r\nthat a sad event occurred, though not an unusual one on shipboard. But\r\nin order to prepare for its narration, some account of a part of the\r\nship called the “_sick-bay_” must needs be presented.\r\n\r\nThe “_sick-bay_” is that part of a man-of-war where the invalid seamen\r\nare placed; in many respects it answers to a public hospital ashore. As\r\nwith most frigates, the sick-bay of the Neversink was on the\r\nberth-deck—the third deck from above. It was in the extreme forward\r\npart of that deck, embracing the triangular area in the bows of the\r\nship. It was, therefore, a subterranean vault, into which scarce a ray\r\nof heaven’s glad light ever penetrated, even at noon.\r\n\r\nIn a sea-going frigate that has all her armament and stores on board,\r\nthe floor of the berth-deck is partly below the surface of the water.\r\nBut in a smooth harbour, some circulation of air is maintained by\r\nopening large auger-holes in the upper portion of the sides, called\r\n“air-ports,” not much above the water level. Before going to sea,\r\nhowever, these air-ports must be closed, caulked, and the seams\r\nhermetically sealed with pitch. These places for ventilation being\r\nshut, the sick-bay is entirely barred against the free, natural\r\nadmission of fresh air. In the Neversink a few lungsful were forced\r\ndown by artificial means. But as the ordinary _wind-sail_ was the only\r\nmethod adopted, the quantity of fresh air sent down was regulated by\r\nthe force of the wind. In a calm there was none to be had, while in a\r\nsevere gale the wind-sail had to be hauled up, on account of the\r\nviolent draught flowing full upon the cots of the sick. An open-work\r\npartition divided our sick-bay from the rest of the deck, where the\r\nhammocks of the watch were slung; it, therefore, was exposed to all the\r\nuproar that ensued upon the watches being relieved.\r\n\r\nAn official, called the surgeon’s steward, assisted by subordinates,\r\npresided over the place. He was the same individual alluded to as\r\nofficiating at the amputation of the top-man. He was always to be found\r\nat his post, by night and by day.\r\n\r\nThis surgeon’s steward deserves a description. He was a small, pale,\r\nhollow-eyed young man, with that peculiar Lazarus-like expression so\r\noften noticed in hospital attendants. Seldom or never did you see him\r\non deck, and when he _did_ emerge into the light of the sun, it was\r\nwith an abashed look, and an uneasy, winking eye. The sun was not made\r\nfor _him_. His nervous organization was confounded by the sight of the\r\nrobust old sea-dogs on the forecastle and the general tumult of the\r\nspar-deck, and he mostly buried himself below in an atmosphere which\r\nlong habit had made congenial.\r\n\r\nThis young man never indulged in frivolous conversation; he only talked\r\nof the surgeon’s prescriptions; his every word was a bolus. He never\r\nwas known to smile; nor did he even look sober in the ordinary way; but\r\nhis countenance ever wore an aspect of cadaverous resignation to his\r\nfate. Strange! that so many of those who would fain minister to our own\r\nhealth should look so much like invalids themselves.\r\n\r\nConnected with the sick-bay, over which the surgeon’s steward\r\npresided—but removed from it in place, being next door to the\r\ncounting-room of the purser’s steward—was a regular apothecary’s shop,\r\nof which he kept the key. It was fitted up precisely like an\r\napothecary’s on shore, displaying tiers of shelves on all four sides\r\nfilled with green bottles and gallipots; beneath were multitudinous\r\ndrawers bearing incomprehensible gilded inscriptions in abbreviated\r\nLatin.\r\n\r\nHe generally opened his shop for an hour or two every morning and\r\nevening. There was a Venetian blind in the upper part of the door,\r\nwhich he threw up when inside so as to admit a little air. And there\r\nyou would see him, with a green shade over his eyes, seated on a stool,\r\nand pounding his pestle in a great iron mortar that looked like a\r\nhowitzer, mixing some jallapy compound. A smoky lamp shed a flickering,\r\nyellow-fever tinge upon his pallid face and the closely-packed\r\nregiments of gallipots.\r\n\r\nSeveral times when I felt in need of a little medicine, but was not ill\r\nenough to report myself to the surgeon at his levees, I would call of a\r\nmorning upon his steward at the Sign of the Mortar, and beg him to give\r\nme what I wanted; when, without speaking a word, this cadaverous young\r\nman would mix me my potion in a tin cup, and hand it out through the\r\nlittle opening in his door, like the boxed-up treasurer giving you your\r\nchange at the ticket-office of a theatre.\r\n\r\nBut there was a little shelf against the wall of the door, and upon\r\nthis I would set the tin cup for a while, and survey it; for I never\r\nwas a Julius Caesar at taking medicine; and to take it in this way,\r\nwithout a single attempt at disguising it; with no counteracting little\r\nmorsel to hurry down after it; in short to go to the very apothecary’s\r\nin person, and there, at the counter, swallow down your dose, as if it\r\nwere a nice mint-julep taken at the bar of a hotel—_this_ was a bitter\r\nbolus indeed. But, then, this pallid young apothecary charged nothing\r\nfor it, and _that_ was no small satisfaction; for is it not remarkable,\r\nto say the least, that a shore apothecary should actually charge you\r\nmoney—round dollars and cents—for giving you a horrible nausea?\r\n\r\nMy tin cup would wait a long time on that little shelf; yet “Pills,” as\r\nthe sailors called him, never heeded my lingering, but in sober, silent\r\nsadness continued pounding his mortar or folding up his powders; until\r\nat last some other customer would appear, and then in a sudden frenzy\r\nof resolution, I would gulp down my sherry-cobbler, and carry its\r\nunspeakable flavour with me far up into the frigate’s main-top. I do\r\nnot know whether it was the wide roll of the ship, as felt in that\r\ngiddy perch, that occasioned it, but I always got sea-sick after taking\r\nmedicine and going aloft with it. Seldom or never did it do me any\r\nlasting good.\r\n\r\nNow the Surgeon’s steward was only a subordinate of Surgeon Cuticle\r\nhimself, who lived in the ward-room among the Lieutenants,\r\nSailing-master, Chaplain, and Purser.\r\n\r\nThe Surgeon is, by law, charged with the business of overlooking the\r\ngeneral sanitary affairs of the ship. If anything is going on in any of\r\nits departments which he judges to be detrimental to the healthfulness\r\nof the crew, he has a right to protest against it formally to the\r\nCaptain. When a man is being scourged at the gangway, the Surgeon\r\nstands by; and if he thinks that the punishment is becoming more than\r\nthe culprit’s constitution can well bear, he has a right to interfere\r\nand demand its cessation for the time.\r\n\r\nBut though the Navy regulations nominally vest him with this high\r\ndiscretionary authority over the very Commodore himself, how seldom\r\ndoes he exercise it in cases where humanity demands it? Three years is\r\na long time to spend in one ship, and to be at swords’ points with its\r\nCaptain and Lieutenants during such a period, must be very unsocial and\r\nevery way irksome. No otherwise than thus, at least, can the remissness\r\nof some surgeons in remonstrating against cruelty be accounted for.\r\n\r\nNot to speak again of the continual dampness of the decks consequent\r\nupon flooding them with salt water, when we were driving near to Cape\r\nHorn, it needs only to be mentioned that, on board of the Neversink,\r\nmen known to be in consumptions gasped under the scourge of the\r\nboatswain’s mate, when the Surgeon and his two attendants stood by and\r\nnever interposed. But where the unscrupulousness of martial discipline\r\nis maintained, it is in vain to attempt softening its rigour by the\r\nordaining of humanitarian laws. Sooner might you tame the grizzly bear\r\nof Missouri than humanise a thing so essentially cruel and heartless.\r\n\r\nBut the Surgeon has yet other duties to perform. Not a seaman enters\r\nthe Navy without undergoing a corporal examination, to test his\r\nsoundness in wind and limb.\r\n\r\nOne of the first places into which I was introduced when I first\r\nentered on board the Neversink was the sick-bay, where I found one of\r\nthe Assistant Surgeons seated at a green-baize table. It was his turn\r\nfor visiting the apartment. Having been commanded by the deck officer\r\nto report my business to the functionary before me, I accordingly\r\nhemmed, to attract his attention, and then catching his eye, politely\r\nintimated that I called upon him for the purpose of being accurately\r\nlaid out and surveyed.\r\n\r\n“Strip!” was the answer, and, rolling up his gold-laced cuff, he\r\nproceeded to manipulate me. He punched me in the ribs, smote me across\r\nthe chest, commanded me to stand on one leg and hold out the other\r\nhorizontally. He asked me whether any of my family were consumptive;\r\nwhether I ever felt a tendency to a rush of blood to the head; whether\r\nI was gouty; how often I had been bled during my life; how long I had\r\nbeen ashore; how long I had been afloat; with several other questions\r\nwhich have altogether slipped my memory. He concluded his\r\ninterrogatories with this extraordinary and unwarranted one—“Are you\r\npious?”\r\n\r\nIt was a leading question which somewhat staggered me, but I said not a\r\nword; when, feeling of my calves, he looked up and incomprehensibly\r\nsaid, “I am afraid you are not.”\r\n\r\nAt length he declared me a sound animal, and wrote a certificate to\r\nthat effect, with which I returned to the deck.\r\n\r\nThis Assistant Surgeon turned out to be a very singular character, and\r\nwhen I became more acquainted with him, I ceased to marvel at the\r\ncurious question with which he had concluded his examination of my\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nHe was a thin, knock-kneed man, with a sour, saturnine expression,\r\nrendered the more peculiar from his shaving his beard so remorselessly,\r\nthat his chin and cheeks always looked blue, as if pinched with cold.\r\nHis long familiarity with nautical invalids seemed to have filled him\r\nfull of theological hypoes concerning the state of their souls. He was\r\nat once the physician and priest of the sick, washing down his boluses\r\nwith ghostly consolation, and among the sailors went by the name of The\r\nPelican, a fowl whose hanging pouch imparts to it a most chop-fallen,\r\nlugubrious expression.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of going off duty and lying by when you are sick, is one\r\nof the few points in which a man-of-war is far better for the sailor\r\nthan a merchantman. But, as with every other matter in the Navy, the\r\nwhole thing is subject to the general discipline of the vessel, and is\r\nconducted with a severe, unyielding method and regularity, making no\r\nallowances for exceptions to rules.\r\n\r\nDuring the half-hour preceding morning quarters, the Surgeon of a\r\nfrigate is to be found in the sick-bay, where, after going his rounds\r\namong the invalids, he holds a levee for the benefit of all new\r\ncandidates for the sick-list. If, after looking at your tongue, and\r\nfeeling of your pulse, he pronounces you a proper candidate, his\r\nsecretary puts you down on his books, and you are thenceforth relieved\r\nfrom all duty, and have abundant leisure in which to recover your\r\nhealth. Let the boatswain blow; let the deck officer bellow; let the\r\ncaptain of your gun hunt you up; yet, if it can be answered by your\r\nmess-mates that you are “_down on the list_,” you ride it all out with\r\nimpunity. The Commodore himself has then no authority over you. But you\r\nmust not be too much elated, for your immunities are only secure while\r\nyou are immured in the dark hospital below. Should you venture to get a\r\nmouthful of fresh air on the spar-deck, and be there discovered by an\r\nofficer, you will in vain plead your illness; for it is quite\r\nimpossible, it seems, that any true man-of-war invalid can be hearty\r\nenough to crawl up the ladders. Besides, the raw sea air, as they will\r\ntell you, is not good for the sick.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding all this, notwithstanding the darkness and\r\ncloseness of the sick-bay, in which an alleged invalid must be content\r\nto shut himself up till the Surgeon pronounces him cured, many\r\ninstances occur, especially in protracted bad weather, where pretended\r\ninvalids will submit to this dismal hospital durance, in order to\r\nescape hard work and wet jackets.\r\n\r\nThere is a story told somewhere of the Devil taking down the\r\nconfessions of a woman on a strip of parchment, and being obliged to\r\nstretch it longer and longer with his teeth, in order to find room for\r\nall the lady had to say. Much thus was it with our Purser’s steward,\r\nwho had to lengthen out his manuscript sick-list, in order to\r\naccommodate all the names which were presented to him while we were off\r\nthe pitch of Cape Horn. What sailors call the “_Cape Horn fever_,”\r\nalarmingly prevailed; though it disappeared altogether when we got into\r\nthe weather, which, as with many other invalids, was solely to be\r\nimputed to the wonder-working effects of an entire change of climate.\r\n\r\nIt seems very strange, but it is really true, that off Cape Horn some\r\n“_sogers_” of sailors will stand cupping, and bleeding, and blistering,\r\nbefore they will budge. On the other hand, there are cases where a man\r\nactually sick and in need of medicine will refuse to go on the\r\nsick-list, because in that case his allowance of _grog_ must be\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nOn board of every American man-of-war, bound for sea, there is a goodly\r\nsupply of wines and various delicacies put on board—according to\r\nlaw—for the benefit of the sick, whether officers or sailors. And one\r\nof the chicken-coops is always reserved for the Government chickens,\r\ndestined for a similar purpose. But, on board of the Neversink, the\r\nonly delicacies given to invalid sailors was a little sago or\r\narrow-root, and they did not get _that_ unless severely ill; but, so\r\nfar as I could learn, no wine, in any quantity, was ever prescribed for\r\nthem, though the Government bottles often went into the ward-room, for\r\nthe benefit of indisposed officers.\r\n\r\nAnd though the Government chicken-coop was replenished at every port,\r\nyet not four pair of drum-sticks were ever boiled into broth for sick\r\nsailors. Where the chickens went, some one must have known; but, as I\r\ncannot vouch for it myself, I will not here back the hardy assertion of\r\nthe men, which was that the pious Pelican—true to his name—was\r\nextremely fond of poultry. I am the still less disposed to believe this\r\nscandal, from the continued leanness of the Pelican, which could hardly\r\nhave been the case did he nourish himself by so nutritious a dish as\r\nthe drum-sticks of fowls, a diet prescribed to pugilists in training.\r\nBut who can avoid being suspicious of a very suspicious person?\r\nPelican! I rather suspect you still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\nDISMAL TIMES IN THE MESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on the first day of the long, hot calm which we had on the\r\nEquator, that a mess-mate of mine, by the name of Shenly, who had been\r\nfor some weeks complaining, at length went on the sick-list.\r\n\r\nAn old gunner’s mate of the mess—Priming, the man with the hare-lip,\r\nwho, true to his tribe, was charged to the muzzle with bile, and,\r\nmoreover, rammed home on top of it a wad of sailor superstition—this\r\ngunner’s mate indulged in some gloomy and savage remarks—strangely\r\ntinged with genuine feeling and grief—at the announcement of the\r\nsickness of Shenly, coming as it did not long after the almost fatal\r\naccident befalling poor Baldy, captain of the mizzen-top, another\r\nmess-mate of ours, and the dreadful fate of the amputated fore-top-man\r\nwhom we buried in Rio, also our mess-mate.\r\n\r\nWe were cross-legged seated at dinner, between the guns, when the sad\r\nnews concerning Shenly was first communicated.\r\n\r\n“I know’d it, I know’d it,” said Priming, through his nose. “Blast ye,\r\nI told ye so; poor fellow! But dam’me, I know’d it. This comes of\r\nhaving _thirteen_ in the mess. I hope he arn’t dangerous, men? Poor\r\nShenly! But, blast it, it warn’t till White-Jacket there comed into the\r\nmess that these here things began. I don’t believe there’ll be more nor\r\nthree of us left by the time we strike soundings, men. But how is he\r\nnow? Have you been down to see him, any on ye? Damn you, you Jonah! I\r\ndon’t see how you can sleep in your hammock, knowing as you do that by\r\nmaking an odd number in the mess you have been the death of one poor\r\nfellow, and ruined Baldy for life, and here’s poor Shenly keeled up.\r\nBlast you, and your jacket, say I.”\r\n\r\n“My dear mess-mate,” I cried, “don’t blast me any more, for Heaven’s\r\nsale. Blast my jacket you may, and I’ll join you in _that;_ but don’t\r\nblast _me;_ for if you do, I shouldn’t wonder if I myself was the next\r\nman to keel up.”\r\n\r\n“Gunner’s mate!” said Jack Chase, helping himself to a slice of beef,\r\nand sandwiching it between two large biscuits—“Gunner’s mate!\r\nWhite-Jacket there is my particular friend, and I would take it as a\r\nparticular favour if you would _knock off_ blasting him. It’s in bad\r\ntaste, rude, and unworthy a gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Take your back away from that ’ere gun-carriage, will ye now, Jack\r\nChase?” cried Priming, in reply, just then Jack happening to lean up\r\nagainst it. “Must I be all the time cleaning after you fellows? Blast\r\nye! I spent an hour on that ’ere gun-carriage this very mornin’. But it\r\nall comes of White-Jacket there. If it warn’t for having one too many,\r\nthere wouldn’t be any crowding and jamming in the mess. I’m blessed if\r\nwe ar’n’t about chock a’ block here! Move further up there, I’m sitting\r\non my leg!”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, gunner’s mate,” cried I, “if it will content you, I\r\nand my jacket will leave the mess.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you would, and be —— to you!” he replied.\r\n\r\n“And if he does, you will mess alone, gunner’s mate,” said Jack Chase.\r\n\r\n“That you will,” cried all.\r\n\r\n“And I wish to the Lord you’d let me!” growled Priming, irritably\r\nrubbing his head with the handle of his sheath-knife.\r\n\r\n“You are an old bear, gunner’s mate,” said Jack Chase.\r\n\r\n“I am an old Turk,” he replied, drawing the flat blade of his knife\r\nbetween his teeth, thereby producing a whetting, grating sound.\r\n\r\n“Let him alone, let him alone, men,” said Jack Chase. “Only keep off\r\nthe tail of a rattlesnake, and he’ll not rattle.”\r\n\r\n“Look out he don’t bite, though,” said Priming, snapping his teeth; and\r\nwith that he rolled off, growling as he went.\r\n\r\nThough I did my best to carry off my vexation with an air of\r\nindifference, need I say how I cursed my jacket, that it thus seemed\r\nthe means of fastening on me the murder of one of my shipmates, and the\r\nprobable murder of two more. For, had it not been for my jacket,\r\ndoubtless, I had yet been a member of my old mess, and so have escaped\r\nmaking the luckless odd number among my present companions.\r\n\r\nAll I could say in private to Priming had no effect; though I often\r\ntook him aside, to convince him of the philosophical impossibility of\r\nmy having been accessary to the misfortunes of Baldy, the buried sailor\r\nin Rio, and Shenly. But Priming knew better; nothing could move him;\r\nand he ever afterward eyed me as virtuous citizens do some notorious\r\nunderhand villain going unhung of justice.\r\n\r\nJacket! jacket! thou hast much to answer for, jacket!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\r\nHOW MAN-OF-WAR’S-MEN DIE AT SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nShenly, my sick mess-mate, was a middle-aged, handsome, intelligent\r\nseaman, whom some hard calamity, or perhaps some unfortunate excess,\r\nmust have driven into the Navy. He told me he had a wife and two\r\nchildren in Portsmouth, in the state of New Hampshire. Upon being\r\nexamined by Cuticle, the surgeon, he was, on purely scientific grounds,\r\nreprimanded by that functionary for not having previously appeared\r\nbefore him. He was immediately consigned to one of the invalid cots as\r\na serious case. His complaint was of long standing; a pulmonary one,\r\nnow attended with general prostration.\r\n\r\nThe same evening he grew so much worse, that according to man-of-war\r\nusage, we, his mess-mates, were officially notified that we must take\r\nturns at sitting up with him through the night. We at once made our\r\narrangements, allotting two hours for a watch. Not till the third night\r\ndid my own turn come round. During the day preceding, it was stated at\r\nthe mess that our poor mess-mate was run down completely; the surgeon\r\nhad given him up.\r\n\r\nAt four bells (two o’clock in the morning), I went down to relieve one\r\nof my mess-mates at the sick man’s cot. The profound quietude of the\r\ncalm pervaded the entire frigate through all her decks. The watch on\r\nduty were dozing on the carronade-slides, far above the sick-bay; and\r\nthe watch below were fast asleep in their hammocks, on the same deck\r\nwith the invalid.\r\n\r\nGroping my way under these two hundred sleepers, I entered the\r\nhospital. A dim lamp was burning on the table, which was screwed down\r\nto the floor. This light shed dreary shadows over the white-washed\r\nwalls of the place, making it look look a whited sepulchre underground.\r\nThe wind-sail had collapsed, and lay motionless on the deck. The low\r\ngroans of the sick were the only sounds to be heard; and as I advanced,\r\nsome of them rolled upon me their sleepless, silent, tormented eyes.\r\n\r\n“Fan him, and keep his forehead wet with this sponge,” whispered my\r\nmess-mate, whom I came to relieve, as I drew near to Shenly’s cot, “and\r\nwash the foam from his mouth; nothing more can be done for him. If he\r\ndies before your watch is out, call the Surgeon’s steward; he sleeps in\r\nthat hammock,” pointing it out. “Good-bye, good-bye, mess-mate,” he\r\nthen whispered, stooping over the sick man; and so saying, he left the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nShenly was lying on his back. His eyes were closed, forming two\r\ndark-blue pits in his face; his breath was coming and going with a\r\nslow, long-drawn, mechanical precision. It was the mere foundering hull\r\nof a man that was before me; and though it presented the well-known\r\nfeatures of my mess-mate, yet I knew that the living soul of Shenly\r\nnever more would look out of those eyes.\r\n\r\nSo warm had it been during the day, that the Surgeon himself, when\r\nvisiting the sick-bay, had entered it in his shirt-sleeves; and so warm\r\nwas now the night that even in the lofty top I had worn but a loose\r\nlinen frock and trowsers. But in this subterranean sick-bay, buried in\r\nthe very bowels of the ship, and at sea cut off from all ventilation,\r\nthe heat of the night calm was intense. The sweat dripped from me as if\r\nI had just emerged from a bath; and stripping myself naked to the\r\nwaist, I sat by the side of the cot, and with a bit of crumpled\r\npaper—put into my hand by the sailor I had relieved—kept fanning the\r\nmotionless white face before me.\r\n\r\nI could not help thinking, as I gazed, whether this man’s fate had not\r\nbeen accelerated by his confinement in this heated furnace below; and\r\nwhether many a sick man round me might not soon improve, if but\r\npermitted to swing his hammock in the airy vacancies of the half-deck\r\nabove, open to the port-holes, but reserved for the promenade of the\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nAt last the heavy breathing grew more and more irregular, and gradually\r\ndying away, left forever the unstirring form of Shenly.\r\n\r\nCalling the Surgeon’s steward, he at once told me to rouse the\r\nmaster-at-arms, and four or five of my mess-mates. The master-at-arms\r\napproached, and immediately demanded the dead man’s bag, which was\r\naccordingly dragged into the bay. Having been laid on the floor, and\r\nwashed with a bucket of water which I drew from the ocean, the body was\r\nthen dressed in a white frock, trowsers, and neckerchief, taken out of\r\nthe bag. While this was going on, the master-at-arms—standing over the\r\noperation with his rattan, and directing myself and mess-mates—indulged\r\nin much discursive levity, intended to manifest his fearlessness of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nPierre, who had been a “_chummy_” of Shenly’s, spent much time in tying\r\nthe neckerchief in an elaborate bow, and affectionately adjusting the\r\nwhite frock and trowsers; but the master-at-arms put an end to this by\r\nordering us to carry the body up to the gun-deck. It was placed on the\r\ndeath-board (used for that purpose), and we proceeded with it toward\r\nthe main hatchway, awkwardly crawling under the tiers of hammocks,\r\nwhere the entire watch-below was sleeping. As, unavoidably, we rocked\r\ntheir pallets, the man-of-war’s-men would cry out against us; through\r\nthe mutterings of curses, the corpse reached the hatchway. Here the\r\nboard slipped, and some time was spent in readjusting the body. At\r\nlength we deposited it on the gun-deck, between two guns, and a\r\nunion-jack being thrown over it for a pall, I was left again to watch\r\nby its side.\r\n\r\nI had not been seated on my shot-box three minutes, when the\r\nmessenger-boy passed me on his way forward; presently the slow, regular\r\nstroke of the ship’s great bell was heard, proclaiming through the calm\r\nthe expiration of the watch; it was four o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nPoor Shenly! thought I, that sounds like your knell! and here you lie\r\nbecalmed, in the last calm of all!\r\n\r\nHardly had the brazen din died away, when the Boatswain and his mates\r\nmustered round the hatchway, within a yard or two of the corpse, and\r\nthe usual thundering call was given for the watch below to turn out.\r\n\r\n“All the starboard-watch, ahoy! On deck there, below! Wide awake there,\r\nsleepers!”\r\n\r\nBut the dreamless sleeper by my side, who had so often sprung from his\r\nhammock at that summons, moved not a limb; the blue sheet over him lay\r\nunwrinkled.\r\n\r\nA mess-mate of the other watch now came to relieve me; but I told him I\r\nchose to remain where I was till daylight came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXX.\r\nTHE LAST STITCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust before daybreak, two of the sail-maker’s gang drew near, each with\r\na lantern, carrying some canvas, two large shot, needles, and twine. I\r\nknew their errand; for in men-of-war the sail-maker is the undertaker.\r\n\r\nThey laid the body on deck, and, after fitting the canvas to it, seated\r\nthemselves, cross-legged like tailors, one on each side, and, with\r\ntheir lanterns before them, went to stitching away, as if mending an\r\nold sail. Both were old men, with grizzled hair and beard, and shrunken\r\nfaces. They belonged to that small class of aged seamen who, for their\r\nprevious long and faithful services, are retained in the Navy more as\r\npensioners upon its merited bounty than anything else. They are set to\r\nlight and easy duties.\r\n\r\n“Ar’n’t this the fore-top-man, Shenly?” asked the foremost, looking\r\nfull at the frozen face before him.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, old Ringrope,” said the other, drawing his hand far back with\r\na long thread, “I thinks it’s him; and he’s further aloft now, I hope,\r\nthan ever he was at the fore-truck. But I only hopes; I’m afeard this\r\nar’n’t the last on him!”\r\n\r\n“His hull here will soon be going out of sight below hatches, though,\r\nold Thrummings,” replied Ringrope, placing two heavy cannon-balls in\r\nthe foot of the canvas shroud.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that, old man; I never yet sewed up a ship-mate but he\r\nspooked me arterward. I tell ye, Ring-rope, these ’ere corpses is\r\ncunning. You think they sinks deep, but they comes up again as soon as\r\nyou sails over ’em. They lose the number of their mess, and their\r\nmess-mates sticks the spoons in the rack; but no good—no good, old\r\nRingrope; they ar’n’t dead yet. I tell ye, now, ten best—bower-anchors\r\nwouldn’t sink this ’ere top-man. He’ll be soon coming in the wake of\r\nthe thirty-nine spooks what spooks me every night in my hammock—jist\r\nafore the mid-watch is called. Small thanks I gets for my pains; and\r\nevery one on ’em looks so ’proachful-like, with a sail-maker’s needle\r\nthrough his nose. I’ve been thinkin’, old Ringrope, it’s all wrong that\r\n’ere last stitch we takes. Depend on’t, they don’t like it—none on\r\n’em.”\r\n\r\nI was standing leaning over a gun, gazing at the two old men. The last\r\nremark reminded me of a superstitious custom generally practised by\r\nmost sea-undertakers upon these occasions. I resolved that, if I could\r\nhelp it, it should not take place upon the remains of Shenly.\r\n\r\n“Thrummings,” said I, advancing to the last speaker, “you are right.\r\nThat last thing you do to the canvas is the very reason, be sure of it,\r\nthat brings the ghosts after you, as you say. So don’t do it to this\r\npoor fellow, I entreat. Try once, now, how it goes not to do it.”\r\n\r\n“What do you say to the youngster, old man?” said Thrummings, holding\r\nup his lantern into his comrade’s wrinkled face, as if deciphering some\r\nancient parchment.\r\n\r\n“I’m agin all innowations,” said Ringrope; “it’s a good old fashion,\r\nthat last stitch; it keeps ’em snug, d’ye see, youngster. I’m blest if\r\nthey could sleep sound, if it wa’n’t for that. No, no, Thrummings! no\r\ninnowations; I won’t hear on’t. I goes for the last stitch!”\r\n\r\n“S’pose you was going to be sewed up yourself, old Ringrope, would you\r\nlike the last stitch then! You are an old, gun, Ringrope; you can’t\r\nstand looking out at your port-hole much longer,” said Thrummings, as\r\nhis own palsied hands were quivering over the canvas.\r\n\r\n“Better say that to yourself, old man,” replied Ringrope, stooping\r\nclose to the light to thread his coarse needle, which trembled in his\r\nwithered hands like the needle, in a compass of a Greenland ship near\r\nthe Pole. “You ain’t long for the sarvice. I wish I could give you some\r\no’ the blood in my veins, old man!”\r\n\r\n“Ye ain’t got ne’er a teaspoonful to spare,” said Thrummings. “It will\r\ngo hard, and I wouldn’t want to do it; but I’m afeard I’ll have the\r\nsewing on ye up afore long!”\r\n\r\n“Sew me up? Me dead and you alive, old man?” shrieked Ringrope. “Well,\r\nI’ve he’rd the parson of the old Independence say as how old age was\r\ndeceitful; but I never seed it so true afore this blessed night. I’m\r\nsorry for ye, old man—to see you so innocent-like, and Death all the\r\nwhile turning in and out with you in your hammock, for all the world\r\nlike a hammock-mate.”\r\n\r\n“You lie! old man,” cried Thrummings, shaking with rage. “It’s _you_\r\nthat have Death for a hammock-mate; it’s _you_ that will make a hole in\r\nthe shot-locker soon.”\r\n\r\n“Take that back!” cried Ringrope, huskily, leaning far over the corpse,\r\nand, needle in hand, menacing his companion with his aguish fist. “Take\r\nthat back, or I’ll throttle your lean bag of wind fer ye!”\r\n\r\n“Blast ye! old chaps, ain’t ye any more manners than to be fighting\r\nover a dead man?” cried one of the sail-maker’s mates, coming down from\r\nthe spar-deck. “Bear a hand!—bear a hand! and get through with that\r\njob!”\r\n\r\n“Only one more stitch to take,” muttered Ringrope, creeping near the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Drop your ‘_palm_,’ then and let Thrummings take it; follow me—the\r\nfoot of the main-sail wants mending—must do it afore a breeze springs\r\nup. D’ye hear, old chap! I say, drop your _palm_, and follow me.”\r\n\r\nAt the reiterated command of his superior, Ringrope rose, and, turning\r\nto his comrade, said, “I take it all back, Thrummings, and I’m sorry\r\nfor it, too. But mind ye, take that ’ere last stitch, now; if ye don’t,\r\nthere’s no tellin’ the consekenses.”\r\n\r\nAs the mate and his man departed, I stole up to Thrummings. “Don’t do\r\nit—don’t do it, now, Thrummings—depend on it, it’s wrong!”\r\n\r\n“Well, youngster, I’ll try this here one without it for jist this here\r\nonce; and if, arter that, he don’t spook me, I’ll be dead agin the last\r\nstitch as long as my name is Thrummings.”\r\n\r\nSo, without mutilation, the remains were replaced between the guns, the\r\nunion jack again thrown over them, and I reseated myself on the\r\nshot-box.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXI.\r\nHOW THEY BURY A MAN-OF-WAR’S-MAN AT SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuarters over in the morning, the boatswain and his four mates stood\r\nround the main hatchway, and after giving the usual whistle, made the\r\ncustomary announcement—“_All hands bury the dead, ahoy!_”\r\n\r\nIn a man-of-war, every thing, even to a man’s funeral and burial,\r\nproceeds with the unrelenting promptitude of the martial code. And\r\nwhether it is _all hands bury the dead!_ or _all hands splice the\r\nmain-brace_, the order is given in the same hoarse tones.\r\n\r\nBoth officers and men assembled in the lee waist, and through that\r\nbareheaded crowd the mess-mates of Shenly brought his body to the same\r\ngangway where it had thrice winced under the scourge. But there is\r\nsomething in death that ennobles even a pauper’s corpse; and the\r\nCaptain himself stood bareheaded before the remains of a man whom, with\r\nhis hat on, he had sentenced to the ignominious gratings when alive.\r\n\r\n“_I am the resurrection and the life!_” solemnly began the Chaplain, in\r\nfull canonicals, the prayer-book in his hand.\r\n\r\n“Damn you! off those booms!” roared a boatswain’s mate to a crowd of\r\ntop-men, who had elevated themselves to gain a better view of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n“_We commit this body to the deep!_” At the word, Shenly’s mess-mates\r\ntilted the board, and the dead sailor sank in the sea.\r\n\r\n“Look aloft,” whispered Jack Chase. “See that bird! it is the spirit of\r\nShenly.”\r\n\r\nGazing upward, all beheld a snow-white, solitary fowl, which—whence\r\ncoming no one could tell—had been hovering over the main-mast during\r\nthe service, and was now sailing far up into the depths of the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXII.\r\nWHAT REMAINS OF A MAN-OF-WAR’S-MAN AFTER HIS BURIAL AT SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon examining Shenly’s bag, a will was found, scratched in pencil,\r\nupon a blank leaf in the middle of his Bible; or, to use the phrase of\r\none of the seamen, in the midships, atween the Bible and Testament,\r\nwhere the Pothecary (Apocrypha) uses to be.\r\n\r\nThe will was comprised in one solitary sentence, exclusive of the dates\r\nand signatures: “_In case I die on the voyage, the Purser will please\r\npay over my wages to my wife, who lives in Portsmouth, New Hampshire_.”\r\n\r\nBesides the testator’s, there were two signatures of witnesses.\r\n\r\nThis last will and testament being shown to the Purser, who, it seems,\r\nhad been a notary, or surrogate, or some sort of cosy chamber\r\npractitioner in his time, he declared that it must be “proved.” So the\r\nwitnesses were called, and after recognising their hands to the paper;\r\nfor the purpose of additionally testing their honesty, they were\r\ninterrogated concerning the day on which they had signed—whether it was\r\n_Banyan Day_, or _Duff Day_, or _Swampseed Day_; for among the sailors\r\non board a man-of-war, the land terms, _Monday_, _Tuesday_,\r\n_Wednesday_, are almost unknown. In place of these they substitute\r\nnautical names, some of which are significant of the daily bill of fare\r\nat dinner for the week.\r\n\r\nThe two witnesses were somewhat puzzled by the attorney-like questions\r\nof the Purser, till a third party came along, one of the ship’s\r\nbarbers, and declared, of his own knowledge, that Shenly executed the\r\ninstrument on a _Shaving Day_; for the deceased seaman had informed him\r\nof the circumstance, when he came to have his beard reaped on the\r\nmorning of the event.\r\n\r\nIn the Purser’s opinion, this settled the question; and it is to be\r\nhoped that the widow duly received her husband’s death-earned wages.\r\n\r\nShenly was dead and gone; and what was Shenly’s epitaph?\r\n\r\n—“D. D.”—\r\n\r\nopposite his name in the Purser’s books, in “_Black’s best Writing\r\nFluid_”—funereal name and funereal hue—meaning “Discharged, Dead.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIII.\r\nA MAN-OF-WAR  COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our man-of-war world, Life comes in at one gangway and Death goes\r\noverboard at the other. Under the man-of-war scourge, curses mix with\r\ntears; and the sigh and the sob furnish the bass to the shrill octave\r\nof those who laugh to drown buried griefs of their own. Checkers were\r\nplayed in the waist at the time of Shenly’s burial; and as the body\r\nplunged, a player swept the board. The bubbles had hardly burst, when\r\nall hands were _piped down_ by the Boatswain, and the old jests were\r\nheard again, as if Shenly himself were there to hear.\r\n\r\nThis man-of-war life has not left me unhardened. I cannot stop to weep\r\nover Shenly now; that would be false to the life I depict; wearing no\r\nmourning weeds, I resume the task of portraying our man-of-war world.\r\n\r\nAmong the various other vocations, all driven abreast on board of the\r\nNeversink, was that of the schoolmaster. There were two academies in\r\nthe frigate. One comprised the apprentice boys, who, upon certain days\r\nof the week, were indoctrinated in the mysteries of the primer by an\r\ninvalid corporal of marines, a slender, wizzen-cheeked man, who had\r\nreceived a liberal infant-school education.\r\n\r\nThe other school was a far more pretentious affair—a sort of army and\r\nnavy seminary combined, where mystical mathematical problems were\r\nsolved by the midshipmen, and great ships-of-the-line were navigated\r\nover imaginary shoals by unimaginable observations of the moon and the\r\nstars, and learned lectures were delivered upon great guns, small arms,\r\nand the curvilinear lines described by bombs in the air.\r\n\r\n“_The Professor_” was the title bestowed upon the erudite gentleman who\r\nconducted this seminary, and by that title alone was he known\r\nthroughout the ship. He was domiciled in the Ward-room, and circulated\r\nthere on a social par with the Purser, Surgeon, and other\r\n_non-combatants_ and Quakers. By being advanced to the dignity of a\r\npeerage in the Ward-room, Science and Learning were ennobled in the\r\nperson of this Professor, even as divinity was honoured in the Chaplain\r\nenjoying the rank of a spiritual peer.\r\n\r\nEvery other afternoon, while at sea, the Professor assembled his pupils\r\non the half-deck, near the long twenty-four pounders. A bass drum-head\r\nwas his desk, his pupils forming a semicircle around him, seated on\r\nshot-boxes and match-tubs.\r\n\r\nThey were in the jelly of youth, and this learned Professor poured into\r\ntheir susceptible hearts all the gentle gunpowder maxims of war.\r\nPresidents of Peace Societies and Superintendents of Sabbath-schools,\r\nmust it not have been a most interesting sight?\r\n\r\nBut the Professor himself was a noteworthy person. A tall, thin,\r\nspectacled man, about forty years old, with a student’s stoop in his\r\nshoulders, and wearing uncommonly scanty pantaloons, exhibiting an\r\nundue proportion of his boots. In early life he had been a cadet in the\r\nmilitary academy of West Point; but, becoming very weak-sighted, and\r\nthereby in a good manner disqualified for active service in the field,\r\nhe had declined entering the army, and accepted the office of Professor\r\nin the Navy.\r\n\r\nHis studies at West Point had thoroughly grounded him in a knowledge of\r\ngunnery; and, as he was not a little of a pedant, it was sometimes\r\namusing, when the sailors were at quarters, to hear him criticise their\r\nevolutions at the batteries. He would quote Dr. Hutton’s Tracts on the\r\nsubject, also, in the original, “_The French Bombardier_,” and wind up\r\nby Italian passages from the “_Prattica Manuale dell’ Artiglieria_.”\r\n\r\nThough not required by the Navy regulations to instruct his scholars in\r\naught but the application of mathematics to navigation, yet besides\r\nthis, and besides instructing them in the theory of gunnery, he also\r\nsought to root them in the theory of frigate and fleet tactics. To be\r\nsure, he himself did not know how to splice a rope or furl a sail; and,\r\nowing to his partiality for strong coffee, he was apt to be nervous\r\nwhen we fired salutes; yet all this did not prevent him from delivering\r\nlectures on cannonading and “breaking the enemy’s line.”\r\n\r\nHe had arrived at his knowledge of tactics by silent, solitary study,\r\nand earnest meditation in the sequestered retreat of his state-room.\r\nHis case was somewhat parallel to the Scotchman’s—John Clerk, Esq., of\r\nEldin—who, though he had never been to sea, composed a quarto treatise\r\non fleet-fighting, which to this day remains a text-book; and he also\r\noriginated a nautical manoeuvre, which has given to England many a\r\nvictory over her foes.\r\n\r\nNow there was a large black-board, something like a great-gun\r\ntarget—only it was square—which during the professor’s lectures was\r\nplaced upright on the gun-deck, supported behind by three\r\nboarding-pikes. And here he would chalk out diagrams of great fleet\r\nengagements; making marks, like the soles of shoes, for the ships, and\r\ndrawing a dog-vane in one corner to denote the assumed direction of the\r\nwind. This done, with a cutlass he would point out every spot of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“Now, young gentlemen, the board before you exhibits the disposition of\r\nthe British West Indian squadron under Rodney, when, early on the\r\nmorning of the 9th of April, in the year of our blessed Lord 1782, he\r\ndiscovered part of the French fleet, commanded by the Count de Grasse,\r\nlying under the north end of the Island of Dominica. It was at this\r\njuncture that the Admiral gave the signal for the British line to\r\nprepare for battle, and stand on. D’ye understand, young gentlemen?\r\nWell, the British van having nearly fetched up with the centre of the\r\nenemy—who, be it remembered, were then on the starboard tack—and\r\nRodney’s centre and rear being yet becalmed under the lee of the\r\nland—the question I ask you is, What should Rodney now do?”\r\n\r\n“Blaze away, by all means!” responded a rather confident reefer, who\r\nhad zealously been observing the diagram.\r\n\r\n“But, sir, his centre and rear are still becalmed, and his van has not\r\nyet closed with the enemy.”\r\n\r\n“Wait till he _does_ come in range, and _then_ blaze away,” said the\r\nreefer.\r\n\r\n“Permit me to remark, Mr. Pert, that ‘_blaze away_’ is not a strictly\r\ntechnical term; and also permit me to hint, Mr. Pert, that you should\r\nconsider the subject rather more deeply before you hurry forward your\r\nopinion.”\r\n\r\nThis rebuke not only abashed Mr. Pert, but for a time intimidated the\r\nrest; and the professor was obliged to proceed, and extricate the\r\nBritish fleet by himself. He concluded by awarding Admiral Rodney the\r\nvictory, which must have been exceedingly gratifying to the family\r\npride of the surviving relatives and connections of that distinguished\r\nhero.\r\n\r\n“Shall I clean the board, sir?” now asked Mr. Pert, brightening up.\r\n\r\n“No, sir; not till you have saved that crippled French ship in the\r\ncorner. That ship, young gentlemen, is the Glorieuse: you perceive she\r\nis cut off from her consorts, and the whole British fleet is giving\r\nchase to her. Her bowsprit is gone; her rudder is torn away; she has\r\none hundred round shot in her hull, and two thirds of her men are dead\r\nor dying. What’s to be done? the wind being at northeast by north?”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” said Mr. Dash, a chivalric young gentleman from Virginia,\r\n“I wouldn’t strike yet; I’d nail my colours to the main-royal-mast! I\r\nwould, by Jove!”\r\n\r\n“That would not save your ship, sir; besides, your main-mast has gone\r\nby the board.”\r\n\r\n“I think, sir,” said Mr. Slim, a diffident youth, “I think, sir, I\r\nwould haul back the fore-top-sail.”\r\n\r\n“And why so? of what service would _that_ be, I should like to know,\r\nMr. Slim?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t tell exactly; but I think it would help her a little,” was the\r\ntimid reply.\r\n\r\n“Not a whit, sir—not one particle; besides, you can’t haul back your\r\nfore-top-sail—your fore-mast is lying across your forecastle.”\r\n\r\n“Haul back the main-top-sail, then,” suggested another.\r\n\r\n“Can’t be done; your main-mast, also, has gone by the board!”\r\n\r\n“Mizzen-top-sail?” meekly suggested little Boat-Plug.\r\n\r\n“Your mizzen-top-mast, let me inform you, sir, was shot down in the\r\nfirst of the fight!”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” cried Mr. Dash, “I’d tack ship, anyway; bid ’em good-by\r\nwith a broadside; nail my flag to the keel, if there was no other\r\nplace; and blow my brains out on the poop!”\r\n\r\n“Idle, idle, sir! worse than idle! you are carried away, Mr. Dash, by\r\nyour ardent Southern temperament! Let me inform you, young gentlemen,\r\nthat this ship,” touching it with his cutlass, “_cannot_ be saved.”\r\n\r\nThen, throwing down his cutlass, “Mr. Pert, have the goodness to hand\r\nme one of those cannon-balls from the rack.”\r\n\r\nBalancing the iron sphere in one hand, the learned professor began\r\nfingering it with the other, like Columbus illustrating the rotundity\r\nof the globe before the Royal Commission of Castilian Ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\n“Young gentlemen, I resume my remarks on the passage of a shot _in\r\nvacuo_, which remarks were interrupted yesterday by general quarters.\r\nAfter quoting that admirable passage in ‘Spearman’s British Gunner,’ I\r\nthen laid it down, you remember, that the path of a shot _in vacuo_\r\ndescribes a parabolic curve. I now add that, agreeably to the method\r\npursued by the illustrious Newton in treating the subject of\r\ncurvilinear motion, I consider the _trajectory_ or curve described by a\r\nmoving body in space as consisting of a series of right lines,\r\ndescribed in successive intervals of time, and constituting the\r\ndiagonals of parallelograms formed in a vertical plane between the\r\nvertical deflections caused by gravity and the production of the line\r\nof motion which has been described in each preceding interval of time.\r\nThis must be obvious; for, if you say that the passage _in vacuo_ of\r\nthis cannon-ball, now held in my hand, would describe otherwise than a\r\nseries of right lines, etc., then you are brought to the _Reductio ad\r\nAbsurdum_, that the diagonals of parallelograms are——”\r\n\r\n“All hands reef top-sail!” was now thundered forth by the boatswain’s\r\nmates. The shot fell from the professor’s palm; his spectacles dropped\r\non his nose, and the school tumultuously broke up, the pupils\r\nscrambling up the ladders with the sailors, who had been overhearing\r\nthe lecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\nMAN-OF-WAR BARBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe allusion to one of the ship’s barbers in a previous chapter,\r\ntogether with the recollection of how conspicuous a part they enacted\r\nin a tragical drama soon to be related, leads me now to introduce them\r\nto the reader.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous artists and professors of polite trades in the Navy,\r\nnone are held in higher estimation or drive a more profitable business\r\nthan these barbers. And it may well be imagined that the five hundred\r\nheads of hair and five hundred beards of a frigate should furnish no\r\nsmall employment for those to whose faithful care they may be\r\nintrusted. As everything connected with the domestic affairs of a\r\nman-of-war comes under the supervision of the martial executive, so\r\ncertain barbers are formally licensed by the First Lieutenant. The\r\nbetter to attend to the profitable duties of their calling, they are\r\nexempted from all ship’s duty except that of standing night-watches at\r\nsea, mustering at quarters, and coming on deck when all hands are\r\ncalled. They are rated as _able seamen_ or _ordinary seamen_, and\r\nreceive their wages as such; but in addition to this, they are\r\nliberally recompensed for their professional services. Herein their\r\nrate of pay is fixed for every sailor manipulated—so much per quarter,\r\nwhich is charged to the sailor, and credited to his barber on the books\r\nof the Purser.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that while a man-of-war barber is shaving his\r\ncustomers at so much per chin, his wages as a seaman are still running\r\non, which makes him a sort of _sleeping partner_ of a sailor; nor are\r\nthe sailor wages he receives altogether to be reckoned as earnings.\r\nConsidering the circumstances, however, not much objection can be made\r\nto the barbers on this score. But there were instances of men in the\r\nNeversink receiving government money in part pay for work done for\r\nprivate individuals. Among these were several accomplished tailors, who\r\nnearly the whole cruise sat cross-legged on the half deck, making\r\ncoats, pantaloons, and vests for the quarter-deck officers. Some of\r\nthese men, though knowing little or nothing about sailor duties, and\r\nseldom or never performing them, stood upon the ship’s books as\r\nordinary seamen, entitled to ten dollars a month. Why was this?\r\nPrevious to shipping they had divulged the fact of their being tailors.\r\nTrue, the officers who employed them upon their wardrobes paid them for\r\ntheir work, but some of them in such a way as to elicit much grumbling\r\nfrom the tailors. At any rate, these makers and menders of clothes did\r\nnot receive from some of these officers an amount equal to what they\r\ncould have fairly earned ashore by doing the same work. It was a\r\nconsiderable saving to the officers to have their clothes made on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThe men belonging to the carpenter’s gang furnished another case in\r\npoint. There were some six or eight allotted to this department. All\r\nthe cruise they were hard at work. At what? Mostly making chests of\r\ndrawers, canes, little ships and schooners, swifts, and other\r\nelaborated trifles, chiefly for the Captain. What did the Captain pay\r\nthem for their trouble? Nothing. But the United States government paid\r\nthem; two of them (the mates) at nineteen dollars a month, and the rest\r\nreceiving the pay of able seamen, twelve dollars.\r\n\r\nTo return.\r\n\r\nThe regular days upon which the barbers shall exercise their vocation\r\nare set down on the ship’s calendar, and known as _shaving days_. On\r\nboard of the Neversink these days are Wednesdays and Saturdays; when,\r\nimmediately after breakfast, the barbers’ shops were opened to\r\ncustomers. They were in different parts of the gun-deck, between the\r\nlong twenty-four pounders. Their furniture, however, was not very\r\nelaborate, hardly equal to the sumptuous appointments of metropolitan\r\nbarbers. Indeed, it merely consisted of a match-tub, elevated upon a\r\nshot-box, as a barber’s chair for the patient. No Psyche glasses; no\r\nhand-mirror; no ewer and basin; no comfortable padded footstool;\r\nnothing, in short, that makes a shore “_shave_” such a luxury.\r\n\r\nNor are the implements of these man-of-war barbers out of keeping with\r\nthe rude appearance of their shops. Their razors are of the simplest\r\npatterns, and, from their jagged-ness, would seem better fitted for the\r\npreparing and harrowing of the soil than for the ultimate reaping of\r\nthe crop. But this is no matter for wonder, since so many chins are to\r\nbe shaven, and a razor-case holds but two razors. For only two razors\r\ndoes a man-of-war barber have, and, like the marine sentries at the\r\ngangway in port, these razors go off and on duty in rotation. One\r\nbrush, too, brushes every chin, and one lather lathers them all. No\r\nprivate brushes and boxes; no reservations whatever.\r\n\r\nAs it would be altogether too much trouble for a man-of-war’s-man to\r\nkeep his own shaving-tools and shave himself at sea, and since,\r\ntherefore, nearly the whole ship’s company patronise the ship’s\r\nbarbers, and as the seamen must be shaven by evening quarters of the\r\ndays appointed for the business, it may be readily imagined what a\r\nscene of bustle and confusion there is when the razors are being\r\napplied. First come, first served, is the motto; and often you have to\r\nwait for hours together, sticking to your position (like one of an\r\nIndian file of merchants’ clerks getting letters out of the\r\npost-office), ere you have a chance to occupy the pedestal of the\r\nmatch-tub. Often the crowd of quarrelsome candidates wrangle and fight\r\nfor precedency, while at all times the interval is employed by the\r\ngarrulous in every variety of ship-gossip.\r\n\r\nAs the shaving days are unalterable, they often fall upon days of high\r\nseas and tempestuous winds, when the vessel pitches and rolls in a\r\nfrightful manner. In consequence, many valuable lives are jeopardised\r\nfrom the razor being plied under such untoward circumstances. But these\r\nsea-barbers pride themselves upon their sea-legs, and often you will\r\nsee them standing over their patients with their feet wide apart, and\r\nscientifically swaying their bodies to the motion of the ship, as they\r\nflourish their edge-tools about the lips, nostrils, and jugular.\r\n\r\nAs I looked upon the practitioner and patient at such times, I could\r\nnot help thinking that, if the sailor had any insurance on his life, it\r\nwould certainly be deemed forfeited should the president of the company\r\nchance to lounge by and behold him in that imminent peril. For myself,\r\nI accounted it an excellent preparation for going into a sea-fight,\r\nwhere fortitude in standing up to your gun and running the risk of all\r\nsplinters, comprise part of the practical qualities that make up an\r\nefficient man-of-war’s man.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be related, that these barbers of ours had their labours\r\nconsiderably abridged by a fashion prevailing among many of the crew,\r\nof wearing very large whiskers; so that, in most cases, the only parts\r\nneeding a shave were the upper lip and suburbs of the chin. This had\r\nbeen more or less the custom during the whole three years’ cruise; but\r\nfor some time previous to our weathering Cape Horn, very many of the\r\nseamen had redoubled their assiduity in cultivating their beards\r\npreparatory to their return to America. There they anticipated creating\r\nno small impression by their immense and magnificent\r\n_homeward-bounders_—so they called the long fly-brushes at their chins.\r\nIn particular, the more aged sailors, embracing the Old Guard of sea\r\ngrenadiers on the forecastle, and the begrimed gunner’s mates and\r\nquarter-gunners, sported most venerable beards of an exceeding length\r\nand hoariness, like long, trailing moss hanging from the bough of some\r\naged oak. Above all, the Captain of the Forecastle, old Ushant—a fine\r\nspecimen of a sea sexagenarian—wore a wide, spreading beard, gizzled\r\nand grey, that flowed over his breast and often became tangled and\r\nknotted with tar. This Ushant, in all weathers, was ever alert at his\r\nduty; intrepidly mounting the fore-yard in a gale, his long beard\r\nstreaming like Neptune’s. Off Cape Horn it looked like a miller’s,\r\nbeing all over powdered with frost; sometimes it glittered with minute\r\nicicles in the pale, cold, moonlit Patagonian nights. But though he was\r\nso active in time of tempest, yet when his duty did not call for\r\nexertion, he was a remarkably staid, reserved, silent, and majestic old\r\nman, holding himself aloof from noisy revelry, and never participating\r\nin the boisterous sports of the crew. He resolutely set his beard\r\nagainst their boyish frolickings, and often held forth like an oracle\r\nconcerning the vanity thereof. Indeed, at times he was wont to talk\r\nphilosophy to his ancient companions—the old sheet-anchor-men around\r\nhim—as well as to the hare-brained tenants of the fore-top, and the\r\ngiddy lads in the mizzen.\r\n\r\nNor was his philosophy to be despised; it abounded in wisdom. For this\r\nUshant was an old man, of strong natural sense, who had seen nearly the\r\nwhole terraqueous globe, and could reason of civilized and savage, of\r\nGentile and Jew, of Christian and Moslem. The long night-watches of the\r\nsailor are eminently adapted to draw out the reflective faculties of\r\nany serious-minded man, however humble or uneducated. Judge, then, what\r\nhalf a century of battling out watches on the ocean must have done for\r\nthis fine old tar. He was a sort of a sea-Socrates, in his old age\r\n“pouring out his last philosophy and life,” as sweet Spenser has it;\r\nand I never could look at him, and survey his right reverend beard,\r\nwithout bestowing upon him that title which, in one of his satires,\r\nPersius gives to the immortal quaffer of the hemlock—_Magister\r\nBarbatus_—the bearded master.\r\n\r\nNot a few of the ship’s company had also bestowed great pains upon\r\ntheir hair, which some of them—especially the genteel young sailor\r\nbucks of the After-guard—wore over their shoulders like the ringleted\r\nCavaliers. Many sailors, with naturally tendril locks, prided\r\nthemselves upon what they call _love curls_, worn at the side of the\r\nhead, just before the ear—a custom peculiar to tars, and which seems to\r\nhave filled the vacated place of the old-fashioned Lord Rodney cue,\r\nwhich they used to wear some fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nBut there were others of the crew labouring under the misfortune of\r\nlong, lank, Winnebago locks, carroty bunches of hair, or rebellious\r\nbristles of a sandy hue. Ambitious of redundant mops, these still\r\nsuffered their carrots to grow, spite of all ridicule. They looked like\r\nHuns and Scandinavians; and one of them, a young Down Easter, the\r\nunenvied proprietor of a thick crop of inflexible yellow bamboos, went\r\nby the name of _Peter the Wild Boy_; for, like Peter the Wild Boy in\r\nFrance, it was supposed that he must have been caught like a catamount\r\nin the pine woods of Maine. But there were many fine, flowing heads of\r\nhair to counter-balance such sorry exhibitions as Peter’s.\r\n\r\nWhat with long whiskers and venerable beards, then, of every variety of\r\ncut—Charles the Fifth’s and Aurelian’s—and endless _goatees_ and\r\n_imperials;_ and what with abounding locks, our crew seemed a company\r\nof Merovingians or Long-haired kings, mixed with savage Lombards or\r\nLongobardi, so called from their lengthy beards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXV.\r\nTHE GREAT MASSACRE OF THE BEARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapter fitly paves the way for the present, wherein it\r\nsadly befalls White-Jacket to chronicle a calamitous event, which\r\nfilled the Neversink with long lamentations, that echo through all her\r\ndecks and tops. After dwelling upon our redundant locks and\r\nthrice-noble beards, fain would I cease, and let the sequel remain\r\nundisclosed, but truth and fidelity forbid.\r\n\r\nAs I now deviously hover and lingeringly skirmish about the frontiers\r\nof this melancholy recital, a feeling of sadness comes over me that I\r\ncannot withstand. Such a heartless massacre of hair! Such a\r\nBartholomew’s Day and Sicilian Vespers of assassinated beards! Ah! who\r\nwould believe it! With intuitive sympathy I feel of my own brown beard\r\nwhile I write, and thank my kind stars that each precious hair is for\r\never beyond the reach of the ruthless barbers of a man-of-war!\r\n\r\nIt needs that this sad and most serious matter should be faithfully\r\ndetailed. Throughout the cruise, many of the officers had expressed\r\ntheir abhorrence of the impunity with which the most extensive\r\nplantations of hair were cultivated under their very noses; and they\r\nfrowned upon every beard with even greater dislike. They said it was\r\nunseamanlike; not _ship-shape;_ in short, it was disgraceful to the\r\nNavy. But as Captain Claret said nothing, and as the officers, of\r\nthemselves, had no authority to preach a crusade against whiskerandoes,\r\nthe Old Guard on the forecastle still complacently stroked their\r\nbeards, and the sweet youths of the After-guard still lovingly threaded\r\ntheir fingers through their curls.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Captain’s generosity in thus far permitting our beards\r\nsprung from the fact that he himself wore a small speck of a beard upon\r\nhis own imperial cheek; which if rumour said true, was to hide\r\nsomething, as Plutarch relates of the Emperor Adrian. But, to do him\r\njustice—as I always have done—the Captain’s beard did not exceed the\r\nlimits prescribed by the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nAccording to a then recent ordinance at Washington, the beards of both\r\nofficers and seamen were to be accurately laid out and surveyed, and on\r\nno account must come lower than the mouth, so as to correspond with the\r\nArmy standard—a regulation directly opposed to the theocratical law\r\nlaid down in the nineteenth chapter and twenty-seventh verse of\r\nLeviticus, where it is expressly ordained, “_Thou shalt not mar the\r\ncorners of thy beard_.” But legislators do not always square their\r\nstatutes by those of the Bible.\r\n\r\nAt last, when we had crossed the Northern Tropic, and were standing up\r\nto our guns at evening quarters, and when the setting sun, streaming in\r\nat the port-holes, lit up every hair, till to an observer on the\r\nquarter-deck, the two long, even lines of beards seemed one dense\r\ngrove; in that evil hour it must have been, that a cruel thought\r\nentered into the heart of our Captain.\r\n\r\nA pretty set of savages, thought he, am I taking home to America;\r\npeople will think them all catamounts and Turks. Besides, now that I\r\nthink of it, it’s against the law. It will never do. They must be\r\nshaven and shorn—that’s flat.\r\n\r\nThere is no knowing, indeed, whether these were the very words in which\r\nthe Captain meditated that night; for it is yet a mooted point among\r\nmetaphysicians, whether we think in words or whether we think in\r\nthoughts. But something like the above must have been the Captain’s\r\ncogitations. At any rate, that very evening the ship’s company were\r\nastounded by an extraordinary announcement made at the main-hatch-way\r\nof the gun-deck, by the Boat-swain’s mate there stationed. He was\r\nafterwards discovered to have been tipsy at the time.\r\n\r\n“D’ye hear there, fore and aft? All you that have hair on your heads,\r\nshave them off; and all you that have beards, trim ’em small!”\r\n\r\nShave off our Christian heads! And then, placing them between our\r\nknees, trim small our worshipped beards! The Captain was mad.\r\n\r\nBut directly the Boatswain came rushing to the hatchway, and, after\r\nsoundly rating his tipsy mate, thundered forth a true version of the\r\norder that had issued from the quarter-deck. As amended, it ran thus:\r\n\r\n“D’ye hear there, fore and aft? All you that have long hair, cut it\r\nshort; and all you that have large whiskers, trim them down, according\r\nto the Navy regulations.”\r\n\r\nThis was an amendment, to be sure; but what barbarity, after all! What!\r\nnot thirty days’ run from home, and lose our magnificent\r\nhomeward-bounders! The homeward-bounders we had been cultivating so\r\nlong! Lose them at one fell swoop? Were the vile barbers of the\r\ngun-deck to reap our long, nodding harvests, and expose our innocent\r\nchins to the chill air of the Yankee coast! And our viny locks! were\r\nthey also to be shorn? Was a grand sheep-shearing, such as they\r\nannually have at Nantucket, to take place; and our ignoble barbers to\r\ncarry off the fleece?\r\n\r\nCaptain Claret! in cutting our beards and our hair, you cut us the\r\nunkindest cut of all! Were we going into action, Captain Claret—going\r\nto fight the foe with our hearts of flame and our arms of steel, then\r\nwould we gladly offer up our beards to the terrific God of War, and\r\n_that_ we would account but a wise precaution against having them\r\ntweaked by the foe. _Then_, Captain Claret, you would but be imitating\r\nthe example of Alexander, who had his Macedonians all shaven, that in\r\nthe hour of battle their beards might not be handles to the Persians.\r\nBut _now_, Captain Claret! when after our long, long cruise, we are\r\nreturning to our homes, tenderly stroking the fine tassels on our\r\nchins; and thinking of father or mother, or sister or brother, or\r\ndaughter or son; to cut off our beards now—the very beards that were\r\nfrosted white off the pitch of Patagonia—_this_ is too bitterly bad,\r\nCaptain Claret! and, by Heaven, we will not submit. Train your guns\r\ninboard, let the marines fix their bayonets, let the officers draw\r\ntheir swords; we _will not_ let our beards be reaped—the last insult\r\ninflicted upon a vanquished foe in the East!\r\n\r\nWhere are you, sheet-anchor-men! Captains of the tops! gunner’s mates!\r\nmariners, all! Muster round the capstan your venerable beards, and\r\nwhile you braid them together in token of brotherhood, cross hands and\r\nswear that we will enact over again the mutiny of the Nore, and sooner\r\nperish than yield up a hair!\r\n\r\nThe excitement was intense throughout that whole evening. Groups of\r\ntens and twenties were scattered about all the decks, discussing the\r\nmandate, and inveighing against its barbarous author. The long area of\r\nthe gun-deck was something like a populous street of brokers, when some\r\nterrible commercial tidings have newly arrived. One and all, they\r\nresolved not to succumb, and every man swore to stand by his beard and\r\nhis neighbour.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four hours after—at the next evening quarters—the Captain’s eye\r\nwas observed to wander along the men at their guns—not a beard was\r\nshaven!\r\n\r\nWhen the drum beat the retreat, the Boatswain—now attended by all four\r\nof his mates, to give additional solemnity to the announcement—repeated\r\nthe previous day’s order, and concluded by saying, that twenty-four\r\nhours would be given for all to acquiesce.\r\n\r\nBut the second day passed, and at quarters, untouched, every beard\r\nbristled on its chin. Forthwith Captain Claret summoned the midshipmen,\r\nwho, receiving his orders, hurried to the various divisions of the\r\nguns, and communicated them to the Lieutenants respectively stationed\r\nover divisions.\r\n\r\nThe officer commanding mine turned upon us, and said, “Men, if tomorrow\r\nnight I find any of you with long hair, or whiskers of a standard\r\nviolating the Navy regulations, the names of such offenders shall be\r\nput down on the report.”\r\n\r\nThe affair had now assumed a most serious aspect. The Captain was in\r\nearnest. The excitement increased ten-fold; and a great many of the\r\nolder seamen, exasperated to the uttermost, talked about _knocking of\r\nduty_ till the obnoxious mandate was revoked. I thought it impossible\r\nthat they would seriously think of such a folly; but there is no\r\nknowing what man-of-war’s-men will sometimes do, under\r\nprovocation—witness Parker and the Nore.\r\n\r\nThat same night, when the first watch was set, the men in a body drove\r\nthe two boatswain’s mates from their stations at the fore and main\r\nhatchways, and unshipped the ladders; thus cutting off all\r\ncommunication between the gun and spar decks, forward of the main-mast.\r\n\r\nMad Jack had the trumpet; and no sooner was this incipient mutiny\r\nreported to him, than he jumped right down among the mob, and\r\nfearlessly mingling with them, exclaimed, “What do you mean, men? don’t\r\nbe fools! This is no way to get what you want. Turn to, my lads, turn\r\nto! Boatswain’s mate, ship that ladder! So! up you tumble, now, my\r\nhearties! away you go!”\r\n\r\nHis gallant, off-handed, confident manner, recognising no attempt at\r\nmutiny, operated upon the sailors like magic.\r\n\r\nThey _tumbled up_, as commanded; and for the rest of that night\r\ncontented themselves with privately fulminating their displeasure\r\nagainst the Captain, and publicly emblazoning every anchor-button on\r\nthe coat of admired Mad jack.\r\n\r\nCaptain Claret happened to be taking a nap in his cabin at the moment\r\nof the disturbance; and it was quelled so soon that he knew nothing of\r\nit till it was officially reported to him. It was afterward rumoured\r\nthrough the ship that he reprimanded Mad Jack for acting as he did. He\r\nmaintained that he should at once have summoned the marines, and\r\ncharged upon the “mutineers.” But if the sayings imputed to the Captain\r\nwere true, he nevertheless refrained from subsequently noticing the\r\ndisturbance, or attempting to seek out and punish the ringleaders. This\r\nwas but wise; for there are times when even the most potent governor\r\nmust wink at transgression in order to preserve the laws inviolate for\r\nthe future. And great care is to be taken, by timely management, to\r\navert an incontestable act of mutiny, and so prevent men from being\r\nroused, by their own consciousness of transgression, into all the fury\r\nof an unbounded insurrection. _Then_ for the time, both soldiers and\r\nsailors are irresistible; as even the valour of Caesar was made to\r\nknow, and the prudence of Germanicus, when their legions rebelled. And\r\nnot all the concessions of Earl Spencer, as First lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, nor the threats and entreaties of Lord Bridport, the Admiral\r\nof the Fleet—no, nor his gracious Majesty’s plenary pardon in\r\nprospective, could prevail upon the Spithead mutineers (when at last\r\nfairly lashed up to the mark) to succumb, until deserted by their own\r\nmess-mates, and a handful was left in the breach.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Mad Jack! you did right, and no one else could have\r\nacquitted himself better. By your crafty simplicity, good-natured\r\ndaring, and off-handed air (as if nothing was happening) you perhaps\r\nquelled a very serious affair in the bud, and prevented the disgrace to\r\nthe American Navy of a tragical mutiny, growing out of whiskers,\r\nsoap-suds, and razors. Think of it, if future historians should devote\r\na long chapter to the great _Rebellion of the Beards_ on board the\r\nUnited States ship Neversink. Why, through all time thereafter, barbers\r\nwould cut down their spiralised poles, and substitute miniature\r\nmain-masts for the emblems of their calling.\r\n\r\nAnd here is ample scope for some pregnant instruction, how that events\r\nof vast magnitude in our man-of-war world may originate in the pettiest\r\nof trifles. But that is an old theme; we waive it, and proceed.\r\n\r\nOn the morning following, though it was not a regular shaving day, the\r\ngun-deck barbers were observed to have their shops open, their\r\nmatch-tub accommodations in readiness, and their razors displayed. With\r\ntheir brushes, raising a mighty lather in their tin pots, they stood\r\neyeing the passing throng of seamen, silently inviting them to walk in\r\nand be served. In addition to their usual implements, they now\r\nflourished at intervals a huge pair of sheep-shears, by way of more\r\nforcibly reminding the men of the edict which that day must be obeyed,\r\nor woe betide them.\r\n\r\nFor some hours the seamen paced to and fro in no very good humour,\r\nvowing not to sacrifice a hair. Beforehand, they denounced that man who\r\nshould abase himself by compliance. But habituation to discipline is\r\nmagical; and ere long an old forecastle-man was discovered elevated\r\nupon a match-tub, while, with a malicious grin, his barber—a fellow\r\nwho, from his merciless rasping, was called Blue-Skin—seized him by his\r\nlong beard, and at one fell stroke cut it off and tossed it out of the\r\nport-hole behind him. This forecastle-man was ever afterwards known by\r\na significant title—in the main equivalent to that name of reproach\r\nfastened upon that Athenian who, in Alexander’s time, previous to which\r\nall the Greeks sported beards, first submitted to the deprivation of\r\nhis own. But, spite of all the contempt hurled on our forecastle-man,\r\nso prudent an example was soon followed; presently all the barbers were\r\nbusy.\r\n\r\nSad sight! at which any one but a barber or a Tartar would have wept!\r\nBeards three years old; _goatees_ that would have graced a Chamois of\r\nthe Alps; _imperials_ that Count D’Orsay would have envied; and\r\n_love-curls_ and man-of-war ringlets that would have measured, inch for\r\ninch, with the longest tresses of The Fair One with the Golden\r\nLocks—all went by the board! Captain Claret! how can you rest in your\r\nhammock! by this brown beard which now waves from my chin—the\r\nillustrious successor to that first, young, vigorous beard I yielded to\r\nyour tyranny—by this manly beard, I swear, it was barbarous!\r\n\r\nMy noble captain, Jack Chase, was indignant. Not even all the special\r\nfavours he had received from Captain Claret, and the plenary pardon\r\nextended to him for his desertion into the Peruvian service, could\r\nrestrain the expression of his feelings. But in his cooler moments,\r\nJack was a wise man; he at last deemed it but wisdom to succumb.\r\n\r\nWhen he went to the barber he almost drew tears from his eyes. Seating\r\nhimself mournfully on the match-tub, he looked sideways, and said to\r\nthe barber, who was _slithering_ his sheep-shears in readiness to\r\nbegin: “My friend, I trust your scissors are consecrated. Let them not\r\ntouch this beard if they have yet to be dipped in holy water; beards\r\nare sacred things, barber. Have you no feeling for beards, my friend?\r\nthink of it;” and mournfully he laid his deep-dyed, russet cheek upon\r\nhis hand. “Two summers have gone by since my chin has been reaped. I\r\nwas in Coquimbo then, on the Spanish Main; and when the husband-man was\r\nsowing his Autumnal grain on the Vega, I started this blessed beard;\r\nand when the vine-dressers were trimming their vines in the vineyards,\r\nI first trimmed it to the sound of a flute. Ah! barber, have you no\r\nheart? This beard has been caressed by the snow-white hand of the\r\nlovely Tomasita of Tombez—the Castilian belle of all lower Peru. Think\r\nof _that_, barber! I have worn it as an officer on the quarter-deck of\r\na Peruvian man-of-war. I have sported it at brilliant fandangoes in\r\nLima. I have been alow and aloft with it at sea. Yea, barber! it has\r\nstreamed like an Admiral’s pennant at the mast-head of this same\r\ngallant frigate, the Neversink! Oh! barber, barber! it stabs me to the\r\nheart.—Talk not of hauling down your ensigns and standards when\r\nvanquished—what is _that_, barber! to striking the flag that Nature\r\nherself has nailed to the mast!”\r\n\r\nHere noble Jack’s feelings overcame him: he dropped from the animated\r\nattitude into which his enthusiasm had momentarily transported him; his\r\nproud head sunk upon his chest, and his long, sad beard almost grazed\r\nthe deck.\r\n\r\n“Ay! trail your beards in grief and dishonour, oh crew of the\r\nNeversink!” sighed Jack. “Barber, come closer—now, tell me, my friend,\r\nhave you obtained absolution for this deed you are about to commit? You\r\nhave not? Then, barber, I will absolve you; your hands shall be washed\r\nof this sin; it is not you, but another; and though you are about to\r\nshear off my manhood, yet, barber, I freely forgive you; kneel, kneel,\r\nbarber! that I may bless you, in token that I cherish no malice!”\r\n\r\nSo when this barber, who was the only tender-hearted one of his tribe,\r\nhad kneeled, been absolved, and then blessed, Jack gave up his beard\r\ninto his hands, and the barber, clipping it off with a sigh, held it\r\nhigh aloft, and, parodying the style of the boatswain’s mates, cried\r\naloud, “D’ye hear, fore and aft? This is the beard of our matchless\r\nJack Chase, the noble captain of this frigate’s main-top!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVI.\r\nTHE REBELS BROUGHT TO THE MAST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough many heads of hair were shorn, and many fine beards reaped that\r\nday, yet several still held out, and vowed to defend their sacred hair\r\nto the last gasp of their breath. These were chiefly old sailors—some\r\nof them petty officers—who, presuming upon their age or rank, doubtless\r\nthought that, after so many had complied with the Captain’s commands,\r\n_they_, being but a handful, would be exempted from compliance, and\r\nremain a monument of our master’s clemency.\r\n\r\nThat same evening, when the drum beat to quarters, the sailors went\r\nsullenly to their guns, and the old tars who still sported their beards\r\nstood up, grim, defying, and motionless, as the rows of sculptured\r\nAssyrian kings, who, with their magnificent beards, have recently been\r\nexhumed by Layard.\r\n\r\nWhen the proper time arrived, their names were taken down by the\r\nofficers of divisions, and they were afterward summoned in a body to\r\nthe mast, where the Captain stood ready to receive them. The whole\r\nship’s company crowded to the spot, and, amid the breathless multitude,\r\nthe venerable rebels advanced and unhatted.\r\n\r\nIt was an imposing display. They were old and venerable mariners; their\r\ncheeks had been burned brown in all latitudes, wherever the sun sends a\r\ntropical ray. Reverend old tars, one and all; some of them might have\r\nbeen grandsires, with grandchildren in every port round the world. They\r\nought to have commanded the veneration of the most frivolous or\r\nmagisterial beholder. Even Captain Claret they ought to have humiliated\r\ninto deference. But a Scythian is touched with no reverential\r\npromptings; and, as the Roman student well knows, the august Senators\r\nthemselves, seated in the Senate-house, on the majestic hill of the\r\nCapitol, had their holy beards tweaked by the insolent chief of the\r\nGoths.\r\n\r\nSuch an array of beards! spade-shaped, hammer-shaped, dagger-shaped,\r\ntriangular, square, peaked, round, hemispherical, and forked. But chief\r\namong them all, was old Ushant’s, the ancient Captain of the\r\nForecastle. Of a Gothic venerableness, it fell upon his breast like a\r\ncontinual iron-gray storm.\r\n\r\nAh! old Ushant, Nestor of the crew! it promoted my longevity to behold\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nHe was a man-of-war’s-man of the old Benbow school. He wore a short\r\ncue, which the wags of the mizzen-top called his “_plug of pig-tail_.”\r\nAbout his waist was a broad boarder’s belt, which he wore, he said, to\r\nbrace his main-mast, meaning his backbone; for at times he complained\r\nof rheumatic twinges in the spine, consequent upon sleeping on deck,\r\nnow and then, during the night-watches of upward of half a century. His\r\nsheath-knife was an antique—a sort of old-fashioned pruning-hook; its\r\nhandle—a sperm whale’s tooth—was carved all over with ships, cannon,\r\nand anchors. It was attached to his neck by a _lanyard_, elaborately\r\nworked into “rose-knots” and “Turks’ heads” by his own venerable\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nOf all the crew, this Ushant was most beloved by my glorious captain,\r\nJack Chase, who one day pointed him out to me as the old man was slowly\r\ncoming down the rigging from the fore-top.\r\n\r\n“There, White-Jacket! isn’t that old Chaucer’s shipman?\r\n\r\n     “‘A dagger hanging by a las hadde he,\r\n           About his nekke, under his arm adown;\r\n           The hote sommer hadde made his beard all brown.\r\n       Hardy he is, and wise; I undertake\r\n       With many a tempest has his beard be shake.’\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Canterbury Tales, White-Jacket! and must not old Ushant have\r\nbeen living in Chaucer’s time, that Chaucer could draw his portrait so\r\nwell?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVII.\r\nOLD USHANT AT THE GANGWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rebel beards, headed by old Ushant’s, streaming like a Commodore’s\r\n_bougee_, now stood in silence at the mast.\r\n\r\n“You knew the order!” said the Captain, eyeing them severely; “what\r\ndoes that hair on your chins?”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the Captain of the Forecastle, “did old Ushant ever refuse\r\ndoing his duty? did he ever yet miss his muster? But, sir, old Ushant’s\r\nbeard is his own!”\r\n\r\n“What’s that, sir? Master-at-arms, put that man into the brig.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” said the old man, respectfully, “the three years for which I\r\nshipped are expired; and though I am perhaps bound to work the ship\r\nhome, yet, as matters are, I think my beard might be allowed me. It is\r\nbut a few days, Captain Claret.”\r\n\r\n“Put him into the brig!” cried the Captain; “and now, you old rascals!”\r\nhe added, turning round upon the rest, “I give you fifteen minutes to\r\nhave those beards taken off; if they then remain on your chins, I’ll\r\nflog you—every mother’s son of you—though you were all my own\r\ngod-fathers!”\r\n\r\nThe band of beards went forward, summoned their barbers, and their\r\nglorious pennants were no more. In obedience to orders, they then\r\nparaded themselves at the mast, and, addressing the Captain, said,\r\n“Sir, our _muzzle-lashings_ are cast off!”\r\n\r\nNor is it unworthy of being chronicled, that not a single sailor who\r\ncomplied with the general order but refused to sport the vile\r\n_regulation-whiskers_ prescribed by the Navy Department. No! like\r\nheroes they cried, “Shave me clean! I will not wear a hair, since I\r\ncannot wear all!”\r\n\r\nOn the morrow, after breakfast, Ushant was taken out of irons, and,\r\nwith the master-at-arms on one side and an armed sentry on the other,\r\nwas escorted along the gun-deck and up the ladder to the main-mast.\r\nThere the Captain stood, firm as before. They must have guarded the old\r\nman thus to prevent his escape to the shore, something less than a\r\nthousand miles distant at the time.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir, will you have that beard taken off? you have slept over it\r\na whole night now; what do you say? I don’t want to flog an old man\r\nlike you, Ushant!”\r\n\r\n“My beard is my own, sir!” said the old man, lowly.\r\n\r\n“Will you take it off?”\r\n\r\n“It is mine, sir?” said the old man, tremulously.\r\n\r\n“Rig the gratings?” roared the Captain. “Master-at-arms, strip him!\r\nquarter-masters, seize him up! boatswain’s mates, do your duty!”\r\n\r\nWhile these executioners were employed, the Captain’s excitement had a\r\nlittle time to abate; and when, at last, old Ushant was tied up by the\r\narms and legs and his venerable back was exposed—that back which had\r\nbowed at the guns of the frigate Constitution when she captured the\r\nGuerriere—the Captain seemed to relent.\r\n\r\n“You are a very old man,” he said, “and I am sorry to flog you; but my\r\norders must be obeyed. I will give you one more chance; will you have\r\nthat beard taken off?”\r\n\r\n“Captain Claret,” said the old man, turning round painfully in his\r\nbonds, “you may flog me if you will; but, sir, in this one thing I\r\n_cannot_ obey you.”\r\n\r\n“Lay on! I’ll see his backbone!” roared the Captain in a sudden fury.\r\n\r\n“By Heaven!” thrillingly whispered Jack Chase, who stood by, “it’s only\r\na halter; I’ll strike him!”\r\n\r\n“Better not,” said a top-mate; “it’s death, or worse punishment,\r\nremember.”\r\n\r\n“There goes the lash!” cried Jack. “Look at the old man! By G—-d, I\r\ncan’t stand it! Let me go, men!” and with moist eyes Jack forced his\r\nway to one side.\r\n\r\n“You, boatswain’s mate,” cried the Captain, “you are favouring that\r\nman! Lay on soundly, sir, or I’ll have your own _cat_ laid soundly on\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nOne, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,\r\ntwelve lashes were laid on the back of that heroic old man. He only\r\nbowed over his head, and stood as the Dying Gladiator lies.\r\n\r\n“Cut him down,” said the Captain.\r\n\r\n“And now go and cut your own throat,” hoarsely whispered an old\r\nsheet-anchor-man, a mess-mate of Ushant’s.\r\n\r\nWhen the master-at-arms advanced with the prisoner’s shirt, Ushant\r\nwaved him off with the dignified air of a Brahim, saying, “Do you\r\nthink, master-at-arms, that I am hurt? I will put on my own garment. I\r\nam never the worse for it, man; and ’tis no dishonour when he who would\r\ndishonour you, only dishonours himself.”\r\n\r\n“What says he?” cried the Captain; “what says that tarry old\r\nphilosopher with the smoking back? Tell it to me, sir, if you dare!\r\nSentry, take that man back to the brig. Stop! John Ushant, you have\r\nbeen Captain of the Forecastle; I break you. And now you go into the\r\nbrig, there to remain till you consent to have that beard taken off.”\r\n\r\n“My beard is my own,” said the old man, quietly. “Sentry, I am ready.”\r\n\r\nAnd back he went into durance between the guns; but after lying some\r\nfour or five days in irons, an order came to remove them; but he was\r\nstill kept confined.\r\n\r\nBooks were allowed him, and he spent much time in reading. But he also\r\nspent many hours in braiding his beard, and interweaving with it strips\r\nof red bunting, as if he desired to dress out and adorn the thing which\r\nhad triumphed over all opposition.\r\n\r\nHe remained a prisoner till we arrived in America; but the very moment\r\nhe heard the chain rattle out of the hawse-hole, and the ship swing to\r\nher anchor, he started to his feet, dashed the sentry aside, and\r\ngaining the deck, exclaimed, “At home, with my beard!”\r\n\r\nHis term of service having some months previous expired, and the ship\r\nbeing now in harbour, he was beyond the reach of naval law, and the\r\nofficers durst not molest him. But without unduly availing himself of\r\nthese circumstances, the old man merely got his bag and hammock\r\ntogether, hired a boat, and throwing himself into the stern, was rowed\r\nashore, amid the unsuppressible cheers of all hands. It was a glorious\r\nconquest over the Conqueror himself, as well worthy to be celebrated as\r\nthe Battle of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThough, as I afterward learned, Ushant was earnestly entreated to put\r\nthe case into some lawyer’s hands, he firmly declined, saying, “I have\r\nwon the battle, my friends, and I do not care for the prize-money.” But\r\neven had he complied with these entreaties, from precedents in similar\r\ncases, it is almost certain that not a sou’s worth of satisfaction\r\nwould have been received.\r\n\r\nI know not in what frigate you sail now, old Ushant; but Heaven protect\r\nyour storied old beard, in whatever Typhoon it may blow. And if ever it\r\nmust be shorn, old man, may it fare like the royal beard of Henry I.,\r\nof England, and be clipped by the right reverend hand of some\r\nArchbishop of Sees.\r\n\r\nAs for Captain Claret, let it not be supposed that it is here sought to\r\nimpale him before the world as a cruel, black-hearted man. Such he was\r\nnot. Nor was he, upon the whole, regarded by his crew with anything\r\nlike the feelings which man-of-war’s-men sometimes cherish toward\r\nsignally tyrannical commanders. In truth, the majority of the\r\nNeversink’s crew—in previous cruises habituated to flagrant\r\nmisusage—deemed Captain Claret a lenient officer. In many things he\r\ncertainly refrained from oppressing them. It has been related what\r\nprivileges he accorded to the seamen respecting the free playing of\r\ncheckers—a thing almost unheard of in most American men-of-war. In the\r\nmatter of overseeing the men’s clothing, also, he was remarkably\r\nindulgent, compared with the conduct of other Navy captains, who, by\r\nsumptuary regulations, oblige their sailors to run up large bills with\r\nthe Purser for clothes. In a word, of whatever acts Captain Claret\r\nmight have been guilty in the Neversink, perhaps none of them proceeded\r\nfrom any personal, organic hard-heartedness. What he was, the usages of\r\nthe Navy had made him. Had he been a mere landsman—a merchant, say—he\r\nwould no doubt have been considered a kind-hearted man.\r\n\r\nThere may be some who shall read of this Bartholomew Massacre of beards\r\nwho will yet marvel, perhaps, that the loss of a few hairs, more or\r\nless, should provoke such hostility from the sailors, lash them into so\r\nfrothing a rage; indeed, come near breeding a mutiny.\r\n\r\nBut these circumstances are not without precedent. Not to speak of the\r\nriots, attended with the loss of life, which once occurred in Madrid,\r\nin resistance to an arbitrary edict of the king’s, seeking to suppress\r\nthe cloaks of the Cavaliers; and, not to make mention of other\r\ninstances that might be quoted, it needs only to point out the rage of\r\nthe Saxons in the time of William the Conqueror, when that despot\r\ncommanded the hair on their upper lips to be shaven off—the hereditary\r\nmustaches which whole generations had sported. The multitude of the\r\ndispirited vanquished were obliged to acquiesce; but many Saxon\r\nFranklins and gentlemen of spirit, choosing rather to lose their\r\ncastles than their mustaches, voluntarily deserted their firesides, and\r\nwent into exile. All this is indignantly related by the stout Saxon\r\nfriar, Matthew Paris, in his _Historia Major_, beginning with the\r\nNorman Conquest.\r\n\r\nAnd that our man-of-war’s-men were right in desiring to perpetuate\r\ntheir beards, as martial appurtenances, must seem very plain, when it\r\nis considered that, as the beard is the token of manhood, so, in some\r\nshape or other, has it ever been held the true badge of a warrior.\r\nBonaparte’s grenadiers were stout whiskerandoes; and perhaps, in a\r\ncharge, those fierce whiskers of theirs did as much to appall the foe\r\nas the sheen of their bayonets. Most all fighting creatures sport\r\neither whiskers or beards; it seems a law of Dame Nature. Witness the\r\nboar, the tiger, the cougar, man, the leopard, the ram, the cat—all\r\nwarriors, and all whiskerandoes. Whereas, the peace-loving tribes have\r\nmostly enameled chins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII.\r\nFLOGGING THROUGH THE FLEET.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flogging of an old man like Ushant, most landsmen will probably\r\nregard with abhorrence. But though, from peculiar circumstances, his\r\ncase occasioned a good deal of indignation among the people of the\r\nNeversink, yet, upon its own proper grounds, they did not denounce it.\r\nMan-of-war’s-men are so habituated to what landsmen would deem\r\nexcessive cruelties, that they are almost reconciled to inferior\r\nseverities.\r\n\r\nAnd here, though the subject of punishment in the Navy has been\r\ncanvassed in previous chapters, and though the thing is every way a\r\nmost unpleasant and grievous one to enlarge upon, and though I\r\npainfully nerve myself to it while I write, a feeling of duty compels\r\nme to enter upon a branch of the subject till now undiscussed. I would\r\nnot be like the man, who, seeing an outcast perishing by the roadside,\r\nturned about to his friend, saying, “Let us cross the way; my soul so\r\nsickens at this sight, that I cannot endure it.”\r\n\r\nThere are certain enormities in this man-of-war world that often secure\r\nimpunity by their very excessiveness. Some ignorant people will refrain\r\nfrom permanently removing the cause of a deadly malaria, for fear of\r\nthe temporary spread of its offensiveness. Let us not be of such. The\r\nmore repugnant and repelling, the greater the evil. Leaving our women\r\nand children behind, let us freely enter this Golgotha.\r\n\r\nYears ago there was a punishment inflicted in the English, and I\r\nbelieve in the American Navy, called _keel-hauling_—a phrase still\r\nemployed by man-of-war’s-men when they would express some signal\r\nvengeance upon a personal foe. The practice still remains in the French\r\nnational marine, though it is by no means resorted to so frequently as\r\nin times past. It consists of attaching tackles to the two extremities\r\nof the main-yard, and passing the rope under the ship’s bottom. To one\r\nend of this rope the culprit is secured; his own shipmates are then\r\nmade to run him up and down, first on this side, then on that—now\r\nscraping the ship’s hull under water—anon, hoisted, stunned and\r\nbreathless, into the air.\r\n\r\nBut though this barbarity is now abolished from the English and\r\nAmerican navies, there still remains another practice which, if\r\nanything, is even worse than _keel-hauling_. This remnant of the Middle\r\nAges is known in the Navy as “_flogging through the fleet_.” It is\r\nnever inflicted except by authority of a court-martial upon some\r\ntrespasser deemed guilty of a flagrant offence. Never, that I know of,\r\nhas it been inflicted by an American man-of-war on the home station.\r\nThe reason, probably, is, that the officers well know that such a\r\nspectacle would raise a mob in any American seaport.\r\n\r\nBy XLI. of the Articles of War, a court-martial shall not “for any one\r\noffence not capital,” inflict a punishment beyond one hundred lashes.\r\nIn cases “not capital” this law may be, and has been, quoted in\r\njudicial justification of the infliction of more than one hundred\r\nlashes. Indeed, it would cover a thousand. Thus: One act of a sailor\r\nmay be construed into the commission of ten different transgressions,\r\nfor each of which he may be legally condemned to a hundred lashes, to\r\nbe inflicted without intermission. It will be perceived, that in any\r\ncase deemed “capital,” a sailor under the above Article, may legally be\r\nflogged to the death.\r\n\r\nBut neither by the Articles of War, nor by any other enactment of\r\nCongress, is there any direct warrant for the extraordinary cruelty of\r\nthe mode in which punishment is inflicted, in cases of flogging through\r\nthe fleet. But as in numerous other instances, the incidental\r\naggravations of this penalty are indirectly covered by other clauses in\r\nthe Articles of War: one of which authorises the authorities of a\r\nship—in certain indefinite cases—to correct the guilty “_according to\r\nthe usages of the sea-service_.”\r\n\r\nOne of these “usages” is the following:\r\n\r\nAll hands being called “to witness punishment” in the ship to which the\r\nculprit belongs, the sentence of the court-martial condemning him is\r\nread, when, with the usual solemnities, a portion of the punishment is\r\ninflicted. In order that it shall not lose in severity by the slightest\r\nexhaustion in the arm of the executioner, a fresh boatswain’s mate is\r\ncalled out at every dozen.\r\n\r\nAs the leading idea is to strike terror into the beholders, the\r\ngreatest number of lashes is inflicted on board the culprit’s own ship,\r\nin order to render him the more shocking spectacle to the crews of the\r\nother vessels.\r\n\r\nThe first infliction being concluded, the culprit’s shirt is thrown\r\nover him; he is put into a boat—the Rogue’s March being played\r\nmeanwhile—and rowed to the next ship of the squadron. All hands of that\r\nship are then called to man the rigging, and another portion of the\r\npunishment is inflicted by the boatswain’s mates of that ship. The\r\nbloody shirt is again thrown over the seaman; and thus he is carried\r\nthrough the fleet or squadron till the whole sentence is inflicted.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the launch—the largest of the boats—is rigged with a\r\nplatform (like a headsman’s scaffold), upon which halberds, something\r\nlike those used in the English army, are erected. They consist of two\r\nstout poles, planted upright. Upon the platform stand a Lieutenant, a\r\nSurgeon a Master-at-arms, and the executioners with their “cats.” They\r\nare rowed through the fleet, stopping at each ship, till the whole\r\nsentence is inflicted, as before.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the attending surgeon has professionally interfered\r\nbefore the last lash has been given, alleging that immediate death must\r\nensue if the remainder should be administered without a respite. But\r\ninstead of humanely remitting the remaining lashes, in a case like\r\nthis, the man is generally consigned to his cot for ten or twelve days;\r\nand when the surgeon officially reports him capable of undergoing the\r\nrest of the sentence, it is forthwith inflicted. Shylock must have his\r\npound of flesh.\r\n\r\nTo say, that after being flogged through the fleet, the prisoner’s back\r\nis sometimes puffed up like a pillow; or to say that in other cases it\r\nlooks as if burned black before a roasting fire; or to say that you may\r\ntrack him through the squadron by the blood on the bulwarks of every\r\nship, would only be saying what many seamen have seen.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks, sometimes whole months, elapse before the sailor is\r\nsufficiently recovered to resume his duties. During the greater part of\r\nthat interval he lies in the sick-bay, groaning out his days and\r\nnights; and unless he has the hide and constitution of a rhinoceros, he\r\nnever is the man he was before, but, broken and shattered to the marrow\r\nof his bones, sinks into death before his time. Instances have occurred\r\nwhere he has expired the day after the punishment. No wonder that the\r\nEnglishman, Dr. Granville—himself once a surgeon in the Navy—declares,\r\nin his work on Russia, that the barbarian “knout” itself is not a\r\ngreater torture to undergo than the Navy cat-o’-nine-tails.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a fire broke out near the powder magazine in an American\r\nnational ship, one of the squadron at anchor in the Bay of Naples. The\r\nutmost alarm prevailed. A cry went fore and aft that the ship was about\r\nto blow up. One of the seamen sprang overboard in affright. At length\r\nthe fire was got under, and the man was picked up. He was tried before\r\na court-martial, found guilty of cowardice, and condemned to be flogged\r\nthrough the fleet, In due time the squadron made sail for Algiers, and\r\nin that harbour, once haunted by pirates, the punishment was\r\ninflicted—the Bay of Naples, though washing the shores of an absolute\r\nking, not being deemed a fit place for such an exhibition of American\r\nnaval law.\r\n\r\nWhile the Neversink was in the Pacific, an American sailor, who had\r\ndeposited a vote for General Harrison for President of the United\r\nStates, was flogged through the fleet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIX.\r\nTHE SOCIAL STATE IN A MAN-OF-WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nBur the floggings at the gangway and the floggings through the fleet,\r\nthe stealings, highway robberies, swearings, gamblings, blasphemings,\r\nthimble-riggings, smugglings, and tipplings of a man-of-war, which\r\nthroughout this narrative have been here and there sketched from the\r\nlife, by no means comprise the whole catalogue of evil. One single\r\nfeature is full of significance.\r\n\r\nAll large ships of war carry soldiers, called marines. In the Neversink\r\nthere was something less than fifty, two thirds of whom were Irishmen.\r\nThey were officered by a Lieutenant, an Orderly Sergeant, two\r\nSergeants, and two Corporals, with a drummer and fifer. The custom,\r\ngenerally, is to have a marine to each gun; which rule usually\r\nfurnishes the scale for distributing the soldiers in vessels of\r\ndifferent force.\r\n\r\nOur marines had no other than martial duty to perform; excepting that,\r\nat sea, they stood watches like the sailors, and now and then lazily\r\nassisted in pulling the ropes. But they never put foot in rigging or\r\nhand in tar-bucket.\r\n\r\nOn the quarter-bills, these men were stationed at none of the great\r\nguns; on the station-bills, they had no posts at the ropes. What, then,\r\nwere they for? To serve their country in time of battle? Let us see.\r\nWhen a ship is running into action, her marines generally lie flat on\r\ntheir faces behind the bulwarks (the sailors are sometimes ordered to\r\ndo the same), and when the vessel is fairly engaged, they are usually\r\ndrawn up in the ship’s waist—like a company reviewing in the Park. At\r\nclose quarters, their muskets may pick off a seaman or two in the\r\nrigging, but at long-gun distance they must passively stand in their\r\nranks and be decimated at the enemy’s leisure. Only in one case in\r\nten—that is, when their vessel is attempted to be boarded by a large\r\nparty, are these marines of any essential service as fighting men; with\r\ntheir bayonets they are then called upon to “repel!”\r\n\r\nIf comparatively so useless as soldiers, why have marines at all in the\r\nNavy? Know, then, that what standing armies are to nations, what\r\nturnkeys are to jails, these marines are to the seamen in all large\r\nmen-of-war. Their muskets are their keys. With those muskets they stand\r\nguard over the fresh water; over the grog, when doled; over the\r\nprovisions, when being served out by the Master’s mate; over the “brig”\r\nor jail; at the Commodore’s and Captain’s cabin doors; and, in port, at\r\nboth gangways and forecastle.\r\n\r\nSurely, the crowd of sailors, who besides having so many sea-officers\r\nover them, are thus additionally guarded by soldiers, even when they\r\nquench their thirst—surely these man-of-war’s-men must be desperadoes\r\nindeed; or else the naval service must be so tyrannical that the worst\r\nis feared from their possible insubordination. Either reason holds\r\ngood, or both, according to the character of the officers and crew.\r\n\r\nIt must be evident that the man-of-war’s-man casts but an evil eye on a\r\nmarine. To call a man a “horse-marine,” is, among seamen, one of the\r\ngreatest terms of contempt.\r\n\r\nBut the mutual contempt, and even hatred, subsisting between these two\r\nbodies of men—both clinging to one keel, both lodged in one\r\nhousehold—is held by most Navy officers as the height of the perfection\r\nof Navy discipline. It is regarded as the button that caps the\r\nuttermost point on their main-mast.\r\n\r\nThus they reason: Secure of this antagonism between the marine and the\r\nsailor, we can always rely upon it, that if the sailor mutinies, it\r\nneeds no great incitement for the marine to thrust his bayonet through\r\nhis heart; if the marine revolts, the pike of the sailor is impatient\r\nto charge. Checks and balances, blood against blood, _that_ is the cry\r\nand the argument.\r\n\r\nWhat applies to the relation in which the marine and sailor stand\r\ntoward each other—the mutual repulsion implied by a system of\r\nchecks—will, in degree, apply to nearly the entire interior of a\r\nman-of-war’s discipline. The whole body of this discipline is\r\nemphatically a system of cruel cogs and wheels, systematically grinding\r\nup in one common hopper all that might minister to the moral well-being\r\nof the crew.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with both officers and men. If a Captain have a grudge\r\nagainst a Lieutenant, or a Lieutenant against a midshipman, how easy to\r\ntorture him by official treatment, which shall not lay open the\r\nsuperior officer to legal rebuke. And if a midshipman bears a grudge\r\nagainst a sailor, how easy for him, by cunning practices, born of a\r\nboyish spite, to have him degraded at the gangway. Through all the\r\nendless ramifications of rank and station, in most men-of-war there\r\nruns a sinister vein of bitterness, not exceeded by the fireside\r\nhatreds in a family of stepsons ashore. It were sickening to detail all\r\nthe paltry irritabilities, jealousies, and cabals, the spiteful\r\ndetractions and animosities, that lurk far down, and cling to the very\r\nkelson of the ship. It is unmanning to think of. The immutable\r\nceremonies and iron etiquette of a man-of-war; the spiked barriers\r\nseparating the various grades of rank; the delegated absolutism of\r\nauthority on all hands; the impossibility, on the part of the common\r\nseaman, of appeal from incidental abuses, and many more things that\r\nmight be enumerated, all tend to beget in most armed ships a general\r\nsocial condition which is the precise reverse of what any Christian\r\ncould desire. And though there are vessels, that in some measure\r\nfurnish exceptions to this; and though, in other ships, the thing may\r\nbe glazed over by a guarded, punctilious exterior, almost completely\r\nhiding the truth from casual visitors, while the worst facts touching\r\nthe common sailor are systematically kept in the background, yet it is\r\ncertain that what has here been said of the domestic interior of a\r\nman-of-war will, in a greater or less degree, apply to most vessels in\r\nthe Navy. It is not that the officers are so malevolent, nor,\r\naltogether, that the man-of-war’s-man is so vicious. Some of these\r\nevils are unavoidably generated through the operation of the Naval\r\ncode; others are absolutely organic to a Navy establishment, and, like\r\nother organic evils, are incurable, except when they dissolve with the\r\nbody they live in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XC.\r\nTHE MANNING OF NAVIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The gallows and the sea refuse nothing,” is a very old sea saying;\r\nand, among all the wondrous prints of Hogarth, there is none remaining\r\nmore true at the present day than that dramatic boat-scene, where after\r\nconsorting with harlots and gambling on tomb-stones, the Idle\r\nApprentice, with the villainous low forehead, is at last represented as\r\nbeing pushed off to sea, with a ship and a gallows in the distance. But\r\nHogarth should have converted the ship’s masts themselves into\r\nTyburn-trees, and thus, with the ocean for a background, closed the\r\ncareer of his hero. It would then have had all the dramatic force of\r\nthe opera of Don Juan, who, after running his impious courses, is swept\r\nfrom our sight in a tornado of devils.\r\n\r\nFor the sea is the true Tophet and bottomless pit of many workers of\r\niniquity; and, as the German mystics feign Gehennas within Gehennas,\r\neven so are men-of-war familiarly known among sailors as “Floating\r\nHells.” And as the sea, according to old Fuller, is the stable of brute\r\nmonsters, gliding hither and thither in unspeakable swarms, even so is\r\nit the home of many moral monsters, who fitly divide its empire with\r\nthe snake, the shark, and the worm.\r\n\r\nNor are sailors, and man-of-war’s-men especially, at all blind to a\r\ntrue sense of these things. “_Purser rigged and parish damned_,” is the\r\nsailor saying in the American Navy, when the tyro first mounts the\r\nlined frock and blue jacket, aptly manufactured for him in a State\r\nPrison ashore.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, that lured by some _crimp_ into a service so galling, and,\r\nperhaps, persecuted by a vindictive lieutenant, some repentant sailors\r\nhave actually jumped into the sea to escape from their fate, or set\r\nthemselves adrift on the wide ocean on the gratings without compass or\r\nrudder.\r\n\r\nIn one case, a young man, after being nearly cut into dog’s meat at the\r\ngangway, loaded his pockets with shot and walked overboard.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, I was in a whaling ship lying in a harbour of the\r\nPacific, with three French men-of-war alongside. One dark, moody night,\r\na suppressed cry was heard from the face of the waters, and, thinking\r\nit was some one drowning, a boat was lowered, when two French sailors\r\nwere picked up, half dead from exhaustion, and nearly throttled by a\r\nbundle of their clothes tied fast to their shoulders. In this manner\r\nthey had attempted their escape from their vessel. When the French\r\nofficers came in pursuit, these sailors, rallying from their\r\nexhaustion, fought like tigers to resist being captured. Though this\r\nstory concerns a French armed ship, it is not the less applicable, in\r\ndegree, to those of other nations.\r\n\r\nMix with the men in an American armed ship, mark how many foreigners\r\nthere are, though it is against the law to enlist them. Nearly one\r\nthird of the petty officers of the Neversink were born east of the\r\nAtlantic. Why is this? Because the same principle that operates in\r\nhindering Americans from hiring themselves out as menial domestics also\r\nrestrains them, in a great measure, from voluntarily assuming a far\r\nworse servitude in the Navy. “_Sailors wanted for the Navy_” is a\r\ncommon announcement along the wharves of our sea-ports. They are always\r\n“_wanted_.” It may have been, in part, owing to this scarcity\r\nman-of-war’s men, that not many years ago, black slaves were frequently\r\nto be found regularly enlisted with the crew of an American frigate,\r\ntheir masters receiving their pay. This was in the teeth of a law of\r\nCongress expressly prohibiting slaves in the Navy. This law,\r\nindirectly, means black slaves, nothing being said concerning white\r\nones. But in view of what John Randolph of Roanoke said about the\r\nfrigate that carried him to Russia, and in view of what most armed\r\nvessels actually are at present, the American Navy is not altogether an\r\ninappropriate place for hereditary bondmen. Still, the circumstance of\r\ntheir being found in it is of such a nature, that to some it may hardly\r\nappear credible. The incredulity of such persons, nevertheless, must\r\nyield to the fact, that on board of the United States ship Neversink,\r\nduring the present cruise, there was a Virginian slave regularly\r\nshipped as a seaman, his owner receiving his wages. Guinea—such was his\r\nname among the crew—belonged to the Purser, who was a Southern\r\ngentleman; he was employed as his body servant. Never did I feel my\r\ncondition as a man-of-war’s-man so keenly as when seeing this Guinea\r\nfreely circulating about the decks in citizen’s clothes, and through\r\nthe influence of his master, almost entirely exempted from the\r\ndisciplinary degradation of the Caucasian crew. Faring sumptuously in\r\nthe ward-room; sleek and round, his ebon face fairly polished with\r\ncontent: ever gay and hilarious; ever ready to laugh and joke, that\r\nAfrican slave was actually envied by many of the seamen. There were\r\ntimes when I almost envied him myself. Lemsford once envied him\r\noutright, “Ah, Guinea!” he sighed, “you have peaceful times; you never\r\nopened the book I read in.”\r\n\r\nOne morning, when all hands were called to witness punishment, the\r\nPurser’s slave, as usual, was observed to be hurrying down the ladders\r\ntoward the ward-room, his face wearing that peculiar, pinched blueness,\r\nwhich, in the negro, answers to the paleness caused by nervous\r\nagitation in the white. “Where are you going, Guinea?” cried the\r\ndeck-officer, a humorous gentleman, who sometimes diverted himself with\r\nthe Purser’s slave, and well knew what answer he would now receive from\r\nhim. “Where are you going, Guinea?” said this officer; “turn about;\r\ndon’t you hear the call, sir?” “’_Scuse_ me, massa!” said the slave,\r\nwith a low salutation; “I can’t ’tand it; I can’t, indeed, massa!” and,\r\nso saying, he disappeared beyond the hatchway. He was the only person\r\non board, except the hospital-steward and the invalids of the sick-bay,\r\nwho was exempted from being present at the administering of the\r\nscourge. Accustomed to light and easy duties from his birth, and so\r\nfortunate as to meet with none but gentle masters, Guinea, though a\r\nbondman, liable to be saddled with a mortgage, like a horse—Guinea, in\r\nIndia-rubber manacles, enjoyed the liberties of the world.\r\n\r\nThough his body-and-soul proprietor, the Purser, never in any way\r\nindividualised me while I served on board the frigate, and never did me\r\na good office of any kind (it was hardly in his power), yet, from his\r\npleasant, kind, indulgent manner toward his slave, I always imputed to\r\nhim a generous heart, and cherished an involuntary friendliness toward\r\nhim. Upon our arrival home, his treatment of Guinea, under\r\ncircumstances peculiarly calculated to stir up the resentment of a\r\nslave-owner, still more augmented my estimation of the Purser’s good\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the number of foreigners in the American Navy;\r\nbut it is not in the American Navy alone that foreigners bear so large\r\na proportion to the rest of the crew, though in no navy, perhaps, have\r\nthey ever borne so large a proportion as in our own. According to an\r\nEnglish estimate, the foreigners serving in the King’s ships at one\r\ntime amounted to one eighth of the entire body of seamen. How it is in\r\nthe French Navy, I cannot with certainty say; but I have repeatedly\r\nsailed with English seamen who have served in it.\r\n\r\nOne of the effects of the free introduction of foreigners into any Navy\r\ncannot be sufficiently deplored. During the period I lived in the\r\nNeversink, I was repeatedly struck by the lack of patriotism in many of\r\nmy shipmates. True, they were mostly foreigners who unblushingly\r\navowed, that were it not for the difference of pay, they would as lief\r\nman the guns of an English ship as those of an American or Frenchman.\r\nNevertheless, it was evident, that as for any high-toned patriotic\r\nfeeling, there was comparatively very little—hardly any of it—evinced\r\nby our sailors as a body. Upon reflection, this was not to be wondered\r\nat. From their roving career, and the sundering of all domestic ties,\r\nmany sailors, all the world over, are like the “Free Companions,” who\r\nsome centuries ago wandered over Europe, ready to fight the battles of\r\nany prince who could purchase their swords. The only patriotism is born\r\nand nurtured in a stationary home, and upon an immovable hearth-stone;\r\nbut the man-of-war’s-man, though in his voyagings he weds the two Poles\r\nand brings both Indies together, yet, let him wander where he will, he\r\ncarries his one only home along with him: that home is his hammock.\r\n“_Born under a gun, and educated on the bowsprit_,” according to a\r\nphrase of his own, the man-of-war-man rolls round the world like a\r\nbillow, ready to mix with any sea, or be sucked down to death in the\r\nmaelstrom of any war.\r\n\r\nYet more. The dread of the general discipline of a man-of-war; the\r\nspecial obnoxiousness of the gangway; the protracted confinement on\r\nboard ship, with so few “liberty days;” and the pittance of pay (much\r\nless than what can always be had in the Merchant Service), these things\r\ncontrive to deter from the navies of all countries by far the majority\r\nof their best seamen. This will be obvious, when the following\r\nstatistical facts, taken from Macpherson’s Annals of Commerce, are\r\nconsidered. At one period, upon the Peace Establishment, the number of\r\nmen employed in the English Navy was 25,000; at the same time, the\r\nEnglish Merchant Service was employing 118,952. But while the\r\nnecessities of a merchantman render it indispensable that the greater\r\npart of her crew be able seamen, the circumstances of a man-of-war\r\nadmit of her mustering a crowd of landsmen, soldiers, and boys in her\r\nservice. By a statement of Captain Marryat’s, in his pamphlet (A. D.\r\n1822) “On the Abolition of Impressment,” it appears that, at the close\r\nof the Bonaparte wars, a full third of all the crews of his Majesty’s\r\nfleets consisted of landsmen and boys.\r\n\r\nFar from entering with enthusiasm into the king’s ships when their\r\ncountry were menaced, the great body of English seamen, appalled at the\r\ndiscipline of the Navy, adopted unheard-of devices to escape its\r\npress-gangs. Some even hid themselves in caves, and lonely places\r\ninland, fearing to run the risk of seeking a berth in an outward-bound\r\nmerchantman, that might have carried them beyond sea. In the true\r\nnarrative of “John Nichol, Mariner,” published in 1822 by Blackwood in\r\nEdinburgh, and Cadell in London, and which everywhere bears the\r\nspontaneous impress of truth, the old sailor, in the most artless,\r\ntouching, and almost uncomplaining manner, tells of his “skulking like\r\na thief” for whole years in the country round about Edinburgh, to avoid\r\nthe press-gangs, prowling through the land like bandits and Burkers. At\r\nthis time (Bonaparte’s wars), according to “Steel’s List,” there were\r\nforty-five regular press-gang stations in Great Britain.[6]\r\n\r\n [6] Besides this domestic kidnapping, British frigates, in friendly or\r\n neutral harbours, in some instances pressed into their service foreign\r\n sailors of all nations from the public wharves. In certain cases,\r\n where Americans were concerned, when “_protections_” were found upon\r\n their persons, these were destroyed; and to prevent the American\r\n consul from claiming his sailor countrymen, the press-gang generally\r\n went on shore the night previous to the sailing of the frigate, so\r\n that the kidnapped seamen were far out to sea before they could be\r\n missed by their friends. These things should be known; for in case the\r\n English government again goes to war with its fleets, and should again\r\n resort to indiscriminate impressment to man them, it is well that both\r\n Englishmen and Americans, that all the world be prepared to put down\r\n an iniquity outrageous and insulting to God and man.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a later instance, a large body of British seamen solemnly assembled\r\nupon the eve of an anticipated war, and together determined, that in\r\ncase of its breaking out, they would at once flee to America, to avoid\r\nbeing pressed into the service of their country—a service which\r\ndegraded her own guardians at the gangway.\r\n\r\nAt another time, long previous to this, according to an English Navy\r\nofficer, Lieutenant Tomlinson, three thousand seamen, impelled by the\r\nsame motive, fled ashore in a panic from the colliers between Yarmouth\r\nRoads and the Nore. Elsewhere, he says, in speaking of some of the men\r\non board the king’s ships, that “they were most miserable objects.”\r\nThis remark is perfectly corroborated by other testimony referring to\r\nanother period. In alluding to the lamented scarcity of good English\r\nseamen during the wars of 1808, etc., the author of a pamphlet on\r\n“Naval Subjects” says, that all the best seamen, the steadiest and\r\nbest-behaved men, generally succeeded in avoiding the impress. This\r\nwriter was, or had been, himself a Captain in the British fleet.\r\n\r\nNow it may be easily imagined who are the men, and of what moral\r\ncharacter they are, who, even at the present day, are willing to enlist\r\nas full-grown adults in a service so galling to all shore-manhood as\r\nthe Navy. Hence it comes that the skulkers and scoundrels of all sorts\r\nin a man-of-war are chiefly composed not of regular seamen, but of\r\nthese “dock-lopers” of landsmen, men who enter the Navy to draw their\r\ngrog and murder their time in the notorious idleness of a frigate. But\r\nif so idle, why not reduce the number of a man-of-war’s crew, and\r\nreasonably keep employed the rest? It cannot be done. In the first\r\nplace, the magnitude of most of these ships requires a large number of\r\nhands to brace the heavy yards, hoist the enormous top-sails, and weigh\r\nthe ponderous anchor. And though the occasion for the employment of so\r\nmany men comes but seldom, it is true, yet when that occasion _does_\r\ncome—and come it may at any moment—this multitude of men are\r\nindispensable.\r\n\r\nBut besides this, and to crown all, the batteries must be manned. There\r\nmust be enough men to work all the guns at one time. And thus, in order\r\nto have a sufficiency of mortals at hand to “sink, burn and destroy;” a\r\nman-of-war, through her vices, hopelessly depraving the volunteer\r\nlandsmen and ordinary seamen of good habits, who occasionally\r\nenlist—must feed at the public cost a multitude of persons, who, if\r\nthey did not find a home in the Navy, would probably fall on the\r\nparish, or linger out their days in a prison.\r\n\r\nAmong others, these are the men into whose mouths Dibdin puts his\r\npatriotic verses, full of sea-chivalry and romance. With an exception\r\nin the last line, they might be sung with equal propriety by both\r\nEnglish and American man-of-war’s-men.\r\n\r\n     “As for me, in all weathers, all times, tides, and ends,\r\n          Naught’s a trouble from duty that springs;\r\n      For my heart is my Poll’s, and my rhino’s my friends,\r\n          And as for my life, it’s the king’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n      To rancour unknown, to no passion a slave,\r\n          Nor unmanly, nor mean, nor a railer,” etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not unite with a high critical authority in considering Dibdin’s\r\nditties as “slang songs,” for most of them breathe the very poetry of\r\nthe ocean. But it is remarkable that those songs—which would lead one\r\nto think that man-of-war’s-men are the most care-free, contented,\r\nvirtuous, and patriotic of mankind—were composed at a time when the\r\nEnglish Navy was principally manned by felons and paupers, as mentioned\r\nin a former chapter. Still more, these songs are pervaded by a true\r\nMohammedan sensualism; a reckless acquiescence in fate, and an\r\nimplicit, unquestioning, dog-like devotion to whoever may be lord and\r\nmaster. Dibdin was a man of genius; but no wonder Dibdin was a\r\ngovernment pensioner at £200 per annum.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the iniquities of a man-of-war, men are to be found\r\nin them, at times, so used to a hard life; so drilled and disciplined\r\nto servitude, that, with an incomprehensible philosophy, they seem\r\ncheerfully to resign themselves to their fate. They have plenty to eat;\r\nspirits to drink; clothing to keep them warm; a hammock to sleep in;\r\ntobacco to chew; a doctor to medicine them; a parson to pray for them;\r\nand, to a penniless castaway, must not all this seem as a luxurious\r\nBill of Fare?\r\n\r\nThere was on board of the Neversink a fore-top-man by the name of\r\nLandless, who, though his back was cross-barred, and plaided with the\r\nineffaceable scars of all the floggings accumulated by a reckless tar\r\nduring a ten years’ service in the Navy, yet he perpetually wore a\r\nhilarious face, and at joke and repartee was a very Joe Miller.\r\n\r\nThat man, though a sea-vagabond, was not created in vain. He enjoyed\r\nlife with the zest of everlasting adolescence; and, though cribbed in\r\nan oaken prison, with the turnkey sentries all round him, yet he paced\r\nthe gun-deck as if it were broad as a prairie, and diversified in\r\nlandscape as the hills and valleys of the Tyrol. Nothing ever\r\ndisconcerted him; nothing could transmute his laugh into anything like\r\na sigh. Those glandular secretions, which in other captives sometimes\r\ngo to the formation of tears, in _him_ were expectorated from the\r\nmouth, tinged with the golden juice of a weed, wherewith he solaced and\r\ncomforted his ignominious days.\r\n\r\n“Rum and tobacco!” said Landless, “what more does a sailor want?”\r\n\r\nHis favourite song was “_Dibdin’s True English Sailor_,” beginning,\r\n\r\n     “Jack dances and sings, and is always content,\r\n          In his vows to his lass he’ll ne’er fail her;\r\n      His anchor’s atrip when his money’s all spent,\r\n          And this is the life of a sailor.”\r\n\r\n\r\nBut poor Landless danced quite as often at the gangway, under the lash,\r\nas in the sailor dance-houses ashore.\r\n\r\nAnother of his songs, also set to the significant tune of _The King,\r\nGod bless him!_ mustered the following lines among many similar ones:\r\n\r\n     “Oh, when safely landed in Boston or ’York,\r\n          Oh how I will tipple and jig it;\r\n      And toss off my glass while my rhino holds out,\r\n          In drinking success to our frigate!”\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the many idle hours when our frigate was lying in harbour, this\r\nman was either merrily playing at checkers, or mending his clothes, or\r\nsnoring like a trumpeter under the lee of the booms. When fast asleep,\r\na national salute from our batteries could hardly move him. Whether\r\nordered to the main-truck in a gale; or rolled by the drum to the\r\ngrog-tub; or commanded to walk up to the gratings and be lashed,\r\nLandess always obeyed with the same invincible indifference.\r\n\r\nHis advice to a young lad, who shipped with us at Valparaiso, embodies\r\nthe pith and marrow of that philosophy which enables some\r\nman-of-war’s-men to wax jolly in the service.\r\n\r\n“_Shippy!_” said Landless, taking the pale lad by his neckerchief, as\r\nif he had him by the halter; “Shippy, I’ve seen sarvice with Uncle\r\nSam—I’ve sailed in many _Andrew Millers_. Now take my advice, and steer\r\nclear of all trouble. D’ye see, touch your tile whenever a swob\r\n(officer) speaks to you. And never mind how much they rope’s-end you,\r\nkeep your red-rag belayed; for you must know as how they don’t fancy\r\nsea-lawyers; and when the sarving out of slops comes round, stand up to\r\nit stiffly; it’s only an oh Lord! Or two, and a few oh my Gods!—that’s\r\nall. And what then? Why, you sleeps it off in a few nights, and turn\r\nout at last all ready for your grog.”\r\n\r\nThis Landless was a favourite with the officers, among whom he went by\r\nthe name of “_Happy Jack_.” And it is just such Happy Jacks as Landless\r\nthat most sea-officers profess to admire; a fellow without shame,\r\nwithout a soul, so dead to the least dignity of manhood that he could\r\nhardly be called a man. Whereas, a seaman who exhibits traits of moral\r\nsensitiveness, whose demeanour shows some dignity within; this is the\r\nman they, in many cases, instinctively dislike. The reason is, they\r\nfeel such a man to be a continual reproach to them, as being mentally\r\nsuperior to their power. He has no business in a man-of-war; they do\r\nnot want such men. To them there is an insolence in his manly freedom,\r\ncontempt in his very carriage. He is unendurable, as an erect,\r\nlofty-minded African would be to some slave-driving planter.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed, however, that the remarks in this and the\r\npreceding chapter apply to _all_ men-of-war. There are some vessels\r\nblessed with patriarchal, intellectual Captains, gentlemanly and\r\nbrotherly officers, and docile and Christianised crews. The peculiar\r\nusages of such vessels insensibly softens the tyrannical rigour of the\r\nArticles of War; in them, scourging is unknown. To sail in such ships\r\nis hardly to realise that you live under the martial law, or that the\r\nevils above mentioned can anywhere exist.\r\n\r\nAnd Jack Chase, old Ushant, and several more fine tars that might be\r\nadded, sufficiently attest, that in the Neversink at least, there was\r\nmore than one noble man-of-war’s-man who almost redeemed all the rest.\r\n\r\nWherever, throughout this narrative, the American Navy, in any of its\r\nbearings, has formed the theme of a general discussion, hardly one\r\nsyllable of admiration for what is accounted illustrious in its\r\nachievements has been permitted to escape me. The reason is this: I\r\nconsider, that so far as what is called military renown is concerned,\r\nthe American Navy needs no eulogist but History. It were superfluous\r\nfor White-Jacket to tell the world what it knows already. The office\r\nimposed upon me is of another cast; and, though I foresee and feel that\r\nit may subject me to the pillory in the hard thoughts of some men, yet,\r\nsupported by what God has given me, I tranquilly abide the event,\r\nwhatever it may prove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCI.\r\nSMOKING-CLUB IN A MAN-OF-WAR, WITH SCENES ON THE GUN-DECK DRAWING NEAR\r\nHOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a fable about a painter moved by Jove to the painting of the\r\nhead of Medusa. Though the picture was true to the life, yet the poor\r\nartist sickened at the sight of what his forced pencil had drawn. Thus,\r\nborne through my task toward the end, my own soul now sinks at what I\r\nmyself have portrayed. But let us forget past chapters, if we may,\r\nwhile we paint less repugnant things.\r\n\r\nMetropolitan gentlemen have their club; provincial gossipers their\r\nnews-room; village quidnuncs their barber’s shop; the Chinese their\r\nopium-houses; American Indians their council-fire; and even cannibals\r\ntheir _Noojona_, or Talk-Stone, where they assemble at times to discuss\r\nthe affairs of the day. Nor is there any government, however despotic,\r\nthat ventures to deny to the least of its subjects the privilege of a\r\nsociable chat. Not the Thirty Tyrants even—the clubbed post-captains of\r\nold Athens—could stop the wagging tongues at the street-corners. For\r\nchat man must; and by our immortal Bill of Rights, that guarantees to\r\nus liberty of speech, chat we Yankees will, whether on board a frigate,\r\nor on board our own terra-firma plantations.\r\n\r\nIn men-of-war, the Galley, or Cookery, on the gun-deck, is the grand\r\ncentre of gossip and news among the sailors. Here crowds assemble to\r\nchat away the half-hour elapsing after every meal. The reason why this\r\nplace and these hours are selected rather than others is this: in the\r\nneighbourhood of the galley alone, and only after meals, is the\r\nman-of-war’s-man permitted to regale himself with a smoke.\r\n\r\nA sumptuary edict, truly, that deprived White-Jacket, for one, of a\r\nluxury to which he had long been attached. For how can the mystical\r\nmotives, the capricious impulses of a luxurious smoker go and come at\r\nthe beck of a Commodore’s command? No! when I smoke, be it because of\r\nmy sovereign good pleasure I choose so to do, though at so unseasonable\r\nan hour that I send round the town for a brasier of coals. What! smoke\r\nby a sun-dial? Smoke on compulsion? Make a trade, a business, a vile\r\nrecurring calling of smoking? And, perhaps, when those sedative fumes\r\nhave steeped you in the grandest of reveries, and, circle over circle,\r\nsolemnly rises some immeasurable dome in your soul—far away, swelling\r\nand heaving into the vapour you raise—as if from one Mozart’s grandest\r\nmarches of a temple were rising, like Venus from the sea—at such a\r\ntime, to have your whole Parthenon tumbled about your ears by the knell\r\nof the ship’s bell announcing the expiration of the half-hour for\r\nsmoking! Whip me, ye Furies! toast me in saltpetre! smite me, some\r\nthunderbolt! charge upon me, endless squadrons of Mamalukes! devour me,\r\nFeejees! but preserve me from a tyranny like this!\r\n\r\nNo! though I smoked like an Indian summer ere I entered the Neversink,\r\nso abhorrent was this sumptuary law that I altogether abandoned the\r\nluxury rather than enslave it to a time and a place. Herein did I not\r\nright, Ancient and Honourable Old Guard of Smokers all round the world?\r\n\r\nBut there were others of the crew not so fastidious as myself. After\r\nevery meal, they hied to the galley and solaced their souls with a\r\nwhiff.\r\n\r\nNow a bunch of cigars, all banded together, is a type and a symbol of\r\nthe brotherly love between smokers. Likewise, for the time, in a\r\ncommunity of pipes is a community of hearts! Nor was it an ill thing\r\nfor the Indian Sachems to circulate their calumet tobacco-bowl—even as\r\nour own forefathers circulated their punch-bowl—in token of peace,\r\ncharity, and good-will, friendly feelings, and sympathising souls. And\r\nthis it was that made the gossipers of the galley so loving a club, so\r\nlong as the vapoury bond united them.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant sight to behold them. Grouped in the recesses between\r\nthe guns, they chatted and laughed like rows of convivialists in the\r\nboxes of some vast dining-saloon. Take a Flemish kitchen full of good\r\nfellows from Teniers; add a fireside group from Wilkie; throw in a\r\nnaval sketch from Cruickshank; and then stick a short pipe into every\r\nmother’s son’s mouth, and you have the smoking scene at the galley of\r\nthe Neversink.\r\n\r\nNot a few were politicians; and, as there were some thoughts of a war\r\nwith England at the time, their discussions waxed warm.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what it is, _shippies!_” cried the old captain of gun No. 1\r\non the forecastle, “if that ’ere President of ourn don’t luff up into\r\nthe wind, by the Battle of the Nile! he’ll be getting us into a grand\r\nfleet engagement afore the Yankee nation has rammed home her\r\ncartridges—let alone blowing the match!”\r\n\r\n“Who talks of luffing?” roared a roystering fore-top-man. “Keep our\r\nYankee nation large before the wind, say I, till you come plump on the\r\nenemy’s bows, and then board him in the smoke,” and with that, there\r\ncame forth a mighty blast from his pipe.\r\n\r\n“Who says the old man at the helm of the Yankee nation can’t steer his\r\n_trick_ as well as George Washington himself?” cried a\r\nsheet-anchor-man.\r\n\r\n“But they say he’s a cold-water customer, Bill,” cried another; “and\r\nsometimes o’ nights I somehow has a presentation that he’s goin’ to\r\nstop our grog.”\r\n\r\n“D’ye hear there, fore and aft!” roared the boatswain’s mate at the\r\ngangway, “all hands tumble up, and ’bout ship!”\r\n\r\n“That’s the talk!” cried the captain of gun No. 1, as, in obedience to\r\nthe summons, all hands dropped their pipes and crowded toward the\r\nladders, “and that’s what the President must do—go in stays, my lads,\r\nand put the Yankee nation on the other tack.”\r\n\r\nBut these political discussions by no means supplied the staple of\r\nconversation for the gossiping smokers of the galley. The interior\r\naffairs of the frigate itself formed their principal theme. Rumours\r\nabout the private life of the Commodore in his cabin; about the\r\nCaptain, in his; about the various officers in the ward-room; about the\r\n_reefers_ in the steerage, and their madcap frolickings, and about a\r\nthousand other matters touching the crew themselves; all these—forming\r\nthe eternally shifting, domestic by-play of a man-of-war—proved\r\ninexhaustible topics for our quidnuncs.\r\n\r\nThe animation of these scenes was very much heightened as we drew\r\nnearer and nearer our port; it rose to a climax when the frigate was\r\nreported to be only twenty-four hours’ sail from the land. What they\r\nshould do when they landed; how they should invest their wages; what\r\nthey should eat; what they should drink; and what lass they should\r\nmarry—these were the topics which absorbed them.\r\n\r\n“Sink the sea!” cried a forecastle man. “Once more ashore, and you’ll\r\nnever again catch old Boombolt afloat. I mean to settle down in a\r\nsail-loft.”\r\n\r\n“Cable-tier pinchers blister all tarpaulin hats!” cried a young\r\nafter-guard’s-man; “I mean to go back to the counter.”\r\n\r\n“Shipmates! take me by the arms, and swab up the lee-scuppers with me,\r\nbut I mean to steer a clam-cart before I go again to a ship’s wheel.\r\nLet the Navy go by the board—to sea again, I won’t!”\r\n\r\n“Start my soul-bolts, maties, if any more Blue Peters and sailing\r\nsignals fly at my fore!” cried the Captain of the Head. “My wages will\r\nbuy a wheelbarrow, if nothing more.”\r\n\r\n“I have taken my last dose of salts,” said the Captain of the Waist,\r\n“and after this mean to stick to fresh water. Ay, maties, ten of us\r\nWaisters mean to club together and buy a _serving-mallet boat_, d’ye\r\nsee; and if ever we drown, it will be in the ‘raging canal!’ Blast the\r\nsea, shipmates! say I.”\r\n\r\n“Profane not the holy element!” said Lemsford, the poet of the\r\ngun-deck, leaning over a cannon. “Know ye not, man-of-war’s-men! that\r\nby the Parthian magi the ocean was held sacred? Did not Tiridates, the\r\nEastern monarch, take an immense land circuit to avoid desecrating the\r\nMediterranean, in order to reach his imperial master, Nero, and do\r\nhomage for his crown?”\r\n\r\n“What lingo is that?” cried the Captain of the Waist.\r\n\r\n“Who’s Commodore Tiddery-eye?” cried the forecastle-man.\r\n\r\n“Hear me out,” resumed Lemsford. “Like Tiridates, I venerate the sea,\r\nand venerate it so highly, shipmates, that evermore I shall abstain\r\nfrom crossing it. In _that_ sense, Captain of the Waist, I echo your\r\ncry.”\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a remarkable fact, that nine men out of every ten of\r\nthe Neversink’s crew had formed some plan or other to keep themselves\r\nashore for life, or, at least, on fresh water, after the expiration of\r\nthe present cruise. With all the experiences of that cruise accumulated\r\nin one intense recollection of a moment; with the smell of tar in their\r\nnostrils; out of sight of land; with a stout ship under foot, and\r\nsnuffing the ocean air; with all the things of the sea surrounding\r\nthem; in their cool, sober moments of reflection; in the silence and\r\nsolitude of the deep, during the long night-watches, when all their\r\nholy home associations were thronging round their hearts; in the\r\nspontaneous piety and devotion of the last hours of so long a voyage;\r\nin the fullness and the frankness of their souls; when there was naught\r\nto jar the well-poised equilibrium of their judgment—under all these\r\ncircumstances, at least nine tenths of a crew of five hundred\r\nman-of-war’s-men resolved for ever to turn their backs on the sea. But\r\ndo men ever hate the thing they love? Do men forswear the hearth and\r\nthe homestead? What, then, must the Navy be?\r\n\r\nBut, alas for the man-of-war’s-man, who, though he may take a Hannibal\r\noath against the service; yet, cruise after cruise, and after\r\nforswearing it again and again, he is driven back to the spirit-tub and\r\nthe gun-deck by his old hereditary foe, the ever-devilish god of grog.\r\n\r\nOn this point, let some of the crew of the Neversink be called to the\r\nstand.\r\n\r\nYou, Captain of the Waist! and you, seamen of the fore-top! and you,\r\nafter-guard’s-men and others! how came you here at the guns of the\r\nNorth Carolina, after registering your solemn vows at the galley of the\r\nNeversink?\r\n\r\nThey all hang their heads. I know the cause; poor fellows! perjure\r\nyourselves not again; swear not at all hereafter.\r\n\r\nAy, these very tars—the foremost in denouncing the Navy; who had bound\r\nthemselves by the most tremendous oaths—these very men, not three days\r\nafter getting ashore, were rolling round the streets in penniless\r\ndrunkenness; and next day many of them were to be found on board of the\r\n_guardo_ or receiving-ship. Thus, in part, is the Navy manned.\r\n\r\nBut what was still more surprising, and tended to impart a new and\r\nstrange insight into the character of sailors, and overthrow some\r\nlong-established ideas concerning them as a class, was this: numbers of\r\nmen who, during the cruise, had passed for exceedingly prudent, nay,\r\nparsimonious persons, who would even refuse you a patch, or a needleful\r\nof thread, and, from their stinginess, procured the name of\r\n_Ravelings_—no sooner were these men fairly adrift in harbour, and\r\nunder the influence of frequent quaffings, than their\r\nthree-years’-earned wages flew right and left; they summoned whole\r\nboarding-houses of sailors to the bar, and treated them over and over\r\nagain. Fine fellows! generous-hearted tars! Seeing this sight, I\r\nthought to myself, Well, these generous-hearted tars on shore were the\r\ngreatest curmudgeons afloat! it’s the bottle that’s generous, not they!\r\nYet the popular conceit concerning a sailor is derived from his\r\nbehaviour ashore; whereas, ashore he is no longer a sailor, but a\r\nlandsman for the time. A man-of-war’s-man is only a man-of-war’s-man at\r\nsea; and the sea is the place to learn what he is. But we have seen\r\nthat a man-of-war is but this old-fashioned world of ours afloat, full\r\nof all manner of characters—full of strange contradictions; and though\r\nboasting some fine fellows here and there, yet, upon the whole, charged\r\nto the combings of her hatchways with the spirit of Belial and all\r\nunrighteousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCII.\r\nTHE LAST OF THE JACKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlready has White-Jacket chronicled the mishaps and inconveniences,\r\ntroubles and tribulations of all sorts brought upon him by that\r\nunfortunate but indispensable garment of his. But now it befalls him to\r\nrecord how this jacket, for the second and last time, came near proving\r\nhis shroud.\r\n\r\nOf a pleasant midnight, our good frigate, now somewhere off the Capes\r\nof Virginia, was running on bravely, when the breeze, gradually dying,\r\nleft us slowly gliding toward our still invisible port.\r\n\r\nHeaded by Jack Chase, the quarter-watch were reclining in the top,\r\ntalking about the shore delights into which they intended to plunge,\r\nwhile our captain often broke in with allusions to similar\r\nconversations when he was on board the English line-of-battle ship, the\r\nAsia, drawing nigh to Portsmouth, in England, after the battle of\r\nNavarino.\r\n\r\nSuddenly an order was given to set the main-top-gallant-stun’-sail, and\r\nthe halyards not being rove, Jack Chase assigned to me that duty. Now\r\nthis reeving of the halyards of a main-top-gallant-stun’-sail is a\r\nbusiness that eminently demands sharpsightedness, skill, and celerity.\r\n\r\nConsider that the end of a line, some two hundred feet long, is to be\r\ncarried aloft, in your teeth, if you please, and dragged far out on the\r\ngiddiest of yards, and after being wormed and twisted about through all\r\nsorts of intricacies—turning abrupt corners at the abruptest of\r\nangles—is to be dropped, clear of all obstructions, in a straight\r\nplumb-line right down to the deck. In the course of this business,\r\nthere is a multitude of sheeve-holes and blocks, through which you must\r\npass it; often the rope is a very tight fit, so as to make it like\r\nthreading a fine cambric needle with rather coarse thread. Indeed, it\r\nis a thing only deftly to be done, even by day. Judge, then, what it\r\nmust be to be threading cambric needles by night, and at sea, upward of\r\na hundred feet aloft in the air.\r\n\r\nWith the end of the line in one hand, I was mounting the top-mast\r\nshrouds, when our Captain of the Top told me that I had better off\r\njacket; but though it was not a very cold night, I had been reclining\r\nso long in the top, that I had become somewhat chilly, so I thought\r\nbest not to comply with the hint.\r\n\r\nHaving reeved the line through all the inferior blocks, I went out with\r\nit to the end of the weather-top-gallant-yard-arm, and was in the act\r\nof leaning over and passing it through the suspended jewel-block there,\r\nwhen the ship gave a plunge in the sudden swells of the calm sea, and\r\npitching me still further over the yard, threw the heavy skirts of my\r\njacket right over my head, completely muffling me. Somehow I thought it\r\nwas the sail that had flapped, and, under that impression, threw up my\r\nhands to drag it from my head, relying upon the sail itself to support\r\nme meanwhile. Just then the ship gave another sudden jerk, and,\r\nhead-foremost, I pitched from the yard. I knew where I was, from the\r\nrush of the air by my ears, but all else was a nightmare. A bloody film\r\nwas before my eyes, through which, ghost-like, passed and repassed my\r\nfather, mother, and sisters. An utterable nausea oppressed me; I was\r\nconscious of gasping; there seemed no breath in my body. It was over\r\none hundred feet that I fell—down, down, with lungs collapsed as in\r\ndeath. Ten thousand pounds of shot seemed tied to my head, as the\r\nirresistible law of gravitation dragged me, head foremost and straight\r\nas a die, toward the infallible centre of this terraqueous globe. All I\r\nhad seen, and read, and heard, and all I had thought and felt in my\r\nlife, seemed intensified in one fixed idea in my soul. But dense as\r\nthis idea was, it was made up of atoms. Having fallen from the\r\nprojecting yard-arm end, I was conscious of a collected satisfaction in\r\nfeeling, that I should not be dashed on the deck, but would sink into\r\nthe speechless profound of the sea.\r\n\r\nWith the bloody, blind film before my eyes, there was a still stranger\r\nhum in my head, as if a hornet were there; and I thought to myself,\r\nGreat God! this is Death! Yet these thoughts were unmixed with alarm.\r\nLike frost-work that flashes and shifts its scared hues in the sun, all\r\nmy braided, blended emotions were in themselves icy cold and calm.\r\n\r\nSo protracted did my fall seem, that I can even now recall the feeling\r\nof wondering how much longer it would be, ere all was over and I\r\nstruck. Time seemed to stand still, and all the worlds seemed poised on\r\ntheir poles, as I fell, soul-becalmed, through the eddying whirl and\r\nswirl of the maelstrom air.\r\n\r\nAt first, as I have said, I must have been precipitated head-foremost;\r\nbut I was conscious, at length, of a swift, flinging motion of my\r\nlimbs, which involuntarily threw themselves out, so that at last I must\r\nhave fallen in a heap. This is more likely, from the circumstance, that\r\nwhen I struck the sea, I felt as if some one had smote me slantingly\r\nacross the shoulder and along part of my right side.\r\n\r\nAs I gushed into the sea, a thunder-boom sounded in my ear; my soul\r\nseemed flying from my mouth. The feeling of death flooded over me with\r\nthe billows. The blow from the sea must have turned me, so that I sank\r\nalmost feet foremost through a soft, seething foamy lull. Some current\r\nseemed hurrying me away; in a trance I yielded, and sank deeper down\r\nwith a glide. Purple and pathless was the deep calm now around me,\r\nflecked by summer lightnings in an azure afar. The horrible nausea was\r\ngone; the bloody, blind film turned a pale green; I wondered whether I\r\nwas yet dead, or still dying. But of a sudden some fashionless form\r\nbrushed my side—some inert, coiled fish of the sea; the thrill of being\r\nalive again tingled in my nerves, and the strong shunning of death\r\nshocked me through.\r\n\r\nFor one instant an agonising revulsion came over me as I found myself\r\nutterly sinking. Next moment the force of my fall was expanded; and\r\nthere I hung, vibrating in the mid-deep. What wild sounds then rang in\r\nmy ear! One was a soft moaning, as of low waves on the beach; the other\r\nwild and heartlessly jubilant, as of the sea in the height of a\r\ntempest. Oh soul! thou then heardest life and death: as he who stands\r\nupon the Corinthian shore hears both the Ionian and the Aegean waves.\r\nThe life-and-death poise soon passed; and then I found myself slowly\r\nascending, and caught a dim glimmering of light.\r\n\r\nQuicker and quicker I mounted; till at last I bounded up like a buoy,\r\nand my whole head was bathed in the blessed air.\r\n\r\nI had fallen in a line with the main-mast; I now found myself nearly\r\nabreast of the mizzen-mast, the frigate slowly gliding by like a black\r\nworld in the water. Her vast hull loomed out of the night, showing\r\nhundreds of seamen in the hammock-nettings, some tossing over ropes,\r\nothers madly flinging overboard the hammocks; but I was too far out\r\nfrom them immediately to reach what they threw. I essayed to swim\r\ntoward the ship; but instantly I was conscious of a feeling like being\r\npinioned in a feather-bed, and, moving my hands, felt my jacket puffed\r\nout above my tight girdle with water. I strove to tear it off; but it\r\nwas looped together here and there, and the strings were not then to be\r\nsundered by hand. I whipped out my knife, that was tucked at my belt,\r\nand ripped my jacket straight up and down, as if I were ripping open\r\nmyself. With a violent struggle I then burst out of it, and was free.\r\nHeavily soaked, it slowly sank before my eyes.\r\n\r\nSink! sink! oh shroud! thought I; sink forever! accursed jacket that\r\nthou art!\r\n\r\n“See that white shark!” cried a horrified voice from the taffrail;\r\n“he’ll have that man down his hatchway! Quick! the _grains!_ the\r\n_grains!_”\r\n\r\nThe next instant that barbed bunch of harpoons pierced through and\r\nthrough the unfortunate jacket, and swiftly sped down with it out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nBeing now astern of the frigate, I struck out boldly toward the\r\nelevated pole of one of the life-buoys which had been cut away. Soon\r\nafter, one of the cutters picked me up. As they dragged me out of the\r\nwater into the air, the sudden transition of elements made my every\r\nlimb feel like lead, and I helplessly sunk into the bottom of the boat.\r\n\r\nTen minutes after, I was safe on board, and, springing aloft, was\r\nordered to reeve anew the stun’-sail-halyards, which, slipping through\r\nthe blocks when I had let go the end, had unrove and fallen to the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nThe sail was soon set; and, as if purposely to salute it, a gentle\r\nbreeze soon came, and the Neversink once more glided over the water, a\r\nsoft ripple at her bows, and leaving a tranquil wake behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XCIII.\r\nCABLE AND ANCHOR ALL CLEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now that the white jacket has sunk to the bottom of the sea, and\r\nthe blessed Capes of Virginia are believed to be broad on our\r\nbow—though still out of sight—our five hundred souls are fondly\r\ndreaming of home, and the iron throats of the guns round the galley\r\nre-echo with their songs and hurras—what more remains?\r\n\r\nShall I tell what conflicting and almost crazy surmisings prevailed\r\nconcerning the precise harbour for which we were bound? For, according\r\nto rumour, our Commodore had received sealed orders touching that\r\nmatter, which were not to be broken open till we gained a precise\r\nlatitude of the coast. Shall I tell how, at last, all this uncertainty\r\ndeparted, and many a foolish prophecy was proved false, when our noble\r\nfrigate—her longest pennant at her main—wound her stately way into the\r\ninnermost harbour of Norfolk, like a plumed Spanish Grandee threading\r\nthe corridors of the Escurial toward the throne-room within? Shall I\r\ntell how we kneeled upon the holy soil? How I begged a blessing of old\r\nUshant, and one precious hair of his beard for a keepsake? How\r\nLemsford, the gun-deck bard, offered up a devout ode as a prayer of\r\nthanksgiving? How saturnine Nord, the magnifico in disguise, refusing\r\nall companionship, stalked off into the woods, like the ghost of an old\r\nCalif of Bagdad? How I swayed and swung the hearty hand of Jack Chase,\r\nand nipped it to mine with a Carrick bend; yea, and kissed that noble\r\nhand of my liege lord and captain of my top, my sea-tutor and sire?\r\n\r\nShall I tell how the grand Commodore and Captain drove off from the\r\npier-head? How the Lieutenants, in undress, sat down to their last\r\ndinner in the ward-room, and the champagne, packed in ice, spirted and\r\nsparkled like the Hot Springs out of a snow-drift in Iceland? How the\r\nChaplain went off in his cassock, without bidding the people adieu? How\r\nshrunken Cuticle, the Surgeon, stalked over the side, the wired\r\nskeleton carried in his wake by his cot-boy? How the Lieutenant of\r\nMarines sheathed his sword on the poop, and, calling for wax and a\r\ntaper, sealed the end of the scabbard with his family crest and\r\nmotto—_Denique Coelum?_ How the Purser in due time mustered his\r\nmoney-bags, and paid us all off on the quarter-deck—good and bad, sick\r\nand well, all receiving their wages; though, truth to tell, some\r\nreckless, improvident seamen, who had lived too fast during the cruise,\r\nhad little or nothing now standing on the credit side of their Purser’s\r\naccounts?\r\n\r\nShall I tell of the Retreat of the Five Hundred inland; not, alas! in\r\nbattle-array, as at quarters, but scattered broadcast over the land?\r\n\r\nShall I tell how the Neversink was at last stripped of spars, shrouds,\r\nand sails—had her guns hoisted out—her powder-magazine, shot-lockers,\r\nand armouries discharged—till not one vestige of a fighting thing was\r\nleft in her, from furthest stem to uttermost stern?\r\n\r\nNo! let all this go by; for our anchor still hangs from our bows,\r\nthough its eager flukes dip their points in the impatient waves. Let us\r\nleave the ship on the sea—still with the land out of sight—still with\r\nbrooding darkness on the face of the deep. I love an indefinite,\r\ninfinite background—a vast, heaving, rolling, mysterious rear!\r\n\r\nIt is night. The meagre moon is in her last quarter—that betokens the\r\nend of a cruise that is passing. But the stars look forth in their\r\neverlasting brightness—and _that_ is the everlasting, glorious Future,\r\nfor ever beyond us.\r\n\r\nWe main-top-men are all aloft in the top; and round our mast we circle,\r\na brother-band, hand in hand, all spliced together. We have reefed the\r\nlast top-sail; trained the last gun; blown the last match; bowed to the\r\nlast blast; been tranced in the last calm. We have mustered our last\r\nround the capstan; been rolled to grog the last time; for the last time\r\nswung in our hammocks; for the last time turned out at the sea-gull\r\ncall of the watch. We have seen our last man scourged at the gangway;\r\nour last man gasp out the ghost in the stifling Sick-bay; our last man\r\ntossed to the sharks. Our last death-denouncing Article of War has been\r\nread; and far inland, in that blessed clime whither-ward our frigate\r\nnow glides, the last wrong in our frigate will be remembered no more;\r\nwhen down from our main-mast comes our Commodore’s pennant, when down\r\nsinks its shooting stars from the sky.\r\n\r\n“By the mark, nine!” sings the hoary old leadsman, in the chains. And\r\nthus, the mid-world Equator passed, our frigate strikes soundings at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nHand in hand we top-mates stand, rocked in our Pisgah top. And over the\r\nstarry waves, and broad out into the blandly blue and boundless night,\r\nspiced with strange sweets from the long-sought land—the whole long\r\ncruise predestinated ours, though often in tempest-time we almost\r\nrefused to believe in that far-distant shore—straight out into that\r\nfragrant night, ever-noble Jack Chase, matchless and unmatchable Jack\r\nChase stretches forth his bannered hand, and, pointing shoreward,\r\ncries: “For the last time, hear Camoens, boys!”\r\n\r\n     “How calm the waves, how mild the balmy gale!\r\n      The Halcyons call, ye Lusians spread the sail!\r\n      Appeased, old Ocean now shall rage no more;\r\n      Haste, point our bowsprit for yon shadowy shore.\r\n      Soon shall the transports of your natal soil\r\n      O’erwhelm in bounding joy the thoughts of every toil.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a man-of-war that sails through the sea, so this earth that sails\r\nthrough the air. We mortals are all on board a fast-sailing,\r\nnever-sinking world-frigate, of which God was the shipwright; and she\r\nis but one craft in a Milky-Way fleet, of which God is the Lord High\r\nAdmiral. The port we sail from is for ever astern. And though far out\r\nof sight of land, for ages and ages we continue to sail with sealed\r\norders, and our last destination remains a secret to ourselves and our\r\nofficers; yet our final haven was predestinated ere we slipped from the\r\nstocks at Creation.\r\n\r\nThus sailing with sealed orders, we ourselves are the repositories of\r\nthe secret packet, whose mysterious contents we long to learn. There\r\nare no mysteries out of ourselves. But let us not give ear to the\r\nsuperstitious, gun-deck gossip about whither we may be gliding, for, as\r\nyet, not a soul on board of us knows—not even the Commodore himself;\r\nassuredly not the Chaplain; even our Professor’s scientific surmisings\r\nare vain. On that point, the smallest cabin-boy is as wise as the\r\nCaptain. And believe not the hypochondriac dwellers below hatches, who\r\nwill tell you, with a sneer, that our world-frigate is bound to no\r\nfinal harbour whatever; that our voyage will prove an endless\r\ncircumnavigation of space. Not so. For how can this world-frigate prove\r\nour eventual abiding place, when upon our first embarkation, as infants\r\nin arms, her violent rolling—in after life unperceived—makes every soul\r\nof us sea-sick? Does not this show, too, that the very air we here\r\ninhale is uncongenial, and only becomes endurable at last through\r\ngradual habituation, and that some blessed, placid haven, however\r\nremote at present, must be in store for us all?\r\n\r\nGlance fore and aft our flush decks. What a swarming crew! All told,\r\nthey muster hard upon eight hundred millions of souls. Over these we\r\nhave authoritative Lieutenants, a sword-belted Officer of Marines, a\r\nChaplain, a Professor, a Purser, a Doctor, a Cook, a Master-at-arms.\r\n\r\nOppressed by illiberal laws, and partly oppressed by themselves, many\r\nof our people are wicked, unhappy, inefficient. We have skulkers and\r\nidlers all round, and brow-beaten waisters, who, for a pittance, do our\r\ncraft’s shabby work. Nevertheless, among our people we have gallant\r\nfore, main, and mizzen top-men aloft, who, well treated or ill, still\r\ntrim our craft to the blast.\r\n\r\nWe have a _brig_ for trespassers; a bar by our main-mast, at which they\r\nare arraigned; a cat-o’-nine-tails and a gangway, to degrade them in\r\ntheir own eyes and in ours. These are not always employed to convert\r\nSin to Virtue, but to divide them, and protect Virtue and legalised Sin\r\nfrom unlegalised Vice.\r\n\r\nWe have a Sick-bay for the smitten and helpless, whither we hurry them\r\nout of sight, and however they may groan beneath hatches, we hear\r\nlittle of their tribulations on deck; we still sport our gay streamer\r\naloft. Outwardly regarded, our craft is a lie; for all that is\r\noutwardly seen of it is the clean-swept deck, and oft-painted planks\r\ncomprised above the waterline; whereas, the vast mass of our fabric,\r\nwith all its storerooms of secrets, for ever slides along far under the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nWhen a shipmate dies, straightway we sew him up, and overboard he goes;\r\nour world-frigate rushes by, and never more do we behold him again;\r\nthough, sooner or later, the everlasting under-tow sweeps him toward\r\nour own destination.\r\n\r\nWe have both a quarter-deck to our craft and a gun-deck; subterranean\r\nshot-lockers and gunpowder magazines; and the Articles of War form our\r\ndomineering code.\r\n\r\nOh, shipmates and world-mates, all round! we the people suffer many\r\nabuses. Our gun-deck is full of complaints. In vain from Lieutenants do\r\nwe appeal to the Captain; in vain—while on board our world-frigate—to\r\nthe indefinite Navy Commissioners, so far out of sight aloft. Yet the\r\nworst of our evils we blindly inflict upon ourselves; our officers\r\ncannot remove them, even if they would. From the last ills no being can\r\nsave another; therein each man must be his own saviour. For the rest,\r\nwhatever befall us, let us never train our murderous guns inboard; let\r\nus not mutiny with bloody pikes in our hands. Our Lord High Admiral\r\nwill yet interpose; and though long ages should elapse, and leave our\r\nwrongs unredressed, yet, shipmates and world-mates! let us never\r\nforget, that,\r\n\r\n     Whoever afflict us, whatever surround,\r\n     Life is a voyage that’s homeward-bound!\r\n\r\nTHE END",
