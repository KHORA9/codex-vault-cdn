LEMOINE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CITIZENS OF QUEBEC\r\n\r\nTHIS VOLUME IS\r\n\r\nRespectfully Inscribed\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume, purporting to be a sequel to \"QUEBEC PAST AND PRESENT,\"\r\npublished in 1876, is intended to complete the history of the city. New\r\nand interesting details will be found in these pages, about the locality,\r\nwhere Samuel de Champlain located his settlement in 1608, together with a\r\nrapid glance at incidents, sights, objects, edifices, city gates and other\r\nimprovements, both ancient and modern, which an antiquarian's ramble round\r\nthe streets, squares, promenades, monuments, public and private edifices,\r\n&c., may disclose. It will, it is hoped, be found a copious repository of\r\nhistorical, topographical, legendary, industrial and antiquarian lore--\r\ngarnered not without some trouble from authorities difficult of access to\r\nthe general reader. May it prove not merely a faithful mirror of the past,\r\nbut also an authentic record of the present!\r\n\r\nTHE SKETCH OF THE ENVIRONS OF QUEBEC will take the tourist or student of\r\nhistory beyond the ramparts of Old Stadacona, to the memorable area--the\r\nPlains of Abraham--where, one century back and more, took place the hard-\r\nfought duel which caused the collapse of French power in the New World,\r\nestablished British rule on our shores, and hastened the birth of the\r\ngreat Commonwealth founded by George Washington, by removing from the\r\nBritish Provinces, south of us, the counterpoise of French dominion. More\r\nthan once French Canada had threatened the New England Settlements; more\r\nthan once it had acted like a barrier to the expansion and consolidation\r\nof the conquering Anglo-Saxon race.\r\n\r\nTHE ENVIRONS OF QUEBEC are, indeed, classic soil, trodden by the footsteps\r\nof many of the most remarkable men in American History: Cartier,\r\nChamplain, Phipps, d'Iberville, Laval, Frontenac, La Galissonnère, Wolfe,\r\nMontcalm, Levis, Amherst, Murray, Guy Carleton, Nelson, Cook,\r\nBougainville, Jervis, Montgomery, Arnold, DeSalaberry, Brock and others.\r\nHere, in early times, on the shore of the majestic St. Lawrence, stood the\r\nwigwam and canoe of the marauding savage; here, was heard the clang of\r\nFrench sabre and Scotch claymore in deadly encounter--the din of battle\r\non the tented field; here,--but no further--had surged the wave of\r\nAmerican invasion; here, have bivouaced on more than one gory battle-\r\nfield, the gay warrior from the banks of the Seine, the staunch musketeers\r\nof Old England, the unerring riflemen of New York, Massachusetts and Rhode\r\nIsland. Another spot calculated to interest us is the vast expanse from\r\nthe Plains to Cap Rouge, round by Ste. Foye to the city, for which I\r\nintend to use its former more general name, Sillery: the ground is not new\r\nfor us, as its annals and country seats furnished, in 1865, materials for\r\nsketches, published that year under the title of _Maple Leaves_. These\r\nsketches having long since disappeared from book-stores, at the request of\r\nseveral enlightened patrons, I re-publish from them some selections, with\r\nanecdotes and annotations. Several other sites round Quebec--Beauport,\r\nCharlesbourg, the Falls of Montmorency and of the Chaudière, Château\r\nBigot, Lorette and its Hurons--will, of necessity, find a resting place in\r\nthis repertory of Quebec history, which closes a labour of love, the\r\nseries of works on Canada, commenced by me in 1861.\r\n\r\nIn order to enhance the usefulness of this work, extensive and varied\r\nhistorical matter has been included in the appendix for reference.\r\n\r\nTo my many friends, whose notes and advice have been so freely placed at\r\nmy disposal, I return my grateful thanks.\r\n\r\nJ.

The wintering of the\r\nventuresome Jacques Cartier on the banks of the St. Charles in 1535-6, by\r\nits remoteness, is an incident of interest, not only to Canadians, but\r\nalso to every denizen of America. It takes one back to an era nearly\r\ncoeval with the discovery of the continent by Columbus--much anterior to\r\nthe foundation of Jamestown, in 1607--anterior to that of St Augustine, in\r\nFlorida. Quebec, has, then, a right to call herself an old, a very old,\r\ncity of the west.\r\n\r\nThe colonization of Canada, or, as it was formerly called, New France, was\r\nundertaken by French merchants engaged in the fur trade, close on whose\r\nsteps followed a host of devoted missionaries who found, in the forests of\r\nthis new and attractive country, ample scope for the exercise of their\r\nreligious enthusiasm. It was at Quebec that these Christian heroes landed,\r\nfrom hence they started for the forest primeval, the bearers of the olive\r\nbranch of Christianity, an unfailing token of civilization.\r\n\r\nA fatal mistake committed at the outset by the French commanders, in\r\ntaking sides in the Indian wars, more than once brought the incipient\r\ncolony to the verge of ruin. During these periods, scores of devoted\r\nmissionaries fell under the scalping knife or suffered incredible tortures\r\namongst the merciless savages whom they had come to reclaim. Indian\r\nmassacres became so frequent, so appalling, that on several occasions the\r\nFrench thought seriously of giving up the colony forever. The rivalry\r\nbetween France and England, added to the hardships and dangers of the few\r\nhardy colonists established at Quebec. Its environs, the shores of its\r\nnoble river, more than once became the battle-field of European armies.\r\nThese are periods of strife, happily gone by, we hope, forever.\r\n\r\nIn his \"_Pioneers of France in the New World_,\" the gifted Francis\r\nParkman mournfully reviews the vanished glories of old France in her\r\nformer vast dominions in America:--\r\n\r\n    \"The French dominion is a memory of the past; and when we evoke its\r\n    departed shades, they rise upon us from their graves in strange\r\n    romantic guise. Again their ghostly camp-fires seem to burn, and the\r\n    fitful light is cast around on lord and vassal and black robed priest,\r\n    mingled with wild forms of savage warriors, knit in close fellowship\r\n    on the same stern errand. A boundless vision grows upon us: an untamed\r\n    continent, vast wastes of forest verdure, mountains silent in primeval\r\n    sleep; river, lake, and glimmering pool; wilderness oceans mingling\r\n    with the sky. Such was the domain which France conquered for\r\n    civilization. Plumed helmets gleamed in the shade of its forests;\r\n    priestly vestments in its dens and fastnesses of ancient barbarism.\r\n    Men steeped in antique learning, pale with the close breath of the\r\n    cloister, here spent the noon and evening of their lives, ruled savage\r\n    hordes with a mild, parental sway, and stood serene before the direst\r\n    shapes of death. Men of a courtly nurture, heirs to the polish of a\r\n    far-reaching ancestry, here, with their dauntless hardihood, put to\r\n    shame the boldest sons of toil.\"\r\n\r\nOf all this mighty empire of the past, Quebec was the undisputed capital,\r\nthe fortress, the keystone.\r\n\r\nIt would be a curious study to place in juxtaposition the impressions\r\nproduced on Tourists by the view of Quebec and its environs--from the era\r\nof Jacques Cartier, the discoverer of Canada, down to that of the Earl of\r\nDufferin, one of its truest friends.\r\n\r\nChamplain, La Potherie, La Houtan, Le Beau, Du Creux (Creuxius), Peter\r\nKalm, Knox, Silliman, Ampère, Mrs. Moodie, Dickens, Lever, Anthony\r\nTrollope, Sala, Thoreau, Warburton, Marmier, Capt. Butler, Sir Charles\r\nDilke, Henry Ward Beecher, have all left their impressions of the rocky\r\ncitadel: let us gaze on a few of their vivid pictures.\r\n\r\n    \"The scenic beauty of Quebec has been the theme of general eulogy. The\r\n    majestic appearance of Cape Diamond and the fortifications, the\r\n    cupolas and minarets, like those of an eastern city, blazing and\r\n    sparkling in the sun, the loveliness of the panorama, the noble basin,\r\n    like a sheet of purest silver, in which might ride with safety a\r\n    hundred sail of the line, the graceful meandering of the river St.\r\n    Charles, the numerous village spires on either side of the St.\r\n    Lawrence, the fertile fields dotted with innumerable cottages, the\r\n    abode of a rich and moral peasantry,--the distant falls of\r\n    Montmorency,--the park like scenery of Point Levis,--the beauteous\r\n    Isle of Orleans,--and more distant still, the frowning Cape Tourmente,\r\n    and the lofty range of purple mountains of the most picturesque form,\r\n    which, without exaggeration, is scarcely to be surpassed in any part\r\n    of the world.\" (Hawkins' _Picture of Quebec_.)\r\n\r\n    \"Quebec recalls Angoulême to my mind: in the upper city, stairways,\r\n    narrow streets, ancient houses on the verge of the cliff; in the lower\r\n    city, the new fortunes, commerce, workmen;--in both, many shops and\r\n    much activity.\" (M. Sand.)\r\n\r\n    \"Take mountain and plain, sinuous river, and broad, tranquil waters,\r\n    stately ship and tiny boat, gentle hill and shady valley, bold\r\n    headland and rich, fruitful fields, frowning battlement and cheerful\r\n    villa, glittering dome and rural spire, flowery garden and sombre\r\n    forest,--group them all into the choicest picture of ideal beauty your\r\n    fancy can create; arch it over with a cloudless sky, light it up with\r\n    a radiant sun, and lest the sheen should be too dazzling, hang a veil\r\n    of lighted haze over all, to soften the lines and perfect the repose,\r\n    --you will then have seen Quebec on this September morning.\" (Eliot\r\n    Warburton.)\r\n\r\n    \"I rubbed my eyes to be sure I was in the nineteenth century, and not\r\n    entering one of those portals which sometimes adorn the frontispiece\r\n    of old black-letter volumes. I though it would be a good place to read\r\n    Froissart's Chronicles. It was such a reminiscence of the Middle Ages\r\n    as Scott's Novels.\r\n\r\n    \"Too much has not been said about the scenery of Quebec. The\r\n    fortifications of Cape Diamond are omnipresent. You travel ten,\r\n    twenty, thirty miles up or down the river's banks, you ramble fifteen\r\n    miles among the hills on either side, and then, when you have long\r\n    since forgotten them, perchance slept on them by the way, at a turn of\r\n    the road or of your body, there they are still with their geometry\r\n    against the sky....\r\n\r\n    \"No wonder if Jacques Cartier's pilot exclaimed in Norman-French\r\n    _Que bec!_ (\"What a peak!\") when he saw this cape, as some suppose.\r\n    Every modern traveller uses a similar expression....\r\n\r\n    \"The view from Cape Diamond has been compared by European travellers\r\n    with the most remarkable views of a similar kind in Europe, such as\r\n    those from Edinburgh Castle, Gibraltar, Cintra, and others, and\r\n    preferred by many. A main peculiarity in this, compared with other\r\n    views which I have beheld, is that it is from the ramparts of a\r\n    fortified city, and not from a solitary and majestic river cape alone\r\n    that this view is obtained.... I still remember the harbour far\r\n    beneath me, sparkling like silver in the sun,--the answering headlands\r\n    of Point Levis on the south-east,--the frowning Cape Tourmente\r\n    abruptly bounding the seaward view in the north-east,--the villages of\r\n    Lorette and Charlesbourg on the north,--and farther west, the distant\r\n    Val Cartier, sparkling with white cottages, hardly removed by distance\r\n    through the clear air,--not to mention a few blue mountains along the\r\n    horizon in that direction. You look out from the ramparts of the\r\n    citadel beyond the frontiers of civilization. Yonder small group of\r\n    hills, according to the guide-book, forms the portals of the wilds\r\n    which are trodden only by the feet of the Indian hunters as far as\r\n    Hudson's Bay.\" (Thoreau).\r\n\r\nMrs. Moodie (Susannah Strickland), in her sketches of Canadian life,\r\ngraphically delineates her trip from Grosse Isle to Quebec, and the\r\nappearance of the city itself from the river:--\r\n\r\n    \"On the 22nd of September (1832), the anchor was weighed, and we bade\r\n    a long farewell to Grosse Isle. As our vessel struck into mid-channel,\r\n    I cast a last lingering look at the beautiful shore we were leaving.\r\n    Cradled in the arms of the St. Lawrence, and basking in the bright\r\n    rays of the morning sun, the island and its sister group looked like a\r\n    second Eden just emerged from the waters of chaos. The day was warm,\r\n    and the cloudless heavens of that peculiar azure tint which gives to\r\n    the Canadian skies and waters a brilliancy unknown in more northern\r\n    latitudes. The air was pure and elastic; the sun shone out with\r\n    uncommon splendour, lighting up the changing woods with a rich mellow\r\n    colouring, composed of a thousand brilliant and vivid dyes. The mighty\r\n    river rolled flashing and sparkling onward, impelled by a strong\r\n    breeze that tipped its short rolling surges with a crest of snowy\r\n    foam.\r\n\r\n    \"Never shall I forget that short voyage from Grosse Isle to Quebec.\r\n    What wonderful combinations of beauty and grandeur and power, at every\r\n    winding of that noble river!\r\n\r\n    \"Every perception of my mind became absorbed into the one sense of\r\n    seeing, when, upon rounding Point Levis, we cast anchor before Quebec.\r\n    What a scene! Can the world produce another? Edinburgh had been the\r\n    _beau ideal_ to me of all that was beautiful in nature--a vision\r\n    of the Northern Highlands had haunted my dreams across the Atlantic;\r\n    but all these past recollections faded before the _present_ of\r\n    Quebec. Nature has ransacked all our grandest elements to form this\r\n    astonishing panorama. There, frowns the cloud-capped mountain, and\r\n    below, the cataract foams and thunders; woods and rock and river\r\n    combine to lend their aid in making the picture perfect, and worthy of\r\n    its Divine originator. The precipitous bank upon which the city lies\r\n    piled, reflected in the still, deep waters at its base, greatly\r\n    enhances the romantic beauty of the situation. The mellow and serene\r\n    glow of the autumn day harmonized so perfectly with the solemn\r\n    grandeur of the scene around me, and sank so silently and deeply into\r\n    my soul, that my spirit fell prostrate before it, and I melted\r\n    involuntarily into tears.\"\r\n\r\nSuch the poetic visions which were awakened in the poetic mind of the\r\nbrilliant author of \"_Roughing it, in the Bush._\" Charles Dickens also had\r\nhis say in this matter, on his visit to Quebec, in May 1842, where he was\r\nthe guest of the President of the _Literary and Historical Society_, Dr.\r\nJohn Charlton Fisher:--\r\n\r\n    \"The impression made upon the visitor by this Gibraltar of America,\r\n    its giddy heights, its citadel suspended, as it were, in the air; its\r\n    picturesque steep streets and frowning gateways; and the splendid\r\n    views which burst upon the eye at every turn, is at once unique and\r\n    lasting. It is a place not to be forgotten or mixed up in the mind\r\n    with other places, or altered for a moment in the crowd of scenes a\r\n    traveller can recall. Apart from the realities of this most\r\n    picturesque city, there are associations clustering about it which\r\n    would make a desert rich in interest. The dangerous precipice along\r\n    whose rocky front Wolfe and his brave companions climbed to glory; the\r\n    Plains of Abraham, where he received his mortal wound; the fortress so\r\n    chivalrously defended by Montcalm; and his soldier's grave, dug for\r\n    him when yet alive, by the bursting of a shell, are not the least\r\n    among them, or among the gallant incidents of history. That is a noble\r\n    monument too, and worthy of two great nations, which perpetuates the\r\n    memory of both brave Generals, and on which their names are jointly\r\n    written.\r\n\r\n    \"The city is rich in public institutions and in Catholic churches and\r\n    charities, but it is mainly in the prospect from the site of the Old\r\n    Government House and from the Citadel, that its surpassing beauty\r\n    lies. The exquisite expanse of country, rich in field and forest,\r\n    mountain-heights and water, which lies stretched out before the view,\r\n    with miles of Canadian villages, glancing in long white streaks, like\r\n    veins along the landscape; the motley crowd of gables, roofs and\r\n    chimney tops in the old hilly town immediately at hand; the beautiful\r\n    St. Lawrence sparkling and flashing in the sunlight; and the tiny\r\n    ships below the rock from which you gaze, whose distant rigging looks\r\n    like spiders' webs against the light, while casks and barrels on their\r\n    decks dwindle into toys, and busy mariners become so many puppets; all\r\n    this framed by a sunken window [1] in the fortress and looked at from\r\n    the shadowed room within, forms one of the brightest and most\r\n    enchanting pictures that the eye can rest upon.\" (Dickens' _American\r\n    Notes_.)\r\n\r\nA distinguished French _littérateur_, fresh from the sunny banks of\r\nthe Seine, thus discourses anent the Ancient capital; we translate:--\r\n\r\n    \"Few cities,\" says M. Marmier, [2] \"offer as many striking contrasts\r\n    as Quebec, a fortress and a commercial city together, built upon the\r\n    summit of a rock as the nest of an eagle, while her vessels are\r\n    everywhere wrinkling the face of the ocean; an American city inhabited\r\n    by French colonists, governed by England, and garrisoned with Scotch\r\n    regiments; [3] a city of the middle ages by most of its ancient\r\n    institutions, while it is submitted to all the combinations of modern\r\n    constitutional government; an European city by its civilization and\r\n    its habits of refinement, and still close by, the remnants of the\r\n    Indian tribes and the barren mountains of the north, a city of about\r\n    the same latitude as Paris, while successively combining the torrid\r\n    climate of southern regions with the severities of an hyperborean\r\n    winter; a city at the same time Catholic and Protestant, where the\r\n    labours of our (French) missions are still uninterrupted alongside of\r\n    the undertakings of the Bible Society, and where the Jesuits driven\r\n    out of our own country (France) find a place of refuge under the aegis\r\n    of British Puritanism!\"\r\n\r\nAn American tourist thus epitomises the sights:--\r\n\r\n    \"As the seat of French power in America until 1759, the great fortress\r\n    of English rule in British America, and the key of the St. Lawrence,\r\n    Quebec must possess interest of no ordinary character for well-\r\n    informed tourists. To the traveller, there are innumerable points and\r\n    items vastly interesting and curious--the citadel and forts of Cape\r\n    Diamond, with their impregnable ramparts that rival Gibraltar in\r\n    strength and endurance against siege, the old walls of the city and\r\n    their gates each of which has its legend of war and bloody assault and\r\n    repulse, the plains of Abraham, every foot of which is commemorated\r\n    with blood and battle; Wolfe's monument, where the gallant and brave\r\n    soldier died with a shout of victory on his lips, the Martello towers,\r\n    with their subterranean communications with the citadel; the antique\r\n    churches, paintings, and all their paraphernalia, treasures, and\r\n    curiosities that are religiously preserved therein, the falls of\r\n    Montmorency, the natural steps. Montcalm's house, and a thousand other\r\n    relics of the mysterious past that has hallowed these with all the\r\n    mystic interest that attaches to antiquity, great deeds, and beautiful\r\n    memories. To see all these, a tourist requires at least two days'\r\n    time, and surely no one who pretends to be a traveller, in these days\r\n    of rapid transit will fail to visit Quebec, the best city, the most\r\n    hospitable place, and richer in its wealth of rare sights and grand\r\n    old memorials. French peculiarities and English oddities, than any\r\n    other city on this broad continent.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Leaving the citadel, we are once more in the European Middle ages.\r\n    Gates and posterns, cranky steps that lead up to lofty, gabled houses,\r\n    with sharp French roofs of burnished tin, like those of Liège;\r\n    processions of the Host; altars decked with flowers; statues of the\r\n    Virgin; sabots, blouses, and the scarlet of the British lines-man,--\r\n    all these are seen in narrow streets and markets that are graced with\r\n    many a Cotentin lace cap, and all within forty miles of the down-east,\r\n    Yankee state of Maine. It is not far from New England to Old\r\n    France.... There has been no dying out of the race among the French\r\n    Canadians. They number twenty times the thousand that they did 100\r\n    years ago. The American soil has left physical type, religion,\r\n    language, and laws absolutely untouched. They herd together in their\r\n    rambling villages, dance to the fiddle after Mass on Sundays,--as\r\n    gayly as once did their Norman sires,--and keep up the _fleur-de-\r\n    lys_ and the memory of Montcalm. More French than the French are the\r\n    Lower Canada _habitans_. The pulse-beat of the continent finds no echo\r\n    here.\"--(Sir Charles Dilke.)\r\n\r\nIn the rosy days of his budding fame, the gifted Henry Ward Beecher\r\ndiscoursed as follows of the Rock City [4]:--\r\n\r\n    \"Curious old Quebec!--of all the cities on the continent of America,\r\n    the quaintest.... It is a populated cliff. It is a mighty rock,\r\n    scarped and graded, and made to hold houses and castles which, by a\r\n    proper natural law, ought to slide off from its back, like an ungirded\r\n    load from a camel's back. But they stick. At the foot of the rocks,\r\n    the space of several streets in width has been stolen from the\r\n    river.... We landed....\r\n\r\n    \"Away we went, climbing the steep streets at a canter with little\r\n    horses hardly bigger than flies, with an aptitude for climbing\r\n    perpendicular walls. It was strange to enter a walled city through low\r\n    and gloomy gates, on this continent of America. Here was a small bit\r\n    of mediaeval Europe perched upon a rock, and dried for keeping, in\r\n    this north-east corner of America, a curiosity that has not its equal,\r\n    in its kind, on this side of the ocean....\r\n\r\n    \"We rode about as if we were in a picture-book, taming over a new leaf\r\n    at each street!... The place should always be kept old. Let people go\r\n    somewhere else for modern improvements. It is a shame, when Quebec\r\n    placed herself far out of the way, up in the very neighbourhood of\r\n    Hudson's Bay, that it should be hunted and harassed with new-fangled\r\n    notions, and that all the charming inconveniences and irregularities\r\n    of narrow and tortuous streets, that so delight a traveller's eyes,\r\n    should be altered to suit the fantastic notions of modern people....\r\n\r\n    \"Our stay in Quebec was too short by far. But it was long enough to\r\n    make it certain that we shall come back again. A summer in Canada\r\n    would form one of the most delightful holidays that we can imagine. We\r\n    mean to prove our sincerity by our conduct. And then, if it is not all\r\n    that our imagination promises, we will write again and confess.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Benjamin Silliman discourses thus:--\r\n\r\n    \"A seat of ancient dominion--now hoary with the lapse of more than two\r\n    centuries--formerly the seat of a French empire in the west--lost and\r\n    won by the blood of gallant armies, and of illustrious commanders--\r\n    throned on a rock, and defended by all the proud defiance of war! Who\r\n    could approach such a city without emotion? Who in Canada has not\r\n    longed to cast his eyes on the water-girt rocks and towers of\r\n    Quebec.\"--(Silliman's _Tour in Canada_, 1819.)\r\n\r\nCharles Lever has left a curious glimpse of Quebec from Diamond Harbour,\r\nas seen, by his incomparable Irish Gil Blas, Mr. Cornelius Cregan, the\r\nappreciated lodger of Madam Thomas John Davis at the \"Hotel Davis.\"\r\n\r\n    \"As viewed from Diamond Harbour, a more striking city than Quebec is\r\n    seldom seen. The great rock rising above the Lower Town, and crowned\r\n    with its batteries, all bristling with guns, seemed to my eyes the\r\n    very realization of impregnability. I looked upon the ship that lay\r\n    tranquilly on the water below, and whose decks were thronged with\r\n    blue-jackets--to the Highlander who paced his short path as sentry,\r\n    some hundred feet high upon the wall of the fortress, and I thought to\r\n    myself with such defenders as these that standard yonder need never\r\n    carry any other banner. The whole view is panoramic, the bending of\r\n    the river shuts out the channel by which you have made your approach,\r\n    giving the semblance of a lake, on whose surface vessels of every\r\n    nation lie at anchor, some with the sails hung out to dry, gracefully\r\n    drooping from the taper spars; others refitting again for sea, and\r\n    loading the huge pine-trunks moored as vast rafts to the stern. There\r\n    were people everywhere, all was motion, life and activity. Jolly-boats\r\n    with twenty oars, man-of-war gigs bounding rapidly past them with\r\n    eight; canoes skimming by without a ripple, and seemingly without\r\n    impulse, till you caught sight of the lounging figure, who lay at full\r\n    length in the stern, and whose red features were scarce\r\n    distinguishable from the copper-coloured bark of his boat. Some moved\r\n    upon the rafts, and even upon single trunks of trees, as, separated\r\n    from the mass, they floated down on the swift current, boat-hook in\r\n    hand to catch at the first object chance might offer them. The quays\r\n    and the streets leading down to them were all thronged, and as you\r\n    cast your eye upwards, here and there above the tall roofs might be\r\n    seen the winding of stairs that lead to the Upper Town, alike dark\r\n    with the moving tide of men. On every embrasure and gallery, on every\r\n    terrace and platform, it was the same. Never did I behold such a human\r\n    tide.\r\n\r\n    \"Now there was something amazingly inspiriting in all this,\r\n    particularly when coming from the solitude and monotony of a long\r\n    voyage. [5] The very voice that ye-hoéd; the hoarse challenge of the\r\n    sentinels on the rock; the busy hum of the town--made delicious music\r\n    to my ear; and I could have stood and leaned over the bulwark for\r\n    hours, to gaze at the scene. I own no higher interest invested the\r\n    picture--for I was ignorant of Wolfe. I had never heard of Montcalm--\r\n    the plains of \"Abraham\" were to me but grassy slopes, and \"nothing\r\n    more.\" It was the life and stir,--the tide of that human ocean, on\r\n    which I longed myself to be a swimmer--these were what charmed me. Nor\r\n    was the deck of the old \"Hampden\" inactive all the while, although\r\n    seldom attracting much of my notice: soldiers were mustering,\r\n    knapsacks packing, rolls calling, belts buffing, and coats brushing on\r\n    all sides; men grumbling, sergeants cursing; officers swearing; half-\r\n    dressed invalids popping up their heads out of hatchways, answering to\r\n    wrong names, and doctors ordering them down again with many an\r\n    anathema: soldiers in the way of sailors, and sailors always hauling\r\n    at something that interfered with the inspection-drill: every one in\r\n    the wrong place, and each cursing his neighbour for stupidity. At last\r\n    the shore-boats boarded us, as if our confusion wanted anything to\r\n    increase it. Red-faced harbour-masters shook hands with the skipper\r\n    and pilot, and disappeared into the \"round-house\" to discuss grog and\r\n    the gales. Officers from the garrison came out to welcome their\r\n    friends--for it was the second battalion we had on board of a regiment\r\n    whose first had been some years in Canada;--and then what a rush of\r\n    inquiries were exchanged. \"How is the Duke?\"--\"All quiet in England\"--\r\n    \"No sign of war in Europe!\"--\"Are the 8th come home!\"--\"Where is\r\n    Forbes?\"--\"Has Davern sold out?\" with a mass of such small interests\r\n    as engage men who live in coteries.\" (Confessions of Con. Cregan, Chap\r\n    XIII.)\r\n\r\nThere are yet among the living in Quebec many who can recall the good\r\nolden times when our garrison contained two regiments and more of the red-\r\ncoated soldiers of England, at the beck of the \"Iron Duke\"--_him_ of\r\nWaterloo.\r\n\r\nA Haligonian tourist thus writes:--\r\n\r\n    \"HALIFAX, N. S., 1880.--I reached Halifax on the Saturday after\r\n    leaving Quebec.....Nothing was wanting to make my impressions of\r\n    Quebec perfect, but a little more time to widen, deepen and strengthen\r\n    the friendships made; alas! to be severed (for a time) so soon. I went\r\n    expecting to see a city perched on a rock and inhabited by the\r\n    descendants of a conquered race with a chasm between them and every\r\n    Englishman in the Dominion. In place of this, I found the city more\r\n    picturesque, more odd, more grand, than I had ever imagined, and\r\n    peopled by a race who, if conquered in 1759, have had sweet revenge\r\n    ever since, by making a conquest of every stranger who has entered\r\n    Quebec--through his higher nature. It is no wonder that Quebec has\r\n    such a story of song and adventure. There is romance in the river and\r\n    tragedy on the hill, and while the memory of Wolfe and Montcalm is\r\n    green, the city will be the Mecca of the Dominion. But keep the hand\r\n    of the Goth--the practical man--from touching the old historic\r\n    landmarks of the city. A curse has been pronounced on those who remove\r\n    their neighbours' landmark, but what shall be said of those who remove\r\n    the landmarks which separate century from century and period from\r\n    period.\" (J. T. Bulmer.)\r\n\r\nThe following affords a good specimen of Capt W. F Butler's pictorial\r\nstyle:--\r\n\r\n    \"Spring breaks late over the province of Quebec--that portion of\r\n    America known to our fathers as Lower Canada, and of old to the\r\n    subjects of the Grand Monarque as the kingdom of New France. But when\r\n    the young trees begin to open their leafy lids after the long sleep of\r\n    winter, they do it quickly. The snow is not all gone before the maple\r\n    trees are all green--the maple, that most beautiful of trees! Well has\r\n    Canada made the symbol of her new nationality that tree whose green\r\n    gives the spring its earliest freshness, whose autumn-dying tints are\r\n    richer than the clouds of sunset, whose life-stream is sweeter than\r\n    honey, and whose branches are drowsy through the long summer with the\r\n    scent and the hum of bee and flower! Still the long line of the\r\n    Canadas admits of a varied spring. When the trees are green at Lake\r\n    St. Clair, they are scarcely budding at Kingston, they are leafless at\r\n    Montreal, and Quebec is white with snow. Even between Montreal and\r\n    Quebec, a short night's steaming, there exists a difference of ten\r\n    days in the opening of the summer. But late as comes the summer to\r\n    Quebec, it comes in its loveliest and most enticing form, as though it\r\n    wished to atone for its long delay in banishing from such a landscape\r\n    the cold tyranny of winter. And with what loveliness does the whole\r\n    face of plain, river, lake and mountain turn from the iron clasp of\r\n    icy winter to kiss the balmy lips of returning summer, and to welcome\r\n    his bridal gifts of sun and shower! The trees open their leafy lids to\r\n    look at him--the brooks and streamlets break forth into songs of\r\n    gladness--\"the birch tree,\" as the old Saxon said,\" becomes beautiful\r\n    in its branches, and rustles sweetly in its leafy summit, moved to and\r\n    fro by the breath of heaven\"--the lakes uncover their sweet faces, and\r\n    their mimic shores steal down in quiet evenings to bathe themselves in\r\n    the transparent waters--far into the depths of the great forest speeds\r\n    the glad message of returning glory, and graceful fern, and soft\r\n    velvet moss, and white wax-like lily peep forth to cover rock and\r\n    fallen tree and wreck of last year's autumn in one great sea of\r\n    foliage. There are many landscapes which can never be painted,\r\n    photographed, or described, but which the mind carries away\r\n    instinctively to look at again and again in the after-time--these are\r\n    the celebrated views of the world, and they are not easy to find. From\r\n    the Queen's rampart, on the citadel of Quebec, the eye sweeps over a\r\n    greater diversity of landscape than is probably to be found in any one\r\n    spot in the universe. Blue mountain, far-stretching river, foaming\r\n    cascade, the white sails of ocean ships, the black trunks of many-\r\n    sized guns, the pointed roofs, the white village nestling amidst its\r\n    fields of green, the great isle in mid-channel, the many shades of\r\n    colour from deep blue pine-wood to yellowing corn-field--in what other\r\n    spot on the earth's broad bosom lie grouped together in a single\r\n    glance so many of these \"things of beauty\" which the eye loves to\r\n    feast on and to place in memory as joys for ever?\" (_The Great Lone\r\n    Land._)\r\n\r\nLet us complete this mosaic of descriptions and literary gems, borrowed\r\nfrom English, French and American writers, by a sparkling _tableau_ of the\r\nhistoric memories of Quebec, traced by a French Canadian _littérateur_,\r\nthe Honourable P. J. O. Chauveau:--\r\n\r\n    \"History is everywhere--around us, beneath us; from the depths of\r\n    yonder valleys, from the top of that mountain, history rises up and\r\n    presents itself to our notice, exclaiming: 'Behold me!'\r\n\r\n    \"Beneath us, among the capricious meanders of the River St. Charles,\r\n    the Cahir-Coubat of Jacques Cartier, is the very place where he first\r\n    planted the cross and held his first conference with the _Seigneur\r\n    Donnacona_. Here, very near to us, beneath a venerable elm tree,\r\n    which, with much regret, we saw cut down, tradition states that\r\n    Champlain first raised his tent. From the very spot on which we now\r\n    stand, Count de Frontenac returned to Admiral Phipps that proud\r\n    answer, as he said, _from the mouth of his cannon_, which will\r\n    always remain recorded by history. Under these ramparts are spread the\r\n    plains on which fell Wolfe and where, in the following year, the\r\n    Chevalier de Lévis and General Murray fought that other battle, in\r\n    memory of which the citizens of Quebec are erecting (in 1854) a\r\n    monument. Before us, on the heights of Beauport, the souvenir of\r\n    battles not less heroic, recall to our remembrance the names of\r\n    Longueuil, St. Hélène, and Juchereau Duchesnay. Below us, at the foot\r\n    of that tower on which floats the British flag, Montgomery and his\r\n    soldiers all fell, swept by the grape-shot of a single gun pointed by\r\n    a Canadian artilleryman.\r\n\r\n    \"On the other hand, under that projecting rock, now crowned with the\r\n    guns of old England, the intrepid Dambourgès, sword in hand, drove\r\n    Arnold and his men from the houses in which they had established\r\n    themselves. History is then everywhere around us. She rises as well\r\n    from these ramparts, replete with daring deeds, as from those\r\n    illustrious plains equally celebrated for feats of arms, and she again\r\n    exclaims: 'Here I am!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_QUEBEC FOUNDED, JULY 3,_ 1608.\r\n\r\n\r\nFancy borne on the outspread wings of memory occasionally loves to soar\r\no'er the dull, prosaic present, far away into the haunted, dream-land of a\r\nhazy but hopeful past.\r\n\r\nLet us recall one year, in the revolving cycle of time--one day above all\r\ndays--for dwellers in Champlain's eyry keep pre-eminently sacred that\r\nauspicious 3rd of July, 1608, when his trusty little band, in all twenty-\r\neight, founded the city destined soon to be the great Louis's proud forta-\r\nlice,--the Queen city of the French western world.\r\n\r\nOn that memorable July day, would you, kind reader, like to ascend the\r\nlofty slope of Cape Diamond, at the hour when the orb of light is shedding\r\nhis fierce, meridian rays on the verdant shores and glancing waters below,\r\nand watch with bated breath the gradually increasing gap in the primeval\r\nforest, which busy French axes are cleaving in order to locate the\r\nresidence--\"L'ABITATION\"--of a loved commander, Samuel de Champlain?\r\n\r\nOr else would you, in your partiality for the cool of the evening, prefer\r\nfrom the dizzy summit, where now stands our citadel, to gaze--which would\r\nbe more romantic--over the silent strand at your feet, pregnant with a\r\nmighty future, at the mystic hour of eve, when the pale beams of Diana\r\nwill lend incomparable witchery to this novel scene. Few indeed the\r\nobjects denoting the unwelcome arrival of Europeans in this forest home of\r\nthe red man: the _prise de possession_ by the grasping outer barbarian--\r\nfor such Champlain must have appeared to the descendants of king\r\nDonnacona. In the stream, the ripple of the majestic St. Lawrence caresses\r\nthe dark, indistinct hull of an armed bark: in Indian parlance, a \"big\r\ncanoe [6] with wings\"; on an adjoining height waves languidly with the\r\nlast breath of the breeze the lily standard of old France; on the shore, a\r\ncross recently raised: emblems for us of the past and of the present:\r\nState and Church linked together.\r\n\r\nSuch the objects decernible amid the hoary oaks, nodding pines, and green\r\nhemlocks, below Cape Diamond, on that eventful 3rd of July, 1608.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DWELLING OF CHAMPLAIN.\r\n\r\n\"Above the point of the Island of Orleans,\" says Parkman, \"a constriction\r\nof the vast channel narrows it to a mile; on one hand, the green heights\r\nof Point Levi; on the other, the cliffs of Quebec. Here, a small stream,\r\nthe St. Charles, enters the St. Lawrence, and in the angle betwixt them\r\nrises the promontory, on two sides a natural fortress. Land among the\r\nwalnut-trees that formed a belt between the cliffs and the St. Lawrence.\r\nClimb the steep height, now bearing aloft its ponderous load of churches,\r\nconvents, dwellings, ramparts, and batteries,--there was an accessible\r\npoint, a rough passage, gullied downward where Prescott Gate (in 1871)\r\nopened on the Lower Town. Mount to the highest summit, Cape Diamond, [7]\r\nnow zig-zagged with warlike masonry. Then the fierce sun fell on the bald,\r\nbaking rocks, with its crisped mosses and parched lichens. Two centuries\r\nand-a-half have quickened the solitude with swarming life, covered the\r\ndeep bosom of the river with barge and steamer and gliding sail, and\r\nreared cities and villages on the site of forests; but nothing can destroy\r\nthe surpassing grandeur of the scene.\r\n\r\n\"Grasp the savin anchored in the fissure, lean over the brink of the\r\nprecipice, and look downward, a little to the left, on the belt of woods\r\nwhich covers the strand between the water and the base of the cliffs. Here\r\na gang of axe-men are at work, and Point Levi and Orleans echo the crash\r\nof falling trees.\r\n\r\n\"These axe-men were pioneers of an advancing host,--advancing, it is true,\r\nwith feeble and uncertain progress: priests, soldiers, peasants, feudal\r\nscutcheons, royal insignia. Not the Middle Age, but engendered of it by\r\nthe stronger life of modern centralization; sharply stamped with parental\r\nlikeness, heir to parental weakness and parental force.\r\n\r\n\"A few weeks passed, and a pile of wooden buildings rose on the brink of\r\nthe St. Lawrence, on or near the site of the market-place of the Lower\r\nTown of Quebec. The pencil of Champlain, always regardless of proportion\r\nand perspective, has preserved its semblance. A strong wooden wall,\r\nsurmounted by a gallery loop-holed for musketry, enclosed three buildings,\r\ncontaining quarters for himself and his men, together with a court-yard,\r\nfrom one side of which rose a tall dove-cot, like a belfry. A moat\r\nsurrounded the whole, and two or three small cannon were planted on\r\nsalient platforms towards the river. There was a large magazine near at\r\nhand, and a part of the adjacent ground was laid out as a garden.\"\r\n(_Pioneers of France in the New World_, p. 301.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF DONNACONA.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of September, 1535, under the head \"Shipping News, Port of\r\nQuebec,\" history might jot down some startling items of marine\r\nintelligence; the arrival from sea of three armed vessels--the \"Grande\r\nHermine,\" the \"Petite Hermine,\" and the \"Emerillon.\" One would imagine\r\ntheir entrance in port must have awakened as much curiosity among the\r\nstartled denizens of Stadacona--the Hurons of 1535--as did the anchoring\r\nin our harbour, in August, 1861, of Capt. Vine Hall's leviathan, the\r\n\"Great Eastern.\" Were the French fleet the first European keels which\r\nfurrowed the Laurentian tide under Cape Diamond? We like to think so. Let\r\nthe Basques make good their assumed priority: let them produce their\r\nlogbook, not merely for the latitude of Newfoundland or Tadoussac, but\r\nalso an undisputed entry therein, for the spot where, a century later,\r\nSamuel de Champlain lived, loved, and died. Had the advent of the St. Malo\r\nvikings been heralded by watchful swift-footed retainers to swarthy king\r\nDonnacona, the ruler of the populous town of Stadacona, and a redoubtable\r\nagouhanna of the Huron nation? 'Tis not unlikely.\r\n\r\nAn entry occurs in the diary of Jacques Cartier, commander of the flagship\r\n\"Grande Hermine,\" to the effect that Donnacona, escorted by twelve canoes,\r\nhad met the foreign craft several miles lower than Quebec, where he had\r\nparleyed with his fellow-countrymen, Taiguragny and Domagaya, kidnapped\r\nthe year previous at Gaspé and just brought back by Cartier from France;\r\nthat, dismissing ten of his twelve canoes, the agouhanna had invited and\r\nreceived the French commander in his canoe of state, harangued him, and\r\nreadily accepted from him a collation of bread and wine, which the captain\r\nof the \"Grande Hermine\" (thoughtful host) had brought with him.\r\n\r\nThe meeting over, Donnacona steered for home; and Jacques Cartier ordered\r\nhis boats to be manned and ascended the river to seek for a safe anchorage\r\nfor his ships. He soon found what he sought, entered then the river Saint\r\nCharles, by him called the St. Croix, landed, crossed the meadows, climbed\r\nthe rocks, and threaded the forest. On his return, when he and his party\r\nwere rowing for the ships, they had to stand another harangue from the\r\nbank, from an old chief, surrounded by men, boys and some merry squaws, to\r\nwhom they gave as presents glass beads, &c., when they regained their\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nWhat took place at the interview between the French commander and the\r\nHuron potentate? What were the thoughts, hopes, fears of the grim\r\nchieftain on that fateful September day which brought in across the\r\nAtlantic the first wave of foreign invasion--the outer barbarian to his\r\nforest abode?\r\n\r\nOne would fain depict king Donnacona roaming, solitary and sad; mayhap, on\r\nthe ethereal heights of Cape Diamond, watching, with feelings not\r\nunmingled with alarm, the onward course of the French ships--to him\r\nphantoms of ill-omen careering over the dreary waters--until their white\r\nshrouds gradually disappeared under the shadow of the waving pines and\r\nfar-spreading oaks which then clad the green banks of the lurking,\r\ntortuous St Charles.\r\n\r\nChief Donnacona, beware! O beware!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE \"ANCIENT CAPITAL.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n_QUEBEC--ITS HIGHWAYS AND BY-WAYS, EDIFICES, MONUMENTS, CITIZENS,\r\nLEGENDS, CHRONICLES, AND ANTIQUITIES._\r\n\r\n  \"I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes\r\n  With the memorials and the things of fame\r\n  That do renown this city.\"--(_Shakespeare_.)\r\n\r\nWhat a field here for investigation? Has not each thoroughfare its\r\ndistinctive feature--its saintly, heathenish, courtly, national, heroic,\r\nperhaps burlesque, name? Its peculiar origin? traceable sometimes to a\r\ndim--a forgotten past; sometimes to the utilitarian present time. What\r\ncurious vistas are unfolded in the birth of its edifices--public and\r\nprivate--alive with the memories of their clerical, bellicose,\r\nagricultural or mercantile founders? How much mysterious glamour does not\r\nrelentless time shed over them in its unceasing march? How many\r\nvicissitudes do they undergo before giving way to modern progress, the\r\nexigencies of commerce, the wants or whims of new masters? The edifices,\r\ndid we say? Their origin, their progress, their decay, nay, their\r\ndemolition by the modern iconoclast--have they no teachings? How many\r\nphases in the art of the builder and engineer, from the high-peaked Norman\r\ncottage to the ponderous, drowsy Mansard roof--from Champlain's picket\r\nfort to the modern citadel of Quebec--from our primitive legislative\r\nmeeting-house to our stately Parliament Buildings on the Grande Allée?\r\n\r\nThe streets and by-ways of famous old world cities have found chroniclers,\r\nin some instances of rare ability: Timbs, Howitt, Augustus Sala,\r\nLongfellow, &c. Why should not those of our own land obtain a passing\r\nnotice?\r\n\r\nIs there on American soul a single city intersected by such quaint,\r\ntortuous, legend-loving streets as old Quebec? Is there a town retaining\r\nmore unmistakable vestiges of its rude beginnings--of its pristine,\r\nnarrow, Indian-haunted, forest paths?\r\n\r\nOur streets and lanes bear witness to our dual origin: Champlain,\r\nRichelieu, Buade streets, by their names proclaim the veneration our\r\nfathers had for the memory of men who had watched over the infancy of the\r\ncolony, whilst the mystic, saintly nomenclature of others exhibited the\r\nattachment of the early dwellers in Quebec to the hallowed old Roman faith\r\nwhich presided at their natal hour.\r\n\r\nOne also finds here and there, in the names of certain thoroughfares,\r\ntraces of the sojourn within our walls of popular Governors, famous\r\nViceroys, long since gathered to their fathers, some of whose ashes mingle\r\nin our cemeteries with the dust of our forefathers--[8] Champlain,\r\nFrontenac, Mesy, De Callières, De Vaudreuil, De la Jonquière, Ramsay,\r\nCarleton, Hope, Dalhousie, Richmond and Aylmer.\r\n\r\nA student of history, in the signboards affixed to street corners, loves\r\nto light on the names of men whose memories are fragrant for deeds of\r\nheroism, devotedness, patriotism or learning. Bréboeuf, Champlain,\r\nDollard, Ferland, Garneau, Christie, Turgeon, Plessis, and many others of\r\nblameless and exemplary life--each has his street. We know of a worthy and\r\nlearned old antiquary whose lore and advice has been more than once placed\r\nat our disposal in unravelling the tangled skein on which we are engaged,\r\nwho rejoices that his native city, unlike some of the proud capitals of\r\nEurope, is free from vulgar names, such as \"Tire-Boudin,\" \"P--t--au\r\nD----le,\" in gay Paris, and \"Crutched Friars,\" \"Pall-Mall,\" and \"Mary-le-\r\nbone,\" in great London.\r\n\r\nIn fact, does not history meet you at every turn? Every nook, every lane,\r\nevery square, nay, even the stones and rocks, have a story to tell--a\r\nrecord to unfold--a tale to whisper of savage or civilized warfare--a\r\nmemento to thrill the patriot--a legend of romance or of death--war,\r\nfamine, fires, earthquakes, land and snow-slides, riot?\r\n\r\nIs it not to be apprehended that in time the inmates of such a city might\r\nbecome saturated with the overpowering atmosphere of this romantic past--\r\nfall a prey to an overweening love of old memories--become indifferent,\r\nand deadened to the feelings and requirements of the present? This does\r\nnot necessarily follow. We are, nevertheless, inclined to believe that\r\noutward objects may act powerfully on one's inner nature: that the haunts\r\nand homes of men are not entirely foreign to the thoughts, pursuits and\r\nimpulses, good or bad, of their inmates.\r\n\r\nActive, cultured, bustling, progressive citizens, we would fain connect\r\nwith streets and localities partaking of that character, just as we\r\nassociate cheerful abodes with sunshine, and repulsive dwellings with\r\ndank, perennial shadows.\r\n\r\nMr. N. Legendre, in a small work intituled \"_Les Échos de Quebec_,\" has\r\ngraphically delineated the leading features of several of our\r\nthoroughfares:--\r\n\r\n    \"In a large city each street has its peculiar feature. Such a street\r\n    is sacred to commerce--a private residence in it would appear out of\r\n    place. Such another is devoted to unpretending dwellings: the modest\r\n    grocery shop of the corner looks conscious of being there on\r\n    sufferance only. Here resides the well-to-do--the successful merchant;\r\n    further, much further on, dwell the lowly--the poor. Between both\r\n    points there exists a kind of neutral territory, uniting the\r\n    habitations of both classes. Some of the inmates, when calling, wear\r\n    kid gloves, whilst others go visiting in their shirt sleeves. The same\r\n    individual will even indulge in a cigar or light an ordinary clay\r\n    pipe, according as his course is east or west. All this is so marked,\r\n    so apparent, that it suffices to settle in your mind the street or\r\n    ward to which an individual belongs. The ways of each street vary.\r\n    Here, in front of a well-polished door, stands a showy, emblazoned\r\n    carriage, drawn by thoroughbreds; mark how subdued the tints of the\r\n    livery are. There is, however, something _distingué_ about it, and\r\n    people hurrying past assume a respectful bearing.\r\n\r\n    \"In the next street, the carriage standing at the door is just as\r\n    rich, but its panelling is more gaudy--more striking in colour are the\r\n    horses--more glitter--more profusion about the silver harness\r\n    mountings. Though the livery has more _éclat_, there seems to be\r\n    less distance between the social status of the groom and that of his\r\n    master.\r\n\r\n    \"Walk on further--the private carriage has merged into the public\r\n    conveyance; still further, and you find but the plain _calèche_.\r\n\r\n    \"Finally, every kind of vehicle having disappeared, the house-doors\r\n    are left ajar; the inmates like to fraternise in the street. On fine\r\n    evenings the footpath gets strewed with chairs and benches, occupied\r\n    by men smoking--women chatting _al fresco_ unreservedly--laughing\r\n    that loud laugh which says, \"I don't care who hears me.\" Passers-by\r\n    exchange a remark, children play at foot-ball, while the house-dog,\r\n    exulting in the enjoyment of sweet liberty, gambols in the very midst\r\n    of the happy crowd. These are good streets. One travels over them\r\n    cheerfully and gaily. An atmosphere of rowdyism, theft, wantonness,\r\n    hovers over some thoroughfares. Dread and disgust accompany him who\r\n    saunters over them. Their gates and doorways seem dark--full of pit-\r\n    falls. Iron shutters, thick doors with deep gashes, indicate the\r\n    turbulent nature of their inhabitants. Rude men on the sidepaths stare\r\n    you out of countenance, or make strange signs--a kind of occult\r\n    telegraphy, which makes your flesh creep. To guard against an unseen\r\n    foe, you take to the centre of the street--nasty and muddy though it\r\n    should be,--for there you fancy yourself safe from the blow of a\r\n    skull-cracker, hurled by an unseen hand on watch under a gateway. The\r\n    police make themselves conspicuous here by their absence; 'tis a fit\r\n    spot for midnight murder and robbery--unprovoked, unpunished. Honest\r\n    tradesmen may reside here, but not from choice; they are bound to\r\n    ignore street rows; lending a helping hand to a victim would cause\r\n    them to receive, on the morrow, a notice to quit.\r\n\r\n    \"Be on your guard, if necessity brings you, after nightfall, to this\r\n    unhallowed ground. Danger hovers over, under, round your footsteps. If\r\n    an urchin plays a trick on you at a street corner, heed him not. Try\r\n    and catch him, he will disappear to return with a reinforcement of\r\n    roughs, prepared to avenge his pretended wrongs by violence to your\r\n    person and injury to your purse.\r\n\r\n    \"Should a drunken man hustle you as he passes, do not mind him: it may\r\n    end in a scuffle, out of which you will emerge bruised and with rifled\r\n    pockets.\r\n\r\n    \"We dare not tell you to yield to fear, but be prudent. Though\r\n    prudence may be akin to fear, you never more required all your wits\r\n    about you. It is very unlikely you will ever select this road again,\r\n    though it should be a short cut. Such are some of the dangerous\r\n    streets in their main features. There are thoroughfares, on the other\r\n    hand, to which fancy lends imaginary charms; the street in which you\r\n    live, for instance. You think it better, more agreeable. Each object\r\n    it contains becomes familiar, nay cherished by you--the houses, their\r\n    doors, their gables. The very air seems more genial. A fellowship\r\n    springs up between you and your threshold--your land. You get to\r\n    believe they know you as you know them--softening influences--sweet\r\n    emanations of 'Home.'\"--_Translation._\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE UPPER TOWN._\r\n\r\nThe Upper Town in 1608, with its grand oaks, its walnut trees, its\r\nmajestic elms, when it formed part of the primeval forest, must have been\r\na locality abounding in game. If Champlain, his brother-in-law, Boullé, as\r\nwell as his other friends of the Lower Town, [9] had been less eager in\r\nhunting other inhabitants of the forest infinitely more dreaded (the\r\nIroquois), instead of simply making mention of the foxes which prowled\r\nabout the residency (_l'abitation_), they would have noted down some\r\nof the hunting raids which were probably made on the wooded declivities of\r\nCape Diamond and in the thickets of the Coteau Sainte Geneviève, more\r\nespecially when scurvy or the dearth of provisions rendered indispensable\r\nthe use of fresh meats. We should have heard of grouse, woodcock, hares,\r\nbeavers, foxes, caribou, bears, &c., at that period, as the probable\r\ndenizens of the mounts and valleys of ancient Stadacona.\r\n\r\nIn 1617 the chase had doubtless to give way to tillage of the soil, when\r\nthe first resident of the Upper Town, the apothecary Louis Hébert,\r\nestablished his hearth and home there.\r\n\r\n    \"He presently,\" (1617) says Abbé Ferland, \"commenced to grub up and\r\n    clear the ground on the site on which the Roman Catholic cathedral and\r\n    the Seminary adjoining now stand, and that portion of the upper town\r\n    which extends from St. Famille Street up to the Hôtel-Dieu. He\r\n    constructed a house and a mill near that part of St. Joseph Street\r\n    where it received St. François and St. Xavier Streets. These edifices\r\n    appear to have been the first which were erected in the locality now\r\n    occupied by the upper town.\"\r\n\r\nAt that period there could have existed none other than narrow paths,\r\nirregular avenues following the sinuosities of the forest. In the course\r\nof time these narrow paths were levelled and widened. Champlain and Sir\r\nDavid Kirtk bothered themselves very little with improving highways.\r\nOverseers of roads and _Grand-Voyers_ were not then dreamed of in _La\r\nNouvelle France_: those blessed institutions, macadamized [10] roads, date\r\nfor us from 1841.\r\n\r\nOne of the first projects of Governor de Montmagny, after having fortified\r\nthe place, was to prepare a plan for a city, to lay out, widen and\r\nstraighten the streets, assuredly not without need. Had he further\r\nextended this useful reform, our Municipal Council to-day would have been\r\nspared a great amount of vexation, and the public in general much\r\nannoyance. On the 17th November, 1623, a roadway or ascent leading to the\r\nupper town had been effected, less dangerous than that which had\r\npreviously existed.\r\n\r\n    \"As late as 1682, as appears by an authentic record (_procès-verbal_)\r\n    of the conflagration, this steep road was but fourteen feet wide. It\r\n    was built of branches, covered with earth. Having been rendered\r\n    unserviceable by the fire, the inhabitants had it widened six feet, as\r\n    they had to travel three miles, after the conflagration, to enter the\r\n    upper town by another hill.\"--(T. B. Bédard.)\r\n\r\nIn the summer season, our forefathers journeyed by water, generally in\r\nbirch-bark canoes. In winter they had recourse to snow-shoes.\r\n\r\nTo what year can we fix the advent of wheeled vehicles? We have been\r\nunable to discover.\r\n\r\nThe first horse presented by the inhabitants to the Governor of the colony\r\narrived from France on the 25th June, 1647. [11] Did His Excellency use\r\nhim as a saddle horse only? or, on the occasion of a New Year's day, when\r\nhe went to pay his respects to the Jesuit Fathers, and to the good ladies\r\nof the Ursulines, to present, with the compliments of the season, the\r\nusual New Year's gifts, was he driven in a _cariole_, and in the summer\r\nseason in a _calèche_? Here, again, is a nut to crack for commentators.\r\n[12]\r\n\r\nAlthough there were horned cattle at Quebec in 1623, oxen for the purpose\r\nof ploughing the land were first used on the 27th April, 1628.\r\n\r\n    \"Some animals--cows, sheep, swine, &c.--had been imported as early as\r\n    1608. In 1623, it is recorded that two thousand bundles of fodder were\r\n    brought from the pasture grounds at _Cap Tourmente_ to Quebec for\r\n    winter use.\"--(Miles.)\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of July, 1665, [13] a French ship brought twelve horses. These\r\nwere doubtless the \"mounts\" of the brilliant staff of the Marquis de\r\nTracy, Viceroy. These dashing military followers of Colonel de Salières,\r\nthis _jeunesse dorée_ of the Marquis de Tracy, mounted on these twelve\r\nFrench chargers, which the aborigines named \"the moose-deer (_orignaux_)\r\nof Europe,\" doubtless cut a great figure at Quebec. Did there exist\r\n_Tandems_, driving clubs, in 1665? _Quien sabe?_ A garrison life in 1665-7\r\nand its amusements must have been much what it was one century later, when\r\nthe \"divine\" Emily Montague [14] was corresponding with her dear \"Colonel\r\nRivers,\" from her Sillery abode in 1766; she then, amongst the vehicles in\r\nuse, mentions, _calèches_. [15]\r\n\r\nThey were not all saints such as Paul Dupuy, [16] the patriarchal seigneur\r\nof _Ile-aux-Oies_, these military swells of Colonel de Salières! Major\r\nLafradière, for instance, might have vied with the most outrageous rake in\r\nthe _Guards_ of Queen Victoria who served in the colony two centuries\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nIf there were at Quebec twelve horses for the use of gentlemen, they were\r\ndoubtless not suffered to remain idle in their stables. The rugged paths\r\nof the upper town were levelled and widened; the public highway ceased to\r\nbe reserved for pedestrians only. This is what we wanted to arrive at.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the streets of Quebec grew rapidly into importance in 1665.\r\nImprovements effected during the administration of the Chevalier de\r\nMontmagny had been highly appreciated. The early French had their _Saint\r\nLouis (Grande Allée), Saint Anne, Richelieu, D'Aiguillon, Saint John,\r\nstreets_, to do honour to their Master, Louis XIII.; his Queen the\r\nbeautiful Anne of Austria; his astute Premier the Cardinal of Richelieu;\r\nhis pious niece la Duchesse D'Aiguillon; his land surveyor and engineer\r\nJehan or Jean Bourdon. This last functionary had landed at Quebec on the\r\n8th August, 1634, with a Norman priest, the Abbé Jean LeSueur de Saint-\r\nSauveur, who left his surname (St. Sauveur) to the populous municipality\r\nadjoining St. Roch suburbs. [17]\r\n\r\nIn the last and in the present century, St. Louis Street was inhabited by\r\nmany eminent persons. Chief Justice Sewell resided in the stately old\r\nmansion, up to June 1881 occupied as the Lieutenant-Governor's offices;\r\nthis eminent jurist died in 1839. \"One bright, frosty evening of January\r\n1832,\" says Mr. Chauveau, \"at the close of a numerously attended public\r\nmeeting held at the Ottawa Hotel, to protest against the arrest of Messrs.\r\nTracy, editor of the _Vindicator_, and Duvernay, editor of the _Minerve_,\r\nthe good citizens of Quebec, usually so pacific, rushed in a noisy\r\nprocession, led by a dozen students wearing tri-coloured ribbons in their\r\nbutton-holes, and sang the _Marseillaise_ and the _Parisienne_ under the\r\nwindows of the Chief Justice, whose ear was little accustomed to such a\r\nconcert.\" The ermined sage, 'tis said, was so startled, that he made sure\r\na revolution was breaking out.\r\n\r\n\"Among the fiery, youthful leaders, the loudest in their patriotic\r\noutburst, there was one who would then have been much surprised had any\r\none predicted that after being President of the Legislative Council, Prime\r\nMinister of the Canadas, and knighted by H. R. H. the Prince of Wales in\r\nperson, he would one day, as Lieutenant-Governor, enter in state this same\r\nformer residence of Chief Justice Sewell, whilst the cannon of Britain\r\nwould roar a welcome, the flag of England stream over his head, and a\r\nBritish regiment present arms to him.\" Such, however, has been the fate of\r\nSir Narcissus Fortunatus Belleau.\r\n\r\nThe mansion of M. de Lotbinière, in St. Louis street, was the residence of\r\nMadame Pean, the _chère amie_ of M. Bigot the Intendant. The late\r\nJudge Elmsley resided there about the year 1813; Government subsequently\r\npurchased it to serve as an officers' barracks. Nearly opposite the old\r\nCourt-House (burned in 1872), stands the \"Kent House,\" in which His Royal\r\nHighness the late Duke of Kent resided in summer, 1791-3. [18] No. 42 St.\r\nLouis Street is the house [19] which belonged to the cooper, François\r\nGobert; it now has become historical. In it were deposited the remains of\r\nGeneral Montgomery on the 31st December, 1775. This summer it is leased by\r\nLouis Gonzague Baillargé, Esq., the proprietor, to Widow Pigott, whose\r\nlate husband was in the \"B\" Battery.\r\n\r\nIn the street sacred to Louis XIII., St. Louis street, Messrs. Brown [20]\r\n& Gilmor established, in 1764, [21] their printing office for the _Quebec\r\nGazette_, \"two doors higher up than the Secretary's Office,\" wherever this\r\nlatter may have stood. The _Gazette_ office was subsequently removed to\r\nParloir Street, and eventually settled down for many a long year at the\r\ncorner of Mountain Hill, half-way up, facing _Break-Neck_ steps,--the\r\nhouse was, with many others, removed in 1850 to widen Mountain Street.\r\nAccording to a tradition published in the _Gazette_ of the 2nd May, 1848,\r\nthe prospectus of this paper had, it would appear, been printed in the\r\nprinting office of Benjamin Franklin.\r\n\r\nThis venerable sheet, which had existed one hundred and ten years, when it\r\nwas merged, in 1874, by purchase of the copyright, into the _Morning\r\nChronicle_, in its early days, was nearly the sole exponent of the wants--\r\nof the gossip (in prose and in verse)--and of the daily events of Quebec.\r\nAs such, though, from the standard of to-day, it may seem quaint and puny,\r\nstill it does not appear an untruthful mirror of social life in the\r\nancient capital. Its centenary number of June, 1864, with the fyles of\r\nthe _Gazette_ for 1783, have furnished the scholarly author of the\r\n\"Prophecy of Merlin,\" John S. Reade, with material for an excellent sketch\r\nof this pioneer of Canadian journalism, of which our space will permit us\r\nto give but some short extracts:--\r\n\r\n    \"The first number of the _Quebec Gazette_, judged by the _fac-simile_\r\n    before me, was a very unpretending production. It consists of four\r\n    folio pages, two columns to each page, with the exception of the\r\n    'Printer's Address to the Public,' which takes up the full width of\r\n    the page, and is written in French and English, the matter in both\r\n    languages being the same, with the exception of a Masonic\r\n    advertisement, which is in English only. In the address, accuracy,\r\n    freedom and impartiality are promised in the conduct of the paper. The\r\n    design of the publishers includes 'a view of foreign affairs and\r\n    political transactions from which a judgment may be formed of the\r\n    interests and connections of the several powers of Europe'; and care\r\n    is to be taken 'to collect the transactions and occurrences of our\r\n    mother-country, and to introduce every remarkable event, uncommon\r\n    debates, extraordinary performance and interesting turn of affairs\r\n    that shall be thought to merit the notice of the reader as matter of\r\n    entertainment, or that can be of service to the publick as inhabitants\r\n    of an English colony.' Attention is also to be given to the affairs of\r\n    the American colonies and West India Islands; and, in the absence of\r\n    foreign intelligence, the reader is to be presented with 'such\r\n    originals, in prose and verse, as will please the fancy and instruct\r\n    the judgment. And,' the address continues, 'here we beg leave to\r\n    observe that we shall have nothing so much at heart as the support of\r\n    virtue and morality and the noble cause of liberty. The refined\r\n    amusements of literature and the pleasing veins of well-pointed wit\r\n    shall also be considered as necessary to the collection; interspersed\r\n    with other chosen pieces and curious essays extracted from the most\r\n    celebrated authors; so that, blending philosophy with politicks,\r\n    history, &c., the youth of both sexes will be improved, and persons of\r\n    all ranks agreeably and usefully entertained.'\r\n\r\n    \"As an inducement to advertisers, it is held out that the circulation\r\n    of the _Gazette_ will extend, not only through the British colonies,\r\n    but also through the West India Islands and the trading ports of Great\r\n    Britain and Ireland. The address very sensibly concludes with the\r\n    following remarks, which, however, cast a shade over the rather\r\n    tedious prolegomena: 'Our intention to please the whole, without\r\n    offence to any individual, will be better evinced by our practice than\r\n    by writing volumes on this subject. This one thing we beg may be\r\n    believed, that party prejudice or private scandal will never find a\r\n    place in this paper.'\r\n\r\n    \"With this large promise began the first Canadian newspaper on the\r\n    21st of June, 1764.\r\n\r\n    \"The news in the first number is all foreign. There are despatches\r\n    from Riga, St. Petersburg, Rome, Hermanstadt, Dantzic, Vienna,\r\n    Florence and Utrecht, the dates ranging from the 8th of March to the\r\n    11th of April. There are also items of news from New York, bearing\r\n    date the 3rd, and from Philadelphia the 7th of May. News-collecting\r\n    was then a slow process, by land as well as by sea.\r\n\r\n    \"Of the despatches, the following is of historical importance:\r\n    'London, March 10th. It is said that a scheme of taxation of our\r\n    American colonies has for some time been in agitation, that it had\r\n    been previously debated in the Parliament whether they had power to\r\n    lay a tax on colonies which had no representative in Parliament and\r\n    determined in the affirmative,' etc. The occasional insertion of a\r\n    dash instead of a name, or the wary mention of a 'certain great\r\n    leader' or 'a certain great personage' tell a simple tale of the\r\n    jealousy with which the press was then regarded both in England and on\r\n    the continent. The prosecution of Smollett, Cave, Wilkes and others\r\n    were still fresh in the minds of printers and writers.\r\n\r\n    \"Another despatch informs the readers of the _Gazette_ of an _arrêt_\r\n    lately issued for the banishment of the Jesuits from France, and\r\n    another of a deputation of journeymen silk weavers who waited on the\r\n    King at St. James with a petition setting forth their grievances from\r\n    the clandestine importation of French silk, to which His Majesty\r\n    graciously replied, promising to have the matter properly laid before\r\n    Parliament.\r\n\r\n    \"An extract from a letter from Virginia gives an account of some\r\n    Indian outrages, and there is some other intelligence of a similar\r\n    nature. The other news is of a like temporary interest.\r\n\r\n    \"I have already mentioned a masonic advertisement. I now give it in\r\n    full:\r\n\r\n    NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN,\r\n\r\n    That on _Sunday_, the 24th, being the Festival of _St. Jhon_ (sic),\r\n    such strange BRETHREN who may have a desire of joining the Merchants\r\n    Lodge, No. 1, _Quebec_, may obtain Liberty, by applying to _Miles\r\n    Prenties_, at the Sun, in _St. John Street_, who has Tickets, Price\r\n    _Five Shillings_, for that Day.\r\n\r\n    \"One thing is evident, that a printing establishment of 1764 had to be\r\n    supplied with abundance of italics and capitals to meet the exigencies\r\n    of the typographic fashion of the time.\r\n\r\n    \"Of the two remaining advertisements, one is an order of the Collector\r\n    of Customs for the prevention of composition for duties and the other\r\n    gives a list of 'an assortment of goods,' 'just imported from London,\r\n    and to be sold at the lowest prices by John Baird, in the upper part\r\n    of Mr. Henry Morin's house at the entry of the Cul de Sac'--an\r\n    assortment which is very comprehensive, ranging from leather breeches\r\n    to frying-pans. From this and subsequent trade advertisements we are\r\n    able to gather some not unimportant information as to the manner of\r\n    living of the citizens of Quebec in those days.\" [22]\r\n\r\nWilliam Brown was succeeded in the editorship and proprietorship of this\r\nvenerable sheet by his nephew, Samuel Neilson, the elder brother of John\r\nNeilson, who for years was the trusted member for the County of Quebec; as\r\nwidely known as a journalist--a legislator--in 1822 our worthy ambassador\r\nto England--as he was respected as a patriot.\r\n\r\nSamuel Neilson had died in 1793;--his young brother and _protégé_, John,\r\nborn at Dornald, in Scotland, in 1776, being, in 1793, a minor, the\r\n_Gazette_ was conducted by the late Rev. Dr. Alex. Sparks, his guardian,\r\nuntil 1796. When John Neilson became of full age, he assumed the direction\r\nof the paper for more than half a century, either in his own name or in\r\nthat of his son Samuel. Hon. John Neilson closed his long and spotless\r\ncareer, at his country seat (Dornald), at Cap Rouge, on the 1st February,\r\n1848, aged 71 years. Who has not heard of the Nestor of the Canadian\r\nPress, honest John Neilson?  May his memory ever remain bright and\r\nfragrant--a beacon to guide those treading the intricate paths of\r\nJournalism--a shining light to generations yet unborn!\r\n\r\nIn a pretty rustic cemetery, the site of which was presented by himself to\r\nthe Presbyterian Church of Valcartier, near Quebec, were laid, on the 4th\r\nFebruary, 1848, the remains of this patriotic man--escorted by citizens of\r\nevery origin, after an eloquent address had been delivered by the Rev. Dr.\r\nJohn Cook, the present pastor of St Andrew's Church.\r\n\r\nThe Literary and Historical Society of Quebec is indebted to his son John\r\nNeilson, of Dornald, for a precious relic, the iron lever of the first\r\nPress used at Quebec in 1764--precious, indeed, as a souvenir of Canadian\r\nJournalism.\r\n\r\nThere are indeed many Scotch names associated with the Quebec Press. Space\r\nprecludes us from enlarging more on this subject. In alluding to notable\r\nQuebec Journalists we are bound to name Daniel Wilkie, LL.D., the editor\r\nof the Quebec _Star_,--a literary gazette--in 1818--still better\r\nremembered as the esteemed instructor of Quebec youth for forty years.\r\n\r\nDr. Wilkie was born at Tollcross, in Scotland, in 1777, one year later\r\nthan John Neilson: he settled in Quebec in 1803, and died here on the 10th\r\nMay, 1851. His pupils had the following truthful words inscribed on the\r\nmonument they erected to their patron in Mount Hermon cemetery:\r\n\r\n  \"He was a learned scholar\r\n  And indefatigable student of philosophy and letters,\r\n  An able and successful instructor of youth,\r\n  Of genuine uprightness and guileless simplicity\r\n  A devout, benevolent and public spirited man.\"\r\n\r\nThe Abbé Vignal resided at the corner of St. Louis and Parloir street,\r\nprevious to joining the _Sulpiciens_. In October, 1661, he was roasted\r\nalive and partly eaten by the Mohawks at Isle à la Pierre, _la Prairie de\r\nla Magdeleine_, near Montreal. In our day, the judicial and parliamentary\r\nheads, and the Bar have monopolized the street. In it have resided at\r\nvarious times, Sir N. F. Belleau, Chief Justice Duval, the Judges\r\nTaschereau, Tessier, Bossé, Caron, Routhier; Hon. H. L. Langevin, P.\r\nPelletier, M.P.; Messrs. Bossé, Baby, Alleyn, Languedoc, Tessier,\r\nChouinard, Hamel, Gauthier, Bradley, Dunbar, _cum multis aliis_, some\r\nof whose rustic clients are as early birds as those in the days of Horace,\r\nand scruple not to wake up their trusted advisers, \"_sub galli cantum_.\"\r\n[23]\r\n\r\nSt. Louis street legal luminaries are careful not to endanger their hard-\r\nearned reputations by delivering their consultations with the oracular,\r\nSolon-like gravity of the barristers who flourished in the palmy days of\r\nHortensius or Justinian. 'Twould be an anachronism.  The traditional fee,\r\nhowever, is rarely omitted. A busy day, indeed, in this neighborhood,\r\nwatched over by the shades of Louis XIII., St. Louis street, is, in each\r\nyear, the 1st of September, when the close of the sultry midsummer\r\nvacation brings round \"the first day of term,\" then\r\n\r\n  \"Grave gownsmen, full of thought, to 'chambers hie,\r\n  From court to court, perplexed, attorneys fly;\r\n  ... each! Quick scouring to and thro',\r\n  And wishing he could cut himself in two\r\n  That he two places at a time might reach,\r\n  So he could charge his six and eightpence each.\"\r\n               --(_The Bar, a Poem_, 1825.)\r\n\r\nMatters judicial, legal, financial, etc., have much changed--we are\r\ninclined to say improved--in Canada, especially for the Judges. \"I will\r\nnot say,\" writes the satirical La Hontan, \"that justice is more chaste and\r\ndisinterested here than in France; but, at least, if she is sold, she is\r\nsold cheaper. We do not pass through the clutches of advocates, the talons\r\nof attorneys and the claws of clerks. These vermin do not infest Canada\r\nyet. Everybody pleads his own cause. Our Themis is prompt, and she does\r\nnot bristle with fees, costs and charges. The judges have only four\r\nhundred francs a year--a great temptation to look for law in the bottom of\r\nthe suitor's purse. Four hundred francs! Not enough to buy a cap and gown,\r\nso these gentry never wear them.\" [24] Justice is not now sold, either in\r\nQuebec or elsewhere, but judges, on the other hand, viz., in Ottawa,\r\nreceive, not \"four hundred francs,\" but thirty-five thousand francs\r\n($7,000) a year, and have \"enough to buy a cap and a gown,\" yea, and a\r\nbrilliant red one, to boot. _Voilà un progrès._\r\n\r\nOn an old plan, in our possession, of the Cape and Mount Carmel, showing\r\nthe whereabouts of lots and the names of their proprietors, drawn by Le\r\nMaître Lamorille, a royal surveyor, bearing date 20th May, 1756, and duly\r\nsanctioned by the French Intendant Bigot on the 23rd January, 1759, can be\r\nseen at Mont Carmel, St. Louis street, a lot marked \"No. 16, M. Pean.\"\r\n[25]\r\n\r\nM. Pean, Town Major of Quebec, a trusted confederate of the Intendant\r\nBigot, the proprietor of this land, was the husband of the beautiful\r\nAngélique de Meloises, the _inamorata_ of the voluptuous and munificent\r\nIntendant. In her youth she had been a pupil of the Ursuline nuns. In his\r\n_Reminiscences of Quebec_, 2nd edition republished in 1859, Col. Cockburn\r\nthus alludes to this St. Louis street house (now Dominion property and\r\noccupied by Lt.-Col. Forest and Lt.-Col. D'Orsonnes). \"It sometimes happened\r\nin those days, when a gentleman possessed a very handsome wife, that the\r\nhusband was sent to take charge of a distant post, where he was sure to\r\nmake his fortune. Bigot's _chère amie_ was Madame P---- in consequence of\r\nwhich as a matter of course, Mr. P---- became prodigiously wealthy. Bigot\r\nhad a house that stood where the officers barracks in St Louis street, now\r\n(1851) stands. One New Year's Day he presented this house to Madame P----\r\nas a New Year's gift.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Kirby, in his \"_Chien d'Or_,\" a historical novel of rare Merit,\r\nthus recalls this house--\"The family mansion of the des Meloises was a\r\ntall and rather pretentious edifice overlooking the fashionable rue St\r\nLouis where it still stands, old and melancholy as if mourning over its\r\ndeparted splendors. Few eyes look up now-a-days to its broad façade. It\r\nwas otherwise when the beautiful Angélique de Meloises sat of summer\r\nevenings on the balcony, surrounded by a bevy of Quebec's fairest\r\ndaughters, who loved to haunt her windows where they could see and be seen\r\nto the best advantage exchanging salutations, smiles and repartees with\r\nthe gay young officers and gallants who rode or walked along its lively\r\nthoroughfare.\"\r\n\r\nThe novelist has selected this historic house for the meeting of the\r\nlovers, on Christmas Eve 1748. Here Le Gardeur de Repentigny, the loyal\r\nand devoted cavalier was to meet the fascinating, but luckless Cleopatra\r\nof St Louis street a century ago and more.\r\n\r\n    \"As Le Gardeur spoke, adds Mr. Kirby; a strain of heavenly harmony\r\n    arose from the chapel of the Convent of the Ursulines, where they were\r\n    celebrating midnight service for the safety of New France. Amid the\r\n    sweet voices that floated up on the notes of the pealing organ was\r\n    clearly distinguished that of Mère St. Borgia, the aunt of Angélique,\r\n    who led the choir of nuns. In trills and cadences of divine melody,\r\n    the voice of Mère St. Borgia rose higher and higher, like a spirit\r\n    mounting the skies. The words were indistinct, but Angélique knew them\r\n    by heart. She had visited her aunt in the convent, and had learned the\r\n    new hymn composed by her for the solemn occasion. As they listened\r\n    with quiet awe to the supplicating strain, Angélique repeated to Le\r\n    Gardeur the words of the hymn as it was sung by the choir of nuns:--\r\n\r\n      Soutenez, grande Reine,\r\n        Notre pauvre pays!\r\n      Il est votre domaine,\r\n        Faites fleurir nos lis!\r\n      L'Anglais sur nos frontières,\r\n        Porte ses étandards\r\n      Exaucez nos prières\r\n        Protégez nos remparts!\"\r\n\r\n    \"The hymn ceased. Both stood mute until the watchman cried the hour in\r\n    the silent street.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall not follow further the beautiful but heartless Cleopatra through\r\nher deadly schemes of conquest, or in her flight after the Intendant.\r\nSixteen years after the departure of the Court beauty, on a dark, stormy\r\nwinter morning, the 31st December, 1775, a loud note of alarm awoke at\r\ndawn from their slumbers the demure denizens of St. Louis street. It was\r\nthe captain of the guard, Captain Malcolm Fraser, [26] formerly of\r\nFraser's Highlanders (78th), but now of the 84th Royal Emigrants, Col.\r\nAllan McLean--who, on going his rounds between 4 and 5 in the morning, had\r\npassed the guard at St. Louis gate, and had noticed flashes like lightning\r\non the heights without the works. Convinced it was for an attack, he sent\r\nnotice to all the guards, and ran down St. Louis street, calling \"Turn\r\nout\" as loud and as often as he could. The alarm soon caught the quick ear\r\nof the General (Guy Carleton) and the picquet at the Récollets Convent was\r\ninstantly turned out. Captain Fraser's alarm was timely. Before eight\r\no'clock on that memorable December morning, Benedict Arnold had been\r\nwounded, routed at the Sault au Matelot barricade, and 427 of his daring\r\nmen taken prisoners of war, whilst the Commander-in-Chief, Brigadier-\r\nGeneral Richard Montgomery and thirteen followers were lying dead in their\r\nsnowy shrouds at Près-de-Ville. The rest had taken flight.\r\n\r\nThe saddest sight ever witnessed in St. Louis street was that which\r\nheralded to its awe-struck denizens the issue of the momentous conflict on\r\nthe adjoining heights in Sept. 1759.\r\n\r\nIn the paper read by the writer before the Literary and Historical Society\r\nof Quebec, on the 3rd of December, 1879, the mournful appearance of the\r\nFrench hero, Montcalm, is thus described:--\r\n\r\n    \"The morning of the 13th September, 1759, has dawned; an astounding\r\n    rumour fills the air; the citizens of Quebec repeat with bated breath:\r\n    _Wolfe's army is at the gates of the city._\r\n\r\n    \"Hark! What means this deafening roar of artillery--this hissing of\r\n    shot and shell--these rolling, murderous volleys of musketry in the\r\n    direction of the heights of Abraham?\r\n\r\n    \"Hark! to these loud cheers--British cheers mixed with the discordant\r\n    yells of those savage warriors, Fraser's Highlanders! The fate of a\r\n    continent has just been decided. The genius of William Pitt has\r\n    triumphed, though victory was bought at a dear price.\r\n\r\n    \"Here comes from St. Louis gate [27] on his way to the Château, pale,\r\n    but dauntless--on a black charger--supported by two grenadiers, one on\r\n    each side of his horse, a General officer wearing the uniform which\r\n    won at Fontenoy, won at Laufeldt, as well as at the Monongahela [28]\r\n    and at Carillon. [29] A bloody trail crimsons the _Grande Allée_,\r\n    St. Louis street, on that gloomy September day. My friends, 'tis the\r\n    life-blood of a hero. Drop in reverential silence, on the moistened\r\n    earth, a sympathetic tear; France's chivalrous leader, the victor of\r\n    many battle-fields, has returned from his last campaign.\r\n\r\n    \"_Oh! mon Dieu! mon Dieu! Le Marquis est tué,_\" is repeated by female\r\n    voices as the death-stricken but intrepid general glides past, to\r\n    which he courteously replies, trying to quiet their fears, 'that he\r\n    was not seriously hurt, and not to distress themselves on his\r\n    account.' '_Ce n'est rien! ce n'est rien! ne vous affligez pas pour\r\n    moi, mes bonnes amies._'\r\n\r\n    \"You have all heard the account of the death-bed scene--of his tender\r\n    solicitude for the good name of France--of his dying injunctions to de\r\n    Ramesay, the King's lieutenant in charge of the Quebec Garrison, and\r\n    to the Colonel of the Roussillon Regiment. '_Gentlemen, to your\r\n    keeping I commend the honour of France. Endeavour to secure the\r\n    retreat of my army to-night beyond Cape Rouge. As for myself, I shall\r\n    pass the night with God, and prepare for death._'\r\n\r\n    \"At nine o'clock in the evening of that 14th of September, 1759, a\r\n    funeral cortege, issuing from the castle, winds its way through the\r\n    dark and obstructed streets to the little church of the Ursulines.\r\n    With the heavy tread of the coffin-bearers keeps time the measured\r\n    footsteps of the military escort. De Ramesay and the other officers of\r\n    the garrison following to their resting-place the lifeless remains of\r\n    their illustrious commander-in-chief. No martial pomp was displayed\r\n    around that humble bier, but the hero who had afforded at his dying\r\n    hour the sublime spectacle of a Christian yielding up his soul to God\r\n    in the most admirable sentiments of faith and resignation, was not\r\n    laid in unconsecrated ground. No burial rite could be more solemn than\r\n    that hurried evening service performed by torchlight under the\r\n    dilapidated roof of a sacred asylum, where the soil had been first\r\n    laid bare by one of the rude engines of war--a bombshell. The grave\r\n    tones of the priests murmuring the _Libera me, Domine_ were responded\r\n    to by the sighs and tears of consecrated virgins, henceforth the\r\n    guardians of the precious deposit, which, but for inevitable fate,\r\n    would have been reserved to honour some proud mausoleum. With gloomy\r\n    forebodings and bitter thoughts de Ramesay and his companions in arms\r\n    withdrew in silence.\r\n\r\n    \"A few citizens had gathered in, and among the rest one led by the\r\n    hand his little daughter, who, looking into the grave, saw and\r\n    remembered, more than three fourths of a century later, the rough\r\n    wooden box, which was all the ruined city could afford to enclose the\r\n    remains of her defender.\r\n\r\n    \"The skull of the Marquis of Montcalm, exhumed in the presence of the\r\n    Rev. Abbé Maguire, almoner, in 1833, many here present, I am sure,\r\n    have seen in a casket, reverently exposed in the room of the present\r\n    almoner of the Ursuline Convent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIETY UNDER EARLY ENGLISH RULE.\r\n\r\nUnder the sway of the English Government, Canada soon recovered her wonted\r\ngaiety, and the social condition of the country, following on so large an\r\nadmixture of a different nationality, is a subject stimulating inquiry. We\r\ncannot do better than have recourse again to Mr. Reade's graphic pen in an\r\narticle on \"British Canada in the Last Century,\" contributed to the New\r\nDominion Monthly, and suggested by the _Quebec Gazette_ of 1783, the St.\r\nLouis Street journal above quoted:--\r\n\r\n    \"If there were nothing left to the enquirer but the single\r\n    advertisement of John Baird, which appeared in the first number of the\r\n    Quebec _Gazette_, as the basis of information, he might, with a\r\n    moderate power of inductiveness, construct a very fair account of the\r\n    mode of living pursued at Quebec a hundred years ago. But the fact is\r\n    he is overwhelmed with _data_, and his chief difficulty is to\r\n    choose with discrimination. There is certainly ample evidence to show\r\n    that the inhabitants of the ancient capital did not stint themselves\r\n    in the luxuries of their day and generation. The amount of wine which\r\n    they consumed was something enormous, nor are we wanting in proof that\r\n    it was used among the better classes to an extent which public opinion\r\n    would not allow at the present day. A correspondent, more inclined to\r\n    sobriety than his fellow citizens, after complimenting Quebec society\r\n    for its politeness and hospitality--in which qualities it still\r\n    excels--finds fault with the social custom by which 'men are excited\r\n    and provoked by healths and rounds of toasts to fuddle themselves in\r\n    as indecent a manner as if they were in a tavern or in the most\r\n    unpolished company.' In connection with this state of affairs it may\r\n    be interesting to give the prices of different wines at that period:\r\n    Fine Old Red Port was sold at 17 shillings a dozen, Claret at 12s.,\r\n    Priniac at 17s.; Muscat at 24s., Modena at 27s., Malaga at 17s.;\r\n    Lisbon at 17s.; Fyall at 15s.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Simon Fraser, perhaps one of those converted Jacobites who scaled\r\n    the height of Quebec, in 1759, turned civilian, gives us the price of\r\n    tea: Single Green tea is 13s. a pound, Best Hyson, 25s; Bohea, 6/6d.\r\n    Pity that tea was so dear and wine so cheap! Bread was very cheap, and\r\n    large quantities of wheat were exported--whereas now Lower Canada has\r\n    to import the most of its cereals. Great attention was paid to dress,\r\n    and though no sumptuary laws were in force, the principle on which\r\n    they were founded was still remembered, and attire bespoke the\r\n    position of the wearer. The articles and styles advertised by drapers\r\n    and tailors are, of course, in accordance with the manufacture and\r\n    fashion of the time. The lists of dry goods and fancy goods are very\r\n    full, but to those engaged in the business now the antique\r\n    nomenclature might be puzzling. Irish linen was sold at from 1/6 to\r\n    7/0 per yard, and Irish sheeting at from 1/6 to 2/6. We are not told\r\n    the prices of tammies or durants, romals or molletons, cades or\r\n    shalloons, but we are always carefully informed that they may be had\r\n    at the lowest prices. Pains are also taken, in many instances, to\r\n    indicate the previous experience of the advertisers. Thus tailors and\r\n    mantua-makers generally 'hail from' London. Mr. Hanna, the watch-\r\n    maker, whose time-keepers still tick attestation to his industry and\r\n    popularity, is proud to have learned his trade by the banks of the\r\n    Liffey. Mr. Bennie, tailor and habit-maker, from Edinburgh, 'begs\r\n    leave to inform the public that all gentlemen and ladies who will be\r\n    so good as to favour him with their custom may depend upon being\r\n    faithfully served on the shortest notice and in the newest fashion for\r\n    ready money or short credit, on the most reasonable terms.' There were\r\n    peruke-makers in those days and they seem to have thriven well in\r\n    Quebec, if we may judge by their advertised sales of real estate.\r\n    Jewellers also seem to have had plenty to do, as they advertise\r\n    occasionally for assistants instead of customers. Furriers, hatters,\r\n    _couturières_ and shoemakers also present their claims to public\r\n    favour, so that there was no lack of provision for the wants of the\r\n    outer man.\r\n\r\n    \"From the general tone and nature of the advertisements it is easily\r\n    inferred that the society of Quebec soon after the conquest was gay\r\n    and luxurious. We are not surprised when we find that a theatrical\r\n    company found it worth their while to take up their abode there. Among\r\n    the pieces played we find Home's 'Douglas' and Otway's 'Venice\r\n    Preserved.' The doors were opened at five o'clock and the\r\n    entertainment began at half-past six! The frequenters of the 'Thespian\r\n    Theatre' were a select and privileged class, and only subscribers were\r\n    admitted. Private theatricals were much in vogue; and, indeed, there\r\n    was every variety of amusement which climate could allow or suggest,\r\n    or the lovers of frolic devise. Nor were bards wanting to celebrate\r\n    these festivities, witness the following extract from a 'carioling\r\n    song:'\r\n\r\n      \"'Not all the fragrance of the spring,\r\n      Nor all the tuneful birds that sing,\r\n      Can to the _Plains_ the ladies bring,\r\n        So soon as carioling.\r\n\r\n      \"'Nor Venus with the winged Loves,\r\n      Drawn by her sparrows or her doves,\r\n      So gracefully or swiftly moves,\r\n        As ladies carioling,\"\r\n\r\n    \"Another poet, whose mind was evidently less healthily braced by out-\r\n    door exercise, gives us a very different picture of the recreations of\r\n    the period. It occurs in the course of an essay in versification\r\n    called 'Evening.'\r\n\r\n      \"'Now minuets o'er, the country dance is formed\r\n        See every little female passion rise,\r\n      By jealousy, by pride, by envy warmed,\r\n        See Adam's child the child of Eve despise.\r\n\r\n      \"'With turned-up nose Belinda Chloe eyes,\r\n        Chloe Myrtilla with contempt surveys,\r\n      \"What! with that creature dance!\" Cleora cries,\r\n        \"That vulgar wretch!

She _was_ a young lady once; and, if\r\n    we may believe her panegyrist, was a beauty in her day.

The poet seems to have been inspired by\r\n    indignation at the insinuations of 'Asmodeus,' for he begins thus.\r\n\r\n      \"'Muses, how oft does Satire's vengeful gall\r\n        Invoke your powers to aid its bitter sting,'\r\n\r\n    and then he prefers his own claims to the favor of the Nine\r\n\r\n      \"'Sure you will rather listen to my call,\r\n        Since beauty and Quebec's fair nymphs I sing'\r\n\r\n    \"It seems his petition was heard, for he forthwith begins his\r\n    laudation:\r\n\r\n      \"'Henceforth Diana in Miss S--ps--n see,\r\n        As noble and majestic is her air,\r\n      Nor can fair Venus, W--lc--s, vie with thee,\r\n        Nor all her heavenly charms with thine compare.\r\n\r\n      \"'Around the B--ch--rs Juno's glory plays,\r\n        Her power and charms in them attract our praise\r\n      Minerva, who with beauty's queen did vie\r\n        And patronized all the finer arts,\r\n      Crowned the McN--ls with her divinity,\r\n        Crowned them the queens of beauty and of hearts.\r\n\r\n      \"'Unto fair F--m--n now I turn my song,\r\n        Lovely in all she says, in all she does,\r\n      Lo! to her toilet see each goddess throng,\r\n        One cannot all, but each a charm bestows\r\n      Could all these beauties in one female be,\r\n        _Her_ whom I sing would be the lovely she.'\r\n\r\n    \"This effusion provoked more criticism than many a book of poetry is\r\n    subjected to nowadays, and the censors were in their turn criticized\r\n    by others. Montreal even took part in this literary tournament. But we\r\n    are left in the dark as to its effect on the spirits, tempers or\r\n    destinies of Miss MacCulloch and her sister belles.\r\n\r\n    \"It would seem that the author was a young clerk or merchant of\r\n    Quebec, as one of the critics spitefully tells him not to desert his\r\n    shop. The ladies themselves do not escape, one writer suggesting that\r\n    they are coquettish enough already without making them more so. The\r\n    Montreal correspondent is warned off as an intruder, and told that he\r\n    had better have saved his ninepence of postage money. Just imagine\r\n    this silly acrostic furnishing gossip for Quebec and matter for the\r\n    _Gazette_ for two months!\r\n\r\n    \"As another note of the state of society at that time may be mentioned\r\n    occasional advertisements for the sale of negro lads and wenches, or\r\n    of rewards for the recovery and restoration of missing ones. Slavery\r\n    was not abolished in Lower Canada till 1803. In Upper Canada, as a\r\n    separate province, it hardly ever existed. Did the manumitted blacks\r\n    remain in Canada after their liberation, or did they seek a more\r\n    congenial climate?\r\n\r\n    \"For education there does not seem to have been any public provision,\r\n    but private schools for both sexes were numerous. These were probably\r\n    expensive, so that the poorer classes were virtually debarred from the\r\n    advantages of learning. The instruction of Catholic children was in\r\n    the hands of the clergy, and it may be that in some of the conventual\r\n    schools a certain number were admitted free of expense or at reduced\r\n    rates. It would appear that some of the young ladies were sent to\r\n    English boarding-schools, if we may judge by advertisements in which\r\n    the advantages of these institutions are set forth.\r\n\r\n    \"A Miss or Mrs. Agnes Galbraith not only taught school, but also\r\n    carried on the millinery business, to which she informs the public\r\n    that she had served a regular apprenticeship, besides having been 'a\r\n    governess for several years to a genteel boarding-school.'\r\n\r\n    \"The principal of a boys' school who resided at Three Rivers\r\n    'respectfully begs leave to remark that he means to presume no further\r\n    than he is perfectly able to perform, and build his hope of\r\n    encouragement on no other foundation than his assiduity to merit it.'\r\n    His 'course' is nevertheless a pretty full one, including English,\r\n    French, Latin, Greek, writing in a natural and easy style after the\r\n    best precedents; arithmetic, vulgar and decimal; geography, with use\r\n    of the globes; geometry, navigation with all the _late modern_\r\n    improvements; algebra, and every other useful and ornamental branch of\r\n    mathematical learning. Some of the other male teachers write in a\r\n    similar strain of their qualifications.\"\r\n\r\n    \"It may be inferred, then, that the wealthier classes of Canada in\r\n    those days had much the same advantages of culture as their friends in\r\n    England. Intercourse with the mother country was much more general and\r\n    frequent than might be imagined, and, no doubt, many young gentlemen,\r\n    after a preliminary training at a colonial academy, were sent home to\r\n    enter some of the English public schools or universities. From the\r\n    higher ranks downwards education varied till it reached the 'masses,'\r\n    with whom its index was a cipher. There is no reason to suppose,\r\n    however, that the population of Canada, taken as a whole, was less\r\n    cultivated during the last forty years of the eighteenth century than\r\n    that of any European nation during the same period. From the\r\n    consideration of education, one naturally passes to that of crime.\r\n    Thefts were frequent, and sometimes committed on a large scale. The\r\n    punishment was whipping at a cart-tail through the streets of the\r\n    city--the culprits themselves being whipped and whipsters in turn.\r\n    Assault, stealing in private houses, and highway robbery were punished\r\n    with death. The expiation for manslaughter was being branded in the\r\n    hand which did the deed. Desertion was very frequent, especially among\r\n    the Hessians and Brunswickers then stationed in Canada. In some cases\r\n    they were promised pardon if they returned to their regiments, but woe\r\n    to them if they returned against their will! Towards the end of the\r\n    year 1783 'Gustavus Leight, a German doctor, confined for felony,\r\n    broke out of His Majesty's jail at Quebec.' He was '25 years of age,\r\n    about 5 feet high.' We are not told whether or not he was captured as\r\n    the advertisement is continued to the end of the year, but if he did\r\n    not change his dress he could not have succeeded in baffling very long\r\n    the keen eye of a detective, for \"he had on, when he made his escape,\r\n    a brown coat, red plush waistcoat, white stockings and cock'd hat.' If\r\n    such a gentleman made his appearance in the streets of any Canadian\r\n    city to-day, he would certainly be requested to 'move on,' or asked to\r\n    'explain his motives.' One thing is certain, that prisoners for felony\r\n    in the year 1783 had not to submit to any arbitrary sumptuary\r\n    arrangement--at least in the Quebec _gaol_ (as it is always spelled in\r\n    the _Gazette_, perhaps because it is the goal of evildoers).\r\n\r\n    \"The general state of society in Montreal, as well as in Three Rivers,\r\n    St. Johns, L'Assomption, Terrebonne, Sorel and the other towns and\r\n    villages in existence at the period which we are considering was, in\r\n    all probability, very like that of Quebec--the last-mentioned place\r\n    having, of course, a certain prestige as the capital.\r\n\r\n    \"It would be futile to attempt to give an accurate picture of the\r\n    appearance of Montreal or Quebec at that distant date, and a\r\n    description pretending to accuracy would not be possible without the\r\n    collation of more ancient records than are easily obtainable by one\r\n    person. The names of some of the streets, as Notre Dame, St. Paul and\r\n    St. Antoine in Montreal, and St. John's, Fabrique, St. Peter and\r\n    others in Quebec, are still unchanged. Villages near these towns, such\r\n    as Ste. Foye, Beauport, Charlesbourg, Sault aux Récollets, St. Denis,\r\n    Ste. Thérèse, etc., are also frequently mentioned in the old\r\n    _Gazettes_. Detroit and Niagara were places of considerable\r\n    importance, and St. Johns, Chambly, Berthier, L'Assomption, L'Acadie\r\n    and other places were much more influential communities in comparison\r\n    with the population of the country than they are to-day. The\r\n    authorities at Quebec and Montreal were not wanting in endeavors to\r\n    keep these cities clean, to judge, at least, by the published\r\n    'regulations for the police.' Every householder was obliged to put the\r\n    Scotch proverbs in force, and keep clean and 'free from filth, mud,\r\n    dirt, rubbish straw or hay' one-half of the street opposite his own\r\n    house The 'cleanings' were to be deposited on the beach, as they still\r\n    are in portions of Montreal and Quebec which border on the river.\r\n    Treasure-trove in the shape of stray hogs could be kept by the finder\r\n    twenty-four hours after the event, if no claim had been made in the\r\n    meantime, and if the owner declared himself in person or through the\r\n    bellman, he had to pay 10s. before he could have his pork restored.\r\n    Five shillings was the penalty for a stray horse. The regulations for\r\n    vehicles, slaughter-houses, sidewalks, markets, etc., were equally\r\n    strict. Among other duties, the carters had to keep the markets clean.\r\n    The keepers of taverns, inns and coffee-houses had to light the\r\n    streets. Every one entering the town in a sleigh had to carry a shovel\r\n    with him for the purpose of levelling _cahots_ which interrupted\r\n    his progress, 'at any distance within three leagues of the town.' The\r\n    rates of cabs and ferry-boats are fixed with much precision. No carter\r\n    was allowed to plead a prior engagement, but was to go 'with the\r\n    person who first demanded him, under a penalty of twenty shillings.'\r\n    The rate of speed was also regulated, and boys were not allowed to\r\n    drive.\r\n\r\n    \"Constant reference is made to the walls and gates of Montreal as well\r\n    as Quebec, and there is reason to believe the smaller towns were\r\n    similarly fortified. Beyond the walls, however, there was a\r\n    considerable population, and many of the military officers, Government\r\n    officials and merchants had villas without the city. The area in\r\n    Montreal which lies between Craig, St. Antoine and Sherbrooke streets\r\n    was studded with country-houses with large gardens and orchards\r\n    attached. The seigneurs and other gentry had also fine, capacious\r\n    stone-built residences, which much enhanced the charm of the rural\r\n    scenery. Some of the estates of those days were of almost immense\r\n    extent. The Kings of France thought nothing of granting a whole\r\n    province, and, even in British times, there were gentlemen whose acres\r\n    would have superimposed an English county. The extraordinary donation\r\n    of James I. of a large portion of North America to Sir William\r\n    Alexander was not long since brought before the public by the claims\r\n    of his descendants. Large tracts of land were given away by Louis\r\n    XIII., Louis XIV. and other French kings, by Oliver Cromwell and the\r\n    Stuarts, and the same extravagant system of entailing unmanageable\r\n    wealth on companies and individuals was continued after the conquest.\r\n\r\n    \"It would be interesting to know what was the kind of literary fare on\r\n    which the intellect of Canada subsisted in those days. It cannot be\r\n    supposed that the people spent all their time in business and social\r\n    pleasure. There must have been readers as well as cariolers and\r\n    dancers, and the literature of England and France was by no means\r\n    scanty. Great writers on every subject have flourished since that\r\n    time, but some of the greatest that ever lived, some of those whose\r\n    productions are still read with the highest pleasure, were the\r\n    offspring of the two centuries which preceded the conquest. No one\r\n    will be surprised to find, then, that in the year 1783, a circulating\r\n    library in Quebec numbered nearly 2,000 volumes. Nor is the enquirer\r\n    left in the dark as to its probable contents. In the Quebec\r\n    _Gazette_ of the 4th of December, a list of books is given which\r\n    'remained unsold at M. Jacques Perrault's, very elegantly bound'--and\r\n    books were bound substantially as well as elegantly in those days. In\r\n    this list are found 'Johnson's Dictionary,' then regarded as one of\r\n    the wonders of the literary world, 'Chesterfield's Letters,' long the\r\n    _vade-mecum_ of every young gentleman beginning life, and which,\r\n    even in our own days (and perhaps still), were frequently bound along\r\n    with spelling and reading books, the 'Pilgrim's Progress', which it is\r\n    not necessary to characterize, Young's 'Night Thoughts,' the\r\n    'Spectator and 'Guardian,' Rapin's 'English History,' 'Cook's\r\n    Voyages,' Rousseau's 'Eloise,' 'Télémaque,' 'Histoire Chinoise,'\r\n    'Esprit des Croissades,' 'Lettres de Fernand Cortes,' 'Histoire\r\n    Ancienne' par Rollin, 'Grammaire Anglaise et Française,'\r\n    'Dictionnaire par l'Académie,' 'Dictionnaire de Commerce,' 'Dictionary\r\n    of the Arts and Sciences,' 'Smith's Housewife,' 'The Devil on Sticks,'\r\n    'Voltaire's Essay on Universal History,' 'Dictionnaire de Cuisine' and\r\n    several others on various subjects, 'Oeuvres de Rabelais,' 'American\r\n    Gazetteer,' etc. These, it will be remembered, had remained unsold,\r\n    but among the sold there must have been copies of the same.\r\n\r\n    \"It is, according to our notions of to-day, a meagre collection, but,\r\n    no doubt, many families possessed good libraries, brought with them\r\n    from over the sea, and the bookseller may not have kept a large stock\r\n    at one time. It was the custom for merchants to sell off all their\r\n    overlying goods before they went or sent to Europe for a\r\n    reinforcement.\r\n\r\n    \"The following books were advertised as 'missing:'--Langhorn's\r\n    Plutarch, 1st vol., Thomson's Works, 4th vol., Gordon's 'Universal\r\n    Accountant,' 1st vol.; and Gray's Hudibras, 2nd vol. For each one of\r\n    them there is offered a reward of _two dollars_! Reading was expensive\r\n    recreation in those times.\r\n\r\n    \"The reader, perhaps, has seen, or, it may be, possesses one of those\r\n    old libraries, of which the general public occasionally have a glimpse\r\n    at auction rooms, composed of standard authors, and beautifully and\r\n    solidly bound, which had adorned the studies of the fathers of our\r\n    country. They contain all that was best in the French and English\r\n    literature of the last century--history, poetry, divinity, _belles\r\n    lettres_, science and art. From these may be gathered what were the\r\n    tastes, the culture and the thought of the Canadians of the last\r\n    century.\r\n\r\n    \"Music and painting were cultivated--the former being, as now, a\r\n    necessary part of female education. Of a festival given by the young\r\n    ladies of a place called _La Côte_, near Quebec, in 1764, it is\r\n    promised in the programme that \"the orchestra and symphony will be\r\n    composed of instruments of all kinds.\" It may interest some ladies to\r\n    know that among the dances at the same entertainment are mentioned\r\n    'l'Harlequinade,' 'La Chinoise,' and 'La Matelote Hollandaise'--some\r\n    relation, perhaps, to the 'Sailor's Hornpipe.'\r\n\r\n    \"The settlement in Canada of the United Empire Loyalists, after the\r\n    peace of September, 1783, by which the independence of the revolted\r\n    colonies was recognized, must have had a considerable influence on\r\n    Canadian society, and more than atoned for sufferings inflicted on the\r\n    colony during the progress of the war. Repeated efforts had been made\r\n    by the Americans to engage the affections of the Canadians. Among\r\n    those whom Congress had appointed commissioners to treat with the\r\n    Canadian people on this subject was the renowned Dr. Benjamin\r\n    Franklin, whose visit to this country was not the most successful\r\n    portion of his career. Although in some instances there was a\r\n    manifestation of disaffection to the British Government, the great\r\n    bulk of the population remained unmistakably loyal. In the Quebec\r\n    _Gazette_ of October 23rd, 1783, is found the Act of Parliament\r\n    passed in favour of the Loyalists, in which the 25th day of March,\r\n    1784, is fixed as the limit of the period during which claims for\r\n    relief or compensation for the loss of property should be received.\r\n    How many availed themselves of the provisions of this act it is not\r\n    easy to say, but the whole number of persons dispossessed of their\r\n    estates and forced to seek another home in consequence of their\r\n    continued allegiance, is set down at from 25,000 to 30,000. Of these,\r\n    the great majority took up their abodes in the Canadas, New Brunswick\r\n    and Nova Scotia, while a few went to the West Indies, and others\r\n    returned to England. The biographies of some of these Loyalist\r\n    settlers in British North America would be full of interest and\r\n    instruction. But records of family movements and vicissitudes are very\r\n    rarely kept--most rarely in those cases in which adventures are most\r\n    frequent and the course of events most changeful. I have, however,\r\n    seen accounts of the early settlements in the Eastern Townships, P.\r\n    Q., and in different portions of Ontario, which were full of the\r\n    romance of faith, of courage, and of perseverance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ST. LOUIS HOTEL\r\n\r\nA sketch of this fashionable thoroughfare--St. Louis street--the\r\nheadquarters of the judiciary, barristers, politicians, etc., would be\r\nincomplete without a mention of the chief trysting-place of travellers and\r\ntourists for the last thirty years--the leading hostelry of Quebec. St.\r\nLouis Hotel is made up of two or more private dwellings joined together.\r\nThat on the corner of Haldimand and St. Louis streets formerly was owned\r\nas a residence by the late Edward Burroughs, Esq., P. S. C. Next to it\r\nstood, in 1837, Schluep's Hotel--the Globe Hotel--kept by a German, and\r\nwhere the military swells in 1837-8-9 and our jolly curlers used to have\r\n_recherché_ dinners or their frugal \"beef and greens\" and fixings. In\r\n1848, Mr. Burroughs' house was rented to one Robert Bambrick, who\r\nsubsequently opened a second-class hotel at the corner of Ste. Anne and\r\nGarden streets, on the spot on which the Queen's printer, the late Mr.\r\nGeorge Desbarats, built a stately office for the printing of the _Canada\r\nGazette_--subsequently sold on the removal of the Government to Ottawa\r\n--now the Russell House. The _Globe_ Hotel belonged to the late B. C.\r\nA. Gugy, Esq. It was purchased by the late Messrs Lelièvre & Angers,\r\nbarristers, connected with two or three adjacent tenements, and rented,\r\nabout 1852, to Messrs. Azro and Willis Russell (represented now by the\r\nRussell Hotel Company) for the St. Louis Hotel. Connected by a door\r\nthrough the wall with the Music Hall, it is a notable landmark in St.\r\nLouis street and an object of considerable interest to city cabmen as\r\nwell, during the season of tourists. Its dining saloon, on the second\r\nflow, has witnessed many bountiful repasts, to celebrate social, military,\r\npolitical or literary events, none better remembered than that of the 17th\r\nof November, 1880, when the _élite_ of Quebec crowded in unusual numbers--\r\nabout one hundred and eighty citizens, English and French--to do honour,\r\nby a public banquet, to the laureate of the French Academy, M. Louis\r\nHonoré Fréchette, [30] to celebrate his receiving in August last, in\r\nParis, from the _Académie Française_, the unprecedented distinction, for a\r\ncolonist, of the _Grand Prix Monthyon_ (2,000 livres) for the excellence\r\nof his poetry.\r\n\r\nSubjoined will be found the names of some of those present, also, extracts\r\nfrom a few of the addresses delivered. We regret much that want of space\r\nprecludes us from adding more of the eloquent speeches delivered, because\r\nthey throw light for English readers on the high degree of culture French\r\nliterature has attained at Quebec. All, we are sure, will rejoice with us\r\nthat, for the cause of letters, M. Fréchette was timely rescued from the\r\nquagmire of political warfare and hustings promises.\r\n\r\n    _THE FRÉCHETTE DINNER, NOVEMBER 17, 1880._\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. L. H. Fréchette, the laureate of the French Academy, was last\r\n    night the recipient of marks of honor and esteem, in the shape of a\r\n    magnificent banquet given him at the St. Louis Hotel, by the citizens\r\n    of Quebec and vicinity. The tables were laid in the large dining hall\r\n    of the St. Louis Hotel, which was handsomely decorated for the\r\n    occasion. The walls were partially covered with French and English\r\n    flags, and wreaths of evergreen surrounded all the windows. Behind the\r\n    Chairman, on a bracket, was an excellent bust of the Canadian poet,\r\n    having on either side paintings of scenes in Mr. Fréchette's drama,\r\n    'Papineau,' by Mr. E. W.

McLeod, Esq.,\r\n\r\n    \"That the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec has witnessed with\r\n    the highest satisfaction the literary honours conferred in August\r\n    last, by the _Académie Française_, on Monsieur Louis Honoré Fréchette,\r\n    for the poetical excellence of his two poems, 'Les Fleurs Boréales'\r\n    and 'Les Oiseaux de Neige.'\r\n\r\n    \"That the Academical crown, encircling the brow of a Canadian poet,\r\n    ought to be as much prised by Canada as it must be dear to its gifted\r\n    son, the Laureate of the French Academy.\r\n\r\n    \"That such a signal distinction conferred by the highest literary\r\n    tribunal, whilst it exhibits in such a favourable light the\r\n    intellectual vigour of the Province of Quebec, cannot be otherwise\r\n    than a subject of legitimate pride to the Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\n    \"That the President and Secretary of this Society be charged with the\r\n    pleasant duty of conveying to Monsieur L. H. Fréchette the expression\r\n    of the sentiments of admiration with which it views his literary\r\n    success.\r\n\r\n      (Signed,) J. M. LEMOINE, President\r\n      ALEX. ROBERTSON, Secretary\r\n\r\n      _Quebec_, 13th October, 1880.\r\n\r\n    \"The usual loyal toasts--the Queen and Governor-General--were given\r\n    by the Chairman, and enthusiastically honoured.\r\n\r\n    \"The Chairman then proposed \"France,\" the toast being received with\r\n    the usual honours and responded to by M. Lefaivre, the Consul-General\r\n    for France.\r\n\r\n    \"M. Lefaivre made an interesting speech, alluding to the past and\r\n    present of France, to the communication between the France of the Old\r\n    World and the _Nouvelle France_ of this Western hemisphere, dwelling\r\n    upon the honours achieved by the guest of the evening in Paris, and\r\n    contending that literature was the soul of a nation.\r\n\r\n    \"The Chairman, Hon. Mr. Justice H. Taschereau, then rose to propose\r\n    the toast of the evening, being received with loud and prolonged\r\n    cheering. He said,--\r\n\r\n    \"GENTLEMEN,--I have now the honour to propose the toast of the\r\n    evening--the health of our distinguished fellow-countryman, our guest,\r\n    Louis Honoré Fréchette, the poet of Canada, crowned by the Academy of\r\n    France. You have heard, gentlemen, the loud hurrah of all Canada in\r\n    honour of one of her children, and here, perhaps, I might cease\r\n    speaking. Nothing that I might say could increase the glad strength of\r\n    the general voice of the country, when the news arrived here that the\r\n    grand arena of literature, the French Academy, an institution whose\r\n    life is counted by centuries, and which is without equal in the world,\r\n    that great interpreter and infallible judge of the difficulties, the\r\n    beauties and the genius of the French language, had given one of its\r\n    annual prizes, and perhaps the finest of all--the prize of poetry--to\r\n    one of our countrymen. I could never fittingly express or depict the\r\n    sentiments of pride and joy felt by all lovers of literature in this\r\n    country--I may add of all good Canadians--when the news came from\r\n    beyond the ocean, from that sacred France, mother of civilization;\r\n    from fairy Paris, capital of the Muses, that Mr. Fréchette had been\r\n    crowned! But, as Chairman of this happy reunion, at the risk of but\r\n    faintly re-echoing the general sentiment, I must at least try to\r\n    express my feelings in proposing this toast. The emotions which I feel\r\n    are of a dual nature, that of friendship and of patriotism, and, as\r\n    friendship is nearer to the heart, so I gave that feeling the first\r\n    place. The speaker here referred to his collegiate days in the\r\n    Seminary of Quebec, where he met Mr. Fréchette, and in preparing\r\n    himself for the battle of life, had won the friendship of the Canadian\r\n    poet. He alluded to Mr. Fréchette's first efforts in verse, and had\r\n    judged his early attempts, and in referring to his (the Judge's) own\r\n    literary works at the time, the speaker said that the line of Boileau\r\n    might be applied to him,\r\n\r\n      \"'Pour lui, Phoebus est sourd et Pégase est rétif.'\r\n\r\n    \"At that time, Mr. Fréchette had not reached the heights of Helicon,\r\n    nor attained the regions wherein the 'Boreal Flowers' are gathered and\r\n    the 'Snow Birds' fly, but the little flowers he gathered in more\r\n    modest fields had around them the perfume of genuine poetry, and the\r\n    emerald, ruby and topaz of art already shone in the dainty plumage of\r\n    his summer birds. Mr. Fréchette published in a small journal in\r\n    manuscript, called _L'Echo_, of which Judge Taschereau was then\r\n    editor in the Seminary, the first efforts of his muse. This souvenir\r\n    of the past is now very precious to me, said the speaker, because it\r\n    enables me to state that I was the first editor of our poet's works.\r\n    Judge Taschereau further alluded to the time when, with Mr. Fréchette,\r\n    he studied law, that dry study, and though the poet was thus devoted\r\n    to the goddess Themis, he nevertheless found time to worship at the\r\n    shrine of song. How could the poet do otherwise? His fame had already\r\n    gone abroad. The journals of the country were already publishing his\r\n    sonnets, odes and songs. His acrostics were sought after to grace the\r\n    albums of fair ladies. Even the volunteers of Canada asked him for\r\n    war-songs, which are happily more frequently heard in drawing-rooms\r\n    than in camps. The young student did not possess himself. He was\r\n    already the property of the country, and the Institutes of Justinian\r\n    were put aside for the more pleasing task of framing idyllic pictures\r\n    of poetic genius. In fact, Crémazie was almost forgotten, and the name\r\n    of Fréchette was on every tongue. Mr. Taschereau tried to reclaim the\r\n    poet to his legal duties, and give him the place of Mr. Faucher de St.\r\n    Maurice in his office. Mr. Fréchette accepted the sinecure, but no\r\n    sooner had he done so than Mr. Faucher returned, anxious, no doubt,\r\n    for good and congenial company. Judge of my happiness, with Fréchette\r\n    and Faucher in my office, and I their humble patron. I thought I would\r\n    succeed in converting my friends, but in this I failed, for they led\r\n    me on their own paths until I myself began to versify, and, instead of\r\n    reading Pothier, read 'proofs' of verses. As it is, Mr. Fréchette did\r\n    become a lawyer; but Mr. Faucher abandoned the pursuit--he retired\r\n    from my office, lost forever to Themis, but safe to the cause of\r\n    literature. The departure of my young friends saved me. I could never\r\n    expect to win the applause of the French Academy, and thus, as I am\r\n    enabled to preside at this banquet, I may be permitted to offer our\r\n    guest a bouquet of friendship's flowers, gathered during twenty-five\r\n    years, and I feel that its perfume will be agreeable to my\r\n    distinguished friend. The life of Mr. Fréchette is written in the\r\n    poetry and literature of this country. He has marched steadily onward\r\n    from the day on which he wrote his _Loisirs_, until the grand\r\n    moment when he stood the crowned victor in the Academy of France. We\r\n    have known our guest as a lawyer, journalist and member of Parliament,\r\n    and have always admired his wonderful faculties, ever ready as he was\r\n    to promote the welfare of his friends. His large heart contributed to\r\n    pave the way to success, for, undoubted though his talents are, his\r\n    winning manners won for him an ever-growing popularity, and we may\r\n    affirm that, if he had traducers, he had, on the other hand, a host of\r\n    friends. Traducers always follow the wake of a literary man, and they\r\n    resemble the creeping things which we suffer in our gardens, because\r\n    their existence can lead to no effectual harm. I may have occupied\r\n    your time at too great length in treating of Mr. Fréchette as a\r\n    friend. Allow me now, however, for a few moments, to speak of his\r\n    success from a patriotic point of view. As French-Canadians, we are\r\n    proud of our Laureate, and happy to see him in our midst this evening.\r\n    In crowning our distinguished poet, the French Academy has given a\r\n    splendid recognition to Canadian literature in the great Republic of\r\n    Letters. Our Laureate is a French-Canadian, but our fellow-citizens of\r\n    British origin have joined with us in this manifestation of our joy,\r\n    and through their press, as at such gatherings as this, they have\r\n    spontaneously recognized his talent, thus showing their spirit of\r\n    justice and their enlightened patriotism. Party politics have ceased\r\n    their discordant cries to join unanimously in honoring our Laureate,\r\n    and this is a spectacle of consolation to the country. No commentary\r\n    is required on this expression of our joy. It is, in itself, the most\r\n    eloquent of proofs that the citizens of Quebec, as well as those of\r\n    Montreal, in giving this festival to Mr. Fréchette, have invited all\r\n    Canadians, in the largest acceptation of the word, to do him honour.\r\n    In concluding, as I know you are anxious to hear him address you this\r\n    evening, permit me to make a comparison. One of the most distinguished\r\n    of modern poets, Alfred de Musset, said in a moment of despair:--\r\n\r\n      \"J'ai perdu ma force, et ma vie,\r\n      Et mes amis, et ma gaîté:\r\n      J'ai perdu jusqu'à la fierté\r\n      Qui faisait croire à mon génie.\"\r\n\r\n    \"'I have lost my strength and my life, my friends and my gayety,\r\n    almost my very pride, which made me believe in my genius.' We may say\r\n    to Mr. Fréchette, as an offset to this cry of despair from one of his\r\n    elder poetic brethren: 'Courage! You have strength and life! More\r\n    friends than ever! An enthusiasm of gayety which is fathomless! March\r\n    on and sing! We are proud of you, and we believe in your genius,\r\n    crowned, as it is, by the highest literary tribunal in the world--that\r\n    of the Forty Immortals!' (Cheers.)\r\n\r\n    \"The utmost enthusiasm pervaded those present, and when the poet\r\n    laureate rose to reply, he was greeted with loud applause, which\r\n    continued for several minutes. Mr. Fréchette said:--\r\n\r\n    \"MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN,--For some time past I have abstained from\r\n    public speaking, and there are those amongst my best friends who tell\r\n    me that I have done well. To-day Montreal [31] and Quebec seem to have\r\n    conspired against me, to oblige me to make two speeches on the same\r\n    subject. This, though flattering to me, is hardly fair. If, having\r\n    pleaded in one sense, I were asked to take the opposite ground, it\r\n    might appear that such would not embarrass a lawyer, and one who has\r\n    also been a politician, but in my present position I am called upon to\r\n    treat the same question twice, and absolutely in the same sense. How\r\n    can I discover something new to advance. Naturally, I felt embarrassed\r\n    at the outset, but, at any risk, my duty is to respond to your\r\n    flattering call, and thus to best avenge myself upon this conspiracy\r\n    of my friends. It will not be surprising if I affirm that the occasion\r\n    of this reunion has for me a character of especial solemnity. Seated\r\n    at this festive board, I see the representatives of different nations,\r\n    who, in private capacities also, have won general respect. I see,\r\n    also, my fellow-citizens of Quebec and of Levis, my native town--the\r\n    schoolmates of my earliest days--_confrères_ in professional\r\n    life and in the walks of literature--comrades of past political\r\n    struggles--friends, ever indulgent and generous--political leaders of\r\n    whom I have always been proud, and gentlemen of various origins,\r\n    divergent opinions and different religious beliefs, all tendering me\r\n    their warmest congratulations upon the success I have achieved in the\r\n    literary world. No words of mine are adequate to express my feelings,\r\n    not can I sufficiently thank you all for this spontaneous and\r\n    sympathetic demonstration in honour of one who regrets that he is not\r\n    more worthy of your favour. I can only accept your evidences of\r\n    friendship with cordial emotion, thank you from the depth of my heart\r\n    and bear with me from this hall a proud memory which will unite with\r\n    the remembrances of my youth, all of which are so intimately\r\n    identified with the hospitable people of Quebec, and, in so declaring,\r\n    I am but assuring you that this remembrance will ever attend upon me.\r\n    The past vouches for this; for when my tent of exile shook in the\r\n    winds from off the great Western lakes, or slept on the bowery shores\r\n    of Louisianian streams; when my traveller's skiff was rocked on the\r\n    waters of the Southern gulfs, or was reflected on the blue waves of\r\n    the Loire; when I had before me the wild majesty of Niagara, the\r\n    immensity of the ocean, or when, filled with admiration, I paused to\r\n    gaze upon the stupendous monuments of the Old World, my thoughts ever\r\n    instinctively flew back to the good old city of Champlain,\r\n    unparalleled in the world for the picturesque splendor of its site,\r\n    and the poetry which no less issues from the very stones of its\r\n    fortress, than it lingers upon every page of its history. Yes! Old\r\n    Quebec! In all places I have cherished with devotion every memory of\r\n    you, for within your walls my heart first opened to the noble teaching\r\n    of intellect! It is your lofty embrasures--your flag, bravely floating\r\n    in the skies--your abrupt rock, your stretches of ramparts, your\r\n    brilliant steeples, reflecting their beauty on the bosom of the St.\r\n    Lawrence, mingled with the sails of your cosmopolitan navies; which,\r\n    for the first time, awoke the poetic enthusiasm in my breast. Long ago\r\n    I first saw these scenes from the window of an humble cottage of\r\n    Levis, half-hidden in a screen of foliage; and in my youngest days,\r\n    ere I knew the method or formation of a verse, I felt the fluttering\r\n    against the cage of my heart of that golden bird, whose sonorous voice\r\n    is styled Poetry. In fact, gentlemen, I was carried towards a literary\r\n    career from the very outset, and in this connection you will permit me\r\n    to relate a little anecdote. You will pardon me if I appear\r\n    egotistical, but your cordial reception warrants me in looking for\r\n    your indulgence. I had learned to read in a book full of reveries and\r\n    sentiment, entitled 'Letters or the poet Gilbert to his sister.' Of\r\n    course I understood but little of it, yet it made a deep impression on\r\n    my imagination. One day my father, an honest man and good citizen, if\r\n    there were ever any such, but who had nothing in common with the\r\n    Muses, asked my brother and I what professions we would adopt when we\r\n    grew big. 'For me,' replied my happy-hearted brother Edmond, 'I will\r\n    be a carter,' and 'I will be a poet,' I immediately added. I still\r\n    remember my father's smile of affectionate pity when he heard these\r\n    unexpected declarations from the hopes of his declining years. \"My\r\n    poor children,\" said he, with a resigned air, \"these two occupations\r\n    will never lead you to wealth and fortune.\" Later I understood the\r\n    wise reflection of my father, but no one carves out his own destiny\r\n    and he must submit to fate. I have vainly tried other careers but\r\n    finally was obliged to return to this dream of my infancy. As the poet\r\n    says,\r\n\r\n      \"Drive away the natural, and it returns at full speed.\"\r\n\r\n    Yes, dear old City of Quebec, so old and so glorious, so beautiful in\r\n    your _ensemble_ and so characteristic in your details, so cordial\r\n    and so hospitable, in presence of your noblest children assembled here\r\n    to welcome me, within your old walls, let me give this testimony, that\r\n    if I have had the happiness of causing the Canadian name to be heard\r\n    in the immortal shrine of French literature it is to you I owe it, and\r\n    to you is my gratitude offered. For I must tell you, gentlemen, that I\r\n    loved Quebec too much, at the distance, not to hasten across the\r\n    river, when the bird felt that his wings were strong enough to fly. At\r\n    that time the greatest of the poets of Quebec, Octave Crémazie, sang\r\n    the glories of our ancestors and the brave deeds of old France. His\r\n    energetic and inspired voice excited youthful emulation. A group of\r\n    budding writers surrounded him, but each one felt timid and hesitated\r\n    to tune his notes amongst the loud echoes of his vigorous patriotism.\r\n    Alas! the star fled from our skies, another generation of enthusiastic\r\n    poets and writers disputed the honour of seizing the lyre, so heavy\r\n    for their fingers, which had been left on the rock of Quebec, by the\r\n    author of the Flag of Carillon. O! my old comrades, do you think as\r\n    frequently as do I, of those old days, when with hearts full of poetic\r\n    illusions, we united our talents, our hopes and I might add our\r\n    poverty, to establish that spiritual association in which the\r\n    beautiful was idolized, seekers as we were after the ideal, dealers in\r\n    mental _bijouterie_, despised at first by some, but which\r\n    succeeded more than once in directing the attention of literary France\r\n    to our shores? Do you, at times, remember our joyful meetings, our\r\n    interminable readings, our long hours of continued study and waking\r\n    reveries in common--do you yet remember the bewildering evenings in\r\n    which the glass of Henri Murger mingled its sonorous tinklings, bright\r\n    and merry, to the love-song of our flowery youth? We were all rivals,\r\n    but\r\n\r\n      \"Our hearts, as our lute, vibrated as one,\"\r\n\r\n    and God knows that this rivalry never severed the bonds of affection\r\n    which united us, and so was founded what has since been styled the\r\n    Mutual Admiration Society. Mutual Admiration Society! If we were to\r\n    consider the number of books, dress-coats, gloves and other articles\r\n    of more intimate character that were exchanged between us, it might\r\n    more safely have been called the Society for Mutual Support. At all\r\n    events, from the spectacle before me this evening I gather that this\r\n    Society of Mutual Admiration, if admiration it must be termed, has\r\n    taken a singular development since I had the honour of assisting so\r\n    frequently at its meetings, and there is nothing surprising in this,\r\n    since one of the most distinguished of the founders of this society,\r\n    Mr. Faucher de St. Maurice, informed me the other day that the society\r\n    in question was about to annex the French Academy. (Laughter.) But to\r\n    be serious, allow me to recount another anecdote. There was a time,\r\n    gentlemen, when our Mutual Admiration was far from being so ambitious\r\n    as to dream of having a _succursale_ under the rotunda of the\r\n    French Institute. But if our productions were meagre, our revenues\r\n    were still more so, and famine often reigned in the chests of the\r\n    confraternity. However we had our own days of abundance when there was\r\n    corn in Egypt. The first Quebecer who understood that poetry, unlike\r\n    perpetual motion, could not feed itself, was a brewer, whose memory is\r\n    now legendary and who was known by the harmonious name of McCallum.\r\n    Arthur Casgrain, who in a couple of years afterwards we sorrowfully\r\n    bore to the cemetery, had thought of composing an Epic on the Grand\r\n    Trunk. This was called \"La grande Tronciade!\" Well in one of the\r\n    twelve parts of this production, so very original, there were three\r\n    remarkable lines.\r\n\r\n      \"Buvons, buvons, amis, de ce bon maccallome,\r\n      Venant directement du brasseur qu'il dénome!\r\n      C'est ça qui vous retape et vous refait un homme?\"\r\n\r\n    The effect was magical. The heart of the brewer was touched. A long\r\n    waggon on which we could read the eloquent words \"pale ale and porter\"\r\n    stopped next day before our door. For twenty minutes a man with\r\n    burthened step climbed the Jacob's ladder which led to the poet's\r\n    attic, and one hundred and forty-four bottles of inviting appearance\r\n    ranged themselves around the chamber. I cannot picture the joy of the\r\n    happy recipient. In his enthusiasm he offered me a community in his\r\n    good fortune--of course under a pledge of inviolable secrecy. But as I\r\n    felt the imperious necessity of communicating my emotions I was as\r\n    wanting in discretion as he had been, and that evening all the\r\n    Bohemians, students and literary friends even to the remotest degree\r\n    followed in the wake of McCallum's bottles, and invaded the attic\r\n    chamber of poor Arthur (your good-natured cousin, Mr. President.)\r\n    There we had French, English, Latin and Greek speeches in prose and in\r\n    verse. Arsène Michaud has even prepared a story for the occasion. In\r\n    brief, the hecatomb was made; the libation was Olympic, the twelve\r\n    dozen disappeared and on the morrow poor Casgrain showed me with a sad\r\n    face the Homeric remains of his one day's wealth, and in a lamentable\r\n    tone of despair he exclaimed: \"I will have to write another poem.\"\r\n    Gentlemen, that was the first time in Canada that poetry made a return\r\n    to its author, and in tasting these delicate viands which the\r\n    hospitable city of Quebec now offers to one of those early Bohemians\r\n    in recognition of his literary success, I could not fail to recollect\r\n    with emotion this amusing circumstance now enveloped, with other\r\n    scenes of youth, sometimes glad--sometimes sorrowful, in the shadowy\r\n    robe of past recollections. Another story just suggests itself to my\r\n    mind. Lusignan and I occupied the attic of an old house in Palace\r\n    street. Our room was heated by a stove-pipe, which reached from the\r\n    lower apartments. One day I had published in _Le Canadien_--_Tempora\r\n    Mutantur_--a little poem in which was the following line:\r\n\r\n      \"Shivering in my attic poor.\"\r\n\r\n    The next day a surprise awaited us. A dumb stove had replaced the mere\r\n    stove-pipe, and while holding our sides from laughter we heard this\r\n    speech: \"Gentlemen, we are very indulgent, considering your noisy\r\n    meetings--we are not very particular when rent-day arrives--and if you\r\n    _so shivered_ in your room, it would have been better to have\r\n    said so privately, than to have complained of it in the newspapers.\"\r\n    (Laughter.) Poor Mrs. Tessier, our landlady--she was not well\r\n    acquainted with figures of speech, but she has been the Providence of\r\n    many of the destitute, and more than one who hears me now can say as I\r\n    do, that no better or more obliging heart ever beat in a more pitiful\r\n    bosom towards purseless youth. And who knows, it is perhaps due to\r\n    this sympathetic feeling of its population towards literary men and\r\n    writers that this city of Quebec has seen such an array of talent\r\n    within her bosom, such a succession of Pleiades of distinguished\r\n    litterateurs, who have glorified her name and that of their country.\r\n    For the last fifty years, men eminent in all branches of literature\r\n    have made a gorgeous and resplendent aureole around the city of\r\n    Quebec. In the generation immediately preceding us, we see Petitclerc,\r\n    Parent, Soulard, Chauveau, Garneau, L'Ecuyer, Ferland, Barthe and Réal\r\n    Angers, these grand pioneers of intellect, who in history, poetry,\r\n    drama and romance, made such a wide opening for the generation which\r\n    followed them. Then we have l'Abbé Laverdière, l'Abbé Casgrain,\r\n    LeMoine, Fiset, Taché, Plamondon, LaRue, and the first among all\r\n    Octave Crémazie, who coming at different times bravely and constantly\r\n    continued the labours of their predecessors, until we reach the\r\n    brilliant phalanx of contemporary writers, Lemay, Fabre, l'Abbé Begin,\r\n    Routhier, Oscar Dunn, Faucher de St. Maurice, Buies, Marmette and\r\n    Legendre, all charged with the glorious task of preserving for Quebec\r\n    her legitimate title of the Athens of Canada. And how could it be\r\n    otherwise? Is not Quebec the cradle of our nationality--the spot\r\n    whereon is engraved the most illustrious pages of our history--heroic\r\n    annals, touching souvenirs, all combining with the marvels of nature\r\n    to speak here the soul of the historian and of the poet. What a\r\n    flourishing field for the historian and poet is not the tale of that\r\n    handful of Breton heroes, who, three centuries ago, planted on the\r\n    rock of Quebec the flag of Christianity and civilization! What\r\n    innumerable sources of inspiration can we not find in our majestic\r\n    river, our gigantic lakes, our grand cascades, our lofty mountains,\r\n    our impenetrable forests and in all that grand and wild nature, which\r\n    will ever be the characteristic feature of our dear Canada. Oh! our\r\n    history, gentlemen! Oh, the picturesque beauties of our country! Two\r\n    marvellous veins--two mines of precious material open at our feet. The\r\n    European writers are ever striving to discover something fresh. Having\r\n    exhausted all kinds of themes, they are now stooping to the dust to\r\n    find an originality which seems to fly from them. Well, this\r\n    freshness, this originality, so courted and so rare now-a-days, may be\r\n    found within our grasp,--it is there in our historical archives--in\r\n    our patriarchal customs--in the many characters of a people young and\r\n    thirsting for independence--a robust and healthy poetry, floats on our\r\n    breezes--breathes in our popular songs--sings in the echoes of our\r\n    wild forests, and opens graceful and proud her white wings to the\r\n    winds of the free aspirations of the new world. To us this virgin\r\n    field belongs, gentlemen! Take from Europe her form and experience,\r\n    but leave to her, her old Muses. Let us be true to ourselves! Be\r\n    Canadians and the future is ours. \"That which strikes us most in your\r\n    poems\" said a member of the French Academy to me, \"is that the modern\r\n    style, the Parisian style of your verses is united to something\r\n    strange, so particular and singular--it seems an exotic, disengaged\r\n    from the entire.\" This perfume of originality which this writer\r\n    discovered in my writings was then unknown to myself. What was it? It\r\n    was the secret of their nationality,--the certificate of their origin,\r\n    their Canadian stamp! And it is important for us, gentlemen, never to\r\n    allow this character to disappear. Let our young writers stamp it\r\n    broadly on their pages and then advance to their task, they need no\r\n    longer fear the thorns on the way. The path is wide open and millions\r\n    of readers await their efforts. To the work then; France offers us her\r\n    hand, and now that we have renewed the bonds between us and our\r\n    illustrious and well-beloved mother country--bonds broken by the\r\n    vicissitudes which occur in the life of peoples, we shall be enabled\r\n    once more to prove the great truth enunciated by Bulwer Lytton in\r\n    \"_Richelieu_,\" that\r\n\r\n      \"The pen is mightier than the sword.\"\r\n\r\n    The Chairman called upon Hon. Wilfred Laurier to propose the next\r\n    toast.\r\n\r\n    Hon. Mr. Laurier, on being called on to propose the toast of the\r\n    Academy of France, was loudly cheered on rising, and the enthusiasm\r\n    became the greater as he advanced, showing the many claims the great\r\n    French tribunal of letters had upon the attention of the learned word.\r\n    He spoke of the old ties which bound France and Canada, and alluded to\r\n    the argument of Doucet, the French Academician, in favour of the\r\n    admission of Fréchette to the French _concours_, viz., that when\r\n    France was in the throes of agony, the voice of French Canada spoke\r\n    out its loud attachment to the cause of the ancient mother country. In\r\n    such action was the forgotten daughter restored to its sorrowing\r\n    mother. The hon. gentleman then in language of forcible eloquence\r\n    referred to the pleasure shown by English-Canadians at the success of\r\n    Mr. Fréchette, and concluded a highly intellectual and eloquent\r\n    speech, amidst the reiterated cheers of the whole assemblage.\r\n\r\n    The Chairman then proposed the toast of English and French literature.\r\n\r\n    Mr. George Stewart, jr., who on rising was greeted with cheers,\r\n    said:--\r\n\r\n    MR. CHAIRMAN AND GENTLEMEN:--I must thank you for the very\r\n    enthusiastic manner in which you have just drank to this toast, and\r\n    for the cordiality with which you have been good enough to receive my\r\n    name. Before asking you to consider with me the subject which has just\r\n    been so happily proposed from the chair, I would ask your permission\r\n    to say how gratified I am at being present, this evening, to assist\r\n    you in paying homage to one whom we all delight to honour, and at\r\n    whose feet it is our special privilege to sit. (Cheers.) It is all of\r\n    seventeen years since Mr. Fréchette gave to the public, in a little\r\n    book, the best fruits of his youthful muse, but those early efforts of\r\n    his mind gave abundant promise of future excellence and hope,--a\r\n    promise which has since been admirably and delightfully fulfilled. I\r\n    cannot tell you how proud we all feel,--we who speak the English\r\n    tongue, alike with you who utter the liquid and mellow language of\r\n    Béranger and De Musset,--that the \"Forty Immortals\" of Mother France,\r\n    recognized in Mr. Fréchette,--what all of us knew before,--that he was\r\n    a tender and graceful poet, and that his work is as pure and sweet as\r\n    anything to be found in the lyric poetry of our time. (Cheers.) Mr.\r\n    Fréchette had not to go abroad to find that out, but it is pleasing to\r\n    us all to find our opinions confirmed and ratified by the highest\r\n    authority in France. I again thank you, gentlemen, for the privilege\r\n    which you have afforded me of saying these few words regarding our\r\n    laurel-crowned poet and guest. (Applause.) With regard to the subject\r\n    which has brought me to my feet, what am I to say? I might dilate upon\r\n    the beauties of Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales_, or Edmund Spenser's\r\n    immortal _Faerie Queene_, or Shakespeare's tender women, the\r\n    _Juliet_ we love, the Rosalind who is ever in our hearts, the\r\n    Beatrice, the Imogen, gentle Ophelia, or kindly but ill-starred\r\n    Desdemona, or the great heroes of tragedy, Lear, Macbeth, Hamlet or\r\n    Othello, or I might ask you to hear a word about Ben Jonson, \"rare\r\n    Ben,\" or poor Philip Massinger who died a stranger, of the Puritan\r\n    Milton, the great Catholic Dryden, or Swift, or Bunyan, Defoe,\r\n    Addison, Pope and Burke and grim Sam Johnson who made the dictionary\r\n    and wrote Rasselas, the Prince of Abyssinia, but there is not time for\r\n    us to go into the subject as minutely as that. At a dinner of this\r\n    kind, which is so rich in every delicacy which the most sensitive\r\n    palate could desire, and which boasts wines as delicate and as\r\n    fragrant in bouquet as one of Mr. Fréchette's sonnets--(Cheers)--and I\r\n    might add also as one of my friend LeMay's hopefullest lyrics--\r\n    (Cheers), it would be ungenerous of me to keep you very long. I will\r\n    content myself therefore with a remark or two regarding the peculiar\r\n    features which seem to inspire our literature, at the present time,\r\n    and by our literature I mean English literature in its broadest sense\r\n    and amplest significance. Perhaps at no period of letters, in the\r\n    whole history of literature from the days of Chaucer and Raleigh, from\r\n    the renaissance, through the classic period, to more modern times, to\r\n    our own day in fact, has the cultured world seen such a brilliant\r\n    array of brilliant men and women, who write the English prose which\r\n    delights our fire-sides, and enriches our minds at the present time.\r\n    The world has never presented to mankind before, in all its years of\r\n    usefulness, such a galaxy of great essayists and novelists as we have\r\n    enjoyed and enjoy now, within a period of fifty or sixty years, and\r\n    which properly belong to our own age. The era is rich in stalwart\r\n    minds, in magnificent thinkers, in splendid souls. Carlyle, Emerson,\r\n    Wilson, Morley, Froude, Holmes, Harrison, Darwin, Huxley, Spencer,\r\n    Mill, Buckle, Lewes. In fiction the list is too long for mention, but,\r\n    in passing, I may note George Eliot--a woman who writes as if her soul\r\n    had wings, William Black who paints almost as deftly as Walter Scott,\r\n    Thomas Hardy, Anthony Trollope, Thackeray, Dickens, Reade, William\r\n    Howells, who has not forgotten to write of the grandeur of the\r\n    Saguenay, and William Kirby whose _Chien d'Or_ will serve to keep\r\n    a memory green in many a Quebecer's heart. I need hardly name more.\r\n    The list could, I am well aware, be extended indefinitely, and as each\r\n    of you doubtless has your favourite novelist, I need not waste your\r\n    time by the simple enumeration of men and women who have from time to\r\n    time, beguiled away the hours with their stories of the heart, or of\r\n    purpose, or of endeavour. We get _blasé_ now and then perhaps\r\n    through the reading of so many moderns, but the cure for that lies\r\n    within easy range. We can take a peep at those old fellows in old-\r\n    fashioned bindings, who used to delight our grandfathers in the \"brave\r\n    days of old,\" when Richardson told the story of \"Pamela,\" and\r\n    \"Clarissa Harlowe,\" when Fielding wrote \"Tom Jones,\" and Smollett\r\n    narrated the history of \"Humphrey Clinker,\" and the career of\r\n    \"Tristram Shandy\" found a truthful historian in that mad parson\r\n    Lawrence Sterne. We might even read those ancient authors, ancient in\r\n    style at least, for a change, and still be reading English literature\r\n    in its truest and widest sense. But it is less with the fiction-\r\n    writers that we have to deal, than with the thinkers who have given to\r\n    _belles-lettres_ in this age, its robustness and vigour. In\r\n    political economy, in scientific thought, in history, in moral\r\n    philosophy and in polite learning, and in criticism, I think our day\r\n    has produced the greatest teachers, as well as the largest number of\r\n    them since the English tongue had a literature of its own. (Applause.)\r\n    This is true at least in prose writing. I know that in poetry we are\r\n    surpassed in grandeur and majesty by the bards of other periods of our\r\n    mental activity, I know that we have not produced a Milton yet, nor a\r\n    Dryden, nor a Pope--I leave Shakespeare and Chaucer out of the\r\n    question, nor a Spenser. We have very many more than our share of\r\n    really tuneful singers and fine poets like Tennyson and Longfellow,\r\n    Morris and Swinburne, the Arnolds and Lowell--all of them sweet and in\r\n    every way charming, none of them grand and magnificent like the sons\r\n    of song of the great days of poesy. We have singers and singers, minor\r\n    poets and minor poets, all engaged in weaving for our delight very\r\n    many pretty fancies; graceful story-tellers in verse, if you will, but\r\n    our chief strength lies in prose, sober, scholarly and healthful\r\n    prose. Our fame will rest on that branch of the service. (Applause.)\r\n    Turning to Canada, I might say that our mental outfit is by no means\r\n    beggarly. In fiction we have produced, and I confine myself\r\n    particularly to those who have written in English, Judge Haliburton,\r\n    James DeMille, Wm. Kirby, John Lesperance. (Applause.) In poetry,\r\n    Heavysege, John Reade, Roberts, Charles Sangster, Wm. Murdoch,\r\n    Chandler, Howe; in history, Beamish Murdoch, Todd, Morgan, Hannay, Mr.\r\n    LeMoine--(Applause)--whom I see present here to night; Dr. Miles, Mr.\r\n    Harper, the efficient Rector of our High School, and others of more or\r\n    less repute. In Science, Dr. Dawson and Sir Wm. Logan; in logic, Wm.\r\n    Lyall; in rhetoric, James DeMille. In political and essay writing we\r\n    have a good list, the most prominent names being Goldwin Smith, whom\r\n    we may fairly claim, Bourinot, Haliburton, Todd, Howe, Elder, Ellis,\r\n    Griffin, Anglin, Dymond, McDougall, White. (Cheers.) And here I would\r\n    just say to you--for I have spoken longer than I intended--over-taxed\r\n    your patience I fear very much--that we must, if we would ever become\r\n    great in helping to form current thought and the intellectual movement\r\n    of the day, renounce all sectionalism in letters, and go in for the\r\n    great goal which all may aspire to who wish. When the French Academy\r\n    hailed our friend Fréchette as a brother poet, the act was not done\r\n    because he was a Canadian, but because he was a poet, writing and\r\n    speaking the French tongue. (Applause.) There is no such thing really\r\n    as Canadian literature or American literature. It is all English\r\n    literature, and we should all strive to add to the glory of that\r\n    literature. We can do it, in our way, as well as Moore and Lover and\r\n    Lever and Carleton and McGee did, when they added the splendid work of\r\n    their genius to build up the renown and prestige of the parent stock.\r\n    (Applause.) As Scott and Burns, Dunbar and Hector McNeill, and\r\n    Tannahill and James Hogg and bluff \"Kit North;\" all of Scotland, did\r\n    to make the English literature massive and spirited and grand.\r\n    (Applause.) As Hawthorne and Longfellow, Holmes and Bryant, Cooper and\r\n    Irving, and Motley did, and as our own John Reade (cheers) and Charles\r\n    Roberts, a new poet whose star has just arisen, and Bourinot--\r\n    (cheers)--and the rest of them are doing now. We must forget the small\r\n    localism which can do us no good, and join the great brotherhood of\r\n    letters which writes the world over, in the English tongue. France,\r\n    Germany and Russia, Italy and Spain teem with the grand work of their\r\n    children. We who speak and write in the English language must not be\r\n    unmindful of our several duties. We must work for the attainment of\r\n    the great end, the development of English literature, of which we are\r\n    as truly a part as the authors of the United States, of Scotland, of\r\n    Ireland and of England. English literature does not mean simply a\r\n    literature written solely by Englishmen. It takes its name from the\r\n    fact that it draws its nourishment from all writers who write in\r\n    English, and Scotchmen, Irishmen, Americans, and colonists, as well as\r\n    citizens of England are invited to add to its greatness and\r\n    permanency. I thank you Mr. Chairman and you gentlemen for your\r\n    kindness and forbearance in listening to me so long, and so patiently.\r\n    (Loud continued cheering.)\r\n\r\n    Mr. Lemay, in replying for French literature, said--It is particularly\r\n    agreeable to be called on to speak on this occasion because it affords\r\n    me the opportunity to render to our host an evidence of the admiration\r\n    and friendship which I bear towards him this evening. It is now over\r\n    twenty years since we were together at College, and the same tastes\r\n    which pleased us then govern us now. The same destiny which led us\r\n    towards the bar guided us also on the paths of literature. The speaker\r\n    here improvised a magnificent address to the genius of French-Canadian\r\n    letters. He alluded to the first pages of Canadian history written in\r\n    the blood of martyrs, thus giving to the Canadian people a literature\r\n    of heroes. The speaker then traced the changeful epochs from the days\r\n    of the soldiers of the sword to the warriors of the pen, and he drew\r\n    forth loud applause as he alluded to the brave polemists who traced\r\n    their literary endeavors in the brave work of defending their country\r\n    and redeeming its liberties. In quoting Sir Geo. Cartier's well known\r\n    line, \"O Canada, my country and my love,\" (\"O Canada, mon pays, mes\r\n    amours,\") the eloquent orator elicited the warm and hearty applause of\r\n    the assemblage. From the troublous days of 1837 to the present moment,\r\n    Mr. Lemay reviewed the various efforts at literary renown of the\r\n    French Canadian people, and concluded one of the finest speeches of\r\n    the evening amidst the tumultuous applause of his sympathising\r\n    auditors.\r\n\r\n    The next toast was that of the Literary and Historical Society and of\r\n    the _Institut Canadien_ of Quebec.\r\n\r\n    Mr. J. M. LeMoine, in replying to the first part of the toast said:--\r\n\r\n    GENTLEMEN,--In the name of the Literary and Historical Society of\r\n    Quebec, I thank you cordially for the health just proposed--As the\r\n    President of a society numbering close on 400 members, who though\r\n    diverse in creed and language, are united for one common object--the\r\n    promotion of culture and science and the encouragement of historical\r\n    studies,--I cannot help feeling I stand here somehow in the character\r\n    of a representative man. In tendering a welcome to Mr. Fréchette, our\r\n    honoured guest, I can add but little to the sentiments conveyed in the\r\n    resolution adopted at our last meeting and which you have heard read.\r\n    In presence of so many distinguished persons, several of whom have\r\n    made their mark, at the Bar--or on the Bench--the forum--in\r\n    literature--in the bank parlor or in the counting house,--with so many\r\n    fluent speakers here present and prepared to applaud, with all the\r\n    graces of oratory and fervour of patriotism,--the distinction\r\n    conferred on French Canada, by the highest literary tribunal in\r\n    France--convinced myself of the honour which Mr. Fréchette's laurels\r\n    must confer on this ancient and picturesque Province of Quebec, with\r\n    its glorious though yet unrevealed destinies, I feel proud as a\r\n    Canadian in standing here, the bearer even of a solitary rosebud for\r\n    the fragrant _bouquet_, which a grateful country offers this\r\n    night to its gifted child. Alas! had not the relentless hand [32] of\r\n    death--had not a self-imposed fate, darker even than death, removed\r\n    from our midst, another \"mind pregnant with celestial fire,\" Canada\r\n    this night might possibly have counted two laurel-crowned poets--Louis\r\n    Honoré Fréchette and Octave Crémazie. For I am not one of those who\r\n    refuse to recognize Canadian talent; on the contrary, I feel myself\r\n    moved to rejoice in our wealth of intellect. I am reminded to be\r\n    brief; around me there is a surging stream of eloquence ready to burst\r\n    through its floodgates. I must give way. With your permission, I shall\r\n    therefore merely ask a question. What propitious turn of fortune?\r\n    which of the benign fairies who watched over his natal hour has Mr.\r\n    Fréchette to thank for his present success? How came it to pass that,\r\n    though he was born a poet, he should have to undergo an ordeal like\r\n    another great poet (whom posterity may specially claim as an\r\n    historian) the author of the \"Lays of Ancient Rome,\" of emancipating\r\n    himself from his earthy--at one time not burdensome--thraldom before\r\n    soaring on the wings of poesy to that lofty region, where his classic\r\n    diction and lyric power attracted the attention of those worthy but\r\n    fastidious gentlemen, yclept \"The Forty Immortals of the French\r\n    Academy.\" I have mentioned a very illustrious name in the Republic of\r\n    Letters,--a name as dear to Britain as that of our Laureate ought to\r\n    be to Canada--that of Macaulay--historian, essayist, poet. You all\r\n    know how his parliamentary defeat as candidate for Edinburgh in 1847,\r\n    rescued him forever from the \"dismal swamp\" of politics, providing his\r\n    wondrous mind, with leisure to expand and mature, in the green fields\r\n    of literature. If New France has not yet produced such a gorgeous\r\n    genius as he, of whom all those who speak Chatham's tongue are so\r\n    justly proud, it has however out of its sparse population of one\r\n    million, put forth a representative whom Old France with its thirty-\r\n    eight millions has deemed a fit subject to honour in an unmistakable\r\n    way. Shall I tell you how, figuratively, if you should prefer, ended\r\n    for Fréchette the \"day of tumult\"?\r\n\r\n    That _Ignis Fatuus_, ambition, has allured, as you are aware,\r\n    more than one youthful fowler to an uncertain swampy hunting ground,\r\n    called \"politics.\" Mr. Fréchette was one of the unfortunate. This game\r\n    preserve, I pronounce \"uncertain\" because owing to several\r\n    inexplicable eventualities sportsmen innumerable, therefrom return\r\n    empty handed, whilst others, Mr. Chairman, make up, we know, pretty\r\n    good bags. The Son of Apollo, whilst thus hunting one gruesome, windy\r\n    morning, fortunately for us, sank in a boggy, yielding quicksand.\r\n    Luckily he extricated himself in time, and on reaching the margin of\r\n    the swamp, there stood an old pet of his tethered as if waiting for\r\n    its loved rider, a vigorous Norman or Percheron steed. Our friend\r\n    bestrode him, cantered off, and never drew rein until he stood,\r\n    panting perhaps, but a winner in the race, on the top of a mount,\r\n    distant and of access arduous, called Parnassus.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion, Mr. LeMoine quoted the memorable lines from Macaulay,\r\n    written the night when his parliamentary defeat at Edinburgh, in 1847,\r\n    restored him to letters:--\r\n\r\n      The day of tumult, strife, defeat, was o'er,\r\n      Worn out with toil, and noise, and scorn, and spleen,\r\n      I slumbered and in slumber saw once more\r\n      A room in an old mansion, long unseen.\r\n\r\n      That room, methought, was curtained from the light;\r\n      Yet through the curtains shone the moon's cold ray\r\n      Full on a cradle, where, in linen white,\r\n      Sleeping life's first sleep, an infant lay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      And lo! the fairy queens who rule our birth\r\n      Drew nigh to speak the new-born baby's doom:\r\n      With noiseless step, which left no trace on earth,\r\n      From gloom they came, and vanished into gloom.\r\n\r\n      Not deigning on the boy a glance to cast\r\n      Swept careless by the gorgeous Queen of Gain.\r\n      More scornful still, the Queen of Fashion passed,\r\n      With mincing gait and sneer of cold disdain.\r\n\r\n      The Queen of Power tossed high her jewelled head\r\n      And o'er her shoulder threw a wrathful frown.\r\n      The Queen of Pleasure on the pillow shed\r\n      Scarce one stray rose-leaf from her fragrant crown.\r\n\r\n      Still fay in long procession followed fay;\r\n      And still the little couch remained unblest:\r\n      But, when those wayward sprites had passed away,\r\n      Came One, the last, the mightiest, and the best.\r\n\r\n      Oh! glorious lady, with the eyes of light,\r\n      And laurels clustering round thy lofty brow,\r\n      Who by the cradle's side didst watch that night,\r\n      Warbling a sweet strange music, who wast thou?\r\n\r\n      \"Yes, darling; let them go,\" so ran the strain:\r\n      \"Yes; let them go, gain, fashion, pleasure, power,\r\n      And all the busy elves to whose domain\r\n      Belongs the nether sphere, the fleeting hour.\r\n\r\n      \"Without one envious sigh, one anxious scheme,\r\n      The nether sphere, the fleeting hour assign.\r\n      Mine is the world of thought, the world of dream,\r\n      Mine all the past, and all the future mine.\r\n\r\n       *       *        *       *        *\r\n\r\n      \"Of the fair brotherhood who share my grace,\r\n      I, from thy natal day, pronounce thee free;\r\n      And, if for some I keep a nobler place,\r\n      I keep for none a happier than for thee.\r\n\r\n       *       *        *       *        *\r\n\r\n      \"No; when on restless night dawns cheerless morrow,\r\n      When weary soul and wasting body pine,\r\n      Thine am I still in danger, sickness, sorrow,\r\n      In conflict, obloquy, want, exile, thine;\r\n\r\n      \"Thine where on mountain waves the snowbirds scream,\r\n      Where more than Thule's winter barbs the breeze,\r\n      Where scarce, through lowering clouds, one sickly gleam\r\n      Lights the drear May-day of Antarctic seas;\r\n\r\n       *       *        *       *        *\r\n\r\n      \"Amidst the din of all things fell and vile,\r\n      Hate's yell, and envy's hiss, and folly's bray,\r\n      Remember me!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_FORT ST. LOUIS, CHÂTEAU ST. LOUIS, HALDIMAND CASTLE._\r\n\r\n_CHÂTEAU ST. LOUIS._\r\n\r\nIn Professor Kalm's saunter round Quebec, his description of the public\r\nedifices, in 1749, is worthy of note:\r\n\r\n    \"The Palace (Château Saint Louis) says he, is situated on the west or\r\n    steepest side of the mountain, just, above the lower city. It is not\r\n    properly a palace, but a large building of stone, two stories high,\r\n    extending north and south. On the west side of it is a court-yard,\r\n    surrounded partly with a wall, and partly with houses. On the east\r\n    side, or towards the river, is a gallery as long as the whole\r\n    building, and about two fathoms broad, paved with smooth flags, and\r\n    included on the outside by iron rails, from whence the city and the\r\n    river exhibit a charming prospect. This gallery serves as a very\r\n    agreeable walk after dinner, and those who come to speak with the\r\n    Governor-General wait here till he is at leisure. The palace is the\r\n    lodging of the Governor-General of Canada, and a number of soldiers\r\n    mount the guard before it, both at the gate and in the court-yard; and\r\n    when the Governor, or the Bishop comes in or goes out, they must all\r\n    appear in arms and beat the drum. The Governor-General has his own\r\n    chapel where he hears prayers; however, he often goes to Mass at the\r\n    church of the _Récollets_, which is very near the palace.\"\r\n\r\nSuch it seemed, in 1749, to the learned Swedish naturalist and philosopher\r\nPeter Kalm. How many rainbow tints, poetry and romance can lend to the\r\nsame object, we may learn from the brilliant Niagara novelist, William\r\nKirby! In his splendid historical novel \"Le Chien d'Or,\" whilst venturing\r\non the boldest flights of imagination, he thus epitomises some striking\r\nhistorical features of the state residence of the French Viceroys of\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n    \"The great hall of the Castle of St. Louis was palatial in its\r\n    dimensions and adornment. The panels of wainscoting upon the walls\r\n    were hung with paintings of historic interest--portraits of the Kings,\r\n    Governors, Intendants and Ministers of State, who had been\r\n    instrumental in the colonization of New France.\r\n\r\n    \"Over the Governor's seat hung a gorgeous escutcheon of the Royal\r\n    arms, draped with a cluster of white flags, sprinkled with golden\r\n    lilies--the emblems of French sovereignty in the colony; among the\r\n    portraits on the walls, beside those of the late (Louis XIV.,) and\r\n    present King (Louis XV)--which hung on each side of the throne--might\r\n    be seen the features of Richelieu, who first organized the rude\r\n    settlements on the St. Lawrence in a body politic--a reflex of feudal\r\n    France; and of Colbert, who made available its natural wealth and\r\n    resources, by peopling it with the best scions of the Mother Land--the\r\n    noblesse and peasantry of Normandy, Brittany and Aquitaine. There,\r\n    too, might be seen the keen, bold features of Cartier, the first\r\n    discoverer, and of Champlain, the first explorer of the new land, and\r\n    the founder of Quebec. The gallant, restless Louis Buade de Frontenac\r\n    was pictured there, side by side with his fair countess, called, by\r\n    reason of her surpassing loveliness, \"The Divine.\" Vaudreuil, too, who\r\n    spent a long life of devotion to his country, and Beauharnois, who\r\n    nourished its young strength until it was able to resist, not only the\r\n    powerful confederacy of the Five Nations, but the still more powerful\r\n    league of New England and the other English Colonies. There, also,\r\n    were seen the sharp intellectual face of Laval, its first bishop, who\r\n    organized the church and education in the colony; and of Talon, wisest\r\n    of Intendants, who devoted himself to the improvement of agriculture,\r\n    the increase of trade, and the well being of all the King's subjects\r\n    in New France. And one more portrait was there, worthy to rank among\r\n    the statesmen and rulers of New France--the pale, calm, intellectual\r\n    features of Mère Marie de l'Incarnation--the first superior of the\r\n    Ursulines of Quebec, who in obedience to heavenly visions, as she\r\n    believed, left France to found schools for the children of the new\r\n    colonists, and who taught her own womanly graces to her own sex, who\r\n    were destined to become the future mothers of New France.\" (Page 109.)\r\n\r\nIt were difficult to group on a smaller and brighter canvass, so many of\r\nthe glorious figures of our storied past.\r\n\r\nIn the days of de Montmagny and later, the _Jesuits' Journal_ retraces gay\r\nscenes at the Château in connection with the festivals of the patron\r\nsaints, of St. Joseph, whose anniversary occurred on the 19th March, and\r\nof St. John the Baptist, whose _fête_ happened on the 24th June.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the old Château, was the meeting place of the Superior\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n    \"On any Monday morning one would have found the Superior Council in\r\n    session in the antechamber of the Governor's apartment, at the Château\r\n    St. Louis.  The members sat at a round table, at the head was the\r\n    Governor, with the Bishop on his right and the Intendant on his left.\r\n    The councillors sat in the order of their appointment, and the\r\n    attorney-general also had his place at the board. As La Hontan says,\r\n    they were not in judicial robes, but in their ordinary dress and all\r\n    but the Bishop wore swords. The want of the cap and the gown greatly\r\n    disturbed the Intendant Meules, and he begs the Minister to consider\r\n    how important it is that the councillors, in order to inspire respect,\r\n    should appear in public in long black robes, which on occasions of\r\n    ceremony they should exchange for robes of red. He thinks that the\r\n    principal persons of the colony should thus be induced to train up\r\n    their children to so enviable a dignity; \"and\" he concludes, \"as none\r\n    of the councillors can afford to buy red robes, I hope that the King\r\n    will vouchsafe to send out nine such; as for the black robes, they can\r\n    furnish those themselves.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The King did not respond, and the nine robes never arrived. The\r\n    official dignity of the Council was sometimes exposed to trials\r\n    against which even red gowns might have proven an insufficient\r\n    protection. The same Intendant urges that the tribunal ought to be\r\n    provided immediately with a house _of its own_.\"\r\n\r\n    \"It is not decent,\" he says, \"that it should sit in the Governor's\r\n    antechamber any longer. His guards and valets make such a noise, that\r\n    we cannot hear each other speak. I have continually to tell them to\r\n    keep quiet, which causes them to make a thousand jokes at the\r\n    councillors as they pass in and out. As the Governor and the council\r\n    were often on ill terms, the official head of the colony could not\r\n    always be trusted to keep his attendants on their good behaviour.\"\r\n    (Parkman's _Old Regime_, p. 273.)\r\n\r\nAt other times, startling incidents threw a pall over the old pile. Thus\r\nin August 1666, we are told of the melancholy end of a famous Indian\r\nwarrior: \"Tracy invited the Flemish Bastard and a Mohawk chief named\r\nAgariata to his table, when allusion was made to the murder of Chasy. On\r\nthis the Mohawk, stretching out his arm, exclaimed in a Braggart tone,\r\n\"This is the hand that split the head of that young man.\" The indignation\r\nof the company may be imagined. Tracy told his insolent guest that he\r\nshould never kill anybody else; and he was led out and hanged in presence\r\nof the Bastard. [33]\r\n\r\nVaried in language and nationality were the guests of the Château in days\r\nof yore: thus in 1693, the proud old Governor Frontenac had at one and the\r\nsame time Baron Saint Castin's Indian father-in-law, Madocawando, from\r\nAcadia, and \"a gentleman of Boston, John Nelson, captured by Villebon, the\r\nnephew and heir of Sir Thomas Temple, in whose right he claimed the\r\nproprietorship of Acadia, under an old grant of Oliver Cromwell.\"\r\n(Parkman's _Frontenac_, p. 357.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_FORT ST. LOUIS_\r\n\r\nEre one of the last vestiges of the _ancien régime_, Haldimand Castle,\r\ndisappears, a few details culled from reliable sources may not be\r\nunacceptable, especially as by fire, repairs and the vicissitudes of time,\r\nthe changes are so great, as to render difficult the delineation of what\r\nit originally formed part of in the past.\r\n\r\nGrave misconceptions exist as to what constituted the stately residence of\r\nour former Governors. Many imagine that the famous _Château St. Louis_,\r\nwas but one structure, whilst in reality, it was composed at one time of\r\nthree, viz:--Fort St. Louis, Château St. Louis and Haldimand Castle, the\r\npresent Normal School. The writer has succeeded in collecting together\r\nnine views of the Fort and Château St. Louis since the days of Champlain\r\ndown to modern times. Champlain's \"brass bell\" is conspicuous in more than\r\none of the designs.\r\n\r\nAccording to Father DuCreux, the first fort erected by Champlain on the\r\ncrest of the promontory, _arx aedificata in promontarii cuspidine_,\r\nwas not placed on the site of Dufferin Terrace, but at the south-east\r\npoint of the area, which is now occupied by the Grand Battery, north-east\r\nof the present Parliament building and looking down on Sault-au-Matelot\r\nstreet. Champlain subsequently removed it to a still more elevated site;\r\nits bastions, towers and ramparts surrounded the space on which the former\r\nGovernor's residence, soldier's barracks, magazine, &c., were constructed.\r\n\r\n    \"The fortress, says Bouchette, (Fort) of St. Louis covered about four\r\n    acres of ground, and formed nearly a parallelogram; on the western\r\n    side two strong bastions on each angle were connected by a curtain, in\r\n    the centre of which was a sallyport: the other faces presented works\r\n    of nearly a similar description, but of less dimensions.\" [34]\r\n\r\nWe may add that Fort St. Louis, shown on the plan of Quebec of 1660,\r\npublished by Abbé Faillon, and more plainly exhibited on Jeffery's map of\r\nQuebec, published in London in 1760, disappears after the conquest. No\r\nmention is made of it in 1775, and still less in 1784, as a fortress.\r\n\r\nChamplain, in his deposition, [35] sworn to, on the 9th Nov. 1629, in\r\nLondon, before the Right Worshipful Sir Henry Martin, Knight, Judge of the\r\nHigh Court of Admiralty, describes minutely, the armament and belongings\r\nof Fort St. Louis, on the 9th August 1629, when he surrendered it to the\r\nKirkes: cannon such as they were, and ammunition he seems to have had in\r\nabundance, without forgetting what he styles \"the murderers with their\r\ndouble boxes or charges,\" a not excessively deadly kind of\r\n_mitrailleuse_ or Gatling gun, we should imagine; the Fort also contained\r\na smith's forge, carpenter's tools, machinery for a windmill, and a\r\nhandmill to grind corn, a brass bell--probably to sound the tocsin, or\r\nalarm, at the approach of the marauding savages of Stadacona, the array\r\nof muskets--(thirteen complete)--is not formidable. Who was the maker of\r\nhis pistol-proof coats-of-mail?\r\n\r\n\r\n    _NEW CHÂTEAU ST. LOUIS._\r\n\r\n      \"Such dusky grandeur clothed the height\r\n      Where the huge castle holds its state,\r\n      And all the steep slope down\r\n      Whose ridgy back heaves to the sky,\r\n      Piled deep and massy, close and high\r\n      Mine own romantic town.\"\r\n                       (Scott's _Marmion_.)\r\n\r\n    \"Few circumstances of discussion and enquiry, says Hawkins, are more\r\n    interesting than the history and fate of ancient buildings, especially\r\n    if we direct our attention to the fortunes and vicissitudes of those\r\n    who were connected with them. The temper, genius and pursuits of an\r\n    historical era are frequently delineated in the features of remarkable\r\n    edifices, nor can any one contemplate them without expressing\r\n    curiosity, concerning those who first formed the plan, and afterwards\r\n    created and tenanted the structure. These observations apply\r\n    particularly to the subject of this chapter.\r\n\r\n    The history of the ancient Castle of St. Louis, or Fort of Quebec, for\r\n    above two centuries the seat of Government in the Province (of\r\n    Quebec), affords subjects of great and stirring interest during its\r\n    several periods. The hall of the old Fort during the weakness of the\r\n    colony was often a scene of terror and despair at the inroads of the\r\n    persevering and ferocious Iroquois, who, having passed or overthrown\r\n    all the French outposts, more than once threatened the fort itself and\r\n    massacred some friendly Indians within sight of its walls. Here, too,\r\n    in intervals of peace, were laid those benevolent plans for the\r\n    religious instruction and conversion of the savages which at one time\r\n    distinguished the policy of the ancient governors. At a later era,\r\n    when, under the protection of the French kings, the province had\r\n    acquired the rudiments of military strength and power, the Castle of\r\n    St. Louis was remarkable as having been the site whence the French\r\n    governors exercised an immense sovereignty, extending from the Gulf of\r\n    St. Lawrence, along the shores of that noble river, its magnificent\r\n    lakes, and down the course of the Mississippi to its outlet below New\r\n    Orleans. The banner which first streamed from the battlements of\r\n    Quebec was displayed from a chain of forts which protected the\r\n    settlements throughout this vast extent of country, keeping the\r\n    English colonies in constant alarm, and securing the fidelity of the\r\n    Indian nations. During this period the council-chamber of the castle\r\n    was the scene of many a midnight vigil [36]--many a long deliberation\r\n    and deep-laid project to free the continent from the intrusion of the\r\n    ancient rival of France and assert the supremacy of the Gallic lily.\r\n    At another era, subsequent to the surrender of Quebec to the British\r\n    armies, and until the recognition of the independence of the United\r\n    States, the extent of empire of the government of which the Castle of\r\n    Quebec was the principal seat, comprehended the whole American\r\n    continent north of Mexico. It is astonishing to reflect for a moment,\r\n    to how small, and, as to size, comparatively insignificant an island\r\n    in the Atlantic ocean this gigantic territory was once subject. Here\r\n    also was rendered to the representative of the French king, with all\r\n    its ancient forms, the fealty and homage of the noblesse and military\r\n    retainers, who held possessions in the province under the crown. A\r\n    feudal ceremony, suited to early times, which imposed a real and\r\n    substantial obligation on those who performed it, not to be violated\r\n    without forfeiture and dishonour. The king of Great Britain having\r\n    succeeded to the rights of the French crown, this ceremony is still\r\n    retained.\r\n\r\n    \"Fealty and homage is rendered at this day (1834) by the seigniors to\r\n    the Governor, as the representative of the sovereign, in the following\r\n    form: His Excellency being in full dress and seated in a state chair,\r\n    surrounded by his staff, and attended by the Attorney-General, the\r\n    seignior, in an evening dress and wearing a sword, is introduced into\r\n    his presence by the Inspector General of the Royal Domain and Clerk of\r\n    the Land Roll, and having delivered up his sword, and kneeling upon\r\n    one knee before the Governor, places his right hand between his and\r\n    repeats the ancient oath of fidelity; after which a solemn act is\r\n    drawn up in a register kept for that purpose, which is signed by the\r\n    Governor and the seignior, and countersigned by the proper officers.\"\r\n    --(Hawkin's _Picture of Quebec_.)\r\n\r\n    The historian, Ferland, _Notes sur les Registres de Notre Dame de\r\n    Quebec_, relates one of the earliest instances (1634) of the manner\r\n    the _foi et hommage_ was rendered. It is that of Jean Guion (Dion?)\r\n    vassal of Robert Giffard, seignior of Beauport: \"Guion presents\r\n    himself in the presence of a notary, at the principal door of the\r\n    manor-house of Beauport; having knocked, one Boulle, farmer of\r\n    Giffard, opened the door and in reply to Guion's question, if the\r\n    seignior was at home, replied that he was not, but that he, Boulle,\r\n    was empowered to receive acknowledgments and homage for the vassals in\r\n    his name. After the which reply, the said Guion, being at the\r\n    principal door, placed himself on his knees, on the ground, with bare\r\n    head and without sword or spurs, and said three times these words:\r\n    'Monsieur de Beauport, Monsieur de Beauport, Monsieur de Beauport, I\r\n    bring you the faith and homage which I am bound to bring you on\r\n    account of my _fief_ Du Buisson, which I hold as a man of faith\r\n    of your seigniory of Beauport, declaring that I offer to pay my\r\n    seigniorial and feudal dues in their season, and demanding of you to\r\n    accept me in faith and homage as aforesaid.'\" (Parkman's _Old\r\n    Regime_, p 246.)\r\n\r\n    \"Of these buildings (says Bouchette), the Castle of St. Louis being\r\n    the most prominent object on the summit of the rock--will obtain the\r\n    first notice.\r\n\r\n    \"It is a handsome stone building seated near the edge of a precipice,\r\n    * * and supported towards the steep by a solid work of masonry, rising\r\n    nearly half the height of the edifice, and surmounted by a spacious\r\n    gallery, * * * The whole pile is 162 feet long by 45 feet broad, and\r\n    three stories high * * * Each extremity is terminated by a small wing,\r\n    giving to the whole an easy and regular character.\r\n\r\n    \"It was built shortly after the city was fortified with solid works,\r\n    * * *--for a long series of years it was neglected, so much as to be\r\n    suffered to go to decay, and ceasing to be the residence of the\r\n    Commander-in-Chief, was used only for the offices of Government until\r\n    the year 1808, when a resolution passed the Provincial Parliament for\r\n    repairing and beautifying it; the sum of £1,000 was at the same time\r\n    voted, and the work forthwith commenced.\r\n\r\n    \"The money applied was inadequate to defray the expenses--upon the\r\n    grand scale the improvements were commenced, but an additional grant\r\n    was made to cover the whole charge, * * *\r\n\r\n    \"Sir James Craig took possession of it, etc.\r\n\r\n    \"The part properly called the Château occupies one side of the square\r\n    or court-yard; on the opposite side stands an extensive building\r\n    (Haldimand Castle) divided among the offices of Government, both civil\r\n    and military, that are under the immediate control of the Governor, it\r\n    contains also a handsome suite of apartments where the balls and other\r\n    public entertainments of the court are always given. During the\r\n    dilapidated state of the Château, this building was occupied by the\r\n    family of the Governors. Both the exterior and the interior are in a\r\n    very plain style, it forms part of the curtain that ran between the\r\n    two exterior bastions of the old fortress of St. Louis, adjoining it\r\n    are several other buildings of smaller size, appropriated to similar\r\n    uses, a guard house, stables, and extensive riding house, of these\r\n    works only a few vestiges remain, except the eastern wall, which is\r\n    kept in solid repair. The new guard house and stables, both fronting\r\n    the parade, have a very neat exterior, the first forms the arc of a\r\n    circle and has a colonnade before it, the stables are attached to the\r\n    riding house, which is spacious, and in every way well adapted to its\r\n    intended purpose, it is also used for drilling the city militia\"--\r\n    (Bouchette's _Topography of Lower Canada_, 1815, p. 431-4.)\r\n\r\nThe brilliant biographer of \"Frontenac\" and author of the, \"Old Regime,\"\r\nthus sums up from the official correspondence of the French Governors and\r\nIntendants the foundation, reconstructions and alterations in the Fort and\r\nChâteau.\r\n\r\n    \"This structure,\" says Francis Parkman, \"destined to be famous in\r\n    Canadian history, was originally built by Samuel de Champlain. The\r\n    cellar still remains under the wooden platform of the present Durham\r\n    (now Dufferin) Terrace. Behind the château was the area of the fort,\r\n    now an open square. In the most famous epoch of its history, the time\r\n    of Frontenac, the château was old and dilapidated, and the fort was in\r\n    sad condition.\" \"The walls are all down,\" writes Frontenac in 1681,\r\n    \"there are neither gates nor guard-houses, the whole place is open.\"\r\n    On this the new Intendant Meules was ordered to report what repairs\r\n    were needed. Meanwhile la Barre had come to replace Frontenac, whose\r\n    complaints he repeats. He says that the wall is in ruins for a\r\n    distance of a hundred and eighty _toises_. \"The workmen ask 6,000\r\n    francs to repair it. I could get it done in France for 2,000. The cost\r\n    frightens me. I have done nothing.\"--(_La Barre au Ministre_, 1682).\r\n    Meules, however, received orders to do what was necessary, and, two\r\n    years later, he reports that he had rebuilt the wall, repaired the\r\n    fort, and erected a building, intended at first for the council,\r\n    within the area. This building stood near the entrance of the present\r\n    St. Louis street, and was enclosed by an extension of the fort wall.\r\n\r\n    Denonville next appears on the scene, with his usual disposition to\r\n    fault-finding. \"The so-called château,\" he says (1685), \"is built of\r\n    wood, and is dry as a match. There is a place where with a bundle of\r\n    straw it could be set on fire at any time,... some of the gates will\r\n    not close, there is no watchtower, and no place to shoot from.\"--\r\n    (_Denonville au Ministre_, 20 _Août_, 1685).\r\n\r\n    When Frontenac resumed the Government, he was much disturbed at the\r\n    condition of the château, and begged for slate to cover the roof, as\r\n    the rain was coming in everywhere. At the same time the Intendant\r\n    Champigny reports it to be rotten and ruinous. This was in the year\r\n    made famous by the English attack, and the dramatic scene in the hall\r\n    of the old building when Frontenac defied the envoy of Admiral Phipps,\r\n    whose fleet lay in the river below. In the next summer, 1691,\r\n    Frontenac again asks for slate to cover the roof, and for 15,000 or\r\n    20,000 francs to repair his mansion.\r\n\r\n    In the next year the king promised to send him 12,000 francs, in\r\n    instalments. Frontenac acknowledges the favour, and says that he will\r\n    erect a new building, and try in the meantime not to be buried under\r\n    the old one, as he expects to be every time the wind blows hard.--\r\n    (_Frontenac au Ministre_, 15 _Septembre_, 1692). A misunderstanding\r\n    with the Intendant, who had control of the money, interrupted the\r\n    work. Frontenac writes the next year that he had been \"obliged to send\r\n    for carpenters during the night, to prop up the château, lest he\r\n    should be crushed under the ruins.\" The wall of the fort was, however,\r\n    strengthened, and partly rebuilt to the height of sixteen feet, at a\r\n    cost of 13,629 francs. It was a time of war, and a fresh attack was\r\n    expected from the English.--(_Frontenac et Champigny au Ministre_, 4\r\n    _Nov_, 1693). In the year 1854, the workmen employed in demolishing a\r\n    part of this wall, adjoining the garden of the château, found a copper\r\n    plate bearing an inscription in Latin as follows--\r\n\r\n                                 D.

Frontenac is profuse in\r\n    thanks, and at the same time begs for another 6,000 francs, \"to\r\n    complete a work which is the ornament and beauty of the city\" (1696).\r\n    The Minister sent 8,000 more, which was soon gone; and Frontenac drew\r\n    on the royal treasurer for 5,047 in addition. The Intendant complains\r\n    of his extravagance, and says that he will have nothing but\r\n    perfection; and that besides the château, he has insisted on building\r\n    two guard-houses, with mansard roofs, at the two sides of the gate. \"I\r\n    must do as he says,\" adds the Intendant, \"or there will be a quarrel.\"\r\n    (_Champigny au Ministre_, 13 _Oct._, 1697). In a letter written two\r\n    days after, Frontenac speaks with great complacency of his château,\r\n    and asks for another 6,000 francs to finish it. As the case was urgent\r\n    he sold six more licenses at 1,000 francs each, but he died too soon\r\n    to see the completion of his favorite work (1698). The new château was\r\n    not finished before 1700, and even then it had no cistern. In a pen\r\n    sketch of Quebec, on a manuscript map of 1699, preserved in the Dépôt\r\n    de Cartes de la Marine, the new château is distinctly represented. In\r\n    front is a gallery or balcony resting on a wall and buttresses at the\r\n    edge of the cliff. Above the gallery is a range of high windows, along\r\n    the face of the building, and over these a range of small windows and\r\n    a mansard roof. In the middle is a porch opening on the gallery, and\r\n    on the left extends a battery, on the ground now occupied by a garden\r\n    along the brink of the cliff. A water-colour sketch of the château\r\n    taken in 1804, from the land side, by William Morrison, Jr., is in my\r\n    possession. [37] The building appears to have been completely\r\n    remodelled in the interval. It is two stories in height, the mansard\r\n    roof is gone, and a row of attic windows surmount the second story. In\r\n    1809 it was again remodelled at a cost of ten thousand pounds\r\n    sterling, a third story was added, and the building, resting on the\r\n    buttresses which still remain under the balustrade of Durham\r\n    (Dufferin) Terrace, had an imposing effect when seen from the river.\r\n    It was destroyed by fire in 1834.--(Parkman's _Old Regime_.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHALDIMAND CASTLE\r\n\r\nAfter sketching Fort St. Louis, begun in 1624,--a refuge against the\r\nIroquois, and whose bastions rendered useless disappeared shortly after\r\nthe conquest, as well as giving the history of the Château St. Louis\r\nproper, destroyed by fire 23rd January, 1834, it behoves us to close the\r\nnarrative with a short account of the origin of the wing or new building\r\nstill extant, and used since 1871 as the Normal School. This structure\r\ngenerally, though improperly styled the _Old Château_, dates back to\r\nthe last century. On the 5th May, 1784, the corner stone was laid with\r\nsuitable ceremonies, by the Governor-General, Sir Frederick Haldimand; the\r\nChâteau St. Louis had been found inadequate in size for the various\r\npurposes required, viz.: a Vice-regal residence, a Council room for the\r\nLegislative, the Executive and Judiciary Councils, &c.\r\n\r\nThe Province was rapidly expanding, as well as the Viceroy's levees,\r\nofficial balls, public receptions, &c.; suites of rooms and stately\r\nchambers, became indispensible.\r\n\r\nThe following incident occurred during its construction:--On the 17th\r\nSeptember, 1784, the workmen at the Château in levelling the yard, dug up\r\na large stone with a Maltese cross engraved on it, bearing the date\r\n\"1647.\" One of Wolfe's veterans, Mr. James Thompson, Overseer of Public\r\nWorks, got the masons to lay the stone in the cheek of the gate of the new\r\nbuilding. A wood-cut of the stone, gilt at the expense of Mr. Ernest\r\nGagnon, City Councillor in 1872, appeared in the _Morning Chronicle_\r\nof the 24th June, 1880. Let us hope when the site shall be transferred,\r\nthat the Hon. Premier will have a niche reserved for this historic relic\r\nas was so appropriately done by Sir H L Langevin, for the \"Chien d'Or\"\r\ntablet when the new city Post Office was built in 1871-3.\r\n\r\nHaldimand Castle soon became a building of note. On the 19th January,\r\n1787, the anniversary of the Queen's Birthday--Charlotte of Mecklenburg,\r\nconsort of George III., the first grand reception was held there. In the\r\nfollowing summer, the future monarch of Great Britain, William IV., the\r\nsailor prince, aged 22 years, visited his father's loyal Canadian lieges.\r\nPrince William Henry had then landed, on 14th August, in the Lower Town\r\nfrom H. M. frigate \"Pegasus.\" Traditions repeat that the young Duke of\r\nClarence enjoyed himself amazingly among the _beau monde_ of Quebec,\r\nhaving eyes for more than the scenic beauties of the \"Ancient Capital,\"\r\nnot unlike other worthy Princes who came after him.\r\n\r\n    \"He took an early opportunity of visiting the Ursulines, and by his\r\n    polite and affable manner quite won the hearts of those worthy\r\n    ladies.\"--(_Histoire des Ursulines_, vol. III, p. 183.)\r\n\r\nSorel, in honour of his visit, changed its name into Fort William Henry.\r\nAmong other festivities at Quebec, Lord Dorchester, Governor-General, the\r\nsuccessor to Sir Frederick Haldimand, on the 21st August, 1787, treated H.\r\nR. Highness to a grand pyrotechnic display. \"Prince William Henry and his\r\ncompany, being seated on an exalted platform, erected by the Overseer of\r\nPublic Works, James Thompson, over a powder magazine joining the end of\r\nthe new building (Haldimand Castle), while the fireworks were displayed on\r\nan eminence fronting it below the _old_ Citadel.\"--(_Thompson's Diary._)\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE QUEBEC AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY._\r\n\r\nIn the stately reception room of the Castle was founded, in 1789, the\r\n_Quebec Agricultural Society_.\r\n\r\n    \"On the 6th April, the rank and fashion, nobility and clergy of all\r\n    denominations, as well as commoners, crowded at the _Château St.\r\n    Louis_, to enter their names as subscribers to the Quebec Agricultural\r\n    Society, warmly patronized by his Excellency Lord Dorchester, Hon.\r\n    Hugh Finlay, Deputy Postmaster-General, was chosen Secretary.\r\n\r\n    The _Quebec Gazette_ of the 23rd April, 1789, will supply the names,\r\n    the list is suggestive on more points than one.\r\n\r\n    Rev.

It was indeed a novel\r\nidea, that loyal league, which exhibited both R. C and Anglican Bishops,\r\neach putting their hands in their pockets to help Protestant England to\r\nrout the armies of the \"eldest son of the Church,\" represented by the\r\nFirst Consul; so general and so intense was the horror inspired by\r\nrevolutionary and regicide France.\r\n\r\n    Though in the past, as at present, attempts were occasionally made to\r\n    stir up discord amongst our citizens, there appears more than once,\r\n    traces of enlarged patriotism and loyalty to the mother country,\r\n    animating all classes. This seems conspicuous in the public invitation\r\n    by men of both nationalities, inserted in a public journal, for 1799,\r\n    to form a national fund in order to help England with the war waged\r\n    against France; this invitation not only bears the signatures of\r\n    leading English citizens, but also those of several Quebecers of\r\n    French extraction, rejoicing in old and historic names such as the\r\n    following.\"--(_Quebec, Past and Present_, page 244.)\r\n\r\n    Hon.

After deep research, profound cogitation\r\n    and much ink used in the public prints, 1647, the present date,\r\n    prevailed, and Mr. Ernest Gagnon, then a City Councillor, had this\r\n    precious relic restored and gilt at his cost.\r\n\r\n    The date 1647 also agrees with the Jesuits _Relation_, which states\r\n    that, in 1647, under Governor de Montmagny, one of the bastions was\r\n    lined with stone; additional light was thrown on this controversy, by\r\n    the inspection of a deed of agreement, bearing date at Fort St. Louis,\r\n    19th October, 1646, exhumed from the Court House vaults, and signed by\r\n    the stonemasons who undertook to _revetir de murailles un bastion qui\r\n    est au bas de l'allee du Mont Caluaire, descendant au Fort St. Louis_,\r\n    for which work they were to receive from _Monsieur Bourdon_, engineer\r\n    and surveyor, 2,000 _livres_ and a puncheon of wine.\r\n\r\n    This musty, dry-as-dust, old document gives rise to several enquiries.\r\n    One not the least curious, is the luxurious mode of life, which the\r\n    puncheon of wine supposes among stonemasons at such a remote period of\r\n    Quebec history as 1646. Finally, it was decided that this stone and\r\n    cross were intended to commemorate the year in which the Fort St.\r\n    Louis Bastion, begun in 1646, was finished, viz., 1647.\r\n\r\n    This historic stone, which has nothing in common with the\r\n\r\n      \"Stone of Blarney\r\n      On the banks of Killarney,\"\r\n\r\n    cropped up again more than a century later, in the days when Sergeant\r\n    Jas. Thompson, one of Wolfe's veterans, was overseer of public works\r\n    at Quebec--(he died in 1830, aged 98.) We read in his unpublished\r\n    diary. \"The cross in the wall, September 17th, 1784. The miners at the\r\n    Château, in levelling the yard, dug up a large stone, from which I\r\n    have described the annexed figure (identical with the present), I\r\n    could wish it was discovered soon enough to lay conspicuously in the\r\n    wall of the new building, (Haldimand Castle), in order to convey to\r\n    posterity the antiquity of the Château St. Louis. However, I got the\r\n    masons to lay the stone in the cheek of the gate of new building.\"\r\n    Extract from _James Thompson's Diary_, 1759-1830.\r\n\r\n    Col. J. Hale, grandfather to our esteemed fellow townsman, E. J. Hale,\r\n    Esq., and one of Wolfe's companions-at-arms, used to tell how he had\r\n    succeeded in having this stone saved from the _débris_ of the Château\r\n    walls, and restored a short time before the Duke of Clarence, the\r\n    sailor prince (William IV), visited Quebec in 1787.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, the Castle opened its portals to rather unexpected but, nor\r\nthe less welcome, visitors. On the 13th March, 1789, His Excellency Lord\r\nDorchester had the satisfaction of entertaining a stalwart woodsman and\r\nexpert hunter, Major Fitzgerald of the 54th Regiment, then stationed at\r\nSt. John, New Brunswick, the son of a dear old friend, Lady Emilia Mary,\r\ndaughter of the Duke of Richmond. This chivalrous Irishman was no less\r\nthan the dauntless Lord Edward Fitzgerald, fifth son of the Duke of\r\nLeinster, the true but misguided patriot, who closed his promising career\r\nin such a melancholy manner in prison, during the Irish rebellion in 1798.\r\nLord Edward had walked up on snowshoes through the trackless forest, from\r\nNew Brunswick to Quebec, a distance of 175 miles, in twenty-six days,\r\naccompanied by a brother officer, Mr. Brisbane, a servant and two\r\n\"woodsmen.\" This feat of endurance is pleasantly described by himself.\r\n\r\nTom Moore, in his biography of this generous, warmhearted son of Erin,\r\namong other dutiful epistles addressed by Lord Edward to his mother, has\r\npreserved the following, of which we shall give a few extracts:--\r\n\r\n    QUEBEC, March 14, 1789.\r\n\r\n    DEAREST MOTHER,--I got here yesterday after a very long and, what some\r\n    people would think, a very tedious and fatiguing journey; but to me it\r\n    was, at most, only a little fatiguing, and to make up for that, it was\r\n    delightful and quite new. We were thirty days on our march, twenty-six\r\n    of which we were in the woods, and never saw a soul but our own party.\r\n\r\n    You must know we came through a part of the country that had always\r\n    been reckoned impassable. In short, instead of going a long way about,\r\n    we determined to try and get straight through the woods, and see what\r\n    kind of country it was. I believe I mentioned my party in a letter to\r\n    Ogilvie (his step-father) before I left St. Anne's or Fredericton: it\r\n    was an officer of the regiment, Tonny, and two woodsmen. The officer\r\n    and I used to draw part of our baggage day about, and the other day\r\n    steer (by compass), which we did so well, that we made the point we\r\n    intended within ten miles. We were only wrong in computing our\r\n    distances and making them a little too great, which obliged us to\r\n    follow a new course, and make a river, which led us round to Quebec,\r\n    instead of going straight to it. * * * I expect my leave by the first\r\n    despatches. * * * I shall not be able to leave this part of the world\r\n    till May, as I cannot get my leave before that. How I do long to see\r\n    you. Your old love, Lord Dorchester, is very civil to me. I must,\r\n    though, tell you a little more of the journey. After making the river,\r\n    we fell in with some savages, and travelled with them to Quebec; they\r\n    were very kind to us, and said we were \"all one brother,\" \"all one\r\n    indian.\" They fed us the whole time we were with them. You would have\r\n    laughed to have seen me carrying an old squaw's pack, which was so\r\n    heavy I could hardly waddle under it. However, I was well paid\r\n    whenever we stopped, for she always gave me the best bits and most\r\n    soup, and took as much care of me as if I had been her own son; in\r\n    short, I was quite _l'enfant chéri_. We were quite sorry to part:\r\n    the old lady and gentleman both kissed me very heartily. I gave the\r\n    old lady one of Sophia's silver spoons, which pleased her very much.\r\n    When we got here, you may guess what figures we were. We had not\r\n    shaved nor washed during the journey; our blanket-coats and trousers\r\n    all worn out and pieced, in short, we went to two or three houses and\r\n    they would not let us in. There was one old lady, exactly the\r\n    _hôtesse_ in Gil Blas, _elle me prit la mesure du pied jusqu'à\r\n    la tête_, and told me there was one room, without a stove or bed,\r\n    next a billiard room, which I might have if I pleased, and when I her\r\n    told we were gentlemen, she very quietly said, \"I dare say you are,\"\r\n    and off she went. However, at last we got lodgings in an ale house,\r\n    and you may guess ate well and slept well, and went next day well\r\n    dressed, with one of Lord Dorchester's aide-de-camps to triumph over\r\n    the old lady; in short, exactly the story in Gil Blas.\r\n\r\n    We are quite curiosities here after our journey, some think we were\r\n    mad to undertake it, some think we were lost; some will have it we\r\n    were starved; there were a thousand lies, but we are safe and well,\r\n    enjoying rest and good eating, most completely. One ought really to\r\n    take these fillips now and then, they make one enjoy life a great deal\r\n    more.\r\n\r\n    The hours here are a little inconvenient to us as yet; whenever we\r\n    wake at night we want to eat, the same as in the woods, and as soon as\r\n    we eat we want to sleep. In our journey we were always up two hours\r\n    before day, to load and get ready to march, we used to stop between\r\n    three and four, and it generally took us from that till night to\r\n    shovel out the snow, cut wood, cook and get ready for night, so that\r\n    immediately after our suppers we were asleep, and whenever any one\r\n    awakes in the night, he puts some wood on the fire, and eats a bit\r\n    before he lies down again; but for my part, I was not much troubled\r\n    with waking in the night.\r\n\r\n    \"I really do think there is no luxury equal to that of lying before a\r\n    good fire on a good spruce bed, after a good supper, and a hard moose\r\n    chase in a fine clear frosty moonlit starry night. But to enter into\r\n    the spirit of this, you must understand what a moose chase is: the man\r\n    himself runs the moose down by pursuing the track. Your success in\r\n    killing depends on the number of people you have to pursue and relieve\r\n    one another in going first (which is the fatiguing part of snow-\r\n    shoeing), and on the depth and hardness of the snow, for when the snow\r\n    is hard and has a crust, the moose cannot get on, as it cuts his legs,\r\n    and then he stops to make battle. But when the snow is soft, though it\r\n    be above his belly, he will go on three, four or five days, for then\r\n    the man cannot get on so fast, as the snow is heavy and he only gets\r\n    his game by perseverance--an Indian never gives him up.\" Then follows\r\n    a most graphic description of a hunt--closing with the death of the\r\n    noble quarry.\r\n\r\n    \"Pray,\" continues Lord Edward, \"write to uncle Richmond, I would write\r\n    if there was time, but I have only time to fill up this.\"\r\n\r\n    Tom Moore adds, that the plan of Lord Edward's route through the woods\r\n    was forwarded from Quebec to the Duke of Richmond, by Mr. Hamilton\r\n    Moore, in a letter dated Quebec, May 22nd, 1789, this letter closes\r\n    with the following:--\"Lord Edward has met with the esteem and\r\n    admiration of all here.\"\r\n\r\n    In a subsequent epistle to Mr. Ogilvie, his step-father, dated\r\n    \"Quebec, 12th April, 1789,\" Lord Edward mentions the death of the\r\n    Lieut.-Governor of Quebec (Major Patrick Bellew). \"It is a place of\r\n    £1,600 a year, and I think would do well for Charles. The day before\r\n    he died I was in treaty for his Lieut.-Colonelcy in the 44th\r\n    Regiment.\"\r\n\r\n    Later, on 4th May, 1789, he writes from Montreal, and speaks\r\n    gratefully of the open-handed hospitality extended to him, and of the\r\n    kind lady friends he met at Quebec. (Page 67.)\r\n\r\nAlas! generous youth, what foul fiend, three year later, inspired you,\r\nwith Tom Paine as your adviser, to herd at Paris with the regicide crew,\r\nand howl the \"_Carmagnole_\" and \"_Çà Ira_,\" with the hideous monsters who\r\nrevelled in blood under the holy name of liberty?\r\n\r\nAgain, one follows the patriotic Irish nobleman, in 1793, plighting his\r\nfaith to a lovely and noble bride, Pamela Sims, the youthful daughter of\r\nthe Duke of Orleans, by Madame de Genlis.\r\n\r\nA few short years and the ghastly phantom of death, in a dismal prison, in\r\nthe dearly loved land of his birth, spreads a pall over what might have\r\nbeen to his unfortunate country, a career full of honour. Alas! brave,\r\nnoble Edward! Poor, pretty little Pamela, alas!\r\n\r\nThe Castle had its sunshine and its shadows. Many still survive to tell of\r\nan impressive, and gloomy pageant. On the 4th September, 1819, previous to\r\ntheir transfer to the chancel of the Anglican Cathedral, were exposed in\r\nstate in the Château, the mortal remains of the late Governor-General, His\r\nGrace Charles Gordon Lennox, Duke of Richmond, Lennox and Aubigny, who, on\r\nthe 28th August, 1819, had died of hydrophobia.\r\n\r\nThe revolving wheel of time ushers in, with his successor, other actors,\r\nand other scenes. One likes to recall the presence there of a graceful and\r\nnoble Chatelaine, his daughter, Lady Sarah Lennox, the devoted wife of the\r\nadministrator of the Government of Lower Canada, Sir Peregrine Maitland,\r\n\"a tall, grave officer, says Dr. Scadding, always in military undress, his\r\ncountenance ever wearing a mingled expression of sadness and benevolence,\r\nlike that which one may observe on the face of the predecessor of Louis\r\nPhilippe, Charles the Tenth,\" whose current portraits recall, not badly,\r\nthe whole head and figure of this early Governor of Upper Canada.\r\n\r\n    \"In an outline representation which we (Dr. Scadding) accidentally\r\n    possessed, of a panorama of the battle of Waterloo, on exhibition in\r\n    London, the 1st Foot Guards were conspicuously to be seen, led on by\r\n    'Major General Sir Peregrine Maitland.'\" [38]\r\n\r\n    With persons of wider knowledge, Sir Peregrine was invested With\r\n    further associations. Besides being the royal representative in these\r\n    parts, he was the son-in-law of Charles Gordon Lennox, fourth Duke of\r\n    Richmond, a name that stirred chivalrous feelings in early Canadians\r\n    of both Provinces; for the Duke had come to Canada as Governor-in-\r\n    Chief, with a grand reputation acquired as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland,\r\n    and great benefits were expected, and probably would have been\r\n    realized, from his administration, had it been of long continuance.\r\n    But he had been suddenly removed by an excruciating death. Whilst on a\r\n    tour of inspection in the Upper Province, he had been fatally attacked\r\n    by hydrophobia, occasioned by the bite of a pet fox. The injury had\r\n    been received at Sorel; its terrible effects were fatally experienced\r\n    at a place near the Ottawa river called Richmond.\r\n\r\n    Some of the prestige of the deceased Duke continued to adhere to Sir\r\n    Peregrine Maitland, for he had married the Duke's daughter, a graceful\r\n    and elegant woman, who was always at his side here (York, now\r\n    Toronto), and at Stanford Cottage across the lake. She bore a name not\r\n    unfamiliar in the domestic annals of George III., who once, it is\r\n    said, was enamored of a beautiful Lady Sarah Lennox, grandmother, as\r\n    we suppose, or some other near relative of the Lady Sarah Lennox here\r\n    before us. However, conversationists whispered about (in confidence)\r\n    something supposed to be unknown to the general public, that the match\r\n    between Sir Peregrine and Lady Sarah had been effected in spite of the\r\n    Duke. The report was that there had been an elopement, and it was\r\n    naturally supposed that the party of the sterner sex bad been the most\r\n    active agent in the affair. To say the truth, however, in this\r\n    instance it was the lady who precipitated matters. The affair occurred\r\n    at Paris, soon after the Waterloo campaign. The Duke's final\r\n    determination against Sir Peregrine's proposals having been announced,\r\n    the daughter suddenly withdrew from the father's roof, and fled to the\r\n    lodgings of Sir Peregrine, who instantly retired to other quarters.\r\n    The upshot of the whole thing, at once romantic and unromantic,\r\n    included a marriage and a reconciliation, and eventually a Lieutenant-\r\n    Governorship for the son-in-law, under the Governorship-in-Chief of\r\n    the father, both despatched together to undertake the discharge of\r\n    vice-regal functions in a distant colony. At the time of his marriage\r\n    with Lady Sarah Lennox, Sir Peregrine had been for some ten years a\r\n    widower. [39] After the death of the Duke of Richmond, Sir Peregrine\r\n    became administrator, for a time of the general government of British\r\n    North America.\r\n\r\nOne of the Duke of Richmond's sons was lost in the ill-fated steamer\r\n_President_ in 1840. In December, 1824, Sir Peregrine revisited Quebec\r\nwith Sir Francis Burton, Lieutenant-Governor, in the _Swiftsure_, steamer\r\nescorting some very distinguished tourists. A periodical notices the\r\narrivals at the old Château as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Sir Peregrine is accompanied by Lord Arthur Lennox, Mr. Maitland,\r\n    Colonels Foster, Lightfoot, Coffin and Talbot, with the Hon. E. G.\r\n    Stanley (from 1851 to 1869 Earl of Derby), grandson of Earl Derby, M.\r\n    P. for Stockbridge; John E. Denison, Esq., (subsequently Speaker of\r\n    the House of Commons), M. P. for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and James S.\r\n    Wortley, Esq. (afterwards Lord Wharncliffe), M. P. for Bossiney in\r\n    Cornwall. The three latter gentlemen are upon a tour in this country\r\n    from England, and we are happy to learn, that they have expressed\r\n    themselves as being highly gratified with all they have hitherto seen\r\n    in Canada.\"--(_Canadian Review_, 1824.)\r\n\r\nQuebecers will be pleased to learn that the name of Sir Peregrine Maitland\r\nis pleasantly preserved by means of Maitland Scholarships in a grammar\r\nschool for natives at Madras, and by a Maitland Prize in the University of\r\nCambridge. Sir Peregrine, as patron of education, opened an era of\r\nprogress which his successors Lords Elgin, Dufferin and Lorne have\r\ncontinued in a most munificent manner.\r\n\r\nA curious glimpse of high life at Quebec, in the good old days of Lord\r\nDalhousie, is furnished in a letter addressed to _Delta_, of Blackwood's\r\nMagazine, by John Galt, the novelist, the respected father of our gifted\r\nstatesman, Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt. [40]\r\n\r\nThe talented author of the \"_Annals of the Parish_,\" after expatiating on\r\nthe dangers he had that day incurred in crossing over from Levis to Quebec\r\nin a canoe, among the ice-floes, thus alludes to the winter amusements:--\r\n\r\n    QUEBEC, 22nd February, 1827.\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR,--I am under very great obligations to you. A copy of the\r\n    \"Laird\" having come to the castle from the New York publishers, Lady\r\n    Dalhousie lent it to me. * * * I am much pleased with Quebec. It is at\r\n    present filled with Highland regiments, in which I have many\r\n    acquaintances and the hospitality of the other inhabitants is also\r\n    unbounded, for the winter suspends all business, and pleasure is\r\n    conducted as if it were business. The amateurs have a theatre, and I\r\n    wrote a piece for them, in which a Londoner, a Glasgow merchant, an\r\n    Irish girl, a Yankee family and a Highlander were introduced. It was\r\n    adapted entirely to the place, and in quiz of a very agreeable custom\r\n    --of everybody calling on strangers. Dr. Dunlop performed the\r\n    Highlander beyond anything I ever saw on the regular stage. The whole\r\n    went off with more laughter than anything I have ever seen, for the\r\n    jokes being local and personal (supplied by upwards of thirty\r\n    contributors), every one told with the utmost effect.\"\r\n\r\n    \"This farce, says Delta, composed at Quebec by J. Galt, and performed\r\n    there before the Earl of Dalhousie (then Governor-General), was named\r\n    \"The Visitors, or a Trip to Quebec,\" and was meant as a good humoured\r\n    satire on some of the particular usages of the place. An American\r\n    family figured as the visitors, and the piece opened with a scene in\r\n    an hôtel, when a waiter brings in a tea-tray loaded with cards of\r\n    callers, and the explanation of the initials having had reference to\r\n    people, many of whom were present at the performance, tended much to\r\n    make the thing pass off with great éclat. It seems that a custom\r\n    prevails there to a punctilious extent, of all the inhabitants of a\r\n    certain grade calling upon strangers and leaving their cards.\r\n\r\n    \"This flash of harmless lightning, however, assumed somewhat of a\r\n    malignant glare when seen from the United States. The drift of the\r\n    performance was, it seems, hideously misrepresented by some of the\r\n    newspapers, and it was said that Mr. Galt had ungratefully ridiculed\r\n    the Americans, notwithstanding the distinction and hospitality with\r\n    which they had received him. It thus came to pass that he promised,\r\n    when next in New York, to write another farce, in which liberty as\r\n    great should be taken with his own countrymen. \"An Aunt in Virginia\"\r\n    was the product of this promise, and with the alterations mentioned\r\n    and a change of scene from New York to London, it was published under\r\n    the name of \"Scotch and Yankees.\"\"\r\n\r\nA volume would not suffice to detail the brilliant receptions, gay routs,\r\n_levees_, state balls given at the Castle during Lord Dorchester's\r\nadministration--the lively discussions--the formal protests originating\r\nout of points of precedence, burning _questions de jupons_ between\r\nthe touchy magnates of the old and those of the new _regime_. Whether\r\nla Baronne de St. Laurent would be admitted there or not? Whether a de\r\nLongueuil's or a de Lanaudière's place was on the right of Lady Maria, the\r\ncharming consort of His Excellency Lord Dorchester--a daughter of the\r\ngreat English Earl of Effingham? Whether dancing ought to cease when their\r\nLordships the Bishops entered, and made their bow to the representative of\r\nroyalty? Unfortunately Quebec had then no Court Journal, so that following\r\ngenerations will have but faint ideas of all the witchery, the stunning\r\nhead-dresses, the _décolletées_, high-waisted robes of their stately\r\ngrandmothers, whirled round in the giddy waltz by whiskered, épauletted\r\ncavaliers, or else courtesying in the demure _menuet de la cour_.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1796, when Isaac Weld, Jr., visited Quebec, he describes the\r\nold part of the château as chiefly taken up with the public offices, all\r\nthe apartments in it, says he, \"are small and ill-contrived; but in the new\r\npart (Haldimand Castle) which stands in front of the other, facing the\r\nsquare (the ring), they are spacious and tolerably well furnished, but\r\nnone of them can be called elegant. This part is inhabited by the\r\nGovernor's family. * * * * Every evening during summer, when the weather\r\nis fine, one of the regiments of the garrison parades in the open place\r\nbefore the château, and the band plays for an hour or two, at which time\r\nthe place becomes the resort of numbers of the most genteel people of the\r\ntown, and has a very gay appearance.\" (_Weld's Travels through the States\r\nof North America in_ 1795-6-7, vol. 1, p. 351)\r\n\r\nIn 1807, when the deadly duel between England and Imperial France was at\r\nits height, Great Britain sent New France as her Viceroy, a military\r\nGovernor, equally remarkable for the sternness of his rule and for his\r\nlove of display, hence the name of \"Little King Craig,\" awarded to Sir\r\nJames Craig. To meet his requirements the House of Assembly voted in 1808,\r\na sum of £7,000 to repair the Château St. Louis. Sir James took up his\r\nquarters in the interim, in Castle Haldimand. The Château St. Louis\r\nreceived an additional story and was much enlarged. In 1812 an additional\r\nsum of £7,980 19s 4d was voted to cover the deficit in the repairs. Little\r\nKing Craig inhabited Château St. Louis during the winters of 1809-10-11,\r\noccupying Spencer Wood during the summer months. The _Château_ stables\r\nwere subsequently converted into a riding school, afterwards into a\r\ntheatre, where the exhibition of Harrison's Diorama caused the awful\r\ntragedy of 12th June, 1846. [41] The Earl of Durham, in 1838, struck with\r\nthe commanding position of this site, had the charred ruins of the old\r\nChâteau removed and erected a lofty platform which soon was called after\r\nhim \"Durham Terrace.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1851-2-3-4, Haldimand Castle was repaired at a cost of $13,718.42. In\r\n1854, Hon. Jean Chabot, member for Quebec and Commissioner of Public\r\nWorks, had Durham Terrace much enlarged; the adjoining walls were repaired\r\nat an expense of $4,209.92. More expenditure was incurred in 1857. When\r\nthe Laval Normal School was installed there, Bishop Langevin, then\r\nPrincipal, had the wing erected where the chapel stands. The vaulted room\r\nused as a kitchen for the Laval Normal School, was an old powder magazine;\r\nit is the most ancient portion of the building. The present Castle was, by\r\nOrder in Council of 14th February, 1871, transferred by the Dominion\r\nauthorities to the Government of the Province of Quebec, together with\r\nDurham Terrace, the Sewell Mansion, facing the Esplanade (Lieutenant-\r\nGovernor's office), also, the site and buildings of the Parliament House,\r\non Mountain Hill.\r\n\r\nThe extension of this lofty and beautiful Terrace, suggested to the City\r\nCouncil by the City Engineer in his report of 1872, necessarily formed a\r\nleading feature in the splendid scheme of city improvements, originated by\r\nthe Earl of Dufferin, with the assistance of Mr. Lynn, an eminent Irish\r\nengineer, and of our City Engineer, le Chevalier Baillairge. An appeal was\r\nmade by a true and powerful friend to Quebec (Lord Dufferin) to our\r\ngracious Sovereign, who contributed munificently from her private purse,\r\nfor the erection of the new gate, called after her late father, the Duke\r\nof Kent--Kent Gate, in remembrance of his long sojourn (1791-4) in this\r\ncity. Large sums were also granted by the Dominion, it is thought, chiefly\r\nthrough the powerful influence of Lord Dufferin, seconded by Sir H. L.\r\nLangevin; an appeal was also made for help to the City Council and not in\r\nvain; it responded by a vote of $7,500.\r\n\r\nThe front wall was built at the expense of the Dominion Government, and\r\noccupies part of the site of the old battery, erected on that portion of\r\nthe château garden granted to Major Samuel Holland in 1766.\r\n\r\nThe length of Dufferin Terrace is 1420 feet, and it is 182 feet above the\r\nlevel of the St. Lawrence. It forms part of the city fortifications. The\r\nsite can be resumed by the Commander of the Forces (the Governor-General)\r\nwhenever he may deem it expedient for objects within the scope of his\r\nmilitary authority.\r\n\r\nDurham Terrace, increased to four times its size, now forms a link in the\r\nDufferin plans of city embellishment, of which the corner stone was laid\r\nby the Earl of Dufferin on the 18th October, 1878, and was authentically\r\nrecognized as \"Dufferin Terrace\" in April and May, 1879, in the official\r\nrecords of the City Council; several iron plates were inserted in the\r\nflooring with the inscription, \"_Dufferin Terrace, H. Hatch, contractor,\r\nC. Baillairge, engineer._\" But a famous name of the past, which many\r\nloved to connect with this spot--that of Louis de Buade, Count de\r\nFrontenac, was not forgotten. The Literary and Historical Society of\r\nQuebec, on the 18th April, 1879, presented to the City Council a petition,\r\nasking among other things, that one of the handsome kiosks on the Terrace\r\nshould bear the name of Frontenac; their prayer was granted, and by a\r\nresolution moved on 9th May, 1879, by Mr. P. Johnson, C.C., and seconded\r\nby Alderman Rhéaume, the five kiosks of Dufferin Terrace were named\r\n_Victoria, Louise, Lorne, Frontenac, Plessis_.\r\n\r\nIt is the site of the present Normal School, adjacent to this historic\r\nspot, which has been selected for the palatial hotel in contemplation.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LAYING OF CORNER STONE OF DUFFERIN TERRACE\r\n\r\n    \"The laying of the corner stone of Dufferin Terrace took place the\r\n    same day (18th Oct., 1878) as that of the two city gates, the St.\r\n    Louis and the Kent Gate. The ceremony was performed in the presence of\r\n    thousands. His Worship the Mayor (R. Chambers) received His Excellency\r\n    the Earl of Dufferin, and with him were present many of the Aldermen\r\n    and Councillors, with the City Engineer and contractors, the members\r\n    of the Judiciary, Consul-General of Spain, Consuls of France, Belgium\r\n    and the United States, Dean Stanley, of London, England; Mrs.\r\n    Stevenson, sister to the Countess of Dufferin, Messrs.

Desbarats, W. G. Sheppard, Wm. White, Very\r\n    Revd. H. Hamel, His Lordship Judge Taschereau, late of the Supreme\r\n    Court, Hon. Judge H. Taschereau, Judge of the Superior Court, &c.\r\n\r\n    \"A handsome trowel and mallet were handed to His Excellency the\r\n    manufacture of Mr. Cyrille Duquet. On the face of the trowel a\r\n    splendid likeness of the Governor-General was embossed, and an\r\n    appropriate inscription was engraved thereon. On the plate of the\r\n    foundation stone the inscription reads as follows:--\"Dufferin\r\n    Terrace, laid by His Excellency the Earl of Dufferin, Governor-General\r\n    of the Dominion of Canada, on the 18th day of October, 1878, in\r\n    presence of the Dominion and city authorities and dignitaries, and an\r\n    immense concourse of people from all parts of Canada, also His Honor\r\n    Luc Letellier de St. Just, Lieut.-Governor of the Province of Quebec,\r\n    R.

Ellison & Co.\r\n\r\n    \"His Excellency having given the _coup de grâce_ to the foundation\r\n    stone with the silver mallet, the proceedings were closed.\"--\r\n    (_Morning Chronicle_, 19th Oct., 1878.)\r\n\r\nThe new city gate erected on the site of the old St. Louis Gate, instead\r\nof being called Dufferin Grate, as it had been contemplated, was allowed\r\nto retain its time-honored name, St. Louis Gate; the public of Quebec,\r\nhowever, were resolved that some conspicuous monument should recall to\r\nQuebecers the fragrant memory of its benefactor, Lord Dufferin; on the\r\nvisit in June, 1879, of His Excellency Lord Lorne and H.R.H. the Princess\r\nLouise, a request was made on them by the citizens, through their chief\r\nexecutive officer, the Mayor of Quebec (R. Chambers), to name and open to\r\nthe public our world-famous Terrace. On the 9th June, 1879, our\r\ndistinguished visitors performed this auspicious ceremony in presence of\r\nthousands, and in the following words confirmed the name previously\r\nentered in the Corporation records:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _INAUGURATION OF DUFFERIN TERRACE, 9th JUNE, 1879._\r\n\r\n    \"According to notice previously given, the inauguration of Dufferin\r\n    Terrace occurred at half-past two o'clock in the afternoon. When that\r\n    hour arrived a mass of people variously estimated at from eight to\r\n    fifteen thousand, but probably containing about ten thousand, occupied\r\n    the Terrace. The appearance from an elevated place of this sea of\r\n    humanity was indeed wonderful. The band pavilion in the centre of the\r\n    garden had been reserved for the Viceregal party, and was covered in\r\n    carpet and scarlet cloth, with two chairs of state. The entrance to\r\n    the pavilion was kept by the City Police, while \"B\" Battery furnished\r\n    the band and guard of honour, and played the National Anthem as the\r\n    distinguished party arrived on the field.\r\n\r\n    The Mayor and members of the City Council had previously walked in a\r\n    body to the pavilion from the City Hall, and now His Worship conducted\r\n    His Excellency and Her Royal Highness to the dais, and addressing\r\n    himself to the Governor-General, said:--\r\n\r\n    \"MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY.--On behalf of the Corporation and\r\n    citizens of Quebec, permit me to thank Your Excellency for acceding to\r\n    our request that you would be pleased to open in person this public\r\n    promenade, and also Her Royal Highness for graciously honouring us by\r\n    her presence.\r\n\r\n    \"The corner stone of this structure was laid by Your Excellency's\r\n    predecessor, the Earl of Dufferin (18th Oct., 1878).\r\n\r\n    \"It will be gratifying to the noble Lord to learn that the work in\r\n    which he took so lively an interest has been inaugurated by Your\r\n    Excellency, and that the ceremony was graced by the presence of Her\r\n    Royal Highness the Princess Louise.\r\n\r\n    \"I have, therefore, respectfully to request that Your Excellency may\r\n    be pleased to give the name which the Terrace is henceforth to bear,\r\n    and to signify if it is the pleasure of Your Excellency that it be\r\n    opened to the public.\"\r\n\r\n    His Excellency replied:--\"I am happy to accede to your request to\r\n    signify that this Terrace shall be called after your late Governor-\r\n    General, Dufferin, and that it is now open to the public.\"\r\n\r\n    Rounds of applause followed His Excellency's remarks, and loud cheers\r\n    were given for the Earl of Dufferin, Her Royal Highness and His\r\n    Excellency.\" (_Morning Chronicle_, 10th June, 1879.)\r\n\r\nParallel with Ste. Anne street, and terminated by Dauphin street, a\r\ntortuous, rugged little lane, now known as St. Andrew's street, leads past\r\nSt Andrew's schoolhouse, to the chief entrance of the Presbyterian house\r\nof worship; a church opened at the beginning of the century, repaired and\r\nrendered quite handsome a few years ago, but much damaged by fire on the\r\n30th April, 1881. In connection with the erection of this structure, a\r\ndocument was recently exhumed from the archives of the Literary and\r\nHistorical Society, which throws much light on an important section of the\r\nformer population of the city. It is a memorial to His Majesty George\r\nIII., signed at Quebec on the 5th October, 1802, by the Rev. Dr Sparks'\r\ncongregation and by himself. The first incumbent of St. Andrew's Church--\r\ncommenced in 1809, and opened for worship on the 30th November, 1810--was\r\nthe Reverend Doctor Alexander Sparks, who had landed at Quebec in 1780,\r\nbecame tutor in the family of Colonel Henry Caldwell at Belmont, St. Foye\r\nroad, and who died suddenly in Quebec, on the 7th March, 1819. Dr. Sparks\r\nhad succeeded to the Rev. George Henry, a military chaplain at the time of\r\nthe conquest; the first Presbyterian minister, we are told, who officiated\r\nin the Province, and who died on the 6th July, 1795, aged 86 years.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and forty-eight signatures are affixed to this dusty document\r\nof 1802.\r\n\r\nA carefully prepared petition--it seems--to the King, asking for a site in\r\nQuebec whereon to build a church--and suggesting that the lot occupied by\r\nthe Jesuits' Church, and where until 1878, stood the Upper Town, market\r\nshambles, be granted to the petitioners, they being without a church, and\r\nhaving to trust to the good will of the government for the use, on\r\nSundays, of a room in the Jesuits Barracks, as a place of worship.

The most notable is probably that\r\nof old Adam Lymburner, the cleverest of the three Lymburners, all\r\nmerchants at Quebec in 1775. [43] Adam, according to the historian\r\nGarneau, was more distinguished for his forensic abilities and knowledge\r\nof constitutional law, than for his robust allegiance to the Hanoverian\r\nsuccession at Quebec, when Colonel Benedict Arnold and his New Englanders\r\nso rudely knocked at our gates for admission in 1775.\r\n\r\nAccording to Garneau and other historians, in the autumn of that memorable\r\nyear, when the fate of British Canada hung as if by a thread, Adam\r\nLymburner, more prudent than loyal, retired from the sorely beset fortress\r\nto Charlesbourg, possibly to Château Bigot, a shooting box then known as\r\nthe \"Hermitage,\" to meditate on the mutability of human affairs. Later on,\r\nhowever, in the exciting times of 1791, Adam Lymburner was deputed by the\r\ncolony to England to suggest amendment's to the project of the\r\nconstitution to be promulgated by the home authorities. His able speech\r\nmay be met with in the pages of the _Canadian Review_, published at\r\nMontreal in 1826. This St Peter street magnate attained four score and ten\r\nyears, and died at Russell Square, London, on the 10th January, 1836.\r\n\r\nAnother signature recalls days of strife and alarm: that of sturdy old\r\nHugh McQuarters, the brave artillery sergeant who, at _Près-de-Ville_\r\non that momentous 31st December, 1775, applied the match to the cannon\r\nwhich consigned to a snowy shroud Brigadier-General Richard Montgomery,\r\nhis two _aides_, McPherson and Cheeseman, and his brave, but doomed\r\nfollowers, some eleven in all; the rest having sought safety in flight. By\r\nthis record, it appears Sergeant McQuarters had also a son, in 1802, one\r\nof Dr Sparks' congregation. Old Hugh McQuarters lived in Champlain street,\r\nand closed his career there in 1812.\r\n\r\nAnother autograph, that of James Thompson, one of Wolfe's comrades--\"a big\r\ngiant,\" as our old friend, the late Judge Henry Black, who knew him well,\r\nused to style him, awakens many memories of the past. Sergeant James\r\nThompson, of Fraser's Highlanders, at Louisbourg in 1758, and at Quebec in\r\n1759, came from Tain, Scotland, to Canada, as a volunteer to accompany a\r\nfriend-Capt. David Baillie, of the 78th. His athletic frame, courage,\r\nintegrity and intelligence, during the seventy-two years of his Canadian\r\ncareer, brought him employment, honour, trust and attention from every\r\nGovernor of the colony from 1759 to 1830, the period of his death, he was\r\nthen aged 98 years. At the battle of the Plains of Abraham, James\r\nThompson, as hospital sergeant, was intrusted with the landing, at Point\r\nLevi, of the wounded, who were crossed over in boats; he tells us of his\r\ncarrying some of the wounded from the crossing at Levi, up the hill, all\r\nthe way to the church at St. Joseph, converted into an hospital, and\r\ndistant three miles from the present ferry, a \"big giant\" alone could have\r\nbeen equal to such a task. In 1775, Sergeant Thompson, as overseer of\r\nGovernment works, was charged with erecting the palisades, fascines and\r\nother primitive contrivances to keep out Brother Jonathan, who had not yet\r\nlearned the use of Parrot or Gatling guns and torpedoes. Later on, we find\r\nthe sturdy Highlander an object of curiosity to strangers visiting Quebec\r\n--full of siege anecdotes and reminiscences--a welcome guest at the Château\r\nin the days of the Earl of Dalhousie. In 1827, as senior Mason, he was\r\ncalled on by His Excellency to give the three mystic taps with the mallet,\r\nwhen the corner stone of the Wolfe and Montcalm monument was laid, in the\r\npresence of Captain Young of the 79th Highlanders, and a great concourse\r\nof citizens. About New Year's day, 1776, Mr. Thompson became possessed of\r\nGen. Montgomery's sword; it has since passed to his grandson, James\r\nThompson Harrower. Mr. James Thompson left several sons, some of whose\r\nsignatures are affixed to the document before us. John Gawler was Judge\r\nfor the District of Gaspé from 1828 to 1865; George received a commission\r\nin the Royal Artillery; a third was Deputy Commissary General James\r\nThompson, who died in this city in 1869.\r\n\r\nOld James Thompson expired in 1830, at the family mansion, St. Ursule\r\nstreet, now occupied by his grandson, Mr. James Thompson Harrower.\r\n\r\nWhen we name John Greenshields, D. Munro (the partner of the Hon. Matthew\r\nBell), J. Blackwood, Matthew Lymburner, Peter Stuart, William Grant, John\r\nMure, John McNider, J. G. Hanna, John Crawford, David Stewart (the David\r\nStewart of \"Astoria\" described by Washington Irving?) James Orkney, Robert\r\nWood, Alexander Munn, James McCallum, Thomas White, Fred. Petrie, Robert\r\nRitchie, we recall many leading merchants in St. Peter street, Notre Dame\r\nstreet and the old _Cul-de-Sac_.\r\n\r\n\"Ebenezer Baird,\" we take to have been the progenitor of a well-remembered\r\nQuebec Barrister, James E. Baird, Esq., the patron of our city member,\r\nJacques Malouin, Esquire.\r\n\r\nGeorge Pyke, a Halifax barrister, had settled here. He rose to occupy a\r\nseat on the judicial bench.\r\n\r\nRobert Harrower, was doubtless the father of Messrs. Robert, David and\r\nCharles Harrower, of Trois Saumons, County of L'Islet. Honorable James\r\nIrvine, in 1818, a member of the Legislative Council, was the grandfather\r\nof the Hon. G. Irvine, of this city. The Hon. John Jones Ross, the present\r\nSpeaker of the Legislative Council, Quebec, traces back to the \"James\r\nRoss\" of 1802, and the Hon. David Alex. Ross claims for his sire that\r\nsturdy Volunteer of 1759, under Wolfe, \"John Ross,\" who made a little\r\nfortune; he resided at the house he purchased in 1765, near Palace Gate\r\nwithin. He held a commission as a Captain in the British Militia in 1775,\r\nunder Colonel Le Maitre; we can recollect his scarlet uniform which he\r\nwore in 1775, also worn in 1875, by his grandson, our worthy friend, Hon.\r\nD. A. Ross, at the ball of the Centenary of the repulse of Brigadier-\r\nGeneral Richard Montgomery, 31st December, 1775. He had three sons, David\r\nwas Solicitor-General at Quebec; John was a lawyer also, and Prothonotary\r\nat Quebec (the signer of the memorial of 1802); the third died young; of\r\nthree daughters, one was married to the Rev. Doctor Sparks, already\r\nmentioned; a second was married to Mr. James Mitchell, A.C.G., and the\r\nthird to an army surgeon. John Ross, Sr., died at an advanced age. Charles\r\nGrey Stewart, our Comptroller of Customs died in 1854; he was the father\r\nof Messrs. McLean, Charles, Alexander, Robert and John Stewart, of Mrs.\r\nWilliam Price, of Mrs. William Phillips, of the Misses Ann and Eleanor\r\nStewart.\r\n\r\n\"Joanna George\" the mother of an aged contemporary, Miss Elizabeth George,\r\nand of [44] Miss Agnes George, the widow of the late Arch. Campbell, Esq.,\r\nN.P., and grandmother of the present President of the St. Andrew's\r\nSociety, W. Darling Campbell, died about 1830.\r\n\r\n\"Maya Darling\" was another daughter, and wife of Capt. Darling. \"John\r\nBurn,\" also one of the signers of the Memorial, and who afterwards settled\r\nin Upper Canada, was the son of \"Joanna George\" by another marriage; the\r\neccentric and clever Quebec merchant, Mr. James George, was another son.\r\nHe was the first who suggested in 1822, a plan of the St. Charles River\r\nDocks--the first who took up the subject of rendering the St. Lawrence\r\nRapids navigable higher than Montreal. The idea seemed so impracticable,\r\nand what was still worse, so new, that the far-seeing Mr. George, was at\r\nthe time branded as _non compos_! and still for years the \"Spartan,\"\r\n\"Passport,\" \"Champion\" and other steamers have safely ran these rapids\r\ndaily every season!\r\n\r\nJames George had also suggested the practicability of Wooden Railways or\r\nTramways, with horses as locomotive power, forty years before the Civil\r\nEngineer Hulburt built the Gosford Wooden Railway, with steam as\r\nlocomotive power.\r\n\r\n\"William Grant, of St. Roch's, after whom Grant street was called, was\r\nmember for the Upper Town of Quebec, during our two first Parliaments,\r\nfrom 17th December, 1792, to 29th May, 1800, and from 9th January, 1805,\r\nto period of his death at St. Roch in 1805. An enterprising and important\r\npersonage was the Hon. Wm. Grant, the Receiver General of the Province in\r\n1770. He had married the widow of the third Baron de Longueuil.\r\n\r\n\"John Mure\" represented the County of York (Vaudreuil) in three\r\nParliaments, from 9th January, 1805, to 26th February, 1810, and was\r\nmember for the Upper Town of Quebec, from 1810 to 1814. A man of\r\nintelligence, he also, though a Presbyterian, became a benefactor to the\r\nR. C. Church, having, in 1812, given to the R. C. parishioners of St.\r\nRoch's, a site whereon to erect their church in that thriving suburb.\r\n\r\n\"John Blackwood\" also represented the Upper Town in two Parliaments, from\r\n9th April, 1809, to 20th February, 1810.\r\n\r\n\"Jane Sewell\" was the wife of Stephen Sewell, Solicitor-General of Lower\r\nCanada, brother to Chief Justice Sewell.\r\n\r\n\"Henrietta Sewell,\" one of the signers, survived ten years her husband,\r\nthe late Jonathan Sewell, Chief Justice for Lower Canada, who died in\r\nQuebec in 1839. Chief Justice Sewell left a numerous progeny. [45]\r\n\r\n\"William Lindsay\" was the father of the late William Burns Lindsay, for\r\nyears Clerk of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, and of our\r\nvenerable fellow-citizen, Errol Boyd Lindsay, Esq., Notary Public, now\r\nmore than four score years of age; he seems to have taken his surname from\r\nCapt. Errol Boyd, in 1798, commander of the well remembered Quebec and\r\nMontreal trader, the \"Dunlop.\"\r\n\r\n\"William Smith,\" one of the last among the signers of the memorial, the\r\nbrother of Henrietta Smith, wife of Chief Justice Sewell, was the Hon.\r\nWilliam Smith, Clerk of the Legislative Council, and who, in 1815,\r\npublished his _History of Canada_, in two volumes, a standard work;\r\nhe was a descendant of the Hon. William Smith, a noted U. E. Loyalist, who\r\nwrote the history of the State of New York, and landed at Quebec, 23rd\r\nOctober, 1786. As a reward for his loyalty he had been made Chief Justice\r\nof Lower Canada, 1st September, 1785; he died at Quebec, 6th December,\r\n1793.\r\n\r\nThe names of six signers of the _Memorial to the King_, appear on the\r\nlist of the jury empanelled to try, in 1797, before Chief Justice Osgood,\r\nDavid McLane for high treason, viz.: John Blackwood, John Crawford, David\r\nMunro, John Mure, James Irvine, James Orkney. George Pyke was the Counsel\r\nnamed _ex officio_, together with M. Franklin, to defend the misguided\r\nYankee.\r\n\r\nThe Jury stood thus;--\r\n\r\n  John Blackwood,                    James Irvine,\r\n  John Crawford,                     James Orkney,\r\n  John Painter,                      James Watson Goddard,\r\n  David Monro,                       Henry Cull,\r\n  John Mure,                         Robert Morrogh,\r\n  John Jones,                        George Symes.\r\n\r\nParloir street, well leavened with lawyers, leads to the _parloir_ of\r\nthe Ursulines. Here resided the late Judge de Bonne, at the dawn of the\r\npresent century. The locality is alive with memories of this venerable\r\nseat of education, and with saintly and heroic traditions of Madame de la\r\nPeltrie, Mère de l'Incarnation--Montcalm. \"There exists,\" says the Abbé\r\nCasgrain, \"in the Ursuline Nunnery, a small picture, which portrays a\r\ntouching tradition of the early days of Canada: a painting executed by a\r\nCanadian artist, from old etchings, preserved in the monastery. * * The\r\ncanvas represents the forest primeval, which mantled the promontory of\r\nQuebec, at the birth of the Colony. In the centre of the picture may be\r\nseen, amidst the maples and tall pines, the first monastery, founded in\r\n1641 by Madame de la Peltrie. On its front stands forth in perspective the\r\ndwelling which the founder had erected for her own use, three years later\r\non. The area comprised between these two edifices, is occupied by a\r\nclearing, surrounded by a palisade, whereon are seen grazing a flock of\r\nsheep. On the left side of the picture a broad avenue leads through the\r\nforest:--the _Grand Allée_--later on St. Louis street, which leads to\r\nthe village of Sillery. Two horsemen, habited à la Louis XIV, meet on this\r\navenue, the one Monsieur d'Ailleboust, the Governor of the Colony, the\r\nother is Monsieur DuPlessis Bochard, the Governor of Three Rivers. In the\r\nmidst of their interview, they are interrupted by an Indian Chief, who\r\noffers them a beaver skin. A few steps from her residence, Madame de la\r\nPeltrie is standing close to another Indian Chief, who, with head\r\ninclined, seems in the attitude of listening to her in the most respectful\r\nmanner, whilst she, dignified and composed, is expounding to him the\r\nsacred truths of faith. This scene presents an admirable contrast, with\r\nanother taking place close by; an Indian warrior is seen giving,\r\nimperiously, his orders to a squaw,--his wife mayhap--but who, from her\r\ndowncast and humble look, seems more like his slave. A short distance from\r\nthis group, a missionary, (Father Jérôme Lalemant) after visiting some\r\nwigwams, erected around the house of Madame de la Peltrie, is threading a\r\nnarrow path leading to the depths of the forest. The most attractive\r\nfeature about the painting is a group of young children, listening\r\nattentively to the teachings of a nun, seated on the right, under the\r\nshade of an ash tree. The impression created by this antique painting, is\r\nthe more delightful and vivid, because on turning one's gaze, at present,\r\nfrom the picture, to the interior of the cloister, may still be seen the\r\nhoary head of an old ash tree, under which tradition shows us the\r\nvenerable _Mother de l'Incarnation_, catechising the Indian children\r\nand teaching the young girls of the colony.\" [46] After more than two\r\ncenturies of existence, the old ash tree succumbed lately to a storm.\r\n\r\nLaval, Attorney-General Ruette D'Auteuil, Louis de Buade, Ste. Hélène ()\r\nseem to come back to life in the ancient streets of the same name, whilst\r\nFrontenac, Iberville, Piedmont, are brought to one's recollection, in the\r\nmodern thoroughfares. The old Scotch pilot, Abraham Martin, (who according\r\nto the _Jesuits' Journal_, might have been a bit of a scamp, although\r\na church chorister, but who does not appear to have been tried for his\r\npeccadiloes,) owned a domain of thirty-two acres of land in St. John's\r\nsuburbs, which were bounded towards the north, by the hill which now bears\r\nhis name (_La Côte d'Abraham_.)\r\n\r\nMythology has exacted a tribute on a strip of ground in the St. Louis\r\nsuburbs. The chief of the pagan Olympus boasts of his lane, \"Jupiter\r\nstreet,\" so called after a celebrated inn, Jupiter's Inn, on account of a\r\nfull sized statue of the master of Olympus which stood formerly over the\r\nmain entrance. In the beginning of the century, a mineral spring, of\r\nwondrous virtue, attracted to this neighbourhood, those of our _bon\r\nvivants_ whose livers were out of order. Its efficacy is now a thing of\r\nthe past!\r\n\r\nThat dear old street,--St. George street formerly,--now called after the\r\nfirst settler of the Upper Town in 1617, _Louis Hébert_, by the erection\r\nof the lofty Medical College and Laval University, for us has been shorn\r\nof its name--its sunshine--its glory, since the home [47] of our youth, at\r\nthe east end, has passed into strange hands. It is now _Hébert_ street, by\r\norder of the City council.\r\n\r\nOpposite to the antique and still stately dwelling, lately owned by Jos.\r\nShehyn, M.P.P., is a house formerly tenanted by Mr. J. Dyke. In the\r\nbeginning of this century it was occupied by an old countryman,\r\nremarkable, if not for deep scientific attainments, at least for shrewd\r\ncommon sense and great success in life--Mr. P. Paterson, the proprietor of\r\nthe extensive mills at Montmorency--now owned by the estate of the late\r\nGeorge Benson Hall, his son-in-law.\r\n\r\nPeter Paterson, about 1790, left Whitby, England, to seek his fortune in\r\nCanada. His skill as a ship builder--his integrity of character and\r\nbusiness habits, pointed him out as a fit agent--later on as a partner in\r\na wealthy Baltic firm of London merchants who still have representatives\r\nin the colony. At the time of Napoleon's continental blockade, the English\r\nGovernment, seeing that the Baltic was closed for the supply of timber for\r\nthe navy, gave out a large contract to Messrs. Henry and John Usborne--of\r\nLondon--for masts and oak. Usborne & Co., employed Mr. P. Paterson to\r\ndress and ship this timber. A timber limit license, of portentous import,\r\nauthorizing the cutting of oak and masts for the navy in all British North\r\nAmerica, was issued. Under authority of this license, Mr. Paterson partly\r\ndenuded the shores of Lake Champlain as well as the Thousand Islands, of\r\ntheir fine oak. Mr. Paterson was the first to float oak in rafts to\r\nQuebec. He built a large mill at Montmorency, having exchanged his St.\r\nGeorge street house for the mill site at Montmorency. His mills have since\r\nattained to great importance.\r\n\r\nIn the rear of (St. George--now) Hébert street loom out the lofty walls of\r\nthe Laval University, which received its Royal Charter in 1852. [48]\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE LAVAL UNIVERSITY._\r\n\r\nThe main edifice is 298 feet in length, five stories high; a plain,\r\nmassive structure of cut-stone, much improved in appearance since the\r\naddition, in 1876, of the present superstructure, which relieves the\r\nunbroken monotony of its form. The work is a great ornament not only to\r\nthe immense building itself, but to the city. The task of designing the\r\nsuperstructure was entrusted to the taste and talent of J. F. Peachy,\r\narchitect. The superstructure is in the French mansard roof style, with\r\nhandsome cupolas on the east and west ends, surmounted with flag-staffs\r\nand weather vanes. In the centre towers a dome far above all, surmounted\r\nby a gilt-iron cross in the modern Grecian style--the upright shaft and\r\narms being formed at four right angles. The crown ornaments on the centre\r\ntop and ends of the arms are all of wrought iron and weigh about 700 lbs.\r\nThe base is strongly braced and bolted to an oak shaft, secured to the\r\ntruss work of the dome so firmly as to resist the fiercest gale of wind or\r\nany other powerful strain. It is 11 feet six inches in height and the arms\r\nare 7 feet six inches across. Mr. Philip Whitty, iron worker and,\r\nmachinist, of St. James street, was the builder of this cross, and its\r\nhandsome design and solidity reflect credit upon his taste and\r\nworkmanship. We believe that it is intended to have a picture gallery in\r\nthe superstructure under the central dome. The entire roof is strongly\r\ntrussed and braced with iron bolts. This portion of the work was done\r\nunder the superintendence of Mr. Marcou. We understand that it is also the\r\nintention to erect two balconies on the eastern end, fronting the St.\r\nLawrence--these balconies to be supported by Corinthian columns. From the\r\nbase to the present superstructure, the building was originally 80 feet\r\nhigh; it now stands 202 feet high from the base to the top of the cross on\r\nthe central dome.\r\n\r\n    In 1880, another important addition, involving a heavy outlay, was\r\n    planned. A lofty wing, 265 feet in length has been added to this\r\n    imposing pile of buildings; it covers a large area in the seminary\r\n    garden and connects on each story with the main structure, from which\r\n    it stands out at right angles. Both buildings are intended to form but\r\n    one, and seen from Levi or from the River St. Lawrence, it looks like\r\n    an extension of the Laval University itself. The edifice is fireproof,\r\n    its internal division walls are of brick, its rafters of iron; the\r\n    floors are brick lined with deals as a preventive against dampness.\r\n    The iron rafters were wrought at Lodelinsart, near Charleroi, Belgium;\r\n    they weigh 400 tons, and cost laid down 1-1/2 cent per lb.\r\n\r\n    The basement and the ceiling of the first flat are vaulted over. The\r\n    refectory takes up a whole wing of the first story. The masonry of the\r\n    upper corridors rests on eighteen cast iron columns, weighing 3,000\r\n    lbs. each. The ceiling of the refectory is exceedingly strong and\r\n    handsome; every story, in fact, is vaulted from top to bottom.\r\n\r\n    A corridor eight feet wide and two hundred and sixty-five feet long,\r\n    intersects the centre of each story. All the vestibules, corridors and\r\n    passages are paved with ceramic square blocks brought from Belgium.\r\n\r\n    The most notable part of the structure is the main staircase, entirely\r\n    of iron and stone; it contains 120 steps 8 feet long, 16 feet broad, 5\r\n    inches high, each step hewn out of a single block. The iron material\r\n    weighs about 37,000 lbs. There is also another flight of steps made of\r\n    iron. A hydraulic elevator in the centre of the building will provide\r\n    an easy access to every story.\r\n\r\n    The roofed galleries, eight feet wide, attached to each story on the\r\n    front, present promenades and views unrivaled in the city looking\r\n    towards Levi and the Island of Orleans. On a large stone or the\r\n    loftiest part of the front wall, over the window, is inscribed--\r\n    _Conditum_, 1880.\r\n\r\n    The arch of the entrance to the Court House burnt in 1872, which, it\r\n    was said, had formed part of the old Récollet Church, destroyed by\r\n    fire on 6th Sept., 1796, has been used to build the arch of the porch\r\n    which leads from the seminary garden to the farm-yard in rear. There\r\n    are 230 windows in this new wing which has a mansard roof. It is\r\n    computed that 4,000,000 bricks have been employed in the masonry. The\r\n    architect is J. F. Peachy.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _STAFF OF THE LAVAL UNIVERSITY IN 1881._\r\n\r\n    Rector, Revd. Ed. Méthot,--Superior of Quebec Seminary.\r\n    Professor of Commercial and Maritime Law,--Hon.

Begin.\r\n\r\nOn the conspicuous site where stands the unpretending brick structure\r\nknown as our present House of Parliament, (which succeeded to the handsome\r\ncut stone edifice destroyed by fire in 1864) one might, in 1660, have seen\r\nthe dwelling of a man of note, Ruette d'Auteuil. D'Auteuil became\r\nsubsequently Attorney General and had lively times with that sturdy old\r\nruler, Count de Frontenac. Ruette d'Auteuil had sold the lot for $600\r\n(3,000 livres de 20 sols) to Major Provost, who resold it, with the two\r\nstory stone house thereon erected, for $3,000, to Bishop de St. Vallier.\r\nThe latter having bequeathed it to his ecclesiastical successor, Bishop\r\nPanet ceded it in the year 1830 to the Provincial Government for an annual\r\nground rent of £1,000--this rent is continued to the Archbishop by the\r\nProvincial Government of Quebec. No one now cares to enquire how Bishop\r\nPanet made such an excellent bargain, though a cause is assigned.\r\n\r\nPalace Street was thus denominated from its leading direct from the Upper\r\nTown to the Intendant's Palace--latterly the King's woodyard. In earlier\r\ndays it went by the name of _Rue des Pauvres_, [49] (Street of the\r\nPoor,) from its intersecting the domain of the _Hôtel Dieu_, whose\r\nrevenues were devoted to the maintenance of the poor sheltered behind its\r\nmassive old walls. Close by, on Fabrique street, Bishop de St. Vallier had\r\nfounded _le Bureau des Pauvres_, where the beggars of Quebec (a thriving\r\nclass to this day) received alms, in order to deter them from begging in\r\nthe country round the city. The success which crowned this humble retreat\r\nof the mendicant led the philanthropic Bishop to found the General\r\nHospital in the Seigneurie de Notre Dame des Anges, beyond St. Roch. He\r\nreceived there nuns of the Convents of the Ursulines and of the Hôtel Dieu\r\nand gave them the administration of the newly founded establishment,\r\nwhere, moreover, he at a more recent date resided as almoner of the poor.\r\n\r\nAt the western corner of Palace and St. John streets, has stood since\r\n1771, a well known landmark erected to replace the statue of Saint John\r\nthe Baptist, which had, under the French _régime_, adorned the corner\r\nhouse. After the surrender of Quebec to the British forces, the owners of\r\nthe house, fearing the outer barbarians might be wanting in respect to the\r\nsaint's effigy, sent it to the General Hospital, where it stood over the\r\nprincipal entrance until a few years back. They replaced it by a wooden\r\nstatue of General Wolfe, sculptured by the Brothers Cholette, at the\r\nrequest of George Hipps, a loyal butcher. The peregrinations of this\r\nhistoric relic, in 1838, from Quebec to Halifax--from Halifax to Bermuda,\r\nthence to Portsmouth, and finally to its old niche at Wolfe's corner, St.\r\nJohn Street, whilst they afforded much sport to the middies of H. M. Ship\r\n_Inconstant_, who visited our port that summer and carried away the\r\nGeneral, were the subject of several newspaper paragraphs in prose and\r\nverse.\r\n\r\nFinally, the safe return of the \"General\" with a brand new coat of paint\r\nand varnish in a deal box, consigned to His Worship, the Mayor of Quebec\r\nsent by unknown hands, was made an occasion of rejoicing to every friend\r\nof the British hero whom Quebec contained, and they were not few.\r\n\r\nSome of the actors of this practical joke, staunch upholders of\r\nBritannia's sovereignty of the sea, now pace the quarter deck, t'is said,\r\nproud and stern admirals.\r\n\r\nThe street and hill leading down from the parochial Church, (whose title\r\nwas _Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin\r\nMary_,) to the outlet, where Hope Gate was built in 1786, was called\r\nSte. Famille street from its vicinity to the Cathedral, which, as the\r\nparish church of the citizens of Quebec, was formerly called the Ste.\r\nFamille Church. On the east side, half way up the hill still exist the\r\nruins of the old homestead of the Seigneurs de Léry--in 1854, occupied by\r\nSir E. P. Taché, since, sold to the Quebec Seminary. A lofty fence on the\r\nstreet hides from view the hoary old poplar trees which of yore decked the\r\nfront of the old manor. On the opposite side, a little higher up, also\r\nsurvives the old house of Mr. Jean Langevin, father of the Bishop of\r\nRimouski, and of Sir H. L. Langevin. Here in the closing days of French\r\nDominion lived the first Acadian, who brought to Quebec the news of the\r\ndispersion of his compatriots, so eloquently sung by Longfellow, Dr.\r\nLajus, of French extraction, who settled at Quebec and married a sister of\r\nBishop Hubert. On the northern angle of this old tenement you now read\r\n\"_Ste. Famille_ street.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Stanislas street, the western boundary of the ancient estate of the\r\nJesuits--on the eastern portion of which their college was built in 1637--\r\nowes its saintly nomenclature to the learned order--no doubt desirous of\r\nhanding down to posterity an enduring souvenir of a valiant ascetic,\r\nthough youthful member of the fraternity. Its northern end reaches at\r\nright angles to Ste. Hélène street in a line with the old tenement\r\nrecently occupied by the late Narcisse Constantin Faucher, Esq.,\r\nBarrister--recently leased by the late Lieut.-Col. John Sewell, one of Sir\r\nIsaac Brock's officers at Queenstown Heights in 1812 In 1835 it was the\r\nhome of a Mrs. Montgomery. That year it was burglarized in a somewhat\r\nromantic--shall we say--humane manner by Chambers' murderous gang; the\r\naged and demure mistress of the house and her young maid servant being\r\nrolled up in the velvety pleats of the parlor carpet and deposited gently,\r\ntenderly and unharmed in the subterranean and discreet region of the\r\ncellar, so that the feelings of either should not be lacerated by the\r\nsight of the robbery going on above stairs.\r\n\r\nWho will dare assert that among the sanguinary crew who in 1836, heavily\r\nironed, bid adieu to Quebec forever, leaving their country for their\r\ncountry's good--in the British Brig _Ceres_, all bound as permanent\r\nsettlers to Van Dieman's Land--who will dare assert there was not some\r\nJack Sheppard, with a tender spot in his heart towards the youthful\r\n_Briseis_ who acknowledged Mrs. Montgomery's gentle sway.\r\n\r\nA conspicuous landmark on St. Stanislas street is Trinity Chapel.\r\n\r\nOf yore there stood in rear of the chapel the \"Theatre Royal,\" opened 15th\r\nFebruary, [50] 1832, where the Siddons, Keans and Kembles held forth to\r\nour admiring fathers. Church and theatre both owed their birth to the late\r\nChief Justice Sewell. The site of this theatre was purchased some years\r\nback by the ecclesiastical authorities of St Patrick Church. Thus\r\ndisappeared the fane once sacred to Thespis and Melpomene, its fun-loving\r\nvotaries, as such, knew it no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _TRINITY CHURCH._\r\n\r\n    The church of the \"Holy Trinity,\" St. Stanislas street, Quebec, was\r\n    erected on a site which, judging from the discovery of a skeleton,\r\n    when the foundations were laid, had been a cemetery.\r\n\r\n    The architecture of this church is Doric, and is considered correct\r\n    both internally and externally. It is a substantial building of good\r\n    proportions, 90 feet in length by 49 in breadth, is supplied with an\r\n    organ and bell. It is commodious and capable of seating 700 persons.\r\n    The sittings are free. It contains a beautiful marble monument, by\r\n    Manning, of London, which was erected to the memory of the late Hon.\r\n    Jonathan Sewell, LL.D., the founder of the church, also a few other\r\n    tablets in memory of different members of the family of Sewell. The\r\n    present incumbent and proprietor is the Rev. Edmund Willoughby Sewell,\r\n    M.A., but it is confidently expected that ere long it will pass into\r\n    the hands of an incorporated body, with whom the future presentment of\r\n    the officiating clergyman will rest.\r\n\r\n    On a tin-plate on the corner-stone of the chapel, the following\r\n    inscription occurs:\r\n\r\n        \"Quebec, 15th September, 1824.\r\n\r\n        On Thursday was deposited in a private manner, under a stone at\r\n        the north-east angle of the new Chapel of Ease to the English\r\n        Cathedral, a tin plate having the following Latin inscription:\r\n\r\n        Anno Dm.

Anne street, past the old jail, which dated from\r\n1810. Lugubrious memories crowd round this massive tolbooth--of which the\r\nonly traces of the past are some vaulted lock-up or cells beneath the\r\nrooms of the Literary and Historical Society, one of which, provided with\r\na solid new iron door, is set apart for the reception of the priceless\r\nM.S.S. of the society. The oak flooring of the passages to the cells\r\nexhibit many initials, telling a tale of more than one guilty life--of\r\nremorse--let us hope, of repentance.\r\n\r\nThe narrow door in the wall and the iron balcony, over the chief entrance\r\nleading formerly to the fatal drop which cut short the earthly career of\r\nthe assassin or burglar [51] was speedily removed when the directors of\r\nthe Morrin College in 1870 purchased the building from Government to\r\nlocate permanently the seat of learning due to the munificence of the late\r\nJoseph Morrin, M.D.\r\n\r\nThe once familiar inscription above the prison door, the rendering of\r\nwhich in English was a favourite amusement to many of the juniors of the\r\nHigh School, or Seminary, on their way to class, that also has\r\ndisappeared:\r\n\r\n  \"_Carcer iste bonos a pravis vindicare possit_!\"\r\n  May this prison teach the wicked for the edification of the good.\"\r\n\r\nThe damp, vaulted cells in the basement, where the condemned felon in\r\nsilence awaited his doom, or the airy wards above, where the impecunious\r\ndebtor or the runaway sailor meditatively or riotously defied their\r\ntraditional enemies the constable and policeman, now echo the Hebrew,\r\nGreek and Latin utterances of the Morrin College professors, and on\r\nmeeting nights the disquisitions before the Literary and Historical\r\nSociety, of lecturers on Canadian history, literature or art.\r\n\r\nIt is the glory and privilege of the latter institution in accordance with\r\nthe object of its Royal Charter, to offer to citizens of all creeds and\r\nnationalities, a neutral ground, sacred to intellectual pursuits. It dates\r\nback to 1823, when His Excellency, George Ramsay, Earl of Dalhousie,\r\nassisted by the late Dr. John Charlton Fisher, LL.D., and ex-editor of the\r\nNew York _Albion_, successfully matured a long meditated plan to promote\r\nthe study of history and of literature. The Literary and Historical\r\nSociety held its first meeting in the _Château St. Louis_. It is curious\r\nto glance over the list of names in its charter. [52] It contained the\r\nleading men on the Bench, in the professions, and in the city. In 1832 the\r\nlibrary and museum occupied a large room in the Union building facing the\r\nRing. From thence they were transferred to the upper story of the\r\nParliament Buildings, on Mountain Hill, where a portion of both was\r\ndestroyed by the conflagration which burnt down the stately cut-stone\r\nedifice in 1854, with the stone of which in 1860, the Champlain Market\r\nHall was built. What was saved of the library and museum was transferred\r\nto apartments in St Louis street, then owned by the late George Henderson,\r\nJ.P. [53] The next removal, about 1860, brought the institution to Masonic\r\nHall, corner of Garden and St. Louis streets. Here, also, the fire-fiend\r\nassailed the treasures of knowledge and specimens of natural history, of\r\nthe society, which, with its household gods, flitted down to a suite of\r\nrooms above the savings bank apartments in St. John Street, from whence,\r\nabout 1870, it issued to become an annual tenant in the north wing of the\r\nMorrin College, where it has flourished ever since.\r\n\r\nIn the protracted and chequered existence of this pioneer among Canadian\r\nliterary associations, one day, above all others is likely from the\r\npreparations--pageant and speeches which marked it, to be long remembered\r\namong Quebecers as a red letter day in the annals of the society. The\r\ncelebration in December, 1875 of the centennial of the repulse of\r\nBrigadier General Richard Montgomery and Colonel Benedict Arnold, who, at\r\ndawn on the 31st December, 1775, attempted to take the old fortress by\r\nstorm. The first, with a number of his followers, met with his death at\r\nPrès-de-Ville, in Champlain street; the other was carried wounded in the\r\nknee, to the General Hospital, St. Roch's suburbs, whilst 427 of his\r\ncommand were taken prisoners of war and incarcerated until September\r\nfollowing in the Quebec Seminary, the Récollet Convent and the Dauphin\r\nPrison, since destroyed, but then existing, a little north of St. John's\r\nGate, inside. The worthy commander of the \"B\" Battery, Lieut.-Col. T. B.\r\nStrange, R.A., then stationed at the Citadel of Quebec, having consented to\r\nnarrate the incidents which marked the attack of Brigadier General Richard\r\nMontgomery at Près-de-Ville (which we reserve for another page,) the\r\ndescription of Col. Benedict Arnold's assault on the Sault-au-Matelot\r\nbarriers, was, left to ourselves. We subjoin a portion of the address\r\ndelivered by us at this memorable centenary. It embodies an important\r\nincident of Quebec history:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _ARNOLD'S ASSAULT ON SAULT-AU-MATELOT BARRIERS._\r\n\r\n    MR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\n    \"The event which we intend commemorating this evening, is one at\r\n    peculiar interest to us as Canadians, and more especially so to us as\r\n    Quebecers, the narrow, I may say, the providential escape of the whole\r\n    Province from foreign subjugation one century ago. It is less a\r\n    chapter of Canadian annals I purpose to read to you this night, than\r\n    some minute details little known, and gleaned from the journals left\r\n    by eye witnesses of the thrilling hand to hand fight which took place\r\n    a few hundred yards from where you sit, under our walls, on the 31st\r\n    December, 1775, between Col. Arnold's New England soldiery and our own\r\n    garrison.\r\n\r\n    Possibly, you may not all realize the critical position of the city on\r\n    that memorable morning. Next day, a Sunday, ushered in the new year.\r\n    Think you there was much \"visiting,\" much festivity, on that new\r\n    year's day? alas! though victory crowned our banner, there was\r\n    mourning in too many Canadian homes; we, too, had to bury our dead.\r\n\r\n    Let us take a rapid glimpse of what had proceeded the assault.\r\n\r\n    Two formidable parties, under experienced leaders, in execution of the\r\n    campaign planned by George Washington and our former Deputy Post\r\n    Master General, the able Benjamin Franklin, had united under the walls\r\n    of Quebec. Both leaders intimately knew its highways and by-ways.\r\n    Brigadier General Richard Montgomery, before settling near New York,\r\n    had held a lieutenant's commission in His Britannic Majesty's 17th\r\n    Foot, had taken part in the war of the conquest, in 1759, and had\r\n    visited Quebec. Col. Benedict Arnold, attracted by the fame of our\r\n    Norman horses, had more than once been in the city with the object of\r\n    trading in them.\r\n\r\n    Benedict Arnold was indeed a daring commander. His successful journey\r\n    through trackless forests between Cambridge and Quebec--his descent in\r\n    boats through rivers choked with ice, and through dangerous rapids;\r\n    the cold, hunger and exposure endured by himself and his soldiers,\r\n    were feats of endurance of which any nation might justly feel proud.\r\n\r\n    Major-General Sir James Carmichael Smyth, a high authority on such\r\n    matters, says of this winter campaign: \"It is, perhaps, one of the\r\n    most wonderful instances of perseverance and spirit upon record.\" So\r\n    much for the endurance and bravery of our foes. I am compelled to pass\r\n    unnoticed many important incidents of the campaign in order to reach\r\n    sooner the main facts.\r\n\r\n    What was the real state of the Colony on that identical 31st December,\r\n    one hundred years ago? Why, it was simply desperate. The wave of\r\n    invasion had surged over our border. Fort after fort, city after city,\r\n    had capitulated--Ticonderoga, Crown Point, Fort St. John, Fort\r\n    Chambly, Montreal, Sorel, Three Rivers. Montgomery with his victorious\r\n    bands had borne everything before him like a tornado. The Canadian\r\n    peasantry dreaded the very sight of warriors who must be ball-proof,\r\n    as they were supposed, by a curious mistake, to be \"incased in plate-\r\n    iron,\" _vêtus de tole_, instead _de toile_. [54] The red [54a] and\r\n    black flag of successful rebellion floated over the suburbs of Quebec.\r\n    Morgan's and Humphries' riflemen were thundering at the very gates of\r\n    the city, those dear old walls--(loud applause)--which some Vandals\r\n    are longing to demolish, alone kept away the wolf.\r\n\r\n    Levi, Sillery, Ste Foye, Lorette, Charlesbourg, the Island of Orleans,\r\n    Beauport and every inch of British territory around the city were in\r\n    possession of the invaders, every house in the suburbs sheltered an\r\n    enemy--every bush in the country might conceal a deadly foe. Treachery\r\n    stalked within the camp--disaffection was busy inside and outside of\r\n    the walls. At first many of the citizens, English as well as French,\r\n    seemed disinclined to take part in the great family quarrel which had\r\n    originated at Boston--the British of New England pitted against the\r\n    British of Canada. The confusion of ideas and opinions must at first\r\n    have been great. Several old British officers who had served in the\r\n    wars of the conquest of Canada, had turned their swords against their\r\n    old messmates--their brothers-in-arms--amongst others, Richard\r\n    Montgomery, Moses Hazen and Donald Campbell. Quebec, denuded of its\r\n    regulars, had indeed a most gloomy prospect to look upon. No soldiers\r\n    to man her walls except her citizens unaccustomed to warfare--no\r\n    succour to expect from England till the following spring--scantiness\r\n    of provisions and a terrified peasantry who had not the power, often\r\n    no desire, to penetrate into the beleaguered city during winter.\r\n\r\n    Were not these trying times for our worthy sires?\r\n\r\n    Such was the posture of affairs, when to the general joy, our gallant\r\n    Governor Guy Carleton, returned and rejoined his dauntless little army\r\n    at Quebec, having succeeded, thanks to Captain Bouchette and other\r\n    brave men, in eluding the vigilance of the enemy in possession of\r\n    Three Rivers, Sorel and Montreal. Turn over the records of those days\r\n    and yon will see the importance our fathers attached to the results of\r\n    the Sault-au-Matelot and Près-de-Ville engagements.\r\n\r\n    For more than twenty-five years, the 31st December, 1775, was annually\r\n    commemorated, generally by a club dinner given at Ferguson's Hotel,\r\n    (Freemasons' Hall?) or at some other hotel of note--sometimes a\r\n    Château ball was added by the Governor of the Province. In 1778, we\r\n    find in the old _Quebec Gazette_, a grand _fête champêtre_, given by\r\n    Lady Maria Carleton and her gallant partner Sir Guy, at the Red House,\r\n    a fashionable rustic Hostelry, kept by Alex. Menut, the prince of\r\n    Canadian _Soyers_ of those days, who had been _Maître d'Hôtel_ to\r\n    General Murray, and selected that year by Their Excellencies. It stood\r\n    on the Little River road, (the land is now owned by Mr. Tozer) about\r\n    two miles from Quebec. It reads thus in the _Gazette_ of 8th January,\r\n    1778:\r\n\r\n    Quebec, 8th January, 1778._\r\n\r\n    \"Yesterday, seventh night, being the anniversary of the victory\r\n    obtained over the Rebels in their attack upon this City in the year\r\n    1775, a most elegant Ball and Supper were given at Menut's Tavern by\r\n    the Gentlemen who served in the Garrison during that Memorable Winter.\r\n    The Company, consisting of upwards of two hundred and thirty Ladies\r\n    and Gentlemen, made a grand and brilliant appearance, and nothing but\r\n    mirth and good humour reigned all night long. About half-past six, His\r\n    Excellency, Sir Guy Carleton, Knight of the Bath, our worthy Governor\r\n    and Successful General, dressed in the militia uniform, (which added\r\n    lustre to the Ribbon and Star) as were also all the gentlemen of that\r\n    corps who served under him during the siege, entered the assembly room\r\n    accompanied by Lady Maria, &c., &c., and the Ball was soon opened by\r\n    her Ladyship and the Honorable Henry Caldwell, Lieutenant Colonel\r\n    Commandant of the British Militia. The dancing continued until half-\r\n    past twelve, when the Ladies were conducted into the supper room,\r\n    where Mr. Menut exhibited fresh proofs of that superior excellence in\r\n    the _culinary_ art he so justly claims above his Peers.... The\r\n    company in general broke up about four in the morning, highly\r\n    satisfied with their entertainment and in perfect good humour with one\r\n    another. May that disposition prevail until the next and every\r\n    succeeding 31st of December, and may each return of that glorious day\r\n    (the event of which was not only the preservation of this garrison;\r\n    but of the whole Province) be commemorated with the same spirit and\r\n    unanimity in grateful remembrance of our happy deliverance from the\r\n    snares of the enemy, and with grateful acknowledgements of those\r\n    blessings of peace and tranquility of Government and Laws we now enjoy\r\n    in consequence of that day's success.\"\r\n\r\n    The _Gazette_ of the following year carefully chronicles the gathering\r\n    of the Veterans of 1775.--\"Thursday last being the anniversary of the\r\n    31st December, a Day which will be ever famous in the annals of this\r\n    country for the defeat of Faction and Rebellion, the same was observed\r\n    with the utmost festivity In the evening a ball and cold Collation was\r\n    given by the gentlemen who composed the Garrison in the winter of\r\n    1775, to His Excellency and a numerous and brilliant assembly of\r\n    Ladies and Gentlemen, the satisfaction every one felt in Commemorating\r\n    so Glorious an event, strongly appeared by the joy which was visible\r\n    in every contenance.\"\r\n\r\n    In 1790, according to the _Quebec Herald_, the annual dinner was\r\n    held at the _Merchant's Coffee House_, by about 30 survivors of\r\n    the Veterans, who agreed to meet twice a year, instead of once, their\r\n    joviality apparently increasing with their age.\r\n\r\n    In 1794, [55] the _Gazette_ acquaints us that the Anniversary\r\n    Dinner was to be held at Ferguson's Hotel, on the 6th May. [56] We\r\n    find both nationalities fraternising in these loyal demonstrations. M.\r\n    DeBonne (afterwards Judge DeBonne) taking his place next to loyal John\r\n    Coffin, of Près-de-Ville fame, and probably Simon Fraser and the Hon.\r\n    Hugh Finlay, will join Lieutenant Dambourgès and Col Dupré, in\r\n    toasting King George III. under the approving eye of Lt. Col.\r\n    Caldwell, Wolfe's Deputy Quarter-Master General. Col. Caldwell, lived\r\n    to a green old age, and expired in this city in 1810. Our esteemed\r\n    fellow-citizen, Errol Boyd Lindsay, remembers him well, and in front\r\n    of whom I stand, a stalwart Volunteer of 1837, Col. Gugy, is now\r\n    relating how when a lad he once dined with Col. Caldwell, some seventy\r\n    years ago, at Belmont, amidst excellent cheer.\r\n\r\n    The _Quebec Gazette_ teems with loyal English and French songs of\r\n    1775, for a quarter of a century, and for more than twenty-five years\r\n    the anniversary banquet, ball or dinner was religiously kept up.\r\n\r\n    But we must hie away from these \"junketings\"--these festive boards,\r\n    which our loyal ancestors seem to have infinitely enjoyed. We must hie\r\n    away the long wished for \"snow storm,\" the signal of attack has come.\r\n    'Tis five o'clock before dawn. Hark to the rattle of the alarm drum.\r\n    Hark! Hark to the tolling of every city bell (and you know Quebec\r\n    bells are numerous) louder! louder even than the voice of the easterly\r\n    storm. To ARMS! To ARMS! resounds in the Market Place--the _Place\r\n    d'Armes_--and in the streets of our slumbering city.\r\n\r\n    Instead of giving you my views on the attack, I shall summon from the\r\n    silent, the meditative past, one of the stirring actors in this\r\n    thrilling encounter, an intrepid and youthful Volunteer, under Arnold,\r\n    then aged seventeen years, John Joseph Henry. He will tell you how his\r\n    countrymen attacked us:\r\n\r\n        \"It was not,\" says Judge Henry, \"until the night of the 31st\r\n        December, 1775, that such kind of weather ensued as was considered\r\n        favorable for the assault. The fore part of the night was\r\n        admirably enlightened by a luminous moon. Many of us, officers as\r\n        well as privates, had dispersed in various directions among the\r\n        farm and tippling houses of the vicinity. We well knew the signal\r\n        for rallying. This was no other than a \"snow storm.\" About 12\r\n        o'clock, P.M., the heaven was overcast. We repaired to quarters.\r\n        By 2 o'clock we were accoutred and began our march. The storm was\r\n        outrageous, and the cold wind extremely biting. In this northern\r\n        country the snow is blown horizontally into the faces of the\r\n        travellers on most occasions--this was our case.\r\n\r\n        When we came to Craig's house, near Palace Gate, a horrible roar\r\n        of cannon took place, and a ringing of all the bells of the city,\r\n        which are very numerous, and of all sizes. Arnold, leading the\r\n        forlorn hope, advanced, perhaps, one hundred yards, before the\r\n        main body. After these followed Lamb's artillerists. Morgan's\r\n        company led in the secondary part of the column of infantry.\r\n        Smith's followed, headed by Steele, the Captain from particular\r\n        causes being absent. Hendrick's company succeeded and the eastern\r\n        men so far as known to me, followed in due order. The snow was\r\n        deeper than in the fields, because of the nature of the ground.\r\n        The path made by Arnold, Lamb, and Morgan was almost\r\n        imperceptible, because of the falling snow. Covering the locks of\r\n        our guns, with the lappets of our coats, holding down our heads\r\n        (for it was impossible to bear up our faces against the imperious\r\n        storm of wind and snow), we ran, along the foot of the hill in\r\n        single file. Along the first of our run, from Palace Gate, for\r\n        several hundred paces, there stood a range of insulated buildings,\r\n        which seemed to be store-houses, we passed these quickly in single\r\n        file, pretty wide apart. The interstices were from thirty to fifty\r\n        yards. In these intervals, we received a tremendous fire of\r\n        musketry from the ramparts above us. Here we lost some brave men,\r\n        when powerless to return the salutes we received, as the enemy was\r\n        covered by his impregnable defences. They were even sightless to\r\n        us, we could see nothing but the blaze from the muzzles of their\r\n        muskets.\r\n\r\n        A number of vessels of various sizes lay along the beach, moored\r\n        by their hawsers or cables to the houses. Passing after my leader,\r\n        Lieutenant Steele, at a great rate, one of those ropes took me\r\n        under the chin, and cast me head long down, a declivity of at\r\n        least fifteen feet. The place appeared to be either a dry-dock or\r\n        a saw-pit. My descent was terrible, gun and all was involved in a\r\n        great depth of snow. Most unluckily, however, one of my knees\r\n        received a violent contusion on a piece of scraggy ice, which was\r\n        covered by the snow. On like occasions, we can scarcely expect, in\r\n        the hurry of attack, that our intimates should attend to any other\r\n        than their own concern.  Mine went from me, regardless of my fate.\r\n        Scrambling out of the cavity, without assistance, divesting my\r\n        person and gun of the snow, and limping into the line, I attempted\r\n        to assume a station and preserve it. These were none of my\r\n        friends--they knew me not. I had not gone twenty yards, in my\r\n        hobbling gait, before I was thrown out, and compelled to await the\r\n        arrival of a chasm in the line, when a new place might be\r\n        obtained. Men in affairs such as this, seem in the main, to lose\r\n        the compassionate feeling, and are averse from being dislodged\r\n        from their original stations. We proceeded rapidly, exposed to a\r\n        long line of fire from the garrison, for now we were unprotected\r\n        by any buildings. The fire had slackened in a small degree. The\r\n        enemy had been partly called off to resist the General, and\r\n        strengthen the party opposed to Arnold in our front. Now we saw\r\n        Colonel Arnold returning, wounded in the leg, and supported by two\r\n        gentlemen; a parson, Spring, was one, and, in my belief, a Mr.\r\n        Ogden, the other. Arnold called on the troops, in a cheering\r\n        voice, as we passed, urging us forward, yet it was observable\r\n        among the soldiery, with whom it was my misfortune to be now\r\n        placed, that the Colonel's retiring damped their spirits. A cant\r\n        term \"We are sold,\" was repeatedly heard in many parts throughout\r\n        the line. Thus proceeding, enfiladed by an animated but lessened\r\n        fire, we came to the first barrier, where Arnold had been wounded\r\n        in the onset. This contest had lasted but a few minutes, and was\r\n        somewhat severe, but the energy of our men prevailed. The\r\n        embrasures were entered when the enemy were discharging their\r\n        guns. The guard, consisting of thirty persons, were, either taken\r\n        or fled, leaving their arms behind them. At this time it was\r\n        discovered that our guns were useless, because of the dampness.\r\n        The snow which lodged in our fleecy coats was melted by the warmth\r\n        of our bodies. Thence came that disaster. Many of the party,\r\n        knowing the circumstance, threw aside their own, and seized the\r\n        British arms. These were not only elegant, but were such as\r\n        befitted the hand of a real soldier. It was said, that ten\r\n        thousand stand of such arms had been received from England, in the\r\n        previous summer, for arming the Canadian militia. These people\r\n        were loath to bear them in opposition to our rights. From the\r\n        first barrier to the second, there was a circular course along the\r\n        sides of houses, and partly through a street, probably of three\r\n        hundred yards or more. This second barrier was erected across and\r\n        near the mouth of a narrow street, adjacent to the foot of the\r\n        hill, which opened into a larger, leading soon into the main body\r\n        of the Lower Town. Here it was, that the most serious contention\r\n        took place: this became the bone of strife. The admirable\r\n        Montgomery, by this time, (though it was unknown to us) was no\r\n        more; yet, we expected momentarily to join him. The firing on that\r\n        side of the fortress ceased, his division fell under the command\r\n        of a Colonel Campbell, of the New York line, a worthless chief,\r\n        who retreated, without making an effort, in pursuance of the\r\n        general's original plans. The inevitable consequence was, that the\r\n        whole of the forces on that side of the city, and those who were\r\n        opposed to the dastardly persons employed to make the false\r\n        attacks, embodied and came down to oppose our division. Here was\r\n        sharp-shooting. We were on the disadvantageous side of the\r\n        barrier, for such a purpose. Confined in a narrow street, hardly\r\n        more than twenty feet wide, and on the lower ground, scarcely a\r\n        ball, well aimed or otherwise, but must take effect upon us.\r\n        Morgan, Hendricks, Steele, Humphrey's, and a crowd of every class\r\n        of the army, had gathered into the narrow pass, attempting to\r\n        surmount the barrier, which was about twelve or more feet high,\r\n        and so strongly constructed, that nothing but artillery, could\r\n        effectuate its destruction. There was a construction, fifteen or\r\n        twenty yards within the barrier, upon a rising grounde, the cannon\r\n        of which much overtopped the height of the barrier, hence, we were\r\n        assailed by grape shot in abundance. This erection we called the\r\n        platform. Again, within the barrier, and close into it, were two\r\n        ranges of musketeers, armed with musket and bayonet, ready to\r\n        receive those who might venture the dangerous leap. Add to all\r\n        this, that the enemy occupied the upper chambers of the houses, in\r\n        the interior of the barrier, on both sides of the street, from the\r\n        windows of which we became fair marks. The enemy, having the\r\n        advantage of the ground in front, a vast superiority of numbers,\r\n        dry and better arms, gave them an irresistible power, in so narrow\r\n        a space. Humphreys, upon a mound, which was speedily erected,\r\n        attended by many brave men, attempted to scale the barrier, but\r\n        was compelled to retreat, by the formidable phalanx of bayonets\r\n        within, and the weight of fire from the platform and the\r\n        buildings. Morgan, brave to temerity, stormed and raged;\r\n        Hendricks, Steele, Nichols, Humphreys, equally brave, were sedate,\r\n        though under a tremendous fire. The platform, which was within our\r\n        view, was evacuated by the accuracy of our fire, and few persons\r\n        dared venture there again. Now it was, that the necessity of\r\n        occupancy of the houses, on our side of the barrier, became\r\n        apparent. Orders were given by Morgan to that effect. We entered.\r\n        This was near day-light. The houses were a shelter, from which we\r\n        might fire with much accuracy. Yet, even here, some valuable lives\r\n        were lost. Hendricks, when aiming his rifle at some prominent\r\n        person, died by a straggling ball through his heart. He staggered\r\n        a few feet backwards, and fell upon a bed, where he instantly\r\n        expired. He was an ornament of our little society. The amiable\r\n        Humphreys died by a like kind of wound, but it was in the street,\r\n        before we entered the buildings. Many other brave men fell at this\r\n        place; among these were Lieutenant Cooper, of Connecticut, and\r\n        perhaps fifty or sixty noncommissioned officers and privates. The\r\n        wounded were numerous, and many of them dangerously so. Captain\r\n        Lamb, of the York artillerists; had nearly one-half of his face\r\n        carried away, by a grape or canister shot. My friend Steele lost\r\n        three of his fingers, as he was presenting his gun to fire;\r\n        Captain Hubbard and Lieutenant Fisdle, were all among the wounded.\r\n        When we reflect upon the whole of the dangers of this barricade,\r\n        and the formidable force that came to annoy us, it is a matter of\r\n        surprise that so many should escape death and wounding as did. All\r\n        hope of success having vanished, a retreat was contemplated, but\r\n        hesitation, uncertainty, and a lassitude of mind, which generally\r\n        takes place in the affairs of men, when we fail in a project, upon\r\n        which we have attached much expectation, now followed. The moment\r\n        was foolishly lost, when such a movement might have been made with\r\n        tolerable success. Captain Laws, at the head of two hundred men,\r\n        issuing from Palace Gate, most fairly and handsomely cooped us up.\r\n        Many of the men, aware of the consequences, and all our Indians\r\n        and Canadians (except Natanis [57] and another,) escaped across\r\n        the ice, which covered the Bay of St. Charles, before the arrival\r\n        of Captain Laws. This was a dangerous and desperate adventure, but\r\n        worth while the undertaking, in avoidance of our subsequent\r\n        sufferings. Its desperateness consisted in running two miles\r\n        across shoal ice, thrown up by the high tides of this latitude--\r\n        and its danger, in the meeting with air holes, deceptively covered\r\n        by the bed of snow. Speaking circumspectly, yet it must be\r\n        admitted conjecturally, it seems to me, that in the whole of the\r\n        attack, of commissioned officers, we had six killed, five wounded,\r\n        and of non-commissioned and privates, at least one hundred and\r\n        fifty killed, and fifty or sixty wounded. Of the enemy, many were\r\n        killed and many more wounded, comparatively, than on our side,\r\n        taking into view the disadvantages we laboured under; and that but\r\n        two occasions happened when we could return their fire, that is,\r\n        at the first and second barriers. Neither the American account of\r\n        this affair, as published by Congress, nor that of Sir Guy\r\n        Carleton, admit the loss of either side to be so great as it\r\n        really was, in my estimation * * * * * as to the British, on the\r\n        platform they were fair objects to us. They were soon driven\r\n        thence by the acuteness of our shooting. * * * *\r\n\r\n        Perhaps there never was a body of men associated, who better\r\n        understood the use and manner of employing a rifle, than our\r\n        corps; while by this time of the attack, they had their guns in\r\n        good order. When we took possession of the houses, we had a great\r\n        range. Our opportunities to kill, were enlarged. Within one\r\n        hundred yards, every man must die. The British however were at\r\n        home--they could easily drag their dead out of sight, and bear\r\n        their wounded to the Hospital. It was the reverse with us. Captain\r\n        Prentis, who commanded the provost guards, would tell me of seven\r\n        or eight killed, and fifteen or twenty wounded; opposed to this\r\n        the sentries, (who were generally Irishmen, that guarded us with\r\n        much simplicity, if not honesty,) frequently admitted of forty or\r\n        fifty killed, and many more wounded. The latter assertions\r\n        accorded with my opinion. The reasons for this belief are these:\r\n        when the dead, on the following days, were transported on the\r\n        carioles which passed our habitation for deposition in the \"dead\r\n        house,\" we observed many bodies, of which none of us had any\r\n        knowledge; and again when our wounded were returned to us from the\r\n        hospital, they uniformly spoke of being surrounded there, in its\r\n        many characters, by many of the wounded of the enemy. To the great\r\n        honor of General Carleton, they were all, whether friends or\r\n        enemies, treated with like attention.\"\r\n\r\n    The Continentals of Brigadier-General Montgomery had settled on the\r\n    following plan of attack:--Col Livingston, with his three hundred\r\n    Canadians and Major Brown, was to simulate an attack on the western\r\n    portion of the walls--Montgomery to come from Holland House down by\r\n    Wolfe's Cove, creep along the narrow path close to the St. Lawrence\r\n    and meet Arnold on his way from the General Hospital at the foot of\r\n    Mountain Hill, and then ascend to Upper Town.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant _fête littéraire_ held by the Literary and Historical\r\nSociety to commemorate the event was thus noticed in the _Morning\r\nChronicle_ of Dec 30th, 1875:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THE LITERARY AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY'S CENTENARY FÊTE._\r\n\r\n    It would be hardly possible to imagine a more graceful or unique\r\n    gathering than that which assembled in the rooms of the Literary and\r\n    Historical Society last evening, for the purpose of celebrating with\r\n    all possible _éclat_ that gloriously memorable event, the repulse\r\n    of the troops commanded by General Richard Montgomery, of the American\r\n    Army, whilom officer of the 17th Regiment of Infantry in the service\r\n    of his Britannic Majesty George III, who on the blusterous wintry\r\n    morning of the 31st December, 1775, attempted an assault upon the\r\n    redoubts and fortifications which at that time did the duty of our\r\n    present Citadel, and whose intrepidity was rewarded with a soldier's\r\n    death, and his want of success formed the nucleus of the power which\r\n    is so firmly established in this Royal Canada of ours to day.\r\n\r\n    The arrangements made by the Society for the reception of their\r\n    unusually numerous guests and the decorations of the various\r\n    apartments, were all that could be wished--commodious and tasteful. In\r\n    the entrance hall the Royal standard floated, and there the B. Battery\r\n    Band was placed. Turning up the left hand flight of steps the visitor\r\n    --passing the large class room of Morrin College, transformed for the\r\n    nonce into spacious refreshment buffets--was ushered into the lecture\r\n    room, from the galleries of which flags of many nations and many\r\n    colours were drooping. The raised dais, occupied during the delivery\r\n    of the addresses by James Stevenson, Esq., Senior Vice-President, L. &\r\n    H. Society, in the chair; Lieut.-Col. Bland Strange, R. S. M.\r\n    Bouchette, Esq., Dr. Boswell, Vice-Presidents, J. M. LeMoine, Esq.,\r\n    and Commander Ashe, R.N., ex-Presidents, was flanked on either side\r\n    with the blue and silver banners of St. Andrew's Society, bearing the\r\n    arms and escutcheon of Scotia, and their proud motto \"_Nemo me\r\n    impune lascessit_.\" Bunting and fresh spruce foliage gave an air of\r\n    freshness to all the adornable parts of the room. Immediately opposite\r\n    the lectern, which was illuminated with wax candles, placed in last\r\n    century candlesticks, and attached to the gallery railings, was a fine\r\n    collection of Lochaber axes, clustered around a genuine wooden Gaelic\r\n    shield studded with polished knobs of glittering brass. Long before\r\n    the hour of eight the company had increased to such an extent that the\r\n    room was crowded to the doors, but not inconveniently as the\r\n    ventilation was unexceptionable. With accustomed punctuality, James\r\n    Stevenson, Esq., acting in the absence of the President, opened the\r\n    meeting with some highly appropriate remarks relative to the\r\n    historical value of the subjects about to be discussed and summarising\r\n    very succinctly the events immediately previous to the beleaguering of\r\n    the fortress city. He alluded in stirring terms to the devotion which\r\n    had been manifested by the British and French defenders, who resolved\r\n    rather to be buried in the ruins than surrender the city. He stated\r\n    that he thought it especially meet and proper that the Literary and\r\n    Historical Society here should have taken up the matter and dealt with\r\n    it in this way. He alluded in eulogistic terms to the capability of\r\n    the gentlemen about to address them and, after regretting the\r\n    unavoidable absence of Lt-Col. Coffin, a lineal descendant of an\r\n    officer present, formally introduced the first speaker, Lieutenant-\r\n    Colonel Strange, commandant of Quebec Garrison, and Dominion Inspector\r\n    of Artillery. This gallant officer, who on rising was received with\r\n    loud and hearty cheering by the audience, plunged with characteristic\r\n    military brevity _in medias res_, simply remarking, at the outset,\r\n    that he, in such a position, was but a rear rank man, while Colonel\r\n    Coffin would have been a front-ranker; but his soldierly duty was\r\n    to fill that position in the absence of him to whom the task would\r\n    have been officially assigned. The subject which formed a distinct\r\n    section of the major topic of the evening was then taken up. Inasmuch\r\n    as it is our intention, and we believe that of the Society, to\r\n    reproduce faithfully in pamphlet form the graphic, interesting and\r\n    detailed word-pictures of the ever memorable events of the 31st\r\n    December, 1775, as given by the learned and competent gentlemen who\r\n    addressed the meeting, it suffices to say in the present brief notice\r\n    of the proceedings that Colonel Strange exhaustively treated that\r\n    portion which referred to the attack and defence at Pres-de-Ville--the\r\n    place in the vicinity of which now stands the extensive wharves of the\r\n    Allan Company. Many incidents of the siege, utterly unknown to\r\n    ordinary readers of history were recalled last night, and many things\r\n    that have hitherto been dubious, or apparently unaccountable explained\r\n    away. The story of the finding of the snow-covered and hard-frozen\r\n    corpse of the unfortunate General and his Aide-de-Camp, was told with\r\n    much pathos, as were details of his burial. The references to\r\n    descendants of then existing families still residents in Quebec, were\r\n    extremely interesting, because many were among the audience. At the\r\n    conclusion of Colonel Strange's admirable resumé, and some further\r\n    pointed remarks from the Chairman, Mr. J. M. LeMoine, who is _par\r\n    excellence_ and _par assiduité_ our Quebec historian, whose life has\r\n    been mainly devoted to compilation of antiquarian data touching the\r\n    walls, the streets, the relics, the families, the very Flora, and\r\n    Fauna of our cherished Stadacona--commenced his erudite and amusing\r\n    sketches of the day, taken from the stand point of the enemy's\r\n    headquarters, and the fray in the Sault-au-Matelot. Interspersing in\r\n    his own well digested statement of events, he chose the best\r\n    authenticated accounts from contemporaneous participants, British,\r\n    French Canadian and American, proving that the record as presented by\r\n    Col. Strange and himself last night, was a \"plain unvarnished truthful\r\n    tale,\" a reliable mirror in which was faithfully reflected all that\r\n    was historically interesting as affecting Quebec in the Campaign of\r\n    1775-6. When Mr. LeMoine had terminated his address, which was of\r\n    considerable length, Mr. Stevenson concluded this portion of the\r\n    proceedings with a most eulogistic and deserved recognition of the\r\n    devotion which the two gentlemen who had read during the evening had\r\n    shewn in preparing their respective papers, and a vote of thanks to\r\n    them was heartily and unanimously accorded. He also made reference to\r\n    the topic of the day, the restoration and embellishment of our oft-\r\n    besieged, city, gracefully attributing honour where it was due, first\r\n    and foremost to His Excellency the Governor-General, Earl of Dufferin,\r\n    at whose instigation the plans had been prepared; secondly, to His\r\n    Worship the Mayor, Owen Murphy, Esq., (who was present), for his\r\n    untiring exertions and valuable assistance in developing, maturing and\r\n    preparing the way for an early completion of said designs, which are\r\n    to make Quebec a splendid architectural example of the deformed,\r\n    transformed; thirdly, to the hearty co-operation of the public, aided\r\n    in their views by the enterprise of the proprietor of the _Morning\r\n    Chronicle_, who had prepared the splendid illustrations of these\r\n    improvements, thereby reflecting infinite credit upon himself. After a\r\n    few other remarks the ladies and gentlemen were invited to inspect the\r\n    library, which for the rest of the evening was the centre of\r\n    attraction. The _coup d'oeil_, when once one had fairly entered\r\n    into this beautifully designed, permanent focus of intellectual\r\n    wealth, around whose walls were ranged the imperishable memorials of\r\n    nearly all of man's genius that has been thought worthy of\r\n    preservation, was striking and memorable. As in the lecture room,\r\n    those emblems, which are our symbolical as well as actual rallying\r\n    points in all times of trouble or war, draped and covered the book\r\n    shelves which contain the essence of almost all that human\r\n    intelligence, human thought, human wit, man's invention and ingenuity\r\n    has as yet brought to light. Here, historian and poet, geographer and\r\n    engineer, humorist and preacher, dramatist and theologian, are\r\n    congregated, serving in the one great cause of public instruction and\r\n    the expansion of the limitless ramifications which exist in the ever\r\n    growing tree of knowledge. The student and litérateur, the bibliophile\r\n    and dilletante novel reader, the most frequent visitors here last\r\n    night were replaced by groups of fair women and patriotic men\r\n    assembled to commemorate an event which had a marked effect upon the\r\n    history of this continent in this nineteenth century, which will\r\n    expire a few hours after these lines meet the reader's eyes. In lieu\r\n    of study and thought, the attention of the throng was attracted to the\r\n    splendid stand of arms reaching from floor to ceiling, and which was\r\n    as it were defended by the Dominion standard that fell in long\r\n    festoons behind. In the centre of a diamond-shaped figure, made up of\r\n    scores of sabres pointing inwards, was a large glittering star of\r\n    silvery steel bayonets. In chronological order were pink and gilt\r\n    tablets, containing each one the names of the Lieutenant-Governors of\r\n    Canada, commencing with Carleton, in 1775, and proceeding through the\r\n    noble list, which includes Haldimand, Dorchester, Dalhousie, Gosford,\r\n    Colborne, Durham, Sydenham, Bagot, Cathcart, Elgin, Head, Monk,\r\n    Lisgar, down to the present glorious epoch, when this prosperous\r\n    country is vice-regally and right royally presided over by Lord\r\n    Dufferin, in the year of grace, 1875--on the opposite side of the\r\n    room, under a similar spiky coronet of bristling steel, was hung the\r\n    sword of the dead and vanquished, but honoured and revered hero, the\r\n    trusty blade which only left Montgomery's hands, when in his death-\r\n    throes he 'like a soldier fell,' and the pitiless snow became his\r\n    winding-sheet. On a table below this interesting and valuable historic\r\n    relic, now in possession, as an heirloom, of J. Thompson Harrower,\r\n    Esq., of this city, was exhibited the full uniform of an artillery\r\n    officer of the year 1775. Several quaint old sketches and paintings\r\n    were placed around the Library, which, with the Museum, was converted\r\n    for the time into an extempore conversazione hall, and while the\r\n    melodies of the 'B' Battery band were wafted hither and thither\r\n    through the building, the dames and cavaliers gossiped pleasantly over\r\n    their tea or coffee and delicacies provided by the members for the\r\n    guests, and declared, with much show of reason, that the Literary and\r\n    Historical Society's centennial entertainment was a red-letter day in\r\n    the annals of that learned and well-deserving body.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE JESUITS' CHURCH._\r\n\r\nThis little church, of which the corner stone was laid by the Marquis de\r\nTracy, \"Lieutenant du Roi, dans toutes ses possessions Françaises en\r\nAmérique,\" on 31st May, 1666, existed until 1807. \"It is built,\" says\r\nKalm, \"in the form of a cross. It has a round steeple, and is the only\r\nchurch that has a clock.\" The oldest inhabitant can yet recall, from\r\nmemory, the spot where it stood, even if we had not the excellent drawing\r\nmade of it with a half dozen of other Quebec views, by an officer in\r\nWolfe's fleet, Captain Richard Short. It stood on the site recently\r\noccupied by the shambles, in the Upper Town, facing the Russell House.\r\nCaptain Short's pencil bears again testimony to the exactitude, even in\r\nminute things, of Kalm's descriptions: his Quebec horses, harnessed one\r\nbefore the other to carts. You see in front of the church, in Captain\r\nShort's sketch, three good sized horses, harnessed one before the other,\r\ndrawing a heavily laden two-wheeled cart. The church was also used until\r\n1807 as a place of worship for Protestants. Be careful not to confound the\r\nJesuits' Church with the small chapel in the interior of their college\r\n(the old Jesuit Barracks) contiguous thereto. This latter chapel had been\r\ncommenced on the 11th July, 1650. The Seminary Chapel and Ursulines\r\nChurch, after the destruction by shot and shell, in 1759, of the large\r\nRoman Catholic Cathedral, were used for a time as parish churches. From\r\nbeneath the chief altar of the Jesuits' Church was removed, on the 14th\r\nMay, 1807, the small leaden box containing the heart of the founder of the\r\nUrsulines' Convent, Madame de la Peltrie, previously deposited there in\r\naccordance with the terms of her last will.\r\n\r\nYou can see that the pick-axe and mattock of the \"_bande noire_\" who\r\nrobbed our city walls of their stones, and demolished the Jesuits' College\r\nand city gates, were busily employed long before 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE JESUITS' BARRACKS._\r\n\r\nThere are few, we will venture to say, who, in their daily walk up or down\r\nFabrique Street, do not miss this hoary and familiar land mark, the\r\nJesuits' College. When its removal was recently decreed, for a long time\r\nit resisted the united assaults of hammer and pick-axe, and yielded,\r\nfinally, to the terrific power of dynamite alone.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits' College, older than Harvard College, at Boston, takes one\r\nback to the dawn of Canadian history. Concerning the venerable\r\ninstitution, we translate the following from the French of Mr. T. B.\r\nBédard. It appeared originally in the _Journal de Quebec_:--\r\n\r\n    \"The recent discovery of human bones at the Jesuit Barracks has\r\n    excited the curiosity of the public in general, and especially of\r\n    antiquarians and all interested in historical research. Naturally, the\r\n    question presents itself--who were the individuals interred where\r\n    these bones were found, and what was this place of sepulture? An\r\n    attentive study of the subject leads me to believe that the remains of\r\n    the three skeletons discovered, with two skulls only, are those of\r\n    Brother Jean Liégeois, Père du Quen, and Père Francois du Peron,\r\n    deceased at Chambly, and whose mortal remains were sent to Quebec for\r\n    interment. The spot where the bones were found must have been the site\r\n    of the chapel built at the same time as the other portions of the\r\n    Jesuits' College. But inasmuch as the demolition of this more than\r\n    venerable edifice approaches completion, a sketch of the history of\r\n    its construction may not be amiss.\r\n\r\n    \"Let us preface by saying, with the learned Abbés Laverdière and\r\n    Casgrain, that the residence or the Convent of Notre Dame de la\r\n    Recouvrance, burnt together with the chapel of the same name in 1640,\r\n    should not be confounded with the College (turned later on into\r\n    barracks), the foundations of which were not laid until several years\r\n    afterwards. The Chapel of Notre Dame de la Recouvrance and the\r\n    Jesuits' house attached thereto, were situated upon the ground upon\r\n    which the Anglican Cathedral now stands. In the conflagration of 1640,\r\n    chapel and residence were destroyed; the registers of Civil Status\r\n    burnt, and the Jesuits lost all their effects. 'We had gathered\r\n    together in that house,' writes Father Lejeune, 'as in a little store,\r\n    all the maintenance and support of our other residences and of our\r\n    missions. Linen, clothing, and all the other necessaries for twenty-\r\n    seven persons whom we had among the Hurons, were all ready to be\r\n    conveyed by water into that distant country.' After this disaster, the\r\n    Jesuits were sheltered for some time at the Hôtel Dieu. In 1637 the\r\n    Fathers of the Company of Jesus in Canada set forth to the Company of\r\n    New France that they wished to build a college and a seminary for the\r\n    instruction of Indian youths, the Hurons dwelling 200 leagues from\r\n    Quebec having sent them six, with the promise of a larger number, and\r\n    also for the education of the country, and that, for this purpose,\r\n    they sought a grant of land. The Company of New France awarded them\r\n    twelve acres of ground in Quebec to build a seminary, church,\r\n    residence, &c. This grant was made at a meeting of the Directors of\r\n    the Company, at the hôtel of the celebrated Fouquet, on the 18th\r\n    March, 1637. It was not, however, until the spring of 1647 that the\r\n    work of digging the foundations of the College was begun--the first\r\n    stone being laid on the 12th June. 'The same day,' says the _Journal\r\n    des Jésuites_, 'was laid the first stone of the foundations of the\r\n    offices of the main-building of the Quebec house. In 1648, we\r\n    completed the half of the large main-building, in 1649, our building\r\n    was completed as regards the exterior masonry and the roof; but the\r\n    interior had not yet been touched.' In July, 1650, the foundations of\r\n    the chapel were commenced, and on the 18th October, 1651, it was\r\n    sufficiently advanced to allow the pupils of the college to receive\r\n    therein Governor de Lauzon. 'The scholars,' says again the _Journal\r\n    des Jésuites_, 'received Monsieur the Governor in our new chapel,\r\n    _latinâ oratione et versibus gallicis_, &c., &c. The Indians\r\n    (scholars) danced, when mass was first celebrated in the chapel.' On\r\n    the 29th May, 1655, a great misfortune befell the good Fathers. The\r\n    brother known as Jean Liégeois was treacherously assassinated. He was\r\n    their business man; several times he had crossed over from Canada to\r\n    France in their interests; he was also their architect, and had\r\n    superintended the building of the residences at their various\r\n    missions, as well as the erection of the college. On the day in\r\n    question, while engaged in the fields near Sillery, seven or eight\r\n    Agniers (Iroquois) suddenly surrounded him, captured him without\r\n    resistance, and, put a bullet through his heart, and, adds the\r\n    _Journal des Jésuites_, one of them scalped him, while another\r\n    chopped off his head, which they loft upon the spot. On the following\r\n    day the Algonquins found his body and brought it to Sillery, whence it\r\n    was conveyed in a boat to Quebec, where it was exposed in the chapel,\r\n    and, on the 31st May, after the usual offices, 'it was interred at the\r\n    lower end of the chapel; that is to say, in one of the two sides where\r\n    the altar of the Congregation des Messieurs is now located.' To\r\n    understand these last words, it is necessary to explain that nearly\r\n    two years later, on the 14th February, 1657, Father Poncet founded\r\n    this congregation; and it was M. de Lauzon-Charny, Master of the Woods\r\n    and Forests of New France, son of Governor de Lauzon, who was elected\r\n    Prefect of the first members of the body to the number of twelve. This\r\n    same M. de Charny had married the daughter of M. Giffard, the first\r\n    Seigneur of Beauport; but his wife dying two years after that\r\n    marriage, M. de Charny passed over to France, where he entered holy\r\n    orders, subsequently returning to Canada with Mgr. de Laval, whose\r\n    grand vicar he became, as well as the first ecclesiastical dignitary,\r\n    inasmuch as he replaced him at the Conseil Souverain at the period of\r\n    the difficulties between the Bishop of Petrea and Governor de Mesy.\r\n\r\n    \"But to return to the interments in the Jesuits' Chapel. The next\r\n    which took place was that of Father de Quen, who died on the 8th\r\n    October, 1659, of contagious fever brought into the colony by vessels\r\n    from beyond the seas. It was he, who, in 1647, discovered Lake St.\r\n    John, and, in 1653, celebrated the Mass at the Hôtel Dieu, when the\r\n    Sister Marie de L'Incarnation embraced the religious profession.\r\n    Father de Quen was buried on the morning of the 9th _praesente\r\n    corpore, dictae duae missae privatae, in summo altari, dum diceretur\r\n    officium_. He was 59 years of age. The _Journal des Jésuites_\r\n    does not say that he was interred in the chapel, but it is easy to\r\n    infer the fact from the _two private_ masses said in presence of\r\n    the body, and also because the entry of his burial does not appear in\r\n    the parish register. Moreover, it is also the opinion of Rev. Messrs.\r\n    Laverdière and Casgrain, as published in the _Journal des Jésuites_.\r\n    On the 15th November, 1665, arrived at Quebec, coming from the\r\n    Richelieu River, a vessel bringing the body of Father François du\r\n    Peron, who died on the 10th at Fort St. Louis (Chambly). The body was\r\n    exposed in the Chapel of the Congregation, and 'on the 16th, after the\r\n    service at which the Marquis de Tracy assisted, it was interred in the\r\n    vault of the chapel towards the confessional on the side of the\r\n    street,' and Father le Mercier, who wrote the foregoing, adds that\r\n    'there remains room only for another body.'\r\n\r\n    \"From the preceding, it appears that three interments took place in\r\n    the Jesuits' Chapel (the only ones mentioned in the _Journal des\r\n    Jésuites_), and it is probable that the place remaining for only\r\n    one more body was never filled. The remains of three bodies having\r\n    been found, it seems to me therefore reasonable to conclude that they\r\n    are those of Brother Liégeois and Fathers de Quen and du Peron. It is\r\n    true only two skulls have been recovered, but it must be remembered\r\n    that Brother Liégeois had his head chopped off and left upon the spot,\r\n    as remarks the text, so that it is easy to conjecture that the\r\n    Iroquois dragged his body further off, when it was found in a headless\r\n    condition and thus buried. With respect to the site of the chapel, the\r\n    text already cited relative to Father du Peron indicates sufficiently\r\n    that it was alongside the street; and a reference to the map of Quebec\r\n    in 1660 shows in fact the street skirting the Jesuits' property as it\r\n    does to-day. Further, the excavations which, at the request of Père\r\n    Sachez, Dr. Larue and others, Hon. Mr. Joly, with a good will which\r\n    cannot be too highly praised, has ordered to be made, have already\r\n    laid bare the foundations of a well outlined building upon the very\r\n    site where tradition locates the chapel and where the bones have been\r\n    found.\r\n\r\n    \"As it was stated at the time of the finding of the skeletons that one\r\n    of them was supposed to be that of a nun of the Hôtel Dieu, Mr. Bédard\r\n    applied to the authorities of that institution for information on the\r\n    subject and received an answer from the records which conclusively\r\n    proves that the nun in question was buried in the vault of the\r\n    Jesuits' Church and not in their Chapel.\"\r\n\r\nThough a considerable sum had been granted to foster Jesuit establishments\r\nat Quebec by a young French nobleman, René de Rohault, son of the Marquis\r\nde Gamache, as early as 1626, it was on the 18th March, 1637, only, that\r\nthe ground to build on, \"twelve arpents of land, in the vicinity of Fort\r\nSt. Louis\" were granted to the Jesuit Fathers. In the early times, we find\r\nthis famous seat of learning playing a prominent part in all public\r\npageants; its annual examinations and distribution of prizes called\r\ntogether the _élite_ of Quebec society. The leading pupils had, in\r\npoetry and in verse, congratulated Governor d'Argenson on his arrival in\r\n1658. On the 2nd July, 1666, a public examination on logic brought out,\r\nwith great advantage, two most promising youths, the famous Louis Jolliet,\r\nwho later on joined Father Marquette in his discovery of the Mississippi,\r\nand a Three Rivers youth, Pierre de Francheville, who intended to enter\r\nHoly Orders. The learned Intendant Talon was an examiner; he was remarked\r\nfor the erudition his Latin questions displayed. Memory likes to revert to\r\nthe times when the illustrious Bossuet was undergoing his Latin\r\nexaminations at Navarre, with the Great Condé as his examiner; France's\r\nfirst sacred orator confronted by her most illustrious general.\r\n\r\nHow many thrilling memories were recalled by this grim old structure?\r\n\"Under its venerable roof, oft had met the pioneer missionaries of New\r\nFrance, the band of martyrs, the geographers, discoverers, _savants_\r\nand historians of this learned order: Dolbeau, de Quen, Druilletes,\r\nDaniel, de la Brosse, de Crepieul, de Carheil, Bréboeuf, Lallemant,\r\nJogues, de Noue, Raimbeault, Albanel, Chaumonot, Dablon, Ménard, LeJeune,\r\nMassé, Vimont, Ragueneau, Charlevoix, [58] and crowds of others.\" Here\r\nthey assembled to receive from the General of the Jesuits their orders, to\r\ncompare notes, mayhap to discuss the news of the death or of the success\r\nof some of their indefatigable explorers of the great West; how the \"good\r\nword\" had been fearlessly carried to the distant shores of Lake Huron, to\r\nthe _bayous_ and perfumed groves of Florida, or to the trackless and\r\nfrozen regions of Hudson's Bay.\r\n\r\nLater on, when France had suppressed the order of the Jesuits, and when\r\nher lily banner had disappeared from our midst, the College and its\r\ngrounds were appropriated to other uses--alas! less congenial.\r\n\r\nThe roll of the English drum and the sharp \"word of command\" of a British\r\nadjutant or of his drill sergeant, for a century or more, resounded in the\r\nhalls, in which Latin orisons were formerly sung; and in the classic\r\ngrounds and grassy court, [59] canopied by those stately oaks and elms,\r\nwhich our sires yet remember, to which the good Fathers retreated in sweet\r\nseclusion, to \"say\" their _Breviaries_ and tell their beads, might have\r\nbeen heard the coarse joke of the guard room and coarser oath of the\r\ntrooper.\r\n\r\nIt had been claimed as a \"magazine for the army contractor's provisions on\r\n14th November, 1760.\" On the 4th June, 1765, His Excellency General James\r\nMurray had it surveyed and appropriated for quarters and barracks for the\r\ntroops, excepting some apartments. The court and garden was used as a\r\ndrill and parade ground until the departure of Albion's soldiers. Here was\r\nread on the 14th November, 1843, by Major-General Sir Jas. Hope's\r\ndirection, the order of the day, at the morning parade, congratulating\r\nMajor Bennet and the brave men of the 1st Royals, whom he was escorting to\r\nEngland in the ill-fated transport \"Premier,\" on the discipline and good\r\nconduct manifested by them during the incredible perils they had escaped\r\nat Cape Chatte when the Premier was stranded.\r\n\r\nHow singular, how sad to think that this loved, this glorious relic of the\r\nFrench _régime_, entire even to the Jesuit College arms, carved in\r\nstone over its chief entrance, should have remained sacred and intact\r\nduring the century of occupation by English soldiery--and that its\r\ndestruction should have been decreed so soon as the British legions, by\r\ntheir departure, in 1871, had virtually handed it over to the French\r\nProvince of Quebec?\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the 28th August, 1878, of human remains beneath the floor\r\nof this building--presumed to be those of some of the early missionaries--\r\ninduced the authorities to institute a careful search during its\r\ndemolition. These bones and others exhumed on the 31st August, and on the\r\n1st and 9th September, 1878, were pronounced by two members of the\r\nFaculty, Drs. Hubert Larue and Chas. E. Lemieux, both Professors of the\r\nLaval University, (who signed a certificate to that effect) to be the\r\nremains of three [60] persons of the male sex and of three [61] persons of\r\nthe female sex. Some silver and copper coins were also found, which with\r\nthese mouldering remains of humanity, were deposited under lock and key in\r\na wooden box; and in September, 1878, the whole was placed in a small but\r\nsubstantial stone structure, in the court of the Jesuit Barracks, known as\r\nthe \"Regimental Magazine,\" pending their delivery for permanent disposal\r\nto Rev. Père Sachez, Superior of the Jesuits Order in Quebec.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1879, on opening this magazine, it was found that the venerable\r\nbones, box and all had disappeared, the staple of the padlock on the door\r\nhaving been forced. By whom and for what purpose, the robbery?\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE RÉCOLLET CONVENT._\r\n\r\nLet us walk on, and view with the Professor's eyes the adjoining public\r\nedifice in 1749, the Récollet Convent, \"a spacious building,\" says Kalm,\r\n\"two story high, with a large orchard and kitchen garden.\" It stood\r\napparently on the south-eastern extremity of the area, on which the\r\nAnglican Cathedral was built in 1804, across what is now the southern\r\nprolongation of Treasury Street; it is said its eastern end occupied a\r\nportion of the site now occupied by the old _Place d'Armes_--now the\r\nRing.\r\n\r\nIts church or chapel was, on 6th September, 1796, destroyed by fire; two\r\neye-witnesses of the conflagration, Philippe Aubert DeGaspé and Deputy-\r\nCommissary-General James Thompson, the first in his _Mémoires_, the second\r\nin his unpublished _Diary_, have vividly portrayed the accident.\r\n\r\n    \"At the date of the conflagration of the Récollets Church, 6th\r\n    September, 1796, the bodies of those who had been interred there were\r\n    taken up. The remains of persons of note, those among others of Count\r\n    de Frontenac, were re-interred in the Cathedral (now the Basilica), it\r\n    is said, under the floor of the Chapel N. D. of Pity. The leaden\r\n    coffins, which, it appears, had been placed on iron bars in the\r\n    Récollets Church, had been partially melted by the fire. In Count de\r\n    Frontenac's coffin was found a small leaden box, which contained the\r\n    heart of that Governor. According to a tradition, handed down by Frère\r\n    Louis, the heart of Count de Frontenac was, after his death, sent to\r\n    his widow in France. But the haughty Countess refused to receive it,\r\n    saying that 'she did not want a dead heart, which when beating did not\r\n    belong to her.' The casket containing the heart was sent back to\r\n    Canada and replaced in the Count's coffin, where it was found after\r\n    the fire.\" (_Abbé H. R. Casgrain_.)\r\n\r\nThe Church faced the Ring and the old Château; it formed part of the\r\nRécollet Convent, \"a vast quadrangular building, with a court and well\r\nstocked orchard\" on Garden Street; it was occasionally used as a state\r\nprison. The Huguenot and agitator, Pierre DuCalvet, [62] spent some dreary\r\ndays in its cells in 1781-84; and during the summer of 1776, a young\r\nvolunteer under Benedict Arnold, John Joseph Henry, (who lived to become a\r\ndistinguished Pennsylvania Judge), was immured in this monastery, after\r\nhis capture by the British, at the unsuccessful attack in Sault-au-Matelot\r\nStreet, on the 31st December, 1775, as he graphically relates in his\r\n_Memoirs_. It was a monastery of the Order of Saint Francis. The\r\nProvincial, in 1793, a well-known, witty, jovial and eccentric personage,\r\nFather Félix DeBerey, had more than once dined and wined His Royal\r\nHighness Prince Edward, the father of our gracious Sovereign, when\r\nstationed in our garrison in 1791-4, with his regiment, the 7th Fusiliers.\r\n\r\nThe Récollet Church was also a sacred and last resting place for the\r\nillustrious dead. Of the six French Governors who expired at Quebec, four\r\nslept within its silent vaults, until the translation, in 1796, of their\r\nashes to the vaults of the Basilica, viz: (1) Frontenac, (2) de Callières,\r\n(3) Vaudreuil, (4) de la Jonquière. [63] Governor de Mesy had been buried\r\nin the Hôtel-Dieu Cemetery, and the first Governor, de Champlain, it is\r\ngenerally believed, was interred near the Château Saint Louis, in a\r\n\"sépulchre particulier,\" near the spot now surmounted by his bust, on\r\nwhich, in 1871, was erected the new Post Office.\r\n\r\nOn the south-west side of the Château, on the site where stands M. A.\r\nBerthelot's old dwelling on St. Louis Street, now owned by James Dunbar,\r\nEsq., Q.C., could be seen a building devoted to the administration of\r\nJustice, _La Sénéchaussée_ (Séneschal's Jurisdiction), and which bore\r\nthe name of \"The Palace.\" It was doubtless there that, in 1664, the\r\nSupreme Council held its sessions. In 1665 it was assigned to the Marquis\r\nde Tracy, for a residence whilst in the colony. From the _Place d'Armes_,\r\nthe higher road (_Grande Allée_) took its departure and led to Cap Rouge.\r\nOn the right and left of this road, were several small lots of land given\r\nto certain persons for the purpose of being built upon. The Indian Fort\r\nwas that entrenchment of which we have spoken, which served as a last\r\nhiding place to the sad remains of the once powerful Huron nation, forming\r\nin all eighty four souls, in the year 1665. It had continued to be\r\noccupied by them up to the peace with the Iroquois. After the arrival of\r\nthe troops, they took their departure in order to devote themselves to the\r\ncultivation of the lands.\r\n\r\nBesides the buildings of the Reverend Jesuit Fathers, those of the\r\nUrsulines (nuns), and those of the Hospital (Hôtel Dieu), in the Upper\r\nTown, could be seen in a house situated behind the altar part of the\r\nParish Church, where dwelt Monseigneur de Laval. It was, probably, what he\r\ncalled his Seminary, and where he caused some young men to be educated,\r\ndestined afterwards for the priesthood.\r\n\r\nIt was at the Seminary the worthy prelate resided with his priests, to the\r\nnumber of eight, which, at that period, comprised all the secular clergy\r\nof Quebec. There, also, was the Church of Notre Dame, in the form of a\r\nLatin cross. [64]\r\n\r\nCouillard Street calls up one of the most important personages of the era\r\nof Champlain, Guillaume Couillard, the ancestor of Madame Alexandre de\r\nLéry _née_ Couillard. It would fill a volume to retrace the historical\r\nincidents which attach themselves to \"La Grande Place du Fort,\" which in\r\nthe early part of the century was known as the \"Grand Parade\" before the\r\nCastle, and is now called the _Ring_. We have pointed out a goodly number\r\nin the first pages (10-16) of the \"Album du Touriste.\" To what we have\r\nalready said we shall add the following details:\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE UNION HOTEL._\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the site upon which the Union Hotel was built [65]\r\n(1805), and where previously stood the dwelling of Dr. Longmore, Staff\r\nMedical Officer, now occupied by the offices of the _Journal de Quebec,\r\n&c._, was owned by Governor D'Ailleboust, about the year 1650. He had\r\nreserved to himself, on the 10th January, 1649, the strip of ground\r\ncomprised between Fort and Treasury Streets on the one side, and the\r\nstreets Buade and Ste. Anne on the other side. At the corner of Treasury\r\nand Buade Streets, on the west, Jean Côté possessed a piece of ground\r\n(_emplacement_) which he presented as a dowry in 1649, to his daughter\r\nSimonne, who married Pierre Soumandre.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of the Archbishop's Palace formed part of the field possessed\r\nby Couillard, whose house stood in the now existing garden of the\r\nSeminary, opposite the gate which faces the principal alley, the\r\nfoundations of which were discovered and brought to light by the Abbé\r\nLaverdière in 1866. The Union Hotel was for years the meeting place of our\r\nfestive ancestors, when the assembly balls brought together the Saxon and\r\nthe Gaul; it also recalls warlike memories of 1812.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE AMERICAN PRISONERS._\r\n\r\nIn looking over old fyles of our city journals, we find in the _Quebec\r\nMercury_ of 15th September, 1812, the following item:\r\n\r\n    \"On Friday, arrived here the detained prisoners taken with Gen. Hull,\r\n    at Detroit. The non-commissioned officers and privates immediately\r\n    embarked on board of transports in the harbour, which are to serve as\r\n    their prison. The commissioned officers were liberated on their\r\n    parole. They passed Saturday morning at the Union Hotel, where they\r\n    were the gazing-stock of the multitude, whilst they, no way abashed,\r\n    presented a bold front to the public stare, puffed the smoke of their\r\n    cigars into the faces of such as approached too near. About two\r\n    o'clock they set off in a stage, with four horses, for Charlesbourg,\r\n    the destined place of their residence.\"\r\n\r\nThe Union Hotel here mentioned is the identical building erected for a\r\nhotel by a company in 1805, and now owned by the _Journal de Quebec_,\r\nfacing the ring.\r\n\r\nWere these prisoners located at Charlesbourg proper, or at that locality\r\nfacing Quebec, in Beauport, called _Le Canardière_, in Judge de Bonne's\r\nformer stately old mansion, on which the eastern and detached wing of the\r\nBeauport Lunatic Asylum now stands?\r\n\r\nTradition has ever pointed to this building as that which sheltered the\r\ndisconsolate American warriors in 1812, with the adjoining rivulet,\r\n_Ruisseau de l'Ours_, as the boundary to the east which their parole\r\nprecluded their crossing.\r\n\r\nThe result of the American defeat at Detroit had been important--\"one\r\ngeneral officer (Wadsworth), two lieutenant-colonels, five majors, a\r\nmultitude of captains and subalterns, with nine hundred men, one field-\r\npiece and a stand of colors, were the fruits of the victory, the enemy\r\nhaving lost in killed, wounded, missing and prisoners, upwards of fifteen\r\nhundred.\" (Christie's History.)\r\n\r\nAmongst the American prisoners sent down to Quebec was the celebrated\r\nGeneral Winfield Scott, who lived to cull laurels in the Mexican war. He\r\nwas then Col. Scott, and there is yet (1878) living in Quebec an old\r\nresident, R. Urquhart, who well remembers, when a boy, seeing the \"tall\r\nand stern American Colonel.\" He was six feet five inches in height.\r\n(Lossing, p. 408.)\r\n\r\nOf these prisoners taken at Detroit, twenty-three had been recognized as\r\nBritish born and deserters from the English army. they were sent to\r\nEngland for trial. It is yet possible that some of the veterans of 1812,\r\nby their diaries or other sources of information, may tell us who were the\r\nCharlesbourg or Beauport captives in 1812. They had not been under\r\nrestraint much more than a week, when, by the following advertisement in\r\nthe _Quebec Mercury_, dated 29th September, we find the British Government\r\nattending to their comforts with a truly maternal foresight:--\r\n\r\n    Commissary General's Office,\r\n\r\n    QUEBEC, 28th Sept., 1812\r\n\r\n    \"Wanted for the American prisoners of war, comfortable warm clothing,\r\n    consisting of the following articles:\r\n\r\n      Jackets,\r\n      Shirts,\r\n      Trowsers,\r\n      Stockings,\r\n      Moccassins or Shoes.\r\n      Also 2000 pounds of soap.\"\r\n\r\nFrom which it is clear John Bull intended his American cousins should not\r\nonly be kept warm, but suitably scrubbed as well. Two thousand lbs. of\r\nsoap foreshadowed a fabulous amount of scrubbing. Colonel Scott and\r\nfriends were evidently \"well off for soap.\"\r\n\r\nColonel Coffin, of Ottawa, the annalist of the War of 1812, in reply to a\r\nquery of mine, writes me:\r\n\r\n    \"Scott remained in Canada from the date of his surrender, 23d October,\r\n    1812, to the period of his departure from Quebec, say May, 1813. But\r\n    he was on parole the whole time, and from Quebec, as given in his life\r\n    by Mansfield, p. 55, he went in a cartel to Boston, and soon after was\r\n    exchanged. Under these circumstances, I do not think it likely that he\r\n    would have been escorted militarily in custody anywhere. Winder may\r\n    have been also taken to Quebec, or he may have been exchanged on the\r\n    Western frontier. Armstrong's 'War of 1812' will probably give the\r\n    details.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Quebec Mercury_, of 27th October, 1812, contains the following:\r\n\r\n    \"The prisoners taken at Detroit and brought down to Quebec are on the\r\n    point of embarking for Boston for the purpose of being exchanged. Five\r\n    cannon are now lying in the _Château_ Court taken at Detroit.\"\r\n\r\nIn retaliation for the twenty-three American prisoners sent for trial to\r\nEngland, as deserters from the British army, the American Government had\r\nordered that forty-six British prisoners of war should be detained in\r\nclose confinement.\r\n\r\n    \"In consequence of this,\" says Christie, \"the Governor ordered all the\r\n    American officers, prisoners of war, without exception of rank, to be\r\n    immediately placed into close confinement as hostages, until the\r\n    number of forty-six were completed over and above those already in\r\n    confinement. In pursuance of this order, Generals Winder, Chandler and\r\n    Winchester were conveyed from their quarters in the country at\r\n    Beauport to a private house in Quebec, where their confinement was\r\n    rendered as little inconvenient as their situation could admit of.\"\r\n\r\n    They were exchanged in April, 1814, against British officers,\r\n    prisoners of war in the States.\r\n\r\nIn connection with General Scott's captivity at Quebec, Lossing relates a\r\nlittle incident, which redounds to his credit:--\r\n\r\n    \"When the prisoners were about to sail from Quebec, a party came on\r\n    board the vessel, mustered the captives and commenced separating from\r\n    the rest those who, by their accent, were found to be Irishmen. These\r\n    they intended to send to England for trial as traitors in a frigate\r\n    lying near, in accordance with the doctrine that a British subject\r\n    cannot expatriate himself. Scott, who was below, hearing a tumult on\r\n    deck, went up. He was soon informed of the cause, and at once entered\r\n    a vehement protest against the proceedings. He commanded his soldiers\r\n    to be absolutely silent, that their accent might not betray them. He\r\n    was repeatedly ordered to go below, and as repeatedly refused. The\r\n    soldiers obeyed him. Twenty-three had been already detected as\r\n    Irishmen, but not another one became a victim. The twenty-three were\r\n    taken on board the frigate in irons. Scott boldly assured them that if\r\n    the British Government dared to injure a hair of their head, his own\r\n    Government would fully avenge the outrage. He at the same time as\r\n    boldly defied the menacing officers, and comforted the manacled\r\n    prisoners in every way. Scott was exchanged in January, 1813, and at\r\n    once sent a full report of this affair to the Secretary of War. He\r\n    hastened to Washington in person, and pressed the subject upon the\r\n    attention of Congress. Fortunately, the President never had occasion\r\n    to exercise this retaliation, the British Government having abstained\r\n    from carrying out in practice, in the case of the American prisoners,\r\n    its cherished doctrine of perpetual allegiance.\r\n\r\n    \"The final result of Scott's humane and courageous conduct in this\r\n    matter was very gratifying to himself. Almost three years after the\r\n    event at Quebec, he was greeted by loud huzzahs as he was passing a\r\n    wharf on the East River side of New York city. It came from a group of\r\n    Irishmen, who had just landed from an emigrant ship. There were\r\n    twenty-one out of the twenty-three prisoners for whom he had cared so\r\n    tenderly. They had just returned from a long confinement in English\r\n    prisons. They recognized their benefactor, and, says Scott's\r\n    biographer, \"nearly crushed him by their warm-hearted embraces.\"\r\n    (Lossing's Field Book, p. 409.)\r\n\r\n        Some years back a discussion took place in the columns of the\r\n        _Morning Chronicle_, of Quebec, as to the names of the volunteers\r\n        of Bell's Cavalry who had escorted the U. S. prisoners of war in\r\n        1812 from Beauport to Quebec. The following extract from our diary\r\n        throws some light on this subject:\r\n\r\n\r\n        _THE LAST SURVIVORS OF BELL'S CAVALRY IN 1812._\r\n\r\n        \"Among more than one strange meeting, which that welcome haven of\r\n        the wearied wayfarer, the way-side inn, has brought me, in course\r\n        of many peregrinations through the length and breadth of the\r\n        Province of Quebec, none can I recall less anticipated, than the\r\n        one which happened to me this 22nd March, 1881. I reached that\r\n        night at 10.30, direct from the Kennebec Railway, the parlor of\r\n        Monsieur Lessard's Temperance Hotel at St. Joseph, Beauce. (Such\r\n        the euphonious name the Licence Act awards to these fallacious\r\n        emblems of comfort or good cheer). After a lengthy interview, I\r\n        next day parted, possibly for ever, from an old and withered\r\n        _sabreur_ of 1812, the last survivor, I think, of that dashing\r\n        volunteer cavalry corps, raised by Capt. the Hon. Matthew Bell at\r\n        Quebec in 1812.\r\n\r\n        I had the rare luck of having from the very lips of this\r\n        octogenarian, an account of the share he had in conducting as one\r\n        of the cavalry detachment detailed to escort Colonel Winfield\r\n        Scott and brother officers from Beauport, where they were confined\r\n        as prisoners on _parole_, to the district prison in St. Stanislas\r\n        street (the Morrin College) from whence the \"big\" Colonel and his\r\n        comrades were taken and lodged in Colonel Coffin's house in St.\r\n        Louis street.\r\n\r\n        How different the careers! Scott in time became the hero of the\r\n        war with Mexico, and the dashing cavalry corporal who escorted\r\n        him, aged now 89, after 30 years tenure of office, still holds the\r\n        position of village Postmaster, in the township of Broughton,\r\n        Beauce. Among the incidents of which my ancient acquaintance seems\r\n        proud, is that of his having played at cards with General Scott\r\n        and his captive comrades.\r\n\r\n        \"Charles Hy. J. Hall,\" (such his clear and well written autograph\r\n        authenticating the memorandum I drew up for him) a roystering\r\n        _militaire_ and _bon vivant_, in our good city, seventy years ago,\r\n        presents in his person a rare instance of mental and physical\r\n        faculties well preserved until the end--memory, sight, mind,\r\n        appetite, all unimpaired.\r\n\r\n        I was so interested when he informed me that he had been one of\r\n        Col. Bell's cavalry, (I felt convinced that, of all the members of\r\n        this dashing corps, he was the last survivor,) that I questioned\r\n        him very closely, and cross-examined him on such matters of\r\n        detail, which an eye-witness alone could know. Mr. Hall, the son\r\n        of the late Wm. Hall, of Fabrique street, Quebec, is connected\r\n        with several of our most noted families. His father came to Canada\r\n        about 1783, from the adjoining provinces,--a United Empire\r\n        Loyalist, and became wealthy. Subjoined will be found a short\r\n        statement taken down as it fell from the lips of my new\r\n        acquaintance, and authenticated by his signature. Mr. Chas. Hall\r\n        is Postmaster of Broughton, County of Beauce.\"--(_Diary of J.

Hall, a well-\r\n        to-do Quebecer, whose partner in business I subsequently was,\r\n        lived at what I should call No. 1 Fabrique street (the house\r\n        lately vacated by Behan Bros). I was born in a house in St. John\r\n        street. I loved to roam--have travelled the world over and\r\n        received some hard knocks in my day. As to that part of my career,\r\n        which seems particularly to interest you--the war of 1812--I\r\n        regret I cannot tell you as much as you wish to know. In 1812 I\r\n        joined Capt. the Hon. Matthew Bell's Volunteer Cavalry; we\r\n        numbered between 90 to 100 men. Our uniform was blue coat, red\r\n        collar,--silver braid; arms, a sabre and holster pistols. As\r\n        volunteers every man furnished his own horse, suits, etc. My\r\n        horse, which cost me thirty guineas, I refused sixty for from Col.\r\n        McNeil; our mounts were of Canadian, American, and English\r\n        pedigree.\r\n\r\n        We were commanded by Col. Bell; Hon Wm. Sheppard (late of\r\n        Woodfield), was our Major, Mr. Hale, our Captain, Wm. Henderson,\r\n        our Lieutenant. I cannot say, in reply to your question, whether\r\n        the late Hammond Gowan was our Cornet. Our house stood next to\r\n        that where General Brock had lived, in Fabrique street. I was, in\r\n        1812, one of the escort who took General Winfield Scott, Col.\r\n        Winder,----from Beauport; I remember well the big Col. Scott, as I\r\n        played cards with the American officers who were, on their parole,\r\n        quartered in Judge DeBonne's house, on the site of which the east\r\n        wing of the Lunatic Asylum has since been erected. I formed part\r\n        of the escort who conducted the American officers to the Quebec\r\n        jail, in St. Stanislas street, previous to their being located in\r\n        a St. Louis street house. During the war, under Sir George\r\n        Prevost, I formed, in March, part of the detachment of cavalry,\r\n        sent with a company of the 103rd, to the parish of St. Joseph,\r\n        Beauce, to arrest some militia men who had refused to enlist. The\r\n        ice-bridge before Quebec, started a few minutes after our last\r\n        horse had crossed.\r\n\r\n        CHAS. HY. J.

The Captain wishes the different articles to\r\n        be good and strong, but not of an expensive kind.\r\n\r\n        28th March.--A detachment was ordered on service to Ste. Marie\r\n        Nouvelle Beauce and St. Joseph, returning on the 31st under the\r\n        command of Lieutenant Hale, consisting of two officers, two\r\n        sergeants, one corporal, 18 privates; total, 23.\r\n\r\nAt right angles from Buade Street, opposite the wall [66] which surrounds\r\nSt. Joseph Cemetery, enclosed between the Basilica and the street, there\r\nexists, since the earliest times, a short, narrow street--more properly a\r\nlane--_Treasury Street_. The French know it as _Rue du Trésor_, because\r\nunder French rule, the Government Office, where public monies were\r\npaid out, stood in the vicinity. Until the departure of the English\r\ngarrison and removal of the Commissariat Staff, in 1871, Treasury Street\r\nwas one of the avenues which led contractors and others to the Royal\r\nCommissariat Department, at the east end of St. Louis Street. Here, for\r\nyears, were dealt out lavishly either the old French or Spanish piastres\r\nduring the war of 1812-14, the proceeds of the army bills, and later on,\r\nEnglish sovereigns, guineas and doubloons, &c. The Commissariat office was\r\nsituate facing the Ring, and after the departure of the British troops,\r\nabout 1871, was used as the office and dwelling of the Deputy Adjutant\r\nGeneral of Militia. The lot, which, with the garden in rear, reaches to\r\nMount Carmel Street, had been bought by the Ordnance from Mr. Peter\r\nBréhault in the early part of the century.\r\n\r\nPrince Edward had brought to Quebec from Gibraltar, in 1791, as his\r\nSecretary, Capt. John Hale, 2nd Queen's Regiment. Capt. Hale was the\r\neldest son of Brevet Major John Hale, [67] of the 47th, who served under\r\nGeneral Wolfe at Quebec. Major J. Hale subsequently became General Hale.\r\nCapt. John Hale, after stopping at Quebec with the Prince, subsequently\r\nreturned to Halifax with him. He was afterwards appointed by the Imperial\r\nauthorities Deputy Paymaster General to the Forces in Canada. He, it was,\r\nwho owned the lot on which the Commissary-General's office stood. This\r\noccurred previous to 1812. He sold the property to Peter Bréhault, who had\r\ncome out to Canada as an employé to John Muire, Esq. Mr. Bréhault resold\r\nit to the Imperial Government, the Paymaster's Office being merged into\r\nthe Commissariat Office. The Ursuline nuns have named, after their patron\r\nSaint, Ste. Ursule, the first street to the west, which intersects at\r\nright angles, St. Louis and Ste. Anne streets. Ste. Ursule and Ste. Anne\r\nstreets and environs seem to have been specially appropriated by the\r\ndisciples of Hippocrates. Physicians [68] and surgeons there assuredly do\r\ncongregate, viz.: Dr. James Sewell, his son, Dr. Colin Sewell, Drs.\r\nLandry, Lemieux, Simard, Belleau, Russell, Russell, Jr., Gale, Ross,\r\nBaillargeon, Roy, Fortier, LaRue, Parke, Rowand, Henchey, Vallée, Marsden,\r\nJackson--distinguished physicians. Notwithstanding that it is the abode of\r\nso many eminent members of the Faculty, the locality is healthy; nay,\r\nconducive to longevity.\r\n\r\nThe streets Aylmer, Burton, Bagot, Craig, Carleton, Dorchester, Dalhousie,\r\nHaldimand, Hope, Metcalf, Murray, Prevost, Richmond, perpetuate the memory\r\nof thirteen English Governors, while four French Governors have left their\r\nnames on as many thoroughfares--Buade, Champlain, d'Aillebout, Montmagny.\r\nMany of the luxurious dwellings on the Cape date back to 1840 or so; this\r\nnow aristocratic neighborhood, after the conquest and until 1830, was\r\noccupied by carters, old French market gardeners and descendants of French\r\nartisans, &c.--such were the early tenants of Des Carrières, Mont Carmel,\r\nSte. Geneviève, St. Denis, Des Grissons streets.--\"_Mais nous avons\r\nchangé tout cela._\"\r\n\r\nA few years since, the Town Council, on motion of Councillor Ernest\r\nGagnon, whose name is identified with our popular songs, [69] disturbed\r\nthe nomenclature of that part of D'Aiguillon street, _extra muros_, by\r\nsubstituting the name of \"Charlevoix.\" To that section of St. Joseph\r\nstreet, _intra muros_, was conferred the name of our respected historian,\r\nF. X Garneau. [70] To St. François street, the name of the historian,\r\nFerland, was awarded; the historian, Robert Christie, [71] has also his\r\nstreet. This met with general approval.\r\n\r\n\"On ascending,\" says Abbé Faillon, \"from the Lower to the Upper Town by a\r\ntortuous road, contrived betwixt the rocks, and on the right hand side, we\r\nreach the Cemetery. [72] This road, which terminated at the Parish Church,\r\n[73] divided itself into two,--on one side it led to the Jesuits (Jesuits'\r\nCollege) and to the Hospital (Hôtel Dieu); and on the other, to the Indian\r\nFort [74] and to the Castle of Saint Louis. The Castle and King's Fort,\r\nguarded by soldiers night and day, under the orders of the Governor, was\r\nof an irregular shape, flanked by bastions, fortified by pieces of\r\nartillery, and contained in its interior several _suites_ of apartments\r\nseparated one from the other. At the distance of about forty toises (240\r\nfeet) from the Castle was seen, on the south side, a small garden, fenced\r\nin, for the use of the Governor, and in front, towards the west, was the\r\n_Place d'Armes_ (now the _Ring_), in the form of a trapezium.\"\r\n\r\nSt. John street, for years without a rival as chief commercial\r\nthoroughfare for retail trade in dry goods, sees its former busy aspect\r\ndaily fleeting since the invasion of that bitter foe to wheeled vehicles--\r\nthe street railway. Its glory is departing: the mercer's showy counter and\r\nshelves are gradually replaced by vegetable and fruit stores. Stately\r\nshops on Desfosses, Crown and Craig streets are rapidly diverting the\r\n_Pactolus_ of the city custom northwards. In the dark ages of the\r\nAncient Capital, when this lengthy, narrow lane was studded with one-story\r\nwooden or stone tenements, Old Sol occasionally loved to look down and\r\ngladden with his rays its miry footpaths. To our worthy grandfathers 'twas\r\na favorite _rendezvous_--the _via sacra_--the Regent street--the\r\n_Boulevard des Italiens_--where the _beau monde_ congregated at 4 P.M.,\r\nsharp; where the merry jingle of the tandem _grelots_ invaded the frosty\r\nair in January; where the freshest toilettes, the daintiest bonnets--those\r\n\"ducks of bonnets\" invented fifty years ago by Mrs. T--d--ensnared\r\nadmirers; where marten or \"silver fox\" muffs of portentous size--all the\r\nrage then--kept warm and coursing the stream of life in tiny, taper hands,\r\ncold, alas! now in Death's pitiless grasp; where the old millionaire,\r\nGeorge Pozer, chinked his English guineas or piled up in his desk his army\r\nbills. Alas! Jean Bourdon, the pioneer of our land surveyors, you, who,\r\nmore than two centuries ago, left your name to this vaunted locality--your\r\nstreet as well as your name are getting to be things of the past! Shall we\r\nbid adieu to this oft travelled over thoroughfare without deigning a\r\nparting glance, as we saunter on, at that low old-fashioned house, No. 84,\r\non the north side of the street, where, for a quarter of a century and\r\nmore, Monsieur Charles Hamel's book and church ornament emporium held its\r\nown against all the other book stores? It is now occupied as a dwelling\r\nand a notarial office by an ex-Mayor and late member for the city, P. A.\r\nTourangeau, Esq., N.P. Vividly, indeed, can we recall the busy aspect of\r\nits former counter, studded with gilt madonnas, rosaries, some in brass\r\nmountings, variegated Job beads for the million; others set in ebony and\r\nsilver for rich _dévotes_, flanked with wax tapers, sparkling church\r\nornaments, bronze crucifixes--backed with shelves of books bearing, some,\r\nthe _visa_ of Monseigneur de Tours--the latter for the faithful; others in\r\nan inner room, without the _visa_--these for city _littérateurs_; whilst\r\nin a shady corner-cupboard, imported to order--sometimes without order--\r\nstood a row of short-necked but robust bottles, labelled \"_Grande\r\nChartreuse_\" and \"_Bénédictine_,\" for the especial delectation of a few\r\nQuebec Brillat-Savarins--the _gourmets_!\r\n\r\nMonsieur Hamel, a sly, courteous, devout old bachelor, had a honied word,\r\na holy, upturned glance, a jaunty welcome for all and every one of his\r\nnumerous \"dévotes\" or fashionable _pratiques_. A small fortune was\r\nthe result of the attention to business, thrift and correct calculations\r\nof this pink of French politeness. Monsieur Chas. Hamel, honoured by his\r\nfamiliars with the sobriquet \"Lily Hamel,\" possibly because his urbanity\r\nwas more than masculine, in fact, quite lady-like--the _crème de la\r\ncrème_ of commercial suavity. This stand, frequented by the Quebec\r\ngentry from 1840 to 1865, had gradually become a favourite stopping place,\r\na kind of half-way house, where many aged valetudinarians tarried a few\r\nminutes to gossip with friends equally aged, homeward bound, on bright\r\nwinter afternoons, direct from their daily \"constitutional\" walk, as far\r\nas the turnpike on St. John's road. Professor Hubert Larue [75] will\r\nintroduce us to some of the _habitués_ of this little club, which he\r\nstyles _Le Club des Anciens_, a venerable brotherhood uniting choice\r\nspirits among city _littérateurs_, antiquarians, superannuated Militia\r\nofficers, retired merchants: Messrs. Henry Forsyth, Long John Fraser,\r\nLieut.-Colonel Benjamin LeMoine, F. X. Garneau, G. B. Faribault, P. A. De\r\nGaspé, Commissary-General Jas. Thompson, Major Lafleur, Chs. Pinguet, the\r\nvaliant Captain of the City Watch in 1837. The junior members counted from\r\nfifty to sixty summers; their seniors had braved some sixty or seventy\r\nwinters. After discussing the news of the day, local antiquities and\r\nimprovements, there were certain topics, which possessed the secret of\r\nbeing to them eternally young, irresistibly attractive: the thrilling era\r\nof Colonel De Salaberry and General Sir Isaac Brock; the Canadian\r\n_Voltigeurs_, [76] the American War of 1812-14, where a few of these\r\nveterans had clanked their sabres and sported their epaulettes, &c. With\r\nthe exception of an esteemed and aged Quebec merchant, Long John Fraser,\r\nall now sleep the long sleep, under the green sward and leafy shades of\r\nMount Hermon or Belmont cemeteries, or in the moist vaults of some city\r\nmonastery.\r\n\r\nOn revisiting lately these once famous haunts of our forefathers, the new\r\nproprietor, ex-Mayor Tourangeau, courteously exhibited to us the\r\n_antiques_ of this heavy walled tenement, dating back possibly to the\r\nFrench _régime_, perhaps the second oldest house in St. John street.\r\nIn a freshly painted room, on the first story, in the east end, hung two\r\nancient oil paintings, executed years ago by a well-remembered artist,\r\nJos. Legaré, for the owners, two octogenarian inmates--his friends,\r\nMessrs. Michel and Charles Jourdain, architects and builders. They were\r\ncharged some seventy years ago with the construction of the District Court\r\nHouse (burnt in 1872) and City Jail (now the Morrin College.) Messrs.\r\nJourdain had emigrated to Canada after the French Revolution of 1789. They\r\nhad a holy horror of the guillotine, though, like others of the\r\n_literati_ of Quebec in former days, they were well acquainted with\r\nthe doctrines and works of Voltaire, Diderot, and d'Alembert. One of the\r\nJourdains, judging from his portrait, must have been a shrewd, observant\r\nman. Later on, the old tenement had sheltered the librarian of the\r\nLegislative Council, Monsieur Jourdain--a son--quite a _savant_ in\r\nhis way, and whose remains were escorted to their last resting place by\r\nthe _élite_ of the Canadian population. It is a mistake to think that\r\nculture and education were unknown in those early times; in some instances\r\nthe love of books prevailed to that degree that, in several French-\r\nCanadian families, manuscript copies then made at Quebec exist to this\r\nday, of the Latin and French classics from the difficulty of procuring\r\nbooks; there being little intercourse then with Paris book-stores, in\r\nfact, no importations of books. Among many quaint relics of the distant\r\ndays of the Messrs. Jourdain and of their successor, Monsieur Audiverti\r\n_dit_ Romain, we saw a most curiously inlaid _Marqueterie_ table, dating,\r\nwe might be tempted to assert, from the prehistoric era!\r\n\r\nInnumerable are the quaint, pious or historical souvenirs, mantling like\r\ngreen and graceful ivy, the lofty, fortified area, which comprises the\r\nUpper Town of this \"walled city of the North\". An incident of our early\r\ntimes--the outraged Crucifix of the Hôtel Dieu Convent, [77] and the\r\nMilitary Warrant, appropriating to urgent military wants, the revered seat\r\nof learning, the Jesuits' College, naturally claim a place in these pages.\r\nThe _Morning Chronicle_ will furnish us condensed accounts, which we\r\nwill try and complete:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _LE CRUCIFIX OUTRAGÉ._\r\n\r\n    \"An interesting episode in the history of Canada during the last\r\n    century attaches to a relic in the possession of the Reverend Ladies\r\n    of the Hôtel Dieu, or, more properly, \"the Hospital of the Most\r\n    Precious Blood of Jesus Christ,\" of which the following is a synopsis\r\n    taken from l'Abbé H. G. Casgrain's history of the institution:--\r\n\r\n    \"On the 5th October, 1742, it was made known that a soldier in the\r\n    garrison in Montreal, named Havard de Beaufort, professed to be a\r\n    sorcerer, and, in furtherance of his wicked pretensions, had profaned\r\n    sacred objects. He had taken a crucifix, and having besmeared it with\r\n    some inflammable substance--traces of which are still to be seen upon\r\n    it--had exposed it to the flames, whilst he at the same time recited\r\n    certain passages of the Holy Scripture. The sacrilege had taken place\r\n    in the house of one Charles Robidoux, at Montreal. Public indignation\r\n    at this profanation of the sacred symbol and of the Scripture was\r\n    intense; the culprit was arrested, tried and convicted, and sentenced\r\n    to make a public reparation, after which he was to serve three years\r\n    in the galleys. To this end he was led by the public executioner, with\r\n    a cord around his neck, bareheaded and barefooted, wearing only a long\r\n    shirt, and having a placard on his breast and back on which was\r\n    inscribed the legend \"Desecrator of holy things\" (_Profanateur des\r\n    choses saintes_), in front of the parish church in Montreal, and\r\n    being placed on his knees, he made the _amende honorable_ to God,\r\n    to the King and to Justice, and declared in a loud and intelligible\r\n    voice that he had rashly and wickedly desecrated the sacred image of\r\n    Jesus Christ, and had profaned the words of Holy Scripture. He was\r\n    then brought to all the cross-roads of the town, where he was scourged\r\n    by the public executioner, and afterwards lodged in prison to await\r\n    the sailing of the vessel which was to convey him to France, where he\r\n    was to undergo the remainder of his sentence. The Bishop of Quebec,\r\n    (whose vast diocese then included all of North America) immediately\r\n    wrote a letter to Montreal, inviting the people to make reparation by\r\n    penances and public prayers for the outrage committed, and ordering a\r\n    public procession from the parish church to that of Notre Dame de\r\n    Bonsecours, where the veneration of the cross took place. He then\r\n    obtained the crucifix from the magistrates, and forwarded it to the\r\n    reverend ladies of the Hôtel Dieu in Quebec, accompanied by a letter\r\n    in which he directed that it should be placed in their chapel, and\r\n    that on a certain day the veneration of it should be made in\r\n    reparation of the insult offered the Saviour of the world in his\r\n    sacred image on the cross. The nuns placed it in a reliquary, and to\r\n    this day it occupies a prominent position on the high altar. In virtue\r\n    of a brief of His Holiness the Pope, dated the 15th December, 1782, a\r\n    plenary indulgence was granted to any one who, having fulfilled the\r\n    usual conditions, should visit the Hôtel Dieu chapel on the first\r\n    Friday in March of each year. By an indult of the Supreme Pontiff,\r\n    dated 21st March, 1802, this indulgence was transferred to the first\r\n    Friday of October, when the veneration of the relic takes place\r\n    annually.\r\n\r\n    The cross is of some sort of dark wood, about five or six inches long,\r\n    bearing a brass figure of our Saviour, with the inscription I. N. R.\r\n    I. (_Jesus Nazarene Rex Judaeorum_) overhead and the skull and\r\n    cross-bones beneath. Attached to it is the certificate of authenticity\r\n    and the seal of the Bishop, Monseigneur de Pontbriand. In accordance\r\n    with this arrangement, public service was held in the chapel of the\r\n    hospital yesterday. The crucifix, enclosed in a gorgeous reliquary and\r\n    surrounded with a number of lighted tapers, flowers and other\r\n    ornaments, was placed on one of the lateral altars. Solemn mass was\r\n    sung at eight o'clock by the Rev. Mr. Rhéaume, of the Seminary, the\r\n    musical portion being rendered in a most impressive manner by the\r\n    reverend mothers, to organ accompaniment. In the afternoon, at two\r\n    o'clock, solemn vespers were chanted by the community, after which an\r\n    eloquent and impressive sermon was preached by Rev. Father Lepinto,\r\n    S.J., followed by the benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, which was\r\n    given, by Rev. Mr. Fraser, of the Seminary, who had previously read a\r\n    solemn form of \"Reparation\" in the name of all present, and in which\r\n    all joined. The _Tantum Ergo_ and other hymns were sung by the\r\n    nuns, and after the chanting of the CXVI. Psalm, the relic was\r\n    venerated, each one devoutly kissing it, during which the choir of\r\n    nuns sang the _Crux fidelis_. Altogether the ceremony was a very\r\n    impressive one, as was evidenced by the solemn, subdued manner of the\r\n    large congregation assembled.\"--(_Morning Chronicle_, _2nd Oct._,\r\n    1880.)\r\n\r\n    _THE JESUITS' BARRACKS._\r\n\r\n    \"At the present moment, in 1871, when, it is said, the Jesuits'\r\n    Barrack is on the eve of being returned to the Quebec authorities, our\r\n    readers will no doubt be pleased to learn how and when this valuable\r\n    property came into the possession of the Military Government. We are\r\n    indebted to J. M. LeMoine, Esq., President of the Literary and\r\n    Historical Society, for a copy of the ukase of Governor Murray\r\n    converting the old College of the Jesuits, on the Upper Town Market\r\n    Place, into a barrack, which it has remained ever since. It is\r\n    extracted from some rare old manuscripts belonging to that\r\n    institution. The orthographical mistakes exist in the original, and we\r\n    have allowed them to reappear:--\r\n\r\n    By His Excellency the Hon. James Murray, Esq., Capt. General and\r\n    Governor-in-Chief of the Province of Quebec and the territories\r\n    thereupon depending in America, Vice-Admiral of the same, Major-\r\n    General of His Majesty's Forces, and Colonel Commandant of the 2nd\r\n    Battalion of the Royal American Regiment of Foot, &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n    To Captain James Mitchelson, Captain William Martin, Lieut. Smith,\r\n    Messieurs Amiot, Boisseau and Moore:\r\n\r\n    Whereas it appears to me that proper Quarters and Barracks are much\r\n    wanted for the officers and troops in this garrison, and it being\r\n    apprehended that the Jesuits' College may be fitted up for that\r\n    purpose--You are hereby authorized and impowered to survey the same,\r\n    calling to your assistance such number of tradesmen as you may judge\r\n    necessary, in which survey, regard is to be had to a sufficient number\r\n    of Fire Places and Chimneys, to ascertain with precision the number of\r\n    officers and private soldiers the said College will contain, and to\r\n    make an estimate of the expense that will attend the repairs thereof.\r\n    And whereas the Contractors' provisions are at present lodged in the\r\n    said college, other magazines should be found to lodge the same. You\r\n    are therefore further impowered to inspect and survey that building\r\n    known by the name of the Intendant's Palace, and to ascertain also the\r\n    charges that will attend the fitting up the same to contain the\r\n    quantity of six thousand barrels, reporting to me on the back hereof\r\n    your proceedings upon the warrant, which shall be to you and every of\r\n    you sufficient authority.\r\n\r\n      Given under my hand and seal at Quebec, this 4th day of June, 1765.\r\n      (sd) JAS.

Sectry.\r\n\r\n    General Arnold's soldiers having during the winter of 1775 established\r\n    themselves in and near the French Intendant's Palace, facing the St.\r\n    Charles, Governor Carleton decided to sacrifice the stately pile of\r\n    buildings in order to dislodge the enemy. A lively fire was in\r\n    consequence opened from the guns on the ramparts, near Palace Gate,\r\n    and the magnificent structure was soon riddled with shot. It stood in\r\n    rear of Vallière's furniture factory and Boswell's brewery. Thus was\r\n    acquired the Jesuits' Barrack, and thus perished the Intendant's\r\n    Palace.\"--(_Chronicle_, 27_th Dec._, 1871.)\r\n\r\nD'Auteuil street, bounded to the west by an open space--the Esplanade--\r\nlined on one side by shade trees, on the other by the verdant slopes of\r\nthe glacis and city walls, deserves a passing notice. Bouchette describes\r\nit thus:--\"The Esplanade, between St. Louis and St. John's Gate, has a\r\nlength of 273 yards, by an average breadth of 80, except at the Ste.\r\nUrsula bastion, where it is 120 yards. It is tolerably level, in some\r\nplaces presenting a surface of bare rock. This is the usual place of\r\nparade for the troops of the garrison, from whence every morning in summer\r\nthe different guards of the town are mounted; in winter the Jesuits'\r\nBarracks drill ground is generally used for parades. The musters and\r\nannual reviews of the militia belonging to the city are held there. [78]\r\n\r\nThe Esplanade is still used as a parade ground, if not by our city militia\r\nby our provincial troops. Right well can we recall the manly form of the\r\nCommander of the \"B\" Battery, Lieut.-Colonel T. B. Strange, bestriding a\r\nnoble charger, putting his splendid, though not numerous corps, through\r\ntheir drill on the Esplanade. We have also sometimes caught sight there of\r\nour gay Volunteers. Occasionally these grounds are used by the divers\r\nlacrosse clubs for their athletic games--the _doyen_ of our city\r\n_littérateurs_, the Hon. P. J. O. Chauveau, in a graphic portraiture\r\nof the \"Quebec of the Past,\" has most feelingly retraced the vanished\r\nglories, the military pageants, the practical jokers, the City Watch, the\r\nsocial gatherings, which his youthful eyes witnessed of yore on the\r\nEsplanade and on Durham Terrace. We have attempted to render in English a\r\nstriking chapter of this sparkling effusion:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    _OLDEN TIMES IN THE ANCIENT CAPITAL._\r\n\r\n    \"There is not only the quaint city of Champlain--of Montmagny--of\r\n    Frontenac--of Bishop Laval--of Governor de Vaudreuil and Montcalm--of\r\n    Lord Dorchester and Colonel Dambourges--that is rapidly fading away;\r\n    there is not merely the grim fortress of the French _régime_, the\r\n    city of early English rule, disappearing piecemeal in the dissolving\r\n    shadows of the past. A much more modern town--newer even than that so\r\n    graphically pictured by our old friend Monsieur de Gaspé--the Quebec\r\n    of our boyhood--of our youth--the Quebec embalmed in the haunted\r\n    chambers of memory prior to 1837--it also each day seems retreating--\r\n    crumbling--evanescing.\r\n\r\n    Where are those dashing regiments which every Sunday at 4 p.m. (we\r\n    were not such Puritans then as now) paraded in the open space facing\r\n    the Esplanade walls, under the approving eye of the beauty and fashion\r\n    of all Quebec, assembled from outside and from inside of the walls--\r\n    the men proud of their bottle-green or dark-blue coats and white duck\r\n    pants--all the vogue then--while the softer sex and juveniles were\r\n    apparelled in the gayest of toilettes--brightest of colors--loudest of\r\n    contrasts: white--pink--green! How densely packed, our Esplanade!\r\n    Little boys and girls crowding in every corner of the lovely\r\n    precipitous lawn which, amphitheatre-like, stretches down--a hanging\r\n    garden of verdure and beauty. The splendid regimental bands of music,\r\n    the gaudily uniformed staff officers curvetting on their chargers,\r\n    with nodding plumes and heavy, glittering epaulettes (alas! the navy\r\n    now seems to have monopolised the gold lace for their shoulder-\r\n    straps), and those irresistible sappers with their bushy beards\r\n    heading the pageant, and those incomparable drum-majors, who could\r\n    fling high in the air their _batons_, and catch them so gracefully in\r\n    their descent. How their glittering coats did enrapture the crowd! All\r\n    these wondrous sights of our youth, where will we now find them?\r\n\r\n    The mounting guard, the _Grand Rounds_ at noon, when one of the\r\n    regimental bands (there were here nearly always two, and an honorable\r\n    rivalry existed between them) struck up a martial strain, whilst every\r\n    sentry in the city was relieved. What a treat this was to every one,\r\n    without forgetting the Seminary Externes (pupils), with their blue\r\n    coats and sashes of green or of variegated tints.\r\n\r\n    More than one of those lithesome youths came to grief for having\r\n    rushed away from the _Gradus ad Parnassum_ to those Elysian Fields,\r\n    ostensibly to hear the band--possibly to cast a sly glance at \"sweet\r\n    sixteen\" chatting with the _Militaires_ off duty. Here,\r\n    too, was the spot where amateurs came to hear new pieces of music--the\r\n    latest from London. Durham Terrace was the favoured locality from\r\n    whence the new waltz--the fashionable march--the latest opera--was\r\n    launched into city existence; from thence it found its way to the\r\n    _salons_ of the wealthy: such the history of _Di tanti palpiti_ and\r\n    other sweet emanations of great masters.\r\n\r\n    Where, now, are those squads of jolly tars, in navy blue,\r\n    irrepressible in their humors when on shore, far from the quarterdecks\r\n    of the trim frigates anchored under Cape Diamond: upsetting the cake-\r\n    stands, the spruce beer kegs--helping open-handed to the contents the\r\n    saucy street urchins, or, handing round, amidst the startled\r\n    wayfarers, pyramids of horse cakes, trays of barley-sugar and\r\n    peppermints, like real princes dispensing the coin of the realm. Where\r\n    are those noisy gangs of swaggering raftsmen--those _voyageurs_ from\r\n    the _pays d'en haut_, with their glittering costumes--hats festooned\r\n    with red or blue ribbons, sashes of variegated colors, barred shirts--\r\n    tightly wedged, three by three, in _calèches_, like Neapolitans--\r\n    patrolling the streets--interlarding a French song occasionally with\r\n    an oath, tolerably profane--at all times to be met, whether in the\r\n    light of day or the still hours of night. No police in those halcyon\r\n    days; but with the thickening shades of evening issued forth that\r\n    venerable brotherhood, the City Watch.\r\n\r\n    The watch, did we say? Where are now these dreamy wanderers of the\r\n    night, carolling forth, like the muezzin in Eastern cities, their\r\n    hourly calls, \"All's well!\" \"Fine night!\" \"Bad weather!\" as the case\r\n    might be--equally ready with their rattles to sound the dread alarm of\r\n    fire, or with their long _bâtons_ to capture belated midnight\r\n    brawlers, that is, when they saw they had a good chance of escaping\r\n    capture themselves. Their most formidable foes were not the thieves,\r\n    but the gay Lotharios and high-fed swells of the time, returning from\r\n    late dinners, and who made it a duty, nay, a crowning glory, to thrash\r\n    the Watch! Where now are those practical jokers who made collections\r\n    of door-knockers (the house-bell was not then known), exchanged sign-\r\n    boards from shop-doors, played unconscionable tricks on the simple-\r\n    minded peasants on market-days--surreptitiously crept in at suburban\r\n    balls, in the guise of the evil one, and, by the alarm they at times\r\n    created, unwittingly helped _Monsieur le Curé_ to frown down upon\r\n    these mundane junkettings.\r\n\r\n    One of these escapades is still remembered here. [79]\r\n\r\n    Four of these gentlemanly practical jokers, one night, habited in\r\n    black like the Prince of Darkness, drove silently through the suburbs\r\n    in a _cariole_ drawn by two coal-black steeds, and meeting with a\r\n    well-known citizen, overcome by drink, asleep in the snow, they\r\n    silently but vigorously seized hold of him with an iron grip; a\r\n    _cahot_ and physical pain having restored him to consciousness,\r\n    he devoutly _crossed_ himself, and, presto! was hurled into another\r\n    snow-drift. Next day all Quebec had heard in amazement how, when and\r\n    where Beelzebub and his infernal crew had been seen careering in state\r\n    after nightfall. Oh! the jolly days and gay nights of olden times!\r\n\r\n    But the past had other figures more deserving of our sympathy. The\r\n    sober-sided sires of the frolicsome gentry just described: the\r\n    respected tradesmen who had added dollar to dollar to build up an\r\n    independence--whose savings their children were squandering so\r\n    recklessly; those worthy citizens who had filled without stipend\r\n    numerous civic offices, with a zeal, a whole-heartedness seldom met\r\n    with in the present day--at once churchwardens, justices of the peace,\r\n    city fathers, members of societies for the promotion of agriculture,\r\n    of education, for the prevention of fires; who never sat up later than\r\n    nine of the clock p.m., except on those nights when they went to the\r\n    old Parliament Building to listen in awe to fiery Papineau or eloquent\r\n    Bourdages thunder against the _Bureaucracy_; who subscribed and\r\n    paid liberally towards every work of religion, of charity, of\r\n    patriotism; who every Saturday glanced with trembling eye over the\r\n    columns of the _Official Gazette_, to ascertain whether Government had\r\n    not dismissed them from the Militia or Commission of the Peace, for\r\n    having attended a public meeting, and having either proposed or\r\n    seconded a motion backing up Papineau and censuring the Governor.\r\n    Thrilling--jocund--simple war-like time of 1837, where art thou\r\n    flown?\"\r\n\r\nThe \"sunny Esplanade,\" the \"Club,\" the \"Platform,\" in those days \"rather\r\nsmall,\" the \"Rink,\" \"Montmorency Falls,\" \"Lake Charles,\" the \"Citadel\" and\r\nits \"hog's-back,\" it would appear, inspired the bard of the 25th King's\r\nOwn Borderers--for years forming part of our garrison--on this favourite\r\nregiment embarking for England, to waft to the old Rock the following\r\npoetic tribute.\r\n\r\n  _FAREWELL TO QUEBEC._\r\n\r\n  Adieu, ye joys of fair Quebec!\r\n  We've got what's coarsely termed the sack.\r\n  Adieu, kind homes that we have entered;\r\n  What hopes and joys are around ye centered!\r\n  Adieu, ye flights of Lower Town stairs!\r\n  To mount you often, no one cares.\r\n  Adieu, that Club, with cook whose skill\r\n  Makes none begrudge his dinner bill.\r\n  Adieu, O sunny Esplanade!\r\n  You suit us loungers to a shade.\r\n  Adieu, thou Platform, rather small,\r\n  For upper-ten, the band and all.\r\n  And Music Hall! adieu to thee!\r\n  Ne'er kinder audiences we'll see;\r\n  There on each 'Stadacona' night,\r\n  'Ye antient citie' proves its right\r\n  To boast of beauty, whose fair fame,\r\n  To us at Malta even came.\r\n  Adieu, O Rink, and 'thrilling steel,'\r\n  Another sort of thrill we feel,\r\n  As eye entranced, those forms we follow,\r\n  And see the Graces beaten hollow.\r\n  Adieu, John's Gate! your mud and mire\r\n  Must end in time, _as does each fire_!\r\n  Adieu, that pleasant four-mile round,\r\n  By bilious subs so useful found.\r\n  Adieu, Cathedral! and that choir,\r\n  All eye and ear could well desire.\r\n  Adieu, that service--half-past three\r\n  And chance walks after, home to tea.\r\n  And 'city fathers,' too, adieu!\r\n  Sorry we shan't know more of you.\r\n  Adieu, your daughters passing fair,\r\n  In dancing, skating, who so rare?\r\n  Adieu, too soon, O Citadel!\r\n  Adieu, hogs-back, we like thee well,\r\n  Though when on _poudré_ days we've crossed,\r\n  Noses and ears we've all but lost.\r\n  Adieu, to Montmorency's Fall!\r\n  Adieu, ye ice-cones large and small!\r\n  Who can forget the _traîneau's_ leap\r\n  From off that icy height, so steep;\r\n  It takes your breath as clean away\r\n  As plunge in air--at best you may\r\n  Get safely down, and borne along,\r\n  Run till upset; but ah! if wrong\r\n  At first, you take to turning round,\r\n  The _traîneau_ leaves you, and you're found\r\n  Down at the bottom, rolling still,\r\n  Shaken and bruised and feeling ill.\r\n  Adieu, ye lakes and all the fishing!\r\n  To cast a fly we've long been wishing.\r\n  One last adieu! sorry are we\r\n  That this must be our p.p.c.!\r\n  Folly to think we'll feel resigned\r\n  In leaving you, who've proved so kind.\r\n  Our bark of happiness goes wreck,\r\n  In quitting you, far-famed Quebec!\r\n                _--P.P.C., of the 25th K.O.B._\r\n\r\nOur thoroughfares, our promenades, even in those dreary months, when the\r\nnorthern blast howls over the Canadian landscape, have some blithsome\r\ngleams of sunshine. Never shall we forget one bright, frosty January\r\nafternoon,  about four o'clock, in the year 1872, when solitary, though\r\nnot sad, standing on Durham [80] Terrace, was unveiled to us \"a most\r\nmagnificent picture, a scene of glorified nature painted by the hand of\r\nthe Creator. The setting sun had charged the skies with all its gorgeous\r\nheraldry of purple and crimson and gold, and the tints were diffused and\r\nreflected through fleecy clouds, becoming softer and richer through\r\nexpansion. The mountain tops, wood-crowned, where the light and shadow\r\nappeared to be struggling for mastery, stood out in relief from the white\r\nplain, and stretching away in indistinct, dreamy distances finally seemed\r\nto blend with the painted skies. The ice-covered bay was lit up with\r\nglowing shades, in contrast with the deep blue of the clear water beyond;\r\nfrom which the island rose, and into which the point jutted with grand\r\npicturesqueness; the light played through the frost-adorned, but still\r\nsombre pines, and spread out over deserted fields. Levis and the south\r\nshore received not so much of the illumination, and the grimness of the\r\nCitadel served as a contrast and a relief to the eye bewildered with the\r\nunaccustomed grandeur. But as the sun sank deeper behind the eternal\r\nhills, shadows began to fall, and the bright colours toned down to the\r\ngrey of dusk, stars shone out, the grey was chased away, and the azure,\r\ndiamond-dotted skies told not of the glory of sunset which had so shortly\r\nbefore suffused them.\"--(_Morning Chronicle_.)\r\n\r\nWe have just seen described the incomparable panorama which a winter\r\nsunset disclosed from the lofty promenade, to which the Earl of Dufferin\r\nhas bequeathed his name. Let us now accompany one of our genial summer\r\nbutterflies, fluttering through the mazes of old Stadacona escorting a\r\nbride; let us listen to W. D. Howells in the WEDDING JOURNEY. \"Nothing, I\r\nthink, more enforces the illusion of Southern Europe in Quebec than the\r\nSunday-night promenading on the Durham (now Dufferin) Terrace. This is the\r\nample span on the brow of the cliff to the left of the Citadel, the\r\nnoblest and most commanding position in the whole city, which was formerly\r\noccupied by the old Castle of St. Louis, where dwelt the brave Count\r\nFrontenac and his splendid successors of the French _régime_. The\r\ncastle went the way of Quebec by fire some forty years ago (23rd January,\r\n1834), and Lord Durham levelled the site and made it a public promenade. A\r\nstately arcade of solid masonry supports it on the brink of the rock, and\r\nan iron parapet incloses it; there are a few seats to lounge upon, and\r\nsome idle old guns for the children to clamber over and play with. A soft\r\ntwilight had followed the day, and there was just enough obscurity to hide\r\nfrom a willing eye the Northern and New World facts of the scene, and to\r\nleave in more romantic relief the citadel dark against the mellow evening,\r\nand the people gossiping from window to window across the narrow streets\r\nof the Lower Town. The Terrace itself was densely thronged, and there was\r\na constant coming and going of the promenaders, and each formally paced\r\nback and forth upon the planking for a certain time, and then went quietly\r\nhome, giving place to new arrivals. They were nearly all French, and they\r\nwere not generally, it seemed, of the first fashion, but rather of\r\nmiddling condition in life; the English being represented only by a few\r\nyoung fellows, and now and then a red-faced old gentleman with an Indian\r\nscarf trailing from his hat. There were some fair American costumes and\r\nfaces in the crowd, but it was essentially Quebecian. The young girls,\r\nwalking in pairs, or with their lovers, had the true touch of provincial\r\nunstylishness, the young men had the ineffectual excess of the second-rate\r\nLatin dandy, the elder the rude inelegance of a _bourgeoisie_ in them; but\r\na few better-figured _avocats_ or _notaires_ (their profession was as\r\nunmistakable as if they carried their well-polished door-plates upon their\r\nbreasts), walked and gravely talked with each other. The non-American\r\ncharacter of the scene was not less vividly marked in the fact, that each\r\nperson dressed according to his own taste, and frankly indulged private\r\nshapes and colours. One of the promenaders was in white, even to his\r\ncanvas shoes; another, with yet bolder individuality, appeared in perfect\r\npurple. It had a strange, almost portentous effect when these two\r\nstartling figures met as friends and joined with each other in the\r\npromenade with united arms; but the evening was beginning to darken round\r\nthem, and presently the purple comrade was merely a sombre shadow beside\r\nthe glimmering white.\r\n\r\nThe valleys and the heights now vanished; but the river defined itself by\r\nthe varicolored light of the ships and steamers that lay, dark, motionless\r\nhulks upon its broad breast; the lights of Point Levis swarmed upon the\r\nother shore; the Lower Town, two hundred feet below them, stretched an\r\nalluring mystery of clustering roofs and lamp-lit windows, and dark and\r\nshining streets around the mighty rock, mural-crowned. Suddenly a\r\nspectacle peculiarly Northern and characteristic of Quebec revealed\r\nitself; a long arch brightened over the northern horizon; the tremulous\r\nflames of the aurora, pallid violet or faintly tinged with crimson, shot\r\nupward from it, and played with a vivid apparition and evanescence to the\r\nzenith. While the stranger looked, a gun boomed from the Citadel, and the\r\nwild, sweet notes of the bugle sprang out upon the silence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE LOWER TOWN._\r\n\r\nOn bidding adieu to the lofty plateau which constitutes the Upper Town, on\r\nour way to an antiquarian ramble in the narrow, dusty, or muddy\r\nthoroughfares of the Lower (as it was formerly styled) the Low Town, we\r\nshall cast a glance, a glance only, at the facade of the City Post Office,\r\non the site of which, until razed in 1871, stood that legendary, haunted\r\nold house, \"LE CHIEN D'OR.\" Having fully described it elsewhere, [81] let\r\nus hurry on, merely looking up as we pass, to the gilt tablet and\r\ninscription and its golden dog, gnawing his bone, pretty much as he\r\nappeared one hundred and twenty-two years ago, to Capt. John Knox, of the\r\n43rd Regt., on his entering Quebec, after its capitulation on the 18th\r\nSeptember, 1759. History has indeed shed very little light on the Golden\r\nDog and its inscription since that date, but romance has seized hold of\r\nhim, and Kirby, Marmette, Soulard and others have enshrined both with the\r\nhalo of their imagination. In 1871 the corner stone of the \"Chien d'Or\"\r\nwas unearthed; a leaden plate disclosed the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n                          \"NICOLAS LAQUIN\r\n                           Dit PHILIBER,\r\n                       _M'a posé le 2e Aoust,_\r\n                                1735.\"\r\n\r\nWe clip the following from KNOX'S JOURNAL, of the siege of Quebec in 1759,\r\nat which he was both an actor and an eye-witness:--\r\n\r\n    \"On the right of the descent, leading to the low town, stands a\r\n    stately old house, said to be the first built of stone in this city\r\n    (Quebec), and over the front door of it is engraved a dog gnawing a\r\n    large, fleshy bone, which he has got under and between his fore-feet,\r\n    with the following whimsical inscription:--\r\n\r\n      \"Je suis le chien qui ronge l'os,\r\n      Sans en perdre an seul morceau;\r\n      Le temp viendra, qui n'est pas venu,\r\n      Je mordrai celui, qui m'aura mordû.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The true meaning of this device I never could learn, though I made\r\n    all possible inquiries, without being gratified with the least\r\n    information respecting its allusion. I have been informed that the\r\n    first proprietor of the house was a man of great natural abilities,\r\n    and possessed a plentiful fortune, which he, after many\r\n    disappointments and losses in trade, had scraped together by means of\r\n    the most indefatigable industry. Now, whether the foregoing device had\r\n    any reference to these particulars of his own private affairs, or that\r\n    we may rather suppose the bone with flesh on it to resemble Canada,\r\n    and the dog an emblem of fidelity, to represent the French settled\r\n    there as if determined faithfully to defend that colony for their King\r\n    and country against the savage natives, who may perhaps be alluded to\r\n    by the two last lines of the inscription, I will not take upon me to\r\n    determine, but submit it to the more penetrating capacity of the\r\n    curious reader.\"--(KNOX'S JOURNAL, Vol. II., p. 149.)\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of arriving at this El Dorado of commerce: an easy,\r\nexpeditious, and, it is believed a safe passage, originated by our\r\nenterprising fellow-townsman, W. A. G. Griffith, Esq.--the _Terrace\r\nElevator_. The ascent or descent by the elevator occupies fifty seconds\r\nof time, at the moderate cost of three cents per head. The elevator,\r\nopened to the public on 10th February, 1880, was erected at a cost of\r\nabout $30,000. Whether it is placed in the most suitable spot remains to\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THE ELEVATOR._\r\n\r\n    \"The elevator is worked by the weight of water; this necessitates\r\n    there always being a sufficient supply in the tank at the top of the\r\n    incline, which is pumped by a 12-horse-power steam pump from a large\r\n    tank at the foot. The _modus operandi_ is as follows: Suppose a\r\n    person enters the car at the foot of the incline to be carried to the\r\n    top, the bell-boy at once rings a bell to notify the brakesman to go\r\n    ahead; weight is required to bring the car and passenger from the foot\r\n    to the top, and both cars being built on tanks with necessary valves\r\n    for the entrance of the water from the upper tank and for the exit of\r\n    the same water when it reaches the bottom of the track, which the\r\n    large tank below receives, the brakesman proceeds to open one of the\r\n    water valves and allows sufficient water to enter the car tank until\r\n    it outweighs the car and passengers at the foot; the cars are now\r\n    supposed to be in motion, with the bell-boy at the foot and brakesman\r\n    at the top of the incline, who duties are to watch that everything\r\n    runs smoothly and that the track is clear of all obstructions. Nothing\r\n    can happen inside the cars during the transit that is not noticed by\r\n    the employés; now let us suppose that while in motion one of the\r\n    cables breaks, there is a second cable to take all the strain, which\r\n    is never over five tons, and each cable will lift at least 30 tons,\r\n    but should it happen by some extraordinary oversight that there\r\n    existed flaws in the cables which had not been noticed, so that first\r\n    one cable broke and then the second also broke, it would probably be\r\n    thought that an accident must occur. No such catastrophe would happen,\r\n    because under the cars and out of sight there are two enormously\r\n    strong chisels bolted to the iron tank, and running within half an\r\n    inch of the trestle work; immediately the strain is taken off the\r\n    cables, or immediately the two cables break, the two chisels would\r\n    enter the strong wooden beams that support the iron rails and hold the\r\n    cars firmly in position. Finally, let us suppose that these chisels\r\n    also gave way, it must be said surely an accident is now inevitable;\r\n    but no, for at the top as well as at the foot of the track there are\r\n    two air buffers, against which the cars strike on their ascent and\r\n    descent. So nicely adjusted are they, and so ingeniously are they\r\n    constructed, that although the cars may descend with great force\r\n    against these air buffers, the resistance being gradually developed as\r\n    the air compresses, there will be but little, if any, extra shock.\r\n    Should the brakesman happen to be absent from his post, we are\r\n    informed by the Manager that no irregularities would occur in\r\n    consequence, as a governor regulates the speed at which the cars are\r\n    to go, and on their arrival the air buffers come into play and receive\r\n    them. So well has the brakesman the cars under his control that at one\r\n    stroke of the bell he can stop them instantaneously wherever they may\r\n    be on the track. The brakes are arranged in such a way that it would\r\n    seem to be quite impossible for both of them to be out of order at the\r\n    same time; but even if they were, nothing could happen, as the air\r\n    buffers would check the force of any extra shock. It may be thought\r\n    that an enormous quantity of water must be used to work this\r\n    machinery, seeing that there is a 5,000 gallon water-tank at the top\r\n    of the incline and a 10,000 gallon tank at the foot, but such is not\r\n    the case, the water which is pumped up from the lower to the upper\r\n    tank returns again to the lower one, and so the same water is used\r\n    over and over again; indeed, the amount of water wasted is not nearly\r\n    as much as is consumed by a private family. In confirmation of this\r\n    statement, only a halt-inch tap is used to supply the tanks, and the\r\n    Manager informs us that frequently for days together the tap is not\r\n    turned on either at night or day.\"\r\n\r\nHow our worthy grandfathers would have shrugged their shoulders had such\r\nan innovation been mooted eighty years ago. The other mode of penetrating\r\ninto the Lower Town is through that steep and tortuous hill--called\r\nMountain Hill by the English, Côte de la Montagne by the French.\r\n\r\nThis is the hill which has re-echoed the tread of so many regiments, on\r\nwhich so many Governors, French and English, have, on divers occasions,\r\nheard themselves enthusiastically cheered by eager crowds; the hill which\r\nViceroys of France and of England, from the ostentatious Marquis de Tracy\r\nto the proud Earl of Durham, ascended on their way to Government House,\r\nsurrounded by their brilliant staffs and saluted by cannon and with\r\nwarlike flourish of trumpets! In earlier times the military and religious\r\ndisplay was blended with an aroma of literature and elaborate Indian\r\noratory, combining prose and poetry.\r\n\r\nFrancis Parkman will tell us of what took place on the arrival, on the\r\n28th July, 1658, of the Viscount D'Argenson, the Governor of the colony:--\r\n\"When Argenson arrived to assume the government, a curious greeting had\r\nawaited him. The Jesuits asked him to dine; vespers followed the repast;\r\nand then they conducted him to a hall where the boys of their school--\r\ndisguised, one as the Genius of New France, one as the Genius of the\r\nForest, and others as Indians of various friendly tribes--made him\r\nspeeches by turn, in prose and in verse. First, Pierre du Quet, who played\r\nthe Genius of New France, presented his Indian retinue to the Governor, in\r\na complimentary harangue. Then four other boys, personating French\r\ncolonists, made him four flattering addresses, in French verse. Charles\r\nDenis, dressed as a Huron, followed, bewailing the ruin of his people, and\r\nappealing to Argenson for aid. Jean François Bourdon, in the character of\r\nan Algonquin, next advanced on the platform, boasted his courage, and\r\ndeclared that he was ashamed to cry like the Huron. The Genius of the\r\nForest now appeared, with a retinue of wild Indians from the interior,\r\nwho, being unable to speak French, addressed the Governor in their native\r\ntongues, which the Genius proceeded to interpret. Two other boys in the\r\ncharacter of prisoners just escaped from the Iroquois, then came forward\r\nimploring aid in piteous accents; and in conclusion the whole troop of\r\nIndians from far and near laid their bows and arrows at the feet of\r\nArgenson, and hailed him as their chief.\r\n\r\nBesides these mock Indians, a crowd of genuine savages had gathered at\r\nQuebec to greet the new \"Ononthio.\" On the next day--at his own cost, as\r\nhe writes to a friend--he gave them a feast, consisting of seven large\r\nkettlesful of Indian corn, peas, prunes, sturgeon, eels and fat, which\r\nthey devoured, he says, after having first sung me a song, after their\r\nfashion.\"\r\n\r\nProbably one of the most gorgeous displays on record was that attending\r\nthe arrival of the great Marquis of Tracy, in 1665. He came with a\r\nbrilliant staff, a crowd of young nobles; and accompanied by two hundred\r\nsoldiers, to be followed by a thousand more of the dashing regiment of\r\nCarignan-Salières. He sailed up the St. Lawrence, and on the 30th of June,\r\n1665, anchored in the basin of Quebec. The broad, white standard, blazoned\r\nwith the arms of France, proclaimed the representative of royalty; and\r\nPoint Levi and Cape Diamond and the distant Cape Tourmente roared back the\r\nsound of saluting cannon. All Quebec was on the ramparts or at the landing\r\nplace, and all eyes were strained at the two vessels as they slowly\r\nemptied their crowded decks into the boats alongside. The boats at length\r\ndrew near, and the Lieutenant-General and his suite landed on the quay\r\nwith a pomp such as Quebec had never seen before.\r\n\r\nTracy was a veteran of sixty-two, portly and tall, \"one of the largest men\r\nI ever saw,\" writes Mother Mary (Marie de l'Incarnation), but he was\r\nsallow with disease, for fever had seized him, and it had fared ill with\r\nhim on the long voyage. The Chevalier de Chaumont walked at his side, and\r\nyoung nobles surrounded him, gorgeous in lace and ribbons, and majestic in\r\nleonine wigs. Twenty-four guards in the King's livery led the way,\r\nfollowed by four pages and six valets; [82] and thus, while the Frenchmen\r\nshouted and the Indians stared, the august procession threaded the streets\r\nof the Lower Town, and climbed the steep pathway that scaled the cliffs\r\nabove. Breathing hard, they reached the top, passed on the left the\r\ndilapidated walls of the Fort and the shed of mingled wood and masonry\r\nwhich then bore the name of the Castle de St. Louis; passed on the right\r\nthe old house of Couillard and the site of Laval's new Seminary, and soon\r\nreached the square betwixt the Jesuit College and the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe bells were ringing in a frenzy of welcome. Laval in pontificals,\r\nsurrounded by priests and Jesuits, stood waiting to receive the Deputy of\r\nthe King, and as he greeted Tracy and offered him the holy water, he\r\nlooked with anxious curiosity to see what manner of man he was. The signs\r\nwere auspicious. The deportment of the Lieutenant-General left nothing to\r\ndesire. A _prie-dieu_ had been placed for him. He declined it. They\r\noffered him a cushion, but he would not have it, and fevered as he was, he\r\nknelt on the bare pavement with a devotion that edified every beholder.\r\n_Te Deum_ was sung and a day of rejoicing followed. [83]\r\n\r\nIn our day, we can recall but one pageant at all equal: the roar of\r\ncannon, &c., attending the advent of the great Earl of Durham, [84] but\r\nthere were noticeable fewer \"priests,\" fewer \"Jesuits,\" and less\r\n\"kneeling\" in the procession. There was something oriental in the vice-\r\nregal pageantry. Line-of-battle ships--stately frigates, twelve in number\r\n--the _Malabar_, _Hastings_, _Cornwallis_, _Inconstant_, _Hercules_,\r\n_Pique_, _Charybdis_, _Pearl_, _Vestal_, _Medea_, _Dee_ and _Andromache_\r\nvisited that summer our shores, a suitable escort to the able, proud,\r\nhumane, [85] but unlucky Viceroy and High Commissioner, with his clever\r\nadvisers--the Turtons, Bullers, Wakefields, Hansomes, Derbyshires,\r\nDunkins, _cum multis aliis_. The Dictator was determined to \"make a\r\ncountry or mar a career.\" He has left us a country.\r\n\r\nThat warlike, though festive summer of 1838, with our port studded with\r\nthree-deckers and spanking frigates, was long remembered in the annals of\r\nthe _bon ton_. Some men-of-war were in especial favour. A poetical\r\nlament by the Quebec ladies was wafted to the departing officers of H. M.\r\nfrigate _Inconstant_, the words by the Laureate of the period, George\r\nW. Wicksteed, of Ottawa. This effusion includes the names of every vessel\r\nin the fleet _in italics_, and of several of the officers.\r\n\r\n  _THE LADIES' ADDRESS TO THE INCONSTANTS._\r\n  _Written by G. W. Wicksteed._\r\n\r\n  We saw the _Hastings_ hasting off,\r\n    And never made a fuss.\r\n  The _Malabar's_ departure waked\r\n    No malady in us.\r\n\r\n  We were not piqued to lose the _Pique_;\r\n    Each lady's heart at ease is,\r\n  Altho' the _Dees_ are on the seas,\r\n    And gone the _Hercules_--es.\r\n\r\n  Our parting with the _Andromache_\r\n    Like Hector's not at all is;\r\n  Nor are we Washingtons to seek\r\n    To capture a _Cornwallis_.\r\n\r\n  And no _Charybdis_ ever caught\r\n    Our hearts in passion's whirls;\r\n  There's not a girl among us all\r\n    Has ever fished for _Pearls_.\r\n\r\n  The _Vestals_ with their sacred flame\r\n    Were not the sparks we wanted;\r\n  We've looked _Medeas_ in the face,\r\n    And yet were not enchanted.\r\n\r\n  But when our dear _Inconstants_ go,\r\n    Our grief shall know no bounds,\r\n  The dance shall have no joy for us,\r\n    The song no merry sounds.\r\n\r\n  All dismal then shall be the waltz,\r\n    The dull quadrille as bad,\r\n  And wearily we'll hurry through\r\n    The joyless galopade.\r\n\r\n  We'll gaze upon each changeful cloud\r\n    As through the air it skims,\r\n  We'll think of fickle fortune's wheel,\r\n    And fashion's turns and whims--\r\n\r\n  Sweet emblems of _Inconstancy_\r\n    In each of these we'll find,\r\n  And our _Inconstants_ constantly\r\n    We'll fondly bear in mind.\r\n\r\n  And spite of Durham's fetes and balls,\r\n    We'll pine and mourn and mope\r\n  Our long, long winter season through,\r\n    As girls without a _Hope_.\r\n\r\n  And when the spring shall come again,\r\n    Our hearts, to pleasure dead,\r\n  Shall sigh for spring without an S,\r\n    And wish for _Pring_ instead.\r\n\r\n  Unless, indeed, sweet spring with _Hope_\r\n    Those hearts again should bless,\r\n  And bring our dear _Inconstants_ back,\r\n    And spring without an S.\r\n                       Quebec, 6th July, 1838.\r\n\r\n(From _Waifs in Verse_, by G. W. Wicksteed, Q.C., Law Clerk, House of\r\nCommons of Canada, 1878.)\r\n\r\nTo which melting address the \"Inconstants,\" on their way to Britain,\r\nfeelingly replied. Our space allows us to insert but a few stanzas of this\r\npoetical lament.\r\n\r\n  All language fails to tell how much\r\n    We value your address,\r\n  Or say how deeply we partake\r\n    The feelings you express.\r\n\r\n  Those _Hastings_ are a hasty set,\r\n    And left you in a hurry;\r\n  Those _Malabars_ are malapert,\r\n    And hot as Indian curry.\r\n\r\n  Be true, and then the breath of May\r\n    Shall fill our sails and bring\r\n  Our willing steps and eager hearts,\r\n    And _Spring_--and _Pring_--and _Ring_.\r\n\r\n  And each of you for one of ours\r\n    Shall change her maiden name,\r\n  And as we are all _Inconstants_, you\r\n    Of course will be the same.\r\n                         Kamouraska, August, 1838.\r\n\r\nHere we stand on the principal artery of the commerce of the city, St.\r\nPeter street, having a width of only twenty-four feet. St. Peter street is\r\nprobably not so ancient as its sister, Sault-au-Matelot street. St. Peter\r\nstreet was so named in memory of Messire Pierre le Voyer d'Argenson, who,\r\nin 1658, came to Quebec as successor to M. de Lauzon. M. d'Argenson was,\r\nin 1661, succeeded by the Baron d'Avaugour.\r\n\r\nOn the site on which the Quebec Bank [86] was erected in 1863, there stood\r\nthe offices, the vaults, and the wharf of the well-known merchant, John\r\nLymburner. There were three Lymburners: John, lost at sea in the fall of\r\n1775, Mathew, and Adam, the most able of the three; they were, no doubt\r\nrelated to each other. The loyalty of Adam, towards the British Crown, in\r\n1775, was more than suspected; his oratorical powers, however, and his\r\nknowledge of constitutional law, made him a fit delegate to England in\r\n1791, to plead the cause of the colony before the Metropolitan\r\nauthorities. His speech on the occasion is reported in the _Canadian\r\nReview_, published at Montreal in 1826.\r\n\r\nColonel Henry Caldwell states that, in 1775, Governor Guy Carleton had\r\nordered a cannon to be pointed from the wharf on which stood Lymburner's\r\nhouse, with the intention to open fire upon the _Bostonais_, should\r\nthey attempt a surprise on the Sault-au-Matelot quarter. Massive and\r\nstrongly built stone vaults (probably of French origin), are still extant\r\nbeneath the house adjoining, to the south of this last, belonging to the\r\nheirs Atkinson.\r\n\r\nOn the site of the offices of Mr. McGie stood, in 1759, the warehouse of\r\nM. Perrault, _l'aîné_, from a great number of letters and invoice-bills\r\nfound in the garret, and which a friend [87] has placed at our disposal,\r\nit would seem that M. Perrault had extensive commercial relations both in\r\nCanada and in France. A curious letter to M. Perrault, from Bigot's\r\nnotorious councillor, Estebe, then in Bordeaux, was found in this\r\ntenement. It discloses a sad state of things in Old France. This old\r\ndocument dates of 24th February, 1760, a few months subsequent to the\r\nBattle of the Plains and a few weeks prior to that of Ste. Foye, in April,\r\n1760.\r\n\r\n    \"BORDEAUX, 24th February, 1760.\r\n\r\n    \"_To Monsieur Perrault,_\r\n\r\n    Quebec:\r\n\r\n    \"SIR,--It was with heartfelt pleasure I received your favour of the\r\n    7th November last, since, in spite of your misfortunes, it apprized me\r\n    of the fact that both you and your lady were well.\r\n\r\n    \"I feel grateful for the sympathy you express in our troubles during\r\n    our passage from Quebec to Bordeaux. I wish I could as easily forget\r\n    the misfortunes of Canada as I do the annoyances we suffered on the\r\n    voyage.\r\n\r\n    \"We learned, _via_ England, by the end of October last, the\r\n    unfortunate fate of Quebec. You can imagine how we felt on hearing of\r\n    such dreadful news I could  contain neither my tears nor my regrets on\r\n    learning the loss of a city and country to which I owe everything, and\r\n    to which I am as sincerely attached as any of the natives. We\r\n    flattered ourselves that the silence the English had kept during all\r\n    last summer on their operation was of good omen for us, and that they\r\n    would be ignominiously compelled to raise the siege; we had even an\r\n    indistinct knowledge of the repulse they had met with at Montmorency\r\n    (31st July, 1759); we knew that our troops followed them closely\r\n    wherever they attempted to land. We have erred like you in the hopes\r\n    we cherished. What fatality, what calamity and how many events unknown\r\n    to us have led to your downfall? You do not know, my dear Sir, of the\r\n    extent of your misfortunes. You imagine that the loss of the remainder\r\n    of the colony is close at hand. You are right. This cannot be\r\n    otherwise, since the relief which is sent to you from France cannot\r\n    prevent that. The small help which Canadians expected from the payment\r\n    of some Treasury notes is taken away from them; none are paid since\r\n    the 15th of October last. This, then, is the overwhelming blow to all\r\n    our hopes! The Treasury notes of the other colonies are generally in\r\n    the same predicament; the King pays none, and the nation groans under\r\n    taxation. No credit, no confidence, anywhere; no commerce nor\r\n    shipments; a general bankruptcy in all the cities of France. The\r\n    kingdom is in the greatest desolation possible. Our armies have been\r\n    beaten everywhere; our navy no more exists--our ships have been either\r\n    captured or burnt on the coasts where the enemy has driven them\r\n    ashore, Admiral de Conflans having been defeated in getting out of the\r\n    harbor of Brest. In one word, we are in a state of misery and\r\n    humiliation without precedent. The finances of the King are in fearful\r\n    disorder; he has had to send his plate to the Mint. The _Seigneurs_\r\n    have followed his example, and private individuals are compelled to\r\n    sell their valuables in order to live and pay the onerous taxes which\r\n    weigh on them. At the present moment, by Royal order, an inventory is\r\n    being taken of the silver of all the churches of the kingdom. No doubt\r\n    it will have to be sent to the Mint, and payment will be made when\r\n    that of the Treasury notes takes place--that is, _when it pleases\r\n    God_. Such is a summary of what now occurs here. How I regret, my dear\r\n    Sir, the merry days I spent in Canada! I would like to be there still\r\n    if matters were as formerly. I could own a _turn-out_ there, whereas I\r\n    go on foot, like a dog, through the mud of Bordeaux, where I certainly\r\n    do not live in the style I did in Quebec. Please God this iron age may\r\n    soon end! We flattered ourselves this winter that peace would soon be\r\n    proclaimed; it is much talked of, but I see no signs of it. It will,\r\n    it is said, require another campaign to complete the ruin, and to\r\n    postpone more and more the payment of the Treasury notes. What will be\r\n    the ultimate fate of these bills is very hard to say. It is unlikely\r\n    any settlement of them will be made before peace is concluded. My\r\n    opinion is that nothing will be lost on the bills, which are\r\n    registered, but I cannot say the same of the exchange, which is not\r\n    registered, since payment has been stopped. The Government has refused\r\n    to register any bills, even some which had been sent to me, and which\r\n    were payable in 1758. I negotiated some registered ones here and in\r\n    Paris at 50 per cent. discount. Non-registered ones are valueless, and\r\n    you get few purchasers even for registered bills. Four richly laden\r\n    vessels belonging to the West India Company (_Compagnie des Indes_)\r\n    have arrived lately. This was very opportune, as the Company was\r\n    rather shaky. However, it never failed to pay the \"Beaver Bills,\" and\r\n    has even accepted those which had not yet fallen due. Our affairs on\r\n    the coast of Coromandel are like the rest--in a bad way. Fears are\r\n    entertained for Pondicherry. The English are arming a large expedition\r\n    for Martinique. That island will have the same fate as Guadeloupe. The\r\n    succor sent out to you, if ever it reaches you, of which I doubt,\r\n    consists in six merchant ships, laden with 1,600 tons of provisions,\r\n    some munitions of war, and 400 soldiers from Isle Royal. I believe\r\n    this relief is sent to you more through a sense of honour than from\r\n    any desire (as none exists) to help you. Many flatter themselves you\r\n    will retake Quebec this winter. I wish you may, but I do not believe\r\n    you will. This would require to be undertaken by experienced and\r\n    determined men, and even then such attempts fail. [88] Remember me to\r\n    your dear wife. Kiss my little friend (your boy) for me. I reserve him\r\n    when he comes to France a gilt horse and a silver carriage. My wife\r\n    and family beg to be remembered.\r\n\r\n      Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n      (Sd) ESTEBE.\r\n\r\n    P.S.--Your brother is always at La Rochelle. Since I am at Bordeaux,\r\n    out of 80 vessels which left South America, one only has arrived here.\r\n    You can fancy how trade stagnates. A singular distrust exists\r\n    everywhere. The exchange of ---- and other good houses is refused.\r\n    Those who want to remit to Paris have to get their specie carried.\r\n\r\n      6th March, 1760.\r\n\r\n    The hospital of Toulouse is just short of nine millions. Bankrupts\r\n    everywhere merchants and others.\r\n\r\nSt. Peter street has become the general headquarters of the most important\r\ncommerce, and of life insurance and fire assurance offices. The financial\r\ninstitutions are there proudly enthroned: the Bank of Montreal (founded in\r\n1818 and incorporated in 1828), Bank of Quebec (founded in 1817), the\r\nUnion Bank (founded in 1865), the Banque Nationale (founded in 1873), the\r\nBank of British North America (founded in 1836, incorporated in 1840,\r\nopened at Quebec in 1837), the Merchants' Bank (founded in 1861).\r\n\r\nIn this street resided, in 1774, the Captain Bouchette, who, in the\r\nfollowing year, in his little craft, _Le Gaspé_, brought us back our\r\nbrave Governor, Guy Carleton; M. Bouchard, merchant, M. Panet, N.P. (the\r\nfather of His Lordship, Bishop B.C. Panet), as also M. Boucher, Harbor\r\nMaster of Quebec, \"(who was appointed to that post by the Governor, Sir R.\r\nS. Milnes, on the recommendation of the Duke of Kent.).\" [89] Boucher had\r\npiloted the vessel, having on board the 7th Regiment, (the Duke's), from\r\nQuebec to Halifax.\r\n\r\nThe office in which the _Quebec Morning Chronicle_ has been published\r\nsince 1847, belonged in 1759 to M. Jean Taché, \"President of the\r\nMercantile Body,\" \"an honest, and sensible man,\" as appears by _Mémoirs\r\nsur le Canada_, (1749-60). One of our first poets, he composed a poem\r\n\"_On the Sea_.\" The ancestor of the late Sir E. P. Taché, and of the\r\nnovelist, Jos. Marmette and others, he possessed, at that period,\r\nextensive buildings on the Napoleon wharf, which were destroyed by fire in\r\n1845, and a house in the country, on the Ste. Foye road, afterwards called\r\n\"Holland House,\" after Major Samuel Holland, our first Provincial\r\nSurveyor-General, whose services as surveyor and engineer were\r\nsubsequently so conspicuous at Quebec and at Prince Edward Island.\r\n\r\nThe _Chronicle_ building, during nearly half a century, was a coffee\r\nhouse, much frequented by sea-faring men, known as the \"Old Neptune\" Inn.\r\nThe effigy of the sea-god, armed with his formidable trident, placed over\r\nthe main entrance, seemed to threaten the passers-by. We can remember, as\r\nyesterday, his colossal proportions. \"Old Neptune\" [90] has disappeared\r\nabout thirty years back.\r\n\r\n     _THE OLD NEPTUNE INN._\r\n\r\n      \"Shall I not take mine ease in mine Inn.\"\r\n                            --_Shakespeare_.\r\n\r\n    \"The Golden Fleece was the oldest tavern in Corinth. It had been the\r\n    resort of sea-faring men from the remotest period.\"--(_Travels of\r\n    Herodotus in Greece_, 460 _B.C._)\r\n\r\n    When the brilliant Henry Ward Beecher pronounced Quebec an _Old\r\n    Curiosity Shop_, we are induced to think that amidst its accumulated\r\n    antiquarian relics, its church pictures and madonnas, its famous\r\n    battle-fields, its historical monuments, massive fortifications and\r\n    wondrous scenery,--more than one of the quaint French dwellings with\r\n    their peaked gables, and walls four feet thick, must have caught his\r\n    observant eye. However striking Ward Beecher's word-painting may be,\r\n    it would I opine, have required the marvellous pencil of the author of\r\n    \"_The House with the Seven Gables_,\" Nathaniel Hawthorne, becomingly\r\n    to portray all the _arcana_ of such a building as the _Chien d'Or_\r\n    (the old Post Office), with its ghastly memories of blood and revenge.\r\n\r\n    The legendary moss clustering round these hoary piles, is not,\r\n    however, always dark and gloomy. Love, war, adventure, occasionally\r\n    lend them their exciting or their soft glamour. Sometimes the annals\r\n    of commerce entwine them with a green wreath--a sure talisman against\r\n    the rust of oblivion. It is one of the land marks of commerce we\r\n    purpose here briefly to describe.\r\n\r\n    At the foot of Mountain Hill, lies our chief emporium of news,\r\n    labelled for more than a quarter of a century, _Morning Chronicle_\r\n    Office. These premises stand on a very conspicuous site, viz., at the\r\n    foot of Mountain Hill, the highway from the port to the Upper Town,\r\n    direct to the old _Château_ and Citadel--a few rods only from the spot\r\n    where Champlain, in 1608, laid the foundations of his extensive\r\n    warehouses and dwelling, and close to where, in 1615, he had his\r\n    famous gardens. This business stand, for many years past, was owned by\r\n    the late Hon. Henry Black; at present it belongs to Hon. Geo. Okill\r\n    Stuart, Judge of the Court of Vice Admiralty. Its beginnings brings us\r\n    back to the era of the Bourbon sovereigns of Canada, to the\r\n    unregretted time (1758), when Intendant Bigot's shoddy _entourage_\r\n    held high carnival in famine-stricken Quebec.\r\n\r\n    In those blighting days, in which Madame de Pompadour reigned in\r\n    France, and Madame Pean in Quebec, _rings_ and public robbery\r\n    flourished in Canada; but among high officials, all were not corrupt.\r\n    There were some memorable exceptions. One of these exceptions was the\r\n    worthy, witty, and honest warden of the Quebec merchants, Jean Taché,\r\n    \"_homme probe et d'esprit_,\" say old memoirs. Mr. Taché, the \"_syndic\r\n    des marchands_,\" was not only an upright and wealthy merchant, he was\r\n    also gifted with the poetical fire; he, it was, who wrote the first\r\n    French poem issued in Canada, \"_Le Tableau de la Mer_.\"\r\n\r\n    Jean Taché was also an extensive holder of real estate in and round\r\n    Quebec, warehouses (_des voûtes_) on the Napoleon wharf; a country\r\n    seat on the Ste. Foye road, subsequently the property of Surveyor-\r\n    General Samuel Holland--Holland Farm; lastly, the well-known business\r\n    stand, where, in 1847, Mr. St. Michel printed James Bell Forsyth's\r\n    news sheet, the _Morning Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n    Commercial ruin overtook the worthy Lower Town magnate, Monsieur\r\n    Taché; his ships and cargoes, during the war of the conquest, like the\r\n    rest of poor, deserted Canada, fell into English hands, being captured\r\n    at sea; out of the disaster Jean Taché saved naught but his honourable\r\n    name.\r\n\r\n    We fail to trace for a time the fortunes of his Mountain Hill Counting\r\n    House. At the dawn of this century the premises were used as a famous\r\n    coffee-house, the \"Neptune\" Inn, [91] a noted place of resort for\r\n    merchants, masters and owners of ships. Like the Golden Fleece Tavern\r\n    of Corinth, which seems to have sheltered the father of History--\r\n    Herodotus--in the year 460 B.C., its \"banqueting saloon\" was roomy,\r\n    though every word uttered there also smacked of the salt water. The\r\n    old \"Neptune\" was probably occasionally looked up in 1807 by the Press\r\n    Gang, which, in those days, was not a thing to be laughed at. Witness\r\n    the fate of poor Latresse, shot down for refusing to surrender to\r\n    Lieut. Andrel, R.N., on trying to make his escape from a tavern in St.\r\n    John's suburbs, where he had been attending a dancing party. [92]\r\n\r\n    Singularly enough, sixty years ago, the leading Lower Town merchants\r\n    met in this old tenement of the former \"_Syndic des Marchands_\"\r\n    to establish the first Exchange. Of the resolutions passed at the\r\n    meeting thereat, held in 1816, and presided over by an eminent\r\n    merchant, John William Woolsey, Esq., subsequently President of the\r\n    Quebec Bank, we find a notice in the _Quebec Gazette_, of 12th\r\n    December, 1816. [93] They decided to establish a Merchant's Exchange\r\n    in the lower part of the \"Neptune\" Inn. Amongst those present, one\r\n    recognizes familiar names--John Jones, George Symes, James Heath,\r\n    Robert Melvin, Thomas Edward Brown, &c.\r\n\r\n    Why was the place called \"Neptune\" Inn? For the obvious reason that a\r\n    large statue of the god of the sea, bearing in one hand a formidable\r\n    iron trident, stood over the main entrance in a threatening attitude.\r\n    This conspicuous land-mark was known to every British ship-captain\r\n    frequenting our port. Right well can the writer of these lines\r\n    remember the truculent trident.\r\n\r\n    But if, even in the days of that excellent landlady, Mrs. Hammond, it\r\n    meant to the wearied mariner boundless cheer, the latest London\r\n    papers, pipes and soothing rum punch mixed by a comely and cheerful\r\n    bar-maid, to the unsophisticated Canadian peasant, attracted to the\r\n    Lower Town on market days, it was of evil portent.\r\n\r\n    With honest Jean Baptiste, more deeply read in the _Petit Catéchisme_\r\n    than in heathen mythology, the dreaded god of the sea and his\r\n    truculent trident were ominous, in his simple eyes, they symbolised\r\n    the Prince of Darkness, \"_Le diable et sa fourche_,\" the terrors of a\r\n    hereafter.\r\n\r\n    This did not, however, prevent Neptune from standing sentry, in the\r\n    same exalted spot, for close on forty years, until in fact, having\r\n    fallen to pieces by natural decay, it was removed about the time the\r\n    Old Neptune Inn became the _Morning Chronicle_ office; the whereabouts\r\n    of its _dejecta membra_ are now a dead secret.\r\n\r\n    The origin of the famed statue had defied the most recondite searchers\r\n    of the past. For the following we are indebted to the retentive memory\r\n    of that eminently respected authority, the \"oldest inhabitant.\" The\r\n    statue of Neptune, says the octogenarian, Robert Urquhart, so well\r\n    remembered at the foot of Mountain Hill, was presented to the landlord\r\n    of the hotel, George Cossar, formerly butler to Hon. Matthew Bell, who\r\n    then owned the St. Lawrence Chambers. It had been the figure-head of\r\n    the _Neptune_, a large king's ship, stranded in 1817 on Anticosti.\r\n    Would the stranded _Neptune_ of 1817 be the same as the flagship of\r\n    Admiral Durell in 1759, the _Neptune_ of 90 guns, to whom the large\r\n    bell bearing the word \"_Neptune_, 1760,\" inscribed on, belonged? This\r\n    bell, which formerly stood on the Royal Engineers' workshop at Quebec,\r\n    was recently taken to Ottawa. The wreck had been bought by John\r\n    Goudie, of St. Roch suburb, then a leading ship builder, and, having\r\n    to break it up, the figure-head was brought to Quebec, and presented\r\n    as above stated.\r\n\r\n        The following respecting press gangs and the presence of Lord\r\n        Nelson, whilst at Quebec in 1782, was contributed by one of the\r\n        \"oldest inhabitants\" to QUEBEC PAST AND PRESENT, but reached too\r\n        late for insertion:--\r\n\r\n        _MY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE PAST._\r\n\r\n        J. M. LEMOINE, Esq., _Spencer Grange_.\r\n\r\n        DEAR SIR,--I have much pleasure in acceding to your request to\r\n        send you a note of some circumstances connected with the city, in\r\n        which seventy-one years of my life--now verging towards eighty--\r\n        have been spent. I am familiar with no part of Nelson's career,\r\n        except what I heard from my mother's own lips respecting this\r\n        brave man. My mother was gifted with a remarkable memory, and\r\n        recollected well having herself seen Captain Nelson, when in 1782,\r\n        he commanded at Quebec the sloop-of-war Albemarle. \"He was erect,\r\n        stern of aspect and wore, as was then customary, the _queue_\r\n        or pigtail,\" she often repeated. Her idea of the Quebec young lady\r\n        to whom he had taken such a violent fancy, was that her name was\r\n        Woolsey--an aunt or elder sister, perhaps, of the late John W.\r\n        Woolsey, Esq., President for some years of the Quebec Bank, who\r\n        died in 1852, at a very advanced age. According to her, it was a\r\n        Mr. Davidson who prevented the imprudent marriage contemplated.\r\n\r\n        As to the doings of the press gangs in the Lower Town and suburbs,\r\n        I can speak from what I saw more than once. Impressing seamen\r\n        lasted at Quebec from 1807, until after the battle of Waterloo.\r\n        The terror these sea-faring gentlemen created was great. I\r\n        remember a fine young fellow who refused to surrender, being shot\r\n        through the back with a holster pistol and dying of the wound,\r\n        this was in 1807. I can name the following as being seized by\r\n        press gangs * * * * * Soon ruses were resorted to by the gay\r\n        fellows who wandered after night fall in quest of amusement in the\r\n        highways and byways. Her Majesty's soldiers were, of course,\r\n        exempt of being impressed into the naval service; so, that our\r\n        roving city youths would either borrow coats, or get some made,\r\n        similar to the soldiers', to elude the press gang. These ruses\r\n        were, however, soon stopped, the press gang, having secured the\r\n        services of two city constables, Rosa and ------, who could spot\r\n        every city youth and point out the counterfeits.\r\n\r\n        R. URQUHART.\r\n\r\n        Quebec, 1st August, 1876.\r\n\r\nParallel with St. Peter street, runs Notre Dame street, which leads us to\r\nthe little Church of the Lower Town, named Notre Dame de la Victoire, in\r\nremembrance of the victory achieved in 1690 over Sir William Phipps. This\r\nchurch was, at a later period, called \"Notre Dame des Victoires,\" in\r\ncommemoration of the dispersion by a storm of Admiral Walker's squadron,\r\nin 1711. Bishop Laval had projected the erection of this modest little\r\nchurch, but the building of it was performed in 1688, under the auspices\r\nof his successor, Bishop St. Vallier, out of funds provided by the Lower\r\nTown ladies. The corner of these streets (St. Peter and Sous-le-Fort\r\nstreets) is probably the site of the \"Abitation,\" close to the walks and\r\ngarden plots where Champlain cultivated roses and carnations, about the\r\nyear 1615.\r\n\r\nFronting the Church of \"Notre Dame des Victoires,\" and on the site now\r\noccupied as Blanchard's Hotel, the ladies of the Ursulines, in 1639, found\r\na refuge in a humble residence, a sort of shop or store, owned at that\r\nperiod by the Sieur Juchereau des Châtelets, at the foot of the path\r\n(_sentier_), leading up to the mountain (foot of Mountain street), and\r\nwhere the then Governor, M. de Montmagny, as is related, sent them their\r\nfirst Quebec meal.\r\n\r\nThe locality possesses other pleasant memories: the good, the youthful,\r\nthe beautiful Madame de Champlain, about the year 1620, here catechised\r\nand instructed, under the shade of the trees, the young Huron Indians, in\r\nthe principles of Christianity. History has related their surprise and joy\r\non seeing their features reflected in the small mirror which their\r\nbenefactress wore suspended at her side, \"close to her heart,\" as they\r\nsaid, according to the then prevailing custom.\r\n\r\nIn 1682 a conflagration broke out in the Lower Town, which, besides the\r\nnumerous vaults and stores, reduced into ashes a considerable portion of\r\nthe buildings. Denonville, on the 20th August, 1685, wrote to Paris,\r\nasking His Most Christian Majesty to contribute 200 crowns worth of\r\nleather fire-buckets, and in 1691 the historical Dutch pump was imported\r\nto throw water on fires. At a later period, 1688, \"Notre Dame de la\r\nVictoire\" Church was begun on part of the ruins. Let us open the second\r\nvolume of the \"_Cours d'Histoire du Canada_,\" by the Abbé Ferland, and let\r\nus read: \"Other ruins existed in 1684, in the commercial centre of the\r\nLower Town; these ruins consisted of blackened and dilapidated walls.\r\nChamplain's old warehouse, which, from the hands of the Company\r\n(_Compagnie de la Nouvelle France_), had passed into those of the\r\nKing (Louis XIV.), had remained in the same state as when left after the\r\ngreat fire which, some years previously, had devastated the Lower Town.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1684 Monseigneur de Laval obtained this site or _emplacement_ from\r\nM. de la Barre for the purpose of erecting a supplementary chapel for the\r\nuse of the inhabitants in the Lower Town. This gift, however, was ratified\r\nonly later, in favor of M. de St. Valier, in the month of September, 1685.\r\nMessieurs de Denonville and de Meules caused a clear and plain title or\r\npatent of this locality to be issued for the purpose of erecting a church\r\nwhich, in the course of time, was built by the worthy Bishop and named\r\n\"Notre Dame de la Victoire.\" The landing for small craft, in the vicinity\r\nof the old market (now the Finlay [94] Market), was called \"La Place du\r\nDébarquement,\" or simply \"La Place.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in this vicinity, a little to the west, under the silent shade of a\r\nwood near the garden which Champlain had laid out, that the historical\r\ninterview, in 1608, which saved the colony, took place. The secret was of\r\nthe greatest importance; it is not to be wondered at if Champlain's trusty\r\npilot, Captain Testu, deemed it proper to draw the founder of Quebec aside\r\ninto the neighbouring wood and make known to him the villanous plot which\r\none of the accomplices, Antoine Natel, lock-smith, had first disclosed to\r\nhim under the greatest secrecy. The chief of the conspiracy was one Jean\r\ndu Val, who had come to the country with Champlain.\r\n\r\nIn rear of and parallel to St. Peter street, a new and wide street, called\r\nafter one of the Governors of Canada--Dalhousie street--was opened\r\nrecently, and promises to be before long the leading commercial artery.\r\nSeveral extensive warehouses have been erected on Dalhousie street since\r\nit was opened to the public, in 1877, by the city Corporation purchasing\r\nfrom St. James street to St. Andrew's wharf a strip of land, of 60 feet in\r\nbreadth, from the landed proprietors of this neighbourhood. At the south-\r\nwestern extremity a noble dry goods store has just been erected by Mr.\r\nGeorge Alford; it is four stories high, 155 feet long and 72 feet wide,\r\nand faces on Dalhousie, Laporte, Union Lane and Finlay Market. It is\r\noccupied by a wealthy and ancient dry goods firm, founded in Montreal\r\nabout 1810, with a branch in Quebec, in 1825. The original founders were\r\nMessrs. Robertson, Masson & Larocque; this firm was subsequently changed\r\nto Robertson, Masson, Strang & Co., to Masson, Bruyère, Thibaudeau & Co.,\r\nto Langevin, Thibaudeau, Bruyère & Co., to Thibaudeau, Thomas & Co., to\r\nThibaudeau, Généreux & Co., and finally to Thibaudeau Frères & Co., at\r\nQuebec; Thibaudeau Bros. & Co., Montreal; Thibaudeau Bros. & Co., London,\r\nManchester and Manitoba.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the colony, the diminutive market space, facing the\r\nfront of Notre Dame Church, Lower Town, as well as the Upper Town Market,\r\nwas used for the infliction of corporal punishment, or the pillory, or the\r\nexecution of culprits.\r\n\r\nOn the area facing the Lower Town Church on Notre Dame street, the plan of\r\nthe city, drawn by the engineer, Jean François or Jehan Bourdon, in 1641,\r\nshows a bust of Louis XIII., long since removed; this market, which dates\r\nfrom the earliest times of the colony, as well as the vacant area (until\r\nrecently the Upper Town market, facing the Basilica), was used as a place\r\nfor corporal punishment, and for the exhibition in the pillory of public\r\nmalefactors.\r\n\r\n\"Among the incidents,\" says Mr. T. P. Bédard, \"which claimed the privilege\r\nof exciting the curiosity of the good folks of Quebec (then 1680,\r\ninhabited by 1,345 souls,) was reckoned the case of Jean Rathier, charged\r\nwith murdering a girl of eighteen--Jeanne Couc. The case had been tried at\r\nThree Rivers, and Rathier sentenced to have his legs broken [95] with an\r\niron bar, and afterwards to be hung. Judgment had been confirmed. An\r\nunforseen hitch arose: the official hangman was dead; how then was Rathier\r\nto be hung? The officers of justice cut the Gordian knot, by tendering to\r\nRathier, in lieu of the halter, the position, little envied, of hangman.\r\nHe accepted. Some years after, the wife and the daughter of Rathier were\r\naccused and found guilty as accomplices in a robbery; the daughter, as the\r\nreceiver of the stolen goods, was sentenced to be whipped, but in secret,\r\nat the General Hospital by the nun appointed Provost Marshal (_Maitress\r\nde Discipline_), and the mother was also adjudged to be whipped, but\r\npublicly in the streets of the city. This incident furnished the singular\r\nand ludicrous spectacle of a husband publicly whipping his wife with\r\nimpunity to himself, as he was acting under the authority of justice.\"--\r\n(_Première Administration de Frontenac_, _p._ 39.)\r\n\r\nThe whip and pillory did not go out with the old _régime_. The _Quebec\r\nGazette_ of 19th June, 1766, mentions the whipping, on the Upper and Lower\r\nTown markets, of Catherine Berthrand and Jeanotte Blaize, by the hand of\r\nthe executioneer, for having \"borrowed\" (a pretty way of describing petty\r\nlarceny), a silver spoon from a gentleman of the town, without leave or\r\nwithout intention of returning it.\r\n\r\nFor male reprobates, such as Jean May and Louis Bruseau, whose punishment\r\nfor petty larceny is noted in the Gazette of 11th August, 1766, the\r\nwhipping was supplemented with a walk--tied at the cart's tail--from the\r\nCourt House door to St. Roch and back to the Court House. May had to whip\r\nBruseau and Bruseau had to whip May the day following, at ten in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nLet us revert to Captain Testu's doings. The plot was to strangle\r\nChamplain, pillage the warehouse, and afterwards betake themselves to the\r\nSpanish and Basque vessels, laying at Tadousac. As, at that period, no\r\nCourt of Appeals existed in \"_la Nouvelle France_\"--far less was a\r\n\"Supreme Court\" thought of--the trial of the chief of the conspiracy was\r\nsoon dispatched says Champlain, and the Sieur Jean du Val was \"_presto_\r\nwell and duly hanged and strangled at Quebec aforesaid, and his head\r\naffixed to the top of a pike-staff planted on the highest eminence of the\r\nFort.\" The ghastly head of this traitor, on the end of a pike-staff, near\r\nNotre Dame street, must certainly have had a sinister effect at twilight.\r\n\r\nBut the brave Captain Testu, the saviour of Champlain and of Quebec--what\r\nbecame of him? Champlain has done him the honour of naming him; here the\r\nmatter ended. Neither monument, nor poem, nor page of history in his\r\nhonour; nothing was done in the way of commemorating his devotion. As in\r\nthe instance of the illustrious man, whose life he had saved, his grave is\r\nunknown. According to the Abbé Tanguay, none of his posterity exist at\r\nthis day.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of 1759, we notice in _Panet's Journal_, \"that the Lower\r\nTown was a complete mass of smoking ruins; on the 8th August, it was\r\na burning heap (_braisier_). Wolfe and Saunders' bombshells had found\r\ntheir way even to the under-ground vaults. This epoch became disastrous to\r\nmany Quebecers.\" The English threw bombs (_pots à feu_) on the Lower\r\nTown, of which, says Mr. Panet, \"one fell on my house, one on the houses\r\nin the Market place, and the last in Champlain street. The fire burst out\r\nsimultaneously, in three different directions; it was in vain to attempt\r\nto cut off or extinguish the fire at my residence; a gale was blowing from\r\nthe north-east, and the Lower Town was soon nothing less than a blazing\r\nmass. Beginning at my house, that of M. Desery, that of M. Maillou, Sault-\r\nau-Matelot street, the whole of the Lower Town and all the quarter _Cul-\r\nde-Sac_ up to the property of Sieur Voyer, which was spared, and in\r\nshort up to the house of the said Voyer, the whole was devastated by fire.\r\nSeven vaults [96] had been rent to pieces or burned: that of M. Perrault\r\nthe younger, that of M. Taché, of M. Benjamin de la Mordic, of Jehaune, of\r\nMaranda. You may judge of the consternation which reigned; 167 houses had\r\nbeen burnt.\"\r\n\r\nOne hundred and sixty-seven burnt houses would create many gaps. We know\r\nthe locality on which stood the warehouse of M. Perrault, junior, also\r\nthat of M. Taché (the _Chronicle Bureau_), but who can point out to\r\nus where stood the houses of Desery, Maillou, Voyer, de Voisy, and the\r\nvaults of Messieurs Benjamin de la Mordic, Jehaune, Maranda?\r\n\r\nIt is on record that Champlain, after his return to Quebec, in 1633, \"had\r\ntaken care to refit a battery which he had planted on a level with the\r\nriver near the warehouse, the guns of which commanded the passage between\r\nQuebec and the opposite shore.\" [97] Now, in 1683, \"this cannon battery,\r\nerected in the Lower Town, almost surrounded on all sides by houses, stood\r\nat some distance from the edge of the river, and caused some inconvenience\r\nto the public; the then Governor, Lefebvre de la Barre [98] having sought\r\nout a much more advantageous locality towards the Point of Rocks (_Pointe\r\ndes Roches_) west of the _Cul-de-Sac_, [99] and on the margin of the said\r\nriver at high-water mark, which would more efficiently command and sweep\r\nthe harbour, and which would cause far less inconvenience to the houses in\r\nthe said Lower Town,\" considered it fit to remove the said battery, and\r\nthe Reverend Jesuit Fathers having proposed to contribute towards the\r\nexpenses which would be incurred in so doing, he made them a grant \"of a\r\nportion of the lot of ground (_emplacement_) situated in front of the site\r\non which is now planted the said cannon battery, * * * * between the\r\nstreet or high road for wheeled vehicles coming from the harbour [100] and\r\nthe so-called St. Peter street.\"\r\n\r\nHere then we have the origin of the Napoleon wharf and a very distinct\r\nmention of St. Peter street. The building erected near this site was sold\r\non the 22nd October, 1763, to William Grant, Esquire, who, on the 19th\r\nDecember, 1763, also purchased the remainder of the ground down to low-\r\nwater mark, from Thomas Mills, Esquire, Town Major, who had shortly before\r\nobtained a grant or patent of it, the 7th December, 1763, from Governor\r\nMurray, in recognition, as is stated in the preamble of the patent, of his\r\nmilitary services. This property which, at a later period, belonged to the\r\nlate William Burns, was by him conveyed, the 16th October, 1806, to the\r\nlate J. M. Woolsey. The Napoleon wharf, purchased in 1842 by the late\r\nJulien Chouinard from the late Frs. Buteau, forms at present part of the\r\nEstate Chouinard; in reality, it is composed of two wharves joined into\r\none; the western portion is named \"The Queen's Wharf,\" and was Mr.\r\nWoolsey's property.\r\n\r\nThe highway which leads from the Cape towards this wharf is named \"Sous-\r\nle-Fort\" street, which sufficiently denotes its position; this street, the\r\noldest, probably dates from the year 1620, when the foundations of Fort\r\nSt. Louis were laid; we may presume that, in 1663, the street terminated\r\nat \"la Pointe des Roches.\" In the last century \"Sous-le-Fort\" street was\r\ngraced by the residences, among others, of Fleury de la Jannière, brother\r\nof Fleury de la Gorgendière, brother-in-law of the Governor de Vaudreuil.\r\n\r\nIn this street also stood the house of M. George Allsop, [101] the head of\r\nthe opposition in Governor Cramahé's Council. His neighbour was M.\r\nd'Amours des Plaines, Councillor of the Superior Council; further on,\r\nstood the residence of M. Cuvillier, the father of the Honorable Austin\r\nCuvillier, in 1844 Speaker of the House of Assembly. In this street also\r\nexisted the warehouse of M. Cugnet, the lessee of the Domaine of Labrador.\r\n\r\nWe must not confound the Napoleon wharf, sold by J. O. Brunet to Francois\r\nButeau, with the Queen's wharf, the property of the late J. W. Woolsey. On\r\nthe Queen's wharf, in a dwelling, since converted into a tavern, in 1846\r\none of the wittiest members of the Quebec Bar, Auguste Soulard, Esq.,\r\nopened a law office for the especial convenience of his numerous country\r\nclients. After office hours it was the rendezvous of many young\r\nbarristers, who have since made their mark: Messieurs T. Fournier, Justice\r\nof the Supreme Court; A. Plamondon, Judge of the Superior Court; N.\r\nCasault, Judge of the Superior Court; Jean Taché, Frederick Braun, L.\r\nFiset, J. M. Hudon and others. From the king's wharf to the king's forges\r\n(the ruins of which were discovered at the beginning of the century, a\r\nlittle further up than the king's store), there are but a few steps.\r\n\r\nFrançois Bellet, M.P. for the county of Buckingham from 1815 to 1820,\r\nresided on the property of the late Julien Chouinard, at the corner of St.\r\nPeter and Sous-le-Fort streets. He combined parliamentary duties, it\r\nseems, with a sea-faring life, being styled \"Capitaine de Bâtiment\" in a\r\npower of attorney before Martin A. Dumas, N.P., at Quebec, dated 9th\r\nSeptember, 1796, in which as attorney and agent for Revd. \"Messire Louis\r\nPayet, prêtre, curé de la paroisse de St. Antoine, au Nord de la Rivière\r\nRichelieu,\" he sells to Monsieur Thomas Lee, later on an M.P.P., his negro\r\nslave, named Rose, for the sum of \"500 livres et vingt sols,\"--about $100\r\nof our currency. The traffic in human flesh became extinct in Canada in\r\n1803 by legislative enactment. The bluest blood of our Southern neighbours\r\nwas shed to keep it up in the model Republic sixty years subsequently.\r\n[102] In the space between the Queen's wharf and the jetty on the west,\r\nbelonging to the Imperial authorities and called the king's wharf, there\r\nexisted a bay or landing place, much prized by our ancestors, which\r\nafforded a harbour for the coasting vessels and small river crafts, called\r\nthe \"_Cul-de-Sac_.\" There, also, the ships which were overtaken by an\r\nearly winter lingered until the sunny days of April released them from\r\ntheir icy fetters. There the ships were put into winter quarters, and\r\nsecurely bedded on a foundation or bed of clay; wrecked vessels also came\r\nhither to undergo repairs. The _Cul-de-Sac_, with its uses and marine\r\ntraditions, had, in by-gone days, an important function in our\r\nincomparable sea-port. In this vicinity, Vaudreuil, in 1759, planted a\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\nThe old Custom House (now the Department of Marine), was built on this\r\nsite in 1833. In 1815 the Custom House was on McCallum's wharf. The\r\n_Cul-de-Sac_ recalls \"the first chapel which served as a Parish\r\nChurch at Quebec,\" that which Champlain caused to be built in the Lower\r\nTown in 1615, where the name of Champlain is identified with the street\r\nwhich was bounded by this chapel. The Revd. Fathers Récollets there\r\nperformed their clerical functions up to the period of the taking of\r\nQuebec by the brothers Kertk, that is from 1615 to 1629, (Laverdière.)\r\n\r\nNothing less than the urgent necessity of providing the public with a\r\nconvenient market-place, and the small coasting steamers with suitable\r\nwharves, could move the municipal authorities to construct the wharves now\r\nexisting, and there, in 1856, to erect out of the materials of the old\r\nParliament House, the spacious Champlain Hall, so conspicuous at present.\r\nThe king's wharf and the king's stores, two hundred and fifty feet in\r\nlength, with a guard house, built on the same site in 1821, possess also\r\ntheir marine and military traditions. The \"Queen's Own\" volunteers, Capt.\r\nRayside, were quartered there during the stirring times of 1837-38, when\r\n\"Bob Symes\" dreamed each night of a new conspiracy against the British\r\ncrown, and M. Aubin perpetuated, in his famous journal \"_Le Fantasque_\"\r\nthe memory of this loyal magistrate.\r\n\r\nHow many saucy frigates, how many proud English Admirals, have made fast\r\ntheir boats at the steps of this wharf! Jacques Cartier, Champlain,\r\nNelson, Bourgainville, Cook, Vauclain, Montgomery, Boxer, Sir Rodney\r\nMundy, poor Captain Burgoyne, of the ill-fated iron-clad _Captain_,\r\nSir Leopold McClintock, [103] have, one after the other, trodden over this\r\npicturesque landing place, commanded as it is by the guns of Cape Diamond.\r\nSince about a century, the street which bears the venerated name of the\r\nfounder of Quebec, Champlain street, unmindful of its ancient Gallic\r\ntraditions, is almost exclusively the headquarters of our Hibernian\r\npopulation. An ominous-looking black-board, affixed to one of the\r\nprojecting rocks of the Cape, indicates the spot below where one of their\r\ncountrymen, Brigadier-General Richard Montgomery, with his two _aides-\r\nde-camp_, Cheeseman and McPherson, received their death wounds during a\r\nviolent snow storm about five o'clock in the morning, the 31st December,\r\n1775. On this disastrous morning the post was guarded by Canadian\r\nmilitiamen, Messieurs Chabot and Picard. Captain Barnesfare, an English\r\nmariner, had pointed the cannon; Coffin and Sergeant Hugh McQuarters\r\napplied the match. At the eastern extremity, under the stairs, now styled\r\n\"Breakneck Steps,\" according to Messrs. Casgrain and Laverdière, was\r\ndiscovered Champlain's tomb, though a rival antiquary, M. S. Drapeau, says\r\nthat he is not certain of this. [104]\r\n\r\nA little to the west is Cap Blanc, inhabited by a small knot of French-\r\nCanadians and some Irish; near by, was launched in October, 1750, the\r\n_Orignal_, a King's ship, built at Quebec; at that period the lily flag of\r\nFrance floated over the bastions of Cape Diamond; the _Orignal_, in being\r\nlaunched, broke her back and sank. Among the notabilities of Cap Blanc,\r\none is bound to recall the athletic stevedore and pugilist, Jacques\r\nEtienne Blais. Should the fearless man's record not reach remote\r\nposterity, pointing him out as the Tom Sayers of Cap Blanc, it cannot fail\r\nto be handed down as the benefactor of the handsome new church of Notre\r\nDame de la Garde, erected on the shore in 1878, the site of which was\r\nmunificently given by him on the 17th June, 1877. Jacques Blais, now\r\n(1881) very aged, though still vigorous, in his best days by his prowess\r\nre-called that prince of Quebec raftsmen so graphically delineated by Chas\r\nLanman.\r\n\r\nChamplain street stretches nearly to Cap Rouge, a distance of six miles.\r\nDuring the winter the fall of an avalanche from the brow of the Cape on\r\nthe houses beneath is a not unfrequent occurrence. In former years, in the\r\ngood time of ship-building, the laying the keel of a large vessel in the\r\nship-yards often brought joy to the hearts of the poor ship-carpenters;\r\nmany of whose white, snug cottages are grouped along the river near by.\r\n\r\nExcept during the summer months, when the crews of the ships, taking in\r\ncargo alongside the booms, sing, fight and dance in the adjacent\r\n\"shebeens,\" the year glides on peacefully. On grand, on gala days, in\r\nelection times, some of the sons of St. Patrick used to perambulate the\r\nhistorical street, flourishing treenails, or _shillaleghs_--in order\r\nto _preserve the peace!!!_ of course. To sum up all, Champlain street\r\nhas an aspect altogether _sui generis_.\r\n\r\n    A QUEBEC PORTRAIT\r\n\r\n    (From the ATLANTIC MONTHLY.)\r\n\r\n    \"Physical size and grand proportions are looked upon by the French-\r\n    Canadians with great respect. In all the cases of popular\r\n    _émeutes_ that have from time to time broken out in Lower Canada,\r\n    the fighting leaders of the people were exceptional men, standing head\r\n    and shoulders over their confiding followers. Where gangs of raftsmen\r\n    congregate, their 'captains' may be known by superior stature. The\r\n    doings of their 'big men' are treasured by the French-Canadians in\r\n    traditionary lore. One famous fellow of this governing class is known\r\n    by his deeds and words to every lumberer and stevedore and timber-\r\n    tower about Montreal and Quebec. This man, whose name was Joe\r\n    Monfaron, was the bully of the Ottawa raftsmen. He was about six feet\r\n    six inches high, and proportionally broad and deep; and I remember how\r\n    people would turn round to look after him, as he came pounding along\r\n    Notre Dame street, in Montreal, in his red shirt and tan-colored\r\n    _shupac_ boots, all dripping wet, after mooring an acre or two of\r\n    raft, and now bent for his ashore haunts in the Ste. Marie suburb, to\r\n    indemnify himself with bacchanalian and other consolations for long-\r\n    endured hardship. Among other feats of strength attributed to him, I\r\n    remember the following, which has an old, familiar taste, but was\r\n    related to me as a fact:\r\n\r\n    \"There was a fighting stevedore or timber-tower, I forget which, at\r\n    Quebec, who had never seen Joe Monfaron, as the latter seldom came\r\n    farther down the river than Montreal. This fighting character,\r\n    however, made a custom of laughing to scorn all the rumors that came\r\n    down on rafts, every now and then, about terrible chastisements\r\n    inflicted by Joe upon several hostile persons at once. He, the\r\n    fighting timber-tower, hadn't found his match yet about the lumber\r\n    coves at Quebec, and he only wanted to see Joe Monfaron once, when he\r\n    would settle the question as to the championship of rafts, on sight.\r\n    One day a giant in a red shirt stood suddenly before him, saying--\r\n\r\n    \"'You're Dick Dempsey, eh?'\r\n\r\n    \"'That's me.' replied the timber-tower, 'and who are you?'\r\n\r\n    \"'Joe Monfaron. I heard you wanted me--here I am,' was the Caesarean\r\n    answer of the great captain of rafts.\r\n\r\n    \"'Ah! you're Joe Monfaron!\" said the bully, a little staggered at the\r\n    sort of customer he saw before him. 'I said I'd like to see you, for\r\n    sure, but how am I to know you're the right man?'\r\n\r\n    \"'Shake hands first,' replied Joe, 'and then you will find out, may\r\n    be.'\r\n\r\n    \"They shook hands--rather warmly, perhaps, for the timber-tower, whose\r\n    features wore an uncertain expression during the operation, and who at\r\n    last broke out into a yell of pain, as Joe cast him off with a defiant\r\n    laugh. Nor did the bully wait for any further explanations, for,\r\n    whether the man who had just brought the blood spouting out at the\r\n    tops of his fingers was Joe Monfaron or not, he was clearly an ugly\r\n    customer, and had better be left alone.\r\n\r\nThe St. Lawrence, its rafts of timber, raftsmen, _voyageurs_ and\r\ntheir songs, are pleasantly alluded to by a sympathetic French writer of\r\nnote, X. Marmier, [105] who visited Canada some thirty years ago:\r\n\r\n    \"On the St. Lawrence, traversed by steamboats, by vessels heavily\r\n    laden, and by light bark canoes, we may see early in the season\r\n    immense rafts of timber that are brought down from the dense northern\r\n    forests, hewn where they are felled, drawn to the rivers upon the\r\n    snow, and made up into rafts. The Canadian crews erect masts and\r\n    spread their sails, and by the aid of wind and current, and sometimes\r\n    by rowing, they boldly guide these acres of fir down the rapids to\r\n    Quebec, while they animate their labours with the melody of their\r\n    popular songs. A part would intone the Canadian song\r\n\r\n      \"A la Claire Fontaine,\"\r\n\r\n    while the others, repeating the last two lines, would at the same time\r\n    let drop their oars as those of the former arose.\r\n\r\n    \"There is probably no river on earth that has heard so many vows of\r\n    love as the St. Lawrence; for there is not a Canadian boatman that has\r\n    ever passed up or down the river without repeating, as the blade of\r\n    his oar dropped into the stream, and as it arose, the national\r\n    refrain.\r\n\r\n      \"Il y a longtemps que je t'aime,\r\n      Jamais je ne t'oublierai!\"\r\n\r\n      \"Long time have I loved thee,\r\n      Never will I forget thee!\"\r\n\r\n    \"And I will here say that there is a harmonious sweetness in these\r\n    simple words, that well accords with the simple yet imposing character\r\n    of the scenery of this charming region.\r\n\r\n    \"Upon our coquettish rivers in Europe they may whisper of loves along\r\n    their flowery banks and under the vine-clad terraces that overhang\r\n    them, like the curtains of a saloon; but here, in this grand severity\r\n    of nature, upon these immense, half desert plains, in the silence of\r\n    these gloomy forests, on the banks of this majestic river that is ever\r\n    speeding onward to the eternal ocean, we may feel emotions that are\r\n    truly sublime. If, in this quiet solitude, should we open the soul to\r\n    a dream of love, it takes the serious tone; it needs must be a pure\r\n    being that dares to breathe to the heavens and to the waves these\r\n    sacred words, 'I love thee,' and that can add the promise and the\r\n    pledge of the Canadian song:\r\n\r\n      \"Jamais je ne t'oublierai.\"\r\n      \"Ne'er will I forget thee!\" [106]\r\n\r\nAmong the streets of Quebec, most celebrated in our annals by reason of\r\nthe incidents which attach thereto, one may name the frowsy and tortuous\r\nhighway which circulates from the foot of Mountain Hill, running for a\r\ndistance of two hundred feet below the Cape, up to the still narrower\r\npathway which commences west of St. James street and leads to the foot of\r\nthe hill \"_de la canoterie_;\" [107] all will understand we mean the\r\nleading commercial thoroughfare of olden time, [108] Sault-au-Matelot\r\nstreet. Is it because a sailor, no doubt only partially relieved from the\r\nhorrors of sobriety, there made a wild leap? or are we to attribute the\r\nname to the circumstance of a dog named \"Matelot\" (\"Sailor\") there taking\r\na leap? [109] Consult _Du Creux_. Our friend, Joseph Marmette,\r\nappropriated it for the reception of his hero, \"Dent de Loup,\" who escaped\r\nwithout broken bones after his leap. [110]\r\n\r\nThe western portion of the still narrower pathway of which we have just\r\nspoken, rejoices in the name of \"Ruelle des Chiens,\" (Dog Lane); [111] the\r\ndirectories name it Sous-le-Cap street. It is so narrow that, at certain\r\nangles, two carts passing in opposite directions, would be blocked. Just\r\npicture to yourself that up to the period of 1816, our worthy ancestors\r\nhad no other outlet in this direction at high water to reach St. Roch,\r\n(for St. Paul street was constructed subsequently to 1816, as M. de Gaspé\r\nhas informed us.) Is it not incredible? As, in certain passes of the Alps,\r\na watchman no doubt stood at either extremity of this lane, provided with\r\na speaking trumpet to give notice of any obstruction and thus prevent\r\ncollisions. This odoriferous locality, especially during the dog-days, is\r\nrather densely populated. The babes of Green Erin, with a sprinkling of\r\nyoung Jean Baptistes, here flourish like rabbits in a warren. Miss Kitty\r\nEllison and her friend. Mr. Arbuton, in their romantic wanderings, were\r\nstruck with the _mise en scène_ of Dog Lane:--\r\n\r\n    \"Now that Prescott Gate, by which so many thousands of Americans have\r\n    entered Quebec since Arnold's excursionists failed to do so, is\r\n    demolished, there is nothing left so picturesque and characteristic as\r\n    Hope Gate (alas! since razed), and I doubt if anywhere in Europe there\r\n    is a more mediaeval-looking bit of military architecture. The heavy\r\n    stone gateway is black with age, and the gate, which has probably\r\n    never been closed in our century, is of massive frame, set thick with\r\n    mighty bolts and spikes. The wall here sweeps along the brow of the\r\n    crag on which the city is built, and a steep street drops down, by\r\n    stone-parapeted curves and angles, from the Upper to the Lower Town,\r\n    when, in 1775, nothing but a narrow lane bordered the St. Lawrence. A\r\n    considerable breadth of land has since been won from the river, and\r\n    several streets and many piers now stretch between this alley and the\r\n    water, but the old Sault-au-Matelot still crouches and creeps along\r\n    under the shelter of the city wall and the overhanging rock, which is\r\n    thickly bearded with weeds and grass, and trickles with abundant\r\n    moisture. It must be an ice pit in winter, and I should think it the\r\n    last spot on the continent for the summer to find; but when the summer\r\n    has at last found it, the old Sault-au-Matelot puts on a vagabond air\r\n    of southern leisure and abandon, not to be matched anywhere out of\r\n    Italy. Looking from that jutting rock near Hope Gate, behind which the\r\n    defeated Americans took refuge from the fire of their enemies, the\r\n    vista is almost unique for a certain scenic squalor and gypsy luxury\r\n    of colour--sag-roofed barns and stables, and weak-backed, sunken-\r\n    chested workshops of every sort, lounge along in tumble-down\r\n    succession, and lean up against the cliff in every imaginable posture\r\n    of worthlessness and decrepitude, light wooden galleries cross to them\r\n    from the second stories of the houses which back upon the alley, and\r\n    over these galleries flutters from a labyrinth of clothes-lines a\r\n    variety of bright-coloured garments of all ages, sexes and conditions,\r\n    while the footway underneath abounds in gossiping women, smoking men,\r\n    idle poultry, cats, children, and large, indolent Newfoundland dogs.\"\r\n    --(_A Chance Acquaintance_, p, 175.)\r\n\r\nAdventurous tourists who have risked themselves there in the sultry days\r\nof July, have found themselves dazed at the sight of the wonders of the\r\nplace. Among other indigenous curiosities, they have there noticed what\r\nmight be taken for any number of aerial tents, improvised no doubt as\r\nprotection from the scorching rays of a meridian sun. Attached to ropes\r\nstretched from one side of the public way to the other, was the family\r\nlinen, hung out to dry. When shaken by the wind over the heads of the\r\npassers-by, these articles of white under-clothing (_chemisettes_),\r\nflanked by sundry masculine nether-garments, presented a _tableau_,\r\nit is said, in the highest degree picturesque. As regards ourselves,\r\ndesirous from our earliest days to search into the most recondite\r\n_arcana_ of the history of our city and to portray them in all their\r\nsuggestive reality, for the edification of distinguished tourists from\r\nEngland, France and the United States, it has been to us a source of\r\ninfinite mortification to realize that the only visit which we ever made\r\nto Dog Lane was subsequent to the publication of the _Album du Touriste_;\r\na circumstance which explains the omission of it from that repository of\r\nCanadian lore. Our most illustrious tourists, [112] the eldest son of the\r\nQueen, the Prince of Wales, his brothers, the Princes Alfred and Arthur,\r\nthe Dukes of Newcastle, of Athol, of Manchester, of Beaufort, of Argyle,\r\nof Sutherland, Generals Grant and Sherman, and Prince Napoleon Bonaparte,\r\nit is said, took their leave of Quebec without having visited that\r\ninteresting locality, \"_la Ruelle des Chiens_,\" Sous-le-Cap street,\r\nprobably unconscious of its very existence! Nevertheless, this street\r\npossesses great historical interest. It has re-echoed the trumpet sounds\r\nof war, the thundering of cannon, the briskest musketry; there fell\r\nBrigadier-General Arnold, wounded in the knee: carried off amid the\r\ndespairing cries of his soldiers, under the swords of Dambourgès, of the\r\nfierce and stalwart Charland, of the brave Caldwell, followed by his\r\nfriend Nairn and their chivalrous militiamen. Our friends, the\r\nannexationists of that period, were so determined to annex Quebec, that\r\nthey threw themselves as if possessed by the evil one upon the barriers\r\n(there were two of them) in Sous-le-Cap street and in Sault-au-Matelot\r\nstreet; each man, says Sanguinet, wearing a slip of paper on his cap on\r\nwhich was written \"_Mors aut Victoria_,\" \"Death or Victory!\" One\r\nhundred years and more have elapsed since this fierce struggle, and we are\r\nnot yet under Republican rule!\r\n\r\nA number of dead bodies lay in the vicinity, on the 31st December, 1775;\r\nthey were carried to the Seminary. Ample details of the incidents of this\r\nglorious day will be found in \"QUEBEC PAST AND PRESENT.\" It is believed\r\nthat the first barrier was placed at the foot of the stone _demi-lune_,\r\nwhere, at present, a cannon rests on the ramparts; the second was\r\nconstructed in rear of the present offices of Mr. W. D. Campbell, N.P., in\r\nSault-au-Matelot street.\r\n\r\nSault-au-Matelot street has lost the military renown which it then\r\npossessed; besides the offices of M. Ledroit, of the _Morning Chronicle_,\r\nand of the timber cullers, it now is a stand for the carters, and a\r\nnumerous tribe of pork merchants, salmon preservers and coopers, whose\r\ncasks on certain days encumber the sidewalks.\r\n\r\nSt. Paul street does not appear on the plan of the city of Quebec of 1660,\r\nreproduced by the Abbé Faillon. This quarter of the Lower Town, so\r\npopulous under the French _régime, and where, according to Monseigneur de\r\nLaval, there was, in 1661, \"_magnus numerus civium_\" continued, until\r\nabout 1832, to represent the hurry-scurry of affairs and the residences of\r\nthe principal merchants, one of the wealthiest portions of the city.\r\nThere, in 1793, the father of our Queen, Colonel of the 7th Fusiliers,\r\nthen in garrison at Quebec, partook of the hospitality of M. Lymburner,\r\none of the merchant princes of that period. Was the _chère amie_, the\r\nelegant _Baronne de St. Laurent_, of the party? We found it impossible to\r\nascertain this from our old friend, Hon. William Sheppard, of Woodfield,\r\nnear Quebec (who died in 1867), from whom we obtained this incident. Mr.\r\nSheppard, who had frequently been a guest at the most select drawing-rooms\r\nof the ancient capital, was himself a contemporary of the generous and\r\njovial Prince Edward.\r\n\r\nThe Sault-au-Matelot quarter, St. Peter street, and St. James street, down\r\nto the year 1832, contained the habitations of a great number of persons\r\nin easy circumstances; many of our families of note had their residences\r\nthere: John Wm. Woolsey, Esq., in 1808, and later on first President of\r\nthe Quebec Bank; the millionaire auctioneer, Wm. Burns, the god-father to\r\nthe late George Burns Symes, Esq.; Archbishop Signai--this worthy prelate\r\nwas born in this street, in a house opposite to La Banque Nationale.\r\nEvidences of the luxuriousness of their dwelling rooms are visible to this\r\nday, in the panelling of some doors and in decorated ceilings.\r\n\r\nDrainage, according to the modern system, was, at that period, almost\r\nunknown to our good city. The Asiatic cholera, in 1832, decimated the\r\npopulation: 3,500 corpses, in the course of a few weeks, had gone to their\r\nlast resting place. This terrible epidemic was the occasion, so to speak,\r\nof a social revolution at Quebec; the land on the St. Louis and Ste. Foye\r\nroads became much enhanced in value; the wealthy quitted the Lower Town.\r\nCommercial affairs, however, still continued to be transacted there, but\r\nthe residences of merchants were selected in the Upper Town or in the\r\ncountry parts adjacent.\r\n\r\nThe _Fief Sault-au-Matelot_, which at present belongs to the Seminary, was\r\ngranted to Guillaume Hébert on the 4th February, 1623, the title of which\r\nwas ratified by the Due de Ventadour on the last day of February, 1632. On\r\nthe ground reclaimed from the river, about 1815, Messrs. Munro and Bell,\r\neminent merchants, built wharves and some large warehouses, to which lead\r\n\"Bell's lane,\" (so named after the Honorable Matthew Bell) [113] the\r\nstreets St. James, Arthur, Dalhousie and others. Mr. Bell, at a later\r\nperiod, one of the lessees of the St. Maurice Forges, resided in the\r\nhouse--now St. Lawrence Chambers--situate at the corner of St. James and\r\nSt. Peter streets, now belonging to Mr. John Greaves Clapham, N. P. Hon.\r\nMatthew Bell commanded a troop of cavalry, which was much admired by those\r\nwarlike gentlemen of 1812--our respected fathers. He left a numerous\r\nfamily, and was related by marriage to the families Montizambert, Bowen,\r\n&c. Dalhousie street, in the Lower Town, probably dates from the time of\r\nthe Earl of Dalhousie (1827), when the \"Quebec Exchange\" was built by a\r\ncompany of merchants. The extreme point of the Lower Town, towards the\r\nnortheast, constitutes \"La Pointe à Carcy,\" named after Carcy Pagès, who\r\nsucceeded to the office of \"Guardian of the Harbor,\" held in 1713 by Louis\r\nPratt. In the offing is situated the wharf, alongside of which the stately\r\nfrigate _Aurora_, Captain De Horsey, passed the winter of 1866-7. The\r\nwharves of the Quebec docks now mark the spot.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of commerce at the commencement of the present century and\r\nincrease of population rendered it very desirable that means of\r\ncommunication should be established between the Lower Town and St. Roch,\r\nless rugged and inconvenient than the tunnel--Sous-le-Cap lane--and the\r\nsandy beach of the river St. Charles at low water. Towards 1816 the\r\nnorthern extremity of St. Peter street was finished, it was previously\r\nbounded by a red bridge, well remembered by our very old citizens. The\r\nApostle St. Paul was honoured with a street, as was his colleague, St.\r\nPeter. Messrs. Benj. Tremaine, Budden, Morrisson, Parent, Allard and\r\nothers acquired portions of ground on the north side of this (St. Paul)\r\nstreet, upon which they have erected wharves, offices and large\r\nwarehouses. Renaud's new block now occupies a portion of the site.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the North Shore Railway will have the effect, at an\r\nearly date, of augmenting, in a marked degree, the value of these\r\nproperties, the greater portion of which now belong to our fellow citizen,\r\nM. J. Bte Renaud, who has adorned this portion of the Lower Town with\r\nfirst class buildings. Let us hope that this quarter may flourish, and\r\nthat our enterprising fellow citizen may prosper in consequence.\r\n\r\nLet us join a party of distinguished strangers wending their way through\r\nour muddy streets, following a titled tourist, His Highness the Duke of\r\nSaxe-Weimar. This noble visitor's rank seems to have been fully\r\nrecognized, since he was escorted by a guard of honour furnished by the\r\nLt.-Governor, and saluted on his departure by 21 guns. After fifty-five\r\nyears, the Duke's utterances have yet interest for us, though he seems to\r\nhave judged harshly the absent Governor-General, the Earl of Dalhousie.\r\n[114]\r\n\r\n    \"About eight o'clock in the evening of the 3rd of September, 1825, we\r\n    embarked at Montreal on board the steamer _Lady Sherbrooke_ for\r\n    Quebec. The banks, which as far as Trois Rivières are pretty low,\r\n    become higher and more rocky, particularly on the left side. The\r\n    neighborhood is remarkably handsome and picturesque. The majestic\r\n    stream with its pleasant banks, and the view of the distant blue\r\n    mountains near Quebec, produce an indescribable effect. The weather\r\n    was favourable,--a clear, sunny sky and not very warm; in this\r\n    northern latitude you can perceive the approaching autumn by the\r\n    coolness of the nights and mornings. We reached Quebec at 10 o'clock\r\n    in the evening. This city consists of two parts, the Upper Town, which\r\n    is built on a rock, and the Lower, which is pressed in between the\r\n    river and the rock. The lights in the Lower Town and the\r\n    fortifications had an elegant appearance, when contrasted with the\r\n    dark rock. The first _coup d'oeil_, which was by night, reminded\r\n    me of Namur, as it is seen from the right bank of the Maas. In the\r\n    river were many vessels; mostly used for carrying wood. It was already\r\n    late, and we should have found difficulty in transporting our baggage\r\n    by night, besides other inconveniences in finding lodgings for the\r\n    ladies, so we spent the second night also on board the steamboat,\r\n    where we were very comfortable and found it cleanly.\r\n\r\n    \"The next morning, after dismissing the guard which the Governor\r\n    appointed to escort us, we went to our lodgings in the upper part of\r\n    the town. The lower town is very narrow, and has a filthy appearance.\r\n    The streets are not paved, and badly provided with sidewalks. The road\r\n    which leads to the upper part of the town is very steep. It stands on\r\n    a rocky ground, and its fortifications are elevated 300 feet from the\r\n    level of the ocean. The upper is separated from the lower town by a\r\n    stone wall, which has the form of a horn-work. Through this wall is a\r\n    gate, [115] which has a guard; the guard-room is opposite the gate,\r\n    and by means of a portcullis defends the entrance. For the convenience\r\n    of foot-passengers there is a door [116] near the gate, with wooden\r\n    stairs, by ascending which you reach the upper town. On the right of\r\n    the gate is a building which resembles a chapel, [117] and serves for\r\n    the House of Commons of Canada. In order to get home we were obliged\r\n    to go round part of the walls of the town. Even here you have an\r\n    indescribably beautiful view of the Bay of Quebec and the right bank\r\n    of the river, which has the appearance of a cape, called Point Levi.\r\n\r\n    \"Shortly after our arrival, I received a visit from Colonel Duchesnay,\r\n    First Adjutant of the Governor-General, and from [118] Colonel\r\n    Durnford, Director of Engineers. The first gentleman came to bid me\r\n    welcome in the name of the Governor, and the latter begged to show me\r\n    the fortifications. Lord Dalhousie, Governor General of all British\r\n    possessions in North America, was at that time in England, but was\r\n    expected daily. During his absence, the Government was under the\r\n    direction of the Lt.-Governor, Sir Francis Barton, brother of Lord\r\n    Conyngham. He is a civilian, but is said to fill his high post with\r\n    credit. The good spirit the inhabitants are in, and the harmony that\r\n    exists in the colony, are mostly owing to his good management and his\r\n    humane and friendly deportment towards them. It is said of Lord\r\n    Dalhousie that he has estranged the hearts of the people from himself\r\n    and the Government, through his haughty and absolute deportment, and\r\n    the Opposition party in the Canadian Parliament has thereby been\r\n    strengthened.\r\n\r\n    \"The upper part of the town is very old and angular, the streets are\r\n    muddy, and many not paved. Both towns contain about 25,000\r\n    inhabitants. The Catholic Cathedral is quite a handsome building, it\r\n    has three altars, and paintings of but little value. It is near the\r\n    Seminary, an old French building, with massive walls, having four\r\n    corners like a bastion. In this Seminary resides the Bishop of Quebec.\r\n    We had already been introduced to Bishop Plessis, in the house of Sir\r\n    Francis Burton, and found him a very agreeable and well-informed man.\r\n    He is the son of a butcher of Montreal, and has elevated himself by\r\n    his own merit.\r\n\r\n    \"On the second and last day of my sojourn in Quebec I went to the\r\n    parade, escorted by Colonels Durnford and Duchesnay. I was pleasantly\r\n    taken by surprise when I found the whole garrison under arms. The\r\n    commanding officers wished to show me their corps. On the right wing\r\n    stood two companies of artillery, then a company of sappers and\r\n    miners, after this, the Sixty-Eighth, and lastly, the Seventy-First\r\n    Regiment of Infantry. The last is a light regiment, and consists of\r\n    Scotch Highlanders; it appeared to be in particularly good condition.\r\n    This regiment is not dressed in the Highland uniform, which was only\r\n    worn by some of the buglemen. It has a very good band of buglemen, who\r\n    wear curious caps, made of blue woollen, bordered below with red and\r\n    white stripes. The troops defiled twice before me.\r\n\r\n    \"On the 6th of September we set out in the steamboat for Montreal. Sir\r\n    Francis sent us his carriage, which was very useful to the ladies. On\r\n    the dock stood a company of the Sixty-Fifth Regiment, with their flags\r\n    displayed as a guard of honour, which I immediately dismissed. The\r\n    fortifications saluted us with 21 guns; this caused a very fine echo\r\n    from the mountains. Night soon set in, but we had sufficient light to\r\n    take leave of the magnificent vicinity of Quebec.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Vallier street is sacred to Monseigneur de St. Vallier; his name is\r\nidentified with the street which he so often perambulated in his visits to\r\nthe General Hospital, where he terminated his useful career in 1729. His\r\nLordship seems to have entertained a particular attachment for the\r\nlocality where he had founded this hospital, where he resided, in order to\r\nrent his Mountain Hill Palace to Intendant Talon, and thus save the\r\nexpense of a chaplain. The General Hospital was the third asylum for the\r\ninfirm which the Bishop had founded. Subsequently, came the Intendant de\r\nMeules, who, toward 1684, endowed the eastern portion of the quarter with\r\nan edifice (the Intendant's Palace) remarkable for its dimensions, its\r\nmagnificence and its ornate gardens.\r\n\r\nWhere Talon (a former Intendant) had left a brewery in a state of ruin and\r\nabout seventeen acres of land unoccupied, Louis XIV., by the advice of his\r\nIntendant de Meules, lavished vast sums of money in the erection of a\r\nsumptuous palace, in which French justice was administered, and in which,\r\nat a later period, under Bigot, it was _purchasable_. Our illustrious\r\nancestors, for that matter, were not the kind of men to weep over such\r\ntrifles, imbued as they were from infancy with the feudal system and all\r\nits irksome duties, without forgetting the forced labour (_corvées_)\r\nand those admirable \"Royal secret warrants,\" (_lettres de cachet_). What\r\ndid the institutions of a free people, or the text of Magna Charta signify\r\nto them?\r\n\r\nOn this spot stood the notorious warehouse, where Bigot, Cadet and their\r\nconfederates retailed, at enormous profits, the provisions and supplies\r\nwhich King Louis XV. doled out in 1758 to the starving inhabitants of\r\nQuebec. The people christened the house \"_La Friponne_,\" (_The Cheat_!!)\r\nNear the sight of Talon's old brewery which had been converted into a\r\nprison by Frontenac, and which held fast, until his trial in 1674, the\r\nAbbé de Fénélon [119] now stands the Anchor Brewery (Boswell's).\r\n\r\nWe clip the following from an able review in the Toronto _Mail_, Dec.,\r\n1880, of M. Marmette's most dramatic novel, \"_l'Intendant Bigot_\":\r\n\r\n    \"In the year 1775 a grievous famine raged, sweeping off large numbers\r\n    of the poor, while the unscrupulous Bigot and his satellites were\r\n    revelling in shameless profligacy. It is midnight of Christmas, when\r\n    an old officer, M. de Rochebrune, pressed with cold and hunger to the\r\n    last point, resolved to pawn his St. Louis Cross of gold at the\r\n    Intendant's Palace stores. On the way thither the officer and his\r\n    young daughter, a young girl of fourteen, are startled at the blaze of\r\n    light illuminating the Palace windows, during one of the Intendant's\r\n    festivals. The pleasures of the evening are suddenly interrupted and\r\n    shaded by the entry of the aged, suffering M. de Rochebrune and his\r\n    wan-visaged but beautiful daughter. Words of galling truth are\r\n    addressed to Bigot before his painted courtezans and his other\r\n    depraved attendants, whose hearts are too hard and whose consciences\r\n    are too seared to be tortured by either misery or reproof, and the\r\n    ruffian varlets eject both father and daughter to the furies of the\r\n    midnight blast. The ball ended, Bigot leads Madame de Pean to her\r\n    vehicle, when she tumbles over an object which, when torches are\r\n    brought, was found to be the corpse of the suppliant rebuker of a few\r\n    hours previous, alongside of which lay the unconscious form of his\r\n    daughter, half buried in the drifting snow. '_Mon Dieu_,' exclaimed\r\n    Madame de Pean, '_Il ne dormira pas de la nuit, c'est bien sûr._' This\r\n    tragic event is narrated with thrilling effect, in the author's best\r\n    style.\"     P. B.\r\n\r\nIn a paper read by us before the Literary and Historical Society of\r\nQuebec, 3rd December, 1879, we alluded in the following terms to the\r\nhistory of the \"Friponne\" and the infamous entourage of Intendant Bigot in\r\nthe second part of our lecture: the first part related to Kalm's ramble\r\nround the city in 1749.\r\n\r\n    Prepare, now for other--dark--far less pleasant scenes. The bright sky\r\n    of old Stadacona will rapidly lower; leaden clouds, pregnant with\r\n    storms are hovering over head. The simplicity of early days is getting\r\n    obsolete. Vice, gilded vice, flaunts in the palace. Gaunt famine is\r\n    preying on the vitals of the people. 'Tis so at Versailles; 'tis so at\r\n    Quebec. Lust--selfishness--rapine--public plunder everywhere--except\r\n    among the small party of the _Honnêtes Gens_: [120] a carnival of\r\n    pleasure, to be followed by the voice of wailing and by the roll of\r\n    the muffled drum.\r\n\r\n    In 1748, the evil genius of New France, \"La Pompadour's\r\n    _protégé_\" François Bigot, thirteenth and last Intendant, had landed\r\n    at Quebec.\r\n\r\n    Born in Guienne, of a family distinguished at the bar, Bigot, prior to\r\n    coming to Canada had occupied the high post of Intendant in Louisiana.\r\n    In stature, he was small--but well formed;--active--full of pluck--\r\n    fond of display and pleasure--an inveterate gambler. Had he confined\r\n    his operations merely to trading, his commercial ventures would have\r\n    excited little blame, trading having been a practice indulged in by\r\n    several other high colonial officials. His salary was totally\r\n    inadequate to the importance of his office, and quite insufficient to\r\n    meet the expenditure his exalted position led him into. His\r\n    speculations, his venality, the extortions practised on the community\r\n    by his heartless minions: this is what has surrounded his memory with\r\n    eternal infamy and made his name a by-word for scorn.\r\n\r\n    There existed, at Quebec, a _ring_ composed of the Intendant's\r\n    secretary, Deschenaux, of the Commissary General of Supplies, Cadet,\r\n    of the Town-Major, Hugues Péan; of the Treasurer-General, Imbert. Péan\r\n    was the Chief and Bigot the Great Chief of this nefarious association.\r\n    Between Bigot and Péan, another link existed. Péan's favour at Court\r\n    lay in the charms of his wife. Madame Péan, _née_ Angélique De\r\n    Meloises, was young, pretty, witty and charming; a fluent and\r\n    agreeable speaker--in fact so captivating that François Bigot was\r\n    entirely ruled by her during all his stay at Quebec. At her house in\r\n    St. Louis street he spent his evenings; there, he was sought and found\r\n    in May, 1759, by Col. de Bougainville returning from Paris, the bearer\r\n    of the dispatches, announcing the coming struggle.\r\n\r\n    Would you like some of the pen-photographs which a clever French\r\n    contemporary [121] has left of the corrupt entourage of the\r\n    magnificent intendant, here are a few:\r\n\r\n    \"Brassard Deschenaux, the son of a poor cobbler, was born at Quebec. A\r\n    notary who boarded with Deschenaux, senior, had taught his son to\r\n    read. Naturally quick and intelligent, young Deschenaux made rapid\r\n    progress and soon found something to do in the office of Intendant\r\n    Hocquart where Bigot found him and succeeded in having him appointed\r\n    clerk in the Colonial Office at Quebec. Industrious, but at heart a\r\n    sycophant, by dint of cringing he won the good graces of Bigot, who\r\n    soon put unlimited trust in him, to that degree as to do nothing\r\n    without Deschenaux's aid, but Deschenaux was vain, ambitious, haughty\r\n    and overbearing and of such inordinate greed, that he was in the habit\r\n    of boasting 'that to get rich he would even rob a church.'\r\n\r\n    \"Cadet was the son of a butcher. In his youth he was employed to mind\r\n    the cattle of a Charlesbourg peasant; he next set up as a butcher and\r\n    made money. His savings, he invested in trade; his intriguing spirit\r\n    brought him to the notice of the Intendant Hocquart, who gave him\r\n    contracts to supply meat for the army. Deschenaux soon discovered that\r\n    Cadet could be useful to him; he made him his friend and lost no\r\n    opportunity to recommend him to the Intendant. He was accordingly\r\n    often employed to buy the supplies for the subsistence of the troops.\r\n    In verity, there were few men more active, more industrious, more\r\n    competent to drive a bargain. The King required his services and\r\n    secured them, by having Cadet named Commissary General. He had his\r\n    redeeming points--was open-handed in his dealings--of a kindly nature\r\n    and lavish even to excess.\"\r\n\r\n    The worthy Commissary General, like Péan, was blessed with a charming\r\n    wife, whom Panet's Diary styles \"La Belle Amazone Aventurière.\"\r\n    Probably like her worthy spouse,--of low extraction; \"elle n'était pas\r\n    sortie de la cuisse de Jupiter,\" to use a familiar French saw.\r\n\r\n    She certainly was not, like Caesar's wife \"above suspicion.\" Madame\r\n    Cadet, later on, transferred her allegiance from the rich butcher\r\n    Cadet, to one \"Sieur Joseph Ruffio\";... but let us draw the veil of\r\n    oblivion over the short comings of another age.\r\n\r\n    \"Capt. Hughes Péan, _Chevalier de la Livaudière_, was Town Major\r\n    of Quebec, _aide-Major des Troupes_.\" He was not long in discovering\r\n    that with an Intendant like Bigot, he could dare anything. Had he not\r\n    without any trouble netted a gain of 50,000 half crowns? A large\r\n    quantity of wheat was required for Government; he was charged with the\r\n    purchase. There was a fat job in store for the Town Major. How was his\r\n    master the Intendant to manage the matter for him? Bigot was a man of\r\n    resource, who never forgot his friends. First, he provided Péan with a\r\n    large sum out of the Treasury to buy the wheat as low as possible for\r\n    cash; and then his complaisant council passed an order or Ordonnance\r\n    fixing the price of grain much higher than that at which Péan had\r\n    purchased. The town Major charged it to the Government at the rate\r\n    fixed by the Ordonnance; the difference left him a handsome profit. He\r\n    thought he would next try his hand at building coasting craft, which\r\n    he could manage to keep constantly in commission for Government; this\r\n    also was lucrative. Other devices, however, were resorted to; a secret\r\n    partnership was entered into between Cadet and a person named Clavery,\r\n    who shortly after become store-keeper at Quebec. Cadet was to purchase\r\n    wheat in the parishes, have it ground at a mill he had leased, the\r\n    flour to be sent abroad, secretly. Péan, too, had large warehouses\r\n    built--at Beaumont some say. Cargoes of grain were thus secretly\r\n    shipped to foreign ports in defiance of the law. Bréard, the\r\n    Comptroller-General, for a consideration winked at these mal-\r\n    practices, and from a poor man when he landed in Canada, he returned\r\n    to France in affluent circumstances.\r\n\r\n    The crowning piece of knavery was the erection of a vast shop and\r\n    warehouses near to the Intendant's Palace. Clavery had charge of this\r\n    establishment, where a small retail business was carried on as a\r\n    blind. The real object was to monopolize the trade in provisions and\r\n    concentrate it here. Clavery was clerk to Estebe, Royal store-keeper\r\n    at Quebec. In this warehouse were accumulated all such provisions and\r\n    supplies as were wanted annually, and ordered from France for the\r\n    King's stores at Quebec.\r\n\r\n    It was the practice of the Intendant to send each summer the\r\n    requisitions to Paris. Bigot took care to order from France less\r\n    supplies than were required, so as to have an excuse to order the\r\n    remainder in times of want, at Quebec. The orders were sent to\r\n    Clavery's warehouse, where the same goods were sold twice over, at\r\n    increased rates. Soon the people saw through the deceit, and this\r\n    repository of fraud was called in consequence La Friponne, \"The\r\n    Knave.\"\r\n\r\n    Want of space prevents me from crowding in photos of the other\r\n    accomplished rogues, banded together for public robbery during the\r\n    expiring years of French domination in Canada.\r\n\r\n    It is singular to note how many low-born [122] parasites and\r\n    flatterers surrounded Bigot.\r\n\r\n    In 1755, the wheat harvest having failed, and the produce of former\r\n    years having been carried out of Canada or else stored in the magazine\r\n    of Bigot's ring, the people of Canada were reduced to starvation: in\r\n    many instances they had to subsist on horse flesh and decayed codfish.\r\n    Instead of having recourse to the wheat stored here, the Intendant's\r\n    minions led him to believe that wheat was not so scarce as the\r\n    peasantry pretended--that the peasants refused to sell it, merely in\r\n    anticipation of obtaining still higher rates; that the Intendant, they\r\n    argued, ought to issue orders, for domiciliary visits in the rural\r\n    districts; and levy a tax on each inhabitant of the country, for the\r\n    maintenance of the residents in the city, and of the troops.\r\n\r\n    Statements were made out, shewing the rations required to prevent the\r\n    people from dying of hunger. Cadet was charged with the raising of\r\n    this vexatious impost. In a very short time, he and his clerks had\r\n    overrun the country, appropriating more wheat than was necessary. Some\r\n    of the unfortunate peasants, who saw in the loss of their seed wheat\r\n    starvation and death, loudly complained. A few called at the\r\n    Intendant's Palace, but the heartless Deschenaux, the Intendant's\r\n    Secretary, was ever on the watch and had them questioned by his\r\n    _employés_, and when the object of their visit, was discovered,\r\n    they were ushered into the presence of Deschenaux, who insulted them\r\n    and threatened to have them imprisoned for thus presuming to complain\r\n    to the Intendant. Bigot was afterwards advised of their visit, and\r\n    when they appeared before him they were so maltreated and bullied that\r\n    they left, happy in the fact that they had not been thrown into\r\n    prison; soon, none dared to complain. Bread was getting scarcer every\r\n    day. The Intendant had named persons to distribute the bread at the\r\n    baker's shops, the flour being furnished by Government. The people\r\n    crowded the bakeries on the days fixed; the loaves were taken by\r\n    violence, mothers of families used to complain that they could not get\r\n    any; they used occasionally to besiege the Intendant at his Palace\r\n    with their lamentations and complaints, but it was of no avail, the\r\n    Intendant was surrounded by a crowd of flatterers, who on retiring,\r\n    gorged from his luxurious board, could not understand how the poor\r\n    could die of hunger.\r\n\r\n    Land of my fathers reclaimed from barbarism at the cost of so much\r\n    blood--so much treasure, bountifully provided with nobles--priests--\r\n    soldiers--fortifications by the great Louis; sedulously--paternally\r\n    watched over by Colbert and Talon: to what depth of despair, shall we\r\n    say, degradation are thou sunk!\r\n\r\n    Proud old city, have you then no more defenders to put forth, in your\r\n    supreme hour of woe and desertion! Has then that dauntless race of\r\n    _Gentilshommes Canadiens_, d'Iberville--Ste. Hélène--de Bouville\r\n    --de Bécancourt--de Repentigny, disappeared without leaving any\r\n    successors!\r\n\r\n    And you stern old de Frontenac, you who replied so effectually to the\r\n    invader through the mouth of your cannon, is your martial spirit\r\n    quenched forever, in that loved fortress in which rest your venerated\r\n    remains, you who at one time (1689) were ready, at the head of your\r\n    Regulars and fighting Canadians, [123] to carry out the rash scheme,\r\n    hatched by deCallières: the conquest of New York and destruction of\r\n    the chief settlements in New England, a scheme which involved the\r\n    dispersion of more than eighteen thousand people, as sixty-six years\r\n    later (in 1755), a British Commander tore from their homes the\r\n    peaceable Acadians of _Grand-Pré_. [124]\r\n\r\n    I could enlarge to any extent the gloomy picture which the history of\r\n    this shameful period discloses. Two skilful novelists, the one in the\r\n    English language, Wm. Kirby, [125] Esq., of Niagara, the other in the\r\n    French, Joseph Marmette, [126] of Quebec, have woven two graphic and\r\n    stirring historical romances, out of the materials which the career of\r\n    the Intendant Bigot and the desertion of the colony in its hour of\r\n    trial, by France--so abundantly supply. One redeeming _trait_, one\r\n    flash of sunshine lights up the last hour of French domination: the\r\n    devotion of the Canadian militia towards their oblivious mother-\r\n    country, their dauntless courage at the Beauport engagement--after the\r\n    battle of the Plains, 13th Sept., 1759--and at the battle of Ste.\r\n    Foye, on the 28th April 1760, a day glorious to French arms, but at\r\n    best a useless victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _RUINS OF THE INTENDANT'S PALACE._\r\n\r\n    \"It is the voice of years that are gone! they roll before me with all\r\n    their deeds.\"--OSSIAN.\r\n\r\n    \"'The descriptions, or perspective sketches,' says Mr. Walkem,\r\n    'according to the fancy or whim of the artist or the photographer, of\r\n    what is left of the ruins, convey no adequate idea of its real\r\n    capacity and magnitude in length, breadth or height. My present\r\n    object, therefore, with your permission, is to supply this deficiency\r\n    from plans and elevations drawn to a scale of feet about the year\r\n    1770--when some repairs were effected by the Military Engineers,--five\r\n    years before its destruction in 1775. And more especially do I feel it\r\n    my duty to submit this plan, &c., for publication since it has become\r\n    part of the military history, not of Quebec only, but of Canada.\r\n\r\n    \"The following is an extract from the Centenary report: 'This once\r\n    magnificent pile was constructed under the French King's directions in\r\n    1684, under Intendant de Meules. It was burnt in 1712, when occupied\r\n    by Intendant Bégon, and restored by the French Government. It became,\r\n    from 1748 to 1759, the luxurious resort of Intendant Bigot and his\r\n    wassailers. Under English rule it was neglected, and Arnold's men\r\n    having, from the cupola, annoyed Guy Carleton's soldiers, orders were\r\n    given to destroy it with the city guns.'\r\n\r\n    \"'Skulking riflemen in St. Roch's, watching behind walls to kill our\r\n    sentries, some of them fired from the cupola of the Intendant's\r\n    Palace. We brought a nine-pounder to answer them.'--(_Extract from a\r\n    journal of an officer of the Quebec Garrison_.)\r\n\r\n    \"For those who may not be familiar with the meaning of the term\r\n    'Intendant,' and the official duties of his office, the following\r\n    remarks are submitted from the most authentic sources. It was one of\r\n    civil administration, direction management, superintendence, &c., and\r\n    next to that of Governor-General, the office of Intendant was one of\r\n    the greatest importance and celebrity in Quebec. It was established by\r\n    the proclamation of the King of France in 1663,--creating a Sovereign\r\n    Council for the affairs of the Colony--viz: the Governor-General, the\r\n    Bishop, the Intendant and four Councillors, with an Attorney-General\r\n    and Chief Clerk. The number of Councillors was afterwards increased to\r\n    twelve.\r\n\r\n    \"The authority of the Intendant, except in his executive capacity, was\r\n    indeed little inferior to that of the Governor himself. He had the\r\n    superintendence of four departments, viz: Justice, Police, Finance,\r\n    and Marine.\r\n\r\n    The first intendant named under the proclamation of 1663 was M.\r\n    Robert; but he never came to Canada to fill his office, and it was not\r\n    till the summer of 1655 that Jean de Talon arrived at Quebec, as the\r\n    first real Intendant, with the Viceroy deTracy, and the Carignan\r\n    Regiment. The building in which the Sovereign Council first held their\r\n    meetings would appear to have stood on the south side of Fabrique\r\n    street westward (?) of the Jesuit College, known at that time as the\r\n    'Treasury.'\r\n\r\n    \"During the Intendancy of M. de Meules, in 1684, that gentleman, at\r\n    his own expense, endowed the eastern portion of the St. Roch's suburbs\r\n    with an edifice henceforth known as the 'Intendant's Palace' ('Le\r\n    Palais'), remarkable for its dimensions, magnificence and general\r\n    appearance; it included also (according to old plans) about ten acres\r\n    of land contained probably between St. Rochs and St. Nicholas streets,\r\n    having the River St. Charles in front, and afterwards laid out in\r\n    ornamental gardens. The Palace was described by _La Potherie_, in\r\n    1698, as consisting of eighty toises, or 480 feet of buildings, so\r\n    that it appeared a little town in itself. The King's stores were also\r\n    kept there.\r\n\r\n    \"In 1712, Intendant Bégon, with a splendid equipage and retinue,\r\n    arrived in Quebec from France, and took up his residence at the\r\n    Palace. On the 5th of January, 1713, the entire building and premises\r\n    unfortunately were destroyed by fire, and such was the rapidity of the\r\n    flames that the Intendant and his wife escaped with great difficulty.\r\n    Madame Bégon was obliged to break the panes of glass in her apartment\r\n    before she had power to breathe. The young lady attendants were burned\r\n    to death. The Intendant's _valet de chambre_, anxious to save some of\r\n    his master's wardrobe, also perished in the flames. His Secretary,\r\n    passing barefooted from the Palace to the river front, was so much\r\n    frozen that he died in the Hospital of the Hôtel-Dieu a few days\r\n    afterwards. [127]\r\n\r\n    \"The Palace was afterward rebuilt under the direction of M. Bégon at\r\n    the expense of His Majesty, and of which the plans and elevation now\r\n    presented are presumed to be a correct and faithful illustration. The\r\n    principal entrance appears to have been from that side next the cliff,\r\n    opposite the 'Arsenal,'--or from the present line of St. Valier\r\n    street--with large store buildings, magazines, &c., on either side of\r\n    the entrance, and in the rear of that stood the building known as the\r\n    'Prison.' It would appear that _La Potherie's_ remark, in 1698,\r\n    of the first construction resembling a little town in itself, would\r\n    also apply to the group of the second construction--as no less than\r\n    twenty in number are shown on some of the old plans of this period.\r\n    From sketches taken on the spot by an officer of the Fleet in Wolfe's\r\n    expedition of 1759, and published in London two years afterwards,\r\n    there can be little doubt, for want of room elsewhere, that the Palace\r\n    was converted into barracks and occupied immediately after the\r\n    surrender of Quebec by the troops under General Murray, and continued\r\n    to be used as such until it fell into the hands of the American\r\n    insurgents under Arnold, in 1775, and was destroyed by the cannon from\r\n    the ramparts. The assumption is strengthened, if not confirmed, by the\r\n    occupation of the Jesuit College as barracks the following year the\r\n    amount of accommodation in both cases, a full regiment--would be the\r\n    same; hence the comfortable quarters in the 'Palais' by the rebel\r\n    force under Arnold, which would accommodate the most of his men.\r\n\r\n    \"The appearance of this once celebrated structure in its general\r\n    aspect was more imposing from its extent than from any architectural\r\n    ornate embellishments. The style was the French domestic of that\r\n    period, of two clear stories in height, the extreme frontage was 260\r\n    feet, with projecting wings at either end of 20 feet (vide plan), the\r\n    depth from the front of the wings to the rear line 75 feet, and the\r\n    central part 58 feet; the height from the site level to the apex of\r\n    roof about 55 feet, and to the eaves line about 33 feet; in the\r\n    basement there were no less than 9 vaults, 10 feet high to the crown\r\n    of the arch running along the whole front, as shown in the elevation.\r\n    The apartments in the two stories are divided longitudinally by a wall\r\n    from one end to the other, and comprise altogether about 40 in number,\r\n    allotted into barrack-rooms as per original military plans.\r\n\r\n    \"The roof is plain and steep, and only broken by the pedimented wings\r\n    at each end of the building, with chimney stacks and stone coping over\r\n    the transverse fire walls, and otherwise relieved by a small octagonal\r\n    cupola of two sections placed in the centre of the roof. The approach\r\n    to the building in front is by two flights of steps, an enclosed porch\r\n    forming a central feature to the main entrance; the basement windows\r\n    are shewn in the elevation above the ground line. The walls were\r\n    substantially built of black slate rock peculiar to Quebec and must\r\n    have taken much time in the erection judging from its tenacity, and\r\n    the hardness of the material still remaining. No doubt the walls, as\r\n    was the practice in those days, were built of dry masonry, a few feet\r\n    at a time, and then _grouted_ with mortar in a thin semi-fluid\r\n    state, composed of quicklime and fine sand poured into the interspaces\r\n    of the stone-work, filling every cavity, excluding the air, and left\r\n    to dry before commencing the next course. The wrought stone at the\r\n    quoins and angles appear to have been quarried at Point-aux-Trembles,\r\n    or more likely at Beauport, while the sides of the doors and windows\r\n    were faced with hard Flemish brick, still intact, and beyond doubt\r\n    imported directly from France. [128] The main store buildings in\r\n    front, with vaults underneath, were undoubtedly built in the same\r\n    compact manner, as Mr. Boswell, some years ago, in excavating for his\r\n    brewery on the site of these stores, came in contact with the old\r\n    foundation walls, so hard that powder had to be used for blasting. The\r\n    mortar was found to be harder than stone, and a drill had but small\r\n    effect upon it. That gentleman many years ago became the tenant of the\r\n    war department for these ruins and vaults, and has roofed them in,\r\n    taken care of the property and made improvements generally at his own\r\n    expense. There is an old story current that a subterraneous passage,\r\n    under the old ruins, led to the river. Others say that a passage\r\n    communicated with the Upper Town. It is highly probable the old vaults\r\n    and passage discovered by Mr. Boswell in the above excavation have\r\n    been the origin of this story; for in one case towards the river it\r\n    would be flooded at high water, and towards the Upper Town barred by a\r\n    rampart of solid rock.\r\n\r\n    \"From 1775 to the withdrawal of the Imperial troops in 1870-71--\r\n    nearly a century,--this property was used specially for military\r\n    purposes, and commonly known, as shown on old plan, as the King's Wood\r\n    Yard, and more recently as the Commissariat Fuel Yard. The land\r\n    several years ago was reduced in extent by the sale of building lots\r\n    on the lines of St. Valier and St. Nicholas streets.\r\n\r\n    \"At the beginning of this century, and many years afterwards, a\r\n    military guard seems to have done duty at the 'Palais' and adjoining\r\n    premises, east of St. Nicholas street, known as the Royal Dock Yard,\r\n    King's Wharf, Stores, &c. This latter property extended eastward as\r\n    far as La Canoterie, in front of a blockhouse, the site of the present\r\n    Nunnery Bastion, and lying between what is now known as St. Charles\r\n    street, or the foot of the cliff, and the high water mark on the north\r\n    side, corresponding pretty nearly with the line of St. Paul street.\r\n\r\n    \"The ruins of 'Le Palais' and accessories since 1775 were several\r\n    times fitted up by the military authorities for stabling, fodder-\r\n    sheds, wash-house, military stores, caretaker's quarters, &c., &c.,\r\n    and the vaults were leased for storing ice, wines and other liquors,\r\n    and storage generally to the inhabitants of the city, and the roof was\r\n    shingled or otherwise covered in on several occasions by the\r\n    Government.\r\n\r\n    \"In the great fire of St. Roch's (1845) the Fuel Yard, about four\r\n    acres in extent, with some hundreds of cords of wood piled there, and\r\n    a very large quantity of coals in a 'lean-to-shed' against the Palais\r\n    walls were consumed--the coals continued to burn and smoulder for\r\n    nearly _six months_,--and notwithstanding the solidity of the\r\n    masonry, as already described, portions of it, with the heat like a\r\n    fiery furnace, gave way. Upon this occasion an unfortunate woman and\r\n    two children were burned to death in the Fuel Yard. Great efforts were\r\n    made by Mr. Bailey, a commissariat officer, and Mr. Boswell, owner of\r\n    the brewery, to save the lives of the victims, but unfortunately\r\n    without success. These gentlemen, after their coats had been burned\r\n    off their backs, and the hair from their heads and eyebrows, had to\r\n    fly at last to save their own lives.\r\n\r\n    \"On the withdrawal of the Imperial troops in 1870-71, the whole of 'Le\r\n    Palais' property was handed over to the Dominion Government.\r\n\r\n      \"CHARLES WALKEM, \"(Late R. E. Civil Service Staff in Canada.)\r\n      \"Ottawa, 24th July, 1876.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless to the eyes of the \"free and independent electors\" of La\r\nVacherie, in 1759, the Intendant's Palace seemed a species of \"eighth\r\nwonder\" The eighth wonder lost much of its _éclat_, however, by the\r\ninauguration of English rule, in 1759, but a total eclipse came over this\r\nimposing and majestic luminary when Guy Carleton's guns from the ramparts\r\nof Quebec began, in 1775, to thunder on its cupola and roof, which offered\r\na shelter to Arnold's soldiery: the rabble of \"shoemakers, hatters,\r\nblacksmiths and innkeepers,\" (says that savage old Tory, Colonel Henry\r\nCaldwell), bent on providing Canada with the blessings of Republicanism. A\r\ncentury and more has passed over the gorgeous Palace--now a dreary, moss-\r\ncovered ruin, surrounded in rear by coarse grass, fallen stones: Bigot--\r\nhis wassailers,--the fair but frail Madame de Pean, like her prototype of\r\nParis, Madame de Pompadour, have all fleeted to the land of shadows; and\r\ntourists, high and low, still crowd to glance meditatively at those fast\r\nfading traces of a guilty past. It was in October, 1879, the special\r\nprivilege of the writer to escort to these ruins one of our Sovereign's\r\ngentle and accomplished daughters, H.R.H. the Princess Louise, accompanied\r\nby H.E. Lord Lorne, as he had done the previous autumn with regard to the\r\nlearned Dean of Westminster, Revd. A. P. Stanley: proud he was to think\r\nthat though Quebec had no such attractions like antique, like classic\r\nEngland,--turretted castles, moated granges, or even\r\n\r\n             \"Old pheasant Lords,\r\n  \"Partridge breeders of a thousand years,\"\r\n\r\n--its romantic past was not without pleasing or startling or interesting\r\nmemories.\r\n\r\nWe have just mentioned \"_La Vacherie_\", this consisted of the extensive\r\nand moist pastures at the foot of _Coteau Sainte-Geneviève_, extending\r\ntowards the General Hospital, where the city cows were grazed; on this\r\nsite and gracing the handsome streets \"Crown\" \"Craig\" and \"Desfossés,\" can\r\nnow be seen elegant dry-goods stores, vying with the largest in the Upper\r\nTown. Had St. Peter street, in 1775, been provided with a regular way of\r\ncommunication with St. Roch; had St. Paul street then existed, the sun of\r\nprogress would have shone there nearly a century earlier.\r\n\r\n\"For a considerable time past, several plans of amelioration of the City\r\nof Quebec,\" says the Abbé Ferland, \"were proposed to the Ministry by M. de\r\nMeules. The absolute necessity of obtaining a desirable locality for the\r\nresidence of the Intendant, and for holding the sessions of the Council;\r\nthe Château St. Louis being hardly sufficient to afford suitable quarters\r\nfor the Governor and the persons who formed his household. M. de Meules\r\nproposed purchasing a large stone building which M. Talon had caused to be\r\nerected for the purpose of a brewery, and which, for several years, had\r\nremained unoccupied. Placed in a very commodious position on the bank of\r\nthe river St. Charles, and not many steps from the Upper Town, this\r\nedifice, with suitable repairs and additions, might furnish not alone a\r\ndesirable residence for the Intendant, but also halls and offices for the\r\nSupreme Council and the Courts of Justice, as likewise vaults for the\r\narchives and a prison for the criminals. Adjacent to the old brewery, M.\r\nTalon owned an extent of land of about seventeen superficial acres, of\r\nwhich no use was made in M. de Meules' plan; a certain portion of this\r\nland could be reserved for the gardens and dependencies of the Intendant's\r\nPalace, whilst the remainder might be portioned off into building lots\r\n(_emplacements_), and thus convert it into a second lower town, and\r\nwhich might some day be extended to the foot of the Cape. He believed that\r\nif this plan were adopted, the new buildings of Quebec would extend in\r\nthat direction, and not on the heights almost exclusively occupied by the\r\nReligious Communities. [129]\r\n\r\nWe perceive, according to Mr. Panet's Journal, that Saint Roch existed in\r\n1759; that the women and children, residents of that quarter, were not\r\nwholly indifferent to the fate of their distressed country. \"The same day\r\n(31st July, 1759),\" says Panet, \"we heard a great uproar in the St. Roch\r\nquarter--the women and children were shouting, 'Long Live the King!'\"\r\n[130] \"I ascended the height (on the _Coteau Ste. Geneviève_) and\r\nthere beheld the first frigate all in a blaze, very shortly afterwards a\r\nblack smoke issuing from the second, which blew up and afterwards took\r\nfire.\" On the 4th August several bomb-shells of 80 lbs. fell on St. Roch.\r\nWe read, that on the 31st August, two soldiers were hanged at three\r\no'clock in the afternoon, for having stolen a cask of brandy from the\r\nhouse of one Charland, in the St. Roch quarter. In those times the General\r\n(or _the Recorder_) did not do things by halves. Who was, this Charland of\r\n1759? Could he be the same who, sixteen years afterwards, fought so\r\nstoutly with Lieut. Dambourgès at the Sault-au-Matelot engagement? Since\r\nthe inauguration of the English domination, St. Roch became peopled in a\r\nmost rapid manner, we now see there a net-work of streets, embracing in\r\nextent several leagues.\r\n\r\nThe first steep hill past the Y. M. C. Association Hall--formerly Gallows\r\nHill, (where the luckless David McLane was disembowelled, in 1797, for\r\nlevying war against the King of Great Britain), and leading from St. John\r\nstreet without to that not over-straight thoroughfare, named after the\r\nsecond Bishop of Quebec--St. Vallier street--borrows its name from\r\nBarthélémy Coton, who in days of yore closed his career in Quebec at the\r\nadvanced age of 92 years. Can anyone tell us the pedigree of Barthélémy\r\nCoton? To the French portion of the inhabitants it is known as _Côte à\r\nCoton_, whilst the English portion still continue to surround it,\r\nunopportunely we think, with the unhallowed traditions of a lugubrious\r\npast and call it Gallows Hill. Côte à Coton debouches into St. Vallier\r\nstreet, which on your way takes you to Scott's Bridge, over the Little\r\nRiver St Charles. Across St. Vallier street it opens on a rather\r\nmagnificent street as to extent--Baronne street,--commemorating the\r\n_souvenir_ of an illustrious family in colonial History, represented\r\nby Madame la Baronne de Longueuil, the widow of the third Baron, who had,\r\nin 1770, married the Honorable. Wm. Grant, the Receiver-General of the\r\nProvince of Quebec, who lived at St. Rochs, and died there in 1805.\r\n\r\nOn M. P. Cousin's plan of Quebec, published in 1875, parallel to St.\r\nVallier street to the south, and St. Fleurie street to the north, halfway\r\nbetween, is laid down Baronne street. The most ancient highway of the\r\nquarter (St. Roch) is probably St. Vallier street. \"Desfossés\" street most\r\nlikely derives its name from the ditches (_fossés_) which served to\r\ndrain the green pastures of _La Vacherie_. The old Bridge street dates\r\nfrom the end of the last century (1789). \"Dorchester\" street recalls\r\nthe esteemed and popular administrator, Lord Dorchester, who, under the\r\nname of Guy Carleton, led on to victory the militia of Quebec in 1775.\r\n\r\n\"Craig\" street received its name from Sir John Craig, a gouty, testy, but\r\ntrusty old soldier, who administered the Government in 1807-9-10; it was\r\nenlarged and widened ten feet, after the great fire of 1845. The site of\r\nSt. Paul's Market was acquired from the Royal Ordnance, on 31st July,\r\n1831.\r\n\r\n    A former Quebecer writes:--\r\n\r\n    OTTAWA, 17th May, 1876.\r\n\r\n    \"At the beginning of this century only eighty square-rigged vessels\r\n    entered the Port of Quebec. There were then in Quebec only nine\r\n    importers, and half a dozen master mechanics, one shipyard (John\r\n    Black's, where one ship was launched each year), one printing office\r\n    and one weekly paper.\r\n\r\n    \"The tide then washed the rear walls of the houses on the north part\r\n    of Sault-au-Matelot street. The only deep water wharves were Dunières,\r\n    afterwards Brébaut's, Johnson & Purss', and the King's Wharf. There\r\n    were no dwelling houses beyond Dunières' Wharf, but a few huts were\r\n    built at the base of the cape. A black man was the solitary inhabitant\r\n    on the beach, and all the way to Sillery the woods extended to the\r\n    water's edge. A lease of this beach might then have been obtained for\r\n    £50 a year.\r\n\r\n    \"In St. Roch's Suburbs there was no house beyond the Manor House near\r\n    the Intendant's Palace, save a few straggling ones in St. Vallier and\r\n    St. Roch's streets. The site of the present Parish of St. Roch was\r\n    mostly occupied by Grant's Mills, by meadows and farms.\r\n\r\n    \"In St. John Suburbs there were only a few houses on St. John and St.\r\n    George's streets and St. Louis Suburbs which, in 1775, contributed but\r\n    three militia-men, viz--Jean Dobin, gardener, Jos. Proveau, carter,\r\n    and Jacques Dion, mason, could boast of only one house, and the\r\n    nearest one to it was Powell Place, Spencer Wood.\r\n\r\n    \"On the St. Foy Road there was no house beyond the mineral well in St.\r\n    John Suburbs, until you came to the Haut Bijou--Mr. Stewart's. The\r\n    population of the city was then estimated at 12,000.\r\n\r\n    \"I wonder if your friend Col. Strange is aware that his old friend\r\n    Sergt.

LEMOINE, Esq.\"\r\n\r\nIn the present day the prolongation of the wharf has left no trace of it;\r\nthe Station of the North Shore Railway covers a portion of this area.\r\n\r\n\"Church\" street (la rue de l'Église), doubtless owes its name to the\r\nerection of the beautiful Saint Roch Church, towards 1812, the site of\r\nwhich was given by the late Honorable John Mure, who died in Scotland in\r\n1823.\r\n\r\nSaint Roch, like the Upper Town, comprises several _Fiefs_, proceeding\r\nfrom the _Fief_ of the Seminary and reaching as far as the Gas Wharf; the\r\nbeaches with the right of fishing belonged originally to the _Hôtel-Dieu_\r\nby a concession dated the 31st March, 1648, but they have since been\r\nconceded to others. The Crown possesses an important reserve towards the\r\nwest of this grant; then comes the grant made, in 1814 or 1815, to the\r\nheirs of William Grant, now occupied by several ship-yards. Jacques\r\nCartier who, in 1535-6, wintered in the vicinity of Saint Roch, left his\r\nname to an entire municipal division of this rich suburb, as well as to a\r\nspacious market hall. (The Jacques Cartier Market Hall.) The first secular\r\npriest, who landed in Quebec on the 8th August, 1634, and who closed his\r\ndays in the Hôtel-Dieu on the 29th November, 1668, Jean le Sueur de Saint\r\nSauveur, left his name to what now constitutes the populous municipality\r\nof Saint Sauveur. (Casgrain, _Historie de l'Hôtel-Dieu_, p. 81.)\r\n\r\nOn the spot on which the General Hospital Convent was erected, in 1691,\r\nthe four first Franciscan Friars, Pères Jamay, D'Olbeau, LeCaron and Frère\r\nPacifique Du Plessis, who had landed at Quebec on the 2nd June, 1615, soon\r\nset to work to erect the first Church, the first Convent and the first\r\nSeminary in New France, and on the 3rd June, 1620, Father d'Olbeau, in the\r\nabsence of Father Jamay, the Superior of the Mission, placed the first\r\nstone of the church, under the name of _Notre Dame des Anges_, on the\r\n25th May, 1625. This was on the bank of the river which Jacques Cartier\r\nhad called the River Ste. Croix, because he had landed there on the 14th\r\nSeptember, 1535, the day of the exaltation of the Holy Cross: the Friars\r\nchanged the name to that of St. Charles, in honor of \"Monsieur Charles de\r\nBoues, Grand Vicaire _de Pontoise_,\" one of the most distinguished\r\nbenefactors of their Order.\r\n\r\nSt. Vallier street, leading to ancient and Indian Lorette, over the Little\r\nRiver Road, at present so well built up and echoing to the shrill whistle\r\nof the Q. M. O. & O. Railway, until a few years back was a lone\r\nthoroughfare, beyond the toll-bar, lined with bare, open meadows. Here,\r\nalso, has been felt the march of progress.\r\n\r\nIn the genial summer months passers-by are admonished by a pungent, not\r\nunhealthy, odor of tannin, an effluvia of tamarac bark, that tanners and\r\ncurriers have selected their head-quarters in St. Vallier street. History\r\nalso lends its attractions to the venerable thoroughfare.\r\n\r\nOur forefathers would tell of many cosy little dinners, closed, of course,\r\nwith whist or loo--of many _recherché_ pic-nics in days of yore, kept\r\nup until the \"sma' hours\" at two renowned hostelries, only recently\r\nremoved--the BLUE HOUSE and the RED HOUSE,--chiefly at that festive and\r\ncrowning season of the year, when\r\n\r\n  \"The snow, the beautiful snow,\"\r\n\r\ncalled forth the City Driving Club and its silvery, tinkling sleigh bells.\r\n\r\nA steward--once famous as a caterer--on closing his term of service at the\r\n_Château_, with a departing Governor, more than a century back, was\r\nthe Boniface at the Blue House: Alexandre Menut. A veritable Soyer was\r\n_Monsieur_ Menut. During the American invasion, in the autumn of 1775,\r\nMonsieur Menut, owing to a _vis major_, was forced to entertain a rather\r\nboisterous and wilful class of customers: Richard Montgomery and his\r\nwarlike Continentals. More than once a well-aimed ball or shell from\r\nGeneral Carleton's batteries in the city must have disturbed the good\r\ncheer of the New York and New England riflemen lounging about Menut's, a\r\ngreat rebel rendezvous in 1775-6, we are told, visible from afar, [131]\r\n\"with its white flag flying on the house.\r\n\r\nArnold's head-quarters being close to the St. Charles, where Scott's\r\nBridge was since built, the intervening space between the city and the\r\nGeneral Hospital was daily swept by Carleton's artillery. The Page Diaries\r\nabound with details of the casualties or narrow escapes of the invading\r\nhost. A few quotations will suffice:\r\n\r\n    \"8th December, 1775. Mr. (Brigadier-General) Montgomery visited\r\n    Menut's to-day; a few minutes after he got out of the cariole, a\r\n    cannon ball from the city walls killed his horse.\r\n\r\n    \"18th December. Some shells were thrown in to-day, and we threw some\r\n    into St. Roch's: very few of the enemy seen anywhere to-day. A man was\r\n    shot through the head from St. Roch; would it were destroyed; it\r\n    serves as a secure cover to the rebels.\r\n\r\n    \"26th January, 1776. Eighty loaded sleighs passing towards Menut's.\r\n    Two field-pieces placed at the door; people passing and repassing\r\n    between that house and the General Hospital; some of our shots went\r\n    through Menut's house; we fired a long time at that object; at last we\r\n    perceived a man coming towards the town in a cariole, carrying the old\r\n    signal; he passed their guard-house and waved with his handkerchief;\r\n    we took no notice of him, but fired away at Menut's, he turned about\r\n    and went back. ... Perhaps, they find Menut's too hot for them.--\r\n    (_from Journal of an officer of the Quebec Garrison_, 1775-6,\r\n    quoted in Smith's History of Canada, Vol. II.)\r\n\r\n    \"21st February, 1776. Fired at their guard-house and at Menut's.\r\n\r\n    \"23rd February. About four this morning we heard the enemy's drum at\r\n    Menut's, St. Foix. Sentries saw rockets in the night.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Edward street, St. Roch, and \"Donnacona\" street, near the\r\nUrsulines, the latter thus named about 1840 by the late Rev. Messire\r\nMaguire, then Almoner of the Ursuline Convent, bring up the memory of two\r\nimportant personages of the past, Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, an\r\nEnglish Prince, and Donnacona, a swarthy chief of primitive Canada, who\r\nwelcomed Jacques Cartier.\r\n\r\nThe vanquisher of Montcalm, General Wolfe, is honoured not only by a\r\nstatue, at the corner of Palace and St. John's streets, but again by the\r\nstreet which bears his name, Wolfe street. In like manner, his illustrious\r\nrival Montcalm claims an entire section of the city, \"Montcalm Ward.\" Can\r\nit be that the susceptible young Captain of the _Albemarle_, Horatio\r\nNelson, carried on his flirtation with the captivating Miss Mary Simpson,\r\nin 1782, in the street which now rejoices in his name?\r\n\r\n    _NELSON IN QUEBEC_--1782.\r\n\r\n      \"C'est l'amour qui fait le tour de la ronde.\"--OLD SONG.\r\n\r\n    \"Though the \"Ancient Capital,\" ever since 1764, rejoiced in an organ\r\n    of public opinion--a chronicle of daily events, fashions, city gossip,\r\n    the _Quebec Gazette_,--one would look in vain, in the barren columns\r\n    of that journal, for any intelligence of an incident, in 1782, which,\r\n    from the celebrity in after-life of the chief actor, and the local\r\n    repute of the reigning belle of the day, must have caused a flutter\r\n    among the F. F. Q. of the period. We mean the tender attachment of\r\n    Horatio (Lord) Nelson, commanding H. M. frigate _Albemarle_, 28 guns\r\n    then in port,--his romantic admiration for Miss Mary Simpson, the\r\n    youthful and accomplished daughter of Saunders Simpson (not \"James,\"\r\n    as Dr. Miles asserts), the cousin of James Thompson, Sr., one of\r\n    Wolfe's veterans. Traditions, venerable by their antiquity, told of\r\n    the charms divine, of the conquests of a marvellously handsome Quebec\r\n    beauty in the latter part of the last century: the _Catullus_ of 1783\r\n    thus begins his inspired lay in the _Quebec Gazette_ of that year:\r\n\r\n      'Sure you will rather listen to my call,\r\n      Since beauty and Quebec's fair nymphs I sing.\r\n      Henceforth Diana in Miss S--ps--n see,\r\n      As noble and majestic is her air;\r\n      Nor can fair Venus, W--lc--s, vie with thee,\r\n      Nor all thy heavenly charms with thee compare.'\r\n\r\n    \"It was our fate first to attempt to unravel the tangles of this\r\n    attractive web. In the course of our readings, in 1865, our attention\r\n    had been drawn to a passage in the life of Nelson by the Laureate of\r\n    England, Robert Southey, [132] and enlarged on by Lamartine in the\r\n    pleasant sketch he gave of the naval hero. Our investigations were\r\n    aided by the happy memory of an old friend, now deceased: the late\r\n    Lt.-Col. John Sewell, who had served in the 49th under General Brock,\r\n    and whose birth was nearly contemporary with the visit of Nelson to\r\n    our port in September, 1782. It was evident the chief biographers of\r\n    the gifted sea captain ignored the details of his youthful attachment\r\n    on our shores.\r\n\r\n    \"'At Quebec,' says Southey, 'Nelson became acquainted with Alexander\r\n    Davison, by whose interference he was prevented from making what would\r\n    have been called an imprudent marriage. The _Albemarle_ was about\r\n    to leave the station, her Captain had taken leave of his friends, and\r\n    was gone down the river to the place of anchorage; when the next\r\n    morning, as Davison was walking on the beach, to his surprise he saw\r\n    Nelson coming back in his boat. Upon inquiring the cause of his re-\r\n    appearance, Nelson took his arm to walk towards the town, and told him\r\n    he found it utterly impossible to leave Quebec without again seeing\r\n    the woman whose society contributed so much to his happiness, and then\r\n    and there offering her his hand.' 'If you do,' said his friend, 'your\r\n    utter ruin must inevitably follow.' 'Then, let it follow,' cried\r\n    Nelson; 'for I am resolved to do it.' 'And I,' replied Davison, 'am\r\n    resolved you shall not.' Nelson, however, on this occasion was less\r\n    resolved than his friend, and suffered himself to be led back to the\r\n    boat.'\r\n\r\n    \"This led us to prepare a short 'Novelette' on the subject in the\r\n    _Revue Canadienne_, in 1867, subsequently incorporated in the _Maple\r\n    Leaves_: amended and corrected as new light dawned upon us in the\r\n    _Tourists' Note Book_, issued in 1876, and _Chronicles of the St.\r\n    Lawrence_, published in 1878.\r\n\r\n    \"Whether it was Alexander Davison, his tried friend in afterlife, as\r\n    Southey suggests, or another Quebecer of note, in 1782, Matthew\r\n    Lymburner, as Lt.-Col. John Sewell, on the faith of Hon. William\r\n    Smith, the Historian of Canada, had stated to us, is of minor\r\n    importance: one thing is certain, some thoughtful friend, in 1782,\r\n    seems to have extricated the impulsive Horatio from the 'tangles of\r\n    Neaera's hair' in the port of Quebec: the hand of fate had marked the\r\n    future Captain of the _Victory_, not as the Romeo of a Canadian\r\n    Juliet, but as the paramour of Lady Emma Hamilton. Alas! for his fair\r\n    fame! It seems certain that the Commander of the _Albemarle_,\r\n    during his repeated visits to our port, in July, September and\r\n    October, 1782, became acquainted, possibly at some entertainment at\r\n    Freemason's Hall,--the 'Windsor' of the period--with 'sweet sixteen'\r\n    (he himself was but twenty-four) in the person of Miss Mary Simpson,\r\n    the blooming daughter of an old Highlandman, Sandy Simpson, a cousin\r\n    to Mr. James Thompson, then overseer of works, and father of the late\r\n    Judge John Gwalor Thompson, of Gaspé, and of late Com.-General James\r\n    Thompson, of Quebec. Sandy Simpson was an _habitué_ of this historical\r\n    and, for the period, vast old stone mansion where Captain Miles\r\n    Prentice, [133] as he had been styled in 1775, hung out, with good\r\n    cheer, the olive branch of Freemasonry and of loyalty to his\r\n    Sovereign. The _bonne société_ of Quebec, in 1782, was limited\r\n    indeed: and it was not probable the arrival from sea of one of H.M.'s\r\n    ships of war, the _Albemarle_, could escape the notice of the leading\r\n    men in Quebec.\r\n\r\n    \"If the _Quebec Gazette_ of 1782 and _Quebec Herald_, published in\r\n    1789-90, contain no mention of this incident, several passages in the\r\n    correspondence [134] exchanged by the Thompson family with the early\r\n    love of Nelson, when she had become a stately London matron, as spouse\r\n    of Colonel Matthews, Governor of the Chelsea Hospital, throw light on\r\n    his previous career in Quebec.\r\n\r\n    \"The question as to whether Nelson's charmer was Miss Prentice or her\r\n    cousin, Mary Simpson, which we submitted in the Tourists' Note Book in\r\n    1876 (see pages 26 and 36), we had considered as settled, in 1878, in\r\n    favour of Miss Simpson, as the following passage in the _Chronicles\r\n    of the St. Lawrence_ shows:\r\n\r\n    \"Here anchored (Island of Orleans), it would seem, Nelson's sloop of\r\n    war, the _Albemarle_, in 1782, when the love-sick Horatio returned to\r\n    Quebec, for a last farewell from the blooming Miss Simpson, a daughter\r\n    of Sandy Simpson, one of Wolfe's Provost Marshals. Miss Simpson\r\n    afterwards married Colonel Matthews, Governor of the Chelsea\r\n    Pensioners, and died speaking tenderly of her first love, the hero of\r\n    Trafalgar.' (_Chronicles of the St. Lawrence_, p. 198.)\r\n\r\n    \"This _éclaircissement_, as to dates, is not out of place, inasmuch as\r\n    one of our respected historians, Dr. Hy. Miles, in a scholarly\r\n    article, published March, 1879, three years after our mentioning Miss\r\n    Simpson, labours under the idea he was the first to give her name in\r\n    connection with Lord Nelson. Several inaccuracies occur in his\r\n    interesting essay. Miss Simpson is styled the daughter of 'James'\r\n    Simpson, whereas she was the daughter of Saunders Simpson, a cousin of\r\n    James Thompson, who had married a niece of Miles Prentice. In a foot\r\n    note appended to his essay the Doctor states that 'just before the\r\n    departure of our late popular Governor-General (Lord Dufferin), at a\r\n    breakfast at the Citadel, where His Excellency entertained the\r\n    Captains of the British war vessels _Bellerophon_ and _Sirius_ (he\r\n    means the _Argus_ and the _Sirius_), then in port, at which we were\r\n    present, the conversation having turned on former visits of commanders\r\n    of ships-of-war, when, Nelson's name being brought up, the Earl\r\n    remarked that Mr. LeMoine (then present) was able to afford some\r\n    information about him.' 'Mr. LeMoine,' adds Dr. Miles, 'at His\r\n    Excellency's request, related what he had previously written, much to\r\n    the satisfaction of his hearers.' Mr. LeMoine's account of the affair,\r\n    however, as it is based on the now exploded doctrine that the heroine\r\n    was one of the nieces of Mrs. Miles Prentice, was not, as has been\r\n    shown in the foregoing article, the correct one, however gratifying to\r\n    the distinguished listeners to its recital on that occasion.'\r\n\r\n    \"As the correctness of the information we were asked to impart on this\r\n    occasion is impugned by the learned historian, we will, we hope, be\r\n    pardoned for setting this point at rest. Dr. Miles has committed some\r\n    egregious, though no doubt unintentional, error. The publication in\r\n    our _Tourist's Note Book_, in 1876, of the name of Miss Simpson,\r\n    in connection with Captain Nelson, three years before the appearance\r\n    of Dr. Miles' essay, which was published in March, 1879, and its\r\n    repetition, as previously shown, in the _Chronicles of the St.\r\n    Lawrence_, issued in the beginning of the year 1878, can leave no\r\n    doubt as to our knowledge of this incident, and disposes of the\r\n    Doctor's statement. The name furnished by us was that of Miss Simpson,\r\n    and no other. The breakfast in question took place on the 18th\r\n    October, 1878: there were present Lord Dufferin, Mrs. Russell\r\n    Stephenson, Mrs. J. T. Harrower, Very Rev. Dean Stanley, the Commander\r\n    of H.M.S. the _Sirius_, Capt. Sullivan, the Captain of H.M.S. the\r\n    _Argus_, Capt. Hamilton, A.D.C., and the writer.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral streets in the St. Louis, St. John and St. Roch suburbs bear the\r\nnames of eminent citizens who have, at different periods, made a free gift\r\nof the sites, or who, by their public spirit, have left behind them a\r\ncherished memory among the people, such as Berthelot, Massue, Boisseau,\r\nD'Artigny, Grey, Stewart, Lee, Buteau, Hudon, Smith, Salaberry, Scott,\r\nTourangeau, Pozer [135], Panet, Bell, Robitaille, Ryland [136], St. Ours\r\n[137], Dambourgès [138]. Laval, Panet, Plessis, Séguin, Turgeon streets\r\nperpetuate the names of eminent Roman Catholic Bishops. Jerome street took\r\nthis name from one of the ablest preceptors of youth the Quebec Seminary\r\never had--Messire Jerome Demers.\r\n\r\n\"Dorchester\" Bridge was constructed in 1822, and took the place of the\r\nformer bridge (Vieux Pont), on the street to the west, built by Asa Porter\r\nin 1789, and called after Lord Dorchester the saviour of Quebec. Saint\r\nJoseph street, St. Roch, was named after the eminent Roman Catholic\r\nprelate, Mgr. Joseph Octave Plessis, Bishop of Quebec, who, in 1811, built\r\nthe church of St. Roch's suburbs, on land donated by a Presbyterian\r\ngentleman, John Mure, and dedicated it to St. Joseph, the patron saint of\r\nCanada. At one period it had a width of only twenty-five feet, and was\r\nwidened to the extent of forty, through the liberality of certain persons.\r\nFrom the circumstance, the corporation was induced to continue it beyond\r\nthe city limits up to the road which leads to Lorette, thereby rendering\r\nit the most useful and one of the handsomest streets of St. Roch.\r\n\r\nAt what period did the most spacious highway of the ward (\"Crown\" street,\r\nsixty feet in width), receive its baptismal name? Most assuredly it was\r\nprevious to 1837, the democratic era of Papineau. \"King\" street, no doubt,\r\nrecalls the reign of George III. So also does \"Queen\" street recall his\r\nroyal Consort. The locality seems eminently favourable to monarchical\r\nbelongings, to the House of Hanover in particular, judging from the names\r\nof several of its highways: _Crown, King, Queen, Victoria, Albert, Prince\r\nof Wales, Alfred, Arthur, Prince Edward,_ &c.\r\n\r\nTowards the year 1815, the late Honorable John Richardson, of Montreal,\r\nconferred his name on the street which intersects the grounds which Sir\r\nJames Craig had, on the 15th March, 1811, conceded to him as Curator to\r\nthe vacant estate of the late Hon. William Grant, [139] whose name is\r\nlikewise bequeathed to a street adjacent, Grant street, while his lady, La\r\nBaronne de Longueuil, is remembered in the adjoining thoroughfare which\r\nintersects it. A Mr. Henderson, [140] about the commencement of the\r\npresent century, possessed grounds in the vicinity of the present Gas\r\nWorks, hence we have \"Henderson\" street. The Gas Company's wharf is built\r\non the site of the old jetty of which we have seen mention made, about\r\n1720. This long pier was composed of large boulders heaped one upon the\r\nother, and served the purpose of sheltering the landing place at the\r\nPalais harbour from the north-east winds. In 1750, Colonel Bouchette says,\r\nit served as a public promenade, and was covered by a public platform.\r\n\r\nRamsay street, parallel with Henderson street, leads from St. Paul street\r\nto Orleans Place, _Place d'Orléans_, recalling the Bourbon era, prior\r\nto 1759, and also the last French Commander of Quebec, Jean Bte. Nicholas\r\nRoche deRamezay. The historic Château deRamezay, on Notre Dame street,\r\nMontreal, now threatened with destruction, attests the sojourn in New\r\nFrance of a scion of the proud old Scotch house of Ramsay.--(_Montreal\r\nGazette, 3rd Feb._, 1881.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARBOUR DOCKS\r\n\r\nOne of the most active promoters of this hopeful scheme, in recent times,\r\nwas the Hon. Mr. Justice C. J. Tessier, when a member of the Corporation\r\nabout 1850. A plan of the Harbour Works which he suggested was submitted\r\nto the Council. Nothing, however, was then done. The Legislature\r\neventually assigned the work to the Harbour Commission Trust. The dredging\r\ncommenced on May 2nd, 1877.\r\n\r\n    \"The progress made with our Harbour Improvements, year by year, forms\r\n    part of the history of our times, so far, at least, as the annals of\r\n    this most ancient city of Quebec are concerned. The first stone of the\r\n    Graving Dock at Levis was laid on Monday, the 7th June, 1880, by His\r\n    Excellency the Governor-General, and the tablet stone, with the name\r\n    of \"Louise\" graven on it, on Thursday, the 29th of July. Thenceforth\r\n    the Harbour Works in the River St. Charles became \"The Princess Louise\r\n    Embankment and Docks,\" and the work in progress on the Levis or south\r\n    side of the St. Lawrence \"The Lorne Graving Dock,\" thus naming the\r\n    entrance approaches to our cliff-bound city after our present popular\r\n    Vice-Regal rulers.\"\r\n\r\nTo the address presented to His Excellency the Governor-General on this\r\noccasion, the following reply was made:--\r\n\r\n    MR. PRESIDENT AND GENTLEMEN OF THE BOARD OF THE QUEBEC HARBOUR\r\n    COMMISSIONERS,--It is with a full sympathy for you in the hopes which\r\n    have guided you to the construction of this great work that the\r\n    Princess comes to-day to lay this stone, commemorating an important\r\n    stage in the completion of your labours. She desires that her name,\r\n    graven on this wall, shall serve to remind your citizens, as well as\r\n    all who profit by the excellence of the accommodation here given to\r\n    vessels of great burden, of her interest in your fortunes, and of her\r\n    association with you in the speeding of an undertaking designed to\r\n    benefit at once a great port of the new world and many of the\r\n    communities of Europe.\r\n\r\n    Access to Quebec is easy now to the largest ocean-going vessels. Tour\r\n    city has the railways far advanced, which will pierce to the heart of\r\n    the granary of the world--the great wheat centres of the Canadian\r\n    North-West. The very might and grandeur of the stream on which Quebec\r\n    is built is in her favour as compared with other centres of commerce,\r\n    for her visitors have but little tax to pay when a favouring wind\r\n    fails them, while steam must be employed against the strong currents\r\n    of the upper river.\r\n\r\n    The gigantic quays and the feeding lines of rail stretching inwards\r\n    unbroken to the prairies must, in all human probability, in the\r\n    future, ensure to the ancient capital a place among the most\r\n    flourishing cities of the continent. Even without the aid which\r\n    science is now bringing to her support look at the strides which have\r\n    been made in her prosperity within the last century. Old pictures will\r\n    show you the hillside above us bare of all but the houses necessary\r\n    for the garrison of a fortress, whose hard fate it had been to be the\r\n    place of contention of rival armies, while beneath the ramparts or\r\n    within their walls were to be seen only a few of the buildings now\r\n    devoted in far greater numbers to the purposes of religion and of\r\n    charity. The banks of the St. Charles possessed then only a few store-\r\n    houses such as would not now be thought sufficient for one of our\r\n    fifth-rate towns. Now the whole of the slope is covered by the homes\r\n    of a thriving, increasing and industrious population, while, over the\r\n    extending limits under the rule of the municipality, learning looks\r\n    down from the stately walls of Laval, and the members elected by your\r\n    free and noble province will pass the laws, whose validity is\r\n    guaranteed by our federal constitution, in a palace reminding one of\r\n    the stately fabric which holds the art treasures of France. None can\r\n    observe the contrast without seeing that your progress, although it\r\n    has partaken of no magic or mushroom-like growth, has been most marked\r\n    and promising.\r\n\r\n    If commerce seeks for her abode the head of navigation, there are many\r\n    instances to show that she loves also to keep her ships to their\r\n    native tides. An instance well known to us may be cited in the case of\r\n    Glasgow and of Greenock, cities which have risen to their present\r\n    prosperity so quickly that they rival in that respect many in America\r\n    and in Canada. Greenock has not been killed by the enormous rise in\r\n    the importance of the commercial capital of Scotland. Assuredly we may\r\n    believe that Quebec, with a far greater country at its back, may be\r\n    enabled, with the aid of proper communications, to pour forth every\r\n    summer from her lap much of our wealth, of which Europe is so eager to\r\n    partake.\r\n\r\n    These are the aspirations we share with you, and we wish to give\r\n    effect to them by drawing the attention of those beyond the seas to\r\n    the practical invitation you extend to them by the facilities afforded\r\n    by your docks and wharves, and we now join with you in the trust that\r\n    ample repayment will be yours for the energy and engineering skill you\r\n    have lavished on the public works, which are comparable to any\r\n    designed for a similar purpose.\r\n                                                         LORNE.\r\n\r\n    The drapery by which it had been concealed having been removed, the\r\n    tablet stone was discovered suspended over the place it was intended\r\n    to occupy in the wall. The attendant masons having performed their\r\n    part, a silver trowel was handed to the Princess. This was a handsome\r\n    piece of workmanship, beautifully chased and set in a rosewood handle,\r\n    and bore the following inscription:--\"To H.R.H. Princess Louise, this\r\n    trowel was presented by the contractors of the Quebec Harbour Works,\r\n    on the occasion of her laying the tablet stone of the Princess Louise\r\n    Embankment and Docks, River St. Charles, Quebec July 29, 1880.\" Her\r\n    Royal Highness, with this splendid implement, dug right lustily into\r\n    the cement, and having prepared the bed, drew back to allow the\r\n    ponderous stone to be lowered thereinto. This done, a beautiful mallet\r\n    of polished oak having been presented, the mass received two or three\r\n    blows, and was then declared to be well and truly laid. The Vice-Regal\r\n    party almost immediately afterwards regained the _Druid_, which\r\n    swiftly conveyed the members thereof to _terra firma_, the police\r\n    yacht _Dolphin_ being in attendance. Of the other steamers, the\r\n    _Clyde_ and _North_, after a short sail round the harbour, landed\r\n    their passengers at the Grand Trunk Railway wharf; the _Brothers_ went\r\n    down to St. Joseph, and gave to those on board an opportunity of\r\n    noticing the progress made upon the new Graving Dock there. The troops\r\n    and privileged guests having been conveyed to and from the scene by\r\n    the Montreal Harbour Commissioners' boat _John Young_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_HARBOUR AND DOCK WORKS._\r\n\r\nBefore describing these vast and important structures, calculated to\r\nafford such boundless facilities to ocean shipping frequenting our port,\r\nit may not be without interest to note the efforts made at various times\r\nfor their construction. In his excellent work, \"_British Dominions in\r\nNorth America_,\" Vol. 1., p. 263-264, Col. Bouchette thus deals with\r\nthe subject in 1832--the far-seeing but misunderstood Mr. James George,\r\nhowever, as early as 1822, had conceived in his teeming brain the whole\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\"The construction of a pier across the estuary of the St. Charles is a\r\nmeasure of the greatest practicability, and of pronounced importance in\r\nevery aspect, and a subject that was brought under the notice of the\r\nLegislature in 1829, when it received the most serious consideration of\r\nthe committee, and was very favourably reported upon; but no bill has yet\r\n(1832) been introduced tending to encourage so momentous an undertaking.\r\nThe most judicious position contemplated for the erection of such a pier\r\nis decidedly between the New Exchange and the Beauport Distillery and\r\nMills, [141] a direct distance of 4,300 yards, which, with the exception\r\nmerely of the channels of the St. Charles (that are neither very broad nor\r\ndeep nor numerous), is dry at low water, and affords every advantage\r\ncalculated to facilitate the construction of a work of that nature. It\r\nappears that, anterior to the conquest, the French Government had\r\nentertained some views in relation to so great an amelioration; but the\r\nsubject seems to have never been properly taken up until 1822, when the\r\nproject was submitted to the Governor-in-Chief of the Province by James\r\nGeorge, Esq., a Quebec merchant, conspicuous for his zeal and activity, as\r\nwell in promoting this particular object as in forwarding the views of the\r\nSt. Lawrence Company, an association formed avowedly for the improvement\r\nof the navigation of the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nOf the benefits to be derived from thus docking the St. Charles no one can\r\ndoubt, whether the undertaking be considered in a local, municipal or\r\ncommercial point of view. As a means of extending the boundaries of the\r\nLower Town, and bringing under more immediate improvement the extensive\r\nbranches of the St. Charles, it is of the greatest consequence.\r\n\r\nCommercially considered, this pier (which would at first form a _tide-\r\ndock_, that might eventually be converted into a _wet-dock_) would\r\nbe of incalculable advantage from the great facilities it would offer to\r\nthe general trade of the place, and especially the timber trade, which has\r\nfrequently involved its members in much perplexity, owing to the\r\ndeficiency that exists of some secure dock or other similar reservoir\r\nwhere that staple article of the colony might be safely kept, and where\r\nships might take in their cargoes without being exposed to the numerous\r\ndifficulties and momentous losses often sustained in loading at moorings\r\nin the coves or in harbour. By building the outward face of the pier in\r\ndeep water, or projecting wharves from it, an important advantage would\r\nalso be gained, affording increased conveniences in the unloading and\r\nloading of vessels. In fact, it would be impossible, in summarily noticing\r\nthe beneficial tendency of this great work, to particularize its manifold\r\nadvantages; they are too weighty to be overlooked, either by the\r\nLegislature or the community at large, and will doubtless dictate the\r\nexpediency of bringing them into effectual operation. The different modes\r\nsuggested of raising the capital required for the undertaking are: 1st.\r\nFrom the Provincial revenue by the annual rate of a loan; 2nd. By an Act\r\nvesting it in the City of Quebec, by way of loan to the city, to be\r\nrefunded by the receipts of rents and dock dues arising from the work;\r\n3rd. By an Act of Incorporation, the Province taking a share in the stock,\r\nand appointing commissioners; 4th. By an Act of Incorporation only.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wet-Dock quay wall was to have been completed by the 1st of October,\r\n1880, but delays have taken place, and the much-desired Tide Harbor of 20\r\nacres, entering from the St. Lawrence, with a depth of 24 feet at low\r\nwater, together with a Dock of 40 acres, having a permanent depth of 27\r\nfeet, will require another year before it is finally completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_GRAVING DOCK, LEVIS._\r\n\r\nAn important portion of our Harbour improvements are located on the\r\nopposite shore of the St. Lawrence at Levis, and the sums voted by the\r\nParliament of Canada (38 Vic., chap. 56), or granted by the Imperial\r\nGovernment to construct a graving dock in the Harbour of Quebec, were used\r\nin this structure, located by Order-in-Council, dated May, 1877, at St.\r\nJoseph de Lévis.\r\n\r\n    \"The dimensions of the dock are:\r\n    Length............................. 500   feet\r\n    Extreme width...................... 100    \"\r\n    Depth.............................. 25.5   \"\r\n    Width of entrance.................. 62     \"\r\n\r\n    \"The designs and specifications were prepared by Messrs. Kinnipple &\r\n    Morris, Engineers, Westminster and Greenock.\r\n\r\n    \"The Graving Dock of St. Joseph de Lévis, Parish of Lauzon, Quebec,\r\n    was commenced by the Quebec Harbour Commissioners, under the Resident\r\n    Engineer, Woodford Pilkington, M.I., C.E. in November, 1877, and was\r\n    carried on previous to tenders being invited for the present contract,\r\n    to the month of March, 1878, during which time the sum of $6,298.20\r\n    was expended in excavation on the site of the Dock, which work was\r\n    afterwards taken over by Messrs. Larkin, Connolly & Co., as an\r\n    executed part of their contract, signed August 17th, 1878, and the\r\n    above sum deducted from the contract amount of their tender for the\r\n    excavations given in the bills of quantities under this head; the\r\n    Harbour Commissioners being afterwards re-credited with this amount of\r\n    expenditure under the first certificate.\r\n\r\n    The work of excavating for and building this Graving Dock was taken in\r\n    hand under contract with the Quebec Harbour Commissioners, by Messrs.\r\n    Larkin, Connolly & Co., on the 17th August, 1878, for the lump sum of\r\n    $330,953.89. The works to be delivered over to the Quebec Harbour\r\n    Commissioners, finished complete, on the 1st day of June, 1882. [142]\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE GATES OF QUEBEC._\r\n\r\nIt seems superfluous to furnish a detailed description of the\r\nfortifications and citadel of Quebec. After the lengthy account given in\r\n\"Quebec, Past and Present,\" pages 348-60, the following sketch, which we\r\nborrow, written previous to the erection of the new St. Louis and Kent\r\nGates, [143] corrected to date, throws additional light on this part of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n    \"Of all the historic monuments connecting modern Quebec with its\r\n    eventful and heroic past, none have deservedly held a higher place in\r\n    the estimation of the antiquarian, the scholar and the curious\r\n    stranger than the former gates of the renowned fortress. These relics\r\n    of a by-gone age, with their massive proportions and grim, medieval\r\n    architecture, no longer exist, however, to carry the mind back to the\r\n    days which invest the oldest city in North America with its peculiar\r\n    interest and attraction. Nothing now remains to show where they once\r\n    raised their formidable barriers to the foe or opened their hospitable\r\n    portals to friends, but graceful substitutes of modern construction or\r\n    yawning apertures in the line of circumvallation, where until 1871\r\n    stood Prescott and Hope Gates which represented the later defences of\r\n    the place erected under British rule. Of the three gates--St. Louis,\r\n    St. John and Palace--which originally pierced the fortifications of\r\n    Quebec under French dominion, the last vestige disappeared many years\r\n    ago. The structures with which they were replaced, together with the\r\n    two additional and similarly guarded openings--Hope and Prescott\r\n    gates--provided for the public convenience or military requirements by\r\n    the British Government since the Conquest, have experienced the same\r\n    fate within the last decade to gratify what are known as modern ideas\r\n    of progress and improvement--vandalism would, perhaps, be the better\r\n    term. No desecrating hand, however, can rob those hallowed links, in\r\n    the chain of recollection, of the glorious memories which cluster\r\n    around them so thickly. Time and obliteration itself have wrought no\r\n    diminution of regard for their cherished associations.\r\n\r\n    To each one of them an undying history attaches, and even their vacant\r\n    sites appeal with mute, but surpassing eloquence to the sympathy, the\r\n    interest and the veneration of visitors, to whom Quebec will be ever\r\n    dear, not for what it is, but for what it has been. To the quick\r\n    comprehension of Lord Dufferin, it remained to note the inestimable\r\n    value of such heirlooms to the world at large. To his happy tact we\r\n    owe the revival of even a local concern for their preservation; and to\r\n    his fertile mind and aesthetic taste, we are indebted for the\r\n    conception of the noble scheme of restoration, embellishment and\r\n    addition in harmony with local requirements and modern notions of\r\n    progress, which is now being realized to keep their memories intact\r\n    for succeeding generations and retain for the cradle of New France its\r\n    unique reputation as the famous walled city of the New World. It has\r\n    more than once been remarked by tourists that, in their peculiar\r\n    fondness for a religious nomenclature, the early French settlers of\r\n    Quebec must have exhausted the saintly calendar in adapting names to\r\n    their public highways, places and institutions. To this pardonable\r\n    trait in their character, we must unquestionably ascribe the names\r\n    given to two of the three original gates in their primitive lines of\r\n    defence--St. Louis and St. John's gates--names which they were allowed\r\n    to retain when the Gallic lilies drooped before the victorious flag of\r\n    Britain. The erection of the original St. Louis gate undoubtedly dates\r\n    back as far as 1694. Authentic records prove this fact beyond\r\n    question; but it is not quite so clear what part this gate played in\r\n    subsequent history down to the time of the conquest, thought it may be\r\n    fairly presumed that it rendered important services in connection\r\n    especially with the many harassing attacks of the Iroquois tribes in\r\n    the constant wars which were waged in the early days of the infant\r\n    colony with those formidable and savage foes of the French. One thing\r\n    is certain, however, that it was one of the gates by which a portion\r\n    of Montcalm's army, after its defeat on the Plains of Abraham, passed\r\n    into the city on its way back, _via_ Palace gate and the bridge\r\n    of boats over the St. Charles, to the Beauport camp. In 1791, after\r\n    Quebec had fallen into British hands, St. Louis gate was reported to\r\n    be in a ruinous condition, and it became necessary to raze it to the\r\n    ground and rebuild it. Between this date and 1823, it appears to have\r\n    undergone several changes; but, in the latter year, as part of the\r\n    plan of defence, including the Citadel, adopted by the Duke of\r\n    Wellington, and carried out at an enormous cost by England, it was\r\n    replaced by another structure, retaining the same name. About this\r\n    time seem to have been also constructed the singularly tortuous\r\n    outward approaches to this opening in the western wall of the city,\r\n    which were eventually so inconvenient to traffic in peaceful days, of\r\n    whatever value they might have been from a military stand-point in\r\n    trying hours half-a-century ago. These were also removed with the gate\r\n    itself in 1871. On the vacant site of the latter, in accordance with\r\n    Lord Dufferin's improvment project, a magnificent memorial gate, which\r\n    the citizens had unanimously agreed to call \"The Dufferin gate,\" is\r\n    now (1880) erected.\r\n\r\n    The intention of naming it \"The Dufferin gate,\" however, was\r\n    abandoned. H.R.H. the Princess Louise, in deference to its traditions\r\n    and with a graceful appreciation of the feelings of the French element\r\n    of the population, having recently expressed the desire that it should\r\n    be allowed to retain its original appellation.\r\n\r\n    Before their departure from Canada, Lord and Lady Dufferin had the\r\n    pleasure of assisting at the ceremony of laying the corner stone of\r\n    this new gate, as well as of the new terrace, which bears their name,\r\n    and of fairly starting those important works on the high road to\r\n    realization.\r\n\r\n    As an interesting link between the present and the past, St. John's\r\n    gate holds an equally prominent rank and claims an equal antiquity\r\n    with St. Louis gate. Its erection as one of the original gates of the\r\n    French fortress dates from the same year and its history is very much\r\n    the same. Through it another portion of Montcalm's defeated forces\r\n    found their way behind the shelter of the defences after the fatal day\r\n    of the Plains of Abraham. Like St. Louis gate, too, it was pulled down\r\n    on account of its ruinous condition in 1791 and subsequently rebuilt\r\n    by the British Government in the form in which it endured until 1865,\r\n    when it was demolished and replaced, at an expense of some $40,000 to\r\n    the city, by its present more ornate and convenient substitute, to\r\n    meet the increased requirements of traffic over the great artery of\r\n    the upper levels--St. John street. St. John's gate was one of the\r\n    objective points included in the American plan of assault upon Quebec\r\n    on the memorable 31st December, 1775; Col. Livingston, with a regiment\r\n    of insurgent Canadians, and Major Brown, with part of a regiment from\r\n    Boston, having been detailed to make a false attack upon the walls to\r\n    the south of it and to set fire to the gate itself with combustibles\r\n    prepared for that purpose--a scheme in which the assailants were\r\n    foiled by the depth of snow and other obstacles. This gate, being of\r\n    quite recent construction and of massive, as well as passably\r\n    handsome, appearance, is not included in the general scheme of\r\n    improvement. The erection of a life-size statue of Samuel Champlain,\r\n    the founder of Quebec, upon its summit, is, however, talked of.\r\n\r\n    Palace or the Palais gate is the third and last of the old French\r\n    portals of the city, and derives its title from the fact that the\r\n    highway which passed through it led to the palace or residence of the\r\n    Intendants of New France, which has also given its name to the present\r\n    quarter of the city lying beneath the cliff on the northern face of\r\n    the fortress, where its crumbling ruins are still visible in the\r\n    immediate neighborhood of the passenger terminus of the North Shore\r\n    Railway. Erected under French rule, during which it is believed to\r\n    have been the most fashionable and the most used, it bade a final\r\n    farewell to the last of its gallant, but unfortunate French defenders,\r\n    and to that imperial power which, for more than one hundred and fifty\r\n    years, had swayed the colonial destinies of the Canadas and contested\r\n    inch by inch with England, the supremacy of the New World, when a\r\n    portion of Montcalm's defeated troops passed out beneath its darkening\r\n    shadows on the fatal 13th September, 1759. After the capitulation of\r\n    Quebec, General Murray devoted himself at once to the work of\r\n    strengthening the defences of the city, and the attention in this\r\n    respect paid to Palace gate appears to have stood him in good stead\r\n    during the following year's campaign, when the British invaders,\r\n    defeated in the battle of St. Foye, were compelled to take shelter\r\n    behind the walls of the town and sustain a short siege at the Hands of\r\n    the victorious French under deLévis. In 1791, the old French\r\n    structure, now a decayed ruin, was razed by the English, but, in the\r\n    meanwhile, during 1775, it had gallantly withstood the assaults and\r\n    siege of the American invaders under Montgomery and Benedict Arnold.\r\n    The somewhat ornate substitute, by which it was replaced is said to\r\n    have resembled one of the gates of Pompeii, and seems to have been\r\n    erected as late as the year 1830 or 1831, as, in the course of its\r\n    demolition, in 1874, an inscription was laid bare, attesting the fact\r\n    that at least the timbers and planking had been put up by local\r\n    workmen in 1831. It is not intended to rebuild this gate under the\r\n    Dufferin plan, on account of the great volume of traffic, more\r\n    especially since the completion of the North Shore Railway, to whose\r\n    terminus the roadway which leads over its site is the most direct\r\n    route. To mark that memorable spot, however, it is intended to flank\r\n    it on either side with picturesque Norman turrets rising above the\r\n    line of the fortification wall.\r\n\r\n    Hope Gate, also on the northern face of the ramparts, was the first of\r\n    the two purely British gates of Quebec, and was erected in 1786 by\r\n    Colonel Henry Hope, Commandant of the Forces and Administrator of the\r\n    Province, from whom it takes its name. It was demolished in 1874 for\r\n    no especial reason, this gate being no obstacle whatever to the\r\n    growing requirements of traffic, as will be readily understood from\r\n    its situation. Like Palace Gate, too, it is not to be rebuilt--its\r\n    approaches being easily commanded and its position on the rugged,\r\n    lofty cliff being naturally very strong.\r\n\r\n    Its site, however, will be marked in the carrying out of the Dufferin\r\n    Improvements by flanking Norman turrets.\r\n\r\n    The last of the city gates proper, wholly of British origin, but the\r\n    first that grimly confronted in by-gone days the visitor approaching\r\n    the city from the water-side and entering the fortress, is, or rather\r\n    was, Prescott Gate, which commanded the steep approach known as\r\n    Mountain Hill. This gate, which was more commonly known as the Lower\r\n    Town gate, because it led to that part--the oldest--of the city known\r\n    by that name, was erected in 1797, (to replace a rough structure of\r\n    pickets which existed at this point from the time of the siege by the\r\n    Americans in 1775) by General Robert Prescott, who served in America\r\n    during the revolutionary war, and, after further service in the West\r\n    Indies, succeeded Lord Dorchester as the British Governor-General in\r\n    Lower Canada in 1796, dying in 1815, at the age of 89 years, and\r\n    giving his name to this memento of his administration, as well as to\r\n    Prescott, Ontario. Old Prescott Gate was unquestionably a great public\r\n    nuisance in times of peace, its demolition, in 1871, consequently\r\n    provoked the least regret of all in connection with the obliteration\r\n    of those curious relics of Quebec's historic past. For reasons, which\r\n    are obvious, it would be impossible to replace Prescott Gate with any\r\n    structure of a like character, without impeding seriously the flow of\r\n    traffic by way of such a leading artery as Mountain Hill. It will,\r\n    however, be replaced by a light and handsome iron bridge of a single\r\n    span over the roadway with flanking Norman turrets.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _KENT GATE._\r\n\r\n    For the information of our visitors and strangers generally, we may\r\n    explain that, a few years since, the western fortification wall\r\n    between St. John's gate and the military exercising ground in past\r\n    years, known as the Esplanade, was cut through to form a roadway\r\n    communicating between the higher levels of the Upper Town and the St.\r\n    Louis suburbs, now styled Montcalm Ward.\r\n\r\n    It consequently became necessary, in keeping with the aesthetic spirit\r\n    of the whole Dufferin scheme, to fill up in some way this unsightly\r\n    gap without interfering with the traffic. It was finally decided to\r\n    erect here one of the proposed memorial gates, which is altogether\r\n    therefore an addition to the number of the existing gates or their\r\n    intended substitutes. This edifice, has been designed to do homage to\r\n    the memory of Edward, Duke of Kent, the father of Queen Victoria. This\r\n    gate will be the most imposing of all in the entire circuit of the\r\n    fortifications, while it has had the signal honour of further being\r\n    reserved for a handsome subscription towards its cost from Her\r\n    Majesty's privy purse and dedication at the hands of H. R. H. the\r\n    Princess, who laid its corner stone with appropriate ceremonial during\r\n    the month of June, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THE CITADEL GATES._\r\n\r\n    Besides the foregoing, however, the fortress possesses in reality two\r\n    other gates of much interest to the stranger. When the famous Citadel,\r\n    commanding the entire harbour and surrounding country, was constructed\r\n    on Cape Diamond, the number of existing gates was increased from five\r\n    to seven by the erection of the Chain and Dalhousie, or Citadel gates,\r\n    leading to that great fortalice of British power, which may be aptly\r\n    styled the _summum opus_ of the magnificent but costly system of\r\n    strategic works that has earned for Quebec its title of the Gibraltar\r\n    of America. But, as these belong to the Citadel, which is an\r\n    independent stronghold of itself, rather than to the defensive works\r\n    of the city proper, it suffices to mention that they were erected\r\n    under the administration of the Earl of Dalhousie, in 1827, and that\r\n    they are well worthy of a visit of inspection--the one being a\r\n    handsome and formidable barrier of its class and the other of very\r\n    massive construction and considerable depth.\r\n\r\n    The proposed Château St. Louis or Castle of St. Louis, must be\r\n    regarded as the crowning feature of the Dufferin scheme of\r\n    embellishment and was designed by the late Governor General to serve\r\n    as a vice-regal residence during the sojourn of the representative of\r\n    the Crown in Quebec, as well as to revive the historic splendors of\r\n    the ancient pile of that name, which formed the abode of the early\r\n    Governors of New France. Of course, this noble structure only exists\r\n    as yet on paper; but, should it ever be erected, it will be a striking\r\n    object from any point whence the Citadel is visible as it will rise to\r\n    a considerable height above its highest battlements, standing out in\r\n    bold relief to the east of the building known as the Officers'\r\n    Quarters, with a frontage of 200 feet, and an elevation partly of 60\r\n    and partly of 100 feet, with a basement, two main stories, and mansard\r\n    roof and two towers of different heights, but of equally charming\r\n    design--the style of architecture of the whole being an agreeable\r\n    _mélange_ of the picturesque Norman and Elizabethan.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THELLER AND DODGE'S ESCAPE FROM THE CITADEL._\r\n\r\n    The Citadel has been described in detail elsewhere; [144] it is,\r\n    therefore, unnecessary to allude to it further than recording here a\r\n    startling episode in which it played a conspicuous part in those days\r\n    of foes and alarm, during the Insurrection of 1838:--\r\n\r\n        \"After the affair of St. Denis,\" says Roger, [145] \"the murder of\r\n        Lieutenant Weir, the matter of St. Charles, the storm and capture\r\n        of the Church of St. Eustache, and the battle of Toronto, there\r\n        were filibustering attempts to invade Canada, neither recognized\r\n        by the Government of the United States nor by the bulk of the\r\n        people, but indulged in by a party, sentimental with regard to\r\n        liberty, and by others to whom plunder and excitement were\r\n        congenial. In one of these filibustering expeditions, 'General'\r\n        Sutherland, 'Brigadier General' Theller, Colonel Dodge, Messrs.\r\n        Brophy, Thayer and other residents, if not citizens, of the United\r\n        States, sailed from Detroit in the schooner _Anne_ for Bois\r\n        Blanc, which having been seized, an attack was made on Fort Maiden\r\n        on the 8th of January, 1838, terminating in the capture of\r\n        Theller, Dodge, Brophy and some others; General Sutherland having\r\n        been afterwards captured on the ice, at the mouth of the River\r\n        Detroit, by Colonel John Prince, of the Canadian Militia. The\r\n        prisoners, after having been for a time in gaol at Toronto, were\r\n        transferred, some to Fort Henry, at Kingston, and others, among\r\n        whom were Sutherland, Theller and Dodge, to the Citadel of Quebec,\r\n        which was then occupied by a battalion of the Guards, and there\r\n        imprisoned, but treated with consideration and courtesy. It was\r\n        not, however, unnatural that they should endeavor to escape. They\r\n        were taken out of their prison-house daily for an airing, in\r\n        charge of a guard, and, as it would appear, were not altogether\r\n        denied the opportunity of conversing with persons who were\r\n        friendly to them. Theller, in an account of the Rebellion in\r\n        Canada, edited, it is said, by General Roberts, of Detroit,\r\n        himself minutely details the nature and manner of his intercourse\r\n        with a Mr. P. S. Grace, while under the charge of the military in\r\n        Cape Diamond; how he succeeded in bribing soldiers' wives, and in\r\n        cultivating the friendship of officers, non-commissioned officers\r\n        and men of the Guards, much of which is exaggerated, and some of\r\n        which is untrue. Some of the sergeants, for small presents,\r\n        Theller asserts, did whatever he required in the way of bringing\r\n        books and newspapers from town and articles of food and drink from\r\n        the canteen, which is undoubtedly true, but no man in the\r\n        regiment, either directly or indirectly, connived at the escape.\r\n        It was the result of clever management on the part of Theller,\r\n        Dodge and his companions, and of unsuspecting stupidity on the\r\n        part of the sentry who guarded the door of the prison, and,\r\n        indeed, of all who seemed to have had intercourse with the\r\n        prisoners. The escape was thus effected:--On a dark, rainy night,\r\n        late in October, 1838, an iron bar having been previously cut\r\n        through with a file given them from without, the sawing having\r\n        been effected during performances on the shrill fife of one of the\r\n        fifers of the garrison, which a prisoner had borrowed for the\r\n        purpose of passing away the time and keeping up the spirits of his\r\n        companions in misfortune, some of whom were despondent, Theller's\r\n        conversation seduced a sentry into conversation, next to smoke a\r\n        pipe, then to drink a tumbler of London porter, drugged with\r\n        rathermore than 'three times sixty drops' of laudanum. The sentry\r\n        struggled hard to prevent the drowsiness that was stealing over\r\n        him; he spoke thick, and muttered that he had never before drank\r\n        anything so good or so strong. He walked about in the rain to keep\r\n        himself awake, and staggered a little. * * * It resulted in the\r\n        escape of Dodge, Thayer, Theller and Partridge, who, after several\r\n        hair-breadth escapes and hazardous incidents, found themselves\r\n        outside of their old quarters.\" \"The escaping party,\" adds Roger,\r\n        \"moved cautiously forward, at respectable distances from each\r\n        other, along the canteen, and then got out into the middle of the\r\n        great square to elude the sentry at the magazine. While there a\r\n        sergeant came rushing from the guard-room towards the officers'\r\n        quarters, the red, or as they appeared dark, stripes being visible\r\n        on a white undress jacket. It seemed to be an alarm. There were\r\n        only three sentinels between the escaping party and the flagstaff,\r\n        where the descent was intended. Abreast was one whose duty was to\r\n        guard the back part of the magazine and a pile of firewood which\r\n        was there corded up, and also to prevent soldiers from going to\r\n        the canteen. Another stood opposite the door of the officers'\r\n        mess-room. There was room enough in the darkness to pass these\r\n        sentinels, and Theller and his companions no longer crawled, but\r\n        walked upright, one by one, quietly, but passing along as quickly\r\n        as possible. Parker, however, after the sergeant passed, became\r\n        much excited and terrified, and lost his way. He made some noise,\r\n        and a sentry challenged, but without answering, the rest hurried\r\n        towards the half-moon battery where the flagstaff is. Passing\r\n        round the old telegraph post on one side, near the stabling\r\n        attached to the officers' quarters, a sentinel there with side-\r\n        arms only, or, as he is technically termed 'a flying Dick,'\r\n        challenged, and Theller asserts he promptly answered, 'Officer of\r\n        the guard,' when the countersign being demanded, he muttered,\r\n        'teen,' having learned during the confinement that the countersign\r\n        of the Guards ordinarily ended so--seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,\r\n        or such like--and the sentry, fancying from the cap with a gold\r\n        lace band on it, which, having undone his cloak, Theller placed\r\n        upon his head, that he was one of the officers, suffered him to\r\n        pass. Parker had got among the firewood, and was making a noise.\r\n        Dodge was running about on the top of the wall, making signals for\r\n        Grace and other friends who were to be outside, but could see no\r\n        one there. The haulyards of the flagstaff were then partially cut\r\n        down with a penknife. An alarm was now given by an officer of the\r\n        garrison who accidentally came upon Culver, one of the escaping\r\n        party, and in a moment the drums beat and the guard turned out.\r\n        The officers rushed out of the mess-room. An artilleryman detected\r\n        Parker, and the cry arose that the American prisoners were loose\r\n        and escaping. Some immediately ran towards the prison, whilst\r\n        others dragged Parker to the guard-room, and yet others began to\r\n        search about for the 'General,' Colonel Dodge, Culver and Hall,\r\n        whom Parker intimated, in reply to a question put to him by an\r\n        officer, had not come out. There was no alternative but to jump\r\n        from the wall to the flat part of the precipice below, on which\r\n        the wall is built, what Theller first did. For an instant he hung\r\n        by his hands, then dropped, and alighted on his feet on the solid\r\n        rock, falling back on his head. He was stunned, and lay a minute\r\n        or two unconscious. When he came to himself, he heard Dodge\r\n        inquiring if he was hurt, and replied in the negative, telling him\r\n        to throw down the bundle of cloaks and leap upon them. Theller had\r\n        broken the outer bone of his leg and dislocated his right ankle\r\n        joint, but had been so stunned that he scarcely felt any pain.\r\n        Culver descended next, and was stunned, the blood gushing from his\r\n        nose and mouth; he had, it is said, also fractured his leg. Culver\r\n        was more fortunate, as he alighted on a pile of cloaks, and was\r\n        little, if at all, hurt. Dodge then, throwing down the piece of\r\n        rope which he had cut from the haulyards to be used in the next\r\n        descent, also slipped down the wall upon the pile of cloaks, and\r\n        was unhurt. The second descent was made with the aid of the rope,\r\n        the end of which was held by two of the party, while Theller with\r\n        his wounded leg slipped down over a piece of cedar post which had\r\n        been accidentally placed against the wall of the ditch. Culver\r\n        followed, then Hall held the rope alone for Dodge, and afterwards\r\n        descended himself as all had done on the first leap, caught as he\r\n        came to the ground, however, by the rest of the party. Dodge, in\r\n        saving Hall from falling after or as he leaped, sprained his\r\n        wrist. The whole party, however, managed to crawl up the outer\r\n        wall of the ditch, which was faced with dry stone, by inserting\r\n        their hands in the interstices and using their feet as well as\r\n        they could. They rested on the summit of the glacis for a moment,\r\n        and saw the search that was being made for them inside by lights\r\n        that were flashing about into every nook and cranny.\"\r\n\r\n    It would take us too far to describe the subsequent incidents of this\r\n    clever plan of escape. The patriots of St. Roch, Dr. Rousseau, Grace,\r\n    Hunter and others, provided means of escape for the \"sympathisers\"\r\n    which baffled all the ingenuity of the Commandant of the Quebec\r\n    garrison, an old Waterloo hero, Sir James Macdonald, who certainly\r\n    spared neither time, men nor trouble to recover the Citadel prisoners,\r\n    but in vain.\r\n\r\n    We must find room here for another singular incident in connection\r\n    with the Citadel and the Insurrection of 1837-8:--\r\n\r\n        _\"THE MEN OF '37.\"_\r\n\r\n        _THE SECRET SOCIETY OF THE \"CHASSEURS\"--RECOLLECTIONS OF A\r\n        VETERAN--PROPOSED CAPTURE OF QUEBEC._\r\n\r\n        \"A representative of the Montreal _Witness_, in a conversation\r\n        with Mr. Rouillard, Inspector of Buildings, ascertained that he\r\n        had taken a somewhat prominent part in the stirring scenes of the\r\n        Rebellion of 1837. The old gentleman's eyes lit up with the fire\r\n        of youthful enthusiasm when recounting the deeds of the \"Sons of\r\n        Liberty,\" and the secret society of the \"Chasseurs.\"\r\n\r\n        \"I was vigorous and strong in those days, and from my mother\r\n        inherited an ardent love for the country in which I was born.  Her\r\n        letters in those days so magnetized me with patriotism that I\r\n        could willingly lay down my life for the cause. I can only,\r\n        however, give you a mere sketch to-day of some of the incidents\r\n        and adventures through which I passed. The 'Sons of Liberty,' in\r\n        Quebec and Montreal, numbered over 20,000 men, but within this\r\n        body there was a secret society called 'Les Chasseurs,' all picked\r\n        and trustworthy men. They formed a secret society and had their\r\n        signs and passwords. It is singular that, though many of those men\r\n        were placed in perilous positions when the revelations of our\r\n        secrets would have saved them, not one traitor was found to betray\r\n        the cause, and even to this day the secrets of the fraternity are\r\n        unknown. Not very long ago I had occasion to go to Quebec, and was\r\n        introduced to one of the Provincial ministers. I gave the sign of\r\n        the 'Chasseurs' of forty-three years ago. He looked up surprised\r\n        and returned the countersign. We had not met since the memorable\r\n        _émeute_ in the stable yard on St. James street.\r\n\r\n        We used to meet for drill and pistol practice in the upper story\r\n        of the house still standing on the corner of Dorchester and\r\n        Sanguinet streets.\r\n\r\n        There I remember one of our leaders harangued us. He is still\r\n        alive, and Montreal's citizens know him well. He urged us to be\r\n        brave and show no mercy in sweeping every obstacle from oar path,\r\n        and when we gained our liberty we would have 'ample time for--\r\n        tears, repentance and regret.' There used to be a loyal\r\n        association called 'The Doric Club,' which met on Great St. James\r\n        street near our rendezvous. Our men and the members of this club\r\n        used to have many _rencontres_, until it culminated in a challenge\r\n        from the 'Chasseurs' who sent a _cartel_ to the sixty members of\r\n        the Doric Club, offering to meet them with thirty of their picked\r\n        men. The President of the Doric Club sent back a cold formal reply\r\n        to the effect that they wished to have nothing to do with traitors\r\n        and rebels.\r\n\r\n        \"Our secret society had formed the daring design of seizing the\r\n        citadel of Quebec on the same plan as Wolfe's Highlanders. We had\r\n        our rendezvous within a short march of Quebec and on the eventful\r\n        night numbered about 1,500 men, two hundred of whom had come from\r\n        Montreal and the rest from St. Jerome, Three Rivers and other\r\n        places. Each man was armed with a pair of pistols and a bowie-\r\n        knife, and carried on his shoulders a bundle of straw.\r\n\r\n        They had thirty ladders which were to be used in scaling the\r\n        narrow glacis which led to the citadel. The object was to make a\r\n        regular roadway of these ladders, almost like a trellis work\r\n        bridge, up which the patriots might easily pass. The night was\r\n        dark and stormy. We had been waiting in the cold in our white\r\n        blanket coats and white tuques, to assimilate to the color of the\r\n        snow, when the order arrived to prepare to march. The second\r\n        signal came at half-past eleven, and everything was in readiness\r\n        for the attack. At a quarter to twelve the chief came in as pale\r\n        as death and gave the order to disband, as the storm had suddenly\r\n        ceased and the moon shone bright and clear, much to the\r\n        discomfiture of the patriots, who looked forward to an easy\r\n        victory. That chief, who still lives, said it was providential\r\n        that the storm had cleared off before the attack had been made,\r\n        for if it had continued and only cleared when the patriots were\r\n        placing their scaling ladders in the glacis, not a man would have\r\n        survived, as the British troops could have trained several guns on\r\n        this particular spot and swept every living thing into\r\n        destruction.\"\r\n\r\n        Mr. Rouillard said the Roman Catholic clergy were much opposed to\r\n        their society, because it was secret, and had done all in their\r\n        power to break it up, and England is indebted for her supremacy in\r\n        North America to-day to the exertions and assistance given her in\r\n        that troublous period by the Roman Catholic clergy.\" (_Montreal\r\n        Witness, 29th November_ 1880.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_SUBURBS OF QUEBEC._\r\n\r\n\r\n_ST. LOUIS ROAD--CAP ROUGE--STE. FOYE ROAD--THE ROUND DRIVE._\r\n\r\nOn emerging from St. Louis Gate, several handsome terraces and cut stone\r\ndwellings are noticeable. We may mention Hon. Frs. Langelier's, Mr.\r\nShehyn's, and the Hamel Terrace--quite a credit to the new town. The new\r\ntown outside of the walls, like that of New Edinburgh, in beauty and\r\ndesign will very soon cast the historical old town within the walls in the\r\nshade. The next object which attracts the eye is the spacious structure of\r\nthe Skating Rink, the only charge we can make against it, is that it is\r\ntoo close to St. Louis Gate. 'Tis the right thing in the wrong place.\r\nAdjoining stood the old home of the Prentices, in 1791,--Bandon Lodge,\r\n[146] once the abode of Sandy Simpson, [147] whose cat-o'nine-tails must\r\nhave left lively memories in Wolfe's army. Did the beauteous damsel about\r\nwhom Horatio, Lord Nelson, raved in 1782, when, as Commander of H. M.'s\r\nfrigate _Albemarle_, he was philandering in Quebec, ever live here? [148]\r\nThis is more than I can say. On the north side of the _Grande Allée_, the\r\nlofty structure--the new Parliament Buildings--occupies a whole square.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE PARLIAMENTARY AND DEPARTMENTAL BUILDINGS.\r\n\r\n    When completed, the Parliament and Public Buildings of the Province of\r\n    Quebec, erected on the _Grande Allée_, outside of St. Louis Gate,\r\n    will form a square, each side of which externally will measure 300\r\n    feet and will enclose a court l98 x l95 feet. Three facades are now\r\n    completed; they are tenanted by the various Public Departments of the\r\n    Civil Service--the Halls of the Legislative Assembly alone remain to\r\n    be built and the foundations are now in process of construction in\r\n    consequence of the vote of Parliament in 1881. The main facade, now in\r\n    process of construction, will look towards the city walls and face on\r\n    St. Eustache street, or rather on the splendid new area to constitute\r\n    Dufferin Avenue, should St. Eustache street be closed; this street\r\n    being altogether too narrow and in too close proximity to the\r\n    buildings. The Lieut.-Governor will occupy a handsome suite of rooms\r\n    on the second story in the portion of the edifice which lies parallel\r\n    with and faces towards St. Louis Road. The northern facade faces on\r\n    St. Augustin street and the fourth or western facade looks towards St.\r\n    Julia street.\r\n\r\n    The style of architecture is that which was used in French edifices of\r\n    the XVII. century. Pointe Levi greenish sandstone was used for the\r\n    basement.\r\n\r\n    The second and third story are divided by a continuous band, supported\r\n    by an Ionic entablature of Deschambault cut stone.\r\n\r\n    Embossed pilasters in _rustic work_, rising from the basement up\r\n    to the cornice, close the salient angles of each projection. Hard\r\n    Murray Bay sandstone has been used in constructing the interior\r\n    revetment wall of the court, but Deschambault limestone forms the\r\n    masonry of the basement, the bands, cornices, mantle-pieces, and\r\n    lintels.\r\n\r\n    The roof of the building, a handsome one, is of galvanized sheeting,\r\n    the ornaments of zinc; some cast, some wrought and hammered. The\r\n    height of the body of the edifice from the ground to the great cornice\r\n    is 60 feet English measure, and 72 feet to the top of the cornice\r\n    above the attics.\r\n\r\n    Each angle of the square has a pavilion and contains a stone\r\n    sculptured dormer window provided with a costly clock constructed by\r\n    Duquet.\r\n\r\n    Access is had to the inner court by two passages in the centre\r\n    pavilion, which faces St. Julia street.\r\n\r\n    A heraldic _Lion passant_, between two fleur de lys and three maple\r\n    leaves, display the arms of the Province of Quebec. On the piers of\r\n    the first story are cut in relief the escutcheons of the two first\r\n    Lieut.-Governors of the Province of Quebec, sculptured on the central\r\n    window of the second story, is visible from afar, the \"year\" when the\r\n    structure was commenced, \"1878,\" and on the side windows are inscribed\r\n    the monograms of the Governor-General and Lieutenant-Governor, under\r\n    whose administration the edifice was built.\r\n\r\n    The frieze of the main entablature shows the cypher of the reigning\r\n    Sovereign V. R. wreathed in oak leaves.\r\n\r\n    There are at present three main central entrances, the pavilions of\r\n    the angle also contain one each with Ionic pillars.\r\n\r\n    The main facade, only just commenced, differs from the others; instead\r\n    of a pavilion in the centre, it will have a tower or campanile 160\r\n    feet high, flanked by two projections. The ground floor of this tower\r\n    will show a stately entrance to the halls of Assembly of both branches\r\n    of the Legislature, accessible through two semicircular inclined\r\n    planes.\r\n\r\n    The inequalities in the level of the soil at that spot will be\r\n    concealed by terraces on three sides of the stately pile. At the foot\r\n    of the tower the design shows a basin 115x42 feet embraced within the\r\n    walls of the inclined plane, to receive the water of a fountain in a\r\n    portico of Tuscan order of architecture. Four Ionic columns with\r\n    entablatures will deck the main entrance.\r\n\r\n    Niches on different points of the edifice will exhibit statues of\r\n    Jacques Cartier, the discoverer of Canada; of Champlain, the founder\r\n    of Quebec; of deMaisonneuve, the founder of Montreal.\r\n\r\n    On the lantern of the tower will stand forth prominently the Royal\r\n    arms of England, supported by winged genii and wreathed in oak leaves.\r\n    The tower on four sides will contain four huge clocks lit up by\r\n    electric light.\r\n\r\n    Lofty, roomy halls with ceilings arched and decorated with stucco\r\n    panelling; devices and symbols of the quarterings of the Provincial\r\n    arms, lead to the interior of the buildings, which though simple,\r\n    seems well adapted for public offices. Broad, well lighted corridors,\r\n    divide in two each wing and afford ready access to the various\r\n    departments located on both sides.\r\n\r\n    Each flat communicates with the adjoining one by broad, splendid black\r\n    walnut staircases decked with arabesques in gilt carving.\r\n\r\n    The design, elevation and general plan of the edifices, were prepared\r\n    and drafted by Mr. Eugène Taché, the Assistant-Commissioner of Crown\r\n    Lands. The internal divisions and specifications were laid out under\r\n    the direction of Mr. P. Gauvreau, the Engineer of Public Works; the\r\n    contractor was F. X. Cimon, M.P.\r\n\r\n    Messrs. Beaucage & Chaliauvert, undertook the cut stone work, which\r\n    was carried out by their foreman, Mr. Bourgeaud.\r\n\r\n    Messrs. Cerat & Vincent, of Montreal, are contractors for the\r\n    sculpture in stone, and the galvanized iron roof and ornamentation in\r\n    the same material and in zinc was executed by Messrs. De Blois &\r\n    Bernier, of Montreal, whilst Mitchell & Co. contracted for the heating\r\n    apparatus.\r\n\r\n    The whole building when completed is expected to cost about $800,000.\r\n\r\nOpposite looms out the long tea-caddy-looking building, built by the\r\nSandfield Macdonald Government in 1862,--the Volunteer Drill Shed. Its\r\nlength, if not its beauty, attracts notice. \"Ferguson's house,\" next it,\r\nnoted by Professor Silliman in his \"_Tour between Hartford and Quebec in\r\n1819_,\" is now difficult to recognize; its present owner, A. Joseph,\r\nEsq., has added so much to its size. This antiquated dwelling certainly\r\ndoes not belong to a new dispensation. Another land-mark of the past\r\ndeserves notice--the ex-Commander of the Forces' lofty quarters; from its\r\nangular eaves and forlorn aspect it generally went by the name of \"Bleak\r\nHouse.\" I cannot say whether the place was ever haunted, but it ought to\r\nhave been. [149] On the summit of the plateau, formerly known as _Buttes-\r\nà-Nepveu_, and facing Mr. John Roche's stately mansion, Hon. P. Garneau\r\nand M. Bilodeau have constructed handsome terraces of cut-stone dwellings.\r\nWe are now in the _Grande Allée_--the forest avenue, which two hundred\r\nyears ago led to Sillery Wood. On turning and looking back as you approach\r\nBleak House, you have an excellent view of the Citadel, and of the old\r\nFrench works which extend beyond it, to the extremity of the Cape,\r\noverlooking _l'Anse de Mères_. A little beyond Bleak-House, at the top of\r\nwhat is generally known as Perrault's Hill, stands the Perrault [150]\r\nhomestead, dating back to 1820, _l'Asyle Champêtre_--now tastefully\r\nrenovated and owned by Henry Dinning, Esq. The roof and facade of a\r\n_Chalet Suisse_ would much enhance its appearance. The adjoining range of\r\nheights, occupied by the Martello Towers, the Garneau and Bilodeau\r\nTerraces, &c., were called the _Buttes-à-Nepveu_, after one of their first\r\nFrench owners. \"It was here that Murray took his stand on the morning of\r\nApril 28th, 1760, to resist the advance of Levis, and here commenced the\r\nhardest-fought, the bloodiest action of the war, which terminated in the\r\ndefeat of Murray, and his retreat within the city\". The Martello Towers\r\nare bomb-proof, they were four [151] in number, and formed a chain of\r\nforts extending along the ridge from the St. Lawrence to the River St.\r\nCharles. The fact that this ridge commanded the city, unfortunately\r\ninduced Murray to leave it and attempt to fortify the heights, in which he\r\nwas only partially successful, owing to the frost being still in the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe British Government were made aware of the fact, and seeing that from\r\nthe improved artillery the city was now fully commanded from the heights,\r\nwhich are about seven hundred yards distant, decided to build the Towers.\r\nArrangements were accordingly made by Col. Brock, then commanding the\r\ntroops in Canada. In 1806 the necessary materials were collected, and in\r\nthe following year their construction commenced. They were not, however,\r\ncompleted till 1812. The original estimate for the four was £8,000, but\r\nbefore completion the Imperial Government had expended nearly £12,000.\r\nThey are not all of the same size, but, like all Martello Towers, they are\r\ncircular and bomb-proof. The exposed sides are _thirteen_ feet thick\r\nand gradually diminish like the horns of the crescent moon, to seven feet\r\nin the centre of the side next the city walls. The first or lower story\r\ncontains tanks, store-rooms and magazine; the second has cells for the\r\ngarrison, with port-holes for two guns. On the top there used to be one\r\n68-pounder carronade, two 24 and two 9-pounders.\r\n\r\nA party of Arnold's soldiers ascended these heights in November, 1775, and\r\nadvanced quite close to the city walls, shouting defiance at the little\r\ngarrison. A few shots soon dispersed the invaders, who retraced their\r\nsteps to Wolfe's Cove. At the _Buttes-à-Nepveu_ great criminals were\r\nformerly executed. Here, La Corriveau, the St. Vallier Lafarge, met her\r\ndeserved fate, in 1763, after being tried by one of Governor Murray's\r\nCourts-martial for murdering her husband. After death she was hung in\r\nchains, or rather in a solid iron cage, at the fork of four roads, at\r\nLevi, close to the spot where the Temperance Monument has since been\r\nbuilt. The loathsome form of the murderess caused more than one shudder\r\namongst the peaceable peasantry of Levi, until some brave young men one\r\ndark night, cut down the horrid cage, and hid it deep under ground, next\r\nto the cemetery at Levi, where, close to a century afterwards, it was dug\r\nup and sold to Barnum's agent for his museum.\r\n\r\nSergeant Jas. Thompson describes in his diary, under date 18th Nov., 1782,\r\nanother memorable execution:\r\n\r\n\"This day two fellows were executed for the murder and robbery of Capt.\r\nStead, Commander of one of the Treasury Brigs, on the evening of the 31st\r\nDec., 1779, between the Upper and Lower Town. The criminals went through\r\nPort St. Louis, about 11 o'clock, at a slow and doleful pace, to the place\r\nwhere justice had allotted them to suffer the most ignominious death. It\r\nis astonishing to see what a crowd of people followed the tragic scene.\r\nEven our people on the works (Cape Diamond) prayed Capt. Twiss for leave\r\nto follow the hard-hearted crowd.\" It was this Capt. Twiss who\r\nsubsequently furnished the plan and built a temporary citadel in 1793.\r\n\r\nIn 1793, we have also, recorded in history, another doleful procession of\r\nred-coats, the Quebec Garrison accompanying to the same place of execution\r\nas a mess-mate (Draper), a soldier of the Fusileers, then commanded by the\r\nyoung Duke of Kent, who, after pronouncing the sentence of death, as\r\ncommander, over the trembling culprit kneeling on his coffin, as son and\r\nrepresentative of the Sovereign, exercised the Royal prerogative of mercy\r\nand pardoned poor Draper.\r\n\r\nLook down Perrault's hill towards the south. There stands, with a few\r\nshrubs and trees in the foreground, the Military Home--where infirm\r\nsoldiers, their widows and children, could find a refuge. It has recently\r\nbeen purchased and converted into the \"Female Orphan Asylum.\" It forms the\r\neastern boundary of a large expanse of verdure and trees, reaching the\r\nsummit of the lot originally intended by the Seminary of Quebec for a\r\nBotanical Garden; subsequently it was contemplated to build their new\r\nseminary there to afford the boys abundance of fresh air. Alas! Other\r\ncounsels prevailed.\r\n\r\nIts western boundary is a road leading to the new District Jail--a stone\r\nstructure of great strength, surmounted with a diminutive tower, admirably\r\nadapted, one would imagine, for astronomical pursuits. From its glistening\r\ncupola, Commander Ashe's Provincial Observatory is. visible to the east.\r\n\r\nI was forgetting to notice the substantial building, dating from 1855--the\r\nLadies' Home. The Protestant Ladies of Quebec have here, at no small\r\nexpense and trouble, raised a useful asylum, where the aged and infirm may\r\nfind shelter. This, and the building opposite, St. Bridget's Asylum, with\r\nits growing fringe of trees and green plots, are decided ornaments to the\r\n_Grande Allée_.\r\n\r\nThe old burying ground of 1832, with all its ghastly memories of the\r\nAsiatic scourge, has assumed quite an ornate, nay a respectable aspect.\r\nClose to the toll-bar on the _Grande Allée_, may yet be seen one of\r\nthe meridian stones which serve to mark the western boundary of the city,\r\nbeyond the Messrs. Lampson's mansion. On the adjoining domain, well named\r\n\"Battlefield Cottage,\" formerly the property of Col. Charles Campbell, now\r\nowned by Michael Connolly, Esq., was the historic well out of which a cup\r\nof water was obtained to moisten the parched lips of the dying hero, James\r\nWolfe, on the 13th September, 1759. The well was filled in a few years\r\nago, but not before it was nigh proving fatal to Col. Campbell's then\r\nyoung son,--(Arch. Campbell, Esq., of Thornhill.) Its site is close to the\r\nwestern boundary fence, in the garden, behind \"Battlefield Cottage.\" Here\r\nwe are at those immortal plains--the Hastings of the two races once\r\narrayed in battle against one another at Quebec. The western boundary of\r\nthe Plains is a high fence enclosing Marchmont, for years the cherished\r\nfamily seat of John Gilmour, Esq., now occupied by Col. Fred Turnbull, of\r\nthe Canadian Hussars.\r\n\r\nOn the north-east corner of the Belvedere Road, may be seen a range of\r\nglass houses, put up by J. Doig, formerly gardener at Benmore.\r\n\r\nA few minutes more brings the tourist to the Hon. D. Price's villa, Wolfe-\r\nfield, where may be seen the precipitous path up the St. Denis burn, by\r\nwhich the Highlanders and British soldiers gained a footing above, on the\r\n13th September, 1759, and met in battle array to win a victory destined to\r\nrevolutionize the New World. The British were piloted in their ascent of\r\nthe river by a French prisoner brought with them from England--Denis de\r\nVitré, formerly a Quebecer of distinction. Their landing place at Sillery\r\nwas selected by Major Robert Stobo, who had, in May, 1759, escaped from a\r\nFrench prison in Quebec, and joined his countrymen, the English, at\r\nLouisbourg, from whence he took ship again to meet Admiral Saunders' fleet\r\nat Quebec. The tourist next drives past Thornhill, for years owned by\r\nArch. Campbell, Esq., P.S.C., Sir Francis Hincks' old home when Premier to\r\nLord Elgin. Opposite appear the leafy glades of Spencer Wood, so grateful\r\na summer retreat, that Lord Elgin used to say, \"There he not only loved to\r\nlive, but would like to rest his bones.\" Next comes Spencer Grange, the\r\nseat of J. M. LeMoine, Esq.; then Woodfield, the homestead, of the Hon.\r\nWm. Sheppard [152] in 1847, later on of Messrs. John Lawson and Jas Gibb.\r\n[153] Facing the Woodfield property, on the Gomin Road, are visible the\r\nextensive vineries and peach houses of Hon. Geo. Okill Stuart, Judge of\r\nthe Vice-Admiralty Court. The eye next dwells on the rustic church of St.\r\nMichael, embowered in evergreens. This handsome little temple of worship\r\nwhere the Governors of Canada usually attended, when living at Spencer\r\nWood, contain several memorial window. Southwards looms out, at _Sous-\r\nles-Bois_, the stately convent of _Jésus-Marie_; on the edge of the bank,\r\nto the south-east, at _Pointe-à-Pizeau_, stands the R. C. Church of St.\r\nColomb de Sillery, in a most commanding position; on the Sillery heights,\r\nnorth-west of the Church of St. Michael, the late Bishop George J.\r\nMountain owned a delightful summer retreat, recently sold to Albert H.\r\nFurniss, Esq.; then you meet with villas innumerable--one of the most\r\nconspicuous is Benmore House, Col. Rhodes' country seat. Benmore is well\r\nworthy of a call, were it only to procure a _bouquet_. This is not merely\r\nthe Eden of roses; Col. Rhodes has combined the farm with the garden. His\r\nunderground rhubarb and mushroom cellars, his boundless asparagus beds and\r\nstrawberry plantations, are a credit to Quebec.\r\n\r\nNext come Clermont, [154] Beauvoir, [155] Kilmarnock, [156] Cataraqui,\r\n[157] Kilgraston, [158] Kirk-Ella, [159] Meadow Bank, [160] Ravenswood,\r\n[161] Dornald, [162] until, after a nine miles' drive, Redclyffe closes\r\nthe rural landscape--Redclyffe, [163] on the top of _Cap Rouge_\r\nPromontory. There, many indications yet mark the spot where Roberval's\r\nephemeral colony wintered as far back as 1542. You can now, if you like,\r\nreturn to the city by the same route, or select the Ste. Foye Road,\r\nskirting the classic heights where General Murray, six months after the\r\nfirst battle of the Plains, lost the second, on the 28th April, 1760; the\r\nSt. Foye Church was then occupied by the British soldiers. Beauséjour is a\r\nbeautiful demesne, where M. Ls. Bilodeau has several reservoirs, for the\r\npropagation of trout. Your gaze next rests on Holland House, Montgomery's\r\nheadquarters in 1775, behind which is Holland tree, overshadowing, as of\r\nyore, the grave of the Hollands. [164]\r\n\r\nThe view, from the St. Foye Road, of the gracefully meandering St. Charles\r\nbelow, especially during the high tides, is something to be remembered.\r\nThe tourist shortly after detects the iron pillar, surmounted by a bronze\r\nstatue of Bellona, presented in 1855 by Prince Napoleon Bonaparte--\r\nintended to commemorate the fierce struggle at this spot on the 28th\r\nApril, 1760. In close vicinity, appear the bright _parterres_ or\r\numbrageous groves of Bellevue, [165] Hamwood, [166] Bijou, [167]\r\nWestfield, [168] Sans-Bruit, and the narrow gothic arches of Finlay\r\nAsylum; soon you re-enter by St. John's Suburbs, with the broad basin of\r\nthe St. Charles and the pretty Island of Orleans staring you in the face.\r\n\r\nThe principal objects to be noted in this street are: on the north side,\r\nSt. John's Church, built in 1848--a large but not very elegant temple of\r\nR. C. worship, capable of seating 2,000 persons; on the south side, St.\r\nMathew's Church, (Church of England,) a handsome structure, whose\r\nbeginnings, in 1828; were associated with the late Bishop G. J. Mountain's\r\nministrations and munificence. The exertions of the Rev. Chs. Hamilton and\r\nthe generous donations of his brother, Robert Hamilton, and other members\r\nof the family, have been mainly instrumental in enlarging and decorating\r\nthis building. Close by, is the new French Protestant Church. We shall\r\nclose this short sketch with a mention of the \"Quebec Protestant Burying\r\nGround,\" originally bought by the Government of the Province of Quebec,\r\nfrom the heirs of St. Simon, partly on the 9th December, 1771, and partly\r\non the 22nd August, 1778. In the year 1823, Lord Dalhousie made a grant of\r\nthis ground to the \"Trustees of the Protestant Burying Ground,\" in whose\r\nhands it has remained until the 19th May,, 1860, when the cemetery was\r\ndeclared closed by the 23rd Vict., chap. 70. Major Thomas Scott, Pay-\r\nmaster of the 70th Regiment, a brother to Sir Walter, was buried here in\r\n1823. Major Thomas Scott was at one time charged with having written\r\n\"_Rob Roy_.\" And next to St. John Gate, looms out the handsome new\r\nbuilding of the Y. M. C. A Association facing the new Montcalm Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ASSOCIATION HALL.\r\n\r\n    \"The first Young Men's Christian Association in this city was\r\n    organized about twenty years ago, but it soon collapsed, having run\r\n    into debt. A second attempt resulted in the formation of another\r\n    Association in 1867, which was also a failure. The present Association\r\n    was established in January, 1870. It had a very small beginning--five\r\n    young men met in a merchant's office in the Lower Town for prayer and\r\n    conference and they formed the nucleus of the present Association.\r\n    John C. Thomson, Esq., now President of the Association, a gentleman\r\n    well known for his active interest in all good works, was one of the\r\n    five. Soon after this prayer meeting, a canvass was made among young\r\n    men, and 150 names obtained. Henry Fry Esq., merchant, was elected\r\n    first President, and Mr. W. Ahern, Secretary. For three years the\r\n    Association occupied rooms over the hardware store of Messrs. Bélanger\r\n    & Gariépy, Fabrique street, and, in 1873, removed to the rooms above\r\n    Mr. McLeod's drug store, which it vacated to enter upon an enlarged\r\n    sphere of labour in its elegant new building. It is admirably\r\n    situated, facing the Montcalm market.\"\r\n\r\n    \"In October 1875, a delegation of Y. M. C. A. workers visited this\r\n    city, including Messrs. Crombie, Budge, Cole, &c. The revival services\r\n    which followed their visit will still be fresh in the memory of our\r\n    readers. Two results, both fraught with very great importance to the\r\n    Association, followed their visit. One was the engagement of Mr. T. S.\r\n    Cole as permanent Secretary, the other was the development of a scheme\r\n    for the construction of a building to be specially adapted, and\r\n    regularly set apart for the use of the Association. On a memorable\r\n    Monday evening in October, 1877, in the Methodist Church in this city,\r\n    the scheme was first publicly discussed. At this meeting some $5,000\r\n    was subscribed, and the canvass next day resulted in large additions\r\n    to the above. Up to the present, $19,000 have been subscribed towards\r\n    the structure, and over $15,000 paid in, including the proceeds of the\r\n    ladies' bazaar last year (1879).\r\n\r\n    \"The site of the building, one of the most valuable, and certainly one\r\n    of the most eligible for the purpose in the city was obtained by\r\n    purchase from the Dominion Government by auction in the month of\r\n    January, 1878. The plans for the building were secured by competition,\r\n    the successful architect being Mr. J. F. Peachy. The cost of the whole\r\n    building, when completed, will be $40,000, but at present only the\r\n    front portion has been erected. The back wing will be commenced when a\r\n    few thousand dollars more have been subscribed towards it. It is to\r\n    contain the gymnasium below, and above a large hall 100 feet by 56,\r\n    with seating accommodation for 700 people on the floor and 300 in the\r\n    galleries. This hall will be furnished with an independent entrance\r\n    from Glacis street, twelve feet wide. The lot upon which the present\r\n    building is erected contains 21,000 square feet, being 186 feet in\r\n    depth, and having a frontage on St. John street of 106 feet. The front\r\n    building covers the whole extent of frontage and has a depth of 50\r\n    feet. It is built of stone and brick, the whole front being stone and\r\n    cut glass. It contains three flats including the mansard. Over the\r\n    main entrance is an open Bible, upon which is engraved Matt. XXIII.,\r\n    8. Above the centre Window in raised letters in stone, are the words\r\n    \"Quebec Young Men's Christian Association, 1879.\" Immediately behind\r\n    the front structure is a small building which forms a room for the\r\n    daily prayer meeting. It may be reached from Glacis street, and also\r\n    by a staircase leading down to it from the entrance hall of the main\r\n    building.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The lower part of the edifice has been fitted up as stores. The main\r\n    entrance to Association Hall, in the middle of the front, is by a\r\n    spacious staircase twelve feet wide, at the foot of which are elegant\r\n    double swinging doors with plate glass. Beneath this stairway is the\r\n    heating apparatus, which has been placed in the building by Mr. Thomas\r\n    Andrews, of St. John street, and is on an entirely new and highly\r\n    approved principle. The whole second flat, is set apart for\r\n    Association use. One-half of it composes the reading room. This\r\n    magnificent apartment which is one of the finest reading rooms on the\r\n    Continent, is 45 by 46 feet, having a height of 18 feet, with windows\r\n    on three sides, the balcony window on the North overlooking the whole\r\n    of the country between St. Roch's and the Laurentian Mountains.\r\n    Opposite the top of the stairway on the landing of this flat, is the\r\n    door leading to the Secretary's room, which is fitted with glass, in\r\n    order that the Secretary may see everybody coming up stairs into the\r\n    reading room or elsewhere. This room is about 12 by 18 feet, and has\r\n    on either side of it, the committee room and cloak room, both of about\r\n    similar dimensions. Opposite the committee room is the lavatory, &c.,\r\n    for the use of members. At the West end of this flat the rooms both\r\n    front and back are parlours, with folding doors between, so that while\r\n    one may be used for conversational purposes or such like, the other\r\n    may be fitted with a piano and also with games, such as chess,\r\n    draughts, &c. The upper flat, which contains also very handsome rooms,\r\n    beautifully finished, is divided into two portions, one to be occupied\r\n    exclusively by the Secretary, and containing dining and drawing rooms\r\n    divided by folding doors, four bed-rooms, kitchen, store room, &c. The\r\n    other part is divided between the caretaker's apartments, and the bath\r\n    room, which is specially for the use of members. The committee also\r\n    reserve a spare room in this portion of the building. From the roof of\r\n    the structure, which is reached by a staircase leading into the tower,\r\n    a magnificent view is obtained of every part of the city and of all\r\n    the surrounding country. Special credit in connection with its\r\n    erection is certainly merited by the contractor, Mr. John Hatch, and\r\n    the architect, Mr. J. F. Peachy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_MODERN QUEBEC_.\r\n\r\n  \"I can re-people with the Past; and of\r\n  The Present there is still, for eye and thought\r\n  And meditation, chasten'd down, enough.\"\r\n                                 --(CHILDE HAROLD.)\r\n\r\n\r\nQuebec, with the limitations set forth elsewhere, under the English\r\nregime, was governed by Justices of the Peace, who sat in special\r\nsessions, under authority of Acts of the Provincial Legislature, until\r\n1833. In 1832 the city was incorporated (1 William IV., chap. 52,), Its\r\nfirst Mayor, elected in 1833, was a barrister of note, Elzéar Bédard,\r\nEsq., subsequently Mr. Justice Elzéar J.S.C. The amended Act of\r\nIncorporation of the City of Quebec, the 29th Vic., cap. 57, sanctioned on\r\nthe 18th September, 1865, thus defines the limits of the city, the number\r\nand limits of the wards:--\"The City of Quebec, for all municipal purposes,\r\ncomprises the whole extent of land within the limits assigned to the said\r\ncity by a certain proclamation of His Excellency Sir Alured Clarke,\r\nbearing date the 7th May, 1792, and in addition all land extending to low\r\nwater mark of the River St. Lawrence, in front of the said city, including\r\nthe shore of the River St Charles, opposite the city, as limited by high\r\nwater mark on the north side of the said river, from, the prolongation of\r\nthe west line of St. Ours street to the west line of the farm of the Nuns\r\nof the Hôtel Dieu; thence running southwards along the said line, about\r\n550 feet, to the southern extremity of a pier erected on the said farm, at\r\nlow water mark; thence running due east, about 800 feet, to the\r\nintersection of the line limiting the beach grants of the Seigniory of\r\nNotre Dame des Anges, at low water; and finally, thence along the said\r\nbeach line, running north 40 degrees east, to the intersection of the\r\nprolongation of the line of the Commissioners for the Harbour of Quebec,\r\nand thence following the said Commissioners' line to the westerly line of\r\nthe city. The said city also comprises all wharves, piers and other\r\nerections made or to be made in the said River St. Lawrence, opposite to\r\nor adjoining the said city, though extending beyond the low water mark of\r\nthe said river, and being within the said Commissioners' line, and even\r\nbeyond the same, should it be hereafter extended or reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOUNDARIES OF THE WARDS._\r\n\r\n\"The said city is divided into eight wards, to wit: St. Louis Ward, Palace\r\nWard, St. Peter's Ward, Champlain Ward, St. Roch's Ward, Jacques Cartier\r\nWard, St. John's Ward and Montcalm Ward.\r\n\r\n1st. St. Louis Ward comprises all that part of the Upper Town within the\r\nfortifications, and south of a line drawn from Prescott Gate to St John's\r\nGate, along the middle of Mountain street, Buade street, Fabrique street,\r\nand St. John street.\r\n\r\n2nd. Palace Ward comprises all that part of the Upper Town within the\r\nfortifications, and not included in St. Louis Ward.  3rd. St. Peter's Ward\r\ncomprises all that part of the Lower Town bounded on the south by a line\r\ndrawn in the middle of Sous-le-Fort street, and prolonged in the same\r\ndirection to low water mark in the River St. Lawrence at the one end, and\r\nto the cliff below the Castle of St. Louis at the other, and on the west\r\nby the eastern limits of the Parish of St. Roch, together with all the\r\nwharves, piers and other erections, opposite to this part of the Lower\r\nTown, although built beyond low water mark in the said river.\r\n\r\n4th. Champlain Ward comprises all that part of the Lower Town lying\r\nbetween St. Peter's Ward and the limits of the said city, together with\r\nall wharves, piers and other erections, opposite thereto, although built\r\nbeyond the low water mark in the said river.\r\n\r\n5th. St. Roch's Ward comprises all that part of the Parish of St. Roch\r\nwhich lies within the limits of the said City of Quebec, on the north-west\r\nside of a line drawn in the middle of St. Joseph street, from one end to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n6th. Jacques Cartier Ward comprises all that part of the Parish of St.\r\nRoch which lies within the limits of the said City of Quebec, not\r\ncomprised in St. Roch's Ward.\r\n\r\n7th. St John's Ward comprises all that space bounded by Jacques Cartier\r\nWard, the fortifications, the limits of the said city on the west, and a\r\nline drawn in the middle of St. John street from St. John's Gate to the\r\nwestern limits of the city.\r\n\r\n8th. Montcalm Ward comprises all that space bounded by the fortifications\r\non the east, and on the west by the city limits, on the north by St John's\r\nWard, and on the south by the _cime du cap_ of the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nThe city is administered by a Mayor, holding office for two years, at a\r\nsalary of not more than $1,200, nor less than $600, per annum; and by\r\neight Aldermen and sixteen Councillors, returned by the eight wards,--\r\nelected to serve gratuitously three years by the duly qualified electors\r\nof each ward: no one is eligible as Mayor, Aldermen or Councillor unless\r\nhe be a British subject, by birth or naturalization, and of the full age\r\nof twenty-one years, and owning within the city limits real estate, free\r\nfrom encumbrance, of the value of $2,000. Quebec contains ten small\r\n_Fiefs_ or Domaines. The _Fief_ Sault-au-Matelot belongs to the Seminary.\r\nThe Ursuline Nuns, the R. C. Church (_La Fabrique_), the Heirs LaRue, the\r\nHôtel-Dieu Nuns, the Récollet Friars, each had his _Fief_. The _Fief de la\r\nMiséricorde_ (Mercy) belongs to the Hôtel-Dieu. The Heirs LaRue own the\r\n_Fief de Bécancour_ and that of _de Villeraie_; there is also the _Fief\r\nTasseville_. The _Fief_ of the Récollets--or Franciscan Friars--the order\r\nbeing extinct, reverted to the Crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _WAR DEPARTMENT PROPERTY IN QUEBEC CITY AND DISTRICT._\r\n\r\n    _As per Schedule, Consolidated Statutes of Canada (22 Vict.)

There was a poser for a _galant homme_; a crusher\r\nfor the first _littérateur_ of ... the parish. In vain did we allege\r\nwe were not a \"Christopher North,\" but a mere retiring \"antiquaire\"--a\r\nlover of books, birds, flowers, &c. The innate civility of a Frenchman\r\nelicited from us an unreflective affirmative reply. Thus, compassionate\r\nreader, was entrapped, caught and committed the first _littérateur_\r\nof Sillery--irrevocably handed over to the tender mercies of all the\r\ncritics, present and future, in and out of the parish. Oh, my friends,\r\nwhat a crunching up of literary bones in store! what an ample repast was\r\nthus prepared for all the reviewers--the Jeffreys and LaHarpes--in and out\r\nof the parish, should the luckless _littérateur_ fail to assign fairy\r\nscenery--important historical events--great battles, not only to each\r\nrenowned spot, but even to the merest potato-patch, turnip-ground or\r\ncabbage-garden within our corporate limits? Yes, tremble for him.\r\n\r\nJoking apart, is there not a formidable difficulty besetting our path--the\r\ninsipidity and monotony inseparable from the necessity which will devolve\r\non us of having constantly to discover new beauties in spots identical in\r\ntheir main features; and should we, in order to vary the theme, mix up the\r\nhumorous with the rural, the historical, or the antiquarian style, may not\r\nfun and humour be mistaken for satire--a complimentary notice for\r\nflattery, above all others, a thing abhorrent to our nature? But 'tis vain\r\nto argue. That fatal \"yes\" has been uttered, and no true knight goes back\r\nfrom his plighted word. There being no help, we devoutly commend our case\r\nto St. Columba, St. Joseph, and the archangel St. Michel, the patrons of\r\nour parish, and set to our task, determined to assume a wide margin, draw\r\nheavily on history, and season the whole with short anecdotes and glimpses\r\nof domestic life, calculated to light up the past and present.\r\n\r\nO critic, who would fain seek in \"Our Parish\"--in our homes--great\r\narchitectural excellence, we beseech you to pause! for the majority of\r\nthem no such pretension is set up. Nowhere, indeed, on our soil are to be\r\nfound ivied ruins, dating back to doomsday book, moated castle, or\r\nmediaeval tower. We have no Blenheims, no Walton Halls, nor Chatsworths,\r\nnor Woburn abbeys, nor Arundel castles, to illustrate every style of\r\narchitectural beauty, rural embellishment, and landscape. A Dainpierre, a\r\nRochecotte, a LaGaudinière, may suit old France: they would be lost in New\r\nFrance. Canadian cottages, the best of them, are not the stately country\r\nhomes of\r\n\r\n          \"Old pheasant-lords,\r\n  ... Partridge-breeders of a thousand years,\"\r\n\r\ntypifying the accumulated wealth of centuries or patrician pride; nor are\r\nthey the gay _châteaux_ of _La Belle France_. In the Canada of the past,\r\nwe could--in many instances we had to--do without the architect's skill;\r\nnature having been lavish to us in her decorations, art could be dispensed\r\nwith. Our country dwellings possess attractions of a higher class, yea, of\r\na nobler order, than brick and mortar moulded by the genius of man can\r\nimpart. A kind Providence has surrounded them in spring, summer and autumn\r\nwith scenery often denied to the turreted castle of the proudest nobleman\r\nin Old England. Those around Quebec are more particularly hallowed by\r\nassociations destined to remain ever memorable amongst the inhabitants of\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nSome of our larger estates, like Belmont (comprising 450 acres,) date back\r\nmore than two centuries, whilst others, though less ancient, retrace\r\nvividly events glorious in the same degree to the two races, who, after\r\nhaving fought stoutly for the mastery, at last hung out the olive branch\r\nand united long since, willing partners, in the bonds of a common\r\nnationality, neither English nor French, though participating largely of\r\nboth, and have linked their destinies together as Canadians. Every\r\ntraveller in Canada, from Baron La Hontan, who \"preferred the forests of\r\nCanada to the Pyrénées of France,\" to the Hon. Amelia Murray, Charlevoix,\r\nLaGalissonière, Peter Kalm, Isaac Weld, John Lambert, Heriot, Silliman,\r\nDickens, Lever, Ampère, Marmier, Rameau, Augustus Sala, have united in\r\npronouncing our Quebec landscape so wild, so majestic, and withal so\r\ncaptivating, as to vie in beauty with the most picturesque portions of the\r\nOld or the New World.\r\n\r\nLet us first sketch \"Our Parish,\" the home of our forefathers--the home of\r\nour children.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SILLERY._\r\n\r\nHenry IV. of France had for his chancellor, in 1607, Nicholas Brulart de\r\nSillery, a worthy and distinguished magistrate, who, as state councillor,\r\never enjoyed the confidence of his sovereign until death closed his useful\r\ncareer in 1627, at the ripe age of 80. He was the eldest brother: his\r\nfather had also for years basked in the smiles of good King Henry IV. for\r\nhis unwavering adherence to his fortunes. To this eminent lawyer and\r\nstatesman was born a patriarchal family of sons and daughters. The\r\nyoungest of his sons, Noël Brulart de Sillery, [169] having brilliantly\r\ncompleted his studies at Paris in the classics, entered, at the age of 18,\r\nthe military order of the Knights of Malta, and resided twelve years in\r\nthat island as a knight; his martial bearing and ability, modesty, and\r\nuniform good conduct soon paved the way for him to the highest dignities\r\nin this celebrated Order. Soon the Grand Master appointed him \"Commandeur\r\nde Troyes\"; this preferment yielded him 40,000 livres per annum.\r\n\r\nOn his return to Paris in 1607, the favour of the court and the protection\r\nof Marie de Medicis were the means of having him nominated Knight of\r\nHonour. His talents, birth, deportment and position soon procured him the\r\nappointment of French Ambassador to the Court of Spain in 1614, which high\r\nposition he left for that of Ambassador at Rome in 1622, where he replaced\r\nthe Marquis of Coeuvres. He spent two years in the Eternal City, and\r\nsubsequently acknowledged that it was there that he conceived the idea\r\nfirst of embracing Holy Orders; Cardinal de LaValette replacing him at the\r\nRoman Court as French _Chargé d'Affaires_. From what can be gleaned\r\nin history, this distinguished personage led a princely life, his enormous\r\nrent-roll furnishing the means for a most lordly establishment of\r\nretainers, liveries and domains. [170] His fancy for display, great though\r\nit was, never, however, made him lose sight of the poor, nor turn a deaf\r\near to the voice of the needy.\r\n\r\nIn 1626, the Pope (Barberini), Urban the VIII., having proclaimed a\r\njubilee, the ex-ambassador, as if a new light had dawned on him, and under\r\nthe guidance of a man famous for his pious and ascetic life, Vincent de\r\nPaul, determined to reform his house and whole life. Thus, a few years\r\nafter, viz., in 1632, the Commandeur de Sillery sold to Cardinal Richelieu\r\nhis sumptuous and princely hôtel in Paris, called Sillery, entered Holy\r\nOrders in 1634, and devoted all the energy of his mind and his immense\r\nwealth to the propagation of the faith amongst the aborigines of Canada,\r\nhaving been induced to do so by the Commandeur de Razili, who had\r\npreviously solicited him to join the company des \"Cents Associés,\" or\r\nHundred Partners, of which Razili was a member.\r\n\r\nThe Commandeur de Sillery inaugurated his benevolent purpose by placing\r\n12,000 livres in the hands of Father Charles Lalemant, a zealous Jesuit;\r\nthis was the beginning of the mission which, through gratitude to its\r\nfounder, was called Sillery--it was distant about four miles and a half\r\nfrom Quebec, on the north shore of the St. Lawrence; date of the\r\nfoundation, July, 1637. [171] History has preserved a letter addressed\r\nfrom Paris by the Commandeur de Sillery to the Chevalier de Montmagny,\r\ngovernor of the colony, in which the benevolent man asked the Governor to\r\nratify a grant of \"twelve arpents\" made to him in the city itself by the\r\ncompany of the Hundred Partners, and also to ratify a promised grant of\r\nother lands to open a seminary or school to educate Algonquin and\r\nMontagnais children, although, at the request of the Indians, the\r\nsettlement became, in 1638, more extensive, and comprised also the\r\nresidence of the christianized Indians. Negabamat and Nenasesenat were the\r\nfirst to establish their families there. On the last day of June, 1665, we\r\nwill find the eloquent Negabamat, then a resident of Quebec, sent by his\r\ntribe to harangue and compliment the great Marquis of Tracy on his arrival\r\nat Quebec. (_Relations_, 1665, _p_. 4.) Father LeJeune, a learned Jesuit,\r\nhad charge and control over the workmen who were sent out from France at\r\nthe expense of the Commandeur de Sillery; and on the 22nd February, 1639,\r\na permanent bequest was authentically recorded in favor of the mission by\r\nthe Commandeur placing at interest, secured on the Hôtel-de-Ville at\r\nParis, a sum of 20,000 livres tournois. Palisades had been used originally\r\nto protect the settlement; in 1651, the Governor of Quebec, Jean de\r\nLauzon, strengthened the palisades and added redoubts. [172] In 1647 the\r\nchurch of the mission had been placed under the invocation of St. Michael\r\nthe Archangel; hence Sillery Cove, once called St. Joseph's, was, in 1647,\r\nnamed St Michael's Cove.\r\n\r\nThe Commandeur de Sillery extended his munificence to several other\r\nmissionary establishments in Canada and other places. What with the\r\nbuilding of churches, monasteries and hospitals in Champagne, France; at\r\nAnnecy, Savoy; at Paris, and elsewhere, he must, indeed, have been for\r\nthose days a veritable Rothschild in worldly wealth.\r\n\r\nThis worthy ecclesiastic died in Paris on the 26th September, 1640, at the\r\nage of sixty-three years, bequeathing his immense wealth to the Hôtel-Dieu\r\nof that city. Such was, in a few words, the noble career of one of the\r\nlarge-minded pioneers of civilization in primitive Canada, le Commandeur\r\nNoël Brulart de Sillery--such the origin of the name of \"Our Parish,\" our\r\nsweet Canadian Windermere.\r\n\r\nOne of the first incidents, two years after the opening of the mission,\r\nwas the visit paid to it by Madame de la Peltrie, the benevolent founder\r\nof the Ursuline Convent at Quebec. This took place on the 2nd August,\r\n1639, the day after her arrival from Dieppe and stately reception by the\r\nGovernor, M. deMontmagny, who had asked her to dinner the day previous.\r\nThis same year the nuns called _Hospitalières_ (Hôtel-Dieu) opened a\r\ntemporary hospital at Sillery, as the inmates and resident Indians\r\nsuffered fearfully from the ravages of small-pox. In attempting a sketch\r\nof the Sillery of ancient days, we cannot follow a truer nor pleasanter\r\nguide than the old historian of Canada in the interesting notes he\r\npublished on this locality in 1855, after having minutely examined every\r\ninch of ground. \"A year after their arrival at Quebec,\" says Abbé Ferland,\r\n\"in August, 1640, the _Hospitalières_ nuns, desirous of being closer\r\nto the Sillery mission, where they were having their convent built\r\naccording to the wishes of the Duchess D'Aiguillon, left Quebec and\r\nlocated themselves in the house of M. de Puiseaux. They removed from this\r\nhouse at the beginning of the year 1641 to take possession of their\r\nconvent, a mile distant. During that winter no other French inhabitants\r\nresided near them except the missionaries, and they suffered much from\r\ncold and want. But the following year they had the happiness to have in\r\nthe neighbourhood a good number of their countrymen. M. de Maisonneuve,\r\nMlle. Mance, the soldiers and farmers recently arrived from France, took\r\nup their abode at M. de Puiseaux.... They spent the winter there, and paid\r\nus frequent visits, to our mutual satisfaction.\" [173]\r\n\r\nThe mission of St. Joseph at Sillery being constantly threatened by the\r\nFive Nations, the _Hospitalières_ ladies were compelled to leave their\r\nconvent and seek refuge in Quebec on the 29th May, 1644, having thus\r\nspent about three years and a half amongst the savages. [174] The locality\r\nwhere they then resided still goes under the name of \"Convent Cove.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur Pierre Puiseaux, Sieur de l'habitation de Sainte Foye, after\r\nwhom was, called _Pointe-à-Pizeau_, at Sillery, seems to have been a\r\npersonage of no mean importance in his day. Having realized a large\r\nfortune in the West Indies, he had followed Champlain to Canada, bent on\r\ndevoting his wealth to the conversion of the aboriginal tribes. His manor\r\nstood, according to the Abbé Ferland, on that spot in St Michael's Cove on\r\nwhich the St. Michael's Hotel [175]--long kept by Mr. W. Scott--was\r\nsubsequently built, to judge from the heavy foundation walls there. Such\r\nwas the magnificence of the structure that it was reckoned \"the gem of\r\nCanada'--\"_Une maison regardée dans le temps comme le bijou du Canada_,\"\r\nsays the old chronicler. Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve having arrived,\r\nin 1641, with colonists for Montreal, the laird of Ste. Foye [176]\r\ngenerously tendered him the use of his manor. Under the hospitable roof of\r\nthis venerable old gentleman, M. de Maisonneuve, Mlle. Mance, the founder\r\nof the Hôtel Dieu Hospital at Montreal, and Mdme. de la Peltrie spent the\r\nwinter of 1641-2, whilst the intended colonists [177] for Ville-Marie were\r\nlocated close by in the Sillery settlement. During the winter, dissensions\r\ntook place between the future Governor of Montreal, M. de Maisonneuve, and\r\nthe then present Governor of Quebec, Chevalier de Montmagny. It appears\r\nthat on a certain festival a small cannon and also fifteen musket shots\r\nhad been fired without authority; His Excellency Governor Montmagny, in\r\nhigh dudgeon at such a breach of military discipline, ordered Jean Gorry,\r\nthe person who had fired the shots, to be put in irons; Mlle. Mance had\r\nfurnished the powder for this military display The future Governor of\r\nMontreal, Monsieur de Maisonneuve, is said to have, on this occasion,\r\npublicly exclaimed: \"Jehan Gorry, you have been put in irons for my sake\r\nand I affronted! I raise your wages of ten half crowns (dix écus), let us\r\nonly reach Montreal; no one there will prevent us from firing.\" [178]\r\nBravo! M. de Maisonneuve! Peace, however, was restored, and His Excellency\r\nGovernor Montmagny headed in person the expedition which, on the 8th May\r\nfollowing, sailed from St Michael's Cove, Sillery, to found at Montreal\r\nthe new colony. Monsieur Puiseaux accompanied M. de Maisonneuve, to take\r\npart also in the auspicious event, but his age and infirmities compelled\r\nHim soon after to return to France, where he died a few years\r\nsubsequently, and by his last will, executed at LaRochelle on the 21st\r\nJune, 1647, he bequeathed his Ste. Foye property to the support of the\r\nfuture bishops of Quebec. \"The walls of the Sillery Chapel,\" says the\r\nhistorian of Canada previously quoted, \"were still standing about thirty\r\nyears ago, and the foundations of this edifice, of the hospital and of the\r\nmissionary residency are still perceptible to the eye on the spot now\r\noccupied by the offices and stores of Hy. LeMesurier, Esq., at the foot of\r\nthe hill, and opposite the residence of the Honourable Mr. Justice Caron.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amongst the French gentlemen of note who then owned lands at Sillery may\r\nbe mentioned. François de Chavigny, _sieur de Berchéreau qui_,\" adds\r\nAbbé Ferland, \"_occupait un rang élevé dans le colonie. En quelques\r\noccasions, il fut chargé de remplacer le Gouverneur, lors que celui-ci\r\ns'absentait de Québec_.\" Now, dear reader, let it be known to you that\r\nyou are to look with every species of respect on this worthy old denizen\r\nof Sillery, he being, as the Abbé has elsewhere established beyond the\r\nshadow of a doubt, not only the ancestor of several old families, such as\r\nthe Lagorgendières, the Rigaud de Vaudreuils and Tachereaus, but also one\r\nof the ancestors of your humble servant the writer of these lines.\r\n\r\n\"The Sillery settlement contained during the winter of 1646-7, of Indians\r\nonly, about two hundred souls. Two roads led from Quebec to the\r\nsettlement, one the Grande Allée or St. Louis Road, the other the Cove\r\nRoad, skirting the beach. Two grist mills stood in the neighbourhood: one\r\non the St. Denis streamlet which crosses the Grande Allée road (from\r\nThornhill to Spencer Wood)--the dam seems to have been on the Spencer Wood\r\nproperty. 'This mill, and the _fief_ on which it was built, belonged\r\nto M. Juchereau,' one of the ancestors of the Duchesnays. 'Another mill\r\nexisted on the Bell Borne brook,' which crosses the main road, the\r\nboundary between Spencer Grange and Woodfield. Any one visiting these two\r\nstreamlets during the August droughts will be struck with their\r\ndiminutiveness, compared to the time when they turned the two grist mills\r\ntwo hundred years back: the clearing of the adjoining forests, whence they\r\ntake their source, may account for the metamorphosis.\"\r\n\r\nThe perusal of the Rev. Mr. Ferland's work brings us to another\r\noccurrence, which, although foreign to the object of this sketch, deserves\r\nnotice:--\r\n\r\n\"The first horse [179] seen in Canada was landed from a French vessel\r\nabout the 20th June, 1647, and presented as a gift to His Excellency\r\nGovernor Montmagny.\" Another incident deserving of mention occurs under\r\ndate of 20th August, 1653. The Iroquois [180] surprised at Cap Rouge Rev.\r\nFather J. Antoine Poncet and a peasant named Mathurin Tranchelot, and\r\ncarried them off to their country. For three days the rev. missionary was\r\nsubjected to every kind of indignity from the Indian children and every\r\none else. A child cut off one of the captive's fingers. He was afterwards,\r\nwith his companion, tied up during two nights, half suspended in the air;\r\nthis made both suffer horribly; burning coals were applied to their flesh.\r\nFinally, the missionary was handed over to an old squaw; he shortly after\r\nbecame free, and returned to Quebec on the 5th of November, 1653, to the\r\njoy of everybody.\r\n\r\nHis comrade, Tranchelot, after having had his fingers burnt, was finally\r\nconsumed by fire on the 8th September, 1653. Such were some of the\r\nthrilling incidents of daily occurrence at Sillery two centuries ago.\r\n\r\nWhat with breaches of military etiquette by M. de Maisonneuve's colonists,\r\nthe ferocity of skulking Iroquois, and the scrapes their own neophytes\r\noccasionally got into, the reverend fathers in charge of the Sillery\r\nmission must now and again have had lively times, and needed, we would\r\nimagine, the patience of Job, with the devotion of martyrs, to carry out\r\ntheir benevolent views.\r\n\r\nWe read in history [181] how, on one Sunday morning in 1652, the Sillery\r\nIndians being all at mass, a beaver skin was stolen from one of the wig-\r\nwams, on which a council of the chiefs being called, it was decided that\r\nthe robbery had been committed by a Frenchman, [182] enough to justify the\r\nyoung men to rush out and seize two Frenchmen then accidentally passing\r\nby, and in no wise connected--as the Indians even admitted--with the\r\ntheft. The Indian youths were for instantly stripping the prisoners, in\r\norder to compel the Governor of the colony to repair the injury suffered\r\nby the loss of the peltry. One of them, more thoughtful than the rest,\r\nsuggested to refer the matter to the missionary father, informing him at\r\nthe same time that in cases of robbery it was the Indian custom to lay\r\nhold of the first individual they met belonging to the family or nation of\r\nthe suspected robber, strip him of his property, and retain it until the\r\nfamily or nation repaired the wrong. The father succeeded, by appealing to\r\nthem as Christians, to release the prisoners. Fortunately, the real thief,\r\nwho was not a Frenchman, became alarmed, and had the beaver skin restored.\r\n\r\nOld writers of that day occasionally let us into quaint glimpses of a\r\nchurchman's tribulations in those primitive times. The historian Faillon\r\ntells some strange things about Bishop Laval and Governor D'Argenson:\r\ntheir squabble about holy bread. (_Histoire de la Colonie Française en\r\nCanada_, vol. ii., p. 467.) At page 470, is an account of a country\r\ngirl, ordered to be brought to town by Bishop Laval and shut up in the\r\nHôtel-Dieu, she being considered under a spell, cast on her by a miller\r\nwhom she had rejected when he popped the question: the diabolical suitor\r\nwas jailed as a punishment. Champlain relates how a pugnacious parson was\r\ndealt with by a pugnacious clergyman of a different persuasion respecting\r\nsome knotty controversial points. The arguments, however irresistible they\r\nmay have been, Champlain observes, were not edifying either to the savages\r\nor to the French: \"J'ay veu le ministre et nostre curé s'entre battre è\r\ncoup de poing sur le différend de la religion. Je ne scay pas qui estait\r\nle plus vaillant et qui donnait le meilleur coup; mais je scay tres bien\r\nque le ministre se plaignoit quelque fois au Sieur de Mons (Calviniste,\r\ndirecteur de la compagnie) d'avoir ésté battu et vuoidoient en ceste\r\nfaccon les poincts de controverse. Je vois laisse à penser si cela éstait\r\nbeau à voir; les sauvages éstoient tantôt d'un côté, tantôt de l'autre, et\r\nles François meslez selon leur diverse croyance, disaient pis que pendre\r\nde l'une et de l'autre religion.\" The fighting parson had evidently caught\r\na tartar. However, this controversial sparring did _not_ take place at\r\nSillery.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1666 was marked by a novel incident in the annals of the\r\nsettlement. On the 9th of January, [183] 1666, the Governor of the colony,\r\nM. de Courcelles, with M. du Gas as second in command, and M. de Salampar,\r\na volunteer, together with two hundred colonists who had volunteered, and\r\nthree hundred soldiers of the dashing regiment of Carignan, [184] which\r\nthe viceroy, the proud Marquis de Tracy, had brought over from Europe,\r\nafter their return from their campaign in Hungary, sallied forth from the\r\ncapital on snow-shoes. A century and a half later one might have met, with\r\nhis gaudy state carriage and outriders, on that same road, another\r\nviceroy--this time an English one, as proud, as fond of display, as the\r\nMarquis de Tracy--with the Queen's Household Troops, the British\r\nGrenadiers, and Coldstream Guards--the Earl of Durham, one of our ablest,\r\nif not one of the most popular of our administrators. Let us now follow\r\nthe French Governor of 1666, heading his light-hearted soldiers along the\r\nSt. Louis road, all on snow-shoes, each man, His Excellency included,\r\ncarrying on his back from 25 to 30 lbs. of biscuit, &c. The little army is\r\nbound towards the frontiers of New Holland (the State of New York) on a\r\n900 miles' tramp (no railroads in those days), in the severest season of\r\nthe year, to chastise some hostile Indian tribes, after incorporating in\r\nits ranks, during its march, the Three Rivers and Montreal reinforcements.\r\nHistory tells of the intense suffering [185] experienced during the\r\nexpedition by these brave men, some of them more accustomed to Paris\r\n_salons_ than to Canadian forest warfare on snow-shoes, with spruce\r\nboughs and snow-drifts for beds. But let us not anticipate. We must be\r\ncontent to accompany them on that day to the Sillery settlement, a march\r\nquite sufficient for us degenerate Canadians of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nPicture to yourself, our worthy friend, the hurry and scurry at the\r\nMissionary residence on that day--with what zest the chilled warriors\r\ncrowd round the fires of the Indian wigwams, the number of pipes of peace\r\nthey smoked with the chiefs, the fierce love the gallant Frenchmen swore\r\nto the blackeyed Montagnais and Algonquin houris of Sillery, whilst\r\nprobably His Excellency and staff were seated in the residency close by,\r\nresorting to cordials and all those creature comforts to be found in\r\nmonasteries, not forgetting _Grande Chartreuse_, to restore circulation\r\nthrough their benumbed frames!--How the reverend fathers showered down the\r\nblessings of St. Michael, the patron saint of the parish, on the youth and\r\nchivalry of France!--How the Sillery duennas, the _Capitainesses_, closely\r\nwatched the gallant sons of Mars lest some of them [186] should attempt to\r\ninduce their guileless neophytes to seek again the forest wilds, and roam\r\nat large--the willing wives of white men!\r\n\r\nWe shall clip a page from Father Barthélémy Vimont's _Journal of the\r\nSillery Mission_, (Relations des Jesuits, 1643, pp. 12, 13, 14) an\r\nauthentic record, illustrative of the mode of living there; it will, we\r\nare sure, gladden the heart even of an anchorite:--\r\n\r\n\"In 1643, the St. Joseph or Sillery settlement was composed of between\r\nthirty-five and forty Indian families, who lived there the whole year\r\nround except during the hunting season; other nomadic savages occasionally\r\ntarried at the settlement to procure food, or to receive religious\r\ninstruction. That year there were yet but four houses built in the\r\nEuropean fashion; the Algonquins were located in that part of the village\r\nclose to the French residences; the Montagnais, on the opposite side; the\r\nhouses accommodate chiefs only, their followers reside in bark huts until\r\nwe can furnish proper dwellings for them all. In this manner was spent the\r\nwinter season of 1642-3, the French ships left the St Lawrence for France\r\non the 7th October, 1642; a period of profound quiet followed. Our Indians\r\ncontinued to catch eels, (this catch begins in September)--a providential\r\nmeans of subsistence during winter. The French settlers salt their eels,\r\nthe Indians smoke theirs to preserve them. The fishing having ended about\r\nthe beginning of November, they removed their provisions to their houses,\r\nwhen thirteen canoes of Atichamegues Indians arrived, the crews requesting\r\npermission to winter there and be instructed in the Christian religion.\r\nThey camped in the neighborhood of the Montagnais, near to Jean Baptiste,\r\nthe chief or captain of these savages, and placed themselves under the\r\ncharge of Father Buteux, who undertook to christianize both, whilst Father\r\nDequen superintended the religious welfare of the Algonquins. Each day all\r\nthe Indians attended regularly to mass, prayers, and religious\r\ninstruction. Catechism is taught to the children, and the smartest amongst\r\nthem receive slight presents to encourage them, such as knives, bread,\r\nbeads, hats, sometimes a hatchet for the biggest boys. Every evening\r\nFather Dequen calls at every hut and summons the inmates to evening\r\nprayers at the chapel. The _Hospitalières_ nuns also perform their\r\npart in the pious work; Father Buteux discharged similar duties amongst\r\nthe Montagnais and Atichamegues neophytes. The Atichamegues have located\r\nthemselves on a small height back of Sillery. 'When the Reverend Father\r\nvisits them each evening, during the prevalence of snow storms, he picks\r\nhis way in the forest, lantern in hand, but sometimes losing his footing,\r\nhe rolls down the hill.' Thus passed for the Sillery Indians, the early\r\nportion of the winter. In the middle of January they all came and located\r\nthemselves about a quarter of a league from Quebec, to make tobogins and\r\nbegan the first hunt, which lasted about three weeks. Each day they\r\ntravelled a quarter of a league to Quebec to attend mass, generally at the\r\nchapel of the Ursuline Convent, where Father Buteux and also the nuns\r\ninstructed them. In February they sought the deep woods to hunt the\r\nmoose.\" \"On my return to Sillery,\" adds Father Vimont, \"twelve or thirteen\r\ninfirm old Indians, women and children, who had been left behind, followed\r\nme to the Hospital, where we had to provide for them until the return, at\r\nEaster, of the hunting party.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst the savage hordes were being thus reclaimed from barbarism at\r\nSillery, a civilized community a few hundred miles to the east of it were\r\ndescending to the level of savages. We read in Hutchinson's _History of\r\nMassachusetts Bay_, of our Puritan brethren of Boston, occasionally\r\nroasting defenceless women for witchcraft; thus perished, in 1645,\r\nMargaret Jones; and a few years after, in 1656, Mrs. Ann Hibbens, the lady\r\nof a respectable Boston merchant. Christians cutting one another's throats\r\nfor the love of God. O, civilization, where is thy boast!\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1656-7, Sillery contained, of Indians alone, about\r\ntwo hundred souls.\r\n\r\nLet us now sum up the characteristics of the Sillery of ancient days in a\r\nfew happy words, borrowed from the _Notes_ [187] published in 1855 on\r\nthat locality, by the learned Abbé Ferland.\r\n\r\n\"A map of Quebec by Champlain exhibits, about a league above the youthful\r\ncity, a point jutting out into the St. Lawrence, and which is covered with\r\nIndian wigwams. Later on this point received the name of Puiseaux, from\r\nthe first owner of the Fief St. Michael, bounded by it to the southwest.\r\n[188] On this very point at present stands the handsome St. Columba\r\nchurch, surrounded by a village.\" [189]\r\n\r\n\"Opposite to it is the Lauzon shore, with its river _Bruyante_ [190]\r\n(the 'Etchemin'), its shipyards, its numerous shipping, the terminus of\r\nthe Grand Trunk Railway; the villages and churches of Notre Dame de Lévis,\r\nSt. Jean Chrysostôme and Saint Romuald. To your right and to your left the\r\nSt. Lawrence is visible for some twelve or fifteen miles, covered with\r\ninward and outward bound ships. Towards the east the landscape is closed\r\nby Cap Tourment, twelve leagues distant, and by the cultivated heights of\r\nthe _Petite Montagne_ of St. Féréol, exhibiting in succession the\r\n_Côte de Beaupré_, (Beauport), (L'Ange Gardien, &c.) the green slopes\r\nof the Island of Orleans, Cape Diamond, crowned with its citadel, and\r\nhaving at its feet a forest of masts, Abraham's Plains, the Coves and\r\ntheir humming, busy noises, St. Michael's Coves forming a graceful curve\r\nfrom Wolfe's cove to Pointe à Puiseaux. Within this area thrilling events\r\nonce took place, and round these diverse objects historical souvenirs\r\ncluster, recalling some of the most important occurrences in North\r\nAmerica; the contest of two powerful nations for the sovereignty of the\r\nNew World; an important episode of the revolution which gave birth to the\r\nadjoining Republic. Such were some of the events of which these localities\r\nwere the theatre. Each square inch of land, in fact, was measured by the\r\nfootsteps of some of the most remarkable men in the history of America:\r\nJacques Cartier, Champlain, Frontenac, Laval, Phipps, d'Iberville, Wolfe,\r\nMontcalm, Arnold, Montgomery, have each of them, at some time or other,\r\ntrod over this expanse.\r\n\r\n\"Close by, in St. Michael's Cove, M. de Maisonneuve and Mademoiselle Mance\r\npassed their first Canadian winter, with the colonists intended to found\r\nMontreal. Turn your eyes towards the west, and although the panorama is\r\nless extensive, still it awakens some glorious memories. At Cap Rouge,\r\nJacques Cartier established his quarters, close to the river's edge, the\r\nsecond winter he spent in Canada, and was succeeded in that spot by\r\nRoberval, at the head of his ephemeral colony. Near the entrance of the\r\nChaudière river stood the tents of the Abnoquiois, the Etchemins and the\r\nSouriquois Indians, when they came from the shores of New England to smoke\r\nthe calumet of peace with their brethren the French; the river Chaudière\r\nin those days was the highway which connected their country with Canada.\r\nCloser to Pointe à Puiseaux is Sillery Cove where the Jesuit Fathers were\r\nwont to assemble and instruct the Algonquin and Montagnais Indians, who\r\nwere desirous of becoming Christians. It was from that spot that the\r\nneophytes used to carry the faith to the depths of the forest; it was here\r\nthat those early apostles of Christianity congregated before starting with\r\nthe joyous message for the country of the Hurons, for the shores of the\r\nMississippi, or for the frozen regions of Hudson's Bay. From thence went\r\nFather P. Druilletes, the bearer of words of peace on behalf of the\r\nChristians of Sillery, to the Abnoquiois of Kennebeki, and to the puritans\r\nof Boston. Near this same mission of Sillery, Friar Liégeois was massacred\r\nby the Iroquois, whilst Father Poncet was carried away a captive by these\r\nbarbarous tribes.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur de Sillery devoted large sums to erect the necessary edifices\r\nfor the mission, such as a chapel, a missionary residence, an hospital, a\r\nfort, houses for the new converts, together with the habitations for the\r\nFrench. The D'Auteuil family had their country seat on the hill back of\r\nPointe à Puiseaux; and the venerable Madame de Monceau, the mother-in-law\r\nof the Attorney-General Ruette D'Auteuil, was in the habit of residing\r\nthere from time to time, in a house she had constructed near the chapel.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1643, Father Bressani having been taken prisoner by the Iroquois, and\r\nhaving heard them discuss a plan to seize on the white maidens of Sillery\r\n(such were the names the Nuns went by); wrote it on some bark, which a\r\nHuron Indian having found, took it to Governor Montmagny. The Governor\r\nthen organized a guard of six soldiers, who each day relieved one another\r\nat Sillery, to watch over the village--the incursions of the savages\r\nincreasing, the soldiers refused to remain any longer, and Governor\r\nMontmagny gave the Hospitalières the use of a small house on the beach of\r\nthe river in the lower town. (Hist. de l'Hôtel-Dieu, p. 50.)\r\n\r\nFrancis Parkman furnishes interesting details of the arrival of Piesharit,\r\na famous Indian chief, at Sillery in 1645, and of a grand council held by\r\ndeMontmagny, in the Jesuits House, which exists to this day, probably the\r\noldest structure of the kind in Canada, dating from 1637.\r\n\r\n\"As the successful warriors approached the little mission settlement of\r\nSillery, immediately above Quebec, they raised their song of triumph and\r\nbeat time with their paddles on the edges of their canoes; while, from\r\neleven poles raised aloft, eleven fresh scalps fluttered in the wind. The\r\nFather Jesuit and all his flock were gathered on the strand to welcome\r\nthem. The Indians fired three guns, and screeched in jubilation; one Jean\r\nBaptiste, a Christian chief of Sillery, made a speech from the shore;\r\nPisharet repeated, standing upright in his canoe, and to crown the\r\noccasion, a squad of soldiers, marching in haste from Quebec, fired a\r\nsalute of musketry, to the boundless delight of the Indians. Much to the\r\nsurprise of the two captives, there was no running of the gauntlet, no\r\ngnawing off of finger-nails or cutting off of fingers; but the scalps were\r\nhung, like little flags, over the entrance of the lodges, and all Sillery\r\nbetook itself to feasting and rejoicing. One old woman, indeed, came to\r\nthe Jesuit with a pathetic appeal. \"Oh, my father! let me caress these\r\nprisoners a little: they have killed, burned, and eaten my father, my\r\nhusband and my children.\" But the missionary answered with a lecture on\r\nthe duty of forgiveness.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, Montmagny came to Sillery and there was a grand council\r\nin the house of the Jesuits. Pisharet, in a solemn harangue, delivered his\r\ncaptives to the Governor, who replied with a speech of compliment and an\r\nample gift. The two Iroquois, were present, seated with a seeming\r\nimperturbability, but great anxiety of heart; and when at length they\r\ncomprehended that their lives were safe, one of them, a man of great size\r\nand symmetry, rose and addressed Montmagny.\" [191]\r\n\r\nIt would be indeed a pleasant and easy task to recall all the remarkable\r\nevents which occurred in this neighborhood. One thing is certain, the cool\r\nretreats studding the shores of the St. Lawrence were equally sought for\r\nby the wealthy in those days as they have been since by all those who wish\r\nto breathe pure air and enjoy the scenery.\r\n\r\nThe Sillery settlement commenced to be deserted about the beginning of the\r\nlast century. After the cession of Canada the care of the buildings was\r\nneglected, and they soon fell to ruins; but the residence of the\r\nmissionary fathers was preserved, and the ruins of the other structures\r\nremained standing long enough to be susceptible of identification with\r\ncertainty. Several of the old inhabitants recollect having seen the church\r\nwalls demolished, and they were of great solidity. Abbé Ferland himself,\r\ntwenty years ago, saw a portion of those walls standing above ground. The\r\nruins of the hospital and the convent were razed about fifty years ago,\r\nand in demolishing them several objects were discovered, some of which\r\nmust have belonged to the good ladies, the _Hospitalières_ nuns.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who might feel inclined to explore the remaining\r\nvestiges of M. Sillery's foundation, I shall furnish some details on the\r\nlocality. About the centre of Sillery Cove can be seen a cape, not very\r\nhigh, but with its sides perpendicular. The position of surrounding\r\nobjects point it out as the spot on which stood the fort intended to\r\nprotect the village; there also, in a dry soil, stood the cemetery, from\r\nwhich several bodies were exhumed in the course of last summer (1854) At\r\nthe foot of the cape, on your left, is the missionaries' house now\r\nconverted into a residence for the clerks of Messrs. E. R. Dobell & Co.\r\nThis building has been kept in repair, and is still in a good state of\r\npreservation. In a line with it, and nearest the St. Lawrence, can be\r\ndiscovered the foundation of the church. This edifice stood north-east and\r\nsouth-west.\r\n\r\nNear the wall closest to the river ran a spring of water, perfectly clear,\r\nand, no doubt, used for the wants of the church and of the presbytery.\r\nSeveral other streams of excellent water run down the hill and intersect\r\nthe grounds in all directions. No misconception can exist as to where the\r\nchapel stood, as there are still (in 1855) living several persons who saw\r\nthe walls standing, and can point out the foundations which have since\r\nbeen identified and enclosed by stone pillars and chains. To the right of\r\nthe small cape, and on a line with the chapel, stood the hospital, now\r\ndeserted for more than two centuries. Over its foundation an elm has\r\ngrown,--'tis now a handsome and large tree; six feet from the ground its\r\ncircumference measures two fathoms (12 feet), which makes its diameter\r\nabout three and a half. Heriot thus describes the locality in 1806:--\r\n\r\n\"From hence to Cap Rouge the scenery, on account of its beauty and\r\nvariety, attracts the attention of the passenger. At Sillery, a league\r\nfrom Quebec, on the north shore, are the ruins of an establishment which\r\nwas begun in 1637, intended as a religious institution for the conversion\r\nand instruction of natives of the country; it was at one time inhabited by\r\ntwelve French families. The buildings are placed upon level ground,\r\nsheltered by steep banks, and close by the borders of the river; they now\r\nonly consist of two old stone houses, fallen to decay, and of the remains\r\nof a small chapel (the chapel has of late been repaired and fitted up for\r\na malt house, and some of the other buildings have been converted into a\r\nbrewery). [192] In this vicinity the Algonquins once had a village;\r\nseveral of their tumuli, or burying places, are still discoverable in the\r\nwoods, and hieroglyphics cut on the trees remain, in some situations, yet\r\nunaffected.\" [193]\r\n\r\nOn the 6th June, 1865, we determined to afford ourselves a long-promised\r\ntreat, and go and survey, with Abbé Ferland's _Notes on Sillery_ open\r\nbefore us, and also the help of that eminently respected authority in\r\nevery parish, the \"oldest inhabitant,\" the traces of the Sillery\r\nsettlement of 1637. Nor had we long to wait before obtaining ocular\r\ndemonstration of the minute exactitude with which our old friend, the\r\nAbbé, had investigated and measured every stone, every crumbling remain of\r\nbrick and mortar. The first and most noticeable relic pointed out was the\r\nveritable house of the missionaries, facing the St. Lawrence, on the north\r\nside of the road, on Sillery Cove; it was the property of the late Henry\r\nLe Mesurier, Esquire, of Beauvoir. Were it in the range of possible events\r\nthat the good fathers could revisit the scene of their past apostolical\r\nlabours and view their former earthly tenement, hard would be the task to\r\nidentify it. The heavy three-feet-thick wall is there yet, as perfect, as\r\nmassive, as defiant as ever; the pointed gable and steep roof, in spite of\r\nalterations, still stands--the true index of an old French structure in\r\nCanada. Our forefathers seemed as if they never could make the roof of a\r\ndwelling steep enough, doubtless to prevent the accumulation of snow. But\r\nhere ends all analogy with the past; so jaunty, so cosy, so modern does\r\nthe front and interior of Sillery \"Manor House\" look--thus styled for many\r\nyears past. Paint, paper and furniture have made it quite a snug abode.\r\nNor was it without a certain peculiar feeling of reverence we, for the\r\nfirst time, crossed that threshold, and entered beneath those fortress-\r\nlike walls, where for years had resounded the orisons of the Jesuit\r\nFathers, the men from whose ranks were largely recruited our heroic band\r\nof early martyrs--some of whose dust, unburied, but not unhonoured, has\r\nmingled for two centuries with its parent earth on the green banks of Lake\r\nSimcoe, on the borders of the Ohio, in the environs of Kingston, Montreal,\r\nThree Rivers, Quebec--a fruitful seed of christianity scattered\r\nbountifully through the length and breadth of our land; others, whose\r\nlifeless clay still rests in yon sunny hillock in the rear, to the west of\r\nthe \"Manor House\"--the little cemetery described by Abbé Ferland. Between\r\nthe \"Manor House\" and the river, about forty feet from the house,\r\ninclining towards the south, are the remains of the foundation walls of\r\nthe Jesuit's church or chapel, dating back to 1640. On the 13th June,\r\n1657, fire made dreadful havoc in the residence of the Jesuits\r\n(_Relations_, for 1657, p. 26); they stand north-east and south-west,\r\nand are at present flush with the greensward; a large portion of them were\r\nstill visible about thirty-five years ago, as, attested by many living\r\nwitnesses; they were converted into ballast for ships built at this spot,\r\nand into materials for repairing the main road by some Vandal who will\r\nremain nameless. From the Manor House you notice the little cape to the\r\nsouth-west mentioned in Abbé Ferland's _Notes_, though growing smaller and\r\nsmaller every year from the quantities of soil and stone taken from it,\r\nalso to repair the road. The large elm pointed out by the Abbé as having\r\ngrown over the spot where the hospital stood is there yet, a majestic\r\ntree. The selection of a site for the little cemetery is most judicious,\r\nseveral little streams from the heights in the rear filter through the\r\nground, producing a moisture calculated to prevent decomposition and\r\nexplanatory of the singular appearance of the bodies disinterred there in\r\n1855. Every visitor will be struck with the beauty, healthiness and\r\nshelter which this sequestered nook at Sillery presents for a settlement,\r\nand with its adaptability for the purposes for which it was chosen, being\r\nquite protected against our two prevailing winds, the north-east and\r\nsouth-west, with a warm southern exposure.\r\n\r\nMany years after the opening of the Algonquin and Montagnais school at\r\nSillery, the Huron Indians, after being relentlessly tracked by their\r\ninveterate foes, the Five Nations, divided into five detachments; one of\r\nthese hid on the Great Manitoulin Island, others elsewhere; a portion came\r\ndown to Quebec on the 26th July, 1650, [194] under the direction of Father\r\nRagueneau, and, on the 28th July, 1650, settled first on the Jesuits land\r\nat Beauport; in March, 1651, they went to _Ance du Fort_, on the lands of\r\nMademoiselle de Grandmaison, on the Island of Orleans. But the Iroquois\r\nhaving scented their prey in their new abode, made a raid on the island,\r\nbutchered seventy-one of them, and carried away some prisoners. The\r\nunfortunate redskins soon left the Island in dismay, and for protection,\r\nencamped in the city of Quebec itself, under the cannon of the fort,\r\nconstructed by Governor d'Aillebout to receive them, near the Jesuits\r\nCollege (at Cote de St. Michel); in 1667, they settled on the northerly\r\nfrontier of Sillery, [195] in Notre Dame de Foy [now St. Foye]; restless\r\nand scared, they again shifted they quarters on the 29th December, 1693,\r\nand pitched their erratic tents at Ancienne Lorette, which place they also\r\nabandoned many years afterwards to go and settle at _Jeune_ or Indian\r\nLorette, where the remnants of this once warlike race [196] (the _nobles_\r\namongst Indian tribes) exist, now crossed with their Caucasian brethren,\r\nand vegetate in obscurity--exotic trees transplanted far from their native\r\nwilds.\r\n\r\nShall we venture to assert that Sillery equals in size some of the German\r\nprincipalities, and that, important though it be, like European dynasties,\r\nit has had its periods of splendor succeeded by eras of medieval\r\nobscurity. From 1700 down to the time of the conquest, we appeal in vain\r\nto the records of the past for any historical event connected with it;\r\neverywhere reigns supreme a Cimmerian darkness. But if the page of history\r\nis silent, the chronicles of the _ton_ furnish some tit-bits of drawing-\r\nroom chit-chat. Thus, as stated in Hawkins' celebrated _Historical Picture\r\nof Quebec_, [197] the northern portion of the parish skirting the St. Foye\r\nroad \"was the favorite drive of the Canadian belle.\" In these few words,\r\nof Hawkins is involved an intricate question for the salons, a problem to\r\nsolve, more abstruse than the one which agitated the Grecian cities\r\nrespecting the birth of Homer. Who then was the Canadian Belle of former\r\ndays? The Nestors of the present generation still speak with admiration of\r\na fascinating stranger who, close to the end of the last century, used to\r\ndrive on the St. Foye road, when a royal duke lived in the city, in what\r\nis now styled \"The Kent House,\" on St. Louis street. The name of this\r\ndistinguished traveller, a lady of European birth, was Madame St. Laurent;\r\nbut, kind reader, have patience. The Canadian belle who thus enjoyed her\r\ndrives in the environs of Quebec was not Madame St. Laurent, as it is\r\ndistinctly stated at page 170 of Hawkins that this occurred before the\r\nconquest, viz., 1759. Might it have been that vision of female loveliness,\r\nthat spotless and beautiful Mrs. De Léry, whose presentation at court,\r\nwith her handsome husband, shortly after the conquest, elicited from His\r\nMajesty George III. the expression which history has preserved, \"If such\r\nare all my new Canadian subjects, I have indeed made a conquest;\" or must\r\nwe picture to ourselves as the Canadian belle that peerless beauty, that\r\nwitty and aspiring Madame Hughes Pean, Intendant Bigot's fair charmer,\r\nmysteriously hinted at, in all the old Quebec guide books, as \"Mrs.\r\nP----.\" Madame Hughes Pean, [198] whose husband was Town Major of Quebec,\r\nowned a seigniory in the vicinity of the city--some say at St. Vallier,\r\nwhere Mons Pean used to load with corn the vessels he dispatched\r\nelsewhere; she also was one of the gay revellers at the romantic\r\nHermitage, Bigot's shooting lodge at Charlesbourg. Old memoirs seem to\r\nfavour this version. Be this as it may the St. Foy road was a favorite\r\ndrive even a century before the present day; so says Hawkins' historical\r\nwork on Quebec--no mean authority, considering that the materials thereof\r\nwere furnished by that accomplished scholar and eminent barrister, the\r\nlate Andrew Stuart, father of the present Judge Stuart, and compiled by\r\nthe late Dr. John Charlton Fisher, one of the able joint editors of the\r\nNew York _Albion_, and father of Mrs. Ed. Burstall, late of Sillery. Who\r\nwas the reigning belle in 1759, we confess that all our antiquarian lore\r\nhas failed to satisfactorily unravel. The battles of 1759 and 1760 have\r\nrendered Sillery, St. Foye, and the Plains of Abraham classic ground. The\r\ndetails of these events, having appeared elsewhere, [199] the reader is\r\nreferred to them.\r\n\r\nThose of the present day desirous to ascertain the exact spot in the\r\nenvirons of Quebec where past events have taken place, ought to be careful\r\nnot to be misled by subsequent territorial divisions for municipal or\r\ncanonical purposes. Many may not be aware that our forefathers included\r\nunder the denomination of Abraham's Heights that plateau of comparatively\r\nlevel ground extending in a south-easterly direction from the _Coteau\r\nSte. Geneviève_ towards the lofty banks which line the River St.\r\nLawrence, covering the greatest part of the land on which subsequently\r\nhave been built the St. Lewis and St. John's suburbs, the hilly portion\r\ntowards the city and river, where stands the Asile Champêtre; thence\r\nsouth-east, being then called Buttes à Nepveu; the land close by, between\r\nthe Plains and Pointe à Puiseaux, as Côte St. Michael; the ascent from the\r\nvalley of the St. Charles towards this plateau was through the hill known\r\nas Côte d'Abraham. The locality afterwards known as Woodfield and Spencer\r\nWood, in the fief of St. Michael, was designated as the wood of Sames,\r\nthus called after a celebrated French ecclesiastic of Quebec, Bishop\r\nDosquet, who owned there a country seat in 1753--then known as Sames--\r\nlater on, as Woodfield. To the west lay the Gomin Wood--which had taken\r\nits name from a French botanist, Dr. Gomin, who had located himself on\r\nland on which it is said, Coulonge Cottage was subsequently built in order\r\nto study the Flora of Sillery, which is very varied and rich.\r\n\r\nThe old Sillery settlement, which lay within the limits of the parish of\r\nSte. Foye, was, in 1855, placed under the distinguished tutelage of a\r\nSaint, dear to those who hail from the Emerald Isle, and called St.\r\nColumba of Sillery. Thus the realms heretofore sacred to the Archangel,\r\nSt. Michael and to St. Joseph, have peaceably passed under the gentle sway\r\nof St. Columba, despite the law of prescription. The British residents of\r\nSillery--and this ought to console sticklers for English precedents and\r\nthe sacredness of vested rights--did not permit the glory of the Archangel\r\nto depart, and soon after the erection of St. Columbia into a parish, the\r\nhandsome temple of worship called St. Michael's church, came into\r\nexistence. [200]\r\n\r\n\r\n_OUR COUNTRY SEATS._\r\n\r\nIn the preceding paper a general sketch has been attempted of that portion\r\nof the St. Lawrence highlands adjoining Quebec to the west--a locality\r\nremarkable for the numerous residences it contains of \"the nobility of\r\ncommerce,\" as a contemporary facetiously styles our merchants. We shall,\r\nin the following go over a great portion of the same ground, delineating,\r\nfirst the land area west of Quebec proper, where was fought the battle of\r\nthe 13th Sept., 1759, _the Plains or Abraham_, and next detail,\r\nspecifically, the most attractive of these country residences, enlarging\r\nour canvass, however, so as to comprise also descriptions of rural homes\r\nbeyond the limits of Sillery. Many other abodes we would also desire to\r\ntake in these pages, but space precludes it. It is hoped we won't be\r\nmisunderstood in our literary project: far is it from our intention to\r\nwrite a panegyric of individuals or a paean to success, although sketches\r\nof men or domestic recollections may frequently find their place in the\r\ndescription of their abodes. No other desire prompted us but that of\r\nattempting to place prominently before the public the spots with which\r\nhistory or nature has more specially enriched Quebec. Quebecers ought to\r\nbe proud of their scenery and of the historical ivy which clings to the\r\nold walls of Stadacona. Neighbouring cities may grow vast with brick and\r\nmortar; their commerce may advance with the stride of a young giant; their\r\ncitizens may sit in high places among the sons of men, but can they ever\r\ncompare with our own fortress for historical memories or beautiful\r\nscenery? We shall assign the first place to the mansion which still crowns\r\nthe Montmorenci Falls, once the abode of the father of our Sovereign; we\r\nshall then view the residences on the St. Lewis road in succession, then\r\nthose along the St. Foy road, and finally close this paper with the\r\ndescription of other remarkable spots in the neighborhood of Quebec.--\r\nLorette, Château Bigot, Montmorency Falls, Chaudière Falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE PLAINS OF ABRAHAM._\r\n\r\n    \"Aux plaines d'Abraham, rendez-vous des batailles, revenez voir ces\r\n    lieux, oh! revenez encore, officiers du _Grand Roi_, revenez tous\r\n    aussi, La Barre, Frontenac, Denonville, Tracy! alignez vous, soldats,\r\n    Carignan et Guienne, appuyez, Languedoc et Béarn et la Reine.\"--\r\n    _Alp. de Puibusque_.\r\n\r\n   \"Among modern Battle-fields,\" says Col. (now Lt. General) Beatson,\r\n    \"none surpass in romantic interest the Plains or Heights of Abraham.\"\r\n\r\nNo Quebecer would have the hardihood to challenge the assertion of this\r\nable engineer officer, stationed here from 1849 to 1854, and who spared\r\nneither time nor pains, with the assistance of our historians and\r\nantiquarians, Ferland, Faribault and McGuire, to collect authentic\r\ninformation on this subject. Col. Beatson compiled a volume of historical\r\nnotes, which he published in 1858, when stationed at Gibraltar. [201]\r\n\r\nThe Plains of Abraham will ever be famous, as having witnessed, more than\r\none century back, the deadly encounter of the then two leading nations of\r\nEurope--England and France--to decide the fate of Canada--one might say\r\n(by the series of events it led to) the destinies of North America.\r\n\r\nOf this mighty duel, which crimsoned with human gore these fields one\r\nmurky September morning, in 1759--Smollett, Carlyle, Bancroft, Hawkins,\r\nSmith, Garneau, Ferland, Miles and other historians have vied with one\r\nanother to furnish a graphic account. Of the origin of the name, none\r\nuntil lately could tell.\r\n\r\n    \"Notwithstanding,\" adds Col. Beatson, \"the world-like celebrity of\r\n    these Plains, it was not until very recently that the derivation of\r\n    their name was discovered; and as it is comparatively unknown, even in\r\n    Canada, the following explanation of its origin will doubtless possess\r\n    attractions for such as are fond of tracing to their sources the names\r\n    of celebrated localities, and who may be surprised to learn that\r\n    upwards of a century previous to the final conquest of Canada by the\r\n    British arms, the scene of the decisive struggle for national\r\n    supremacy in the northern division of the New World had derived its\r\n    name from one who, if not a Scotchman by birth, would seem to have\r\n    been of Scottish lineage. This apparently improbable fact will,\r\n    however, appear less extraordinary when it is known that he was a sea-\r\n    faring man; and when it is considered how close was the alliance and\r\n    how frequent the intercourse which, for centuries before that period,\r\n    had subsisted between France and Scotland.\r\n\r\n    \"This individual, whose name was Abraham Martin, is described in a\r\n    legal document, dated the 15th August, 1646, and preserved among the\r\n    archives of the Bishop's Palace, at Quebec, as (the King's) Pilot of\r\n    the St. Lawrence; an appointment which probably conferred on its\r\n    possessor considerable official rank; for we find that Jacques\r\n    Quartier, or Cartier, the enterprising discoverer and explorer of the\r\n    St. Lawrence, when about to proceed in 1540, on his third voyage to\r\n    Canada, was appointed by Francis I, Captain General and Master Pilot\r\n    of the expedition which consisted of four vessels.\r\n\r\n    \"That Martin was a person of considerable importance in the then\r\n    infant colony of New France may also be inferred from the fact that,\r\n    in the journal of the Jesuits and in the parish register of Quebec, he\r\n    is usually designated by his Christian name only, Maître Abraham; as\r\n    well as from the circumstance of Champlain, the distinguished founder\r\n    of Quebec and father of New France, having been god-father to one of\r\n    Abraham's daughters (Hélène) and of Charles de St. Etienne, Sieur de\r\n    la Tour, of Acadian celebrity, having stood in the same relation to\r\n    Martin's youngest son, Charles Amador.\r\n\r\n    \"The earliest mention of Martin's name occurs in the first entry of\r\n    the parish register of Quebec, viz., on, the 24th of October, 1621;\r\n    when his son Eustache, who died shortly afterwards, was baptized by\r\n    father Denis, a Franciscan Friar. The second baptism therein recorded\r\n    is that of his daughter Marguerite, which took place in 1624; and it\r\n    is stated in the register that these children were born of the\r\n    legitimate marriage of Abraham Martin surnamed or usually known as\r\n    _the Scot_ (\"dict l'Ecossois.\") Their family was numerous; besides\r\n    Anne and other children previously to the opening of the register in\r\n    1621, the baptism of the following are therein recorded:--\r\n\r\n      Eustache,................ \\           / 1621.\r\n      Marguerite,.............. |           | 1624.\r\n      Marie,................... |           | 1627.\r\n      Adrien,.................. |  Born in  | 1635.\r\n      Madelaine,............... |           | 1640.\r\n      Barbe (Barbara),......... |           | 1643.\r\n      Charles Amador,.......... /           \\ 1648.\r\n\r\n    who was the second Canadian raised to the priesthood, and became a\r\n    canon at the erection of the chapter of Quebec.\"\r\n\r\nAs the reader will observe there is nothing to connect the Plains with\r\nthat of the patriarch of Genesis. Nay, though our Scotch friend owned a\r\nfamily patriarchal in extent, on referring to The Jesuits' Journal we\r\nfind, we regret to way, at page 120 an Entry, according to which the\r\n\"Ancient Mariner\" seems to have been very summarily dealt with; in fact\r\ncommitted to prison for a delinquency involving the grossest immorality.\r\nThe appellation of Plains of Abraham was formerly given by our historians\r\nto that extensive plateau stretching from the city walls to the Sillery\r\nWood, bounded to the north by the heights of land overhanging the valley\r\nof the St. Charles, and to the south by the _coin du cap_ overlooking\r\nthe St. Lawrence, whose many indentures form coves or timber berths, for\r\nstoring square timber, &c., studded with deep water wharves.\r\n\r\nThe hill in St. John suburbs or ascent leading up from the valley of the\r\nSt. Charles, where St. Roch has since been built to the table-land above,\r\nwas from time immemorial known as COTE D'ABRAHAM, Abraham's Hill. Why did\r\nit bear that name?\r\n\r\nOn referring to the Parish Register of Quebec, from 1621 to 1700, one\r\nindividual seems to have borne the name of Abraham, and that person is\r\nAbraham Martin, to whom under the appellation of _Maître_ Abraham,\r\nrepeated reference is made both in the Register and the Jesuits' Journal.\r\n\r\nAbraham Martin, according to the documents quoted by Col. Beatson, owned\r\nin two separate lots--one of twenty and the other of twelve\r\n_arpents_--thirty-two _arpents_ of land, covering, as appears by the\r\nsubjoined Plan or Diagram copied from his work, a great portion of the\r\nsite on which St. John and St. Louis Suburbs have since been erected.\r\nAbraham's property occupied, it would seem, a portion of the area--the\r\nnorthern section--which, for a long period, also went under the name of\r\nAbraham's Plains. It adjoined other land of the Ursuline Ladies then owned\r\non _Côteau St. Louis_, closer to the city, when 1667, [202] it was\r\npurchased by them; at that time, the whole tract, according to Col.\r\nBeatson, went under the general name of Plains of Abraham. Such appear to\r\nbe the results of recent researches on this once very obscure question.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE BATTLE FIELD._\r\n\r\nTwo highways, lined with country seats, forest trees or cornfields run\r\nparallel, at a distance varying from one to half a mile, leading into\r\nQuebec: the _Grande Allée_, or St. Louis and the Ste. Foye road. They\r\nintersect from east to west the expanse, nine miles in length, from _Cap\r\nRouge_ to the city. These well known chief arteries of travel were solidly\r\nmacadamized in 1841. At the western point, looms out the oak and pine clad\r\ncliffs of a lofty cape--_Cap Rouge_ or _Redclyffe_. Here wintered, in\r\n1541-2, the discoverer of Canada, Cartier and his followers, here, in\r\n1543-4, his celebrated follower, Roberval, seems also to have sojourned\r\nduring the dreary months of winter.\r\n\r\nA small stream, at the foot of the cape, meanders in a north westerly\r\ndirection through St. Augustin and neighbouring parishes, forming a deep\r\nvalley all around the cape. The conformation of the land has led\r\ngeologists to infer that, at some remote period, the plateau, extending to\r\nQuebec, must have been surrounded on all sides by water, the _Cap Rouge_\r\nstream and St. Charles being the outlets on the west, north and east. This\r\narea increases in altitude until it reaches the lofty summit of Cape\r\nDiamond, its eastern boundary. Nature itself seems to have placed these\r\nrugged heights as an insurmountable barrier to invasion from the St.\r\nLawrence. With the walls, bastion and heavy city guns; with artillery in\r\nposition on the _Cap Rouge_ promontory; cavalry patrolling the Sillery\r\nheights; a numerous army on the only accessible portion of the coast--\r\nBeauport, Quebec, if succoured in time, was tolerably safe; so thought\r\nsome of the French engineers, though not Montcalm.\r\n\r\n    \"The two engagements,\" says Chauveau, \"that of the 15th September,\r\n    1759, and that of the 28th of April, 1760, occupied nearly all the\r\n    plateau hereinbefore described. The first, however, it would seem, was\r\n    fought chiefly on the St. Louis road, whilst the second took place on\r\n    the Ste. Foye road. Each locality has its monument, one erected in the\r\n    honour of Wolfe, on the identical spot where he fell; the other in\r\n    1855, to commemorate the glorious fate of the combatants of 1760,\r\n    where the carnage was the thickest, viz: on the site where stood\r\n    Dumont's mill (a few yards to the east of the dwelling of J. W.\r\n    Dunscomb, Esq.)\r\n\r\n    \"The victory of 1759 was a fitting reward of Wolfe's valour, punished\r\n    the infamies of the Bigot _régime_ and withdrew Canada from the\r\n    focus of the terrible chastisement which awaited France soon after--in\r\n    the Reign of Terror--for her impiety and immorality. The victory of\r\n    April, 1760, was a comforting incident--a species of compensation to a\r\n    handful of brave and faithful colonists, for the crushing disaster\r\n    which had befallen their cause, the preceding September. It was the\r\n    crowning--though bootless victory--to the recent brilliant, but\r\n    useless success of the French arms at Carillon, Monongahela, Fort\r\n    George, Ticonderoga, Beauport Flats. It was, moreover, the last title,\r\n    added to numerous others, to the esteem and respect of their\r\n    conquerors.\"\r\n\r\nOf the second battle of the Plains, that of 28th April 1760, called by\r\nsome writers \"The battle of Ste. Foye,\" by others \"The battle of Sillery\r\nWood,\" so bloody in its results, so protracted in its duration, we have in\r\n_Garneau's History_ the first complete account, the historian Smith\r\nhaving glossed over with striking levity this \"French victory.\" The loss\r\nof the rival Generals, at the battle of the Plains, of September, 1759,\r\nthough an unusual incident in warfare, was not without precedent Generals\r\nBraddock and DeBeaujeu in 1755, had both sealed on the battlefield their\r\ndevotion to their country with their blood on the shores of the\r\nMonongahela, in Ohio; in this case as in that of Wolfe and Montcalm, he\r\nwhose arms were to prevail, falling first.\r\n\r\nIn 1759, everything conspired to transform this conflict into an important\r\nhistorical event. Even after the lapse of a century, one sometimes is fain\r\nto believe, it sums up all which Europe recollects of primitive Canada.\r\nThe fall of Quebec did not merely bring to a close the fierce rivalry of\r\nFrance and England in America. It lent an immense prestige to Great\r\nBritain, by consolidating her maritime supremacy over France--a supremacy\r\nshe then so highly prized. The event, after the discouraging news which\r\nhad prevailed, was heralded all over England by the ringing of the bells,\r\nand public thanksgiving. Bonfires blazed through the length and breadth of\r\nthe land, it was a national victory which King, Peers and Commons could\r\nnot sufficiently extol, and still what has been the ultimate result? By\r\nremoving the French power from Canada--the only counterpoise to keep down\r\nthe restless and thriving New England colonies, New England, from being\r\nstrong got to be defiant. The surrender of Canada hastened the American\r\nRevolution. The rule of Britain soon ceased to exist in the New England\r\nProvinces; and later on, in 1810, by the abrogation of the right of search\r\non the high seas, her maritime supremacy became a dead letter. As Mr.\r\nChauveau has remarked, \"if the independence of America meant the lessening\r\nof the British prestige, it remains yet to be proved that France has\r\nbenefitted thereby.\"\r\n\r\nHow much of these momentous changes can be traced to the incidents\r\n(perhaps the treason of Bigot), [203] which made the scale of victory\r\nincline to British valour on the 13th of September, 1759!\r\n\r\nThose desirous of obtaining a full account of the two battles of the\r\nPlains are referred among other works, to \"Quebec Past and Present.\" I\r\nshall merely borrow from Col. Beatson's very rare volume details not to be\r\nfound in the ordinary histories.\r\n\r\n    \"It has,\" says Col Beatson, \"been alleged that Montcalm in hastening\r\n    to meet the British on an open plain, and thereby to decide in a\r\n    single battle, the fate of a fertile Province nearly equal in extent\r\n    to one-half of Europe, was not only forgetful of his usual caution,\r\n    but acted with culpable temerity.\"\r\n\r\n    Such action, however, proceeded from no sudden impulse, but from a\r\n    noble resolve deliberately formed after the most mature consideration\r\n    and recorded some time previously.\r\n\r\n    Painfully convinced how little security the weak defences of the city\r\n    could afford against the determined assault of well disciplined and\r\n    ably led troops, he believed that however great the risk of meeting\r\n    his daring adversary in the open field, this course was the only one\r\n    that seemed to promise him any chance of success. Besides, he had a\r\n    force numerically [204] superior to that of the English General, could\r\n    he have concentrated them at one spot. Bougainville with the flower of\r\n    the French army, the grenadiers and volunteers, 3,000 strong,\r\n    according to professor Dussieux, was at Cap Rouge, six miles from the\r\n    battlefield and took no part in the fight, having arrived there more\r\n    than one hour after the fate of Canada was decided. 1,500 men had been\r\n    left at the Beauport camp to repel the feint by Admiral Saunders'\r\n    ships, on the morning of the 13 Sept., 1759. The Charlesbourg, Lorette\r\n    and Beauport militia had been granted leave to return home that week,\r\n    to look after their harvest: a curious coincidence.\r\n\r\n    The French army was as follows, viz:\r\n  Left  | The Royal Roussillon Regiment, a battalion  Regulars. Militia.\r\n  Wing  | of the marines, or colony troops, and\r\n        | Canadian militia...........................    1,300    2,300\r\n  Centre.--The Regiments of Béarn and militia. ......      720    1,200\r\n  Right | The Regiments of La Sarre and Languedoc,\r\n  Wing  | a battalion of the marine, and militia.....    1,600      400\r\n                                                         -----    -----\r\n                                                         3,620    3,900\r\n\r\n    Wolfe's _field-state_ on the morning of the 13th September, showed\r\n    only 4,828 men of all ranks, from the General downwards; but of these\r\n    every man was a trained soldier.\r\n\r\n    And within little more than an hour's march from the Plains, he could\r\n    not honourably have remained inactive while believing that only a part\r\n    of the enemy's force was in possession of such vantage ground; and\r\n    neither the dictates of prudence [205] nor his own chivalrous spirit\r\n    and loyal regard for the national honour, would permit him to betray a\r\n    consciousness of weakness by declining the combat, on finding himself\r\n    unexpectedly confronted by the whole of Wolfe's army. Relying,\r\n    doubtless, on the prestige of his victories during the campaign of the\r\n    proceeding year (1758) in which he had been uniformly successful, and\r\n    in which at Ticonderoga, with four thousand men he had defeated\r\n    General Abercromby at the head of nearly four times that number--he\r\n    endeavoured by a confident bearing and encouraging expressions [206]\r\n    to animate his troops with hopes which he himself could scarcely\r\n    entertain; and though almost despairing of success, boldly resolved to\r\n    attempt, by a sudden and vigorous onset, to dislodge his rival before\r\n    the latter could intrench himself in his commanding position, and it\r\n    is surely no blot on his fame that the superior discipline and\r\n    unflinching steadiness of his opponents, the close and destructive\r\n    volley [207] by which the spirited but disorderly advance of his\r\n    battalions was checked, and the irresistible [208] charge which\r\n    completed their confusion, rendered unavailing his gallant effort to\r\n    save the colony; for (to borrow the words of the eloquent historian of\r\n    the _Peninsular War_), \"the vicissitudes of war are so many that\r\n    disappointment will sometimes attend the wisest combinations; and a\r\n    ruinous defeat, the work of chance close the career of the boldest and\r\n    most sagacious of Generals, so that to judge a commander's conduct by\r\n    the event alone is equally unjust and unphilosophical.\"\r\n\r\n    In the remarkable letter said to have been addressed to his cousin, M.\r\n    de Molé, _Président au Parlement de Paris_, and dated _from the camp\r\n    before Quebec, 22nd August_, 1759,\"--a fortnight before the battle--\r\n    MONTCALM thus pathetically describes how hopeless would be the\r\n    situation in the event of WOLFE effecting a landing near the city;\r\n    and, with a firm heart, foretold his own fate,\r\n\r\n    \"Here I am, my dear cousin, after the lapse of more than three months\r\n    still contending with Mr. WOLFE, who has incessantly bombarded Quebec\r\n    with a fury unexampled in the attack of any place, which the besieger\r\n    has wished to retain after his capture.\r\n\r\n    \"Nearly all the whole of Lower Town has been destroyed by his\r\n    batteries and of the Upper Town a great part is likewise in ruins. But\r\n    even if he leaves not one stone upon another, he will never obtain\r\n    possession of the capital of the colony whilst his operations continue\r\n    to be confined to the opposite side of the river.\r\n\r\n    \"Notwithstanding all his efforts during these three months, be has\r\n    hitherto made no progress towards the accomplishment of his object. He\r\n    is ruining us, but without advantage to himself. The campaign can\r\n    scarcely last another month, in consequence of the approach of the\r\n    autumnal gales, which are so severe and so disastrous to shipping.\r\n\r\n    \"It may seem that, after so favourable a prelude, the safety of the\r\n    colony can scarcely be doubtful. Such, however, is not the case, as\r\n    the capture of Quebec depends on a _coup-de-main_. The English have\r\n    entire command of the river, and have only to effect a landing on this\r\n    side, where the city without defences is situated. Imagine them in a\r\n    position to offer me battle! _which I could no longer decline, and\r\n    which I ought not to gain_.\r\n\r\n    \"Indeed, if M. WOLFE understands his business he has only to receive\r\n    my first fire, give a volley in return, and then charge; when my\r\n    Canadians--undisciplined, deaf to the sound of the drum, and thrown\r\n    into confusion by his onset--would be incapable of resuming their\r\n    ranks. Moreover, as they have no bayonets with which to oppose those\r\n    of the enemy, nothing would remain for them but flight; and then--\r\n    behold me beaten without resource.\r\n\r\n    \"Conceive my situation! a most painful one for a General-in-Chief, and\r\n    which causes me many distressing moments.\r\n\r\n    \"Hitherto, I have been enabled to act successfully on the defensive;\r\n    but will a continuance in that course prove ultimately successful?\r\n    that is the question which events must decide! Of this, however, you\r\n    may rest assured, that I shall probably not survive the loss of the\r\n    colony. There are circumstances which leave to a General no choice but\r\n    that of dying with honour; such may soon be my fate; and I trust that\r\n    in this respect posterity will have no cause to reproach my memory.\"\r\n    [209]\r\n\r\n    MONTCALM, conspicuous in front of the left wing of his line, and\r\n    WOLFE, at the head of the 28th Regiment, and the Louisbourg\r\n    Grenadiers, towards the right of the British line, must have been\r\n    nearly opposite to each other at the commencement of the battle, which\r\n    was most severe in that part of the field; and, by a singular\r\n    coincidence each of these heroic leaders had been twice wounded during\r\n    the brief conflict before he received his last and fatal wound.\r\n\r\n    But the valiant Frenchman, regardless of pain, relaxed not his efforts\r\n    to rally his broken battalions in their hurried retreat towards the\r\n    city, until he was shot through the loins, when within a few yards of\r\n    the St. Louis Gate. And so invincible was his fortitude that not even\r\n    the severity of this mortal stroke could abate his gallant spirit or\r\n    alter his intrepid bearing. Supported by two grenadiers--one at each\r\n    side of his horse--he re-entered the city; and in reply to some woman\r\n    who, on seeing blood flow from his wounds as he rode down St. Louis\r\n    street, on his way to the château, [210] exclaimed, _Oh, mon Dieu!\r\n    mon Dieu! le marquis est tué!_ courteously assured them that he was\r\n    not seriously hurt, and beg them not to distress themselves on his\r\n    account. _Ce n'est rien! Ce n'est rien! Ne vous affligez pas pour\r\n    moi, mes bonnes amies._ The last words of WOLFE--imperishably\r\n    enshrined in history--excite, after the lapse of a century, the\r\n    liveliest admiration and sympathy, and similar interest may, perhaps\r\n    be awakened by the narrative of the closing scene in the eventful\r\n    career of his great opponent.\r\n\r\n    On the 24th of March, 1761, the French troops who had served in Canada\r\n    under Montcalm, through M de Bougainville, applied to the British\r\n    Government for leave to raise a monument to the illustrious dead hero.\r\n    The British Government, through Mr. Pitt, sent back to Paris on the\r\n    10th April, 1761, a graceful letter of acquiescence. The inscription\r\n    had been prepared by the _Académie des Inscriptions et Belles\r\n    Lettres_. Unfortunately the marble on which the inscription was\r\n    engraved by some cause or other never reached Canada. However, in\r\n    1831, Lord Aylmer erected over the tomb of the marquis, in the\r\n    Ursuline Convent, a simple mural tablet of white marble, having the\r\n    following concise and beautiful epitaph from his Excellency's own\r\n    pen--\r\n\r\n                               HONNEUR\r\n                                  à\r\n                              MONTCALM\r\n               Le Destin en lui dérobant la Victoire\r\n               L'a récompensé par une mort glorieuse.\r\n\r\n    In the course of the following year (1832), there was also erected by\r\n    his Lordship a small monument on the battle-field to indicate the spot\r\n    where WOLFE expired, which structure, having become injured, has since\r\n    given place to a pedestal and column about thirty-five feet high,\r\n    surmounted by a Roman helmet wreathed with a laurel, and sword; both\r\n    in bronze.\r\n\r\n    On two sides of the pedestal are inserted bronze panels, with\r\n    inscriptions cast in bold relief; one of which thus briefly records\r\n    the place, circumstances, and date of the conquering hero's death:\r\n\r\n                             Here Died\r\n                               WOLFE\r\n                            Victorious\r\n                      September the 13th, 1759.\r\n\r\n    The other is as follows:\r\n\r\n                        \"This pillar was erected\r\n               By the British Army in Canada, A.D. 1849;\r\n               His Excellency Lieut.-General Sir Benjamin\r\n                                d'Urban,\r\n                      G.C.B.; K.C.H.; K.C.T.S., &c.,\r\n                        Commander of the Forces,\r\n             To replace that erected by Governor-General\r\n                         Lord Aylmer, G.C.B.,\r\n            Which was broken and defaced, and is deposited\r\n                              underneath.\r\n\r\n    From the foregoing, all admit that the Plains of Abraham must recall\r\n    memories equally sacred to both nationalities inhabiting Quebec.\r\n\r\n    The 13th September, 1759, and the 28th April, 1760, are two red-letter\r\n    days in our annals; the undying names of Wolfe and Montcalm claim the\r\n    first, the illustrious names of Levis and Murray, the second.\r\n\r\n    In the September engagement Montcalm's right wing rested on the Ste.\r\n    Foye road; his left on the St. Louis road, near the Buttes-à-Nepveu\r\n    (Perrault's Hill.)\r\n\r\n    In the April encounter, Murray's hardy warriors occupied the greatest\r\n    portion of the north-western section of the plateau. His right wing\r\n    rested on Coteau Ste. Genevieve, St. John Suburbs, and his left\r\n    reached to the edge of the cliff, overhanging the St Lawrence, near\r\n    Marchmont. On the 13th September, the French began the fight; on the\r\n    28th April it was the British who fired first. Fifteen years later, in\r\n    1775, the Heights of Abraham became the camping ground of other foes.\r\n    This time the British of New England were pitted against the British\r\n    of New France; we all know with what result.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _BATTLEFIELD PARK._\r\n\r\n    The departure from our shores of England's red coated legions, in\r\n    1871, amongst other voids, left waste, untenanted, and unoccupied, the\r\n    historic area, for close on one century reserved as their parade and\r\n    exercising grounds on review days--The Plains of Abraham. This famous\r\n    battle-field does not, we opine, belong to Quebec alone; it is the\r\n    common property of all Canada. The military authorities always so\r\n    careful in keeping its fences in repair handed it over to the\r\n    Dominion, which made no provision for this purpose. On the 9th March,\r\n    1875, the Dominion Government leased it to the Corporation of the city\r\n    of Quebec, for ten years of the lease under which it was held from the\r\n    Religious Ladies of the Ursulines of Quebec, provided the Corporation\r\n    assumed the conditions of the lease, involving an annual rental of two\r\n    hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n    The extensive conflagration of June 1876, which laid waste one-half of\r\n    St. Louis Suburbs, and the consequent impoverished state of the\r\n    municipal finances prevented the City authorities from voting any\r\n    money to maintain in proper order the fences of the Plains. Decay,\r\n    ruin and disorder were fast settling on this sacred ground, once\r\n    moistened by the blood of heroes, when the citizens of Quebec\r\n    spontaneously came to the rescue. No plan suggested to raise the\r\n    necessary funds obtained more favour than that of planting it with\r\n    some shade-trees, and converting it into a Driving Park. This idea\r\n    well carried out would, in a measure, associate it with the everyday\r\n    life of all citizens of all denominations. Its souvenir, its wondrous\r\n    river-views alone would attract thousands. It would be open\r\n    _gratis_ to all well-behaved pedestrians. The fatigued tradesman,\r\n    the weary labourer, may at any time saunter round and walk to the\r\n    brink of the giddy heights facing Levi; feast their eyes on the\r\n    striking panorama unrolled at their feet; watch the white winged\r\n    argosies of commerce float swan-like on the bosom of the mighty flood,\r\n    whilst the wealthy citizen, in his panelled carriage, would take his\r\n    afternoon drive round the Park _en payant_. The student, the\r\n    scholar, the traveller might each in turn find here amusement, and\r\n    fresh air and shade, and with sketch book and map in hand, come and\r\n    study or copy the formation of the battle-field and its monument;\r\n    whilst the city _belle_ on her palfrey, or the youthful equestrian,\r\n    fresh from college, might enjoy a canter round the undulating course\r\n    in September on all days, except that Autumn week sacred to the turf,\r\n    ever since 1789, selected by the sporting fraternity.\r\n\r\n    In November, 1876, an association was formed, composed as follows: His\r\n    Honour the Lieut.-Governor, His Worship the Mayor, Chief Justice\r\n    Meredith, Hon. Judge Tessier, Hon. E. Chinic, Hon. D. E. Price, Chs.\r\n    E. Levey, Hon. P. Garneau, Col. Rhodes, John Gilmour, John Burstall,\r\n    Hon. C. C. DeLéry, J. Bte. Renaud, Jos. Hamel, J. M. LeMoine, Hon.\r\n    Thos. McGreevy, Hon. C. Alleyn, C. F. Smith, A. P. Caron, Thos.\r\n    Beckett, James Gibb, R. R. Dobell, with E. J. Meredith, Secretary.\r\n    Hon. E. Chinic, and Messrs. C. F. Smith, and R. R. Dobell were named\r\n    Trustees to accept for the nominal sum of $1, the lease held by the\r\n    City Corporation, the Corporation continuing liable for the annual\r\n    rent of $200. Though the late period of the season prevented the\r\n    association from doing anything, beyond having the future Park\r\n    suitably fenced in, the praiseworthy object in contemplation has not\r\n    been lost sight of, and active measures in furtherance of the same\r\n    will yet be taken.\r\n\r\n    It would be unjust to close this hasty sketch without awarding a word\r\n    of praise and encouragement to one of the most active promoters of the\r\n    scheme, R. R. Dobell, Esq., of Beauvoir, Sillery. (These lines penned\r\n    in 1876, we recall this day, with regret, the excellent idea of\r\n    Battlefield Park having fallen through, on the promoters discovery\r\n    that the 99 years lease, granted by the Ursuline Nuns would expire in\r\n    a very few years, when the Nuns would resume the site).\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE DUKE OF KENT'S LODGE,--MONTMORENCI._\r\n\r\n  \"Oh! give me a home where the cataract's foam\r\n  Is admired by the poor and the rich, as they roam\r\n  By thy banks, Montmorenci, so placid and fair,\r\n  Oh! what would I give, could I find a home there.\"\r\n\r\nThe Montmorenci heights and beaches have become famous on account of the\r\nsuccessful defence made there during the whole summer of 1759, by\r\nMontcalm, against the attacks of Wolfe's veterans. Finally, the French\r\nlines having been deemed impregnable on the Beauport side, a fort and\r\nbarracks [211] were repeatedly talked of at Isle aux Coudres, to winter\r\nthe troops. Wolfe was, however, overruled in his councils, and a spot near\r\nSillery pointed out for a descent, possibly by a French renegade, Denis de\r\nVitré, [212] probably by Major Stobo, who, being allowed a good deal of\r\nfreedom during his captivity, knew the locality well. Stobo had been all\r\nwinter a prisoner of war in the city, having been sent down from Fort\r\nNecessity, on its surrender, to Quebec, in 1754, by the French, from whom\r\nhe escaped in the beginning of May, 1759, and joined Durell and Saunders'\r\nfleet long before it reached Point Levi. These same heights, celebrated\r\nfor their scenery, were destined, later on, to acquire additional interest\r\nfrom the sojourn thereat of a personage of no mean rank--the future father\r\nof our august Sovereign.\r\n\r\nFacing the roaring cataract of Montmorenci stands the \"Mansion House,\"\r\nbuilt by Sir Frederic Haldimand, C.B., [213] when Governor of the\r\nProvince--here Sir Frederic entertained, in 1782, the Baronness Redesdale,\r\nthe wife of the Brunswick General, who had come over with Burgoyne to\r\nfight the continentals in 1775,--a plain-looking lodge, still existing, to\r\nwhich, some years back, wings have been added, making it considerably\r\nlarger. This was the favourite summer abode of an English Prince. His\r\nRoyal Highness Edward Augustus, Colonel of the Royal Fusileers,\r\nsubsequently Field Marshal the Duke of Kent, \"had landed here,\" says the\r\n_Quebec Gazette_ of the 18th August, 1791, from H. M. ships _Ulysses_ and\r\n_Resistance_, [214] in seven weeks from Gibraltar, with the 7th or Royal\r\nRegiment of Fusileers.\" The Prince had evidently a strong fancy for\r\ncountry life, as may be inferred by the fact that, during his prolonged\r\nstay in Halifax, as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, he owned also, seven\r\nmiles out of the city, a similar rustic lodge, of which Haliburton has\r\ngiven a charming description. 'Twas on the 11th of August the youthful\r\ncolonel, with his fine regiment, landed in the Lower Town; on the 12th was\r\nheld in his honour, at the Château St. Louis, a levée, whereat attended\r\nthe authorities, civil, military and clerical, together with the gentry.\r\nIn the afternoon \"the ladies were presented to the Prince in the Château.\"\r\nWho, then, attended this levée? Did he dance? If so, who were his\r\npartners? No register of names; no list of Edward's partners, such as we\r\nhave of the Prince of Wales. [215] No _Court Journal_! Merely an entry of\r\nthe names of the signers of the address in the _Quebec Gazette_ of the\r\n18th August, 1791. Can we not, then, re-people the little world of Quebec\r\nof 1791?--bring back some of the principal actors of those stormy\r\npolitical, but frolicsome times? Let us walk in with the \"nobility and\r\ngentry,\" and make our best bow to the scion of royalty. There, in fall\r\nuniform, you will recognize His Excellency Lord Dorchester, the Governor-\r\nGeneral, one of our most popular administrators; next to him, that tall,\r\nathletic military man, is the Deputy Governor-General, Sir Alured Clark.\r\nHe looks eager to grasp the reins of office from his superior, who will\r\nset sail for _home_ in a few days. See how thoughtful the Deputy Governor\r\nappears; in order to stand higher with his royal English master he\r\nchuckles before-hand over the policy which gives to many old French\r\nterritorial divisions, right English names--Durham, Suffolk, Prince\r\nEdward, York, Granville, Buckinghamshire, Herefordshire, Kent. The western\r\nsection of Canada will rejoice in the new names of Hesse, Luneberg,\r\nNassau, Mecklenburg. That Deputy Governor will yet live to win a _baton_\r\n[216] of Field Marshal under a Hanoverian sovereign. He is now in close\r\nconversation with Chief Justice William Smith, senior. Round there are a\r\nbevy of Judges, Legislative Councillors, Members of Parliament, all done\r\nup to kill, _à l'ancienne mode_, by Monsigneur Jean Laforme, [217] court\r\nhair-dresser, with powdered periwigs, ruffles and formidable pigtails.\r\nHere is Judge Mabane, Secretary Pownall, Honorable Messrs. Finlay, [218]\r\nDunn, Harrison, Holland, Collins, Caldwell, Fraser, Lymburner; Messrs.\r\nLester, Young, Smith junior. Mingled with them you also recognize the\r\nbearers of old historic names--Messrs. de Longueuil, Baby, de Bonne,\r\nDuchesnay, Dunière, Guéroult, de Lotbinière, Roc de St. Ours, Dambourgès,\r\nde Rocheblave, de Rouville, de Boucherville, Le Compte, Dupré, Bellestre,\r\nTaschereau, de Tonnancour, Panet, de Salaberry, and a host of others. Were\r\nthese gentlemen all present? Probably not, they were likely to be. Dear\r\nreader, you want to know also what royal Edward did--said--was thought of\r\n--amongst the Belgravians of old Stadacona, during the three summers he\r\nspent in Quebec.\r\n\r\n  \"How he looked when he danced, when he sat at his ease,\r\n  When his Highness had sneezed, or was going to sneeze.\"\r\n\r\nBear in mind then, that we have to deal with a dashing Colonel of\r\nFusileers--age twenty-five--status, a prince of the blood; add that he was\r\nardent, generous, impulsive, gallant; a tall, athletic fellow; in fact,\r\none of George III.'s big, burly boys--dignified in manner--a bit of a\r\nstatesman; witness his happy and successful speech [219] at the hustings\r\nof the Charlesbourg election, and the biting rebuke it contained in\r\nanticipation--for Sir Edmund Head's unlucky post-prandial joke about the\r\n_superior_ race. Would you prefer to know him after he had left our\r\nshores and become Field Marshal the Duke of Kent? Take up his biography by\r\nthe Rev. Erskine Neale, and read therein that royal Edward was a truthful,\r\nChristian gentleman--a chivalrous soldier, though a stern disciplinarian--\r\nan excellent husband--a persecuted and injured brother--a neglected son--\r\nthe munificent patron of literary, educational and charitable\r\ninstitutions--a patriotic Prince--in short, a model of a man and a paragon\r\nof every virtue. But was he all that? we hear you say. No doubt of it.\r\nHave you not a clergyman's word for it--his biographer's? The Rev. Erskine\r\nNeale will tell you what His Royal Highness did at Kensington Palace, or\r\nCastlebar Hill. Such his task; ours, merely to show you the gallant young\r\ncolonel, emerging bright and early from his Montmorenci Lodge, thundering\r\nwith his spirited pair of Norman horses over the Beauport and Canardière\r\nroad; one day, \"sitting down to whist and partridges for supper,\" at the\r\nhospitable board of a fine old scholar and gentleman, M. de Salaberry,\r\nthen M.P.P. for the county of Quebec, the father of the hero of\r\nChâteauguay, and who resided near the Beauport church. The old de\r\nSalaberry mansion has since been united by purchase to Savnoc, Col. B. C.\r\nA. Gugy's estate. Another day you may see him dash past Belmont or Holland\r\nHouse or Powell Place, occasionally dropping in with the _bonhommie_\r\nof a good, kind Prince, as he was--especially when the ladies were young\r\nand pretty. You surely did not expect to find an anchorite in a slashing\r\nColonel of Fusileers--in perfect health, age, twenty-five. Not a grain of\r\nasceticism ever entered, you know, in the composition of \"Farmer George's\"\r\nbig sons; York and Clarence, they were no saints; neither were they\r\nsuspected of asceticism; not they, they knew better. And should royal\r\nEdward, within your sight, ever kiss his hand to any fair daughter of Eve,\r\ninside or outside of the city, do not, my Christian friend, upturn to\r\nheaven the whites of your eyes in pious horror; princes are men, nay, they\r\nrequire at times to be more than men to escape the snares, smiles,\r\nseductions, which beset them at every step in this wicked, wicked, world.\r\nHow was Montmorenci Lodge furnished? Is it true that the Prince's\r\nremittances, from Carlton House never exceeded £5,000 per annum during his\r\nstay here?--Had he really as many bells to summon his attendants in his\r\nBeauport Lodge as his Halifax residence contained--as he had at Kensington\r\nor Castlebar Hill? Is it a fact that he was such a punctual and early\r\nriser, that to ensure punctuality on this point, on of his servants was\r\ncommanded to sleep during the day in order to be sure to be awake at day-\r\nbreak to ring the bell?--Did he really threaten to court-martial the 7th\r\nFusileers, majors, captains, subs and privates, who might refuse to sport\r\ntheir pig-tails in the streets of Quebec, as well as at Gibraltar?\r\n\r\nReally, dear reader, your inquisitiveness has got beyond all bounds; and\r\nwere Prince Edward to revisit those shores, we venture to say, that you\r\nwould in a frenzy of curiosity or loyalty even do what was charged by De\r\nCordova, when Edward's grandson, Albert of Wales, visited, in 1860, Canada\r\nand the American Union:--\r\n\r\n  \"They have stolen his gloves and purloined his cravat\r\n  Even scraped a souvenir from the nap of his hat.\"\r\n\r\nBe thankful if we satisfy even one or two of your queries. He had indeed\r\nto live here on the niggardly allowance of £5,000 per annum. The story\r\n[220] about censuring an officer for cutting off his pig-tail refers not\r\nto his stay in Canada, but to another period of his life. He lived rather\r\nretired; a select few only were admitted to his intimacy; his habits were\r\nhere, as elsewhere, regular; his punctuality, proverbial; his stay amongst\r\nus, marked by several acts of kindness, of which we find traces in the\r\naddresses presented on several occasions, thanking him for his own\r\npersonal exertions and the assistance rendered by his gallant men at\r\nseveral fires which had occurred. [221] He left behind some warm admirers,\r\nwith whom he corresponded regularly. We have now before us a package of\r\nhis letters dated \"Kensington Palace.\" Here is one out of twenty; but no,\r\nthe records of private friendship must remain inviolate.\r\n\r\nThe main portion of the \"Mansion House,\" at Montmorenci, is just as he\r\nleft it. The room in which he used to write is yet shown; a table and\r\nchair--part of his furniture--are to this day religiously preserved. The\r\nlodge is now the residence of the heirs of the late G. B Hall, Esquire,\r\nthe proprietors of the extensive saw mills at the foot of the falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THE DUKE OF KENT, THE QUEEN'S FATHER, AT QUEBEC, 1791-4._\r\n\r\n    Of the numerous sons of King George III., none, perhaps, were born\r\n    with more generous impulses, none certainly more manly--none more true\r\n    in their attachments, and still none more maligned neglected--traduced\r\n    than he, who, as a jolly Colonel of Fusileers spent some pleasant\r\n    years of his life at Quebec from 1791 to '94, Edward Augustus, father\r\n    of our virtuous and beloved Sovereign.\r\n\r\n    We wish to be understood at the outset. It is not our intention here\r\n    to write a panegyric on a royal Duke; like his brothers, York and\r\n    Clarence--the pleasure-loving, he, too, had his foibles; he was not an\r\n    anchorite by any means. His stern, Spartan idea of discipline may have\r\n    been overstretched, and blind adherence to routine in his daily habits\r\n    may have justly invited the lash of ridicule. What is pretended here,\r\n    and that, without fear of contradiction, is that his faults, which\r\n    were those of a man, were loudly proclaimed, while his spirit of\r\n    justice, of benevolence and generosity was unknown, unrecognized,\r\n    except by a few. No stronger record can be opposed to the traducers of\r\n    the memory of Edward, Duke of Kent, than his voluminous correspondence\r\n    with Col. DeSalaberry and brothers, from 1791 to 1815--recently,\r\n    through the kindness of the DeSalaberry family, laid before the public\r\n    by the late Dr. W. J. Anderson, of Quebec.\r\n\r\n    The Duke had not been lucky in the way of biographers. The Rev.\r\n    Erskine Neale, who wrote his life, is less a biographer than a\r\n    panegyrist, and his book, if, instead of much fulsome praise, it\r\n    contained a fuller account--especially of the early career of his\r\n    hero--of the Duke's sayings and doings in Gibraltar, Quebec and\r\n    Halifax, it would certainly prove more valuable, much more complete.\r\n\r\n    Singularly enough, Neale, disposes in about three lines, of the years\r\n    the Duke spent in Quebec, though, as proved by his correspondence,\r\n    those years were anything but barren. Quebec, we contend, as exhibited\r\n    in the Duke's letters, ever retained a green spot in his souvenirs, in\r\n    after life.\r\n\r\n    The Old Château balls, the Kent House in St. Lewis street, had for him\r\n    their joyful sunshine, when, as a stalwart, dashing Colonel of\r\n    Fusileers, aged 25, he had his _entrées_ in the fashionable drawing-\r\n    rooms of 1791-4 Holland House, Powell Place (Spencer Wood, as it is\r\n    now called), old Hale's receptions, Lymburner's soirees in his old\r\n    mansion on Sault au Matelot street, then the fashionable quarter for\r\n    wealthy merchants. The Duke's cottage _orné_ at the Montmorenci Falls\r\n    had also its joyous memories, but these were possibly too tender to be\r\n    expatiated on in detail.\r\n\r\n    The Prince, it appears, was also present on an occasion of no ordinary\r\n    moment to the colony that is when the King, his father, \"granted a\r\n    Lower Chamber to the two provinces in 1791.\"\r\n\r\n    The only original source now available for inditing that portion of\r\n    the Duke's life spent in Quebec, is Neilson's old _Quebec Gazette_,\r\n    supplemented with divers old traditions, not always reliable.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Anderson's compilation will certainly go far to dispel the\r\n    atmosphere of misrepresentation floating around the character of\r\n    Prince Edward, as he was familiarly styled when here during the past\r\n    century. The character of the most humble individual, when casually\r\n    mentioned in history, ought to be free from misrepresentation. Why\r\n    this rule should not apply to the manly soldier who, in the streets of\r\n    old Quebec in 1791, headed his gallant men wherever a riot, a fire, or\r\n    a public calamity required their presence, is difficult to understand.\r\n    No man was more popular in the city from the services he rendered when\r\n    called on. One class, however, found in him an unrelenting\r\n    disciplinarian--the refractory soldier attempting mutiny or desertion\r\n    from the corps.\r\n\r\n    We are invited to these reflections from the fact that new light is\r\n    now promised to us on this traduced commander, in the shape of what\r\n    will no doubt be an attractive biography of Duke Edward from the pen\r\n    of a London _littérateur_ of note, whose name we are not justified in\r\n    giving at present. The following extract from a London letter,\r\n    received this last mail by a gentleman of this city, who has succeeded\r\n    in gathering together valuable materials for Canadian history, will\r\n    prove what we now assert. It is addressed to Mr. LeMoine, late\r\n    President of the Literary and Historical Society, whose sketch of the\r\n    Prince's career in 1791, as contained in the _Maple Leaves_ for 1865,\r\n    seems to have obtained the full approbation of the distinguished\r\n    _littérateur_ now engaged in writing the life of the Duke:\r\n\r\n    \"SOUTH KENSINGTON, London, May 30, 1874.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR,--If my note on Miss Nevill's incident [222] clears up any\r\n    point hitherto obscure of Canadian life, use it by all means for your\r\n    Canadian sketches. During my searches consequent to elucidate the\r\n    Duke's sojourn in Canada, many curious stories came under my eye,\r\n    which have never, as I am aware, been yet published in Canadian\r\n    histories, when the Prince was stationed at Quebec. The London pens\r\n    were m the habit of publishing from time to time incidents of\r\n    considerable interest bearing on forgotten periods of the early\r\n    British Constitutional History of Canada--parliamentary. My intention\r\n    is to note them in the life of H.R.H., as he was present when the\r\n    King granted a lower Chamber to the two provinces in 1791. From this\r\n    circumstance he based his firm adherence to a constitutional\r\n    Government as the safest mode to ensure freedom to all parties\r\n    interested therein. My work on the Duke of Kent would have been\r\n    published ere this, but I am awaiting the correspondence promised me\r\n    by Lord B---- addressed to Lord L----, and that also to Sir H----\r\n    Douglas, formerly Lieutenant-Governor of ----. Your suggestion will\r\n    not be lost sight of. _Maple Leaves_ have been fully culled for\r\n    information concerning the Prince. Holland Farm and the Duke at\r\n    Montmorenci give a correct picture of life in Quebec in 1791--\r\n    information unknown to Rev. Mr. Neale in 1850.\r\n\r\n    If not too much trouble, could you let me know whether these works, of\r\n    which I enclose a list, mention the Duke in Canada, for the British\r\n    Museum does not possess these publications, which obliges me to seek\r\n    information from such a person as yourself, who is versed in Canadian\r\n    affairs. I am anxious to give a correct account of the Duke in Canada.\r\n    This period of his life has escaped all the biographers of the Prince,\r\n    Philippart and Neale, &c. If I should meet any striking incident\r\n    relative to Canadian affairs, I shall forward it to your address.\"--\r\n    _From Quebec Morning Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_L'ASYLE CHAMPÊTRE._\r\n\r\nFounded by Joseph Francois Perrault, the pioneer of lay education in the\r\nProvince of Quebec.\r\n\r\n\"In these days of ambitious, showy villas and grand mansions, whose lofty\r\nand imposing proportions, elaborate architectural ornaments, conspicuous\r\nverandahs and prominent sites are all designed, not only to gratify the\r\ntaste and pride of their owners, but to impress with wonder and admiration\r\nthe ordinary observer, it may be interesting to give a description of Mr.\r\nPerrault's residence, a fair specimen of a comfortable and well ordered\r\ndwelling of the olden time. My object, in describing it, is to convey to\r\nthe present generation some idea of the taste and domestic architecture of\r\nour ancestors, especially to those who, in culture and social influence,\r\nmight truly be regarded as representative men. For a similar purpose, I\r\nhave thought of presenting such social pictures of the good old times, of\r\nhis habits and practices, as marked his connection with his relatives and\r\nneighbors, and in this way an instructive lesson may be learned.\r\n\r\nMr. Perrault's abode was a building of one storey, with attics in front\r\nand two in rear, in the style of the eighteenth century, on the north side\r\nof the St. Louis Road, on the spot known to historians as les buttes à\r\nnepveu, to-day, as Perrault's Hill, upon which the residence of Mr. Henry\r\nDinning now stands. As all students are aware, this is classic ground;\r\nhere was fought the main struggles of the battles of the Plains of Abraham\r\nand of St. Foy; Murray's troops having entrenched themselves here on the\r\neve of the engagement with de Levis. A stone wall with an elegant railing\r\ndivided the property from the main road, near which was a graceful little\r\nnestled summer house, overgrown with creepers and vines; through an avenue\r\nwith flowery borders, between lines of lofty vases, filled with blooming\r\nplants, the visitor reached the house, which occupied the centre of a\r\ngarden of four acres. Above the door, at the summit of a flight of steps,\r\nwas inscribed in gilt letters, _Asyle Champêtre_. It was a double\r\nhouse with a conservatory at each end, the first erected in Canada, filled\r\nwith exotic and native plants, at some distance on either side were\r\nminiature Norman turrets. Mr. Perrault had selected this favourable site\r\nfor his residence, carefully noting all its advantages. The rays of the\r\nrising sun flashed through the front windows, cheering him in his morning\r\nlabours, while as the day wore on, a flood of mellow light suffused the\r\nwestern portion of his chamber. From such vantage ground, Mr. Perrault, of\r\nan evening, could observe the movements of the heavenly bodies, the\r\nposition of the planets and the various phenomena of the firmament; the\r\nstudy of which had great attractions for him, and created in his mind a\r\ngratitude to the great architect for all His vast works and beneficent\r\ncare. On entering the visitor found himself in the reception room, of\r\nabout twenty-four feet square, with a large bay window towards the north,\r\nand used as a drawing room and study. In whatever direction one looked,\r\nthe view was attractive; to the south, the commanding heights of Point\r\nLevi, with the chasm between, where rolled by the great St. Lawrence; to\r\nthe east, the picturesque island of Orleans, dividing the river into two\r\nchannels, and the imposing old Citadel, or martial crown of the city on\r\nCape Diamond; to the north, the meandering river in the beautiful valley\r\nof St. Charles, the heights of Charlesbourg and Lorette, the shore of\r\nBeauport, the faint trace of the _embouchure_ of the Montmorenci, and\r\nthe grand Laurentian mountain range in the distance; and to the west, the\r\nbattle fields of 1759 and 60, memorable for their heroic deeds and\r\nmomentous results--views most charming, exquisite and impressive.\r\n\r\nThe front grounds were utilized as a model garden and orchard, in which\r\nevery improvement in horticulture had been adopted and were laid out in\r\nplots and gravelled walks. In rear of the house was a miniature pond,\r\nenlivened by waterfowl and turtles, and whose banks were adorned with\r\nwater plants and ferns, and receding thence were plateaux, covered with\r\nflowers of every description.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the picturesque appearance and commanding position of Mr.\r\nPerrault's house, the internal arrangements of the apartments deserve\r\nnotice, particularly as in them often met the leading men of Quebec, where\r\nthey discussed the fluctuations of the public mind, benevolent enterprises\r\nand matters of general interest. The parlor in the _Asyle Champêtre_\r\nwas well known to the élite and leaders of society of that day; elegantly,\r\nbut not luxuriously, furnished; the carpet was made of flax, sown and\r\ngrown on the grounds adjoining his schools, and woven by the pupils; the\r\nwalls were hung with valuable paintings and ornamented by objects of\r\n_virtû_ artistically arranged. From the centre descended a lustre of\r\nsix candles; at the rear angles were large circular mirrors, one concave\r\nand the other convex, with lights on each side, reflecting every object in\r\nmovement in the apartment. Two bronze statues, or candelabra, with lights,\r\nguarded either side of the hall door, in keeping with the surroundings;\r\nthe hangings and furniture were in the style of Louis XIV., in which the\r\ncolours harmoniously blended. On the left hand of this apartment was Mr.\r\nPerrault's library, in which was a choice collection of Greek, Latin,\r\nEnglish, French and Spanish works, on philosophy, history and _les\r\nbelles lettres_. No one had a higher respect for the classics than he;\r\nthe odes of Horace, the poems of Virgil and the orations of Cicero were as\r\nfamiliar to him as the best sermons of Bossuet or the tragedies of Racine.\r\nOn the right was another room, with a piano and organ, to which the family\r\ndevoted much attention, and lovers of music were certain of hearing there\r\nexcellent performances and well-cultivated voices.\r\n\r\nThose who bad the privilege of enjoying his hospitality on ordinary\r\noccasions, could never forget the hearty welcome of their whole-souled\r\nentertainer; and on two particular days, the first of January and the\r\n_fête de St. Joseph_, his patron saint, they had still better reason\r\nfor its remembrance. These social gatherings were for months looked\r\nforward to as the events of the season, and for many a day subsequently\r\nthey recalled most agreeable recollections. As was then the custom, the\r\nguests arrived early in the afternoon and took their departure at the\r\nunfashionable hour of nine, and in the interval engaged themselves in\r\ndancing, in games, in listening to brilliant executions on different\r\nmusical instruments and the rich melody of well-trained voices, in ballad\r\nand song, clever repartees and intellectual conversation, while the supper\r\ntable, laden with all the delicacies procurable, was a continual feast\r\nfrom the opening to the close of the entertainment. The guests were\r\nescorted down the avenue by their host and his family, and as he bade them\r\ngood night, the shouts and merry laughter of the younger ones rang\r\njoyfully in the night air, startling the passers by with their frolicsome\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nMr. Perrault's table had a wide reputation, and although he never issued\r\ngeneral invitations, it was rarely without two, or more, guests, for those\r\nwho happened to be at the _Asyle_ at meal time were cordially invited\r\nto join in the family repast. From taste and habit, his board ever\r\npresented a tempting display; but, as regards himself, he was most\r\nabstemious, partaking sparingly and of but few dishes, while to his guests\r\nhis hospitality was unbounded.  His old cook sometimes found her task\r\nhard, or pretended to; and on one occasion, returning from confession, she\r\nremarked that she had said to M. le Curé, when he counselled patience and\r\nsubmission, \"_je voudrais bien vous y voir_,\" (I would like to see you in\r\nmy place). Even in those days cooks were testy, for, when Mr. Perrault\r\nfound fault with her, she would answer as impertinently as one could in\r\nthese days: \"_voulez-vous que je vous dise la vérité?  Vous commencez à\r\nêtre dégoûté de ma cuisine_,\" (Do you want me to tell you the truth? You\r\nare getting tired of my cooking). To the tried and impatient, the above\r\nincidents will cause them to ask themselves if there be any truth in the\r\nold saying: \"God sent us food and the devil sent us cooks.\"\r\n\r\nA custom illustrative of the habits of that period, was the visit of\r\nrelations on New Year's morning. Old and young presented themselves at\r\nfive o'clock and repaired in a file to Mr. Perrault's bedroom to receive\r\nhis blessing. He afterwards rose, dressed and made all happy by giving\r\nthem suitable presents and paying graceful compliments. Later in the day\r\nwas witnessed a still more interesting scene, when his pupils, of both\r\nsexes, and doubtless to their fullest number, arrived at his hospitable\r\nmansion to offer him their grateful acknowledgements of his kindness. A\r\ntable, close by where he sat, in a large arm chair, was covered with piles\r\nof \"horns of plenty,\" filled with sweetmeats, and to each he presented\r\none, with a small piece of silver; and these children, who needed more\r\nsubstantial gifts, had but to make their wants known and they were rarely\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nOn that day he also made calls immediately after Grand Mass, in the\r\nextremity of his politeness carrying his hat under his arm, regardless of\r\nthe weather, with the _queue_ of his wig blown to and fro by the\r\nwind. His arrival, as a matter of coarse, caused a social stir, often\r\nrecalled with pleasure by many afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _MARCHMONT._\r\n\r\n      \"Oh! give me a home on that bold classic height,\r\n      Where in sweet contemplation in age's dark night,\r\n      I may tread o'er the plain where as histories tell\r\n      Britain's stout-hearted Wolfe in his victory fell.\"\r\n\r\n    Adjoining the expanse of table land, now known as the Plains of\r\n    Abraham, and divided from it to the east by a high fence, lies with a\r\n    southern exposure a level and well-cultivated farm--Marchmont--\r\n    tastefully laid out some sixty summers ago by Sir John Harvey, next\r\n    occupied for several years by Sir Thomas Noel Hill, subsequently owned\r\n    by Hon. John Stewart, and for more than twenty years the residence of\r\n    John Gilmour, Esquire, of the well-known Glasgow house of Pollock,\r\n    Gilmour & Co. [223] To the west, Marchmont farm is bounded by\r\n    Wolfesfield; to the south by the river heights, having a valuable\r\n    timber cove (Wolfe's cove) attached to it. The dwelling, a cheerful\r\n    and sunny residence, decks a sloping lawn, not far from the high bank,\r\n    embedded as it were in a clump of fir, ash, maple and pine trees,\r\n    which conceal it from St. Lewis road, and afford, on the opposite\r\n    side, a variety of charming glimpses of our noble estuary, the main\r\n    artery of western commerce. A spacious and richly-stocked conservatory\r\n    opens on the drawing-room to the west of the house. The embellishment\r\n    was erected by the late John Gilmour, who also added a vinery.\r\n\r\n    In the summer months, visitors travelling past Marchmont cannot fail\r\n    to notice the magnificent hawthorn hedge, interspersed here and there\r\n    with young maple, which encloses it on the St. Lewis road.\r\n\r\n    Marchmont, even shorn of its historical memories, would much interest\r\n    an observer who had an eye to agricultural pursuits carried to a high\r\n    state of perfection. The outlines and arrangements for raising cattle,\r\n    poultry, &c., are on a truly comprehensive scale.\r\n\r\n    Connected with Marchmont, there are incidents of the past, which will\r\n    ever impress it on the mind of the visitor. A century back, over this\r\n    same locality, the tide of battle surged for several hours when\r\n    Wolfe's army had ascended the cliff. No later than 1860, the crumbling\r\n    bones of fallen warriors were discovered whilst laying the foundation\r\n    of the flag-staff to the east of the house. They were buried again\r\n    carefully under the same flagstaff--erected to salute the Prince of\r\n    Wales when passing Marchmont. Let us hear one of the actors on that\r\n    eventful September morning of 1759--Capt. John King:--\r\n\r\n    \"Before day break,\" says he, \"this morning we made a descent upon the\r\n    north shore, about half a mile to the eastward of Sillery; and the\r\n    light troops were fortunately, by the rapidity of the current, carried\r\n    lower down, between us and Cape Diamond. We had in this detachment\r\n    thirty flat-bottomed boats, containing about 1600 men. This was a\r\n    great surprise on the enemy, who, from the natural strength of the\r\n    place, did not suspect, and consequently were not prepared against, so\r\n    bold an attempt. The chain of sentries which they had posted along the\r\n    summit of the heights, galled us a little and picked off several men\r\n    (in the boat where I was one man was killed; one seaman, with four\r\n    soldiers, were slightly, and two mortally wounded, and some officers),\r\n    before our light infantry got up to dislodge them. This grand\r\n    enterprise was conducted and executed with great good order and\r\n    discretion; as fast as we landed the boats were put off for\r\n    reinforcements, and the troops formed with much regularity; the\r\n    General, with Brigadiers Monckton and Murray, were ashore with the\r\n    first division. We lost no time, but clambered up one of the steepest\r\n    precipices that can be conceived, being almost a perpendicular and of\r\n    an incredible length; as soon as we gained the summit all was quiet,\r\n    and not a shot was heard, owing to the excellent conduct of the\r\n    infantry under Colonel Howe. It was by this time clear day-light. Here\r\n    we formed again, the river and the south country in our rear, our\r\n    right extending to the town, our left to Sillery, and halted a few\r\n    moments. The general then detached the light troops to our left to\r\n    rout the enemy from their battery, and to disable their guns, except\r\n    they should be rendered serviceable to the party who were to remain\r\n    there; and this service was soon performed. We then faced to the right\r\n    and marched towards the town by files, till we came to the Plains of\r\n    Abraham, an even piece of ground which Wolfe had made choice of, while\r\n    we stood forming upon the hill. Weather showery; about six o'clock the\r\n    enemy first made their appearance upon the heights, between us and the\r\n    town; whereupon we halted and wheeled to the right, forming the line\r\n    of battle.\"\r\n\r\n    For some time past Marchmont has been occupied by Col. Ferdinand\r\n    Turnbull, of the Q. O. Canadian Hussars.\r\n\r\n        _ANECDOTE OF WOLFE'S ARMY._\r\n\r\n        \"After the conquest of Quebec, the troops had to make shift for\r\n        quarters wherever they could find a habitable place; I myself made\r\n        choice of a small house in the lane leading to the Esplanade,\r\n        where Ginger the Gardner now lives (1828), and which had belonged\r\n        to Paquet the schoolmaster--although it was scarcely habitable\r\n        from the number of our shells that had fallen through it. However,\r\n        as I had a small party of the company, I continued to get a number\r\n        of little jobs done towards making it passably comfortable for the\r\n        men, and for my own part I got Hector Munro, who was a joiner by\r\n        trade, to knock up a kind of \"cabinet\" (as the Canadians called\r\n        it) in one corner of the house for myself. We had a stove, but our\r\n        Highlanders, who know no better, would not suffer the door to be\r\n        closed, as they thought if they could not naturally _see_ the\r\n        fire, it was impossible that they could _feel_ it. In this\r\n        way they passed the whole of the winter; three or four would sit\r\n        close up to the door of the stove, and when these were a little\r\n        warmed, three or four others would relieve them, and so on. Some\r\n        days they were almost frozen to death, or suffocated by the smoke,\r\n        and to mend the matter they had nothing better than green wood!\r\n\r\n        I contrived somehow or other to procure six blankets, so that\r\n        notwithstanding that I was almost frozen during the day, being the\r\n        whole winter out on duty, superintending the party of our\r\n        Highlanders, making fascines in the woods, still I passed the\r\n        nights pretty comfortably. 'Twas funny enough to see, every\r\n        morning, the whole surface of the blankets covered with ice, from\r\n        the heat of my breath and body. We wore our kilts the whole of\r\n        this time, but there was no accident, as we were sheltered by the\r\n        woods. I bought myself a pair of leather breeches, but I could not\r\n        walk in them, so I laid them aside.\r\n\r\n        When the spring came round, the French again made their appearance\r\n        on high ground between the town and Abraham's Plains, and General\r\n        Murray must needs march us out to fight them. At this time\r\n        scarcely a man in the garrison but was afflicted with colds or\r\n        coughs. The day fixed on orders was the 28th April, 1760, at seven\r\n        in the morning, and cold and raw enough it was! Before the sortie\r\n        I took a biscuit and, spread a bit of butter over it, and I set\r\n        about 'cranching' it, and said to Hector Munro, for whom I had a\r\n        great attachment: \"You had better do as I am doing, for you cannot\r\n        know when you may be able to get your next meal.\" Hector answered,\r\n        \"I will not touch anything; I have already taken my last meal, for\r\n        something tells me that I shall never require another meal in this\r\n        world.\" \"Hout! man,\" said I, \"you are talking nonsense; take a\r\n        biscuit, I tell you.\" But no, Hector would have none! Well, the\r\n        hour came for parading, and we were soon afterwards marched out of\r\n        the garrison. It was my lot to act as covering sergeant to\r\n        Lieutenant Fraser of our Grenadiers, who had already been wounded\r\n        at the affair of the Falls, through the belly and out at his back,\r\n        without his scarcely having felt it. (This Lieutenant Fraser was\r\n        nephew to my friend Captain Baillie, who was the first man killed\r\n        at the landing at Louisbourg, and who, had he lived, would have\r\n        been the means of securing to me my commission, as had been the\r\n        understanding between him and Colonel Fraser, when I volunteered\r\n        in Scotland for service in America). Early in the action with the\r\n        French, Lieut. Fraser received a shot in the temple, which felled\r\n        him to the very spot on which he then stood, and as not an inch of\r\n        ground was to be lost, I had to move up into line, which I could\r\n        not have done without my resting one foot upon his body! The\r\n        affair went altogether against us, and we had to retreat back into\r\n        the town. When I got back to my quarters, I there found poor\r\n        Hector Munro, who not being able to walk, had been carried in,\r\n        owning to a wound he had received in the lower part of the belly,\r\n        through which his bowels were coming out! He had his senses about\r\n        him, and reminded me of our conversation just before the battle.\r\n        He was taken to the Hôtel Dieu, where he died the next morning, in\r\n        great agony. When I first saw the French soldiers I thought them a\r\n        dirty, ragged set--their clothing was originally white. Many of\r\n        them, particularly in the 'Regiment de la Reine,' had a bit of\r\n        blue ribbon to the buttonhole of their coat, with a little white\r\n        shell fixed to it, which they called 'Papa,' and this, it seems,\r\n        was a mark of honour for having distinguished themselves on some\r\n        former occasion. I, at first, mistook them for Freemasons! After\r\n        the battle of the Plains of Abraham, on the 13th September, fifty-\r\n        nine, when a great many of the French lay killed and wounded on\r\n        the field (we killed seventy-two officers alone) it was horrid to\r\n        see the effect of blood and dust on their white coats! They lay\r\n        there as thick as a flock of sheep, and just as they had fallen,\r\n        for the main body had been completely routed off the ground, and\r\n        had not an opportunity of carrying away their dead and wounded\r\n        men. I recollect to have lost a regimental coat by their means.\r\n        There was no place about the town to put the wounded in, and they\r\n        had to be carried down the bank to Wolfe's cove, and from thence\r\n        put into boats and taken across to the lower ferry-place at Point\r\n        Levis, for the purpose of their being placed under the care of our\r\n        surgeons at the church (St Joseph's), which was converted into a\r\n        temporary hospital. Our men had nothing better to carry them on\r\n        than a handbarrow with canvass laid across it. By this means it\r\n        required two of our men to carry one of them to the top of the\r\n        hill at Point Levis.\r\n\r\n        The business going on very slowly, I at last got out of patience\r\n        looking at them, so I set to work and took up a wounded man to my\r\n        own share, and did not let him down at the top of the hill but\r\n        landed him safe at the temporary hospital. By the time that we had\r\n        done with them I was fatigued enough, and 'afaith, I spoiled my\r\n        red coat into the bargain!\r\n\r\n        The poor fellows would cry out lustily when they were in an uneasy\r\n        position, but we could not understand a word of what they said.\r\n        One of them had one of his cheeks lying flat down upon his\r\n        shoulder, which he got by attempting to run away, though he had a\r\n        Highlander at his heels. When the French gave themselves up\r\n        quietly they had no harm done them, but faith! if they tried to\r\n        outrun a Heelandman they stood but a bad chance, for whash went\r\n        the broadsword!\"--(_Related in August, 1828, as stated in the\r\n        Diary of Volunteer Sergt. Jas. Thompson._)\r\n\r\n\r\n_WOLFESFIELD_\r\n\r\n    \"The hill they climb'd, and halted at its top, of more than mortal\r\n    size.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The horror of the night, the precipice scaled by Wolfe the empire he\r\n    with a handful of men added to England, and the glorious catastrophe\r\n    of contentedly terminating life where his fame began... Ancient story\r\n    may be ransacked, and ostentatious philosophy thrown into the account,\r\n    before an episode can be found to rank with Wolfe's.\"--(_William\r\n    Pitt._)\r\n\r\nThe successful landing at this spot of the English forces, who, in 1759,\r\ninvaded Quebec, no less than its scenery, lends to Wolfesfield peculiar\r\ninterest. Major, afterwards General, John Hale, later on conspicuous for\r\ngallantry during the long and trying siege of Quebec, in 1775-6, was one\r\nof the first men who, in 1759, put his foot on the heights in front of the\r\nlocality where now stands the dwelling, having climbed up the hill by the\r\n_ruisseau St. Denis_, heading the flank Company of the Lascelles or\r\n47th Regiment. General Wolfe made the main body of the army march up,\r\nIndian file, by a pathway which then existed where the high road is at\r\npresent. At the head of this path may yet be seen the remains of the\r\nFrench entrenchments, occupied on that day by a militia guard of 100 men,\r\nchiefly Lorette militiamen, a portion of whom had that very night obtained\r\nleave to go and work on their farms, [224.] who fired at Major Hale's\r\nparty, and then, says an old manuscript, thinking they had to deal with\r\nthe whole English army, they surrendered, with their officer, Capt. De\r\nVergor, who, being wounded, could not escape, and exclaimed, \"Sauvez\r\nvous.\" This was shortly after midnight, and Wolfe, notwithstanding the\r\ngrievous indisposition he was then labouring under, organized a plan to\r\nget up supplies and ammunition from the _bateaux_, this he had\r\naccomplished by four in the morning, when he drew up his men on Marchmont\r\nfield. The sailors of the _bateaux_ were the men employed in carrying\r\nup the provisions and ammunition. Wolfe had grog served out to them as\r\nthey reached, tired and panting, the top of the hill with their loads,\r\nusing to each kind and encouraging words. The crowning success which\r\nfollowed is lengthily described elsewhere. The first house built at\r\nWolfesfield was by Captain Kenelm Chandler, [225] David Munro, Esquire,\r\nwas the next proprietor. The occupant for forty years was an old and\r\nrespected Quebec merchant, well known as the \"King of the Saguenay,\" on\r\naccount of the extensive mills he owned in that region--William Price,\r\nEsq., the respected father of a patriarchal family of sons and daughters.\r\nMr. Price added much to the beauty of the place, which enjoys a most\r\npicturesque river view. In front of the dwelling there is a fine lawn,\r\nshaded by some old thorn and oak trees, with comfortable rustic seats\r\nclose by the ravine St. Denis. This ravine is a favourite locality for\r\nbotanizing excursionists. Wolfesfield, without being as extensive as some\r\nof the surrounding estates, is one of the most charming rural homes Quebec\r\ncan boast of.\r\n\r\nAs these pages are going through the press, we clip from a Quebec journal\r\nthe following tribute to the worth of our late excellent neighbour, Wm.\r\nPrice, Esq., a son of the Laird of Wolfesfield:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _MONUMENT TO THE LATE WILLIAM PRICE, ESQ._\r\n\r\n    \"A large and costly monument in granite is now in course of erection\r\n    at Chicoutimi to the memory of the late Wm. Price. The people of\r\n    Chicoutimi are erecting the monument as a token of their respect and\r\n    admiration for the memory of their late representative in the\r\n    Legislative Assembly of Quebec. The column will be fifty feet in\r\n    height, and will, it is expected, be completed by the month of\r\n    September next. Being placed upon an elevated site, it will be visible\r\n    for many miles up and down the Saguenay river.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THE CAPTURE OF QUEBEC._\r\n\r\n    The following dramatic account of the capture of Quebec is taken from\r\n    the fifth volume of Mr. Carlyle's _Biography of Frederick the Great_:\r\n\r\n    \"Above Quebec, night of September 12-13th, in profound silence, on the\r\n    stream of the St. Lawrence, far away, a notable adventure is going on.\r\n    Wolfe, from two points well above Quebec ('as a last shift, we will\r\n    try that way'), with about five thousand men, is silently descending\r\n    in rafts, with purpose to climb the heights somewhere on this side of\r\n    the city, and be in upon it, if Fate will. An enterprise of almost\r\n    sublime nature; very great, if it can succeed. The cliffs all beset to\r\n    his left hand; Montcalm, in person, guarding Quebec with his main\r\n    strength.\r\n\r\n    Wolfe silently descends; mind made up; thoughts hushed quiet into one\r\n    great thought; in the ripple of the perpetual waters, under the grim\r\n    cliffs and the eternal stars. Conversing, with his people, he was\r\n    heard to recite some passages of Gray's _Elegy_, lately come out\r\n    to those parts; of which, says an ear-witness, he expressed his\r\n    admiration in an enthusiastic degree: 'Ah, these are tones of the\r\n    Eternal Melodies, are not they? A man might thank heaven had he such a\r\n    gift; almost as we might for succeeding here, gentlemen!'\r\n\r\n    Next morning (Thursday, 13th September, 1759), Wolfe, with his 5.000,\r\n    is found to have scrambled up some woody neck in the height, which was\r\n    not quite precipitous; has trailed one cannon with him, the seamen\r\n    busy bringing up another; and by ten of the clock, stands ranked (just\r\n    somewhat in the Frederick way, though on a small scale); ready at all\r\n    points for Montcalm, but refusing to be over-ready. Montcalm on first\r\n    hearing of him, had made haste: _Oui, je les vois où ils ne doivent\r\n    pas être; je vais les écraser_ (to smash them)!\" said he, by way of\r\n    keeping his people in heart. And he marches up beautifully skilful,\r\n    neglecting none of his advantages. His numerous Canadian\r\n    sharpshooters, preliminary Indians in the bushes, with a provoking\r\n    fire. 'Steady!' orders Wolfe; 'from you, not one shot till they are\r\n    within thirty yards!' And Montcalm, volleying and advancing, can get\r\n    no response, more than from Druidic stones; till at thirty yards, the\r\n    stones become vocal--and continued so at a dreadful rate; and in a\r\n    space of seventeen minutes, have blown Montcalm's regulars, and their\r\n    second in command, and their third into ruin and destruction. In about\r\n    seven minutes more the army was done 'English falling on with bayonet,\r\n    Highlanders with claymore'; fierce pursuit, rout total--and Quebec and\r\n    Canada as good as finished. The thing is yet well known to every\r\n    Englishman; and how Wolfe himself died in it, his beautiful death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_ELM GROVE._\r\n\r\nElm Grove, until recently owned, though not inhabited, by the Marquise de\r\nBassano, will be familiar to many, from having been the residence during\r\nthe summer of 1878, of His Holiness the Pope's Apostolic Ablegate--Bishop\r\nConroy.\r\n\r\nThis eminent prelate, prematurely struck down by death at Newfoundland, in\r\nthe midst of his mission of peace and good will to all men spent many\r\nbusy, let us hope pleasant, hours in this cool retreat.\r\n\r\nThe plantation of elms from which this seat takes its name, together with\r\nother trees, conceals the dwelling so entirely from the road, that unless\r\nby entering the grounds no idea can be formed of their beauty and extent;\r\namidst the group of trees there is one of lordly dimensions, in the centre\r\nof the garden. The new dwelling at Elm Grove is a stately, substantial\r\nstructure; its internal arrangement and heating apparatus, indicate\r\ncomfort and that _bien-être_ for which Quebec homes are proverbial. A\r\nwinding, well-wooded approach leads up to the house from the porter's\r\nlodge and main road. From the upper windows an extensive view of\r\nCharlesbourg, Lorette, Beauport, Point Levi and surrounding parishes may\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\nElm Grove, owned for many years by John Saxton Campbell, Esq., was\r\npurchased in 1856 by J. K. Boswell, Esq., who resided there for nearly\r\ntwenty years. John Burstall, Esquire, late of Kirk Ella, has within a few\r\nmonths acquired it from Madame la Marquise de Bassano, and it bids fair\r\nere long to take its place among the first and best kept country seats in\r\nthe environs of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THORNHILL._\r\n\r\n  \".....let us pierce into the midnight depth\r\n  Of yonder grove, of wildest, largest growth,\r\n  That, forming high in air a woodland quire,\r\n  Nods o'er the mount beneath\"\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar feature noticeable about Quebec country seats which\r\nspeaks volumes for their attractiveness as healthy and pleasant retreats;\r\nnot only have they been at all times sought after by wealthy and permanent\r\nresidents, Canadian born, but also by men of European birth, holding for\r\nthe time being the highest position in the country, both under the French\r\nand under the English monarchs. Thus the celebrated Intendant Talon was\r\nthe first owner of Belmont; Intendant Bigot had his luxurious château at\r\nCharlesbourg; Attorney General Ruette D'Auteuil used, near two centuries\r\nback, to spend his summer months at Sillery, where, later on, Bishop\r\nDosquet, a French ecclesiastic, had his pretty villa at Samos (Woodfield).\r\nVaudreuil was also a Canadian land-owner. Later on Governor Murray\r\npurchased extensively on the St. Foy road, amongst others, Belmont and the\r\n\"Sans Bruit\" farm, Governor Haldimand must have his lodge at Montmorenci\r\nFalls, subsequently occupied by the father of our august Queen; Hector\r\nTheophilus Cramahé (afterwards Lieut.-Governor), in 1762, had his estate--\r\nsome 500 acres of cornfield and meadows--at Cap Rouge, now Meadowbank,\r\nowned by Lt.-Col. Chs. Andrew Shears. The Prime Minister of Canada, in\r\n1854, and a late Governor of British Guiana, Sir Francis Hincks, following\r\nin the footsteps of Sir Dominick Daly, must needs locate himself on the\r\nSt. Lewis road, and in order to be close to his chief, the late Earl of\r\nElgin, then residing at Spencer Wood, the Premier selected and purchased\r\nThornhill, across the road, one of the most picturesque country seats in\r\nthe neighbourhood. You barely, as you pass, catch a glimpse of its\r\noutlines as it rests under tall, cone-like firs on the summit of a\r\nhillock, to which access is had through a handsomely laid out circuitous\r\napproach between two hills. An extensive fruit and vegetable garden lies\r\nto the east of the house; a hawthorn hedge dotted here and there with some\r\ngraceful young maple and birch trees, fringes the roadside; a thorn\r\nshrubbery of luxuriant growth encircles the plantation of evergreens along\r\nthe side of the mound which slopes down to the road, furnishing a splendid\r\ncroquet lawn. One of the chief beauties of the landscape is the occasional\r\nglimpses of the Grande Allée and Spencer Wood, obtained from the house.\r\nThe dwelling was erected many years ago by Alexander Simpson, Esq., then\r\nManager of the Bank of Montreal, at Quebec. Forming a portion of it to the\r\nwest, and looking towards Charlesbourg, there is a snug English-looking\r\nlittle nest, \"Woodside,\" with the prettiest of thorn and willow hedges.\r\nThornhill has exchanged hands, and been for many years the seat of\r\nArchibald Campbell, Esq., P.S.C., at Quebec.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SPENCER WOOD._\r\n\r\nOn the South side of the St. Louis road, past Wolfe and Montcalm's famed\r\nbattle-field, two miles from the city walls, lies, embowered in verdure,\r\nthe most picturesque domain of Sillery--one might say of Canada--Spencer\r\nWood. [226]\r\n\r\nThis Celebrated Vice-Regal Lodge was (1780-96) known as Powell Place, when\r\nowned by General Henry Watson Powell. It took its name of Spencer Wood\r\nfrom the Right Honorable Spencer Perceval, [227] the illustrious relative\r\nof the Hon. Henry Michael Perceval, whose family possessed it from 1815 to\r\n1833, when it was sold to the late Henry Atkinson, Esquire, an eminent and\r\nwealthy Quebec merchant. Hon. Mr. Perceval, member of the Executive and\r\nLegislative Council, had been H. M.'s Collector of Customs at Quebec for\r\nmany years, and until his death which took place at sea, 12th October,\r\n1829. The Percevals lived for many years in affluence in this sylvan\r\nretreat. Of their elegant receptions Quebecers still cherish pleasant\r\nreminiscences. Like several villas of England and France, Spencer Wood had\r\nits periods of splendor alternated by days of loneliness and neglect,\r\nshort though they were. Spencer Wood, until 1849, comprised the adjoining\r\nproperty of Spencer Grange. Mr. Atkinson that year sold the largest half\r\nof his country seat--Spencer Wood--to the Government, as a gubernatorial\r\nresidence for the hospitable and genial Earl of Elgin, reserving the\r\nsmaller half (now owned by the writer), on which he built conservatories,\r\nvineries, a pinery, orchid house, &c., far more extensive than those of\r\nSpencer Wood proper. Though the place was renowned for its magnificence\r\nand princely hospitality in the days of Lord Elgin, there are amongst the\r\nliving plenty to testify to the fact that the lawns, walks, gardens, and\r\nconservatories were never kept up with the same intelligent taste and\r\nlavish expenditure as they were during the sixteen years (1833-1849) when\r\nthis country seat owned for its master Mr. Atkinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THE LATE HONORABLE MRS. M. H. PERCEVAL. FORMERLY OF SPENCER WOOD,\r\n    QUEBEC._\r\n\r\n    Through the kindness of Mrs. Peter Sheppard, of Quebec, we are enabled\r\n    to furnish some further particulars touching the estimable and\r\n    accomplished lady who, during the protracted sojourn of her family at\r\n    Spencer Wood, seems to have won the hearts of all those admitted to\r\n    her charmed circle some fifty years ago. Mrs. Sheppard [228] not only\r\n    renders to the worth of her lamented friend a merited tribute, she\r\n    also furnishes a curious page of Quebec history, Quebec festivities in\r\n    the olden times, which may interest our readers. \"The Honorable\r\n    Michael H. Perceval was closely connected with the Earl of Egmont's\r\n    family, who were Percevals. The \"Spencer\" was borrowed from the Earl's\r\n    eldest son \"Spencer;\" the name was given to their beautiful domain\r\n    purchased from old LeHoullier about 1815, as well as to their eldest\r\n    son, Col. (now Major General) Spencer Perceval, who was here in\r\n    garrison in 1840, in the Coldstream Guards, as well as his uncle, Col.\r\n    Perceval, also serving in the Guards. When a girl in my teens, many\r\n    happy days did I spend in the Perceval family, who were as\r\n    passionately fond of music, as I then was. They had \"at homes\" every\r\n    Monday, one week for dancing, the next for music, (the latter I never\r\n    missed attending, to play on the harp,) they had also grand dinners\r\n    _de cérémonie_. Amongst the _habitués_ I can yet recall some names;\r\n    Hon. Mathew Bell and lady; (Mrs. B. was a Miss McKenzie, of Three\r\n    Rivers,) Miss Bell (Mrs. Walker,) Sir John Pownal, the Montizamberts,\r\n    Judge Kerr and Misses Kerr, Miss Uniacke, the Duchesnays, the\r\n    Vanfelsons, De Gaspés, Babys and others. (I may be wrong in quoting\r\n    some names after half a century.)\r\n\r\n    Mr. Perceval, was a member of the Legislative Council, as well as\r\n    Collector of Customs, an imperial appointment which yielded him £8000\r\n    in fees per annum. English and French society were equally welcome\r\n    under his hospitable roof. His beautiful and accomplished wife, was\r\n    the eldest daughter of Sir Charles Flower, Lord Mayor of London, in\r\n    1809--had filled the position of Lady Mayoress, when 18 years of age,\r\n    her father being a widower; she brought her husband £40,000 and\r\n    subsequently inherited £100,000. She was eminently fitted to grace\r\n    Spencer Wood--her beauty, her refined and cordial manners made her\r\n    receptions eminently attractive. Her education was perfect, she was\r\n    mistress of four languages, English, French, Italian and Latin, which\r\n    studies she took great trouble in keeping up and which she herself\r\n    taught to her children, ten in number, besides teaching them the\r\n    piano, the harp and drawing. Instead of fancy work the young ladies\r\n    were taught to repair their clothes and do plain sewing; this did not\r\n    prevent them from making most brilliant matches. The family left\r\n    Spencer Wood in 1828, to spend a year in Italy, at Florence, intending\r\n    to return, but the Hon. M. H. Perceval, died at sea on the 12th Oct.,\r\n    1829, and the family never returned.\r\n\r\n    The daughters married as follows: the eldest, Eliza, was wedded to Sir\r\n    George Denys, Bart.; the second, Caroline, to Col. Alexander Houstoun,\r\n    of Clerkington; the third, Isabella, to a wealthy French nobleman,\r\n    Baron de Veauce; the fourth, Mary Jane, to Sir James Matheson, Bart.;\r\n    the fifth died at the age of 18. The eldest son [229] \"Spencer\" is a\r\n    General officer. There were several other sons; George Ramsay, who\r\n    entered the army, Michael Henry and Col. Charles Perceval.\r\n\r\n    I can recall the time also when Lady Dalhousie and Mrs. Sheppard, of\r\n    Woodfield, would come to Spencer Wood, in their botanizing excursions.\r\n    Spencer Wood, later on, was also a favorite resort of Lady Aylmer, in\r\n    1832, whilst at an earlier period, the Duke of Richmond's family, in\r\n    1818, used to come and ramble about the grounds, lunching there with\r\n    all the junior folks.\r\n\r\n    This charming and beloved lady, my old friend, Ann Perceval, died at\r\n    Lewes Castle, Stornaway. Scotland, the seat of her son in law, Sir\r\n    James Matheson, on the 23rd Nov., 1876, most deservedly regretted, at\r\n    the very advanced age of eighty-seven years.\"--24 January, 1877.\r\n\r\nSpencer Wood garden is described in London's _Encyclopedia of Gardening_,\r\npage 341, and also in the _Gardener's Magazine_ for 1837, at page 467. Its\r\nornate style of culture, which made it a show-place for all strangers\r\nvisiting Quebec, was mainly due to the scientific and tasty arrangements\r\nof an eminent landscape gardener, M. P. Lowe, [230] now in charge of the\r\nCataraqui conservatories.\r\n\r\nWell can we recall the time when this lordly demesne extended from\r\nWolfefield, adjoining Marchmont, to the meandering Belle-Borne brook,\r\nwhich glides past the porter's lodge at Woodfield, due west, the historic\r\nstream _Ruisseau Saint Denis_, up which clambered the British hero,\r\nWolfe, to conquer or die, intersecting it at Thornhill. It was then a\r\nsplendid old seat of more than one hundred acres, a fit residence for the\r\nproudest nobleman England might send us as Viceroy--enclosed east and west\r\nbetween two streamlets, hidden from the highway by a dense growth of oak,\r\nmaple, dark pines and firs--the forest primeval--letting in here and there\r\nthe light of heaven on its labyrinthine avenues; a most striking\r\nlandscape, blending the sombre verdure of its hoary trees with the soft\r\ntints of its velvety sloping lawn, fit for a ducal palace. An elfish plot\r\nof a flower garden, alas! how much dwarfed, then stood in rear of the\r\ndwelling to the north, it once enjoyed the privilege of attracting many\r\neyes. It had also an extensive and well-kept fruit and vegetable garden,\r\nenlivened with flower beds, the centre of which was adorned with the\r\nloveliest possible circular fount in white marble, supplied with the\r\ncrystal element from the Belle-Borne rill by a hidden aqueduct;\r\nconservatories, graperies, peach and forcing houses, pavilions\r\npicturesquely hung over the yawning precipice on two headlands, one\r\nlooking towards Sillery, the other towards the Island of Orleans, the\r\nscene of many a cosy tea-party; bowers, rustic chairs _perdues_ among\r\nthe groves, a superb bowling green and archery grounds. The mansion itself\r\ncontained an exquisite collection of paintings from old masters, a well-\r\nselected library of rare and standard works, illuminated Roman missals,\r\nrich portfolios with curious etchings, marble busts, quaint statuettes,\r\nmedals and medallions, _objets de vertu_ purchased by the millionaire\r\nproprietor during a four years' residence in Italy, France and Germany.\r\nSuch we remember Spencer Wood in its palmiest days, when it was the ornate\r\nhome of a man of taste, the late Henry Atkinson, Esquire, the President of\r\nthe Horticultural Society of Quebec.\r\n\r\nMay I be pardoned, for lingering lovingly on this old spot, recalling\r\n\"childhood scenes\" of one dear to me and mine!\r\n\r\nThe following, written by a valued old friend of Mr. Atkinson, is dated\r\nBrighton, England:\r\n\r\n    On a sketch of Spencer Wood sent to the writer (Miss A.), with her\r\n    album, Oct. 18, 1848.\r\n\r\n    Dear Spencer Wood! What a group of pleasing remembrances are clustered\r\n    around me as I gaze upon this visible image and type of thee. Thy\r\n    classic lawn, with its antiquated oaks and solemn pines; thy wood-\r\n    crowned cliffs and promontories, with the sparkling sunlight reflected\r\n    on a thousand sheaves from the broad surface of Jacques Cartier's\r\n    river, hundreds of feet below. And then the quiet repose of thy ample\r\n    mansion, with its stores of art and models of taste within and\r\n    without; thy forest shades, thy gardens, thy flowers and thy fruit.\r\n    But most of all, thy gay and happy inmates, their glad and joyous\r\n    hearts beating with generous emotions, and their countenances\r\n    brightened with the welcome smile. Ah! how I seem to hear, as in time\r\n    past I have heard, their lively prattle, or their merry laugh echoing\r\n    across the lawn, or through the flower garden, or along the winding\r\n    paths down the steep slope to the pavilion.\r\n\r\n    And can it be that I shall never again realize these happy scenes! I\r\n    would fain hope otherwise; but life is a changeful drama, and time\r\n    fleeting; this world is _not_ our home.\r\n\r\n    Adieu, then, dear friends. May God's blessing ever rest upon you; and\r\n    should it be His providence that we meet not again here, may we all so\r\n    use His dealings with us in this disciplinary state that we may be\r\n    sure to meet.\r\n\r\n      Brighton, Dec. 20th. In memory of some pleasant moments.\r\n\r\n      E. E. DOUGLASS.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the century Spencer Wood, as previously stated, was\r\nknown as Powell Place. His Excellency Sir James Henry Craig spent there\r\nthe summers of 1808-9-10. Even the healthy air of Powell Place failed to\r\ncure him of gout and dropsy. A curious letter from Sir James to his\r\nsecretary and _chargé d'affaires_ in London, H. W. Ryland, Esquire, dated\r\n\"Powell Place, 6th August, 1810,\" has been, among others, preserved by the\r\nhistorian Robert Christie. It alludes in rather unparliamentary language\r\nto the _coup d'état_ which had on the 19th March, 1810, consigned to a\r\nQuebec dungeon three of the most prominent members of the Legislature,\r\nMessrs. Bédard, Taschereau and Blanchet, together with Mr. Lefrançois, the\r\nprinter of the _Canadien_ newspaper, for certain comments in that journal\r\non Sir James' colonial policy. Sir James had spent the greatest part of\r\nhis life in the army, actively battling against France; a Frenchman for\r\nhim was a traditional enemy. This unfortunate idea seems more than once to\r\nhave inspired his colonial policy with regard to the descendants of\r\nFrenchmen whom he ruled.\r\n\r\nBorn at Gibraltar, of Scotch parents, James Henry Craig entered the\r\nEnglish service in 1763 at the age of 15, and on many occasions\r\ndistinguished himself by his courage. During the war of the American\r\nrevolution he served in Canada, and was present at the unfortunate affair\r\nof Saratoga.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _SIR JAMES CRAIG TO MR. RYLAND._\r\n\r\n    QUEBEC, Powell Place, 6th August, 1810.\r\n\r\n    My Dear Ryland,--Till I took my pen in my hand I thought I had a great\r\n    deal to say to you, and now I am mostly at a loss for a subject. * * *\r\n    We have remained very quiet; whatever is going on is silently. I have\r\n    no reason to think, however, that any change has taken place in the\r\n    public mind; _that_ I believe remains in the same state. Bishop\r\n    Plessis, on the return from his tour, acknowledged to me that he had\r\n    reason to think that some of his _curés_ had not behaved quite as\r\n    they ought to have done; he is now finishing the remainder of his\r\n    visitations.\r\n\r\n    Blanchette and Taschereau are both released on account of ill-health;\r\n    the former is gone to Kamouraska to bathe, the latter was only let out\r\n    a few days ago. He sent to the Chief Justice (Sewell) to ask if he\r\n    would allow him to call on him, who answered, by all means. The Chief\r\n    Justice is convinced he is perfectly converted. He assured him that he\r\n    felt it to be his duty to take any public occasion, by any act\r\n    whatever that he could point out, to show his contrition and the sense\r\n    he entertained of his former conduct.\r\n\r\n    He told the Chief Justice in conversation that Blanchette came and\r\n    consulted him on the subject of publishing the paper, \"Prenez vous par\r\n    le bout du nez,\" and that having agreed that it would be very improper\r\n    that it should appear, they went to Bédard, between whom and\r\n    Blanchette there were very high words on the occasion. I know not what\r\n    Panet is about, I have never heard one word of or about him. In short,\r\n    I really have nothing to tell you, nor do I imagine that I shall have,\r\n    till I hear from you. You may suppose how anxious I shall be till that\r\n    takes place. We have fixed the time for about the 10th September; till\r\n    then I shall not come to any final resolution with respect to the\r\n    bringing the three delinquents to trial or not. I am, however,\r\n    inclined to avoid it, so is the B----; the C. J. is rather, I think,\r\n    inclined to the other side, though aware of the inconvenience that may\r\n    arise from it. Blanchette and Taschereau have both, in the most\r\n    unequivocal terms, acknowledged the criminality of their conduct, and\r\n    it will be hinted that if Bédard will do the same it may be all that\r\n    will be required of them; at present his language is that he has done\r\n    nothing wrong, and that he does not care how long he is kept in\r\n    prison.\r\n\r\n    We have begun upon the road to the townships (the Craig Road, through\r\n    the Eastern Townships) * * * We shall get money enough, especially as\r\n    we hope to finish it at a third of what it would have cost if we would\r\n    have employed the country people. (It was made by soldiers.)\r\n\r\n    The scoundrels of the Lower Town have begun their clamour already, and\r\n    I should scarcely be surprised if the House should ask, when they\r\n    meet, by what authority I have cut a road without their permission.\r\n    The road begins at St. Giles and will end at the township of Shipton.\r\n\r\n      Yours most faithfully,\r\n\r\n      (Signed,) J. H. CRAIG.\r\n\r\n      (History of Canada, Christie, vol. VI., p. 128.)\r\n\r\nVery different, and we hope more correct, views are now promulgated on\r\ncolonial matters from Powell Place.\r\n\r\nIf Sir James, wincing under bodily pain, could write angry letters, there\r\nwere occasions on which the \"rank and fashion\" of the city received from\r\nhim the sweetest epistles imaginable. The 10th of August of each year (his\r\nbirthday, perhaps) as he informs us in another letter, was sacred to\r\nrustic enjoyment, conviviality and the exchange of usual courtesies, which\r\nnone knew better how to dispense than the sturdy old soldier.\r\n\r\nThe English traveller, John Lambert, thus notices it in his interesting\r\nnarrative in 1808:--\"Sir James Craig resided in summer at a country house\r\nabout four or five miles from Quebec, and went to town every morning to\r\ntransact business. This residence is called Powell Place, and is\r\ndelightfully situated in a neat plantation on the border of the bank which\r\noverlooks the St. Lawrence, not far from the spot where General Wolfe\r\nlanded and ascended to the heights of Abraham. Sir James gave a splendid\r\nbreakfast _al fresco_ at this place in 1809 to all the principal\r\ninhabitants of Quebec, and the following day he allowed his servants and\r\ntheir acquaintances to partake of a similar entertainment at his\r\nexpense.\"--(Lambert's Travels, 1808, p. 310.)\r\n\r\nSpencer Wood has ever been a favourite resort for our Governors--Sir James\r\nCraig--Lord Elgin--Sir Edmund Walker Head--Lord Monk--Lord Lisgar, and\r\nLord Dufferin on his arrival in 1872, none prized it so highly, none\r\nrendered it more attractive than the Earl of Elgin. Of his _fêtes\r\nchampêtres_, _recherchés_ dinners, _château_ balls, a pleasant remembrance\r\nstill lingers in the memory of many Quebecers and others. Several\r\ncircumstances added to the charms and comfort of Spencer Wood in his day.\r\nOn one side of St. Louis Road stood the gubernatorial residence, on the\r\nopposite side at Thornhill, dwelt the Prime Minister, Sir Francis Hincks.\r\nOver the vice-regal \"walnuts and wine,\" how many knotty state questions\r\nhave been discussed, how many despatches settled, how many political\r\npoints adjusted in the stormy days which saw the abolition of the\r\nSeignioral Tenure and Clergy Reserves. At one of his brilliant\r\npostprandial speeches,--Lord Elgin was much happier at this style of\r\noratory than his successor, Sir Edmund Head,--the noble Earl is reported\r\nto have said, alluding to Spencer Wood, \"Not only would I spend here the\r\nrest of my life, but after my death, I should like my bones to rest in\r\nthis beautiful spot;\" and still China and India had other scenes, other\r\ntriumphs, and his Sovereign, other rewards for the successful statesman.\r\n\r\nSir Edmund Head's sojourn at Spencer Wood was marked by a grievous family\r\nbereavement; his only son, a promising youth of nineteen summers, was, in\r\n1858, accidentally drowned in the St. Maurice, at Three Rivers, while\r\nbathing. This domestic affliction threw a pall over the remainder of the\r\nexistence of His Excellency, already darkened by bodily disease. Seclusion\r\nand quiet were desirable to him.\r\n\r\nA small private gate still exists at Spencer Grange, which at the request\r\nof the sorrowful father was opened through the adjoining property with the\r\npermission of the proprietor. Each week His Excellency, with his amiable\r\nlady, stealing a few moments from the burthen of affairs of State, would\r\nthus walk through unobserved to drop a silent tear on the green grave at\r\nMount Hermon, in which were entombed all the hopes of a noble house. On\r\nthe 12th March, 1860, on a wintry evening, whilst the castle was a blaze\r\nof light and powdered footmen hurried through its sounding corridors, to\r\nrelieve of their fur coats and mufflers His Excellency's guests asked at a\r\nstate dinner that night--Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir Geo. E. Cartier, Mr.\r\nPennefather and others--the alarm of fire was sounded, and in a couple of\r\nhours, of the magnificent pile a few charred ruins only remained. There\r\nwas no State dinner that night.\r\n\r\nOne of the last acts of the Ministry in retiring in 1861, was the signing\r\nof the contract to rebuild Spencer Wood. The appropriation was a very\r\nniggardly one, in view of the size of the structure required as a vice-\r\nregal residence. All meretricious ornaments in the design were of course\r\nleft out. A square building, two hundred feet by fifty, was erected with\r\nthe main entrance, in rear, on the site of the former lovely flower\r\ngarden. The location of the entrance and consequent sacrifice of the\r\nflower garden for a court, left the river front of the dwelling for the\r\nprivate use of the inmates of the _Château_ by excluding the public.\r\nLord Monk, the new Governor-General, took possession of the new mansion\r\nand had a plantation of fir and other trees added to conceal the east end\r\nfrom public gaze. Many happy days were spent at Spencer Wood by His\r\nLordship and family, whose private secretary, Denis Godley, Esq., occupied\r\nthe picturesque cottage \"Bagatelle,\" facing the Holland Road, on the\r\nSpencer Grange property. If illustrious names on the Spencer Wood\r\nVisitor's Register could enhance the interest the place may possess,\r\nforemost, one might point to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, visiting in 1860\r\nthe site probably more than once surveyed and admired, in 1791-4, by his\r\ngrand-father, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, in his drives round Quebec,\r\nwith the fascinating Baroness de St. Laurent. Conspicuous among all those\r\nfamiliar with the portals of Spencer Wood, may be mentioned other Royal\r\nPrinces--the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Arthur, Princess Louise, Prince\r\nLeopold; with Dukes and Earls--the Duke of Newcastle, Manchester,\r\nBuckingham, Argyll, Athol. Sutherland, Prince Napoleon, Generals Grant,\r\nSherman, &c.\r\n\r\nSince Confederation, Spencer Wood has been successively tenanted by Sir.\r\nN. F. Belleau, Lieutenant-Governor Caron, Lieutenant-Governor Letellier de\r\nSt. Just, and Lieutenant-Governor Robitaille, the present occupant of the\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nTo the late Lieut.-Governor Letellier is due the initiation of the\r\n_soirées littéraires_, which united under his hospitable roof the literary\r\ntalent of the Ancient Capital, and his successor, Lieut.-Governor\r\nRobitaille, not only followed this enlightened course, but also added\r\n_soirées musicales_ and _artistiques_.\r\n\r\nSpencer Wood was not included in the schedule and division of property\r\nhanded over by the Dominion Government to the Province of Quebec--it was,\r\nhowever, about that time presented as a gift to our province, solely as a\r\ngubernatorial residence--as such to be held, and consequently cannot be\r\nsold by the Government of the Province of Quebec.\r\n\r\n    HENRY WATSON POWELL was commissioned a Lieutenant in the 46th Foot,\r\n    March 10th, 1753. He was promoted to a captaincy in the 2nd Battalion\r\n    of the 11th Foot, September 2nd, 1756, but upon that battalion's being\r\n    detached from the 11th and renumbered in 1758, his regimental number\r\n    became the 64th. He served in the expedition against the French West\r\n    India Islands in 1759, and went with his regiment to America in 1768.\r\n    June 2nd, 1770, he became Major of the 38th Foot, and July 23rd, 1771,\r\n    Lieutenant-Colonel of the 53rd Foot, which was then stationed at\r\n    Minorca. He accompanied his corps to Canada in the spring of 1776, and\r\n    on June 10th of that year, a few days after his arrival, Sir Guy\r\n    Carleton appointed him a Brigadier General and assigned him to the 2nd\r\n    Brigade, which consisted of the 34th, 53rd and 20th Regiments. When\r\n    Gen. Gordon's brigade was broken up on the death of that officer,\r\n    August 1st, 1776, the 62nd was added to Powell's brigade, and in\r\n    November of that year, upon General Nesbit's death, Gen. Powell was\r\n    transferred to the command of the 1st Brigade, consisting of the 9th,\r\n    47th, 31st and 21st Regiments, save that the 53rd was substituted for\r\n    the 21st. Gen. Powell served under Gen. Carleton in 1776, and the next\r\n    year accompanied Burgoyne. In organizing the troops for Burgoyne's\r\n    expedition in 1777, Gen. Powell was assigned to the 2nd Brigade,\r\n    consisting of the 20th, 21st and 62nd Regiments.  The 62nd was left at\r\n    Ticonderoga, however with Prince Frederick's (German) Regiment and a\r\n    portion of Captain Borthwick's company of the Royal Artillery July 5th\r\n    when the Americans evacuated that fort, and August 10th Gen. Powell\r\n    was sent back to assume command of that post, his regiment, the 53rd,\r\n    being also ordered to relieve the 62nd. Though he successfully\r\n    repelled the American Col. Brown's attack on Ticonderoga and for four\r\n    days maintained a gallant defence, the enemy retreating September\r\n    22nd, yet inasmuch as a considerable part of four companies of the\r\n    53rd were surprised in the old French lines and at the outposts by the\r\n    American advance, and a number of American Prisoners were recaptured,\r\n    the affair was not one of unmixed satisfaction to either side.\r\n\r\n    When the toils of adversity began to tighten round Burgoyne in October\r\n    Gen. Powell was sorely puzzled as to his duty for though he was out of\r\n    Sir Guy Carleton's military jurisdiction yet that officer was\r\n    accessible while Burgoyne, his own proper commander was not. The\r\n    following letter, there fore, written by Sir Guy to Gen. Powell, after\r\n    Burgoyne's surrender, though in ignorance of that event, throws some\r\n    light upon the awkwardness of Powell's situation. The letter reads as\r\n    follows:--\r\n\r\n    QUEBEC, the 20th October, 1777.\r\n\r\n    SIR,--I have this moment received your letter of the 19th instant,\r\n    wherein you demand orders from me for your guidance in your present\r\n    emergency. It is impossible that I should give orders to you, not\r\n    alone because the post you are in has been taken out of my command,\r\n    but the distance is too great for my being able to judge of the\r\n    situation of Gen Burgoyne or of the exigencies of the place you are at\r\n    which must depend upon the other, as if you were subject to my\r\n    commands ignorant as I am of the strength or weakness of your post, I\r\n    should under all the other circumstances think it best for His\r\n    Majesty's service to suffer you to act by your own judgment, so you\r\n    will there fore easily see the greater necessity there is as matters\r\n    are for my leaving you to pursue such steps, as shall be suggested to\r\n    you by your own prudence and reason. I can only recommend to you not\r\n    to balance between two opposite measures, whereby you may be disabled\r\n    from following the one or the other with advantage but that either you\r\n    prepare, with vigour to put to place in such a situation as to be able\r\n    to make the longest and most resolute defence or that you prepare in\r\n    time to abandon it with all the stores while your retreat may be\r\n    certain. Your own sense will tell you that this latter would be a most\r\n    pernicious measure if there be still hopes of General Burgoyne coming\r\n    to your post.\r\n\r\n    I am, sir, &c.\r\n\r\n    Though Sir Guy did not feel at liberty to issue orders to Gen. Powell\r\n    yet he immediately despatched Gen. Maclean with the 31st regiment, the\r\n    Royal Highland Emigrants and a detachment of artillery with four guns\r\n    to take post and entrench at Chimney Point, near Crown Point, in order\r\n    to keep up communication with Ticonderoga. Two or three weeks later\r\n    Gen. Powell abandoned Ticonderoga and withdrew to Canada. After a\r\n    short tarry at St. John's he was posted at Montreal, where he\r\n    commanded during the winter of 1777-8. Then he was stationed at St\r\n    John's and in the autumn of 1780, after Lieut.-Colonel Bolton's\r\n    unfortunate loss on Lake Ontario, we find him in command of the upper\r\n    posts with his headquarters at Niagara. By Gen. Haldimand's order of\r\n    October 21st, 1782, Brig.-Gen. Maclean was assigned to the command of\r\n    the upper posts, and Gen. Powell was appointed commandant of Quebec.\r\n    How long he remained at Quebec has not been ascertained, but in 1780\r\n    he bought a fine estate on the St. Lewis Road, about two and a half\r\n    miles from Quebec to which he gave the name of Powell Place and which\r\n    he did not dispose of until 1796, when he sold it to Francis\r\n    Lehoullier. This place was subsequently known as Spencer Wood, but it\r\n    has since been divided, the larger portion being still known as\r\n    Spencer Wood, and serving as the residence of the Lieutenant-Governor,\r\n    while the smaller portion consisting of about forty acres and known as\r\n    Spencer Grange, belongs to and is the property of J. M. LeMoine,\r\n    President of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec.\r\n\r\n    Gen. Powell became a Colonel in the army February 19th, 1779; a Major\r\n    General, November 20th, 1782; Colonel of the 69th Foot, April 16th,\r\n    1792; Colonel of the 15th Foot, June 20th, 1794 (not April 20th, as\r\n    printed in Burgoyne's Orderly Book); A Lieutenant-General, May 3rd,\r\n    1796, and a General, January 1st, 1801. He died at an advanced age at\r\n    Lyme, England, July 14th, 1814.\r\n\r\n    Army Lists--Gentleman's Magazine, vol. 84, p. 190; Burgoyne's Orderly\r\n    Book, p. 10; Hadden's Journal; Haldimand Papers; LeMoine's Maple\r\n    Leaves, 3rd series; J. M. LeMoine's Title Deeds.\" (_From Gen. Horatio\r\n    Rogers' Notes on HADDEN'S JOURNAL of Burgoyne's Campaign_, 1776.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    _A FÊTE CHAMPÊTRE AT POWELL PLACE._\r\n\r\n    (From the French of P. A. DeGaspé.)\r\n\r\n    \"At half-past eight A.M., on a bright August morning (I say a bright\r\n    one, for such had lighted up this welcome _fête champêtre_ during\r\n    three consecutive years), the _élite_ of the Quebec _beau monde_ left\r\n    the city to attend Sir James Craig's kind invitation. Once opposite\r\n    Powell Place (now Spencer Wood) the guests left their vehicles on the\r\n    main road, and plunged into a dense forest, following a serpentine\r\n    avenue which led to a delightful cottage in full view of the majestic\r\n    St. Lawrence; the river here appears to flow past amidst luxuriant\r\n    green bowers which line its banks. Small tables for four, for six, for\r\n    eight guests are laid out facing the cottage, on a platform of planed\r\n    deals--this will shortly serve as a dancing floor _al fresco_; as the\r\n    guests successively arrive, they form in parties to partake of a\r\n    _déjeuner en famille_. I say _en famille_, for an _aide-de-camp_ and a\r\n    few waiters excepted, no one interferes with the small groups clubbed\r\n    together to enjoy their early repast, of which cold meat, radishes,\r\n    bread, tea and coffee form the staples. Those whose appetites are\r\n    appeased make room for new comers, and amuse themselves strolling\r\n    under the shade of trees. At ten the cloth is removed; the company are\r\n    all on the _qui vive_. The cottage, like the enchanted castle in the\r\n    Opera of Zemira and Azor, only awaits the magic touch of a fairy; a\r\n    few minutes elapse, and the chief entrance is thrown open; Little King\r\n    Craig followed by a brilliant staff, enters. Simultaneously an\r\n    invisible orchestra, located high amidst the dense foliage of large\r\n    trees, strikes up \"God Save the King.\" All stand uncovered, in solemn\r\n    silence, in token of respect to the national anthem of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n    \"The magnates press forward to pay their respects to His Excellency\r\n    Those who do not intend to \"trip the light fantastic toe\" take seats\r\n    on the platform where his Excellency sits in state; an A.D.C. calls\r\n    out, _gentlemen, take your partners_, and the dance begins.\r\n\r\n    \"Close on sixty winters have run by since that day, when I,\r\n    indefatigable dancer, figured in a country dance of thirty couples. My\r\n    footsteps, which now seem to me like lead, scarcely then left a trace\r\n    behind them. All the young hearts who enlivened this gay meeting of\r\n    other days are mouldering in their tombs, even _she_, the most\r\n    beautiful of them all, _la belle des belles_--she, the partner of\r\n    my joys and of my sorrows--she who on that day accepted in the\r\n    circling dance, for the first time, this hand, which two years after\r\n    was to lead her to the hymeneal altar--yes, even she has been swept\r\n    away by the tide of death. [231]  May not I also say, with Ossian,\r\n    'Why art thou sad, son of Fingal! Why grows the cloud of thy soul! the\r\n    sons of future years shall pass away, another race shall arise! The\r\n    people are like the waves of the ocean, like the leaves of woody\r\n    Morven--they pass away in the rustling blast, and other leaves lift\r\n    their green heads on high.'\r\n\r\n    \"After all, why, indeed, yield up my soul in sadness? The children of\r\n    the coming generation will pass rapidly, and a new one will take its\r\n    place! Men are like the surges of the ocean, they resemble the leaves\r\n    which hang over the groves of my manor, autumnal storms cause them to\r\n    fall, but new and equally green ones each spring replace the fallen\r\n    ones. Why should I sorrow? Eighty-six children, grand-children, and\r\n    great-grand-children, will mourn the fell of the old oak when the\r\n    breach of the Almighty shall smite it. Should I have the good fortune\r\n    to find mercy before the Sovereign Judge: should it be vouchsafed to\r\n    me to meet again the angel of virtue who cheered the few happy days I\r\n    passed in this vale of sorrow, we will both pray together for the\r\n    numerous progeny we left behind us. But let us revert to the merry\r\n    meeting previously alluded to. It is half-past two in the afternoon,\r\n    we are gaily going through the figures of a country-dance, 'Speed the\r\n    plough' perhaps, when the music stops short, everyone is taken aback,\r\n    and wonders at the cause of interruption. The arrival of two prelates,\r\n    Bishop Plessis and Bishop Mountain, gave us the solution of the\r\n    enigma; an aide-de-camp had motioned to the bandmaster to stop on\r\n    noticing the entrance of the two high dignitaries of the respective\r\n    churches. The dance was interrupted whilst they were there, and was\r\n    resumed on their departure. Sir James had introduced this point of\r\n    etiquette from the respect he entertained for their persons.\r\n\r\n    \"At three the loud sound of a hunters horn is heard in the distance;\r\n    all follow His Excellency in a path cut through the then virgin forest\r\n    of Powell Place. Some of the guests from the length of the walk, began\r\n    to think that Sir James had intended those who had not danced to take\r\n    a \"constitutional\" before dinner, when, on rounding an angle a huge\r\n    table, canopied with green boughs, groaning under the weight of\r\n    dishes, struck on their view--a grateful oasis in the desert. Monsieur\r\n    Petit, the _chef de cuisine_, had surpassed himself, like Vatel,\r\n    I imagine he would have committed suicide had he failed to achieve the\r\n    triumph by which he intended to elicit our praise. Nothing could\r\n    exceed in magnificence, in sumptuousness this repast--such was the\r\n    opinion not only of Canadians, for whom such displays were new, but\r\n    also of the European guests, though there was a slight drawback to the\r\n    perfect enjoyment of the dishes--_the materials which composed them\r\n    we could not recognize_, so great was the artistic skill, so\r\n    wonderful the manipulations of Monsieur Petit, the French cook.\r\n\r\n    \"The Bishops left about half an hour after dinner, when dancing was\r\n    resumed with an increasing ardor, but the cruel mammas were getting\r\n    concerned respecting certain sentimental walks which the daughters\r\n    were enjoying after sunset. They ordered them home, if not with their\r\n    menacing attitude with which the goddess Calypso is said to have\r\n    spoken to her nymphs, at least with frowns; so said the gay young\r\n    _cavaliers_. By nine o'clock, all had re-entered Quebec.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_SPENCER GRANGE._\r\n\r\n  \"Retirement, rural quiet, friendship, books\"--_Thomson_\r\n\r\nWhen Spencer Wood became the gubernatorial residence, its owner (the late\r\nHy. Atkinson) reserved the smaller half, Spencer Grange, some forty acres,\r\ndivided off by a high brick wall and fence, and terminating to the east in\r\na river frontage of one acre. A small latticed bower facing the St.\r\nLawrence overhangs the cliff, close to where the Belle Borne rill--nearly\r\ndry during the summer months--rushes down the bank to Spencer Cove, in\r\nspring and autumn,--a ribbon of fleecy whiteness. To the south, it is\r\nbounded by Woodfield, and reaches to the north at a point opposite the\r\nroad called Stuart's road which intersects Holland farm, leading from the\r\nSt. Lewis to the Ste. Foye highway. The English landscape style was\r\nadopted in the laying out of the flower garden and grounds; some majestic\r\nold trees were left here and there through the lawns; three clumps of\r\nmaple and red oak in the centre of the meadows to the west of the house\r\ngrouped for effect; fences, carefully hidden away in the surrounding\r\ncopses; hedges, buildings, walks and trees brought in here and there to\r\nharmonize with the eye and furnish on a few acres a perfect epitome of a\r\nwoodland scene. The whole place is girt round by a zone of tall pine,\r\nbeech, maple and red oaks, whose deep green foliage, when lit up by the\r\nrays of the setting or rising sun, assume tints of most dazzling\r\nbrightness,--emerald wreaths dipped into molten gold-overhanging under a\r\nleafy arcade, a rustic walk, which zigzags round the property, following\r\nto the southwest the many windings of the Belle Borne streamlet. This\r\nsylvan region most congenial to the tastes of a naturalist, echoes in\r\nspring and summer with the ever-varying and wild minstrelsy of the robin,\r\nthe veery, the songsparrow, the red-start, the hermit-thrush, the red-eyed\r\nflycatcher and other feathered choristers, while the golden-winged\r\nwoodpecker or rain fowl, heralds at dawn the coming rain of the morrow,\r\nand some crows, rendered saucy by protection, strut through the sprouting\r\ncorn, in their sable cassocks, like worldly clergymen computing their\r\ntythes. On the aforesaid walk, once trodden over by the prince of American\r\nnaturalists, the great Audubon, whilst on a visit to Mr. Atkinson at\r\nSpencer Wood, was conferred the name of _Audubon Avenue_, by his Sillery\r\ndisciple, the author of the _Birds of Canada. The grand river views of\r\nSpencer Wood, are replaced by a woodland scenery, sure to please the eye\r\nof any man of cultivated taste, accustomed to the park-like appearance of\r\nthe south of England. In front of the mansion, close to the lawn, stands\r\nthe noblest elm tree of Sillery (_Ulmus Americanus_), leafy to its very\r\nroots. Here, amidst literature and flowers, after leaving Spencer Wood,\r\nlived for several years Henry Atkinson, a name in those regions once\r\nsynonymous with ornamental gardens and flowers. Graperies, conservatories,\r\nan orchid house soon sprung up under his hand at this spot, larger than\r\nSpencer Wood had ever boasted of in its palmiest days, since 1860, it is\r\nthe seat of J. M. LeMoine.\r\n\r\n    The advent in Quebec of the great Audubon is heralded thus in the\r\n    Quebec _Gazette_ of the 23rd September, 1842:--\r\n\r\n    \"To the Editor of the Quebec _Gazette_\"\r\n\r\n    SIR,--It does not appear to be known to the Quebec public that one of\r\n    the most distinguished men of the present age is now on a visit to our\r\n    city--John James Audubon, the author of the magnificent work entitled\r\n    'Ornithological Biography; or an Account of the Habits of the Birds of\r\n    America, etc.' I understand that Mr. Audubon devoted nearly fifty\r\n    years of his life to this interesting subject, and has placed before\r\n    the world, at a cost of £27,000 sterling, the whole family of the\r\n    feathered tribe, giving to each its natural size, and coloured to the\r\n    very life. Mr. Audubon has brought one copy [232] of his work with\r\n    him, let as hope it may be secured by our citizens. It is his first\r\n    visit to Quebec, the splendid scenery of which has induced him to\r\n    prolong his stay a few days. His present portfolio contains several\r\n    beautiful specimens of the quadrupeds of America, now in course of\r\n    publication by him as a companion to the above splendid work, which\r\n    only requires to be seen to ensure him a numerous list of subscribers\r\n    in this neighborhood.\r\n\r\n    \"In order to afford Mr. Audubon every facility in the pursuit of his\r\n    arduous and interesting undertaking, the President of the United\r\n    States and the Commander-in-Chief, General Winfield Scott, have\r\n    furnished him the necessary documents to ensure him a cordial\r\n    reception throughout the Union.\r\n\r\n    \"Mr. Audubon thus speaks of his meeting on the coast of Labrador, a\r\n    British officer well known to us all in Quebec--\"But few days had\r\n    elapsed, when one morning we saw a vessel making towards our\r\n    anchorage, with the gallant flag of England waving in the breeze and\r\n    as she was moored within a cable's length of the _Ripley_, I soon\r\n    paid my respects to her commander, Captain Bayfield, of the Royal\r\n    Navy. The politeness of British naval officers is proverbial, and from\r\n    the truly frank and cordial reception of this gentleman and his brave\r\n    companions in arms, I felt more than ever assured of the truth of this\r\n    opinion.

M.\r\n    LEMOINE.\r\n\r\n    BY BENJAMIN SULTE, THE HISTORIAN OF \"THREE RIVERS.\"\r\n\r\n    [Translated from the French.]\r\n\r\n    One of the greatest attractions for me, says Mr. Sulte, in visiting\r\n    Spencer Grange, was its museum of Canadian birds, comprising two-\r\n    thirds of the Feathered tribe of the Dominion, with a fair sprinkling\r\n    of foreign specimens in the skin, and a collection of birds' eggs. Our\r\n    friend, long known among Canadian naturalists for his persevering\r\n    efforts during twenty years to popularize [233] the beautiful and\r\n    instructive study of ornithology, had evidently met with more than one\r\n    ally--in fact, many sympathizers. I am inclined to think--in his\r\n    special branch of natural history., Each class of birds, in this\r\n    apartment, has its corner; judging by the label, its \"habitation,\", as\r\n    well as name.\r\n\r\n    The thrushes and flycatchers of Canada, from their exquisite bright\r\n    tints or delicate arrow-shaped markings, are particularly conspicuous.\r\n\r\n    The cinnamon-backed cuckoo must be a graceful minstrel in our green\r\n    hedges in July, though I am ashamed to admit I never was lucky enough\r\n    to meet him. The oriole, blue jay, officer-bird, summer red-bird,\r\n    indigo-bird and golden-winged woodpecker form a group of striking\r\n    beauty; a most excellent idea, I would say, to thus place in\r\n    juxtaposition the most gorgeously habited of our feathered choristers\r\n    for the sake of contrasts.\r\n\r\n    A succession of drawers contain the nests and eggs, scientifically\r\n    labelled, of many Canadian species, and of some of the most melodious\r\n    songsters of France and England; pre-eminent stands the Italian,\r\n    French and Devonshire nightingale and its eggs. Our time was much too\r\n    limited to allow us to treasure up all the anecdotes and theories\r\n    anent birds, their mysterious spring and autumn migrations, their\r\n    lively memory of places, so agreeably dealt out to us. We cannot,\r\n    however, entirely omit noticing some curious objects we saw--the tiny\r\n    nest of a West Indian humming bird male out of a piece of sponge, and\r\n    he _cubiculum_ of a redheaded woodpecker, with its eggs still in\r\n    it, scooped out of the decayed heart of a silver birch tree, with the\r\n    bird's head still peering from the orifice in the bark. Here, as well\r\n    as in the library, the presentations were numerous: Col. Rhodes was\r\n    represented by a glossy Saguenay raven. I listened, expecting each\r\n    moment to hear it, like Poe's nocturnal visitor, \"ghostly, grim and\r\n    ancient,\" croak out \"nevermore!\"\r\n\r\n    The late Hon. Adam Fergusson Blair, once a familiar of Spencer Grange,\r\n    was remembered by some fine Scotch grouse, ptarmigan and a pair of\r\n    capercailzie, in splendid feather, brought from Scotland. A good\r\n    specimen of the silvery gull, shot at Niagara Falls, was a gift from\r\n    John William McCallum, Esq., now of Melbourne, E.T.--an early friend\r\n    of our friend, whilst a very rare foreign bird (a Florida or glossy\r\n    ibis), shot at Grondines, had been contributed by Paul J. Charlton,\r\n    Esq., a Quebec sportsman. What had brought it so far from home?\r\n\r\n    At the bead of the grave, omniscient owls, like the foreman of a grand\r\n    jury, stood a majestic \"grand duc,\" the largest owl of the Pyrénées,\r\n    resembling much our Virginian species,--a donation from a French\r\n    _savant_, Le Frère Ogérien. The owls have ever been to me a deep\r\n    subject of study, their defiant aspect, thoughtful countenances, in\r\n    which lurks a _soupçon_ of rapacity, remind me of a mayor and\r\n    town council bent on imposing new taxes without raising too much of a\r\n    row.\r\n\r\n    A gaudy and sleek bird of Paradise had been donated by Miss Caron, of\r\n    the adjoining _château_. There was also a newly-patented bird-\r\n    trap, sent by a New York firm, in the days of Boss Tweed, Conolly,\r\n    Field and other birds of prey I noticed boxes for sparrows to build\r\n    in, designed by Col W Rhodes. On the floor lay a curious sample of an\r\n    Old World man-trap, not sent from New York, but direct from England, a\r\n    terror to poachers and apple stealers, French swords and venomous\r\n    looking bayonets, of very ancient design, a rusty, long Indian musket\r\n    barrel together with _tibiae_ and _tarsi_, labelled 1759-60, presents\r\n    from H. J. Chouinard, Esq., the owner in 1865 of the site of the\r\n    battlefield at St. Foye, where stands _Le Monument des Braves_. A\r\n    bristling-fretful porcupine, a ferocious-looking lynx, and several\r\n    well-mounted specimens of game had been donated by McPherson Le Moyne,\r\n    Esq., the President of the \"Montreal Fish and Game Protection Club,\"\r\n    also several other contributions from the same.\r\n\r\n    Who had sent the colossal St. Bernard dog, like another Maida,\r\n    talking over the lawn, we had not an opportunity of asking. We patted\r\n    him, all trembling.\r\n\r\n    The flower garden is laid out in the modern landscape style. Fences\r\n    carefully concealed, a deep fringe of hard wood trees on one side, a\r\n    trim lilac hedge on the other, and a plantation of shrubs, roan,\r\n    barbary, sumac, lilac and young maple. On the side west of the house\r\n    was observable, next to a rustic seat, in the fork of a white birch,\r\n    an archaeological monument made with the key-stone of Prescott and\r\n    Palace Gates when removed by order of the City Corporation, [234] it\r\n    stands about ten feet in height.\r\n\r\n    From this spot, spanned by a little rustic bridge, a walk meanders\r\n    round the property to the west, canopied by a grove of silver birch,\r\n    oak, beach, pine and maple. Along the serpentine brook, Belle-Borne,\r\n    now so diminutive, and which, according to the historian Ferland, two\r\n    centuries ago turned the wheel of a mill below, is visible a dam,\r\n    creating a small pond in May, June and July, a favorite bathing place,\r\n    we are told, for the thrushes, robins and other songsters of the\r\n    adjoining groves. This tiny runlet is fringed with several varieties\r\n    of ferns, dog-tooth violets and other algae--(_From L'Opinion\r\n    Publique._)\r\n\r\n\r\n_SPENCER OR BAGATELLE COTTAGE._\r\n\r\n  \"We have many little Edens\r\n    Scattered up and down our dales;\r\n  We've a hundred pretty hamlets,\r\n    Nestling in our fruitful vales,\r\n  Here the sunlight loves to linger,\r\n    And the summer winds to blow,\r\n  Here the rosy spring in April,\r\n    Leapeth laughing from the snow.\"\r\n\r\nOn the western corner of the Spencer Grange property, and dependant to it,\r\ncan be seen from the road, _Bagatelle_--a long, straggling, picturesque\r\ncottage, in the Italian style, with trees, rustic seats, walks and a\r\nminiature flower-garden round it; a small prospect pavillion opens on the\r\nSt. Lewis road, furnishing a pretty view of the blue range of mountains to\r\nthe north; in summer it peeps from under clusters of the green or purple\r\nleaves of some luxuriant _Virginian_ creepers--our American ivy--which\r\nclimb round it. _Bagatelle was generally occupied by an _attaché_ of\r\nSpencer Wood, in the days of the Earl of Elgin and Sir Edmund W. Head.\r\n\r\nBagatelle is a quiet little nest, where our Canadian Laureate, Fréchette,\r\nmight be tempted to pen an invitation to his brother bard of the city,\r\nLeMay, somewhat in the manner of the soft warbler of Albion towards his\r\nfriend the Revd.

Sheppard,\r\nafterwards of Fairymead, Drummondville. For many years past it has become\r\nthe permanent residence of the Gibb family. The horticultural department\r\nand conservatory are under the immediate charge of Andrew Torrance, Esq.,\r\nMrs. Gibb's brother. His taste is too well known to require any praise,\r\nand truly may it be said that the lovers of sweet flowers, trim hedges,\r\nand fairy scenery, can easily beguile several hours together in exploring\r\nthe broad acres of Woodfield, equal in extent to Spencer Wood itself. In\r\nthe year 1646, the company of New France, under M. de Montmagny, conceded\r\nthis land, a lot of ground, with a frontage of three _arpents_, to\r\nJean Bouvart dit Lafortune. Jean Beauvart resold in 1649 to Barthélémy\r\nGaudin, in 1702 this land was possessed by Guillaume Pagé dit Garey. In\r\n1724, Nicholas de la Nouiller purchased it and sold it in 1731 to\r\nMonseigneur Dosquet, Bishop of Samos. In 1762, the seminary, then\r\nproprietor of these grounds, conceded to Thomas Ainsley, the portion on\r\nwhich stood the house, built by Bishop Dosquet. Judge Mabane acquired it\r\nin 1769, he died in 1792, when his sister Miss. Isabella Mabane purchased\r\nit in 1794 and held it until 1805, when the Honorable Matthew Bell\r\npurchased it.\r\n\r\nLet us hear on this subject one who knows how to describe and embellish a\r\ncountry seat.--\r\n\r\n\"In the early part of the last century,\" says the Honorable Wm. Sheppard,\r\n\"this estate was in the possession of Monseigneur Dosquet, [235] titular\r\nBishop of Samos _in partibus infidelum_, and he gave it that name\r\nafter his Episcopal title. He built a substantial stone residence near the\r\nbrow of the hill, overlooking the St. Lawrence--a one story house--with a\r\nhigh peaked roof, long and narrow, after the mode of building in those\r\ndays, something in the style of the manor house at Beauport. The name of\r\nSamos is now superseded by that of Woodfield, yet it is still in use as\r\napplied to the high road passing on its western side, commencing at the\r\ntermination of the road leading from Quebec in that direction, called the\r\nGrand Allée, where it forks into the Samos road and the Chemin Gomin at\r\nSpencer Wood. It is not known how long Bishop Dosquet occupied his estate.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after the cession of Canada to the British Crown, this property\r\npassed into the hands of Judge Mabane, [236] by purchase, from the\r\nreverend proprietors of the seigniory. Mr. Mabane changed the name to\r\nWoodfield, and made extensive alterations to the house, adding to it a\r\nsecond story, giving it by other additions a more imposing appearance from\r\nthe river, and adding two pavillion wings, connected with the house by\r\ncorridors. In 1775-6 it was converted into an hospital for American\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n\"About the year 1807, the late Honorable Matthew Bell purchased Woodfield\r\nfrom Miss Mabane, the Judge's sister. Mr. Bell occupied the house as a\r\nsummer dwelling only, and it is not known that he improved the estate to\r\nany extent, unless it were the garden, which he enlarged and stocked with\r\nchoice fruit trees. Previous to the purchase of Mr. Bell, Woodfield was\r\noccupied as a dwelling during several years (1795-1802) by Bishop\r\nMountain, the first Protestant Bishop of Quebec. During his occupation he\r\nremoved a bridge which spanned Bell Borne Brook, with the intention of\r\ncutting off communication with Powell Place (Spencer Wood), the\r\nneighboring estate, for reasons which it is not now necessary to enter\r\ninto. The bridge was subsequently restored, by the sons of Sir R. S.\r\nMilnes, Governor General, and was known by the name of Pont Bonvoisin.\r\n\r\n\"In 1816 Woodfield passed into the possession of Mr. William Sheppard, by\r\npurchase, from Mr. Bell. Mr. Sheppard improved the house and grounds\r\ngreatly, erecting vineries and a large conservatory, changing the front of\r\nthe house so as to look upon a rising lawn of good extent, interspersed\r\nwith venerable oaks and pine, giving the whole a striking and pleasing\r\naspect. The alteration in the house gave it a very picturesque appearance,\r\nas viewed from the foot of the old avenue, backed by sombre pines Mr.\r\nSheppard added to the estate about sixty acres of land on its southern\r\nside, it being now bounded by the road leading to St. Michael's Cove.\r\nDuring the alterations made in the house, a leaden foundation plate was\r\ndiscovered, stating that the house was built in 1732, by Bishop Dosquet.\r\nThis plate was deposited for safe keeping in the Museum of the Literary\r\nand Historical Society, where (if still extant) it may be consulted.\r\n\r\n\"In December 1842, the house was unfortunately destroyed by fire, and with\r\nit a valuable library of some three thousand volumes, many of them costly\r\nillustrated works on Natural History and other sciences. Shortly\r\nafterwards a new house was built on a more desirable and commanding site,\r\nin the midst of splendid old oaks and pines, looking down upon an\r\nextensive lawn, with the St Lawrence in the middle distance, the view\r\nterminated by the South Shore, studded with cheerful-looking cottages. To\r\nsuit the new site Mr. Sheppard laid out a new approach, placing the\r\nentrance somewhat nearer Quebec, than the old avenue, following the\r\nroundings of Belle Borne Brook, and leaving it with a striking sweep,\r\namong groups of trees, to the house. This approach is one of the greatest\r\nattractions of the place. He also built a large conservatory in connection\r\nwith the house.\r\n\r\n\"Woodfield changed hands in 1847, having been purchased by Thos. Gibb,\r\nEsq., who exchanged it with his brother, Jas. Gibb, Esq., a wealthy\r\nmerchant of Quebec, president of the Quebec Bank, who added much to the\r\nbeauty of the estate. [237] Woodfield, with the improvements and\r\nembellishments made by the preceding proprietor is one of the most\r\nimposing and showy places in Canada, well worthy the encomiums passed upon\r\nit by J. Jay Smith, Esq., of Philadelphia, editor of the\r\n_Horticulturist_, who, with a party of friends, visited it in 1857.\r\nHe says, in that work, 'James Gibb, Esq., at Woodfield, possesses one of\r\nthe most charming places on the American continent.  Thoroughly English in\r\nits appurtenances, and leaving out its views of the St. Lawrence, its\r\nlawns, trees, and superb garden are together, a model of what may be\r\naccomplished. The whole scene was enchanting. The traveller felt as if he\r\nwas transported to the best parts of England, our whole party uniting in\r\nan exclamation of pleasure and gratification. Here is everything in the\r\nway of well-kept lawns, graperies and greenhouses, outhouses for every\r\npossible contingency of weather, gardens, redolent of the finest flowers,\r\nin which bulbs of the best lilies make a conspicuous figure, and every\r\nspecies of fruit that can be grown. The traveller who does not see\r\nWoodfield hah not seen Canada in its best trim.'\r\n\r\n\"The remains of one redoubt [238] are visible near Belle Borne Brook, just\r\nabove Pont Bonvoisin, or Bridge of Friendship, no doubt intended to guard\r\nthe approach to Quebec by the footpath from Pointe à Puiseaux. Another\r\nlarge one was on the west side of Samos road, nearly opposite the entrance\r\ngate of the new approach to Woodfield, it commanded the Samos road.\r\n\r\n\"Woodfield once could boast of a well-stocked aviary. The garden, of large\r\nextent, has always been celebrated for its fruit and flowers, for the\r\ntaste in which it was laid out, and for the beautiful prospect obtained\r\nfrom it of the Citadel of Quebec, of the intervening portion of the St.\r\nLawrence, with the numerous shipping in the harbour busily engaged in\r\ntaking in their return cargoes of the staple article of exportation.\"\r\n\r\nSince this sketch was published in the _Maple Leaves_ for 1865, death\r\nhas borne heavily on the estimable Gibb family we then knew at Woodfield;\r\nand in 1879, Mr. John Lawson Gibb sold the old homestead as a site for an\r\nornate rural cemetery.\r\n\r\n    \"WOODFIELD CONSERVATORY--On 10th Feby, 1869 we availed ourselves of\r\n    the opportunity afforded to the public of visiting this celebrated\r\n    conservatory, and feasting our eyes on the immense mass of floral\r\n    treasures which it contains. Flora's rarest gifts from every quarter\r\n    of the globe are here in full bloom. The Indian Azaleas are\r\n    magnificent beyond description--the one near the entrance called\r\n    'Criterion\" is exquisitely beautiful, Roi Leopold, purpurea and alba\r\n    are also very handsome.

St. Michael's\r\nChurch was weekly honoured by the attendance of the Sovereign's\r\nrepresentative and _suite_ when inhabiting Spencer Wood; and on fine\r\nsummer days by the rank and fashion of the neighbouring metropolis. It is\r\na handsome cut-stone church, in the Gothic style. The incumbent for many\r\nyears has been the Rev. Anthony A.

It is thirty two acres in extent, and the grounds were\r\ntastefully laid out by the late Major Douglas, U. S. Engineers, whose\r\ntaste and skill had been previously shown in the design of Greenwood\r\nCemetery, near New York. A carriage drive, upwards of two miles in extent,\r\naffords access to all parts of the grounds, and has been so arranged as to\r\nafford the most perfect view of the scenery. The visitor, after driving\r\nover the smooth lawn-like open surface, finds himself suddenly transferred\r\nby a turn of the road into a dark avenue of stately forest trees, from\r\nwhich he emerges to see the broad St. Lawrence almost beneath him, with\r\nthe city of Quebec and the beautiful slopes of Point Levi in the distance.\r\n\r\nMany beautiful monuments now adorn the grounds, some of which are from\r\nMontreal and some from Scotland; but the great majority are the\r\nproductions of Mr. Felix Morgan, of Quebec, and do credit to his taste and\r\nskill. Many of them are beautiful and costly structures of Italian marble.\r\nThe Aberdeen and Peterhead granite is much used at present for monuments\r\nto the departed.\r\n\r\nA neat gothic lodge at the entrance of the grounds contains the office and\r\nresidence of the superintendent. In the former, a complete plan of the\r\ngrounds is kept, every separate grave being marked upon it with its\r\nappropriate number, so that at any future time, on consulting it, the\r\nexact spot of interment can be ascertained, and the Register which is also\r\nkept, affords information respecting the places of birth, age, and date of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThere are few sites round Quebec more attractive to visit, especially\r\nduring the month of September, than the last abode of the departed,\r\ncrowning the green banks of the St. Lawrence at Sillery--the Cemetery of\r\nMount Hermon. Apart from possessing some of the most picturesque scenery\r\nin America, this spot borrows from the glories of autumn tints of a fairy\r\nbrightness. In providing for the repose of the dead, the citizens of all\r\ndenominations seemed to have vied to surpass one another. Scarcely had the\r\nskilful designer, Major Douglas, U.S.E., completed the laying out of the\r\nMount Hermon grounds, when a strong desire was manifested in all quarters\r\nto do away with _intra mural_ burials. In a very short time, the\r\nRoman Catholics had selected as a cemetery the lovely old seat of the late\r\nMr. Justice P. Panet, on the banks of the St. Charles, whilst a few years\r\nlater the shady groves of Belmont, on the Ste. Foye road, were required\r\nfor a similar object. The ornamentation of a _necropolis_ must naturally\r\nbe a work of time, trees do not spring up in one summer, nor do lawns\r\nclothe themselves with a soft, green velvety surface in one season, and if\r\nthe flowers in Mount Hermon are so beautiful and so well attended to, the\r\nsecret in a measure possibly rests with the landscape gardener located at\r\nthe entrance, and who professes to furnish flowers for the adornment of\r\ncemetery lots, and to plant and keep them fresh during the summer. The St.\r\nCharles, St. Patrick and Belmont Cemeteries, which do not enjoy in the\r\nsame measure these facilities, cannot be expected to possess all the\r\nrustic adornments of their elder brother. One may safely predict that ere\r\nmany summers go by, our public cemeteries, by their natural beauty, are\r\nlikely to attract crowds of strangers, as Greenwood and Mount Auburn do in\r\nthe States. Chaste monumental marbles, on which can be detected the chisel\r\nof English, Scotch and Canadian artists, are at present noticeable all\r\nover the grounds, tastefully laid out and smiling _parterres_ of annuals\r\nand perennials throw a grateful fragrance over the tomb where sleeps\r\nmayhap a beloved parent, a kind sister, an affectionate brother, a true\r\nfriend, a faithful lover. How forcibly all this was brought to our minds\r\nrecently on strolling through the shady walks of Mount Hermon. Under the\r\numbrageous trees, perfumed by roses and lilies, tombs, [239] silent,\r\ninnumerable tombs on all sides, on marble, the names of friends, kindred,\r\nacquaintances, solemn stillness all round us, at our feet the placid\r\ncourse of our majestic flood. There were indeed many friends round us,\r\nthough invisible, nay, on counting over the slumberers, we found we had\r\nmore, though not dearer friends, in this abode of peace than within the\r\nwalls of yonder city. Overpowered by mournful, though soothing thoughts,\r\nwe walked along pondering over those truthful reflections of Washington\r\nIrving:--\r\n\r\n    \"There is a voice from the tomb sweeter than song, there is a\r\n    recollection of the dead to which we turn ever from the charms of the\r\n    living Oh, the grave! the grave! It buries every error, covers every\r\n    defect, extinguishes every resentment. From its peaceful bosom spring\r\n    none but fond regrets and tender recollections. * * * The grave of\r\n    those we loved--what a place for meditation. There it is that we call\r\n    up in long review the whole history of virtue and gentleness, and the\r\n    thousand endearments lavished upon us almost unheeded in the daily\r\n    intercourse of intimacy; there it is that we dwell upon the\r\n    tenderness, the solemn, awful tenderness of the parting scene; the bed\r\n    of death with all its stifled grief; its noiseless attendants; its\r\n    mute, watchful assiduities; the last testimonies of expiring love; the\r\n    feeble, faltering, thrilling (oh, how thrilling!) pressure of the\r\n    hand; the last fond look of the glazing eye, turning upon us from the\r\n    threshold of existence; the faint, faltering accents struggling in\r\n    death to give once more assurance of affection! aye, go to the grave\r\n    of buried love and meditate! There settle the account with thy\r\n    conscience for every past benefit unrequited, every past endearment\r\n    unregarded of that being who can never, never, never return to be\r\n    soothed by thy contrition. If thou art a child and hast ever added a\r\n    sorrow to the soul, or a furrow to the silvered brow of an\r\n    affectionate parent; if thou art a husband and hast ever caused the\r\n    fond bosom that ventured its whole happiness in thy arms to doubt one\r\n    moment of thy kindness or thy truth; if thou art a friend and hast\r\n    ever wronged in thought, word or deed the spirit that generously\r\n    confided in thee; if thou art a lover and hast ever given one\r\n    unmerited pang to that true heart that now lies cold and still beneath\r\n    thy feet, then be sure that every unkind look, every ungracious word,\r\n    every ungentle action will come thronging back upon thy memory and\r\n    knocking dolefully at thy soul....\r\n\r\n    Then weave that chaplet of flowers and strew the beauties of nature\r\n    about the grave; console thy broken spirit if thou canst with these\r\n    tender, though futile, tributes of regret; but take warning over the\r\n    dead, and be more faithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy\r\n    duties to the living.\" Reader, allow not pensive September to close in\r\n    without visiting Mount Hermon, linger under its silent shades, go\r\n    partake of the joy of grief, and meditate at the grave of a buried\r\n    love.\r\n\r\n    \"MONUMENT TO LIEUT. BAINES, R.A.--Few of our readers but recollect and\r\n    cherish the name of Lieut. Baines, who unfortunately lost his life\r\n    while gallantly endeavoring to arrest the progress of the\r\n    conflagration which destroyed the greater portion of St. Roch's\r\n    suburbs in October, 1866. His gallant devotion to duty, and his zeal\r\n    in one of the most praiseworthy and charitable objects that ever\r\n    engaged the attention of man, has caused his memory to be cherished\r\n    with love and respect by every one of our citizens. Last year the\r\n    ladies of the General Hospital sent a tribute of their gratitude to\r\n    his widowed mother in England, worked by their own hands. Now the\r\n    citizens of Quebec have completed their share of the grateful task. We\r\n    had the mournful pleasure yesterday of viewing one of the most chaste\r\n    and graceful monuments that adorn Mount Hermon Cemetery, erected by\r\n    public subscription, and placed over the grave of one whose memory is\r\n    so dearly cherished by all. The monument is of the Egyptian style of\r\n    architecture, an obelisk 18 feet in height, with a base of 4 feet 10\r\n    inches, designed and modelled by our talented fellow-citizen, Mr. F.\r\n    Morgan, sculptor, St. John street, so many of whose classic memorials\r\n    of the dead grace Mount Hermon. It is cut from a solid block of\r\n    imported sandstone, and in chasteness of design or execution is not\r\n    excelled on this continent. It bears the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n                   Erected by the citizens of Quebec\r\n                       To preserve the memory\r\n                and to record their gratitude for the\r\n                        gallant services of\r\n                     Lieut. Henry Edmund Baines,\r\n                           Royal Artillery,\r\n               whose death was occasioned by his noble\r\n                   efforts to arrest the progress\r\n                      of the calamitous fire\r\n                   which, on the 14th Oct., 1866\r\n               destroyed a large portion of the city.\r\n             Born at Shrewsbury, England, April 4, 1840\r\n                    Died at Quebec Oct. 27, 1866\r\n\r\n    Surmounting the epitaph is the coat of arms of the Royal Artillery,\r\n    chiselled out of the solid block by the hands of a finished artist,\r\n    with the motto of the regiment in a scroll underneath--\"_Quo fas et\r\n    gloria ducunt_' The erection of this, monument to the memory of the\r\n    brave but unfortunate young officer is a noble tribute of gratitude on\r\n    the part of our citizens, and in entrusting its execution to our\r\n    talented fellow-townsman, Mr. Morgan, the committee has shown a wise,\r\n    discretion that makes the completion of their task one upon which they\r\n    may heartily congratulate themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nA VOICE FROM MOUNT HERMON\r\n\r\n  DEDICATED TO MRS.

'Tis pleasant, after December's\r\nmurky nights, or January and February's inexorable chills, to go and bask\r\non the sunny banks of our great river, under the shade of trees, in the\r\nbalmy spring, and amidst the gifts of a bountiful nature, to inhale\r\nfragrance and health and joy. Pleasant, also, to wander during September\r\nin our solemn woods, \"with footsteps inaudible on the soft yellow floor,\r\ncomposed of the autumnal sheddings of countless years.\" Yes, soothing to\r\nus are these memories of home--of home amusements, home pleasures, and\r\neven of home sorrows. Sweeter still, even though tinged with melancholy,\r\nthe remembrance of the departed friends,--those guardian spirits we once\r\nsaw moving in some of our Canadian homes in the legitimate pride of\r\nhospitality--surrounded by young and loving hearts--enshrined in the\r\nrespect of their fellow men.\r\n\r\nOft has it been our privilege at that festive season of our year, when a\r\nhallowed custom brings Canada's sons and daughters together with words of\r\ngreeting and good-fellowship, to wend our way to Bardfield, high on the\r\nbreezy hills of Sillery, and exchange a cordial welcome with the venerable\r\nman who had dwelt in our midst for many long years. Seldom has it been our\r\nlot to approach one who, as a scholar, a gentleman, a prelate, or what is\r\nmore than all those titles put together, a truly good man, impressed\r\nhimself more agreeably on our mind.\r\n\r\nAnother revolution of the circling year and the good pastor, the courteous\r\ngentleman, the learned divine, our literary [240] friend and neighbour,\r\nthe master of Bardfield, had been snatched from among us and from an\r\nadmiring public.  Where is the Quebecer who has not noticed the neat\r\ncottage on the north of the St. Lewis road, where lived and died the Lord\r\nBishop Mountain? As you pass, you see as formerly its lovely river view,\r\ngravelled walks, curving avenue, and turfy lawns, luxuriant hedges\r\ndesigned by a hand now cold in death. Bardfield continues to be occupied\r\nby Miss Mountain and other members of the late Bishop's family. A school\r\nhouse, in the rural Gothic style, quite an ornament to Sillery, has been\r\nerected by His Lordship's family, as a memorial of the sojourn at this\r\nspot of this true friend of suffering humanity and patron of education.\r\n\r\nBardfield, founded about forty years ago by an eminent merchant of Quebec,\r\nPeter Burnet, Esquire, was recently purchased by Albert Furness, Esquire\r\nand by him leased to Charles Earnest Levey, Esquire, until Kirke Ella, the\r\nproperty of Mr. Levy, is rebuilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE FAMILY OF MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\n    The family of Mountain, which is a very old Norman family, and\r\n    therefore of French extraction, originally wrote their name \"de\r\n    Montaigne,\" from the name of their estates at Périgord, near Bordeaux,\r\n    and as stated in the life of one of its members, the well-known\r\n    Michael Seigneur de Montaigne, the essayist and philosopher, \"This\r\n    race was noble, but noble without any great lustre till his time,\r\n    which fortune showed him signal favours, and, together with honorary\r\n    and titular distinctions, procured for him the collar of the Order of\r\n    St. Michael, which at that time was the utmost mark of honour of the\r\n    French _noblesse_, and very rare. He was twice elected mayor of\r\n    Bordeaux, his father, a man of great honour and equity, having\r\n    formerly also had the same dignity.\"\r\n\r\n    Michael left only a daughter--Leonor or Leonora, who by marrying a\r\n    distant cousin of the same name, preserved the estates in the family,\r\n    as they had been for more than a century before they were inherited by\r\n    her father. These remained in possession of the senior branch until\r\n    the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, when, having espoused the\r\n    Protestant cause, they were forced to sacrifice them and quit the\r\n    country in 1685, with what ready money they could hastily get\r\n    together. With this they purchased an estate in Norwich, England; from\r\n    which in after generations several of the family went out to Canada,\r\n    and among them the late Bishop of Quebec.\r\n\r\n    To him, likewise I have heard attributed the irreverent piece of wit\r\n    alluded to by the _Witness_; but with equal injustice, as his son, the\r\n    late Bishop of Quebec assured me. [241]\r\n\r\n    It is one of those sayings evidently made up for people whose names or\r\n    position suit for hanging them on.\r\n\r\n    George Mountain, D.D., Archbishop of York, was a contemporary of\r\n    Michael de Montaigne, and a scion of the same family, though through a\r\n    younger branch, which appears to have crossed over from France about\r\n    the time of the massacre of St. Bartholomew in the reign of Queen\r\n    Elizabeth, and for the same reason that the elder branch did\r\n    afterwards, namely, because of their religious tenets.\r\n\r\n    It is not by any means improbable that by this separation from the\r\n    rest of his family, who were still adherents of the Roman Catholic\r\n    faith, and the consequent abandonment of worldly prospects for the\r\n    sake of religious principles, the Archbishop's progenitors may have\r\n    been reduced in circumstances, but only comparatively with what he had\r\n    lost before, for history shows that the Archbishop himself was, born\r\n    at Callwood Castle, educated at Queen's College, Cambridge, chosen a\r\n    Fellow in 1591, and Junior Proctor of that University in 1600, Dean of\r\n    Westminster in 1610, Bishop of Lincoln in 1617, Bishop of London in\r\n    1621, Bishop of Durham in 1627, and Archbishop of York in 1628.\r\n\r\n      JACOB J. C. MOUNTAIN,\r\n\r\n      Formerly of Coteau de Lac, Canada, now Vicar of Bulford, England.\r\n      BULFORD VICARAGE, Amesbury, Salisbury, May 30, 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENMORE.\r\n\r\nWe like to portray to ourselves our energetic neighbour of Benmore House,\r\nsuch as we can recall him in his palmy, sporting days of 1865; we shall\r\nquote from the _Maple Leaves_ of that year:\r\n\r\n\"It will not be one of the least glories of 'Our Parish,' even when the\r\nProvince will have expanded into an empire, with Sillery as the seat of\r\nVice Royalty, to be able to boast of possessing the Canadian, the adopted\r\nhome of a British officer of wealth and intelligence, known to the\r\nsporting world as the Great Northern Hunter. Who had not heard of the\r\n_battues_ of Col. Rhodes on the snow-clad peaks of Cap Tourment, on\r\nthe Western Prairies, and all along the Laurentian chain of mountains? One\r\nman alone through the boundless territory extending from Quebec to the\r\nNorth Pole, can dispute the belt with the Sillery Nimrod, but then, a\r\nmighty hunter is he; by name in the St. Joachim settlement, Olivier\r\nCauchon, to Canadian sportsmen known as _Le Roi des Bois_. It is said, but\r\nwe cannot vouch for the fact--that Cauchon, in order to acquire the scent,\r\nswiftness and sagacity of the cariboo, has lived on cariboo milk, with an\r\ninfusion of moss and bark, ever since his babyhood, but that this very\r\nwinter (1865) he killed, with slugs, four cariboo at one shot, we can\r\nvouch for.\r\n\r\nA few weeks since, a _habitant_ with a loaded sleigh passed our gate;\r\non the top of his load was visible a noble pair of antlers. \"Qui a tué--\r\nces cariboo?\" we asked. Honest John Baptiste replied, \"Le Colonel Rhodes,\r\nMonsieur.\" Then followed a second--then a third. Same question asked, to\r\nwhich for reply--\"Le Colonel Rhodes, Monsieur.\" Then another sleigh load\r\nof cariboo, in all twelve Cariboo, two sleighs of hare, grouse and\r\nptarmigan, then a man carrying a dead _carcajou_, then in the distance,\r\nthe soldier-like phiz of the Nimrod himself, nimbly following on foot the\r\ncavalcade. This was too much, we stopped and threatened the Colonel to\r\napply to Parliament for an Act to protect the game of Canada against his\r\nunerring rifle. Were we not fully aware of the gratifying fact, that,\r\nunder recent legislative enactment, the fish and game of Canada have much\r\nincreased, we might be inclined to fancy that the Colonel will never rest\r\nuntil he has bagged the last moose, the last cariboo in the country.\r\n\r\nBenmore nestles cosily in a pine grove on the banks of the great river,\r\nthe type of an English Country gentleman's homestead. In front of the\r\nhouse, a spacious piazza, from which you can watch the river craft; in the\r\nvast surrounding meadows, a goodly array of fat Durhams and Ayrshires, in\r\nthe farm-yard, short-legged Berkshires squeaking merrily in the distance,\r\nrosy-cheeked English boys romping on the lawn, surrounded by pointers and\r\nsetters: such, the grateful sights which, greeted our eyes one lovely June\r\nmorning round Benmore House, the residence of the President of the Quebec\r\nGame Club, and late member of Parliament for Megantic.\" (Written in 1865.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTATION OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\nSixteen years have elapsed since these lines were penned, and the Colonel\r\nhas devoted much time, spent a large amount of capital on his vegetable\r\nfarm and his green houses. Agriculturalists and naturalists will know him\r\nas the introducer of the English sparrow and the Messina quail.\r\n\r\n    _THE SPARROW AND QUAIL._\r\n\r\n    Information for Mr. Lemoine on the importation of the European house\r\n    sparrow and on that of the migratory quail. In consequence of great\r\n    complaints all over the United States of the ravages of insects and\r\n    particularly of caterpillars, amongst street and park trees and their\r\n    visible destruction, it was generally recommended to girdle the trees\r\n    with tin troughs containing oil or some liquid, also to pick the\r\n    insects off the infected trees. This course had been followed to a\r\n    very considerable extent, when it struck me the importation of the\r\n    common house sparrow would meet the difficulty. In 1854 I imported\r\n    sparrows. I turned loose six birds at Portland, Maine, and brought\r\n    about as many more to Quebec.\r\n\r\n    On turning the birds loose at Portland, I wrote a letter to the\r\n    _Portland Advertiser_, recommending the English sparrow as an\r\n    insect destroyer, especially in the early spring months when the\r\n    native birds are away on their migrations. This idea of picking off\r\n    insects with birds commended itself to the municipal authorities of\r\n    Boston and other large cities, who made large importations of\r\n    sparrows, with the result of saving their ornamental trees from\r\n    destruction.\r\n\r\n    The first colony of sparrows failed at Quebec. I therefore made two\r\n    more importations, succeeding at last by wintering over thirteen birds\r\n    --This occurred about ten years ago, there are now house sparrows all\r\n    over Canada, our French Canadians say \"_C'est un oiseau qui suit la\r\n    Religion_\" frequenting churches, convents and sacred places, and it\r\n    is considered a privilege to have so good a bird about the house. The\r\n    sparrow lives readily in Canada, as it feeds on the droppings of the\r\n    horse and takes shelter down the chimneys or under the roofs of the\r\n    houses. The enemies of the sparrow are very numerous, notably the\r\n    great Northern Shrike, the owls, hawks and in summer the swifts and\r\n    swallows. I have seen the English sparrow from New York to St.\r\n    Francisco, and from the Saguenay to Florida. In some places the bird\r\n    is used as an article of food, and there is no doubt this will be the\r\n    case generally; it will also become an object of sport for young\r\n    shooters and trappers in America, the same as it has always been in\r\n    Europe.\r\n\r\n    THE QUAIL.\r\n\r\n    I imported this bird in 1880, turning loose over 100 birds between\r\n    Quebec and the river Saguenay, I cannot say what has been the result;\r\n    the French population have taken much interest in this importation,\r\n    because they understand it is a bird well known in France as La\r\n    Caille, and I have no doubt it will become quite numerous in our\r\n    French settlements wherever it is established.\r\n\r\n    Large numbers of migratory quail have been imported for the State of\r\n    Maine, 2,500 birds were turned loose in 1880, in all about 10,000\r\n    quails have been imported for the United States and Canada during the\r\n    last few years, and as no importations are being made this year we\r\n    shall see what the migratory instinct does for the North in the spring\r\n    of the year?\r\n\r\n    It is very certain the migratory quail leave for parts unknown at an\r\n    early period in the autumn, but where they go to and whether they\r\n    return to the north has not been established; whilst they are with us,\r\n    they are very friendly, frequently mixing with the chickens in the\r\n    back yards. It is not improbable the feeling which gives hospitality\r\n    to the house sparrow will extend itself to the Farmer's Quail, and\r\n    that the latter bird may receive the same treatment from the settler\r\n    as he gives to ordinary domestic fowl, such as Pigeons, Guinea fowl,\r\n    and so on.--_W. Rhodes_.\r\n\r\n    BENMORE, 4th February, 1881.\r\n\r\n    N.B.--The house sparrow has indeed multiplied amazingly and though an\r\n    emigrant and not \"un enfant du sol\" has found a hearty welcome. 'Tis\r\n    said that he scares away our singing birds, if he should thus\r\n    interfere with the freedom of action of the _natives_, he will get the\r\n    cold shoulder, even though he should be an _emigrant_.\r\n\r\n    The sparrow though a long suffering bird is neither meek nor\r\n    uncomplaining. A \"limb of the law\" is, we are told, responsible for\r\n    the following:\r\n\r\n      _A HUMBLE APPEAL._\r\n\r\n     (_To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle_.)\r\n\r\n      DEAR SIR,--Oft, doubtless, passing through the Ring,\r\n      Me you have seen in autumn, summer, spring--\r\n      Picking, with gleesome chirp, and nimble feet,\r\n      My scanty living from the public street;\r\n      Or else devouring in those golden hours,\r\n      Insects from cabbages and other flowers:--\r\n      Ah me! those happy days!--but they are past,\r\n      And winter with his harsh and biting blast\r\n      Remind me and my fellow-sparrows bold\r\n      Of coming snow-storms, ice and sleet and cold;\r\n      Reminds us, too, of those far-off abodes,\r\n      Whence we were rudely reft by Col. R----s,\r\n      On his acclimatizing purpose bent,\r\n      And moved by scientific sentiment,\r\n      My heart is anxious, Sir, from what I know\r\n      Of last years sufferings from cold and snow,\r\n      Another winter's hardships, will, I fear,\r\n      Cause us poor colonists to disappear.\r\n      What shall we do, Dear Sir?--how shall we live,\r\n      Unless our charitable townsmen give\r\n      Us aid in food and shelter, otherwise\r\n      Each of us young and old, and male and female, dies!\r\n      Could we not make our _friend_ our _Garnishee_,\r\n      And seize his chattels by a _tiers saisi_?\r\n      (I tell him, Sir, that living mid the frosts\r\n      Is harder far than paying _lawyers' costs_)\r\n      Or do you think, (I write in great anxiety,)\r\n      We have a claim on the St. George Society?\r\n      We are compatriots--an exiled band,\r\n      From the fair pickings of our native land,\r\n      Cast on this frigid shore by savage Fate,\r\n      With mouths to fill, and bills to liquidate.\r\n      Dear Sir, I leave our case now with you, pray\r\n      To make it public do not long delay,\r\n      But give it, (I don't mean to be ironical,)\r\n      A prominent position in the CHRONICLE.\r\n      My wife and children cry to me for corn\r\n      With feeble earnestness and chirp forlorn,\r\n      My eye is dim, my heart within me pines,\r\n      My claws so numb I scarce can scratch two lines,\r\n      My head--no more will I your feelings harrow,\r\n      But sign me,\r\n              Truly yours,\r\n                         Till death,\r\n      All Souls' Day.                   COCKSPARROW.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CLAREMONT._\r\n\r\nTHE SEAT OF THOMAS BECKETT, ESQUIRE.\r\n\r\n  \"A house amid the quiet country's shades,\r\n  With length'ning vistas, ever sunny glades,\r\n  Beauty and fragrance clustering o'er the wall.\r\n  A porch inviting, and an ample hall.\"\r\n\r\nClaremont was founded by Lieut.-Governor R. E. Caron, and was his family\r\nmansion--ever since he left Spencer Grange which he had temporally\r\nleased,--until he was named Lt.-Governor of the Province of Quebec. We\r\nfind in it, combined the taste and comfort which presides in Canadian\r\nhomes; and in the fortunes of its founder, an illustration of the fact,\r\nthat under the sway of Britain, the road to the highest honours has ever\r\nbeen open to colonists, irrespective of creed or nationality.\r\n\r\nClaremont stands about one acre from the main road, three miles from\r\nQuebec, a handsome, comfortable and substantial villa. The umbrageous\r\ngrove of trees which encloses it from view, is a plantation laid down by\r\nthe late occupant about twenty-five years ago; its growth has been truly\r\nwonderful. The view from the veranda and rear of the house is magnificent\r\nin the extreme. To the west of the dwelling, environed in forest trees\r\nwell protected against our northern \"blizzards,\" lies the fruit, flower\r\nand vegetable garden, laid out originally by Madame Caron; watered by an\r\nunfailing spring, its dark rich soil produces most luxuriant vegetables,\r\nand Mr. Beckett's phlox, lilies, pansies, roses, generally stand well\r\nrepresented on the prize list of the Quebec Horticultural Society, of\r\nwhich Mr. Beckett is a most active member.\r\n\r\nClaremont [242] is indicated by one of the most reliable of our\r\nhistorians, the Abbé Ferland, as the spot where one of the first Sillery\r\nmissionaries, Frère Liégeois met with his end at the hands of some hostile\r\nIndians. This occurred in the spring of 1655. The missionary at the time\r\nwas helping the colonists to build a small redoubt to protect their maize\r\nand wheat fields from the inroads of their enemies. On viewing, at\r\nSillery, in 1881, Claremont the luxurious country seat of a successful\r\nmerchant, memory reverts to the same locality two centuries back, when\r\nevery tree of the locality might have concealed a ferocious _Iroquois_\r\nbent on his errand of death.\r\n\r\nFrom the cupola of Claremont, a wondrous vista is revealed. The eye gazing\r\nnorthward, rests on the nodding pinnacles of the spruce, hemlock and\r\nsurrounding pine. Towards the south-east and west you have before you\r\nnearly every object calculated to add effect to the landscape. Far below\r\nat your feet, rushes on the mighty St. Lawrence, with its fleet of\r\nmerchantmen and rafts of timber; the church of St. Romuald, half way up\r\nthe hill; facing you, the Etchemin stream, its mills, its piers, crowded\r\nwith deals; to the west, the roaring Chaudière, \"La Rivière Bruyante\" of\r\nearly times, in the remote distance, on a bright morning, are also plainly\r\nvisible, the hills of the White Mountains of Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE WILD FLOWERS OF SILLERY._\r\n\r\n  \"Everywhere about us are they glowing,\r\n    Some like stars, to tell us spring is born;\r\n  Others, their blue eyes, with tears o'erflowing,\r\n    Stand like Ruth amid the golden corn.\"\r\n\r\nAre you an admirer of nature, and sweet flowers? Would you, most worthy\r\nfriend, like to see some of the bright gems which spring, whilst dallying\r\nover the sequestered, airy heights and swampy marshes of our woods drops\r\nalong our path? Follow, then, sketch book and pencil in hand, the fairy\r\nfootsteps of one of the most amiable women which old England ever sent to\r\nour climes, accompany the Countess of Dalhousie on a botanizing tour\r\nthrough Sillery woods; you have her note book, if not herself, to go by.\r\nFor May, see what an ample store of bright flowers scattered around you;\r\nfear not to lose yourself in thickets and underbrush; far from the beaten\r\ntrack a noble lady has ransacked the environs over and over again,\r\nsometimes alone, sometimes with an equally enthusiastic and intelligent\r\nfriend, who hailed from Woodfield; [243] sweet flowers and beautiful ferns\r\nattract other noble ladies to this day in that wood. Are you anxious to\r\npossess the first-born of spring? Whilst virgin snow still whitens the\r\nfields, send a young friend to pluck for you, from the willow, its golden\r\ncatkins:--\r\n\r\n      \"The first gilt thing\r\n  Decked with the earliest pearls of spring.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gomin Wood will, with the dawn of May, afford you materials for a\r\nwreath, rich in perfume and wild in beauty. The quantity of wild flowers,\r\nto be found in the environs of Quebec has called forth the following\r\nremarks from one of Flora's most fervid votaries, a gentleman well known\r\nin this locality:--\"A stranger,\" says he, \"landing in this country, is\r\nmuch surprised to find the flowers which he has carefully cultivated in\r\nhis garden at home, growing wild at his feet. Such as dog-tooth violets,\r\ntrilliums and columbines. I was much excited when I discovered them for\r\nthe first time; the _trillium_, for which I had paid three shillings\r\nand six-pence when in England, positively growing wild. I could scarcely\r\nbelieve that I had a right to gather them; having paid so much for one, I\r\nfelt that it was property, valuable property running wild, and no one\r\ncaring to gather it. No one? Yes! some did, for _we_ carried all that\r\nwe could find, and if the reader will stroll along the hedges on St. Lewis\r\nroad he will find them in abundance: dark purple flowers, growing on a\r\nstalk naked to near the summit, where there is a whorl of three leaves,\r\nits sepals are three, petals three, stamens twice three, and its stigmas\r\nthree, hence its name of _trillium_. We have a few of the white varieties.\r\nAfter the purple _trillium_ has done flowering, we have the painted\r\ntrillium of the woods; the _trillium grandiflorum_ is abundant at Grosse\r\nIsle. The dog-tooth violet early arrested my attention; the spotted leaves\r\nand the bright yellow flowers, fully recurved in the bright sunshine,\r\ncontrasted beautifully with the fresh green grass on the banks on which\r\nthey are usually found, the bulbs are deep-seated, and the plant will at\r\nonce, from the general appearance of the flower, be recognized as\r\nbelonging to the lily family.\r\n\r\n\"The marsh marigolds, with the bright yellow buttercup-looking flowers,\r\nare now in full luxuriance of bloom in wet places near running water; they\r\nmay not be esteemed beautiful by all, and yet all God's works, and all his\r\nflowers, are good and beautiful. Let any one see them as I have seen them,\r\na large flowerbed of an acre and more, one mass of the brightest yellow, a\r\ncrystal stream meandering through their midst, the beautiful Falls of\r\nMontmorenci across the river rolling their deep strains of Nature's music,\r\nthe rising tide of the St. Lawrence beating with refreshing waves at their\r\nfeet, and a cloudless azure sky over head, from which the rosy tints of\r\nearly morn had hardly disappeared, and if his soul be not ready to\r\noverflow with gratitude to the Supreme Being who has made everything so\r\nbeautiful and good, I do not know what to think of him. I would not be\r\nsuch a man, 'I'd rather be a dog and bay the moon.'\"\r\n\r\nThe whole Gomin bog is studded with Smilacina _Bifolia_, sometimes\r\nerroneously called _the white lily of the valley_, also the Smilacina\r\n_Trifolia_, the _Dentaria_, the _Streptopus roseus_ or twisted stem, a\r\nrose-colored flower, bearing red berries in the fall. There are also in\r\nthis wood, _trillium_, the May flower, _Hepatica_, and _Symplocarpus_,\r\nthickets crowned with _Rhodoras_ in full bloom--a bush a few feet high\r\nwith superb rose-colored flowers--the general appearance of a cluster of\r\nbushes is most magnificent. In the same locality, further in the swamp,\r\nmay be found the _Kalmia angustifolia_ bearing very pretty compact rose-\r\ncolored flowers like small cups divided into five lobes, also the\r\nbeautiful Ladies' Slipper Orchis (_Cypripedum humile_) in thousands on the\r\nborders of the swamp,--such is Sillery wood in May. The crowded flora of\r\nJune is the very carnival of nature, in our climes. \"Our Parish\" is no\r\nexception. The Ladies' Slippers, _Kalmia Smilacina_, etc., may still\r\nbe gathered in the greatest abundance throughout most of this month. Here\r\nis also the bunch of Pigeon berry, in full bloom, the Brooklime Spedwell,\r\nthe Blue-eyed-grass, the herb Bennet, the Labrador Tea, the _Oxalis\r\nStricta_ and _Oxalis acetosella_, one with yellow, the other with\r\nwhite and purple flowers: the first grows in ploughed fields, the second\r\nin the woods. \"Our sensitive plant; they shut up their leaves and go to\r\nsleep at night, and on the approach of rain. These plants are used in\r\nEurope to give an acid flavor to soup.\" Here also flourishes the Linnea\r\nBorealis, roseate bells, hanging like twins from one stalk, downy and\r\naromatic all round. In the middle of June, the Ragwort, a composite flower\r\nwith yellow heads, and about one-half to two feet high, abounds in wet\r\nplaces by the side of running streams. Also, the Anemone, so famous in\r\nEnglish song, principally represented by the Anemone Pennsylvanica,\r\ngrowing on wet banks, bearing large white flowers; add the Corydalis,\r\n_Smilacina racemosa_ resembling Solomon's Seal. Here we light on a lovely\r\nTulip bed; no--'tis that strangely beautiful flower, the pitcher plant\r\n(_Saracenia Purpurea_). Next we hit on a flower not to be forgotten, the\r\n_Myosotis palustris_ or Forget-me-not. Cast a glance as you hurry onwards\r\non the _Oenothera pumila_, a kind of evening primrose, on the false\r\nHellebore--the one-sided Pyrola, the Bladder Campion--_silene inflata_,\r\nthe sweet-scented yellow Mellilot, the white Yarran, the Prunella with\r\nblue labrate flowers the Yellow Rattle, so called from the rattling of the\r\nseeds. The perforated St. John's Wort is now coming into flower\r\neverywhere, and will continue until late in August; it is an upright\r\nplant, from one to two feet high, with clusters of yellow flowers. The\r\nGermans have a custom for maidens to gather this herb on the eve of St.\r\nJohn, and from its withering or retaining its freshness to draw an augury\r\nof death or marriage in the coming year. This is well told in the\r\nfollowing lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"The young maid stole through the cottage door,\r\n  And blushed as she sought the plant of power;\r\n  Then silver glow-worm, O lend me thy light,\r\n  I must gather the mystic St. John's Wort to-night,\r\n  The wonderful herb whose leaf must decide\r\n  If the coming year shall make me a bride.\r\n      And the glow-worm came\r\n      With its silvery flame,\r\n      And sparkled and shone\r\n      Through the night of St. John;\r\n  While it shone on the plant as it bloomed in its pride,\r\n  And soon has the young maid her love-knot tied.\r\n      With noiseless tread\r\n      To her chamber she sped,\r\n  Where the spectral moon her white beams shed.\r\n\r\n  \"Bloom here, bloom here, thou plant of power,\r\n  To deck the young bride in her bridal hour;\r\n  But it dropped its head, the plant of power,\r\n  And died the mute death of the voiceless flower\r\n  And a withered wreath on the ground it lay,\r\n  And when a year had passed away,\r\n  All pale on her bier the young maid lay;\r\n      And the glow-worm came,\r\n      With its silvery flame,\r\n      And sparkled and shone\r\n      Through the night of St. John;\r\n  And they closed the cold grave o'er the maid's cold clay,\r\n  On the day that was meant for her bridal day.\"\r\n\r\nLet us see what flowers sultry July has in store for us in her bountiful\r\ncornucopia. \"In July,\" says a fervent lover of nature, \"bogs and swamps\r\nare glorious indeed,\" so look out for Calopogons, Pogonias, rose-colored\r\nand white and purple-fringed Orchises, Ferns, some thirty varieties, of\r\nexquisite texture,\r\n\r\n  \"In the cool and quiet nooks,\r\n    By the side of running brooks;\r\n  In the forest's green retreat,\r\n    With the branches overhead,\r\n  Nestling at the old trees' feet,\r\n    Choose we there our mossy bed.\r\n\r\n  On tall cliffs that won the breeze,\r\n    Where no human footstep presses,\r\n  And no eye our beauty sees,\r\n    There we wave our maiden tresses,\"\r\n\r\nthe Willow-herb, the true Partridge-berry, the Chimaphila, Yellow Lily,\r\nMullein, Ghost Flower, Indian Pipe, Lysimacha Stricta, Wild Chamomile.\r\nAugust will bring forth a variety of other plants, amongst others the\r\nSpirantes, or Ladies' Tresses, a very sweet-scented Orchis, with white\r\nflowers placed as a spiral round the flower stalk, the purple Eupatorium,\r\nthe Snake's head, and crowds of most beautiful wild flowers, too numerous\r\nto be named here. [244] (From _Maple Leaves_, 1865).\r\n\r\n\r\n_BEAUVOIR._\r\n\r\n    \"The merchant has his snug retreat in the vicinity of the metropolis,\r\n    where he often displays as much pride and zeal in the cultivation of\r\n    his flower garden, and the maturing of his fruits, as he does in the\r\n    conduct of his business, and the success of a commercial enterprise.\"\r\n    --_Rural Life in England--Washington Irving_.\r\n\r\nSituated on the left bank of the River St. Lawrence, about four miles from\r\nthe city, on the Sillery heights, and overlooking the river. The site was\r\nselected about half a century back by the late Hon. A. N. Cochrane, who\r\nacquired the property in September, 1830, and after holding it for\r\nnineteen years sold it to the Hon. John Stewart, who built the residence,\r\nwhich was occupied for a number of years by the late Henry LeMesurier,\r\nEsq., and was finally destroyed by fire in 1866. It was subsequently\r\nrebuilt, and afterwards purchased by the present occupant R. R. Dobell,\r\nEsq., who has since added considerably to the building and extended the\r\nproperty by the addition of about twelve acres purchased from the Graddon\r\nestate, and about the same quantity purchased from Mr. McHugh, the whole\r\nnow comprising about thirty-five acres. The grounds are beautifully wooded\r\nand descend by a series of natural terraces to the river, on the banks of\r\nwhich are the extensive timber coves and wharves known as Sillery Cove,\r\nwith the workmen's cottages, offices, &c., fringing the side. There is\r\nalso telegraphic communication between this cove and the city. Here too is\r\nthe site of the ancient church of the Récollet Fathers, within the\r\nprecincts of which lie buried the remains of Rev. Ed. Massé, one of the\r\nearliest missionaries sent from France to Canada by the Jesuits, the\r\nexpense of the mission was chiefly borne by the Chevalier Brulart de\r\nSillery. Here also is the old MANSION HOUSE, and a little higher up the\r\ncliff is the ancient burial ground of the Huron Indians, where the remains\r\nof many of this tribe can still be found. The property is bounded on the\r\nwest by the historical stream of St. Michaels brook, so often mentioned in\r\nthe narratives of the siege of Quebec in 1759. This stream used to be well\r\nstocked with trout, and promises to regain its former character in this\r\nrespect, as the present proprietor intends to re-stock it.\r\n\r\nMr. Dobell has collected here some very fine specimens of Canadian Game,\r\nwhich the art of the taxidermist has rendered very life-like. His oil\r\npaintings are deserving of notice and attracted attention at a recent\r\nexhibition of art, &c., at the Morrin College, they appear in the printed\r\ncatalogue as follows:--\r\n\r\n  A Scene in Wales, (Morning).............. by Marcham.\r\n  A Scene in Wales, (Evening)..............    \"\r\n  Reading the Bible, ......................    \"\r\n  Our Saviour,--an old painting on copper..\r\n  Dead Canary,.............................

Mr. Dobell the proprietor is largely engaged in mercantile\r\noperations, and for many years past has carried on the most extensive\r\nbusiness in the lumber trade.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 we alluded as follows to this bright Canadian Home, which the\r\nshadow of death was soon to darken:\r\n\r\n\"Crowning a sloping lawn, intersected by a small stream, and facing the\r\nEtchemin Mills, you notice on the south side of the St. Lewis road, next\r\nto Clermont, a neat dwelling hid amongst huge pines and other forest\r\ntrees; that is one of our oldest English country seats. Family memories of\r\nthree generations consecrate the spot. Would you like a glimpse of\r\ndomestic life as enjoyed at Sillery? then follow that bevy of noisy, rosy-\r\ncheeked boys in Lennoxville caps, with gun and rod in hand, hurrying down\r\nthose steep, narrow steps leading from the bank to the Cove below. How\r\nthey scamper along, eager to walk the deck of that trim little craft, the\r\n_Falcon_, anchored in the stream, and sitting like a bird on the bosom of\r\nthe famed river. Wait a minute and you will see the mainsail flutter in\r\nthe breeze. Now our rollicking young friends have marched past ruins of\r\n\"chapel, convent, hospital,\" &c., on the beach; you surely did not expect\r\nthem to look glum and melancholy. Of course they knew all about \"Monsieur\r\nPuiseaux,\" \"le Chevalier de Sillery,\" \"the house where dwelt Emily\r\nMontague\"; but do not, if you have any respect for that thrice happy age,\r\nthe halcyon days of jackets and frills, befog their brains with the musty\r\nrecords of departed years. Let the lads enjoy their summer vacation,\r\nradiant, happy, heedless of the future. Alas! it may yet overtake them\r\nsoon enough! What care could contract their brow? Have they not fed for\r\nthe day their rabbits, their pigeons, their guinea-pigs? Is not that\r\nfaithful Newfoundland dog \"Boatswain,\" who saved from drowning one of\r\ntheir school-mates, is he not as usual their companion on ship-board or\r\nashore? There, now, they drop down the stream for a long day's cruise\r\nround the Island of Orleans. Next week, peradventure, you may hear of the\r\n_Falcon_ and its jolly crew having sailed for Portneuf, Murray Bay, the\r\nSaguenay or Bersimis, to throw a cast for salmon, sea-trout or mackerel,\r\nin some sequestered pool or sheltered bay.\r\n\r\n  \"There we'll drop our lines, and gather\r\n  Old Ocean's treasures in.\"\r\n\r\nAre they not glorious, handsome, manly fellows, our Sillery boys? No\r\nwonder we are all proud of them, of the twins as much as the rest, and\r\nmore so perhaps. \"Our Parish\" you must know, is renowned for the\r\nproportion in which it contributes to the census: twins--a common\r\noccurrence; occasionally, triplets.\r\n\r\nSuch we knew this Canadian home in the days of the late Henry Lemesurier.\r\n\r\n\r\n_MONTAGUE COTTAGE._\r\n\r\n  \"I knew by the smoke which so gracefully curled,\r\n  Above the green wood that a cottage was near.\"\r\n                       --_Moore's Woodpecker._\r\n\r\nFacing Sillery hill, on the north side of \"Sans Bruit,\" formerly the\r\nestate of Lieut.-Col. the Hon.

Vol. I of the Work, page 61, states; \"I am at present at an\r\nextremely pretty farm on the banks of the River St. Lawrence, the house\r\nstands as the foot of a steep mountain covered with a variety of trees\r\nforming a verdant sloping wall, which rises in a kind of regular\r\nconfusion, shade above shade a woody theatre, and has in front this noble\r\nriver, on which ships continually passing present to the delighted eye the\r\nmost charming picture imaginable.

Yours,\r\n\r\nARABELLA FERMOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THE HISTORY OF EMILY MONTAGUE._\r\n\r\n    On the 22nd March 1769, a novelist of some standing Mrs. Frances\r\n    Brooks an officer's lady, [247] author of _Lady Julia Mandeville_\r\n    published in London a work in four volumes, which she dedicated to His\r\n    Excellency the Governor of Canada, Guy Carleton afterwards Lord\r\n    Dorchester, under the title of the _History of Emily Montague_ being a\r\n    series of letters addressed from Sillery by Emily Montague the heroine\r\n    of the tale, to her lively and witty friend Bella Fermor--to some\r\n    military admirers in Quebec, Montreal, and New York--to some British\r\n    noblemen, friends of her father.\r\n\r\n    This novel, whether it was through the writer's _entourage_ in\r\n    the world or her _entrée_ to fashionable circles, or whether on\r\n    account of its own intrinsic literary worth, had an immense success in\r\n    its day. The racy description it contains of Canadian scenery, and\r\n    colonial life, mixed with the fashionable gossip of our Belgravians of\r\n    1766, seven years after the conquest, caused several English families\r\n    to emigrate to Canada. Some settled in the neighborhood of Quebec, at\r\n    Sillery, it is said. Whether they found all things _couleur-de-\r\n    rose_, as the clever Mrs. Brooke had described them,--whether they\r\n    enjoyed as much Arcadian bliss as the Letters of _Emily Montague_\r\n    had promised--it would be very ungallant for us to gainsay, seeing\r\n    that Mrs. Brooke is not present to vindicate herself. As to the\r\n    literary merit of the novel, this much we will venture to assert, that\r\n    setting aside the charm of association, we doubt that _Emily\r\n    Montague_ if republished at present, would make the fortune of her\r\n    publisher. Novel writing, like other things, has considerably changed\r\n    since 1766, and however much the florid Richardson style may have\r\n    pleased the great grandfathers of the present generation, it would\r\n    scarcely chime in with the taste of readers in our sensational times.\r\n    In Mrs. Brooke's day Quebecers appear to have amused themselves pretty\r\n    much as they do now, a century later. In the summer, riding, driving\r\n    boating, pic-nics at Lake St. Charles, the Falls of Montmorenci, &c.\r\n    In winter tandems, sleigh drives, toboganing at the ice cone, tomycod\r\n    fishing on the St. Charles, Château balls; the formation of a\r\n    _pont_ or ice-bridge and its breaking up in the spring--two events of\r\n    paramount importance. The military, later on, the promoters of\r\n    conviviality, sport and social amusements; in return obtaining the\r\n    _entrée_ to the houses of the chief citizens; toying with every\r\n    English rosebud or Gallic-lily, which might strew their path in spite\r\n    of paternal and maternal admonitions from the other side of the\r\n    Atlantic; occasionally leading to the hymeneal altar a Canadian bride,\r\n    and next introducing her to their horror-stricken London relatives,\r\n    astounded to find out that our Canadian belles, were neither the\r\n    colour of copper, nor of ebony; in education and accomplishments,\r\n    their equals--sometimes their superiors when class is compared to\r\n    class. Would you like a few extracts from this curious old Sillery\r\n    novel? Bella Fermor, one of Emily Montague's familiars, and a most\r\n    ingrained _coquette_, thus writes from Sillery in favour of a\r\n    military protégé on the 16th September, 1766, to the \"divine\" Emily,\r\n    who had just been packed oft to Montreal to recover from a love fit.\r\n    \"Sir George is handsome as an Adonis ... you allow him to be of an\r\n    amiable character; he is rich, young, well-born, and he loves you...\"\r\n\r\n    All in vain thus to plead Sir. George's cause, a dashing Col. Rivers\r\n    (meant, we were told, by the Hon. W. Sheppard, to personify Col. Henry\r\n    Caldwell, of Belmont) had won the heart of Emily, who preferred true\r\n    love to a coronet. Let us treasure up a few more sentences fallen from\r\n    Emily's light-hearted confidante. A postscript to a letter runs thus--\r\n    \"Adieu, Emily, I am going to ramble in the woods and pick berries with\r\n    a little smiling civil captain [we can just fancy we see some of our\r\n    fair acquaintances' mouths water at such a prospect], who is enamoured\r\n    of me. A pretty rural amusement for lovers.\" Decidedly; all this in\r\n    the romantic woodlands of Sillery, a sad place it must be confessed,\r\n    when even boarding school misses, were they to ramble thus, could\r\n    scarcely escape contracting the _scarlet_ fever. Here goes another\r\n    extract:--\r\n\r\n    (BELLA FERMOR TO MISS RIVERS. LONDON)\r\n\r\n    \"Sillery, Sept. 20th, (1766)--10 o'clock.\r\n\r\n    \"Ah! we are vastly to be pitied; no beaux at all at the general's,\r\n    only about six to one; a pretty proportion, and what I hope always to\r\n    see. We--the ladies I mean--drink chocolate with the general to-\r\n    morrow, and he gives us a ball on Thursday; you would not know Quebec\r\n    again. Nothing but smiling faces now: all gay as never was--the\r\n    sweetest country in the world. Never expect to see me in England\r\n    again; one is really somebody here. I have been asked to dance by only\r\n    twenty-seven. ...\"\r\n\r\n    Ah! who would not forgive the frolicsome Bella all her flirtations?\r\n    But before we dismiss this pleasant record of other days, yet another\r\n    extract, and we have done.\r\n\r\n    (BELLA FERMOR TO LUCY RIVERS)\r\n\r\n    \"Sillery--Eight in the evening.\r\n\r\n    \"Absolutely, Lucy, I will marry a savage and turn squaw (a pretty soft\r\n    name for an Indian Princess!)

There were six\r\n    women and two or three children, without one man amongst them. They\r\n    landed and tied the canoe to the root of a tree, and finding out the\r\n    most agreeable shady spot amongst the bushes with which the beach was\r\n    covered, (which happened to be very near me) made a fire, on which\r\n    they laid some fish to broil, and fetching water from the river, sat\r\n    down on the grass to their frugal repast. I stole softly to the house,\r\n    and ordering a servant to bring some wine and cold provisions,\r\n    returned to my squaws.

FERMOR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKIRK ELLA\r\n\r\n\"This villa, erected in 1850 on the north side of the St. Lewis road,\r\nfacing Cataracoui, affords a striking exemplification of how soon taste\r\nand capital can transform a wilderness into a habitation combining every\r\nappliance of modern refinement and rustic adornment. It covers about\r\neighty-two acres, two thirds of which are green meadows, wheat fields,\r\n&c., the remainder, plantations, gardens and lawn. The cottage itself is a\r\nplain, unpretending structure, made more roomy by the recent addition of a\r\ndining room, &c., in rear. On emerging from the leafy avenue, the visitor\r\nnotices two _parterres_ of wild flowers--kalmias, trilliums, etc.,--\r\ntransplanted from the neighboring wood, with the rank, moist soil of the\r\nGomin marsh to derive nourishment from, they appear to thrive. In rear of\r\nthese _parterres_ a granite rockery, festooned with ferns, wild\r\nviolets, &c., raises its green gritty, rugged outline. This pretty\r\nEuropean embellishment we would much like to see more generally introduced\r\nin our Canadian landscape; it is strikingly picturesque. The next object\r\nwhich catches the eye is the conservatory in which are displayed the most\r\nextensive collection of exotics in Sillery. In the centre of some fifty\r\nlarge camellia shrubs there is a magnificent specimen of the fimbriata\r\nvariety--white leaves with a fringed border; it stands twelve feet high\r\nwith corresponding breadth. When it is loaded with blossoms in the winter\r\nthe spectacle is exquisitely beautiful. In the rear of the conservatory\r\nare a vinery, a peach and apricot house; like the conservatory, all span-\r\nroofed and divided off in several compartments, heated by steam-pipes and\r\nfurnaces, with stop-cocks to retard or accelerate vegetation at will. On\r\nthe 31st May, when we visited the establishment, we found the black\r\nHamburg grapes the size of cherries; the peaches and apricots\r\ncorrespondingly advanced; the cherries under glass quite over. One of the\r\nlatest improvements is a second flower garden to the west of the house, in\r\nthe English landscape style. In rear of this garden to the north, there\r\nexisted formerly a cedar swamp, which deep subsoil draining with tiles has\r\nconverted into a grass meadow of great beauty; a belt of pine, spruce,\r\ntamarack, and some deciduous trees, thinned towards the south-west, let in\r\na glimpse of the St. Lawrence and the high-wooded Point Levi shores,\r\nshutting out the view of the St. Lewis road, and completely overshadowing\r\nthe porter's lodge; out-houses, stables, root-house, paddocks and barns\r\nare all on a correspondingly extensive scale. We have here another\r\ninstance of the love of country life which our successful Canadian\r\nmerchant likes to indulge in; and we can fancy, judging from our own case,\r\nwith what zest Mr. Burstall the portly laird of Kirk Ella, after a\r\ntoilsome day in his St. Peter street counting-house, hurried home to revel\r\nin the rustic beauty which surrounds his dwelling.\" Such was Kirk Ella in\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nMr. Burstall having withdrawn from business, removed to England and died\r\nthere a few years back. Kirk Ella has now become the property of Charles\r\nErnest Levey, Esq., only son of the late Charles E. Levey, Esq., formerly\r\nof Cataracoui. The dwelling having been destroyed by fire in 1879, the new\r\nowner decided on erecting a handsome roomy mansion on the same site. The\r\nvisitor at Kirk Ella, after paying his devoirs to the youthful Chatelain\r\nand Chatelaine, can admire at leisure Mr. Levey's numerous and expensive\r\nstud: \"Lollypop\", \"Bismark,\" \"Joker,\" \"Jovial,\" \"Tichborne,\" \"Burgundy,\"\r\n\"Catch-him-alivo,\" a crowd of fleet steeds, racing and trotting stock,\r\nsurrounded by a yelping and frisky pack of \"Peppers,\" \"Mustards,\"\r\n\"Carlos,\" \"Guys,\" \"Josephines,\" \"Fidlers;\" Mastiffs, French Poodles, Fox\r\nTerriers, Bulldogs,--Kirk Ella is a perfect Elysium for that faithful\r\nthough noisy friend of man, the dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CATARACOUI._\r\n\r\nThe conflagration of Spencer Wood, on the 12th March, 1860, made it\r\nincumbent on the Provincial Government to provide for His Excellency Sir\r\nEdmund Head a suitable residence. After examining several places,\r\nCataracoui, the residence of Henry Burstall, Esquire, opposite to Kirk\r\nElla was selected, and additions made, and still greater decorations and\r\nimprovements ordered when it became known that the First Gentleman in\r\nEngland, our Sovereign's eldest son, was soon to pay a flying visit to Her\r\nMajesty's Canadian lieges. Cataracoui can boast of having harbored two\r\nprinces of the blood royal, the prince of Wales, and his brother Alfred; a\r\ncircumstance which no doubt much enhanced its prestige in the eyes of its\r\nowner. It was laid out about 1836 by Jas. B. Forsyth, Esq., the first\r\nproprietor, and reflects credit on his taste.\r\n\r\nThis seat, without possessing the extensive grounds, vast river frontage,\r\nand long shady walks of Spencer Wood, or Woodfield, is an eminently\r\npicturesque residence. A new grapery with a lean-to roof, about ninety\r\nfeet in length, has just been completed: the choicest [248] varieties of\r\nthe grape vine are here cultivated. Several tasty additions have, also,\r\nrecently been made to the conservatory, under the superintendence of a\r\nScotch landscape gardener, Mr. P. Lowe, formerly in charge of the Spencer\r\nWood conservatories, &c. We had the pleasure on one occasion to view, on a\r\npiercing winter day, from the drawing room of Cataracoui, through the\r\nglass door which opens on the conservatory, the rare collections of\r\nexotics it contains,--a perfect grove of verdure and blossoms,--the whole\r\nlit up by the mellow light of the setting sun, whose rays scintillated in\r\nevery fantastic form amongst this gorgeous tropical vegetation, whilst the\r\nsnow-wreathed evergreens, surrounding the conservatory waved their palms\r\nto the orb of day in our clear, bracing Canadian atmosphere--summer and\r\nwinter combined in one landscape; the tropics and their luxuriant\r\nmagnolias, divided by an inch of glass from the realms of old king frost\r\nand his hardy familiars, the pine and the maple. Charming was the\r\ncontrast, furnishing a fresh proof of the comfort and luxury with which\r\nthe European merchant, once settled in Canada, surrounds his home. What,\r\nindeed, can be more gratifying, during the arctic, though healthy,\r\ntemperature of our winter, than to step from a cosy drawing-room, with its\r\ncheerful grate-fire, into a green, floral bower, and inhale the aroma of\r\nthe orange and the rose, whilst the eye is charmed by the blossoming\r\ncamellia of virgin whiteness; the wisteria, spirea, azalea, rhododendron,\r\nand odorous daphne, all blending their perfume or exquisite tints.\r\nCataracoui has been recently decorated, we may say, with regal\r\nmagnificence, and Sillery is justly proud of this fairy abode, for years\r\nthe country seat of the late Charles B. Levey, Esq., and still occupied by\r\nMrs. Levey and family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ROSEWOOD._\r\n\r\n  \"Along their blushing borders, bright with dew,\r\n  And in yon mingled wilderness of flowers,\r\n  Fair-handed Spring unbosoms every grace;\r\n  Throws out the snow-drop and the crocus first;\r\n  The daisy, primrose, violet darkly blue,\r\n  And polyanthus of unnumber'd dyes;\r\n  The yellow wall-flower, stain'd with iron-brown;\r\n  And lavish stock that scents the garden round;\r\n  From the soft wing of vernal breezes shed,\r\n  Anemones; auriculas, enrich'd\r\n  With shining meal o'er all their velvet leaves;\r\n  And full ranunculas, of glowing red.\r\n  Then comes the tulip race, where beauty plays\r\n  Her idle freaks; from family diffus'd\r\n  To family, as flies the father dust,\r\n  The varied colors run; and while they break\r\n  On the charm'd eye th' exulting florist marks,\r\n  With sweet pride, the wonders of his hand.\r\n  No gradual bloom is wanting; from the bud,\r\n  First-born of spring, to summer's musky tribes\r\n  Nor hyacinths, of purest virgin white,\r\n  Low bent, and blushing inward; nor jonquils\r\n  Of potent fragrance; nor narcissus fair,\r\n  As o'er the fabled fountain hanging still;\r\n  Nor broad carnations, nor gay spotted pink;\r\n  Nor, shower'd from every bush, the damask rose.\"\r\n\r\nA tiny and unostentatious cottage buried among the trees. All around it,\r\nfirst, flowers; secondly, flowers; thirdly, flowers. The garden, a network\r\nof walks, and spruce hedges of rare beauty; occasionally you stumble\r\nunexpectedly on a rustic bower, tenanted by an Apollo or Greek slave in\r\nmarble, or else you find yourself on turning an angle on the shady bank of\r\na sequestered pond, in which lively trout disport themselves as merrily as\r\nthose goldfish you just noticed in the aquarium in the hall hung round\r\nwith Krieghoff's exquisite \"Canadian scenery.\" You can also, as you pass\r\nalong, catch the loud notes issuing from the house aviary and blending\r\nwith the soft, wild melody of the wood warblers and robin; but the\r\nprominent feature of the place are flowers, sweet flowers, to charm the\r\neye and perfume the air. Do not wonder at that; this was the summer abode\r\nof a gentleman whose name usually stood high on the Montreal and Quebec\r\nexhibition prize list, and who was as successful in his commercial\r\nventures as he had been in the culture of carnations, zenias, gladiolus,\r\nroses and dahlias. We remember seeing six hundred dahlias in bloom at\r\nRosewood at the same time, the _coup d'oeil_ and contrasts between\r\nthe varieties were striking in the extreme.\r\n\r\nThis rustic cottage was the summer residence of the late Jas. Gibb, Esq.,\r\nof the old firm of Lane, Gibb & Co., a name remembered with gratitude, in\r\nseveral educational and charitable institutions of Quebec for the\r\nmunificent bequests of its owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n _RAVENSWOOD._\r\n\r\n  Near some fair town I'd have a private seat,\r\n  Built uniform, nor little, nor too great;\r\n  Better if on a rising ground it stood,--\r\n  On this side fields, on that a neighboring wood;\r\n  A little garden, grateful to the eye,\r\n  Where a cool rivulet runs murmuring by.\"\r\n\r\nIn the year 1848, Mr. Samuel Wright, of Quebec, purchased from John\r\nPorter, Esq., that upper portion of Meadowbank (the old estate of\r\nLieutenant Governor Cramahé in 1762), which lies to the north of the Cap\r\nRouge or St. Lewis road, and built a dwelling thereon. In 1846 Mr.\r\nWright's property was put in the market, and Ravenswood acquired by the\r\npresent owner, William Herring, Esq., of the late firm of Charles E. Levey\r\n& Co. No sylvan spot could have been procured, had all the woods around\r\nQuebec been ransacked, of wilder beauty. In the centre, a pretty cottage;\r\nto the east, trees; to the west, trees; to the north and south, trees--\r\nstately trees all around you. Within a few rods from the hall door a\r\nlimpid little brook oozes from under an old plantation, and forms, under a\r\nthorn tree of extraordinary size and most fantastically shaped limbs, a\r\nreservoir of clear water, round which, from a rustic seat, you notice\r\nspeckled trout roaming fearlessly. Here was, for a man familiar with the\r\npark-like scenery of England, a store of materials to work into shape.\r\nThat dense forest must be thinned; that indispensable adjunct of every\r\nSillery home a velvety lawn, must be had; a peep through the trees, on the\r\nsurrounding country, obtained; the stream dammed up so as to produce a\r\nsheet of water, on which a birch canoe will be launched; more air let in\r\nround the house; more of the forest cut away; and some fine beech, birch,\r\nmaple, and pine trees grouped. The lawn would look better with a graceful\r\nand leafy elm in the centre, and a few smaller ones added to the\r\nperspective. By dint of care, elms of a goodly size were removed from the\r\nmountain brow. The efforts of the proprietor to plant large trees at\r\nRavenswood have been eminently successful, and ought to stimulate others\r\nto add such valuable, such permanent elements of beauty, to their country\r\nseats. One plantation, by its luxuriance, pleased us more than any other,\r\nthat which shades both sides of the avenue. Few of our places can boast of\r\npossessing a more beautifully-wooded and gracefully-curved approach to the\r\nhouse than Ravenswood. You see nothing of the dwelling until you emerge\r\nfrom this neat plantation of evergreens. We once viewed it under its most\r\nfascinating aspect; 'tis pretty in the bright, effulgent radiance of day,\r\nbut when the queen of night sends forth her soft rays, and allows them to\r\nslumber silently on the rustling boughs of the green pines and firs, with\r\nthe dark, gravelled avenue, visible here and there at every curve, no\r\nsounds heard except the distant murmur of the _Chaudière_ river, the\r\neffect is striking.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THE WOODS OF SILLERY._\r\n\r\n      I know each lane, and every valley green,\r\n        Dingle, or bushy dell, of this wild wood;\r\n      And every bosky bourn from side to side,\r\n        My daily walks and ancient neighborhood.\r\n                     --Comus, _Shakespeare_.\r\n\r\n    \"You, doubtless, imagine you have now seen Sillery under every aspect;\r\n    there never was a greater mistake, dear reader. Have you ever viewed\r\n    its woods in all their autumnal glory, when September arrays them in\r\n    tints of unsurpassed loveliness? We hear you say, no. Let us then, our\r\n    pensive philosopher, our romantic blushing rose bud of sweet sixteen,\r\n    our _blasé_-traveller, let us have a canter over Cap Rouge road\r\n    out by St. Louis gate, and returning by the St. Foy road, nine miles\r\n    and more, let us select a quiet afternoon, not far distant from the\r\n    Indian summer, when\r\n\r\n       The gentle wind a sweet and passionate wooer,\r\n      Kisses the blushing leaf, and stirs up life\r\n      Within the solemn woods of ash, deep crimsoned,\r\n      And Silver beech, and maple yellow-leaved,\"\r\n\r\n    and then you can tell us whether the glowing description below is\r\n    overdrawn:\r\n\r\n    \"There is something indescribably beautiful in the appearance of\r\n    Canadian woods at this season of the year, especially when the light\r\n    of the rising or setting sun falls upon them. Almost every imaginable\r\n    shade of green, brown, red and yellow, may be found in the foliage of\r\n    our forest trees, shrubs, and creeping vines, as the autumn advances\r\n    and it may truly be said that every backwood's home in Canada is\r\n    surrounded by more gorgeous colourings and richer beauties than the\r\n    finest mansions of the nobility of England.\r\n\r\n    \"Have our readers ever remarked the peculiarly beautiful appearance of\r\n    the pines at this season of the year? When other trees manifest\r\n    symptoms of withering, they appear to put forth a richer and fresher\r\n    foliage. The interior of the tree, when shaded from the sun, is a deep\r\n    invisible-green, approaching to black, whilst the outer boughs,\r\n    basking in the sunlight, show the richest dark-green that can be\r\n    imagined. A few pine and spruce trees scattered among the more\r\n    brightly-colored oaks, maple, elms and beeches, which are the chief\r\n    denizens of our forests, give the whole an exceedingly rich\r\n    appearance. Among the latter, every here and there, strange sports of\r\n    nature attract attention. A tree that is still green will have a\r\n    single branch, covered with red and orange leaves, like a gigantic\r\n    bouquet of flowers. Another will have one side of a rich maroon,\r\n    whilst the other side remains green. A third will present a flounce or\r\n    ruffle of bright buff, or orange leaves round the middle, whilst the\r\n    branches above and below continue green. Then again some trees which\r\n    have turned to a rich brown, will be seen intertwined and festooned by\r\n    the wild vine or red root, still beautifully green; or a tree that is\r\n    still green will he mantled over by the Canadian ivy, whose leaves\r\n    have turned to a deep reddish-brown. In fact, every hue that painters\r\n    love, or almost could imagine, is found standing out boldly or hid\r\n    away in some recess, in one part or another of a forest scene at this\r\n    season, and all so delicately mingled and blended that human art must\r\n    despair of making even a tolerable imitation. And these are beauties\r\n    which not even the sun can portray; the photographer's art has not yet\r\n    enabled him to seize and fix them on the mirror which he holds up to\r\n    nature. He can give the limbs and outward flourishes, but not the soul\r\n    of such a scene. His representation bears the same relation to the\r\n    reality that a beautiful corpse does to the flashing eye and glowing\r\n    cheek of living beauty.\"--(From \"_Maple Leaves_,\" 1865.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_LONGWOOD._\r\n\r\n  THE COUNTRY SEAT OF THE HON. WM. SMITH\r\n  (1760-1847.)\r\n\r\n  Here there was laughing of old, there was weeping,\r\n    Haply of lovers none ever will know,\r\n  Whose eyes went seaward a hundred sleeping\r\n                             Years ago.\r\n\r\n  The ghost of a garden fronts the sea,\r\n    A girdle of brushwood and thorn encloses\r\n  The -- square slope of the blossomless bed\r\n    Where the weeds that grew green from the graves of its roses\r\n                             Now lie dead.\r\n\r\n  The fields fall southward, abrupt and broken,\r\n    To the low last edge of the long lone land,\r\n  If a step should sound or a word be spoken\r\n    Would a ghost not rise at the strange guest's hand?\r\n                        SWINBURNE'S _Forsaken Garden_.\r\n\r\nOn a grey, cheerless May afternoon, I visited what I might call the ruins\r\nof this once bright abode--Longwood--at Cap Rouge. Here the eccentric,\r\ninfluential and scholarly historian of Canada and statesman, the Honorable\r\nWilliam Smith, spent the evening of his long and busy life. Whence the\r\nname Longwood? Did the Hon. William bestow on his rustic home the name of\r\nthe residence where sojourned his illustrious contemporary--his admired\r\nhero, Napoleon I. (born like himself in 1769), to commemorate his own\r\nrelease from the cares of State? Was Cap Rouge and its quiet and sylvan\r\nbowers to him a haven of rest like St. Helena might have been to the\r\n_Petit Caporal_?\r\n\r\nThe locality, at present, can only attract from its woodland views. The\r\nhouse, of one story, is about eighty feet in length by forty in breadth,\r\nof wood, with an oval window over the entrance to light up that portion of\r\nthe large attic. Its roomy lower apartments and attics must have fitted it\r\nadmirably for a summer retreat. It is painted a dull yellow; the blinds\r\nmay have been once green. When I saw it, I found it as bleak, as forlorn,\r\nas the snows and storms of many winters can well make a tenantless\r\ndwelling.\r\n\r\nOutside, the \"ghost of a garden\" had stared at me, and when the key turned\r\nand grated in the rusty old lock of this dreary tenement, with its\r\ndisjointed floors, disintegrated foundations, darkened apartments with\r\nshutters all closed, I almost thought I might encounter within the ghost\r\nof the departed historian;\r\n\r\n  All within is dark as night:\r\n    In the windows is no light;\r\n  And no murmur at the door,\r\n    So frequent on its hinge before,\r\n\r\nstill the time had been when the voice of revelry, the patter of light\r\nfeet, the meeting of many friends, had awakened gladsome echoes in these\r\nnow silent halls of Longwood. Traditions told of noted dinner parties, of\r\nfestive evenings, when Quebec could boast of a well appointed garrison,\r\nand stately frigates crowded its port.\r\n\r\nHow many balls at the Barons' Club? how many annual dinners of the\r\nVeterans of 1775, at Menut's? how many _levees_ at the old Château,\r\nhad the Laird not attended from the first, the historical levee of Dec. 6,\r\n1786, \"where the Governor-General, Lord Dorchester, monopolised the\r\nkissing,\" so graphically depicted by William's dignified papa, [249] the\r\nChief Justice, down to the jocund _fêtes champêtres_ of Sir James Craig at\r\nPowell Place immortalized by old Mr. DeGaspé--to the gay _soirees_ of the\r\nDuke of Richmond--the literary _reunions_ of the scholarly Earl of\r\nDalhousie--the routs and lawn parties at Spencer Wood.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable William Smith, a son of the learned chief Justice of New\r\nYork in 1780--of all Canada in 1785, was indeed a prominent figure in\r\nQuebec circles for more than half a century; his high, confidential and\r\nofficial duties, his eminent position as member of the Executive Council,\r\nto which his powerful protector Earl Bathurst had named him in 1814--his\r\nrefined and literary tastes, his tireless researches in Canadian annals,\r\nat a time when the founts of our history as yet unrevealed by the art of\r\nthe printer, lay dormant under heaps of decaying--though priceless--M.SS.\r\nin the damp vaults of the old Parliament Buildings; these and several\r\nother circumstances surround the memory, haunts and times of the Laird of\r\nLongwood with peculiar significance.\r\n\r\nBut for the Honorable William one bleak autumn came, when the trees he had\r\nplanted ceased to lend him their welcome shade--the roses he had reared,\r\nto send perfume to his tottering frame--the garden he had so exquisitely\r\nplanned, to gladden his aged eyes. He then bid adieu forever to the\r\ncherished old spot and retired to his town house, now the residence of\r\nHon. Chas. Alleyn, Sheriff of Quebec, [250] where those he loved received\r\nhis last farewell on the 7th December, 1847, bequeathing Longwood to his\r\nson Charles Webber Smith, who lived some years there as a bachelor, then\r\ndecked out his rustic home for an English bride and retired to England\r\nwhere he died in 1879. Desolation and silence has reigned in the halls of\r\nLongwood for many a long day, and in the not inappropriate words of\r\nSwinburne,\r\n\r\n  Not a flower to be prest of the foot that falls not.\r\n    As the heart of a dead man the seed plots are dry;\r\n  From the thickets of thorns whence the nightingale calls not,\r\n    Could she call, there were never a rose to reply.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Smith [251] concerning house-keeping, house-furnishing\r\nchâteau ceremonies, etc, at Quebec in 1786, wrote thus in a letter to his\r\nwife:\r\n\r\n    QUEBEC, 10th Dec., 1786.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Janet Smith, New York._\r\n\r\n    My dear Janet,\r\n\r\n    \"Not a line from you yet! so that our approach to within 600 miles is\r\n    less favourable to me hitherto, than when the ocean divided us by\r\n    three thousand. It is the more vexatious, as we are daily visited by\r\n    your Eastern neighbors, who, caring nothing for you, know nothing of\r\n    you, and cannot tell me whether McJoen's or the Sopy Packet is\r\n    arrived. If the latter is not over, there will be cause for ill boding\r\n    respecting Mr. Lanaudière, who, I imagine, left the channel with the\r\n    wind that brought us out.\r\n\r\n    If the packet is on the way for Falmouth, get my letters into it for\r\n    Mr. Raphbrigh, it contains a bill for £300 sterling to enable him to\r\n    pay for what you order. You have no time to spare. A January mail\r\n    often meets with easterly winds off the English coast, that blows for\r\n    months, and we shall be mortified if you arrive before the necessary\r\n    supplies, which, to be in time, must come in the ships that leave\r\n    England in March or on the beginning of April.\r\n\r\n    I have found no house yet to my fancy. None large enough to be hired.\r\n    We shall want a drawing-room, a dining or eating-room, my library, our\r\n    bedroom, one for the girls, another for Hale and William, and another\r\n    for your house-keeper and hair-dresser. Moore and another man servant\r\n    will occupy the eight. And I doubt if there is such a house to be\r\n    hired in Quebec. To say nothing of quarters for the lower servants\r\n    who, I think must be negroes from New York as cheapest and least\r\n    likely to find difficulties. My Thomas's wages are 24 guineas and with\r\n    your three from England will put us to £100 sterling per annum.\r\n\r\n    If you bring blacks from New York with you, let them be such as you\r\n    can depend upon. Our table will always want four attendants of decent\r\n    appearance. The hurry of the public arrangements prevents me from\r\n    writing, as I intended, to my friends on the other side of the water,\r\n    nor even to Janet _upon the great wish of my heart_, tell her so,\r\n    but she will know what can be done in time, for she cannot leave\r\n    England till April or May, at any time before August to be here in\r\n    good season. I have written to Vermont upon the subject of Moore Town\r\n    and hear nothing to displease me, as yet, if no mischief has been done\r\n    to our interests in that country, there will be peace, I believe; but\r\n    of this more when I have their Governor's answer to my letters. They\r\n    already ask favours and must first do justice.\r\n\r\n    Our winter is commenced and yet I was never less sensible of the\r\n    frost. The stoves of Canada, in the passages, temper the air through\r\n    all the house. I sit ordinarly by a common hearth which gives me the\r\n    thermometer at 71 or 72, nearly summer heat. The close cariole and fur\r\n    cap and cloak is a luxury only used on journeys. The cariole alone\r\n    suffices in town. The Rout of last Thursday demonstrates this: 50\r\n    ladies in bright head dresses and not a lappet or frill discomposed.\r\n    All English in the manner, except the ceremony of kissing which my\r\n    Lord D. (Dorchester) engrossed all to himself. His aide-de-camp handed\r\n    them through a room where he and I were posted to receive them. They\r\n    had given two cheek kisses and were led away to the back rooms of the\r\n    château, to which we repaired when the rush was over. The gentlemen\r\n    came in at another door. Tea, cards, etc., that till 10 o'clock and\r\n    the ceremony ended. I stole away at 9 and left your son to attend the\r\n    beauty of the evening, a Mrs. Williams, wife to a major Williams and a\r\n    daughter to Sir John Gibbons of Windford, a lady of genteel manners as\r\n    well as birth. He did not find his lodging till near midnight. We had\r\n    a dance that day at the Lt. Governor's. You must know General Hope. He\r\n    was often at General Robertson's under the name of Col. Harry Hope,\r\n    nephew to Lord Hopetown in Scotland, to Lord Darlington (by his\r\n    mother's second marriage) in England. His table is in very genteel\r\n    fashion. It reminds me that Mrs. Mallet must not forget all those\r\n    little ornaments of plate, glass, etc., that belong to a dining-room.\r\n    No water plates, the rooms don't require them, the plates being\r\n    sufficiently heated by the stoves. But water dishes are necessary for\r\n    soup and fish _fricassees_ all in the shape of the proper dishes\r\n    for such articles. Don't forget, among others, the silver gravy cups\r\n    with double cavities, the larger for hot water. They are small hand\r\n    ones, not unlike a tea pot. Mrs. Mallet will find these at all the\r\n    great shops and particularly at Jones, in Cockspur street, near\r\n    Charing Cross, where I bought my Mary's watch chain. William that\r\n    understands Latin and French letters better than his native tongue,\r\n    importunes my ordering a set of classical books, which he is welcome\r\n    to, if you can purchase at N. Y. a small bill for about £15 sterling\r\n    and enclose it in my letter to Mr. Ryland. If that is inconvenient to\r\n    you stop my letter, and I will find other means to gratify his\r\n    inclination. There is a very good library [252] here, and many private\r\n    ones at my friends. How wretched your general affairs? if our Yankey\r\n    informers speak the truth, multitudes are disposed to turn their heads\r\n    from that draught, which I thought they would not long relish. Lord D.\r\n    with the generosity and charity he always indulged, bids them welcome,\r\n    disposed as he says to favour even the independant Whigs of America,\r\n    above any other nation under heaven, for tho' no longer brethren, they\r\n    are at least our cousins, branches from the same stock.\r\n\r\n    I have infinite consolation, in having dissuaded the parties from the\r\n    steps, that led to all the calamities they have felt and still dread\r\n    and more cheerfully will grasp at the means to lessen these\r\n    afflictions, as the surest path to the greatest glory. I am solicited\r\n    from Cambridge for a gift for pious uses, and find that you have been\r\n    applied to, and probably will again. My promise shall most certainly\r\n    be fulfilled. It was to give a lot for a church. But as I told them it\r\n    was to be a gift to _Christianity_ and not to Sectarianism.\r\n    Religion and party are two different things. Tell them so that my gift\r\n    will be to all Protestants, that is to say to the majority of the town\r\n    being protestants, be the denomination what it may, and that I may not\r\n    be imposed upon, I shall put my seal to no deed, before they bring me\r\n    Dr. Rodger's certificate upon the subject. My best respects to him\r\n    with compliments to Mrs. T., Mr. Ainslie, Mr. and Mrs. Foxcraft and\r\n    all your friends.\r\n\r\n    The snapping of my wood fires makes me think of yours. Don't forget\r\n    them yourself. _Your three hundred acres of shingles_, chills the\r\n    blood in my veins.... Adieu. The broad hand of Heaven protect you!\r\n\r\n    I am, my dearest,\r\n\r\n      Most faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n      W. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n_MEADOWBANK._\r\n\r\n\"THE COUNTRY SEAT OF LIEUT.-COL. ANDREW CHARLES STUART.\r\n\r\n  Happy, is he who in a country life\r\n    Shuns more perplexing toil and jarring strife,\r\n  Who lives upon the natal soil he loves\r\n    And sits beneath his old ancestral groves.\"\r\n                       --_Downing_.\r\n\r\nFacing Ravenswood, on the road to Cape Rouge, on the breezy banks of the\r\nnoble river, there lies a magnificent expanse of verdure, with here and\r\nthere a luxuriant copse of evergreens and sugar maple. It crowns a\r\ngraceful slope of undulating meadows and cornfields. The dwelling, a\r\nplain, straggling white cottage, lies _perdu_ among the green firs\r\nand solemn pines. Over the verdant groves, glimpses of the white cottages\r\nof Levi and New Liverpool occasionally catch the eye. This rustic\r\nlandscape, pleasant at all times, becomes strikingly picturesque, at the\r\n\"fall of the leaf\"--when the rainbow-tinted foliage is, lit up by a\r\nmellow, autumnal sun. Under this favored aspect it was our happiness to\r\nview it in September, 1880.\r\n\r\n  \"Bright yellow, red and orange\r\n    The leaves came down in hosts;\r\n  The trees are Indian princes\r\n    But soon they'll turn to ghosts.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1762, this broad, wild domain was owned by Lt.-Gov. Hector Theophilus\r\nCramahé of Quebec, and according to an entry in the Diary of Judge Henry,\r\nhe apparently was still the proprietor in 1775, at the time of the\r\nblockade of Quebec. In 1785, the land passed by purchase to one of\r\nFraser's Highlanders, Capt. Cameron. It was from 1841 to 1875, the\r\ncherished abode of a cultured English gentleman, the late John Porter, the\r\nable secretary and treasurer of the Quebec Turnpike Trust. It did one good\r\nto see the courteous old bachelor, cosily seated in his ample, well\r\nselected library, surrounded by a few congenial friends, the toils of the\r\nday over--the dust of St. Peter Street shaken off. Mr. Porter was a fair\r\ntype of the well-informed English country gentleman, well read in Debrett,\r\nwith a pedigree reaching as far back as William the Norman. At his demise,\r\nhe bequeathed this splendid farm to the son of a valued old friend. Andrew\r\nChs. Stuart, Esq., of the law firm of Ross, Stuart & Stuart, Quebec, now\r\nLt.-Col. Andrew Charles Stuart, of the 8th Batt. \"Royal Rifles,\" Quebec.\r\n\r\nCol. Stuart, the possessor of ample means, having a taste for agricultural\r\npursuits, has lately become an active member of the Quebec Turf Club, as\r\nwell as a successful breeder of prize cattle. His stud is renowned all\r\nover Canada. Col. Stuart lately took up his residence at Meadowbank, since\r\nwhich time a transformation seems to have come over the land; sprightly\r\nparterres of flowers, dainty pavilions, trim hedges, rustic seats, hanging\r\nbaskets of ferns, are conspicuous, where formerly hay alone flourished. A\r\nneighboring rill has been skilfully enlisted to do duty, dammed up,\r\nbridged over, gently coaxed to meander, whimple and bubble, like\r\nTennyson's brook, here and there rippling over and rushing into cool trout\r\nponds, under the shade of moss and trees, until it leaps down to the St.\r\nLawrence.\r\n\r\nA small race-course has been laid out, south of the house, in a declivity\r\ntowards the St. Lawrence to exercise the thoroughbreds and keep healthy\r\nthe pet charger for parade days, as well as ladies' palfreys, which are\r\nnot forgotten at Meadowbank.\r\n\r\nIn an enclosure protected by stone pillars and chains, under the shade of\r\na handsome tree, may be read on a board, the following name, recently\r\ninscribed,\r\n\r\n                               \"ASTREA\"\r\n\r\nThis marks the spot where a favourite saddle-horse, who died prematurely,\r\nnow rests. All now wanting to perfect this scene of rustic beauty is a\r\ncottage _orné_ or a _Chalet Suisse_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A RAID ON MEADOWBANK IN 1775, AND HOW KING GEORGE'S FRIENDS, THE\r\n    \"QUEBEC TORIES\" WERE THEN PLUNDERED.\r\n\r\n    The following extract from Judge Henry's Diary seems to refer to the\r\n    country seat, now known as Meadowbank:\r\n\r\n    Arnold's little army had retreated to Pointe aux Trembles on the 15th\r\n    Nov. On the 2nd December, 1775, they retraced their steps to Quebec\r\n    and in the evening arrived at St. Foy. On the 12th of December, Henry\r\n    [253] says \"The officers and men still wore nothing else than the\r\n    remains of the summer clothing, which being on their back, had escaped\r\n    destruction in the disaster of the wilderness.\" At this time the snow\r\n    lay three feet deep over the whole country. One fine morning a fellow\r\n    addressed Simpson who was the only officer in quarters and said \"that\r\n    about two miles up the St. Lawrence lay a country seat of Governor\r\n    Cromie's (Cramahé?) stocked with many things they wanted and he would\r\n    be our guide. Carioles were immediately procured. The house, a neat\r\n    box, was romantically situated on the steep bank of the river, not\r\n    very distant from a chapel. [254] Though in the midst of winter the\r\n    spot displayed the elegant taste and abundant wealth of the owner. The\r\n    house was closed; knocking, the hall door was opened to us by an\r\n    Irishwoman who, of the fair sex, was the largest and most brawny that\r\n    ever came under my notice. She was the stewardess of the house. Our\r\n    questions were answered with an apparent affability and frankness. She\r\n    introduced us into the kitchen, a large apartment, well filled with\r\n    these articles which good livers think necessary to the happy\r\n    enjoyment of life. Here we observed five or six Canadian servants\r\n    huddled into a corner of the kitchen trembling with fear. Our prying\r\n    eyes soon discovered a trap door leading into the cellar. The men\r\n    entered it; firken after firken of butter,--lard, tallow, beef, pork,\r\n    fish and salt, all became a prey. While the men were rummaging below\r\n    the lieutenant descended to cause more despatch. My duty was to remain\r\n    at the end of the trap door with my back to the wall, and rifle cocked\r\n    as a sentry, keeping a strict eye on the servants. My good Irishwoman\r\n    frequently beckoned to me to descend; her drift was to catch us all in\r\n    the trap. Luckily she was comprehended. The cellar and kitchen being\r\n    thoroughly gutted, and the spoil borne to the carriages, the party\r\n    dispersed into the other apartments. Here was elegancy. The walls and\r\n    partitions were beautifully papered, and decorated with large\r\n    engravings, maps, &c., and of the most celebrated artists. A noble\r\n    view of the City of Philadelphia upon a large scale taken from the\r\n    neighborhood of Cooper's Ferry drew my attention and raised some\r\n    compunctive ideas; but war and the sciences always stand at arms\r\n    length in the contests of mankind. The latter must succumb in the\r\n    tumult. Our attention was much more attracted by the costly feather\r\n    beds, counterpanes, and charming rose blankets, which the house\r\n    afforded. Of these there was a good store and we left not a jot behind\r\n    us. The nooks and crevices in the carioles were filled with smaller\r\n    articles; several dozen of admirably finished case knives and forks;\r\n    even a set of dessert knives obtained the notice of our cupidity.\r\n    Articles of a lesser moment nor a thousandth part so useful, did not\r\n    escape the all-grasping hands of the soldiery. In a back apartment\r\n    there stood a mahogany couch or settee in a highly finished style. The\r\n    woodwork of the couch was raised on all sides by cushioning, and\r\n    costly covered by a rich figured silk. This to us was lumber, besides\r\n    our carioles were full. However, we grabbed the mattrass and pallets\r\n    all equally elegant as the couch. Having, as we thought, divested his\r\n    Excellency of all the articles of prime necessity, we departed,\r\n    ostensibly and even audibly accompanied by the pious blessings of the\r\n    stewardess for our moderation. No doubt she had her mental\r\n    reservations; on such business as this we regarded neither. Near the\r\n    chapel we met a party of Morgan's men coming to do that which we had\r\n    already done. The officer appeared chagrined when he saw the extent of\r\n    our plunder. He went on, and finally ransacked the house, and yet a\r\n    little more the stables. The joy of our men, among whom the plunder\r\n    was distributed in nearly equal portions was extravagant. Now an\r\n    operation of the human mind, which often takes place in society, and\r\n    is every day discernable by persons of observation, became clearly\r\n    obvious. Let a man once with impunity desert the strict rule of rules,\r\n    all subsequent aggression is not only increased in atrocity, but is\r\n    done without a qualm of conscience. Though our company was composed\r\n    principally of freeholders, or the sons of such, bred at home under\r\n    the strictures of religion and morality, yet when the reins of decorum\r\n    were loosed and the honorable feeling weakened, it became impossible\r\n    to administer restraint. The person of a Tory or his property became\r\n    fair game, and this at the denunciation of some base domestic villain.\r\n\r\n    On the morning following December 13, the same audacious scoundrel\r\n    again returned, and another marauding expedition started under his\r\n    guidance to a farm \"said to belong to Gov. Cromie (Cramahé?) or some\r\n    other inhabitant of Quebec. It was further than the former scene.\" The\r\n    farm-house, though low, being but one story, was capacious and\r\n    tolerably neat. The barn built of logs, with a thrashing floor in the\r\n    centre, was from 70 to 80 feet in length. The tenant, his wife and\r\n    children shuddered upon our approach. Assurances that they should be\r\n    unharmed relieved their fears. The tenant pointed out to us the horned\r\n    cattle, pigs and poultry of his landlord. These were shot down without\r\n    mercy or drove before us to our quarters. Thus we obtained a tolerable\r\n    load for our caravan, which consisted of five or six carioles. \"With\r\n    this disreputable exploit marauding ceased. A returning sense of\r\n    decency and order emanating from ourselves produced a sense of\r\n    contrition. It is a solemn truth that we plundered none but those who\r\n    were notoriously Tories and then within the walls of Quebec.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE HIGHLANDS._\r\n\r\nThe range of heights extends from Spencer Wood, west, to the black bridge\r\nover the stream at Kilmarnock, gradually recedes from the road, leaving at\r\nits foot a spacious area interspersed with green pastures, lawns, ploughed\r\nfields and plantations. On the most elevated plateau of this range stands\r\n\"The Highlands,\" a large substantial fire-brick dwelling, with an ample\r\nverandah, erected a few years back by Michael Stevenson, Esquire,\r\nmerchant, of Quebec. The site is recommended by a fine view of the river\r\nSt. Lawrence, an airy and healthy position, and the luxuriant foliage of\r\nthe spruce, pine and maple in the background. The internal arrangements of\r\nthe dwelling, whether regard be had to ventilation in summer or heating in\r\nwinter, are on the most modern and improved plan. \"The Highlands\" lie\r\nabove St. Michael's Cove teeming with historical recollections, a little\r\nto the west thereof, in front of St. Lewis road of historic renown, over\r\nwhich pranced, in 1663, the Marquis of Tracy's gaudy equipage and splendid\r\nbody-guard wearing, as history tells, the uniform of the _Gardes de la\r\nReine_. In Sept., 1759, [255] the Rochbeaucourt Cavalry, with their\r\n\"blue uniforms and neat light horses of different colours,\" scoured the\r\nheights in all directions, watching the motions of the English fleet,\r\nwhich may be seen in the plate of the siege operations, lying at anchor at\r\nSillery, ready, the huge black leviathans, to hurl destruction on the\r\ndevoted city. In 1838, we remember well noticing Lord Durham's showy\r\nequipage with outriders, thundering daily over this same road: the Earl\r\nbeing a particular admirer of the Cap Rouge scenery. This seat has passed\r\nover, by purchase, to Chas. Temple, Esq., son of our late respected\r\nfellow-townsman, Major Temple, who for a series of years served in that\r\n15th regiment, to whose prowess the Plains of Abraham bore witness during\r\nthe war of the conquest. \"The Highlands\" are now occupied by J. W.\r\nStockwell, Esquire.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _WINTER FOX HUNTING IN CANADA._\r\n\r\n    From time immemorial, Merry England has been renowned for her field\r\n    sports; prominent amongst which may be reckoned her exciting pastime\r\n    of Fox-hunting, the pride, the glory, _par excellence_ of the\r\n    roystering English squire. Many may not be aware that we also, in our\r\n    far-off Canada, have a method of Fox-hunting peculiarly our own--in\r\n    harmony with the nature of the country--adapted to the rigors of our\r\n    arctic winter season--the successful prosecution of which calls forth\r\n    more endurance, a keener sight, a more thorough knowledge of the\r\n    habits of the animal, a deeper self-control and greater sagacity, than\r\n    does the English sport; for, as the proverb truly says, \"_Pour\r\n    attraper la bête, faut être plus fin qu'elle._\" [256]\r\n\r\n    A short sketch [257] of a Canadian Fox-hunt may not, therefore, prove\r\n    uninteresting. At the outset, let the reader bear in mind that Sir\r\n    Reynard _Canadensis_ is rather a rakish, dissipated gentleman,\r\n    constantly turning night into day, in the habit of perambulating\r\n    through the forests, the fields, and homesteads, at most improper\r\n    hours, to ascertain whether, perchance, some old dame Partlett, some\r\n    hoary gobbler, some thoughtless mother-goose, allured to wander over\r\n    the farm-yard by the jocund rays of a returning March sun, may not\r\n    have been outside of the barn, when the negligent stable-boy closed up\r\n    for the night; or else, whether some gay Lothario of a hare in yonder\r\n    thicket may not, by the silent and discreet rays of the moon, be\r\n    whispering some soft nonsense in the willing ear of some guileless\r\n    doe, escaped from a parent's vigilant eye. For on such has the\r\n    midnight marauder set his heart: after such does noiselessly prowl,\r\n    favoured by darkness--the dissipated rascal--_querens quem devoret_--\r\n    determined to make up, on the morrow, by a long meridian _siesta_ on\r\n    the highest pinacle of a snow-drift, for the loss of his night's-rest.\r\n    Should fortune refuse the sly prowler the coveted hen, turkey, goose,\r\n    or hare, warmly clad in his fur coat and leggings, with tail\r\n    horizontal, he sallies forth over the snow-wreathed fields, on the\r\n    skirts of woods, in search of ground mice, his ordinary provender.\r\n    But, you will say, how can he discover them under the snow? By that\r\n    wonderful instinct with which nature has endowed the brute creation to\r\n    provide for their sustenance, each according to its nature, to its\r\n    wants. By his marvellously acute ear, the fox detects the ground mouse\r\n    under the snow, though he should utter a noise scarcely audible to a\r\n    human ear. Mr. Fox sets instantly to work, digs down the earth, and in\r\n    a trice gobbles up _mus_, his wife, and young family. Should nothing\r\n    occur to disturb his arrangements, he devotes each day in winter, from\r\n    ten or half-past ten in the forenoon, to repose; selecting the\r\n    loftiest snow-bank he can find, or else a large rock, or perchance any\r\n    other eminence from which--\r\n\r\n      \"Monarch of all _he surveys_\"--\r\n\r\n    he can command a good view of the neighborhod, and readily scent\r\n    approaching danger. Nor does he drop off immediately in a sound sleep,\r\n    like a turtle-fed alderman; but rather, like a suspicious, blood-\r\n    thirsty land pirate, as he is, he first snatches hastily \"forty\r\n    winks,\" then starts up nervously, for several times, scanning all\r\n    around with his cruel, cunning eye--snuffing the air. Should he be\r\n    satisfied that no cause of alarm exists, he scrapes himself a bed, if\r\n    in the snow and, warmly wrapped in his soft fur cloak, he coils\r\n    himself up, cat-fashion, in the sun, with his brushy tail brought over\r\n    his head, but careful to keep his nose to the direction from which the\r\n    wind blows, so as to catch the first notice of and scent the lurking\r\n    enemy. On a stormy, blustery day, the fox will, however, usually seek\r\n    the shelter of some bushes or trees, and on such occasion is usually\r\n    found under the _lee_ of some little wooded point, where, steeped\r\n    in sweetest sleep, he can at leisure dream of clucking hens, fat\r\n    turkeys, and tender leverets--sheltered from the storm, and still\r\n    having an uninterrupted view before him. The hunter, when bent on a\r\n    fox hunt, is careful to wear garments whose colour blends with the\r\n    prevailing hue of frosted nature: a white cotton _capot_, and\r\n    _capuchon_ to match, is slipped over his great coat; pants also\r\n    white--everything to harmonize with the snow; a pair of snow-shoes and\r\n    a short gun complete his equipment. Once arrived at the post where he\r\n    expects to meet reynard, he looks carefully about for signs of tracks,\r\n    and having discovered fresh ones, he follows them, keeping a very\r\n    sharp look-out. Should he perceive a fox, and that animal be not\r\n    asleep, it is then that he has need of all his wits and of all the\r\n    knowledge of the animal's habits he may possess. As previously stated,\r\n    the fox depends principally on his scent, to discover danger; but his\r\n    eye is also good, and to succeed in approaching within gun shot of him\r\n    in the open country, the gunner must watch every motion most\r\n    carefully, moving only when the animal's gaze is averted, and stopping\r\n    instantly the moment he looks towards him, no matter what position the\r\n    sportman's may be at that time. No matter how uncomfortable he may\r\n    feel; move he dare not, foot nor limb; the eye of the fox is on him,\r\n    and the least movement would betray him and alarm his watchful quarry.\r\n    It will be easily conceived that to succesfully carry out this\r\n    programme, it requires nerves of steel and a patience _à toute\r\n    épreuve_. It has been the good luck of one of our friends once to\r\n    approach thus a fox, within twenty feet, without his detecting him;\r\n    needless to say, it was done moving against the wind. Some few hunters\r\n    can so exactly imitate the cry of the ground mouse, as to bring the\r\n    fox to them, especially if he is very hungry; but it is not always\r\n    that this plan succeeds. The animal's ear is keen; the slightest\r\n    defect in the imitation betrays the trap, and away canters alarmed\r\n    reynard at railroad speed. Some sportsmen prefer to watch the fox, and\r\n    wait until he falls asleep which they know he will surely do, if not\r\n    disturbed, and then they can approach him easily enough against the\r\n    wind. It is not unusual for them to get within fifteen feet of the\r\n    animal, before the noise of their footsteps causes him to wake.--As\r\n    may readily be supposed in such cases, his awakening and death are\r\n    generally simultaneous.\r\n\r\n    It is a fact worthy of note, that the fox, if undisturbed, will every\r\n    day return to the same place to sleep, and about the same hour. These\r\n    animals are not as abundant as they were a few years back.\r\n\r\n    The extent of country travelled by a fox by moonlight, each night, is\r\n    very great. Not many years ago, a Quebec hunter [258] who is in the\r\n    habit of enjoying his daily walk at peep of day, informed the writer\r\n    that on many occasions he has seen the sly wanderer, on being\r\n    disturbed from the neighborhood of the tanneries in St. Vallier\r\n    street, hieing away at a gallop towards the Lorette and Charlesbourg\r\n    mountains, a distance of nine miles each way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CAPE ROUGE COTTAGE._\r\n\r\nWith its rear facing St. Augustin parish, eight miles from the city a\r\ncommodious dwelling graces the summit of the lofty cape or promontory,\r\nwhich terminates westward the elevated _plateau_, on the eastern extremity\r\nof which, Champlain, in 1608, raised the lily-spangled banner of the\r\nBourbons. Unquestionably the environs of Quebec are rich in scenery,\r\nrevelling one half of the year in rural loveliness, the other half\r\nenjoying that solid comfort, which successful enterprise, taste and free\r\ninstitutions communicate to whatever they touch; but no where, not even at\r\nSpencer Wood, or Woodfield, has nature lavished such beautiful landscapes,\r\nsuch enchanting views. Three centuries ago, Europeans had pitched here\r\ntheir tents, until the return of spring, attracted by the charms of the\r\nspot; three hundred years after that, a man of taste--to whom we may now\r\nwithout fear, give his due, as he is where neither praise nor censure can\r\nbe suspected,--an English merchant had selected this site for its rare\r\nattractiveness; here he resided for many summers. In 1833 he removed to\r\nSpencer Wood. We allude to the late Henry Atkinson, who was succeeded at\r\nthe Cap Rouge Cottage by William Atkinson, Esq., merchant of London,\r\nEngland. Mr. William Atkinson lived in affluence and happiness at Cap\r\nRouge, several years. There are yet at Quebec those who remember the kind-\r\nheartedness and hospitality of this English gentleman of the old school.\r\n\r\nGeo. Usborne, Esq., was the next occupant of the cottage. The estate\r\nconsisted formerly of close on one hundred acres of land, extending north\r\nacross the king's highway, with a river frontage of about twenty acres,\r\nthe lot on the south side of the road is laid out, one half in a park, the\r\nremainder in two or three fruit and flower gardens, divided by brick walls\r\nto trail vines and ripen fruit. It lies quite sheltered with a southerly\r\nexposure, bounded by the lofty, perpendicular river banks; the base, some\r\ntwo hundred feet below, skirted by a narrow road, washed by the waves of\r\nthe St. Lawrence. A magnificent avenue extends along the high bank under\r\nancient, ever-verdant pines, whose far outspreading branches, under the\r\ninfluence of winds, sigh a plaintive but soothing music, blending their\r\nsoft rustle to the roar of the Etchemin or the Chaudière rivers before\r\neasterly gales; how well Pickering has it:--\r\n\r\n  \"The overshadowing pines alone, through which I roam,\r\n    Their verdure keep, although it darker looks;\r\n  And hark! as it comes sighing through the grove,\r\n    The exhausted gale, a spirit there awakes\r\n  That wild and melancholy music makes.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the house verandah, the eye plunges westward down the high cape,\r\nfollowing the capricious windings of the Cap Rouge stream far to the\r\nnorth, or else scans the green uplands of St. Augustin, its white cottages\r\nrising in soft undulations as far as the sight can reach. Over the extreme\r\npoint of the southwestern cape hangs a fairy pavilion, like an eagle's\r\neyrie amongst alpine crags, just a degree more secure than that pensile\r\nold fir tree which you notice at your feet stretching over the chasm;\r\nbeneath you the majestic flood, Canada's pride, with a hundred merchantmen\r\nsleeping on its placid waters, and the orb of day dancing blithely over\r\nevery ripple. Oh! for a few hours to roam with those we love under these\r\nold pines, to listen to the voices of other years, and cull a fragrant\r\nwreath of those wild flowers which everywhere strew our path.\r\n\r\nIs there not enough of nature's charm around this sunny, truly Canadian\r\nhome? And how much of the precious metal would many an English duke give\r\nto possess, in his own famed isle, a site of such exquisite beauty? We\r\nconfess, we denizens of Quebec, we do feel proud of our Quebec scenery;\r\nnot that on comparison we think the less of other localities, but that on\r\nlooking round we get to think more of our own.\r\n\r\nCap Rouge, from it having been the location of Europeans, early in the\r\nsixteenth century, must claim the attention of every man of cultivated\r\nmind who takes a pleasure in scrutinizing the past, and in tracing the\r\nadvent on our shores of the various races of European descent, now\r\nidentified with this land of the West, yearning for the bright destinies\r\nthe future has in store.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Cape, on which the Cape Rouge Cottage now stands,\r\nJacques Cartier and Roberval wintered, the first in 1541-2; the second in\r\n1543-4. Recent discoveries have merely added to the interest which these\r\nhistorical incidents awaken. The new _Historical Picture of Quebec_,\r\npublished in 1834, thus alludes to these circumstances:--\r\n\r\n\"We now come to another highly interesting portion of local history. It\r\nhas been stated that the old historians were apparently ignorant of this\r\nlast voyage of Cartier. Some place the establishment of the fort at Cape\r\nBreton, and confound his proceedings with those of Roberval. The exact\r\nspot where Cartier passed his second winter in Canada is not mentioned in\r\nany publication that we have seen. The following is the description given\r\nof the station in Hakluyt: 'After which things the said captain went, with\r\ntwo of his boats, up the river, beyond Canada'--the promontory of Quebec\r\nis meant--'and the port of St. Croix, to view a haven and a small river\r\nwhich is about four leagues higher, which he found better and more\r\ncommodious to ride in, and lay his ships, than the former. * * * The said\r\nriver is small, not passing fifty paces broad, and ships drawing three\r\nfathoms water may enter in at full sea; and at low water there is nothing\r\nbut a channel of a foot deep or thereabouts. * * * The mouth of the river\r\nis towards the south, and it windeth northward like a snake; and at the\r\nmouth of it, towards the east, there is a high and steep cliff, where we\r\nmade a way in manner of a pair of stairs, and aloft we made a fort to keep\r\nthe nether fort and the ships, and all things that might pass as well by\r\nthe great as by the small river.\" Who that reads the above accurate\r\ndescription will doubt that the mouth of the little river Cap Rouge was\r\nthe station chosen by Jacques Cartier for his second wintering place in\r\nCanada? The original description of the grounds and scenery on both sides\r\nof the river Cap Rouge is equally faithful with that which we have\r\nextracted above. The precise spot on which the upper fort of Jacques\r\nCartier was built, afterwards enlarged by Roberval, has been fixed by an\r\ningenious gentleman of Quebec, at the top of Cap Rouge height, a short\r\ndistance from the handsome villa and establishment of H. Atkinson (now of\r\nJames Bowen) There is, at the distance of about an acre to the north of\r\nMr. Atkinson's house, a hillock of artificial construction, upon which are\r\ntrees indicating great antiquity, and as it does not appear that any\r\nfortifications were erected on this spot, either in the war of 1759, or\r\nduring the attack of Quebec by the Americans in 1775, it is extremely\r\nprobable that here are to be found the interesting site and remains of the\r\nancient fort in question.\r\n\r\n\"On his return to the fort of Charlesbourg Royal, the suspicions of\r\nCartier as to the unfriendly disposition of the Indians were confirmed. He\r\nwas informed that the natives now kept aloof from the fort, and had ceased\r\nto bring them fish and provisions as before. He also learned from some of\r\nthe men who had been at Stadacona, that an unusual number of Indians had\r\nassembled there--and associating, as he always seems to have done, the\r\nidea of danger with any concourse of the natives, he resolved to take all\r\nnecessary precautions, causing everything in the fortress to be set in\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\"At this crisis, to the regret of all who feel an interest in the local\r\nhistory of the time the relation of Cartier's third voyage abruptly breaks\r\noff. Of the proceedings during the winter which he spent at Cap Rouge,\r\nnothing is known. It is probable that it passed over without any collision\r\nwith the natives, although the position of the French, from their\r\nnumerical weakness, must have been attended with great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"It has been seen that Roberval, notwithstanding his lofty titles, and\r\nreally enterprising character, did not fulfil his engagement to follow\r\nCartier with supplies sufficient for the settlement of a colony, until the\r\nyear following. By that time the Lieutenant General had furnished three\r\nlarge vessels chiefly at the King's cost, having on board two hundred\r\npersons, several gentlemen of quality, and settlers, both men and women.\r\nHe sailed from La Rochelle on the 16th of April, 1542, under the direction\r\nof an experienced pilot, by name John Alphonse, of Xaintonge. The\r\nprevalence of westerly winds prevented their reaching Newfoundland until\r\n7th June. On the 8th they entered the road of St. John, where they found\r\nseventeen vessels engaged in the fisheries. During his stay in this road,\r\nhe was surprised and disappointed by the appearance of Jacques Cartier, on\r\nhis return from Canada, whither he had been sent the year before with five\r\nships. Cartier had passed the winter in the fortress described above, and\r\ngave as a reason for the abandonment of the settlement, 'that he could not\r\nwith his small company withstand the savages which went about daily to\r\nannoy him.' He continued, nevertheless, to speak of the country as very\r\nrich and fruitful. Cartier is said, in the relation, of Roberval's voyage\r\nin Hakluyt, to have produced some gold ore found in the country, which on\r\nbeing tried in a furnace, proved to be good. He had with him also some\r\n_diamonds_, the natural production of the promontory of Quebec, from\r\nwhich the Cape derived its name. The Lieutenant General having brought so\r\nstrong a reinforcement of men and necessaries for the settlement, was\r\nextremely urgent with Cartier to go back again to Cap Rouge, but without\r\nsuccess. It is most probable that the French, who had recently passed a\r\nwinter of hardship in Canada, would not permit their Captain to attach\r\nhimself to the fortunes and particular views of Roberval. Perhaps, the\r\nfond regret of home prevailed over the love of adventure, and like men who\r\nconceived that they had performed their part of the contract into which\r\nthey had entered, they were not disposed to encounter new hardships under\r\na new leader. In order, therefore, to prevent any open disagreement,\r\nCartier weighed anchor in the course of the night without taking leave of\r\nRoberval, and made all sail for France. It is impossible not to regret\r\nthis somewhat inglorious termination of a distinguished career. Had he\r\nreturned to his fort, with the additional strength of Roberval, guided by\r\nhis own skill and experience, it is most probable that the colony would\r\nhave been destined to a permanent existence. Cartier undertook no other\r\nvoyage to Canada; but he afterwards completed a sea chart, drawn by his\r\nown hand, which was extant in the possession of one of his nephews,\r\nJacques Noël, of St. Malo, in 1587, who seems to have taken great interest\r\nin the further development of the vast country discovered by his deceased\r\nuncle. Two letters of his have been preserved, relating to the maps and\r\nwritings of Cartier: the first written in 1587, and the others a year or\r\ntwo latter, in which he mentions that his two sons, Michael and John Noël,\r\nwere then in Canada, and that he was in expectation of their return.\r\nCartier himself died soon after his return to France, having sacrificed\r\nhis fortune in the case of discovery. As an indemnification for the losses\r\ntheir uncle had sustained, this Jacques Noel and another nephew, De la\r\nLaunay Chaton, received in 1588, an exclusive privilege to trade to Canada\r\nduring, twelve years, but this was revoked four months after it was\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\n\"Roberval, notwithstanding his mortification at the loss of Cartier's\r\nexperience and aid in his undertaking, determined to proceed, and sailing\r\nfrom Newfoundland, about the end of June, 1543, he arrived at Cap Rouge,\r\n'four leagues westward of the Isle of Orleans,' towards the end of July.\r\nHere the French immediately fortified themselves, 'in a place fit to\r\ncommand the main river, and of strong situation against all manner of\r\nenemies.' The position was, no doubt, that chosen by Jacques Cartier the\r\nyear previous. The following is the description given in Hakluyt of the\r\nbuildings erected by Roberval: 'The said General on his first arrival\r\nbuilt a fair fort, near and somewhat westward above Canada, which is very\r\nbeautiful to behold, and of great force, situated upon a high mountain,\r\nwherein there were two courts of buildings, a great tower, and another of\r\nforty or fifty feet long, wherein there were divers chambers, a hall, a\r\nkitchen, cellars high and low, and near unto it were an oven and mills,\r\nand a stove to warm men in, and a well before the house. And the building\r\nwas situated upon the great River of Canada called _France-Prime_ by\r\nMonsieur Roberval. There was also at the foot of the mountain another\r\nlodging, where at the first all our victuals, and whatsoever was brought\r\nwith us, were sent to be kept, and near unto that tower there is another\r\nsmall river. In these two places above and beneath, all the meaner sort\r\nwas lodged.' This fort was called _France-Roy_, but of these extensive\r\nbuildings, erected most probably in a hasty and inartificial manner, no\r\ntraces now remain, unless we consider as such the mound above mentioned,\r\nnear the residence of Mr. Atkinson, at Cap Rouge.\r\n\r\n\"On the 14th September, Roberval sent back to France two of his vessels,\r\nwith two gentlemen, bearers of letters to the King; who had instructions\r\nto return the following year with supplies for the settlement. The natives\r\ndo not appear, by the relation given, to have evinced any hostility to the\r\nnew settlers. Unfortunately, the scurvy again made its appearance among\r\nthe French and carried off no less than sixty during the winter. The\r\nmorality of this little colony was not very rigid--perhaps they were\r\npressed by hunger, and induced to plunder from each other--at all events\r\nthe severity of the Viceroy towards his handful of subjects appears not to\r\nhave been restricted to the male sex. The method adopted by the Governor\r\nto secure a quiet life will raise a smile; 'Monsieur Roberval used very\r\ngood justice, and punished every man according to his offence. One whose\r\nname was Michael Gaillon, was hanged for his theft. John of Nantes was\r\nlaid in irons, and kept prisoner for his offence; and others also were put\r\nin irons, and divers whipped, as well men as women, by which means they\r\nlived quiet.'\r\n\r\n\"We have no record extant of the other proceedings of Roberval during the\r\nwinter of 1543. The ice broke up in the month of April; and on the 5th\r\nJune, the Lieutenant General departed from the winter quarters on an\r\nexploring expedition to the Province of Saguenay, as Cartier had done on a\r\nformer occasion. Thirty persons were left behind in the fort under the\r\ncommand of an officer, with instructions to return to France, if he had\r\nnot returned by the 1st of July. There are no particulars of this\r\nexpedition, on which, however, Roberval employed a considerable time. For\r\nwe find that on the 14th June, four of the gentlemen belonging to the\r\nexpedition returned to the fort, having left Roberval on the way to\r\nSaguenay; and on the 19th, some others came back, bringing with them some\r\nsix score weight of Indian corn; and directions for the rest to wait for\r\nthe return of the Viceroy, until the 22nd July. An incident happened in\r\nthis expedition, which seems to have escaped the notice of the author of\r\nthe treaties on the _canon de bronze_ (Amable Barthelot), which we\r\nhave noticed in a former chapter. It certainly gives an authentic account\r\nof a ship wreck having been suffered in the St. Lawrence, to which,\r\nperhaps, the finding of the cannon, and the tradition about Jacques\r\nCartier, may with some possibility be referred. The following is the\r\nextract in question: 'Eight men and one bark drowned and lost, among whom\r\nwere Monsieur de Noire Fontaine, and one named La Vasseur of Constance.'\r\nThe error as to the name might easily arise, Jacques Cartier having been\r\nthere so short a time before, and his celebrity in the country being so\r\nmuch greater than that of Roberval, or of any of his companions.\"\r\n\r\nCap Rouge Cottage is now owned by James Bowen, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n_BEAUSÉJOUR._\r\n\r\n  Flooded in sunny silence sleep the kine,\r\n    In languid murmurs brooklets float and flow,\r\n  The quaint farm-gables in rich light shine\r\n  And round them jasmined honeysuckles twine,\r\n    And close beside them sun-flowers burn and blow.\r\n\r\nAbout one mile beyond the St. Foye Church, there is a fertile farm of one,\r\nhundred acres, lying chiefly on the north side of the road. The dwelling,\r\na roomy, one story cottage, stands about two acres from the highway, from\r\nwhich a copse of trees interrupts the view.\r\n\r\nThere are at present in this spot, several embellishments--such as trout\r\nponds--which bid fair to render it worthy of the notice of men of taste.\r\nIt was merely necessary to assist nature in order to obtain here most\r\ngratifying results. Between the road fence and the dwelling, a small brook\r\nhas worn its bed, at the bottom of a deep ravine, sweeping past the house\r\nlawn westward, and then changing its course to due north-west the boundary\r\nin that direction between that and the adjoining property. The banks of\r\nthe ravine are enclosed in a belt of every imaginable forest shrub,--wild\r\ncherry, mountain ash, raspberry, blueberry, interspersed here and there\r\nwith superb specimens of oak, spruce, fir and pine. A second avenue has\r\nbeen laid out amongst the trees between the road fence and the brook, to\r\nconnect with the lawn at the west of the house, by a neat little bridge,\r\nresting on two square piers about twenty-five feet high: on either side of\r\nthe bridge a solid dam being constructed of the boulders and stones\r\nremoved from the lower portion of the property, intended to form two trout\r\nponds of a couple of acres in length each, a passage in the dam is left\r\nfor the water-fall, which is in full view of the bridge. On the edge of\r\nthe bank, overhanging the ravine, nature seems to have pointed out the\r\nspot for a pavilion, from which the disciples of Isaac Walton can throw a\r\ncast below. The green fringe of the mountain shrubs in bud, blossom or\r\nfruit, encircling the farm, materially enhances the beauty of this sylvan\r\nlandscape,--the eye resting with particular pleasure on the vast expanse\r\nof meadow of vivid green, clothed in most luxuriant grass, some 10,000\r\nbundles of hay for the mower, in due time. About two acres from the house,\r\nto the west, is placed a rustic seat, under two weather-beaten, though\r\nstill verdant oaks, which stretch their boughs across the river: closer\r\nagain to the cottage, the eye meets two pavilions. The new avenue, rustic\r\nbridges, ponds and pavilions, are due to the good taste of the present\r\nowner, Louis Bilodeau, Esq. This rural home was for several years occupied\r\nin summer by Stephen Sewell, Esq., and does not belie its name--\r\nBeauséjour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_BELMONT._\r\n\r\n    Owners--Intendant Talon, 1670; General James Murray, 1765; Sir John\r\n    Caldwell, 1810; J. W. Dunscomb. Esquire, 1854-81.\r\n\r\nThat genial old joker, Sir Jonas Barrington, in his _Sketches_, has\r\ninvested the Irish homes and Irish gentry with features certainly very\r\noriginal--at times so singular as to be difficult of acceptance. True, he\r\nlived in an age and amongst a people proverbial for generous hospitality,\r\nfor conviviality carried to its extreme limit. Gargantuan banquets he\r\ndescribes, pending which the bowls of punch and claret imbibed appear to\r\nus something fabulous. Irish squires, roystering Irish barristers,\r\ntoddling home in pairs after having stowed away under their belts as many\r\nas twelve bottles of claret a piece, during a prolonged sitting, _i.e._,\r\nfrom 6 P.M. to 6 A.M. Such intrepid diners-out were known as \"Twelve\r\nbottle men;\" and verily, if the old Judge is to be credited, they might\r\nhave been advantageously pitted even against such a Homeric guzzler as\r\nhistory depicts Aurora Konigsmark's sturdy son, Maréchal de Saxe, who, in\r\nhis youth, 'tis said, tossed off, at one draught and without experiencing\r\nany ill-effects, one whole gallon of wine.\r\n\r\nThe first time our eye scanned the silent and deserted banquetting halls\r\nof Belmont, with their lofty ceilings, and recalling the traditional\r\naccounts of the hospitable gentlemen, whose joviality had once lit up the\r\nscene, visions of social Ireland of Barrington's day floated uppermost in\r\nour mind. We could fancy we saw the gay roysterers of times by-gone--first\r\na fête champêtre of lively French officers from Quebec, making merry over\r\ntheir Bordeaux or Burgundy, and celebrating the news of their recent\r\nvictories at Fontenoy, [259] Lauffeld or Carillon, to the jocund sound of\r\n_Vive la France! Vive le Maréchal de Saxe! à la Claire Fontaine_, &c\r\nthen Governor Murray, surrounded by his veterans, Guy Carleton, Col.\r\nCaldwell, Majors Hale, Holland, and some of the new subjects, such as the\r\nbrave Chs. De Lanaudière, [260] complimenting one another all around over\r\nthe feats of the respective armies at the two memorable battles of the\r\nPlains, and all joining loyally in repeating the favorite toast in Wolfe's\r\nfleet, _British colours on every French fort, port and garrison in\r\nAmerica_! Later on, at the beginning of the present century, a gathering\r\nof those Canadian Barons, so graphically delineated by John Lambert in his\r\n_Travels in Canada_, in 1808--one week surrounding the festive board of\r\nthis jolly Receiver General of Canada at Belmont, the next at\r\nCharlesbourg, making the romantic echoes of the Hermitage ring again with\r\nold English cheers and loyal toasts to \"George the King,\" or else\r\ninstalling a \"Baron\" at the Union Hotel, Place d'Armes,--possibly in\r\nthe very Council-room in which the State secrets of Canada were in 1865\r\ndaily canvassed--and flinging down to the landlord as Lambert says, \"250\r\nguineas for the entertainement.\" Where are now the choice spirits of that\r\ncomparatively modern day, the rank and fashion who used to go and sip\r\nclaret or eat ice-cream with Sir James Craig, at Powell Place? Where gone\r\nthe Mures, Paynters, Munros, Matthew Bells, de Lanaudières, Lymburners,\r\nSmiths, Finlays, Caldwells, Percevals, Jonathan Sewells? Alas! like the\r\nglories of Belmont, departed, or living in the realms of memory only!\r\n\r\nThis estate, which, until lately, consisted of four hundred and fifty\r\nacres, extending from the line of the Grande Allée down to the Bijou wood,\r\nwas _conceded_ in 1649 by the Jesuit Fathers to M. Godfroy. It passed\r\nover, in 1670, to the celebrated Intendant Talon, by deed of sale executed\r\non the 28th of September, 1670, before Romain Becquet, Notaire Royal.\r\nMessire Jean Talon is described in that instrument as \"Conseiller du roi\r\nen ses conseils d'état et premier Intendant de justice, police et finance\r\nde la Nouvelle France, Isle de Terreneuve, Acadie et pays de l'Amérique\r\nSeptentrionale.\" Shortly after the conquest it was occupied by Chief\r\nJustice Wm. Gregory. In 1765 it was sold for £500 by David Alves of\r\nMontreal, to General James Murray, who, after the first battle of the\r\nPlains, had remained Governor of Quebec, whilst his immediate superior,\r\nBrigadier Geo. Townshend, had hurried to England to cull the laurels of\r\nvictory. In 1775, we find that one of the first operations of the American\r\nGeneral Montgomery was to take possession of \"General Murray's house, on\r\nthe St. Foy road.\" General Murray also, probably, then owned the property\r\nsubsequently known as Holland's farm, where Montgomery had his\r\nheadquarters. All through our history the incidents, actors and results of\r\nbattles are tolerably well indicated, but the domestic history of\r\nindividuals and exact descriptions of localities are scarcely ever\r\nfurnished, so that the reader will not be surprised should several\r\n_lacunae_ occur in the description of Belmont, one of the most interesting\r\nCanadian country seats in the neighbourhood of Quebec. The history of\r\nHolland House might also, of itself, furnish quite a small epic; and,\r\ndoubtless, from the exalted social position of many of the past owners of\r\nBelmont, its old walls, could they obtain utterance, might reveal\r\ninteresting incidents of our past history, which will otherwise ever be\r\nburied in oblivion.\r\n\r\nIn the memory of Quebecers, Belmont must always remain more particularly\r\nconnected with the name of the Caldwells, three generations of whom\r\noccupied its spacious halls. The founder of this old family, who played a\r\nconspicuous part in Canadian politics for half a century, was the Hon.\r\nCol. Henry Caldwell, for many years Receiver General of the Province, by\r\nroyal appointment, and member of the Legislative Council. He came first to\r\nCanada in 1759, says Knox, [261] as Assistant Quartermaster General to\r\nWolfe, under whom he served. When appointed Receiver General, the salary\r\nattached to that high office [262] was £400 per annum, with the\r\nunderstanding that he might _account_ at his convenience, he never\r\naccounted at all, probably as it was anything but _convenient_ to do\r\nso, having followed the traditional policy of high officials under French\r\nrule, and speculated largely in milk, &c. The fault was more the\r\nconsequences of the system than that of the individual, and had his\r\nventures turned out well, no doubt the high-minded Colonel and Receiver\r\nGeneral would have made matters right before dying. In 1801 Col. Caldwell\r\nwas returned member for Dorchester, where he owned the rich Seigniory of\r\nLauzon, and most extensive mill at the Etchemin river, the same\r\nsubsequently owned by J. Thomson, Esq., and now by Hy. Atkinson, Esq. The\r\ncolonel was re-elected by the same constituency in 1805, and again in\r\n1809, lived in splendor at Belmont, as a polished gentleman of that age\r\nknew how to live, and died there in 1810. Belmont is situated on the St.\r\nFoye road, on its north side, at the end of a long avenue of trees,\r\ndistant three miles from Quebec. The original mansion, which was burnt\r\ndown in 1798, was rebuilt by the Colonel in 1800 on plans furnished by an\r\nEngineer Officer of the name of Brabazon. It stood in the garden between\r\nthe present house and main or St. Foye road. The cellar forms the spacious\r\nroot house, at present in the garden. Col Caldwell's exquisite\r\nentertainments soon drew around his table some of the best men of Quebec,\r\nof the time, such as the gallant Gen. Brock, John Colt man, William\r\nColtman, the Hales, Foy, Haldimand, Dr. Beeby of Powell Place, J. Lester,\r\nJohn Blackwood. In 1810 Mr. John Caldwell, son of the Colonel, accepted\r\nthe succession with its liabilities, not then known. He however made the\r\nLauzon manor his residence in summer, and was also appointed Receiver\r\nGeneral. In 1817 Belmont was sold to the Hon. J. Irvine, M.P.P., the\r\ngrandfather of the present member for Megantic, Hon. George J. Irvine.\r\nHon. Mr. Irvine resided there until 1833. The beautiful row of trees which\r\nline the house avenue and other embellishments, are due to his good taste.\r\nIn 1838 the property reverted to the late Sir Henry Caldwell, the son of\r\nSir John Caldwell, who in 1827, had inherited the title by the death of an\r\nIrish relative, Sir James Caldwell, the third Baronet (who was made a\r\nCount of Milan by the Empress Maria Theresa, descended by his mothers'\r\nside from the 20th Lord Kerry). John Caldwell of Lauzon, having become Sir\r\nJohn Caldwell, _menait un grain train_, as the old peasants of Etchemin\r\nrepeat to this day. His house, stud and amusements were those of a baron\r\nof old, and of a hospitable Irish gentleman, spreading money and progress\r\nover the length and breadth of the land. At his death, which happened at\r\nBoston in 1842, the insignificant Etchemin settlement, through his\r\nefforts, had materially increased in wealth, size and population. There\r\nwas, however, at his demise, an _error_ in his Government balance sheet of\r\n£100,000 on the wrong side!\r\n\r\nBelmont lines the St. Foye heights, in a most picturesque situation. The\r\nview from the east and north-western windows is magnificently grand;\r\nprobably one might count more than a dozen church spires glittering in the\r\ndistance--peeping out of every happy village which dots the base of the\r\nblue mountains to the north. In 1854 this fine property was purchased by\r\nJ. W. Dunscomb, Esq., Collector of Customs, Quebec, who resided there\r\nseveral years, and sold the garden for a cemetery to the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch authorities of Quebec, reserving 400 acres for himself. The old\r\nhouse, within a few years, was purchased by Mr. Wakeham, the late manager\r\nof the Beauport Asylum. His successful treatment of diseases of the mind\r\ninduced him to open, at this healthy and secluded spot, under the name of\r\nthe \"Belmont Retreat,\" a private _Maison de Santé_, where, wealthy\r\npatients are treated with that delicate care which they could not expect\r\nin a crowded asylum. The same success has attended Mr. Wakeham's\r\nenterprise at Belmont which crowned it at Beauport.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _AN IRISH EDUCATION IN THE OLDEN TIMES._\r\n\r\n    Among the old stories handed down in Canadian homes\r\n\r\n      \"In the long nights of winter,\r\n      When the cold north winds blow,\"\r\n\r\n    of the merry gatherings and copious feasts of other days, one is told\r\n    of a memorable entertainment at Belmont, given a crowd of friends.\r\n\r\n    Some assert it was the Belmont anniversary dinner of the battle of\r\n    Waterloo and bring in of course Blucher, Hougomont! Belle-Alliance and\r\n    what not. It is, however, more generally believed among the aged,\r\n    judging from the copious libations and kindly toasts drank, that it\r\n    partook of a more intimate character and was merely a _fête de\r\n    famille_, to commemorate the safe return of sir John Caldwell's\r\n    only son from Ireland, where he had just completed his collegiate\r\n    course at Dublin, be that as it may, it unquestionably was meant to\r\n    solemnise an important family or national event.\r\n\r\n    As was wont, in those hospitable times, the \"landlord's flowing bowl,\"\r\n    alas! had been emptied too often. Some of the \"Barons of the round\r\n    table\" were in fact preparing for a timely retreat, before the city\r\n    gates should be closed, [263] the genial host soon put a stop to such\r\n    a treasonable practice, exclaiming that the sentry would let them pass\r\n    at any hour, so they need only follow the Commandant, their fellow\r\n    guest, who of course had the countersign, closing his well timed\r\n    remarks, by raising his voice and proclaiming in an authoritative tone\r\n    \"no heel taps here,\" the stately banquet hall re-echoed with cheers \"a\r\n    bumper, a bumper,\" resounded on all sides, \"to the future Sir Harry,\r\n    who has just completed his Irish education.\" The future Sir Harry was\r\n    soon on his legs, and in a voice mellow with old port, youth and fun,\r\n    responded \"Friends, fellow countrymen, brothers, (this last expression\r\n    was challenged as he was an only son) I am indeed proud of my Dublin\r\n    education, we have something, however better before us than a\r\n    disquisition on the excellence of the various systems of continental\r\n    courses, to be brief, I now challenge any here present to meet me on\r\n    the classics, astronomy, the cubic root or glass to glass, you have\r\n    your choice.\" \"Glass to glass,\" they one and all replied. Toasts,\r\n    songs, healths of every member of the Royal family, were gone through\r\n    with amazing zest as time advanced towards the small hours of the\r\n    morning, the guests, one by one disappeared from the banqueting room,\r\n    some, alas! under the mahogany, more with the genial commander of the\r\n    garrison, whilst the stalwart Irish student, still undaunted and\r\n    meeting the foe, glass to glass--a veritable giant, fresher as he went\r\n    on.\r\n\r\n    Old Sir John, a well seasoned diner-out, at last found himself\r\n    solitary at his end of the table, whilst his son adorned the other end\r\n    defiantly.\r\n\r\n    Looking round in dismay and fearing, if he continued the healths, to\r\n    be unequal to cope with such an intrepid Dublin student, he the last\r\n    gave up, flinging himself majestically back in his chair, exclaiming\r\n    \"D----n your Irish education!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_HOLLAND FARM._\r\n\r\nThis estate, which formerly comprised two hundred acres of ground,\r\nextending from the brow of the St. Foye heights to St Michael's Chapel on\r\nthe Samoa or St. Lewis road, possesses considerable interest for the\r\nstudent of Canadian history, both under French and English rule. The\r\noriginal dwelling, a long high-peaked French structure, stood on an\r\neminence closer to the St. Foye road than does the present house. It was\r\nbuilt about the year 1740, by a rich Lower Town merchant, Monsieur Jean\r\nTaché [264] who resided there after his marriage in 1742 with Mademoiselle\r\nMarie Anne Jolliet de Mingan, grand-daughter to the celebrated discoverer\r\nof the Mississippi, Louis Jolliet. Monsieur Jean Taché was also _Syndic\r\ndes Marchands_, member of the Supreme Council of Quebec, and ancestor\r\nto Sir. E. P. Taché. He at one time owned several vessels, but his\r\nfloating wealth having, during the war of the conquest, become the prize\r\nof English cruisers, the St. Peter street Nabob of 1740, as it has since\r\nhappened to some of his successors in that _romantic_ neighbourhood,\r\n--lost his money. Loss of fortune did not, however, imply loss of honour,\r\nas old memoirs of that day describe him, \"Homme intègre et d'esprit.\" He\r\nhad been selected, in the last year of French rule, to go and lay at the\r\nfoot of the French Throne the grievances of the Canadians. About this\r\ntime, the St. Foye road was becoming a fashionable resort, _Hawkin's\r\nPicture of Quebec_ calls it \"The favorite drive of the Canadian Belle\r\nbefore the conquest.\" This is an interesting period in colonial life, but\r\nimperfectly known,--nor will a passage from Jeffery, an old and valued\r\nEnglish writer, illustrative of men, manners and amusements in the Colony,\r\nwhen it passed over to the English monarch, be out of place:--\r\n\r\n\"The number of inhabitants being considerably increased, they pass their\r\ntime very agreeably. The Governor General, with his household; several of\r\nthe _noblesse_ of exceeding good families; the officers of the army,\r\nwho in France are all gentlemen; the Intendant, with a Supreme Council,\r\nand the inferior magistrates; the Commissary of the Marine; the Grand\r\nProvost; the Grand Hunter; the Grand Master of the Woods and Forests, who\r\nhas the most extensive jurisdiction in the world; rich merchants, or such\r\nas live as if they were so; the bishops and a numerous Seminary; two\r\ncolleges of Récollets, as many of Jesuits; with three Nunneries; amongst\r\nall those yon are at no loss to find agreeable company and the most\r\nentertaining conversation. Add to this the diversions of the place, such\r\nas the assemblies at the Lady Governess's and Lady Intendant's; parties at\r\ncards, or of pleasure, such as in the winter on the ice, in sledges, or in\r\nskating; and in the summer in chaises or canoes; also hunting, which it is\r\nimpossible not to be fond of in a country abounding with plenty of game of\r\nall kinds.\r\n\r\n\"It is remarked of the Canadians that their conversation is enlivened by\r\nan air of freedom which is natural and peculiar to them, and that they\r\nspeak the French in the greatest purity and without the least false\r\naccent. There are few rich people in that Colony, though they all live\r\nwell, are extremely generous and hospitable, keep very good tables, and\r\nlove to dress very finely.... The Canadians have carried the love of arms,\r\nand glory, so natural to their mother country, along with them.... War is\r\nnot only welcome to them but coveted with extreme ardor.\" [265]\r\n\r\nDuring the fall of 1775, the old mansion sheltered Brigadier Richard\r\nMontgomery, [266] the leader of the American forlorn hope, who fell on the\r\n31st December of that year, at Près-de-Ville, Champlain street, fighting\r\nagainst those same British whom it had previously been his pride to lead\r\nto victory. About the year 1780, we find this residence tenanted by a\r\nworthy British officer, who had been a great favourite with the hero of\r\nthe Plains of Abraham. Major Samuel Holland had fought bravely that day\r\nunder General Wolfe, and stood, it is said, after the battle, close by the\r\nexpiring warrior. His dwelling took the name of Holland House: he added to\r\nit, a cupola, which served in lieu of a _prospect tower_, wherefrom\r\ncould be had a most extensive view of the surrounding country. [267] The\r\nimportant appointment of Surveyor General of the Province, which was\r\nbestowed on Major Holland, together with his social qualities, abilities\r\nand education, soon gathered round him the _élite_ of the English\r\nSociety in Quebec at that time. Amongst the distinguished guests who\r\nfrequented Holland House in 1791, we find Edward, afterwards Duke of Kent.\r\nThe numerous letters still extant addressed by His Royal Highness from\r\nKensington Palace, as late as 1814, to the many warm friends he had left\r\non the banks of the St. Lawrence, contain pleasant reminiscences of his\r\nsojourn amongst his royal father's Canadian lieges. Amongst other\r\nfrequenters of Holland House, may also be noted a handsome stranger, who\r\nafter attending--the gayest of the gay--the Quebec Château balls,\r\nRegimental mess dinners, Barons' Club, tandem drives, as the male friend\r\nof one of the young Hollands was, to the amazement of all, convicted at a\r\nmess dinner of being a lady [268] in disguise. A _fracas_ of course\r\nensued. The lady-like guest soon vamosed to England, where _he_ became the\r\nlawful spouse of the Hon. Mr. C----, the brother to Lord F----d. One\r\nremnant of the Hollands long endured; the old fir tree on that portion of\r\nthe property purchased by James Creighton, farmer. Holland tree was still\r\nsacred to the memory of the five slumberers, who have reposed for more\r\nthan a century beneath its hoary branches. Nor has the recollection of the\r\n\"fatal duel\" faded away. Holland farm, for many years, belonged to Mr.\r\nWilson of the Customs Department, Quebec, in 1843 it passed by purchase to\r\nJudge George Okill Stuart, of Québec; Mr. Stuart improved the place,\r\nremoved the old house and built a handsome new one on a rising ground in\r\nrear, which he occupied for several summers. It again became renowned for\r\ngaiety and festivity when subsequently owned by Robert Cassels, Esquire,\r\nfor many years Manager of the Bank of British North America at Quebec.\r\nGenl. Danl. Lysons had leased it in 1862, for his residence, when the\r\nunexpected vote of the House of Assembly on the Militia Bill broke through\r\nhis arrangements. Holland House is still the property of Mr. Cassels.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THE HOLLAND TREE._\r\n\r\n    (BY THE AUTHOR OF \"MAPLE LEAVES\")\r\n\r\n      \"Woodman spare that tree.\"\r\n\r\n    It has often been noticed that one of the chief glories of Quebec\r\n    consisted in being surrounded on all sides by smiling country seats,\r\n    which in the summer season, as it were, encircle the brow of the old\r\n    city like a chaplet of flowers; those who, on a sunny June morning,\r\n    have wandered through the shady groves of Spencer Wood, Woodfield,\r\n    Marchmont, Benmore, Kilmarnock, Kirk Ella, Hamwood, Beauvoir,\r\n    Clermont, and fifty other old places, rendered vocal by the voices of\r\n    birds, and with the sparkling waters of the great river or the winding\r\n    St. Charles at their feet, are not likely to gainsay this statement.\r\n\r\n    Amongst these beautiful rural retreats few are better known than\r\n    Holland Farm, in 1780 the family mansion of Surveyor-General Holland,\r\n    one of Wolfe's favourite engineer officers. During the fall of 1775 it\r\n    had been the headquarters of Brig. General Montgomery, who chose it as\r\n    his residence during the siege of Quebec, whilst his colleague, Col.\r\n    Benedict Arnold, was stationed with his New Englanders at the house\r\n    southeast of Scott's Bridge, on the Little River road, for many years\r\n    the homestead of Mr. Langlois. This fine property, running back as far\r\n    as Mount Hermon Cemetery, and extending from the St. Louis or Grand\r\n    Allée road, opposite Spencer Wood, down to the St. Foye road, which it\r\n    crosses, is bounded to the north by the _cime du cap_, or St. Foye\r\n    heights. For those who may be curious to know its original extent to\r\n    an eighth of an inch, I shall quote from Major Holland's title-deed,\r\n    wherein it is stated to comprise \"in superficies, French measure, two\r\n    hundred and six arpents, one perch, seven feet eight inches, and _four\r\n    eighths of an inch_,\" from which description one would infer the Major\r\n    had surveyed his domain with great minuteness, or that he must have\r\n    been rather a stickler for territorial rights. What would his shades\r\n    now think could they be made cognizant of the fact that that very\r\n    château garden, [269] which he possessed and bequeathed to his sons in\r\n    the year 1800, which had been taken possession of for military\r\n    purposes by the Imperial authorities, is held by them to this day?\r\n    Major Samuel Holland had distinguished himself as an officer under\r\n    General Wolfe, on the Plains of Abraham, lived at Holland House [270]\r\n    many years, as was customary in those days, in affluence, and at last\r\n    paid the common debt to nature. He had been employed in Prince Edward\r\n    Island and Western Canada on public surveys.\r\n\r\n    The Major, after having provided for his wife, Mary Josette Rolet,\r\n    bequeathed his property to Frederick Braham, John Frederick,\r\n    Charlotte, Susan and George Holland, [271] his children. In 1817,\r\n    Frederick Braham Holland, who at that time was an ordnance storekeeper\r\n    at Prince Edward Island, sold his share of the farm to the late\r\n    William Wilson, of the Customs. Ten years later, John Frederick and\r\n    Charlotte Holland also disposed of their interest in this land to Mr.\r\n    Wilson, who subsequently, having acquired the rights of another heir,\r\n    viz., in 1835, remained proprietor of Holland Farm until 1843, when\r\n    the property by purchase passed over to Judge Geo. Okill Stuart, of\r\n    this city. Mr. Stuart built on it a handsome mansion now known as\r\n    Holland House, which he subsequently sold to Rob. Cassells, Esq., of\r\n    Quebec, late manager of the Bank of British North America.\r\n\r\n    Holland Farm has been gradually dismembered: Coulonge Cottage, at the\r\n    outlet of the Gomin Road, [272] is built on Holland farm. A successful\r\n    gold digger by the name of Sinjohn purchased in the year 1862 a large\r\n    tract of the farm fronting the St. Louis road with Thornhill as its\r\n    north eastern and Mr. Stuart's new road as its south-western boundary.\r\n    His cottage is shaded by the Thornhill Grove, with a garden and lawn\r\n    and adjoins a level pasturage entirely denuded of shrubs and forest\r\n    trees. [273] To a person looking from the main gate, at Spencer Wood\r\n    in the direction of the south gable of Holland House, exactly in a\r\n    straight line, no object intervenes except a fir tree which detaches\r\n    itself on the horizon, conspicuous from afar over the plantation which\r\n    fronts the St. Foye road. That tree is the Holland Tree. Well! what\r\n    about the Holland Tree? What! you a Quebecer and not to know about the\r\n    Holland Tree? the duel and the slumberers who have reposed for so many\r\n    years under its shade!\r\n\r\n    Oh! but suppose I am not a Quebecer. Tell me about the Holland Tree.\r\n    Well, walk down from the St. Louis road along Mr. Stuart's new road\r\n    and we shall see first how the rest of the 'slumberers' has been\r\n    respected. Hear the words which filial affection dictated to Frederick\r\n    Braham, John Frederick and Charlotte Holland, when on the 14th July\r\n    1827, they executed a deed [274] in favor of Wm. Wilson conveying\r\n    their interest in their father's estate.\r\n\r\n    \"Provided always and these presents as well as the foregoing deed of\r\n    sale and conveyance are so made and executed by the said Robert\r\n    Holland acting as aforesaid (as attorney of the heirs Holland) upon\r\n    and subject to the _express_ charge and _condition_ that is to say,\r\n    that the said William Wilson his heirs and assigns shall forever hold\r\n    sacred and inviolable the small circular space of ground on the said\r\n    tract or piece of land and premises enclosed with a stone wall and\r\n    wherein the remains of the late Samuel Holland, Esquire, father of the\r\n    said vendors and of his son the late Samuel Holland jr., Esq., are\r\n    interred, and shall and will allow tree ingress and egress at all\r\n    times to the relatives and friends of the family of the said Samuel\r\n    Holland for the purpose of viewing the state and condition of the said\r\n    space of ground and making or causing to be made such repairs to the\r\n    wall enclosing the same or otherwise providing for the protection of\r\n    the said remains as they shall see fit.\"\r\n\r\n    Not many years back the 'small circular space' which Mr. Wilson bound\r\n    himself to hold sacred and inviolable and which contained two neat\r\n    marble slabs with the names of Messrs. Holland, senior and junior, and\r\n    other members of the family engraved on them, was inclosed within a\r\n    substantial stone wall to which access was had through an iron gate,\r\n    the walls were covered with inscriptions and with the initials of\r\n    those who had visited a spot to which the fatal issue of a deadly\r\n    encounter lent all the interest of a romance. Nothing now is visible\r\n    except the foundation, which is still distinct: the monument stones\r\n    have disappeared, the wall has been razed to the ground, some modern\r\n    Vandal or a descendant of the Ostrogoths [275] (for amongst all\r\n    civilized nations, the repose of the dead is sacred) has laid violent\r\n    hands on them! When Mr. Wilson sold Holland farm in 1843 he made no\r\n    stipulation about the graves of the Hollands, he took no care that\r\n    what he had agreed to hold inviolable should continue to be so held.\r\n\r\n    The tragical occurrence connected with the Holland Tree is much out of\r\n    the ordinary run of events, it seems very like the plot of a sensation\r\n    novel--a dark tale redolent with love, jealousy and revenge. Two men\r\n    stood, some sixty years ago, in mortal combat, not under the Holland\r\n    Tree, as it has generally been believed but near Windmill Point, Point\r\n    St Charles, at Montreal, one of them Ensign Samuel Holland, of the\r\n    60th Regiment, the other was Capt Shoedde. The encounter, it was\r\n    expected would be a deadly one in those duelling days blood alone\r\n    could wipe out an insult. Old Major Holland, on bidding adieu to his\r\n    son is reported to have said, \"Samuel, my boy, here are weapons which\r\n    my loved friend General Wolfe, presented me on the day of his death.\r\n    Use them, to keep the old family name without stain.\" Of this\r\n    memorable affair W. H. Henderson, Esq., of Hemison, has kindly\r\n    furnished me with the following details.\r\n\r\n    'The duel originated from some, it was considered, unjustifiable\r\n    suspicions on the part of Capt. Shoedde of his (Holland's) intimacy\r\n    with Mrs. Shoedde so palpably unfounded that young Holland applied to\r\n    his father as to whether in honour he was bound to take notice of the\r\n    matter. The Major replied by forwarding by post his pistols. Ensign\r\n    Holland was mortally wounded at the first shot, but in his agony rose\r\n    on his knees and levelled his pistol, aiming for Capt. Shoedde's\r\n    heart, who received the ball in his arm laid over his breast.'\r\n\r\n    Mr. Holland was conveyed to the Merchants Coffee House, in the small\r\n    lane, near the river side, called Capital street, where he expired in\r\n    great pain. The battalion in which this gentleman served was at that\r\n    time, commanded by Major Patrick Murray, a relative of the British\r\n    General of Quebec fame, with whom I became very intimate in the years\r\n    1808 and 1809. Major Murray's account of the duel agreed with the\r\n    general report prevalent in 1799 in Montreal. Murray thought that the\r\n    challenge had been given by young Holland and not by Shoedde. Murray\r\n    subsequently married sold his commission, and purchased the seignory\r\n    of Argenteuil. At that time Sir George Prevost was also a Major In the\r\n    60th Regiment of 1790, whilst Murray's commission dated of 1784. Sir\r\n    George gave Murray in 1812 a colonel's commission in the militia, who\r\n    raised the corps of lawyers in Montreal known, as styled by the\r\n    humorous old man, \"as The Devil s Own.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    _A SCANDAL OF THE LAST CENTURY._\r\n\r\n    One of the young Hollands had also been a party to a _scandalum\r\n    magnum_, which created much gossip amongst our grandfathers, about\r\n    the time H.R.H the Duke of Kent was at Quebec.\r\n\r\n    At a regimental mess dinner a handsome young fellow, having, in these\r\n    days of hard swearing and hard drinking, exceeded in wine, was\r\n    convicted of being a lady in disguise, attending as the guest of young\r\n    Holland, and whose sex was unknown to young Holland.\r\n\r\n    This lady, whom all Quebec knew as Mr. Nesbitt, turned out to be a\r\n    Miss Neville, left for England, and was eventually married to Sir J.\r\n    C---, brother of Lord F----, a British nobleman.\r\n\r\n    One of the Nestors of the present generation, Col. J. Sewell, has\r\n    related to me the circumstances as he heard them in his youth from the\r\n    lips of a man of veracity and honour--Hon. W. Smith, son of Chief\r\n    Justice Smith.\r\n\r\n    Here are his own words:--\"Hon. Mr. Smith told me that Mr. Nesbitt,\r\n    _alias_ Miss Neville, was dining at a mess dinner of the 24th\r\n    Grenadiers at the Jesuits' Barracks, upper Town market place--Having\r\n    sacrificed too freely to the rosy god, an officer of the 24th, Mr.\r\n    Broadstreet, I think, helped him to the balcony ... when having to\r\n    lean on his supporter, Mr. Broadstreet became confident Nesbitt was a\r\n    girl in disguise. Nesbitt drove out after dinner to Holland House and\r\n    Broadstreet told the joke all round. Nesbitt hearing of it, sent him,\r\n    next day, a challenge for originating such a report.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Broadstreet, not knowing how to act, applied to one of his\r\n    superior officers--Capt. Doyle (subsequently Genl. Doyle, who married\r\n    at Quebec, a Miss Smith), for advice, saying: \"How can I fight a\r\n    girl?\" to which Capt. Doyle rejoined, \"I will act as your second. If\r\n    Nesbitt is a girl, you shall not fight him, and I engage to prove this\r\n    fact.\" He then drove out to Holland House, and found the gay Lothario\r\n    Nesbitt flirting with the young ladies. He observed him attentively,\r\n    and having tried an experiment, calculated to throw light on the\r\n    mysterious foreigner, he went to complain direct to the Governor and\r\n    Commander in Chief; Lord Dorchester, who, on hearing the perplexity\r\n    caused by Mr. Nesbitt, sent for Dr. Longmore, the military physician,\r\n    and ordered him to investigate of what sex Nesbitt might be.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Nesbitt stormed--refused to submit--vowed he would go direct to\r\n    England and make a formal complaint of the indignity with which he was\r\n    threatened.\r\n\r\n    Hon. Jonathan Sewell,--later on Chief Justice, by persuasion,\r\n    succeeded in pouring oil on the troubled waters. Nesbitt confessed,\r\n    and Quebec was minus of a very handsome but beardless youngster, and\r\n    the English Court journals soon made mention of a fashionable marriage\r\n    in high life.\r\n\r\n\r\n_HAMWOOD._\r\n\r\n  How sweet it is, when mother Fancy rocks\r\n  The wayward brain, to saunter through a wood\r\n  An old place, full of many a lovely brood,\r\n  Tall trees, green arbours, and ground-flowers in flocks\r\n  And wild rose tiptoe upon hawthorn stocks,\r\n                           --_Wordsworth_.\r\n\r\nHow many vicissitudes in the destinies of places, men, families, nations!\r\nSee yonder mansion, its verdant leaves, with the leafy honours of nascent\r\nspring encircling it like a garland, exhaling the aroma of countless buds\r\nand blossoms, embellished by conservatory, grapery, avenues of fruit and\r\nfloral trees. Does not every object bespeak comfort, rural felicity,\r\ncommercial success!\r\n\r\nWhen you enter that snug billiard-room, luxuriously fitted up with fire\r\nplace, ottomans, &c., or when, on a balmy summer evening, you are seated\r\non the ample verandah, next to the kind host, do you not my legal friend,\r\nfeel inclined to repeat to yourself \"Commerce, commerce is the turnpike to\r\nhealth, to affluence, the path to consideration.\" But was the scene always\r\nso smiling, and redolent of rustic enjoyment.\r\n\r\nIf so, what means yon stately column, [276] surmounted by its fat,\r\nhelmetted Bellona, mysteriously looking round as if pregnant with a mighty\r\nunfathomable future. Ask history? Open Capt. Knox's _Journal of the\r\nSiege of Quebec_, and read therein how, in front of that very spot\r\nwhere you now stand, along that identical road, over which you emerged\r\nfrom the city, war once threw her sorrows, ask this brave British officer\r\nto retrace one of those winter scenes he witnessed here more than one\r\nhundred years ago: the howling blast of the north sighing through the few\r\nremaining gnarled pines and oaks spared by Albion's warriors; add to it\r\ntired teams of English troops, laboriously drawing, yoked eight by eight,\r\nlong sledges of firewood for Murray's depressed, harassed garrison, and\r\nyou have something like John Knox's _tableau_ of St. Foye Road on the\r\n7th December, 1759.--\r\n\r\n\"Our garrison, now undergo incredible fatigue, not only within but also\r\nwithout the walls, being obliged to load and sleigh home firewood from the\r\nforest of St. Foy, which is near four miles distant, and through snow of a\r\nsurpassing depth, eight men are allowed to each sleigh, who are yoked to\r\nit in couples by a set of regular harness, besides one man who guides it\r\nbehind with a long stout pole, to keep it clear of ruts and other\r\nobstructions. We are told that M. de Lévis is making great preparations\r\nfor the long-meditated assault on this place (Quebec) with which we are\r\nmenaced. Christmas is said to be the time fixed for this enterprise, and\r\n_Monsieur_ says, 'if he succeed he shall be promoted to be _Maréchal de\r\nFrance_, and if he fail, Canada will be lost, for he will give it up.'\"\r\n[277]\r\n\r\nDo not, dear reader, however fear for the old rock, it is tolerably secure\r\nso long as Fraser's Highlanders and British Grenadiers garrison it.\r\n\r\nWe have here endeavored to contrast the smiling present with the dreary\r\npast; peace, progress, wealth, as we find it to-day in this important\r\nappendage of the British Crown, ready to expand into an empire, with the\r\ndismal appearance of things when it was scantily settled, and in those\r\ndark days when war stalked through our land. Hamwood takes its name from\r\nthat of the paternal estate of the Hamiltons, county of Meath, Ireland,\r\nand without pretending to architectural excellence, it is one of the\r\nloveliest spots on the St. Foye road. It belongs to Robert Hamilton, Esq.,\r\na leading merchant of Quebec.\r\n\r\n\r\n_BIJOU._\r\n\r\n  And I have heard the whispers of the trees,\r\n    And the low laughter of the wandering wind,\r\n  Mixed with the hum of golden-belted bees,\r\n    And far away, dim echoes, undefined,--\r\n  That yet had power to thrill my listening ear,\r\n    Like footsteps of the spring that is so near.\r\n                      --(_Wood Voices_, KATE S. McL.)\r\n\r\nShall we confess that we ever had a fancy for historical contrasts? It is\r\nour weakness, perhaps our besetting sin; and when, on a balmy June day, at\r\nthe hour when the king of day it sipping the dew-drops from the flowers,\r\nwe ride past this unadorned but charming little Canadian home, next to\r\nWestfield, on the St. Foye heights, as it were sunning itself amidst\r\nemerald fields, fanned by the breath of the fragrant morn, enlivened by\r\nthe gambols of merry childhood; memory, in spite of us, brings back the\r\nghastly sights, the sickening Indian horrors, witnessed here on the 28th\r\nApril, 1760. There can be no doubt on this point; the mute, but eloquent\r\nwitnesses of the past are dug up every day: shot, shell, bullets, old\r\nbayonets, decayed military buttons, all in the greatest profusion.\r\n\r\n\"The savages,\" says Garneau, \"who were nearly all in the woods behind\r\nduring the fight, spread over the battle-field when the French were\r\npursuing the enemy, and killed many of the wounded British, whose scalps\r\nwere afterwards found upon neighboring bushes. As soon as De Lévis was\r\napprised of the massacre, he took vigorous measures for putting a stop to\r\nit. Within a comparatively narrow space nearly 2,500 men had been struck\r\nby bullets. The patches of snow and icy puddles on the ground were so\r\nreddened with the blood shed, that the frozen ground refused to absorb,\r\nand the wounded survivors of the battle were immersed in pools of gore and\r\nfilth, ankle deep.\"\r\n\r\nSuch _was_ the deadly strife in April, 1760, on the identical spot on\r\nwhich, reader, you and we now stand on the St. Foye heights. Such is\r\n_now_ the smiling aspect of things as you see them at Bijou, which\r\ncrowns the heights over the great Bijou marsh, etc., the dwelling of\r\nAndrew Thomson, Esq., (now President of the Union Bank of Quebec.) Some\r\nnatural springs in the flower garden, in rear of the dwelling, and slopes\r\nof the ground, when turned to advantage, in the way of terraces and\r\nfountains, bid fair to enhance materially the beauty of this rustic spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _ANECDOTE OF WOLFE'S ARMY (1760).--QUEBEC._\r\n\r\n    By a volunteer (J. T.).\r\n\r\n    \"At the Battle of the Plains of Abraham we had but one Piper, and\r\n    because he was not provided with Arms and the usual other means of\r\n    defence, like the rest of the men, he was made to keep aloof for\r\n    safety:--When our line advanced to the charge, General Townshend\r\n    observing that the Piper was missing, and knowing well the value of\r\n    one on such occasions, he sent in all directions for him, and he was\r\n    heard to say aloud. \"Where's the Highland Piper?\" and \"Five pounds for\r\n    a Piper;\" but devil a bit did the Piper come forward the sooner.\r\n    However, the charge, by good chance, was pretty well effected without\r\n    him, as all those that escaped could testify. For this business the\r\n    Piper was disgraced by the whole of the Regiment, and the men would\r\n    not speak to him, neither would they suffer his rations to be drawn\r\n    with theirs, but had them serv'd out by the Commissary separately, and\r\n    he was obliged to shift for himself as well as he could.\r\n\r\n    The next spring, in the month of April, when the Garrison of Quebec\r\n    was so madly march'd out, to meet the French, who had come down again\r\n    to attack us, and while we were on the retreat back to the Town, the\r\n    Highlanders, who were a raw undisciplin'd set, were got into great\r\n    disorder, and had become more like a mob than regular soldiers. On the\r\n    way I fell in with a captain Moses Hazen, [278] a Jew, who commanded a\r\n    company of Rangers, and who was so badly wounded, that his servant,\r\n    who had to carry him away, was obliged to rest him on the grounds at\r\n    every twenty or thirty yards, owing to the great pain he endured. This\r\n    intrepid fellow, observing that there was a solid column of the French\r\n    coming on over that high ground where Commissary General Craigie [279]\r\n    built his house, and headed by an Officer who was at some distance in\r\n    advance of the column, he ask'd his servant if his fuzee was stil\r\n    loaded? (The servant opened the pan, and found it is still prim'd).\r\n    \"Do you see,\" says Captain Hazen, \"that fellow there, waving his sword\r\n    to encourage those other fellows to come forward?\"--Yes, says the\r\n    servant, I do Sir;--Then, says the Captain again, \"just place your\r\n    back against mine for one moment, 'till I see if I can bring him\r\n    down.\" He accordingly stretch'd himself on the ground, and, resting\r\n    the muzzle of his fuzee on his toes, he let drive at the French\r\n    Officer. I was standing close behind him, and I thought it perfect\r\n    madness to attempt it. However, away went the charge after him, and\r\n    faith down he was in an instant. Both the Captain and myself were\r\n    watching for some minutes, under an idea that altho' he _had_ laid\r\n    down, he might perhaps take it into his head to get up again. But no.\r\n    And the moment that he fell, the whole column that he was leading on,\r\n    turn'd about and decamp'd off leaving him to follow as well as he\r\n    might! I could'nt help telling the Captain that he had made a capital\r\n    shot, and I related to him the affair of the foolish fellow of our\r\n    grenadiers who shot the savage at the landing at Louisbourg, altho'\r\n    the distance was great, and the rolling of the boat so much against\r\n    his taking a steady aim. \"Oh! yes, says Captain Hazen, you know that a\r\n    _chance shot_ will kill the Devil himself.\"\r\n\r\n    But, to return to the Highlanders: so soon as the Piper had discovered\r\n    that his men had scatter'd and were in disorder, he as soon\r\n    recollected the disgrace that still hung upon him, and he likely\r\n    bethought to give them a blast of his Pipes. By the Lord Harry! this\r\n    had the effect of stopping them short, and they allow'd themselves to\r\n    be formed into a sort of order. For this opportune blast of his\r\n    chanters, the Piper gain'd back the forgiveness of the Regiment, and\r\n    was allow'd to take his meals with his old messmates, as if nothing-\r\n    at-all had happened.\r\n\r\n    On the 6th May, 1760, which was after we had been driven back to the\r\n    town by the French, and while they yet lay in their trenches across\r\n    that high ground where the martello tower now stands, there came a\r\n    ship of war in sight, and she was for some considerable time tacking\r\n    across and across between Pointe Lévis and the opposing shore. We were\r\n    at a loss to know the meaning of all this, when the commanding Officer\r\n    of Artillery bethought himself to go and acquaint General Murray (who\r\n    had taken up his Quarters in Saint Louis Street, now (1828) the\r\n    Officer's Barracks) of the circumstance: He found the General in a\r\n    meditative mood, sitting before the fire in the chimney place. On the\r\n    Officer acquainting him that there was a ship of war in sight, the\r\n    General was quite electrified! He instantly got up, and, in the\r\n    greatest fury, order'd the Officer to have the colours immediately\r\n    hoisted on the citadel! Away he went, but dev'l a bit could the\r\n    halliards be made to go free until at last, a sailor was got hold of,\r\n    who soon scrambl'd up the flagstaff, and, put all to rights in a\r\n    jiffy.\r\n\r\n    All this time the ship of war did not show her own colours, not\r\n    knowing whether the town was in the hands of the French or the\r\n    English, but as soon as she perceived our flag, she hoisted English\r\n    colours, and shaped her course towards the town, and was soon safe at\r\n    anchor opposite to the King's Wharf. Our men had been all the winter\r\n    in bad spirits from coughs and colds, and, their having been obliged\r\n    to retreat from the French, did'nt help much to mend the matter.\r\n    However, when they heard that an English man-o-war was come, it was\r\n    astonishing how soon they became stout-hearted; faith, they were like\r\n    lions, and just as bold! The man-o-war prov'd to be the \"Lowestoffe,\"\r\n    which had been detached from the main fleet below, with orders to make\r\n    the best of time through the ice, and take up the earliest\r\n    intelligence of the approach of the fleet. Her sides were very much\r\n    torn by the floating ice. Our having hoisted colours for the first\r\n    time since the conquest, and a ship of war having made her appearance,\r\n    led the French to imagine that there was something strange going on.\r\n    Indeed they expected a fleet as well as ourselves, and this arrival\r\n    brought them out of their trenches, as thick as midges; they appeared\r\n    to us like so many pigeons upon a roost! whilst they were gaping at us\r\n    in such an exposed position, they received a salute from the whole\r\n    line of our guns, extending from Cape Diamond down to the Barrack\r\n    Bastion, and yet they went off almost like a single volley. It was\r\n    fearful enough to see how they tumbled down in their intrenchments,\r\n    like so many sacks of wool! Their seeing soldiers passing ashore from\r\n    our frigate, they thought that we were about to receive powerful\r\n    reinforcements, and they scamper'd away, their killed and wounded men\r\n    along with them. Our men soon were allow'd to go out, and they regaled\r\n    themselves upon the soup and pork which the French had left cooking on\r\n    the fires. That single discharge disabled so many of our guns, that we\r\n    had to get others then in the lower town, and our men were so weak\r\n    that they could not drag them up, but which was at last done with the\r\n    help of the sailors just arrived in the Fleet.\r\n\r\n    In about three days after the arrival of the \"Lowestoffe\" the\r\n    remainder of the Fleet came up to Quebec, and finding that the French\r\n    had some ships lying above Wolfe's Cove, they went up to look after\r\n    them. As soon as the French had seen them coming on, they slipp'd\r\n    their cables, and endeavor'd to get out of the way with the help of\r\n    the flood-tide, but the Commodore's ship got upon a ledge of rocks,\r\n    and stuck fast, and the crew took to the boats, and got ashore,\r\n    leaving the ship to take care of itself. There was found, on board of\r\n    this ship, one Mons. Cugnet and an Englishman call'd Davis, both of\r\n    whom had their hands tied behind their back, and a rope about their\r\n    neck, and they were inform'd that they both were to be hang'd at the\r\n    yard-arm so soon as the ship's company had finish'd their breakfast!\r\n\r\n    Monsieur Cugnet was the person who, at the Island of Orleans, gave\r\n    General Wolfe the information where would be the best place to get up\r\n    the bank above the Town, and Davis, who had been taken prisoner by the\r\n    French, some years before, had given some other kind of information,\r\n    and they both were to be punish'd as spies. However, they not only got\r\n    off with their lives, but were afterwards, well rewarded by our\r\n    Government. The former was appointed French-Translator to the\r\n    Government Offices, and something more, which enabled him to live\r\n    respectably; and Davis, who had been a grenadier-soldier, got a\r\n    pension of twenty five pounds a year: they both lived a long time in\r\n    the enjoyment of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_MORTON LODGE._\r\n\r\nThe extensive green pastures which General James Murray owned, in 1768, on\r\nthe St. Foy road, under the name of _Sans bruit_, [280] form at present\r\nseveral minor estates. One of the handsomest residences of this well\r\nwooded region was Morton Lodge, on the south side of the highway, and\r\nbounded by the Belvidère road,--about thirty-two acres in extent. It was\r\nhonored with this name by one of its former owners, the builder of the\r\nlodge, some sixty years ago--the late James Black, Esquire. Morton Lodge\r\nis built in the cottage style, with a suite of roomy apartments forming a\r\nspacious wing in rear; the lawns in front of the house, with a grove of\r\ntrees, add much to its beauty; a handsome conservatory to the east opens\r\non the drawing room; it is located in the centre of a flower garden. The\r\nadditional attraction of this residence, when owned by the late David\r\nDouglas Young was an extensive collection of paintings, purchased at\r\nvarious times by the owner both in Canada and in Europe: the French,\r\nFlemish and Italian schools were well represented, as well as Kreighoff's\r\nwinter scenery in Canada.\r\n\r\nMorton Lodge, for many years was the residence of David Douglass Young,\r\nEsquire, once President of the Quebec Bank, and formerly a partner of the\r\nlate George B. Symes, Esquire. Mr. Young claimed, on the maternal side, as\r\nancestor, Donald Fraser, one of Fraser's (78th) Highlanders, a regiment\r\nwhich distinguished itself at the taking of Quebec, whilst fighting under\r\nWolfe, on these same grounds.\r\n\r\nForming a portion of this estate, to the west, may be noticed a cosy\r\nlittle nest, _Bruce's Cottage_, as it was formerly called--now\r\nBannockburn--surrounded on all sides by trees, lawns and flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_WESTFIELD._\r\n\r\n    \"What, sir, said I,\" cut down Goldsmith's hawthorn bush, that supplies\r\n    so beautiful an image in the DESERTED VILLAGE! 'Ma foy,' exclaimed the\r\n    bishop (of Ardagh,) 'is that the hawthorn bush? then ever let it be\r\n    saved from the edge of the axe, and evil to him that would cut from it\r\n    a branch.\"--_Howitt's Homes and Haunts of British Poets_.\r\n\r\nAt Mount Pleasant, about one mile from St. John's Gate, a number of\r\nagreeable suburban residences have sprung up, as if by enchantment, within\r\na few years. This locality, from the splendid view it affords of the\r\nvalley of St. Charles, the basin of the St. Lawrence and surrounding\r\ncountry, has ever been appreciated. The most noticeable residence is a\r\ncommodious cut-stone structure, inside of the toll, erected there a few\r\nyears back by the late G. H. Simard, Esq., member for Quebec, and later,\r\npurchased by the late Fred. Vannovous, Esq., Barrister. Its mate in size\r\nand appearance a few acres to the west, on the St. Foye road, is owned by\r\nthe Hon. Eugene Chinic, Senator. In the vicinity, under the veil of a\r\ndense grove of trees, your eyes gather as you drive past, the outlines of\r\na massive, roomy homestead, on the north side of the heights, on a site\r\nwhich falls off considerably; groups of birch, maple, and some mountain\r\nash and chesnut trees, flourish in the garden which surrounds the house;\r\nin rear, flower beds slope down in an enclosure, whose surface is\r\nornamented with two tiny reservoirs of crystal water, which gushes from\r\nsome perennial stream, susceptible of great embellishment at little cost,\r\nby adding _Jets d'eau_. The declivities in rear seem as if intended\r\nby nature to be laid out into lovely terraces, with flowers or verdure to\r\nfringe their summits.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern section of the domain stands,\r\n\r\n  \"The hawthorne bush, with seats beneath the shade,\r\n  For talking age and whispering lovers made.\"\r\n\r\nWhether it blossoms on Christmas Day, like the legendary White Thorn of\r\nGlastonbury, \"which sprang from Joseph of Arimathea's dry staff, stuck by\r\nhim in the ground when he rested there\" deponent sayeth not. This majestic\r\nand venerable tree, branching out like a diminutive cedar of Lebanon, is\r\nindeed the pride of Westfield. It is evidently of very great age, though\r\neach summer as green, as fruitful as ever; the oldest inhabitant cannot\r\nrecall when it was smaller. If trees could reveal what has passed under\r\ntheir boughs, would not the veteran hawthorn tell of wounded men resting\r\nbeneath it; of the strange garb and cries of combatants, English, French,\r\nCelts, Canadians and Indians, on that luckless 28th April, 1760, when\r\nMurray's soldiers, were retreating in hot haste from St. Foye and placing\r\nthe city walls between them and Levi's victorious legions; of shot, shell\r\nand bullets, [281.] whistling through its hoary branches, on that\r\nmemorable 13th of September, 1759, when the _Sauvages d'Ecosse_, with\r\ntheir reeking claymores, were slashing at, and pursuing the French, flying\r\nfrom the battle field, over the St. Foye heights, to the French Camp on\r\nthe north bank of the St. Charles, in a line with the Marine Hospital.\r\nVarious indeed for as are the attractions of stately trees; we can\r\nunderstand why this one is the pride of Westfield. To us, an old denizen\r\nof the country, a stately tree has ever been a companionable; in fact, a\r\nreverential object. In our eyes 'tis not only rich in its own native\r\nbeauty; it may perchance also borrow interest from associations and become\r\na part of our home--of ourselves: it may have overshadowed the rustic\r\nseat, where, in our infant years, one dear to us and now departed, read\r\nthe Sunday hymn or taught us with a mother's sanctifying love to become a\r\ngood citizen, in every respect worthy of our sire. Perchance it may have\r\nbeen planted on the day of our birth; it may also commemorate the natal\r\nhour of our first-born, and may it not like ourselves, in our early days,\r\nhave required the fostering care of a guardian spirit,--the dews from\r\nheaven to refresh it and encourage its growth. Yes, like the proprietor of\r\nWestfield, we dearly love the old trees of our home.\r\n\r\nWe were invited to ascend to the loftiest point of this dwelling, and\r\ncontemplate from the platform on the roof the majestic spectacle at our\r\nfeet. Far below us waved the nodding pinnacles of countless forest trees;\r\nbeyond and around us, the site of the old battle-fields of 1759 and 1760,\r\nto the east, the white expanse of the St. Lawrence sleeping between the\r\nBeauport, Orleans and Point Levi shores; to the northwest, the snake-like\r\ncourse of the St. Charles, stealing through fertile meadows, copses of\r\nevergreens--until, by a supreme effort, it veers round the compass at the\r\nMarine Hospital; there, at sunset, it appears as if gamboling in the light\r\nof the departing luminary, whose rays anon linger in fitful glances on the\r\nspires of Lorette, Charlesbourg and St. Sauveur, until they fade away, far\r\naway in the cerulean distance, over the sublime crags of\r\n_Tsononthouan_,\r\n\r\n                     --\"of these our hills\r\n  the last that parleys with the setting sun.\"\r\n\r\nor else gild in amber tints, the wooded slopes of the lofty ridges to the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nWestfield, forms part of a larger expanse of land, formerly known as the\r\n\"Upper Bijou,\" crowning the heights, overhanging the valley of the St.\r\nCharles, where existed the \"Lower Bijou,\" marshy and green meadows, once\r\nsacred to snipe, and on which the populous suburb St. Sauveur has recently\r\nsprung up. It was granted in free and common soccage, to the late Charles\r\nGrey Stewart, Esq., in 18--; he resided there many years.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, this lovely old homestead, became the property of the Hon. David\r\nAlex. Ross, Barrister, M.P.P. for the county of Quebec, its present\r\noccupant. Several embellishments have been added to it by this gentleman\r\nand his lady; at present, the views, groves, parterres of Westfield during\r\nthe summer months are more attractive than ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n_COUCY-LE-CASTEL._\r\n\r\n  \"Sol Canadien, terre chérie\r\n  Par des braves tu fus peuplé,\r\n  Ils cherchaient, loin de leur patrie,\r\n    Une terre de liberté,\r\n  Qu'elles sont belles, nos campagnes,\r\n  Au Canada qu'on vit content!\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1830 that portion of the environs of Quebec watered by the\r\nRiver St. Charles, in the vicinity of Scott's bridge, had especially\r\nattracted the attention of several of our leading citizens as pleasant and\r\nhealthy abodes for their families. Two well known gentlemen in particular,\r\nthe bearers of old and respected names, the late Honorable Mr. Justice\r\nPhilippe Panet, and his brother the Honorable Louis Panet, \"Senator\r\nselected two adjoining lots covering close on eighty acres, on the banks\r\nof the St. Charles, the Cahire-Coubat of ancient days. The main road to\r\nthe east intervenes between the Hon. Judge Panet's seat and the mossy old\r\ndwelling in which Col. Arnold had his head-quarters during the winter of\r\n1775-76, now the residence of the Langlois family. Judge Panet built there\r\nan elegant villa on an Italian design, brought home after returning from\r\nthe sunny clime of Naples, the rooms are lofty and all are oval. Several\r\nhundred sombre old pines surround the house on all sides.\r\n\r\nThe neighboring villa, to the west, was planted by the Honorable Louis\r\nPanet, about 1830; also the grounds tastefully laid out in meadows,\r\nplantations and gardens, symmetrically divided off by neat spruce, thorn,\r\nand snowball hedges, which improve very much their aspect. One fir hedge,\r\nin particular, is of uncommon beauty. To the west an ancient pine, a\r\nveritable monarch of the forest, rears his hoary trunk, and amidst most\r\nluxuriant foliage looks down proudly on the young plantation beneath him,\r\nlending his hospitable shades to a semi-circular rustic seat--a grateful\r\nretreat during the heat of a summer's day. Next to this old tree runs a\r\nsmall rill, once dammed up for a fish-pond, but a colony of muskrats\r\nhaving \"unduly elected domicile thereat,\" the finny denizens disappeared\r\nas if by magic; and next, the voracious _rodents_ made so many raids\r\ninto the vegetable garden that the legal gentleman, who was lord of the\r\nmanor, served on them _a notice to quit_, by removing the dam. The\r\nejected amphibii crossed the river in a body and \"elected domicile\" in the\r\nroots of an elm tree at Poplar Grove, opposite and in full view of the\r\ncastle, probably by way of a threat. On the high river banks is a twelve-\r\npounder used formerly to crown a miniature fort erected over there. We\r\nremember on certain occasions hearing at a distance its loud _boom_.\r\nCoucy-le-Castel is surrounded on two sides by a spacious piazza, and\r\nstands on an elevated position close to the river bank. From the drawing-\r\nroom windows is visible the even course of the fairy Cahire-Coubat,\r\nhurrying past in dark eddies, under the pendulous foliage of some graceful\r\nelms which overhang the bank at Poplar Grove, the mansion of the late L.\r\nT. McPherson, Esq. Now and again from the small fort, amidst the murmur of\r\nrapids not far distant, you may catch the shrill note of the king-fisher\r\nin his hasty flight over the limpid stream, or see a lively trout leap in\r\nyonder deep pool; or else, in the midsummer vacation, see a birch canoe\r\nlazily floating down from _la mer Pacifique_, impelled by the arm of\r\na pensive law student, dreaming perchance of Pothier or Blackstone,--\r\nperchance of his lady love, whilst paddling to the air:--\r\n\r\n  \"Il y a longtemps que je t'aime\r\n  Jamais je ne t'oublierai.\"\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood of running water; the warbling of the birds; the distant\r\nlowing of kine in the green meadows; the variety and beauty of the\r\nlandscape, especially when the descending orb of day gilds the dark woods\r\nto the west, furnish a strikingly rural spectacle at Coucy-le-Castel, thus\r\nnamed from a French estate in Picardy, owned by the Badelarts, ancestors,\r\non the maternal side, of the Panets.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Coucy-le-Castel was purchased by Judge Jean Thomas Taschereau, of\r\nQuebec, under whose care it is acquiring each year new charms. A\r\nplantation of deciduous trees and evergreens has taken the place of the\r\nrow of poplars which formerly lined the avenue. The Judge's _Château_\r\nstands conspicuous amongst the pretty but less extensive surrounding\r\ncountry seats, such as the old mansion of Fred. Andrews, Esq., Q. C., the\r\nneat cottage of Fred. W. Andrews, Esq., Barrister, festooned with wild\r\nvines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_RINGFIELD._\r\n\r\n    FRANCISCUS PRIMUS, DEI GRATIA, FRANCORUM REX REGNAT.\r\n    Inscription on cross erected 3d May, 1536, by Jacques Cartier.\r\n\r\nWe will be pardoned for devoting a larger space than for other country\r\nseats, in describing Ringfield, on account of the important events of\r\nwhich it was the theatre.\r\n\r\nClose to the Dorchester Bridge to the west, on the Charlesbourg road,\r\nthere was once an extensive estate known as Smithville--five or six\r\nhundred acres of table land owned by the late Charles Smith, Esq., who for\r\nmany years resided in the substantial large stone dwelling subsequently\r\noccupied by A. Laurie, Esq., at present by Owen Murphy, Esq., opposite the\r\nMarine Hospital. Some hundred acres, comprising the land on the west of\r\nthe _ruisseau_ Lairet, known as _Ferme des Anges_, [282] were detached\r\nfrom it and now form Ringfield, whose handsome villa is scarcely visible\r\nfrom the Charlesbourg road in summer on account of the plantation of\r\nevergreens and other forest trees which, with white-thorn hedge, line\r\nits semicircular avenue on both sides. One might be inclined to regret\r\nthat this plantation has grown up so luxuriantly, as it interferes with\r\nthe striking view to be had here of the Island of Orleans, St. Lawrence,\r\nand surrounding parishes. Before the trees assume their vernal honours\r\nthere can be counted, irrespective of the city spires, no less than\r\nthirteen steeples of churches in so many parishes. Ringfield takes its\r\nname from its circular meadow (Montcalm's hornwork). In rear it is bounded\r\nto the west by the little stream called Lairet, with the _ruisseau_ St.\r\nMichel in view; to the south, its natural boundary is the meandering\r\nCahire-Coubat. [283]\r\n\r\nRingfield has even more to recommend it than the rural beauty common to\r\nthe majority of our country seats; here were enacted scenes calculated to\r\nawaken the deepest interest in every student of Canadian history. On the\r\nbanks of the River St. Charles, 1535-36, during his second voyage of\r\ndiscovery, Jacques Cartier, the intrepid navigator of St. Malo, more than\r\nthree centuries back, it is now generally supposed, wintered. We have\r\nChamplain's [284] authority for this historical fact, though, Charlevoix\r\nerroneously asserts that the great discoverer wintered on the banks of the\r\nRiver Jacques Cartier, twenty-seven miles higher up than Quebec. A careful\r\nexamination of _Lescarbot's Journal of Cartier's Second Voyage_, and\r\nthe investigations of subsequent historians leave little room to doubt\r\nChamplain's statement. [285] Jacques Cartier in his journal, written in\r\nthe quaint old style of that day, furnishes us curious descriptions of the\r\nlocality where he wintered, and of the adjoining Indian town,\r\n_Stadaconé_, the residence of the Chief Donacona. The Abbé Ferland\r\nand other contemporary writers have assigned as the probable site of\r\nStadacona that part of Quebec which is now covered by a portion of the\r\nsuburbs of St. John, and by that part of St. Roch looking towards the St.\r\nCharles. How graphically Jacques Cartier writes of that portion of the\r\nRiver St. Lawrence opposite the Lower Town, less than a mile in width,\r\n\"deep and swift running,\" and also of the \"goodly, fair and delectable bay\r\nor creek convenient and fit to harbour ships,\" the St. Charles (St. Croix\r\nor Holy Cross) river! and again of the spot wherein, he says, \"we stayed\r\nfrom the 15th of September, 1535, to the 6th May, 1536, and there our\r\nships remained dry.\" Cartier mentions the area of ground adjoining to\r\nwhere he wintered \"as goodly a plot of ground as possible may be seen,\r\nand, wherewithal, very fruitful, full of goodly trees even as in France,\r\nsuch as oak, elm, ash, walnut trees, white-thorns and vines that bring\r\nforth fruit as big as any damsons, and many other sort of trees; tall hemp\r\nas any in France, without any seed or any man's work or labor at all.\"\r\nThere are yet some noble specimens of elm, the survivors of a thick clump,\r\nthat once stood on the edge of the hornwork. The precise spot in the St.\r\nCharles where Cartier moored his vessels and where his people built the\r\nfort [286] in which they wintered may have been, for aught that could be\r\nadvanced to the contrary, where the French government in 1759 built the\r\nhornwork or earth redoubt, so plainly visible to this day, near the Lairet\r\nstream. It may also have been at the mouth of the St. Michel stream which\r\nhere empties itself into the St. Charles, on the Jesuits' farm. The\r\nhornwork or circular meadow, as the peasantry call it, is in a line with\r\nthe General Hospital, Mount Pleasant, St. Bridget's Asylum and the\r\ncorporation lots recently acquired by the Quebec Seminary for a botanical\r\ngarden and seminary, adjoining Abraham's Plains. Jacques Cartier's fort,\r\nwe know to a certainty, must have been on the north bank of the river,\r\n[287] from the fact that the natives coming from Stadacona to visit their\r\nFrench guests had to cross the river, and did so frequently. It does seem\r\nstrange that Champlain does not appear to have known the exact locality\r\nwhere, seventy years previously, Stadacona had stood; the cause may lie in\r\nthe exterminating wars carried on between the several savage tribes,\r\nleaving, occasionally, no vestige of once powerful nations and villages.\r\nHave we not seen in our day a once warlike and princely race--the Hurons--\r\ndwindle down, through successive decay, to what _now_ remains of them?\r\n\r\nA drawing exists, copied from an engraving executed at Paris, the subject\r\nof which, furnished by G. B. Faribault, Esquire, retraced the departure of\r\nthe St. Malo mariner for France on the 6th of May, 1536. To the right may\r\nbe seen, Jacques Cartier's fort, [288] built with stockades, mounted with\r\nartillery, and subsequently made stronger still, we are told, with ditches\r\nand solid timber, with drawbridge, and fifty men to watch night and day.\r\n\r\nNext comes the _Grande Hermine_, his largest vessel, of about one\r\nhundred and twenty tons, in which Donacona, the interpreter, and two other\r\nIndians of note, treacherously seized, are to be conveyed to France, to be\r\npresented to the French monarch, Francis I. Close by, the reader will\r\nobserve _l'Emerillon_, of about forty tons in size, the third of his\r\nships; and higher up, the hull of a stranded and dismantled vessel, the\r\n_Petite Hermine_, of about sixty tons, intended to represent the one\r\nwhose timbers were dug up at the mouth of the St. Michel in 1843, and\r\ncreated such excitement amongst the antiquaries of that day. On the\r\nopposite side of the river, at Hare Point, the reader will notice on the\r\nplate, a cross, intended to represent the one erected by Cartier's party\r\non the 3rd May, 1536, in honour of the festival of the Holy Cross; at the\r\nfoot a number of Indians and some French in the old costume of the time of\r\nFrancis I. So much for Jacques Cartier and his winter quarters, in 1535-\r\n36.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and twenty-three years after this date we find this locality\r\nagain the arena of memorable events. In the disorderly retreat of the\r\nFrench army on the 13th of September, 1759, from the heights of Abraham,\r\nthe panic-stricken squadrons came pouring down Côte d'Abraham and Côte à\r\nCotton, hotly pursued by the Highlanders and the 58th Regiment, hurrying\r\ntowards the bridge of boats and following the shores of the River St.\r\nCharles until the fire of the hulks anchored in the river stopped the\r\npursuit. On the north side of the bridge of boats was a _tête de\r\npont_, redoubt or hornwork, a strong work of pentagonal shape, well\r\nportrayed in Tiffeny's plan of the Siege Operations before Quebec. This\r\nhornwork was-partly wood, defended by palisades, and towards Beauport, an\r\nearthwork--covering about twelve acres, the remains (the round or ring\r\nfield), standing more than fifteen feet above the ground, may be seen to\r\nthis day surrounded by a ditch, three thousand [289] men at least must\r\nhave been required to construct, in a few weeks, this extensive\r\nentrenchment. In the centre stood a house, visible on a plan of Mr.\r\nParke's, in which, about noon on that memorable day, a pretty lively\r\ndebate was taking place. Vaudreuil and some of the French officers were at\r\nthat moment and in this spot debating the surrender of the whole colony.\r\nLet us hear an eye-witness, Chevalier Johnstone, General de Lévis' aide-\r\nde-camp, one of the Scotchmen fighting in Canada for the French king,\r\nagainst some of his own countrymen under Wolfe, after the disaster of\r\nCulloden. It was our good fortune to publish the recently-discovered\r\njournal of this Scotch officer for the first time in 1864. Chevalier\r\nJohnstone's description will strike every one from its singular\r\naccuracy:--\r\n\r\n    \"The French army in flight, scattered and entirely dispersed, rushed\r\n    towards the town. Few of them entered Quebec; they went down the\r\n    heights of Abraham opposite the Intendant's Palace (past St. John's\r\n    gate) directing their course to the hornwork, and following the\r\n    borders of the River St. Charles. Seeing the impossibility of rallying\r\n    our troops I determined myself to go down the hill at the windmill\r\n    near the bake house [290] and from thence across over the meadows to\r\n    the hornwork resolved not to approach Quebec from my apprehension of\r\n    being shut up there with a part of our army which might have been the\r\n    case if the victors had drawn all the advantage they could have reaped\r\n    from our defeat. It is true the death of the General-in-chief--an\r\n    event which never fails to create the greatest disorder and confusion\r\n    in an army--may plead as an excuse for the English neglecting so easy\r\n    an operation as to take all our army prisoners.\r\n\r\n    The hornwork had the River St. Charles before it about seventy paces\r\n    broad which served it better than an artificial ditch; its front\r\n    facing the river and the heights was composed of strong thick and high\r\n    palisades planted perpendicularly with gunholes pierced for several\r\n    pieces of large cannon in it, the river is deep and only fordable at\r\n    low water at a musket shot before the fort: this made it more\r\n    difficult to be forced on that side than on its other side of\r\n    earthworks facing Beauport which had a more formidable appearance and\r\n    the hornwork certainly on that side was not in the least danger of\r\n    being taken by the English by an assault from the other side of the\r\n    river. On the appearance of the English troops on the plain of the\r\n    lake house Montguet and La Motte, two old captains in the Regiment of\r\n    Béarn, cried out with vehemence to M. de Vaudreuil, that the hornwork\r\n    would be taken in an instant, by an assault sword in hand, that we\r\n    would all be cut to pieces without quarter and nothing else would save\r\n    us but an immediate and general capitulation of Canada giving it up to\r\n    the English.\r\n\r\n    Montreul told them that a fortification such as the hornwork was not\r\n    to be taken so easily. In short there arose a general cry in the\r\n    hornwork to cut the bridge of boats. [291] It is worth of remark that\r\n    not a fourth part of our army had yet arrived at it and the remainder\r\n    by cutting the bridge would have been left on the other side of the\r\n    river as victims to the victors. The regiment Royal Roussillon was at\r\n    that moment at the distance of a musket shot from the hornwork\r\n    approaching to pass the bridge. As I had already been in such\r\n    adventures, I did not lose my presence of mind, and having still a\r\n    shadow remaining of that regard which the army accorded me on account\r\n    of the esteem and confidence which M. de Lévis and M. de Montcalm had\r\n    always shewn me publicly, I called to M. Hugon, who commanded, for a\r\n    pass in the hornwork and begged of him to accompany me to the bridge.\r\n    We ran there and without asking who had given the order to cut it, we\r\n    chased away the soldiers with their uplifted axes ready to execute\r\n    that extravagant and wicked operation.\r\n\r\n    \"M. Vaudreuil was closeted in a house in the inside of the hornwork\r\n    with the Intendant and some other persons. I suspected they were busy\r\n    drafting the articles for a general capitulation and I entered the\r\n    house, where I had only time to see the Intendant with a pen in his\r\n    hand writing on a sheet of paper, when M. Vaudreuil told me I had no\r\n    business there. Having answered him that what he said was true, I\r\n    retired immediately, in wrath to see them intent on giving up so\r\n    scandalously a dependancy for the preservation of which so much blood\r\n    and treasure had been expended. On leaving the house, I met M.\r\n    Dalquier, an old, brave, downright honest man, commander of the\r\n    regiment of Béarn, with the true character of a good officer--the\r\n    marks of Mars all over his body. I told him it was being debated\r\n    within the house to give up Canada to the English by a capitulation,\r\n    and I hurried him in, to stand up for the King's cause, and advocate\r\n    the welfare of his country. I then quitted the hornwork to join\r\n    Poulanes at the Ravine [292] of Beauport, but having met him about\r\n    three or four hundred paces from the hornwork, on his way to it, I\r\n    told him what was being discussed there. He answered me, that sooner\r\n    than consent to a capitulation, he would shed the last drop of his\r\n    blood. He told me to look on his table and house as my own, advised me\r\n    to go there directly to repose myself, and clapping spurs to his\r\n    horse, he flew like lightning to the hornwork.\"\r\n\r\nWant of space precludes us from adding more from this very interesting\r\njournal of the Chevalier Johnstone, replete with curious particulars of\r\nthe disorderly retreat of the French regiments from their Beauport camp,\r\nafter dark, on that eventful 13th September, how they assembled first at\r\nthe hornwork, and then filed off by detachments on the Charlesbourg road,\r\nthen to Ancient Lorette, until they arrived, worn out and disheartened\r\nwithout commanders, at day break at Cap Rouge.\r\n\r\nOn viewing the memorable scenes witnessed at Ringfield,--the spot where\r\nthe French discoverer wintered in 1535-36, and also the locality, where it\r\nwas decided to surrender the colony to England in 1759--are we not\r\njustified in considering it as both the _cradle_ and the _tomb_ of French\r\nDominion in the new world?\r\n\r\nRingfield has, for many years, been the family mansion of George Holmes\r\nParke, Esquire.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTOR VILLE\r\n\r\n  \"In woods or glens I love to roam,\r\n* * * *\r\nOr by the woodland pool to rest.\"\r\n\r\nIn the deepest recesses of the Lorette woods, amongst the most shady\r\nmeanders of the sinuous Cahire Coubat, some five miles due north from\r\nCastel-Coucy, we know a bank, not precisely where\r\n\r\n  \"The wild thyme grows,\"\r\n\r\nbut where you are sure, in spring and summer, to pluck handfuls of\r\ntrilliums, wild violets, ferns of rare beauty, columbines, kalmias,\r\nladies' slippers, ladies' tresses (we mean of course the floral subjects).\r\nIn this beauteous region, sacred to Pan, the Naiades, Dryades, and the\r\ndaughters of Mnemosyne, you might possibly, dear reader, were you\r\nprivileged with a pass from one of our most respected friends, be allowed\r\nto wander; or perchance in your downward voyage from Lake Charles to the\r\nLorette Falls, in that _vade mecum_ of a forester's existence--a birch\r\ncanoe--you might, we repeat, possibly be allowed to pitch your camp\r\non one of the mossy headlands of Castor Ville, and enjoy your luncheon, in\r\nthis sylvan spot, that is, always presuming you were deemed competent to\r\nfully appreciate nature's wildest charms, and rejoice, like a true lover,\r\nin her coyest and most furtive glances.\r\n\r\nCastor Ville, a forest wild, where many generations of beavers, otters,\r\ncaribou, boars, foxes and hares once roamed, loved and died, covers an\r\narea of more than one hundred acres. Through it glides the placid course\r\nof the St. Charles--overhung by hoary fir trees--from the parent lake to\r\nthe pretty Indian Lorette Falls, a distance of about eight miles of fairy\r\nscenery, which every man of taste, visiting Lake St. Charles, ought to\r\nenjoy at least once in his life. It is all through mantled over by a dense\r\nsecond growth of spruce and fir trees, intersected by a maze of avenues.\r\nThe lodge sits gracefully, with its verandah and artillery, on a peninsula\r\nformed by the _Grand Desert_ and St. Charles streams. You can cross\r\nover in a canoe to that portion of the domain beyond the river: along the\r\nbanks, a number of resting places--tiny bowers of birch bark--dingies and\r\ncanoes anchored all round--here and there a _portage_--close by, a\r\nveritable Indian wigwam--_Oda Sio_ [293] by name. On a bright morning\r\nin early spring, you may chance to meet, in one of the paths, or in his\r\ncanoe, a white-haired hunter, the Master of Castor Ville, returning home\r\nafter visiting his hare, fox, or otter traps, proudly bearing _Lepus_\r\nin his game bag, next to which you may discover a volume of _Molière_,\r\n_Montaigne_ or _Montesquieu_. On selling Castle-Coucy, its loyal-hearted\r\nold proprietor, taking with him the guns of the fort, retired to the\r\npresent wild demesne, in which occasionally he passes, with his family,\r\nmany pleasant hours, amidst books, friends and rural amusements, far from\r\ncity noises and city excitement.\r\n\r\nCastor Ville belongs to the Hon. Louis Panet, member of the Legislative\r\nCouncil of Canada.\" (Written in 1865.)\r\n\r\nSince this little sketch was penned, sixteen years ago, the unwelcome\r\nshadow of years has crept over our old friend, eighty-six winters and then\r\nfrost has cooled the ardor of the _Chasseur_, Castor Ville for Mr. Panet\r\nhas lost much of its sunshine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE JOYS OF WINTER._\r\n\r\n  \"Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow,\r\n  Filling the earth and sky below,\r\n  Over the house-tops, over the street,\r\n  Over the heads of the people you meet,\r\n       Dancing,\r\n                Flirting,\r\n                          Skimming along,\r\n  Beautiful snow, it can do no wrong,\r\n  Flying to kiss a lady's cheek,\r\n  Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,\r\n  Beautiful snow from the heaven above,\r\n  Pure as an angel, gentle as love!\r\n\r\n  Oh! the snow, the beautiful snow\r\n  How the flakes gather and laugh as they go,\r\n  Whirling about in the maddening fun,\r\n  It plays in its glee with every one,\r\n       Chasing,\r\n                Laughing,\r\n                          Hurrying by,\r\n  It lights on the face and sparkles the eye!\r\n  And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound,\r\n  Snap at the crystals that eddy around,\r\n  The town is alive, and its heart is aglow!\r\n  To welcome the coming of the beautiful snow\r\n\r\n  How the wild crowds go swaying along,\r\n  Hailing each other with humour and song,\r\n  How the gay sledges, like meteors, pass by,\r\n  Bright for the moment, then lost to the eye,\r\n       Ringing,\r\n                Swinging,\r\n                          Dashing they go,\r\n  Over the crust of this beautiful snow,\r\n  Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,\r\n  To he trampled and tracked by the crowd rushing by,\r\n  To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet,\r\n  Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.\"\r\n\r\nHas it ever been your fortune, kind reader, to enjoy, in the depth of\r\nwinter, a ramble in a Canadian forest, at the mystic hour when the Queen\r\nof Night asserts her silent sway? Have you ever revelled in this feast of\r\nsoul, fresh from the busy hum of city life--perchance strolling up a\r\nmountain path with undulating plains of spotless whiteness behind you, or\r\nelse canopied by the leafy dome of odorous pines or green hemlock, with no\r\nother companion but your trusty rifle, nor other sound but the hoot of the\r\nGreat Horned Owl, disturbed by the glare of your camp fire--or the rustle\r\nof the passing hare, skulking fox, or browsing cariboo? Have you ever been\r\ncompelled, venturesome hunter as you are, with the lengthening shades of\r\nevening, after a twenty miles' run, to abandon the blood-stained trail,\r\nreserving for the morrow the slaying of the stricken cariboo? Can you\r\nrecall the sense of weariness, with which you retraced your heavy steps to\r\nthe camp--perspiring at every pore,--panting with thirst--famished--\r\nperhaps bewildered with the flakes of the gathering storm--yea, so\r\nexhausted, that the crackling of the pine faggots of your mountain hut--\r\nwatched over in your absence by your faithful Indian \"Gabriel\" [294]--\r\nstruck on your quickened senses amidst the winter gloom like heavenly\r\nmusic--sounds as soft, as welcome as the first April sunbeam? Have you\r\never had the hardiness to venture with an Indian guide and toboggin on an\r\nangling tour far north in the Laurentian chain, to that _Ultima Thule_\r\nsacred to the disciples of old Isaac. Snow Lake, over chasm, dale,\r\nmountain, pending that month dear above all others to King Hiems--\r\ninexorable January? If so, you can indeed boast of having held communion\r\nwith the grim God of Winter in some of his stern, though captivating,\r\nmoods. Nor are these the only charms which the capricious monarch has in\r\nstore.\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget, one balmy March morning, sauntering along the green\r\nuplands of Sillery, towards the city, while the \"sun god\" was pouring\r\noverhead, waves of soft, purple light. The day previous, one of our\r\nannual, equinoctial storms had careered over the country; first, wind and\r\nsnow; then wind and sleet, the latter dissolving into icy tears,\r\nencircling captive Nature in thousands of weird, glossy crystals; every\r\ntree of the forest, according to its instinct, its nature, writhing in the\r\nconqueror's cold embrace--rigid, creaking, ready to snap in twain rather\r\nthan bend, as the red oak or sugar maple, or else meekly, submissively\r\ncurving to the earth its tapering, frosted limbs, like the silver birch--\r\nelegant, though fragile, ornament of the Canadian park, or else, rearing\r\namid air a graceful net-work--waving, transparent sapphire-tinted\r\narabesques, stretched on amber pillars; witness the Golden Willow. Each\r\ngleam of sunshine investing this gorgeous tapestry with all the glories of\r\nIris; here, rising above his compeers, a stately lord of the grove, hoary\r\nwith frost and years, whose outspreading boughs are burnished, as if every\r\ntwig had been touched by the hand of an enchanter, whilst there, under his\r\nshade, bends a mountain ash, smeared with the crimsoned berries of the\r\npreceding summer, now ice-coated _bon-bons_ eagerly plucked by troops\r\nof roseate grosbeaks resting on the whitened branches. How lovely the\r\ncontrasts!\r\n\r\nSuch, the scene in the winsome light of day. But of those objects, viewed\r\nby moonlight, who would have dared becomingly depict the wild beauty? The\r\nsame incomparable landscape, with Diana's silver rays softly sleeping on\r\nthe virgin snow; on each side, an avenue of oak, spruce and fir trees, the\r\nlatter with their emerald boughs wreathed in solid ice, and to the earth\r\ngracefully bending in festoons--now and again kissed by the night wind; at\r\neach wavy motion disclosing their dark trunks, under the frozen foliage,\r\nlike old Ocean's billows breaking on dark rocks; the burnished gold of the\r\nmorn changed into silver floss, twinkling with a mild radiance, under the\r\neye of night, like diamond tiaras--a vista fit for Queen Mab! Of such,\r\nmayhap dreamed Moorish maid, under the portals of the Alhambra. Were\r\nArmida's enchanted forests brighter?\r\n\r\nWho can describe all thy witchery? Thy nameless graces, who can compass,\r\nserene majesty of Winter in the North? And yet all these glories of frost\r\nand moon-lit snows we once did see round our Canadian Home.\r\n\r\nWouldst thou fancy another view of winter less serene; a contrast such as\r\nglorious old KIT NORTH would have revelled in? Step forward, my witty, my\r\nsarcastic friend of the _Evènement_ newspaper--by name Henri Fabre!\r\n\r\n\"The true season of Canada is winter; winter with its bright skies by day\r\nand its brighter stars by night. Of spring we have none. April is nothing\r\nbetter than a protracted thaw, with scenes of mud and melting snow. May,\r\nthe month dear to poets, is frequently but an uninterrupted succession of\r\nshowers to fecundate the earth; its symbol, an array of outspread\r\numbrellas in our streets. As to our summer, it is but the epitome of the\r\nlovely summer of France and Italy for the use of new countries. Autumn is\r\na shade better; but anon, the first frost hurries on to blanch and\r\ndisperse the leaves and dim the hues of mellowed nature. When the fields\r\nslumber under ten feet of snow; when human noses freeze before their\r\nsneezing owners have time to utter a cry for help, then is the _beau\r\nideal_ of our climate. He who on such an occasion dares to sigh for the\r\nboasted shade of trees and the murmur of gushing waters, that man is no\r\ntrue Canadian. The searching wind, the cold, the northern blast, [295] are\r\npart and parcel of our country; one is bound to love them. Should they\r\nincrease in intensity, rub your hands, first to keep yourself warm, nest\r\nto denote your patriotic joy!\"\r\n\r\nBut all this won't prevent us from exclaiming with a Canadian son of song:\r\n\r\n  \"Oh! dear is the Northern forest home,\r\n  Where the great pine shoots on high;\r\n  And the maple spreads its soft, green leaves\r\n  In the clear, blue, taintless sky;\r\n  Though the summer mantle paleth fast\r\n    Into winter's virgin veil\r\n  There is health in the fierce, quick lightning blast,\r\n    And strength in the icy gale;\r\n  And life glides on in a quiet calm,\r\n    Like our own great river's flow;\r\n  And dear to the hearts of her children all\r\n    Is our own FAIR LAND OF SNOW!\"\r\n\r\n  SILLERY, near Quebec, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE MANOR HOUSE, BEAUPORT_.\r\n\r\nLet us view a remnant of feudal times.\r\n\r\nOn the Beauport road, four miles from the city and about forty feet from\r\nthe late Colonel B. C. A. Gugy's habitation, stood until 1879 an\r\nantiquated high-gabled French stone dwelling, very substantially put\r\ntogether. About thirty years back there was still existing close to and\r\nconnected with it, a pavilion or tower, used in early days as a fort to\r\nprotect the inmates against Indian raids. It contained the boudoir and\r\nsleeping apartments of some of the fair _seignieuresses_ [296] of Beauport\r\nin the house which Robert Giffard, the first seignor built there more than\r\ntwo centuries ago; it is the oldest seignorial manor in Canada. Robert\r\nGiffard's house--or, more properly, his shooting box--is thought to have\r\nstood closer to the little stream to the west. The first seignior of\r\nBeauport had two daughters who married two brothers, Juchereau, the\r\nancestors of the Duchesnays; and the manor has been in the possession of,\r\nand occupied by, the Duchesnays for more than two hundred years.\r\n\r\nRobert Giffard had visited Canada, for the first time, in 1627, in the\r\ncapacity of a surgeon; and being a great sportsman, he built himself a\r\nsmall house on the banks of the Beauport stream, to enjoy to perfection,\r\nhis favorite amusements--shooting and fishing. No authentic data exist of\r\nthe capacity of Beauport for game in former days; we merely read in the\r\n_Relations des Jésuites_ that in the year 1648. 1200 ptarmigan were\r\nshot there, we also know that the quantities of ducks congregating on the\r\nadjoining _flats_ caused the place to be called _La Canardière_. There is\r\na curious old record in connection with this manor, exhumed by the Abbé\r\nFerland; it is the exact formula used by one of the tenants or\r\n_censitaires_ in rendering _foi et hommage_ to the Lord of the Manor.\r\nGuion (Dion?), a tenant, had by sentence of the Governor, Montmagny, been\r\ncondemned on the 30th July, 1640, to fulfil this feudal custom. The\r\ndocument recites that, after knocking at the door of the chief manorial\r\nentrance, and in the absence of the master, addressing the farmer, one\r\nBoulle, the said Guion, having knelt down bare headed without his sword or\r\nspurs, repeated three times the words,--\"_Monsieur de Beauport, Monsieur\r\nde Beauport, Monsieur de Beauport, je vous fais et porte la foy et hommage\r\nque je suis tenu de vous porter, a cause de mon fief du Buisson,_ [297]\r\n_duquel je suis homme de foy relevant de votre seigneurie de Beauport,\r\nlequel m'appartient au moyen du contrat que nous avons passe ensemble par\r\ndevant Roussel à Mortagne, le_ 14 _Mars_, 1634, _vous déclarant que je\r\nvous offre payer les droits seigneuriaux et féodaux quand dûs seront, vous\r\nréquerant me recevoir à la dite foy et homage._\" \"Lord of Beauport, Lord\r\nof Beauport, Lord of Beauport, I render you the fealty and homage due to\r\nyou on account of my land du Buisson ... which belongs to me by virtue of\r\nthe title-deed executed between us in presence of Roussel at Mortagne, the\r\n14th March, 1634, avowing my readiness to acquit the seignorial and feudal\r\nrents whenever they shall be due, beseeching you to admit me to the said\r\nand homage.\" This Guion, a mason by trade, observes the Abbé Ferland, was\r\nthe man of letters and scribe of the parish. There is still extant a\r\nmarriage contract, drafted by him, for two parishioners; it is one of the\r\nearliest on record in Canada, bearing date the 16th July, 1636. It is\r\nsigned by the worthy Robert Giffard, the seignior, and by Francois\r\nBellanger and Noël Langlois; the other parties affixed their mark. It\r\npossesses interest as serving to illustrate the status and education of\r\nthe early French settlers. In 1628, Robert Giffard had been taken a\r\nprisoner of war by the English, on board of Rocmont's fleet. On his\r\nreturn, and in acknowledgement of the services rendered by him to the\r\ncolonial authorities, he obtained a grant of the seigniory of Beauport,\r\ntogether with a large tract of land, on the River St. Charles. For many\r\nlong years the ancestral halls of the Duchesnays, at Beauport, rang with\r\nthe achievements of their warlike seigneurs. One of them, Nicholas\r\nJuchereau de St. Denys, so distinguished himself at the siege of Quebec in\r\n1690, that his sovereign granted him \"a patent of nobility.\" (\"_Le sieur\r\nde St. Denys, seigneur de Beauport, _\" says Charlevoix, \"_commandait ses\r\nhabitants, il avait plus de soixante ans et combattait avec beaucoup de\r\nvaleur, jusqu'a ce qu'il eut un bras casse d'un coup de feu. Le Roi\r\nrécompensa peu de temps après son zèle en lui accordant des lettres de\r\nnoblesse._\") His son distinguished himself in Louisiana. Two other\r\nmembers of the family won laurels at Châteaugay. A descendant, Lieut.-Col.\r\nThéodore Duchesnay, is Deputy Adjutant General of Militia.\r\n\r\nThe late Col. Gugy, built himself, in 1865, close to the manor, a\r\ncomfortable dwelling, wherein, amidst rural retirement, he divided his\r\nexistence between literature, briefs and his stud, noted all over Canada.\r\nHe had recently added to his domain, by purchase, a large tract of land\r\nfrom the adjoining property, the De Salaberry homestead, where H.R.H.\r\nthe Duke of Kent, the father of our beloved Queen, in 1791 enjoyed more\r\nthan one _petit souper_. The broad acres which in 1759 resounded to\r\nthe tread of Montcalm's heavy squadrons, for years the quiet home of a\r\nbarrister of note, now bear the name of Darnoc. _Cedant arma togae._\r\n\r\nDarnoc, since the death of Col. Gugy, in 1878, is occupied by Mrs. Gugy\r\nand Herman Ryland, Esq., who married a daughter of the late proprietor.\r\nThe ruins of the Duchesnay Manor, more than once have been disturbed by\r\nthe pick and shovel of the midnight seeker for hidden French piastres:\r\nthough religiously protected against outrage by Mrs. Gugy's family, and\r\nmore especially watched over by the _Genius Loci_, the divining rod\r\nand a _Petit Albert_ have recently found their way there; however\r\nsuccessfully poised and backed by the most orthodox incantations and\r\nfumigations, the magic rod has failed so far to bring to the surface\r\neither gold or silver coin. This was probably owing to the omission of a\r\nvery important ceremony: the production on the spot of \"a candle [298]\r\nmade out of the fat of an executed murderer, as the clock strikes twelve\r\nat midnight,\" under suitable planetary influence.\r\n\r\nThe recent discovery of the corner stone of the old manor, and of an\r\ninscription dating back to 1634, have given rise to a spicy newspaper\r\ndiscussion among our antiquarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE SEIGNIORIAL MANOR OF THE FIRST SEIGNEUR OF BEAUPORT, 1614._\r\n\r\n                       I.H.S.

B. C. A. Gugy, of Darnoc, Beauport, a lead\r\nplate, with the above quoted inscription, and a note, stating under what\r\ncircumstances Col. Gugy's family became possessed of it. This lead plate,\r\naffords a written record of the laying of the foundation stone, on the\r\n25th July, 1634, of the historical homestead of the fighting _Seigneurs_\r\nof Beauport: the Gifart, the Juchereau, the Duchesnay.\r\n\r\nThe massive old pile alleged to have been the headquarters of the Marquis\r\nde Montcalm, during the siege of Quebec, in 1759, and in which many\r\ngenerations of Duchesnays and some of Col. Gugy's children were born,\r\nbecame the prey of flames in 1879, 'tis said, by the act of a Vandal. Thus\r\nperished the most ancient stronghold of the proud feudal Lairds of\r\nBeauport, of the stone manor of Surgeon Robert Giffard; the safe retreat\r\nagainst the Iroquois of the warlike Juchereau Duchesnays, one of whose\r\nancestors, in 1645, had married Marie Gifart, or Giffard, a daughter of\r\nthe bellicose Esculapius from Perche, France,--Surgeon Robert Gifart.\r\nGrim and defiant the antique manor, with its high-peaked gables, stood in\r\nfront of the dwelling Col. Gugy had erected, at Darnoc, in 1865: it rather\r\nintercepted the view to be had from this spot, of Quebec. One of the\r\nmemorable landmarks of the past, it has furnished a subject for the pencil\r\nof Col. Benson J. Lossing, author of the \"American Revolution,\" and \"Life\r\nof Washington,\" who, during his visit to Quebec, in July, 1858, sketched\r\nit with others, for _Harper's Magazine_, where it appeared, over the\r\nheading \"Montcalm's Headquarters, Beauport,\" in the January number, 1859,\r\npage 180, from which drawing it was transferred to the columns of the\r\nCanadian _Illustrated News_, for May, 1881.\r\n\r\nWhilst the deciphering of some of the letters I.H.S.--M.I.A. at the top of\r\nthe inscription has exercised the ingenuity of our Oldbucks and Monkbarns,\r\nthe plate itself and its inscription will furnish to the student of\r\nhistory an indefeasible proof of the exact spot, and of the date, when and\r\nwhere stood the oldest of our seigniorial manors,--that of Robert Gifart,\r\non the margin of the _ruisseau de l'ours_, at Beauport, in 1634.\r\n\r\n    _J.

All these are\r\n    enclosed in a larger heart, point downwards.\r\n\r\n    The enclosed rough simile may give an idea of the lettering at the top\r\n    of the circle, the plate itself being about nine inches in diameter.\"\r\n\r\n    (With Mrs. Gugy's compliments.)\r\n\r\n    Darnoc, 26th March, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _THE BEAUPORT MANOR INSCRIPTION._\r\n\r\n    (To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle.)\r\n\r\n    \"Whilst regretting the loss of the coins and document accompanying the\r\n    inscription of the Beauport Manor, on account of the light it might\r\n    have thrown on this remote incident of Canadian history, let us\r\n    examine the case as it stands.\r\n\r\n    This rude inscription of 25th July, 1634, gives priority as to date to\r\n    the Beauport Manor over any ancient structure extant in Canada this\r\n    day. The erection of the manor would seem to have preceded by three\r\n    years the foundation of the Jesuits' Sillery residence, now owned by\r\n    Messrs. Dobell and Beckett, which dates of July, 1637. Who prepared\r\n    the inscription? Who engraved the letters? Who cut on the lead the\r\n    figure of the \"flaming heart?\" The stars? Are they heraldic? What did\r\n    they typify? Did the plate come out, ready prepared from France? Had\r\n    the _Académie des Inscriptions, etc._, or any other _académie_, any\r\n    hand in the business? No, for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n    The lead-plate was imbedded in solid masonry. It is too rude to be the\r\n    work of an engraver. Could it have been designed by Surgeon Gifart,\r\n    the Laird of Beauport and cut on the lead-plate by the scribe and\r\n    _savant_ of the settlement, Jean Guion (Dion?) whose penmanship\r\n    in the wording of two marriage contracts, dating from 1636, has been\r\n    brought to light by an indefatigable searcher of the past--the Abbé\r\n    Ferland? probably.\r\n\r\n    But if the lettered Beauport stone mason, who never rose to be a Hugh\r\n    Miller, whatever were his abilities, did utilize his talents in 1634,\r\n    to produce a durable record in order to perpetuate the date of\r\n    foundation of this manor, he subsequently got at loggerheads with his\r\n    worth _seignieur_, probably owing to the litigious tastes which\r\n    his native Perche had instilled in him. Perche, we all know, is not\r\n    very distant from Normandy, the hot-bed of feuds and litigation, and\r\n    might have caught the infection from this neighborhood:\r\n\r\n    Governor Montmagny, in the space of eight short years, had been called\r\n    on to adjudicate on six controversies which had arisen between Gifart\r\n    and his vassals, touching boundaries and seigniorial rights, though\r\n    the learned historian Ferland, has failed to particularize, whether\r\n    among those controverted rights, was included the _Droit de Chapons_\r\n    and _Droit de Seigneur_; could the latter unchaste, but cherished\r\n    right of some Scotch and German feudal lords, by a misapprehension of\r\n    our law, in the dark days of the colony, have been claimed by such an\r\n    exacting seignior as M. de Gifart? One hopes not.\r\n\r\n    Be that as it may, the stone mason and _savant_ Jean Guion had refused\r\n    to do feudal homage to \"Monsieur de Beauport,\" and on the 30th July,\r\n    1640, six years after the date of the inscription, under sentence\r\n    rendered by Governor de Montmagny, he was made to do so.\r\n\r\n    Who will decipher the I.H.S.--M.I.A. the letters at the top of the\r\n    plate? Is there no defendant of the haughty Seignior of Beauport, Rob.\r\n    Gifart, to give us his biography, and tell us of his sporting days; of\r\n    the black and grey ducks, brant, widgeon, teal, snipe, and curlew,\r\n    etc., which infested the marshy banks of the stream--the _Ruisseau de\r\n    l'Ours_, on which he had located, first his shooting box, and\r\n    afterwards his little fort or block-house, against Iroquois\r\n    aggression? Dr. Gifart was a keen sportsman, tradition repeats. Did\r\n    the locality get the name of _Canardière_ on account of the _Canards_,\r\n    the ducks, he had bagged in his time? Who will enlighten us on all\r\n    these points?\r\n\r\n    ENQUIRER.\r\n\r\n    Quebec, 8th April, 1881.\r\n\r\n    QUERY.--Would I. H.

Je suis allé, comme bien d'autres, voir\r\n    ce morceau de plomb, qui contient, autant que l'imprimerie peut le\r\n    représenter, l'inscription suivante:\r\n\r\n                           I.H.S.

Impossible de dire si elles sont posées en face ou sur un\r\n    champ quelconque. Le tout a du être surmonté d'un heaume, car on voit\r\n    encore de chaque coté de l'écu des lignes courbes multiples, qui\r\n    doivent nécessairement représenter les lambrequins; sur le côte\r\n    gauche, un bout de banderolle, mais l'_artiste_ a dû abandonner\r\n    sa première idée, car le haut de la banderolle se perd dans les lignes\r\n    du lambrequin.\r\n\r\n    J'ai lu dans la lettre qui accompagnait l'envoi de Madame Gugy, que\r\n    les ouvriers, qui avaient travaille aux ruines, disaient avoir trouve\r\n    la plaque de plomb, _roulée_ avec certains documents qui seraient\r\n    tombés en poussière au toucher. La chose me paraît impossible. Le\r\n    dessous de la plaque indique qu'elle a été posée à plat sur un lit de\r\n    mortier, et la partie gravée, du moins celle où sont gravées les\r\n    armoiries qu'une pierre pesante a été placée dessus, et c'est par\r\n    l'enfoncement de sa surface inégale que la plupart des lignes gravées\r\n    ont été détruites. On voit encore dans le plomb oxidé l'empreinte\r\n    d'une coquille pétrifiée qui se trouvait agrégée au calcaire.\r\n\r\n    En roulant le bloc supérieur, les ouvriers ont pu plier le métal; de\r\n    là l'erreur de croire que la plaque était roulée, elle a dû, comme\r\n    toutes choses de ce genre, être placée dans une cavité comme fond, où\r\n    on avait deposé le document tombé en poussière et les \"quelques sous\"\r\n    que ces honnêtes ouvriers ont gardés pour eux, sans doute, sans en\r\n    connaître la valeur.\r\n\r\n    Peu habitué à lire de telles inscriptions, mais connaissant la piété\r\n    des premiers colons du Canada, j'essayai de donner un sens courant à\r\n    l'inscription et je trouvai qu'on pouvait lire ici:\r\n\r\n             _Iesu Hominum Salvatore, Mariâ Immaculatâ Auspice_\r\n\r\n    (Sous les auspices ou la protection de Jesus sauveur des hommes et de\r\n    Marie-Immaculée)\r\n\r\n                             L'an 1634,\r\n                   le 25 juillet--je--été plantée\r\n      première par (ou pour) C. (chirur.) Gifart, Seigneur de ce lieu.\r\n\r\n    Jusqu'à présent la chose se lit bien, le sens en est raisonnable et\r\n    positif. Supposant le chirurgien un homme instruit et lettré,\r\n    l'inscription latine se complète d'elle-même. Mais, hélas! il y un\r\n    mais,--la lettre C avant Gifart me trouble un peu. Comme je n'ai sous\r\n    la main aucun volume, aucune tradition du temps à consulter, je suis\r\n    obligé de m'en tenir aux correspondances de journaux, et je trouve\r\n    dans toutes le prénom de _Robert_--ce qui ne commence pas du tout\r\n    par un C! [299] Mais le C, le malheureux C, ne serait-il pas\r\n    l'initiale de Cloutier, le charpentier ou l'entrepreneur avec lequel\r\n    Gifart avait fait un contrat à Mortaigne, le 14 mars 1634, quatre mois\r\n    à peu près avant la pose de la première pierre? Alors il faudrait lire\r\n    j'ai été plantée par Cloutier, Gifart étant seigneur de ce lieu.\r\n\r\n    Je m'arrête, le souvenir de _certaine_ inscription sur certain\r\n    _pont_ vient troubler toutes ces belles spéculations. A force de\r\n    vouloir être _savant_, on pourrait faire dire à Robert Gifart des\r\n    choses qu'il n'a jamais pensées.\r\n\r\n    Si, après tout, ce Gifart n'était pas _savant_, et qu'il eut voulu\r\n    dire par I. H. S., Jésus-Christ, et M. I. A., Maria, ce serait trop\r\n    fort--J'aimerais mieux la théorie de M. le Dr. Marsden, et de M.\r\n    Bédard, _Maria, Joachim, Anna_. Le 25 juillet étant la fête de\r\n    saint Jacques, et la vigile de saint Joachim, il serait plus\r\n    raisonnable de penser qu'on aurait mis la construction du premier\r\n    Manoir canadien sous la protection et les auspices du saint du jour\r\n\r\n    Reste a savoir si la Saint Jacques se fêtait le 25 juillet, la Saint\r\n    Joachim le 26, en l'an de notre Seigneur 1634.\r\n\r\n    Je laisse à d'autres de mieux trouver.\r\n\r\n    Quoiqu'il en soit, cette date 1634, est un centenaire mémorable, car\r\n    c'est en 1534 que Jacques Cartier, visita le golfe Saint-Laurent et\r\n    c'est en 1535, qu'il remonta notre beau fleuve jusqu'à Hochelaga, cent\r\n    ans avant la première concession seigneuriale de Beauport.\r\n\r\n    J'ai l'honneur d'être, Monsieur,\r\n    votre humble servt.,\r\n      Cte. d'ORSONNENS\r\n\r\n\r\n    L'INSCRIPTION DU MANOIR DE BEAUPORT.\r\n\r\n    Parmi une masse de vieux documents que je possède, concernant la\r\n    seigneurie de Beauport et ses seigneurs, j'ai trouve le reçu suivant:\r\n\r\n    \"Je, soussigné, confesse avoir reçu un billet de cent cinquante livres\r\n    de monsieur de Beauport, pour ce qu'il m'avait promis pour faire sa\r\n    bâtisse de logis de Beauport.\r\n\r\n    \"faict ce 27ième juillet 1642.\r\n\r\n      \"P. CLUST.\"\r\n\r\n    Cela donnerait peut-être une explication des abréviations \"P. C.\" de\r\n    l'inscription trouvée dans les ruines du vieux manoir.\r\n\r\n    En effet, il est loisible de supposer que cet architecte a fait ce que\r\n    ses confrères modernes font encore, et qu'il a gravé ses initiales sur\r\n    l'inscription commémorative de la pose de la première pierre\r\n    _plantée dans la bâtisse de Beauport_.\r\n\r\n      H. J. J. DUCHESNAY.\r\n\r\n     La Beauce, 14 avril, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _H. V'S LETTER._\r\n\r\n    (ABBÉ H. VERREAU?)\r\n\r\n    _Une relique historique_.\r\n\r\n    La _Minerve_ a publié l'inscription de la plaque trouvée à Beauport.\r\n    Le _Journal de Québec_ l'a reproduite aussi; mais avec une certaine\r\n    différence. Pour l'étude des personnes éloignées et pour l'utilité de\r\n    la science, il est bien désirable qu'on en prenne de nombreuses\r\n    impressions sur plâtre. Si madame Gugy accorde la permission\r\n    nécessaire, elle méritera certainement la reconnaissance de ceux qui\r\n    étudient notre histoire.\r\n\r\n    Il paraît que le dernier chiffre de la date se lit avec difficulté. Il\r\n    est toutefois très important de le déterminer avec toute la précision\r\n    possible.\r\n\r\n    A mes yeux, la date du 25 juillet entraîne plusieurs conséquences qui\r\n    disparaissent avec un autre chiffre.\r\n\r\n    I. Le 25 juillet est consacré à l'apôtre saint Jacques-le-Majeur. Ne\r\n    peut-on pas traduire le second groupe trilittère M. J. A. par\r\n    _Majori Jacobo Apostolo_, Le premier groupe, si connu d'ailleurs,\r\n    étant latin, il est naturel de supposer que le second l'est aussi.\r\n\r\n    II. La fête de saint Jacques-le-Majeur, qui tombait un mardi en 1634,\r\n    était chômée; par conséquent les travaux serviles ont dû être suspendu\r\n    ce jour-là.\r\n\r\n    III. Le même jour, 25 juillet 1634, Robert Gifart assistait à un\r\n    mariage à Québec, ce qui peut expliquer pourquoi il était remplacé à\r\n    Beauport par son fils Charles.\r\n\r\n    Mais la pose de la pierre angulaire d'une simple maison, un jour de\r\n    grande fête, me semble difficile à expliquer, qu'on veuille ou non y\r\n    faire intervenir les cérémonies de la Religion.\r\n\r\n    L'expression _Je été plantée_ offre aussi une difficulté. A cette\r\n    époque on faisait de nombreuses fautes d'orthographe, mais on avait\r\n    presque toujours le mot propre.\r\n\r\n    Il est bien vrai qu'en terme d'architecture, on disait _planter un\r\n    édifice_ pour l'_asseoir sur la maçonnerie de ses fondements_, mais je\r\n    ne sache pas qu'on ait dit _planter_ les pierres des fondements.\r\n\r\n    Cette plaque n'aurait-elle pas été destinée à une croix plantée à\r\n    l'endroit que Giffard voulait défricher?\r\n\r\n    Il est d'autant plus naturel qu'il ait commencé ses travaux par cet\r\n    acte de foi qu'il devait songer à faire bâtir une église près de sa\r\n    demeure. Dans cette supposition, on s'explique facilement que la croix\r\n    ait été plantée un jour de fête solennelle où tout le monde surtout à\r\n    cette époque, devait vaquer à ses devoirs religieux. Je vois dans les\r\n    _Archives_ de Beauport par Mgr. Langevin que la maison de Giffard,\r\n    d'après M. Ferland, devait être plus près de la petite rivière que le\r\n    manoir actuel.\r\n\r\n    C. Giffard, qui est désigné comme seigneur de Beauport, est le fils de\r\n    Robert. Il était né en France et devait être encore assez jeune. C'est\r\n    de lui que parle le _Journal_ des Jésuites en disant que le fils\r\n    de M. Giffard passa en France en 1646, avec d'autres jeunes gens 'tous\r\n    fripons pour la plupart qui avait fait mille pièces à l'autre voyage\r\n    et on donnait à tous de grands appointements.'\r\n\r\n    Ce 28 octobre il était parrain, et il s'embarquait le 31.\r\n\r\n    Il n'est plus question de lui après cette date, soit qu'il ait renoncé\r\n    au Canada, soit qu'il ait péri prématurément. Le père repris sa\r\n    seigneurie de Beauport qu'il fit agrandir le mieux put.\r\n\r\n    P. S.--En écrivant ce qui précède, j'étais un peu pressé; j'aurais dû\r\n    remarquer cependant que sous la lettre C, les lecteurs ne pouvaient\r\n    deviner le prénom du jeune seigneur de Beauport. Il s'appelait\r\n    _Charles_, et devait être né en France comme sa soeur _Marie_, qui\r\n    devint Madame de la Ferté.\r\n\r\n    Dans l'intérêt de vos lecteurs je ferai remarquer que le _Dictionnaire\r\n    Généalogique_ renferme, à l'article Giffard, certaines erreurs. Ainsi,\r\n    _Françoise_ qui commence l'article est la même que _Marie Françoise_\r\n    qui le termine; elle se fit religieuse à l'Hôtel-Dieu. L'épouse de\r\n    _Jean Juchereau de la Ferté_ fut _Marie_ née en France, puisque son\r\n    contrat de mariage en 1645 la dite \"âgée de 17 ans environ\" ce qui\r\n    reporte sa naissance vers 1628. Charles assiste et signe un contrat.\r\n    Ce n'est pas _Robert Giffard_, mais son fils _Joseph_, dont le corps\r\n    fut transporté à la cathédrale, le 31 décembre 1705.\r\n\r\n\r\n_MOUNT LILAC, BEAUPORT._\r\n\r\nSome thirty years ago, I saw, for the first time, the picturesque old\r\nmanor of the Rylands at Beauport, this was in its classic days. Later on,\r\nI viewed it, mossy and forlorn, in what some might style its \"non age\". Of\r\nthis, hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe _Château_ stood embowered amidst lilac groves and other ornamental\r\nshrubs, so far as I can recollect, with a background of elms, white birch,\r\nspruce, &c. Its vaulted, lofty and well-proportioned dining-room, with\r\nantique, morocco-covered chairs, and carved _buffets_ to store massive\r\nplate, its spacious hall and graceful winding staircase, its commanding\r\nposition on the crest of the Beauport ridge, affording a striking view of\r\nQuebec, its well-stocked orchard, umbrageous plantations, and ample\r\nstables, from which issued, among other choice bits of blood, in 1842, the\r\ncelebrated racer \"Emigrant\": several circumstances, in fact, conspired to\r\nimpress it favorably on my youthful mind. On that occasion, I found _le\r\nmilord anglais_ (as a waggish Canadian peasant called him) under his\r\nancestral roof.\r\n\r\nRecalling our parish annals of early times, I used then to think that\r\nshould England ever (which God forbid) hand back to its ancient masters\r\n\"these fifteen thousand acres of snow,\" satirized by Voltaire, ridiculed\r\nby Madame de Pompadour, cruelly and basely deserted by Louis XV, in their\r\nhour of trial, here existed a ready-made manor for the Giffards and\r\nDuchesnays of the future, where their descendants could becomingly receive\r\nfealty and homage. (_foi et homage_) from their feudal retainers. There\r\nwas, however, nothing here to remind one of the lordly pageantry of other\r\ntimes--the days of absolutism--of the dark era, the age of _lettres de\r\ncachet_, _corvées_, _lods et ventes_, and other feudal burthens, when the\r\nflag of the Bourbons floated over the fortress of New France. In 1846, at\r\nthe time of my visit, in vain would you have sought in the farm yard for a\r\nlive seigniorial capon (_un chapon vif et en plumes_) though possibly in\r\nthe larder, at Christmas, you might have discovered some fat, tender\r\nturkeys, or a juicy haunch of venison. Of _vin ordinaire_ ne'er a trace,\r\nbut judging from the samples on the table, perhaps much mellow Madeira,\r\nand \"London Stout\" might have been stored in the cellars. Everywhere, in\r\nfact, was apparent English comfort, English cheer. On the walls of the\r\nbanqueting apartment, or within the antique red-leathered portfolios\r\nstrewn round, you would have run a greater chance of meeting face to face\r\nwith the portraits of Lord Dorchester, Genl. Prescott, Sir Robert Shore\r\nMilnes, Sir James Craig, the Duke of Richmond, and other English\r\nGovernors, the cherished friends of the Rylands than with the powdered\r\nhead of his most sacred Majesty, the Great Louis, or the ruffled bust and\r\nsensual countenance of the voluptuous Louis XV.... But let us see more of\r\nMount Lilac and its present belongings.\r\n\r\nFacing the glittering cupolas of Quebec, there is a fertile area of meadow\r\nand cornfield stretching from Dorchester bridge to the deep ravine and\r\nFalls over which the Montmorency, _La Vache_, hangs its milk-white\r\ncurtain of spray. On the river shore, in 1759, stood Montcalm's earth and\r\nfield works of defence. Parallel to them and distant about half a mile,\r\nthe highway, over which H.R.H. Prince Edward's equipage pranced daily,\r\nduring the summers of 1791-3, now a macadamized road, ascends by a gentle\r\nrise, through a double row of whitewashed cottages, about seven miles, to\r\nthe brow of the roaring cataract spanned over by a substantial bridge,\r\nhalf way, looms out the Roman Catholic temple of worship--a stately\r\nedifice, filled to overflowing on Sundays, the parochial charge in 1841 of\r\nthe Rev. Charles Chiniquy, under whose auspices was built the Temperance\r\nMonument on the main road, a little past the Beauport Asylum. This\r\nconstitutes the parish of Beauport, one of the first settled in the\r\nProvince. It was conceded by the Company of New France, on the 31st\r\nDecember, 1635, to a French surgeon of some note, \"le sieur Robert\r\nGiffard.\" Surgeon Giffard had not only skill as a chirurgeon to recommend\r\nhim, he could plead services, nay captivity undergone in the colonial\r\ncause. An important man in his day was this feudal magnate Giffard, to\r\nwhom fealty and homage were rendered with becoming pomp, by his\r\n_consitaires_, the Bellangers--Guions--Langlois--Parents--Marcoux, of\r\n1635, whose descendents, still bearing the old Perche or Norman name,\r\noccupy to this day the white cottages to be seen on all sides.\r\n\r\nOn the highest site of this limestone ridge, a clever, influential,\r\nrefined, and wealthy Briton, the Hon. Henry Wistius Ryland, for years\r\nCivil Secretary, Clerk of the Executive Council, a member of the\r\nLegislative Council, with other appointments, purchased from Col.\r\nJohnston, a lot, then a wilderness, for a country seat in 1805. Mr. Ryland\r\nhad come out to Canada with Lord Dorchester in 1795, as his secretary, at\r\nthe instance, we believe, of Lord Liverpool, his protector, at the age of\r\n21 he was acting as Paymaster of two army corps, during the War of\r\nIndependence in America.\r\n\r\nFor more than thirty years, Mr. Ryland enjoyed the favour, nay the\r\nintimacy of every ruler (except Sir George Prevost) which this then mis-\r\nruled colony owed to Downing Street.\r\n\r\nAntipathies of race had been on the increase at Quebec, ever since the\r\nparliamentary era of 1791; there was the French party, [300] led by fiery\r\nand able politicians, and the English oligarchy occupying nearly all the\r\noffices, and avenues to power. French armies under Napoleon I. swayed the\r\ndestinies of continental Europe, their victories occasionally must have\r\nawakened here a responsive echo among their down-trodden fellow-countrymen\r\ncowardly deserted by France in 1759, whilst Nelson's victories of the\r\nNile, of Trafalgar, of Copenhagen, and finally the field of Waterloo, had\r\nbuoyed up to an extravagant pitch the spirits of the English minority of\r\nQuebec, which a French parliamentary majority had so often trammelled. It\r\nwas during the major part of that stormy period that Hon. Herman Wistius\r\nRyland, advised by the able Chief Justice Jonathan Sewell,--was in reality\r\nentrusted with the helm of state. He was, as Christie the historian\r\nobserves, considered the \"Fountain head of power.\" This subtle _diplomat_\r\n(for such will be his title in history), however hostile in his attitude\r\nhe might have appeared towards the French Canadian nationality, succeeded\r\nin retaining to the last the respect of the French Canadian peasantry who\r\nsurrounded him.\r\n\r\nProbably never at any time did he wield more power than under the\r\nadministration of Sir James H. Craig. His views were so much in unison\r\nwith those of Sir James, that His Excellency deputed him to England with a\r\npublic mission threefold in its scope, the ostensible object of which was\r\nfirst \"to endeavor to get the Imperial Government to amend or suspend the\r\nConstitution; secondly, to render the Government independent of the\r\npeople, by appropriating towards it the revenues accruing from the estates\r\nof the Sulpicians [301] of Montreal, and of the Order of the Jesuits;\r\nthirdly to seize the patronage exercised by the Roman Catholic Bishop of\r\nQuebec,--the _cures_ or church livings in his diocese; contending that no\r\nRoman Catholic Bishop really existed in Canada, (but merely a\r\nsuperintendent of _curés_), none having been recognized by the Crown.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that he had a fair chance of succeeding on two points,\r\nhad not the great Lord Chancellor, Eldon, intervened to thwart his scheme.\r\nThe correspondence exchanged between Mr. Ryland and His Excellency, Sir\r\nJames H. Craig, preserved in the sixth volume of Christie's _History of\r\nCanada_, exhibits Mr. Ryland at his best, and has led some to infer\r\nthat, had he been cast in a different sphere, where his talents and\r\nattainments would have been more properly appreciated and directed, he\r\nwould have played a very conspicuous part. \"We find the Beauport statesman\r\nin 1810, in London, [302] consulted on Canadian affairs by the leading\r\nEnglish politicians and some of the proudest peers. The honored guest of\r\nEnglish noblemen, [303] he appears at no disadvantage, sips their old port\r\nunawed, cosily seated at their mahogany. It must be borne in mind that, in\r\n1810, Lord Castlereagh and Lord Liverpool had their hands pretty full with\r\ncontinental politics, perhaps too much so, to heed poor distant Canada.\r\n\r\nShortly after the arrival, at Quebec, of the Earl of Durham, viz., on the\r\n29th July, 1838, the Hon. H. W. Ryland expired at his country seat at\r\nBeauport, aged 78 years. He was born in 1760 at Northampton in England, of\r\na very ancient Saxon family, dating back to Edward the Confessor. Wm.\r\nRyland his great grandfather having successfully defended Oxford against\r\nOliver Cromwell, while his sons fought on the other side.\r\n\r\nMount Lilac then reverted to his son, George Herman Ryland, Esq., now\r\nRegistrar at Montreal, who added much to the charms of the spot. It was\r\noffered to Lord Metcalfe subsequently as a country seat, but for reasons\r\nwhich it is unnecessary to enter into, the negotiations fell through. Mr.\r\nRyland occupied it till his removal from the Quebec to the Montreal\r\nRegistry, Office. Some years back the property was purchased by Mr. James\r\nDinning, Quebec, who reserved for himself the farm, one hundred and five\r\nacres in extent, and sold in 1856, the house and twenty-three acres\r\nthereunto attached to a wealthy and whimsical old ironfounder of Quebec,\r\nMr. John H. Galbraith. This thrifty tradesman, in order to keep his hand\r\nin order, like Thackeray's hero, continued the pursuit of his former\r\noccupation, the smelting of ore, even under the perfumed groves of Mount\r\nLilac, and erected there an extensive grapery and conservatory, and a\r\nfoundry as well; the same furnace blast thus served to produce, under\r\nglass, fragrant flowers--exquisite grapes--melting peaches, as well as\r\nsolid pig iron and first class stove plates.\r\n\r\nMount Lilac owed a divided allegiance to Vulcan and Flora. Which of the\r\nhome products pleased, the most the worthy Mr. Galbraith? is still an open\r\nquestion. [304]\r\n\r\n\r\n_A VISIT TO THE INDIAN LORETTE._\r\n\r\nOf the many attractive sites in the environs of the city, few contain in a\r\ngreater degree than the Huron village of Lorette during the leafy months\r\nof June, July and September, picturesque scenery, combined with a wealth\r\nof historical associations. The nine miles intervening between Quebec and\r\nthe rustic _auberge_ of the village, thanks to an excellent turnpike,\r\ncan be spanned in little more than an hour. I shall now attempt to\r\nrecapitulate some of the sights and incidents of travel which recently\r\nbefell me, whilst escorting to Lorette an Old World tourist, of very high\r\nliterary estate.\r\n\r\nWith a mellow autumnal sun, just sufficient to bronze the sombre tints,\r\nlingering at the close of the Indian summer, we left the St. Louis Hotel,\r\nthe headquarters of tourists, and rapidly drove through _Fabrique_ and\r\nPalace streets, towards the unsightly gap in our city walls, of yore\r\nyclept Palace Gate, which all Lord Dufferin's _prestige_ failed to protect\r\nagainst vandalism, but which, thanks to his initiative, we expect yet to\r\nsee _bridged over_ with, graceful turrets and Norman towers.\r\n\r\nA turn to the west brought us opposite to the scarcely perceptible ruins\r\nof the Palace [305] of the French Intendants, destroyed by the English\r\nshells in 1775, to dislodge Arnold and Montgomery's New England soldiery.\r\n\r\nThe park which intervened formerly between it and the St. Charles was many\r\nyears back converted into a wood yard to store the fuel for the garrison,\r\na portion now is used as a cattle market, opposite, stands the station and\r\nfreight sheds of the Q. M. O. & O. Railway, the road skirts the park\r\ntowards the populous St. Roch suburbs, rebuilt and transformed since the\r\ngreat fire of the 28th May, 1845, which destroyed 1,600 houses, occupying\r\nthe site of former spacious pasture grounds for the city cows, styled by\r\nthe early French _La Vacherie_. In a trice we reach Dorchester bridge, the\r\nsecond one, built there in 1822, the first, opened with great pomp by His\r\nExcellency Lord Dorchester in 1789, having been constructed a few acres to\r\nthe west, and called after him. The bridge, as a means of crossing from\r\none shore to the other, is an undoubted improvement on the scow used up to\r\n1789.\r\n\r\nOne of the first objects on quitting the bridge and diverging westward to\r\nthe Charlesbourg road, on the river bank, is the stately, solid, antique\r\nmansion of the late C. Smith, Esq, who at one time owned nearly all the\r\nbroad acres intervening between the house and _Gros Pin_. It took for\r\na time the name of Smithville and was inherited by several members of his\r\nfamily, who built cosy houses round it. These green fields, fringed with\r\nwhite birch and spruce plantations, are watered by the St. Charles, the\r\n_Kahir-Koubat_ [306] of ancient days. In rear of one of the first villas\r\n_Ringfield_, owned by Geo. Holmes Parke, Esq., runs the diminutive stream,\r\nthe _Lairet_, at the confluence of which Jacques Cartier wintered in 1535-\r\n6, leaving, there one of his ships, the _Petite-Hermine_, of 60 tons,\r\nwhose decayed oak timbers were exhumed in 1843, by Jos. Hamel, City\r\nSurveyor of Quebec. A very remarkable vestige of French domination exists\r\nbehind the villa of Mr. Parke--a circular field (hence the name Ring-\r\nfield) covering about twelve acres, surrounded by a ditch, with an earth\r\nwork about twenty feet high, to the east, to shield its inmates from the\r\nshot of Wolfe's fleet lying at the entrance of the St. Charles, before\r\nQuebec. A minute description has been given by General Levi's aide-de-\r\ncamp, the _Chevalier_ Johnstone, [307] of what was going on in this\r\nearthwork, where at noon, on the 13th Sept., 1759, were mustered the\r\ndisorganized French squadrons in full retreat from the Plains of Abraham\r\ntoward their camp at Beauport. Here, on that fatal day, was debated the\r\nsurrender of the colony--the close of French rule: here also, close by, in\r\n1535-6, was the cradle of French power, the first settlement and winter\r\nquarters of the French pioneers--Jacques Cartier's hardy little band.\r\n\r\nFrom this spot, at eight o'clock that night (13th Sept.), began the French\r\nretreat towards the Charlesbourg church; at 4 a.m. next day the army was\r\nat Cap Rouge, disordered, panic-stricken! Oh! where was the heroic Levi!\r\n\r\nOn ascending a hill (Clearihue's) to the north, the eye gathers in the\r\ncontour of a dense grove, hiding in its drooping folds \"Auvergne,\" the\r\nformer secluded country seat of Chief Justice Jonathan Sewell, now owned\r\nby George Alford, Esq.\r\n\r\nA mile to the north, in the deep recesses of Bourg-Royal, rest the fast\r\ncrumbling and now insignificant ruins of the only rural _Château_ of\r\nFrench origin round Quebec. Was it built by Talon, or by Bigot? an\r\nunfathomable mystery. Silence and desertion reign supreme, where of yore\r\nBigot's heartless wassailers used to meet and gamble away King Louis's\r\ncard money and _piastres_.\r\n\r\n  \"And sunk are the voices that sounded in mirth.\r\n  And empty the goblets and dreary the hearth!\"\r\n\r\nThe tower or boudoir, where was immured the Algonquin maid Caroline, the\r\nbeautiful, that too has crumbled to dust.\r\n\r\nWe are now at Lorette.\r\n\r\n\r\n_TAHOURENCHE._\r\n\r\n  \"I'm the chieftain of this mountain,\r\n  Times and seasons found me here,\r\n  My drink has been the crystal fountain,\r\n  My fare the wild moose or the deer.\"\r\n                    (_The_ HURON CHIEF, _by Adam Kidd_).\r\n\r\nThere exists a faithful portrait of this noble savage, such as drawn by\r\nhimself and presented, we believe, to the Laval University at Quebec; for\r\nglimpses of his origin, home and surroundings, we are indebted to an\r\nhonorary chief of the tribe, Ahatsistari. [308]\r\n\r\nPaul _Tahourenché_ (François Xavier Picard), Great Chief of the Lorette\r\nHurons, was born at Indian Lorette in 1810; he is consequently at present\r\n71 years of age. He is tall, erect, well proportioned, dignified in face\r\nand deportment; when habited in his Indian regalia: blue frock coat, with\r\nbright buttons and medals, plumed fur cap, leggings of colored cloth,\r\nbright sash and armlets, with war axe, he looks the _beau ideal_ of a\r\nrespectable Huron warrior, shorn of the ferocity of other days. Of the\r\nline of Huron chiefs which proceeded him we can furnish but a very meagre\r\nhistory. Adam Kidd, who wrote a poem entitled the _Huron Chief_ in 1829,\r\nand who paid that year a visit to the Lorette Indians and saw their oldest\r\nchief, _Oui-a-ra-lih-to_, having unfortunately failed to fulfil the\r\npromise he then made of publishing the traditions and legends of the tribe\r\nfurnished him on that occasion, an omission which, we hope, will yet be\r\nsupplied by an educated Huron; the Revd. Mr. Vincent. Of _Oui-a-ra-lih-\r\nto_, we learn from Mr. Kidd: \"This venerable patriarch, who is now (in\r\n1829) approaching the precincts of a century, is the grandson of _Tsa-a-\r\nra-lih-to_, head chief of the Hurons during the war of 1759. _Oui-a-ra-\r\nlih-to_, with about thirty-five warriors of the Indian village of Lorette\r\nin conjunction with the Iroquois and Algonquins, was actually engaged in\r\nthe army of Burgoyne, a name unworthy to be associated with the noble\r\nspirit of Indian heroism. During my visit to this old chief--May, 1829--he\r\nwillingly furnished me with an account of the distinguished warriors, and\r\nthe traditions of different tribes, which are still fresh in his memory,\r\nand are handed from father to son, with the precision, interest and\r\nadmiration that the tales and exploits of Ossian and his heroes are\r\ncirculated in their original purity to this day among the Irish.\" Mr. Kidd\r\nalludes also to another great chief, _Atsistari_, who flourished in 1637,\r\nand who may have been the same as the Huron Saul _Ahatsistari_, who lived\r\nin 1642.\r\n\r\nOf the powerful tribes of the aborigines who, in remote periods, infested\r\nthe forests, lakes and streams of Canada, none by their prowess in war,\r\nwisdom in council, success as tillers of the soil, intelligent and lofty\r\nbearing, surpassed the Wyandats, or Hurons. [309] They numbered 15,000\r\nsouls, according to the historian Ferland, 40,000 according to Bouchette,\r\nand chiefly inhabited the country bordering on Lake Huron and Simcoe; they\r\nmight, says Sagard, have been styled the \"nobles\" among savages in\r\ncontradistinction to that other powerful confederacy, more democratic in\r\ntheir ways, also speaking the Huron language, and known as the Five\r\nNations (Mohawks,[310] Oneydoes, Onondagas, Cayugas and Senecas), styled\r\nby the French the Iroquois, or Hiroquois, from the habit of their orators\r\nof closing their orations with the word \"Hiro\"--_I have said_.\r\n\r\n'Tis a curious fact that the aborigines whom Jacques Cartier had found\r\nmasters of the soil, at Hochelaga (Montreal,) and Stadacona (Quebec,) in\r\n1535, sixty-eight years later on, in 1603, when Champlain visited these\r\nIndian towns, had disappeared: a different race had succeeded them. Though\r\nit opens a wide field to conjecture, recent investigations seem to\r\nindicate that it was the Huron-Iroquois nation who, in 1535, were the\r\n_enfants du sol_ at both places, and that in the interim the Algonquins\r\nhad, after bloody wars, dispersed and expelled the Huron-Iroquois. The\r\nsavages with whom the early French settlers held intercourse can be\r\ncomprised under two specific heads--the Algonquins and the Huron-Iroquois\r\n--the language of each differing as much, observes the learned Abbé\r\nFaillon, as French does from Chinese.\r\n\r\nIt would take us beyond the limit of this sketch to recapitulate the\r\nseries of massacres which reduced these warlike savages, the Hurons, from\r\ntheir high estate to that of a dispersed, nomadic tribe, and placed the\r\nIroquois or Mohawks, at one time nearly destroyed by the Hurons, in the\r\nascendant.\r\n\r\nTheir final overthrow may be said to date back to the great Indian\r\nmassacres of 1648-9, at their towns, or missions, on the shores of Lakes\r\nSimcoe, the first mission being founded in 1615 by the Friar LeCaron,\r\naccompanied by twelve soldiers sent by Champlain in advance of his own\r\nparty. The Jesuit mission was attacked by the Iroquois in 1648; St. Louis,\r\nSt. Joseph [311], St. Ignace [312], Ste. Marie [313], St. Jean [314],\r\nsuccessively fell, or were threatened; all the inmates who escaped sought\r\nsafety in flight; the protracted sufferings of the missionaries Bréboeuf\r\nand Gabriel Lallemant have furnished one of the brightest pages of\r\nChristian heroism in New France. Bréboeuf expired on the 16th March and\r\nLallemant on 17th March, 1649. A party of Hurons sought Manitoulin Island,\r\nthen called Ekaentoton, a few fled to Virginia; others succeeded in\r\nobtaining protection on the south shore of Lake Erie, from the Erie tribe,\r\nonly to share, later on, the dire fate of the nation who had dared to\r\nincorporate them in its sparse ranks.\r\n\r\nFather P. Ragueneau (the first writer, by the by, who makes mention of\r\nNiagara Falls--_Relations de_ 1648,) escorted three or four hundred\r\nof these terror-stricken people to Quebec on the 26th July, 1650, and\r\nlodged them in the Island of Orleans, at a spot since called _L'Anse du\r\nFort_, where they were joined, in 1651, by a party of Hurons, who in\r\n1649, on hearing of the massacre of their western brethren, had asked to\r\nwinter at Quebec. For ten years past a group of Algonquins, Montagnais and\r\nHurons, amidst incessant alarms, had been located in the picturesque\r\nparish of Sillery; they, too, were in quest of a more secure asylum.\r\nNegotiations were soon entered into between them and their persecuted\r\nfriends of the West; a plan was put forth to combine. On the 29th March,\r\n1651, the Sillery Indians, many of whom were Hurons united with the\r\nwestern brethren, sought a shelter, though a very insecure one, in a\r\nfortified nook, adjoining their missionary's house, on the land of\r\nEléonore de Grandmaison, purchased for them at _l'Anse du Fort_, in\r\nthe Island of Orleans, on the south side of the point opposite Quebec.\r\nHere they set to tilling the soil with some success, cultivating chiefly\r\nIndian corn, their numbers being occasionally increased during the year\r\n1650, by their fugitive brethren of the West, until they counted above 600\r\nsouls. Even under the guns of the picket Fort of Orleans, which had\r\nchanged its name to Ile St. Marie, in remembrance of their former\r\nresidency, the tomahawk and scalping-knife reached them; on the 20th May,\r\n1656, eighty-six of their number were carried away captives, and six\r\nkilled, by the ferocious Iroquois; and on the 4th June, 1656, again they\r\nhad to fly before their merciless tormentors. The big guns of Fort St.\r\nLouis, which then stood at the north-west extremity of the spot on which\r\nthe Dufferin Terrace has lately been erected, seemed to the Hurons a more\r\neffectual protection than the howitzers of _Anse du Fort_, so they\r\nbegged from Governor d'Aillebout for leave to nestle under them in 1658.\r\n'Twas granted. When the Marquis de Tracy had arranged a truce with the\r\nIroquois in 1665, the Huron refugees prepared to bid adieu to city life\r\nand to city dust. Two years later we find them ensconced at Beauport,\r\nwhere others had squatted on land belonging to the Jesuits; they stopped\r\nthere one year, and suddenly left, in 1669, to pitch their wigwams for a\r\nfew years at Côte St. Michel, four and a half miles from Quebec, at the\r\nMission of Notre Dame de Foye, now called St. Foye. On the 29th December,\r\n1673, restless and alarmed, the helpless sons of the forest sought the\r\nseclusion, leafy shades and green fields _Ancienne Lorette_. [315]\r\nHere they dwelled nearly twenty-five years. The youths had grown up to\r\nmanhood, with the terrible memories of the past still fresh on their\r\nminds. One fine day, allured by hopes of more abundant game, they packed\r\nup their household gods, and finally, in 1697, they went and settled on\r\nthe elevated _plateau_, close to the foaming rapids of St. Ambroise,\r\nnow known as Indian, or _Jeune_, Lorette.\r\n\r\n\"Tis here we shall now find them, 336 souls all told, [316] living in\r\ncomparative ease, successful traders, exemplary Christians, but fast\r\ndecaying Hurons.\r\n\r\n\"The Hurons,\" says Ahatsistari, [317] \"are divided into four families:\r\nthat of the _Deer_; of the _Tortoise_; of the _Bear_; of the _Wolf_. Thus,\r\nthe great Chief François Xavier Picard--Tahourenché--is a _Deer_, and his\r\nson Paul is a _Tortoise_, because (Her Highness) Madame _Tahourenché_ is a\r\n_Tortoise_; a lithe, handsome woman for all that.\r\n\r\n\"Each family has its chief, or war captain; he is elected by choice. The\r\nfour war captains chose two council chiefs, the six united select a grand\r\nchief, either from among themselves or from among the honorary chiefs, if\r\nthey think proper.\"\r\n\r\nWe append a letter, from Sister Ste. Helene, descriptive of Indian\r\ncustoms, in 1730. Civilization and Christianity have sensibly modified,\r\nsome will say, improved the Red Skins since then.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _INDIAN DRESS--LOVE MAKING-FEASTSBURIALS._\r\n\r\n    From a MS. Letter of _Soeur Ste. Hélène_, published by Abbé Verrault.\r\n\r\n    \"Would you like to learn how they dress--how they marry--how they are\r\n    buried? First, you must know that several tribes go completely naked,\r\n    and wear but the fig-leaf. In Montreal, you meet many stately and\r\n    well-proportioned savages, walking about in this state of nudity, as\r\n    proud in their bearing, as if they wore good clothes. Some have on a\r\n    shirt only; others have a covering negligently thrown over one\r\n    shoulder. Christianized Indians are differently habited. The Iroquois\r\n    put their shirt over their wearing apparel, and over the shirt another\r\n    raiment, which encloses a portion of the head, which is always bare.\r\n    The men generally wear garments over their shirts; the latter, when\r\n    new, is generally very white, but is used until it gets perfectly dark\r\n    and disgustingly greasy. They sometimes shave a portion of their head,\r\n    or else they comb one half of their hair back, the other half front.\r\n    They occasionally tie up a tuft of hair very tight on the top of the\r\n    head, rising towards the skies. At other times some allow a long tress\r\n    of hair to fall over their face: it interferes with their eating, but\r\n    it has to be put up with. They smear their ears with a white\r\n    substance, or their face with blue, vermillion and black. They are\r\n    more elaborate in their war-toilette than a coquette would be in\r\n    dressing--in order to conceal the paleness which fear might engender.\r\n    They are profuse of gold and silver brocade, porcelain necklaces,\r\n    bracelets of beads--the women, especially in their youth. This is\r\n    their jewellery, their diamonds, the value whereof sometimes reaches\r\n    1,000 francs. The Abenaqis enclose their heads in a small cap\r\n    embroidered with beads or ornamented with brocade. They wrap their\r\n    legs in leggings with a fringe three or four inches long. Their shoes\r\n    consist of socks, with plaits round the toe, covering the foot. All\r\n    this has its charm in their eyes; they are as vain of dress as any\r\n    Frenchman. The pagan tribes, whenever love is felt, marry without any\r\n    ceremonial. The pair will discover whether they love one another in\r\n    silence, Indian-like. One of the caresses consists in throwing to the\r\n    loved one a small pebble, or grains of Indian corn, or else some other\r\n    object which cannot hurt. The swain, on throwing the pebble, is bound\r\n    to look in the opposite direction, to make believe he did not do it.\r\n    Should the adored one return it, matters look well, else, the game is\r\n    up.\r\n\r\n    \"The Christianized Indians are married in face of the church, without\r\n    any contract of marriage and without stipulations, because an Indian\r\n    cannot own real estate and cannot bequeath to his children. The\r\n    wealthiest is the mightiest hunter. This favored individual, in his\r\n    village, passes for a grand match. Bravery and great warriors they\r\n    think much of--they constitute the latter their chiefs. Poverty is no\r\n    disgrace at the council board, and an orator in rags will speak out as\r\n    boldly, as successfully, as if he were decked out in gold cloth. They\r\n    come thus poorly habited in the presence of the Governor, indulge in\r\n    long harangues, and touch his hand fearlessly. When ladies are present\r\n    at these interviews, they honor them thus--seize their hand and shake\r\n    it in token of friendship. Before I became a nun I was present at some\r\n    of these ceremonies, and having won their good opinion, they would\r\n    extend to me a hand which was disgusting in the extreme, but which I\r\n    had cheerfully to accept for fear of offending them. They are\r\n    sometimes asked to dine at the Governor's table. Unlucky are their\r\n    neighbors, especially when they happen to be ladies, they are so\r\n    filthy in their persons.--1730.\"--_Revue Canadienne_, page 108-9.\r\n\r\nSuch the Montreal Indians in 1730.\r\n\r\nThe Lorette Chapel dates back, as well as the _Old Mill_, to 1731. In\r\n1862 the Chapel suffered much by fire. The tribe occupies land reserved by\r\nGovernment, under the regulations of the Indian Bureau of Ottawa. \"Indian\r\nLorette comprises from forty to fifty cottages, on the _plateau_ of\r\nthe falls--spread out, without design, over an area of about twenty square\r\nacres. In the centre runs the kings highway, the outer half sloping down,\r\ntowards the St. Charles. The most prominent objects are the church, a\r\ngrist mill and Mr. Reid's paper mill; close by a wooden fence encloses\r\n'God's acre,' in the centre of which a cross marks the tomb of Chief\r\nNicholas.\" [318] It is indeed, \"a wild spot, covered with the primitive\r\nforest and seamed by a deep and tortuous ravine, where the St. Charles\r\nfoams, white as a snow drift, over the black ledges, and where the\r\nsunshine struggles through matted boughs of the pine and the fir, to bask\r\nfor brief moments on the mossy rocks, or flash on the hurrying waters....\r\nHere, to this day, the tourist finds the remnants of a lost people,\r\nharmless weavers of baskets and sewers of mocassins, the Huron blood fast\r\nbleaching out of them.\"\r\n\r\nOf \"free and independent electors\" none here exist, the little Lorette\r\nworld goes on smoothly without them. \"No Huron on the Reserve can vote. No\r\nwhite man is allowed to settle within the sacred precincts of the Huron\r\nkingdom, composed, 1st, of the lofty _Plateau_ of the village of\r\nIndian Lorette, which the tribe occupy. 2nd. Of the forty square acres,\r\nabout a mile and a half to the north-west of the village. 3rd. Of the\r\nRocmont settlement, in the adjoining County of Portneuf, in the very heart\r\nof the Laurentine Mountains, ceded to the Hurons by Government, as a\r\ncompensation for the Seigniory of St. Gabriel, of which Government took\r\npossession, and to which the Hurons set up a claim.\r\n\r\n\"In all that which pertains to the occupation, the possession and the\r\nadministration of these fragments of its ancient extensive territory, the\r\nusages and customs of the tribe have force of law. The village is governed\r\nby a Council of Sachems; in cases of misunderstandings an appeal lies to\r\nthe Ottawa Bureau, under the control of the Minister of the Interior (our\r\n\"Downing street\" wisely abstaining from interference except on very urgent\r\noccasions). Lands descend by right of inheritance; the Huron Council alone\r\nbeing authorized to issue location tickets; none are granted but to Huron\r\nboys, strangers being excluded. Of course, these disabilities affect the\r\ndenizens of the reserve only; a Huron (and there are some,\r\n_Tahourenche_, Vincent and others) owning lands in his own right\r\nelsewhere, and paying taxes and tithes, enjoys the rights and immunities\r\nof any other British subject.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the Lorette Indian settlement in 1697, down to the year\r\nof the capitulation of Quebec--1759--the annals of the tribe afford but\r\nfew stirring incidents: an annual bear, beaver, or cariboo hunt; the\r\nreturn of a war party, with its scalps--English, probably--as the tribe\r\nhad a wholesome terror of the Iroquois; an occasional _pow wow_ as to\r\nhow many warriors could be spared to assist their trusted and brave\r\nallies, the French of Quebec, against the heretical soldiers of Old or New\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nWe are in possession of no facts to show that these Christianised Hurons\r\ndiffered much from other Christianised Indians; church services, war\r\ncouncils, feasting, smoking, dancing, scalping, fishing and hunting,\r\nfilling in, agreeably, socially, or usefully, the daily routine of their\r\nexistence. Civilization, as understood by christianised or by pagan\r\nsavages, has never inspired us with unqualified admiration. The various\r\nsiege narratives we have perused, whilst they bring in the Indian allies,\r\nat the close of the battle, to \"finish off\" the wounded at Montmorency, in\r\nJuly, 1759; at the plains of Abraham, in September 1759; at St. Foye, in\r\nApril, 1760, generally mention the Abenaquis for this delicate office of\r\n_friseurs_. The terror, nay, the horror, which the use of the tomahawk and\r\nscalping knife inspired to the British soldiery, was often greater than\r\ntheir fear of the French sabres and French musquetoons.\r\n\r\nBritish rule, in 1759, if it did bring the Hurons less of campaigning and\r\nfewer scalps, was the harbinger of domestic peace and stable homes, with\r\nvery remunerative contracts each fall for several thousands of pairs of\r\nsnow-shoes, cariboo mocassins and mittens for the English regiments\r\ntenanting the Citadel of Quebec, whose wealthy officers every winter\r\nscoured the Laurentine range, north of the city, in quest of deer, bear\r\nand cariboo, under the experienced guidance of Gros Louis, Sioui, Vincent,\r\nand other famous Huron Nimrods.\r\n\r\nThe chronicles of the settlement proclaim the valour and wisdom of some of\r\ntheir early chiefs, conspicuous appears the renowned Ahatsistari, surnamed\r\nthe Huron Saul, from his early hostility to missionaries; death closed his\r\ncareer, on the verdant banks of Lake Huron, in 1642, a convert to\r\nmissionary teachings.\r\n\r\nAt the departure of the French, in 1759, a new allegiance was forced on\r\nthe sons of the forest, St. George and his dragon for them took the place\r\nof St. Louis and his lilies. The _Deer_, the _Bear_, the _Tortoise_ and\r\nthe _Wolf_ tribe, however, have managed to live on most friendly terms\r\nwith the _Dragon_. In 1776, Lorette sent its contingent of painted and\r\nplumed warriors to fight General Burgoyne's inglorious campaigns. The\r\nservices rendered to England by her swarthy allies in the war of 1812-14\r\nwere marked, for years a distribution of presents took place from the\r\nQuebec Commissariat and Indian Department. Proudly did the Hurons, as well\r\nas the Abenaquis, Montagnais, Micmac and Malicite Indians bear the snow-\r\nwhite blankets, scarlet cloth and hunting-knives awarded them by George\r\nthe King, and by the victors of Waterloo. Each year, at midsummer, the\r\nIndians in their canoes, with their live freight of hunters, their copper-\r\ncoloured squaws and black-eyed papooses, rushed from Labrador, Gaspé,\r\nRestigouche, Baie des Chaleurs, and pitched their tents on a strip of land\r\nat Lévi, hence called Indian Cove, the city itself being closed to the\r\ngrim monarchs of the woods, reputed ugly customers when in their cups. A\r\nspecial envoy, however, was sent to the Lorette Indians on similar\r\noccasions. The Indians settled on Canadian soil were distinguished for\r\ntheir loyalty to England, who has ever treated them more mercifully than\r\ndid \"Uncle Sam.\"\r\n\r\nThe war between England and the United States in 1812 brought the Lorette\r\nbraves again to the front, and the future hero of Châteauguay, Col. De\r\nSalaberry, was sent to enlist them. Col. De Salaberry attended in person\r\non the tribe, at Indian Lorette. A grand pow-wow had been convoked. The\r\nsons of the forest eagerly sent in their names and got in readiness when\r\nthe Colonel returned a few days later to inform them that the Government\r\nhad decided to retain them as a reserve in the event of Quebec being\r\nattacked from the Kennebec.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this announcement, six Hurons (among whom were Joseph and\r\nStanislas Vincent) claimed with loud cries the right to accompany the\r\nCanadian _Voltigeurs_, commanded by the Colonel.\r\n\r\nAt Châteauguay, where 300 Canadians so gloriously repelled 7,000 invaders,\r\nthe brothers Vincent swam across the river to capture and make prisoners,\r\nthe flying Yankees.\r\n\r\nThese swarthy warriors had but a faint idea of what military discipline\r\nmeant, and thinking that, the battle being over, they could return to\r\nLorette, left accordingly. This was a flagrant case of desertion. Nothing\r\nshort of the brave Colonel's earnest entreaties, sufficed to procure a\r\npardon for the redskins.  A letter was written to Col. De Salaberry by his\r\nfather, late M.P. for the county, on this subject; it has been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe Hurons attended at Beauport at the unveiling of the monument of De\r\nSalaberry on the 27th of June, 1880, and subscribed bountifully to the\r\nbuilding fund.\r\n\r\nWhat with war medals, clothing, ammunition, fertile lands specially\r\nreserved at Lorette, on the Restigouche, at Nouvelle, Isle Verte,\r\nCaughnawaga, St. Regis, &c., the \"untutored savage,\" shielded by a\r\nbeneficent legislation, watched over by zealous missionaries, was at times\r\nan object of envy to his white brethren. Age or infirmity, seldom war,\r\ntore him away from this vale of sorrow, to join the great Indian\r\n\"majority\" in those happy hunting grounds promised to him by his Sachems.\r\n\r\nThe Hurons were ever ready to parade their paint, feathers, and tomahawks,\r\nat the arrival of every new Governor at Quebec, and to assure Ononthio,\r\n[319] of their undying attachment and unswerving loyalty to their great\r\nfather or august mother \"who dwells on the other side of the Great Lake.\"\r\nThese traditions have descended even to the time when _Ononthio_ was\r\nmerely a Lieutenant-Governor under Confederation. We recollect meeting, in\r\n31st March, 1873, a stately deputation, composed of twenty-three Hurons\r\nfrom Lorette, returning from Clermont, the country seat of Lieutenant-\r\nGovernor Caron, where they had danced the war-dance for the ladies, and\r\nharangued, as follows, the respected Laird of Clermont, just then\r\nappointed Lieutenant-Governor:--\r\n\r\nONONTHIO:--\r\n\r\nAisten tiothi non8a [320] tisohon dekha hiatanonstati deson8a8en-dio\r\ndaskemion tesontamai denon8a ation datito8anens tesanonron-h8a nionde,\r\naon8a deson8a8endio de8a desakatade; a8eti desanon-ronk8anion datito8anens\r\nchia ta skenrale the kiolaoutou8ison tothi chia hiaha a8eti dechienha\r\ntotinahiontati desten de sendete ataki atichiai a8eti alatonthara\r\ndeskemion ichionthe desten tiodeti aisten orachichiai.\r\n\r\n  Rev.

It was once a two story stone building, with ponderous walls.\r\nIn length it is fifty-five feet by thirty-five feet broad--pierced for six\r\nwindows in each story, with a well-proportioned door, in the centre. In\r\n1843, at the date of my first visit, the floor of the second story was yet\r\ntolerably strong: I ascended to it by a rickety, old staircase. The ruin\r\nwas sketched in 1858, by Col. Benj. Lossing, and reproduced in _Harper's\r\nMagazine_ for January, 1859. The lofty mountain to the north-west of it\r\nis called _La Montagne des Ormes_; for more than a century, the\r\nCharlesbourg peasantry designate the ruin as _La Maison de la Montagne_.\r\nThe English have christened it the _Hermitage_, whilst to the French\r\nportion of the population, it is known as Château-Bigot, or Beaumanoir;\r\nand truly, were it not on account of the associations which surround the\r\ntime-worn pile, few would take the trouble to go and look at the dreary\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nThe land on which it stands was formerly included in the _Fief de la\r\nTrinité_ granted between 1640 and 1650 to Monsieur Denis, a gentleman\r\nfrom La Rochelle, in France, the ancestor of the numerous clans of Denis,\r\nDenis de la Ronde, Denis de Vitré, &c. The seigniory was subsequently sold\r\nto Monseigneur de Laval, a descendant of the Montmorency's, who founded in\r\n1663 the Seminary of Quebec, and one of the most illustrious prelates in\r\nNew France, the portion towards the Mountain was dismembered. When the\r\nIntendant Talon formed his Baronie Des Islets [321] he annexed to it\r\ncertain lands of the _Fief de la Trinité_, amongst others that part\r\non which now stands the remains of the old château, of which he seems to\r\nhave been the builder, but which he subsequently sold. Bigot having\r\nacquired it long after, enlarged and improved it very much. He was a\r\nluxurious French gentleman, who, more than one hundred years ago, held the\r\nexalted post of Intendant or Administrator under the French Crown, in\r\nCanada. [322] In those days the forests which skirted the city were\r\nabundantly stocked with game: deer, of several varieties, bears, foxes,\r\nperhaps even that noble and lordly animal, now extinct in eastern Canada,\r\nthe Canadian stag, or Wapiti, roamed in herds over the Laurentian chain of\r\nmountains, and were shot within a few miles of the Château St. Louis. This\r\nmay have been one of the chief reasons why the French Lucullus erected the\r\nlittle _château_, which to this day bears his name--a resting place for\r\nhimself and friends after the chase. The profound seclusion of the spot,\r\ncombined with its beautiful scenery, would have rendered it attractive\r\nduring the summer months, even without the sweet repose it had in store\r\nfor a tired hunter. Tradition ascribes to it other purposes, and\r\namusements less permissible than those of the chase. A tragical occurrence\r\nenshrines the old building with a tinge of mystery which the pen of the\r\nnovelist has woven into a thrilling romance.\r\n\r\nFrançois Bigot, thirteenth and last Intendant of the Kings of France in\r\nCanada, was born in the Province of Guienne, and descended of a family\r\ndistinguished by professional eminence at the French bar. His commission\r\nbears date \"10th June, 1747.\" The Intendant had the charge of four\r\ndepartments: Justice, Police, Finance and Marine. He had previously filled\r\nthe post of Intendant in Louisiana, and also at Louisburg. The\r\ndisaffection and revolt caused by his rapacity in that city, were mainly\r\ninstrumental in producing its downfall and surrender to the English\r\ncommander, Pepperell, in 1745. Living at a time when tainted morals and\r\nofficial corruption ruled at court, he seems to have taken his standard of\r\nmorality from the mother country; his malversations in office, his\r\nextensive frauds on the treasury, more than £400,000; his colossal\r\nspeculations in provisions and commissariat supplies furnished by the\r\nFrench government to the colonists during a famine; his dissolute conduct\r\nand final downfall, are fruitful themes wherefrom the historian can draw\r\nwholesome lessons for all generations. Whether his Charlesbourg (then\r\ncalled Bourg Royal) castle was used as the receptacle of some of his most\r\nvaluable booty, or whether it was merely a kind of Lilliputian _Parc au\r\nCerfs_, such as his royal master had, tradition does not say. It would\r\nappear, however, that it was kept up by the plunder wrung from sorrowing\r\ncolonists, and that the large profits he made by paring from the scanty\r\npittance the French government allowed the starving residents, were here\r\nlavished in gambling, riot and luxury.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1757, the population of Quebec was reduced to subsist on four\r\nounces of bread per diem, one lb. of beef, HORSE-FLESH or CODFISH; and in\r\nApril of the following year, the miserable allowance was reduced to one\r\nhalf. \"At this time,\" remarks our historian, Garneau, \"famished men were\r\nseen sinking to the earth in the street from exhaustion.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the times during which Louis XV.'s minion would retire to his\r\nSardanapalian retreat, to gorge himself at leisure on the life blood of\r\nthe Canadian people, whose welfare he had sworn to watch over! Such, the\r\ndoings in the colony in the days of La Pompadour. The results of this\r\nmisrule were soon apparent: _the British lion placed his paw on the\r\ncoveted morsel_. The loss of Canada was viewed, if not by the nation,\r\nat least by the French Court, with indifference, to use the terms of one\r\nof Her Britannic Majesty's ministers, when its fate and possible loss were\r\ncanvassed one century later in the British Parliament, \"without\r\napprehension or regret.\" Voltaire gave his friends a banquet at Ferney, in\r\ncommemoration of the event; the court favourite congratulated His Majesty,\r\nthat since he had got rid of these \"fifteen hundred leagues of frozen\r\ncountry,\" he had now a chance of sleeping in peace; the minister Choiseul\r\nurged Louis XV. to sign the final treaty of 1763, saying that Canada would\r\nbe _un embarras_ to the English, and that if they were wise they\r\nwould have nothing to do with it. In the meantime the red cross of St.\r\nGeorge was waving over the battlements on which the lily-spangled banner\r\nof the Bourbons had proudly sat with but one interruption for one hundred\r\nand fifty years, the infamous Bigot was provisionally consigned to a\r\ndungeon in the Bastille--subsequently tried and exiled to Bordeaux; his\r\nproperty was confiscated, whilst his confederates and abettors, such as\r\nVarin, Bréard, Maurin, Corpron, Martel, Estèbe and others, were also tried\r\nand punished by fine, imprisonment and confiscation: one Penisseault, a\r\ngovernment clerk (a butcher's son by birth), who had married in the\r\ncolony, but whose pretty wife accompanied the Chevalier de Lévis on his\r\nreturn to France, seems to have fared better than the rest.\r\n\r\nBut to revert to the château walls as I saw them on the 4th of June, 1863.\r\n\r\nDuring a ramble with an English friend through the woods, which gave us an\r\nopportunity of providing ourselves with wild flowers to strew over the\r\ntomb of its fair \"Rosamond,\" [323] such as the marsh marigold, clintonia,\r\nuvularia, the star flower, veronica, kalmia, trillium, and Canadian\r\nviolets, we unexpectedly struck on the old ruin. One of the first things\r\nthat attracted our notice was the singularly corroding effect the easterly\r\nwind has on stone and mortar in Canada; the east gable being indented and\r\nmuch more eaten away than that exposed to the western blast. Of the\r\noriginal structure nothing is left now standing but the two gables and the\r\ndivision walls; they are all three of great thickness; certainly no modern\r\nhouse is built in the manner this seems to have been. It had two stories,\r\nwith rooms in the attic, and deep cellars; a communication existed from\r\none cellar to the other through the division wall. There is also visible a\r\nvery small door cut through the cellar wall of the west gable; it leads to\r\na vaulted apartment of some eight feet square; the small mound of masonry\r\nwhich covered it might originally have been effectually hidden from view\r\nby a plantation of trees over it. What could this have been built for,\r\nasked my romantic friend? Was it intended to secure some of the\r\nIntendant's plate or other portion of his ill-gotten treasure? Or else as\r\nthe Abbé Ferland suggests: [324] \"Was it to store the fruity old Port and\r\nsparkling Moselle of the club of the Barons, who held their jovial\r\nmeetings there about the beginning of this century?\" Was it his\r\nmistresses' secret _boudoir_ when the Intendant's lady visited the\r\nchâteau, like the Woodstock tower to which Royal Henry picked his way\r\nthrough \"Love's Ladder?\" _Quien sabe?_ Who can unravel the mystery?\r\nIt may have served for the foundation of the tower which existed when Mr.\r\nPapineau visited and described the place fifty years ago. The heavy cedar\r\nrafters, more than one hundred years old, are to this day sound: one has\r\nbeen broken by the fall, probably of some heavy stones. There are several\r\nindentures in the walls for fire-places, which are built of cut masonry;\r\nfrom the angle of one a song sparrow flew out uttering an anxious note. We\r\nsearched and discovered the bird's nest, with five spotted, dusky eggs in\r\nit. How strange! in the midst of ruin and decay, the sweet tokens of hope,\r\nlove and harmony! What cared the child of song if her innocent offspring\r\nwere reared amidst these mouldering relics of the past, mayhap a guilty\r\npast? Could she not teach them to warble sweetly, even from the roof which\r\nechoed the dying sighs of the Algonquin maid? Red alder trees grew rank\r\nand vigorous amongst the disjointed masonry, which had crumbled from the\r\nwalls into the cellar; no trace existed of the wooden staircase mentioned\r\nby Mr. Papineau; the timber of the roof had rotted away or been used for\r\ncamp fires by those who frequent and fish the elfish stream which winds\r\nits way over a pebbly ledge towards Beauport. It is well stocked with\r\nsmall trout, which seem to breed in great numbers in the dam near the\r\nChâteau--a stream, did we say?\r\n\r\n  \"A hidden brook,\r\n    In the leafy mouth of June,\r\n  That to the sleeping woods all night\r\n    Singeth a quiet tune\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough! enough! cried my poetic companion. The fate of the fair maid, the\r\nsong of birds, the rustling of groves, the murmur of yonder brook,--does\r\nnot all this remind you of the accents of our laurel-crowned poet, he who\r\nsang of Claribel?\"\r\n\r\nThose who wish to visit the Hermitage, are strongly advised to take the\r\ncart-road which leads easterly from the Charlesbourg church, turning up.\r\nPedestrians prefer the route through the fields; they may, in this case,\r\nleave their vehicle at Gaspard Huot's boarding-house--a little higher than\r\nthe church at Charlesbourg,--and then walk through the fields, skirting,\r\nduring the greater part of the road, the trout stream I have previously\r\nmentioned; but by all means _let them take a guide_ with them.\r\n\r\nLet us now translate and condense, from the interesting narrative of a\r\nvisit paid to the Hermitage in 1831, by Mr. Amédée Papineau and his\r\ntalented father, the Hon. Louis Joseph Papineau, the legend which attaches\r\nto it:\r\n\r\n\r\n    CAROLINE, OR THE ALGONQUIN MAID.\r\n\r\n    (BY AMÉDÉE PAPINEAU.)\r\n\r\n    \"We drove, my father and I, with our vehicle to the foot of the\r\n    mountain, and there, took a foot-path which led us through a dense\r\n    wood. We encountered and crossed a rivulet, and then ascended a\r\n    plateau cleared of wood, a most enchanting place; behind us and on our\r\n    right was a thick forest: on our left the eye rested on boundless\r\n    green fields, diversified [325] with golden harvests and with the neat\r\n    white cottages of the peasantry. In the distance was visible the broad\r\n    and placid waters of the St. Lawrence, at the foot of the citadel of\r\n    Quebec, and also the shining cupolas and tin roofs of the city houses;\r\n    in front of us, a confused mass of ruins, crenelated walls embedded in\r\n    moss and rank grass, together with a tower half destroyed, beams, and\r\n    the mouldering remains of a roof. After viewing the _tout ensemble_,\r\n    we attentively examined each portion in detail--every fragment was\r\n    interesting to us; we with difficulty made our way over the wall,\r\n    ascending the upper stories by a staircase which creaked and trembled\r\n    under our weight. With the assistance of a lighted candle we\r\n    penetrated into the damp and cavernous cellars, carefully exploring\r\n    every nook and corner, listening to the sound of our own footsteps,\r\n    and occasionally startled by the rustling of bats which we disturbed\r\n    in their dismal retreat. I was young, and consequently very\r\n    impressionable. I had just left college; these extraordinary sounds\r\n    and objects would at times make me feel very uneasy. I pressed close\r\n    to my father and dared scarcely breathe; the remembrance of this\r\n    subterranean exploration will not easily be forgotten. What were my\r\n    sensations when I saw a tombstone, the reader can imagine? 'Here we\r\n    are at last,' exclaimed my father and echo repeated his words.\r\n    Carefully did we view this monument; presently we detected the letter\r\n    'C,' nearly obliterated by the action of time; after remaining there a\r\n    few moments, to my unspeakable delight we made our exit from the\r\n    chamber of death, and stepping over the ruins, we again alighted on\r\n    the green sward. Evidently where we stood had formerly been a garden;\r\n    we could still make out the avenues, the walks and plots, over which\r\n    plum, lilac and apple trees grew wild.\r\n\r\n    \"I had not yet uttered a word, but my curiosity getting the better of\r\n    my fear, I demanded an explanation of this mysterious tombstone. My\r\n    father beckoned me towards a shady old maple; we both sat on the turf,\r\n    and he then told me as follows:--You have, no doubt, my son, heard of\r\n    a French Intendant, of the name of Bigot, who had charge of the public\r\n    funds in Canada somewhere about the year 1757; you have also read how\r\n    he squandered these moneys and how his Christian Majesty had him sent\r\n    to the Bastille when he returned to France, and had his property\r\n    confiscated. All this you know. I shall now tell you what, probably,\r\n    you do not know. This Intendant attempted to lead in Canada the same\r\n    dissolute life which the old _noblesse_ led in France before the\r\n    Revolution had _levelled_ all classes. He it was who built this\r\n    country seat, of which you now contemplate the ruins. Here he came to\r\n    seek relaxation from the cares of office; here he prepared\r\n    entertainments to which the rank and fashion of Quebec, including the\r\n    Governor General, eagerly flocked; nothing was wanting to complete the\r\n    _éclat_ of this _little_ Versailles. Hunting was a favorite pastime of\r\n    our ancestors, and Bigot was a mighty hunter. As active as a chamois,\r\n    as daring as a lion was this indefatigable Nimrod, in the pursuit of\r\n    bears and moose.\r\n\r\n    \"On one occasion, when tracking with some sporting friends an old bear\r\n    whom he had wounded, he was led over mountainous ridges and ravines\r\n    very far from the castle. Nothing could restrain him; on he went in\r\n    advance of every one, until the bloody trail brought him on the\r\n    wounded animal, which he soon dispatched.\r\n\r\n    \"During the chase the sun had gradually sunk over the western hills;\r\n    the shades of evening were fast descending; how was the lord of the\r\n    manor to find his way back? he was alone in a thick forest; in this\r\n    emergency his heart did not fail him,--he hoped by the light of the\r\n    moon to be able to return to his stray companions. Wearily he walked\r\n    on, ascending once or twice a lofty tree, in order to see further, but\r\n    all in vain; soon the unpleasant conviction dawned on him that like\r\n    others in similar cases, he had been walking round a circle. Worn out\r\n    and exhausted with fatigue and hunger, he sat down to ponder on what\r\n    course he should adopt. The Queen of night, at that moment shedding\r\n    her silvery rays around, only helped to show the hunter how hopeless\r\n    was his present position. Amidst these mournful reflections, his ear\r\n    was startled by the sound of footsteps close by; his spirits rose at\r\n    the prospect of help being at hand; soon he perceived the outlines of\r\n    a moving white object. Was it a phantom which his disordered\r\n    imagination had conjured up; terrified he seized his trusty gun and\r\n    was in the act of firing, when the apparition, rapidly advancing\r\n    toward him, assumed quite a human form; a little figure stood before\r\n    him with eyes as black as night, and raven tresses flowing to the\r\n    night wind; a spotless garment enveloped in its ample folds this airy\r\n    and graceful spectre. Was it a sylph, the spirit of the wilderness?\r\n    Was it Diana, the goddess of the chase, favoring one of her most\r\n    ardent votaries with a glimpse of her form divine? It was neither. It\r\n    was an Algonquin beauty, one of those ideal types whose white skin\r\n    betray their hybrid origin--a mixture of European blood with that of\r\n    the aboriginal races. It was Caroline, a child of love, born on the\r\n    shores of the great Ottawa river; a French officer was her sire, and\r\n    the powerful Algonquin tribe of the Beaver claimed her mother.\r\n\r\n    \"The Canadian Nimrod, struck at the sight of such extraordinary\r\n    beauty, asked her name, and after relating his adventure, he begged of\r\n    her to shew him the way to the castle in the neighborhood, as she must\r\n    be familiar with every path in the forest. Such is the story told of\r\n    the first meeting between the Indian beauty and the Canadian Minister\r\n    of Finance and Feudal Judge in the year 175--.\r\n\r\n    \"The Intendant was a married man; [326] his lady resided in the\r\n    capital of Canada. She seldom accompanied her husband on his hunting\r\n    excursions, but soon it was whispered that something more than the\r\n    pursuit of wild animals attracted him to his country seat; an intrigue\r\n    with an Indian beauty was hinted at. These discreditable rumors came\r\n    to the ears of her ladyship; she made several visits to the castle in\r\n    hopes of verifying her worst fears; jealousy is a watchful sentinel.\r\n\r\n    \"The Intendant's dormitory was on the ground floor of the building; it\r\n    is supposed the Indian girl occupied a secret apartment on the flat\r\n    above; that her boudoir was reached through a long narrow passage,\r\n    ending with a hidden staircase opening on the large room which\r\n    overlooked the garden.\r\n\r\n      \"The King, therefore, for his defence\r\n        Against the furious Queen,\r\n      At Woodstock builded such a bower,\r\n        As never yet was seen.\r\n      Most curiously that bower was built,\r\n        Of stone and timber strong.\"\r\n                            (Ballad of Fair Rosamond.)\r\n\r\n    \"Let us now see what took place on this identical spot on the 2nd\r\n    July, 176--. It is night; the hall clock has just struck eleven; the\r\n    murmur of the neighboring brook, gently wafted on the night wind, is\r\n    scarcely audible; the Song Sparrow [327] has nearly finished his\r\n    evening hymn, while the _Sweet Canada_ [328] bird, from the top\r\n    of an old pine, merrily peals forth his shrill clarion. Silence the\r\n    most profound pervades the whole castle; every light is extinguished;\r\n    the pale rays of the moon slumber softly on the oak floor, reflected\r\n    as they are through the gothic windows; every inmate is wrapped in\r\n    sleep, even fair Rosamond who has just retired. Suddenly her door is\r\n    violently thrust open; a masked person, with one bound rushes to her\r\n    bed-side, and without saying a word, plunges a dagger to the hilt in\r\n    her breast. Uttering a piercing shriek, the victim springs in the air\r\n    and falls heavily on the floor. The Intendant, hearing the noise,\r\n    hurries up stairs, raises the unhappy girl who has just time to point\r\n    to the fatal weapon, still in the wound, and then falls back in his\r\n    arms a lifeless corpse. The whole household are soon on foot; search\r\n    is made for the murderer, but no clue is discovered. Some of the\r\n    inmates fancied they had seen the figure of a woman rush down the\r\n    secret stair and disappear in the woods about the time the murder took\r\n    place. A variety of stories were circulated, some pretended to trace\r\n    the crime to the Intendant's wife, whilst others alleged that the\r\n    avenging mother of the creole was the assassin; some again urged that\r\n    Caroline's father had attempted to wipe off the stain on the honour of\r\n    his tribe, by himself despatching his erring child. A profound mystery\r\n    to this day surrounds the whole transaction. Caroline was buried in\r\n    the cellar of the castle, and the letter 'C' engraved on her\r\n    tombstone, which, my son, you have just seen.\"\r\n\r\nHalf a century has now elapsed since the period mentioned in this\r\nnarrative. In vain do we search for several of the leading characteristics\r\non which Mr. Papineau descants so eloquently; time, the great destroyer,\r\nhas obliterated many traces. Nothing meets one's view but mouldering\r\nwalls, over which green moss and rank weeds cluster profusely.\r\nUnmistakable indications of a former garden there certainly are, such as\r\nthe outlines of walks over which French cherry, apple and gooseberry trees\r\ngrow in wild luxuriance. I took home from the ruins a piece of bone; this\r\ndecayed piece of mortality may have formed part of Caroline's big toe, for\r\naught I can establish to the contrary; Château-Bigot brought back to my\r\nmind other remembrances of the past. I recollected reading that pending\r\nthe panic consequent on the surrender of Quebec in 1759, the non-\r\ncombatants of the city crowded within its walls; this time not to\r\nrealized, but to seek concealment until Mars had inscribed another victory\r\non the British flag. Who would be prepared to swear that later, when\r\nArnold and Montgomery had possession of the environs of Quebec, during the\r\ngreater portion of the winter, of 1775-6, some of those prudent English\r\nmerchants, (Adam Lymburner at their head), who awaited at Charlesbourg and\r\nBeauport the issue of the contest, did not take a quiet drive, to Château-\r\nBigot, were it only to indulge in a philosophical disquisition on the\r\nmutability of human events?\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mr. John D. Stewart of Quebec for a copy of the\r\nfollowing letter from his grandfather, written in 1776, from the Château.\r\n\r\n(Mr. Charles Stewart, father of the late Mr. Charles Grey Stewart,\r\nComptroller of Customs, to his father.)\r\n\r\n    \"HERMITAGE, June 25th, 1776.\r\n\r\n    \"MY DEAR FATHER,--I was overjoyed to hear by a letter from Mr. Gray,\r\n    that you and my dear mother were in good health. Nothing can give me\r\n    greater pleasure than to hear so. I was very sorry to hear that my\r\n    sister had been ill. I hope she is now getting better.\r\n\r\n    We have been here for this winter in a very dismal situation. The\r\n    rebels came here and blocked up the town of Quebec, at the end of\r\n    November. I had been not at all well for two months previous, and at\r\n    that time had not got better with a pain which obliged me to stay in\r\n    the country, where I had been all the summer, although greatly against\r\n    my inclination. I was allowed to remain peaceably by the rebels, until\r\n    the middle of January, when I was taken and carried with sword and\r\n    (fixed) bayonets before their general; the reason why, was, that after\r\n    their attack upon the town on the 31st December, the Yankees were\r\n    obliged to demand assistance of the country people to join them. I had\r\n    spoken and done what I could to hinder the people of the village where\r\n    I resided from going and taking arms with them. This came to light,\r\n    and I was told at their head-quarters their general, one Arnold, a\r\n    horse jockey or shipmaster, who then had the command, threatened to\r\n    send me over to the (New England) colonies. After being detained a ...\r\n    and two days, Arnold asked me, if he had not seen me before in Quebec.\r\n    I said he had, and put him in remembrance of having once dined with\r\n    him; upon which he said, on condition that I gave my word of honour\r\n    not to meddle in the matter, he would allow me to go away. I told him\r\n    the inhabitants were a parcel of scoundrels, and beyond a gentleman's\r\n    notice; upon this I got off, and remained for upwards of two months\r\n    without molestation, till the tracks of persons going to town from\r\n    Beauport had been observed; the country people immediately suspected\r\n    me, and came with drawn cutlasses to take me; luckily I was from home,\r\n    having gone two days before about fifteen miles to see an\r\n    acquaintance, and when I got back they had found out who had gone in\r\n    (to town). The ill-nature of the peasants to me made me very uneasy on\r\n    account of all the papers I had of Mr. Gray's, and dreading their\r\n    malice much, I determined to go from them. I found out a place about\r\n    five miles up amongst the woods, the Hermitage which being vacant I\r\n    immediately retired to it, and carried all my papers with me. Mr.\r\n    Peter Stewart had gone from his house in Beauport, down with his\r\n    family to the Posts, and gave me the charge of it, and having heard\r\n    that they (the Yankees) were going to put 150 men in it, I sent all\r\n    his furniture, &c., to the house I had taken, so that I had my house\r\n    all furnished; this was in the beginning of March; since which I have\r\n    remained there. The people who left the town in the fall have not been\r\n    allowed to go back. A Mr. Vi... one of the most considerable\r\n    merchants, went in immediately after the 6th of May, (the day when the\r\n    town people made a sally with about 900 men in all, who drove nigh\r\n    3000 of the Yankees from their camp, and relieved the town) and was\r\n    sent to prison and kept several days. Major John Nairn was so obliging\r\n    as to come out 8 or 9 days after that affair to see me; he asked me\r\n    why I had not been in town. I told him the reason; I had got no pass.\r\n    The next day he sent me one; except another, this is the only one\r\n    which had been granted by the Governor as yet, and it is thought some\r\n    won't be allowed to go in this summer, why, I cannot say. Every person\r\n    had liberty to leave or stay by a proclamation for that purpose, but\r\n    as it is military law, no person dare say it is wrong\r\n\r\n    I am going now again to remain in town, having now learned a little of\r\n    the French. I understand every word almost that is said, although I\r\n    cannot speak it as well; however I could wish that my brother John\r\n    knew as much of it. I three days ago wrote him they were gone to\r\n    Halifax, but am told they are to go from there to New York soon....\r\n\r\n    I am at present studying a little of the French law. If I do not make\r\n    use it, it will do me no harm. I expect you have had letters from my\r\n    brother Andrew....\r\n\r\n    I wish you would send me your vouchers of all your Jamaica debts I\r\n    could go easily from here to there. If I cannot get money I can get\r\n    rum, which sells and will sell, at a great price in this place. I can\r\n    only stay there a few months.\"\r\n\r\nNor must we forget the jolly pic-nics the barons held there some eighty\r\nyears ago. [329]\r\n\r\nOn quitting these silent halls, from which the light of other days had\r\ndeparted, and from whence the voice of revelry seems to have fled forever,\r\nI re-crossed the little brook, already mentioned, musing on the past. The\r\nsolitude which surrounds the dwelling and the tomb of the dark-haired\r\nchild of the wilderness, involuntarily brought to mind that beautiful\r\npassage of Ossian, [330] relating to the daughter of Reuthamir, the\r\n\"white-bosomed\" Moina:--\"I have seen the walls of Balclutha, but they\r\nwere desolate. The fire had resounded in the halls, and the voice of the\r\npeople is heard no more. The thistle shook there its lonely head; the moss\r\nwhistled to the wind. The fox looked out of the windows, the rank grass of\r\nthe wall waved round its head. Desolate is the dwelling of Moina, silence\r\nis in the house.... Raise the, song of mourning, O bards! over the land of\r\nstrangers. They have but fallen before us: for one day, we must fall.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nL'INTENDANT BIGOT--ROMANCE CANADIENNE.\r\nPAR JOS. MARMETTE.\r\n\r\nAfter perusing the Legend of _Caroline, the Algonquin Maid_, the lover of\r\nCanadian story, can find a more artistically woven plot in one of Mr.\r\nMarmette's historical novels L'Intendant Bigot. The following passage\r\nis from a short critique we recently published thereon:\r\n\r\n    \"It is within the portals of Beaumanoir (Château-Bigot) that several\r\n    of the most thrilling scenes in Mr. Marmette's novel are supposed to\r\n    have taken place. A worthy veteran of noble birth, M. de Rochebrune,\r\n    had died in Quebec through neglect and hunger, on the very steps of\r\n    Bigot's luxurious palace, then facing the St Charles, leaving an only\r\n    daughter, as virtuous as she was beautiful. One day, whilst returning\r\n    through the fields (where St. Rochs has since been built) from\r\n    visiting a nun in the General Hospital, she was unexpectedly seized by\r\n    a strong arm and thrown on a swift horse, whose rider never stopped\r\n    until he had deposited his victim at Bigot's country seat,\r\n    Charlesbourg. The name of this cold-blooded villain was Soumois. He\r\n    was a minion of the mighty and unscrupulous Bigot. Mdlle. de\r\n    Rochebrune had a lover. A dashing young French officer was Raoul de\r\n    Beaulac. Maddened with love and rage he closely watched Bigot's\r\n    movements in the city, and determined to repossess his treasure, it\r\n    mattered not, at what sacrifice. Bigot's was a difficult game to play.\r\n    He had a _liaison_ with one of the most fascinating and fashionable\r\n    married ladies of Quebec, and was thus prevented from hastening to see\r\n    the fair prey awaiting him at Beaumanoir. Raoul played a bold game,\r\n    and calling jealousy to his help, he went and confided the deed to\r\n    Madame Pean, Bigot's fair charmer, entreating her immediate\r\n    interference, and after some hairbreadth escapes, arrived at the\r\n    Château with her just in time to save Mdlle de Rochebrune from\r\n    dishonor.\r\n\r\n    Madame Pean was returning to the city with Mdlle de Rochebrune and\r\n    Raoul, when on driving past the walls of the Intendant's palace, close\r\n    to the spot where Desfosses street now begins, her carriage was\r\n    attacked by a band of armed men--a reconnoitering party from Wolfe's\r\n    fleet, anchored at Montmorency. A scuffle ensued, shots were fired,\r\n    and some of the assailants killed; but in the _mêlée_ Mdlle. de\r\n    Rochebrune was seized and hurried into the English boat commanded by\r\n    one Capt. Brown. During the remainder of the summer the Canadian maid,\r\n    treated with every species of respect, remained a prisoner on board\r\n    the admiral's ship. (It is singular that Admiral Durell, whose beloved\r\n    young son was at the time a prisoner of war at Three Rivers, did not\r\n    propose an exchange of prisoners.) In the darkness and confusion which\r\n    attended the disembarking of Wolfe's army on the night of the 12th of\r\n    September, 1759, at Sillery, Mdlle. de Rochebrune slipped down the\r\n    side of the vessel, and getting into one of the smaller boats, drifted\r\n    ashore with the tide, and landed at Cap Rouge, just as her lover\r\n    Raoul, who was a Lieutenant in La Roche-Beaucour's Cavalry was\r\n    patrolling the heights of Sillery. Overpowered with joy, she rode\r\n    behind him back to the city, and left him on nearing her home; but, to\r\n    her horror, she spied dodging her footsteps her arch enemy the\r\n    Intendant, and fell down in a species of fit, which turned out to be\r\n    catalepsy. This furnishes, of course, a very moving _tableau_. The\r\n    fair girl---supposed to be dead---was laid out in her shroud, when\r\n    Raoul, during the confusion of that terrible day for French Rule, the\r\n    13th September, calling to see her, finds her a corpse just ready for\r\n    interment. Fortunately for the heroine, a bombshell forgotten in the\r\n    yard, all at once and in the nick of time igniting, explodes,\r\n    shattering the tenement in fragments. The concussion recalls Mdlle. de\r\n    Rochebrune to life; a happy marriage soon after ensues. The chief\r\n    character in the novel, the Intendant sails shortly after for France,\r\n    where he was imprisoned, as history states, in the Bastile, during\r\n    fifteen months, and his ill-gotten gains confiscated. All this, with\r\n    the exception of Mdlle. de Rochebrune's career, is strictly\r\n    historical.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE FALLS OF THE CHAUDIÈRE_.\r\n\r\nA tourist of a cultured mind and familiar with classic lore, standing on\r\nthe lofty brow of the _Chaudière_, might, without any peculiar flights of\r\nimagination, fancy he beholds around him a solitary dell of that lovely\r\nTEMPE immortalized in song:\r\n\r\n  \"Est nemos Haemoniae, praerupta quod undique claudit\r\n  Silva; vocant Tempe; per quae Peneus ab imo\r\n  Effusus Pindo, spumosis volvitur undis,\r\n  Dejectuque gravi tenues agitantia fumos\r\n  Nubila conducit, sommasque aspergine silvas\r\n  Impluit, et sonitu plus quam vicina fatigat.\"\r\n                        _Ovid Met_. I--568.\r\n\r\nThe Falls of the _Chaudière_, in their chief features, differ entirely\r\nfrom the majestic cascade of Montmorency.\r\n\r\n\"To a person who desires nothing more than the primary and sudden electric\r\nfeeling of an overpowering and rapturous surprise, the cascade of\r\nMontmorency would certainly be preferable, but to the visitor, whose\r\nunderstanding and sensibilities are animated by an infusion of antiquated\r\nromance, the Falls of the _Chaudière_ would be more attractive.\" [331]\r\n\r\nThis favourite resort of tourists is accessible by two modes of travel. We\r\nwould assuredly advise visitors, both on account of the striking objects\r\nto be met with, to select the water route, going the land route on their\r\nreturn; a small steamer plies daily, for a 10 cent fare, at stated hours,\r\nfrom the Lower Town market place, touching at Sillery and skirting the\r\ndark frowning cliffs of Cape Diamond, amidst the shipping, affording a\r\nunique view of the mural-crowned city. After stopping five minutes at the\r\nSillery wharf, the steamer crosses over and lands its passengers nearly\r\nopposite the R. C. Church of St. Romuald, which, with its frescoed ceiling\r\nand ornate interior is one of the handsomest temples of worship round\r\nQuebec. Vehicles are abundant at Levi and at St. Romuald; an hour's drive\r\nwill land the tourist on the weird and romantic brink of the\r\n_Chaudière_, either by following the lower road on the beach, skirting the\r\nadjoining highland, or taking the road on the heights.\r\n\r\n\"Although yielding in grandeur to Niagara and Montmorency, it possesses\r\nfeatures more interesting than either. The river, in its course of one\r\nhundred miles over a rugged bed, full of rapids and falls, is here\r\nnarrowed to a width of between three hundred and four hundred feet, and is\r\nprecipitated over a height of about one hundred and thirty feet,\r\npreserving the characteristic features of its _boiling_ waters, till\r\nit mingles with the St. Lawrence. Hence it has received the appropriate\r\nname of _Chaudière_ or _Caldron_. Instead of descending in one continuous\r\nsheet, it is divided by large projecting rocks into three channels or\r\ncataracts, which, however, unite before reaching the basin below. A\r\nglobular figure is imparted to the descending volumes of brilliant white\r\nfoam, in consequence of the deep excavations of the rocks, and the clouds\r\nof spray produce in the sunshine a brilliant variety of prismatic colours.\r\nThe dark-green foliage of the dense forests that overhang the torrent on\r\nboth sides, forms a striking contrast with its snow-white foam.\r\n\r\n\"The wild diversity of rocks, the foliage of the overhanging woods, the\r\nrapid motion, the effulgent brightness and the--deeply solemn sound of the\r\ncataracts, all combine to present a rich assemblage of objects highly\r\nattractive, especially when the visitor, emerging from the wood, is\r\ninstantaneously surprised by the delightful scene. Below, the view is\r\ngreatly changed, and the falls produce an additionally strong and vivid\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n\"If strangers view the Falls from one side of the river only, the prospect\r\nfrom the eastern shore is recommended as preferable.\r\n\r\n\"The Falls of Montmorency are not immediately surrounded by any rugged\r\nscenery, calculated to strengthen and perpetuate the peculiar emotion\r\nwhich is excited by the first glimpse of the cascade, but the dreary\r\nwildness in the foliage of the encircling forest, the total absence of\r\nevery vestige of human improvement, and the tumultuous waves and commotion\r\nand effulgence that incessantly occupy the mind and rivet the senses of\r\nthe beholder in the survey of the _Chaudière_, conjoined with the wider\r\nexpansion and larger quantity of water in the stream, in the opinion\r\nof many visitors more than compensate for the greater elevation from which\r\nthe waters of the Montmorency are precipitated.\"\r\n\r\nOn returning to the town of Levi, the tourist, taking the upper road, may\r\nvisit the Falls of Etchemin, where have existed for close on a century,\r\nthe extensive saw mills of Sir John Caldwell. They are now owned by Henry\r\nAtkinson, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n[See p. 4.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_JACQUES CARTIER'S OFFICERS AND CREW._\r\n\r\n_Liste de l'Équipage_ de Jacques Cartier, conservée dans les archives\r\nde St. Malo, France--revue avec soin sur le _fac-similé_ par C.

He was\r\ncommitted to the care of his tutor, Thomas Leverous, who conveyed him in a\r\nlarge basket into Offaly to his sister, Lady Mary O'Connor. There he\r\nremained until he perfectly recovered. The misfortunes of his family had\r\nexcited great sympathy for the boy over the whole of Ireland. This made\r\nthe government anxious to have him in their power; and they endeavored\r\naccordingly to induce O'Brien to surrender him to them. About the 5th of\r\nMarch, 1540, Lady Eleanor O'Donnel, suspecting that it was the intention\r\nof her husband to surrender Gerald to the English Government, resolved to\r\nsend him away. She engaged a merchant vessel of St. Malo which happened to\r\nbe in Donegal Bay, to convey a small party to the coast of Brittany.\r\n\r\n\"Bartholomew Warner, an agent of the English Government, sends the\r\nfollowing account of this transaction to Sir John Wallop, the English\r\nAmbassador in France:\r\n\r\n\"'After ther departing from Yrlande they arryved at Murles (Morlaix) wher,\r\nas he was well receyvyd of the Captayne, whiche leadde him throughe the\r\ntowne by the hande, wher he tarryed 3 or 4 days, and strayghtwayes, the\r\ncaptayne sent word to Monsieur de Chattebriande off ther arrivying ther.\r\n* * * * And from thens they came in the sayde shippe to Saynt Malo, where\r\nhe was also well receyvyd of them of the Town, and specially of Jacques\r\nQuartier, the pilot, which your Lordship spake off at my being at\r\nRouene.'\"--_The Earls of Kildare and their Ancestors, from_ 1057 _to_\r\n1773, by the Marquis of Kildare. 3rd edition, pp. 179, 196.\r\n\r\n\r\n_DISCOVERY OF THE REMAINS OF JACQUES CARTIER'S VESSEL, THE \"PETITE\r\nHERMINE.\"_\r\n\r\n(_Note for pages 429-431-455._)\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of August, 1843, there was much commotion among the\r\nantiquarians of our old city. Mr. Jos. Hamel, the city surveyor, had\r\nthought it proper to call the attention of the Literary and Historical\r\nSociety to the remains of a vessel lying at the brook St. Michel, which\r\nfalls into the River St. Charles on the north bank about half way between\r\nthe General Hospital and old Dorchester Bridge. This vessel was supposed\r\nto be the _Petite Hermine_, one of Jacques Cartier's vessels left by\r\nhim at the place where he wintered in 1535-6.\r\n\r\n\"The existence of this vessel had been known to persons frequenting the\r\nplace for a great many years. Part of it, the farthest out in the stream,\r\nhad been carried away for firewood or otherwise, and the forepart of the\r\nvessel was covered with clay and earth from the adjoining bank to the\r\ndepth of six or seven feet. This was in great part removed, leaving the\r\nkeel and part of the planking and ribs visible. The vessel had been built\r\nof large-grained oak, which was mostly in a good state of preservation,\r\nalthough discolored, and the iron spikes and bolts were still strong. The\r\nbolts in the keel, contrary to the usual practice, had been placed in from\r\nbelow. This is the spot where Jacques Cartier, is supposed to have\r\nwintered. The tide rises in the entrance of the brook, where the vessel\r\nlies, about six or seven feet. This entrance forms a semi-circular cove,\r\non each side of which towards the St. Charles, the earth is elevated so as\r\nto have the appearance of a breastwork; the bank to the west of the cove\r\nis about eighteen feet high, and it was then covered with thick brush\r\nwhich prevented its being fully examined. The distance of the place from\r\ntown is about one mile; the road is over the Dorchester Bridge and along\r\nthe north bank of the St. Charles.\"--(_Quebec Gazette_, August 30, 1843).\r\n\r\n(_From the Quebec Gazette, 30th August_, 1843.)\r\n\r\n\"In the last number (August 25th, inst.,) of _Le Canadien_ there is\r\nan article of deep interest to the Canadian antiquarian: The long agitated\r\nquestion as to the _where_ or _whereabouts_ Jacques Cartier, on his second\r\nvoyage from France to this continent spent the winter of 1535-6; whether\r\nat the embouchure of the river bearing his name emptying into the St.\r\nLawrence some ten or eleven leagues above Quebec, or in the little river\r\nSt. Charles to the north of and at the foot of the promontory on which\r\nQuebec is built, is now, it would seem, about to be solved and\r\nsatisfactorily set at rest by the recent discovery of the remains of a\r\nvessel, doubtless of European construction, supposed to be those of _La\r\nPetite Hermine_, of about 60 tons burthen, one of the three (_La Grande\r\nHermine_, _La Petite Hermine_, and _L'Emerillon_), with which on the 19th\r\nof May, 1535, that intrepid navigator left St. Malo.\r\n\r\nThe article alluded to, which we believe to be the work of the editor\r\nhimself (Mr. McDonald) of _Le Canadien_, logically establishes from\r\nJacques Cartier's narrative that the place of his wintering, or Sainte\r\nCroix, as he named it, can be none other than the little river St.\r\nCharles, as we now call it. \"Coasting,\" says he, \"the said island\r\n(Orleans) we found at the upper end of it an expanse of water very\r\nbeautiful and pleasant, at which place there is a little river and bar\r\nharbor with two or three fathoms of water, which we found to be a place\r\nsuitable for putting our vessels in safety. We called it _Ste. Croix_,\r\nbecause on that day, (14th September) we arrived there. Near this place\r\nthere are natives, whose chief is Donnacona and who lives there, which\r\nplace is called Stadaconé,\" (now Quebec). Cartier observes in another part\r\nof his narrative that _Sainte Croix_ was situate half a league from _and\r\nto the north_ of Quebec. Again, speaking of the residence (Stadacone) of\r\nDonnacona, he says, \"_under which high land towards the north_ is the\r\nriver and harbour Sainte Croix, at which place we remained from the 15th\r\nof September, to the 16th of May, 1536, where the vessels remained dry.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"We now translate from _Le Canadien_:--'At the invitation of Mr. Jos.\r\nHamel, City Surveyor, Hon. Wm. Sheppard, the President, and (G. B.)\r\nFaribault, Vice-President of the Literary and Historical Society of\r\nQuebec, went with him on Saturday, the 19th instant, (1843) to visit the\r\nplace, and according to the position of the _debris_ of the vessel,\r\nthe nature of the wood it is composed of, and the character of the stones\r\n(ballast) they found at the bottom, they were satisfied that all the\r\nprobabilities are in favor of Mr. Hamel's hypothesis.\r\n\r\n\"'On a report of this visit, the Council of the Literary and Historical\r\nSociety assembled on Monday last, and resolved on laying open the\r\n_debris_, leaving it to Mr. Faribault, the Vice-President, to make,\r\nwith Mr. Hamel, the necessary arrangements for the execution. The members\r\nof the Council having no funds at their disposal, that they can legally\r\napply to this purpose, have so far carried it on at their own expense.\r\n\r\n\"'Some valuable evidences of the ancient existence of this vessel have\r\nbeen gathered. We shall speak of them in giving an account of the\r\nexhumation in progress, under the direction of Messrs. Faribault and\r\nHamel. All those who can throw any light on the subject, either of their\r\nown knowledge or by what they may have learnt by tradition, are earnestly\r\nsolicited to impart the same at the Office of _Le Canadien_.'\r\n\r\n\"Those gentlemen ought not to be allowed to carry on this work at their\r\nsole expense. The country, the world, are interested in it. This continent\r\nin 1535, from end to end one vast wilderness, the imagination can scarcely\r\nfigure to itself a more awful solitude than that in which, during the\r\nwinter of 1535-6 Cartier and his faithful followers, amidst savages in an\r\nunknown country, during a Canadian winter, at a thousand leagues from\r\ntheir native land, were buried in the dreary swamp (for it then must have\r\nbeen little better) of _Sainte Croix_ now the beautiful valley of the\r\nSt. Charles, covered with cheerful cottages and a redundant population.\r\nLook to-day from the Citadel of _Stadaconé_ in all directions north,\r\nsouth, east, west, than which under heaven, there is not a more splendid\r\npanorama, and think of what it was when Cartier and his comrades first\r\nlooked upon it. Contrast his landing on the flinty rock at the base of\r\nCape Diamond, the 14th September, 1535, and reception by a few gaping\r\nsavages, with that of the present Governor-General, Sir Charles Metcalfe;\r\namidst acclaiming thousands, on the 25th (Aug. 1843)--the manner of\r\npassing a winter at Stadaconé in 1535-6 and at the same place in 1842-3.\r\nWhat changes have the three centuries wrought! What recollections have\r\nthey left! And what changes will not the next three hundred years bring\r\nabout? More wonderful probably than those we admire to-day. But come what\r\nmay of that which men sometimes call great and glorious, nothing can\r\nobliterate or eclipse the honors justly due to the memory of the\r\ncelebrated navigator and his comrades, who first \"coasting the said island\r\n(now Orleans) found at the end of it an expanse of water very beautiful\r\nand pleasant, and a little bar harbour,\" ('hable,' as he calls it,) and\r\nwintered there at about half a league northward of and under the highland\r\nof Stadaconé.\"\r\n\r\n\"During the dismal winter Jacques Cartier must have passed in his new\r\nquarters at _Ste. Croix_, he lost, by sickness contracted, it is said,\r\nfrom the natives, but more probably from scurvy, twenty-five of his\r\nmen. This obliged him to abandon one of his three vessels (_La Petite\r\nHermine_ it is believed) which he left in her winter quarters, returning\r\nwith the two others to France. The _locale_ of the _débris_ or remains,\r\nnot only corresponds with the description given by Jacques Cartier of Ste.\r\nCroix, but also with the attention and particular care that might be\r\nexpected from a skilful commander, in the selection of a safe spot in an\r\nunknown region where never an European had been before him, for wintering\r\nhis vessels. They lie in the bottom of a small creek or gulley, known as\r\nthe _ruisseau St. Michel_, into which the tides regularly flow, on the\r\nproperty of Charles Smith, Esq., on the north side of the St. Charles and\r\nat about half a mile following the bends of the river above the site of\r\nthe old Dorchester Bridge.--They are a little up the creek at about an\r\nacre from its mouth, and their position (where a sudden or short turn of\r\nthe creek renders it next to impossible that she should be forced out of\r\nit by any rush of water in the spring or efforts of the ice,) evinces at\r\nonce the precaution and the judgment of the commander in his choice of the\r\nspot. But small portions of her remaining timber (oak) are visible through\r\nthe mud, but they are bitumanised and black as ebony, and after reposing\r\nin that spot 307 years, seem, as far as by chopping them with axes or\r\nspades, and probing by iron rods or picks, can be ascertained, sound as\r\nthe day they were brought thither. The merit of the discovery belongs to\r\nour fellow townsman, Mr. Joseph Hamel, the City Surveyor.\"\r\n\r\nQuebec, 28th August, 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"LE CANON DE BRONZE.\"--THE BRONZE CANNON._\r\n\r\n\"A few years ago an ancient cannon of peculiar make, and supposed to have\r\nbeen of Spanish construction, was found in the river St. Lawrence,\r\nopposite the Parish of Champlain, in the District of Three Rivers. It is\r\nnow in the Museum of Mr. Chasseur, and will repay the visit of the curious\r\nstranger. The ingenious writer of the Treatise upon this piece of\r\nordnance, published in the second volume of the TRANSACTIONS of the\r\nLiterary and Historical Society of Quebec, has endeavoured to show that it\r\nbelonged to Verazzani,--that the latter perished before the second voyage\r\nof Jacques Cartier, either by scurvy or shipwreck, on his way up the river\r\ntowards Hochelaga. He also endeavors, with great stretch of fancy, to\r\nexplain and account for the pantomime enacted by the Indians in the\r\npresence of Jacques Cartier, in order to dissuade him from proceeding to\r\nHochelaga so late in the season, by their recollection and allusion to the\r\ndeath of Verazzani, some nine or ten years before. But if they had really\r\nknown anything respecting the fate of this navigator--and it must have\r\nbeen fresh in their memory, if we recall to mind how comparatively short a\r\nperiod had elapsed--is it not most likely that they would have found\r\nmeans, through the two interpreters to communicate it to Cartier? Yet it\r\nappears that the latter never so much as heard of it, either at Hochelai,\r\nnow the Richelieu, where he was on friendly terms with the chief of the\r\nvillage--or at Hochelaga, where it must have been known--or when he\r\nwintered at Ste. Croix, in the little river St. Charles--nor yet when he\r\npassed a second winter at Carouge! The best evidence, however, that the\r\nIndian pantomime had no reference to Verazzani, and to disprove at once\r\nthe truth of the tradition respecting his death in any part of the St.\r\nLawrence, is to show, which we shall do on good authority, that at the\r\nvery time when Cartier was passing the winter at Ste. Croix, Verazzani was\r\nactually alive in Italy. From a letter of Annibal Caro, quoted by\r\nTiraboschi, an author of undoubted reputation, in the Storie della\r\nLiterature Italiana, Vol. VII. part I. pp. 261, 462, it is proved that\r\nVerazzani was living in 1537, a year after the pantomime at Ste. Croix!\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of the Canon de Bronze it may be noted that\r\nCharlevoix mentions also a tradition, that Jacques Cartier himself was\r\nshipwrecked at the mouth of the river called by his name, with the loss of\r\none of his vessels. From this it has been supposed that the Canon de\r\nBronze was lost on that occasion; and an erroneous inscription to that\r\neffect has been engraved upon it. In the first place the cannon was not\r\nfound at the mouth of the River Jacques Cartier, but opposite the Parish\r\nof Champlain; in the next, no shipwreck was ever suffered by Jacques\r\nCartier, who wintered in fact at the mouth of the little river St.\r\nCharles. The tradition as to his shipwreck, and to the loss of one of his\r\nvessels, most probably arose from the well known circumstance of his\r\nhaving returned to France with two ships, instead of three, with which he\r\nleft St. Malo. Having lost so many men by scurvy during his first winter\r\nin Canada, he was under the necessity of abandoning one of them, which lay\r\nin the harbour of Ste. Croix. The people of Champlain having possessed\r\nthemselves of the old iron to be found on the vessel, it of course soon\r\nfell to pieces, and in process of time arose the tradition that Jacques\r\nCartier had been shipwrecked. The removal of the scene of his supposed\r\ndisaster from the St. Charles to the River Jacques Cartier. was an error\r\nof Charlevoix.\r\n\r\nBefore we conclude this notice of Verazzani: it may be mentioned, that in\r\nthe Strozzi Library at Florence, is preserved a manuscript, in which he is\r\nsaid to have given with great minuteness, a description of all the\r\ncountries which he had visited during his voyage, and from which, says\r\nTiraboschi, we derive the intelligence, that he had formed the design, in\r\ncommon with the other navigators of that era, of attempting a passage\r\nthrough those seas to the East Indies. It is much to be desired, that some\r\nItalian Scholar would favor the world with the publication of this\r\nmanuscript of Verazzani.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[_See pages_ 71-72.]\r\n\r\n_THE FRENCH WHO REMAINED IN QUEBEC AFTER ITS CAPITULATION TO THE BRITISH\r\nIN 1629._\r\n\r\n(_From the Canadian Antiquarian_)\r\n\r\nIn Canadian annals there is no period veiled deeper in Cimmerian darkness,\r\nthan the short era of the occupation of Quebec by the English under Louis\r\nKirke, extending from the 14th July 1629, to 13th July, 1632. The absence\r\nof diaries, of regular histories, no doubt makes it difficult to\r\nreconstruct, in minute details, the nascent city of 1629. Deep researches,\r\nhowever, in the English and French archives have recently brought to the\r\nsurface many curious incidents. To the Abbé Faillon, who, in addition to\r\nthe usual sources of information had access to the archives of the\r\nPropaganda at Rome, the cause of history is deeply indebted, though one\r\nmust occasionally regret his partiality towards Montreal which so often\r\nobscures his judgment. Another useful source to draw from for our\r\nhistorians, will be found in a very recent work on the conquest of Canada\r\nin 1629 by a descendant of Louis Kirke, an Oxford graduate, it is\r\npublished in England.\r\n\r\nThose who fancy reading the present to the past, will be pleased to meet\r\nin those two last writers a quaint account of the theological feud\r\nagitating the Rock in 1629. Religious controversies were then, as now, the\r\norder of the day. But bluff Commander Kirke had a happy way of getting rid\r\nof bad theology. His Excellency, whose ancestors hailed from France, was a\r\nHuguenot, a staunch believer in John Calvin. Of his trusty garrison of 90\r\nmen a goodly portion were calvinists, the rest, however, with the chaplain\r\nof the forces, were disciples of Luther. The squabble, from theology,\r\ndegenerated into disloyalty to the constituted authorities, a conspiracy\r\nwas hatched to overthrow the Governor's rule and murder Kirke. His\r\nReverence the Lutheran minister was supposed to be in some way accessory\r\nto the plot, which Kirke found means to suppress with a high hand, and His\r\nReverence, without the slightest regard to the cut of his coat, was\r\narrested and detained a prisoner for six months in the Jesuit's residence\r\non the banks of the St. Charles, near Hare Point, from which he emerged,\r\nlet us hope, a wiser, if not a better man. History has failed to disclose\r\nthe name of the Lutheran minister.\r\n\r\nElsewhere [332] we have furnished a summary of the French families who\r\nremained in Quebec in 1629, after the departure of Champlain and\r\ncapitulation of the place to the British. Students of Canadian history are\r\nindebted to Mr. Stanislas Drapeau, of Ottawa, for a still fuller account,\r\nwhich we shall take the liberty to translate.\r\n\r\n\"Over and above the English garrison of Quebec, numbering 90 men, we can\r\nmake out that twenty-eight French remained. The inmates of Quebec that\r\nwinter amounted to 118 persons, as follows:\r\n\r\n1.

G. and A. B. Wyon have now on\r\nview, at 287 Regent Street, impressions from the seals of the four\r\nprovinces of Canada and the Great Seal of the Dominion, just completed,\r\nwith the gold medal that has been struck in commemoration of the union of\r\nthe provinces. They are all designed and executed in a very high style of\r\nart. Of the seals, that for the Dominion is, of coarse, the largest. It\r\nrepresents the Queen seated under a Gothic canopy and holding the ball and\r\nsceptre, while the wings of the canopy contain the shields of the\r\nProvinces--two on either side--hanging on the stem of an oak. These Gothic\r\ncanopies occupy nearly the whole of the middle space of the seal, the\r\nground between them and the border is covered with a rich diaper, and a\r\nshield bearing the Royal Arms of England fills the space beneath the\r\ncentre canopy. The border of the seal bears the inscription, \"Victoria,\r\nDei Gratia, Britanniae Regina, F. D. In Canada Sigillum.\" This work would\r\nadd to the reputation of any other seal engraver, though it can hardly do\r\nso to that of the Messrs Wyon, whose productions have long enjoyed a high\r\nand deserved celebrity. The seal is well filled, as it should be in a\r\nGothic design, but it is not crowded, the ornaments are all very pure in\r\nstyle, and the whole is in the most perfect keeping. The execution is not\r\nless remarkable, the relief is extremely high in parts (although it does\r\nnot at first appear to be so, owing to the breadth of the composition),\r\nbut, in spite of this difficulty, the truth, sharpness, and finish of\r\nevery part have been preserved as well as they could possibly be on a\r\nmedal, or even on a coin. The smaller seals for the provinces are engraved\r\non one general design. The crown surmounts a central shield bearing the\r\nRoyal Arms, below which is a smaller shield bearing the arms of the\r\nparticular province--New Brunswick, Ontario, Quebec, or Nova Scotia. The\r\nRoyal motto on a flowing ribbon fills up the space at the sides; a border\r\nadapted to the outline of the design runs outside this, and touches the\r\ncircular border of the seal containing the legend. These seals are no less\r\nremarkable for carefulness of execution than the one to which we have\r\nreferred. The medal which has been struck to commemorate the confederation\r\nof the provinces is in solid gold, and is so large and massive that its\r\nvalue in metal alone is £50. On the obverse there is a head of the Queen,\r\nfor which Her Majesty recently gave Mr. Wyon sittings; the reverse bears\r\nan allegorical design--Britannia seated and holding the scroll of\r\nconfederation, with figures representing the four provinces grouped around\r\nher. Ontario holds the sheaf and sickle; Quebec, the paddle; Nova Scotia,\r\nthe mining spade; and New Brunswick the forest axe. Britannia carries her\r\ntrident and the lion crouches by her side. The following inscription runs\r\nround a raised border: \"Juventas et Patrius Vigor Canada Instaurata 1867.\"\r\nThe relief on this side is extremely bold, and the composition, modelling\r\nand finish are such as to leave little to be desired. The treatment of the\r\nhead on the obverse is broad and simple; the hair is hidden by a sort of\r\nhood of flowing drapery confined by a plain coronet, and the surface is\r\nbut little broken anywhere. The ornaments are massive rather than rich;\r\nthere is a plain pendant in the ear, and a miniature of the Prince Consort\r\nis attached to a necklace of very chaste design.\"--_Morning Chronicle,\r\nQuebec._\r\n\r\n[_See page_ 148.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_MILITIA UNIFORMS._\r\n\r\nCanadian militiamen will be interested in the following letter which\r\nappeared in the Toronto _Globe_.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I observe in your \"Notes from the Capital\" a paragraph to the effect\r\nthat Major-General Luard has taken exception to the gold lace worn by\r\ncertain arms of the active militia. I am aware that this point has been\r\nraised before, and perhaps it is not a very material issue; but there is a\r\nfeature--an historical one--in connection with the subject that deserves\r\nattention, and I remember when the militia was more active than now, in\r\nthe face of danger to the peace of the country, this historical point was\r\nbrought into prominence. I simply suggest that a certain warrant signed by\r\nthe King after the war of 1812 be unearthed. I believe it lies somewhere\r\nin the militia archives, having been transferred from the Public Record\r\nOffice. According to an old officer, now dead, who was familiar with it,\r\nthis warrant authorises the Canadian militia--a royal force, by the way--\r\nto wear the same uniform as His Majesty's \"Royal Regiments.\" Hence it is\r\nthat the characteristic features of the royal livery has been assumed by\r\nthe artillery and the other arms of the service. My informant, who had\r\nserved in 1812, also stated that it was owing to an accident that silver\r\nwas assumed in 1862, the contractor in London, who supplied, in great\r\nhaste, uniforms for the militia at the time of the Trent affair, assuming\r\nthat \"militia\" uniforms must be after the style of the English force,\r\nwhich bears silver ornaments. The Canadian militia is, of course, on a\r\ndifferent footing, and takes precedence after the regular army. I think,\r\ntherefore, that for the sake of history and the prominent position of the\r\nCanadian militia in a warlike sense, and in view of services rendered,\r\nsuch as no other militia in the British service ever rendered, this point\r\nis worthy of revival and investigation. Apart from this there is the fact\r\nthat a change of dress is a source of expense and embarrassment to\r\nofficers. I have served in various corps for seventeen years, and I know.\r\nL. A. M.

Le 16 juillet 1665 on débarqua à Québec douze chevaux, les\r\npremiers envoyés de France par le Roi. Il était naturel que les sauvages,\r\nà qui ces animaux étaient entièrement inconnus, témoignassent une grande\r\nsurprise en voyant ces _orignaux de France_: c'est ainsi qu'ils les\r\nappelaient, par comparaison avec ces animaux du pays, n'ayant pas de mots\r\ndans leur langue pour les désigner. Ce qu'ils admiraient surtout,\r\nc'étaient qu'ils fussent si traitables et si dociles sons la main de leurs\r\ncavaliers, qui les faisaient marcher à leur fantaisie. [333] Sa Majesté a\r\nencore envoyé des chevaux, écrivait en 1667 la mère Marie de\r\nl'Incarnation, et on nous a donné pour notre part deux belles juments et\r\nun cheval, tant pour la charrue que pour le charroi. [334] \"L'année 1670,\r\nle Roi envoya pareillement un étalon et douze juments, et les fit\r\ndistribuer aux gentilshommes du pays, les plus zélés pour la culture des\r\nterres: une jument à M. Talon, deux juments à M. de Chambly avec un\r\nétalon, une à M. de Sorel, une à M. de Contrecoeur, une à M. de Saint-\r\nOurs, une à M. de Varenne, deux juments à M. de Lachesnaye, une à M. de\r\nLatouche, une à M. de Repentigny, enfin la douzième à M. Le Ber. Voici les\r\nconditions auxquelles le Roi faisaient ces sortes de dons aux\r\nparticuliers, ils devaient les nourrir pendant trois ans: et si par leur\r\nfaute, quelqu'un de ces animaux venaient à mourir, celui à qui il avait\r\nété donné était obligé de donner au receveur du Roi la somme de deux cents\r\nlivres. Dans l'autre cas, il pouvait le vendre après les trois ans\r\nexpirés, ainsi que les poulains qu'il aurait pu avoir; mais avec charge au\r\nbout de trois ans, de donner au receveur de Sa Majesté un poulain d'un an\r\npour chaque cheval, ou la somme de cent livres. Il était pareillement\r\nordonné que, lorsque ces poulains que le Roi faisait élever et nourrir\r\nseraient parvenus à leur troisième année, on les distribuer ait à d'autres\r\nparticuliers, et toujours aux mêmes conditions. [335] Comme on le voit,\r\nces conditions ne pouvaient être plus avantageuses aux particuliers, ni au\r\npays en général; aussi Colbert, qui avait tant à coeur de voir fleurir la\r\ncolonie, écrivait à M. Talon, le 11 février 1671. \"Je tiendrai la main à\r\nce qu'il soit envoyé en Canada des cavales et des ânesses, afin de\r\nmultiplier ces espèces si nécessaires à la commodité des habitants.\" [336]\r\nDe tous les animaux domestiques envoyés par le Roi dans la Nouvelle-\r\nFrance, les chevaux furent, en effet, ceux qui s'y multiplièrent le plus,\r\nquoique le nombre des autres y augmentât d'une manière étonnante.

From this port the shipments were 4,000 head of cattle, 17,274\r\nsheep, and 188 hogs; or a grand total from the two shipping ports of\r\n21,112 head of cattle; 77,181 sheep and 3,656 hogs. The estimated value of\r\nthis live stock is--cattle, $1,111,200; sheep, $771,810; and hogs,\r\n$52,720; or a grand total of $2,935,730. The value of the forage exported\r\nwith this stock for food, averaging the trip of each steamship at ten\r\ndays, is placed at $92,690; and the estimated sums paid to the various\r\nsteamship lines for freight is $583,900.--[Quebec _Mercury_, 24th Nov.,\r\n1879.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[_See page_ 200.]\r\n\r\n_SHIP-BUILDING AT QUEBEC UNDER FRENCH DOMINATION._\r\n\r\n\"La construction des vaisseaux était une autre branche d'industrie que\r\nLouis XIV avait à coeur d'introduire en Canada; et dans ce dessin, il eut\r\nsoin d'y faire passer tous les ouvriers nécessaires, ainsi que d'autres,\r\npour préparer des bois propres à cette construction et les transporter en\r\nFrance. Peu après son arrivée en Canada, M. Talon donna tous ses soins à\r\nun objet de si grande importance. \"Il faut couper des bois de toute sorte,\r\nlit-on dans la Relation de 1667, qui se trouvent par tout le Canada, et\r\nqui donnent facilité aux Français et aux autres, qui viennent s'y\r\nhabituer, de s'y loger dès leur arrivée.

[340] L'un de ces bâtiments étant enfin achevé, on\r\ndemanda au Roi qu'il voulût bien le laisser dans la colonie, ce qui\r\npourtant n'eut pas lieu.\" [341]--_Histoire de la Colonie Française en\r\nCanada_, Faillon, Vol. III, p. 256.\r\n\r\nExtract from \"_Mémoires et Relations sur l'Histoire Ancienne du Canada_\r\nd'après des Manuscrits récemment obtenus des Archives et Bureaux Publics,\r\nen France.\"\r\n\r\n(Publiés sous la direction de la Société Littéraire et Historique de\r\nQuébec, 1840. (1748.))--\"Il y a une Construction royale établie à Québec;\r\nle Roy y entretient un Constructeur-en-chef, et tous les ouvriers\r\nnécessaires; mais cette construction est aujourd'hui décriée, et l'on dit\r\nque le Roy va la faire cesser pour les raisons suivantes:\r\n\r\nEn premier lieu, on prétend que les vaisseaux bâtis à Québec coûtent\r\nbeaucoup plus que ceux bâtis dans les ports de France; mais on n'ajoute\r\npas que ce n'est qu'en apparence, attendu qu'il passe sur le compte de la\r\nconstruction beaucoup de dépenses qui n'y ont aucun rapport.\r\n\r\nEn second lieu, que ces vaisseaux jusqu'a présent ont été de très-peu de\r\ndurée; d'où l'on conclut que les bois du Canada ne valent rien.\r\n\r\nPour juger sainement de la qualité de ces bois, il faut entrer dans le\r\ndétail de ce qui en regarde la coupe, le transport à Québec, et l'employ à\r\nla construction.\r\n\r\nPremièrement: Ces bois du Canada sont extrêmement droits, ce n'est qu'avec\r\nbeaucoup de peine qu'on trouve dans leurs racines des bois tords, propres\r\nà la construction.\r\n\r\nDeuxièmement: Jusqu'à présent on n'a exploité que les Chênières les plus\r\nvoisines des rivières, et conséquemment situées dans les lieux bas, a\r\ncause de la facilité de transport.\r\n\r\nTroisièmement: Les bois sont coupés en hiver; on les traîne sur la neige\r\njusques au bord des rivières et des lacs; lorsque la fonte des neiges et\r\ndes glaces a rendu la navigation libre, on les met en radeaux pour les\r\ndescendre à Québec, où ils restent longtems dans l'eau, avant d'être tirés\r\nà terre, et où ils en contractent une mousse qui les échauffe; encore\r\nimbibés d'eau, ils sont exposés dans un chantier à toute l'ardeur du\r\nsoleil de l'été; l'hiver qui succède les couvre une seconde fois de neige,\r\nque le printems fait fondre, et ainsi successivement jusqu'a ce qu'ils\r\nsoient employés; enfin, ils restent deux ans sur les chantiers, où de\r\nnouveau ils essuyent deux fois l'extrémité du froid et du chaud qu'on sent\r\ndans ce climat.\r\n\r\nVoilà les causes du peu de durée de ces vaisseaux:\r\n\r\nSi on coupoit les bois sur les hauteurs; s'ils étoient transportés à\r\nQuébec dans des barques; si on les garantissoit des injures du tems dans\r\ndes hangars, et si les vaisseaux ne restoient qu'une année sur les\r\nchantiers il est évident qu'ils dureroient plus longtems. Dans la\r\ndémolition de ceux qui ont été condamnés en France, on a reconnu que les\r\nbordages s'etoient bien conservés, et qu'ils étoient aussi bons que ceux\r\nqu'on tire de Sède; mais que les membres en étoient pourris. Est-il\r\nétonnant que les bois tords pris à la racine d'arbres qui avoient le pied\r\ndans l'eau qu'on n'a pas eu attention de faire sécher à couvert,\r\ns'échauffent quand ils se trouvent enfermés entre deux bordages?\r\n\r\nJe ne vois donc pas que les raisons alléguées centre les vaisseaux de\r\nQuébec soient suffisantes pour en faire cesser la construction. Je dis\r\nplus, que le Roy fait en Canada, celle de la construction me paroit la\r\nplus nécessaire, et celle qui peut devenir la plus utile. Tout esprit non\r\nprévenu sera forcé de convenir qu'on y fera construire des vaisseaux avec\r\nplus d'économie que dans les ports de France, toutes les fois qu'on ne\r\nconfondra pas d'autres dépenses avec celles de la construction.\r\nD'ailleurs, il est important qu'il y ait à Québec un certain nombre de\r\ncharpentiers et de calfats; il en manque aujourd'hui, malgré ceux que le\r\nRoy entretient; et lorsque les particuliers en ont besoin au printems, ils\r\nn'en trouvent point; un calfat se paye six francs pour une marée. J'avoue\r\nqu'alors tous les travaux de cette espèce sont pressés; mais ordinairement\r\nun charpentier gagne trois à quatre francs par jour avec les particuliers.\r\nIndépendamment de l'intérêt des particuliers, les vaisseaux qui viennent à\r\nQuébec, ont quelques fois besoin d'un radoub, et dans le nombre des\r\nnavires marchands, il y en a toujours quelqu'un qu'il est nécessaire de\r\nradouber par des accidents arrivés dans la traversée. Si le Roy faisoit\r\ncesser ici la construction de ses vaisseaux, tous les ouvriers qui y sont\r\nemployés seroient forcés d'aller chercher du travail ailleurs.\r\n\r\nEnfin, on a besoin en Canada de petits bâtiments pour les postes de la\r\npêche, pour le commerce de Québec, à Montréal, pour le cabotage de la\r\nrivière, pour la traite à Gaspé et à Louisbourg; et cette partie de la\r\nconstruction est si fort négligée ici, que les Anglois de ce continent\r\nfournissent une partie des bâtimens pour la navigation dans l'intérieur de\r\nnotre Colonie. Ce n'est pas que leurs bois sont meilleurs, ou leurs\r\nbâtimens mieux construits que les nôtres, mais ils les donnent à meilleur\r\nmarche. Aussi voyons-nous dans toutes nos places maritimes des navires\r\nmarchands construits dans la Nouvelle-Angleterre.\r\n\r\nLoin donc de prendre le parti d'abandonner la Construction royale, parti\r\npréjudiciable à la Colonie, et j'ose dire à l'État, il seroit nécessaire\r\nnon-seulement que le Roy continuât à faire construire des vaisseaux en\r\nCanada, mais encore qu'il encourageât des entrepreneurs pour la\r\nconstruction de bâtimens marchands. La gratification de vingt francs par\r\ntonneau, accordée aux particuliers qui feroient passer en France des\r\nbâtimens construits en Canada, ne suffroit pas aujourd'huy pour les\r\nengager à cet égard dans des entreprises d'un certaine considération; la\r\nmain d'oeuvre est hors de prix, et les entrepreneurs seraient forcés de\r\nfaire venir de France les voiles, cordages et autres agrès.\r\n\r\nIl faudroit, indépendamment de la gratification, que le Roy fît passer à\r\nQuébec une partie de ses agrès, et qu'il les donnât aux entrepreneurs à un\r\nprix raisonnable: il faudroit en outre qu'il leur procureroit un frêt pour\r\nles bâtimens qu'ils envoyeroient en France, et il le leur procureroit en\r\nordonnant qu'on reçut dans ses ports les planches, bordages, merrains,\r\nplançons de chêne, mâtures et autres articles de cette espèce, dont ces\r\nbâtimens seroient chargés, au même prix qu'il les paye aux fournisseurs\r\nqui tirent tous ces articles de l'étranger; en prenant ces mesures, le\r\nCanada fourniroit les bâtimens nécessaires pour le commerce intérieur de\r\nla Colonie, dispenseroit la France d'avoir recours aux Anglois pour les\r\nnavires qui manquent à son commerce en Europe, et que les Anglois\r\nconstruisent dans le même continent où nous avons de si vastes\r\npossessions; les mâtures du Canada, estimées autant que celles que nous\r\ntirons du Nord à grands frais, ne seroient pas pour nous en pure perte;\r\nces exploitations devenant considérables, faciliteroient la culture des\r\nterres, en désertant des cantons qui, peut-être, ne le seront jamais;\r\nenfin cette construction, établie sur le pied où on le propose, coûteroit\r\nsans doute, au Roy; mais cette dépense, sagement économisée, feroit partie\r\nde celles que nous avons dit être nécessaires pour la balance du commerce\r\nde cette Colonie avec la France.\"\r\n\r\nI have furnished elsewhere, a sketch and a tabular statement showing the\r\ngradual progress in ship-building, under French Rule and under English\r\nRule, from 1787 down to 1875.--_Vide_ QUEBEC PAST AND PRESENT, page 434-9.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_See page 219._]\r\n\r\n_THE CONQUEST OF NEW YORK._\r\n\r\n\"Louis XIV,\" says Parkman, \"commanded that eighteen thousand unoffending\r\npersons should be stripped of all they possessed, and cast out to the\r\nmercy of the wilderness.

Daniels, containing a\r\nsuccinct history of one of the earliest Massachusetts towns--the town of\r\nOxford; we think we cannot introduce it to the reader more appropriately,\r\nthan in the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, whose graceful introduction\r\nprefaces the volume.\r\n\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes to George F. Daniels:--\"Of all my father's\r\nhistorical studies,\" says the Autocrat of the Breakfast-table, \"none ever\r\ninterested me so much as his 'Memoir of the French Protestants who settled\r\nat Oxford, in 1686,'--all the circumstances connected with that second\r\nColony of Pilgrim-Fathers, are such as to invest it with singular\r\nattraction for the student of history, the antiquary, the genealogist. It\r\ncarries us back to the memories of the massacre of Saint Bartholomew, to\r\nthe generous Edict of Nantes, and the gallant soldier-king, who issued it;\r\nto the days of the Grand Monarque, and the cruel act of revocation which\r\ndrove into exile hundreds of thousands of the best subjects of France--\r\namong them the little band which was planted in our Massachusetts half-\r\ntamed wilderness. It leads the explorer who loves to linger around the\r\nplaces consecrated by human enterprise, efforts, trials, triumphs,\r\nsufferings, to localities still marked with the fading traces of the\r\nstrangers who, there found a refuge for a few brief years, and then\r\nwandered forth to know their homes no more. It tells the lovers of family\r\nhistory where the un-English names which he is constantly meeting with--\r\nBowdoin, Faneuil, Sigourney--found their origin, and under what skies were\r\nmoulded the type of lineaments, unlike those of Anglo-Saxon parentage,\r\nwhich he finds among certain of his acquaintance, and it may be in his own\r\nfamily or himself. And what romance can be fuller of interest than the\r\nstory of this hunted handful of Protestants leaving, some of them at an\r\nhour's warning, all that was dear to them, and voluntarily wrecking\r\nthemselves, as it were, on this shore, where the savage and the wolf were\r\nwaiting ready to dispute possession with the feeble intruders. They came\r\nwith their untrained skill to a region where trees were to be felled, wild\r\nbeasts to be slain, the soil to be subdued to furnish them bread, the\r\nwhole fabric of social order to be established under new conditions. They\r\ncame from the sunny skies of France to the capricious climate where the\r\nsummers were fierce and the winters terrible with winds and snows. They\r\nleft the polished amenities of an old civilization, for the homely ways of\r\nrude settlers of another race and language. Their lips, which had shaped\r\nthemselves to the harmonies of a refined language, which had been used to\r\nspeaking such names as Rochefort and Beauvoir and Angoulême, had to\r\ndistort themselves into the utterances of words like Manchaug and\r\nWabquasset and Chaubunagungamang. The short and simple annals of this\r\nheroic and gentle company of emigrants are full of trials and troubles,\r\nand ended with a bloody catastrophe.\r\n\r\n'After Plymouth, I do not think there is any locality in New England more\r\ninteresting. This little band of French families, [343 ] transported from\r\nthe shore of the Bay of Biscay to the wilds of our New England interior,\r\nreminds me of the isolated group of Magnolias which we find surrounded by\r\nthe ordinary forest trees of our Massachusetts town of Manchester. It is a\r\nsurprise to meet with them, and we wonder how they came there, but they\r\nglorify the scenery with their tropical flowers, and sweeten it with their\r\nfragrance. Such a pleasing surprise is the effect of coming upon this\r\nsmall and transitory abiding-place of the men and women who left their\r\nbeloved and beautiful land for the sake of their religion. The lines of\r\ntheir fort may become obliterated, 'the perfume of the shrubbery may no\r\nlonger be perceived but the ground they hallowed by their footsteps is\r\nsacred and the air around their old Oxford home is sweet with their\r\nmemory.'\r\n\r\nThis exclusiveness in the selection of settlers for Canada, ever since the\r\ndays of the DeCaens, to render the population homogeneous and prevent\r\nreligious discord, was extended to Frenchmen, whose only disability, was\r\ntheir faith, and who did not belong to the national Church, and though the\r\ncolony, more than once was at its last gasp, for want of soldiers and\r\ncolonists to defend it, it was forbidden ground to the 500,000 industrious\r\nFrenchman, whom the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1682, drove to\r\nEngland, Holland and Germany, and the English and Dutch colonies in\r\nAmerica. This policy of exclusiveness, was vigorously denounced by the\r\nleading historian of Canada, F. X. Garneau, in 1845.\r\n\r\n\"The poorly expressed request, for fifteen hundred colonists to take the\r\nplace of those who had joined the army, remained unanswered--unattended\r\nto. Though at the very time the Huguenots solicited as a favour permission\r\nto settle in the New World, where they promised to live peaceably under\r\nthe shadow of their country's flag--which they could not cease to love--it\r\nwas just when they were denied a request, which had it been granted would\r\nhave saved Canada and permanently secured it to France. But Colbert's\r\ninfluence,\" says Garneau, \"at Court had fallen away; he was on his death-\r\nbed. So long as he was in power he had protected the Calvinists, who had\r\nceased to disturb France and who then were enriching it. His death which\r\ntook place in 1684, handed them over to the tender mercy of the Chancellor\r\nLe Tellier and of the fierce Louvois. The _dragonnades_ swept over\r\nthe protestant strongholds, awful heralds of the revocation of the edict\r\nof Nantes. The king, said a celebrated writer, exhibited his power by\r\nhumbling the Pope and by crushing the Huguenots. He wished the unification\r\nof the Church and of France--the hobby of the great men of the day,\r\npresided over by Bossuet. Madame de Maintenon, a converted Calvinist, and\r\nwho had secretly become his wife (1685) encouraged him in this design and\r\nsuggested to him the cruel scheme of tearing away children from their\r\nparents, to bring them up in the Roman Catholic faith. The vexatious\r\nconfiscations, the galleys, the torture of the wheel, the gibbet,--all\r\nwere successively but unsuccessfully resorted to as a means to convert\r\nthem. The unhappy Protestants' sole aim was to escape from the band which\r\ntortured them, in vain were they prohibited from quitting the kingdom, and\r\nthose who aided them in their flight sent to the galleys--five hundred\r\nthousand escaped to Holland, to Germany, to England, and to the English\r\ncolonies in America. They carried thither their wealth, their industry,\r\nand after such a separation--ill blood and thirst for revenge, which\r\nsubsequently cost their native country very dear. William III, who more\r\nthan once charged the French troops at the heads of French regiments, and\r\nRoman Catholic and Huguenot regiments, were seen, when recognising one\r\nanother on the battle-field, to rush on one another with their bayonets,\r\nwith an onslaught more ferocious than soldiers of different nationalities\r\nexhibit to one another. How advantageous would not have been an\r\nemigration, strong in numbers and composed of men, wealthy, enlightened,\r\npeaceful, laborious, such as the Huguenots were--to people the shores of\r\nthe St. Lawrence, or the fertile plains of the West? At least, they would\r\nnot have borne to foreign lands the secret of French manufactures, and\r\ntaught other nations to produce goods which they were in the habit of\r\ngoing and procuring in the ports of France. A fatal policy sacrificed\r\nthese advantages to the selfish views of a party--armed by the alliance of\r\nthe spiritual and temporal power with an authority, which denied the\r\nbreath of life to conscience as well as to intellect. 'If you and yours\r\nare not converted, before such a day, the king's authority will ensure\r\nyour conversion,' thus wrote Bossuet to the dissenters. We repeat it, had\r\nthis policy not been resorted to, we should not be reduced, we Canadians,\r\nto defend every foot of ground, our language, our laws, and our\r\nnationality, against an invading hostile sea. How will pardon be granted\r\nto fanaticism, for the anguish and suffering inflicted on a whole people,\r\nwhose fate has been rendered so painful, so arduous--whose future has been\r\nso grievously jeopardized.\r\n\r\n\"Louis XIV, who had myriads of dragoons to butcher the Protestants, and\r\nwho by his own fault was losing half a million of his subjects--the\r\nmonarch who dictated to Europe, could only spare two hundred soldiers to\r\nsend to Quebec, to protect a country four times larger than France, a\r\ncountry which embraced Hudson's Bay, Acadia, Canada, a large portion of\r\nMaine, of Vermont, New York, and the whole Mississippi valley\"--\r\n_Garneau's History of Canada_, (Vol. I. p. 492-96--1st edition.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[See page 107.]\r\n\r\n_VENERABLE MOTHER OF THE INCARNATION._\r\n\r\n\"In one of the many works which the philosopher of Chelsea has given to\r\nthe world, we find the assertion of a great truth that history is but the\r\nbiography of leading men. The poet of Cambridge also tells us that the\r\nlives of the great are so many models, and that as they have left their\r\nfootprints on the sands of time, so may we by following their noble\r\nexample render our lives illustrious. These reflections of the philosopher\r\nand poet extend no doubt to those of the fairer sex, in whom exalted\r\nvirtue was manifested, and whose devotion in the pursuit of noble deeds\r\nawakens the spirit of emulation in all hearts. From the earliest period of\r\ntime heroic women have appeared. The mother of the Maccabees, the mother\r\nof the Gracchi, the grand prophetesses whose actions are recorded in that\r\nsublimest of books, the Bible--these and many others adorn the pages of\r\nhistory, whether sacred or profane, and afford living, ever-present\r\nproofs, that the pathway of glory and honour may be pursued by even the\r\nweaker members of the human race.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, youthful though her record may be, there have appeared\r\nactresses on the great stage of humanity, whose virtues appeal for\r\nadmiration, whose nobility of soul provokes general reverence, and whose\r\nimpress upon the future destinies of the country is of a more profound\r\nnature than may be imagined at first sight.\r\n\r\nForemost among such heroic women, may be regarded the foundress of the\r\nUrsuline Convent in Quebec, the Venerable Mother Mary of the Incarnation.\r\nGifted by nature, burning with zeal for the welfare of souls, imbued with\r\nthe greatest confidence in the mercies of a bountiful Creator, she fully\r\nrealized the great idea of Blessed Angela de Merici, that the preservation\r\nof the world from innumerable evils, largely depended upon the correct\r\ntraining of youth. Born in sunny France, she braved the dangers of the\r\ndeep, so that on our virgin soil she might plant the pure, untainted flag\r\nof Christian education; and, now that the Province of Quebec has emerged\r\nfrom the lowliness of its early condition--now that the settlers by the\r\nbanks of the St. Lawrence have become a great people, with a literature\r\nall their own, rich in its very youthful exuberance, with their language\r\npreserved, and the free exercise of their religion guaranteed no less by\r\nthe faithful adherence to treaty obligations, than by their own hardy\r\ndevotion, we can calmly review the past, and gratefully acknowledge the\r\nblessings bestowed on the country through the instrumentality of that lady\r\nwho founded that holy sisterhood in our midst, which daily labours to\r\nhonour the Intelligence of God, by the cultivation of intellectual graces.\r\nFew, indeed, are the families in Quebec which have not experienced the\r\nvalue of the Ursuline community in our city. One of the crowns of\r\nwomanhood is gained in Christian education--an education which falls upon\r\nthe soil of the soul, like freshening dew, and adorns the heart and mind\r\nwith the flowers of virtue. Hence the life of the Venerable Mother Mary\r\nshould be carefully studied and pondered over; hence her deeds should be\r\nproclaimed and her saintly legacies preserved, and therefore, it is, that\r\nthe writer humbly calls attention to a new work, written by a daughter of\r\nErin, written lovingly and sweetly in the quiet precincts of the Ursuline\r\nConvent, Blackrock, Cork, and in which may be found the story of the\r\ndevoted French woman, whose name is now inseparably linked with that of\r\nCanada, told in chaste language worthy alike of the virtuous theme, and of\r\nthe ability which marks the narration. The earlier days of the French\r\nColony are depicted therein; and with an accuracy no less commendable than\r\nuseful. In fact the book is eminently a readable one, the object of the\r\npublication being to extend the knowledge which all of us ought to possess\r\nof one whose life glorified God, and whose advent to our shores was a very\r\nbenediction.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES JOSEPH GAHAN.\r\n\r\nQuebec, 27th January, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe copy the following from the _Quebec Gazette_, 10th October, 1793:--\r\n\r\nTHE VARIATION OF THE NEEDLE AT QUEBEC.\r\n\r\n\"For the information of the curious, the particular benefit of Land\r\nSurveyors, and safety of seafaring people, please to insert in your\r\n_Gazette_, that from critical observation on the variation of the\r\nneedle at Quebec, it is found to be on the decrease, or in other words to\r\nbe again returning to the Eastward,--a proof of which is, that in 1785,\r\nwhen the Meridian line on Abraham's Plains was ascertained by me, the\r\nvariation was found to be 12 degrees, 35 minutes West; whereas at present\r\nthe variation is no more than 12 degrees, 5 minutes West, having in the\r\nspace of eight years diminished half a degree.\r\n\r\n  I am sir,\r\n\r\n  Your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n  (Signed,) SAMUEL HOLLAND.\r\n\r\n  Quebec, 8th October, 1793.\r\n\r\nHow do matters now stand, Commander Ashe?\r\n\r\n\"VARIATION OF THE NEEDLE AT QUEBEC.\"\r\n\r\n(_To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle._)\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--\"For the information of the curious, the particular benefit of\r\nLand Surveyors, and safety of sea-faring people,\" I will endeavor to\r\nexplain how our compass variation stands.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the reprint from the _Quebec Gazette_ of 1793, in the\r\nChronicle of the 23rd instant, in which Major Samuel Holland observes that\r\nhe had passed our Maximum Westerly Variation, it is very likely that such\r\nwas the case, as I find that Major Sabine in 1818, found the Variation for\r\nLondon to be 24° 30' West, and in 1822 to have retrograded to 24° 12':\r\nthis was not only the case in England, but all over Europe where\r\nobservations were taken, so that there is no doubt that the same\r\ndisturbing influence was affecting the needle here in 1793. Whatever that\r\ninfluence is, it must shortly alter. Major Samuel Holland's observations\r\nhave affected us in the opposite direction, for in 1860 Captain Bayfield\r\nfound the variation for Quebec to be 15° 45' West, with an annual increase\r\nof 5', which would give the present variation as about 17° 0' West. This\r\nagrees very closely with observations taken here last November for\r\ndeviation, which with range of only 7° 30', gave a mean result of 17° 3'\r\n9\" West.   I am, &c,\r\n\r\nE. D. ASHE,\r\nCommander R. N.\r\n\r\nObservatory, Quebec, Feb. 23rd, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\n_OUR CITY BELLS--THEIR NAMES._\r\n\r\n1st.

To the weary and drowsy traveller, steeped at dawn in that\r\n\"sweet restorer, balmy sleep,\" under the silent eaves of the St. Louis or\r\nStadacona hotel, this is one of the features of our city life, at times\r\nunwelcome. We once heard a hardened old tourist savagely exclaim,\r\n\"Preserve me against the silvery voice of Quebec Evening _Belles_, I\r\nrather like your early Morning Bells.\" Another tourist, however, in one of\r\nour periodicals closes a lament over Quebec \"Bell Ringing,\" with the\r\ncaustic enquiry \"Should not Bell Bingers be punished?\"\r\n\r\nBeing more cosmopolitan in our tastes, we like the music of our City Bells\r\nin the dewy morn, without fearing the merry tones of our City _Belles_,\r\nwhen the silent shades of evening lends them its witchery. There is\r\ncertainly as much variety in the names as there is in the chimes of our\r\nQuebec Bells.\r\n\r\nThough the Bells of the \"ancient capital\" are famous in history and song,\r\nQuebec cannot boast of any such monsters of sound as the \"Gros Bourdon\" of\r\nMontreal--weighing 29,400 lbs., dating from 1847, \"the largest bell in\r\nAmerica.\" The R. C. Cathedral in the upper town, raised in 1874, by His\r\nHoliness, Pius IX to the high position of _Basilica Minor_, the only one\r\non the continent--owns two bells of antique origin; the Parish Register\r\ntraces as follows, their birth and christening. \"1774--9th October.

The second, was called PIERRE MARIE, by M. Panet,\r\nJudge of the Court, and his wife Marie Anne Rottot; said bell weighing\r\n1,268 lbs.\"\r\n\r\nA halo of poetry hovers over some of our bells. About 1829, Adam Kidd, a\r\nson of song, hailing from Spencer Wood,--a friend of the Laird of the\r\nManor--Hon. H M Percival, wrote some graceful lines on the _Church\r\nBells_ of the General Hospital Convent. This poem was published at the\r\n_Herald_ and _New Gazette_ office, in Montreal. In 1830, with the _Huron\r\nChief_, and other poems by Kidd, and by him inscribed to Tom Moore, \"the\r\nmost popular, most powerful and most patriotic poet of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, whose magic numbers have vibrated to the heart of nations,\" says\r\nthe Dedication.\r\n\r\nA delightful volume has recently been put forth by a Ursuline Nun,\r\nentitled \"GLIMPSES OF THE MONASTERY,\" in which the holy memories of the\r\ncloister blend with exquisite bits of word painting; we find in it a\r\nglowing sketch of the Convent Bells, and of the objects and scenery,\r\nsurrounding the \"Little World\" of the Ursulines. \"Marriage Bells\" are of\r\ncourse left out.\r\n\r\nThe writer therein alludes to that short-lived bell of Madame de la\r\nPeltrie, melted in the memorable fire of the 31st December, 1650, which\r\nthe pious lady used to toll, to call \"the Neophytes to the waters of\r\nbaptism, or the newly made Christians to Holy Mass.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(_See page 113._)\r\n\r\n(_From \"Trifles from my Diary.\"_)\r\n\r\n\"_GENERAL WOLFE'S STATUE,\" CORNER PALACE STREET_\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"MAPLE LEAVES.\"\r\n\r\n   Olim truncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum,\r\n  Cum faber, incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum\r\n  Maluit esse Deum.\r\n                            Horace, Sat I. 8.\r\n\r\nHenry Ward Beecher begins an amusing sketch of our city with the words,\r\n\"Queer old Quebec,--of all the cities on the Continent of America, the\r\nquaintest.\" He concludes his humorous picture by expressing the wish that\r\nit may remain so without being disturbed by the new-fangled notions of the\r\nday. Some one has observed that its walls, streets, public places,\r\nchurches and old monasteries, with the legends of three centuries clinging\r\nto them, give you, when you enter under its massive gates, hoary with age,\r\n[344] the idea of an \"old curiosity shop,\" or, as the name Henry Ward\r\nBeecher well expresses it, \"a picture book, turning over a new leaf at\r\neach street.\" It is not then surprising that the inhabitants should have\r\nresorted not only to the pen of the historian to preserve evergreen and\r\nfragrant the historical ivy which clings to its battlements, but even to\r\nthat cheap process, in use in other countries, to immortalize heroes--\r\nsignboards and statues--a process recommended by high authority. We read\r\nin that curiously interesting book, \"History of Signboards--\"\r\n\r\n\"The Greeks honored their great men and successful commanders by erecting\r\nstatues to them; the Romans rewarded their popular favorites with\r\ntriumphal entries and ovations; modern nations make the portraits of their\r\ncelebrities serve as signs for public-houses:\r\n\r\n  Vernon, the Butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,\r\n  Prince Ferdinand, Granby, Burgoyne, Keppel, Howe,\r\n  Evil and good have had their tithe of talk,\r\n  And filled their signpost then, like Wellesley now.\"\r\n\r\nIf Wolfe served as a signboard recently in Britain, he has filled the same\r\noffice now close on a century in Canada, and still continues to do so. He\r\nhas defied wind and weather ever since the day when the Cholette Brothers\r\naffixed to the house at the north-west corner of St. John and Palace\r\nstreets a rough statue of the gallant young soldier in the year 1771, with\r\none arm extended in the attitude of command, and pointing to the Falls of\r\nMontmorency.\r\n\r\nNor has Mr. de Gaspé, the author of the \"Canadians of Old,\" thought it\r\nbeneath his pen to indite an able disquisition on its origin, brimful of\r\nwealth for our antiquaries and a great deal more practical in its bearings\r\nthan even Jonathan Oldbuck's great Essay on Castrametation. A Three Rivers\r\nantiquarian had attempted to establish that it was Ives Cholette who had\r\nbeen the sculptor of the statue in question, but our old friend (through\r\nthe church registers--and through ancient and irrefutable records) showed\r\nit could neither be Ives Cholette, aged, in 1771, 10 years, nor his\r\nyounger brother Hyacinthe, aged then but 8 years, who had designed this\r\ngreat work of art, but Cholette of another ilk. [345]\r\n\r\nIn these halycon days of old Quebec, free from municipal taxes, Fenian\r\nscares and labor strikes, when the practical joker [346] and _mauvais\r\nsujets_, bent on a lark, would occasionally take possession, after\r\nnight-fall, of some of the chief city thoroughfares, and organize a\r\nmasquerade, battering unmercifully with their heavy lanterns. Captain\r\nPinguet's _hommes de guêt_,--the night patrol--long before Lord Durham's\r\nblue-coated \"peelers\" were thought of, the historic statue would disappear\r\nsometimes for days together; and after having headed a noisy procession,\r\ndecorated with _bonnet rouge_ and one of those antique camloteen cloaks\r\nwhich our forefathers used to rejoice in, it would be found in the morning\r\ngrotesquely propped up, either in the centre of the old Upper Town market,\r\nor in the old Picote cemetery in Couillard street [347], in that fanciful\r\ncostume (a three-storied _sombrero_, with eye-glass and _dudeen_) which\r\nrendered so _piquant_ some of the former vignettes on the Union Bank\r\nnotes. I can yet recall as one of the most stirring memories of my\r\nchildhood, the concern, nay, vexation, of Quebecers generally when the\r\n\"General\" was missing on the 16th July, 1838, from his sacred niche in\r\nPalace street, and was subsequently triumphantly replaced by the grateful\r\ncitizens,--rejuvenated, repainted, revarnished, with the best materials\r\nHalifax could furnish, the \"General\" having been brought there by the\r\nyoungsters of the \"Inconstant\" frigate, Captain Pring, from Quebec. It\r\nwould appear the roystering middies, having sacrificed copiously to the\r\nrosy god, after rising from a masonic dinner in the Albion Hotel, in\r\nPalace street, had noticed the \"General\" by the pale moonlight, looking\r\nvery seedy, and considering that a sea voyage would set him up, had\r\ncarried him on board. The General was driven down in a calèche by Colvin\r\nof St. Louis street--a carter--through Palace Gate, standing erect; the\r\nsentry presenting arms, as if he were saluting the officer of the night.\r\nHe was safely introduced through a port-hole, the seaman of the watch,\r\nshaking his head knowingly, saying--\"One of our swells pretty tight, I\r\nguess.\" From Halifax \"General Wolfe\" sailed for Bermuda--thence to\r\nPortsmouth, at both of which places he was jauntily set up as a signboard;\r\na short time after he was re-shipped to Halifax, packed in a box, with his\r\nextended arm sawn off lying by his side. Fearing, however, the anger of\r\nthe Quebec authorities, the \"General\" was painted afresh and returned by\r\nthe \"Unicorn\" steamer, \"Cape Douglas,\" which plied between the Lower\r\nPorts,--with the \"Inconstants'\" best regards to their Quebec friends, and\r\nbest wishes for the General's health and safety.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the journal of the venerable Jas. Thompson, the\r\nlast survivor of Wolfe's army, who expired at the ripe age of 98 years--in\r\n1830, throws light on this matter. This anecdote was reduced to writing,\r\nand by request forwarded by him to His Excellency the Earl of Dalhousie,\r\nthrough his A.D.C. and brother Col. Ramsay. \"We had a loyal fellow in\r\nQuebec, one George Hipps, a butcher, who owned that house at the corner of\r\nPalace and John streets, still called 'Wolfe's Corner,' and as it happened\r\nto have a niche, probably for the figure of a saint, [348] he was very\r\nanxious to fill it up, and he thought he could have nothing better than a\r\nstatue of General Wolfe; but he did not know how to set about getting one.\r\nAt last he found out two French sculptors, who were brothers--of the name\r\nof Cholette, and asked me if I thought I could direct them how to make a\r\nlikeness of the General in wood. I said I would, at all events, undertake\r\nit, and accordingly the Cholettes tried to imitate several sketches I gave\r\nthem; but they made but a poor job of it after all; for the front face is\r\nno likeness at all, and the profile is all that they could hit upon. The\r\nbody gives but a poor idea of the General, who was tall and straight as a\r\nrush. So that after my best endeavors to describe his person, and I knew\r\nit well, for which purpose I attended every day at their workshop which\r\nwas in that house in St. Louis street where the Misses Napier are now\r\n(1828) residing, [349] and which is somewhat retired from the line of the\r\nstreet, the shop itself being on the projecting wing--I say that we made\r\nbut a poor \"General Wolfe\" of it. It has been several times--the house\r\nbeing only one storey high--pulled down by mischievous persons and broken,\r\nand as often repaired by the several owners of the house; and, much to\r\ntheir credit be it spoken, it still keeps its ground, and I hope it will\r\ndo so until the monument is finished. [350]\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that the original parts of the statue must be as rotten as a\r\npear and would be mouldered away if it was not for their being kept so\r\nbedaubed with paint.\"\r\n\r\nNote.--Officers of H.B.M. frigate \"Inconstant,\" Capt.

APRIL, 1874\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY--A SAD SPECTACLE\r\n\r\n\"At the very moment of its departure, and when the entire city was\r\nrejoicing in the longed-for event--at the very time when the glad news was\r\nflashing over the wires to Montreal and the West, that Nature's barrier to\r\nthe uninterrupted navigation of the St. Lawrence was so slowly floating\r\naway--we regret to say that the ice-bridge of 1874 was making itself\r\nmemorable yesterday to Quebec in a shape more formidable than its perverse\r\ntenacity or its injurious effects upon trade. It was rioting in a perfect\r\norgie of destruction, crushing man's handwork in its passage like so much\r\nfrail glass in the grasp of a giant. At 3.20 p.m., when the glad\r\nannouncement passed from mouth to mouth that the ice was moving, it began\r\nits destructive work. The scene was at Blais Booms and the immediate\r\nneighborhood, where the Government steamers _Napoleon III_ and _Druid_,\r\nthe Gulf Ports steamers _Georgia_, _Miramichi_ and _Hadji_ and a large\r\nnumber of tug steamers and other craft belonging to the St. Lawrence Tow\r\nBoat Company and other parties were in winter quarters and have been in\r\nthe habit of so doing for years on account of the superior facilities and\r\nsafety offered by the place. Nearly a hundred craft of all kinds,\r\nsteamers, ships, schooners, and barges, were here congregated, moored in\r\nmany instances together and extending over a line of nearly 300 yards. The\r\nfloating ice as it came down, struck the outside craft--a sailing vessel,\r\nwe believe--driving it against its neighbor, the _Georgia_, and then\r\nhurrying both of them against the others, jamming them against each other\r\nand against the wharves in inextricable confusion and causing a tremendous\r\namount of damage, if not irreparable loss. Some were stove in, filled with\r\nwater and sunk, only leaving their bows or masts above water to mark where\r\nthey had gone down, while others disappeared from view altogether.\r\nFortunately no lives were lost. The loss and damage to property cannot\r\nfall far short, we believe, of a million of dollars. The following is a\r\nsummary of the accident:\r\n\r\nGovernment steamer _Napoleon III_ driven against the Mariner's Chapel\r\nwharf had her side completely stove in; full of water and almost keeled\r\nover, very badly damaged, and will cost a heavy sum to repair. She had\r\nsteam up at the time, but could not move out. Broke her cables and lost\r\nher anchors.\r\n\r\nGulf Ports steamer _Georgia_--Hole stove in her side; hold, full of\r\nwater. Damage easily repaired.\r\n\r\nGulf Ports SS. _Hadji_--Singular to say, though the boat was in the\r\nvery middle of the confused mass, it received no damage worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nGulf Ports SS. _Miramichi_--very slightly damaged. Will be extricated\r\nto-day and proceed to her wharf, to sail for below on Tuesday next.\r\n\r\nGovernment steamer \"Druid,\"--on her beam ends, slightly damaged.\r\n\r\nSteamboat \"Napoleon,\"--keeled over,\r\n\r\nSteamboat \"Mersey,\"--on her side.\r\n\r\nSteamboat \"Canada,\"--sunk.\r\n\r\nSteamboat \"Beaver,\"--sunk, completely disappeared.\r\n\r\nSteamboat \"Castor\"--disappeared.\r\n\r\nSteamboat \"Rival\"--badly damaged.\r\n\r\nSteamboat \"Shannon,\"--badly damaged.\r\n\r\nSteamboat \"Rescue,\"--sunk, lies under the bows of the \"Miramichi.\"\r\n\r\nSteamboat \"Conqueror No. 1,\"--badly damaged.\r\n\r\nA schooner, owned by Mr. Kennedy, of Gaspé, laden with provisions, and\r\nwhich was detained here last fall, was also sunk and lies near the\r\n\"Georgia.\" In addition two of Mr. H. H. Hall's blocks or piers were\r\ncompletely carried away by the crushing weight of the ice.\"--(Quebec\r\nBudget.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[_See page 317_.]\r\n\r\n _THE PISTOLS AND SASH OF GENERAL WOLFE_, 1759.\r\n\r\n(_To the Editor of the Morning Chronicle_.)\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Would you allow me to supply in your columns additional\r\ninformation on an incident relating to the siege of Quebec in 1759. By the\r\nfollowing documents, which come to me with every guarantee of reliability\r\nin the writer, it would appear that the gallant General Wolfe, before\r\nexpiring on the Plains of Abraham, on the 13th of Sept, 1759, bequeathed\r\nhis pistols and sash to one of the surgeons who attended him. Dr. Elihu or\r\nEdward Tudor was a Welshman, born in 1733. He graduated at Yale College,\r\n1750, joined the English army in 1755, was present at the taking of\r\nQuebec, and left the service about 1767, receiving a pension and grant of\r\nland from the English Government. These relics are now in the possession\r\nof Dr. Tudor's grand daughter, Mrs. Strong, at Monkton, awaiting farther\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n  I remain, Dear Sir,\r\n\r\n  Yours, &c.\r\n\r\n  J. M. LeMoine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_STATE OF VERMONT_,\r\n\r\nSENATE CHAMBER,\r\n\r\nMONKTON, April 26th, 1875.\r\n\r\nJ. M. LeMoine, Esq., Literary and Historical Society, Quebec.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Please find enclosed statement of Mrs. Strong relative to the\r\npistols and sash of Gen. Wolfe. You will undoubtedly remember that I wrote\r\nto you last winter, and that you answered asking for something more\r\nauthentic. Consequently I drew up a set of questions, leaving after each\r\nquestion space for answer. Now I return them to you. There is no question\r\nin the minds of people here about the facts as stated by Mrs. Strong. The\r\nauthority of the matter is as established here as that Mr. Harrower is\r\nproprietor of Gen. Montgomery's sabre. I should be very happy to receive\r\none of the books that are being prepared of that era in the history of\r\nQuebec.\r\n\r\n  I have the honor, sir, of being at your service, G. E. SMITH.\r\n\r\n  STRONG AND MIDDLEBROOKE,\r\n\r\n  VERGENNES, Vt., 1875.\r\n\r\nDr. Elihu or Edward was descended from Owen Tudor, who came from Wales\r\nwith the Puritans, was born 1733, graduated at Yale College 1750, joined\r\nthe army 1755, was at the taking of Quebec and the Havana; about 1767; he\r\nwas discharged and returned to his native place; he received a pension\r\nduring his life, and also a grant of land from the English Government.\r\n\r\nThe above statement is made by C. W. Strong, of the above firm.\r\n\r\n  C. E. SMITH\r\n\r\nWill Mrs. Strong please answer the following questions:--\r\n\r\nWhat is your maiden name?--Sarah Tudor.\r\n\r\nWhat was your father's name in full and profession?--Edward Tudor,\r\neducated at Philadelphia as Physician, Surgeon and Dentist.\r\n\r\nWhat was your grandfather's name and profession?--Elihu Tudor, Physician\r\nand Surgeon,--generally wrote it _Edward_, as he disliked the name of\r\n_Elihu_.\r\n\r\nWhen and where was he born?--Feb. 1733, Windsor, Conn.\r\n\r\nWhen and where did he die?--East Windsor, Conn., 1826.\r\n\r\nWas he Surgeon on Gen. Wolfe's staff's at Quebec in 1759?--He was.\r\n\r\nHow do you know that your grandfather Tudor attended upon Gen. Wolfe when\r\nhe was wounded on the 13th Sept., 1759, at Quebec?--I have often heard my\r\ngrand father relate the circumstances and other interesting reminiscences\r\nof the General.\r\n\r\nWhat is the history or tradition as you have it that Gen. Wolfe gave your\r\ngrandfather his pistols?--The history he (my grandfather) gave was only,\r\nthat they were given him at the death of Gen. Wolfe.\r\n\r\nDescribe them--They are rifle breech-loaders, London maker, Flint Locks,\r\nsilver mounted, with English coat of arms on butt; the sash was cut up;\r\nDr. Strong has a piece; it is stained.\r\n\r\nHave you them in your possession?--My son, Dr. Edward Strong, of Crown\r\nPoint, N. Y., has them.\r\n\r\nHave you the sash worn by Surgeon Tudor at the time the General was\r\nkilled?--The sash was three yards long, Crimson silk. It was Gen. Wolfe's\r\nsash given to my grandfather.\r\n\r\nWhat is said of stains of blood upon it from the wound that caused Wolfe's\r\ndeath?--It was rent with the shot, and stained with his blood.\r\n\r\n  MRS. SARAH TUDOR STRONG.\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE POST OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\"In a recent issue of the _Journal des Trois Rivières_ appeared a\r\nsomewhat interesting paper on the Canadian postal system. From this paper\r\nwe learn that on the cession of this country to Great Britain a regular\r\nmail courier was established between the cities of Montreal and Quebec.\r\nThe celebrated Benjamin Franklin was the Deputy Postmaster General for the\r\nEnglish colonies from 1750 to 1774. In 1776 this functionary, while giving\r\nevidence before a committee of the British Parliament, stated that, as a\r\nrule, the mail courier kept the route by the water highways, seldom\r\npenetrating into the interior. From his evidence, also, we learn that the\r\nmail communication between Quebec and Montreal was not more frequent than\r\nonce a month. For not having established intermediate post-offices between\r\nthe two towns, Franklin alleged the great distance between the settlers on\r\nthe banks of the St. Lawrence, the isolation of the Canadian villages, and\r\nthe excessive difficulty of intercommunication in his day. The fact is,\r\nhowever, that Benjamin Franklin was a great enemy to Canadian prosperity,\r\nand always looked with aversion upon the people of the newly-acquired\r\ncolony. In 1774, war having broken out between the mother-country and the\r\nEnglish colonies, Franklin was deprived of his office, and Mr. Hugh\r\nFinlay, a subordinate of the great republican philosopher, was appointed\r\nDeputy Postmaster General for Canada. Mr. Finlay had been given great\r\nproofs of capacity under the previous _régime_, and being a man of\r\nvery high character and probity, he was armed with large discretionary\r\npowers to put the mail system of Canada on a better footing, and to make\r\nits operations more extended and regular. Until 1790, there were added but\r\ntwo intermediate post-offices between Quebec and Montreal; in the year\r\nfollowing, offices were opened at Three Rivers and Berthier. Every month,\r\nhowever, a mail messenger was sent by way of Halifax to England. At this\r\ndate the local mail betwixt Quebec and Halifax was bi-weekly in summer,\r\nand once a week in winter; the local mail between Quebec and Montreal had\r\nincreased to twice a week. In 1800, Mr. Hugh Finlay was succeeded in\r\noffice by Mr. George Heriot. This gentleman, being also commissioned as\r\nDeputy Postmaster General for New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, as well as\r\nfor the two Canadas, had to oversee the service throughout all these\r\nprovinces and to visit them from time to time. In the four first years of\r\nhis administration he opened but one new post-office in Lower Canada, and\r\nfive in the Upper Province. Matters progressed slowly enough until 1816,\r\nwhen Mr. David Sutherland succeeded Mr. Heriot. In 1817 be opened six\r\nadditional offices of delivery in Lower Canada which made the total number\r\nof offices in operation thirteen. Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island\r\nwere placed under the management of independent offices, and in that year\r\nthe mails were still expedited but weekly to New Brunswick. In 1824, Mr.\r\nSutherland was succeeded by Mr. Thomas Allen Stayner, and it was in this\r\nyear that New Brunswick was endowed with an independent postal department.\r\nMr. Stayner administered his important office for the space of twenty-\r\nseven years, with great zeal and giving entire satisfaction to the public.\r\nHe greatly increased the number of local offices, and inaugurated many of\r\nthe reforms which have since developed into that vast and safe system of\r\ncommunication with which our people are so familiar. On the 6th of April,\r\n1851, the Canadian Mail Department was transferred from the Imperial to\r\nProvincial control, the first Postmaster General being the Hon. John\r\nMorris. Some idea of the progress made from 1760 to 1851, a period of\r\nninety years, may be obtained by contrasting the department under Benjamin\r\nFranklin and that over which Mr. Morris was called to preside. The\r\ncourier, who made monthly journeys on horseback between the military posts\r\nof Quebec and Montreal, and whose safe arrival at either of those then\r\ndistant cities would no doubt cause the utmost satisfaction to the King's\r\nlieges, male and female, had been replaced by the steamboat and soon would\r\nbe by the railway; and the two primitive post offices of Canada had\r\nexpanded into a network of 601 local offices, transmitting among them\r\nletters to the number of 2,132,000 annually. In 1861 these figures had\r\nattained to 1775 offices, and the number of letters transmitted to\r\n9,400,000; in addition to a weekly line of ocean mail steamers to Europe,\r\nover 1200 miles of railway doing mail service from one end of Canada to\r\nthe other, and a magnificent network of telegraphic wire supplementing the\r\npostal system. What the number of offices and of letters carried may have\r\nbeen for the last year ending July 1867, when the postal systems of the\r\nDominion were again placed under one head, we have not at hand, but we may\r\nstate that during the official term of Hon. Mr. Langevin, now Secretary of\r\nState, the revenue from this source attained almost $900,000.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1851, the system of cheap postage was tried in Canada, the\r\nrate being reduced from an average one of fifteen cents to a uniform rate\r\nof five cents for prepaid and seven cents for unpaid letters. In the\r\nfollowing year this reform resulted in doubling the number of letters\r\ncarried, with the reduction of only one-third of the previous revenue; and\r\nin a short time the receipts not only increased to the former figure but\r\ngreatly exceeded it. Under the new system we expect this reform in the\r\ncharge for postage will be greatly extended.\"--(_Quebec Mercury_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[_See page 263._]\r\n\r\n_MONUMENT OF THE VICTIMS OF 1837-'38_\r\n\r\n\"_L'Ordre_ newspaper announces the completion of the monument in the\r\nCôte des Neiges Cemetery to the memory of the victims of 1837-38. It\r\nrequired many efforts and great energy to bring to a completion a work\r\nwhich had unhappily encountered many difficulties. For some months,\r\nfurnished with sums collected either by a special or general subscription,\r\nor the proceeds of concerts and pleasure excursions, the Committee applied\r\nthemselves to the work, and on Sunday they went to take possession from\r\nMr. T. Fahrland, architect, and Mr. L. Hughes, the constructor of the\r\nmonument. The inauguration will take place next summer.\r\n\r\nSituated on the highest elevation of the Cemetery, this monument commands\r\nthe vast resting place of the dead.

It is played with a ball, weighing 1-\r\n3/4 oz., made of \"gutta percha\" and a set of clubs of various construction\r\nsuitable for the different stages of the game; the play is over an\r\nextended grass common or \"Links.\" At St. Andrew in Scotland, for instance,\r\nthe ground \"Links\" over which the game is played, extends in length about\r\ntwo miles and the circuit \"out and home\" is about four miles; over this\r\nspace, circular holes of about four inches in diameter are placed, in all\r\neighteen holes, from a quarter of a mile to one-half or one-third of the\r\ndistance apart. The game is interspersed with what in golfing language are\r\ncalled \"hazards,\" that is sand bunkers and whins, and all the skill\r\nrequired is to avoid these, reach each hole, and hole the ball in the\r\nfewest possible number of strokes. Of course the distance and number of\r\nholes varies according to the extent of ground available for play in\r\ndifferent localities; at Quebec, for instance, the \"round\" consists in 14\r\nholes, extending from the racquet court westward to Perrault's Hill, and\r\nmaking a circuit back to the \"home hole\" or the point from which the game\r\nstarted. The game is played by two persons or by four (two of a side)\r\nplaying alternately. They commence by each party playing off from a place\r\ncalled a \"tee\" near the first hole; the ball must afterwards be played\r\nfrom wherever it lies and the hole is won by the party holing in fewest\r\nstrokes; hereafter the balls are again teed and so on at each hole over\r\nthe whole course. All golf clubs as a rule have an annual competition for\r\na medal or other trophy; sometimes the rule is that all must compete on\r\nequal terms; at others the players are handicapped, that is odds are given\r\naccording to the player's supposed skill or want of skill, and in awarding\r\nthe prize the odds thus given are deducted from the aggregate score made\r\nby the player--thus, say a player is handicapped or receives the odds of\r\nten strokes and holes the round in 80, his odds being deducted makes him\r\nstand 70 in the competition; he therefore wins as against another\r\ncompetitor whose aggregate score is 71, but who received no odds.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF MEMBERS--QUEBEC GOLF CLUB.\r\n\r\nPATRON:\r\nHis Excellency, the MARQUIS OF LORNE, Governor-General of Canada.\r\n\r\n_Captain_:\r\nC.

It was played in early times by two Kings of Scotland, hence the\r\nprefix \"Royal;\" hence also, perhaps, the custom of players wearing red\r\ncoats while at play. In the \"Memorials of Edinburgh in the olden time,\" by\r\nDr. Daniel Wilson, President of the University College, Toronto, and\r\nProfessor of History, we read that King Charles I was engaged in the game\r\nof Golf on Leith links when, in November, 1641, a letter was handed to him\r\nwhich gave the first news of the Rebellion in Ireland. On reading the\r\nletter, he suddenly called for his coach, and leaving a few of his\r\nattendants in great agitation, he drove to Holyrood palace, from whence he\r\nset out next day for London. This was undoubtedly his last game in\r\nScotland, and probably the last game of Golf he played.\r\n\r\nIt will he observed that His Excellency the Marquis of Lorne is Patron of\r\nthe Quebec Club. His Excellency is not on the list as a mere figurehead;\r\nhe is a golfer, and plays an excellent game, as shewn in the Reports of\r\nmedal day games.\r\n\r\n\r\n_QUEBEC SNOW-SHOE CLUB._\r\n\r\nFounded In 1876.\r\n\r\nColours: RED and BLACK.\r\n\r\nThis Club, which counts upwards of 60 members in its ranks, meets weekly\r\nduring the snow-shoe season; it has three rendezvous, viz., at Hamels on\r\nthe Cap Rouge Road, at Belleau's, on the St. Foye Road, and at\r\nChamberlain's near Beauport. At these tramps the members amuse themselves\r\nwith chess, cards, draughts, singing, &c, to 11 P.M., when supper is\r\nserved. The club is conducted on strictly temperance principles.\r\n\r\nThe Annual Concert of the Club, usually held in the Music Hall, is looked\r\nfor by the Quebec public with pleasure In 1881, one of the largest\r\naudiences ever collected in the Music Hall, attended the annual concert.\r\n\r\nThe Hall was decorated with flags, devices, wreaths, snow-shoes most\r\ningeniously arranged. It was a most brilliant and enjoyable _soirée._\r\nThe various LaCrosse, the Golf and the Snow-shoe Clubs, tend very much to\r\ndevelop the muscle of our city youths, combining healthy exercise, with\r\npleasure and health.\r\n\r\nSubjoined will be found the names of the Q.

Holloway, with the\r\nfollowing address:--\r\n\r\n_To Alfred Holloway, Esquire, from the members of the Quebec Snow-shoe\r\nClub._\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--We, your fellow-members of the Quebec Snow-Shoe Club,\r\nacknowledging the indefatigable zeal yon have always shewn for the\r\nprosperity of the club, beg to offer for your acceptance the accompanying\r\nlocket and chain as a small token of regard. It is the spontaneous tribute\r\nof the members in recognition of your many fine qualities as a companion,\r\nand to mark our appreciation of your efforts to make our meetings\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nThe success and pleasure of the many winter tramps were in no small\r\nmeasure due to the bright and cheerful manner you always displayed in\r\nencouraging and enlivening the journey, and thus your impromptu songs at\r\nour place of meeting, on the route, were inimitable, and were, we assure\r\nyou, thoroughly enjoyed. These pleasant and invigorating snow-shoe rambles\r\nand entertainments will ever remain a green spot in our memories.\r\n\r\nThat the Quebec Snow-Shoe Club may long continue to enjoy the benefit and\r\ninfluence of your agreeable company is the heartfelt desire of us all.\r\n\r\n  R. HARCOURT SMITH,\r\n    President.\r\n  HARRY WOODS,\r\n    Secretary.\r\n\r\n  14th March, 1881.\r\n\r\nThe locket and chain which were presented to Mr. A. Holloway were made by\r\nMr. G. Seifert, the locket having upon it a pair of crossed snow-shoes and\r\ntuque with a monogram of the club beautifully raised on the one side, and\r\non the back, were engraved the following words: \"Presented to Mr. Holloway\r\nby the members of Q. S. S. C., 24th March, 1881.\" The address was\r\nhandsomely illuminated by the Nuns of the Good Shepherd Convent, and\r\nreflects great credit upon them for the artistic manner in which it is got\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n_FRENCH GOVERNORS OF CANADA_.\r\n\r\n(LIST PREPARED BY FRED A.

The Governors of these three districts,\r\nduring what is commonly called the period of military rule, from Sept. 8,\r\n1760, to Aug. 10, 1764,\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n  District of Quebec,\r\n    Gen.

The white whales floundering in\r\nthe Bay of Tadousac, and the wild duck diving as the foaming prow drew\r\nnear,--there was no life but these in all that watery solitude, twenty\r\nmiles from shore to shore. The ship was from Honfleur, and was commanded\r\nby Samuel de Champlain. He was the Aeneas of a destined people, and in her\r\nwomb lay the embryo life of Canada.\" (_Pioneers of France in the New\r\nWorld_, p. 296.)\r\n\r\n[7] Champlain calls Cape Diamond, Mont du Gas (Guast), from the family\r\nname of De Monts. He gives the name of Cape Diamond to Pointe à Puiseaux.\r\nSee map of Quebec (1613.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n[8] Six French Governors died and were buried in Quebec--Samuel de\r\nChamplain, Count de Frontenac, M. de Mesy, De Callières, Marquis de la\r\nJonquière, and Marquis de Vaudreuil. Two English Governors--Lieut. Gen.\r\nHope and the Duke of Richmond.\r\n\r\n[9] Up to 1617, and later, Cbamplain's residence was in the Lower Town,\r\nand stood nearly on the site of the Church _of Notre-Dames des Victoires_.\r\n\r\n[10] John London MacAdam, the inventor of macadamized roads, was born in\r\nAyr, Scotland, on the 21st September, 1756, and died at Moffat on the 26th\r\nNovember, 1836. The Parliament of Great Britain voted £2,000 to this\r\nbenefactor of the human race. Macadamized roads, like several other useful\r\ninventions, met with many obstacles in Quebec. Some of the loudest to\r\ndenounce this innovation were the carriage builders, who augured that good\r\nroads, by decreasing the bills for repairs to carriages, would ruin their\r\nindustry, that their \"usefulness would be gone.\"\r\n\r\n[11] _Jesuit's Journal_, page 89. _Vide_ Appendix--Verbo, Horses.\r\n\r\n[12] The _Journal des Jésuites_, published by Geo. Desbarats in 1874,\r\nunder the supervision of the learned Abbés Laverdière and Casgrain, from\r\nthe copy in the Archives of the Quebec Seminary, though fragmentary,\r\nthrows valuable light on many points in Canadian History. We clip the\r\nentry for 1st January, 1646, as summarized in the _Glimpses of the\r\n(Ursuline) Monastery_, respecting the custom of New Year's visits and\r\npresents; this entry will further introduce us to some of the denizens of\r\nnote in Quebec in 1646:--We meet with the first _seigneur_ of Beauport,\r\nSurgeon Robert Giffard, who had settled there in 1634; the Royal Engineer\r\nand Surveyor, Jean Bourdon; J. Bpte. Couillard, the ancestor of the Quebec\r\nCouillards, of late years connected by marriage with the Quebec DeLérys;\r\nMdlle. de Repentigny, a high-born French lady; the founder of the\r\nUrsuline Monastery, the benevolent Madame de la Peltrie; the devoted\r\nSillery missionary, Father de Quen; without forgetting our old Scotch\r\nfriend, Pilot Abraham Martin, who, from the nature of the gift bestowed,\r\nit seems, could relish his glass, and evidently was not then what we now\r\ncall a \"Neal Dow man.\"\r\n\r\nJanuary, 1st, 1646.--The soldiers went to salute the Governor with their\r\nguns; the inhabitants presented their compliments in a body. He was\r\nbeforehand with us, and came here at seven o'clock to wish us a 'Happy New\r\nYear,' addressing each of the Fathers one after another. I returned his\r\nvisit after Mass. (Another time we must be beforehand with him.) M.\r\nGiffard also came to see us. The hospital nuns sent us a letter of\r\ncompliment early in the morning; the Ursulines also, with beautiful\r\npresents, wax candles, rosaries, a crucifix, and, at dinner, two excellent\r\npigeon-pies. I sent them two images, in enamel, of St. Ignatius and St\r\nFrancois Xavier. We gave to M. Giffard the 'Life of Our Lord,' by F.\r\nBonnet; to M. des Châtelets, a little volume of Drexellius on Eternity; to\r\nM. Bourdon, a telescope and compass, and to others, reliquaries, rosaries,\r\nmedals, images, etc. We gave a crucifix to the woman who washes the Church\r\nlinen, a bottle of rum to Abraham, and four handkerchiefs to his wife;\r\nsome books of devotion to others, and two handkerchiefs to Robert Haché;\r\nhe asked for more and we gave them to him. I went to see M. Giffard, M.\r\nCouillard and Mademoiselle de Repentigny. The Ursulines sent to beg I\r\nwould come and see them before the end of the day. I went; and paid my\r\ncompliments also to Madame de la Peltrie, who had sent us presents. I was\r\nnear leaving this out, which would have been a great oversight. At home, I\r\ngave to our Fathers and Brothers what I thought they would like best. I\r\nhad given beforehand to F. De Quen, for Sillery, all he chose to take from\r\nmy room, and a choice present for Father Masse.\"--_Journal_, p. 24.\r\n\r\n[13] Histoire de la Colonie Française en Canada, Vol. III., p. 384.\r\n\r\n[14] History of Emily Montague, 4 Vols., 1767--London.\r\n\r\n[15] The \"dear man,\" in a concluding paragraph, dated 1st July, 1766, to\r\nJohn Temple, Esq., Pall-Mall, London, says: \"Adieu! I am going to attend a\r\nvery handsome French lady, who allows me the honour to drive her _en\r\ncalashe_ to our Canadian Hyde Park, the road to St. Foix, where you\r\nwill see forty or fifty calashes, with pretty women in them, parading\r\nevery evening.\"--(_History of Emily Montague, Vol. I., p. 25._) The\r\nhandsome Colonel Rivers, who so fancied his drives on the Foye road in\r\n1766, the writer was told by Hon. W. Sheppard, was no other than the\r\ngallant Colonel Henry Caldwell, Wolfe's Assistant Quartermaster-General at\r\nthe battle of the Plains, in 1759--the \"Laird of Belmont\"--who died at\r\nQuebec in 1810, a friend, no doubt, of the clever Mrs. Brookes who wrote\r\nthis novel.\r\n\r\n[16] Histoire de l'Hôtel-Dieu de Québec (Mère Juchereau, 511.)\r\n\r\n[17] Histoire de l'Hôtel-Dieu, Casgrain, p. 81.\r\n\r\n[18] To Let.--That elegant house, No. 6 Port Louis Street, lately occupied\r\nby H.R.H.

The matter was then proposed, and an\r\nanswer returned very shortly, thus: _Quaero an existimes_, vel, _id jus\r\nest, nec ne? Secundum ea, quae proponuntur, existimo, placet, puto._--\r\n(_Adams' Roman Antiquities_, 201.)\r\n\r\nLawyers gave their opinions either by word of mouth or in writing,\r\ncommonly without any reasons annexed, but not always.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers of these days do not, as a rule, see their clients quite so\r\nearly in the morning as those of Rome did.\r\n\r\n  Agricolam laudat juris legumque peritus\r\n  Sub galli cantum, consultor ubi ostia pulsat.\r\n\r\n  Romae dulce diu fuit et solemne, reclusa\r\n  Mane domo vigilare, clienti promere jura.\r\n\r\n[24] La Hontan, I., 21 (Ed. 1705). In some editions the above is expressed\r\nin different language--(From Parkman's _Old Regime_, p. 270.)\r\n\r\n[25] It lines a space in rear, on which the Imperial Government erected,\r\nfor the British troops in garrison, the Military Hospital. Since 1872, it\r\nis used as a temporary Court House, in lieu of the old Court House, built\r\nin 1814, and destroyed by fire in 1871. A high wall to the south-east,\r\nencloses a lofty eminence surmounted by a flagstaff--the _Mont Carmel_\r\nmentioned by La Potherie, Charlevoix and other old writers. The French had\r\na _Cavalier_ here. A little Eden of flowers, adjacent to the residence of\r\nthe member for the County of Quebec, Hon. Adolphe P. Caron, Minister of\r\nMilitia, and son of the late Lieutenant-Governor, Hon. R. E. Caron, now\r\nenlivens this eminence. On the same side of the street, about one hundred\r\nfeet to the east, facing Parloir street, still exists a high-peaked old\r\ntenement, to which a livery stable is attached. This house is said to\r\noccupy the site on which, in 1759 stood the dwelling of Dr. Arnoux, Jr.,\r\nthe French surgeon under whose roof the gallant Montcalm was brought about\r\nnoon, on his way from the lost battle of the Plains.\r\n\r\n[26] Smith's _History of Canada_, Vol. II, p. 92. _Diary of Siege of_\r\n1776. _Lit. and Hist. Society Pub., fourth series_, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[27] In accepting the _Château St. Louis_ as the spot where Montcalm\r\nexpired, we still wish to leave the question an open one. Did Montcalm\r\nexpire at the _Château_, under Dr. Arnoux's roof, at the General Hospital,\r\nas averred by Capt. John Knox, or, possibly, under his own roof on the\r\nramparts, near Hope Gate? This point is not yet cleared up. See\r\ndisquisition in _Album du Touriste_ \"Où est mort Montcalm?\"\r\n\r\n[28] On the 9th July, 1755, De Beaujeu won this brilliant victory.\r\n\r\n[29] The 8th July, 1758, has been rendered famous by Montcalm and his\r\nregulars and Canadian militia at Carillon.\r\n\r\n[30] Louis Honoré Fréchette, born at the town of Levis, opposite to\r\nQuebec--went through a classical course at the Quebec Seminary--studied\r\nfor the Bar,  recently member of parliament for his native county, Levis,\r\nunder the present Judge for the Kamouraska District, Hon. Henri\r\nTaschereau. Represented his native county of Levis in the Commons\r\nParliament from 1873 to 1878. His poetical effusions were published, at\r\nQuebec, in 1863, in a small volume, intituled \"Mes Loisirs\"; in 1877, a\r\nmore extensive collection was published under the title of \"Pêle-Mêle.\" He\r\nwas awarded in 1880, by the _Académie Française_ of Paris, the _Grand Prix\r\nMonthyon_, 2,000 francs. In April, 1881, Queen's College conferred on Mr.\r\nFréchette the degree of Doctor of Laws, and McGill University also made\r\nhim an LL.D. Since his marriage in Montreal to Mdlle.

We purpose to note the changes which have taken place\r\nsince the publication of that work only.\r\n\r\n[49] In 1808, among other notabilities on the _Rue des Pauvres_, we\r\nfind that, as appears by a notarial deed of transfer, in the Woolsey\r\nestate, before J. Plante, N.P., 28th March, 1808, a grand old relic of the\r\nCanadian _noblesse_, la Baronne de Longueuil, the widow of the late\r\nCaptain David Alexander Grant, of the 94th regiment--to whom she had been\r\nunited in wedlock at Quebec, on the 7th May, 1781. She then dwelt there in\r\na house belonging to her husband's uncle, the Honorable William Grant (who\r\nhad died at Quebec in 1805), though her usual abode was on the picturesque\r\nfamily property--on the Island of St. Helen, opposite Montreal. This\r\nisland was purchased by the Imperial authorities for military purposes\r\nabout 1815. The dignified, accomplished and queenly old Baronne expired at\r\nMontreal on the 7th February, 1841, aged 86 years. Her grandson, Charles\r\nColmore Grant, of London England, now bears the title of Baron de\r\nLongueuil, in virtue of the gracious recognition of our Sovereign, as set\r\nforth in the London (Royal) _Gazette_ of the 4th December, 1880, and\r\nCanada _Gazette_ of the 21st January, 1881.\r\n\r\n[50] The following was composed by the late Hon J.

Pantaléon Pelletier, Senator.\r\n\r\n[54] LOSSING'S FIELD BOOK, Vol. I, p. 195, thus describes the dress of the\r\ninvaders: \"Each man of the three rifle companies (Morgan's, Smith's, and\r\nHendrick's) bore a rifle barreled gun, a tomahawk or small axe, and a long\r\nknife, usually called a scalping knife, which served for all purposes in\r\nthe woods. His underdress, by no means in a military style, was covered by\r\na deep ash-coloured hunting shirt, legging and moccasins if the latter\r\ncould be procured. It was a silly fashion of those times for riflemen to\r\nape the manners of savages.\" \"The Canadians who first saw these (men)\r\nemerge from the woods, said they were _vêtus en toile_--clothed in\r\nlinen. The word _toile_ was changed to _tôle_, iron plated. By a mistake\r\nof a single word the fears of the people were greatly increased, for the\r\nnews spread that the mysterious army that descended from the wilderness\r\nwas clad in _sheet-iron_.\"\r\n\r\n[54a] \"The flag used by what was called the Continental troops, of which\r\nthe force led into Canada by Arnold and Montgomery was a part, was of\r\nplain crimson, and perhaps sometimes it may have had a border of black. On\r\nthe 1st January, 1776, the army was organized, and the new flag then\r\nadopted was first unfurled at Cambridge, at the head-quarters of General\r\nWashington, the present residence of the poet Longfellow. That flag was\r\nmade up of thirteen stripes, seven red and six white, but the Union was\r\nthe Union of the British flag of that day, blue bearing the Cross of St\r\nAndrew combined with the cross of St George and a diagonal red cross for\r\nIreland. This design was used by the American Army till after the 14th\r\nJune, 1777, when Congress ordered that the Union should be changed, the\r\nUnion of the English flag removed and in its place there should be a\r\nsimple blue field with thirteen white stars, representing the thirteen\r\ncolonies declared to be states. Since that time there has been no change\r\nin the flag except that a star is added as each new state is admitted. The\r\npresent number being thirty-eight.\"--W. O.

Mr. Joly, to watch the excavations and note the discoveries,\r\nin a luminous report, sums up the whole case. From this document, among\r\nother things, we glean that the remains of the three persons of male sex\r\nare those of:\r\n\r\n  1. Père François du Péron, who died at Fort St. Louys (Chambly) 10th\r\n     November, 1665, and was conveyed to Quebec for burial.\r\n\r\n  2. Père Jean de Quen, the discoverer of Lake St. John, who died at\r\n     Quebec, on 8th October, 1659, from the effects of a fever contracted\r\n     in attending on some of the passengers brought here that summer by\r\n     the French ship \"Saint André.\"\r\n\r\n  3. Frère Jean Liégeois, scalped 29th May, 1655, by the Agniers at\r\n     Sillery--(the historian Ferland assigns as the probable spot, the\r\n     land on which the late Lieutenant-Governor Caron built his mansion\r\n     \"Clermont,\" now occupied by Thomas Beckett, Esquire.) The remains of\r\n     this missionary, when excavated, were headless--which exactly agrees\r\n     with the entry in the _Jesuits' Journal_, May, 1655, which\r\n     states that Jean Liégeois was scalped--his head cut off and left at\r\n     Sillery, while his mutilated body, discovered the next day by the\r\n     Algonquins, the allies of the French, was brought to Sillery,\r\n     (probably the Jesuits' residence, the same solid old structure close\r\n     to the foundations of the Jesuits' chapel and monument at the foot of\r\n     the Sillery Hill, which many here have seen), from whence it was\r\n     conveyed to the Lower Town in a boat and escorted to the Jesuits'\r\n     College, with the ceremonies of the R. C. Church.\r\n\r\n[61] Three Nuns of the Hôtel-Dieu Convent, according to authorities quoted\r\nby Mr. Faucher, were buried in the vault (_caveau_) of the Jesuits'\r\nChapel. The sisterhood had been allowed the use of a wing of the Jesuits'\r\nCollege, where they removed after the conflagration of the 7th June, 1755,\r\nwhich destroyed their hospital.\r\n\r\n  4. _Mère_ Marie Marthe Desroches de Saint-François-Xavier, a young\r\n     woman of 28 years, who succumbed to small-pox on the 16th August,\r\n     1755.\r\n\r\n  5. _Mère_ de l'Enfant-Jésus, who expired on the 12th May, 1756.\r\n\r\n  6. _Mère_ de Saint-Monique, who died in July, 1756, the victim of\r\n     her devotion in ministering to the decimated crew of the ship\r\n     \"Leopard,\" sunk in the port by order of Government to arrest the\r\n     spread of the pestilential disease which had raged on the passage.\r\n     Mr. Faucher closes his able report with a suggestion that a monument\r\n     ought to be raised, to commemorate the labours and devotion of the\r\n     Jesuits, on the denuded area on which stood their venerable College.\r\n\r\n_Relation de ce qui s'est passé lors des Fouilles faites par ordre du\r\nGouvernement dans une partie des fondations du_ COLLÈGE DES JÉSUITES\r\n_de Québec, précédée de certaines observations par_ FAUCHER DE SAINT\r\nMAURICE. _Quebec.

He followed Governor Haldimand\r\nwho had sailed in the \"Atalante\" on the 26th November, 1784, to England,\r\nto sue him in an English Court of Justice for illegal arrest, and was lost\r\nat sea in the \"Shelburne\" on his return to Canada.\r\n\r\n[63] The following inscription was on the coffin plate:\r\n\r\n  (1) Count Frontenac--\"Cy gyt le Haut et Puissant Seigneur, Louis de\r\n      Buade, Comte de Frontenac, Gouverneur-Général de la Nouvelle-France.\r\n      Mort à Québec, le 28 novembre 1698.\"--(_Hist. of Canada, Smith,\r\n      Vol._ 1, _p._ 133.)\r\n\r\n  (2) Gov de Callières.--\"Cy gyst Haut et Puissant Seigneur, Hector de\r\n      Callières, Chevalier de Saint-Louis, Gouverneur et Lieutenant-\r\n      Général de la Nouvelle-France, décédé le 26 mai 1703.\"--(_Ibid.,\r\n      p._ 148.)\r\n\r\n  (3) Gov. de Vaudreuil.--\"Cy gist Haut et Puissant Seigneur, Messire\r\n      Philippe Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil, Grande Croix de l'Ordre\r\n      Militaire de Saint-Louis, Gouverneur et Lieutenant-Général de toute\r\n      la Nouvelle-France décédé le dixième octobre 1725.\"--(_Ibid.,\r\n      p._ 190.)\r\n\r\n  (4) M. de la Jonquière--\"Cy repose le corps de Messire Jacques-Pierre de\r\n      Taffanel, Marquis de la Jonquière, Baron de Castlenau, Seigneur de\r\n      Hardars-magnas et autres lieux, Commandeur de l'Ordre Royal et\r\n      Militaire de Saint-Louis, Chef d'Escadre des Armées Navales,\r\n      Gouverneur et Lieutenant-Général poor le Roy en tout la Nouvelle-\r\n      France, terres et passes de la Louisiane.

Anne, district of Three Rivers, about 1845; 7th,\r\nMrs. Hotham; 8th, George Hale; 9th, Miss Elizabeth Harriet Hale, who in\r\n1838 married Commander John Orlebar, R.N.\r\n\r\n[68] We are indebted to Professor H. LaRue, M.D., for the following notes\r\nrelative to an address delivered by him at a dinner given by the Notaries\r\nPublic in 1872:--\"The first physician who entered Quebec narrowly escaped\r\nbeing hung,\" says Dr. LaRue. \"I said that he had narrowly escaped the\r\ngallows; had he been hung I would not say it. It occurred thus:--Champlain\r\nhad just landed in the Lower Town and had laid the foundation of his\r\nabode, when some of his followers hatched a plot against his life. The\r\nscheme leaked out, the ring leader was arraigned, found guilty and hung;\r\nso far as I know, this was the first execution which took place in Canada.\r\nSome how or other, Surgeon Bonnerme, one of Champlain's followers, was\r\nmixed up in the matter, imprisoned, but his innocence having shortly after\r\nbeen established, he was acquitted. Dr Bonnerme died the following year\r\n(1609) at Quebec, of scurvy. If Bonnerme was the first physician who came\r\nto Quebec, he was not, for all that, the first medical man who landed in\r\nNew France; another had preceded him: Louis Hebert, the first citizen of\r\nQuebec and of all Canada. Before Hebert's day the French who came to\r\nQuebec came there for no other object than barter, hunting and fishing;\r\nnone had thought of settling permanently there. Louis Hebert was the first\r\nproprietor in Quebec, the first land owner in Canada; as such, historians\r\nrecognize him as the first Citizen of Quebec--the _first Canadian_: a\r\nsurgeon, let us bear in mind. Louis Hebert visited New France in 1606, two\r\nyears before the foundation of Quebec. He spent the winter of 1606-7--a\r\nmerry one--at Port Royal, Acadia, in the company of Samuel de Champlain\r\nand Lescarbot. Lescarbot was the first lawyer who found his way to New\r\nFrance; Lescarbot was the first historian of the country; he was gifted\r\nwith wit--a proclivity to mild satire; each page of his history reveals\r\nthe lawyer familiar with the Bar and its lively forensic display. The\r\nwinter of 1606-7, at Port Royal, was remarkable for good cheer; appetising\r\nrepasts, the product of the chase or of the sea, were the order of the day\r\nto that extent that Lescarbot declared that Port Royal fare was as\r\n_recherché_ as that of _Rue aux Ours_, in Paris--apparently the \"Palais\r\nRoyal\" of the French capital in those times. The third or fourth physician\r\nof New France was Robert Giffard, Seignior of Beauport, who also was the\r\nfirst settler in that parish; not only was Giffard the first resident of\r\nBeauport, but, I have reason to believe, he was also the first settler--\r\n_habitant_--of the rural districts in Canada. Thus, the first citizen of\r\nall Canada would appear to have been a physician; thus, after Champlain\r\nthe two founders of the colony would have been physicians. Giffard's Lodge\r\nwas situated on some portion of Col. Gugy's farm; the leading families of\r\nCanada look to Giffard as one of their progenitors; Archbishop Taschereau\r\nis one of his descendants.\r\n\r\n\"The first Royal Notary--_Notaire Royal_--of Canada was M. Audouard, whose\r\nfirst minute rests in the vaults of the Prothonotary of Quebec. But two\r\ndeeds at least had been executed before this first minute. The deed of\r\n_partage_ of the Hébert family (1634), and the last will of Champlain\r\n(1635). These two instruments were executed before Mêtres Duchaîne and De\r\nla Ville, _greffiers_; the _greffiers_ were _Notaires_ also. Another fact\r\nworthy of note is that the first time a Notary's services were put in\r\nrequisition was at the instance of the heirs of Hébert, the physician.\"--\r\n_Morning Chronicle_, 12th April, 1881.\r\n\r\n[69] _Chansons populaires du Canada_, &c., par Ernest Gagnon, 1865.\r\n\r\n[70] The father of French-Canadian history; born in 1809, died in 1866.\r\n\r\n[71] The tablet on his monument, in Mount Hermon Cemetery, bears the\r\nfollowing inscription:--\r\n\r\n              IN MEMORY OF ROBERT CHRISTIE, ESQ.\r\n\r\nA native of Nova Scotia, he early adopted Canada as his country, and\r\nduring a long life faithfully served her. In the War in 1812 as a Captain,\r\n4th Batt., he defended her frontier; in peace, during upwards of 30 years,\r\nhe watched over her interests as member of Parliament for the County of\r\nGaspé; and in the retirement of his later years recorded her annals as her\r\nhistorian.\r\n\r\nHe died at Quebec on the 13th October, 1856, aged 68, leaving behind him\r\nthe memory of a pure career and incorruptible character.\r\n\r\n  _Integer vitae scelerisque purus._\r\n\r\nThe inscription, which we think worthy of commendation for the chasteness\r\nand conciseness of its style, is from the pen of (the late) J.

It is the oldest church in North America. Its length is 216\r\nfeet by 108 in breadth, and is capable of containing a congregation of\r\n4,000 persons. \"It originated in a gift, in 1644, on the part of Couillard\r\nand Guillemette Hebert, his wife, of 80 perches of land in superficies,\r\nfor a parish church, on condition on the part of the _Fabrique_, or\r\nchurch authorities, that they would furnish a pew in perpetuity in said\r\nchurch for them and their successors, on their paying them a sum of 30\r\nlivres, _tournois_, at each mutation. The Church was begun in 1644\r\nand 1645, on this spot, out of collections made in the years 1643 and 1644\r\ntogether, until the price for which were sold 1,270 beaver skins--worth\r\nabout 8,000 livres--was given by the Quebec merchants. The partners of the\r\nIndia Company presented the church with a bell.\"--_Histoire abrégée de\r\nl'Église de Quebec_.\r\n\r\n[74] The Indian Fort (_Fort des Hurons_) was built to protect the\r\nunfortunate Hurons who, after the butchery of 1648-49, had sought refuge\r\nat Quebec.

He belonged to\r\none of the oldest families in England. The Lambtons had lived on their\r\nestate in the north in uninterrupted succession since the Conquest. The\r\nmale succession, it is stated, never was interrupted since the twelfth\r\ncentury. They were not, however, a family of aristocrats. Their wealth was\r\nderived chiefly from coal mines, and grew up in later days; the property\r\nat first, and for a long time, was of inconsiderable value. For more than\r\na century, however, the Lambtons had come to take rank among the gentry of\r\nthe country, and some member of the family had represented the city of\r\nDurham in the House of Commons from 1727 until the early death of Lord\r\nDurham's father, in December, 1797, William Henry Lambton, Lord Durham's\r\nfather, was a staunch Whig, and had been a friend and associate of Fox.\r\nJohn George Lambton, the son, was born at Lambton Castle, in April, 1792.\r\nBefore he was quite twenty years of age, he made a romantic marriage at\r\nGretna Green with a lady who died three years after. He served for a short\r\ntime in a regiment of Hussars. About a year after the death of his first\r\nwife, he married the eldest daughter of Lord Grey. In 1828 he was raised\r\nto the Peerage with the title of Baron Durham.\"--_History of Our Own\r\nTimes_, page 9.--Justin McCarthy.\r\n\r\n[85] I use the term advisedly, for had he followed out the Colborne policy\r\nand gibbetted the \"Bermuda exiles,\" he would have had one sin less to\r\natone for, at the hands of Lord Brougham and other merciless enemies in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n[86] Thanks to the late Mr. J.

Cushing\r\nAylwin. The Hale family were already in Canada, and became intimate with\r\nthe Allsops. George Allsop had six sons, all born in the Montcalm House\r\nramparts. At the time of Robert Allsop's birth his mother was placed for\r\nsafety in the vaults of the Citadel, at the time of the siege (1775) says\r\na family tradition. These six sons were as follows:--\r\n\r\n  George Waters Allsop, eldest, sent home to the Bluecoat School to be\r\n    educated; he was a Latin and Greek scholar, and a person of eminence\r\n    in other respects.\r\n  John Allsop, merchant in London.\r\n  Carleton Allsop, Consul-General to Colombia.\r\n  Robert Allsop, Deputy Commissary-General.\r\n  James Allsop, Paymaster 1st Batt., 44th Foot.\r\n  William Allsop, merchant, died at sea on a voyage to Buenos Ayres, and\r\n    was buried on the Patagonian coast, all co-seigneurs of Seignories of\r\n    Jacques Cartier and d'Auteuil.\r\n  James Allsop, at the age of 17, was taken by Hon. John Hale, Receiver-\r\n    General, into his office, St. John street, at $600 per annum. This\r\n    house was afterwards occupied by a Mrs. Stinson (I think as a\r\n    boarding-house); sold to Judge Aylwin, who left it by will to his\r\n    nephew, Robt S.

There were difficulties at first, he not being\r\n    considered old enough; but at last he was gazetted to one in the 1st\r\n    Batt., 44th Regt., and this Battalion was ordered to New Orleans, Hon.\r\n    Col. Mullins (Lord Ventry's son), commanding, who, being seized with a\r\n    panic on the field, disgraced himself, lost his presence of mind on\r\n    seeing the destruction the Americans were dealing out to the British\r\n    troops, by firing behind their cotton bags, and was in consequence the\r\n    cause of the death of Hon. Col. Pakenham, brother-in-law to the Duke\r\n    of Wellington. Miss Pakenham was a celebrated beauty, and engaged to\r\n    marry the Duke on his return from the Peninsular War; but having,\r\n    unfortunately, taken the small-pox during the Duke's absence, her\r\n    father wrote to the Duke to absolve him from his promise, she having\r\n    become so much disfigured from its effects, but the Duke was too\r\n    honourable, and married her. They were both in Brussels. My father,\r\n    who was Paymaster to the 2nd Battalion of the 44th, was at Waterloo.\r\n    We remained in Brussels some years.--(_Diary of Mrs. Chas. Aylwin_.)\r\n\r\n[102] See Appendix--\"La Négresse Rose.\"\r\n\r\n[103] Quebecers will remember with pleasure the presence in our midst of\r\nthis famous Polar navigator in August, 1880, and his lady, whose\r\nkindliness of manner and elegant French, won the hearts of many. The\r\ninstructive torpedo lectures of the scientific commander of the\r\n_Northampton_ iron-clad, Capt. Fisher, will likewise retain a corner\r\nin the chambers of memory.\r\n\r\n[104] In fact, the spot where the remains of the great geographer and\r\ndiscoverer are supposed to rest, seems to be the site on which the new\r\nPost Office in the Upper Town has lately been built. Another theory,\r\nhowever, is lately propounded by an Ottawa antiquary.

Having visited Switzerland\r\nand Holland, he came to Paris in 1830. Being well versed in German\r\nliterature, he edited for ten years the _Revue Germanique_, during\r\nwhich period he travelled and wrote much. In 1836-38 he went as the\r\nSecretary of a scientific expedition to the north of Europe. He spent\r\nseveral weeks at Archangel, visited Iceland, Greenland, and other\r\nhyperborean regions, and after his return published many works, among\r\nwhich may be mentioned Travels in Iceland and Greenland (7 vols., 8vo,\r\nwith elaborate maps and numerous folio plates), the Literature of Denmark\r\nand Sweden, Souvenirs of Voyages and Traditions, Popular Songs of the\r\nNorth, Letters on Holland and on Russia, Finland and Poland, Poems of a\r\nTraveller, the Rhine and the Nile, Letters upon Algeria and the Adriatic,\r\nA Summer on the Baltic, &c, &c, besides voluminous essays in reviews and\r\nmagazines. He was recalled from travels to become librarian of the\r\nDepartment of the Marine, and in 1847 was appointed in charge of the\r\nlibrary of Sainte Geneviève. He is still (in 1881) living in Paris.\r\n\r\n[106] _Lettres sur l'Amérique, par X Marmier, Canada, États-Unis, Havane,\r\nRio de la Plata_, 2 _Vols., Paris_, 1851.\r\n\r\n[107] The Jesuit Fathers were in the habit of fastening the painters of\r\ntheir canoes at the foot of the hill, \"la _canoterie_,\" on their return\r\nby water from their farm called \"_Ferme des Anges_,\" hence its name.\r\n\r\nWe borrow from the \"Directory for the City and Suburbs of Quebec\" for\r\n1791, by Hugh McKay, printed at the office of the _Quebec Herald_,\r\nthe following paragraph, \"_Rues Ecartées_\" (out-of-the-way streets)--\r\n\"_La Canoterie_ (canoe landings) follows the street Sault-au-Matelot,\r\ncommencing at the house of Cadet (where Mr. O. Aylwin resides), and\r\ncontinues up to Mr. Grant's distillery; St. Charles street commences there\r\nand terminates below Palace Gate; St. Nicholas street extends from Palace\r\nGate to the water's edge, passing in front of the residence of the widow\r\nLa Vallée; the old ship yard opposite to the boat yard, Cape Diamond\r\nstreet commences at the wharf owned by Mr. Antrobus and terminates at the\r\nouter extremity of that of Mons. Dunière, underneath Cape Diamond, the\r\nstreets Carrière, Mont Carmel, Ste. Geneviève, St. Denis, Des Grisons, are\r\nall situated above St. Louis street\" (Mr. Louis Dunière was M.P. in 1828.)\r\n\r\n[108] Mr. T. P. Bédard sends us the following note on this street:--\"Au\r\n17ème siècle, la rue Sault-au-Matelot était la rue commerciale par\r\nexcellence avec la rue Notre-Dame, c'était là où ce faisait toutes les\r\naffaires, la rue St. Pierre actuelle étant alors envahie par l'eau durant\r\nles grandes marées.\"\r\n\r\n[109] Did the dog belong to Champlain? an antiquary asks us.\r\n\r\n\"Ad laevum fluit amnis S. Laurentii, ad dextram S. Caroli fluviolus. Ad\r\nconfluentem, Promontorium assurgit, _Saltum Nautae_ vulgo vocant, ab\r\ncane hujus nominis qui se alias ex eo loco praecipitem dedit.\" (Historia\r\nCanadensis.--Creuxius, p. 204.)\r\n\r\n[110] François de Bienville.\r\n\r\n[111] In that early, dark, but not unhappy era of Quebec municipal\r\nexistence, in June, 1842, when the great novelist, Chas. Dickens,\r\nperambulated our thoroughfares and surveyed our battle fields, did the\r\nauthor of \"Pickwick,\" in his rambles, meet in this odoriferous lane any of\r\nthose \"roving, gentlemanly, philosophic, republican\" porkers, such as had\r\ncrossed his path in the \"empire city\" of the West, and which, as typical\r\nNew York pigs, have since become famous. \"A select party,\" says he, \"of\r\nhalf a dozen gentlemanly hogs have just now turned the corner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is a solitary swine lounging homeward by himself. He has only one\r\near, having parted with the other to vagrant dogs in the course of his\r\ncity rambles. But he gets on very well without it, and leads a roving,\r\ngentlemanly, vagabond life, somewhat answering to that of our club men at\r\nhome. He leaves his lodgings every morning at a certain hour, throws\r\nhimself upon the town, gets through the day in some manner quite\r\nsatisfactory to himself, and regularly appears at the door of his own\r\nhouse again at night, like the mysterious master of Gil Blas. He is a free\r\nand easy, careless, indifferent kind of pig, having a very large\r\nacquaintance among other pigs of the same character, whom he rather knows\r\nby sight than conversation, as he seldom troubles himself to stop and\r\nexchange civilities, but goes grunting down the kennel, turning up the\r\nnews and small talk of the city, in the shape of cabbage-stalks and offal,\r\nand bearing no tails but his own, which is a very short one, for his old\r\nenemies the dogs have been at that too, and have left him hardly enough to\r\nswear by. He is in every respect a Republican pig, going wherever he\r\npleases, and mingling with the best society, on an equal if not superior\r\nfooting, for every one makes way when he appears, and the haughtiest give\r\nhim the wall if he prefer it. He is a great philosopher, and seldom moved,\r\nunless by the dogs before mentioned.\"--(_Dickens' American Notes_, p. 38.)\r\n\r\n[112] CANADA'S ROYAL VISITORS--WHO HAVE BEEN HERE SINCE 1787.--\"Canada has\r\nbeen honoured with visits from the following Royal personages:--His Royal\r\nHighness Prince William Henry (afterwards William IV.) uncle of Her\r\nMajesty Queen Victoria, landed in Quebec in 1787. H.R.H. Prince Edward,\r\nDuke of Kent, father of Queen Victoria, visited Canada in 1791, four years\r\nlater than his brother. H.R.H. Albert Edward, Prince of Wales and heir\r\napparent of the British Crown, was in this country in 1860, and laid the\r\ncorner-stone of the Parliament Buildings at Ottawa. H.R.H. Prince Alfred,\r\nDuke of Edinburgh, second son of Queen Victoria, was here in 1861, H.R.H.\r\nPrince Leopold in May, 1880. H.E.H. Prince de Joinville, son of Louis\r\nPhilippe, King of France, was in Canada the same year as Prince Alfred.\r\nPrince Napoleon Bonaparte, cousin of Napoleon III., Emperor of France,\r\nalso in 1861. H.R.H. Prince Arthur, third son of the Queen, in 1869.\r\nH.R.H. the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia, in 1871. H.R.H. Dom Pedro, Emperor\r\nof Brazil, in 1876 (Centennial year); and Her Royal Highness the Princess\r\nLouise and H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh (his second visit), in 1878. It\r\nwill thus be seen that Queen Victoria's father, uncle and five of her\r\nchildren have been in Canada.\"\r\n\r\n[113] Opened by him in 1831.\r\n\r\n[114] \"Travels through North America during the years 1825-26,\" By Carl\r\nBernhard, Duke of Saxe-Weimar Eisenach.\r\n\r\n[115] Prescott Gate levelled in 1871.\r\n\r\n[116] These steps went into Prescott Gate.\r\n\r\n[117] The R.

He refused to acknowledge the\r\ncompetency of the tribunal to try him, appeared before it with his hat on,\r\n&c. Frontenac had him committed for contempt. Altogether it was a curious\r\nsquabble, the decision of which was ultimately left to the French King.--\r\n(Parkman's Frontenac, p. 37, M. Faillon, _La Colonie Française, Vol.\r\nIII, pp. 515, 517.)\r\n\r\n[120] Montcalm, de Vaudreuil, de Longueuil, de Bougainville, LaCorne, de\r\nBeaujeu, Taché, de Léry, de St. Ours and others constituted this party of\r\nhonourable men.\r\n\r\n[121] MÉMOIRES sur les affaires du Canada, 1749-60.\r\n\r\n[122] Servants, lackeys and nobodies were named store-keepers, \"_leur\r\nignorance et leur bassesse ne font point un obstacle_,\" say the\r\n_Mémoires_, 1749-60.\r\n\r\n[123] \"He (deCallières), says Parkman, laid before the King a plan, which\r\nhad, at least, the recommendation of boldness and cheapness. This was to\r\nconquer New York with the forces already in Canada, aided only by two\r\nships of war. The blow, he argued, should be struck at once, and the\r\nEnglish taken by surprise. A thousand regulars and six hundred Canadian\r\nMilitia should pass Lake Champlain and Lake George, in canoes and bateaux,\r\ncross to the Hudson, and capture Albany, where they would seize all the\r\nriver-craft, and descend the Hudson to the town of New York, which, as\r\nCallières states, had then about two hundred houses and four hundred\r\nfighting men. The two ships were to cruise at the mouth of the Harbour,\r\nand wait the arrival of the troops, which was to be made known to them by\r\nconcerted signals, whereupon they were to enter and aid in the attack. The\r\nwhole expedition, he thought, might be accomplished in a month, so that by\r\nthe end of October, the King would be master of the country....\r\n\r\nIt will be well to observe what were the instructions of the King towards\r\nthe colony which he proposed to conquer. They were as follows: If any\r\nCatholics were found in New York, they might be left undisturbed, provided\r\nthat they took an oath of allegiance to the King. Officers, and other\r\npersons who had the means of paying ransoms, were to be thrown into\r\nprison. All lands in the colony, except those of Catholics swearing\r\nallegiance, were to be taken from the owners, and granted under feudal\r\ntenure to the French officers and soldiers. All property, public or\r\nprivate, was to be seized, a portion of it given to the grantees of the\r\nland, and the rest sold on account of the King. Mechanics and other\r\nworkmen might, at the discretion of the commanding officer) be kept as\r\nprisoners to work at fortifications and do other labor. The rest of the\r\nEnglish and Dutch inhabitants, men, women, and children were to be carried\r\nout of the colony, and dispersed in New England, Pennsylvania or other\r\nplaces, in such manner, that they could not combine in any attempt to\r\nrecover their property and their country. And that the conquest might be\r\nperfectly secure, the nearest settlements of New England were to be\r\ndestroyed, and those more remote, laid under contribution.--(_Count\r\nFrontenac and New France under Louis XIV_, _p._ 187-9.)\r\n\r\n[124] See Appendix, _verbo_ \"CONQUEST IN NEW YORK.\"\r\n\r\n[125] THE CHIEN D'OR A LEGEND OF QUEBEC.\r\n\r\n[126] L'INTENDANT BIGOT.\r\n\r\n[127] For the names of the victims and further particulars, vide 2nd\r\nVolume du Dictionnaire Généalogique, par l'Abbé Tanguay.\r\n\r\n[128] These bricks were found to be only 1-1/2 inches thick, of a dark\r\nflinty appearance and as hard as iron, and seemed to be composed of silica\r\nand oxide of iron.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuit College had been occupied as a barrack, under the warrant of\r\nGeneral J.

He died here in 1840, immensely wealthy,\r\nthe cause of his death being a cold be caught in attending Parliament, at\r\nKingston, to remonstrate against what he considered the encroachments of\r\nthe City Council, at Quebec, who, to remove obstructions in the public\r\nstreets, had forcibly done away with the projecting steps of \"Freemasons'\r\nHall,\" the _Chien d'Or_ building, for years the property of George Pozer.\r\nGeorge Pozer was the grandfather of Hon.

William Grant had wedded, at Montreal, on the 11th September,\r\n1770, the widow of the third Baron de Longueuil, who had expired in 1755.\r\nHon Wm. Grant's decease is thus mentioned in the _Quebec Mercury_, on\r\nthe 7th October, 1805:--\"Died, on Saturday, of an inflammation in his\r\nbowels, after a short illness, William Grant, Esq., of St. Roch. He came\r\nto this country shortly after the conquest; (about 1763). Under the old\r\nconstitution (prior to 1774) he was many years a Privy and Legislative\r\nCouncillor. Under the present one, he was three times elected a\r\nrepresentative to the House of Assembly for the Upper Town of Quebec. He\r\nalso, at different periods, filled several other important stations in the\r\nProvince, in all which he manifested ability, assiduity and activity. He\r\nembarked in speculative enterprise at an early age, whence his life may be\r\ntruly said to have been a life of distinguished usefulness. His\r\npossessions are extensive and valuable\". On a portion of the lot acquired\r\nand still occupied by Mr. Prudent Vallée, from the heirs of the late Peter\r\nBrébaut, on the 4th May, 1833, by deed, before L. T. McPherson, Esq., N.\r\nP., there remains still the massive ruins of what in the early part of the\r\ncentury was a stately stone dwelling, with vaulted rooms in the basement.\r\nThe edifice faced towards St. Vallier street, and was surrounded by a high\r\nwall, with an iron gate on the St. Vallier street side, and an iron\r\n_porte-cochère_, enclosing what was once no doubt a blooming garden;\r\nit is now densely built over, since the great fire of 1845 swept over the\r\nlocality like a tornado. This ostentations mansion is described in Mr.\r\nVallée's deed as the \"Manor House,\" and we are led to believe that here\r\nfor many a long day flourished the enterprising and wealthy \"Seignior of\r\nSt. Roch,\" the Hon. Wm. Grant, Receiver-General of His Majesty's rents,\r\nwith Madame La Baronne de Longueuil, his respected spouse. The Grant\r\nestate, by a patent from Sir James Craig, dated 11th March, 1811,\r\nsubsequently included what is now a most populous portion of St. Roch,\r\nstyled \"La Vacherie,\" because the city cows were daily brought to these\r\nmoist lands adjoining the St. Charles. However, this opulent family had\r\nanother manor, built by the Baronne very shortly after her marriage with\r\nMr. Grant, in 1770, on the lovely Island of St. Hélène, opposite to\r\nMontreal. She had also erected, opposite to Molson's brewery, a\r\n_banal_ mill to grind the corn garnered in the neighborhood. The St.\r\nHélène manor was probably the country seat during the summer mouths, and\r\nthe St. Vallier street mansion _la maison de ville_ of its busy and\r\nsuccessful master, who died in 1805, ten years after his noble lady, who\r\nhad expired on the 25th February, 1795.\r\n\r\n[140] This gentleman (Mr. William Henderson) was for many years Secretary\r\nof the Quebec Fire Assurance Company.

Let\r\nus quote his biographer's own words: \"Son entrée dans Rome fut superbe; il\r\nétait dans un carosse ouvert, en forme de calèche, tout brillant d'or,\r\nmême jusqu'aux roues qui étaient dorées. Ses chevaux étaient ferres avec\r\ndes plaques d'argent qui ne tenaient que par un seul clou, afin que,\r\nvenant à se détacher, elles fussent ramassées par les pauvres, à qui,\r\noutre cela, il faisait jeter quantité d'argent.

Originally a\r\nColonel in the King's Guards, he came to Canada in 1665, a Captain in the\r\nCarignan Regiment. He was, in 1680-1, in command of Fort Penobscot in\r\nMaine. He married Matilda, the daughter of Madockawando, Sachem of the\r\nPenobscots, by which tribe he was adopted and elevated to the rank of\r\nChief. He played a conspicuous part in the wars of that day, signed\r\ntreaties with the Governors of New England. Having amassed a property of\r\n300,000 crowns, he retired eventually to France, where he had an estate.\r\nHe was succeeded by his son in the Government of Penobscot. His daughters\r\nmarried advantageously in the colony.

Our youthful grandmothers of 1791 would have no other than\r\nMonsieur Laforme to dress their hair for the _Château_ balls. A memorable\r\ninstance has been handed down to posterity of the awful dilemma in which,\r\neither a press of engagements or an oversight, placed the Court\r\n_peruquier_, from which his genius alone extricated him. The\r\nbeautiful Mrs. P----t, the consort of the Speaker of the Legislative\r\nAssembly in 179-, had to attend at a ball at the Castle St. Louis.\r\nUnfortunately she had omitted engaging in time Laforme to arrange her hair\r\nfor the evening in question; and every hour of the day on which the ball\r\nwas to take place, being bespoken, the hair-dresser at his wit's ends said\r\nthat he would guarantee that she would yet go to the ball, but she must\r\nplace herself entirely in his hands. \"Well,\" said the _Grande Dame_,\r\n\"what, then, am I to do?\" \"Bah!\" said the _peruquier_, \"'tis easily\r\nsettled; I shall _do_ your hair the day _previous_.\"--\"But then how am I\r\nto sleep with my hair done up?\" \"Oh! that is again easily arranged--you\r\nwill sleep in _fauteuil_. I will have your hair and head padded and\r\nstrapped down.\" And thus was it done and she went to the ball.\r\n\r\n[218] The Hon.

This scenery is altogether magnificent, and\r\nparticularly towards the east, where the great precipices overhang Wolfe's\r\nCove.

The following are the names\r\nof a few of the plants grown in the stove-house:--_Ardisia; Alamanda;\r\nAmaryllis, Achimenes; Aschynanthus, Asclepias, Begonias, Crinums,\r\nCentradinias; Calumnmas, Drymonias; Euphorbias, Franciscia; Goidfussia;\r\nGesneras_, in twelve varieties; _Gloxinias_, in twenty-four varieties;\r\n_Gloriosa; Gardenias; Hibiscus; Inga; Ipomaea; Justicia; Lamandra;\r\nLegastrema; Musa-Cavendishii_, which we fruited--the only one fruited in\r\nthe province to this day, to my knowledge--the bunch of fruit weighed\r\nninety pounds; _Maranta; Melastomas, Mennetties; Nymphas; Osbeekias,\r\nPenteas, Passiflora; Peideum; Stephenotis, Streluzias; Russellea; Ruellea;\r\nRondilitia, Tabernaemonana; Tradescantia; Vinca; Clerodendrons,_ &c., &c.\r\nIn the orchid house, the following are a portion of the names of plants\r\ngrown be me:--_Bletia; Bolbophyllum; Cyppripedium; Cymbedium; Catazetum;\r\nCattleya; Brassavoleas, Dendrobiums, Epidendrons, Aerides; Gongora;\r\nGomezia; Maxallaria; Oncidium, Plurathalis; Pholidota; Physosiphon;\r\nPlurathalles; Peristerias, Ripsalis, Stanhopeas; Zygopetalum_, &c., &c.\r\nThe houses containing the above were heated by hot-water pipes for\r\natmospheric heat and open tanks for bottom heat; they were the most\r\ncomplete of the kind I have seen either in Canada or Great Britain--so\r\nmuch so, that, during my stay with Mr. Atkinson, we used to produce for\r\nChristmas and New Year's Day pine-apples, cucumbers, rhubarb, asparagus\r\nand mushrooms, all in the same house.\"\r\n\r\n[231] Mr. DeGaspé married, 1811, Susanna, daughter of Thos. Allison, Esq.,\r\na captain of the 6th Regiment, infantry, and of Theresse Baby, the\r\nlatter's two brother officers, Captains Ross Lewin and Bellingham,\r\nafterwards Lord Bellingham, married at Detroit then forming part of Upper\r\nCanada, two sisters, daughters of the Hon. Jacques Duperon Baby.\r\n\r\n[232] The copy of Audubon's works here alluded to, was the same, we opine,\r\nas that generously presented by the illustrious _savant_ to Mr. Martyn,\r\nchronometer-maker, St Peter street,--an ardent ornithologist, whose roof\r\nsheltered the great naturalist, in Quebec in 1842.\r\n\r\nAudubon made several excursions round Quebec to study our birds, was the\r\nhonoured guest of the late Henry Atkinson, at Spencer Wood, and visited\r\nthe collection of Canadian birds of Hon. William Sheppard, at Woodfield.\r\n\r\n[233] His last work in the cause of natural history is the publication of\r\nhis \"_Tableau Synoptique des Oiseaux du Canada_,\" got the use of schools,\r\nwhich must have entailed no small amount of labour, a sequel to \"_Les\r\nOiseaux du Canada_,\" 2 vols., 1860.\r\n\r\n[234] These stones and inscriptions were donated to the author of \"_Quebec\r\nPast and Present_\"--by the city authorities on taking down the City Gates.\r\n\r\n[235] Pierre Herman Dosquet, born at Lille in Flanders in 1691, arrived in\r\nCanada in 1721, was shortly afterwards sent a missionary to the Lake of\r\nTwo Mountains, was made a bishop in 1725, purchased Samos from Nicholas de\r\nla Nouiller, in 1731, where he built a country house in 1732. Sold it some\r\nyears afterwards to the Quebec Seminary, visited France in 1733 and\r\nresigned his see and left the country in 1739 and died in Paris in 1777.\r\n\r\n[236] Judge Adam Mabane died in 1792.\r\n\r\n[237] A fairy plot of a flower garden was laid out near the edge of the\r\ncliff to the north-east, with a Chinese Pagoda enclosing the trunk of a\r\nlarge tree at one side, and a tiny Grecian temple at the other.\r\n\r\n[238] Probably the four-gun battery mentioned in the account of the Battle\r\nof the Plains. We also find in a diary of the siege operations on the same\r\nday, \"A mortar and some l8-pounders were carried to Samos, three quarters\r\nof a league from the town. Batteries were erected there, which fired\r\nbefore night on the man-of-war that had come to anchor opposite, _L'Ance\r\ndu Foulon_, which was forced to sheer off.\"\r\n\r\n[239] \"Who can visit the sylvan abode, sacred to the repose of the\r\ndeparted without noticing one tomb in particular in the enclosure of Wm.\r\nPrice, Esq. we allude to that of Sir Edmund Head's gifted son? The\r\ntroubled waters of the St. Maurice and the quiet grave at Sillery recall\r\nas in a vision, not only the generous open-hearted boy, who perished in\r\none and sleeps in the other, but they tell us also of the direct line of a\r\ngood old family cut off--a good name passing away, or if preserved at all,\r\npreserved only on a tombstone.\"--_Notman's British Americans_.\r\n\r\n[240] The late Bishop is the author of a collection of poems known as the\r\n_Songs of the Wilderness_, many of the subjects therein having been\r\nfurnished in the course of his apostolic labours in the Red River\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n[241] The following is the extract from the _True Witness_ referred\r\nto: \"In the reign of George II, the see of York falling vacant, His\r\nMajesty being at a loss for a fit person to appoint to the exalted\r\nsituation, asked the opinion of the Rev. Dr. Mountain, who had raised\r\nhimself by his remarkable facetious temper to the See of Durham. The Dr.\r\nwittily replied. 'Hadst thou faith, thou wouldst say to this mountain (at\r\nthe same time laying his hand on his breast) be removed and cast into the\r\nsea (see).' His Majesty laughed heartily, and forthwith conferred the\r\npreferment on the facetious doctor.\"\r\n\r\n[242] \"En 1865, les Iroquois furieux d'avoir vu manquer l'effet de leurs\r\npropositions faites aux Hurons, firent des incursions dans la colonie et\r\njusqu'au bas de Québec. Au mois de mai, on plantait le blé d'Inde dans les\r\nenvirons de Québec; un frère Jésuite avait voulu engager les Algonquins à\r\nfaire la garde chacun leur tour et pour leur donner l'exemple, le bon\r\nFrère avait voulu être la première sentinelle. Il s'était donc avancé en\r\nexplorant dans les bois (c'était dans le voisinage de la propriété\r\nactuelle de M. le Juge Caron, sur le Chemin du Cap Rouge), tout â coup le\r\nFrère reçut deux coups de feu qui l'étendirent à terre grièvement blessé,\r\net en même temps deux Iroquois, sortant d'un taillis, l'assommèrent et lui\r\nenlevèrent la chevelure.

He was appointed, soon\r\nafter, Clerk of the Provincial Parliament, and subsequently Master in\r\nChancery of the Province of Lower Canada, and, in 1814, was appointed by\r\nEarl Bathurst a member of the Executive Council. He was the author of the\r\nfirst English \"History of Canada, from its first discovery to the year\r\n1791,\" a standard work in two volumes. He died at Quebec, 17th December,\r\n1847.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smith married Susan, who died at Quebec, 26th Jan, 1819, daughter\r\nof Admiral Charles Webber, of the County of Hampshire, England, by whom he\r\nleft five children:\r\n\r\n  1.

He was born at New York, 18th June, 1728. In\r\nhis youth, he was sent to a grammar school, and afterwards to Yale\r\nCollege, Connecticut, where he greatly distinguished himself by his\r\nlearning. He was an excellent Greek and Hebrew scholar, and a thorough\r\nmathematician. He was appointed Chief Justice of New York, 24th April,\r\n1780. At the breaking out of the rebellion in 1775, he was a staunch\r\nLoyalist, and left New York in the same vessel with the King's troops and\r\nSir Guy Carleton, and landed at Plymouth, 16th January, 1784. As A reward\r\nfor his loyalty, he was made Chief Justice of Lower Canada, 1st September,\r\n1785, and came to Canada in the Frigate \"Thistle\" of 28 guns, with Lord\r\nDorchester, the Governor-General of Canada, landing at Quebec, 23rd\r\nOctober, 1786. Chief Justice Smith was the author of the \"History of the\r\nProvince of New York, from the first settlement to the year 1732.\" He\r\nmarried, 3d November, 1752, Janet, daughter of James Livingstone, Esq., of\r\nNew York, and died at Quebec, 6th December, 1793. His Royal Highness,\r\nPrince Edward, fourth son of King George III, with a numerous train of\r\nfriends, followed the remains to the grave from his late dwelling on St.\r\nLouis street. He owned the land on which his son-in-law, Chief Justice\r\nSewell, subsequently built his mansion, down, he the lot (inclusive) on\r\nwhich stood his dwelling, and where his son the Hon. William Smith, died\r\nin 1847. It is now the property of sheriff Chs.

In the fall of 1775--being then 17 years\r\nof age, he joined a regiment of men raised in Lancaster Co. for the\r\npurpose of joining Arnold, who at that time was stationed in Boston. His\r\nbook is addressed to \"my dear children\" and assures them \"upon the honour\r\nof a gentleman and an honest man, that every word here related, to the\r\nbest of his recollection and belief is literally true.\" He with an officer\r\nand seven men were dispatched in advance of the army \"for the purpose of\r\nascertaining and marking the paths which were used by the Indians at the\r\nnumerous places in the wilderness towards the head of the river Kennebec,\r\nand also to ascertain the course of the river Chaudière.\" Each day's\r\nproceedings are carefully noted, and are really highly interesting,\r\nshowing the great privations they had to endure.\r\n\r\n[254] The remains of this old French chapel were recently discovered, (the\r\nsite belongs to R. R. Dobell & Co.) and a small monument erected to Father\r\nMassé who was interred there in 1646.\r\n\r\n[255] \"7th September, 1759.--Fine warm weather, Admiral Holmes' squadron\r\nweighed early this morning. At six o'clock we doubled the mouth of the\r\nChaudière, which is near half a mile over; and at eight we came to anchor\r\noff Cap Rouge. Here is a spacious cove, into which the river St. Michael\r\ndisembogues, and within the mouth of it are the enemy's floating\r\nbatteries. A large body of the enemy is well entrenched round the cove,\r\n(which is of circular form) as if jealous of a descent in those parts;\r\nthey appear very numerous, and may amount to about one thousand six\r\nhundred men, besides their cavalry, who are cloathed in blue, and mounted\r\non neat horses of different colours; they seem very alert, parading and\r\ncounter marching between the woods on the heights in their rear, and their\r\nbreastworks, in order to make their number show to the greater advantage.\r\nThe lands all around us are high and commanding, which gave the enemy an\r\nopportunity of popping at our ships, this morning, as we tacked in working\r\nup.\"--_Knox's Journal, Siege of Quebec_, 1759, vol. ii., page 56.\r\n\r\n[256] _AN EARL ON FOX-HUNTING._\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Winchelsea and Nottingham addressed the following letter to\r\nthe _Pall Mall Gazette_, in May 1870:--Sir,--The fox is tolerated,\r\nnay preserved (under the penalty of conventional ostracism against his\r\nslayers,) because he is the only animal with whose intellect man may\r\nmeasure himself upon equal terms without an overwhelming sense of the odds\r\nin his favour. The lion, the elephant, the ibex, the chamois, and the red\r\ndeer are beasts of chase falling before man, but the fox alone can cope\r\nwith him in point of intellect and sagacity, and put him to all his\r\nshifts. It is this ingredient in fox-hunting--viz: the consciousness of\r\nhaving to do with a foe worthy of him, which brings men of all ages,\r\nsorts, kinds, intellects, characters, and professions to the covert side,\r\nuniting together occasionally as odd an assemblage as ever went into the\r\nark. No man, when he puts on his top-boots in the morning, can say whether\r\nhe may not be about to assist at a run which may live in story like the\r\nBillesdon Coplow or the Trojan War, and of which it shall be sufficient,\r\nnot only to the fortunate sportsman himself but to his descendants of the\r\nthird and fourth generation, to say--he was there!\r\n\r\n  Villiers, Cholmondeley, and Forester made such sharp play,\r\n  Not omitting Germaine, never seen till to-day:\r\n  Had you jug'd of these four by the trim of their pace\r\n  At Bib'ry you'd thought they had been riding a race.\r\n                           _Billesdon Coplow_.\r\n\r\n\"Their fame lives still. But what, O ye sentimentalists! would ye prepare\r\nboth for fox and fox-hunter? If the fox was not regarded as the only\r\nanimal possessed of these talents and capabilities, he must shortly rank\r\nas a sneaking little robber of hen-roosts, the foe of the good wife and\r\ngamekeeper, and become as extinct as a dodo. Were the fox himself\r\nconsulted, I am sure that he would prefer to this ignoble fate the present\r\npleasant life which he is in the habit of leading upon the sole condition\r\nof putting forth all his talent and dying game when wanted.\"\r\n\r\n[257] I am indebted for a deal of information contained in this\r\ncommunication to McPherson LeMoyne, Esq., Seigneur of Crane Island, P.Q.,\r\nand lately President of the Montreal Club for the _protection of fish\r\nand game_.\r\n\r\n[258] Chs. Panet, Esq., ex-member for the County of Quebec.\r\n\r\n[259] The sanguinary battle of Fontenoy was fought on the 11th May, 1745.\r\nThe Duke of Cumberland, subsequently surnamed \"the butcher,\" for his\r\nbrutality at Culloden, commanding the English, &c, the French led by\r\nMaréchal de Saxe. This defeat, which took place under the eye of Louis XV\r\ncost the British 4041, their allies the Hanoverians, 2762 and the Dutch\r\n1541 men. Success continued to attend the French arms at Ghent, Bruges,\r\nOudenarde, and Dendermond, which were captured--(_Lord Mahon_) Wolfe,\r\nMurray and Townshend were at Fontenoy. The battle of Lauffeld took place\r\non the 2nd July, 1747, the English commanded by Cumberland, the French by\r\nSaxe, the chief of the English Cavalry, Sir John Ligonier, being taken\r\nprisoner--(_Lord Mahon_). The French victory of Carillon, in which\r\nthe Militia of Canada bore a conspicuous part, was won near Lake George,\r\n8th July, 1758. The English army, under General Abercrombie, though more\r\nnumerous, was repulsed with great slaughter.\r\n\r\n[260] Chs. Tarieu de Lanaudière, Knight of St. Louis, commanded a portion\r\nof the Canadian Militia at Carillon, and also during the campaign of 1759.\r\nUnder the English rule he was Aide de Camp to Sir Guy Carleton--served in\r\n1775, and accompanied the General to England, where George III rewarded\r\nhim handsomely.

(Her name was Neville).\r\n\r\n[269] The old Château Garden.--This lot, 3 acres, 3 yards, 9-1/2 feet in\r\nsuperficies, was granted to Major Samuel Holland by letters-patent, under\r\nthe great seal, on the 12th March, 1766, with certain reservations as to\r\nthe requirements for barracks or fortifications. The Major does not seem\r\nto have taken possession of it--but about 1780, General Haldimand having\r\ntendered Major Holland the sum of £800 as an indemnity for the use of the\r\nland, and the amount being refused, Government took possession of the lot\r\nand erected there a five-gun battery. Major Holland died in 1801, and by\r\nhis will, dated 25th Oct., 1800, bequeathed the property to his wife,\r\nMarie Josette Rolet, and his children, John Frederick, Charlotte, Susannah\r\nand George Holland, in equal shares.\r\n\r\n[270] The original Holland House stood a little behind the present\r\nmansion.\r\n\r\n[271] The last will and codicil of S.

Connolly, Esq., now exists.\r\n\r\n[273] This property has since passed by sherrif's sale into the hands of\r\nArch.

Seulement il pourrait bien se faire qu'on\r\npris trop à la lettre un mot de son édition de 1632, où il dit que les\r\nvaisseaux de Cartier hivernèrent là où était de son temps la demeure des\r\nJésuites. Quant à Charlevoix, non-seulement il n'a pas, éclairci la\r\nquestion, mais il n'a fait que l'embrouiller.

Hamel, in 1843, on the recent discovery of\r\nthe wreck of the _Petite Hermine_, on the _Ferme des Anges_, at the mouth\r\nof the Lairet stream, thus expressed himself, p. 3:--\"Il ne me fut pas\r\ndifficile, en suivant attentivement le texte du second voyage de Jacques\r\nCartier, tel que nous le donne Lescarbot, de prouver, jusqu'à l'évidence,\r\nque ce navigateur Malouin avait réellement passé l'hiver à la rivière St.\r\nCharles, et non à celle qui porte aujourd'hui le nom de Jacques Cartier;\r\net je crois que depuis ma dissertation, il n'est resté en ce pays aucun\r\ndoute sur ce sujet.\"\r\n\r\n[286] \"Le lundi, onzième jour d'octobre, nous arrivasmes au Hâble de\r\nSainte Croix, ou estaient nos navires, et trouvasmes que les maistres et\r\nmariniers qui estaient demeurés avaient fait un fort devant lesdits\r\nnavires, tout clos de grosses pièces de bois plantées debout, joignant les\r\nunes aux autres, et tout à l'entour garni d'artillerie, et bien en ordre\r\npour se défendre contre tout le pays.\"--(_Second voyage de Jacques\r\nCartier_, p. 48). Republished by Literary and Historical Society of\r\nQuebec, in 1843. At the foot, we read, \"On pense que ce fort a dû être\r\nbâti à l'endroit où la petite Rivière Lairet se décharge dans la Rivière\r\nSt. Charles.\" \"The exact spot in the River St. Charles, where Cartier\r\nmoored his vessel, is supposed on good authority to have been the site of\r\nthe old bridge (a little higher up than the present), called Dorchester\r\nBridge, where there is a ford at low water, close to the Marine Hospital.\r\nThat it was on the east bank, not far from the former residence of Chas.\r\nSmith, Esq., is evident from the river having been frequently crossed by\r\nthe natives coming from Stadacona, to visit their French guests.\"\r\n(_Hawkins' Picture of Quebec_, p. 47) The Abbé Faillon in his elaborate\r\nwork--_Histoire de la Colonie Française au Canada_, 1865--in some valuable\r\nnotes on Jacques Cartier, p. 496, discusses the erroneous views of\r\nCharlevoix and Father Leclerc, and corroborates the accepted belief about\r\nthe St. Charles and not the Jacques Cartier River, as being the spot where\r\nthe great discoverer wintered in 1535-36.\r\n\r\n[287] Would this river be the Lairet or the St. Charles? We like to give\r\nevery circumstance calculated to throw light thereon: writers seem to\r\nagree that Jacques Cartier, wintered in the St. Charles, as Champlain\r\nsays, in his edition of 1632, on the Jesuits' property--it may, however,\r\nhave been a few acres to the east or west of the spot generally indicated.\r\n\r\n[288] \"Le Capitaine fit renforcer le Fort tout à l'entour de gros fossés,\r\nlarges, et profonds avec porte à pont-levis et renforts de rangs ou pans\r\nde bois au contraire des premiers. Et fut ordonné pour le guet de la\r\nnuit.... cinquante hommes à quatre quarts, et à chacun changement des dits\r\nquarts les trompettes sonnantes; ce qui fut fait selon la dite\r\nordonnance.\"--_Voyage de Jacques Cartier_, page 52.\r\n\r\n[289] It is evident that the Beauport entrenchments were to be on a vast\r\nscale In those days of _corvées_ and forced labor, when it was merely\r\nnecessary to command _de par le roi_, it was easy to bring together\r\nlarge bodies of men. \"M. de Montcalm arrive à Québec (from Montréal),\r\ncommanda tout le monde pour travailler à des retrenchements qui furent\r\ntracés vers une paroisse nominée Beauport. Comme il pensait que ces\r\nouvrages ne seraient pas en état avant l'arrivée des vaisseaux anglais, ce\r\nqui pourrait être d'un jour à l'autre, il envoya un ordre à M. de Lévis,\r\nqui était à Montréal, de commander, générallement, tous les hommes de ce\r\ngouvernement à de descendre à Québec, et qu'on avait besoin d'un coup de\r\nmain. Il envoya à cet égard des ordres précis et conformes, dans tontes\r\nles paroisses, qui mirent tout le monde en mouvement.\" (_Memoirs sur les\r\naffaires du Canada_, 1749-1760.) Finally, Vaudreuil decided that\r\nMontreal would furnish 1,500 men only for this service.\r\n\r\n[290] This bake-house appears to have been somewhere at the foot of\r\nAbraham's Hill.\r\n\r\n[291] It crossed the St Charles a little higher than the Marine Hospital,\r\nexactly at the foot of Crown Street.\r\n\r\n[292] A small bridge supported on masonry has since been built on this\r\nspot, exactly across the main road, at Brown's mills, Beauport.\r\n\r\n[293] _The Great River_. Such was the name the Lorette Huron Indians\r\npressed Hon. Mr. Panet to take when they elected him their honorary chief.\r\n\r\n[294]  A famous _Chasseur_ of Lake St. Charles.\r\n\r\n[295] Robert Buchanan's fine lines describe well the sudden coming of\r\nwinter:\r\n\r\n           \"Then, with a gust,\r\n  Old Winter tumbled shrieking from the hills,\r\n  His white Hair flowing in the wind.\"\r\n\r\n[296] Emma Duchesnay, wife of Robt. LeMoine, Esq., Ottawa, was the last\r\nborn there.\r\n\r\n[297] Beauport Church, it is said, was built on this _Fief du Buisson_.\r\n\r\n[298] \"Une chandelle faite avec la graisse d'un pendu.\"\r\n\r\n[299] Le mot chirurgien--qui était la profession de Gifart, se présente\r\nnaturellement, mais l'article manque....Oh! le C, si c'était un R? plus de\r\ndoute l'affaire serait claire.\r\n\r\n[300] NOTE.--In a parliamentary Document of 1852, it is stated to have\r\nbeen conceded on 15th January, 1634.\r\n\r\n[301] By an ordinance of the Special Council, obtained through Sir Poulet\r\nThompson, in the troublous times of 1838-41, these gentlemen made safe\r\ntheir well-beloved charter.\r\n\r\n[302] Mr. Ryland, writing to Sir James Craig under date 22nd August, 1810,\r\nthus describes his interview with the Ministers of State, the Earl of\r\nLiverpool, Lord Bathurst, Mr. Percival, Mr. Peel, Lord Camden, the Marquis\r\nof Wellesey, &c \"On entering the room I found it was a meeting of the\r\nCabinet Ministers, eight in number, Lord Liverpool desired me to take a\r\nseat between him and Mr. Percival.... I then repeated an observation I had\r\nmade in my first interview with Lord Liverpool, concerning Bédard in\r\nparticular as the leader of the anti-government party, who has now so\r\ncommitted himself as to render it impossible he be employed....\r\n\r\n\"H. W. RYLAND.\"\r\n\r\n(Christie's History of Canada.)\r\n\r\n[303] MR. RYLAND TO SIR J. H. CRAIG, K.B.\r\n\r\nLondon, 14th August, 1810.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,--I yesterday had the honor to dine with the Earl of Liverpool\r\nat Coombe Wood; the party consisted of His Lordship, Lady Liverpool, Lord\r\nand Lady Bathurst, Lord Ashley and his sister, I believe, Sir Joseph and\r\nLady Banks, Mr. Peel the Under-Secretary of State, and a lady whose name I\r\ndo not recollect.\r\n\r\nI had some conversation with Mr. Peel, before dinner, concerning the state\r\nof things in Canada, and I was mortified to find that he had but an\r\nimperfect idea of the subject....\r\n\r\nHe told me that he had read Lord Granville's despatch of October, 1789, to\r\nLord Dorchester, which I had recommended to his attention, and he seemed\r\nto think a re-union of the Provinces a desirable object....\r\n\r\n  H. W. RYLAND.\"\r\n\r\n  (Christie's History of Canada.)\r\n\r\n[304] In 1871, Mr. John Henderson Galbraith expired at Mount Lilac,\r\nleaving to his widow his beautiful country-seat, on which he had expended\r\nsome $25,000. The foundry or machine shop was closed, and under the\r\nintelligent care of Miss Elizabeth Galbraith, Mount Lilac continues to\r\nproduce each summer ambrosial fruit and exquisite flowers.\r\n\r\n[305] Originally a brewery owned by Intendant Talon, and sold to the\r\nFrench King, in 1686 for 15,000 _écus_. Later on the Intendant's Palace,\r\nin magnificence rivalled the _Château St. Louis_.\r\n\r\n[306] _Kahir-Koubat_ \"a meandering stream\" Ahatsistari's house (formerly\r\n\"Poplar Grove,\" the homestead of L. T. McPherson, Esq.), on the north bank\r\nof the St. Charles, was called _Kahir-Koubat_ by N. Monpetit. Here\r\nformerly dwelt, we are told, Col. De Salaberry, the hero of Châteauguay,\r\nuntil 1814.\r\n\r\n[307] Beyond the unmistakable vestiges of its having been of early French\r\nconstruction, there is nothing known of the origin under French rule, of\r\nBigot's little _Château_. History is replete with details about his\r\npeculations and final punishment in the Bastile of France; possibly the\r\nlegends in prose and in verse, which mantle round the time-worn rein, have\r\nno other foundation than the fictions of the poet and the novelist. Thanks\r\nto Amédée Papineau, W. Kirby, Jos. Mannette, Beaumanoir, Bigot's Château,\r\nis now immortalized in song.\r\n\r\n[308] Ahatsistari, such the name of the former great Huron warrior, which\r\nMr. Montpetit was allowed to assume when recently elected Honorary Chief\r\nof the Council of Sachems, possibly for the service rendered to the tribe\r\nas their historiographer.\r\n\r\n[309] The French named the Wyandats, Hurons, from their style of wearing\r\ntheir hair--erect and thrown back, giving their head, says the Historian\r\nFerland, the appearance of a boar's head, \"_une hure de sanglier_.\"\r\n\r\n[310] The Dutch called them Maquas; the English, Mohawks, probably from\r\nthe name of the river Mohawk which flows into the Hudson.\r\n\r\n[311] The Mission of St. Joseph, composed of 400 Huron families, was\r\nsuddenly attacked by the Iroquois on the 4th July, 1648.\r\n\r\n[213] St. Ignace was surprised and taken on 16th March, 1649.\r\n\r\n[313] Ste. Marie mission-house was given to the flames by the Jesuits\r\nthemselves on 15th May, 1649.\r\n\r\n[314] St Jean was ravaged on 7th December, 1649.\r\n\r\n[315] This parish was called after the celebrated Church of _Santa Casa_,\r\nof Loretto, in Italy. The Huron Missionary, Father Chaumonot, had arranged\r\ntheir huts around the church, which he had erected in imitation of the\r\nLoretto Chapel in Italy, where he had seen a vision of angels.\r\n\r\n[316] A census of the settlement taken on 19th January, 1879, exhibits the\r\npopulation as composed of 326 souls, divided as follows:--Adult Males,\r\n94; Adult Females, 137; Boys, 49; Girls, 56. Total, 336. 143 males to 193\r\nfemales; bachelors must have been at a premium in the settlement. We\r\nunderstood that a complete history of the tribe is now in course of\r\npreparation by the Rev. Prosper Vincent, a son of Chief Vincent.\r\n\r\n[317] An excellent sketch in French has been published of _Tahourenche_\r\nand his tribe, in the Opinion Publique, under the _nom de plume_ of\r\n_Ahatsistari_, which we think ourselves warranted in crediting to the\r\nelegant pen of A. N. Montpetit, one of their honorary Chiefs.\r\n\r\n[318] Probably the same as alluded to in a quaint old engraving, presented\r\nus by John Neilson, Esq., P.L.S., a son of the Hon. John Neilson, himself\r\nan honorary Chief of the Lorette Hurons. Under the portrait of Chief\r\nNicholas is printed \"Nicholas Vincent Isawanhoni,\" principal Christian\r\nchief and Captain of the Huron Indians, established at _La Jeune Lorette_,\r\nnear Quebec, habited in the costume of his country, as when presented to\r\nhis Majesty George IV. on the 7th of April, 1826, with three other chiefs\r\nof his nation, by _Generals Brock and Carpenter_; the chief bears in his\r\nhand the wampum or collar, on which is marked the tomahawk given by his\r\nlate Majesty George III. The gold medal on his neck was the gift of his\r\nMajesty on this presentation.\r\n\r\n\"They were accompanied and introduced into England on the _14th December_,\r\n1824, by Mr. W. Cooper, who though an Englishman, they state to be a chief\r\nof their nation, and better known to them as chief _Tourhaunchi_.\"\r\n\r\nN.B.--It may be well to say that from the earliest times the Lorette\r\nIndians have been in the habit of electing as \"Honorary Chiefs\" Quebecers\r\nof note, who may have rendered service to the tribe. A large oil painting\r\nis now in the possession of William D. Campbell, Esq., of Quebec,\r\nexhibiting the installation as a Chief, in 1837, of the late Robert Symes,\r\nJ.P., of Quebec.\r\n\r\n[319] _Ononthio_ means the _Great Mountain_, the name the Indians gave\r\nGovernor de Montmagny and his successors.\r\n\r\n[320] The 8 is pronounced _oui_.\r\n\r\n[321] May, 1675, Louis XIV and Colbert granted Monsieur le Comte Talon,\r\nIntendant, the Seigniory des Islets, \"together with those three\r\nneighboring villages to us belonging the first called Bourg Royal, the\r\nsecond Bourg La Reine, the third, Bourg Talon, subsequently changed into\r\nthe Barony of Orsainville.\"--(_Ferland_, Vol. II p 59.)\r\n\r\n[322] I am happy to be able to throw some additional light on the early\r\ntimes of this mysterious ruin, which has much perplexed Quebec\r\nantiquaries. 'Tis probable this stately mansion was built by the great\r\nIntendant Talon as the baronial _château_, permitted by his grant,\r\n(see _Seignorial Documents_, 1852,--page 444 and 488) according to\r\nwhich he was empowered to establish gaols, \"a four-post gibbet, a post\r\nwith an iron collar on which his arms should be engraved.\" Of all this\r\nredoubtable feudal pomp there are no vestiges now extant. How the\r\n_château_ fared from Talon's time to Bigot's, remains a mystery.\r\n\r\nAfter the conquest, the land came by purchase into the possession of the\r\nStewart family, lately represented by Charles Grey Stewart--a most\r\ninteresting and lengthy letter from Charles Stewart, describing the winter\r\nmonths spent in the Hermitage in 1775-6, whilst Arnold held for Congress\r\nthe environs of Quebec, will be given hereafter, Mr. Wm. Crawford the late\r\nowner of the land and ruins, having kindly allowed me the use of his title\r\ndeeds. I find therein stated \"Charles Stewart, avocat et notaire demeurant\r\nà Québec, propriétaire du fief de Grand Pré, autrefois dit De la\r\nMistanguenne ou Mont Plaisir, à la Canardière par acte de vente du 26 Juin\r\n1780, devant Jean Antoine Panet, N.P., concède a titre de cens et rentes\r\nseigneuriales ... à Monsieur Jean Lees, le Jeune, Simon Fraser, le Jeune,\r\net William Wilson, négotiant en cette ville, 10 arpents de front situés\r\ndans le fief Grand Pré ou Mont Plaisir à la Canardière an lieu nommé la\r\nMontagne on l'Hermitage, prenant d'un bout, vers le sud aux terres de\r\nJoseph Bédard, et Jean Baptiste Le Roux dit Cardinal, et allant en\r\nprofondeur vers le nord quatorze arpents ou environ, jusqu'à la vieille\r\nclôture du verger, icelui verger compris en la présente concession et\r\nvente, les dix arpents de front joignant du côté du sud-ouest ou fief de\r\nla Trinité, appartenant au Séminaire, et du côté du nord-ouest à la terre\r\nde Jean Chattereau, ensemble la maison à deux étages, une grange et un\r\nétable en bois, construits sur les dits dix arpents.\"\r\n\r\n[_Translation_.]\r\n\r\n\"Charles Stewart, advocate and notary, residing at Quebec, proprietor of\r\nthe _Fief_ Grand Pré, formerly styled De la Mistanguenne or Mont\r\nPlaisir, at the Canardière, by deed of sale, bearing date the 26th June,\r\n1780, before Jean Ant. Panet, N.P., conceded _à titre de cens et rentes\r\nSeigneuriales_ ... to Mr. Jean Lees, junior, Simon Fraser, junior, and\r\nWilliam Wilson, merchants of this city, ten arpents, in front, situated in\r\nthe _Fief_ Grand Pré, or Montplaisir, at the Canardière, at the place\r\nnamed The Mountain or the Hermitage, beginning on one side, towards the\r\nsouth, at the lands of Joseph Bédard and Jean Baptiste LeRoux dit\r\nCardinal, and running in the depth towards the north, fourteen arpents or\r\nthereabouts, to the old orchard fence--said orchard included in this\r\nconcession and deed of sale, the ten arpents in part joining towards the\r\nnorth-west, to the _Fief de la Trinité_ belonging to the (Quebec)\r\nSeminary, and on the north-east side joining the land of Jean Chattereau,\r\ntogether with the two-story house, barn, wooden stable, built on the said\r\nten arpents.\"\r\n\r\nThe property was resold the 12th August, 1805, by John Lees, _et al._, to\r\nCharles Stewart, Esq., Comptroller of Customs, Quebec. It is now owned by\r\nLéger Brousseau, Esq.\r\n\r\n[323] The fascinating daughter of Lord Clifford, famous in the legendary\r\nhistory of England, as the mistress of Henry II. shortly before his\r\naccession to the throne, and the subject of an old ballad. She is said to\r\nhave been kept by her royal lover in a secret bower at Woodstock, the\r\napproaches to which formed a labyrinth so intricate that it could only be\r\ndiscovered by the clew of a silken thread, which the king used for that\r\npurpose. Here Queen Eleanor discovered and poisoned her, about 1173.--\r\n(_Noted names of Fiction_, 1175. See also Woodstock--_Waverley Novels_.)\r\n\r\n[324] I am indebted to my late old friend the Abbé Ferland for the\r\nfollowing remark: \"I visited Château Bigot during the summer of 1834. It\r\nwas in the state described by Mr. Papineau in the interior, the walls were\r\nstill partly papered. It must not be forgotten that about the beginning of\r\nthis century a club of _Bons-vivant_ used to meet frequently in the\r\nChâteau.\"\r\n\r\nThree celebrated clubs nourished here long before the Stadacona and St.\r\nJames' Club were thought of. The first was formed in Quebec, about the\r\nbeginning of this century. It was originally called (after its London\r\nprototype) says Lambert, the Beef Steak Club, which name it soon changed\r\nfor that of the Barons Club. It consisted of twenty-one members, \"who are\r\nchiefly the principal merchants in the colony, and are styled barons. As\r\nthe members drop off, their places are filled by knights elect, who are\r\nnot installed as barons until there is a sufficient number to pay for the\r\nentertainment which is given on that occasion.\" John Lambert, during the\r\nwinter of 1807, attended one of the banquets of installation, which was\r\ngiven in the Union Hotel (now the _Journal de Quebec_ office, facing\r\nthe Place d'Armes.) The Hon. Mr. Dunn, the President of the Province, and\r\nAdministrator, during the absence of Sir Robert S. Milnes, attended as the\r\noldest baron. The Chief Justice and all the principal officers of the\r\ngovernment, civil and military, were present. This entertainment cost 250\r\nguineas. \"The Barons Club,\" says W. Henderson, \"was a sort of _Pitt\r\nClub_,--all Tories to the back-bone. It was a very select affair--and\r\nof no long duration. Among the members, if my memory serves me right, were\r\nJohn Coltman, George Hamilton, Sir John Caldwell, Sir George Pownall,\r\nHerman Wistius Byland, George Heriott, (Postmaster and author) Hon.\r\nMatthew Bell, Gilbert Ainslie, Angus Shaw.\" (Notes of W. Henderson.)\r\n\r\nThe other club went under the appropriate name of \"Sober Club,\"--_lucus\r\na non lucendo_ perhaps: it flourished about 1811; we believe one of the\r\nBy-laws enacted that the members were expected to get _elevated_ at least\r\nonce a year. It seems to be more than likely that it was the Club of\r\nBarons, and not the Sober Club, who caroused under the romantic walls of\r\nthe Hermitage. The third Club flourished at Montreal in 1785 and later, it\r\ntook the name of the Beaver Club) and was, I believe, composed of old\r\n_Northwesters_.\r\n\r\n[325] It is painful to watch the successive inroads perpetrated by\r\nsportsmen and idlers on the old Château. In 1819, an old Quebecer, Mr.\r\nFrederick Wyse, visited it; doors, verandah, windows and everything else\r\nwas complete. He, too, lost his way in the woods, but found it again\r\nwithout the help of an Indian beauty. It was then known as the haunted\r\nhouse, supposed to contain a deal of French treasure, and called _La\r\nMaison du Bourg Royal_.\r\n\r\n[326] Error--he was a bachelor. These unions were not uncommon. We find\r\nthe Baron de St. Castin marrying Matilda, the daughter of Madocawando--an\r\nIndian beauty; he became a famous Indian Chief, helping D'Iberville, in\r\nAcadia, and left a numerous progeny of olive colored princesses with eyes\r\nlike a gazelle's.\r\n\r\n[327] Melospiza melodia.\r\n\r\n[328] Zonotrichia leuchophry.\r\n\r\n[329] The Hon. Mr. Dunn, Administrator of the Province in 1807, was the\r\nsenior baron; Hons. Matthew Bell, John Stewart, Messrs. Muir, Irvine,\r\nLester, McNaught, Grey Stewart, Munro, Finlay, Lymburner, Paynter; these\r\nnames were doubtless also to be found amongst the Canadian barons; the\r\nHon. Chas. de Lanaudière, once a general in the Hungarian service, was the\r\nonly French Canadian member.\r\n\r\n[330] Book of Carthon.\r\n\r\n[331] From Travellers' Guide Book, 1829.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n[332] See _Quebec Past and Present_, page 34.\r\n\r\n[333] Relation de 1665, p. 25, Journal des Jésuites, 10 juillet 1665.\r\n\r\n[334] Lettres de Marie de l'Incarnation, lettre 76e, p. 621.\r\n\r\n[335] Archives de la Marine, vol.

Dupeu,\r\n\r\n[344] In 1870, when these lines were penned, the massive gates, hoary with\r\nage, were already doomed--a portion of the materials like the stones of\r\nNelson's Abbey were robbed to build up houses near by.\r\n\r\n[345] Memoirs de P.A. DeGaspé.\r\n\r\n[346] The quips, pranks and _bon mots_ of this jolly corps would fill\r\na small volume.  The bar was represented by the witty Chief Justice\r\nVallière, the fun loving Charles Richard Ogden, afterwards Attorney-\r\nGeneral, and recently Judge of the Isle of Wight; and the army by a choice\r\nspirit of the 71st, Col. Denny.\r\n\r\n[347] Market and cemetery have since disappeared.\r\n\r\n[348] In this niche, at the time of the conquest, could be seen, just over\r\nthe door of the house, a statue of St John the Baptist. The inhabitants,\r\nfearing that the introduction of so many heretics in Sept., 1769, might\r\nsubject the saint's statue to slight, had conveyed it to the General\r\nHospital nunnery, where Mr. D. De Gaspé asserts, it is to this day. To\r\nfill its place, nothing occurred to the minds of the English, as more\r\nsuitable, than the wooden image of their young hero, Wolfe. As there is a\r\nclause in the title deeds of this property making it incumbent on the\r\nowners to maintain constantly in repair \"General Wolfe,\" the \"General\" it\r\nis to be hoped, will continue to flourish for many years yet--the only\r\nnotable difference being that, by his elevation of late years, he appears\r\ncloser to heaven than in the days of the Cholette Brothers, and therefore\r\nsafer from the attacks of practical jokers, middies, &c.\r\n\r\n[349] Where the Music Hall, Louis street, has since been erected. The\r\nfirst meeting of the Quebec City Corporation took place about 1834 in the\r\nsame house which Miss Napier had rented.\r\n\r\n[350] Wolfe and Montcalm's monument in process of erection in 1827, was\r\nrecently restored, thanks to the efforts of Hy. Fry, Esq., and of a few\r\nother public-spirited citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Picturesque Quebec, by James MacPherson Le Moine",
