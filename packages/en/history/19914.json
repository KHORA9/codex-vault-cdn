The book itself may be useful,\r\nnot, perhaps, to the Professor or to the Orientalist, but to the\r\ngeneral reader, and to the student commencing the study of Arabic. To\r\nthe latter it will give some idea of the vast field of Arabian\r\nliterature that lies before him, and prepare him, perhaps, for working\r\nout a really interesting work upon the subject. Such still remains to\r\nbe written in the English language, and it is to be hoped that it will\r\nbe done some day thoroughly and well.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to think that the study of Oriental languages and\r\nliterature is progressing in Europe generally, if not in England\r\nparticularly. The last Oriental Congress, held at Stockholm and\r\nChristiania the beginning of September, 1889, brought together a\r\ngoodly number of Oriental scholars. There were twenty-eight\r\nnationalities represented altogether, and the many papers prepared and\r\nread, or taken as read preparatory to their being printed, showed that\r\nmatters connected with Oriental studies in all their branches excite\r\nconsiderable interest.\r\n\r\nEngland, too, has been lately making some efforts which will be, it is\r\nsincerely hoped, crowned with success. The lectures on modern Oriental\r\nlanguages lately established by the Imperial Institute of the United\r\nKingdom, the Colonies, and India, in union with University College and\r\nKing's College, London, is full of promise of bringing forth good\r\nfruit hereafter. So much is to be learnt from Oriental literature in\r\nvarious ways that it is to be hoped the day may yet come when the\r\nstudy of one or more Oriental languages will be taken up as a pastime\r\nto fill the leisure hours of a future generation thirsting after\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, a movement is also being made to attempt to\r\nrevive the old Oriental Translation Fund. It was originally started in\r\nA.D. 1828, and did good work for fifty years, publishing translations\r\n(see Appendix) from fifteen different Oriental languages, and then\r\ncollapsing from apathy, neglect, and want of funds. Unless well\r\nsupported, both by donations and annual subscriptions, it is useless to\r\nattempt a fresh start. To succeed thoroughly it must be regarded as a\r\nnational institution, and sufficiently well-off to be able to afford to\r\nbring out Texts and Indexes of\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: Missing page in the source document.]\r\n\r\n-cially An-Nadim's 'Fihrist,' a most valuable book of reference, ought\r\nto be done into English without further delay. Private individuals can\r\nhardly undertake the business, but a well-organized and permanent\r\nOriental Translation Fund, assisted by the English and Indian\r\nGovernments, could and would render extraordinary services in the\r\npublication of texts, translations, and indexes of Oriental literature\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nFor assistance in the preparation of this present volume my thanks are\r\ndue to the many authors whose works have been freely used and quoted,\r\nand also to Mr. E. Rehatsek, of Bombay, whose knowledge of the Arabic\r\nlanguage and of Arabic literature is well known to all Oriental\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\nF.F.

This last boundary would, however, be more clearly\r\ndefined by drawing a line from Suez straight across to the western\r\nhead of the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nBy the Greeks and Romans this country was divided into Arabia Petræa,\r\nArabia Deserta, and Arabia Felix, or the Stony, the Desert, and the\r\nHappy. The Arabs themselves call it 'The Land of the Arabs,' while\r\nmodern geographers give the Sinaitic peninsula as the first geographic\r\ndistrict; the Hijaz, including the Haram, or sacred territory of\r\nMecca, as the second; and Yaman, with the Tehamah, as the third. To\r\nthese may be added the provinces of Hadramant and Mahrah, and of Oman\r\nand Hasa, to the south and east respectively, with Nejd, or Central\r\nArabia, as the central plateau, and some large deserts scattered in\r\ndifferent parts of the peninsula.\r\n\r\nOf the revenues of Arabia it is almost impossible to form anything\r\nlike a correct estimate. The area of the country covers about\r\n1,200,000 square miles, and the population is said to be from five to\r\nsix millions, of whom one-fifth consist of Ahl Bedoo, or dwellers in\r\nthe open land, otherwise known as Bedouins; and four-fifths of\r\nsettled Arabs, called Ahl Hadr, or dwellers in fixed localities.\r\n\r\nThe history of Arabia may be divided into three periods:\r\n\r\n1st. The prehistoric period, full of tales of heroes, and giants, and\r\nwonderful cities.\r\n\r\n2nd. The period which preceded the era of Muhammad.\r\n\r\n3rd. That which followed it.\r\n\r\nThe first period is mythical to a certain extent; at all events,\r\nnothing can be stated positively about it. The second period is\r\ndistinguished as one of local monarchies and federal governments in a\r\nrough and rude form; while the third commences with theocratic\r\ncentralization, dissolving finally into general anarchy.\r\n\r\nOf the many tribes in Arabia, the most celebrated is the family of the\r\nKoraish, still regarded as the noblest of the Arabs, partly because,\r\nat the beginning of the fifth century A.D., their chiefs had rendered\r\nthemselves the masters and acknowledged guardians of the sacred Kaabah\r\nat Mecca, and partly because of their connection with the Prophet. The\r\nKaabah, La Maison Carrée, or square temple, a shrine of unknown\r\nantiquity, was situated within the precincts of the town of Mecca, and\r\nto it, long before Muhammad's time, the Arabs had brought yearly\r\nofferings, and made devout pilgrimages. The tribe of Koraish, having\r\nonce obtained the keys of the consecrated building, had held them\r\nagainst all comers till Muhammad's conquest of Mecca in A.D. 630, when\r\nhe handed over the key to Othman bin Talha, the former custodian, to\r\nbe kept by him and his posterity as an hereditary and perpetual\r\noffice, and he further confirmed his uncle Abbas in the office of\r\ngiving drink to the pilgrims.\r\n\r\nBefore entering into a somewhat lengthy description of Arabian\r\nliterature, it is necessary to give a short and rapid sketch of\r\nArabian history, beginning from the time of Muhammad, as his Koran was\r\nthe foundation of the literary edifice. All Arab authors have looked\r\nupon that work as the height of eloquent diction, and have regarded it\r\nas the model standard to be followed in all their productions.\r\nLeaving, then, the two first periods of Arabian history, viz., the\r\nprehistoric, and the pre-Muhammadan, without any particular notice,\r\nthe third period will be sketched as briefly as possible, and will be\r\nfound excessively interesting, containing as it does the rise,\r\ngrandeur, and decline of the Arabs as a nation.\r\n\r\nMuhammad, on his death in June, A.D. 632, left the entire Arab\r\npeninsula, with two or three exceptions, under one sceptre and one\r\ncreed. He was succeeded by Abu Bakr (the father of Ayesha, the\r\nfavourite wife of the prophet), known as the Companion of the Cave,\r\nwith the title of Khalifah, or successor. His reign only lasted two\r\nyears, but during that period the various insurrections that broke out\r\nin Arabia in consequence of the death of the Prophet were promptly put\r\ndown, after severe fighting, in various parts of the peninsula, and\r\nthe whole country was subjugated. Foreign expeditions beyond the\r\nborders were also planned and started.\r\n\r\nAbu Bakr, dying in August, A.D. 634, was succeeded by Umar, or Omar,\r\nthe conqueror of Syria, Persia, and Egypt by means of his generals\r\nKhalid bin Walid (the best, perhaps, that Islam produced), Abu Obaida,\r\nMothanna, Sád bin Malik, Amr bin al-Aasi, and others. Omar himself was\r\nan early convert of A.D. 615, and a sudden conversion like our Paul;\r\nbut one made his converts by fanaticism and the sword, the other by\r\npreaching and the pen. After a glorious and victorious reign of ten\r\nyears Omar was assassinated by a Persian slave in November, A.D. 644,\r\nand was followed as Khalif by Othman, son of Affan, of the noble\r\nfamily of Abd-esh-Shems, who also assumed the title 'Amir al-Momenin,\r\nor Commander of the Faithful, which had been first adopted by his\r\npredecessor Omar. Othman ruled for twelve years, when he was murdered\r\nin A.D. 656, some say at the instigation of Ali, nephew of Muhammad,\r\nand husband of his only daughter Fatima. Anyhow, Ali succeeded Othman\r\nas Khalif, but was defeated by Moawia, Governor of Syria, and\r\nassassinated in A.D. 660.\r\n\r\nMoawia bin Abu Sofyan then established the Benou Umayya dynasty,\r\ncalled by Europeans the Omaiyides, or Ommiades, from the name of\r\nUmayya, the father of the race. This dynasty reigned for nearly ninety\r\nyears, and numbered fourteen successive princes, with their capital at\r\nDamascus.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Yazid I., the second prince (A.D. 679-683),\r\nHussain, the younger son of Ali the Khalif, came to an untimely end.\r\nHis elder brother, Hasan, a man of quiet disposition, had been\r\npreviously murdered by one of his wives, at the instigation, it is\r\nsaid, of Yazid before he came to the throne. This happened in A.D.\r\n669. Later on Hussain, with his followers, rose in rebellion, and was\r\nkilled on the plain of Kerbela, A.D. 680. The descendants, however, of\r\nthis faction continued the disturbances which eventually brought about\r\nthe great Muhammadan schism, and the splitting up of the religion into\r\ntwo sects, known to this day as the Sunnis and Shias. The adherents of\r\nthe legitimate Khalifate, and of the orthodox doctrine, assumed the\r\nname of Sunnites, or Traditionists. These acknowledge the first four\r\nKhalifs (the rightly minded, or rightly directed, as they are called)\r\nto have been legitimate successors of Muhammad, while the sectaries of\r\nAli are known as the Shiites, or Separatists. These last regard Ali as\r\nthe first rightful Imam, for they prefer this title (found in Sura\r\nii., verse 118, of the Koran) to that of Khalif. The Turks and Arabs\r\nare Sunnis: the Persians, and most of the Muhammadans of India, Shias.\r\n\r\nThis division into two sects, who hate each other cordially, has done\r\nmore to weaken the power of the Muhammadan religion as a power than\r\nanything else. The Shias to this day execrate the memory of Yazid as\r\nthe murderer of their hero Hussain, whom they have ever regarded as a\r\nmartyr, and given full vent to their feelings on the subject in their\r\n'Passion Play,' translated by Sir Lewis Pelly, and described by Mr.\r\nBenjamin in his 'Persia and the Persians.'\r\n\r\nOther insurrections against the reigning Omaiyide Khalifs were also\r\nput down, portions of Asia, Africa and Spain conquered, and even\r\nFrance invaded, so that at the close of the Benou Umayya dynastry,\r\nabout A.D. 750, their empire consisted of many and large territories\r\nin Europe, Africa and Asia. Their colour was white, as opposed to the\r\nblack of the Abbasides, and the green of the Fatimites, as descendants\r\nof Muhammad.\r\n\r\nBut the Benou Umayya dynasty succumbed, A.D. 749, under the blows of\r\nIbrahim (great-grandson of Abbas, the uncle of the Prophet), and of\r\nhis younger brother, Abul Abbas, better known in history as As-Saffah,\r\nor the Blood-shedder. A decisive battle was fought on the banks of the\r\nriver Zab, near Arbela, and Marwan II. (A.D. 744-750), the last of the\r\nOmaiyide Khalifs, was defeated, and fled first to Damascus, and then\r\nto Egypt, where he was eventually killed by his pursuers, A.D. 750.\r\n\r\nThe history of the reign of the Abbasides now begins, and under them\r\nthe power and glory of Islam reached their highest point. But it is\r\nfirst necessary to allude to the conquest of Spain by the Omaiyides, a\r\nbranch of which family still retained for a long time in the West the\r\npower which they had totally lost in the East.\r\n\r\nThe most important achievement of the reign of Walid I. (A.D.\r\n705-715), the sixth prince of the Omaiyide dynasty, was the conquest\r\nof Spain by his generals Tarik and Musa. The Arabs (known in Europe\r\nunder the name of Saracens) first established themselves in Cordova\r\nabout A.D. 711, and the two generals above named continued their\r\nvictorious progress throughout the country in 712 and 713, until\r\nnearly nine-tenths of the peninsula was held by the Muhammadans.\r\n\r\nSome years later France even was invaded by the Arabs, and the banners\r\nof the Muslims were erected on the coasts of the Gulf of Lyons, on the\r\nwalls of Narbonne, of Nimes, of Carcassonne, and of Béziers. The Arabs\r\nafterwards advanced as far as the plains of Tours, where their\r\nvictorious progress was checked by Charles Martel, who gained a great\r\nvictory over them near that town in October, A.D. 732, and completely\r\ndefeated them, so that they were obliged to retire again to Spain.\r\nThere successive viceroys and emirs ruled as the representatives of\r\nthe Khalifs at Damascus until the fall of the Omaiyide dynasty in the\r\nEast, A.D. 750.\r\n\r\nBut even after that Spain remained for many years under Arab\r\ndomination. Anarchy almost prevailed from A.D. 750 to 755, but in that\r\nyear the Arabs of Spain, weary of disorder, elected as their ruler\r\nAbd-ar-Rahman, grandson of the Khalif Hashim, tenth prince of the\r\nOmaiyide dynasty. At the time of his election, Abd-ar-Rahman was a\r\nwanderer in the desert, pursued by his enemies, when a deputation from\r\nAndalusia sought him out and offered him the Khalifate of Spain. It\r\nwas gladly accepted. He landed there in September, A.D. 755, was\r\nuniversally welcomed, and founded at Cordova the Western Omaiyide\r\nKhalifate, which lasted up to A.D. 1031, under sixteen rulers, with\r\ncertain interruptions during the reign of the last seven of them. On\r\nthe extinction of the Khalifate, Spain was broken up into various\r\npetty kingdoms under kings and kinglets belonging to different Arab\r\ntribes and families. This continued from A.D. 1032 to 1092, when the\r\nAlmoravides established themselves from A.D. 1092 to 1147, and were\r\nfollowed by the Almohades, who reigned up to A.D. 1232.\r\n\r\nAfter this Cordova, Seville, and other places were taken by Ferdinand\r\nIII. of Leon and Castile, between A.D. 1236 and 1248. On the fall of\r\nCordova the Muhammadan power declined with great rapidity; and, though\r\nthe celebrated kingdom of Granada was established by the Moors in A.D.\r\n1232, it was their last refuge from the rising power of the\r\nChristians. Some twenty-one princes reigned there till A.D. 1492, when\r\nGranada itself was taken, and this last Muhammadan dynasty was driven\r\nout of Spain by Ferdinand of Arragon and Isabella of Castile. Thus\r\nended the empire of the Arabs and the Moors in Spain, which had lasted\r\nnearly eight hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Arabs were extremely fond of learning. Indeed, it is due\r\nto them to a very great extent that literature and science were kept\r\nafloat in Europe during the ages that followed the invasion of the\r\nBarbarians, as the Huns, Vandals, Goths, and Visigoths were generally\r\ncalled. That interval known as the 'Dark Ages' was kept alight by the\r\nArabs alone. Abd-ar-Rahman II. established a library at Cordova during\r\nhis reign, A.D. 822-852. Hakim II., the successor of Abd-ar-Rahman\r\nIII., loved the sciences, founded the University of Cordova, and\r\ncollected a library of great magnitude (A.D. 961-976).\r\n\r\nThe revival of learning in Europe is chiefly attributed to the\r\nwritings of Arabian doctors and philosophers, and to the schools which\r\nthey founded in several parts of Spain and Italy. These seats of\r\nlearning were frequented even in the twelfth century of our era by\r\nstudents from various parts of Europe, who disseminated the knowledge\r\nthus acquired when they returned to their own countries. At that time\r\nmany Arabic works were translated into Latin, which thus facilitated\r\nthe progress of science. In the three last chapters of the second book\r\nof the 'History of the Muhammadan Dynasties in Spain,' translated by\r\nPascual de Gayangos, the state of science and literature is detailed\r\nin the words of Makkari, the original Arab author of that work, and in\r\nit many once celebrated authors are mentioned, of whom not only their\r\nproductions, but even their very names, have since perished. The\r\ndistinguished writers whose works have come down to us will be more\r\nparticularly alluded to in the next chapter. Europe is also indebted\r\nto the Arabs for the elements of many useful sciences, particularly\r\nthat of chemistry. Paper was first made in Europe by them, and their\r\ncarpets and manufactures in steel and leather were long unrivalled,\r\nwhile in the Arabian schools of Cordova mathematics, astronomy,\r\nphilosophy, botany and medicine were taught with great success.\r\n\r\nAs Europe gradually emerged from darkness and ignorance, the Moors in\r\nSpain became so weak and powerless that in A.D. 1526 Charles I of\r\nSpain, and V. of Germany, ordered them to adopt the Spanish language.\r\nIn A.D. 1566 an edict of Philip II. forbade them to speak or write in\r\nArabic, and directed them to renounce all their traditional habits,\r\ncustoms and ceremonies. Philip III. completed the work which his\r\nfather had left unfinished. In A.D. 1609 all the Moriscoes were\r\nordered to depart from the peninsula within three days, with a penalty\r\nof death if they failed to obey the order, and from that time their\r\nexistence as a nation finally ceased in Europe, and Spain thus lost a\r\nmillion of industrious inhabitants skilled in the useful arts. After\r\ntheir expulsion Arabic literature more or less disappeared. Much of it\r\nwas destroyed, and a Spanish cardinal, it is said, once boasted that\r\nhe had destroyed with his own hands one hundred thousand Arabic\r\nmanuscripts! It is highly probable that the remnants of Andalusian\r\nlibraries were brought to light by Casiri (b. 1710, d. 1791) during\r\nthe past, and by Gayangos during the present century, and it is\r\ndoubtful if much more will ever now be discovered.\r\n\r\nThere are two buildings still extant in Spain which have survived the\r\nArabs, viz., their mosque at Cordova (now the Cathedral), and their\r\npalace of the Alhambra at Granada, both well worth a visit, and well\r\ndescribed in Murray's and O'Shea's guides to Spain. During the reign\r\nof Abd-ar-Rahman III. (A.D. 912-961) the city, palace, and gardens of\r\nMedinatu-z-Ahra, three or four miles from Cordova, were constructed in\r\nhonour of his favourite wife or mistress, Az-zahra, and cost an\r\nimmense sum of money. At present no vestiges of them exist, and it is\r\nsupposed that not only these, but many other Arab mosques and\r\nbuildings, were intentionally destroyed by their conquerors, as the\r\nhatred between the Christian and the Muslim in those days was of the\r\nbitterest description.\r\n\r\nAnd now to return to the Abbasides, established in the East on the\r\ndownfall of the Omaiyide dynasty there in A.D. 750, and thus continue\r\nthe main line of Arab history.\r\n\r\nThere were, in all, thirty-seven Abbaside Khalifs, of whom Abu Jaafar,\r\nsurnamed Al-Mansur, the Victorious (A.D. 754-775), Harun-ar-Rashid\r\n(A.D. 786-809), and Al-Mamun (A.D. 812-833) were the most celebrated.\r\nOf these, the first, who was the second Khalif, founded Baghdad, the\r\ncapital of the Abbasides, about A.D. 762; the second, who was the\r\nfifth Khalif, has been rendered immortal by the frequent illusions to\r\nhim, and to members of the Barmeki family, in the 'Arabian Nights';\r\nwhile the third, who was the seventh Khalif, was a great patron of\r\nliterature and science.\r\n\r\nAs years rolled on the dynasty and its princes became weaker and\r\nweaker, and finally came to an end under the thirty-seventh and last\r\nKhalif Al-Mustaa 'sim Billah, with the capture of Baghdad in A.D. 1258\r\nby Halaku Khan, the sovereign of the Mughals, and the grandson of\r\nJenghiz Khan.\r\n\r\nLong before this, however, the empire which the first of the Abbasides\r\nhad conquered was already broken up. About A.D. 879, in Persia,\r\nAmr-bin-Lais founded the Suffary or Braiser dynasty, still subject to\r\nthe Commander of the Faithful. But even this allegiance only lasted\r\ntill A.D. 901, when the Samani and Dailami dynasties were established\r\nin the North and South of Persia respectively, and quite independent\r\nof the Khalifs of Baghdad.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 909, the Fatimites, so designated from one Obaid Allah, a real\r\nor pretended descendant of Ali and Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad,\r\nestablished themselves in the North of Africa, and consolidated their\r\npower there. In A.D. 972 Al-Moizz, or Abu Tamim, a great-grandson of\r\nObaid Allah, the founder of the Fatimite dynasty at Tunis, sent his\r\ngeneral Jawhar with an army to invade Egypt. The country was\r\nconquered, the city of Cairo built, the seat of government was\r\ntransferred there, and the title of Khalif assumed by the Fatimites.\r\nThere they remained as reigning Khalifs until A.D. 1171, when\r\nSalah-ad-Din (Saladin) usurped the sovereignty, and founded the\r\nAyoobite dynasty of Kurds, till its last ruler, Melik-al-Ashraf, was\r\ndeposed in A.D. 1250 by the Mamlook El Moizz, who in that year founded\r\nthe Baharite Mamlook dynasty, which lasted with variations in the\r\nfamilies till A.D. 1377. But in A.D. 1260 Ez-Zahir Beybars, a Mamlook\r\nslave, secured the throne, and brought the then representative of the\r\nAbbaside Khalifs (the family having been dethroned by the Mughals at\r\nBaghdad in A.D. 1258) to Egypt, and recognised him as possessing\r\nspiritual authority alone, but nothing else. From that time until the\r\ntaking of Egypt by Sultan Selim I. in A.D. 1517, the Abbaside Khalifs\r\nretained the spiritual power first under the Baharite, and then under\r\nthe Circassian or Borgite Mamlooks. When Egypt became a Turkish\r\npashalic, Selim, the conqueror, compelled the representative of the\r\nAbbaside Khalifs, by name Al-Motawukkel, to leave Cairo and reside in\r\nConstantinople; and on his death the Ottoman Sultans assumed the title\r\nof Khalif, which they hold to this day, and are recognised by the\r\nSunnis as the head of the Muhammadan religion, and the successors of\r\nMuhammad.\r\n\r\nAs regards Syria and Palestine (two countries more or less closely\r\nconnected, owing to their proximity and absence of distinct and\r\ndefined boundaries), on the termination of the rule of the Omaiyides\r\nat Damascus in A.D. 750, they remained nominally under the Abbasides\r\ntill A.D. 969, when Syria was conquered by the Fatimites, who were\r\nsucceeded by the Seljuks, who captured Damascus about A.D. 1075, and\r\nAntioch A.D. 1085. The struggles with the Crusaders commenced in A.D.\r\n1096, and continued until Saladin's famous victory at Hattin in 1187,\r\nwhen he became master of nearly the whole of Syria and Palestine.\r\nFighting still went on in these countries between the Franks and\r\nothers until A.D. 1518, when Selim I. conquered the country and\r\nincorporated it with the Turkish Empire. No Arab prince has since\r\nreigned in Egypt or Syria, though these countries have always\r\nexercised certain influences over Arabia.\r\n\r\nIn Arabia itself, towards the end of the tenth century and the\r\nbeginning of the eleventh, A.D., the Karmathians had risen in revolt,\r\nand detached that country from the Abbaside dynasty to such an extent\r\nthat she returned almost to her primitive independence. Indeed, it may\r\nbe said that, in the whole of Arabia, the Hijaz, with the Haram, or\r\nsacred territory of Mecca, under the Shariff, or nobles, the lineal\r\ndescendants of the tribe of Koraish, alone retained some kind of\r\nconstituted authority, and paid allegiance sometimes to the government\r\nof Baghdad, and sometimes to that of Egypt.\r\n\r\nAs already stated above, in A.D. 1517 the Turkish Sultan Selim I.\r\nconquered Egypt, and obtained from the last real, or supposed\r\nsurviving, Abbaside kinsman of the Prophet a formal investiture of the\r\nMuhammadan Khalifate. This was more religious than political in its\r\nbearing, but still many of the tribes in Arabia offered their\r\nallegiance to the Ottoman Government. From that time the Turks began\r\ntheir dealings with Arabia, which remained in a sort of independence\r\nunder their own tribal Shaikhs, more or less according to the\r\ncircumstances of different districts, until the rise of the Wahhabi\r\nmovement, about the middle of the eighteenth century of our era.\r\n\r\nThe Wahhabi reform movement requires special mention. It began in\r\nArabia about A.D. 1740. The reformer and originator of the movement\r\nwas Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab, born at the town of Aïnah, in the\r\ncentre of the Nejd district, A.D. 1691. He died in A.D. 1787, aged\r\nninety-six. After some years spent in travel and in study, he began\r\nhis preaching about A.D. 1731. Driven from Aïnah, his native place, as\r\nMuhammad was driven from Mecca, Abdul Wahhab established himself at\r\nad-Diriyyah, where Muhammad bin Saood, the Shaikh of a sub-tribe of\r\nthe Anizeh, gave him shelter, and eventually married his daughter. By\r\npreaching and fighting, his followers increased in number, and his\r\nreforms spread throughout the Nejd district, and many converts were\r\nmade by him and his successors.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1797 a Turkish army from Baghdad attacked the Wahhabis, but\r\nwere beaten, and two years later Saood II. took and plundered Kerbela,\r\nTaif, Mecca, and other places, and seems to have retained his power\r\nand his government for several years.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1811 the Turks, who had quite lost their authority in Arabia,\r\nrequested Muhammad Ali of Egypt to put down the movement, and\r\nreconquer the country. The first expedition, commanded by his son\r\nTussun, in its attempt to take Madinah, was nearly annihilated, but\r\nsucceeded the following year. Later on the campaign was conducted by\r\nMuhammad Ali in person, and afterwards by his adopted son Ibrahim\r\nPasha, with considerable success. The final stronghold, ad-Diriyyah,\r\nwas captured in A.D. 1818, the Wahhabi chief captured, and sent first\r\nto Egypt and then to Constantinople, where he was beheaded in December\r\nof that year.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian occupation of Arabia was followed by a renewal of the\r\nWahhabi movement, which eventually succeeded, in A.D. 1842, in driving\r\nout the Egyptians, occupied as they were at the time with fighting the\r\nTurks in Syria and Anatolia. Wahhabism was then re-established in some\r\nparts, and independence in other parts, of the country; but on the\r\nwhole Wahhabism has never been very popular either in Arabia or India,\r\nin which latter country it also has some followers. It may be regarded\r\nas the latest sect of Islam, but does not make much progress.\r\n\r\nArabia may now be said to be under three different kinds of\r\ngovernment--_i.e._, partly under the Wahhabis, partly under the Turks,\r\nand partly under independent rulers, while Aden has been held by the\r\nEnglish ever since its first capture in A.D. 1839. In other words, the\r\npresent position of Arabia may be more definitely described as\r\nfollows: Hasa, Hareek, the whole of Nejd, Kaseem, the provinces\r\nadjoining Yaman on the north, and Aseer, forming a broad belt, and\r\nstretching across the centre of the peninsula from the Red Sea to the\r\nPersian Gulf, remain under Wahhabi influences. The Hijaz and some\r\nsea-ports, such as Jedda and others, are at present absolutely under\r\nthe Turkish Government; while Bahrein, Oman and its capital Muscat,\r\nand Yaman are more or less independent. Between Nejd and Syria a new\r\nand promising kingdom has sprung up under Telal.\r\n\r\nThe time perhaps may come, and perhaps not far distant, when the Turks\r\nwill disappear altogether from Arabia, and Wahhabism and independent\r\ntribes will alone remain. Another Muhammad or another Abdul Wahhab may\r\nsome day again appear, and bring together the tribes under one rule\r\nfor a time. It is doubtful, though, if ever the Arabs will again have\r\nthe power, talent, or enthusiasm to revive the glories of the Arabian\r\nEmpire, which now lives in history only, and is well worth a study.\r\n\r\nFor ready reference the following is a chronology of the dynasty of\r\nthe Ornaiyides, preceded by Muhammad and the first Khalifahs:\r\n\r\n                                     A.D.\r\n        Muhammad the Apostle      622--632\r\n        Abu Bakr                  632--634\r\n        Omar I.                   634--643\r\n        Othman                    643--655\r\n        Ali                       655--660\r\n     1.

Will history repeat\r\nitself in the same way as regards Constantinople, which in some years\r\nmay be the only territory left in Europe to a people who once were\r\nconquerors, and whose arms even were carried to the walls of Vienna?\r\nAs Persia, Egypt, Syria, parts of Africa and Arabia, by degrees, were\r\nsevered from the Abbaside Empire, so the different provinces of Turkey\r\nin Europe appear to be slowly separating themselves from the Turkish\r\nPower, until finally there will be nothing left to them in Europe but\r\nthat city whose splendid position will ever make it a bone of\r\ncontention to both rising and declining States.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the Omaiyides who ruled in Spain a.d. 756\r\nto 1031:\r\n\r\n                                A.D.\r\n     1.

For\r\nthe last twelve centuries no Western language has preserved its\r\ngrammar, its style, or its literature intact and intelligible to the\r\npeople of the present day. But two Eastern tongues have come down from\r\nages past to our own times, and continue to exist unchanged in books,\r\nand, to a certain extent, also unchanged in language, and these are\r\nChinese and Arabic. In China, though the dialects differ in the\r\nvarious provinces of the empire, still the written language has\r\nremained the same for centuries. In Arabia the Arabic language has\r\nretained its originality without very much dialectical alteration.\r\n\r\nThe unchangeable character of the Arabic language is chiefly to be\r\nattributed to the Koran, which has, from its promulgation to the\r\npresent time, been regarded by all Muhammadans as the standard of\r\nreligion and of literary composition. Strictly speaking, not only the\r\nhistory, but also the literature of the Arabs begins with Muhammad.\r\nExcepting the Mua'llakat, and other pre-Islamitic poems collected in\r\nthe Hamasas of Abu Tammam and Al-Bohtori, in Ibn Kutaiba and in the\r\nMofaddhaliat, no literary monuments that preceded his time are in\r\nexistence. The Koran became, not only the code of religious and of\r\ncivil law, but also the model of the Arabic language, and the standard\r\nof diction and eloquence. Muhammad himself scorned metrical rules; he\r\nclaimed as an apostle and lawgiver a title higher than that of\r\nsoothsayer and poet. Still, his poetic talent is manifest in numerous\r\npassages of the Koran, well known to those able to read it in the\r\noriginal, and in this respect the last twenty-five chapters of that\r\nbook are, perhaps, the most remarkable.\r\n\r\nAlthough the power of the Arabs has long ago succumbed, their\r\nliterature has survived, and their language is still more or less\r\nspoken in all Muhammadan countries. Europe at one time was lightened\r\nby the torch of Arabian learning, and the Middle Ages were stamped\r\nwith the genius and character of Arab civilization. The great masters\r\nof philosophy, medicine, astronomy, and mathematics, viz., Al-Kindi,\r\nAl-Farabi, Ibn-Sina, Ibn-Rashid, Ibn Bajah, Razi, Al Battani, Abul\r\nMa'shar, Al-Farghani, Al-Jaber, have been studied both in the Spanish\r\nuniversities and in those of the rest of Europe, where their names are\r\nstill familiar under the corrupted forms of Alchendius, Alfarabius,\r\nAvicenna, Averroes, Avempace, Rhazes, Albategnius, Albumasar,\r\nAlfraganius, and Geber.\r\n\r\nArabic literature commenced about half a century before Muhammad with\r\na legion of poets. The seven poems suspended in the temple of Mecca,\r\nand of which more anon, were considered as the chief productions of\r\nthat time. The Mussulman era begins with the Hijrah, or emigration of\r\nMuhammad from Mecca to Madinah, which is supposed to have taken place\r\non the 20th of June, A.D. 622; and the rise, growth, and decay of Arab\r\npower, learning, and literature may be divided into three periods as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    1. The time before Muhammad.\r\n\r\n    2. From Muhammad and his immediate successors, viz., Abu Bakr,\r\nOmar, Othman, and Ali, through the Omaiyide and Abbaside dynasties, to\r\nthe end of the Khalifate of Baghdad, A.D. 1258.\r\n\r\n    3. From the fall of Baghdad to the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Period.\r\n\r\nAlthough the proper history of Arabian literature begins from the time\r\nof Muhammad, it is necessary to cast a glance upon the age that\r\npreceded him, in order to obtain a glimpse of pre-Islamitic wisdom.\r\nThe sage Lokman, whose name the thirty-first chapter of the Koran\r\nbears, is considered, according to that book, to have been the first\r\nman of his nation who practised and taught wisdom in all his deeds and\r\nwords. He was believed to have been a contemporary of David and\r\nSolomon; his sayings and his fables still exist, but there is not much\r\nreally known about him, as the following extracts will show:\r\n\r\n'Lokman, a philosopher mentioned in the Koran, is said to have been\r\nborn about the time of David. One tradition represents him as a\r\ndescendant of the Arab tribe of Ad, who, on account of his piety and\r\nwisdom, was saved when the rest of his family perished by Divine\r\nwrath. According to another story he was an Ethiopian slave, noted\r\nalike for bodily deformity and a gift for composing fables and\r\napologues. This account of Lokman, resembling so closely the\r\ntraditional history of Æsop, has led to an opinion that they were the\r\nsame individual, but this is now generally supposed not to be the\r\ncase. The various reports agree in ascribing to Lokman extraordinary\r\nlongevity. His extant fables bear evident marks of modern alteration,\r\nboth in their diction and their incidents. They were first published\r\nwith a Latin translation of the Arabic by Erpenius (Leyden, 1615).\r\nGalland produced a French translation of the fables of Lokman and\r\nBidpay at Paris in 1724, and there are other editions by De Sacey,\r\n1816, Caussin de Perceval, 1818, Freytag, 1823, and Rodiger, 1830.'\r\n\r\nBurton, in a footnote to page 118, of Volume X. of his 'Arabian\r\nNights,' however, says that 'There are three distinct Lokmans. The\r\nfirst, or eldest Lokman, entitled Al-Hakim (the Sage), and the hero of\r\nthe Koranic chapter which bears his name, was son of Ba'ura, of the\r\nchildren of Azar, sister's son to Job, or son of Job's maternal aunt;\r\nhe witnessed David's miracles of mail-making, and when the tribe of Ad\r\nwas destroyed he became king of the country. The second Lokman, also\r\ncalled the Sage, was a slave and Abyssinian negro, sold by the\r\nIsraelites during the reign of David or Solomon, and who left a volume\r\nof proverbs and exempla, not fables or apologues, some of which still\r\ndwell in the public memory. The youngest Lokman, of the Vultures, was\r\na prince of the tribe of Ad, who lived 3,500 years, the age of seven\r\nvultures.'\r\n\r\nThis accounts for the different ideas as regards the tradition of one\r\nLokman in the preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\nBefore the era of the Prophet poetry had attained some degree of\r\nexcellence. At the annual festival of Okatz the poets met and made\r\npublic recitations, and competed for prizes. Of prose literature there\r\nwas none, and the irregular, half-rhythmical, half-rhyming sentences\r\nof the Koran were the first attempts in the direction of prose.\r\n\r\nPassing over the host of pre-Islamitic poets, the disputed time and\r\norder in which they appeared, as well as the ranks they respectively\r\noccupied, it will only be necessary here to describe the Arabic idyll\r\nor elegy (Kasida), and to notice the authors of the seven famous\r\nMua'llakat, or suspended, or strung-together poems of the temple of\r\nMecca, already alluded to above. As these poems were written in\r\nletters of gold, they were also called Muzahhibat, or \"gilded.\"\r\nAccording to Arab notions, the subjects of a poet are four or five. He\r\npraises, loves, is angry, mourns, or describes either female beauty,\r\nanimals, or objects of nature. Poems comprising one of these subjects\r\nonly are short, but those treating of several are longer, and contain\r\neulogies of chiefs, rulers, distinguished men and women, etc. The poet\r\ntouches on the valour, liberality and eloquence of the hero, on the\r\nbeauty and virtues of the woman, and describes the nearest\r\nsurroundings, which are of the greatest interest, such as the horse,\r\nthe camel, the antelope, the ostrich, the wild cow, the cloud, the\r\nlightning, wine, the vestiges of the tent of the beloved, and the\r\nhospitable camp-fire.\r\n\r\nThe Kasidas of the Mua'llakat are a series of smaller poems, composed\r\non various occasions, and then strung together in one piece. Among\r\nthem the two Kasidas of Amra-al-Kais (Amriolkais), and of Antara, are\r\nthe most brilliant and romantic, on account of the sentiments of love\r\nthey breathe towards the three beauties--Oneiza, Fatima, and Abla. The\r\nKasida of Labid is famous for his description of both the camel and\r\nthe horse; that of Tarafa for the delineation of the camel; that of\r\nAmru for the picture of a battle; while Harath chanted the praises of\r\narms, and of the King of Hirah, and Zoheir produced a poem full of\r\nwise maxims. The whole seven contain a great deal about the personal\r\nfeelings, the personal courage, the heroic deeds, and the wonderful\r\nadventures of the authors themselves--to which may be added\r\ndescriptions of various animals, of hunting scenes, and of battle, the\r\nconventional lament for the absence or departure of a mistress, the\r\ndelight of meeting her, and other bright sketches of Arab life in camp\r\nand on the march, with its joys, its sorrows, and its constant\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nSir William Jones first brought these poems to the notice of the West,\r\nand published a translation of them in A.D. 1782. 'They exhibit,' he\r\nsays, 'an exact picture of the virtues and the vices, the wisdom and\r\nthe folly, of the early Arabs. The poems show what may constantly be\r\nexpected from men of open hearts and boiling passions, with no law to\r\ncontrol, and little religion to restrain them.'\r\n\r\nThe above translations, with notes and remarks, have been reprinted by\r\nMr. W.A. Clouston, in his 'Arabian Poetry for English Readers,' at\r\nGlasgow in 1881, and is a work well worthy of a perusal by any persons\r\nwho may be interested in the subject.\r\n\r\nThe names of the three ancient Arab poets considered to have been\r\npossessed of equal talent with the authors of the Mua'llakat, are\r\nNabiga, Al-Kama, and Al-Aasha, and some specimens of their\r\ncomposition, as also of those of other pre-Islamite poets, are to be\r\nfound in the fifteenth volume, No. 39, pages 65-108, of the 'Bombay\r\nBranch of the Royal Asiatic Society,' translated by Mr. E. Rehatsek in\r\n1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Period.\r\n\r\nFrom Muhammad and his immediate successors (Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman and\r\nAli), through the Omaiyide and Abbaside dynasties, to the end of the\r\nKhalifate of Baghdad, A.D. 1258.\r\n\r\nThe legislator of Islam, whose era began on the 16th July, A.D. 622\r\n(though his actual departure from Mecca has been calculated to have\r\ntaken place on the 20th June, A.D. 622), is here to be considered not\r\nfrom an historical, but from a poetical point of view. Although\r\nMuhammad despised the metres in which the bards of his nation chanted\r\ntheir Kasidas, and himself gave utterance in the name of Heaven to the\r\ninspirations of his genius only in richly-modulated and rhymed prose,\r\nnevertheless, according to the Oriental idea, he was regarded as a\r\npoet. Those who declare that he was not a poet overlook the\r\ncircumstance that he was vehemently assailed by contemporary poets,\r\nwho attempted to degrade his heaven-inspired Surahs into mere poetical\r\nfables. He himself protested against this insinuation, and declared at\r\nthe end of the 26th Surah, entitled 'The Poets,' that those are in\r\nerror who believe poets, as follows:\r\n\r\n'And those who err follow the poets; dost thou not see how they roam\r\n(as bereft of their senses) through every valley (of the imagination)\r\nand that they say things which they do not perform? ... Except those\r\nwho believe, and do good works, and remember God frequently, and those\r\nwho defend themselves after they have been unjustly treated by poets\r\nin their lampoons, and they who act unjustly shall know hereafter with\r\nwhat treatment they shall be treated.'\r\n\r\nThese lines are important as far as the history of literature is\r\nconcerned. They are written against inimical poets, but distinguish\r\nthe friendly ones, who, taking the part of Muhammad, repaid the\r\nlampooning poets in their own coin.\r\n\r\nSome of the hostile poets, such as Hobeira and the woman Karitha, were\r\nkilled at the taking of Mecca, whilst Zibary and the woman Hertlemah\r\nsaved their lives only by making a profession of Islam. Muhammad had,\r\nhowever, also his panegyrists, the chief of whom was Ka'b bin Zoheir,\r\nthe composer of the celebrated Kasida called 'The Poem of the Mantle,'\r\nas a reward for which the Prophet threw his own cloak over him, under\r\nthe following circumstances, as related by Mr. J.W. Redhouse in the\r\npreface to his translation of the poem published in the 'Arabian\r\nPoetry for English Readers'[1] alluded to above.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: In this same work will also be found a\r\n    translation by Mr. Redhouse of another poem, also called\r\n    'The Poem of the Mantle,' but written by Sharaf-uddin\r\n    Muhammad Al-Busiri, who was born A.D. 1211, and died between\r\n    A.D. 1291 and 1300.]\r\n\r\nKa'b was a son of Zoheir, already mentioned as the author of one of\r\nthe pre-Islamite poems known as the 'Mua'llakat.' He had a brother\r\nnamed Bujeir, and, like their father, both brothers were good poets.\r\nBujeir was first converted, and embraced the faith of Islam. Ka'b was\r\nangry at this, and composed a lampoon on his brother, on the Prophet,\r\nand on their new religion. This he sent to his brother by the mouth of\r\na messenger. Bujeir repeated it to Muhammad, who commented on it as\r\nfavourable to the new faith and to himself, but at the same time\r\npassed a sentence of death on the satirist.\r\n\r\nBujeir well knew that his brother's life was in danger, and warned him\r\naccordingly, advising him at the same time to renounce his errors, and\r\ncome repentant to the Prophet, or to seek a safe asylum far away. Ka'b\r\nfound out that his life would really soon be taken, and set out\r\nsecretly for Madinah. There he found an old friend, claimed his\r\nprotection, and went with him next morning to the simple meeting-house\r\nwhere Muhammad and his chief followers performed their daily\r\ndevotions. When the service was ended, Ka'b approached Muhammad, and\r\nthe two sat down together. Ka'b placed his own right hand in that of\r\nthe Prophet, whom he addressed in these words: 'Apostle of God, were I\r\nto bring to you Ka'b, the son of Zoheir, penitent and professing the\r\nfaith of Islam, wouldst thou receive and accept him? The Prophet\r\nanswered, 'I would.' 'Then,' said the poet, 'I am he!'\r\n\r\nHearing this, the bystanders demanded permission to put him to death.\r\nMuhammad ordered his zealous followers to desist, and the poet then,\r\non the spur of the moment, recited a poem improvised at the time,\r\nprobably with more or less premeditation. It is said that when Ka'b\r\nreached the fifty-first verse: 'Verily the Apostle of God is a light\r\nfrom which illumination is sought--a drawn Indian blade, one of the\r\nswords of God,' Muhammad took from his own shoulders the mantle he\r\nwore, and threw it over the shoulders of the poet as an honour and as\r\na mark of protection. Hence the name given to the effusion, 'The Poem\r\nof the Mantle,' A.D. 630.\r\n\r\nMoawia, the first Khalif of the Omaiyides, endeavoured to purchase\r\nthis sacred mantle from Ka'b for ten thousand pieces of silver, but\r\nthe offer was refused. Later on it was, however, bought from Ka'b's\r\nheirs for twenty thousand pieces of silver, and it passed into the\r\nhands of the Khalifs, and was preserved by them as one of the regalia\r\nof the empire until Baghdad was sacked by the Mughals. The mantle, or\r\nwhat is supposed to be the self-same mantle, is now in the treasury[2]\r\nof the Sultan Khalif of the Ottomans at Constantinople, in an\r\napartment named 'The Room of the Sacred Mantle,' in which this robe is\r\nreligiously preserved, together with a few other relics of the great\r\nprophet.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 2: _Apropos_ of this treasury, it is much to be\r\n     regretted that a complete catalogue of its contents has\r\n     never been prepared along with a brief historical account of\r\n     them. It is difficult to obtain the order, which comes\r\n     direct from the Sultan, to visit the collection; and even\r\n     then visitors are hurried through at such a pace that it is\r\n     impossible to examine with minuteness the many curiosities\r\n     collected there.]\r\n\r\nKa'b has thus come to be considered as one of the friendly poets, and\r\nthe names of two others are also mentioned, viz., Abd-Allah bin Rewaha\r\nand Hassan bin Thabit. On the other hand, the most celebrated\r\nantagonists who attacked Muhammad, not only with their verses, but\r\nalso with their swords, were Abu Sofyan, Amr bin Al-'A'asi, and\r\nAbd-Allah bin Zobeir. These three became great political characters,\r\nbut later on made profession of Islam, and were the staunchest supporters\r\nof it, rendering the greatest services to the Prophet during his life,\r\nand to the cause after his death. But Muhammad's greatest triumph over\r\nthe poets was the conversion of Labid, who, after the perusal of the\r\ncommencement of the second Surah of the Koran, tore down his own poem,\r\nwhich was hung up in the Kaabah, and ran to the Prophet to announce\r\nhis conversion, and to make his profession of Islam. Even Ali, the\r\ncousin, son-in-law, and first convert of Muhammad, was a poet, but it\r\nis uncertain which of the Diwans attributed to him are genuine, and\r\nhow many of his maxims of wisdom, over a hundred in number, are his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nDuring the period under review the number of Arabic authors was\r\nlegion. Some idea of the number of writers, and of the subjects on\r\nwhich they wrote, can be gathered from the Fihrist of An-Nadim, from\r\nIbn Khallikan's Biographical Dictionary, and from Haji Khalfa's\r\nEncyclopædia. With such a mass of information as is contained in the\r\nabove-mentioned works, it is difficult to deal in a small work. To put\r\nthem together in an intelligible form, the idea of classing the\r\nauthors, according to the subjects on which they principally wrote,\r\nnaturally presented itself. This plan, therefore, has been followed,\r\nand a few details of the most celebrated writers will be given,\r\nclassified under the following heads:\r\n\r\n  Jurisconsults.\r\n  Imams and lawyers.\r\n  Traditionists.\r\n  Alchemists.\r\n  Astronomers.\r\n  Grammarians.\r\n  Geographers and travellers.\r\n  Historians.\r\n  Lexicographers, biographers and encyclopædists.\r\n  Writers on natural history.\r\n  Philologists.\r\n  Philosophers.\r\n  Physicians.\r\n  Poets.\r\n  Collectors and editors of poems.\r\n  Translators.\r\n  The Omaiyide Khalifs.\r\n  The Abbaside Khalifs.\r\n  The Spanish Khalifs.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the first century of the Hijrah (July,\r\n622--July, 719), the first persons of note in the Muhammadan world\r\nafter Muhammad and his immediate successors were probably the seven\r\njurisconsults, viz., Obaid Allah, Orwa, Kasim, Said, Sulaiman, Abu\r\nBakr and Kharija, who all lived at Madinah about the same time; and it\r\nwas from them, according to Ibn Khallikan, that the science of law and\r\nlegal decisions spread over the world. They were designated by the\r\nappellation of the Seven Jurisconsults, because the right of giving\r\ndecisions on points of law had passed to them from the companions of\r\nMuhammad, and they became publicly known as Muftis. These seven alone\r\nwere acknowledged as competent to give Fatmas, or legal decisions.\r\nThey died respectively A.D. 720, 712, 719, 710, 725, 712 and 718.\r\n\r\nThe jurisconsults were followed by the doctors of theology and law,\r\nor, as they were styled, Imams, or founders of the four orthodox\r\nsects. Now, among the Sunni Muslims an Imam may be described as a\r\nhigh-priest, or head, or chief in religious matters, whether he be the\r\nhead of all Muhammadans--as the Khalifah--or the priest of a mosque,\r\nor the leader in the prayers of a congregation. This title, however,\r\nis given by the Shias only to the immediate descendants of Ali, the\r\nson-in-law of the Prophet, and they are twelve in number, Ali being\r\nthe first. The last of them, Imam Mahdi, is supposed to be concealed\r\n(not dead), and the title which belongs to him cannot, they conceive,\r\nbe given to another.\r\n\r\nBut among the Sunnis it is a dogma that there must always be a visible\r\nImam or father of the Church. The title is given by them to the four\r\nlearned doctors who were the exponents of their faith, viz., Imams\r\nHanifa, Malik, Shafai and Hanbal. Of these, Imam Hanifa, the founder\r\nof the first of the four chief sects of the Sunnis, died A.D. 767. He\r\nwas followed by Imam Malik, Imam Shafai, and Imam Hanbal, the founders\r\nof the other three sects, who died A.D. 795, 820 and 855 respectively.\r\nFrom these four persons are derived the various codes of Muhammadan\r\njurisprudence. They have always been considered as the fundamental\r\npillars of the orthodox law, and have been esteemed by Mussulmans as\r\nhighly as the fathers of the Church--Gregory, Augustine, Jerome and\r\nChrysostom--have been appreciated by Christians.\r\n\r\nOf these four sects, the Hanbalite and Malikite may be considered as\r\nthe most rigid, the Shafaite as the most conformable to the spirit of\r\nIslamism, and the Hanifite as the wildest and most philosophical of\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the four Imams just mentioned, there was a fifth, of\r\nthe name of Abu Sulaiman Dawud az Zahari, who died A.D. 883. He was\r\nthe founder of the sect called Az-Zahariah (the External), and his\r\nlectures were attended by four hundred Fakihs (doctors of the civil\r\nand of the ecclesiastical law), who wore shawls thrown over their\r\nshoulders. But his opinions do not seem to have secured many\r\nfollowers, and in time both his ideas, and those of Sofyan at Thauri,\r\nanother chief of the orthodox sect, were totally abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe third century of the Hijrah (A.D. 816-913) is noted for the six\r\nfathers of tradition, viz., Al-Bukhari, Muslim, At Firmidi, Abu Dawud,\r\nAn-Nasai and Ibn Majah, with whom others, such as Kasim bin Asbagh,\r\nAbu Zaid, Al-Marwazi, Abu Awana and Al-Hazini, vied in great works on\r\ntradition, but these last-named could never acquire the authority of\r\nthe six previously mentioned, who died A.D. 870, 875, 892, 889, 916,\r\n887 respectively.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of Islam the great traditionists were Ayesha, the\r\nfavourite wife of the Prophet, the four rightly directed Khalifs,\r\nviz., Abu Bakr, Omar, Othman and Ali, and some of the companions[3]\r\nknown as the Evangelists of Islam. But besides these well-qualified\r\npersons who had lived with or near Muhammad during his lifetime, many\r\nothers who had perhaps only seen him or spoken to him claimed to be\r\nconsidered as companions, who handed down traditions; and when these\r\nwere all dead they were followed by others, who, having known the\r\ncompanions, were now designated as the successors of the companions.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 3: The names of these companions, and the kings,\r\n     princes, and countries to which they were sent by Muhammad,\r\n     are given in full detail in 'The Life of our Lord Muhammad,\r\n     the Apostle of God,' the author of which was Ibn Ishak; and\r\n     it was afterwards edited by Ibn Hisham. In the same work a\r\n     list is given of the disciples sent out by Jesus.]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it can easily be imagined that many of the\r\ntraditions were of doubtful authenticity. Al-Bukhari, whose collection\r\nof traditions of the Muhammadan religion holds the first place, both\r\nas regards authority and correctness, selected seven thousand two\r\nhundred and seventy-five of the most authentic out of ten thousand,\r\nall of which he regarded as being true, having rejected two hundred\r\nthousand as false. His book is held in the highest estimation, and\r\nconsidered both in spiritual and temporal matters as next in authority\r\nto the Koran. He was born A.D. 810, and died A.D. 870.\r\n\r\nThe Shiahs do not accept the collection of traditions as made by the\r\nSunnis, but have a collection of their own, upon which their system of\r\nlaw, both civil and religious, is founded.\r\n\r\nDuring the first and second centuries of the Hijrah (A.D. 622-816), of\r\nall the physical sciences alchemy was studied most. The greatest\r\nscientific man of the first century was undoubtedly Khalid, a prince\r\nof the Omaiyide dynasty, and the son of Yazid I. His zeal for\r\nknowledge and science induced him to get Greek and Syriac works\r\ntranslated by Stephanus into Arabic, especially those which treated on\r\nchemistry, or rather alchemy. Khalid, having been once reproached for\r\nwasting all his time in researches in the art of alchemy, replied: 'I\r\nhave occupied myself with these investigations to show my\r\ncontemporaries and brothers that I have found in them a recompense and\r\na reward for the Khalifate which I lost. I stand in need of no man to\r\nrecognise me at court, and I need not recognise anyone who dances\r\nattendance at the portals of dominion either from fear, ambition, or\r\ncovetousness.' He wrote a poem on alchemy, which bears the title of\r\n'Paradise of Wisdom,' and of him Ibn Khallikan says: 'He was the most\r\nlearned man of the tribe of Koraish in all the different branches of\r\nknowledge. He wrote a discourse on chemistry and on medicine, in which\r\nsciences he possessed great skill and solid information.' He died A.D.\r\n704.\r\n\r\nLater on Jaber bin Hayam, with his pupils, became a model for later\r\nalchemists, and he has been called the father of Arabian chemistry. He\r\ncompiled a work of two thousand pages, in which he inserted the\r\nproblems of his master, Jaafar as Sadik, considered to be the father\r\nof all the occult sciences in Islam. Jaber was such a prolific writer\r\nthat many of his five hundred works are said to bear his name only on\r\naccount of his celebrity, but to have been written in reality by a\r\nvariety of authors. His works on alchemy were published in Latin by\r\nGolius, under the title of 'Lapis Philosophorum,' and an English\r\ntranslation of them by Robert Russell appeared at Leyden in A.D. 1668.\r\nJaber died A.D. 766, and is not to be confounded with Al-Jaber\r\n(Geber), the astronomer, who lived at Seville about A.D. 1190, and\r\nconstructed there an astronomical observatory.\r\n\r\nAstronomy appears to have been always a favourite science with the\r\nArabs from the earliest times. In A.D. 772 there appeared at the court\r\nof the Khalif Mansur (A.D. 754-775), Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Habib al\r\nFezari, the astronomer, who brought with him the tables called Sind\r\nHind, in which the motions of the stars were calculated according to\r\ndegrees. They contained other observations on solar eclipses and the\r\nrising of the signs of the zodiac, extracted by him from the tables\r\nascribed to the Indian king, Figar. The Khalif Mansur ordered this\r\nbook to be translated into Arabic to serve as a guide for Arab\r\nastronomers. And these tables remained in use till the time of the\r\nKhalif Mamun (A.D. 813-833), when other revised ones bearing his name\r\ncame into vogue. These, again, were abridged by Abul Ma'shar\r\n(Albumasar, died A.D. 885-886), called the prince of Arabian\r\nastrologers, who, however, deviated from them, and inclined towards\r\nthe system of the Persians and of Ptolemy. This second revision was\r\nmore favourably received by the Arab astronomers than the first, and\r\nthe Sind Hind was superseded by the Almagest of Ptolemy. Better\r\nastronomical instruments also came into use, though previously the\r\nAl-Fezari above mentioned had been the first in Islam who constructed\r\nastrolabes of various kinds, and had written several astronomical\r\ntreatises.\r\n\r\nMention might be made of about forty mathematicians and astronomers\r\nwho wrote books on these subjects. The best of them, such as\r\nAl-Farghani (Alfraganius) and others, lived at the court of Mamun, who\r\nbuilt an astronomical observatory in Baghdad and another near\r\nDamascus, on Mount Kasiun. He caused also two degrees of the meridian\r\nto be measured on the plain of Sinjar, so as to ascertain the\r\ncircumference of the earth with more precision. In A.D. 824 there were\r\nheld philosophical disputations in his presence. Al-Farghani was the\r\nauthor of an introduction to astronomy, which was printed by Golius at\r\nAmsterdam in 1669, with notes.\r\n\r\nBetween the years A.D. 877 and 929 there flourished the famous\r\ncalculator and astronomer, Muhammad bin Jaber al Battani, Latinized as\r\nAlbategnius. He was the author of the astronomical work entitled 'The\r\nSabæan Tables,' and adopted nearly the system and the hypothesis of\r\nPtolemy, but rectified them in several points, and made other\r\ndiscoveries, which procured him a distinguished place among the\r\nscholars whose labours have enriched astronomical science. Al-Battani\r\napproached much nearer to the truth than the ancients as far as the\r\nmovements of the fixed stars are concerned. He measured the greatness\r\nof the eccentricity of the solar orbit, and a more correct result\r\ncannot be obtained. To the work containing all his discoveries he gave\r\nthe name of 'As-Zij-as Sabi,' which was translated into Latin under\r\nthe title 'De Scientiâ Stellarum.' The first edition of it appeared at\r\nNuremberg in A.D. 1537, but it is believed that the original work is\r\nin the library of the Vatican. He was classed by Lalande among the\r\nforty-two most celebrated astronomers of the world. He died A.D.\r\n929-930.\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated astronomer, Ali bin Yunis, was a native of Egypt,\r\nand appears to have lived at the court of the demented tyrant of\r\nEgypt, Al-Hakim bramrillah, and under his patronage to have composed\r\nthe celebrated astronomical tables called, after his name, 'The\r\nHakimite Tables.' Ibn Khallikan states that he had seen these tables\r\nin four volumes, and that more extensive ones had not come under his\r\nnotice. These tables were considered in Egypt to be of equal value to\r\nthose of the astronomer Yabya bin Ali Mansur, who had in A.D. 830, by\r\norder of the Khalif Mamun, undertaken astronomical observations both\r\nat Baghdad and Damascus. Ibn Yunis spent his life in the preparation\r\nof astronomical tables and in casting horoscopes, for it must be\r\nremembered that with the Muslims astronomy and astrology were\r\nsynonymous, and their most learned astronomers were also their most\r\nskilful astrologers. His character for honesty was highly esteemed,\r\nand he was also well versed in other sciences, and displayed an\r\neminent talent for poetry. He died A.D. 1009, and is not to be\r\nconfounded with his father, Ibn Yunis, the historian, who died A.D.\r\n958.\r\n\r\nYet another name must be mentioned, viz., the Spanish-Arab astronomer\r\nIbn Abd-ar-Rahman Es-Zerkel, Europeanized as Arzachal. He first\r\nresided at Toledo, at the court of its sovereign, Mamun, for whom he\r\nmade an astrolabe, which he called in his honour the Mamunian. He then\r\nwent to Seville, where he wrote for Motamid bin Abbad (A.D. 1069-1091)\r\na treatise on the use of certain instruments. During his residence at\r\nToledo he constructed two clepsydras, the waters of which decreased\r\nand increased according to the waning and growing of the moon, and\r\nthese two basins were destroyed only in A.D. 1133 by Alphonse VI.,\r\nwhen he took Toledo. Arzachal left a work on eclipses, and on the\r\nrevolution of years, as well as the tables of the sky, to which the\r\nname of Toledan tables have been given. His writings, but especially\r\nthe last, which must have been consulted by the editors of the\r\nAlphonsine tables, were never translated, and exist only in manuscript\r\nin libraries where but few scholars can consult them. Arzachal made\r\nmany observations in connection with the sun, and was also the\r\ninventor of the astronomical instrument called after his name,\r\nZerkalla. He died A.D. 1080.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject it may be mentioned that Makkari, in his\r\ngreat encyclopædia of Spain, enumerates fifteen astronomers of\r\nAndalusia, all more or less known in their time. Also that\r\nBedei-ul-Astrolabi and Ibn Abdul-Rayman distinguished themselves as\r\nmakers of astronomical instruments, and inventors of new ones. While\r\nArzachal was the greatest representative of Arab astronomy in the West,\r\nUmar Khayam, the astronomer, mathematician, freethinker, and poet, was\r\nits greatest representative in the East, in Persia, where he died A.D.\r\n1123.\r\n\r\nA great deal in Arabic literature has been written about grammar, and,\r\nuntil its principles were finally laid down and established, it was\r\nalways a source of continual controversy between different professors\r\nand different schools. Abul Aswad ad-Duwali has been called the father\r\nof Arabic grammar. It is said that the Khalif Ali laid down for him\r\nthis principle: the parts of speech are three, the noun, the verb, and\r\nthe particle, and told him to form a complete treatise upon it. This\r\nwas accordingly done; and other works on the subject were also\r\nproduced, but none of them are apparently now extant. Muhammad bin\r\nIshak has stated that he saw one of them, entitled 'Discourse on the\r\nGoverning and the Governed Parts of Speech;' and the author of the\r\n'Fihrist' also alludes to this work. Abul-Aswad died at Busra in A.D.\r\n688, aged eighty-five, but some years later his two successors in this\r\nbranch of literature (viz., Al-Khalil and Sibawaih) far surpassed him\r\nin every way.\r\n\r\nAl-Khalil bin Ahmad, born A.D. 718, was one of the great masters in\r\nthe science of grammar, and the discoverer of the rules of prosody,\r\nwhich art owes to him its creation. He laid the foundation of the\r\nlanguage by his book 'Al-Ain' (so called from the letter with which it\r\nbegins), and by the aid he afforded thereby to Sibawaih, whose master\r\nhe was, in the composition of his celebrated grammatical work known by\r\nthe name of 'The Book.' In the work called 'Al-Ain,' Khalil first\r\narranged the stock of Arabic words, dealing with the organ of speech\r\nand the production of sounds, and then dividing the words into\r\nclasses, the roots of which consisted of one, two, three, four, or\r\nfive letters. It is still a matter of dispute whether the book\r\n'Al-Ain' was wholly composed by Khalil himself, or completed in course\r\nof time by his pupils. A copy of this celebrated lexicon and work on\r\nphilology is in the Escurial Library. Khalil also wrote a treatise on\r\nprosody, and other works on grammar, and a book on musical intonation.\r\nHe died A.D. 786, at Busra. 'Poverty,' he said, 'consists not in the\r\nwant of money, but of soul; and riches are in the mind, not in the\r\npurse.'\r\n\r\nSibawaih, the pupil of Khalil, has been called the father of Arabic\r\nlexicography, and the lawgiver of Arabic grammar. Ibn Khallikan says\r\nthat he was a learned grammarian, and surpassed in this science every\r\nperson of former and later times. As for his 'Kitab,' or 'Book,'\r\ncomposed by him on that subject, it has never had its equal. The great\r\nphilologist and grammarian, Al-Jahiz, said of the book of Sibawaih,\r\nthat none like it had ever been written on grammar, and that all\r\nwriters on this subject who had succeeded him had borrowed from it.\r\nWhen Al-Kisai was tutor to the prince Al-Amin, son of Harun-ar-Rashid,\r\nSibawaih came to Baghdad, and the two great grammarians (Sibawaih, the\r\nchief of the school of Busra, and Al-Kisai, chief of the school of\r\nKufa) had a long dispute about a certain expression of Arabic speech,\r\nand an Arab of the desert was called in to arbitrate between them. The\r\nman first decided in favour of Sibawaih, but when the question was put\r\nin another form, the Bedouin asserted that Kisai was right. As\r\nSibawaih considered that he had been unjustly treated in the matter,\r\nhe left Baghdad for good. The year of his death has been given\r\ndifferently by various authors, the earliest date being A.D. 787, and\r\nthe latest A.D. 809.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated grammarians of the third century of the Hijrah\r\n(A.D. 816-913) were Al-Mubarrad, who died A.D. 898, and Thalab, who\r\ndied A.D. 903. They were also great antagonists to each other.\r\nAl-Mubarrad, the author of thirty works, was the chief of the school of\r\nBusra, and Thalab of that of Kufa, both founded during the preceding\r\ncentury by Sibawaih and Kisai. Thalab was the first collector of books\r\nin Islam, and those left by him were very valuable.\r\n\r\nMention must also be made of Al-Farra, the grammarian, and\r\ndistinguished by his knowledge of grammar, philology, and various\r\nbranches of literature. He died A.D. 822, at the age of sixty-three,\r\nand preceded both Mubarrad and Thalab, the latter of whom used to say:\r\n'Were it not for Al-Farra, pure Arabic would no longer exist; it was\r\nhe who disengaged it from the ordinary language and fixed it by\r\nwriting.' At the request of the Khalif Al-Mamun he drew up in two\r\nyears a most elaborate work, which contained the principles of\r\ngrammar, and all the pure Arabic expressions which he had heard. It\r\nwas entitled 'Al-Hudûd' (the Limits or Chapters), and directly it was\r\nfinished he commenced another in connection with the Koran, which is\r\nspoken of as a most wonderful production. He wrote besides several\r\nother works on grammar, and acted as tutor to the two sons of the\r\nKhalif Mamun.\r\n\r\nThough many other grammarians could be named, such as Al-Akhfash al\r\nAusat, Abu Amr as Shaibani, Abu Bakr al Anbari, etc., none can be\r\nconsidered so celebrated as the persons above mentioned, who are\r\nregarded as the founders of the principles on which Arabic grammar has\r\nbeen established.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the third century of the Hijrah (A.D. 816-913), the\r\nArabs first began to distinguish themselves as travellers and\r\ngeographers. When Muslim Homeir was, in A.D. 845, ransomed from his\r\ncaptivity among the Byzantines and returned to his country, he wrote a\r\nbook with the title of 'Admonitions on the Countries, Kings and\r\nOffices of the Greeks.' Forty years afterwards Jaafar bin Ahmed al\r\nMervezi produced the first geographical work under the title of\r\n'Highways and Countries,' which was followed by those of Ibn Foslan,\r\nIbn Khordabeh, Jeihani, Al-Istakhri, Ibn Haukul, Al-Beruni, Al-Bekri\r\nand Idrisi. The great historian, Masudi, was also a writer of travels\r\nand an ambassador. Ibn Foslan was sent by the Khalif Muktadir (A.D.\r\n908-932) to the King of the Bulgarians. Abu Dolaf, who accompanied an\r\nambassador from China to the frontiers of that country, made, on his\r\nreturn, a report which Yakut afterwards embodied in his voluminous\r\ngeographical Dictionary.\r\n\r\nA few details will be given about the six chief geographers and\r\ntravellers of this period, viz., Ibn Khordabeh, Al-Istakhri, Ibn\r\nHaukul, Al-Beruni, Al-Bekri and Idrisi.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first-named, it would appear that he has been the\r\nobject of considerable controversies among the Orientalists of Europe.\r\nAfter employment in the post and intelligence departments in the\r\nprovinces, he subsequently came to the court of the Khalif Motamid\r\n(A.D. 870-892), and became one of his privy councillors. He is the\r\nauthor of several works on various subjects, but his 'Geography,' says\r\nSir H.M. Elliot, is the only work we possess of this author, and of\r\nthis there is only one copy in Europe, in the Bodleian Library at\r\nOxford. He died about A.D. 912.\r\n\r\nAl-Istakhri, who flourished about the year A.D. 951, obtained his name\r\nfrom Istakhar (_i.e._, Persepolis), where he was born. He was a\r\ntraveller whose geographical work has been translated into German by\r\nMordtmann. When Istakhari was in the Indus Valley he met another\r\ncelebrated traveller, Ibn Haukul, whose book Sir William Ouseley\r\ntranslated in A.D. 1800 into English, under the title of 'The Oriental\r\nGeography of Ibn Haukul.' Haukul, who died A.D. 976, had travelled for\r\nnearly twenty-eight years in the countries of Islam with the works of\r\nIbn Khordabeh and Jeihani in his hands, and his work, which bears the\r\ngenerally approved title of 'Highways and Countries,' is based on the\r\nbook of Istakhri.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest geographer and naturalist of this period is Abu\r\nRaihan Al-Beruni (born about A.D. 971), who accompanied Mahmud the\r\nGhaznavide on his invasions to India. He was to Mahmud of Ghazni what\r\nAristotle was to Alexander, with the difference, however, that he\r\nactually accompanied the conqueror on his Indian campaigns. He\r\ntravelled into different countries and to and from India for the space\r\nof forty years, and during that time was much occupied with astronomy\r\nand astronomical observations, as well as geography. His works are\r\nsaid to have exceeded a camel-load, but the most valuable of all of\r\nthem is his description of India. It gives an account of the religion\r\nof India, its philosophy, literature, geography, chronology,\r\nastronomy, customs, law and astrology about a.d. 1030, and has been\r\nedited by Edward Sachau, Professor in the Royal University of Berlin.\r\nAn English edition, containing a preface, the translation of the\r\nArabic text, notes and indices, has also been published. Al-Beruni\r\ndied at Ghurna A.D. 1038. He used to correspond with Avicenna, who was\r\nhis contemporary, and who gives in his works the answers to the\r\nquestions addressed to him by this famous geographer, astronomer,\r\ngeometrician, historian, scholar, and logician.\r\n\r\nSome years later Abu O'beid Abd-Allah Al-Bekri distinguished himself\r\nas one of the greatest geographers, with whose labours Quatremere and\r\nDozy and Gayangos have made us better acquainted. He was, by birth,\r\nfrom Andalusia, whence also many others travelled to the East, either\r\nfor instruction or for trade or as pilgrims, and of whom about a\r\ncouple of dozen are mentioned by Makkari. Some of these gave\r\ndescriptions and topographies, to which class of literature also the\r\npoetical laudations of celebrated towns belong. Not only Baghdad,\r\nDamascus, Cairo, Fez, Morocco and Khairwan were praised or satirized,\r\nbut also Cordova, Seville, Granada, Malaga, Toledo, Valencia and Zohra\r\nwere described in Arabic poems. Al-Bekri died in A.D. 1094-1095, and\r\nwas followed by Idrisi, the author of a work on Arabian geography of\r\nsome celebrity, and which has been translated into Latin. He died A.D.\r\n1164.\r\n\r\nOf historians in Arab literature there are many, but only the most\r\ncelebrated will be noted. Muhammad bin Ishak, who died about A.D. 767,\r\nproduced the best and most trustworthy biography of the prophet\r\nMuhammad. His work was published under the patronage of the Abbaside\r\nprinces, and was, in fact, composed for the Khalif Al-Mansur (A.D.\r\n754-775). It was used as the chief source of information by Ibn\r\nHisham, the next historian of note, in his life of the Prophet, which\r\nwork has been edited by Dr. Wustenfeld, and translated into German by\r\nDr. Weil, and into English by Mr. E. Rehatsek, whose manuscript,\r\nhowever, has not yet been printed. Ibn Hisham, who died in A.D. 828,\r\nwas the father of Arabic genealogy, and Abu-el-Siyadi, who died in\r\nA.D. 857, is next to him.\r\n\r\nBut the real father of Arabian history was Al-Wackidi, a good and\r\ntrustworthy historian, thirty-two of whose works are known, all\r\nrelating to the conquests of the Arabs, and other such subjects. He\r\ndied A.D. 822. With him generally has been associated his secretary,\r\nMuhammad bin Saad, a man of unimpeachable integrity, and of the\r\nhighest talents, merit, and eminence. He has left us some most\r\ninteresting works, full of valuable information relating to those\r\ntimes. He died at Baghdad A.D. 844.\r\n\r\nAl-Madaini, who died A.D. 839, was the author of two hundred and fifty\r\nhistorical works, of which, however, nothing has yet been discovered,\r\nexcept their titles as given in the 'Fihrist.'\r\n\r\nPassing over many other historians, two more only will be mentioned,\r\nviz., Abu Jafir at-Tabari and Al-Masúdi.\r\n\r\nTabari (whose annals are now being edited by a company of European\r\nOrientalists) was born A.D. 838, at Amol, in the province of\r\nTabaristan. He travelled a great deal, and composed many works on\r\nhistory, poetry, grammar and lexicography. His work on jurisprudence\r\nextends to several volumes, and his historical works stamp him as one\r\nof the most reliable of Arab historians, while his numerous other\r\nworks also bear witness to the variety and accuracy of his\r\nacquirements. He died at Baghdad A.D. 923, and has been called by\r\nGibbon the Livy of the Arabians.\r\n\r\nAl-Masúdi, a contemporary of the great historian Tabari, died\r\nthirty-four years after him, in A.D. 957. His great work, 'Meadows of\r\nGold and Mines of Gems,' with the Arabic text above and a French\r\ntranslation below, has been published in nine volumes (1861-1877) by\r\nBarbier de Meynard, in connection with Pavet de Courteille, at the\r\nexpense of the French Government. Dr. A. Sprenger (who translated one\r\nvolume of the work into English for the Oriental Translation Fund,\r\nLondon, 1841) calls the author of it the Herodotus of Arabian history,\r\nbecause he had, like his Greek prototype, undertaken extensive\r\ntravels, and had like him made the description of countries and\r\nnations his chief occupation. The titles of ten of his works are known\r\nto us, but the principal one is that named above, in the composition\r\nof which he used eighty-five historical, geographical, and\r\nphilological works, as he himself informs us in the first chapter of\r\nhis history. The work itself contains one hundred and thirty-two\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nIbn al Athir al Jazari, born A.D. 1160 and died A.D. 1233, was also an\r\nhistorian of note, and a personal friend of Ibn Khallikan, who writes\r\nof him as follows: 'His knowledge of the Traditions, and his\r\nacquaintance with that science in its various branches, placed him in\r\nthe first rank; and his learning as an historian of the ancients and\r\nmoderns was not less extensive; he was perfectly familiar with the\r\ngenealogy of the Arabs, their adventures, combats and history; whilst\r\nhis great work, \"The Kâmil or Complete,\" embracing the history of the\r\nworld from the earliest period to the year 628 of the Hijrah (A.D.\r\n1230-1231), merits its reputation as one of the best productions of\r\nthe kind.' Another of Ibn Al Athir's works is the history of the most\r\neminent among the companions of Muhammad, in the shape of a\r\nbiographical dictionary.\r\n\r\nAs the development of Arab letters proceeded, in the course of time\r\nvarious authors began to tabulate the different branches of knowledge\r\nand science, and these, with the biographies of many of the writers,\r\nand the lists of their works, formed a distinct branch in the\r\nliterature of that day.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy of them all was Abul Faraj Muhammad bin Ishak, who\r\nis generally known by the name of Ibn Ali Yakub al Warrak the copyist,\r\nsurnamed An-Nadim al Baghdadi, the social companion from Baghdad, and\r\nthe author of the 'Fihrist.' It may be truly said that this writer,\r\nalong with Ibn Khallikan, laid the foundations of the records of the\r\nedifice of encyclopædical and biographical works, which was afterwards\r\ncompleted by Haji Khalfa and Abul Khair. Without the work of Ibn\r\nKhallikan it would be as impossible to give a history of Arab\r\nscholars, as without the work of An-Nadim to give an account of Arab\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe 'Kitab al-Fihrist' was written by An-Nadim in A.D. 987, and is\r\ndivided into ten sections, dealing with every branch of letters and\r\nlearning. It gives the names of many authors and their works long\r\nsince extant, and shows the enormous amount of writings produced by\r\nthe Arabs during the periods under review, up to A.D. 987, the date of\r\nthe author's work. A short account of this ancient and curious book\r\nhas been given in the _Journal Asiatique_ for December, 1839, and\r\nfrom the work itself Von Hammer Purgstall has been able to gather that\r\nthe 'Thousand and One Nights' ('Arabian Nights') had a Persian origin.\r\nIn the eighth section of the 'Fihrist' the author says that the first\r\nwho composed tales and apologues were the kings of the early Persian\r\ndynasties, and that these tales were augmented and amplified by the\r\nSasanians (A.D. 228-641). The Arabs then translated them into their\r\nown language, and composed other stories like them.\r\n\r\nIbn Khallikan, the most worthy of biographers, must also be mentioned\r\nhere, though he died in A.D. 1282, twenty-four years after the fall of\r\nBaghdad, having been born in A.D. 1211. This very eminent scholar and\r\nfollower of Shafa'i doctrines, was born at Arbela, but resided at\r\nDamascus, where he had filled the place of Chief Kadi till the year\r\nA.D. 1281, when he was dismissed, and from that time to the day of his\r\ndeath he never went out of doors. He was a man with the greatest\r\nreputation for learning, versed in various sciences, and highly\r\naccomplished. He was a scholar, a poet, a compiler, a biographer and\r\nan historian. By his talents and writings he merited the honourable\r\ntitle of the most learned man and the ablest historian. His celebrated\r\nbiographical work, called the 'Wafiat-ul-Aiyan,' or Deaths of Eminent\r\nMen, is the acme of perfection. This work was translated from the\r\nArabic by Baron MacGuckin de Slane, a member of the council of the\r\nAsiatic Society of Paris, and printed by the Oriental Translation Fund\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland in A.D. 1842, 1843, 1868 and 1871. For\r\nall those who wish to gain a knowledge of the legal literature of the\r\nMuhammadans it is a most valuable work, as the Baron has added to the\r\ntext numerous learned notes, replete with curious and interesting\r\ninformation relating to the Muhammadan law and lawyers. Ibn Khallikan\r\ndied, aged seventy-three lunar years, in the Najibia College at\r\nDamascus, and was buried in the cemetery of As-Salihiya, a well-known\r\nvillage situated on the declivity of Mount Kasiun, a short distance to\r\nthe north of Damascus, and from which a splendid view of the town and\r\nits surrounding gardens is obtained. When lately there I made\r\ninquiries about the tomb of this great Arab _littérateur_, but\r\nwithout success. His tomb has quite disappeared, and his name seemed\r\nto be forgotten; but his work still lives, an everlasting monument of\r\nhis industry and his intelligence.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the early Arab poets described men, women,\r\nanimals, and their surroundings in their effusive Kasidas before\r\nprose-writing was established. Later on grammarians and philologists\r\nbegan to write books on the different objects of nature and on the\r\nphysiology of man; also treatises on the horse, the camel, bees,\r\nmountains, seas, rivers, and all natural phenomena. There were thus\r\nlaid down, though not a scientific, at least a philological basis, for\r\nthe future development of the natural sciences and geography. Such\r\nmonographs were only in later times collected in encyclopaedic works,\r\nin which they were inserted in such a manner as to constitute various\r\nchapters only, and no longer separate treatises.\r\n\r\nKhalef-al-Ahmer (whom Suyuti declared to be a great forger, because he\r\npretended that some poems written by himself had been composed by\r\nancient Arab poets) wrote the first book on Arab mountains, and about\r\nthe poems recited concerning them. Ahmed bin-ud Dinveri wrote, in\r\naddition to several grammatical and mathematical works, a book on\r\nplants, and after him the grammarian Al-Jahiz wrote the first treatise\r\non animals, but more from a philological point of view than from that\r\nof natural history. He wrote, moreover, on theology, geography,\r\nnatural history, and philology; but his most celebrated work is his\r\n'Book of Animals,' in which he displayed all his knowledge of the\r\nArabic tongue. He was frightfully ugly, and obtained the surname of\r\nJahiz on account of his protuberant eyes. He himself informs us that\r\nthe Khalif Mutwakkil intended to appoint him as tutor to his sons, but\r\nwas deterred by his ugliness, and dismissed him with a present of ten\r\nthousand dirhems. Al-Jahiz died A.D. 869, over ninety years of age.\r\n\r\nPhilology is a term now generally used as applicable to that science\r\nwhich embraces human language in its widest extent, and may be shortly\r\ncalled 'the science of language.' But in earlier times philology\r\nincluded, with few exceptions, everything that could be learned--many\r\nand various subjects, without particular reference to the meaning now\r\ngenerally adopted concerning it.\r\n\r\nThere will be found among the Arab authors of this period many\r\nphilologists who also wrote upon other matters, but have been recorded\r\nhere as having particularly excelled in this particular branch of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nAl Kasim bin Ma'an was the first who wrote on the rarities of the\r\nlanguage and on the peculiarities of authors, and, according to the\r\n'Fihrist,' he surpassed all his contemporaries by the variety of his\r\ninformation. Tradition and traditionists, poetry and poets, history\r\nand historians, scholastic theology and theologians, genealogy and\r\ngenealogists, were the subjects on which he displayed the extent of\r\nhis acquirements. He died A.D. 791.\r\n\r\nAbu Ali Muhammad bin-al Mustanir bin Ahmad, generally known by the\r\nname of Kutrub, was also a grammarian and philologist, and wrote books\r\nand treatises on these subjects, as also on natural history. He died\r\nA.D. 821.\r\n\r\nPhilology and Arabic poetry were the special objects of the studies of\r\nAbu Amr Ishak bin Mirar as Shaibani, and in these two branches of\r\nknowledge his authority is of the highest order. He composed a number\r\nof works and treatises, and wrote with his own hand upwards of eighty\r\nvolumes. He died A.D. 825.\r\n\r\nBut the two earliest, and perhaps the two most celebrated,\r\nphilologists were Al-Asmai and Abu Obaida, who outshone their\r\nsuccessors for all time to come, and were distinguished--the former by\r\nhis wit, and the latter by his scholarship.\r\n\r\nAbu Said Abd-al Malik bin Kuraib al-Asmai was born A.D. 739 or 740,\r\nand died A.D. 831. He was a complete master of the Arabic language, an\r\nable grammarian, and the most eminent of all those who transmitted\r\norally historical narrations, anecdotes, stories, and rare expressions\r\nof the language. When the poet Abu Nuwas was informed that Asmai and\r\nAbu Obaida had been introduced at Harun's court, he said that the\r\nlatter would narrate ancient and modern history, but that the former\r\nwould charm with his melodies. Ibn Shabba was informed by Asmai\r\nhimself 'that he knew by heart sixteen thousand pieces of verse\r\ncomposed in the measure called Rajaz, or free metre,' and Ishak al\r\nMausili asserted 'that he never heard al-Asmai profess to know a\r\nbranch of science without discovering that none knew it better than\r\nhe.' No one ever explained better than Al-Asmai the idioms of the\r\ndesert Arabs. Most of his works, which amount to thirty-six, treat of\r\nthe language and its grammar; but he also wrote a book on the horse\r\nand different treatises on various other animals, such as the camel,\r\nthe sheep, wild beasts, etc., and their physiology.\r\n\r\nAl-Asmai's contemporary, Abu Obaida, was an able grammarian and an\r\naccomplished scholar. He was born A.D. 728, and died at Busra A.D.\r\n824, leaving nearly two hundred treatises, of which the names of many\r\nhave been given by Ibn Khallikan, and most of them are of a purely\r\nphilological character. There are many anecdotes about him, and many\r\nsayings of clever men regarding him. Abu Nuwas took lessons from Abu\r\nObaida, praised him highly, and decried Al-Asmai, whom he detested.\r\nWhen asked what he thought of Al-Asmai, he replied, 'A nightingale in\r\na cage,' meaning probably that a nightingale in a cage is pleasing to\r\nhear, but there is nothing else good about it. Abu Obaida he described\r\nas 'a bundle of science packed up in a skin.'\r\n\r\nAbu Zaid al-Ansari was a philologist and grammarian, and a\r\ncontemporary of the two persons just described. He held the first rank\r\namong the literary men of that time, and devoted his attention\r\nprincipally to the study of the philology of the Arabic language, its\r\nsingular terms and rare expressions. Of him Al-Mubarrad said: 'Abu\r\nZaid was an abler grammarian than Al-Asmai and Abu Obaida, but these\r\ntwo came next to him, and were near to each other. Abu Obaida was the\r\nmost accomplished scholar of the day.' Abu Zaid composed a number of\r\nuseful philological works, and titles of thirty-one of them are given\r\nin the 'Fihrist.' He died A.D. 830, over ninety years of age.\r\n\r\nAbu Othman Bakr bin Muhammad bin Habib al-Mayini, briefly called Abu\r\nOthman, was celebrated as a philologer and grammarian, as also for his\r\nknowledge in general literature. He learned philology from Abu Zaid,\r\nAbu Obaida, Al-Asmai, and others, and had for pupil Al-Mubarrad, who\r\nlearned much from his master, and handed down many pieces of\r\ntraditional literature obtained from him. Abu Othman, once being asked\r\nhis opinion about various men of science, curtly summarized them as\r\nfollows: 'The Koran-readers are deceitful administrators, the\r\ntraditionists are satisfied with superfluities, poets are too\r\nsuperficial, grammarians much too heavy, narrators deal only in neat\r\nexpressions, and the only real science is jurisprudence,' He died A.D.\r\n863.\r\n\r\nAbul Aina was a philologist, but also a great joker, anecdote-teller,\r\nand poet. His memory was equal to his eloquence, and, being\r\nquick-witted, he was never in want of a repartee when the occasion\r\nrequired it; indeed, he ranked among the most brilliant wits of the\r\nage. To a vizier, who said that everything current about the liberality\r\nof the Barmekides was only so much exaggeration and invention of\r\nleaf-scribblers, he replied: 'Of you, O vizier, the leaf-scribblers\r\nwill certainly report nothing and invent nothing.' There are many other\r\nanecdotes and stories told about him. Being asked how long he would\r\ncontinue to praise some and satirize others, he replied: 'As long as\r\nthe virtuous do good and the wicked do evil, but God forbid that I\r\nshould be as the scorpion which stingeth equally the prophet and the\r\ninfidel.' He had a most wonderful memory, which he applied, however,\r\nnot to the preservation of interpretations and their vouchers, but to\r\nthat of anecdotes, drolleries, and witty sayings, wherefore his name\r\nhas been perpetuated as that of a joker. He died A.D. 896.\r\n\r\nMention must also be made of Abdullah bin Muslim bin Kutaiba, who was\r\na philologist and grammarian of eminent talent, and noted for the\r\ncorrectness of his information. He was the author of many works, such\r\nas 'The Book of Facts,' 'The Writer's Guide,' 'Notices on the Poets,'\r\nand 'A Treatise on Horses,' and others, all of which were more or less\r\ncelebrated in their time. He was born A.D. 828, and died, some say, in\r\nA.D. 884, others in A.D. 908.\r\n\r\nIbn Duraid, whose many other names are given by Ibn Khallikan, is\r\ndescribed by that author as 'the most accomplished scholar, the ablest\r\nphilologer, and the first poet of the age.' Masudi and other men of\r\nlearning also speak of him in the highest terms. He composed several\r\nworks on natural history, and produced also a complete Dictionary of\r\nthis kind, after the model of the books 'Al-A'in' and 'Al-Jim,' the\r\ntwo letters of the alphabet with which Khalil, the grammarian, and Abu\r\nAmr as Shaibani respectively began their works. Ibn Duraid died at\r\nBaghdad A.D. 933. The celebrated Motazelite divine Abu Haslim Abd-as\r\nSalam Al-Jubbai died the same day, and this caused the people to say\r\nthat 'To-day philology and dogmatic theology have ceased to exist.'\r\n\r\nIn the East, by philosophy not only logic and metaphysics are meant,\r\nbut also all ethical, political, mathematical, and medical sciences.\r\nIndeed, it may be said that nearly all learned men were in those days\r\ncalled philosophers, a term which included mathematicians,\r\nastronomers, physicians, encyclopædists and others.\r\n\r\nFrom the mass of Arab authors all laying claim to the title of\r\nphilosopher, it is perhaps an invidious task to select a few only, and\r\neven those selected by one person might be rejected by another. But\r\npublic opinion will probably agree in naming three persons as having\r\nclaim to the highest rank in Arab learning. They are Al-Kindi,\r\nAl-Farabi, and Ali-ibn Sina, commonly called Avicenna. Ali-bin Ridhwan,\r\nAl-Ghazali, Ibn Bajah (Avempace), and Ibn Rashid (Averroes) have also\r\ntheir claims to be considered, while Thalab bin Korra, Kosta bin Luka,\r\nAl-Tavhidi, and Al-Majridi were also all eminent men. A few details\r\nwill be given about the first seven of the names just mentioned.\r\n\r\nYakub-bin Ishak Al-Kindi, the philosopher of the Arabs, known in\r\nEurope by the corrupted name of Alchendius, possessed an encyclopædic\r\nmind, and being himself a living encyclopædia, he composed one of all\r\nthe sciences. He divided philosophy into three branches, the\r\nmathematical, the physical, and the ethical. He declared the nullity\r\nof alchemy, which Ibn Sina had again brought to honourable notice,\r\ntill the physician Abdul Latif declaimed against it. But Al-Kindi was\r\nnot sufficiently advanced to write against astrology, which is still\r\nin full force all over the East even in our own times. Only one of his\r\nworks has as yet been published in Europe, and that treats on the\r\ncomposition of medicines, though we possess the titles of not less\r\nthan two hundred and thirty-four works composed by him on a variety of\r\nsubjects. He died A.D. 861.\r\n\r\nAbu Nasr Al-Farabi (Alfarabius), called by the Arabs a second\r\nAristotle, is generally considered to be the second Arab philosopher;\r\nAvicenna, who always quotes him in his works, the third; the first\r\nplace being assigned to Al-Kindi. Al-Farabi studied Arabic (he was a\r\nTurk by birth) and philosophy in Baghdad, where he attended the\r\nlectures of Abu Bishr Matta bin Yunus, who possessed, and also\r\nimparted to his pupils, the gift of expressing the deepest meanings in\r\nthe easiest words. From Baghdad he went to Harran, where Yuhanna bin\r\nKhailan, the Christian philosopher, was teaching logic, and after his\r\nreturn he made all the works of Aristotle his special study. It is\r\nrelated that the following note was found inscribed in Al-Farabi's\r\nhandwriting on a copy of Aristotle's treatise on the soul: 'I have\r\nread over this book two hundred times.' He also said that he had read\r\nover Aristotle's 'Physics' forty times, and felt that he ought to read\r\nit over again. Abul Kasim Said, of Cordova, says in his 'Classes of\r\nPhilosophers' that 'Al-Farabi led all the professors of Islam to the\r\nright understanding of logic by unveiling and explaining its secrets,\r\nas well as by considering all those points which Al-Kindi had\r\nneglected, and by teaching the application of analogy to all occurring\r\ncases.' In his enumeration and limitation of the sciences, Al-Farabi\r\nembraced the whole system of knowledge as it then existed. He went to\r\nEgypt, and afterwards to Damascus, where he died in A.D. 950. During\r\nhis residence at Damascus he was mostly to be found near the borders\r\nof some rivulet, or in a shady garden; there he composed his works and\r\nreceived the visits of his pupils. He was extremely abstemious, and\r\nentirely indifferent to wealth and poverty. The list of his works on\r\nphilosophical and scientific subjects amount to sixty-one. Mr. Munk's\r\n'Mélanges de Philosophie Juive et Arabe' (Paris, 1859) contains good\r\narticles on Al-Farabi and Al-Kindi.\r\n\r\nIbn Sina (Avicenna) was a great philosopher and physician. At the age\r\nof ten years he had completed the study of the Koran in Bukhara, where\r\nafterwards a certain Natili became his tutor, with whom he first\r\nstudied the 'Eisagoge' of Porphyry, and afterwards Euclid, and lastly\r\nthe 'Almagest' of Ptolemy. Natili then departed, and an ardent desire\r\nto study medicine having taken possession of Ibn Sina, he commenced to\r\nread medical books, which not being so difficult to understand as\r\nmathematics and metaphysics, he made such rapid progress in them that\r\nhe soon became an excellent physician, and cured his patients by\r\ntreating them with well-approved remedies. He began also to study\r\njurisprudence before he was thirteen. At the age of eighteen he\r\nentered the service of a prince of the Beni Saman dynasty, Nuh bin\r\nMansur, at Bukhara, a paralytic, who entertained many physicians at\r\nhis court, and Ibn Sina joined their number. There he composed his\r\n'Collection,' in which he treated of all the sciences except\r\nmathematics, and there also he wrote his book of 'The Acquirer and the\r\nAcquired.' He then left Bukhara, and lived in various towns of\r\nKhurasan, but never went further west, spending his whole life in the\r\ncountries beyond the Oxus, in Khwarizm and in Persia, although he\r\nwrote in Arabic. It would be superfluous to follow all his changes of\r\nfortune, but it may be mentioned that when he was the first physician\r\nand vizier of Mezd-ud-daulah, a sultan of the Bowide dynasty, he was\r\ntwice deposed and put in irons. He also appears to have acted\r\ntreacherously towards Ala-ud-daulah, a prince of Ispahan, who was his\r\nbenefactor. He was four years in prison, but at last succeeded in\r\ndeceiving his guardians, and escaped. His dangerous travels, and the\r\ndepression of mind inseparable from reverses of fortune, however,\r\nnever interrupted his scientific pursuits. His taste for study and his\r\nactivity were such that, as he himself informs us, not a single day\r\npassed in which he had not written fifty leaflets. The list of\r\nmanuscripts left by him, and scattered in various libraries of Europe,\r\nis considerable, and though many of his works have been lost, some are\r\nstill in existence. The fatigues of his long journeys, and the\r\nexcesses of all kinds in which he indulged, abridged the life of this\r\ncelebrated scholar, who died in A.D. 1037, at the age of fifty-six, at\r\nHamadan, where the following epitaph adorns his tomb: 'The great\r\nphilosopher, the great physician, Ibn Sina, is dead. His books on\r\nphilosophy have not taught him the art of living well, nor his books\r\non medicine the art of living long.'\r\n\r\nA brief notice must be given of the celebrated physician and\r\nphilosopher, Ali bin Ridhwan, who died A.D. 1067. He was such a\r\nprodigy of precocious learning that he began to lecture on medicine\r\nand philosophy at Cairo from his fourteenth year. He afterwards also\r\ntaught astronomy. At the age of thirty-two he had attained a great\r\nreputation as a physician, and was a rich man at sixty. He left more\r\nthan one hundred books which he had composed, and he himself says: 'I\r\nmade abridgments of the chief philosophical works of the ancients, and\r\nleft in this manner five books on philology; ten on law; the medical\r\nworks of Hippocrates and Galen; the book of plants of Dioskorides; the\r\nbooks of Rufus, Paulus, Hawi, and Razi; four books on agriculture and\r\ndrugs; four books for instruction in the 'Almagest' of Ptolemy, and an\r\nintroduction to the study of it, and to the square of Ptolemy; as also\r\nto the works of Plato, Alexander, Themistios, and Al-Farabi. I\r\npurchased all these books, no matter what they cost, and preserved\r\nthem in chests, although it would have been more profitable to have\r\nsold them again rather than have kept them.' Ibn Batlan, a clever\r\nphysician, was a contemporary of Ibn Ridhwan, and travelled from\r\nBaghdad to Egypt only for the purpose of making his acquaintance, but\r\nthe result does not appear to have been satisfactory to either party.\r\nHe died A.D. 1063, leaving a number of works on medical and other\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nAbu Hamid Al-Ghazali was born A.D. 1058. He was considered chiefly as\r\na lawyer and a mystic, but here he will be noticed chiefly as a\r\nphilosopher and the author of 'The Ruin of Philosophers,' noticed at\r\nlength by Haji Khalfa in his 'Encyclopædical Dictionary,' under No.\r\n3764. But Ghazali's most celebrated work is 'The Resuscitation of\r\nReligious Sciences,' which is so permeated by the genius of Islam\r\nthat, according to the general opinion of scholars, the Muhammadan\r\nreligion, if it were to perish, might again be restored from this work\r\nalone. Orthodox fanatics, nevertheless, attacked his works as being\r\nschismatic, and they were even burnt in the Mugrib. He was born at Tus\r\n(the modern Mashad), in Khurasan, and passed his life partly there,\r\nalso at Naisapur, Baghdad, Damascus, Egypt, and finally returned to\r\nTus, where he died A.D. 1111. His works are very numerous, and all of\r\nthem are instructive.\r\n\r\nIbn Bajah (known to Europeans under the name of Avempace) was a\r\nphilosoper and a poet of considerable celebrity, and a native of\r\nSaragossa, in Spain. He was attacked by some people for his religious\r\nopinions, and represented as an infidel and an atheist, professing the\r\ndoctrines held by the ancient sages and philosophers. Ibn Khallikan\r\ndefends Ibn Bajah, and says that these statements were much\r\nexaggerated, but adds: 'God, however, knows best what his principles\r\nwere,' Abul Hassan Ali al-Imam, of Granada, was of opinion that Ibn\r\nBajah was the greatest Arab philosopher after Al-Farabi, and places\r\nhim higher than Ibn Sina and Al-Ghazali. He left numerous logical,\r\ngrammatical and political works, and died at Fez in A.D. 1138.\r\n\r\nAverroes, whose full and correct name is Abul Walid Muhammad bin\r\nRashid, was a celebrated Arab scholar, born at Cordova A.D. 1126, and\r\nthe author of many writings. He taught in his native town philosophy\r\nand medicine, two sciences which appeared for a long time to be\r\ninseparable, and the vulgar considered those professing them to be of\r\nalmost supernatural attainments. The period of Averroes is that of the\r\ndecadence of Arab dominion in Spain, a period when this great nation\r\nalso lost the taste for sciences which it had brought to Europe.\r\nConsidering the prodigious number of works composed by Averroes, who\r\nfilled at the same time the offices of Imam and Kadi, his entire life\r\nmust have been one of labour and meditation. He is the author of an\r\nArabic version of Aristotle, but it is not the first which existed in\r\nthat language, as some of his biographers assert, because this work\r\nhad been produced already at Baghdad during the brilliant Khalifate of\r\nMamun. There are various manuscripts of Averroes extant treating on\r\nphysics, pure mathematics, astronomy and astrology, from which it\r\nwould appear that, in spite of their encyclopædic attainments, the\r\ncelebrated men of these times still believed in some popular errors.\r\nScience was at that time surrounded by a kind of superstitious halo of\r\nrespect, to which Averroes, like so many others, is indebted for a\r\ngood part of his renown. He died A.D. 1198, in the city of Morocco;\r\nhis corpse was transferred to Cordova and there interred.\r\n\r\nMedical science had already, under the second Khalif of the house of\r\nAbbas (A.D. 754-775), enjoyed the highest honours, which it ever\r\nafterwards retained. Great physicians were brought from the Persian\r\nhospital of Jondshapur, and between the years A.D. 750 and 850 the\r\nnumber of physicians was considerable, but only the most celebrated\r\nwill be noticed.\r\n\r\nGeorgios (Jorjis) bin Bakhtyeshun, of Jondshapur, lived at the\r\ncommencement of the Abbaside dynasty, and was the author of the book\r\nof Pandects. When Al-Mansur was building the city of Baghdad he\r\nsuffered from pains in his stomach and from impotency, and Georgios,\r\nthe director of the medical college at Jondshapur, was recommended to\r\nhim as the most skilled physician of the time. Accordingly, the Khalif\r\ndirected Georgios and two of his pupils, Ibrahim and Serjis, to come\r\nto Baghdad, appointing Gabriel (Jebrayl), the son of Georgios, as\r\ndirector of the hospital in the place of his father. Georgios cured\r\nAl-Mansur, and received from him three thousand ducats for his reward,\r\nalong with a beautiful slave girl; the latter was, however, returned\r\nto the Khalif with thanks, and the remark that, 'being a Christian, he\r\ncould not keep more than one wife.' From that moment the physician\r\nattained free access to the harem, and enjoyed high favour with the\r\nKhalif, who greatly pressed him in A.D. 770 to make a profession of\r\nIslam; but this he refused to do, and died shortly afterwards, in A.D.\r\n771. Before his death Georgios asked to be allowed to return to\r\nJondshapur, to be buried there with his ancestors. Al-Mansur said,\r\n'Fear God, and I guarantee you paradise.' Georgios replied, 'I am\r\nsatisfied to be with my ancestors, be it in paradise or be it in\r\nhell.' The Khalif laughed, allowed him to return home, and presented\r\nhim with ten thousand pieces of gold for his travelling, expenses.\r\n\r\nGabriel (Jebrayl), the son of the above-named Georgios (Jorjis), was\r\nalso a celebrated physician. He enjoyed great favour with\r\nHarun-ar-Rashid, who used to declare that he would not refuse him\r\nanything. When, however, this Khalif fell ill at Tus, and asked Gabriel\r\nfor his opinion, the latter replied that if Harun had followed his\r\nadvice to be moderate in sexual pleasure, he would not have been\r\nattacked by the disease. For this reply he was thrown into prison, and\r\nhis life was saved only by the chamberlain Rabi'i, who was very fond of\r\nhim. Amin, the son and successor of Rashid, followed the advice of\r\nGabriel more than his father did, and would not eat or drink anything\r\nwithout his doctor's sanction. In A.D. 817 Gabriel cured Sehl bin\r\nHasan, who recommended him to Mamun; but Michael, the son-in-law of\r\nGabriel, was his body physician. In A.D. 825 Mamun fell sick, and, as\r\nall the medicines of Michael were of no use, Isa, the brother of Mamun,\r\nadvised him to get himself treated by Gabriel, who had known him from\r\nboyhood; but Abu Ishak, the other brother of Mamun, called in Yahya\r\nbin Maseweih, and when he could do nothing, then Mamun sent for\r\nGabriel, who restored him to health in three days, and was handsomely\r\nrewarded in consequence. When Mamun marched, in A.D. 828, against the\r\nByzantines, Gabriel fell sick and died, whereon the Khalif took\r\nGabriel's son with him on the campaign, he being also an intelligent\r\nand skilled physician.\r\n\r\n  The works of Gabriel are:\r\n\r\n  (1) A treatise on food and drink, dedicated to Mamun.\r\n\r\n  (2) An introduction to logic.\r\n\r\n  (3) Extracts from medical Pandects.\r\n\r\n  (4) A book on fumigatories.\r\n\r\nIsa bin Musa, who flourished about A.D. 833, was also one of the most\r\ndistinguished physicians of the period. He left the following works:\r\n\r\n  (1) Book on the forces of alimentary substances.\r\n\r\n  (2) A treatise for a person who has no access\r\n  to a physician.\r\n\r\n  (3) Questions concerning derivations and races.\r\n\r\n  (4) Book of dreams, indicating why medicines\r\n  should not be given to pregnant women.\r\n\r\n  (5) Book of the remedies mentioned by Hippocrates\r\n  in his treatise on bleeding and cupping.\r\n\r\n  (6) Dissertation on the use of baths.\r\n\r\nWithout giving any details about Maseweih, Yahya bin Maseweih, Honein\r\nbin Ishak, and Kosta bin Luka, all of whom were distinguished for\r\nmedical knowledge, some fuller mention must be made of Abu Bakr\r\nAr-Razi (Rhases), who has been described as 'the ablest physician of\r\nthat age and the most distinguished; a perfect master of the art of\r\nmedicine, skilled in its practice, and thoroughly grounded in its\r\nprinciples and rules.' He composed a number of useful works on\r\nmedicine, and some of his sayings have been handed down to us, and are\r\nstill worthy of record, such as:\r\n\r\n  (1) When you can cure by a regimen, avoid\r\n  having recourse to medicine.\r\n\r\n  (2) When you can effect a cure with a simple\r\n  medicine, avoid employing a compound one.\r\n\r\n  (3) With a learned physician and an obedient\r\n  patient sickness soon disappears.\r\n\r\n  (4) Treat an incipient malady with remedies\r\n  which will not prostrate the strength.\r\n\r\nTill the end of his life he continued at the head of his profession,\r\nfinally lost his sight, and died in A.D. 923. A new and much improved\r\nedition of Razi's 'Treatise on the Small-Pox and Measles' was\r\npublished in London in A.D. 1848 by Dr. Greenhill, and an article on\r\nhim will also be found in Wüstenfeld's 'History of the Arabian\r\nPhysicians.'\r\n\r\nPoetry flourished to a very great extent during the reigns of the\r\nearly Abbaside Khalifs, and, as all Arab _littérateurs_ were more or\r\nless poets and writers of verses, it is somewhat difficult to select\r\nthe most celebrated.\r\n\r\nThe first collection of Arabic poems was compiled by Al-Mofadhdhal in\r\nthe work called after him--'Mofadhdhaliat.' He was followed by Abu Amr\r\nas Shaibani, by Abu Zaid bin A'us, Ibn-as Sikkit, Muhammad bin Habib,\r\nAbu Hatim es Sejastani, and Abu Othman al Mazini. Abu Tammam and\r\nAl-Bohtori, the collectors of the two Hamasas, are considered to be the\r\ntwo greatest poets of the third century of the Hijrah (A.D. 816-913).\r\nAnd it may here be observed that in the great bibliographical\r\ndictionary of Haji Khalfa, who enumerates seven Hamasas, the names of\r\nIbn-ul Marzaban and of Ibn Demash, each of whom composed one, are not\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nZukkari made himself a reputation by editing several of the\r\nMua'llakat, as also the poems of the great pre-Islamite bards,\r\nAl-Aasha and Al-Kama, whilst Abu Bakr as Sauli likewise acquired great\r\nmerit by publishing ten of the master-works of Arabic poetry.\r\n\r\nFrom the many poets of this period some of the most celebrated have\r\nbeen selected--viz., Farazdak, Jarir, Al-Akhtal, Abul-Atahya, Bashshar\r\nbin Burd, Abu Nuwas, Abu Tammam, Al-Otbi, Al-Bohtori, Al-Mutanabbi,\r\nand An-Nami, and a few biographical details about them will be given,\r\nas also some remarks about Al-Mofadhdhal, the first collector and\r\ncompiler of Arab poetry, and of Abul Faraj-Al-Ispahani, the collector\r\nof the great anthology called 'Kitab-ul-Aghani,' or the Book of Songs.\r\n\r\nJarir and Al-Farazdak were two very celebrated poets, who lived at the\r\nsame time and died in the same year, A.D. 728-729. Ibn Khallikan has\r\ngiven their lives at considerable length, and says that 'Jarir was in\r\nthe habit of making satires on Al-Farazdak, who retorted in the same\r\nmanner, and they composed parodies on each other's poems.' Jarir\r\nalways used to say that the same demon inspired them both, and\r\nconsequently each knew what the other would say. On all occasions they\r\nseem to have been excessively rude in verse to each other, and did not\r\nat all mind about having recourse to actual insult. The lives of\r\nAl-Akhtal, Al-Farazdak, and Jarir, translated from the 'Kitab-ul-Aghani'\r\nand other sources, have been given by Mr. Caussin de Perceval in the\r\n_Journal Asiatique_ for the year 1834. Prom this it would appear that\r\nthe verses of these three poets were much discussed during their\r\nlifetime, and often compared with the productions of the other poets\r\nwho followed them. Some writers are in favour of one and some of the\r\nother, but the general opinion of them is that their effusions\r\nresembled the Arab poetry written before the period of Muhammad much\r\nmore than any poetry that was written during the reign of the\r\nAbbasides. Al-Akhtal belonged to a Christian tribe of Arabs, and was\r\nmuch patronized by the Omaiyide Khalif Abdul Malik (A.D. 684-705), in\r\nwhose glory and honour he composed many verses, and, indeed, such good\r\nones, that Harun-ar-Rashid used to say no poet had ever said so much\r\nin praise of the Abbasides as he (Akhtal) had written in praise of the\r\nOmaiyides. He died at an advanced age some years before Jarir and\r\nFarazdak, who were much younger men, but the exact year of his death\r\ndoes not appear to have been recorded.\r\n\r\nThe blind Bashshar bin Burd and Abul-Atahya were two of the principal\r\npoets who flourished in the first ages of Islamism, and ranked in the\r\nhighest class among the versifiers of that period. The former was put\r\nto death, or rather beaten, by the orders of the Khalif Al-Mahdi, for\r\ncertain satirical verses which the poet is said to have written, and\r\nfrom the effects of these strokes of a whip he died in A.D. 783.\r\nAbul-Atahya wrote many verses on ascetic subjects, and all his amatory\r\npieces were composed in honour and praise of Otba, a female slave\r\nbelonging to the Khalif Al-Mahdi, and to whom he appears to have been\r\ndevotedly attached. He was born A.D. 747, and died A.D. 826.\r\n\r\nAbu Nuwas was a poet of great celebrity. His father, Hani, was a\r\nsoldier in the army of Marwan II., the last Omaiyide Khalif, and the\r\npoet was born in A.D. 762, some say in Damascus, others at Busra, and\r\nothers at Al-Ahwaz. His mother apprenticed him to a grocer, and the\r\nboy became acquainted with the poet Abu Osâma, who discovered his\r\ntalent, and induced him to accompany him to Baghdad. There Abu Nuwas\r\nafterwards became celebrated as one of the chief bards at the court of\r\nthe Khalif, and his most famous Kasida is that which he composed in\r\npraise of Amin, the son of Harun-ar-Rashid. According to the critics\r\nof his time, he was the greatest poet in Islam, as Amriolkais had been\r\nbefore that period. When Merzeban was asked which he considered the\r\ngreater poet, Abu Nuwas or Rakashi, he replied, 'A curse of Abu Nuwas\r\nin hell contains more poetry than a laudation of Rakâshi's in\r\nparadise.' He was a favourite of Amin, whom his brother Mamun\r\nreproached for associating with him, because Abu Nuwas enjoyed the\r\nreputation of being the greatest libertine of all the poets.\r\n\r\nSulaiman, the son of Al-Mansur, complained to the Khalif Amin that Abu\r\nNuwas had insulted him with lampoons, and desired him to be punished\r\nwith death; but Amin replied: 'Dear uncle, how can I order a man to be\r\nkilled who has praised me in such beautiful verses?' and thereupon\r\nrecited them.\r\n\r\nMamun, the son of Harun, states that he asked the great critic Yakut\r\nbin Sikkit to what poet he gave the preference. He replied: 'Among the\r\npre-Islamite ones to Amriolkais and Al-Aasha, among the older Muslim\r\npoets to Jarir and Farazdak, and among the more recent to Abu Nuwas.'\r\n\r\nOtbi, having been asked who was the greatest poet, replied; 'According\r\nto the opinion of the people, Amriolkais, but according to mine, Abu\r\nNuwas.'\r\n\r\nAl-Khasib, the chief of the revenue office in Egypt, once asked Abu\r\nNuwas from what family he came. 'My talents,' replied he, 'stand me\r\ninstead of noble birth,' and no further questions were asked him. He\r\nwas a freethinker, who joked about the precepts of Islam. Once a Sunni\r\nand a Rafidhi desired him to be the umpire in their quarrel, as to who\r\noccupied the most exalted position after the Prophet. He said: 'A\r\ncertain Yazid,' and on their asking who this Yazid might be, he\r\nreplied: 'An excellent fellow, who presents me with a thousand dirhems\r\nevery year.' He used to say that the wine of this world is better than\r\nthat of the next; and, being asked for the reason, replied: 'This is a\r\nsample of the wine of paradise, and for a sample the best is always\r\ntaken.'\r\n\r\nIsmail bin Nubakht said: 'I never saw a man of more extensive learning\r\nthan Abu Nuwas, nor one who, with a memory so richly furnished,\r\npossessed so few books. After his decease we searched his house, and\r\ncould only find one book-cover containing a quire of paper, in which\r\nwas a collection of rare expressions and grammatical observations.'\r\n\r\nHe died on the same day as the mystic Al-Kerkhi, whose corpse was\r\naccompanied to the grave by more than three hundred persons, but that\r\nof Abu Nuwas by not one. When, however, one of the three hundred\r\nexclaimed: 'Was not Abu Nuwas a Muslim? And why do none of the Muslims\r\nrecite the funeral prayer over his body? all the three hundred who had\r\nassisted at the interment of Kerkhi recited the prayer also over the\r\ncorpse of Abu Nuwas.\r\n\r\nHe is considered to have been an equally good narrator, scholar, and\r\npoet; and, being asked by Sulaiman bin Sehl what species of poetry he\r\nthought to be the best, replied: 'There are no poems on wine equal to\r\nmy own, and to my amatory compositions all others must yield,' He used\r\nto boast that he knew by heart the poems of sixty poetesses, and among\r\nthem those of Khansa and Leila, as also seven hundred Arjuzat, or\r\npoems in unshackled metre, by men. He said that he could compose\r\nnothing except when he was in a good humour, and in a shady garden. He\r\noften began a Kasida, put it away for several days, and then took it\r\nup again to rescind much of it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Abu Amr, the three greatest poets in the description of\r\nwine are Aasha, Akhtal, and Abu Nuwas. Abu Hatim al Mekki often said\r\nthat the deep meanings of thoughts were concealed underground until\r\nAbu Nuwas dug them out.\r\n\r\nHis end was tragic. Zonbor, the secretary, and Abu Nuwas were in the\r\nhabit of composing lampoons against each other; whereon the former\r\nconceived the idea of propagating a satire against Ali, the son-in-law\r\nof the Prophet, in the name of Abu Nuwas; and this became the cause of\r\nhis death. In an already half-drunken circle Zonbor recited the satire\r\non Ali as the work of Abu Nuwas; on which all fell upon the poet,\r\nripped open his belly, and pulled his entrails about till he expired.\r\nOthers assert that Ismail bin Abu Sehl administered a poisonous potion\r\nto Abu Nuwas, because he had composed a lampoon against him; but its\r\noperation was so slow that he died only four months after he had drunk\r\nit. His death took place at Baghdad in A.D. 810.\r\n\r\nAl-Otbi was a poet of great celebrity, and taught traditions to the\r\npeople of Baghdad; but was more generally noted for drinking wine and\r\ncomposing love verses about his beloved Otba. Being of the tribe of\r\nKoraish, and of the family of Omaya, he and his father held a high\r\nrank, and were regarded as accomplished scholars and elegant speakers,\r\nOtbi both composed and collected poems. One of his verses has now\r\nacquired the force of a proverb: 'When Sulaima saw me turn my eyes\r\naway--and I turn my glances away from all who resemble her--she said:\r\n\"I once saw thee mad with love;\" and I replied: \"Youth is a madness of\r\nwhich old age is the cure.\"' He died in A.D. 842.\r\n\r\nAbu Tammam Habib, the celebrated poet, according to Ibn Khallikan,\r\n'surpassed all his contemporaries in the purity of his style, the\r\nmerit of his poetry, and his excellent manner of treating a subject.\r\nHe is the author of a Hamasa, a compilation which is a standing proof\r\nof his great talents, solid information, and good taste in making a\r\nselection.' He wrote several other works connected with poets and\r\npoetry, composed many Kasidas, and knew by heart, it is said, fourteen\r\nthousand verses of that class of compositions called Rajaz, or free\r\nmetre. The poetry of Abu Tammam was put in order for the first time by\r\nAbu Bakr as Sauli, who arranged it alphabetically, according to the\r\nrhymes, and then Abul Faraj Ali bin Husain Al-Ispahani classed it\r\naccording to the subjects. He died at Mosul A.D. 845, about forty\r\nyears of age, and was buried there; but his verses have survived, and\r\nrendered him one of the immortals.\r\n\r\nThe mantle of the poet Abu Tammam appears to have fallen on Abu Abada\r\nAl-Bohtori, who was born in A.D. 821, and, like his predecessor, is\r\nalso the author of a Hamasa. He appears to have received his first\r\nencouragement to persevere as a poet from Abu Tammam, and later on he\r\nsays: 'I recited to Abu Tammam a poem which I had composed in honour\r\nof one of the Humaid family, and by which I gained a large sum of\r\nmoney. When I finished he exclaimed: \"Very good! You shall be the\r\nprince of poets when I am no more.\" These words gave me more pleasure\r\nthan all the wealth which I had collected.' On being asked whether he\r\nor Abu Tammam was the better poet, Al-Bohtori replied: 'His best\r\npieces surpass the best of mine, and my worst are better than the\r\nworst of his,' Abul-Ala al Maarri, a great philologist and poet (born\r\nin A.D. 973, died A.D. 1057), was asked which was the best poet of the\r\nthree, Abu Tammam, Al-Bohtori, or Al-Mutanabbi; he replied that two of\r\nthem were moralists, and that Bohtori was the poet. He died A.D. 897.\r\nHis poems were not arranged in order till Abu Bakr as Sauli collected\r\nthem and classed them alphabetically by their rhymes, while Abul Faraj\r\nAli bin Husain Al-Ispahani collected them also, and arranged them\r\naccording to their subjects. A copy of his 'Diwan' is in the\r\nBibliothèque Nationale in Paris.\r\n\r\nAl Mutanabbi, or the pretended prophet, a _rôle_ to which he aspired,\r\nbut in which he did not succeed, comes next to the two great\r\npoets--Abu Tammam and Al-Bohtori--though some critics consider him to\r\nbe superior to them. He is, however, generally acknowledged to be a\r\ngreat lyric poet, while many of his best Kasidas refer to the exploits\r\nof Saif ad Dawlah, a prince of the Benou Hamdan dynasty in Syria. After\r\nleaving him he went to Egypt, then to Persia, Baghdad, and finally\r\nKufa, his native place, near which he was killed in a fight in A.D.\r\n965. It is stated that in this contest Mutanabbi, seeing himself\r\nvanquished, was taking to flight, when his slave said to him, 'Let it\r\nnever be said that you fled from a fight, you who are the author of\r\nthis verse: \"The horse, and the night, and the desert know me (well);\r\nthe sword also, and the lance, and paper and the pen.\"'\r\n\r\nUpon this he turned back and fought till he was slain, along with his\r\nson and his slave. His 'Diwan,' or collection of poems, is well known,\r\nand much read in our times, even in India. It has been translated into\r\nGerman.\r\n\r\nAn-Nami was one of the ablest and most talented poets of his time, but\r\ninferior to Mutanabbi, with whom he had some encounters and contests\r\nin reciting extemporary verses when they were at the court of Saif ad\r\nDawlah together. He died A.D. 1008 at Aleppo, aged ninety.\r\n\r\nAbul-Abbas Al-Mofadhdhal, the collector of the celebrated selection of\r\nArabic poems called the 'Mofadhdhaliat,' which served as a model for\r\nthe Hamasas, was the first editor of the seven suspended poems, the\r\nMua'llakat, and also one of the earliest of the Arab philologists. He\r\nwas a native of Kufa, and adhered to the faction of Ibrahim bin\r\nAbdallah; who rebelled in A.D. 761 against Al-Mansur, the second\r\nAbbaside Khalif. Al-Mansur, however, pardoned Al-Mofadhdhal, and\r\nattached him to the household of his son, Al-Mahdi, by whose orders\r\nMofadhdhal made a collection of the most celebrated longer poems of\r\nthe Arabs, one hundred and twenty-eight in number, under the title of\r\nthe Mofadhdhaliat. This, the oldest anthology of Arabian poets, was\r\nfirst commented upon by his disciple, Al-Aarabi; then two hundred\r\nyears later by the two great philologists and anthologists, Al-Anbari\r\nand An-Nahas; by Merzuk; and lastly by Tibrizi, who is sufficiently\r\nknown in Europe as the editor and commentator of the Hamasa, published\r\nby Freytag with a Latin translation. Mofadhdhal supported himself as a\r\ncopyist of the Koran, and spent the last portion of his life in\r\nmosques doing penance for the satires which he had composed against\r\nvarious individuals. His other works were a book of proverbs, a\r\ntreatise on prosody, another on the ideas usually expressed in poetry,\r\nand a vocabulary. He was held to be of the first authority as a\r\nphilologist, a genealogist, and a relator of the poems and battle-lays\r\nof the desert Arabs. He died A.D. 784.\r\n\r\nAbul Faraj Ali bin Husain Al-Ispahani is the collector of the great\r\nanthology called 'Kitab-ul-Aghani' (the Book of Songs). This work,\r\nwhich surpasses all former ones of this name, he produced after a\r\nlabour of forty years, and presented it to Saif ad Dawlah, who gave\r\nhim a thousand pieces of gold for it, but excused himself at the same\r\ntime for the smallness of this honorarium. In spite of his other\r\nworks, and the long string of names given him by Ibn Khallikan, he is\r\nbest known as Al-Ispahani, and as the author of the Aghani. His family\r\ninhabited Ispahan, but he passed his early youth in Baghdad, and\r\nbecame the most distinguished scholar and most eminent author of that\r\ncity. He was born A.D. 897, and died A.D. 967, in which year also died\r\nthe great scholar Kali, and the three greatest of his patrons, namely,\r\nSaif ad Dawlah, the sovereign of the Benou Hamdan in Syria; Moiz ud\r\nDawlah, the sovereign of the Benou Bujeh in Irak; and Kafur, who\r\ngoverned Egypt in the name of the Akhsid dynasty. The 'Book of Songs,'\r\nnotwithstanding its title, is an important biographical dictionary,\r\ntreating of grammar, history and science, as well as of poetry.\r\n\r\nMention can here be made of Abu Muhammad Kassim Al-Hariri, who was one\r\nof the ablest writers of his time, and the author of the 'Makâmat\r\nHariri,' a work consisting of fifty oratorical, poetical, moral,\r\nencomiastic and satirical discourses, supposed to have been spoken or\r\nread in public assemblies. Poets, historians, grammarians and\r\nlexicographers look upon the 'Makâmat' (Assemblies or Séances) as the\r\nhighest authority, and next to the Koran, as far at least as language\r\nis concerned. It contains a large portion of the language spoken by\r\nthe Arabs of the desert, such as its idioms, its proverbs, and its\r\nsubtle delicacies of expression; and, according to Ibn Khallikan, any\r\nperson who acquires a sufficient acquaintance with this book to\r\nunderstand it rightly, will be led to acknowledge the eminent merit of\r\nthe author, his extensive information, and his vast abilities. A great\r\nnumber of persons have commented on the 'Makâmat,' some in long and\r\nothers in short treatises, and many consider it to be the most\r\nelegantly written, and the most amusing, work in the Arabic language.\r\nHariri was born A.D. 1054, and died at Busra A.D. 1122. He left some\r\nother good works in the shape of treatises, epistles, and a great\r\nnumber of poetical pieces, besides those contained in his 'Makâmat.'\r\n\r\nThere are two translations of the 'Makâmat' into English. One by the\r\nReverend Theodore Preston, printed under the patronage of the Oriental\r\nTranslation Fund, London, 1850. It contains only twenty of the fifty\r\npieces in verse, with copious notes, while an epitome of the remaining\r\nthirty pieces is given at the end of the book. The other by the late\r\nMr. Chennery, which ends with the twenty-sixth assembly or séance. The\r\nwhole work was edited in Arabic, with a select commentary upon it in\r\nFrench, by Baron Silvestre de Sacy, and this was reprinted in 1847.\r\nRuckert also made a very free translation of it in German verse, which\r\nreached a third edition in 1844, but this differs widely from the\r\ncontents of the original, though it is said to be more pleasing and\r\nattractive to a general reader.\r\n\r\nAfter the Muslim legal sciences had been established upon the fourfold\r\nfoundations of the Koran, tradition, general consent of communities,\r\nand the analogies derived therefrom, then philosophy and mathematics\r\nbegan to flourish by translations made either directly from the Greek\r\nor through Syriac and Persian.\r\n\r\nIn former times, during the reign of Nausherwan, a Persian monarch of\r\ngreat renown (A.D. 530-578), there was some intercourse between\r\nPersian and Byzantine philosophers; several books on logic and\r\nmedicine had been translated from Greek into Persian, and from these\r\nAbdullah Ibn Al-Mukaffa made translations into Arabic. The literary\r\ncareer of Ibn Al-Mukaffa, who presumed to vie with the eloquence of\r\nthe Koran, and was considered to be a freethinker, and eventually\r\nslain, falls into the reign of Al-Mansur (A.D. 754-775), the second\r\nKhalif. But Ibn Al-Mukaffa rendered such services to Arabian\r\nliterature, that a short sketch of his life will presently be given.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Mansur (A.D. 754-775) Greek works were translated,\r\nnot yet from the original, but from the Persian. During the Khalifate\r\nof his son, Mahdi (A.D. 775-785), Abd-Allah bin Hilal translated the\r\ncelebrated animal fables of Bidpay from Persian into Arabic, under the\r\ntitle of 'Kalilah wa Dimnah,' and they were afterwards versified by\r\nSelil bin Nubakht. In Persian they are known under several titles,\r\nsuch as 'Kalilah wa Dimnah,' the 'Anwar-i Suheli,' and the 'Ayar\r\nDanish,' and in Turkish as the 'Humayan-namah.'\r\n\r\nEight years before the seventh Khalif, Mamun (A.D. 812-833), ascended\r\nthe throne, many Greek and Syrian manuscripts had been collected in\r\nBaghdad. These were all preserved there in the library, which was\r\ncalled 'The House of Wisdom,' until Mamun began to utilize them by\r\nmeans of translations. The Khalif appointed the scholars Al-Hajjaj, Ibn\r\nMáttar, Ibn ul-Batrik, and Selma, to superintend the work, while the\r\nthree brothers, Muhammad, Ahmed, and Hasan, sons of the astronomer\r\nShakir, were directed to search for and to buy manuscripts. Mamun also\r\nsent the two physicians, Yohanna and Kosta, into the Byzantine\r\ndominions to bring manuscripts from thence to Baghdad. A new class of\r\nscholars was then formed, in the shape of translators, who were\r\nemployed in translating works from the Greek, the Syriac, and the\r\nPersian languages into Arabic. The translators from the Persian were\r\nMusa and Yusuf, the two sons of Khalid, Hasan bin Sehl, and\r\nafterwards, Al-Baladori; from the Sanscrit, Munkah the Indian; from\r\nthe Nabataean, Ibn Wahshiyah. Science became hereditary, as it were,\r\nin the families of the most celebrated scholars; medical science in\r\nthe family of Bakhtyeshun; translations from Greek works in that of\r\nHonein bin Ishak, the most famous of all translators, and a prolific\r\nauthor besides. Maseweih and his son Yahya, Syriac Christians, were\r\nboth celebrated as physicians and translators of ancient Greek works\r\ninto Arabic; while Kosta bin Luka, who died in A.D. 932, was also one\r\nof the most fertile translators from Greek into Arabic, and, being\r\nborn a Greek, he was able to correct the translations of Honein bin\r\nIshak and others.\r\n\r\nThe number of translators, which amounted to about one hundred, might\r\nhave been increased if Arab literature had further developed itself by\r\nincorporating works from other languages; but, as such was not the\r\ncase, translators appeared very few and far between after the\r\nliterature had attained to its highest perfection, at the end of the\r\nthird century of the Hijrah (A.D. 913).\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Ibn Al-Mukaffa was one of the earliest and best\r\ntranslators. His full name is Abd-Allah Ibn Al-Mukaffa, but before he\r\nmade his profession of Islam he bore that of Ruzbeh. He was a native\r\nof Har, a town in the province of Fars, and first served as secretary\r\nto Daud bin Hobeirah, and then to Isa bin Ali, the uncle of the two\r\nfirst Khalifs of the house of Abbas. He was an excellent poet,\r\nletter-writer, and orator, equally skilled in his mother-tongue, the\r\nPersian, as in the Arabic language, from the former of which he left\r\nthe splendid translations of--\r\n\r\n  (1) 'The Khodanamah,' a legend.\r\n\r\n  (2) 'The Amirnamah,' or prince-book.\r\n\r\n  (3) 'Kalilah wa Dimnah.'\r\n\r\n  (4) 'Merdak.'\r\n\r\n  (5) 'Biography of Nausherwan.'\r\n\r\n  (6) 'The Great Book of Manners.'\r\n\r\n  (7) 'The Small Book of Manners or Good\r\n  Habits.'\r\n\r\n  (8) 'The Book of Epistles.'\r\n\r\nSo far the 'Fihrist'; what follows is from Ibn Khallikan. Ibn\r\nAl-Mukaffa was the secretary and most confidential servant of Isa bin\r\nAli, with whom he dined the day before he made his public profession\r\nof Islam. Having sat down, he began to eat and to mutter according to\r\nthe custom of the Magians. 'How,' said Isa, 'you mutter like the\r\nMagians, though resolved to embrace Islamism!' to which Ibn Al-Mukaffa\r\nreplied that he did not wish to pass a single night without being of\r\nsome religion. In spite of his conversion, he was always suspected of\r\nfreethinking, like Muti bin Iyas and Yahya bin Zaad, and one day, when\r\nAl-Jahiz, the philologist, made the remark that they were persons the\r\nsincerity of whose religious sentiments was doubted, one of the\r\nlearned, on hearing this, said: 'How is it that Al-Jahiz forgets to\r\ncount himself?'\r\n\r\nWhen Khalil the prosodist was one day asked his opinion about Ibn\r\nAl-Mukaffa, he said, 'His learning is greater than his wit;' and the\r\nlatter, being asked the same question concerning Khalil, replied, 'His\r\nwit is greater than his learning.' Being a favourite with the Khalif,\r\nhe took great liberties with Sofyan, the Governor of Busra, and\r\ninsulted the memory of his mother. One day Sulaiman and Isa, the\r\nuncles of the Khalif Mansur, desired to obtain a letter of amnesty\r\nfrom him for their brother Abd-Allah, and they instructed Ibn\r\nAl-Mukaffa to compose one in the strongest terms, which he did, and\r\nadded to it the following clause, 'Should the Prince of the Believers\r\never act treacherously towards his uncle Abd-Allah, then may he be\r\ndivorced from his wives, may his slaves be free, and may his subjects\r\nbe solved from obedience!' The Khalif's dignity was shocked, and he\r\nordered the writer of this letter of amnesty to be forthwith executed,\r\nand the Governor of Busra, whom Ibn Al-Mukaffa had many times insulted,\r\nvery gladly undertook the duty. Al-Madaini narrates that when Ibn\r\nAl-Mukaffa was brought before Sofyan, the latter asked him whether he\r\nremembered the insults he had heaped upon his mother, and added, 'May\r\nmy mother really deserve those insults if I do not get you executed in\r\na manner hitherto unheard of!' He also recalled Ibn Al-Mukaffa's joke\r\nabout Sofyan's big nose, because he had one day asked the governor,\r\n'How are you and your nose?' On another occasion, when the governor\r\nremarked that he never had reason to repent keeping silence, Ibn\r\nAl-Mukaffa replied, 'Dumbness becomes you; then why should you repent\r\nof it.' Accordingly Sofyan ordered the members of Ibn Al-Mukaffa's body\r\nto be chopped off, one after the other, and thrown into a burning\r\noven, into which, last of all, the trunk of his body was also thrown.\r\nThere are other accounts of his death, viz., that he was strangled in\r\na bath, or shut up in a privy. One opinion, however, generally\r\nprevails, that the execution was not a public one. The date of it is\r\nuncertain--A.D. 756, 759, and 760, are all given; but the victim was\r\nonly thirty-six years of age at the time.\r\n\r\nA few remarks may be made about the support given to learning and men\r\nof letters by the Omaiyide and Abbaside Khalifs, as also by those of\r\nthe Spanish or Western Khalifate.\r\n\r\nThe Omaiyide Khalifs, with their capital at Damascus, were generally\r\npatrons of science, poetry, architecture, song, and music. But all\r\nthese branches of knowledge were at that time merely rudimental; and,\r\nof the fourteen sovereigns of the dynasty, only five really deserve\r\nthe name of protectors of learning; and of these Abdul Malik (A.D.\r\n684-705), and his son Walid I. (A.D. 705-715), were the most\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of their Khalifate there were not only male, but\r\nalso some female poets. All their poems are mostly short, and confined\r\nto amatory, laudatory, or vituperative compositions, called forth by\r\nthe momentary circumstances in which the authors happened to be\r\nplaced. These pieces do not represent either deep thought or profound\r\nwisdom, but they show the feelings of the people, and their state of\r\ncivilization at the time in question.\r\n\r\nDuring this Khalifate were also produced the earliest germs of\r\nstylistics, epistolography and mysticism, all of which were more fully\r\ndeveloped under the Abbasides. The originator of the first two was the\r\nKatib Abd Al-Hamid, secretary to the last Omaiyide Khalif, and he is\r\ndesignated in an old Arabic rhyme as 'the father of all secretaries.'\r\nEpistolary writing, it was said, began with Abd Al-Hamid, and finished\r\nwith Ibn Al-Amid. As regards mysticism, the origin of its doctrines is\r\nsometimes assigned to Oweis Al-Kareni, the Prophet's companion, who\r\ndisappeared mysteriously in A.D. 658. But mysticism and Sufism were\r\nsubsequently much developed by Muhi-uddin Muhammad, surnamed Ibn\r\nAl-Arabi, a most voluminous writer on these subjects. He was born at\r\nMurcia, in Spain, A.D. 1165, and after studying in that country, went\r\nto the East, made the pilgrimage, visited Cairo and other cities, and\r\ndied at Damascus A.D. 1240. He is the author of many works, but the\r\nmost remarkable of them are 'Revelations obtained at Mecca' and\r\n'Maxims of Wisdom set as Jewels.' Both Makkari the historian, and Von\r\nHammer Purgstall, in his history of Arabian literature from the\r\nearliest times, give a long account of him.\r\n\r\nOf the Khalifs of the house of Abbas, the second, third, fifth and\r\nseventh, viz., Al-Mansur (A.D. 754-775), Al-Mahdi (A.D. 775-785),\r\nHarun-ar-Rashid (A.D. 786-809), and Al-Mamun (A.D. 812-833) were the\r\nmost distinguished as patrons of art, science and literature. But\r\nafter the translation of the 'Arabian Nights' into European languages,\r\nthe name of Harun-ar-Rashid became the best known in Europe as the\r\nrepresentative of the most brilliant period of the Eastern Khalifate,\r\nand as the great protector of Arabic literature.\r\n\r\nBaghdad, the capital of the Abbasides, was founded by their second\r\nKhalif, Al-Mansur, in A.D. 760, finished in four years, and raised to\r\na high degree of splendour by Harun-ar-Rashid. Originally it was\r\nconsidered only as a great strategic point, and its garrisons were to\r\nkeep the surrounding country in subjection. Eventually it became the\r\ncentre of learning and civilization, and an Arab author wrote of it as\r\nfollows: 'Baghdad is certainly the capital of the world, and the mine\r\nof every excellence. It is the city whose inhabitants have always been\r\nthe first to unfurl the banners of knowledge, and to raise the\r\nstandard of science; indeed, their subtlety in all branches of\r\nlearning, their gentle manners and amiable disposition, noble bearing,\r\nacuteness, wit, penetration and talent are deservedly praised.'\r\nBaghdad, at the beginning of the ninth century of the Christian era,\r\nwas the centre of all that was grand and brilliant in the Muhammadan\r\nworld. Art and commerce, literature and science, were cultivated to a\r\nhigh degree, and the luxury and extravagance of court life exceeded\r\nalmost the imagination of temperate European minds.\r\n\r\nEverything curious, romantic and wonderful, narrated in the 'Nights'\r\nis connected with Harun-ar-Rashid's name, or supposed to have happened\r\nin his reign. Thus, his vizier, Jaafar, the Barmekide, the\r\nsuperintendent of his harem, Mesrur, and his spouse, Zobeida, were\r\nfirst made known to novel-readers, and their importance as historical\r\npersonages were duly appreciated afterwards, when Erpenius, Pococke,\r\nHerbelot, and Reiske elucidated the history of the Khalifate by\r\ntranslating the works of the Arab chroniclers Abul-Faraj, Al-Makin,\r\nand Abul-feda. Later on still further information was made public\r\nabout the translations made from Greek and Syriac into Arabic during\r\nhis reign, as also concerning his position, not only as a lover of\r\ntales, but as a promoter of jurisprudence, a patron of the medical and\r\nmathematical sciences, and a builder of magnificent and useful\r\nedifices. His court was also well attended by poets and singers.\r\n\r\nHarun was not, indeed, the first prince who made arrangements for\r\ntranslations from the Greek and the Syriac. In this he had been\r\npreceded, as already mentioned, by the Omaiyide prince, Khalid, the\r\nalchemist. But during the reign of Harun the business of translation\r\nwas carried on to a much greater extent than it was under his\r\npredecessors, the Khalifs Mansur and Mahdi, during whose time\r\ntranslations were undertaken from Greek into Syriac, from Indian\r\n(Sanscrit) into Persian, but not yet into Arabic. The translators were\r\nmostly Christians and Jews. Theophilos of Edessa, the Maronite\r\ntranslator of Homer and of other Greek classics into Syriac, was an\r\nastronomer and an historian. Both he and the physician Georgios, son\r\nof Bakhtyeshun, from the university of Jondshapur, were Christians.\r\nNubakht, the astronomer of the Khalif Mansur, was a Magian\r\n(Zoroastrian), Yahya bin Maseweih, Harun's physician, translated\r\nmedical works. Hajaj bin Yusuf bin Matta dedicated his first edition\r\nof the elements of Euclid to Harun, and the second to Mamun.\r\n\r\nAs the family of the Barmekides played an important part, not only in\r\npolitics, but also in literature, until its chief members were\r\nannihilated by Harun's orders, a brief notice of them may here be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nKhalid bin Barmek was the son of a priest at the fire temple of\r\nNevbehar in Balkh, and became in course of time vizier of the first\r\nAbbaside Khalif, and was retained in that office by the second Khalif,\r\nAl-Mansur, and by the third, Al-Mahdi. He died A.D. 780.\r\n\r\nYahya, the son of Khalid, not only himself became the vizier of Harun,\r\nbut also his two sons, Fadhl and Jaafar. Yahya was very liberal, and\r\ngave away sometimes considerable sums of money for very small\r\nservices, or, indeed, for no service at all. After his son Jaafar had\r\nbeen executed, Yahya was thrown into prison, along with his other son,\r\nFadhl, at Old Rakka, where he died in A.D. 805, at the age of seventy\r\nor seventy-four.\r\n\r\nFadhl, the son of Yahya, was more liberal but less eloquent than his\r\nbrother Jaafar. Harun esteemed the two brothers so highly that he\r\nentrusted his son Muhammad to the care of Fadhl, and his son Mamun to\r\nthe care of Jaafar. Afterwards he made Jaafar his vizier, and sent\r\nFadhl to be Governor of Khurasan. There Fadhl built mosques,\r\nreservoirs of water and caravanserais, augmented the army, and\r\nattracted numbers of emigrants to the country, whereby he gained the\r\napproval of Harun, who ordered his poets to sing his praises. After\r\nthe execution of Jaafar, Harun took Yahya, with his son Fadhl and all\r\nthe Barmekides, to Rakka, giving Yahya the option to go where he\r\nliked; but he preferred to be imprisoned with his son in Rakka. There\r\nFadhl died in A.D. 809, and when Harun was informed of his death, he\r\nsaid: 'My own is not far,' and died a few months afterwards in Tus,\r\nthe modern Mashad. The death of Fadhl, as a generous patron, was\r\nbewailed by several poets, such as Abul Hojna, Otbi, Abu Nuwas, and\r\nothers. Fadhl was also notable for his filial piety, and when the use\r\nof cold water injured the health of his father whilst they were in\r\nprison, he used to warm the water by placing a pot of it on his own\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nJaafar (the brother of Fadhl and a son of Yahya), who was slain A.D.\r\n802, is to be mentioned here, not for his tragic fate, which is well\r\nknown, but rather for his literary attainments, especially his oratory\r\nand his style, in both of which he excelled. From his long biography,\r\nwritten by Ibn Khallikan, there will be given here only some extracts\r\nrelating to science and literature. He was a great master of speech,\r\nand expressed his thoughts with much elegance. In one night he\r\nendorsed more than a thousand petitions addressed to the Khalif with\r\nhis decisions, all of which were in perfect concordance with the law.\r\nHis instructor in jurisprudence had been Abu Yusuf the Hanifite, whom\r\nhis father Yahya had appointed to teach him. The favour enjoyed by\r\nJaafar with Harun-ar-Rashid was so great that this Khalif caused one\r\nrobe to be made with two separate collars, which they both wore at the\r\nsame time. Ibn Khallikan narrates the traditions relating to the fall\r\nof Jaafar and his family; the one refers to his amours with Abbasa,\r\nthe sister of Harun, and to the birth of a child; the other to the\r\nescape of a member of Ali's family entrusted to Jaafar's guardianship\r\nby Harun. The true cause was probably the Khalifs envy of the power,\r\nwealth, and generosity of the Barmekides, along with the backbitings\r\nof their enemies. Jaafar was slain at Al-Omr in the district of\r\nAl-Anbar, his head and the trunk of his body were set up opposite to\r\neach other on the two sides of the bridge of Baghdad, and his death\r\nwas lamented by various poets.\r\n\r\nAfter Mamun (A.D. 812-833) the most intellectual Khalif appears to\r\nhave been Radhi-billah (A.D. 934-940). His poems were collected in a\r\nDiwan. He was the last Khalif who presided not only over the\r\nGovernment as a sovereign, but also over the pulpit as Imam; indeed,\r\nhe may be said to be the terminal point of the power, brilliancy and\r\nindependence of the house of Abbas, which henceforth gradually\r\ndeclined till its final extinction with the conquest of Baghdad by the\r\nMughals in A.D. 1258.\r\n\r\nThe great chess-player, Abu-bakr as Sauli, bears witness, in Masudi's\r\n'Meadows of Gold,' to the great accomplishments of Radhi-billah, and\r\nto his love of the sciences. Of games, chess and nerd[4] flourished\r\nduring his reign, and although the perfection of song and of\r\nlute-playing had already passed away, singers and musicians are still\r\nmentioned. Of the amusements of the court, hunting appears to have\r\nflourished most, and the learned poet Koshajim, who wrote on the game\r\nof nerd, also left instructive poems on the chase. Radhi-billah\r\nappears to have been fond of books of travel and of natural history,\r\nand of the society of men of letters and of science, and liked\r\nlistening to recitals on the history, politics, and glory of the old\r\nPersian kings.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 4: Nerd.--This game is mentioned as early as the\r\n     Shah-Namah, the author of which, Firdausi, was of opinion\r\n     that it is of genuine Persian, and not of Indian origin,\r\n     like chess, but this assertion is not necessarily correct.\r\n     Hyde has described the game in his 'Historia Nerdiludii,'\r\n     and it resembles somewhat the German puff and triktrak, and\r\n     the English backgammon. It is played on a board divided into\r\n     black-and-white compartments, with a black and a white house\r\n     in the centre. The moves are made according to the numbers\r\n     that come up on the throw of two dice.]\r\n\r\nOf the Spanish Khalifs, mention only will be made of the ninth\r\nsovereign of the Benou Omaiyide dynasty in Andalusia, viz., Hakim II.,\r\nwho died A.D. 976. Among the five Arab rulers of Spain--viz., three\r\nAbd-ar-Rahmans and two Hakims--who have acquired everlasting fame in\r\nhistory as special friends of science and patrons of learned men,\r\nAbd-ar-Rahman III. and Hakim II. are the greatest and most prominent.\r\nThey stand in the Arab literary history of the West as high as Harun\r\nand his son Mamun do in the history of the literature of the East. As\r\nMamun was the greatest of the Benou Abbas Khalifs of Baghdad who\r\npromoted science and art, so Hakim II. was the greatest of the Benou\r\nOmaiyides in Cordova. From his earliest youth he had received a most\r\ncareful scientific education, and applied his energies to study, as he\r\ncould not devote them to public affairs on account of the long\r\nduration of his father's reign, from A.D. 912 to 961. Hakim's father,\r\nAbd-ar-Rahman III., invited the learned Abu Ali Ismail Al Kali, the\r\nphilologist and author, from the court of Baghdad, where he enjoyed\r\nthe greatest consideration with the Khalif Mutwakkil, to Cordova, and\r\nentrusted him with the education of his son, who, later on, composed a\r\nDiwan (collection of poems), divided into twenty parts, bearing, like\r\nthe Surahs, or Chapters of the Koran, the most sublime objects of\r\nnature as titles, such as 'Heaven,' 'the Stars,' 'the Dawn,' 'the\r\nNight,' etc. Hakim pursued his studies under Kali for twenty years,\r\nwith as much pleasure as advantage, and after ascending the throne,\r\nscience and art still remained his companions. When his father died,\r\nand he assumed the Government, he led the funeral procession,\r\nsurrounded by his Andalusian, Slavonic, and Mograbin body-guard, and\r\ninterred the corpse with the greatest pomp in the mausoleum of Rozafa,\r\nand after that accepted the homage of his Viziers, Amirs, Kayids, and\r\nKadis. Astrologers and poets heralded at Cordova and in the whole of\r\nAndalusia the continuation of the father's prosperous reign by his\r\nson, and spoke the truth this time.\r\n\r\nHakim, who had already as a youth been fond of books, now, when he\r\nbecame sovereign, fully satisfied this predilection, which had grown\r\nto be a passion. He spared neither trouble nor expense in collecting\r\nin his Merwan palace the rarest and most costly books in every branch\r\nof science from all countries. He sent special commissioners to Egypt,\r\nSyria, Irak, and Persia to purchase books. At Baghdad, Muhammad bin\r\nTurkhan was charged with the business of purchasing books, or getting\r\nthem copied, for which purpose he had an establishment of\r\ncalligraphers and stenographers; because of some books beautiful, and\r\nof others rapidly made, copies were required. He procured all the\r\ngenealogies, all the histories, and all the poems of the Arabs; all\r\nworks on law and jurisprudence, on grammar, rhetoric, philosophy,\r\nphilology, mathematics, astronomy, arithmetic and geography, composed\r\nin Arabic. Thus the library of the Merwan palace became not only the\r\nrichest in Islam, but also the best arranged, by the care which he\r\nbestowed on it. The catalogue consisted of forty-four fascicles, each\r\nof fifty leaves, so that the whole constituted a volume of two\r\nthousand two hundred leaves, two-fifths of which were filled with\r\ntitles of poetical works only. In this catalogue the titles of the\r\nbooks were inserted, with the names of their authors, their descent,\r\nbirth-place, the year of their birth and of their decease, in the most\r\naccurate manner, to serve as a model for other libraries, of which\r\nSpain contained so many. This library alone is said to have consisted\r\nof six hundred thousand volumes, a number never surpassed by any\r\nearlier or later libraries in Islam.\r\n\r\nTo his two brothers, who loved the sciences as ardently as himself,\r\nHakim entrusted the care of the libraries, and of public instruction,\r\nappointing Abdul Latif to be the chief librarian, and another man to\r\nbe the director of studies. He kept up intercourse with the great\r\nscholars of the East and of the West, with sundry persons in Syria,\r\nwith learned men in Egypt, and with Abul Faraj Al-Ispahani (author of\r\nthe great anthology 'Kitab-ul-Aghani') in Irak, giving houses and\r\nsalaries to those who chose to reside at his court.\r\n\r\nA few words must be said about the establishment of places of learning\r\nwhich were celebrated at the time. The first university, in the sense\r\nin which such an institution is at present understood, was flourishing\r\nin Syria long before any seat of learning of this kind had been\r\nestablished in Europe; and there was another in Egypt. The first\r\ninstitution was called 'The Society of the Brethren of Purity,' and\r\nthe second (opened at Cairo on the 24th May, A.D. 1005) was founded by\r\nAl-Hakim-bramrillah, and bore the name of Dar-ul Hikinat, or Abode of\r\nWisdom. It was under this same name that the library of the Khalifs\r\nwas formerly known at Baghdad. Later on the great vizier Nizam-ul-Mulk\r\nfounded a high school at Baghdad, in A.D. 1066. It was not the first\r\nthat had been established in Islam, but it eclipsed all others of the\r\nkind by the abilities of the professors who worked there, viz., the\r\nImam Abu Ishak Shirazi, Al-Ghazali, and others. With the Society of\r\nthe Brethren of Purity, mentioned above, there were two men closely\r\nconnected, viz., Al-Tavhidi, who died A.D. 985, and Al-Majridi, who\r\ndied A.D. 1004, the former in the East, the latter in the West, and\r\nboth of them are deserving of the general name of philosopher. So much\r\nfor the Eastern Khalifates. As regards the Western Khalifate, still\r\ngreater attention was paid to education and learning there. The\r\nschools and lectures were attended by many Europeans, who were not,\r\nperhaps, sufficiently grateful to the Arabs for keeping up a progress\r\nin literature and science while Europe itself was struggling for\r\nemancipation from the dark ages which followed the higher cultures of\r\nGreece and of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD PERIOD.\r\n\r\nFrom the fall of Baghdad, in A.D. 1258, to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of Baghdad by the Mughals is a most remarkable period,\r\nnot only in the literature, but also in the history, of the Arabs. It\r\nmarks the final extinction of the Abbaside dynasty, from whom the\r\nancient power and glory had vanished to such a degree that the\r\nauthority of the Khalifs may almost literally be said to have been\r\nconfined to the city only. Halaku Khan, the brother of the grand Khan\r\nKubilai, and grandson of Jenghiz Khan, took and sacked Baghdad,\r\nkeeping the Khalif imprisoned for some time, but slaying him at last,\r\nwith his sons and several thousand Abbasides. Al-Mustaa'sim was the\r\nthirty-seventh and last Khalif of the house of Abbas, which had\r\nreigned over five hundred years, and was now extinguished.\r\n\r\nHalaku Khan attacked Baghdad by the advice of Khojah Nasir-uddin Tusy,\r\nthe great Persian astronomer and mathematician. Nasir-uddin had\r\nentered the service of the last prince of the Assassins only for the\r\npurpose of avenging himself on the Khalif, who had disparaged one of\r\nhis works. When, however, he became aware of Halaku's power, he not\r\nonly betrayed his new master to him, but led the Mughal conqueror also\r\nto Baghdad. After the burning of the library at Alamut (the stronghold\r\nof the Assassins, where they kept their literary treasures) and the\r\nsacking of Baghdad by Halaku Khan, the erection of the astronomical\r\nobservatory at Maragha, under the direction of Nasir-uddin Tusy, was\r\nthe first sign that Arab civilization and the cultivation of science\r\nhad not been entirely extinguished by Tartar barbarism. The learned\r\nviziers who stood by the side of the conqueror, such as the two\r\nbrothers Juvaini, were Persians, and therefore hardly belong to the\r\nhistory of Arab literature. But the fact that one of these two\r\nhistorians now wrote 'The Heart Opener,' also implies that the\r\ninvasion of the barbarians had not quite put an end to literary\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nMore than ten historians flourished at the beginning of this period\r\nwhose names terminated with 'din,' such as Baha-uddin, Imad-uddin,\r\nKamal-uddin, etc., and they were contemporaries of the Arab Plutarch\r\nIbn Khallikan, already mentioned and described in the preceding\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe 'Alfiyya,' or Quintessence of Arab Grammar, was written in verse\r\nby Jamal-uddin Abu Abdallah Muhammad, known under the name of Ibn\r\nMalik. The author died in A.D. 1273-1274; but his work has lived, and\r\nit is looked upon as a good exponent of the system. The Arab text has\r\nbeen published, with a commentary upon it in French, by Silvestre de\r\nSacy, A.D. 1834.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighth century of the Hijrah (A.D. 1301-1398), there lived\r\nthree distinguished men, one famed as a geographer and traveller, and\r\nthe other two as historians, viz., Ibn Batuta, Abul Feda, and Ibn\r\nKhaldun. The first-named left his native town, Tangiers, in A.D. 1324,\r\nand travelled all over the East, performing his pilgrimage to Mecca in\r\nA.D. 1332. The travels of Ibn Batuta were translated by the Rev. S.\r\nLee, and published by the Oriental Translation Fund, as their first\r\nwork, in A.D. 1829. This traveller has been noticed by Kosegarten in a\r\nLatin treatise, and his travels have been also translated into French,\r\nwith the Arabic text above, by C. Defremery and R. Sanguinetti, at the\r\nexpense of the French Government (1874-1879).\r\n\r\nAbul Feda Ismail Hamawi is well known as an historian, and is\r\nfrequently mentioned by Gibbon as one of his authorities. He wrote an\r\naccount of the regions beyond the Oxus, and also an abridgment of\r\nuniversal history down to his own time, and as he is supposed to be\r\nvery exact, and his style elegant, his works are very much esteemed.\r\nHe died A.D. 1345, having succeeded his brother Ahmad as King of Hamat\r\nin Syria, A.D. 1342.\r\n\r\nIbn Khaldun, the African philosopher, was born in Tunis, A.D. 1332,\r\nand passed his youth in Egypt. He served a short time as Chief Justice\r\nat Damascus, and returned to Egypt, where he became Supreme Judge, and\r\ndied there A.D. 1406. His principal and most remarkable work is the\r\n'History of the Arabs, the Persians, and the Berbers.'\r\n\r\nDuring the ninth century of the Hijrah (A.D. 1398-1495) Arabian\r\nliterature can still boast of a few great names. Ibn-Hajar was not\r\nonly the continuator of Ibn Kesir's universal history, called 'The\r\nBeginning and the End,' but also the author of biographies of\r\ncelebrated men who had lived during the preceding century, and of\r\nother works besides. He died A.D. 1449. Ibn Arabshah was the writer of\r\na history of Timour, or Tamerlane, which has some celebrity, and has\r\nbeen translated into Latin and French. He was a native of Damascus,\r\nand died there A.D. 1450.\r\n\r\nMajr-uddin Muhammad Bin Yakub, surnamed Firuzabadi, a learned Persian,\r\nwas the author of the largest and most celebrated Arabic dictionary in\r\nexistence at the time, called the 'Qânûs,' or Ocean, a standard work\r\nto this day, and always greatly praised, and also used by European\r\nlexicographers.\r\n\r\nTaki-uddin, of Fez, composed the best history of Mekka, and A'ini, who\r\ndied A.D. 1451, wrote two celebrated historical works. But the\r\ngreatest historian of this time was Al-Makrisi, whose proper name was\r\nTaki-uddin Ahmad, and who was born at Makris, near Baalbec, in A.D.\r\n1366. He early devoted himself to the study of history, geography,\r\nastrology, etc., at Cairo, and his Egyptian history and topography is\r\nstill an important work, describing the state of the country and its\r\nrulers. He died at Cairo, A.D. 1442. Some of his works have been\r\ntranslated into French and Latin, and are still referred to.\r\n\r\nIn honour of Sayuti, that colossus of learning, who cultivated,\r\naccording to the spirit of his times, so many sciences, and dealt with\r\nthem practically, this might be called the poly-historical and\r\npoly-geographical period. Julal-uddin Sayuti is said to be the author\r\nof some four hundred works, and he died in A.D. 1505, some twelve years\r\nbefore the conquest of Egypt by Selim I, the Sultan of Turkey, when\r\nindependent Arab literature under Arab sovereigns came to an end. It\r\nis true enough that not only in Egypt and Syria, but also in Turkey\r\nand Persia, Arabic books were written afterwards, but more under\r\nforeign protection, although in the two first-named countries Arabic\r\nis the language of the people, while in the last two it occupies\r\nnearly the same position that Latin does in European universities and\r\nin the Roman Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century of the Hijrah (A.D. 1495-1592) the generally\r\nprevalent belief that the world would, at the completion of it, come\r\nto an end, contributed much to the gradual decay of science and\r\nliterature. The case is somewhat analogous to the superstition in\r\nEurope some six hundred years previously, when the Christian era\r\nattained its millennium, which was considered to carry with it the\r\nsame catastrophe. This prophecy, believed to be true, contributed in\r\nsome measure to slacken authority as well as exertion, and the power\r\nof Islamitic countries really sank; but this might have been predicted\r\nwithout any prophetic foresight. In one part of Islam, the ruin of\r\nMuhammadan countries thus prophesied was accomplished twenty-one years\r\nbefore the end of the thousandth year, that is in the 979th year of\r\nthe Hijrah, A.D. 1571, by the total expulsion of the Moors from Spain.\r\nGranada itself had succumbed already, seventy-nine years before, and\r\nthe unwieldy palace of the kings, of Spain (still unfinished) had\r\nrisen by the side of the lofty arcades of the Alhambra, still a lovely\r\nspecimen of Moorish artistic design and architecture.\r\n\r\nThe tenth century of the Hijrah (A.D. 1495-1592), which was the first\r\nof the decay of Arab literature, is to be considered as the period\r\nwhen the political importance of Turkey culminated in the reign of\r\nSulaiman the Law-giver. There were, however, four authors of celebrity\r\nwho wrote both in Arabic and in Turkish. Ibn Kamal Pasha, the surname\r\nof Mufti Shams-uddin Ahmad bin-Sulaiman, who died A.D. 1534, wrote on\r\nhistory in Turkish, and on law in Arabic; the Mufti Abu Sa'ud acquired\r\ngreat renown by his numerous Fetwas (legal decisions), approving of\r\nthe political institutions of Sulaiman; Ibrahim of Aleppo is the\r\nauthor of the 'Molteka' (Confluence of Two Seas), which embodies the\r\nessence of Muslim law, according to the Hanifi ritual; and lastly,\r\nBirgeli, otherwise known as Mulla Muhammad Ibn Pir Ali ul-Birkali, was\r\nequally great as a dogmatist and as a grammarian. He wrote in Arabic\r\n'The Unique Pearl; or, The Art of Reading the Koran,' and died A.D.\r\n1573. Special mention, too, must be made of Mulla Ahmad Bin Mustafa,\r\nthe celebrated Arabian, whom Haji-Khalfa always calls by the more\r\neuphonious name of Abul-Khair (Father of Wisdom). This author is\r\nworthy of notice, on account of the Arabic works he wrote on\r\nbiographical, historical, and especially encyclopædic subjects. His\r\n'Key of Felicity' will remain for ever the best encyclopædia of\r\nArabian sciences, representing as it does their division among the\r\nArabs, with notices of the works of scholars in every branch of them\r\nin a most compact and comprehensive manner. He died A.D. 1560.\r\n\r\nThe three most celebrated calligraphers of this century were\r\nHamdallah, who died A.D. 1518; Mir Ali, who died A.D. 1544; and\r\nMuhammad Hussain Tabrizi, who died A.D. 1574. Their names are just as\r\ncelebrated for Thuluth and Talik writing as were formerly those of Ibn\r\nBawwab, of Ibn Hilal, and of Yakut are for Naskhi. In Egypt and Syria\r\nthe characters used were always more beautiful than those of\r\nAndalusia, which survived in the Mugrib (North of Africa).\r\n\r\nHere, perhaps, it may be stated that the art of Arabic writing came\r\ninto existence but a very short time before Muhammad. 'It was Abu Ali\r\nbin Mukla who first took the present system of written characters from\r\nthe style of writing employed by the people of Kufa, and brought it\r\nout under its actual form. He had, therefore, the merit of priority,\r\nand it may be added that his handwriting was very elegant. But to Ibn\r\nAl Bawwab pertains the honour of rendering the character more regular\r\nand simple, and of clothing it in grace and beauty.' In other words,\r\nIbn Mukla was the first who changed the Kufic into the new Naskhi\r\ncharacter, which Ibn Bawwab improved after him by imparting rotundity\r\nand clearness to the new letters, and which Ibn Yakut Al-Mausili\r\nbrought afterwards to the greatest perfection in A.D. 1200.\r\n\r\nIbn Mukla, who was born in A.D. 885, and died A.D. 941, was vizier to\r\nthe Khalifs Al-Kahir-billah and Al-Radhi-billah; but, falling into\r\ndisfavour through the intrigues of his enemies, he first had his hand\r\ncut off in A.D. 937, and eventually his tongue was torn out, and he\r\nwas allowed to perish in the dungeon without any assistance being\r\noffered to him.\r\n\r\nIbn-al-Bawwab, the Penman, is said to have possessed a skill in\r\npenmanship to which no other person ever attained in ancient or modern\r\ntimes. He died at Baghdad A.D. 1032, and the following verses were\r\ncomposed as his elegy:\r\n\r\n     'Thy loss was felt by the writers of former times, And each\r\n     successive day justifies their grief. The ink-bottles are\r\n     therefore black with sorrow, And the pens are rent through\r\n     affliction.'\r\n\r\nDuring the eleventh century of the Hijrah (A.D. 1592-1689) there lived\r\nMustafa bin Abdullah Katib Jelaby, otherwise known as Haji Khalfa, and\r\ncommonly called Mustafa Haji Khalfa, a man of science as a Turkish\r\nhistorian and geographer, but an Arabic encyclopædist and\r\nbibliographer. He was the compiler of a work containing many thousands\r\nof titles of Arab, Persian, and Turkish books, with the names of their\r\nauthors. Fluegel edited this great work under the title of 'Lexicon\r\nEnciclopædicum et Bibliographicum,' with a Latin translation in seven\r\nbulky volumes, and it is an extremely valuable work of reference, put\r\ntogether with the most astonishing and persevering care, and consulted\r\nby all who desire information on Arabic, Persian, and Turkish\r\nliterature. This was printed by the Oriental Translation Fund between\r\nA.D. 1835 and 1850, and will always remain as one of the most valuable\r\nworks printed by that most useful society, whose extinction must ever\r\nbe regretted by all Orientalists and persons interested in Oriental\r\nliterature. Haji Khalfa wrote another interesting work, giving a\r\ndetailed account of the maritime wars of the Turks in the\r\nMediterranean and Black Sea and on the Danube, which has been\r\ntranslated by Mr. James Mitchell. The date of Haji Khalfa's death is\r\nuncertain. He is known to have been alive in A.D. 1622, and still in\r\n1652, and he is supposed to have died in A.D. 1657.\r\n\r\nThe works of Abul Khair, previously mentioned, and of Haji Khalfa,\r\nembody a mass of information, and constitute the top of the pyramid of\r\nencyclopædical and biographical works, after which nothing worthy of\r\nmention has been written on these subjects. The basis of this pyramid\r\nhad been already laid by An-Nadim, the author of the 'Fihrist,' who\r\nflourished A.D. 987, and by Ibn Khallikan, who died A.D. 1282.\r\n\r\nDuring this century (A.D. 1592-1689) of the most sanguinary wars,\r\nrevolutions and dethronements, the condition of Arab literature in the\r\nOttoman Empire was neither progressive nor satisfactory. Nevertheless,\r\nthe study of the sciences, and especially the linguistic and juridical\r\nbranches of them, were fostered not only in Constantinople, but also\r\nin Syria and Egypt, in consequence of the institution of the body of\r\nUlema, established by Muhammad II., the Conqueror (A.D. 1451-1481),\r\nand improved by Sulaiman I., the Law-giver (A.D. 1520-1566), which\r\nsheltered the cultivation of science from the storms of war within the\r\ninviolable precincts of religion.\r\n\r\nMention may be made of Muhammad-Al-Amin, the learned philologist and\r\nlawyer of Damascus, who was born in that town about the middle of the\r\neleventh and died the beginning of the twelfth century of the Hijrah,\r\nand produced a dozen respectable works, the principal of which bears\r\nthe title of 'The Biographies of the Celebrated Men of the Eleventh\r\nCentury,' A.H. He gives an account of a couple of hundred scholars,\r\nwho represented in Egypt and in Syria the last rays of the setting sun\r\nof Arabian literature.\r\n\r\nNext to Muhammad-Al-Amin another author of about a dozen works is to\r\nbe noticed, namely, Ahmad-Al Makkari, whose principal work was a\r\nhistory of the Muhammadan dynasties in Spain, which was translated\r\nfrom the copies in the library of the British Museum, and illustrated\r\nwith critical notes on Spanish history, geography and antiquities, by\r\nPascual de Gayangos, and printed for the Oriental Translation Fund of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland in A.D. 1840-43. Makkari also wrote a\r\nhistory of Fez and Morocco, as well as an account of Damascus. He\r\ndied at Cairo A.D. 1631.\r\n\r\nBesides some historians, grammarians, philologists and poets, the\r\neleventh century of the Hijrah (A.D. 1592-1689) produced in Syria and\r\nEgypt even astronomers and physicians, who distinguished themselves as\r\nscholars. Of writers of light literature Khafaji may be named as the\r\nchief. He composed a Diwan of ardent love poems, with two anthologies,\r\ncontaining specimens of verses from a couple of poets, his\r\ncontemporaries. He died A.D. 1658. A few more writers might be\r\nmentioned; but their efforts strongly mark the decline of Arabic\r\nliterature in the East, the cultivation of which, however, was\r\nhenceforth more energetically pursued in Europe, where many works have\r\nbeen printed and translated.\r\n\r\nWith the twelfth century of the Hijrah (A.D. 1689-1786) the history of\r\noriginal Arab literature may be said to have terminated, and its\r\ngenius to have disappeared. A revival, however, of Arabian learning is\r\ntaking place in Egypt, Syria, and North Africa, but in accordance with\r\nEuropean models, and chiefly under European auspices. All original\r\nresearch has long been extinct, even among those populations whose\r\nvernacular is the Arabic language; and consequently it is the former,\r\nand not the present state of Arab literature, which is the most\r\ninteresting to the people of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe presses of Constantinople, Cairo, Algiers, Beyruth, and some other\r\nplaces, reproduce old Arabic works of value, but more translations\r\nfrom European languages than original compositions are printed and\r\nlithographed. From Bombay, where more than fifty presses are at work,\r\nlarge quantities of books are exported to countries beyond the British\r\npossessions. These books treat generally of religion, poetry, history,\r\nor medicine; but as they deal more with ancient than with modern\r\nknowledge, they do not tend to propagate progress.\r\n\r\nBut though Arab literature has decayed, the faith of Islam is still\r\nactive and energetic. It is estimated that one hundred and eighty\r\nmillions of human beings still follow the precepts of the Prophet, and\r\ndaily turn their faces to Mecca, which for them has been, and still\r\nis, the cradle of their faith, the touchstone of their religion, and\r\nthe idol of their hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nABOUT MUHAMMAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nA manual of Arabian history and literature would hardly be complete\r\nunless some special mention of Muhammad was introduced. As previously\r\nstated, his Koran forms the basis of the literary edifice of Arab\r\nliterature, while he himself undoubtedly holds the first place in Arab\r\nhistory. As the author and founder of a new religion, which both\r\nduring his lifetime and after his death was accepted with a marvellous\r\nrapidity, and is still being accepted in various parts of Africa, it\r\nmust be admitted that he was an extraordinary person. At the beginning\r\nof what may be called his inspired life at Mecca, he stood forth as a\r\nreformer, preacher, and apostle. But, though full of enthusiasm and\r\nbelief in the great cause that he advocated, he was, without doubt,\r\nfrom the commencement to the end of his career, a practical man of\r\nbusiness, which Buddha and Jesus certainly were not.\r\n\r\nThe life of Muhammad has been written in many languages, and with such\r\nvoluminous details, that it is hardly necessary to enter into these\r\ndetails very minutely here. Sir William Muir's works on the subject\r\nare graphic, descriptive, and full of interesting matter, while a\r\nlengthy article on the subject of Muhammad and Muhammadism, in the\r\nthird volume of the 'Dictionary of Christian Biography,' from the pen\r\nof the late Rev. G.P. Badger, is one of extraordinary interest. A\r\nperusal of the above-named works, with Hughes's 'Dictionary of Islam'\r\nas a reference book, will give the ordinary English reader as much\r\ninformation as is likely to be required in the ordinary course of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nBut by way of preface to certain remarks upon Muhammad as a reformer,\r\npreacher, and apostle at Mecca, as pope and king at Madinah, as author\r\nof the Koran, founder of a religion, legislator, military leader, and\r\norganizer of the Arabs into a nation, it is perhaps necessary to give\r\na rapid summary of the principal events of a life which has had such\r\nan influence upon so many people, and which has filled so many pages.\r\nThis summary will be as brief as possible:\r\n\r\nHis birth, August, A.D. 570, at Mecca, his father having died some\r\nmonths previously.\r\n\r\nHis christening by the name of Muhammad, _i.e._, the Praised One. His\r\ngrandfather Abdul-Muttalib, who gave him the name, said it was given\r\nto him 'in the hope that his grandson would be praised by God in\r\nheaven, and by God's creatures on earth.'\r\n\r\nHis bringing up in the desert of the Benou-Saad by a Badawin nurse,\r\none Halimah, the wife of Harith, for five years.\r\n\r\nHis mother Aminah took him, aged six, to Madinah to present him to his\r\nmaternal relations there. She died on the return journey, A.D. 576.\r\n\r\nUnder the guardianship of his grandfather Abdul Muttalib (who loved\r\nhim dearly) for two years, from six to eight, when Abdul died, A.D.\r\n578.\r\n\r\nUnder the guardianship of his uncle Abu Thaleb, the uterine brother of\r\nhis father, Abd-Allah.\r\n\r\nWhen about twelve years old, Muhammad accompanied his uncle, Abu\r\nThaleb, into Syria on a mercantile expedition. His first visit to that\r\ncountry, and his experiences there, A.D. 582.\r\n\r\nHis presence, during the sacrilegious war, at a battle between certain\r\ntribes at or near Okatz, where he assisted his uncle, who took part in\r\nthe fight.\r\n\r\nHis attendance at sundry preachings and poetical and eloquent\r\nrecitations at Okatz, where it is said he imbibed the first lessons of\r\nthe art of poetry and the power of rhetoric, and also acquired certain\r\nreligious sentiments.\r\n\r\nHis life as a shepherd in the neighbourhood of Mecca, and the ideas\r\nthat such a lonely life, face to face with nature, would perhaps\r\ninspire.\r\n\r\nHis acquisition of the title of Al-Amin, the Trustworthy.\r\n\r\nHis second visit to Syria, when twenty-five years old (A.D. 595), on a\r\nmercantile expedition, as agent to the widow Khadijah, and his\r\nacquisition of religious impressions there.\r\n\r\nHis successful business, and his marriage on his return to Khadijah,\r\nfifteen years his senior in age, A.D. 595.\r\n\r\nSix children born to Muhammad by Khadijah, most of whom died young.\r\n\r\nThe rebuilding of the Kaabah in A.D. 605, in which Muhammad\r\naccidentally takes a prominent part.\r\n\r\nHis solitary contemplations and studies, from the age of twenty-five\r\nto forty, at Mecca, and in the cave on Mount Hira near Mecca.\r\n\r\nHere it is important to bear in mind the foregoing experiences in the\r\nlife of Muhammad as we approach the period of his alleged revelations.\r\nThere can be no doubt that by this time he had acquired, as well\r\nthrough his own observation and inquiry, as through intimate converse\r\nwith Bara-kah, reputed the most learned Arab of the age, considerable\r\nacquaintance with the dogmas of Judaism and Christianity; that he had\r\nsome knowledge of the Bible, the Talmud, and the Gospels; that he was\r\nthoroughly versed in Arab legendary lore, and that, being gifted with\r\na ready flow of speech, an ardent imagination, together with a bold,\r\nenterprising spirit, he was well equipped for carrying out that grand\r\nsocial and religious revolution among his countrymen which he\r\ncontemplated.\r\n\r\nHis yearnings after religious truth and his first poetic productions.\r\n\r\nHis mental depressions.\r\n\r\nHis first inspirations from the angel Gabriel, A.D. 610.\r\n\r\nHis account of his visions to his wife, who became the first convert\r\nto al-Islam, or the creed of Muhammad.\r\n\r\nHis next converts were Ali, his adopted son and cousin;\r\nZaid-bin-Harithah, also an adopted son; Warakah; and\r\nAbdul-Kaabah-bin-Kuhafah, one of the most influential and learned men\r\nof Mecca, on conversion named Abd Allah, and afterwards called Abu\r\nBakr, 'The Father of the Virgin,' 'The Companion of the Cave,' 'The\r\nSecond of the Two,' 'The True,' 'The Sighing,' etc., and who eventually\r\nbecame the first Khalifah, or Successor.\r\n\r\nOther conversions followed; viz., Saad, Zobeir, Talha; Othman bin\r\nAffan, the third Khalifah, or Successor, after Abu Bakr and Omar;\r\nAbdar-Rahman, and several more.\r\n\r\nThe injunctions of Muhammad to his converts were then as follows: 'The\r\nduty of believing in one God; in a future reward reserved for the\r\nrighteous in another life, and a future punishment for the wicked; of\r\nacknowledging himself as the Apostle of God, and of obeying him as\r\nsuch; of practising ablution; of offering up prayer according to\r\ncertain specified rules.' These, he said, did not constitute a new\r\nreligion, but merely restored the ancient religion of Abraham to its\r\npristine purity. His teachings, he maintained, were revelations\r\nconveyed to him by Gabriel, and he simply repeated what the angel\r\ncommunicated to him.\r\n\r\nHis assumption of the title of Apostle of God, in whose name he now\r\nspoke, A.D. 610.\r\n\r\nHis frequent revelations for three years, and the commencement of his\r\npublic preaching to the Koraish, who would not listen, but regarded\r\nhim as a half-witted poet.\r\n\r\nHis denouncement of idolatry, and the consequent persecutions of\r\nhimself and his followers by the Koraish.\r\n\r\nConversions in the house of Arcam, afterwards styled the House of\r\nIslam.\r\n\r\nThe first emigration to Abyssinia of some of his followers by his\r\nadvice, and their speedy return, A.D. 615.\r\n\r\nThe lapse of Muhammad and his idolatrous concession, but afterwards\r\ndisowned and disavowed.\r\n\r\nThe second emigration to Abyssinia, A.D. 615-616.\r\n\r\nThe conversion of Hamzah and Omar and thirty-nine adherents of the\r\nlatter--a great event, A.D. 615-616.\r\n\r\nThe Koraish try to come to terms with Muhammad, but fail.\r\n\r\nThe prohibition of all intercourse with Muhammad and his followers by\r\norder of the Koraish, and a general persecution.\r\n\r\nThe excommunication of Muhammad and of the descendants of Hisham and\r\nMuttalib, which lasted more than three years, A.D. 617-620.\r\n\r\nThe death of Muhammad's first wife, Khadijah, in December, A.D. 619,\r\nand of his uncle, Abu Thaleb, in January, 620.\r\n\r\nHis critical position. He seeks an asylum at Taif, but not being well\r\nreceived, returns to Mecca, remaining there in comparative retirement.\r\n\r\nHis marriage, A.D. 620, with Saudah-bint-Zamaah, the widow of one\r\nSukran, and his betrothal to Ayesha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, then\r\nonly eight years old.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting at the Pilgrimage of a party from Yathrib (Madinah),\r\nto whom Muhammad expounds his doctrines. The listeners profess their\r\nbelief in him, and propose to advocate his cause in their native\r\nplace. March, A.D. 620.\r\n\r\nThe conference at Akabah, a hill on the north side of Mecca, with the\r\nmen of certain tribes resident at Yathrib, who took an oath to be\r\nfaithful to Muhammad and his religion. This is called 'the first\r\npledge of Akabah.' April, A.D. 621.\r\n\r\nThe despatch of Musaab, a Meccan disciple, to Yathrib, for the purpose\r\nof giving instruction in the Koran and in the rites of the new\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe Night of the Ladder, or the miraculous journey first from Mecca to\r\nJerusalem upon the beast called al-Burak, and then the ascent from\r\nJerusalem to heaven, under the guidance of Gabriel, and what he saw\r\nthere. Apparently a dream or vision, A.D. 621.\r\n\r\nSecond meeting at Akabah, called 'the second pledge of Akabah,' and\r\nengagements ratified. March, A.D. 622.\r\n\r\nDistrust of the Koraish. Proposal to kill Muhammad, who had advised\r\nhis followers to flee to Yathrib. April and May, A.D. 622.\r\n\r\nIn June, A.D. 622, Muhammad himself secretly leaves Mecca with Abu\r\nBakr. They first go to a cave in Mount Thur, about three miles to the\r\nsouth of Mecca, and reach Yathrib (henceforward to be called Al\r\nMadinah, 'The City' _par excellence_) a few days afterwards.\r\n\r\nOn his way there, at Kuba, a village two miles to the south of\r\nMadinah, Muhammad laid the foundation of a mosque called 'The Fear of\r\nGod.' This was the first temple raised by Islam.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastic reception at Madinah, a charter drawn up, and Muhammad\r\nassumes the reins of both spiritual and temporal sovereignty.\r\n\r\nHis family arrives from Mecca.\r\n\r\nHe completes his house and mosque at Madinah, and draws up a bond of\r\nunion between the Ansars, or auxiliaries, of Madinah and the Al\r\nMuhajirun, or emigrants from Mecca, who were the first to embrace\r\nIslam.\r\n\r\nMarriage with Ayesha consummated, January, A.D. 623.\r\n\r\nMarriage of Fatimah, Muhammad's daughter, to Ali bin Abu Thaleb, the\r\nadopted son and cousin of Muhammad, June, A.D. 623.\r\n\r\nThe call to prayer; the Kiblah, or place to which the face was turned\r\nin prayer, changed from Jerusalem to Mecca; the fast of Ramadhan, and\r\nthe tithe, or poor rate, instituted. Friday appointed as the day for\r\npublic service in the mosque. Commencement of hostilities with the\r\npeople of Mecca, the first blood shed, and the first booty taken by\r\nthe Muslim.\r\n\r\nBattle of Badr, or Bedr--a victory. January, A.D. 624.\r\n\r\nA Surah, or chapter, issued about 'The Spoils,' how to be divided,\r\nwhich now forms Chapter VIII. of the Koran.\r\n\r\nCommencement of disputes with the Jews, and the exile of the Benou\r\nKainuka, a Jewish tribe settled at Madinah, to Syria.\r\n\r\nAssassination of certain Jews.\r\n\r\nMarriage of Muhammad to Hafsah, the daughter of Omar, on the death of\r\nher husband Khunais, December, A.D. 624. His fourth wife.\r\n\r\nDefeat at Ohud, January, A.D. 625.\r\n\r\nFurther military expeditions.\r\n\r\nThe exile of the Benou Nadhir, another Jewish tribe residing near\r\nMadinah.\r\n\r\nMuhammad marries a fifth wife, Zaineb-bint-Khuzaimah, the widow of\r\nObaidah, slain at Badr.

Muhammad\r\ntakes Rohana, the beautiful Jewess, as a concubine.\r\n\r\nSeveral minor expeditious.\r\n\r\nAn intended pilgrimage to Mecca, but Muhammad, with his followers, do\r\nnot go further than Al-Hodeibiah.\r\n\r\nA truce made with the Koraish for ten years, and permission given to\r\nMuhammad to visit the Kaabah the next year, for three days only.\r\nMarch, A.D. 628.\r\n\r\nLetters sent by Muhammad to foreign sovereigns and princes, inviting\r\nthem to embrace Islam; but these met with a moderate success only.\r\n\r\nExpedition against the Jews of Khaibar, and its complete success.\r\nAugust, A.D. 628.\r\n\r\nMarriage of Muhammad with Safiyyah, the bride of Kinanah, his ninth\r\nwife, August, A.D. 628. He partakes of a poisoned kid, dressed and\r\noffered to him by a woman named Zeinab.\r\n\r\nHis marriage with Omm Habiba, widow of Obaid Allah, and daughter of\r\nAbu Sofyan, October, A.D. 628. His tenth wife.\r\n\r\nHe takes Mary, the Coptic maid, as a concubine, sent to him by Jarih\r\nbin Mutta, the Governor of Egypt.\r\n\r\nThere were now nine wives and two concubines living in the harem of\r\nthe Prophet.\r\n\r\nSeveral small expeditions.\r\n\r\nDespatch of further letters to foreign potentates and princes.\r\n\r\nHis pilgrimage to Mecca for three days, as previously stipulated, and\r\nknown as the 'Solemn visit of the Fulfilment.'

The Christians designated Jesus\r\nChrist as the Son of God, and the Second Person in the Trinity.\r\nMuhammad denied this, quoting the following from the Koran:\r\n\r\n'Jesus, the son of Mary, is only an apostle of God, and His word,\r\nwhich He conveyed into Mary, and a spirit proceeding from Himself.\r\nBelieve, therefore, in God and His apostle, and say not three.\r\nForbear; it will be better for you. God is only one God. Far be it\r\nfrom His glory that He should have a son.'\r\n\r\nDeputations from certain Arab tribes.\r\n\r\nSeveral lesser expeditions.\r\n\r\nCampaign of Tabuk, which ended without fighting, and the submission of\r\nmany tribes, October, A.D. 630.\r\n\r\nDefinite establishment of the Muslim Empire, A.D. 631.\r\n\r\nExpedition of Ali to Yaman, December, A.D. 631.\r\n\r\nMuhammad's solemn and greater pilgrimage to Mecca, i.e. 'the Al-Hijj,'\r\nor the Greater Pilgrimage, as compared with 'the Umrah,' or Lesser\r\nPilgrimage.

His establishment of the lunar year, and his\r\nfarewell addresses.\r\n\r\nIndisposition of Muhammad, and the three revolts--one headed by\r\nTulaihah bin Khuwailid, a famous warrior of Najd; one by Musailamah;\r\nand one by Al-Aswad, all of which were eventually completely crushed\r\nafter Muhammad's death by Abu Bakr and his generals.\r\n\r\nAnother expedition to Syria projected.\r\n\r\nMuhammad's health becomes worse. His retirement to Ayesha's apartment.\r\nHis final discourses.\r\n\r\nAbu Bakr appointed to lead the public prayers.\r\n\r\nMuhammad's last appearance in the mosque at Madinah.\r\n\r\nHis death and burial, June, A.D. 632.\r\n\r\nFrom the above summary of the principal events of Muhammad's life, it\r\nwill be perceived that up to the age of forty he was a student and\r\nacquirer of knowledge, much alone and occupied with his thoughts. At\r\nforty-one he began his public ministry, and stood forth as a reformer,\r\npreacher, and apostle at Mecca, and this continued till he finally\r\nleft that place, in June, A.D. 622. As a reformer he proposed to do\r\naway with idols, to suppress gambling and drinking, and to abolish\r\nfemale infanticide, at that time much practised by the Arabs. As a\r\npreacher and apostle he urged the people to accept the belief in one\r\nGod, whose injunctions were communicated to him by Gabriel for the\r\nbenefit of the humanities. Prayer and ablution were also then\r\nordained; fasting, almsgiving, and pilgrimages were instituted later\r\non.\r\n\r\nBefore Muhammad's time there had been several earnest seekers after\r\nthe one God, the God of Abraham. Of these persons Zaid, the Inquirer,\r\nmay be mentioned, as also Warakah, a cousin of Muhammad's first wife,\r\nKhadijah; Othman bin Huwairith, and Obaid Allah bin Jahsh. The people\r\nwho professed this theism were termed Hanyfs; but their state of mind\r\nwas as yet a purely speculative one, and they had announced nothing\r\ndefinite. But the ground was so far laid open, and had been prepared\r\nto a certain extent for Muhammad and his express revelation, that\r\n'There was no God but the God, and that Muhammad was His apostle.'\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that when Muhammad first began his public\r\nexhortations he had a strong idea of bringing not only the Arabs, but\r\nalso the Jews and Christians, into his fold, and establishing one\r\nuniversal faith on the basis of one God, Almighty, Eternal, Merciful,\r\nCompassionate. It was on this account that he made Jerusalem the Kiblah,\r\nor consecrated direction of worship, and introduced into the Suras, or\r\nchapters, that he issued from time to time a good deal of matter\r\nconnected with our Old and New Testaments. He particularly mentioned\r\nAbraham as the Father of the Faith, and acknowledging that there had\r\nalready existed many thousand prophets, and three hundred and fifteen\r\napostles, or messengers, he quoted nine of these last as special\r\nmessengers, viz., Noah, Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Job, David,\r\nJesus, the son of Mary, and himself. To five of these he gave special\r\ntitles. He called Noah the preacher of God; Abraham the friend of God;\r\nMoses the converser with God; Jesus the spirit of God; and himself the\r\napostle, or messenger, of God. But of the nine above mentioned four\r\nonly, viz., Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad, held the highest rank as\r\nprophet-apostles.\r\n\r\nIt would, therefore, appear that Muhammad really hoped to establish\r\none religion, acknowledging one God and a future life, and admitting\r\nthat the earlier prophets had emanated from God as apostles or\r\nmessengers. The world was too young and too ignorant in Muhammad's\r\ntime to accept such an idea. It may, however, be accepted some day,\r\nwhen knowledge overcomes prejudice. Nations may have different habits,\r\nmanners, and customs, but the God they all worship is one and the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nMuhammad's life, from the age of forty to fifty, was one long struggle\r\nwith the Koraish. Had it not been for the support given him by some of\r\nhis influential relations at Mecca, he would either have been killed,\r\nor compelled to leave the place before he did. It is true that during\r\nthese twelve years he made some excellent converts and faithful\r\nfollowers; but still it must be regarded as an historical fact that\r\nMuhammad failed at Mecca, as Jesus had failed at Jerusalem. In the one\r\ncase Jesus was sacrificed, and passed away, leaving the story of His\r\nlife, His words and His works in the heads of His disciples, who, with\r\nthe suddenly converted Paul, certain Alexandrian Jews, the Emperor\r\nConstantine, some literary remains of Plato, along with a destruction\r\nof adverse manuscripts and documents, finally established the\r\nChristian religion. In the other case Muhammad, failing at Mecca,\r\nsucceeded at Madinah, and before his death had so far settled matters\r\nthat the religion was fairly established, and was thus saved the\r\nsevere and bitter struggles of the first centuries of the Christian\r\nChurches.\r\n\r\nIt has seldom been a matter of speculation as to what would have been\r\nthe course of the world's history if Muhammad had been slain by the\r\nKoraish before he left Mecca, or if Jesus had not been crucified by\r\nthe Jews. It is probable that in the end both religions would have\r\nbeen eventually established in other ways, and by other means,\r\ndepending a good deal on the followers of the two men. But as the\r\nsubject is purely speculative, it can hardly be entertained in this\r\npurely historical chapter.\r\n\r\nOnce at Madinah, Muhammad became a personage. Supported by his Meccan\r\nfollowers (al-Muhâjirûn), and the Madinese auxiliaries (Ansârs), he\r\nassumed immediately a spiritual and temporal authority, and became a\r\nsort of Pope-King. He kept that position for the rest of his life,\r\nimproving it by his military successes, his diplomatic arrangements,\r\nhis spiritual instructions, and his social legislation.\r\n\r\nIt was probably shortly before he went to Madinah, or very soon after\r\nhis arrival there, that he gave up all ideas of bringing over Jews,\r\nChristians, and Sabæans to his views. He determined to adapt them to\r\nthe manners and customs of the Arabs only. In this he showed his\r\nwisdom and his knowledge of business. He changed the Kiblah from\r\nJerusalem to Mecca. In the place of the Jewish trumpet, or the\r\nChristian bell, he introduced the call to prayer still heard from the\r\ntapering minarets of every mosque throughout the Muhammadan world.\r\n\r\nBy the Christian world it has been sometimes considered that Muhammad\r\nwas good and virtuous at Mecca, but vicious and wicked at Madinah.\r\nSuch calls to mind the reply of an Indian youth when asked in an\r\nexamination to give an outline of the character of our good Queen\r\nElizabeth. He briefly described her as 'a great and virtuous princess,\r\nbut in her old age she became dissolute, and had a lover called\r\nEssex.'\r\n\r\nBut the position of Muhammad at Madinah was entirely different to what\r\nit had been at Mecca. At the latter place he was unable to assert\r\nhimself. Indeed, it was as much as he could do to keep himself and his\r\nfollowers going at all, constantly subject as they were to persecution\r\nfrom the Koraish. All this was changed at Madinah, and his ten years\r\nrule there was remarkable for his various military expeditions, his\r\norganization of the different tribes, his bitter persecution of the\r\nJews, his still-continued inspired utterances, which now included\r\nspiritual, social, and legal matters, and his repeated marriages.\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently said that Muhammad, in his virtuous days, was\r\ncontent with one wife at Mecca, but in his vicious days at Madinah he\r\nhad ten wives and two concubines. As a matter of fact, after\r\nKhadijah's death Muhammad's marriages were in most cases more or less\r\na matter of business. By them he allied himself to Abu Bakr, Omar, Abu\r\nSofyan, Khalid bin Walid, and other important persons. He further\r\nmarried the widows of some of his followers killed in battle, perhaps\r\n'pour encourager les autres.' It is also probable that he was very\r\nanxious to have children, all of his having died except Fatima, who\r\nwas married to Ali.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be admitted that Muhammad had a weakness for\r\nwomen in his later years--witness the case of Zainab bint Jahsh, the\r\nJewish concubine Rohana, and the Coptic maid Mary. Indeed, his\r\nfavourite wife Ayesha used to say of him: 'The Prophet loved three\r\nthings--women, scents, and food; he had his heart's desire of the two\r\nfirst, but not of the last,' The reasons for this want of food, and\r\nmany other traditions connected with the character of Muhammad, are to\r\nbe found in the last chapter and the supplement at the end of Sir\r\nWilliam Muir's most excellent and interesting work on the life of this\r\nextraordinary man, who, if author of the Koran only, would be\r\nentitled to rank among the immortals.\r\n\r\nAccording to Muslim orthodox theology, the Koran is the inspired Word\r\nof God, uncreated, and eternal in its original essence. 'He who says\r\nthe word of God is created is an infidel,' such is the decree of\r\nMuhamniadan doctrine. Leaving everybody to form their own opinion on\r\nsuch a matter, it is only necessary here briefly to allude to the\r\nwork, and to suppose that Muhammad was the inspired author of it.\r\n\r\nThe Koran is divided into 114 suras, or chapters, and 6,666 verses.\r\nThe word itself signifies reading or recitation, and Muhammad always\r\nasserted that he only recited what had been repeated to him. But the\r\nKoran represents Muhammad from many points of view, in different\r\ncapacities, and under different necessities. Ayesha, his favourite\r\nwife, when asked in later years as a widow to relate something about\r\nthe Prophet, replied: 'Have you not the Koran, and have you not read\r\nit? for that will tell you everything about him.'\r\n\r\nThe Koran was not collected or arranged until after Muhammad's death.\r\nIt is to be regretted that there is no reliable record of the exact\r\norder in which its various verses and chapters were given to the world\r\nby the Prophet, as that would have given us a great insight into the\r\nworking of his mind from the time that he began his first recitals up\r\nto the time of his death. It is true that attempts have been made to\r\nformulate the order of delivery, but these can only be more or less\r\nconjecture. At the same time, though earlier and later verses appear\r\nmixed up in the different chapters, in some cases, of course, the\r\nperiod to which they belong can be pretty accurately fixed and\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nAs an interesting work, it can hardly be compared with our Old and New\r\nTestaments, nor would it be fair to make such a comparison. It must be\r\nremembered that the Koran is the work of Muhammad alone, while the\r\nBiblos, or Book, commonly called the Bible, is the work of many men.\r\nIn its compilation many authors were rejected, and it represents as a\r\nwhole the united talents of the ages. Indeed, the Bible may be\r\nconsidered as the most wonderful book in existence, and certainly the\r\nmost interesting after visiting the countries it describes and the\r\nlocalities it refers to. If read from a matter-of-fact point of view,\r\nit gives an abundance of various kinds of literature, and describes\r\nthe workings of the human mind from the earliest ages, and the\r\nprogress of ideas as they gradually and slowly dawned upon man and\r\ndrove him onwards. If read from a spiritual or mystical point of view,\r\nit can be interpreted in many ways to meet the views of either the\r\nreaders or the hearers. In a word, the Bible is full of prose and\r\npoetry, fact and imagination, history and fiction. It was lately\r\ndescribed in an Italian newspaper, _Il Secolo_, about to issue a\r\npopular edition of it in halfpenny numbers, as follows:\r\n\r\n'There is one book which gathers up the poetry and the science of\r\nhumanity, and that book is the Bible; and with this book no other work\r\nin any literature can be compared. It is a book that Newton read\r\ncontinually, that Cromwell carried at his saddle, and that Voltaire\r\nkept always on his study table. It is a book that believers and\r\nunbelievers should alike study, and that ought to be found in every\r\nhouse.'\r\n\r\nAs a scientific work it has little value except that it represents the\r\nextent of scientific knowledge possessed by the authors at the time\r\nthe different books were written.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Koran, which may, then, be regarded as the Bible of\r\nthe Muslims. According to Mr. Badger: 'It embodies the utterances of\r\nthe Arabian Prophet on all subjects, religious and moral,\r\nadministrative and judicial, political and diplomatic, from the outset\r\nto the close of his career, together with a complete code of laws for\r\nregulating marriage, divorce, guardianship of orphans, bargains,\r\nwills, evidence, usury, and the intercourse of private and domestic\r\nlife, as they were dictated by him to his secretaries, and by them\r\ncommitted to writing on palm-leaves, the shoulder-blades of sheep, and\r\nother tablets. These, it appears, were thrown pell-mell into chests,\r\nwhere they remained till the reign of Abu Bakr, the immediate\r\nsuccessor of Muhammad, who, during the first year of his Khalifate,\r\nentrusted Zaid-bin Harithah, an Ansar, or auxiliary, and one of the\r\namanuenses of the Prophet, with the task of collecting them together,\r\nwhich he did, as well from \"the breasts of men\" as from the\r\nafore-named materials, meaning thereby that he availed himself of the\r\nmemories of those who had committed parts of the Prophet's utterances\r\nto memory. [Tradition states that one of the contemporary Muslims had\r\nlearnt as many as seventy chapters by heart.] Zaid's copy continued to\r\nbe the standard text during the Khalifate of Abu Bakr, who committed\r\nit to the keeping of Hafsah, one of Muhammad's widows. Certain\r\ndisputes having arisen regarding this text, owing mainly to the\r\nvariations of dialect and punctuation occurring therein, Omar, the\r\nsuccessor of Abu Bakr, in the tenth year of his Khalifate, determined\r\nto establish a text which should be the sole standard, and delegated\r\nto Zaid, with whom he associated several eminent Arab scholars of the\r\nAl-Koraish, the task of its reduction. On its completion copies were\r\nforwarded to the principal stations of the empire, and all previously\r\nexisting copies were submitted to the flames. This is the text now in\r\ngeneral use among Muslims, and there is every reason to believe it to\r\nbe a faithful rescript of the original fragmentary collection, amended\r\nonly in its dialectical variations, and made conformable to the purer\r\nArabic of the Al-Koraish, in which the contents of the Koran were\r\nannounced by Muhammad.'\r\n\r\nFrom a literary point of view the Koran is regarded as a specimen of\r\nthe purest Arabic, and written in half poetry and half prose. It has\r\nbeen said that in some cases grammarians have adapted their rules to\r\nagree with certain phrases and expressions used in it, and that though\r\nseveral attempts have been made to produce a work equal to it, as far\r\nas elegant writing is concerned, none have as yet succeeded.\r\n\r\nWith the Koran, then, as a basis to work upon, Muhammad became the\r\nauthor and, it may be said, also founder of the Muhammadan faith,\r\nalthough as regards the foundation of any religion the followers of\r\nthe author are generally the real founders of his faith. Of the three\r\nauthors of great religions, viz., Moses, Buddha, and Jesus, who had\r\ngone before, Moses seems to have had much in common with Muhammad, and\r\nthe two resembled each other in some ways. Buddha and Jesus were, on\r\nthe other hand, entirely spiritualistic, their ideas on many subjects\r\nmuch the same, and their preachings and teachings run together very\r\nmuch on parallel lines.\r\n\r\nThe connecting links, however, between Buddhism and Christianity, if\r\nany, have yet to be discovered and determined. It may happen that some\r\nday further light may be thrown upon the subject; but at present, in\r\nspite of similarity of ideas, of sentiments, and of parables in the\r\ntwo religions, there is no positive proof of any connection between\r\nthem, except that one preceded the other. While history has recorded\r\nevery detail of Muhammad's life, both before and after his public\r\nministry, which did not begin until he was forty years of age,\r\nhistory, alas! gives us no detailed record of the life of Jesus prior\r\nto the commencement of His public ministry in His thirtieth year. Had\r\nHe travelled Himself to the further East? Had He studied under\r\nBuddhist missionaries? Had He taken the vows of poverty, chastity, and\r\nobedience, before He was baptized by John the Essene? Had He anything\r\nto do with the sects called Essenes, Therapeuts, Gnostics, Nazarites,\r\nthe Brethren, which existed both before and during His lifetime?\r\nThese, and many other questions which might be asked, can now probably\r\nnever be answered, and the only thing that can be confidently asserted\r\nis that the character and the spiritual teachings of Christ, as handed\r\ndown to us, much resemble the character and spiritual teachings of\r\nBuddha.\r\n\r\nA few paragraphs must be devoted to Moses and Muhammad, as the first\r\norganizers of the Jews and the Arabs into separate and distinct\r\nnationalities. The two men had very different material to work upon,\r\nbut they succeeded with the aid of Eloah, or Allah, supporting their\r\nown efforts.\r\n\r\nIt is probably historically true that the good old patriarch Abraham\r\nonce lived, and may be considered to be the father of the Jewish,\r\nChristian, and Muhammadan religions. According to Arab tradition,\r\nAbraham, assisted by Ishmael, built the Kaabah at Mecca, so called\r\nbecause it was nearly a kaabah, or square. Anyhow, Abraham has ever\r\nbeen regarded with the greatest veneration by the Muslims, and his\r\ntomb at Hebron at the present day is so jealously guarded by them that\r\nthe Jews and the Christians are not permitted to enter its sacred\r\nprecincts.\r\n\r\nAbraham and his followers worshipped Eloah, or the Almighty God, as\r\nthe one and only God, offering up to Him at times various sacrifices.\r\nAccording to Rénan, in his 'History of the People of Israel,' 'the\r\nprimitive religion of Israel was the worship of the Elohim, a\r\ncollective name for the invisible forces that govern the world, and\r\nwhich are vaguely conceived as forming a supreme power at once single\r\nand manifold.'\r\n\r\n'This vague primitive monotheism got modified during the migrations of\r\nthe children of Israel, and especially during their struggles for the\r\nconquest of Palestine, and at last gave place to the conception of\r\nJahveh, a national God conceived after the fashion of the gods of\r\npolytheism, essentially anthropomorphic, the God of Israel in conflict\r\nwith the gods of the surrounding nations.'\r\n\r\n'It was the task of the prophets to change this low and narrow\r\nconception of the Deity for a nobler one, to bring back the Jews to\r\nthe Elohistic idea in a spiritualized form, and to transform the\r\nJahveh or Jehovah of the times of the Judges into a God of all the\r\nearth--universal, one and absolute, that God in spirit and in truth of\r\nwhom Jesus, the last of the prophets, completed the revelation.'\r\n\r\nCertain events in the life of Joseph brought the family of Jacob to\r\nEgypt, separated it from the other tribes, and made the Israelites\r\ninto a peculiar people.[5] As the twelve families of the sons of Jacob\r\nexpanded into twelve tribes, they grew in number to such an extent\r\nthat the Egyptian Government of the day began to be alarmed, and\r\ncommenced coercive proceedings, which led to the appearance of Moses,\r\nfirst as a liberator, and then as the organizer of the twelve tribes\r\ninto a Jewish nationality.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 5: The actual dates of these events and of the\r\n     exodus from Egypt have not yet been historically fixed. How\r\n     the Israelites first migrated to the land of Goshen, and how\r\n     they eventually left Egypt, is still a question of\r\n     considerable controversy. Further discoveries may yet throw\r\n     further light on the subject.]\r\n\r\nWhen Moses first took the children of Israel out of Egypt, it was\r\nprobably his intention to lead them at once to the promised land.\r\nFinding, however, that their physical strength and courage was not\r\nequal to the conquest of Canaan, he kept them in the desert for forty\r\nyears, until the open-air life and the hardy fare had produced a new\r\ngeneration of men fit to cope with the warriors of the land they were\r\nabout to attempt to conquer.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, during this residence in the desert Moses legislated both\r\nmorally and socially for the Jews, as Muhammad did for the Arabs at\r\nMadinah. But as the Koran was not put together during Muhammad's\r\nlifetime, so it is also highly probable that the Pentateuch, or five\r\nbooks of Moses, were not collected and collated till some time after\r\nhis death, which last is described in the work itself.[6] Indeed, many\r\nthings mentioned in them show a more advanced state of civilization\r\nthan the children of Israel enjoyed during their wanderings in the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 6: This subject is treated at considerable length\r\n     by Dr. A. Kuenen in 'The Religion of Israel,' translated by\r\n     Alfred Heath May from the Dutch. Williams and Norgate:\r\n     London, 1882.]\r\n\r\nBut, still, to Moses the Jews owe their nationality, as the Arabs owed\r\ntheirs to Muhammad. The former found a weak people, united to a\r\ncertain extent, but quite unaccustomed to fighting and hardship, and\r\nhe welded them sufficiently together to enable them, under his\r\nsuccessors, to establish themselves in the promised land. The latter\r\nfound Arabia inhabited by a quantity of tribes, more or less hostile\r\nto each other, but brave to a degree; fond of fighting and plundering,\r\nand always at it; full of local jealousies and internal enmities,\r\nwhich kept them separate. Muhammad not only induced them to believe in\r\none God, but also brought them together to such, an extent that his\r\nsuccessors were able to launch them as united warriors and conquerors\r\nthroughout the East, and to found an empire for the time being far\r\ngreater, grander, and more important than Canaan, as divided among the\r\ntwelve tribes, or the dominions of David and Solomon.\r\n\r\nAs a military leader Muhammad was not particularly celebrated. The\r\nmilitary expeditions undertaken by him in person are variously stated\r\nto have been from nineteen to twenty-seven in number, whilst those in\r\nwhich he was not present are stated to have amounted to more than\r\nfifty. With the exception of one or two to the Syrian frontier, they\r\nwere chiefly directed against the Arabs and the Jews in Arabia, but\r\nnone of them were of the magnitude of those undertaken by his\r\nsuccessors, Abu Bakr and Omar, who, with the aid of the generals\r\nKhalid, son of Walid, Mothanna, Amr bin Al'Aasi, and others, made\r\ngreat conquests, and finally established the Muslim faith on a firm\r\nand lasting basis. The details of these successes are admirably told\r\nin Muir's 'Annals of the Early Khalifate.'\r\n\r\nThere appears to be a great resemblance between many of the military\r\nand warlike expeditions undertaken by Muhammad in Arabia, and those of\r\nthe Jews, as narrated in the historical works of the Old Testament, in\r\nPalestine. In both countries God was used as the authority, and\r\nindividuals and tribes were attacked and slaughtered much in the same\r\nway. Indeed, if the numbers slain, as recorded by the Jewish\r\nhistorians, are to be depended upon, it can only be inferred that the\r\nGod of the Jews was more vindictive and bloodthirsty than the God of\r\nthe Arabs. At the present time the Soudanese and their Khalifahs seem\r\nto be following very much in the steps of Muhammad, constantly sending\r\nforth military expeditions, and issuing letters to foreign potentates.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the dogmas and precepts of Islam, as embodied in the\r\nKoran, may be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n  (1) Belief in Allah or God, or, more correctly, 'The God;' that is,\r\nthe only God. 'Al,' the; 'Ilah,' a God.\r\n\r\n  (2) Belief in the Messengers or Angels.\r\n\r\n  (3) Belief in the Books or Scriptures, and in the Prophets.\r\n\r\n  (4) Belief in Hell and Paradise.\r\n\r\n  (5) Belief in a general resurrection and final judgment.\r\n\r\n  (6) Belief in the decrees of God, or of His having absolutely\r\npredestined both good and evil.\r\n\r\nThe five cardinal ordinances of Islam are:\r\n\r\n  (1) The pious recitation of the Kalimah, or Creed: 'There is no God\r\nbut the one God, and Muhammad is his Apostle.'\r\n\r\n  (2) Prayer.\r\n\r\n  (3) Fasting.\r\n\r\n  (4) Legal and obligatory almsgiving.\r\n\r\n  (5) Pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nThere are several other points connected with the institutions of\r\nIslam, such as--\r\n\r\n  (1) Circumcision.\r\n\r\n  (2) Marriage and polygamy.\r\n\r\n  (3) Slavery.\r\n\r\n  (4) The Jihad, or Holy War.\r\n\r\n  (5) Food, drink and ablutions.\r\n\r\nBut full details connected with the above will be found, if required,\r\nin Hughes 'Dictionary of Islam,' so that further reference to them\r\nhere is unnecessary. It must, however, always be remembered that faith\r\nand prayer were the two points which Muhammad always insisted upon as\r\nabsolutely essential.\r\n\r\nThe Muhammadan religion may be regarded as creating in theory the\r\npurest democracy in existence. All men are supposed to be equal. There\r\nare no hereditary titles. Every man can rise, either by interest or\r\ntalent, from the very lowest to the very highest position. There is a\r\nuniversal feeling of brotherhood among the Muslims. All this is\r\nexcellent in theory, but in practice the ways of the world are\r\ndifferent. A Pasha holds his place and upholds his position, while a\r\nhumble follower of the said Pasha, or other person in an inferior\r\nposition, knows his place also, and treats his superiors and his\r\ninferiors accordingly. In fact, both in the East and the West there\r\nappears to be a place for all men, and that place is established by\r\nthe unwritten laws of the world or by the law of nature, in spite of\r\nthe many theories propounded by religion, politics, or political\r\neconomy. Still, Muhammad himself instilled equality among his\r\nfollowers, and in his parting address at Mina, at the time of the\r\nfarewell pilgrimage, spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n'Ye people! hearken to my speech and comprehend the same. Know that\r\nevery Muslim is the brother of every other Muslim. All of you are on\r\nthe same equality' (and as he pronounced these words he raised his\r\narms aloft and placed the forefinger of one hand on the forefinger of\r\nthe other, intending thereby to signify that all were absolutely on\r\nthe same level); 'ye are one brotherhood.\r\n\r\n'Know ye what month this is? What territory is this? What day?' To\r\neach question the people gave the appropriate answer, viz.:\r\n\r\n'The sacred month, the sacred territory, the great day of pilgrimage.'\r\nAfter every one of these replies Muhammad added:\r\n\r\n'Even thus sacred and inviolable hath God made the life and the\r\nproperty of each of you unto the other, until ye meet your Lord.\r\n\r\n'Let him that is present tell it unto him that is absent. Haply, he\r\nthat shall be told may remember better than he who hath heard it.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTALES AND STORIES.\r\n\r\nOf the two hundred and fifty books of tales, the titles of which are\r\ngiven in the 'Fihrist,' only three or four have attained European\r\nfame. Firstly, the book known in Arabic as 'Kalilah wa Dimnah,'\r\ncontaining the celebrated Indian apologues, or the so-called fables of\r\nBidpay, on the origin of which several dissertations have been\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nIn 'Early Ideas' (W.H. Allen and Co., 1881) mention was made of the\r\nfables of Bidpay, or Pilpai, as being the traditionally oldest-known\r\ncollection of stories in Hindustan, and that from them the 'Pancha\r\nTantra,' or 'Five Chapters,' and the 'Hitopodesa,' or 'Friendly\r\nAdvice,' are supposed to have been drawn.\r\n\r\nIn 'Persian Portraits' (Quaritch, 1887) it was noted that the Persian\r\nwork called 'Kalilah wa Dimnah' is said to have been originally\r\nderived from the fables of Bidpay, and that it led to the longer and\r\nlarger works known in Persian literature as the 'Anwar-i-Suheli,' or\r\n'The Lights of Canopos,' and the 'Ayar-Danish,' or 'The Touchstone of\r\nKnowledge.'\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that this work of 'Kalilah wa Dimnah'\r\n(translated from Persian into Arabic by Ibn Al-Mukaffa about A.D.\r\n750), and another Persian work, not now extant, but known as the\r\n'Hazar Afsaneh,' or 'Thousand Stories,' were the first sources from\r\nwhich were commenced to be compiled the best collection of tales and\r\nstories in Arabic literature, and called 'The Thousand and One\r\nNights,' and popularly known in this country as 'The Arabian Nights.'\r\n\r\nAs regards the 'Hazar Afsaneh,' or 'Thousand Stories,' it is much to\r\nbe regretted that all trace of this work has disappeared. It is,\r\nhowever, mentioned by Masudi, and An-Nadim, the author of the\r\n'Fihrist,' but whether they had actually seen and perused the whole\r\nwork is uncertain. It may have been completed during the rule of the\r\nSasanian dynasty in Persia (A.D. 228-641), some of whose kings were\r\npatrons of letters, and the work, or portions of it, may have been\r\ndestroyed along with a large quantity of other Persian literature at\r\nthe time of the conquest of the Persian Empire by the Arabs in A.D.\r\n641. At all events, it has not yet been found, though it is still\r\nhoped that it may turn up some day.\r\n\r\nAs regards the 'Nights' themselves, it is impossible to fix any exact\r\ndate to them, neither can they be ascribed to any particular authors.\r\nFrom the book as it has come down to us; there is ample evidence to\r\nassert that the collection of all the tales and stories occupied many\r\nyears, and that the authors of them were numerous. As great progress\r\nwas made in Arab literature from the commencement of the rule of the\r\nAbbaside dynasty in A.D. 750, it maybe inferred that the work itself\r\ndates from that period, and that it had been put together in a certain\r\nform before the fall of Baghdad in A.D. 1258. After that date other\r\nstories were probably added, and the whole répertoire was perhaps put\r\ntogether again in its present shape either at Cairo or Damascus, with\r\nnumerous alterations and additions.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the fables and apologues are the oldest part of\r\nthe book. These bear on their face a decided impress of the Farther\r\nEast; indeed, they are quite of the nature of the stories told in the\r\n'Pancha Tantra,' 'Kathá Sarit Ságara,' 'Hitopodesa,' and 'Kalilah wa\r\nDirnnah,' many of them being either the same, or bearing a very great\r\nresemblance to them. Animal fables generally may have originated in\r\nIndia, where the doctrine of metempsychosis obtains currency to this\r\nday; but, still, Egypt, Greece, and other countries, have also\r\nproduced stories of the same nature. From the time of the early\r\nEgyptians, the fable has ever been the means of conveyance of both\r\ninstruction and amusement to mankind. And as years rolled by the fable\r\ngrew into the tale or story, which later on expanded into the romance\r\nand the novel.\r\n\r\nAfter the fables the oldest tales in the 'Nights' are supposed to be\r\nthe Sindibad, or the tale of the king, his son, his concubine, and the\r\nseven wazirs; and that of King Jali'ad of Hind, and his wazir Shimas,\r\nfollowed by the history of King Wird Khan, son of King Jali'ad, with\r\nhis women and wazirs. These tales have also an Indian flavour about\r\nthem, both with regard to the animal stories in them and to the\r\nsapient remarks about the duties of kings and their ministers, often\r\nreferred to in the Kathá Sarit Ságara, of which more anon.\r\n\r\nThe remaining tales and stories in the 'Nights' may be of Persian,\r\nArabian, Egyptian, and Syrian origin, some earlier and some later. The\r\nadventures of Kamar Al-Zaman and the jeweller's wife, and of Ma'aruf,\r\nthe cobbler, and his wife Fatimah, are considered to be two of the\r\nvery latest stories, having been assigned to the sixteenth century.\r\nThe story of Aboukir, the dyer, and Abousir, the barber, is quoted by\r\nPayne 'as the most modern of the whole collection.'\r\n\r\nCertain stories of the 'Nights' were first introduced to Europe,\r\nbetween 1704-1708, by Antoine Galland, a Frenchman, whose biography is\r\ngiven by Burton in his 'Terminal Essay,' vol. x., and most interesting\r\nit is. The work of the translation of Arabic and Persian stories was\r\ncontinued by Petis de la Croix (1710-12), Morell (1765), Dow (1768),\r\nChavis and Cazotte (1787-89), Caussin de Perceval (1806), Gauttier\r\n(1822), Jonathan Scott (1811), Von Hammer Purgstall (1823), Zinzerling\r\n(1823-24), Trebutien (1828), Habicht (1825-39), Weil (1838-42),\r\nTorrens (1838), Lane (1838-40), and the 'Nights' themselves have now\r\nbeen completely finished by John Payne (1882-84) and Richard Burton\r\n(1885-88).\r\n\r\nA perusal of the productions of all the translators above mentioned\r\nwill show that, as regards finality, both Payne and Burton have done\r\ntheir work completely, thoroughly, and exhaustively, and for all time,\r\nas far as an English translation is concerned. Too much credit cannot\r\nbe given to these two gentlemen for their untiring labour and energy.\r\nThe more the 'Nights' are read, the more will people appreciate the\r\namount of hard work and acumen, intelligence and ability, which has\r\nbeen thrown into the undertaking by these two accomplished\r\nlittérateurs. And it is highly probable that their translations, along\r\nwith Galland's volumes in French, will ever remain as the standard\r\nEuropean versions of this great series of Oriental tales.\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit of a lengthy description of all that is\r\ncontained in Payne's thirteen, and in Burton's sixteen, volumes. To be\r\nappreciated thoroughly, they must be read, like Balzac's works, from\r\nthe very beginning to the very end. At the same time a brief analysis\r\nof these two translations of the 'Nights' may perhaps be interesting,\r\nand will serve the purposes of the present chapter.\r\n\r\nThe first nine of Payne's, and the first ten of Burton's, volumes are\r\ndevoted to the 'Nights' proper, and follow the same lines. The\r\ntranslation has been made from what are commonly known as the Boulac\r\n(Cairo) and the two Calcutta Arabic texts of the 'Nights,' though\r\nreferences are made to the Breslau (Tunis) edition, from which also\r\nsome extracts have been taken and some translations made. The contents\r\nof these volumes may be divided into four heads:\r\n\r\n  (1) Fables and apologues.\r\n\r\n  (2) Short stories and anecdotes, some biographical and historical.\r\n\r\n  (3) Tales and stories.\r\n\r\n  (4) Long stories, or romances.\r\n\r\nExcluding the two short stories in the introductory chapter, there are\r\n10 principal and 6 subordinate fables under the first heading, 116\r\nprincipal and 3 subordinate stories under the second, 38 principal and\r\n75 subordinate under the third, and 6 principal and 12 subordinate\r\nunder the fourth heading. This gives a total of 170 principal and 96\r\nsubordinate stories in Burton's edition, while Payne gives one\r\nprincipal story and one subordinate one less, his numbers being 169\r\nand 95 respectively. By principal is meant the main or chief story,\r\nwhile by subordinate is meant another story forming part of the main\r\nstory. In Oriental literature this custom is frequently introduced. A\r\nstory is commenced, but owing to some allusion in it another story is\r\ninterpolated, and when this is finished, the original tale is reverted\r\nto, only, perhaps, to be interpolated again by another story, and so\r\non.\r\n\r\nOut of this mass of fable, tale and story, it is difficult to select\r\nany particular ones that may prove interesting to everybody. Some are\r\nvery good, others good, some fairish, and others indifferent; but all\r\nare more or less interesting, as they deal with all sorts and\r\nconditions of men and women, and all sorts of events and situations.\r\nPersonally, some twelve stories have struck me as particularly\r\ninteresting or amusing, though it does not at all follow that what one\r\nperson fancies another person cares about. A perusal of the work\r\nitself will enable its readers to find out what they like for\r\nthemselves, while the following brief remarks on the twelve stories\r\nalluded to above will give a scanty outline of them.\r\n\r\nThe tale of Aziz and Azizah is one of the best in the whole\r\ncollection. It represents the care and fondness of a truly loving\r\nwoman, who did her best to shield and protect her very stupid cousin.\r\nIt is said that people marry for three reasons, viz., for love, for\r\nmoney, or for protection. In truth, nobody can protect a man from a\r\nwoman as another woman. No man can drive off a woman, divine her\r\nintention, or insult her so violently as a woman can, and this is\r\ngenerally understood both in the East and West. In the present story,\r\nAzizah first helps her cousin Aziz to woo and win, endeavouring to\r\nshield and protect him at the same time from this daughter of Dalilah,\r\nthe wily one. Had it not been for Azizah's good advice and farewell\r\nsaying of \"Faith is fair, and unfaith is foul,\" Aziz would have surely\r\nperished. Eventually, the loving Azizah dies of a broken heart.\r\n\r\nAziz, though repeatedly warned by his mistress, the daughter of\r\nDalilah, not to have anything to do with the sex on account of his\r\nyouth and simplicity, falls into the hands of another woman, who first\r\nmarries him, and then keeps him locked up in her house, and never lets\r\nhim out for a whole year. When, however, he does get away for a day\r\nonly, he goes at once to see his former mistress, who is furious on\r\nhearing that he is married to somebody else, and with the aid of her\r\nslave girls serves him out in a way which, from one point of view,\r\nmakes marriage quite a failure for him in the future. On going back to\r\nhis wife, she, having found out what had occurred, immediately puts\r\nhim into the street, and he returns in a sad plight to his mother, who\r\nnurses him and gives him the present and the letter that his cousin\r\nAzizah had left for him. Finally Aziz, for the sake of distraction,\r\ntakes to foreign travel, and there meets with Taj al Muluk, whom he\r\nassists to find the princess Dunya.\r\n\r\nThe tale of Kamar Al-Zaman and the Lady Budur is both amusing and\r\ninteresting. It is truly an Eastern story, full of curious and\r\nwonderful situations, and quite a kaleidoscope of passing events,\r\nwhich succeed each other rapidly. The hero and the heroine are a young\r\nprince and princess, living in very different parts of the world\r\n(space and geography have no place in the \"Nights\"), and both very\r\naverse to matrimony. The one fears the smiles and wiles of woman, the\r\nother the tyranny and selfishness of man. A certain Queen of the\r\nJinns, with her assistants, bring the two together one night in the\r\nsame bed, and separate them in the morning. But the sight that each\r\nhad had of the other caused them to fall desperately in love, and deep\r\nare the lamentations of each over the separation, which continues for\r\nsome years. At last Kamar Al-Zaman finds his way to his lady-love, the\r\nPrincess Budur, and they are happily wedded; alas! after a short time,\r\nto be again separated. Then follow the adventures of each--the lady\r\nbecomes a king, and is married to a princess, and rules a country,\r\nwhile Kamar Al-Zaman's fate assigns him the place of an\r\nunder-gardener. Destiny, however, re-unites them, and the Lady Budur's\r\njoke before recognition and re-union is certainly humorous. She makes\r\nhim further marry the lady that she herself was married to, and a son\r\nis born to each, respectively called Amjad and Asaad. When the boys\r\ngrow up, the mother of each falls violently in love with the son of the\r\nother, _i.e._, Budur adores Asaad, and Heyat en Nufus worships Amjad,\r\nand the two mothers end by making dishonourable proposals to the two\r\nsons. These overtures being indignantly rejected, the mothers, as in\r\nall Eastern tales, turn the tables by informing their husband that his\r\nsons had made indecent proposals to them. In consequence they are sent\r\noff to be slain in the desert, but, from the circumstances which occur\r\nthere, the executioner spares their lives, and returns with their\r\nclothes steeped in a lion's blood, reporting that he has carried out\r\nthe king's instructions, and quoting their last message to their\r\nfather:\r\n\r\n     'Women are very devils, made to work us dole and death;\r\n       Refuge I seek with God Most High from all their craft and\r\n       skaith.\r\n     Prime source are they of all the ills that fall upon mankind,\r\n       Both in the fortunes of this world and matters of the faith.'\r\n\r\nThe king at once recognises their innocence, and mourns over their\r\nloss, building two tombs in their memory, called the Houses of\r\nLamentations, where he spends his days weeping.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two youths, left to their own devices by the\r\nexecutioner, journey onward, arrive at a city, become separated, go\r\nthrough all sorts of adventures, all of a most thrilling description,\r\nand are finally re-united. The closing scene brings all the characters\r\nof the romance together at the same place, and the grandfathers,\r\nfathers, and sons all meet once more, but no further mention is made\r\nabout the two mothers, who so deeply injured their own offspring.\r\n\r\nAla Aldin Abu Al-Shamat.--This story is of considerable interest, for\r\nit begins with a recipe for an aphrodisiac, and contains many\r\nallusions to Eastern manners and customs. Born of wealthy parents at\r\nCairo, details are given of Ala Aldin's youth and boyhood, and of how\r\nthe wish to travel and to trade was instilled into his mind by his\r\nyoung companions, at the instigation of a crafty old sinner, Mahmud of\r\nBalkh. With some reluctance his father at last allows him to start,\r\nand going first to Damascus, then to Aleppo, he is robbed of all his\r\nproperty just before he reaches Baghdad, and very nearly loses his\r\nlife into the bargain, but his good fortune saves him on two\r\noccasions. Arrived at Baghdad, his adventures begin, and they follow\r\neach other with considerable rapidity. He first is married to Zobeidah\r\nthe Lutist, on the understanding that it was for one night only, and\r\nthat he was to divorce her the next morning, so that she might be\r\nre-married to her former husband. But when the time comes, Ala Aldin\r\nand the lady find each other such pleasant company that they absolutely\r\ndecline to divorce, and elect to pay the fine. This money is provided\r\nfor them by Harun-ar-Rashid, who visits them one night with three of\r\nhis companions all disguised as dervishes, and they are charmed with\r\nZobeidah's performance on the lute, her singing, and her recitations.\r\n\r\nAla Aldin then goes to the Court, where he rises to high favour and\r\nreceives various good appointments. To his great grief he loses his\r\nwife, who dies, as he supposes, and is buried with the usual mourning,\r\nbut in reality turns up again at the end of the tale, and is re-united\r\nto her husband. It appears that a servant of the Jinn had carried her\r\noff to another country, leaving a Jinneyah to be buried in her place.\r\n\r\nTo make up for the loss of Zobeidah, the Khalif gives Ala Aldin one of\r\nhis own slave-girls, Kut al Kulub by name, and sends her, with all her\r\nbelongings, to his house. Ala Aldin will not have anything to do with\r\nher, on the grounds--\"What was the master's should not become the\r\nman's;\" but he lodges, boards, and treats her handsomely. Eventually\r\nHarun takes her back, and orders a slave-girl to be bought at his\r\nexpense in the market for ten thousand dinars for Ala Aldin. This is\r\ndone, and a girl named Jessamine is purchased and given to him. He\r\nsets her at once free and marries her.\r\n\r\nBut at the time of the purchase another man had been bidding for this\r\nsame girl, and, being much in love with her, his family determine to\r\nassist him in getting hold of her. A whole lot of fresh characters\r\nthen appear on the scene, and, after much plotting and intrigue, Ala\r\nAldin is arrested and sentenced to death. He, however, escapes to\r\nAlexandria, and there opens a shop. Further adventures follow, till he\r\nfinds himself at Genoa, where he remains for some time as servant in a\r\nchurch. Meanwhile at Baghdad his wife Jessamine has borne him a son,\r\nnamed Asdan, who grows up, and in time discovers the author and nature\r\nof the theft of which his father had been accused, and thus prepares\r\nthe way for his return to the city of the Khalifs. This is brought\r\nabout by the Princess Husn Maryam at Genoa, with whom Ala Aldin finds\r\nhis first wife Zobeidah, and they all set out on a wonderful couch and\r\ngo first to Alexandria, then to Cairo to visit his parents, and\r\nfinally to Baghdad, where he marries the princess and lives happy ever\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nAli the Persian and the Kurd Sharper is a very short story, but quite\r\nRabelaisian in its humour, and the manner in which the Persian and the\r\nKurd describe the contents of the small bag that had been lost. All\r\nsorts of things are mentioned in a haphazard way, many of them,\r\nhowever, perhaps, being required to fulfil the exigencies of the\r\nrhymed prose in which the story is written in the original Arabic.\r\n\r\nThe Man of Al-Yaman and his six Slave-Girls.--The six girls in this\r\nstory have all different qualities. One is white, another brown, the\r\nthird fat, the fourth lean, the fifth yellow, and the sixth black. The\r\nhappy owner gets them together, and in verse and recitation each\r\npraises her own peculiarity, and abuses that of her opposite by\r\nexamples and quotations. There is an Oriental twang about the story\r\nwhich makes it worthy of notice, and some of the verses are not bad.\r\n\r\nAbu Al-Husn and his slave-girl Tawaddud.--This story is not amusing,\r\nbut it is very interesting, especially to persons studying the minute\r\ndetails of the Muhammadan faith, doctrine and practice, according to\r\nthe Shafai school, and the exegesis of the Koran, all of which are\r\nwonderfully expounded by the slave-girl. In the shape of questions and\r\nanswers an enormous amount of information of all sorts is put into the\r\nmouth of this highly accomplished female. The writer deals not only\r\nwith theology, but also with physiology in all its branches, or, at\r\nleast, with as many as were known at the period of the tale. Further,\r\nmedicine, astronomy, philosophy, and all kinds of knowledge are\r\ndiscussed. A series of conundrums are put to the girl and replied to\r\nby her, and she also displays her skill in chess, draughts,\r\nbackgammon, and music.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the exact date of this species of\r\nMangnall's Questions and Answers cannot be ascertained, for this would\r\nenable us to appreciate better the amount of knowledge displayed on\r\nthe various subjects under discussion. Anyhow, it is certain that it\r\nmust have been written some time after the doctrines of the Imam\r\nShafai (he died A.D. 820) had been well-defined and established. Owing\r\nto certain medical and surgical queries and replies, it is to be\r\npresumed that the whole must have been worked up after the Arab school\r\nof medicine and physiology had arrived at their highest stage of\r\nperfection. The whole story is a good specimen of the state of\r\ncivilization reached by the Arabs, and as such is worth a reference.\r\n\r\nThree other stories in the 'Nights' bear some affinity to the above,\r\nbut they are much more limited, both as regards the subject they deal\r\nwith and the information they supply. One is 'King Jali'ad and his\r\nvizier Shimas,' in Payne's eighth and Burton's ninth volume; another,\r\n'History of Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf and the young Sayyid,' in Burton's\r\nfifth supplemental; and the third, 'The Duenna and the King's Son,' in\r\nhis sixth supplemental.\r\n\r\nThe Rogueries of Dalilah the Crafty, and her daughter, Zeynab the\r\nTrickstress.--The tricks played by Dalilah the Crafty on all sorts of\r\npeople in this story are of a nature that would make the tale amusing\r\nto the Arabs generally, and to the frequenters of coffee-houses\r\nparticularly. Dalilah's father and husband had held lucrative\r\nappointments under the Khalifs of Baghdad, and, with a view to obtain\r\nsomething for herself and her daughter Zeynab, these two women\r\ndetermined to bring themselves to notice by playing tricks, and doing\r\nthings which were likely to be talked of in the great city. In Europe\r\nat the present time the same method is often followed. Attempted\r\nassassinations, attempted suicides, complaints in the police-courts\r\nand cases in the law-courts are sometimes meant simply as an\r\nadvertisement.[7] Anyhow, Dalilah's tricks played on various people\r\nare certainly amusing, and as they run ingeniously one into the other,\r\nit is somewhat difficult to describe them in a few words. The tale, to\r\nbe appreciated, must be read through. Sufficient to add that Dalilah\r\nand Zeynab both eventually obtain what they wish, and the various\r\nthings taken from the different parties are duly returned to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 7: As an example take the following extract\r\n     from the _Daily Telegraph_ of 16th July, 1889:\r\n\r\n     'The sisters Macdonald have been giving a great deal more\r\n     trouble to the police lately than even the bearers of so\r\n     historic a name are entitled to give. Ethel Macdonald\r\n     appeared at Marlborough Street charged with having wilfully\r\n     smashed a window at the Junior Carlton Club, St. James's\r\n     Square. It was stated that the aggressive Ethel was one of\r\n     the daughters of an ex-superintendent of county constabulary\r\n     deceased, and that his daughters, being left unprovided for,\r\n     had taken to going on the \"rampage.\" One of the sisters\r\n     alleges that she has been wronged by \"a rich man,\" and a\r\n     short time since another Miss Macdonald, on being arraigned\r\n     before Mr. Newton, flung a bottle at the head of that\r\n     learned magistrate. Ethel was discharged, but it was ordered\r\n     that she should be sent to the workhouse for inquiries to be\r\n     made into her state of mind.']\r\n\r\nThe Adventures of Quicksilver Ali of Cairo.--This story is of the same\r\nnature as the preceding one, and in all the editions of the 'Nights'\r\nthe one always follows the other, while in the Breslau text the two\r\nstories run together. Ali begins life at Cairo, and ends at Baghdad,\r\nwhere his tricks and adventures follow each other in rapid succession,\r\nhis object being to obtain in marriage the hand of Zeynab, the\r\ndaughter of Dalilah the Crafty. He is first tricked himself by Zeynab,\r\nbut continues his pursuit of her, and though at times he is\r\ntransformed into the shapes of an ass, a bear, and a dog by the magic\r\narts of Azariah the Jew, eventually he succeeds, with the aid of the\r\nJew's daughter, in obtaining the property required, and finally\r\nmarries Zeynab, the Jewess, and two other women.\r\n\r\nHasan of Busra and the King's Daughter of the Jinn.--This is a good\r\nspecimen of a real Oriental romance, with the wonderful and marvellous\r\nadventures of the hero interlaced with magic, alchemy, the Jinns, and\r\nother fabulous varieties, so that the highest ideals of the\r\nimagination are almost arrived at.\r\n\r\nBahram the Magician, who first beguiles Hasan with alchemy and then\r\ncarries him off and endeavours to destroy him, is himself destroyed in\r\nthe early part of the story. The kindness of the seven princesses to\r\nHasan during his stay with them, and his visits to them later on, are\r\ndescribed at length, as also is the way in which the hero falls\r\ndesperately in love with the king's daughter of the Jinn, and secures\r\nher as his bride. The happy pair start for Busra, and rejoin his\r\nmother, and then settle down in Baghdad, where two sons are born and\r\nhappiness reigns supreme. But during Hasan's absence on a visit to his\r\nformer friends the seven princesses, some domestic scenes between his\r\nwife, his mother, and Zobeidah, the spouse of the Khalif\r\nHarun-ar-Rashid, are introduced, which end by the wife re-possessing\r\nherself of her original feather garment, and flying off with her two\r\nchildren to the islands of Wac, where her father and family resided.\r\n\r\nOn his return Hasan is broken-hearted to find her gone, and determines\r\nto set out and try and recover her. Then follows the description of\r\nhis journeys, which fill pages describing the white country, and the\r\nblack mountain, the land of camphor, and the castle of crystal. The\r\nislands of Wac were seven in number, peopled by Satans and Marids, and\r\nwarlocks and tribesmen of the Jinn. To reach them Hasan has to\r\ntraverse the island of birds, the land of beasts, and the valley of\r\nJinn. Without the aid of the princesses, their uncle Abdul-cuddous,\r\nAbourruweish, Dehnesh ben Fectesh, Hassoun, king of the land of\r\nCamphor, and the old woman Shawahi, he never would have reached his\r\ndestination. This, however, he finally does, and with the aid of a\r\nmagic cup and wand recovers his wife and children, and returns with\r\nthem to Baghdad, where they live happily ever afterwards, till there\r\ncame to them the Creditor whose debt must always be paid sooner or\r\nlater, the Destroyer of delights, and the Severer of societies.\r\n\r\nAli Nur Al-din and Miriam the Girdle-Girl (called by Payne, the Frank\r\nKing's Daughter).--The adventures of Ali with Miriam, whom he first\r\nbuys as a slave-girl in Alexandria, and from whom he is separated and\r\nre-united, again separated and again united, are told at some length.\r\nBut the principal features in this tale are the innumerable verses in\r\npraise of various fruits, flowers, wine, women, musical instruments,\r\nthe beauty of the hero, etc., and on the subjects of love, union,\r\nseparation, etc. Miriam herself is a charming character of\r\nself-reliance and independence. On her first appearance in the slave\r\nmarket, at the time of her sale, she declines to be purchased by the\r\nold men, and abuses their age and their infirmities. Indeed, she\r\nseemed to be of the same opinion as our great national poet, who\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n    'Crabbed age and youth\r\n     Cannot live together;\r\n     Youth is full of plaisance,\r\n       Age is full of care;\r\n     Youth like summer morn,\r\n     Age like winter weather;\r\n     Youth like summer brave,\r\n       Age like winter bare.\r\n     Youth is full of sport,\r\n     Age's breath is short,\r\n       Youth is nimble, age is lame;\r\n     Youth is hot and bold,\r\n     Age is weak and cold,\r\n       Youth is wild and age is tame.\r\n     Age, I do abhor thee;\r\n     Youth, I do adore thee;\r\n       O my love, my love is young;\r\n     Age, I do defy thee,\r\n     O sweet shepherd, hie thee,\r\n       For methinks thou stay'st too long'.\r\n\r\nHowever, she finally consents to be bought by the young and\r\ngood-looking Ali, who spends his last thousand dinars in her purchase,\r\nand then has nothing to live upon. Miriam remedies this by making every\r\nnight a beautiful girdle, which Ali sells for a good price in the\r\nbazaar next day. This goes on for upwards of a year, when the first\r\nseparation is brought about by the crafty old Wazir of her father, the\r\nKing of France, who had sent him especially to look for his daughter.\r\nIn the course of the adventures that follow, Miriam shows her capacity\r\nin sailing ships and in killing various men, among others her three\r\nbrothers, who pursued her in her last flight from her father's city.\r\nEventually she and Ali get to Baghdad, where the Khalif makes things\r\nsmooth for them, and they are married, and finally return to Cairo to\r\nrejoin Ali's parents, from whom he had run away in his youth.\r\n\r\nKamar Al-Zaman and the Jeweller's Wife is one of the modern tales of\r\nthe 'Nights,' and a very good one, containing a good plot and plenty\r\nof interesting incidents. The jeweller's wife, Halimah by name, is one\r\nof the wickedest and craftiest of women in Busra, and her plots and\r\nintrigues are well described; some of them are to be found in Persian\r\nstory-books. After playing all sorts of tricks, she leaves her\r\nhusband, and elopes with the youth Kamar to Cairo, where his parents\r\nreside. There his father will not let him marry her, but confines her\r\nand her slave-girl in a room, and arranges a marriage for his son with\r\nanother woman. After a time Halimah's husband, Obayd, the jeweller,\r\nturns up in Cairo in the most beggarly plight, having been plundered\r\nby Bedouins _en route_. After explanations, Obayd ends by killing\r\nhis wife and her slave-girl, who had assisted her in all her\r\ndevilries, and Kanar's father marries him to his daughter, who turns\r\nout the most virtuous of women. The moral of the tale is pointed out\r\nat the end, that there are both bad women and good women in the world,\r\nand is closed with the remark: 'So he who deemeth all women to be\r\nalike, there is no remedy for the disease of his insanity.'\r\n\r\nMa'aruf the Cobbler and his wife Fatimah commences with a domestic\r\nscene between the two, from which it appears that the poor husband had\r\nbeen shamefully sat upon from the day of his marriage, and that his\r\nwife was a dreadful woman. Affairs, however, at last reach a climax,\r\nand Ma'aruf seeks peace and safety in flight. Balzac, in his clever\r\nnovel of 'Le Contrat de Mariage,' makes his hero Manerville fly from\r\nthe machinations of his wife and mother-in-law, but Henri de Marsay,\r\nwriting to his friend pages on the subject, contends that he is wrong,\r\nand points out to him the course that he should have followed. Anyhow,\r\nin Ma'aruf the Cobbler's case, the result is satisfactory. Arriving by\r\nthe aid of a Jinn at a far-away city, he found a friend, who directed\r\nhim how to behave, and to tell everybody that he was a great and\r\nwealthy merchant, but that his merchandise was still on the way, and\r\nexpected daily. Pending the arrival of his baggage-train, Ma'aruf\r\nborrowed from everybody, gave it all away in largesse to the poor, and\r\nbehaved generally as if he were very well-to-do. By these means he\r\nmade such an impression on the King of the place that the latter\r\nmarried him to his daughter, and made large advances from the treasury\r\nin anticipation of the arrival of the merchandise.\r\n\r\nTime goes on, but still the baggage does not turn up. The King,\r\ninstigated by his Wazir, becomes suspicious, and persuades his\r\ndaughter to worm out the real story from her husband. This she does in\r\na clever way, and Ma'aruf tells her his true history. The woman\r\nbehaves admirably, refuses to expose his vagaries, and, giving him\r\nfifty thousand dinars, advises him to fly to a foreign country, to\r\nbegin to trade there, and to keep her informed of his whereabouts and\r\nthe turn of his fortunes. The Cobbler departs during the night, while\r\nhis wife the next morning tells the King and the Wazir a long\r\nrigmarole story of how her husband had been summoned by his servants,\r\nwho had informed him that his baggage-train and merchandise had been\r\nattacked by the Arabs, and that he had gone himself to look after his\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ma'aruf departs sore at heart, weeping bitterly, and, like\r\nall 'Arabian Nights' heroes in adversity, repeating countless verses.\r\nAfter various adventures he falls in with a vast treasure, and a\r\ncasket containing a seal ring of gold, which, when rubbed, causes the\r\nslave of the seal ring, naturally a Jinn, to appear and carry out\r\nevery wish and order that Ma'aruf might give him. With the aid, then,\r\nof the Jinn, Abu Al-Saddat by name, the Cobbler returns to his wife\r\nladen with treasure and merchandise, and thus proves to all the\r\ndoubters that he is a true man. He pays all his debts, gives a great\r\ndeal to the poor, and bestows presents of an enormous value on his\r\nwife, her attendants, and all the people of the Court.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, all this prosperity is followed by adversity.\r\nThe King and his Wazir combine together, and ask Ma'aruf to a\r\ngarden-party, make him drunk, and get him to relate the story of his\r\nsuccess. Recklessly he shows the ring to the Wazir, who gets hold of\r\nit, rubs it, and on the appearance of the slave of the ring, orders him\r\nto carry off the Cobbler and cast him down in the desert. The Wazir then\r\norders the King to be treated in the same way, while he himself seizes\r\nthe Sultanate, and aspires to marry Ma'aruf's wife, the King's\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nWith much interesting detail the story relates how the Princess Dunya\r\ngets the ring into her possession, sends the Wazir to prison, and\r\nrescues her father and her husband from the desert. The Wazir is then\r\nput to death, and the ring is kept by the lady, as she thinks it would\r\nbe safer in her keeping than in that of her relations. After this a\r\nson is born, the King dies, Ma'aruf succeeds to the throne, and\r\nshortly after loses his wife, who before her death gives him back the\r\nring, and urges him to take good care of it for his own sake and for\r\nthe sake of his boy.\r\n\r\nTime goes on, and the Cobbler's first wife, Fatimah, turns up in town,\r\nbrought there also by a Jinn, and tells the story of the want and\r\nsuffering she had undergone since his departure from Cairo. Ma'aruf\r\ntreats her generously, and sets her up in a palace with a separate\r\nestablishment, but the wickedness of the woman reappears, and she\r\ntries to get hold of the ring for her own purposes. Just as she has\r\nsecured it she is cut down and killed on the spot by Ma'aruf's son,\r\nwho had been watching her proceedings, and is thus finally disposed\r\nof. The King and his son then marry, and live happily in the manner of\r\nEastern story, all the other characters being properly provided for.\r\n\r\nSo much for the 'Nights' proper. Other stories translated from the\r\nBreslau text (a Tunisian manuscript acquired, collated and translated\r\nby Professor Habicht, of Breslau, Von der Hagen, and another; 15\r\nvolumes, 12mo., Breslau, 1825), the Calcutta fragment of 1814-1818,\r\nand other sources, have been given by Payne in three extra volumes\r\nentitled 'Tales from the Arabic,' and by Burton in two of his six\r\nvolumes of the 'Supplemental Nights.' Payne's three books and Burton's\r\ntwo first volumes follow the same lines. They both contain twenty\r\nprincipal, and sixty-four subordinate stories, or eighty-four\r\naltogether, divided into nine short stories and seventy-five longer\r\nones. Some of them are very interesting, and some are amusing,\r\nespecially a few of the sixteen Constables' Stories, which describe\r\nthe cleverness of women, and the adroitness of thieves, and people of\r\nthat class. It is probable that these are more or less of a modern\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe first story in this collection, called 'The Sleeper and the\r\nWaker,' commonly known as 'The Sleeper Awakened,' is good, and also\r\nparticularly interesting as one of Galland's stories not traced at the\r\ntime, but afterwards turning up in the Tunis text of the 'Nights.'\r\n\r\nThe third volume of Burton's 'Supplemental Nights' is one of the most\r\ninteresting of the whole lot. It contains eight principal and four\r\nsubordinate stories of Galland's 'Contes Arabes,' which are not\r\nincluded in the Calcutta, Boulak, or Breslau editions of the 'Nights.'\r\nFor many years the sources from which Galland procured these tales\r\nwere unknown. Some said that he invented them himself. Others\r\nconjectured that he got them from the story-tellers in Constantinople\r\nand other places in the East. But in A.D. 1886 Mr. H. Zotenberg, the\r\nkeeper of Eastern Manuscripts in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris,\r\nobtained a manuscript copy of the \"Nights,\" which contained the Arabic\r\noriginals of the stories of \"Zayn Al Asnam,\" and of \"Aladdin,\" two of\r\nGalland's best stories. This was a very valuable acquisition, for it\r\nsets at rest the doubts that had always been expressed about the\r\norigin of these two tales, and also leads to the supposition that the\r\nArabic originals of the other stories will also turn up some day.\r\n\r\nOf these eight principal and four subordinate stories of Galland,\r\nthose of \"Aladdin; or, The Wonderful Lamp,\" and of \"Ali Baba and the\r\nForty Thieves,\" have ever been most popular tales, and have been\r\nappreciated by many generations from the time that Galland first\r\nintroduced them to Europe. But some of the other stories are equally\r\ngood, and all are worth reading, as Burton has not only taken Galland\r\nas a guide, but has also adapted his own translation from the\r\nHindustani version of the Gallandian tales, prepared by one Totárám\r\nShayán, whose texts of the \"Nights,\" along with those of others, are\r\nfully discussed. By this method Burton endeavoured to preserve the\r\nOriental flavour of the work itself, without introducing too much\r\nFrench sauce.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of the Arabic original of the stories of\r\n\"Zayn Al-Asnam\" and \"Aladdin,\" Payne recognized its importance, and\r\npublished his translation of these two tales in a separate volume in\r\n1889, which forms a sort of appendix to his previously issued twelve\r\nvolumes. This thirteenth book contains also an interesting introduction,\r\ngiving a _résumé_ of Mr. Zotenberg's work, published at Paris in 1888,\r\nand which contains the Arab text of the story of Aladdin, along with\r\nan exhaustive notice of certain manuscripts of the \"Thousand and One\r\nNights,\" and of Galland's translation.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and fifth volumes of Burton's \"Supplemental Nights\" contain\r\ncertain new stories from an Arabic manuscript of the \"Nights\" in seven\r\nvolumes, brought to Europe by Edward Wortley Montague, Esq., and\r\nbought at the sale of his library by Dr. Joseph White, Professor of\r\nHebrew and Arabic at Oxford, from whom it passed into the hands of Dr.\r\nJonathan Scott, who sold it to the Bodleian Library, at Oxford, for\r\nfifty pounds.\r\n\r\nWortley Montague's manuscript contains many additional tales not\r\nincluded in the Calcutta, Boulak, or Breslau editions, and these\r\nadditional stories Burton has now translated. It is uncertain how or\r\nwhere Wortley Montague obtained his copy of the 'Thousand and One\r\nNights.' Dr. White had at one time intended to translate the whole\r\nlot, but this was never accomplished. Jonathan Scott did, however,\r\ntranslate some of the stories, which were published in the sixth\r\nvolume of his 'Arabian Nights Entertainment' in A.D. 1811, but the\r\nwork was badly and incompletely done. It has now been thoroughly\r\nrevised and put into better form by Burton in these two volumes.\r\n\r\nIn Appendix I. to Volume V. there is a catalogue of the contents of\r\nthe Wortley Montague MS., which is very interesting, as it contains\r\nnot only a description of the manuscript itself, but also a complete\r\nlist of the tales making up the \"Thousand and One Nights,\" many of\r\nwhich are, of course, to be found in the \"Nights\" proper.\r\n\r\nThese two supplemental volumes contain 25 principal and 31 subordinate\r\nstories, or 56 in all. Some of them are very amusing, especially the\r\ntales of the Larrikins, while the whole add to our knowledge of this\r\nvast répertoire of tales from the East, which has been gradually\r\nbrought to the notice of Europe during the last one hundred and\r\neighty-five years.\r\n\r\nBurton's sixth supplemental volume contains certain stories taken from\r\na book of Arabian tales, a continuation of the 'Arabian Nights\r\nEntertainment,' brought out by Dom Chavis, a Syrian priest, and\r\neventually teacher of Arabic at the University of Paris, and Mr.\r\nJacques Cazotte, a well-known French _littérateur,_ unfortunately and\r\nunjustly guillotined in Paris on the 25th September, 1792, at the time\r\nof the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThis work, sometimes called 'The New Arabian Nights,' is an imitation\r\nof Galland's marvellous production, and may be considered a sort of\r\ncontinuation of it. Dom Chavis brought the manuscripts to France, and\r\nagreed with Mr. Cazotte to collaborate, the former translating the\r\nArabic into French, and the latter metamorphosing the manner and\r\nmatter to the style and taste of the day. The work first appeared in\r\n1788-89, and was translated into English in 1792.\r\n\r\nBurton, in his Foreword to this volume, gives a full account of these\r\nstories, as translated and edited by Chavis and Cazotte. He himself\r\ngives a translation of eight of them, one of which, The Linguist, the\r\nDuenna, and the King's Son, is interesting, as it contains a series of\r\nconundrums, questions and answers, which may remind the reader of the\r\nstory of Abu Al-Husn and his slave-girl Tawaddud, in the 'Nights'\r\nproper, and of the history of Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf and the young\r\nSayyid, from the Wortley Montague MS. In addition to the eight\r\ntranslated stories, the sixth volume contains a great deal of matter\r\nin the shape of appendices, such as--Notes on Zotenberg's work on\r\nAladdin and on various manuscripts of the 'Nights'; Biography of the\r\nwork and its Reviewers Reviewed; Opinions of the Press, etc.; but\r\nthough well worthy of perusal by the curious, space does not allow of\r\nfurther allusions to them here.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, shortly, Payne's thirteen volumes contain 193\r\nprincipal, and 159 subordinate stories, or 352 in all, while Burton's\r\nsixteen volumes contain 231 principal, and 195 subordinate stories, or\r\n426 altogether. These numerous stories, translated from the Calcutta\r\n(1814-18), Calcutta Macnaghten (1839-42), Boulak (Cairo, 1835-36),\r\nBreslau (Tunis), Wortley Montague, Galland and Chavis texts may be\r\nconsidered to form what is commonly called 'The Arabian Nights\r\nEntertainment.' They date from A.D. 750, which may be considered as\r\nthe year of their commencement and that of the Abbaside dynasty, and\r\ngo on, continually added to, up to A.D. 1600, or even later. Many\r\nauthors have had a hand in the work, the stories themselves having\r\nbeen derived from Indian, Persian, Arabian, Egyptian, Syrian and\r\nGrecian sources, and adapted, more or less, for Arab readers and\r\nhearers. And as the manuscripts in some of these stories in different\r\ncountries do not in any way tally, it must be supposed that no such\r\nwork as an original copy of the 'Thousand and One Nights' has ever\r\nbeen in existence. The repertoire, consisting of a few stories at\r\nfirst, has gradually grown to such a size that now it may almost be\r\nconsidered to contain the largest and best collection of stories that\r\nthe world has, as yet seen.\r\n\r\nMention has been already made in a previous page of the 'Kathá Sarit\r\nSágara,' or Ocean of the Streams of Story, and a brief description of\r\nthis work was given in the third chapter of 'Early Ideas' (A.D. 1881).\r\nSince then a complete translation of the 'Kathá' has been made by\r\nProfessor C.H. Tawney, of the Calcutta College, and it has been\r\npublished in fourteen fasciculi, in the 'Bibliotheca Indica,' by the\r\nAsiatic Society of Bengal, 1880-1887. It is to be regretted, for the\r\nsake of the student and the anthropologist, that the translation is\r\npresented in an expurgated form. Still, the Professor has done his\r\nwork (and a long and tedious work it must have been) excessively well,\r\nwhile many of his notes, corrigenda and addenda are most interesting.\r\n\r\nThe 'Arabian Nights' and the 'Kathá Sarit Ságara' occupy respectively\r\nthe same position in Arabic and Hindoo literature. They are both\r\ncollections of tales adapted to the people of the country for which\r\nthey have been written. A perusal of both the works will show how much\r\nthey differ. The characters and ideas of the heroes and heroines,\r\ntheir thoughts, reflections, speeches, surroundings, and situations\r\nare worth studying in the two books as an exposition of the manners\r\nand customs, ideas and habits of two distinct peoples. The Hindoo\r\ncharacters, as depicted in their story-book, will be found to be\r\nduller, heavier, more reverential, and more superstitious than the\r\ncharacters in the 'Nights.' There are two things, however, common to\r\nthe two books: the power of destiny, and the power of love, against\r\nwhich it is apparently useless to struggle.\r\n\r\nWhile there are 426 stories in Burton's 'Nights,' there are 330 tales\r\nof sorts in Tawney's 'Kathá.' Both works are rather formidable as\r\nregards size and quantity of matter; still, after a start has been\r\nfairly made, the interest goes on increasing in a wonderful way, until\r\nat last one becomes absorbed and interested to a degree that can\r\nscarcely be imagined.\r\n\r\nThe stories in the 'Kathá Sarit Ságara' are supposed to have been\r\noriginally composed by one Gunádhya, in the Paisacha language, and\r\nmade known in Sanscrit under the title of 'Vrihat Kathá,' or Great\r\nTale. From this work one Bhatta Somadeva, in the eleventh century\r\nA.D., prepared the work now known as the 'Kathá Sarit Ságara,' but\r\nprobably stories have been added to it since. At present it consists\r\nof eighteen books, divided into one hundred and twenty-four chapters,\r\nand containing three hundred and thirty stories, along with other\r\nmatter. Of Gunádhya, the supposed original author, not much is known,\r\nbut Vatsyayana, in his 'Kama Sutra' (printed privately for the Kama\r\nShastra Society) mentions the name of Gunádhya as a writer whose works\r\nhe had consulted, and gives frequent quotations from them in his\r\nchapter on the duties of a wife. The exact date of Vatsyayana's life\r\nis also uncertain; some time not earlier than the first century B.C.,\r\nand not later than the sixth century A.D., is considered to be the\r\napproximate period of his existence.\r\n\r\nLike the 'Arabian Nights,' it is highly probable that the 'Kathá' grew\r\nby degrees to its present size. Gunádhya's original work is apparently\r\nnot now extant. Between the time it was written and the time that\r\nSomadeva produced his edition of it, many stories may have been added,\r\nand the same process may have continued afterwards. Somadeva, however,\r\nsays: 'I compose this collection, which contains the pith of the\r\n\"Vrihat Kathá.\"' Again he writes: 'This book is precisely on the model\r\nof that from which it is taken; there is not the slightest deviation;\r\nonly such language is selected as tends to abridge the prolixity of\r\nthe work; the observance of propriety and natural connection, and the\r\njoining together of the portions of the poem so as not to interfere\r\nwith the spirit of the stories, are as far as possible kept in view. I\r\nhave not made this attempt through desire of a reputation for\r\ningenuity, but in order to facilitate the recollection of a multitude\r\nof various tales.'\r\n\r\nThe 'Kathá Sarit Ságara' contains many stories now existing in the\r\n'Pancha Tantra,' or Five Chapters, in the 'Hitopodesa,' or Friendly\r\nAdvice, in the 'Baital Pachesi,' or Twenty-five Stories of a Demon,\r\nand other Indian story-books. Owing to the total absence of dates it\r\nis difficult to determine from what sources all these stories were\r\ncollected. But as some of the same fables and animal stories are to be\r\nfound in the 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' or Játaka Tales, in the\r\n'Arabian Nights,' and in the 'Kathá,' it may fairly be conjectured\r\nthat stories of this nature were in early years in considerable\r\ncirculation, and used as a means of conveying wisdom and advice both\r\nto the classes and to the masses in those prehistoric times.\r\n\r\nTo return to Arab story-books. Mention must be made of 'Antar,' a\r\nBedouin romance, which has been partially translated from the Arabic\r\ninto English by Terrick Hamilton, Secretary to the British Embassy at\r\nConstantinople, and published in London (1820). Mr. Clouston, in his\r\n'Arabian Poetry for English Readers,' Glasgow, 1881, has given an\r\nabstract of the story, with some specimens of translations from the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nThe work itself is generally supposed to have been written by\r\nAl-Asmai, the philologist and grammarian (born A.D. 740, died A.D.\r\n831), who flourished at the court of Harun-ar-Rashid, and was a great\r\ncelebrity in his time. It is probable that many of the stories told\r\nabout Antar and his wonderful deeds came down orally and traditionally\r\nto Al-Asmai, who embellished them with his own imagination, aided by a\r\nwonderful knowledge of the language and idioms used by the Arabs in\r\ntheir desert wilds.\r\n\r\nAntar is the hero, and Abla the heroine, of the romance. Antar himself\r\nis supposed to have lived during the sixth century A.D., and to have\r\nbeen the author of one of the seven famous poems suspended at Mecca,\r\nand known as the Mua'llakat. Besides this he was distinguished as a\r\ngreat warrior, whose deeds of daring were quite marvellous. The\r\ntranslator had intended to divide the work into three parts. The first\r\nends with the marriage of Antar and Abla, to attain which many\r\ndifficulties had to be overcome. The second part includes the period\r\nwhen Antar suspends his poem at Mecca, also a work of considerable\r\ndifficulty. The third part gives the hero's travels, conquests, and\r\ndeath. Mr. Hamilton only translated and published the first part of\r\nthe three, and the two others have not yet been done into English.\r\n\r\nThe romance of Antar, though tedious, is interesting, as it gives full\r\ndetails of the life of the Arabs before Muhammad's time, and even\r\nafter, for the Arab life of to-day is apparently much the same as it\r\nwas three thousand years ago. It appears to be an existence made up of\r\ncontinual wanderings, constant feud and faction, and perpetual\r\nstruggles for food, independence and plunder. But in the deserts on\r\nthe frontiers of Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia and Baghdad, it is said\r\nthat the various tribes are now kept much more in subjection by the\r\nTurks, owing to the introduction of the breech-loader, against which\r\nthe Arab and his matchlock and his peculiar mode of warfare is\r\nsomewhat powerless.\r\n\r\nWhile the 'Arabian Nights' are supposed to treat more of the\r\ninhabitants of the towns, the romance of Antar deals more with the\r\ninhabitants of the desert. To the student of the Arabic language both\r\nworks are interesting, as they occupy a prominent and standard place\r\nin Arabian literature, and afford much information about the manners\r\nand customs, ideas and peculiarities of an ancient and interesting\r\nrace of people. It must be admitted that both Antar and the 'Arabian\r\nNights' are so long that they rather try the patience of readers not\r\nparticularly interested in them. Nowadays in England the daily press\r\nsupplies such a mass of information of all sorts in connection with\r\nevery branch of society, that a constant and persistent reader of our\r\ndaily and weekly newspapers can find in them quite an 'Arabian Nights\r\nEntertainment' without going further afield. Indeed, the stories\r\nconcerning the cures effected by certain patent medicines are as\r\nwonderful as anything one ever reads in the 'Nights' themselves.\r\n\r\nAnd in addition to the realities and actualities of life, as daily\r\ntold in our newspapers and law reports, many of which do certainly\r\nprove that fact is stranger than fiction, there are numerous writers\r\nwho keep the public supplied with tales and stories of every kind and\r\ndescription. And from the great demand for such productions, whether\r\nissued as the penny dreadful, the thrilling story, or the regulation\r\nromance in three volumes, one conclusion can only be drawn, which\r\nis--that the human mind, everywhere in the East, West, North and South,\r\nis always anxious to be fed or amused with something startling or\r\nromantic, dreadful or improbable, exciting or depressing.\r\n\r\nIt is to be presumed, then, that the 'Nights' filled the vacuum in the\r\nminds of the people of that day in the East, much the same as the\r\nbooks and newspapers of our time satisfy the cravings of the\r\nhumanities of the West, who still seem to be ever in search of\r\nsomething new, even if not true; something original, even if not\r\ntrustworthy. Human nature appears to be much the same in all ages and\r\nat all times, and the scandals connected with high persons, the\r\nmemoirs and reminiscences of celebrated ones, and the good sayings of\r\nwitty ones, have always found much favour with the public generally,\r\nwhether told as stories, published as books, or printed in the papers.\r\nArabic literature abounds with biographical details and stories about\r\ncelebrated and distinguished men. It was always the custom and fashion\r\nto fill their works with much information of the kind. The same\r\nfashion appears to exist in England at the present time, with this\r\nadvantage, however, that we now get all the details and stories direct\r\nfrom the heroes themselves, and during their lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nANECDOTES AND ANA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Persian literature there are three celebrated works (Sa'di's\r\n'Gulistan,' or Rose Garden, A.D. 1258; Jawini's 'Negaristan,' or\r\nPortrait Gallery, A.D. 1334; and Jami's 'Beharistan,' or Abode of\r\nSpring, A.D. 1487, all translated by the Kama Shastra Society),\r\ncontaining an entertaining collection of stories, verses, and moral\r\nmaxims. In Arabic literature there are many books of the same sort,\r\nand in this chapter it is proposed to give a few specimens of stories\r\nand philosophic reflections culled from various authors. This will\r\nperhaps be more interesting than a lengthened analysis of the works\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe following anecdotes have been taken from the 'Naphut-ul-Yaman'\r\n(Breeze or Breath of Yaman), a collection of stories and poetical\r\nextracts of various Arabic authors, edited by Ahmad-ash-Shirwani.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAl-Jahiz said: 'I never was put so much to shame as when a woman met\r\nme on the road and said, \"I have some business with you,\" and I\r\nfollowed her till we reached the shop of a goldsmith, when she said,\r\n\"Like this man,\" and walked away. I stood amazed, and asked the\r\ngoldsmith to explain the matter. He replied: \"This woman wanted me to\r\nmake her a figure of Satan, and I told her that I did not know his\r\nphysiognomy; whereon she brought you!\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA voracious man paid a visit to a hermit, who brought him four loaves,\r\nand then went to fetch a dish of beans; but when he had come with it,\r\nhe found that his guest had consumed the bread. Accordingly he\r\ndeparted to bring some more bread, but when he returned with it he saw\r\nthat the man had devoured the beans. This proceeding was repeated ten\r\ntimes, whereon the host asked his guest to what place he was\r\ntravelling. He replied, 'To Rei.' 'Wherefore?' 'I heard of a\r\ncelebrated physician in that town, and I mean to consult him about my\r\nstomach, because I have but little appetite for eating.' 'I have a\r\nrequest to make of you.' 'What is it?' 'When you return, after having\r\nrecovered your appetite, please do not pay me a visit again.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day the poet Abu Nuwas made his appearance at the gate of the\r\npalace of Rashid, who, as soon as he was informed of this, called for\r\neggs, and said to his courtiers: 'Here is Abu Nuwas at the door. Now\r\nlet each of you take an egg and place it under his body, and when he\r\nenters I shall feign to be angry with all of you, and shall exclaim:\r\n\"Now lay eggs each of you, and if you do not I shall order you all to\r\nbe beheaded,\" and we shall see how he will behave.' Then the poet was\r\nadmitted, and the conversation continued. After a while, however, the\r\nKhalif became angry, and manifested his displeasure by exclaiming:\r\n'You are all like hens, and meddle with things that do concern you;\r\nnow lay eggs each of you, for that is your nature, or I shall order\r\nyour heads to be struck off.' Then he looked at the courtier on his\r\nright, saying: 'You are the first; now lay an egg.' Accordingly he\r\nmade great efforts, and contorting his features, at last drew forth an\r\negg. Then the Khalif addressed the others successively in the same\r\nmanner, and when the turn of Abu Nuwas came, he struck his sides with\r\nhis hands, and crowing like a cock, said: 'My lord, hens are useless\r\nwithout a cock. These are hens, and I am their cock.' Hereon the\r\nKhalif burst out laughing, and approved of his excuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain king was much addicted to women, and one of his viziers\r\nwarned him of the danger. Shortly afterwards some of his concubines\r\nobserved that his behaviour towards them had changed, and one of them\r\nsaid: 'My lord, what is this?' He replied: 'One of my viziers\r\n(mentioning his name) advised me not to love you.' 'Then,' said the\r\ngirl, 'present me to him, O king, and do not reveal what I shall do to\r\nhim.' Accordingly he gave the girl away, and when the vizier was alone\r\nwith her, she made herself so amiable that he fell in love with her,\r\nbut she refused to grant him any favour except on condition of\r\nallowing her first to ride on his back. He agreed. Accordingly she\r\nbridled and saddled him, but meanwhile sent word to the king what was\r\ntaking place; and when he arrived he saw the vizier in the position\r\nalluded to, and said: 'You warned me of the love of woman, and this is\r\nthe state I see you in.' The vizier replied: 'O king! this is just\r\nwhat I warned you of!'\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce a lion, a fox, and a wolf were associates in the chase, and after\r\nthey had killed an ass, a gazelle, and a hare, the lion said to the\r\nwolf: 'Divide the prey among us;' whereon the latter said: 'The ass\r\nwill be yours, the hare the fox's, and the gazelle mine;' and the lion\r\nknocked his eye out. Then the fox said: 'A curse on him, what a silly\r\ndivision he proposed!' Accordingly the lion said: 'Then do you make\r\nthe division, O possessor of the brush!' And the fox said: 'The ass\r\nwill be for your dinner, the gazelle for your supper, and the hare for\r\nyour luncheon.' The lion said: 'You rogue! who taught you to make such\r\na just distribution?' and Reynard answered, 'The eye of the wolf.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain king asked his vizier whether habit can vanquish nature, or\r\nnature habit? The vizier replied: 'Nature is stronger, because it is a\r\nroot, and habit a branch, and every branch returns to its root.' Now\r\nthe king called for wine, and a number of cats made their appearance\r\nwith candles in their paws, and stood around him; then he said to the\r\nvizier: 'Do you perceive your mistake in saying that nature is\r\nstronger than habit?' The vizier replied: 'Give me time till this\r\nevening.' The king continued: 'You shall have it.' Accordingly the\r\nvizier appeared in the evening with a mouse in his sleeve, and when\r\nthe cats were standing with their candles, he allowed it to slip out,\r\nwhereon all the cats threw down the candles and ran after it, so that\r\nthe house was nearly set on fire. Then the vizier said: 'Behold, O\r\nking, how nature overcomes habit, and how the branch returns to the\r\nroot.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 'Merzubán námah,' translated from the Persian into Arabic, is said\r\nto be of very ancient origin, and to embody good maxims in fables. It\r\nwas composed, or is supposed to have been composed, by one of the old\r\nprinces of Persia called Merzuban, a brother of the King Nausherwan\r\nthe Just, who died A.D. 578. On referring to the great encyclopædical\r\nand bibliographical dictionary, edited by Fluegel, it will be found,\r\nunder No. 11,783, that Haji Khalfa mentions this book, giving,\r\nhowever, its title only, without mentioning the time of its\r\ncomposition, nor the author of it, nor the language in which it had\r\nbeen written. The following are some extracts from this work, and the\r\nstories resemble others that have come from the Farther East.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe philosopher Merzubán said: 'I am informed that in a certain\r\ndistrict of Aderbaijan there is a mountain as high as the sky, with\r\nfine brooks, trees, fruits and herbs. Under the shelter of one of the\r\nmost beautiful trees a pair of partridges lived most happily, but in\r\nthe vicinity there was likewise a powerful eagle with his brood, who\r\nperiodically visited the abode of the partridges and devoured their\r\nyoung ones. When the pair had thus several times lost their progeny,\r\nthe male proposed that it would either be necessary for them to\r\nemigrate to some other locality, or to try some expedient by which\r\nthey might escape from the rapacity of the eagle. He was of opinion\r\nthat even in case of failure they might gain some valuable experience\r\nthat would be of use in future attempts to elude the persecution, and\r\nsaid: \"We must at all events make a trial, and may learn something\r\nfrom it, like the donkey who endeavoured to become the companion of\r\nthe camel.\" The she-partridge asked, \"How was that?\" and the male\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'\"Once a donkey tried to keep up walking with a big camel, who paced\r\nlustily, and took long steps, but the ass, being in a hurry, stumbled\r\nevery moment, and found that he had undertaken an impossible task. He\r\nasked the camel, 'How is it I wound my hoofs on the rocks so often,\r\nalthough I constantly look where I am stepping; whilst you, who\r\napparently walk with leisure, never cast a glance at any of the\r\nobstacles you meet with, and never hurt yourself?' The camel replied:\r\n'The reason is just because you are short-sighted and of weak\r\nintellect; you can look no further than your nose, and are, therefore,\r\ndisappointed; whereas I look always forward, know the obstacles I am\r\nlikely to encounter, scan the road to a great distance, and avoid the\r\ndifficulties, selecting the easiest parts of the way.'\" The wise hen\r\nsaid: \"To be forewarned is to be forearmed, and this principle I\r\nfollow.\" \"I have narrated this story to show you that we must look\r\nforward, now that the time of laying eggs is at hand, because when our\r\nlittle ones are hatched it may again be too late to try and save\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n'The female partridge said: \"This is all very well, but we might fare\r\nlike the hungry fox who would have lost his life if the ichneumon had\r\nnot interceded for him with the camel.\" The male said \"How was that?\"\r\nand the female continued:\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n'\"It is related that a certain fox had a fine large den, in which he\r\ncollected provisions for the winter and for the summer, fared\r\nsumptuously, and never suffered from want. Once, however, a large army\r\nof ants invaded his domicile, and made short work of all the victuals\r\nhe had carefully stored. This misfortune befel him just at a time when\r\nthe weather happened to be very cold and food scarce, so that he began\r\nto feel the pangs of hunger. One morning, however, when he was about\r\nto sally forth from his den, he perceived, to his no small\r\nastonishment, at the mouth of it a camel kneeling, with the hinder\r\npart of his body turned towards him. The fox said to himself, 'Here is\r\ngood luck,' and made a foolhardy attempt to drag the animal into the\r\ncave by tying a rope to its tail, and to commence pulling at it with\r\nall his might. To make sure of his prey the fox had tied the other end\r\nof the rope to his own body, but when he began to jerk it rather\r\nstrongly the camel became vexed, jumped up suddenly, and first\r\ndischarging both urine and dung upon Reynard, began to shake himself\r\nviolently. The fox dangled in the air, and was repeatedly knocked\r\nagainst the flanks of the gigantic animal. Then the fox repented of\r\nhis silly attempt to feast on camel meat, and knew that his\r\ndeath-knell would shortly sound. Luckily an ichneumon happened to be\r\nstanding close by, amazed at the strange spectacle, and the fox\r\nimplored it to intercede for him. Accordingly, the ichneumon addressed\r\nthe camel in the following strain: 'Friend giant! it is meet that the\r\nstrong, hoping for an eternal reward, should have mercy upon the weak!\r\nHere is a poor stranger who has accidentally become entangled with\r\nyour tail. He will be strangled; you may save his life and become his\r\ndeliverer by letting him go.' The camel then released the fox, who\r\nwould assuredly have lost his life if the ichneumon had not interceded\r\nfor him.\" When the male partridge had heard this story he fully\r\napproved of the moral of it, which is to the effect that ignorant and\r\nweak individuals are generally foiled in their designs against those\r\nwho are powerful. He therefore considered that it would be best to\r\nthrow themselves upon the mercy of the eagle, and said: \"We must pay a\r\nvisit to his majesty the eagle, explain our case to him, implore his\r\nmercy, and enroll ourselves among the number of his servants. We may\r\nsucceed by gaining his favour; he is the king of all the birds, and\r\ncarnivorous, but for all we know his disposition may be so merciful\r\nthat he will spare our offspring not only himself, but order all the\r\nother birds of prey, his subjects, to do likewise.\"\r\n\r\n'Then the she-partridge exclaimed: \"Your advice is indeed wonderful!\r\nYou propose nothing less than that we should court our own perdition,\r\nand of our own accord run into a trap! The eagle in treacherous, and\r\nwould deal with us like the heron dealt with the little fish.\" The\r\nmale said, \"Please narrate the occurrence,\" and the female continued:\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n'\"A heron had taken up his abode, and had lived for a long time near a\r\nbrook on the little fishes there. At last, however, he became so old\r\nand weak that he was scarcely able to provide his daily food. He was\r\nonce standing in a melancholy attitude on the bank of the streamlet,\r\nwaiting for a chance to satisfy his hunger, when he happened to catch\r\nsight of a beautiful little fish disporting itself in the water, and\r\nmourned over his inability to get hold of it. The little fish\r\nperceived the heron standing immovable, and apparently taking not the\r\nleast notice of it; therefore it gradually ventured to approach him,\r\nand asked the cause of his melancholy. The heron replied, 'I am\r\nreflecting upon the time of my youth which has passed away, the life I\r\nenjoyed, the pleasures I felt, all of which are irretrievably lost,\r\nand have left behind nothing but repentance for my sins, a weak body,\r\nand tottering limbs. I can now only regret the depredations I have\r\ncommitted, and wash away with my tears the stains of my\r\ntransgressions. How often have I given occasion, both to little fishes\r\nand to eels, to deplore the loss of members of their families, which I\r\nhad greedily devoured; but I have now repented, and shall henceforth\r\ndo so no more.' When the little fish had heard this wonderful\r\nconfession it asked: 'What can I do for you?' The heron replied: 'I\r\nwant you only to convey this declaration of mine, with my salutations,\r\nto all your acquaintances, with the information that they may\r\nhenceforth live in perfect safety, and need not apprehend any\r\ndepredations on my part. There must, however, be covenants and pledges\r\nof security between us.' The little fish asked: 'How can I trust you,\r\nsince I am the food on which you subsist, and you cannot be inclined\r\nto dispense with that.' He said: 'Take this grass and tie it round my\r\nneck for a sign that I shall not injure you.' Accordingly, the little\r\nfish took hold of a blade of grass, which was to serve for the heron's\r\ncollar, who then placed his beak near the surface of the water to\r\nreceive it, but as soon as the little fish had come within reach, the\r\nheron gobbled it up, and this was the end of the promised pledge. My\r\ndear husband, I have narrated this occurrence only to show that we\r\nwould, by trusting to any promises of magnanimity that the eagle might\r\nmake to us, only court our own perdition.\"\r\n\r\n'In spite of all her objections, however, the she-partridge agreed at\r\nlast to accompany her husband to the court of the eagle. They started\r\ntogether, travelled for some time, arrived at his abode, and made\r\ntheir obeisance to a courtier whose name was Yuyu, whom the male\r\npartridge addressed as follows: \"Most noble lord, we are denizens of\r\nan adjoining mountain, where we lived happily till his majesty the\r\neagle crushed all our hopes by making his appearance on our mountain\r\nwith his court of birds of prey, destroyed our young on several\r\nsuccessive occasions, and reduced us to despair. I proposed to my wife\r\nto emigrate, and she at last consented, so that we have now arrived\r\nhere and placed ourselves under the wings of your protection.\"' Yuyu\r\nwas pleased with these words, and replied: \"I bid you welcome, and\r\napprove of your sagacity which induced you to seek a refuge at the\r\ncourt of our most noble sovereign. I must, however, tell you that\r\nalthough his disposition is righteous, he feeds upon the meat of\r\nanimals, but when the weak and helpless crave his mercy, or implore\r\nhis aid, he seldom disappoints them; those, on the contrary, who\r\noppose or endeavour to deceive him must be prepared to fall under his\r\nwrath. He is honest and veracious, because he lives in solitude, and\r\nkeeps aloof from intercourse with mankind, because all agree that the\r\nsociety of men crushes out all good qualities, and is productive of\r\nmisery. You may now arise, and seek an audience from his majesty,\r\nbecause the opportunity will not present itself often. When you enter\r\nand make your obeisance you must watch his humour, which will be\r\nexcellent if he has been successful in the chase. Then you will behold\r\nhim social and chatting with his courtiers, whilst the nightingale,\r\nthe heron, and other birds are singing and dancing for his amusement,\r\nand you can then introduce the subject of your petition. But if you\r\nbehold him sitting dumb, with bloodshot eyes, or in an angry mood, say\r\nnothing if you value your life, and in any case, if you should\r\nperceive that silence is best, do not venture to speak.\"\r\n\r\n'After this advice the partridge flew with Yuyu up to a lofty peak of\r\nthe mountain, and alighted in a beautiful garden, fragrant with the\r\nperfume of flowers, where the eagle was sitting with his court, which\r\nconsisted of birds of every species. Then Yuyu presented himself\r\nbefore his majesty, and craved an audience for the partridge, which,\r\nhaving been granted, he was admitted and spoke as follows: \"Praise be\r\nto Allah, who has healed our wound and restored us to life! We lived\r\nin trouble and distress, but the justice of your majesty's government\r\nis the theme of every tongue; all our apprehensions have vanished, and\r\nwe hope for security under the wings of your protection, because it is\r\nsaid that a noble Sultan is to his subjects like a kind father to his\r\nchildren, and protects them against all evils.\"\r\n\r\n'The king replied: \"You are welcome in this region; here you may live\r\nin safety among the best of neighbours, and I grant you protection.\"\r\nAccordingly, the partridge returned to his spouse, whom he informed of\r\nthe condescension of his majesty, whose service both accordingly\r\nentered, and whose favour they afterwards gained, so that they lived\r\nhappily to the end of their days.'\r\n\r\nThe 'Merzubán námah' contains also several stories about Kesra\r\nNausherwan the Just, and his minister Buzarjimehr, but they are not\r\nvery interesting. The extracts given above sufficiently show the\r\nnature of this work, which puts into the mouths of animals how men and\r\nwomen ought to act under various circumstances, and it bears a strong\r\nresemblance in many ways to the 'Kalilah wa Dimnah.'\r\n\r\nTwo stories have been selected from the celebrated Arabic work\r\nentitled 'Al--Mustatraf,' or 'The Gleaner,' or 'The Collector.' The\r\nfull title of this work is 'Al-Mustatraf min kell finn al-mustazraf,'\r\nwhich may be translated thus: 'Gleanings from every kind of Elegant\r\n(or Pleasing) Composition.' The similarity of the first and last word\r\nof the title is attributable to the fondness of the Arabs for\r\nalliterative or rhyming titles. As there are several meanings attached\r\nto the word Mustatraf in the dictionaries, it might also be\r\ninterpreted as 'The Book of Pleasing Novelties.' It contains an\r\nanthology of anecdotes, stories, proverbs, and elegant extracts by\r\nShaikh Muhammad Bin Ahmad Al-Bashihi. The work is mentioned by Fluegel\r\nin his edition of Haji Khalfa's great work.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbas, the chief of the police of the Khalif Mamun, said: 'One day I\r\nwas present in an assembly of the Prince of the Faithful, before whom\r\na man was standing heavily fettered with chains of iron. As soon as\r\nthe Khalif perceived me he said: \"Abbas, take good care of this man,\r\nand produce him again to-morrow.\" Accordingly I called for some of my\r\npeople, and they carried him away, because he was so heavily shackled\r\nthat he could scarcely move. Considering that I had been ordered to\r\ntake every care of this prisoner, I concluded that I had better keep\r\nhim in my own house, in a chamber of which I then confined him. I\r\nasked him what place he had come from, and on his replying that it was\r\nDamascus, I expressed my best wishes for the prosperity of that town,\r\nwhereat he was astonished. I told him that I had been there, and asked\r\nhim about a certain man; he said that he would like to know how I\r\ncould be acquainted with him, and on my replying that I had had some\r\nbusiness with him, he promised to satisfy my curiosity if I gave him\r\nfirst some information. Accordingly I made the following statement:\r\n\r\n\"When I was with some other officials at Damascus the population\r\nrebelled against us, and even the governor was under the necessity of\r\nescaping by getting himself let down in a basket from his palace. I\r\nalso fled, and whilst doing so the mob pursued me, and I ran into the\r\nhouse of the above-mentioned man, who was sitting at the door of it. I\r\nsaid to him: 'Help me and Allah will help you!' He received me kindly,\r\nand told his wife to put me into a certain room, whilst he remained\r\nsitting at the door. I had scarcely gone in when my pursuers likewise\r\nrushed in and insisted on searching the house, which they actually\r\ndid, and would certainly have discovered me had not the man's wife\r\nkept them off from the room in which I sat trembling for my life. When\r\nthe people at last dispersed, the man and his wife comforted me as\r\nmuch as they could, and hospitably entertained me in their house for\r\nfour months, till every danger had passed away. When I was bold enough\r\nto go out and see what had become of my slaves, I found that they had\r\nall dispersed, and I asked my kind host to allow me to depart to\r\nBaghdad. He consented, but when the caravan was starting he insisted\r\non presenting me with a horse, a slave, and all the provisions\r\nrequired for the journey. All these were surprises thrust upon me when\r\nI was about to start, and was wondering how I could possibly travel\r\nwithout any of these things. Moreover, during my whole sojourn this\r\nkind man had never asked me my name for fear that I might thereby be\r\ncompromised. After I had safely arrived in Baghdad I desired many a\r\ntime to show my gratitude to this man, but could obtain no information\r\nabout him. I still desire to requite his services, and this is the\r\nreason why I was so anxious to learn something about him from you.\"\r\n\r\n'After the man had listened to the above statement he said: \"Verily,\r\nAllah has enabled you to requite the kindness of that man.\" I asked:\r\n\"How can that be?\" and he replied: \"I am that man, but the trouble in\r\nwhich you see me has hindered you from recognising me.\" Then he\r\nreminded me of various circumstances, and so established his identity\r\nthat I was perfectly convinced of it, and could not restrain myself\r\nfrom embracing him most fervently. To my inquiries how he had fallen\r\ninto the calamity which had overtaken him, he replied:\r\n\r\n\"A disturbance arose in Damascus similar to the rebellion which had\r\nbroken out when you were there; the Prince of the Believers sent\r\ntroops and suppressed it, but I, having been suspected as one of the\r\nringleaders thereof, was captured by his command, brought as a\r\nprisoner to Baghdad, and considered to have forfeited my life, which I\r\nshall certainly lose. I left my family without taking leave, but a\r\nslave of mine has followed me here, and will carry back information\r\nabout me. He is to be found at such and such a place, and if you will\r\nsend for him I will give him the necessary instructions. I shall\r\nconsider it a high favour, and as a reward for all the obligations\r\nunder which you were to me.\"\r\n\r\n'I told him to put his trust in Allah, and got a smith to relieve him\r\nfirst of his irons, then I made him enter the bath, provided him with\r\ngood clothes, and sent for his slave, to whom he gave, with tears in\r\nhis eyes, the message for his family. I then ordered my people to get\r\nready several horses and mules, which I loaded with baggage and\r\nprovisions, gave the man a bag of ten thousand dirhems, with another\r\nof five thousand dinars, and ordered my lieutenant to escort him on\r\nhis journey to Damascus as far as Anbar.' But the man replied: \"The\r\nPrince of the Believers considers that I have committed high treason,\r\nand will send troops to pursue me; I shall be recaptured and executed,\r\nand by allowing me to escape you will endanger your own life.\" I said:\r\n\"Never mind what will became of me, but save your life, and I shall\r\nafterwards endeavour to save mine.\" He rejoined: \"That shall not be,\r\nand I cannot leave Baghdad without knowing what has become of you.\"\r\nSeeing him determined in his purpose, I ordered my lieutenant to take\r\nhim to a certain place in the town where he could remain in\r\nconcealment till the next day, when he might be informed as to whether\r\nI had extricated myself from the difficulty, or had lost my life, in\r\nwhich latter case I should only have repaid him for having risked his\r\nin Damascus to save mine, and after that he could depart.\r\n\r\n'The lieutenant had taken the man away, and I made preparations for my\r\ndeath, getting ready my winding-sheet in which my corpse was to be\r\nshrouded, when an official on the part of Mamun arrived with this\r\nmessage: \"The Prince of the Faithful orders you to bring the man with\r\nyou.\" Accordingly I hastened to the palace, where I found the Khalif\r\nsitting and expecting me. The first words he said to me were these: \"I\r\nwant to see the man!\" I remained silent, and on his uttering them more\r\nemphatically, replied: \"Will you please listen to me, O Commander of\r\nthe Believers?\" He continued: \"I am determined to strike your head off\r\nif the man has fled.\" I said: \"O Prince of the Faithful, the man has\r\nnot escaped, but listen to what I have to say about him, and then you\r\nmay act as you deem fit.\" He continued: \"Speak!\" Accordingly I\r\nnarrated everything, and said that I was anxious to requite the man in\r\nsome measure for all the good he had done to me, that I was desirous\r\nto save his life even at the cost of my own, if need be, and finished\r\nmy explanation by showing the winding-sheet I had brought with me.\r\nAfter the Khalif had patiently listened, he exclaimed: \"His merit is\r\nsuperior to yours, because he has treated you nobly without knowing\r\nyou; whereas you only do so after having enjoyed his beneficence. I\r\ndesire to reward him myself.\" \"The man is here, and would not leave\r\nuntil apprized of my fate; I can produce him at once.\" The Khalif\r\nsaid: \"This trait of his character is yet more noble; go, comfort the\r\nman, and bring him here.\" Accordingly I departed, and when I\r\nintroduced the man to the Khalif, he received him kindly, offered him\r\na seat, conversed with him till dinner was brought in, of which he\r\nmade him partake in his own company. Lastly, the Khalif invested him\r\nwith a robe of honour, and wished to appoint him Governor of Damascus,\r\nbut this he humbly refused. Accordingly, Mamun presented him with ten\r\nhorses saddled and bridled, ten mules caparisoned, and ten bags, each\r\nof which contained ten thousand dinars; he also gave him ten slaves,\r\nwith animals to ride upon, and a letter to the Governor of Damascus to\r\nabsolve him from the payment of taxes. This man afterwards\r\ncorresponded with Mamun, and when a courier arrived from Damascus the\r\nKhalif used to say to me, \"Abbas! a letter from your friend has\r\narrived.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne night Harun-ar-Rashid was quite sleepless, and said to his vizier,\r\nJaafar, the son of Yahya, the Barmekide: 'I cannot sleep this night; I\r\nfeel oppressed, and do not know what to do.' The servant Masrur, who\r\nhappened to be standing near, burst out laughing at these words, and\r\nthe Khalif continued: 'What are you laughing for? Do you mock me or\r\nwish to show your levity?' Masrur said: 'I swear by your relationship\r\nto the Prince of Apostles that I have done this unwittingly; but last\r\nevening I was near the castle, and walked to the bank of the Tigris,\r\nwhere I saw many persons assembled around a man who made them laugh,\r\nand just now I recollected some of his words, which caused me to\r\nsmile; his name is Ben Almugázeli, and I crave pardon from the\r\nCommander of the Faithful.' Then Rashid said: 'Bring him here this\r\nmoment.' Accordingly Masrur went to Ben Almugázeli and said to him:\r\n'The Commander of the Faithful wants you.' He replied: 'To hear is to\r\nobey!' And Masrur continued: 'But on the condition that if he presents\r\nyou with anything, one-fourth of it will belong to you, and the rest\r\nto me.' The man rejoined: 'No, I must have one-third of it and you the\r\nother two-thirds.' Masrur would not agree to this proposal, but at\r\nlast consented after a great deal of haggling. When he was admitted\r\nand had made his salutations, the Khalif said: 'If you make me laugh I\r\nshall give you five hundred dinars, but if not I shall give you three\r\nblows with this sock.' Now Ben Almugázeli said to himself: \"What is\r\nthe odds if I get three strokes with the sock?\" because he thought it\r\nwas empty. Accordingly he began to jest and to play tricks at which\r\nlow people might have laughed, but not Rashid, who did not even smile.\r\nThe man was first astonished, then grieved, and at last frightened\r\nwhen Rashid said: \"Now you have deserved the blows.\" He then took up\r\nthe sock and twisted it, but at the bottom there were some balls, each\r\nof which weighed two drachms. When he had struck Ben Almugázeli once,\r\nthe latter yelled pitifully, but recollecting the condition Masrur had\r\nimposed upon him, he exclaimed: \"Mercy, O Commander of the Faithful,\r\nlisten to two words of mine.\" He said: \"Speak what you like.\" The man\r\ncontinued: \"I have promised Masrur to let him have two-thirds of the\r\nbounty I might receive, and to keep one-third for myself, and to this\r\nhe agreed only after much bargaining. Now the Commander of the\r\nFaithful has decided that the bounty shall consist of three blows, of\r\nwhich my share would be one, and Masrur's two. I have received mine,\r\nand now is his turn to take his.\" Rashid laughed, called for Masrur,\r\nand struck him; Masrur groaned from pain, and said: \"I present him\r\nwith the remainder.\" The Khalif laughed and ordered them to be\r\npresented with one thousand dinars, of which each received five\r\nhundred, and Ben Almugázeli went away grateful.'\r\n\r\nIn this work there are several other stories concerning various\r\nKhalifs, the Barmekide family, and other people, but the extracts\r\ngiven above are sufficient to show the nature of the volume.\r\n\r\nTwo short anecdotes are taken from the 'Sihr-ul-oyoon,' or 'Magic of\r\nthe eyes,' a work known to Haji Khalfa, and noted by Fluegel in his\r\nlexicon. This book contains seven chapters, with some drawings of the\r\neye, and an appendix consisting entirely of poetry, which, however, is\r\nalso interspersed throughout the work, excepting in the chapters\r\ntreating on the anatomy, the infirmities of, and the remedies for the\r\neye.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoghairah bin Shabah states that he never was so cunningly deceived as\r\nby a youth of the Benou-ul-Háreth. He intended to sue for the hand of\r\na girl of that tribe, when this youth, who stood near him, said: 'O\r\nAmir, you have no need of her.' 'Why?' 'I saw a man kiss her.'\r\nAccordingly Moghairah went away, but heard some time afterwards that\r\nthe said youth had married the girl himself. On meeting again\r\nMoghairah said to the youth: 'Did you not tell me that you had seen a\r\nman kiss her.' 'Certainly I did,' the young man replied, 'but that man\r\nwas her father.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA man happened to find on the road a silver brooch, which women use\r\nfor applying collyrium to their eyes. This pin was handsome, and he\r\nconcluded that the girl who had lost it must have very beautiful eyes.\r\nHe indulged so much in this fancy that he conceived an affection for\r\nthe owner of the brooch, and was fond of showing the precious article\r\nto his acquaintances. One day a friend paid him a visit, and after the\r\nwine they had drunk had taken effect, he took out the said brooch\r\naccording to his wont, kissed it, and wept over it. The friend, who\r\nknew the brooch, asked whence he had obtained it, but he replied:\r\n'Pray do not question me, I am in love with the proprietress of it; my\r\nheart is melting, and it is so dear to me that I get jealous when\r\nother eyes beside my own look at it.' The friend said: 'I shall bring\r\nabout a meeting between you and your mistress.' The other asked, 'Who\r\ncould procure me that felicity?' The friend went away, but returned in\r\na short time bearing a covered platter, which he placed before him,\r\nsaying, 'Uncover this basin,' and lo! it contained a female head,\r\nweltering in its own gore, and on beholding it the man nearly fainted\r\nwith grief. His friend, however, said: 'Be not dismayed, but tell me\r\nhow you obtained this brooch, which I had presented to my wife, whose\r\nhead is before you.' He replied that he had found the brooch on a\r\ncertain day on the road, and described the spot, adding that he\r\nimagined the owner of it must be beautiful, and conceived a warm\r\naffection for her, but that he had never seen her face, and knew not\r\nwho she might have been. The friend said: 'This is true enough,\r\nbecause she told me one day that she had lost it; hence no blame rests\r\non you.' The two men parted; the would-be lover, however, took this\r\nmelancholy event so much to heart that he not only repented of his\r\nfolly, but died of grief.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following curious philosophic discourse is taken from the\r\n'Siraj-ul-Mulûk,' or Lamp of Kings, a well-known work composed about\r\nA.D. 1126, and typographed at Cairo A.D. 1872:\r\n\r\n'Allah, the Most High, has said (Koran, vi., verse 38): \"There is no\r\nkind of beast on earth, nor fowl which flieth with its wing, but the\r\nsame is a people like unto you.\" Allah the Most High has accordingly\r\nestablished a resemblance between us and all the animals. It is well\r\nknown that they are not like us in their figures and forms as\r\nperceived by the eye, but in their demeanour; and there is not a human\r\nbeing who does not possess some qualities peculiar to animals. When\r\nyou perceive that a man's character is unusual, you must endeavour to\r\nfind out the qualities of the animal with which it may be compared,\r\nand judge of him according to these; and to avoid all\r\nmisunderstanding, and to maintain intercourse with him, you must\r\nbehave towards him in conformity with them.\r\n\r\n'Accordingly, when you see an ignorant man of rude behaviour, strong\r\nin body, whose anger overpowers him at any moment, you are to compare\r\nhim to a tiger, and there is an Arab proverb: \"He is more stupid than\r\na tiger.\" When you see a tiger, you avoid him, and do not fight with\r\nhim, therefore towards an individual of this kind you must behave in\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\n'When you observe a man wantonly attacking the reputation of others,\r\ncompare him to a dog, because it is his nature. When a dog barks at\r\nyou it does not trouble you much, and you go your own way. You must\r\ndeal in this manner with such men, because they are like dogs who\r\nassault others without any provocation.\r\n\r\n'When you perceive that a man's nature is to say \"Yes\" when you say\r\n\"No,\" and \"No\" if you say \"Yes,\" compare him to an ass, because when\r\nyou approach him he recedes, and when you move away he will move\r\ntowards you. You must put up with your donkey, and neither separate\r\nfrom him nor insult him. Deal in the same way with such a person.\r\n\r\n'When you perceive a man searching out the weaknesses or shortcomings\r\nof people, compare him to a fly, which settles on a carcase, and then\r\ngluts itself with the vilest parts of it, such as the rotten flesh and\r\nthe filthy offal.\r\n\r\n'When you observe a Sultan taking the lives, and confiscating the\r\nproperty of his subjects, consider him to be a lion, and be on your\r\nguard that he does not injure you.\r\n\r\n'When you see a wicked man full of tricks and boastings, compare him\r\nto a fox.\r\n\r\n'If you happen to meet with a tale-bearer who foments enmity among\r\nfriends, consider him to be a \"Zeriban,\" which is a small beast of\r\nfetid smell, so that when two persons fall out with each other, the\r\nArabs say that \"a Zeriban has passed between them.\" It is, indeed, the\r\npeculiarity of this animal that an assembly disperses when it enters,\r\naccordingly it is driven off as soon as perceived, and a tale-bearer\r\nought to be dealt with similarly.\r\n\r\n'When you observe that a man loathes to listen to intelligent\r\nconversation, and hates meetings of learned men, but is fond of\r\ngossip, all kinds of nonsense, and scandals of society, compare him to\r\nthe May-bug, which delights in impure exhalations, and loves\r\ndunghills, but hates the perfumes of musk or of roses, which actually\r\nkill it when sprinkled upon it.\r\n\r\n'If you meet an individual displaying a great deal of piety outwardly,\r\nbut always intriguing to acquire property, to enrich himself by\r\nunrighteous means, and to cheat widows and orphans, consider him to be\r\na wolf:\r\n\r\n     \"The wolf is so devout;\r\n      You see him on his knees,\r\n      He nicely prays and sighs.\r\n      But when his game is near,\r\n      He falls upon it speedily\r\n      And tears it all to pieces.\"\r\n\r\n'When you discover a liar consider him to be like a dead man, who can\r\ngive no information, and with whom no one can associate. A liar may\r\nalso be compared to an ostrich which buries all its eggs in the sand,\r\nbut leaves one upon the surface, and one close under it, whilst all\r\nthe others are deeply concealed. When an inexperienced man perceives\r\nthat egg he takes it, and perhaps also the one close below it, and\r\nafter scraping up the sand a little, and finding nothing more goes\r\naway; whilst a person who knows this habit of the ostrich does not\r\nstop searching until he has got possession of all the eggs. You must\r\ndeal in the same manner with a liar, and not believe him till you get\r\nto the bottom of his story, i.e. until you elicit the actual truth.\r\n\r\n'When you observe that a man's whole attention is absorbed in\r\nendeavours to make a good appearance by keeping his clothes nice, and\r\napprehensive lest they should be dirtied in any way, always picking\r\nany little straws that might adhere to them, and constantly adjusting\r\nhis turban, consider him to be a peacock, whose nature is always to\r\nadmire his own person, to stalk about majestically, to display the\r\nplumage of his tail, and to solicit praise of his beauty.\r\n\r\n'If you become acquainted with a rancorous person who never forgets\r\nthe slightest insult, but avenges himself for it even after a\r\nconsiderable lapse of time, compare him to a camel, for the Arabs\r\ntruly say of such a man that \"he is more rancorous than a camel.\"\r\nAvoid such a man as you would an ill-natured camel.\r\n\r\n'When you meet a hypocrite, who is different from what he appears to\r\nbe, compare him to the Yarbu, _i.e._ the mouse of the desert, which\r\nhas two apertures to its lair, the one for an entrance, and the other\r\nfor an exit, so that it always cheats the hunter who digs for it.'\r\n\r\nYet another story-book may be quoted, viz., the 'Ilam en Nâs,' or\r\nWarnings for Men, containing historical tales and anecdotes of the\r\ntime of the early Khalifates. Some of these were translated by Mrs.\r\nGodfrey Clerk in 1873 (King and Co.), and her little volume also\r\ncontains a very good genealogical table of the families of the\r\nProphet, and of the Rashidin (or 'rightly directed,' _i.e._ Abu Bakr,\r\nOmar, Othman, and Ali), the Omaiyide, and the Abbaside Khalifs.\r\n\r\nAmong the many works of Arabic literature one of the most interesting\r\nand the most amusing is Ibn Khallikan's celebrated Biographical\r\nDictionary. The author must have been a very intelligent and a very\r\nindustrious man, for his volumes contain an enormous amount of\r\ninformation about many hundred Arabs. This work is rendered all the\r\nmore readable and all the more amusing by the many anecdotes related\r\nin connection with their lives, and a few of these stories are now\r\ngiven below.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIbn Abbas, son of Abbas, uncle of Muhammad, was one of the ablest\r\ninterpreters of the Koran. It was owing to his efforts that the study\r\nof the poems, composed before the introduction of Islamism, became of\r\nsuch importance to the Muslims, for he frequently quoted verses of the\r\nancient poets in proof of the explanation he gave of different\r\npassages of the Koran, and he used to say: 'When you meet with a\r\ndifficulty in the Koran look for its solution in the poems of the\r\nArabs, for these are the registers of the Arabic nation.' On being\r\nasked how he had acquired his extensive knowledge, he replied: 'By\r\nmeans of an inquiring tongue and an intelligent heart.'\r\n\r\nIt may here perhaps be stated that the Koran, composed avowedly in the\r\npurest Arabic, offered many difficulties to those who were not\r\nacquainted with the idiom of the desert Arabs, a race who alone spoke\r\nthe language in its perfection. The study of the ancient poets was\r\ntherefore considered as necessary for the intelligence of the Koran,\r\nand their poems, often obscure from the intricacy of their\r\nconstruction and their obsolete terms, required the assistance of\r\ngrammatical analysis and philology to render them comprehensible.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIbn Faris Ar-Razi, the Philologist, is the author of these verses:\r\n\r\n'Well, some things succeed and some fail: when my heart is filled with\r\ncares I say: \"One day perhaps they may be dispelled.\" A cat is my\r\ncompanion; books the friends of my heart; and a lamp my beloved\r\nconsort.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nBadi Az-Zaman al-Hamadani, the author of some beautiful epistles and\r\nexcellent essays, which last Hariri took as a model in the composition\r\nof his, wrote as follows about death: 'Death is awful till it comes,\r\nand then it is found light; its touch seems grating till felt, and\r\nthen it is smooth; the world is so hostile and its injustice so great\r\nthat death is the lightest of its inflictions, the least of its\r\nwrongs. Look, then, to the right; do you see aught but affliction?\r\nLook to the left; do you see aught but woe?'\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbu Wathila Iyas Al-Kadi was renowned for his excessive acuteness of\r\nmind, observation, and penetration. Many stories are told about him in\r\nconnection with these qualities, which are really astonishing. It is\r\nrelated of him that he said: 'I was never worsted in penetration but\r\nby one man: I had taken my seat in the court of judgment at Busra,\r\nwhen a person came before me and gave testimony that a certain garden,\r\nof which he mentioned the boundaries, belonged to a man whom he named.\r\nAs I had some doubts of his veracity, I asked him how many trees were\r\nin that garden, and he said to me, after a short silence: \"How long is\r\nit since our lord the Kadi has been giving judgment in this hall?\" I\r\ntold him the time. \"How many beams,\" said he, \"are there in the roof?\"\r\nOn which I acknowledged that he was in the right, and I received his\r\ntestimony.'\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a curious circumstance that Homer the Greek poet, Radaki the\r\nPersian poet, and Bashshar bin Burd the Arabian poet, were all blind.\r\nHere is a specimen of one of the verses of the last-named:\r\n\r\n'Yes, my friends! my ear is charmed by a person in that tribe; for the\r\near is sometimes enamoured sooner than the eye. You say that I am led\r\nby one whom I never saw; know that the ear as well as the eye can\r\ninform the mind of facts.'\r\n\r\nHe composed also the following verse, which is the most gallant of any\r\nmade by the poets of that epoch:\r\n\r\n'Yes, by Allah! I love the magic of your eyes, and yet I dread the\r\nweapons by which so many lovers fell.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral sayings of Al-Hasan bin Sahl, the vizier to the Khalif\r\nAl-Mamun, have been preserved. Once he himself wrote at the end of a\r\nletter of recommendation, dictated to his secretary: 'I have been told\r\nthat on the day of judgment a man will be questioned respecting the\r\nuse he made of the influence given him by his rank in the world, in\r\nthe same manner as he will be questioned respecting the use he made of\r\nthe superfluity of his wealth.'\r\n\r\nAgain he said to his sons: 'My sons, learn the use of language; it is\r\nby it that man holds his preeminence over other animals; the higher\r\nthe skill which you attain in the use of language, the nearer you\r\napproach to the ideal of human nature.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is related of Sari-as Sakati, the celebrated Sufi, that he said\r\nthat for twenty years he never ceased imploring Divine pardon for\r\nhaving once exclaimed, 'Praise be to God!' and on being asked the\r\nreason he said: 'A fire broke out in Baghdad, and a person came up to\r\nme and told me that my shop had escaped, on which I uttered these\r\nwords; and even to this moment I repent of having said so, because it\r\nshowed that I wished better to myself than to others.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAl-Ahnaf bin Kais, whose prudence was proverbial among the Arabs, used\r\nto say: 'I have followed three rules of conduct, which I now mention\r\nmerely that the man of reflection may profit by my example--I never\r\ninterfered between two parties unless invited by them to do so; I\r\nnever went to the door of these people (meaning princes) unless sent\r\nfor by them; and I never rose from my place to obtain a thing when all\r\nmen were anxious to possess it.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbu Yazid Taifur al-Bastaimi, the famous ascetic, being asked how he\r\nhad acquired his knowledge of the spiritual world, answered that it\r\nwas by means of a hungry belly and naked body. He used to say: 'When\r\nyou see a man possessing miraculous powers, so as even to mount into\r\nthe air, let not that deceive you, but see if he observes God's\r\ncommands and prohibitions, if he keeps within the bounds imposed by\r\nreligion, and if he performs the duties which it prescribes.'\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbul Aswad ad-Duwali, the inventor of grammar, in intelligence one of\r\nthe most perfect of men, and in reason one of the most sagacious, was\r\nnotorious for his avarice, and he used to say: 'If we listened to the\r\ndemands made by the poor for our money, we should soon be worse off\r\nthan they.' He said also to his sons: 'Strive not to rival Almighty\r\nGod in generosity, for He is the most bountiful and the most glorious;\r\nhad He pleased He would have given ample wealth to all men, so strive\r\nnot to be generous lest you die of starvation.' It is also related\r\nthat Abul Aswad had an attack of the palsy, and that he used to go to\r\nthe market himself, though scarcely able to draw his legs after him,\r\nand yet he was rich, and possessed both male and female slaves. A\r\nperson who knew this accosted him one day, and said: 'God has\r\ndispensed you from the necessity of moving about on your own business,\r\nwhy do you not remain seated at home?' To which he replied: 'No; I go\r\nin and out, and the eunuch says \"He is coming,\" and the boy says \"He\r\nis coming,\" whereas, were I to continue sitting in the house, the\r\nsheep would urine upon me without any person's preventing them.'\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is related that on a dispute between the Sunnites and Shiites of\r\nBaghdad about the relative merits of Abu Bakr and Ali, both parties\r\nagreed to abide by the opinion of the Shaikh Abul Faraj bin Al-Jauzi.\r\nThey consequently deputed a person, who questioned him on the subject\r\nwhen he was seated in the preacher's chair. The one reply which he\r\nmade bears in Arabic two different meanings--the first, that the best\r\nof them was he whose daughter was married to the other man; and the\r\nsecond, that the best of them was he who had married the daughter of\r\nthe other man. He then withdrew promptly, lest he should be questioned\r\nfurther, and the Sunnites said: 'He means Abu Bakr, because his\r\ndaughter Ayesha was married to the Prophet,' 'Nay,' said the Shiites,\r\n'he means Ali, because Fatima, the Prophet's daughter, was married to\r\nhim.' The answer was certainly very clever; had it even been the\r\nresult of long reflection and deep consideration, it would have been\r\nadmirable, but coming as it did without any previous preparation, it\r\nwas still more so.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nShibab Ad-Din (flambeau of the faith) as-Suhrawardi was a pious and\r\nholy Shaikh, most assiduous in his spiritual exercises, and the\r\npractice of devotion, and successfully guided a great number of Sufis\r\nin their efforts to obtain perfection. Many persons wrote to him for\r\nhis opinion on circumstances which concerned themselves, and one wrote\r\nas follows: 'My lord,--If I cease to work I shall remain in idleness,\r\nand if I work I am filled with self-satisfaction; which is best?' To\r\nthis the Shaikh replied: 'Work, and ask Almighty God to pardon thy\r\nself-satisfaction.' The following is one of his verses:\r\n\r\n'If I contemplate you, I am all eyes; and if I think of you I am all\r\nheart.'\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbu Ali Al-Jubbai was an able master in the science of dogmatic\r\ntheology, and had at one time a pupil named Abul Hasan Al-Ashari. It\r\nis related that one day the two had the following discussion.\r\nAl-Ashari propounded to his master the case of three brothers, one of\r\nwhom was a true believer, virtuous and pious; the second an infidel, a\r\ndebauchee, and a reprobate; and the third an infant; they all died,\r\nand Al-Ashari wished to know what had become of them. To this\r\nAl-Jubbai answered: 'The virtuous brother holds a high position in\r\nParadise, the infidel is in the depths of hell, and the child is among\r\nthose who have obtained salvation.' 'Suppose now,' said Al-Ashari,\r\n'that the child should wish to ascend to the place occupied by his\r\nvirtuous brother, would he be allowed to do so?' 'No,' replied\r\nAl-Jubbai, 'it would be said to him: \"Thy brother arrived at this place\r\nthrough his numerous works of obedience towards God, and thou hast no\r\nsuch works to set forward.\"' 'Suppose, then,' said Al-Ashari, 'that\r\nthe child say, \"That is not my fault; you did not let me live long\r\nenough, neither did you give me the means of proving my obedience.\"'\r\n'In that case,' answered Al-Jubbai, 'the Almighty would say: \"I knew\r\nthat if I allowed thee to live thou wouldst have been disobedient, and\r\nincurred the severe punishment of hell; I therefore acted for thy\r\nadvantage.\"' 'Well,' said Al-Ashari, 'and suppose the infidel brother\r\nwere here to say: \"O God of the Universe! since you knew what awaited\r\nhim, you must have known what awaited me; why, then, did you act for\r\nhis advantage and not for mine?\"' Al-Jubbai had not a word to offer in\r\nreply. This discussion proves that the Almighty elects some for mercy,\r\nand others for punishment, and that his acts are not the results of\r\nany motive whatsoever.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is related that As-Shafi said: 'There are five men on whom people\r\nmust rely for the nourishment of their minds: he who wishes to become\r\nlearned in jurisprudence must have recourse to Abu Hanifah; he who\r\ndesires to become skilled in poetry must apply to Zoheir bin Ali\r\nSulma, the author of one of the Mua'llakas, or suspended poems at\r\nMecca; he who would like to become well acquainted with the history of\r\nthe Muslim conquests must obtain his information from Muhammad bin\r\nIshak; he who wishes to become deeply learned in grammar must have\r\nrecourse to Al-Kisai; and he who seeks to be acquainted with the\r\ninterpretations of the Koran must apply to Mukatil bin Sulaiman.'\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several stories current as to how the Khalif Omar bin\r\nAl-Khattab took upon himself the title of 'Commander of the Faithful.'\r\nOne is that Omar was one day holding a public sitting, when he said:\r\n'By Allah! I do not know what we must say. Abu Bakr was the successor\r\nof the Apostle of God, and I am the successor of the successor of\r\nGod's Apostle. Is there any title that can answer?' Those who were\r\npresent said: 'Commander (Amir) will do.' 'Nay,' said Omar, 'you are\r\nall commanders.' On this Al-Mughira said: 'We are the faithful, and\r\nyou are our Commander.' 'Then,' said Omar, 'I am the Commander of the\r\nFaithful.'\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbu Ali Yahya, the vizier of Harun-ar-Rashid, was the son of Khalid,\r\nand the grandson of Barmek. Yahya was highly distinguished for wisdom,\r\nnobleness of mind, and elegance of language. One of his sayings was:\r\n'Three things indicate the degree of intelligence possessed by him who\r\ndoes them: the bestowing of gifts, the drawing up of letters, and the\r\nacting as ambassador.' He used to say to his sons: 'Write down the\r\nbest things which you hear; learn by heart the best things which you\r\nwrite down; and in speaking utter the best things which you have\r\nlearned by heart.'\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIbn As-Sikkit, the philologist, related that Muhammad bin As-Summak\r\nused to say: 'He who knows mankind humours them; he who has not that\r\nknowledge thwarts them; and the main point in humouring mankind is to\r\nabstain from thwarting them.' The neglect of carrying out this maxim\r\ncost As-Sikkit his life. One day, whilst he was with the Khalif\r\nAl-Mutwakkil, that prince's two sons, Al-Motazz and Al-Muwaiyad, came\r\nin, and the Khalif said to him: 'Tell me, Yakub, which you like\r\nbest--these two sons of mine, or Al-Hasan and Al-Hussain, the sons of\r\nAli.' Ibn As-Sikkit answered by depreciating the merits of the two\r\nprinces, and giving to Al-Hasan and Al-Hussain the praise to which they\r\nwere well entitled. On this Al-Mutwakkil ordered his Turkish guards to\r\nchastise him, and they threw him down and trod on his belly. He was\r\nthen carried to his house, where he died two days afterwards, A.D.\r\n859.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree men met together; one of them expressed a wish to obtain a\r\nthousand pieces of gold, so that he might trade with them; the other\r\nwished for an appointment under the Emir of the Muslims; the third\r\nwished to possess the Emir's wife, who was the handsomest of women,\r\nand had great political influence. Yusuf bin Tashifin, the Emir of the\r\nMuslims, being informed of what they said, sent for the men, bestowed\r\none thousand dinars on him who wished for that sum, gave an\r\nappointment to the other, and said to him who wished to possess the\r\nlady: 'Foolish man! what induced you to wish for that which you can\r\nnever obtain?' He then sent him to her, and she placed him in a tent,\r\nwhere he remained three days, receiving each day, one and the same\r\nkind of food. She had him then brought to her, and said: 'What did you\r\neat these days past?' He replied: 'Always the same thing.' 'Well,'\r\nsaid she, 'all women are the same thing!' She then ordered some money\r\nand a dress to be given him, after which she dismissed him.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following anecdotes have been gathered from various sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain shepherd had a dog of which he was very fond, and which\r\nhaving, to his great grief, died, was buried by him with every mark of\r\naffection and regret. The Kadi of the village, whose ill-will the\r\nshepherd had in some way incurred, hearing of this, ordered him to be\r\nbrought before him on the serious charge of profanity in having mocked\r\nthe ceremonies of the Muhammadan religion, and buried an unclean\r\nanimal with sacred rites. On being asked what he had to say in his\r\ndefence, the prisoner thus addressed the magistrate: 'If your\r\nreverence will be pleased to hear my story, you will, I am sure,\r\nexcuse me. My dog's mother died when he was quite a puppy, and he was\r\nbrought up by a she-goat of my flock, who adopted him. When she died\r\nin her turn she left him all her property, consisting of several fine\r\nyoung kids. Now when my dog was taken ill, and found himself at the\r\npoint of death, I asked him what I should do with the kids which\r\nbelonged to him, and he replied: \"Give them to his reverence the\r\nKadi.\" I thought the animal so sensible for this that I gave him\r\nMuslim burial.' 'Quite right,' said his reverence. 'What else was the\r\nlamented deceased pleased to observe?'\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the language of birds and beasts is regarded as the\r\ngreatest divine gift, and was expressly vouchsafed, according to the\r\nKoranic legend, to Solomon, the son of David. It is related that one\r\nday Solomon was returning to his palace when he saw a cock and hen\r\nsparrow sitting near the gateway, and overheard the former telling the\r\nlatter that he was the person who had designed, and planned, and built\r\nall the surroundings. On hearing this Solomon remarked to the male\r\nbird that he must know he was telling a fearful lie, and that nobody\r\nwould believe him. 'That is true,' replied the sparrow, 'nobody\r\nprobably will believe my story except my wife; she believes implicitly\r\neverything that I say.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day a king was sailing in a boat with a negro slave, who was so\r\nseasick that his groans and lamentations disturbed the royal repose. A\r\ndoctor who happened to be present undertook to keep the slave quiet,\r\nand, on receiving permission to do so, ordered him to be thrown\r\noverboard, which was promptly done. The poor wretch managed with\r\ndifficulty to catch hold of the rudder of the boat, and, being taken\r\non board once more, sat shivering in a corner, and did not utter\r\nanother sound. The king, delighted with this result, asked the doctor\r\nhow he had silenced the fellow. 'Your Majesty will see,' was the\r\nreply, 'he had never before experienced the inconvenience of being\r\ndrowned, and did not properly appreciate the security of a boat.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day the Khalif Harun-ar-Rashid and his jester, the poet Abu Nuwas,\r\nwere disputing as to the truth of an axiom laid down by Abu Nuwas,\r\nthat 'an excuse was often worse than the crime,' and the poet offered\r\nto convince the monarch of it before the night was over. The Khalif,\r\nwith a grim humour peculiarly his own, promised to take off his\r\njester's head if he failed to do so, and went out in a rage. After\r\nawhile Harun came in a somewhat surly temper to his harem, and the\r\nfirst thing which greeted him was a kiss from a rough-bearded face. On\r\ncalling out violently for a light and an executioner, he found that\r\nhis assailant was Abu Nuwas himself. 'What on earth, you scoundrel, do\r\nyou mean by this conduct?' asked the enraged Sovereign. 'I beg your\r\nMajesty's most humble pardon,' said Abu Nuwas, 'I thought it was your\r\nMajesty's favourite wife.' 'What!' shrieked Harun, 'why the excuse is\r\nworse than the crime.' 'Just what I promised to prove to your\r\nMajesty,' replied Abu Nuwas, and retired closely followed by one of\r\nthe imperial slippers.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Arab whose camel had strayed swore an oath that he would, on\r\nfinding it, sell it for one dirhem. When he had again obtained\r\npossession of the animal he repented of his oath, but tied a cat to\r\nthe neck of the camel and shouted: 'Who will buy a camel for one\r\ndirhem, and a cat for a hundred dirhems? But I will not sell them\r\nseparately.' A man who was there said: 'How cheap would this camel be\r\nif it had no collar on the neck!' Something of the same kind happened\r\nin France the other day. A peasant died, leaving his property to be\r\nsold by his wife. Among other things there was a dog and a horse,\r\nwhich the woman put up for sale together, saying that the dog's price\r\nwas twenty pounds, and the horse's one pound, but that they must be\r\nsold together. It turned out that the deceased husband had left the\r\ndog to his wife, and the horse to another relation, the monies\r\nrealized by the sale of each to be paid to the respective parties.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Arab of the desert said to his boy: 'O son! on the day of\r\nresurrection thou wilt be asked what merit thou hast gained, and not\r\nfrom whom thou art descended; that is to say, thou wilt be asked what\r\nthy merit is, and not who thy father was.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA learned man relates the following: 'I stood with a friend on a road\r\nconversing with him when a woman halted opposite to me, looking at me\r\nsteadfastly. When this staring had passed all bounds, I despatched my\r\nslave to ask the woman what she was listening to. He came back and\r\nreported that the woman had said: \"My eyes had committed a great sin.\r\nI intended to inflict a punishment upon them, and could devise none\r\nworse than looking at that hideous face.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some good verses in the Arabic descriptive of the places\r\nwhere certain Arabs wished to be buried. It was Abu Mihjan, the\r\nThackifite, who chose the vineyard.\r\n\r\n     'Bury me, when I die, by the roots of the vine,\r\n     The moisture thereof will distil into my bones;\r\n     Bury me not in the open plain, for then I much fear\r\n     That no more again shall I taste the flavour of the grape.'\r\n\r\n  Another version:\r\n\r\n     'When the Death angel cometh mine eyes to close,\r\n       Dig my grave 'mid the vines on the hill's fair side;\r\n     For though deep in earth may my bones repose,\r\n       The juice of the grape shall their food provide.\r\n     Oh, bury me not in a barren land,\r\n       Or Death will appear to me dread and drear!\r\n     While fearless I'll wait what he hath in hand\r\n       If the scent of the vineyard my spirit cheer.'\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some of the wild people prefer the hill slopes, and\r\nan example is given in the address of the dying Bedouin to his tribe:\r\n\r\n     'O bear with you my bones where the camel bears his load,\r\n       And bury me before you, if buried I must be;\r\n     And let me not be buried 'neath the burden of the vine,\r\n       But high upon the hill whence your sight I ever see!\r\n     As you pass along my grave cry aloud, and name your names,\r\n       The crying of your names shall revive the bones of me,\r\n     I have fasted through my life with my friends, and in my\r\n       death\r\n     I will feast when we meet on that day of joy and glee.'\r\n\r\nThe French poet, Alfred de Musset's, gentle verses in his elegy to\r\nLucie, and which have been engraved on his tomb in Paris, at\r\nPère-Lachaise, run as follows:\r\n\r\n     'When I shall die, dear friends, aslant\r\n     My silent grave a willow plant;\r\n     I love its foliage weeping near,\r\n     To me its colour's sweet and dear;\r\n     Its shadow gray will lightly fall\r\n     Upon my tomb--a mourning pall,\r\n     And will likewise do the keeping\r\n     Of the ground where I am sleeping.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF TRANSLATIONS\r\n\r\n_Published under the patronage of the Old Oriental Translation Fund_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=From the Persian=.\r\n\r\n 1.
